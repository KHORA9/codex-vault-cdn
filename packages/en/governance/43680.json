It is for this\r\nreason that I have decided to publish these memoirs, in spite of the\r\ndifficulties of work in my present condition of a refugee, unable to\r\nrefer to any archives or documents and deprived of the possibility of\r\ndiscussing events with those who have taken part in them.\r\n\r\nThe first part of my book deals chiefly with the Russian Army, with\r\nwhich my life has been closely linked up. Political, social and\r\neconomic questions are discussed only in so far as I have found it\r\nnecessary to describe their influence upon the course of events.\r\n\r\nIn 1917 the Army played a decisive part in the fate of Russia. Its\r\nparticipation in the progress of the Revolution, its life, degradation\r\nand collapse should serve as a great warning and a lesson to the new\r\nbuilders of Russian life. This applies not only to the struggle against\r\nthe present tyrants. When Bolshevism is defeated, the Russian people\r\nwill have to undertake the tremendous task of reviving its moral and\r\nmaterial forces, as well as that of preserving its sovereign existence.\r\nNever in history has this task been as arduous as it is now, because\r\nthere are many outside Russia's borders waiting eagerly for her end.\r\nThey are waiting in vain. The Russian people will rise in strength\r\nand wisdom from the deathbed of blood, horror and poverty, moral and\r\nphysical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Russian Turmoil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE FOUNDATIONS OF THE OLD POWER: FAITH, THE CZAR AND THE MOTHER\r\nCOUNTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inevitable historical process which culminated in the Revolution\r\nof March, 1917, has resulted in the collapse of the Russian State.\r\nPhilosophers, historians and sociologists, in studying the course\r\nof Russian life, may have foreseen the impending catastrophe. But\r\nnobody could foresee that the people, rising like a tidal wave,\r\nwould so rapidly and so easily sweep away all the foundations of\r\ntheir existence: the Supreme Power and the Governing classes which\r\ndisappeared without a struggle; the intelligencia, gifted but weak,\r\nisolated and lacking will-power, which at first, in the midst of a\r\ndeadly struggle, had only words as a weapon, later submissively bent\r\ntheir necks under the knife of the victors; and last, but not least, an\r\narmy of ten million, powerful and imbued with historic traditions. That\r\narmy was destroyed in three or four months.\r\n\r\nThis last event--the collapse of the army--was not, however, quite\r\nunexpected, as the epilogue of the Manchurian war and the subsequent\r\nevents in Moscow, Kronstadt and Sevastopol were a terrible warning.\r\nAt the end of November, 1905, I lived for a fortnight in Harbin, and\r\ntravelled on the Siberian Railway for thirty-one days in December,\r\n1907, through a series of \"republics\" from Harbin to Petrograd. I thus\r\ngained a clear indication of what might be expected from a licentious\r\nmob of soldiers utterly devoid of restraining principles. All the\r\nmeetings, resolutions, soviets--in a word, all the manifestations of\r\na mutiny of the military--were repeated in 1917 with photographic\r\naccuracy, but with greater impetus and on a much larger scale.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the possibility of such a rapid psychological\r\ntransformation was not characteristic of the Russian Army alone. There\r\ncan be no doubt that war-weariness after three years of bloodshed\r\nplayed an important part in these events, as the armies of the whole\r\nworld were affected by it and were rendered more accessible to the\r\ndisintegrating influences of extreme Socialist doctrines. In the\r\nautumn of 1918 the German Army Corps that occupied the region of the\r\nDon and Little Russia were demoralised in one week, and they repeated\r\nto a certain extent the process which we had already lived through of\r\nmeetings, soviets, committees, of doing away with Commanding Officers,\r\nand in some units of the sale of military stores, horses and arms.\r\nIt was not till then that the Germans understood the tragedy of\r\nthe Russian officers. More than once our volunteers saw the German\r\nofficers, formerly so haughty and so frigid, weeping bitterly over\r\ntheir degradation.\r\n\r\n\"You have done the same to us; you have done it with your own hands,\"\r\nwe said.\r\n\r\n\"Not we; it was our Government,\" was their reply.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1918, as Commander-in-Chief of the Volunteer Army, I\r\nreceived an offer from a group of German officers to join our army as\r\nvolunteers in the ranks.\r\n\r\nThe collapse of the army cannot be explained away as the psychological\r\nresult of defeats and disasters. Even the victors experienced\r\ndisturbances in the army. There was a certain amount of disaffection\r\namong the French troops occupying, in the beginning of 1918, the\r\nregion of Odessa and Roumania, in the French fleet cruising in the\r\nBlack Sea, among the British troops in the region of Constantinople\r\nand Transcaucasia. The troops did not always obey the orders of their\r\nCommanding Officers. Rapid demobilisation and the arrival of fresh,\r\npartly volunteer elements, altered the situation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Grand Duke Nicholas distributes Crosses of St.\r\nGeorge.]\r\n\r\nWhat was the condition of the Russian Army at the outbreak of the\r\nRevolution? From time immemorial the entire ideology of our soldiers\r\nwas contained in the well-known formula: \"For God, for the Czar and\r\nfor the Mother Country.\" Generation after generation was born and bred\r\non that formula. These ideas, however, did not penetrate deeply enough\r\ninto the masses of the people and of the army. For many centuries\r\nthe Russian people had been deeply religious, but their faith was\r\nsomewhat shaken in the beginning of the Twentieth Century. The Russian\r\npeople, as the Russian saying goes, was \"the bearer of Christ\"--a\r\npeople inwardly disposed towards Universal Brotherhood, great in its\r\nsimplicity, truthfulness, humility and forgiveness. That people,\r\nChristian in the fullest sense of the word, was gradually changing as\r\nit came under the influence of material interests, and learnt or was\r\ntaught to see in the gratifying of those interests the sole purpose\r\nof life. The link between the people and its spiritual leaders was\r\ngradually weakening as these leaders were detached from the people,\r\nentered into the service of the Governing powers, and shared the\r\nlatter's deficiencies. The development of this moral transformation\r\nof the Russian people is too deep and too complex to fall within the\r\nscope of these memoirs. It is undeniable that the youngsters who\r\njoined the ranks treated questions of the Faith and of the Church with\r\nindifference. In barracks they lost the habits of their homes, and\r\nwere forcibly removed from a more wholesome and settled atmosphere,\r\nwith all its creeds and superstitions. They received no spiritual or\r\nmoral education, which in barracks was considered a matter of minor\r\nimportance, completely overshadowed by practical and material cares\r\nand requirements. A proper spirit could not be created in barracks,\r\nwhere Christian morals, religious discourses, and even the rites of\r\nthe Church bore an official and sometimes even compulsory character.\r\nCommanding Officers know how difficult it was to find a solution of the\r\nvexed question of attendance at Church services.\r\n\r\nWar introduced two new elements into the spiritual life of the army. On\r\nthe one hand, there was a certain moral coarseness and cruelty; on the\r\nother, it seemed as if faith had been deepened by constant danger. I do\r\nnot wish to accuse the orthodox military clergy as a body. Many of its\r\nrepresentatives proved their high valour, courage and self-sacrifice.\r\nIt must, however, be admitted that the clergy failed to produce a\r\nreligious revival among the troops. It is not their fault, because the\r\nworld-war into which Russia was drawn was due to intricate political\r\nand economic causes, and there was no room for religious fervour.\r\nThe clergy, however, likewise failed to establish closer connection\r\nwith the troops. After the outbreak of the Revolution the officers\r\ncontinued for a long time to struggle to keep their waning power and\r\nauthority, but the voice of the priests was silenced almost at once,\r\nand they ceased to play any part whatsoever in the life of the troops.\r\nI recall an episode typical of the mental attitude of military circles\r\nin those days. One of the regiments of the Fourth Rifle Division had\r\nbuilt a camp Church quite close to its lines, and had built it with\r\ngreat care and very artistically. The Revolution came. A demagogue\r\ncaptain decided that his company had inadequate quarters and that a\r\nChurch was a superstition. On his own authority he converted the Church\r\ninto quarters for his company, and dug a hole where the altar stood\r\nfor purposes which it is better not to mention. I am not surprised\r\nthat such a scoundrel was found in the regiment or that the Higher\r\nCommand was terrorised and silent. But why did two or three thousand\r\northodox Russians, bred in the mystic rites of their faith, remain\r\nindifferent to such a sacrilege? Be that as it may, there can hardly be\r\nany doubt that religion ceased to be one of the moral impulses which\r\nupheld the spirit of the Russian Army and prompted it to deeds of\r\nvalour or protected it later from the development of bestial instincts.\r\nThe orthodox clergy, generally speaking, was thrown overboard\r\nduring the storm. Some of the high dignitaries of the Church--the\r\nMetropolitans--Pitirim and Makarius--the Archbishop Varnava and others,\r\nunfortunately were closely connected with the Governing bureaucracy\r\nof the Rasputin period of Petrograd history. The lower grades of\r\nthe clergy, on the other hand, were in close touch with the Russian\r\nintellectuals.\r\n\r\nI cannot take it upon myself to judge of the extent to which the\r\nRussian Church remained an active force after it came under the yoke of\r\nthe Bolsheviks. An impenetrable veil hangs over the life of the Russian\r\nChurch in Soviet Russia, but there can be no doubt that spiritual\r\nrenaissance is progressing and spreading, that the martyrdom of\r\nhundreds, nay, thousands, of priests is waking the dormant conscience\r\nof the people and is becoming a legend in their minds.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CZAR.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to prove that the enormous majority of the\r\nCommanding Officers were thoroughly loyal to the Monarchist idea and\r\nto the Czar himself. The subsequent behaviour of the higher Commanding\r\nOfficers who had been Monarchists was due partly to motives of\r\nself-seeking, partly to pusillanimity and to the desire to conceal\r\ntheir real feelings in order to remain in power and to carry out their\r\nown plans. Cases in which a change of front was the result of the\r\ncollapse of ideals, of a new outlook, or was prompted by motives of\r\npractical statesmanship, were rare. For example, it would have been\r\nchildish to have believed General Brussilov when he asserted that from\r\nthe days of his youth he had been \"a Socialist and a Republican.\" He\r\nwas bred in the traditions of the Old Guards, was closely connected\r\nwith circles of the Court, and permeated with their outlook. His\r\nhabits, tastes, sympathies and surroundings were those of a _barin_.[1]\r\nNo man can be a lifelong liar to himself and to others. The majority\r\nof the officers of the Regular Russian Army had Monarchist principles\r\nand were undoubtedly loyal. After the Japanese war, as a result of the\r\nfirst Revolution, the Officers' Corps was, nevertheless, placed, for\r\nreasons which are not sufficiently clear, under the special supervision\r\nof the Police Department, and regimental Commanding Officers received\r\nfrom time to time \"black lists.\" The tragedy of it was that it was\r\nalmost useless to argue against the verdict of \"unreliability,\" while,\r\nat the same time, it was forbidden to conduct one's own investigation,\r\neven in secret. This system of spying introduced an unwholesome\r\nspirit into the army. Not content with this system, the War Minister,\r\nGeneral Sukhomlinov, introduced his own branch of counter-spies, which\r\nwas headed unofficially by Colonel Miassoyedov, who was afterwards\r\nshot as a German spy. At every military District Headquarters an\r\norgan was instituted, headed by an officer of the Gendarmerie\r\ndressed up in G.H.Q. uniform. Officially, he was supposed to deal\r\nwith foreign espionage, but General Dukhonin (who was killed by the\r\nBolsheviks), when Chief of the Intelligence Bureau of the Kiev G.H.Q.\r\nbefore the War, bitterly complained to me of the painful atmosphere\r\ncreated by this new organ, which was officially subordinate to the\r\nQuartermaster-General, but in reality looked on him with suspicion, and\r\nwas spying not only upon the Staff, but upon its own chiefs.\r\n\r\nLife itself seemed to induce the officers to utter some kind of protest\r\nagainst the existing order. Of all the classes that served the State,\r\nthere had been for a long time no element so downtrodden and forlorn\r\nor so ill-provided for as the officers of the Regular Russian Army.\r\nThey lived in abject poverty. Their rights and their self-esteem were\r\nconstantly ignored by the Senior Officers. The utmost the rank and\r\nfile could hope for as the crowning of their career was the rank of\r\nColonel and an old age spent in sickness and semi-starvation. From the\r\nmiddle of the nineteenth century the Officers' Corps had completely\r\nlost its character as a class and a caste. Since universal compulsory\r\nservice was introduced and the nobility ceased to be prosperous the\r\ngates of military schools were opened wide to people of low extraction\r\nand to young men belonging to the lower strata of the people, but with\r\na diploma from the civil schools. They formed a majority in the Army.\r\nMobilisations, on the other hand, reinforced the Officers' Corps by the\r\ninfusion of a great many men of the liberal professions, who introduced\r\nnew ideas and a new outlook. Finally, the tremendous losses suffered\r\nby the Regular Officers' Corps compelled the High Command to relax to\r\na certain extent the regulations concerning military training and\r\neducation, and to introduce on a broad scale promotions from the ranks\r\nfor deeds of valour, and to give rankers a short training in elementary\r\nschools to fit them to be temporary officers.\r\n\r\nThese circumstances, characteristic of all armies formed from the\r\nmasses, undoubtedly reduced the fighting capacity of the Officers'\r\nCorps, and brought about a certain change in its political outlook,\r\nbringing it nearer to that of the average Russian intellectual and to\r\ndemocracy. This the leaders of the Revolutionary democracy did not,\r\nor, to be more accurate, would not, understand in the first days of\r\nthe Revolution. In the course of my narrative I will differentiate\r\nbetween the \"Revolutionary Democracy\"--an agglomeration of socialist\r\nparties--and the true Russian Democracy, to which the middle-class\r\nintelligencia and the Civil Service elements undoubtedly belong.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the Regular Officers was, however, gradually changing.\r\nThe Japanese War, which disclosed the grave shortcomings of the country\r\nand of the Army, the Duma and the Press, which had gained a certain\r\nliberty after 1905, played an important part in the political education\r\nof the officers. The mystic adoration of the Monarch began gradually to\r\nvanish. Among the junior generals and other officers there appeared men\r\nin increasing numbers capable of differentiating between the idea of\r\nthe Monarchy and personalities, between the welfare of the country and\r\nthe form of government. In officer circles opportunities occurred for\r\ncriticism, analysis, and sometimes for severe condemnation.\r\n\r\nIt is to be wondered that in these circumstances our officers remained\r\nsteadfast and stoutly resisted the extremist, destructive currents of\r\npolitical thought. The percentage of men who reached the depths and\r\nwere unmasked by the authorities was insignificant. With regard to the\r\nthrone, generally speaking, there was a tendency among the officers to\r\nseparate the person of the Emperor from the miasma with which he was\r\nsurrounded, from the political errors and misdeeds of the Government,\r\nwhich was leading the country steadily to ruin and the Army to defeat.\r\nThey wanted to forgive the Emperor, and tried to make excuses for him.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the accepted view, the monarchical idea had no deep, mystic\r\nroots among the rank and file, and, of course, the semi-cultured masses\r\nentirely failed to realise the meaning of other forms of Government\r\npreached by Socialists of all shades of opinion. Owing to a certain\r\ninnate Conservatism, to habits dating from time immemorial, and to\r\nthe teaching of the Church, the existing régime was considered as\r\nsomething quite natural and inevitable. In the mind and in the heart\r\nof the soldier the idea of a monarch was, if I may so express it, \"in\r\na potential state,\" rising sometimes to a point of high exaltation\r\nwhen the monarch was personally approached (at reviews, parades and\r\ncasual meetings), and sometimes falling to indifference. At any rate,\r\nthe Army was in a disposition sufficiently favourable to the idea of\r\na monarchy and to the dynasty, and that disposition could have easily\r\nbeen maintained. But a sticky cobweb of licentiousness and crime was\r\nbeing woven at Petrograd and Czarskoe Selo. The truth, intermingled\r\nwith falsehood, penetrated into the remotest corners of the country\r\nand into the Army, and evoked painful regrets and sometimes malicious\r\nrejoicings. The members of the House of Romanov did not preserve the\r\n\"idea\" which the orthodox monarchists wished to surround with a halo of\r\ngreatness, nobility and reverence. I recall the impression of a sitting\r\nof the Duma which I happened to attend. For the first time, Gutchkov\r\nuttered a word of warning from the Tribune of the Duma about Rasputin.\r\n\r\n\"All is not well with our land.\"\r\n\r\nThe House, which had been rather noisy, was silent, and every word,\r\nspoken in a low voice, was distinctly audible in remote corners. A\r\nmysterious cloud, pregnant with catastrophe, seemed to hang over the\r\nnormal course of Russian history. I will not dwell on the corrupt\r\ninfluences prevailing in Ministerial dwellings and Imperial palaces\r\nto which the filthy and cynical impostor found access, who swayed\r\nministers and rulers.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Duke Nicholas is supposed to have threatened to hang\r\nRasputin should he venture to appear at G.H.Q. General Alexeiev also\r\ndisapproved strongly of the man. That the influence of Rasputin did\r\nnot spread to the old Army is due entirely to the attitude of the\r\nabove-named generals. All sorts of stories about Rasputin's influence\r\nwas circulated at the front, and the Censor collected an enormous\r\namount of material on the subject, even from soldiers' letters from the\r\nfront; but the gravest impression was produced by the word \"TREASON\"\r\nwith reference to the Empress. In the Army, openly and everywhere,\r\nconversations were heard about the Empress' persistent demands for a\r\nseparate peace and of her treachery towards Lord Kitchener, of whose\r\njourney she was supposed to have informed the Germans. As I recall the\r\npast, and the impression produced in the Army by the _rumour_ of the\r\nEmpress' treason, I consider that this circumstance had a very great\r\ninfluence upon the attitude of the Army towards the dynasty and the\r\nrevolution. In the spring of 1917 I questioned General Alexeiev on\r\nthis painful subject. His answer, reluctantly given, was vague. He\r\nsaid: \"When the Empress' papers were examined she was found to be in\r\npossession of a map indicating in detail the disposition of the troops\r\nalong the entire front. Only two copies were prepared of this map, one\r\nfor the Emperor and one for myself. I was very painfully impressed. God\r\nknows who may have made use of this map.\"\r\n\r\nHistory will undoubtedly throw light on the fateful influence exercised\r\nby the Empress Alexandra upon the Russian Government in the period\r\npreceding the Revolution. As regards the question of treason, this\r\ndisastrous rumour has not been confirmed by a single fact, and was\r\nafterwards contradicted by the investigations of a Commission specially\r\nappointed by the Provisional Government, on which representatives of\r\nthe Soviet of workmen and soldiers served.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the third foundation--the _Mother Country_. Deafened\r\nas we were, alas! by the thunder and rattle of conventional patriotic\r\nphrases, endlessly repeated along the whole length and breadth of\r\nRussia, we failed to detect the fundamental, innate defect of the\r\nRussian people--its lack of patriotism. It is no longer necessary to\r\nforce an open door by proving this statement. The Brest-Litovsk Treaty\r\nprovoked no outburst of popular wrath. Russian society was indifferent\r\nto the separation of the Border States, even those that were Russian\r\nin spirit and in blood. What is more, Russian society approved of this\r\ndismemberment. We know of the agreement between Poland and Petlura,\r\nbetween Poland and the Soviet. We know that Russian territorial and\r\nmaterial riches were sold for a song to international, political\r\nusurers. Need we adduce further proofs?\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the collapse of Russian Statehood as\r\nmanifested in \"self-determination\" was in several instances caused by\r\nthe desire to find a temporary safeguard against the Bedlam of the\r\nSoviet Republic. Life, however, unfortunately does not stop at the\r\npractical application of this peculiar \"sanitary cordon,\" but strikes\r\nat the very idea of Statehood. This occurred even in such stable\r\ndistricts as the Cossack provinces, not, however, among the masses,\r\nbut among the leaders themselves. Thus at Ekaterinodar in 1920, at the\r\n\"High Krug\" (Assembly) of the three Cossack armies, the mention of\r\nRussia was omitted after a heated discussion from the proposed formula\r\nof the oath....\r\n\r\nIs Crucified Russia unworthy of our love?\r\n\r\nWhat, then, was the effect of the Mother Country idea upon the\r\nconscience of the old Army? The upper strata of the Russian\r\nintellectuals were well aware of the reasons for the world\r\nconflagration, of the conflict of the Powers for political and\r\neconomic supremacy, for free routes, for markets and colonies--a\r\nconflict in which Russia's part was merely one of self-defence. On\r\nthe other hand, the average number of the Russian _intelligencia_,\r\nas well as officers, were often satisfied merely with the immediate\r\nand more obvious and easily comprehensible causes. Nobody wanted the\r\nwar, except, perhaps, the impressionable young officers yearning for\r\nexploits. It was believed that the powers-that-be would take every\r\nprecaution in order to avoid a rupture. Gradually, however, the fatal\r\ninevitability of war was understood. There was no question on our part\r\nof aggressiveness or self-interest. To sympathise sincerely with the\r\nweak and the oppressed was in keeping with the traditional attitude of\r\nRussia. Also, we did not draw the sword--the sword was drawn against\r\nus. That is why, when the war began, the voices were silenced of those\r\nwho feared that, owing to the low level of her culture and economic\r\ndevelopment, Russia would be unable to win in the contest with a strong\r\nand cultured enemy. War was accepted in a patriotic spirit, which was\r\nat times akin to enthusiasm. Like the majority of the intellectuals,\r\nthe officers did not take much interest in the question of war aims.\r\nThe war began; defeat would have led to immeasurable disaster to\r\nour country in every sphere of its life, to territorial losses,\r\npolitical decadence and economic slavery. Victory was, therefore,\r\na necessity. All other questions were relegated to the background.\r\nThere was plenty of time for their discussion, for new decisions and\r\nfor changes. This simplified attitude towards the war, coupled with\r\na profound understanding and with a national self-consciousness, was\r\nnot understood by the left wing of the Russian politicians, who were\r\ndriven to Zimmerwald and Kienthal. No wonder, therefore, that when\r\nthe anonymous and the Russian leaders of the Revolutionary democracy\r\nwere confronted in February, 1917, before the Army was deliberately\r\ndestroyed, with the dilemma: \"Are we to save the country or the\r\nRevolution?\" they chose the latter.\r\n\r\nStill less did the illiterate masses of the people understand the idea\r\nof national self-preservation. The people went to war submissively,\r\nbut without enthusiasm and without any clear perception of the\r\nnecessity for a great sacrifice. Their psychology did not rise to the\r\nunderstanding of abstract national principles. \"The people-in-arms,\"\r\nfor that was what the Army really was, were elated by victory and\r\ndownhearted when defeated. They did not fully understand the necessity\r\nfor crossing the Carpathians, and had, perhaps, a clearer idea of\r\nthe meaning of the struggle on the Styr and the Pripet. And yet it\r\nfound solace in the thought: \"We are from Tambov; the Germans will\r\nnot reach us.\" It is necessary to repeat this stale saying, because\r\nit expresses the deep-rooted psychology of the average Russian. As a\r\nresult of this predominance of material interests in the outlook of\r\n\"the people-in-arms,\" they grasped more easily the simple arguments\r\nbased on realities in favour of a stubborn fight and of victory, as\r\nwell as the impossibility of admitting defeat. These arguments were:\r\nA foreign German domination, the ruin of the country and of the home,\r\nthe weight of the taxes which would inevitably be levied after defeat,\r\nthe fall in the price of grain, which would have to go through foreign\r\nchannels, etc. In addition, there was some feeling of confidence that\r\nthe Government was doing the right thing, the more so as the nearest\r\nrepresentatives of that power, the officers, were going forward\r\nwith the troops and were dying in the same spirit of readiness and\r\nsubmission as the men, either because they had been ordered to do\r\nso, or else because they thought it their duty. The rank and file,\r\ntherefore, bravely faced death. Afterwards when confidence was shaken,\r\nthe masses of the Army were completely perplexed. The formulas,\r\n\"without annexations and indemnities,\" \"the self-determination of\r\npeoples,\" etc., proved more abstract and less intelligible than the\r\nold repudiated and rusty idea of the Mother Country, which still\r\npersisted underneath them. In order to keep the men at the front, the\r\nwell-known arguments of a materialistic nature, such as the threat of\r\nGerman domination, the ruin of the home, the weight of taxes, were\r\nexpounded from platforms decorated with red flags. They were taught by\r\nSocialists, who favoured a war of defence.\r\n\r\nThus the three principles which formed the foundations of the Army were\r\nundermined. In describing the anomalies and spiritual shortcomings\r\nof the Russian Army, far be it from me to place it below the level\r\nof armies of other countries. These shortcomings are inherent in all\r\narmies formed from the masses, which are almost akin to a militia, but\r\nthis did not prevent these armies or our own from gaining victories\r\nand continuing the war. It is necessary, however, to draw a complete\r\npicture of the spirit of the Army in order to understand its subsequent\r\ndestiny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE ARMY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Russo-Japanese war had a very great influence upon the\r\ndevelopment of the Russian army. The bitterness of defeat and the\r\nclear consciousness that the policy governing military affairs was\r\ndisastrously out of date gave a great impulse to the junior military\r\nelements and forced the slack and inert elements gradually to alter\r\ntheir ways or else to retire. In spite of the passive resistance of\r\nseveral men at the head of the War Ministry and the General Staff, who\r\nwere either incompetent or else treated the interests of the army with\r\nlevity and indifference, work was done at full speed. In ten years the\r\nRussian army, without of course attaining the ideal, made tremendous\r\nprogress. It may be confidently asserted that, had it not been for the\r\nhard lessons of the Manchurian campaign, Russia would have been crushed\r\nin the first months of the Great War.\r\n\r\nYet the cleansing of the commanding personnel went too slowly. Our\r\nsoftness (\"Poor devil! we must give him a job\"), wire-pulling,\r\nintrigues, and too slavish an observance of the rules of seniority\r\nresulted in the ranks of senior commanding officers being crowded with\r\nworthless men. The High Commission for granting testimonials, which\r\nsat twice a year in Petrograd, hardly knew any of those to whom these\r\ntestimonials were given. Therein lies the reason for the mistakes made\r\nat the outbreak of war in many appointments to High Commands. Four\r\nCommanders-in-Chief (one of them suffered from mental paralysis--it is\r\ntrue that his appointment was only temporary), several Army Commanders,\r\nmany Army Corps and Divisional Commanders had to be dismissed. In the\r\nvery first days of the concentration of the Eighth Army, in July,\r\n1914, General Brussilov dismissed three Divisional and one Army Corps\r\nCommanders. Yet nonentities retained their commands, and they ruined\r\nthe troops and the operations. Under the same General Brussilov,\r\nGeneral D., relieved several times of his command, went from a cavalry\r\ndivision to three infantry divisions in turn, and found final repose\r\nin German captivity. Most unfortunately, the whole army was aware of\r\nthe incompetence of these Commanding Officers, and wondered at their\r\nappointments. Owing to these deficiencies, the strategy of the entire\r\ncampaign lacked inspiration and boldness. Such, for example, were\r\nthe operations of the North-Western front in East Prussia, prompted\r\nsolely by the desire of G.H.Q. to save the French Army from a desperate\r\nposition. Such, in particular, was Rennenkampf's shameful manoeuvre,\r\nas well as the stubborn forcing of the Carpathians, which dismembered\r\nthe troops of the South-Western front in 1915, and finally our advance\r\nin the spring of 1916.\r\n\r\nThe last episode was so typical of the methods of our High Command and\r\nits consequences were so grave that it is worth our while to recall it.\r\n\r\nWhen the armies of the South-Western front took the offensive in May,\r\nthe attack was eminently successful and several Austrian divisions\r\nwere heavily defeated. When my division, after the capture of Lutsk,\r\nwas moving by forced marches to Vladimir Volynsk, I considered--and\r\nwe all considered--that our manoeuvre represented the entire scheme\r\nof the advance, that our front was dealing the main blow. We learnt\r\nafterwards that the task of dealing the main blow had been entrusted\r\nto the Western front, and that Brussilov's armies were only making a\r\ndemonstration. There, towards Vilna, large forces had been gathered,\r\nequipped with artillery and technical means such as we had never had\r\nbefore. For several months the troops had been preparing _places\r\nd'armes_ for the advance. At last all was ready, and the success of the\r\nSouthern armies that diverted the enemy's attention and his reserves\r\nalso promised success to the Western front.\r\n\r\nAlmost on the eve of the contemplated offensive the historical\r\nconversation took place on the telephone between General Evert,\r\nC.-in-C. of the Western front, and General Alexeiev, Chief of Staff of\r\nthe Supreme Commander-in-Chief. The gist of the conversation was the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n_A._ Circumstances require an immediate decision. Are you ready for the\r\nadvance and are you certain to be successful?\r\n\r\n_E._ I have no certainty of success. The enemy's positions are very\r\nstrong. Our troops will have to attack the positions against which\r\ntheir previous attacks have failed.\r\n\r\n_A._ If that is the case, you must give immediate orders for the\r\ntransfer of troops to the South-Western front. I will report to the\r\nEmperor.\r\n\r\nSo the operation, so long awaited and so methodically prepared,\r\ncollapsed. The Western Army Corps, sent to reinforce us, came too late.\r\nOur advance was checked. The senseless slaughter on the swampy banks\r\nof the Stokhod then began. Incidentally, the Guards lost the flower\r\nof their men in those battles. Meanwhile, the German Eastern front\r\nwas going through a period of intense anxiety. \"It was a critical\r\ntime,\" says Ludendorff in his _Mes Souvenirs de Guerre_. \"We had\r\nspent ourselves, and we knew full well that no one would come to our\r\nassistance if the Russians chose to attack us.\"\r\n\r\nAn episode may be mentioned in this connection, which occurred to\r\nGeneral Brussilov. The story is not widely known, and may serve as\r\nan interesting sidelight on the character of the General--one of the\r\nleaders of the campaign. After the brilliant operations of the Eighth\r\nArmy, which ended in the crossing of the Carpathians and the invasion\r\nof Hungary, the C.-in-C., General Brussilov, suffered a curious\r\npsychological breakdown. Under the impression that a partial reverse\r\nhad been sustained by one of the Army Corps, he issued an order for\r\na general retreat, and the Army began rapidly to roll back. He was\r\nhaunted by imaginary dangers of the enemy breaking through, surrounding\r\nour troops, of attacks of enemy cavalry which were supposed to threaten\r\nthe G.H.Q. Twice General Brussilov moved his H.Q. with a swiftness akin\r\nto a panicky flight. The C.-in-C. was thus detached from his armies and\r\nout of touch with them.\r\n\r\nWe were retreating day after day in long, weary marches, and utterly\r\nbewildered. The Austrians did not outnumber us, and their moral was no\r\nhigher than ours. They did not press us. Every day, my riflemen and\r\nKornilov's troops in our vicinity delivered short counter-attacks, took\r\nmany prisoners, and captured machine-guns.\r\n\r\nThe Quartermaster-General's branch of the Army was even more puzzled.\r\nEvery day it reported that the news of the retreat was unfounded;\r\nbut Brussilov at first disregarded these reports, and later became\r\ngreatly incensed. The General Staff then had recourse to another\r\nstratagem: they approached Brussilov's old friend, the veteran General\r\nPanchulidzev, Chief of the Army Sanitation Branch, and persuaded him\r\nthat, if this retreat continued, the Army might suspect treason and\r\nthings might take an ugly turn. Panchulidzev visited Brussilov. An\r\nintensely painful scene took place. As a result, Brussilov was found\r\nweeping bitterly and Panchulidzev fainted. On the same day, an order\r\nwas issued for an advance, and the troops went forward rapidly and\r\neasily, driving the Austrians before them. The strategical position was\r\nrestored as well as the reputation of the Army Commander.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that not only the troops but the Commanders were\r\nbut scantily informed of the happenings of the front, and had hazy\r\nideas on the general strategical scheme. The troops criticised them\r\nonly when it was obvious that they had to pay the price of blood for\r\nthese schemes. So it was in the Carpathians, at Stokhod, during the\r\nsecond attack on Przemyshl in the spring of 1917, etc. The moral of\r\nthe troops was affected chiefly by the great Galician retreat, the\r\nunhappy progress of the war on the Northern and Western fronts--where\r\nno victories were won--and by the tedious lingering for over a year in\r\npositions of which everyone was sick to death.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned the cadres of commissioned officers. The great\r\nand small shortcomings of these cadres increased as the cadres became\r\nseparated. No one expected the campaign to be protracted, and the Army\r\norganisation was not careful to preserve the cadres of officers and\r\nnon-commissioned officers. They were drafted wholesale into the ranks\r\nat the outbreak of war. I remember so well a conversation that took\r\nplace during the period of mobilisation, which was then contemplated\r\nagainst Austria alone. It occurred in the flat of General V. M.\r\nDragomirov, one of the prominent leaders of the Army. A telegram was\r\nbrought in announcing that Germany had declared war. There was a dead\r\nsilence. Everyone was deep in thought. Somebody asked Dragomirov:\r\n\r\n\"How long do you think the war will last?\"\r\n\r\n\"Four months.\"\r\n\r\nCompanies went to the front sometimes with five to six officers.\r\nRegular officers, and later the majority of other officers, invariably\r\nand in all circumstances gave the example of prowess, pluck and\r\nself-sacrifice. It is only natural that most of them were killed.\r\nAnother reliable element--the N.C.O.'s of the Reserve--was also\r\nrecklessly squandered. In the beginning of the war they formed\r\nsometimes 50 per cent. of the rank and file. Relations between officers\r\nand men in the old army were not always based upon healthy principles.\r\nIt cannot be denied that there was a certain aloofness caused by\r\nthe insufficient attention paid by the officers to the spiritual\r\nrequirements of the soldier's life. These relations, however, gradually\r\nimproved as the barriers of caste and class were broken down. The war\r\ndrew officers and men ever closer together, and in some regiments,\r\nmostly of the line, there was a true brotherhood in arms. One\r\nreservation must here be made. The outward intercourse bore the stamp\r\nof the general lack of culture from which not only the masses but also\r\nthe Russian intellectuals suffered. Heartfelt solicitude, touching care\r\nof the men's needs, simplicity and friendliness--all these qualities\r\nof the Russian officer, who lay for months on end in the wet, dirty\r\ntrenches beside their men, ate out of the same pot, died quietly and\r\nwithout a murmur, was buried in the same \"fraternal grave\"--were marred\r\nby an occasional roughness, swearing, and sometimes by arbitrariness\r\nand blows.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the same conditions existed within the\r\nranks, and the only difference was that the sergeant and the corporal\r\nwere rougher and more cruel than the officers. These deplorable\r\ncircumstances coupled with the boredom and stupidity of barrack life,\r\nand the petty restrictions imposed upon the men by the military\r\nregulations, gave ample scope for underground seditious propaganda in\r\nwhich the soldier was described as the \"victim of the arbitrariness\r\nof the men with golden epaulettes.\" The sound feeling and naturally\r\nhealthy outlook of the men was not mentioned while the discomforts\r\nof military life were insisted on in order to foster a spirit of\r\ndiscontent.\r\n\r\nThis state of affairs was all the more serious because during the\r\nwar the process of consolidating the different units became more and\r\nmore difficult. These units, and especially the infantry regiments,\r\nsuffering terrible losses and changing their personnel ten or twelve\r\ntimes, became to some extent recruiting stations through which men\r\nflowed in an uninterrupted stream. They remained there but a short\r\ntime, and failed to become imbued with the military traditions of\r\ntheir unit. The artillery and some other special branches remained\r\ncomparatively solid, and this was due in some measure to the fact\r\nthat their losses were, as compared with the losses suffered by the\r\ninfantry, only in the proportion of one to ten or one to twenty.\r\n\r\nOn the whole the atmosphere in the Army and in the Navy was not,\r\ntherefore, particularly wholesome. In varying degrees, the two elements\r\nof the Army--the rank and file and the commanding cadres--were divided.\r\nFor this the Russian officers, as well as the intellectuals, were\r\nundoubtedly responsible. Their misdeeds resulted in the idea gaining\r\nground that the _barin_ (master) and the officer were opposed to the\r\n_moujik_ and the soldier. A favourable atmosphere was thus created for\r\nthe work of destructive forces.\r\n\r\nAnarchist elements were by no means predominant in the Army. The\r\nfoundations, though somewhat unstable, had to be completely shattered;\r\nthe new power had to commit a long series of mistakes and crimes to\r\nconvert the state of smouldering discontent into active rebellion,\r\nthe bloody spectre of which will for some time to come hang over our\r\nhapless Russian land.\r\n\r\nDestructive outside influences were not counteracted in the Army by a\r\nreasonable process of education. This was due partly to the political\r\nunpreparedness of the officers, partly to the instinctive fear felt\r\nby the old régime of introducing \"politics\" into barracks, even with\r\na view to criticising subversive doctrines. This fear was felt not\r\nonly in respect of social and internal problems but even in respect\r\nof foreign policy. Thus, for example, an Imperial order was issued\r\nshortly before the war, strictly prohibiting any discussion amongst\r\nthe soldiers on the subject of the political issues of the moment (the\r\nBalkan question, the Austro-Serbian conflict, etc.). On the eve of the\r\ninevitable national war, the authorities persistently refrained from\r\nawakening wholesome patriotism by explaining the causes and aims of\r\nthe war, and instructing the rank and file on the Slav question and\r\nour long-drawn struggle against Germanism. I must confess that, like\r\nmany others, I did not carry out that order, and that I endeavoured\r\nproperly to influence the moral of the Archangel regiment which I then\r\ncommanded. I published an impassioned article against the order in the\r\nMilitary Press, under the title _Do not quench the spirit_. I feel\r\ncertain that the statue of Strassbourg in the Place de la Concorde in\r\nParis, draped in a black veil, played an important part in fostering\r\nthe heroic spirit of the French Army.\r\n\r\nPropaganda penetrated into the old Russian Armies from all sides.\r\nThere can be no doubt that the fitful attempts of the ever-changing\r\ngovernments of Goremykin, Sturmer, Trepov, etc., to arrest the normal\r\ncourse of life in Russia, provided ample material for propaganda and\r\nroused the anger of the people, which was reflected in the Army.\r\nSocialist and defeatist writers took advantage of this state of\r\naffairs. Lenin first contrived to introduce his doctrines into Russia\r\nthrough the Social Democratic party of the Duma. The Germans worked\r\nwith even greater intensity.\r\n\r\nIt should, however, be noted that all this propaganda from outside and\r\nfrom within affected chiefly the units of the rear, the garrisons and\r\nreserve battalions of the main centres, and especially of Petrograd,\r\nand that, before the Revolution, its influence at the front was\r\ncomparatively insignificant. Reinforcements reached the front in a\r\nstate of perplexity, but under the influence of a saner atmosphere,\r\nand of healthier, albeit more arduous, conditions of warfare, they\r\nrapidly improved. The effect of destructive propaganda was, however,\r\nnoticeable in certain units where the ground was favourable, and two\r\nor three cases of insubordination of entire units occurred before the\r\nRevolution, and were severely repressed. Finally, the bulk of the\r\nArmy--the peasantry--was confronted with one practical question which\r\n_prompted them instinctively to delay the social revolution_: \"THE LAND\r\nWOULD BE DIVIDED IN OUR ABSENCE. WHEN WE RETURN WE SHALL DIVIDE IT.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe inadequate organisation of the rear, the orgy of theft, high\r\nprices, profiteering and luxury, for which the front paid in blood,\r\nnaturally afforded material for propaganda. The Army, however, suffered\r\nmost heavily from the lack of technical means, especially of ammunition.\r\n\r\nIt was only in 1917 that General Sukhomlinov's trial disclosed to the\r\nRussian Army and to public opinion the main causes of the military\r\ncatastrophe of 1915. Plans for replenishing the Russian Army stores had\r\nbeen completed, and credits for that purpose assigned as early as in\r\n1907. Curiously enough, these credits were increased on the initiative\r\nof the Commission for National Defence, not of the Ministry of War.\r\nAs a rule, neither the Duma nor the Ministry of Finance ever refused\r\nwar credits or reduced them. During Sukhomlinov's tenure of office\r\nthe War Ministry obtained a special credit of 450 million roubles, of\r\nwhich less than 300 millions were spent. Before the war, the question\r\nof providing the Army with munitions after the peace-time stores\r\nwere exhausted was never even raised. It is true that the intensity\r\nof firing reached, from the very outbreak of war, unexpected and\r\nunheard-of proportions, which upset all the theoretical calculations of\r\nmilitary specialists in Russia and abroad. Naturally, heroic measures\r\nwere necessary in order to deal with this tragic situation.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the supplies of ammunition for the reinforcements that\r\ncame to the front--at first only 1/10th equipped, and later without\r\nany rifles at all--were exhausted as early as in October, 1914. The\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the South-Western front telegraphed to G.H.Q.:\r\n\"The machinery for providing ammunition has completely broken down.\r\nIn the absence of fresh supplies, we shall have to cease fighting, or\r\nelse send troops to the front in an extremely precarious condition.\" At\r\nthe same time (the end of September) Marshal Joffre inquired \"whether\r\nthe Imperial Russian Army was adequately supplied with shells for the\r\nuninterrupted conduct of war.\" The War Minister, General Sukhomlinov,\r\nreplied: \"The present condition of the Russian Army in respect of\r\nammunition gives no ground for serious apprehension.\" Orders were not\r\nplaced abroad, and Japanese and American rifles were refused \"in order\r\nto avoid the inconvenience due to different calibres.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the man who was responsible for the military catastrophe faced his\r\njudges in August, 1917, his personality produced a pitiful impression.\r\nThe trial raised a more serious, painful question: \"How could this\r\nirresponsible man, with no real knowledge of military matters, and\r\nperhaps even consciously a criminal, have remained in power for six\r\nyears?\" How \"shamelessly indifferent to good and evil,\" according\r\nto Pushkin's saying, the military bureaucracy must have been, that\r\nsurrounded him and tolerated the sins of omission and commission, which\r\ninvariably and systematically injured the interests of the State.\r\n\r\nThe final catastrophe came in 1915.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget the spring of 1915, the great tragedy of the\r\nRussian Army---the Galician retreat. We had neither cartridges nor\r\nshells. From day to day, we fought heavy battles and did lengthy\r\nmarches. We were desperately tired--physically and morally. From hazy\r\nhopes we plunged into the depths of gloom. I recall an action near\r\nPrzemyshl in the middle of May. The Fourth Rifle Division fought\r\nfiercely for eleven days. For eleven days the German heavy guns were\r\nroaring, and they literally blew up rows of trenches, with all their\r\ndefenders. We scarcely replied at all--we had nothing to reply with.\r\nUtterly exhausted regiments were beating off one attack after another\r\nwith bayonets, or firing at a close range. Blood was flowing, the ranks\r\nwere being thinned, and graveyards growing. Two regiments were almost\r\nentirely annihilated by firing.\r\n\r\nI would that our French and British friends, whose technical\r\nachievement is so wondrous, could note the following grotesque fact,\r\nwhich belongs to Russian history:\r\n\r\nOur only six-inch battery had been silent for three days. When it\r\nreceived FIFTY SHELLS the fact was immediately telephoned to all\r\nregiments and companies, and all the riflemen heaved a sigh of relief\r\nand joy.\r\n\r\nWhat painful, insulting irony there was in Brussilov's circular, in\r\nwhich the C.-in-C., incapable of providing us with ammunition, and with\r\na view to raising our spirits and our moral, advised us not to lay too\r\nmuch stress upon the German superiority in heavy guns, because there\r\nhad been many cases of the Germans inflicting but small losses in our\r\nranks by spending an enormous amount of shells....\r\n\r\nOn May 21st, General Yanushkevitch (Chief of the Staff of the Supreme\r\nC.-in-C., the Grand Duke Nicholas Nicholaievitch) telegraphed to\r\nthe War Minister: \"The evacuation of Przemyshl is an accomplished\r\nfact. Brussilov alleges a shortage of ammunition, that _bête noire_,\r\nyours and mine ... a loud cry comes from all the armies: 'Give us\r\ncartridges.'\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI am not inclined to idealise our Army. I have to speak many sad\r\ntruths about it. But when the Pharisees--the leaders of the Russian\r\nRevolutionary Democracy--endeavour to explain away the collapse of the\r\nArmy for which they are mainly responsible, by saying that the Army was\r\nalready on the verge of collapse, they are lying.\r\n\r\nI do not deny the grave shortcomings of our system of appointments to\r\nthe High Command, the errors of our strategy, tactics and organisation,\r\nthe technical backwardness of our Army, the defects of the Officers'\r\nCorps, the ignorance of the rank and file, and the vices of barrack\r\nlife. I know the extent of desertions and shirking, of which our\r\nintellectuals were hardly less guilty than the ignorant masses. The\r\nRevolutionary Democracy did not, however, devote special attention\r\nto _these_ serious defects of the Army. It could not remedy these\r\nevils, did not know how to cure them, and, in fact, did not combat\r\nthem at all. Speaking for myself, I do not know that the Revolutionary\r\nDemocracy has cured or even dealt seriously and effectively with\r\nany one of these evils. What of the famous \"Freedom from Bondage\"\r\nof the soldier? Discarding all the exaggerations which this term\r\nimplies, it may be said that the mere fact of the Revolution brought\r\nabout a certain change in the relations between the officers and\r\nthe men. In normal circumstances, and without coarse and malicious\r\noutside interference, this change might have become a source of great\r\nmoral strength, instead of a disaster. It was into this sore that\r\nthe Revolutionary Democracy poured poison. The very essence of the\r\nmilitary organisation: its eternal, unchangeable characteristics,\r\ndiscipline, individual authority, and the non-political spirit of the\r\nArmy, were ruthlessly assailed by the Revolutionary Democracy. These\r\ncharacteristics were lost. And yet it seemed as if the downfall of\r\nthe old régime opened new and immense possibilities for cleansing\r\nand uplifting the Russian people's Army and its Command morally and\r\ntechnically. Like people, like Army. After all, the old Russian Army,\r\nalbeit suffering from the deficiencies of the Russian people, had\r\nalso the people's virtues, and particularly an exceptional power\r\nof endurance in facing the horrors of war. The Army fought without\r\na murmur for nearly three years. With extraordinary prowess and\r\nself-sacrifice the men went into action with empty hands against the\r\ndeadly technique of the enemy. The rivers of blood shed by the rank\r\nand file atoned for the sins of the Supreme power, the Government, the\r\npeople, and of the Army itself.[2]\r\n\r\nOur late Allies should never forget that in the middle of January,\r\n1917, the Russian Army was holding on its front 187 enemy divisions,\r\nor 49 per cent. of the enemy's forces operating on the European and\r\nAsiatic fronts.\r\n\r\nThe old Russian Army was still strong enough to continue the war and to\r\nwin victories.\r\n\r\n[Diagram: Comparative forces of the Germans in different theatres\r\nof war]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE OLD ARMY AND THE EMPEROR.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn August, 1915, the Emperor, influenced by the entourage of the\r\nEmpress and of Rasputin, decided to take the Supreme Command of the\r\nArmy. Eight Cabinet Ministers and some politicians warned the Emperor\r\nagainst this dangerous step, but their pleadings were of no avail. The\r\nofficial motives they adduced were, on the one hand, the difficulty of\r\ncombining the tasks of governing the country and commanding the Army,\r\nand, on the other, the risk of assuming responsibility for the Army at\r\na time when it was suffering reverses and retreating. The real motive,\r\nhowever, was the fear lest the difficult position of the Army be\r\nfurther imperilled by the lack of knowledge and experience of the new\r\nSupreme C.-in-C., and that the German-Rasputin clique that surrounded\r\nhim, having already brought about the paralysis of the Government and\r\nits conflict with the Duma, would bring about the collapse of the Army.\r\n\r\nThere was a rumour, which was afterwards confirmed, that the Emperor\r\ncame to this decision partly because he feared the entourage of the\r\nEmpress, and partly because of the popularity of the Grand Duke\r\nNicholas, which was growing in spite of the reverses suffered by the\r\nArmy.\r\n\r\nOn August 23rd, an order was issued to the Army and Navy. To the\r\nofficial text, the Emperor added a note in his own hand, a facsimile of\r\nwhich is reproduced overleaf:\r\n\r\nThis decision, in spite of its intrinsic importance, produced no strong\r\nimpression upon the Army. The High Commanding Officers and the lower\r\ngrades of Commissioned Officers were well aware that the Emperor's\r\npersonal part in the Supreme Command would be purely nominal, and the\r\nquestion in everyone's mind was:\r\n\r\n\"Who will be the Chief of Staff?\"\r\n\r\nThe appointment of General Alexeiev appeased the anxiety of the\r\nofficers. The rank and file cared but little for the technical side\r\nof the Command. To them, the Czar had always been the Supreme Leader\r\nof the Army. One thing, however, somewhat perturbed them: the belief\r\nhad gained ground among the people years before that the Emperor was\r\nunlucky.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Note added by the Emperor to Army and Navy order\r\n\r\n    _Translation_:--\"With firm faith in the grace of God, and with\r\n    unshaken assurance of final victory, let us fulfil our sacred duty\r\n    of defending Russia till the end, and let us not bring shame to the\r\n    Russian land.--NICHOLAS.\"]\r\n\r\nIn reality, it was General M. V. Alexeiev who took command of the\r\narmed forces of Russia. In the history of the Russian war and the\r\nRussian turmoil, General Alexeiev holds so prominent a place that his\r\nimportance cannot be gauged in a few lines. A special historical study\r\nwould be necessary in order to describe the career of a man whose\r\nmilitary and political activities, which some have severely criticised\r\nand others extolled, never caused anyone to doubt that (in the words\r\nof an Army Order to the Volunteer Army) \"his path of martyrdom was\r\nlighted by crystalline honesty and by a fervent love for his Mother\r\nCountry--whether great or downtrodden.\"\r\n\r\nAlexeiev sometimes did not display sufficient firmness in enforcing\r\nhis demands, but, in respect of the independence of the \"Stavka\"\r\n(G.H.Q.) from outside influences, he showed civic courage which\r\nthe High Officials of the old régime, who clung to their offices,\r\ncompletely lacked.\r\n\r\nOne day, after an official dinner at Mohilev, the Empress took\r\nAlexeiev's arm, and went for a walk in the garden with him. She\r\nmentioned Rasputin. In terms of deep emotion she tried to persuade the\r\nGeneral that he was wrong in his attitude towards Rasputin, that \"the\r\nold man is a wonderful saint,\" that he was much calumniated, that he\r\nwas deeply devoted to the Imperial family, and, last but not least,\r\nthat his visit would bring luck to the \"Stavka.\"\r\n\r\nAlexeiev answered dryly that, so far as he was concerned, the question\r\nhad long since been settled. Should Rasputin appear at G.H.Q., he would\r\nimmediately resign his post.\r\n\r\n\"Is this your last word?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, certainly.\"\r\n\r\nThe Empress cut the conversation short, and left without saying\r\ngood-bye to the General, who afterwards admitted that the incident had\r\nan ill-effect upon the Emperor's attitude towards him. Contrary to the\r\nestablished opinion, the relations between the Emperor and Alexeiev,\r\noutwardly perfect, were by no means intimate or friendly, or even\r\nparticularly confidential. The Emperor loved no one except his son.\r\nTherein lies the tragedy of his life as a man and as a ruler.\r\n\r\nSeveral times General Alexeiev, depressed by the growth of popular\r\ndiscontent with the regime and the Crown, endeavoured to exceed the\r\nlimits of a military report and to represent to the Emperor the\r\nstate of affairs in its true light. He referred to Rasputin and to\r\nthe question of a responsible Ministry. He invariably met with the\r\nimpenetrable glance, so well-known to many, and the dry retort:\r\n\r\n\"I know.\"\r\n\r\nNot another word.\r\n\r\nIn matters of Army administration, the Emperor fully trusted Alexeiev,\r\nand listened attentively to the General's long, and perhaps even too\r\nelaborate, reports. Attentively and patiently he listened, but these\r\nmatters did not seem to appeal to him. There were differences of\r\nopinion in regard to minor matters, appointments to G.H.Q., new posts,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nNo doubt was left in my mind as to the Emperor's complete indifference\r\nin matters of high strategy after I read an important record--that\r\nof the deliberations of a Military Council held at G.H.Q. at\r\nthe end of 1916, under the chairmanship of the Emperor. All the\r\nCommanders-in-Chief and the high officials of G.H.Q. were present, and\r\nthe plans of the 1917 campaign and of a general advance were discussed.\r\n\r\nEvery word uttered at the conference was placed on record. One could\r\nnot fail to be impressed by the dominating and guiding part played by\r\nGeneral Gourko--Chief of the General Staff _pro tem._--by the somewhat\r\nselfish designs of various Commanders-in-Chief, who were trying to\r\nadapt strategical axioms to the special interests of their fronts, and\r\nfinally by the total indifference of the Supreme C.-in-C.\r\n\r\nRelations similar to those just described continued between the Emperor\r\nand the Chief of Staff when General Gourko took charge of that office\r\nwhile Alexeiev, who had fallen seriously ill in the autumn of 1916, was\r\nundergoing a cure at Sevastopol, without, however, losing touch with\r\nG.H.Q., with which he communicated by direct wire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the struggle between the progressive block of the Duma and\r\nthe Government (General Alexeiev and the majority of the Commanding\r\nOfficers undoubtedly sympathised with the former) was gradually\r\nbecoming more and more acute. The record of the sitting of the Duma\r\nof November 1st, 1916 (of which the publication was prohibited and an\r\nabridged version did not appear in the Press till the beginning of\r\nJanuary, 1917), when Shulgin and Miliukov delivered their historical\r\nspeeches, was circulated everywhere in the Army in the shape of\r\ntypewritten leaflets. Feeling was already running so high that these\r\nleaflets were not concealed, but were read and provoked animated\r\ndiscussions in officers' messes. A prominent Socialist, an active\r\nworker of the Union of Towns, who paid his first visit to the Army\r\nin 1916, said to me: \"I am amazed at the freedom with which the\r\nworthlessness of the Government and the Court scandals are being\r\ndiscussed in regiments and messes in the presence of Commanding\r\nofficers, at Army Headquarters, etc., and that in our country of\r\narbitrary repression ... at first it seemed to me that I was dealing\r\nwith 'agents provocateurs.'\"\r\n\r\nThe Duma had been in close connection with the Officers' Corps for\r\na long time. Young officers unofficially partook in the work of the\r\nCommission of National Defence during the period of the reorganisation\r\nof the Army and revival of the Fleet after the Japanese War. Gutchkov\r\nhad formed a circle, in which Savitch, Krupensky, Count Bobrinski\r\nand representatives of the officers, headed by General Gourko, were\r\nincluded. Apparently, General Polivanov (who afterwards played\r\nsuch an important part in contributing to the disintegration of the\r\nArmy, as Chairman of the \"Polivanov Commission\") also belonged to\r\nthe circle. There was no wish to \"undermine the foundations,\" but\r\nmerely to push along the heavy, bureaucratic van, to give impetus\r\nto the work, and initiative to the offices of the inert Military\r\nAdministration. According to Gutchkov, the circle worked quite openly,\r\nand the War Ministry at first even provided the members with materials.\r\nSubsequently, however, General Sukhomlinov's attitude changed abruptly,\r\nthe circle came under suspicion, and people began to call it \"The Young\r\nTurks.\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission of National Defence was, nevertheless, very well\r\ninformed. General Lukomski, who was Chief of the Mobilisation Section,\r\nand later Assistant War Minister, told me that reports to the\r\nCommission had to be prepared extremely carefully, and that General\r\nSukhomlinov, trivial and ignorant, produced a pitiful impression on\r\nthe rare occasions on which he appeared before the Commission, and was\r\nsubjected to a regular cross-examination.\r\n\r\nIn the course of his trial, Sukhomlinov himself recounted an episode\r\nwhich illustrates this state of affairs. One day, he arrived at a\r\nmeeting of the Commission when two important military questions were to\r\nbe discussed. He was stopped by Rodzianko,[3] who said to him:\r\n\r\n\"Get away, get away. You are to us as a red rag to a bull. As soon as\r\nyou come, your requests are turned down.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the Galician retreat, the Duma succeeded at last in enforcing the\r\nparticipation of its members in the task of placing on a proper basis\r\nall orders for the Army, and the Unions of Zemstvos and Towns were\r\npermitted to create the \"General Committee for provisioning the Army.\"\r\n\r\nThe hard experience of the war resulted at last in the simple scheme\r\nof mobilising the Russian industries. No sooner did this undertaking\r\nescape from the deadening atmosphere of military offices than it\r\nadvanced with giant strides. According to official data, in July, 1915,\r\neach Army received 33 parks of artillery instead of the requisite 50,\r\nwhereas, in September, the figure rose to 78, owing to the fact that\r\nprivate factories had been brought into the scheme. I am in a position\r\nto state, not only on the strength of figures, but from personal\r\nexperience, that, at the end of 1916, our Army, albeit falling short of\r\nthe high standards of the Allied armies in respect of equipment, had\r\nsufficient stores of ammunition and supplies wherewith to begin an\r\nextensive and carefully-planned operation along the entire front. These\r\ncircumstances were duly appreciated in the Army, and confidence in the\r\nDuma and in social organisations was thereby increased. The conditions\r\nof internal policy, however, were not improving. In the beginning of\r\n1917, out of the extremely tense atmosphere of political strife, there\r\narose the idea of a new remedy:\r\n\r\n                             \"REVOLUTION.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRepresentatives of certain Duma and social circles visited Alexeiev,\r\nwho was ill at Sevastopol. They told the General quite frankly that\r\na revolution was brewing. They knew what the effect would be in the\r\ncountry, but they could not tell how the front would be impressed, and\r\nwanted advice.\r\n\r\nAlexeiev strongly insisted that violent changes during the war were\r\ninadmissible, that they would constitute a deadly menace to the front,\r\nwhich, according to his pessimistic view, \"was already by no means\r\nsteady,\" and pleaded against any irretrievable steps for the sake of\r\npreserving the Army. The delegates departed, promising to take the\r\nnecessary measures in order to avert the contemplated revolution. I do\r\nnot know upon what information General Alexeiev based his subsequent\r\nstatement to the effect that the same delegates afterwards visited\r\nGenerals Brussilov and Ruzsky, and after these generals had expressed\r\nan opposite view to his, altered their previous decision; but the\r\npreparations for the revolution continued.\r\n\r\nIt is as yet difficult to elucidate all the details of these\r\nnegotiations. Those who conducted them are silent; there are no\r\nrecords; the whole matter was shrouded in secrecy, and did not reach\r\nthe bulk of the army. Certain facts, however, have been ascertained.\r\n\r\nSeveral people approached the Emperor, and warned him of the impending\r\ndanger to the country and the dynasty--Alexeiev, Gourko, the Archbishop\r\nShavelski, Purishkevitch (a reactionary member of the Duma), the Grand\r\nDukes Nicholas Mikhailovitch and Alexander Mikhailovitch, and the\r\nDowager Empress. After Rodzianko's visit to the Army in the autumn of\r\n1916, copies of his letter to the Emperor gained circulation in the\r\nArmy. In that letter the President of the Duma warned the Emperor of\r\nthe grave peril to the throne and the dynasty caused by the disastrous\r\nactivities of the Empress Alexandra in the sphere of internal policy.\r\nOn November 1st, the Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhailovitch read a letter to\r\nthe Emperor, in which he pointed out the impossible manner, known to\r\nall classes of society, in which Ministers were appointed, through the\r\nmedium of the appalling people who surrounded the Empress. The Grand\r\nDuke proceeded:\r\n\r\n\"... If you could succeed in removing this perpetual interference,\r\nthe renascence of Russia would begin at once, and you would recover\r\nthe confidence of the vast majority of your subjects which is now\r\nlost. When the time is ripe--and it is at hand--you can yourself grant\r\nfrom the throne the desired responsibility (of the Government) to\r\nyourself and the legislature. This will come about naturally, easily,\r\nwithout any pressure from without, and not in the same way as with\r\nthe memorable act of October 17th, 1905.[4] I hesitated for a long\r\ntime to tell you the truth, but made up my mind when your mother\r\nand your sisters persuaded me to do so. You are on the eve of new\r\ndisturbances, and, if I may say so, new attempts. Believe me, if I so\r\nstrongly emphasise the necessity for your liberation from the existing\r\nfetters, I am doing so not for personal motives, but only in the hope\r\nof saving you, your throne, and our beloved country from irretrievable\r\nconsequences of the gravest nature.\"\r\n\r\nAll these representations were of no avail.\r\n\r\nSeveral members of the right and of the liberal wing of the Duma and\r\nof the progressive bloc, members of the Imperial family, and officers,\r\njoined the circle. One of the Grand Dukes was to make a last appeal\r\nto the Emperor before active measures were undertaken. In the event\r\nof failure, the Imperial train was to be stopped by an armed force on\r\nits way from G.H.Q. to Petrograd. The Emperor was to be advised to\r\nabdicate, and, in the event of his refusal, he was to be removed by\r\nforce. The rightful heir, the Czarevitch Alexis, was to be proclaimed\r\nEmperor, and the Grand Duke Michael, Regent.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, a large group of the progressive bloc of the Duma, of\r\nrepresentatives of Zemstvos and towns--well versed in the activities of\r\nthe circle--held several meetings, at which the question was discussed\r\nof \"the part the Duma was to play after the _coup d'état_.\"[5] The new\r\nMinistry was then outlined, and of the two suggested candidates for the\r\nPremiership, Rodzianko and Prince Lvov, the latter was chosen.\r\n\r\nFate, however, decreed otherwise.\r\n\r\nBefore the contemplated _coup d'état_ took place, there began, in the\r\nwords of Albert Thomas, \"the brightest, the most festive, the most\r\nbloodless Russian Revolution.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE REVOLUTION IN PETROGRAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nI did not learn of the course of events in Petrograd and at G.H.Q.\r\nuntil some time had elapsed, and I will refer to these events briefly\r\nin order to preserve the continuity of my narrative. In a telegram\r\naddressed to the Emperor by the members of the Council of the Empire on\r\nthe night of the 28th February, the state of affairs was described as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\"Owing to the complete disorganisation of transport and to the lack\r\nof necessary materials, factories have stopped working. Forced\r\nunemployment, and the acute food crisis due to the disorganisation of\r\ntransport, have driven the popular masses to desperation. This feeling\r\nis further intensified by hatred towards the Government and grave\r\nsuspicions against the authorities, which have penetrated deeply into\r\nthe soul of the nation. All this has found expression in a popular\r\nrising of elemental dimensions, and the troops are now joining the\r\nmovement. The Government, which has never been trusted in Russia, is\r\nnow utterly discredited and incapable of coping with the dangerous\r\nsituation.\"\r\n\r\nPreparations for the Revolution found favourable ground in the\r\ngeneral condition of the country, and had been made long since. The\r\nmost heterogeneous elements had taken part in these activities; the\r\nGerman Government, which spared no means for Socialist and defeatist\r\npropaganda in Russia, and especially among the workmen; the Socialist\r\nparties, who had formed \"cells\" among the workmen and in the regiments;\r\nundoubtedly, too, the Protopopov Ministry, which was said to have been\r\nprovoking a rising in the streets in order to quell it by armed force,\r\nand thus clear the intolerably tense atmosphere. It would seem that all\r\nthese forces were aiming at the same goal, which they were trying to\r\nreach by diverse means, actuated by diametrically opposed motives.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the progressive block and social organisations began\r\nto prepare for great events which they considered inevitable, and other\r\ncircles, in close touch with these organisations or sharing their\r\nviews, were completing the arrangements for a \"_Palace coup d'état_\" as\r\nthe last means of averting the impending Revolution.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the rebellion started as an elemental force and caught\r\neverybody unawares. Several days later, when General Kornilov\r\nvisited the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet of Workmen\r\nand Soldiers' Deputies, prominent members of that body incidentally\r\nexplained that \"the soldiers mutinied independently of the workmen,\r\nwith whom the soldiers had not been in touch on the eve of the\r\nrebellion,\" and that the \"mutiny had not been prepared--hence the\r\nabsence of a corresponding administrative organ.\"\r\n\r\nAs regards the circles of the Duma and the social organisations, they\r\nwere prepared for a _coup d'état_, but not for the Revolution. In\r\nthe blazing fire of the outbreak they failed to preserve their moral\r\nbalance and judgment.\r\n\r\nThe first outbreak began on February 23rd, when crowds filled the\r\nstreets, meetings were held, and the speakers called for a struggle\r\nagainst the hated power. This lasted till the 26th, when the popular\r\nmovement assumed gigantic proportions and there were collisions with\r\nthe police, in which machine-guns were brought into action. On the\r\n26th an ukaze was received proroguing the Duma, and on the morning of\r\nthe 27th the members of the Duma decided not to leave Petrograd. On\r\nthe same morning the situation underwent a drastic change, because\r\nthe rebels were joined by the Reserve battalions of the Litovski,\r\nVolynski, Preobrajenski, and Sapper Guards' Regiments. They were\r\nReserve battalions, as the real Guards' Regiments were then on the\r\nSouth-Western Front. These battalions did not differ, either in\r\ndiscipline or spirit, from any other unit of the line. In several\r\nbattalions the Commanding Officers were disconcerted, and could not\r\nmake up their minds as to their own attitude. This wavering resulted,\r\nto a certain extent, in a loss of prestige and authority. The troops\r\ncame out into the streets without their officers, mingled with the\r\ncrowds, and were imbued with the crowds' psychology. Armed throngs,\r\nintoxicated with freedom, excited to the utmost, and incensed by street\r\norators, filled the streets, smashed the barricades, and new crowds of\r\nwaverers joined them. Police detachments were mercilessly slaughtered.\r\nOfficers who chanced to be in the way of the crowds were disarmed and\r\nsome of them killed. The armed mob seized the arsenal, the Fortress of\r\nPeter and Paul, and the Kresti Prison.\r\n\r\nOn that decisive day there were no leaders--there was only the tidal\r\nwave. Its terrible progress appeared to be devoid of any definite\r\nobject, plan, or watchword. The only cry that seemed to express the\r\ngeneral spirit was \"_Long live Liberty_.\"\r\n\r\nSomebody was bound to take the movement in hand. After violent\r\ndiscussions, much indecision and wavering, that part was assumed by the\r\nDuma. A Committee of the Duma was formed, which proclaimed its objects\r\non February 27th in the following guarded words:--\r\n\r\n\"In the strenuous circumstances of internal strife caused by the\r\nactivities of the old Government, the temporary Committee of the\r\nmembers of the Duma has felt compelled to undertake the task of\r\nrestoring order in the State and in society.... The Committee expresses\r\nits conviction that the population and the army will render assistance\r\nin the difficult task of creating a new Government, which will\r\ncorrespond to the wishes of the population, and which will be in a\r\nposition to enjoy its confidence.\"\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the Duma, having led the patriotic and\r\nnational struggle against the Government detested by the people, and\r\nhaving accomplished great and fruitful work in the interests of the\r\narmy, had obtained recognition in the country and in the army. The\r\nDuma now became the centre of the political life of the country. No\r\none else could have taken the lead in the movement. No one else could\r\nhave gained the confidence of the country, or such rapid and full\r\nrecognition as the Supreme Power, as the power that emanated from\r\nthe Duma. The Petrograd Soviet of Workmen and Soldiers' Deputies was\r\nfully aware of this fact, and it did not then claim _officially_ to\r\nrepresent the Russian Government. Such an attitude towards the Duma\r\nat that moment created the illusion of the _national_ character of\r\nthe Provisional Government created by the Duma. Alongside, therefore,\r\nwith the troops that mingled with the armed mob and destroyed in their\r\ntrail everything reminiscent of the old power, alongside with the\r\nunits that had remained faithful to that power and resisted the mob,\r\nregiments began to flock to the Taurida Palace with their commanding\r\nofficers, bands and banners. They greeted the new power in the person\r\nof Rodzianko, President of the Duma, according to the rules of the old\r\nritual. The Taurida Palace presented an unusual sight--legislators,\r\nbureaucrats, soldiers, workmen, women; a chamber, a camp, a prison,\r\na headquarters, Ministries. Everyone foregathered there seeking\r\nprotection and salvation, demanding guidance and answers to puzzling\r\nquestions which had suddenly arisen. On the same day, February 27th,\r\nan announcement was made from the Taurida Palace:--\r\n\r\n\"Citizens. Representatives of the workmen, soldiers and people of\r\nPetrograd, sitting in the Duma, declare that the first meeting of\r\ntheir representatives will take place at seven o'clock to-night on\r\nthe premises of the Duma. Let the troops that have joined the people\r\nimmediately elect their representatives--one to each company. Let the\r\nfactories elect their deputies--one to each thousand. Factories with\r\nless than a thousand workmen to elect one deputy each.\"\r\n\r\nThis proclamation had a grave and fateful effect upon the entire course\r\nof events. In the first place, it created an organ of unofficial,\r\nbut undoubtedly stronger, power alongside with the provisional\r\nGovernment--the Soviet of Workmen and Soldiers' deputies, against which\r\nthe Government proved impotent. In the second place, it converted the\r\npolitical and bourgeois revolution, both outwardly and inwardly, into\r\na social revolution, which was unthinkable, considering the condition\r\nof the country at that time. Such a revolution in war time could not\r\nfail to bring about terrible upheavals. Lastly, it established a close\r\nconnection between the Soviet, which was inclined towards Bolshevism\r\nand defeatism, and the army, which was thus infected with a ferment\r\nwhich resulted in its ultimate collapse. When the troops, fully\r\nofficered, smartly paraded before the Taurida Palace, it was only\r\nfor show. The link between the officers and the men had already been\r\nirretrievably broken; discipline had been shattered. Henceforward, the\r\ntroops of the Petrograd district represented a kind of Pretorian guard,\r\nwhose evil force weighed heavily over the Provisional Government. All\r\nsubsequent efforts made by Gutchkov, General Kornilov and G.H.Q. to\r\ninfluence them and to send them to the front were of no avail, owing to\r\nthe determined resistance of the Soviet.\r\n\r\nThe position of the officers was undoubtedly tragic, as they had to\r\nchoose between loyalty to their oath, the distrust and enmity of the\r\nmen, and the dictates of practical necessity. A small portion of the\r\nofficers offered armed resistance to the mutiny, and most of them\r\nperished. Some avoided taking any part in the events, but the majority\r\nin the regiments, where comparative order prevailed, tried to find in\r\nthe Duma a solution of the questions which perturbed their conscience.\r\nAt a big meeting of officers held in Petrograd on March 1st, a\r\nresolution was carried: \"To stand by the people and unanimously to\r\nrecognise the power of the Executive Committee of the Duma, pending the\r\nconvocation of the Constituent Assembly; because a speedy organisation\r\nof order and of united work in the rear were necessary for the\r\nvictorious end of the war.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOwing to the unrestrained orgy of power in which the successive\r\nrulers appointed at Rasputin's suggestion had indulged during their\r\nshort terms of office, there was in 1917 no political party, no class\r\nupon which the Czarist Government could rely. Everybody considered\r\nthat Government as the enemy of the people. Extreme Monarchists\r\nand Socialists, the united nobility, labour groups, Grand Dukes\r\nand half-educated soldiers--all were of the same opinion. I do not\r\nintend to examine the activities of the Government which led to the\r\nRevolution, its struggle against the people and against representative\r\ninstitutions. I will only draw a summary of the accusations which were\r\njustly levelled by the Duma against the Government on the eve of its\r\ndownfall:\r\n\r\nAll the Institutions of the State and of society--the Council of the\r\nEmpire, the Duma, the nobility, the Zemstvos, the municipalities--were\r\nunder suspicion of disloyalty, and the Government was in open\r\nopposition to them, and paralysed all their activities in matters of\r\nstatesmanship and social welfare.\r\n\r\nLawlessness and espionage had reached unheard-of proportions. The\r\nindependent Russian Courts of Justice became subservient to \"the\r\nrequirements of the political moment.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Funeral of the first victims of the March Revolution in\r\nPetrograd.]\r\n\r\nWhilst in the Allied countries all classes of society worked\r\nwhole-heartedly for the defence of their countries, in Russia that\r\nwork was repudiated with contempt, and the work was done by unskilled\r\nand occasionally criminal hands, which resulted in such disastrous\r\nphenomena as the activities of Sukhomlinov and Protopopov. The\r\nCommittee \"of Military Industries,\" which had rendered great services\r\nin provisioning the Army, was being systematically destroyed. Shortly\r\nbefore the Revolution its labour section was arrested without any\r\nreason being assigned, and this very nearly caused sanguinary\r\ndisturbances in the capital. Measures adopted by the Government without\r\nthe participation of social organisations shattered the industrial life\r\nof the country. Transport was disorganised, and fuel was wasted. The\r\nGovernment proved incapable and impotent in combating this disorder,\r\nwhich was undoubtedly caused to a certain extent by the selfish and\r\nsometimes rapacious designs of industrial magnates. The villages were\r\nderelict. A series of wholesale mobilisations, without any exemptions\r\ngranted to classes which worked for defence, deprived the villages\r\nof labour. Prices were unsettled, and the big landowners were given\r\ncertain privileges. Later, the grain contribution was gravely\r\nmismanaged. There was no exchange of goods between towns and villages.\r\nAll this resulted in the stopping of food supplies, famine in the\r\ntowns, and repression in the villages. Government servants of all kinds\r\nwere impoverished by the tremendous rise in prices of commodities, and\r\nwere grumbling loudly.\r\n\r\nMinisterial appointments were staggering in their fitfulness, and\r\nappeared to the people as a kind of absurdity. The demands of the\r\ncountry for a responsible Cabinet were voiced by the Duma and by the\r\nbest men. As late as the morning of February 27th, the Duma considered\r\nthat the granting of the minimum of the political desiderata of Russian\r\nsociety was sufficient to postpone \"the last hour in which the fate\r\nof the Mother Country and of the dynasty was to be settled.\" Public\r\nopinion and the Press were smothered; the Military Censorship of all\r\ninternal regions (including Moscow and Petrograd) had made the widest\r\nuse of its telephones. It was impregnable, protected by all the powers\r\nof martial law. Ordinary censorship was no less severe. The following\r\nstriking fact was discussed in the Duma:\r\n\r\nIn February, 1917, a strike movement, prompted to a certain extent\r\nby the Germans, began to spread in the factories. The Labour members\r\nof the Military Industries Committee then drafted a proclamation, as\r\nfollows:--\"Comrades, workmen of Petrograd, we deem it our duty to\r\naddress to you an urgent request to resume work. The labouring class,\r\nfully aware of its present-day responsibilities, must not weaken itself\r\nby a protracted strike. The interests of the labouring class are\r\ncalling upon you to resume work.\" In spite of Gutchkov's appeal to the\r\nMinister of the Interior and to the Chief Censor, this appeal was twice\r\nremoved from the printing press, and was prohibited.\r\n\r\nThe question is still open for discussion and investigation as to\r\nwhat proportion of the activities of the old régime in the domain\r\nof economics can be attributed to individuals, what to the system,\r\nand what to the insuperable obstacles created in the country by a\r\ndevastating war. But no excuse will ever be found for stifling the\r\nconscience, the mind, and the spirit of the people and all social\r\ninitiative. No wonder, therefore, that Moscow and the provinces joined\r\nthe Revolution without any appreciable resistance. Outside Petrograd,\r\nwhere the terror of street fighting and the rowdiness of a bloodthirsty\r\nmob were absent (there were, however, many exceptions), the Revolution\r\nwas greeted with satisfaction, and even with enthusiasm, not only by\r\nthe Revolutionary Democracy, but by the real Democracy, the Bourgeoisie\r\nand the Civil Service. There was tremendous animation; thousands of\r\npeople thronged the streets. Fiery speeches were made. There was great\r\nrejoicing at the deliverance from the terrible nightmare; there were\r\nbright hopes for the future of Russia. There was the word:\r\n\r\n\"LIBERTY.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in the air. It was reproduced in speeches, drawings, in music,\r\nin song. It was stimulating. It was not yet stained by stupidity, by\r\nfilth and blood.\r\n\r\nPrince Eugene Troubetskoi wrote: \"This Revolution is unique. There\r\nhave been bourgeois revolutions and proletarian revolutions, but such\r\na national Revolution, in the broadest sense of the word, as the\r\npresent Russian Revolution, there has never been. Everyone took part\r\nin this Revolution, everyone made it: the proletariat, the troops,\r\nthe bourgeoisie, even the nobility ... all the live forces of the\r\ncountry.... May this unity endure!\" In these words the hopes and fears\r\nof the Russian intelligencia, not the sad Russian realities, are\r\nreflected. The cruel mutinies at Helsingfors, Kronstadt, Reval, and the\r\nassassination of Admiral Nepenin and of many officers were the first\r\nwarnings to the optimists.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the first days of the Revolution the victims in the Capital were\r\nfew. According to the registration of the All-Russian Union of Towns,\r\nthe total number of killed and wounded in Petrograd was 1,443,\r\nincluding 869 soldiers (of whom 60 were officers). Of course, many\r\nwounded were not registered. The condition of Petrograd, however, out\r\nof gear and full of inflammable material and armed men, remained for a\r\nlong time strained and unstable. I heard later from members of the Duma\r\nand of the Government that the scales were swaying violently, and that\r\nthey felt like sitting on a powder-barrel which might explode at any\r\nmoment and blow to bits both themselves and the structure of the new\r\nGovernment which they were creating. The Deputy-Chairman of the Soviet\r\nof Workmen and Soldiers' Deputies, Skobelev, said to a journalist:--\r\n\r\n\"I must confess that, when in the beginning of the Revolution, I\r\nwent to the entrance of the Taurida Palace to meet the first band of\r\nsoldiers that had come to the Duma, and when I addressed them, I was\r\nalmost certain that I was delivering one of my last speeches, and that\r\nin the course of the next few days I should be shot or hanged.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral officers who had taken part in the events assured me that\r\ndisorder and the universal incapacity for understanding the position in\r\nthe Capital were so great that _one solid battalion_, commanded by an\r\nofficer who knew what he wanted, might have upset the entire position.\r\nBe that as it may, the temporary Committee of the Duma proclaimed on\r\nMarch 2nd the formation of a Provisional Government. After lengthy\r\ndiscussions with the parallel organs of \"Democratic Power,\" the Soviet\r\nof Workmen and Soldiers' Deputies, the Provisional Government issued a\r\ndeclaration:--\r\n\r\n\"(1) Full and immediate amnesty for all political, religious and\r\nterrorist crimes, military mutinies and agrarian offences, etc.\r\n\r\n\"(2) Freedom of speech, the Press, meetings, unions and strikes.\r\nPolitical liberties to be granted to all men serving in the Army within\r\nthe limits of military requirements.\r\n\r\n\"(3) Cancellation of all restrictions of class, religion and\r\nnationality.\r\n\r\n\"(4) Immediate preparation for the convocation of a Constituent\r\nAssembly elected by universal, equal, direct and secret suffrage for\r\nthe establishment of a form of government and of the Constitution of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n\"(5) The police to be replaced by a people's Militia, with elected\r\nchiefs, subordinate to the organ of Local Self-Government.\r\n\r\n\"(6) Members of Local Self-Governing Institutions to be elected by\r\nuniversal, equal, direct and secret suffrage.\r\n\r\n\"(7) The units of the Army that have taken part in the Revolutionary\r\nmovement are not to be disarmed or removed from Petrograd.\r\n\r\n\"(8) Military discipline to be preserved on parade and on duty. The\r\nsoldiers, however, are to be free to enjoy all social rights enjoyed by\r\nother citizens.\r\n\r\n\"The Provisional Government deems it its duty to add that it has no\r\nintention of taking advantage of wartime to delay carrying out the\r\naforesaid reforms and measures.\"\r\n\r\nThis Declaration was quite obviously drafted under pressure from the\r\n\"parallel power.\"\r\n\r\nIn his book, _Mes Souvenirs de Guerre_, General Ludendorff says: \"I\r\noften dreamt of that Revolution which was to alleviate the burdens\r\nof our war. Eternal chimera! To-day, however, the dream suddenly and\r\nunexpectedly came true. I felt as if a heavy load had fallen off my\r\nshoulders. I could not, however, foresee that it would be the grave of\r\nour might.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most prominent leaders of Germany--the country that had\r\nworked so hard for the poisoning of the soul of the Russian people--has\r\ncome to the belated conclusion that \"Our moral collapse began with the\r\nbeginning of the Russian Revolution.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE REVOLUTION AND THE IMPERIAL FAMILY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlone in the Governor's old Palace at Mohilev the Czar suffered in\r\nsilence; his wife and children were far away, and there was no one with\r\nhim in whom he was able or willing to confide.\r\n\r\nProtopopov and the Government had at first represented the state of\r\naffairs as serious, but not alarming--popular disturbances to be\r\nsuppressed with \"a firm hand.\" Several hundred machine-guns had been\r\nplaced at the disposal of General Habalov, Commander of the troops of\r\nthe Petrograd district. Both he and Prince Golitzin, President of the\r\nCabinet, had been given full authority to make use of exceptional means\r\nof quelling the riots. On the morning of the 27th General Ivanov had\r\nbeen despatched with a small detachment of troops and a secret warrant,\r\nto be made public after the occupation of Czarskoe Selo. The warrant\r\ninvested him with full military and civic powers. No one could have\r\nbeen less fitted than General Ivanov to occupy so highly important\r\na position, which amounted actually to a Military Dictatorship.\r\nIvanov was a very old man--an honest soldier, unfitted to cope with\r\npolitical complications and no longer in possession of strength,\r\nenergy, will-power, or determination.... His success in dealing with\r\nthe Kronstadt disturbances of 1906 most probably suggested his present\r\nnomination.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, when looking over Habalov's and Bieliaiev's[6] reports,\r\nI was aghast at the pusillanimity and the shirking of responsibility\r\nwhich they revealed.\r\n\r\nThe clouds continue to darken.\r\n\r\nOn February 26th the Empress wired to the Czar: \"Am very anxious\r\nabout the state of affairs in town....\" On the same day Rodzianko\r\nsent his historic telegram: \"Position serious. Anarchy in the\r\ncapital. Government paralysed. Transport, supplies of fuel and\r\nother necessaries completely disorganised. General discontent grows.\r\nDisorderly firing in the streets. Military units fire at each other.\r\nImperative necessity that some person popular in the country should be\r\nauthorised to form new Cabinet. No delay possible. Any delay fatal.\r\nI pray God that the Monarch be not now held responsible.\" Rodzianko\r\nforwarded copies of his telegram to all the Commanders-in-Chief, asking\r\ntheir support.\r\n\r\nEarly on the 27th the President of the Duma wired again to the Czar:\r\n\"Position constantly aggravated. Measures must be taken immediately, as\r\nto-morrow may be too late. This hour decides the fate of our country\r\nand the dynasty.\"\r\n\r\nIt is incredible that, after this, the Czar should not have realised\r\nthe impending catastrophe, but, in the weakness and irresolution\r\nthat characterised him, it is probable that he seized the slightest\r\navailable excuse to postpone his decision, and in a fatalistic manner,\r\nleft to fate to carry out her secret decrees....\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, another impressive warning from General Alexeiev,\r\nconfirmed by telegrams from the Commanders-in-Chief, yielded no better\r\nresults, and the Czar, anxious about the fate of his family, left for\r\nCzarskoe Selo on the morning of the 29th, without coming to any final\r\ndecision on the concessions to be granted to his people.\r\n\r\nGeneral Alexeiev, although straightforward, wise, and patriotic, was\r\nlacking in firmness, and his power and influence with the Emperor were\r\ntoo slight to permit of his insisting on a step the obvious necessity\r\nfor which was evident even to the Empress. She wired to her husband on\r\nthe 27th: \"Concessions inevitable.\"\r\n\r\nThe futile journey was two days in accomplishment. Two days without\r\nany correspondence or news as to the course of events, which were\r\ndeveloping and changing every hour.... The Imperial train, taking a\r\nroundabout course, was stopped at Vishera by orders from Petrograd.\r\nOn hearing that the Petrograd garrison had acclaimed the Provisional\r\nCommittee of the Duma, and that the troops of Czarskoe Selo had sided\r\nwith the Revolution, the Czar returned to Pskov.\r\n\r\nAt Pskov, on the evening of March 1st, the Czar saw General Ruzsky, who\r\nexplained the position to him, but no decision was arrived at, except\r\nthat on the 2nd of March, at 2 a.m., the Czar again sent for Ruzsky,\r\nand handed him an ukase, which made the Cabinet responsible to the\r\nDuma. \"I knew that this compromise had come too late,\" said Ruzsky to\r\na correspondent, \"but I had no right to express my opinion, not having\r\nreceived any instructions from the Executive Committee of the Duma, so\r\nI suggested that the Emperor should see Rodzianko.\"[7]\r\n\r\nAll night long discussions full of deep interest and importance to the\r\nfate of the country were held over the wire--between Ruzsky, Rodzianko,\r\nand Alexeiev; between Headquarters and the Commanders-in-Chief, and\r\nbetween Lukomsky[8] and Danilov.[9]\r\n\r\nThey unanimously agreed that the Abdication of the Emperor was\r\nunavoidable.\r\n\r\nBefore midday on March 2nd Ruzsky communicated the opinion of Rodzianko\r\nand the Military Commanders to the Czar. The Emperor heard him calmly,\r\nwith no sign of emotion on his fixed, immovable countenance, but at 3\r\np.m. he sent Ruzsky a signed Act of Abdication in favour of his son--a\r\ndocument drawn up at Headquarters and forwarded to him at Pskov.\r\n\r\nIf the sequence of historical events follows immutable laws of its\r\nown, there also seems to be a fate influencing casual happenings of\r\na simple, everyday nature, which otherwise seem quite avoidable. The\r\nthirty minutes that elapsed after Ruzsky had received the Act of\r\nAbdication materially affected the whole course of subsequent events:\r\nbefore copies of the document could be despatched, a communication,\r\nannouncing the delegates of the Duma, Gutchkov and Shulgin, was\r\nreceived.... The Czar again postponed his decision and stopped the\r\npublication of the Act.\r\n\r\nThe delegates arrived in the evening.\r\n\r\nAmidst the complete silence of the audience,[10] Gutchkov pictured the\r\nabyss that the country was nearing, and pointed out the only course to\r\nbe taken--the abdication of the Czar.\r\n\r\n\"I have been thinking about it all yesterday and to-day, and have\r\ndecided to abdicate,\" answered the Czar. \"Until three o'clock to-day I\r\nwas willing to abdicate in favour of my son, but I then came to realise\r\nthat I could not bear to part with him. I hope you will understand\r\nthis? As a consequence, I have decided to abdicate in favour of my\r\nbrother.\"\r\n\r\nThe delegates, taken aback by such an unexpected turn of events,\r\nmade no objection. Emotion kept Gutchkov silent. \"He felt he could\r\nnot intrude on paternal relations, and considered that any pressure\r\nbrought to bear upon the Emperor would be out of place.\" Shulgin was\r\ninfluenced by political motives. \"He feared the little Czar might grow\r\nup harbouring feelings of resentment against those who had parted him\r\nfrom his father and mother; also the question whether a regent could\r\ntake the oath to the Constitution on behalf of an Emperor, who was not\r\nof age was a matter of debate.\"[11]\r\n\r\n\"The resentment\" of the little Czar concerned a distant future. As to\r\nlegality, the very essence of a Revolution precludes the legality of\r\nits consequences. Also the _enforced_ abdication of Nicholas II., his\r\nrejection of the rights of inheritance of _his son_, a minor, and,\r\nlastly, the transfer of supreme power by Michael Alexandrovitch, a\r\nperson who _had never_ held it, to the Provisional Government by means\r\nof an act, in which the Grand Duke \"appeals\" to Russian citizens to\r\nobey the Government, are all of doubtful legality.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that, \"in the minds of those living in those\r\nfirst days of the Revolution\"--as Miliukov says--\"the new Government,\r\nestablished by the Revolution, was looked upon, not as a consequence\r\nof the acts of March 2nd and 3rd, but as a result of the events of\r\nFebruary 27th....\"\r\n\r\nI may add that later, in the minds of many Commanding Officers--amongst\r\nthem, Kornilov, Alexeiev, Romanovsky and Markov, who played a\r\nleading part in the attempt to save Russia--legal, party or dynastic\r\nconsiderations had no place. This circumstance is of primary importance\r\nfor a proper understanding of subsequent events.\r\n\r\nAbout midnight on March 2nd the Czar handed Rodzianko and Ruzsky two\r\nslightly amended copies of the Manifesto of his Abdication.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"In the midst of our great conflict with a foreign enemy, who has been\r\nstriving for close on three years to enslave our country, it has been\r\nthe will of God to subject Russia to new and heavy trials. Incipient\r\npopular disturbances now imperil the further course of the stubborn\r\nwar. The fate of Russia, the honour of our heroic Army, the entire\r\nfuture of our beloved Land, demand that the war should be carried to a\r\nvictorious conclusion.\r\n\r\n\"The cruel foe is nearly at his last gasp, and the hour approaches when\r\nour gallant Army, together with our glorious Allies, will finally crush\r\nour enemy's resistance. In these decisive days of Russia's existence we\r\nfeel it our duty to further the firm cohesion and unification of all\r\nthe forces of the people, and, with the approval of the State Duma,\r\nconsider it best to abdicate the Throne of Russia and lay down our\r\nsupreme power. Not wishing to part from our beloved Son, we transmit\r\nour inheritance to our Brother, the Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovitch,\r\nand give him our blessing in ascending the Throne of the Russian Empire.\r\n\r\n\"We command our Brother to rule the State in complete and undisturbed\r\nunion with the representatives of the people in such Legislative\r\nInstitutions as the People will see fit to establish, binding himself\r\nby oath thereto in the name of our beloved country.\r\n\r\n\"I call all true sons of the Fatherland to fulfil their sacred duty--to\r\nobey the Czar in this time of sore distress and help him, together with\r\nthe representatives of the people, to lead the Russian State along the\r\nroad to victory, happiness and glory.\r\n\r\n\"May the Lord our God help Russia!\r\n\r\n                                                             \"NICHOLAS.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLate at night the Imperial train left for Mohilev. Dead silence,\r\nlowered blinds and heavy, heavy thoughts. No one will ever know what\r\nfeelings wrestled in the breast of Nicholas II., of the Monarch, the\r\nFather and the Man, when, on meeting Alexeiev at Mohilev, and looking\r\nstraight at the latter with kindly, tired eyes, he said irresolutely:--\r\n\r\n_\"I have changed my mind. Please send this telegram to Petrograd.\"_\r\n\r\n_On a small sheet of paper, in a clear hand, the Czar had himself\r\ntraced his consent to the immediate accession to the throne of his son,\r\nAlexis_....\r\n\r\nAlexeiev took the telegram, and--did not send it. It was too late; both\r\nManifestoes had already been made public to the Army and to the country.\r\n\r\nFor fear of \"unsettling public opinion,\" Alexeiev made no mention\r\nof the telegram, and kept it in his portfolio until he passed it on\r\nto me towards the end of May, when he resigned his post of Supreme\r\nCommander-in-Chief. The document, of vast importance to future\r\nbiographers of the Czar, was afterwards kept under seal at the\r\nOperations Department of General Headquarters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeantime, the members of the Cabinet and of the Provisional\r\nCommittee[12] had assembled at the Palace of the Grand Duke Michael\r\nAlexandrovitch about midday on May 3rd. Since the 27th of February,\r\nthe latter had been cut off from all communication with Headquarters\r\nor with the Emperor. But the issue of this Conference was practically\r\npredetermined by the spirit prevailing in the Soviet of Workmen's\r\nDelegates, after the gist of the Manifesto became known to them, by the\r\nResolution of Protest passed by their Executive Committee and forwarded\r\nto the Government, by Kerensky's uncompromising attitude, and by the\r\ngeneral correlation of forces. Except Miliukov and Gutchkov, all the\r\nothers, \"without the faintest desire of influencing the Grand Duke\r\nin any way,\" eagerly advised him to abdicate. Miliukov warned them\r\nthat \"the support of a symbol familiar to the masses is necessary,\r\nif decided authority is to be maintained, and that the Provisional\r\nGovernment, if left alone, might founder in the sea of popular\r\ndisturbances, and that it might not survive until the Convocation of\r\nthe Constituent Assembly....\"\r\n\r\nAfter another conference with Rodzianko, President of the Duma, the\r\nGrand Duke came to his final decision to abdicate.\r\n\r\nThe \"Declaration\" of the Grand Duke was published on the same day:\r\n\r\n    \"A heavy burden has been laid on me by the wish of my Brother, who\r\n    has transferred the Imperial Throne of All Russia to me at a time\r\n    of unexampled warfare and popular disturbances.\r\n\r\n    \"Animated, together with the nation, by one thought, that the\r\n    welfare of our country must prevail over every other consideration,\r\n    I have decided to accept supreme power only if such be the will\r\n    of our great people, whose part it is to establish the form of\r\n    government and new fundamental laws of the Russian State through\r\n    their representatives in the Constituent Assembly.\r\n\r\n    \"With a prayer to God for His blessing, I appeal to all citizens\r\n    of the Russian State to obey the Provisional Government, which\r\n    is constituted and invested with full powers by the will of the\r\n    State Duma, until a Constituent Assembly, convoked at the earliest\r\n    possible moment by universal, direct, equal and secret suffrage,\r\n    can establish a form of government which will embody the will of\r\n    the people.\"\r\n\r\n                                                              \"MICHAEL.\"\r\n\r\nAfter his abdication, the Grand Duke resided in the neighbourhood of\r\nGatchino, and stood completely aloof from political life. About the\r\nmiddle of March, 1918, he was arrested by order of the local Bolshevik\r\nCommittee, taken to Petrograd, and, some time later, exiled to the\r\nGovernment of Perm.\r\n\r\nIt was rumoured that the Grand Duke, accompanied by his faithful\r\nEnglish valet, had escaped about the middle of July; since then nothing\r\ndefinite has been heard about him. The search organised by the Siberian\r\nGovernment and by that of Southern Russia, as also by the desire of the\r\nDowager Empress, yielded no certain results. The Bolsheviks, for their\r\npart, volunteered no official information whatever. But subsequent\r\ninvestigations brought some data to light which indicated that the\r\n\"release\" was a deception, and that the Grand Duke was secretly carried\r\noff by Bolsheviks, murdered in the vicinity of Perm, and his body\r\ndrowned under the ice.\r\n\r\nThe mystery of the Grand Duke's fate gave rise to fanciful rumours\r\nand even to the appearance of impostors in Siberia. During the summer\r\nof 1918, at the time of the first successful advance of the Siberian\r\ntroops, it was widely reported both in Soviet Russia and in the South\r\nthat the Siberian Anti-Bolshevist forces were led by the Grand Duke\r\nMichael Alexandrovitch. Periodically, until late in 1919, his spurious\r\nmanifestoes appeared in the Provincial Press, chiefly in papers of the\r\nextreme Right.\r\n\r\nIt must be noted, however, that when, in the summer of 1918, the Kiev\r\nmonarchists carried on an active campaign to impart a monarchical\r\ncharacter to the Anti-Bolshevist military movement, they rejected the\r\nprinciple of legitimacy, partly because of the personality of some of\r\nthe candidates, and, in regard to Michael Alexandrovitch, because he\r\nhad \"tied himself\" by a solemn promise to the Constituent Assembly.\r\n\r\nIn consideration of the complexity and confusion of the conditions that\r\nobtained in March, 1917, I have come to the conclusion that a struggle\r\nto retain Nicholas II. at the head of the State would have led to\r\nanarchy, disruption of the Front, and terrible consequences, both for\r\nthe Czar and for the country. A Regency, with Michael Alexandrovitch\r\nas Regent, might have involved conflict, but no disturbance, and was\r\ncertain of success. It would have been more difficult to place Michael\r\nAlexandrovitch on the throne, but even that would have been possible if\r\na Constitution on broad, democratic lines had been accepted by him.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Provisional Government and of the Provisional\r\nCommittee--Miliukov and Gutchkov excepted--terrorised by the Soviets of\r\nWorkmen's Delegates, and attributing too much importance to them and to\r\nthe excited workmen and soldier masses in Petrograd, took on themselves\r\na heavy responsibility for the future when they persuaded the Grand\r\nDuke to decline the immediate assumption of Supreme Power.[13]\r\n\r\nI am not referring to Monarchism or to a particular dynasty. These are\r\nsecondary questions. I am speaking of Russia only.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly hard to say whether this power would have been lasting\r\nand stable, whether it would not have undergone changes later on; but,\r\nif it had even succeeded in maintaining the Army during the war, the\r\nsubsequent course of Russian history might have been one of progress,\r\nand the upheavals that now endanger her very existence might have been\r\navoided.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn March 7th the Provisional Government issued an order according to\r\nwhich \"The ex-Emperor and his Consort are deprived of liberty, and the\r\nex-Emperor is to be taken to Czarskoe Selo.\" The duty of arresting the\r\nEmpress was laid on Kornilov, and orthodox Monarchists never forgave\r\nhim for it. But, strangely enough, Alexandra Fedorovna, after hearing\r\nof the warrant, expressed her satisfaction that the renowned General\r\nKornilov, and not a member of the new Government, had been sent to her.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor was arrested by four members of the Duma.\r\n\r\nOn March 8th, after leave-takings at Headquarters, the Czar quitted\r\nMohilev amidst the stony silence of the crowd, and under the tearful\r\neyes of his mother, who never saw her son again.\r\n\r\nTo understand the seemingly incomprehensible behaviour of the\r\nGovernment to the Imperial family during the period of their residence\r\nboth at Czarskoe Selo and at Tobolsk, the following circumstances must\r\nbe kept in mind. Notwithstanding that, in the seven and a half months\r\nof the existence of the Provisional Government, not one single serious\r\nattempt was made to liberate the captives, yet they attracted the\r\nexclusive attention of the Soviet of Workmen and Soldiers' Delegates.\r\nOn March 10th Vice-President Sokolov made the following announcement\r\nto a unanimously approving audience: \"I was informed yesterday that\r\nthe Provisional Government had consented to allow Nicholas II. to go\r\nto England and that it is discussing arrangements with the British\r\nauthorities without the knowledge or the consent of the Executive\r\nCommittee of Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates. We have mobilised all\r\nthe military units that we can influence, and have taken measures to\r\nprevent Nicholas II. from leaving Czarskoe without our permission.\r\nTelegrams have been sent down the railway lines ... to detain the train\r\nof Nicholas II. should it appear.... We have despatched our Commissars\r\nwith the necessary number of troops and armoured cars, and have closely\r\nsurrounded the Alexander Palace. After that we conferred with the\r\nProvisional Government, who confirmed all our orders. At present\r\nthe late Czar is under our protection, as well as under that of the\r\nProvisional Government....\"\r\n\r\nOn the 1st August, 1917, the Imperial family was exiled to Tobolsk,\r\nand, after the establishment of Bolshevist rule in Siberia, they were\r\ntransferred to Ekaterinburg, and were the victims of incredible insults\r\nand cruelty by the mob, until they were put to death.[14] Thus did\r\nNicholas II. atone for his grievous sins, voluntary and involuntary,\r\nagainst the Russian people.[15]\r\n\r\nIn the course of the second Kuban campaign I received the news of the\r\ndeath of the Emperor Nicholas II., and ordered memorial services for\r\nthe soul of the former leader of the Russian Army to be held in the\r\nVolunteer Army. Democratic circles and the Press criticised me severely\r\nfor this.\r\n\r\nThe words of wisdom, _Vengeance is mine: I will repay_, were obviously\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE REVOLUTION AND THE ARMY.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER NO. 1.\r\n\r\nThese events found me far away from the Capital, in Roumania, where I\r\nwas commanding the Eighth Army Corps. In our remoteness from the Mother\r\nCountry we felt a certain tension in the political atmosphere, but we\r\ncertainly were not prepared for the sudden _dénouement_ or for the\r\nshape it assumed.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of March 3rd I received a telegram from Army\r\nHeadquarters--\"For personal information\"--to the effect that a mutiny\r\nhad broken out in Petrograd, that the Duma had assumed power, and that\r\nthe publication of important State documents was expected. A few hours\r\nlater the wire transmitted the manifestoes of the Emperor Nicholas\r\nthe Second and of the Grand Duke Michael. At first an order was given\r\nfor their distribution, then, much to my amazement (as the telephones\r\nhad already been spreading the news) the order was countermanded\r\nand finally confirmed. These waverings were apparently due to the\r\nnegotiations between the temporary Committee of the Duma and the\r\nHeadquarters of the Norman Front about postponing the publication of\r\nthese Acts owing to a sudden change in the Emperor's fundamental idea,\r\nnamely, the substitution of the Grand Duke Michael for the Grand Duke\r\nAlexis as Heir to the Throne. It proved, however, impossible to delay\r\nthe distribution. The troops were thunderstruck. No other word can\r\ndescribe the first impression produced by the _manifestoes_. There was\r\nneither sorrow nor rejoicing. There was deep, thoughtful silence. Thus\r\ndid the regiments of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Divisions take the\r\nnews of the abdication of their Emperor. Only occasionally on parade\r\ndid the rifle waver and tears course down the cheeks of old soldiers.\r\n\r\nIn order accurately to describe the spirit of the moment, undimmed by\r\nthe passing of time, I will quote extracts from a letter I wrote to a\r\nnear relation on March 8th:\r\n\r\n\"A page of history has been turned. The first impression is stunning\r\nbecause it is so unexpected and so grandiose. On the whole, however,\r\nthe troops have taken the events quietly. They express themselves\r\nwith caution; but three definite currents in the mentality of the men\r\ncan easily be traced: (1) A return to the past is impossible; (2) the\r\ncountry will receive a Constitution worthy of a great people, probably\r\na Constitutional Limited Monarchy; (3) German domination will come to\r\nan end and the war will be victoriously prosecuted.\"\r\n\r\nThe Emperor's abdication was considered as the inevitable result of\r\nthe internal policy of the last few years. There was, however, no\r\nirritation against the Emperor personally or against the Imperial\r\nFamily. Everything was forgiven and forgotten. On the contrary,\r\neveryone was interested in their fate, and feared the worst. The\r\nappointment of the Grand Duke Nicholas as Supreme Commander-in-Chief,\r\nand of General Alexeiev as his Chief-of-Staff, was favourably received,\r\nalike by officers and men, and interest was manifested in the question\r\nas to whether the Army would be represented in the Constituent\r\nAssembly. The composition of the Provisional Government was treated\r\nmore or less as a matter of indifference. The appointment of a civilian\r\nto the War Ministry was criticised, and it was only the part he had\r\ntaken in the Council of National Defence, and his close connection with\r\nthe officers' circles, that mitigated the unfavourable impression. A\r\ngreat many people have found it surprising and incomprehensible that\r\nthe collapse of a Monarchist régime several centuries old should not\r\nhave provoked in the Army, bred in its traditions, either a struggle or\r\neven isolated outbreaks, or that the Army should not have created its\r\nown Vendée.\r\n\r\nI know of three cases only of stout resistance: The march of General\r\nIvanov's detachment on Czarskoe Selo, organised by Headquarters in\r\nthe first days of the risings in Petrograd, very badly executed and\r\nsoon countermanded, and two telegrams addressed to the Emperor by\r\nthe Commanding Officers of the Third Cavalry and the Guards Cavalry\r\nCorps, Count Keller (killed in Kiev in 1918 by Petlura's men) and Khan\r\nNachitchevansky. They both offered themselves and their troops for\r\nthe suppression of the mutiny. It would be a mistake to assume that\r\nthe Army was quite prepared to accept the provisional \"Democratic\r\nRepublic,\" that there were no \"loyal\" units or \"loyal\" chiefs ready\r\nto engage in the struggle. They undoubtedly existed. There were,\r\nhowever, two circumstances which exercised a restraining influence.\r\nIn the first place, both Acts of Abdication were apparently legal,\r\nand the second of these Acts, in summoning the people to submit to\r\nthe Provisional Government \"invested with full power,\" took the wind\r\nout of the sails of the monarchists. In the second place, it was\r\napprehended that civil war might open the front to the enemy. The Army\r\nwas _then_ obedient to its leaders, and they--General Alexeiev and all\r\nthe Commanders-in-Chief--recognised the new power. The newly-appointed\r\nSupreme Commander-in-Chief, the Grand Duke Nicholas, said in his first\r\nOrder of the Day: \"The power is established in the person of the new\r\nGovernment. I, the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, have recognised that\r\npower for the good of our Mother Country, serving as an example to us\r\nof our duty as soldiers. I order all ranks of our gallant Army and Navy\r\nimplicitly to obey the established Government through their direct\r\nChiefs. Only then will God grant us victory.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe days went by. I began to receive many--both slight and important--\r\nexpressions of bewilderment and questions from the units of my corps:\r\nWho represents the Supreme Power in Russia? Is it the temporary\r\nCommittee which created the Provisional Government, or is it the\r\nlatter? I sent an inquiry, but received no answer. The Provisional\r\nGovernment itself, apparently, had no clear notion of the essence of\r\nits power.\r\n\r\nFor whom should we pray at Divine Service? Should we sing the National\r\nAnthem and \"O God, Save Thy People!\" (a prayer in which the Emperor was\r\nmentioned)?\r\n\r\nThese apparent trifles produced, however, a certain confusion in the\r\nminds of the men and interfered with established military routine. The\r\nCommanding Officers requested that the oath should be taken as soon as\r\npossible. There was also the question whether the Emperor Nicolas had\r\nthe right to abdicate not only for himself, but for his son, who had\r\nnot yet attained his majority.\r\n\r\nOther questions soon began to interest the troops. We received the\r\nfirst Order of the Day of the War Minister, Gutchkov, with alterations\r\nof the Army Regulations in favour of the \"Democratisation of the Army\"\r\n(March 5th). By this Order, inoffensive at first sight, the officers\r\nwere not to be addressed by the men according to their rank, and were\r\nnot to speak to the men in the second person singular. A series of\r\npetty restrictions established by Army Regulations for the men, such\r\nas no smoking in the streets and other public places, no card-playing,\r\nand exclusion from Clubs and Meetings, were removed. The consequences\r\ncame as a surprise to those who were ignorant of the psychology of\r\nthe rank and file. The Commanding Officers understood that if it were\r\nnecessary to do away with certain out-of-date forms the process should\r\nbe gradual and cautious, and should by no means be interpreted as one\r\nof \"the fruits of the Revolutionary victory.\" The bulk of the men did\r\nnot trouble to grasp the meaning of these insignificant changes in the\r\nArmy Regulations, but merely accepted them as a deliverance from the\r\nrestrictions imposed on them by routine and by respect to the Senior\r\nOfficers.\r\n\r\n\"There is liberty, and that's all there is to it.\"\r\n\r\nAll these minor alterations of the Army Regulations, broadly\r\ninterpreted by the men, affected, to a certain degree, the discipline\r\nof the army. But that soldiers should be permitted, during the war\r\nand during the Revolution, to join in the membership of various\r\nUnions and Societies formed for political purposes, was a menace to\r\nthe very existence of the army. G.H.Q., perturbed by this situation,\r\nhad recourse to a measure hitherto unknown in the army--to a kind of\r\nplébiscite. All Commanding Officers, including Regimental Commanders,\r\nwere advised to address direct telegrams to the Minister of War,\r\nexpressing their views on the new orders. I do not know whether the\r\ntelegraph was able to cope with this task and whether the enormous mass\r\nof telegrams reached their destination, but I know that those that came\r\nto my notice were full of criticism and of fears for the future of\r\nthe army. At the same time, the Army Council in Petrograd, consisting\r\nof Senior Generals--the would-be guardians of the experience and\r\ntraditions of the army--decided at a meeting held on March 10th to make\r\nthe following report to the Provisional Government: \"The Army Council\r\ndeems it its duty to declare its full solidarity with the energetic\r\nmeasures contemplated by the Provisional Government in re-modelling our\r\narmed forces in accordance with the new forms of life in the country\r\nand in the army. We are convinced that these reforms will be the best\r\nmeans of achieving rapid victory and the deliverance of Europe from\r\nthe yoke of Prussian militarism.\" I cannot help sympathising with a\r\ncivilian War Minister after such an occurrence. It was difficult for\r\nus to understand the motives by which the War Ministry was guided in\r\nissuing its Orders of the Day. We were unaware of the unrestrained\r\nopportunities of the men who surrounded the War Minister, as well as of\r\nthe fact that the Provisional Government was already dominated by the\r\nSoviet and had entered upon the path of compromise, being invariably\r\non the losing side. At the Congress of the Soviets on March 30th, one\r\nof the speakers stated that in the Conciliation Commission there never\r\nwas a case in which the Provisional Commission did not give way on\r\nimportant matters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON THE FIRST OF MARCH THE SOVIET OF WORKMEN AND SOLDIERS' DELEGATES\r\nISSUED AN ORDER OF THE DAY No. 1., WHICH PRACTICALLY LED TO THE\r\nTRANSFER OF ACTUAL MILITARY POWER TO THE SOLDIERS' COMMITTEES, TO A\r\nSYSTEM OF ELECTIONS AND TO THE DISMISSAL OF COMMANDING OFFICERS BY THE\r\nMEN. THAT ORDER OF THE DAY GAINED WIDE AND PAINFUL NOTORIETY AND GAVE\r\nTHE FIRST IMPETUS TO THE COLLAPSE OF THE ARMY.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _ORDER No. 1._\r\n\r\n    March 1st, 1917.\r\n\r\n    To the Garrison of the Petrograd District, to all Guardsmen,\r\n    soldiers of the line, of the Artillery, and of the Fleet, for\r\n    immediate and strict observance, and to the workmen of Petrograd\r\n    for information.\r\n\r\n    The Soviet of Workmen and Soldiers' Delegates has decreed:\r\n\r\n    (1) That Committees be elected of representatives of the men in\r\n    all companies, battalions, regiments, parks, batteries, squadrons\r\n    and separate services of various military institutions, and on the\r\n    ships of the fleet.\r\n\r\n    (2) All military units not yet represented on the Soviet of\r\n    Workmen's Delegates to elect one representative from each\r\n    company. These representatives to provide themselves with written\r\n    certificates and to report to the Duma at 10 A.M. on March 2nd.\r\n\r\n    (3) In all its political activities the military unit is\r\n    subordinate to the Soviet,[16] and to its Committees.\r\n\r\n    (4) The Orders of the Military Commission of the Duma are to be\r\n    obeyed only when they are not in contradiction with the orders and\r\n    decrees of the Soviet.\r\n\r\n    (5) All arms--rifles, machine-guns, armoured cars, etc.--are to\r\n    be at the disposal and under the control of Company and Battalion\r\n    Committees, and should never be handed over to the officers even\r\n    should they claim them.\r\n\r\n    (6) On parade and on duty the soldiers must comply with strict\r\n    military discipline; but off parade and off duty, in their\r\n    political, social and private life, soldiers must suffer no\r\n    restriction of the rights common to all citizens. In particular,\r\n    saluting when off duty is abolished.\r\n\r\n    (7) Officers are no longer to be addressed as \"Your Excellency,\"\r\n    \"Your Honour,\" etc. Instead, they should be addressed as \"Mr.\r\n    General,\" \"Mr. Colonel,\" etc.\r\n\r\n    Rudeness to soldiers on the part of all ranks, and in particular\r\n    addressing them in the second person singular, is prohibited, and\r\n    any infringement of this regulation and misunderstandings between\r\n    officers and men are to be reported by the latter to the Company\r\n    Commanders.\r\n\r\n                                          (Signed) THE PETROGRAD SOVIET.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the Revolutionary Democracy understood full well\r\nthe results of Order No. 1. Kerensky is reported to have declared\r\nafterwards pathetically that he would have given ten years of his\r\nlife to prevent the Order from being signed. The investigation made\r\nby military authorities failed to detect the authors of this Order.\r\nTchkeidze and other members of the Soviet afterwards denied their\r\npersonal participation and that of the members of the Committee in the\r\ndrafting of the Order.\r\n\r\nPilates! They washed their hands of the writing of their own Credo. For\r\ntheir words are placed on record, in the report of the secret sitting\r\nof the Government, the Commanders-in-Chief and the Executive Committee\r\nof the Workmen and Soldiers' Deputies of May 4th, 1917:\r\n\r\n_Tzeretelli_: You might, perhaps, understand Order No. 1 if you knew\r\nthe circumstances in which it was issued. We were confronted with an\r\nunorganised mob, and we had to organise.\r\n\r\n_Skobelev_: I consider it necessary to explain the circumstances in\r\nwhich Order No. 1. was issued. Among the troops that overthrew the old\r\nrégime, the Commanding Officers did not join the rebels. In order to\r\ndeprive the former of their importance, we were forced to issue Order\r\nNo. 1. We had inward apprehensions as to the attitude of the front\r\ntowards the Revolution. Certain instructions were given, which provoked\r\nour distrust. To-day we have ascertained that this distrust was well\r\nfounded.\r\n\r\nA member of the Soviet, Joseph Goldenberg, Editor of _New Life_,\r\nwas still more outspoken. He said to the French journalist, Claude\r\nAnet: (Claude Anet: _La Révolution Russe_) \"Order No. 1. was not an\r\nerror, but a necessity. It was not drafted by Sokolov. It is the\r\nexpression of the unanimous will of the Soviet. On the day we 'made the\r\nRevolution,' we understood that if we did not dismember the old army,\r\nit would crush the Revolution. We had to choose between the army and\r\nthe Revolution. We did not hesitate--we chose the latter, and I dare\r\nsay that we were right.\"\r\n\r\nOrder No. 1. was disseminated rapidly and everywhere along the whole\r\nfront and in the rear, because the ideas which it embodied had\r\ndeveloped for many years, in the slums of Petrograd as well as in the\r\nremote corners of the Empire, such as Vladivostock. They had been\r\npreached by all local army demagogues and were being repeated by all\r\nthe delegates who visited the front in vast numbers and were provided\r\nwith certificates of immunity by the Soviet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe masses of the soldiery were perturbed. The movement began in\r\nthe rear, always more easily demoralised than the front, among the\r\nhalf-educated clerks, doctors' assistants, and technical units. In\r\nthe latter part of March in our units, breaches of discipline only\r\nbecame more frequent. The officer in command of the Fourth Army was\r\nexpecting every hour that he would be arrested at his Headquarters by\r\nthe licentious bands of men attached to service battalions for special\r\nduty, such as tailoring, cooking, bootmaking, etc.\r\n\r\nThe text of the oath of allegiance to the Russian State was received\r\nat last. The idea of Supreme Power was expressed in these words: \"I\r\nswear to obey the Provisional Government now at the head of the Russian\r\nState, pending the expression of the popular will through the medium of\r\nthe Constituent Assembly.\" The oath was taken by the troops everywhere\r\nwithout any disturbance, but the idyllic hopes of the Commanding\r\nOfficers were not fulfilled. There was no uplifting of the spirit and\r\nthe perturbed minds were not quieted. I may quote two characteristic\r\nepisodes. The Commander of one of the Corps on the Roumanian front\r\ndied of heart-failure during the ceremony. Count Keller declared that\r\nhe would not compel his corps to take the oath because he did not\r\nunderstand the substance and the legal foundations of the Supreme Power\r\nof the Provisional Government. (Replying to a question addressed from\r\nthe crowd as to who had elected the Provisional Government, Miliukov\r\nhad answered: \"We have been elected by the Russian Revolution\"). Count\r\nKeller said he did not understand how one could swear allegiance to\r\nLvov, Kerensky and other individuals, because they could be removed\r\nor relinquish their posts. Was the oath a sham? I think that not only\r\nfor the monarchists, but for many men who did not look upon the oath\r\nas a mere formality, it was in any case a great, moral drama difficult\r\nto live through. It was a heavy sacrifice made for the sake of the\r\ncountry's salvation and for the preservation of the army....\r\n\r\nIn the middle of May I was ordered to attend a Council at the\r\nHeadquarters of the General-in-Command of the Fourth Army. A long\r\ntelegram was read from General Alexeiev full of the darkest possible\r\npessimism, recounting the beginning of the administrative machine and\r\nof the army. He described the demagogic activities of the Soviet,\r\nwhich dominated the will-power and the conscience of the Provisional\r\nGovernment, the complete impotence of the latter and the interference\r\nof both in army administration.\r\n\r\nIn order to counteract the dismemberment of the army, the despatch was\r\ncontemplated of members of the Duma and of the Soviet, possessing a\r\ncertain amount of statesmanlike experience, to the front for purposes\r\nof propaganda....\r\n\r\nThis telegram impressed us all in the same way: _General Headquarters\r\nhad ceased to be the chief administrative authority in the army._\r\nAnd yet a stern warning and remonstrance from the High Command,\r\nsupported by the army, which in the first fortnight had still retained\r\ndiscipline and obedience might, perhaps, have relegated the Soviet,\r\nwhich over-estimated its importance, to its proper place; might have\r\nprevented the \"democratisation\" of the army and might have exercised\r\na corresponding pressure upon the entire course of political events,\r\nalbeit devoid of any character of counter-revolution or of military\r\ndictatorship. The loyalty of the Commanding Officers and the complete\r\nabsence of active resistance on their part to the destructive policy of\r\nPetrograd exceeded all the expectations of the Revolutionary Democracy.\r\n\r\nKornilov's movement came too late.\r\n\r\nWe drafted a reply suggesting stringent measures against intrusion into\r\nthe sphere of military administration. On March 18th I received orders\r\nto proceed forthwith to Petrograd and to report to the War Minister.\r\nI left on the same night and by means of a complex system of carts,\r\nmotor cars and railway carriages arrived in the Capital after five\r\ndays' journey. On my way I passed through the Headquarters of Generals\r\nLetchitski, Kaledin, and Brussilov. I met many officers and many men\r\nconnected with the army. Everywhere I heard the same bitter complaint\r\nand the same request:\r\n\r\n\"Tell _them_ that _they_ are ruining the army.\"\r\n\r\nThe summons I had received gave no indication as to the object of my\r\nerrand. I was completely in the dark and made all kinds of surmises.\r\nIn Kiev I was struck by the cry of a newsboy who ran past. He shouted:\r\n\"Latest news. General Denikin is appointed Chief of the Staff of the\r\nSupreme Commander-in-Chief.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nIMPRESSIONS OF PETROGRAD AT THE END OF MARCH, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore his abdication the Emperor signed two ukazes--appointing Prince\r\nLvov President of the Council of Ministers and the Grand-Duke Nicholas\r\nSupreme Commander-in-Chief. \"In view of the general attitude towards\r\nthe Romanov Dynasty,\" as the official Petrograd papers said, and in\r\nreality for fear of the Soviet's attempting a military _coup d'état_,\r\nthe Grand-Duke Nicholas was informed on March 9th by the Provisional\r\nGovernment that it was undesirable that he should remain in supreme\r\ncommand. Prince Lvov wrote: \"The situation makes your resignation\r\nimperative. Public opinion is definitely and resolutely opposed to any\r\nmembers of the House of Romanov holding any office in the State. The\r\nProvisional Government is not entitled to disregard the voice of the\r\npeople, because such disregard might bring about serious complications.\r\nThe Provisional Government is convinced that, for the good of the\r\ncountry, you will bow to the necessity and will resign before returning\r\nto G.H.Q.\" This letter reached the Grand-Duke when he had already\r\narrived at G.H.Q. Deeply offended, he immediately handed over to\r\nGeneral Alexeiev and replied to the Government: \"I am glad once more\r\nto prove my love for my country, which Russia _heretofore_ has never\r\ndoubted....\"\r\n\r\nThe very serious question then arose of who was to succeed him.\r\nThere was great excitement at G.H.Q., and all sorts of rumours were\r\ncirculated, but on the day I passed Mohilev nothing was known. On the\r\n23rd I reported to the War Minister Gutchkov, whom I had never met\r\nbefore. He informed me that the Government had decided to appoint\r\nGeneral Alexeiev to the Supreme Command. At first there had been\r\ndifferences of opinion. Rodzianko and others were against Alexeiev.\r\nRodzianko suggested Brussilov; but now the choice had definitely\r\nfallen on Alexeiev. The Government considered him as a man of lenient\r\ndisposition, and deemed it necessary to reinforce the Supreme Command\r\nby a fighting general as Chief-of-Staff. I had been selected on\r\ncondition that General Klembovski, who was then Alexeiev's assistant,\r\nshould remain in charge _pro tem._ until I became familiar with\r\nthe work. I had been, in part, prepared for this offer by the news\r\ncolumns of the Kiev paper. Nevertheless, I felt a certain emotion, and\r\napprehended the vast amount of work which was being thrust upon me so\r\nunexpectedly and the tremendous moral responsibility inherent in such\r\nan appointment. At great length and quite sincerely I adduced arguments\r\nagainst the appointment. I said that my career had been spent among my\r\nmen and at Fighting Headquarters, that during the war I had commanded\r\na division and an army corps, and that I was very anxious to continue\r\nthis work at the front. I said that I had never dealt with matters of\r\npolicy, of national defence, or of administration on such a colossal\r\nscale. The appointment, moreover, had an unpleasant feature. It appears\r\nthat Gutchkov had quite frankly explained to Alexeiev the reasons\r\nfor my appointment on behalf of the Provisional Government, and had\r\ngiven the matter the character of an ultimatum. A grave complication\r\nhad thus arisen. A Chief-of-Staff was being imposed upon the Supreme\r\nC.-in-C., and for motives not altogether complimentary to the latter.\r\nMy arguments, however, were unavailing. I succeeded in obtaining a\r\ndelay and the privilege of discussing the matter with General Alexeiev\r\nbefore taking a definite decision. In the War Minister's office I\r\nmet my colleague, General Krymov, and we were both present while the\r\nMinister's assistants reported on uninteresting matters of routine. We\r\nthen retired into the next room and began to talk frankly.\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake,\" said Krymov, \"don't refuse the appointment. It is\r\nabsolutely necessary.\"\r\n\r\nHe imparted to me his impressions in abrupt sentences in his own\r\npeculiar and somewhat rough language, but with all his usual sincerity.\r\nHe had arrived on March 14th, summoned by Gutchkov, with whom he had\r\nbeen on friendly terms, and they had worked together. He was offered\r\nseveral prominent posts, had asked leave to look round, and then\r\nhad refused them all. \"I saw that there was nothing for me to do in\r\nPetrograd, and I disliked it all.\" He particularly disliked the men who\r\nsurrounded Gutchkov.\r\n\r\n\"I am leaving Colonel Samarine, of the General Staff, as a Liaison\r\nOfficer. There will be at least one live man.\"\r\n\r\nBy the irony of fate that officer whom Krymov trusted so well\r\nafterwards played a fatal part, as he was the indirect cause of the\r\nGeneral's suicide.... Krymov was very pessimistic in his account of the\r\npolitical situation:\r\n\r\n\"Nothing will come of it in any case. How can business be done when\r\nthe Soviet and the licentious soldiery hold the Government pinioned?\r\nI offered to cleanse Petrograd in two days with one division; but,\r\nof course, not without bloodshed. 'Not for anything in the world,'\r\nthey said. Gutchkov refused. Prince Lvov, with a gesture of despair,\r\nexclaimed: 'Oh! but there would be such a commotion!' Things will get\r\nworse. One of these days I shall go back to my army corps. I cannot\r\nafford to lose touch with the troops, as it is upon them that I base\r\nall my hopes. My corps maintains complete order and, perhaps, I shall\r\nsucceed in preserving that spirit.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI had not seen Petrograd for four years. The impression produced by the\r\nCapital was painful and strange.... To begin with, the Hotel Astoria,\r\nwhere I stayed, had been ransacked. In the hall there was a guard\r\nof rough and undisciplined sailors of the Guards. The streets were\r\ncrowded, but dirty and filled with the new masters of the situation\r\nin khaki overcoats. Remote from the sufferings of the front, they\r\nwere \"deepening and saving\" the Revolution. From whom? I had read a\r\ngreat deal about the enthusiasm in Petrograd, but I found none. It\r\nwas nowhere to be seen. The ministers and rulers were pale, haggard,\r\nexhausted by sleepless nights and endless speeches at meetings and\r\ncouncils, by addresses to various delegations and to the mob. Their\r\nexcitement was artificial, their oratory was full of sonorous phrases\r\nand commonplaces, of which the orators themselves were presumably\r\nthoroughly sick. Inwardly in their heart of hearts they were deeply\r\nanxious. No practical work was being done; in fact, the ministers had\r\nno time to concentrate their thoughts upon the current affairs of\r\nState in their departments. The old bureaucratic machine, creaking and\r\ngroaning, continued to work in a haphazard manner. The old wheels were\r\nstill revolving while a new handle was being applied.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the regular army felt themselves to be stepsons of\r\nthe Revolution and were unable to hit upon a proper tone in dealing\r\nwith the men. Among the higher ranks, and especially the officers of\r\nthe General Staff, there appeared already a new type of opportunist\r\nand demagogue. These men played upon the weaknesses of the Soviet and\r\nof the new governing class of workmen and soldiers, to flatter the\r\ninstincts of the crowd, thereby gaining their confidence and making new\r\nopenings for themselves and for their careers against the background\r\nof revolutionary turmoil. I must, however, admit that in those days\r\nthe military circles proved sufficiently stolid in spite of all the\r\nefforts to dismember them, and that the seeds of demoralisation were\r\nnot allowed to grow. Men of the type described above, such as the young\r\nassistant of the War Minister, Kerensky, as well as Generals Brussilov,\r\nCheremissov, Bonch-Bruevitch, Verkhovsky, Admiral Maximov and others\r\nwere unable to strengthen their influence and their position with the\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nThe citizen of Petrograd, in the broadest sense of the word, was by no\r\nmeans enthusiastic. The first enthusiasm was exhausted and was followed\r\nby anxiety and indecision.\r\n\r\nAnother feature of the life in Petrograd deserves to be noticed. Men\r\nhave ceased to be themselves. Most of them seem to be acting a part\r\ninstead of living a life inspired by the new breath of revolution.\r\nSuch was the case even in the Councils of the Provisional Government,\r\nin which the deliberations were not altogether sincere, so I was\r\ntold, owing to the presence of Kerensky, the \"hostage of democracy.\"\r\nTactical considerations, caution, partisanship, anxiety for one's\r\ncareer, feelings of self-preservation, nervousness and various\r\nother good and bad feelings prompted men to wear blinkers and to\r\nwalk about in these blinkers as apologists for, or at least passive\r\nwitnesses of, \"the conquests of the Revolution.\" Such conquests as\r\nobviously savoured of death and corruption. Hence the false pathos\r\nof endless speeches and meetings; hence these seemingly strange\r\ncontradictions. Prince Lvov saying in a public speech: \"The process\r\nof the great Russian Revolution is not yet complete, but every day\r\nstrengthens our faith in the inexhaustible creative forces of the\r\nRussian people, in its statesmanlike wisdom and in the greatness of\r\nits soul.\"... The same Prince Lvov bitterly complaining to Alexeiev\r\nof the impossible conditions under which the Provisional Government\r\nwas working, owing to the rapid growth of demagogy in the Soviet\r\nand in the country. Kerensky, the exponent of the idea of Soldiers'\r\nCommittees, and Kerensky sitting in his railway carriage and nervously\r\nwhispering to his adjutant: \"Send these d.... committees to h....\"\r\nTchkheidze and Skobelev warmly advocating full democratisation of the\r\narmy at a joint sitting of the Soviet, of the Government and of the\r\nCommanders-in-Chief, and during an interval in private conversation\r\nadmitting the necessity of rigid military discipline and of their own\r\nincapacity to convince the Soviet of this necessity....\r\n\r\nI repeat that even then, at the end of March, one could clearly feel\r\nin Petrograd that the ringing of the Easter bells had lasted too long,\r\nand that they would have done better to ring the alarm bell. There were\r\nonly two men of all those to whom I had the occasion to speak who had\r\nno illusions whatever: Krymov and Kornilov.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI met Kornilov for the first time on the Galician plains, near Galtich,\r\nat the end of August, 1914, when he was appointed to the Command of\r\nthe 48th Infantry Division and myself to the 4th (Iron) Rifle Brigade.\r\nSince that day, for four months, our troops went forward side by side\r\nas part of the 14th Corps, fighting incessant, glorious and heavy\r\nbattles, defeating the enemy, crossing the Carpathians and invading\r\nHungary. Owing to the wide extent of the front we did not often meet;\r\nnevertheless, we knew each other very well. I had already then a clear\r\nperception of Kornilov's main characteristics as a leader. He had an\r\nextraordinary capacity for training troops: out of a second-rate unit\r\nfrom the district of Kazan he made, in several weeks, an excellent\r\nfighting division. He was resolute and extremely pertinacious in\r\nconducting the most difficult and even apparently doomed operations.\r\nHis personal prowess, which provoked boundless admiration and gave\r\nhim great popularity among the troops, was admirable. Finally, he\r\nscrupulously observed military ethics with regard to units fighting\r\nby his side and to his comrades-in-arms. Many commanding officers\r\nand units lacked that quality. After Kornilov's astounding escape\r\nfrom Austrian captivity, into which he fell when heavily wounded,\r\nand covering Brussilov's retreat from the Carpathians, towards the\r\nbeginning of the Revolution, he commanded the 25th Corps. All those\r\nwho knew Kornilov even slightly felt that he was destined to play\r\nan important part in the Russian Revolution. On March 2nd Rodzianko\r\ntelegraphed direct to Kornilov: \"The Temporary Committee of the Duma\r\nrequests you, for your country's sake, to accept the chief command\r\nin Petrograd and to arrive at the Capital at once. We have no doubt\r\nthat you will not refuse the appointment, and will thereby render an\r\ninestimable service to the country.\" Such a revolutionary method of\r\nappointing an officer to a high command, without reference to G.H.Q.,\r\nobviously produced a bad impression at the \"Stavka.\" The telegram\r\nreceived at the \"Stavka\" is marked \"Undelivered,\" but on the same day\r\nGeneral Alexeiev, having requested the permission of the Emperor, who\r\nwas then at Pskov, issued an order of the day (No. 334): \"... I agree\r\nto General Kornilov being in temporary high command of the troops of\r\nthe Petrograd Military District.\"\r\n\r\nI have mentioned this insignificant episode in order to explain the\r\nsomewhat abnormal relations between two prominent leaders, which were\r\noccasioned by repeated, petty, personal friction.\r\n\r\nI talked to Kornilov at dinner in the War Minister's house. It was the\r\nonly moment of rest he could snatch during the day. Kornilov, tired,\r\nmorose and somewhat pessimistic, discussed at length the conditions\r\nof the Petrograd Garrison, and his intercourse with the Soviet. The\r\nhero-worship with which he had been surrounded in the army had faded in\r\nthe unhealthy atmosphere of the Capital among the demoralised troops.\r\nThey were holding meetings, deserting, indulging in petty commerce\r\nin shops and in the street, serving as hall-porters and as personal\r\nguards to private individuals, partaking in plundering and arbitrary\r\nsearches, but were not serving. It was difficult for a fighting general\r\nto understand their psychology. He often succeeded by personal pluck,\r\ndisregard of danger, and by a witty, picturesque word in holding the\r\nmob, for that was what military units were. There were, however,\r\ncases when the troops did not come out of barracks to meet their\r\nCommander-in-Chief, when he was hissed and the flag of St. George was\r\ntorn from his motor-car (by the Finland Regiment of the Guards).\r\n\r\nKornilov's description of the political situation was the same as that\r\ngiven by Krymov: Powerlessness of the Government and the inevitability\r\nof a fierce cleansing of Petrograd. On one point they differed:\r\nKornilov stubbornly clung to the hope that he would yet succeed in\r\ngaining authority over the majority of the Petrograd Garrison. As we\r\nknow, that hope was never fulfilled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE STAVKA: ITS RÔLE AND POSITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn March 25th I arrived at the Stavka, and was immediately received\r\nby General Alexeiev. Of course he was offended. \"Well,\" he said, \"if\r\nsuch are the orders, what's to be done?\" Again, as at the War Ministry,\r\nI pointed out several reasons against my appointment, among others,\r\nmy disinclination for Staff work. I asked the General to express his\r\nviews quite frankly, and in disregard of all conventionalities as my\r\nold Professor, because I would not think of accepting the appointment\r\nagainst his will. Alexeiev spoke politely, dryly, evasively, and\r\nshowed again that he was offended. \"The scope,\" he said, \"was wide,\r\nwork difficult, and much training necessary. Let us, however, work\r\nharmoniously.\" In the course of my long career I have never been placed\r\nin such a position, and could not, of course, be reconciled to such an\r\nattitude. \"In these circumstances,\" I said, \"I absolutely refuse to\r\naccept the appointment. In order to avoid friction between yourself\r\nand the Government, I will declare that it is entirely my own personal\r\ndecision.\"\r\n\r\nAlexeiev's tone changed immediately. \"Oh! no,\" he said, \"I am not\r\nasking you to refuse. Let us work together, and I will help you. Also,\r\nthere is no reason, if you feel that the work is not to your liking,\r\nwhy you should not take command of the First Army, in which there will\r\nbe a vacancy two or three months hence. I will have to talk the matter\r\nover with General Klembovski. He could not, of course, remain here as\r\nmy assistant.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: General Alexeiev.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: General Kornilov.]\r\n\r\nOur parting was not quite so frigid; but a couple of days went by and\r\nthere were no results. I lived in a railway carriage, and did not go to\r\nthe office or to the mess. As I did not intend to tolerate this silly\r\nand utterly undeserved position, I was preparing to leave Petrograd.\r\nOn March 28th the War Minister came to the Stavka and cut the Gordian\r\nknot. Klembovski was offered the command of an army or membership of\r\nthe War Council. He chose the latter, and on April 5th I took charge\r\nas Chief of the Staff. Nevertheless, such a method of appointing the\r\nclosest assistant to the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, practically by\r\nforce, could not but leave a certain trace. A kind of shadow seemed\r\nto lie between myself and General Alexeiev, and it did not disappear\r\nuntil the last stage of his tenure of office. Alexeiev saw in my\r\nappointment a kind of tutelage on the part of the Government. From the\r\nvery first moment I was compelled to oppose Petrograd. I served our\r\ncause and tried to shield the Supreme C.-in-C.--and of this he was\r\noften unaware--from many conflicts and much friction, taking them upon\r\nmyself. As time went by friendly relations of complete mutual trust\r\nwere established, and these did not cease until the day of Alexeiev's\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nOn April 2nd the General received the following telegram: \"The\r\nProvisional Government has appointed you Supreme Commander-in-Chief.\r\nIt trusts that, under your firm guidance, the Army and the Navy will\r\nfulfil their duty to the country to the end.\" My appointment was\r\ngazetted on April 10th.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Stavka, on the whole was not favoured. In the circles of the\r\nRevolutionary Democracy it was considered a nest of counter-Revolution,\r\nalthough such a description was utterly undeserved. Under Alexeiev\r\nthere was a loyal struggle against the disruption of the Army. Under\r\nBrussilov--opportunism slightly tainted with subservience to the\r\nRevolutionary Democracy. As regards the Kornilov movement, although it\r\nwas not essentially counter-Revolutionary, it aimed, as we shall see\r\nlater, at combatting the Soviets that were half-Bolshevik. But, even\r\nthen, the loyalty of the officers of the Stavka was quite obvious. Only\r\na few of them took an active part in the Kornilov movement. After the\r\noffice of Supreme Commander-in-Chief was abolished, and the new office\r\ncreated of Supreme Commanding Committees, nearly all the members of\r\nthe Stavka under Kerensky, and the majority of them under Krylenko,\r\ncontinued to carry on the routine work. The Army also disliked the\r\nStavka--sometimes wrongly, sometimes rightly--because the Army did\r\nnot quite understand the distribution of functions among the various\r\nbranches of the Service, and ascribed to the Stavka many shortcomings\r\nin equipment, organisation, promotion, awards, etc., whereas these\r\nquestions belonged entirely to the War Ministry and its subordinates.\r\nThe Stavka had always been somewhat out of touch with the Army. Under\r\nthe comparatively normal and smoothly working conditions of the\r\npre-Revolutionary period this circumstance did not greatly prejudice\r\nthe working of the ruling mechanism; but now, when the Army was not\r\nin a normal condition, and had been affected by the whirlwind of the\r\nRevolution, the Stavka naturally was behind the times.\r\n\r\nFinally, a certain amount of friction could not fail to arise between\r\nthe Government and the Stavka, because the latter constantly protested\r\nagainst many Government measures, which exercised a disturbing\r\ninfluence on the Army. There were no other serious reasons for\r\ndifference of opinion, because neither Alexeiev nor myself, nor the\r\nvarious sections of the Stavka, ever touched upon matters of internal\r\npolicy. The Stavka was non-political in the fullest sense of the word,\r\nand during the first months of the Revolution was a perfectly reliable\r\ntechnical apparatus in the hands of the Provisional Government. The\r\nStavka did but safeguard the highest interests of the Army, and, within\r\nthe limits of the War and of the Army, demanded that full powers be\r\ngiven to the Supreme Commander-in-Chief. I may even say that the\r\npersonnel of the Stavka seemed to me to be bureaucratic and too deeply\r\nimmersed in the sphere of purely technical interests; they were not\r\nsufficiently interested in the political and social questions which\r\nevents had brought to the fore.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn discussing the Russian strategy in the Great War, after August,\r\n1915, one should always bear in mind that it was the personal\r\nstrategy of General Alexeiev. He alone bears the responsibility\r\nbefore history for its course, its successes and failures. A man of\r\nexceptional conscientiousness and self-sacrifice, and devoted to\r\nhis work, he had one serious failing: all his life he did the work\r\nof others as well as his own. So it was when he held the post of\r\nQuartermaster-General of the General Staff, of Chief-of-Staff of the\r\nKiev District, and later of the South-Western front and finally of\r\nChief-of-Staff to the Supreme C.-in-C. Nobody influenced strategical\r\ndecisions, and, as often as not, final instructions, written in\r\nAlexeiev's tiny and neat hand-writing, appeared unexpectedly on\r\nthe desk of the Quartermaster-General, whose duty under the law\r\nand whose responsibility in these matters were very grave. If such\r\na procedure was to a certain extent justifiable, when the post of\r\nQuartermaster-General was occupied by a nonentity, there was no excuse\r\nfor it when he was superseded by other Quartermasters-General, such as\r\nLukomski or Josephovitch. These men could not accept such a position.\r\nThe former, as a rule, protested by sending in memoranda embodying his\r\nopinion, which was adverse to the plan of operations. Such protests,\r\nof course, were purely academic, but presented a guarantee against\r\nthe judgment of history. General Klembovski, my predecessor, was\r\ncompelled to demand non-interference with the rightful sphere of his\r\ncompetence as a condition of his tenure of office. Till then, Alexeiev\r\nhad directed all the branches of administration. When these branches\r\nacquired a still broader scope, this proved practically impossible,\r\nand I was given full liberty in my work except ... in respect of\r\nstrategy. Again, Alexeiev began to send telegrams in his own hand of\r\na strategical nature, orders and directions, the motives of which the\r\nQuartermaster-General and myself could not understand. Several times,\r\nthree of us, the Quartermaster-General, Josephovitch, his assistant,\r\nGeneral Markov, and myself, discussed this question. The quick-tempered\r\nJosephovitch was greatly excited, and asked to be appointed to a\r\nDivisional Command. \"I cannot be a clerk,\" he said. \"There is no need\r\nfor a Quartermaster-General at the Stavka if every clerk can type\r\ninstructions.\" The General and myself began to contemplate resignation.\r\nMarkov said that he would not stay for a single day if we went. I\r\nfinally decided to have a frank talk with Alexeiev. We were both under\r\nthe strain of emotion. We parted as friends, but we did not settle the\r\nquestion. Alexeiev said: \"Do I not give you a full share of the work? I\r\ndo not understand you.\" Alexeiev was quite sincerely surprised because\r\nduring the war he had grown accustomed to a régime which appeared to\r\nhim perfectly normal. So we three held another conference. After a\r\nlengthy discussion, we decided that the plan of campaign for 1917 had\r\nlong since been worked out, that preparations for that campaign had\r\nreached a stage in which substantial alterations had become impossible,\r\nthat the details of the concentration and distribution of troops were\r\nin the present condition of the Army a difficult matter, allowing for\r\ndifferences of opinion; that we could perhaps manage to effect certain\r\nalterations of the plan, and that finally our retirement _in corpore_\r\nmight be detrimental to the work, and might undermine the position\r\nof the Supreme C.-in-C., which was already by no means stable. We\r\ntherefore decided to wait and see. We did not have to wait very long,\r\nbecause, at the end of May, Alexeiev left the Stavka, and we followed\r\nhim very soon afterwards.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat place did the Stavka occupy as a military and political factor of\r\nthe Revolutionary period?\r\n\r\nThe importance of the Stavka diminished. In the days of the Imperial\r\nrégime, the Stavka, from the military point of view, occupied a\r\npredominant position. No individual or institution in the State was\r\nentitled to issue instructions or to call to account the Supreme\r\nCommander-in-Chief, and it was Alexeiev and not the Czar who in reality\r\nheld that office. Not a single measure of the War Ministry, even if\r\nindirectly affecting the interests of the Army, could be adopted\r\nwithout the sanction of the Stavka. The Stavka gave direct orders to\r\nthe War Minister and to his Department on questions appertaining to\r\nthe care of the Army. The voice of the Stavka had a certain weight\r\nand importance in the practical domain of administration at the\r\ntheatre of war, albeit without any connection with the general trend\r\nof internal policy. That power was not exercised to a sufficient\r\ndegree; but on principle it afforded the opportunity of carrying on\r\nthe defence of the country in co-operation with other branches of the\r\nadministration, which were to a certain extent subordinate to it. With\r\nthe beginning of the Revolution, these conditions underwent a radical\r\nchange. Contrary to the examples of history and to the dictates of\r\nmilitary science, the Stavka became practically subordinate to the War\r\nMinister. This was not due to any act of the Government, but merely to\r\nthe fact that the Provisional Government combined supreme power with\r\nexecutive power, as well as to the combination of the strong character\r\nof Gutchkov and the yielding nature of Alexeiev. The Stavka could no\r\nlonger address rightful demands to the branches of the War Ministry\r\nwhich were attending to Army equipments. It conducted a lengthy\r\ncorrespondence and appealed to the Ministry of War. The War Minister,\r\nwho now signed orders instead of the Emperor, exercised a strong\r\ninfluence upon appointments and dismissals of officers in High Command.\r\nThese appointments were sometimes made by him after consultation with\r\nthe fronts, but the Stavka was not informed. Army regulations of the\r\nhighest importance altering the conditions of the troops in respect of\r\nreinforcements, routine and duty, were issued by the Ministry without\r\nthe participation of the Supreme Command, which learnt of their issue\r\nonly from the Press. In fact, such a participation would have actually\r\nbeen useless. Two products of the Polivanov Commission--the new Courts\r\nand the Committees--which Gutchkov _accidentally_ asked me to look\r\nthrough, were returned with a series of substantial objections of my\r\nown, and Gutchkov expounded them in vain before the representatives of\r\nthe Soviet. The only result was that certain changes in the drafting of\r\nthe regulations were made.\r\n\r\nAll these circumstances undoubtedly undermined the authority of the\r\nStavka in the eyes of the Army, and prompted the Generals in High\r\nCommand to approach the more powerful Central Government Departments\r\nwithout reference to the Stavka, as well as to display excessive\r\nindividual initiative in matters of paramount importance to the\r\nState and to the Army. Thus, in May, 1917, on the Northern Front,\r\nall the pre-War soldiers were discharged instead of the prescribed\r\npercentage, and this created grave difficulties on other fronts. On\r\nthe South-Western Front Ukranian units were being formed. The Admiral\r\nin command of the Baltic Fleet ordered the officers to remove their\r\nshoulder-straps, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Stavka had lost influence and power, and could no longer occupy\r\nthe commanding position of an administrative and moral centre. This\r\noccurred at the most terrible stage of the World War, when the Army\r\nwas beginning to disintegrate, and when not only the entire strength\r\nof the people was being put to the test, but the necessity had arisen\r\nfor a power exceptionally strong and wide in its bearing. Meanwhile,\r\nthe matter was quite obvious: if Alexeiev and Denikin did not enjoy the\r\nconfidence of the Government, and were considered inadequate to the\r\nrequirements of the Supreme Command, they should have been superseded\r\nby new men who did enjoy that confidence and who should have been\r\ninvested with full powers. As a matter of fact, changes were made\r\ntwice. But only the men were changed, not the principles of the High\r\nCommand. In the circumstances, when no one actually wielded power,\r\nmilitary power was not centred in anybody's hands. Neither the Chiefs\r\nwho enjoyed the reputation of serving their country loyally and with\r\nexceptional devotion, like Alexeiev, and later the \"Iron Chiefs,\" such\r\nas Kornilov undoubtedly was and as Brussilov was supposed to be, nor\r\nall the Chameleons that fed from the hand of the Socialist reformers of\r\nthe Army had any real power.\r\n\r\nThe entire military hierarchy was shaken to its very foundations,\r\nthough it retained all the attributes of power and the customary\r\nroutine--instructions which could not move the Armies, orders that were\r\nnever carried out, verdicts of the Courts which were derided. The full\r\nweight of oppression, following the line of the least resistance, fell\r\nsolely upon the loyal commanding officers, who submitted without a\r\nmurmur to persecution from above as well as from below. The Government\r\nand the War Ministry, having abolished repressions, had recourse to\r\na new method of influencing the masses--to _appeals_. Appeals to\r\nthe people, to the Army, to the Cossacks, to everybody, flooded the\r\ncountry, inviting all to do their duty. Unfortunately, only those\r\nappeals were successful that flattered the meanest instincts of\r\nthe mob, inviting it to neglect its duty. As a result, it was not\r\ncounter-Revolution, Buonapartism, or adventure, but the elemental\r\ndesire of the circles where the ideas of statesmanship still prevailed,\r\nto restore the broken laws of warfare, that soon gave rise to a new\r\nwatchword:\r\n\r\n    \"_Military power must be seized_.\"\r\n\r\nSuch a task was not congenial to Alexeiev or Brussilov. Kornilov\r\nsubsequently endeavoured to undertake it, and began independently\r\nto carry out a series of important military measures and to address\r\nultimatums on military questions to the Government. At first, the only\r\nquestion raised was that of granting \"full powers\" to the Supreme\r\nCommand within the scope of its competence.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to compare this state of affairs with that of the\r\ncommand of the armies of our powerful foe. Ludendorff, the first\r\nQuartermaster-General of the German Army says (_Mes Souvenirs de\r\nGuerre_): \"In peace-time the Imperial Government exercised full power\r\nover its Departments.... When the War began the Ministers found it\r\ndifficult to get used to seeing in G.H.Q. a power which was compelled,\r\nby the immensity of its task, to act with greater resolution as that\r\nresolution weakened in Berlin. Would that the Government could clearly\r\nhave perceived this simple truth.... The Government went its own way,\r\nand never abandoned any of its designs in compliance with the wishes\r\nof G.H.Q. On the contrary, it disregarded much that we considered\r\nnecessary for the prosecution of the War.\"\r\n\r\nIf we recall that in March, 1918, the deputy of the Reichstag, Haase,\r\nwas more than justified in saying that the Chancellor was nothing but\r\na figure-head covering the military party, and that Ludendorff was\r\nactually governing the country, we will understand the extent of the\r\npower which the German Command deemed it necessary to exercise in order\r\nto win the World War.\r\n\r\nI have drawn a general picture of the Stavka, such as it was when\r\nI took charge as Chief-of-Staff. Taking the entire position into\r\nconsideration, I had two main objects in view: first, to counteract\r\nwith all my strength the influences which were disrupting the Army, so\r\nas to preserve that Army and to hold the Eastern Front in the world\r\nstruggle; and secondly, to reinforce the rights, the power, and the\r\nauthority of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief. A loyal struggle was at\r\nhand. In that struggle, which only lasted two months, all sections of\r\nthe Stavka had their share.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: General Markov.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nGENERAL MARKOV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe duties of the Quartermaster-General in the Stavka were many-sided\r\nand complex. As in the European Army, it proved therefore necessary to\r\ncreate the office of a second Quartermaster-General. The first dealt\r\nmerely with matters concerning the conduct of operations. I invited\r\nGeneral Markov to accept this new office. His fate was linked up with\r\nmine until his glorious death at the head of a Volunteer Division.\r\nThat Division afterwards bore with honour his name, which has become\r\nlegendary in the Volunteer Army. At the outbreak of war he was a\r\nlecturer at the Academy of the General Staff. He went to the war as\r\nStaff-Officer to General Alexeiev. Then he joined the 19th Division,\r\nand in December, 1914, he served under my command as Chief-of-Staff\r\nof the 4th Rifle Brigade, which I then commanded. When he came to our\r\nBrigade he was unknown and unexpected, as I had asked the Army G.H.Q.\r\nfor another man to be appointed. Immediately upon his arrival he told\r\nme that he had recently undergone a slight operation, was not feeling\r\nwell, was unable to ride, and would not go up to the front line. I\r\nfrowned, and the Staff exchanged significant glances. The \"Professor,\"\r\nas we afterwards often called him as a friendly jest, was obviously out\r\nof place in our midst.\r\n\r\nI started one day with my staff, all mounted, towards the line where\r\nmy riflemen were fiercely fighting, near the town of Friestach. The\r\nenemy was upon us, and the fire was intense. Suddenly, repeated showers\r\nof shrapnel came down upon us. We wondered what it meant, and there\r\nwas Markov gaily smiling, openly driving to the firing line in a huge\r\ncarriage. \"I was bored staying in, so I have come to see what is going\r\non here.\"\r\n\r\nFrom that day the ice was broken, and Markov assumed a proper place in\r\nthe family of the \"Iron Division.\" I have never met a man who loved\r\nmilitary work to such an extent as Markov. He was young (when he was\r\nkilled in the summer of 1918 in action he was only 39 years of age),\r\nimpetuous, communicative, eloquent. He knew how to approach, and\r\nclosely, too, any _milieu_--officers, soldiers, crowds--sometimes far\r\nfrom sympathetic, and how to instil into them his straightforward,\r\nclear, and indisputable articles of faith. He was very quick to grasp\r\nthe situation in battle, and made work much easier for me. Markov had\r\none peculiarity. He was quite exceptionally straightforward, frank,\r\nand abrupt when attacking those who, in his opinion, did not display\r\nadequate knowledge, energy, or pluck. While he was at Headquarters\r\nthe troops therefore viewed him (as in the Brigade) with a certain\r\nreserve, and sometimes even with intolerance (as in the Rostov period\r\nof the Volunteer Army). No sooner, however, did Markov join the\r\nDivision than the attitude towards him became one of love on the part\r\nof the riflemen, or even enthusiasm on the part of the Volunteers.\r\nThe Army had its own psychology. It would have no abruptness and\r\nblame from Markov as a Staff Officer. But when _their_ Markov, in his\r\nusual short fur coat with his cap at the back of his head, waving\r\nhis inevitable whip, was in the rifleman's firing line, under the\r\nhot fire of the enemy, he could be as violent as possible, he could\r\nshout and swear--his words provoked sometimes sorrow, sometimes mirth,\r\nbut there was always a sincere desire to be worthy of his praise. I\r\nrecall the heavy days which the Brigade endured in February, 1915.\r\nThe Brigade was pushed forward, was surrounded by a semi-circle of\r\nhills occupied by the enemy, who was in a position to snipe us. The\r\nposition was intolerable, the losses were heavy, and nothing could be\r\ngained by keeping us on that line. But the 14th Infantry Division next\r\nto us reported to the Army H.Q.: \"Our blood runs cold at the thought\r\nof abandoning the position and having afterwards once more to attack\r\nthe heights which have already cost us rivers of blood.\" I remained.\r\nMatters, however, were so serious that one had to be in close touch\r\nwith the men. I moved the field H.Q. up to the position. Count Keller,\r\nin command of our section, having travelled for eleven hours in deep\r\nmud and over mountain paths, arrived at that moment, and rested for a\r\nwhile.\r\n\r\n\"Let us now drive up to the line.\"\r\n\r\nWe laughed.\r\n\r\n\"How shall we drive? Would you come to the door, enemy machine-guns\r\npermitting?\"\r\n\r\nCount Keller left fully determined to extricate the Brigade from the\r\ntrap. The Brigade was melting away. In the rear there was only one\r\nramshackle bridge across the San. We were in the hands of fate. Will\r\nthe torrent swell? If it does, the bridge will be swept away, and\r\nour retreat will be cut off. At this difficult moment the Colonel in\r\ncommand of the 13th Rifle Regiment was severely wounded by a sniper\r\nas he was coming out of the house where the H.Q. were stationed. All\r\nofficers of his rank having been killed, there was nobody to replace\r\nhim. I was pacing up and down the small hut, in a gloomy mood. Markov\r\nrose.\r\n\r\n\"Give me the 13th Regiment, sir,\" said Markov.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, with pleasure.\"\r\n\r\nI had already thought of doing so. But I hesitated to offer it to\r\nMarkov lest he should think it was my intention to remove him from the\r\nStaff. Markov afterwards went with his regiment from one victory to\r\nanother. He had already earned the Cross of St. George and the sword\r\nof St. George, but for nine months the Stavka would not confirm his\r\nappointment, because he had not reached the dead line of seniority.\r\n\r\nI recall the days of the heavy Galician retreat, when a tidal wave\r\nof maddened peasants, with women, children, cattle and carts, was\r\nfollowing the Army, burning their villages and houses.... Markov was in\r\nthe rear, and was ordered promptly to blow up the bridge at which this\r\nhuman tide had stopped. He was, however, moved by the sufferings of the\r\npeople, and for six hours he fought for the bridge at the risk of being\r\ncut off, until the last cart of the refugees had crossed the bridge.\r\n\r\nHis life was a perpetual fiery impulse. On one occasion I had lost\r\nall hope of ever seeing him again. In the beginning of September,\r\n1915, in the course of the Lutsk operation, in which our Division\r\nso distinguished itself, between Olyka and Klevan, the left column\r\ncommanded by Markov broke the Austrian line and disappeared. The\r\nAustrians closed the line. During the day we heard no news, and the\r\nnight came. I was anxious for the fate of the 13th Regiment, and rode\r\nto a high slope, observing the enemy's firing line in the silent\r\ndistance. Suddenly, from afar, from the dense forest, in the far rear\r\nof the Austrians, I heard the joyous strains of the Regimental March of\r\nthe 13th. What a relief it was!\r\n\r\n\"I got into such a fix,\" said Markov afterwards, \"the devil himself\r\ncould not have known which were my riflemen and which were Austrians. I\r\ndecided to cheer up my men and to collect them by making the band play.\"\r\n\r\nMarkov's column had smashed the enemy, had taken two thousand prisoners\r\nand a gun, and had put the Austrians to disorderly flight towards\r\nLutsk.\r\n\r\nIn his impulsiveness he sometimes went from one extreme to another,\r\nbut, as soon as matters grew really desperate, he immediately regained\r\nself-possession. In October, 1915, the 4th Rifle Division was\r\nconducting the famous Chartoriisk operation, had broken the enemy on a\r\nfront about twelve miles wide and over fifteen miles deep. Brussilov,\r\nhaving no reserves, hesitated to bring up troops from another front\r\nin order to take advantage of this break. Time was short. The Germans\r\ncentred their reserves, and they were attacking me on all sides. The\r\nsituation was difficult. Markov, from the front line, telephoned: \"The\r\nposition is peculiar. I am fighting the four quarters of the earth. It\r\nis so hard as to be thoroughly amusing.\" Only once did I see him in a\r\nstate of utter depression, when, in the spring of 1915, near Przemyshl,\r\nhe was removing from the firing line the remnants of his companies. He\r\nwas drenched with the blood of the C.O. of the 14th Regiment, who had\r\nbeen standing by, and whose head had been torn off by a shell.\r\n\r\nMarkov never took any personal precautions. In September, 1915, the\r\nDivision was fighting in the direction of Kovel. On the right our\r\ncavalry was operating, was moving forward irresolutely, and was\r\nperturbing us by incredible news of the appearance of important enemy\r\nforces on its front, on our bank of the River Styr. Markov became\r\nannoyed with this indecision, and reported to me: \"I went to the Styr\r\nwith my orderly to give the horses a drink. Between our line and the\r\nStyr there is no one, neither our cavalry nor the enemy.\"\r\n\r\nI reported him for promotion to General's rank, as a reward for several\r\nbattles, but my request was not granted on the plea that he was \"a\r\nyoungster.\" Verily youth was a great defect. In the spring of 1916\r\nthe Division was feverishly preparing for the break-through at Lutsk.\r\nMarkov made no secret of his innermost wish: \"It is to be either one\r\nor the other--a wooden cross or the Cross of St. George of the Third\r\nDegree.\" But the Stavka, after several refusals, compelled him to\r\naccept \"promotion\"--once again the office of Divisional Chief-of-Staff.\r\n(This measure was due to a great dearth of officers of the General\r\nStaff, because the normal activities of the Academy had come to an\r\nend. Colonels and Generals were made to hold for a second time and on\r\nspecial conditions the office of Chief of Divisional Staff before they\r\nwere appointed to Divisional Commands.) After several months on the\r\nCaucasian Front, where Markov suffered from inaction, he lectured for\r\nsome time at the Academy, which had then reopened, and later returned\r\nto the Army. At the outbreak of the Revolution he was attached to the\r\nCommanding Officer of the Tenth Army as General for special missions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of March a mutiny broke out at Briansk in the big\r\ngarrison. It was attended by pogroms and by the arrest of officers.\r\nThe townfolk were terribly excited. Markov spoke several times in the\r\ncrowded Council of Military Deputies. After tempestuous and passionate\r\ndebates, he succeeded in obtaining a resolution for restoring\r\ndiscipline and for freeing twenty of those arrested. Nevertheless,\r\nafter midnight several companies in arms moved to the railway station\r\nin order to do away with Markov and with the arrested officers. The mob\r\nwas infuriated and Markov seemed to be doomed, but his resourcefulness\r\nsaved the situation. Trying to make his voice heard above the tumult,\r\nhe addressed an impassioned appeal to the mob. The following sentence\r\noccurred in his speech: \"Had any of my 'Iron' Riflemen been here, he\r\nwould have told you who General Markov is.\" \"I served in the 13th\r\nRegiment,\" came a voice from the crowd.\r\n\r\nMarkov pushed aside several men who were surrounding him, advanced\r\nrapidly towards the soldier, and seized him by the scruff of the neck.\r\n\r\n\"You? You? Then why don't you thrust the bayonet into me? The\r\nenemy's bullet has spared me, so let me perish by the hand of my own\r\nrifleman....\"\r\n\r\nThe mob was still more intoxicated, but with admiration. Accompanied by\r\ntempestuous cheering, Markov and the arrested officers left for Minsk.\r\n\r\nMarkov was lifted by the wave of events, and gave himself entirely to\r\nthe struggle, without a thought for himself or for his family. Faith\r\nand despair succeeded each other in his mind; he loved his country and\r\nfelt sorry for the Army, which never ceased to occupy a prominent place\r\nin his heart and in his mind.\r\n\r\nReference will be made more than once in the course of this narrative\r\nto the personality of Markov, but I could not refrain from satisfying\r\nmy heart's desire in adding a few laurels to his wreath--the wreath\r\nthat was placed upon his tomb by two faithful friends, with the\r\ninscription:--\r\n\r\n    \"He lived and died for the good of his country.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n    THE POWER--THE DUMA--THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT--THE HIGH\r\n    COMMAND--THE SOVIET OF WORKMEN'S AND SOLDIERS' DELEGATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nRussia's exceptional position, confronted on the one hand with a world\r\nwar and on the other with a revolution, made the establishment of a\r\nstrong power an imperative necessity.\r\n\r\nThe DUMA, which, as I have already said, unquestionably enjoyed\r\nthe confidence of the country, refused, after lengthy and heated\r\ndiscussions, to head the Revolutionary power. Temporarily dissolved\r\nby the Imperial ukaze of February 27th, it remained loyal, and \"did\r\nnot attempt to hold an official sitting,\" as it \"considered itself a\r\nlegislative institution of the old régime, co-ordinated by fundamental\r\nlaw with the obviously doomed remnants of autocracy.\" (Miliukov,\r\n_History of the Second Russian Revolution_.) The subsequent decrees\r\nemanated from the \"private conference of the members of the Duma.\" This\r\nbody elected the \"temporary Committee of the Duma,\" which exercised\r\nsupreme power in the first days of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nWhen power was transferred to the PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT, the Duma\r\nand the Committee retired to the background, but did not cease to\r\nexist, and endeavoured to give moral support and a _raison d'être_\r\nto the first three Cabinets of the Government. On May 2nd, during\r\nthe first Government crisis, the Committee still struggled for the\r\nright to _appoint_ members of the Government; subsequently it reduced\r\nits demands to that of the right to _participate_ in the formation\r\nof the Government. Thus, on July 7th, the Committee of the Duma\r\nprotested against its exclusion from the formation of a new Provisional\r\nGovernment by Kerensky, as it considered such a course as \"legally\r\ninadmissible and politically disastrous.\" The Duma, of course, was\r\nfully entitled to participate in the direction of the life of the\r\ncountry, as, even in the camp of its enemies, the signal service\r\nwas recognised which the Duma had rendered to the Revolution \"In\r\nconverting to it the entire front and all the officers\" (Stankevitch:\r\n_Reminiscences_). There can be no doubt that, had the Soviet taken the\r\nlead in the Revolution, there would have been a fierce struggle against\r\nit, and the Revolution would have been squashed. It might, perhaps,\r\nhave then given the victory to the Liberal Democracy, and would have\r\nled the country to a normal evolutionary development. Who knows?\r\n\r\nThe members of the Duma themselves felt the strain of inactivity\r\nwhich was at first voluntary and later compulsory. There were many\r\nabsentees, and the President of the Duma had to combat this attitude.\r\nNevertheless, the Duma and the Committee were quite alive to the\r\nimportance of the trend events were taking. They issued resolutions\r\ncondemning, warning, and appealing to the common sense, the heart,\r\nand the patriotism of the people, of the Army, and of the Government.\r\nThe Duma, however, had already been swept aside by the Revolutionary\r\nelements. Its statesmanlike appeals, full of the clear consciousness of\r\nimpending perils, had ceased to impress the country, and were ignored\r\nby the Government. Even a Duma so peaceable that it did not even fight\r\nfor power aroused the apprehensions of the Revolutionary Democracy, and\r\nthe Soviets led a violent campaign for the abolition of the Council\r\nof the State and of the Duma. In August the Duma relaxed its efforts\r\nin issuing proclamations, and when Kerensky dissolved the Duma at the\r\nbidding of the Soviets, nineteen days before the expiration of its five\r\nyears' term, on October 6th, this news did not produce any appreciable\r\neffect in the country. Rodzianko kept alive for a long time the idea\r\nof the Fourth Duma or of the Assembly of all Dumas as the foundation\r\nof the power of the State. He stuck to this idea throughout the Kuban\r\ncampaigns and the Ekaterinodar Volunteer period of the anti-Bolshevik\r\nstruggle. But the Duma was dead....\r\n\r\nNone can tell whether the Duma's abdication of power was inevitable\r\nin the days of March, and whether it was rendered imperative by the\r\nrelative strength of the forces that struggled for power, whether\r\nthe \"class\" Duma could have retained the Socialist elements in its\r\nmidst and have continued to wield a certain influence in the country,\r\nacquired as a result of its fight against autocracy. It is at least\r\ncertain that, in the years of trouble in Russia, when no normal,\r\npopular representation was possible, all Governments invariably felt\r\nthe necessity for some substitute for this popular representation,\r\nwere it only as a kind of tribune from which expression could be given\r\nto different currents of thought, a rock upon which to stand and to\r\ndivine moral responsibilities. Such was the \"Temporary Council of\r\nthe Russian Republic\" at Petrograd in October, 1917, which, however,\r\nhad been started by the Revolutionary Democracy, as a counter-blast\r\nto the contemplated Bolshevik Second Congress of Soviets. Such was\r\nthe partial constituent Assembly of 1917, which was held on the Volga\r\nin the summer of 1918, and such the proposed convocation of the High\r\nCouncil and Assembly (_Sobor_) of the Zemstvos in the South of Russia\r\nand in Siberia in 1919. Even the highest manifestation of collective\r\ndictatorship--\"the Soviet of People's Commissars\"--which reached a\r\nlevel of despotism and had suppressed social life and all the live\r\nforces of the country to an extent unknown in history, and reduced\r\nthe country to a graveyard, still considered it necessary to create a\r\nkind of theatrical travesty of such a representative institution by\r\nperiodically convoking the \"All-Russian Congress of Soviets.\"\r\n\r\nThe authority of the Provisional Government contained the seed of its\r\nown impotence. As Miliukov has said, that power was devoid of the\r\n\"symbol\" to which the masses were accustomed. The Government yielded\r\nto the pressure of the Soviet, which was systematically distorting all\r\nState functions and making them subservient to the interests of class\r\nand party.\r\n\r\nKerensky, the \"hostage of Democracy,\" was in the Government. In a\r\nspeech delivered in the Soviet he thus defined his rôle: \"I am the\r\nrepresentative of Democracy, and the Provisional Government should look\r\nupon me as expressing the demands of Democracy, and should particularly\r\nheed the opinions which I may utter.\" Last, but not least, there were\r\nin the Government representatives of the Russian Liberal Intelligencia,\r\nwith all its good and bad qualities, and with the lack of will-power\r\ncharacteristic of that class, the will-power which, by its boundless\r\ndaring, its cruelty in removing obstacles, and its tenacity in seizing\r\npower, gives victory in the struggle for self-preservation to class,\r\ncaste and nationality. During the four years of the Russian turmoil the\r\nRussian Intelligencia and Bourgeoisie lived in a state of impotence\r\nand of non-resistance, and surrendered every stronghold; they even\r\nsubmitted to physical extermination and extinction. Strong will-power\r\nappeared to exist only on the two extreme flanks of the social front.\r\nUnfortunately it was a will to destroy and not to create. One flank has\r\nalready produced Lenin, Bronstein, Apfelbaum, Uritzki, Dzerjinski, and\r\nPeters.... The other flank, defeated in March, 1917, may not yet have\r\nsaid its last word. The Russian Revolution was undoubtedly national in\r\nits origin, being a mode of expressing the universal protest against\r\nthe old régime. But, when the time came for reconstruction, two forces\r\ncame into conflict which embodied and led two different currents of\r\npolitical thought, two different outlooks. According to the accepted\r\nphrase, it was a struggle between the Bourgeoisie and the Democracy.\r\nBut it would be more correct to describe it as a struggle between the\r\nBourgeois and the Socialist Democracies. Both sides derived their\r\nleading spirits from the same source--the Russian Intelligencia--by no\r\nmeans numerous and heterogeneous, not so much in respect of class and\r\nwealth as of political ideas and methods of political contest. Both\r\nsides inadequately reflected the thoughts of the popular masses in\r\nwhose name they spoke. At first these masses were merely an audience\r\napplauding the actors who most appealed to its impassioned, but not\r\naltogether idealistic, instincts. It was only after this psychological\r\ntraining that the inert masses, and in particular the Army, became, in\r\nthe words of Kerensky, \"an elemental mass melted in the fire of the\r\nRevolution and ... exercising tremendous pressure which was felt by\r\nthe entire organism of the State.\" To deny this would be tantamount to\r\nthe denial, in accordance with Tolstoi's doctrine, of the influence of\r\nleaders upon the life of the people. This theory has been completely\r\nshattered by Bolshevism, which has conquered for a long time the masses\r\nof the people with whom it has nothing in common and who are inimical\r\nto the Communist creed.\r\n\r\nIn the first weeks of the new Government the phenomenon became\r\napparent, which was described in the middle of July by the Committee of\r\nthe Duma in its appeal to the Government in the following words: \"The\r\nseizure of the power of the State by irresponsible organisations, the\r\ncreation by these organisations of a dual power in the centre, and of\r\nthe absence of power in the country.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe power of the Soviet was also conditional in spite of a series of\r\nGovernment crises and of opportunities thereby provided for seizing\r\nthat power and wielding it without opposition and unreservedly (the\r\nProvisional Government offered no resistance). The Revolutionary\r\nDemocracy, as represented by the Soviet, categorically declined to\r\nassume that rôle because it realised quite clearly that it lacked\r\nthe strength, the knowledge, and the skill to govern the country in\r\nwhich it had as yet no real support. Tzeretelli, one of the leaders\r\nof Revolutionary Democracy, said: \"The time is not yet ripe for\r\nthe fulfilment of the ultimate aims of the proletariat and for\r\nthe solution of class questions.... We understand that a Bourgeois\r\nRevolution is in progress ... as we are unable fully to attain to our\r\nbright ideal ... and we _do not wish to assume that responsibility\r\nfor the collapse of the movement_, which we could not avoid if we\r\nmade the desperate attempt to impose our will upon events at the\r\npresent moment.\" Another representative, Nahamkes, said that they\r\npreferred \"to compel the Government to comply with their demands by\r\nmeans of perpetual organised pressure.\" A member of the Executive\r\nCommittee of the Soviet, Stankevitch, thus describes the Soviet in his\r\n_Reminiscences_, which reflect the incorrigible idealism of a Socialist\r\nwho is off the rails and who has now reached the stage of excusing\r\nBolshevism, but who nevertheless impresses one as being sincere: \"The\r\nSoviet, a gathering of illiterate soldiers, took the lead because\r\nit asked nothing and because it was only a screen covering what was\r\nactually complete anarchy.\" Two thousand soldiers from the rear and\r\neight hundred workmen from Petrograd formed an institution which\r\npretended to guide the political, military, economic and social life\r\nof an enormous country. The records of the meetings of the Soviet,\r\nas reported in the Press, testify to the extraordinary ignorance and\r\nconfusion which reigned at these meetings. One could not help being\r\npainfully impressed by such a \"representation\" of Russia. An impotent\r\nand subdued anger against the Soviet was growing in the circles of the\r\nIntelligencia, the Democratic Bourgeoisie and the Officers. All their\r\nhatred was concentrated upon the Soviet, which they abused in terms\r\nof excessive bitterness. That hatred, often openly expressed, was\r\nwrongly interpreted by the Revolutionary Democracy as abhorrence of\r\nthe very _idea of Democratic Representation_. In time the supremacy of\r\nthe Petrograd Soviet, which ascribed to itself the exceptional merit\r\nof having destroyed the old régime, began to wane. A vast network\r\nof Committees and Soviets, which had flooded the country and the\r\nArmy, claimed the right to participate in the work of the State. In\r\nApril, therefore, a Congress was held of the delegates of Workmen and\r\nSoldiers' Soviets. The Petrograd Soviet was reorganised on the basis\r\nof a more regular representation, and in June the All-Russian Congress\r\nof Representatives of the Soviets was opened. The composition of this\r\nfuller representation of Democracy is interesting:--\r\n\r\n Revolutionary Socialists                   285\r\n Social Democrats (Mensheviks)              248\r\n Social Democrats (Bolsheviks)              105\r\n Internationalists                           32\r\n Other Socialists                            73\r\n United Social Democrats                     10\r\n Members of the \"Bund\"                       10\r\n Members of the \"Edimstvo\" (Unity) group      3\r\n Popular Socialists                           3\r\n Trudovik (Labour)                            5\r\n Communist Anarchists                         1\r\n\r\nThus, the overwhelming masses of Non-Socialist Russia were not\r\nrepresented at all; even the elements that were either non-political\r\nor belonged to the groups of the right and were elected by the Soviets\r\nand Army Committees as non-party members, hastened for motives\r\naltogether in the interests of the State to profess the Socialistic\r\ncreed. In these circumstances the Revolutionary Democracy could hardly\r\nbe expected to exercise self-restraint, and there could be no hope\r\nof keeping the popular movement within the limits of the Bourgeois\r\nRevolution. In reality the ramshackle helm was seized by a block of\r\nSocial Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, in which first the former and\r\nthen the latter predominated. It is that narrow partisan block which\r\nheld in bondage the will of the Government and is primarily responsible\r\nfor the subsequent course of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the Soviet was heterogeneous: intellectuals,\r\nbourgeoisie, workmen, soldiers and many deserters. The Soviet and the\r\nCongresses, and especially the former, were a somewhat inert mass,\r\nutterly devoid of political education. Action, power and influence\r\nafterwards passed therefore into the hands of Executive Committees\r\nin which the Socialist intellectual elements were almost exclusively\r\nrepresented. The most devastating criticism of the Executive Committee\r\nof the Soviet came from that very institution, and was made by one\r\nof its members, Stankevitch: the meetings were chaotic, political\r\ndisorganisation, indecision, haste, and fitfulness showed themselves\r\nin its decisions, and there was a complete absence of administrative\r\nexperience and true democracy. One of the members advocated anarchy in\r\nthe \"Izvestia,\" another sent written permits for the expropriation of\r\nthe landlords, a third explained to a military delegation which had\r\ncomplained of the Commanding Officers that these officers should be\r\ndismissed and arrested, etc.\r\n\r\n\"The most striking feature of the Committee is the preponderance of the\r\nalien element,\" wrote Stankevitch. \"Jews, Georgians, Letts, Poles, and\r\nLithuanians were represented out of all proportion to their numbers\r\nin Petrograd and in the country.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRussia during the turmoil.\r\n\r\n         +----------+----------+-----------+-------+-----------+\r\n         |          |          |           |       |           |\r\n Anarcho-Communists |      Non-Party       |   Non-Party  Conservatives\r\n      ########      |      ----####        |   --------     --------\r\n                    |      (Peasants)      |\r\n                    |     Workmen (few)    |\r\n                    |                      |\r\n                Socialists              Liberals\r\n                    |                   --------\r\n        +-----------+-------------+        |\r\n        |           |             |        +--------------+\r\n        |       Non-Party         |        |              |\r\n        |       ----####          |  Constitutional-   Radical-\r\n        |      Mostly Workmen     |     --------       --------\r\n        |                         |     Democrats      Democrats\r\n Social-Democrats             Populists\r\n        |                         |\r\n     +--+---+----+                +---------------+-----------+\r\n     |      |    |                |               |           |\r\n Bolsheviks | Edinstvo          Social          Popular     Labour\r\n  ########  | --------      Revolutionaries    --------    --------\r\n            |                     |           Socialists  \"Trudovik\"\r\n        Mensheviks                |\r\n            |                     +------+-------+\r\n        +---+-----------+         |      |       |\r\n        |               |        Left  Centre  Right\r\n Internationalists  Defencists   ####  ---###  ----\r\n     ########        --------\r\n\r\n -------- Defencists\r\n\r\n ----#### Partly Defencist\r\n          Partly Defeatist\r\n\r\n ######## Defeatists\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of the first Presidium of the All-Russian\r\nCentral Committee of the Soviets:--\r\n\r\n    1 Georgian\r\n    5 Jews\r\n    1 Armenian\r\n    1 Pole\r\n    1 Russian (if his name was not an assumed one).\r\n\r\nThis exceptional preponderance of the alien element, foreign to the\r\nRussian national idea, could not fail to tinge the entire activities of\r\nthe Soviet with a spirit harmful to the interests of the Russian State.\r\nThe Provisional Government was the captive of the Soviet from the very\r\nfirst day, as it had under-estimated the importance and the power\r\nof that institution, and was unable to display either determination\r\nor strength in resisting the Soviet. The Government did not even\r\nhope for victory in that struggle, as, in its endeavour to save the\r\ncountry, it could not very well proclaim watchwords which would have\r\nsuited the licentious mob and which emanated from the Soviet. The\r\nGovernment talked about duty, the Soviet about rights. The former\r\n\"prohibited,\" the latter \"permitted.\" The Government was linked with\r\nthe old power by the inheritance of statesmanship and organisation, as\r\nwell as the external methods of administration; whereas the Soviet,\r\nspringing from mutiny and from the slums, was the direct negation of\r\nthe entire old régime. It is a delusion to think, as a small portion\r\nof the moderate democracy still appear to do, that the Soviet played\r\nthe part of \"restraining the tidal wave of the people.\" _The Soviet\r\ndid not actually destroy the Russian State, but was shattering it,\r\nand did so to the extent of smashing the Army and imposing Bolshevism\r\non it._ Hence the duplicity and insincerity of its activities. Apart\r\nfrom its declarations, all the speeches, conversations, comments,\r\nand articles of the Soviet and of the Executive Committee, of its\r\ngroups and individuals, came to the knowledge of the country and of\r\nthe Front, and tended towards the destruction of the authority of the\r\nGovernment. Stankevitch wrote that not deliberately, but persistently,\r\nthe Committee was dealing death-blows to the Government.\r\n\r\nWho, then, were the men who were trying to democratise the Army\r\nRegulations, smashing all the foundations of the Army, inspiring the\r\nPolivanov Commission, and tying the hands of two War Ministers? The\r\nfollowing is the personnel elected in the beginning of April from the\r\nSoldiers' Section of the Soviet to the Executive Committee:--\r\n\r\n War-time Officers                    1\r\n Clerks                               2\r\n Cadets                               2\r\n Soldiers from the rear               9\r\n Scribes and men on special duty      5\r\n\r\nI will leave their description to Stankevitch, who said: \"At first\r\nhysterical, noisy, and unbalanced men were elected, who were utterly\r\nuseless to the Committee....\" New elements were subsequently added.\r\n\"The latter tried consciously, and in the measure of their ability, to\r\ncope with the ocean of military matters. Two of them, however, seemed\r\nto have been inoffensive scribes in Reserve Battalions, who had never\r\ntaken the slightest interest in the War, the Army, or the political\r\nRevolution.\" The duplicity and the insincerity of the Soviet were\r\nclearly manifested in regard to the War. The intellectual circles of\r\nthe Left and of the Revolutionary Democracy mostly espoused the idea\r\nof Zimmerwald and of Internationalism. It was natural, therefore, that\r\nthe first word which the Soviet addressed on March 14, 1917, \"To the\r\nPeoples of the Whole World,\" was:\r\n\r\n                                \"PEACE.\"\r\n\r\nThe world problems, infinitely complex, owing to the national,\r\npolitical, and economic interests of the peoples who differed in their\r\nunderstanding of the Eternal Truth, could not be solved in such an\r\nelementary fashion. Bethmann-Holweg was contemptuously silent. On\r\nMarch 17th, 1917, the Reichstag, by a majority against the votes of\r\nboth Social Democratic parties, declined the offer of peace without\r\nannexations. Noske voiced the views of the German Democracy in saying:\r\n\"We are offered from abroad to organise a Revolution. If we follow\r\nthat advice the working classes will come to grief.\" Among the Allies\r\nand the Allied Democracies the Soviet manifesto provoked anxiety,\r\nbewilderment, and discontent, which were vividly expressed in the\r\nspeeches made by Albert Thomas, Henderson, Vandervelde, and even the\r\npresent-day French Bolshevik, Cachin, upon their visits to Russia. The\r\nSoviet subsequently added to the word \"Peace\" the definition, \"Without\r\nannexations and indemnities on the basis of the self-determination of\r\npeoples.\" The theory of this formula promptly clashed with the actual\r\nquestion of Western and Southern Russia occupied by the Germans;\r\nof Poland, of Roumania, Belgium, and Serbia, devastated by the\r\nGermans; of Alsace-Lorraine and Posen, as well as of the servitude,\r\nexpropriations, and compulsory labour which had been imposed upon all\r\nthe countries invaded by the Germans. According to the programme of the\r\nGerman Social Democrats, which was at length published in Stockholm,\r\nthe French in Alsace-Lorraine, the Poles in Posen, and the Danes in\r\nSchleswig were only to be granted national autonomy under the sceptre\r\nof the German Emperor. At the same time, the idea of the independence\r\nof Finland, Russian Poland, and Ireland was strongly advocated. The\r\ndemand for the restoration of the German colonies was curiously blended\r\nwith the promises of independence for India, Siam, Korea.\r\n\r\nThe sun did not rise at the bidding of Chanticleer. The _ballon\r\nd'essai_ failed. The Soviet was forced to admit that \"time is necessary\r\nin order that the peoples of all countries should rise, and with\r\nan iron hand compel their rulers and capitalists to make peace....\r\nMeanwhile, the comrade-soldiers who have sworn to defend Russian\r\nliberties should not refuse to advance, as this may become a military\r\nnecessity....\" The Revolutionary Democracy was perplexed, and their\r\nattitude was clearly expressed in the words of Tchkeidze: \"We have\r\nbeen preaching against the War all the time. How can I appeal to the\r\nsoldiers to continue the War and to stay at the Front?\"\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, the words \"War\" and \"Advance\" had been uttered.\r\nThey divided the Soviet Socialists into two camps, the \"Defeatists\"\r\nand \"Defensists.\"[17] Theoretically, only the right groups of the\r\nSocial Revolutionaries, the popular Socialists, the \"Unity\" (\"Edistvo\")\r\ngroup, and the Labour party (\"Trudoviki\") belonged to the latter.\r\nAll other Socialists advocated the immediate cessation of the war and\r\nthe \"deepening\" of the Revolution by means of internal Class War. In\r\npractice, when the question of the continuation of the war was put to\r\nthe vote, the Defensists were joined by the majority of the Social\r\nRevolutionaries and of the Social Democrat Mensheviks. The resolutions,\r\nhowever, bore the stamp of ambiguity--neither war nor peace. Tzeretelli\r\nwas advocating \"a movement against the war in all countries, Allied and\r\nenemy.\" The Congress of the Soviets at the end of May passed an equally\r\nambiguous resolution, which, after demanding that annexations and\r\nindemnities should be renounced by all belligerents, pointed out that,\r\n\"so long as the war lasts, the collapse of the Army, the weakening\r\nof its spirit, strength and capacity for _active_ operations would\r\nconstitute a strong menace to the cause of Freedom and to the vital\r\ninterests of the country.\" In the beginning of June the Second Congress\r\npassed a new resolution. On the one hand, it emphatically declared that\r\n\"the question of the advance should be decided solely from the point of\r\nview of purely military and strategical considerations\"; on the other\r\nhand, it expressed an obviously Defeatist idea: \"Should the war end by\r\nthe complete defeat of one of the belligerent groups, this would be\r\na source of new wars, would increase the enmity between peoples, and\r\nwould result in their complete exhaustion, in starvation and doom.\"\r\nThe Revolutionary Democracy had obviously confused two ideas: the\r\n_strategic victory_ signifying the end of the war and _the terms of the\r\nPeace Treaty_, which might be humane or inhuman, righteous or unjust,\r\nfar-seeing or short-sighted. In fact, what they wanted was war and\r\nan advance, but _without a victory_. Curiously enough, the Prussian\r\nDeputy, Strebel, the editor of _Vorwaerts_, invented the same formula\r\nas early as in 1915. He wrote: \"I openly profess that a complete\r\nvictory of the Empire would not benefit the Social Democracy.\"\r\n\r\nThere was not a single branch of administration with which the Soviet\r\nand the Executive Committee did not interfere with the same ambiguity\r\nand insincerity, due on the one hand to the fear of any action contrary\r\nto the fundamentals of their doctrine, and on the other to the obvious\r\nimpossibility of putting these doctrines into practice. The Soviet\r\ndid not, and could not, partake in the creative work of rebuilding\r\nthe State. With regard to Economics, Agriculture, and Labour, the\r\nactivities of the Soviet were reduced to the publication of pompous\r\nSocialist Party programmes, which the Socialist Ministers themselves\r\nclearly understood to be impracticable in the atmosphere of War,\r\nAnarchy, and Economic crisis prevailing in Russia. Nevertheless, these\r\nResolutions and Proclamations were interpreted in the factories and\r\nin the villages as a kind of \"Absolution.\" They roused the passions\r\nand provoked the desire, immediately and arbitrarily, to put them\r\ninto practice. This provocation was followed by restraining appeals.\r\nIn an appeal addressed to the sailors of Kronstadt on May 26th, 1917,\r\nthe Soviet suggested \"that they should demand immediate and implicit\r\ncompliance with all the orders of the Provisional Government given in\r\nthe interests of the Revolution and of the security of the country....\"\r\n\r\nAll these literary achievements are not, however, the only form of\r\nactivity in which the Soviet indulged. The characteristic feature of\r\nthe Soviet and of the Executive Committee was the complete absence of\r\ndiscipline in their midst. With reference to the special Delegation\r\nof the Committee, whose object it was to be in contact with the\r\nProvisional Government, Stankevitch says: \"What could that Delegation\r\ndo? While it was arguing and reaching a complete agreement with the\r\nMinisters, dozens of members of the Committee were sending letters\r\nand publishing articles; travelling in the provinces, and at the\r\nFront in the name of the Committee; receiving callers at the Taurida\r\nPalace, everyone of them acting independently and taking no heed of\r\ninstructions, Resolutions, or decisions of the Committee.\"\r\n\r\nWas the Central Committee of the Soviet invested with actual power? A\r\nreply to this question can be found in the appeal of the Organising\r\nCommittee of the Labour Socialist Democratic Party of July 17th. \"The\r\nwatchword 'All-Power to the Soviets,' to which many workmen adhere, is\r\na dangerous one. _The following of the Soviets represents a minority\r\nin the population_, and we must make every effort in order that the\r\nBourgeois elements, who are still willing and capable of joining us\r\nin preserving the conquests of the Revolution, shall share with us\r\nthe burdens of the inheritance left by the old régime, which we have\r\nshouldered, and the enormous responsibility for the outcome of the\r\nRevolution which we bear in the eyes of the people.\" The Soviet, and\r\nlater the All-Russian Central Committee, could not, and would not,\r\nby reason of its composition and their political ideas, exercise a\r\npowerful restraining influence upon the masses of the people, who had\r\nthrown off the shackles and were perturbed and mutinous. The movement\r\nhad been inspired by the members of the Soviet, and the influence and\r\nauthority of the Soviet were, therefore, entirely dependent on the\r\nextent to which they were able to flatter the instincts of the masses.\r\nThese masses, as Karl Kautsky, an observer from the Marxist Camp, has\r\nsaid, \"were concerned merely with their requirements and their desires\r\nas soon as they were drawn into the Revolution, and they did not care a\r\nstraw whether their demands were practicable or beneficial to society.\"\r\nHad the Soviet endeavoured to resist with any firmness or determination\r\nwhatsoever the pressure of the masses, it would have run the risk of\r\nbeing swept away. Also, day after day and step by step, the Soviet was\r\ncoming under the influence of Anarchist and Bolshevik ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n    THE BOLSHEVIK STRUGGLE FOR POWER--THE POWER OF THE ARMY AND THE\r\n    IDEA OF A DICTATORSHIP.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the first period--from the beginning of the Revolution until the\r\n_coup d'état_ of November--the Bolsheviks were engaged in struggling\r\nto seize power by destroying the Bourgeois régime and disorganising\r\nthe Army, thus paving the way for the _avénement_ of Bolshevism, as\r\nTrotsky solemnly expressed it. On the day after his arrival in Russia\r\nLenin published his programme, of which I will here mention the salient\r\npoints:\r\n\r\n    (1) The War waged by the \"Capitalist Government\" is an\r\n    Imperialistic, plundering War. No concessions, therefore, should\r\n    be made to Revolutionary \"Defensism.\" The representatives of that\r\n    doctrine and the Army in the field should be made clearly to\r\n    understand that the War cannot end in a truly Democratic peace,\r\n    without coercion, _unless_ Capitalism is destroyed.\r\n\r\n    The troops must fraternize with the enemy.\r\n\r\n    (2) The first stage of the Revolution by which the Bourgeoisie came\r\n    into power must be followed by the second stage in which power must\r\n    pass into the hands of the Proletariat and of the poorest peasants.\r\n\r\n    (3) No support should be given to the Provisional Government, and\r\n    the fallacy of its promises should be exposed.\r\n\r\n    (4) The fact must be acknowledged that, in the majority of the\r\n    Soviets, the Bolshevik party is in a minority. The policy must\r\n    therefore be continued of criticising and exposing mistakes, while\r\n    at the same time advocating the necessity for the transfer of\r\n    Supreme Power to the Soviet.\r\n\r\n    (5) Russia is not a Parliamentary Republic--that would have been\r\n    a step backwards--but a Republic of the Soviets of Workmen's and\r\n    Peasants' Deputies.\r\n\r\n    The police (Militia?), the Army, and the Civil Service must be\r\n    abolished.\r\n\r\n    (6) With regard to the agrarian question, the Soviets of\r\n    farm-labourers' deputies must come to the fore. All landowners'\r\n    estates must be confiscated, and all land in Russia nationalised\r\n    and placed at the disposal of Local Soviets of Peasants' Deputies.\r\n    The latter to be elected among the poorest peasants.\r\n\r\n    (7) All the banks in the country must be united in one National\r\n    Bank, controlled by the Soviet.\r\n\r\n    (8) Socialism must not be introduced now, but a step must be taken\r\n    towards the ultimate control by the Soviet of all industries and of\r\n    the distribution of materials.\r\n\r\n    (9) The State shall become a Commune, and the Socialist Democratic\r\n    Bolshevik Party shall henceforward be called \"The Communist Party.\"\r\n\r\nI shall not dwell upon this programme, which was put into practice,\r\nwith certain reservations, in November, 1917. During the first period\r\nthe activities of the Bolsheviks, which are of great importance, were\r\nbased upon the following three principles:\r\n\r\n    (1) The overthrow of the Government and the demoralisation of the\r\n    Army.\r\n\r\n    (2) The promotion of class war in the country and discontent in the\r\n    villages.\r\n\r\n    (3) The seizure of power by the minority, which, according to\r\n    Lenin, was to be \"well-organised, armed and centralised,\" _i.e._,\r\n    the Bolshevik party. (This was, of course, a negation of Democratic\r\n    forms of Government.)\r\n\r\nThe ideas and aims of the party were, of course, beyond the\r\nunderstanding not only of the ignorant Russian peasantry, but even of\r\nthe Bolshevik underlings scattered throughout the land. The masses\r\nwanted simple and clear watchwords to be immediately put into practice,\r\nwhich would satisfy their wishes and demands arising from the turmoil\r\nof the Revolution. That \"simplified\" Bolshevism inherent in all\r\npopular movements against the established power in Russia was all the\r\neasier to institute in that it had freed itself from all restraining\r\nmoral influences and was aiming primarily at destruction pure and\r\nsimple, ignoring the consequences of military defeat and of the ruin\r\nof the country. The Provisional Government was the first target. In\r\nthe Bolshevik Press, at public meetings, in all the activities of\r\nthe Soviets and Congresses, and even in their conversations with\r\nthe members of the Provisional Government, the Bolshevik leaders\r\nstubbornly and arrogantly advocated its removal, describing it as\r\nan instrument of counter-Revolution and of International reaction.\r\nThe Bolsheviks, however, refrained from decisive action, as they\r\nfeared the political backwardness of the country as a whole. They\r\nbegan what soldiers call \"a reconnaissance,\" and carried it out with\r\ngreat intensity. They seized several private houses in Petrograd, and\r\norganised a demonstration on the 20th and 21st of April. That was the\r\nfirst \"review\" of the proletariat, at which an estimate was made of\r\nthe Bolshevik forces. The excuse for this demonstration, in which the\r\nworkmen and the troops participated, was given by Miliukov's Note on\r\nInternational Policy. I say _excuse_ because the real reason lay in\r\nthe fundamental divergence of opinion mentioned above. Everything else\r\nwas only a pretext. As a result of the demonstration there were great\r\ndisturbances and armed conflicts in the capital, and many casualties.\r\nThe crowds carried placards bearing the inscriptions: \"Down with\r\nthe Miliukov Policy of Conquests,\" and \"Down with the Provisional\r\nGovernment.\"\r\n\r\nThe review was a failure. In the course of the debate in the Soviet on\r\nthis occasion, the Bolsheviks demanded that the Government be deposed,\r\nbut there was a note of hesitation in their speeches: \"The proletariat\r\nshould first discuss the existing conditions and form an estimate of\r\nits strength.\" The Soviet passed a resolution condemning both the\r\nGovernment's policy of conquest and the Bolshevik demonstration,\r\nwhile at the same time \"congratulating the Revolutionary Democracy\r\nof Petrograd, which had proved its intense interest in international\r\npolitics by meetings, resolutions and demonstrations.\"\r\n\r\nLenin was planning another armed demonstration on a large scale on June\r\n10th during the Congress of the Soviets; but it was countermanded, as\r\nthe great majority of the Congress was opposed to it. The demonstration\r\nwas likewise intended as a means of seizing power. This internal\r\nstruggle between the two wings of the Revolutionary Democracy, which\r\nwere bitterly antagonistic to one another, is extremely interesting.\r\nThe Left wing made every endeavour to induce the \"Defensist\" block,\r\nwhich was preponderant, to break with the Bourgeoisie and to assume\r\npower. The block was also resolutely opposed to such a course.\r\n\r\nWithin the Soviets new combinations were coming into being. On certain\r\nquestions the Social Revolutionaries of the Left and the Social\r\nDemocrats--Internationalists--were leaning towards the Bolsheviks.\r\nNevertheless, until September the Bolsheviks were not in a majority\r\nin the Petrograd Soviet or in many provincial Soviets. It was only on\r\nSeptember 25th that Bronstein Trotsky succeeded Tchkeidze as Chairman\r\nof the Petrograd Soviet. The motto, \"All Power to the Soviets,\"\r\nsounded from their lips like self-sacrifice or provocation. Trotsky\r\nexplained this contradiction by saying that, owing to constant\r\nre-elections, the Soviets reflected the true (?) spirit of the masses\r\nof workmen and soldiers, who were leaning to the Left, whereas, after\r\nthe break with the Bourgeoisie, extremist tendencies were bound to\r\nprevail in the Soviets. As the true aspect of Bolshevism gradually\r\nrevealed itself these dissensions deepened, and were not limited to\r\nthe Social Democratic programme or to party tactics. It was a struggle\r\nbetween Democracy and the Proletariat, between the majority and a\r\nminority, which was intellectually backward, but strong in its mutinous\r\ndaring and headed by strong and unprincipled men. It was a struggle\r\nbetween the democratic principles of Universal Suffrage, political\r\nliberties, equality, etc., and the dictatorship of a privileged class,\r\nmadness, and imminent slavery. On the 2nd July there was a second\r\nMinisterial crisis, for which the outward cause was the disapproval\r\nof the Liberal Ministers of the Act of Ukrainian Autonomy. On July\r\n3rd-5th the Bolsheviks made another riot in the Capital, in which\r\nworkmen, soldiers and sailors participated. It was done this time on\r\na large scale, and was accompanied by plunder and murder. There were\r\nmany victims, and the Government was in great difficulty. Kerensky\r\nwas at that time visiting us on the Western Front. His conversations\r\nwith Petrograd over the direct wire indicated that Prince Lvov and\r\nthe Government were deeply depressed. Prince Lvov summoned Kerensky\r\nto return to Petrograd at once, but warned him that he could not\r\nbe responsible for his safety. The rebels demanded that the Soviet\r\nand the Central Executive Committee of the Congress should assume\r\npower. These wings of the Revolutionary Democracy returned another\r\ncategorical refusal. The movement found no support in the provinces,\r\nand the mutiny was quelled chiefly by the Vladimir military school and\r\nthe Cossack regiments. Several companies of the Petrograd garrison\r\nlikewise remained loyal. Bronstein Trotsky wrote that the movement was\r\npremature because there were too many passive and irresolute elements\r\nin the garrison; but that it had nevertheless been proved that, \"except\r\nthe cadets, no one wanted to fight against the Bolsheviks _for the\r\nGovernment and for the leading parties in the Soviet_.\"\r\n\r\nThe tragedy of the Government headed by Kerensky, and of the Soviet,\r\nlay in the fact that the masses would not follow abstract watchwords.\r\nThey proved equally indifferent to the country and to the Revolution,\r\nas well as to the International, and had no intention of shedding their\r\nblood and sacrificing their lives for any of these ideas. The crowd\r\nfollowed those who gave practical promises and flattered its instincts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of \"power,\" with reference to the first period of the\r\nRussian Revolution, we actually mean only its outward forms; for under\r\nthe exceptional conditions imposed by a World War on a scale unequalled\r\nin history, when 20 per cent. of the entire male population was under\r\narms, the power was really concentrated in the hands of the Army. That\r\nArmy had been led astray, had been demoralised by false doctrines, had\r\nlost all sense of duty, and all fear of authority. Last, but not least,\r\nit had no leader. The Government, Kerensky, the Commanding Corps, the\r\nSoviet, Regimental Committees--for many reasons none of these could\r\nclaim that title. The dissensions between all these contending forces\r\nwere reflected in the minds of the men, and hastened the ruin of the\r\nArmy. It is useless to make any surmises which cannot be proved by\r\nrealities, especially in the absence of historical perspective; but\r\nthere can be no doubt the question, whether or not it would have been\r\npossible to erect a dam which would have stemmed the tide and preserved\r\ndiscipline in the Army, will continue to arouse attention. Personally,\r\nI believe that it was possible. At first the Supreme Command might have\r\ndone it, as well as the Government, had it shown sufficient resolve to\r\nsquash the Soviets or sufficient strength and wisdom to draw them into\r\nthe orbit of statesmanship and of truly democratic constructive work.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that, in the beginning of the Revolution, the\r\nGovernment was recognised by all the sane elements of the population.\r\nThe High Command, the officers, many regiments, the Bourgeoisie, and\r\nthose Democratic elements which had not been led astray by militant\r\nSocialism adhered to the Government. The Press in those days was full\r\nof telegrams, addresses and appeals from all parts of Russia, from\r\nvarious Social, Military and class organisations and institutions whose\r\ndemocratic attitude was undoubted.\r\n\r\nAs the Government weakened and was driven into two successive\r\ncoalitions, that confidence correspondingly decreased and could not\r\nfind compensation in fuller recognition by the Revolutionary Democracy;\r\nbecause anarchist tendencies, repudiating all authority, were gaining\r\nground within these circles. In the beginning of May, after the armed\r\nrising in the streets of Petrograd, which took place without the\r\nknowledge of the Soviet, but with the participation of its members;\r\nafter the resignation of Miliukov and Gutchkov, the complete impotence\r\nof the Provisional Government became so clearly apparent that Prince\r\nLvov appealed to the Soviet, with the consent of the Duma Committee and\r\nof the Constitutional Democratic Party. He invited \"the active creative\r\nforces of the country to participate directly in the government which\r\nhad hitherto refrained from any such participation.\"\r\n\r\nAfter some hesitation, the Soviet deemed it necessary to accept the\r\noffer, thereby assuming direct responsibility for the fate of the\r\nrevolution. (Four members of the Soviet accepted Ministerial posts.)\r\nThe Soviet declined to assume full power \"because the transfer of\r\npower to the Soviets in that period of the revolution would have\r\nweakened it and would have prematurely estranged the elements capable\r\nof serving it, which would constitute a menace to the revolution.\" The\r\nimpression produced by such declarations upon the Bourgeoisie and upon\r\nthe \"hostages\" in the Coalition Government can be imagined. Although\r\nthe Soviet expressed full confidence in the Government and appealed\r\nto the democracy to grant it full support, which would guarantee the\r\nauthority of the Government, that Government was already irretrievably\r\ndiscredited. The Socialist circles which had sent their representatives\r\nto join it neither altered nor strengthened its intellectual level. On\r\nthe contrary, it was weakened, inasmuch as the gulf was widened which\r\nseparated the two political groups represented in the Government.\r\nWhile officially expressing confidence in the Government, the Soviet\r\ncontinued to undermine its power and became somewhat lukewarm towards\r\nthe Socialist Ministers, who had been compelled by circumstances to\r\ndeviate, to a certain extent, from the programme of the Socialist\r\nparty. The people and the Army did not pay much attention to these\r\nevents, as they were beginning to forget that there was any power at\r\nall, owing to the fact that the existence of that power had no bearing\r\nupon their everyday life.\r\n\r\nThe blood shed during the Petrograd rising organised by the\r\nanarchist-Bolshevik section of the Soviet on July 4th-5th, Prince\r\nLvov's resignation, and the formation of a new coalition in which the\r\nSocialists, nominated by the Soviet, definitely predominated were\r\nbut stepping stones towards the complete collapse of the power of\r\nthe State. As I have already said, the first Government crisis was\r\noccasioned by events which, however important politically, were only\r\n\"excuses.\" In the new Coalition the Democratic Bourgeoisie played but\r\na secondary part, and its \"temporary\" assistance was only required in\r\norder that responsibility might be shared; while everything was decided\r\nbehind the curtain, in the circles closely connected with the Soviet.\r\nSuch a coalition could have no vitality and could not reconcile even\r\nthe opportunist elements of the Bourgeoisie with the Revolutionary\r\nDemocracy. Apart from political and social considerations, the relative\r\nstrength of the forces which were brought into play was influenced\r\nby the growing discontent of the masses with the activities of the\r\nGovernment owing to the general condition of the country. The masses\r\naccepted the revolution not as an arduous, transitory period, linked\r\nup with the past and present political development of Russia and of\r\nthe world, but as an independent reality of the day, carrying in its\r\ntrail real calamities such as the War, banditism, lawlessness, stoppage\r\nof industry, cold and hunger. The masses were unable to grasp the\r\nsituation in its complex entirety and could not differentiate between\r\nelemental, inevitable phenomena inherent in all revolutions and the\r\nwill for good or evil of departments of the Government, institutions\r\nor individuals. They felt that the situation was intolerable and tried\r\nto find a remedy. As a result of the universal recognition of the\r\nimpotence of the existing power, a new idea began to occupy the minds\r\nof the people:\r\n\r\n                            A DICTATORSHIP.\r\n\r\nI emphatically declare that in the social and military circles with\r\nwhich I was in touch the tendency towards a dictatorship was prompted\r\nby a patriotic and clear consciousness of the abyss into which the\r\nRussian people was rapidly sinking. _It was not in the slightest\r\ndegree inspired by any reactionary or counter-revolutionary motives._\r\nThere can be no doubt that the movement found adherents among the\r\nreactionaries and among mere opportunists; but both these elements\r\nwere accessory and insignificant. Kerensky thus interpreted the rise\r\nof the movement which he described as \"the tide of conspiracy\": \"The\r\nTarnopol defeat created a movement in favour of conspiracies, while the\r\nBolshevik rising of July demonstrated to the uninitiated the _depth of\r\nthe disruption of Democracy, the impotence of the revolution_ against\r\nanarchy, as well as the strength of the organised minority which acted\r\nspontaneously.\" It would be difficult to find a better excuse for the\r\nmovement. In the atmosphere of popular discontent, universal disorder\r\nand approaching anarchy, endeavours at creating a dictatorship were the\r\nnatural outcome of the existing conditions. These endeavours had their\r\norigin in a search for a _strong national and democratic power, but not\r\na reactionary one_.\r\n\r\nOn the whole the Revolutionary Democracy lived in an atmosphere\r\npoisoned by the fear of a counter-revolution. All its cares, measures,\r\nresolutions and appeals, as well as the disruption of the Army and the\r\nabolition of the police in the villages, tended towards a struggle with\r\nthis imaginary foe, which was supposed to menace the conquests of the\r\nrevolution. Were the conscious leaders of the Soviet really convinced\r\nthat such a danger existed, or were they fanning this unfounded fear\r\nas a tactical move? I am inclined to accept the second solution,\r\nbecause it was quite obvious, not only to myself, but to the Soviet\r\nas well, that the activities of the Democratic Bourgeoisie meant not\r\ncounter-revolution, but merely opposition. And yet in the Russian\r\npartisan press and in wide circles outside Russia it is precisely\r\nin the former sense that the pre-November period of the Revolution\r\nwas interpreted. The Provisional Government proclaimed a broad,\r\nDemocratic programme upon its formation. In the circles of the Right\r\nthis programme was criticised and there was discontent; but no active\r\nopposition. In the first four or five months after the beginning of\r\nthe Revolution there was not a single important counter-revolutionary\r\norganisation in the country. These organisations became more or less\r\nactive and other secret circles, especially officers' circles, were\r\nformed in July in connection with the plans for a Dictatorship. There\r\ncan be no doubt that many people with pronounced tendencies towards a\r\nrestoration joined these circles. But their main object was to combat\r\nthe unofficial government, which was a class government, as well as\r\nthe personnel of the Soviet and the Executive Committee. Had these\r\ncircles not collapsed prematurely owing to their weakness, numerical\r\ninsignificance and lack of organisation, some of the members of\r\nthose institutions might very possibly have been destroyed. While\r\nconstantly resisting counter-revolution from the Right, the Soviet gave\r\nevery opportunity for the preparations for a real counter-revolution\r\nemanating from its own midst, from the Bolsheviks.\r\n\r\nI remember that different persons who came to the Stavka began to\r\ndiscuss the question of a dictatorship and to throw out feelers, as it\r\nwere, approximately in the beginning of June. All these conversations\r\nwere stereotyped to such an extent that I have no difficulty in\r\nsummarising them.\r\n\r\n\"Russia is moving towards inevitable ruin. The Government is utterly\r\npowerless. We must have a strong power. Sooner or later we shall have\r\nto come to a Dictatorship.\"\r\n\r\nNobody mentioned restoration or a change of policy in a reactionary\r\ndirection. The names were mentioned of Kornilov and Brussilov. I\r\nwarned them against hasty decisions. I must confess that we still\r\nentertained the illusory hope that the Government--by internal\r\nevolution, under the influence of a new, armed demonstration on the\r\npart of the anti-National extremist elements towards which they were so\r\nlenient--would realise the futility and hopelessness of continuing in\r\ntheir present position and would come to the idea of power vested in\r\none man, which might be achieved in a constitutional manner. The future\r\nseemed pregnant with disaster in the absence of a truly lawful power.\r\nI pointed out that there were no military leaders enjoying sufficient\r\nauthority with the demoralised soldiery, but that if a military\r\ndictatorship should become necessary for the State and practicable,\r\nKornilov was already very much respected by the officers, whereas\r\nBrussilov's reputation had been injured by his opportunism.\r\n\r\nIn his book Kerensky says that \"Cossack circles and certain politicians\"\r\nhad suggested repeatedly to him that the impotent Government should\r\nbe replaced by a personal dictatorship. It was only when society was\r\ndisappointed in him as the \"possible organiser and chief agent for\r\naltering the system of Government\" that \"a search began for another\r\nindividual.\"\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the men and social circles that appealed to\r\nKerensky in the question of a dictatorship were not his apologists and\r\ndid not belong to the \"Revolutionary Democracy,\" but the mere fact of\r\ntheir appeal is sufficient proof that their motives could not have been\r\nreactionary, and that it reflected the sincere desire of the Russian\r\npatriotic elements to see a strong man at the helm in days of storm and\r\nstrife.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there may also have been another motive; there had been a short\r\nperiod, approximately in June, when not only the Russian public, but\r\nalso the officers had succumbed to the charm of the War Minister's\r\nimpassioned oratory and pathos. The Russian officers, who were being\r\nsacrificed wholesale, had forgotten and forgiven and were desperately\r\nhoping that he would save the Russian Army. And their promise to die in\r\nthe front line was by no means an empty one. During Kerensky's visits\r\nto the front, it was a painful sight to see these doomed men, their\r\neyes shining with exaltation, and their hearts beating with hope, a\r\nhope that was destined to be so bitterly and mercilessly disappointed.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that Kerensky, seeking in his book to justify the\r\ntemporary \"concentration of power\" which he assumed on August 27th,\r\nsays: \"In the struggle against the conspiracy conducted by a single\r\nwill, the State was compelled to set against it a will capable of\r\nresolute and quick action. No collective power, much less a Coalition,\r\ncan possess such a single will.\"\r\n\r\nI think that the internal condition of the Russian State threatened\r\nwith a monstrous joint conspiracy of the German General Staff and\r\nthe anti-national and anti-constitutional elements of the Russian\r\nexiles was sufficiently grave to warrant the demand for a strong power\r\n\"capable of resolute and quick action.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n    THE ACTIVITIES OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT--INTERNAL POLITICS,\r\n    CIVIL ADMINISTRATION--THE TOWN, THE VILLAGE AND THE AGRARIAN\r\n    PROBLEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nI will deal in this and in the subsequent chapters with the internal\r\ncondition of Russia in the first period of the Revolution only in\r\nso far as it affected the conduct of the World War. I have already\r\nmentioned the duality of the Supreme Administration of the country and\r\nthe incessant pressure of the Soviet upon the Provisional Government. A\r\nmember of the Duma, Mr. Shulgin, wittily remarked: \"The old régime is\r\ninterned in the fortress of Peter and Paul, and the new one is under\r\ndomiciliary arrest.\" The Provisional Government did not represent the\r\npeople as a whole; it could not and would not forestall the will of\r\nthe Constituent Assembly by introducing reforms which would shake the\r\npolitical and social structure of the State to its very foundations.\r\nIt proclaimed that \"not violence and compulsion, but the voluntary\r\nobedience of free citizens to the power which they had themselves\r\ncreated, constituted the foundation of the new administration of the\r\nState. Not a single drop of blood has been shed by the Provisional\r\nGovernment which has erected no barrier against the free expression\r\nof public opinion....\" This non-resistance to evil at the moment when\r\na fierce struggle, unfettered by moral or patriotic considerations,\r\nwas being conducted by some groups of the population for motives of\r\nself-preservation and by others for the attainment by violence of\r\nextreme demands, was undoubtedly a confession of impotence. In the\r\nsubsequent declarations of the second and third Coalition Governments\r\nmention was made \"of stringent measures\" against the forces of\r\ndisorganisation in the country. These words, however, were never\r\ntranslated into deeds.\r\n\r\nThe idea of not forestalling the will of the Constituent Assembly was\r\nnot carried out by the Government, especially in the domain of national\r\nself-determination. The Government proclaimed the independence of\r\nPoland, but made \"the consent to such alterations of the territory of\r\nthe Russian State as may be necessary for the creation of independent\r\nPoland\" dependent upon the All-Russian Constituent Assembly. That\r\nproclamation, the legal validity of which is contestable, was, however,\r\nin full accord with the juridical standpoint of society. With regard to\r\nFinland, the Government did not alter her legal status towards Russia,\r\nbut confirmed the rights and privileges of the country, cancelled all\r\nthe limitations of the Finnish Constitution and intended to convoke\r\nthe Finnish Chamber (\"Seim\") that was to confirm the new constitution\r\nof the Principality. The Government subsequently adhered to their\r\nintention to entertain favourably all the just demands of the Finns for\r\nlocal reconstruction. Nevertheless, both the Provisional Government and\r\nFinland were engaged in a protracted struggle for power on account of\r\nthe universal desire for the immediate satisfaction of the interests\r\nof the separate nationalities. On July 6th the Finnish Assembly passed\r\na law (by the majority of Social-Democratic votes) proclaiming the\r\nassumption by that body of supreme power after the abdication \"of\r\nthe Finnish Grand-Duke\" (the official title of the Russian Emperor).\r\nOnly foreign affairs, military legislation and administration were\r\nleft to the Provisional Government. This decision corresponded to a\r\ncertain degree with the resolution of the Congress of Soviets, which\r\ndemanded that full independence should be granted to Finland before\r\nthe convocation of the Constituent Assembly, with the above-mentioned\r\nrestrictions. The Russian Government answered this declaration of\r\nthe actual independence of Finland by dissolving the Assembly, which\r\nmet, however, once again in September of its own free will. In this\r\nstruggle, the intensity of which varied according to the rise and fall\r\nof the political barometer in Petrograd, the Finnish politicians,\r\ndisregarding the interests of the State and having no support\r\nwhatsoever in the Army, counted exclusively upon the loyalty or, to\r\nbe more correct, the weakness of the Provisional Government. Matters\r\nnever reached the stage of open rebellion. The conscious elements of\r\nthe population kept the country within the limits of reasonableness,\r\nnot out of loyalty, but perhaps because they feared the consequences\r\nof civil war and especially of the sabotage in which the licentious\r\nsoldiers and sailors would have presumably indulged.\r\n\r\nMay and June were spent in a struggle for power between the Government\r\nand the self-appointed Central Rada (Assembly). The All-Ukrainian\r\nMilitary Congress, also convened arbitrarily on June 8th, demanded\r\nthat the Government should immediately comply with all the demands\r\nof the Central Rada and the Congresses, and suggested that the Rada\r\nshould cease to address the Government, but should begin at once\r\nto organise the autonomous administration of the Ukraine. On June\r\n11th the autonomous Constitution of the Ukraine was adopted and a\r\nSecretariat (Council of Ministers) formed under the chairmanship\r\nof Mr. Vinnichenko. After the Government envoys--the Ministers\r\nKerensky, Tereschenko and Tzeretelli--had negotiated with the Rada, a\r\nproclamation was issued on July 2nd, which forestalled the decision of\r\nthe Constituent Assembly and proclaimed the autonomy of the Ukraine\r\nwith certain restrictions. The Central Rada and the Secretariat were\r\ngradually seizing the administration, creating a dual power on the spot\r\nand discrediting the All-Russian Government. They thus provoked civil\r\nstrife and provided moral excuses for every endeavor to shirk civic\r\nand military duties to the common Mother Country. The Central Rada,\r\nmoreover, contained from the outset sympathisers with Germany and was\r\nundoubtedly connected through the \"Union for the Liberation of the\r\nUkraine\" with the headquarters of the Central Powers. Bearing in mind\r\nthe ample material collected by the Stavka, Vinnichenko's half-hearted\r\nconfession to a French correspondent (?) with regard to Germanophil\r\ntendencies in the Rada, and finally the report of the Procurator of the\r\nKiev Court of Appeal at the end of August, 1917, I cannot doubt that\r\nthe Rada played a criminal part. The Procurator complained that the\r\ncomplete destruction of the machinery of intelligence and of criminal\r\ninvestigation deprived the Government prosecutors of the possibility\r\nof investigating the situation; he said that not only German espionage\r\nand propaganda, but the mutinies of the Ukrainian troops, as well as\r\nthe destination of obscure funds of undoubted Austro-German origin ...\r\ncould be traced to the Rada.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Ministry of the Interior, which, in the old days, practically\r\ncontrolled the Autocracy and provoked universal hatred, now went to the\r\nother extreme. It all but abolished itself, and the functions of that\r\nbranch of the administration were divided among local, self-appointed\r\norganisations. The history of the organs of the Ministry of the\r\nInterior is, in many ways, similar to the fate of the Supreme Command.\r\nOn March 5th the Minister-President issued an order for the suppression\r\nof the offices of Governor and of Inspector of Police (\"Ispravnik\"),\r\nwhich were to be replaced by the presidents of the Provincial and\r\nDistrict self-governing Councils (\"Oupravas\"), and for the police\r\nto be replaced by a militia organised by Social Institutions. This\r\nmeasure, adopted owing to the universal dislike for the agents of\r\nthe old régime, was, in fact, the only actual manifestation of the\r\nGovernment's will; because the status of the Commissars was not\r\nestablished by law until the month of September. The instructions and\r\norders of the Government were, on the whole, of an academic nature,\r\nbecause life followed its own course, and was regulated, or, to be more\r\ncorrect, muddled up, by local revolutionary changes of the law. The\r\noffice of Government Commissars became a sinecure from the very outset.\r\nThey had no power or authority, and became entirely dependent upon\r\nrevolutionary organisations. When the latter passed a vote of censure\r\nupon the activities of a Commissar, he could practically do nothing\r\nmore. The organisations elected a new one, and his confirmation in\r\noffice by the Provisional Government was a mere formality. In the first\r\nsix weeks seventeen Provincial Commissars and a great many District\r\nCommissars were thus removed. Later, in July, Tzeretelli, during his\r\ntenure of the office of Minister of the Interior, which lasted for a\r\nfortnight, gave official sanction to this procedure and sent a circular\r\nto the Local Soviets and Committees, inviting them to send in to him\r\nthe names of desirable candidates, which were to replace the unsuitable\r\nones. Thus there remained no representatives of the Central power on\r\nthe spot. In the beginning of the Revolution the so-called \"Social\r\nCommittees\" or \"Soviets of Social Organisation\" really represented\r\na social Institution comprising the union of towns and _Zemstvos_,\r\nof Municipal Dumas, professional Unions, Co-operatives, Magistrates,\r\netc. Things went from bad to worse when these Social Committees were\r\ndissolved into class and party organisations. Local power passed into\r\nthe hands of the Soviets of Workmen and Soldiers and in places before\r\nthe law had been produced to \"democratised\" Socialistic Dumas, closely\r\nreminiscent of semi-Bolshevik Soviets.\r\n\r\nThe regulations issued by the Government on April 15th, on the\r\norganisation of Municipal Self-Government, comprised the following main\r\npoints:\r\n\r\n    (1) All citizens of both sexes, having attained the age of twenty,\r\n    were given the suffrage in the town.\r\n\r\n    (2) No domiciliary qualification was established.\r\n\r\n    (3) A proportional system of elections was introduced.\r\n\r\n    (4) The Military were given the suffrage in the localities in which\r\n    the respective garrisons were quartered.\r\n\r\nI will not examine in detail these regulations, which are probably the\r\nmost Democratic ever known in Municipal Law, because the experience\r\ngained in their application was too short to afford any ground for\r\ndiscussion. I will only note one phenomenon which accompanied the\r\nintroduction of these regulations in the autumn of 1917. The free vote\r\nin many places became a mockery. Throughout the length and breadth of\r\nRussia, all the non-Socialist and politically neutral parties were\r\nunder suspicion and were subjected to persecution. They were not\r\nallowed to conduct propaganda, and their meetings were dispersed.\r\nElectioneering was characterised by blatant abuses. Occasionally\r\nelection agents were subjected to violence and lists of candidates\r\ndestroyed. At the same time the licentious and demoralised soldiery\r\nof many garrisons--chance guests in the town in which, as often as\r\nnot, they had only appeared a day or two before--rushed to the polls\r\nand presented lists drawn up by the extreme Anti-National parties.\r\nThere were cases when military units, arriving after the elections,\r\ndemanded a re-election and accompanied this demand by threats and\r\nsometimes murders. There can be no doubt that, among the circumstances\r\nthat affected the August elections in Petrograd to the Municipal Duma,\r\nto which sixty-seven Bolsheviks out of two hundred were elected, the\r\npresence in the Capital of numerous demoralised garrisons was not the\r\nleast important. The authorities were silent because they were absent.\r\nThe _Petite Bourgeoisie_, the intellectual workers, in a word, the Town\r\nDemocracy in the widest sense, was the weakest party and was always\r\ndefeated in that Revolutionary struggle. The mutinies, rebellions,\r\nand separations of various Republics--the precursors of the bloody\r\nSoviet Régime--had the most painful effect on the life of that portion\r\nof the community. The \"self-determination\" of the soldiers caused\r\nuneasiness and even fear of unrestricted violence. Even travelling\r\nwas unsafe and difficult, because the railways fell into the hands of\r\ndeserters. The \"self-determination\" of the workmen resulted in the\r\nimpossibility of obtaining supplies of the most necessary commodities,\r\nowing to a tremendous rise in prices. The \"self-determination\" of the\r\nvillages produced a stoppage of supplies, and the villages were thus\r\nleft to starve; not to mention the moral ordeal of the class which was\r\nsubjected to insults and degradation. The Revolution had raised hopes\r\nfor the betterment of the conditions of life for everyone except the\r\n_Bourgeois_ Democracy, because even the moral conquests proclaimed\r\nby the new Revolutionary power--liberty of speech, of the Press and\r\nof meetings, etc.--soon belonged exclusively to the Revolutionary\r\nDemocracy. The upper _Bourgeoisie_ (intellectually superior) was\r\norganised to a certain extent by means of the Constitutional Democratic\r\nParty, but the _Petite Bourgeoisie_ (the _Bourgeois_ Democracy) had\r\nno organisation whatsoever and no means for an organised struggle.\r\nThe Democratic Municipalities were losing their true Democratic\r\naspect--not as a result of the new Municipal law, but of Revolutionary\r\npractice--and became mere class organs of the Proletariat, or the\r\nrepresentatives of purely Socialistic parties, completely out of touch\r\nwith the people.\r\n\r\nSelf-government in the districts and in the villages in the first\r\nperiod of the Revolution was of more or less the same nature. Towards\r\nthe autumn there should have been a Democratic system of _Zemstvo_\r\nAdministration, on the same basis as that in the municipalities.\r\nThe District (Volost) _Zemstvo_ was to undertake the administration\r\nof local agriculture, education, order and safety. As a matter\r\nof fact, the villages were administered--if such a word can be\r\napplied to Anarchy--by a complex agglomeration of revolutionary\r\norganisations, such as peasant Congresses, Supply and Land Committees,\r\nPopular Soviets, Village Councils, etc. Very often another peculiar\r\norganisation--that of the deserters--dominated them all. At any rate,\r\nthe All-Russian Union of Peasants agreed with the following declaration\r\nmade by the left wing: \"All our work for the organisation of various\r\nCommittees will be of no avail if these Social Organisations are to\r\nremain under the constant threat of being terrorised by accidental\r\narmed bands.\"\r\n\r\nThe only question that deeply perturbed the minds of the peasantry\r\nand overshadowed all other events, was the old, painful, traditional\r\nquestion:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE QUESTION OF THE LAND.\r\n\r\nIt was an exceptionally complex and tangled question. It arose more\r\nthan once in the shape of fruitless mutinies, which were ruthlessly\r\nsuppressed. The wave of agrarian troubles which swept over Russia in\r\nthe years of the First Revolution (1905-6) and left a trail of fire\r\nand ruined estates was an indication of the consequences that were\r\nbound to follow the Revolution of 1917. It is difficult to form an\r\nexhaustive idea of the motives which prompted the land-owners to defend\r\ntheir rights so stubbornly and so energetically: was it atavism, a\r\nnatural yearning for the land, statesmanlike considerations as to the\r\ndesirability of increasing the productivity of the land by introducing\r\nhigher methods of agriculture, a desire to maintain a direct influence\r\nover the people, or was it merely selfishness?... One thing is\r\ncertain--the agrarian reforms were overdue. Retribution could not fail\r\nto overtake the Government and the Ruling Classes for the long years of\r\npoverty, oppression, and, what is most important, the incredible moral\r\nand intellectual darkness in which the peasant masses were kept, their\r\neducation being entirely neglected.\r\n\r\nThe peasants demanded that all land should be surrendered to them, and\r\nwould not wait for the decision of the Central Land Committee or of the\r\nConstituent Assembly. This impatience was undoubtedly due, to a great\r\nextent, to the weakness of the Government and to outside influences,\r\nwhich will be described later. There was no divergence of opinion as\r\nto the fundamental idea of the reforms. The Liberal Democracy and\r\nthe _Bourgeoisie_, the Revolutionary Democracy and the Provisional\r\nGovernment, all spoke quite definitely about \"handing the land over to\r\nthe workers.\" With the same unanimity these elements favoured the idea\r\nof leaving the final decision on the reform of the land and legislation\r\non the subject to the Constituent Assembly. This irreconcilable\r\ndivergence of opinion arose by reason of the very essence of land\r\nreform. Liberal circles in Russia stood for the private ownership of\r\nthe land--an idea which found increasing favour with the peasants--and\r\ndemanded that the peasants should receive allotments rather than that\r\nthe land should be entirely redistributed. On the other hand, the\r\nRevolutionary Democracy advocated, at all meetings of every party,\r\nclass and profession, the adoption of the Resolution of the All-Russian\r\nCongress of Peasants, which was passed on May 25th, with the approval\r\nof the Minister Tchernov on \"the transfer of all lands ... _to the\r\npeople as a whole, as their patrimony, on the basis of equal possession\r\nwithout any payment_.\" The peasants did not or would not understand\r\nthis Social Revolutionary Resolution, which caused dissensions. The\r\npeasants were private owners by nature and could not understand the\r\nprinciple of nationalisation. The principle of equal possession meant\r\nthat many millions of peasants, whose allotments were larger than the\r\nnormal, would lose their surplus allotments, and the whole question\r\nof the redistribution of the land would lead to endless civil war;\r\nbecause there were innumerable peasants who had no land at all, and\r\nonly 45,000,000 dessiatines of arable land which did not belong to the\r\npeasants to divide among 20,000,000 peasant households.\r\n\r\nThe Provisional Government did not consider itself entitled to solve\r\nthe land problem. Under the pressure of the masses, it transferred\r\nits rights partly to the Ministry of Agriculture, partly to the\r\nCentral Land Committee, which was organised on the basis of broad,\r\ndemocratic representation. The latter was entrusted with the task of\r\ncollecting data and of drawing up a scheme of land reform, as well\r\nas of regulating the existing conditions with regard to the land. In\r\npractice, the use of the land transfer, rent, employment of labour,\r\netc., were dealt with by the Local Land Committees. These bodies\r\ncontained illiterate elements--the intellectuals as a rule were\r\nexcluded--which had selfish motives and had no perception either of the\r\nextent or of the limits of their powers. The Central Representative\r\nInstitutions and the Ministry of Agriculture, under Tchernov, issued\r\nappeals against arbitrariness and for the preservation of the land,\r\npending the decision of the Constituent Assembly. At the same time\r\nthey overtly encouraged \"temporary possession of the land,\" as seizure\r\nof the land was then described, on the excuse that the Government\r\nwere obliged to sell as much land as possible. The propaganda that\r\nwas conducted on a large scale in the villages by irresponsible\r\nrepresentatives of Socialist and Anarchist circles completed Tchernov's\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe results of this policy were soon apparent. In one of his circulars\r\nto Provincial Commissars, the Minister of the Interior, Tzeretelli,\r\nadmitted that complete anarchy reigned in the villages: \"Land is being\r\nseized and sold, agricultural labourers are forced to stop working, and\r\nlandowners are faced with demands which are economically impossible.\r\nBreeding stock is being destroyed and implements plundered. Model farms\r\nare being ruined. Forests are being cut down irrespective of ownership,\r\ntimber and logs are being stolen, and their shipment prevented. No\r\nsowing is done on privately-owned farms, and harvests of grain and hay\r\nare not reaped.\" The Minister accused the Local Committees and the\r\nPeasant Congresses of organising arbitrary seizures of the land, and\r\ncame to the conclusion that the existing conditions of agriculture and\r\nforestry \"would inevitably bring about endless calamities for the Army\r\nand the country, and threatened the very existence of the State.\" If\r\nwe recall the fires, the murders, the lynchings, the destruction of\r\nestates, which were often filled with treasures of great historical\r\nand artistic value, we shall have a true picture of the life of the\r\nvillages in those days.\r\n\r\nThe question of the ownership of the land by the landlords was thus\r\nnot merely a matter of selfish class interest, all the more as, not\r\nonly the landlords but the wealthy peasants were subjected to violence\r\nby order of the Committees, and in spite of them. One village rose\r\nagainst another. It was not a question of the transfer of riches\r\nfrom one class or individual to another, but of the destruction of\r\ntreasures, of agriculture, and of the economic stability of the State.\r\nThe instincts of proprietorship inherent in the peasantry irresistibly\r\ngrew as these seizures and partitions took place. The mental attitude\r\nof the peasantry upset all the plans of the Revolutionary Democracy.\r\nBy converting the peasants into a _Petite Bourgeoisie_, it threatened\r\nto postpone to an indefinite date the triumph of Socialism. The\r\nvillagers were obsessed by the idea of land distribution and by\r\ntheir own interests, and were not in the least concerned with the\r\nWar, with politics, or with social questions which did not directly\r\naffect them. The workers of the village were being killed and maimed\r\nat the front, and the village, therefore, considered the War as a\r\nburden. The authorities disallowed seizures of the land and imposed\r\nrestrictions in the shape of monopolies and fixed prices for corn. The\r\npeasantry, therefore, bore a grudge against the Government. The towns\r\nceased to supply manufactured goods and the villages were estranged\r\nfrom the towns and ceased to supply them with grain. This was the only\r\nreal \"conquest\" made by the Revolution, and those who profited by it\r\ngrew very anxious as to the attitude of future Governments towards\r\nthe arbitrary solution of the land question. They therefore actively\r\nencouraged anarchy in the villages, condoned seizures and undermined\r\nthe authority of the Provisional Government. By this means they hoped\r\nto bring the peasants over to their side as supporters, or, at least,\r\nas a neutral element, in the impending decisive struggle for power.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe abolition of the police by the order issued on April 17th was one\r\nof the acts of the Government which seriously complicated the normal\r\ncourse of life. In reality, this act only confirmed the conditions\r\nwhich had arisen almost everywhere in the first days of the Revolution,\r\nand were directly due to the wrath of the people against the Executive\r\nof the old regime, and especially of those who had been oppressed and\r\npersecuted by the police and had suddenly found themselves on the crest\r\nof the wave. It would be a hopeless task to defend the Russian police\r\nas an institution. It could only be considered good by comparing it\r\nwith the militia and with the Extraordinary Bolshevik Commission....\r\n\r\nIn any case it would have been useless to resist the abolition of the\r\npolice, because it was a psychological necessity. There can be no\r\ndoubt that the attitude and actions of the old police were due less to\r\ntheir political opinions than to the instructions of their employers\r\nand to their own personal interests. No wonder, therefore, that the\r\ngendarmes and the policemen, insulted and persecuted, introduced a\r\nvery bad element into the Army, into which they were subsequently\r\nforcibly drafted. The Revolutionary Democracy, in self defence, grossly\r\nexaggerated their counter-revolutionary activities in the Army;\r\nnevertheless, it is absolutely true that a great many ex-officers of\r\nthe police and of the gendarmerie, partly, perhaps, from motives of\r\nself-defence, chose for themselves a most lucrative profession--that\r\nof the demagogue and the agitator. The fact is that the abolition of\r\nthe police in the very midst of the turmoil--when crime was on the\r\nincrease and the guarantees of public safety and of the safety of\r\nindividual property were weakened--was a real calamity. The militia,\r\nindeed, far from being a substitute for the police, was a caricature\r\nof them. In Western countries the police is placed as a united force\r\nunder the orders of a Department of the Central Government. The\r\nProvisional Government placed the militia under the orders of _Zemstvo_\r\nand Municipal Administrations. The Government Commissars were only\r\nentitled to make use of the militia for certain definite purposes. The\r\ncadres of the militia were filled by untrained men, devoid of technical\r\nexperience, and, as often as not, criminals. By virtue of the new\r\nlaw, there were admitted to the militia persons under arrest or who\r\nhad served a term of imprisonment for comparatively grave offences.\r\nThe system of recruiting practised by some forcibly \"democratised\"\r\n_Zemstvo_ and Municipal institutions tended quite as much as the new\r\nlaw towards the deterioration of the personnel of the militia.\r\n\r\nThe Chief of the Central Administration of the Militia himself admitted\r\nthat escaped convicts were sometimes placed in command of the militia.\r\nThe villages were sometimes without any militia at all, and they\r\nadministered themselves as best they could.\r\n\r\nIn its proclamation of April 25th the Provisional Government gave\r\nan accurate description of the condition of the country in stating\r\nthat \"the growth of new social ties was slower than the process of\r\ndisruption caused by the collapse of the old régime.\" In every feature\r\nof the life of the people this fact was clearly to be observed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n    THE ACTIVITIES OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT: FOOD SUPPLIES,\r\n    INDUSTRY, TRANSPORT AND FINANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the early spring of 1917 the deficiency in supplies for the Army\r\nand for the towns was rapidly growing. In one of its appeals to the\r\npeasants the Soviet said: \"The enemies of freedom, the supporters of\r\nthe deposed Czar, are taking advantage of the shortage of food in\r\nthe towns _for which they are themselves responsible_ in order to\r\nundermine your freedom and ours. They say that the Revolution has\r\nleft the country without bread....\" This simple explanation, adduced\r\nby the Revolutionary Democracy in every crisis, was, of course,\r\none-sided. There was the inheritance of the old régime as well as the\r\ninevitable consequences of three years of war, during which imports\r\nof agricultural implements had come to a standstill, labourers were\r\ntaken from the land, and, as a result, the area under crops was\r\ndiminished. But these were not the only reasons for the food shortage\r\nin a fertile country--a shortage which in the autumn was considered by\r\nthe Government as disastrous. The food policy of the Government and\r\nthe fluctuation of prices, the depreciation of the currency and a rise\r\nin the price of commodities entirely out of proportion to the fixed\r\nprices for grain also largely contributed to this result. This rise\r\nin prices was due to general economic conditions, and especially to a\r\nvery rapid rise in wages; to the agrarian policy of the Government, the\r\ninadequacy of the area under crops, to the turmoil in the villages,\r\nand to the breakdown of transport. Private trade was abolished and\r\nthe entire matter of food supplies was handed over to Food Supply\r\nCommittees--undoubtedly democratic in character, but, with the\r\nexception of the representatives of the Co-operatives, inexperienced\r\nand devoid of a creative spirit. There are many more reasons, great and\r\nsmall, which may be included in the formula: The Old Régime, the War\r\nand the Revolution.\r\n\r\nOn March 29th the Provisional Government introduced the grain monopoly.\r\nThe entire surplus of grain, excluding normal supplies, seed corn and\r\nfodder, reverted to the State. At the same time the Government once\r\nagain raised the fixed price of grain, and promised to introduce fixed\r\nprices for all necessary commodities, such as iron, textiles, leather,\r\nkerosine oil, etc. This last measure, which was universally recognised\r\nas just, and to which the Minister of Supplies attributed a very great\r\nimportance, proved impossible of application owing to the confused\r\ncondition of the country. Russia was covered by a huge network of Food\r\nSupply Institutions, which cost 500,000,000 roubles a year, but could\r\nnot cope with their work. The villages, on the other hand, had ceased\r\nto pay taxes and rents, were flooded with paper money, for which they\r\ncould get no equivalent in manufactured goods, and were by no means\r\nanxious to supply grain. Propaganda and appeals were of no avail, and,\r\nas often as not, force had to be applied.\r\n\r\nIn its Proclamation of August 29th the Government admitted that the\r\nCountry was in a desperate position; the Government stores were\r\nemptying; towns, provinces, and armies at the Front were in dire\r\nneed of bread, _although, in fact, there was sufficient bread in\r\nthe country_. Some had not delivered last year's harvest; some were\r\nagitating and preventing others from doing their duty. In order to\r\navert grave danger, the Government once more raised the fixed prices\r\nand threatened to apply stringent measures against the offenders, and\r\nto regulate prices and the distribution of articles required by the\r\nvillages. But the vicious circle of conflicting political, social and\r\nclass interests was narrowing, like to a tight noose, round the neck of\r\nthe Government, paralysing its will-power and energy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe condition of industry was no less acute, and it was steadily\r\nfalling into ruin. Here, as in the matter of supplies, the calamity\r\ncannot be ascribed to one set of causes, as happened when the employers\r\nand the workmen levelled accusations against one another. The former\r\nwere charged with taking excessive profits and having recourse to\r\nsabotage in order to upset the Revolution, while the latter were\r\nblamed for slackness and greed and for deriving selfish gains from the\r\nRevolution. The causes may be divided into three categories.\r\n\r\nOwing to various political and economic reasons and to the fact\r\nthat the old Government did not devote sufficient attention to the\r\ndevelopment of the natural resources of the country, our industries\r\nwere not placed on a solid basis, and were to a great extent dependent\r\nupon foreign markets even for such material as might easily have been\r\nfound in Russia. Thus in 1912 there was a serious shortage of pig-iron,\r\nand in 1913 of fuel. From 1908 to 1913 imports of metals from abroad\r\nrose from 29 to 34 per cent. Before the War we imported 48 per cent.\r\nof cotton. We needed 2,750,000 pouds[18] of wool from abroad out of a\r\ntotal of the 5,000,000 pouds produced.\r\n\r\nThe War unquestionably affected industry very deeply. Normal imports\r\ncame to a standstill. The mines of Dombrovsk were lost. Owing to\r\nstrategical requirements, transport was weakened, supplies of fuel and\r\nof raw materials diminished. Most of the factories had to work for\r\nthe Army, and their personnel was curtailed by mobilisations. From an\r\neconomic point of view, the militarisation of industry was a heavy\r\nburden for the population, because, according to the estimates made\r\nby one of the Ministers, the Army absorbed 40 to 50 per cent. of the\r\ntotal of goods produced by the country. Finally, the War widened the\r\ngulf between the employers and the workmen, as the former made immense\r\nprofits, whereas the latter were impoverished, and their condition was\r\nfurther aggravated by the suspension of certain professional guarantees\r\non account of the War by the fact that certain categories of workmen\r\nwere drafted by conscription to definite industrial concerns, and by\r\nthe general burden of inflated prices and inadequate food supplies.\r\n\r\nEven in these abnormal circumstances Russian industries to some extent\r\nfulfilled the requirements of the moment, but the Revolution dealt\r\nthem a death blow, which caused their gradual dislocation and ultimate\r\ncollapse. On the one hand, the Provisional Government was legislating\r\nfor the establishment of a strict Government control of the industries\r\nof the country and for regulating them by heavily taxing profits and\r\nexcess war profits, as well as by Government distribution of fuel, raw\r\nmaterials and food. The latter measure caused the trading class to be\r\npractically eliminated and to be replaced by democratic organisations.\r\nWhether excess profits disappeared as a result of this policy, or were\r\nmerely transferred to another class, it is not easy to decide. On the\r\nother hand, the Government were deeply concerned with the protection\r\nof labour, and were drafting and passing various laws concerning the\r\nfreedom of unions, labour exchanges, conciliation boards, social\r\ninsurance, etc. Unfortunately, the impatience and the desire for\r\n\"law-making\" which had seized the villages were also apparent in the\r\nfactories. Heads of industrial concerns were dismissed wholesale, as\r\nwell as the administrative and technical staffs. These dismissals were\r\naccompanied by insults and sometimes by violence, out of revenge for\r\npast offences, real or imaginary. Some of the members of the staffs\r\nresigned of their own accord, because they were unable to endure the\r\nhumiliating position into which they were forced by the workmen. Given\r\nour low level of technical and educational standards, such methods\r\nwere fraught with grave danger. As in the Army, so in the factories,\r\nCommittees replaced by elections the dismissed personnel with utterly\r\nuntrained and ignorant men. Sometimes the workmen completely seized the\r\nindustrial concerns. Ignorant and unprovided with capital, they led\r\nthese concerns to ruin, and were themselves driven to unemployment and\r\nmisery. Labour discipline in the factories completely vanished, and no\r\nmeans was left of exercising moral, material or judicial pressure or\r\ncompulsion. The \"consciousness\" alone of the workers proved inadequate.\r\nThe technical and administrative personnel which remained or was newly\r\nelected could no longer direct the industries and enjoyed no authority,\r\nas it was thoroughly terrorised by the workmen. Naturally, therefore,\r\nthe working hours were still further curtailed, work became careless,\r\nand production fell to its lowest ebb. The metallurgical industries\r\nof Moscow fell 32 per cent. and the productivity of the Petrograd\r\nfactories 20 to 40 per cent. as early as in the month of April. In\r\nJune the production of coal and the general production of the Donetz\r\nbasin fell 30 per cent. The production of oil in Baku and Grozni\r\nalso suffered. The greatest injury, however, was inflicted upon the\r\nindustries by the monstrous demands for higher wages, completely out of\r\nproportion to the cost of living and to the productivity of labour, as\r\nwell as to the actual paying capacity of the industries. These demands\r\ngreatly exceeded all excess profits. The following figures are quoted\r\nin a Report to the Provisional Government: In eighteen concerns in the\r\nDonetz Basin, with a total profit of 75,000,000 roubles per annum, the\r\nworkmen demanded a wage increase of 240,000,000 roubles per annum; the\r\ntotal amount of increased wages in all the mining and metallurgical\r\nfactories of the South was 800,000,000 roubles per annum. In the Urals\r\nthe total Budget was 200,000,000, while the wages rose to 300,000,000.\r\nIn the Putilov factory alone, in Petrograd, before the end of 1917, the\r\nincrease in wages amounted to 90,000,000 roubles. The wages rose from\r\n200 to 300 per cent. The increase in the wages of the textile workers\r\nof Moscow rose 500 per cent., as compared to 1914. The burden of these\r\nincreases naturally fell on the Government, as most of the factories\r\nwere working for the defence of the country. Owing to the condition\r\nof industry described above, and to the psychology of the workmen,\r\nindustrial concerns collapsed, and the country experienced an acute\r\nshortage of necessary commodities, with a corresponding increase in\r\nprices. Hence the rise in the price of bread and the reluctance of the\r\nvillages to supply the towns.\r\n\r\nAt the same time Bolshevism introduced a permanent ferment into\r\nthe labouring masses. It flattered the lowest instincts, fanned\r\nhatred against the wealthy classes, encouraged excessive demands,\r\nand paralysed every endeavour of the Government and of the moderate\r\nDemocratic organisations to arrest the disruption of industry: \"All\r\nfor the Proletariat and through the Proletariat....\" Bolshevism held\r\nup to the working class vivid and entrancing vistas of political\r\ndomination and economic prosperity, through the destruction of the\r\nCapitalist régime and the transfer to the workmen of political power,\r\nof industries, of the means of production, and of the wealth of the\r\ncountry. And all this was to come at once, immediately, and not as a\r\nresult of a lengthy, social, economic process and organised struggle.\r\nThe imagination of the masses, unfettered by knowledge or by the\r\nauthority of leading professional unions, which were morally undermined\r\nby the Bolsheviks, and were on the verge of collapse, was fired by\r\nvisions of avenging the hardships and boredom of heavy toil in the\r\npast, and of enjoying amenities of a _Bourgeois_ existence, which they\r\ndespised and yet yearned for with equal ardour. It was \"Now or Never:\r\nAll or Nothing!\" As life was destroying illusions, and the implacable\r\nlaw of economics was meting out the punishment of high prices, hunger\r\nand unemployment, Bolshevism was the more convincingly insisting upon\r\nthe necessity of rebellion and explaining the causes of the calamity\r\nand the means of averting it. The causes were: the policy of the\r\nProvisional Government, which was trying to reintroduce enslavement by\r\nthe Bourgeoisie, the sabotage of the employers, and the connivance of\r\nthe Revolutionary Democracy, including the Mensheviks, which had sold\r\nitself to the Bourgeoisie. The means was the transfer of power to the\r\nProletariat.\r\n\r\nAll these circumstances were gradually killing Russian Industry.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all these disturbances, the dislocation of industry was\r\nnot immediately felt in the Army to an appreciable degree, because\r\nattention was concentrated upon the Army at the expense of the vital\r\nnecessities of the country itself, and also because for several months\r\nthere had been a lull at the Front. In June, 1917, therefore, we were\r\nprovided adequately, if not amply, for an important offensive. Imports\r\nof war material through Archangel, Murmansk, and partly through\r\nVladivostok had increased, but had not been sufficiently developed by\r\nreason of the natural shortcomings of maritime routes, and of the low\r\ncarrying capacity of the Siberian and of the Murmansk Railways. Only 16\r\nper cent. of the actual needs of the Army were satisfied. The military\r\nadministration, however, clearly saw that we were living on the old\r\nstores collected by the patriotic impulse and effort of the country in\r\n1916. By August, 1917, the most important factories for the production\r\nof war materials had suffered a check. The production of guns and\r\nof shells had fallen 60 per cent., and of aircraft 80 per cent. The\r\npossibility of continuing the War under worse material conditions\r\nwas, however, amply proved later by the Soviet Government, which had\r\nbeen using the supplies available in 1917 and the remnants of Russian\r\nIndustrial production for the conduct of civil war for more than three\r\nyears. This, of course, was only possible through such an unexampled\r\ncurtailment of the consuming market that we are practically driven back\r\nto primitive conditions of life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTransport was likewise in a state of dislocation. As early as May,\r\n1917, at the Regular Congress of Railway Representatives at the Stavka,\r\nthe opinion was expressed, and confirmed by many specialists, that,\r\nunless the general conditions of the country changed, our railways\r\nwould come to a standstill within six months. Practice has disproved\r\ntheory. For over three years, under the impossible conditions of Civil\r\nWar and of the Bolshevik Régime, the railways have continued to work.\r\nIt is true that they did not satisfy the needs of the population\r\neven in a small measure, but they served the strategical purposes.\r\nThat this situation cannot last, and that the entire network of the\r\nRussian Railways is approaching its doom, is hardly open to doubt. In\r\nthe history of the disintegration of the Russian Railway System the\r\nsame conditions are traceable which I have mentioned in regard to the\r\nArmy, the villages, and especially the industries: the inheritance of\r\nthe unwise policy of the past in regard to railways, the excessive\r\ndemands of the War, the wear and tear of rolling stock, and anarchy on\r\nthe line, due to the behaviour of a licentious soldiery; the general\r\neconomic condition of the country, the shortage of rails, of metal and\r\nof fuel; the \"democratisation\" of Railway Administration, in which\r\nthe power was seized by various Committees; the disorganisation of\r\nthe administrative and technical personnel, which was subjected to\r\npersecution; the low producing power of labour and the steady growth\r\nof the economic demands of the railway employees and workmen.\r\n\r\nIn other branches of the Administration the Government offered a\r\ncertain resistance to the systematic seizure of power by private\r\norganisations, but in the Ministry of Railways that pernicious system\r\nwas introduced by the Government itself, in the person of the Minister\r\nNekrassov. He was the friend and the inspirer of Kerensky, alternately\r\nMinister of Railways and of Finance, Assistant and Vice-President of\r\nthe Council of Ministers, Governor-General of Finland, Octobrist, Cadet\r\n(Constitutional Democrat), and Radical Democrat, holding the scales\r\nbetween the Government and the Soviet. Nekrassov was the darkest and\r\nthe most fatal figure in the Governing Circles, and left the stamp\r\nof destruction upon everything he touched--the All-Russian Executive\r\nCommittee of the Union of Railways, the autonomy of the Ukraine, or the\r\nKornilov movement.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry had no economic or technical plan. As a matter of fact,\r\nno such plan could ever be carried out, because Nekrassov decided to\r\nintroduce into the Railway Organisation, hitherto strongly disciplined,\r\n\"the new principles of Democratic Organisation, instead of the old\r\nwatchwords of compulsion and fear\"(?). Soviets and Committees were\r\nimplanted upon every branch of the Railway Administration. Enormous\r\nsums were spent upon this undertaking, and, by his famous circular of\r\nMay 27th, the Minister assigned to these organisations a very wide\r\nscope of control and management, as well as of the \"direction\" which\r\nthey were henceforward entitled to give to the responsible personnel\r\nin the Administration. Executive functions were subsequently promised\r\nto these organisations.... \"Meanwhile the Ministry of Railways and its\r\nsubordinate branches will work in strict accordance with the ideas\r\nand wishes of the United Railway Workers.\" Nekrassov thus handed\r\nover to a private organisation the most important interests of the\r\nState--the direction of the Railway policy, the control of the Defence,\r\nof industries, and of all other branches dependent upon the railway\r\nsystem. As one of our contemporary critics has said, this measure\r\nwould have been entirely justified had the whole population of Russia\r\nconsisted of railway employees. This reform, carried out by Nekrassov\r\non a scale unprecedented in history, was something worse than a mere\r\nblunder. The general trend of Ministerial policy was well understood.\r\nIn the beginning of August, at the Moscow Congress, which was turned\r\ninto a weapon for the Socialist parties of the Left, one of the leaders\r\ndeclared that \"the Railway Union must be fully autonomous and no\r\nauthority except that of the workers themselves should be entitled to\r\ninterfere with it.\" In other words, a State within a State.\r\n\r\nDisruption ensued. A new phase of the arbitrariness of ever-changing\r\norganisations was introduced into the strict and precise mechanism of\r\nthe railway services in the centre as well as throughout the country.\r\nI understand the democratisation that opens to the popular masses\r\nwide access to science, technical knowledge, and art, but I do not\r\nunderstand the democratisation of these achievements of human intellect.\r\n\r\nThere followed anarchy and the collapse of Labour discipline. As early\r\nas in July the position of the railways was rendered hopeless through\r\nthe action of the Government.\r\n\r\nAfter holding the office of Minister of Railways for four months,\r\nNekrassov went to the Ministry of Finance, of which he was utterly\r\nignorant, and his successor, Yurenev, began to struggle against\r\nthe usurpation of power by the railwaymen, as he considered \"the\r\ninterference of private persons and organisations with the executive\r\nfunctions of the Department as a crime against the State.\" The struggle\r\nwas conducted by the customary methods of the Provisional Government,\r\nand what was lost could no longer be recovered. At the Moscow Congress\r\nthe President of the Union of the Railwaymen, fully conscious of its\r\npower, said that the struggle against democratic organisations was a\r\nmanifestation of counter-Revolution, that the Union would use every\r\nweapon in order to counteract these endeavours, and \"would be strong\r\nenough to slay this counter-Revolutionary hydra.\" As is well known, the\r\nAll-Russian Executive Committee of the Union of Railways subsequently\r\nbecame a political organisation pure and simple, and betrayed\r\nKornilov to Kerensky and Kerensky to Lenin. With a zeal worthy of the\r\nsecret police of the old régime, it hunted out Kornilov's followers,\r\nand finally met an inglorious end in the clutches of Bolshevik\r\nCentralisation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe now come to another element in the life of the State--Finance. Every\r\nnormal financial system is dependent upon a series of conditions:\r\ngeneral political conditions, offering a guarantee of the external\r\nand internal stability of the State and of the country; strategical\r\nconditions, defining the measure of efficiency of the National Defence;\r\neconomic conditions, such as the productivity of the country's\r\nindustries and the relation of production to consumption; the\r\nconditions of labour, of transport, etc. The Government, the Front,\r\nthe villages, the factories, and the transport offered no necessary\r\nguarantees, and the Ministry of Finance could but have recourse to\r\npalliatives in order to arrest the disruption of the entire system\r\nof the currency and the complete collapse of the Budget, pending the\r\nrestoration of comparative order in the country. According to the\r\naccepted view, the main defects of our pre-War Budget were that it was\r\nbased upon the revenue of the spirit monopoly (800,000,000 roubles),\r\nand that there was scarcely any direct taxation. Before the War the\r\nBudget of Russia was about 3½ milliards of roubles; the National Debt\r\nwas about 8½ milliards, and we paid nearly 400,000,000 roubles interest\r\nper annum; half of that sum went abroad, and was partially covered by\r\n1½ milliards of our exports. The War and Prohibition completely upset\r\nour Budget. Government expenses during the War reached the following\r\nfigures:\r\n\r\n             ½ 1914     5 milliards of roubles.\r\n               1915    12     \"         \"\r\n               1916    18     \"         \"\r\n Seven months, 1917    18     \"         \"\r\n\r\nThe enormous deficit was partially covered by loans and by paper\r\ncurrency. The expenses of the War were met, however, out of the\r\nso-called \"War Fund.\" At the Stavka, in accordance with the dictates\r\nof practical wisdom, expenditure was under the full control of the\r\nChief-of-Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, who determined the\r\nheads of expenditure in his Orders, schedules, and estimates.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution dealt the death-blow to our finance. As Shingarev, the\r\nMinister of Finance, said, the Revolution \"induced everyone to claim\r\nmore rights, and stifled any sense of duty. Everybody demanded higher\r\nwages, but no one dreamt of paying taxes, and the finances of the\r\ncountry were thus placed in a hopeless position.\" There was a real\r\norgy; everyone was desperately trying to grab as much as possible from\r\nthe Treasury under the guise of democratisation, taking advantage\r\nof the impotence of the Government and of powerlessness to resist.\r\nEven Nekrassov had the courage to declare at the Moscow Congress that\r\n\"Never in history had any Czarist Government been as generous and\r\nprodigal as the Government of Revolutionary Russia,\" and that \"the\r\nnew Revolutionary régime is much more expensive than the old one.\"\r\nSuffice it to quote a few \"astronomic\" figures in order to gauge the\r\ninsuperable obstacles in the way of a reasonable Budget. The decline of\r\nproduction and the excessive rise in wages resulted in the necessity\r\nof enormous expenditure for subsidies to expiring concerns and for\r\noverpayments for means of production. These over-payments in the\r\nDonetz Basin alone amounted to 1,200,000,000 roubles; the increase in\r\nthe soldiers' pay, 500,000,000 roubles; railwaymen's pay, 350,000,000\r\nroubles; Post Office employees, 60,000,000 roubles. After a month\r\nthe latter demanded another 105,000,000 roubles, while the entire\r\nrevenue of the Posts and Telegraphs was 60,000,000 roubles. The Soviet\r\ndemanded 11 milliards (in other words, nearly the total of the Budget\r\nfor 1915) for allowances to soldiers' wives, whereas only 2 milliards\r\nhad been spent till 1917 under this head. The Food Supply Committees\r\ncost 500,000,000 roubles per annum, and the Land Committee 140,000,000\r\nroubles, etc., etc. Meanwhile the revenue was falling steadily. Thus,\r\nfor example, the Land Tax fell 32 per cent. in the first few months of\r\nthe Revolution; the revenue from town property, 41 per cent.; the House\r\nTax, 43 per cent., etc. At the same time, our internal troubles caused\r\nthe depreciation of the rouble and a fall in the price of Russian\r\nsecurities abroad. The Provisional Government based its financial\r\npolicy upon \"reorganisation of the Financial System on democratic\r\nlines and the direct taxation of the propertied classes\" (Death\r\nDuties, Excess Profits Taxes, Income Taxes, etc.). The Government,\r\nhowever, would not adopt the measure recommended by the Revolutionary\r\nDemocracy--a compulsory loan or a high Capital Levy--a measure\r\ndistinctly tainted with Bolshevism. All these just taxes, introduced or\r\nplanned, did not suffice even partially to satisfy the growing needs of\r\nthe State. In the month of August the Finance Ministry was compelled to\r\nincrease indirect taxation on certain monopolies, such as tea, sugar,\r\nand matches. These measures were, of course, extremely burdensome, and\r\ntherefore highly unpopular.\r\n\r\nExpenditure was growing, revenue was not forthcoming. The Liberty Loan\r\nwas not progressing favourably, and there could be no hope for foreign\r\nloans on account of the condition of the Russian Front. Internal loans\r\nand Treasury Bonds yielded 9½ milliards in the first half of 1917.\r\nOrdinary revenue was expected to yield 5,800,000,000 roubles. There\r\nremained one weapon established by the historical tradition of every\r\nrevolution--the Printing Press.\r\n\r\nPaper currency reached colossal proportions:\r\n\r\n ½ 1914   1,425,000,000 roubles.\r\n   1915   2,612,000,000   \"\r\n   1916   3,488,000,000   \"\r\n ½ 1917   3,990,000,000   \"\r\n\r\nAccording to the estimates of July, 1917, the total of paper currency\r\nwas 13,916,000,000 roubles (the gold reserve was 1,293,000,000\r\nroubles), as against 2 milliards before the War. Four successive\r\nFinance Ministers were unable to drag the country out of the financial\r\nmorass. This might possibly have been achieved by the awakening of the\r\nnational spirit and an understanding of the interests of the State, or\r\nby the growth of a wise and strong power which could have dealt a final\r\nblow to the anti-State, selfish motives of the Bourgeois elements that\r\nbased their well-being upon the War and upon the blood of the people,\r\nas well as of the Democracy, which, in the words of Shingarev, \"so\r\nseverely condemned through its representatives in the Duma the very\r\nsame poison (paper currency) which it was now drinking greedily at the\r\nmoment when that Democracy had become its own master.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE STRATEGICAL POSITION OF THE RUSSIAN FRONT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first and fundamental question with which I was confronted at the\r\nStavka was _the objective of our Front_. The condition of the enemy did\r\nnot appear to us as particularly brilliant. But I must confess that\r\nthe truth as at present revealed exceeds all our surmises, especially\r\naccording to the picture drawn by Hindenburg and Ludendorff of the\r\ncondition of Germany and of her Allies in 1917. I will not dwell\r\nupon the respective numerical strength, armaments, and strategical\r\npositions on the Western Front. I will only recall that in the middle\r\nof June Hindenburg gave rather a gloomy description of the condition\r\nof the country in his telegram to the Emperor. He said: \"We are very\r\nmuch perturbed by the depression of the spirits of the people. That\r\nspirit must be raised, _or we shall lose the War_. Our Allies also\r\nrequire support, lest they desert us.... Economic problems must be\r\nsolved, which are of paramount importance to our future. The question\r\narises--Is the Chancellor capable of solving them? A solution must be\r\nfound _or else we perish_.\"\r\n\r\nThe Germans were anticipating a big offensive of the British and the\r\nFrench on the Western Front, where they had concentrated their main\r\nattention and their main forces, leaving on the Eastern Front after the\r\nRussian Revolution only such numbers as were scarcely sufficient for\r\ndefence. And yet the position on the Eastern Front continued to create\r\na certain nervousness at the German G.H.Q. Will the Russian people\r\nremain steadfast, or will the Defeatist tendencies prevail? Hindenburg\r\nwrote: \"As the condition of the Russian Army prevented us from finding\r\na clear answer to that question, our position in regard to Russia\r\nremained insecure.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of all its defects, the Russian Army in March, 1917, was\r\na formidable force, with which the enemy had seriously to reckon.\r\nOwing to the mobilisation of industry, to the activities of the\r\nWar-Industries Committees, and partly to the fact that the War\r\nMinistry was showing increased energy, our armaments had reached\r\na level hitherto unknown. Also, the Allies were supplying us with\r\nartillery and war materials through Murmansk and Archangel on a\r\nlarger scale. In the spring we had the powerful Forty-Eighth Corps--a\r\nname under which heavy artillery of the highest calibre for special\r\npurposes, \"Taon,\" was concealed. In the beginning of the year the\r\nengineering troops were reorganised and amplified. At the same time new\r\ninfantry divisions were beginning to deploy. This measure, adopted by\r\nGeneral Gourko during his temporary tenure of office as Chief-of-Staff\r\nof the Supreme C.-in-C., consisted in the reduction of regiments from\r\nfour battalions to three, as well as the reduction of the number of\r\nguns to a division. A third division was thus created in every Army\r\nCorps, with artillery. There can be no doubt that, had this scheme been\r\nintroduced in peace-time, the Army Corps would have been more pliable\r\nand considerably stronger. It was a risky thing to do in war-time.\r\nBefore the spring operations the old divisions were disbanded,\r\nwhereas the new ones were in a pitiable state in regard to armaments\r\n(machine-guns, etc.), as well as technical strength and equipment. Many\r\nof them had not been sufficiently blended together--a circumstance of\r\nparticular importance in view of the Revolution. The position was so\r\nacute that in May the Stavka was compelled to sanction the disbanding\r\nof those of the Third Division which should prove feeble, and to\r\ndistribute the men among units of the line. This idea, however, was\r\nhardly ever put into practice, as it encountered strong opposition\r\non the part of units already disaffected by the Revolution. Another\r\nmeasure which weakened the ranks of the Army was the dismissal of the\r\nsenior men in the ranks.\r\n\r\nThis decision, fraught with incalculable consequences, was taken on the\r\neve of a general offensive. It was due to a statement made at a Council\r\nat the Stavka by the Minister of Agriculture (who was also in charge\r\nof supplies) that the condition of supplies was critical, and that\r\nhe could not undertake the responsibility of feeding the Army unless\r\nabout a million men were removed from the ration list. In the debate\r\nattention was drawn to the presence in the Army of an enormous number\r\nof non-combatants, quite out of proportion to the numbers of fighting\r\nmen, and to the inclusion in the Army of a quantity of auxiliary\r\nbodies, which were hardly necessary, such as of Labour Organisations,\r\nChinese, and other alien Labour Battalions, etc. Mention was also\r\nmade of the necessity of having a younger Army. I very much feared\r\nthis trend of mind, and gave orders to the Staff to draw up accurate\r\nlists of all the above-named Capitalists. While this work was still\r\nin preparation the War Minister issued, on April 5th, an Order of the\r\nDay giving leave, in the internal districts, to soldiers over forty to\r\nwork in the fields till May 15th. Leave was afterwards extended till\r\nJune 15th, but practically hardly anyone returned. On April 10th the\r\nProvisional Government discharged all men over forty-three. Under the\r\npressure of the men it became unavoidable to spread the provisions\r\nof the first Order to the Army, which would not be reconciled to any\r\nprivileges granted to the rear. The second Order gave rise to a very\r\ndangerous tendency, as it practically amounted to a _beginning of\r\ndemobilisation_. The elemental desire of those who had been given leave\r\nto return to their homes could not be controlled by any regulations,\r\nand the masses of these men, who flooded the railway stations, caused\r\na protracted disorganisation of the means of transport. Some regiments\r\nformed out of Reserve battalions lost most of their men. In the rear of\r\nthe Army transport was likewise in a state of confusion. The men did\r\nnot wait to be relieved, but left the lorries and the horses to their\r\nfate; supplies were plundered and the horses perished. The Army was\r\nweakened as a result of these circumstances, and the preparations for\r\nthe defensive were delayed.\r\n\r\n[Map: The Russian (European) Front in 1917.]\r\n\r\n[Map: The Russian Caucasian Front in March 1917.]\r\n\r\nThe Russian Army occupied an enormous Front, from the Baltic to the\r\nBlack Sea and from the Black Sea to Hamadan. Sixty-eight infantry\r\nand nine cavalry corps occupied the line. Both the importance of and\r\nthe conditions obtaining on these Fronts varied. Our Northern Front,\r\nincluding Finland, the Baltic and the line of the Western Dvina, was\r\nof great importance, as it covered the approaches to Petrograd. But\r\nthe importance at that Front was limited to defensive purposes, and\r\nfor that reason it was impossible to keep at that Front large forces\r\nor considerable numbers of guns. The conditions of that Theatre--the\r\nstrong defensive line of the Dvina--a series of natural positions in\r\nthe rear linked up with the main positions of the Western Russian\r\nFront, and the impossibility of any important operations in the\r\ndirection of Petrograd without taking possession of the Sea, which was\r\nin our hands--all this would have justified us in considering that\r\nthe Front was, to a certain extent, secure, had it not been for two\r\ncircumstances, which caused the Stavka serious concern: The troops of\r\nthe Northern Front, owing to the vicinity of Revolutionary Petrograd,\r\nwere more demoralised than any other, and the Baltic Fleet and its\r\nbases--Helsingfors and Kronstadt, of which the latter served as the\r\nmain base of Anarchism and Bolshevism--were either \"autonomous\" or in\r\na state of semi-Anarchy. While preserving to a certain degree the\r\noutward form of discipline, the Baltic Fleet was actually in a state\r\nof complete insubordination. The Admiral in command, Maximov, was\r\nentirely in the hands of the Central Committee of Sailors. Not a single\r\norder for Naval operations could be carried out without the sanction\r\nof that Committee, not to speak of Naval actions. Even the work of\r\nlaying and repairing minefields--the main defence of the Baltic--met\r\nwith opposition from Sailors' Organisations and the crews. Not only\r\nthe general decline of discipline, but the well-planned work of the\r\nGerman General Staff were quite obvious, and apprehensions were\r\nentertained lest Naval secrets and codes be revealed to the enemy. At\r\nthe same time, the troops of the Forty-Second Corps, quartered along\r\nthe Finnish Coast and on the Monzund Islands, had been idle for a\r\nlong time and their positions scattered. With the beginning of the\r\nRevolution they were, therefore, rapidly demoralised, and some of them\r\nwere nothing but physically and morally degenerate crowds. To relieve\r\nor to move them was an impossibility. I recall that in May, 1917, I\r\nmade several unavailing endeavours to send an Infantry Brigade to the\r\nMonzund Islands. Suffice it to say that the Army Corps Commander would\r\nnot make up his mind to inspect his troops and get into touch with\r\nthem--a circumstance which is typical of the troops as well as of the\r\npersonality of their Commander. In a word, the position on the Northern\r\nFront in the spring of 1917 was the following: We received daily\r\nreports of the Channel between the Islands of the Gulf of Riga and the\r\nmainland being blocked with ice, and this ice appeared to be the chief\r\nreal obstacle to an invasion of the German Fleet and Expeditionary\r\nForces.\r\n\r\nThe Western Front extended from the Disna to the Pripet. On this long\r\nline two sectors--Minsk-Vilna and Minsk-Baranovitchi--were of the\r\ngreatest importance to us, as they represented the two directions in\r\nwhich our troops, as well as the Germans, might undertake offensive\r\noperations, for which there had already been precedents. The other\r\nsections of the Front, and especially the Southern--the Pollessie,\r\nwith its forests and marshes--owing to the conditions of the country\r\nand of the railways, were passive. Along the River Pripet, its\r\ntributaries and canals, a kind of half-peaceful intercourse with the\r\nGermans had long since been established, as well as a secret exchange\r\nof goods, which was of some advantage to the \"Comrades.\" For example,\r\nwe received reports that Russian soldiers from the Line, with bags,\r\nappeared daily in the market of Pinsk, and that their advent was for\r\nmany reasons encouraged by the German authorities. There was another\r\nvulnerable point--the bridge-head on the Stokhod by the station,\r\nChrevishe-Golenin, occupied by one of the Army Corps of General Lesh.\r\nOn March 21st, after strong artillery preparation and a gas attack, the\r\nGermans fell upon our Corps and smashed it to pieces. Our troops had\r\nheavy casualties, and the remnants of the Corps retreated behind the\r\nStokhod. The Stavka did not get an accurate list of the casualties,\r\nbecause it was impossible to ascertain the numbers of killed or wounded\r\nunder the head of \"Missing.\" The German Official Communiqué gave a\r\nlist of prisoners--150 officers and about 10,000 men. Owing to the\r\nconditions in that theatre of war, this tactical success was of no\r\nstrategical importance, and could lead to no dangerous developments.\r\nNevertheless, we could not but wonder at the frankness of the\r\ncautious _Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung_, the official organ of\r\nthe German Chancellor, which wrote: \"The Communiqué of the Stavka of\r\nthe Russian Supreme Command of March 29th is mistaken in interpreting\r\nthe operations undertaken by the German troops, and dictated by a\r\ntactical necessity which had arisen only within the limits of a given\r\nsector, was an operation of general importance.\" The paper knew the\r\nfacts of which we were not certain and which have now been explained\r\nby Ludendorff. From the beginning of the Russian Revolution, Germany\r\nhad a new aim: _Unable to conduct operations on both the main Fronts,\r\nshe had decided attentively to follow and to encourage the process\r\nof demoralisation in Russia, striking at her not by arms, but by\r\ndeveloping propaganda_. The battle of the Stokhod was fought on the\r\npersonal initiative of General Linsingen, and the German Government was\r\nfrightened because it considered that \"at a moment when fraternisation\r\nwas proceeding at full speed\" German attacks might revive the dying\r\nflames of patriotism in Russia and postpone her collapse. The\r\nChancellor asked the German G.H.Q. to make as little as possible of\r\nthat success, and the G.H.Q. cancelled all further offensives \"in order\r\nnot to dash the hopes for peace which were about to be realised.\"\r\n\r\nOur reverse on the Stokhod produced a strong impression in the country.\r\nIt was the first fighting experience of the \"Freest Revolutionary\r\nArmy in the world....\" The Stavka merely gave the facts in a spirit\r\nof impartiality. In the circles of the Revolutionary Democracy the\r\nreverse was explained partly by the treachery of the Commanding\r\nOfficers and partly by a conspiracy to emphasise by this example the\r\nimpracticability of the new Army Regulations and the danger of the\r\ncollapse of discipline, partly by the incompetence of the military\r\nauthorities. The Moscow Soviet wrote to the Stavka accusing one of the\r\nassistants of the War Minister who had commanded a division on that\r\nFront of being a traitor. Others attributed our defeat solely to the\r\ndemoralisation of the troops. In reality, the reasons for the defeat\r\nwere two-fold: The _tactical_ reason--the doubtful practicability\r\nof occupying a narrow bridge-head when the river was swollen, the\r\ninsecurity of the rear and perhaps inadequate use of the troops and of\r\ntechnical means; and the _psychological_ reason, the collapse of the\r\n_moral_ and of the discipline of the troops. The last circumstance,\r\napparent in the enormous number of prisoners, gave both the Russian\r\nStavka and Hindenburg's headquarters much food for thought.\r\n\r\nThe South-Western Front, from the Pripet to Moldavia, was the most\r\nimportant, and attracted the greatest attention. From that Front,\r\noperating lines of the highest importance led to the North-West, into\r\nthe depths of Galicia and Poland, to Cracow, Warsaw and Brest-Litovsk.\r\nThe advance along these lines was covered from the South by the\r\nCarpathians, separated the Southern Austrian group of armies from the\r\nNorthern German, and threatened the rear and the communications of the\r\nlatter. These operating lines, upon which no serious obstacles were\r\nencountered, led us to the Front of the Austrian troops, whose fighting\r\ncapacity was lower than the Germans. The rear of our South-Western\r\nFront was comparatively well-organised and prosperous. The psychology\r\nof the troops, of the Command, and of the Staffs always differed\r\nconsiderably from the psychology of other Fronts. In the glorious,\r\nbut joyless, campaign only the armies of the South-Western Front had\r\nwon splendid victories, had taken hundreds of thousands of prisoners,\r\nhad made victorious progress hundreds of miles deep into the enemy\r\nterritory, and had descended into Hungary from the Carpathians. These\r\ntroops had formerly always believed in success. Brussilov, Kornilov,\r\nKaledin had made their reputations on that Front. Owing to all these\r\ncircumstances the South-Western Front was regarded as the natural base\r\nand the centre of the impending operations. Consequently, troops,\r\ntechnical means, the greater part of the heavy artillery (\"Taon\") and\r\nmunitions were concentrated at that Front. The region between the\r\nUpper Seret and the Carpathians was, therefore, being prepared for\r\nthe offensive, _Places d'armes_ erected, roads made. Further south\r\nthere was the Roumanian Front, stretching to the Black Sea. After\r\nthe unsuccessful campaign of 1916 our troops occupied the line of\r\nthe Danube, the Seret and the Carpathians, and it was sufficiently\r\nfortified. Part of General Averesco's Roumanian troops occupied\r\nthe Front between our Fourth and Ninth Armies, and part were being\r\norganised under the direction of the French General, Berthelot,\r\nassisted by Russian Gunner Instructors. The reorganisation and\r\nformation proceeded favourably, the more so as the Roumanian soldier\r\nis excellent war material. I became acquainted with the Roumanian\r\nArmy in November, 1916, when I was sent with the Eighth Army Corps to\r\nBuseo, into the thick of the retreating Roumanian Armies. Curiously\r\nenough, I was ordered to advance in the direction of Bucarest until\r\nI came into contact with the enemy, and to cover that direction with\r\nthe assistance of the retreating Roumanian troops. For several months\r\nI fought by Buseo, Rymnik and Fokshany, having two Roumanian Corps\r\nat times under my command and Averesco's Army on my flank. I thus\r\ngained a thorough knowledge of the Roumanian troops. In the beginning\r\nof the campaign the Roumanian Army showed complete disregard of the\r\nexperience of the World War. In matters of equipment and ammunition\r\ntheir levity was almost criminal. There were several capable Generals,\r\nthe officers were effeminate and inefficient, and the men were\r\nsplendid. The artillery was adequate, but the infantry was untrained.\r\nThese are the main characteristics of the Roumanian Army, which soon\r\nafterwards acquired better organisation and improved in training and\r\nequipment. The relations between the actual Russian Commander-in-Chief,\r\nwho was designated as the Assistant C.-in-C., and the King of Roumania,\r\nwho was nominally in Chief Command, were fairly cordial. Although the\r\nRussian troops began to commit excesses, which had a bad effect upon\r\nthe attitude of the Roumanians, the condition of the Front did not,\r\nhowever, cause serious apprehension. Owing to the general conditions at\r\nthe Theatre of War, only an advance in great strength in the direction\r\nof Bucarest and an invasion of Transylvania could have had a political\r\nand strategical effect. But new forces could not be moved to Roumania,\r\nand the condition of the Roumanian Railways excluded all hope of the\r\npossibility of transport and supplies on a large scale. The theatre,\r\ntherefore, was of secondary importance, and the troops of the Roumanian\r\nFront were preparing for a local operation, with a view to attracting\r\nthe Austro-German forces.\r\n\r\nThe Caucasian Front was in an exceptional position. It was far distant.\r\nFor many years the Caucasian Administration and Command had enjoyed a\r\ncertain degree of autonomy. From August, 1916, the Army was commanded\r\nby the Grand-Duke Nicholas, a man of commanding personality, who took\r\nadvantage of his position whenever there was a difference of opinion\r\nbetween himself and the Stavka. Finally, the natural conditions of\r\nthe theatre of war and the peculiarities of the enemy rendered that\r\nFront entirely different from the European. All this led to a kind\r\nof remoteness and aloofness of the Caucasian Army and too abnormal\r\nrelations with the Stavka. General Alexeiev repeatedly stated that,\r\nin spite of all his efforts, he was unable clearly to discern the\r\nsituation in the Caucasus. The Caucasus lived independently, and told\r\nthe Government only as much as it considered necessary; and the reports\r\nwere coloured in accordance with local interests.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1917 the Caucasian Army was in a difficult position,\r\nnot by reason of the strategical or fighting advantages of the\r\nenemy--the Turkish Army was by no means a serious menace--but of\r\ninternal disorganisation. The countryside was roadless and bare. There\r\nwere no supplies or forage, and the difficulties of transport made\r\nthe life of the troops very arduous. The Army Corps on the Right Flank\r\nwas comparatively well supplied, owing to facilities for transport\r\nacross the Black Sea, but the other Army Corps, and especially those\r\nof the Left Flank, fared very badly. Owing to geographical conditions,\r\nlight transport required an enormous number of horses, while there\r\nwas no fodder on the spot. Railways of all kinds were being built\r\nvery slowly, partly owing to a lack of railway material and partly\r\nbecause that material had been wasted by the Caucasian Front upon the\r\nTrapezund Railway, which was of secondary importance, owing to the\r\nparallel Maritime transport. In the beginning of May General Yudenitch\r\nreported that, owing to disease and loss of horses, transport was\r\ncompletely disorganised, batteries in position had no horses, half of\r\nthe transport was non-existent, and 75,000 horses were needed. Tracks,\r\nrolling stock and forage were urgently required. In the first half of\r\nApril 30,000 men (22 per cent.) of the Infantry of the Line had died of\r\ntyphus and scurvy. Yudenitch therefore foreshadowed the necessity of\r\na compulsory retreat to points of supply, the centre towards Erzerum\r\nand the Right Flank to the frontier. The solution suggested by General\r\nYudenitch could not be accepted, both for moral reasons and because our\r\nretreat would have freed Turkish troops for action on other Asiatic\r\nFronts. This circumstance particularly worried the British Military\r\nRepresentative at the Stavka, who repeatedly conveyed to us the\r\ndesire of the British G.H.Q. that the Left Flank of our troops should\r\nadvance in the valley of the River Diala for a combined operation\r\nwith General Maude's Mesopotamian contingent against Halil Pasha's\r\nArmy. This advance was necessary to the British rather for political\r\nconsiderations than for strategical requirements. The actual condition\r\nof our Left Flank Army Corps was, moreover, truly desperate, and in\r\nMay tropical heat set in in the valley of the Diala. As a result the\r\nCaucasian Front was unable to advance, and was ordered actively to\r\ndefend its position. The advance of the Army Corps of the Left Flank,\r\nin contact with the British, was made conditional upon the latter\r\nsupplying the troops. As a matter of fact, in the middle of April, a\r\npartial retreat took place in the direction of Ognot and Mush; at the\r\nend of April the Left Flank began its fruitless advance in the valley\r\nof the Diala, and subsequently a condition arose on the Caucasian Front\r\nwhich was something between War and Peace.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, mention must be made of another portion of the Armed\r\nForces of Russia in that theatre--the Black Sea Fleet. In May and in\r\nthe beginning of June serious disturbances had already occurred, which\r\nled to the resignation of Admiral Koltchak. The Fleet, however, was\r\nstill considered strong enough to carry out its task--to hold the Black\r\nSea and also to blockade the Turkish and Bulgarian coasts and guard the\r\nmaritime routes to the Caucasian and Roumanian Fronts.\r\n\r\nI have given a short summary of the conditions of the Russian\r\nFront without indulging in a detailed examination of strategical\r\npossibilities. Whatever our strategy during that period may have been,\r\nit was upset by the masses of the soldiery, for from Petrograd to the\r\nDanube and the Diala demoralisation was spreading and growing. In the\r\nbeginning of the Revolution it was impossible to gauge the extent of\r\nits effects upon various fronts and upon future operations. But many\r\nwere those whose minds were poisoned by a suspicion as to the futility\r\nof all our plans, calculations and efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE QUESTION OF THE ADVANCE OF THE RUSSIAN ARMY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were thus confronted with a crucial question: SHOULD THE RUSSIAN\r\nARMY ADVANCE?\r\n\r\nOn March 27th the Provisional Government issued a proclamation \"To the\r\nCitizens\" on the subject of war aims. The Stavka could not detect any\r\ndefinite instructions for governing the Russian Army in the midst of a\r\nseries of phrases in which the true meaning of the appeal was obscured\r\nin deference to the Revolutionary Democracy. \"The Defence at all costs\r\nof our national patrimony and the liberation of the country from the\r\nenemy who has invaded it is the first and vital aim of our soldiers,\r\nwho are defending the freedom of the people.... Free Russia does not\r\naim at domination over other peoples, at depriving them of _their_\r\nnational patrimony, or at the forcible seizure of foreign territories.\r\nShe aims at a lasting peace, on the basis of the self-determination\r\nof peoples. The Russian people do not wish to increase their external\r\npower at the expense of other peoples ... but ... will not allow their\r\nMother Country to come out of the great struggle downtrodden and\r\nweakened. These principles will constitute the basis of the Foreign\r\nPolicy of the Provisional Government ... _while all the obligations to\r\nour Allies will be respected_.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Note of April 18th, addressed to the Allied Powers by the\r\nForeign Minister, Miliukov, we find yet another definition: \"The\r\nuniversal desire of the people to carry the World War to a victorious\r\nconclusion ... has grown owing to the consciousness of the common\r\nresponsibility of everyone. This desire has become more active,\r\nbecause it is concentrated on the aim which is immediate and clear to\r\neveryone--_that of repelling the enemy who has invaded the territory\r\nof our Mother Country_.\" These, of course, were mere phrases, which\r\ndescribed the War aims in cautious, timorous and nebulous words,\r\nallowing of any interpretation, and deprived, moreover, any foundation\r\nin fact. The will for victory in the people and in the Army had\r\nnot only not grown, but was steadily decreasing, as a result of\r\nweariness and waning patriotism, as well as of the intense work of\r\nthe abnormal coalition between the representatives of the extreme\r\nelements of the Russian Revolutionary Democracy and the German\r\nGeneral Staff. That coalition was formed by ties which were unseen\r\nand yet quite perceptible. I will deal with that question later, and\r\nwill only say here that the destructive work, in accordance with\r\nthe Zimmerwald programme, for ending the War began long before the\r\nRevolution and was conducted from within as well as from without. The\r\nProvisional Government was trying to pacify the militant element of the\r\nRevolutionary Democracy by expounding meaningless and obscure formulas\r\nwith regard to the War aims, but it did not interfere with the Stavka\r\nin regard to the choice of strategical means. We were, therefore, to\r\ndecide the question of the advance independently from the prevailing\r\ncurrents of political opinion. The only clear and definite object upon\r\nwhich the Commanding Staffs could not fail to agree was to defeat the\r\nenemy in close union with the Allies. Otherwise our country was doomed\r\nto destruction.\r\n\r\nSuch a decision implied an advance on a large scale because victory was\r\nimpossible without it, and a devastating war might otherwise become\r\nprotracted. The responsible organs of the Democracy, the majority of\r\nwhom had Defeatist tendencies, tried correspondingly to influence\r\nthe masses. Even the moderate Socialist circles were not altogether\r\nfree from these tendencies. The masses of the soldiery utterly failed\r\nto understand the ideas behind of the Zimmerwald programme; but the\r\nprogramme itself offered a certain justification for the elementary\r\nfeelings of self-preservation. In other words, it was a question with\r\nthem of saving their skin. The idea of an advance could not, therefore,\r\nbe particularly popular with the Army, as demoralisation was growing.\r\nThere was no certainty not only that the advance would be successful,\r\nbut even that the troops would obey the order to go forward. The\r\ncolossal Russian Front was still steady ... by the force of inertia.\r\nThe enemy feared it, as, like ourselves, he was unable to gauge its\r\npotential strength. What if the advance were to disclose our impotence?\r\n\r\nSuch were the motives adduced against an advance. But there were\r\ntoo many weighty reasons in favour of it, and these reasons were\r\nimperative. The Central Powers had exhausted their strength, moral and\r\nmaterial, and their man power. If our advance in the autumn of 1916,\r\nwhich had no decisive strategical results, had placed the enemy forces\r\nin a critical position, what might not happen now, when we had become\r\nstronger and, technically better equipped, when we had the advantage\r\nin numbers, and the Allies were planning a decisive blow in the spring\r\nof 1917? The Germans were awaiting the blow with feverish anxiety,\r\nand in order to avert it they had retreated thirty miles on a front\r\nof 100 miles between Arras and Soissons to the so-called Hindenburg\r\nline, after causing incredibly ruthless and inexcusable devastation to\r\nthe relinquished territory. This retreat was significant, as it was\r\nan indication of the enemy's weakness, and gave rise to great hopes.\r\n_We had to advance._ Our intelligence service was completely destroyed\r\nby the suspicions of the Revolutionary Democracy, which had foolishly\r\nbelieved that this service was identical with the old secret police\r\norganisation, and had therefore abolished it. Many of the delegates\r\nof the Soviet were in touch with the German agents. The fronts were\r\nin close contact, and espionage was rendered very easy. In these\r\ncircumstances our decision not to advance would have been undoubtedly\r\ncommunicated to the enemy, who would have immediately commenced the\r\ntransference of his troops to the Western Front. This would have been\r\ntantamount to treason to our Allies, and would have inevitably led to a\r\nseparate peace--with all its consequences--if not officially, at least\r\npractically. The attitude of the revolutionary elements in Petrograd\r\nin this matter was, however, so unstable that the Stavka had at first\r\nsuspected--without any real foundation--the Provisional Government\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThis caused the following incident: At the end of April, in the\r\ntemporary absence of the Supreme C.-in-C., the Chief of the Diplomatic\r\nChancery reported to me that the Allied Military Attaches were\r\ngreatly perturbed because a telegram had just been received from the\r\nItalian Ambassador at Petrograd, in which he categorically stated\r\nthat the Provisional Government had decided to conclude a separate\r\npeace with the Central Powers. When the receipt of a telegram had\r\nbeen ascertained, I sent a telegram to the War Minister, because I\r\nwas then unaware of the fact that the Italian Embassy, owing to the\r\nimpulsiveness of its personnel, had more than once been the channel\r\nthrough which false rumours had been spread. My telegram was most\r\nemphatic, and ended thus: \"Posterity will stigmatise with deep contempt\r\nthe weak-kneed, impotent, irresolute generation which was good\r\nenough to destroy the rotten régime, but not good enough to preserve\r\nthe honour, the dignity, and the very existence of Russia.\" The\r\nmisunderstanding was painful indeed; the news was false, the Government\r\nwas not thinking of a separate peace. Later, at the fateful sitting of\r\nthe Conference at the Stavka of Commanders-in-Chief and members of the\r\nGovernment, on July 16th, I had an opportunity of expressing my views\r\nonce more. I said: \"... There is another way--the way of treason. It\r\nwould give a respite to our distressed country.... But the curse of\r\ntreachery will not give us happiness. At the end of that way there is\r\nslavery--political, economical, and moral.\"\r\n\r\nI am aware that in certain Russian circles such a straightforward\r\nprofession of moral principles in politics was afterwards condemned.\r\nIt was stated that such idealism is misplaced and pernicious, that\r\nthe interests of Russia must be considered above all \"conventional\r\npolitical morality.\"... A people, however, lives not for years, but for\r\ncenturies, and I am certain that, had we then altered the course of our\r\nexternal policy, the sufferings of the Russian people would not have\r\nbeen materially affected, and the gruesome, blood-stained game with\r\nmarked cards would have continued ... at the expense of the people.\r\nThe psychology of the Russian military leaders did not allow of such a\r\nchange, of such a compromise with conscience. Alexeiev and Kornilov,\r\nabandoned by all and unsupported, continued for a long time to follow\r\nthat path, trusting and relying upon the common-sense, if not the noble\r\nspirit, of the Allies and preferring to be betrayed rather than betray.\r\n\r\nWas that playing the part of a Don Quixote? It may be so. But the other\r\npolicy would have had to be conducted by other hands less clean. As\r\nregards myself, three years later, having lost all my illusions and\r\nborne the heavy blows of fortune, having knocked against the solid\r\nwall of the overt and blind egoism of the \"friendly\" powers, and\r\nbeing therefore free from all obligations towards the Allies, almost\r\non the eve of the final betrayal by these powers of the real Russia,\r\nI remained the convinced advocate of _honest policy_. Now the tables\r\nare turned. At the end of April, 1920, I had to try and convince\r\nBritish Members of Parliament that a healthy national policy cannot be\r\nfree from all moral principles, and that an obvious crime was being\r\ncommitted because no other name could be given to the abandonment of\r\nthe armed forces of the Crimea to the discontinuance of the struggle\r\nagainst Bolshevism, its introduction into the family of civilised\r\nnations, and to its indirect recognition; that this would prolong for\r\na short while the days of Bolshevism in Russia, but would open wide\r\nthe gates of Europe to Bolshevism. I am firmly convinced that the\r\nNemesis of history will not forgive THEM, as it would not have then\r\nforgiven us. The beginning of 1917 was a moment of acute peril for the\r\nCentral Powers and a decisive moment for the Entente. The question\r\nof the Russian advance greatly perturbed the Allied High Command.\r\nGeneral Barter, the Representative of Great Britain, and General Janin,\r\nthe French Representative at Russian Headquarters, often visited the\r\nSupreme C.-in-C. and myself, and made inquiries on the subject. But the\r\nstatements of the German Press, with reference to pressure from the\r\nAllies and to ultimatums to the Stavka, are incorrect. These would have\r\nsimply been useless, because Janin and Barter understood the situation,\r\nand knew that it was the condition of the Army that hindered the\r\nbeginning of the advance. They tried to hurry and to increase technical\r\nassistance, while their more impulsive compatriots--Thomas, Henderson,\r\nand Vandervelde--were making hopeless endeavours to fan the flame of\r\npatriotism by their impassioned appeals to the Representatives of the\r\nRussian Revolutionary Democracy and to the troops.\r\n\r\nThe Stavka also took into consideration the strong probability that\r\nthe Russian Army would have rapidly and finally collapsed had it\r\nbeen left in a passive condition and deprived of all impulses for\r\nactive hostilities, whereas a successful advance might lift and heal\r\nthe _moral_, if not through sheer patriotism, at least through the\r\nintoxication of a great victory. Such feelings might have counteracted\r\nall international formulas sown by the enemy on the fertile soil of\r\nthe Defeatist tendencies of the Socialistic Party. Victory would\r\nhave given external peace, and some chance of peace within. Defeat\r\nopened before the country an abyss. The risk was inevitable, and was\r\njustified by the aim of saving Russia. The Supreme Commander-in-Chief,\r\nthe Quartermaster-General, and myself fully agreed as to the necessity\r\nof an advance. And this view was shared in principle by the Senior\r\nCommanding Officers. Different views were held on various Fronts as\r\nto the degree of fighting capacity of the troops and as to their\r\npreparedness. I am thoroughly convinced that the decision itself\r\nindependently of its execution rendered the Allies a great service,\r\nbecause the forces, the means, and the attention of the enemy were kept\r\non the Russian Front, which, although it had lost its former formidable\r\npower, still remained a potential danger to the enemy. The same\r\nquestion, curiously enough, was confronting Hindenburg's Headquarters.\r\nLudendorff writes: \"The general position in April and in May precluded\r\nthe possibility of important operations on the Eastern Front.\" Later,\r\nhowever, \"... there were great discussions on the subject at G.H.Q.\r\nWould not a rapid advance on the Eastern Front with the available\r\ntroops, reinforced by a few divisions from the West, offer a better\r\nchance than mere waiting? It was a most propitious moment, as some\r\npeople said, for smashing the Russian Army, when its fighting capacity\r\nhad deteriorated.... I disagreed, in spite of the fact that our\r\nposition in the West had improved. I would not do anything that might\r\ndestroy the real chances of peace.\" Ludendorff means, of course,\r\nseparate peace. What such a peace was to be we learnt later, at\r\nBrest-Litovsk....\r\n\r\nThe Armies were given directions for a new offensive. The general idea\r\nwas to break through the enemy positions on sectors specially prepared\r\non all European fronts, to advance on a broad front in great strength\r\non the South-Western Front, in the direction from Kamenetz-Podolsk to\r\nLvov, and further to the line of the Vistula, while the striking force\r\nof our Western Front was to advance from Molodetchno to Vilna and the\r\nNiemen, throwing back northwards the German Armies of General Eichorn.\r\nThe Northern and the Roumanian Fronts were to co-operate by dealing\r\nlocal blows and attracting the forces of the enemy. The time for the\r\nadvance was not definitely fixed, and a broad margin was allowed. But\r\nthe days went by, and the troops, who had hitherto obeyed orders and\r\ncarried out the most difficult tasks without a murmur, the same troops\r\nthat had hitherto withstood the onset of the Austro-German Armies with\r\nnaked breasts, without cartridges or shells, now stood with their\r\nwill-power paralysed and their reason obscured. The offensive was still\r\nfurther delayed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Allies, who had been preparing a big operation for the\r\nspring, as they had counted upon strong reinforcements being brought\r\nup by the enemy in the event of the complete collapse of the Russian\r\nFront, began the great battle in France, as had been planned, at the\r\nend of March, and _without awaiting_ the final decision on our advance.\r\nThe Allied Headquarters, however, did not consider simultaneous action\r\nas a necessary condition of the contemplated operations, even before\r\ndisaffection had begun in the Russian Army. Owing to the natural\r\nconditions of our Front we were not expected to begin the advance\r\nbefore the month of May. Meanwhile, according to the general plan of\r\ncampaign for 1917, which had been drawn up in November, 1916, at the\r\nConference at Chantilly, General Joffre intended to begin the advance\r\nof the Anglo-French Army at the end of January and the beginning of\r\nFebruary. General Nivelle, who superseded him, altered the date to the\r\nend of March after the Conference at Calais of February 14th, 1917.\r\nThe absence of co-ordination between the Western and Eastern European\r\nFronts was bearing bitter fruit. It is difficult to tell whether the\r\nAllies would have deferred their spring offensive for two months, and\r\nwhether the advances of a combined operation with the Russian Front\r\nwould have been a compensation for the delay, which gave Germany the\r\nopportunity of reinforcing and reorganising her armies. One thing is\r\ncertain--that that lack of co-ordination gave the Germans a great\r\nrespite. Ludendorff wrote: \"I detest useless discussions, but I cannot\r\nfail to think of what would have happened had Russia advanced in April\r\nand May and had won a few minor victories. We would have been faced, as\r\nin the autumn of 1916, with a fierce struggle. Our munitions would have\r\nreached a very low ebb. After careful consideration, I fail to see how\r\nour High Command could have remained the master of the situation had\r\nthe Russians obtained in April and May even the same scant successes\r\nwhich crowned their efforts in June. In April and May of 1917, in spite\r\nof our victory (?) on the Aisne and in Champagne, it was only the\r\nRussian Revolution that saved us.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nApart from the general advance on the Austro-German Front, another\r\nquestion of considerable interest arose in April--that of an\r\n_independent operation for the conquest of Constantinople_. Inspired\r\nby young and spirited naval officers, the Foreign Minister, Miliukov,\r\nrepeatedly negotiated with Alexeiev, and tried to persuade him to\r\nundertake that operation, which he considered likely to be successful,\r\nand which would, in his opinion, confront the Revolutionary Democracy,\r\nwhich was protesting against annexations, with an accomplished fact.\r\nThe Stavka disapproved of this undertaking, as the condition of\r\nour troops would not permit of it. The landing of an Expeditionary\r\nForce--in itself a very delicate task--demanded stringent discipline,\r\npreparation, and perfect order. What is more, the Expeditionary\r\nForce, which would lose touch with the main Army, should be imbued\r\nwith a very strong sense of duty. To have the sea in the rear is a\r\ncircumstance which depresses even troops with a very strong _moral_.\r\nThese elements had already ceased to exist in the Russian Army. The\r\nMinister's requests were becoming, however, so urgent that General\r\nAlexeiev deemed it necessary to give him an object-lesson, and a small\r\nExpedition was planned to the Turkish coast of Asia Minor. As far\r\nas I can remember, Zunguldak was the objective. This insignificant\r\noperation required a detachment consisting of one Infantry Regiment,\r\none Armoured Car Division, and a small Cavalry contingent, and was\r\nto have been carried out by the troops of the Roumanian Front. After\r\na while the Headquarters of that Front had shamefacedly to report\r\nthat the detachment could not be formed because the troops declined\r\nto join the Expeditionary Force. This episode was due to a foolish\r\ninterpretation of the idea of peace without annexations, which\r\ndistorted the very principles of strategy and was also, perhaps, due\r\nto the same instinct of self-preservation. It was another ill omen for\r\nthe impending general advance. That advance was still being prepared,\r\npainfully and desperately.\r\n\r\nThe rusty, notched Russian sword was still brandished. The question\r\nwas, when would it stop and upon whose head would it fall?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Foreign military representatives at the Stavka. Standing\r\non the pathway, from left to right: Lieut.-Col. Marsengo (Italy); 2.\r\nGeneral Janin (France); 3. General Alexeiev; 4. General Barter (Great\r\nBritain); 5. General Romei Longhena (Italy).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nMILITARY REFORMS--THE GENERALS--THE DISMISSAL FROM THE HIGH COMMAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreparations for the advance continued alongside of the so-called\r\n\"Democratisation.\" These phenomena must be here recorded, as they had\r\na decisive effect upon the issue of the summer offensive and upon the\r\nfinal destinies of the Army. Military reforms began by the dismissal\r\nof vast numbers of Commanding Generals. In military circles this was\r\ndescribed, in tragic jest, as \"The slaughter of the innocents.\" It\r\nopened with the conversation between the War Minister, Gutchkov, and\r\nthe General on duty at the Stavka, Komzerovski. At the Minister's\r\nrequest the General drew up a list of the Senior Commanding Officers,\r\nwith short notes (records of service). This list, afterwards completed\r\nby various people who enjoyed Gutchkov's confidence, served as a basis\r\nfor the \"slaughter.\" In the course of a few weeks 150 Senior Officers,\r\nincluding seventy Commanders of Infantry and Cavalry Divisions, were\r\nplaced on the Retired List. In his speech to the Delegates of the\r\nFront on April 29th, 1917, Gutchkov gave the following reasons for\r\nthis measure: \"It has been our first task, after the beginning of the\r\nRevolution, to make room for talent. Among our Commanding Officers\r\nthere were many honest men; but some of them were unable to grasp the\r\nnew principles of intercourse, and in a short time more changes have\r\nbeen made in our commanding personnel than have ever been made before\r\nin any army.... I realised that there could be no mercy in this case,\r\nand I was merciless to those whom I considered incapable. Of course,\r\nI may have been wrong. There may have been dozens of mistakes, but I\r\nconsulted knowledgeable people and took decisions only when I felt that\r\nthey were in keeping with the general opinion. At any rate, we have\r\npromoted all those who have proved their capacity among the Commanding\r\nOfficers. I disregarded hierarchical considerations. There are men who\r\ncommanded regiments in the beginning of the War and are now commanding\r\narmies.... We have thus attained not only an improvement, but something\r\ndifferent and equally important. By proclaiming the watchword 'Room for\r\ntalent' we have instilled joy into the hearts, and have induced the\r\nofficers to work with impetus and inspiration....\"\r\n\r\nWhat did the Army gain by such drastic changes? Did the _cadres_ of the\r\nCommanding Officers really improve? In my opinion that object was not\r\nattained. New men appeared on the scene, owing to the newly-introduced\r\nright of selecting assistants, not without the interference of our old\r\nfriends--family ties, friendship and wire-pulling. Could the Revolution\r\ngive new birth to men or make them perfect? Was a mechanical change\r\nof personnel capable of killing a system which for many years had\r\nweakened the impulse for work and for self-improvement? It may be that\r\nsome talented individuals did come to the fore, but there were also\r\ndozens, nay, hundreds, of men whose promotion was due to accident and\r\nnot to knowledge or energy. This accidental character of appointments\r\nwas further intensified when later Kerensky abolished for the duration\r\nof the War all the existing qualifications, as well as the correlation\r\nof rank and office. The qualification of knowledge and experience\r\nwas also thereby set aside. I have before me a list of the Senior\r\nCommanding Officers of the Russian Army in the middle of May, 1917,\r\nwhen Gutchkov's \"slaughter\" had been accomplished.

It\r\nis difficult to estimate their military capacity according to their\r\nlast tenures of office, because strategy and military science in\r\n1917 had almost entirely ceased to be applied and became slavishly\r\nsubservient to the soldiery, but I know the activities of these men in\r\nregard to the struggle against democratisation--_i.e._, the disruption\r\nof the Army, and the above table indicates the three groups into which\r\nthey were divided. Subsequently, after 1918, some of these men took\r\npart in the struggle or kept aloof from it.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPPORTUNISTS.\r\n\r\n --------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+------\r\n     The       |   Approving    | Non-Resisters  |   Opponents    |\r\n  Commanding   |      of        |     to         |      of        |Total.\r\n  Personnel.   |Democratisation.|Democratisation.|Democratisation.|\r\n --------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+------\r\n In Anti-      |                |                |                |\r\n  Bolshevik    |                |                |                |\r\n  Organisations|        2       |        7       |       10       |  19\r\n With the      |                |                |                |\r\n  Bolsheviks   |        6       |       --       |        1       |   7\r\n Retired from  |                |                |                |\r\n  the struggle |        7       |        4       |        3       |  14\r\n --------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+------\r\n\r\nSuch are the results of the changes in the High Command, where men\r\nwere in the public eye and where their activities attracted the\r\ncritical attention not only of the Government, but of military and\r\nsocial circles. I think that in the lower grades things were no\r\nbetter. The question of the justice of this measure may be open to\r\ndiscussion, but, personally, I have no doubt whatsoever about its\r\nextreme impracticability. The dismissal _en masse_ of Army Chiefs\r\ndefinitely undermined the faith in the Commanding Staffs, and afforded\r\nan excuse for the arbitrariness and violence of the Committees and of\r\nthe men towards individual representatives of the Commanding Staff.\r\nConstant changes and transfers removed most officers from their\r\nunits, where they may have enjoyed respect and authority acquired\r\nby military prowess. These men were thrown into new circles strange\r\nto them, and time was needed, as well as difficult work, in the new\r\nand fundamentally changed atmosphere in order to regain that respect\r\nand authority. The formation of Third Infantry Divisions was still\r\nproceeding, and was also occasioning constant changes in the Commanding\r\nPersonnel. That chaos was bound to ensue as a result of all these\r\ncircumstances is fairly obvious. So delicate a machine as the Army was\r\nin the days of War and Revolution could only be kept going by the\r\nforce of inertia, and could not withstand new commotions. Pernicious\r\nelements, of course, should have been removed and the system of\r\nappointments altered, and the path opened for those who were worthy;\r\nbeyond that the matter ought to have been allowed to follow its natural\r\ncourse without laying too much stress upon it and without devising a\r\nnew system. Apart from the Commanding Officers who were thus removed,\r\nseveral Generals resigned of their own accord--such as Letchitzki and\r\nMistchenko--who could not be reconciled to the new régime, and many\r\nCommanders who were evicted in a Revolutionary fashion by the direct or\r\nindirect pressure of the Committee or of the soldiery. Admiral Koltchak\r\nwas one of them. Further changes were made, prompted by varying and\r\nsometimes self-contradictory views upon the Army Administration. These\r\nchanges were, therefore, very fitful, and prevented a definite type of\r\nCommanding Officer from being introduced.\r\n\r\nAlexeiev dismissed the Commander-in-Chief, Ruzsky, and the Army\r\nCommander, Radko-Dmitriev, for their weakness and opportunism. He\r\nvisited the Northern Front, and, having gained an unfavourable\r\nimpression of the activities of these Generals, he discreetly raised\r\nthe question of their being \"overworked.\" That is the interpretation\r\ngiven by the Army and Society to these dismissals.\r\n\r\nBrussilov dismissed Yudenitch for the same reasons. I dismissed an\r\nArmy Commander (Kvietsinski) because his will and authority were\r\nsubservient to the disorganising activities of the Committees who were\r\ndemocratising the Army.\r\n\r\nKerensky dismissed the Supreme Commander-in-Chief and the\r\nCommanders-in-Chief, Gourko and Dragomirov, because they were\r\nstrenuously opposed to the democratisation of the Army. He also\r\ndismissed Brussilov for the opposite motives, because Brussilov was\r\nan Opportunist, pure and simple.\r\n\r\nBrussilov dismissed the Commander of the Eighth Army, General\r\nKaledin--who later became the Ataman of the Don and was universally\r\nrespected--on the plea that he had \"lost heart\" and did not approve\r\nof democratisation. This dismissal of a General with a magnificent\r\nWar record was effected in a rude and offensive manner. He was at\r\nfirst offered the command of another Army, and then offered to retire.\r\nKaledin then wrote to me: \"My record entitles me to be treated\r\notherwise than as a stop-gap, without taking my own views into\r\nconsideration.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Vannovski, who was relieved of the command of an Army Corps\r\nby the Army Commander because he refused to acknowledge the priority\r\nof the Army Committee, was immediately appointed by the Stavka to a\r\nHigher Command and given an Army on the South-Western Front.\r\n\r\nGeneral Kornilov, who had refused the Chief Command of the troops of\r\nthe Petrograd District, \"because he considered it impossible to be\r\na witness of and a contributor to the disruption of the Army by the\r\nSoviet,\" was afterwards appointed to the Supreme Command at the Front.\r\nKerensky removed me from the office of Chief-of-Staff of the Supreme\r\nC.-in-C. because I did not share the views of the Government and openly\r\ndisapproved of its activities, but, at the same time, he allowed me to\r\nassume the high office of Commander-in-Chief of our Western Front.\r\n\r\nThings also happened of an entirely different nature. The Supreme\r\nCommander-in-Chief, General Alexeiev, made several unavailing efforts\r\nto dismiss Admiral Maximov, who had been elected to the command of the\r\nBaltic Fleet and was entirely in the hands of the mutinous Executive\r\nCommittee of the Baltic Fleet. It was necessary to remove that\r\nofficer, who had brought about so much evil, influenced, no doubt, by\r\nhis surroundings, because the Committee refused to release him, and\r\nMaximov refused all summonses to come to the Stavka on the plea that\r\nthe condition of the Fleet was critical. In the beginning of June\r\nBrussilov managed to remove him from the Fleet ... at the price of\r\nappointing him Chief of the Naval Staff of the Supreme C.-in-C. Many\r\nother examples might be quoted of incredible contrasts in principles of\r\nArmy Administration occasioned by the collision of two opposing forces\r\nand two schools of thought.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have already said that the entire Commanding Staff of Generals\r\nwas strictly loyal to the Provisional Government. General Kornilov,\r\nthe would-be \"rebel,\" addressed the following speech to a Meeting\r\nof Officers: \"The old régime has collapsed. The people are building\r\na new structure of liberty, and it is the duty of the people's Army\r\nwholeheartedly to support the new Government in its difficult, creative\r\nwork.\" The Commanding Staff may have taken some interest in questions\r\nof general policy and in the Socialistic experiments of the Coalition\r\nGovernments, but no more than was taken by all cultured Russians,\r\nand they did not consider themselves entitled or obliged to induce\r\nthe troops to participate in the solution of social problems. Their\r\nonly concern was to preserve the Army and the Foreign policy which\r\ncontributed to the victory. Such a connection between the Commanding\r\nStaff and the Government, at first \"a love match\" and later one of\r\nconvenience, prevailed until the General Offensive in June, while\r\nthere still remained a flicker of hope that the mood of the Army would\r\nchange. That hope was destroyed by events, and, after the advance,\r\nthe attitude of the Commanding Staff was somewhat shaken. I may add\r\nthat the _entire_ Senior Commanding Staff considered as inadmissible\r\nthe democratisation of the Army which the Government was enforcing.\r\nFrom the table which I have quoted it can be seen that 65 per cent. of\r\nthe Commanding Officers did not raise a sufficiently strong protest\r\nagainst the disruption of the Army. The reasons were manifold and\r\nentirely different. Some did it for tactical considerations, as they\r\nthought that the Army was poisoned and that it should be healed by such\r\ndangerous antidotes. Others were prompted by purely selfish motives.\r\nI do not speak from hearsay, but because I know the _milieu_ and the\r\nindividuals, many of whom have discussed the matter with me with\r\nperfect frankness. Cultured and experienced Generals could not frankly\r\nand scientifically advocate such \"military\" views as, for example,\r\nKlembovski's suggestion that a triumvirate should be placed at the head\r\nof the Army, consisting of the Commander-in-Chief, a Commissar, and\r\nan elected soldier; Kvietzinski's suggestion that the Army Committee\r\nshould be invested with special plenary power by the War Minister and\r\nthe Central Committee of the Soviet, which would entitle them to act in\r\nthe name of that Committee; or Viranovski's suggestion that the entire\r\nCommanding Staff should be converted into \"technical advisers\" and\r\ntheir power transferred entirely to the Commissars and the Committee.\r\n\r\nThe loyalty of the High Commanding Staff can be gauged from the\r\nfollowing fact: At the end of April General Alexeiev, despairing of\r\nthe possibility of personally preventing the Government from adopting\r\nmeasures which tended to disrupt the Army, and before issuing the\r\nfamous Proclamation of the Rights of the Soldier, wired in cipher to\r\nall the Commanders-in-Chief a draft of a strong and resolute collective\r\nappeal from the Army to the Government. This appeal pointed to the\r\nabyss into which the Army was being hurled. In the event of the draft\r\nbeing approved, it was to have been signed by all Senior ranks,\r\nincluding Divisional Commanders. The Fronts, however, for various\r\nreasons, disapproved of such means of influencing the Government.\r\nGeneral Ragosa, the temporary C.-in-C. of the Roumanian Front, who was\r\nafterwards Ukrainian War Minister under the Hetman, replied that the\r\nRussian people seemed to be ordained by the Almighty to perish, and\r\nit was therefore useless to struggle against Fate. With a sign of the\r\nCross, one should patiently await the dictates of Fate!... This was\r\nliterally the sense of his telegram.\r\n\r\nSuch was the attitude and the confusion in the higher ranks of the\r\nArmy. As regards the Commanders, who fought unremittingly against the\r\ndisruption of the Army, many of them struggled against the tide of\r\ndemocratisation, as they considered it their duty to the people. They\r\ndid this in disregard of the success or failure of their efforts, of\r\nthe blows of Fate, or of the dark future, of which some already had a\r\npremonition, and which was already approaching with disaster in its\r\ntrain. On they went, with heads erect, misunderstood, slandered and\r\nsavagely hated, as long as life and courage permitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\"DEMOCRATISATION OF THE ARMY\"--ADMINISTRATION, SERVICE AND ROUTINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to carry out the democratisation of the Army and the reform\r\nof the War Ministry in accordance with the new régime, Gutchkov\r\nestablished a Commission under the Chairmanship of the late War\r\nMinister, Polivanov, who died at Riga in 1920, where he was the expert\r\nof the Soviet Government in the Delegation for making peace with\r\nPoland. The Commission was composed of representatives of the Military\r\nCommission of the Duma and of representatives of the Soviet. There was\r\na similar Commission in the Ministry of the Navy under the Chairmanship\r\nof Savitch, a prominent member of the Duma. I know more about the\r\nwork of the First Commission, and will therefore dwell upon it. The\r\nregulations drafted by the Commission were not confirmed until they\r\nhad been approved by the Military Section of the Executive Committee\r\nof the Soviet, which enjoyed great authority and often indulged in\r\nindependent military law-making. No future historian of the Russian\r\nArmy will be able to avoid mention of the Polivanov Commission--this\r\nfatal Institution whose stamp is affixed to every one of the measures\r\nwhich destroyed the Army. With incredible cynicism, not far removed\r\nfrom treachery, this Institution, comprising many Generals and officers\r\nappointed by the War Minister, systematically and daily introduced\r\npernicious ideas and destroyed the rational foundations of military\r\nadministration. Very often drafts of regulations, which appeared to\r\nthe Government as excessively demagogic and were not sanctioned,\r\nappeared in the Press and came to the knowledge of the masses of the\r\nsoldiery. They were instilled into the Army, and subsequently caused\r\npressure to be brought to bear upon the Government by the soldiery.\r\nThe military members of the Commission seemed to be competing with\r\none another in slavish subservience to the new masters, and endorsed\r\nby their authority the destructive ideas. Men who reported to the\r\nCommittee have told me that civilians occasionally protested during the\r\ndebates and warned the Committee against going too far, but no such\r\nprotests ever came from the military members. I fail to understand\r\nthe psychology of the men, who came so rapidly and unreservedly under\r\nthe heel of the mob. The list of military members of the Commission\r\nof the month of May indicates that most of them were Staff Officers\r\nand representatives of other Departments, mostly of Petrograd\r\n(twenty-five); only nine were from the Army, and these do not seem\r\nto have been drawn from the line. Petrograd has its own psychology\r\ndifferent from that of the Army. The most important and detrimental\r\nDemocratic regulations were passed concerning the organisation of\r\nCommittees, disciplinary action, the reform of the Military Courts,\r\nand, finally, the famous \"Declaration of the Rights of the Soldier.\"\r\n\r\n_Military Chiefs were deprived of disciplinary power._ It was\r\ntransferred to Regimental and Company Disciplinary Courts, which also\r\nhad to settle \"misunderstandings\" between officers and men. There is\r\nno need to comment upon the importance of this curtailment of the\r\ndisciplinary power of the officers; it introduced complete anarchy in\r\nthe internal life of regimental units, and the officer was discredited\r\n_by the law_. The latter circumstance is of paramount importance, and\r\nthe Revolutionary Democracy took full advantage of this procedure\r\nin all its attempts at law-making. The reform of the Courts aimed\r\nat weakening the influence of military judges by appointment upon\r\nthe course of the trial, the introduction of juries and the general\r\nweakening of military justice. Field Courts-Martial were abolished,\r\nwhich meted out quick punishment on the spot for obvious and heavy\r\ncrimes, such as treason, desertion, etc.\r\n\r\nThe democratisation of the Military Courts might be excused to a\r\ncertain extent by the fact that confidence in the officers, having\r\nbeen undermined, it was necessary to create judicial Courts of a\r\nmixed composition on an elective basis, which in theory were supposed\r\nto enjoy to a greater extent the confidence of the Revolutionary\r\nDemocracy. But that object was not attained, because the Military\r\nCourts--one of the foundations of order in the Army--fell entirely\r\ninto the hands of the mob. The investigating organs were completely\r\ndestroyed by the Revolutionary Democracy, and investigation was\r\nstrongly resisted by the armed men and sometimes by the Regimental\r\nRevolutionary Institutions. The armed mob, which included many\r\ncriminal elements, exercised unrestrained and ignorant pressure upon\r\nthe conscience of the judges, and passed sentences in advance of\r\nthe verdicts of the judges. Army Corps Tribunals were destroyed, and\r\nmembers of the jury who had dared to pass a sentence distasteful\r\nto the mob were put to flight. These were common occurrences. The\r\ncase was heard in Kiev of the well-known Bolshevik, Dzevaltovski, a\r\ncaptain of the Grenadier Regiment of the Guards, who was accused, with\r\nseventy-eight other men, of having refused to join in the advance\r\nand of having dragged his regiment and other units to the rear. The\r\ncircumstances of the trial were these: In Court there was a mob of\r\narmed soldiers, who shouted approval of the accused on his way from the\r\nprison to the Court. Dzevaltovski called, together with his escort,\r\nat the Local Soviet, where he received an ovation. Finally, while the\r\njury were deliberating, the Armed Reserve Battalions paraded before the\r\nCourt with the band and sang the \"International.\" Dzevaltovski and all\r\nhis companions were, of course, found \"Not guilty.\" Military Courts\r\nwere thus gradually abolished.\r\n\r\nIt would be a mistake, however, to ascribe this new tendency solely to\r\nthe influence of the Soviets. It may also be explained by Kerensky's\r\npoint of view. He said: \"I think that no results can be achieved by\r\nviolence and by mechanical compulsion in the present conditions of\r\nwarfare, where huge masses are concerned. The Provisional Government in\r\nthe three months of its existence has come to the conclusion that it is\r\nnecessary to appeal to the common-sense, the conscience and the sense\r\nof duty of the citizens, and that it is the only means of achieving the\r\ndesired results.\"\r\n\r\nIn the first days of the Revolution the Provisional Government\r\nabolished Capital Punishment by the Ukase of March 12th. The Liberal\r\nPress greeted this measure with great pathos. Articles were written\r\nexpressing strongly humanitarian views, but scant understanding of\r\nrealities, of the life of the Army, and also scant foresight. V.\r\nNabokoff, the Russian Abolitionist, who was General Secretary to the\r\nProvisional Government, wrote: \"This happy event is a sign of true\r\nmagnanimity and of wise foresight.... Capital Punishment is abolished\r\nunconditionally and for ever.... It is certain that in no other country\r\nhas the moral condemnation of this, the worst kind of murder, reached\r\nsuch enormous proportions as in Russia.... Russia has joined the States\r\nthat no longer know the shame and degradation of judicial murder.\"\r\nIt is interesting to note that the Ministry of Justice drafted two\r\nlaws, in one of which Capital Punishment was maintained for the most\r\nserious military offences--espionage and treason. But the Department of\r\nMilitary Justice, headed by General Anushkin, emphatically declared in\r\nfavour of complete abolition of Capital Punishment.\r\n\r\nJuly came. Russia had already become used to Anarchist outbreaks, but\r\nwas nevertheless horror-stricken at the events that took place on the\r\nbattlefields of Galicia, near Kalush and Tarnopol. The telegrams of the\r\nGovernment Commissars, Savinkov and Filonenko, and of General Kornilov,\r\nwho demanded the immediate reintroduction of Capital Punishment, were\r\nas a stroke of a whip to the \"Revolutionary Conscience.\" On July\r\n11th, Kornilov wrote: \"The Army of maddened, ignorant men, who are\r\nnot protected by the Government from systematic demoralisation and\r\ndisruption, and who have lost all sense of human dignity, is in full\r\nflight. On the fields, which can no longer be called battlefields,\r\nshame and horror such as the Russian Army has never known reign\r\nsupreme.... The mild Government measures have destroyed discipline,\r\nand are provoking the fitful cruelty of the unrestrained masses. These\r\nelemental feelings find expression in violence, plunder and murders....\r\nCapital Punishment would save many innocent lives at the price of a few\r\ntraitors and cowards being eliminated.\"\r\n\r\nOn July 12th the Government restored Capital Punishment and\r\nRevolutionary Military Tribunals, which replaced the former Field\r\nCourts-Martial. The difference was that the judges were elected (three\r\nofficers and three men) from the list of the juries or from Regimental\r\nCommittees. This measure, the restoration of Capital Punishment, due\r\nto pressure having been brought to bear upon the Government by the\r\nMilitary Command, the Commissars, and the Committees, was, however,\r\nforedoomed to failure. Kerensky subsequently tried to apologise to\r\nthe Democracy at the \"Democratic Conference\": \"Wait till I have\r\nsigned a single death sentence, and I will then allow you to curse\r\nme....\" On the other hand, the very personnel of the Courts and their\r\nsurroundings, described above, made the very creation of these Courts\r\nimpossible: there were hardly any judges capable of passing a death\r\nsentence or any Commissars willing to endorse such a sentence. On the\r\nFronts which I commanded there were, at any rate, no such cases. After\r\nthe new Revolutionary Military Tribunals had been functioning for two\r\nmonths, the Department of Military Justice was flooded with reports\r\nfrom Military Chiefs and Commissars on the \"blatant infringements of\r\njudicial procedure, upon the ignorance and lack of experience of the\r\njudges.\"\r\n\r\nThe disbandment of mutinous regiments was one of the punitive measures\r\ncarried out by the Supreme Administration or Command. This measure\r\nhad not been carefully thought out, and led to thoroughly unexpected\r\nconsequences--it provoked mutinies, prompted by a desire to be\r\ndisbanded. Regimental honour and other moral impulses had long since\r\nbeen characterised as ridiculous prejudices. The actual advantages of\r\ndisbanding, on the other hand, were obvious to the men: regiments were\r\nremoved from the firing line for a long time, disbanding continued for\r\nmonths, and the men were sent to new units, which were thus filled\r\nwith vagabond and criminal elements. Responsibility for this measure\r\ncan be equally divided between the War Ministry, the Commissars,\r\nand the Stavka. The whole burden of it finally fell once more upon\r\nthe guiltless officers, who lost their regiments--which were their\r\nfamilies--and their appointments, and were compelled to wander about in\r\nnew places or find themselves in the desolate condition of the Reserve.\r\n\r\nApart from this undesirable element, units were filled with the late\r\ninmates of convict prisons, owing to the broad amnesty granted by the\r\nGovernment to criminals, who were to expiate their crimes by military\r\nservice. My efforts to combat this measure were unavailing, and\r\nresulted in the formation of a special regiment of convicts--a present\r\nfrom Moscow--and in the formation of solid anarchist cadres in the\r\nReserve Battalions. The _naïf_ and insincere argument of the Legislator\r\nthat crimes were committed because of the Czarist Régime, and that\r\na free country would convert the criminal into a self-sacrificing\r\nhero, did not come true. In the garrisons, where amnestied criminals\r\nwere for some reason or other more numerous, they became a menace to\r\nthe population before they ever saw the Front. Thus, in June, in the\r\nunits quartered at Tomsk, there was an intense propaganda of wholesale\r\nplunder and of the suppression of all authority. Soldiers formed large\r\nrobber bands and terrorized the population. The Commissar, the Chief\r\nof the garrison, and all the local Revolutionary Organisations started\r\na campaign against the plunderers; after much fighting, no less than\r\n2,300 amnestied criminals were turned out of the garrison.\r\n\r\nReforms were intended to affect the entire administration of the Army\r\nand of the Fleet, but the above-mentioned Committees of Polivanov\r\nand Savitch failed to carry them out, as they were abolished by\r\nKerensky, who recognised at last all the evil they had wrought. The\r\nCommittees merely prepared the Democratisation of the War and Naval\r\nCouncils by introducing elected soldiers into them. This circumstance\r\nis the more curious because, according to the Legislator's intention,\r\nthese Councils were to consist of men of experience and knowledge,\r\ncapable of solving questions of organisation, service, and routine,\r\nof military and naval legislation, and of making financial estimates\r\nof the cost of the armed forces of Russia. This yearning of the\r\nuncultured portion of Democracy for spheres of activity foreign to it\r\nwas subsequently developed on an extensive scale. Thus, for example,\r\nmany military colleges were, to a certain extent, managed by Committees\r\nof servants, most of whom were illiterate. Under the Bolshevik Régime,\r\nUniversity Councils numbered not only Professors and students, but also\r\nhall-porters.\r\n\r\nI will not dwell upon the minor activities of the Committees, the\r\nreorganisation of the Army, and the new regulations, but will describe\r\nthe most important measure--the Committees and the \"Declaration of the\r\nRights of the Soldier.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE DECLARATION OF THE RIGHTS OF THE SOLDIER AND COMMITTEES.\r\n\r\n\r\nElective bodies from the Military Section of the Soviet to Committees\r\nand Soviets of various denominations in regimental units and in\r\nthe Departments of the Army, the Fleet and the rear, were the most\r\nprominent factor of \"Democratisation.\" These institutions were partly\r\nof a mixed type, and included both officers and men and partly soldiers\r\nand workers' institutions pure and simple. Committees and Soviets were\r\nformed everywhere as the common feature of Revolutionary Organisations,\r\nplanned before the Revolution and sanctioned by the Order No. 1.\r\nElections from the troops to the Soviet in Petrograd were fixed for\r\nFebruary 27th, and the first Army Committees came into being on March\r\n1st, in consequence of the above-mentioned Order No. 1. Towards the\r\nmonth of April self-appointed Soviets and Committees, varying in\r\ndenomination, personnel and ability, existed in the Army and in the\r\nrear, and introduced incredible confusion into the system of military\r\nhierarchy and administration. In the first month of the Revolution the\r\nGovernment and the military authorities did not endeavour to put an\r\nend to or to restrict this dangerous phenomenon. They did not at first\r\nrealise its possible consequences, and counted upon the moderating\r\ninfluence of the Officer element. They occasionally took advantage of\r\nthe Committees for counteracting acute manifestations of discontent\r\namong the soldiers, as a doctor applies small doses of poison to a\r\ndiseased organism. The attitude of the Government and of the military\r\nauthorities towards these organisations was irresolute, but was one of\r\nsemi-recognition. On April 9th, addressing the Army Delegates, Gutchkov\r\nsaid at Yassy: \"A Congress will soon be held of the Delegates of all\r\nArmy Organisations, and general regulations will then be drawn up.\r\nMeanwhile, you should _organise as best you can_, taking advantage of\r\nthe existing organisations and working for general unity.\"\r\n\r\nIn April the position became so complicated that the authorities could\r\nno longer shirk the solution of the question of Committees. At the end\r\nof March there was a Conference at the Stavka, attended by the Supreme\r\nCommander-in-Chief, the War Minister, Gutchkov, his Assistants, and\r\nofficers of the General Staff. I was also present in my capacity as\r\nfuture Chief-of-Staff to the Supreme C.-in-C. A draft was presented to\r\nthe Conference, brought from Sevastopol by the Staff-Colonel Verkhovski\r\n(afterwards War Minister). The draft was modelled upon the regulations\r\nalready in force in the Black Sea Fleet. The discussion amounted to the\r\nexpression of two extreme views--mine and those of Colonel Verkhovski.\r\nThe latter had already commenced those slightly demagogic activities\r\nby which he had at first gained the sympathies of the soldiers and\r\nof the sailors. He had had a short experience in organising these\r\nmasses. He was persuasive because he used many illustrations--I do\r\nnot know whether the facts he mentioned were real or imaginary--his\r\nviews were pliable, and his eloquence was imposing. He idealised the\r\nCommittees, and argued that they were very useful, even necessary and\r\nstatesmanlike, inasmuch as they were capable of bringing order into the\r\nchaotic movements of the soldiery. He emphatically insisted upon the\r\ncompetence and the rights of these Committees being broadened.\r\n\r\nI argued that the introduction of Committees was a measure which\r\nthe Army organisation would be unable to understand, and that it\r\namounted to disruption of the Army. If the Government was unable to\r\ncope with the movement, it should endeavour to paralyse its dangerous\r\nconsequences. With that end in view, I advocated that the activities of\r\nthe Committees should be limited to matters of internal organisation\r\n(food supplies, distribution of equipment, etc.), that the officer\r\nelement should be strengthened, and that the Committees should remain\r\nwithin the sphere of the lower grades of the Army, in order to prevent\r\nthem from spreading and acquiring a preponderating influence upon\r\nlarger formations such as Divisions, Armies, and Fronts. Unfortunately,\r\nI only succeeded in compelling the Conference to accept my views to an\r\ninsignificant degree, and on March 30th the Supreme C.-in-C. issued\r\nan Order of the Day on the \"transition to the new forms of life,\" and\r\nappealing to the officers, men, and sailors wholeheartedly to unite in\r\nthe work of introducing strict order and solid discipline within the\r\nunits of the Army and Navy.\r\n\r\nThe main principles of the regulations were the following:\r\n\r\n    (1) The _fundamental objects_ of the organisation were (_a_) to\r\n    increase the fighting power of the Army and of the Navy in order\r\n    to win the War; (_b_) to devise new rules for the life of the\r\n    soldier-citizen of Free Russia; and (_c_) to contribute to the\r\n    education of the Army and of the Fleet.\r\n\r\n    (2) The _structure_ of the organisation: Permanent\r\n    sections--Company, Regimental, Divisional, and Army Committees.\r\n    Temporary sections--Conferences, attached to the Stavka, of Army\r\n    Corps, of the Fronts, and of the Centre. The latter to form\r\n    permanent Soviet.\r\n\r\n    (3) The Conferences to be called by the respective Commanding\r\n    Officers or on the initiative of the Army Committees. All the\r\n    resolutions of the Conferences and Committees to be confirmed by\r\n    the respective military authorities prior to publication.\r\n\r\n    (4) The _competence_ of the Committees was limited to enforcing\r\n    order and fighting power (discipline, resistance to desertion,\r\n    etc.), routine (leave, barrack life, etc.), internal organisation\r\n    (control of food supplies and equipment), and education.\r\n\r\n    (5) _Questions of training_ were unreservedly excluded from\r\n    discussion.\r\n\r\n    (6) The _personnel of the Committees_ was determined in proportion\r\n    to elected representatives--one officer to two men.\r\n\r\nIn order to give an idea of the slackening of discipline in the\r\nhigher ranks I may mention that, immediately after receiving these\r\nregulations, and obviously under the influence of Army organisations,\r\nGeneral Brussilov issued the following order: \"Officers to be excluded\r\nfrom Company Committees, and in higher Committees the proportion\r\nlowered from one-third to one-sixth....\"\r\n\r\nIn less than a fortnight, however, the War Ministry, in disregard\r\nof the Stavka, published its own regulations, drafted by the famous\r\nPolivanov Committee, with the assistance of Soviet representatives. In\r\nthese new regulations substantial alterations were made: the percentage\r\nof officers in Committees was reduced; Divisional Committees abolished;\r\n\"the taking of rightful measures against abuses by Commanding Officers\r\nin the respective units\" were added to the powers of the Committees;\r\nthe Company Committees were not permitted to discuss the matter of\r\nmilitary preparedness and other purely military matters affecting\r\nthe unit, but no such reservation was made with regard to Regimental\r\nCommittees; the Regimental Commanding Officer was entitled to appeal\r\nagainst but not to suspend the decisions of the Committee; finally, the\r\nCommittees were given the task of negotiating with political parties\r\nof every description in the matter of sending delegates, speakers, and\r\npamphlets explaining the political programme before the elections to\r\nthe Constituent Assembly.\r\n\r\nThese regulations, which were tantamount to converting the Army in\r\nwar-time into an arena of political strife and depriving the Commanding\r\nOfficer of all control over his unit, constituted, in fact, one of the\r\nmain turning points on the path of destruction of the Army.\r\n\r\nThe following appreciation of these regulations by the Anarchist,\r\nMakhno (the Order of the Day of one of his subordinate Commanders of\r\nNovember 10th, 1919), is worthy of note: \"As any party propaganda at\r\nthe present moment strongly handicaps the purely military activities\r\nof the rebel armies, I emphatically declare to the population that all\r\nparty propaganda is strictly prohibited pending the complete victory\r\nover the White Armies....\"\r\n\r\nSeveral days later, in view of a protest from the Stavka, the\r\nWar Ministry issued orders for the immediate suspension of the\r\nregulations concerning the Committees. Where the Committees had\r\nalready been formed, they were allowed to carry on in order to avoid\r\nmisunderstandings. The Ministry decided to alter the section of the\r\nregulations concerning the Committees, in accordance with the orders of\r\nthe Supreme Commander-in-Chief, in which fuller consideration was given\r\nto the interests of the troops. Thus, in the middle of April there was\r\nan infinite variety in the organisation of the Army. Some institutions\r\nwere illegal, others were sanctioned by the Stavka, and others still by\r\nthe War Ministry. All these contradictions, changes, and re-elections\r\nmight have led to ridiculous confusion had not the Committees\r\nsimplified matters: they simply cast off all restrictions and acted\r\narbitrarily. Wherever troops or Army departments were quartered\r\namong the population local Soldiers' Soviets or Soviets of Soldiers\r\nand Workmen were formed, which recognised no regulations, and were\r\nparticularly intent upon covering deserters and mercilessly exploiting\r\nmunicipalities, Zemstvos, and the population. The authorities never\r\nopposed them, and it was only at the end of August that the War\r\nMinistry lost patience with the abuses of these \"Institutions of the\r\nRear,\" and informed the Press that it _intended_ to undertake the\r\ndrafting of special regulations concerning these Institutions.\r\n\r\nWho were the members of the Committees? The combatant element, living\r\nfor and understanding the interests of the Army and imbued with its\r\ntraditions, was scantily represented. Valour, courage and a sense of\r\nduty were rated very low on the market of Soldiers' Meetings. The\r\nmasses of the soldiery, who were, alas! ignorant, illiterate, and\r\nalready demoralised and distrusted their Chiefs, elected mostly men\r\nwho imposed on them by smooth talking, purely external political\r\nknowledge derived from the revelation of Party propaganda; chiefly,\r\nhowever, by shamelessly bowing to the instincts of the men. How could\r\na real soldier, appealing to the sense of duty, to obedience and to\r\na struggle for the Mother Country, compete with such demagogues? The\r\nofficers did not enjoy the confidence, they did not wish to work in\r\nthe Committees, and their political education was probably inadequate.\r\nIn the Higher Committees one met honest and sensible soldiers more\r\noften than officers, because a man wearing a soldier's tunic was in\r\na position to address the mob in a manner in which the officer could\r\nnever dare to indulge. The Russian Army was henceforward administered\r\nby Committees formed of elements foreign to the Army and representing\r\nrather Socialist Party organs. It was strange and insulting to the Army\r\nthat Congresses of the Front, representing several million combatants\r\nand many magnificent units with a long and glorious record, and\r\ncomprising officers and men of whom any Army might be proud, were held\r\nunder the Chairmanship of such men as civilian Jews and Georgians, who\r\nwere Bolsheviks, Mensheviks, or Social Revolutionaries--Posner on the\r\nWestern Front, Gegetchkory on the Caucasian, and Doctor Lordkipanitze\r\non the Roumanian.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat, then, were these Army Organisations doing that were supposed to\r\nreconstruct \"the freest Army in the world\"? I will quote a list of\r\nquestions discussed at Conferences of the Front and which influenced\r\nthe Front and Army Committees:\r\n\r\n    (1) The attitude towards the Government, the Soviet and the\r\n    Constituent Assembly.\r\n\r\n    (2) The attitude towards War and Peace.\r\n\r\n    (3) The question of a Democratic Republic as a desirable form of\r\n    Government.\r\n\r\n    (4) The question of the land.\r\n\r\n    (5) The Labour question.\r\n\r\nThese intricate and burning political and social questions, to which\r\na radical solution was being given and which created partisanship\r\nand class strife, were thus introduced into the Army that was facing\r\na strong and cruel enemy. The effect was self-evident. But even\r\nin strictly military matters certain utterances were made at the\r\nConference at Minsk, which attracted the particular attention of the\r\nmilitary and civil authorities, and caused us gravely to ponder. It was\r\nsuggested that the rank of officer, individual disciplinary power,\r\netc., should be abolished, and that the Committees should be entitled\r\nto remove Commanding Officers of whom they disapproved. From the very\r\nfirst days of their existence the Committees fought stubbornly to\r\nobtain full power not only with regard to the administration of the\r\nArmy, but even for the formula: \"All Power to the Soviets.\" At first,\r\nhowever, the attitude of the Army Committees towards the Provisional\r\nGovernment was perfectly loyal, and the lower the Committee the\r\nmore loyal it was. The Petrograd papers of March 17th were full of\r\nresolutions proclaiming unrestricted obedience to the Provisional\r\nGovernment, of telegrams greeting and of records of delegations sent\r\nby the troops, who were perturbed by rumours of the opposition of the\r\nSoviet. This attitude later underwent several changes, due to the\r\npropaganda of the Soviet. A powerful influence was exercised by the\r\nresolution of the Congress of Soviets, which I have already quoted,\r\nand which appealed to the Russian Revolutionary Democracy to organise\r\nunder the guidance of the Soviets and to be prepared to resist all the\r\nattempts of the Government to avoid the control of the Democracy or the\r\nfulfilment of their pledges.\r\n\r\nThe Higher Committees indulged chiefly in political activities and\r\nin the strengthening of Revolutionary tendencies in the Army, while\r\nthe Lower Committees gradually became absorbed in matters of service\r\nand routine, and were weakening and discrediting the authority of the\r\nCommanding Officers. The right to remove these officers was practically\r\nestablished, because the position of those who had received a vote of\r\ncensure became intolerable. Thus, for instance, on the Western Front,\r\nwhich I commanded, about sixty Senior Officers resigned--from Army\r\nCorps to Regimental Commanders. What was, however, infinitely more\r\ntragic was the endeavour of the Committees, on their own initiative and\r\nunder pressure from the troops, to interfere with purely military and\r\ntechnical Orders, thus rendering military operations difficult or even\r\nimpossible. The Commanding Officer who was discredited, fettered and\r\ndeprived of power, and, therefore, of responsibility, could no longer\r\nconfidently lead the troops into the field of victory and death.... As\r\nthere was no authority the Commanding Officers were compelled to have\r\nrecourse to the Committees, which sometimes did exercise a restraining\r\ninfluence over the licentious soldiery, resisted desertion, smoothed\r\nfriction between officers and men, appealed to the latter's sense\r\nof duty--in a word, tried to arrest the collapse of the crumbling\r\nstructure. These activities of some of the Committees still misled\r\ntheir apologists, including Kerensky. It is no use to argue with men\r\nwho think that a structure may be erected by one laying bricks one day\r\nand pulling them to pieces on the next.\r\n\r\nThe work, overt and unseen, of Army Committees, alternating between\r\npatriotic appeals and internationalist watchwords, between giving\r\nassistance to Commanding Officers and dismissing them, between\r\nexpressions of confidence in, or of distrust of, the Provisional\r\nGovernment, and ultimatums for new boots or travelling allowances\r\nfor members of Committees.... The historian of the Russian Army, in\r\nstudying these phenomena, will be amazed at the ignorance of the\r\nelementary rules governing the very existence of an armed force,\r\nwhich was displayed by the Committees in their decisions and in their\r\nwritings.\r\n\r\nThe Committees of the Rear and of the Fleet were imbued with a\r\nparticularly demagogic spirit. The Baltic Fleet was in a state\r\napproaching anarchy all the time; the Black Sea Fleet was in a better\r\ncondition, and held out until June. It is difficult to estimate the\r\nmischief made by these Committees and Soviets in the Rear, scattered\r\nall over the country. Their overbearing manner was only comparable\r\nwith their ignorance. I will mention a few examples illustrating these\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\nThe Regional Committee of the Army, the Fleet and the Workmen of\r\nFinland issued a declaration in May, in which, not content with the\r\nautonomy granted to Finland by the Provisional Government, they\r\ndemanded her complete independence, and declared that \"they would give\r\nevery support to all the Revolutionary Organisations working for a\r\nspeedy solution of that question.\"\r\n\r\nThe Central Committee of the Baltic Fleet, in conjunction with the\r\nabove-mentioned Committee, made a declaration, which coincided with the\r\nBolshevik outbreak in Petrograd in the beginning of June. They demanded\r\n\"all power to the Soviets. We shall unite in the Revolutionary struggle\r\nof our working Democracy for power, and will not allow the ships to be\r\ncalled out by the Provisional Government for the suppression of the\r\nmutiny to leave Petrograd.\"\r\n\r\nThe Committee of the Minsk Military District, shortly before the\r\nadvance, gave leave to all the Reservists to proceed to their farms.\r\nI gave orders for the trial of the Committee, but the order was of no\r\navail, because, in spite of all my representations, the War Ministry\r\nhad not established any legal responsibility for the Committees, whose\r\ndecisions were recorded by vote and occasionally by secret ballot. I\r\nwill mention yet another curious episode. The Committee of one of the\r\nCavalry Depôts on my Front decided that horses should be watered only\r\nonce a day, so most of the horses were lost.\r\n\r\nIt would be unjust to deny that the organisations of the Rear\r\noccasionally did adopt reasonable measures, but these instances are\r\nfew indeed, and they were drowned in the general wave of anarchy\r\nwhich these organisations had raised. The attitude of the Committees\r\ntowards the War, and in particular towards the proposed advance, was,\r\nof course, a momentous matter. In Chapter X. I have already described\r\nthe self-contradictions of the Soviets and Congresses, as well as\r\nthe ambiguous and insincere directions which they gave to the Army\r\nOrganisations, and which amounted to the acceptance of War and of the\r\nadvance, but without victory. The same ambiguity prevailed in the\r\nHigh Committees, with the exception, however, of the Committee of our\r\nWestern Front, which passed in June a truly Bolshevik Resolution to the\r\neffect that War has been engendered by the plundering policy of the\r\nGovernment; that the only means of ending the War was for the united\r\nDemocracies of all countries to resist their Governments; and that a\r\ndecisive victory of one or the other of the contending groups of Powers\r\nwould only tend to increase militarism at the expense of Democracy.\r\n\r\nAs long as the Front was quiet the troops accepted all these discourses\r\nand Resolutions in a spirit of comparative indifference. But when\r\nthe time came for the advance, many people thought of saving their\r\nskins, and the ready formulas of Defeatism proved opportune. Besides\r\nthe Committees, who were continuing to pass patriotic Resolutions,\r\ncertain organisations reflecting the views of the units of the Army, or\r\ntheir own, violently opposed the idea of an advance. Entire regiments,\r\ndivisions, and even Army Corps, especially on the Northern and Western\r\nRussian Fronts, refused to conduct preparatory work or to advance to\r\nthe firing line. On the eve of the advance we had to send large forces\r\nfor the suppression of units that had treacherously forgotten their\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned the attitude of many Senior Commanders towards\r\nthe Committees. The best summary of these views can be found in the\r\nappeal of General Fedotov, in temporary command of an Army, to the\r\nArmy Committee: \"Our Army is at present organised as no other Army in\r\nthe world.... Elected bodies play an important part. We--_the former\r\nleaders_--can only give the Army our military knowledge of strategy\r\nand tactics. You--the Committees--are called upon to organise the Army\r\nand to create its internal strength. Great indeed is the part which\r\nyou--the Committees--are called upon to play in the creation of a\r\nnew and strong Army. History will recognise this....\"\r\n\r\nBefore the Army Organisations were sanctioned the Commander of the\r\nCaucasian Front issued an Order for the decisions of the self-appointed\r\nTiflis Soldiers' Soviet to be published in the Orders of the Day, and\r\nfor all regulations appertaining to the Organisation and routine of the\r\nArmy to be sanctioned by that Soviet. Is one to wonder that such an\r\nattitude of a certain portion of the Commanding Staffs gave an excuse\r\nand a foundation for the growing demands of the Committees?\r\n\r\nAs regards the Western and South-Western Fronts, which I commanded,\r\nI definitely refused to have anything to do with the Committees,\r\nand suppressed, whenever possible, such of their activities as were\r\ncontrary to the interests of the Army. One of the prominent Commissars,\r\na late member of the Executive Committee of the Soviet, Stankevitch,\r\nwrote: \"Theoretically, it became increasingly apparent that either the\r\nArmy must be abolished or else the Committees. In practice, one could\r\ndo neither one nor the other. The Committees were a vivid expression\r\nof the incurable sociological disease of the Army, and a sign of its\r\ncertain collapse and paralysis. Was it not for the War Ministry to\r\nhasten the death by a resolute and hopeless surgical operation?\"\r\n\r\nThe once great Russian Army of the first period of the Revolution\r\ndwindled inevitably to nothing under such conditions as these:\r\n\r\nThere was no Mother Country. The leader had been crucified. In his\r\nstead a group appeared at the Front of five Defensists and three\r\nBolsheviks, and made an appeal to the Army:\r\n\r\n\"Forward, to battle for liberty and for the Revolution, but ... without\r\ninflicting a decisive defeat upon the enemy,\" cried the former.\r\n\r\n\"Down with the War and all power to the Proletariat!\" shouted the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe Army listened and listened, but would not move. And then ... it\r\ndispersed!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Conference of Commanders-in-Chief.

The idea was derived\r\nfrom the history of the French Revolutionary Wars, and was fostered\r\nin various circles at different times; it was prompted chiefly by\r\n_distrust of the Commanding Staffs_. Pressure was brought to bear\r\nfrom below. The Conference of the Delegates of the Front addressed an\r\nemphatic demand to the Soviet in the middle of April that Commissars\r\nshould be introduced in the Army. The excuse was that it was no longer\r\npossible to preserve order in respect of the attitude of the men\r\ntowards individual Commanding Officers, and that, if cases of arbitrary\r\ndismissal had as yet been avoided, it was only due to the fact that\r\nthe Army expected the Soviet and the Government to take the necessary\r\nsteps and did not wish to handicap their work. At the same time, the\r\nConference suggested the absurd idea of the simultaneous appointment\r\nto the Army of three kinds of Commissars: (1) from the Provisional\r\nGovernment, (2) from the Soviets, and (3) from the Army Committees.\r\nThe Conference went very far in their demands, and demanded that the\r\nCommissariats, as controlling organs, should: discuss _all_ matters\r\nappertaining to the competence of the Commanders of Armies and Fronts;\r\ncounter-sign _all_ Army Orders; investigate the activities of the\r\nCommanding Staffs, with the right to recommend their dismissal.\r\n\r\nProtracted negotiations on this matter ensued between the Soviet and\r\nthe Government, and at the end of April it was agreed that Commissars\r\nwould be appointed to the Army--one from the Provisional Government and\r\none from the Soviet. This decision, however, was subsequently altered,\r\nprobably as the result of the formation of a Coalition Ministry (May\r\n5th). One Commissar was appointed by agreement between the Government\r\nand the Soviet. He represented both these bodies, and was responsible\r\nto them. At the end of June the Provisional Government introduced the\r\noffice of Commissar of the Fronts, and thus defined their function:\r\naccording to the instructions of the War Ministry, they were to see\r\nthat all political questions arising within the Armies of the Front\r\nshould be given a uniform solution, and that the work of the Army\r\nCommissars should be co-ordinated. At the end of July a final touch\r\nwas given by the appointment of a High Commissar attached to the\r\nStavka, and the entire official correspondence was concentrated in the\r\npolitical section of the War Ministry. No law, however, was passed\r\ndefining the rights and the duties of the Commissars. The Commanding\r\nStaffs, at any rate, were unaware of such laws, and this alone gave\r\nrise to all the misunderstandings and conflicts that followed. The\r\nCommissars had secret instructions to watch the Commanding Staffs and\r\nHeadquarters in respect of their political reliability. From that\r\npoint of view the democratic régime went further, perhaps, than the\r\nautocratic. Of this I became convinced during my command of the Western\r\nand South-Western Fronts, in reading the telegrams exchanged between\r\nthe Commissariats and Petrograd. These telegrams--may the Commissars\r\nforgive me!--were handed to me, de-coded, by my Staff, immediately\r\nafter their despatch. This part of the Commissars' duty required a\r\ncertain training in political intelligence, but their overt duties were\r\ninfinitely more complex: they demanded statesmanship, a clear knowledge\r\nof the aims to be pursued, an understanding of the psychology, not\r\nmerely of the officers and men, but of the Senior Commanding Staff,\r\nacquaintance with the fundamental principles of service and routine in\r\nthe Army, great tact, and, finally, the personal qualities of courage,\r\nstrong will, and energy. Only such qualifications were capable of\r\nmitigating to a certain degree the disastrous consequences of a measure\r\nwhich deprived (to be more accurate, sanctioned the deprivation of) the\r\nCommanding Officers of the possibility of influencing the troops--that\r\ninfluence being the only means of strengthening the hope and faith in\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nSuch elements were not to be found, unfortunately, in the circles\r\nconnected with the Government and the Soviet and enjoying their\r\nconfidence. The personnel of the Commissars whom I met may be described\r\nthus: War-time officers, doctors, solicitors, newspaper men, exiles\r\nand _emigrés_ completely out of touch with Russian life, members of\r\nmilitant Revolutionary organisations, etc. These men had, obviously,\r\ninadequate knowledge of the Army. All these men belonged to Socialist\r\nparties, from Social-Democrat Mensheviks to the group \"Edinstvo\"\r\n(unity), War party blinkers, and very often did not follow the\r\npolitical lines of the Government because they considered themselves\r\ntied by Soviet and party discipline. Owing to political differences of\r\nopinion, the attitude of the Commissars towards the War also varied.\r\nStankevitch, one of the Commissars, who carried out his duties in his\r\nown way most conscientiously, when proceeding to visit an advancing\r\nDivision was beset with doubts: \"The soldiers believe that we do not\r\nwish to deceive them; they force themselves, therefore, to forget\r\ntheir doubts, and they go forward to death and murder. But we, are we\r\nentitled not only to encourage them, but to take upon ourselves the\r\ndecision?\" According to Savinkov (who was Commissar of the Seventh\r\nArmy of the South-Western Front, and later War Minister), not all the\r\nCommissars agreed upon the question of Bolshevism, and not all of\r\nthem considered a resolute struggle against the Bolsheviks possible\r\nor desirable. Savinkov was an exception. Although not a soldier by\r\nprofession, he was steeled in struggle and wanderings, in constant\r\ndanger, and his hands were stained with the blood of political victims.\r\nThis man, however, understood the laws of the struggle, threw off the\r\nyoke of the party, and fought more resolutely than others against the\r\ndisorganisation of the Army. But the personal touch in his attitude\r\ntowards the events was somewhat too marked. None of the Commissars,\r\nwith the exception of very few men of the Savinkov type, displayed\r\npersonal strength or energy. They were men of words, not of deeds.\r\nTheir lack of training would not have had such negative results had it\r\nnot been for the fact that, their functions not being clearly defined,\r\nthey gradually began to interfere with every feature of the life and\r\nservice of the troops, partly on their own initiative, partly at the\r\ninstigation of the men and of the Army Committees, and partly even\r\nof Commanding Officers, who were trying to escape responsibility.\r\nQuestions of appointments, dismissals, and even operative plans\r\nattracted the attention of the Commissars, not only from the point of\r\nview of \"covert counter-Revolution,\" but from the point of view of\r\npracticability. The confusion in their minds was so great that the\r\nweaker elements among the Commanding Staffs were sometimes completely\r\ndisheartened. I remember one case during the July retreat on the\r\nSouth-Western Front. One of the Army Corps Commanders rashly destroyed\r\na well-equipped military railway, thereby placing the Army in an\r\nexceedingly difficult position. He was dismissed by the Army Commander,\r\nand afterwards expressed to me his sincere astonishment: \"Why had he\r\nbeen dismissed? He had acted--upon the instructions of the Commissar.\"\r\n\r\nThe Commissars carried out the ideas of the Soviet and whole-heartedly\r\ndefended the sacred newly-acquired rights of the soldier, but failed\r\nto fulfil their primary duty--direct the political life of the Army.\r\nVery often the most destructive propaganda was permitted. Soldiers'\r\nmeetings and Committees were allowed to pass all kinds of anti-National\r\nand anti-Government resolutions, and the Commissars only interfered\r\nwhen the tension of the atmosphere resulted in an armed mutiny. Such a\r\npolicy puzzled the troops, the Committees, and the Commanding Officers.\r\n\r\nThe institution of Commissars did not attain its purpose. Among the\r\nsoldiers the Commissars could not be popular because they were to\r\na certain extent an instrument of compulsion, and occasionally of\r\nsuppression. At the same time, the extent of their power was not\r\nwell defined, and they could not gain proper authority over the most\r\nundisciplined units. This was confirmed later after the seizure of\r\npower by the Bolsheviks, when the Commissars were the first to flee\r\nfrom their posts in a great hurry and in secret.\r\n\r\nThere thus appeared in the Russian Army, instead of one authority,\r\nthree different authorities, which excluded one another--the Commanding\r\nOfficer, the Committee, and the Commissar. They were shadowy\r\nauthorities. Another authority was overhanging, and was oppressing them\r\nmorally with all its insensate weight--the power of the mob.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn examining the question of the new Institutions--Commissars and\r\nCommittees--and of their bearing upon the destinies of the Russian\r\nArmy, I have done so solely from the point of view of the preservation\r\nof our Armed Forces as an important factor in the future of our\r\ncountry. It would, however, be a mistake to overlook the connection\r\nbetween these measures and the entirety of laws which govern the\r\nlife of the people and the course of the Revolution. These measures,\r\nmoreover, bear the stamp of logic and of inevitability owing to the\r\npart which the Revolutionary Democracy had chosen to play. Therein lies\r\nthe tragedy of the situation. The Socialist Democracy did not possess\r\nany elements sufficiently trained to become the instruments of Army\r\nAdministration. At the same time, it did not have the courage or the\r\npossibility to quell the resistance of the Bourgeois Democracy and of\r\nthe Commanding Staffs, and to compel them to work for the glorification\r\nof Socialism, as the Bolsheviks afterwards did, who forced the remnants\r\nof the Russian _intelligencia_ and of the officers to serve Communism\r\nby applying methods of sanguinary and ruthless extermination. When the\r\nRevolutionary Democracy actually assumed power and set up to fulfil\r\ncertain aims it was well aware of the fact that those elements in\r\nthe administration and the Command who were called upon to carry out\r\nthese aims did not share the views of the Revolutionary Democracy.\r\nHence the inevitable distrust of these elements and the desire to\r\nweaken their influence and their authority. What methods did the\r\nDemocracy have recourse to? As the Central Revolutionary organ was\r\nutterly devoid of statesmanship and of patriotism, it applied in its\r\nstruggle against political opponents destructive methods, completely\r\ndisregarding the fact that by these methods they were destroying the\r\ncountry and the Army. Another circumstance must be borne in mind--the\r\nRevolution that had shaken the State to its very foundations and upset\r\nthe established class relations occurred at the moment when the flower\r\nof the Nation--over 10,000,000 men--were under arms. Elections to the\r\nConstituent Assembly were impending. In these circumstances it was\r\nimpossible to avoid politics being introduced into the Army, as it is\r\nimpossible to arrest the course of a river. But it would have been\r\npossible to divert it to proper channels. In this matter, however, the\r\ntwo contending forces (that which wished to preserve the State and the\r\nDemagogic Force) also collided, as both endeavoured to influence the\r\nattitude of the Army, which was a decisive factor in the Revolution.\r\n\r\nThese were the propositions which pre-ordained and explained the\r\nsubsequent course of the Democratisation of the Army. The Socialist\r\nDemocracy, which governed at first behind the scenes and then overtly,\r\nwas endeavouring to strengthen its position and to bow to the\r\ninstincts of the crowd, destroyed the military power and connived at\r\nthe Institution of Elective Military Organisations, which were less\r\ndangerous and more open to its influence than the Commanding Staffs,\r\nalthough they did not answer the requirements of the Soviet. The\r\nnecessity of military authority of some sort was clearly realised.\r\nThe Commanding Staffs were distrusted, and there was a desire to\r\ncreate a buffer between the two artificially separated elements of\r\nthe Army. These considerations inspired the creation of the office of\r\nCommissars, who bore the dual responsibility before the Soviet and the\r\nGovernment. Neither the men nor the officers were satisfied with these\r\ninstitutions, which fell together with the Provisional Government, were\r\nrevived with certain modifications in the Red Army, and once again\r\nswept away by the tide of events.\r\n\r\n\"Peoples cannot choose their Institutions, as man cannot choose his\r\nage. Peoples obey the Institutions to which they are tied by their\r\npast, their creed, by the economic laws and surroundings in which they\r\nlive. There are many examples in history when the people have destroyed\r\nby violent Revolution the Institutions which it has taken a dislike\r\nfor. But there is not a case in history of these new institutions\r\nforcibly imposed upon the people becoming permanent and solid. After a\r\nwhile the past comes again into force, because we are created entirely\r\nby that past and it is our supreme ruler.\"[19]\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the Russian National Army will be revived not only\r\non democratic, but on historical foundations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n    THE DEMOCRATISATION OF THE ARMY--THE STORY OF \"THE DECLARATION OF\r\n    THE RIGHTS OF THE SOLDIER.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ill-famed law, emanating from the Polivanov Committee and known\r\nas the \"Declaration of the Rights of the Soldier,\" was confirmed by\r\nKerensky on May 9th. I will give the main points of that law:\r\n\r\n    (1) \"All soldiers of the Army enjoy full rights of citizenship.\"\r\n\r\n    (2) Every soldier is entitled to the membership of any political,\r\n    national, religious, economic, or professional organisation,\r\n    society or union.\r\n\r\n    (3) Every soldier off duty has the right freely and openly to\r\n    express in word, writing, or in the Press his political, religious,\r\n    social and other views.\r\n\r\n    (4) All printed matter (periodicals and other) should be delivered\r\n    to the addressees.\r\n\r\n    (5) Soldiers are not to be appointed as orderlies. Officers are\r\n    entitled to have one servant, appointed by mutual consent (of the\r\n    soldier and of the officer); wages also to be settled by mutual\r\n    consent, but there should be no more than one servant to each\r\n    officer, Army doctor, Army clerk, or Priest.\r\n\r\n    (6) Saluting is abolished for men as well as for units.\r\n\r\n    (7) No soldier is to be punished or fined without trial. At\r\n    the Front the Commanding Officer is entitled, on his own\r\n    responsibility, to take the necessary steps, including armed\r\n    force, against disobedient subordinates. Such steps are not to be\r\n    considered as disciplinary punishments. Internal administration,\r\n    punishments, and control in cases defined by Army regulations,\r\n    belong to elective Army Organisations.\r\n\r\nThis \"Declaration of Rights,\" of which the above is but a brief\r\nsummary, gave official sanction to the malady with which the Army\r\nwas stricken, and which spread in varying degrees owing to mutinies,\r\nviolence, and \"by Revolutionary methods,\" as the current expression\r\ngoes. It dealt a death-blow to the old Army. It introduced boundless\r\npolitical discussions and social strife into the unbalanced ARMED\r\nMASSES which had already become aware of their rough physical power.\r\n\"The Declaration\" admitted and sanctioned wide propaganda by speech and\r\npamphlet of anti-national, immoral and anti-Social doctrines, and even\r\nthe doctrines that repudiated the State and the very existence of the\r\nArmy. Finally, it deprived Commanding Officers of disciplinary power,\r\nwhich was handed over to elective bodies, and once again insulted and\r\ndegraded the Commanding Staff. In his remarks attached to the text of\r\nthe \"Declaration,\" Kerensky says: \"Let the freest Army and Navy of the\r\nWorld prove that there is strength and not weakness in Liberty, let\r\nthem forge a new iron discipline of duty and raise the Armed Power of\r\nthe country.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the \"Great Silent One,\" as the French picturesquely describe the\r\nArmy, began to talk and to shout louder and louder still, enforcing its\r\ndemands by threats, by arms, and by shedding the blood of those who\r\ndared to resist its folly.\r\n\r\nAt the end of April the final draft of the \"Declaration\" was sent by\r\nGutchkov to the Stavka for approval. The Supreme Commander-in-Chief and\r\nmyself returned an emphatic disapproval, in which we gave vent to all\r\nour moral sufferings and our grief for the dark future of the Army. Our\r\nconclusion was that the \"Declaration\" \"was the last nail driven into\r\nthe coffin which has been prepared for the Russian Army.\" On May 1st\r\nGutchkov resigned from the War Ministry, as he did not wish \"to share\r\nthe responsibility for the heavy sin which was committed against the\r\nMother Country,\" and in particular to sign the \"Declaration.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Stavka sent copies of the draft \"Declaration\" to the\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Fronts for reference, and they were called\r\nby General Alexeiev to Moghilev, in order to discuss the fateful\r\nposition. This historical Conference took place on May 2nd. The\r\nspeeches, in which the collapse of the Russian Army was described,\r\nwere restrained and yet moving, as they reflected deep sorrow and\r\napprehension. Brussilov, in a low voice expressing sincere and unfeigned\r\npain, ended thus: \"All this can yet be borne, and there still remains\r\nsome hope of saving the Army and leading it forward, provided the\r\n'Declaration' is not issued. If it is, there is no salvation, and I\r\nwould not remain in office for a single day.\" This last sentence\r\nprovoked a warm protest from General Stcherbatchov, who argued that no\r\none should resign, that, however arduous and hopeless the position may\r\nbe, the leaders cannot abandon the Army.... Somebody suggested that all\r\nthe Commanders-in-Chief should immediately proceed to Petrograd,\r\nand address to the Provisional Government a stern warning and\r\ndefinite demands. The General who suggested this thought that such a\r\ndemonstration would produce a very strong impression and might arrest\r\nthe progress of destructive legislation. Others thought that it was a\r\ndangerous expedient and our last trump card, and that, should the step\r\nprove ineffective, the High Command would be definitely discredited. The\r\nsuggestion, however, was accepted, and, on the 4th May, a Conference took\r\nplace of all the Commanders-in-Chief (with the exception of the Caucasian\r\nFront), the Provisional Government, and the Executive Committee of\r\nthe Soviet. I am in possession of the record of that Conference, of\r\nwhich I give extensive extracts below. The condition of the Army, such\r\nas it appeared to its leaders, in the course of events, and without,\r\ntherefore, any historical perspective, is therein described, as well as\r\nthe characteristics of the men who were then in power. The trend of the\r\nspeeches made by the Commander-in-Chief was the same as in the Stavka,\r\nbut they were less emphatic and less sincere. Brussilov smoothed\r\nover his accusations, lost his pathos, \"warmly greeted the Coalition\r\nMinistry,\" and did not repeat his threat of resignation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RECORD.\r\n\r\n_General Alexeiev._--I consider it necessary to speak quite frankly. We\r\nare all united in wishing for the good of our country. Our paths may\r\ndiffer, but we have a common goal of ending the War in such a manner as\r\nto allow Russia to come out of it unbroken, albeit tired and suffering.\r\nOnly victory can give us the desired consummation. Only then will\r\ncreative work be possible. But victory must be achieved, and that is\r\nonly possible if the orders of the Commanding Officers are obeyed. If\r\nnot, it is not an Army, but a mob. To sit in the trenches does not mean\r\nto reach the end of the War. The enemy is transferring, in great haste,\r\ndivision after division from our Front to the Franco-British Front, and\r\nwe continue to sit still. Meanwhile, the conditions are most favourable\r\nfor our victory, but we must advance in order to win it. Our Allies are\r\nlosing faith in us. We must reckon with this in the diplomatic sphere,\r\nand I particularly in the military one. It seemed as if the Revolution\r\nwould raise our spirits, would give us impetus, and therefore victory.\r\nIn that, unfortunately, we have so far been mistaken. Not only is\r\nthere no enthusiasm or impetus, but the lowest instincts have come\r\nto the fore, such as self-preservation. The interests of the Mother\r\nCountry and its future are not being considered.... You will ask what\r\nhas happened to the authority, to principles, or even to physical\r\ncompulsion? I am bound to state that the reforms to which the Army\r\nhas as yet failed to adapt itself have shaken it, have undermined\r\norder and discipline. Discipline is the mainstay of the Army. If we\r\nfollow that path any further there will be a complete collapse....\r\nThe Commanders-in-Chief will give you a series of facts describing\r\nthe condition of the Armies. I will offer a conclusion and will give\r\nexpression to our desires and demands, which must be complied with.\r\n\r\n_General Brussilov._--I must first of all describe to you the present\r\ncondition of the officers and men. Cavalry, artillery and engineering\r\ntroops have retained about 50 per cent. of their cadres. But in\r\nthe infantry, which is the mainstay of the Army, the position is\r\nentirely different. Owing to enormous casualties in killed, wounded\r\nand prisoners, as well as many deserters, some regiments have changed\r\ntheir cadres nine or ten times, so that only from three to ten men\r\nremain of the original formation. Reinforcements are badly trained\r\nand their discipline is still worse. Of the regular officers from two\r\nto four remain and in many cases they are wounded. Other officers\r\nare youngsters commissioned after a short training and enjoying no\r\nauthority owing to their lack of experience. It is upon these new\r\ncadres that the task has fallen to remodel the Army on a new basis, and\r\nthat task has so far proved beyond their capacity. Although we felt\r\nthat a change was necessary and that it had already come too late, the\r\nground was nevertheless unprepared. The uneducated soldier understood\r\nit as a deliverance from the officers' yoke. The officers greeted the\r\nchange with enthusiasm. Had this not been so, the Revolution may not\r\nhave probably passed so smoothly. The result, however, was that freedom\r\nwas only given to the men, whereas the officers had to be content\r\nto play the part of pariahs of liberty. The unconscious masses were\r\nintoxicated with liberty. Everyone knows that extensive rights have\r\nbeen granted, but they do not know what these rights are, and nobody\r\nbothers about duties. The position of the officers is very difficult.\r\nFrom 15 to 20 per cent. have rapidly adapted themselves to the new\r\nconditions, because they believed that these conditions were all to\r\nthe good. Those of the officers who were trusted by the men did not\r\nlose that trust. Some, however, became too familiar with the men, were\r\ntoo lenient and even encouraged internal dissensions amongst the men.\r\nBut the majority of the officers, about 75 per cent., were unable to\r\nadapt themselves. They were offended, retired to the background and\r\ndo not know what to do now. We are trying to bring them into contact\r\nwith the soldiers once more, because we need the officers for continued\r\nfighting, and we have no other cadres. Many of the officers have no\r\npolitical training, do not know how to make speeches--and this, of\r\ncourse, handicaps the work of mutual understanding. It is necessary to\r\nexplain and to instil into the masses the idea that freedom has been\r\ngranted to _everyone_. I have known our soldiers for forty-five years,\r\nI love them and I will do my best to bring them into close touch with\r\nthe officers, but the Provisional Government, the Duma and particularly\r\nthe Soviet should also make every effort in order to assist in that\r\nwork which must be done as soon as possible in the interests of the\r\ncountry. It is also necessary, owing to the peculiar fashion in\r\nwhich the illiterate masses have understood the watchword \"without\r\nannexations and indemnities.\" One of the regiments has declared that\r\nnot only would it refuse to advance, but desired to leave the front and\r\nto go home. The Committees opposed this tendency, but were told that\r\nthey would be dismissed. I had a lengthy argument with the regiment,\r\nand when I asked the men whether they agreed with me, they begged leave\r\nto give me a written answer. A few minutes later they presented to me\r\na poster: \"Peace at any price and down with the War.\" In the course of\r\na subsequent talk I had with one of the men, he said to me: \"If there\r\nare to be no annexations, why do we want that hill top?\" My reply\r\nwas: \"I also do not want the hill top, but we must beat the enemy who\r\nis occupying it.\" Finally, the men promised to hold on, but refused\r\nto advance, arguing that \"the enemy is good to us and has informed\r\nus that he will not advance provided we do not move. It is important\r\nthat we should go home to enjoy freedom and the land. Why should we\r\nallow ourselves to be maimed?\" Is it to be an offensive or a defensive\r\ncampaign? Success can be only obtained by an offensive. If we conduct\r\na passive defence the front is bound to be broken. If discipline is\r\nstrong a break-through may yet be remedied. But we must not forget that\r\nwe have no well-disciplined troops, that they are badly trained and\r\nthat the officers have no authority. In these circumstances an enemy\r\nsuccess may easily become a catastrophe. The masses must, therefore, be\r\npersuaded that we must advance instead of remaining on the defensive.\r\n\r\nWe thus have many shortcomings, but numerical superiority is still\r\non our side. If the enemy succeeds in breaking the French and the\r\nBritish, he will throw his entire weight upon us and we will then be\r\nlost. We need a strong government upon which we could rely, and we\r\nwhole-heartedly greet the coalition government. The power of the State\r\ncan only be strong when it leans upon the Army, which represents the\r\narmed forces of the nation.\r\n\r\n_General Dragomirov._--The prevailing spirit in the Army is the\r\ndesire of peace. Anyone might be popular in the Army who would preach\r\npeace without annexations and would advocate self-determination. The\r\nilliterate masses have understood the idea of \"no annexations\" in a\r\npeculiar fashion. They do not understand the conditions of different\r\npeoples, and they repeatedly ask the question: \"Why do not the Allied\r\ndemocracies join in our declarations?\" The desire for peace is so\r\nstrong that reinforcements refuse to accept equipment and arms and say:\r\n\"They are no good to us as we do not intend to fight.\" Work has come to\r\na standstill and it is even necessary to see to it that trenches are\r\nnot dismantled and that roads are mended. In one of the best regiments\r\nwe found, on the sector which it had occupied, a red banner inscribed:\r\n\"Peace at all costs.\" The officer who tore that banner had to flee for\r\nhis life. During the night men from that regiment were searching for\r\nthe officer at Dvinsk, as he had been concealed by the Headquarters\r\nStaff. The dreadful expression \"Adherents of the old régime\" caused\r\nthe best officers to be cast out of the Army. We all wanted a change,\r\nand yet many excellent officers, the pride of the Army, had to join\r\nthe Reserve simply because they tried to prevent the disruption of the\r\nArmy, but failed to adapt themselves to the new conditions. What is\r\nmuch more fatal is the growth of slackness and of a lingering spirit.\r\nEgoism is reaching terrible proportions, and each unit thinks only of\r\nits own welfare; endless deputations come to us daily, demanding to\r\nbe relieved, to remove Commanding Officers, to be re-equipped, etc.\r\nAll these deputations have to be addressed, and this hinders our work.\r\nOrders that used to be implicitly obeyed now demand lengthy arguments;\r\nif a battery is moved to a different sector, there is immediate\r\ndiscontent, and the men say: \"You are weakening us--you are traitors.\"\r\nOwing to the weakness of the Baltic Fleet, we found it necessary to\r\nsend an Army Corps to the rear to meet the eventual landing of an enemy\r\nforce, but we were unable to do so, because the men said: \"Our line\r\nis long enough as it is and if we lengthen it still more we will be\r\nunable to hold the enemy.\" Formerly we had no difficulty whatsoever\r\nin regrouping the troops. In September, 1915, eleven Army Corps were\r\nremoved from the Western front, and this saved us from a defeat which\r\nmight have decided the fate of the War. At present such a thing would\r\nbe impossible, as every unit raises objections to the slightest move.\r\nIt is very difficult to compel the men to do anything in the interests\r\nof the Mother Country. Regiments refuse to relieve their comrades\r\nin the firing line under various excuses--such as bad weather, or\r\nthe fact that not all their men had had their baths. On one occasion\r\na unit refused to go to the front on the plea that it had already\r\nbeen in the firing line at Easter time. We are compelled to ask the\r\nCommittees of various regiments to argue the matter out. Only a small\r\nminority of officers is behaving in an undignified manner, trying to\r\nmake themselves popular by bowing to the instincts of the men. The\r\nsystem of elections has not been introduced in its entirety, but many\r\nunpopular officers have been summarily dismissed as they were accused\r\nof being adherents to the old régime; other Commanding Officers, who\r\nhad been considered incompetent and liable to dismissal, have been made\r\nto stay. It was quite impossible not to grant the demands for their\r\nretention. With regard to excesses there have been individual cases of\r\nshootings of officers.... Things cannot continue on these lines. We\r\nwant strong power. We have fought for the country. You have taken the\r\nground from under our feet. Will you kindly restore it? Our obligations\r\nare colossal, and we must have the power in order to be able to lead to\r\nvictory the millions of soldiers who are entrusted to our care.\r\n\r\n_General Stcherbatchov._--The illiteracy of the soldiery is the main\r\nreason of all these phenomena. It is not, of course, the fault of our\r\npeople that it is illiterate. For this the old régime is entirely\r\nresponsible, as it looked upon education from the point of view of the\r\nMinistry of the Interior. Nevertheless, we have to reckon with the fact\r\nthat the masses do not understand the gravity of our position, and that\r\nthey misinterpret even such ideas as may be considered reasonable....\r\nIf we do not wish Russia to collapse, we must continue the struggle\r\nand we must advance. Otherwise we shall witness a grotesque sight.\r\nThe representatives of oppressed Russia fought heroically; but having\r\noverthrown the government that was striving for peace with dishonour,\r\nthe citizens of free Russia are refusing to fight and to safeguard\r\ntheir liberties. This is grotesque, strange, incomprehensible. But it\r\nis so. The reason is that discipline has gone and there is no faith\r\nin the Commanding Officers. Mother Country, to most men, is an empty\r\nsound. These conditions are most painful, but they are particularly\r\npainful on the Roumanian front, where one has to reckon not only with\r\nmilitary surroundings of specific difficulty, but also with a very\r\ncomplex political atmosphere. Our people are used to plains, and the\r\nmountainous nature of the theatre of war has a depressing effect upon\r\nthe troops. We often hear the complaint: \"Do not keep us in these\r\ncursed mountains.\" We have only one railway line to rely upon for\r\nsupplies, and have great difficulty in feeding the troops. This, of\r\ncourse, enhances discontent. The fact that we are fighting on Roumanian\r\nterritory is interpreted as a fight \"for Roumania,\" which is also an\r\nunpopular idea. The attitude of the local population is not always\r\nfriendly, and the men come to the conclusion that they are being\r\nrefused assistance by those on whose behalf they are fighting. Friction\r\nthus arises and deepens, because some of the Roumanians blame us for\r\nthe defeats which they have themselves suffered and owing to which\r\nthey have lost most of their territory and of their belongings. The\r\nRoumanian Government and the Allied representatives are well aware of\r\nthe ferment in our Army, and their attitude towards us is changing.\r\nI personally noticed that a shadow has fallen between us, and that\r\nthe former respect and faith in the prowess of the Russian Army have\r\nvanished. I still enjoy great authority, but if the disruption of the\r\nArmy continues not only shall we lose our Allies but make enemies of\r\nthem, and there would then be a danger of peace being made at our\r\nexpense. In 1914 we advanced across the whole of Galicia. In 1915, in\r\nour retreat, we took at the South-Western front 100,000 prisoners.\r\nYou may judge what that retreat was like and what was the spirit of\r\nthe troops. In the summer of 1916 we saved Italy from disaster. Is\r\nit possible that we may now abandon the Allied cause and be false to\r\nour obligations? The Army is in a state of disruption, but that can\r\nbe remedied. Should we succeed, within a month and a half our brave\r\nofficers and men would advance again. History will wonder at the\r\ninadequate means with which we achieved brilliant results in 1916. If\r\nyou wish to raise the Russian Army and to convert it into a strong\r\norganised body which will dictate the terms of peace, you must help us.\r\nAll is not lost yet, but only on condition that the Commanding Officers\r\nwill regain prestige and confidence. We hope that full powers in the\r\nArmy will once again be vested in the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, who\r\nalone can manage the troops. We will obey the will of the Provisional\r\nGovernment, but you must give us strong support.\r\n\r\n_General Gourko._--If you wish to continue the War till the desired\r\nend, you must restore the power of the Army. We have received the draft\r\nof the \"Declaration\" (of the rights of the soldier). Gutchkov would\r\nnot sign it and has resigned. I am bound to say that if a civilian\r\nhas resigned and refused to sign that declaration--to us, the Army\r\nChiefs, it is inacceptable. It simply completely destroys everything\r\nthat is left. I will recount to you an episode which occurred while I\r\nwas temporarily holding the office of Chief-of-Staff of the Supreme\r\nC.-in-C.\r\n\r\nOn February 13th I had a long talk with the late Czar, trying to\r\npersuade him to grant a responsible ministry. As a last trump card, I\r\nalluded to our international position, to the attitude of our Allies\r\nand to the probable consequences of this measure. But my card was\r\nalready beaten. I will now endeavour to describe our international\r\nposition. We have no direct indication of the attitude of our Allies\r\ntowards our intentions to give up the struggle. We cannot, of course,\r\nforce them to express their innermost thoughts. As in time of war, one\r\nis often compelled to come to a decision \"for the enemy,\" I will now\r\ntry to argue \"for the Allies.\"\r\n\r\nIt was easy to begin the Revolution, but we have been submerged by its\r\ntidal wave. I trust that common sense will help us to survive this. If\r\nnot, if the Allies realise our impotence, the principles of practical\r\npolicy will force upon them the only issue--a separate peace. That\r\nwould not be on their part a breach of obligations, because we had\r\npromised to fight together and have now come to a standstill. If one\r\nof the parties is fighting and the other is sitting in the trenches,\r\nlike a Chinese dragon, waiting for the result of the fight--you must\r\nagree that the fighting side may begin to think of making separate\r\npeace. Such a peace would, of course, be concluded at our expense.\r\nThe Austrians and the Germans can get nothing from our Allies: their\r\nfinance is in a state of collapse and they have no natural riches.\r\nOur finances are also in a state of collapse, but we have immense\r\nuntouched natural resources. Our Allies would, of course, come to such\r\na decision only as a last resort, because it would be not peace, but a\r\nlengthy armistice. Bred as they are upon the ideals of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, the Germans, having enriched themselves at our expense, would\r\nonce again fall upon us and upon our late Allies. You may say that if\r\nthis is possible why should we not conclude a separate peace first.\r\nHere I will mention first of all the moral aspect of the question. The\r\nobligation was undertaken by Russia, not merely by the late autocrat.\r\nI was aware--long before you had heard of it--of the duplicity of the\r\nCzar, who had concluded soon after the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-5 an\r\nalliance with the Emperor William, while the Franco-Russian Alliance\r\nwas still in existence. The free Russian people, responsible for its\r\nacts, cannot renounce its obligations. But setting aside the moral\r\naspect, there remains the material problem. If we open negotiations\r\nthey cannot remain secret, and our Allies would hear of it within\r\ntwo or three days. They would also enter into a parley, and a kind\r\nof auction sale would begin. The Allies are, of course, richer than\r\nourselves, but on their side the struggle has not yet ended; besides,\r\nour enemies could get much more at our expense. It is precisely from\r\nthe international point of view that we must prove our capacity for\r\na continued struggle. I will not continue to revolutionise the Army,\r\nbecause if I should we might find ourselves powerless not only to\r\nadvance but even to remain on the defensive. The latter is infinitely\r\nmore difficult. In 1915 we retreated and orders were obeyed. You\r\nwere entitled to expect this, because we had trained the Army. The\r\nposition has now been altered; you have created something new and have\r\ndeprived us of power. You can no longer hold us responsible, and the\r\nresponsibility must fall heavily upon your heads. You say that the\r\nRevolution is still proceeding. Listen to us. We are better acquainted\r\nwith the psychology of the troops, we have gone with them through\r\nthick and thin. Stop the Revolution and give us, the military Chiefs,\r\na chance to do our duty and to bring Russia to such a condition in\r\nwhich you may continue your work. Otherwise, we will hand over to you\r\nnot Russia, but a field in which our enemies will sow and reap, and\r\nDemocracy itself will curse you. It will be Democracy that will suffer\r\nif the Germans win. Democracy will be starving--while the peasants will\r\nalways manage to feed themselves on their own land. It was said of\r\nthe old régime that it \"played into the hands of William.\" Will it be\r\npossible to level the same accusation against you? William is fortunate\r\nindeed, as both Monarchs and Democracies are playing into his hands.\r\nThe Army is on the eve of disruption. Our Mother Country is in danger\r\nand is nearing a collapse. You must help. It is easy to destroy, and if\r\nyou know how to destroy--you should also know how to rebuild.\r\n\r\n_General Alexeiev._--The main points have been stated, and they are\r\ntrue. The Army is on the brink of the abyss. Another step and it will\r\nfall into the abyss and will drag along Russia and all her liberties,\r\nand there will be no return. Everyone is guilty, and the guilt lies\r\nheavily upon all that has been done in that direction for the last\r\ntwo and a half months. We have made every effort and are now devoting\r\nall our strength to the task of restoring the Army. We trust that Mr.\r\nKerensky will apply all his qualities of mind and character and all\r\nhis influence to that consummation, and will help us. But that is\r\nnot enough. Those who have been disrupting the Army must also help.\r\nThose who have issued the Order No. 1 must issue a series of orders\r\nand comments. If the \"Declaration\" is published, as Gutchkov said,\r\nthe last flimsy foundations will fall into dust and the last hope\r\nwill be dashed. Be patient, there is time still. That which has been\r\ngranted in the last two and a half months has not as yet taken root.\r\nWe have regulations defining rights and duties. All the regulations\r\nthat are issued nowadays only mention rights. You must do away with\r\nthe idea that peace will come by itself. Those who say \"down with the\r\nWar\" are traitors, and those who say \"there should be no advance\"\r\nare cowards. We still have men with sincere convictions. Let them\r\ncome to us not as passing stars, but let them live with us and dispel\r\nthe misunderstandings that have arisen. You have the Press. May it\r\nencourage patriotism and demand that everyone do his duty.\r\n\r\n_Prince Lvov._--We have heard the Commanders-in-Chief, we understand\r\nall they have said and will do our duty to our country till the end.\r\n\r\n_Tzeretelli._--There is no one here who has contributed to the\r\ndisruption of the Army and played into the hands of William. I have\r\nheard the accusation that the Soviet has contributed to the disruption\r\nof the Army. And yet everyone agrees that the Soviet is the only\r\ninstitution that enjoys authority at present. What would happen were\r\nthere no Soviet? Fortunately, Democracy has come to the rescue and\r\nwe still have hope in salvation. What can you do? There are only two\r\npaths for you to follow. One is to reject the policy of the Soviets.\r\nBut you would then have no source of power wherewith to hold the Army\r\nand to lead it for the salvation of Russia. Your other path is the\r\ntrue path, which we have tried; the path of unity with the desires\r\nand expectations of the people. If the Commanding Officers have\r\nfailed to make it quite clear that the whole strength of the Army\r\nfor the defence of the country lay in the advance, there is no magic\r\nwand capable of doing it. It is alleged that the watchword \"Without\r\nannexations or indemnities\" has demoralised the Army and the masses.\r\nIt is quite likely that it has been misunderstood, but it should have\r\nbeen explained that this was the ultimate aim; we cannot renounce that\r\nwatchword. We are aware that Russia is in danger, but her defence is\r\na matter for the people as a whole. The Power must be united and must\r\nenjoy the confidence of the people, but this can only be achieved\r\nif the old policy is completely discarded. Unity can only be based\r\non confidence, which cannot be bought. The ideals of the Soviet are\r\nnot those of separate and small groups--they are the ideals of the\r\ncountry. To renounce them is to renounce the country. You might,\r\nperhaps, understand Order No. 1 if you knew the conditions in which it\r\nwas issued. We were confronted with an unorganised mob and we had to\r\norganise it. The masses of the soldiery do not wish to go on with the\r\nWar. They are wrong, and I cannot believe that they are prompted by\r\ncowardice. It is the result of distrust. Discipline should remain. But\r\nif the soldiers realise that you are not fighting against Democracy,\r\nthey will trust you. By this means the Army may yet be saved. By this\r\nmeans the authority of the Soviet will be strengthened. There is only\r\none way of salvation, the way of confidence and of the Democratisation\r\nof the country and of the Army. It is by accepting those principles\r\nthat the Soviet has gained the confidence of the people and is now in\r\na position to carry out its ideas. As long as that is so, not all is\r\nlost. You must try to enhance the confidence in the Soviet.\r\n\r\n_Skobelev._--We have not come here to listen to reproaches. We know\r\nwhat is going on in the Army. The conditions which you have described\r\nare undoubtedly ominous. It will depend upon the spirit of the Russian\r\npeople whether the ultimate goal will be reached and whether we shall\r\ncome out of the present difficulty with honour. I consider it necessary\r\nto explain the circumstances in which Order No. 1 was issued. In the\r\ntroops which had overthrown the old régime, the Commanding Officers\r\nhad not joined the mutineers; we were compelled to issue that Order so\r\nas to deprive these officers of authority. We were anxious about the\r\nattitude of the front towards the Revolution and about the instructions\r\nthat were being given. We have proved to-day that our misgivings were\r\nnot unfounded. Let us speak the truth: the activities of the Commanding\r\nStaff have prevented the Army, in these two and a half months, from\r\nunderstanding the Revolution. We quite realise the difficulties of\r\nyour position. But when you say that the Revolution must be stayed, we\r\nare bound to reply that the Revolution cannot begin or end to order.\r\nRevolution may take its normal course when the mental process of the\r\nRevolution spreads all over the country, when it is understood by the\r\n70 per cent. of illiterate people.\r\n\r\nFar be it from us to demand that all Commanding Officers be elected. We\r\nagree with you that we have power and have succeeded in attaining it.\r\nWhen you will understand the aims of the Revolution and will help the\r\npeople to understand our watchword, you will also acquire the necessary\r\npower. The people must know what they are fighting for. You are leading\r\nthe Army for the defeat of the enemy, and you must explain that a\r\nstrategical advance is necessary in order that the watchwords that\r\nhave been proclaimed may be vindicated. We trust the new War Minister\r\nand hope that a revolutionary Minister will continue our work and will\r\nhasten the mental process of the Revolution in the heads of those who\r\nthink too slowly.\r\n\r\n_The War Minister--Kerensky._--As Minister and Member of the\r\nGovernment, I must say that we are trying to save the country and to\r\nrestore the fighting capacity and activities of the Russian Army. _We\r\nassume responsibility, but we also assume the right to lead the Army_\r\nand to show it the path of future development. Nobody has been uttering\r\nreproaches here. Everyone has described what he has lived through and\r\nhas tried to define the causes of events, but our aims and desires are\r\nthe same. The Provisional Government recognises that the Soviet has\r\nplayed a prominent part and admits its work of organisation--otherwise\r\nI would not be War Minister. No one can level accusations at the\r\nSoviet. But no one can accuse the Commanding Staffs either, because the\r\nofficers have borne the brunt of the Revolution quite as much as the\r\nrest of the Russian people. Everyone understands the position. Now that\r\nmy comrades are joining the Government, it will be easier to attain our\r\ncommon aims. There is but one thing for us to do--to save our freedom.\r\nI will ask you to proceed to your commands and to remember that the\r\nwhole of Russia stands behind you and behind the Army. It is our aim to\r\ngive our country complete freedom. But this cannot be done unless we\r\nshow the world at large that we are strong in spirit.\r\n\r\n_General Gourko_ (replying to Skobelev and Tzeretelli).--We are\r\ndiscussing the matter from different angles. Discipline is the\r\nfundamental condition of the existence of the Army. The percentage of\r\nlosses which a unit may suffer without losing its fighting capacity\r\nis the measure of its endurance. I have spent eight months in the\r\nSouth African Republics and have seen regiments of two different\r\nkinds: (1) Small, disciplined and (2) Volunteer, undisciplined. The\r\nformer continued to fight and did not lose their fighting power when\r\ntheir losses amounted to 50 per cent. The latter, although they were\r\nvolunteers who knew what they were fighting for, left the ranks and\r\nfled from the battlefield after losing 10 per cent. No force on earth\r\ncould induce them to fight. That is the difference between disciplined\r\nand undisciplined troops. We demand discipline. We do all we can to\r\npersuade. But your authoritative voice must be heard. We must remember\r\nthat if the enemy advances, we shall fall to pieces like a pack of\r\ncards. If you will not cease to revolutionise the Army--you must assume\r\npower yourselves.\r\n\r\n_Prince Lvov._--Our ends are the same and everyone will do his duty. I\r\nthank you for your visit and for giving us your views.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Conference came to a close. The Commanders-in-Chief rejoined their\r\nfronts, fully conscious that the last card had been beaten. At the same\r\ntime, the Soviet orators and the Press started a campaign of abuse\r\nagainst Generals Alexeiev, Gourko and Dragomirov, which rendered their\r\nresignations imperative. On the 9th of May, as I already mentioned,\r\nKerensky confirmed the \"Declaration\" while issuing an Order of the Day\r\non the inadmissibility of senior Commanding Officers relinquishing\r\ntheir posts \"in order to shirk responsibility.\" What was the impression\r\nproduced by that fateful Order?\r\n\r\nKerensky _afterwards_ tried to adduce the excuse that the regulation\r\nwas drafted before he had assumed office and was approved of by the\r\nExecutive Committee as well as by \"military authorities,\" and that he\r\nhad no reason to refuse to confirm it; in a word, that he was compelled\r\nto do so. But I recall more than one of Kerensky's speeches in which,\r\nbelieving his course to be the right one, he prided himself on his\r\ncourage in issuing a Declaration \"which Gutchkov had not dared to sign,\r\nand which had evoked the protests of all the Commanding Officers.\"\r\nOn May 13th the Executive Committee of the Soviets responded to the\r\nDeclaration by an enthusiastic proclamation which dwelt mainly upon the\r\nquestion of saluting. Poor, indeed, was the mind that inspired this\r\nverbiage: \"Two months we have waited for this day.... Now the soldier\r\nis by law a citizen.... Henceforward the citizen soldier is free from\r\nthe servile saluting, and will greet anyone he chooses as an equal and\r\nfree man.... In the Revolutionary Army discipline will live through\r\npopular enthusiasm ... and not by means of compulsory saluting....\"\r\nSuch were the men who undertook to reorganise the Army.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the majority of the Revolutionary Democracy of\r\nthe Soviets were not satisfied with the Declaration. They described\r\nit as \"a new enslavement of the soldier,\" and a campaign was opened\r\nfor further widening of these rights. Members of the Defencist\r\ncoalition demanded that the Regimental Committees should be empowered\r\nto challenge the appointments of the Commanding Officers and to give\r\nthem attestations, as well as that freedom of speech should be granted\r\non service. Their chief demand, however, was for the exclusion of\r\nParagraph 14 of the Declaration entitling the Commanding Officer to use\r\narms in the firing line against insubordination. I need hardly mention\r\nthe disapproval of the Left, \"Defeatist\" Section of the Soviet.\r\n\r\nThe Liberal Press utterly failed to appraise the importance of the\r\nDeclaration and never treated it seriously. The official organ of the\r\nConstitutional Democratic Party (_Retch_, May 11th) had an article\r\nwhich expressed great satisfaction that the Declaration \"afforded\r\nevery soldier the chance of taking part in the political life of the\r\ncountry, definitely freed him from the shackles of the old régime and\r\nled him from the stale atmosphere of the old barracks into the fresh\r\nair of liberty.\" It also said that \"throughout the world all other\r\narmies are remote from politics, whilst the Russian Army will be the\r\nfirst to enjoy the fullness of political rights.\" Even the Conservative\r\npaper (_Novoc Vremia_) said in a leading article: \"It is a memorable\r\nday; to-day the great Army of mighty Russia becomes truly the Army\r\nof the Revolution.... Intercourse between warriors of all ranks will\r\nhenceforward be placed upon the common foundation of a sense of duty\r\nbinding on every citizen, irrespective of rank. And the Revolutionary\r\nArmy of regenerated Russia will go forward to the great ordeal of blood\r\nwith faith in victory and in peace.\" Difficult, indeed, was the task\r\nof the Commanding Officers who were endeavouring to preserve the Army\r\nwhen they found that the fundamental principles upon which the very\r\nexistence of the Army depended were misunderstood so grossly, even in\r\ncircles which had heretofore been considered as the mainstay of Russian\r\nstatesmanship.\r\n\r\nThe Commanding Officers were still more disheartened, and the Army fell\r\ninto the abyss with ever-increasing rapidity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESS AND PROPAGANDA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the late World War, along with aeroplanes, tanks, poison gases\r\nand other marvels of military _technique_, a new and powerful weapon\r\ncame to the fore, viz: _propaganda_. Strictly speaking, it was not\r\naltogether new, for as far back as 1826 Canning said, in the House of\r\nCommons: \"Should we ever have to take part in a war we shall gather\r\nunder our flag all the rebels, all those who, with or without cause,\r\nare discontented in the country that goes against us.\" But now this\r\nmeans of conflict attained an extraordinary development, intensity\r\nand organisation, attacking the most morbid and sensitive points of\r\nnational psychology. Organised on a large scale, supplied with vast\r\nmeans, the propaganda organs of Great Britain, France and America,\r\nespecially those of Great Britain, carried on a terrible warfare by\r\nword of mouth, in the Press, in the films and ... with gold, extending\r\nthis warfare over the territories of the enemy, the Allies and the\r\nneutrals, introducing it into all spheres--military, political, moral\r\nand economic. The more so, that Germany especially gave grounds enough\r\nfor propaganda to have a plentiful supply of irrefragable, evidential\r\nmaterial at its disposal. It is difficult to enumerate, even in their\r\ngeneral features alone, that enormous arsenal of ideas which, step by\r\nstep, drop by drop, deepened class differences, undermined the power of\r\nthe State, sapped the moral powers of the enemy and their confidence\r\nin victory, disintegrated their alliance, roused the neutral powers\r\nagainst them and finally raised the falling spirits of their allied\r\npeoples. Nevertheless, we should not attach exceptional importance to\r\nthis external moral pressure, as the leaders of the German people are\r\nnow doing, to justify themselves: Germany has suffered a political,\r\neconomic, military and moral defeat. It was only the interaction of all\r\nthese factors that determined the fatal issue of the struggle, which,\r\ntowards its end, became a lingering death-agony. One could only marvel\r\nat the vitality of the German people, which, by its intellectual power\r\nand the stability of its political thought, held out so long, until at\r\nlast, in November, 1918, \"a double death-blow, both at the front and\r\nin the rear,\" laid it in the dust. In connection with this, history\r\nwill undoubtedly note a great analogy between the parts played by the\r\n\"Revolutionary Democracies\" of Russia and of Germany in the destinies\r\nof these peoples. After the _débâcle_ the leader of the German\r\nIndependent Social Democrats acquainted the country with the great and\r\nsystematic work which they had carried on, from the beginning of 1918,\r\nfor the breaking down of the German Army and Navy, to the glory of the\r\nsocial revolution. In this work one is struck by the similarity of\r\nmethod and _modus operandi_ with those practised in Russia.\r\n\r\nWhile unable to resist British and French propaganda, the Germans were\r\nvery successful in applying this means to their Eastern antagonist, the\r\nmore so that: \"Russia created her own misfortunes,\" said Ludendorff,\r\n\"and the work which we carried on there was not too hard.\"\r\n\r\nThe results of the interaction of the skilful hand of Germany with the\r\nmovements which arose, less from the fact itself of the Revolution than\r\nfrom the individual character of the Russian rebellion, exceeded the\r\nhighest hopes of the Germans.\r\n\r\nThe work was carried on in three directions--political, military and\r\nsocial. In the first we note the idea, quite clearly and definitely\r\nformulated and systematically carried out by the German Government,\r\n_of the dismemberment of Russia_. Its realisation took shape in the\r\nproclamation, on November 15, 1916, of the Kingdom of Poland[20] _with\r\na territory which was to extend eastward \"as far as possible\"_; in the\r\ncreation of the States of Courland and Lithuania--\"independent,\" but\r\nin union with Germany; in the sharing of the White Russian provinces\r\nbetween Poland and Lithuania, and, finally, in the prolonged and very\r\npersistent preparation of the secession of Little Russia, which took\r\nplace later, in 1918. While the former facts had a meaning only in\r\nprinciple, concerning, as they did, territories actually occupied by\r\nthe Germans and defined the character of the future \"annexations,\" the\r\nattitude assumed by the Central Powers with respect to Little Russia\r\nexercised a direct influence on the stability of our South-Western\r\nfront, creating political complications in the country and separatist\r\ntendencies in the Army. I shall return to this question later.\r\n\r\nThe German Headquarters included an excellently organised\r\n\"press-bureau,\" which, besides influencing and directing the home Press,\r\nalso guided German propaganda, which penetrated mainly into Russia and\r\nFrance. Miliukov quotes a circular issued by the German Foreign Office\r\nto all its representatives in neutral countries: \"You are informed that\r\non the territory of the country to which you are accredited, special\r\noffices have been instituted for the organisation of propaganda in the\r\nStates, now fighting with the German coalition. The propaganda will\r\nbe engaged in exciting the social movement and, in connection with\r\nthe latter, strikes, revolutionary outbreaks, separatism, among the\r\nconstituent parts of these States, and civil war, as well as agitation\r\nin favour of disarmament and the cessation of the present sanguinary\r\nslaughter. You are instructed to afford all possible protection and\r\nsupport to the directors of the said propaganda offices.\"\r\n\r\nIt is curious that, in the summer of 1917, the British Press took up\r\narms against Sir George Buchanan and the British Propaganda Ministry\r\nfor their inertness in the matter of influencing the Democracy of\r\nRussia and of fighting German propaganda in that country. One of the\r\npapers pointed out that the British bureau of Russian propaganda had\r\nat its head a novelist and literary beginners who had \"as much idea of\r\nRussia as of Chinese metaphysics.\"\r\n\r\nAs for us, neither in our Government departments nor at the Stavka did\r\nwe have any organ whatever which was even in some degree reminiscent of\r\nthe mighty Western propaganda institutions. One of the sections of the\r\nQuartermaster-General's department had charge of technical questions,\r\nconcerning relations with the Press, and was left without importance,\r\ninfluence, or any active task. The Russian Army, well or badly, fought\r\nin primitive ways, without ever having recourse to that \"poisoning of\r\nthe enemy's spirit,\" which was so widely practised in the West. And it\r\npaid for this with superfluous torrents of blood. But if opinions may\r\ndiffer regarding the morality of destructive propaganda, we cannot but\r\nnote our complete inertness and inactivity in another and perfectly\r\npure sphere. We did absolutely nothing to acquaint foreign public\r\nopinion with the exceptionally important part played by Russia and\r\nthe Russian Army in the World War, with the enormous losses suffered\r\nand the sacrifices made by the Russian people, with those constant\r\nmajestic deeds of self-sacrifice, incomprehensible, perhaps, to the\r\ncold understanding of our Western friends, which the Russian Army made\r\nwhenever the Allied front was within a hair's-breadth of defeat....\r\nSuch a want of comprehension of the part played by Russia I have\r\nmet with almost everywhere, in wide social circles, long after the\r\nconclusion of peace, in my wanderings over Europe.\r\n\r\nThe following small episode is a burlesque, but very characteristic\r\ninstance of this. On a banner presented to Marshal Foch \"from American\r\nfriends\" are depicted the flags of all countries, lands and colonies,\r\nwhich in one way or another came within the orbit of the Entente; the\r\nRussian flag occupies the forty-sixth place, after Hayti and Uruguay\r\nand immediately after San-Marino.\r\n\r\nIs this ignorance or triviality?\r\n\r\nWe did nothing to lay a firm moral foundation for national unity during\r\nour occupation of Galicia, did not draw public opinion to our side\r\nduring the occupation of Roumania by the Russian troops, did nothing\r\nto restrain the Bulgarian people from betraying the interests of the\r\nSlavonic races. Finally, we took no advantage of the presence on\r\nRussian soil of an enormous number of prisoners, to give them at least\r\na correct idea of Russia.\r\n\r\nThe Stavka, firmly barricaded within the sphere of purely military\r\nquestions connected with the carrying out of the campaign, made no\r\nattempt to gain any influence over the general course of political\r\nevents, which agrees completely with the service idea of a national\r\narmy. But, at the same time, the Stavka distinctly avoided influencing\r\nthe public spirit of the country so as to lead this powerful factor to\r\nmoral co-operation in the struggle. There was no connection with the\r\nleading organs of the Press, which was represented at the Stavka by men\r\npossessing neither weight nor influence.\r\n\r\nWhen the thunderstorm of the Revolution broke and the political\r\nwhirlwind swept up and convulsed the Army, the Stavka could remain\r\ninert no longer. It had to respond. The more so, that suddenly no\r\nsource of moral power was to be found in Russia which might have\r\nprotected the Army. The Government, especially the War Office, rushed\r\nirresistibly down the path of opportunism; the Soviets and the\r\nSocialist Press undermined the Army; the Bourgeois Press now cried\r\n\"videant consules ne quid Imperio detrimenti caparet,\" now naïvely\r\nrejoiced at the \"democratisation and liberation\" which were taking\r\nplace. Even in what might have been considered the competent spheres\r\nof the higher military bureaucracy of Petrograd there reigned such a\r\nvariety of views, as plunged the public opinion of the country into\r\nperplexity and bewilderment.\r\n\r\nIt turned out, however, that for the conflict the Stavka possessed\r\nneither organisation nor men, neither technique nor knowledge and\r\nexperience. And, worst of all, the Stavka was in some way or other\r\nshoved and thrown aside by the madly-careering chariot of life. Its\r\nvoice grew weaker and sank into silence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Old Army: a review. General Ivanov.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Revolutionary Army: a review. Kerensky.]\r\n\r\nThe second Quartermaster-General--General Markov--had a serious task\r\nbefore him--he had to create the necessary apparatus, to establish\r\ncommunications with the important papers, to supply the Stavka with\r\na \"megaphone\" and raise the condition of the Army Press, which was\r\nleading a wretched existence and which the army organisations were\r\ntrying to destroy. Markov took up the task warmly, but failed to do\r\nanything serious, as he only remained in office two months. Every step\r\nof the Stavka in this direction called forth from the Revolutionary\r\nDemocracy a disingenuous accusation of counter-revolutionary action.\r\nAnd Liberal Bourgeois Moscow, to which he turned for aid, in the form\r\nof intellectual and technical assistance in his task, replied with\r\neloquent promises, but did absolutely nothing.\r\n\r\nThus the Stavka had no means at all, not only for actively combating\r\nthe disintegration of the Army, but for resisting German propaganda,\r\nwhich was spreading rapidly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLudendorff says frankly and with a national egotism rising to a high\r\ndegree of cynicism: \"I did not doubt that the _débâcle_ of the Russian\r\nArmy and the Russian people was fraught with great danger for Germany\r\nand Austria-Hungary.... _In sending Lenin to Russia_ our Government\r\nassumed an enormous responsibility! This journey was justified from a\r\nmilitary point of view; _it was necessary that Russia should fall_. But\r\nour Government should have taken measures that this should not happen\r\nto Germany.\"[21]\r\n\r\nEven now the boundless sufferings of the Russian people, now \"out of\r\nthe ranks,\" did not call forth a single word of pity or regret from its\r\nmoral corrupters....\r\n\r\nWith the beginning of the campaign, the Germans altered the direction\r\nof their work with respect to Russia. Without breaking their\r\nconnections with the well-known reactionary circles at Court, in the\r\nGovernment and in the Duma, using all means for influencing these\r\ncircles and all their motives--greed, ambition, German atavism, and\r\nsometimes a peculiar understanding of patriotism--the Germans entered\r\nat the same time into close fellowship with the Russian Revolutionaries\r\nin the country, and especially abroad, amongst the multitudinous\r\nemigrant colony. Directly or indirectly, all were drawn into the\r\nservice of the German Government--great agents in the sphere of spying\r\nand recruiting, like Parvus (Helfand); provocateurs, connected with the\r\nRussian Secret Police, like Blum; propaganda agents--Oulianoff (Lenin),\r\nBronstein (Trotsky), Apfelbaum (Zinovieff), Lunacharsky, Ozolin, Katz\r\n(Kamkoff), and many others. And in their wake went a whole group of\r\nshallow or unscrupulous people, cast over the frontier and fanatically\r\nhating the _régime_ which had rejected them--hating it to the degree\r\nof forgetfulness of their native land, or squaring accounts with this\r\n_régime_, acting sometimes as blind tools in the hands of the German\r\nGeneral Staff. What their motives were, what their pay, how far they\r\nwent--these are details; what is important is that they sold Russia,\r\nserving those aims which were set before them by our foe. They were all\r\nclosely interlaced with one another and with the agents of the German\r\nSecret Service, forming with them one unbroken conspiracy.\r\n\r\nThe work began with a widespread Revolutionary and Separatist\r\n(Ukrainian) propaganda among the prisoners of war. According to\r\nLiebknecht, \"the German Government not only helped this propaganda,\r\nbut carried it on itself.\" These aims were served by the Committee\r\nof Revolutionary Propaganda, founded in 1915 at The Hague by the\r\nUnion for the Liberation of the Ukraine in Austria by the Copenhagen\r\nInstitute (Parvus's organisation), and a whole series of papers of a\r\nRevolutionary and Defeatist character, partly published at the expense\r\nof the German Staff, partly subsidised by it--the _Social Democrat_\r\n(Geneva--Lenin's paper), _Nashe Slovo_ (Paris--Trotsky's paper), _Na\r\nTchoozhbeenie_ (Geneva--contributions from Tchernoff, Katz and others),\r\n_Russkii Viestnik_, _Rodnaya Retch_, _Nedielia_, and so forth. Similar\r\nto this was the activity--the spread of Defeatist and Revolutionary\r\nliterature, side by side with purely charitable work--of the Committee\r\nof Intellectual Aid to Russian Prisoners of War in Germany and Austria\r\n(Geneva), which was in connection with official Moscow and received\r\nsubsidies from it.\r\n\r\nTo define the character of these publications it is enough to quote\r\ntwo or three phrases expressing the views of their inspirers. Lenin\r\nsaid in the _Social Democrat_: \"The least evil will be the defeat\r\nof the Czarist monarchy, the most barbarous and reactionary of all\r\nGovernments.\" Tchernoff, the future Minister of Agriculture, declared\r\nin the _Mysl_ that he had one Fatherland only--the International!\r\n\r\nAlong with literature the Germans invited Lenin's and Tchernoff's\r\ncollaborators, especially from the editorial staff of _Na\r\nTchoozhbeenie_, to lecture in the camps, while a German spy, Consul Von\r\nPelche, carried on a large campaign for the recruiting of agitators for\r\npropaganda in the ranks of the Army--among the Russian emigrants of\r\nconscript age and of Left Wing politics.\r\n\r\nAll this was but preparatory work. The Russian Revolution opened\r\nboundless vistas for German propaganda. Along with honest people, once\r\npersecuted, who had struggled for the good of the people, there rushed\r\ninto Russia all that revolutionary riff-raff which absorbed the members\r\nof the Russian secret police, the international informers and the\r\nrebels.\r\n\r\nThe Petrograd authorities feared most of all the accusation of want of\r\nDemocratic spirit. Miliukov, as Minister, stated repeatedly that \"the\r\nGovernment considers unconditionally possible the return to Russia of\r\nall emigrants, regardless of their views on the War and independently\r\nof their registration in the International Control List.\"[22] This\r\nMinister carried on a dispute with the British, demanding the release\r\nof the Bolsheviks, Bronstein (Trotsky), Zourabov and others, who had\r\nbeen arrested by the British.\r\n\r\nMatters were more complicated in the case of Lenin and his supporters.\r\nDespite the demands of the Russian Government, the Allies would\r\nundoubtedly have refused to let them through. Therefore, as Ludendorff\r\nacknowledges, the German Government despatched Lenin and his companions\r\n(the first group consisted of seventeen persons) to Russia, allowing\r\nthem free transit through Germany. This undertaking, which promised\r\nextraordinarily important results, was richly financed with gold and\r\ncredit through the Stockholm (Ganetsky-Fuerstenberg) and Copenhagen\r\n(Parvus) centres and through the Russian Siberian Bank. That gold\r\nwhich, as Lenin expressed it, \"does not smell.\"\r\n\r\nIn October, 1917, Bourtsev published a list of 159 persons brought\r\nthrough Germany to Russia by order of the German General Staff. Nearly\r\nall of them, according to Bourtsev, \"were revolutionaries who, during\r\nthe War, had carried on a defeatist campaign in Switzerland and were\r\nnow William's voluntary or involuntary agents.\" Many of them at once\r\nassumed a prominent position in the Social Democratic party, in the\r\nSoviet, the Committee[23] and the Bolshevik Press. The names of Lenin,\r\nTsederbaum (Martov), Lunacharsky, Natanson, Riazanov, Apfelbaum\r\n(Zinoviev) and others soon became the most fateful in Russian history.\r\n\r\nOn the day of Lenin's arrival in Petrograd the German paper _Die Woche_\r\ndevoted an article to this event, in which he was called \"a true\r\nfriend of the Russian people and an honourable antagonist.\" And the\r\nCadet semi-official organ, the _Retch_, which afterwards boldly and\r\nunwaveringly waged war against the Lenin party, greeted his arrival\r\nwith the words: \"Such a generally acknowledged leader of the Socialist\r\nparty ought now to be in the arena, and his arrival in Russia, whatever\r\nopinion may be held of his views, should be welcomed.\"\r\n\r\nOn April 3rd Lenin arrived in Petrograd, where he was received with\r\nmuch state, and in a few days declared his theses, part of which formed\r\nthe fundamental themes of German propaganda: \"Down with war and all\r\npower to the Soviet!\"\r\n\r\nLenin's first actions seemed so absurd and so clearly anarchistic that\r\nthey called forth protests not only in the whole of the Liberal Press,\r\nbut also in the greater part of the Socialist Press.\r\n\r\nBut, little by little, the Left Wing of the Revolutionary Democracy,\r\nreinforced by German agents, joined overtly and openly in the\r\npropaganda of its chief, without meeting any decisive rebuff either\r\nfrom the double-minded Soviet or the feeble Government. The great wave\r\nof German and mutinous propaganda engulfed more and more the Soviet,\r\nthe Committee, the Revolutionary Press, and the ignorant masses, and\r\nwas reflected, consciously or unconsciously, even among those who stood\r\nat the helm of the State.\r\n\r\nFrom the very first Lenin's organisation, as was said afterwards, in\r\nJuly, in the report of the Procurator of the Petrograd High Court of\r\nJustice, \"aiming at assisting the States warring against Russia in\r\ntheir hostile actions against her, entered into an agreement with the\r\nagents of the said States to forward the disorganisation of the Russian\r\nArmy and the Russian rear, for which purpose it used the financial\r\nmeans received from these States to organise a propaganda among the\r\npopulation and the troops ... and also, for the same purpose, organised\r\nin Petrograd, from July 3rd to 5th, an armed insurrection against the\r\nSupreme Power existing in the State.\"\r\n\r\nThe Stavka had long and vainly raised its voice of warning. General\r\nAlexeiev had, both personally and in writing, called on the Government\r\nto take measures against the Bolsheviks and the spies. Several times\r\nI myself applied to the War Office, sending in, among other things,\r\nevidential material concerning Rakovsky's spying and documents\r\ncertifying the treason of Lenin, Skoropis-Yoltoukhovsky and others.\r\nThe part played by the Union for the Liberation of the Ukraine (of\r\nwhich, besides others, Melenevsky and V. Doroshenko were members)[24]\r\nas an organisation of the Central Powers for propaganda, spying and\r\nrecruiting for \"Setch Ukraine units,\" was beyond all doubt. In one of\r\nmy letters (May 16th), based on the examination of a Russian officer,\r\nYermolenko, who had been a prisoner of war and had accepted the part\r\nof a German agent for the purpose of disclosing the organisation,\r\nthe following picture was revealed: \"Yermolenko was transferred to\r\nour rear, on the front of the Sixth Army, to agitate for a speedy\r\nconclusion of a separate peace with Germany. Yermolenko accepted this\r\ncommission at the insistence of his comrades. Two officers of the\r\nGerman General Staff, Schiditzky and Lubar, informed him that a similar\r\nagitation was being carried on in Russia by the sectional president of\r\nthe Union for the Liberation of the Ukraine, A. Skoropis-Yoltoukhovsky,\r\nand by Lenin, as agents of the German General Staff. Lenin had been\r\ninstructed to seek to undermine by all means the confidence of the\r\nRussian people in the Provisional Government. The money for this work\r\nwas received through one Svendson, an employee of the German Embassy in\r\nStockholm. These methods were practised before the Revolution also. Our\r\ncommand turned its attention to the somewhat too frequent appearance\r\nof \"escaped prisoners.\" Many of them having surrendered to the enemy,\r\npassed through a definite course of intelligence work, and having\r\nreceived substantial pay and \"papers,\" were permitted to pass over to\r\nus through the line of trenches.\r\n\r\nBeing altogether unable to decide what was a case of courage and what\r\nof treachery, we nearly always sent all escaped prisoners from the\r\nEuropean to the Caucasian Front.\r\n\r\nAll the representations of the High Command as to the insufferable\r\nsituation of the Army, in the face of such vast treachery, remained\r\nwithout result. Kerensky carried on free debates in the Soviet with\r\nLenin on the subject whether the country and the Army should be broken\r\ndown or not, basing his action on the view that he was the \"War\r\nMinister of the Revolution,\" and that \"freedom of opinion was sacred to\r\nhim, whencesoever it might proceed.\" Tzeretelli warmly defended Lenin:\r\n\"I do not agree with Lenin and his agitation. But what has been said by\r\nDeputy Shulgin is a slander against Lenin, _Never has Lenin called for\r\nactions which would infringe upon the course of the Revolution. Lenin\r\nis carrying on an idealist propaganda._\"\r\n\r\nThis much-talked-of freedom of opinion extremely simplified the work\r\nof German propaganda, giving rise to such an unheard-of phenomenon as\r\nthe open preaching in German, at public meetings and in Kronstadt,\r\nof a separate peace and of distrust of the Government, by an agent\r\nof Germany, the President of the Zimmerwald and Kienthal Conference,\r\nRobert Grimm!...\r\n\r\nWhat a state of moral prostration and loss of all national dignity,\r\nconsciousness, and patriotism is presented by the picture of Tzeretelli\r\nand Skobelev \"vouching\" for the _agent provocateur_; of Kerensky\r\nimportuning the Government to grant Grimm the right of entry into\r\nRussia; of Tereshtchenko permitting it, and of Russians listening to\r\nGrimm's speeches--without indignation, without resentment.\r\n\r\nDuring the Bolshevik insurrection of July the officials of the Ministry\r\nof Justice, exasperated by the laxity of the leaders of the Government,\r\ndecided, with the knowledge of their Minister, Pereverzev, to publish\r\nmy letter to the Minister of War and other documents, exposing Lenin's\r\ntreason to his country. The documents being a statement signed by two\r\nSocialists, Alexinsky and Pankratov, were given to the printers. The\r\npremature disclosure of this fact called forth a passionate protest\r\nfrom Tchkheidze and Tzeretelli, and terrible anger on the part of the\r\nMinisters Nekrassov and Tereshtchenko. The Government forbade the\r\npublication of information which sullied the good name of comrade\r\nLenin, and had recourse to reprisals against the officials of the\r\nMinistry of Justice. However, the statement appeared in the Press.\r\nIn its turn the Executive Committee of the Soviet of Workmen's and\r\nSoldiers' Delegates exhibited a touching care, not only for the\r\ninviolability of the Bolsheviks, but even for their honour, by issuing\r\non July 5th a special appeal calling on people \"to refrain from the\r\nspreading of accusations reflecting dishonour\" on Lenin and \"other\r\npolitical workers\" pending the investigation of the matter by a special\r\ncommission. This consideration was openly expressed in a resolution\r\npassed by the Central Executive Committees (on July 8th), which,\r\nwhile condemning the attempt of the Anarchist-Bolshevist elements to\r\noverthrow the Government, expressed the fear that the \"inevitable\"\r\nmeasures to which the Government and the military authorities must\r\nhave recourse ... would create a basis for the demagogic agitation of\r\nthe counter-Revolutionaries who, for the time being, gathered round\r\nthe flag of the Revolutionary régime, but who might pave the way for a\r\nmilitary Dictatorship.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, the exposure of the direct criminal participation of the\r\nleaders of Bolshevism in acts of mutiny and treason may have obliged\r\nthe Government to begin repressions. Lenin and Apfelbaum (Zinoviev)\r\nescaped to Finland, while Bronstein (Trotsky), Kozlovsky, Raskolnikov,\r\nRemniov, and many others were arrested. Several Anarchist-Bolshevist\r\nnewspapers were suspended.\r\n\r\nThese repressions, however, were not of a serious character. Many\r\npersons known to have been leaders in the mutiny were not charged at\r\nall, and their work of destruction was continued with consistency and\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile carrying the war into our country the Germans persistently\r\nand methodically put into practice another watchword--peace at the\r\nFront. Fraternisation had taken place earlier as well, before the\r\nRevolution; but it was then due to the hopelessly wearisome life in the\r\ntrenches, to curiosity, to a simple feeling of humanity even towards\r\nthe enemy--a feeling exhibited by the Russian soldier more than once\r\non the battlefield of Borodino, in the bastions of Sevastopol, and in\r\nthe Balkan mountains. Fraternisation took place rarely, was punished\r\nby the commanders, and had no dangerous tendencies in it. But now the\r\nGerman General Staff organised it on a large scale, systematically\r\nand along the whole Front, with the participation of the higher Staff\r\norgans and the commanders, with a detailed code of instructions, which\r\nincluded the observation of our forces and positions, the demonstration\r\nof the impressive armament and strength of their own positions,\r\npersuasion as to the aimlessness of the War, the incitement of the\r\nRussian soldiers against the Government and their commanders, in whose\r\ninterest exclusively this \"sanguinary slaughter\" was being continued.\r\nMasses of the Defeatist literature manufactured in Germany were passed\r\nover into our trenches, and at the same time agents of the Soviet and\r\nthe Committee travelled quite freely along the Front with similar\r\npropaganda, with the organisation of \"exhibition fraternisation,\" and\r\nwith whole piles of _Pravda_, _Trench Pravda_, _Social Democrat_, and\r\nother products of our native Socialist intellect and conscience--organs\r\nwhich, in their forceful argumentation, left the Jesuitical eloquence\r\nof their German brethren far behind. At the same time a general\r\nmeeting of simple \"delegates from the Front\" in Petrograd was passing\r\na resolution in favour of allowing fraternisation for the purpose of\r\nrevolutionary propaganda among the enemy's ranks!\r\n\r\nOne cannot read without deep emotion of the feelings of Kornilov,\r\nwho, for the first time after the Revolution, in the beginning of\r\nMay, when in command of the Eighth Army, came into contact with this\r\nfatal phenomenon in the life of our Front. They were written down by\r\nNezhintsev, at that time captain of the General Staff and later the\r\ngallant commander of the Kornilov Regiment, who in 1918 fell in action\r\nagainst the Bolsheviks at the storm of Ekaterinodar.\r\n\r\n\"When we had got well into the firing zone of the position,\" writes\r\nNezhintsev, \"the General (Kornilov) looked very gloomy. His words,\r\n'disgrace, treason,' showed his estimate of the dead silence of the\r\nposition. Then he remarked:\r\n\r\n\"'Do you feel all the nightmare horror of this silence? You understand\r\nthat we are watched by the enemy artillery observers and that we are\r\nnot fired at. Yes, the enemy are mocking us as weaklings. Can it be\r\nthat the Russian soldier is capable of informing the enemy of my\r\narrival at the position?'\r\n\r\n\"I was silent, but the sacred tears in the eyes of this hero touched me\r\ndeeply, and at this moment I vowed in my mind that I would die for him\r\nand for our common Motherland. General Kornilov seemed to feel this. He\r\nturned to me suddenly, pressed my hand, and turned away, as if ashamed\r\nof his momentary weakness.\r\n\r\n\"The acquaintance of the new Commander with the infantry began with\r\nthe units in the Reserve, when formed in rank, holding a meeting and\r\nreplying to all appeals for the necessity of an advance by pointing\r\nout how useless it was to continue a Bourgeois war, carried on by\r\n'militarists.' When, after two hours of fruitless discussion, General\r\nKornilov, worn out morally and physically, proceeded to the trenches,\r\nhe found a scene there which could scarcely have been foreseen by any\r\nsoldier of this age.\r\n\r\n\"We entered into a system of fortifications where the trench-lines\r\nof both sides were separated or, more correctly, joined by lines of\r\nbarbed wire.... The appearance of General Kornilov was greeted ... by\r\na group of German officers, who gazed insolently on the Commander of\r\nthe Russian Army; behind them stood some Prussian soldiers. The General\r\ntook my field-glasses and, ascending the parapet, began to examine the\r\narena of the fights to come. When someone expressed a fear that the\r\nPrussians might shoot the Russian Commander, the latter replied:\r\n\r\n\"'I would be immensely glad if they did; perhaps it might sober our\r\nbefogged soldiers and put an end to this shameful fraternisation.'\r\n\r\n\"At the positions of a neighbouring regiment the Commander of the Army\r\nwas greeted by the _bravura_ march of a German Jaeger regiment, to\r\nwhose band our 'fraternising' soldiers were making their way. With the\r\nremark, 'This is treason!' the General turned to an officer standing\r\nnext him, ordering the fraternisers from both sides to be told that if\r\nthis disgraceful scene did not cease at once he would turn the guns\r\nloose on them. The disciplined Germans ceased playing and returned to\r\ntheir own trenches, seemingly ashamed of the abominable spectacle.\r\nBut our soldiers--oh! they held meetings for a long time, complaining\r\nof the way their 'counter-Revolutionary commanders oppressed their\r\nliberty.'\"\r\n\r\nIn general I do not cherish feelings of revenge. Yet I regret\r\nexceedingly that General Ludendorff left the German Army prematurely,\r\nbefore its break-up, and did not experience directly in its ranks those\r\ninexpressibly painful moral torments which we Russian officers have\r\nsuffered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Before the battle in the Revolutionary Army: a meeting.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Types of men in the Revolutionary Army.]\r\n\r\nBesides fraternisation, the enemy High Command practised, on an\r\nextensive scale and with provocatory purpose, the dispatch of flags\r\nof truce directly to the troops, or rather to the soldiers. Thus,\r\nabout the end of April on the Dvinsk Front there came with a flag of\r\ntruce a German officer, who was not received. He managed, however, to\r\naddress to the crowd of soldiers the words: \"I have come to you with\r\noffers of peace, and am empowered to speak even with the Provisional\r\nGovernment, but your commanders do not wish for peace.\" These words\r\nwere spread rapidly, and caused agitation among the soldiers and\r\neven threats to desert the Front. Therefore when, a few days later,\r\nin the same section, _parliamentaires_ (a brigade commander, two\r\nofficers, and a bugler) made their appearance again, they were taken\r\nto the Staff quarters of the Fifth Army. It turned out, of course,\r\nthat they had no authorisations, and could not even state more or\r\nless definitely the object of their coming, since \"the sole object of\r\nthe pseudo-_parliamentaires_ appearing on our Front,\" says an order\r\nof the Commander-in-Chief, \"has been to observe our dispositions and\r\nour spirit, and, by a lying exhibition of their pacific feelings, to\r\nincline our troops to an inaction profitable to the Germans and ruinous\r\nto Russia and her freedom.\" Similar cases occurred on the Fronts of\r\nthe Eighth, Ninth, and other Armies.\r\n\r\nIt is characteristic that the Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern German\r\nFront, Prince Leopold of Bavaria, found it possible to take a personal\r\npart in this course of provocation. In two radiograms, bearing the\r\nsystematic character of the customary proclamations and intended for\r\nthe soldiers and the Soviet, he stated that the High Command was ready\r\nto meet half-way \"the repeatedly expressed desire of the Russian\r\nSoldiers' Delegates to put an end to bloodshed\"; that \"military\r\noperations between us (the Central Powers) and Russia could be put an\r\nend to _without Russia breaking with her Allies_\"; that \"if Russia\r\nwants to know the particulars of our conditions, let her give up her\r\ndemand for their publication....\" And he finishes with a threat: \"Does\r\nthe new Russian Government, instigated by its Allies, wish to satisfy\r\nitself whether divisions of heavy guns are still to be found on our\r\nEastern Front?\"\r\n\r\nEarlier, when leaders did discreditable things to save their armies and\r\ntheir countries, at least they were ashamed of it and kept silence.\r\nNowadays military traditions have undergone a radical change.\r\n\r\nTo the credit of the Soviet it must be said that it took a proper\r\nview of this provocationary invitation, saying in reply: \"The\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the German troops on the Eastern Front offers us\r\n'a separate truce and secrecy of negotiations.' But Russia knows that\r\nthe _débâcle_ of the Allies will be the beginning of the _débâcle_ of\r\nher own Army, and the _débâcle_ of the Revolutionary troops of Free\r\nRussia would mean not only new common graves, but the failure of the\r\nRevolution, the fall of Free Russia.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the very first days of the Revolution a marked change naturally\r\ntook place in the attitude of the Russian Press. It expressed itself on\r\nthe one hand in a certain differentiation of all the Bourgeois organs,\r\nwhich assumed a Liberal-Conservative character, the _tactics_ of which\r\nwere adopted by an inconsiderable part of the Socialist Press, of the\r\ntype of Plekhanov's _Yedinstvo_; and on the other in the appearance of\r\nan immense number of Socialist organs.\r\n\r\nThe organs of the Right Wing underwent a considerable evolution, a\r\ncharacteristic indication of which was the unexpected declaration of\r\na well-known member of the _Novoye Vremya_ staff, Mr. Menshikov: \"We\r\nmust be grateful to destiny that the Monarchy, which for a thousand\r\nyears has betrayed the people, has at last betrayed itself and put a\r\ncross on its own grave. To dig it up from under that cross and start a\r\ngreat dispute about the candidates for the fallen throne would be, in\r\nmy opinion, a fatal mistake.\" In the course of the first few months the\r\nRight Press partly closed down--not without pressure and violence on\r\nthe part of the Soviets--partly it assumed a pacific-Liberal attitude.\r\nIt was only in September, 1917, that its tone grew extremely violent in\r\nconnection with the final exposure of the weakness of the Government,\r\nthe loss of all hope of a legal way out of the \"no thoroughfare\" which\r\nhad arisen, and the echoes of Kornilov's venture. The attacks of the\r\nextremist organs on the Government passed into solid abuse of it.\r\n\r\nThough differing in a greater or lesser degree in its understanding of\r\nthe social problems which the Revolution had to solve, though guilty,\r\nperhaps, along with Russian society, of many mistakes, yet the Russian\r\nLiberal Press showed an exceptional unanimity in the more important\r\nquestions of a constitutional and national character: full power to\r\nthe Provisional Government, Democratic reforms in the spirit of the\r\nprogramme of March 2nd,[25] war until victory along with the Allies,\r\nan All-Russia Constituent Assembly as the source of the supreme power\r\nand of the constitution of the country. In yet another respect has the\r\nLiberal Press left a good reputation behind it in history: in the days\r\nof lofty popular enthusiasm, as in the days of doubt, vacillation and\r\ngeneral demoralisation, which distinguished the Revolutionary period of\r\n1917, no place was found in it, nor in the Right Press either, for the\r\ndistribution of German gold....\r\n\r\nThe appearance, on a large scale, of the new Socialist Press was\r\naccompanied by a series of unfavourable circumstances. It had no\r\nnormal past, no traditions. Its prolonged life below the surface, the\r\nexclusively destructive method of action adopted by it, its suspicious\r\nand hostile attitude towards all authority, put a certain stamp on the\r\nwhole tendency of this Press, leaving too little place and attention\r\nfor creative work. The complete discord in thought, the contradictions\r\nand vacillation which reigned both within the Soviet and also among the\r\nparty groups and within the parties, were reflected in the Press, just\r\nas much as the elemental pressure from below of irresistible, narrowly\r\negotistic class demands; for neglect of these demands gave rise to\r\nthe threat, which was once expressed by the \"beauty and pride of the\r\nRevolution,\" the Kronstadt sailors to Tchernov, the Minister: \"If you\r\nwill not give us anything, Michael Alexandrovitch will.\" Finally, the\r\nPress was not uninfluenced by the appearance in it of a number of such\r\npersons as brought into it an atmosphere of uncleanness and perfidy.\r\nThe papers were full of names, which had emerged from the sphere of\r\ncrime, of the Secret Police and of international espionage. All these\r\ngentlemen--Tchernomazov (a provocator in the Secret Police and director\r\nof the pre-Revolutionary _Pravda_), Berthold (the same and also\r\neditor of the _Communist_), Dekonsky, Malinovsky, Matislavsky, those\r\ncolleagues of Lenin and Gorky--Nahamkes, Stoutchka, Ouritsky, Gimmer\r\n(Soukhanov), and a vast number of equally notorious names--brought the\r\nRussian Press to a hitherto unknown degree of moral degradation.\r\n\r\nThe difference was only a matter of scope. Some papers, akin to\r\nthe Soviet semi-official organ, the _Izvestia of the Workmen's and\r\nSoldiers' Delegates_, undermined the country and the Army, while others\r\nof the _Pravda_ type (the organ of the Bolshevik Social Democrats)\r\nbroke them down.\r\n\r\nAt the same time as the _Izvestia_ would call on its readers to\r\nsupport the Provisional Government, while secretly ready to strike\r\na blow at it, the _Pravda_ would declare that \"the Government is\r\ncounter-Revolutionary, and therefore there can be no relations\r\nwith it. The task of the Revolutionary Democracy is to attain to\r\nthe dictatorship of the proletariat.\" And Tchernov's Socialist\r\nRevolutionary organ, the _Delo Naroda_, would discover a neutral\r\nformula: all possible support to the Coalition Government, but \"there\r\nis not, and cannot be, any unanimity in this question; more than that,\r\nthere must not be, in the interests of the double defence.\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time as the _Izvestia_ began to preach an advance, but\r\nwithout a final victory, not abandoning, however, the intention of\r\n\"deciding over the heads of the Government and the ruling classes the\r\nconditions on which the War might be stopped,\" the _Pravda_ called for\r\nuniversal fraternisation, and the Socialist Revolutionary, _Zemlia i\r\nVolia_, alternately grieved that Germany still wished for conquest,\r\nor demanded a separate peace. Tchernov's paper, which in March had\r\nconsidered that, \"should the enemy be victorious, there would be an end\r\nto Russian freedom,\" now, in May, saw in the preaching of an advance\r\n\"the limit of unblushing gambling on the fate of the Fatherland, the\r\nlimit of irresponsibility and demagogy.\" Gorky's paper, _Novaya Zhizn_,\r\nspeaking through Gimmer (Soukhanov), rises to cynicism when it says:\r\n\"When Kerensky gives orders for _Russian soil to be cleared of enemy\r\ntroops_, his demands far exceed the limits of military _technique_.\r\nHe calls for a political act, one which has never been provided for\r\nby the Coalition Government. For clearing the country by an advance\r\nsignifies 'complete victory'....\" Altogether the _Novaya Zhizn_\r\nsupported German interests with especial warmth, raising its voice in\r\nall cases when German interests were threatened with danger, either\r\non the part of the Allies or on ours. And when the advance of the\r\ndisorganised Army ended in failure--in Tarnopol and Kalush--when Riga\r\nhad fallen, the Left Press started a bitter campaign against the Stavka\r\nand the commanding personnel, and Tchernov's paper, in connection\r\nwith the proposed reforms in the Army, cried hysterically: \"Let the\r\nproletarians know that it is proposed again to give them up to the\r\niron embrace of beggary, slavery and hunger.... Let the soldiers know\r\nthat it is proposed again to enslave them with the 'discipline' of\r\ntheir commanders and to force them to shed their blood without end, so\r\nlong as the belief of the Allies in Russia's 'gallantry' is restored.\"\r\nThe most straightforward of all, however, was afterwards the _Iskra_,\r\nthe organ of the Menshevist Internationalists (Martov-Zederbaum),\r\nwhich, on the day of the occupation of the island of Oesel by a German\r\nlanding-party, published an article entitled \"Welcome to the German\r\nFleet!\"\r\n\r\nThe Army had its own military Press. The organs of the Army staffs and\r\nof those at the Front, which used to appear before the Revolution,\r\nwere of the nature of purely military bulletins. Beginning with the\r\nRevolution, these organs, with their weak literary forces, began to\r\nfight for the existence of the Army, conscientiously, honestly, but\r\nnot cleverly. Meeting with indifference or exasperation on the part of\r\nthe soldiers, who had already turned their backs on the officers, and\r\nespecially on the part of the Committee organs of the \"Revolutionary\"\r\nmovement, which existed side by side with them, they began to weaken\r\nand die out, until at last, in the days of August, an order from\r\nKerensky closed them altogether; the exclusive right of publishing Army\r\nnewspapers was transferred to the Army Committee and the Committees of\r\nthe troops at the Front. The same fate befell the _News of the Active\r\nArmy_, the Stavka organ, started by General Markov and left without\r\nsupport from the weighty powers of the Press of the capital.\r\n\r\nThe Committee Press, widely spread among the troops at the expense of\r\nthe Government, reflected those moods of which I have spoken earlier\r\nin the chapter on the Committees, ranging from Constitutionalism to\r\nAnarchism, from complete victory to an immediate conclusion of peace,\r\nwithout orders. It reflected--but in a worse, more sorry form, as\r\nregards literary style and content--that disharmony of thought and\r\nthose tendencies towards extreme theories which characterised the\r\nSocialist Press of the Capital. In this respect, in accordance with the\r\npersonnel of the Committees, and to some extent with their proximity to\r\nPetrograd, the respective Fronts differed somewhat from one another.\r\nThe most moderate was the South-Western Front, somewhat worse, the\r\nWestern, while the Northern Front was pronouncedly Bolshevist. Besides\r\nlocal talent, the columns of the Committee Press were in many cases\r\nopened wide to the resolutions not only of the extreme national\r\nparties, but even of the German parties.\r\n\r\nIt would be incorrect, however, to speak of the immediate action of the\r\nPress on the masses of the soldiers. It did not exist any more than\r\nthere were any popular newspapers which these masses could understand.\r\nThe Press exercised an influence principally on the semi-educated\r\nelements in the ranks of the Army. This sphere turned out to be nearer\r\nto the soldiers, and to it passed a certain share of that authority\r\nwhich was enjoyed earlier by the officers. Ideas gathered from the\r\npapers and refracted through the mental prism of this class passed\r\nin a simplified form to the soldiery, the vast majority of which\r\nunfortunately consisted of ignorant and illiterate men. And among these\r\nmasses all these conceptions, stripped of cunningly-woven arguments,\r\npremises and grounds, were transformed into wondrously simple and\r\nterrifically logical conclusions.\r\n\r\nIn them dominated the straightforward negation: \"Down!\"\r\n\r\nDown with the Bourgeois Government, down with the counter-Revolutionary\r\nCommanders, down with the \"sanguinary slaughter,\" down with everything\r\nof which they were sick, of which they were wearied, all that in one\r\nway or another interfered with their animal instincts and hampered\r\n\"free will\"--down with them all!\r\n\r\nIn such an elementary fashion did the Army at innumerable soldiers'\r\nmeetings settle all the political and social questions that were\r\nagitating mankind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe curtain has fallen. The Treaty of Versailles has for a time given\r\npause to the armed conflict in Central Europe. Evident to the end that,\r\nhaving regained their strength, the nations may again take up their\r\narms, so as to burst the chains in which defeat has fettered them.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the \"world-peace,\" which the Christian churches have been\r\npreaching for twenty centuries, is buried for years to come.\r\n\r\nTo us, how childishly naïve now seem the efforts of the humanists of\r\nthe nineteenth century, who by prolonged, ardent propaganda sought\r\nto soften the horrors of war and to introduce the limiting norms\r\nof International Law! Yes, now, when we know that one may not only\r\ninfringe the neutrality of a peaceful, cultured country, but give it\r\nto be ravaged and plundered; when we can sink peaceable ships, with\r\nwomen and children on board, by means of submarines; poison people with\r\nsuffocating gases and tear their bodies with the fragments of explosive\r\nbullets; when a whole country, a whole nation, is quoted by cold,\r\npolitical calculation merely as a \"Barrier\" against the invasion of\r\narmed force and pernicious ideas, and is periodically either helped or\r\nbetrayed in turn.\r\n\r\nBut the most terrible of all weapons ever invented by the mind of man,\r\nthe most shameful of all the methods permitted in the late World War\r\nwas _the poisoning of the soul of a people_!\r\n\r\nGermany assigns the priority of this invention to Great Britain. Let\r\nthem settle this matter between themselves. But I see my native land\r\ncrushed, dying in the dark night of horror and insanity. And I know her\r\ntormentors.\r\n\r\nTwo theses have arisen before mankind in all their grim power and all\r\ntheir shameless nakedness:\r\n\r\n_All is permissible for the advantage of one's country!_\r\n\r\n_All is permissible for the triumph of one's party, one's class!_\r\n\r\nAll, even the moral and physical ruin of an enemy country, even the\r\nbetrayal of one's native land and the making on its living body of\r\n_social experiments_, the failure of which threatens it with paralysis\r\nand death.\r\n\r\nGermany and Lenin unhesitatingly decided these questions in the\r\naffirmative. The world has condemned them; but are all those who speak\r\nof the matter so unanimous and sincere in their condemnation? Have not\r\nthese ideas left somewhat too deep traces in the minds, not so much\r\nperhaps of the popular masses as of their leaders? I, at least, am led\r\nto such a conclusion by all the present soulless world policy of the\r\nGovernments, especially towards Russia, by all the present utterly\r\nselfish tactics of the class organisations.\r\n\r\nThis is terrible.\r\n\r\nI believe that every people has the right to defend its existence,\r\nsword in hand; I know that for many years to come war will be the\r\ncustomary method of settling international disputes, and that methods\r\nof warfare will be both honourable and, alas! dishonourable. But there\r\nis a certain limit, beyond which even baseness ceases to be simply\r\nbaseness and becomes insanity. This limit we have already reached. And\r\nif religion, science, literature, philosophers, humanitarians, teachers\r\nof mankind do not arouse a broad, idealistic movement against the\r\nHottentot morality with which we have been inoculated, the world will\r\nwitness the decline of its civilisation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Before the battle in the Old Army: Prayers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nTHE CONDITION OF THE ARMY AT THE JULY ADVANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving outlined a whole series of conditions which exercised an\r\ninfluence on the life, spirit, and military efficiency of the once\r\nfamous Russian Army, I shall now pass to the sorrowful tale of its fall.\r\n\r\nI was born in the family of an officer of the line, and for twenty-two\r\nyears (including the two years of the Russo-Japanese War) before the\r\nEuropean War served in the ranks of modest line units and in small Army\r\nStaffs. I shared the life, the joys and the sorrows of the officer and\r\nthe soldier, and devoted many pages in the Military Press to their\r\nlife which was my own. From 1914 to 1920, almost without interval, I\r\nstood at the head of the troops and led them into battle on the fields\r\nof White Russia, Volynia, Galicia, in the mountains of Hungary, in\r\nRoumania, and then--then in the bitter internecine war which, with\r\nbloody share, ploughed up our native land.\r\n\r\nI have more grounds and more right to speak of the Army and in the\r\nname of the Army than all those strangers of the Socialist Camp, who,\r\nin their haughty self-conceit, as soon as they touched the Army,\r\nbegan breaking down its foundations, judging its leaders and fighters\r\nand diagnosing its serious disease, who even now, after grievous\r\nexperiments and experiences, have not given up the hope of transforming\r\nthis mighty and terrible weapon of national self-preservation into a\r\nmeans for satisfying party and social appetites. For me, the Army is\r\nnot only an historical, social, national phenomenon, but nearly the\r\nwhole of my life, in which lie many memories, precious and not to be\r\nforgotten, in which all is bound up and interlaced into one general\r\nmass of swiftly passing days of sadness and of joy, in which there are\r\nhundreds of cherished graves, of buried dreams and unextinguishable\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\nThe Army should be approached cautiously, never forgetting that not\r\nonly its historical foundations, but even such details of its life\r\nas may, perhaps, seem strange and absurd, have their meaning and\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\nWhen the Revolution began that old veteran, beloved by both officers\r\nand soldiers, General P. I. Mishtchenko, being unable to put up with\r\nthe new régime, retired from the Army. He lived at Temir-Han Shoura,\r\nnever went outside his garden fence, and always wore his General's\r\nuniform and his crosses of St. George, even in the days of Bolshevik\r\npower. One day the Bolsheviks came to search his house, and, among\r\nother things, wanted to deprive him of his shoulder straps and\r\ndecorations. The old General retired to a neighbouring room and shot\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nLet whoever will laugh at \"old-fashioned prejudices.\" We shall\r\nreverence his noble memory.\r\n\r\nAnd so the storm-cloud of the Revolution broke.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt whatever that such a cataclysm in the life of the\r\nnation could not but have a grave effect. The Revolution was _bound_\r\nto convulse the Army, greatly weakening and breaking all its historic\r\nties. Such a result was normal, natural and unavoidable, independently\r\nof the condition of the Army at the moment, independently of the mutual\r\nrelations of Commanders and subordinates. We can speak only of the\r\ncircumstances which arrested or hastened the disintegration of the Army.\r\n\r\nA Government appeared.\r\n\r\nIts source might have been one of three elements: The High Command\r\n(a military dictatorship), the Bourgeois State Duma (the Provisional\r\nGovernment), or the Revolutionary Democracy (the Soviet). It was the\r\nProvisional Government that was acknowledged. The attitude of the other\r\ntwo elements towards it was different; the Soviet practically robbed\r\nthe Government of its power, while the High Command submitted to it\r\nimplicitly, and was therefore obliged to carry out its plans.\r\n\r\nThe Government had two courses open to it; it could combat the\r\ndisintegrating influences which began to appear in the Army by stern\r\nand ruthless measures, or it could encourage them. Owing to pressure\r\nfrom the Soviet and partly through want of firmness and through\r\nmisunderstanding of the laws of existence of armed forces, the\r\nGovernment chose the second course.\r\n\r\nThis circumstance decided the fate of the Army. All other circumstances\r\ncould but influence the duration of the process of disruption and its\r\ndepth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Types of soldiers of the Old Army. This company was sent\r\nto the West European Front.]\r\n\r\nThe festive days of touching and joyous union between the officers\r\nand the soldiers vanished rapidly, being replaced by tiresome, weary\r\nweek-days. But they had been in the past, those days of joy, and,\r\ntherefore, no impassable abyss existed between the two Ranks, over\r\nwhich the inexorable logic of life had long been casting a bridge.\r\nThe unnecessary, obsolete methods, which had introduced an element of\r\nirritation into the soldiery, fell away at once, as of themselves; the\r\nofficers became more thoughtful and industrious.\r\n\r\nThen came a torrent of newspapers, appeals, resolutions, orders, from\r\nsome unknown authority, and with them a whole series of new ideas,\r\nwhich the soldier masses were unable to digest and assimilate. New\r\npeople appeared, with a new speech, so fascinating and promising,\r\nliberating the soldiers from obedience and inspiring hope that they\r\nwould be saved from deadly danger immediately. When one Regimental\r\nCommander naïvely inquired whether these people might not be tried\r\nby Field Court-Martial and shot, his telegram, after passing through\r\nall official stages, called forth the reply from Petrograd that these\r\npeople were inviolable, and had been sent by the Soviet to the troops\r\nfor the very purpose of explaining to them the true meaning of current\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nWhen such leaders of the Revolutionary Democracy, as have not yet lost\r\ntheir feeling of responsibility for crucified Russia, now say that the\r\nmovement, caused by the deep class differences between the officers\r\nand the soldiers and by \"the enslavement\" of the latter, was of an\r\nelemental nature, which they could not resist, this is deeply untrue.\r\n\r\nAll the fundamental slogans, all the programmes, tactics, instructions\r\nand text-books, forming the foundation of the \"democratisation\" of\r\nthe Army, had been drawn up by the military sections of the secret\r\nSocialist parties long before the War, outside of \"elemental\" pressure,\r\non the grounds of clear, cold calculation, as a product of \"Socialist\r\nreasoning and conscience.\"\r\n\r\nTrue, the officers strove to persuade the men not to believe the\r\n\"new words\" and to do their duty. But from the very beginning the\r\nSoviets had declared the officers to be foes of the Revolution; in\r\nmany towns they had been subjected to cruel torture and death, and\r\nthis with impunity. Evidently not without some reason, when even the\r\n\"Bourgeois\" Duma issued such a strange and unexpected \"announcement\"\r\nas the following: \"This first day of March, rumours were spread among\r\nthe soldiers of the garrison of Petrograd to the effect that the\r\nofficers in the regiments were disarming the soldiers. These rumours\r\nwere investigated and found to be false. As President of the Military\r\nCommission of the Provisional Committee of the State Duma, I declare\r\nthat the most decided measures _will be_ taken to prevent such action\r\non the part of the officers, up to the shooting of those guilty of it.\r\nSigned, COLONEL ENGELHARDT.\"\r\n\r\nNext came Order No. 1., the Declaration and so forth.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, however, it might have been possible to combat all this verbal\r\nocean of lies and hypocrisy which flowed from Petrograd and from the\r\nlocal Soviets and was echoed by the local demagogues had it not been\r\nfor a circumstance which paralysed all the efforts of the Commanders,\r\nviz., the animal feeling of self-preservation which had flooded the\r\nwhole mass of the soldiers. This feeling had always existed. But it\r\nhad been kept under and restrained by examples of duty fulfilled, by\r\nflashes of national self-consciousness, by shame, fear and pressure.\r\nWhen all these elements had disappeared, when for the soothing of a\r\ndrowsy conscience there was a whole arsenal of new conceptions, which\r\njustified the care for one's own hide and furnished it with an ideal\r\nbasis, then the Army could exist no longer. This feeling upset all the\r\nefforts of the Commanders, all moral principles and the whole regiment\r\nof the Army.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a large, open field, as far as the eye can see, run endless lines of\r\ntrenches, sometimes coming close up to each other, interlacing their\r\nbarbed wire fences, sometimes running far off and vanishing behind a\r\nverdant crest. The sun has risen long ago, but it is still as death\r\nin the field. The first to rise are the Germans. In one place and\r\nanother their figures look out from the trenches; a few come out on to\r\nthe parapet to hang their clothes, damp after the night, in the sun.\r\nA sentry in our front trench opens his sleepy eyes, lazily stretches\r\nhimself, after looking indifferently at the enemy trenches. A soldier\r\nin a dirty shirt, bare-footed, with coat slung over his shoulders,\r\ncringing under the morning cold, comes out of his trench and plods\r\ntowards the German positions, where, between the lines, stands a\r\n\"postbox\"; it contains a new number of the German paper, _The Russian\r\nMessenger_, and proposals for barter.\r\n\r\nAll is still. Not a single gun is to be heard. Last week the Regimental\r\nCommittee issued a resolution against firing, even against distance\r\nfiring; let the necessary distances be estimated by the map. A\r\nLieutenant-Colonel of the gunners--a member of the Committee--gave\r\nhis full approval to this resolution. When yesterday the Commander\r\nof a field battery began firing at a new enemy trench, our infantry\r\nopened rifle fire on our observation post and wounded the telephone\r\noperator. During the night the infantry lit a fire on the position\r\nbeing constructed for a newly arrived heavy battery.[26]\r\n\r\nNine a.m. The first Company gradually begins to awaken. The trenches\r\nare incredibly defiled; in the narrow communication trenches and those\r\nof the second line the air is thick and close. The parapet is crumbling\r\naway. No one troubles to repair it; no one feels inclined to do so,\r\nand there are not enough men in the Company. There is a large number\r\nof deserters; more than fifty have been allowed to go. Old soldiers\r\nhave been demobilised, others have gone on leave with the arbitrary\r\npermission of the Committee. Others, again, have been elected members\r\nof numerous Committees, or gone away as delegates; a while ago, for\r\ninstance, the Division sent a numerous delegation to \"Comrade\" Kerensky\r\nto verify whether he had really given orders for an advance. Finally,\r\nby threats and violence, the soldiers have so terrorised the regimental\r\nsurgeons that the latter have been issuing medical certificates even to\r\nthe \"thoroughly fit.\"\r\n\r\nIn the trenches the hours pass slowly and wearily, in dullness and\r\nidleness. In one corner men are playing cards, in another a soldier\r\nreturned from leave is lazily and listlessly telling a story; the air\r\nis full of obscene swearing. Someone reads aloud from the _Russian\r\nMessenger_ the following:\r\n\r\n\"The English want the Russians to shed the last drop of their blood for\r\nthe greater glory of England, who seeks her profit in everything....\r\nDear soldiers, you must know that Russia would have concluded peace\r\nlong ago had not England prevented her.... We must turn away from\r\nher--the Russian people demand it; such is their sacred will.\"\r\n\r\nSomeone or other swears.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you wish for peace. _They_ make peace, the ----; we shall die\r\nhere, without getting our freedom!\"\r\n\r\nAlong the trenches came Lieutenant Albov, the Company Commander. He\r\nsaid to the groups of soldiers, somewhat irresolutely and entreatingly:\r\n\r\n\"Comrades, get to work quickly. In three days we have not made a single\r\ncommunication trench to the firing line.\"\r\n\r\nThe card players did not even look round; someone said in a low voice,\r\n\"All right.\" The man reading the newspaper rose and reported, in a free\r\nand easy manner:\r\n\r\n\"The Company does not want to dig, because that would be preparation\r\nfor an advance, and the Committee has resolved....\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here, you understand nothing at all about it, and, moreover, why\r\ndo you speak for the whole Company? Even if we remain on the defensive\r\nwe are lost in case of an alarm; the whole Company cannot get out to\r\nthe firing line along a single trench.\"\r\n\r\nHe said this, and with a gesture of despair went on his way. Matters\r\nwere hopeless. Every time he tried to speak with them for a time, and\r\nin a friendly way, they would listen to him attentively; they liked to\r\ntalk to him, and, on the whole, his Company looked on him favourably\r\nin their own way. But he felt that between him and them a wall had\r\nsprung up, against which all his good impulses were shattered. He\r\nhad lost the path to their soul--lost it in the impassable jungle of\r\ndarkness, roughness, and that wave of distrust and suspicion which\r\nhad overwhelmed the soldiers. Was it, perhaps, that he used the wrong\r\nwords, or was not able to say what he meant? Scarcely that. But a\r\nlittle while before the War, when he was a student and was carried away\r\nby the popular movement, he had visited villages and factories and had\r\nfound \"real words\" which were clear and comprehensible to all. But,\r\nmost of all, with what words can one move men to face death when all\r\ntheir feelings are veiled by one feeling--that of self-preservation?\r\n\r\nThe train of his thoughts was broken by the sudden appearance of the\r\nRegimental Commander.\r\n\r\n\"What the devil does this mean? The man on duty does not come forward.\r\nThe men are not dressed. Filth and stench. What are you about,\r\nLieutenant?\"\r\n\r\nThe grey-headed Colonel cast a stern glance on the soldiers which\r\ninvoluntarily impressed them. They all rose to their feet. He glanced\r\nthrough a loop-hole and, starting back, asked nervously:\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\"\r\n\r\nIn the green field, among the barbed wire, a regular bazaar was\r\ngoing on. A group of Germans and of our men were bartering vodka,\r\ntobacco, lard, bread. Some way off a German officer reclined on the\r\ngrass--red-faced, sturdy, with an arrogant look on his face--and\r\ncarried on a conversation with a soldier named Soloveytchick; and,\r\nstrange to say, the familiar and insolent Soloveytchick stood before\r\nthe Lieutenant respectfully.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel pushed the observer aside and, taking his rifle from him,\r\nput it through the loop-hole. A murmur was heard among the soldiers.\r\nThey began to ask him not to shoot. One of them, in a low voice, as if\r\nspeaking to himself, remarked:\r\n\r\n\"This is provocation.\"\r\n\r\nThe Colonel, crimson with fury, turned to him for a moment and shouted:\r\n\r\n\"Silence!\"\r\n\r\nAll grew silent and pressed to the loop-hole. A shot was heard, and the\r\nGerman officer convulsively stretched himself out and was still; blood\r\nwas running from his head. The haggling soldiers scattered.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel threw the rifle down and, muttering through his teeth\r\n\"Scoundrels!\" strode further along the trenches. The \"truce\" was\r\ninfringed.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant went off to his hut. His heart was sad and empty. He was\r\noppressed by the realisation of his unwantedness and uselessness in\r\nthese absurd surroundings, which perverted the whole meaning of that\r\nservice to his country, which alone justified all his grave troubles\r\nand the death which might perhaps be near. He threw himself on his bed,\r\nwhere he lay for an hour, for two hours, striving to think of nothing,\r\nto forget himself.\r\n\r\nBut from beyond the mud wall, where the shelter lay, there crept\r\nsomeone's muffled voice, which seemed to wrap his brain in a filthy fog:\r\n\r\n\"It is all very well for them, the ----. They receive their hundred and\r\nforty roubles a month clear, while we--so generous of them--get seven\r\nand a half. Wait a bit, our turn will come.\"\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\n\"I hear they are sharing the land in our place in the province of\r\nKharkov. If I could only get home.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a knock at the door. The Sergeant-Major had come.\r\n\r\n\"Your honour (so he always addressed his Company Commander in the\r\nabsence of witnesses), the Company is angry, and threatens to leave the\r\nposition if it is not relieved at once. The Second Battalion should\r\nhave relieved us at five o'clock, and it is not here yet. Couldn't they\r\nbe rung up?\"\r\n\r\n\"They will not go away. All right, I shall inquire; but, all the same,\r\nit is too late now. After this morning's incident the Germans will not\r\nallow us to be relieved by day.\"\r\n\r\n\"They will allow us. The Committee members know about it already.\r\nI think\"--he lowered his voice--\"that Soloveytchick has managed to\r\nslip across and explain matters. It is rumoured that the Germans have\r\npromised to overlook it, on condition that next time the Colonel comes\r\nto visit the trenches we should let them know, and they will throw a\r\nbomb. You had better report it or else, who knows?\"\r\n\r\n\"All right.\"\r\n\r\nThe Sergeant-Major was preparing to leave. The Lieutenant stopped him.\r\n\r\n\"Matters are bad, Petrovitch. They do not trust us.\"\r\n\r\n\"God alone knows whom they trust; only last week the Sixth Company\r\nelected their Sergeant-Major themselves, and now they are making a mock\r\nof him; they won't let him say a word.\"\r\n\r\n\"What will things be afterwards?\"\r\n\r\nThe Sergeant-Major blushed, and said softly:\r\n\r\n\"Then the Soloveytchicks will rule over us, and we shall be, so to\r\nspeak, dumb animals before them--that is how matters will be, your\r\nhonour.\"\r\n\r\nThe relief came at last. Captain Bouravin, the Commander of the Fifth\r\nCompany, came into the hut. Albov offered to show him the section and\r\nexplain the disposition of the enemy.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, though that does not matter, because I am not really in\r\ncommand of the Company--I am boycotted.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so. They have elected the 2nd Lieutenant, my subaltern,\r\nas Company Commander, and degraded me as a supporter of the old\r\nrégime, because, you see, I had drill twice a day--you know that the\r\nmarching contingents come up here absolutely untrained. Indeed, the\r\n2nd Lieutenant was the first to vote for my removal. 'We have been\r\nslave-driven long enough,' said he. 'Now we are free. We must clean out\r\neveryone, beginning with the head. A young man can manage the regiment\r\njust as well, so long as he is a true Democrat and supports the freedom\r\nof the soldier.' I would have left, but the Colonel flatly refused to\r\nallow it, and forbids me to hand over the company. So now, you see, we\r\nhave two commanders. I have stood the situation for five days. Look\r\nhere, Albov, you are not in a hurry, are you? Very good, then; let us\r\nhave a chat. I am feeling depressed. Albov, have you not yet thought of\r\nsuicide?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not as yet.\"\r\n\r\nBouravin rose to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Understand me, they have desecrated my soul, outraged my human\r\ndignity, and so every day, every hour, in every word, glance or gesture\r\none sees a constant outrage. What have I done to them? I have been in\r\nthe service for eight years; I have no family, no house or home. All\r\nthis I have found in the regiment, my own regiment. Twice I have been\r\nbadly wounded, and before my wounds were healed have rushed back to the\r\nregiment--so there you are! And I loved the soldier--I am ashamed to\r\nspeak of it myself, but they must remember how, more than once, I have\r\ncrept out under the barbed wire to drag in the wounded. And now! Well,\r\nyes, I reverence the regimental flag and hate their crimson rags. I\r\naccept the Revolution. But to me Russia is infinitely dearer than the\r\nRevolution. All these Committees and meetings, all this adventitious\r\nrubbish which has been sown in the Army I am organically unable to\r\nswallow and digest. But, after all, I interfere with no one; I say\r\nnothing of this to anyone, I strive to convince no one. If only the War\r\ncould be ended honourably, and then I am ready to break stones on the\r\nhighway, only not to remain in an Army democratised in such a manner.\r\nTake my subaltern; he discusses everything with them--nationalisation,\r\nsocialisation, labour control. Now I cannot do so--I never had time\r\nto study it, and I confess I never took any interest in the matter.\r\nYou remember how the Army Commander came here and, amidst a crowd of\r\nsoldiers, said: 'Don't say \"General\"; call me simply Comrade George.'\r\nNow I cannot do such things; besides, all the same, they would not\r\nbelieve me. So I am silent. But they understand and pay me off. And,\r\nyou know, with all their ignorance, what subtle psychologists they\r\nare! They are able to find the place where the sting hurts most. Now,\r\nyesterday for instance....\"\r\n\r\nHe stooped down to Albov's ear, and continued in a whisper:\r\n\r\n\"I returned from our mess. In my tent, at the head of my bed, I have\r\na photograph--well, just a treasured memory. There they had drawn an\r\nobscenity!\"\r\n\r\nBouravin rose and wiped his brow with his handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\"Well, let us take a look at the positions. God willing, we shall not\r\nhave to stand it long. No one in the Company wants to go scouting. I\r\ngo myself every night; sometimes there is a volunteer who accompanies\r\nme--he has a hunter's strain in him. Should anything happen, please,\r\nAlbov, see to it that a little packet--it is in my bag--is sent to its\r\ndestination.\"\r\n\r\nThe company, without waiting for the completion of the relief, wandered\r\naway in disorder. Albov plodded after them.\r\n\r\nThe communication trench ended in a broad hollow. Like a great ant-hill\r\nthe regimental bivouac stretched in rows of huts, tents, smoking\r\ncamp-kitchens and horse-lines. They had once been carefully masked by\r\nartificial plantations, which had now withered, lost their leaves, and\r\nwere merely leafless poles. On an open green soldiers were drilling\r\nhere and there--listlessly, lazily, as if to create an impression\r\nthat they were doing something; after all, it would be awkward to\r\nbe doing absolutely nothing at all. There were few officers about;\r\nthe good ones were sick of the trivial farce into which real work was\r\nnow transformed, while the inferior ones had a moral justification\r\nfor their laziness and idleness. In the distance something between a\r\nmob and a column marched along the road towards the regimental staff\r\nquarters, carrying crimson flags. Before them went a huge banner\r\nbearing the inscription, in white letters, visible in the distance:\r\n\"Down with War!\"\r\n\r\nThese were reinforcements coming up. At once, all the soldiers drilling\r\non the green, as if at a signal, broke their ranks and ran towards the\r\ncolumn.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, countrymen! What province are you from?\"\r\n\r\nAn animated conversation began on the usual anxious themes: how did\r\nmatters stand with the land; would peace be concluded soon? Much\r\ninterest, also, was shown in the question as to whether they had\r\nbrought any home-brewed spirits, as \"their own regimental\" home brew,\r\nmanufactured in fairly large quantities at \"the distillery\" of the\r\nThird Battalion, was very disgusting, and gave rise to painful symptoms.\r\n\r\nAlbov made his way to the mess-room. The officers were gathering for\r\ndinner. What had become of the former animation, friendly talk, healthy\r\nlaughter and torrents of reminiscences of a stormy, hard, but glorious\r\nlife of war? The reminiscences had faded, the dreams had flown away,\r\nand stern reality crushed them all down with its weight.\r\n\r\nThey spoke in low voices, sometimes breaking off or expressing\r\nthemselves figuratively: the mess servants might denounce them, and\r\nalso new faces had appeared among themselves. Not so long ago the\r\nRegimental Committee, on the report of a servant, had tried an officer\r\nof the regiment, who wore the Cross of St. George and to whom the\r\nregiment owed one of its most famous victories. This Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nhad said something about \"mutinous slaves.\" And though it was proved\r\nthat those were not his own words and that he had only quoted a speech\r\nmade by Comrade Kerensky, the Committee \"expressed its indignation at\r\nhim\"; he had to leave the regiment.\r\n\r\nThe personnel of the officers, too, was much changed. Of the original\r\nstaff, some two or three remained. Some had perished, others had been\r\ncrippled, others again, having earned \"distrust,\" were wandering about\r\nthe Front, importuning Staffs, joining shock battalions, entering\r\ninstitutions in the rear, while some of the weaker brethren had simply\r\ngone home. The Army had ceased to need the bearers of the traditions\r\nof its units, of its former glory--of those old Bourgeois prejudices,\r\nwhich had been swept into the dust by the Revolutionary creative power.\r\n\r\nEveryone in the regiment knows already of that morning's event in\r\nAlbov's Company. He is questioned about details. A Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nsitting next him wagged his head.\r\n\r\n\"Well done, our old man. There was something in the Fifth Company, too.\r\nBut I am afraid it will end badly. Have you heard what was done to the\r\nCommander of the Doubov Regiment, because he refused to confirm an\r\nelected Company Commander and put three agitators under arrest? _He was\r\ncrucified._ Yes, my boy! They nailed him to a tree and began, in turn,\r\nto stick their bayonets into him, to cut off his ears, his nose, his\r\nfingers.\"\r\n\r\nHe seized his head in his hands.\r\n\r\n\"My God! Where do these men get so much brutality, so much baseness?\"\r\n\r\nAt the other end of the table the ensigns are carrying on a conversation\r\non that ever harassing theme--where to get away to.\r\n\r\n\"Have you applied for admission to the Revolutionary Battalion?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it is not worth while. It seems that it is being formed under the\r\nsuperintendence of the Executive Committee, with Committees, elections\r\nand \"Revolutionary\" discipline. It does not suit me.\"\r\n\r\n\"They say that shock units are being formed in Kornilov's Army and at\r\nMinsk also. That would be good....\"\r\n\r\n\"I have applied for transfer to our rifle brigade in France. Only I do\r\nnot know what I am to do about the language.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! my boy, you are too late,\" remarked the Lieutenant-Colonel from\r\nthe other end of the table. \"The Government has long ago sent 'emigrant\r\ncomrades' there to enlighten minds. And now our brigades, somewhere\r\nin the South of France, are in the situation of something like either\r\nprisoners of war or disciplinary battalions.\"\r\n\r\nThis talk, however, was realised by all to be of a purely platonic\r\ncharacter, in view of the hopelessness of a situation from which there\r\nwas no escape. It was only a case of dreaming a little, as Tchekhov's\r\n_Three Sisters_ once dreamed of Moscow. Dreaming of such a wondrous\r\nplace, where human dignity is not trampled into the mud daily, where\r\none can live quietly and die honourably, without violence and without\r\noutrage to one's service. Such a very little thing.\r\n\r\n\"Mitka, bread!\" boomed out the mighty bass of 2nd Lieutenant Yassny.\r\n\r\nHe is quite a character, this Yassny. Tall and sturdy, with a\r\nthick crop of hair and a copper-coloured beard, he is altogether\r\nan embodiment of the strength and courage of the soil. He wears\r\nfour crosses of St. George, and has been promoted from the rank of\r\nSergeant for distinction in action. He does not adapt himself to his\r\nnew surroundings in the least, said \"levorution\" for \"revolution\" and\r\n\"mettink\" for \"meeting,\" and cannot reconcile himself to the new order.\r\nYassny's undoubted \"democratic\" views, his candour and sincerity,\r\nhave given him an exceptionally privileged position in the regiment.\r\nWithout enjoying any special influence, he can, however, condemn,\r\nrudely, harshly, sometimes with an oath, both people and ideas, which\r\nare jealously guarded and worshipped by the regimental \"Revolutionary\r\nDemocracy.\" The men are angry, but suffer him.\r\n\r\n\"There is no bread, I say.\"\r\n\r\nThe officers, absorbed in their thoughts and in their conversation, had\r\nnot even noticed that they had eaten their soup without bread.\r\n\r\n\"There will be no bread to-day,\" answered the waiter.\r\n\r\n\"What is the meaning of this? Call the mess-sergeant.\"\r\n\r\nThe mess-sergeant came, and began to justify himself in a bewildered\r\nmanner; he had sent in a request that morning for two pouds of bread.\r\nThe head of the Commissariat had endorsed it \"to be issued,\" but the\r\nclerk, Fedotov, a member of the Commissariat Committee, had endorsed it\r\nin his turn \"not to be issued.\" So the storehouse would not issue any\r\nbread.\r\n\r\nNo one made any objection, so painfully ashamed was everyone both of\r\nthe mess-sergeant and of those depths of inanity which had suddenly\r\nbroken into their life and swamped it with a grey, filthy slime.\r\nOnly Yassny's bass voice rang out distinctly under the arches of the\r\nmess-room:\r\n\r\n\"What swine!\"\r\n\r\nAlbov was just preparing for a nap after dinner when the flap of his\r\ntent was lifted, and through the aperture appeared the bald head of the\r\nChief of the Commissariat--a quiet, elderly Colonel, who had joined the\r\nArmy again from the retired list.\r\n\r\n\"May I come in?\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, Colonel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, my dear fellow, don't get up. I have just come in for a\r\nsecond. You see, to-day at six o'clock there is to be a regimental\r\nmeeting. It will hear the Report of the Committee for verifying\r\nthe Commissariat, and apparently they will go for me. I am no\r\nspeech-maker, but you are a master of it. Take my part, should it be\r\nnecessary.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. I did not intend going, but once it is necessary, I shall\r\nbe there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, then, my dear fellow.\"\r\n\r\nBy six o'clock the square next to the regimental Staff quarters was\r\ncompletely covered with men. At least two thousand had turned up.\r\nThe crowd moved, chattered, laughed--just such a Russian crowd as\r\non the Khodynka in Moscow or the _Champs de Mars_ in Petrograd at a\r\nholiday entertainment. The Revolution could not transform it all at\r\nonce, either mentally or spiritually. But, having stunned it with a\r\ntorrent of new words and opened up before it unbounded possibilities,\r\nthe Revolution had destroyed its equilibrium and made it nervously\r\nsusceptible and stormily reactive to all methods of external influence.\r\nAn ocean of words--both morally lofty and basely criminal--flowed\r\nthrough their minds as through a sieve, which passed through the\r\ntrend of the new ideas and retained only those grains which had a\r\nreal applied meaning in their daily life, in the surroundings of\r\nthe soldier, the peasant, the workman. Hence the absolute absence\r\nof results from the torrents of eloquence which flooded the Army at\r\nthe instance of the Minister of War; hence, too, the illogical warm\r\nsympathy with both speakers of clearly opposed politics.\r\n\r\nUnder such conditions, what practical meaning could the crowd find in\r\nsuch ideas as duty, honour, interests of the State, on the one hand;\r\nannexations, indemnities, the self-determination of peoples, conscious\r\ndiscipline, and other dim conceptions on the other.\r\n\r\nThe whole regiment had turned out; the soldiers were attracted by\r\nthe meeting, as by any other spectacle. Delegates had been sent by\r\nthe Second Battalion, which was in the trenches--about one-third of\r\nthe battalion. In the middle of the square stood a platform for the\r\nspeakers; it was decorated with red flags, faded with time and rain;\r\nthey have been there since the platform was erected for a review by the\r\nCommander of the Army. Reviews are now held not among the ranks, but\r\nfrom a tribune. To-day the agenda of the meeting contain two questions:\r\n\"(1) The Report of the Commissariat Committee on the anomalies in the\r\nsupply of Officers' rations; and (2) the report of Comrade Sklianka,\r\nan orator specially invited from the Moscow Soviet to speak about the\r\nformation of a Coalition Ministry.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the preceding week a stormy meeting, which nearly ended in a\r\nriot, had been held in connection with the complaint of one of the\r\ncompanies that the soldiers had to eat lentils, which they hated,\r\nand thin soup, simply because all the groats and butter were taken\r\nfor the officers' mess. This was clearly nonsense. Nevertheless, it\r\nwas resolved to appoint a Committee for investigation, which would\r\nreport to a general meeting of the regiment. The Report was drawn up\r\nby a member of the Committee, Lieutenant-Colonel Petrov, who had been\r\nremoved the year before from the post of Chief of the Commissariat and\r\nwas now settling accounts with his successor. In a petty, cavilling\r\nway, with a sort of mean irony, he enumerated slight, irrelevant,\r\ninaccuracies in the Commissariat Department of the regiment--there were\r\nno serious ones--and dragged out his Report endlessly in his creaking,\r\nmonotonous voice. The crowd, which at first had kept quiet, now hummed\r\nagain, having ceased to listen. From different sides voices were heard:\r\n\r\n\"Enough!\"\r\n\r\n\"That will do!\"\r\n\r\nThe Chairman of the Commission ceased reading and suggested that \"those\r\ncomrades who wished\" should express their opinions. A tall, stout\r\nsoldier ascended the platform, and began speaking in a loud, hysterical\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n\"Comrades, you have heard? That is where the soldiers' property goes.\r\nWe suffer, our clothes are worn out, we are covered with lice, we go\r\nhungry, while they pull the last piece of food out of our mouths.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke a spirit of nervous excitement kept growing in the crowd,\r\nmuffled murmurs ran through it, and shouts of approval burst from it\r\nhere and there.\r\n\r\n\"When will there be an end to all this? We are worn out, weary to\r\ndeath.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly 2nd Lieut. Yassny's deep voice was heard from the rear ranks,\r\ndrowning the voices both of the speaker and of the crowd.\r\n\r\n\"What is your Company?\"\r\n\r\nSome confusion took place. The orator was dumb. Shouts of indignation\r\nwere flung at Yassny.\r\n\r\n\"What is your Company, I ask you?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Seventh!\"\r\n\r\nVoices were heard in the ranks:\r\n\r\n\"We have no such man in the Seventh Company.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait a bit, my friend,\" boomed Yassny, \"was it not you that came in\r\nto-day with the new lot ... you were carrying a large placard? When\r\nhave you had time to get worn out, poor fellow?\"\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the crowd changed in an instant. It began to hiss, laugh,\r\nshout, and crack jokes. The unsuccessful orator disappeared in the\r\ncrowd. Someone shouted:\r\n\r\n\"Pass a resolution!\"\r\n\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Petrov mounted the platform again, and began to\r\nread out a ready resolution for transferring the officers' mess to\r\nprivates' rations. But no one listened to him now. Two or three voices\r\nshouted \"That's right!\" Petrov hesitated a little, then put the paper\r\nin his pocket and left the platform. The second question, concerning\r\nthe removal of the Chief of the Commissariat and the immediate election\r\nof his successor (the author of the report was the candidate proposed)\r\nremained unread. The Chairman of the Committee then announced:\r\n\r\n\"Comrade Sklianka, member of the Executive Committee of the Moscow\r\nCouncil of Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates, will now address the\r\nmeeting.\"\r\n\r\nThey were tired of their own speakers--it was always one and the\r\nsame thing--and the arrival of a new man, somewhat advertised by\r\nthe Committee, aroused general interest. The crowd closed up round\r\nthe platform and was still. A small, black-haired man, nervous and\r\nshort-sighted, who constantly adjusted the eyeglasses which kept\r\nslipping off his nose, mounted the platform, or rather quickly ran\r\nup on to it. He began speaking rapidly, with much spirit and much\r\ngesticulation.\r\n\r\n\"Soldier comrades! Three months have passed already since the Petrograd\r\nworkers and Revolutionary soldiers threw off the yoke of the Czar and\r\nof all his Generals. The Bourgeoisie, in the person of Tereshtchenko,\r\nthe well-known sugar refiner; Konovalov, the factory owner; the\r\nlandowners, Gutchkov, Rodzianko, Miliukov, and other traitors to the\r\ninterests of the people, having seized the supreme power, have tried to\r\ndeceive the popular masses.\r\n\r\n\"The demand of the people that negotiations be commenced at once for\r\nthat peace which we are offered by our German worker and soldier\r\nbrethren--who are just as much bereft of all that makes life worth\r\nliving as we are--has ended in a fraud--a telegram from Miliukov to\r\nEngland and France to say that the Russian people are ready to fight\r\nuntil victory is attained.\r\n\r\n\"The unfortunate people understood that the supreme power had fallen\r\ninto even worse hands, _i.e._, into those of the sworn foes of the\r\nworkman and the peasant. Therefore the people shouted mightily: 'Down\r\nwith you, hands off!'\r\n\r\n\"And the accursed Bourgeoisie shook at the mighty cry of the workers\r\nand hypocritically invited to a share in their power the so-called\r\nDemocracy--the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Mensheviks, who always\r\nassociated with the Bourgeoisie for the betrayal of the interests of\r\nthe working people.\"\r\n\r\nHaving thus outlined the process of the formation of the Coalition\r\nMinistry, Comrade Sklianka passed in greater detail to the fascinating\r\nprospects of rural and factory anarchy, where \"the wrath of the\r\npeople sweeps away the yoke of capital\" and where \"Bourgeois property\r\ngradually passes into the hands of its real masters--the workmen and\r\nthe poorer peasants.\"\r\n\r\n\"The soldiers and the workmen still have enemies,\" he continued. \"These\r\nare the friends of the overthrown Czarist Government, the hardened\r\nadmirers of shooting, the knout, and blows. The most bitter foes of\r\nfreedom, they have now donned crimson rosettes, call you 'comrades' and\r\npretend to be friends, but cherish the blackest intentions in their\r\nhearts, preparing to restore the rule of the Romanovs.\r\n\r\n\"Soldiers, do not trust these wolves in sheep's clothing! They call\r\nyou to fresh slaughter. Well, follow them if you like! Let them pave\r\nthe path for the return of the bloody Czar with your corpses. Let your\r\norphans, your widows and children, deserted by all, pass again into\r\nslavery, hunger, beggary, and disease!\"\r\n\r\nThe speech undoubtedly had a great success. The atmosphere grew\r\nred-hot, the excitement increased--that excitement of the \"molten\r\nmass,\" in the presence of which it is impossible to foresee either the\r\nlimits or the tension, or the tracks along which the torrent will pour.\r\nThe crowd was noisy and agitated, accompanying with shouts of approval\r\nor curses against \"the enemies of the people\" those parts of the speech\r\nwhich especially touched its instincts, its naked, cruel egotism.\r\n\r\nAlbov, pale, with burning eyes, made his appearance on the platform.\r\nHe spoke excitedly of something or other to the chairman, who then\r\naddressed the crowd. The chairman's words were inaudible amidst the\r\nnoise; for a long time he waved his hands and the flag which he had\r\npulled down, until at last the noise had subsided somewhat.\r\n\r\n\"Comrades, Lieutenant Albov wishes to address you!\"\r\n\r\nShouts and hisses were heard.\r\n\r\n\"Down with him! We do not want him!\"\r\n\r\nBut Albov was already on the platform, gripping hard, bending downwards\r\ntowards the sea of heads. And he said:\r\n\r\n\"No, I will speak, and you dare not refuse to listen to one of those\r\nofficers whom this man has been abusing and dishonouring here before\r\nyou. Who he may be, whence he has come, who pays him for his speeches,\r\nso profitable to the Germans, not one of you knows. He has come here,\r\nbefogged you, and will go on his way to sow evil and treason. And you\r\nhave believed him. And we, who along with you have now carried our\r\nheavy cross into the fourth year of the War--we are now to be regarded\r\nas your enemies? Why? Is it because we never sent you into action,\r\nbut led you, bestrewing with officers' corpses the whole of the path\r\ncovered by the regiment? Is it because that, of the officers who led\r\nyou in the beginning, there is not one left in the regiment who is not\r\nmaimed?\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke with deep sincerity and pain in his voice. There were moments\r\nwhen it seemed as if his words were breaking through the withered crust\r\nof those hardened hearts, as if a break would again take place in the\r\nattitude of the crowd.\r\n\r\n\"He, your 'new friend,' is calling you to mutiny, to violence, to\r\nrobbery. Do you understand who will benefit when, in Russia, brother\r\nrises against brother, so as to turn to ashes, in sack and fire,\r\nthe last property left not only to the 'capitalists,' but to the\r\npoverty-stricken workers and peasants? No, it is not by violence,\r\nbut by law and right, that you will acquire land and liberty and a\r\ntolerable existence. Your enemies are not here, among the officers,\r\nbut there--beyond the barbed wire. And we shall not attain either to\r\nfreedom or to peace by a dishonourable, cowardly standing in one and\r\nthe same place, but in the general mighty rush of an _advance_.\"\r\n\r\nWas it that the impression of Sklianka's speech was still too vivid or\r\nthat the regiment took offence at the word \"cowardly\"--for the most\r\narrant coward will never forgive such a reminder--or, finally, was it\r\nthe fault of the magic word \"advance,\" which for some time past had\r\nceased to be tolerated in the Army? But anyhow Albov was not allowed to\r\ncontinue his speech.\r\n\r\nThe crowd bellowed, belched forth curses, pressed forward more and\r\nmore, advancing toward the platform, and broke down the railing. An\r\nominous roar, faces distorted with fury, and hands stretched forth\r\ntowards the platform. The situation was becoming critical. 2nd Lieut.\r\nYassny pushed his way through to Albov, took him by the arm, and\r\nforcibly led him to the exit. The soldiers of the First Company had\r\nalready rushed up to it from all sides, and with their aid Albov, with\r\ngreat difficulty, made his way out of the crowd, amidst a shower of\r\nchoice abuse. Someone shouted out after him:\r\n\r\n\"Wait a bit, you ----; we will settle accounts with you!\"\r\n\r\nNight. The bivouac had grown quiet. Clouds had covered the sky. It was\r\ndark. Albov, sitting on his bed in his narrow tent, illuminated by\r\nthe stump of a candle, was writing a report to the Commander of the\r\nRegiment:\r\n\r\n\"The officers--powerless, insulted, meeting with distrust and\r\ndisobedience from their subordinates--can be of no further use. I beg\r\nof you to apply for my reduction to the ranks, so that there I might\r\nfulfil my duty honestly and to the end.\"\r\n\r\nHe lay down on his bed. He gripped his head in his hands. A kind of\r\nuncanny, incomprehensible emptiness seized him, just as if some unseen\r\nhand had drawn out of his head all thought, out of his heart all pain.\r\nWhat was that? A noise was heard, the tent-pole fell down, the light\r\nwent out. A number of men on the tent. Hard, cruel blows were showered\r\non the whole of his body. A sharp, intolerable pain shot through his\r\nhead and his chest. Then his whole face seemed covered with a warm,\r\nsticky veil, and soon everything became still and calm again, as if all\r\nthat was terrible and hard to bear had torn itself away, had remained\r\nhere, on earth, while his soul was flying away somewhere and was\r\nfeeling light and joyous.\r\n\r\nAlbov awoke to feel something cold touching him: a private of his\r\ncompany, Goulkin, an elderly man, was sitting at the foot of his bed\r\nand wiping away the blood from his head with a wet towel. He noticed\r\nthat Albov had regained consciousness.\r\n\r\n\"Look how they have mangled the man, the scum! It can have been no\r\nother than the Fifth Company--I recognised one of them. Does it hurt\r\nyou much? Perhaps you would like me to go for the doctor?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, my friend, it does not matter. Thank you!\" and Albov pressed his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\"And their Commander, too, Captain Bouravin, has met with a misfortune.\r\nDuring the night they carried him past us on a stretcher, wounded\r\nin the abdomen; the _sanitar_ said that he would not live. He was\r\nreturning from reconnoitring, and the bullet took just at our very\r\nbarbed wire. Whether it was a German one or whether our own people did\r\nnot recognise him--who knows?\"\r\n\r\nHe was silent for a while.\r\n\r\n\"What has come to the people one simply can't understand. And all\r\nthis is just put on. It is not true--that which they say against the\r\nofficers--we understand that ourselves. Of course, there are all sorts\r\namong you. But we know them very well. Don't we see for ourselves that\r\nyou, now, are for us with all your heart. Or let us say 2nd Lieut.\r\nYassny. Could such a one sell himself? And yet, try to say a word, to\r\ntake your part--there would be no living for us. There is a great deal\r\nof hooliganism now. It is only hooligans that men listen to. My idea is\r\nthat all this is taking place because men have forgotten God. Men have\r\nnothing to be afraid of.\"\r\n\r\nAlbov closed his eyes from weakness. Goulkin hastily arranged the\r\nblanket, which had slipped to the floor, made the sign of the cross\r\nover him, and quietly slipped out of the tent.\r\n\r\nBut sleep would not come. His heart was full of an inexhaustible\r\nsadness and an oppressive feeling of loneliness. He yearned so much to\r\nhave some living being at hand, so that he might silently, wordlessly\r\nfeel its proximity, and not remain alone with his dreadful thoughts. He\r\nregretted that he had not detained Goulkin.\r\n\r\nAll was quiet. The whole camp was sleeping. Albov leaped from his bed\r\nand lit the candle again. He was seized with a dull, hopeless despair.\r\nHe had no more faith in anything. Impenetrable darkness lay before\r\nhim. To make his exit from life? No, that would be surrender. He\r\nmust go on, with clenched teeth and hardened heart, until some stray\r\nbullet--Russian or German--broke the thread of his wearisome days.\r\n\r\nDawn was coming on. A new day was beginning, new Army week-days,\r\nhorribly like their predecessors.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfterwards?\r\n\r\nAfterwards the \"molten element\" overflowed its banks completely.\r\nOfficers were killed, burnt, drowned, torn asunder and had their heads\r\nbroken through with hammers, slowly, with inexpressible cruelty.\r\n\r\nAfterwards--millions of deserters. Like an avalanche the soldiery moved\r\nalong the railways, water-ways and country roads, trampling down,\r\nbreaking and destroying the last nerves of poor, roadless Russia.\r\n\r\nAfterwards--Tarnopol, Kalush, Kazan. Like a whirlwind robbery, murder,\r\nviolence, incendiarism swept over Galicia, Volynia, the Podolsk and\r\nother provinces, leaving behind it everywhere a trail of blood and\r\narousing in the minds of the Russian people, crazed with grief and weak\r\nin spirit, the monstrous thought:\r\n\r\n\"O Lord! if only the Germans would come quickly.\"\r\n\r\nThis was done by the soldier.\r\n\r\nThat soldier of whom a great Russian writer, with intuitive conscience\r\nand a bold heart, has said:[27]\r\n\r\n\"... How many hast thou killed during these days, oh soldier? How many\r\norphans hast thou made? How many inconsolable mothers hast thou left?\r\nDost thou hear the whisper on their lips, from which thou hast driven\r\nthe smile of joy for evermore?\r\n\r\n\"Murderer! Murderer!\r\n\r\n\"But why speak of mothers, of orphaned children? A more terrible moment\r\ncame, which none had expected--and thou didst betray Russia, thou didst\r\ncast the whole of the Motherland, which had bred thee, under the feet\r\nof the foe!\r\n\r\n\"Thou, oh soldier, whom we loved so--and whom we still love.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nOFFICERS' ORGANISATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the early days of April the idea arose among the Headquarters'\r\nofficers of organising a \"Union of the Officers of the Army and the\r\nNavy.\" The initiators of the Union[28] started with the view that it\r\nwas necessary \"to think alike, so as to understand alike the events\r\nthat were taking place, to work in the same direction,\" for up to the\r\npresent time \"the voice of the officers--of all the officers--has been\r\nheard by none. As yet we have said nothing about the great events\r\namidst which we are living. Everyone who chooses says for us whatever\r\nhe chooses. Military questions, and even the questions of our daily\r\nlife and internal order, are settled for us by anyone who likes and in\r\nany way he likes.\" There were two objections made in principle, one\r\nbeing the objection to the introduction by the officers themselves\r\ninto their ranks of those principles of collective self-government\r\nwith which the Army had been inoculated from outside, in the form of\r\nSoviets, Committees and Congresses, and had brought disintegration\r\ninto it. The second objection was the fear lest the appearance of an\r\nindependent Officers' Organisation should deepen still more those\r\ndifferences which had arisen between the soldiers and the officers.\r\nOn the basis of these views we, along with the Commander-in-Chief, at\r\nfirst took up an altogether negative attitude towards this proposal.\r\nBut life had already broken out of its bounds and laughed at our\r\nmotives. A draft declaration was published, granting the Army full\r\nfreedom for forming Unions and meetings, and it would now have been an\r\ninjustice to the officers to deprive them of the right of professional\r\norganisation, if only as a means of self-preservation. In practice,\r\nofficers' societies had sprung up in many of the Armies, and in Kiev,\r\nMoscow, Petrograd and other towns they had done so from the earlier\r\ndays of the Revolution. They all wandered in different directions,\r\ngroping their way, while some Unions in the large centres, under the\r\ninfluence of the disintegrating conditions of the rear, displayed a\r\nstrong leaning towards the policy of the Soviets.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the rear frequently lived a completely different\r\nspiritual life from those of the Front. Thus, for instance, the Moscow\r\nSoviet of officers' delegates passed, in the beginning of April, a\r\nresolution to the effect that \"the work of the Provisional Government\r\nshould proceed ... in the spirit of the Socialistic and political\r\ndemands of the Democracy, represented by the Council of Workmen's and\r\nSoldiers' Delegates,\" and expressed a wish that there should be more\r\nrepresentatives of the Socialist parties in the Provisional Government.\r\nAn adulteration of the officers' views was also developing on a\r\nlarger scale; the Petrograd officers' Council summoned an \"All-Russia\r\nCongress of officers' delegates, Army surgeons and officers\" in\r\nPetrograd for May 8th. This circumstance was the more undesirable in\r\nthat the initiator of the Congress--the Executive Committee, with\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Goushchin, of the General Staff, at its head--had\r\nalready disclosed to the full its negative policy by its participation\r\nin the drafting of the declaration of soldiers' rights, by its active\r\nco-operation in the Polivanov Commission and its servility before the\r\nCouncil of Workmen's and Soldier's Delegates, and by its endeavours\r\nto unite with it. A proposal in this sense being made, the Council,\r\nhowever, replied that such a union was \"as yet impossible on technical\r\ngrounds.\"\r\n\r\nHaving discounted all these circumstances, the Supreme\r\nCommander-in-Chief gave his approval to the summoning of a Congress of\r\nofficers, on condition that no pressure should be exercised either in\r\nhis name or in that of the Chief-of-Staff. This scrupulous attitude\r\nsomewhat complicated matters. Some of the Staffs, being out of sympathy\r\nwith the idea, prevented the circulation of the appeal, while some of\r\nthe High Commanders, as, for example, the Commander of the troops of\r\nthe Omsk district, forbade the delegation of officers altogether. In\r\nsome places also this question roused the suspicion of the soldiers and\r\ncaused some complications, in consequence of which the initiators of\r\nthe Congress invited the units to delegate soldiers as well as officers\r\nto be present at the sessions.\r\n\r\nDespite all obstacles, over 300 officer delegates gathered in Moghilev,\r\n76 per cent. being from the Front, 17 per cent. from fighting units in\r\nthe rear, and 7 per cent. from the rear. On May 7th the Congress was\r\nopened with a speech by the Supreme Commander-in-Chief. On that day,\r\nfor the first time, the High Command said, not in a secret meeting,\r\nnot in a confidential letter, but openly, before the whole country:\r\n\"Russia is perishing.\" General Alexeiev said: \"In appeals, in general\r\norders, in the columns of the Daily Press, we often meet with the short\r\nsentence: 'Our country is in danger.'\r\n\r\n\"We have grown too well accustomed to this phrase. We feel as if we\r\nwere reading an old chronicle of bygone days, and do not ponder over\r\nthe grim meaning of this curt sentence. But, gentlemen, this is, I\r\nregret to say, a serious fact. _Russia is perishing. She stands on\r\nthe brink of an abyss. A few more shocks, and she will crash with all\r\nher weight into it._ The enemy has occupied one-eighth part of her\r\nterritory. He cannot be bribed by the Utopian phrase: 'Peace without\r\nannexations or indemnities.' He says frankly that he will not leave our\r\nsoil. He is stretching forth his greedy grip to lands where no enemy\r\nsoldier has ever set foot--to the rich lands of Volynia, Podolia and\r\nKiev--_i.e._, to the whole right bank of our Dnieper.\r\n\r\n\"And what are we going to do? Will the Russian Army allow this to\r\nhappen? Will we not thrust this insolent foe out of our country and let\r\nthe diplomatists conclude peace afterwards, with annexations or without\r\nthem?\r\n\r\n\"Let us be frank. The fighting spirit of the Russian Army has fallen;\r\nbut yesterday strong and terrible, it now stands in fatal impotence\r\nbefore the foe. Its former traditional loyalty to the Motherland has\r\nbeen replaced by a yearning for peace and rest. Instead of fortitude,\r\nthe baser instincts and a thirst for self-preservation are rampant.\r\n\r\n\"At home, where is that strong authority for which the whole country\r\nis craving? Where is that powerful authority which would force every\r\ncitizen to do his duty honestly by the Motherland?\r\n\r\n\"We are told that it will soon appear, but as yet it does not exist.\r\n\r\n\"Where is the love of country, where is patriotism?\r\n\r\n\"The great word 'brotherhood' has been inscribed on our banners, but\r\nit has not been inscribed in our hearts and minds. Class enmity rages\r\namongst us. Whole classes which have honestly fulfilled their duty to\r\ntheir country have fallen under suspicion, and on this foundation a\r\ndeep gulf has been created between two parts of the Army--the officers\r\nand the soldiers.\r\n\r\n\"And it is at this very moment that the first Congress of officers of\r\nthe Russian Army has been summoned. I am of the opinion that a more\r\nconvenient, a more timely moment, could not have been chosen to attain\r\nunity in our family, to form a general united family of the corps of\r\nRussian officers, to discuss the means of breathing ardour into our\r\nhearts, _for without ardour there is no victory, without victory there\r\nis no salvation, no Russia_.\r\n\r\n\"May your work therefore be inspired with love for your Motherland and\r\nwith heartfelt regard for the soldier; mark the ways for raising the\r\nmoral and intellectual calibre of the soldiers, so that they may become\r\nyour sincere and hearty comrades. Do away with that estrangement which\r\nhas been artificially sown in our family.\r\n\r\n\"At the present moment--this is a disease common to all--people would\r\nlike to set all the citizens of Russia on platforms or pedestals and\r\nscrutinise how many stand behind each of them. What does it matter that\r\nthe masses of the Army accepted the new order and the new Constitution\r\nsincerely, honestly and with enthusiasm?\r\n\r\n\"_We must all unite on one great object: Russia is in danger. As\r\nmembers of the great Army, we must save her. Let this object unite us\r\nand give us strength to work._\"\r\n\r\nThis speech, in which the leader of the Army expressed \"the anxiety of\r\nhis heart,\" served as the prologue to his retirement. The Revolutionary\r\nDemocracy had already passed its sentence on General Alexeiev at\r\nits memorable session with the Commanders-in-Chief on May 4th; now,\r\nafter May 7th, a bitter campaign was begun against him in the Radical\r\nPress, in which the Soviet semi-official organ _Isvestia_ competed\r\nwith Lenin's papers in the triviality and impropriety of its remarks.\r\nThis campaign was the more significant in that the Minister of War,\r\nKerensky, was clearly on the side of the Soviet in this matter.\r\n\r\nAs if to supplement the words of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, I said\r\nin my speech, when touching on the internal situation in the country:\r\n\r\n\"... Under pressure of the unavoidable laws of history, autocracy has\r\nfallen, and our country has passed under the rule of the people. We\r\nstand on the threshold of a new life, long and passionately awaited,\r\nfor which many thousand Idealists have gone to the block, languished in\r\nthe mines and pined in the _tundras_.\r\n\r\n\"But we look to the future with anxiety and perplexity.\r\n\r\n\"For there is no liberty in the Revolutionary torture-chamber.\r\n\r\n\"There is no righteousness in misrepresenting the voice of the people.\r\n\r\n\"There is no equality in the hounding down of classes.\r\n\r\n\"And there is no strength in that insane rout where all around seek to\r\ngrasp all that they possibly can, at the expense of their suffering\r\ncountry, where thousands of greedy hands are stretched out towards\r\npower, breaking down the foundations of that country....\"\r\n\r\nThen the sessions of the Congress began. Whoever was present has\r\ncarried away, probably for the rest of his life, an indelible\r\nimpression produced by the story of the sufferings of the officers.\r\nIt could never be written, as it was told with chilling restraint by\r\nthese, Captain Bouravin and Lieutenant Albov, who touched upon their\r\nmost intimate and painful experiences. They had suffered till they\r\ncould suffer no more; in their hearts there were neither tears nor\r\ncomplaints.\r\n\r\nI looked at the boxes, where the \"younger comrades\" sat who had been\r\nsent to watch for \"counter-Revolution.\" I wanted to read in their faces\r\nthe impression produced by all that they had heard. And it seemed to me\r\nthat I saw the blush of shame. Probably it only seemed so to me, for\r\nthey soon made a stormy protest, demanded the right of voting at the\r\nCongress, and--five roubles per day \"officer's allowance.\"\r\n\r\nAt thirteen general meetings the Congress passed a series of\r\nresolutions.\r\n\r\nAmong all the classes, castes, professions and trades which exhibited a\r\ngeneral elemental desire to get from the weak Government all that was\r\npossible, in their own private interests, the officers were the only\r\nCorporation which never asked anything _for itself personally_.\r\n\r\nThe officers requested and demanded _authority_--over themselves and\r\nover the Army. A firm, single, national authority--\"commanding, not\r\nappealing.\" The authority of a Government leaning on the trust of the\r\nnation, not on irresponsible organisations. Such an authority the\r\nofficers were prepared wholeheartedly and unreservedly to obey, _quite\r\nirrespective of differences of political opinions_. I affirm, moreover,\r\nthat all the inner social class conflict which was blazing up more and\r\nmore throughout the country did not affect the officers at the Front,\r\nwho were immersed in their work and in their sorrows; it did not touch\r\nthem deeply; the conflict attracted the attention of the officers\r\nonly when its results obviously endangered the very existence of the\r\ncountry, and of the Army in particular. Of course, I am speaking of the\r\nmass of the officers; individual leanings towards reaction undoubtedly\r\nexisted, but they were in no respect characteristic of the Officers'\r\nCorps in 1917.\r\n\r\nOne of the finest representatives of the Officers' Class, General\r\nMarkov, a thoroughly educated man, wrote to Kerensky, condemning his\r\nsystem of slighting the Command: \"Being a soldier by nature, birth and\r\neducation, I can judge and speak only of my own military profession.\r\nAll other reforms and alterations in the constitution of our country\r\ninterest me only as an ordinary citizen. But I know the Army; I have\r\ndevoted to it the best days of my life; I have paid for its successes\r\nwith the blood of those who were near to me, and have myself come out\r\nof action steeped in blood.\" This the Revolutionary Democracy had not\r\nunderstood or taken into consideration.\r\n\r\nThe Officers' Congress in Petrograd, at which about 700 delegates\r\nwere gathered (May 18-26), passed off in a totally different manner.\r\nIt split into two sharply-divided camps: the Officers and officials\r\nof the Rear who had given themselves to politics and a smaller number\r\nof real officers of the Line who had become delegates through a\r\nmisunderstanding of the matter. The Executive Committee drew up their\r\nprogramme in strict agreement with the custom of the Soviet Congresses:\r\n(1) The attitude of the Congress towards the Provisional Government and\r\nthe Soviet; (2) the War; (3) the Constituent Assembly; (4) the labour\r\nquestion; (5) the land question; and (6) the reorganisation of the\r\nArmy on Democratic principles. An exaggerated importance was attached\r\nto the Congress in Petrograd, and at its opening pompous speeches were\r\nmade by many members of the Government and by foreign representatives;\r\nthe Congress was even greeted in the name of the Soviet by Nahamkes.\r\nThe very first day revealed the irreconcilable differences between the\r\ntwo groups. These differences were inevitable, if only because, even\r\non such a cardinal question as \"Order No. 1.,\" the Vice-Chairman of\r\nthe Congress, Captain Brzozek, expressed the view that \"its issue was\r\ndictated by historical necessity: the soldier was downtrodden, and it\r\nwas imperatively necessary to free him.\" This declaration was greeted\r\nwith prolonged applause by part of the delegates!\r\n\r\nAfter a series of stormy meetings, a resolution was passed by a\r\nmajority of 265 against 246, which stated that \"the Revolutionary power\r\nof the country was in the hands of the organised peasants, workmen and\r\nsoldiers, who form the predominating mass of the population,\" and that\r\ntherefore the Government must be responsible to the All-Russia Soviet!\r\n\r\nEven the resolution advocating an advance was passed by a majority of\r\nlittle more than two-thirds of those who cast their votes.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the Petrograd Congress is to be explained by the\r\ndeclaration made on May 26th by that group, which, reflecting the\r\nreal opinion of the Front, took the point of view of \"all possible\r\nsupport to the Provisional Government.\" \"In summoning the Congress the\r\nExecutive Committee of the Petrograd Council of Officers' Delegates\r\ndid not seek for the solution of the most essential problem of the\r\nmoment--the regeneration of the Army--since the question of the\r\nfighting capacity of the Army and of the measures for raising its\r\nlevel was not even mentioned in the programme, and was included only\r\nat our request. If we are to believe the statement--strange, to say no\r\nmore--made by the Chairman, Lieutenant-Colonel Goushchin, the object of\r\nthe summoning of the Congress was the desire of the Executive Committee\r\nto pass under our flag into the Council of Workmen's and Soldiers'\r\nDelegates.\" This declaration led to a series of serious incidents;\r\nthree-quarters of the delegates left the meeting and the Congress came\r\nto an end.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned the question of the Petrograd Officers' Council and\r\nCongress only in order to show the spirit of a certain section of the\r\nofficers of the Rear, which was in frequent contact with the official\r\nand unofficial rulers, and represented, in the eyes of the latter, the\r\n\"voice of the Army.\"\r\n\r\nThe Moghilev Congress, which attracted the unflagging attention of the\r\nSupreme Commander-in-Chief, and was much favoured by him, closed on May\r\n22nd. At this time General Alexeiev had already been relieved of the\r\ncommand of the Russian Army. So deeply had this episode affected him\r\nthat he was unable to attend the last meeting. I bade farewell to the\r\nCongress in the following words:\r\n\r\n\"The Supreme Commander-in-Chief, who is leaving his post, has\r\ncommissioned me, gentlemen, to convey to you his sincere greetings, and\r\nto say that his heart, that of an old soldier, beats in unison with\r\nyours, that it aches with the same pain, and lives with the same hope\r\nfor the regeneration of the disrupted, but ever great, Russian Army.\r\n\r\n\"Let me add a few words from myself.\r\n\r\n\"You have gathered here from the distant blood-bespattered marches of\r\nour land, and laid before us your quenchless sorrow and your soul-felt\r\ngrief.\r\n\r\n\"You have unrolled before us a vivid and painful picture of the life\r\nand work of the officers amidst the raging sea of the Army.\r\n\r\n\"You, who have stood a countless number of times in the face of death!\r\nYou, who have intrepidly led your men against the dense rows of the\r\nenemy's barbed wire, to the rare boom of your own guns, treacherously\r\ndeprived of ammunition! You, who, hardening your hearts, but keeping\r\nup your spirits, have cast the last handful of earth into the grave of\r\nyour fallen son, brother, or friend!\r\n\r\n\"Will you quail now?\r\n\r\n\"No!\r\n\r\n\"You who are weak, raise your heads. You who are strong, give of your\r\ndetermination, of your aspirations, of your desire to work for the\r\nhappiness of your Motherland--pour them into the thinned ranks of your\r\ncomrades at the Front. You are not alone. With you are all those who\r\nare honourable, all who think, all who have paused at the brink of that\r\ncommon sense which is now being abolished.\r\n\r\n\"The soldiers also will go with you, understanding clearly that you are\r\nleading them, not backwards, to serfdom and to spiritual poverty, but\r\nforwards, to freedom and to light.\r\n\r\n\"And then such a thunderstorm will break over the foe as will put an\r\nend both to him and to the War.\r\n\r\n\"These three years of the War I have lived one life with you, thought\r\nthe same thoughts, shared with you the joy of victory and the burning\r\npain of retreat. I have therefore the right to fling into the faces of\r\nthose who have outraged our hearts, who from the very first days of the\r\nRevolution have wrought the work of Cain on the corps of officers--I\r\nhave the right to fling in their faces the words: 'You lie! The Russian\r\nofficer has never been either a mercenary or a Pretorian.'\r\n\r\n\"Under the old régime you were victimised, down-trodden, and deprived\r\nof all that makes life worth living. In no less a degree than\r\nyourselves, leading a life of semi-beggary, our officers of the Line\r\nhave managed to carry through their wretched, laborious life like a\r\nburning torch, the thirst for achievement for the happiness of his\r\nMotherland.\r\n\r\n\"Then let my call be heard through these walls by the builders of the\r\nnew life of the State:\r\n\r\n\"Take care of the officer! For from the beginning and till now he has\r\nstood, faithfully and without relief, on guard over the order of the\r\nRussian State. He can be relieved by death alone.\"\r\n\r\nPrinted by the Committee, the text of my speech was circulated at the\r\nFront, and I was happy to learn, from many letters and telegrams, that\r\nthe words spoken in defence of the officer had touched his aching heart.\r\n\r\nThe Congress left a permanent institution at the Stavka--the \"Chief\r\nCommittee of the Officers' Union.\"[29] During the first three months of\r\nits existence the Committee did not succeed in rooting itself deeply\r\nin the Army. Its activities were confined to organising branches of the\r\nUnion in the Armies and in military circles, to the examination of the\r\ncomplaints that reached it. In exceptional cases incompetent officers\r\nwere recommended for dismissal (the \"black-board\"); to a certain\r\nvery limited degree officers expelled by the soldiers were granted\r\nassistance, and declarations were addressed to the Government and to\r\nthe Press in connection with the more important events in public and\r\nmilitary life. After the June advance the tone of these declarations\r\nbecame acrimonious, critical, and defiant, which seriously disturbed\r\nthe Prime Minister, who persistently sought to have the Chief Committee\r\ntransferred from Moghilev to Moscow, as he considered that its attitude\r\nwas a danger to the Stavka.\r\n\r\nThe Committee, which was somewhat passive during the command of General\r\nBrussilov, did, indeed, take part afterwards in General Kornilov's\r\nventure. But it was not this circumstance that caused the change in its\r\nattitude. _The Committee undoubtedly reflected the general spirit with\r\nwhich the Command and the Russian officers were then imbued, a spirit\r\nwhich had become hostile to the Provisional Government._ Also, no\r\nclear idea had been formed among the officers of the political groups\r\nwithin the Government of the covert struggle proceeding between them,\r\nor of the protective part played by many representatives of the Liberal\r\nDemocracy among them. A hostile attitude was thus created towards the\r\nGovernment as a whole.\r\n\r\nHaving remained hitherto perfectly loyal and in the majority of cases\r\nwell-disposed, having patiently borne, much against the grain, the\r\nexperiments which the Provisional Government made, deliberately or\r\ninvoluntarily, on the country and on the Army, these elements lived\r\nonly in the hope of the regeneration of the Army, of an advance and of\r\nvictory. When all these hopes crashed to the ground, then, not being\r\nunited in their ideals with the second Coalitional Government, but,\r\non the contrary, deeply distrusting it, the masses of the officers\r\nabandoned the Provisional Government, which thus lost its last reliable\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nThis moment is of great historical importance, giving the key to the\r\nunderstanding of many later events. As a whole, deeply democratic\r\nin their personnel, views and conditions of life, _rejected by the\r\nRevolutionary Democracy_ with incredible harshness and cynicism,\r\nand finding no real support in the liberal circles in close touch\r\nwith the Government, the Russian officers found themselves in a\r\nstate of tragic isolation. This isolation and bewilderment served\r\nmore than once afterwards as a fertile soil for outside influences,\r\nforeign to the traditions of the officer caste and to its former\r\npolitical character--influences which led to dissension, and in the\r\nend to fratricide. For there can be no doubt that all the power, all\r\nthe organisation, both of the Red and of the White Armies, rested\r\nexclusively on the personality of the former Russian officer.\r\n\r\nAnd if afterwards, in the course of three years of conflict, we have\r\nwitnessed the rise of two conflicting forces in the Russian public life\r\nof the anti-Bolshevist camp, we must seek for their original source not\r\nin political differences only, but also in that work of Cain towards\r\nthe officers' caste, which was wrought by the Revolutionary Democracy\r\nfrom the first days of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nAs everyone realised that the \"new order\" and the Front itself are\r\non the verge of collapse, it was obvious that officers should have\r\nattempted some organisation to meet such a contingency. But the\r\nadvocates of action were lying in prison; the Chief Council of the\r\nOfficers' Union, which was best suited for this task, had been broken\r\nup by Kerensky in the latter days of August. The majority of the\r\nresponsible leaders of the Army were perturbed by a terrible and not\r\nunfounded fear for the fate of the Russian officers. In this respect\r\nthe correspondence between General Kornilov and General Doukhonin is\r\nvery characteristic. After the Bolshevist _coup d'état_ on November\r\n1 (14), 1917, General Kornilov wrote to Doukhonin from his prison in\r\nBykhov:\r\n\r\n\"Foreseeing the further course of events, I think that it is necessary\r\nfor you to take such measures as would create a favourable atmosphere,\r\nwhile thoroughly safeguarding Headquarters, for a struggle against the\r\ncoming Anarchy.\"\r\n\r\nAmong these measures General Kornilov suggested \"the concentration in\r\nMoghilev, or in a point near to it, under a reliable guard, of a store\r\nof rifles, cartridges, machine-guns, automatic guns and hand-grenades\r\nfor distribution among the officer-volunteers, who will undoubtedly\r\ngather together in this region.\"\r\n\r\nDoukhonin made a note against this point: \"This might lead to excesses.\"\r\n\r\nThus the constant morbid fears of an officers' \"Counter-Revolution\"\r\nproved to be in vain. Events took the officers unawares. They were\r\nunorganised, bewildered; they did not think of their own safety, and\r\nfinally scattered their forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE REVOLUTION AND THE COSSACKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA peculiar part was played by the Cossacks in the history of the\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nBuilt up historically, in the course of several centuries, the\r\nrelations of the Cossacks with the Central Government, common to\r\nRussia, were of a dual character. The Government did all to encourage\r\nthe development of Cossack colonisation on the Russian south-eastern\r\nborders, where war was unceasing. It made allowances for the\r\npeculiarities of the warlike, agricultural life of the Cossacks, and\r\nallowed them a certain degree of independence and individual forms of\r\ndemocratic rule, with representative organs (the Kosh, kroog, rada), an\r\nelected \"Army elder\" and hetmans.\r\n\r\n\"In its weakness,\" says Solovyov, \"The State did not look too strictly\r\non the activities of the Cossacks, so long as they were directed only\r\nagainst foreign lands; the State being weak, it was considered needful\r\nto give these restless forces an outlet.\" But the \"activities\" of the\r\nCossacks were more than once directed against Moscow as well. This\r\ncircumstance led to a prolonged internecine struggle, which lasted\r\nuntil the end of the eighteenth century, when, after a ferocious\r\nsuppression of the Pougatchov Rebellion, the free Cossacks of the\r\nSouth-East were dealt a final blow; they gradually lost their markedly\r\noppositionary character, and even gained the reputation of the most\r\nconservative element in the State, the pillars of the throne and the\r\nrégime.\r\n\r\nFrom that time onward the Government incessantly showed favour to the\r\nCossacks by emphasising their really great merits, by solemn promises\r\nto preserve their \"Cossack Liberties,\"[30] and by the appointment of\r\nmembers of the Imperial family to honorary posts among the Cossacks.\r\nAt the same time, the Government took all measures to prevent these\r\n\"liberties\" from developing to excess at the expense of that ruthless\r\ncentralisation, which was a historical necessity in the beginning of\r\nthe building up of the Russian State and a vast historical blunder\r\nin its later development. To the number of these measures we must\r\nrefer the limitation of Cossack self-government, and, latterly, the\r\ntraditional appointment to the post of Hetman of persons not belonging\r\nto the Cossack caste, and often complete strangers to the life of the\r\nCossacks. The oldest and most numerous Cossack Army, that of the Don,\r\nhas had Generals of German origin at its head more than once.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if the Czarist Government had every reason to depend upon\r\nthe Cossacks. The repeated repression of the local political labour\r\nand agrarian disturbances which broke out in Russia, the crushing of\r\na more serious rising--the revolution of 1905-1906, in which a great\r\npart was played by the Cossack troops--all this seemed to confirm the\r\nestablished opinion of the Cossacks. On the other hand, sundry episodes\r\nof the \"repressions,\" accompanied by inevitable violence, sometimes\r\ncruelty, were widely spread among the people, were exaggerated, and\r\ncreated a hostile attitude towards the Cossacks at the factories,\r\nin the villages, among the Liberal _intelligencia_, and especially\r\namong those elements which are known as the Revolutionary Democracy.\r\nThroughout the whole of the underground literature--in its appeals,\r\nleaflets, and pictures--the idea of a \"Cossack\" became synonymous with\r\n\"servant\" of the Reactionary party.\r\n\r\nThis definition was greatly exaggerated. The bard of the Don Cossacks,\r\nMitrophan Bogayevsky, says of the political character of the Cossacks:\r\n\"The first and fundamental condition which prevented the Cossacks, at\r\nleast in the beginning, from breaking up was the idea of the State,\r\na lawful order, a deep-seated realisation of the necessity of a life\r\nwithin the bounds of law. This seeking of a lawful order runs, and has\r\nrun, like a scarlet thread through all the circles of all the Cossack\r\nArmies.\" But such altruistic motives, by themselves, do not exhaust the\r\nquestion. Notwithstanding the grievous weight of universal military\r\nservice, the Cossacks, especially those of the South, enjoyed a certain\r\nprosperity which excluded that important stimulus which roused against\r\nthe Government and the régime both the workers' class and the peasantry\r\nof Central Russia. An extraordinarily complicated agrarian question\r\nset the caste economic interests of the Cossacks against the interests\r\nof the \"outsider\"[31] settlers. Thus, for instance, in the oldest and\r\nlargest Cossack Army, that of the Don, the amount of land secured to an\r\nindividual farm was, on the average, in _dessiateens_: for Cossacks,\r\n19.3 to 30; for native peasants, 6.5; for immigrant peasants, 1.3.\r\nFinally, owing to historical conditions and a narrow territorial system\r\nof recruiting, the Cossack units possessed a perfectly homogeneous\r\npersonnel, a great internal unity, and a discipline which was firm,\r\nthough somewhat peculiar as to the mutual relations between the\r\nofficers and the privates, and therefore they conceded complete\r\nobedience to their chiefs and to the Supreme Power.\r\n\r\nWith the support of all these motives, the Government made a wide use\r\nof Cossack troops for suppressing popular agitation, and thus roused\r\nagainst them the mute exasperation of the fermenting, discontented\r\nmasses of the population.\r\n\r\nIn return for their historical \"liberties,\" the Cossack Armies, as I\r\nhave said, give all but universal military service. Its burden and the\r\ndegree of relative importance of these troops among the armed forces of\r\nthe Russian Empire are shown in the following table:\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION OF THE COSSACK TROOPS IN THE AUTUMN OF 1913.\r\n\r\n ---------------+------------+---------------+-------------\r\n    Armies.     |  Cavalry   |  Sotnias not  |  Infantry\r\n                | Regiments. |   included    | Battalions.\r\n                |            | in Regiments. |\r\n ---------------+------------+---------------+-------------\r\n  Don           |     60     |      72       |     --\r\n  Kouban        |     37     |      37       |     22\r\n  Orenburg      |     18     |      40       |     --\r\n  Terek         |     12     |       3       |      2\r\n  Ural          |      9     |       4       |     --\r\n  Siberian      |      9     |       3       |     --\r\n  Trans-Baikal  |      9     |      --       |     --\r\n  Semiretchensk |      3     |       7       |     --\r\n  Astrakhan     |      3     |      --       |     --\r\n  Amur          |      2     |       5       |     --\r\n ---------------+------------+---------------+-------------\r\n  TOTAL[32]     |    162     |     171       |     24\r\n ---------------+------------+---------------+-------------\r\n\r\nPartly as cavalry of the line--in divisions and corps, partly as Army\r\ncorps and divisional cavalry--in regiments, sub-divisions and detached\r\n_sotnias_, the Cossack units were scattered over all the Russian\r\nfronts, from the Baltic to Persia. _Among the Cossacks, as against all\r\nthe other component parts of the Army, desertion was unknown._\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of Revolution all the political groups, and even\r\nthe representatives of the Allies, devoted great attention to the\r\nCossacks--some building exaggerated hopes on them, others regarding\r\nthem with unconcealed suspicion. The circles of the Right looked to the\r\nCossacks for Restoration; the Liberal Bourgeoisie, for active support\r\nof law and order; while the parties of the Left feared that they were\r\ncounter-Revolutionary, and therefore started a strong propaganda in\r\nthe Cossack units, seeking to disintegrate them. This was to some\r\nextent assisted by the spirit of repentance which showed itself at\r\nall Cossack meetings, Congresses, \"Circles\" and \"Radas\" at which the\r\nlate power was accused of systematically rousing the Cossacks against\r\nthe people. The mutual relations between the Cossacks and the local\r\nagricultural population were unusually complicated, especially in\r\nthe Cossack territories of European Russia.[33] Intermingled with\r\nthe Cossack allotments were peasant lands--those of whilom settlers\r\n(the indigenous peasantry)--lands let on long lease, on which large\r\nsettlements had sprung up, finally lands which had been granted by the\r\nEmperor to various persons and which had gradually passed into the\r\nhands of \"outsiders.\" On the basis of these mutual relations dissension\r\nnow arose which began to assume the character of violence and forcible\r\nseizures. With respect to the Don Army, which gave the keynote to\r\nall others, the Provisional Government considered it necessary to\r\npublish on April 7th an appeal in which, while affirming that \"the\r\nrights of the Cossacks to the land, as they have grown historically,\r\nremain inviolable,\" also promised the \"outsider\" population, \"whose\r\nclaim to the land is also based on historical rights,\" that it would\r\nbe satisfied, in as great a measure as possible, by the Constituent\r\nAssembly. This agrarian puzzle, which surrounded with uncertainty the\r\nmost tender point of the Cossacks' hopes, was explained unequivocally,\r\nin the middle of May, by the Minister of Agriculture, Tchernov (at the\r\nAll-Russia Peasant Congress), who stated that the Cossacks held large\r\ntracts of land and that now they would have to surrender a portion of\r\ntheir lands.\r\n\r\nIn the Cossack territories meanwhile work was in full swing in the\r\nsphere of self-determination and self-government; the information\r\nsupplied by the Press was vague and contradictory; no one had yet heard\r\nthe voice of the Cossacks as a whole. One can understand, therefore,\r\nthat general attention which was concentrated on the All-Russia Cossack\r\nCongress, which gathered in Petrograd in the beginning of June.\r\n\r\nThe Cossacks paid a tribute to the Revolution and to the State,\r\nreferred to their own needs (after all, the question of their holdings\r\nwas the most vital one), and ... smiled to the Soviet....\r\n\r\nThe impression thus produced was indefinite; neither were the hopes of\r\nthe one side fulfilled nor the fears of the other dissipated.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, at the initiative of the Revolutionary Democracy, a violent\r\npropaganda was set on foot for introducing the idea of doing away with\r\nthe Cossacks as a separate caste. But, on the whole, this idea of\r\nself-abolition had no success. On the contrary, a growing aspiration\r\nspread among the Cossacks for maintaining their internal organisation\r\nand for the union of all the Cossack Armies.\r\n\r\nCossack Governments sprang up everywhere, elected Hetmans and\r\nrepresentative institutions (\"Circles\" and Radas), whose authority\r\nincreased in accordance with the weakening of the authority and power\r\nof the Provisional Government. Such eminent men appeared at the head\r\nof the Cossacks as Kaledin (the Don), Doutov (Orenburg), and Karaoulov\r\n(the Terek).\r\n\r\nA triple power was formed in the Cossack territories; the Hetman with\r\nhis Government, the commissary of the Provisional Government, and the\r\nSoviet.[34]\r\n\r\nThe Commissaries, however, after a short and unsuccessful struggle,\r\nsoon subsided and exhibited no activity. Far more serious became\r\nthe struggle of the Cossack authority with the local Soviets and\r\nCommittees, which sought support in the unruly mob of soldiers who\r\nflooded the territories under the name of Reserve Army Battalions and\r\nRear Army Units. This curse of the population positively terrorised\r\nthe land, creating anarchy in the towns and settlements, instituting\r\nsacks, seizing lands and businesses, trampling upon all rights, all\r\nauthority, and creating intolerable conditions of life. The Cossacks\r\nhad nothing with which to combat this violence--all their units were at\r\nthe Front. Only in the Don territory, accidentally, in the autumn of\r\n1917, not without the deliberate connivance of the Stavka, a division\r\nwas concentrated, and afterwards three divisions, with the aid of which\r\nGeneral Kaledin attempted to restore order.\r\n\r\nBut all the measures taken by him, as for instance the occupation by\r\narmed forces of railway junctions, of the more important mines, and of\r\nlarge centres, which secured normal communication and supplies for the\r\ncentre and the fronts, were met not only with violent resistance on the\r\npart of the Soviets and with accusations of counter-revolutionism, but\r\neven with some suspicion on the part of the Provisional Government. At\r\nthe same time the Cossacks of the Kouban and of the Terek asked the Don\r\nto send them if only a few _sotnias_, as it was \"becoming impossible to\r\nbreathe for _comrades_.\"\r\n\r\nThe friendly relations, instituted in the early days of the Revolution,\r\nbetween the general Russian and the Cossack Revolutionary Democracies\r\nwere soon broken off finally. \"Cossack Socialism\" turned out to be\r\nso self-sufficing, so concentrated in its own castes and corporation\r\nlimits, that it could find no place in that doctrine.\r\n\r\nThe Soviets insisted on the equalising of the holdings of the Cossacks\r\nand the peasants, while the Cossacks vigorously defended their right\r\nof property and disposal in the Cossack lands, basing it on their\r\nhistorical merits as conquerors, protectors, and colonisers of the\r\nformer marches of Russia's territory.\r\n\r\nThe organisation of a general territorial Government failed. An\r\ninternecine struggle began.\r\n\r\nThe consequences were two-fold: The first was a painful atmosphere of\r\nestrangement and hostility between the Cossacks and the \"outsider\"\r\npopulation, which later, in the swiftly changing kaleidoscope of the\r\ncivil war, sometimes assumed monstrous forms of mutual extermination,\r\nas the power passed from the hands of one side into those of the\r\nother. Along with this, one or the other half of the population of the\r\nlarger Cossack territories were generally deemed as participating in\r\nthe building up and the economy of the land.[35] The second was the\r\nso-called Cossack separatism or self-determination.\r\n\r\nThe Cossacks had no reason to expect from the Revolutionary Democracy\r\na favourable settlement of their destiny, especially in the question\r\nmost vital to it--the land question. On the other hand, the Provisional\r\nGovernment had also assumed an ambiguous attitude in this matter, and\r\nthe Government power was openly tending to its fall. The future assumed\r\naltogether indefinite outlines. Hence, independently of the general\r\nhealthy aspiration towards decentralisation, there appeared among the\r\nCossacks, who for centuries had been seeking \"freedom,\" a tendency\r\nthemselves to secure the maximum of independence, so as to place the\r\nfuture Constituent Assembly before an accomplished fact, or as the\r\nmore outspoken Cossack leaders put it, \"that there should be something\r\nfrom which to knock off.\" Hence a gradual evolution from territorial\r\nself-government to autonomy, federation, and confederation. Hence,\r\nfinally--with the intrusion of individual local self-love, ambition,\r\nand interests--a permanent struggle began with every principle of an\r\nimperial tendency, a struggle which weakened both sides and greatly\r\nprolonged the civil war.[36] It was these circumstances, too, that gave\r\nbirth to the idea of an independent Cossack army, which first arose\r\namong the Cossacks of the Kouban and was not then supported by Kaledin\r\nand the more imperialistic elements of the Don.\r\n\r\nAll that I have related refers mainly to the three Cossack bodies (the\r\nDon, the Kouban, and the Terek) which form more than sixty per cent.\r\nof Cossack-dom. But the general characteristic features belong to the\r\nother Cossack armies as well.\r\n\r\nAlong with the alterations in the composition of the Provisional\r\nGovernment and with the decline of its authority, changes took place\r\nin the attitude toward it of Cossack-dom, expressing themselves\r\nin the resolutions and appeals of the Council of the union of the\r\nCossack armies, of the hetmans, circles, and Governments. If before\r\nJuly the Cossacks voted for all possible support to the Government\r\nand for complete obedience, later, however, _while acknowledging the\r\nauthority of the Government to the very end_, it comes forward in\r\nsharp opposition to it on the questions of the organisation of the\r\nCossack administration and _zemstvo_, of the employment of Cossacks\r\nfor the repression of rebellious troops and districts and so forth. In\r\nOctober the Kouban rada assumes constituent powers and publishes the\r\nconstitution of the \"Kouban territory.\" It speaks of the Government in\r\nsuch a manner as the following: \"When will the Provisional Government\r\nshake off these fumes (the Bolshevist aggression) and put an end, by\r\nresolute measures, to these scandals?\"\r\n\r\nThe Provisional Government, being already without authority and without\r\nany real power, surrendered all its positions and agreed to peace with\r\nthe Cossack Governments.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that, even at the end of October, when, owing to the\r\nbreach of communications, no correct information had yet been received\r\non the Don about the events in Petrograd and Moscow and about the fate\r\nof the Provisional Government, and when it was supposed that its\r\nfragments were functioning somewhere or other, the Cossack elders, in\r\nthe person of the representatives of the South-Eastern Union, then\r\ngathering,[37] sought to get into touch with the Government, offering\r\nit aid against the Bolsheviks, but conditioning this aid with a whole\r\nseries of economic demands: a non-interest-bearing loan of 500,000,000\r\nroubles, the State to pay all the expenses of supporting Cossack units\r\noutside the territory of the union, the institution of a pension fund\r\nfor all sufferers, and the right of the Cossacks to all \"spoils of\r\nwar\"(?) which might be taken in the course of the coming civil war.\r\n\r\nIt is not without interest that for a long time Pourishkevitch\r\ncherished the idea of the transfer of the State Duma to the Don, as a\r\ncounterpoise to the Provisional Government and for the preservation of\r\nthe source of authority, in case of the fall of the latter. Kaledin's\r\nattitude towards this proposal was negative.\r\n\r\nA characteristic indication of the attitude which the Cossacks had\r\nsucceeded in retaining towards themselves in the most varied circles\r\nwas that attraction to the Don which later, in the winter of 1917,\r\nled thitherward Rodzianko, Miliukov, General Alexeiev, the Bykhov\r\nprisoners, Savinkov, and even Kerensky, who came to General Kaledin, in\r\nNovotcherkassk, in the latter days of November, but was not received by\r\nhim. Pourishkevitch alone did not come, and that only because he was\r\nthen in prison in Petrograd, in the hands of the Bolsheviks.\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly it turned out that the whole thing was a mystification,\r\npure and simple, that at that time the Cossacks had no power left\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nIn view of the growing disorders on the Cossack territory, the hetmans\r\nrepeatedly appealed for the recall from the front of if only part of\r\nthe Cossack divisions. They were awaited with enormous impatience,\r\nand the most radiant hopes were built on them. In October these hopes\r\nseemed to be on the eve of fulfilment; the Cossack divisions had\r\nstarted for home. Overcoming all manner of obstacles on their way,\r\nretarded at every step by the Vikzhel (All-Russia Executive Railway\r\nCommittee) and the local Soviets, subjected more than once to insults,\r\ndisarmament, resorting in one place to requests, in another to cunning,\r\nand in some places to armed threats, the Cossack units forced their way\r\ninto their territories.\r\n\r\nBut no measures could preserve the Cossack units from the fate which\r\nhad befallen the Army, for the whole of the psychological atmosphere\r\nand all the factors of disruption, internal and external, were\r\nabsorbed by the Cossack masses, perhaps less intensively, but on the\r\nwhole in the same way. The two unsuccessful and, for the Cossacks,\r\nincomprehensible marches on Petrograd, with Krymov[38] and Krasnov,[39]\r\nintroduced still greater confusion into their vague political outlook.\r\n\r\nThe return of the Cossack troops to their homeland brought complete\r\ndisenchantment with it: they--at least the Cossacks of the Don, the\r\nKouban, and the Terek[40]--brought with them from the front the most\r\ngenuine Bolshevism, void, of course, of any kind of ideology, but with\r\nall the phenomena of complete disintegration which we know so well.\r\nThis disintegration ripened gradually, showed itself later, but at\r\nonce exhibiting itself in the denial of the authority of the \"elders,\"\r\nthe negation of all power, by mutiny, violence, the persecution and\r\nsurrender of the officers, but principally by complete abandonment\r\nof any struggle against the Soviet power, which falsely promised the\r\ninviolability of the Cossack rights and organisation. Bolshevism and\r\nthe Cossack organisation! Such grotesque contradictions were brought to\r\nthe surface daily by the reality of Russian life, on the basis of that\r\ndrunken debauch into which its long-desired freedom had degenerated.\r\n\r\nNow began the tragedy of Cossack life and the Cossack family in which\r\nan insurmountable barrier had arisen between the \"elders\" and the \"men\r\nof the front,\" destroying their life and rousing the children against\r\ntheir fathers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL UNITS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the old Russian Army the national question scarcely existed. Among\r\nthe soldiery the representatives of the races inhabiting Russia\r\nexperienced somewhat greater hardships in the service, caused by their\r\nignorance or imperfect knowledge of the Russian language, in which\r\ntheir training was carried on. It was only this ground--the technical\r\ndifficulties of training--and perhaps that of general roughness and\r\nbarbarism, but in no case that of racial intolerance, that often led to\r\nthat friction, which made the position of the alien elements difficult,\r\nthe more so that, according to the system of mixed drafting, they\r\nwere generally torn from their native lands; the territorial system\r\nof filling the ranks of the Army was considered to be technically\r\nirrational and politically--not void of danger. The Little Russian\r\nquestion in particular did not exist _at all_. The Little Russian\r\nspeech (outside the limits of official training), songs and music\r\nreceived full recognition and did not rouse in anyone any feeling of\r\nseparateness, being accepted as Russian, as one's own. In the Army,\r\nwith the exception of the Jews, all the other alien elements were\r\nabsorbed fairly quickly and permanently; the community of the Army\r\nwas in no way a conductor either for compulsory Russification or for\r\nnational Chauvinism.\r\n\r\nStill less were national differences to be noticed in the community of\r\nofficers. Qualities and virtues--corporative, military, pertaining to\r\ncomradeship or simply human, overshadowed or totally obliterated racial\r\nbarriers. Personally, during my twenty-five years of service before the\r\nrevolution, it never came into my head to introduce this element into\r\nmy relations as commander, as colleague, or as comrade. And this was\r\ndone intuitively, not as the result of certain views and convictions.\r\nThe national questions which _were raised outside the Army_, in the\r\npolitical life of the country, interested me, agitated me, were settled\r\nby me in one or the other direction, harshly and irreconcilably at\r\ntimes, but always without trespassing on the boundaries of military\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe Jews occupied a somewhat different position. I shall return to this\r\nquestion later. But it may be said that, with respect to the old Army,\r\nthis question was of popular rather than of political significance.\r\nIt cannot be denied that in the Army there was a certain tendency to\r\noppress the Jews, but it was not at all a part of any system, was not\r\ninspired from above, but sprang up in the lower strata and in virtue\r\nof complex causes, which spread far outside of the life, customs, and\r\nmutual relations of the military community.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the war overthrew all barriers, while the revolution\r\nbrought with it the repeal, in legislative order, of all religious and\r\nnational restrictions.\r\n\r\nWith the beginning of the revolution and the weakening of the\r\nGovernment, a violent centrifugal tendency arose in the borderlands\r\nof Russia, and along with it a tendency towards the nationalisation,\r\n_i.e._, the dismemberment, of the Army. Undoubtedly, the need of such\r\ndismemberment did not at that time spring from the consciousness\r\nof the masses and had no real foundation (I do not speak of the\r\nPolish formations). The sole motives for nationalisation then lay\r\nin the seeking of the political upper strata of the newly formed\r\ngroups to create a real support for their demands, and in the\r\nfeeling of self-preservation which urged the military element to\r\nseek in new and prolonged formations a temporary or permanent relief\r\nfrom military operations. Endless national military congresses\r\nbegan, without the permission of the Government and of the High\r\nCommand. All races suddenly began to speak; the Lithuanians, the\r\nEsthonians, the Georgians, the White Russians, the Little Russians,\r\nthe Mohammedans--demanding the \"self-determination\" proclaimed--from\r\ncultural national autonomy to full independence inclusive, and\r\nprincipally the immediate formation of separate bodies of troops.\r\nFinally, more serious results, undoubtedly negative as regards the\r\nintegrity of the Army, were attained by the Ukrainian, Polish, and\r\npartially by the Trans-Caucasian formations. The other attempts were\r\nnipped in the bud. It was only during the last days of the existence\r\nof the Russian Army, in October, 1917, that General Shcherbatov,\r\nseeking to preserve the Roumanian front, began the classification of\r\nthe Army, on a large scale, according to race--an attempt which ended\r\nin complete failure. I must add that one race only made no demand\r\nfor self-determination with regard to military service--the Jewish.\r\nAnd whenever a proposal was made from any source--in reply to the\r\ncomplaints of the Jews--to organise special Jewish regiments, this\r\nproposal roused a storm of indignation among the Jews and in the\r\ncircles of the Left, and was stigmatised as deliberate provocation.\r\n\r\nThe Government showed itself markedly opposed to the reorganisation\r\nof the Army according to race. In a letter to the Polish Congress\r\n(June 1st, 1917) Kerensky expressed the following view: \"The great\r\nachievement of the liberation of Russia and Poland can be arrived at\r\nonly under the condition that the organism of the Russian Army is\r\nnot weakened, that no alterations in its organisation infringe its\r\nunity.... The extrusion from it of racial troops ... would, at this\r\ndifficult moment, tear its body, break its power, and spell ruin both\r\nfor the revolution and for the freedom of Russia, Poland, and of the\r\nother nationalities inhabiting Russia.\"\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the commanding element towards the question of\r\nnationalisation was dual. The majority was altogether opposed to\r\nit; the minority regarded it with some hope that, by breaking their\r\nconnection with the Council of Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates, the\r\nnewly created national units might escape the errors and infatuations\r\nof democratisation and become a healthy nucleus for fortifying the\r\nfront and building up the army. General Alexeiev resolutely opposed\r\nall attempts at nationalisation, but encouraged the Polish and\r\nTchekho-Slovak formations. General Brussilov allowed the creation\r\nof the first Ukrainian formation on his own responsibility, after\r\nrequesting the Supreme Commander-in-Chief \"not to repeal it and not\r\nto undermine his authority thereby.\"[41] The regiment was allowed to\r\nexist. General Ruzsky, also without permission, began the Esthonian\r\nformations,[42] and so forth. From the same motives, probably, which\r\nled some commanders to allow formations, but with a reverse action,\r\nthe whole of the Russian revolutionary democracy, in the person of the\r\nSoviets and the army committees, rose against the nationalisation of\r\nthe Army. A shower of violent resolutions poured in from all sides.\r\nAmong others, the Kiev Council of Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates,\r\nabout the middle of April, characterised Ukrainisation in rude and\r\nindignant language, as simple desertion and \"hide-saving,\" and by\r\na majority of 264 against 4 demanded the repeal of the formation\r\nof Ukrainian regiments. It is interesting to note that as great an\r\nopponent of nationalisation was found in the Polish \"Left,\" which had\r\nsplit off from the military congress of the Poles in June, because of\r\nthe resolution for the formation of Polish troops.\r\n\r\nThe Government did not long adhere to its original firm decision\r\nagainst nationalisation. The declaration of July 2nd, along with\r\nthe grant of autonomy to the Ukraine, also decided the question of\r\nnationalising the troops: \"The Government considers it possible to\r\ncontinue its assistance to a closer national union of the Ukrainians\r\nin the ranks of the Army itself, or to the drafting into individual\r\nunits of Ukrainians exclusively, in so far as such a measure does not\r\ninjure the fighting capacity of the Army ... and considers it possible\r\nto attract to the fulfilment of those tasks the Ukrainian soldiers\r\nthemselves, who are sent by the Central Rada to the War Ministry, the\r\nGeneral Staff, and the Stavka.\"\r\n\r\nA great \"migration of peoples\" began.\r\n\r\nOther Ukrainian agents journeyed along the front, organising Ukrainian\r\n_gromadas_ and committees, getting resolutions passed for transfers\r\nto Ukrainian units, or concerning reluctance to go to the front under\r\nthe plea that \"the Ukraine was being stifled\" and so forth. By October\r\nthe Ukrainian committee of the Western front was already calling for\r\narmed pressure on the Government for the immediate conclusion of\r\npeace. Petlura affirmed that he had 50,000 Ukrainian troops at his\r\ndisposal. Yet the commander of the Kiev military district, Colonel\r\nOberoutchev,[43] bears witness as follows: \"At the time when heroic\r\nexertions were being made to break the foe (the June advance) _I was\r\nunable to send a single soldier to reinforce the active army_. As\r\nsoon as I gave an order to some reserve regiment or other to send\r\ndetachments to reinforce the front, a meeting would be called by a\r\nregiment which had until then lived, peaceably, without thinking of\r\nUkrainisation, the yellow and blue Ukrainian flag would be unfurled and\r\nthe cry raised: 'Let us march under the Ukrainian flag!'\r\n\r\n\"And after that they would not move. Weeks would pass, a month, but the\r\ndetachments would not stir, either under the red, or under the blue and\r\nyellow flag.\"\r\n\r\nWas it possible to combat this unconcealed care for their own safety?\r\nThe answer is given by Oberoutchev again--an answer very characteristic\r\nin its lifeless party rigour:\r\n\r\n\"Of course, I could have used force to get my orders obeyed. And that\r\nforce lay in my hands.\" But \"by using force against the disobedient,\r\nwho are acting under the Ukrainian flag, one risks the reproach\r\nthat one is struggling not against acts of anarchy, but against\r\nnational freedom and the self-determination of nations. And for me, a\r\nSocialist-Revolutionary, to risk such a reproach, and in the Ukraine\r\ntoo, with which I had been connected all my life, was impossible. And\r\nso I decided to resign.\"[44]\r\n\r\nAnd he resigned. True, it was only in October, shortly before the\r\nBolshevist _coup d'état_, having occupied the post of commander of the\r\ntroops in the most important district next the front for nearly five\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nAs a development of the orders of the Government, the Stavka appointed\r\nspecial divisions on each front for Ukrainisation, and on the\r\nSouth-Western front also the 34th Army Corps, which was under the\r\ncommand of General Skoropadsky. To these units, which were mostly\r\nquartered in the deep reserve, the soldiers flocked from the whole\r\nfront, without leave asked or given. The hopes of the optimists on\r\nthe one hand and the fears of the Left circles on the other that\r\nnationalisation would create \"firm units\" (counter-revolutionary in the\r\nterminology of the Left) were speedily dispersed. The new Ukrainian\r\ntroops were permeated with the same elements of disintegration as the\r\nregulars.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, among the officers and old soldiers of many famous regiments\r\nwith a great historical past, now transformed into Ukrainian units,\r\nthis measure roused acute pain and the recognition that the end\r\nof the Army was near.[45] In August, when I was in command of the\r\nSouth-Western front, bad news began to come to me from the 34th Army\r\nCorps. The corps seemed to be escaping from direct subordination,\r\nreceiving both directions and reinforcements from the \"General\r\nSecretary Petlura\" directly. His commissary was attached to the Staff\r\nof the corps, over which waved the \"yellow-blue flag.\" The former\r\nRussian officers and sergeants, left in the regiments because there was\r\nno Ukrainian command, were treated with contumely by the often ignorant\r\nUkrainian ensigns set over them and by the soldiers. An extremely\r\nunhealthy atmosphere of mutual hostility and estrangement was gathering\r\nin these units.\r\n\r\nI sent for General Skoropadsky and invited him to moderate the violent\r\ncourse of the process of Ukrainisation and, in particular, either to\r\nrestore the rights of the Commanders or to release them from service\r\nin the corps. The future Hetman declared that a mistaken idea had been\r\nformed of his activity, probably because of the historical past of the\r\nSkoropadsky family,[46] that he was a true Russian, an officer of the\r\nGuards and was altogether free of all seeking for self-determination,\r\nthat he was only obeying orders, for which he himself had no sympathy.\r\nBut immediately afterwards Skoropadsky went to the Stavka, whence my\r\nStaff received directions to aid the speedy Ukrainisation of the 34th\r\nArmy Corps.\r\n\r\nThe question of the Polish formations was in a somewhat different\r\nposition. The Provisional Government had declared the independence\r\nof Poland, and the Poles now counted themselves \"foreigners\"; Polish\r\nformations had long ago existed on the South-Western front, though they\r\nwere breaking up (with the exception of the Polish Lancers); having\r\ngiven permission to the Ukrainians, the Government could not refuse it\r\nto the Poles. Finally, the Central Powers, by creating the appearance\r\nof Polish independence, also had in view the formation of a Polish\r\nArmy, which, however, ended in failure. America also formed a Polish\r\nArmy on French territory.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1917, the formation of a Polish corps was assigned to the\r\nWestern front, of which I was then Commander-in-Chief. At the head of\r\nthe corps I put General Dovbor-Mousnitsky,[47] who is now in command\r\nof the Polish Army at Poznan. A strong, energetic, resolute man, who\r\nfearlessly waged war on the disintegration of the Russian troops and\r\non the Bolshevism among them, he succeeded in a short time in creating\r\nunits which, if not altogether firm, were, in any case, strikingly\r\ndifferent from the Russian troops in their discipline and order. It\r\nwas the old discipline, rejected by the Revolution--without meetings,\r\ncommissaries or committees. Such units roused another attitude towards\r\nthem in the Army, notwithstanding the rejection of nationalisation in\r\nprinciple. Being supplied with the property of the disbanded mutinous\r\ndivisions and treated with complaisance by the Chief of Supplies, the\r\ncorps was soon able to organise its own commissariat. By order, the\r\nranks of the officers in the Polish corps were filled by the transfer\r\nof those who desired it, and the ranks of the soldiers--exclusively\r\nby volunteers or from reserve battalions; practically, however, the\r\ninevitable current from the front set in, caused by the same motives\r\nwhich influenced the Russian soldiers, devastating the thinned ranks of\r\nthe Army.\r\n\r\nIn the end the Polish formations turned out to be altogether useless to\r\nus. Even at the June military congress of the Poles, fairly unanimous\r\nand unambiguous speeches were heard which defined the aims of these\r\nformations. Their synthesis was thus expressed by one of the delegates:\r\n\"It is a secret for no one that the War is coming to an end, and we\r\nneed the Polish Army, not for the War, not for fighting; we need it so\r\nthat at the coming international conference we may be reckoned with,\r\nthat there should be power at our backs.\"\r\n\r\nAnd indeed the corps did not make its appearance at the front--it is\r\ntrue that it was not yet finally formed; it did not wish to interfere\r\nin the \"home affairs\" of the Russians (October and later--the struggle\r\nagainst Bolshevism) and soon assumed completely the position of \"a\r\nforeign army,\" being taken over and supported by the French command.\r\n\r\nBut neither were the hopes of the Polish nationalists fulfilled. In the\r\nmidst of the general break-down and fall of the front in the beginning\r\nof 1918 and after the irruption of the Germans into Russia, part of the\r\ncorps was captured and disarmed, part of it dispersed and the remnants\r\nof the Polish troops afterwards found a hospitable asylum in the ranks\r\nof the Volunteer Army.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I cannot but say a good word for the 1st Polish Corps, to\r\nthe units of which, quartered in Bykhov, we owe much in the protection\r\nof the lives of General Kornilov and the other Bykhov prisoners, in the\r\nmemorable days of September to November.\r\n\r\nCentrifugal forces were scattering the country and the Army. To\r\nclass and party intolerance was added the embitterment of national\r\ndissensions, partly based on the historically-created relations between\r\nthe races inhabiting Russia and the Imperial Government, and partly\r\naltogether baseless, absurd, fed by causes which had nothing in common\r\nwith healthy national feeling. Latent or crushed at an earlier date,\r\nthese dissensions broke out rudely at just that moment, unfortunately,\r\nwhen the general Russian authority was voluntarily and conscientiously\r\ntaking the path of recognition of the historical rights and the\r\nnational cultural self-determination of the component elements of the\r\nRussian State.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: General Alexeiev's (centre) farewell.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n    MAY AND THE BEGINNING OF JUNE IN THE SPHERE OF MILITARY\r\n    ADMINISTRATION--THE RESIGNATION OF GUTCHKOV AND GENERAL\r\n    ALEXEIEV--MY DEPARTURE FROM THE STAVKA--THE ADMINISTRATION OF\r\n    KERENSKY AND GENERAL BRUSSILOV.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn May 1st the Minister of War, Gutchkov, left his post. \"We wished,\"\r\nso he explained the meaning of the \"democratisation\" of the Army which\r\nhe tried to introduce, \"to give organised forms and certain channels to\r\nfollow, to that awakened spirit of independence, self-help and liberty\r\nwhich had swept over all. But there is a line, beyond which lies the\r\nbeginning of the ruin of that living, mighty organism which is the\r\nArmy.\" Undoubtedly that line was crossed even before the first of May.\r\n\r\nI am not preparing to characterise Gutchkov, whose sincere patriotism\r\nI do not doubt. I am speaking only of the system. It is difficult to\r\ndecide who could have borne the heavy weight of administering the Army\r\nduring the first period of the Revolution; but, in any case, Gutchkov's\r\nMinistry had not the slightest grounds to seek the part of guiding the\r\nlife of the Army. It did not lead the Army. On the contrary, submitting\r\nto a \"parallel power\" and impelled from below, the Ministry, somewhat\r\nrestively, _followed the Army_, until it came right up to the line,\r\nbeyond which final ruin begins.\r\n\r\n\"To restrain the Army from breaking up completely under the influence\r\nof that pressure which proceeded from the Socialists, and in particular\r\nfrom their citadel--the Soviet of Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates--to\r\ngain time, to allow the diseased process to be absorbed, to help the\r\nhealthy elements to gain strength, such was my aim,\" wrote Gutchkov to\r\nKornilov in June, 1917. The whole question is whether the resistance\r\nto the destroying powers was resolute enough. The Army did not feel\r\nthis. The officers read the orders, signed by Gutchkov, which broke\r\nup completely the foundations of military life and custom. That these\r\norders were the result of a painful internal drama, a painful struggle\r\nand defeat--this the officers did not know, nor did it interest them.\r\nTheir lack of information was so great that many of them even now,\r\nfour years later, ascribe to Gutchkov the authorship of the celebrated\r\n\"Order No. 1.\" However it may be, the officers felt themselves deceived\r\nand deserted. Their difficult position they ascribed principally to the\r\nreforms of the Minister of War, against whom a hostile feeling arose,\r\nheated still more by the grumbling of hundreds of Generals removed by\r\nhim and of the ultra-monarchical section of the officers, who could not\r\nforgive Gutchkov his supposed share in the preparation of the Palace\r\n_coup d'état_ and of the journey to Pskov.[48]\r\n\r\nThus the resignation of this Minister, even if caused \"by those\r\nconditions, in which the Government power was placed in the country,\r\nand in particular the power of the Minister of the Army and the Navy\r\nwith respect to the Army and the fleet,\"[49] had another justification\r\nas well--the want of support among the officers and the soldiery.\r\n\r\nIn a special resolution the Provisional Government condemned Gutchkov's\r\naction in \"resigning responsibility for the fate of Russia,\" and\r\nappointed Kerensky Minister of the Army and the Navy. I do not know how\r\nthe Army received this appointment in the beginning, but the Soviet\r\nreceived it without prejudice. Kerensky was a complete stranger to the\r\nart of war and to military life, but could have been surrounded by\r\nhonest men; what was then going on in the Army was simple insanity,\r\nand this even a civilian might have understood. Gutchkov was a\r\nrepresentative of the Bourgeoisie, a Member of the Right, and was\r\ndistrusted; now, perhaps, a Socialist Minister, the favourite of the\r\nDemocracy, might have succeeded in dissipating the fog in which the\r\nsoldiers' consciousness was wrapped. Nevertheless, to take up such a\r\nburden called for enormous boldness or enormous self-confidence, and\r\nKerensky emphasised this circumstance more than once when speaking\r\nto an Army audience: \"At a time when many soldiers, who had studied\r\nthe art of war for decades, declined the post of Minister of War,\r\nI--a civilian, accepted it.\" No one, however, had ever heard that the\r\nMinistry of War had been offered to a soldier that May.\r\n\r\nThe very first steps taken by the new Minister dissipated our hopes:\r\nthe choice of collaborators, who were even greater opportunists than\r\ntheir predecessors, but void of experience in military administration\r\nand in active service;[50] the surrounding of himself with men from\r\n\"underground\"--perhaps having done very great work in the cause of the\r\nRevolution, but without any comprehension of the life of the Army--all\r\nthis introduced into the actions of the War Ministry a new party\r\nelement, foreign to the military service.\r\n\r\nA few days after his appointment Kerensky issued the Declaration of the\r\nrights of the soldier, thereby predestining the entire course of his\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nOn May 11th the Minister was passing through Moghilev to the Front. We\r\nwere surprised by the circumstance that the passage was timed for 5\r\na.m., and that only the Chief-of-Staff was invited into the train. The\r\nMinister of War seemed to avoid meeting the Supreme Commander-in-Chief.\r\nHis conversation with me was short and touched on details--the\r\nsuppression of some disturbances or other that had broken out at one\r\nof the railway junctions and so forth. The most capital questions of\r\nthe existence of the Army and of the coming advance, the necessity\r\nfor unity in the views of the Government and the Command, the absence\r\nof which was showing itself with such marked clearness--all this,\r\napparently, did not attract the attention of the Minister. Among other\r\nthings, Kerensky passed a few cursory remarks on the inappropriateness\r\nof Generals Gourko and Dragomirov, Commanders-in-Chief of fronts,\r\nto their posts, which drew a protest from me. All this was very\r\nsymptomatic and created at the Stavka a condition of tense, nervous\r\nexpectation.\r\n\r\nKerensky was proceeding to the South-Western front, to begin his\r\ncelebrated verbal campaign which was to rouse the Army to achievement.\r\nThe _word_ created hypnosis and self-hypnosis. Brussilov reported\r\nto the Stavka that throughout the Army the Minister of War had been\r\nreceived with extraordinary enthusiasm. Kerensky spoke with unusual\r\npathos and exaltation, in stirring \"revolutionary\" images, often with\r\nfoam on his lips, reaping the applause and delight of the mob. At\r\ntimes, however, the mob would turn to him the face of a wild beast,\r\nthe sight of which made words to stick in the throat and caused the\r\nheart to fail. They sounded a note of menace, these moments, but fresh\r\ndelight drowned their alarming meaning. And Kerensky reported to\r\nthe Provisional Government that \"the wave of enthusiasm in the Army\r\nis growing and widening,\" and that a definite change in favour of\r\ndiscipline and the regeneration of the Army was displaying itself. In\r\nOdessa he became even more irresistibly poetical: \"In your welcome I\r\nsee that great enthusiasm which has overwhelmed the country and feel\r\nthat great exaltation which the world experiences but once in hundreds\r\nof years.\"\r\n\r\nLet us be just.\r\n\r\nKerensky called on the Army to do its duty. He spoke of duty, honour,\r\ndiscipline, obedience, trust in its commanders; he spoke of the\r\nnecessity for advancing and for victory. He spoke in the language of\r\nthe established revolutionary ritual, which ought to have reached\r\nthe hearts and minds of the \"revolutionary people.\" Sometimes, even,\r\nfeeling his power over his audience, he would throw at it the words,\r\nwhich became household words, of \"rebel slaves\" and \"revolutionary\r\ntyrants.\"\r\n\r\nIn vain!\r\n\r\nAt the conflagration of the temple of Russia, he called to the fire:\r\n\"Be quenched!\" instead of extinguishing it with brimful pails of water.\r\n\r\nWords could not fight against facts, nor heroic poems against the\r\nstern prose of life. The replacement of the Motherland by Liberty and\r\nRevolution did not make the aims of the conflict any clearer. The\r\nconstant scoffing at the old \"discipline,\" at the \"Czar's generals,\"\r\nthe reminders of the knout, the stick, and the \"former unprivileged\r\ncondition of the soldier\" or of the soldier's blood \"shed in vain\" by\r\nsomeone or other--nothing of this could bridge the chasm between the\r\ntwo component parts of the Army. The passionate preaching of a \"new,\r\nconscious, iron revolutionary discipline,\" _i.e._, a discipline based\r\non the \"declaration of the rights of the soldier\"--a discipline of\r\nmeetings, propaganda, political agitation, absence of authority in\r\nthe commanders, and so forth--this preaching was in irreconcileable\r\nopposition to the call to victory. Having received his impressions in\r\nthe artificially exalted, theatrical atmosphere of meetings, surrounded\r\nboth in the Ministry and in his journeyings, by an impenetrable wall of\r\nold political friends and of all manner of delegations and deputations\r\nfrom the Soviets and the Committees, Kerensky looked on the Army\r\nthrough the prism of their outlook, either unwilling or unable to sink\r\nhimself in the real life of the Army and in its torments, sufferings,\r\nsearchings, and crimes, and finally to attain a real standing-ground,\r\nget at vital themes and real words. These everyday questions of Army\r\nlife and organisation--dry in their form and deeply dramatic in their\r\ncontent--never served as themes for his speeches. They contained\r\nonly a glorification of the Revolution and a condemnation of certain\r\nperversions of the idea of national defence, created by that Revolution\r\nitself. The masses of the soldiery, eager for sentimental scenes,\r\nlistened to the appeals of the recognised chief for self-sacrifice,\r\nand they were inflamed with the \"sacred fire\"; but as soon as the\r\nscene was over, both the chief and the audiences reverted to the daily\r\noccupations: the chief--to the \"democratisation\" of the Army, and\r\nthe masses--to \"deepening the Revolution.\" In the same way, probably,\r\nDjerzinsky's executioners in Soviet Russia now admire, in the temple of\r\nproletarian art, the sufferings of young Werther--before proceeding to\r\ntheir customary occupation of hanging and shooting.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, there was much noise. So much, that Hindenburg sincerely\r\nbelieves even to this day that in June, 1917, the South-Western Front\r\nwas commanded by Kerensky. In his book _Aus meinem Leben_ the German\r\nField-Marshal relates that Kerensky succeeded Brussilov, \"who was\r\nswept away from his post by the rivers of Russian blood which he shed\r\nin Galicia and Macedonia (?) in 1916\" (the Field-Marshal has confused\r\nthe theatres of war), and tells the story of Kerensky's \"advance\" and\r\nvictories over the Austrians near Stanislavov.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile life at the Stavka was gradually waning. The wheels of\r\nadministration were still revolving, everybody was doing something,\r\nissuing orders and giving directions. The work was purely formal,\r\nbecause all the plans and directions of the Stavka were upset by\r\nunavoidable and incalculable circumstances. Petrograd never took the\r\nStavka into serious account, but at that time the attitude of the\r\nGovernment was somewhat hostile, and the War Ministry was conducting\r\nthe work of reorganisation without ever consulting the Stavka. This\r\nposition was a great burden to General Alexeiev, the more so that the\r\nattacks of his old disease became more frequent. He was extremely\r\npatient and disregarded all personal pin-pricks and all efforts at\r\nundermining his prerogatives which emanated from the Government.\r\nIn his discussions with numerous Army chiefs, and organisations\r\nwhich took advantage of his accessibility, he was likewise patient,\r\nstraightforward, and sincere. He worked incessantly, in order to\r\npreserve the remnants of the Army. Seeking to give an example of\r\ndiscipline, he protested but obeyed. He was not sufficiently strong\r\nand masterful by nature to compel the Provisional Government and the\r\ncivilian reformers of the Army to take the demands of the Supreme\r\nCommand into account; at the same time, he never did violence to his\r\nconscience in order to please the powers that be or the mob.\r\n\r\nOn May 20th, Kerensky stopped for a few hours at Moghilev on his way\r\nhome from the South-Western Front. He was full of impressions, praised\r\nBrussilov, and expressed the view that the general spirit at the front\r\nand the relations between officers and men were excellent. Although\r\nin his conversation with Alexeiev Kerensky made no hint, we noticed\r\nthat his entourage was somewhat uneasy, and realised that decisions in\r\nregard to certain changes had already been taken. I did not consider\r\nit necessary to acquaint the Supreme Commander-in-Chief with these\r\nrumours, and merely seized the first opportunity for postponing his\r\nintended visit to the Western Front so as not to put him into a false\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nIn the night of the 22nd a telegram was received dismissing General\r\nAlexeiev and appointing General Brussilov by order of the Provisional\r\nGovernment. The Quartermaster-General Josephovitch woke up Alexeiev\r\nand handed him the telegram. The Supreme Commander-in-Chief was\r\ndeeply moved, and tears came down his cheeks. May the members of the\r\nProvisional Government who are still alive forgive the vulgarity\r\nof the language: in a subsequent conversation with me the Supreme\r\nCommander-in-Chief inadvertently uttered the following words: \"The\r\ncads! They have dismissed me like a servant without notice.\"\r\n\r\nA great statesman and military leader had thus left the stage, whose\r\nvirtue--one of many--was his implicit loyalty (or was it a defect?) to\r\nthe Provisional Government.\r\n\r\nOn the next day Kerensky was asked--at a meeting of the Soviet--what\r\nsteps he had taken in view of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief's speech\r\nat the officers' Conference (see Chapter XXIII). He replied that\r\nAlexeiev had been dismissed, and that he, Kerensky, believed that a\r\nlate French politician was right in saying that \"discipline of duty\"\r\nshould be introduced from the top. The Bolshevik Rosenfeldt (Kamenev)\r\nexpressed satisfaction, because this decision fully coincided with\r\nthe repeated demands of the Soviet. On the same day the Government\r\npublished an official communiqué to the effect that: \"In spite of\r\nthe fact that General Alexeiev was naturally very tired and needed\r\nrest from his arduous labours, it was considered impossible to lose\r\nthe services of this exceptionally experienced and talented leader,\r\nand General Alexeiev was therefore to remain at the disposal of the\r\nProvisional Government.\" The Supreme Commander-in-Chief issued the\r\nfollowing Order of the Day as a farewell to the Armies.\r\n\r\n\"For nearly three years I have walked with you along the thorny path\r\nof the Russian Army. Your glorious deeds have filled me with joyful\r\nelation, and I was filled with sorrow in the days of our reverses.\r\nBut I continued with implicit hope in Providence, in the mission of\r\nthe Russian people, and in the prowess of the Russian soldier. Now\r\nthat the foundations of our military power are shattered, I still\r\npreserve the same faith, as life would not be worth living without it.\r\nI reverently salute you, my comrades in arms, all those who have done\r\ntheir duty faithfully, all those whose hearts beat with the love of\r\ntheir country, all those who in the days of the popular turmoil were\r\ndetermined not to allow the Mother Country to be disrupted. I, the old\r\nsoldier, and your late Supreme Commander-in-Chief, once more reverently\r\nsalute you. Pray think kindly of me.\"\r\n\r\n                                              (Signed) GENERAL ALEXEIEV.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of our work in common my intercourse with General\r\nAlexeiev was one of cordial friendship. In parting with me, he said:\r\n\"All this structure will undoubtedly soon collapse. You will have to\r\nresume work once again. Would you then agree to work with me again?\" I\r\nnaturally expressed my readiness to collaborate in the future.\r\n\r\nBrussilov's appointment signified definite elimination of the Stavka,\r\nas a decisive factor, and a change in its direction. Brussilov's\r\nunrestrained and incomprehensible opportunism, and his endeavour to\r\ngain the reputation of a revolutionary, deprived the Commanding Staffs\r\nof the Army of the moral support which the former Stavka still gave\r\nthem. The new Supreme Commander-in-Chief was given a very frigid and\r\ndry reception at Moghilev. Instead of the customary enthusiastic\r\novation to which the \"Revolutionary General\" had been accustomed,\r\nwhom the mob had carried shoulder high at Kamenetz-Podolsk, he found\r\na lonely railway station and a strictly conventional parade. Faces\r\nwere sulky and speeches were stereotyped. Brussilov's first steps,\r\ninsignificant but characteristic episodes, had a further disheartening\r\neffect. As he was reviewing the Guard of Honour of men with the Cross\r\nof St. George, he did not greet their gallant wounded Commander,\r\nColonel Timanovsky, or the officers, but shook hands with the men--the\r\nmessenger and the orderly. They were so much perturbed by the\r\nunexpected inconvenience of such greetings on parade that they dropped\r\ntheir rifles. Brussilov handed to me his Order of the Day intended as a\r\ngreeting to the Armies, which he had written in his own hand, and asked\r\nme to send it to Kerensky for approval. In his speech to the members of\r\nthe Stavka, who had foregathered to bid farewell to General Alexeiev,\r\nBrussilov tried to make excuses. For excuses they were--his confused\r\nexplanations of the sin of \"deepening the Revolution\" with Kerensky\r\nand \"democratising\" the Army with the Committees. The closing sentence\r\nof his Order, addressed to the retiring Chief, sounded, therefore, out\r\nof tune: \"Your name will always remain unstained and pure as that of a\r\nman who has worked incessantly and has given himself entirely to the\r\nservice of the Army. In the dark days of the past and in the present\r\nturmoil you have had the courage, resolutely and loyally, to oppose\r\nviolence, to combat mendacity, flattery, subservience, to resist\r\nanarchy in the country and disruption in the ranks of its defenders.\"\r\n\r\nMy activities were disapproved by the Provisional Government as much as\r\nthose of General Alexeiev, and I could not work with Brussilov owing to\r\nfundamental differences of opinion. I presume that during Kerensky's\r\nvisit to the South-Western Front, Brussilov agreed with his suggestion\r\nof appointing General Lukomsky Chief-of-Staff. I was therefore\r\nsurprised at the conversation which took place on the first day of\r\nBrussilov's arrival. He said to me: \"Well, General, I thought I was\r\ngoing to meet a comrade-in-arms and that we were going to work together\r\nat the Stavka, but you look very surly.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not quite true. I cannot stay at the Stavka any longer. I also\r\nknow that General Lukomsky is to supersede me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What? How have they dared to appoint him without my knowledge?\"\r\n\r\nWe never touched upon that subject again. I continued to work with\r\nBrussilov for about ten days pending my successor's arrival, and I must\r\nconfess that work was unpleasant from the moral point of view. From\r\nthe very first days of the War Brussilov and I had served together.\r\nFor the first month I was Quartermaster-General on the Staff of his\r\nEighth Army, then for two years in command of the 4th Rifle Division\r\nin that same glorious Army, and Commander of the 8th Army Corps on\r\nhis front. The \"Iron Division\" went from victory to victory, and\r\nBrussilov particularly favoured it and constantly acknowledged its\r\nachievements. His attitude towards the Commander of the Division was\r\ncorrespondingly cordial. I shared with Brussilov many hardships as well\r\nas many unforgettable happy days of military triumphs. And I found it\r\ndifficult to speak to him now, for he was a different man and was so\r\nrecklessly, from the personal point of view--which, after all, did\r\nnot matter--as well as from the point of view of the interests of the\r\nArmy, throwing his reputation to the four winds. When I reported to\r\nhim, every question which might be described as \"un-Democratic,\" but\r\nwas, in reality, an endeavour to maintain the reasonable standard of\r\nefficiency, was invariably negatived. Argument was useless. Brussilov\r\nsometimes interrupted me and said with strong feeling: \"Do you think\r\nthat I am not disgusted at having constantly to wave the Red rag? What\r\ncan I do? Russia is sick, the Army is sick. It must be cured, and I\r\nknow of no other remedy.\"\r\n\r\nThe question of my appointment interested him more than it interested\r\nme. I refused to express any definite desire and said that I would\r\naccept any appointment. Brussilov was negotiating with Kerensky. He\r\nonce said to me, \"_They_ are afraid that if I give you an appointment\r\nat the Front, you will begin to oust the Committees.\" I smiled. \"No, I\r\nwill not appeal to the Committees for help, but will also leave them\r\nalone.\" I attributed no importance to this conversation, which was\r\nconducted almost in jest; but on the same day a telegram was sent to\r\nKerensky, of which the following was the approximate wording: \"I have\r\ntalked it over with Deniken. The obstacles have been removed. I request\r\nthat he be appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Western Front.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Kerensky addressing soldiers' meeting.]\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of August I proceeded to Minsk and took General\r\nMarkov as Chief-of-Staff of the Front. I had no regrets in leaving the\r\nStavka. For two months I had worked like a slave and my outlook had\r\nwidened, but had I achieved anything for the preservation of the Army?\r\nPositive results were nil. There may have been some negative results;\r\nthe process of disruption of the Army had been to a certain extent\r\nstayed. And that is all. One of Kerensky's assistants, afterwards\r\nHigh Commissar, Stankevitch, thus describes my activities: \"Nearly\r\nevery week telegrams were sent to Petrograd (by Deniken) containing\r\nprovocative and harsh criticisms on the new methods in the Army;\r\ncriticisms they were, not advice. Is it possible to advise that\r\nthe Revolution should be cancelled.\" If that was only Stankevitch\r\ndiscussing Denikin it would not matter. But these views were shared by\r\nthe wide circles of the Revolutionary Democracy and referred not to\r\nthe individual, but to all those who \"impersonated the tragedy of the\r\nRussian Army.\" The appreciation must therefore be answered.\r\n\r\nYes, the Revolution could not be cancelled, and what is more, I may\r\nstate that the majority of the Russian officers, with whom I agreed,\r\n_did not wish to cancel the Revolution_. They demanded one thing\r\nonly--that the Army should not be revolutionised from the top. None of\r\nus could give any other advice. And if the Commanding Staffs appeared\r\nto be \"insufficiently tied to the Revolution\" they should have been\r\nmercilessly dismissed and other people--were they but unskilled\r\nartisans in military matters--should have been appointed, and given\r\nfull power and confidence.\r\n\r\nPersonalities do not matter. Alexeiev, Brussilov, Kornilov--represent\r\nperiods and systems. Alexeiev protested. Brussilov submitted. Kornilov\r\nclaimed. In dismissing these men one after another did the Provisional\r\nGovernment have a definite idea, or were they simply distracted to\r\nthe point of convulsion and completely lost in the morass of their\r\nown internal dissensions? Would it not appear that had the order been\r\nchanged in which the links had stood in that chain salvation might have\r\nensued?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nMY TERM AS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF ON THE WESTERN RUSSIAN FRONT.\r\n\r\n\r\nI took over the Command from General Gourko. His removal had already\r\nbeen decided on May 5th, and an Order of the Day had been drafted at\r\nthe War Ministry. Gourko, however, sent a report in which he stated\r\nthat it was impossible for him to remain morally responsible for the\r\narmies under his command in the present circumstances (after the\r\n\"Declaration of the Soldier's Rights\" had been issued). This report\r\nafforded Kerensky an excuse for issuing on May 26th an order relieving\r\nGourko of his post and appointing him to the command of a division. The\r\nmotive was adduced that Gourko was \"not up to the mark,\" and that \"as\r\nthe country was in danger, every soldier should do his duty and not be\r\nan example of weakness to others.\" Also that \"the Commander-in-Chief\r\nenjoys the full confidence of the Government, and should apply all his\r\nenergies to the task of carrying out the intentions of the Government;\r\nto decline to bear the moral responsibility was on General Gourko's\r\npart tantamount to dereliction of duty, which he should have continued\r\nto perform according to his strength and judgment.\" Not to speak of\r\nthe fact that Gourko's dismissal had already been decided, suffice\r\nit to recall similar instances, such as the resignations of Gutchkov\r\nand Miliukov, in order to realise the hypocrisy of these excuses. And\r\nwhat is more--Kerensky himself, during one of the Government crises\r\ncaused by the uncompromising attitude of the \"Revolutionary Democracy,\"\r\nhad threatened to resign, and had stated in writing to his would-be\r\nsuccessor, Nekrassov, that: \"Owing to the impossibility of introducing\r\ninto the Government such elements as were required in the present\r\nexceptional circumstances, he could no longer bear the responsibility\r\nbefore the country according to his conscience and judgment, and\r\nrequested therefore to be relieved of all his duties.\" The papers said\r\nthat he had \"departed from Petrograd.\" On October 28th, as we know,\r\nKerensky fled, abandoning the post of Supreme Commander-in-Chief.\r\n\r\nThe old Commanding Staffs were in a difficult position. I refer not\r\nto men of definite political convictions, but of the average honest\r\nsoldier. They could not follow Kerensky (the system, not the man) and\r\ndestroy with their own hands the edifice which they had themselves\r\nspent their lives in building. They could not resign because the enemy\r\nwas on Russian soil and they would be deserters according to their own\r\nconscience. It was a vicious circle.\r\n\r\nUpon my arrival at Minsk I addressed two large gatherings of members of\r\nthe Staff and departments of the Front, and later the Army Commanders,\r\nand expounded my fundamental views. I did not say much, but stated\r\nclearly that I accepted the Revolution without any reservations. I\r\nconsidered, however, that to \"revolutionise\" the Army was a fatal\r\nprocedure, and that to introduce demagogy into the Army would mean the\r\nruin of the Country. I declared that I would oppose it with all my\r\nmight and invited my collaborators to do the same. I received a letter\r\nfrom General Alexeiev, who wrote: \"Congratulations on your appointment.\r\nRouse them! Make your demands calmly but persistently. I trust that\r\nthe revival will come without coaxing, without red ribbons, without\r\nsonorous and empty phrases. The Army cannot continue as it is now,\r\nfor Russia is being transformed into a multitude of idlers who have\r\nan exaggerated idea of their own importance (value their movements in\r\ngold). I am in heart and in thought with you, with your work and with\r\nyour wishes. God help you.\"\r\n\r\nThe Committee of the Front impersonated at Minsk \"Military Politics.\"\r\nOn the eve of my arrival that semi-Bolshevik organisation had passed a\r\nresolution protesting against an advance and in favour of the struggle\r\nof united democracies against their Governments; this naturally helped\r\nto define my attitude towards that body. I had no direct intercourse\r\nwith the Committee, which \"stewed in its own juice,\" argued the\r\nmatter of preponderant influences of the Social Democratic and Social\r\nRevolutionary factions, passed resolutions which puzzled even the\r\nArmy Committees by their demagogic contents, distributed defeatist\r\npamphlets, and incensed the men against their chiefs. According to the\r\nlaw, the Committees were not responsible and could not be tried. The\r\nCommittee was educating in the same sense the pupils of the \"school\r\nfor agitators,\" who were afterwards to spread these doctrines along\r\nthe Front. I will quote one instance showing the real meaning of these\r\nmanifestations \"of civic indignation and sorrow.\" Pupils of the\r\nschool often appealed to the Chief-of-Staff and sent in \"demands.\"\r\nOn one occasion the demand for an extra pair of boots was couched\r\nin offensive terms. General Markov refused it. On the next day a\r\nresolution was published (in the paper _The Front_, No. 25) of the\r\nConference of Pupils of the School of Agitators to the effect that they\r\nhad personally tested the reluctance of Headquarters to take elective\r\norganisations into account. The pupils declared that the Committee of\r\nthe Front will find in them and in those who sent them full support\r\nagainst \"counter-revolution,\" and even armed assistance.\r\n\r\nWas work in common possible in these circumstances?\r\n\r\nThe idea of the advance was finally, however, accepted by the Committee\r\nof the Front, which demanded that from itself and from Army Committees\r\n\"fighting committees of contact\" be established which would be entitled\r\nto partake in the drafting of plans of operations to control the\r\nCommanding Officers and Headquarters of the advancing troops, etc. I\r\nnaturally refused the request, and a conflict ensued. The War Minister\r\nwas very much perturbed, and sent to Minsk the Chief of his Chancery,\r\nColonel Baronovsky, a young staff officer who prompted Kerensky in\r\nall military matters, and the Commissar Stankevitch, who remained at\r\nthe Western Front for two days, was removed to the Northern Front and\r\nreplaced by Kalinin. Baronovsky's friends afterwards told me that the\r\nquestion of my dismissal had been raised in view of \"friction with\r\nthe Committee of the Front.\" Stankevitch appeased the Committee and\r\n\"fighting committees of contact\" were allowed to take part in the\r\nadvance, but were denied the right of control over the operations and\r\nof assisting in drawing up plans.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf the three Army Commanders at that Front, two were entirely in the\r\nhands of the Committees. As their sectors were inactive, their presence\r\ncould be temporarily tolerated. The advance was to begin on the Front\r\nof the 10th Army, commanded by General Kisselevsky, in the region of\r\nMolodetchno. I inspected the troops and the position, interviewed the\r\nCommanding Officers and addressed the troops. In the preceding chapters\r\nI have recounted impressions, facts, and episodes of the life of the\r\nWestern front. I will, therefore, mention here only a few details. I\r\nsaw the troops on parade. Some units had preserved the appearance and\r\nthe routine of the normal pre-Revolutionary times. These, however, were\r\nexceptions, and were to be found chiefly in the Army Corps of General\r\nDovbor-Mussnitzki, who was persistently and sternly maintaining\r\nthe old discipline. Most of the units, however, were more akin to a\r\ndevastated ants-nest than to an organised unit, although they had\r\nretained a semblance of discipline and drill. After the review I walked\r\ndown the ranks and spoke to the soldiers. I was deeply depressed by\r\ntheir new mental attitude. Their speeches were nought but endless\r\ncomplaints, suspicions and grievances against everyone and everything.\r\nThey complained of all the officers, from the Platoon Commander to the\r\nArmy Corps Commander, complained of the lentil soup, of having to stand\r\nat the Front for ever, of the next regiment of the line, and of the\r\nProvisional Government for being implacably hostile to the Germans. I\r\nwitnessed scenes which I shall not forget till my last hour. In one of\r\nthe Army Corps I asked to be shown the worst unit. I was taken to the\r\n703rd Suram Regiment. We drove up to a huge crowd of unarmed men who\r\nwere standing, sitting, wandering about the plain behind the village.\r\nHaving sold their clothes for cash or for drink, they were dressed in\r\nrags, bare-footed, ragged, unkempt, and seemed to have reached the\r\nutmost limit of physical degradation. I was met by the Divisional\r\nCommander, whose lower lip trembled, and by a Regimental Commander who\r\nhad the face of a condemned man. Nobody gave the order \"Attention!\"\r\nand none of the soldiers rose. The nearest ranks moved towards our\r\nmotor cars. My first impulse was to curse the regiment and turn back.\r\nBut that might have been interpreted as cowardice, so I went into the\r\nthick of the crowd. I stayed there for about an hour. Good Heavens,\r\nwhat was the matter with these men, with the reasonable creature of\r\nGod, with the Russian field-labourer? They were like men possessed,\r\ntheir brain dimmed, their speech stubborn and completely lacking logic\r\nor common-sense; their shrieks were hysterical, full of abuse and foul\r\nswearing. We tried to speak, but the replies were angry and stupid. I\r\nremember that my feelings of indignation as an old soldier receded to\r\nthe background and I merely felt infinitely sorry for these uncouth,\r\nilliterate Russians to whom little was given and of whom little will,\r\ntherefore, be asked. One wished that the leaders of the Revolutionary\r\nDemocracy had been on that plain and had seen and heard everything. One\r\nwished one could have said to them: \"It is not the time to find out who\r\nis guilty, it doesn't matter whether the guilt is ours, yours, of the\r\nbourgeoisie or of autocracy. Give the people education and an 'image of\r\nman' first, and then socialise, nationalise, Communise, if the people\r\nwill then follow you.\"\r\n\r\nThe same Suram Regiment, a few days later, gave a sound thrashing to\r\nSokolov, the man who drafted Order No. 1, the creator of the new\r\nrégime for the Army, because he demanded, in the name of the Soviet,\r\nthat the regiment should do its duty and join in the advance.\r\n\r\nAfter visiting the regiment, in compliance with persistent invitations\r\nfrom a special delegation, I went to a Conference of the 2nd Caucasian\r\nArmy Corps. The members of that Conference had been elected; their\r\ndiscussions were more reasonable and their aims more practical. Among\r\nthe various groups of delegates whom our _aides-de-camp_ had joined,\r\nthe argument was put forward that, as the Commander-in-Chief and all\r\nthe senior Commanding Officers were present, would it not be expedient\r\nto finish them off at once? That would put an end to the advance.\r\n\r\nTo meet the senior Commanding Officer was by no means a consolation.\r\nOne of the Army Corps Commanders led his troops with a firm hand, but\r\nexperienced strong pressure from the Army organisations; another was\r\nafraid to visit his troops. I found the third in a state of complete\r\ncollapse and in tears because someone had passed a vote of censure\r\nupon him: \"And this after forty years' service! I loved the men and\r\nthey loved me, but now they have dishonoured me, and I cannot serve\r\nany longer!\" I had to allow him to retire. In the next room a young\r\nDivisional Commander was already in secret consultation with members\r\nof the Committee, who immediately requested me, in a most peremptory\r\nfashion, to appoint the young General to the command of the Army Corps.\r\n\r\nThe visit left me with a painful impression. Disruption was growing and\r\nmy hopes were waning; and yet one had to continue the work, of which\r\nthere was plenty for all of us. The Western Front lived by theory and\r\nby the experience of others. It had won no striking victories, which\r\nalone can inspire confidence in the methods of warfare, and had no\r\nreal experience in breaking through the defensive line of the enemy.\r\nOne was very often compelled to discuss the general plan, the plan\r\nof artillery attack, and to establish the points of initiative with\r\nthose who were to carry out the general plan. We found the greatest\r\ndifficulty in preparing the plans for storming a position. Owing to\r\ndemoralisation, every movement of troops, every relief, trench digging,\r\nbringing batteries into position, either were not carried out at all,\r\nor else attended by delays, tremendous efforts or persuasion, and\r\nmeetings. Every slightest excuse was made use of in order to avoid\r\npreparations for the advance. Owing to the technical unpreparedness\r\nof the positions, the chiefs had to perform the arduous and unnatural\r\ntask of making tactical considerations subservient to the qualities\r\nof the Commanding Officers, instead of giving directions to the\r\ntroops in accordance with tactical considerations. The degree of the\r\ndemoralisation of different units and the condition of different\r\nsectors of a given firing line, purely accidental, had also to be taken\r\ninto account. And yet the statement that our technical backwardness\r\nwas one of the reasons of our collapse in 1917 should be accepted with\r\nreservations. Of course, our Army was backward, but in 1917 it was\r\ninfinitely better equipped, had more guns and ammunition and wider\r\nexperience of her own and of other fronts than in 1916. Our technical\r\nbackwardness was a relative factor which was present at all times in\r\nthe Great War before the Revolution, but was remedied in 1917, and\r\ncannot, therefore, be taken into account as a decisive feature in\r\nestimating the Russian Revolutionary Army and its work in the field.\r\n\r\nIt was the work of Sisyphus. The Commanding Officers gave their heart\r\nand soul to the work because in its success they saw the last ray\r\nof hope for the salvation of the Army and of the country. Technical\r\ndifficulties could be overcome, as long as the moral could be raised.\r\n\r\nBrussilov arrived and addressed the regiment. As a result, the officer\r\ncommanding the 10th Army was relieved against my will ten days before\r\nthe decisive advance. And it was not without difficulty that I secured\r\nthe appointment of General Lomnovsky, the gallant Commander of the\r\n8th Army Corps, who had arrived at the Front ten days before the\r\naction. There was an unpleasant misunderstanding about Brussilov's\r\nvisit. Headquarters had mistakenly informed the troops that Kerensky\r\nwas coming. This substitution provoked strong discontent among the\r\ntroops. Many units declared that they were being deceived, and that\r\nunless Comrade Kerensky himself orders them to advance they would\r\nnot advance. The 2nd Caucasian Division sent delegates to Petrograd\r\nto make inquiries. And efforts had to be made to appease them by\r\npromising that Comrade Kerensky was due to arrive in a few days. The\r\nWar Minister had to be invited. Kerensky came reluctantly, because he\r\nwas already disillusioned by the failure of his oratorical campaign\r\non the South-Western Front. For several days he reviewed the troops,\r\ndelivered speeches, was enthusiastically received and sometimes\r\nunexpectedly rebuked. He interrupted his tour, as he was invited to\r\nhurry to Petrograd on July 4th, but he returned with renewed energy and\r\nwith a new up-to-date theme, making full use of the \"knife with which\r\nthe Revolution had been stabbed in the back\" (the Petrograd rising of\r\nJuly 3rd-5th). Having, however, completed his tour and returned to the\r\nStavka, he emphatically declared to Brussilov:\r\n\r\n\"I have no faith whatsoever in the success of the advance.\"\r\n\r\nKerensky was equally pessimistic in those days with regard to\r\nanother matter, the future destinies of the country. He discussed in\r\nconversation with myself and two or three of his followers, the stages\r\nof the Russian Revolution, and expressed the conviction that whatever\r\nhappened we should not escape the Reign of Terror. The days went by and\r\nthe advance was further delayed. As early as on June 18th, I issued the\r\nfollowing Order of the Day to the Armies of my Front:\r\n\r\n\"The Russian Army of the South-Western Front have this day defeated\r\nthe enemy and broken through his lines. A decisive battle has begun\r\non which depends the fate of the Russian people and of its liberties.\r\nOur brethren on the South-Western Front are victoriously advancing,\r\nsacrificing their lives and expecting us to render them speedy\r\nassistance. We shall not be traitors. The enemy shall soon hear the\r\nroaring of our guns. I appeal to the troops of the Western Front to\r\nmake every effort and to prepare as soon as possible for an advance,\r\notherwise we shall be cursed by the Russian people who have entrusted\r\nto us the defence of their liberty, honour, and property.\"\r\n\r\nI do not know whether those who read this order, published in the\r\npapers in complete contravention of all the conditions of secrecy\r\nof operation, understood all the inner tragedy of the Russian Army.\r\nAll strategy was turned topsy-turvy. The Russian Commander-in-Chief,\r\npowerless to advance his troops and thus alleviate the position of\r\nthe neighbouring Front, wanted (even at the cost of exposing his\r\nintentions) to hold the German divisions which were being moved from\r\nhis Front and sent to the South-Western and the Allied Front.\r\n\r\nThe Germans responded immediately by sending the following proclamation\r\nto the Front:\r\n\r\n\"Russian soldiers! Your Commander-in-Chief of the Western Front is\r\nagain calling on you to fight. We know of his order, and also know\r\nof the false report that our line to the South-East of Lvov has been\r\nbroken. Do not believe it. In reality thousands of Russian corpses are\r\nlying before our trenches. An advance will never lead to peace. If,\r\nnevertheless, you obey the call of your commanders, who are bribed by\r\nEngland, then we shall continue the struggle until you are overthrown.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, on July 8th, the thunder of our guns was heard. On July 9th\r\nthe storming began, and three days after I was on my way from the 10th\r\nArmy to Minsk, with despair in my heart, and clearly recognising that\r\nthe last hope of a miracle was gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE RUSSIAN ADVANCE IN THE SUMMER OF 1917--THE DÉBÂCLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Russian offensive which had been planned for the month of May was\r\nbeing delayed. At first a simultaneous advance on all fronts had been\r\ncontemplated; later, however, owing to the psychological impossibility\r\nof a forward movement on all fronts, it was decided to advance\r\ngradually. The Western Front was of secondary importance, and the\r\nNorthern was intended only for demonstration. They should have moved\r\nfirst in order to divert the attention and the forces of the enemy from\r\nthe main front--the South-Western. The first two of the above-named\r\nfronts were not, however, ready for the advance. The Supreme Command\r\nfinally decided to abandon the strategical plan and to give the\r\ncommanders of various fronts a free hand in starting operations as\r\nthe Armies would be ready, provided these operations were not delayed\r\ntoo long and the enemy was not given the opportunity of carrying out\r\nre-groupings on a large scale.\r\n\r\nEven such a strategy, simplified as it had been owing to the\r\nRevolution, might have yielded great results, considering the\r\nworld-wide scope of the War; if the German Armies on the Eastern\r\nFront could not have been utterly defeated, that Front might at least\r\nhave been restored to its former importance. The Central Powers might\r\nhave been compelled to send to that Front large forces, war material\r\nand munitions, thus severely handicapping Hindenburg's strategy and\r\ncausing him constant anxiety. The operations were finally fixed for the\r\nfollowing dates: They were to begin on the South-Western Front on June\r\n16th, on the Western on July 7th, on the Northern on July 8th, and on\r\nthe Roumanian on July 6th. The last three dates almost coincide with\r\nthe beginning of the collapse (July 6th-7th) of the South-Western Front.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, in June, 1917, the Revolutionary Democracy had\r\nalready acquiesced in the idea that an advance was necessary, although\r\nthis acquiescence was qualified. The offensive thus had the moral\r\nsupport of the Provisional Government, the Commanding Staffs, all the\r\nofficers, the Liberal Democracy, the Defencist Coalition of the Soviet,\r\nthe Commissars, of nearly all Army Committees, and of many Regimental\r\nCommittees. Against the offensive the minority of the Revolutionary\r\nDemocracy was ranged--the Bolsheviks, the Social-Revolutionaries\r\nof Tchernov's and of Martov's (Zederbaum) group. There was a small\r\nappendix to this minority--the Democratisation of the Army.\r\n\r\nAt the moment of writing I do not possess a complete list of the\r\nRussian Armies, but I may confidently assert that on all sectors upon\r\nwhich the advance had been planned we had a numerical and a technical\r\nsuperiority over the enemy, more especially in guns, of which we had\r\nlarger quantities than ever. It fell to the lot of the South-Western\r\nFront to test the fighting capacity of the Revolutionary Army.\r\n\r\nThe group of armies under General Bohm-Ermolli (the 4th and 2nd\r\nAustrian Armies and the Southern German Armies) stood between the upper\r\nSereth and the Carpathians (Brody-Nadvorna) on the position north of\r\nthe Dniester which we had captured after Brussilov's victorious advance\r\nin the autumn of 1916. South of the Dniester stood the 3rd Austrian\r\nArmy of General Kirchbach, which formed the Left Wing of the Archduke\r\nJoseph's Carpathian Front. Our best Army Corps, which were intended as\r\nshock troops, were opposed to the last three Armies mentioned above.\r\nThese Austro-German troops had already been dealt many heavy blows by\r\nthe Russian Armies in the summer and in the autumn of 1916. Since then,\r\nthe Southern German Divisions of General Botmer, which had been hard\r\nhit, had been replaced by fresh troops from the North. Although the\r\nAustrian Armies had been to a certain extent reorganised by the German\r\nHigh Command and reinforced by German divisions, they did not represent\r\na formidable force and, according to the German Headquarters, were not\r\nfit for active operations.\r\n\r\nSince the Germans had occupied the Cherviche \"Place d'armes\" on the\r\nStokhod, Hindenburg's Headquarters had given orders that no operations\r\nshould be conducted, as it was hoped that the disruption of the Russian\r\nArmy and of the country would follow its natural course, assisted by\r\nGerman propaganda. The Germans estimated the fighting capacity of our\r\nArmy very low. Nevertheless, when Hindenburg realised in the beginning\r\nof June that a Russian advance was a contingency to be reckoned with,\r\nhe moved six divisions from the Western-European front and sent them to\r\nreinforce the group of Armies of Bohm-Ermolli. The enemy was perfectly\r\nwell aware of the directions in which we intended to advance....\r\n\r\nThe Russian Armies of the South-Western Front, commanded by General\r\nGutor, were to strike in the main direction of Kamenetz-Podolsk-Lvov.\r\nThe Armies were to move along both banks of the Dniester: General\r\nErdely's 11th Army in the direction of Zlochev, General Selivatchev's\r\n7th Army towards Brjeczany, and General Kornilov's 8th Army towards\r\nGalitch. In the event of victory we would reach Lvov, break through\r\nbetween the fronts of Bohm-Ermolli and the Archduke Joseph, and would\r\ndrive the latter's left wing to the Carpathians, cutting it off from\r\nall available natural means of communication. The remainder of our\r\nArmies on the South-Western Front were stretched along a broad front\r\nfrom the river Pripet to Brody for active defence and demonstration.\r\n\r\nOn June 16th the guns of the shock troops of the 7th and 11th Army\r\nopened a fire of such intensity as had never been heard before. After\r\ntwo days of continuous fire, which destroyed the enemy's strong\r\nposition, the Russian regiments attacked. The enemy line was broken\r\nbetween Zvorov and Brjeczany on a front of several miles; we took two\r\nor three fortified lines. On June 19th the attack was renewed on a\r\nfront of forty miles, between the Upper Strypa and the Narauvka. In\r\nthis heavy and glorious battle the Russian troops took three hundred\r\nofficers and eighteen thousand men prisoners in two days, twenty-nine\r\nguns, and other booty. The enemy positions were captured on many\r\nsectors, and we penetrated the enemy lines to an average depth of over\r\ntwo miles, driving him back to the Strypa in the direction of Zlochev.\r\n\r\nThe news of our victory spread all over Russia, evoked universal\r\nrejoicings, and raised the hopes for the revival of the former strength\r\nof the Russian Army. Kerensky reported to the Provisional Government as\r\nfollows: \"This day is the day of a great triumph for the Revolution.\r\nOn June 18th the Russian Revolutionary Army, in very high spirits,\r\nbegan the advance and has proved before Russia and before the world its\r\nardent devotion to the cause of the Revolution and its love of Country\r\nand Liberty.... The Russian warriors are inaugurating a new discipline\r\nbased upon feelings of a citizen's duty.... An end has been made to-day\r\nof all the vicious calumnies and slander about the organisation of\r\nthe Russian Army, which has been rebuilt on Democratic lines....\" The\r\nman who wrote these words had afterwards the courage to claim that it\r\nwas not he who had destroyed the Army, because he had taken over the\r\norganisation as a fatal inheritance!\r\n\r\nAfter three days' respite, a violent battle was resumed on the front\r\nof the 11th Army on both sides of the railway line on the front\r\nBatkuv-Koniuchi. By that time the threatened German regiments were\r\nreinforced, and stubborn fighting ensued. The 11th Army captured\r\nseveral lines, but suffered heavy losses. The trenches changed hands\r\nseveral times after a hand-to-hand battle, and great efforts had to\r\nbe made in order to break the resistance of the enemy, who had been\r\nreinforced and had recovered. This action practically signified the end\r\nof the advance of the 7th and 11th Armies. The impetus was spent and\r\nthe troops began once more to sit in the trenches, the monotony of this\r\npastime being only broken in places by local skirmishes, Austro-German\r\ncounter-attacks, and intermittent gunfire. Meanwhile preparations\r\nfor the advance began on June 23rd in Kornilov's Army. On June 25th\r\nhis troops broke through General Kirchbach's positions west of\r\nStanislavov and reached the line of Jesupol-Lyssetz. After a stubborn\r\nand sanguinary battle Kirchbach's troops, utterly defeated, ran and\r\ndragged along in their headlong flight the German division which had\r\nbeen sent to reinforce them. On the 27th General Cheremissov's right\r\ncolumn captured Galitch, some of his troops crossed the Dniester.\r\nOn the 28th the left column overcame the stubborn resistance of the\r\nAustro-Germans and captured Kalush. In the next two or three days, the\r\n8th Army was in action on the river Lomnitza and finally established\r\nitself on the banks of the river and in front of it. In the course of\r\nthis brilliant operation Kornilov's Army broke through the 3rd Austrian\r\nArmy on a front of over twenty miles and captured 150 officers, 10,000\r\nmen, and about 100 guns. The capture of Lomnitza opened to Kornilov the\r\nroad to Dolina-Stryi and to the communications of Botmer's Army. German\r\nHeadquarters described the position of the Commander-in-Chief of the\r\nWestern Front as _critical_.\r\n\r\nGeneral Bohm-Ermolli meanwhile was concentrating all his reserves in\r\nthe direction of Zlochev, the point to which the German divisions were\r\nlikewise sent which had been taken from the Western European Front.\r\nSome of the reserves had to be sent, however, across the Dniester\r\nagainst the 8th Russian Army. They arrived on July 2nd, reinforced the\r\nshattered ranks of the 3rd Austrian Army, and from that day positional\r\nbattles began on the Lomnitza, with varying success, and occasionally\r\nstubborn fighting. The concentration of the German shock troops between\r\nthe Upper Sereth and the railway line Tarnopol-Zlochev was completed\r\non July 5th. On the next day, after strong artillery preparations,\r\nthis group attacked our 11th Army, broke our front and moved swiftly\r\ntowards Kamenetz-Podolsk, pursuing the Army Corps of the 11th Army\r\nwho were fleeing in panic. The Army Headquarters, the Stavka and the\r\nPress, losing all perspective, blamed the 607th Mlynov Regiment as the\r\nchief cause of the catastrophe. The demoralised, worthless regiment had\r\nleft the trenches of their own accord and opened the front. It was, of\r\ncourse, a very sad occurrence, but it would be naïve to describe it\r\neven as an excuse. For as early as on the 9th of July the Committees\r\nand Commissars of the 11th Army were telegraphing to the Provisional\r\nGovernment: \"The truth and nothing but the truth about the events.\"\r\n\"The German offensive on the front of the 11th Army, which began on\r\nJuly 6th, is growing into an immeasurable calamity which threatens\r\nperhaps the very existence of Revolutionary Russia. The spirit of\r\nthe troops, that were prompted to advance by the heroic efforts of\r\nthe minority, has undergone a decisive and fatal change. The impetus\r\nof the advance was soon spent. Most of the units are in a condition\r\nof increasing disruption. There is not a shadow of discipline or\r\nobedience; persuasion is likewise powerless and is answered by threats\r\nand sometimes by shootings. Cases have occurred when orders to advance\r\nimmediately to reinforce the line were debated for hours at meetings,\r\nand reinforcements were twenty-four hours late. Some units arbitrarily\r\nleave the trenches without even waiting for the enemy to advance....\r\nFor hundreds of miles strings of deserters--healthy, strong men who\r\nthoroughly realise their impunity--are to be seen moving along with\r\nrifles or without.... The country should know the whole truth. It will\r\nshudder and will find the strength to fall with all its might upon\r\nall those whose cowardice is ruining and bartering Russia and the\r\nRevolution.\"\r\n\r\nThe Stavka wrote: \"In spite of its enormous numerical and technical\r\nsuperiority, the 11th Army was retreating uninterruptedly. On the\r\n8th of July it had already reached the Serenth, never halting at the\r\nvery strong fortified position to the West of the river, which had\r\nbeen our starting point in the glorious advance of 1916. Bohm-Ermolli\r\nhad detached some of his forces for the pursuit of the Russian\r\ntroops in the direction of Tarnapol and had moved his main forces\r\nsouthwards between the Serenth and the Strypa, threatening to cut off\r\nthe communication of the 7th Army, to throw them into the Dniester\r\nand, perhaps, cut off the retreat of the 8th Army. On July 9th the\r\nAustro-Germans had already reached Mikulinze, a distance of one march\r\nsouth of Tarnapol.... The Armies of General Selivatchev and Cheremissov\r\n(who had succeeded General Kornilov upon the latter's appointment on\r\nJuly 7th to the High Command of the South-Western Front) were in great\r\ndifficulty. They could not hope to resist the enemy by manoeuvring,\r\nand all that was left to them was to escape the enemy's blows by\r\nforced marches. The 7th Army was in particularly dire straits, as it\r\nwas retreating under the double pressure of the Army Corps of General\r\nBotmer, who was conducting a frontal attack, and of the troops of\r\nBohm-Ermolli, striking from the north against the denuded right flank.\r\nThe 8th Army had to march over one hundred miles under pressure from\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\nOn July 10th the Austro-Germans advanced to the line\r\nMikulinze-Podgaitze-Stanilavov. On the 11th the Germans occupied\r\nTarnapol, abandoned without fighting by the 1st Guards Army Corps. On\r\nthe next day they broke through our position on the rivers Gniezno\r\nand Sereth, South of Trembovlia, and developed their advance in the\r\nEastern and South-Eastern directions. On the same day, pursuing the\r\n7th and 8th Armies, the enemy occupied the line from the Sereth to\r\nMonsaterjisko-Tlumatch.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th July, seeing that the position was desperate, the\r\nCommander-in-Chief issued orders for a retreat from the Sereth, and by\r\nthe 21st the Armies of the South-Western Front, having cleared Galicia\r\nand Bukovina, reached the Russian frontier. Their retreat was marked\r\nby fires, violence, murders and plunder. A few units, however, fought\r\nthe enemy stubbornly and covered the retreat of the maddened mob of\r\ndeserters by sacrificing their lives. Among them were Russian officers,\r\nwhose bodies covered the battlefields. The Armies were retreating in\r\ndisorder; the same Armies that, only a year ago, had captured Lutsk,\r\nBrody-Stanislavov, Chernovetz in their triumphal progress ... were\r\nretreating before the same Austro-German troops that only a year ago\r\nhad been completely defeated and had strewn with fugitives the plains\r\nof Volynia, Galicia and Bukovina, leaving hundreds of thousands of\r\nprisoners in our hands. We shall never forget that in Brussilov's\r\nadvance of 1916, the 7th, 8th, 9th and 11th Armies took 420,000\r\nprisoners, 600 guns, 2,500,000 machine guns, etc. Our Allies are not\r\nlikely to forget this either; they know full well that the loud echo of\r\nthe Galician battle sounded on the Somme and at Goritza.\r\n\r\nThe Commissars Savinkov and Filonenko telegraphed to the Provisional\r\nGovernment: \"There is no choice; the traitors must be executed....\r\nCapital punishment must be meted out to all those who refuse to\r\nsacrifice their lives for their country....\"\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of July, after the Russian advance had ostensibly\r\nfailed, it was decided at Hindenburg's Headquarters to undertake a\r\nnew extensive operation against the Roumanian front by a simultaneous\r\nadvance of the 3rd and 7th Austrian Armies across Bukovina into\r\nMoldavia and of the Right group of General Mackensen on the Lower\r\nSereth. The objective was to seize Moldavia and Bessarabia. But on\r\nJuly 11th the Russian Army of General Ragosa and the Roumanian Army\r\nof General Averesco took the offensive between the rivers Susitsa\r\nand Putna against the 9th Austrian Army. The attack was successful,\r\nthe enemy positions were captured, the Armies moved forward several\r\nmiles, took 2,000 prisoners and over 60 guns, but the operation was not\r\ndeveloped. Owing to the natural conditions of the theatre of war and\r\nto the direction in which the operation was undertaken, it was more\r\nakin to a demonstration in order to relieve the South-Western Front.\r\nAlso the troops of the 4th Russian Army soon lost all impetus for the\r\nadvance. In July and until August 4th, the troops of the Archduke\r\nJoseph and of Mackensen attacked in several directions and gained\r\nlocal successes, but without any appreciable result. Although the\r\nRussian divisions repeatedly disobeyed orders and occasionally left the\r\ntrenches during the battle, yet the condition of the Roumanian Front\r\nwas somewhat better than that of the other Front, owing to its distance\r\nfrom Petrograd, to the presence of disciplined Roumanian troops and\r\nto the natural conditions of the country. For these reasons we were\r\nable to keep that Front somewhat longer. This circumstance, together\r\nwith the apparent weakness of the Austrian Armies, especially the 3rd\r\nand the 7th, and the complete dislocation of the communications of\r\nBohm-Ermolli's group and of the Archduke Joseph's left wing--caused\r\nHindenburg's Headquarters indefinitely to postpone the operation, and\r\na period of calm ensued along the entire South-Western Front. On the\r\nRoumanian Front local actions were fought until the end of August.\r\nAt the same time, German divisions began to move from the Sbrucz\r\nnorthwards in the direction of Riga. Hindenburg's plan was to deal\r\nthe Russian Army local blows, without straining his own resources or\r\nspending large reserves, so urgently needed, on the Western-European\r\nFront. By these tactics he intended to contribute to the natural course\r\nof the collapse of the Russian front, for it was upon this collapse\r\nthat the Central Powers based all their calculations in regard to\r\noperations and even in regard to the possibility of continuing the\r\ncampaign in 1918.\r\n\r\nOur efforts at advancing on other Fronts also ended in complete\r\nfailure. On the 7th of July operations began on the Western Front,\r\nwhich I commanded. The details will be given in the next chapter. Of\r\nthis operation Ludendorf wrote: \"Of all the attacks directed against\r\nthe former Eastern front of General Eichhorn, the attacks of July 9th,\r\nSouth of Smorgom, and at Krevo were particularly fierce.... For several\r\ndays the position was extremely difficult until our reserves and our\r\ngunfire restored the front. The Russians left our trenches; they were\r\nno longer the Russians of the old days.\"\r\n\r\nOn the Northern Front, in the 5th Army, everything was over in one\r\nday. The Stavka wrote: \"South-West of the Dvinsk our troops, after\r\nstrong artillery preparation, captured the German position across the\r\nrailway Dvinsk-Vilna. Subsequently, entire divisions, without pressure\r\nfrom the enemy, deliberately retreated to their own trenches.\" The\r\nStavka noted the heroic behaviour of several units, the prowess of\r\nthe officers and the tremendous losses which the latter had suffered.\r\nThis fact, however unimportant from the strategical point of view,\r\ndeserves to be specially noted. As a matter of fact, the 5th Army was\r\ncommanded by General Danilov (afterwards a member of the Bolshevik\r\nDelegation at Brest-Litovsk. He served in 1920 in the Russian Army in\r\nthe Crimea). He enjoyed exceptional prestige with the Revolutionary\r\nDemocracy. According to Stankevitch, the Commissar of the Northern\r\nFront, Danilov \"was the only General who had remained, in spite of the\r\nRevolution, full master in the Army and had succeeded in so dealing\r\nwith the new institutions--the Commissars and the Committees--that\r\nthey strengthened his authority instead of weakening it.... He knew\r\nhow to make use of these elements, and he overcame all obstacles in a\r\nspirit of complete self-control and firmness. In the 5th Army everyone\r\nwas working, learning and being educated.... As the best and the most\r\ncultured elements of the Army were working to that end.\" This is a\r\nstriking proof of the fact that even when the Commanding Officer\r\nbecomes thoroughly familiar with Revolutionary institutions, this does\r\nnot serve as a guarantee of the fighting capacity of his troops.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn July 11th Kornilov, upon his appointment to the Chief Command\r\nof the South-Western Front, sent to the Provisional Government his\r\nwell-known telegram, of which he forwarded a copy to the Supreme\r\nCommander-in-Chief. In that telegram, already quoted above, Kornilov\r\ndemanded the reintroduction of capital punishment, and wrote: \"...\r\nI declare that the country is on the verge of collapse and that,\r\nalthough I have not been consulted, I _demand_ that the offensive be\r\nstopped on all Fronts in order that the Army may be saved, preserved\r\nand re-organised on the basis of strict discipline, and in order that\r\nthe lives may not be sacrificed of a few heroes who are entitled to\r\nsee better days.\" In spite of the peculiar wording of this appeal, the\r\nidea of stopping the advance was immediately accepted by the Supreme\r\nCommand, the more so that the operations had practically come to a\r\nstandstill irrespective of orders as a result of the reluctance of the\r\nRussian Army to fight and to advance, as well as of the schemes of the\r\nGerman Headquarters.\r\n\r\nCapital punishment and Revolutionary courts-martial were introduced\r\nat the front. Kornilov gave an order to shoot deserters and robbers\r\nand to expose their bodies with corresponding notices on the roads\r\nand in other prominent places. Special shock battalions were formed\r\nof cadets and volunteers to fight against desertion, plunder and\r\nviolence. Kornilov forbade meetings at the Front and gave an order to\r\nstop them by the force of arms. These measures--which were introduced\r\nby Kornilov at his own risk and peril, his manly, straightforward\r\nutterances, and the firm tone in which, disregarding discipline, he\r\nbegan to address the Provisional Government, and last, but not least,\r\nhis resolute action--considerably enhanced his authority with the\r\nwide circles of Liberal Democracy and with the officers. Even the\r\nRevolutionary Democracy within the Army, stunned and depressed as it\r\nwas by the tragic turn of events, saw in Kornilov, for some time after\r\nthe _débâcle_, the last resource and the only possible remedy in the\r\ndesperate position. It may be stated that the date of July 8th, on\r\nwhich Kornilov took command of the South-Western Front and addressed\r\nhis first demand to the Provisional Government, sealed his fate: in\r\nthe eyes of many people he became a national hero and great hopes were\r\ncentred upon him--he was expected to save the country.\r\n\r\nDuring my stay at Minsk I was not very well informed of the unofficial\r\ntidings prevailing in military circles, yet I felt that the centre\r\nof moral influence had moved to Berditchev (Headquarters of the\r\nSouth-Western Front). Kerensky and Brussilov had somehow suddenly\r\nreceded to the background. A new method of administration was put\r\ninto practice: we received from Kornilov's Headquarters copies of\r\nhis \"demands\" or notices of some strong and striking decision he had\r\nadopted, and in a few days these were repeated from Petrograd or from\r\nthe Stavka, but in the shape of an order or of a regulation.\r\n\r\nThe tragedy of July undoubtedly had a sobering effect upon the men. In\r\nthe first place, they were ashamed because things had happened that\r\nwere so shameful and so disgraceful that even the dormant conscience\r\nand the deadened spirit of the men could not find excuses for these\r\nhappenings. Several months later, in November, after fleeing from\r\nthe captivity of Bykhov, I spent several days under an assumed name\r\nand in civilian clothes among the soldiers who had flooded all the\r\nrailways. They were discussing the past. I never heard a single man\r\nconfessing openly or cynically his participation in the treachery of\r\nJuly. They all tried to explain away the matter and chiefly attributed\r\nit to somebody's treason, especially, of course, the treason of the\r\nofficers. None spoke of his own treachery. In the second place, the men\r\nwere frightened. They felt that a kind of power, a kind of authority\r\nhad arisen, and they were quietly waiting for developments. Lastly,\r\noperations had ended and nervous tension had been relieved--which\r\ncaused a certain reaction, apathy and indifference. _This was the\r\nsecond occasion (the first took place in March) on which, had the\r\nmoment been immediately and properly taken advantage of--it might have\r\nbeen the turning point in the history of the Russian Revolution._\r\n\r\nAs the sounds were dying out of the last shots fired at the Front, the\r\nmen who had been stunned by the disaster began to recover their senses.\r\nKerensky was the first to return to sanity. The horror had passed away,\r\nthe nerve-wrecking, maddening fear which had prompted the issue of\r\nthe first stringent order. Kerensky's will-power was dominated by his\r\nfear of the Soviet, of the danger of definitely losing all prestige\r\nwith the Revolutionary Democracy by resentment against Kornilov for\r\nthe resolute tone of the latter's messages and by the shadow of the\r\npotential dictator. The drafts of military regulations by which it\r\nwas intended to restore the power of the Commanding Officers and of\r\nthe Army were drowned in red tape and in the turmoil of personal\r\nconflicts, suspicions and hatreds. The Revolutionary Democracy once\r\nagain sternly opposed the new course, as it interpreted this course\r\nas an infringement upon the liberties and as a menace to its own\r\nexistence. The same attitude was adopted by the Army Committees, whose\r\npowers were to be curtailed as a first step in the proposed changes. In\r\nthese circles the new course was described as counter-revolutionary.\r\nThe masses of the soldiery, on the other hand, soon appraised the\r\nnew situation. They saw that stern words were mere words, that\r\ncapital punishment was only a bogy, because there was no real force\r\ncapable of mastering their arbitrariness. So fear vanished again. The\r\nhurricane did not clear the close and tense atmosphere. New clouds were\r\noverhanging and peals of a new deafening thunder were to be heard in\r\nthe distance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: General Kornilov's arrival at Petrograd.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: General Kornilov in the trenches.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nTHE CONFERENCE AT THE STAVKA OF MINISTERS AND COMMANDERS-IN-CHIEF ON\r\nJULY 16TH.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon my return from the Front to Minsk I was summoned to the Stavka\r\nat Moghilev, where a Conference was to be held on July 16th. Kerensky\r\nsuggested that Brussilov should invite, of his own accord, the\r\nprominent military chiefs, in order to discuss the actual condition\r\nof the Front, the consequences on the July disaster, and to determine\r\nthe course of future military policy. It transpired that General\r\nGourko, who had been invited by Brussilov, had not been admitted to the\r\nConference by Kerensky. A telegram was sent to Kornilov from the Stavka\r\nsaying that, in view of the difficult position of the South-Western\r\nFront, his attendance was impossible, and that he was requested to\r\npresent in writing his views on the questions under discussion. It\r\nshould be noted that, at that time, on July 14th and 15th, the 11th\r\nArmy was in full retreat from the Sereth to the Zbrucz, and that\r\neveryone was anxious to hear whether the 7th Army had succeeded in\r\ncrossing the Lower Sereth and the 8th the line of Zalestchiki, thus\r\navoiding the blows of the German Armies that were trying to cut their\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\nSo sad was the plight of the country and the Army that I decided\r\nto disclose to the Conference the full truth on the condition of\r\nthe Army in all its hideous nakedness, and in disregard of all\r\nconventionalities. I reported myself to the Supreme Commander-in-Chief.\r\nBrussilov surprised me. He said: \"I have come to the conclusion\r\nthat this is the limit and we must put the question squarely. All\r\nthese Commissars, Committees and Democratisations are driving the\r\nArmy and Russia to ruin. I have decided categorically to demand that\r\nthey should cease to disorganise the Army. I hope that you will back\r\nme?\" I answered that this was in full accord with my intentions and\r\nthat the object of my visit was to put the question squarely of the\r\nfuture destinies of the Army. I must confess that Brussilov's words\r\nreconciled me with him and I therefore decided to eliminate from my\r\nspeech all the bitter things which I had intended to say against the\r\nSupreme Command.\r\n\r\nWe waited about an hour and a half for the Conference to meet. We\r\nafterwards learnt that a small incident had occurred. The Prime\r\nMinister had not been met at the station either by Brussilov or by his\r\nChief-of-Staff (General Lukomsky), who had been detained by urgent\r\nmilitary business. Kerensky waited for some time and grew nervous. He\r\nfinally sent his _aide-de-camp_ to Brussilov with the order to come to\r\nthe station at once and to report. The incident was not commented upon,\r\nbut all those who have been in touch with politics know that the actors\r\non that stage are mere men, with all their weaknesses, and that the\r\ngame is often continued behind the curtain.\r\n\r\nThe Conference was attended by the Prime Minister Kerensky, the\r\nForeign Minister Terestchenko, the Supreme C.-in-C. Brussilov, his\r\nChief-of-Staff General Lukomsky, Generals Alexeiev and Ruzsky, the\r\nC.-in-C. of the Northern Front General Klembovsky, by myself as\r\nC.-in-C. of the Western Front, and by my Chief-of-Staff General Markov,\r\nAdmiral Maximov, Generals Velitchko and Romanovsky, the Commissar of\r\nthe Western Front Savinkov, and two or three young men of Kerensky's\r\nsuite.\r\n\r\nGeneral Brussilov addressed the Conference in a short speech, which\r\nstruck me as being very vague and commonplace. In fact, he said nothing\r\nat all. I had hoped that Brussilov would keep his word and would sum up\r\nthe situation and draw conclusions. I was mistaken. Brussilov did not\r\nspeak again. I opened the discussion. I said:\r\n\r\n\"It is with deep emotion and in full consciousness of a grave\r\nresponsibility that I am delivering my report to the Conference. I\r\nbeg to be excused if I speak as openly and frankly as I have always\r\ndone. I was outspoken with the old Autocracy, and intend to be just as\r\noutspoken with the new--the Revolutionary Autocracy.\r\n\r\n\"When I took Command of the Front, I found the Armies in a state of\r\ncomplete disruption. This seemed the more strange that neither in the\r\nreports received at the Stavka or in those I received upon taking\r\nover the Command had the situation been described in such gloomy\r\ncolours. The explanation is obvious: as long as the Army Corps were not\r\nconducting active operations, excesses were comparatively few; but no\r\nsooner was the order given for doing the duty of a soldier, for taking\r\nup positions or for the advance, than the instinct of self-preservation\r\nasserted itself and the picture of disruption was unveiled. Some ten\r\ndivisions refused to take up positions. All Commanding Officers of\r\nall grades had to work very hard, to argue, to persuade.... In order\r\nto be able to carry out the slightest measure of any importance, it\r\nbecame imperative to reduce the numbers of mutinous troops. A whole\r\nmonth was thus lost, although some divisions obeyed orders. Disruption\r\nwas rampant in the 2nd Caucasian Corps and in the 169th Infantry\r\nDivision. Several units had lost human appearance, not only morally but\r\nphysically. I shall never forget the hour which I spent in the 703rd\r\nSuram Regiment. There were up to ten private stills in each regiment;\r\ndrunkenness, cardplaying, rioting, plunder and even murder. I took a\r\ndrastic step. I sent the 2nd Caucasian Corps (except the 51st Infantry\r\nDivision and the 169th Infantry Division) to the rear and ordered them\r\nto be disbanded. Before the operation had developed, I thus lost about\r\n30,000 bayonets without firing a shot. The 28th and 29th Infantry\r\nDivisions, which were considered the best, were sent to occupy the\r\nsector of the Caucasians. What happened? The 29th Division, after a\r\nforced march to its destination, returned on the next day almost in\r\nits entirety (two and a half regiments). The 28th Division sent one\r\nregiment to the trenches, and that regiment passed a resolution against\r\nadvancing. Every possible measure was taken in order to raise the\r\nspirit of the troops. The Supreme Commander-in-Chief visited the Front.\r\nFrom his conversations with the members of Committee and with the\r\nmen elected from two Army Corps he gathered the impression that 'the\r\nsoldiers were all right, but the Commanding Officers had lost heart.'\r\nThat is not so. The Commanding Officers did all they could in extremely\r\ndifficult and painful surroundings, but the Supreme Commander-in-Chief\r\nis unaware of the fact that the meeting of the 1st Siberian Corps,\r\nwhere his speech was most enthusiastically received, continued after\r\nhis departure. New speakers came forward and appealed to the men not\r\nto listen to the 'old Bourgeois' (forgive me, that is so.... Brussilov\r\ninterjected: \"I do not mind\") and they heaped vile abuse upon his head.\r\nThese appeals were also enthusiastically greeted. The War Minister, who\r\nvisited the troops and by his fiery eloquence incited them to deeds\r\nof valour, was enthusiastically received by the 28th Division. Upon\r\nhis return to the train he was met by a regimental deputation which\r\nannounced that half an hour after the Minister had gone the regiment,\r\nas well as another one, had decided not to advance. The picture was\r\nparticularly moving and evoked great enthusiasm when, in the 29th\r\nDivision, the Commanding Officer of the Poti Infantry Regiment knelt to\r\nreceive the Red Banner. The men swore--there were three speakers and\r\npassionate cheering--to die for the country. On the first day of the\r\nadvance the regiment did not reach our trenches, but turned round in a\r\ndisgraceful manner and retreated six miles behind the battlefield.\r\n\r\n\"The Commissars and the Committee were among the factors which were\r\nmeant to give moral support to the troops, but practically contributed\r\nto their demoralisation. Among the Commissars there may have been\r\nfavourable exceptions of men who did a certain amount of good without\r\ninterfering with other people's business. But the institution itself\r\ncannot fail to contribute to the disruption of the Army because it\r\nimplies a dual power, friction and interference uncalled for and\r\ncriminal. I am compelled to describe the Commissars of the Western\r\nFront. One of them, for all I know, may be a good and honest man, but\r\nhe is an Utopian and not only ignorant of Army life, but of life in\r\ngeneral. He has a great idea of his own importance. In demanding that\r\nthe Chief-of-Staff should obey his orders, he declares that he is\r\nentitled to dismiss Commanding Officers, including the General Officer\r\ncommanding the Army. In explaining to the troops the extent of his\r\nauthority, he thus describes it: 'As the fronts are subordinate to the\r\nWar Minister, I am the War Minister for the Western Front.' Another\r\nCommissar, who knows about as much of Army life as the first one, is\r\na Social Democrat standing somewhere on the verge between Bolshevism\r\nand Menchevism. He is the noted reporter of the Military Section of\r\nthe All-Russian Congress of Soviets who has expressed the view that\r\nthe Army has not been sufficiently disorganised by the 'Declaration'\r\nand demanded further 'Democratisation.' He claimed the right for the\r\nmen to veto appointments of Commanding Officers, insisted upon part\r\n2 of Paragraph 14 of the Declaration which empowered the Commanding\r\nOfficers to use arms against cowards and traitors being cancelled, and\r\nupon freedom of speech being granted not only off parade, but on duty.\r\nThe 3rd Commissar, who was not a Russian, and who appeared to treat\r\nthe Russian soldier with contempt, in addressing the regiment used\r\nsuch foul language as had never fallen from the Commanding Officers\r\nunder the Czar's régime. Curiously enough the conscious and free\r\nRevolutionary warriors accept such treatment as their due and obey him.\r\nThat Commissar, according to the Commanding Officers, is undoubtedly\r\nuseful.\r\n\r\n\"The Committees are another disintegrating force. I do not deny that\r\nsome of the Committees have done excellent work, and have done their\r\nbest to fulfil their duty. In particular some of their members have\r\nbeen exceedingly useful, and have rendered their country the supreme\r\nservice of dying the death of heroes. But I affirm that the good they\r\nhave done will not compensate for the tremendous mischief done to the\r\nArmy by the introduction of all these new authorities, by friction, by\r\ninterference, and by discrediting the commands. I might quote hundreds\r\nof resolutions bearing that stamp, but will confine myself merely to\r\nthe most blatant cases. The struggle for seizing power in the Army is\r\ncarried on openly and systematically. The Chairman of the Committee\r\nof the Front has published in his paper an article advocating that\r\ngovernmental powers be granted to the Committee. The Army Committee of\r\nthe 3rd Army has passed the resolution, which to my intense surprise\r\nwas endorsed by the Commanding Officer, requesting 'that the Army\r\nCommittees be invested with the plenary powers of the War Minister and\r\nof the Central Committee of the Soviets which would entitle them to\r\nact in the name of that Committee.' When the famous 'Declaration' was\r\ndiscussed opinions varied in the Committee of the Front in regard to\r\nParagraph 14. Some members wanted the second part to be eliminated;\r\nothers demanded that a proviso be added empowering the members of the\r\nCommittee of the Front to take the same measures including armed force\r\nagainst the same persons, and even against the Commanding Officers\r\nthemselves. Is that not the limit? In the report of the All-Russian\r\nCongress a demand is formulated for the Soldiers' Committees to be\r\nallowed to cancel appointments of Commanding Officers, and to partake\r\nin the administration of the Army. You must not think that this is\r\nmerely theory. Far from it. The Committees endeavour to get hold of\r\neverything, to interfere with purely military questions, with the\r\nroutine and the administration. And this is being done in an atmosphere\r\nof complete anarchy caused by wholesale insubordination.\r\n\r\n\"Moral preparations for the advance were proceeding apace. On June 8th\r\nthe Committee of the Front passed a resolution against the advance, but\r\nchanged its mind on the 18th. The Committee of the 2nd Army decided\r\nagainst the offensive on June 1st, but cancelled its decision on June\r\n20th. In the Minsk Soviet 123 votes against 79 decided against the\r\nadvance. All the Committees of the 169th Infantry Division passed\r\na vote of censure on the Provisional Government, and described the\r\noffensive as \"treason to the Revolution.\" The campaign against the\r\nauthorities manifested itself in a series of dismissals of Senior\r\nCommanders, in which the Committees almost invariably participated.\r\nShortly before the opening of the operations an Army Corps Commander,\r\nthe Chief-of-Staff, and a Divisional Commander of the most important\r\nsector occupied by the shock troops, had to resign, and the same\r\nfate was shared by about 60 Commanding Officers, from Army Corps\r\nCommander to Regimental Commander. It is impossible to estimate the\r\namount of harm done by the Committee. They have no proper discipline\r\nof their own. If the majority passes a reasonable resolution, that\r\ndoes not suffice. It is put into practice by individual members of\r\nthe Committee. Taking advantage of their position as members of Army\r\nCommittees, the Bolsheviks have more than once spread mutiny and\r\nrebellion with impunity. As a result, authority is undermined instead\r\nof being strengthened, because so many different individuals and\r\ninstitutions are supposed to exercise that authority. And the Commander\r\nin the Field, who is being discredited, dismissed, controlled and\r\nwatched from all sides, is nevertheless expected to lead the troops\r\ninto action with a strong hand. Such was the moral preparation. The\r\ntroops have not yet been deployed. But the South-Western Front required\r\nimmediate assistance. The enemy had already removed from my Front to\r\nthe South-West three or four divisions. I decided to attack with the\r\ntroops which presented at least a semblance of loyalty. In three days\r\nour guns had smashed the enemy trenches and wrought havoc among them,\r\nhad inflicted heavy losses among the Germans, and had opened the way\r\nfor our infantry. The first line had been almost entirely broken, and\r\nour men had already visited the enemy batteries. That breach of the\r\nFront promised to develop into a great victory, for which we had been\r\nhoping for so long.... I now revert to descriptions of the battle.\r\n'The units of the 28th Infantry Division took up their positions only\r\nfour hours before the attack; of the 109th Regiment only two and a\r\nhalf companies, with four machine-guns and 30 officers, reached the\r\nappointed line; only one-half of the 110th came up. Two battalions of\r\nthe 111th Regiment, who had occupied the defiles, refused to advance;\r\nmen of the 112th Regiment retired to the rear in batches. Units of\r\nthe 28th Division were met by a strong artillery fire, machine-gun\r\nand rifle fire, and remained behind their barbed wire, as they were\r\nincapable of advancing. Only a few shock troops and volunteers of the\r\nVolga Regiment, with a company of officers, succeeded in capturing the\r\nfirst line, but the fire was so strong that they failed to keep the\r\nposition, and towards the afternoon units of the 29th Division returned\r\nto their original lines after suffering heavy losses, especially\r\nin officers. On the sector of the 51st Division the attack began\r\nat five minutes past seven. The 202nd Gori Regiment and the 204th\r\nArdagan-Michailovsky Regiment, as well as two companies of the Sukhum\r\nRegiment, with a shock company of the Poti Regiment, made a dash across\r\ntwo lines of trenches, bayoneted the enemy, and began to storm the\r\nthird line at half-past seven. The break was so rapid and so unexpected\r\nthat the enemy failed to establish a barrage. The 201st Poti Regiment,\r\nwhich was following the advance troops, approached our first line of\r\ntrenches, but refused to go any further, so that our troops who had\r\nbroken through were not reinforced in time. The units of the 134th\r\nDivision, which followed, could not carry out their orders because the\r\nmen of the Poti Regiment had crowded in the trenches, while the enemy\r\nhad opened a very strong gun fire. These units, therefore, partly\r\ndispersed and partly lay in our trenches. Seeing that no reinforcements\r\nwere forthcoming from the rear and from the flanks, the men of the Gori\r\nand Ardagan Regiments lost heart, and some of the companies, in which\r\nall the officers had been killed, began to retire. They were followed\r\nby the remainder of the troops without, however, any pressure from the\r\nGermans, who did not put their batteries and machine-guns into action\r\nuntil the retreat had begun.... The units of the 29th Division were\r\nlate in going into position, because the men advanced reluctantly,\r\nas their mood had changed. A quarter of an hour before the appointed\r\ntime the 114th Regiment on the right flank refused to advance, and\r\nthe Erivan Regiment had to be drawn up from the Army Corps Reserves.\r\nFor some unknown reason the 113th and 116th Regiments also failed\r\nto move.... After this failure desertion began to grow, and at dawn\r\nbecame general. The men were tired, nervous; they had lost the habit of\r\nfighting, and were unaccustomed to the roar of the guns owing to long\r\nmonths of inactivity, of fraternisation, and of meetings. They left the\r\ntrenches _en masse_, they abandoned the machine-guns and retired to the\r\nrear.... _The Headquarters of the 20th Army Corps sent the following\r\nreport of the battle: 'The cowardice and lack of discipline in certain\r\nunits reached such a pitch that the Commanding Officers were compelled\r\nto ask our artillery to cease firing, because the fire of our own guns\r\ncaused a panic among our soldiers.'_\r\n\r\n\"I will quote another description of the battle made by an Army Corps\r\nCommander who took command on the eve of battle, and whose impressions\r\nare therefore totally unbiassed: '... Everything was ready for the\r\nadvance: the plan had been worked out in detail; we had a powerful and\r\nefficient artillery; the weather was favourable because it did not\r\nallow the Germans to take advantage of their superiority in aircraft;\r\nwe had superior numbers, our Reserves were drawn up in time, we had\r\nplenty of ammunition, and the sector was well chosen for the advance,\r\nbecause we were in a position to conceal strong artillery forces in\r\nthe close neighbourhood of our trenches. The undulations of ground\r\nalso afforded many hidden approaches to the Front; the distance\r\nbetween ourselves and the enemy was small, and there were no natural\r\nobstacles between us which would have had to have been forced under\r\nfire. Finally, the troops had been prepared by the Committees, the\r\nCommanding Officers and the War Minister, Kerensky, and their efforts\r\ninduced the troops to take the first, the most arduous steps. We\r\nattained considerable success without suffering appreciable losses.\r\nThree fortified lines had been broken through and occupied, and there\r\nremained only separate defensive positions. The fighting might soon\r\nhave reached the phase of bayonet fighting; the enemy artillery was\r\nsilenced, over 1,400 Germans, many machine-guns and other booty had\r\nbeen captured. Also, our guns had inflicted heavy casualties in killed\r\nand wounded upon the enemy, and it may be confidently stated that\r\nthe forces that were opposing our Corps had been temporarily knocked\r\nout. Along the entire front of our Corps only three or four enemy\r\nbatteries and occasionally three or four machine-guns were firing, and\r\nthere were isolated rifle shots. But--night came. Immediately I began\r\nto receive anxious reports from officers commanding sectors at the\r\nFront to the effect that the men were abandoning the unattacked Front\r\nLine _en masse_, entire companies deserting. It was stated in some of\r\nthe reports that the firing line in places was only occupied by the\r\nCommanding Officer, his staff, and a few men. The operations ended in\r\nan irretrievable and hopeless failure. In one day we had lived through\r\nthe joy of victory, which had been won in spite of the low spirits\r\nof the men, as well as the horror of seeing the fruits of victory\r\ndeliberately cast away by the soldiery. And yet the country needed that\r\nvictory for its very life. I realised that we, the Commanding Officers,\r\nare powerless to alter the elemental psychology of the men, and I wept\r\nlong and bitterly.'\r\n\r\n\"This inglorious operation, however, resulted in serious losses, which\r\nit is now difficult to estimate, as crowds of fugitives returned daily.\r\nOver 20,000 wounded men have already passed through sorting stations\r\nin the rear. I will refrain at present from drawing any conclusion,\r\nbut the percentage of various kinds of wounds is symptomatic: 10 per\r\ncent. heavily wounded, 30 per cent. finger and wrist wounds, 40 per\r\ncent. light wounds from which bandages were not removed at the dressing\r\nstations (many wounds were probably simulated), and 20 per cent.\r\nbruised and sick. Such was the end of the operation. I have never yet\r\ngone into battle with such superiority in numbers and technical means.\r\nNever had the conditions been more full of such brilliant promise.\r\nOn a front of about 14 miles I had 184 battalions against 29 enemy\r\nbattalions; 900 guns against 300 German: 138 of my battalions came\r\ninto action against 17 German battalions of the 1st line. All that was\r\nwasted. Reports from various Commanders indicate that the temper of\r\nthe troops immediately after the operation was just as indefinite as\r\nbefore. Three days ago I summoned the Army Commanders and addressed to\r\nthem the question: 'Could their Armies resist a strong enemy attack,\r\nprovided reserves were forthcoming?' The answer was in the negative.\r\n'Could the Armies resist an organised German offensive in their present\r\ncondition, numerical and technical?' Two of the Army Commanders gave\r\nindefinite replies, and the Commanding Officer of the 10th Army\r\nanswered in the affirmative. They all said: 'We have no infantry.' I\r\nwill go further, and I will say:\r\n\r\n\"_We have no Army. It is necessary immediately, and at all costs to\r\ncreate that Army._ The new Government regulations, which are supposed\r\nto raise the spirit of the Army, have not yet penetrated into its\r\ndepths, and the impression they have produced cannot yet be defined.\r\nOne thing is certain--that repression alone cannot drag the Army out of\r\nthe morass into which it has fallen. It is repeated every day that the\r\nBolsheviks have caused the disruption of the Army, but I disagree. It\r\nis not so. The Army has been disrupted by others, and the Bolsheviks\r\nare like worms which have bred in the wounds of the Army. The Army has\r\nbeen disrupted by the regulations of the last four months, and it is\r\nthe bitter irony of fate that this has been done by men who, however\r\nhonest and idealistic, are unaware of the historical laws governing\r\nthe existence of the Army, of its life and routine. At first this was\r\ndone under pressure from the Soviet, which was primarily an Anarchist\r\ninstitution. Later it developed into a fatal, mistaken policy. Soon\r\nafter the War Minister had taken up his duties he said to me: 'The\r\nprocess of revolutionising the country and the Army has been completed.\r\nNow we must proceed with creative work....' I ventured to reply: 'The\r\nprocess is completed, but it is too late.'\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Brussilov here interrupted me, and asked me to curtail my\r\nReport, as the Conference would otherwise be too protracted. I realised\r\nthat the length of the Report was not what mattered, but it was its\r\nrisky substance, and I replied: \"I consider that this question is of\r\nparamount importance, and request that I be allowed to complete my\r\nstatement, otherwise I shall have to cease speaking.\" A silence ensued,\r\nwhich I interpreted as a permission to continue.\r\n\r\nI then proceeded: \"The Declaration of the Soldiers' Rights has been\r\nissued. Every one of the Commanding Officers has stated that it would\r\nbring about the ruin of the Army. The late Supreme C.-in-C., General\r\nAlexeiev, telegraphed that the Declaration was the last nail which was\r\nbeing driven into the coffin prepared for the Russian Army. The present\r\nSupreme C.-in-C., when in command of the South-Western Front, declared\r\nhere, at Moghilev, at the Conference of Commanders-in-Chief, that\r\nthe Army may yet be saved and may advance, but on one condition--if\r\nthe Declaration is not issued. Our advice, however, was unheeded.\r\nParagraph 3 of the Declaration authorises free and open expressions\r\nof political, religious, social, and other views. The Army was thus\r\nflooded by politics. When the men of the 2nd Caucasian Grenadier\r\nDivision were disbanded they were quite sincerely puzzled. 'What is\r\nthe reason? We were allowed to speak whenever and whatever we wished,\r\nand now we are being disbanded....' You must not think that such a\r\nbroad interpretation of the 'Liberties' is confined to the illiterate\r\nmasses. When the 169th Infantry Division was morally disrupted, and\r\nall the Committees of that Division passed a vote of censure upon\r\nthe Provisional Government and categorically refused to advance, I\r\ndisbanded the Division. But there arose an unexpected complication: the\r\nCommissars came to the conclusion that no crime had been committed,\r\nbecause the spoken and the written word were unrestricted. The only\r\nthing that could be incriminated was direct disobedience of Army\r\norders.... Paragraph 6 stipulates that all literature should be\r\ndelivered to the addressees, and the Army was flooded with criminal\r\nBolshevik and Defeatist literature. The stuff upon which our Army was\r\nfed--and apparently at the expense of Government funds and of the\r\npeople's treasure--can be gauged from the report of the Moscow Military\r\nBureau, which alone supplied to the Front the following publications:\r\n\r\nFrom March 24th to May 1st--\r\n\r\n  7,972 copies of the _Pravda_\r\n  2,000    \"     \"    _Soldiers' Pravda_\r\n 30,375    \"     \"    _Social Democrat_\r\n\r\nFrom May 1st to June 11th--\r\n\r\n 61,522 copies of the _Soldiers' Pravda_\r\n 32,711    \"     \"    _Social Democrat_\r\n  6,999    \"     \"    _Pravda_\r\n\r\nand so on. The same kind of literature was sent to the villages by the\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\n\"Paragraph 14 stipulates that no soldier can be punished without\r\na trial. Of course, this liberty applied only to the men, because\r\nthe officers continued to suffer the heaviest penalty of dismissal.\r\nWhat was the result? The Central Military Justice Administration,\r\nwithout reference to the Stavka and in view of the impending\r\nDemocratisation of the Courts, suggested that the latter should\r\nsuspend their activities, except for cases of special importance,\r\nsuch, for example, as treason. The Commanding Officers were deprived\r\nof disciplinary powers. Disciplinary Courts were partly inactive,\r\npartly were boycotted. Justice completely disappeared from the Army.\r\nThis boycott of Disciplinary Court and reports on the reluctance of\r\ncertain units to elect juries are symptomatic. The legislator may come\r\nacross the same phenomenon in respect of the new Revolutionary Military\r\nCourts, in which juries may also have to be replaced by appointed\r\njudges. As a result of a series of legislative measures, authority\r\nand discipline have been eliminated, the officers are dishonoured,\r\ndistrusted, and openly scorned. Generals in High Command, not excluding\r\nCommanders-in-Chief, are being dismissed like domestic servants. In one\r\nof his speeches at the Northern Front the War Minister inadvertently\r\nuttered the following significant words: 'It lies within my power\r\nto dismiss the entire personnel of the High Command in twenty-four\r\nhours, and the Army would not object.' In the speeches addressed to\r\nthe Western Front it was said that 'in the Czarist Army we were driven\r\ninto battle with whips and machine-guns ... that Czarist Commanders\r\nled us to slaughter, but now every drop of our blood is precious....'\r\nI, the Commander-in-Chief, stood by the platform erected for the War\r\nMinister, and I was heart-broken. My conscience whispered to me:\r\n'That is a lie. My \"Iron\" Rifles, only eight battalions and then\r\ntwelve, took over 60,000 prisoners and 43 guns.... I have never driven\r\nthem into battle with machine-guns. I have never led my troops to\r\nslaughter at Mezolaborch, Lutovisko, Lutsk, Chartoriisk.' To the late\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the South-Western Front these names are indeed\r\nfamiliar....\r\n\r\n\"Everything may be forgiven and we can stand a great deal if it is\r\nnecessary for victory, if the troops can regain their spirit and can\r\nbe induced to advance.... I will venture to draw a comparison. Sokolov\r\nand other Petrograd delegates came to our front, to the 703rd Suram\r\nRegiment. He came with the noble object of combating dark ignorance and\r\nmoral decrepitude, which were particularly apparent in that regiment.\r\nHe was mercilessly flogged. We were, of course, revolted against that\r\ncrowd of savage scoundrels, and everyone was perturbed. All kinds of\r\ncommittees passed votes of censure. The War Minister condemned the\r\nbehaviour of the Suram Regiment in fiery speeches and Army orders, and\r\nsent a telegram of sympathy to Sokolov.\r\n\r\n\"And here is another story. I well remember January, 1915, near\r\nLutovisko. There was a heavy frost. Colonel Noskov, the gallant\r\none-armed hero, up to the waist in snow, was leading his regiment to\r\nthe attack under a heavy fire against the steep and impregnable slopes\r\nof Height 804.... Death spared him then. And now two companies came,\r\nasked for General Noskov, surrounded him, killed him and went away.\r\nI ask the War Minister, did he condemn these foul murderers with the\r\nwhole might of his fiery eloquence, of his wrath and of his power, and\r\ndid he send a telegram of sympathy to the hapless family of the fallen\r\nhero?\r\n\r\n\"When we were deprived of power and authority, when the term\r\n'Commanding Officer' was sterilised, we have once again been insulted\r\nby a telegram from the Stavka to the effect that: 'Commanding Officers\r\nwho will now hesitate to apply armed force will be dismissed and\r\ntried.' No, gentlemen, you will not intimidate those who are ready to\r\nlose their lives in the service of their country.\r\n\r\n\"The senior Commanding Officers may now be divided into three\r\ncategories: some of them disregarding the hardships of life and service\r\nwith a broken heart, are doing their duty devotedly to the end; others\r\nhave lost heart and are following the tide; the third are curiously\r\nbrandishing the Red Flag, and mindful of the traditions of the Tartar\r\ncaptivity, are crawling before new gods of the Revolution as they\r\ncrawled before the Czars. It causes me infinite pain to mention the\r\nquestion of the Officers.... It is a nightmare, and I will be brief.\r\nWhen Sokolov became familiar with the Army, he said: 'I could not\r\nimagine that your officers could be such martyrs. I take off my hat to\r\nthem.' Yes, in the darkest days of Czarist autocracy, the police and\r\nthe gendarmerie never subjected the would-be criminal to such moral\r\ntorture and derision as the officers have to endure at present from\r\nthe illiterate masses, led by the scum of the Revolution. Officers\r\nwho are giving their lives for the country. They are insulted at\r\nevery turn. They are beaten. Yes, beaten. But they will not come and\r\ncomplain to you. They are ashamed, dreadfully ashamed. Alone, in their\r\ndug-outs, many of them are silently weeping over their dismal fate. No\r\nwonder many officers consider that the best solution is to be killed\r\nin action. Listen to the subdued and placid tragedy of the following\r\nwords which occur in a Field Report: 'In vain did the officers marching\r\nin front try to lead the men into action. At that a moment a white\r\nflag was raised on Redoubt No. 3. Fifteen officers and a small batch\r\nof soldiers then went forward. Their fate is unknown--they did not\r\nreturn.' (38th Corps). May these heroes rest in peace and their blood\r\nbe upon the heads of their conscious and unconscious executioners.\r\n\r\n\"The Army is falling to pieces. Heroic measures are needed for its\r\nsalvation: (1) The Provisional Government should recognise its mistakes\r\nand its guilt, as it has not understood and estimated the noble and\r\nsincere impulse of the officers who had greeted the news of the\r\nRevolution with joy, and had sacrificed innumerable lives for their\r\ncountry. (2) Petrograd, entirely detached from the Army, and ignorant\r\nof its life and of the historical foundations of its existence, should\r\ncease to enact military regulations. Full power must be given to the\r\nSupreme Commander-in-Chief, who should be responsible only to the\r\nProvisional Government. (3) Politics must disappear from the Army. (4)\r\nThe 'Declaration' must be rescinded in its fundamentals. Commissars\r\nand Committees must be abolished, and the functions of the latter must\r\ngradually be altered. (5) Commanding Officers must be restored to\r\npower. Discipline and the outward form of order and good conduct must\r\nlikewise be restored. (6) Appointments to prominent posts must be made\r\nnot only according to the standard of youth and strength, but also of\r\nexperience in the field and in administration. (7) Special law-abiding\r\nunits of all arms must be placed at the disposal of Commanding Officers\r\nas a bulwark against mutiny, and against the horrors of possible\r\ndemobilisation. (8) Military Revolutionary Courts must be established\r\nand capital punishment introduced in the rear for the troops and for\r\ncivilians guilty of the same crimes.\r\n\r\n\"If you ask me whether these measures are likely to produce good\r\nresults, I will answer frankly: Yes, but not at once. It is easy to\r\ndestroy the Army, but time is needed for its reconstruction. The\r\nmeasures I suggest would at least lay the foundations for the creation\r\nof a strong Army. In spite of the disruption of the Army, we must\r\ncontinue the struggle, however arduous it may be, and we must even be\r\nprepared to retreat into the depths of the country. Our Allies should\r\nnot count upon immediate relief through our advance. Even in retreating\r\nand remaining on the defensive, we are drawing upon us enormous enemy\r\nforces, which, were they relieved, would be sent to the Western Front\r\nand would crush the Allies and then turn against us. Upon this new\r\nCalvary the Russian people and the Russian Army may yet shed rivers\r\nof blood and endure privations and misfortunes. But at the end of the\r\nCalvary a bright future is in store.\r\n\r\n\"There is another way. The way of treason. It would give a respite\r\nto our martyred country.... But the curse of treachery cannot give\r\nus happiness. At the end of that path there is political, moral and\r\neconomic slavery. The destinies of the country are in the hands of the\r\nArmy. I now appeal to the Provisional Government represented here by\r\ntwo Ministers:\r\n\r\n\"You must lead Russia towards truth and enlightenment under the banner\r\nof Liberty, but you must give us a real chance of leading the troops in\r\nthe name of that same Liberty under our old banners. You need have no\r\nfear. The name of the autocrat has been removed from these banners as\r\nwell as from our hearts. It is no longer there. But there is a Mother\r\nCountry; there is a sea of blood; and there is the glory of our former\r\nvictories. You have trampled that banner into the dust. The time has\r\nnow come. Raise the banners and bow to them if your conscience is still\r\nwithin you.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI had finished. Kerensky rose, shook hands with me, and said: \"Thank\r\nyou, General, for your outspoken and sincere speech.\"\r\n\r\nIn the evidence which Kerensky subsequently gave to the High\r\nCommission for the investigation of Kornilov's movement, the Prime\r\nMinister explained this gesture by the fact that he approved, not of\r\nthe contents of my speech, but of my courage, and that he wished to\r\nemphasise his respect for every independent opinion, albeit entirely\r\ndivergent from the views of the Provisional Government. In substance,\r\naccording to Kerensky, \"General Deniken had for the first time drawn\r\na plan for the Revanche--that music of the future military reaction.\"\r\nThere is in these words a deep misinterpretation. We had not forgotten\r\nthe Galician retreat of 1915 or its causes, but, at the same time,\r\nwe could not forgive Kalush and Tarnopol in 1917. It was our duty,\r\nour right, and our moral obligation not to wish for either of these\r\ncontingencies. I was followed by General Klembovsky. I had left the\r\nAssembly, and only heard the end of his speech. He described the\r\ncondition of his Front in terms almost identical to mine, with great\r\nrestraint, and came to a conclusion that could only have been prompted\r\nby deep despair: he suggested that power should be vested at the Front\r\nin a kind of peculiar triumvirate consisting of the Commander-in-Chief,\r\na Commissar, and an elected soldier....\r\n\r\nGeneral Alexeiev was unwell, spoke briefly, described the condition\r\nof the rear, of the reserves and garrison troops, and endorsed the\r\nsuggestions I had made.\r\n\r\nGeneral Ruzsky, who had been undergoing a protracted cure in the\r\nCaucasus, and was therefore out of touch with the Army, analysed the\r\nsituation such as it appeared to him from the speeches that had been\r\nmade. He quoted a series of historical comparisons between the old\r\nArmy and the new Revolutionary one with such emphasis and bluntness\r\nthat Kerensky, in replying, accused Ruzsky of advocating the return to\r\nCzarist autocracy. The new men were unable to understand the passionate\r\ngrief of an old soldier for the Army. Kerensky was probably unaware of\r\nthe fact that Ruzsky had been repudiated, and also passionately accused\r\nby the Reactionary circles of the opposite crime, for the part which he\r\nhad played in the Emperor's abdication.\r\n\r\nA telegram was read from General Kornilov, urging that capital\r\npunishment should be introduced in the rear, chiefly in order to cope\r\nwith the licentious bands of Reservists; that disciplinary powers\r\nshould be vested in the Commanding Officers; that the competence of\r\nthe Army Committees should be restricted and their responsibilities\r\nfixed; that meetings should be prohibited as well as anti-national\r\npropaganda, and visits to the Front prohibited to various delegations\r\nand agitators. All this was practically implied in my programme, but\r\nunder another shape, and was described as \"military reaction.\" But\r\nKornilov had other suggestions. He advocated that Commissars should\r\nbe introduced into the Army Corps and given the right to confirm the\r\nverdicts of the Military Revolutionary Tribunals, as well as to effect\r\na \"cleansing\" of the commanding staffs. This last proposal impressed\r\nKerensky by its \"breadth and depth of vision\"--greater than those which\r\nemanated from the \"old wiseacres,\" whom he considered intoxicated \"with\r\nthe wine of hate....\" There was an obvious misunderstanding, because\r\nKornilov's \"cleansing\" was not intended against the men of solid\r\nmilitary traditions (mistakenly identified with Monarchist Reaction),\r\nbut against the hirelings of the Revolution--unprincipled men, deprived\r\nof will-power and of the capacity of taking the responsibility upon\r\ntheir own shoulders.\r\n\r\nSavinkov, the Commissar of the South-Western Front, also spoke,\r\nexpressing his own views only. He agreed with the general description\r\nof the Front which we had given, and pointed out that it is not the\r\nfault of the Revolutionary Democracy that the soldiery of the old\r\nrégime is still distrustful of their Commanding Officers; that all is\r\nnot well with the latter from the military and political points of\r\nview, and that the main object of the new Revolutionary institutions\r\nwas to restore normal relations between these two elements of the Army.\r\n\r\nKerensky made the closing speech of the Conference. He tried to\r\njustify himself--spoke of the elemental character of the inevitable\r\n\"Democratisation\" of the Army. He blamed us for seeing in the\r\nRevolution, and in its influence upon the Russian soldier, the only\r\ncause of the _débâcle_ of July, and he severely condemned the old\r\nrégime. Finally, he gave us no definite directions for future work.\r\nThe members of the Conference dispersed with a heavy feeling of mutual\r\nmisunderstanding. I was also discouraged, but at the bottom of my heart\r\nI was pleased to think--alas! I was mistaken--that our voices had been\r\nheeded. My hopes were confirmed by a letter from Kornilov which I\r\nreceived soon after his appointment to the Supreme Command:\r\n\r\n\"I have read the Report you made at the Stavka on July 16th with deep\r\nand sincere satisfaction. I would sign such a Report with both hands;\r\nI take off my hat to you, and I am lost in admiration before your\r\nfirmness and courage. I firmly believe that, with the help of the\r\nAlmighty, we will succeed in accomplishing the task of reconstructing\r\nour beloved Army and of restoring its fighting power.\"\r\n\r\nFate has, indeed, cruelly derided our hopes!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nGENERAL KORNILOV.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo days after the Moghilev Conference General Brussilov was relieved\r\nof the Supreme Command. The attempt to give the leadership of the\r\nRussian Armies to a person who had not only given proof of the most\r\ncomplete loyalty to the Provisional Government, but had evinced\r\nsympathy with its reforms, had failed. A leader had been superseded,\r\nwho, on assuming the Supreme Command, gave utterance to the following:\r\n\r\n\"I am the leader of the Revolutionary Army, appointed to this\r\nresponsible post by the people in revolution and the Provisional\r\nGovernment, in agreement with the Petrograd Soviet of Workmen's and\r\nSoldiers' Delegates. I was the first to go over to the people, serve\r\nthe people. I will continue to serve them, will never desert them.\"[51]\r\n\r\nKerensky, in his evidence before the Commission of Inquiry, explained\r\nBrussilov's dismissal by the catastrophal condition of the Front, by\r\nthe possible development of the German offensive, the absence of a firm\r\nhand at the front, and of a definite plan; by Brussilov's inability to\r\nevaluate and forestall the complications of the military situation, and\r\nlastly, by his lack of influence over both officers and men.\r\n\r\nBe it as it may, General Brussilov's retirement from the pages of\r\nmilitary history can in no wise be regarded as a simple episode of\r\nan administrative character. _It marks a clear recognition by the\r\nGovernment of the wreck of its entire military policy._\r\n\r\nOn July 19th, by an Order of the Provisional Government, Lavr\r\nGeorgievich Kornilov, General of Infantry, was appointed to the post of\r\nSupreme Commander-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n[Map: The Russian Front in June and July, 1917]\r\n\r\nIn Chapter VII. I spoke of my meeting with Kornilov, then\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Petrograd district. The whole meaning of his\r\noccupation of this post lay in the chance of bringing the Petrograd\r\ngarrison to a sense of duty and subordination. This Kornilov failed to\r\naccomplish. A fighting General who carried fighting men with him by\r\nhis courage, coolness, and contempt of death, had nothing in common\r\nwith that mob of idlers and hucksters into which the Petrograd garrison\r\nhad been transformed. His sombre figure, his dry speech, only at\r\ntimes softened by sincere feeling, and above all, its tenour so far\r\nremoved from the bewildering slogans of the Revolution, so simple in\r\nits profession of a soldier's faith--could neither fire nor inspire\r\nthe Petrograd soldiery. Inexperienced in political chicanery, by\r\nprofession alien to those methods of political warfare which had been\r\ndeveloped by the joint efforts of the bureaucracy, party sectarianism,\r\nand the revolutionary underworld, Kornilov, as Commander-in-Chief of\r\nthe Petrograd district, could neither influence the Government nor\r\nimpress the Soviet, which, without any cause, distrusted him from the\r\nvery beginning. Kornilov would have managed to suppress the Petrograd\r\npraetorians, even if he had perished in doing so, but he could not\r\nattract them to himself.\r\n\r\nHe felt that the Petrograd atmosphere did not suit him, and when on\r\nApril 21st, the Executive Committee of the Soviet, after the first\r\nBolshevist attacks, passed a resolution that no military unit could\r\nleave barracks in arms without the permission of the Committee, it\r\nwas totally impossible for Kornilov to remain at a post which gave no\r\nrights and imposed enormous responsibilities.\r\n\r\nThere was yet another reason: the Commander-in-Chief of the Petrograd\r\ndistrict was subordinated, not to the Stavka, but to the Minister of\r\nWar. Gutchkov had left that post on April 30th, and Kornilov did not\r\nwish to remain under Kerensky, the vice-president of the Petrograd\r\nSoviet.\r\n\r\n[Map: The Russian Front till August 19th and after]\r\n\r\nThe position of the Petrograd garrison and command was so incongruous\r\nthat this painful problem had to be solved by artificial measures. On\r\nKornilov's initiative, and with General Alexeiev's full approval, the\r\nStavka, in conjunction with the Headquarters of the Petrograd District,\r\ndrew up a scheme for the organisation of the Petrograd Front, covering\r\nthe approaches to the capital through Finland and the Finnish Gulf.\r\nThis Front was to include the troops in Finland and Kronstadt, on\r\nthe coast, of the Reval fortified region and the Petrograd garrison,\r\nthe depôt battalions of which it was proposed to expand into active\r\nregiments and form into brigades; the inclusion of the Baltic Fleet was\r\nlikewise probable. Such an organisation--logical from a strategical\r\npoint of view, especially in connection with the information received\r\nof the reinforcement of the German Front on the line of advance on\r\nPetrograd--gave the Commander-in-Chief the legal right to alter the\r\ndispositions to relieve the troops at the front and behind, etc. I\r\ndo not know whether this would have really made it possible to free\r\nPetrograd from the garrison which had become a veritable scourge to\r\nthe Capital, the Provisional Government, and even (in September)\r\nto the non-Bolshevist sections of the Soviet. The Government\r\nmost thoughtlessly bound itself by a promise, given in its first\r\ndeclaration, that \"the troops which had taken part in the revolutionary\r\nmovement should not be either disarmed or moved from Petrograd.\"\r\n\r\nThis plan, however, naturally failed on Kornilov's departure, as\r\nhis successors, appointed one after another by Kerensky, were of\r\nsuch an indefinite political character, and so deficient in military\r\nexperience, that it was impossible to place them at the head of so\r\nlarge a military force.\r\n\r\nAt the end of April, just before his retirement, Gutchkov wished to\r\nmake Kornilov Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Front, a post which\r\nhad become vacant after General Ruzsky's dismissal. General Alexeiev\r\nand I were at the Conference with Thomas and the French military\r\nrepresentatives, when I was called up to the telegraph instrument to\r\ntalk with the Minister of War. As General Alexeiev remained at the\r\nmeeting, and Gutchkov was ill in bed, the negotiations, in which I\r\nacted as an intermediary, were exceedingly difficult to carry on, both\r\ntechnically and because, in view of the indirect transmission, it was\r\nnecessary to speak somewhat guardedly. Gutchkov insisted, Alexeiev\r\nrefused. No less than six times did I transmit their replies, which\r\nwere at first reserved and then more heated.\r\n\r\nGutchkov spoke of the difficulty of managing the Northern Front, which\r\nwas the most unruly, and of the need of a firm hand there. He said\r\nthat it was desirable to retain Kornilov in the immediate vicinity of\r\nPetrograd, in view of future political possibilities. Alexeiev refused\r\nflatly. He said nothing about \"political possibilities,\" basing his\r\nrefusal on the grounds of Kornilov's inadequate service qualifications\r\nfor command, and the awkwardness of passing over Senior Commanders\r\nmore experienced and acquainted with the Front, such as General Abram\r\nDragomirov, for instance. Nevertheless, when the next day an official\r\ntelegram arrived from the Ministry in connection with Kornilov's\r\nappointment, Alexeiev replied that he was uncompromisingly against\r\nit, and that if the appointment were made in spite of this, he would\r\nimmediately send in his resignation.\r\n\r\nNever had the Supreme Commander-in-Chief been so inflexible in his\r\ncommunications with Petrograd. Some persons, including Kornilov himself\r\n(as he confessed to me afterwards), involuntarily gained the impression\r\nthat the question was a somewhat wider basis one than that of the\r\nappointment of the Commander-in-Chief ... that the fear of a future\r\ndictator played a certain part. However, this supposition is flatly\r\ncontradicted by placing this episode in conjunction with the fact that\r\nthe Petrograd Front was created for Kornilov--a fact that was of no\r\nless importance and fraught with possibilities.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of May Kornilov took over the 8th Army on\r\nthe South-Western Front. General Dragomirov was appointed\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Northern Front.\r\n\r\nThis is the second event which gives the key to the understanding of\r\nthe subsequent relations between Alexeiev and Kornilov.\r\n\r\nAccording to Kornilov, the 8th Army was in a state of complete\r\ndisintegration when he assumed command. \"For two months,\" says he, \"I\r\nhad to visit the units nearly every day and personally explain to the\r\nsoldiers the necessity for discipline, encourage the officers, and\r\nurge upon the troops the necessity of an advance.... Here I became\r\nconvinced that firm language from the Commander and definite action\r\nwere necessary in order to arrest the disintegration of our Army. I\r\nunderstood that such language was expected both by the officers and the\r\nmen, the more reasonable of whom were already tired of the complete\r\nanarchy....\"\r\n\r\nUnder what conditions Kornilov made his rounds we have already shown\r\nin Chapter XXIII. I hardly think that he managed to arouse the mass\r\nof soldiers to consciousness. The Kalush of June 28th and the Kalush\r\nof July 8th show the 8th Army equally as heroes and as beasts. The\r\nofficers and a small part of the real soldiers, however, were more\r\nthan ever under the spell of Kornilov's personality. Its power\r\nincreased among the non-Socialistic sections of the Russian public\r\nlikewise. When, after the rout of July 6th, General Gutor--who had been\r\nappointed to the highly responsible post of Commander-in-Chief of the\r\nSouth-Western Front, merely not to resist the democratisation of the\r\nArmy--yielded to despair and collapsed, there was no one to replace\r\nhim except Kornilov (on the night of July 8th).... The spectre of the\r\n\"General on a White Horse\" was already looming in sight and disturbing\r\nthe spiritual peace of many.\r\n\r\nBrussilov was strongly opposed to this appointment. Kerensky hesitated\r\nfor a moment. The position, however, was catastrophical. Kornilov\r\nwas bold, courageous, stern, resolute and independent, and would\r\nnever hesitate to show initiative or to undertake any responsibility\r\nif circumstances required it. Kerensky was of the opinion[52] that\r\nKornilov's downright qualities, though dangerous in case of success,\r\nwould be only too useful in case of a panic-stricken retreat. And \"when\r\nthe Moor has done his work, let the Moor go....\" So Kerensky insisted\r\non Kornilov's appointment as Commander-in-Chief of the South-Western\r\nFront.\r\n\r\nOn the third day after taking over his duties, Kornilov wired to the\r\nProvisional Government: \"I declare that if the Government does not\r\nconfirm the measures proposed by me, and deprives me of the only means\r\nof saving the Army and of using it for its real purpose of defending\r\nthe Motherland and liberty, then I, General Kornilov, will of my own\r\naccord lay down my authority as Commander-in-Chief....\"\r\n\r\nA series of political telegrams from Kornilov produced a profound\r\nimpression on the country, and inspired some with fear, some with hate,\r\nand others with hope. Kerensky hesitated, but what about the support\r\nof the Commissars and Committees? The tranquilisation and reduction\r\nto order of the South-Western Front attained, among other means, by\r\nKornilov's bold, resolute struggle against the Army Bolsheviks? The\r\noppressive isolation felt by the Minister of War after the conference\r\nof July 16th? The uselessness of retaining Brussilov as Supreme\r\nCommander-in-Chief and the hopelessness of placing at the head of the\r\nArmy Generals of the new type, as shown by the experiment of appointing\r\nBrussilov and Gutor? Savinkov's persistent advice? Such were the\r\nreasons which forced Kerensky--who fully recognised the inevitability\r\nof the coming collision with the man who repudiated his military policy\r\nwith every fibre of his soul--to decide on the appointment of Kornilov\r\nto the post of Supreme Commander-in-Chief. There is not the slightest\r\ndoubt that Kerensky did this in a fit of despair. Probably it was the\r\nsame feeling of fatality that induced him to appoint Savinkov acting\r\nMinister of War.\r\n\r\nThe collisions occurred sooner than might have been expected. On\r\nreceiving the order for his appointment, Kornilov at once sent the\r\nProvisional Government a telegram \"reporting\" that he could accept\r\ncommand and \"lead the nation to victory and to the prospect of a just\r\nand honourable peace only on the following conditions:\r\n\r\n    \"(1) Responsibility to his own conscience and to the whole nation.\r\n\r\n    \"(2) Complete non-interference with his orders relating to military\r\n    operations and, therefore, with the appointment of the Higher\r\n    Command.\r\n\r\n    \"(3) The application of the measures recently introduced at the\r\n    Front to all places in the rear where drafts for the Army were\r\n    quartered.\r\n\r\n    \"(4) Acceptance of his proposals telegraphed to the Conference at\r\n    the Stavka on July 16th.\"\r\n\r\nWhen in due course I read this telegram in the newspapers, I was not\r\na little surprised at the first condition, which established a highly\r\noriginal form of suzerainty on the part of the Supreme Command until\r\nthe convocation of the Constituent Assembly. I waited impatiently for\r\nthe official reply. There was none. As it turned out, on receiving\r\nKornilov's ultimatum, the Council of the Government hotly debated\r\nthe matter, and Kerensky demanded that the prestige of the High\r\nCommand should be upheld by the immediate removal of the new Supreme\r\nCommander-in-Chief. The Government did not agree to this, and Kerensky,\r\nignoring the other points mentioned in the telegram, replied only to\r\nthe second, by recognising the right of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief\r\nto select his own direct assistants.\r\n\r\nDiverging from the established procedure of appointments, the\r\nGovernment, simultaneously with Kornilov's appointment and without\r\nhis knowledge, issued an order appointing General Cheremissov\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the South-Western Front. Kornilov regarded this\r\nas a complete violation of his rights, and sent another ultimatum,\r\ndeclaring that he could continue to hold Supreme Command only on\r\ncondition of Cheremissov's immediate removal. He declined to go\r\nto Moghilev before this question was settled. Cheremissov, on his\r\npart, was very \"nervy,\" and threatened to \"bomb his way\" into Front\r\nHeadquarters and to establish his rights as Commander-in-Chief.\r\n\r\nThis complicated matters still further, and Kornilov reported by\r\nwire[53] to Petrograd that, in his opinion, it would be more regular\r\nto dismiss Cheremissov. \"For the purpose of strengthening discipline\r\nin the Army, we decided to take severe measures with the soldiers; the\r\nsame measures must likewise apply to the higher military commanders.\"\r\n\r\nThe Revolution had upset all mutual relations and the very essence\r\nof discipline. As a soldier, I was bound to see in all this the\r\nundermining of the authority of the Provisional Government (if such\r\nexisted), and I could not but recognise that it was both the right and\r\nthe duty of the Government to make everyone respect its authority.\r\n\r\nAs a chronicler, however, I must add that the military leaders had no\r\nother means of stopping this disintegration of the Army, proceeding\r\nfrom above. And had the Government actually possessed the power, and\r\nin full panoply of right and might had been able to assert itself,\r\nthere would have been no ultimatums either from the Soviet or from the\r\nmilitary leaders. Furthermore, there would have been no need for the\r\nevents of the 27th of August, and those of the 25th of October would\r\nhave been impossible.\r\n\r\nThe matter finally resolved itself into the arrival of Commissar\r\nFilonenko at Front Headquarters. He informed Kornilov that all his\r\nrecommendations had been accepted by the Government, in principle,\r\nwhile Cheremissov was placed at the disposal of the Provisional\r\nGovernment. General Balnev was hastily, at random, selected to command\r\nthe South-Western Front, and Kornilov assumed the Supreme Command on\r\nthe 27th of July.\r\n\r\nThe spectre of the \"General on the White Horse\" became more and more\r\nclearly visible. And the eyes of many, suffering at the sight of the\r\nmadness and the shame now engulfing Russia, were again and again\r\nturned to this spectre. Honest and dishonest, sincere and insincere,\r\npoliticians, soldiers and adventurers, all turned to it. And all with\r\none voice cried out, \"Save Us!\"\r\n\r\nHe, the stern and straightforward soldier, deeply patriotic, untried in\r\npolitics, knowing little of men, hypnotised both by truth and flattery,\r\nand by the general longing expectation of someone's coming, moved by\r\na fervent desire for deeds of sacrifice--he truly believed in the\r\npredestined nature of his appointment. He lived and fought with this\r\nbelief, and died for it on the banks of the Kuban.\r\n\r\nKornilov became a sign and rallying point. To some, of\r\ncounter-Revolution; to others, of the salvation of their native land.\r\n\r\nAround this point a struggle for influence and power was commenced by\r\npeople who, unaided, without him could not have attained to such power.\r\n\r\nA characteristic episode had already taken place on the 8th of July,\r\nat Kamenetz-Podolsk. Here, in Kornilov's entourage, there occurred the\r\nfirst conflict between Savinkov and Zavoiko, the former being the most\r\nprominent Russian Revolutionary, leader of the Terrorist fighting group\r\nof the Social-Revolutionary Party, organiser of the most notorious\r\npolitical assassinations--those of Plehve, Minister of the Interior,\r\nof the Grand Duke Serge, etc. Strong-willed and cruel by nature,\r\ncompletely lacking in the controlling influences of \"conventional\r\nmorality,\" despising both the Provisional Government and Kerensky,\r\nsupporting the Provisional Government from motives of expediency, as\r\nhe understood it, ready at any moment to sweep them aside--he saw in\r\nKornilov merely a weapon in the fight for Revolutionary power, in\r\nwhich _he_ must have a dominant interest. Zavoiko was one of those\r\npeculiar personages who afterwards clustered closely round Kornilov and\r\nplayed such a prominent part in the August days. He was not very well\r\nknown even to Kornilov. The latter stated, in his evidence before the\r\nSupreme Commission of Inquiry, that he became acquainted with Zavoiko\r\nin April, 1917; that Zavoiko had been \"marechal de noblesse\" of the\r\nHaisin district of Podolia, had been employed on the Nobel oilfields in\r\nBaku, and, by his own statements, had been employed in prospecting for\r\nminerals in Turkestan and Western Siberia. He arrived in Czernowitz,\r\nenrolled as a volunteer in the Daghestan Mounted Regiment, and was\r\nretained at Army Headquarters as personal aide to Kornilov. That is all\r\nthat is known of Zavoiko's past.\r\n\r\nKornilov's first telegram to the Provisional Government was edited by\r\nZavoiko, who \"gave it the form of an ultimatum with a concealed threat,\r\nin case of non-compliance with the demands presented to the Provisional\r\nGovernment, to proclaim a military dictatorship on the South-Western\r\nFront.\"[54]\r\n\r\nI discovered all this subsequently. During all these events I continued\r\nworking at Minsk, completely engrossed now, not by the offensive,\r\nbut by the organisation of any sort of skeleton defence of the\r\nhalf-collapsed Front. There was no information, no rumours even, of\r\nwhat was going on at the head of affairs. Only an increased tension was\r\nnoticeable in all official relations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nQuite unexpectedly, in the end of July the Stavka offered me the post\r\nof Commander-in-Chief of the South-Western Front. I communicated\r\nby wire with General Lukomsky, the Chief-of-Staff of the Supreme\r\nCommander-in-Chief, and told him that I should obey orders and go\r\nwherever I was sent, but would like to know the reason for this\r\nexchange. If the reasons were political I should ask to be left at my\r\nold post. Lukomsky assured me that what Kornilov had in view was only\r\nthe military importance of the South-Western Front and the proposed\r\nstrategical operations in that quarter. I accepted the post.\r\n\r\nI parted from my assistants with regret, and, having transferred my\r\nfriend, General Markov, to the new front, left for my new place of\r\nservice together with him. On my way I stopped at Moghilev. The Stavka\r\nwas in a very optimistic mood; everyone was animated and hopeful, but\r\nthere were no signs of any \"underground\" conspiratory working. It\r\nshould be mentioned that in this respect the military were so naïvely\r\ninexperienced, that when they really began to \"conspire\" their work\r\ntook such _obvious_ forms that the deaf could not help hearing, nor the\r\nblind seeing, what was going on.\r\n\r\nOn the day of our arrival Kornilov held a Council of the Chiefs of\r\nDepartments of the Stavka, at which the so-called \"Kornilov programme\"\r\nfor the restoration of the Army was discussed. I was invited to attend.\r\nI shall not repeat all the fundamental propositions, which have already\r\nbeen mentioned both by me and in Kornilov's telegrams--such demands,\r\nfor instance, as the introduction of Revolutionary courts-martial\r\nand capital punishment in the rear, the restoration of disciplinary\r\nauthority to Commanders and raising their prestige, the limitation\r\nof the activity of the Committees and their responsibility, etc. I\r\nremember that side by side with clear and irrefutable propositions--the\r\ndraft memorandum drawn up by the Departments of the Stavka--there\r\nwere bureaucratic lucubrations hardly applicable in actual life.\r\nFor instance, with the object of making disciplinary authority more\r\npalatable to Revolutionary Democracy, the authors of the memorandum had\r\ndrawn up a curiously detailed list of disciplinary misdemeanour with a\r\ncorresponding scale of penalties. And this was meant for the seething\r\nwhirlpool of life, where all relations were trampled underfoot, all\r\nstandards violated, where every fresh day brought forward an endless\r\nvariety of departures from the regulations!\r\n\r\nAt any rate, the Supreme Command was finding the proper path, and\r\napparently Kornilov's personality was a guarantee that the Government\r\nwould be obliged to follow that path. Undoubtedly a long struggle with\r\nthe Soviets, Committees, and soldiery was still to be waged, but,\r\nat least, the definiteness of the policy gave moral support and a\r\ntangible basis for this heavy task in the future. On the other hand,\r\nthe support given to Kornilov's measures by Savinkov's War Ministry\r\ngave reason to hope that Kerensky's vacillations and indecision would\r\nfinally be overcome. The attitude to this question of the Provisional\r\nGovernment as a whole was of no practical importance, and could not\r\neven be officially expressed. At that time it seemed as if Kerensky\r\nhad, in some degree, freed himself from the yoke of the Soviet, but,\r\njust as formerly all the most important questions of State had been\r\nsettled by him apart from the Government, in conjunction with the\r\nleading Soviet circles, now, in August, the direction of State affairs\r\npassed into the hands of a triumvirate composed of Kerensky, Nekrassov,\r\nand Tereschenko, leaving both the Socialist and Liberal groups of the\r\nGovernment out of the running.\r\n\r\nAfter the meeting was over Kornilov asked me to stay, and, when all had\r\nleft, said to me, almost in a whisper: \"It is necessary to struggle,\r\notherwise the country will perish. N. came to see me at the Front. He\r\nis nursing his scheme of a _coup d'état_ and of placing the Grand-Duke\r\nDmitri on the throne. He is organising something or other, and has\r\nsuggested collaboration. I told him flatly that I would take no part\r\nin any Romanov adventures. The Government itself understands that it\r\ncan do nothing. They have offered my joining in the Government.... No,\r\nthank you! These gentlemen are far too much entangled with the Soviets,\r\nand cannot decide on anything. I have told them that if authority is\r\ngiven me I shall carry on a decisive struggle. We must lead Russia to\r\na Constituent Assembly, and then let them do what they like. I shall\r\nstand aside and not interfere in any way. Now, General, may I rely on\r\nyour support?\"\r\n\r\n\"To the fullest extent.\"\r\n\r\nThis was my second meeting and my second conversation with Kornilov.\r\nWe embraced heartily and parted ... only to meet again in the Bykhov\r\nPrison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\n    MY SERVICE AS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE SOUTH-WESTERN FRONT--THE\r\n    MOSCOW CONFERENCE--THE FALL OF RIGA.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was touched by General Alexeiev's letter:\r\n\r\n\"My thoughts are with you in your new appointment. I consider that\r\nyou have been sent to perform a superhuman task. Much has been said,\r\nbut apparently little has been done there. Nothing has been done even\r\nafter the 16th July by Russia's chief babbler.... The authority of\r\nthe Commanders is being steadily curtailed. Should you want my help\r\nin anything I am ready to go to Berdichev, to go to the Front, to one\r\nCommand or another.... God preserve you!\"\r\n\r\nHere was a man, indeed, whom neither an exalted position nor\r\nmisfortunes could change. He was full of his modest, disinterested work\r\nfor the good of his native land.\r\n\r\nA new front, new men. The South-Western Front, shaken by the events\r\nin July, was gradually recovering. Not, however, in the sense of real\r\nconvalescence, as the optimists thought, but of a return approximately\r\nto its condition prior to the offensive. There were the same strained\r\nrelations between officers and men, the same slip-shod service, the\r\ndesertion, and open unwillingness to fight, which was only less\r\nactively expressed owing to the lull in operations; finally there was\r\nthe same Bolshevist propaganda, only more active, and not infrequently\r\ndisguised under the form of Committee \"fractions\" and preparations for\r\nthe Constituent Assembly. I have a document referring to the 2nd Army\r\nof the Western Front. It is highly characteristic as an indication\r\nof the unparalleled toleration and, indeed, encouragement of the\r\ndisintegration of the Army on the part of the representatives of the\r\nGovernment and Commanders, under the guise of liberty and conscious\r\nvoting at the elections. Here is a copy of the telegram sent to all the\r\nsenior officers of the 2nd Army:\r\n\r\n    The Army Commander, in agreement with the Commissar, and at the\r\n    request of the Army fraction of the Bolshevist Social-Democrats,\r\n    has permitted the organisation, from the 15th to 18th October, of\r\n    preparatory courses for instructors of the aforesaid fraction for\r\n    the elections to the Constituent Assembly, one representative of\r\n    the Bolshevist organisation of each separate unit being sent to the\r\n    said courses. No. 1644.\r\n\r\n                                                            SUVOROV.[55]\r\n\r\nThe same toleration had been exercised in many cases previously, and\r\nwas founded on the exact meaning of the regulations for Army Committees\r\nand of the \"Declaration of Soldiers' Rights.\"\r\n\r\nCarried away by the struggle against counter-revolution, the\r\nRevolutionary institutions had paid no attention to such facts as\r\npublic meetings with extreme Bolshevist watchwords being held at the\r\nvery place where the Front Headquarters were situated, or that the\r\nlocal paper, _Svobodnaia Mysl_,[56] most undisguisedly threatened the\r\nofficers with a St. Bartholomew's Eve.\r\n\r\nThe front was _holding out_. That is all that could be said of the\r\nsituation. At times there would be disturbances ending tragically,\r\nsuch as the brutal murder of Generals Girshfeld, Hirschfeld, and\r\nStefanovich, Commissar Linde. The preliminary arrangements and the\r\nconcentration of the troops for the coming partial offensive were made,\r\nbut there was no possibility of launching the actual attack until the\r\n\"Kornilov programme\" had been put into practice and the results known.\r\n\r\nI waited very impatiently.\r\n\r\nThe Revolutionary organisations (the Commissariat and Committee) of\r\nthe South-Western Front were in a position; they had not yet seized\r\npower, but some of it had already been yielded to them voluntarily by\r\na series of Commanders-in-Chief--Brussilov, Gutor, Baluev. Therefore,\r\nmy coming at once roused their antagonism. The Committee of the Western\r\nFront lost no time in sending a scathing report on me to Berdichev on\r\nthe basis of which the next issue of the Committee's organ published an\r\nimpressive warning to the \"enemies of democracy.\" As usual, I totally\r\nomitted to invoke the aid of the Commissariat, and sent a message to\r\nthe Committee saying that I could have nothing to do with it unless it\r\nkept rigidly within the limits of the law.\r\n\r\nThe Commissar of the Front was a certain Gobechio. I saw him once only,\r\non my arrival. In a few days he got transferred to the Caucasus, and\r\nhis post was taken by Iordansky.[57] As soon as he arrived he issued\r\nan \"order to the troops at the Front.\" Afterwards he was unable to\r\nunderstand that two persons could not command the Front at one and the\r\nsame time. Iordansky and his assistants, Kostitsin and Grigorier--a\r\nliterary man, zoologist, and doctor respectively--were probably rather\r\nprominent men in their own profession, but utterly ignorant of military\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe Committee of the Front was no better and no worse than others.[58]\r\nIt took the \"Defencist\" point of view, and even supported the\r\nrepressive measures taken by Kornilov in July, but at that time\r\nthe Committee was not in the least degree a _military_ institution\r\norganically connected--for good or evil--with the true Army life. It\r\nwas merely a mixed party organ. Divided into \"fractions\" of all the\r\nSocialist parties, the Committee positively revelled in politics,\r\nand introduced them at the Front likewise. The Committee carried on\r\npropaganda on a large scale, convened congresses of representatives in\r\norder to have them converted by Socialist fractions, including such\r\nas were openly antagonistic to the policy of the Government. I made\r\nan attempt to stop this work in view of the impending strategical\r\noperations and the difficult period of transition, but met with\r\ndetermined opposition on the part of Commissar Iordansky. At the same\r\ntime, the Committee was perpetually interfering in all questions of\r\nmilitary authority, spreading sedition and distrust to the commanders.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, both in Petrograd and Moghilev, events were taking their\r\ncourse, and we could grasp their meaning only in so far as they were\r\nreflected by newspaper reports, rumours and gossip.\r\n\r\nThere was still no \"programme.\" The Moscow State Conference[59] raised\r\ngreat hopes, but it met without making any changes in either State\r\nor military policy. On the contrary, it even outwardly emphasises\r\nthe irreconcilable enmity between the Revolutionary Democracy and\r\nthe Liberal Bourgeoisie, between the Commanders and the soldiers'\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\nIf the Moscow Conference yielded no positive results, nevertheless, it\r\nfully exposed the mood of the opponents, the leaders and the rulers.\r\nAll unanimously recognised that the country was in deadly peril.\r\nEveryone understood that the social relations had suffered an upheaval,\r\nthat all branches of the nation's economy had been uprooted. Each\r\nparty reproached the other with supporting the selfish interests of\r\ntheir class. This, however, was not the most important matter, for,\r\nstrange as it may seem, the primary causes of social class war, even\r\nthe agrarian and labour questions, merely led to disagreement, without\r\nrousing any irreconcilable dissentions. Even when Plekhanov, the\r\nold leader of the Social-Democrats, amid universal approval, turned to\r\nthe Right demanding sacrifice, and to the Left demanding moderation, it\r\nseemed as if the chasm between the two opposing social camps was not so\r\nvery great.\r\n\r\nAll the attention of the Conference was taken up by other questions,\r\nthose of _authority and of the Army_.\r\n\r\nMiliukov enumerated all the sins of the Government, vanquished by the\r\nSoviets, its \"capitulation\" to the ideology of the Socialist parties\r\nand Zimmerwaldists, capitulation in the Army, in foreign policy, to\r\nthe Utopian demands of the working classes, to the extreme demands of\r\nnationalities.\r\n\r\n\"The usurpation of the authority of the State by Central and Local\r\nCommittees and Soviets,\" said General Kaledin distinctly, \"must be\r\nstopped at once and decisively.\"\r\n\r\nMaklakov smoothed the way for his attack: \"I demand nothing, but\r\nI cannot help drawing attention to the alarm felt by the social\r\nconscience when it sees that the 'Defeatists' of yesterday have been\r\ninvited to join the Government.\" Shulgin (Right) is agitated. He says:\r\n\"I want your (the Provisional Government's) authority to be really\r\nstrong, really unlimited. I want this, though I know that a strong\r\nGovernment easily turns to despotism, which is more likely to crush me\r\nthan you, the friends of that Government.\"\r\n\r\nOn the Left, Jehkheidze sings the praises of the Soviets: \"It is only\r\nowing to the Revolutionary organisations that the creative spirit of\r\nthe Revolution has been preserved, for the salvation of the country\r\nfrom the disintegration of authority and from anarchy....\" \"There\r\nis no power higher than that of the Provisional Governments,\" says\r\nTzeretelli, \"because the source of this power the sovereign people\r\nhas, through all the organs at its disposal, directly delegated this\r\npower to the Provisional Government.\" Of course, in so far as that\r\nGovernment submits to the will of the Soviets?... And over all one\r\nhears the dominating voice of the President of the Congress, who is\r\nseeking for \"heavenly words\" in order to \"express his shuddering\r\nhorror\" at coming events, \"and at the same time brandishing a wooden\r\nsword and threatening his hidden enemies thus: 'Be it known to everyone\r\nwho has once tried to offer armed resistance to the authority of the\r\npeople that the attempt will be smothered in blood and iron. Let those\r\nbeware who think that the time has come for them to overthrow the\r\nRevolutionary Government with the help of bayonets.'\"\r\n\r\nThe contradiction was still more striking in military matters. In a dry\r\nbut powerful speech, the Supreme Commander-in-Chief drew a picture of\r\nthe destruction of the Army, involving the whole country in its ruin,\r\nand with great reserve explained the gist of his programme. General\r\nAlexeiev related, with genuine bitterness, the sad story of the sins,\r\nsufferings and gallantry of the former Army.\r\n\r\n\"Weak in technical resources and morally strong in spirit and\r\ndiscipline,\" he related how the Army had lived to see the bright\r\ndays of the Revolution, and how later on, \"when it was thought to be\r\na danger to the conquests of the Revolution, it was inoculated with\r\ndeadly poison.\" Kaledin, the Don Cossack Attaman, representing thirteen\r\nCossack Armies and unhampered by any official position, spoke sharply\r\nand distinctly: \"The Army must keep out of politics. There must be no\r\npolitical meetings with their party struggles and disputes. All the\r\n(Army) Soviets and Committees must be abolished. The Declaration of\r\nSoldiers' Rights must be revised. Discipline must be raised both at the\r\nFront and in the rear. The disciplinary authority of the Commanders\r\nmust be restored. All power to the leaders of the Army!\"\r\n\r\nKuchin, the representative of the Army and Front Committees, rose\r\nto reply to these trite military axioms. \"The Committees were a\r\nmanifestation of the instinct of self-defence.... They had to be formed\r\nas organs for the protection of the privates, as hitherto there had\r\nbeen nothing but oppression ... the Committees had brought light and\r\nknowledge to the soldiers.... Then came the second period--one of decay\r\nand disorganisation ... 'rearguard consciousness' made its appearance,\r\nbut failed to digest all the mass of questions which the Revolutions\r\nhad raised in the minds of the soldiery....\" Now the speaker did\r\nnot deny the necessity for repressive measures, but they \"must be\r\ncompatible with the definite work of Army organisations....\" How this\r\nwas to be done had been shown by the united front of Revolutionary\r\nDemocracy, namely, the Army must be animated, not by the desire of\r\nvictory over the enemy, but by \"a repudiation of Imperialistic aims,\r\nand a desire for the speedy attainment of universal peace on Democratic\r\nprinciples.... The commanders should possess complete independence\r\nin the conduct of military operations, and have a decisive voice in\r\nquestions of discipline and service training.\" The object of the\r\norganisations, on the other hand, was to introduce their policy\r\nwholesale among troops, and \"the Commissars must be the introducers\r\nof (this) single Revolutionary policy of the Provisional Government,\r\nthe Army Committees must direct the social and political life of\r\nthe soldiers. The restoration of the disciplinary authority of the\r\ncommanders is not to be thought of,\" etc.\r\n\r\nWhat is the Government going to do? Will it find enough strength\r\nand boldness to burst the fetters placed on it by the Bolshevistic\r\nSoviet?[60]\r\n\r\nKornilov said firmly, repeating his words twice: \"I do not doubt for a\r\nmoment that the (my) measures will be carried out without delay.\"\r\n\r\nAnd if not--was it to be War?\r\n\r\nHe also said: \"It is impossible to admit that the determination to\r\ncarry out these measures should in every case be aroused merely by the\r\npressure of defeats and loss of territory. If the rout at Tarnopol and\r\nthe loss of Galicia and Bukovina did indeed result in restoration of\r\ndiscipline at the Front, it cannot be admitted that order in the rear\r\nshould be restored at the cost of the loss of Riga, and that order\r\non the railways should be restored by the cession of Moldavia and\r\nBessarabia to the enemy.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 20th Riga fell.\r\n\r\nBoth strategically and tactically the Front of the lower Dvina was in\r\ncomplete preparedness. Taking into consideration the strength of the\r\ndefensive positions, the forces were also sufficient. The officers in\r\ncommand were General Parsky, Army Commander, and General Boldyrev,\r\nCorps Commander; both experienced Generals, and certainly not inclined\r\nto counter-Revolution in the opinion of the Democrats.[61]\r\n\r\nFinally, from deserters' reports, our Headquarters knew not only the\r\ndirection but even the day and the hour of the contemplated attack.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, on the 19th August the Germans (Von Hutier's 8th Army),\r\nafter heavy artillery preparation, occupied the Uxküll bridgehead in\r\nthe face of feeble opposition on our part, and crossed the Dvina. On\r\n20th August the Germans assumed the offensive also along the Mitau\r\nroad; towards evening of the same day the enemy's Uxküll group,\r\nhaving pierced our lines on the Egel, began deploying in a northerly\r\ndirection, threatening the retreat of the Russian troops towards\r\nWenden. The 12th Army, abandoning Riga, retired some 60-70 versts,\r\nlosing touch with the enemy, and on the 25th occupied the so-called\r\nWenden position. The Army lost in prisoners alone some 9,000 men,\r\nbesides 81 guns, 200 machine-guns, etc. A further advance did not enter\r\ninto the German plans, and they commenced to establish themselves on\r\nthe extensive terrain of the right bank of the Dvina, immediately\r\nsending off two divisions to the Western Front.\r\n\r\nWe lost the rich industrial town of Riga, with all its military\r\nstructures and supplies; more important still, we lost a safe defensive\r\nline, the abandonment of which placed both the Dvina Front and the way\r\nto Petrograd under a constant threat.\r\n\r\nThe fall of Riga made a great impression in the country. Quite\r\nunexpectedly, however, it called forth from the Revolutionary\r\nDemocracy, not repentance, not patriotic fervour, but, instead, a still\r\ngreater bitterness towards the leaders and officers. The Stavka in one\r\n_communiqué_[62] inserted the following sentence: \"The disorganised\r\nmasses of the soldiery are flocking in uncontrollable masses along\r\nthe Pskov high road and the road to Bieder-Limburg.\" This statement,\r\nundoubtedly true, and neither mentioning nor relating to the causes\r\nof the above, raised a storm amongst the Revolutionary Democracy.\r\nThe Commissars and Committees of the Northern Front sent a series of\r\ntelegrams refuting the \"provocative attacks of the Stavka\" and assuring\r\nthat \"there was no shame in this reverse\"; that \"the troops honestly\r\nobey all demands of their leaders ... there have been no cases of\r\nflight or treachery on the part of the troops.\"\r\n\r\nThe Commissar for the Front, Stankevitch, while demurring against there\r\nbeing no shame in such a causeless and inglorious retreat, pointed\r\nout, amongst other things, a series of errors and delinquencies on\r\nthe part of the Commanders. It is extremely possible that there were\r\nerrors, both personal and of leadership, as well as purely objective\r\ndeficiencies, caused by mutual mistrust, slackening of obedience,\r\nand the _débâcle_ of the technical services. At the same time, it\r\nis undoubtedly a fact that the troops of the Northern Front, and\r\nespecially the 12th Army, were the most disorganised of all, and,\r\nlogically, could not offer the necessary resistance. Even the apologist\r\nof the 12th Army, Commissar Voitinsky, who always considerably\r\nexaggerated the fighting value of these troops, telegraphed on the\r\n22nd to the Petrograd Soviet: \"The troops show want of confidence in\r\ntheir powers, absence of training for battle, and, consequently,\r\ninsufficient steadiness in open warfare.... Many units fight bravely,\r\nas in the early days; others show signs of weariness and panic.\"\r\n\r\nActually, the debauched Northern Front had lost all power of\r\nresistance. The troops rolled back to the limit of pursuit by the\r\nGerman advanced detachments, and only moved forward subsequently\r\non losing touch with Hutier's main body, which had no intention of\r\npassing, beyond a definite line.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, all the papers of the Left commenced a fierce campaign\r\nagainst the Stavka and the Commands. The word \"treachery\" was heard....\r\nTchernov's _Delo Naroda_, a Defeatist paper, complained: \"A torturing\r\nfear creeps into the mind: are not the mistakes of the commanders,\r\nthe deficiencies in artillery, and the incapacity of the leaders\r\nbeing unloaded on to the soldiers--courageous, heroic, perishing\r\nin thousands.\" The _Izvestia_ announced also the motives for the\r\n\"provocation\": \"The Stavka, by putting forth the bogy of menacing\r\nevents, is trying to terrorise the Provisional Government and make\r\nit adopt a series of measures, directly and indirectly aimed at the\r\nRevolutionary Democracy and their organisations....\"\r\n\r\nIn conjunction with all these events, the feeling against the Supreme\r\nCommander-in-Chief, General Kornilov, was increasing in the Soviets,\r\nand rumours of his approaching dismissal appeared in the Press. In\r\nanswer to these, a series of angry resolutions addressed to the\r\nGovernment, and supporting Kornilov, made their appearance.[63] The\r\nresolution of the Council of the Union of Cossack Troops contained even\r\nthe following passage: \"The supersession of Kornilov will inevitably\r\nimbue the Cossacks with the fatal impression of the futility of further\r\nCossack sacrifices\"; and, further, that the Council \"declines all\r\nresponsibility for the Cossack troops at and behind the Front should\r\nKornilov be removed.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was, then, the situation. Instead of pacification, passions burned\r\nfiercer, contradictions increased, the atmosphere of mutual mistrust\r\nand morbid suspicion was thickened.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI still postponed my tour of the troops, not abandoning hope of a\r\nsatisfactory issue to the struggle and of the publication of the\r\n\"Kornilov programme.\"[64]\r\n\r\nWhat could I bring the men? A deep, painful feeling, words appealing to\r\n\"common-sense and conscience,\" concealing my helplessness, and like the\r\nvoice of one crying in the wilderness? All had been and gone, leaving\r\nbitter memories behind. It will always be so: thoughts, ideas, words,\r\nmoral persuasion will never cease to rouse men to deeds of merit; but\r\nwhat if overgrown, virgin soil must be torn up with an iron plough?...\r\nWhat should I say to the officers, sorrowfully and patiently awaiting\r\nthe end of the regular and merciless lingering death of the Army? For I\r\ncould only say to them: If the Government does not radically alter its\r\npolicy the end of the Army has come.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th August orders were received to move the Caucasian Native\r\n(\"Wild\") Division from under my command northwards; on the 12th the\r\nsame order was received for the 3rd Cavalry Corps, then in Reserve, and\r\nlater for the Kornilov \"shock\" Regiment. As always, their destination\r\nwas not indicated. The direction prescribed, on the other hand, equally\r\npointed to the Northern Front, at that time greatly threatened, and\r\nto ... Petrograd. I recommended General Krymov, commanding the 3rd\r\nCavalry Corps, for the command of the 11th Army. The Stavka agreed, but\r\ndemanded his immediate departure for Moghilev on a special mission. On\r\nhis way there Krymov reported to me. Apparently he had not yet received\r\ndefinite instructions--at any rate, he spoke of none; however, neither\r\nhe nor I doubted that the mission was in connection with the expected\r\nchange in military policy. Krymov was at this time cheerful and\r\nconfident, and had faith in the future; as formerly, he considered that\r\nonly a crushing blow to the Soviets could save the situation.\r\n\r\nFollowing on this, official information was received of the formation\r\nof the Detached Petrograd Army, and the appointment of an officer of\r\nthe General Staff to be Quartermaster-General of this Army was desired.\r\n\r\nFinally, about the 20th, the situation became somewhat clearer. An\r\nofficer reported to me at Berdichev, and handed me a personal letter\r\nfrom Kornilov, wherein the latter suggested I should hear this\r\nofficer's verbal report. He stated as follows:\r\n\r\n\"According to reliable information, a rising of the Bolsheviks\r\nwill take place at the end of August. By this time the 3rd Cavalry\r\nCorps,[65] commanded by Krymov, would reach Petrograd, would crush\r\nthe rising, and simultaneously put an end to the Soviets.\"[66]\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, Petrograd would be proclaimed in a state of war, and\r\nthe laws resulting from the \"Kornilov programme\" would be published.\r\nThe Supreme Commander-in-Chief requested me to despatch to the\r\nStavka a score or more of reliable officers--officially \"for trench\r\nmortar instruction\"; actually they would be sent to Petrograd, and\r\nincorporated in the Officers' Detachment.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the conversation he communicated the news from the\r\nStavka, painting all in glowing colours. He told me, among other\r\nthings, of rumours concerning new appointments to the Kiev, Odessa and\r\nMoscow commands, and of the proposed new Government, mentioning some\r\nexisting ministers, and some names entirely unknown to me. The part\r\nplayed in this matter by the Provisional Government, in particular by\r\nKerensky, was not clear. Had he decided on an abrupt change of military\r\npolicy, would he resign, or would he be swept away by developments\r\nimpossible of prediction by pure logic, or the most prophetic common\r\nsense?\r\n\r\n_In this volume I described the entire course of events during August\r\nin that sequence and in that light, in which these tragic days were\r\nexperienced on the South-Western Front, not giving them the perspective\r\nof the stage and the actors acquired subsequently._\r\n\r\nThe seconding of the officers--with all precautions to prevent\r\neither them or their superiors being placed in a false position--was\r\ncommenced, but it is hardly likely that it could have been accomplished\r\nby the 27th. Not one Army Commander was supplied by me with the\r\ninformation I had received; in fact, not one of the senior officers at\r\nthe front knew anything of the events brewing.\r\n\r\nIt was clear that the history of the Russian Revolution had entered\r\non a new phase. What would the future bring? General Markov and I\r\nspent many hours discussing this subject. He--nervous, hot-headed and\r\nimpetuous--constantly wavered between the extremes of hope and fear.\r\nI also felt much the same; and both of us quite clearly saw and felt\r\nthe _fatal inevitability_ of a crisis. The Soviets--Bolshevists or\r\nsemi-Bolshevists, no matter which--would unfailingly bring Russia to\r\nher doom. A conflict was unavoidable. But _over there_, was there an\r\nactual chance, or was everything being done in heroic desperation?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: General Kornilov's welcome in Moscow.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nGENERAL KORNILOV'S MOVEMENT AND ITS REPERCUSSION ON THE SOUTH-WEST\r\nFRONT.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn August 27th I was thunderstruck by receiving from the Stavka\r\nnews of the dismissal of General Kornilov from the post of Supreme\r\nCommander-in-Chief.\r\n\r\nA telegram, unnumbered, and signed \"Kerensky,\" requested General\r\nKornilov to transfer the Supreme Command temporarily to General\r\nLukomsky, and, without awaiting the latter's arrival to proceed to\r\nPetrograd. Such an order was quite illegal, and not binding, as the\r\nSupreme Commander-in-Chief was in no way under the orders either of the\r\nWar Minister or of the Minister-President, certainly not of Comrade\r\nKerensky.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lukomsky, Chief-of-Staff, answered the Minister-President in\r\nTelegram No. 640, which I give below. Its contents were transmitted\r\nto us, the Commanders-in-Chief by Telegram No. 6412. which I have\r\nnot preserved. Its tenor, however, is clear from the deposition of\r\nKornilov, in which he says: \"I ordered that my decision (not to\r\nsurrender my command, and first to elucidate the situation), and that\r\nof General Lukomsky, be communicated to the Commanders-in-Chief on all\r\nfronts.\"\r\n\r\nLukomsky's telegram, No. 640, ran as follows:\r\n\r\n    All persons in touch with military affairs were perfectly aware\r\n    that, in view of the existing state of affairs, when the actual\r\n    direction of internal policy was in the hands of irresponsible\r\n    public organisations, having an enormously deleterious effect on\r\n    the Army, it would be impossible to resurrect the latter; on the\r\n    contrary, the Army, properly speaking, would cease to exist in\r\n    two or three months. Russia would then be obliged to conclude a\r\n    shameful separate peace, whose consequences to the country would\r\n    be terrible. The Government took half measures, which, changing\r\n    nothing, merely prolonged the agony, and, in saving the Revolution,\r\n    did not save Russia. At the same time, the preservation of the\r\n    benefits of the Revolution depended solely on the salvation of\r\n    Russia, for which purpose the first step must be the establishment\r\n    of a really strong Government and the reform of the home Front.\r\n    General Kornilov drew up a series of demands, the execution of\r\n    which has been delayed. In these circumstances, General Kornilov,\r\n    actuated by no motives of personal gain or aggrandisement,\r\n    and supported by the clearly-expressed will of the entire\r\n    right-thinking sections of the Army and the Civil community, who\r\n    demanded the speedy establishment of a strong Government for the\r\n    saving of their native land, and of the benefits of the Revolution,\r\n    considered more severe measures requisite which would secure the\r\n    re-establishment of order in the country.\r\n\r\n    The arrival of Savinkov and Lvov, who in your name made General\r\n    Kornilov similar proposals,[67] only brought General Kornilov to a\r\n    speedy decision. In accordance with your suggestions, he issued his\r\n    final orders, which it is now too late to repeal.\r\n\r\n    Your telegram of to-day shows that you have now altered your\r\n    previous decision, communicated in your name by Savinkov and\r\n    Lvov. Conscience demands from me, desiring only the good of the\r\n    Motherland, to declare to you absolutely that it is now impossible\r\n    to stop what was commenced with your approval; this will lead but\r\n    to civil war, the final dissolution of the Army, and a shameful\r\n    separate peace, as a consequence of which the conquests of the\r\n    Revolution will certainly not be secured to us.\r\n\r\n    In the interests of the salvation of Russia you must work with\r\n    General Kornilov, and not dismiss him. The dismissal of General\r\n    Kornilov will bring upon Russia as yet unheard-of horrors.\r\n    Personally, I decline to accept any responsibility for the Army,\r\n    even though it be for a short period, and do not consider it\r\n    possible to take over the command from General Kornilov, as this\r\n    would occasion an outburst in the Army which would cause Russia to\r\n    perish.\r\n\r\n                                                               LUKOMSKY.\r\n\r\nAll the hopes which had been entertained of the salvation of the\r\ncountry and the regeneration of the Army by peaceful means had now\r\nfailed. I had no illusions as to the consequences of such a conflict\r\nbetween General Kornilov and Kerensky, and had no hopes of a favourable\r\ntermination if only General Krymov's Corps did not manage to save the\r\nsituation. At the same time, not for one moment did I consider it\r\npossible to identify myself with the Provisional Government, which I\r\nconsidered criminally incapable, and therefore immediately despatched\r\nthe following telegram:\r\n\r\n    I am a soldier and am not accustomed to play hide and seek. On\r\n    the 16th of July, in a conference with members of the Provisional\r\n    Government, I stated that, by a series of military reforms, they\r\n    had destroyed and debauched the Army, and had trampled our battle\r\n    honours in the mud. My retention as Commander-in-Chief I explained\r\n    as being a confession by the Provisional Government of their\r\n    deadly sins before the Motherland, and of their wish to remedy the\r\n    evil they had wrought. To-day I receive information that General\r\n    Kornilov, who had put forward certain demands capable yet of saving\r\n    the country and the Army,[68] has been removed from the Supreme\r\n    Command. Seeing herein a return to the planned destruction of the\r\n    Army, having as its consequence the downfall of our country, I\r\n    feel it my duty to inform the Provisional Government that I cannot\r\n    follow their lead in this.\r\n\r\n                                                            145 DENIKIN.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously Markov sent a telegram to the Government stating his\r\nconcurrence in the views expressed by me.[69]\r\n\r\nAt the same time I ordered the Stavka to be asked in what way I could\r\nassist General Kornilov. He knew that, besides moral support, I had no\r\nactual resources at my disposal, and, therefore, thanking me for this\r\nsupport, demanded no more.\r\n\r\nI ordered copies of my telegrams to be sent to all\r\nCommanders-in-Chief, the Army Commanders of the South-Western Front,\r\nand the Inspector-General of Lines of Communication. I also ordered\r\nthe adoption of measures which would isolate the Front against the\r\npenetration of any news of events, without the knowledge of the Staff,\r\nuntil the conflict had been decided. I received similar instructions\r\nfrom the Stavka. I think it hardly necessary to state that the entire\r\nStaff warmly supported Kornilov, and all impatiently awaited news from\r\nMoghilev, still hoping for a favourable termination.\r\n\r\nAbsolutely no measures for the detention of any persons were taken:\r\nthis would have been of no use, and did not enter into our plans.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Revolutionary Democracy at the Front were in great\r\nagitation. The members of the Front Committee on this night left their\r\nquarters and lodged in private houses on the outskirts of the town.\r\nThe assistants of the Commissar were at the time away on duty, and\r\nIordansky himself in Zhitomir. An invitation from Markov to him to come\r\nto Berdichev had no result, either that night or on the 28th. Iordansky\r\nexpected a \"treacherous ambush.\"\r\n\r\nNight fell, a long, sleepless night, full of anxious waiting and\r\noppressive thoughts. Never had the future of the country seemed so\r\ndark, never had our powerlessness been so galling and oppressive. A\r\nhistoric tragedy, played out far from us, lay like a thundercloud over\r\nRussia. And we waited, waited.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget that night. Those hours still live in mental\r\npictures. Successive telegrams by direct wire: Agreement apparently\r\npossible. No hopes of a peaceful issue. Supreme Command offered to\r\nKlembovsky. Klembovsky likely to refuse. One after another copies of\r\ntelegrams to the Provisional Government from all Army Commanders of my\r\nFront, from General Oelssner and several other Senior Officers, voicing\r\ntheir adherence to the opinion expressed in my telegram. A touching\r\nfulfilment of their _civic duty_ in an atmosphere saturated with hate\r\nand suspicion. Their _soldier's oath_ they could no longer keep.\r\nFinally, the voice of despair from the Stavka. For that is the only\r\nname for the General Orders issued by Kornilov on the night of the 28th:\r\n\r\n    The telegram of the Minister-President, No. 4163[70] in its entire\r\n    first part is a downright lie: it was not I who sent Vv. N. Lvov, a\r\n    member of the State Duma, to the Provisional Government. He came to\r\n    me as a messenger from the Minister-President. My witness to this\r\n    is Alexei Aladyin, member of the State Duma.\r\n\r\n    The great provocation, placing the Motherland on the turn of fate,\r\n    is thus accomplished.\r\n\r\n    People of Russia. Our great Motherland is dying. Her end is near.\r\n\r\n    Forced to speak openly, I, General Kornilov, declare that the\r\n    Provisional Government, under pressure from the Bolshevik majority\r\n    in the Soviets, is acting in complete accordance with the plans of\r\n    the German General Staff and simultaneously with the landing of\r\n    enemy troops near Riga, is killing the Army, and convulsing the\r\n    country internally.\r\n\r\n    The solemn certainty of the doom of our country drives me in these\r\n    terrible times to call upon all Russians to save their dying\r\n    native land. All in whose breasts a Russian heart still beats, all\r\n    who believe in God, go into the Churches, pray Our Lord for the\r\n    greatest miracle, the salvation of our dear country.\r\n\r\n    I, General Kornilov, son of a peasant Cossack, announce to all and\r\n    everyone that I personally desire nothing save the preservation of\r\n    our great Russia, and vow to lead the people, through victory over\r\n    our enemies, to a Constituent Assembly, when they themselves will\r\n    settle their fate and select the form of our new national life.\r\n\r\n    I cannot betray Russia into the hands of her ancient enemy--the\r\n    German race!--and make the Russian people German slaves. And I\r\n    prefer to die honourably on the field of battle, that I may not see\r\n    the shame and degradation of our Russian land.\r\n\r\n    People of Russia, in your hands lies the life of your native land!\r\n\r\nThis order was despatched to the Army Commanders for their information.\r\nThe next day one telegram from Kerensky was received at the\r\nCommissariat, and from then all our communications with the outside\r\nworld were interrupted.[71]\r\n\r\nWell, the die was cast. A gulf had opened between the Government and\r\nthe Stavka, to bridge which was now impossible.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, the 28th, the Revolutionary institutions,\r\nseeing that absolutely nothing threatened them, exhibited a feverish\r\nactivity. Iordansky assumed the \"military authority,\" made a series of\r\nunnecessary arrests in Zhitomir among the senior officials of the Chief\r\nBoard of Supplies, and issued, under his signature and in his own name,\r\nthat of the Revolutionary organisations and that of the Commissary\r\nof the Province, an appeal, telling, in much detail and in the usual\r\nlanguage of proclamations, how General Denikin was planning \"to restore\r\nthe old régime and deprive the Russian people of Land and Freedom.\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time similar energetic work was being carried on in\r\nBerdichev under the guidance of the Frontal Committee. Meetings of all\r\nthe organisations went on incessantly, along with the \"education\" of\r\nthe typical rear units of the garrison. Here the accusation brought\r\nforward by the Committee was different: \"The counter-Revolutionary\r\nattempt of the Commander-in-Chief, General Denikin, to overthrow\r\nthe Provisional Government and restore Nicholas II. to the throne.\"\r\nProclamations to this effect were circulated in numbers among the\r\nunits, pasted on walls, and scattered from motor-cars careering through\r\nthe town. The nervous tension increased, the streets were full of\r\nnoise. The members of the Committee became more and more peremptory\r\nand exigent in their relations with Markov. Information was received\r\nof disorders which had arisen on the Lyssaya Gora (Bald Hill). The\r\nStaff sent officers thither to clear up the matter and determine the\r\npossibility of pacification. One of them--a Tchekh officer, Lieutenant\r\nKletsando--who was to have spoken with the Austrian prisoners, was\r\nattacked by Russian soldiers, one of whom he wounded slightly. This\r\ncircumstance increased the disturbance still more.\r\n\r\nFrom my window I watched the crowds of soldiers gathering on the\r\nLyssaya Gora, then forming in column, holding a prolonged meeting,\r\nwhich lasted about two hours, and apparently coming to no conclusion.\r\nFinally the column, which consisted of a troop of orderlies (formerly\r\nfield military police), a reserve _sotnia_, and sundry other armed\r\nunits, marched on the town with a number of red flags and headed by two\r\narmoured cars. On the appearance of an armoured car, which threatened\r\nto open fire, the Orenburg Cossack _sotnia_, which was on guard next\r\nthe Staff quarters and the house of the Commander-in-Chief, scattered\r\nand galloped away. We found ourselves completely in the power of the\r\nRevolutionary Democracy.\r\n\r\n\"Revolutionary sentries\" were posted round the house. The Vice-President\r\nof the Committee, Koltchinsky, led four armed \"comrades\" into the\r\nhouse for the purpose of arresting General Markov, but then began to\r\nhesitate, and confined himself to leaving in the reception-room of the\r\nChief-of-Staff two \"experts\" from the Frontal Committee to control his\r\nwork. The following wireless was sent to the Government: \"General\r\nDenikin and all his staff have been subjected to personal detention at\r\nhis Stavka. In the interests of the defence the guidance of the activity\r\nof the troops has been left in their hands, but is strictly controlled\r\nby the delegates of the Committee.\"\r\n\r\nNow began a series of long, endless, wearisome hours. They will never\r\nbe forgotten. Nor can words express the depth of the pain which now\r\nenveloped our hearts.\r\n\r\nAt 4 p.m. on the 29th Markov asked me into the reception-room,\r\nwhere Assistant-Commissary Kostitsin came with ten to fifteen armed\r\nCommittee members and read me an \"order from the Commissary of the\r\nSouth-Western Front, Iordansky,\" according to which I, Markov, and\r\nQuartermaster-General Orlov were to be subjected to preliminary arrest\r\nfor an attempt at an armed rising against the Provisional Government.\r\nAs a man of letters Iordansky seemed to have become ashamed of the\r\narguments about \"land,\" \"freedom,\" and \"Nicholas II.,\" designed\r\nexclusively for inflaming the passions of the mob.\r\n\r\nI replied that a Commander-in-Chief could be removed from his post only\r\nby the Supreme Commander-in-Chief or by the Provisional Government;\r\nthat Commissary Iordansky was acting altogether illegally, but that I\r\nwas obliged to submit to force.\r\n\r\nMotor-cars drove up, accompanied by armoured cars, and Markov and I\r\ntook our seats. Then came the long waiting for Orlov, who was handing\r\nover the files; then the tormenting curiosity of the passers-by. Then\r\nwe drove on to Lyssaya Gora. The car wandered about for a long time,\r\nhalting at one building after another, until at last we drove up to\r\nthe guard-house; we passed through a crowd of about a hundred men who\r\nwere awaiting our arrival, and were greeted with looks full of hatred\r\nand with coarse abuse. We were taken into separate cells; Kostitsin\r\nvery civilly offered to send me any of my things I might require, but I\r\nbrusquely declined any services from him; the door was slammed to, the\r\nkey turned noisily in the lock, and I was alone.\r\n\r\nIn a few days the Stavka was liquidated. Kornilov, Lukomsky,\r\nRomanovsky, and others were taken off to the Bykhov Prison.\r\n\r\nThe Revolutionary Democracy was celebrating its victory.\r\n\r\nYet at that very time the Government was opening wide the doors of the\r\nprisons in Petrograd and liberating many influential Bolsheviks--to\r\nenable them to continue, publicly and openly, their work of destroying\r\nthe Russian Empire.\r\n\r\nOn September 1 the Provisional Government arrested General Kornilov;\r\non September 4 the Provisional Government liberated Bronstein Trotsky.\r\nThese two dates should be memorable for Russia.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCell No. 1. The floor is some seven feet square. The window is closed\r\nwith an iron grating. The door has a small peep-hole in it. The cell\r\nis furnished with a sleeping bench, a table, and a stool. The air is\r\nclose--an evil-smelling place lies next door. On the other side is cell\r\nNo. 2, with Markov in it; he walks up and down with large, nervous\r\nstrides. Somehow or other I still remember that he makes three steps\r\nalong his cell, while I manage, on a curve, to make five. The prison\r\nis full of vague sounds. The strained ear begins to distinguish them,\r\nand gradually to make out the course of prison life, and even its\r\nmoods. The guards--I guess them to be soldiers of the prison guard\r\ncompany--are rough and revengeful men.\r\n\r\nIt is early morning. Someone's voice is booming. Whence? Outside of\r\nthe window, clinging to the grating, hang two soldiers. They look at\r\nme with cruel, savage eyes, and hysterically utter terrible curses.\r\nThey throw in something abominable through the open window. There is no\r\nescape from their gaze. I turn to the door--there another pair of eyes,\r\nfull of hatred, peers through the peep-hole; thence choice abuse pours\r\nin also. I lie down on the sleeping-bench and cover my head with my\r\ncloak. I lie for hours. The whole day, one after another, the \"public\r\naccusers\" replace each other at the window and at the door--the guards\r\nallow all to come freely. And into the narrow, close kennel pours,\r\nin an unceasing torrent, a foul stream of words, shouts, and curses,\r\nborn of immense ignorance, blind hate, and bottomless coarseness.\r\nOne's whole soul seems to be drenched with that abuse, and there is no\r\ndeliverance, no escape from this moral torture chamber.\r\n\r\nWhat is it all about? \"Wanted to open the Front\" ... \"sold himself\r\nto the Germans\"--the sum, too, was mentioned--\"for twenty thousand\r\nroubles\" ... \"wanted to deprive us of land and freedom.\" This\r\nwas not their own, this was borrowed from the Committee. But\r\nCommander-in-Chief, General, gentleman--this, indeed, was their own!\r\n\"You have drunk our blood, ordered us about, kept us stewing in prison;\r\nnow we are free and you can sit behind the bars yourself. You pampered\r\nyourself, drove about in motor-cars; now you can try what lying on a\r\nwooden bench is, you ----. You have not much time left. We shan't wait\r\ntill you run away--we will strangle you with our own hands.\" These\r\nwarriors of the rear scarcely knew me at all. But all that had been\r\ngathering for years, for centuries, in their exasperated hearts against\r\nthe power they did not love, against the inequality of classes, because\r\nof personal grievances and of their shattered lives--for which someone\r\nor other was to blame--all this now came to the surface in the form\r\nof unmitigated cruelty. And the higher the standing of him who was\r\nreckoned the enemy of the people, and the deeper his fall, the more\r\nviolent was the hostility of the mob and the greater the satisfaction\r\nof seeing him in its hands. Meanwhile, behind the wings of the popular\r\nstage stood the managers, who inflamed both the wrath and the delight\r\nof the populace; who did not believe in the villainy of the actors,\r\nbut permitted them even to perish for the sake of greater realism in\r\nthe performance and to the greater glory of their sectarian dogmatism.\r\nThese motives of party policy, however, were called \"tactical\r\nconsiderations.\"\r\n\r\nI lay, covered head and all by my cloak and, under a shower of oaths,\r\ntried to see things clearly:\r\n\r\n\"What have I done to deserve this?\"\r\n\r\nI went through the stages of my life.... My father was a stern soldier\r\nwith a most kindly heart. Up to thirty years of age he had been a\r\npeasant serf and was drafted into the Army, where, after twenty-two\r\nyears of hard service in the ranks, under the severe discipline of the\r\ntimes of Nicholas I, he was promoted to the rank of 2nd Lieutenant.\r\nHe retired with the rank of Major. My childhood was hard and joyless,\r\namidst the poverty of a pension of 45 roubles a month. Then my father\r\ndied. Life became still harder. My mother's pension was 25 roubles\r\na month. My youth was passed in study and in working for my daily\r\nbread. I became a volunteer in the Army, messing in barracks with the\r\nprivates. Then came my officer's commission, then the Staff College.\r\nThe unfairness of my promotion, my complaint to the Emperor against\r\nthe all-powerful Minister of War, and my return to the 2nd Artillery\r\nBrigade. My conflict with a moribund group of old adherents of serfdom;\r\ntheir accusation of demagogy. The General Staff. My practice command\r\nof a company in the 183rd Pultussk Regiment. Here I put an end to the\r\nsystem of striking the soldiers and made an unsuccessful experiment\r\nin \"conscious discipline.\" Yes, Mr. Kerensky, I did this also in my\r\nyounger days. I privately abolished disciplinary punishment--\"watch\r\none another, restrain the weak-spirited--after all, you are decent\r\nmen--show that you can do your duty without the stick.\" I finished my\r\ncommand: during the year the behaviour of the company had not been\r\nabove the average, it drilled poorly and lazily. After my departure the\r\nold Sergeant-Major, Stsepoura, gathered the company together, raised\r\nhis fist significantly in the air and said distinctly, separating his\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\"Now it is not Captain Denikin whom you will have. Do you understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Sergeant-Major.\"\r\n\r\nIt was said, afterwards, that the company soon showed improvement.\r\n\r\nThen came the war in Manchuria; active service; hopes for the\r\nregeneration of the Army. Then an open struggle, in a stifled Press,\r\nwith the higher command of the Army, against stagnation, ignorance,\r\nprivileges and licence--a struggle for the welfare of the officer and\r\nthe soldier. The times were stern--all my service, all my military\r\ncareer was at stake. Then came my command of a regiment, constant\r\ncare for the improvement of the condition of the soldiers, after my\r\nPultussk experience--strict service demands, but also respect for the\r\nhuman dignity of the soldier. At that time we seemed to understand\r\none another and were not strangers. Then came war again, the \"Iron\"\r\nDivision, nearer relations with the rifleman and work with him in\r\ncommon. The staff was always near the positions, so as to share mud,\r\nwant of space, and dangers with the men. Then a long, laborious path,\r\nfull of glorious battles, in which a common life, common sufferings\r\nand common fame brought us still closer together, and created a mutual\r\nfaith and a touching proximity.\r\n\r\nNo, I have never been an enemy to the soldier.\r\n\r\nI threw off my cloak, and, jumping from the wooden bed, went up to the\r\nwindow, where the figure of a soldier clung to the grating, belching\r\nforth curses.\r\n\r\n\"You lie, soldier! It is not your own words that you are speaking. If\r\nyou are not a coward, hiding in the rear, if you have been in action,\r\nyou have seen how your officers could die. You have seen that they....\"\r\n\r\nHis hands loosened their grip and the figure disappeared. I think it\r\nwas simply because of my stern address, which, despite the impotence of\r\na prisoner, produced its usual effect.\r\n\r\nFresh faces appeared at the window and at the peep-hole in the door.\r\n\r\nIt was not always, however, that we met with insolence alone.\r\nSometimes, through the assumed rudeness of our gaolers we could see\r\na feeling of awkwardness, confusion and even commiseration. But of\r\nthese feelings they were ashamed. On the first cold night, when we\r\nhad none of our things, a guard brought Markov, who had forgotten\r\nhis overcoat, a soldier's overcoat, but half an hour later--whether\r\nhe had grown ashamed of his good action, or whether his comrades had\r\nshamed him--he took it back. In Markov's cursory notes we find: \"We\r\nare looked after by two Austrian prisoners.... Besides them, we have\r\nas our caterer a soldier, formerly of the Finland Rifles (a Russian),\r\na very kind and thoughtful man. During our first days he, too, had a\r\nhard time of it--his comrades gave him no peace; now, however, matters\r\nare all right; they have quieted down. His care for our food is simply\r\ntouching, while the news he brings is delightful in its simplicity.\r\nYesterday, he told me that he would miss us when we are taken away.\r\n\r\n\"I soothed him by saying that our places would soon be filled by new\r\ngenerals--that all had not yet been destroyed.\"\r\n\r\nMy heart is heavy. My feelings seem to be split in two: I hate and\r\ndespise the savage, cruel, senseless mob, but still I feel the old pity\r\nfor the soldier: an ignorant, illiterate man, who has been led astray,\r\nand is capable both of abominable crimes and of lofty sacrifices!\r\n\r\nSoon the duty of guarding us was given to the cadets of the 2nd\r\nZhitomir School of 2nd Lieutenants. Our condition became much easier\r\nfrom the moral point of view. They not only watched over the prisoners,\r\nbut also guarded them from the mob. And the mob, more than once, on\r\nvarious occasions, gathered near the guard-room and roared wildly,\r\nthreatening to lynch us. In such cases the company on guard gathered\r\nhastily in a house nearly opposite us and the cadets on guard made\r\nready their machine-guns. I recall that, calmly and clearly realising\r\nmy danger, when the mob was especially stormy, I planned out my method\r\nof self-defence: a heavy water-bottle stood upon my table; with it\r\nI might hit the first man to break into my cell; his blood would\r\ninfuriate and intoxicate the \"comrades,\" and they would kill me at\r\nonce, without torturing me....\r\n\r\nWith the exception, however, of such unpleasant moments, our life in\r\nprison went on in a measured, methodical way; it was quiet and restful;\r\nafter the strain of our campaigning, and in comparison with the moral\r\nsuffering we had undergone, the physical inconveniences of the prison\r\nrégime were mere trifles. Our life was varied by little incidents.\r\nSometimes a Bolshevist cadet standing at the door would tell the sentry\r\nloudly, so that his words might be heard in the cell, that at their\r\nlast meeting the comrades of Lyssaya Gora, having lost all patience,\r\nhad finally decided to lynch us, and added that this was what we\r\ndeserved. Another time, Markov, passing along the corridor, saw a cadet\r\nsentry leaning on his rifle, with the tears streaming from his eyes--he\r\nfelt sorry for us. What a strange, unusual exhibition of sentiment in\r\nour savage days.\r\n\r\nFor a fortnight I did not leave my cell for exercise, not wishing to be\r\nan object of curiosity for the \"comrades,\" who surrounded the square\r\nbefore the guard-room and examined the arrested generals as if they\r\nwere beasts in a menagerie. I had no communication with my neighbours,\r\nbut much time for meditation and thought.\r\n\r\nAnd every day as I open my window I hear from the house opposite a\r\nhigh, tenor voice--whether of friend or foe I know not--singing:\r\n\r\n\"This is the last day that I ramble with you, my friends.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nIN BERDICHEV GAOL--THE TRANSFER OF THE \"BERDICHEV GROUP\" OF PRISONERS\r\nTO BYKHOV.\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides Markov and me, whose share in events has been depicted in the\r\npreceding chapters, the following were cast into prison:\r\n\r\n3. General Erdeli, Commander of the Special Army.\r\n\r\n4. Lieutenant-General Varnovsky, Commander of the 1st Army.\r\n\r\n5. Lieutenant-General Selivatchev, Commander of the 7th Army.\r\n\r\n6. Lieutenant-General Eisner, Chief of Supplies to the South-Western\r\nFront.\r\n\r\nThe guilt of these men lay in their expression of solidarity with my\r\ntelegram No. 145, and of the last, moreover, in his fulfilment of my\r\norders for the isolation of the frontal region with respect to Kiev and\r\nZhitomir.\r\n\r\n7 and 8. General Eisner's assistants--General Parsky and General\r\nSergievsky--men who had absolutely no connection with events.\r\n\r\n9. Major-General Orlov, Quartermaster-General of the Staff of the\r\nFront--a wounded man with a withered arm, timid, and merely carrying\r\nout the orders of the Chief-of-Staff.\r\n\r\n10. Lieutenant Kletsando, of the Tchekh troops, who had wounded a\r\nsoldier of Lyssaya Gora on August 28th.\r\n\r\n11. Captain Prince Krapotkin, a man over sixty years of age, a\r\nVolunteer, and the Commandant of the Commander-in-Chief's train. He was\r\nnot initiated into events at all.\r\n\r\nGeneral Selivatchev, General Parsky and General Sergievsky were soon\r\nreleased. Prince Krapotkin was informed on September 6th that his\r\nactions had not been criminal, but was set free only on September\r\n23rd, when it appeared that we were not to be tried at Berdichev. For\r\na charge of rebellion to hold good against us an association of eight\r\nmen at the very least had to be discovered. Our antagonists were much\r\ninterested in this figure, being desirous of observing the rules of\r\ndecorum.... There was another prisoner, however, kept in reserve and\r\nseparate from us, at the Commandant's office, and even afterwards\r\ntransferred to Bykhov--a military official named Boudilovitch--a youth\r\nweak in body, but strong in spirit, who on one occasion dared to tell a\r\nwrathful mob that it was not worth the little finger of those whom it\r\nwas maltreating.[72] No other crime was imputed to him.\r\n\r\nOn the second or third day of my imprisonment I read in a newspaper,\r\nwhich had accidentally or purposely found its way into my cell, an\r\norder from the Provisional Government to the Senate, dated August 29th,\r\nwhich ran as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Lieutenant-General Denikin, Commander-in-Chief of the Armies of the\r\nSouth-Western Front, to be removed from the post of Commander-in-Chief\r\nand brought to trial for rebellion.--Signed: Minister-President A.\r\nKerensky and B. Savinkov--in charge of the War Ministry.\"\r\n\r\nOn the same date similar orders were issued concerning Generals\r\nKornilov, Lukomsky, Markov and Kisliakov. Later an order was issued for\r\nthe removal of General Romanovsky.\r\n\r\nOn the second or the third day of my arrest the guard-room was visited,\r\nfor our examination, by a Committee of Investigation, under the\r\nsuperintendence of the Chief Field Prosecutor of the Front, General\r\nBatog, and under the presidency of Assistant-Commissar Kostitsin,\r\nconsisting of:\r\n\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Shestoperov, in charge of the Juridical Section\r\nof the Commissariat; Lieutenant-Colonel Frank, of the Kiev Military\r\nCourt; 2nd Lieut. Oudaltsov and Junior Sergeant of Artillery Levenberg,\r\nmembers of the Committee of the Front.\r\n\r\nMy evidence, in view of the facts of the case, was very short, and\r\nconsisted of the following statements: (1) None of the persons\r\narrested with me had taken part in any active proceedings against the\r\nGovernment; (2) all orders given to and through the Staff during my\r\nlast days, in connection with General Kornilov's venture, proceeded\r\nfrom me; (3) I considered, and still consider, that the activity of the\r\nProvisional Government is criminal and ruinous for Russia, but that\r\nnevertheless I had not instituted a rebellion against it, but having\r\nsent my telegram No. 145, I had left it to the Provisional Government\r\nto take such action towards me as it might see fit.\r\n\r\nLater the Chief Military Prosecutor, Shablovsky, having acquainted\r\nhimself with the material of the investigation and with the\r\ncircumstances which had arisen around it in Berdichev, was horrified at\r\nthe \"uncautious formulation\" of my evidence.\r\n\r\nBy September 1st Iordansky was already reporting to the War Ministry\r\nthat the Committee of Investigation had discovered documents\r\nestablishing the existence of a conspiracy which had long been\r\npreparing.... At the same time, Iordansky, man of letters, inquired of\r\nthe Government whether, in the matter of the direction of the cases of\r\nthe Generals arrested, he could act within the limits of the law, _in\r\nconformity with local circumstances_, or whether he was bound to be\r\nguided by any _political considerations_ of the Central Authority. In\r\nreply he was informed that he must act reckoning with the law alone and\r\n... _taking into consideration local circumstances_.[73]\r\n\r\nIn view of this explanation, Iordansky decided to commit us for trial\r\nby a Revolutionary Court-Martial, to which end a Court was formed of\r\nmembers of one of the Divisions formerly subordinated to me at the\r\nFront, while Captain Pavlov, member of the Executive Committee of the\r\nSouth-Western Front, was marked down for public prosecutor.\r\n\r\nThus the interests of competency, impartiality and fair play were\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nIordansky was so anxious to obtain a speedy verdict for myself\r\nand for the Generals imprisoned with me that on September 3rd he\r\nproposed that the Commission, without waiting for the elucidation\r\nof the circumstances, should present the cases to the Revolutionary\r\nCourt-Martial in groups, as the guilt of one or other of the accused\r\nwas established.\r\n\r\nWe were much depressed by our complete ignorance of what was taking\r\nplace in the outer world.\r\n\r\nOn rare occasions Kostitsin acquainted us with the more important\r\ncurrent events, but in the Commissar's comments on the events only\r\ndepressed us still more. It was clear, however, that the Government was\r\nbreaking up altogether, that Bolshevism was raising its head higher and\r\nhigher, and that the country must inevitably perish.\r\n\r\nAbout September 8th or 10th, when the investigation was over, our\r\nprison surroundings underwent, to some extent, a change. Newspapers\r\nbegan to appear in our cells almost daily; at first secretly,\r\nafterwards, from September 22nd, officially. At the same time, after\r\nthe relief of one of the Companies of Guards, we decided to try an\r\nexperiment: during our exercise in the corridor I approached Markov\r\nand started talking with him; the sentries did not interfere. From\r\nthat time we began talking with one another every day; sometimes the\r\nsentries demanded that we should stop, and then we were silent at once,\r\nbut more frequently they did not interfere. In the second half of\r\nSeptember visitors also were allowed; the curiosity of the \"comrades\"\r\nof Lyssaya Gora was now apparently satisfied; fewer of them gathered\r\nabout the square, and I used to go out to walk every day, was able\r\nto see all the prisoners and exchange a few words with them now and\r\nagain. Now, at least, we knew what was doing in the world, while the\r\npossibility of meeting one another removed the depression caused by\r\nisolation.\r\n\r\nFrom the papers we learned that the investigation of the Kornilov case\r\nwas committed to the Supreme Investigation Committee, presided over by\r\nthe Chief Military and Naval Prosecutor, Shablovsky.[74]\r\n\r\nAbout September 9th, in the evening, a great noise and the furious\r\nshouts of a large crowd were heard near the prison. In a little while\r\nfour strangers entered my cell--confused and much agitated by something\r\nor other. They said they were the President and members of the Supreme\r\nCommittee of Investigation for the Kornilov case.[75]\r\n\r\nShablovsky, in a still somewhat broken voice, began to explain that\r\nthe purpose of their arrival was to take us off to Bykhov, and that,\r\njudging by the temper which had developed in Berdichev, and by the\r\nfury of the mob which now surrounded the prison, they could see that\r\nthere were no guarantees for justice here, but only savage revenge.\r\nHe added that the Committee had no doubt as to the inadmissibility\r\nof any segregation of our cases, and as to the necessity of a common\r\ntrial for all the participators in the Kornilov venture, but that the\r\nCommissariat and the Committees were using all means against this. The\r\nCommittee, therefore, asked me whether I would not wish to supplement\r\nmy evidence by any facts which might yet more clearly establish\r\nthe connection between our case and Kornilov's. In view of the\r\nimpossibility of holding the examination amidst the roar of the crowd\r\nwhich had gathered, they decided to postpone it to the following day.\r\n\r\nThe Committee departed; soon after the crowd dispersed.\r\n\r\nWhat more could I tell them? Only, perhaps, something of the advice\r\nwhich Kornilov had given me at Moghilev, and through a messenger. But\r\nthis was done as a matter of exceptional confidence on the part of the\r\nSupreme Commander-in-Chief, which I could in no case permit myself to\r\nbreak. Therefore, the few details which I added next day to my original\r\nevidence did not console the commission and did not, apparently,\r\nsatisfy the volunteer, a member of the Committee of the Front, who was\r\npresent at the examination.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we waited with impatience for our liberation from the\r\nBerdichev chamber of torture. But our hopes were clouded more and more.\r\nThe newspaper of the Committee of the Front methodically fomented the\r\npassions of the garrison; it was reported that at all the meetings of\r\nall the Committees resolutions were passed against letting us out of\r\nBerdichev; the Committee members were agitating mightily among the rear\r\nunits of the garrison, and meetings were held which passed off in a\r\nspirit of great exaltation.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the Shablovsky Commission was not attained. As it turned out\r\nin the beginning of September, to Shablovsky's demand that a separate\r\ntrial of the \"Berdichev group\" should not be allowed, Iordansky replied\r\nthat \"to say nothing of the transfer of the generals to any place\r\nwhatsoever, even the least postponement of their trial would threaten\r\nRussia with incalculable calamities--complications at the front, and a\r\nnew civil war in the rear,\" and that both on political and on tactical\r\ngrounds it was necessary to have us tried in Berdichev, in the shortest\r\npossible time, and by Revolutionary Court-Martial.[76]\r\n\r\nThe Committee of the Front and the Kiev Soviet of Workmen's and\r\nSoldiers' Delegates would not agree to our transfer, despite all\r\nthe arguments and persuasions brought forward at their meeting by\r\nShablovsky and the members of his Commission. On the way back, at\r\nMoghilev, a consultation took place on this question between Kerensky,\r\nShablovsky, Iordansky and Batog. All, excepting Shablovsky, came to the\r\naltogether unequivocal conclusion that the front was shaken, that the\r\nsoldiery was restless and demanding a victim, and that it was necessary\r\nto enable the tense atmosphere to discharge itself, even at the cost\r\nof injustice.... Shablovsky rose and declared that he would not permit\r\nsuch a cynical attitude toward law and justice.\r\n\r\nI remember that this tale perplexed me. It is not worth while disputing\r\nabout points of view. But if the Minister-President is convinced that\r\nin the matter of protecting the State it is admissible to let oneself\r\nbe guided by expediency, in what way, then, was Kornilov to blame?\r\n\r\nOn September 14th a debate took place in Petrograd, in the last \"court\r\nof appeal\"--in the military section of the Executive Committee of the\r\nCouncil of Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates--between Shablovsky and\r\nthe representative of the Committee of the South-Western Front, fully\r\nsupported by Iordansky. The last two declared that if the Revolutionary\r\nCourt-Martial was not held on the spot, in Berdichev, in the course\r\nof the next five days the lynching of the prisoners was to be feared.\r\nHowever, the Central Committee agreed with Shablovsky's arguments, and\r\nsent its resolution to that effect to Berdichev.\r\n\r\nSo an organised lynching was prevented. But the Revolutionary\r\ninstitutions of Berdichev had at their service another method for\r\nliquidating the \"Berdichev group,\" an easy and irresponsible one--the\r\nmethod of popular wrath....\r\n\r\nA rumour spread that we were to be taken away on the 23rd, then it was\r\nstated that our departure would take place on the 27th at 5 p.m. from\r\nthe passenger station.\r\n\r\nTo take the prisoners away without making the fact public was in no\r\nway difficult: in a motor-car, on foot in a column of cadets, or,\r\nagain, in a railway carriage--a narrow gauge-line came close up to the\r\nguard-house and joined on to the broad gauge-line outside the town and\r\nthe railway station.[77] But such a method of transferring us did not\r\nagree with the intentions of the Commissariat and the Committees.\r\n\r\nGeneral Doukhonin inquired from the Stavka, of the Staff of the Front,\r\nwhether there were any reliable units in Berdichev, and offered to send\r\na detachment to assist in our move. The Staff of the Front declined\r\nassistance. The Commander-in-Chief, General Volodchenko, had left on\r\nthe eve, the 26th, for the Front....\r\n\r\nMuch talk and an unhealthy atmosphere of expectation and curiosity were\r\nbeing artificially created around this question....\r\n\r\nKerensky sent a telegram to the Commissariat: \"I am sure of the\r\nprudence of the garrison, which may elect, from among its numbers, two\r\nrepresentatives to accompany.\"\r\n\r\nIn the morning the Commissariat began visiting all the units in the\r\ngarrison, to obtain their consent to our transfer.\r\n\r\nThe Committee had appointed a meeting of the whole garrison for 2 p.m.,\r\n_i.e._, three hours before our departure, and in the field, moreover,\r\nimmediately beside our prison. This mass meeting did indeed take place;\r\nat it the representatives of the Commissariat and of the Committee of\r\nthe Front announced the orders for our transfer to Bykhov, thoughtfully\r\nannounced the hour of our departure and appealed to the garrison ...\r\nto be prudent; the meeting continued for a long time and, of course,\r\ndid not disperse. By 5 o'clock an excited crowd of thousands of men had\r\nsurrounded the guard-room, and its dull murmur made its way into the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nAmong the officers of the Cadet Battalion of the 2nd Zhitomir School\r\nof 2nd Lieutenants, which was on guard this day, was Captain Betling,\r\nwounded in many battles, who before the War had served in the 17th\r\nArchangelogorod Infantry Regiment, which I commanded.[78] Betling asked\r\nthe superior officer of the School to replace by his half-company the\r\ndetachment appointed to accompany the prisoners to the railway station.\r\nWe all dressed and came out into the corridor. We waited. An hour, two\r\nhours passed....\r\n\r\nThe meeting continued. Numerous speakers called for an immediate\r\nlynching.... The soldier who had been wounded by Lieutenant Kletsando\r\nwas shouting hysterically and demanding his head.... Standing in the\r\nporch of the guard-room, Assistant Commissaries Kostitsin and Grigoriev\r\nwere trying persuasion with the mob. That dear Betling, too, spoke\r\nseveral times, hotly and passionately. We could not hear his words.\r\n\r\nAt last, pale and agitated, Betling and Kostitsin came up to me.\r\n\r\n\"How will you decide? The crowd has promised not to touch anyone, only\r\nit demands that you should be taken to the station on foot. But we\r\ncannot answer for anything.\"\r\n\r\nI replied:\r\n\r\n\"Let us go.\"\r\n\r\nI took off my cap and crossed myself:\r\n\r\n\"Lord, bless us!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe crowd raged. We, the seven of us, surrounded by a group of cadets,\r\nheaded by Betling, who marched by my side with drawn sword, entered\r\nthe narrow passage through this living human sea, which pressed on us\r\nfrom all sides. In front were Kostitsin and the delegates (twelve to\r\nfifteen) chosen by the garrison to escort us. Night was coming on, and\r\nin its eerie gloom, with the rays of the searchlight on the armoured\r\ncar cutting through it now and then, moved the raving mob, growing and\r\nrolling on like a flaming avalanche. The air was full of a deafening\r\nroar, hysterical shouts, and mephitic curses. At times they were\r\ncovered by Betling's loud, anxious voice:\r\n\r\n\"Comrades, you have given your word!... Comrades, you have given your\r\nword!...\"\r\n\r\nThe cadets, those splendid youths, crushed together on all sides, push\r\naside with their bodies the pressing crowd, which disorders their thin\r\nranks. Passing the pools left by yesterday's rain, the soldiers fill\r\ntheir hands with mud and pelt us with it. Our faces, eyes, ears, are\r\ncovered with its fetid, viscid slime. Stones come flying at us. Poor,\r\ncrippled General Orlov has his face severely bruised; Erdeli and I, as\r\nwell, were struck--in the back and on the head.\r\n\r\nOn our way we exchanged monosyllabic remarks. I turned to Markov:\r\n\r\n\"What, my dear Professor, is this the end?\"\r\n\r\n\"Apparently....\"\r\n\r\nThe mob would not let us come up to the station by the straight path.\r\nWe were taken by a roundabout way, some three miles altogether, through\r\nthe main streets of the town. The crowd is growing. The balconies of\r\nthe Berdichev houses are full of curious spectators; the women wave\r\ntheir handkerchiefs. Gay, guttural voices come from above:\r\n\r\n\"Long live freedom!\"\r\n\r\nThe railway station is flooded with light. There we find a new,\r\nvast crowd of several thousand people. And all this has merged in\r\nthe general sea which rages and roars. With enormous difficulty we\r\nare brought through it under a hail of curses and of glances full\r\nof hatred. The railway carriage. An officer--Elsner's son--sobbing\r\nhysterically and addressing impotent threats to the mob, and his\r\nsoldier servant, lovingly soothing him, as he takes away his revolver;\r\ntwo women, dumb with horror--Kletsando's wife and sister, who had\r\nthought to see him off....\r\n\r\nWe wait for an hour, for another. The train is not allowed to leave--a\r\nprisoner's car is demanded. There were none at the station. The mob\r\nthreatens to do for the Commissaries. Kostitsin is slightly buffeted.\r\nA goods car is brought, all defiled with horse-dung--what a trifle! We\r\nenter it without the assistance of a platform; poor Orlov is lifted in\r\nwith difficulty; hundreds of hands are stretched towards us through\r\nthe firm and steady ranks of the cadets.... It is already 10 p.m. The\r\nengine gives a jerk. The crowd booms out still louder. Two shots are\r\nheard. The train starts.\r\n\r\nThe noise dies away, the lights grow dimmer. Farewell Berdichev!\r\n\r\nKerensky shed a tear of delight over the self-abnegation of \"our\r\nsaviours\"--as he called--not the cadets, but the Commissaries and the\r\nCommittee members.\r\n\r\n\"What irony of fate! General Denikin, arrested as Kornilov's\r\naccomplice, was saved from the rage of the frenzied soldiers by the\r\nmembers of the Executive Committee of the South-Western Front and by\r\nthe Commissaries of the Provisional Government.\"\r\n\r\n\"I remember with what agitation I and the never-to-be-forgotten\r\nDoukhonin read the account of how a handful of these brave men escorted\r\nthe arrested generals through a crowd of thousands of soldiers who were\r\nthirsting for their blood....\"[79] Why slander the dead? Certainly,\r\nDoukhonin was no less anxious for the fate of the prisoners than for\r\n... the fate of their revolutionary escort....\r\n\r\nThat Roman citizen, Pontius Pilate, smiled mockingly through the gloom\r\nof the ages....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nSOME CONCLUSIONS AS TO THE FIRST PERIOD OF THE REVOLUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory will not soon give us a picture of the Revolution in a broad,\r\nimpartial light. Those prospects which are now opening out to our view\r\nare sufficient only to enable us to grasp certain particular phenomena\r\nin it and, perhaps, to reject the prejudices and misconceptions which\r\nhave sprung up around them.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution was inevitable. It is called a Revolution of the whole\r\npeople. This is correct only in so far as the Revolution was the Result\r\nof the discontent of literally all classes of the population with the\r\nold power. But upon the question of its achievements opinions were\r\ndivided, and deep breaches were bound to appear between classes on the\r\nvery next day after the downfall of the old Power.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution was many-faced. For the peasants--the ownership of\r\nthe land; for the workmen--the ownership of profits; for the Liberal\r\nBourgeoisie--changed political conditions of life in the land and\r\nmoderate social reforms; for the Revolutionary Democracy--power and the\r\nmaximum of social achievement; for the Army--absence of authority and\r\nthe cessation of the War.\r\n\r\nWith the downfall of the power of the Czar, there was left in the\r\ncountry, until the summoning of a Constituent Assembly, no lawful\r\npower, no power that had a juridical basis. This is perfectly natural\r\nand follows from the very nature of a Revolution. But whether through\r\ngenuine misconception or deliberately perverting the truth, men have\r\nfabricated theories, known to be false, about the \"general popular\r\norigin of the Provisional Government\" or about the \"full powers of the\r\nSoviet of Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates,\" as an organ supposed\r\nto represent the \"whole of the Russian Democracy.\" What an elastic\r\nconscience one must have, if, while professing democratic principles\r\nand protesting violently against the slightest deviation from orthodox\r\nconditions of the lawfulness of elections, one can still ascribe full\r\npowers, as the organ of democracy, to the Petrograd Soviet or to the\r\nCongress of Soviets, the election of which is of an extraordinary\r\nsimplified and one-sided character. It was not without reason that\r\nfor a long time the Petrograd Soviet hesitated to publish lists of\r\nits members. As to the supreme Power, to say nothing of its \"popular\r\norigin\" from a \"private meeting of the State Duma,\" the technique of\r\nits construction was so imperfect that repeated crises might have put\r\nan end to its very existence and to every trace of its continuity.\r\nFinally, a really \"popular\" Government could not have remained\r\nisolated, left by all to the will of a group of usurpers of authority.\r\nThat same Government which, in the days of March, so easily obtained\r\ngeneral recognition. Recognition, yes, but not practical support.\r\n\r\nAfter March 3rd, and up to the Constituent Assembly, _every_\r\nsupreme authority bore the marks of self-assumed power, and _no_\r\npower could satisfy all classes of the population, in view of the\r\nirreconciliableness of their interests and the intemperance of their\r\ndesires.\r\n\r\nNeither of the ruling powers (the Provisional Government and the\r\nSoviet) enjoyed the due support of the _majority_. For this majority\r\n(80 per cent.) said, through its representatives in the Constituent\r\nAssembly of 1918: \"We peasants make no difference between parties;\r\nparties fight for power, while our peasant business is the land alone.\"\r\nBut even if, forestalling the will of the Constituent Assembly, the\r\nProvisional Government had satisfied these desires of the majority\r\nin full, it could not have reckoned on this majority's immediate\r\nsubmission to the general interests of the State, nor on its _active_\r\nsupport: engaged in the redistribution of the land, which also had\r\na strong attraction for the elements at the Front, the peasantry\r\nwould scarcely have given the State, voluntarily, the forces and\r\nthe means for putting it in order, _i.e._ plenty of corn and plenty\r\nof soldiers--brave, faithful and obedient to the law. Even then the\r\nGovernment would have been faced with insoluble problems: an Army which\r\ndid not fight, an unproductive industry, a transport system which was\r\nbeing broken down and ... the civil war of parties.\r\n\r\nLet us, therefore, set aside the popular and democratic origin of\r\nthe Provisional authority. Let it be self-assumed, as it has been in\r\nthe history of all revolutions and of all peoples. But the very fact\r\nof the wide recognition of the Provisional Government gave it a vast\r\nadvantage over all the other forces which disputed its authority.\r\nIt was necessary, however, that this power should become so strong,\r\nso absolute in its nature, so autocratic, as, having crushed all\r\nopposition by force, perhaps by arms, to have led the country to a\r\nConstituent Assembly, elected in surroundings which did not admit of\r\nthe falsification of the popular vote, and to have protected this\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\nWe are apt to abuse the words \"elemental force,\" as an excuse for many\r\nphenomena of the Revolution. That \"molten element\" which swept Kerensky\r\naway with the greatest ease, has it not fallen into the iron grip of\r\nLenin-Bronstein and, for more than three years, been unable to escape\r\nfrom Bolshevist duress?\r\n\r\nIf such a power, harsh, but inspired by reason and by a true desire for\r\npopular rule, had assumed authority and, having crushed the _licence_\r\ninto which _freedom_ had been transmuted, had led this authority to\r\na Constituent Assembly, the Russian people would have blessed, not\r\ncondemned it. In such a position will every provisional authority find\r\nitself which accepts the heritage of Bolshevism; and Russia will judge\r\nit, not by the juridical marks of its origin, but by its works.\r\n\r\nWhy is the overthrow of the incompetent authority of the old Government\r\nto be an achievement, to the memory of which the Provisional Government\r\nproposed erecting a monument in the Capital, while the attempt to\r\noverthrow the incompetent authority of Kerensky, made by Kornilov,\r\nafter exhausting all lawful means and after provocation on the part of\r\nthe Minister-President, is to be counted rebellion?\r\n\r\nBut the need for a powerful authority is far from being exhausted by\r\nthe period preceding the Constituent Assembly. Did not the Assembly\r\nof 1918 call in vain on the country, not for submission, but simply\r\nfor protection from physical outrage on the part of the turbulent\r\nsailor horde? Yet not a hand was raised in its defence. Let us grant\r\nthat _that_ Assembly, born in an atmosphere of mutiny and violence,\r\ndid not express the will of the Russian people and that the future\r\nAssembly will reflect that will more perfectly. I think, however,\r\nthat even those who have the most exalted faith in the infallibility\r\nof the democratic principle do not close their eyes to the unbounded\r\npossibilities of the future which will be the heritage of such a\r\nphysical and psychological transformation in the people as is unknown\r\nto history and has never yet been investigated by anyone.\r\n\r\nWho knows whether it may not be necessary to confirm the democratic\r\nprinciple, the authority itself of the Constituent Assembly, and its\r\ncommands, by iron and fresh bloodshed....\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, the _outward_ recognition of the Provisional\r\nGovernment took place. It would be difficult and useless to separate,\r\nin the work of the Government, that which proceeded from its free will\r\nand sincere convictions from what bears the stamp of the forcible\r\ninfluence of the Soviet. If Tzeretelli was entitled to declare that\r\n\"there has never yet been a case when, in important questions, the\r\nProvisional Government has not been ready to come to an agreement,\" so\r\nhave we the right to identify their work and their responsibility.\r\n\r\nAll this activity, _volens nolens_, bore the character of destruction,\r\nnot creation. The Government repealed, abolished, disbanded,\r\npermitted.... In this lay the centre of gravity of its work. I picture\r\nto myself the Russia of that period as a very old house, in need of\r\ncapital reconstruction. In the absence of means and while waiting for\r\nthe building season (the Constituent Assembly), the builders began\r\nextracting the decayed girders, some of which they did not replace at\r\nall, others they replaced with light, temporary props, and others again\r\nthey reinforced with new baulks without fastenings--the latter means\r\nturning out to be the worst. And the house crashed down. The causes\r\nof such a method of building were first: the absence of a complete\r\nand symmetrical plan among the Russian political parties, the whole\r\nenergy, mental and will tension of which were directed mainly towards\r\nthe destruction of the former order. For we cannot give the name of\r\npractical plans to the abstract outlines of the party programmes; they\r\nare rather lawful or unlawful diplomas for the right of building.\r\nSecondly--that the new ruling classes did not possess the most\r\nelementary technical knowledge of the art of ruling, as the result\r\nof a systematic, age-long setting them aside from these functions.\r\nThirdly--the non-forestalling of the will of the Constituent Assembly,\r\nwhich, in any case, called for heroic measures for its summoning,\r\nand therewith no less heroic measures for securing real freedom of\r\nelection. Fourthly--the odiousness of all that bore the stamp of\r\nthe old order, even though it were sound at bottom. Fifthly--the\r\nself-conceit of the political parties, each of which individually\r\nrepresented the \"will of the whole people\" and was distinguished by\r\nextreme irreconciliableness towards its antagonists.\r\n\r\nI might probably continue this list for a long time, but I shall pause\r\non one fact which has a significance which is far from being confined\r\nto the past. The Revolution was expected, it was prepared, but _no\r\none_, not a single one of the political groups _had prepared itself\r\nfor it_. And the Revolution came by night, finding everyone, like the\r\nfoolish virgins in the Gospel, with lamps unlit. One cannot explain and\r\nexcuse everything by elemental forces alone. No one had troubled to\r\nconstruct beforehand a general plan of the canals and sluices necessary\r\nto prevent the inundation from becoming a flood. Not one of the leading\r\nparties possessed a programme for the interregnum in the life of the\r\ncountry, a programme which, in its character and scale, could not\r\ncorrespond with normal plans of construction, either in the system of\r\nadministration or in the sphere of economic and social relations. It\r\nwould scarcely be an exaggeration to say that the only assets in the\r\npossession of the progressive and Socialist blocks on March 27th, 1917,\r\nwere: for the former--the choice for the post of Minister-President of\r\nPrince Lvov, for the latter--the Soviets and Order No. 1. After this\r\nbegan the convulsive, unsystematic vacillation of the Government and of\r\nthe Soviet.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that this difference, which constitutes a\r\nmarked distinction between two periods--the provisional and the\r\nconstructive--two systems, two programmes, has not yet become\r\nsufficiently clear in public consciousness.\r\n\r\nThe whole period of the active struggle with Bolshevism passed under\r\nthe sign of the mingling of these two systems, of divergent views and\r\nof incapacity to construct a provisional form of authority. It would\r\nseem that now, too, the anti-Bolshevist forces, while increasing the\r\ndivergence of their views and building plans for the future, are not\r\npreparing for the process of assuming the power after the downfall\r\nof Bolshevism, and will again approach the task with naked hands\r\nand wavering mind. Only now the process will be immeasurably more\r\ndifficult. For the second excuse--after \"elemental forces\"--for the\r\nfailure of the Revolution, or rather of its leading men--\"the heritage\r\nof the Czarist régime\"--has paled very much on the background of the\r\nsanguinary Bolshevist mist which has enveloped the land of Russia.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe new power (the Provisional Government) was faced by a question of\r\nthe first importance--the War. On its decision rested the fate of the\r\ncountry. The decision in favour of continuing the alliance and the\r\nWar rested on ethical motives, which at that time did not rouse any\r\ndoubts, and on practical motives, which were in some degree disputable.\r\nNow, even the former have been shaken, since both the Allies and the\r\nenemy have treated the fate of Russia with cruel, cynical egotism.\r\nNevertheless, I have no doubt of the correctness of the decision then\r\ntaken to continue the War. Many suppositions might be made as to the\r\npossibilities of a separate peace--whether that of Brest-Litovsk or one\r\nless grievous for the State and for our national self-love. But it is\r\nto be thought that such a peace in the spring of 1917 would have led\r\neither to the dismemberment of Russia and her economic _débâcle_ (a\r\ngeneral peace at the expense of Russia), or to the complete victory\r\nof the Central Powers over our Allies, which would have produced\r\nincomparably deeper convulsions in their countries than those which\r\nthe German people are now experiencing. Both in the one case and in\r\nthe other, no objective data would be present for any change for the\r\nbetter in the political, social and economic conditions of Russian life\r\nand any turning of the Russian Revolution into other channels. Only,\r\nbesides Bolshevism, Russia would have added to her liabilities the\r\nhatred of the defeated for many years.\r\n\r\nHaving decided to fight, it was necessary to preserve the Army by\r\nadmitting a certain conservatism into it. Such a conservatism serves\r\nas a guarantee for the stability of the Army and of that authority\r\nwhich seeks support in it. If the participation of the Army in\r\nhistorical cataclysms cannot be avoided, neither can it be turned into\r\nan arena for political struggle, creating, instead of the principle\r\nof service--_pretorians or opritchniks_, whether of the Czar, of the\r\nRevolutionary Democracy, or of any party is a matter of indifference.\r\n\r\nThe Army was broken up.\r\n\r\nOn those principles which the Revolutionary Democracy took as a basis\r\nfor the existence of the Army, the latter could neither build nor live.\r\nIt was no mere chance that all the later attempts at armed conflict\r\nwith Bolshevism began with the organisation of an Army on the normal\r\nprinciples of military administration, to which the Soviet command as\r\nwell sought to pass gradually. No elemental circumstances, no errors\r\non the part of military dictatorships and of the powers co-operating\r\nwith or opposing them which led to the failure of the struggle (of this\r\nsome truths will be spoken later) are able to cast this undeniable fact\r\ninto the shade. Nor is it a mere chance that the leading circles of\r\nthe Revolutionary Democracy could create no armed forces, except that\r\npitiful parody on them--the \"National Army\" on the so-called \"front of\r\nthe Constituent Assembly.\" It was just this circumstance that led the\r\nRussian Socialist emigrants to the theory of non-resistance, of the\r\nnegation of armed struggle, to the concentration of all their hopes\r\non the inner degeneration of Bolshevism and its overthrow by some\r\nimmaterial \"forces of the people themselves,\" which, however, could\r\nnot express themselves otherwise than by blood and iron: \"the great,\r\nbloodless\" Revolution is drowned in blood from its beginning to its end.\r\n\r\nTo refuse to consider that vast question--the re-creation of a National\r\nArmy on firm principles--is not to solve it.\r\n\r\nWhat then? On the day that Bolshevism falls will peace and good-will\r\nimmediately show forth in a land corrupted by a slavery worse than\r\nthat of the Tartar yoke, saturated with dissension, revenge, hatred,\r\nand ... an enormous quantity of arms? Or, from that day forward, will\r\nthe self-interested desires of many foreign Governments disappear, or\r\nwill they grow stronger when the menace of the moral infection of the\r\nSoviet has vanished? Finally, even should the whole of old Europe,\r\nmorally regenerated, beat out its swords into ploughshares, is it\r\nimpossible for a new Tchingiz-Khan to come out of the depths of that\r\nAsia which has accounts age-long and huge beyond measure, against\r\nEurope?\r\n\r\nThe Army will be regenerated. Of that there can be no doubt.\r\n\r\nShaken in its historical foundations and traditions, like the heroes\r\nof the Russian legends, it will stand for no short time at the\r\ncross-roads, gazing anxiously into the misty distances, still wrapped\r\nin the gloom before the dawn, and listening intently to the vague\r\nsounds of the voices calling to it. And among the delusive calls it\r\nwill seek, straining its hearing to the utmost, for the real voice ...\r\nthe voice of its own people.\r\n\r\n\r\n            PRINTED BY THE FIELD PRESS LTD., WINDSOR HOUSE,\r\n                   BREAM'S BUILDINGS, LONDON, E.C. 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] _Barin_ is the Russian word for master.

(Protocol Appendix XIII. to Kornilov's\r\ndeposition.)\r\n\r\n[67] As we shall see later, Savinkov stated in his evidence that\r\nhe \"suggested no political combinations in the name of the\r\nMinister-President.\"\r\n\r\n[68] The \"Kornilov programme\" is meant here.\r\n\r\n[69] The Commanders-in-Chief of the other Fronts sent the Provisional\r\nGovernment telegrams of a completely loyal nature on August 28th. Their\r\ntenor is seen from the following extracts: \"Northern Front--General\r\nKlembovsky: Consider change in Supreme Command extremely dangerous\r\nwhen the threat of an external enemy to the integrity of our native\r\nland and our freedom demands the speedy adoption of measures for the\r\nstrengthening of the discipline and fighting value of our Army.\"\r\n\"Western Front--General Baluev: The present situation of Russia demands\r\nthe immediate adoption of exceptional measures, and the retention of\r\nGeneral Kornilov at the head of the Army is an imperative necessity,\r\nno matter what the political situation.\" \"Roumanian Front--General\r\nScherbachev: The dismissal of General Kornilov will infallibly have a\r\nfatal effect on the Army and the defence of the Motherland. I appeal to\r\nyour patriotism in the name of the salvation of our native land.\" All\r\nthe Commanders-in-Chief mentioned the necessity for the introduction of\r\nthe measures demanded by Kornilov.\r\n\r\n[70] This telegram was not received at Headquarters. Kerensky gives the\r\nepisode with Lvov thus: \"On August 26th General Kornilov sent to me Vv.\r\nN. Lvov, member of the State Duma, with a demand that the Provisional\r\nGovernment should cede all its military and civil authority, leaving\r\nhim to form a Government for the country in accordance with his own\r\npersonal views.\"\r\n\r\n[71] On the morning of the 29th a telegram from the Quartermaster-General\r\nat the Stavka somehow reached us, in which again hopes of a peaceful\r\nsettlement were held out.\r\n\r\n[72] He went through the Kouban campaigns with the Volunteer Army and\r\nserved in it to the day of his death, from spotted typhus, in 1920.\r\n\r\n[73] Official communication.\r\n\r\n[74] The members of the Commission were: Col.
