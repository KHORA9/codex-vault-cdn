CLUTTERBUCK'S ELECTION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the late Queen Victoria's reign there resided in the\r\nsuburban town of Croydon a gentleman of the name of Clutterbuck, who,\r\nupon a modest capital inherited from his father, contrived by various\r\nnegotiations at his office in the City of London to gain an income of\r\nnow some seven hundred, now more nearly a thousand, pounds in the year.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that a war of unprecedented dimensions was\r\nraging, at the time of which I speak, in the sub-continent of South\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nThe President of the South African Republic, thinking the moment\r\npropitious for a conquest of our dominions, had invaded our territory\r\nafter an ultimatum of incredible insolence, and, as though it were\r\nnot sufficient that we should grapple foe to foe upon equal terms,\r\nthe whole weight of the Orange Free State was thrown into the scale\r\nagainst us.\r\n\r\nThe struggle against the combined armies which had united to destroy\r\nthis country was long and arduous, and had we been compelled to rely\r\nupon our regular forces alone things might have gone ill. As it was,\r\nthe enthusiasm of Colonial manhood and the genius of the generals\r\nprevailed. The names of Kitchener, Methuen, Baden-Powell, and Rhodes\r\nwill ever remain associated with that of the Commander-in-Chief\r\nhimself, Lord Roberts, who in less than three years from the decisive\r\nvictory of Paardeburg imposed peace upon the enemy. Their territories\r\nwere annexed in a series of thirty-seven proclamations, and form to-day\r\nthe brightest jewel in the Imperial crown.\r\n\r\nThese facts--which must be familiar to many of my readers--I only\r\nrecall in order to show what influence they had in the surprising\r\nrevolutions of fortune which enabled Mr. Clutterbuck to pass from ease\r\nto affluence, and launched him upon public life.\r\n\r\nThe business which Mr. Clutterbuck had inherited from his father was\r\na small agency chiefly concerned with the Baltic trade. This business\r\nhad declined; for Mr. Clutterbuck's father had failed to follow the\r\nrapid concentration of commercial effort which is the mark of our\r\ntime. But Mr. Clutterbuck had inherited, besides the business, a sum\r\nof close upon ten thousand pounds in various securities: it was upon\r\nthe manipulation of this that he principally depended, and though\r\nhe maintained the sign of the old agency at the office, it was the\r\ncautious buying and selling of stocks which he carefully watched,\r\nvarious opportunities of promotion in a small way, commissions, and\r\noccasional speculations in kind, that procured his constant though\r\nsomewhat irregular income. To these sources he would sometimes add\r\nprivate advances or covering mortgages upon the stock of personal\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nIt was a venture of the latter sort which began the transformation of\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\nThe last negotiations of the war were not yet wholly completed, nor had\r\nthe coronation of his present Majesty taken place when, in the early\r\nsummer of 1902, a neighbour of the name of Boyle called one evening at\r\nMr. Clutterbuck's house.\r\n\r\nMr. Boyle, a man of Mr. Clutterbuck's own age, close upon fifty,\r\nand himself a bachelor, had long enjoyed the acquaintance both of\r\nMr. Clutterbuck and of his wife. Some years ago, indeed, when Mr.\r\nBoyle resided at the Elms, the acquaintance had almost ripened into\r\nfriendship, but Mr. Boyle's ill-health, not unconnected with financial\r\nworries, and later his change of residence to 15 John Bright\r\nGardens had somewhat estranged the two households. It was therefore\r\nwith a certain solemnity that Mr. Boyle was received into the neat\r\nsitting-room where the Clutterbucks were accustomed to pass the time\r\nbetween tea and the hour of their retirement.\r\n\r\nThey were shocked to see how aged Mr. Boyle appeared: he formed, as\r\nhe sat there opposite them, the most complete contrast with the man\r\nwhose counsel and support he had come to seek. For Mr. Clutterbuck was\r\nsomewhat stout in figure, of a roundish face with a thick and short\r\nmoustache making a crescent upon it. He was bald as to the top of his\r\nhead, and brushed across it a large thin fan of his still dark hair.\r\nHis forehead was high, since he was bald; his complexion healthy. But\r\nMr. Boyle, clean-shaven, with deep-set, restless grey eyes, and a\r\nforehead ornamented with corners, seemed almost foreign; so hard were\r\nthe lines of his face and so abundant his curly and crisp grey hair.\r\nHis gestures also were nervous. He clasped and unclasped his hands, and\r\nas he delivered--at long intervals--his first common-place remarks, his\r\neyes darted from one object to another, but never met his host's: he\r\nwas very ill.\r\n\r\nHis evident hesitation instructed Mrs. Clutterbuck that he had come\r\nupon some important matter; she therefore gathered up the yellow\r\nsatin centre, upon the embroidery of which she had been engaged, and\r\ndelicately left the room.\r\n\r\nWhen she had noiselessly shut the door behind her, Mr. Boyle, looking\r\nearnestly at the fire, said abruptly:\r\n\r\n\"What I have come about to-night, Mr. Clutterbuck, is a business\r\nproposition.\" Having said this, he extended the fore and middle fingers\r\nof his right hand in the gesture of an episcopal benediction, and\r\ntapped them twice upon the palm of his left; which done, he repeated\r\nhis phrase: \"A business proposition\"; cleared his throat and said no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck's reply to this was to approach a chiffonier, to squat\r\ndown suddenly before it in the attitude of a frog, to unlock it, and\r\nto bring out a cut glass decanter containing whiskey. The whiskey was\r\nScotch; and as Mr. Clutterbuck straightened himself and set it upon\r\nthe table, he looked down upon Mr. Boyle with a look of property and\r\nknowledge, winked solemnly and said:\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mr. Boyle! This is something you won't get everywhere. Pitt put\r\nme up to it.\" He made a slight gesture with his left hand. \"Simply\r\ncouldn't be bought; that's what Pitt said. Not in the market! Say\r\nwhen\"--and with a firm smile he poured the whiskey into a glass which\r\nhe set by Mr. Boyle's side, and next poured a far smaller amount into\r\nhis own. Indeed it was a feature of this epoch-making interview that\r\nthe sound business instinct of Mr. Clutterbuck restrained him to a\r\ngreat moderation as he listened to his guest's advances.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Boyle had drunk the first glass of that whiskey which Mr. Pitt\r\nhad so kindly recommended to Mr. Clutterbuck, he was moved to continue:\r\n\r\n\"It's like this: if you'll meet me man to man, we can do business.\" He\r\nthen murmured: \"I've thought a good deal about this\"--and while Mr.\r\nBoyle was indulging in these lucid preliminaries, Mr. Clutterbuck, who\r\nthoroughly approved of them, nodded solemnly several times.\r\n\r\n\"What I've got to put before you,\" said Mr. Boyle, shifting in\r\nhis seat, gazing earnestly at Mr. Clutterbuck and speaking with\r\nconcentrated emphasis, \"is eggs!\"\r\n\r\n\"Eggs?\" said Mr. Clutterbuck with just that tone of contempt which the\r\nother party to a bargain should assume, and with just as much curiosity\r\nas would permit the conversation to continue.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, eggs,\" said Mr. Boyle firmly; then in a grand tone he added,\r\n\"a million of 'em.... There!\" And Mr. Boyle turned his head round as\r\ntriumphantly as a sick man can, and filled up his glass again with\r\nwhiskey and water.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck, \"what about your million eggs? What you\r\nwant? Are you buying 'em or selling 'em, or what?\"\r\n\r\nThe somewhat unconventional rapidity of Mr. Clutterbuck did not disturb\r\nMr. Boyle. He leaned forward again and said: \"I've only come to you\r\nbecause it's you. I knew you'd see it if any man would, and I thought\r\nI'd give you the first chance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck slowly, \"but how do you mean? Is it buying\r\nor selling, or what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither,\" said Mr. Boyle, and then like a horse taking a hedge, he out\r\nwith the whole business and said:\r\n\r\n\"It's cover. I want to carry on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said Mr. Clutterbuck deliberately cold, \"that's a question of\r\nhow much and on what terms. Though for the matter of business from one\r\ngentleman to another, I don't see what a million eggs anyhow, if you\r\nunderstand me....\"\r\n\r\nHere he began to think, and Mr. Boyle nodded intelligently to show that\r\nhe completely followed the train of Mr. Clutterbuck's thought.\r\n\r\nMr. Boyle filled his glass again with whiskey and waited, but Mr.\r\nClutterbuck, who had ever appreciated the importance of sobriety in\r\nthe relations of commerce, confined himself to occasional sips at his\r\noriginal allowance. When some intervals of silence had passed between\r\nthem in this manner, and when Mr. Boyle had, now for the fourth time,\r\nreplenished his glass, Mr. Clutterbuck, who could by this time survey\r\nthe whole scheme in a lucid and organised fashion, repeated the number\r\nof eggs, to wit, one million, and after a considerable pause repeated\r\nalso the fundamental proposition that it was a question of how much and\r\nupon what terms.\r\n\r\nMr. Boyle, staring at the fire and apparently obtaining some help from\r\nit, made answer: \"A thousand.\"\r\n\r\nA lesser man than Mr. Clutterbuck would perhaps have professed\r\nastonishment at so large a sum; he, however, like all men destined for\r\ncommercial greatness at any period, however tardy, in their lives, said\r\nquietly:\r\n\r\n\"More like five hundred.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck had not yet divided one million by a thousand or by\r\nfive hundred; still less had he estimated the probable selling value\r\nof an egg; but he was a little astonished to hear Mr. Boyle say with\r\nlifted eyebrows and a haughty expression: \"Done with you!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not done with me at all,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck hotly, as Mr.\r\nBoyle poured out a fifth glass of whiskey and water. \"It's not done\r\nwith me at all! Wait till you see my bit of paper!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Boyle assumed a look of weariness. \"My dear sir,\" he said, \"I was\r\nonly speaking as one gentleman would to another.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck nodded solemnly.\r\n\r\n\"It's not a matter of five hundred or a thousand between men like you\r\nand me.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck still nodded.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not here to see your name in ink. I'm here to make a business\r\nproposition.\"\r\n\r\nHaving said so much he rose to go. And Mr. Clutterbuck, appreciating\r\nthat he had gained one of those commercial victories which are often\r\nthe foundation of a great fortune, said: \"I'll come and see 'em\r\nto-morrow. Current rate.\"\r\n\r\n\"One above the Bank,\" said Mr. Boyle, and they parted friends.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Boyle was gone, Mr. Clutterbuck reclined some little time in\r\na complete blank: a form of repose in which men of high capacity in\r\norganisation often recuperate from moments of intense activity. In this\r\nposture he remained for perhaps half an hour, and then went in, not\r\nwithout hesitation, to see his wife.\r\n\r\nEighteen years of married life had rendered Mrs. Clutterbuck's features\r\nand manner familiar to her husband. It is well that the reader also\r\nshould have some idea of her presence. She habitually dressed in black;\r\nher hair, which had never been abundant, was of the same colour, and\r\nshone with extraordinary precision. She was accustomed to part it in\r\nthe middle, and to bring it down upon either side of her forehead.\r\nIt was further to be remarked that round her neck, which was long\r\nand slender, she wore a velvet band after a fashion which royalty\r\nitself had not disdained to inaugurate. At her throat was a locket\r\nof considerable size containing initials worked in human hair; upon\r\nher wrists, according to the severity of the season, she wore or\r\ndid not wear mittens as dark as the rest of her raiment. She spoke\r\nbut little, save in the presence of her husband; her gestures were\r\nrestrained and purposeful, her walk somewhat rapid; and her accent that\r\nof a cultivated gentlewoman of the middle sort; her grammar perfect.\r\nHer idiom, however, when it was not a trifle selected, occasionally\r\nerred. Her hours and diet are little to my purpose, but it is perhaps\r\nworth while to note that she rose at seven, and was accustomed to eat\r\nbreakfast an hour afterwards, while hot meat in the middle of the day\r\nand cold meat after her husband's office hours, formed her principal\r\nmeals. Her recreations were few but decided, and she had the method to\r\nattack them at regular seasons. She left Croydon three times in the\r\nyear, once to visit her family at Berkhampstead, to which rural village\r\nher father had retired after selling his medical practice; once to the\r\nseaside, and once to spend a few days in the heart of London, during\r\nwhich holiday it was her custom to visit the principal theatres in the\r\ncompany of her husband.\r\n\r\nShe had no children, and was active upon those four societies which, at\r\nthe time of which I speak, formed a greater power for social good than\r\nany others in Croydon--the Charity Organisation Society, the Society\r\nfor the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, a similar society which\r\nguaranteed a similar immunity to the children of the poor, and the\r\nAssociation for the Reform of the Abuses prevalent in the Congo \"Free\"\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThough often solicited to give her aid, experience and subscriptions\r\nto many another body intent upon the uplifting of the lower classes,\r\nshe had ever strictly confined herself to these four alone, which, she\r\nfelt, absorbed the whole of her available energy. She had, however,\r\nupon two occasions, consented to take a stall for our Dumb Friends'\r\nLeague, and had once been patroness of a local ball given in support of\r\nthe Poor Brave Things. In religion she was, I need hardly add, of the\r\nAnglican persuasion, in which capacity she attended the church of the\r\nRev. Isaac Fowle; though she was not above worshipping with her fellow\r\ncitizens of other denominations when social duty or the accident of\r\nhospitality demanded such a courtesy.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Clutterbuck entered, Mrs. Clutterbuck continued her work of\r\nembroidery at the yellow centre, putting her needle through the fabric\r\nwith a vigour and decision which spoke volumes for the restrained\r\nenergy of her character; nor was she the first to speak.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck, standing at the fire parting his coat tails and\r\nlooking up toward that ornament in the ceiling whence depended the gas\r\npipe, said boldly: \"Well, he got nothing out of _me_!\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Clutterbuck, without lifting her eyes, replied as rapidly as her\r\nneedlework: \"I don't want to hear about your business affairs, Mr.\r\nClutterbuck. I leave gentlemen to what concerns gentlemen. I hope I\r\nknow _my_ work, and that I don't interfere where I might only make\r\ntrouble.\" It is remarkable that after this preface she should have\r\nadded: \"Though why you let every beggar who darkens this door make a\r\nfool of you is more than I can understand.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck was at some pains and at great length to explain that\r\nthe imaginary transaction which disturbed his wife's equanimity had\r\nnot taken place, but his volubility had no other effect than to call\r\nfrom her, under a further misapprehension, a rebuke with regard to his\r\nexcess in what she erroneously called \"wine.\" Her sympathetic remarks\r\nupon Mr. Boyle's state of health and her trust that her husband had not\r\ntoo much taxed his failing energies, did little to calm that business\r\nman's now legitimate irritation, and it must be confessed that when\r\nhis wife rose in a commanding manner and left the room to put all in\r\norder before retiring, a dark shadow of inner insecurity overcast the\r\nmerchant's mind.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps on this account that he left next day for the City by\r\nthe 8.32 instead of taking, as was his custom, the 9.17; and that,\r\nstill moody after dealing with his correspondence, he sought the office\r\nof Mr. Boyle in Mark Lane.\r\n\r\nAs he went through the cold and clear morning with the activity and\r\nhurry of the City about him, he could review the short episode of the\r\nnight before in a clearer light and with more justice. His irritation\r\nat his wife's remarks had largely disappeared; he had recognised that\r\nsuch irritation is always the worst of counsellors in a business\r\nmatter; he remembered Mr. Boyle's long career, and though that career\r\nhad been checkered, and though of late they had seen less of each\r\nother, he could not but contrast the smallness of the favour demanded\r\nwith the still substantial household and the public name of his friend.\r\nHe further recollected, as he went rapidly eastward, more than one such\r\nlittle transaction which had proved profitable to him in the past,\r\nnot only in cash, but, what was more important to him, in business\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\nIt was in such a mood that he reached Mr. Boyle's office: his first\r\nemotion was one of surprise at the fineness of the place. He had\r\nnot entered it for many years, but during those years he had hardly\r\nrepresented Mr. Boyle to himself as a man rising in the world. He was\r\nsurprised, and agreeably surprised; and when one of the many clerks\r\ninformed him that Mr. Boyle was down at the docks seeing to the\r\nwarehouse, he took accurate directions of the place where he might find\r\nhim, and went off in a better frame of mind; nay, in some readiness to\r\nmake an advance upon that original quotation of five hundred which,\r\nhe was now free to admit, had been accepted by Mr. Boyle with more\r\ncomposure than he had expected.\r\n\r\nHe was further impressed as he left the office to see upon a brass\r\nplate the new name of Czernwitz added to Mr. Boyle's and to note the\r\nseveral lines of telephone which radiated from the central cabin that\r\nserved the whole premises.\r\n\r\nCommercial requirements are many, complicated, delicate and often\r\nsecret; nor was Mr. Clutterbuck so simple as to contrast the excellent\r\nappointments of the office and the air of prosperity which permeated\r\nit, with the personal and private offer for an advance which Mr. Boyle\r\nhad been good enough to make.\r\n\r\nThe partnership of which Mr. Boyle was a member was evidently\r\nsound--the name of Czernwitz was enough to show that; there could\r\nbe little doubt of the banking support behind such an establishment;\r\nbut the relations between partners often involve special details of\r\nwhich the outside world is ignorant, the moment might be one in which\r\nit was inconvenient to approach the bank in the name of the firm; a\r\nlarge concession might, for all he knew, have just been obtained for\r\nsome common purpose; Mr. Boyle himself might have in hand a personal\r\nventure bearing no relation to the transactions of the partnership;\r\nhe might even very probably be gathering, from more than one quarter,\r\nsuch small sums as he required for the moment. A man must have but\r\nlittle acquaintance with the City whose imagination could not suggest\r\nsuch contingencies, and upon an intimate acquaintance with the City and\r\nall its undercurrents Mr. Clutterbuck very properly prided himself.\r\nDuring that brief walk all these considerations were at work in Mr.\r\nClutterbuck's mind, and severally leading him to an act of generosity\r\nwhich the future was amply to justify.\r\n\r\nHe went down to the docks; he entered the warehouse, and was there\r\nastonished to observe so many cases, each so full of brine, and that\r\nbrine so packed with such a vast assemblage of eggs held beneath the\r\nsurface by wire lattices, that an impression of incalculable wealth\r\nsoon occupied the whole of his spirit; for he perceived not only the\r\npaltry million in which Mr. Boyle had apparently embarked some private\r\nmoneys (the boxes were marked with his name), but the vast stores of\r\nperhaps twenty other merchants who had rallied round England in her\r\nhour of need and had prepared an inexhaustible supply of sterilised\r\norganic albumenoids for the gallant lads at the front.\r\n\r\nHe went up several stairs through what must have been three hundred\r\nyards of corridor with eggs and eggs and eggs on every side--it seemed\r\nto him a mile--he pushed through a dusty door and saw at last the goal\r\nof his journey: Mr. Boyle himself. Mr. Boyle was wearing a dazzling\r\ntop hat, he was dressed in a brilliant cashmere twill relieved by a\r\nlarge yellow flower in his buttonhole, and was seated before a little\r\ninstrument wherein an electric lamp, piercing the translucency of a\r\nsample egg, determined whether it were or were not still suitable for\r\nhuman food.\r\n\r\nMr. Boyle recognised his visitor, nodded in a courteous but not\r\neffusive way, and continued his observations. He rose at last, and\r\noffered Mr. Clutterbuck a squint (an offer which that gentleman was\r\nglad to accept), and explained to him the working of the test; then he\r\nremoved the egg from its position before the electric lamp, deposited\r\nit with care beneath the brine under that section of the lattice to\r\nwhich it belonged, and said with a heartiness which his illness could\r\nnot entirely destroy: \"What brings you here?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck in some astonishment referred to their conversation of\r\nthe night before.\r\n\r\nMr. Boyle laughed as soundly as a sick man can, coughed rather\r\nviolently after the laugh, and said: \"Oh, I'd forgotten all about\r\nit--it doesn't matter. I've seen Benskin this morning, and there's no\r\nhurry.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Boyle,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck warmly.\r\n\r\nMr. Boyle waved him away with his hand. \"My dear fellow,\" he said,\r\n\"don't let's have any explanations. I saw you didn't like the look of\r\nit, and, after all, what does it matter? If one has to carry on for a\r\nday or two one can always find what one wants. It was silly of me to\r\nhave talked to you about it. But when a man's ill he sometimes does\r\ninjudicious things.\"\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Boyle was again overcome with a very sharp and hacking cough\r\nwhich was pitiful to hear.\r\n\r\n\"You don't understand me, Boyle,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck with dignity\r\nand yet with assurance. \"If it was a matter of friendship I'd do it at\r\nonce; but I can see perfectly well it's a matter of business as well,\r\nand you ought to allow me to combine both: I've known you long enough!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Boyle, after a further fit of coughing, caught his breath and said:\r\n\"You mean I ought to go to Benskin and let you in for part of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Boyle,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck, now quite at his ease, \"let me\r\nin for the whole of it, or what you like. After all, when you spoke\r\nabout the matter last night it was sudden, and----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know, I know,\" said Mr. Boyle, impatiently, \"that's what I'm\r\nlike.... You see I've twenty things to think of--these eggs are only\r\npart of it; and if I were to realise, as I could....\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck cut him short: \"Don't talk like that, Boyle,\" he said,\r\n\"I'll sign it here and now; and you shall send me the papers when you\r\nlike.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" said Mr. Boyle, \"that's not business. I'll introduce you to\r\nBenskin and you can talk it over.\"\r\n\r\nWith that he began to lead the way towards Mr. Benskin's office, when\r\nhe suddenly thought better of it, and said: \"Look here, Clutterbuck,\r\nthis is the best way: I'll send you the papers. I'm in for a lot more\r\nthan a million, but I'll earmark that million--eggs I mean. I won't\r\nbring Benskin into it, I'll send you the papers and when your six and\r\neight-penny has passed 'em, you can hand over the risk if you like. I\r\nwant it, I tell you frankly, I want several of 'em, and I'm getting 'em\r\nall round; but there's no good letting everybody know. I won't touch\r\nyour envelope or your pink slip till you've had the papers and got them\r\npassed. They're all made up, I'll send them round.\"\r\n\r\nIn vain did Mr. Clutterbuck protest that for so small a sum as £500\r\nit was ridiculous that there should be formalities between friends.\r\nMr. Boyle, alternately coughing and wagging his head, was adamant upon\r\nthe matter. He led Mr. Clutterbuck back through the acres of preserved\r\neggs, choosing such avenues as afforded the best perspective of these\r\ninnumerable supplies, crossed with him the space before the Minories,\r\nre-entered, still coughing, the narrowness of Mark Lane, and promising\r\nMr. Clutterbuck the papers within a few hours, turned into his own\r\ngreat doors.\r\n\r\nLong before those hours were expired Mr. Clutterbuck had made up his\r\nmind: he knew the value of informal promptitude in such cases. He had\r\nhardly reached his own offices in Leadenhall Street, he had barely had\r\ntime to take off his overcoat, to hang his hat upon a peg, to cover his\r\ncuffs with paper, to change into his office coat, and to take his seat\r\nat his desk, when he dictated a note relative to an advance in Perus,\r\nsigned his cheque for five hundred and sent it round by a private\r\nmessenger with a few warm lines in his own handwriting such as should\r\naccompany a good deed wisely done.\r\n\r\nHe was contented with himself, he appreciated, not without justice, the\r\nrapidity and the sureness of his judgment; he withdrew the paper from\r\nhis cuffs, put on his City coat and his best City hat, and determined\r\nto afford himself a meal worthy of so excellent a transaction. But\r\ngenius, however lucid and immediate, is fated to endure toil as much\r\nas it is to enjoy vision; and this excellent speculation, greatly\r\nand deservedly as it was to enhance Mr. Clutterbuck's commercial\r\nreputation, was not yet safe in harbour.\r\n\r\nHe returned late from his lunch, which he had rounded up with coffee in\r\nthe company of a few friends. It was nearly four. He asked carelessly\r\nif any papers had reached him from Mr. Boyle's office or elsewhere,\r\nand, finding they had been delayed, he went home without more ado,\r\nto return for them in the morning. He reached Croydon not a little\r\nexhilarated and pleased at the successes of the day--for he had had\r\nminor successes also; he had sold Pernambucos at 16-1/2 just before\r\nthey fell. In such a mood he committed the imprudence of making Mrs.\r\nClutterbuck aware, though in the vaguest terms, that her opinion of Mr.\r\nBoyle was harsh, and that his own judgment of the man had risen not a\r\nlittle from what he had seen that day. The lady's virtuous silence\r\nspurred him to further arguments, and though his confidences entered\r\ninto no details and certainly betrayed nothing of the main business,\r\nyet the next morning as he reviewed the conversation in his mind, he\r\nregretted it.\r\n\r\nHe approached his office on that second day in a sober mood, prepared\r\nto scan the document which he awaited, and, if necessary, to visit his\r\nlawyer. No document was there; but Mr. Clutterbuck had had experience\r\nof the leisure of a solicitor's office, and, in youth, too many\r\nreminders of the results of interference to hasten its operation. What\r\ndid surprise him, however, and that most legitimately, was the absence\r\nof any word of acknowledgment from his friend, in spite of the fact\r\nthat the cheque had been cashed, as he discovered, the day before at\r\na few minutes past twelve. Of all courses precipitation is the worst.\r\nMr. Clutterbuck occupied himself with other matters; worked hard at\r\nthe Warra-Mugga report, mastered it; sold Perterssens for Warra-Muggas\r\n(a very wise transaction); and returned home in a thoughtful mood by a\r\nlate train.\r\n\r\nThe first news with which Mrs. Clutterbuck greeted him was the sudden\r\nand serious illness of Mr. Boyle, who was lying between life and death\r\nat 15 John Bright Gardens. As she announced this fact to her husband,\r\nshe looked at him in a manner suggestive neither of conciliation, nor\r\nof violence, nor of weakness, but, as it were, of calm control; and Mr.\r\nClutterbuck, acting upon mixed emotions, among which anxiety was not\r\nthe least, went out at once to have news of his friend. All that he\r\ncould hear from the servant at the door was that the doctor would admit\r\nno visitor; that her master was extremely ill, but that he was expected\r\nto survive the night.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck hurried back home in a considerable confusion of mind,\r\nand was glad to find, as he approached his house, that everything was\r\ndark.\r\n\r\nNext morning he postponed his journey to the City to call again as\r\nearly as he decently could at 15 John Bright Gardens. Alas! the blinds\r\nwere drawn at every window. The Dread Reaper had passed.\r\n\r\nThe effect produced by this calamity upon Mr. Clutterbuck was such\r\nas would have thrown a more emotional man quite off his balance. The\r\nloss of so near a neighbour, the death of a man with whom but fifty\r\nhours ago he had been in intimate conversation, was in itself a shock\r\nof dangerous violence. When there was added to this shock his natural\r\ndoubts upon the status of the Million Eggs, it is not to be wondered\r\nthat a sort of distraction followed. He ran, quite forgetful of his\r\ndignity, to the nearest telephone cabin, rang up his office in the\r\nCity, was given the wrong number, in his agony actually forgot to\r\nrepeat the right number again, dashed out without paying, returned\r\nto fulfil this formality, pelted away toward the station, missed the\r\n11.28, and, such was his bewildered mood, leapt upon a tram as though\r\nthis were the quickest means of reaching information.\r\n\r\nIn a quarter of an hour a little calm was restored to him, though by\r\nthis time the rapid electric service of the Electric Traction Syndicate\r\nhad carried him far beyond the limits of Croydon. He got out at a\r\nroadside office, wrote out and tore up again half a dozen telegrams,\r\nseized a time-table, determined that after all the train was his best\r\nrefuge, and catching the 12.17 at Norwood Junction, found himself\r\nin the heart of the City before half-past one. A hansom took him to\r\nhis office after several intolerable but unavoidable delays in the\r\nhalf-mile it had to traverse. His visible perturbation was a matter of\r\ncomment to his subordinates, who were not slow to inform him before he\r\nopened his mouth that the documents had not yet arrived.\r\n\r\nExhaustion followed so much feverish activity, an anxiety, deeper if\r\npossible than any he had yet shown, settled upon Mr. Clutterbuck's\r\nfeatures. He forgot to lunch, he walked deliberately to the warehouse,\r\nonly to be asked what his business might be, and to be told that the\r\nparticular section of eggs which he named were the property of Messrs.\r\nCzernwitz and Boyle, and could be visited by no one without their\r\nwritten order.\r\n\r\nThe tone in which this astonishing message was delivered would have\r\nstung a man of less sensitiveness and breeding than Mr. Clutterbuck;\r\nhe turned upon his heel in a mood to which anger was now added, and\r\nimmediately sought the office of that firm. But he was doomed to yet\r\nfurther delay. No one was in who could give him any useful information,\r\nnor even any one of so much responsibility as to be able to explain to\r\nhim the extraordinary occurrences of the last few days.\r\n\r\nHe was at the point of a very grave decision--I mean of going on to\r\nhis lawyers and perhaps disturbing to no sort of purpose the most\r\ndelicate of commercial relations--when there moved past him into the\r\noffice the ponderous and well-clad form of a gentleman past middle age,\r\nwith such magnificent white whiskers as adorn the faces of too many\r\nContinental bankers, and wearing a simple bowler hat of exquisite shape\r\nand workmanship. He was smoking a cigar of considerable size and of\r\ndelicious flavour, and by the deference immediately paid to him upon\r\nhis entry, Mr. Clutterbuck, as he stood in nervous anxiety by the door,\r\ncould distinguish the head of the firm.\r\n\r\nIt was characteristic of the Baron de Czernwitz, and in some sort\r\nan explanation of his future success in our business world, ever\r\nso suspicious of the foreigner, that the moment he had heard Mr.\r\nClutterbuck's name and business, he turned to him, in spite of his many\r\npreoccupations, with the utmost courtesy and said:\r\n\r\n\"It iss myself you want? You shall come hier.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words he put his arm in the most gentlemanly manner through\r\nthat of his exhausted visitor, and led him into an inner room furnished\r\nwith all the taste and luxury which the Baron had learnt in Naples,\r\nWurtemburg, Dantzig, Paris, and New York.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Clottorbug, Mr. Clottorbug,\" he said leaning backwards and\r\nsurveying the English merchant with an almost paternal interest, \"what\r\niss it I can do for you?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck, quite won by such a manner, unfolded the whole\r\nbusiness. As he did so the Baron's face became increasingly grave. At\r\nlast he took a slip of paper and noted on it one or two points--the\r\namount, the date, and time of the transaction. This he gravely folded\r\ninto four, and as gravely placed within a Russian leather pocket-book\r\nwhich contained, apart from certain masonic engagements, a considerable\r\nquantity of bank notes wrapped round an inner core of letter paper.\r\n\r\nI cannot deny that Mr. Clutterbuck expected little from this just if\r\ngood-natured man. The Baron, with whose name he was familiar, had no\r\nconcern with, and no responsibility in, the most unfortunate accident\r\nwhich had befallen him. To make the interview (whose inevitable\r\ntermination he thought he could foresee) the easier, Mr. Clutterbuck\r\nmurmured that no doubt the firm of solicitors were preparing the\r\npapers, and that they would be in his hands within a brief delay. The\r\nBaron smiled largely and wagged his ponderous head.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! noh!\" he said, and then added, as though he were summing up the\r\nthoughts of many years, \"He voss a bad egg!\"\r\n\r\nSuch an epithet applied to a friend but that moment dead might have\r\nshocked Mr. Clutterbuck under other circumstances; as things were, he\r\ncould not entirely disagree with the verdict; and when he had informed\r\nthe financier that Mr. Boyle's name had been placed separately from\r\nhis partner's upon the boxes of the firm, even that expression seemed\r\nhardly strong enough to voice M. de Czernwitz's feelings.\r\n\r\nHe next learned from the Baron's own lips how from senior partner Mr.\r\nBoyle had sunk to a salaried position; how even so he had but been\r\nretained through the kindness of the Baron; how he had more than once\r\ninvolved himself in petty gambling, and how the Baron had more than\r\nonce actually paid the debts resulting from that mania; how his name\r\nhad been kept upon the plate only after the most urgent entreaties\r\nand to save his pride; and how the Baron now saw that this act of\r\ngenerosity had been not only unwise but perhaps unjust in its effect\r\nupon the outer world.\r\n\r\nWhen he had concluded his statement the nobleman knocked the ash from\r\nhis cigar in such a manner that part of it fell upon Mr. Clutterbuck's\r\ntrousers, and surveyed that gentleman with a shade of sadness for some\r\nmoments.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck rose as though to go, saying, as he did so, that he had\r\nno business to detain his host, that he must bear his own loss, and\r\nthat there was no more to be done. But the Baron, half rising, placed\r\nupon his shoulder a hand of such weight as compelled him to be seated.\r\n\r\n\"You shall _not_ soffer!\" he exclaimed to Mr. Clutterbuck's mingled\r\namazement and delight. He spent the next few minutes in devising a\r\nplan, and at last suggested that Mr. Clutterbuck should be permitted\r\nto purchase at a nominal price, the unhappy Million Eggs which were at\r\nthe root of all this tragedy. He rang the bell for certain quotations\r\nand letters recently despatched by his firm; he satisfied the merchant\r\nof the prices to be obtained from Government under contracts which,\r\nhe was careful to point out, ran \"until hostilities in South Africa\r\nshould have ceased\"; he pointed out the advantages which so distant and\r\nindeterminate a date offered to the seller; and he concluded by putting\r\nthe stock at Mr. Clutterbuck's disposal for £250.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck's gratitude knew no bounds. He was accustomed to the\r\nhard, dry, unimaginative temper of our English houses, and there swam\r\nin his eyes that salt humour which survives, alas! so rarely in the\r\neyes of men over forty. He shook the Baron's left hand warmly--the\r\nright was occupied with the stump of the cigar--he reiterated his\r\nobligation, and came back to his own office with the gaiety of boyhood.\r\n\r\nHe found M. de Czernwitz a very different man of business from the\r\nunhappy fellow who had now gone to his account. Before five o'clock\r\neverything was in order, and he slept that night the possessor in\r\nlaw (and, as his solicitor was careful to advise him, in fact also)\r\nof One Million Eggs, supply for the army in South Africa during\r\nthe continuance of hostilities, and acquired by the substantial but\r\nmoderate total investment of £750.\r\n\r\nSo true is it that probity and generosity go hand in hand with success\r\nin the world-wide commerce of our land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are accidents in business against which no good fortune nor even\r\nthe largest generosity can protect us.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck woke the next morning, after a night of such repose as\r\nhe had not lately enjoyed. The June morning in that delightful Surrey\r\nair awoke all the perfumes of his small but well-ordered garden, and\r\nhe sauntered with a light step down its neat gravel paths, reflecting\r\nupon his new property, considering what advice he should take, whether\r\nto hold it for the necessities that might arise later in the year if\r\nthe campaign should take a more difficult turn, or whether it would\r\nbe found the experience of such of his friends as held Government\r\ncontracts, that he had better offer at once in the expectation of an\r\nimmediate demand.\r\n\r\nTo settle such questions needed some conversation with men back from\r\nthe front, a certain knowledge of the conditions in South Africa\r\n(where, he was informed, the month of June was the depth of winter),\r\nand many another point upon which a sound decision should repose.\r\n\r\nAs he mapped out his consequent activity for the coming day, he heard\r\nthe postman opening the gate in front of his villa, and went out to\r\nintercept the daily paper which he delivered.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck tore its cover thoughtlessly enough in the expectation\r\nof discovering some minor successes or perhaps an unfortunate but\r\nnecessary surrender of men and guns, when a leaded paragraph in large\r\ntype and at the very head of the first column, struck him almost as\r\nwith a blow. With a dramatic suddenness that none save a very few in\r\nthe highest financial world could have expected, negotiations for peace\r\nhad opened and the enemy had laid down their arms.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck sat down upon the steps of his house, oblivious of the\r\ngiggling maid who was washing the stone behind him, and gazed blankly\r\nat the two Wellingtonias and the Japanese arbutus which dignified\r\nhis patch of lawn. He left the paper lying where it was, and moved\r\nmiserably into the house.\r\n\r\nDuring the meal Mrs. Clutterbuck made no more allusion to his business\r\nthan was her wont, and was especially careful to say nothing in regard\r\nto the deceased friend, whose relations with her husband she knew\r\nhad latterly been more than those of an ordinary acquaintance. She\r\ndid, however, permit herself to suggest that there must be something\r\nextraordinary in the fact that the blinds in Mr. Boyle's house were now\r\nlifted, that there had been no orders for a funeral, and that her own\r\ninvestigations among her neighbours made it more than probable that no\r\nsuch ceremony would be needed.\r\n\r\nThe candid character of her husband was slow to seize the significance\r\nof this last item, but when in the course of the forenoon a police\r\ninspector, accompanied by a less exalted member of the force,\r\nrespectfully desired an interview with him, Mr. Clutterbuck could not\r\nbut experience such emotions as men do who find themselves engulfed in\r\ndarkness by a sudden flood.\r\n\r\nHe was happy to find, after the first few moments, that it was not\r\nwith him these bulwarks of public order were concerned, but with that\r\nfaithless man whose name he had determined never again to pronounce.\r\n\r\nDid Mr. Clutterbuck know anything of Mr. Boyle's movements? When had\r\nhe last seen him? Had Mr. Boyle, to his knowledge, taken the train for\r\nCroydon as usual on the day he cashed the cheque? Had he any knowledge\r\nof Mr. Boyle's intentions? Had Mr. Boyle shown him, by accident or by\r\ndesign, a ticket for any foreign port? And if so (added the official\r\nwith the singular finesse of his profession) was that ticket made out\r\nfor Buenos Ayres?\r\n\r\nTo all of these questions Mr. Clutterbuck was happily able to give a\r\nfrank, straightforward, English answer such as satisfied his visitors.\r\nNor did he dismiss them without offering, in spite of the matutinal\r\nhour, to the more exalted one a glass of wine, to the lesser a tumbler\r\nof ale. To see them march in step out of his carriage gate was the\r\nfirst relief he had obtained that morning.\r\n\r\nHe comforted his sad heart by the very object of his sadness, as is\r\nour pathetic human way. He took a sort of mournful pride in handling\r\nthe great key that gave him access to the warehouse, and a peculiar\r\npleasure in snubbing the servant who had denied him when he had called\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThese eggs after all were a possession; they were a tangible thing,\r\na million was their number; the very boxes in which they soaked were\r\nproperty; and it cannot be denied that Mr. Clutterbuck, who had\r\nhitherto possessed no real thing nor extended his personality to any\r\nvisible objects beyond his furniture, his clothes, his pipe, his\r\nbicycle, and his wife, could not but be influenced by the sense of\r\nownership. Sometimes he would select an egg at random, and placing\r\nit in the machine which had been witness of his first decisive\r\ninterview, he would examine whether or no it were still transparent;\r\nbut the occupation was but a pastime. Often he did not really note\r\ntheir condition, and when he did note it, whether that condition were\r\nsatisfactory or no, he would replace the sample as solemnly as he had\r\nchosen it.\r\n\r\nDay after day it was Mr. Clutterbuck's mournful occupation to regard\r\nthem as they lay stilly in their brine, these eggs that had so long\r\nawaited the call to arms from South Africa; that call which never came.\r\nTo complete his despair the rumours of a full treaty of peace, which\r\nhad tortured him for a whole week, were finally confirmed. He seemed\r\nirrecoverably lost, and though a preserved egg will always fetch its\r\nprice in this country, yet the distribution of so vast a number, the\r\nsearch for a market, and the presence of such considerable competitors\r\non every side--the total length of the boxes in which the eggs were\r\nstored amounted to no less than six miles and one-third--made him\r\ndespair of recovering even one-half of the original sum which he had\r\nrisked.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck must not be blamed for an anxiety common to every man\r\nof affairs in speculations which have not yet matured: and those who,\r\nfrom a more exalted position in society, or from a more profound study\r\nof our institutions would have reposed confidence in the equity of the\r\nGovernment, must not blame the humble merchant of Croydon if in his\r\nbewilderment he misjudged for a moment the temper of a British Cabinet.\r\n\r\nThat temper did not betray him. The Government, at the close of the\r\nwar were more than just--they were bountiful to those who, in the\r\nexpectation of a prolonged conflict, had accumulated stores for the\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nNo one recognised better than the Cabinet of the day under what an\r\nobligation they lay to the mercantile world which had seen them through\r\nthe short but grave crisis in South Africa, nor did any men appreciate\r\nbetter than they the contract into which they had virtually if not\r\ntechnically entered, to recoup those whom their abrupt negotiations for\r\npeace had left in the lurch. It could not be denied that the published\r\ndespatches of Lord Milner and the frequently expressed determination of\r\nthe Government never to treat with the Dutch rebels in the Transvaal,\r\nhad led the community in general to imagine a conflict of indefinite\r\nduration. And if, for reasons which it is not my duty to criticise\r\nhere, they saw fit to reverse this policy and to put their names to a\r\nregular treaty, the least they could do for those whose patriotism had\r\naccumulated provisions to continue the struggle, was to recompense them\r\nnot only equitably but largely for their sacrifice.\r\n\r\nThe decision so to act and to repurchase, with a special generosity,\r\nthe eggs accumulated for our forces, was reinforced by many other\r\nconsiderations besides those of political equity. It was recognised\r\nthat for some time to come a considerable garrison would be necessary\r\nto constrain the terrible foe whom we had so recently vanquished; it\r\nwas recognised that of all articles of diet the egg has recently been\r\nproved the most sustaining for its weight and price; the perishable\r\nnature of the commodity, though it had been counteracted by the\r\nscientific methods of the packers, was another consideration of great\r\nweight, certain as it was that the preservation of these supplies could\r\nnot be indefinitely continued, and that the moment they were moved\r\ndissolution would be at hand; finally, the Government could not forget\r\nthat these eggs, worth but a paltry farthing apiece upon the shores of\r\nthe Baltic or in the frozen deserts of Siberia, would exchange in the\r\narid waste of the veldt for fifty times that sum.\r\n\r\nMy readers will have guessed the conclusion: in spite of the fact that\r\nthe chief packer was no less than Sir Henry Nathan, a man willing to\r\nwait, well able to do so, a continual and generous subscriber to the\r\nRelief Funds; in spite of a letter to the _Times_ signed by Baron de\r\nCzernwitz himself in the name of the larger holders, and professing\r\nevery willingness to accept bonds at 3-1/2 per cent., the condition of\r\nthe smaller men was enough to decide the Government. Within a week of\r\nthe cessation of hostilities, offers had been issued to all the owners\r\nat the rate, less carriage, of one shilling for each egg which should\r\nbe found actually present beneath the surface of the brine; for here,\r\nas in every other matter, our Government regulations are strict and\r\nminute; there was no intention of paying in the rough for a vague or\r\ncomputed number: it was necessary that every egg should be counted,\r\nand its preservation determined, before a shilling of public money\r\nshould be exchanged for it. The inspection, the cost of which fell,\r\nas was only just, upon the public purse, was rapidly and efficiently\r\naccomplished by a large body of experts chosen for the purpose, and\r\norganised under the direction of Lord Henry Townley, whose name and\r\nsalary alone are a guarantee of scientific excellence and accuracy.\r\nThus it was that a group of merchants who had in no way pressed the\r\nauthorities, who had stood the stress and strain of waiting during\r\nthose last critical days before the Treaty of Vereeniging was signed,\r\nobtained, as such men always will from our Commonwealth, the just\r\nreward of their public spirit and endurance.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck was perhaps not so fortunate as some others. Of the\r\nmillion eggs which he nominally controlled, no less than 8306 were\r\nrejected upon examination, and the bonds he received, so far from\r\namounting to a full £5000, fell short of that sum by over £415. Certain\r\nexpenses incidental to the transaction further lowered the net amount\r\npaid over, but even under these circumstances Mr. Clutterbuck was not\r\ndisappointed to receive over £4500 as his share of compensation for\r\nloss and delay.\r\n\r\nThose who are willing to see in human affairs the guiding hand of\r\nProvidence and who cannot admit into their vocabulary the meaningless\r\nexpression \"coincidence,\" will reverently note the part which an\r\nEnglish Government played in the foundation of a private fortune.\r\n\r\nElated, and (it must be admitted) rendered a little wayward in judgment\r\nby this accession of wealth, Mr. Clutterbuck was more deeply convinced\r\nof advancing prosperity when the rise of Government credit during\r\nthe next weeks still further increased the value of the bonds which\r\nhis bank held for him. He sold in July, and with the sum he realised\r\nentered upon yet another venture, which must be briefly reviewed. Upon\r\nthe advice of an old and dear friend he purchased no less than 72,000\r\nshares in the discredited property of the Curicanti Docks. The one\r\npound shares of that unhappy concern had fallen steadily since 1897,\r\nwhen the whaling station had been removed to Dolores; but even here,\r\nimprudent as the speculation may appear, his good fortune followed him.\r\n\r\nThe friend whose advice Mr. Clutterbuck had followed--a private\r\ngentleman--had himself long held shares in the property of that\r\ndistant port; its continued misfortune had raised in him such doubts\r\nas to its future that he thought it better a solid brain such as Mr.\r\nClutterbuck's should help to direct its fortunes, than that he and\r\nothers like him should be at the loss of their small capital. He\r\narranged with an intermediary for the sale of the shares should Mr.\r\nClutterbuck desire to purchase in the open market, and was relieved\r\nbeyond measure to find his advice followed and Mr. Clutterbuck\r\nin possession of the whole parcel at one and a penny each. To\r\nthe astonishment, however, of the friend, and still more of the\r\nintermediary whom that friend had employed, the difficulties of the\r\nCuricanti Docks were in the very next month submitted to arbitration; a\r\nman of Cabinet rank, whose name I honour too much to mention here, was\r\nappointed arbitrator. The help of the Imperial Government was afforded\r\nto re-establish a concern whose failings were purely commercial, but\r\nwhose strategic importance to the Empire it needs but a glance at the\r\nmap to perceive. The shares which had dropped some days after Mr.\r\nClutterbuck's purchase to between ninepence ha'pennny and ninepence\r\nthree farthings, rose at once upon the news of this Imperial Decision\r\nto half a crown. The negotiations were conducted by that tried\r\nstatesman with so much skill and integrity that, before September, the\r\nsame shares were at eight and fourpence, and though the commercial\r\ntransactions of the port and the grant of Government money upon the\r\nAdmiralty vote did not warrant the public excitement in this particular\r\nform of investment, it was confidently prophesied they would go to par.\r\nThey did not do so, but when they had reached, and were passing, ten\r\nshillings Mr. Clutterbuck sold.\r\n\r\nHe had not intended to dispose of them at so early a date, for he\r\nwas confident, as was the rest of the public, that they would go to\r\npar. His action, due to a sudden accession of nervousness and to a\r\ncontemplation of the large profit already acquired, turned out, however\r\n(as is so often the case with the sudden decisions of men with business\r\ninstinct!) profoundly just. In one transaction, indeed, a few days\r\nlater, Curicantis were quoted at ten shillings and sixpence, but it is\r\nnot certain that they really changed hands at that price, and certainly\r\nthey went no higher.[1]\r\n\r\nAs the autumn thus turned to winter, Mr. Clutterbuck found himself\r\npossessed, somewhat to his bewilderment and greatly to the increase of\r\nhis manhood, of over £50,000.\r\n\r\nIt has often been remarked by men of original genius as they look back\r\nin old age upon their careers, that some one turning point of fortune\r\nestablished in them a trust in themselves and determined the future\r\nconduct of their minds, strengthening all that was in them and almost\r\ncompelling them to the highest achievement. In that autumn this turning\r\npoint had come for Mr. Clutterbuck.\r\n\r\nThere were subtle signs of change about the man: he would come home\r\nearlier than usual; the four o'clock train in which the great Princes\r\nof Commerce are so often accommodated would receive him from time to\r\ntime; there were whole Saturdays on which he did not leave for the\r\nCity at all. He was kinder to his wife and less careful whether he\r\nwere shaved or no before ten o'clock in the morning. Other papers than\r\nthe _Times_ found entry to his villa: he was open to discuss political\r\nmatters with a broad mind, and had more than once before the year was\r\nended read articles in the _Daily Chronicle_ and the _Westminster\r\nGazette_. He had also attended not a few profane concerts, and had\r\nbought, at the recommendation of a local dealer, six etchings, one\r\nafter Whistler, the other five original.\r\n\r\nBut, such is the effect of fortune upon wise and balanced men, he did\r\nnot immediately proceed to use his greatly increased financial power\r\nin the way of further speculation; he retained his old offices, he\r\ninvested, sold, and reinvested upon a larger scale indeed than he\r\nhad originally been accustomed to, but much in the same manner. A\r\ncheeriness developed in his manner towards his dependents, notably\r\ntowards his clerk and towards the office boy, a staff which he saw no\r\nreason to increase. He would speak to them genially of their affairs\r\nat home, and when he had occasion to reprimand or mulct them, a thing\r\nwhich in earlier days he had never thought of doing, it was always\r\nin a sympathetic tone that he administered the rebuke or exacted the\r\npecuniary penalty.\r\n\r\nIt was long debated between himself and his wife whether or no they\r\nshould set up a brougham; and Mrs. Clutterbuck, having pointed out the\r\nexpense of this method of conveyance, herself decided upon a small\r\nelectric landaulette, which, as she very well pointed out, though of\r\na heavier initial cost, would be less expensive to maintain, less\r\ncapricious in its action, and of a further range. She argued with\r\ngreat facility that in case of any interruption in train service, or\r\nin the sad event of her own demise, it would still be useful for\r\nconveying her husband to and from the City; and Mr. Clutterbuck having\r\npointed out the many disadvantages attaching to this form of traction,\r\npurchased the vehicle, only refusing, I am glad to say, with inflexible\r\ndetermination, to have painted upon its panels the crest of the\r\nMontagues.\r\n\r\nNo extra servants were added to the household; but in the matter of\r\ndress there was a certain largeness; the cook was trained at some\r\nexpense to present dishes which Mr. Clutterbuck had hitherto only\r\nenjoyed at the Palmerston Restaurant in Broad Street; and the bicycle,\r\nwhich was now no longer of service, was given open-handedly to the\r\ngardener who had hitherto only used it by permission.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with this increase of fortune, Mr. Clutterbuck acquired\r\na clean and decisive way of speaking, prefaced most commonly by a\r\nlittle period of thought, and he permitted himself certain minor\r\nluxuries to which he had hitherto been unaccustomed: he would buy\r\ncigars singly at the tobacconist's; he used credit in the matter of\r\nwine, that is, of sherry and of port, and his hat was often ironed when\r\nhe was shaved.\r\n\r\nIt must not be imagined, however, that these new luxuries gravely\r\ninterfered with the general tenor of his life. His wife perceived,\r\nindeed, that something was easier in their fortunes, that the cash\r\nnecessary for her good deeds (and this was never extravagant) was\r\nalways present and was given without grudging. His ample and ready\r\nmanner impressed his neighbours with some advance in life. But nothing\r\nvery greatly changed about him. He lived in the same house, with the\r\nsame staff of servants; he entertained no more at home, for he was\r\nshy of meeting new friends, and but little more in the City, where\r\nalso his acquaintance was restricted. This wise demeanour resulted in\r\na continual accumulation, for it is not difficult in a man of this\r\nsubstance to buy and sell with prudence upon the smaller scale. Mr.\r\nClutterbuck for five years continued a sensible examination of markets,\r\nbuying what was obviously cheap, selling what even the mentally\r\ndeficient could perceive to be dear, and though he missed, or rather\r\ndid not attempt, many considerable opportunities (among which should\r\nhonourably be mentioned Hudson Bays, and the rise in the autumn of 1907\r\nof the London and North Western Railway shares),[2] the general trend\r\nof his judgment was accurate. For two years he maintained a slight but\r\nsufficient growth in his capital, and he entered what was to prove a\r\nnew phase of his life in the year 1910 with a property, not merely upon\r\npaper, but in rapidly negotiable securities, of over £60,000, a solid\r\noutlook on the world, and a knowledge of the market which, while it did\r\nnot pretend to subtle or occult relations with the heads of finance,\r\nstill less to an exalted view of European politics, was minute and\r\nexperienced.\r\n\r\nIt was under these conditions that such an increment of wealth came\r\nto him as only befalls men who have earned the apparent accident of\r\nfortune by permanent and uncompromising labour.\r\n\r\nIn the April of that momentous year 1910, Mr. Clutterbuck suddenly\r\nachieved a financial position of such eminence as those who have\r\nnot toiled and thought and planned are too often tempted to believe\r\nfortuitous.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The present price of sixpence a share is, in the opinion\r\nof the author, merely nominal, and any one with a few pounds to spare\r\nwould do well to buy, for further Government action in connection with\r\nthe docks has been rendered inevitable by the necessity of admitting\r\nnew ships of the _Dreadnought_ type for repair to plates after firing.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: After the fruitful interference of the Board of Trade.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was certain, as the month of April 1910 proceeded, that a demand\r\nwould suddenly be made upon English capital for the exploitation of the\r\nManatasara Syndicate's concession upon the Upper Congo.\r\n\r\nI mention the matter only to elucidate what follows, for Mr.\r\nClutterbuck was neither of the social rank nor of the literary world in\r\nwhich the salvation of the unhappy natives of the Congo had been the\r\nprincipal theme for months and years before.\r\n\r\nThat salvation had been only recently achieved, but the hideous rule of\r\nLeopold no longer weighed upon the innocent and unfortunate cannibals\r\nof equatorial Africa; dawn had broken at last upon those millions whom\r\nChrist died to save, and whom so many missionaries had undertaken\r\nhasty and expensive voyages to free from an exploitation odious to the\r\nprinciples of our Common Law.\r\n\r\nBut though the consummation of that great event, which history will\r\nalways record as the chief achievement of modern England, was but\r\nfreshly written upon the tablets of our age, there were not a few in\r\nthe financial and ecclesiastical world of London who could read the\r\nsigns of the times, and could appreciate the material results which\r\nwould follow upon the advent of Christian liberty for these unhappy\r\nmen. I have but to mention Sir Joseph Gorley, the Right Rev. the Lord\r\nBishop of Shoreham, Sir Harry Hog, Mrs. Entwistle, Lord Barry, the\r\nDean of Betchworth, Lord Blackwater, and his second son, the Hon. I.\r\nBenzinger, to show the stuff of which the reformers were composed.\r\n\r\nThere were some, indeed, to whom the financial necessities of the\r\nunhappy natives were but a second consideration, absorbed as they were\r\nin the spiritual needs of the African; but there were others who saw,\r\nwith the sturdy common sense which has led us to all our victories,\r\nthat little could be done even upon the spiritual side, until marshes\r\nhad been drained, forests cleared, fields ploughed, and the most\r\ncarefully chosen implements imported from as carefully chosen merchants\r\nin the capitals of Europe. The directing hand and brain of the European\r\nmust be lent to raise the material position of those unhappy savages in\r\nwhom the Belgian had almost obliterated the semblance of humanity.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose had been chosen, after long thought by those best\r\nacquainted with the district, Mr. Charles Hatton, brother of that\r\nMr. Sachs whose name will be familiar to all as the originator of the\r\nSociety for the Prevention of the Trade in Tobacco to the Inhabitants\r\nof Liberia, and the successful manager of Chutes Limited.\r\n\r\nMr. Hatton, who, upon his marriage with Amelia, daughter and heiress of\r\nSir Henry Hatton, of Hatton Hall, Hatton, in Herefordshire, had adopted\r\nhis father-in-law's name and had lent the whole of his considerable\r\nfortune, and of his yet more considerable talents, to the uplifting\r\nof the equatorial negro. Mr. Hatton it was who successfully carried\r\nthrough the negotiations with the Colonial Committee of the Belgian\r\nParliament, and who obtained for his syndicate the concession of the\r\nManatasara district for twenty-one years.\r\n\r\nThe first act of the concessionaires was to take advantage of the new\r\nregulations whereby future chartered rulers in the Congo might declare\r\nthe native to be the owner of his land. The soil to which these poor\r\nblacks were born was restored to them. The hideous system of forced\r\nlabour was at once ended, and in its place one uniform hut tax was\r\nimposed upon the whole community. All were free, and though the actual\r\namount of labour required to discharge the tax was perhaps triple\r\nthe old assessment, yet as it fell equally upon the whole tribe, no\r\ncomplaint of injustice could be made, nor, to judge from the absence\r\nof complaint in the London papers, was any felt.\r\n\r\nIn many other ways the new _régime_ witnessed to the great truth that\r\nbusiness and righteousness are not opposed in the Dark Continent. Where\r\nthe native had been permitted to run free at every risk to his morals\r\nand to ours, he was now segregated in neat compounds under a tutelage\r\nsuitable to his stage of development. The early marriages at which\r\nthe fatuous Continental friars had winked, were severely repressed.\r\nThe adoption of Christianity in any of its forms (except Mormonism),\r\nwas left to the free exercise of individual choice, but the pestilent\r\nfolly of ordaining native priests was at once forbidden. Most important\r\nof all, the abominable restriction of human liberty by which, under\r\nthe accursed rule of King Leopold the native's very food and drink\r\nhad been supervised, was replaced by an ample liberty in which he was\r\nfree to accept or to reject the beverages of civilisation. The natural\r\ntemptation which gin at a penny the bottle offers to a primitive being\r\nwas not met as of old by slavish prohibition, but by the wiser and\r\nmore noble engine of persuasion, and the temperance leagues already\r\nspringing up in the coast towns, gave promise of deep effect upon the\r\ngeneral tone of the native community.\r\n\r\nTo all this beneficent endeavour, capital alone was lacking. To look\r\nfor it in the hardened and worldly centres of the continent was\r\nhopeless. Those who in our own country would some years ago have\r\nbeen the first to come forward, had recently so suffered through the\r\nnecessary initial expense of Rhode's glorious dream, that with all the\r\ngood will in the world they hesitated to embark upon novel ventures in\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nMore than one godly woman, persuaded by the eloquence of those who had\r\nheard of the atrocities, was willing to venture her few hundreds; and\r\nmore than one wealthy manufacturer bestowed considerable donations of\r\nfifty pounds and more upon the spiritual side of the new enterprise:\r\none high spirit of fire endowed a bishopric with £300 a year for\r\nthree years. But the attempt to float a company upon the basis of the\r\nconcession was still in jeopardy, and it seemed for a moment as though\r\nall those years of effort to destroy the infamy of Leopold's control\r\nhad been thrown away.\r\n\r\nThe concessionaires, eager as they were to work in the vineyard, could\r\nhardly be expected to go forward until the general public should\r\ntake something of the burden off their hands. It was under these\r\ncircumstances that the Manatasara Syndicate and its offspring the\r\ncompany stood in the spring of 1910.\r\n\r\nPut in terms of Eternal Life, the shares in the new company of the\r\nManatasara Syndicate which was to uplift so many poor negroes and to\r\nfree so many human souls, were more precious than pearl or ruby and\r\nabove the price of chrysoprase,[3] but in the cold terms of our mortal\r\nmarkets this month of April found them utterly unsaleable. Yet the\r\ncapital required was small, one considerable purchase would have been\r\nenough to start the sluggish stream; and if it be asked why, under\r\nthese circumstances, Mr. Hatton did not use his considerable financial\r\ninfluence to obtain the first subscriptions, the answer is that he\r\nwas far too high-minded to persuade any man, even for the noblest of\r\nideals, to the smallest risk for which he might later seem responsible.\r\nAs to his own means, ardent as was his enthusiasm for the cause of our\r\nblack brothers, he owed it to his wife, to his bright-eyed boy, and\r\nto his aged father-in-law, Sir Charles Hatton of Hatton Hall, who was\r\npenniless, to risk no portion of the family fortune in any speculation\r\nno matter how deserving.\r\n\r\nThe public, though their ears were ringing with the name of Manatasara,\r\nand though the Press spoke of little else, held back; there was an\r\ninterval--a very short one--during which the reconstruction of the\r\nwhole affair was seriously considered in secret, when the Hand which\r\nwill so often be observed in these pages, visibly moved for the\r\nbenediction of Mr. Clutterbuck and of the great Empire which he was\r\ndestined to serve.\r\n\r\nThe Municipal Council of Monte Zarro, in southern Italy, had in\r\nthat same spring of 1910 determined upon the construction of new\r\nwater-works; and in the true spirit of the men who inherit from\r\nGaribaldi, from Crispi, and from Nathan,[4] they had put the contract\r\nup to the highest--or rather, to the most efficient--tender. I need\r\nhardly say that the firm of Bigglesworth, of Tyneside, the Minories,\r\nand Pall Mall East, obtained the contract; a firm intimately connected\r\nboth with the Foreign Office and with the Cavaliere Marlio, and one\r\nwhose name is synonymous with thorough if expensive workmanship. The\r\nbonds to be issued in connection with this progressive enterprise\r\nwere to bear an interest of four and a half per cent., and in view\r\nof the comparative poverty of the town and the extensive nature of\r\nthe investment (which was designed for a town of at least 50,000\r\ninhabitants, though Monte Zarro numbered no more than 15,000), in view\r\nalso of the high cost of municipal action in Italy, was to be issued\r\nat some low figure; the precise price was conveyed privately to a few\r\nsubstantial clients of Barnett and Sons' Bank who all precipitately\r\nrefused to touch the security: all, that is, with the exception of Mr.\r\nClutterbuck.\r\n\r\nHe, with the unerring instinct that had now guided him for nearly eight\r\nlong years, decided to take up the issue. It was not until he had twice\r\ndined, and generously, with a junior partner of the bank that he was\r\nfinally persuaded to support the scheme with his capital, nor did his\r\nloyal nature suspect the bias that others were too ready to impute to\r\nthe banker's recommendation.\r\n\r\nIndeed, Mr. Clutterbuck was led to this determination not so much by\r\nthe extremely low price at which the bonds were offered him, or the\r\nconsiderable interest they were pledged to bear, as by the implied and,\r\nas it were, necessary guarantee of the Italian Government which Barnett\r\nand Sons assured him were behind them. Of the two things, as the junior\r\npartner was careful to point out, one must occur: either the interest\r\nupon the outlay would be too much for the Municipality, in which case\r\nthe Government would be bound to intervene, or the interest would be\r\nregularly paid, at least for the first few years, in which case the\r\nprice of eighty-three at which the bonds were offered was surely so low\r\nas to ensure an immediately profitable sale.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck was in no haste, however; the issue still had some\r\ndays before it, he was still considering what precise sum he was\r\nprepared to furnish, when he felt, during one of the later and more\r\nbitter mornings of that April, an unaccountable weakness and fever\r\nwhich increased as the day proceeded.\r\n\r\nHe at once consulted an eminent physician of his recent acquaintance,\r\nand was assured by the Baronet that if he were not suffering from the\r\nfirst stages of influenza, he was either the victim of a feverish cold\r\nor possibly of overwork.\r\n\r\nThis grave news determined him, as a prudent man, to leave his business\r\nfor some days and to take a sea voyage, but before doing so, with equal\r\nprudence he put a power of attorney into the hands of a confidential\r\nclerk and left witnessed instructions upon the important investment\r\nwhich would have to be made in his absence.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, or rather fortunately--such are the mysterious designs\r\nof Heaven--he dictated these full and minute instructions which he\r\nwas to leave behind him, and in the increasing discomfort which he\r\nfelt toward evening, he neglected to read over the typewritten copy\r\npresented him to sign.\r\n\r\nThat evening at Croydon, the symptoms being now more pronounced, it was\r\npatent even to the suburban doctor that Mr. Clutterbuck was the prey\r\nof a Diplococcus, not improbably the hideous Diplococcus of pneumonia.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe confidential clerk heard with regret next morning by telephone of\r\nthe misadventure that had befallen his master; but he was a man of\r\nwell-founded confidence in himself; he had now for five years past\r\nconducted the major part of Mr. Clutterbuck's affairs, under his\r\nsuperior's immediate direction, it is true, and his proficiency had\r\nearned him a high and increasing salary. Save for an active anxiety\r\nas to Mr. Clutterbuck's ultimate recovery, the terms of his will, and\r\nother matters naturally falling within his province, he knew that he\r\nhad all the instructions and powers upon which to act during the next\r\nfew days.\r\n\r\nHe spent the first of those days in visiting, in company with his\r\nsecond cousin Hyacinth, the charming old town of Rye; the second,\r\nwhich was also the first of Mr. Clutterbuck's delirium, he occupied in\r\nperusing and digesting at length the detailed instructions which had\r\nbeen left in his hands.\r\n\r\nWith the fact that a large investment must of necessity be made in\r\na few days he was already familiar: his master had sold out and had\r\nplaced to his current account at Parr's the important sum destined to\r\nmeet it. But he was necessarily in ignorance of the precise security\r\nin which that sum was to be placed, for Mr. Clutterbuck had come to his\r\nfinal determination but a little while before his illness had struck\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe instructions would, he knew, contain his orders in every\r\nparticular, and it was mainly with the object of discovering what he\r\nwas to do in this chief matter that he studied the lines before him.\r\n\r\nThe directions given covered a multitude of points; they concerned the\r\nbuying and selling of a certain number of small stocks, especially the\r\nrealisation of certain Siberian Copper shares, which still stood high,\r\nbut which Mr. Clutterbuck, having heard upon the best authority that\r\nthe copper was entirely exhausted, had determined to convey to some\r\nother gentleman before the general public should acquire, through the\r\nPress, information which he had obtained at no small expense in advance\r\nof the correspondents.\r\n\r\nThere followed several paragraphs relative to the installation of\r\ncertain improvements in the office, upon which Mr. Clutterbuck was\r\ncuriously eager; next, in quite a brief but equally clear passage,\r\nwas the order--if the merchant were not himself able to attend to the\r\nmatter by the 25th at latest--to take up 15,000 shares in the Muntsar\r\nissue; an investment, the instructions added, on which the fullest\r\nparticulars would be afforded him, if he were in any doubt, by Messrs.\r\nBarnett and Sons.\r\n\r\nThe Confidential Clerk was in very considerable doubt. The word as it\r\nstood was meaningless. He sent for Miss Pugh, the shorthand writer, and\r\nher notes; they appeared together with hauteur, and the Confidential\r\nClerk, who in humbler days had done his 120 words a minute, carefully\r\nexamined the outline. It was not very neat, but there was the \"Mntsor\"\r\nright enough. He complained of the vowels, and received from Miss Pugh,\r\nwhom he openly admired, so sharp a reprimand as silenced him.... Yet\r\nhis experience assured him that \"Mnt\" was not an English form. He began\r\nto experiment with the vowels. He tried \"e\" and \"a\" and made Muntusare,\r\nwhich was nonsense; then he tried \"a\" and \"u\"; then \"a\" and \"e\"; and\r\nsuddenly he saw it.\r\n\r\nIn a flash he remembered a friend of his who was employed in the\r\noffices of a syndicate; he should surely have guessed! Manatasara!\r\n\r\nMore than once that friend had hinted at the advantage of \"setting\r\nthe ball rolling.\" More than once had he spoken in flattery of the\r\nConfidential Clerk's ascendency over his master and with unmerited\r\ncontempt of that master's initiative.... He had even let it be known\r\nthat the introduction of Mr. Clutterbuck's name alone would be regarded\r\nwith substantial gratitude by Mr. Hatton.... The more he thought of\r\nit the more he was determined that Manatasara was the word ... and he\r\nneeded no help from Barnett and Sons now.\r\n\r\nHe considered the habits of his friend, and remembered that he commonly\r\nlunched at the Woolpack. To the Woolpack went the Confidential Clerk\r\na little after two, and found that friend making a book with Natty\r\nTimpson, Joe Buller, and the rest upon the approaching but most\r\nuncertain Derby. He joined them, drew him aside, briefly told him his\r\nbusiness, and asked him how he should proceed.\r\n\r\nHis friend, who was a true friend and a little drunk, conveyed to\r\nhim, in language which would certainly be tedious here and probably\r\noffensive, the extreme pleasure his principals would find in Mr.\r\nClutterbuck's determination: the probability that the Confidential\r\nClerk himself would not go unrewarded. He spoke of his own high hopes;\r\nthen, as he contemplated the opportunity in all its greatness, it so\r\nworked upon his own enthusiasm as to make him insist upon accompanying\r\nthe reluctant Clerk to the office itself, and introducing him in a\r\nflushed but articulate manner to Mr. Hatton's private secretary.\r\n\r\nThe two were closeted together for something less than an hour; it was\r\nnot four o'clock when they parted. Mr. Hatton's secretary, forgetting\r\nall social distinctions, shook hands warmly at the door with the\r\nConfidential Clerk, who passed out heedless of his friend's eager\r\npantomime in the outer office. And thus it was that by the morning of\r\nthe next day, while poor Mr. Clutterbuck's temperature was hovering\r\nround 104° (Fahrenheit), no small portion of his goods were already\r\nearmarked for the Great Crusade to Redeem the Negro Race.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck's illness reached its crisis and passed; but for many\r\ndays he was not allowed to hear the least news, still less to occupy\r\nhimself with business. The Confidential Clerk was far too careful of\r\nhis master's interests to jeopardise them by too early a call upon his\r\nenergies. He wrote a daily report to Mrs. Clutterbuck to the effect\r\nthat nothing had been done beyond the written instructions left by her\r\nhusband, that all was well, and the office in perfect order. He was\r\nat the pains of dictating a daily synopsis of the correspondence he\r\nhad opened and answered; and though the offer of marriage which since\r\nhis new stroke of fortune he had made to Miss Pugh for the second time\r\nhad for the second time been rejected, he continued to utilise her\r\nservices, both on his own account and on that of his absent principal.\r\n\r\nHe dictated considerable reports upon the movements of his favourite\r\nstocks to greet Mr. Clutterbuck's eye upon his recovery, and in a\r\nhundred ways gave evidence of his discretion and his zeal now that he\r\ncould look forward to his master's early return.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Barnett and Sons, after assuring themselves by certain\r\ngeneral questions that Mr. Clutterbuck had said nothing with regard to\r\nany Italian investment, held the parcel over till it could be dealt\r\nwith in person, and were satisfied of the tenacity of purpose of their\r\nclient.\r\n\r\nIn the first week of May Mr. Clutterbuck, his crescent of a moustache\r\nuntrimmed, his hair quite grey, but the broad fan of it still clinging\r\nto his large, bald forehead, was permitted for the first time after so\r\nmany days to see the papers and hear news of the world.\r\n\r\nHe was languid and utterly indifferent, as convalescents are, to what\r\nhad hitherto been his chief interests, but as a matter of wifely duty\r\nMrs. Clutterbuck felt herself bound to read him at full length the\r\nCity article in the _Times_, and as she did so on the third day her\r\nphilanthropic and evangelising eye was caught, in the midst of names\r\nthat had no meaning for her, by the one name Manatasara. It was the\r\nfeature of the moment that the new company had been successfully\r\nlaunched.\r\n\r\nA strong Imperialist, like most women of the governing classes and of\r\nthe Established Faith, whether in this country or in Scotland, she\r\nnaturally rejoiced to observe securely forged yet another bond with the\r\nBritains Overseas. She could comprehend little of the technicalities\r\nof promotion, but she was aware that another of these achievements, of\r\nwhich the Chartered Company of South Africa had for so many years been\r\nthe brilliant type, was upon the eve of its success, and she rejoiced\r\nwith a joy in which the love of country stood side by side with a pure\r\nand sincere attachment to her religion.\r\n\r\nAs one day of convalescence succeeded to another, this item of news\r\nbegan to grow so insistent that the wan invalid could not but take some\r\nheed of it. Although the long list of shares and prices recited like\r\na litany had carried with it, when it had approached him through his\r\nwife's lips, something more than tedium, yet when he was permitted to\r\nread and select in it for himself and with his own eyes, the prominence\r\ngiven to Manatasara's interwove with his reviving interest in life the\r\nstory of Charles Hatton's creation.\r\n\r\nThe capital was not large: the district was but one of many, but the\r\nstrong interest which the place had aroused and the very restriction in\r\nthe number of available shares had roused the public.\r\n\r\nThe allotment had been followed by a sharp rise. There were dealings\r\nin the new quotation so continual and so vigorous as to recall the\r\ngreat days before the South African War. The premium upon \"Congoes,\" as\r\nthey were affectionately called, rose without ceasing--and just at the\r\nmoment when Mr. Clutterbuck was beginning, but only beginning, to grasp\r\nthe story of the company, he was permitted, somewhat doubtfully, by his\r\ndoctor to return for an hour or two to the City.\r\n\r\nHe reached his office, where a warm and cordial welcome awaited him;\r\nhis correspondence had already been opened, and an abstract made by\r\nhis Clerk and Secretary, when, before he had fully mastered what had\r\nhappened, that admirable assistant remarked to him in a tone more\r\ndeferential than he had expected, that he had received full allotment\r\nfor his application in consideration of the very early date on which he\r\napproached the Syndicate.\r\n\r\n\"What allotment?\" said the enfeebled Mr. Clutterbuck, as he looked up\r\nin some astonishment from the paper before him.\r\n\r\n\"The allotment in Congoes, sir. I understood I was to apply. I kept the\r\nmoney ready, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've paid nothing I hope,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck in a testy voice too\r\noften associated with convalescents. \"You haven't been such a fool as\r\nto pay anything on your own?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir----\" said the Clerk hesitatingly. Then he waited for a\r\nmoment for the full effect of his good fortune to penetrate Mr.\r\nClutterbuck's renewed conceptions of the outer world.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck read the letter before him twice over, slowly. He\r\nhad received allotment to the full amount; the call had been for a\r\nhalf-crown on 60,000. He did not appreciate how he stood. His mind,\r\nalways rather sane than alert, was enfeebled by illness and long\r\nabsence from affairs.\r\n\r\n\"You've been doing something silly,\" he said again peevishly,\r\n\"something damned silly. I don't understand. I'll repudiate it. I don't\r\nunderstand what you've done--I don't believe it's meant for me at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I humbly did my best, sir; I was assured, really and truly, that a\r\nquarter was the most they'd allow, sir; I truly believed I wasn't\r\nrisking more than 15,000 of yours, sir; I did truly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! do be quiet,\" said his principal, as he turned again to the\r\nletter. His head hurt him, and he had a buzzing in the ears. He felt he\r\nwasn't fit for all this. It was a cruel injustice to a man barely on\r\nhis feet after a glimpse of the grave.\r\n\r\nThe Clerk had the wisdom to hold his tongue and to wait. And as he\r\nwaited it dawned upon Mr. Clutterbuck that he held 60,000 Congoes; the\r\nCongoes he had heard talked of in the train; the Congoes of which\r\nthe papers had been full during the long listless days when he had\r\nlain beside his window looking out into the little sunlit garden; the\r\nCongoes with which every feature of the repeated view from that window\r\nhad become grotesquely associated in his invalid imagination. He was\r\njust about to speak again, perhaps to say the something which his Clerk\r\nmost dreaded, when he was swamped by a realisation of what had happened.\r\n\r\nWhat Mr. Clutterbuck in health would have seen in five or ten minutes,\r\nMr. Clutterbuck in convalescence at last grasped, at least as to its\r\nmain lines. He remembered two men in the train as he went in, and their\r\nangry discussion: how one who pooh-poohed the whole affair and said\r\nthey would not go beyond three before next settling day; and the other,\r\nwho was equally confident, swore that they could not fail to pass five\r\nand might touch seven. At the lowest the paper ready to his hands was\r\n60,000 of those same.\r\n\r\nHe deliberately settled his face and said to the Clerk in an impassive\r\nand altered tone:\r\n\r\n\"Have you heard what people are offering?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, it's all talk so far,\" answered the Clerk. \"Some were\r\nsaying two and a half, and I heard one gentleman say two and\r\nfive-eighths; but it's all talk, sir.\"\r\n\r\nHe watched his master narrowly, standing a little behind him and\r\nscrutinising his face as he bent over the letter and read its short\r\ncontents for the fourth time. He was well content with the result of\r\nthat scrutiny.\r\n\r\nAs for Mr. Clutterbuck, he now perceived quite clearly (and was\r\nastonished to discern his own quiet acquiescence in the discovery)\r\nthat he was at that moment--by some accident which mystified him--the\r\npossessor of over £200,000 in one department of his investments alone.\r\nHe sighed profoundly, and said in something like his old voice:\r\n\r\n\"I supposed they've had their cheque?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, undoubtedly,\" said the clerk rapidly.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck called for the cheque-book on Parr's, casually asked\r\nthe balance, turned to the counterfoil and, initialled the £7500\r\nsacrifice, he rose from the table a man worth a quarter of a million\r\nall told.\r\n\r\nThe air was warmer with the advent of summer. It was a pleasant day,\r\nand Mr. Clutterbuck, throwing open the window and letting in the roar\r\nof the sunlit street, leant for awhile looking out and taking deep\r\ndraughts of air. He noted all manner of little things, the play of the\r\nnewsboys, the ribbons upon the dray horses, the chance encounters of\r\npassers-by, and the swirl and the eddy of men. Then he drew in again,\r\nmore composed, and said to the clerk:\r\n\r\n\"Well, I suppose there's nothing more to be done to-day.\" Then it\r\noccurred to him to add: \"If any one comes round from Barnett's, tell\r\n'em 'certainly.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly what, sir?\" said the clerk. They had been round more than\r\nonce, and lately a little anxiously, but he did not like to trouble Mr.\r\nClutterbuck at that moment with such details.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" said that gentleman with a touch of his invalid's testiness\r\nreturning, \"tell 'em I'm ready to do what they want. I promised them\r\nsomething before--before my illness. Tell them 'certainly.' Tell them\r\nI'll be here again to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nThe clerk helped him on with his heavy fur coat and saw him carefully\r\nto the carriage he had hired. He urged him to drive back the whole way.\r\nBut Mr. Clutterbuck shook his head, and drove to the station. He would\r\nsoon be well again.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon, just after hours, another anxious message came from\r\nBarnett's, but this time they were satisfied. Mr. Clutterbuck was\r\nentirely at their service; he would be at the office next day.\r\n\r\nThis revolution--for it was no less--acted like a tonic upon the man\r\ninto whose life it had come. His health was restored to him with a\r\nrapidity which the doctor, who had repeatedly urged him to seek a\r\nparticular hotel upon the English Riviera, marvelled at and frequently\r\ndenied. There is no better food for a man's recovery than the food of\r\nhis vigorous manhood, and this, with Mr. Clutterbuck, was the food of\r\naffairs. To venture, to perceive before another, to seize the spoil, is\r\nlife to men of his kind; and he could now recognise in himself one of\r\nthose whose foresight and lightning action win the great prizes of this\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nHe was at his office every day, first for a short spell only, but\r\nsoon for the old full working hours; and in the midst of twenty other\r\ninterests which were rather recreations than labours, he watched\r\nCongoes. In the eagerness of that watch he neglected all the marvels\r\nthe newspapers had to tell him of an energy that was transforming the\r\nold hell of the equator into a paradise. He even neglected the great\r\nspiritual work which Dr. Perry and his assistant clergy had so manfully\r\nbegun. It must honestly be confessed that he watched nothing but the\r\nfluctuation of the Company's shares.\r\n\r\nMrs. Clutterbuck went to the seaside without him. He saw them touch\r\nseven in the heat of the summer; he was confident they would go\r\nfurther. They fell to six before the opening of August, to five a week\r\nlater. His sound commercial instinct bade him beware; at four and a\r\nhalf he sold. Then and then only did he take his long holiday away\r\nfrom the strain of business; a holiday marred to some extent by the\r\nobservation that the moment he had disposed of them Congoes rose like\r\na balloon to a point still higher than that at which he might himself\r\nmuch earlier have realised.\r\n\r\nBut though this secret thorn remained in his own side, to the world he\r\nwas a marvel; first Croydon talked of him, then the City, then Mayfair,\r\nand the sportsmen, and even the politicians. In ever-increasing\r\ncircles, at greater and greater distances from himself, fantastically\r\nexaggerated even in his own immediate neighbourhood and growing to be\r\na legend in the mouths of great ladies, the story of his one fortune,\r\namong the others of that flotation, expanded into fame.\r\n\r\nThe story rose beneath him like a tide; it floated him out of his\r\nsuburb into a new and a greater world; it floated him at last into\r\nthe majestic councils of the nation. It all but bestowed upon him an\r\nimperishable name among the Statesmen of England.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Habakkuk xvi. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The sometime Mayor of Rome; not to be confounded with Sir\r\nHenry Nathan, whom we recently came across in the matter of the eggs.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nDeep in the Surrey hills, and long secluded from the world, there runs\r\na drowsy valley known to the rustics whom it nurtures as the Vale of\r\nCaterham.\r\n\r\nOf late years our English passion for the countryside has discovered\r\nthis enchanted spot; a railway has conveyed to it those who were\r\nwise enough to seize early upon its subtle beauties, and the happy\r\nhomes of a population freed from urban care are still to be seen\r\nrising upon every sward. Here Purley, which stands at the mouth of\r\nthe Vale, Kenley, Warlingham and Caterham Stations receive at morning\r\nand discharge at evening the humbler breadwinners whom economic\r\ncircumstance compels to absent themselves from the haunting woods of\r\nSurrey during the labours of the day. Some few, more blest, in mansions\r\nmore magnificent, can contemplate throughout untroubled hours the\r\nsolemn prospect of the hills.\r\n\r\nHere it was that Mr. Clutterbuck was building the new home.\r\n\r\nThe sense of proportion which had always marked his life and had\r\ncontributed so largely to his financial success, was apparent upon\r\nevery side. He was content with some seven acres of ground, chosen in\r\nthe deepest recess of the dale, and, since water is rare upon that\r\nchalk, he was content with but a small lake of graceful outline, and of\r\nno more than eighteen inches in depth; in the midst an island, destined\r\nwith time to bear a clump of exotic trees, stood for the moment a bare\r\nheap of whitish earth diversified rather than hidden by a few leafless\r\nsaplings.\r\n\r\nThe house itself had been raised with businesslike rapidity under the\r\ndirections of Mrs. Clutterbuck herself, who had the wisdom to employ\r\nin all but the smallest details, an architect recommended by the Rev.\r\nIsaac Fowle.\r\n\r\nThe whole was in the taste which the sound domestic sense of modern\r\nEngland has substituted for the gloomy stucco and false Italian loggias\r\nof our fathers. The first storey was of red brick which time would\r\nmellow to a glorious and harmonious colour; the second was covered\r\nwith roughcast, while the third and fourth appeared as dormer windows\r\nin an ample roof containing no less than fifteen gables. The chimneys\r\nwere astonishingly perfect examples of Somersetshire heading, and\r\nthe woodwork, which was applied in thin strips outside the main\r\nwalls of the building, was designed in the Cheshire fashion, with\r\ndraw-pins, tholes and spring-heads tinctured to a sober brown. The oak\r\nwas imported from the distant Baltic and strengthened with iron as a\r\nprecaution against the gape and the warp.\r\n\r\nThe glass, which was separate from the house and stood in a great dome\r\nand tunnel higher up on the hillside where it sheltered the Victoria\r\nRegia, the tobacco plant, the curious and carnivorous _Hepteryx\r\nRawlinsonia_, the palm and the common vine. A lodge guarded both\r\nthe northern and the southern entrances and a considerable approach\r\nswept up past the two greyhounds which dignified the cast-iron gates;\r\nthemselves a copy, upon a smaller scale, of the more famous Guardini's\r\nat Bensington, while the main door was of pure elm studded with one\r\nhundred and fifty-three large nails. The rooms within were heated not\r\nonly by fireplaces of exquisite decoration, but also secretly by pipes\r\nwhich ran beneath the floors and had this inconvenience, that the\r\ncaptious, withdrawing from the fierceness of the blaze to some distant\r\nmargin of the apartment, would marvel at the suffocating heat which\r\nstruck them in the chance corner of their retirement.\r\n\r\nOf the numerous bath-rooms fitted in copper and Dutch tiles, of the\r\nchapel, the vesting chamber and the great number of bedrooms--many\r\nwith dressing-rooms attached--I need not speak.\r\n\r\nThe stables were connected with the mansion by a covered way, which\r\nthe guests could use in all weathers when there was occasion to visit\r\nthe stables and to admire Aster, West Wind, Cœur de Lion, Ex Calibur,\r\nAbde-el-Kader, and the little pink pony, Pompey, which was permanently\r\nlame, but had caught Mrs. Clutterbuck's eye at Lady Moreton's sale, and\r\nhad cost no less than 250 guineas.\r\n\r\n\"The Plâs\" was the simple name suggested somewhat later by Charlie\r\nFitzgerald, but for the moment Mr. and Mrs. Clutterbuck, well\r\nacquainted with the hesitation of all cultured people to adopt\r\npretentious names for their residences, were content to leave it\r\nunchristened, and to allude to it among their acquaintance by nothing\r\nmore particular than the beautiful title of \"Home.\"\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1911 the last drier had been applied to the walls,\r\nand with the early summer of that year Mr. Clutterbuck and his wife\r\nsat before the first fire upon their new hearth. It was a fire of old\r\nship logs, and they were delighted to confirm the fact that it produced\r\nsmall particoloured flames.\r\n\r\nIf it be wondered why a fortune of barely half a million should\r\nhave been saddled with so spacious a building, it must be replied\r\nthat a large part of every important income must of necessity be\r\nexpended in luxury, and that the form of luxury which most appealed\r\nto this hospitable and childless pair was a roof under which they\r\nmight later entertain numerous gatherings of friends, while, to those\r\nlong accustomed during the active period of life to somewhat cramped\r\nsurroundings, ease of movement and spacious apartments are a great\r\nand a legitimate solace in declining years. Here Mr. Clutterbuck, did\r\nhe weary of his study, could wander at ease into the morning-room;\r\nfrom thence to the picture gallery which adjoined the well-lit hall,\r\nor if he chose to pursue his tour he could find the peacock-room, the\r\nJapanese room, the Indian room, and the Henri Quatre Alcove and Cosy\r\nCorner, and the Jacobean Snuggery awaiting him in turn. Had he been a\r\nyounger man he would probably have added a swimming-bath; as it was,\r\nthe omission of this appendage was all that marred the splendid series\r\nof apartments.\r\n\r\nDoubtless he had overbuilt, as ordinary standards of wealth are\r\ncounted, but the standards of financial genius are not those of\r\ncommerce, and this very excess it was which brought him the first\r\nbeginnings of his public career. It was impossible that display upon\r\nsuch a scale and so near London, should not attract the attention\r\nof households at once well-born and generous. Our political world is\r\never ready to admit to the directing society of the nation those whose\r\nprudence and success in business have shown them worthy of undertaking\r\nthe task of government. In the height of the season, as Mr. and Mrs.\r\nClutterbuck were sitting at their breakfast, a little lonely in the\r\nabsence of any guests in that great house, the lady's post was found to\r\ncontain an invitation from no less a leader of London than the widow of\r\nMr. Barttelot Smith.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMary Smith had about her every quality that entitled her to lead the\r\nworld, which she in fact did lead with admirable power. She had been\r\nborn a Bailey. Her mother was a Bunting; she was therefore of that well\r\nestablished middle rank which forms perhaps the strongest core in our\r\ngoverning class. Her husband, Barttelot Smith, of Bar Harbour, Maine,\r\nand the New Bessemer, Birmingham, Alabama, had died in 1891, after a\r\nvery brief married life, which had barely sufficed to introduce him to\r\nthe Old Country and a world of which the hours and the digestion were\r\nquite unsuitable to him.\r\n\r\nThe fortune of which his widow was left in command after her\r\nbereavement was ample for the part it was her genius to play; and\r\nthough her means were not of that exaggerated sort to which modern\r\nspeculation has accustomed us, yet her roomy house in St. James's\r\nPlace, her Scotch forest, the two places in Cumberland, and the place\r\nshe rented in the heart of the Quorn permitted her to entertain upon\r\na generous scale; while large and historic but cosy Habberton on the\r\nborders of Exmoor afforded a secure retreat for the few weeks in\r\nAugust, which, if she were in England, she devoted to the society of\r\nher intimates.\r\n\r\nShe was a woman of high culture, the intimate friend of the Prime\r\nMinister--not as a politician, but as a poet--and through her sister,\r\nLouise, the sister-in-law of the leader of the Opposition, whose\r\nextraordinary polo play in the early eighties had endeared him to the\r\nthen lively girl much more than could family ties.\r\n\r\nSuch other connections as she had with the political world were\r\nquite fortuitous. Her aunt, Lady Steyning, had seen, of course, the\r\nmost brilliant period of the Viceroyalty in India, before the recent\r\ndeplorable situation had destroyed at once the dignity and the leisure\r\nof that post; while a second aunt, the oldest of the three surviving\r\nDuchesses of Drayton, though living a very retired life at Molehurst,\r\nnaturally brought her into touch with the Ebbworths and all the Rusper\r\ngroup of old Whig families, from young Lord Rusper, to whom she was\r\nalmost an elder sister, to the rather disreputable, but extremely\r\nwealthy, Ockley couple, whom she chivalrously defended through the\r\nworst of the storm.\r\n\r\nIt would be a great error to imagine that this charming and tactful\r\nwoman found her interests in such a world alone--she was far too\r\nmany sided for that. Her collection of Fragonards had many years ago\r\nlaid at her feet the whole staff of the Persian Embassy, and opened\r\nan acquaintance with a world of Oriental experience; with it she\r\ndiscovered and cultivated the two chief Eastern travellers of our\r\ntime, Lord Hemsbury and Mr. Teak; upon quite another side her modest\r\nbut sincere and indefatigable interest in the lives of the poor\r\nhad naturally led to a warm understanding between herself and Lord\r\nLambeth--the indefatigable empire builder whom the world had known as\r\nMr. Barnett of the M'Korio, and who now, as the aged Duke of Battersea,\r\nhad earned by his unceasing good deeds, the half-playful, half-reverend\r\nnickname of \"Peabody Yid\" among the younger members of his set.\r\n\r\nIt was not a little thing to have gained the devotion of such a man,\r\nand it was, in a sense, the summit of Mary Smith's achievement: but she\r\nwas more than a sympathetic and universal friend; she was also--as\r\nsuch friends must always be--a power in both Political parties--and\r\nperhaps in three.\r\n\r\nIt was said--I know not with how much justice--that young Pulborough\r\n(who was his own father) owed his Secretaryship of State more to her\r\ndirect influence than to his blood relationship to the aunt by marriage\r\nof her second brother-in-law, The MacClure; and there were rumours,\r\ncertainly exaggerated, that when the Board of Trade was filled after\r\nIllingsbury had fled the country, Paston's marriage with her niece\r\nElizabeth had decided his appointment.\r\n\r\nI am careful to omit any reference to the Attorney-General of the\r\nday--it was mere gossip--nor will I tarry upon her brother at the Home\r\nOffice, or her Uncle Harry at Dublin Castle, lest I should lead the\r\nreader to imagine that her well-earned influence depended on something\r\nother than her great soul and admirable heart.\r\n\r\nIt was a generous impulse in such a woman to send the large gilt\r\noblong of pasteboard which was the key to her house, and to a seat at\r\nher board, to the lonely and now ageing couple in their retirement in\r\nthe Caterham Valley. But Mrs. Smith, even in her most heartfelt and\r\nspontaneous actions, had always in view the nature of our political\r\ninstitutions. The sudden fortune of Mr. Clutterbuck had no doubt been\r\nexaggerated in the numerous conversations upon it which had enlivened\r\nher drawing-room; if so, it was an error upon the right side, and her\r\ninstinct told her that she could not be much to blame in giving such a\r\nman the opportunity to enter into the fuller life of his country.\r\n\r\nEvery rank in our carefully ordered society has its conventions; one,\r\nwhich will doubtless appear ridiculous to many of my readers, is that\r\nwhich forbids, among the middle classes, the extension of a warm\r\ninvitation to people whom one never happens to have seen. The basis for\r\nthis suburban convention it would be impossible to discover, but then,\r\nconvention is not logical; and whatever may be the historic origin of\r\nthe fetich, certain it is that most of our merchants and professional\r\nmen would never dream of asking a Cabinet minister or a peer to their\r\nhouses until at least a formal introduction had passed between them and\r\nthe statesman so honoured.\r\n\r\nThe converse is not true at all; our public men would accept or reject\r\nsuch an invite as convenience dictated, and would hardly remember\r\nwhether they had the pleasure of an acquaintance or no: they approach\r\nmen of lesser value with unaffected ease and find it difficult to\r\ntolerate the strict ritual of a narrower class; but their own society,\r\nas they would be the first to admit, has its own body of unreasoning\r\netiquette, the more difficult to recognise because it is so familiar;\r\nBuffle himself, for instance, would hardly tolerate a question in\r\nParliament upon his recent escapade.\r\n\r\nThe varying codes of varying strata of society are the cause of\r\nendless misunderstandings; such a misunderstanding might have arisen\r\nnow, but once again it was a woman that saved the jar. Mary Smith\r\nhad unwittingly gone near to the line of offence, in the eyes of Mr.\r\nClutterbuck at least, when she posted her well-meant card for July\r\n2. Mrs. Clutterbuck had not only a wider social experience than her\r\nhusband, but could also rely upon the instinctive psychology of her\r\nsex. She overruled at once, and very wisely, the petty objections of\r\nher husband to the form in which the acquaintance had been offered\r\nthem, and returned, by the morning's post in the third person and upon\r\npink paper, an acceptance to the kindly summons.\r\n\r\nThere were three weeks only in which to anticipate and prepare for\r\nthis novel experience, but they were three weeks during which Mr.\r\nClutterbuck was so thoroughly convinced by his wife, as very sincerely\r\nto regret the first comments he had made upon a custom to which his\r\nignorance of life had made him take exception.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in St. James's Place, the large and comfortable rooms which\r\nhad once been those of the exiled Bourbons and later of the Boxing\r\nClub were the scene of more than one conversation between Mary Smith\r\nand her friends in the matter of those whom Charlie Fitzgerald lightly\r\ncalled \"the mysterious guests.\"\r\n\r\n\"The less mysterious they are to you,\" said Mary Smith, nodding at this\r\nsame Charlie Fitzgerald one very private afternoon at tea, \"the better\r\nfor you.\" She shut her lips and nodded again at him with emphasis.\r\n\r\n\"Oh Lord! Mary,\" said Charlie Fitzgerald, \"is it going to be another of\r\nthem?\"\r\n\r\nHe was twenty years and more her junior, but she tolerated anything\r\nfrom the son of her favourite cousin; besides which, every one called\r\nher Mary, and if she was to be called Mary she would as soon be called\r\nMary by an intimate younger relation as by the crowd of chance men and\r\nwomen of her own age who used her name so freely.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" went on Mrs. Smith with decision, \"it's going to be another of\r\nthem; and this time I hope you'll stick.\"\r\n\r\nHer trim little body was full of energy as she said it, and her face\r\nfull of determination.\r\n\r\n\"It's never been my fault,\" said Fitzgerald reproachfully. \"Was it my\r\nfault that Isaacs got into trouble, or that old Burpham lost his temper\r\nabout the motor-car?\"\r\n\r\n\"The last was your fault certainly,\" answered his cousin vivaciously.\r\n\"If you take a man's money, you mustn't use his motor-car without his\r\nleave.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's an old cad,\" yawned Fitzgerald lazily.\r\n\r\n\"Every one knows that,\" said Mrs. Smith, \"and no one thinks the better\r\nof you for not understanding an old cad. It's a private secretary's\r\nbusiness to understand.... You won't get anything from me, anyhow, I\r\ncan tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've said that before,\" said Charlie, looking down at her with a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and I have kept it, too,\" said Mary.\r\n\r\nTo which he answered with some emphasis: \"By God you have!\" and looking\r\nout into the trees in the Green Park he fell into a reverie, the\r\nmonotone of which was his large and increasing indebtedness. It did\r\nnot trouble him, but it furnished a constant food for his thoughts and\r\nlent him just that interest in the acquirement of money which his Irish\r\ncharacter perhaps needed.\r\n\r\nLater, as the room filled with callers, the conversation upon the\r\nClutterbucks became more general. A certain Mr. Higginson, who was\r\nvery smart indeed and wrote for the papers, was able to give the most\r\nprecise information: Old Clutterbuck had been worth four millions; he'd\r\ndropped a lot on house property in Paris. He was worth nearly three\r\nanyhow, but he was a miserly old beggar. He had made it by frightening\r\nCharley Hatton.\r\n\r\nAt this all of his audience were pleased and several laughed.\r\n\r\n\"I'd frighten the beggar for less than four millions,\" said Charlie\r\nFitzgerald. He spread out his arms and made a loud roaring noise to\r\nshow how he'd do it, to the huge amusement of an aged general who loved\r\nyouth and high spirits, but to the no small annoyance of Mr. Higginson,\r\nwho hated being interrupted.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" said Mary Smith, pouring out tea for a new caller in the\r\nold familiar way (she detested a pack of servants and kept hers for\r\nthe most part in the double-decked basement underground). \"Nonsense! I\r\nbelieve he made it perfectly honestly. He's got a dear old face!\"\r\n\r\nMary Smith had never seen his face, but a good word is never thrown\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\"He's got an old hag of a wife,\" blurted out the General, \"an old----\"\r\n\r\nMary Smith put up her hand. \"Now do be careful--you used that word only\r\nlast Thursday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord!\" said Charlie Fitzgerald; \"what a long time.\" And the\r\nGeneral and he, who had lunched together that same day, were amused\r\nbeyond the ordinary at the simple jest.\r\n\r\n\"I've never seen his wife,\" said Mary Smith severely and with perfect\r\ntruth. \"She's probably just like everybody else. You people make up\r\nideas in your heads about classes that don't exist. Everybody's just\r\nlike everybody else.... Look at old Bolney!\"\r\n\r\n\"Damned if he's like anybody else!\" said Miss Mosel, taking her\r\ncigarette out of her mouth and picking a long shred of yellow tobacco\r\nfrom her underlip at the same time. \"Mamma calls him Cow Bolney.\"\r\n\r\n\"She's quite wrong, my dear, thoroughly wrong,\" said the old General\r\nfussily. \"I wouldn't have believed it of your mother. I knew her when\r\nshe was your age.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't believe it now,\" said Mary Smith soothingly, \"Victoria tells\r\nlies.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't,\" said Miss Mosel stolidly. \"Anyhow I'm coming to see old\r\nClutterbuck.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if I know it,\" said Mary Smith grimly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't mean at dinner,\" caught up Victoria Mosel lightly. \"I\r\nwouldn't rag anybody's dinner, but you can't prevent my coming on,\r\nafter.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Smith gazed at her imploringly. \"Don't play the fool, Vic,\" she\r\nbegged.\r\n\r\n\"I shan't play the fool,\" said Victoria. \"I only want to look on: I\r\nwon't touch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who you goin' to get?\" asked Charlie.\r\n\r\n\"Well, there's _you_,\" spreading out her fingers in what had been for\r\nhalf a lifetime a pretty affectation of hers, and ticking them off.\r\n\"And there's old Mother D. of Drayton, and I shall try to get the Duke.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, your perpetual Peabody Yid,\" began Charlie.\r\n\r\n\"Don't,\" said his cousin, laughing with great charm.\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes, the Duke, and I've got _him_ already,\" she said pointing to\r\nthe General. \"And ... and I must have William.\"\r\n\r\nVic Mosel and Mr. Higginson shouted together: \"Risking William! Oh! I\r\nsay!\" while Charlie's eye gleamed at the mention of her brother's name\r\nand he gloated on the prospect of a really good shindy.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, fiddlesticks-ends,\" said Mary Smith. \"He's a white man: besides\r\nsome one must do host for me. _You're_ too green\" (she said that to\r\nFitzgerald), \"and he'll behave all right. I'll warn him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" she went on hurriedly, \"then there's Mrs. Carey and her mother,\r\nand the Steynings--I can't remember the whole lot. Perkins would tell\r\nyou. There's sixteen, I know that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll hold the sponge for William Bailey,\" said Charlie solemnly; \"the\r\nGeneral supports the Duke.\"\r\n\r\n\"If there's any row,\" said Mary Smith to him vigorously, \"I shall know\r\nwho started it, and who will lose by it. William's a dear.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so the flashing talk went round, while, with Mr. Clutterbuck in the\r\nCaterham glens, the hours crept on towards an appointed day; and the\r\nhorses were exercised and the motors ran, and the lake slowly filled,\r\nand parties, a little larger with each succeeding week, groups of their\r\nold friends and of their new, met and drank champagne at lunch, at\r\ndinner, and at supper too, until June was ended.\r\n\r\nThe second of July was warm and fine: an open motor would have pleased\r\nMr. Clutterbuck for the run to town,--but Mrs. Clutterbuck, Mrs.\r\nClutterbuck knew! It was in the Limousine that they swept up the\r\nLondon Road, past the Palace and round into St. James's Place. Mr.\r\nClutterbuck, who had long secretly wondered how those great houses upon\r\nthe Park were approached at all, and who had half believed that some\r\nroyal entry, hidden from the vulgar gaze, led into them, saw this great\r\nmystery solved: he was silent upon his discovery. He wondered whether\r\none should tell the motor to go into the stables of the house, or what:\r\nand again Mrs. Clutterbuck knew. She left it for the motor man and the\r\nbig flunkeys to thresh out between them.\r\n\r\nWhen they were at table the many lights, the much wine and the more\r\ntalk entered her husband's soul and warmed it. The lights greatly\r\npleased him; the wine he drank freely. He was beginning to live.\r\n\r\nHe noted curiously the faces round the great table, and asked his\r\nneighbour the names of more than one; that neighbour was Mrs. Carey,\r\nthan whom he could have had no better guide, for she knew every face\r\nin London, to the number of two hundred or more. She pointed out the\r\nlarge, beneficent features of the Duke of Battersea where he sat at\r\nMary Smith's right, hardly able to take his eyes from her face. Mr.\r\nClutterbuck in his turn gazed long and with increasing awe at the man\r\nwhose name stood for the power of England in so many distant harbours,\r\nand whose career in finance was the model and the envy of all his own\r\nsociety. He strained to listen and catch some word falling from his\r\nlips, but the hubbub was too loud. The bright young laughing face\r\nto his left was that of Charlie Fitzgerald, but he did not need the\r\ninformation, for Mary Smith had been careful to introduce the lad with\r\nan unmistakable intonation, and, as though by inadvertence, twice\r\nover. The tall, square-faced, whiskered, spectacled man opposite who\r\nsipped his soup as though every taste of it were to be thought out and\r\nappreciated, was, he learnt, Mr. William Bailey, the brother of his\r\nhostess; and as Mrs. Carey told him that name, she laughed discreetly,\r\nfor the eccentricities of Mr. William Bailey, though they were not\r\nalways harmless, were never without point to women of Mrs. Carey's\r\nsuperficial character. She saw nothing in them but matter for her own\r\namusement.\r\n\r\nNothing perhaps struck Mr. Clutterbuck more in the great society he\r\nhad entered than the superb ease which distinguished it. Every member\r\nof that world seemed free to pursue his own appetite or inclination\r\nwithout restraint of form, and yet the whole was bound by just that\r\ninvisible limit which is the framework of good breeding. Here on his\r\nright was Lord Steyning, talking at the top of his voice; a little\r\nnearer Charlie Fitzgerald was whispering across his neighbour, Miss\r\nCarey, to another guest whose name Mr. Clutterbuck did not know. The\r\nDuke of Battersea felt no necessity to talk to any one beside his\r\nhostess, or to take his eyes for more than a moment from her face;\r\nwhile Mr. William Bailey shocked no one by maintaining a perfect\r\nsilence, and staring gloomily through his spectacles at a \"Reynolds\"\r\nof his great grandfather, the Nabob, which he had frequently declared\r\nin mixed company to be a forgery. It was this atmosphere of freedom\r\nthat gave Mr. Clutterbuck his chief pleasure in an evening which he\r\nheartily, thoroughly, and uninterruptedly enjoyed.\r\n\r\nWhen the women had gone away and the men were sitting at their ease,\r\nwith the silent William Bailey for host, a maze of acute interest\r\nsurrounded the merchant; he could hear the Duke of Battersea, a\r\nlittle grumpy in the absence of the hostess, praising Lord Steyning\r\nto his face for the arrangement of his garden, and turning his back\r\non Mr. Bailey, which gentleman, speaking for almost the first time\r\nthat evening, shoved up close to Mr. Clutterbuck and maintained his\r\ncharacter for oddity by asking how he liked the Peabody Yid.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck, uncertain whether this were a novel, a play, or a new\r\ngame, but unwilling to betray his ignorance, said that it depended upon\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n\"It does,\" said Mr. Bailey, with emphasis; \"it's a jolly house, isn't\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck affirmed the grandeur and admirable appointment of\r\nthe house, but he could not help wondering whether William Bailey\r\nwould have been more pleased if he had found something to criticise.\r\nThen, as Charlie Fitzgerald turned to talk to Mr. Clutterbuck, William\r\nBailey relapsed again into his silence, an attitude of mind which he\r\ndiversified in no way save by pulling out a pencil and sketching, with\r\nsome exaggeration of the ears, nape, and curled ringlets, the back\r\nview presented to him by the venerable Duke of Battersea.\r\n\r\nUpstairs, Mary Smith, squatting familiarly beside Mrs. Clutterbuck,\r\ngiggled into her private ear with that delightful familiarity which had\r\never put her guests into her intimate confidence, and swept away every\r\nvestige of _gêne_ and of disparity in status. This charm of manner it\r\nwas for which those whom she still honoured chiefly loved her, and\r\nwhich those whom she had seen fit to drop most poignantly regretted.\r\n\r\nUpon Mrs. Clutterbuck, as she reclined on a Tutu Louis XVII., in an\r\nattitude full of charm and of repose yet instinct with self-control,\r\nthe spell of Mary Smith was powerful indeed. Her talk was of the\r\ngreat--and of their secretaries. She remembered stories of ambassadors,\r\nand of their secretaries as well; and in what she had to say concerning\r\nSecretaries of State, yet other secretaries of these secretaries\r\nappeared--unpaid secretaries and under-secretaries, parliamentary\r\nsecretaries, and common negligible secretaries who did secretarial\r\nwork. The functions, position, and weight of a secretary had never\r\nseemed so clear to Mrs. Clutterbuck before; nay, until that moment she\r\nhad given but little heed to the secretary's trade. She saw it now.\r\n\r\nBut all this was done so deftly and with such tact, and interrupted\r\nwith such merry little screams of laughter; in the course of it Mrs.\r\nClutterbuck was herself compelled to make so many confidences that the\r\natmosphere was one of mutual information, and the guest was confident\r\nthat she had contributed more than the hostess. When Mary Smith moved\r\noff to play general post with the guests, and, as her charming phrase\r\nwent, \"to make them to talk to one another,\" Mrs. Clutterbuck found how\r\nsingularly less a woman of the world was Mrs. Smith's somewhat prudish\r\naunt, Lady Steyning, long at Simla, some time our ambassadress at\r\nWashington, and now about to be at the head of the Embassy in Paris. As\r\nfor Mrs. Carey, Mrs. Clutterbuck regarded her with loathing.\r\n\r\nDownstairs Charlie Fitzgerald had been drinking port, and, keeping his\r\nright hand firmly fixed upon the neck of the decanter, he had poured\r\nout wine at intervals for Mr. Clutterbuck with a gesture which he\r\nfalsely termed \"passing the bottle.\" He had not his cousin's manner or\r\nscience in the handling of a conversation, but the wine, though bad,\r\nwas a bond between them; they drank it largely, especially Fitzgerald:\r\nit enabled him to recite with passion and Mr. Clutterbuck to receive\r\nwith faith, anecdotes of yet another batch of secretaries, and of Mr.\r\nFitzgerald's own adventures in his confidential relations with the\r\ndiscredited Isaacs and the aged but irascible Lord Burpham; a last\r\nengagement which he had apparently terminated from his fixed decision\r\nto undertake no such work in the future, but to live the life of a\r\nprivate gentleman, and possibly to enter the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible for Mr. Clutterbuck not to contrast again the\r\nspontaneity and ease of the world round him with the much more sterile\r\nassociations of his middle and later manhood. Nor did anything please\r\nhim more in that ease and spontaneity than the Irish good nature\r\nwith which Charlie Fitzgerald poured at his feet his wealth of\r\nsocial experience, and especially his experience in that secretarial\r\nphase which Mr. Clutterbuck sincerely regretted that he should have\r\nentirely abandoned. He could not help thinking, as he looked at the\r\nhandsome curly head and merry eyes, and as he heard the names of\r\nthe great and good flash constantly from the lips before him, how\r\nperfect would that arrangement be which should permit some humbler\r\nbut similar man to be to him what Charlie Fitzgerald seemed to have\r\nbeen to the eminent financier and the hot-tempered politician;\r\na-second-and-a-younger-eye-and-brain.\r\n\r\nAs they came into the drawing-room together, they were already fast\r\nfriends, and such was the effect of the atmosphere about him and\r\nthe exhilarating evening he had passed, that Mrs. Smith found it\r\nquite impossible to make her Clutterbuck speak to any one save his\r\nnew-found acquaintance: a disappointment to those ladies who had heard\r\nexaggerated accounts of his wealth, and were already interested in his\r\ncrescent-shaped moustaches and the fan of grey hair which he displayed\r\nover his considerable forehead.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck noticed with some astonishment--if anything could\r\nastonish him now--the entry of further guests at a late hour. They\r\ncame, as it seemed to him, without introduction and without ceremonial.\r\nAnd he wondered, as he followed the imperial carriage and gestures of\r\nVictoria Mosel among the rest, whether he also in some future year\r\nmight be found drifting thus through open doors free from the weary\r\nnecessities of etiquette. He doubted it.\r\n\r\nThey left at half-past eleven, and all the way home Mrs. Clutterbuck\r\ncomplained of fatigue. But her husband, upon his arrival, felt it\r\nnecessary to continue the evening, and far into the early morning drank\r\nyet more port, and considered the change in his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nThe season was not yet over. Mrs. Clutterbuck had called upon Mary\r\nSmith,--and if my readers will believe me,--Mary Smith had called upon\r\nMrs. Clutterbuck. And there had come a morning--Parliament was still\r\nsitting, the Goodwood Cup was not yet collared--when Mrs. Clutterbuck\r\nhaving heard for weeks past from Mr. Clutterbuck hints and guesses at\r\nthe necessity for a secretary to deal with his now numerous invitations\r\nand engagements, quietly suggested Charlie Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\nHad she suggested Tolstoi or the German Emperor she could not have\r\nsurprised him more. But when he heard that the proposition had\r\ncome from the family itself, that it had been largely due to Mr.\r\nFitzgerald's own pronounced affection, and that he would be content\r\nwith a nominal salary of £400 or £500 a year, Mr. Clutterbuck, though\r\nas much astonished as a man rapt into heaven, was convinced of the\r\nreality of the business, and the only thing that troubled him was the\r\nquestion of salary.\r\n\r\nHe paced up and down the room, suggesting to his wife the dilemma that\r\na sum of £1000 or £1500 a year was all the expense he would hesitate\r\nto incur, while less would be an insult he would hesitate to offer. To\r\nwhich her only and sharp reply was that the young man could surely look\r\nafter himself; that doubtless he had grown used to work of this sort\r\nand liked it, that he probably had means of his own, and that, anyhow,\r\nit had come from him, and that Mrs. Smith herself had spoken strongly\r\nin favour of the arrangement.\r\n\r\nHow long such a change might last only Fate could tell. It was the\r\nmiddle of the summer. When there were no more dinners to eat and no\r\nmore women to talk to, Charlie Fitzgerald, all life and boxes, came\r\ndown to Caterham, but not before going the round of some twenty-eight\r\ntradesmen in St. James's Street and Mayfair and assuring them that\r\nuntil the autumn he would be abroad.\r\n\r\nWith the entry of that vigorous young Irish life into Mr. Clutterbuck's\r\nhome, began the last adventures of the merchant's singularly\r\nadventurous life and his introduction to the conflicting destinies of\r\nhis country; for even if things had not bent that way, something in\r\nCharlie Fitzgerald's nature would have left him restless until he and\r\nthose for whom he worked had struck some mark.\r\n\r\nThe young Irishman was the son of that Doctor Fitzgerald the oculist,\r\nwho had been during all the later years of Queen Victoria's reign a\r\nlink, as it were, between the professional and the political world of\r\nLondon, and who was himself a younger son of Sir Daniel Fitzgerald,\r\nthe permanent head of the Fisheries whose name appears so frequently\r\nin Lady Cotteswold's Memoirs of Prince Albert and the Queen's early\r\nmarried life. Lady Fitzgerald, his wife, had been a Bailey, and the\r\naunt, therefore, of Mrs. Smith.\r\n\r\nIt had not been thought necessary to dower her with any portion of\r\nthe great Bailey fortune, for in those days the Irish land upon which\r\nSir Daniel had foreclosed was a very ample provision even for onerous\r\nsocial duties in London, and the Baileys asked nothing of the eager\r\nlover but that he should adopt the name of Fitzgerald which had for\r\ncenturies been associated with the estate his ardent forethought had\r\nacquired.\r\n\r\nIn those days a change of name demanded certain formalities; these were\r\nsoon fulfilled, and in Charlie's generation, the third to bear the\r\nIrish title and arms, the original form \"Daniel Daniels\" was justly\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nSince the days of Sir Daniel Irish land has passed through a\r\nrevolution, especially when it has been held by those whose duties\r\ndid not necessitate a visit to their estates. Sir Daniel's heir,\r\nthe oculist's eldest brother, would have died impoverished had not\r\nthe Government very properly succoured the son of so distinguished a\r\nCivil servant and created for him the post of Inspector in the Channel\r\nIslands (with the exception of Sark), a district in which he was\r\nunderstood to be present twice or even three times in a year. This\r\nsalary died of course with its incumbent; his brother, the oculist, had\r\nbeen compelled to spend in hospitality his exceptional earnings, and\r\nthe present generation of young men, sons of either brother, had had to\r\nface life unguarded.\r\n\r\nIt was not an easy position for boys used to the conversation and\r\nhabits of the wealthiest society in the world. But much was done for\r\nthem. Edward was married to the half-witted daughter of Sir John\r\nGarstang the cotton-spinner; Henry was put into the Scotch Education\r\nOffice; Philip died, and Charlie, in spite of the mistake about\r\nMr. Isaacs, would have done very well out of Lord Burpham if his\r\nincorrigible Irish character had not run away with him and with the\r\nmotor-car of that eminent director of our Foreign Affairs. \"Irish,\" I\r\nsay, for Ireland was apparent in all that poor Charlie did, for though\r\nhis mother was of pure German stock and strongly Protestant, while his\r\naccent was that of Eton College, yet his friends could easily descry in\r\nall his extravagances and escapades the adventurous Irish influence of\r\nhis grandfather's estate. His cousins, through the Baileys (who were of\r\npure English or Indian lineage), Jim in the Foreign Office and \"Nobby\"\r\nwho had means and was, after a spell in the Heralds' College, at large,\r\nthe Steynings and the rest, saw this Hibernian brilliance more clearly\r\nthan any, and made it a permanent if insufficient excuse for his\r\nvagaries.\r\n\r\nIt was Boswell Delacourt who first suggested politics to Charlie\r\nFitzgerald, and Fate did the rest.\r\n\r\nBoswell Delacourt was not exactly a relative of Charlie Fitzgerald's,\r\nexcept in so far as everybody can be said to be related to everybody\r\nelse; he was no more than a connection by marriage. But he did think it\r\nhard that a man of Mr. Clutterbuck's antecedents and position should\r\nstand aloof from political life. Nowhere can money be more usefully\r\nspent for the country than in the support of great political ideals,\r\nand nowhere can the wide experience and hard mental training of a\r\ncommercial career do more for England than in the House of Commons.\r\nNor did any one appreciate these truths more than Boswell Delacourt,\r\nnor did any of the younger people who were working in the organisation\r\nof the National Party work harder than he to spread them abroad. He\r\nhammered at Fitzgerald, and Fitzgerald did his duty.\r\n\r\nThe new Secretary had passed the whole summer without a word of\r\ncomplaint, cooped up in the new house at Caterham; he had spent his\r\nenergies in suggesting the purchase of books, the removal of pictures,\r\nand the renaming of the estate; he had recommended horses, cigars,\r\nwines, traps, motors, and jewellery, and sold them again with ready\r\ndecision when he thought them unworthy; he had attended to all the\r\ncorrespondence, signed nearly all the cheques, received payment against\r\nall exchanges, and spared his host every sort of financial worry; he\r\nhad compelled not a few of his own friends, in spite of their intense\r\nreluctance, to spend Saturday to Monday under that roof; with noble\r\nperseverance he had run the light Panhard himself for incredible\r\ndistances and at a speed which Mr. Clutterbuck could hardly bear; he\r\nhad done all these things for nearly two months without a respite,\r\nwhen, late in September, having forsworn all opportunities to shoot, he\r\ntackled the great affair.\r\n\r\nIt was in the second smoking-room some time before dinner that the\r\nelder man and the younger sipping sherry and bitters, began their\r\nfateful conversation.\r\n\r\nCharlie Fitzgerald first introduced the business--and he launched it\r\nfair and clean, for when Mr. Clutterbuck had said in a ruminating sort\r\nof way \"The days are drawing in, Mr. Fitzgerald,\" Charlie Fitzgerald\r\nhad answered:\r\n\r\n\"Yes---- Why don't you send something to the Party Funds?\"\r\n\r\nSince his secretary had been in the house, Mr. Clutterbuck had\r\nauthorised not a few large cheques, and had let Charlie sign many\r\nmore. He wondered what new claim this might be, but he hardly liked to\r\nventure an opinion. He thought it better to wait a moment and let time\r\nor the goddess Chance illuminate him.\r\n\r\n\"You see, after all,\" said Fitzgerald, spreading out one hand towards\r\nthe fire, \"they expect it ... don't they?\" he asked sympathetically,\r\nlooking up sideways in Mr. Clutterbuck's face.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck in a maze, \"yes\"--thoughtfully--\"I suppose\r\nthey do.\" But who they were, or what it was they expected, torture\r\ncould not have got out of him.\r\n\r\n\"Well--you see----\" went on Charlie in the tone of interest and\r\nthought which men adopt when they are putting a proposition carefully\r\nto another, \"it's only natural they should. You can't carry on either\r\nof the great Parties for nothing, and lots of men expect to get\r\neverything out of politics and to put nothing in; and then there are\r\nothers who don't care about being in the movement. It's a difficult job\r\naltogether.\" Then he added in a thoroughly different tone: \"They were\r\nin a damned tight hole in '95!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mr. Fitzgerald,\" said the older man again. He had appreciated by\r\nthis time perhaps one quarter of the affair.\r\n\r\n\"Bozzy,\" went on Fitzgerald, \"Bozzy says that it goes up and down like\r\na Jack-in-the-box. One election hardly anything, and then before they\r\nknow where they are--millions! But I don't believe it\"--he wagged his\r\nhead wisely and leaned back again--\"don't believe a word of it. There\r\nmust always be a balance in hand, and a fat one too. Think of it!\" he\r\nwent on, \"think of all it's got to _do_--Damn elections! They only come\r\nonce in five years anyhow. Look at all that's got to go on meanwhile?\r\nYou can't advertise for nothing, and you can't print for nothing, and\r\nyou can't get men to start newspapers, that don't pay, in Egypt for\r\nnothing; and you can't get your information abroad and in America for\r\nnothing. It's all rubbish to say that they let it go fut! It is true\r\nthey get in a hole sometimes. And I say they were both in a hole in\r\n'95.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck still sat silent.\r\n\r\n\"You will say,\" continued Fitzgerald rapidly after a short interval, as\r\nhe stood up against the mantelpiece with his back to the fire, \"you'll\r\nsay----\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I won't,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck, \"I assure you, Mr. Fitzgerald, I\r\nshall put no obstacle in the way of such a decision.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--but,\" returned his secretary, \"you see it really must be\r\nexplained--you can't leap in the dark.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck with determination.\r\n\r\n\"That's it,\" said Charlie Fitzgerald, dropping his chin and looking\r\nprofoundly at the carpet.\r\n\r\nThere was a considerable interval of silence, and Mr. Clutterbuck,\r\nwho fully appreciated that this new world was not the lucid world of\r\ncommerce, or, rather, that it had a language of its own with which he\r\nwas not yet familiar, forebore to ask a question. Nay, it would have\r\npuzzled him very considerably to frame a question so that it should\r\nrelate to anything intelligible, human or divine. But as Charles\r\nFitzgerald remained quite silent, the merchant did venture to suggest\r\nthat he would gladly and heartily do anything that was expected of him\r\nin the matter.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know,\" said Fitzgerald, pacing towards the window. \"I wasn't\r\nbothering about that. I'm sure you would. But I was thinking which\r\nParty.... You see, in the old days,\" he said, suddenly facing round,\r\n\"it was simple enough: you had your set and your set went Whig, and\r\nit was all plain sailing, but then the old days were beastly corrupt,\r\nand what a man spent he liked to spend on his own people. There's a\r\nplace over the hill there,\" he said, jerking his head backwards towards\r\nGatton, \"where my great uncle's father-in-law was--seven electors and\r\n£20,000. But they won't tolerate that now. So there you are! You got to\r\nask yourself which Party. Then there's another trouble: there used to\r\nbe only two Parties; now they're five, and look like seven.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck's mind moved forward by one cog, and he saw that the\r\ntalk had something to do with the nuances of the House of Commons.\r\nHe let Fitzgerald go on, but he could have wished that young man of\r\nbreeding would make himself clearer, unless, indeed, this method of\r\naddress were native or in some way necessary to exalted rank.\r\n\r\n\"Bozzy says,\" began Fitzgerald, \"there are really only two party-funds\r\nagain, now the National Party's kept going two years, and I 'spose he's\r\nright. Nobody gives to the Irish except the Irish, and that's a sort of\r\naudit sheet business, like the Labour people. And the Radicals haven't\r\ngot a regular organisation. Then, of course, you might say, 'Why not\r\ngive to both?' like the Stanfords.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are the Stanfords, Mr. Fitzgerald?\" broke in the master of the\r\nhouse, clutching like a drowning man at a straw.\r\n\r\n\"Lord Stanford and his wife,\" said Charlie Fitzgerald innocently. \"Old\r\nBill Lewisohn that was; they call it Lewis and Lewis still.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck humbly.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Fitzgerald, getting his second wind, \"as I say, you might\r\nsay 'Why not give to both, like the Stanfords?' Frankly, I don't think\r\nit pays. He gives to the Opposition, anyway he _did_ give to the\r\nOpposition before the General Election because of the peerage; and she\r\ngives to the Nationals _now_ because of the Church Bill. But it doesn't\r\npay. They don't get half the attention either of 'em would get singly.\r\nBesides which,\" he added, \"a man must consult his convictions. Course\r\nhe must.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mr. Fitzgerald,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck, who now at last perceived\r\nthat the elements of the tangle consisted of a sum of money, his\r\npolitical convictions, and the Party system. \"I've never concealed\r\nmine. I was a Conservative as long as I took any interest in politics.\r\nBut the 1906 administration was a good one; the 1908 was a better. Then\r\nwhen this Coalition came I was hard at work and not bothering about\r\npolitics: I suppose I'd have gone National. But not altogether, you\r\nknow; and as for the first tariff--well, I'm out of business now, and\r\nI suppose I oughtn't to lose my temper. As one gets older,\" he added\r\nwearily, \"one cares much less about these things.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it,\" said Fitzgerald suddenly, determined to keep it alight.\r\n\"You're ab-so-lute-ly right ... it's just because practical business\r\nmen know the harm the first tariff did, that the Nationals want their\r\nhelp--help o' men like _you_. Rubber, for instance: Congo rubber.\r\nAfter all, you know more about it than twenty of the politicians put\r\ntogether. I tell you what,\" he added, \"buzz down with me to-morrow and\r\nsee Bozzy--Bozzy Delacourt. He's a sort of relation of mine, and he'll\r\ntell you a lot more about it than I could. We wouldn't have to go to\r\nthe head offices in Peter Street: he'll give us lunch. I'll telephone\r\nthrough to him.\" And the happy but loquacious fellow went out upon that\r\nerrand.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck, left alone to his own thoughts, carefully unravelled\r\nthem and picked them out clearly strand from strand: that he was\r\nexpected, to his own advantage, to subscribe a sum of money; that he\r\nwas expected to subscribe it to a political party; that a man called\r\nBozzy, who was also called Delacourt, was in the inner ring of such\r\naffairs, and that of the two Parties it would best suit a merchant of\r\nhis standing to tender such financial support, through the said Bozzy,\r\nto the Party in power.\r\n\r\nWhen he had put the thing thus to himself it seemed much simpler; he\r\nwas prepared for the business before him, and next day Delacourt's\r\nperfectly lucid and very straightforward manner finished the affair.\r\nHe found that so small a sum as a thousand pounds was received on\r\nbehalf of the great organisation with the greatest dignity and\r\ncourtesy, and that his support was as warmly acknowledged as though\r\nhe had given twenty times that sum. When the formality was over,\r\nDelacourt, detaining him over the wine, said gravely:\r\n\r\n\"We all have to do what we can, Mr. Clutterbuck, but the real loss\r\nto the New Tariff nowadays isn't in money. You all come forward most\r\ngenerously. Our trouble is that we can't get the candidates we used to.\r\nWe can't get the Old Commercial Member who could drive it down in the\r\nHouse with fact and grip and experience. We couldn't ask a man like\r\nyou to stand, for instance, Mr. Clutterbuck, because the work has got\r\nso hard; but it's a great pity. It all gets handed over to the young\r\njournalists and the lawyers.\" He went on to rattle off with ease and\r\nfamiliarity a dozen great names in the City connected with the Liberal\r\nbenches and with the Conservative in the old free trade days, names\r\nthat were the names of gods to the astonished Mr. Clutterbuck, who had\r\nnever heard them pronounced in so everyday a fashion before.\r\n\r\n\"There's where you'd have been in the old days, Mr. Clutterbuck,\" said\r\nBozzy with ardour, \"but we wouldn't dare to ask you now.\"\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Clutterbuck's experience this was but a delicate way of telling\r\nhim that a seat in Parliament was quite out of his reach. But the\r\nsuggestion had moved him, and moved him profoundly. Of Parliament, of\r\nmen who stood for Parliament, of the Northern manufacturers especially\r\nand their qualifications, of the London members, and of a hundred other\r\nsimilar things, he talked eagerly to Fitzgerald through the afternoon,\r\nas the Limousine shot back to the Surrey Hills.\r\n\r\nThat night Charlie Fitzgerald, before going to bed, wrote a note\r\ncontaining the simple information that the old blighter would take it\r\nout of the hand. Then he bethought himself of the danger of written\r\nmessages and of the advantages of modern invention. He burnt the note,\r\nrang up Bozzy on the telephone, found him in no very good humour just\r\nback from a boring play, and informed him in bad French that he had no\r\nneed to shoot further: the opossum would come down when he was called.\r\n\r\nFour days later Mr. Clutterbuck received a lengthy and very careful\r\nletter upon the official paper of Peter Street. It contained a\r\nstatement and a proposal, both highly confidential. The statement was\r\nto the effect that the borough of Mickleton in North London would\r\nvery probably be vacant in a few weeks; for what reasons could not\r\neasily be written. The proposition--made with infinite tact and with\r\nthe most courteous recognition of the very high favour Mr. Clutterbuck\r\nwould be doing the Party should he accede--was that he should accept\r\nthe Prospective National Candidature at once in time to make himself\r\nfamiliar with the constituency, supposing always that the National\r\nCommittee of that borough should be instructed by the General Meeting\r\nto urge their Executive Body to demand Mr. Clutterbuck's services.\r\n\r\nThe Opposition majority, Delacourt admitted, was a high one--no less\r\nthan 851, as the books of reference would inform him. But a great\r\npart of this was due to the female vote, which had naturally been\r\ngiven to the Party who had pressed their claims during the recent\r\nadministration; and though he did not pretend to prophesy victory, he\r\ncould assure Mr. Clutterbuck that the proposition would never have been\r\nmade to him had not the chances of victory been such as to make that\r\nproposal an honourable one.\r\n\r\nAs for Mr. Clutterbuck, he sat that night upon a throne.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Clutterbuck the stages by which a man may enter the\r\nRepresentative Chamber were far from familiar. Charlie Fitzgerald had\r\nindulged in political sport more than once, and though he would not\r\ncompare it to motoring, or even to really good yachting, he confessed\r\nthat it attracted him, and he would often go off for a day or two's\r\nelectioneering when the occasion served, at the request of a friend;\r\nnay, on the last occasion he had given up a capital day's shooting to\r\nsee cousin \"Nobby\" handsomely beaten in Derbyshire by 3286. It was\r\nexcitement of which he did not easily tire. But as he described the\r\nfirst processes with gusto to Mr. Clutterbuck, that gentleman perceived\r\nthat the road to Parliament was not as smooth or as simple as he had\r\nvaguely imagined: and of all the obstacles that lay between him and the\r\nfinal stages of a political career, none did he dread more than the\r\nfirst, which was fixed for October 5. For though the Mickleton National\r\nCommittee had indeed, as Mr. Delacourt hoped, received orders for the\r\nGeneral Meeting to instruct their Executive to approach the merchant,\r\nand though he had at once given a warm reply in the affirmative, it was\r\nstill their public duty to examine Mr. Clutterbuck upon the orthodoxy\r\nof his political faith; it was this that appalled him. He prepared for\r\nthe inquisition with sweat and agony. He read at Fitzgerald's order\r\n\"The National Year Book,\" \"A Thousand Points on Nationalism,\" \"What is\r\na Nationalist?\" \"Why I am a Nationalist,\" and was relieving himself\r\nwith \"Platform Jokes\" when he was bidden leave that useful compendium\r\nto a later stage. There would be little joking on October 5!\r\n\r\nHe very humbly and sincerely followed the instructions of his secretary\r\nin the details of the interrogators he would have to meet; he noted the\r\nforeign wrongs which he desired redressed, the wickedness of European\r\nGovernments and their particular crimes, the domestic evils whose mere\r\nexistence darkened the sun, and the personal habits which were expected\r\nof him--notably total abstinence. One thing above all he learnt; it was\r\ndrummed into him till he knew it by heart; no matter what the committee\r\nmight say or think, no matter what pressure he might suffer, he was to\r\npledge himself boldly against his party in the matter of the Offences\r\nDisenfranchisement Bill.\r\n\r\nOn that Charlie was adamant. \"It looks easy now,\" he said (alas! did\r\nit?); \"but it may be the devil and all on the 5th of October.\"\r\n\r\nWhat precisely the measure might be, Fitzgerald, who had himself not\r\nstudied it minutely, thought it as well to leave aside. The simpler\r\nthe manly reply, the better. He was sure it was the Government's one\r\nmistake.\r\n\r\nThe programme was thoroughly threshed out, often repeated, fixed, and\r\nas the fatal day approached, Mr. Clutterbuck felt himself armoured;\r\nbut not before he had, again on Charlie Fitzgerald's advice, written\r\nout, quite spontaneously, a note and a cheque for £100 to the United\r\nSons of Endeavour. It was a religious association of young men which\r\ndid strenuous work among the poor of Mickleton, distributed large\r\nsums every quarter in salaries to its vast organisation, and had upon\r\nits membership representatives of nearly every family of note in the\r\nborough.\r\n\r\nOctober 5 was a glorious autumn day, and it was the open Renault\r\nwhich was chosen. The interview was to take place in the North Street\r\nschools at four; just after lunch Mr. Clutterbuck, already passably\r\nnervous, and Charlie Fitzgerald in the highest of high spirits, started\r\nnorthward.\r\n\r\nAs they left the more familiar parts of London behind them, and passed\r\nthrough miles of sordid and obscure streets, Mr. Clutterbuck's vitality\r\nsteadily fell. Public engagements of every kind were ill suited to his\r\ntemperament; the thought of public examination was abhorrent to him.\r\nHe fortified himself by an occasional mental glance at his financial\r\nposition and a comparison between it and that of the pigmies who would\r\nthat day presume to be his Judges, but even this great balm for human\r\nwoe hardly comforted him as the horrid perspective of North Street\r\nswung into view and the car stopped with a jerk in front of the dreary\r\nwall of the schools.\r\n\r\nHe was glad, from the very bottom of his heart, to be accompanied by\r\nCharlie Fitzgerald, whose exceedingly good grey clothes, very curly\r\nbrown hair and frank boyish eyes, would have been a protection to any\r\nman in an ordeal even more severe than that which Mr. Clutterbuck had\r\nto face.\r\n\r\nFor a few minutes they sat together in a little bare room furnished\r\nas to the floor with a dead stove without a fire, and as to the walls\r\nwith a glazed picture for the instruction of the young--a picture\r\nrepresenting an elephant in his natural colours, and underneath it in\r\nlarge letters:\r\n\r\n EL-E-PHANT (Mammal)\r\n\r\n  This huge crea-ture is an in-hab-i-tant of our In-di-an Em-pire.\r\n\r\nAt this work Mr. Clutterbuck mournfully gazed during his period of\r\nprobation, whilst Charlie Fitzgerald first swung his clasped hands\r\nbetween his knees, then crossed his legs, leaned his head back, and\r\nhummed the old Gaiety _pas de quatre_ which had rejoiced his boyhood.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the door opened and Mr. Clutterbuck and his companion were\r\ngravely summoned into the presence of the Executive.\r\n\r\nOf the various functions filled by an Executive, a Committee, a\r\nBody of Workers, a Confederation, and a Deputation to Choose in the\r\norganisation of our public life, I will not here treat. The vast\r\nmachinery of self-government, passionately interesting as it must be to\r\nall free men, would take me too far from the purpose of my narrative.\r\nIt must be enough for the reader to know that five gentlemen and\r\none lady, of very different complexions, garb and demeanours, sat\r\nin a semicircle on six Windsor chairs, in the schoolroom which Mr.\r\nClutterbuck entered. He was suffering--oh! suffering with the pangs men\r\nonly experience upon reaching the turning-points of their lives. Upon\r\nthis jury depended, not even his entry into the great council of the\r\nnation, but his bare opportunity for presenting himself as a candidate\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nThe chairman, or at any rate the gentleman who sat in the middle of\r\nthe crescent, was a clergyman of gigantic stature, though of what\r\ndenomination it would have been difficult to say, for above a Roman\r\ncollar he carried an immense black beard, wore spectacles, and was\r\nbald. His voice was perhaps the most profound and awe-inspiring Mr.\r\nClutterbuck had ever heard, and when he said, \"Pray, gentlemen, be\r\nseated,\" it was as though a judge had pronounced sentence in the\r\nweightiest of criminal trials.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck felt uncertainly backwards for the chair which he hoped\r\nwas there, found the target and expected the issue in an attitude of\r\nmisfortune. Charlie Fitzgerald sat down upon the chair next him, smiled\r\nat the half-moon of faces, and threw up his trenches to receive the\r\nattack.\r\n\r\n\"The first thing we have to ask you, Mr. Clutterbuck,\" boomed out the\r\nterrible hierarch, \"is your attitude upon the Irish question?\"\r\n\r\n\"My attitude upon the Irish question,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck, in a dry,\r\nunnatural voice, \"is that of the great Mr. Gladstone.\"\r\n\r\nFour of the male heads approved of this reply by various expressions\r\nand signs, and the lady by a series of enthusiastic little nods,\r\nintended to reassure the candidate whose embarrassment she sincerely\r\npitied.\r\n\r\nBut a man of apparently captious temper at the end of the line, said:\r\n\r\n\"Ah, now, but at what periud of the old djentlemun?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck, recognising the accent, replied eagerly, \"At the\r\nperiod most closely associated with his name.\"\r\n\r\n\"That won't do f'r my boys,\" said the interrupter cheerfully, \"n'r f'r\r\nanny uv the Orange Temperance League that _I_ know, I can tell ye!\"\r\n\r\nAnd this was Mr. Clutterbuck's first introduction to the great truth\r\nthat practical politics depend on compromise.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman bestowed a sorrowful look upon the gentleman from Ulster,\r\nand said severely:\r\n\r\n\"I _think_, Mr. Clutterbuck, most of us are satisfied with your reply.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck was grateful; he waited for the next question and\r\nbraced himself to bear it. It was the lady who put it to him in a voice\r\nwhich some years earlier must have been a beautiful contralto, and\r\nwhich even yet retained notes of singular richness and power. She asked\r\nMr. Clutterbuck in a manner suggesting persuasion rather than pressure,\r\nwhat his views might be upon the establishment of female courts of\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck replied that in this, as in every other matter\r\nconcerning the sex, he should be guided by the opinion of the committee\r\nrepresenting the lady electors.\r\n\r\n\"But I am here to represent the _Female_ Committee,\" said the lady\r\nsweetly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Ma'am,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck, \"ahem! I suppose you represent\r\ntheir views?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said the lady with decision and in her richest tones.\r\n\r\n\"Quite so, quite so,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck.\r\n\r\nAt this point Charlie Fitzgerald looked up and said quietly:\r\n\r\n\"I can assure you Mr. Clutterbuck is heartily in favour.\"\r\n\r\nHis interruption was not very palatable to the committee, who found it\r\na diversion from the pleasures of the chase. The chairman frowned at\r\nhim, and Charlie Fitzgerald smiled back sadly in return.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Clutterbuck,\" came forth the deep voice again, \"I have now to ask\r\nyou the gravest question of all: How would you vote in the matter of\r\ntemperance reform?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Clutterbuck,\" said Charlie Fitzgerald briskly, \"is a total\r\nabstainer.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are not here, sir,\" said a barber who had not yet spoken, and who\r\nwas a deeply religious man, \"to hear you, but to hear Mr. Clutterbuck.\"\r\n\r\nTo which rebuke Charlie Fitzgerald had the imprudence to murmur in a\r\nlow tone: \"Oh, my God!\"\r\n\r\nLuckily the expression did not reach the stern half-moon of\r\ninquisitors, and Mr. Clutterbuck was free to reply that he had the most\r\nardent and complete sympathy with temperance reform in all its aspects.\r\n\r\n\"But to take a specific instance,\" said the clergyman, wagging a\r\nforefinger at Mr. Clutterbuck and fixing him with his two glass eyes,\r\n\"would you or would you not vote for Sir William Cattermole's Bill?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would vote for it,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck in a tone of ardent\r\nconviction, \"though it should cost me my seat and the confidence of my\r\nparty!\"\r\n\r\nA look of blank amazement passed over the clergyman's face, nor did any\r\nof the half circle smile, except the Orangeman, and he only with his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\"You surely cannot have heard me aright,\" said the clergyman in\r\nastonishment and sorrow. \"I said Sir William Cattermole's Bill. You\r\nwould support that infamous measure?\"\r\n\r\nCharlie Fitzgerald was in a qualm, and it cannot be denied that Mr.\r\nClutterbuck looked at him for aid and information. Like most honest\r\nmen, Mr. Clutterbuck was not very ready to take hints or to observe\r\nexpressions, but Charlie Fitzgerald's eyebrows were so unmistakable\r\nthat he found his cue.\r\n\r\n\"You must have misunderstood me,\" he said. \"My point was that I\r\nwould vote for an amendment to that Bill though it should cost me my\r\nseat--that is,\" he added modestly, \"supposing I had one.\"\r\n\r\nAfter using this expression Mr. Clutterbuck was so miserable that the\r\nvery publicans themselves would have pitied him had they seen the sweat\r\ngathering upon his temples, and the droop of his mouth which at every\r\nmoment more and more resembled that of a child who is about to burst\r\ninto tears.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Clutterbuck,\" said the chairman with a sigh, \"that's not\r\nvery satisfactory.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it izunt,\" said the Orangeman offensively, though in a lower tone;\r\nwhile the lady, who had hitherto befriended the forlorn financier, now\r\nregarded him with a constrained reproach.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid,\" stammered the unfortunate man, \"that I must have\r\nexpressed myself ill.\"\r\n\r\n\"No matter, Mr. Clutterbuck, no matter,\" said the chairman, lifting his\r\nhand benignly. \"The time will come for all that, when this deplorable\r\nmeasure comes, if it ever does come, before the House.... And now, Mr.\r\nClutterbuck,\" he added leaning forward, to the evident annoyance of\r\nhis colleagues who desired to have a word, \"what about the policy of\r\nOffences Disfranchisement?\"\r\n\r\nTo the immense surprise of his six torturers, Mr. Clutterbuck, in a\r\nmanly and decisive voice replied, or rather shouted:\r\n\r\n\"I will have nothing to do with it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ear-ear!\" said the barber enthusiastically.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Pickle,\" said the clergyman reprovingly, \"your interruption is\r\nmost improper.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the sentiment's all right,\" said a little man to the left of the\r\nchair, who had not yet spoken, and whose wizened face betrayed acute\r\nintelligence. He added: \"And I con-gratulate you, Mr. Clutterbuck.\r\nYou're a gentleman! What's more is _this_; I shall be happy to shake\r\nyou heartily by the hand when all o' this is over.\"\r\n\r\nThe lady on the extreme left wing was visibly annoyed, the clergyman\r\nappeared indifferent, while the one member of the executive who had\r\nhitherto maintained a complete silence, and who yet was no less a\r\nperson than the husband of the representative of the female committee\r\nof Mickleton, copied his wife's demeanour with that exactitude which is\r\nthe outward symbol of a happy union. They had no children.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck, in a tone still strong, but with something of the\r\nmonotony which comes from frequent repetition, added:\r\n\r\n\"There are some things, gentlemen, on which a Democrat cannot swerve,\r\nand I cannot see, with due deference to the mixed opinion before me,\r\nhow a Democrat could have answered other than I did.\"\r\n\r\nHere doubts of grammar rushed into his mind and he was silent.\r\n\r\nThe wizened little man said: \"That's all roight,\" and the barber beamed\r\nat him.\r\n\r\nThe clergyman, rising, said:\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Clutterbuck, you've done us a great honour by meeting us,\r\nI'm sure.... We shall have to consider our decision. We will let you\r\nknow, Mr. Clutterbuck. May I have the honour and the pleasure of\r\nshaking you by the hand?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck accorded him this felicity, and repeated it in the\r\ncase of every other member of the crescent; they had now broken their\r\nformation and were standing in various attitudes before him, the lady\r\nwith a notable pride which became her female representative position,\r\nher husband with an extremely quiet dignity. The ordeal was over.\r\n\r\nAs Charlie Fitzgerald and he went out past the elephant and the dead\r\nstove into the open air, and when they were well out of earshot, Mr.\r\nClutterbuck asked nervously:\r\n\r\n\"Was that all right, Mr. Fitzgerald?\"\r\n\r\nFor answer Fitzgerald felt in his breast pocket, looked really anxious\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\"Good God! I forgot to post that letter.\"\r\n\r\n\"What letter?\" asked Mr. Clutterbuck, a little pale.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" said Fitzgerald, \"nothing.\" He walked quickly to a\r\npillar-box a few steps off, and dropped into it the envelope addressed\r\nto the United Sons of Endeavour which he should have posted the night\r\nbefore: his omission accounted for much, but he had rectified it and he\r\nknew that all would be well.\r\n\r\n\"It's all right,\" he said, slogging back, \"but I was a big fool to\r\nforget it. That's the worst of being an Irishman,\" he added genially.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck was quite at sea. \"But is it all _right_, Mr.\r\nFitzgerald?\" he insisted.\r\n\r\n\"It's all right _now_,\" said Fitzgerald. He hit his employer fairly in\r\nthe back, jumped into the car and shouted for home.\r\n\r\nFour days after a letter came to Caterham from the Acting Secretary of\r\nthe Mickleton National Executive Deputation to choose.\r\n\r\nIt spoke in warm terms of Mr. Clutterbuck's character and genius,\r\nadmitted differences of opinion upon more than one point and severely\r\ninformed him at its close that he was admitted to the full title of\r\nProspective National Candidate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the height of that splendid London season which had seen Mr.\r\nClutterbuck's introduction to Mrs. Smith's delightful circle, a little\r\nthing had happened at Podger's Wharf in the neighbourhood of Nine Elms\r\nupon the south side of the river.\r\n\r\nA gentleman of the name of Peake employed by Messrs. Harman and James,\r\nbarge and transport masters, to pump and swab out the bilge of the\r\n\"Queen of Denmark,\" certified to carry 182 tons of merchandise, and of\r\ndue cubic capacity for that burthen, discovered himself unable to reach\r\nthe vessel on account of the intervening mud and the accident of an\r\nexceptionally low tide.\r\n\r\nAt twelve o'clock the new and well-appointed hooter of Messrs. Harman\r\nand James's works having sounded, Mr. Peake immediately laid down the\r\nmop and hand-pump with which he had been furnished, and proceeded to\r\npass the check door and receive his salary, for it was a Saturday. The\r\nday was very sunny and bright--but that is not to my purpose.\r\n\r\nMr. Harman himself approached Mr. Peake and suggested to him that\r\nnow the tide was rising he might gratify the firm by remaining at an\r\nincreased salary for a couple of hours to accomplish his task; but Mr.\r\nPeake pointed out with such brevity as the occasion demanded that this\r\nwould be a gross violation of the rules of his Union, and moved towards\r\nthe gate.\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment that Mr. Harman committed the deplorable error\r\nwhich was to lead to such enormous consequences in the body politic:\r\nhe lost his temper. He was alleged, I know not with how much truth,\r\nto have addressed Mr. Peake in terms vividly suggesting social\r\ninferiority; but whether this be true or not it is certain that he\r\nassured Mr. Peake of the uselessness of seeking further employment at\r\nthe wharf; nay, he had the brutality to tender to that gentleman a\r\nweek's salary in lieu of notice, and having done so he retired.\r\n\r\nI will not here go into the vexed question of the language used on\r\neither side, nor enter into Mr. Harman's somewhat lame excuses that\r\nhe was provoked by a certain expression of his employee's which cast\r\na most unjust reflection upon his, Mr. Harman's, pride of birth and\r\npersonal morals. Mr. Harman's hasty action was surely indefensible upon\r\nany provocation, and its natural consequence was that the remainder of\r\nthose who worked at Podger's Wharf were called out by their Union,\r\nwhile the United Riverside Workers and Sons of Southwark threatened\r\na sympathetic cessation of labour to extend from the eastern side of\r\nHammersmith Bridge to the western edge of the steps at the bottom of\r\nEdgar Street in Limehouse.\r\n\r\nI need hardly say that under these circumstances the compulsory clauses\r\nof the Conciliation Act of 1909 were at once acted upon by the popular\r\nand wealthy President of the Board of Trade, and the decision of the\r\ncourts, the machinery of which in such actions is extraordinarily\r\nrapid, was given within three days entirely in favour of the Union;\r\nindeed, no other decision could possibly have been arrived at, and\r\npublic opinion thoroughly justified the coercion very properly applied\r\nto the tyrannical master; papers as different as the _Spectator_ and\r\nthe _Winning Post_ were at one upon the matter, and their widely\r\nseparate reading publics heartily agreed.\r\n\r\nSo far the incident, though it had attained certain dimensions, did\r\nnot threaten any very grave results. But it so happened that a section\r\nof the workers involved, namely, the Paint Removers and Tar and Marine\r\nComposition Appliers had taken advantage of the disturbance to demand\r\nthe abolition of piecework upon all hulks and upon all vessels in\r\nactive use between the Garboard Strake and the North Atlantic Winter\r\nLoading Line. The courts, in their haste to settle the main issue, had\r\nperhaps too lightly overlooked this contention, and the result was\r\nsome considerable disappointment among the Paint Removers and Tar and\r\nMarine Composition Appliers throughout the Port of London. The Union,\r\nas it was bound to do by statute, accepted the decision of the court;\r\nunfortunately a gentleman of the name of Fishmonger, in company with\r\nhis brother-in-law, Henry Bebb (hereinforth and henceforward known as\r\n\"Another\"), both expert Tar Smoothers, felt so strongly upon the matter\r\nthat they refused to return to work. A warrant was made out for their\r\narrest, and though their Union was somewhat half-hearted in the matter,\r\nthe P.D.Q. and several other societies desired to fight it, and under\r\nthe powers afforded by the same statute they lodged an appeal--for, as\r\nis now well known, there are certain cases in which a workman cannot be\r\ncompelled to accept employment even after the Court of Conciliation has\r\ndelivered its judgment.\r\n\r\nThe appeal was heard before Justices Hunnybubble, Compton and Welsh.\r\nSir John Compton was averse to create a precedent of such lamentable\r\nconsequence; the Act was new, it was, so to speak, upon its trial,\r\nand though he would have been the first to admit that he was there\r\nnot to make the law but to administer it, he could not but recognise\r\nthe function of an English judge in the commonwealth, and he was for\r\nfinding some issue by which Mr. Fishmonger and Mr. Bebb might escape\r\nthe too drastic consequences of a somewhat hastily drafted measure.\r\n\r\nWe are not a logical people: we refuse to be bound by the formal\r\nsyllogisms so popular with the lower races of Europe and especially\r\namong the dying Latin nations. There is no doubt that Mr. Justice\r\nCompton reflected, in the attitude he adopted, the permanent common\r\nsense of the nation. Unfortunately, Mr. Justice Hunnybubble, in spite\r\nof the sterling Saxon name he bore, was too much of the lawyer and the\r\npedant to concur. In his long and disastrous decision he introduced a\r\nhundred empty abstractions and metaphysical whimsies: that \"contract\r\nwas mutual,\" for instance, or that \"the obligation was binding upon\r\neither party.\" He even descended to talking of \"equality,\" declared the\r\nlaw as much the defender of the rich man as of the poor, and would\r\nnot admit, in theory, that contrast between Employer and Employed,\r\nwhich is so glaring in practice to every eye. He insisted that if the\r\nmaster was constrained to take a workman back, so was that workman\r\nbound to return; he so strained the petty details of the Act itself\r\nas to interpret the words \"all parties\" in clause IV. to include the\r\nemployees as well as the employers, and applied the phrase \"shall abide\r\nby the award under pain, &c.,\" to hungry artisan as severely as to\r\npaunchy capitalist.\r\n\r\nIn spite of Sir John Compton's dissent, Mr. Justice Hunnybubble took\r\nwith him his colleague, Welch. The decision of the lower court was\r\ntherefore upheld, and Mr. Fishmonger and Mr. Bebb, who had found better\r\npaid employment in the Halls during the Long Vacation, and who refused\r\nto re-enter the yard, were, to the shame of our institutions, cast into\r\nHolloway Jail as first class misdemeanants. They were deprived of the\r\nuse of tobacco and the daily newspapers; and even their cuisine was\r\nregulated by official order.\r\n\r\nWhile the case was still _sub judice_ the respect invariably shown to\r\nthe courts forbade any open comment, but when, some ten days after Mr.\r\nClutterbuck's interview with the executive of Mickleton, the deplorable\r\nmiscarriage of justice had actually taken place, and when the populace\r\nhad been afforded the spectacle of these two unfortunate men driven in\r\na common cab to their dungeon, the storm burst.\r\n\r\nThe general emotion did not at first find its way into the public\r\nPress: the proprietors of our daily and weekly journals have too strong\r\na regard for the Bench to permit themselves any immediate criticism\r\nof a judicial decision, and the relations into which they are nightly\r\nbrought with our judges as host or guest in many a hospitable house,\r\nadds to their natural reserve; but in spite of this absence of printed\r\ncomment, the matter became first the chief, and at last the only\r\nsubject of talk among the artisans of the metropolis, from them it\r\nspread, as all such movements must, to the unskilled labourers, and\r\nfrom these to the general population of London. Within a fortnight\r\nthe police were aware of the extraordinary extent of the ferment, and\r\nthe Home Secretary went so far as to curtail a pleasant visit at the\r\ncountry seat of the Baron de Czernwitz, in order to hurry up to town\r\nand consult with his brother-in-law, the Lord Chief Justice, and his\r\nwife's uncle, the Chief Commissioner. His decision was to do nothing:\r\nbut meanwhile two public meetings had been held, one in Moore's Circus,\r\nanother an open-air one, on Peckham Rye, and feeling had risen so high\r\nthat two newspapers actually admitted short reports of the proceedings\r\nat each of these gatherings.\r\n\r\nEarly in November, while matters were in this very critical state, the\r\nsitting member for Mickleton whose financial entanglement could no\r\nlonger be concealed, fled to Ostend and was rash enough to take his\r\nlife in the front room of the Villa des Charmettes, thereby leaving a\r\nvacancy in the representation of his borough.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck's easy prospect of nursing Mickleton, of carefully and\r\ncontinuously supporting its worthier activities, and of extending a\r\njudicious hospitality to its many inhabitants, was suddenly shattered:\r\nhe must prepare for instant action. It was with a mixture of fixed\r\nconcern and unpleasant excitement that, under the direction of Charlie\r\nFitzgerald, his plans were made.\r\n\r\nThe writ, it was understood, would be issued on the following Wednesday\r\nweek, and the polling would take place upon Saturday, November 19;\r\nthere was little time to lose. The dates and places of the principal\r\nmeetings were rapidly arranged, the printers among whom work was to\r\nbe distributed were carefully noted, the excellent organisation of\r\nthe constituency had prepared him a numbered list of the electors who\r\nwould expect a personal visit, and he received one morning by post the\r\nmanifesto which had been drawn up at headquarters for him to sign.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck had signed this in his businesslike way and had left it\r\nfor his secretary to post.\r\n\r\nThat gentleman came in from his usual morning spin in the green\r\nDarracq--the Napier he had slightly damaged some days before in\r\nattempting a group of oxen on Merstham hill. As he slowly mastered\r\nthe few lines he began to shake his head solemnly and at last laid the\r\ndocument down, saying:\r\n\r\n\"It won't do as it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't want me to add to it myself, Mr. Fitzgerald?\" said Mr.\r\nClutterbuck with an anxious look.\r\n\r\n\"N--no,\" said Fitzgerald, running his finger down the page.... \"My\r\npoint is ... there's something you got to add.\"\r\n\r\nHe read it again more closely, knitting his brows.\r\n\r\nIt was a straightforward bit of democratic pleading and clear, popular\r\nstatement. It emphasised the importance to Great Britain of raising\r\nthe price of Consols up to a standard level of seventy-five, of\r\nmaintaining and if possible increasing the gold reserve so that the\r\nBank rate should not rise above six per cent. for more than three\r\nmonths at one time; it declared strongly for the principle of female\r\ncourts of justice, and supported the policy of the Government in its\r\nrecent subsidies to the Grimsby fishing industry, the White Star Line,\r\nthe Small Holders Capitalisation Association, the new \"Eastern Counties\r\nRailway,\" and Lord Painton's Association for the Construction and\r\nRepair of English Canals.\r\n\r\nUpon lesser matters it turned to criticise the woeful parsimony of the\r\nlate administration, and contrasted the provision made for the fleet in\r\nthe last National Budget with the Naval Estimates of 1908.\r\n\r\nThe document ended with a paragraph upon the Offences Disfranchisement\r\nBill, which Charlie Fitzgerald read with close attention. It was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"_In my opinion those who have borne themselves so ill as to merit\r\ncondemnation by one of our English justices of the peace, whether to\r\nfine or imprisonment, or both, are certainly worthy of some measure\r\nof loss of the powers of the fulness of complete and unrestricted\r\ncitizenship; but I shall reserve my judgment upon the present\r\nGovernment's decision to withdraw the franchise for five years, or\r\nin some cases in perpetuity, from those who have done no more than\r\nto excite such grave suspicion as must attach to those who have been\r\narrested by the police or have been present as defendants in a county\r\ncourt._\"\r\n\r\nFitzgerald read this sentence three times over, and sighed. \"Too many\r\n'ofs',\" he murmured, \"too many words!... Did you _notice_ that last\r\nparagraph?\" he added without looking up at his employer.\r\n\r\n\"I really can't say, Mr. Fitzgerald,\" answered that gentleman moving\r\nabout somewhat uneasily. \"I can't tell you, quoted offhand like that.\r\nWhat's it about?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it _seems_ to be about the Offences Disfranchisement Bill, but\r\nGod only knows who drafted it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who--what?\" said Mr. Clutterbuck still more uneasily, coming and\r\nlooking over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Who wrote it out,\" said Fitzgerald, \"who designed the beastly thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Really, Mr. Fitzgerald, really,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck. He had not\r\nhimself written the fatal words, but he had carried on a little\r\ncorrespondence of his own about them, and he did not like the work to\r\nbe treated so sharply, though his respect for Charlie Fitzgerald was\r\nstill strong.\r\n\r\n\"It's got to go,\" said Fitzgerald decisively.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Mr. Fitzgerald!\" said Mr. Clutterbuck in some alarm, \"we can't do\r\nwithout an allusion to the Offences Bill! Really, Mr. Fitzgerald, you\r\nknow it's the most important reform, well, of our time so to speak.\r\nWhy,\" said he, remembering sundry quotations from his reading: \"this\r\ncountry is the pioneer; Italy's only talked of the thing; Germany's\r\nbackward. There's only Nebraska abreast of us. And think of the effect!\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" said Charlie Fitzgerald a little impatiently, \"_that_\r\nparagraph has got to go. If you want to say anything about the Offences\r\nDisfranchisement Bill you had better put in four lines saying that\r\nwild horses won't make you vote for it in any shape or form. But I\r\ndoubt whether those old jossers in Mickleton would pass that. Just say\r\nnothing about it, and a day or two before the poll enlarge your spirit\r\non the platform and damn it up hill and down dale.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck felt like a man who had just lost his dog, but he held\r\nhis tongue, and only thought mournfully of the letters that might come\r\nto him next day.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" said Charlie Fitzgerald as he drew a red chalk thoughtfully\r\nthrough the offending paragraph, \"I'm going off this evening, and when\r\nI come back I shall tell you what I _think_ ought to be added at the\r\nend of the manifesto--I shall know then.\"\r\n\r\nHe got up quite suddenly. \"I won't be late,\" he added. \"I'll be back\r\nbefore midnight, and I'll tell you.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck and he looked at each other without speaking for a\r\nmoment, and for once there was a slight disturbance in the merchant's\r\nmind as he looked through the window and saw his secretary calmly\r\ngiving orders to the gardener and to the mechanician, and a moment\r\nlater stepping into the newly-bought F.I.A.T. with a gesture of\r\nproprietorship that was perhaps a trifle exaggerated.\r\n\r\nBut this unworthy mood disturbed for but a moment the Clutterbuckian\r\npoise, and certainly his young friend's achievement, when he returned\r\nto tell of it, would have dispelled for ever any such ill-omened\r\nemotion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe business which Mr. Fitzgerald had before him that evening was\r\none so familiar to all those acquainted with the apparatus of\r\nself-government, that it is perhaps redundant in me to chronicle it.\r\nNevertheless it was of such importance in the events that follow, that\r\nI must briefly relate it.\r\n\r\nHe drove to the station and sent the car back (its reappearance was a\r\nfirst solace to the master of the house); he took, out of the petty\r\ncash, a first return for Victoria, hailed a cab as he left the station\r\n(noting the expense with a regularity rare in a man of high birth and\r\nIrish nationality), drove to his Club, dined handsomely, again put down\r\nthis incidental item in round figures, hailed yet another cab, and told\r\nthe driver vaguely to drive to Mickleton.\r\n\r\nThe driver, a North countryman of sturdy temper, insisted upon knowing\r\nan exact address, but upon receiving a reply which savoured too much\r\nof carelessness about The Future Life, he whipped up his horse and\r\ndrove northward as he was bid, taking, as is the invariable custom\r\nof hackney coachmen, the largest and the widest artery of the place,\r\na street known for some centuries as the London Road, called during\r\nthe eighties and nineties The Boulevard, but since the feat of arms\r\nof General Baden-Powell, characteristically and finally christened\r\nMafeking Avenue.\r\n\r\nIn this fine thoroughfare were to be discovered not a few licensed\r\npremises. Charlie Fitzgerald chose the most sumptuous of these and\r\nthe best lit, stopped the cab and went in. He was about to explore the\r\npublic opinion of Mickleton.\r\n\r\nHe came out in a quarter of an hour, drove on to another public-house,\r\nvisited it for a few minutes only, called at another and another, and\r\nso until he had fairly sampled the constituents in perhaps a dozen of\r\nthose general rendezvous where the political temper of a great people\r\nmay best be determined. The result of his investigation was much what\r\nhe had expected, though it was more precise, and in one matter much\r\nmore emphatic, than he would have premised before he began his inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe populace were, as he had expected, indifferent to, and for the\r\ngreater part ignorant of, the death of their respected member. Those of\r\nthem who were acquainted with his demise found it difficult to keep an\r\naudience, and the few who had attempted to retail it as an entertaining\r\nitem of news, were met by the coarsest of opposition, save in the case\r\nof one man, who ascribed it with conviction to murder at the hands of\r\nthe police, pointing out to his companion at \"The Naked Man\" how many\r\ncases of such mysterious deaths had recently occurred on the Opposition\r\nside of the House, and drawing from his own rich experience of the\r\nconstabulary many dark examples of their mysterious power.\r\n\r\nBut while the death of the late baronet was found to have produced so\r\nlittle impression, one topic struck Fitzgerald's ears upon every side,\r\nand this, I need hardly say, was the case of Rex v. Fishmonger and\r\nAnother.\r\n\r\nThe full legal terminology was unfamiliar to these plain working men,\r\nand they alluded to it commonly as \"the Nine Elms business,\" or the\r\n\"Podger's Lay\" to which the more familiar would add the term, \"the\r\nHolloway job.\" But unvarnished and even inaccurate as were their\r\nexpressions, it was clear that they were deeply moved. Save here and\r\nthere in the saloon bars, where the local gentry would meet in rarer\r\nnumbers, and where Fitzgerald during this tour had little concern,\r\nnothing else was talked of: most significant of all, as he rightly\r\njudged, was the ardent sympathy of the potboys, the barmaids, and the\r\nvery publicans themselves, who, for all their substantial position as\r\nemployers of labour, could not conceal their ardent agreement with\r\ntheir customers.\r\n\r\nA foreigner unacquainted with the national temper, and hearing\r\nthe popular judgments passed upon Mr. Justice Hunnybubble, might\r\nhave imagined that exalted personage's life to be in danger, and\r\nin more than one instance Charlie Fitzgerald was annoyed to have a\r\nglass smashed under his nose in the heat of the denunciations, or\r\nto find some huge and purple visage, one with which he was totally\r\nunacquainted, angrily challenging him to agree with the general verdict\r\nor to take Toko. With true diplomacy Fitzgerald joined heartily in the\r\nuniversal topic and opinion, but his clothes and accent laid him open\r\nto a just suspicion, and he was glad when his round of visits was over\r\nand his mind thoroughly informed.\r\n\r\nIt is not an easy thing to conduct such a piece of research after\r\ndinner in a dozen public-houses large and small, and to retain one's\r\nclarity of vision and one's acuteness of judgment. But Fitzgerald, by\r\nthe simple manœuvre of ordering the whiskey and the water separately,\r\nand of ultimately standing the former to a chance acquaintance in each\r\nplace, accomplished his mission with complete success. As he took the\r\nlast train at Victoria, after discharging the cabman with an ample\r\nreward (which he again noted in round figures), he had the campaign\r\nwell in hand.\r\n\r\nThat night, late as it was, he found Mr. Clutterbuck waiting for him,\r\nand, what is more, Mrs. Clutterbuck as well. He manfully stood out\r\none hour of earnest defence against her continued presence, and when,\r\nnot without a promise of vengeance in her eye she had determined to\r\nretreat, he tackled Mr. Clutterbuck at once, and told him that the\r\nconstituency was his upon one condition.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck, who seriously feared that the condition would involve\r\nyet another generous recognition of The Sons of Endeavour, was relieved\r\nbeyond measure to hear that no more was required of him than a strong\r\nand simple declaration such as behoved a Democrat upon a plain matter\r\nof public policy.\r\n\r\n\"You got to speak heart and soul for Fishmonger--and for the Other\r\nalso, I suppose,\" said Charlie Fitzgerald. \"If you think you dare do\r\nit, go for Hunnybubble, and do as little as you can of anything else.\r\nThat's the tip,\" said Fitzgerald, bringing his hands together with a\r\nhearty clap like a pistol shot, and mentally calculating his total\r\nexpenses of the evening, with ten shillings added for a margin.\r\n\r\nIt was all Greek to Mr. Clutterbuck, but he understood it was politics.\r\nTo a man of his frankness and probity political work was clear, and--so\r\nthat it were political work and contained no hint of corruption--he was\r\nready for the fray.\r\n\r\nOf the elements of the matter he could only remember vaguely the\r\nword Fishmonger tucked away in small type in the legal columns of\r\nthe _Times_, while for Mr. Justice Hunnybubble he had never felt any\r\nfeeling more precise than the deference due to a man who was gratefully\r\nremembered by the social class to which Mr. Clutterbuck belonged as\r\n\"Hanging Jim.\"\r\n\r\nThe hour was too late for him to follow further argument. It was not\r\ntill next morning that his strategy was laid down for him by his\r\ninvaluable secretary.\r\n\r\nThe manifesto was brought out again, the last objectionable paragraph\r\nwas cut out, and in its place Charlie Fitzgerald added these ringing\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n  \"MUCH MORE THAN ANY PASSING QUESTION OF POLITICS I SHALL CHALLENGE,\r\n  IF YOU RETURN ME AS YOUR MEMBER, THE HIDEOUS INJUSTICE AND TYRANNY\r\n  WHICH HAS CONDEMNED TWO BRITISH WORKMEN TO LANGUISH IN JAIL FOR\r\n  EXERCISING THE COMMON RIGHTS OF EVERY FREE MAN. AND I SHALL LEAVE NO\r\n  STONE UNTURNED TO SECURE THE REVERSAL OF THAT INIQUITOUS JUDGMENT.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Charlie Fitzgerald pleasantly, when he had drafted this\r\nbugle call, \"we won't send that back to your agents, will we?\" He\r\naccompanied this unexpected remark with a sunny smile, and Mr.\r\nClutterbuck looked at him blankly.\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" said Charlie Fitzgerald humorously, \"we'll note who the\r\nprinters are, shall we?\" He looked at the small type at the bottom of\r\nthe sheet and saw \"The Alexandra Printing Works.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm greatly relieved,\" he said, \"they're Opposition: they can't be\r\ngot at by our people.\" Then he wrote on a slip of paper: \"20,000 as\r\ncorrected. Please note caps in last paragraph. No need for revise.\r\nDeliver to address given. Hoardings as order. Immediate.\" He scribbled\r\nMr. Clutterbuck's initials as it was his secretarial duty to do. He\r\nfolded up the proof and the note, addressed the cover, and before Mr.\r\nClutterbuck fully seized what had happened, Fitzgerald had himself\r\ntaken it down to the pillar-box at the lodge and was back, cheerfully\r\ncontented.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure you know best, Mr. Fitzgerald,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck, though\r\nhe was not yet quite happy.\r\n\r\nFor answer Mr. Fitzgerald pulled out of his pocket an evening paper, in\r\nwhich was the account of a police charge in Mickleton itself, which had\r\nbroken up a monster meeting in favour of the condemned men.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck read the account carefully, and interlarded his reading\r\nwith repeated exclamations of wonder addressed apparently to the\r\nreporter of the scene.\r\n\r\nHe was next turning to read the opinions of the paper itself upon the\r\ntransaction, and would in a moment have discovered its disapproval of\r\nhis constituency's violence, when Fitzgerald asked for the sheet to be\r\ngiven back to him, and Mr. Clutterbuck at once complied. His mind was\r\nclear. The thing was in capitals, and would evidently be the point of\r\nthe election. He must get it up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck was right, and Charlie Fitzgerald had judged wisely.\r\n\r\nThe first meeting of the campaign was to be held in quite a little hall\r\nbelonging to the local ethical society. No interest had yet been taken\r\nin the election, the greater part of the constituency had perhaps but\r\njust heard of it--yet the whole evening turned upon Fishmonger and The\r\nOther.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck's fervid declaration was not enough: one man after\r\nanother at the back of the hall must take the opportunity, while\r\ncongratulating the candidate upon his attitude, to make a considerable\r\nharangue upon the awful pass to which English freedom had come.\r\nLeaflets, printed by the Relief Committee, were in the hands of more\r\nthan half the audience; and what was more interesting was to see\r\nhow, the moment the meeting was over, those who had asked questions\r\ndistributed themselves, as though according to orders, into the various\r\nquarters of the borough, visiting the public houses and spreading the\r\nnews of their candidate's declarations.\r\n\r\nThis was upon a Wednesday. On the Friday, for which the second meeting\r\nhad been announced, a much larger hall, the Cleethorpe Foundation\r\nSchools, was absolutely full before a quarter past seven, though the\r\nspeeches were not to begin until eight.\r\n\r\nThe audience filled the interval with songs concerning political and\r\neconomic liberty, and more than one ribald catch in contempt of the\r\nFishmonger judgment. The appearance of the platform did not silence\r\nthem. They sang with a vengeance as they awaited their candidate, and\r\nthe stout and elderly chairman, Mr. Alderman Thorpe, continually pulled\r\nout his watch in his nervousness, noted that the crowd of faces before\r\nhim were of quite a different sort from those repeated faces which\r\nperpetually appeared at the National meetings. The tone of their cries\r\nwas more violent than the Executive were accustomed to, and the spirit\r\nof the hall quite novel.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck at last appeared. It was unfortunate that he should\r\nbe ten minutes late, and the accident provoked not a few shouted\r\nqueries, but his appearance as he stalked on to the platform with\r\nCharlie Fitzgerald at his heels, called forth an indescribable volume\r\nof cheering, which lasted during the whole of the introducer's speech,\r\nand threatened to overlap into that of the candidate himself.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck was not an impromptu speaker; it was his custom to\r\nlearn by heart the remarks it was his duty to deliver, nor was he\r\nsuperior to obtaining a general draft or even a more detailed summary\r\nof those remarks from the Democratic Speech Agency upon Holborn\r\nViaduct. That evening, however, his heart spoke for him, and he could\r\nnot forbear repeating some dozen times, when silence was restored,\r\n\"Upon my word, gentlemen, I am highly flattered--I am highly flattered,\r\nI am very highly flattered, indeed!\"\r\n\r\nHe cleared his throat and began the first set speech of the campaign.\r\nHe knew it by heart; it was therefore in a clear if somewhat high\r\npitched voice that he delivered the opening phrase \"the effect of free\r\ntrade in the past upon\"--he was interrupted by another wild burst of\r\ncheering and loud applause from the vast audience, who imagined him to\r\nrefer to the incarcerated Fishmonger and whose thousand hearts were\r\nbeating as one.\r\n\r\nIt was so throughout the carefully worded address. His allusion to the\r\ntaxation of rice produced the chorus of a popular song in favour of\r\nthe men languishing in Holloway, and his passing remarks upon Consols\r\n\"which, as a City man he assured them were a matter to him of the very\r\ngravest concern,\" led to repeated cries of \"Drown old Harman!\" and\r\nenthusiastic hurrahs for their candidate's championship of the doomed\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Clutterbuck sat down, in some confusion but in great\r\nhappiness, and when the customary vote of thanks had been given, a\r\ngenial publican in the body of the hall who had never attended a public\r\nmeeting save to protest against the unhappy Licensing Bill of 1908,\r\nrose most unexpectedly to support the resolution. In a voice full of\r\nnutriment and good humour, he assured the candidate, amid repeated\r\nconfirmations from all around, that in spite of his attitude upon\r\ntemperance--and no one saw more of the evils of _in_temperance than the\r\nlicensed victualler--in spite of that, Mr. Clutterbuck's manly attitude\r\non the case of Rex _v._ Fishmonger and Another would secure him the\r\nsupport of the trade.\r\n\r\nA clergyman, who had had the temerity to rise with the intention of\r\ncongratulating the candidate, was imagined from his pale face and\r\nrefined voice to be an opponent: he was angrily silenced, and the\r\nmeeting dispersed with loud cheers for his present Majesty, for the\r\narmed servants of the Crown whether military or naval, and--need it be\r\ntold?--for Fishmonger over all.\r\n\r\nIt was evidently an election to be taken on the fly and to be run\r\nbefore the machine slowed down. The common National literature sent\r\nout from the head offices in Peter Street was soon absorbed. Charlie\r\nFitzgerald implored them for matter upon Fishmonger, but the official\r\npress refused. He could not brave the Act nor exceed the statutory\r\nlimit of expense, but Mr. Clutterbuck was delighted to find that the\r\nFishmonger Relief Committee--to which his wife, his brother-in-law,\r\nand even his coachman very largely subscribed--would furnish him with\r\nendless tracts and posters. The walls were covered by this independent\r\nally, and the expenditure upon its part of over four thousand pounds\r\nassociated Mr. Clutterbuck's name with the relief of the poor prisoners\r\nin letters six, ten and fifteen feet high and in the most astounding\r\ncolours.\r\n\r\nThere were pictures also: pictures by the ton. Pictures of Mr.\r\nClutterbuck striking the fetters from Fishmonger's wrists; pictures of\r\nFishmonger in convict garb sleeping his troubled sleep upon a pallet\r\nof straw while a vision of the valiant Clutterbuck floated above\r\nhim in a happy cloud: this was called \"The Dream of Hope.\" Pictures\r\nof Fishmonger on the treadmill pitied by an indignant Britannia\r\nand a Clutterbuck springing to his aid, inflamed the popular zeal,\r\nand further pictures of a black Demon cowering before an avenging\r\nClutterbuck in full armour afforded a parable of immense effect.\r\n\r\nAnd then there were speeches! Every day saw its meeting, and at the\r\nend of the first week its second or its third meeting within the\r\ntwenty-four hours. Mr. Clutterbuck, by whose side Mrs. Clutterbuck\r\noften sat in those wild and happy moments of popular fervour, was\r\npermitted no great length by his secretary, and a band of good fellows\r\nwho were determined to achieve the liberties of England, took care\r\nthat questions other than those provided them by the secretary or\r\nthe committee, should not be asked with impunity. It was even, as\r\nthe unhappy example of the clergyman had shown, unwise to express\r\nadhesion to Mr. Clutterbuck's candidature, unless this were done in\r\nso unmistakable a manner that there should be no room for popular\r\nhostility.\r\n\r\nSo ended the first week of the struggle; nor had Mr. Clutterbuck\r\nshowed a single fault save, in his confusion, an occasional lack of\r\npunctuality, which was certainly resented and noted more than he knew.\r\nHis throat was supple, his delivery clear, but he was a little doubtful\r\nwhether his enunciation was sufficiently vigorous to fill a large hall.\r\n\r\nSunday, I am glad to say, in spite of the woeful inroads Socialism has\r\nrecently made, was observed as a day of rest by either side; and Mr.\r\nClutterbuck took the opportunity of the holy season to summon to The\r\nPlâs, on Charlie Fitzgerald's advice and at an enormous expense, a\r\nVoice Producer, who, while complaining of the shortness of the time\r\nallowed him, guaranteed his client a considerable extension of vocal\r\npower if his rules were strictly observed.\r\n\r\nHe it was who for three hours upon that holy day elicited from Mr.\r\nClutterbuck at least one hundred times, a loud and increasing roar\r\nduring which he insisted that the head should be thrown back, the\r\nthroat widely opened and the mouth stretched to its fullest extent.\r\nHe it was who, insisted upon the regular use of the Hornsby lozenge,\r\nthough Mr. Clutterbuck had been persuaded by a friend to make secret\r\nuse of the Glarges type of emollient bonbon. He it was who taking Mr.\r\nClutterbuck after tea by the shoulders, pressed them back until, at the\r\nexpense of exquisite suffering to that elderly gentleman, he had caused\r\nthem to lock behind him. He it was who then compelled the merchant\r\nto fill his chest to its fullest extent, to retain his breath to the\r\nutmost of his capacity, and to emit, when he could hold it no longer,\r\nthe syllables\r\n\r\n  MAH-MUH-MOH-MAY-MYE-MEE-MO-MAH\r\n\r\nin the ascending notes of the octave; and he it was who almost rendered\r\nthe master of the house ridiculous by compelling him to run three or\r\nfour times round the building and never to cease a loud singsong\r\nduring his breathless course.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck could not but feel that the professional adviser had\r\nwell earned the twenty guineas with which he was rewarded; and if upon\r\nrising the next morning he found himself somewhat strained and hoarse,\r\nhe readily accepted Fitzgerald's assurance that his voice would return\r\nall the more strongly in the course of the day.\r\n\r\nThat Monday morning, the Monday preceding the poll, the first of the\r\nopen-air meetings was held in front of the Town Hall, and quite 4,000\r\npeople from every part of London, among whom were a number of the\r\nlocal electors themselves, must have listened to the short declaration\r\nin which Mr. Clutterbuck, now considerably fatigued, insisted, for\r\nthe twenty-seventh time, in terms with which they were now all too\r\nfamiliar, and in a voice increasingly raucous, upon the iniquity of the\r\njudgment he stood there to reverse, and upon the necessity of returning\r\nhim to Westminster in order to effect the necessary change in the law;\r\nindeed it cannot be denied that, as the election proceeded and the\r\nexcitement grew, Mr. Clutterbuck himself came greatly to exaggerate\r\nthe power of a private member in directing the course of British\r\nlegislation. The lengthy procedure of the House of Commons of which he\r\nhad but a hazy conception, dwindled in his imagination, and as for the\r\nHouse of Lords, he forgot it altogether.\r\n\r\nUpon the Tuesday a football match upon Mickleton Common naturally\r\nsuspended the vanity of speechmaking, and the day was given over to\r\nthat hard spadework by the canvassers upon which every election finally\r\ndepends. The canvassing was the more successful and the less arduous\r\nfrom the fact that the heads of families who were cheering upon the\r\nCommon the fortunes of the Mickleton Rousers, left the ladies at home\r\nto pledge the votes of the household, which they did with a complete\r\nfreedom to the emissaries of either candidate.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck, his wife, Fitzgerald, and Mr. Maple, the agent, went\r\nthe round all day till the candidate himself was fit to drop. At one\r\nplace they smiled and bowed at a little group of lads who replied with\r\nglares, at another they steadily worked half a street, only to find at\r\nlast that it was just outside the constituency. At a third, a seedy\r\nman, a most undoubted voter, who had been present at every meeting\r\napproached Mr. Clutterbuck and spoke a word in his ear.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck good-naturedly proffered half a sovereign; the coin\r\nhad barely changed hands when the agent--who had caught the gesture\r\nin the nick of time--pounced on the needy citizen and wrenched his\r\nfingers open by main force. The struggle was brief, and Mr. Maple--a\r\nman of stature and consequence--triumphantly returned the coin to the\r\ncandidate.\r\n\r\nWhether from the wrestling or some other emotion he was trembling as he\r\nreturned it.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Mr. Clutterbuck--Oh! It would have cost you your seat!\" he puffed\r\nout.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck was grateful indeed, but he heard for hours the echo\r\nof the angry borrower's blasphemy and his repeated vow to vote for\r\nthat fallen angel whom an older theology has regarded as the Enemy of\r\nMankind before he would vote National again.\r\n\r\nSo Tuesday ended--and here my duty compels me to introduce the\r\nrepugnant subject of the Opposition candidate, lest the reader should\r\nforget in the fever of enthusiasm which I have described, the very\r\npresence of a man who dared to set himself against the expressed\r\nopinion of The People.\r\n\r\nLord Henfield was his name. His hairs, which were of the palest yellow\r\nand few in number for a man of but thirty years, were parted down the\r\nmiddle with an extraordinary accuracy which was no more disturbed when\r\nhe appeared in the early morning after rising from repose than when in\r\nthe last hours of the night he would withdraw from the critical and\r\nangry audiences which he too often had to encounter.\r\n\r\nHis face was not clean-shaven: contrariwise, he wore long and drooping\r\nmoustaches of the same character and complexion as his hair, and\r\nforming a singular contrast with that virile grey crescent upon Mr.\r\nClutterbuck's upper lip, of which the reader has so often heard.\r\n\r\nHis eyes were of a very watery blue; he lisped a little, and such\r\ndecision as he may have possessed was only to be discovered in his\r\napparently complete indifference to the judgment of men poorer than\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThe deference due to his rank and wealth forbade any assault upon\r\nhis person; all other forms of opposition he met with a slight and\r\nrather mournful smile, and with the regret that there should be any\r\ndifferences between himself and those whom he hoped would soon prove to\r\nbe his constituents.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of his position was not, it may be admitted, entirely due\r\nto his personality nor even to the wild popularity which the cause of\r\nFishmonger and Another had recently acquired. Indeed he was as ardent a\r\nchampion of the incarcerated Fishmonger as was Mr. Clutterbuck himself,\r\nand differed from his opponent only in modifying his language where it\r\nmight have shocked the English sense of the respect which we all owe to\r\nthe Bench.\r\n\r\nHis principal ally in a struggle which seemed to disturb him so little\r\nwas his wife. Lady Henfield, a woman of the most captivating vitality,\r\ncalled at every house in the constituency, smiled, flattered, and joked\r\ninto friendship the hearts of all the women, and fearlessly bestowed\r\nupon either sex indifferently the marks of a warm appreciation which,\r\nfrom such a woman, are never thrown away. Many a household could tell,\r\nlong before the contest was engaged, of deeds of kindness which her\r\ngenuine sympathy with the populace forbade her to noise abroad, and\r\nher known influence upon the Board of Pleeson's Charity, a social work\r\nof immense importance in the neighbourhood, lent her a high and most\r\nlegitimate influence in all that she did in Mickleton. She had had\r\nthe sense to take a house for her husband in the locality, and though\r\nthey but rarely slept in this distant quarter of the metropolis, the\r\nexcellent way in which it was served and furnished naturally impressed\r\nher neighbours of every degree.\r\n\r\nAll this counteracted, to no slight extent, Lord Henfield's\r\ninsufficient performances upon the platform, and no one acquainted with\r\nelectoral campaigning will deny that the enthusiasm or disapproval of\r\npopular audiences counts little as compared with the domestic effect\r\nof private visits and of good deeds coming from the heart. To all\r\nthis was added on the Wednesday, a false step on the part of Mr.\r\nClutterbuck, which for the first time, and that so near the poll, was a\r\nserious setback to the tide in his favour. A gentleman of considerable\r\nmeans, a printer and dyer of the name of Stephens, who had frequently\r\nappeared upon Mr. Clutterbuck's platform and had seemed, even to\r\nthe keen eye of Charlie Fitzgerald, to be an inoffensive plutocrat,\r\ninsisted upon receiving the candidate and his wife as his guests at\r\nBongers End during the last days of the struggle.\r\n\r\n\"It will save your husband,\" he said to Mrs. Clutterbuck, \"those long\r\nnight journeys to Croydon which a man at his age cannot afford to\r\ndespise, and will give Mrs. Stephens and myself and my two sons and my\r\ndaughter Clara and Miss Curle the very greatest pride and pleasure.\"\r\n\r\nThis apparently innocuous proposal, which Mrs. Clutterbuck eagerly\r\naccepted for her husband, was a threefold error. A long-standing\r\nrivalry, or rather enmity, existed between their new host and a Mr.\r\nClay, whose engineering works were perhaps the most important industry\r\nin Mickleton, and who as a Tory Home Ruler of some years' standing, was\r\nnow naturally the head of the National Party since the establishment\r\nof a Parliament in Dublin and the framing of the new tariff had called\r\nthat party into existence. He bitterly resented the honour shown to\r\nhis rival, and it needed all the tact of Fitzgerald to prevent his\r\ninfluence being thrown into the wrong scale. But that tact was well\r\nexercised. Fitzgerald called upon Mr. Clay late at night, described\r\nMr. Clutterbuck's intense desire to have been the guest of Mr. Clay,\r\nhis hesitation to invite himself, the brutal forwardness of his\r\nrival, while the whole story was cemented by a description of blood\r\nrelationship between Mrs. Clutterbuck and Mrs. Stephens, which, in\r\nlater days, Fitzgerald himself did not hesitate to deny.\r\n\r\nTo lead the close of the campaign from Mr. Stephen's mansion at Bongers\r\nEnd was still more dangerous, from the fact that a quarrel had arisen\r\nbetween that gentleman and one of his workmen, whom indeed he had\r\nalmost dismissed: had the tragedy actually occurred, the situation\r\nwould have been not very different from the famous cause of the strike\r\nat Podger's Wharf, and the parallel was often drawn between the one\r\ncase and the other in the humbler homes of Mickleton. Finally, Mr.\r\nClutterbuck had not calculated, when he yielded to the warm pressure\r\nof his host, that his famous declaration upon total abstinence would\r\nthere be taken in its literal sense. The principles of the National\r\nParty--which had now for two years advocated voluntary abstinence as\r\nan alternative to predatory legislation against the trade--forbade\r\nMr. Clutterbuck to touch wine or spirits when he was actually present\r\nin the constituency, and he knew very well that if he were returned to\r\nthe House of Commons it would be necessary for him to take his meals in\r\nthe new rooms set apart for those who not only denied themselves the\r\nuse of such beverages, but had the stalwart manhood to forego so much\r\nas the sight of others who were causing Israel to sin. But he would\r\nnever have been able to support the fatigues of those wild days had he\r\nnot carried in his pocket a flask of B.Q. cognac, and had he not been\r\nable from time to time to escape from a midday meal to his club, or\r\nbetter still, to some restaurant where he was unknown. He had, further,\r\non returning to Surrey every night, freely restored his energies by\r\nvigorous draughts of port, a wine to which he had grown accustomed and\r\nwhose use he could ill spare.\r\n\r\nIt was, therefore, no small handicap to find continual allusion made\r\nunder Mr. Stephens's roof to his valiant and thorough-going principles,\r\nnor did it help the situation to see round him every member of the\r\nhousehold, including Mrs. Clutterbuck and his secretary, served with\r\nthe most generous vintages, while he was compelled to choose milk\r\n(which he had never yet been able to digest), water, against which he\r\nhad been often warned, or those aerated substitutes which his doctor\r\nhad repeatedly insisted to be, in his particular case, no better than\r\nwindy poisons.\r\n\r\nHis vigour declined; his voice grew worse and worse; he hesitated in\r\nthe midst of his speeches; he contradicted himself more than once. The\r\nfirst serious opposition, upon the Wednesday night, threw him into\r\na fever of anxiety from which he had not recovered the next day. He\r\nappeared unpunctually before an impatient audience and actually forgot\r\nto appear at all at a smaller meeting later in the evening: a piece of\r\nfolly that cost him fifty votes.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the renewed energies of his opponents rendered his position\r\nless and less enviable as the day of the poll approached, although the\r\nOpposition suffered in this election, as in every other, from the very\r\ngrave drawback that it had no fixed name.\r\n\r\nSince 1910 a heterogeneous body, in which the old theoretical\r\nFree-Traders, of whose exalted principle and vivid intellectual power\r\nthe _Spectator_ was the voice, the wide sporting interests whose\r\nprincipal organ was the _Winning Post_, the new Socialist group and the\r\nremnants of Unionist and Orange following had coalesced; and though\r\nno leader of the first rank appeared, an able secretary, Mr. Ephraim,\r\nmanaged to control the old party chest, but upon a name they could\r\nnot agree, and in almost every separate by-election their candidate\r\nappeared under a different label. Their hold upon the electorate\r\ndepended upon a promise of future reforms which it would take many\r\nyears to carry out and in which the populace but half believed,\r\ncoupled with somewhat academic criticism upon the mistakes of the\r\nparty in office. But this last weapon, the most powerful weapon of any\r\nopposition, they could not use with effect against the administration\r\nof a young and popular Prime Minister, of little more than forty years\r\nof age, whose enormous wealth and well-known delicacy of lung alike\r\nendeared him to the reasonable heart of the people.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Opposition lacked an effective party cry: for the editor\r\nof the _Spectator's_ admirable epigram, \"No fleet, no meat,\" had\r\noffended the powerful vegetarian group, and Mr. Tylee's quatrain in the\r\n_Banner of Israel_ was above the heads of the vulgar.\r\n\r\nSuch was the strength and the weakness of either side when upon Friday,\r\nthe day before the poll, the last meetings were held, the last placards\r\nposted, and the affairs of the opposing parties finally put in order.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Clutterbuck's extreme surprise--for the details of our political\r\nlife were still new to him--a bag of sovereigns was distributed among\r\nthe stout hearts who had worked so hard in the Cause, and Mr. Stephens,\r\nhumorously calling himself for the occasion \"the Bogey Man\"--a\r\npseudonym received with grateful laughter--saw that the hundred good\r\nfellows who had toiled from door to door should receive refreshment as\r\nwell as honest wage. It was distributed in the garage attached to his\r\nmagnificent villa, and the day wound up finding all, with the exception\r\nof the candidate himself, well satisfied.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt that Mr. Clutterbuck was pitiably overwrought. Had\r\nhe dared he would have broken through the convention of so many arduous\r\ndays and have drunk freely from some revivifying spring. But his\r\nconscience and his common sense alike forbade him.\r\n\r\nHe looked forward in despair to the night as his only chance of solace\r\nand relief, and prayed for such repose as might fit him to meet the\r\nterrible strain of the morrow; but that night Mr. Clutterbuck, for all\r\nhis exhaustion, slept ill.\r\n\r\nHe rose frequently in the small hours to swallow one of the Hornsby\r\nlozenges or, when these palled upon him, one of the Glarges. At times\r\nhe gargled, and at others, filling his chest to the fullest extent and\r\nretaining his breath to the utmost of his capacity, he murmured the\r\nsyllables which he had been assured would strengthen the vocal chords.\r\nHe could not, in a stranger's house and at such an hour, permit himself\r\nthe loud roar which the Voice Producer had insisted upon: it would\r\nhave been discourteous and, what was worse, it might have impaired\r\nhis now assured reputation for consistency and sober judgment. It was\r\ndoubtless, however, owing to this unfortunate but necessary omission\r\nthat he owed, next day, his complete inability to speak above a whisper.\r\n\r\nHe rose tired out at seven, dressed wearily, and came down upon that\r\nfatal day, November 19, 1911. He saw with increased depression that\r\nit was raining. He was, I am sorry to say, so distressed during the\r\nheartfelt and simple family prayers of the household as to overset\r\nthe chair at which he knelt; and at breakfast his nervousness was so\r\nintense as to be positively painful to his kind host and hostess, who\r\npressed upon him with assiduous hospitality, kidneys, eggs, bacon,\r\nhaddock seethed in milk, sausages, cold pheasant, Virginia peach-fed\r\nham, and kedgeree. He was indifferent to all these things.\r\n\r\nDuring the few moments after breakfast which our great English\r\nmerchants devote to glancing at the daily Press, he could not bring\r\nhimself to look at the papers which lay upon the table. He so dreaded\r\nthe insults of the one, he dreaded so much more in another the\r\ncondensed reports of what he might have said, that he found himself\r\nlonging, in a sort of dazed way, for some news sheet in which the\r\nworld might be presented to him empty of his own famous name. As it\r\nwas, I repeat, he dared not open one of them.\r\n\r\nLuckily for him his cheery host did not leave him long in this misery.\r\nHe found him standing listless in the hall, slapped him on the back and\r\nsaid in a loud and hearty voice:\r\n\r\n\"You've got to come with me! The motor's ready and the Missus'll be\r\ncoming down at once.\" Then he whispered as the suggestion required:\r\n\"Brandy? All's Mum!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck refused it, and in a few moments his host had returned\r\nwith a decanter of the inspiring beverage. Mr. Clutterbuck gulped a\r\ngreat mouthful fearfully, choked, and suffered, but he was grateful,\r\nand the more grateful for the rapidity with which Mr. Stephens suddenly\r\nrapt the dangerous friend away.\r\n\r\nThey went out together to the car. Within a quarter of an hour his\r\nhostess and Mrs. Clutterbuck had joined them. There was a little\r\nbyplay as to who should sit in the front seats--a byplay in which\r\nMr. Clutterbuck himself was too dispirited to join--but it was soon\r\ndecided by the ladies themselves that the hero of the occasion should\r\nappear next to the driver, nor did the physical danger to which such a\r\nposition exposed him enter the minds of these loyal friends.\r\n\r\nThey proceeded upon the round of the constituency. The streets were\r\nempty and the rain continued to fall. At the corner of Mafeking Avenue\r\nand Paradise Row, a group of young people upon their way to school\r\ncheered loudly upon seeing the National colours, while with childish\r\nthoughtlessness some of their number threw petty missiles after the\r\nretreating car. As they passed down the smaller streets they were\r\ngratified to see Mr. Clutterbuck's portrait, reposing upon a British\r\nlion of formidable aspect and draped as to the hinder quarters in a\r\nUnion Jack, prominent in the windows even of the public-houses.\r\n\r\nAt the police station Mr. Clutterbuck felt his first movement of\r\nemotion at the sight of a policeman who was coming in mackintoshes out\r\nof the door, and who saluted with promptitude and respect.\r\n\r\nThe first polling booth to which they came contained none but the\r\nofficials, but it was Mr. Clutterbuck's duty to enter, to look cheerful\r\nand to shake them by the hand.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing doing here?\" he wheezed with an uneasy smile.\r\n\r\n\"There've been a few,\" said the chief with an indifference that did not\r\nbetray his own politics. \"They're not coming very fast. The weather's\r\nagainst 'em.\"\r\n\r\nAs he said this, a very short man with a sly, rapid glance and a jerky\r\nmanner, darted in, carefully huddled himself round his voting paper,\r\ndropped it into the ballot box, darted a look of violent animosity at\r\nMr. Clutterbuck, and was out again in a flash.\r\n\r\nHe was followed by a publican who shook hands heartily with the\r\ncandidate, said merrily, \"Well, which way 'm I going to vote, I\r\nwonder?\" and disappeared into the hutch puffing and blowing, came out\r\nagain, shook hands again, renewed his witticism in a somewhat different\r\nform: \"Well, which way did I vote, I wonder?\"--and waddled out.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck could bear no more. He climbed again into the motor-car\r\nafter nodding as genially as he could to the officials at the table,\r\nand was asked by his host where he should go next.\r\n\r\nHe suggested Kipling Crescent.\r\n\r\nThe school in Kipling Crescent, by one of those contrasts which are\r\nsymbolic of our enduring sense of equality, though standing in the\r\nchief residential street of Mickleton, was sure to receive the largest\r\nartisan vote, for it was behind the Crescent that the densest and\r\npoorest population of the borough lay. Here there was more animation. A\r\nsteady if thin stream of workmen came in to record their votes. Few of\r\nthem expressed any strong interest in the presence of their candidate;\r\none or two touched their caps to the man who was to restore to them\r\nthe rights of human beings; others smiled somewhat foolishly as they\r\npassed him: the greater part did not recognise him at all. One man, to\r\nwhom manual labour had never appealed, and whose pathetic, intelligent\r\neyes betrayed a world of suffering and of want, approached him and\r\nmurmured a few words. Mr. Clutterbuck caught them indifferently, but\r\nthey were quite enough. He remembered the fatal half sovereign, and he\r\nleapt for the car.\r\n\r\nSo the morning passed in visiting one booth after another. The rain\r\nceased; there was a trifle more life round certain booths; the coming\r\nand going of vehicles bearing the colours of either candidate was\r\ncontinuous. These, as they passed each other, would sometimes indulge\r\nin playful sarcasm. Now and then an honest fight arose, but no serious\r\ninjuries were received, and it was not until the afternoon that the\r\nstreets began to fill.\r\n\r\nThence onward the scene changed. Many who had come from other parts\r\nof London were now free to satisfy their curiosity; the relaxation\r\nfrom labour and the lengthy discussions which already enlivened the\r\npublic-houses were beginning to bear their fruit. There was a sort of\r\nmurmur throughout the whole area of the borough, a murmur which in\r\nplaces rose to a roar.\r\n\r\nIt had been arranged by the agents of the two parties that the car of\r\nMr. Clutterbuck's host should accidentally meet that of Lord Henfield\r\nin front of the Cap and Bells. There was some little delay, and it\r\nwas at first feared that the light would not be strong enough for the\r\nphotographer who was waiting concealed at an adjoining window. Luckily,\r\nbefore it was too late, and when Mr. Stephens's car had waited less\r\nthan ten minutes, Lord Henfield's appeared at the opposite end of the\r\nstreet, the two candidates recognised each other after the first moment\r\nof surprise, descended and shook hands warmly amid the enthusiastic\r\ncheers of the considerable assemblage; it was apparent to all no petty\r\npersonal quarrel would lessen the majesty of that day's verdict.\r\n\r\nAs darkness came on the polling began to grow noticeably heavier. Oddly\r\nenough the female or lady electors, who had during daylight remained\r\nconcealed, came out with the fall of evening. The middle classes, to\r\nwhich this class of voter chiefly belongs, have an ample leisure to\r\nrecord their opinion, but even those most thickly veiled preferred a\r\nlate hour in which to register their votes which, so far as could be\r\njudged, were cast mainly in the National interest. In deference to the\r\nstrong feeling which the sex entertains upon this matter, the returning\r\nofficer had permitted the presence of pet dogs in the polling booths.\r\nIt was upon these that the Party favours were most conspicuously\r\ndisplayed, and it must be admitted that in the greater number of cases\r\nthey were of the popular magenta hue.\r\n\r\nLady Henfield recorded her vote as a lodger in her husband's house\r\na little before seven, and came out full of frisk and smile, having\r\ndoubtless given her voice in favour of the name she bore.\r\n\r\nMrs. Clutterbuck could claim no such privilege, nor was it the least of\r\nMr. Clutterbuck's many chagrins upon this eventful day to consider the\r\nnatural mortification which his wife must have suffered, and would very\r\nprobably express when occasion served, to see Lady Henfield enjoy that\r\nEnglishwoman's right of which she had herself been deprived.\r\n\r\nDuring the last hour before eight o'clock, there clustered an amazing\r\nthrong at every booth, and the intoxication produced by the state of\r\npublic feeling and the domestic habits of the neighbourhood--which were\r\nnever indulged to a higher degree than upon this occasion--communicated\r\nto the best balanced and the most indifferent a certain degree of\r\nenthusiasm. Mr. Clutterbuck had snatched a hasty sandwich and a glass\r\nof lime juice at the refreshment bar in the Town Hall when the booths\r\nwere declared closed and he was admitted to the counting-room.\r\n\r\nThere were few present. He and Lord Henfield were supported by perhaps\r\nhalf a dozen helpers and friends. The Mayor and his young nephew sat\r\nin chairs at a table at the end of the long room, to which the bundles\r\nof votes were brought as the sorters counted them. They were laid in\r\ntwo long lines, one for each candidate, upon this table, and the lines\r\nhad all the appearance of two snakes rapidly increasing in length and\r\nrunning a race as to which should be longest when their growth should\r\ncease.\r\n\r\nDuring all the early part of the counting the issue seemed doubtful\r\nenough. Lord Henfield, spruce, anxious, alert, walked up and down the\r\nsorting benches, turned up continually to glance at the increasing pile\r\nof votes, and as continually strolled back with an intimate companion\r\nto interest himself in the business of the sorting, a sight with which\r\nhe was unfamiliar.\r\n\r\nAs for Mr. Clutterbuck, he was numb to every sensation. The day had\r\nbeen too much for him, and he had become quite careless as to whether\r\nhe lived or died. He stood, well groomed but with leaden eyes,\r\nmoving very little from his place near the mayor's table, when he\r\nchanced to gaze at the two lines of paper bundles and saw that his\r\nown was leading. It did not appear to his unpractised eye to be any\r\nconsiderable lead; the one line was now perhaps a yard long, the other\r\npossibly forty inches. But to the trained observation of those who had\r\nseen half a dozen contests in the borough, it was decisive.\r\n\r\nMr. Maple whispered hoarsely:\r\n\r\n\"You're in!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Clutterbuck answered without a voice:\r\n\r\n\"Am I?\"\r\n\r\nThere were but few more bundles to come. The most of them perhaps were\r\nadded to Lord Henfield's column, but they did not redress the balance.\r\n\r\nLord Henfield's companion, looking as pleasant as he could, pulled out\r\na £5 note which that nobleman pocketed with evident satisfaction. The\r\nmayor jotted down figures upon a bit of paper; when he announced the\r\nresult, Mr. Clutterbuck was elected by the overwhelming majority of\r\n1028 on the heaviest poll the constituency had known. Something like\r\n92 per cent. had voted upon a register not precisely new, and over\r\n19,000--to be accurate, 19,123--votes had been recorded.\r\n\r\nThe mayor congratulated Mr. Clutterbuck upon the sweeping success,\r\nhe shook hands with him and repeated the figures. He congratulated\r\nLord Henfield upon the plucky fight he had made; he congratulated the\r\nsorters upon their accuracy, the counters upon their zeal, and the\r\nborough upon its self-control at a time when feeling had run high. He\r\ncongratulated the police upon their conduct throughout a very difficult\r\nand trying day; and he was in the act of congratulating the borough\r\ncouncil in the same connection, when a wild roar outside the building\r\nshowed that the result had been betrayed or guessed.\r\n\r\nThey adjourned hurriedly to the great hall over the portico. The\r\nwindow was open, and so far as the glare from within the room would\r\npermit them, they perceived an enormous mob, filling the whole square\r\nand stretching far into the streets which converged upon it. The\r\ndeafening noises which had startled them in the inner recesses of the\r\ncounting room were as nothing to the hurricane of shouts, cheers, and\r\ngood-natured blasphemy which swirled about them when they appeared at\r\nthe balcony. In vain did the mayor, with a pleasant smile upon his\r\nface which the darkness alone concealed, raise his hands a dozen times\r\nto impose silence. The swaying of the crowd, the cries of those who\r\nsuffered pressure against the walls upon its exterior parts, nay, the\r\noccasional crash of broken glass, seemed only to add to the frenzy.\r\n\r\nAn individual who, I am glad to say, turned out to be a youth of\r\nirresponsible demeanour, caused a moment's panic by firing a pistol.\r\nThe mayor, with admirable promptitude, took the opportunity of the\r\nsilence that followed to read out the figures. They were not heeded,\r\nbut the renewed bellowing which followed their announcement was more\r\neloquent than any mere statement of the majority could have been. The\r\npopulace were wild with joy at their victory, and that portion of them\r\nwho as bitterly mourned defeat would have been roughly handled had they\r\nnot numbered quite half this vast assembly of human beings.\r\n\r\nWhen some measure of silence had been achieved, Mr. Clutterbuck and\r\nLord Henfield shook hands for the second time that day in a public\r\nmanner, to the supreme delight of both friend and foe.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck recited in an inaudible croak the few courteous and\r\nmanly words which he had prepared for the occasion, and Lord Henfield,\r\na little before Mr. Clutterbuck had completed his last sentence,\r\ndelivered, in much louder but equally inaudible tones, his apology for\r\ndefeat, and his prophecy that he would be more successful upon the next\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore Mr. Clutterbuck could be allowed to go back to the hospitable\r\nroof at Bongers End, he was required to visit his Committee Rooms and\r\nto address the workers. His mind was still a blank, but he bowed to\r\nthem civilly enough and emitted some few hoarse whispers thanking\r\nthem for their unfailing courage, tact, loyalty, gentlemanly feeling,\r\ntireless industry, exhaustive labours and British pluck. For a moment,\r\nand only for a moment, the memory of the bag of sovereigns swept over\r\nhis mind. He was too tired to heed even that memory, and he almost fell\r\ninto his chair when he had concluded.\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed that the workers were a trifle disappointed; their\r\nhonest faces, upon many of which the growth of a three-days' beard\r\ndenoted their unremitting attention to the duties before them, looked\r\nanxiously above their thick neckcloths as though they had expected\r\nsomething more from the man upon whom the eyes of all England were\r\nturned, and whose conspicuous position they had largely helped him\r\nto attain. The situation was solved by Mr. Maple, who, in a voice\r\nworthy of that occasion or of any other, addressed the workers as his\r\nfellows and his equals--for had he not himself begun life as a working\r\nman?--and reiterated with manly enthusiasm, not only the legitimate\r\npraise accorded them by the exhausted Mr. Clutterbuck, but his own\r\nfrequently expressed admiration of their self-denial, zeal, sincerity,\r\nconviction, spontaneous, unflagging hope and indomitable courage.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" he concluded, and gentlemen was surely the term for these\r\nloyal-hearted men, \"we thank you from the bottom of our hearts, not\r\nbecause you have returned Mr. Clutterbuck--don't think that! What is a\r\nman in such mighty moments as these? No, but because you have saved the\r\ngreat principle that....\"\r\n\r\nThe remaining three words of his peroration were lost in a frenzy of\r\napplause. The platform rose and bowed, and as refreshments could not be\r\ngiven (under the \"Corrupt Practices Act\") within the precincts of the\r\nbuilding, the proceedings terminated with a hearty handshake all round\r\nand the immediate dispersion of the audience to another place.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached home, Mr. Clutterbuck's kind host, though himself\r\nan abstainer, opened a bottle of champagne, not indeed for Mr.\r\nClutterbuck, whose principles he well knew, but for Mrs. Clutterbuck,\r\nhis wife, to whom was given the toast of honour, for Mr. Maple, for\r\nMr. Maple's nephew and his two sons, and a Mr. and Mrs. Charles, who\r\nbetween them did honour to the bottle, and very soon despatched it;\r\nthen, in the midst of hearty thanks and renewed congratulations, each\r\nparty left for its home.\r\n\r\nAnd that night at last, after so many nights, Mr. Clutterbuck was\r\npermitted to sleep, and slept.\r\n\r\nHe was a Member of Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mickleton election was a blow that sounded through England. The\r\nhardy mountaineers of Wales, to whom our discussions, save where they\r\nregard religion, so rarely appeal, knew that the manhood of the slate\r\nquarries was free; sailors, newly landed from distant climes, though\r\nsingularly apathetic as a class to the glories of our party system,\r\nfound themselves expected to lift one of their many glasses to the\r\nMickleton election; and in the bowels of the earth the brawny miners of\r\nDurham alluded to Mr. Clutterbuck and his success in the simplest and\r\nmost poignant of terms.\r\n\r\nThe thoughtful who direct the development of English Socialism had\r\nseen, long before, the capital nature of the crisis, and naturally\r\ndeplored an expression of public opinion which by forbidding forced\r\nlabour set so powerful an obstacle in the path of the ideal state; the\r\nstrict party organs of the Opposition were also bound to deplore the\r\nresult, but every sheet of independent position was agreed as to the\r\nsignificance of the election and few judges indeed since Jeffries\r\nhave incurred the epithets, whether grave or severe, which had so\r\nlong been withheld, and now, on the morrow of the election, fell from\r\nall sides upon the honest but narrow and pointed head of Mr. Justice\r\nHunnybubble--for Welch (concurring) was by now quite ignored, and the\r\nstronger man was the target of renown.\r\n\r\nThe wide field of suburban, colonial, American and Indian thought\r\ncommanded by the _Spectator_ might indeed have murmured at the new\r\nprivilege which the working classes threatened to acquire, had not\r\nthat review with singular manliness and courage stood out at the\r\ncritical moment with a strong declaration in favour of the spirit which\r\nMickleton had shown.\r\n\r\n\"England,\" the editor did not hesitate to pen, \"is not tied to a\r\nformula or a syllogism, but to freedom slowly broadening down from\r\nprecedent to precedent,\"[5] and he went so far as to contemplate with\r\nunflinching courage--nay, to command--the release of Fishmonger and\r\nAnother, for whom the principal Halls had already begun an active\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\nThe very different world which is so largely influenced by the _Winning\r\nPost_ was equally sound, and the weekly character, \"In a Glass House,\"\r\nof that powerful instrument of national opinion was Mr. Clutterbuck\r\nhimself, characterised as a sportsman, excused for his personal\r\nsobriety, portrayed in a top hat, frock coat, trousers, spats, buttoned\r\nboots, and perhaps thirty years less than his actual age.\r\n\r\nThe _Sporting Times_ had two good jokes heartily sympathetic with the\r\njudgment of Mickleton. _Punch_ published upon the great verdict a\r\nset of beautiful verses which will long be remembered in our English\r\nparsonages; and the _Daily Mail_ headed their leader \"The Burial of\r\nHarmanism.\"\r\n\r\nEngland was awake; the great principle of unilateral compulsion\r\nhad taken firm root, and never more would the detestable miasma of\r\nContinental pedantry threaten the free life of our land.\r\n\r\nFor the Government the position was not easy, though it was evidently\r\none to be faced. No Administration can afford to treat the Bench\r\nlightly. Buffle might be in trouble any day. They had, moreover, at\r\nleast three great measures in hand, commanding no considerable popular\r\nsupport; one which the electorate had not heard of and another quite\r\nodious to it. This sudden and spontaneous demonstration by a London\r\nborough against a judicial decision which had nothing to do with party\r\nor policy was a factor of grave disturbance in that routine of the\r\nHouse of Commons which is as regular in its way as the breathing of a\r\nprofound sleep. The Cabinet was dispersed in Monte Carlo, Devonshire,\r\nPalermo and New York, a decision could not be come to upon so grave a\r\nmatter for many days to come, and yet an early opening of the session\r\nin January was plainly imperative. The intensity of feeling against\r\nthe judgment which Mr. Clutterbuck's election had condemned, grew with\r\nevery day, and the young head of the National party, who suffered\r\nsomewhat from the right lung and filled the Premiership so brilliantly\r\nand so well, had indeed a heavy problem to resolve.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first act of Mr. Clutterbuck when he returned, the morning after\r\nhis triumph, to his beautiful Surrey home, was to sign a cheque for yet\r\nanother thousand pounds, and to enclose it with a letter of heartfelt\r\nemotion to the funds of the Party. He expressed in this letter his\r\nindifference to the particular object for which, in the Party's\r\njudgment, it might be used, and assured Mr. Delacourt that it was but\r\na slight acknowledgement on his part of what was the duty of every man\r\nin support of those principles which have made England great. Charlie\r\nFitzgerald thoroughly approved of his action, and was free to point out\r\nthat its spontaneous character would render it of double effect. To\r\nthis action there succeeded an interval of repose.\r\n\r\nFor several weeks a round of social recreation dispelled the strain\r\nto which Mr. Clutterbuck had been subjected during the course of his\r\ncampaign; his house was filled with a perpetually changing attendance\r\nof friends to enjoy a few days of his company, and to congratulate him\r\nupon the honour of which he had proved worthy. Nor did many of them\r\nforget to hint--some of them deliberately declared--that it was but the\r\ngate to further and greater honours: though it must be admitted that\r\nthe now ageing politician neither desired nor expected promotion to\r\nCabinet rank.\r\n\r\nAs the procession of City men, Croydon acquaintances and earlier\r\nfriends who had now rallied to Mr. Clutterbuck in his declining\r\nyears filled \"the Plâs,\" Charlie Fitzgerald very honourably took the\r\nholiday he had heartily earned. He went down, at Mary Smith's pressing\r\ninvitation, to her quiet but historic Habberton upon the borders of\r\nExmoor, found there the society of his boyhood, and was the life of\r\nthat little party, with his amusing imitations of social customs in\r\nthe suburbs, his frank pleasure in the champagne which he had chosen\r\nfor his cousin, his madcap bouts upon the little Devon ponies which\r\nwere incapable of throwing so large a rider, and his jests which never\r\nexceeded the limits imposed by the presence of women, several of whom\r\nwere devout adherents of the Christian faith.\r\n\r\nWith all this a certain new glory surrounded Charlie, a glory reflected\r\nfrom the result of the Mickleton election. The people among whom he was\r\nfor the moment a companion at quiet but historic Habberton were not of\r\na kind to exaggerate the influence of a by-election upon the general\r\nscheme of English government; but they did appreciate that here was one\r\nof themselves who could weigh the temper of a great constituency and\r\ncould understand very different classes of men; for Charlie was not\r\nslow to let them understand the part he had played in the business.\r\n\r\nDuring any mention of that campaign his cousin Nobby looked so\r\nthoroughly miserable that it went to Charlie's soft Irish heart.\r\n\r\nNobby had had plenty of money once. He had stood for Parliament when he\r\nwas barely of age, more as a freak and to please his mother than with\r\nserious intentions of political life; but a defeat by over 3000 votes\r\ncoupled with the gradual dissipation of his fortune had rendered him\r\nmore sensitive than was perhaps healthy. A place had been found for him\r\nin the Heralds' College, but the salary was miserably small, and apart\r\nfrom the prestige of such a position, he would almost have been willing\r\nto throw up the perpetual application it demanded and to go and live\r\nquietly hunting and shooting at his mother's place in Derbyshire: for\r\nthough the widow had herself but a small dower, she could afford to\r\nreceive her spendthrift son.\r\n\r\nIt was a good thing that he had not yet completed that intention; for\r\nCharlie, as he watched him in those days at Habberton, found a piece\r\nof work for him which might well lead to greater things. He took his\r\ncousin out one morning to see the stags fed in the new Bethlehem,\r\nwarned Mary Smith that they wanted to be alone, and as they crossed the\r\npark he proposed to Nobby a visit to The Plâs.\r\n\r\nNobby could see nothing in it at all; nay, he met the proposition\r\nwith horror, until it dawned upon him that perhaps some definite and\r\ntangible action was in the wind, and he asked in the most natural\r\nmanner whether he could look forward to any of the Ready?\r\n\r\nCharlie was impatient.\r\n\r\n\"My good Nobby,\" he said, \"don't you know how things are done in this\r\nworld? They're bound to give him a handle!\"\r\n\r\n\"That,\" said Nobby in a refined manner, \"makes my dream come true, but\r\nreally, if you think it affects me----\"\r\n\r\n\"Good God!\" said Charlie, \"don't you see where you come in?\"\r\n\r\n\"I could go and pump him,\" said Nobby wearily, \"but, oh lord, Charlie,\r\nif you only knew! I must have pumped fifty of 'em this year. The worst\r\nare the Johnnies that want Supporters. We'll give them Mullets and even\r\na Fesse Argent or two, but we're very rigid about Supporters,\" he said\r\nsolemnly. \"You don't get Supporters over the counter, I can tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nobby,\" said Charlie, waving all this trash aside, \"to put it plainly,\r\nyou got to go and tell the old boy how it's done ... I mean ... you\r\ngot to let him know how it's done. Don't make a fool of yourself,\" he\r\nadded, looking doubtfully at his young cousin, and wondering whether\r\nthis piece of generosity were wise or not, \"I'm not going to be\r\nbutchered to make a Roman holiday.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll go, Charlie,\" said Nobby humbly, \"I understand. But can't anyone\r\nsee to something of the Ready? After all, I've got to get there, and I\r\nshall have to give something to the servants.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll ask Mary,\" said Charlie nobly.\r\n\r\n\"No you don't,\" shouted Nobby, \"she turned me down this morning.\r\nDamnably!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but this is work,\" said Charlie reproachfully.\r\n\r\nNobby looked grim. \"It's spondulicks, anyway,\" he said. And Charlie\r\nvery reluctantly pulled out four pounds and a few shillings.\r\n\r\nNobby pocketed it without much gratitude.\r\n\r\n\"You know, Nobby,\" said Charlie, watching his expression, \"if you pull\r\nit off sensibly, he won't forget you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I know all about that,\" said Nobby wearily. \"They're awfully\r\ngrateful, but one never gets one's fingers on the flimsies. I'll make a\r\nlast shot, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\nCharlie Fitzgerald did not stand on ceremony; he knew the kind\r\nhearts of the Clutterbucks too well; he wrote a longish letter to\r\nMrs. Clutterbuck about his cousin Robert in the Heralds' College,\r\nintroduced a word or two about his late father and grandfather, the\r\nLord Storrington of the famine, said the lad would be stopping in their\r\nneighbourhood and would really like to come over, enclosed a stamped\r\nenvelope, \"The Hon. Robert Parham, Habberton Park, Barnstaple,\" and\r\nwithin forty-eight hours Nobby, carefully primed as to where he had\r\nbeen stopping in the neighbourhood of Croydon, and whom exactly he\r\nwould see and meet, was off to pass a week-end at The Plâs.\r\n\r\nHis ironical temper and obvious poverty seemed at first ill-suited to\r\nthe merchant's table, but Mrs. Clutterbuck herself forgave him when she\r\ndiscovered, as she immediately did, the warm heart which lay beneath\r\nthese external disabilities: by the Sunday night his conversation was\r\nalready absorbing; she begged him to return, and he did.\r\n\r\nThe second visit was far prolonged. They could not bear to let the\r\nmerry boy go, and his frank anecdotes upon the leading men of the\r\nday, intimate acquaintance with most of whom he could proudly claim,\r\nafforded them not only amusement, but the deeper pleasure of a profound\r\ninterest, and it was in connection with these that he took such\r\nfrequent occasion to deride the too facile conference of titles which,\r\nas he perpetually affirmed, was the jest of the world in which he moved.\r\n\r\nHe quoted more than one case in which without any subscription to\r\nobjects of public utility, wealthy men, merely because they were\r\nwealthy, had been granted a baronetcy; he joked about his work in the\r\nHeralds' College, contrasting such gewgaws as parvenus descend to buy,\r\nwith the honest old yeoman crest upon the silver of his host, and was\r\nespecially severe upon the establishment of fixed prices for public\r\nhonours; a practice which he declared almost worse than the granting of\r\ntitles to the unworthy.\r\n\r\nOf the guests who listened to him with the respect due to an expert,\r\nfew ventured to contradict or even to criticise, but it must be\r\nadmitted that Sir Julius Mosher, who had been knighted years ago on the\r\noccasion of Cornelius Hertz's reception at the Guildhall, was inclined\r\none evening at Mr. Clutterbuck's table to be a trifle interrogatory.\r\n\r\n\"I never gave a penny,\" he said, \"and I think I may say that for most\r\nmen in the City,\" he added, looking round the table and meeting with a\r\nmurmur of approval.\r\n\r\n\"I would never dream of saying such a thing,\" said Nobby warmly. He\r\nblushed a little, but looked at the same time so kindly and so sincere\r\nthat his embarrassment did but enhance the good opinion all had formed\r\nof the young man.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God there are still some honours left that _are_ honours! Now,\r\nI suppose nearly all the new peers ... take the new peers ... nobody\r\nminds; and then most baronets ... since _this_ Government came in....\r\nStill they _did_ pay. And I do say what I most hate in the whole affair\r\nis regular prices fixed. It isn't cricket.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, after all,\" said a Mr. Hutchinson, a doctor of considerable\r\nmeans, and of a solid, quiet judgment. \"What do you mean by 'fixed'?\"\r\nHe put up his hand to dissuade interruption, and to Nobby's horror\r\nopened in the intonation of a set speech: \"Remember the importance\r\nof what you are saying. Chrm! You are in the Heralds' College, and\r\nyou hear a great many things. Chrm! No one denies for a moment that\r\nlarge subscriptions to some public object are often rewarded by some\r\npublic honour.... I may be a little easy-going, but I really don't see\r\nany harm in it. Everybody knows it is--er--done; the recipients are\r\nworthy men and they are just the kind of men who have always been made\r\nknights and baronets, and even peers when they were important enough.\"\r\n\r\nThe brief discourse was well and clearly delivered; it earned the\r\ngratitude of all those older men around the table in whom the art of\r\nliving had bred common sense and to whom short speeches at dinner were\r\nfamiliar; to do justice to Nobby, he was the first to let his sense of\r\njustice return.\r\n\r\n\"You mustn't take me too seriously,\" he said in his decent smiling way.\r\n\"One talks in shorthand. I don't mean a real tariff, nobody could mean\r\nthat, but I think that in the past, 'specially about ten years ago,\r\nturn of the century and with all the fuss of the war on, they _did_\r\nhand things about.... Oh, there were orders as well, you know.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Clutterbuck smiled at him from the head of the table. \"No one\r\nblames you, I'm sure,\" she said. \"But Mr. Parham there was not too\r\nmuch recognition of the people who stood by their country then.\" She\r\nlooked meaningly at her husband. \"I'm sure if you made a list of those\r\npro-Boers who've been....\"\r\n\r\n\"Half time, Mrs. Clutterbuck, half time,\" said Sir Julius Mosher\r\nkindly. He had been among the most prominent opponents of our Colonial\r\npolicy at that moment, and he felt bound to protest against the word\r\nPro-Boer, but his protest was singularly sweet and winning and did not\r\nfor a moment disturb the harmony of the evening.\r\n\r\nThe ladies retired, not to the Persian room which was rarely inhabited\r\nin winter, but to the snuggery. Nobby held the door for them as they\r\nwent out, and added to his laurels by the perfect apology he made for\r\ntearing Lady Mosher's train.\r\n\r\nThe conversation between the men drifted on to other subjects,\r\nfoxhunting, lithia water, the Territorial army, and all the rest upon\r\nwhich men of this stamp are particularly engaged; while Dr. Hutchinson,\r\nwho feared he might have offended the enthusiastic young fellow, took\r\na chair by his side, and upon Nobby's mentioning the name of his\r\ngrandfather, Lord Storrington, furnished the most interesting and\r\nvoluminous details upon that nobleman's last illness, operation, and\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nMuch later, when all the rest had said good-night, Nobby, who loved a\r\nfarewell glass, followed his host to the old smoking-room, preserving\r\nhis balance in the dark corridor by a hand upon either wall. They sat\r\ntogether exchanging the common-places that will pass between newly\r\nfound friends when they are at last alone, until Mr. Clutterbuck,\r\nwho had spent a few moments with his wife arranging matters for the\r\nfollowing day, turned to a subject he could not wholly ignore, and said\r\nwith perfect tact:\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, but now that we're alone, tell me, how much really\r\nis there in what you were saying? I know there's more in it than\r\nthose gentlemen say, and you think there's more in it, don't you?\"\r\nFor Mr. Clutterbuck, like many men newly introduced to the necessary\r\ncompromises and halftones of our manifold political life, was still\r\nready to receive secrets that seemed to him dramatic and to criticise\r\nfrom close at hand methods which during the most of his life he had\r\nonly known as vague rumours.\r\n\r\nNobby very thoughtfully chose from the silver box beside him a gigantic\r\ncigar, and said, holding the matchbox in his hand ready to strike:\r\n\r\n\"Tell you the truth, there's precious little,\" and having said that he\r\nlaughed with the laugh of a boy, and suddenly subsided into his chair.\r\n\r\n\"Well, but,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck, without insistence, \"there must be\r\nthis much in it, that a man who sacrifices more than a certain amount\r\nand is known to be a hearty supporter of the tariff, for instance, or\r\nof the evacuation of Egypt, or ... or let's say what the Government did\r\nlast June in Burmah would be noticed, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes,\" said Nobby, speaking as of a common-place. \"But that's true\r\nof course of anything. If a man's known to 've done something _really_\r\nhandsome, silly not to recognise him. 'Sides which, it's _done_,\r\nalways done. What I was complainin' of was the people who really\r\nhaven't got any claim at all. F'r instance,\" he said, lowering his\r\nvoice and looking over his shoulder for a moment, \"Johnnie Higgins....\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir John Higgins?\" said Mr. Clutterbuck, startled at the name of that\r\nprominent country gentleman.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" went on Nobby simply, \"Johnnie _Higgins_ wouldn't 've had\r\nanything in the course of nature. Of course he _wanted_ it, and he\r\nhasn't got a son, an' one way an' another.... But still, there _was_\r\nthe regulation price of five thousand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, five thousand,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck, his head bent well\r\nbackwards, his eyes regarding the ceiling, and his tone expressing the\r\nenormity of the sum----\r\n\r\n\"No, but,\" continued Nobby, up on his feet again,--\"I _do_ object, and\r\nso would you if you were where I am; five thousand means different\r\nthings to different men; now just because a man is in parliament and\r\nweighs in with five thousand....\"\r\n\r\nHere he was silent. He had some regard for truth and he felt that his\r\ntemperament was running away with him. How many men he could call\r\nto mind who had given first and last twenty, thirty, forty thousand\r\npounds to some great cause and had remained the plain commoners they\r\nwere born. It would have been well for him and for his host if he\r\nhad spoken aloud as the confession passed through his thought, but\r\nNobby was as weak as he was good-natured and that thought remained\r\nunexpressed.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck continued his theme. Financial success had bred in him\r\na dependence upon fact and figure. Five thousand pounds was a very\r\nlarge sum, but it was tangible; it was precise; one could write it down.\r\n\r\n\"I know men,\" he said slowly, \"to whom that would be a capital: believe\r\nme, a considerable capital. Why, there's Doctor Hutchinson,\" he said,\r\nlowering his voice, and bending forward, \"if you will believe me\"\r\n(in still lower tones) \"that man hasn't got five thousand now. He's\r\nnot worth it.\" He pressed his lips together as men do after a final\r\nstatement, and said by way of conclusion: \"They're all like that, that\r\ncall themselves 'professional men.' Here to-day and gone to-morrow,\r\nexcept they take out a patent or something, or really go in for\r\nbusiness, and precious few can do that.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're quite right,\" said Nobby, who was bored and who had been\r\nthinking anxiously about the hour of next morning's breakfast. \"I never\r\nhad any myself,\" he added genially, and Mr. Clutterbuck smiled at the\r\njest of the grandson of the Earl of the Creation of the year of the\r\nAct of the Union of England and of Ireland.\r\n\r\nNobby yawned and sloshed soda water into his glass. \"Well, it's a lot\r\nof rot, isn't it?\" he said, and clinched the conversation down.\r\n\r\nThey went up to bed that night, Mr. Clutterbuck, after apologising, as\r\nhusbands will, for the lateness of the hour, turned many of his remarks\r\nto his wife upon this corrupt practice, weighing its probabilities\r\nand its exaggerations, until that lady first passed judgment and then\r\nimposed silence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCharlie Fitzgerald should have been home upon the Wednesday next. A\r\nchance whim had taken him to Monte Carlo, from whence he telegraphed\r\nthat he could hardly be back before Saturday. In the interval Mr.\r\nClutterbuck, sauntering into town upon one of those clear December\r\ndays which often prolong autumn into the heart of winter, happened to\r\ncall at Delacourt's house, but he was at the office at Peter Street.\r\nMr. Clutterbuck immediately sought him in that place and was received\r\nwith something more cordial than courtesy, and many a merry laugh was\r\nexchanged between himself and the young organiser before the chief\r\nbusiness of his visit was mentioned.\r\n\r\nEven when the time came for that, Mr. Clutterbuck showed unaccountable\r\nnervousness, but he had taken full counsel; he knew his wife's\r\nopinion; his own mind was made up; he had not even waited for Charlie\r\nFitzgerald. When, therefore, he had said good-bye and was just stepping\r\nout of the door he suddenly, as though by an afterthought, pulled an\r\nenvelope from his pocket and said sunnily:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Mr. Delacourt, I'd almost forgotten this. I could have posted\r\nit--but it's just as well to give it you now I have it. Read it at your\r\nleisure. Read it absolutely at your leisure.\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded twice and was gone.\r\n\r\nMr. Delacourt opened the envelope, fully expecting some little protest\r\nor other. To his wild astonishment there came out a note of not more\r\nthan four lines, and a cheque for £3000.\r\n\r\nBozzy Delacourt had seen a good deal of life; he had pawned many\r\narticles before his father's death, and had mortgaged not a little land\r\nbetween that event and his marriage. He had seen many cheques signed by\r\nmany men for many purposes; but the like of this he had never seen.\r\n\r\n\"What the devil!\" he said, looking at the cheque as one would at a\r\nstrange and unexpected beast. \"What the devil----\" He went over to\r\nthe window, leant against it and murmured to himself: \"If he's mad\r\nsomething ought to be done. He might make a scene in the House. By\r\nGod!\" he added to himself with a sudden change of expression, \"it\r\nwould be Maraschino and Ice to see him passing the stuff on to one\r\nof those journalists during a division, or endowing the p'licemen, or\r\nsomething.... Wish I'd known men like that in '92! I'd have pulled old\r\nSam Lewis's leg.\" The thought set his eyes adream and afire. \"I'd have\r\nplayed him,\" he added with sudden vicious earnestness, \"I'd have played\r\nhim like a bloody fish!\"\r\n\r\nAnd having thus relieved his mind, he prepared the cheque for passing\r\nit in, then thought he'd better show it to his chiefs, locked it into a\r\nparticular drawer, and went out.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Tennyson.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sacred season of Christmas was approaching and Charlie Fitzgerald\r\nhad returned.\r\n\r\nHe had not been lucky at Monte Carlo. I do not only mean in the\r\nfavourite amusement of that place, which he had indulged in for no\r\nmore than the first day of his visit, for his means were restricted,\r\nbut also in the weather and the company he found. For the anniversary\r\nof the Birth of Christ had drawn from the Riviera to their respective\r\nhomes many in that cultured cosmopolitan world which held the most\r\nintimate of his friends.\r\n\r\nHe returned, therefore, to The Plâs not in ill humour--that he could\r\nnever show--but a little sobered and now and then a little sad. When\r\nMr. Clutterbuck exposed to him in full the action he had seen fit to\r\ntake, no one could have been more sympathetic than he.\r\n\r\n\"It was a large thing to do, Clutterbuck,\" he said as they strolled\r\nround the garden arm in arm, \"but I think it was a wise one.\"\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was mild, it had not rained for several hours, and the\r\npaths were dry. Charlie Fitzgerald, thinking of what to say next, threw\r\na pebble or two into the lake, and then went on:\r\n\r\n\"Abroad, of course, they don't understand this Fishmonger business;\r\nbut they do understand that there's a change in English politics ...\r\nwe've come to a sort of turning-point,\" he said thoughtfully, somewhat\r\nin the same tone as men talked of the Labour Party years before. \"The\r\nold party divisions have changed; I don't know whether you like it or\r\nwhether you don't; I've never made up my mind; but you're on the crest\r\nof the wave of the change, and you can't help it.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck surveyed the breadth of the English dale, the woods\r\nof Surrey and his own great house; he felt the responsibility and the\r\nburden of the high function which England had thrust upon him.\r\n\r\n\"I shall try to do my duty,\" he said humbly.\r\n\r\nAnd the two types--the Anglo-Saxon and the Celt--were constrained to a\r\ncommon silence for some moments. Then Mr. Clutterbuck said again: \"I\r\nshall try to do my duty.\"\r\n\r\nCharlie Fitzgerald was really moved. \"You couldn't have done better,\"\r\nhe said. \"In politics it is absolutely necessary to be hall-marked in\r\nsome way; and men like you, who can't stoop to eccentricity, are much\r\nbetter when they are hall-marked by a simple honour. _I_ know, and I\r\ndare say you know, that they'd have given it to you long ago, but you\r\nnever wanted it, you never asked for it--and I don't mind telling you\r\nthey think the better of you.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck was deeply touched; men of his sort do not always\r\nunderstand how much they gain or lose by their simplicity, and it is\r\npleasant to know that such a quality in one's soul has made one beloved.\r\n\r\n\"They'd have given it you on the King's birthday last year,\" said\r\nFitzgerald with quiet emphasis, \"and they'd have given it just before I\r\ncame here: Bozzy talked of it openly. Since I've been here they haven't\r\nsaid anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"They haven't had occasion to, Mr. Fitzgerald,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered Fitzgerald, \"and it doesn't do to rush things. Besides\r\nwhich, the obvious thing is the New Year.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck, \"that one knows more or less--I\r\nmean--there's some sort of warning given one, because after all there's\r\na kind of ceremony--in some cases, I mean,\" he added hurriedly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes,\" said Fitzgerald airily. \"They let you know all right: five or\r\nsix days beforehand; but it's quite informal. I remember my sister's\r\ngreat friend, that Egyptologist fellow\"--he sought for the name--\"well,\r\nanyhow, the man who wrote that account of Milner in Egypt and signed\r\nit Mayfield--can't remember his name, but I remember his just being\r\ntold--Meyer! that's it--Ernest Meyer!--I remember his being told\r\ncasually through somebody else. Sometimes they don't do it. Teeling\r\ndidn't know about _his_ baronetcy till he landed, and that was ten days\r\nafterwards.\"\r\n\r\nThe conversation frittered away, but Fitzgerald knew what to do.\r\nNext day he forced himself upon Delacourt, dined with him: and took\r\noccasion to ask his cousin how things stood, and he learned, to his no\r\nsmall embarrassment, that headquarters thought his employer had been\r\nprecipitate.\r\n\r\n\"Well, but look here, Bozzy,\" he said, as they went across Westminster\r\nBridge together to the Canterbury to see the Philadelphians. \"It's not\r\nmuch of a business: if a man's got the big election of one's time, and\r\nall the Press behind him, and everybody waiting for the new session,\r\nand _then_ shells out--I don't care how--really! It ought to be like\r\ntaking it off a shelf.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, but it isn't,\" said Bozzy, as they took their tickets.\r\n\r\nAll through the evening at intervals between the turns they pursued\r\nthe matter jerkily, and Charlie Fitzgerald was curious to note\r\nhis cousin's singular obstinacy. Bozzy was quite fixed about it.\r\nHeadquarters were annoyed.\r\n\r\n\"It isn't so simple. To begin with, it'll look like being frightened\r\nof Mickleton; and then Billingshurst and Dangerfield are dead against\r\nthis stinking Fishmonger agitation anyhow. Dangerfield is Hunnybubble's\r\nbrother-in-law, for what that's worth, and altogether it's not the\r\ntime. Number one _certainly_ won't do it _yet_: not a measly V.O. Told\r\nme so himself.\"\r\n\r\nCharlie Fitzgerald had a very simple reply. \"If it isn't in the New\r\nYear list,\" he said, \"he'll make trouble, and I don't blame him.\"\r\n\r\n\"How _can_ he make trouble?\" said Bozzy uneasily.\r\n\r\nAt this point a very large man in uniform interfered, and they were\r\ncompelled to listen to a ventriloquist who imitated with astounding\r\nfidelity the barking of a little dog, enclosed by accident in an\r\nottoman.\r\n\r\nAs they went out and recrossed the bridge, Charlie would not release\r\nhis cousin; he dragged him towards the station and plied him still.\r\n\r\n\"It really _is_ a big thing,\" he pleaded.\r\n\r\n\"Good God!\" said Bozzy, losing his temper at or about that point in\r\nVictoria Street where the proud embassy of Cape Colony lifts its flag\r\nin the heart of the Empire. \"Don't pester me, I'm not the Prime\r\nMinister!\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said Charlie quietly, \"I'll go and see _him_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, do that by all means,\" said Bozzy, enormously relieved, \"but don't\r\nget to Downing Street before three; he refuses everything steadily\r\nfrom after lunch till three o'clock. Then he takes that stuff Helmsley\r\nordered him, and a few minutes afterwards he does everything for\r\neverybody; at least that's the only way I account for the two last\r\nappointments.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a cynical and a stupid thing to say of a man as hardworking\r\nand as capable as the young Prime Minister of England, who had led\r\nthe National Party to success less than two years before; and who,\r\nmoreover, was known to be suffering from an affection of the left lung;\r\nbut there was this much truth in it, that all men have their hours: no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nCharlie Fitzgerald brought home news that evening which lifted Mr.\r\nClutterbuck's heart. He would not commit himself, but he told him very\r\nplainly that he had seen his cousin, that his cousin could not speak\r\nfor the Government (and, after all, that was common-sense!), but that\r\nhe, Charlie, was to see the Prime Minister the next day.\r\n\r\nThe truth looks very different to different men, and all external\r\nverities must, alas, be stated in mere human terms; this plain and\r\njust and honest phrase \"and I'm to see the Prime Minister to-morrow,\"\r\nsank into Mr. Clutterbuck's mind with a very different effect from that\r\nwhich it could produce upon the experienced and travelled intellect of\r\nthe man who spoke it.\r\n\r\nHis secretary was to see the Prime Minister the next day! It seemed\r\nmore to Mr. Clutterbuck than it does to the delicately nurtured youth\r\nof England when they hear in the morning of their lives that they are\r\nto see the elephant at the Zoo. It had a thousand ritual connotations:\r\nit was the power, the kingdom and the glory. He felt it odd to be in\r\nthe same room with his secretary.\r\n\r\nHow could that secretary, who had called the present Prime Minister\r\n\"Uncle Dunk\" since he could first lisp a word, know of what it was that\r\npassed in the new member's heart?\r\n\r\nAt dinner Mr. Clutterbuck very properly forebore to allude to such\r\nmatters in the remotest manner before the very large and varied\r\nassembly of guests. Nor were he and his secretary alone together during\r\nany part of the remainder of the evening.\r\n\r\nNext morning with the reticence that sits so well upon our wealthier\r\nmen, he did no more than accompany Fitzgerald from the luncheon-room\r\nto the motor, help him in, and shake him warmly by the hand as he went\r\noff.\r\n\r\nFitzgerald, wisely remembering his cousin's somewhat petulant advice,\r\nsent no warning before him, but turned up at Downing Street a little\r\nbefore four. His reception was very cordial. They had known each other\r\nfrom the time when Charlie was in petticoats, a baby, in and out of\r\nMary Smith's house in the height of its splendour, and the Prime\r\nMinister a young man, almost a boy himself, fresh from his victory in\r\nthe Isle of Dogs and the idol of that Free Trade Unionist section which\r\nhe had since triumphantly transformed into the National Party after his\r\nacceptance of the Round Table Tariff in 1909.\r\n\r\nCharlie did not waste five minutes in coming to the point, and he\r\nput it with a simplicity that did him honour. He let the head of the\r\nGovernment talk upon the bigness of the Mickleton election and upon the\r\nway in which it had caught the Press, and when it was his turn to speak\r\nhe quietly took it for granted that Mr. Clutterbuck's name would appear\r\namong the New Year's honours.\r\n\r\nBut there was a great deal more in the Prime Minister than met the\r\nnaked eye; he shook his head with a determination of which the ballast\r\nwas his big bulging forehead with its rare wisp of hair, and he said:\r\n\r\n\"All that's been thought about, Charlie.\"\r\n\r\nFitzgerald got quite red. He saw danger and was annoyed.\r\n\r\n\"You _are_ making a fuss,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"No, I'm not,\" said the Prime Minister kindly.\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean to say you're not going to do it?\" said Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\n\"Of course we are, but not before the House meets. It would bind us. It\r\ncan't be done,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"You mean 't'd look like reversing the judgment by statute?\"\r\n\r\n\"Charlie,\" said the other, somewhat gravely, \"you're too old to ask\r\n'why.'\" He smiled at him a little quizzically.\r\n\r\n\"Then when you mean to do it?\" said Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I really don't know.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister had occasion to go out, and they went out together,\r\nbut Charlie, when he left him a few moments later, was feeling a good\r\nmany things. He was feeling that he had weakened his own position\r\nin one house at least, and that he had done it for nothing; and\r\nhe determined that a lowering of position like that could not be\r\ntolerated. He easily saw the way to repair it. He would begin to put on\r\nthe screw.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Clutterbuck that evening he simply said the Prime Minister had\r\nbeen most delightful and had met him halfway, and had taken the whole\r\nthing for granted, but said of course there must be a little delay.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck, \"of course.\" In this intimacy he\r\ntalked about the matter quite frankly. \"I quite understand; there's a\r\nwhole fortnight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Charlie Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\nIt was the 15th of December.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is not the custom in this country for men whom the Sovereign is\r\npleased to honour to make a vulgar boast of their advancement; but it\r\nis inevitable that an approaching accession of social rank should be\r\nexpected by the immediate circle of the recipient.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible that Mr. Clutterbuck's wife should not know; her\r\nbrother also knew, of course, though perhaps he did wrong to write a\r\nlong letter of congratulation: he had a claim to be told. And the Rev.\r\nIsaac Fowle as the spiritual, Dr. Hutchinson as the medical, adviser\r\nof the merchant, were naturally soon informed. Mr. Clutterbuck and his\r\nwife were far too well-bred to speak of the honour which was advancing\r\nupon them with every day that slipped from the old year; they mentioned\r\nit to none but the nearest of their friends. But a wide outer ring\r\ncould not but hear the news, and a still more extended radius received\r\nit with some little exaggeration. In Oxted, Limpsfield, and Red Hill\r\nit was a peerage; and in the remoter villages where Mr. Clutterbuck's\r\nmotor-cars were familiar, it was a place in the Cabinet as well; but\r\nto all, and to no one more than the Clutterbucks, there was one thing\r\ncertain, that the date was the New Year.\r\n\r\nThe Press alone--and that was a large exception--had kept silent upon\r\nthe rumour.\r\n\r\nFrom one day to another Charlie Fitzgerald laid siege, but Bozzy was\r\nfirst obdurate, then tired, then angry, and the Prime Minister he could\r\nnot see again. Whether Fitzgerald were right or not in what he next\r\ndid it is for posterity to judge; his first duty, he thought, was to\r\nthe man whose bread and salt he ate, and three days before Christmas\r\nhe got the paragraph about Mr. Clutterbuck into half the daily papers\r\nof London; every one was away from Peter Street, and the usual\r\ncontradiction did not follow by return.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas Eve, during the delightful old-world party which Mrs.\r\nClutterbuck gave to the children of the neighbourhood, their parents\r\nvery openly congratulated her husband. Upon Boxing Day the savour of\r\nhis triumph remained in his mouth. It was not until Wednesday the\r\n27th that the official protest came from the office of the patronage\r\nsecretary.\r\n\r\nIt would have been better for every one concerned had that protest been\r\nplain. \"It is better to use the surgeon's knife than to let the cancer\r\ngrow.\"[6] But Mr. Clutterbuck had been most generous. To be too harsh\r\nwould be, perhaps, to close the door upon future action, and all that\r\nappeared was a line or two in very small type, to the effect that the\r\nrepresentative of the paper (and every paper in London had it) had\r\ncalled at the head office in Peter Street with regard to the rumour\r\nrecently published, and\r\n\r\n  \"had official authority to say that the officials were prepared to\r\n  say officially that little more could for the moment at least be said\r\n  upon the matter.\"\r\n\r\nThe lines were few, I say, the print was small and the prose bad, but\r\nsuch as they were they did but confirm the rumour which meant so much\r\nto two simple hearts, and might have meant more to the public as an\r\nindication of the coming policy of the Government in the matter of\r\nFishmonger and Another.\r\n\r\nCharlie Fitzgerald sat tight, and the old year waned.\r\n\r\nA gathering, even larger than those which Mr. Clutterbuck had summoned\r\nduring the sacred season just passed, gladly and happily drank out the\r\nold year. They sang Auld Lang Syne with hands across, and many another\r\ndear old song of friendship and remembrance, and not a few at the close\r\nof the evening departed with a vague conception that religion had\r\npresided at their feast.\r\n\r\nSo ended that year 1911 in a night glorious with keen and flashing\r\nstars. It was a year which had done many great and perilous things for\r\nEngland, but it was one of which every one could say in his heart, with\r\nthe Prophet Ozee,[7] \"It _was_ good!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first of January 1912 was, as many of my readers will know, a\r\nMonday. The happy new week and the happy new year opened together\r\nwith a radiant frost upon the beautiful Vale of Caterham. The ice\r\non the artificial lake supported with ease the Japanese ducks, its\r\ninhabitants, and Mr. Clutterbuck rose from bed, a man advanced in the\r\nCommonwealth and younger by ten years.\r\n\r\nHe was in no haste to read the great news, but he was down before his\r\nsecretary or his wife. He could not forbear to glance casually at the\r\n_Times_, which lay unopened on the breakfast table. He scanned the\r\nhonours list in a casual fashion and made sure that he had missed his\r\nname. He went out and spoke to the stable-boy in a very happy voice,\r\nas of one who can easily arrange and uplift the lives of others; but\r\nthe stable-boy was strangely silent, as he thought, and he was annoyed\r\nto see Astor lunge out a vicious kick. He came back into the house\r\nand picked up the _Times_ again. He was astonished to note that the\r\nlist was alphabetical; at least it was alphabetical for the baronets.\r\nThere were a great number of C's, but there was no Clutterbuck. Sir\r\nPercy--Percy was the name he had chosen--Sir Percy Clutterbuck; it was\r\nnot there!\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck was a business man. He was not one of those who pin\r\nthemselves to the mechanical accuracy of mechanical things. He did not,\r\nas women do, glance at a clock and take its dial to mark the exact\r\nhour; still less did he glance at the quotations of prices in the\r\n_Times_ and believe, as the widows and the orphans do, that one may buy\r\nand sell indifferently, at the precise figures mentioned. He looked\r\nat the knights, but in the knights there was not even a C, unless\r\nI mention Sir Sebastian Cohen, who had acquired the dignity in the\r\nBarbadoes.\r\n\r\nHis mind would have suffered the mortal chill had not Hope remained in\r\nthe box; and Hope, which never quite leaves men, does something more,\r\nfor it often suggests the truth at last. He remembered the orders.\r\nThe Bath he could neglect; but he remembered the Victorian Order, and\r\nothers. It would be a strange way of doing things, but who could\r\ntell? He glanced down a complicated list, and St. Michael was there,\r\nand St. George, and the late Queen also, Victoria.... But there was no\r\nClutterbuck.\r\n\r\nBefore he had finished the list, bending over it almost double on the\r\nlow table, he was unpleasantly aware that his wife and his secretary\r\nwere in the room. He bolted upright, left the paper, and said there was\r\nno news from the Congo.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck very properly prided himself upon a power of\r\nself-control; his wife did not open the paper in his presence. He took\r\nhis secretary after breakfast out into the bright frosty air near the\r\nplantation. He told Fitzgerald all, and then said simply:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Fitzgerald, will you do something for me?\"\r\n\r\nFitzgerald was very willing.\r\n\r\n\"Will you go up to London in the Renault,\" (the Limousine was under\r\nrepair) \"and find out about this?\"\r\n\r\nCharlie Fitzgerald was in the Renault within an hour.\r\n\r\nAt lunch Mrs. Clutterbuck did not like to ask her husband any\r\nquestions, but she wrote to the guests that there was illness in the\r\nhouse; she put them off with a heavy heart, for one never knows when\r\none's expected guests may be one's guests again.\r\n\r\nCharlie Fitzgerald was back before dinner. He said that Bozzy was out\r\nof town, but that a clerk had heard there was a mistake and that it\r\nwould be rectified in a few days.\r\n\r\nTherefore Wednesday passed, but Thursday was very ominous, and again\r\nCharlie Fitzgerald was unconvinced. He knew too much of men to wait\r\nfor any questions. He was on the telephone long before breakfast, and\r\nwhen Mr. Clutterbuck came down he saw his secretary, dressed ready for\r\ndriving into London.\r\n\r\n\"If Bozzy isn't in,\" said he, \"I'll get out into Essex and see Morris.\r\nHe's perfectly certain to know. But,\" he added, \"I may be out all\r\nnight.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck gloomily assented and the lonely house was deprived for\r\nthirty-six hours of the Irish grace and light which radiated from that\r\nyoung soul.\r\n\r\nOn the Friday afternoon, in a storm of rain, Charlie Fitzgerald\r\nreturned. The panting of the car was still heard as he broke into the\r\nsmoking-room dripping wet and took his employer, at once by the arm,\r\ninto the gallery.\r\n\r\n\"It's a mistake in one way,\" he said, \"but Bozzy says it isn't a real\r\nmistake. Your name was down but they didn't sign.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Fitzgerald,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck, almost in tears, \"_I'm_ going\r\nin to London.\" And next day into London he went.\r\n\r\nBozzy was out, but at the central office they greeted him with\r\nenthusiasm, and spoke to him of current affairs, of his great victory\r\nat Mickleton, of the wonderful enthusiasm of the Press, but all he said\r\nupon the honours list and upon the recognition of others was met with\r\nnothing more substantial than rapid affirmatives and very hearty smiles.\r\n\r\nHe went back in bitterness of spirit towards Victoria and on the way he\r\nmet William Bailey sailing down Bird Cage Walk like a great wingless,\r\nlong-legged bird, empty of everything for the moment but an infantile\r\njoy. He was right upon him before William Bailey recognised him, but\r\nwhen that eccentric did so he seized him by both hands and hearing of\r\nhis destination, marched him westward.\r\n\r\n\"We never finished that conversation, did we, Clutterbuck?\" he said.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck vaguely remembered the evening at Mrs. Smith's, or\r\nrather he vaguely remembered the word or two that William Bailey had\r\nspoken.\r\n\r\n\"Peabody Yid, eh?\" said William Bailey in a somewhat vulgar manner,\r\ncatching him in the ribs with his elbow. \"Have you learned anything\r\nmore about the Peabody Yid? You City men are as thick as thieves!\" And\r\nhe laughed in a lower key.\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand you,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck in real perturbation\r\nand suffering. \"I don't understand you. Can't you speak like everybody\r\nelse? I'm tired of the lot!\"\r\n\r\nIt was a genuine little cry of pain and William Bailey, being a\r\nfanatic, was sentimental and was saddened.\r\n\r\n\"What's up?\" he said.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck told him. First briefly, then at length, then with\r\npassion he poured out his great wrong. The money paid, accepted--all\r\nhis friends told--and then the humiliation of New Year's day.\r\n\r\nWilliam Bailey walked him back and forth before the Palace, then he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"We'll get in a cab, I shall have less time to speak in that way,\" and\r\nafter that last paradox he talked sense; but it was very brief sense.\r\n\r\nHe simply told Mr. Clutterbuck in the short two hundred yards which led\r\nthem to the station, that if he really wanted help, the unhappy William\r\nBailey was there, and having said that, when Mr. Clutterbuck had taken\r\nhis ticket and was off to the wicket, he looked for half a second\r\ninto the merchant's eyes with that strange and dangerous power which\r\nthe demagogue has commanded in all ages: to the untutored mind of Mr.\r\nClutterbuck it was a glance of singular fascination. So they parted.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: The Dean of Portsmouth, \"Mixed Sermons,\" vol. iii. p. 465.\r\nHeintz & Sons. 42_s._ London: 1910.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Ozee, xvii. 8.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Bailey was at this time nearer fifty than forty years of age.\r\nThose who saw him for the first time would have imagined him to be an\r\nexceptionally vigorous and well-preserved man of maturer years, for\r\nwhile his eyes were energetic and lively the skin of his face had been\r\nhardened and lined by travel in very different climates. Moreover, his\r\nhair, though not scanty, had turned that peculiar steely grey which men\r\nso often preserve well on into old age.\r\n\r\nHis stature, which was considerable, he owed to a pair of very long\r\nthin legs, which looked the longer from the invariably ill-fitting\r\nloose trousers that he wore; his boots were of enormous size. These,\r\nagain, were exaggerated to the ordinary beholder from his habit of\r\npurchasing pairs far too large for him; and these, I regret to say,\r\nwere ready made, with square toes, very flat heels, and those offensive\r\ndeep creases across the instep which betray the slovenly man.\r\n\r\nHis face, which was long and good-humoured, was framed by two vast\r\nwhiskers which seemed to belong to an earlier age. And in general his\r\nappearance, while certainly denoting ability, might have led one to\r\nexpect a sort of reticent good-nature. The impression was heightened\r\nby his habit of leaning good-humouredly forward with his hands in his\r\npockets, and a genial half-smile, to listen attentively to whatever\r\nwords were addressed to him, especially if those words proceeded from\r\nan unknown man or from one who seemed proud of his acquaintance.\r\n\r\nThere were none that met him casually in the world, but expected from\r\nhim the most kindly judgments and the most reasonable if independent\r\nviews. They were invariably deceived.\r\n\r\nThe man had acquired peculiarities of outlook which in any society less\r\ntolerant than our own would have doomed him to isolation. As it was,\r\nthe most part of his equals treated him as a joke they could afford to\r\nlaugh at; but some few out of the many to whom he had given legitimate\r\noffence found themselves unable to forgive, and these were filled in\r\nhis presence with an ill ease which he, of all men, had the least right\r\nto impose: among these--I bitterly regret--was even to be found that\r\ngracious, kind old man, the Duke of Battersea, who in all his long and\r\nuseful life had hardly spoken harshly of a single foe.\r\n\r\nIn politics none could say whether William Bailey were National or\r\nOpposition; his religion it was impossible to discover; even those\r\nphilosophies which attract in their turn most men of intelligence\r\nappeared to leave him indifferent; he was ignorant of Hegel of\r\nNietzsche and of Oppenheim, but his opinions were none the less\r\nexpressed with a violence and a tenacity which sometimes produced\r\nthe illusion of a general system, though a collection of his real or\r\naffected prejudices would have proved many of them contradictory one\r\nof the other. He would rail, for instance, against the practice of\r\ndrinking champagne with meat, and he would denounce it with the same\r\nfervour as he would use against things so remote from him as the Senate\r\nof Finland or the Republican party in the United States.\r\n\r\nHis dislike, or his assumed dislike, of certain English writers,\r\nnotably the poet Hibbles, on which he might at least be allowed an\r\nopinion or even a prejudice (for he was admittedly a good judge of\r\nverse), was not so strong as his detestation of Tolstoi (not one word\r\nof whose works he could read in the original or had even read in\r\ntranslations!), or his contempt for Harnack, the very A B C of whose\r\nscience he ignored. He denied with equal decision the theory of natural\r\nselection and the hypothesis of a recent glacial epoch, and had more\r\nthan once committed himself to print in points of etymology on which\r\nhe knew nothing, and his excursion into which had only rendered him\r\nridiculous.\r\n\r\nIt would be too easy to explain the man as a mere mass of opposition,\r\nthough it is certain that the greater part of his enthusiasms,\r\nif enthusiasms they were, were aroused by the spectacle of some\r\nuniversally received opinion. It would be truer to say that he was\r\never ready to use his quick and not untrained intelligence in defence\r\nof chance likes and dislikes which, when he had so defended them\r\nfor a sufficient time, took on in his mind a curious and unnatural\r\nhardness that sometimes approached and sometimes passed the line of\r\ncomplete conviction. On some points, indeed, he had been compelled to\r\nretreat. His theory that the English Press was not the property of its\r\nostensible owners but was subsidised by a mysterious gang of foreign\r\nfinanciers, he discreetly dropped on finding it untenable, though for\r\nyears he had startled his new acquaintances and wearied his relatives\r\nby various aspects of that particular piece of nonsense; and his\r\nrepeated assertion that Japanese torpedo boats had really been present\r\non the Dogger Bank during the deplorable incident of 1904, he had been\r\nsingularly silent about after the delivery of the Paris award: but the\r\nmost part of his follies survived.\r\n\r\nHe did at least pick up a new mania from time to time, which relieved\r\nthe tedium of his repeated dogmatisings; but his friends looked\r\nforward with horror to that inevitable phase which he must meet with\r\nadvancing years, when the elasticity of his fanaticism should fail him,\r\nand they should be compelled to listen to an unvarying tale throughout\r\nhis old age.\r\n\r\nHe was, as I have said, not fifty, but that phase seemed already\r\narrived in one particular. He had gone mad upon the Hebrew race.\r\n\r\nHe saw Jews everywhere: he not only saw them everywhere, but he saw\r\nthem all in conspiracy. He would not perhaps have told you that the\r\nconspiracy was conscious, but its effects he would have discovered all\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\nAccording to him Lombroso was a Jew, Mr. Roosevelt's friends and\r\nsupporters the Belmonts were Jews, half the moneyed backers of\r\nRoosevelt were Jews, the famous critic Brandes was a Jew, Zola was\r\na Jew, Nordau was a Jew, Witte was a Jew--or in some mysterious way\r\nconnected with Jews; Naquet was a Jew; the great and suffering Hertz\r\nwas a Jew. All actors and actresses _en bloc_, and all the foreign\r\ncorrespondents he could lay hands on were Jews; the late and highly\r\nrespected M. de Blowitz (a fervent Catholic!) he nicknamed \"Opper,\" and\r\nhaving found that a member of the very excellent West Country family\r\nof Wilbraham had ardently supported the Russian revolutionists in the\r\ncolumns of the _Times_, he must say, forsooth, that a certain \"Brahms\"\r\n(who rapidly developed into \"Abrahams\") was the inspirer of the premier\r\njournal; and this mythical character so wrought upon his imagination\r\nthat in a little while the manager of the paper itself, and heaven\r\nknows who else, were attached to the Synagogue.\r\n\r\nIn his eyes the governors of colonies, the wives of Viceroys, the\r\nholders of Egyptian bonds, the mortgagees of Irish lands, half the\r\nRussian patriots, and all the brave spokesmen of Hungary, were swept\r\ninto the universal net of his mania.\r\n\r\nIt got worse with every passing year: there were Jews at Oxford, and at\r\nCambridge, and at Trinity College, Dublin; the Jews overran India; they\r\ncontrolled the _Neue Frie Presse_ of Vienna, the _Tribuna_ of Rome, the\r\n_Matin_ of Paris, and for all I know, the _Freeman's Journal_ in Dublin.\r\n\r\nThe disease advanced with his advancing age; soon all the great family\r\nof Arnold were Jews; half the English aristocracy had Jewish blood; for\r\na little he would have accused the Pope of Rome or the Royal Family\r\nitself; and I need hardly say that every widespread influence, from\r\nFreemasonry to the international finance of Europe, was Israelite in\r\nhis eyes; while our Colonial policy, and especially the gigantic and\r\nsuccessful struggle in South Africa, he twisted into a sort of petty\r\nhuckstering, dependent upon Petticoat Lane.\r\n\r\nMary Smith loved her brother. She did all she could to dispel these\r\nmists and to bring out that decent side of him which had made him\r\nyears ago as popular a young man as any in London--but he was past\r\npraying for. A private income, large, like all the Bailey incomes,\r\nof over £4000 a year, permitted him a dangerous independence; and in\r\nhis freehold house in Bruton Street he lived his own life altogether,\r\nattached to his servants, whom he never changed, subscribing to absurd\r\nforeign papers that dripped with anti-Semitic virus, and depending upon\r\nthe perpetual attention of his manservant Zachary, an honest fellow\r\nenough, but one who, from perpetual association with his master, seemed\r\nto have imbibed something of that master's eccentricities. _He_ was as\r\ndandy as the gentleman who employed him was slovenly, and all Bruton\r\nStreet noted with a smile the extraordinary figure the fellow made when\r\nhe went out on his rare holidays, in a tight frock-coat, a hat like\r\npolished ebony, and gloves that were always new.\r\n\r\nTo individuals, as is so often the case with men of this temper and\r\nof good birth, William Bailey was often kind and sometimes positively\r\ngenerous. The personal enmities he bore to men whom he had actually\r\nknown, were very rare, and such as they were they would take the form\r\nrather of abstaining from their society than of intriguing against\r\nthem. Indeed, characters of this sort are not usually possessed of\r\nthat tenacity in action which intrigue requires. His name was mentioned\r\nwith no woman's; he had never married. In early youth he was supposed\r\nto have felt some attraction to a lady considerably older than himself,\r\nwho subsequently became the wife of another yet older than herself, an\r\nAnglo-Indian official of high standing. But the passion could hardly\r\nhave been deep or lasting, for he preserved no relic of her in any\r\nform; he had no picture of her, he never mentioned her name, and when\r\nshe returned to England from time to time, he made no effort to renew\r\nher acquaintance and seemed even to avoid her presence.\r\n\r\nSome have attempted to attribute his violent eccentricities of\r\njudgment to disappointed ambition. His career would hardly lead one\r\nto such a conclusion. As a boy he determined upon the Army, and had\r\ngreatly annoyed his family, who would have preferred the Guards, by\r\njoining the Engineers. He had not been four years a sapper when he as\r\nsuddenly abandoned that honourable and useful corps, and compelled his\r\nfather to use influence for his appointment as an _attaché_--of all\r\nplaces in the world--to Pekin. Transferred from that distant capital\r\nto Paris, he begged for Constantinople, was granted it, and within\r\ntwo years abandoned the career of diplomacy as light-heartedly as he\r\nhad abandoned that of arms. His father's death at this moment added\r\nto his already sufficient private means, and it was thought by such\r\nrelatives as still took some interest in his talents that commercial\r\nactivity would bring him into harness. A stall was purchased for him\r\nat Lloyds, and for three months he appeared to devote himself steadily\r\nto speculation. But the wisest of his relatives, especially his Aunt\r\nWinifred, still had their misgivings; they were amply justified.\r\n\r\nIn the election of 1892 which shortly followed his introduction to\r\nthe City, he was asked by the family to make a third candidate in\r\nEast Rutland in order to split, what was then called, the 'Liberal'\r\nvote against his brother James, who had presented himself in what was\r\nthen called the 'Conservative' interest. William Bailey, naturally\r\ngood-natured and thinking to enjoy the mild excitement of a short\r\ncampaign, was delighted to present himself as an Independent Liberal,\r\nand until within a few days of the poll, conducted himself as the\r\nsituation required, taking care to draw upon himself such votes--and\r\nno more--as might secure his brother's election. Unhappily the twisted\r\nspirit of the man got the better of him in the last week before the\r\npoll, and he fell into a deplorable breach of good taste and family\r\nfeeling; he suddenly began deliberately to attract the attention and\r\nwin the support of every sort of elector. To his own considerable\r\nsurprise (but it must be admitted to his secret gratification) he\r\nwas returned--with what consequent and final effect upon his family\r\nrelations need not be told!\r\n\r\nDuring the short life of that parliament he made himself conspicuous\r\nby abstaining from the narrow and perilous divisions to which his\r\nparty was subjected, by asking the most offensive personal questions\r\nof responsible Ministers, by shouting interjections which repeatedly\r\ncalled upon him the severe reprimand of the highly distinguished man\r\nwho then occupied the Chair, and by moving, when the luck of the\r\nballot fell his way, a motion so offensive to every loyal and generous\r\nfeeling, that even the Opposition found themselves compelled to support\r\nthe Government in an early adjournment to prevent its discussion.\r\n\r\nIn the early summer of 1895 he appeared to suffer a sudden conversion,\r\nspoke frequently in the most decent and weighty of parliamentary\r\nmanners, was present at every division, supported his colleagues in the\r\ncountry and then--utterly without warning--betrayed one of the safest\r\nseats in England by refusing at the General Election to present himself\r\nagain as a candidate.\r\n\r\nA man who acts thus in our public life bars every serious career\r\nagainst himself. Whether Mr. Bailey had foreseen this or no, he was at\r\nany rate content henceforward to live as a private gentleman in his\r\nlittle house in Bruton Street. But his restless temper still led him\r\nfrom one set to another, mingling with every one and seen everywhere.\r\nHe wrote, he occasionally spoke, and above all it was his delight,\r\nby insinuation or by direct disclosure, to embarrass and expose his\r\nfellow-beings; a man dangerous in the extreme, and, I repeat, one whom\r\nno society less tolerant than ours would have endured for a year.\r\n\r\nSuch was the rock on which the proud ship of Mr. Clutterbuck's good\r\nfortune struck.\r\n\r\nIn a mood less irritable and less inflamed he would have been safe; but\r\ndoubtful, suspicious, angered as he was he fell an easy--alas! too easy\r\na prey--to the inconsequent and empty enthusiast; and it was his ruin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck was back at The Plâs, and the thorn in his soul struck\r\nsore. Too many words were enigmas. He suffered too much silence. He\r\nwould speak.\r\n\r\nThey were together in the Art Gallery of The Plâs, Mr. Clutterbuck and\r\nCharlie, the Master and the Man.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck was sitting at a desk where he often did his work,\r\nunder the inspiration of the big Manet which Charlie had purchased that\r\nsummer of Raphael and Heinz. Fitzgerald was smoking a cigarette lazily\r\nat the end of the long room, and reading one of those articles in the\r\n_Spectator_ which have so profound an influence week by week upon the\r\npolitical situation.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck suddenly looked up from his writing, turned round to\r\nhim and said:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Fitzgerald, what is a Peabody Yid?\"\r\n\r\nCharlie Fitzgerald was so startled that he let the premier review\r\nof the Anglo-Saxon Race fall to the floor; but a glance at Mr.\r\nClutterbuck's honest though troubled profile reassured him.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, a Yid,\" he said laughing, \"I suppose a Yid's a name for a German,\r\nor something of that sort. Then Peabody--oh, the Peabody Buildings!\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it a kind of man, then?\" said Mr. Clutterbuck, solemnly.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" said Fitzgerald, thoughtfully, \"I suppose it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought it was one man,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck, still in doubt, and\r\nin a tone which made Charlie Fitzgerald look at him again, but again\r\nfeel reassured.\r\n\r\n\"It would be one fellow, of course,\" said Fitzgerald manfully, \"if\r\nyou were only speaking of one: if you said 'a Peabody Yid,' for\r\ninstance.... But if you were talking of several,\" he mused, \"why you'd\r\nsay 'Peabody Yids,' I s'pose. What?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck was lost in thought. \"But Yid means a Jew surely,\r\ndoesn't it, Mr. Fitzgerald?\" said the older man. \"It's a vulgar name\r\nfor a Jew, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why-y, yes,\" answered the other with nonchalance. \"A German, or a Jew,\r\nor something of that sort. Then Peabody was a sort of philanthropical\r\nfellow: architect, I think.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck having got so far, said: \"Oh!\" He said no more; he went\r\non writing; but, like the man in the Saga, his heart was ill at ease.\r\nFor the first time in many months he was as sore and as anxious as ever\r\nhe had been in the old days before good fortune came to him.\r\n\r\nThe seventh day of the New Year broke brightly, but never a word from\r\nPeter Street. Mr. Clutterbuck went so far as to speak first to his\r\nsecretary, before his secretary had spoken to him, and to ask him, but\r\nwith all the courtesy imaginable, whether something could not be done\r\nto reassure him?\r\n\r\nCharlie Fitzgerald more than hinted that it was all nervousness.\r\n\"Things aren't done in that way,\" he said worriedly. \"They won't give\r\nme anything in writing, of course.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck foresaw yet another futile verbal message and he came\r\nas near to anger as such a man can come at all. He was quite evidently\r\nput out and annoyed. He went so far as to say:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Fitzgerald, I did hope you would have done something for me.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Charlie, who had a fine sense which told him when he had gone too\r\nfar, got up and put a gentle hand on his employer's arm.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid, Mr. Clutterbuck,\" he said in a tone of low and grave\r\nsincerity, \"I'm afraid you misunderstood me. I can't do more than find\r\nout, but I'll find out in more detail, and you must give me two days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck, \"of course; you know what you have\r\nto do, Mr. Fitzgerald, I won't expect you back until I hear.\" But he\r\nadded in a sort of appealing voice: \"But do do something! You see\r\n... it touches a man's pride, and ... to be perfectly frank ... Mrs.\r\nClutterbuck doesn't like it. One feels odd when one's friends come.\"\r\n\r\nThe poor old gentleman was perfectly straightforward and it went to\r\nCharlie Fitzgerald's heart. Nevertheless a telegram which came for him\r\na few hours later, after he had sent a telephone message to London,\r\ndetained him yet another day. He fully explained to Mr. Clutterbuck the\r\nnature of the delay: the person whom he had expected to meet in town\r\nwould not be back till the evening of the 9th; but Mr. Clutterbuck was\r\nonly partially relieved and he announced his intention of seeing to\r\nsome business in the City. The business--alas! that I should have to\r\nadmit duplicity in such a character--was an interview with Mr. William\r\nBailey.\r\n\r\nThat eccentric had at least opened him one door of sympathy, and in Mr.\r\nClutterbuck's distress the business man's natural mistrust of uncertain\r\nand fantastic characters was forgotten.\r\n\r\nHe found Mr. Bailey occupying his worse than useless leisure in drawing\r\nup an enormous list of names, and by the side of each, in a second\r\ncolumn, a second name was appended. He was so engrossed upon this task,\r\nin the prosecution of which he was surrounded by twenty or a dozen\r\nbooks of reference, collections of newspaper cuttings and memoranda of\r\nevery sort, that he did not so much as look up when Zachary announced\r\nMr. Clutterbuck, but went on murmuring:\r\n\r\n\"Beaufort---- Rosenberg, date uncertain;\r\n\r\n\"Belvedere---- Cohen, 1873;\r\n\r\n\"Belmont---- Schoenberg, 1882 (probably)....\"\r\n\r\nHe had go so far when he jumped up, remembered his manners, and begged\r\nMr. Clutterbuck to excuse his absorption.\r\n\r\n\"I was making out a list of people,\" he said, \"a sort of dictionary.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to publish it?\" asked Mr. Clutterbuck politely, by way\r\nof beginning the conversation.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Bailey, \"I rather think I am. I dare say I should have\r\nto get it printed abroad, but that's no drawback.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope it's all right,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck in alarm.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, it's quite moral,\" said Mr. Bailey airily. \"But one often has\r\nto get things done abroad. Would you like to look at some of it?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck had the courtesy to glance at the yards of double names\r\nand dates, but they meant nothing to him. He asked which column one\r\nread first, and William Bailey could only find the stupid and would-be\r\nenigmatic reply that some read it one way and some read it the other.\r\n\r\n\"Beaufort equals Rosenberg, or Rosenberg equals Beaufort: it's all the\r\nsame thing. It's usually French on the left and German on the right,\"\r\nhe said quizzically, putting his head on one side. \"Middle Ages there,\r\nModern Ages here,\" he went on, wagging his head symbolically right and\r\nleft; and then suddenly broke out: \"What've you come to see me about?\r\nStill hanging fire?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck admitted that it was, and Mr. Bailey surveyed him with\r\ngreat kindness. It was evident the crank had no desire to eat up this\r\nparticular millionaire; he would give _him_ a certificate of pure\r\nblood. He smiled at his sister's new acquaintance with deep benediction\r\nand at last he said in a knowing tone:\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Mr. Clutterbuck, I think I can only do _one_ thing for you,\r\nbut it's a very useful thing. It's just a rule of thumb, and I'm afraid\r\nyou'll think it something in the dark; but it's no good making any more\r\nof it just now than a plain rule of thumb. It's just a plain rule of\r\nthumb.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck groaned inwardly. He was in the fog again. But William\r\nBailey went on quite composed:\r\n\r\n\"I know a good deal of things,\" he said, stretching his arms and\r\nyawning as he said it.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mr. Bailey, certainly,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck fervently.\r\n\r\n\"Well then, if I just tell you a simple little dodge--don't think it\r\ntoo simple--just take it as a tip from me, and I'll see you through.\r\nI mean what I say. I don't think I'd do it for anybody else. TRY THE\r\nANAPOOTRA RUBY MINES.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name of the Anapootra Ruby Mines--that name of power--left Mr.\r\nClutterbuck as blank as ever.\r\n\r\nIt couldn't be a medicine by the name of it, and if it was an\r\ninvestment, he hadn't come for any advice of _that_ sort. He thought he\r\nknew his way about _there_.\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand what you mean,\" he said a little bluntly, for of\r\nlate his courage had increased with his worries.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" said Mr. Bailey, as though it were the simplest thing in\r\nthe world, \"the Anapootra _Ruby_ Mines. Talk about 'em. Say you're\r\ninterested in 'em. It'll work marvels.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck was almost in despair.\r\n\r\n\"If that's all you got to tell me,\" he said----\r\n\r\nWilliam Bailey put a hand on his shoulder. \"Now there you are,\" he\r\nsaid, \"that's just what I was afraid of. I give you a tip--it isn't a\r\ntip I'd give anybody else, and it's the very best tip I could give you.\r\nAnd because you don't see _why_ it's a good tip, you're going to reject\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"No I'm not, Mr. Bailey, really I'm not,\" said the unfortunate\r\nClutterbuck. \"But I don't understand--upon my word I don't understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's there to understand?\" asked William Bailey. \"There are the\r\nAnapootra Ruby Mines, and you just talk about them; that's easy enough.\r\nYou bring them up at dinner; you add a postscript when you write a\r\nletter: 'By the way, have you heard about the Anapootra Ruby Mines?' Or\r\nyou open a paper and say to the company: 'It's funny, but I don't see\r\nanything about the Anapootra Ruby Mines to-day.' You mayn't see _why_\r\nit will work wonders, but it will. By the way, have you ever seen the\r\nname in a paper?\"\r\n\r\n\"I seem to have seen it somewhere,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck, not liking to\r\nconfess his ignorance.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you haven't,\" replied William Bailey rudely. \"You may bet your\r\nhat on that. If they'd been in the papers, there'd be nothing to talk\r\nabout. But _you_ talk about them long enough, and they'll get in the\r\npapers all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I don't see the connection,\" quavered Mr. Clutterbuck.\r\n\r\n\"Well, there it is,\" said William Bailey sighing, \"there's the tip. If\r\nyou try it and let it work, it will do marvels; and then you'll see\r\nwhat I've done.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what are they?\" persisted Mr. Clutterbuck.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, ruby mines!\" almost shouted William Bailey.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, certainly, but where?\"\r\n\r\n\"In Anapootra of course,\" said Bailey.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck rose to go with a joyless face.\r\n\r\n\"You come back to me when it begins to work, and I'll see you through,\"\r\nwere the last words of William Bailey, and his guest heard them ringing\r\nin his ears as he went mournfully to the train.\r\n\r\nIn The Plâs that very evening he tried it on. They were at their lonely\r\nmeal, all three, Charlie Fitzgerald, who inwardly wished he had got\r\naway, Mrs. Clutterbuck, and the master of the house. They dared not\r\nhave friends under such a cloud. Mr. Clutterbuck said casually to Mrs.\r\nClutterbuck:\r\n\r\n\"My dear, do you know anything of the Anapootra Ruby Mines?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Mrs. Clutterbuck sharply, and at the same time in a manner\r\nthat clearly showed she was bored. The City had always wearied her\r\nsince her husband's success; she hardly thought it quite the thing to\r\nspeak of it before Charlie Fitzgerald. As for that well-born youth, he\r\nremained quite silent and ate with singular rapidity the Mousseline\r\nBraganza à la Polignac which he had before him.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know anything about them?\" said Mr. Clutterbuck undaunted, and\r\nturning to Charlie Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\nHis wife issued one of her commanding glances, but he avoided it.\r\n\r\n\"The--Anapootra--Ruby--Mines?\" said Charlie Fitzgerald, hesitating\r\nbetween each syllable. \"No, I don't. I know about the _Brah_mapootra:\r\nit's a river.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck, and this singularly unfruitful\r\nconversation ended.\r\n\r\nBut Charlie Fitzgerald wondered and wondered more deeply what on earth\r\nhe was to do. His task had been difficult enough already; it was\r\nbecoming impossible.\r\n\r\nNext day he took his bag and was off, but he promised to be home before\r\nthe end of the week, and he promised still more sincerely, in private\r\nto Mr. Clutterbuck, to do everything that could possibly be done, and\r\nif he failed, to form some further plan. He was careful not to use any\r\nof the cars--he had used them quite enough lately, and the weather was\r\nfoul. He took the train in the common fashion and drove from Victoria\r\nstraight to Barnett House. The telephone had prepared them for his\r\nvisit, and the Duke of Battersea, always the kindest and the warmest of\r\nfriends to the young men of his rank, took him affectionately into the\r\ninner room, and heard all he might have to say.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Battersea, now well stricken in years, was of that kind\r\nwhich age matures and perfects.\r\n\r\nThe bitter struggles of his youth when, in part a foreigner, ill\r\nacquainted with our tongue and bewildered by many of our national\r\ncustoms, he had made his entry into English finance, had given him\r\nall the wisdom such trials convey, but they had left nothing of that\r\nbitterness too often bred in the souls of those who suffer. The failure\r\nof the Haymarket Bank would not indeed have checked so tenacious a\r\ncharacter, but the undeserved obloquy which he suffered in the few\r\nyears succeeding that misfortune, and during the period when it was\r\nfalsely imagined that he had finally failed, might have put him\r\nout of touch with the national life and have given him a false and\r\nuncharitable estimate of the country of his adoption. So far from\r\npermitting any such acidity to warp his soul, Mr. Barnett (as he then\r\nwas) had but the more faithfully gone forward in the path which destiny\r\noffered him, and he had reaped the reward which modern England never\r\nfails to give to those of her sons who have preserved, throughout all\r\nthe vicissitudes of life, a true sense of proportion and a proper\r\nbalance between material prosperity and the public service.\r\n\r\nWhen he had been raised to the peerage as Lord Lambeth, a vigorous man\r\nof fifty years, not only was his public position assured, but that\r\nrespect for a firm character and a just maintenance of a man's own\r\nestablishment in the world which should accompany such a position, was\r\ndeeply founded in the mind of the general public.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers, through which the great mass of our fellow citizens\r\nobtain their information, mentioned him not only continually, but with\r\ninvariable deference, and often with admiration. His efforts in the\r\nHouse of Lords in favour of Bosnian freedom, and in the particular\r\ncase of Macchabee Czernwitz, had proclaimed just that disinterested\r\nenthusiasm which we love to see applied by our great men to foreign\r\naffairs; while, nearer home, the Organ Grinders' Bill, for which he\r\nwas mainly responsible, was a piece of practical legislation which had\r\nobtained general recognition upon both sides of either House.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be wondered at, therefore, that when the M'Korio Delta\r\nDevelopment Company was taken over by the State, his connection with\r\nthat gallant experiment in the building of Empire, earned him a\r\npermanent fame more valuable than any material reward. He had long\r\nago severed all personal connection with the district, retaining only\r\nso many shares as permitted him to sit upon the Board, and it is\r\nno little tribute to this great Englishman to point out that after\r\nseventeen years, during which it had been impossible to pay a dividend,\r\nhe was able triumphantly to persuade a united public opinion and the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer to purchase the concession at par: more,\r\nhe handed over intact to the Crown not only the delta of the M'Korio\r\nRiver, but Mubu Otowa and the malarial district to the south of Tschè.\r\n\r\nIt was shortly after this achievement, in the year 1910, that he\r\nconsented--somewhat reluctantly--to an advance in honour and accepted\r\nthe Dukedom of Battersea.\r\n\r\nThe lower rungs of the ladder he had been willing to mount; but a\r\nnatural reserve had forbidden him hitherto to accede to the most\r\npressing entreaties from either Party. He had indeed kept aloof from\r\nparty politics, and had subscribed to the funds of the two great\r\norganisations only because he thought it his duty to enable men poorer\r\nthan himself to display their talents in the arena of Parliament and\r\nbecause he justly desired to preserve some power for righteousness with\r\nthe Executive of the moment.\r\n\r\nEven at this late hour, over seventy years of age, and prepared at\r\nany moment to answer the Great Summons, he would hardly have followed\r\nthe advice of his friend the Prime Minister in accepting the honour\r\nproposed to him, had not the task been rendered sadly easier to him by\r\none tragic accident: there was no longer an heir to his vast wealth\r\nand honourable name. The Master of Kendale (for such was the name\r\nof the old Scottish place), the handsome, intelligent boy with the\r\nbourbon nose, the wealth of black curls, proud full lips, and brilliant\r\neyes which had lent such life to so many reunions, the child of Lord\r\nLambeth's old age, his Ben-jamin was no more. The young soldier had\r\nlost his off stirrup only the summer before while trotting his yeomen\r\non parade before the royal visitors to the Potteries, and when he was\r\npicked up he was quite dead; the neck was broken between the second and\r\nthird cervical vertebræ.\r\n\r\nFor the old man the blow was terrible. Long widowed, all his hopes\r\nhad centred upon this only child whom, though not yet of age, he had\r\nalready begun to train in the great money which he was destined to\r\ninherit and control. For a moment he thought of giving up Barnett\r\nHouse--of resigning his affairs. At last he rallied, and the tragedy\r\nhad this good in it for England, that it permitted him to accept\r\nthe Dukedom, and perhaps also permitted him to continue, if only as\r\na solace, that active interest in the wider commerce of the Empire\r\nwherein his talents were of such fruit and value to his country.\r\n\r\nIt was in connection with these that the Duke of Battersea had\r\nundertaken the management of those Anapootra Ruby Mines, the quiet\r\ntransference of which to his able management had been the triumph of\r\nthe last vice royalty. Is it to be wondered at if Fitzgerald, fearing\r\nsuch interests were menaced, went to warn their chief protector?\r\n\r\nHe was brief and clear. The Ruby Mines were out. They must be well out\r\nor old Clutterbuck wouldn't have heard of them, and old Clutterbuck had.\r\n\r\nNo words of mine are needed to defend the commercial honour of the\r\nDuke of Battersea; still less need I waste a moment's effort in an\r\napology for our great Civil Service. It needs men of a very different\r\ncalibre from Mr. Bailey to throw doubt upon the absolute integrity of\r\nour Imperial system; and the last Lieutenant-Governor of Anapootra\r\nin particular, deservedly boasting a host of friends, intensely\r\nlaborious, honourably poor, would have cause for complaint if even\r\nan eulogy of him, let alone a defence, were undertaken here. But in\r\norder to comprehend the foolish and treasonable agitation Mr. Bailey\r\nhoped to raise, it is necessary that I should put down plainly all the\r\ncircumstances of the venture.\r\n\r\nFor many centuries the ruby mines of Anapootra had been worked as the\r\nproperty of that native State. And when the administration of the\r\nvalley was taken over by Great Britain the exploitation of the mines\r\nvery naturally followed. From April 1 of the year 1905 they had become,\r\nalong with certain other possessions of the State, a portion of the\r\npublic domain.\r\n\r\nThe traditional methods by which their wealth had hitherto been\r\nexploited were wholly insufficient. A community of some hundreds of\r\nnatives, working upon a complex, co-operative system, living in a\r\nmiserable state of poverty and degradation, had paid, from immemorial\r\ntime, a fixed percentage of their output to their Sovereign; and the\r\nhumanitarian faddism of Sir Charles Finchley--whose appointment was one\r\nof the few mistakes of Lord Curzon's viceroyalty--had permitted this\r\nsystem to endure during the first few years of our occupation. But it\r\nwas obvious that so primitive an arrangement could not endure. In 1910\r\nthere was but one question before the new Lieutenant-Governor; whether\r\nit would be more profitable to establish a direct exploitation of these\r\nmines by the Crown, or to concede that exploitation for a term of years\r\nto some company which, under expert advice and with long experience of\r\nthe business, might secure a higher profit to the State. It was only\r\nafter deep thought and the full consideration of every detail, that\r\nthe Lieutenant-Governor decided upon the latter course and signed a\r\nconcession to a private company for a term of fifteen years.\r\n\r\nHe further determined--and it was the act of a strong man--to avoid\r\nthe disadvantages of public competition with its accompaniment of\r\nill-informed and often unpatriotic criticism, of questions in the House\r\nof Commons, and of all the paraphernalia of ignorance and cant.\r\n\r\nHe made the concession boldly to a company of his own choice, and\r\nthough he was not particularly concerned with the persons involved so\r\nlong as the company itself was in his opinion honest and efficient,\r\nhe was none the less delighted to learn that so great a financier as\r\nthe Duke of Battersea had guaranteed its position and security--nay,\r\nwas himself, in his capacity of the Anglo-Moravian Bank, the principal\r\nshareholder in the new venture.\r\n\r\nIt is ill work excusing any man so talented and honest, so devoted to\r\nthe public service, as the late Lieutenant-Governor of Anapootra, but\r\nthe criticism to which he has been subjected makes that task necessary,\r\nhowever painful.\r\n\r\nThe concession signed was, upon the face of it, just such a document as\r\npolitical puritans at home, ignorant as they are of local conditions,\r\nwould pounce upon in their desire to vent their ill-informed suspicion\r\nof their own countrymen. The rent to be paid by the company was but a\r\nquarter of that originally paid by the native workers, and less than\r\na tenth of that which official estimates of the yield under modern\r\nmethods had contemplated. Moreover, no rent was to be paid before\r\n1915, the fourth year of the concession, and there were to be rebates\r\nin case the company should come upon weak pockets or the supply should\r\nfall below a certain level in the interval for which the concession\r\nwas granted. Those of my readers who are acquainted with the details\r\nof finance will at once perceive that these advantages were no more\r\nthan what was necessary to tempt a private venture and the risk of\r\nprivate capital. But if any _not_ acquainted with large financial\r\noperations should have lingering doubts, it is enough to add that the\r\nLieutenant-Governor of Anapootra had been so scrupulously careful of\r\nthe public interest as to resign his post and to terminate a great\r\npro-consular career in order to accept the directorship of the new\r\ncompany where he could overlook its action and check its contributions\r\nto the exchequer. He was determined that no sacrifice upon his part\r\nshould be spared in his zeal for the public fortune.\r\n\r\nHe did more: he persuaded the chief Government expert upon the mines to\r\nthrow up _his_ secure place, the prospect of his pension--everything,\r\nand to take at a somewhat increased salary the position of Consulting\r\nEngineer to the new Company.\r\n\r\nHe did yet more. He, a man suffering from a grave internal disease,[8]\r\nunderwent, in the height of the hot season, the long journey to\r\nEngland in order to impress upon the Secretary of State[9] the prime\r\nimportance of secrecy. He risked what was dearer than life to him--his\r\nvery honour--for a venture which would ensure riches to England, and\r\nwould bring enlightenment and modern progress to one far forgotten\r\ncorner of the Indian world.\r\n\r\nIn a word, he left nothing undone which a sensitive and scrupulous\r\ngentleman should do to preserve the interests of his country, and in\r\nall this action he sought no fame, he permitted not a word to appear in\r\nthe public Press; he went so far--it was quixotic upon his part--as to\r\ndeny all rumours until the plan was complete. And though the fame of\r\nthe Anapootra Valley has since widely increased through the lucrative\r\noperations of the new company, and the wide dispersion of its shares\r\namong the public, its former Lieutenant-Governor has to this day\r\nsuccessfully prevented his name from being connected with the history\r\nof that great new asset in our commercial system.\r\n\r\nOther nations have public servants perhaps better trained in a\r\ntechnical sense than are ours, but no nation can boast a body of men\r\nwho will thus obscurely and without reward sacrifice themselves wholly\r\nin the public service and be content to remain unknown.\r\n\r\nThere is the whole truth upon the Anapootra Ruby Mines.\r\n\r\nThe reader who has followed the plain narrative put before him will\r\nbe able to judge between it and the monstrous assumption upon which\r\nMr. Bailey was prepared to conduct, or at any rate to initiate, his\r\nmischievous agitation.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity with which that agitation developed was embarrassing, even\r\nto a man so used to immediate decisions as the Duke of Battersea. To\r\nthe ex-Lieutenant-Governor, whom his long and faithful public service\r\nin the tropics had deprived of digestion and had rendered partially\r\ndeaf, it was appalling.\r\n\r\nIt was upon Tuesday afternoon, January 8, 1912, that Mr. Bailey,\r\nlooking up at the ceiling, had launched the fatal words. It was upon\r\nTuesday evening that Mr. Clutterbuck had repeated them in the presence\r\nof Fitzgerald: thanks to the prompt and loyal action of that strong\r\nyoung Irish soul, the Duke knew of them before Wednesday noon.\r\n\r\nForewarned is forearmed:--the malignant plot was at last defeated--but\r\nat what a sacrifice of honest ambition and happy lives the reader must\r\nlearn and curse the name of William Bailey.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCharlie Fitzgerald sat long with the aged Duke--though there was\r\nlittle to say. He received with deference and grateful willingness\r\nthe suggestion to be of service in a matter where written words were\r\nimpossible. He made a note of whom he was to visit; how high he was to\r\ngo in the event of some agency threatening to print the story of the\r\nCompany; what he was to say to the editor by telephone, and what by\r\nletter to the Secretary of State. He proved that afternoon a second son\r\nto the old childless man, and when he had dined alone with him, and\r\nadmired the new Rodin on the stairs, he went off to Scotland in the\r\nmidnight sleeper to see the ex-Governor before the post should reach\r\nhim. He was prepared to do all this and more for the Duke of Battersea,\r\nand the Duke was a grateful man.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next morning's post was something of a trial to Mr. Clutterbuck\r\nin the absence of his secretary. He had learnt to depend upon that\r\nprop altogether, and at any other time he would have allowed all the\r\nletters which were not, by the handwriting, the letters of friends to\r\naccumulate unopened; but that day, January 10, 1912, that Thursday,\r\nhe was too anxious to do any such thing. He opened one letter, then\r\nanother; the third positively stupefied him. It was from his agent\r\nin Mickleton, and simply told him that a petition was to be lodged\r\ndisputing the validity of his election. They had learnt the news upon\r\nthe Wednesday evening.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck was an honest man.\r\n\r\nThe occasions on which it is possible to bring against a man of English\r\nlineage the grave accusation of tampering with political morals are\r\nvery, very rare; still rarer, thank God, are the occasions on which\r\nsuch an accusation can be maintained.\r\n\r\nIn vain did Mr. Clutterbuck--all his energies on the strain as\r\nthey used to be in the old days of commerce--minutely examine his\r\nexperiences of the month before. He could not discover a word or a\r\ngesture of his or any act authorised by him, even indirectly, which\r\ncould have led to so monstrous an accusation. His sense of honour felt\r\nthe thing keenly, and the agent's letter trembled in the hand that\r\nheld it. Then, like a clap of thunder, came the memory of the bag of\r\nsovereigns and the Bogey Man.\r\n\r\nHe had been assured and reassured that it was a common practice\r\nadmitted in all elections: he knew, upon perfectly good evidence, that\r\nanother Bogey Man had done the same ritual and necessary act for Lord\r\nHenfield. It was without a doubt a fixed custom in every election.\r\nThe sum was small; it was a fair wage for honest work openly done.\r\nNevertheless the memory of the actual metal weighed intolerably upon\r\nMr. Clutterbuck's ill ease.\r\n\r\nThat had done it! The only other source he could think of was his\r\nwife, and he knew her too well to suspect her of any foolish and\r\nill-considered act of charity which might have compromised his chances.\r\n\r\nAs for the half-sovereign, the wicked little half-sovereign, his lawyer\r\nhad completely satisfied him. The return of it cleared him wholly. No!\r\nIt was the Bogey Man, and there was no help for it.\r\n\r\nHe went in at once to see Mr. Bailey. He forgot to telephone: he was\r\nin an agony lest that one friend and stay should be out. But there he\r\nfound him again, still at his international list, which had now got as\r\nfar as the \"M's,\" \"Montague--Samuel, 1883 (Gladstone).\"\r\n\r\nThis time he did not forget his manners. He met the merchant with great\r\nsympathy, and looking at him a little critically, said with good cheer:\r\n\r\n\"It's begun to work, you see!\" He had seen about the petition in the\r\npapers.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck did not even hope to understand. \"Oh, Mr. Bailey,\" he\r\nsaid. \"Mr. Bailey, what on earth am I to do?\"\r\n\r\nTo this Mr. Bailey returned the irrelevant reply: \"Go on talking about\r\nthe Anapootra Ruby Mines!\" as though that action were a sort of panacea\r\nfor the disturbed heart of man. It was bitter mockery in the ear of\r\none whose greatest hopes were thus dashed at the end of a long and\r\nhonourable life.\r\n\r\n\"I had expected more from you, Mr. Bailey,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck\r\ngravely.\r\n\r\nWilliam Bailey was again touched.\r\n\r\n\"I mean it, Clutterbuck,\" he said; \"I really mean it. All medicines\r\nare bitter at first; it's a big business, but it's the right way--I do\r\nassure you it's the right way. I suppose you've written about those\r\nRuby Mines--postscripts, eh? A few cards I hope? A word or two to\r\nfriends in the train? Mentioned them to the servants? They're very\r\nuseful, servants are! Oh, and by the way, I ought to have told you--the\r\nparson. Parsons are splendid; so are doctors. But you can't have done\r\nthem all yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Bailey,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck solemnly, \"I haven't opened my lips\r\nin the matter; at least,\" he added, correcting himself, \"only to my\r\nwife at dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Charlie 'Fitzgerald' was there no doubt. My Cousin Charlie?\" asked\r\nWilliam Bailey pleasantly. \"I've just got past him on my list--at least\r\nnot him, but his grandfather. 'Daniels--Fitzgerald 1838.' Jolly old man\r\nhis grandfather, but a little greasy--I remember him. He was called\r\nDaniels--Daniel Daniels; son of old Moss Daniels, the Dublin sheeny,\r\nthat came to people's help, you know; you ought to know about the\r\nDaniels; very old family; we used to call his wife's drawing-room the\r\nlions' den. She was my aunt, you know,\" he added cheerfully. \"Cousin\r\nof mine, is Charlie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but Mr. Bailey,\" groaned Mr. Clutterbuck, leaving all these\r\nirrelevancies aside, \"what _am_ I to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, let 'em have it,\" said William Bailey in the serenity of his\r\ndissociation from politics and every other vanity.\r\n\r\n\"Let 'em unseat me!\" shrieked Mr. Clutterbuck.\r\n\r\n\"You can't help it,\" said Mr. Bailey, \"eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"But they can't prove anything,\" said his guest. He was excited and\r\ndefiant. \"There's nothing to prove!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, come,\" said Mr. Bailey, \"come Mr. Clutterbuck. Don't go on like\r\nthat. If they're going to unseat you, they're going to unseat you. And\r\nwhat's being unseated? Old Buffle was unseated three times.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should die of it!\" said Mr. Clutterbuck with a groan.\r\n\r\n\"No you won't,\" said Mr. Bailey. \"The Lord shall make your enemies\r\nyour footstool; or, at any rate, His agent on earth will give you a\r\ngood day's sport with them. Meanwhile you go on with those Ruby Mines.\r\nAnd, wait a minute, there's something to do to keep your mind off it\r\nmeanwhile: there's a good agency in Fetter Lane; they have a lot of\r\nfirst-rate men. I remember a man called Bevan who did some very good\r\nwork for an enemy of mine a little time ago. Go and give them a tenner\r\nand get them to find out who was behind that petition; though I think I\r\nknow already. I'll come with you.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe two men went eastward together, Mr. Bailey talking of a thousand\r\nimprobable things on the way, and they laid the task before the very\r\ncourteous manager, who assured them it would be the simplest thing in\r\nthe world. And so it was, for they learnt the same evening that though\r\nthe petition had been lodged by a large grocer of the name of Hewlett\r\nin Mafeking Avenue, the real mover in the affair was a workman resident\r\nin a small street off the Crescent, a casual labourer of the name of\r\nSeale.\r\n\r\n\"That's all right,\" said Mr. Bailey when the news came to them as they\r\nsat at dinner together. \"You won't find out that way. They been got at.\r\nThat's a tenner wasted,\" he added anxiously, \"but I'll pay it--I gave\r\nthe advice. You go back home, and I'll let you know everything I hear\r\nwithin two days.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Clutterbuck went home a little, but only a little, comforted;\r\nfeeling that he had indeed one ally--but what an ally! A man who talked\r\nin enigmas, a _dilettante_ with wild theories in which he himself\r\nonly half believed; a man half ostracised, half tolerated, and wholly\r\ndespised, but a man in the swim, anyhow: the memory of that consoled\r\nMr. Clutterbuck.\r\n\r\nTwo days afterwards Charlie Fitzgerald returned. His story was\r\nperfectly concise, too concise, alas, for that stricken household.\r\nHe did not bother them with his visit to the Duke of Battersea and\r\nto Scotland--he spoke only of their own business. He had seen Peter\r\nStreet yet once again. They were sorry, but it had happened from having\r\ntoo many names on the list; some had to wait; they admitted they had\r\npostponed Mr. Clutterbuck's name to Paardeberg Day, when there was a\r\nbatch of thirty to bring out.\r\n\r\n\"But now there's the Petition,\" said Charlie Fitzgerald a little\r\nawkwardly; \"you see under the circumstances----\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck with a grim face.\r\n\r\n\"Don't take it like that,\" said Charlie Fitzgerald, \"they can't prove\r\nanything. It's only a bit of spite.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what I was saying to-day,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck. And the\r\nAnapootra Ruby Mines were forgotten--but Mr. Bailey had not forgotten\r\nthem!\r\n\r\nThe horror of the Member--of the still Member for Mickleton, of the\r\nMember for Mickleton in the National Party interest--was as deep as\r\nhell when he received by post a marked copy of a low Socialist rag,\r\nwhose name he barely knew, and there under the title \"What We Don't\r\nHear,\" was a jeering allusion to the Anapootra mines, coupled with a\r\nlaudatory account of himself as the champion of popular rights. Next\r\nday a severe but obscure rebuke connecting his name with an unworthy\r\npiece of demagogy appeared in the _Standard_. A little later a fine\r\ndefence of his courage was included in a letter to the _Guardian_. Mr.\r\nClutterbuck was in terror of the unknown, and everywhere the dreadful\r\nsound of Anapootra haunted him. He walked over the Downs to clear his\r\nbrain; he sat down in the little inn at Ragman's Corner, where they\r\nalways gave him a private room and treated him as the chief gentleman\r\nof their neighbourhood. He had hardly tasted his glass of sherry when\r\nthe publican said to him with cheerful respect:\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, I see you've started another hare, and I wish you luck,\r\nsir. Here's to the People!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck turned pale; but when the publican had finished his\r\nglass and wiped his mouth with his finger, he did not fail to add:\r\n\r\n\"Here's to you, sir, and the Putrid Ruby Mines, whatever they may be,\r\nand good luck to the lot!\"\r\n\r\nOh the agony of an isolated man! Oh, passion of humanity, when it\r\ncan find no fellow on whom to repose! The violent agitation of youth\r\nreturned to his aged blood as he went home in the dark January\r\nevening, and he almost feared that the belated peasants whom he met so\r\nrarely as he hurried home, would each of them whisper as they passed\r\nthe hateful name of Anapootra; that some evil shape would start from\r\nthe darkness and scream it in his ear.\r\n\r\nFor a day or two the agony endured. Visitors and guests, the parson in\r\nhis weekly visit, the doctor who had come to advise him upon the nature\r\nof his port, all in varied tones slyly or gravely, or with astonishment\r\nor casually, all brought in the Accursed Thing.\r\n\r\nThe _Times_--and he loved them for it--had not printed a word; but\r\nthe _Spectator_, keen and breezy as it is, and abreast of every new\r\ninterest in English life, had published an honourable protest; the\r\neditor was sure that a man who was in the forefront of the heroes who\r\nhad redeemed the Congo would not sully his name by a disreputable\r\nagitation against his fellow countrymen; while, in another sphere, the\r\n_Winning Post_, as he knew by a secret peep taken at the bookstall,\r\npositively had a cartoon of a vague ghastly thing labelled \"The\r\nAnapootra Ruby Mines,\" and a little figure, undoubtedly himself,\r\nsupporting it with difficulty in the face of a violent gale.\r\n\r\nThen after a few days his mood gradually changed. Mr. Clutterbuck\r\nbegan to take a secret pride in his connection with these Gemmiferous\r\nCaves of the Orient. There was no doubt at all that for the second time\r\nin two months he was a public man; a martyr perhaps in a public cause.\r\nGreatness began to apparel him, and side by side with the case of Rex\r\n_v._ Fishmonger and Another, which he understood in a certain fashion,\r\nthe Anapootra Ruby Mines--still a complete mystery to him--supported\r\nhis growing fame.\r\n\r\nOne inept Radical sheet went so far as to suggest that he was the\r\ncat's-paw of the wicked men who had perpetrated that fraud upon their\r\ncountry, but the greater part, especially of the Democratic press,\r\nnobly maintained his integrity, and said they would see him through to\r\nthe end.\r\n\r\nHis new publicity consoled him a crumb, a mere crumb, in the prospect\r\nof the dreadful days before him. He sometimes indulged the inward hope\r\nthat no evidence could unseat a man now so deservedly the darling of\r\na Public cause; in the intervals when this consolation failed him, he\r\nfell back upon the memory of his integrity and unblemished if short\r\npublic life; he had assured and reassured himself as to the Bogey Man,\r\nand he was at last at ease upon the bag of gold. The consciousness of\r\nhis innocence out-weighed the gloomy prophecies of William Bailey,\r\nand as the days passed the memory of that gentleman's forecast grew\r\npaler and faded away. But the passage of the days brought with it also\r\nthe time of the election petition; there was a week, five days--four.\r\nOn the last Monday he sat for an hour or two with Charlie--who was of\r\ncourse to give evidence--they considered every aspect, and could see no\r\nloophole for attack. On the morrow they went into Mickleton together,\r\nand as they passed at speed through the streets of the borough they\r\nseemed to him too silent; even the police he thought--it may have been\r\nbut fancy--but even the police, he could have sworn, were colder and\r\nmore formal than of yore.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Liver.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Then (in 1911) Mr. Buffle.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe court in which the Mickleton election petition was to be heard\r\nsat in the Town Hall of that borough, and the first day, Tuesday, was\r\noccupied in formalities, but even so the end of the great room set\r\naside for the public was crowded.\r\n\r\nThe main part of the business was taken the next morning, the\r\nproceedings were short--and they proved decisive. After a few\r\nunimportant witnesses had been called--their testimony was very\r\ninconclusive--Mr. Stephens was heard. To the member's intense relief\r\nnot a word passed upon the Bogey Man, not a word upon the bag of\r\nsovereigns, for the inquiry was conducted with honour, and the\r\nconventions of our elections were allowed. When Mr. Clutterbuck heard\r\nthat his own secretary was to be examined, he could not but feel\r\nconfident in the result, but the spectacle of one whom he trusted\r\nand who was his right hand throughout the struggle being used by the\r\nlawyers against himself, was a thing Mr. Clutterbuck very properly\r\nresented. He silenced his anger by remembering that justice will have\r\nits course.\r\n\r\nCharlie Fitzgerald gave his evidence in that simple, direct way which\r\nshould be a model for us all; he answered every question in few words,\r\nneither embellishing nor concealing anything. He admitted the very\r\nconsiderable influence of the Fishmonger Relief Committee, and was\r\nproceeding to estimate the ten or twelve thousand it had spent for\r\nhis employer, when Sir John Compton at once interfered and ruled the\r\nevidence out. It had been clearly laid down in three precedents that an\r\nindependent organisation was free to spend what sums it saw fit so long\r\nas those funds did not proceed from the pocket of the candidate or his\r\nagent.\r\n\r\nThe thing seemed settled and Mr. Clutterbuck was breathing again\r\ntowards the close of that day, when counsel in a tone ominously calm,\r\nsaid shortly:\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mr. Fitzgerald, will you tell us where you were between half past\r\nnine and midnight, of Monday the 6th of November of last year?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Fitzgerald remembered the hour and day and all the events with\r\ntruly remarkable accuracy. He said with perfect frankness that he had\r\nspent the evening going in a cab from the Curzon Arms to the Mother\r\nBunch; from the Mother Bunch to the Harvest Home; from the Harvest\r\nHome to the Drovers, from the Drovers to the Naked Man; from the Naked\r\nMan to the Adam and Eve; and from the Adam and Eve to the Prince of\r\nWales's Feathers; he could not be absolutely certain of the order but\r\nit was more or less as he had stated it.\r\n\r\nThose in court who did not understand the nature of the confession\r\nbegan to smile, but in a few moments they saw the drift of the\r\nexamination when counsel put this perfectly plain demand:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Fitzgerald, think carefully: did you or did you not offer a glass\r\nof whiskey in the Prince of Wales's Feathers to one Alfred Arthur\r\nPound?\"\r\n\r\n\"I offered a glass of whiskey to him and to several gentlemen,\" said\r\nCharlie Fitzgerald openly.\r\n\r\n\"You offered whiskey to these electors, Mr. Fitzgerald?\" said counsel.\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't see,\" began Charlie Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\nBut the Bench at once interrupted. \"You are not here, witness, to tell\r\nus what you saw or what you did not see. You are here to give us your\r\nevidence.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Charlie Fitzgerald was silent. He was asked further questions. He\r\nhad given whiskey to various citizens at the Curzon Arms, at the Naked\r\nMan, at the Adam and Eve, and in fact at every public-house but one\r\nupon the whole of that night. And of the men who could be traced, every\r\none of whom gave evidence upon oath in rapid succession, no less than\r\n72·6 per cent. possessed votes in the constituency.\r\n\r\nThe finding of the commission was very brief; it could not be\r\notherwise after what they had heard. They emphasised in the strongest\r\npossible manner Mr. Clutterbuck's own innocence in the affair. The\r\nBench affirmed in the most flattering and emphatic terms that a more\r\nhonourable man than Mr. Clutterbuck had not appeared in the arena of\r\nour public life.\r\n\r\nFitzgerald also, in spite of what had proved a lamentable imprudence,\r\nwas heartily and gladly exonerated of any attempt to corrupt that high\r\nstandard of purity which is the glory of our public life. Sir John\r\nCompton was careful to add that no shadow of suspicion rested on Mr.\r\nStephens; he was willing to exonerate Alfred Arthur Pound. But there\r\nwas no choice offered to a reasonable man, before whom the facts had\r\nbeen presented; though most certainly no one had intended corruption\r\nor pressure in any form--_that_, he hoped, was absent from our public\r\nlife--yet it was plain that within three weeks of the poll a large\r\nnumber of electors had received a benefit especially defined by statute\r\nas illegal and had received it at the hands of one virtually acting\r\n(though of course in complete innocence of any unworthy motive) for\r\nthe gentleman who was candidate for the borough. Even had there been\r\nno such statute or definition, the conclusion was plain, and it was\r\ntheir very painful but solemn duty to declare, in accordance with the\r\nevidence they had heard--evidence Sir John Compton was careful to point\r\nout, which no one had attempted to rebut, and which he, for his part,\r\nhad very fully believed, that the election was invalid.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck jumped up wildly:\r\n\r\n\"Oh my Lord!\" he said.\r\n\r\nBut his counsel pulled him sharply by the coat tail, tearing in so\r\ndoing, I am sorry to say, the seam by which that appendage is sometimes\r\nattached to the upper part of the garment; while Mr. Justice Paisley,\r\nwho had hitherto been silent, sternly ordered him to be seated.\r\n\r\nOnce again within six months the Borough of Mickleton was widowed of\r\nits proud share in the administration of our land.\r\n\r\nWhether it would or would not be disfranchised for a period of years\r\nwas a matter which little concerned the unhappy man upon whom the blow\r\nhad fallen. He walked distractedly away at such a pace that it was\r\nsome hundred yards before Fitzgerald had caught him up and attempted\r\nto quiet his perturbation. To his first mood of despair was rapidly\r\nbeing added a second mood of anger and outraged justice, but he was\r\nhonourable enough not to lay to the poor young man's account the\r\nterrible misfortune that had befallen himself. He did not forget all\r\nthat Fitzgerald had done for him during the critical days of the\r\nelection, and he was grateful even now for the many services rendered\r\nby one without whom his first and ephemeral success would never have\r\nbeen won.\r\n\r\nNevertheless he insisted, as the reader may well imagine, in seeking\r\nsome relief in the company of William Bailey, and Charlie, after a\r\nmoment's hesitation, was too wise to dissuade him.\r\n\r\nHe left his employer at the door in Bruton Street, with an appointment\r\nto meet later in the evening, and the broken man was ushered by Zachary\r\ninto that familiar room, where he waited in a dull agony for his\r\nmentor's return.\r\n\r\nIt was a full half-hour before William Bailey came in. He had been\r\nhurriedly told in the hall what visitor he had. He had not troubled to\r\nlook at the tape at his Club; he was pretty certain of the result, and\r\nthere was a sort of I-told-you-so look on his face as he greeted Mr.\r\nClutterbuck, which did little to raise that gentleman's spirits.\r\n\r\nIt was a foolish thing to ask, but Mr. Clutterbuck did ask William\r\nBailey what he was to do.\r\n\r\nWilliam Bailey answered without hesitation that he could do nothing.\r\n\"Unless indeed,\" he added, \"you care to act and to lead from outside;\r\nyou can still do that. One good meeting by an unseated member can do\r\nmore against a Government than a dozen questions in the House. D'you\r\ncare to try? It's risky, you know.... They'll put the whole thing into\r\ncourt and muzzle you; and you'll have to speak before Parliament opens\r\nalso, because on the first day it'll be called out of order unless\r\nthere's a really _strong_ press outside.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck was in a mood for anything. What he was to do, or why,\r\nwas quite beyond him; but there was to be a meeting and it would hurt\r\nthose who had hurt him: so much he saw.\r\n\r\n\"Other men have done it,\" said William Bailey, citing examples from a\r\nless orderly past, \"and you can do it if you like.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm willing enough,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck, setting his teeth. \"You\r\nmean,\" he added, brilliantly concealing his ignorance; \"you mean, I'm\r\nto go on about the mines?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it,\" said William Bailey.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck, his head sinking upon his shoulders\r\nagain, \"you'll have to do it, Mr. Bailey. I can't see or think or plan;\r\nand I don't know what the Anapootra can do for me or any one, supposing\r\nI did----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nonsense,\" said Mr. Bailey briskly, \"a man must do what he can;\r\nyou can't get your seat again by main force. You can't get the other\r\nthings you want right off the shelf by helping yourself. You must go\r\non pressing and pressing. It's the only way--it's the one way in which\r\nanything gets done. Besides which, it's enough to make any man----\"\r\n\r\n\"You're right there,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck eagerly; \"it's enough to\r\nmake any man take action. What will you do, Mr. Bailey?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bailey, when he had to form a rapid plan, gave a sort of false\r\nimpression of rapidity and strength which had deceived many. He mapped\r\nout all the dates.\r\n\r\n\"You know the Directors are going for libel against the _Courier_?\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck didn't know it.\r\n\r\n\"Well, but they are. To-day's Wednesday, and it will be before the\r\ncourts to-day week, next Wednesday,\" he said. \"Once it's before the\r\ncourts you'll go to choke if you speak about it; so will any other\r\nJohnny except in Parliament; besides which, Parliament meets the same\r\nday, and what's more, I'm not at all sure they'd allow it even in\r\nQuestions, and there won't be any Questions until Wednesday, and by\r\nthat time, as I say, unless we get steam up outside it'll be out of\r\norder. Monday's no good, you can't get people on Monday. It'll take a\r\nday to get the posters up, and the advertisements and to dry them.\r\nWe'll say Saturday--Saturday at eight, in the Jubilee Hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"What for?\" said his slower minded companion.\r\n\r\n\"For the meeting of course,\" said Mr. Bailey in surprise; \"for the\r\ngreat meeting of protest by the ex-Member from Mickleton, on the\r\nAnapootra Ruby Mines!\"\r\n\r\nFor all Mr. Clutterbuck's determination he was somewhat appalled. \"I'm\r\nnot at all sure that I should speak, well I--I don't know even what or\r\nwho ...\" he began slowly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh that's all right,\" cut in William Bailey eager for the fray. \"I'll\r\nwrite your speech out, and I'll introduce you on the platform. It's the\r\n_name_ we want, and your power in the constituency. They know _that_.\r\nThe papers won't dare boycott it, and you'll get the horny-handed in\r\nthousands. We'll have a grand time!\"\r\n\r\nHe said it with the irresponsibility of a boy, but that mood is\r\ndangerous in a man.\r\n\r\nSo was it decided that on the next Saturday, before Parliament opened,\r\nand before the matter was, to be classical, _sub-judice_, a great\r\nmeeting should be held and the ball set rolling by Mr. Clutterbuck,\r\nChampion of the People; but the Champion was torn between fear and\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck when he reached the Plâs, was careful to keep the\r\nmeeting even from his wife. He told it to none but Fitzgerald.\r\nFitzgerald was sympathetic and it felt like old times.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in London, Mr. Bailey had hired the Jubilee Hall, and, if it\r\nwere necessary for overflow, the Coronation Annex.\r\n\r\nThe next day he spent some hours with Mr. Clutterbuck, drilling his\r\nspeech into him with unwearied repetition; and Charlie Fitzgerald,\r\nhaving nothing better to do, called on his dear old friend the Duke\r\nof Battersea, and passed with him a most delightful afternoon. Mr.\r\nClutterbuck and Fitzgerald met at Victoria. The merchant and his\r\nsecretary went home together. And that same evening the Duke of\r\nBattersea did what he had to do.\r\n\r\nA telephone message to the Prime Minister's house and the assurance of\r\na hearty welcome, made what he had to do easier for him. He found that\r\nstatesman, still spirited and young in spite of his increasing trouble\r\nwith the left lung, crouched over the fire, spreading his hands to the\r\nblaze. He talked to him of various things: of the session that was\r\nabout to open, of the plague in Burmah, of Mrs. Kempton's latest book.\r\nHe said a few words about Mr. Bailey, and casually mentioned the step\r\nwhich that gentleman was apparently about to take.\r\n\r\nFor a man in such doubtful health (and for one before whom such arduous\r\nduties immediately lay) the Prime Minister was quite vivacious in his\r\nreplies. He differed from the Duke of Battersea with regard to Mrs.\r\nKempton's latest book, and criticised her attitude towards Malthus. He\r\nspoke cheerfully of the coming session though he joked a little about\r\nthe smallness of the majority; he was very grave indeed about the\r\nplague in Burmah--and he said nothing at all about Mr. Bailey.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Battersea remained not more than twenty minutes. It was\r\nhis interest to show his sympathy with the Prime Minister's illness\r\nrather than to detain him in conversation, and he could understand\r\nthat the amusing story of Mr. Bailey's fanatical outburst would be\r\ntouched on lightly or passed in silence by a man who sat in the same\r\nCabinet with Lord Burpham; for after all, Lord Burpham's son, since the\r\nDuchess of Drayton's second marriage was stepfather to the girl whom\r\nWilliam Bailey's favourite nephew had recently married, and relations\r\nof this kind, when they occur in the political life of our democracy,\r\nare naturally sacred. For all the shortness of his visit, the Duke of\r\nBattersea had learnt what he wanted to know. He did not depend upon the\r\nPrime Minister's aid. He re-entered his car with an alternative scheme\r\nclear before him, and when he reached home he began to carry it into\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the room where the Philanthropist and Financier\r\nhabitually worked, was a large table which had formerly been the\r\nproperty of the Cardinal de Rohan; it had passed into other hands\r\nduring the misfortunes of the Reinachs[10] some twenty odd years\r\nbefore. Its broad surface supported but a few simple and necessary\r\nthings: two tall Georgian candlesticks of silver plate, now fitted with\r\nelectric lamps; a great ink-pot, and by the side of it an electric bell.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Battersea spread out a large sheet of paper upon the\r\ntable before him, made a few notes, re-arranged certain details, was\r\nsatisfied with his plan, and next, without looking up, stretched\r\nforth his hand to touch the electric bell. He was old and some of his\r\nmovements uncertain. His finger had the misfortune to find not the\r\nelectric bell but the ink-pot, into which it deeply plunged. A lesser\r\nman would have been disturbed at the accident, and a coarser one might\r\nhave been moved to suck the injured limb. The Duke of Battersea showed\r\nno such weakness. He looked up, rubbed his finger on the blotting-pad,\r\nmade sure of the electric bell, and when it was answered, said in a low\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Befan.\"\r\n\r\nThe servant disappeared, and came back in half an hour with the message:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Bevan is not at the Agency, your grace; he is watching the Hampton\r\ndivorce case, your grace. The Agency says, your grace, will you have\r\nPenderton?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not,\" said the Duke of Battersea, still intent upon the\r\npaper before him. \"Find out when he will be back.\"\r\n\r\nIn a quarter of an hour he was told that the detective was expected\r\nhome from Hertfordshire at half-past twelve that night.\r\n\r\nThe duke looked at his watch, compared it with a fine specimen of\r\nToledo clockwork set in a German monstrance upon the mantelpiece, and\r\nsaw that he had an hour to wait. He made a motion with his hand and was\r\nleft alone. He was determined to see Bevan and to see him that night,\r\nbut it was nearly one in the morning before the door opened and the\r\ndetective appeared.\r\n\r\nThe detective was a short gentlemanly man with a hare lip and a\r\nmalformation of the forehead which raised one eyebrow considerably\r\nabove the other. He did not limp, but when he walked the emphasis was\r\nupon the right leg. His ears which were large and prominent did much\r\nto counter-balance the pleasing intelligence of his expression. He\r\nwas not a man whom one would at the first sight, nor at the second,\r\nhave chosen for the unravelling of difficult problems, but the Duke of\r\nBattersea knew far too much of the world to judge by any other standard\r\nthan that of performance and of practice. And Mr. Bevan had not failed\r\nhim on two recent occasions when rapid execution had been essential, as\r\nit was essential now.\r\n\r\nHe wasted no words. He described who had to be watched and what\r\nevidence if possible had to be gathered. He gave the address in Bruton\r\nStreet, and as the detective stood respectfully at the door, he named a\r\nhundred pounds.\r\n\r\n\"It's worth a hundred and fifty, your grace,\" said Mr. Bevan, as he\r\nrepeated the conditions which were laid down to him.\r\n\r\n\"Sefen and sixpence,\" said the Duke with a gentle smile, \"if what I\r\nhave told you already was all indeed\"--and having said that he gave\r\ntime for it to soak in.\r\n\r\nMr. Bevan changed his hat from one hand to the other, then held it in\r\nboth hands and said he was sure he didn't mean to say more than one\r\nshould say, and he would certainly leave it to the Duke, who nodded and\r\nanswered him:\r\n\r\n\"That is good--that is right. For this reason I make it a hundred; and\r\nif he does nothing as you want, you shall see him do, and you shall be\r\na witness.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't make a man do anything worth telling you, my lord,\" said Mr.\r\nBevan rather surlily.\r\n\r\n\"Why, then,\" said the Duke of Battersea, approaching his wrists and\r\nopening his hands widely outwards, \"how can I either pay?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bevan sighed unpleasantly and was content.\r\n\r\nHe left the Presence before two o'clock, but such was his intimacy with\r\nmore than one of the servants that it was half-past two in the morning\r\nbefore he was clear of Barnett House. He did not wait for the tardy\r\nadvent of the winter dawn; he was home before three; he then and there\r\nput on his professional boots, to the soles of which were attached\r\nsmall pads of india-rubber. He secreted upon his person a small\r\nrevolver, a yet smaller electric lantern, £5 in change in case the\r\nhunt should take him far afield, a flask of Scotch whiskey, a box of\r\nfusees, some cigarettes such as are smoked by the landed classes, two\r\ngood cigars, five cheap ones, a little Craven mixture in one side of\r\nhis tobacco pouch and some peculiarly vile shag in the other. He put on\r\na waistcoat within the lining of which his true name and address were\r\ninscribed upon a linen pad, thrust into his breast pocket an envelope\r\nbearing a false name and address, and put into a visiting card case\r\ncertain visiting cards bearing yet a third name and address, that of\r\none Hilling, a commercial traveller in the Seven Sisters Road; others\r\ninscribed Mr. John Hilling, Captain 47th Fusiliers, Rochester, he also\r\nsecreted in various pockets, and a few more in which the same name was\r\nplayed upon in other ways.\r\n\r\nThe reader will be surprised to hear that after these preparations\r\nhe put upon his head a billycock hat of the most demonstrative type,\r\nand committed the imprudence of wearing a large, made-up blue tie.\r\nBut genius, however universal, however disciplined and experienced,\r\nis human. It is easy to criticise a fault in detail; it is more\r\ndifficult to reproduce the general plan of the master; and those who\r\nmay be disposed to ridicule the large made-up tie of Mr. Bevan, or the\r\nbillycock hat which I have gone so far as to call demonstrative, would\r\ndo well to ask themselves whether they would have had the learning or\r\nthe intuition to provide themselves--I mention but one point--with\r\ncigarettes such as are smoked by the landed gentry, with Craven mixture\r\nupon one side of the tobacco pouch and with a peculiarly vile shag upon\r\nthe other; yet Mr. Bevan had thought of these things!\r\n\r\nA few glasses of hot whiskey and water to prepare him for the ordeal\r\nwere rapidly swallowed--for Mr. Bevan, like most men of acute\r\nintelligence, was a moderate drinker--and he went out into the night.\r\nIt was a little after four o'clock.\r\n\r\nA man of less experience in the ways of the world might have neglected\r\nto observe the movements of so wealthy a personage as Mr. Bailey until\r\na later hour in the morning, so universal has the deplorable habit of\r\nlate rising become among the governing classes of this country. Mr.\r\nBevan knew better. He had seen many a dark deed done between five and\r\nseven of a London January morning, nay, in the old days as a member of\r\nthe Force he could well remember routing out the Alsatians close upon\r\nsix o'clock, though to be sure on that occasion the Force had been\r\nguided to those abandoned premises by the sound of boisterous music and\r\nthe firing of a rocket through one of the upper windows.\r\n\r\nIt was not five, then, when Mr. Bevan took his stand opposite the\r\nlittle house in Bruton Street. He had chosen his advantage very well.\r\nWith a courage and skill which only those who have served in the\r\nMetropolitan Police can understand, he hid himself in a corner where\r\na shadow thrown by a buttress put him in complete darkness. He was a\r\nshort man and yet had to crouch a little, but he was used to discomfort\r\nin the prosecution of his duty, and in this attitude, unable even to\r\nsmoke for fear the light should betray him, he watched for over an\r\nhour. At the end of that time rain began to fall. He did not upon\r\nthat account abandon his post; the tardy winter dawn gleamed at last\r\nover the shining roofs of London. With the first hint of daylight the\r\nlight on his collar, which he had neglected to cover, betrayed him to a\r\npoliceman of the name of Tooley, who was slowly pacing the street and\r\nwhistling a mournful air.\r\n\r\nAs quick as lightning Mr. Bevan was grabbed by both elbows, his face\r\nthrust against the rough brick-work, and a natural demand, brief and\r\nperhaps somewhat too violent, as to his occupation and intentions was\r\naddressed to him by that Civil Servant. To the policeman's astonishment\r\nMr. Bevan's only reply to these manœuvres was what is technically\r\nknown in the Force as \"the shake,\" and retreating rapidly three steps\r\nbackward he had the presence of mind to say in a low tone, \"I'll pass\r\nthe order.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words he satisfied his colleague in the manner which is\r\nusual with our efficient and highly trained body of public guardians,\r\nof the nature and legitimacy of his mission. The respective positions\r\nof the Duke of Battersea and of Mr. Bailey were quite enough to\r\nconvince a sober judgment, and policeman Tooley, an active and\r\nintelligent man, at once appreciated the situation, but felt bound in\r\nduty to add:\r\n\r\n\"I must keep my eye on you, mind,\" to which Mr. Bevan cheerfully\r\nreplied by a nod of the head, and resumed his former post.\r\n\r\nAt about half-past seven the rain ceased. Eight o'clock struck: no one\r\nin the street was stirring. A milkman passed down on foot, leaving his\r\nlittle can at every gate, but carefully refraining from uttering that\r\nmusical cry, which the upper classes have, very properly, forbidden in\r\nthe neighbourhood of their town residences. It was a quarter to nine\r\nand the whiskey in Mr. Bevan's stomach had long ago grown cold; nay,\r\nhe felt positively weak for want of breakfast, when the first signs of\r\nlife appeared in Mr. Bailey's house: these took the form, first of a\r\ncat leaping out as though in panic from the area gate, and immediately\r\nafterwards the appearance of a young woman's head utterly incomplete\r\nin toilet, and, in everything save the sex and youth of its owner,\r\nrepulsive. Next, two blinds were drawn up in a bedroom on the second\r\nfloor. The window was thrown open; and for a little while nothing more\r\nof real importance occurred.\r\n\r\nWithin the house, Mr. Bailey's man Zachary had woken his master and had\r\nflooded the room with light.\r\n\r\n\"It is ten o'clock, sir,\" he said in his customary tone of mingled\r\nseverity and deference.\r\n\r\n\"That's a lie,\" said Mr. Bailey, not moving his head from the pillow,\r\nnor withdrawing it by one inch from beneath the bedclothes.\r\n\r\nZachary made no reply. He was accustomed to conversations of this kind.\r\nHe made an unnecessary noise with the hot water, banged the furniture\r\nabout, and then before leaving the room said:\r\n\r\n\"May I go out for the day, sir?\" in a tone rather of menace than of\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\n\"You can go at a quarter past ten--it must be nearly that now,\"\r\nchuckled Mr. Bailey with sleepy humour.\r\n\r\nMr. Bailey's man Zachary was annoyed to have been caught in this trap;\r\nhe consoled himself by remembering that he might leave the house at\r\nonce and his master be none the wiser.\r\n\r\n\"If you're not back by six this evening,\" said Mr. Bailey\r\ngood-naturedly, stretching his arms and yawning, \"you'll be in the\r\nworkhouse in a week or two.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, sir,\" said Zachary in a more respectful tone than he had\r\nyet adopted; he shut the door very softly after him and went tiptoe\r\ndown the deep carpet of the stairs. For the next ten minutes he was\r\ndressing as befitted a man of his temper, and well before ten o'clock\r\nhe had emerged from the front door in a quiet, sensible frock-coat, a\r\ngood but not obtrusive top hat, quite new gloves of a deep brown, and\r\na serviceable but neat umbrella. His boots, however, were laced, not\r\nbuttoned; blacked, not polished.\r\n\r\nMr. Bevan's heart rose with a bound. His long vigil was ended! He\r\npermitted Zachary to turn the corner of Bruton Street into Berkeley\r\nSquare, and then, gauging his pace at much the same as that set by this\r\nexcellent domestic, he followed.\r\n\r\nThe error was not only natural, it was inevitable. It was no case for\r\nhesitation nor even for rapid decision; but even had such a necessity\r\narisen in Mr. Bevan's mind, his habit of prompt decision would have\r\nsaved him from even a moment's delay. He had found his quarry and he\r\nwould hunt it down.\r\n\r\nWith the sober walk that denotes a man of the world, but now and then\r\ntwirling his umbrella as though his birth and status gave him a right\r\nto despise convention, nay, going once or twice so far as to whistle\r\nthe bar of a tune, Zachary proceeded northward to the Tube, and turned\r\ninto that station which takes its name from Bond Street.\r\n\r\nThe Tubes of London have added yet another problem to the already\r\narduous intellectual task of that great army of detectives which stands\r\nbetween Society and Anarchy. To follow a man in the street, to pursue\r\nhis cab or his omnibus at the regulation distance advised by Captain\r\nWattlebury, M. Grignan, and other authorities of European reputation,\r\nis an easy matter; but once let your man get into the train ahead of\r\nyou on the Tube, and you have lost him! The Tube necessitates, as\r\nall my readers who have engaged in detective work will recognise, a\r\nclose proximity to the person watched; but Mr. Bevan was equal to the\r\noccasion. Fully appreciating the strategical advantage of the stairs,\r\nhe was at their foot long before the lift had reached the level of the\r\ntrains, and following Zachary's tall hat through the crush, he sat\r\ndown in the carriage next to that in which the scent lay, gazing into\r\nvacancy and sucking the top of his umbrella. Mr. Bevan watched him\r\nnarrowly through a contrivance with which all the forces of law and\r\norder are familiar: a little book which can be easily held before the\r\nface as though one were reading, but which is pierced by a convenient\r\nhole through which the right eye can sweep the landscape beyond.\r\n\r\nZachary changed for Hampstead, and so did Mr. Bevan. At the junction he\r\nbought a newspaper, the name of which Mr. Bevan, to his great chagrin,\r\nwas unable to note, as he folded it inside-out and read the lower half\r\nof the sheet. At Hampstead, I find it in Mr. Bevan's notes that they\r\nalit, and they reached the happy upper world together. Zachary made\r\nstraight for the Heath. Mr. Bevan, now free to follow him at a discreet\r\ndistance, did so, but grew fainter and weaker as he walked, for he was\r\nin desperate need of food. He hoped and prayed that the chase would\r\nturn into a restaurant: his prayer was answered, though in a manner\r\nshocking to one who still maintained his respect for rank.\r\n\r\nZachary turned into a little public-house of an unpleasing type, nodded\r\ncheerfully to the potman, whom he addressed as \"Larky,\" and ordered--of\r\nall things in the world--gin and water!\r\n\r\nThe accident was a godsend to Mr. Bevan. He noticed that his quarry had\r\nat least had the decency to go into the saloon bar; he dashed into the\r\npublic one, gulped down a glass of beer, bought a handful of biscuits,\r\nwent out immediately lest he should miss the trail, and was glad to see\r\nthat his victim yet lingered within.\r\n\r\nIn twenty minutes or so he came out, his eyes a little watery, and\r\ncontinued his unsuspecting way towards the Heath with the detective\r\nafter him. But he was not alone! By his side there walked, dressed in a\r\nmanner that would have appalled the Press itself, a young woman!\r\n\r\nThe plot thickened. And Mr. Bevan, who had expected a very different\r\noccupation to be provided for him, divined at once the possibilities\r\nwhich his discovery contained. He had no need now to fear hunger,\r\nanxiety, or lack of matter. It was plain sailing for the whole\r\nafternoon. He followed them to the Heath, he saw them seated and\r\nembraced behind a clump of thorn and ready to devour a luncheon they\r\nhad purchased and carried in a paper bag. He would leave them now; he\r\nhad time to return to the little public-house and to inquire of the\r\npotman every detail of the unhappy man's conduct; he was told of his\r\nmonstrous promise to marry the daughter of the potman's master; of\r\nhis repeated and lengthy calls; he learnt at full length the whole\r\ndisgraceful business, and with admirable self-mastery he pretended\r\nto no surprise when he heard that the name the visitor was known to\r\nthe publican and his servant by was \"Zachary Hemmings.\" He waited\r\npatiently until the guilty man reappeared with his paramour in her\r\nfather's home. He waited outside in the advancing dusk until the male\r\noffender had reappeared, somewhat unsteadily, and giving every sign of\r\nan exhilaration due to something more than requited affection. His hat\r\nwas not absolutely straight upon his head; his umbrella trailed upon\r\nthe ground; his face was indolently happy. Zachary did not take the\r\nTube, but as it was now already dark and as he remembered in a fuddled\r\nway that his place was in jeopardy, he had the cunning to hail a lonely\r\ntaximeter which was returning in no good humour after depositing a fare\r\nat the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nThere are in the humbler strata of our national life qualities of\r\ncourage and immediate decision such as produce a Kitchener, a Milner,\r\nor a Macdonald in the higher ranks. A taximeter is the fleetest of all\r\nbeasts: in Hampstead taximeters are rare. Mr. Bevan had decided in a\r\nflash. He dashed up, pulled off his hat, imitating with partial success\r\nthe speech of a man out of breath with running, and told Zachary at\r\ntop speed that if he would permit him to share his taximeter back to\r\ntown he would be saving the life of a young child, of whose sudden\r\naccidental fall he had but just heard by telephone. The domestic,\r\nthough perhaps not naturally warm-hearted, or if warm-hearted, rendered\r\ncallous by years of exacting labour, was, under the combined influences\r\nwhich he had enjoyed, in a softer--nay, in an effusive mood. He seized\r\nMr. Bevan's hands, swung him into the cab, shouted \"Cer'nly!\" and\r\nputting his head out of the window said to the astonished chauffeur,\r\n\"Home!\"\r\n\r\nBefore that mechanician had time to reply in suitable terms, Mr. Bevan\r\nhad whispered through the little hole, \"That's all right, Bond Street:\r\ntell you where to stop,\" and they darted away down the hill.\r\n\r\nZachary tried twice to sing, remembered each time that he was in\r\ncompany, smiled vapidly each time, and each time was silent again. But\r\nI cannot deny that at Chalk Farm, quite forgetting the child whose\r\nunhappy accident was causing an agonised father to be his guest, he\r\ninsisted on getting out and drinking--a course from which that agonised\r\nfather made no attempt to dissuade him; he repeated his folly at the\r\nHorseshoe.\r\n\r\nAt the corner of Bond Street the taximeter pulled up abruptly. Mr.\r\nBevan leaped out, and nodding hurriedly at the astonished Zachary who\r\nhad a vague comprehension that some things were too well known, and\r\nother things too mysterious, he gave the number in Bruton Street to\r\nthe chauffeur and disappeared. The taximeter swept round eight or nine\r\ncorners, waited perhaps a quarter of an hour behind as many blocks in\r\nthe traffic, and finally deposited the unhappy Zachary at his master's\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nThe noise of the engine attracted that master to the ground floor\r\nwindows of his study, and Zachary noted with alarm the vision of his\r\nface. His confused brain prepared a defence. The sum marked upon the\r\ntaximeter was four and tuppence: he feared for one idiotic moment that\r\nit represented 42_s_. Recovering from his alarm he remembered to divide\r\nit by eight, which is the number of pence per mile commonly charged\r\nby these useful vehicles, failed to arrive at a quotient, pressed ten\r\nshillings into the chauffeur's hand, and was only too glad to see him\r\ndepart in the direction of Berkeley Square and of those wealthy regions\r\nto the West. The wretched man was fumbling with his latch-key for the\r\nkeyhole, when he nearly fell forward inwards as the door was suddenly\r\nopened by Mr. Bailey.\r\n\r\nMr. Bailey's face was genial, his eyes bright as ever, his whiskers\r\nas healthy and florid as though he had but just completed his morning\r\ntoilet. With his hands in his pockets he looked down on his abashed\r\nservitor and said pleasantly:\r\n\r\n\"How drunk you are to-night, Zachary!\" He then added as Zachary's hat\r\nfell to the floor: \"I hope that's your hat, Zachary, and not mine!\"\r\n\r\nZachary said \"Yes, sir,\" with painful clarity of intonation.\r\n\r\n\"You come in here, Zachary,\" said Mr. Bailey, opening the door of the\r\nstudy. \"I want to talk to you. Sit down in that chair, a long way from\r\nthe fire.\"\r\n\r\nZachary did as he was bid: Mr. Bailey shut him in, went to the kitchen\r\nstairs and roared down them:\r\n\r\n\"Jane-bring-me-up-a-cup-of-very-hot-coffee-with-no-sugar-in-it-at-once\r\n-I-don't-want-to-be-kept-waiting-in-the-study!\" For such was Mr.\r\nBailey's method of delivering an order in person on the rare occasions\r\nwhen he put himself to that inconvenience. The consequence of that\r\nmethod was that hardly had he joined Zachary in the study when\r\nJane appeared, purple in the face, with a large cup of coffee which\r\ncontained no trace of sugar, and which was extremely hot. The moment\r\nshe was out of the room Mr. Bailey solemnly dropped a pinch of salt\r\ninto the coffee and said to his miserable servant:\r\n\r\n\"Drink that!\"\r\n\r\n\"I do assure you, sir--\" said Zachary in tones of increasing sobriety.\r\n\r\n\"Drink that, you ass,\" said Mr. Bailey, \"do you suppose I don't know\r\nwhat's good for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, certainly sir,\" said Zachary humbly. He gulped the coffee\r\ndown, and when he had done so began: \"It's not near seven, sir.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bailey put up his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Now look here, Zachary,\" he said; \"what I want is information. First\r\nof all, you came in a taxi' cab.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, I did, sir,\" said Zachary. \"I'm sure, sir, I wouldn't\r\nhave----\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't mind your coming home in a pumpkin with six white mice,\" said\r\nMr. Bailey. \"I don't want to know why about anything. What I want is\r\ninformation. Where did you come from?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Ampstead, sir,\" said Zachary, who but rarely dropped his h's, but\r\nthought there were occasions when it was necessary to do so. Then\r\nforgetting his master's injunction, he added: \"But there was a\r\ngentleman, with me, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" said Mr. Bailey, thoroughly interested. \"That's what I\r\nwanted--information. You came in a taximeter (that I could see for\r\nmyself). You came from Hampstead, you came drunk (I'm sure you won't\r\nmind my saying that!) and there was a gentleman with you. Now, who was\r\nthat gentleman?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I don't know,\" said the bewildered Zachary.\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens!\" replied Mr. Bailey. \"Can't you remember where you met\r\nhim?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was coming out of my friend's father's house that is to be,\" said\r\nZachary, with a precision rather of visual concept than of terminology.\r\n\r\n\"The Hop and Garters?\" said Mr. Bailey, with vague reminiscence.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" said Zachary, with as much severity as he had power under\r\nthe conditions to assume. \"The Hop Garden, sir; that's the name of the\r\nhouse, the Hop Garden.\"\r\n\r\n\"How had you passed your time till then?\" asked Mr. Bailey.\r\n\r\nZachary recounted his day in no great detail, and in some fear lest his\r\ndignity should suffer as he told the story.\r\n\r\nMr. Bailey mused. To characters so wayward and loose the solid\r\nplans whereby great men of affairs achieve their ends are at once\r\ninexplicable and tedious. Mr. Bailey had no conception of what was\r\ntoward. He might even have been ready, had Zachary remembered the\r\ncircumstance, to believe the story the detective told about a sick\r\nchild and the necessity for speed. As it was, he was merely bewildered,\r\nand was filled with a sort of instinctive muddled conception that\r\nsomehow or other it had been worth somebody's while to shadow Zachary\r\nas far as the top of Bond Street and no further. But why on earth\r\nshould any one want to shadow Zachary? He thought of burglars, but\r\nburglars do not become intimate with servants by exciting their\r\nsuspicions. He thought of practical jokes; he thought of petty theft,\r\nbut Zachary assured him he was only ten shillings out, and even then\r\nremembered that he had given the ten shillings to the chauffeur.\r\n\r\nWhile he was in this sort of study, making neither head nor tail of the\r\nadventure, Zachary volunteered, a little nervously, for he was afraid\r\nit might sound like an explanation and not like the \"information\" his\r\nmaster was after:\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure he was a gentleman, sir--he knew where you lived.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bailey was quite seriously concerned. To men of his intellectual\r\ncalibre, utterly unworthy to compete with the great directing brains\r\nof our masterful time, and capable only of a superficial and purely\r\nverbal display, a sense of a force which knows _them_ while they do\r\nnot know _it_, is intolerable. Such men are the weak, hunted creatures\r\nof our powerful and creative generation--that is, when the hunt is\r\nworth the hunter's while. And the hunters--the successful hunters--are\r\nthe financiers, the statesmen, the owners, the doers--the Hearsts,\r\nthe Northcliffes, the Clemenceaus, the Roosevelts, the Levi Leiter\r\nJuniors--who make us what we are.\r\n\r\nMr. Bailey, who knew so little of reality, knew this at least, and with\r\nthe instinct of all hunted things, he was troubled. He was much graver\r\nwhen he rose after this conversation and said:\r\n\r\n\"That's all right, Zachary, you'd better go to bed. Don't eat anything,\r\nand drink nothing beyond such cold water as you absolutely require. I'm\r\nsure it will be sufficient.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank you humbly, sir,\" said Zachary. He went out of the room quite\r\nsober--such is the effect of coffee with a little salt--and crept up to\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nMr. Bailey remained for an hour and more gazing at the fire; then he\r\nrang the bell and ordered dinner with the most precise care, choosing\r\njust those articles which could be cooked lightly and quickly,\r\ninsisting to the cook whom he saw in person, that they should follow\r\nin a precise order and at precise intervals of time, and adding, as was\r\nhis invariable custom after each item:\r\n\r\n\"If you haven't got it, send for it.\"\r\n\r\nAt half-past eight this repast was to be ready, and for him alone. He\r\npuzzled at Zachary's mysterious adventure for some moments and longer,\r\ncould make nothing of it, and in order perhaps to relieve his uneasy\r\nsense of incapacity, took refuge in reading one evening newspaper after\r\nanother, and passing upon each some silent, facile, cynical comment as\r\nhe read.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mr. Bevan had reported at Barnett House. He was at once\r\nadmitted.\r\n\r\nHe found the aged statesman and philanthropist before the Adams\r\nchimney-piece, a mass of papers upon a what-not beside him, his\r\ntelephone mobilised upon the great central table, and a pile of\r\nbank-notes standing by the side of it under a paper-weight of bronze\r\nrepresenting the Ariadne of Knidos, a bust the poor Master of Kendale\r\nhad especially admired.\r\n\r\nMr. Bevan stood waiting at the door. The Duke of Battersea with\r\nexquisite good breeding waved his aged hand towards a chair, but Mr.\r\nBevan preferred to remain standing, and he was not pressed. He first\r\nbroke the silence:\r\n\r\n\"I've done the job proper, my lord--your grace, I mean,\" he said;\r\n\"heavy, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"I ask you to tell me quite shortly what you have found,\" said the\r\nDuke, without lifting his eyes.\r\n\r\nIt was almost the same order that Mr. Bailey was giving to his servant\r\nat that same moment some two or three hundred yards away, but what a\r\ngulf between the two men! The strong and secure architect of his own\r\nand of his country's successes, sitting in the splendour of Barnett\r\nHouse, doing, controlling all--and the poor egoist whose feeble\r\ngood-nature or vanity had been the chief feature of the interview in\r\nBruton Street! Mr. Bevan told his story with precision, described\r\nthe well-dressed gentleman leaving the house in Bruton Street; his\r\ndisgraceful adventures in a lower rank; his assumed name of \"Zachary\r\nHemmings.\" The Duke asked the detective whether he were sure Mr. Bailey\r\nused that false name. Mr. Bevan said \"Quite sure, your grace,\" and\r\ncompleted his tale with the story of the drunkenness, the taxi, and all\r\nthe nasty business. When he had done he pulled out the piece of paper\r\nwhich had accompanied him throughout the day and to which he had added\r\na few lines in the Bull and Flummery, on his way from Bond Street to\r\nBarnett House.\r\n\r\n\"I've got it all writ down here, sir--I mean your grace.\" (The Duke\r\nof Battersea made an impatient gesture--he could not bear to have\r\nhis title insisted upon.) \"It's all here,\" repeated Mr. Bevan with\r\nlegitimate pride.\r\n\r\n\"Give it me,\" said the Duke of Battersea quietly.\r\n\r\nMr. Bevan knew the world as well as a man can under his circumstances;\r\nhe also was one of the strong girders of our State, not one of its\r\npainted ornaments; but when two generals meet the greater conquers.\r\nHe handed over the paper quite innocently, and before he knew what\r\nhad happened, the Duke of Battersea had put it in the fire; nay,\r\nwith a vigour rare at his age and rarer still in men of his worldly\r\npossessions, he had thrust it among the coals with the toe of his boot.\r\n\r\nMr. Bevan could not restrain a movement towards it. He was too late to\r\nsave it, then the reserve which the presence of the Great imposes upon\r\nus all recalled him to himself.\r\n\r\nThis brief episode over--and it did not take thirty seconds--the Duke\r\nof Battersea said in a rather louder, more vibrant tone than he had yet\r\nused:\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Bevan, there iss your money\"--he wagged his head towards\r\nthe table. \"You said you would not take it in a cheque; so: but I like\r\nto know where my money goes; and how also.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bevan opened his mouth to speak.\r\n\r\n\"It is take it or leaf it,\" said the Duke of Battersea.\r\n\r\nMr. Bevan took it.\r\n\r\n\"I do think, sir ...\" began Mr. Bevan.\r\n\r\nThere passed suddenly over the Duke of Battersea's face an expression\r\nof such concentration and power as may have passed perhaps over that of\r\nanother great genius[11] when he planned the Parliamentary fortunes of\r\nthe Panama Canal and seemed for a moment thwarted. It was an expression\r\nof enormous intensity, and Mr. Bevan, putting the notes without\r\ncounting them into a side pocket of his coat, and keeping his hand upon\r\nit, quietly left the room.\r\n\r\nWhen he was gone the Duke of Battersea took a note which he had already\r\nwritten and was keeping against this moment, and sent it round the\r\ncorner in a cab to the club where he knew that Fitzgerald was waiting\r\nupon that critical night before going back to the Plâs. The cab came\r\nback immediately with Charles Fitzgerald in it. Here at least was a man\r\nwho understood haste. He was not even wearing a hat!\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Battersea rose to receive him--a rare honour, but he knew\r\nwhen to pay honour. He was affectionate to him, put one hand upon\r\nhis shoulder, and asked him whether he would drink anything, which\r\nFitzgerald very gladly did; and when Fitzgerald had drunk he said:\r\n\r\n\"Do you think you can bring Mr. Bailey at once here? Ah?\"\r\n\r\n\"He'll be dining now,\" said Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\n\"He is dining alone to-night,\" said the Duke of Battersea, \"he is not\r\ndining till half-past eight o'clock. It is twenty minutes only past\r\nseven o'clock.\" He knew these things.\r\n\r\nHe added a number of other details, stuffed with research,\r\nconcentration, and plan, and Fitzgerald admired all he heard.\r\n\r\nFitzgerald waited a moment. \"Mary Smith could get him,\" he said\r\nfinally, thinking as he spoke and holding his head to one side. \"I'll\r\ntelephone to her and she'll telephone to him. Then she'll let me know,\r\nand I'll go and fetch him. I'm sure he'll come.\"\r\n\r\nHe bothered for no formalities but went out at once, for he knew what\r\nwas wanted.\r\n\r\nThe time seemed very long to the Duke of Battersea. The moments were\r\nimportant. Fitzgerald was gone but twenty-five minutes, and when he\r\nreturned the Duke was glad to hear two shambling footsteps accompanying\r\nFitzgerald's own decided step down the marble of the passage.\r\n\r\nAnd sure enough, there came in, half a head above the tall young man,\r\nthe taller, somewhat hesitating figure with its good-natured face,\r\nupon which could now be very palpably read a lack of ease.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Battersea put out his hand, but Mr. Bailey was so awkward\r\nas to be occupied at that moment in blowing his nose. It was but one of\r\nmany indications of the man's inward disturbance. Then he sat down, and\r\nbehind him, without a word of comment or apology, Fitzgerald withdrew\r\nand was off to Mr. Clutterbuck's home.\r\n\r\nWhen they were alone the Duke of Battersea said in a very gentle but\r\nvery decided tone:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Bailey, I think we know each other. I want to tell you a story.\r\nWill you listen out?\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen what?\" said Mr. Bailey, with his irritating verbal quibbles.\r\n\r\n\"Listen out to me,\" said the Duke of Battersea, certain of his idiom.\r\n\r\n\"Would I listen you out?\" said Mr. Bailey.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the Duke of Battersea, still thoroughly master of himself.\r\n\r\n\"Go ahead,\" said Mr. Bailey. He leant back, put his hands into his\r\npockets as though that drawing-room were the most familiar to him\r\nin the world, and surveyed the Duke of Battersea downward through\r\nhalf-shut eyes.\r\n\r\nThe old man began his tale. The wording of it was perfect, and if here\r\nand there a foreign idiom crept into his terse and carefully chosen\r\nphrases, Mr. Bailey would murmur a correction. To such impertinences\r\nthe Duke paid no attention. He told the story of a man who had left\r\nhome that morning; he gave the precise hour at which he left home, the\r\nmanner of his dress, and the very lace upon his boots. He told the\r\nwhole shameful story of the Tube, of the Hop Garden--\r\n\r\n\"Hop and Garters,\" said Mr. Bailey quietly.\r\n\r\n\"So--well then,\" cried the Duke of Battersea, for one moment visibly\r\nangered, \"laugh at last and you laugh best.\" Then he sank back into\r\nhis own sense of power, recovered English idiom and continued. As he\r\nwent on to the story of the Heath, and of the luncheon, Mr. Bailey\r\nrose and began pacing up and down the room. When the Duke came to the\r\nfinal visit to the public-house, to the name \"Zachary Hemming,\" which\r\nhe scanned slowly, hardening the gutturals in \"Zachary\" and filling\r\nthat word with sting, Mr. Bailey sat down again, and before the Duke\r\nhad concluded he had covered his face with his hands. But the old man\r\nwas pitiless. He told the story of the excesses at Chalk Farm, of\r\nfurther excesses at the Horseshoe; he gave the very description of the\r\nmysterious stranger, of the taximeter--of all. Then he ceased.\r\n\r\nThere is always something of the Cad in the Fanatic. A gentleman would\r\nhave warned the aged Philanthropist of the error under which he\r\nlaboured. Not so Mr. Bailey.\r\n\r\nMr. Bailey's face was still hidden. A slight movement of the shoulders\r\ndid not betray his emotion. There was a long interval of silence. Then\r\nthe Duke said:\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Bailey, now who laughs at last?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bailey answered never a word.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Bailey,\" continued the Duke, \"I will do nothing, but so also you\r\nwill nothing. No-thing,\" he added, pronouncing the word quite slowly,\r\n\"no-thing at all.\" He wagged his head gently, and permitted the\r\nslightest of smiles to greet Mr. Bailey's face as it rose from between\r\nhis hands. \"No-thing at all. That is all is there,\" he ended.\r\n\r\nMr. Bailey, with bowed head and with an inaudible sigh repeated, but in\r\na lower tone, stunned as it were into repeating the very phrases and\r\naccent of his host, \"No-thing at all--that is all is there.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he went out without another word.\r\n\r\nIn this way the Duke of Battersea secured himself from danger, and he\r\nslept that night certain that the meeting would not be held. He had won\r\nhis battle.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: I do not allude to M. de Reinach, the great French\r\nstatesman and champion of Truth and Justice, but to his uncle, whose\r\nsudden demise will be familiar to many.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: I refer once more to the (alas!) late Baron de Reinach,\r\nuncle of the great French statesman, Joseph de Reinach.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning Mr. Bailey woke at dawn, a rare thing for him and an\r\nunpleasant one. He did not ring his bell: he hoped perhaps for further\r\nsleep, but he felt wonderfully wakeful. The morning was fresh; he went\r\nand pulled aside the curtain, he threw open the window towards the day,\r\nand sniffed the eager air; his mischievous brain was alert and full of\r\nplans; he was seeking what he might devour.\r\n\r\nIn this mood there suddenly recurred to him the night before, and\r\nthough he was alone he beamed to himself at the recollection of it.\r\nHe first considered, in that minute manner to which such natures are\r\ngiven, how best he could reply, and in a little while he had decided.\r\n\r\nHe dressed and went out, ate his breakfast at a little workmen's\r\nchop-house in one of the back streets--where he was sufficiently stared\r\nat--and then walked smartly northward and eastward towards Mickleton,\r\nmusing as he went, and with every step he took his plan grew more\r\ndefined. Of all the men of Mickleton, Mr. Clay, he found, carried most\r\nweight. His courage in starting business for a third time, his large\r\nnumber of workmen, the rates he paid, his Swedenborgianism, all counted\r\nin the suburb: he had paid Mr. Clay assiduous court for a fortnight,\r\nand Mr. Clay was delighted at the honour.\r\n\r\nIt was half-past nine when he found Mr. Clay in his office, strict and\r\nstarched as ever, and, as ever, in some incomprehensible hurry to get\r\non to the next affair.\r\n\r\n\"Clay,\" he said, \"can you lend me the big shed to-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Clay with the rapidity of decision that had already\r\nlost him one fortune and grievously jeopardised two others. \"James,\" he\r\nsaid, turning round smartly, \"book that. Mr. Bailey takes the big shed\r\nwhen the men knock off work.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\" broke in William Bailey, \"not when the men knock off work.\r\nIt's Saturday man! Half-past eight's the hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said Mr. Clay promptly. \"James, book that: not when the men knock\r\noff work, half-past eight. Anything more?\" he added, turning to Mr.\r\nBailey as upon a swivel.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Clay, certainly,\" said Mr. Bailey with deliberate hesitation.\r\n\"Will the men come?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course they'll come. I'll tell them to come: they'll come anyhow.\r\nJames,\" he said, turning round again, \"note that the men are to come.\"\r\n\r\nThe wretched James noted it.\r\n\r\n\"Anything more?\" said Mr. Clay.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Bailey, \"will you take the chair?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said Mr. Clay. \"James, remind me that I take the chair.\"\r\n\r\n\"How shall I remind you?\" replied the terrified boy.\r\n\r\n\"How shall you remind me, you fool? Write it down--book it--make a note\r\nof it. Anything more?\" he continued.\r\n\r\n\"No, I think that's about all,\" said Mr. Bailey. But as he turned to\r\ngo slowly out Mr. Clay's curiosity got the better of his extremely\r\nbusinesslike habits.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Bailey,\" he said, coughing slightly, \"Bailey, I beg your pardon,\r\nbut what will the meeting be about?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what on earth does that matter?\" said Mr. Bailey good-naturedly.\r\n\"Just a meeting.\"\r\n\r\n\"About the unseating of our member?\" asked Mr. Clay anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Mr. Bailey with jollity, \"all sorts of things of that\r\nsort.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm your man,\" said Mr. Clay, \"I'm your man. None of that about here:\r\nwe're free born in Mickleton, we are. Mickleton men,\" he added,\r\nas though Mickleton were an island that had fiercely defended its\r\nindependence in long and bloody wars--\"Mickleton men, Mr. Bailey.\" Then\r\nhe nodded, and remembering the true secret of success, began writing\r\nrapidly again.\r\n\r\nMr. Bailey sauntered out. He looked about him to find his direction,\r\nturned down Mafeking Avenue, and when towards ten o'clock he had\r\nreached the agents for the Second Jubilee Hall and the Coronation\r\nAnnexe, his foolish and disastrous intention was fixed.\r\n\r\nHe entered abruptly into his business and told the clerk that he must\r\ncountermand the use of the building for that night. He was willing to\r\npay the £40 for it as though he had hired it, and in case they could\r\nget another let at so short a notice, half that sum.\r\n\r\nThe clerk had been warned by his principal that Mr. Bailey would\r\nprobably telephone or still more likely call in person that morning,\r\nand professed a need to consult the head of the firm before he could\r\ngive a reply. He was careful to leave Mr. Bailey with a copy of the\r\n_Times_ while he went into the principal's private room, and Mr.\r\nBailey, who had not seen that paper for some months, gloomily read a\r\nleader upon foreign affairs, in which his warped judgment pretended to\r\ndetect the hand of the redoubtable and ubiquitous Abraham. He had not\r\nbeen engaged in this fashion for five minutes, when the clerk returned\r\nand told him in a firm voice they could not accept his offer.\r\n\r\n\"How do you mean you can't accept it?\" demanded Mr. Bailey in very\r\ngenuine astonishment and with still more genuine irritation. \"You can't\r\nrefuse it!... you mean you can't accept the £20?\" he added a little\r\nmore gently.\r\n\r\n\"Yes we can, sir--no I don't, sir,\" answered the clerk hurriedly and\r\nfirmly, while his mouth twitched like that of a Colonial Governor in\r\ntime of crisis. \"I mean we can't accept it, sir, it can't be done.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it's got to be done,\" roared Mr. Bailey. \"You can't force me to\r\nhold my meeting if I don't want to!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, certainly not, sir,\" said the clerk.\r\n\r\n\"Then what the hell do you mean?\" shouted the blasphemous fellow.\r\n\r\n\"I mean that we can't take a plain inclusive payment for the loss and\r\ndisturbance, sir. We can't do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What _do_ you mean?\" said Mr. Bailey.\r\n\r\nThe clerk answered that he must consult his principal again, and Mr.\r\nBailey, restraining himself with a considerable effort, sat down to\r\nfinish the leader which he was more convinced than ever had proceeded\r\nfrom the pen of the mythical Hebrew. It was a long while before the\r\nclerk returned, for it had been necessary to communicate by telephone\r\nwith the Duke of Battersea, and at such an early hour it was not easy\r\nto obtain the philanthropist's reply.\r\n\r\n\"We'll take your offer, sir,\" said the clerk.\r\n\r\n\"Oh you will, will you?\" said Mr. Bailey, \"then you won't have the\r\nchance. I'll hold the meeting just the same. So there!\" he added, a\r\nlittle vulgarly, and stalked out.\r\n\r\nIt is undecided, flighty action of this sort which leads to half the\r\ntrouble in this world. Mr. Bailey had not the remotest intention of\r\nholding the meeting in the original hall. In that his somewhat wayward\r\ndecision stood firm. With that object he had seen Mr. Clay; and he\r\nwas wise, for the forces against him were too strong to permit him to\r\ncall the meeting in the Second Jubilee Hall or even in the Coronation\r\nAnnexe; they were strong enough to prevent his holding it in any public\r\nbuilding. But this sudden rise of temper on his part proved a source of\r\nconsiderable irritation and expense to others, who should not have been\r\nmade responsible for it.\r\n\r\nThe conversation that passed over the telephone, between the Duke of\r\nBattersea and the agent, was singularly and needlessly acrimonious\r\nupon the part of the aged statesman, almost servile upon the part\r\nof the agent; both emotions might surely have been spared to two men\r\nwho at heart knew themselves to be worthy of nobler things, had not\r\nMr. Bailey, by his precipitate ill-temper, destroyed arrangements\r\nwhich would probably have been for his own good, and certainly for\r\nthat of the community at large. The upshot of the conversation was\r\nthat the Duke, despairing of understanding the situation, announced\r\nhis intention of coming himself to Mickleton by noon, and the agent,\r\npleased as he was at the advertisement that such a visit must afford\r\nhim, would willingly have foregone the honour for the sake of that\r\npeace which he feared never to regain.\r\n\r\nAt noon the motor-car glode up with its tiny strawberry leaf coronet\r\nand the dainty arms upon the panels.\r\n\r\nThe agent came out, was obsequious, deferential, intelligent and full\r\nof sympathy, but unfortunately incapable of the rapid perception\r\nwhich was demanded of him. His only reply was that he could not see\r\nhow he could do it; that he would do everything he could; he would be\r\ndelighted to withdraw the placards which were even now being got ready\r\nto stand outside the hall; he would make what difficulties he could for\r\nthe admission of the Press--though he very much doubted his power to\r\nexclude reporters once the hall was hired. When, in the midst of his\r\nexcuses, he suddenly let light into his caller's mind by saying:\r\n\r\n\"And of course everything would be subject to the proprietors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are then the proprietors?\" said the Duke sharply.\r\n\r\n\"The Anglo-Saxon Exchange,\" said the agent with that touch of pride\r\nwhich we all feel when we mention any important power with which we\r\nhave even a distant connection.\r\n\r\nThe Duke was relieved.\r\n\r\n\"That I should also have known,\" he said gently, and then changing his\r\nmanner altogether he added:\r\n\r\n\"That is _allright_, that is _allright_,\" separating the first two\r\nwords and laying stress upon the first syllable of the last, in a\r\nmanner which still faintly betrayed those difficulties with the English\r\nlanguage which he had had the courage and the perseverance to conquer\r\nalmost completely.\r\n\r\nHe went away in a frame of mind at which the agent was at once too\r\npolite and too humble to wonder, but which was certainly far less\r\nagitated than that in which he had come. It was a heavy strain to\r\nfall upon a man of the Duke of Battersea's age, and one that should\r\nhave been spared him, but no one knew better than that strong genius\r\nof finance what things may be done by deputy and what things must be\r\ndone in person. Nor will any of my readers regret that the old man's\r\ninvestigation should have left him freed of the fears which the vicious\r\nand unpatriotic conduct of an irresponsible eccentric had aroused.\r\n\r\nA little after lunch Mr. Kahn, the secretary of the Anglo Saxon\r\nExchange, happened to drop in at the agent's in Mickleton. There was\r\nnothing unexpected in the visit. His few questions turned upon the\r\nusual topics, whether the hall had recently let well, who had taken\r\nit, whether the more disturbed political meetings had done any damage,\r\nwhether it was now worth applying for a licence, &c. It occurred to\r\nhim to ask, just as he was going away, when the hall was likely to be\r\nlet next, and to whom, as there were certain reparations which the\r\narchitect for the estate had decided upon.\r\n\r\nThe reappearance of this terrible subject once more disturbed the\r\nrestored equanimity of the agent.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear,\" he said, \"it's let--in a manner of speaking.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's in a manner of speaking?\" said the astonished secretary.\r\n\r\n\"Well, a gentleman's got it anyhow, and then he didn't want it, and now\r\nhe wants it again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh nonsense!\" said Mr. Kahn, \"we can't play the fool with the County\r\nCouncil. The platform's declared unsafe; we must have the workmen come\r\nin. I thought there were several days to do it in and I wasn't in any\r\nhurry, but it certainly can't be done in a couple of hours. You'll have\r\nto tell your man he can't have it.\"\r\n\r\nThe appearance of this further complication almost drove the wretched\r\nagent mad. Excusing himself for perhaps the fifth time that day and\r\nrushing to the telephone he called up Mr. Bailey and entreated him to\r\ncancel the engagement. But Mr. Bailey was in a dour mood, and as he sat\r\nindulging in his habitual excess of port after a solitary lunch, he\r\ndarted into his receiver the most positive and vicious refusal, saying\r\nplainly that if his rights were tampered with he would sue for damages.\r\n\r\nThe agent came back with the substance, though not with the expletives\r\nof this reply, and the secretary of the Anglo-Saxon Exchange, pulling\r\nout his watch, said briefly:\r\n\r\n\"Well, there's no help for it. We must send in the workmen at once, and\r\nif he wants to sue he can sue.\"\r\n\r\nIn an hour a considerable body of healthy but somnolent men slouched\r\ninto the building, their chief showed his written orders, and the\r\nremainder of the afternoon was spent in removing benches, opening\r\nup the floor, barricading the door, cutting off the electric\r\nlight from the main (nothing is more dangerous than to leave such\r\nconnections during repairs), digging a deep trench in front of the\r\nback entrance, and in other ways setting about improvements that were\r\ndoubtless necessary, but that would make it highly inconvenient for\r\nany considerable body to gather within for political or for any other\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThe agent, after repeated conversations with Mr. Bailey, each more\r\nconciliatory than the last, promised and despatched a cheque for £25 on\r\nthe distinct understanding that no proceedings should follow; and when\r\nthe agent had recovered this sum (as he did with difficulty) from the\r\nAnglo-Saxon Exchange, the expenses of that great financial corporation,\r\nin labour and in compensation, were, I regret to say, considerably over\r\n£100.\r\n\r\nMr. Bailey, seated by his lonely but warm and brilliant hearth, held\r\nthe cheque for £25 daintily between his finger and thumb. For a moment\r\nit seemed as though he would have put it in the fire, then with the\r\nsubtle smile of the fanatic, he thought better of the business; he\r\nendorsed the cheque and sent it, with a Latin motto pinned on, to\r\na Jew-baiting organisation in Vienna; a foul gang of which he knew\r\nnothing whatsoever save that he had read its address in one of those\r\nvile Continental rags from which he derived so many of his prejudices,\r\nand whose authority was the origin of his repeated falsehoods.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt had been arranged that Mr. Clutterbuck should pick up Mr. Bailey on\r\nthe way, just upon eight o'clock, and drive him to the hall.\r\n\r\nHe had been late so often that Mr. Bailey was expecting some delay,\r\nbut when the quarter had struck, he grew anxious; and at twenty past\r\nhe would wait no longer. He had the good luck to get a taxi at the\r\ncorner of the square, but even so he would be late. He began to have\r\ndoubts, and as he dashed up northwards to Mickleton those doubts in\r\nthat diseased brain of his rapidly became certainties. Mr. Clutterbuck\r\nhad been nobbled: Mr. Clutterbuck would not appear. Asleep or ill, or\r\noverturned in some ditch, or accidentally locked up in some room, the\r\nex-Member for Mickleton would not be in Mickleton that night. Such were\r\nthe wild fancies which formed in the fanatic's imagination. The truth\r\nwas simple and needed no such extravaganza of melodrama as William\r\nBailey concocted within himself.\r\n\r\nCharlie Fitzgerald had had the curiosity to stroll into the old\r\nconstituency that morning; he had come back to the centre of town\r\nfrom Mickleton by two. He had had lunch, of course, with the Duke\r\nof Battersea, who depended every day more and more upon the young\r\nfellow's conversation and wit. Mr. Bailey's latest insanity, which\r\nCharlie Fitzgerald happened to have heard of during his visit to\r\nMickleton in the morning, was naturally touched upon in their\r\nconversation; they laughed at the cunning which had hired Mr. Clay's\r\nshed, and they discussed the chances of the extempore meeting, but the\r\nhappy young Irishman was not without a sense of duty; he would not\r\nleave his employer unaided, nor did the Duke of Battersea press him too\r\neagerly to remain.\r\n\r\nBy half-past four, therefore, he was back at The Plâs, ready with his\r\ncheery voice to give Mr. Clutterbuck energy for the evening's business.\r\nHe suggested a run round in one of the motors before going straight\r\ninto town; there was a fine heartening wind from the south-west, with\r\nheavy clouds; it was just the afternoon to take an hour or two of the\r\nair before turning in after dark to London and duty. The suggestion was\r\nexcellent, as were most of Charlie's suggestions, and Mr. Clutterbuck,\r\ncarefully rolling up the speech that Mr. Bailey had written for him,\r\nand thrusting it into his breast pocket, put on his great fur coat and\r\ngloves, and ordered one of the smaller cars to come round.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing braces one up like a sharp bit of motoring before a speech,\"\r\nsaid Mr. Clutterbuck, as he got into the open Renault.\r\n\r\nCharlie Fitzgerald was occupied in hauling away at the barrel organ in\r\nfront of the radiator. He made faces as he did so.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck was rubbing his hands nervously and glancing at the sky.\r\n\r\n\"It looks dark,\" he went on, still rubbing his hands, \"but I dare say\r\nnothing will come of it.\"\r\n\r\nCharlie Fitzgerald, with a face more hideous than any yet drawn, gave\r\na final tug at the starting handle and the machine began to throb.\r\nHe jumped up by Mr. Clutterbuck's side and steered slowly past the\r\nlodge into the Croydon Road, while Mr. Clutterbuck kept on harping at\r\nhis side upon the advantages of a sharp spin before a speech, and the\r\ndoubtfulness of the weather. They fell into the main road and turned\r\nsharply to the left.\r\n\r\n\"Taking us far afield?\" said Mr. Clutterbuck cheerfully. Nothing\r\npleased him more than the experience of his secretary in the driving of\r\na car. \"Godalming, eh?\"\r\n\r\nCharlie Fitzgerald spoke for the first time:\r\n\r\n\"Something of that kind,\" he said. \"Just a long run.... We'll go\r\nfurther than Godalming; we'll go right away round, and come into town\r\nfrom the north and west by the Harrow Road. It's much better like that;\r\nwe won't get any of the slums. Let's eat somewhere in the country.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck was delighted. His honest old soul and his still more\r\nhonest old stomach could not quite forget the honest old hours of high\r\nteas and a snack later on.\r\n\r\nThey shot round the base of the hills, missed a child in Dorking, ran\r\ninto Guildford, had a splendid zizz along the Hog's Back, and then\r\nturned sharp round on to the Frimley Road, passed Penny Hill, and on\r\ntowards Virginia Water. By the time they reached Staines it was dark.\r\n\r\nAll the way Mr. Clutterbuck had spoken with increasing joy, and Charlie\r\nFitzgerald, in spite of his interest in the driving, had been very\r\nhuman to him. Now the dark had fallen, however, it was necessary that\r\nhe should keep silence while he picked his way across country towards\r\nHarrow.\r\n\r\nThe turnings were bewildering, but Mr. Clutterbuck very properly\r\ntrusted to his guide, and when about half-past six he had not yet\r\nperceived the first gas lights of a London street, he only asked quite\r\ncasually whereabouts they were.\r\n\r\nCharlie Fitzgerald answered with perfect straightforwardness that they\r\nmust be somewhere near North Holty and Pinner by the look of the lanes,\r\nand he would take the next turning to the right; it would put them into\r\nBruton well before eight, but they would have no time for more than a\r\nsnack on the way. The next turning to the right he duly took and then\r\nfor many miles the road appeared to lead through a maze of turnings\r\nuntil they found themselves steadily ascending. On the right and the\r\nleft were silent woods of beech, and there was no light for miles\r\naround. It was long past 7 o'clock, and Mr. Clutterbuck was seriously\r\nalarmed.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, Mr. Fitzgerald,\" he said--it was not often that he\r\nhad remonstrated in all these months--\"I beg your pardon, but are you\r\nquite certain where you are?\"\r\n\r\nThen for the first time Charlie Fitzgerald confessed that he was\r\nnot absolutely certain; he could not possibly, he said, be far from\r\nRickmansworth, even if he had gone quite out of his way, and the best\r\nthing they could do was to send a telegram from the next telegraph\r\noffice and to ask their way.\r\n\r\nAs he thus spoke, he suddenly slackened speed at a turn in the road and\r\nbegan a steep descent which lasted for over a mile. One five minutes\r\nand another went by; there was no sign of a house. At last a light\r\nshowed far off to the left of the road.\r\n\r\nFitzgerald pulled up, leapt out with zeal, and came back with the\r\ninformation that they were at Postcombe, and so far as he could make\r\nout from the rustics who were singularly dull, the next post office\r\nwas a mile or two down the road; they were on the right line for\r\nLondon, but it would be another eighteen miles.\r\n\r\nThe post office was there right enough, and Fitzgerald went in and sent\r\na telegram; then he took his seat again and drove through the night.\r\n\r\nMile after mile went by and there was no sign of men.\r\n\r\nAt Mr. Clutterbuck's age this kind of thing is dangerous; the lack of\r\nfood told upon him; the anxiety told upon him still more. He worried\r\nFitzgerald with continual questions; when they would be in; what\r\ndirection they were following; whether he could perceive any glimmer of\r\nLondon before them.\r\n\r\nTo these questions his secretary only replied by nervous jerks of the\r\nhead as he drove on straight through the darkness. His anxiety was\r\nbetrayed by the forward bend of his body and the anxious tightening of\r\nhis brows. He had hoped, perhaps, before he had sent the telegram to be\r\nin time. That was now past praying for, but they might at least turn\r\nthe confusion of the meeting into a success if only they could make the\r\nlights of London by nine. He pushed the car to its utmost limits of\r\nspeed, careless of the thick blackness and of the perpetual windings of\r\nthe lanes which he followed with singular confidence.\r\n\r\nThey passed over a railway line, but there was no station in sight;\r\nthey went on and passed another in the same fashion, then a broad river.\r\n\r\nAt last the motion showed them they were taking yet another long hill.\r\nThere was no hedge upon either side, open fields, down; and a bitter\r\nwind driving across them filled the night. It was even too dark to\r\nperceive more than the ghosts of the clouds, when, at what seemed the\r\nloneliest part of this lonely countryside the machine stopped suddenly,\r\nand Charlie Fitzgerald, in a voice of weary despair, muttered half to\r\nhimself and half to his companion:\r\n\r\n\"If it's the king-bolt, we're done!\"\r\n\r\nHe took one of the lanterns from the front of the car, put it down upon\r\nthe ground where it would illumine the complicated works beneath, and\r\nlying flat upon his back on the road, he began to inspect the damage.\r\nMr. Clutterbuck, stooping anxiously with hands on knees, interrogated\r\nhim from time to time, but received only disjointed replies in which\r\nking-bolts, the differential, the clutch and Beeton's Patent played a\r\nconfused part.\r\n\r\nAfter some few minutes of this investigation Charlie Fitzgerald\r\nreappeared, replaced the lamp, and said in a solemn manner:\r\n\r\n\"We're cooked!\"\r\n\r\nIt began to snow.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Clutterbuck had had the slightest idea where he was, his dolour\r\nmight have been to that amount relieved. He had none. He looked at his\r\nwatch by the acetylene flare and found that it was nearly ten o'clock.\r\nThe monotony of their misfortune was relieved by the approach of a\r\nhorse and cart, and they learned from the driver at last the full\r\nextent of their misfortune. They had the choice, it seemed, of two\r\nresting-places that night, equally distant, one was Stow-in-the-Wold;\r\nand the only consolation the situation could offer them was the\r\ncertainty that their car had done very well to cover such a distance in\r\nsuch weather in such a time. For the rest, eight miles in the dark was\r\nnot a pleasing prospect, and Charlie Fitzgerald was moved to make one\r\nmore attempt at reviving the car.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Clutterbuck's astonishment the able young fellow succeeded\r\nthis time within a very few moments. They continued the main road and\r\nreached their inn a little before eleven.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile in London the meeting had, indeed, pursued a course Mr.\r\nClutterbuck did not in the least desire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nNext to Mr. Clay's great shed there was an office which during the\r\ndaytime served for the time checker. It was used that night as the\r\nante-room to the meeting.\r\n\r\nSmall as it was, some twenty or thirty of the greater people of\r\nMickleton had crowded into it, and more were coming of those who were\r\nto occupy the platform upon this decisive night. But though the hour\r\nof half-past eight approached, struck, and went past, Mr. Clay was\r\nincreasingly anxious to observe that no Mr. Clutterbuck was there. With\r\nthis exception, all the arrangements he was sure had been businesslike,\r\npractical, and thorough, but he could not conceal it from himself that\r\nno amount of organising power could make up for the absence of the\r\nex-Member, whom the vast crowd had come to hear; and in his heart he\r\nlaid that absence down to the irresponsibility and wayward temperament\r\nof William Bailey; he noticed also the absence of Mr. Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\nIn the great shed next door the audience were beginning to stamp\r\ntheir feet, and there were sounds as though their impatience might be\r\ndangerous, but Mr. Clay dared not proceed.\r\n\r\nJust at the moment when his own patience was breaking, and when he\r\nhad determined to take the platform at any risk and to carry off\r\nthe meeting as best he could, Mr. William Bailey swished up in his\r\ntaximeter, stepped out of it with perfect and exasperating coolness,\r\nelbowed his way through the little crowd to Mr. Clay and said:\r\n\r\n\"Well, Clay, he hasn't turned up, and I don't think he will.\"\r\n\r\nLet those who have the power to construct new words discover one to\r\ndescribe Mr. Clay's interior emotions at the news. The words he used\r\nwere these:\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand. Why not? Whose fault is that? Something must be\r\ndone! You can't do that sort of thing. I do wish it hadn't happened.\r\nI'm not a rich man, but I'd give £5! We ought to wait! I really can't\r\nconceive--I do wish!\" and one or two other pronouncements of the same\r\nsort which betrayed not only in their phraseology but in their tone, an\r\nalarming perturbation. His face wore a look of intense suffering, and\r\nhe was in no way calmed by the intermittent roars proceeding from an\r\naudience which had now waited over half an hour, and in many of whom\r\nenthusiasm was already fermenting into anger.\r\n\r\nThe larger body of influential people who were to have supported the\r\nex-Member for Mickleton upon the platform were to the full as anxious\r\nas their Chairman. Only Mr. Bailey appeared to regard the accident with\r\ncomplete calm. He answered the agitated Clay by suggesting a short\r\nexcursion on to the platform and an explanation to the audience that\r\ntheir hero had been kidnapped.\r\n\r\nMr. Clay's voice rose as high as a woman's:\r\n\r\n\"_He's been kidnapped!_\" he screamed.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, no,\" said Mr. Bailey, \"I didn't say he'd been kidnapped. I\r\nsaid 'let's go and tell the audience he's been kidnapped!' I don't know\r\nwhat's happened to him, and neither do you nor anybody else. Perhaps\r\nhe's dead; perhaps his motor's broken down. Perhaps he made a mistake\r\nabout the hour. Perhaps he's gone mad. It's no good speculating; the\r\npoint is to prevent a riot.\"\r\n\r\nAs he said this the noise within the hall grew so like that of a herd\r\nof wild bulls that Mr. Clay was spurred to yet further activity.\r\n\r\n\"But you can't go and tell them an untruth,\" he said, almost crying as\r\nhe said it. \"... Oh, let's go in and hold the meeting,\" he added, and\r\nthen concluded with the apparently irrelevant words: \"I'm a business\r\nman and I like business ways.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bailey acceded as he would have acceded to any other misfortune,\r\nand the whole troop of them came tramping in, following Mr. Clay up the\r\nrough, improvised steps on to the platform.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of these notables solemnly filing in and taking their\r\nchairs soothed for a moment the angry mass below, but they looked in\r\nthe procession for the dome-like forehead and the crescent moustache\r\nof a Clutterbuck: neither were there. Mr. Bailey watched the seething\r\naudience kindly through his spectacles, and marvelled at the numbers\r\nwho had come.\r\n\r\nThere must have been over five thousand men present; the furthest\r\nrecesses of the great shed were crowded with lads and young labourers\r\nstanding upon the benches the better to follow the speeches, and packed\r\nas close as herrings, and a big mob outside was even now struggling at\r\nthe doors. It was fearfully hot and close, and at the back a woman had\r\nfainted. He feared for the result.\r\n\r\nMr. Clay whispered to him hurriedly, but Mr. Bailey was observed to\r\nshake his head. Then Mr. Clay was seen to turn to Mr. Alderman Thorne\r\nand urge--perhaps implore--his aid: that gentleman ponderously rose to\r\nspeak. His voice was deep and resonant: his gestures large. He reminded\r\nhis hearers of many things: that English freedom was at stake, that\r\ntheir ancestors had torn up the railings in Hyde Park, and that the\r\nspirit of Cromwell still lived. Then next, as he had been hurriedly\r\nadvised, he suggested that they should sing that great new song and\r\nhymn which expressed their determination and their hopes.\r\n\r\nAs yet no one moved. He recited the first verse and begged them with\r\nreligious enthusiasm to sing it when he had completed the opening words:\r\n\r\n \"_The Lion, the Lion, his teeth are prepared,\r\n He has blown the loud bugle, his sabre is bared._\"\r\n\r\nKipling's magnificent words brought a dozen to their feet; a few more\r\nwere thinking of rising; a woman's voice had already begun, somewhat\r\nprematurely, \"_The Lion_ ...\" in a high treble, when a large, bearded\r\nman, with a fearless face and an appearance of fixed determination\r\nsprang up in the body of the meeting and said with a rich North country\r\nburr:\r\n\r\n\"Mrrr. Chairrman.\"\r\n\r\nThe others looked about them and sat down. The woman's treble piped\r\naway into nothing, and the North Countryman, still standing huge, said\r\nagain much more loudly:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Chairman!\"\r\n\r\nThis simple remark elicited on every side large shouts of \"You're\r\nquoite roight! Don't give wye,\" and other encouraging expressions.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Chairman,\" said the stranger for the third time, when their cries\r\nsubsided, \"before we hear this gentleman or sing yonder, perr-haps\r\nyou'll tell us why ourr Memberr is not heerr?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clay, who was smiling pleasantly during this episode, and moving\r\nhis feet with great rapidity to and fro under the table to relieve the\r\ntension of his nerves, was about to reply when the stranger, as is the\r\ncustom of plain straightforward men in the poorer ranks of society,\r\nproceeded to speak at some length in support of his query; and Mr. Clay\r\nwas too much pleased with such a respite to call him to order. The\r\nhonest fellow pointed out, under various heads, not without rhetorical\r\nembellishments, and with considerable movement of the right arm, what\r\nthe constituency had a right to expect, what was and what was not an\r\ninsult to working men, and continually measured the circumstances of\r\nthe evening by the fixed standards of what one gentleman has a right to\r\nexpect from another. He was repeatedly cheered, and his Christian name,\r\nembellished with endearing epithets, was called out more than once in\r\nlively accents.\r\n\r\nWhen he had sat down, and before Mr. Clay, who was half on his feet,\r\ncould reply, another and totally different being in quite another\r\nquarter of the room, rose to make what he affirmed was a very different\r\nprotest, but one which, in the course of his making it, turned out to\r\nbe nearly identical with the first which had been heard.\r\n\r\nThen at last Mr. Clay had his chance and was free to observe, to loud\r\ncries of \"Speak up!\" and other less complimentary commands, that the\r\noccasion was one in which a little patience----\r\n\r\nIt was at this precise moment that an orange, fired with incredible\r\nrapidity, whizzed past the speaker's head and broke with considerable\r\nforce upon the mantled shoulder of Mrs. Battersby.\r\n\r\n\"If that was one of my men----\" shouted Mr. Clay--but he got no\r\nfarther. To the protests which were now rising from the greater part\r\nof the audience, were added inconsequent songs raised by mere rowdies,\r\nand to add to the confusion a free fight began in the south-eastern\r\ncorner of the room between two gentlemen who were of the same opinion,\r\nbut of whom each had completely misunderstood the attitude of the other\r\nupon the subject to which the evening was to have been devoted. The\r\ndiversion afforded by this conflict attracted a larger and a larger\r\nnumber of champions upon both sides, and suddenly, for no apparent\r\nreason and prompted only by that brutish instinct which will often\r\nseize upon a mob when it gets out of hand, a considerable body of the\r\nelectors present broke and surged towards the Platform.\r\n\r\nThe Platform in its turn attempted to go out, but the single door\r\nof issue so considerably impeded their determined efforts that their\r\nrear, if I may so express myself, was hopelessly outflanked by their\r\nassailants long before the communications of the retreat had been\r\nproperly organised. It cannot be denied that Mr. Alderman Thorne made\r\na good fight of it for a man of his age and dimensions, and at the\r\nvery moment when Mrs. Battersby, emitting piercing shrieks, was being\r\nsqueezed sideways through the door, he was observed planting his fist\r\nwith some vigour into the face of one of his own colleagues whom he had\r\nmistaken for the enemy.\r\n\r\nMr. Clay, who was quite unused to other combat than that of religious\r\ndebate, improvised a defence with a chair, the legs of which he pushed\r\nback and forth rapidly with such considerable effect as to permit him\r\nto abandon his post almost the last and without a wound.\r\n\r\nAs for Mr. Bailey, he took refuge in his mere height; he retreated\r\nsomewhat to the back of the platform, stood up, surveyed the swaying\r\ntangle of struggling men. He was pleased to note that the sound\r\ntradition which forbids men of inferior reach and weight to engage in\r\ncoarse physical contest, spared him the active exertions necessary\r\nto so many of his friends. When he saw, or thought he saw, that the\r\nlast of these as they backed towards the door were in danger of\r\nill-treatment, he elbowed his way without much resistance in their\r\ndirection, and with some good humour pushed aside the first rank of\r\ntheir assailants.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the platform was completely covered with the victorious band\r\nwho had stormed it; the moment was propitious for the entry of the\r\npolice, who had been telephoned for from the ante-room; ten of these\r\nstalwart fellows marched in with military precision, and by their\r\nvigorous efforts prevented any further ingress to the platform which\r\nthey erroneously supposed they had come in time to defend.\r\n\r\nMr. Bailey, shuffling out into the street in the midst of his still\r\nheated neighbours, thought it would be entertaining to approach the\r\nmain door and to hear the opinion of the electorate. He was not\r\ndisappointed. When the last of them had come out and when he had\r\nmanaged to explain himself to the police, who were all for making\r\nhim their unique prisoner, he walked slowly homewards, meditating\r\nupon the forces of the modern world and imagining doubtless a hundred\r\nhare-brained theories to account for the very simple accident which\r\nhad befallen the unfortunate Clutterbuck. To his diseased mind there\r\nseemed no third explanation beyond kidnapping and blackmail; and when\r\nhe considered the shortness of the time available for the discovery\r\nof Mr. Clutterbuck's foibles, his futile judgment had determined _à\r\npriori_ and without a shadow of proof, that as Mr. Clutterbuck could\r\nnot have been blackmailed, Mr. Clutterbuck had been spirited away.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNext morning, between eleven and twelve, William Bailey lay in bed\r\namusing himself by reading for once a whole batch of Sunday papers, for\r\nall of which he had just despatched Zachary to a large agent.\r\n\r\nThe ridiculous fellow was drawing up a memorandum, annotated with\r\nqueries and remarks of the most fantastic kind, upon the names of\r\nthe proprietors, the careers of the editors and the reasons each\r\nmight have for giving his particular version of the affair. He noted\r\nwhat percentage mentioned the meeting at all; the adjectives used\r\nwith regard to each: the motives ascribed to its promoters and to\r\nthe indignation of the audience. The fact that the _Observer_ had no\r\nspace to mention the ridiculous bagarre he put down, as my readers may\r\nwell imagine, to some dark and mysterious conspiracy connected with\r\nthe Hebrew people. The fact that of those who mentioned it only two\r\nalluded vaguely to the Ruby Mines and none to the Duke of Battersea he\r\nascribed, of course, not to the very natural reason that these details\r\ncould not concern the general public, but to what he was pleased to\r\nterm \"corruption.\" And altogether his disappointment at the result\r\nof the evening before, though it was a result which he had more than\r\nhalf expected, was amply made up for by his perverted pleasure in the\r\ncontemplation of that next morning's Press.\r\n\r\nHe was in such a mood and ready for any false assumption or for any\r\nwicked slander, when a telegram was brought him. He opened it. It was\r\nfrom Stow-in-the-Wold; it begged Mr. Bailey to explain if possible and\r\nto make things right if it was not too late. Unfortunately within the\r\nnarrow limits of such a message it was impossible to give the nature\r\nof the accident that had happened, and William Bailey's most foolish\r\nsuppositions were only the more confirmed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSunday is not a good day for getting about. Mr. Bailey estimated\r\nthings, and rightly judged that the motor-car, forlorn in those far\r\nCotswold Hills, would be in no mood to return the eighty miles to town,\r\nand he saw that the trains of a Sunday were not the most convenient.\r\n\r\nHe let it stand till Monday, but that evening a figure worn with travel\r\nand shaken with unusual experience appeared before him. It was the\r\nfigure of Mr. Clutterbuck.\r\n\r\nHe recited the adventure at large; he had not dared look at the Sunday\r\npapers; he had come because he could not rest until he had heard news\r\nof the dreadful affair. He was almost incoherent in his rapidity.\r\nCharlie was back at the Plâs; he had seen Mrs. Clutterbuck a moment--he\r\nhad not told her. How had the constituency taken it, oh how had they\r\ntaken it?\r\n\r\n\"Like a lot of animals,\" said William Bailey with vivid memories of the\r\nnight, \"and not quiet animals either; like a lot of wolves,\" he said.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck was heart-broken. \"Couldn't something----\" he began.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, _no_!\" said William Bailey, really put out by the futility of\r\nthe phrase that was coming. \"No! Nothing! It's all over. When you're\r\ndefeated, retreat in good order--keep your train intact. _We're_\r\ndefeated all right!\" Then he had the absurd irrelevance to add: \"Come\r\ninto the House with me on Tuesday?\"\r\n\r\n\"But I'm not a member now,\" gasped Mr. Clutterbuck.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I mean under the gallery, just to look at it,\" said William Bailey\r\nimpatiently. \"I'm not a member now either, thank God! It's one of the\r\nfew things they can't force on a man nowadays.\" Such indeed is the\r\ncynical attitude of too many men who secretly know their own failure,\r\nand whom bad tactics, or more frequently adverse majorities, have\r\ndriven from the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nMr. Clutterbuck mournfully consented. He felt that impulse which the\r\nbereaved know so well, and which leads the widower to the freshly\r\ncovered grave.\r\n\r\nUpon Tuesday Mr. Bailey obtained for him the magnificent spectacle of\r\nthe opening of Parliament. Mr. Clutterbuck heard the King's Speech, saw\r\nthe peers in their robes, aye, and the peeresses too, and was glad to\r\nremember that there was one institution at least of a greater splendour\r\nthan that to which he might now never attain.\r\n\r\nAs they went out, Mr. Bailey said, _à propos_ of nothing: \"Sack\r\nCharlie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Fitzgerald.... Why on earth?\" said Mr. Clutterbuck with an open\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n\"Well, don't if you don't like: I won't interfere. Lunch to-morrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck, \"certainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right,\" said Mr. Bailey, \"and we'll get under the gallery.\"\r\n\r\nIn the train Mr. Bailey's advice echoed, and echoed ill in the\r\nmerchant's ears, but he had not been in the house ten minutes when he\r\nheard Charlie Fitzgerald's happy voice calling him, and begging for\r\ncongratulations.\r\n\r\nAny vague suspicions that might have passed through his mind were\r\ninstantly dispelled, as he told the news--but he told it, protesting\r\nhis willingness to continue his services if Mr. Clutterbuck desired to\r\nretain them. If he were free, however, Charlie had the option of a post\r\nin India.\r\n\r\nHis face was glorious with anticipation.\r\n\r\n\"In the Civil Service?\" said Mr. Clutterbuck innocently.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered Charlie with nonchalance, \"in some works out there, a\r\nsort of company; but I shall like it. It's mining, you know; it puts me\r\nright to the top at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll do well,\" said Mr. Clutterbuck, wringing his hand with more\r\nfamiliarity than he had yet shown, and remembering as a business man\r\nmust, the splendid organising power that lay behind the Irish ease of\r\nthe Daniel-Daniels-Fitzgeralds.\r\n\r\nNext day Mr. Bailey and Mr. Clutterbuck were watching the first\r\nworking day of the Session of 1912:--what thoughts passed through the\r\nmerchant's mind were much too deep for words as he noted one face after\r\nanother so long familiar to him in the comic journals, and heard, under\r\nthe disguise of their constituencies, names that shook the world. The\r\nwit, the intelligence, the judgment, the rhetoric overwhelmed him, and\r\nthere were two tears in his eyes as he looked.\r\n\r\nHe heard one timid supplementary question on the Anapootra Ruby Mines,\r\nthe thunderous cries for order that met it, and the sharp rebuke from\r\nthe chair: then suddenly William Bailey moved from his side--he had\r\nseen the young Prime Minister, flushed with glory, but touched as it\r\nseemed with fatigue, go out for a moment behind the Speaker's chair. He\r\nsaid to Mr. Clutterbuck, \"I'll be back in a moment,\" and he went off\r\nhurriedly through the lobbies.\r\n\r\nWilliam Bailey had one more task before him, and for once it was\r\ninnocuous. He passed through the well-known corridors to the Prime\r\nMinister's room, opened the door without knocking, nodded to the\r\nsecretary, and went in.\r\n\r\nThere are wearinesses in the common desert of political life, and an\r\nexception to its tedium, however anomalous or eccentric, will prove at\r\nsome moments refreshing. The young Prime Minister was really glad to\r\nsee the tall and absurd figure striding into the room, and he said:\r\n\"Good old Bill!\" with an accent of earlier times. Then he put his\r\nforearm squarely on the big official table, and before William Bailey\r\ncould speak, with his firm, half-smiling lips he said:\r\n\r\n\"It'll save you trouble, Bill, to know that whatever it is I'm not\r\ngoing to do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a pity,\" said William Bailey, \"for the first thing I was going\r\nto ask was whether you'd come to the Follies on Friday.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister was hugely relieved. \"There's no one else in London,\r\nBill, who comes into this particular room to ask that particular kind\r\nof question.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh?\" said Mr. Bailey thoughtfully. \"By the way,\" he went on, \"there's\r\nanother thing; old Clutterbuck's got to have it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, damn and blast old Clutterbuck,\" said the Prime Minister, jumping\r\nup from his chair as some men do when they see a black cat. \"Oh, it's\r\nperfectably intolerable! Whether it's Charlie, or whether it's Mary,\r\nor whether it's Bozzy, or whether it's you, you shoot out that word\r\n'Clutterbuck' the moment you've got the range. The only man in London\r\nwho has the decency to spare me Clutterbuck is the Peabody Yid.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Et pour cause_,\" said Mr. Bailey, who spoke French but rarely.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister began to smile, then checked himself.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think it can be done, Bill,\" he said gently. \"He's out of the\r\nway, I know, but it really would be too ridiculous. What would people\r\nsay?\"\r\n\r\n\"They wouldn't say anything,\" said Mr. Bailey, \"they never do say\r\nanything, and it has its advantages, you know: a friend's a friend and\r\nan enemy's an enemy; he's dreadfully sore just now. Besides which,\r\nwhat harm does it do a soul to give the poor chap a hoist? What harm\r\ndid it do any mortal soul even when the Peabody Yid bought his peerage?\r\nAnd _he_ bought the right to make interminable speeches with a lisp.\r\nI remember your father about him years ago: he was a godsend to your\r\nfather in the Lords; your father could do the Yid better than any one\r\nin London.\"\r\n\r\nMr. William Bailey indulged in an imitation of the lisp, and the Prime\r\nMinister, who also remembered his father's intense amusement, was\r\nmelted to another smile. He half gave way.\r\n\r\n\"The trouble is to find the recognition, you know,\" he said, \"'in\r\nrecognition'--in recognition of what? It's like the despatches from\r\nSouth Africa when they had to stick in every man Jack of them, or never\r\ndine again. But it's easier to give a D.S.O. because the public aren't\r\nthere looking on. What the devil has old Clutterbuck ever done?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" said Mr. Bailey gaily, \"he declared strongly against allowing the\r\nfall in Consols to go on, and in favour of a large gold reserve, and\r\none or two other things.\" Mr. Bailey looked the Prime Minister straight\r\nin the eye, and the Prime Minister's eye fell.\r\n\r\nHe took a pen and began drawing on the blotting-paper before him. \"Do\r\nsuggest something,\" he murmured.\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence.\r\n\r\n\"In recognition of his active services and labours in connection with\r\nthe Royal Caterham Valley Institute,\" said Mr. Bailey at last.\r\n\r\n\"What on earth's that?\" asked the Prime Minister, looking up blankly.\r\n\r\n\"We--ll, it doesn't exist--yet,\" said William Bailey, \"but it will, you\r\nknow, it will.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't mind,\" said the Prime Minister wearily, \"but it can't be\r\nbefore Easter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now I'll tell you,\" said William Bailey by way of finale; \"you\r\nwrite me a little note so that the poor fellow can be certain of Empire\r\nDay, and you will have done a really good deed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can trust you, Bill?\" said the young man anxiously. (How human they\r\nare!)\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes,\" said Mr. Bailey, \"I'll give you a hostage.\"\r\n\r\nHe wrote out a few words on a slip of paper, signed it, and handed it\r\nover to his relative.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister took it with a funny little laugh and threw it into\r\nthe fire.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be a fool, Bill,\" he said. \"Of course I can trust you.\"\r\n\r\nHe wrote on a sheet of notepaper:\r\n\r\n  \"My dear Mr. Bailey,\r\n\r\n  \"_I can well understand, but, as you will easily see, it is\r\n  impossible before Empire Day. I have, however, received commands upon\r\n  the matter with regard to that date, and I trust Mr.---- _\"\r\n\r\n\"Empire Day's in the season, isn't it?\" he added anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"At the beginning of the season,\" replied William Bailey solemnly,\r\n\"just before the middle class begin marrying into the plutocracy.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're quite right,\" said the Prime Minister seriously, \"only I wanted\r\nto get the date more or less right. One must have time, and there's\r\ngoing to be a list on Empire Day--anyhow it's after Easter\"--then he\r\nwent on writing.\r\n\r\n\"What's the name?\" he said in the middle of his writing.\r\n\r\n\"The name,\" said Mr. Bailey, \"was to be Percy, I think--yes, Percy.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Mr. Percy Clutterbuck_,\" the Prime Minister went on writing, \"_will\r\naccept your assurance and will use every discretion in the matter_.\" He\r\nwrote a few more lines and signed. \"There,\" he said, handing it over.\r\n\r\n\"You're a very good fellow,\" said William Bailey, taking the note and\r\nputting it carefully into a monstrous old-fashioned wallet. \"I'll send\r\nit back to you within a week--not necessarily for publication, but as a\r\nguarantee of good faith.\"\r\n\r\nAs he said this the Premier's secretary came in with the unpleasing\r\nnews that the deputation had come to time.\r\n\r\nWilliam Bailey hurriedly went out by the little private side door which\r\nhe knew so well.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was not until Mr. Bailey had successfully persuaded Mrs. Clutterbuck\r\nherself of the interest taken in the Highest Quarters in the Royal\r\nCaterham Valley Institute that he dared show that little note to\r\nher husband; but she--indomitable soul!--willingly accepted the\r\nopportunity at which he hinted. The bazaar was held, subscriptions\r\ngathered, Patronage of the most conspicuous sort received, the first\r\nstone of the Institute was laid with many allusions to the approaching\r\nfestival of Anglo-American goodwill. William Bailey had long returned\r\nthat dangerous little letter, and on that day which is now the chief\r\nfestival of our race, when so many and such varied qualities receive\r\ntheir high rewards, the storm-tossed spirit of Sir Percy Clutterbuck\r\nwas at rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n Printed by Ballantyne & Co.
