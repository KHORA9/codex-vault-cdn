Farragut was nominated to\r\nthe Senate for continuance as the flag-officer in command of the squadron\r\nwhich recently rendered such important service to the Union by his\r\nsuccessful operations on the lower Mississippi and capture of New Orleans.\r\n\r\nBelieving that no occasion could arise which would more fully correspond\r\nwith the intention of the law or be more pregnant with happy influence as\r\nan example, I cordially recommend that Captain D. G. Farragut receive a\r\nvote of thanks of Congress for his services and gallantry displayed in the\r\ncapture since 21st December, 1861, of Forts Jackson and St. Philip, city\r\nof New Orleans, and the destruction of various rebel gunboats, rams,\r\netc.....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nI submit herewith a list of naval officers who commanded vessels\r\nengaged in the recent brilliant operations of the squadron commanded by\r\nFlag-officer Farragut which led to the capture of Forts Jackson and St.\r\nPhilip, city of New Orleans, and the destruction of rebel gunboats, rams,\r\netc., in April 1862. For their services and gallantry on those occasions I\r\ncordially recommend that they should, by name, receive a vote of thanks of\r\nCongress:\r\n\r\nLIST:\r\n\r\n     Captain Theodorus Bailey.\r\n     Captain Henry W.

McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, May 15, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN, Cumberland, Virginia:\r\n\r\nYour long despatch of yesterday is just received. I will answer more fully\r\nsoon. Will say now that all your despatches to the Secretary of War have\r\nbeen promptly shown to me. Have done and shall do all I could and can to\r\nsustain you. Hoped that the opening of James River and putting Wool and\r\nBurnside in communication, with an open road to Richmond, or to you, had\r\neffected something in that direction. I am still unwilling to take all our\r\nforce off the direct line between Richmond and here.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH TO THE 12TH INDIANA REGIMENT, MAY [15?] 1862\r\n\r\nSOLDIERS, OF THE TWELFTH INDIANA REGIMENT:\r\n\r\nIt has not been customary heretofore, nor will it be hereafter, for me\r\nto say something to every regiment passing in review. It occurs too\r\nfrequently for me to have speeches ready on all occasions. As you have\r\npaid such a mark of respect to the chief magistrate, it appears that I\r\nshould say a word or two in reply. Your colonel has thought fit, on his\r\nown account and in your name, to say that you are satisfied with the\r\nmanner in which I have performed my part in the difficulties which have\r\nsurrounded the nation. For your kind expressions I am extremely grateful,\r\nbut on the other hand I assure you that the nation is more indebted to\r\nyou, and such as you, than to me. It is upon the brave hearts and strong\r\narms of the people of the country that our reliance has been placed in\r\nsupport of free government and free institutions.\r\n\r\nFor the part which you and the brave army of which you are a part have,\r\nunder Providence, performed in this great struggle, I tender more thanks\r\nespecially to this regiment, which has been the subject of good report.\r\nThe thanks of the nation will follow you, and may God's blessing rest upon\r\nyou now and forever. I hope that upon your return to your homes you will\r\nfind your friends and loved ones well and happy. I bid you farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL I. McDOWELL.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 16, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McDOWELL:\r\n\r\nWhat is the strength of your force now actually with you?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM OF PROPOSED ADDITIONS TO INSTRUCTIONS OF ABOVE DATE\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL McDOWELL, AND GENERAL MEIGS'S INDORSEMENT THEREON.\r\n\r\nMay 17, 1862. You will retain the separate command of the forces taken\r\nwith you; but while co-operating with General McClellan you will obey his\r\norders, except that you are to judge, and are not to allow your force to\r\nbe disposed otherwise than so as to give the greatest protection to this\r\ncapital which may be possible from that distance.\r\n\r\n[Indorsement.]\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF WAR:\r\n\r\nThe President having shown this to me, I suggested that it is dangerous to\r\ndirect a subordinate not to obey the orders of his superior in any case,\r\nand that to give instructions to General McClellan to this same end and\r\nfurnish General McDowell with a copy thereof would effect the object\r\ndesired by the President. He desired me to say that the sketch of\r\ninstructions to General McClellan herewith he thought made this addition\r\nunnecessary.\r\n\r\nRespectfully, M. C. M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMILITARY EMANCIPATION\r\n\r\nINDORSEMENT RELATING TO GENERAL DAVID HUNTER'S ORDER OF MILITARY\r\nEMANCIPATION,\r\n\r\nMAY 17, 1862\r\n\r\nNo commanding general shall do such a thing upon my responsibility without\r\nconsulting me.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM SECRETARY STANTON TO GENERAL McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 18, 1862.\r\n\r\nGENERAL: Your despatch to the President, asking reinforcements, has been\r\nreceived and carefully considered.\r\n\r\nThe President is not willing to uncover the capital entirely; and it is\r\nbelieved that, even if this were prudent, it would require more time to\r\neffect a junction between your army and that of the Rappahannock by\r\nthe way of the Potomac and York rivers than by a land march. In order,\r\ntherefore, to increase the strength of the attack upon Richmond at the\r\nearliest moment, General McDowell has been ordered to march upon that city\r\nby the shortest route. He is ordered, keeping himself always in position\r\nto save the capital from all possible attack, so to operate as to put his\r\nleft wing in communication with your right wing, and you are instructed\r\nto co-operate so as to establish this communication as soon as possible by\r\nextending your right-wing to the north of Richmond.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that this communication can be safely established either\r\nnorth or south of the Pamunkey River.\r\n\r\nIn any event, you will be able to prevent the main body of the enemy's\r\nforces from leaving Richmond and falling in overwhelming force upon\r\nGeneral McDowell. He will move with between thirty-five and forty thousand\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nA copy of the instructions to General McDowell are with this. The specific\r\ntask assigned to his command has been to provide against any danger to the\r\ncapital of the nation.\r\n\r\nAt your earnest call for reinforcements, he is sent forward to co-operate\r\nin the reduction of Richmond, but charged, in attempting this, not to\r\nuncover the city of Washington; and you will give no order, either before\r\nor after your junction, which can put him out of position to cover\r\nthis city. You and he will communicate with each other by telegraph or\r\notherwise as frequently as may be necessary for efficient cooperation.\r\nWhen General McDowell is in position on your right, his supplies must be\r\ndrawn from West Point, and you will instruct your staff-officers to be\r\nprepared to supply him by that route.\r\n\r\nThe President desires that General McDowell retain the command of the\r\nDepartment of the Rappahannock and of the forces with which he moves\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nBy order of the President:  EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL GEORGE B. McCLELLAN, Commanding Army of the Potomac, before\r\nRichmond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION REVOKING GENERAL HUNTER'S ORDER OF MILITARY EMANCIPATION,\r\n\r\nMAY 19, 1862.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation\r\n\r\nWhereas there appears in the public prints what purports to be a\r\nproclamation of Major general Hunter, in the words and figures following,\r\nto wit:\r\n\r\n(General Orders No. 11) HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH, HILTON HEAD,\r\nPORT ROYAL, S. C., May 9, 1862.\r\n\r\n\"The three States of Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina, comprising the\r\nmilitary department of the South, having deliberately declared themselves\r\nno longer under the protection of the United States of America, and\r\nhaving taken up arms against the said United States, it became a military\r\nnecessity to declare martial law. This was accordingly done on the\r\n25th day of April, 1862. Slavery and martial law in a free country are\r\naltogether incompatible. The persons in these three States: Georgia\r\nFlorida, and South Carolina--heretofore held as slaves are therefore\r\ndeclared forever free.\r\n\r\n\"By command of Major-General D. Hunter: \"(Official.)ED. W. SMITH, \"Acting\r\nAssistant Adjutant-General.\"\r\n\r\nAnd whereas the same is producing some excitement and misunderstanding:\r\ntherefore,\r\n\r\nI, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, proclaim and declare\r\nthat the Government of the United States, had no knowledge, information,\r\nor belief of an intention on the part of General Hunter to issue such a\r\nproclamation; nor has it yet any authentic information that the document\r\nis genuine. And further, that neither General Hunter nor any other\r\ncommander or person has been authorized by the Government of the United\r\nStates to make a proclamation declaring the slaves of any State free; and\r\nthat the supposed proclamation now in question, whether genuine or false,\r\nis altogether void so far as respects such a declaration.\r\n\r\nI further make known that whether it be competent for me, as\r\ncommander-in-chief of the army and navy, to declare the slaves of any\r\nState or States free, and whether, at any time, in any case, it shall have\r\nbecome a necessity indispensable to the maintenance of the government to\r\nexercise such supposed power, are questions which under my responsibility\r\nI reserve to myself, and which I cannot feel justified in leaving to the\r\ndecision of commanders in the field.\r\n\r\nThese are totally different questions from those of police regulations in\r\narmies and camps.\r\n\r\nOn the sixth day of March last, by special message, I recommended to\r\nCongress the adoption of a joint resolution, to be substantially as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nResolved, That the United States ought to co-operate with any State which\r\nmay adopt gradual abolishment of slavery, giving to such State pecuniary\r\naid, to be used by such State, in its discretion, to compensate for the\r\ninconvenience, public and private, produced by such change of system.\r\n\r\nThe resolution in the language above quoted was adopted by large\r\nmajorities in both branches of Congress, and now stands an authentic,\r\ndefinite, and solemn proposal of the nation to the States and people\r\nmost immediately interested in the subject-matter. To the people of those\r\nStates I now earnestly appeal. I do not argue--I beseech you to make\r\narguments for yourselves. You cannot, if you would, be blind to the signs\r\nof the times. I beg of you a calm and enlarged consideration of them,\r\nranging, if it may be, far above personal and partisan politics. This\r\nproposal makes common cause for a common object, casting no reproaches\r\nupon any. It acts not the Pharisee. The change it contemplates would come\r\ngently as the dews of heaven, not rending or wrecking anything. Will you\r\nnot embrace it? So much good has not been done, by one effort, in all past\r\ntime, as in the providence of God it is now your high privilege to do. May\r\nthe vast future not have to lament that you have neglected it.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the\r\nUnited States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this nineteenth day of May, in the year of\r\nour Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-two, and of the independence\r\nof the United States the eighty-sixth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:  WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. E. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 21, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nI have just been waited on by a large committee who present a petition\r\nsigned by twenty-three senators and eighty-four representatives asking me\r\nto restore General Hamilton to his division. I wish to do this, and yet I\r\ndo not wish to be understood as rebuking you. Please answer at once.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, May 22, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nYour long despatch of yesterday just received. You will have just such\r\ncontrol of General McDowell and his forces as you therein indicate.\r\nMcDowell can reach you by land sooner than he could get aboard of boats,\r\nif the boats were ready at Fredericksburg, unless his march shall be\r\nresisted, in which case the force resisting him will certainly not be\r\nconfronting you at Richmond. By land he can reach you in five days after\r\nstarting, whereas by water he would not reach you in two weeks, judging by\r\npast experience. Franklin's single division did not reach you in ten days\r\nafter I ordered it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN,\r\n\r\nPresident United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 24, 1862. 4 PM.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nIn consequence of General Banks's critical position, I have been compelled\r\nto suspend General McDowell's movements to join you. The enemy are making\r\na desperate push upon Harper's Ferry, and we are trying to throw General\r\nFremont's force and part of General McDowell's in their rear.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN, President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL McCLELLAN\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON May 24, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL GEORGE B. McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nI left General McDowell's camp at dark last evening. Shields's command is\r\nthere, but it is so worn that he cannot move before Monday morning, the\r\n26th. We have so thinned our line to get troops for other places that it\r\nwas broken yesterday at Front Royal, with a probable loss to us of one\r\nregiment infantry, two Companies cavalry, putting General Banks in some\r\nperil.\r\n\r\nThe enemy's forces under General Anderson now opposing General McDowell's\r\nadvance have as their line of supply and retreat the road to Richmond.\r\n\r\nIf, in conjunction with McDowell's movement against Anderson, you\r\ncould send a force from your right to cut off the enemy's supplies from\r\nRichmond, preserve the railroad bridges across the two forks of the\r\nPamunkey, and intercept the enemy's retreat, you will prevent the army\r\nnow opposed to you from receiving an accession of numbers of nearly 15,000\r\nmen; and if you succeed in saving the bridges you will secure a line of\r\nrailroad for supplies in addition to the one you now have. Can you not\r\ndo this almost as well as not while you are building the Chickahominy\r\nbridges? McDowell and Shields both say they can, and positively will, move\r\nMonday morning. I wish you to move cautiously and safely.\r\n\r\nYou will have command of McDowell, after he joins you, precisely as you\r\nindicated in your long despatch to us of the 21st.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL RUFUS SAXTON.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, May, 24 1862. 2 P.M.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SAXTON:\r\n\r\nGeary reports Jackson with 20,000 moving from Ashby's Gap by the Little\r\nRiver turnpike, through Aldie, toward Centreville. This he says is\r\nreliable. He is also informed of large forces south of him. We know\r\na force of some 15,000 broke up Saturday night from in front of\r\nFredericksburg and went we know not where. Please inform us, if possible,\r\nwhat has become of the force which pursued Banks yesterday; also any other\r\ninformation you have.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO COLONEL D. S. MILES.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, May 24, 1862. 1.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nCOLONEL MILES, Harper's Ferry, Virginia\r\n\r\nCould you not send scouts from Winchester who would tell whether enemy are\r\nnorth of Banks, moving on Winchester? What is the latest you have?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. C. FREMONT.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, May 24, 1862. 4 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL FREMONT, Franklin:\r\n\r\nYou are authorized to purchase the 400 horses, or take them wherever or\r\nhowever you can get them. The exposed condition of General Banks makes\r\nhis immediate relief a point of paramount importance. You are therefore\r\ndirected by the President to move against Jackson at Harrisonburg and\r\noperate against the enemy in such way as to relieve Banks. This movement\r\nmust be made immediately. You will acknowledge the receipt of this order,\r\nand specify the hour it is received by you.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. C. FREMONT.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, May 24, 1862. 7.15 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL FREMONT, Franklin, Virginia:\r\n\r\nMany thanks for the promptness with which you have answered that you will\r\nexecute the order. Much--perhaps all--depends upon the celerity with which\r\nyou can execute it. Put the utmost speed into it. Do not lose a minute.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, May 24, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, near Corinth, Mississippi:\r\n\r\nSeveral despatches from Assistant Secretary Scott and one from Governor\r\nMorton asking reinforcements for you have been received. I beg you to be\r\nassured we do the best we can. I mean to cast no blame where I tell you\r\neach of our commanders along our line from Richmond to Corinth supposes\r\nhimself to be confronted by numbers superior to his own. Under this\r\npressure We thinned the line on the upper Potomac, until yesterday it was\r\nbroken with heavy loss to us, and General Banks put in great peril, out of\r\nwhich he is not yet extricated, and may be actually captured. We need men\r\nto repair this breach, and have them not at hand. My dear General, I feel\r\njustified to rely very much on you. I believe you and the brave officers\r\nand men with you can and will get the victory at Corinth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL I. McDOWELL\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, May 24, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McDOWELL, Fredricksburg:\r\n\r\nGeneral Fremont has been ordered by telegraph to move from Franklin on\r\nHarrisonburg to relieve General Banks, and capture or destroy Jackson's\r\nand Ewell's forces. You are instructed, laying aside for the present\r\nthe movement on Richmond, to put 20,000 men in motion at once for the\r\nShenandoah, moving on the line or in advance of the line of the Manassas\r\nGap railroad. Your object will be to capture the forces of Jackson and\r\nEwell, either in co-operation with General Fremont, or, in case want\r\nof supplies or of transportation, interferes with his movements, it is\r\nbelieved that the force which you move will be sufficient to accomplish\r\nthis object alone. The information thus far received here makes it\r\nprobable that if the enemy operate actively against General Banks, you\r\nwill not be able to count upon much assistance from him, but may even have\r\nto release him. Reports received this moment are that Banks is fighting\r\nwith Ewell eight miles from Winchester.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL McDOWELL.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, D.C., May 24, 1862\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL I. McDOWELL:\r\n\r\nI am highly gratified by your alacrity in obeying my order. The change was\r\nas painful to me as it can possibly be to you or to any one. Everything\r\nnow depends upon the celerity and vigor of your movement.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. W. GEARY.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, May 25, 1862 1.45 P.M.\r\n\r\nGENERAL GEARY, White Plains:\r\n\r\nPlease give us your best present impression as to the number of the\r\nenemy's forces north of Strasburg and Front Royal. Are the forces still\r\nmoving north through the gap at Front Royal and between you and there?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 25, 1862. 2 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nThe enemy is moving north in sufficient force to drive General Banks\r\nbefore him--precisely in what force we cannot tell. He is also threatening\r\nLeesburg and Geary, on the Manassas Gap railroad, from both north and\r\nsouth--in precisely what force we cannot tell. I think the movement is a\r\ngeneral and concerted one, such as would not be if he was acting upon the\r\npurpose of a very desperate defense of Richmond. I think the time is near\r\nwhen you must either attack Richmond or give up the job and come to the\r\ndefense of Washington. Let me hear from you instantly.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN, President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER TAKING MILITARY POSSESSION OF RAILROADS.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, May 25, 1862.\r\n\r\nOrdered: By virtue of the authority vested by act of Congress, the\r\nPresident takes military possession of all the railroads in the United\r\nStates from and after this date until further order, and directs that the\r\nrespective railroad companies, their officers and servants, shall\r\nhold themselves in readiness for the transportation of such troops and\r\nmunitions of war as may be ordered by the military authorities, to the\r\nexclusion of all other business.\r\n\r\nBy order of the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nM. C. MEIGS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO SECRETARY CHASE.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, May 25, 1862.\r\n\r\nSECRETARY CHASE, Fredericksburg, Virginia:\r\n\r\nIt now appears that Banks got safely into Winchester last night, and is\r\nthis morning retreating on Harper's Ferry. This justifies the inference\r\nthat he is pressed by numbers superior to his own. I think it not\r\nimprobable that Ewell, Jackson, and Johnson are pouring through the gap\r\nthey made day before yesterday at Front Royal, making a dash northward. It\r\nwill be a very valuable and very honorable service for General McDowell\r\nto cut them off. I hope he will put all possible energy and speed into the\r\neffort.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL R. SAXTON.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, May 25, 1862.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SAXTON, Harper's Ferry:\r\n\r\nIf Banks reaches Martinsburg, is he any the better for it? Will not the\r\nenemy cut him from thence to Harper's Ferry? Have you sent anything to\r\nmeet him and assist him at Martinsburg? This is an inquiry, not an order.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL R. SAXTON.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, May 25, 1862. 6.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SAXTON, Harper's Ferry:\r\n\r\nOne good six-gun battery, complete in its men and appointments, is now on\r\nits way to you from Baltimore. Eleven other guns, of different sorts,\r\nare on their way to you from here. Hope they will all reach you before\r\nmorning. As you have but 2500 men at Harper's Ferry, where are the rest\r\nwhich were in that vicinity and which we have sent forward? Have any of\r\nthem been cut off?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL R. SAXTON.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, May 25, 1862.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SAXTON, Harper's Ferry:\r\n\r\nI fear you have mistaken me. I did not mean to question the correctness of\r\nyour conduct; on the contrary! I approve what you have done. As the 2500\r\nreported by you seemed small to me, I feared some had got to Banks and\r\nbeen cut off with him. Please tell me the exact number you now have in\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\n[Sent in cipher.]\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, D. C., May 25,1862. 8.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nYour despatch received. General Banks was at Strasburg, with about 6,000\r\nmen, Shields having been taken from him to swell a column for McDowell\r\nto aid you at Richmond, and the rest of his force scattered at various\r\nplaces. On the 23d a rebel force of 7000 to 10,000 fell upon one regiment\r\nand two companies guarding the bridge at Front Royal, destroying it\r\nentirely; crossed the Shenandoah, and on the 24th (yesterday) pushed to\r\nget north of Banks, on the road to Winchester. Banks ran a race with them,\r\nbeating them into Winchester yesterday evening. This morning a battle\r\nensued between the two forces, in which Banks was beaten back into full\r\nretreat toward Martinsburg, and probably is broken up into a total rout.\r\nGeary, on the Manassas Gap railroad, just now reports that Jackson is\r\nnow near Front Royal, With 10,000, following up and supporting, as I\r\nunderstand, the forces now pursuing Banks, also that another force of\r\n10,000 is near Orleans, following on in the same direction. Stripped here,\r\nas we are here, it will be all we can do to prevent them crossing the\r\nPotomac at Harper's Ferry or above. We have about 20,000 of McDowell's\r\nforce moving back to the vicinity of Front Royal, and General Fremont, who\r\nwas at Franklin, is moving to Harrisonburg; both these movements intended\r\nto get in the enemy's rear.\r\n\r\nOne more of McDowell's brigades is ordered through here to Harper's Ferry;\r\nthe rest of his force remains for the present at Fredericksburg. We are\r\nsending such regiments and dribs from here and Baltimore as we can spare\r\nto Harper's Ferry, supplying their places in some sort by calling in\r\nmilitia from the adjacent States. We also have eighteen cannon on the\r\nroad to Harper's Ferry, of which arm there is not a single one yet at that\r\npoint. This is now our situation.\r\n\r\nIf McDowell's force was now beyond our reach, we should be utterly\r\nhelpless. Apprehension of something like this, and no unwillingness to\r\nsustain you, has always been my reason for withholding McDowell's force\r\nfrom you. Please understand this, and do the best you can with the force\r\nyou have.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF CONSPIRACY OF REBELLION\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nMAY 16, 1862\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nThe insurrection which is yet existing in the United States and aims at\r\nthe overthrow of the Federal Constitution and the Union, was clandestinely\r\nprepared during the Winter of 1860 and 1861, and assumed an open\r\norganization in the form of a treasonable provisional government at\r\nMontgomery, in Alabama on the 18th day of February, 1861. On the 12th day\r\nof April, 1861, the insurgents committed the flagrant act of civil war by\r\nthe bombardment and the capture of Fort Sumter, Which cut off the hope of\r\nimmediate conciliation. Immediately afterward all the roads and avenues to\r\nthis city were obstructed, and the capital was put into the condition of\r\na siege. The mails in every direction were stopped and the lines of\r\ntelegraph cut off by the insurgents, and military and naval forces which\r\nhad been called out by the government for the defense of Washington were\r\nprevented from reaching the city by organized and combined treasonable\r\nresistance in the State of Maryland. There was no adequate and effective\r\norganization for the public defense. Congress had indefinitely adjourned.\r\nThere was no time to convene them. It became necessary for me to choose\r\nwhether, using only the existing means, agencies, and processes which\r\nCongress had provided, I should let the government fall at once into\r\nruin or whether, availing myself of the broader powers conferred by the\r\nConstitution in cases of insurrection, I would make an effort to save it,\r\nwith all its blessings, for the present age and for posterity.\r\n\r\nI thereupon summoned my constitutional advisers, the heads of all the\r\ndepartments, to meet on Sunday, the 20th day of April, 1861, at the\r\noffice of the Navy Department, and then and there, with their unanimous\r\nconcurrence, I directed that an armed revenue cutter should proceed to\r\nsea to afford protection to the commercial marine, and especially the\r\nCalifornia treasure ships then on their way to this coast. I also directed\r\nthe commandant of the navy-yard at Boston to purchase or charter and arm\r\nas quickly as possible five steamships for purposes of public defense. I\r\ndirected the commandant of the navy-yard at Philadelphia to purchase\r\nor charter and arm an equal number for the same purpose. I directed the\r\ncommandant at New York to purchase or charter and arm an equal number. I\r\ndirected Commander Gillis to purchase or charter and arm and put to sea\r\ntwo other vessels. Similar directions were given to Commodore Dupont,\r\nwith a view to the opening of passages by water to and from the capital.\r\nI directed the several officers to take the advice and obtain the aid and\r\nefficient services, in the matter, of his Excellency Edwin D. Morgan,\r\nthe Governor of New York, or in his absence George D. Morgan, William M.\r\nEvarts, R. M. Blatchford, and Moses H. Grinnell, who were by my directions\r\nespecially empowered by the Secretary of the Navy to act for his\r\ndepartment in that crisis in matters pertaining to the forwarding of\r\ntroops and supplies for the public defense.\r\n\r\nThe several departments of the government at that time contained so large\r\na number of disloyal persons that it would have been impossible to provide\r\nsafely through official agents only for the performance of the duties\r\nthus confided to citizens favorably known for their ability, loyalty, and\r\npatriotism.\r\n\r\nThe several orders issued upon these occurrences were transmitted by\r\nprivate messengers, who pursued a circuitous way to the seaboard cities,\r\ninland across the States of Pennsylvania and Ohio and the northern lakes.\r\nI believe by these and other similar measures taken in that crisis, some\r\nof which were without any authority of law, the government was saved from\r\noverthrow. I am not aware that a dollar of the public funds thus confided\r\nwithout authority of law to unofficial persons was either lost or wasted,\r\nalthough apprehensions of such misdirection occurred to me as objections\r\nto those extraordinary proceedings, and were necessarily overruled.\r\n\r\nI recall these transactions now because my attention has been directed to\r\na resolution which was passed by the House of Representatives on the 30th\r\nday of last month, which is in these words:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That Simon Cameron, late Secretary of War by investing\r\nAlexander Cummings with the control of large sums of the public money\r\nand authority to purchase military supplies without restriction, without\r\nrequiring from him any guaranty for the faithful performance of his\r\nduties, when the services of competent public officers were available, and\r\nby involving the government in a vast number of contracts with persons not\r\nlegitimately engaged in the business pertaining to the subject-matter of\r\nsuch contracts, especially in the purchase of arms for future delivery,\r\nhas adopted a policy highly injurious to the public service, and deserves\r\nthe censure of the House.\"\r\n\r\nCongress will see that I should be wanting equally in candor and in\r\njustice if I should leave the censure expressed in this resolution to rest\r\nexclusively or chiefly upon Mr. Cameron. The same sentiment is unanimously\r\nentertained by the heads of department who participated in the proceedings\r\nwhich the House of Representatives have censured. It is due to Mr. Cameron\r\nto say that although he fully approved the proceedings they were not moved\r\nnor suggested by himself, and that not only the President, but all the\r\nother heads of departments, were at least equally responsible with him for\r\nwhatever error, wrong, or fault was committed in the premises.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 26, 1862. 12.40\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nWe have General Banks's official report. He has saved his army and\r\nbaggage, and has made a safe retreat to the river, and is probably safe at\r\nWilliamsport. He reports the attacking force at 15,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN, President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL I. McDOWELL.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, May 26, 1862. 1 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McDOWELL, Falmouth, Virginia:\r\n\r\nDespatches from Geary just received have been sent you. Should not\r\nthe remainder of your forces, except sufficient to hold the point at\r\nFredericksburg, move this way--to Manassas Junction or Alexandria?\r\nAs commander of this department, should you not be here? I ask these\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 26, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL GEORGE B. McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nCan you not cut the Alula Creek railroad? Also, what impression have you\r\nas to intrenched works for you to contend with in front of Richmond? Can\r\nyou get near enough to throw shells into the city?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN, President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. C. FREMONT.\r\n\r\nMay 27.1862. 9.58 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL FREMONT:\r\n\r\nI see that you are at Moorefield. You were expressly ordered to march to\r\nHarrisonburg. What does this mean?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM FROM SECRETARY STANTON TO GOVERNOR ANDREW.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 27, 1862.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR ANDREW, Boston:\r\n\r\nThe President directs that the militia be relieved, and the enlistments\r\nmade for three years, or during the war. This, I think, will practically\r\nnot be longer than for a year. The latest intelligence from General Banks\r\nstates that he has saved nearly his whole command with small loss.\r\n\r\nConcentrations of our force have been made, which it is hoped will capture\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM FROM SECRETARY STANTON TO GENERAL J. C. FREMONT,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 28, 1862\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL FREMONT, Moorefield\r\n\r\nThe President directs you to halt at Moorefield and await orders, unless\r\nyou hear of the enemy being in the general direction of Rodney, in which\r\ncase you will move upon him. Acknowledge the receipt of this order, and\r\nthe hour it is received.\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL I. McDOWELL.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 28, 1862.\r\n\r\nGENERAL McDOWELL, Manassas Junction:\r\n\r\nGeneral McClellan at 6.30 P.M. yesterday telegraphed that Fitz-John\r\nPorter's division had fought and driven 13,000 of the enemy, under General\r\nBranch, from Hanover Court-House, and was driving them from a stand they\r\nhad made on the railroad at the time the messenger left. Two hours later\r\nhe telegraphed that Stoneman had captured an engine and six cars on\r\nthe Virginia Central, which he at once sent to communicate with Porter.\r\nNothing further from McClellan.\r\n\r\nIf Porter effects a lodgment on both railroads near Hanover Court-House,\r\nconsider whether your forces in front of Fredericksburg should not push\r\nthrough and join him.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 28, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nWhat of F.J. Porter's expedition? Please answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL I. McDOWELL.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON. May 28, 1862. 4 P.M.\r\n\r\nGENERAL McDOWELL, Manassas Junction:\r\n\r\nYou say General Geary's scouts report that they find no enemy this side of\r\nthe Blue Ridge. Neither do I. Have they been to the Blue Ridge looking for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL I. McDOWELL.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 28, 1862. 5.40 P.M.\r\n\r\nGENERAL McDOWELL, Manassas Junction:\r\n\r\nI think the evidence now preponderates that Ewell and Jackson are still\r\nabout Winchester. Assuming this, it is for you a question of legs. Put in\r\nall the speed you can. I have told Fremont as much, and directed him to\r\ndrive at them as fast as possible. By the way, I suppose you know Fremont\r\nhas got up to Moorefield, instead of going into Harrisonburg.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON May 28, 1862. 8.40 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nI am very glad of General F. J. Porter's victory. Still, if it was a\r\ntotal rout of the enemy, I am puzzled to know why the Richmond and\r\nFredericksburg railroad was not seized again, as you say you have all the\r\nrailroads but the Richmond and Fredericksburg. I am puzzled to see how,\r\nlacking that, you can have any, except the scrap from Richmond to\r\nWest Point. The scrap of the Virginia Central from Richmond to Hanover\r\nJunction, without more, is simply nothing. That the whole of the enemy is\r\nconcentrating on Richmond, I think cannot be certainly known to you or\r\nme. Saxton, at Harper's Ferry informs us that large forces, supposed to be\r\nJackson's and Ewells, forced his advance from Charlestown today. General\r\nKing telegraphs us from Fredericksburg that contrabands give certain\r\ninformation that 15,000 left Hanover Junction Monday morning to reinforce\r\nJackson. I am painfully impressed with the importance of the struggle\r\nbefore you, and shall aid you all I can consistently with my view of due\r\nregard to all points.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM FROM SECRETARY STANTON TO GENERAL FREMONT.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 28, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL JOHN C. FREMONT, Moorefield:\r\n\r\nThe order to remain at Moorefield was based on the supposition that it\r\nwould find you there.\r\n\r\nUpon subsequent information that the enemy were still operating in the\r\nvicinity of Winchester and Martinsburg, you were directed to move against\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\nThe President now again directs you to move against the enemy without\r\ndelay. Please acknowledge the receipt of this, and the time received.\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL MARCY.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 29, 1862. 10 A.M.\r\n\r\nGENERAL R. B. MARCY, McClellan's Headquarters:\r\n\r\nYours just received. I think it cannot be certainly known whether the\r\nforce which fought General Porter is the same which recently confronted\r\nMcDowell. Another item of evidence bearing on it is that General Branch\r\ncommanded against Porter, while it was General Anderson who was in front\r\nof McDowell. He and McDowell were in correspondence about prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, D. C., May 29, 1862. 10.30 A.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nI think we shall be able within three days to tell you certainly whether\r\nany considerable force of the enemy--Jackson or any one else--is moving\r\non to Harper's Ferry or vicinity. Take this expected development into your\r\ncalculations.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL N. P. BANKS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 29, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BANKS, Williamsport, Maryland:\r\n\r\nGeneral McDowell's advance should, and probably will, be at or near\r\nFront Royal at twelve (noon) tomorrow. General Fremont will be at or near\r\nStrasburg as soon. Please watch the enemy closely, and follow and harass\r\nand detain him if he attempts to retire. I mean this for General Saxton's\r\nforce as well as that immediately with you.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL FREMONT\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 29, 1862. 12 M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL FREMONT, Moorefield, Virginia:\r\n\r\nGeneral McDowell's advance, if not checked by the enemy, should, and\r\nprobably will, be at Front Royal by twelve (noon) to-morrow. His force,\r\nwhen up, will be about 20,000. Please have your force at Strasburg, or, if\r\nthe route you are moving on does not lead to that point, as near Strasburg\r\nas the enemy may be by the same time. Your despatch No.30 received and\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL I. McDOWELL.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 29, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McDOWELL, Manassas Junction:\r\n\r\nGeneral Fremont's force should, and probably will, be at or near Strasburg\r\nby twelve (noon) tomorrow. Try to have your force, or the advance of it,\r\nat Front Royal as soon.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL MARCY.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 29, 1862. 1.20 P.M.\r\n\r\nGENERAL R. B. MARCY:\r\n\r\nYour despatch as to the South Anna and Ashland being seized by our forces\r\nthis morning is received. Understanding these points to be on the Richmond\r\nand Fredericksburg railroad, I heartily congratulate the country, and\r\nthank General McClellan and his army for their seizure.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL I. McDOWELL.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 30, 1862. 10 A.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McDOWELL, Manassas Junction:\r\n\r\nI somewhat apprehend that Fremont's force, in its present condition, may\r\nnot be quite strong enough in case it comes in collision with the enemy.\r\nFor this additional reason I wish you to push forward your column as\r\nrapidly as possible. Tell me what number your force reaching Front Royal\r\nwill amount to.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL N. P. BANKS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 30, 1862. 10.15 A.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BANKS,\r\n\r\nWilliamsport, Maryland, via Harper's Ferry:\r\n\r\nIf the enemy in force is in or about Martinsburg, Charlestown, and\r\nWinchester, Or any or all of them, he may come in collision with Fremont,\r\nin which case I am anxious that your force, with you and at Harper's\r\nFerry, should so operate as to assist Fremont if possible; the same if\r\nthe enemy should engage McDowell. This was the meaning of my despatch\r\nyesterday.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL I. McDOWELL.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 30, 1862. 12.40.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McDOWELL, Rectortown:\r\n\r\nYour despatch of to-day received and is satisfactory. Fremont has\r\nnominally 22,000, really about 17,000. Blenker's division is part of it. I\r\nhave a despatch from Fremont this morning, not telling me where he is; but\r\nhe says:\r\n\r\n\"Scouts and men from Winchester represent Jackson's force variously at\r\n30,000 to 60,000. With him Generals Ewell and Longstreet.\"\r\n\r\nThe high figures erroneous, of course. Do you know where Longstreet is?\r\nCorinth is evacuated and occupied by us.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL FREMONT.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 30, 1862. 2.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL FREMONT, Moorefield, Virginia:\r\n\r\nYours, saying you will reach Strasburg or vicinity at 5 P.M. Saturday, has\r\nbeen received and sent to General McDowell, and he directed to act in view\r\nof it. You must be up to the time you promised, if possible.\r\n\r\nCorinth was evacuated last night, and is occupied by our troops to-day;\r\nthe enemy gone south to Okolotia, on the railroad to Mobile.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL I. McDOWELL.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT WASHINGTON CITY, May 30, 1862.9.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McDOWELL, Rectortown, Va.:\r\n\r\nI send you a despatch just received from Saxton at Harper's Ferry: \"The\r\nrebels are in line of battle in front of our lines. They have nine pieces\r\nof artillery, and in position, and cavalry. I shelled the woods in which\r\nthey were, and they in return threw a large number of shells into the\r\nlines and tents from which I moved last night to take up a stronger\r\nposition. I expect a great deal from the battery on the mountain, having\r\nthree 9 inch Dahlgren bearing directly on the enemy's approaches. The\r\nenemy appeared this morning and then retired, with the intention of\r\ndrawing us on. I shall act on the defensive, as my position is a strong\r\none. In a skirmish which took place this afternoon I lost one horse, The\r\nenemy lost two men killed and seven wounded.\r\n\r\n\"R. SAXTON, Brigadier General.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems the game is before you. Have sent a copy to General Fremont.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 31, 1862. 10.20 PM.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nA circle whose circumference shall pass through Harper's Ferry, Front\r\nRoyal, and Strasburg, and whose center shall be a little northeast of\r\nWinchester, almost certainly has within it this morning the forces of\r\nJackson, Ewell, and Edward Johnson. Quite certainly they were within it\r\ntwo days ago. Some part of their forces attacked Harper's Ferry at\r\ndark last evening, and are still in sight this morning. Shields, with\r\nMcDowell's advance, retook Front Royal at 11 A.M. yesterday, with a\r\ndozen of our own prisoners taken there a week ago, 150 of the enemy, two\r\nlocomotives, and eleven cars, some other property and stores, and saved\r\nthe bridge.\r\n\r\nGeneral Fremont, from the direction of Moorefield, promises to be at or\r\nnear Strasburg at 5 P.M. to-day. General Banks at Williamsport, with his\r\nold force and his new force at Harper's Ferry, is directed to co-operate.\r\nShields at Front Royal reports a rumor of still an additional force of the\r\nenemy, supposed to be Anderson's, having entered the valley of Virginia.\r\nThis last may or may not be true. Corinth is certainly in the hands of\r\nGeneral Halleck.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM FROM SECRETARY STANTON\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL G. A. McCALL, WASHINGTON, May 31, 1562.\r\n\r\nGENERAL McCALL:\r\n\r\nThe President directs me to say to you that there can be nothing to\r\njustify a panic at Fredericksburg. He expects you to maintain your\r\nposition there as becomes a soldier and a general.\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, D.C., June 1, 1862. 9.30.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nYou are probably engaged with the enemy. I suppose he made the attack.\r\nStand well on your guard, hold all your ground, or yield any only inch by\r\ninch and in good order. This morning we merge General Wool's department\r\ninto yours, giving you command of the whole, and sending General Dix to\r\nPort Monroe and General Wool to Fort McHenry. We also send General Sigel\r\nto report to you for duty.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, June 3, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nWith these continuous rains I am very anxious about the Chickahominy so\r\nclose in your rear and crossing your line of communication.

McDOWELL.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, June 3, 1862. 6.15 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McDOWELL, Front Royal, Virginia:\r\n\r\nAnxious to know whether Shields can head or flank Jackson. Please tell\r\nabout where Shields and Jackson, respectively, are at the time this\r\nreaches you.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, June 4, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Corinth:\r\n\r\nYour despatch of to-day to Secretary of War received. Thanks for the good\r\nnews it brings.\r\n\r\nHave you anything from Memphis or other parts of the Mississippi River?\r\nPlease answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n[cipher.]\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, June 4, 1862.\r\n\r\nHON. ANDREW JOHNSON, Nashville, Tennessee:\r\n\r\nDo you really wish to have control of the question of releasing rebel\r\nprisoners so far as they may be Tennesseeans? If you do, please tell us\r\nso. Your answer not to be made public.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\n[Cipher.]\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.C., June 7, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nYour despatch about Chattanooga and Dalton was duly received and sent to\r\nGeneral Halleck. I have just received the following answer from him:\r\n\r\nWe have Fort Pillow, Randolph, and Memphis.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, June 8, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Corinth, Mississippi:\r\n\r\nWe are changing one of the departmental lines, so as to give you all\r\nof Kentucky and Tennessee. In your movement upon Chattanooga I think it\r\nprobable that you include some combination of the force near Cumberland\r\nGap under General Morgan.\r\n\r\nDo you?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL N. P. BANKS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, June 9, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BANKS, Winchester:\r\n\r\nWe are arranging a general plan for the valley of the Shenandoah, and in\r\naccordance with this you will move your main force to the Shenandoah at or\r\nopposite Front Royal as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. C. FREMONT.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, June 9, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL FREMONT:\r\n\r\nHalt at Harrisonburg, pursuing Jackson no farther. Get your force well in\r\nhand and stand on the defensive, guarding against a movement of the enemy\r\neither back toward Strasburg or toward Franklin, and await further orders,\r\nwhich will soon be sent you.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n[Cipher.]\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, June 9, 1862.\r\n\r\nHON. ANDREW JOHNSON, Nashville, 'Tennessee:\r\n\r\nYour despatch about seizing seventy rebels to exchange for a like\r\nnumber of Union men was duly received. I certainly do not disapprove the\r\nproposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL J. C. FREMONT. WASHINGTON, June 12, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL FREMONT:\r\n\r\nAccounts, which we do not credit, represent that Jackson is largely\r\nreinforced and turning upon you. Get your forces well in hand and keep us\r\nwell and frequently advised; and if you find yourself really pressed by a\r\nsuperior force of the enemy, fall back cautiously toward or to Winchester,\r\nand we will have in due time Banks in position to sustain you. Do not\r\nfall back upon Harrisonburg unless upon tolerably clear necessity. We\r\nunderstand Jackson is on the other side of the Shenandoah from you, and\r\nhence cannot in any event press you into any necessity of a precipitate\r\nwithdrawal.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Yours, preferring Mount Jackson to Harrisonburg, is just received.\r\nOn this point use your discretion, remembering that our object is to give\r\nsuch protection as you can to western Virginia. Many thanks to yourself,\r\nofficers, and men for the gallant battle of last Sunday. A. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\r\n\r\nJune 13, 1862.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: I herewith\r\ntransmit a memorial addressed and presented to me in behalf of the State\r\nof New York in favor of enlarging the locks of the Erie and Oswego Canal.\r\nWhile I have not given nor have leisure to give the subject a careful\r\nexamination, its great importance is obvious and unquestionable. The large\r\namount of valuable statistical information which is collated and presented\r\nin the memorial will greatly facilitate the mature consideration of the\r\nsubject, which I respectfully ask for it at your hands.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL J. C. FREMONT.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON; June 13. 1862\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL FREMONT:\r\n\r\nWe cannot afford to keep your force and Banks's and McDowell's engaged\r\nin keeping Jackson south of Strasburg and Front Royal. You fought Jackson\r\nalone and worsted him. He can have no substantial reinforcements so long\r\nas a battle is pending at Richmond. Surely you and Banks in supporting\r\ndistance are capable of keeping him from returning to Winchester. But if\r\nSigel be sent forward to you, and McDowell (as he must) be put to other\r\nwork, Jackson will break through at Front Royal again. He is already on\r\nthe right side of the Shenandoah to do it, and on the wrong side of it to\r\nattack you. The orders already sent you and Banks place you and him in the\r\nproper positions for the work assigned you. Jackson cannot move his whole\r\nforce on either of you before the other can learn of it and go to his\r\nassistance. He cannot divide his force, sending part against each of you,\r\nbecause he will be too weak for either. Please do as I directed in the\r\norder of the 8th and my despatch of yesterday, the 12th, and neither you\r\nnor Banks will be overwhelmed by Jackson. By proper scout lookouts, and\r\nbeacons of smoke by day and fires by night you can always have timely\r\nnotice of the enemy's approach. I know not as to you, but by some this has\r\nbeen too much neglected.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL J. C. FREMONT\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, D. C., June 15, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL FREMONT:\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Your letter of the 12th by Colonel Zagonyi is just received.\r\nIn answer to the principal part of it, I repeat the substance of an order\r\nof the 8th and one or two telegraphic despatches sent you since.\r\n\r\nWe have no definite power of sending reinforcements; so that we are\r\ncompelled rather to consider the proper disposal of the forces we have\r\nthan of those we could wish to have. We may be able to send you some dribs\r\nby degrees, but I do not believe we can do more. As you alone beat Jackson\r\nlast Sunday, I argue that you are stronger than he is to-day, unless he\r\nhas been reinforced; and that he cannot have been materially reinforced,\r\nbecause such reinforcement could only have come from Richmond, and he\r\nis much more likely to go to Richmond than Richmond is to come to him.\r\nNeither is very likely. I think Jackson's game--his assigned work--now is\r\nto magnify the accounts of his numbers and reports of his movements, and\r\nthus by constant alarms keep three or four times as many of our troops\r\naway from Richmond as his own force amounts to. Thus he helps his friends\r\nat Richmond three or four times as much as if he were there. Our game is\r\nnot to allow this. Accordingly, by the order of the 8th, I directed you\r\nto halt at Harrisonburg, rest your force, and get it well in hand, the\r\nobjects being to guard against Jackson's returning by the same route to\r\nthe upper Potomac over which you have just driven him out, and at the same\r\ntime give some protection against a raid into West Virginia.\r\n\r\nAlready I have given you discretion to occupy Mount Jackson instead,\r\nif, on full consideration, you think best. I do not believe Jackson will\r\nattack you, but certainly he cannot attack you by surprise; and if he\r\ncomes upon you in superior force, you have but to notify us, fall back\r\ncautiously, and Banks will join you in due time. But while we know not\r\nwhether Jackson will move at all, or by what route, we cannot safely put\r\nyou and Banks both on the Strasburg line, and leave no force on the Front\r\nRoyal line--the very line upon which he prosecuted his late raid. The true\r\npolicy is to place one of you on one line and the other on the other in\r\nsuch positions that you can unite once you actually find Jackson moving\r\nupon it. And this is precisely what we are doing. This protects that\r\npart of our frontier, so to speak, and liberates McDowell to go to the\r\nassistance of McClellan. I have arranged this, and am very unwilling to\r\nhave it deranged. While you have only asked for Sigel, I have spoken only\r\nof Banks, and this because Sigel's force is now the principal part of\r\nBank's force.\r\n\r\nAbout transferring General Schenck's commands, the purchase of supplies,\r\nand the promotion and appointment of officers, mentioned in your letter, I\r\nwill consult with the Secretary of War to-morrow.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL J. C. FREMONT.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, June 16, 1862\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL FREMONT, Mount Jackson, Virginia:\r\n\r\nYour despatch of yesterday, reminding me of a supposed understanding\r\nthat I would furnish you a corps of 35,000 men, and asking of me the\r\n\"fulfilment of this understanding,\" is received. I am ready to come to a\r\nfair settlement of accounts with you on the fulfilment of understandings.\r\n\r\nEarly in March last, when I assigned you to the command of the Mountain\r\nDepartment, I did tell you I would give you all the force I could, and\r\nthat I hoped to make it reach 35,000. You at the same time told me that\r\nwithin a reasonable time you would seize the railroad at or east of\r\nKnoxville, Tenn., if you could. There was then in the department a force\r\nsupposed to be 25,000, the exact number as well known to you as to me.\r\nAfter looking about two or three days, you called and distinctly told\r\nme that if I would add the Blenker division to the force already in the\r\ndepartment, you would undertake the job. The Blenker division contained\r\n10,000, and at the expense of great dissatisfaction to General McClellan\r\nI took it from his army and gave it to you. My promise was literally\r\nfulfilled. I have given you all I could, and I have given you very nearly,\r\nif not quite, 35,000.\r\n\r\nNow for yours. On the 23d of May, largely over two months afterward, you\r\nwere at Franklin, Va., not within 300 miles of Knoxville, nor within 80\r\nmiles of any part of the railroad east of it, and not moving forward, but\r\ntelegraphing here that you could not move for lack of everything. Now,\r\ndo not misunderstand me. I do not say you have not done all you could. I\r\npresume you met unexpected difficulties; and I beg you to believe that as\r\nsurely as you have done your best, so have I. I have not the power now to\r\nfill up your Corps to 35,000. I am not demanding of you to do the work of\r\n35,000. I am only asking of you to stand cautiously on the defensive, get\r\nyour force in order, and give such protection as you can to the valley of\r\nthe Shenandoah and to western Virginia.\r\n\r\nHave you received the orders, and will you act upon them?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL C. SCHURZ.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, June 16, 1862\r\n\r\nBRIGADIER-GENERAL SCHURZ, Mount Jackson, Virginia:\r\n\r\nYour long letter is received. The information you give is valuable. You\r\nsay it is fortunate that Fremont did not intercept Jackson; that Jackson\r\nhad the superior force, and would have overwhelmed him. If this is so, how\r\nhappened it that Fremont fairly fought and routed him on the 8th? Or is\r\nthe account that he did fight and rout him false and fabricated? Both\r\nGeneral Fremont and you speak of Jackson having beaten Shields. By our\r\naccounts he did not beat Shields. He had no engagement with Shields. He\r\ndid meet and drive back with disaster about 2000 of Shields's advance till\r\nthey were met by an additional brigade of Shields's, when Jackson himself\r\nturned and retreated. Shields himself and more than half his force were\r\nnot nearer than twenty miles to any of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, June 18, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Corinth, Mississippi:\r\n\r\nIt would be of both interest and value to us here to know how the\r\nexpedition toward East Tennessee is progressing, if in your judgment you\r\ncan give us the information with safety.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., June 18, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nYours of to-day, making it probable that Jackson has been reinforced by\r\nabout 10,000 from Richmond, is corroborated by a despatch from General\r\nKing at Fredericksburg, saying a Frenchman, just arrived from Richmond by\r\nway of Gordonsville, met 10,000 to 15,000 passing through the latter place\r\nto join Jackson.\r\n\r\nIf this is true, it is as good as a reinforcement to you of an equal\r\nforce. I could better dispose of things if I could know about what day you\r\ncan attack Richmond, and would be glad to be informed, if you think you\r\ncan inform me with safety.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, JUNE 19, 1862\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nYours of last night just received, and for which I thank you.\r\n\r\nIf large reinforcements are going from Richmond to Jackson, it proves one\r\nof two things: either they are very strong at Richmond, or do not mean to\r\ndefend the place desperately.\r\n\r\nOn reflection, I do not see how reinforcements from Richmond to Jackson\r\ncould be in Gordonsville, as reported by the Frenchman and your deserters.\r\nHave not all been sent to deceive?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, June 20, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nIn regard to the contemplated execution of Captains Spriggs and Triplett\r\nthe government has no information whatever, but will inquire and advise\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, June 20, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nWe have this morning sent you a despatch of General Sigel corroborative of\r\nthe proposition that Jackson is being reinforced from Richmond. This\r\nmay be reality, and yet may only be contrivance for deception, and to\r\ndetermine which is perplexing. If we knew it was not true, we could send\r\nyou some more force; but as the case stands we do not think we safely can.\r\nStill, we will watch the signs and do so if possible.\r\n\r\nIn regard to a contemplated execution of Captains Spriggs and Triplett the\r\ngovernment has no information whatever, but will inquire and advise you.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, June 21 1862 6 PM.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL GEORGE B. McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nYour despatch of yesterday (2 P. M.) was received this morning. If it\r\nwould not divert too much of your time and attention from the army under\r\nyour immediate command, I would be glad to have your views as to the\r\npresent state of military affairs throughout the whole country, as you say\r\nyou would be glad to give them. I would rather it should be by letter than\r\nby telegraph, because of the better chance of secrecy. As to the numbers\r\nand positions of the troops not under your command in Virginia and\r\nelsewhere, even if I could do it with accuracy, which I cannot, I would\r\nrather not transmit either by telegraph or by letter, because of the\r\nchances of its reaching the enemy. I would be very glad to talk with you,\r\nbut you cannot leave your camp, and I cannot well leave here.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN, President\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL N. P. BANKS.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, June 22, 1862\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BANKS, Middletown:\r\n\r\nI am very glad you are looking well to the west for a movement of the\r\nenemy in that direction. You know my anxiety on that point.\r\n\r\nAll was quiet at General McClellan's headquarters at two o'clock to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATY WITH MEXICO\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE SENATE.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, June 23, 1862.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nOn the 7th day of December, 1861, I submitted to the Senate the project of\r\na treaty between the United States and Mexico which had been proposed to\r\nme by Mr. Corwin, our minister to Mexico, and respectfully requested the\r\nadvice of the Senate thereupon.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th day of February last a resolution was adopted by the Senate to\r\nthe effect:\r\n\r\n\"That it is not advisable to negotiate a treaty that will require the\r\nUnited States to assume any portion of the principal or interest of the\r\ndebt of Mexico, or that will require the concurrence of European powers.\"\r\n\r\nThis resolution having been duly communicated to me, notice thereof was\r\nimmediately given by the Secretary of State to Mr. Corwin, and he was\r\ninformed that he was to consider his instructions upon the subject\r\nreferred to modified by this resolution and would govern his course\r\naccordingly. That despatch failed to reach Mr. Corwin, by reason of the\r\ndisturbed condition of Mexico, until a very recent date, Mr. Corwin being\r\nwithout instructions, or thus practically left without instructions, to\r\nnegotiate further with Mexico.\r\n\r\nIn view of the very important events Occurring there, he has thought that\r\nthe interests of the United States would be promoted by the conclusion\r\nof two treaties which should provide for a loan to that republic. He has\r\ntherefore signed such treaties, and they having been duly ratified by the\r\nGovernment of Mexico, he has transmitted them to me for my consideration.\r\nThe action of the Senate is of course conclusive against an acceptance\r\nof the treaties On my part. I have, nevertheless, thought it just to our\r\nexcellent minister in Mexico and respectful to the Government of that\r\nrepublic to lay the treaties before the Senate, together with the\r\ncorrespondence which has occurred in relation to them. In performing this\r\nduty I have only to add that the importance of the subject thus submitted\r\nto the Senate, can not be over estimated, and I shall cheerfully receive\r\nand consider with the highest respect any further advice the Senate may\r\nthink proper to give upon the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO OF A CURRENCY BILL\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE SENATE, JUNE 23, 1862.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nThe bill which has passed the House of Representatives and the Senate,\r\nentitled \"An act to repeal that part of an act of Congress which prohibits\r\nthe circulation of bank-notes of a less denomination than five dollars in\r\nthe District of Columbia,\" has received my attentive consideration, and\r\nI now return it to the Senate, in which it originated, with the following\r\nobjections:\r\n\r\n1. The bill proposes to repeal the existing legislation prohibiting the\r\ncirculation of bank-notes of a less denomination than five dollars within\r\nthe District of Columbia, without permitting the issuing of such bills by\r\nbanks not now legally authorized to issue them. In my judgment, it will\r\nbe found impracticable, in the present condition of the currency, to make\r\nsuch a discrimination. The banks have generally suspended specie payments,\r\nand a legal sanction given to the circulation of the irredeemable notes\r\nof one class of them will almost certainly be so extended, in practical\r\noperation, as to include those of all classes, whether authorized or\r\nunauthorized. If this view be correct, the currency of the District,\r\nshould this act become a law, will certainly and greatly deteriorate, to\r\nthe serious injury of honest trade and honest labor.\r\n\r\n2. This bill seems to contemplate no end which cannot be otherwise\r\nmore certainly and beneficially attained. During the existing war it is\r\npeculiarly the duty of the National Government to secure to the people\r\na sound circulating medium. This duty has been, under existing\r\ncircumstances, satisfactorily performed, in part at least, by authorizing\r\nthe issue of United States notes, receivable for all government dues\r\nexcept customs, and made a legal tender for all debts, public and private,\r\nexcept interest on public debt. The object of the bill submitted to\r\nme--namely, that of providing a small note currency during the present\r\nsuspension--can be fully accomplished by authorizing the issue, as part\r\nof any new emission of United States notes made necessary by the\r\ncircumstances of the country, of notes of a similar character, but of\r\nless denomination than five dollars. Such an issue would answer all the\r\nbeneficial purposes of the bill, would save a considerable amount to the\r\ntreasury in interest, would greatly facilitate payments to soldiers and\r\nother creditors of small sums, and would furnish; to the people a currency\r\nas safe as their own government.\r\n\r\nEntertaining these objections to the bill, I feel myself constrained to\r\nwithhold from it my approval and return it for the further consideration\r\nand action of Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH AT JERSEY CITY, JUNE 24, 1862.\r\n\r\nWhen birds and animals are looked at through a fog, they are seen to\r\ndisadvantage, and so it might be with you if I were to attempt to tell\r\nyou why I went to see General Scott. I can only say that my visit to West\r\nPoint did not have the importance which has been attached to it; but it\r\nconcerned matters that you understand quite as well as if I were to tell\r\nyou all about them. Now, I can only remark that it had nothing whatever\r\nto do with making or unmaking any general in the country. The Secretary of\r\nWar, you know, holds a pretty tight rein on the press, so that they shall\r\nnot tell more than they ought to; and I 'm afraid that if I blab too much,\r\nhe might draw a tight rein on me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, June 26, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nYour three despatches of yesterday in relation to the affair, ending with\r\nthe statement that you completely succeeded in making your point, are very\r\ngratifying.\r\n\r\nThe later one of 6.15 P.M., suggesting the probability of your\r\nbeing overwhelmed by two hundred thousand, and talking of where the\r\nresponsibility will belong, pains me very much. I give you all I can, and\r\nact on the presumption that you will do the best you can with what you\r\nhave, while you continue, ungenerously I think, to assume that I could\r\ngive you more if I would. I have omitted, and shall omit, no opportunity\r\nto send you reinforcements whenever I possibly can.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nP. S. General Pope thinks if you fall back it would be much better towards\r\nYork River than towards the James. As Pope now has charge of the capital,\r\nplease confer with him through the telegraph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER CONSTITUTING THE ARMY OF VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., June 26, 1862.\r\n\r\nOrdered: 1st. The forces under Major-Generals Fremont, Banks, and\r\nMcDowell, including the troops now under Brigadier-General Sturgis at\r\nWashington, shall be consolidated and form one army, to be called the Army\r\nof Virginia.\r\n\r\n2d. The command of the Army of Virginia is specially assigned to\r\nMajor-General John Pope, as commanding general. The troops of the Mountain\r\nDepartment, heretofore under command of General Fremont, shall constitute\r\nthe First Army Corps, under the command of General Fremont; the troops of\r\nthe Shenandoah Department, now under General Banks, shall constitute the\r\nSecond Army Corps, and be commanded by him; the troops under the command\r\nof General McDowell, except those within the fortifications and city of\r\nWashington, shall form the Third Army Corps, and be under his command.\r\n\r\n3d. The Army of Virginia shall operate in such manner as, while protecting\r\nwestern Virginia and the national capital from danger or insult, it shall\r\nin the speediest manner attack and overcome the rebel forces under Jackson\r\nand Ewell, threaten the enemy in the direction of Charlottesville, and\r\nrender the most effective aid to relieve General McClellan and capture\r\nRichmond.\r\n\r\n4th. When the Army of the Potomac and the Army of Virginia shall be in\r\nposition to communicate and directly co-operate at or before Richmond, the\r\nchief command, while so operating together, shall be governed, as in like\r\ncases, by the Rules and Articles of War.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM FROM SECRETARY STANTON TO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, June 28, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK:\r\n\r\nThe enemy have concentrated in such force at Richmond as to render it\r\nabsolutely necessary, in the opinion of the President, for you immediately\r\nto detach 25,000 of your force and forward it by the nearest and quickest\r\nroute by way of Baltimore and Washington to Richmond. It is believed\r\nthat the quickest route would be by way of Columbus, Ky., and up the Ohio\r\nRiver. But in detaching your force the President directs that it be done\r\nin such a way as to enable you to hold your ground and not interfere with\r\nthe movement against Chattanooga and East Tennessee. This condition being\r\nobserved, the forces to be detached and the routes they are to be sent are\r\nleft to your own judgment.\r\n\r\nThe direction to send these forces immediately is rendered imperative by\r\na serious reverse suffered by General McClellan before Richmond yesterday,\r\nthe full extent of which is not yet known.\r\n\r\nYou will acknowledge the receipt of this despatch, stating the day and\r\nhour it is received, and inform me what your action will be, so that we\r\nmay take measures to aid in river and railroad transportation.\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAMS TO GENERAL A. E. BURNSIDE.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, June 28, 1862.\r\n\r\nGENERAL BURNSIDE:\r\n\r\nI think you had better go, with any reinforcements you can spare, to\r\nGeneral McClellan.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, June, 28, 1862\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BURNSIDE, Newbern:\r\n\r\nWe have intelligence that General McClellan has been attacked in large\r\nforce and compelled to fall back toward the James River. We are not\r\nadvised of his exact condition, but the President directs that you shall\r\nsend him all the reinforcements from your command to the James River that\r\nyou can safely do without abandoning your own position. Let it be infantry\r\nentirely, as he said yesterday that he had cavalry enough.\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON,\r\n\r\nSecretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, June 28, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nSave your army, at all events. Will send reinforcements as fast as we can.\r\nOf course they cannot reach you to-day, to-morrow, or next day. I have not\r\nsaid you were ungenerous for saying you needed reinforcements. I thought\r\nyou were ungenerous in assuming that I did not send them as fast as I\r\ncould. I feel any misfortune to you and your army quite as keenly as you\r\nfeel it yourself. If you have had a drawn battle, or a repulse, it is\r\nthe price we pay for the enemy not being in Washington. We protected\r\nWashington, and the enemy concentrated on you. Had we stripped Washington,\r\nhe would have been upon us before the troops could have gotten to you.\r\nLess than a week ago you notified us that reinforcements were leaving\r\nRichmond to come in front of us. It is the nature of the case, and neither\r\nyou nor the government is to blame. Please tell at once the present\r\ncondition and aspect of things.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY SEWARD.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, June 28, 1862\r\n\r\nHON. W. H. SEWARD.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--My view of the present condition of the war is about as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nThe evacuation of Corinth and our delay by the flood in the Chickahominy\r\nhave enabled the enemy to concentrate too much force in Richmond\r\nfor McClellan to successfully attack. In fact there soon will be no\r\nsubstantial rebel force anywhere else. But if we send all the force from\r\nhere to McClellan, the enemy will, before we can know of it, send a force\r\nfrom Richmond and take Washington. Or if a large part of the western army\r\nbe brought here to McClellan, they will let us have Richmond, and retake\r\nTennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, etc. What should be done is to hold what\r\nwe have in the West, open the Mississippi, and take Chattanooga and East\r\nTennessee without more. A reasonable force should in every event be\r\nkept about Washington for its protection. Then let the country give us a\r\nhundred thousand new troops in the shortest possible time, which, added to\r\nMcClellan directly or indirectly, will take Richmond without endangering\r\nany other place which we now hold, and will substantially end the war.\r\nI expect to maintain this contest until successful, or till I die, or am\r\nconquered, or my term expires, or Congress or the country forsake me; and\r\nI would publicly appeal to the country for this new force were it not that\r\nI fear a general panic and stampede would follow, so hard it is to have a\r\nthing understood as it really is. I think the new force should be all, or\r\nnearly all, infantry, principally because such can be raised most cheaply\r\nand quickly.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. A. DIX.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.C., June 28,1862.\r\n\r\nGENERAL DIX:\r\n\r\nCommunication with McClellan by White House is cut off. Strain every nerve\r\nto open communication with him by James River, or any other way you can.\r\nReport to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO FLAG-OFFICER L. M. GOLDSBOROUGH.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., June 28, 1862.\r\n\r\nFLAG-OFFICER GOLDS BOROUGH, Fort Monroe:\r\n\r\nEnemy has cut McClellan's communication with White House, and is driving\r\nStoneman back on that point. Do what you can for him with gunboats at or\r\nnear that place. McClellan's main force is between the Chickahominy and\r\nthe James. Also do what you can to communicate with him and support him\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo GOVERNOR MORTON.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.C. June 28, 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR O. P. MORTON, Indianapolis, Ind:\r\n\r\nYour despatch of to-day is just received. I have no recollection of either\r\nJohn R. Cravens or Cyrus M. Allen having been named to me for appointment\r\nunder the tax law. The latter particularly has been my friend, and I am\r\nsorry to learn that he is not yours. No appointment has been or will be\r\nmade by me for the purpose of stabbing you.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO SECRETARY SEWARD.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, June 29, 1862.6 P.M.\r\n\r\nHON. WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Astor House, New York:\r\n\r\nNot much more than when you left. Fulton of Baltimore American is now with\r\nus. He left White House at 11 A.M. yesterday. He conversed fully with a\r\npaymaster who was with Porter's force during the fight of Friday and fell\r\nback to nearer McClellan's quarters just a little sooner than Porter did,\r\nseeing the whole of it; stayed on the Richmond side of the Chickahominy\r\nover night, and left for White House at 5 A.M. Saturday. He says Porter\r\nretired in perfect order under protection of the guns arranged for the\r\npurpose, under orders and not from necessity; and with all other of our\r\nforces, except what was left on purpose to go to White House, was safely\r\nin pontoons over the Chickahominy before morning, and that there was heavy\r\nfiring on the Richmond side, begun at 5 and ceased at 7 A.M. Saturday. On\r\nthe whole, I think we have had the better of it up to that point of time.\r\nWhat has happened since we still know not, as we have no communication\r\nwith General McClellan. A despatch from Colonel Ingalls shows that he\r\nthinks McClellan is fighting with the enemy at Richmond to-day, and will\r\nbe to-morrow. We have no means of knowing upon what Colonel Ingalls founds\r\nhis opinion. Confirmed about saving all property. Not a single unwounded\r\nstraggler came back to White House from the field, and the number of\r\nwounded reaching there up to 11 A.M. Saturday was not large.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo what the President has above stated I will only add one or two points\r\nthat may be satisfactory for you to know.\r\n\r\nFirst. All the sick and wounded were safely removed\r\n\r\nSecond. A despatch from Burnside shows that he is from White House; not a\r\nman left behind in condition to afford efficient support, and is probably\r\ndoing so.\r\n\r\nThird. The despatch from Colonel Ingalls impresses me with the conviction\r\nthat the movement was made by General McClellan to concentrate on\r\nRichmond, and was successful to the latest point of which we have any\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nFourth. Mr. Fulton says that on Friday night, between twelve and one\r\no'clock, General McClellan telegraphed Commodore Goldsborough that the\r\nresult of the movement was satisfactory to him.\r\n\r\nFifth. From these and the facts stated by the President, my inference is\r\nthat General McClellan will probably be in Richmond within two days.\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n[Unfortunately McClellan did not do any of the things he was ordered, and\r\nthat it was very likely possible to do. It is still some mystery what he\r\nwas doing all these days other than hiding in the woods and staying out of\r\ncommunication so he would not receive any more uncomfortable orders. This\r\nwas another place where the North was close to wining the war and did not.\r\nD.W.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO SECRETARY SEWARD. WAR DEPARTMENT, June 30, 1862.\r\n\r\nHON. WM. H. SEWARD, New York:\r\n\r\nWe are yet without communication with General McClellan, and this absence\r\nof news is our point of anxiety. Up to the latest point to which we are\r\nposted he effected everything in such exact accordance with his plan,\r\ncontingently announced to us before the battle began, that we feel\r\njustified to hope that he has not failed since. He had a severe engagement\r\nin getting the part of his army on this side of the Chickahominy over to\r\nthe other side, in which the enemy lost certainly as much as we did. We\r\nare not dissatisfied with this, only that the loss of enemies does not\r\ncompensate for the loss of friends. The enemy cannot come below White\r\nHouse; certainly is not there now, and probably has abandoned the whole\r\nline. Dix's pickets are at New Kent Court-House.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCALL FOR TROOPS. NEW YORK, June 30, 1862.\r\n\r\nTO THE GOVERNORS OF THE SEVERAL STATES:\r\n\r\nThe capture of New Orleans, Norfolk, and Corinth by the national forces\r\nhas enabled the insurgents to concentrate a large force at and about\r\nRichmond, which place we must take with the least possible delay; in fact,\r\nthere will soon be no formidable insurgent force except at Richmond.\r\nWith so large an army there, the enemy can threaten us on the Potomac and\r\nelsewhere. Until we have re-established the national authority, all these\r\nplaces must be held, and we must keep a respectable force in front of\r\nWASHINGTON. But this, from the diminished strength of our army by sickness\r\nand casualties, renders an addition to it necessary in order to close the\r\nstruggle which has been prosecuted for the last three months with energy\r\nand success. Rather than hazard the misapprehension of our military\r\ncondition and of groundless alarm by a call for troops by proclamation, I\r\nhave deemed it best to address you in this form. To accomplish the object\r\nstated we require without delay 150,000 men, including those recently\r\ncalled for by the Secretary of War. Thus reinforced our gallant army will\r\nbe enabled to realize the hopes and expectations of the government and the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. A. DIX.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, June 30, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL Dix, Fort Monroe:\r\n\r\nIs it not probable that the enemy has abandoned the line between White\r\nHouse and McClellan's rear? He could have but little object to maintain\r\nit, and nothing to subsist upon. Would not Stoneman better move up and\r\nsee about it? I think a telegraphic communication can at once be opened to\r\nWhite House from Williamsburg. The wires must be up still.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAMS TO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, JUNE 30, 1862. 3 P. M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Corinth:\r\n\r\nYour telegram of this date just received. The Chattanooga expedition\r\nmust not on any account be given up. The President regards that and the\r\nmovement against East Tennessee as one of the most important movements\r\nof the war, and its occupation nearly as important as the capture of\r\nRichmond. He is not pleased with the tardiness of the movement toward\r\nChattanooga, and directs that no force be sent here if you cannot do it\r\nwithout breaking up the operations against that point and East Tennessee.\r\nInfantry only are needed; our cavalry and artillery are strong enough.\r\nThe first reports from Richmond were more discouraging than the truth\r\nwarranted. If the advantage is not on our side, it is balanced. General\r\nMcClellan has moved his whole force on the line of the James River, and\r\nis supported there by our gunboats; but he must be largely strengthened\r\nbefore advancing, and hence the call on you, which I am glad you answered\r\nso promptly. Let me know to what point on the river you will send your\r\nforces, so as to provide immediately for transportation.\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON,\r\n\r\nSecretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., June 30, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Corinth, Mississippi:\r\n\r\nWould be very glad of 25,000 infantry; no artillery or cavalry; but please\r\ndo not send a man if it endangers any place you deem important to hold,\r\nor if it forces you to give up or weaken or delay the expedition against\r\nChattanooga. To take and hold the railroad at or east of Cleveland, in\r\nEast Tennessee, I think fully as important as the taking and holding of\r\nRichmond.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCALL FOR 300,000 VOLUNTEERS, JULY 1, 1862.\r\n\r\nJune 28, 1861.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, governors of States of the Union, impressed with the\r\nbelief that the citizens of the States which they respectively represent\r\nare of one accord in the hearty desire that the recent successes of the\r\nFederal arms may be followed up by measures which must insure the speedy\r\nrestoration of the Union, and believing that, in view of the present\r\nstate of the important military movements now in progress, and the reduced\r\ncondition of our effective forces in the field, resulting from the usual\r\nand unavoidable casualties in the service, the time has arrived for prompt\r\nand vigorous measures to be adopted by the people in support of the great\r\ninterests committed to your charge, respectfully request, if it meets with\r\nyour entire approval, that you at once call upon the several States\r\nfor such number of men as may be required to fill up all military\r\norganizations now in the field, and add to the armies heretofore organized\r\nsuch additional number of men as may, in your judgment, be necessary to\r\ngarrison and hold all the numerous cities and military positions that\r\nhave been captured by our armies, and to speedily crush the rebellion that\r\nstill exists in several of the Southern States, thus practically restoring\r\nto the civilized world our great and good government. All believe that the\r\ndecisive moment is near at hand, and to that end the people of the United\r\nStates are desirous to aid promptly in furnishing all reinforcements that\r\nyou may deem needful to sustain our government.\r\n\r\n     ISRAEL WASHBURN, JR., Governor of Maine.\r\n     H. S. BERRY, Governor of New Hampshire.\r\n     FREDERICK HOLBROOK, Governor of Vermont.\r\n     WILLIAM A. BUCKINGHAM, Governor of Connecticut.\r\n     E. D.

I suggest and recommend that the troops should be chiefly\r\nof infantry. The quota of your State would be ------. I trust that\r\nthey may be enrolled without delay, so as to bring this unnecessary and\r\ninjurious civil war to a speedy and satisfactory conclusion. An order\r\nfixing the quotas of the respective States will be issued by the War\r\nDepartment to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION CONCERNING TAXES IN REBELLIOUS STATES, JULY 1, 1862.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nWhereas in and by the second section of an act of Congress passed on the\r\n7th day of June, A. D. 1862, entitled \"An act for the collection of direct\r\ntaxes in insurrectionary districts within the United States, and for other\r\npurposes,\" it is made the duty of the President to declare, on or before\r\nthe first day of July then next following, by his proclamation, in what\r\nStates and parts of States insurrection exists:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the\r\nUnited States of America, do hereby declare and proclaim that the\r\nStates of South Carolina, Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, Texas,\r\nMississippi, Arkansas, Tennessee, North Carolina, and the State of\r\nVirginia except the following counties-Hancock, Brooke, Ohio, Marshall,\r\nWetzel, Marion, Monongalia, Preston, Taylor, Pleasants, Tyler, Ritchie,\r\nDoddridge, Harrison, Wood, Jackson, Wirt, Roane, Calhoun, Gilmer, Barbour,\r\nTucker, Lewis, Braxton, Upsbur, Randolph, Mason, Putnam, Kanawha, Clay,\r\nNicholas, Cabell, Wayne, Boone, Logan, Wyoming, Webster, Fayette, and\r\nRaleigh-are now in insurrection and rebellion, and by reason thereof the\r\ncivil authority of the United States is obstructed so that the provisions\r\nof the \"Act to provide increased revenue from imports, to pay the interest\r\non the public debt, and for other purposes,\" approved August 5, 1861, can\r\nnot be peaceably executed; and that the taxes legally chargeable upon real\r\nestate under the act last aforesaid lying within the States and parts\r\nof States as aforesaid, together with a penalty of 50 per centum of said\r\ntaxes, shall be a lien upon the tracts or lots of the same, severally\r\ncharged, till paid.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the\r\nUnited States to be affixed..............\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:  F. W. SEWARD, Acting Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS, JULY 1, 1862.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\r\n\r\nI most cordially recommend that Captain Andrew H. Foote, of the United\r\nStates Navy, receive a vote of thanks of Congress for his eminent services\r\nin Organizing the flotilla on the western Waters, and for his gallantry at\r\nFort Henry, Fort Donelson, Island Number Ten, and at various other places,\r\nwhilst in command of the naval forces, embracing a period of nearly ten\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C. July 1, 1862\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, JULY 1,1862. 3.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL GEORGE B. McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to reinforce you for your present emergency. If we had a\r\nmillion of men, We could not get them to you in time. We have not the men\r\nto send. If you are not strong enough to face the enemy, you must find a\r\nplace of security, and wait, rest, and repair. Maintain your ground if\r\nyou can, but save the army at all events, even if you fall back to Fort\r\nMonroe. We still have strength enough in the country, and will bring it\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.C., July 2, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nYour despatch of Tuesday morning induces me to hope your army is having\r\nsome rest. In this hope allow me to reason with you a moment. When you ask\r\nfor 50,000 men to be promptly sent you, you surely labor under some gross\r\nmistake of fact. Recently you sent papers showing your disposal of forces\r\nmade last spring for the defense of WASHINGTON, and advising a return to\r\nthat plan. I find it included in and about WASHINGTON 75,000 men. Now,\r\nplease be assured I have not men enough to fill that very plan by 15,000.\r\nAll of Fremont's in the valley, all of Banks's, all of McDowell's not with\r\nyou, and all in WASHINGTON, taken together, do not exceed, if they reach,\r\n60,000. With Wool and Dix added to those mentioned, I have not, outside of\r\nyour army, 75,000 men east of the mountains. Thus the idea of sending you\r\n50,000, or any other considerable force, promptly, is simply absurd. If,\r\nin your frequent mention of responsibility, you have the impression that\r\nI blame you for not doing more than you can, please be relieved of\r\nsuch impression. I only beg that in like manner you will not ask\r\nimpossibilities of me. If you think you are not strong enough to take\r\nRichmond just now, I do not ask you to try just now. Save the army,\r\nmaterial and personal, and I will strengthen it for the offensive again\r\nas fast as I can. The governors of eighteen States offer me a new levy of\r\n300,000, which I accept.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C. July 2, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Corinth, Mississippi:\r\n\r\nYour several despatches of yesterday to Secretary of War and myself\r\nreceived. I did say, and now repeat, I would be exceedingly glad for some\r\nreinforcements from you. Still do not send a man if in your judgment it\r\nwill endanger any point you deem important to hold, or will force you to\r\ngive up or weaken or delay the Chattanooga expedition.\r\n\r\nPlease tell me could you not make me a flying visit for consultation\r\nwithout endangering the Service in your department.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE SENATE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, July 2, 1862.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nI herewith return to your honorable body, in which it originated, an\r\nact entitled \"An act to provide for additional medical officers of the\r\nvolunteer service,\" without my approval.\r\n\r\nMy reason for so doing is that I have approved an act of the same title\r\npassed by Congress after the passage of the one first mentioned for the\r\nexpress purpose of correcting errors in and superseding the same, as I am\r\ninformed.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCIRCULAR LETTER TO THE GOVERNORS.\r\n\r\n(Private and Confidential.)\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, July 3, 1862.10.30 A.M.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR WASHBURN, Maine [and other governors] I should not want the half\r\nof 300,000 new troops if I could have them now. If I had 50,000 additional\r\ntroops here now, I believe I could substantially close the war in two\r\nweeks. But time is everything, and if I get 50,000 new men in a month, I\r\nshall have lost 20,000 old ones during the same month, having gained only\r\n30,000, with the difference between old and new troops still against me.\r\nThe quicker you send, the fewer you will have to send. Time is everything.\r\nPlease act in view of this. The enemy having given up Corinth, it is not\r\nwonderful that he is thereby enabled to check us for a time at Richmond.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT WASHINGTON, D.C., JULY 3, 1862\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL GEORGE B. McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nYours of 5.30 yesterday is just received. I am satisfied that yourself,\r\nofficers, and men have done the best you could. All accounts say better\r\nfighting was never done. Ten thousand thanks for it.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th we sent General Burnside an order to send all the force he\r\ncould spare to you. We then learned that you had requested him to go to\r\nGoldsborough; upon which we said to him our order was intended for your\r\nbenefit, and we did not wish to be in conflict with your views.\r\n\r\nWe hope you will have help from him soon. Today we have ordered General\r\nHunter to send you all he can spare. At last advices General Halleck\r\nthinks he cannot send reinforcements without endangering all he has\r\ngained.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN, President\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, D.C., July 4, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nI understand your position as stated in your letter and by General Marcy.\r\nTo reinforce you so as to enable you to resume the offensive within a\r\nmonth, or even six weeks, is impossible. In addition to that arrived and\r\nnow arriving from the Potomac (about 10,000 men, I suppose), and about\r\n10,000 I hope you will have from Burnside very soon, and about 5000 from\r\nHunter a little later, I do not see how I can send you another man within\r\na month. Under these circumstances the defensive for the present must be\r\nyour only care. Save the army first, where you are, if you can; secondly,\r\nby removal, if you must. You, on the ground, must be the judge as to which\r\nyou will attempt, and of the means for effecting it. I but give it as my\r\nopinion that with the aid of the gunboats and the reinforcements mentioned\r\nabove you can hold your present position--provided, and so long as,\r\nyou can keep the James River open below you. If you are not tolerably\r\nconfident you can keep the James River open, you had better remove as soon\r\nas possible. I do not remember that you have expressed any apprehension as\r\nto the danger of having your communication cut on the river below you, yet\r\nI do not suppose it can have escaped your attention.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--If at any time you feel able to take the offensive, you are not\r\nrestrained from doing so. A.L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, July 4, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Corinth, Mississippi:\r\n\r\nYou do not know how much you would oblige us if, without abandoning any of\r\nyour positions or plans, you could promptly send us even 10,000 infantry.\r\nCan you not? Some part of the Corinth army is certainly fighting McClellan\r\nin front of Richmond. Prisoners are in our hands from the late Corinth\r\narmy.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. A. DIX.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, July 4,1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL Dix, Fort Monroe:\r\n\r\nSend forward the despatch to Colonel Hawkins and this also. Our order and\r\nGeneral McClellan's to General Burnside being the same, of course we wish\r\nit executed as promptly as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, July 5, 1862. 9 A.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL GEORGE B. McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nA thousand thanks for the relief your two despatches of 12 and 1 P.M.\r\nyesterday gave me. Be assured the heroism and skill of yourself and\r\nofficers and men is, and forever will be, appreciated.\r\n\r\nIf you can hold your present position, we shall have the enemy yet.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, D.C., July 6, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Corinth, Mississippi.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--This introduces Governor William Sprague, of Rhode Island.\r\nHe is now Governor for the third time, and senator-elect of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nI know the object of his visit to you. He has my cheerful consent to go,\r\nbut not my direction. He wishes to get you and part of your force, one or\r\nboth, to come here. You already know I should be exceedingly glad of\r\nthis if, in your judgment, it could be without endangering positions and\r\noperations in the southwest; and I now repeat what I have more than once\r\nsaid by telegraph: \"Do not come or send a man if, in your judgment, it\r\nwill endanger any point you deem important to hold, or endangers or delays\r\nthe Chattanooga expedition.\"\r\n\r\nStill, please give my friend, Governor Sprague, a full and fair hearing.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM OF AN INTERVIEW BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND GENERAL McCLELLAN\r\n\r\nAND OTHER OFFICERS DURING A VISIT TO THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC AT HARRISON'S\r\nLANDING, VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\nJuly 9, 1862.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: What amount of force have you now?\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL McCLELLAN: About 80,000, can't vary much, certainly 75,000.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT:[to the corps commanders] What is the whole amount of your\r\ncorps with you now.\r\n\r\n     GENERAL SUMNER: About 15,000.\r\n     GENERAL HEINTZELMAN: 15,000 for duty.\r\n     GENERAL KEYES: About 12,500.\r\n     GENERAL PORTER: About 23,000--fully 20,000 fit for duty.\r\n     GENERAL FRANKLIN: About 15,000.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: What is likely to be your condition as to health in this\r\ncamp?\r\n\r\nGENERAL McCLELLAN: Better than in any encampment since landing at Fortress\r\nMonroe.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT LINCOLN:[to the corps commanders] In your present encampment\r\nwhat is the present and prospective condition as to health?\r\n\r\nGENERAL SUMNER: As good as any part of Western Virginia.\r\n\r\nGENERAL HEINTZELMAN: Excellent for health, and present health improving.\r\n\r\nGENERAL KEYES: A little improved, but think camp is getting worse.\r\n\r\nGENERAL PORTER: Very good.\r\n\r\nGENERAL FRANKLIN: Not good.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Where is the enemy now?\r\n\r\nGENERAL McCLELLAN: From four to five miles from us on all the roads--I\r\nthink nearly the whole army--both Hills, Longstreet, Jackson, Magruder,\r\nHuger.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: [to the corps commanders] Where and in what condition do\r\nyou believe the enemy to be now?\r\n\r\nGENERAL SUMNER: I think they have retired from our front; were very\r\nmuch damaged, especially in their best troops, in the late actions, from\r\nsuperiority of arms.\r\n\r\nGENERAL HEINTZELMAN: Don't think they are in force in our vicinity.\r\n\r\nGENERAL KEYES: Think he has withdrawn, and think preparing to go to\r\nWASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nGENERAL PORTER: Believe he is mainly near Richmond. He feels he dare not\r\nattack us here.\r\n\r\nGENERAL FRANKLIN: I learn he has withdrawn from our front and think that\r\nis probable.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: [to the corps commanders] What is the aggregate of your\r\nkilled, wounded, and missing from the attack on the 26th ultimo till now?\r\n\r\n     GENERAL SUMNER:   1175.\r\n     GENERAL HEINTZELMAN: Not large 745.\r\n     GENERAL KEYES: Less than 500.\r\n     GENERAL PORTER:    Over 5000.\r\n     GENERAL FRANKLIN: Not over 3000.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: If you desired could you remove the army safely?\r\n\r\nGENERAL McCLELLAN: It would be a delicate and very difficult matter.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: [to the corps commanders] If it were desired to get the\r\narmy away, could it be safely effected?\r\n\r\nGENERAL SUMNER: I think we could, but I think we give up the cause if we\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nGENERAL HEINTZELMAN: Perhaps we could, but I think it would be ruinous to\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nGENERAL KEYES: I think it could if done quickly.\r\n\r\nGENERAL PORTER: Impossible--move the army and ruin the country.\r\n\r\nGENERAL FRANKLIN: I think we could, and that we had better--think\r\nRappahannock the true line.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: [to the corps commanders] Is the army secure in its present\r\nposition?\r\n\r\n    GENERAL SUMNER: Perfectly so, in my judgment.\r\n    GENERAL HEINTZELMAN: I think it is safe.\r\n    GENERAL KEYES: With help of General B. [Burnside] can hold position.\r\n    GENERAL PORTER: Perfectly so. Not only, but we are ready to begin\r\n                    moving forward.\r\n    GENERAL FRANKLIN: Unless river can be closed it is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER MAKING HALLECK GENERAL-IN-CHIEF.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July 11,1862.\r\n\r\nOrdered, That Major-General Henry W. Halleck be assigned to command the\r\nwhole land forces of the United States, as general-in-chief, and that he\r\nrepair to this capital so soon as he can with safety to the positions and\r\noperations within the department now under his charge.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER CONCERNING THE SOUTHWEST BRANCH OF THE PACIFIC RAILROAD.\r\n\r\nWhereas, in the judgment of the President, the public safety does require\r\nthat the railroad line called and known as the Southwest Branch of the\r\nPacific Railroad in the State of Missouri be repaired, extended, and\r\ncompleted from Rolla to Lebanon, in the direction to Springfield, in the\r\nsaid State, the same being necessary to the successful and economical\r\nconduct of the war and to the maintenance of the authority of the\r\ngovernment in the Southwest:\r\n\r\nTherefore, under and in virtue of the act of Congress entitled \"An act\r\nto authorize the President of the United States in certain cases to take\r\npossession of railroad and telegraph lines, and for other purposes,\"\r\napproved January 31, 1862, it is ordered, That the portion of the said\r\nrailroad line which reaches from Rolla to Lebanon be repaired, extended,\r\nand completed, so as to be made available for the military uses of the\r\ngovernment, as speedily as may be. And, inasmuch as upon the part of the\r\nsaid line from Rolla to the stream called Little Piney a considerable\r\nportion of the necessary work has already been done by the railroad\r\ncompany, and the road to this extent may be completed at comparatively\r\nsmall cost, it is ordered that the said line from Rolla to and across\r\nLittle Piney be first completed, and as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War is charged with the execution of this order. And\r\nto facilitate the speedy execution of the work, he is directed, at his\r\ndiscretion, to take possession and control of the whole or such part of\r\nthe said railroad line, and the whole or such part of the rolling stock,\r\noffices, shops, buildings, and all their appendages and appurtenances, as\r\nhe may judge necessary or convenient for the early completion of the road\r\nfrom Rolla to Lebanon.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of WASHINGTON, July 11, 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D C., July 11, 1862\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nI recommend that the thanks of Congress be given to the following officers\r\nof the United States Navy:\r\n\r\nCaptain James L. Lardner, for meritorious conduct at the battle of Port\r\nRoyal and distinguished services on the coast of the United States against\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\nCaptain Charles Henry Davis, for distinguished services in conflict with\r\nthe enemy at Fort Pillow, at Memphis, and for successful operations at\r\nother points in the waters of the Mississippi River.\r\n\r\nCommander John A. Dahlgren, for distinguished services in the line of his\r\nprofession, improvements in ordnance, and zealous and efficient labors in\r\nthe ordnance branch of the service.\r\n\r\nCommander Stephen C. Rowan, for distinguished services in the waters of\r\nNorth Carolina, and particularly in the capture of Newbern, being in chief\r\ncommand of the naval forces.\r\n\r\nCommander David D. Porter, for distinguished services in the conception\r\nand preparation of the means used for the capture of the forts below\r\nNew Orleans, and for highly meritorious conduct in the management of the\r\nmortar flotilla during the bombardment of Forts Jackson and St. Philip.\r\n\r\nCaptain Silas H. Stringharn, now on the retired list, for distinguished\r\nservices in the capture of Forts Hatteras and Clark.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR JOHNSON. WAR DEPARTMENT, July 11, 1862.\r\n\r\nHON. ANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Yours of yesterday is received. Do you not, my good friend,\r\nperceive that what you ask is simply to put you in command in the West?\r\nI do not suppose you desire this. You only wish to control in your own\r\nlocalities; but this you must know may derange all other posts. Can\r\nyou not, and will you not, have a full conference with General Halleck?\r\nTelegraph him, and meet him at such place as he and you can agree upon. I\r\ntelegraph him to meet you and confer fully with you.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK. WAR DEPARTMENT, July 11, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Corinth:\r\n\r\nGovernor Johnson, at Nashville, is in great trouble and anxiety about a\r\nraid into Kentucky. The governor is a true and valuable man--indispensable\r\nto us in Tennessee. Will you please get in communication with him,\r\nand have a full conference with him before you leave for here? I have\r\ntelegraphed him on the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPEAL TO BORDER-STATES IN FAVOR OF COMPENSATED EMANCIPATION.\r\n\r\nJuly 12, 1862.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:--After the adjournment of Congress now very near, I shall have\r\nno opportunity of seeing you for several months. Believing that you of\r\nthe border States hold more power for good than any other equal number of\r\nmembers, I feel it a duty which I cannot justifiably waive to make this\r\nappeal to you. I intend no reproach or complaint when I assure you\r\nthat, in my opinion, if you all had voted for the resolution in the\r\ngradual-emancipation message of last March, the war would now be\r\nsubstantially ended. And the plan therein proposed is yet one of the most\r\npotent and swift means of ending it. Let the States which are in rebellion\r\nsee definitely and certainly that in no event will the States you\r\nrepresent ever join their proposed confederacy, and they cannot much\r\nlonger maintain the contest. But you cannot divest them of their hope\r\nto ultimately have you with them so long as you show a determination to\r\nperpetuate the institution within your own States. Beat them at elections,\r\nas you have overwhelmingly done, and, nothing daunted, they still claim\r\nyou as their own. You and I know what the lever of their power is. Break\r\nthat lever before their faces, and they can shake you no more forever.\r\nMost of you have treated me with kindness and consideration and I trust\r\nyou will not now think I improperly touch what is exclusively your own,\r\nwhen, for the sake of the whole country, I ask, Can you, for your States,\r\ndo better than to take the course I urge? Discarding punctilio and maxims\r\nadapted to more manageable times, and looking only to the unprecedentedly\r\nstern facts of our case, can you do better in any possible event? You\r\nprefer that the constitutional relation of the States to the nation shall\r\nbe practically restored without disturbance of the institution; and if\r\nthis were done, my whole duty in this respect, under the Constitution\r\nand my oath of office, would be performed. But it is not done, and we\r\nare trying to accomplish it by war. The incidents of the war cannot be\r\navoided. If the war continues long, as it must if the object be not sooner\r\nattained, the institution in your States will be extinguished by mere\r\nfriction and abrasion--by the mere incidents of the war. It will be gone,\r\nand you will have nothing valuable in lieu of it. Much of its value is\r\ngone already. How much better for you and for your people to take the step\r\nwhich at once shortens the war and secures substantial compensation for\r\nthat which is sure to be wholly lost in any other event! How much better\r\nto thus save the money which else we sink forever in war! How much better\r\nto do it while we can, lest the war ere long render us pecuniarily unable\r\nto do it! How much better for you as seller, and the nation as buyer, to\r\nsell out and buy out that without which the war could never have been,\r\nthan to sink both the thing to be sold and the price of it in cutting\r\none another's throats! I do not speak of emancipation at once, but of\r\na decision at once to emancipate gradually. Room in South America for\r\ncolonization can be obtained cheaply and in abundance, and when numbers\r\nshall be large enough to be company and encouragement for one another, the\r\nfreed people will not be so reluctant to go.\r\n\r\nI am pressed with a difficulty not yet mentioned--one which threatens\r\ndivision among those who, united, are none too strong. An instance of it\r\nis known to you. General Hunter is an honest man. He was, and I hope still\r\nis, my friend. I valued him none the less for his agreeing with me in the\r\ngeneral wish that all men everywhere could be free. He proclaimed all men\r\nfree within certain States, and I repudiated the proclamation. He expected\r\nmore good and less harm from the measure than I could believe would\r\nfollow. Yet, in repudiating it, I gave dissatisfaction, if not offence, to\r\nmany whose support the country cannot afford to lose. And this is not\r\nthe end of it. The pressure in this direction is still upon me, and is\r\nincreasing. By conceding what I now ask you can relieve me, and, much\r\nmore, can relieve the country in this important point.\r\n\r\nUpon these considerations, I have again begged your attention to the\r\nmessage of March last. Before leaving the Capital, consider and discuss it\r\namong yourselves. You are patriots and statesmen, and as such I pray\r\nyou consider this proposition; and, at the least, commend it to the\r\nconsideration of your States and people. As you would perpetuate popular\r\ngovernment for the best people in the world, I beseech you that you do\r\nin nowise omit this. Our common country is in great peril, demanding the\r\nloftiest views and boldest action to bring a speedy relief. Once relieved,\r\nits form of government is saved to the world; its beloved history and\r\ncherished memories are vindicated, and its happy future fully assured\r\nand rendered inconceivably grand. To you, more than to any others, the\r\nprivilege is given to assure that happiness and swell that grandeur, and\r\nto link your own names therewith forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July 13, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I am told that over 160,000 men have gone into your army\r\non the Peninsula. When I was with you the other day we made out 86,500\r\nremaining, leaving 73,500 to be accounted for. I believe 23,500 will cover\r\nall the killed, wounded, and missing in all your battles and skirmishes,\r\nleaving 50,000 who have left otherwise. No more than 5000 of these have\r\ndied, leaving 45,000 of your army still alive and not with it. I believe\r\nhalf or two-thirds of them are fit for duty to-day. Have you any more\r\nperfect knowledge of this than I have? If I am right, and you had these\r\nmen with you, you could go into Richmond in the next three days. How can\r\nthey be got to you, and how can they be prevented from getting away in\r\nsuch numbers for the future?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, July 13, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Corinth, Mississippi:\r\n\r\nThey are having a stampede in Kentucky. Please look to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. T. BOYLE.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, July 13, 1862.\r\n\r\nGENERAL J. T. BOYLE, Louisville, Kentucky:\r\n\r\nYour several despatches received. You should call on General Halleck.\r\nTelegraph him at once. I have telegraphed him that you are in trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. T. BOYLE.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, July 13, 1862.\r\n\r\nGENERAL J. T. BOYLE, Louisville, Kentucky:\r\n\r\nWe cannot venture to order troops from General Buell. We know not what\r\ncondition he is in. He maybe attacked himself. You must call on General\r\nHalleck, who commands, and whose business it is to understand and care for\r\nthe whole field If you cannot telegraph to him, send a messenger to him. A\r\ndispatch has this moment come from Halleck at Tuscombia, Alabama.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT OF COMPENSATED EMANCIPATION\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nJuly 4, 1862.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nHerewith is the draft of the bill to compensate any State which may\r\nabolish slavery within its limits, the passage of which, substantially as\r\npresented, I respectfully and earnestly recommend.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\nBe it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates of America in Congress assembled:--That whenever the President of\r\nthe United States shall be satisfied that any State shall have lawfully\r\nabolished slavery within and through-out such State, either immediately\r\nor gradually, it shall be the duty of the President, assisted by the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, to prepare and deliver to each State an amount\r\nof six per cent. interest-bearing bonds of the United States equal to the\r\naggregate value at ------ dollars per head of all the slaves within such\r\nState, as reported by the census of 1860; the whole amount for any one\r\nState to be delivered at once if the abolishment be immediate, or in equal\r\nannual instalments if it be gradual, interest to begin running on each\r\nbond at the time of delivery, and not before.\r\n\r\nAnd be it further enacted, That if any State, having so received any such\r\nbonds, shall at any time afterwards by law reintroduce or tolerate slavery\r\nwithin its limits, contrary to the act of abolishment upon which such\r\nbonds shall have been received, said bonds so received by said State shall\r\nat once be null and void, in whosesoever hands they may be, and such State\r\nshall refund to the United States all interest which may have been paid on\r\nsuch bonds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, July 14, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Corinth, Mississippi:\r\n\r\nI am very anxious--almost impatient--to have you here. Have due regard to\r\nwhat you leave behind. When can you reach here?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, July 14, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nGeneral Burnside's force is at Newport News, ready to move, on short\r\nnotice, one way or the other, when ordered.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SOLOMON FOOT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July 15, 1862.\r\n\r\nHON. SOLOMON FOOT, President pro tempore of the Senate.\r\n\r\nSIR:--Please inform the Senate that I shall be obliged if they will\r\npostpone the adjournment at least one day beyond the time which I\r\nunderstand to be now fixed for it.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n[The same message was addressed to Hon. Galusha A. Grow Speaker of the\r\nHouse of Representatives.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS. July 17, 1862.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nI have inadvertently omitted so long to inform you that in March last Mr.\r\nCornelius Vanderbilt, of New York, gratuitously presented to the United\r\nStates the ocean steamer Vanderbilt, by many esteemed the finest merchant\r\nship in the world. She has ever since been and still is doing valuable\r\nservice to the government. For the patriotic act of making this\r\nmagnificent and valuable present to the country I recommend that some\r\nsuitable acknowledgment be made.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS. July 17, 1862.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nConsidering the bill for \"An act to suppress insurrection, to punish\r\ntreason and rebellion, to seize and confiscate the property of rebels, and\r\nfor other purposes,\" and the joint resolution explanatory of said act as\r\nbeing substantially one, I have approved and signed both.\r\n\r\nBefore I was informed of the passage of the resolution I had prepared the\r\ndraft of a message stating objections to the bill becoming a law, a copy\r\nof which draft is herewith transmitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nI herewith return to your honorable body, in which it originated, the bill\r\nfor an act entitled \"An act to suppress treason and rebellion, to seize\r\nand confiscate the property of rebels, and for other purposes,\" together\r\nwith my objections to its becoming a law.\r\n\r\nThere is much in the bill to which I perceive no objection. It is wholly\r\nprospective, and touches neither person nor property of any loyal citizen,\r\nin which particulars it is just and proper. The first and second sections\r\nprovide for the conviction and punishment of persons Who shall be guilty\r\nof treason and persons who shall \"incite, set on foot, assist, or engage\r\nin any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United\r\nStates or the laws thereof, or shall give aid and comfort thereto, or\r\nshall engage in or give aid and comfort to any such existing rebellion or\r\ninsurrection.\" By fair construction persons within these sections are not\r\nto be punished without regular trials in duly constituted courts,\r\nunder the forms and all the substantial provisions of law and of the\r\nConstitution applicable to their several cases. To this I perceive\r\nno objection, especially as such persons would be within the general\r\npardoning power and also the special provision for pardon and amnesty\r\ncontained in this act.\r\n\r\nIt is also provided that the slaves of persons convicted under these\r\nsections shall be free. I think there is an unfortunate form of expression\r\nrather than a substantial objection in this. It is startling to say that\r\nCongress can free a slave within a State, and yet if it were said the\r\nownership of the slave had first been transferred to the nation and that\r\nCongress had then liberated him the difficulty would at once vanish. And\r\nthis is the real case. The traitor against the General Government forfeits\r\nhis slave at least as justly as he does any other property, and he\r\nforfeits both to the government against which be offends. The government,\r\nso far as there can be ownership, thus owns the forfeited slaves, and the\r\nquestion for Congress in regard to them is, \"Shall they be made free or\r\nbe sold to new masters?\" I perceive no objection to Congress deciding in\r\nadvance that they shall be free. To the high honor of Kentucky, as I am\r\ninformed, she is the owner of some slaves by escheat, and has sold none,\r\nbut liberated all. I hope the same is true of some other States. Indeed,\r\nI do not believe it will be physically possible for the General Government\r\nto return persons so circumstanced to actual slavery. I believe there\r\nwould be physical resistance to it which could neither be turned aside\r\nby argument nor driven away by force. In this view I have no objection to\r\nthis feature of the bill. Another matter involved in these two sections,\r\nand running through other parts of the act, will be noticed hereafter.\r\n\r\nI perceive no objection to the third or fourth sections.\r\n\r\nSo far as I wish to notice the fifth and sixth sections, they may be\r\nconsidered together. That the enforcement of these sections would do no\r\ninjustice to the persons embraced within them, is clear. That those who\r\nmake a causeless war should be compelled to pay the cost of it, is too\r\nobviously just to be called in question. To give governmental protection\r\nto the property of persons who have abandoned it, and gone on a crusade to\r\noverthrow the same government, is absurd, if considered in the mere light\r\nof justice. The severest justice may not always be the best policy.\r\nThe principle of seizing and appropriating the property of the persons\r\nembraced within these sections is certainly not very objectionable, but a\r\njustly discriminating application of it would be very difficult and, to\r\na great extent, impossible. And would it not be wise to place a power of\r\nremission somewhere, so that these persons may know they have something to\r\nlose by persisting and something to gain by desisting?\r\n\r\n[A man without hope is a most dangerous man--he has nothing to lose!]\r\n\r\nI am not sure whether such power of remission is or is not in section\r\nthirteen. Without any special act of Congress, I think our military\r\ncommanders, when--in military phrase, \"they are within the enemy's\r\ncountry,\" should, in an orderly manner, seize and use whatever of real or\r\npersonal property may be necessary or convenient for their commands; at\r\nthe same time preserving, in some way, the evidence of what they do.\r\n\r\nWhat I have said in regard to slaves, while commenting on the first and\r\nsecond sections, is applicable to the ninth, with the difference that no\r\nprovision is made in the whole act for determining whether a particular\r\nindividual slave does or does not fall within the classes defined in\r\nthat section. He is to be free upon certain conditions but whether\r\nthose conditions do or do not pertain to him no mode of ascertaining is\r\nprovided. This could be easily supplied.\r\n\r\nTo the tenth section I make no objection. The oath therein required seems\r\nto be proper, and the remainder of the section is substantially identical\r\nwith a law already existing.\r\n\r\nThe eleventh section simply assumes to confer discretionary power upon\r\nthe executive. Without the law, I have no hesitation to go as far in the\r\ndirection indicated as I may at any time deem expedient. And I am ready\r\nto say now--I think it is proper for our military commanders to employ, as\r\nlaborers, as many persons of African descent as can be used to advantage.\r\n\r\nThe twelfth and thirteenth sections are something better than\r\nunobjectionable; and the fourteenth is entirely proper, if all other parts\r\nof the act shall stand.\r\n\r\nThat to which I chiefly object pervades most parts of the act, but more\r\ndistinctly appears in the first, second, seventh, and eighth sections.\r\nIt is the sum of those provisions which results in the divesting of title\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nFor the causes of treason and ingredients of treason, not amounting to\r\nthe full crime, it declares forfeiture extending beyond the lives of the\r\nguilty parties; whereas the Constitution of the United States declares\r\nthat \"no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood or forfeiture\r\nexcept during the life of the person attainted.\" True, there is to be\r\nno formal attainder in this case; still, I think the greater punishment\r\ncannot be constitutionally inflicted, in a different form, for the same\r\noffence.\r\n\r\nWith great respect I am constrained to say I think this feature of the act\r\nis unconstitutional. It would not be difficult to modify it.\r\n\r\nI may remark that the provision of the Constitution, put in language\r\nborrowed from Great Britain, applies only in this country, as I\r\nunderstand, to real or landed estate.\r\n\r\nAgain, this act in rem forfeits property for the ingredients of treason\r\nwithout a conviction of the supposed criminal, or a personal hearing given\r\nhim in any proceeding. That we may not touch property lying within our\r\nreach, because we cannot give personal notice to an owner who is absent\r\nendeavoring to destroy the government, is certainly not satisfactory.\r\nStill, the owner may not be thus engaged; and I think a reasonable time\r\nshould be provided for such parties to appear and have personal hearings.\r\nSimilar provisions are not uncommon in connection with proceedings in rem.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons stated, I return the bill to the House in which it\r\noriginated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, D.C., July 21, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nThis is Monday. I hope to be able to tell you on Thursday what is to be\r\ndone with Burnside.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER IN REGARD TO BEHAVIOR OF ALIENS\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, July 21, 1862.\r\n\r\nThe following order has been received from the President of the United\r\nStates:\r\n\r\nRepresentations have been made to the President by the ministers of\r\nvarious foreign powers in amity with the United States that subjects of\r\nsuch powers have during the present insurrection been obliged or required\r\nby military authorities to take an oath of general or qualified allegiance\r\nto this government. It is the duty of all aliens residing in the United\r\nStates to submit to and obey the laws and respect the authority of\r\nthe government. For any proceeding or conduct inconsistent with this\r\nobligation and subversive of that authority they may rightfully be\r\nsubjected to military restraints when this may be necessary. But they\r\ncannot be required to take an oath of allegiance to this government,\r\nbecause it conflicts with the duty they owe to their own sovereigns. All\r\nsuch obligations heretofore taken are therefore remitted and annulled.\r\nMilitary commanders will abstain from imposing similar obligations in\r\nfuture, and will in lieu thereof adopt such other restraints of the\r\ncharacter indicated as they shall find necessary, convenient, and\r\neffectual for the public safety. It is further directed that whenever any\r\norder shall be made affecting the personal liberty of an alien reports of\r\nthe same and of the causes thereof shall be made to the War Department for\r\nthe consideration of the Department of State.\r\n\r\nBy order of the Secretary of War:\r\n\r\nL. THOMAS, Adjutant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER AUTHORIZING EMPLOYMENT OF \"CONTRABANDS.\"\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, July 22, 1862.\r\n\r\nOrdered:\r\n\r\n1. That military commanders within the States of Virginia, South Carolina,\r\nGeorgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, and Arkansas in\r\nan orderly manner seize and use any property, real or personal, which may\r\nbe necessary or convenient for their several commands as supplies or for\r\nother military purposes; and that while property may be destroyed for\r\nproper military objects, none shall be destroyed in wantonness or malice.\r\n\r\n2. That military and naval commanders shall employ as laborers within\r\nand from said States so many persons of African descent as can be\r\nadvantageously used for military or naval purposes, giving them reasonable\r\nwages for their labor.\r\n\r\n3. That as to both property and persons of African descent accounts shall\r\nbe kept sufficiently accurate and in detail to show quantities and amounts\r\nand from whom both property and such persons shall have come, as a basis\r\nupon which compensation can be made in proper cases; and the several\r\ndepartments of this government shall attend to and perform their\r\nappropriate parts toward the execution of these orders.\r\n\r\nBy order of the President: EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWARNING TO REBEL SYMPATHIZERS\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION, JULY 25, 1862.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the sixth section of the act of Congress entitled \"An act\r\nto suppress insurrection and to punish treason and rebellion, to seize and\r\nconfiscate property of rebels, and for other purposes,\" approved July\r\n17, 1862, and which act and the joint resolution explanatory thereof are\r\nherewith published, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do\r\nhereby proclaim to and warn all persons within the contemplation of\r\nsaid sixth section to cease participating in, aiding, countenancing, or\r\nabetting the existing rebellion or any rebellion against the Government of\r\nthe United States and to return to their proper allegiance to the United\r\nStates, on pain of the forfeitures and seizures as within and by said\r\nsixth section provided.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this twenty-fifth day of July, A.D. 1862,\r\nand of the independence of the United States the eighty-seventh.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:  WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOLD MY HAND WHILST THE ENEMY STABS ME\r\n\r\nTO REVERDY JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n(Private.)\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July 26, 1862.\r\n\r\nHON. REVERDY JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Yours of the 16th is received...........\r\n\r\nYou are ready to say I apply to friends what is due only to enemies. I\r\ndistrust the wisdom if not the sincerity of friends who would hold my\r\nhands while my enemies stab me. This appeal of professed friends has\r\nparalyzed me more in this struggle than any other one thing. You remember\r\ntelling me, the day after the Baltimore mob in April, 1861, that it would\r\ncrush all Union feeling in Maryland for me to attempt bringing troops over\r\nMaryland soil to Washington. I brought the troops notwithstanding, and\r\nyet there was Union feeling enough left to elect a Legislature the\r\nnext autumn, which in turn elected a very excellent Union United States\r\nsenator! I am a patient man--always willing to forgive on the Christian\r\nterms of repentance, and also to give ample time for repentance. Still,\r\nI must save this government, if possible. What I cannot do, of course, I\r\nwill not do; but it may as well be understood, once for all, that I shall\r\nnot surrender this game leaving any available card unplayed.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CUTHBERT BULLITT.\r\n\r\n(Private.)\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., July 28, 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUTHBERT BULLITT, Esq., New Orleans, Louisiana.\r\n\r\nSIR:--The copy of a letter addressed to yourself by Mr. Thomas J. Durant\r\nhas been shown to me. The writer appears to be an able, a dispassionate,\r\nand an entirely sincere man. The first part of the letter is devoted to\r\nan effort to show that the secession ordinance of Louisiana was adopted\r\nagainst the will of a majority of the people. This is probably true,\r\nand in that fact may be found some instruction. Why did they allow the\r\nordinance to go into effect? Why did they not assert themselves? Why stand\r\npassive and allow themselves to be trodden down by minority? Why did they\r\nnot hold popular meetings and have a convention of their own to express\r\nand enforce the true sentiment of the State? If preorganization was\r\nagainst them then, why not do this now that the United States army is\r\npresent to protect them? The paralysis--the dead palsy--of the government\r\nin this whole struggle is that this class of men will do nothing for the\r\ngovernment, nothing for themselves, except demanding that the government\r\nshall not strike its open enemies, lest they be struck by accident!\r\n\r\nMr. Durant complains that in various ways the relation of master and slave\r\nis disturbed by the presence of our army, and he considers it particularly\r\nvexatious that this, in part, is done under cover of an act of Congress,\r\nwhile constitutional guaranties are suspended on the plea of military\r\nnecessity. The truth is, that what is done and omitted about slaves\r\nis done and omitted on the same military necessity. It is a military\r\nnecessity to have men and money; and we can get neither in sufficient\r\nnumbers or amounts if we keep from or drive from our lines slaves coming\r\nto them. Mr. Durant cannot be ignorant of the pressure in this direction,\r\nnor of my efforts to hold it within bounds till he and such as he shall\r\nhave time to help themselves.\r\n\r\nI am not posted to speak understandingly on all the police regulations\r\nof which Mr. Durant complains. If experience shows any one of them to be\r\nwrong, let them be set right. I think I can perceive in the freedom\r\nof trade which Mr. Durant urges that he would relieve both friends and\r\nenemies from the pressure of the blockade. By this he would serve the\r\nenemy more effectively than the enemy is able to serve himself. I do not\r\nsay or believe that to serve the enemy is the purpose, of Mr. Durant,\r\nor that he is conscious of any purpose other than national and patriotic\r\nones. Still, if there were a class of men who, having no choice of sides\r\nin the contest, were anxious only to have quiet and comfort for themselves\r\nwhile it rages, and to fall in with the victorious side at the end of it\r\nwithout loss to themselves, their advice as to the mode of conducting\r\nthe contest would be precisely such as his is. He speaks of no\r\nduty--apparently thinks of none--resting upon Union men. He even thinks it\r\ninjurious to the Union cause that they should be restrained in trade and\r\npassage without taking sides. They are to touch neither a sail nor a pump,\r\nbut to be merely passengers--deadheads at that--to be carried snug and dry\r\nthroughout the storm, and safely landed right side up. Nay, more: even\r\na mutineer is to go untouched, lest these sacred passengers receive an\r\naccidental wound. Of course the rebellion will never be suppressed in\r\nLouisiana if the professed Union men there will neither help to do it nor\r\npermit the government to do it without their help. Now, I think the true\r\nremedy is very different from what is suggested by Mr. Durant. It does not\r\nlie in rounding the rough angles of the war, but in removing the necessity\r\nfor the war. The people of Louisiana who wish protection to person and\r\nproperty have but to reach forth their hands and take it. Let them in good\r\nfaith reinaugurate the national authority, and set up a State government\r\nconforming thereto under the Constitution. They know how to do it and can\r\nhave the protection of the army while doing it. The army will be withdrawn\r\nso soon as such State government can dispense with its presence; and the\r\npeople of the State can then, upon the old constitutional terms, govern\r\nthemselves to their own liking. This is very simple and easy.\r\n\r\nIf they will not do this--if they prefer to hazard all for the sake\r\nof destroying the government--it is for them to consider whether it is\r\nprobable I will surrender the government to save them from losing all. If\r\nthey decline what I suggest, you scarcely need to ask what I will do. What\r\nwould you do in my position? Would you drop the war where it is? Or would\r\nyou prosecute it in future with elder-stalk squirts charged with rose\r\nwater? Would you deal lighter blows rather than heavier ones? Would you\r\ngive up the contest, leaving any available means unapplied? I am in no\r\nboastful mood. I shall not do more than I can, and I shall do all I can,\r\nto save the government, which is my sworn duty as well as my personal\r\ninclination. I shall do nothing in malice. What I deal with is too vast\r\nfor malicious dealing.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO LOYAL GOVERNORS.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.C.,\r\n\r\nJuly 28, 1862.\r\n\r\nGOVERNORS OF ALL LOYAL STATES:\r\n\r\nIt would be of great service here for us to know, as fully as you can\r\ntell, what progress is made and making in recruiting for old regiments\r\nin your State. Also about what day the first regiments can move with you,\r\nwhat the second, what the third, and so on. This information is important\r\nto us in making calculations. Please give it as promptly and accurately as\r\nyou call.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBROKEN EGGS CANNOT BE MENDED\r\n\r\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER TO AUGUST BELMONT.\r\n\r\nJuly 31, 1862.\r\n\r\nBroken eggs cannot be mended; but Louisiana has nothing to do now but to\r\ntake her place in the Union as it was, barring the already broken eggs.\r\nThe sooner she does so, the smaller will be the amount of that which will\r\nbe past mending. This government cannot much longer play a game in\r\nwhich it stakes all, and its enemies stake nothing. Those enemies must\r\nunderstand that they cannot experiment for ten years trying to destroy the\r\ngovernment, and if they fail, still come back into the Union unhurt. If\r\nthey expect in any contingency to ever have the Union as it was, I join\r\nwith the writer in saying, \"Now is the time.\"\r\n\r\nHow much better it would have been for the writer to have gone at this,\r\nunder the protection of the army at New Orleans, than to have sat down in\r\na closet writing complaining letters northward!\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COUNT GASPARIN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\r\n\r\nAugust 4, 1863.\r\n\r\nTO COUNT A. DE GASPARIN.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR--Your very acceptable letter, dated Orbe, Canton de Vaud,\r\nSwitzerland, 18th of July, 1862, is received. The moral effect was the\r\nworst of the affair before Richmond, and that has run its course downward.\r\nWe are now at a stand, and shall soon be rising again, as we hope. I\r\nbelieve it is true that, in men and material, the enemy suffered more than\r\nwe in that series of conflicts, while it is certain that he is less able\r\nto bear it.\r\n\r\nWith us every soldier is a man of character, and must be treated with\r\nmore consideration than is customary in Europe. Hence our great army, for\r\nslighter causes than could have prevailed there, has dwindled rapidly,\r\nbringing the necessity for a new call earlier than was anticipated. We\r\nshall easily obtain the new levy, however. Be not alarmed if you shall\r\nlearn that we shall have resorted to a draft for part of this. It seems\r\nstrange even to me, but it is true, that the government is now pressed\r\nto this course by a popular demand. Thousands who wish not to personally\r\nenter the service are nevertheless anxious to pay and send substitutes,\r\nprovided they can have assurance that unwilling persons, similarly\r\nsituated, will be compelled to do likewise. Besides this, volunteers\r\nmostly choose to enter newly forming regiments, while drafted men can be\r\nsent to fill up the old ones, wherein man for man they are quite doubly as\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\nYou ask, \"Why is it that the North with her great armies so often is found\r\nwith inferiority of numbers face to face with the armies of the South?\"\r\nWhile I painfully know the fact, a military man, which I am not, would\r\nbetter answer the question. The fact I know has not been overlooked, and\r\nI suppose the cause of its continuance lies mainly in the other facts\r\nthat the enemy holds the interior and we the exterior lines, and that\r\nwe operate where the people convey information to the enemy, while he\r\noperates where they convey none to us.\r\n\r\nI have received the volume and letter which you did me the honor of\r\naddressing to me, and for which please accept my sincere thanks. You are\r\nmuch admired in America for the ability of your writings, and much\r\nloved for your generosity to us and your devotion to liberal principles\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\nYou are quite right as to the importance to us, for its bearing upon\r\nEurope, that we should achieve military successes, and the same is true\r\nfor us at home as well as abroad. Yet it seems unreasonable that a series\r\nof successes, extending through half a year, and clearing more than\r\n100,000 square miles of country, should help us so little, while a single\r\nhalf-defeat should hurt us so much. But let us be patient.\r\n\r\nI am very happy to know that my course has not conflicted with your\r\njudgment of propriety and policy I can only say that I have acted upon my\r\nbest convictions, without selfishness or malice, and that by the help of\r\nGod I shall continue to do so.\r\n\r\nPlease be assured of my highest respect and esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH AT A WAR MEETING, WASHINGTON, AUGUST 6, 1862\r\n\r\nFELLOW CITIZENS: I believe there is no precedent for my appearing before\r\nyou on this occasion, but it is also true that there is no precedent for\r\nyour being here yourselves, and I offer in justification of myself and\r\nof you that, upon examination, I have found nothing in the Constitution\r\nagainst it. I, however, have an impression that; there are younger\r\ngentlemen who will entertain you better and better address your\r\nunderstanding than I will or could, and therefore I propose but to detain\r\nyou a moment longer. I am very little inclined on any occasion to say\r\nanything unless I hope to produce some good by it. The only thing I think\r\nof just now not likely to be better said by some one else is a matter in\r\nwhich we have heard some other persons blamed for what I did myself There\r\nhas been a very widespread attempt to have a quarrel between General\r\nMcClellan and the Secretary of War Now, I occupy a position that enables\r\nme to believe that these two gentlemen are not nearly so deep in the\r\nquarrel as some presuming to be their friends. General McClellan's\r\nattitude is such that in the very selfishness of his nature he cannot but\r\nwish to be successful--and I hope he will--and the Secretary of War is\r\nprecisely in the same situation. If the military commanders in the field\r\ncannot be successful, not only the Secretary of War, but myself, for the\r\ntime being the master of both, cannot but be failures. I know General\r\nMcClellan wishes to be successful, and I know he does not wish it any more\r\nthan the Secretary of War for him, and both of them together no more\r\nthan I wish it. Sometimes we have a dispute about how many men General\r\nMcClellan has had, and those who would disparage him say he has had a very\r\nlarge number, and those who would disparage the Secretary of War insist\r\nthat General McClellan has had a very small number. The basis for this is,\r\nthere is always a wide difference, and on this occasion perhaps a wider\r\none, between the grand total on McClellan's rolls and the men actually\r\nfit for duty; and those who would disparage him talk of the grand total on\r\npaper, and those who would disparage the Secretary of War talk of those\r\nat present fit for duty. General McClellan has sometimes asked for things\r\nthat the Secretary of War did not give him. General McClellan is not to\r\nblame for asking for what he wanted and needed, and the Secretary of War\r\nis not to blame for not giving when he had none to give. And I say here,\r\nso far as I know, the Secretary of War has withheld no one thing at any\r\ntime in my power to give him. I have no accusation against him. I believe\r\nhe is a brave and able man, and I stand here, as justice requires me to\r\ndo, to take upon myself what has been charged on the Secretary of War as\r\nwithholding from him. I have talked longer than I expected to do, and now\r\nI avail myself of my privilege of saying no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR ANDREW. August 12, 1862.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, D.C.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR ANDREW, Boston, Mass.:\r\n\r\nYour despatch saying \"I can't get those regiments off because I can't\r\nget quick work out of the V. S. disbursing officer and the paymaster\" is\r\nreceived. Please say to these gentlemen that if they do not work quickly I\r\nwill make quick work with them. In the name of all that is reasonable, how\r\nlong does it take to pay a couple of regiments? We were never more in need\r\nof the arrival of regiments than now--even to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR CURTIN. August 12, 1862.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.C.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR CURTIN, Harrisburg, Penn.:\r\n\r\nIt is very important for some regiments to arrive here at once. What lack\r\nyou from us? What can we do to expedite matters? Answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL S. R. CURTIS. August 12, 1862.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL CURTIS, St. Louis, Missouri:\r\n\r\nWould the completion of the railroad some distance farther in the\r\ndirection of Springfield, Mo., be of any military advantage to you? Please\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS ON COLONIZATION TO A DEPUTATION OF COLORED MEN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, Thursday, August 14, 1862.\r\n\r\nThis afternoon the President of the United States gave an audience to a\r\ncommittee of colored men at the White House. They were introduced by\r\nRev. J. Mitchell, Commissioner of Emigration, E. M. Thomas, the chairman,\r\nremarked that they were there by invitation to hear what the Executive had\r\nto say to them.\r\n\r\nHaving all been seated, the President, after a few preliminary\r\nobservations, informed them that a sum of money had been appropriated by\r\nCongress, and placed at his disposition, for the purpose of aiding the\r\ncolonization, in some country, of the people, or a portion of them, of\r\nAfrican descent, thereby making it his duty, as it had for a long time\r\nbeen his inclination, to favor that cause. And why, he asked, should the\r\npeople of your race be colonized, and where? Why should they leave this\r\ncountry? This is, perhaps, the first question for proper consideration.\r\nYou and we are different races. We have between us a broader difference\r\nthan exists between almost any other two races. Whether it is right\r\nor wrong I need not discuss; but this physical difference is a great\r\ndisadvantage to us both, as I think. Your race suffer very greatly, many\r\nof them, by living among us, while ours suffer from your presence. In a\r\nword, we suffer on each side. If this is admitted, it affords a reason, at\r\nleast, why we should be separated. You here are free men, I suppose.\r\n\r\n[A voice--\"Yes, sir!\"]\r\n\r\nPerhaps you have long been free, or all your lives. Your race are\r\nsuffering, in my judgment, the greatest wrong inflicted on any people.\r\nBut even when you cease to be slaves, you are yet far removed from being\r\nplaced on an equality with the white race. You are cut off from many of\r\nthe advantages which the other race enjoys. The aspiration of men is to\r\nenjoy equality with the best when free, but on this broad continent not\r\na single man of your race is made the equal of a single man of ours. Go\r\nwhere you are treated the best, and the ban is still upon you. I do not\r\npropose to discuss this, but to present it as a fact, with which we have\r\nto deal. I cannot alter it if I would. It is a fact about which we all\r\nthink and feel alike, I and you. We look to our condition. Owing to the\r\nexistence of the two races on this continent, I need not recount to you\r\nthe effects upon white men, growing out of the institution of slavery.\r\n\r\nI believe in its general evil effects on the white race. See our present\r\ncondition--the country engaged in war--white men cutting one another's\r\nthroats--none knowing how far it will extend--and then consider what we\r\nknow to be the truth: But for your race among us there could not be war,\r\nalthough many men engaged on either side do not care for you one way or\r\nthe other. Nevertheless I repeat, without the institution of slavery and\r\nthe colored race as a basis, the war could not have an existence. It is\r\nbetter for us both, therefore, to be separated. I know that there are free\r\nmen among you, who, even if they could better their condition, are not as\r\nmuch inclined to go out of the country as those who, being slaves, could\r\nobtain their freedom on this condition. I suppose one of the principal\r\ndifficulties in the way of colonization is that the free colored man\r\ncannot see that his comfort would be advanced by it. You may believe\r\nthat you can live in WASHINGTON, or elsewhere in the United States, the\r\nremainder of your life, as easily, perhaps more so, than you can in any\r\nforeign Country; and hence you may come to the conclusion that you have\r\nnothing to do with the idea of going to a foreign country.\r\n\r\nThis is (I speak in no unkind sense) an extremely selfish view of the\r\ncase. You ought to do something to help those who are not so fortunate as\r\nyourselves. There is an unwillingness on the part of our people, harsh\r\nas it may be, for you free colored people to remain with us. Now, if you\r\ncould give a start to the white people, you would open a wide door for\r\nmany to be made free. If we deal with those who are not free at the\r\nbeginning, and whose intellects are clouded by slavery, we have very poor\r\nmaterial to start with. If intelligent colored men, such as are before me,\r\nwould move in this matter, much might be accomplished.\r\n\r\nIt is exceedingly important that we have men at the beginning capable\r\nof thinking as white men, and not those who have been systematically\r\noppressed. There is much to encourage you. For the sake of your race you\r\nshould sacrifice something of your present comfort for the purpose of\r\nbeing as grand in that respect as the white people. It is a cheering\r\nthought throughout life that something can be done to ameliorate the\r\ncondition of those who have been subject to the hard usages of the world.\r\nIt is difficult to make a man miserable while he feels he is worthy of\r\nhimself and claims kindred to the great God who made him. In the American\r\nRevolutionary war sacrifices were made by men engaged in it, but they were\r\ncheered by the future. General WASHINGTON himself endured greater physical\r\nhardships than if he had remained a British subject, yet he was a happy\r\nman because he had engaged in benefiting his race, in doing something for\r\nthe children of his neighbors, having none of his own.\r\n\r\nThe colony of Liberia has been in existence a long time. In a certain\r\nsense it is a success. The old President of Liberia, Roberts, has just\r\nbeen with me--the first time I ever saw him. He says they have within the\r\nbounds of that colony between three and four hundred thousand people, or\r\nmore than in some of our old States, such as Rhode Island or Delaware,\r\nor in some of our newer States, and less than in some of our larger ones.\r\nThey are not all American colonists or their descendants. Something less\r\nthan 12,000 have been sent thither from this country. Many of the original\r\nsettlers have died; yet, like people else-where, their offspring outnumber\r\nthose deceased. The question is, if the colored people are persuaded to go\r\nanywhere, why not there?\r\n\r\nOne reason for unwillingness to do so is that some of you would rather\r\nremain within reach of the country of your nativity. I do not know how\r\nmuch attachment you may have toward our race. It does not strike me that\r\nyou have the greatest reason to love them. But still you are attached to\r\nthem, at all events.\r\n\r\nThe place I am thinking about for a colony is in Central America. It is\r\nnearer to us than Liberia not much more than one fourth as far as Liberia,\r\nand within seven days' run by steamers. Unlike Liberia, it is a great line\r\nof travel--it is a highway. The country is a very excellent one for any\r\npeople, and with great natural resources and advantages, and especially\r\nbecause of the similarity of climate with your native soil, thus being\r\nsuited to your physical condition. The particular place I have in view is\r\nto be a great highway from the Atlantic or Caribbean Sea to the Pacific\r\nOcean, and this particular place has all the advantages for a colony. On\r\nboth sides there are harbors--among the finest in the world. Again, there\r\nis evidence of very rich coal-mines. A certain amount of coal is valuable\r\nin any country. Why I attach so much importance to coal is, it will afford\r\nan opportunity to the inhabitants for immediate employment till they get\r\nready to settle permanently in their homes. If you take colonists where\r\nthere is no good landing, there is a bad show; and so where there is\r\nnothing to cultivate and of which to make a farm. But if something is\r\nstarted so that you can get your daily bread as soon as reach you there,\r\nit is a great advantage. Coal land is the best thing I know of with which\r\nto commence an enterprise. To return--you have been talked to upon this\r\nsubject, and told that a speculation is intended by gentlemen who have an\r\ninterest in the country, including the coal-mines. We have been mistaken\r\nall our lives if we do not know whites, as well as blacks, look to their\r\nself-interest. Unless among those deficient of intellect, everybody\r\nyou trade with makes something. You meet with these things here and\r\neverywhere. If such persons have what will be an advantage to them,\r\nthe question is whether it cannot be made of advantage to you. You are\r\nintelligent, and know that success does not so much depend on external\r\nhelp as on self-reliance. Much, therefore, depends upon yourselves. As to\r\nthe coal-mines, I think I see the means available for your self-reliance.\r\nI shall, if I get a sufficient number of you engaged, have provision made\r\nthat you shall not be wronged. If you will engage in the enterprise,\r\nI will spend some of the money intrusted to me. I am not sure you will\r\nsucceed. The government may lose the money; but we cannot succeed unless\r\nwe try, and we think with care we can succeed. The political affairs in\r\nCentral America are not in quite as satisfactory a condition as I wish.\r\nThere are contending factions in that quarter, but it is true all the\r\nfactions are agreed alike on the subject of colonization, and want it, and\r\nare more generous than we are here.\r\n\r\nTo your colored race they have no objection I would endeavor to have\r\nyou made the equals, and have the best assurance that you should be the\r\nequals, of the best.\r\n\r\nThe practical thing I want to ascertain is whether I can get a number of\r\nable-bodied men, with their wives and children, who are willing to go when\r\nI present evidence of encouragement and protection. Could I get a hundred\r\ntolerably intelligent men, with their wives and children, and able to\r\n\"cut their own fodder,\" so to speak? Can I have fifty? If I could find\r\ntwenty-five able-bodied men, with a mixture of women and children--good\r\nthings in the family relation, I think,--I could make a successful\r\ncommencement. I want you to let me know whether this can be done or not.\r\nThis is the practical part of my wish to see you. These are subjects of\r\nvery great importance, worthy of a month's study, instead of a speech\r\ndelivered in an hour. I ask you, then, to consider seriously, not\r\npertaining to yourselves merely, nor for your race and ours for the\r\npresent time, but as one of the things, if successfully managed, the good\r\nof mankind--not confined to the present generation, but as\r\n\r\n  \"From age to age descends the lay\r\n   To millions yet to be,\r\n   Till far its echoes roll away\r\n   Into eternity.\"\r\n\r\nThe above is merely given as the substance of the President's remarks.\r\n\r\nThe chairman of the delegation briefly replied that they would hold a\r\nconsultation, and in a short time give an answer.\r\n\r\nThe President said: Take your full time-no hurry at all.\r\n\r\nThe delegation then withdrew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO OFFICER AT CAMP CHASE, OHIO.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., August 14, 1862.\r\n\r\nOFFICER in charge of Confederate prisoners at Camp Chase, Ohio:\r\n\r\nIt is believed that a Dr. J. J.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIRAM BARNEY.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August 16, 1862.\r\n\r\nHON. HIRAM BARNEY, New York:\r\n\r\nMrs. L. has $1000 for the benefit of the hospitals and she will be\r\nobliged, and send the pay, if you will be so good as to select and send\r\nher $200 worth of good lemons and $100 worth of good oranges.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE OF INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue\r\nwill please see Mr. Talcott, one of the best men there is, and, if any\r\ndifference, one they would like better than they do me.\r\n\r\nAugust 18, 1862\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

If appointed it must be\r\nwithout conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nOperator please send above for President. JOHN HAY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO Mrs. PRESTON.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., August 21, 1862.\r\n\r\nMrs. MARGARET PRESTON, Lexington, Ky.:\r\n\r\nYour despatch to Mrs. L. received yesterday. She is not well. Owing to\r\nher early and strong friendship for you, I would gladly oblige you, but I\r\ncannot absolutely do it. If General Boyle and Hon. James Guthrie, one\r\nor both, in their discretion see fit to give you the passes, this is my\r\nauthority to them for doing so.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL BURNSIDE OR GENERAL PARKE.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, August 21.\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL BURNSIDE OR GENERAL PARKE:\r\n\r\nWhat news about arrival of troops?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO G. P. WATSON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., August 21, 1862.\r\n\r\nGILLET F. WATSON, Williamsburg, Va.:\r\n\r\nYour telegram in regard to the lunatic asylum has been received. It\r\nis certainly a case of difficulty, but if you cannot remain, I cannot\r\nconceive who under my authority can. Remain as long as you safely can and\r\nprovide as well as you can for the poor inmates of the institution.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HORACE GREELEY.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August 22, 1862.\r\n\r\nHON. HORACE GREELEY.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--I have just read yours of the 19th, addressed to myself through\r\nthe New York Tribune. If there be in it any statements or assumptions of\r\nfact which I may know to be erroneous, I do not now and here controvert\r\nthem. If there be in it any inferences which I may believe to be falsely\r\ndrawn, I do not now and here argue against them. If there be perceptible\r\nin it an impatient and dictatorial tone, I waive it in deference to an old\r\nfriend, whose heart I have always supposed to be right.\r\n\r\nAs to the policy I \"seem to be pursuing,\" as you say, I have not meant to\r\nleave any one in doubt.\r\n\r\nI would save the Union. I would save it the shortest way under the\r\nConstitution. The sooner the national authority can be restored, the\r\nnearer the Union will be, \"the Union as it was.\" If there be those who\r\nwould not save the Union unless they could at the same time save slavery,\r\nI do not agree with them. If there be those who would not save the Union\r\nunless they could at the same time destroy slavery, I do not agree with\r\nthem. My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is\r\nnot either to save or destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without\r\nfreeing any slave, I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing\r\nall the slaves, I would do it; and if I could do it by freeing some and\r\nleaving others alone, I would also do that. What I do about slavery and\r\nthe colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save this Union; and\r\nwhat I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save\r\nthe Union. I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts\r\nthe cause, and I shall do more whenever I shall believe doing more will\r\nhelp the cause. I shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors; and\r\nI shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true views. I\r\nhave here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty, and\r\nI intend no modification of my oft expressed personal wish that all men,\r\neverywhere, could be free.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR YATES.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.C., August 13.1862. 8 A.M.\r\n\r\nHON. R. YATES, Springfield, Ill.:\r\n\r\nI am pained to hear that you reject the service of an officer we sent\r\nto assist in organizing and getting off troops. Pennsylvania and Indiana\r\naccepted such officers kindly, and they now have more than twice as many\r\nnew troops in the field as all the other States together. If Illinois\r\nhad got forward as many troops as Indiana, Cumberland Gap would soon be\r\nrelieved from its present peril. Please do not ruin us on punctilio.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR RAMSEY.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, August 27, 1862\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR RAMSEY, St. Paul, Minnesota:\r\n\r\nYours received. Attend to the Indians.

McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, August 29, 1862. 4.10 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN: Yours of to-day just received. I think your first\r\nalternative--to wit, \"to concentrate all our available forces to open\r\ncommunication with Pope\"--is the right one, but I wish not to control.\r\nThat I now leave to General Halleck, aided by your counsels.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

WEBSTER.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, September 9, 1862.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS WEBSTER, Philadelphia:\r\n\r\nYour despatch received, and referred to General Halleck, who must control\r\nthe questions presented. While I am not surprised at your anxiety, I do\r\nnot think you are in any danger. If half our troops were in Philadelphia,\r\nthe enemy could take it, because he would not fear to leave the other half\r\nin his rear; but with the whole of them here, he dares not leave them in\r\nhis rear.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR CURTIN. September 11, 1862.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.C.,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS EXCELLENCY ANDREW G. CURTIN, Governor of Pennsylvania, Harrisburg,\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\nSIR:--The application made to me by your adjutant general for authority\r\nto call out the militia of the State of Pennsylvania has received careful\r\nconsideration. It is my anxious desire to afford, as far as possible,\r\nthe means and power of the Federal Government to protect the State\r\nof Pennsylvania from invasion by the rebel forces; and since, in your\r\njudgment, the militia of the State are required, and have been called upon\r\nby you, to organize for home defense and protection, I sanction the call\r\nthat you have made, and will receive them into the service and pay of\r\nthe United States to the extent they can be armed, equipped, and usefully\r\nemployed. The arms and equipments now belonging to the General Government\r\nwill be needed for the troops called out for the national armies, so that\r\narms can only be furnished for the quota of militia furnished by the draft\r\nof nine months' men, heretofore ordered. But as arms may be supplied by\r\nthe militia under your call, these, with the 30,000 in your arsenal, will\r\nprobably be sufficient for the purpose contemplated by your call. You will\r\nbe authorized to provide such equipments as may be required, according\r\nto the regulations of the United States service, which, upon being turned\r\nover to the United States Quartermaster's Department, will be paid for\r\nat regulation prices, or the rates allowed by the department for such\r\narticles. Railroad transportation will also be paid for, as in other\r\ncases. Such general officers will be supplied as the exigencies of the\r\nservice will permit.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR CURTIN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, September 11, 1862 12M\r\n\r\nHON. ANDREW G. CURTIN:\r\n\r\nPlease tell me at once what is your latest news from or toward Hagerstown,\r\nor of the enemy's movement in any direction.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL C. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, SEPTEMBER 11, 1862. 6 PM\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nThis is explanatory. If Porter, Heintzelman, and Sigel were sent you, it\r\nwould sweep everything from the other side of the river, because the new\r\ntroops have been distributed among them, as I understand. Porter reports\r\nhimself 21,000 strong, which can only be by the addition of new troops.\r\nHe is ordered tonight to join you as quickly as possible. I am for sending\r\nyou all that can be spared, and I hope others can follow Porter very soon,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, D.C., SEPTEMBER 12, 1862\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN, Clarksburg, Maryland:\r\n\r\nHow does it look now?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR CURTIN.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON D.C., SEPTEMBER 12, 1862 10.35 AM\r\n\r\nHON. ANDREW G. CURTIN, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania:\r\n\r\nYour despatch asking for 80,000 disciplined troops to be sent to\r\nPennsylvania is received. Please consider we have not to exceed 80,000\r\ndisciplined troops, properly so called, this side of the mountains; and\r\nmost of them, with many of the new regiments, are now close in the rear\r\nof the enemy supposed to be invading Pennsylvania. Start half of them to\r\nHarrisburg, and the enemy will turn upon and beat the remaining half, and\r\nthen reach Harrisburg before the part going there, and beat it too when\r\nit comes. The best possible security for Pennsylvania is putting the\r\nstrongest force possible in rear of the enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL H. G. WRIGHT.\r\n\r\nMILITARY TELEGRAPH, WASHINGTON, September 12, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL WRIGHT, Cincinnati, Ohio:\r\n\r\nI am being appealed to from Louisville against your withdrawing troops\r\nfrom that place. While I cannot pretend to judge of the propriety of what\r\nyou are doing, you would much oblige me by furnishing me a rational answer\r\nto make to the governor and others at Louisville.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. T. BOYLE.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, September 12, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BOYLE, Louisville, Kentucky:\r\n\r\nYour despatch of last evening received. Where is the enemy which you dread\r\nin Louisville? How near to you? What is General Gilbert's opinion? With\r\nall possible respect for you, I must think General Wright's military\r\nopinion is the better. He is as much responsible for Louisville as\r\nfor Cincinnati. General Halleck telegraphed him on this very subject\r\nyesterday, and I telegraph him now; but for us here to control him\r\nthere on the ground would be a babel of confusion which would be utterly\r\nruinous. Where do you understand Buell to be, and what is he doing?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO A. HENRY.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C, September 12, 1862.\r\n\r\nHON. ALEXANDER HENRY, Philadelphia:\r\n\r\nYours of to-day received. General Halleck has made the best provision he\r\ncan for generals in Pennsylvania. Please do not be offended when I assure\r\nyou that in my confident belief Philadelphia is in no danger. Governor\r\nCurtin has just telegraphed me: \"I have advices that Jackson is crossing\r\nthe Potomac at Williamsport, and probably the whole rebel army will be\r\ndrawn from Maryland.\" At all events, Philadelphia is more than 150 miles\r\nfrom Hagerstown, and could not be reached by the rebel army in ten days,\r\nif no hindrance was interposed.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, D.C., September 12, 1862. 5.45 PM\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nGovernor Curtin telegraphs me:\r\n\r\n\"I have advices that Jackson is crossing the Potomac at Williamsport, and\r\nprobably the whole rebel army will be down from Maryland.\"\r\n\r\nReceiving nothing from Harper's Ferry or Martinsburg to-day, and positive\r\ninformation from Wheeling that the line is cut, corroborates the idea that\r\nthe enemy is crossing the Potomac. Please do not let him get off without\r\nbeing hurt.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n    [But he did! D.W.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO REQUEST THE PRESIDENT ISSUE A PROCLAMATION OF EMANCIPATION.\r\n\r\nA COMMITTEE FROM THE RELIGIOUS DENOMINATIONS OF CHICAGO,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeptember 13,1862.\r\n\r\nThe subject presented in the memorial is one upon which I have thought\r\nmuch for weeks past, and I may even say for months. I am approached with\r\nthe most opposite opinions and advice, and that by religious men, who are\r\nequally certain that they represent the Divine will. I am sure that either\r\nthe one or the other class is mistaken in that belief, and perhaps in some\r\nrespects both. I hope it will not be irreverent for me to say that if\r\nit is probable that God would reveal his will to others, on a point so\r\nconnected with my duty, it might be supposed he would reveal it directly\r\nto me; for, unless I am more deceived in myself than I often am, it is my\r\nearnest desire to know the will of Providence in this matter. And if I\r\ncan learn what it is I will do it! These are not, however, the days of\r\nmiracles, and I suppose it will be granted that I am not to expect a\r\ndirect revelation. I must study the plain physical facts of the case,\r\nascertain what is possible, and learn what appears to be wise and right.\r\n\r\nThe subject is difficult, and good men do not agree. For instance, the\r\nother day, four gentlemen of standing and intelligence from New York\r\ncalled as a delegation on business connected with the war; but\r\nbefore leaving two of them earnestly besought me to proclaim general\r\nemancipation, upon which the other two at once attacked them. You\r\nknow also that the last session of Congress had a decided majority of\r\nantislavery men, yet they could not unite on this policy. And the same is\r\ntrue of the religious people. Why, the rebel soldiers are praying with a\r\ngreat deal more earnestness, I fear, than our own troops, and expecting\r\nGod to favor their side: for one of our soldiers who had been taken\r\nprisoner told Senator Wilson a few days since that he met nothing so\r\ndiscouraging as the evident sincerity of those he was among in their\r\nprayers. But we will talk over the merits of the case.\r\n\r\nWhat good would a proclamation of emancipation from me do, especially\r\nas we are now situated? I do not want to issue a document that the whole\r\nworld will see must necessarily be inoperative, like the Pope's bull\r\nagainst the comet! Would my word free the slaves, when I cannot even\r\nenforce the Constitution in the rebel States? Is there a single court, or\r\nmagistrate or individual that would be influenced by it there? And what\r\nreason is there to think it would have any greater effect upon the\r\nslaves than the late law of Congress, which I approved, and which offers\r\nprotection and freedom to the slaves of rebel masters who come within our\r\nlines? Yet I cannot learn that that law has caused a single slave to come\r\nover to us. And suppose they could be induced by a proclamation of freedom\r\nfrom me to throw themselves upon us, what should we do with them? How can\r\nwe feed and care for such a multitude? General Butler wrote me a few days\r\nsince that he was issuing more rations to the slaves who have rushed to\r\nhim than to all the white troops under his command. They eat, and that is\r\nall; though it is true General Butler is feeding the whites also by the\r\nthousand; for it nearly amounts to a famine there. If, now, the pressure\r\nof the war should call off our forces from New Orleans to defend some\r\nother point, what is to prevent the masters from reducing the blacks\r\nto slavery again? for I am told that whenever the rebels take any black\r\nprisoners, free or slave, they immediately auction them off. They did so\r\nwith those they took from a boat that was aground in the Tennessee River\r\na few days ago. And then I am very ungenerously attacked for it! For\r\ninstance, when, after the late battles at and near Bull Run, an expedition\r\nwent out from Washington under a flag of truce to bury the dead and bring\r\nin the wounded, and the rebels seized the blacks who went along to help,\r\nand sent them into slavery, Horace Greeley said in his paper that the\r\ngovernment would probably do nothing about it. What could I do?\r\n\r\nNow, then, tell me, if you please, what possible result of good would\r\nfollow the issuing of such a proclamation as you desire? Understand, I\r\nraise no objections against it on legal or constitutional grounds; for, as\r\ncommander-in-chief of the army and navy, in time of war I suppose I have\r\na right to take any measure which may best subdue the enemy; nor do I\r\nurge objections of a moral nature, in view of possible consequences of\r\ninsurrection and massacre at the South. I view this matter as a practical\r\nwar measure, to be decided on according to the advantages or disadvantages\r\nit may offer to the suppression of the rebellion.\r\n\r\nI admit that slavery is the root of the rebellion, or at least its sine\r\nqua non. The ambition of politicians may have instigated them to act, but\r\nthey would have been impotent without slavery as their instrument. I will\r\nalso concede that emancipation would help us in Europe, and convince them\r\nthat we are incited by something more than ambition. I grant, further,\r\nthat it would help somewhat at the North, though not so much, I fear, as\r\nyou and those you represent imagine. Still, some additional strength would\r\nbe added in that way to the war, and then, unquestionably, it would weaken\r\nthe rebels by drawing off their laborers, which is of great importance;\r\nbut I am not so sure we could do much with the blacks. If we were to arm\r\nthem, I fear that in a few weeks the arms would be in the hands of the\r\nrebels; and, indeed, thus far we have not had arms enough to equip our\r\nwhite troops. I will mention another thing, though it meet only your scorn\r\nand contempt. There are fifty thousand bayonets in the Union armies from\r\nthe border slave States. It would be a serious matter if, in consequence\r\nof a proclamation such as you desire, they should go over to the rebels. I\r\ndo not think they all would--not so many, indeed, as a year ago, or as\r\nsix months ago--not so many to-day as yesterday. Every day increases their\r\nUnion feeling. They are also getting their pride enlisted, and want to\r\nbeat the rebels. Let me say one thing more: I think you should admit that\r\nwe already have an important principle to rally and unite the people, in\r\nthe fact that constitutional government is at stake. This is a fundamental\r\nidea going down about as deep as anything.\r\n\r\nDo not misunderstand me because I have mentioned these objections. They\r\nindicate the difficulties that have thus far prevented my action in some\r\nsuch way as you desire. I have not decided against a proclamation of\r\nliberty to the slaves, but hold the matter under advisement; and I can\r\nassure you that the subject is on my mind, by day and night, more than any\r\nother. Whatever shall appear to be God's will, I will do. I trust that\r\nin the freedom with which I have canvassed your views I have not in any\r\nrespect injured your feelings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL H. G. WRIGHT.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., September 14, 1862.\r\n\r\nGENERAL WRIGHT, Cincinnati, Ohio:\r\n\r\nThanks for your despatch. Can you not pursue the retreating enemy, and\r\nrelieve Cumberland Gap?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON,\r\n\r\nSeptember 15, 1862. 2.45 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nYour despatch of to-day received. God bless you, and all with you. Destroy\r\nthe rebel army if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO J. K. DUBOIS. WASHINGTON, D.C.,\r\n\r\nSeptember 15, 1862. 3 P.M.\r\n\r\nHON. K. DUBOIS, Springfield, Illinois:\r\n\r\nI now consider it safe to say that General McClellan has gained a great\r\nvictory over the great rebel army in Maryland, between Fredericktown and\r\nHagerstown. He is now pursuing the flying foe.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n[But not very fast--and he did not catch them! D.W.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR CURTIN,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., September 16, 1862. Noon.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR CURTIN, Harrisburg:\r\n\r\nWhat do you hear from General McClellan's army? We have nothing from him\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR MORTON.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., September 17, 1862.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR O. P. MORTON, Indianapolis, Indiana:\r\n\r\nI have received your despatch in regard to recommendations of General\r\nWright. I have received no such despatch from him, at least not that I can\r\nremember. I refer yours for General Halleck's consideration.\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL KETCHUM.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, September 20, 1862.\r\n\r\nGENERAL KETCHUM, Springfield, Illinois:\r\n\r\nHow many regiments are there in Illinois, ready for service but for want\r\nof arms? How many arms have you there ready for distribution?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION, SEPTEMBER 22, 1862.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nI, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of America and\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy thereof, do hereby proclaim and\r\ndeclare that hereafter, as heretofore, the war will be prosecuted for the\r\nobject of practically restoring the constitutional relation between the\r\nUnited States and each of the States and the people thereof in which\r\nStates that relation is or may be suspended or disturbed.\r\n\r\nThat it is my purpose, upon the next meeting of Congress, to again\r\nrecommend the adoption of a practical measure tendering pecuniary aid\r\nto the free acceptance or rejection of all slave States, so called, the\r\npeople whereof may not then be in rebellion against the United States,\r\nand which States may then have voluntarily adopted, or thereafter may\r\nvoluntarily adopt, immediate or gradual abolishment of slavery within\r\ntheir respective limits; and that the effort to colonize persons of\r\nAfrican descent with their consent upon this continent or elsewhere, with\r\nthe previously obtained consent of the governments existing there, will be\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\nThat on the 1st day of January, A.D. 1863, all persons held as slaves\r\nwithin any State or designated part of a State the people whereof\r\nshall then be in rebellion against the United States shall be then,\r\nthenceforward, and forever free; and the executive government of the\r\nUnited States, including the military and naval authority thereof, will\r\nrecognize and maintain the freedom of such persons and will do no act or\r\nacts to repress such persons, or any of them, in any efforts they may make\r\nfor their actual freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat the Executive will on the 1st day of January aforesaid, by\r\nproclamation, designate the States and parts of States, if any, in which\r\nthe people thereof, respectively, shall then be in rebellion against the\r\nUnited States; and the fact that any State or the people thereof shall on\r\nthat day be in good faith represented in the Congress of the United States\r\nby members chosen thereto at elections wherein a majority of the qualified\r\nvoters of such State shall have participated shall, in the absence of\r\nstrong countervailing testimony, be deemed conclusive evidence that such\r\nState and the people thereof are not then in rebellion against the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThat attention is hereby called to an act of Congress entitled \"An act to\r\nmake an additional article of war,\" approved March 13, 1862, and which act\r\nis in the words and figure following:\r\n\r\n\"Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates of America in Congress assembled, That hereafter the following\r\nshall be promulgated as an additional article of war for the government of\r\nthe Army of the United States and shall be obeyed and observed as such.\r\n\r\n\"ART.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President: WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION SUSPENDING THE WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS,\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER 24, 1862.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\r\n\r\nA Proclamation\r\n\r\nWhereas it has become necessary to call into service not only volunteers,\r\nbut also portions of the militia of the States by draft, in order to\r\nsuppress the insurrection existing in the United States, and disloyal\r\npersons are not adequately restrained by the ordinary processes of law\r\nfrom hindering this measure, and from giving aid and comfort in various\r\nways to the insurrection:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, be it ordered\r\n\r\nFirst. That during the existing insurrection, and as a necessary measure\r\nfor suppressing the same, all rebels and insurgents, their aiders and\r\nabettors within the United States, and all persons discouraging volunteer\r\nenlistments, resisting militia drafts, or guilty of any disloyal practice\r\naffording aid and comfort to rebels against the authority of the\r\nUnited States, shall be subject to martial law, and liable to trial and\r\npunishment by courts-martial or military commissions.\r\n\r\nSecond. That the writ of habeas corpus is suspended in respect to all\r\npersons arrested, or who are now, or hereafter during the rebellion shall\r\nbe, imprisoned in any fort camp, arsenal, military prison or other\r\nplace of confinement by any military authority or by the sentence of any\r\ncourt-martial or military commission.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the\r\nUnited States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of WASHINGTON, this twenty-fourth day of September. A.D.\r\neighteen hundred and sixty-two, and of the independence of the United\r\nStates the eighty-seventh.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:  WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO SERENADE, SEPTEMBER 24, 1862.\r\n\r\nI appear before you to do little more than acknowledge the courtesy you\r\npay me, and to thank you for it. I have not been distinctly informed\r\nwhy it is that on this occasion you appear to do me this honor, though I\r\nsuppose it is because of the proclamation. What I did, I did after a\r\nvery full deliberation, and under a very heavy and solemn sense of\r\nresponsibility. I can only trust in God I have made no mistake. I shall\r\nmake no attempt on this occasion to sustain what I have done or said by\r\nany comment. It is now for the country and the world to pass judgment and,\r\nmaybe, take action upon it.\r\n\r\nI will say no more upon this subject. In my position I am environed with\r\ndifficulties. Yet they are scarcely so great as the difficulties of those\r\nwho upon the battle-field are endeavoring to purchase with their blood and\r\ntheir lives the future happiness and prosperity of this country. Let us\r\nnever forget them. On the fourteenth and seventeenth days of this present\r\nmonth there have been battles bravely, skillfully, and successfully\r\nfought. We do not yet know the particulars. Let us be sure that, in giving\r\npraise to certain individuals, we do no injustice to others. I only ask\r\nyou, at the conclusion of these few remarks, to give three hearty cheers\r\nfor all good and brave officers and men who fought those successful\r\nbattles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD EXPLAINING THE DISMISSAL OF MAJOR JOHN J. KEY\r\n\r\nFROM THE MILITARY SERVICE OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\r\n\r\nSeptember 26, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR JOHN J. KEY:\r\n\r\nI am informed that, in answer to the question, \"Why was not the rebel army\r\nbagged immediately after the battle near Sharpsburg?\" propounded to you\r\nby Major Levi C. Turner, Judge Advocate, etc., you said: \"That is not the\r\ngame. The object is, that neither army shall get much advantage of the\r\nother; that both shall be kept in the field till they are exhausted, when\r\nwe will make a compromise and save slavery.\"\r\n\r\nI shall be very happy if you will, within twenty-four hours from the\r\nreceipt of this, prove to me by Major Turner that you did not, either\r\nliterally or in substance, make the answer stated.\r\n\r\n[Above delivered to Major Key at 10.25 a.m. September 27th.]\r\n\r\nAt about 11 o'clock A.M., September 27, 1862, Major Key and Major Turner\r\nappeared before me. Major Turner says:\r\n\r\n\"As I remember it, the conversation was: 'Why did we not bag them after\r\nthe battle of Sharpsburg?' Major Key's reply was: 'That was not the game;\r\nthat we should tire the rebels out and ourselves; that that was the\r\nonly way the Union could be preserved, we come together fraternally, and\r\nslavery be saved.'\"\r\n\r\nOn cross-examination, Major Turner says he has frequently heard Major Key\r\nconverse in regard to the present troubles, and never heard him utter\r\na sentiment unfavorable to the maintenance of the Union. He has never\r\nuttered anything which he, Major T., would call disloyalty. The particular\r\nconversation detailed was a private one.\r\n\r\n           [Indorsement on the above.]\r\n\r\nIn my view, it is wholly inadmissible for any gentleman holding a military\r\ncommission from the United States to utter such sentiments as Major Key is\r\nwithin proved to have done. Therefore, let Major John J. Key be forthwith\r\ndismissed from the military service of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HANNIBAL HAMLIN.\r\n\r\n(Strictly private.)\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\r\n\r\nSeptember 28, 1862.\r\n\r\nHON. HANNIBAL HAMLIN.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR: Your kind letter of the 25th is just received. It is known to\r\nsome that, while I hope something from the proclamation, my expectations\r\nare not as sanguine as are those of some friends. The time for its effect\r\nsouthward has not come; but northward the effect should be instantaneous.\r\nIt is six days old, and, while commendation in newspapers and by\r\ndistinguished individuals is all that a vain man could wish, the stocks\r\nhave declined, and troops come forward more slowly than ever. This, looked\r\nsoberly in the face, is not very satisfactory. We have fewer troops in\r\nthe field at the end of the six days than we had at the beginning--the\r\nattrition among the old outnumbering the addition by the new. The North\r\nresponds to the proclamation sufficiently in breath; but breath alone\r\nkills no rebels.\r\n\r\nI wish I could write more cheerfully; nor do I thank you the less for the\r\nkindness of your letter.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL HALLECK.\r\n\r\nMcCLELLAN'S HEADQUARTERS, October 3, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK:\r\n\r\nGeneral Stuart, of the rebel army, has sent in a few of our prisoners\r\nunder a flag of truce, paroled with terms to prevent their fighting the\r\nIndians, and evidently seeking to commit us to their right to parole\r\nprisoners in that way. My inclination is to send the prisoners back with\r\na definite notice that we will recognize no paroles given to our prisoners\r\nby the rebels as extending beyond a prohibition against fighting them,\r\nthough I wish your opinion upon it, based both upon the general law and\r\nour cartel. I wish to avoid violations of the law and bad faith. Answer as\r\nquickly as possible, as the thing, if done at all, should be done at once.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN, President\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS TO THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC AT FREDERICK, MARYLAND,\r\n\r\nOCTOBER, 4, 1862.\r\n\r\nI am surrounded by soldiers and a little farther off by the citizens of\r\nthis good City of Frederick. Nevertheless I can only say, as I did five\r\nminutes ago, it is not proper for me to make speeches in my present\r\nposition. I return thanks to our soldiers for the good services they have\r\nrendered, the energy they have shown, the hardships they have endured, and\r\nthe blood they have shed for this Union of ours; and I also return thanks,\r\nnot only to the soldiers, but to the good citizens of Frederick, and to\r\nthe good men, women, and children in this land of ours, for their devotion\r\nto this glorious cause; and I say this with no malice in my heart towards\r\nthose who have done otherwise. May our children and children's children,\r\nfor a thousand generations, continue to enjoy the benefits conferred upon\r\nus by a united country, and have cause yet to rejoice under these glorious\r\ninstitutions, bequeathed to us by WASHINGTON and his compeers. Now, my\r\nfriends, soldiers and citizens, I can only say once more-farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM FROM GENERAL HALLECK\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN., WASHINGTON, D. C., October 6, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nI am instructed to telegraph you as follows: The President directs that\r\nyou cross the Potomac and give battle to the enemy, or drive him south.\r\nYour army must move now, while the roads are good. If you cross the river\r\nbetween the enemy and Washington, and cover the latter by your operation,\r\nyou can be reinforced by thirty thousand men. If you move up the valley of\r\nthe Shenandoah, not more than twelve or fifteen thousand can be sent you.\r\nThe President advises the interior line between Washington and the enemy,\r\nbut does not order it. He is very desirous that your army move as soon as\r\npossible. You will immediately report what line you adopt, and when you\r\nintend to cross the river; also to what point the reinforcements are to\r\nbe sent. It is necessary that the plan of your operations be positively\r\ndetermined on, before orders are given for building bridges and repairing\r\nrailroads. I am directed to add that the Secretary of War and the\r\nGeneral-in-chief fully concur with the President in these directions.\r\n\r\nH. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October 7, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN, Hdqs. Army of the Potomac:\r\n\r\nYou wish to see your family and I wish to oblige you. It might be left\r\nto your own discretion; certainly so, if Mrs. M. could meet you here at\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO T. H. CLAY.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, October 8, 1862.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS H. CLAY, Cincinnati, Ohio:\r\n\r\nYou cannot have reflected seriously when you ask that I shall order\r\nGeneral Morgan's command to Kentucky as a favor because they have marched\r\nfrom Cumberland Gap. The precedent established by it would evidently break\r\nup the whole army. Buell's old troops, now in pursuit of Bragg, have done\r\nmore hard marching recently; and, in fact, if you include marching and\r\nfighting, there are scarcely any old troops east or west of the mountains\r\nthat have not done as hard service. I sincerely wish war was an easier\r\nand pleasanter business than it is; but it does not admit of holidays.\r\nOn Morgan's command, where it is now sent, as I understand, depends the\r\nquestion whether the enemy will get to the Ohio River in another place.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL U. S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., October 8, 1862\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL GRANT:\r\n\r\nI congratulate you and all concerned in your recent battles and victories.\r\nHow does it all sum up? I especially regret the death of General\r\nHackleman, and am very anxious to know the condition of General Oglesby,\r\nwho is an intimate personal friend.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. T. BOYLE.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, October 11,1862. 4 P.M.\r\n\r\nGENERAL BOYLE, Louisville, Kentucky:\r\n\r\nPlease send any news you have from General Buell to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. T. BOYLE.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, October 12, 1862. 4.10 P.M.\r\n\r\nGENERAL BOYLE, Louisville, Kentucky:\r\n\r\nWe are anxious to hear from General Buell's army. We have heard nothing\r\nsince day before yesterday. Have you anything?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL CURTIS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., October 12, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL CURTIS, Saint Louis, Missouri:\r\n\r\nWould the completion of the railroad some distance further in the\r\ndirection of Springfield, Mo., be of any military advantage to you? Please\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October 13, 1862.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR--You remember my speaking to you of what I called your\r\nover-cautiousness. Are you not over-cautious when you assume that you\r\ncannot do what the enemy is constantly doing? Should you not claim to be\r\nat least his equal in prowess, and act upon the claim?\r\n\r\nAs I understand, you telegraphed General Halleck that you cannot subsist\r\nyour army at Winchester unless the railroad from Harper's Ferry to that\r\npoint be put in working order. But the enemy does now subsist his army\r\nat Winchester, at a distance nearly twice as great from railroad\r\ntransportation as you would have to do, without the railroad last named.\r\nHe now wagons from Culpepper Court-House, which is just about twice as far\r\nas you would have to do from Harper's Ferry. He is certainly not more\r\nthan half as well provided with wagons as you are. I certainly should be\r\npleased for you to have the advantage of the railroad from Harper's Perry\r\nto Winchester; but it wastes an the remainder of autumn to give it to you,\r\nand, in fact, ignores the question of time, which cannot and must not be\r\nignored.\r\n\r\nAgain, one of the standard maxims of war, as you know, is \"to operate\r\nupon the enemy's communications as much as possible, without exposing your\r\nown.\" You seem to act as if this applies against you, but cannot apply in\r\nyour favor. Change positions with the enemy, and think you not he would\r\nbreak your communication with Richmond within the next twenty-four hours?\r\nYou dread his going into Pennsylvania. But if he does so in full force, he\r\ngives up his communications to you absolutely, and you have nothing to do\r\nbut to follow and ruin him; if he does so with less than full force, fall\r\nupon and beat what is left behind all the easier.\r\n\r\nExclusive of the water line, you are now nearer to Richmond than the enemy\r\nis, by the route that you can and he must take. Why can you not reach\r\nthere before him, unless you admit that he is more than your equal on a\r\nmarch? His route is the arc of a circle, while yours is the chord. The\r\nroads are as good on yours as on his.\r\n\r\nYou know I desired, but did not order, you to cross the Potomac below\r\ninstead of above the Shenandoah and Blue Ridge. My idea was, that this\r\nwould at once menace the enemy's communications, which I would seize if\r\nhe would permit. If he should move northward, I would follow him\r\nclosely, holding his communications. If he should prevent our seizing his\r\ncommunications, and move toward Richmond, I would press closely to him,\r\nfight him if a favorable opportunity should present, and at least try to\r\nbeat him to Richmond on the inside track. I say \"try;\" if we never try,\r\nwe shall never succeed. If he makes a stand at Winchester, moving neither\r\nnorth or south, I would fight him there, on the idea that if we cannot\r\nbeat him when he bears the wastage of coming to us, we never can when we\r\nbear the wastage of going to him. This proposition is a simple truth,\r\nand is too important to be lost sight of for a moment. In coming to us\r\nhe tenders us an advantage which we should not waive. We should not so\r\noperate as to merely drive him away. As we must beat him somewhere or fail\r\nfinally, we can do it, if at all, easier near to us than far away. If we\r\ncannot beat the enemy where he now is, we never can, he again being within\r\nthe entrenchments of Richmond.\r\n\r\n[And, indeed, the enemy was let back into Richmond and it took another two\r\nyears and thousands of dead for McClelland cowardice--if that was all that\r\nit was. I still suspect, and I think the evidence is overwhelming that he\r\nwas, either secretly a supporter of the South, or, what is more likely,\r\na politician readying for a different campaign: that of the Presidency of\r\nthe United States.]\r\n\r\nRecurring to the idea of going to Richmond on the inside track, the\r\nfacility of supplying from the side away from the enemy is remarkable, as\r\nit were, by the different spokes of a wheel extending from the hub toward\r\nthe rim, and this whether you move directly by the chord or on the inside\r\narc, hugging the Blue Ridge more closely. The chord line, as you see,\r\ncarries you by Aldie, Hay Market, and Fredericksburg; and you see how\r\nturnpikes, railroads, and finally the Potomac, by Aquia Creek, meet you at\r\nall points from WASHINGTON; the same, only the lines lengthened a little,\r\nif you press closer to the Blue Ridge part of the way.\r\n\r\nThe gaps through the Blue Ridge I understand to be about the following\r\ndistances from Harper's Ferry, to wit: Vestal's, 5 miles; Gregory's, 13;\r\nSnicker's, 18; Ashby's, 28; Manassas, 38; Chester, 45; and Thornton's,\r\n53. I should think it preferable to take the route nearest the enemy,\r\ndisabling him to make an important move without your knowledge, and\r\ncompelling him to keep his forces together for dread of you. The gaps\r\nwould enable you to attack if you should wish. For a great part of the\r\nway you would be practically between the enemy and both WASHINGTON and\r\nRichmond, enabling us to spare you the greatest number of troops from\r\nhere. When at length running for Richmond ahead of him enables him to\r\nmove this way, if he does so, turn and attack him in rear. But I think he\r\nshould be engaged long before such a point is reached. It is all easy\r\nif our troops march as well as the enemy, and it is unmanly to say they\r\ncannot do it. This letter is in no sense an order.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR PIERPOINT.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, D. C., October 16, 1862.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR PIERPOINT, Wheeling, Virginia:\r\n\r\nYour despatch of to-day received. I am very sorry to have offended you. I\r\nappointed the collector, as I thought, on your written recommendation, and\r\nthe assessor also with your testimony of worthiness, although I know you\r\npreferred a different man. I will examine to-morrow whether I am mistaken\r\nin this.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE ORDER ESTABLISHING A PROVISIONAL COURT IN LOUISIANA.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON CITY,\r\n\r\nOctober 20, 1862.\r\n\r\nThe insurrection which has for some time prevailed in several of the\r\nStates of this Union, including Louisiana, having temporarily subverted\r\nand swept away the civil institutions of that State, including the\r\njudiciary and the judicial authorities of the Union, so that it has\r\nbecome necessary to hold the State in military Occupation, and it being\r\nindispensably necessary that there shall be some judicial tribunal\r\nexisting there capable of administering justice, I have therefore thought\r\nit proper to appoint, and I do hereby constitute, a provisional court,\r\nwhich shall be a court of record, for the State of Louisiana; and I do\r\nhereby appoint Charles A Peabody, of New York, to be a provisional judge\r\nto hold said court, with authority to hear, try, and determine all\r\ncauses, civil and criminal, including causes in law, equity, revenue, and\r\nadmiralty, and particularly all such powers and jurisdiction as belong\r\nto the district and circuit courts of the United States, conforming his\r\nproceedings so far as possible to the course of proceedings and practice\r\nwhich has been customary in the courts of the United States and Louisiana,\r\nhis judgment to be final and conclusive. And I do hereby authorize and\r\nempower the said judge to make and establish such rules and regulations\r\nas may be necessary for the exercise of his jurisdiction, and empower the\r\nsaid judge to appoint a prosecuting attorney, marshal, and clerk of the\r\nsaid court, who shall perform the functions of attorney, marshal, and\r\nclerk according to such proceedings and practice as before mentioned and\r\nsuch rules and regulations as may be made and established by said judge.\r\nThese appointments are to continue during the pleasure of the President,\r\nnot extending beyond the military occupation of the city of New Orleans\r\nor the restoration of the civil authority in that city and in the State of\r\nLouisiana. These officers shall be paid, out of the contingent fund of the\r\nWar Department, compensation as follows:\r\n\r\nThe judge at the rate of $3500 per annum; the prosecuting attorney,\r\nincluding the fees, at the rate of $3000 per annum; the marshal, including\r\nthe fees, at the rate of $3000 per annum; and the clerk, including the\r\nfees, at the rate of $2500 per annum; such compensations to be certified\r\nby the Secretary of War. A copy of this order, certified by the Secretary\r\nof War and delivered to such judge, shall be deemed and held to be a\r\nsufficient commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN,\r\n\r\nPresident of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL U.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\r\n\r\nOctober 21, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL U. S. GRANT:\r\n\r\nThe bearer of this, Thomas R. Smith, a citizen of Tennessee, goes to that\r\nState seeking to have such of the people thereof as desire to avoid the\r\nunsatisfactory prospect before them, and to have peace again upon the\r\nold terms, under the Constitution of the United States, to manifest\r\nsuch desire by elections of members to the Congress of the United States\r\nparticularly, and perhaps a Legislature, State officers, and a United\r\nStates senator friendly to their object.\r\n\r\nI shall be glad for you and each of you to aid him, and all others acting\r\nfor this object, as much as possible. In all available ways give the\r\npeople a show to express their wishes at these elections.\r\n\r\nFollow law, and forms of law, as far as convenient, but at all events get\r\nthe expression of the largest number of the people possible. All see how\r\nsuch action will connect with and affect the proclamation of September\r\n22. Of course the men elected should be gentlemen of character, willing\r\nto swear support to the Constitution as of old, and known to be above\r\nreasonable suspicion of duplicity.\r\n\r\nYours very respectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL JAMESON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October 21, 1862.\r\n\r\nGENERAL JAMESON, Upper Stillwater, Me.:\r\n\r\nHow is your health now? Do you or not wish Lieut. R. P. Crawford to be\r\nrestored to his office?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL McCLELLAN'S TIRED HORSES\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, October 24 [25?], 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nI have just read your despatch about sore-tongued and fatigued horses.\r\nWill you pardon me for asking what the horses of your army have done since\r\nthe battle of Antietam that fatigues anything?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION WASHINGTON, October 26, 1862. 11.30am\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nYours, in reply to mine about horses, received. Of course you know the\r\nfacts better than I; still two considerations remain: Stuart's cavalry\r\noutmarched ours, having certainly done more marked service on the\r\nPeninsula and everywhere since. Secondly, will not a movement of our army\r\nbe a relief to the cavalry, compelling the enemy to concentrate instead\r\nof foraging in squads everywhere? But I am so rejoiced to learn from\r\nyour despatch to General Halleck that you begin crossing the river this\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL DIX.\r\n\r\n(Private and confidential.)\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON October 26, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL Dix, Fort Monroe, Virginia:\r\n\r\nYour despatch to Mr. Stanton, of which the enclosed is a copy, has been\r\nhanded me by him. It would be dangerous for me now to begin construing and\r\nmaking specific applications of the proclamation.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious to all that I therein intended to give time and opportunity.\r\nAlso, it is seen I left myself at liberty to exempt parts of States.\r\nWithout saying more, I shall be very glad if any Congressional district\r\nwill, in good faith, do as your despatch contemplates.\r\n\r\nCould you give me the facts which prompted you to telegraph?\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October 27, 1862, 12.10\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nYours of yesterday received. Most certainly I intend no injustice to any,\r\nand if I have done any I deeply regret it. To be told, after more than\r\nfive weeks' total inaction of the army, and during which period we have\r\nsent to the army every fresh horse we possibly could, amounting in the\r\nwhole to 7918, that the cavalry horses were too much fatigued to move,\r\npresents a very cheerless, almost hopeless, prospect for the future,\r\nand it may have forced something of impatience in my despatch. If not\r\nrecruited and rested then, when could they ever be? I suppose the river is\r\nrising, and I am glad to believe you are crossing.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October 27, 1862. 3.25pm\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nYour despatch of 3 P.M. to-day, in regard to filling up old regiments with\r\ndrafted men, is received, and the request therein shall be complied with\r\nas far as practicable.\r\n\r\nAnd now I ask a distinct answer to the question, Is it your purpose not\r\nto go into action again until the men now being drafted in the States are\r\nincorporated into the old regiments?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October 29, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLELLAN:\r\n\r\nYour despatches of night before last, yesterday, and last night all\r\nreceived. I am much pleased with the movement of the army. When you get\r\nentirely across the river let me know. What do you know of the enemy?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR CURTIN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October 30, 1862.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR CURTIN, Harrisburg:\r\n\r\nBy some means I have not seen your despatch of the 27th about order No.154\r\nuntil this moment. I now learn, what I knew nothing of before, that the\r\nhistory of the order is as follows:\r\n\r\nWhen General McClellan telegraphed asking General Halleck to have the\r\norder made, General Halleck went to the Secretary of War with it, stating\r\nhis approval of the plan. The Secretary assented and General Halleck wrote\r\nthe order. It was a military question, which the Secretary supposed the\r\nGeneral understood better than he.\r\n\r\nI wish I could see Governor Curtin.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, October 31, 1862.\r\n\r\nGOV. ANDREW JOHNSON, Nashville, Tenn., via Louisville, Ky.:\r\n\r\nYours of the 29th received. I shall take it to General Halleck, but I\r\nalready know it will be inconvenient to take General Morgan's command from\r\nwhere it now is. I am glad to hear you speak hopefully of Tennessee. I\r\nsincerely hope Rosecrans may find it possible to do something for her.\r\nDavid Nelson, son of the M. C. of your State, regrets his father's final\r\ndefection, and asks me for a situation. Do you know him? Could he be of\r\nservice to you or to Tennessee in any capacity in which I could send him?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\r\n\r\nNovember 1, 1862.\r\n\r\nTO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN: Captain Derrickson, with his company, has been for\r\nsome time keeping guard at my residence, now at the Soldiers' Retreat. He\r\nand his company are very agreeable to me, and while it is deemed proper\r\nfor any guard to remain, none would be more satisfactory than Captain\r\nDerrickson and his company.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER RELIEVING GENERAL G. B. McCLELLAN\r\n\r\nAND MAKING OTHER CHANGES.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION WASHINGTON, November 5, 1862.\r\n\r\nBy direction of the President, it is ordered that Major-General McClellan\r\nbe relieved from the command of the Army of the Potomac, and that\r\nMajor-General Burnside take the command of that army. Also that\r\nMajor-General Hunter take command of the corps in said army which is now\r\ncommanded by General Burnside. That Major-General Fitz. John Porter be\r\nrelieved from command of the corps he now commands in said army, and that\r\nMajor-General Hooker take command of said corps.\r\n\r\nThe general-in-chief is authorized, in [his] discretion, to issue an order\r\nsubstantially as the above forthwith, or so soon as he may deem proper.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

I wish to see you at once will you come? Please\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO COLONEL LOWE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, November 7,1862.\r\n\r\nCOL. W. W.

Please forward as soon as possible the full and complete record\r\nof their convictions; and if the record does not fully indicate the more\r\nguilty and influential of the culprits, please have a careful statement\r\nmade on these points and forwarded to me.

He is in command of\r\na considerable land force for operating in the South, and I shall be glad\r\nfor you to co-Operate with him and give him such assistance as you can\r\nconsistently with your orders from the Navy Department.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER CONCERNING BLOCKADE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, November 12, 1862.\r\n\r\nOrdered, First: that clearances issued by the Treasury Department for\r\nvessels or merchandise bound for the port of Norfolk, for the military\r\nnecessities of the department, certified by the military commandant at\r\nFort Monroe, shall be allowed to enter said port.\r\n\r\nSecond: that vessels and domestic produce from Norfolk, permitted by\r\nthe military commandant at Fort Monroe for the military purposes of his\r\ncommand, shall on his permit be allowed to pass from said port to their\r\ndestination in any port not blockaded by the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER CONCERNING THE CONFISCATION ACT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, November 13, 1862.\r\n\r\nOrdered, by the President of the United States, That the Attorney-General\r\nbe charged with the superintendence and direction of all proceedings to be\r\nhad under the act of Congress of the 17th of July, 1862, entitled \"An act\r\nto suppress insurrection, to punish treason and rebellion, to seize and\r\nconfiscate the property of rebels, and for other purposes,\" in so far\r\nas may concern the seizure, prosecution, and condemnation of the estate,\r\nproperty, and effects of rebels and traitors, as mentioned and provided\r\nfor in the fifth, sixth, and seventh sections of the said act of Congress.\r\nAnd the Attorney-General is authorized and required to give to the\r\nattorneys and marshals of the United States such instructions and\r\ndirections as he may find needful and convenient touching all such\r\nseizures, prosecutions, and condemnations, and, moreover, to authorize all\r\nsuch attorneys and marshals, whenever there may be reasonable ground to\r\nfear any forcible resistance to them in the discharge of their respective\r\nduties in this behalf, to call upon any military officer in command of\r\nthe forces of the United States to give to them such aid, protection,\r\nand support as may be necessary to enable them safely and efficiently to\r\ndischarge their respective duties; and all such commanding officers are\r\nrequired promptly to obey such call, and to render the necessary service\r\nas far as may be in their power consistently with their other duties.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

ANDREW JOHNSON, Nashville, Tennessee:\r\n\r\nYour despatch of the 4th, about returning troops from western Virginia to\r\nTennessee, is just received, and I have been to General Halleck with it.\r\nHe says an order has already been made by which those troops have already\r\nmoved, or soon will move, to Tennessee.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ORDER RESPECTING THE OBSERVANCE OF THE SABBATH DAY\r\n\r\nIN THE ARMY AND NAVY.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, November 15, 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President, Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, desires and\r\nenjoins the orderly observance of the Sabbath by the officers and men in\r\nthe military and naval service. The importance for man and beast of\r\nthe prescribed weekly rest, the sacred rights of Christian soldiers and\r\nsailors, a becoming deference to the best sentiment of a Christian people,\r\nand a due regard for the divine will demand that Sunday labor in the army\r\nand navy be reduced to the measure of strict necessity.\r\n\r\nThe discipline and character of the national forces should not suffer nor\r\nthe cause they defend be imperilled by the profanation of the day or name\r\nof the Most High. \"At this time of public distress,\" adopting the words of\r\nWashington in 1776, \"men may find enough to do in the service of God and\r\ntheir country without abandoning themselves to vice and immorality.\"\r\nThe first general order issued by the Father of his Country after the\r\nDeclaration of Independence indicates the spirit in which our institutions\r\nwere founded and should ever be defended:\r\n\r\n\"The General hopes and trusts that every officer and man will endeavor to\r\nlive and act as becomes a Christian soldier defending the dearest rights\r\nand liberties of his country.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

BLAIR:\r\n\r\nYour brother says you are solicitous to be ordered to join General\r\nMcLernand. I suppose you are ordered to Helena; this means that you are\r\nto form part of McLernand's expedition as it moves down the river; and\r\nGeneral McLernand is so informed. I will see General Halleck as to whether\r\nthe additional force you mention can go with you.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. A. DIX.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., November 18, 1861.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL Dix, Fort Monroe:\r\n\r\nPlease give me your best opinion as to the number of the enemy now at\r\nRichmond and also at Petersburg.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR SHEPLEY.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, November 21, 1862.\r\n\r\nHON. G. F. SHEPLEY.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Dr. Kennedy, bearer of this, has some apprehension that\r\nFederal officers not citizens of Louisiana may be set up as candidates for\r\nCongress in that State. In my view there could be no possible object in\r\nsuch an election. We do not particularly need members of Congress from\r\nthere to enable us to get along with legislation here. What we do want is\r\nthe conclusive evidence that respectable citizens of Louisiana are willing\r\nto be members of Congress and to swear support to the Constitution, and\r\nthat other respectable citizens there are willing to vote for them and\r\nsend them. To send a parcel of Northern men here as representatives,\r\nelected, as would be understood (and perhaps really so), at the point of\r\nthe bayonet, would be disgusting and outrageous; and were I a member of\r\nCongress here, I would vote against admitting any such man to a seat.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER PROHIBITING THE EXPORT OF ARMS AND MUNITIONS OF WAR.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\r\n\r\nNovember 21, 1862.\r\n\r\nOrdered, That no arms, ammunition, or munitions of war be cleared or\r\nallowed to be exported from the United States until further orders. That\r\nany clearance for arms, ammunition, or munitions of war issued heretofore\r\nby the Treasury Department be vacated, if the articles have not passed\r\nwithout the United States, and the articles stopped. That the Secretary\r\nof War hold possession of the arms, etc., recently seized by his order at\r\nRouse's Point, bound for Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDELAYING TACTICS OF GENERALS\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL N. P. BANKS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, November 22, 1862.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GENERAL BANKS:--Early last week you left me in high hope with your\r\nassurance that you would be off with your expedition at the end of that\r\nweek, or early in this. It is now the end of this, and I have just been\r\noverwhelmed and confounded with the sight of a requisition made by you\r\nwhich, I am assured, cannot be filled and got off within an hour short of\r\ntwo months. I enclose you a copy of the requisition, in some hope that\r\nit is not genuine--that you have never seen it. My dear General, this\r\nexpanding and piling up of impedimenta has been, so far, almost our ruin,\r\nand will be our final ruin if it is not abandoned. If you had the articles\r\nof this requisition upon the wharf, with the necessary animals to make\r\nthem of any use, and forage for the animals, you could not get vessels\r\ntogether in two weeks to carry the whole, to say nothing of your twenty\r\nthousand men; and, having the vessels, you could not put the cargoes\r\naboard in two weeks more. And, after all, where you are going you have no\r\nuse for them. When you parted with me you had no such ideas in your mind.\r\nI know you had not, or you could not have expected to be off so soon as\r\nyou said. You must get back to something like the plan you had then, or\r\nyour expedition is a failure before you start. You must be off before\r\nCongress meets. You would be better off anywhere, and especially where\r\nyou are going, for not having a thousand wagons doing nothing but hauling\r\nforage to feed the animals that draw them, and taking at least two\r\nthousand men to care for the wagons and animals, who otherwise might be\r\ntwo thousand good soldiers. Now, dear General, do not think this is an\r\nill-natured letter; it is the very reverse. The simple publication of this\r\nrequisition would ruin you.\r\n\r\nVery truly your friend,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CARL SCHURZ.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, November 24, 1862.\r\n\r\nGENERAL CARL SCHURZ.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR--I have just received and read your letter of the 20th. The\r\npurport of it is that we lost the late elections and the administration\r\nis failing because the war is unsuccessful, and that I must not flatter\r\nmyself that I am not justly to blame for it. I certainly know that if\r\nthe war fails the administration fails, and that I will be blamed for\r\nit, whether I deserve it or not. And I ought to be blamed if I could do\r\nbetter. You think I could do better; therefore you blame me already.\r\nI think I could not do better; therefore I blame you for blaming me. I\r\nunderstand you now to be willing to accept the help of men who are not\r\nRepublicans, provided they have \"heart in it.\" Agreed. I want no others.\r\nBut who is to be the judge of hearts, or of \"heart in it\"? If I must\r\ndiscard my own judgment and take yours, I must also take that of others\r\nand by the time I should reject all I should be advised to reject, I\r\nshould have none left, Republicans or others not even yourself. For be\r\nassured, my dear sir, there are men who have \"heart in it\" that think you\r\nare performing your part as poorly as you think I am performing mine. I\r\ncertainly have been dissatisfied with the slowness of Buell and McClellan;\r\nbut before I relieved them I had great fears I should not find successors\r\nto them who would do better; and I am sorry to add that I have seen little\r\nsince to relieve those fears.\r\n\r\nI do not see clearly the prospect of any more rapid movements. I fear we\r\nshall at last find out that the difficulty is in our case rather than in\r\nparticular generals. I wish to disparage no one certainly not those\r\nwho sympathize with me; but I must say I need success more than I need\r\nsympathy, and that I have not seen the so much greater evidence of getting\r\nsuccess from my sympathizers than from those who are denounced as the\r\ncontrary. It does seem to me that in the field the two classes have been\r\nvery much alike in what they have done and what they have failed to do.\r\nIn sealing their faith with their blood, Baker and Lyon and Bohien and\r\nRichardson, Republicans, did all that men could do; but did they any\r\nmore than Kearny and Stevens and Reno and Mansfield, none of whom were\r\nRepublicans, and some at least of whom have been bitterly and repeatedly\r\ndenounced to me as secession sympathizers? I will not perform the\r\nungrateful task of comparing cases of failure.\r\n\r\nIn answer to your question, \"Has it not been publicly stated in the\r\nnewspapers, and apparently proved as a fact, that from the commencement of\r\nthe war the enemy was continually supplied with information by some of the\r\nconfidential subordinates of as important an officer as Adjutant-General\r\nThomas?\" I must say \"No,\" as far as my knowledge extends. And I add that\r\nif you can give any tangible evidence upon the subject, I will thank you\r\nto come to this city and do so.\r\n\r\nVery truly your friend,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL A. E. BURNSIDE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, November 25, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BURNSIDE, Falmouth, Virginia:\r\n\r\nIf I should be in boat off Aquia Creek at dark tomorrow (Wednesday)\r\nevening, could you, without inconvenience, meet me and pass an hour or two\r\nwith me?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ATTORNEY-GENERAL BATES.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\r\n\r\nNovember 29, 1862.\r\n\r\nHON. ATTORNEY-GENERAL.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Few things perplex me more than this question between\r\nGovernor Gamble and the War Department, as to whether the peculiar force\r\norganized by the former in Missouri are State troops or United States\r\ntroops. Now, this is either an immaterial or a mischievous question.\r\nFirst, if no more is desired than to have it settled what name the force\r\nis to be called by, it is immaterial. Secondly, if it is desired for more\r\nthan the fixing a name, it can only be to get a position from which to\r\ndraw practical inferences; then it is mischievous. Instead of settling one\r\ndispute by deciding the question, I should merely furnish a nest-full of\r\neggs for hatching new disputes. I believe the force is not strictly either\r\n\"State troops\" or \"United States troops.\" It is of mixed character. I\r\ntherefore think it is safer, when a practical question arises, to\r\ndecide that question directly, and not indirectly by deciding a general\r\nabstraction supposed to include it, and also including a great deal more.\r\nWithout dispute Governor Gamble appoints the officers of this force, and\r\nfills vacancies when they occur. The question now practically in dispute\r\nis: Can Governor Gamble make a vacancy by removing an officer or accepting\r\na resignation? Now, while it is proper that this question shall be\r\nsettled, I do not perceive why either Governor Gamble or the government\r\nhere should care which way it is settled. I am perplexed with it only\r\nbecause there seems to be pertinacity about it. It seems to me that it\r\nmight be either way without injury to the service; or that the offer of\r\nthe Secretary of War to let Governor Gamble make vacancies, and he (the\r\nSecretary) to ratify the making of them, ought to be satisfactory.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL CURTIS.\r\n\r\n[Cipher.]\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, November 30, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL CURTIS, Saint Louis, Missouri:\r\n\r\nFrank Blair wants Manter's Thirty-second, Curly's Twenty seventh, Boyd's\r\nTwenty-fourth and the Ninth and Tenth Cavalry to go with him down the\r\nriver. I understand it is with you to decide whether he shall have them\r\nand if so, and if also it is consistent with the public service, you will\r\noblige me a good deal by letting him have them.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON EXECUTING 300 INDIANS\r\n\r\nLETTER TO JUDGE-ADVOCATE-GENERAL.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 1, 1862.\r\n\r\nJUDGE-ADVOCATE-GENERAL.\r\n\r\nSIR:--Three hundred Indians have been sentenced to death in Minnesota by\r\na military commission, and execution only awaits my action. I wish your\r\nlegal opinion whether if I should conclude to execute only a part of them,\r\nI must myself designate which, or could I leave the designation to some\r\nofficer on the ground?\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANNUAL MESSAGE TO CONGRESS, DECEMBER 1, 1862.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES--Since your\r\nlast annual assembling another year of health and bountiful harvests\r\nhas passed; and while it has not pleased the Almighty to bless us with a\r\nreturn of peace, we can but press on, guided by the best light he gives\r\nus, trusting that in his own good time and wise way all will yet be well.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence touching foreign affairs which has taken place during\r\nthe last year is herewith submitted, in virtual compliance with a request\r\nto that effect, made by the House of Representatives near the close of the\r\nlast session of Congress.\r\n\r\nIf the condition of our relations with other nations is less gratifying\r\nthan it has usually been at former periods, it is certainly more\r\nsatisfactory than a nation so unhappily distracted as we are might\r\nreasonably have apprehended. In the month of June last there were some\r\ngrounds to expect that the maritime powers which, at the beginning of\r\nour domestic difficulties, so unwisely and unnecessarily, as we think,\r\nrecognized the insurgents as a belligerent, would soon recede from that\r\nposition, which has proved only less injurious to themselves than to\r\nour own country. But the temporary reverses which afterward befell the\r\nnational arms, and which were exaggerated by our own disloyal citizens\r\nabroad, have hitherto delayed that act of simple justice.\r\n\r\nThe civil war, which has so radically changed, for the moment, the\r\noccupations and habits of the American people, has necessarily disturbed\r\nthe social condition, and affected very deeply the prosperity, of the\r\nnations with which we have carried on a commerce that has been steadily\r\nincreasing throughout a period of half a century. It has, at the same\r\ntime, excited political ambitions and apprehensions which have produced\r\na profound agitation throughout the civilized world. In this unusual\r\nagitation we have forborne from taking part in any controversy between\r\nforeign states, and between parties or factions in such states. We have\r\nattempted no propagandism and acknowledged no revolution, but we have left\r\nto every nation the exclusive conduct and management of its own affairs.\r\nOur struggle has been, of course, contemplated by foreign nations\r\nwith reference less to its own merits than to its supposed and often\r\nexaggerated effects and consequences resulting to those nations\r\nthemselves, nevertheless, complaint on the part of this government, even\r\nif it were just, would certainly be unwise.\r\n\r\nThe treaty with Great Britain for the suppression of the slave trade has\r\nbeen put into operation with a good prospect of complete success. It is\r\nan occasion of special pleasure to acknowledge that the execution of it\r\non the part of her Majesty's government has been marked with a jealous\r\nrespect for the authority of the United States and the rights of their\r\nmoral and loyal citizens.\r\n\r\nThe convention with Hanover for the abolition of the state dues has been\r\ncarried into full effect under the act of Congress for that purpose.\r\n\r\nA blockade of 3000 miles of seacoast could not be established and\r\nvigorously enforced in a season of great commercial activity like\r\nthe present without committing occasional mistakes and inflicting\r\nunintentional injuries upon foreign nations and their subjects.\r\n\r\nA civil war occurring in a country where foreigners reside and carry on\r\ntrade under treaty stipulations is necessarily fruitful of complaints\r\nof the violation of neutral rights. All such collisions tend to excite\r\nmisapprehensions, and possibly to produce mutual reclamations between\r\nnations which have a common interest in preserving peace and friendship.\r\nIn clear cases of these kinds I have so far as possible heard and\r\nredressed complaints which have been presented by friendly powers. There\r\nis still, however, a large and an augmenting number of doubtful cases\r\nupon which the government is unable to agree with the governments whose\r\nprotection is demanded by the claimants. There are, moreover, many cases\r\nin which the United States or their citizens suffer wrongs from the naval\r\nor military authorities of foreign nations which the governments of those\r\nstates are not at once prepared to redress. I have proposed to some of the\r\nforeign states thus interested mutual conventions to examine and adjust\r\nsuch complaints. This proposition has been made especially to Great\r\nBritain, to France, to Spain, and to Prussia. In each case it has been\r\nkindly received, but has not yet been formally adopted.\r\n\r\nI deem it my duty to recommend an appropriation in behalf of the owners of\r\nthe Norwegian bark Admiral P. Tordenskiold, which vessel was in May, 1861,\r\nprevented by the commander of the blockading force off Charleston from\r\nleaving that port with cargo, notwithstanding a similar privilege had\r\nshortly before been granted to an English vessel. I have directed the\r\nSecretary of State to cause the papers in the case to be communicated to\r\nthe proper committees.\r\n\r\nApplications have been made to me by many free Americans of African\r\ndescent to favor their emigration, with a view to such colonization as\r\nwas contemplated in recent acts of Congress, Other parties, at home\r\nand abroad--some from interested motives, others upon patriotic\r\nconsiderations, and still others influenced by philanthropic\r\nsentiments--have suggested similar measures, while, on the other hand,\r\nseveral of the Spanish American republics have protested against the\r\nsending of such colonies to their respective territories. Under these\r\ncircumstances I have declined to move any such colony to any state without\r\nfirst obtaining the consent of its government, with an agreement on its\r\npart to receive and protect such emigrants in all the rights of freemen;\r\nand I have at the same time offered to the several states situated within\r\nthe Tropics, or having colonies there, to negotiate with them, subject to\r\nthe advice and consent of the Senate, to favor the voluntary emigration\r\nof persons of that class to their respective territories, upon conditions\r\nwhich shall be equal, just, and humane. Liberia and Haiti are as yet the\r\nonly countries to which colonists of African descent from here could go\r\nwith certainty of being received and adopted as citizens; and I regret\r\nto say such persons contemplating colonization do not seem so willing to\r\nmigrate to those countries as to some others, nor so willing as I think\r\ntheir interest demands. I believe, however, opinion among them in this\r\nrespect is improving, and that ere long there will be an augmented and\r\nconsiderable migration to both these countries from the United States.\r\n\r\nThe new commercial treaty between the United States and the Sultan of\r\nTurkey has been carried into execution.\r\n\r\nA commercial and consular treaty has been negotiated, subject to the\r\nSenate's consent, with Liberia, and a similar negotiation is now pending\r\nwith the Republic of Haiti. A considerable improvement of the national\r\ncommerce is expected to result from these measures.\r\n\r\nOur relations with Great Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, Russia,\r\nPrussia, Denmark, Sweden, Austria, the Netherlands, Italy, Rome, and the\r\nother European states remain undisturbed. Very favorable relations also\r\ncontinue to be maintained with Turkey, Morocco, China, and Japan.\r\n\r\nDuring the last year there has not only been no change of our previous\r\nrelations with the independent states of our own continent, but more\r\nfriendly sentiments than have heretofore existed are believed to\r\nbe entertained by these neighbors, whose safety and progress are so\r\nintimately connected with our own. This statement especially applies to\r\nMexico, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Honduras, Peru, and Chile.\r\n\r\nThe commission under the convention with the Republic of New Granada\r\nclosed its session without having audited and passed upon all the claims\r\nwhich were submitted to it. A proposition is pending to revive the\r\nconvention, that it may be able to do more complete justice. The joint\r\ncommission between the United States and the Republic of Costa Rica has\r\ncompleted its labors and submitted its report.\r\n\r\nI have favored the project for connecting the United States with Europe by\r\nan Atlantic telegraph, and a similar project to extend the telegraph from\r\nSan Francisco to connect by a Pacific telegraph with the line which is\r\nbeing extended across the Russian Empire.\r\n\r\nThe Territories of the United States, with unimportant exceptions, have\r\nremained undisturbed by the civil war; and they are exhibiting such\r\nevidence of prosperity as justifies an expectation that some of them will\r\nsoon be in a condition to be organized as States and be constitutionally\r\nadmitted into the Federal Union.\r\n\r\nThe immense mineral resources of some of those Territories ought to be\r\ndeveloped as rapidly as possible. Every step in that direction would have\r\na tendency to improve the revenues of the government and diminish the\r\nburdens of the people. It is worthy of your serious consideration whether\r\nsome extraordinary measures to promote that end cannot be adopted. The\r\nmeans which suggests itself as most likely to be effective is a scientific\r\nexploration of the mineral regions in those Territories with a view to the\r\npublication of its results at home and in foreign countries--results which\r\ncannot fail to be auspicious.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the finances win claim your most diligent consideration.\r\nThe vast expenditures incident to the military and naval operations\r\nrequired for the suppression of the rebellion have hitherto been met with\r\na promptitude and certainty unusual in similar circumstances, and the\r\npublic credit has been fully maintained. The continuance of the war,\r\nhowever, and the increased disbursements made necessary by the augmented\r\nforces now in the field demand your best reflections as to the best modes\r\nof providing the necessary revenue without injury to business and with the\r\nleast possible burdens upon labor.\r\n\r\nThe suspension of specie payments by the banks soon after the commencement\r\nof your last session made large issues of United States notes unavoidable.\r\nIn no other way could the payment of troops and the satisfaction of other\r\njust demands be so economically or so well provided for. The judicious\r\nlegislation of Congress, securing the receivability of these notes for\r\nloans and internal duties and making them a legal tender for other debts,\r\nhas made them an universal currency, and has satisfied, partially at\r\nleast, and for the time, the long-felt want of an uniform circulating\r\nmedium, saving thereby to the people immense sums in discounts and\r\nexchanges.\r\n\r\nA return to specie payments, however, at the earliest period compatible\r\nwith due regard to all interests concerned should ever be kept in view.\r\nFluctuations in the value of currency are always injurious, and to reduce\r\nthese fluctuations to the lowest possible point will always be a\r\nleading purpose in wise legislation. Convertibility, prompt and certain\r\nconvertibility, into coin is generally acknowledged to be the best and\r\nsurest safeguard against them; and it is extremely doubtful whether a\r\ncirculation of United States notes payable in coin and sufficiently large\r\nfor the wants of the people can be permanently, usefully, and safely\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nIs there, then, any other mode in which the necessary provision for the\r\npublic wants can be made and the great advantages of a safe and uniform\r\ncurrency secured?\r\n\r\nI know of none which promises so certain results and is at the same time\r\nso unobjectionable as the organization of banking associations, under\r\na general act of Congress, well guarded in its provisions. To such\r\nassociations the government might furnish circulating notes, on the\r\nsecurity of United States bonds deposited in the treasury. These notes,\r\nprepared under the supervision of proper officers, being uniform in\r\nappearance and security and convertible always into coin, would at once\r\nprotect labor against the evils of a vicious currency and facilitate\r\ncommerce by cheap and safe exchanges.\r\n\r\nA moderate reservation from the interest on the bonds would compensate\r\nthe United States for the preparation and distribution of the notes and\r\na general supervision of the system, and would lighten the burden of\r\nthat part of the public debt employed as securities. The public credit,\r\nmoreover, would be greatly improved and the negotiation of new loans\r\ngreatly facilitated by the steady market demand for government bonds which\r\nthe adoption of the proposed system would create.\r\n\r\nIt is an additional recommendation of the measure, of considerable weight,\r\nin my judgment, that it would reconcile as far as possible all existing\r\ninterests by the opportunity offered to existing institutions to\r\nreorganize under the act, substituting only the secured uniform national\r\ncirculation for the local and various circulation, secured and unsecured,\r\nnow issued by them.\r\n\r\nThe receipts into the treasury from all sources, including loans and\r\nbalance from the preceding year, for the fiscal year ending on the 30th\r\nJune, 1862, were $583,885,247.06, of which sum $49,056,397.62 were derived\r\nfrom customs; $1,795,331.73 from the direct tax; from public lands,\r\n$152,203.77; from miscellaneous sources, $931,787.64; from loans in all\r\nforms, $529,692,460.50. The remainder, $2,257,065.80, was the balance from\r\nlast year.\r\n\r\nThe disbursements during the same period were: For congressional,\r\nexecutive, and judicial purposes, $5,939,009.29; for foreign intercourse,\r\n$1,339,710.35; for miscellaneous expenses, including the mints, loans,\r\npost-office deficiencies, collection of revenue, and other like charges,\r\n$14,129,771.50; for expenses under the Interior Department, $3,102,985.52;\r\nunder the War Department, $394,368,407.36; under the Navy Department,\r\n$42,674,569.69; for interest on public debt, $13,190,324.45; and for\r\npayment of public debt, including reimbursement of temporary loan and\r\nredemptions, $96,096,922.09; making an aggregate of $570,841,700.25,\r\nand leaving a balance in the treasury on the 1st day of July, 1862, of\r\n$13,043,546.81.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed that the sum of $96,096,922.09, expended for\r\nreimbursements and redemption of public debt, being included also in the\r\nloans made, may be properly deducted both from receipts and expenditures,\r\nleaving the actual receipts for the year $487,788,324.97, and the\r\nexpenditures $474,744,778.16.\r\n\r\nOther information on the subject of the finances will be found in the\r\nreport of the Secretary of the Treasury, to whose statements and views I\r\ninvite your most candid and considerate attention.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the Secretaries of War and of the Navy are herewith\r\ntransmitted. These reports, though lengthy, are scarcely more than brief\r\nabstracts of the very numerous and extensive transactions and operations\r\nconducted through those departments. Nor could I give a summary of them\r\nhere upon any principle which would admit of its being much shorter than\r\nthe reports themselves. I therefore content myself with laying the reports\r\nbefore you and asking your attention to them.\r\n\r\nIt gives me pleasure to report a decided improvement in the financial\r\ncondition of the Post-Office Department as compared with several preceding\r\nyears. The receipts for the fiscal year 1861 amounted to $8,349,296.40,\r\nwhich embraced the revenue from all the States of the Union for three\r\nquarters of that year. Notwithstanding the cessation of revenue from the\r\nso-called seceded States during the last fiscal year, the increase of\r\nthe correspondence of the loyal States has been sufficient to produce a\r\nrevenue during the same year of $8,299,820.90, being only $50,000 less\r\nthan was derived from all the States of the Union during the previous\r\nyear. The expenditures show a still more favorable result. The amount\r\nexpended in 1861 was $13,606,759.11. For the last year the amount has been\r\nreduced to $11,125,364.13, showing a decrease of about $2,481,000 in the\r\nexpenditures as compared with the preceding year, and about $3,750,000 as\r\ncompared with the fiscal year 1860. The deficiency in the department\r\nfor the previous year was $4,551,966.98. For the last fiscal year it was\r\nreduced to $2,112,814.57. These favorable results are in part owing to the\r\ncessation of mail service in the insurrectionary States and in part to a\r\ncareful review of all expenditures in that department in the interest of\r\neconomy. The efficiency of the postal service, it is believed, has\r\nalso been much improved. The Postmaster-General has also opened a\r\ncorrespondence through the Department of State with foreign governments\r\nproposing a convention of postal representatives for the purpose of\r\nsimplifying the rates of foreign postage and to expedite the foreign\r\nmails. This proposition, equally important to our adopted citizens and to\r\nthe commercial interests of this country, has been favorably entertained\r\nand agreed to by all the governments from whom replies have been received.\r\n\r\nI ask the attention of Congress to the suggestions of the\r\nPostmaster-General in his report respecting the further legislation\r\nrequired, in his opinion, for the benefit of the postal service.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Interior reports as follows in regard to the public\r\nlands:\r\n\r\n\"The public lands have ceased to be a source of revenue. From the 1st\r\nJuly, 1861, to the 30th September, 1862, the entire cash receipts from the\r\nsale of lands were $137,476.2--a sum much less than the expenses of our\r\nland system during the same period. The homestead law, which will take\r\neffect on the 1st of January next, offers such inducements to settlers\r\nthat sales for cash cannot be expected to an extent sufficient to meet the\r\nexpenses of the General Land Office and the cost of surveying and bringing\r\nthe land into market.\"\r\n\r\nThe discrepancy between the sum here stated as arising from the sales of\r\nthe public lands and the sum derived from the same source as reported from\r\nthe Treasury Department arises, as I understand, from the fact that the\r\nperiods of time, though apparently were not really coincident at the\r\nbeginning point, the Treasury report including a considerable sum now\r\nwhich had previously been reported from the Interior, sufficiently large\r\nto greatly overreach the sum derived from the three months now reported\r\nupon by the Interior and not by the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe Indian tribes upon our frontiers have during the past year manifested\r\na spirit of insubordination, and at several points have engaged in open\r\nhostilities against the white settlements in their vicinity. The tribes\r\noccupying the Indian country south of Kansas renounced their allegiance to\r\nthe United States and entered into treaties with the insurgents. Those\r\nwho remained loyal to the United States were driven from the country. The\r\nchief of the Cherokees has visited this city for the purpose of restoring\r\nthe former relations of the tribe with the United States. He alleges that\r\nthey were constrained by superior force to enter into treaties with the\r\ninsurgents, and that the United States neglected to furnish the protection\r\nwhich their treaty stipulations required.\r\n\r\nIn the month of August last the Sioux Indians in Minnesota attacked\r\nthe settlements in their vicinity with extreme ferocity, killing\r\nindiscriminately men, women, and children. This attack was wholly\r\nunexpected, and therefore no means of defense had been provided. It is\r\nestimated that not less than 800 persons were killed by the Indians, and\r\na large amount of property was destroyed. How this outbreak was induced is\r\nnot definitely known, and suspicions, which may be unjust, need not to\r\nbe stated. Information was received by the Indian Bureau from different\r\nsources about the time hostilities were commenced that a simultaneous\r\nattack was to be made upon white settlements by all the tribes between\r\nthe Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains. The State of Minnesota\r\nhas suffered great injury from this Indian war. A large portion of her\r\nterritory has been depopulated, and a severe loss has been sustained\r\nby the destruction of property. The people of that State manifest much\r\nanxiety for the removal of the tribes beyond the limits of the State as\r\na guaranty against future hostilities. The Commissioner of Indian Affairs\r\nwill furnish full details. I submit for your especial consideration\r\nwhether our Indian system shall not be remodeled. Many wise and good men\r\nhave impressed me with the belief that this can be profitably done.\r\n\r\nI submit a statement of the proceedings of commissioners, which shows the\r\nprogress that has been made in the enterprise of constructing the Pacific\r\nRailroad. And this suggests the earliest completion of this road, and also\r\nthe favorable action of Congress upon the projects now pending before them\r\nfor enlarging the capacities of the great canals in New York and Illinois,\r\nas being of vital and rapidly increasing importance to the whole nation,\r\nand especially to the vast interior region hereinafter to be noticed at\r\nsome greater length. I purpose having prepared and laid before you at an\r\nearly day some interesting and valuable statistical information upon this\r\nsubject. The military and commercial importance of enlarging the Illinois\r\nand Michigan Canal and improving the Illinois River is presented in the\r\nreport of Colonel Webster to the Secretary of War, and now transmitted to\r\nCongress. I respectfully ask attention to it.\r\n\r\nTo carry out the provisions of the act of Congress of the 15th of May\r\nlast, I have caused the Department of Agriculture of the United States to\r\nbe organized.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner informs me that within the period of a few months this\r\ndepartment has established an extensive system of correspondence and\r\nexchanges, both at home and abroad, which promises to effect highly\r\nbeneficial results in the development of a correct knowledge of recent\r\nimprovements in agriculture, in the introduction of new products, and in\r\nthe collection of the agricultural statistics of the different States.\r\n\r\nAlso, that it will soon be prepared to distribute largely seeds, cereals,\r\nplants, and cuttings, and has already published and liberally diffused\r\nmuch valuable information in anticipation of a more elaborate report,\r\nwhich will in due time be furnished, embracing some valuable tests in\r\nchemical science now in progress in the laboratory.\r\n\r\nThe creation of this department was for the more immediate benefit of a\r\nlarge class of our most valuable citizens, and I trust that the\r\nliberal basis upon which it has been organized will not only meet your\r\napprobation, but that it will realize at no distant day all the fondest\r\nanticipations of its most sanguine friends and become the fruitful source\r\nof advantage to all our people.\r\n\r\nOn the 22d day of September last a proclamation was issued by the\r\nExecutive, a copy of which is herewith submitted.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the purpose expressed in the second paragraph of that\r\npaper, I now respectfully recall your attention to what may be called\r\n\"compensated emancipation.\"\r\n\r\nA nation may be said to consist of its territory, its people, and its\r\nlaws. The territory is the only part which is of certain durability.\r\n\"One generation passeth away and another generation cometh, but the earth\r\nabideth forever.\" It is of the first importance to duly consider and\r\nestimate this ever enduring part. That portion of the earth's surface\r\nwhich is owned and inhabited by the people of the United States is well\r\nadapted to be the home of one national family, and it is not well\r\nadapted for two or more. Its vast extent and its variety of climate and\r\nproductions are of advantage in this age for one people, whatever they\r\nmight have been in former ages. Steam, telegraphs, and intelligence have\r\nbrought these to be an advantageous combination for one united people.\r\n\r\nIn the inaugural address I briefly pointed out the total inadequacy of\r\ndisunion as a remedy for the differences between the people of the\r\ntwo sections. I did so in language which I cannot improve, and which,\r\ntherefore, I beg to repeat:\r\n\r\n\"One section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to\r\nbe extended, while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be\r\nextended. This is the only substantial dispute. The fugitive-slave clause\r\nof the Constitution and the laws for the suppression of the foreign slave\r\ntrade are each as well enforced, perhaps, as any law can ever be in a\r\ncommunity where the moral Sense of the people imperfectly supports the law\r\nitself. The great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation\r\nin both cases, and a few break over in each. This, I think, cannot be\r\nperfectly cured, and it would be worse in both cases after the separation\r\nof the sections than before. The foreign slave trade, now imperfectly\r\nsuppressed, would be ultimately revived without restriction in one\r\nsection, while fugitive slaves, now only partially surrendered, would not\r\nbe surrendered at all by the other.\r\n\r\n\"Physically speaking, we can not separate. We can not remove our\r\nrespective sections from each other nor build an impassable wall between\r\nthem. A husband and wife may be divorced and go out of the presence and\r\nbeyond the reach of each other, but the different parts of our country\r\ncannot do this. They cannot but remain face to face, and intercourse,\r\neither amicable or hostile, must continue between them. Is it possible,\r\nthen, to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory\r\nafter separation than before? Can aliens make treaties easier than friends\r\ncan make laws? Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens\r\nthan laws can among friends? Suppose you go to war, you cannot fight\r\nalways; and when, after much loss on both sides and no gain on either, you\r\ncease fighting, the identical old questions, as to terms of intercourse,\r\nare again upon you.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no line, straight or crooked, suitable for a national boundary\r\nupon which to divide. Trace through, from east to west, upon the line\r\nbetween the free and slave country, and we shall find a little more than\r\none third of its length are rivers, easy to be crossed, and populated,\r\nor soon to be populated, thickly upon both sides; while nearly all its\r\nremaining length are merely surveyors' lines, over which people may walk\r\nback and forth without any consciousness of their presence. No part of\r\nthis line can be made any more difficult to pass by writing it down on\r\npaper or parchment as a national boundary. The fact of separation, if it\r\ncomes, gives up on the part of the seceding section the fugitive-slave\r\nclause along with all other constitutional obligations upon the section\r\nseceded from, while I should expect no treaty stipulation would ever be\r\nmade to take its place.\r\n\r\nBut there is another difficulty. The great interior region bounded east\r\nby the Alleghenies, north by the British dominions, west by the Rocky\r\nMountains, and south by the line along which the culture of corn and\r\ncotton meets, and which includes part of Virginia, part of Tennessee,\r\nall of Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri,\r\nKansas, Iowa, Minnesota, and the Territories of Dakota, Nebraska, and part\r\nof Colorado, already has above 10,000,000 people, and will have 50,000,000\r\nwithin fifty years if not prevented by any political folly or mistake.\r\nIt contains more than one third of the country owned by the United\r\nStates--certainly more than 1,000,000 square miles. Once half as populous\r\nas Massachusetts already is, it would have more than 75,000,000 people. A\r\nglance at the map shows that, territorially speaking, it is the great\r\nbody of the Republic. The other parts are but marginal borders to it, the\r\nmagnificent region sloping west from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific\r\nbeing the deepest and also the richest in undeveloped resources. In the\r\nproduction of provisions, grains, grasses, and all which proceed from them\r\nthis great interior region is naturally one of the most important in the\r\nworld. Ascertain from statistics the small proportion of the region which\r\nhas yet been brought into cultivation, and also the large and rapidly\r\nincreasing amount of products, and we shall be overwhelmed with\r\nthe magnitude of the prospect presented. And yet this region has no\r\nseacoast--touches no ocean anywhere. As part of one nation, its people\r\nnow find, and may forever find, their way to Europe by New York, to South\r\nAmerica and Africa by New Orleans, and to Asia by San Francisco; but\r\nseparate our common country into two nations, as designed by the present\r\nrebellion, and every man of this great interior region is thereby cut off\r\nfrom some one or more of these outlets, not perhaps by a physical barrier,\r\nbut by embarrassing and onerous trade regulations.\r\n\r\nAnd this is true, wherever a dividing or boundary line may be fixed. Place\r\nit between the now free and slave country, or place it south of Kentucky\r\nor north of Ohio, and still the truth remains that none south of it can\r\ntrade to any port or place north of it, and none north of it can trade to\r\nany port or place south of it, except upon terms dictated by a government\r\nforeign to them. These outlets, east, west, and south, are indispensable\r\nto the well-being of the people inhabiting and to inhabit this vast\r\ninterior region. Which of the three may be the best is no proper question.\r\nAll are better than either, and all of right belong to that people and to\r\ntheir successors forever. True to themselves, they will not ask where a\r\nline of separation shall be, but will vow rather that there shall be no\r\nsuch line.\r\n\r\nNor are the marginal regions less interested in these communications to\r\nand through them to the great outside world. They, too, and each of them,\r\nmust have access to this Egypt of the West without paying toll at the\r\ncrossing of any national boundary.\r\n\r\nOur national strife springs not from our permanent part; not from the land\r\nwe inhabit; not from our national homestead. There is no possible severing\r\nof this but would multiply and not mitigate evils among us. In all its\r\nadaptations and aptitudes it demands union and abhors separation. In fact,\r\nit would ere long force reunion, however much of blood and treasure the\r\nseparation might have cost.\r\n\r\nOur strife pertains to ourselves--to the passing generations of men--and\r\nit can without convulsion be hushed forever with the passing of one\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nIn this view I recommend the adoption of the following resolution and\r\narticles amendatory to the Constitution of the United States:\r\n\r\nResolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States\r\nof America, in Congress assembled, (two thirds of both Houses concurring),\r\nThat the following articles be proposed to the Legislatures (or\r\nconventions) of the several States as amendments to the Constitution of\r\nthe United States, all or any of which articles, when ratified by three\r\nfourths of the said Legislatures (or conventions), to be valid as part or\r\nparts of the said Constitution, viz.\r\n\r\nART.--Every State wherein slavery now exists which shall abolish the same\r\ntherein at any time or times before the 1st day of January, A.D. 1900,\r\nshall receive compensation from the United States as follows, to wit:\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States shall deliver to every such State bonds\r\nof the United States bearing interest at the rate of -- per cent. per\r\nannum to an amount equal to the aggregate sum of ------ for each slave\r\nshown to have been therein by the Eighth Census of the United States, said\r\nbonds to be delivered to such State by instalments or in one parcel at\r\nthe completion of the abolishment, accordingly as the same shall have been\r\ngradual or at one time within such State; and interest shall begin to run\r\nupon any such bond only from the proper time of its delivery as aforesaid.\r\nAny State having received bonds as aforesaid and afterwards reintroducing\r\nor tolerating slavery therein shall refund to the United States the bonds\r\nso received, or the value thereof, and all interest paid thereon.\r\n\r\nART.--All slaves who shall have enjoyed actual freedom by the chances of\r\nthe war at any time before the end of the rebellion shall be forever\r\nfree; but all owners of such who shall not have been disloyal shall be\r\ncompensated for them at the same rates as is provided for States adopting\r\nabolishment of slavery, but in such way that no slave shall be twice\r\naccounted for.\r\n\r\nART.--Congress may appropriate money and otherwise provide for colonizing\r\nfree colored persons with their own consent at any place or places without\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nI beg indulgence to discuss these proposed articles at some length.\r\nWithout slavery the rebellion could never have existed; without slavery it\r\ncould not continue.\r\n\r\nAmong the friends of the Union there is great diversity of sentiment and\r\nof policy in regard to slavery and the African race amongst us. Some\r\nwould perpetuate slavery; some would abolish it suddenly and without\r\ncompensation; some would abolish it gradually and with compensation; some\r\nwould remove the freed people from us, and some would retain them with us;\r\nand there are yet other minor diversities. Because of these diversities we\r\nwaste much strength in struggles among ourselves. By mutual concession we\r\nshould harmonize and act together. This would be compromise, but it would\r\nbe compromise among the friends and not with the enemies of the Union.\r\nThese articles are intended to embody a plan of such mutual concessions.\r\nIf the plan shall be adopted, it is assumed that emancipation will follow,\r\nat least in several of the States.\r\n\r\nAs to the first article, the main points are, first, the emancipation;\r\nsecondly, the length of time for consummating it (thirty-seven years);\r\nand, thirdly, the compensation.\r\n\r\nThe emancipation will be unsatisfactory to the advocates of perpetual\r\nslavery, but the length of time should greatly mitigate their\r\ndissatisfaction. The time spares both races from the evils of sudden\r\nderangement--in fact, from the necessity of any derangement--while most\r\nof those whose habitual course of thought will be disturbed by the measure\r\nwill have passed away before its consummation. They will never see it.\r\nAnother class will hail the prospect of emancipation, but will deprecate\r\nthe length of time. They will feel that it gives too little to the now\r\nliving slaves. But it really gives them much. It saves them from the\r\nvagrant destitution which must largely attend immediate emancipation in\r\nlocalities where their numbers are very great, and it gives the inspiring\r\nassurance that their posterity shall be free forever. The plan leaves to\r\neach State choosing to act under it to abolish slavery now or at the end\r\nof the century, or at any intermediate tune, or by degrees extending\r\nover the whole or any part of the period, and it obliges no two States to\r\nproceed alike. It also provides for compensation, and generally the\r\nmode of making it. This, it would seem, must further mitigate the\r\ndissatisfaction of those who favor perpetual slavery, and especially of\r\nthose who are to receive the compensation. Doubtless some of those who are\r\nto pay and not to receive will object. Yet the measure is both just and\r\neconomical. In a certain sense the liberation of slaves is the destruction\r\nof property--property acquired by descent or by purchase, the same as any\r\nother property. It is no less true for having been often said that the\r\npeople of the South are not more responsible for the original introduction\r\nof this property than are the people of the North; and when it is\r\nremembered how unhesitatingly we all use cotton and sugar and share the\r\nprofits of dealing in them, it may not be quite safe to say that the South\r\nhas been more responsible than the North for its continuance. If, then,\r\nfor a common object this property is to be sacrificed, is it not just that\r\nit be done at a common charge?\r\n\r\nAnd if with less money, or money more easily paid, we can preserve the\r\nbenefits of the Union by this means than we can by the war alone, is it\r\nnot also economical to do it? Let us consider it, then. Let us ascertain\r\nthe sum we have expended in the war Since compensated emancipation\r\nwas proposed last March, and consider whether if that measure had been\r\npromptly accepted by even some of the slave States the same sum would not\r\nhave done more to close the war than has been otherwise done. If so,\r\nthe measure would save money, and in that view would be a prudent and\r\neconomical measure. Certainly it is not so easy to pay something as it is\r\nto pay nothing, but it is easier to pay a large sum than it is to pay a\r\nlarger one. And it is easier to pay any sum when we are able than it is to\r\npay it before we are able. The war requires large sums, and requires\r\nthem at once. The aggregate sum necessary for compensated emancipation of\r\ncourse would be large. But it would require no ready cash, nor the bonds\r\neven any faster than the emancipation progresses. This might not, and\r\nprobably would not, close before the end of the thirty-seven years. At\r\nthat time we shall probably have a hundred millions of people to share the\r\nburden, instead of thirty-one millions as now. And not only so, but the\r\nincrease of our population may be expected to continue for a long time\r\nafter that period as rapidly as before, because our territory will not\r\nhave become full. I do not state this inconsiderately. At the same ratio\r\nof increase which we have maintained, on an average, from our first\r\nnational census, in 1790, until that of 1860, we should in 1900 have a\r\npopulation of 103,208,415. And why may we not continue that ratio far\r\nbeyond that period? Our abundant room, our broad national homestead,\r\nis our ample resource. Were our territory as limited as are the British\r\nIsles, very certainly our population could not expand as stated. Instead\r\nof receiving the foreign born as now, we should be compelled to send part\r\nof the native born away. But such is not our condition. We have 2,963,000\r\nsquare miles. Europe has 3,800,000, with a population averaging 73 persons\r\nto the square mile. Why may not our country at some time average as many?\r\nIs it less fertile? Has it more waste surface by mountains, rivers,\r\nlakes, deserts, or other causes? Is it inferior to Europe in any natural\r\nadvantage? If, then, we are at some time to be as populous as Europe, how\r\nsoon? As to when this may be, we can judge by the past and the present;\r\nas to when it will be, if ever, depends much on whether we maintain the\r\nUnion...............\r\n\r\n          [a page of tables of projected statistics]\r\n\r\nThese figures show that our country may be as populous as Europe now is\r\nat some point between 1920 and 1930, say about 1925--our territory, at 73\r\npersons to the square mile, being of capacity to contain 217,186,000.\r\n\r\nAnd we will reach this, too, if we do not ourselves relinquish the chance\r\nby the folly and evils of disunion or by long and exhausting war springing\r\nfrom the only great element of national discord among us. While it cannot\r\nbe foreseen exactly how much one huge example of secession, breeding\r\nlesser ones indefinitely, would retard population, civilization, and\r\nprosperity, no one can doubt that the extent of it would be very great and\r\ninjurious.\r\n\r\nThe proposed emancipation would shorten the war, perpetuate peace,\r\ninsure this increase of population, and proportionately the wealth of\r\nthe country. With these we should pay all the emancipation would cost,\r\ntogether with our other debt, easier than we should pay our other debt\r\nwithout it. If we had allowed our old national debt to run at six per\r\ncent. per annum, simple interest, from the end of our revolutionary\r\nstruggle until to-day, without paying anything on either principal or\r\ninterest, each man of us would owe less upon that debt now than each man\r\nowed upon it then; and this because our increase of men through the\r\nwhole period has been greater than six per cent.--has run faster than the\r\ninterest upon the debt. Thus time alone relieves a debtor nation, so long\r\nas its population increases faster than unpaid interest accumulates on its\r\ndebt.\r\n\r\nThis fact would be no excuse for delaying payment of what is justly due,\r\nbut it shows the great importance of time in this connection--the great\r\nadvantage of a policy by which we shall not have to pay until we number\r\n100,000,000 what by a different policy we would have to pay now, when\r\nwe number but 31,000,000. In a word, it shows that a dollar will be much\r\nharder to pay for the war than will be a dollar for emancipation on the\r\nproposed plan. And then the latter will cost no blood, no precious life.\r\nIt will be a saving of both.\r\n\r\nAs to the second article, I think it would be impracticable to return\r\nto bondage the class of persons therein contemplated. Some of them,\r\ndoubtless, in the property sense belong to loyal owners, and hence\r\nProvision is made in this article for compensating such.\r\n\r\nThe third article relates to the future of the freed people. It does not\r\noblige, but merely authorizes Congress to aid in colonizing such as may\r\nconsent. This ought nut to be regarded as objectionable on the one hand or\r\non the other, insomuch as it comes to nothing unless by the mutual\r\nconsent of the people to be deported and the American voters through their\r\nrepresentatives in Congress.\r\n\r\nI cannot make it better known than it already is that I strongly favor\r\ncolonization; and yet I wish to say there is an objection urged against\r\nfree colored persons remaining in the country which is largely imaginary,\r\nif not sometimes malicious.\r\n\r\nIt is insisted that their presence would injure and displace white labor\r\nand white laborers. If there ever could be a proper time for mere catch\r\narguments that time surely is not now. In times like the present men\r\nshould utter nothing for which they would not willingly be responsible\r\nthrough time and in eternity. Is it true, then, that colored people can\r\ndisplace any more white labor by being free than by remaining slaves?\r\nIf they stay in their old places, they jostle no white laborers; if they\r\nleave their old places, they leave them open to white laborers. Logically,\r\nthere is neither more nor less of it. Emancipation, even without\r\ndeportation, would probably enhance the wages of white labor, and very\r\nsurely would not reduce them. Thus the customary amount of labor would\r\nstill have to be performed. The freed people would surely not do more than\r\ntheir old proportion of it, and very probably for a time would do less,\r\nleaving an increased part to white laborers, bringing their labor\r\ninto greater demand, and consequently enhancing the wages of it. With\r\ndeportation, even to a limited extent, enhanced wages to white labor\r\nis mathematically certain. Labor is like any other commodity in the\r\nmarket-increase the demand for it and you increase the price of it. Reduce\r\nthe supply of black labor by colonizing the black laborer out of the\r\ncountry, and by precisely so much you increase the demand for and wages of\r\nwhite labor.\r\n\r\nBut it is dreaded that the freed people will swarm forth and cover the\r\nwhole land. Are they not already in the land? Will liberation make them\r\nany more numerous? Equally distributed among the whites of the whole\r\ncountry, and there would be but one colored to seven whites. Could the\r\none in any way greatly disturb the seven? There are many communities now\r\nhaving more than one free colored person to seven whites, and this without\r\nany apparent consciousness of evil from it. The District of Columbia\r\nand the States of Maryland and Delaware are all in this condition. The\r\nDistrict has more than one free colored to six whites, and yet in its\r\nfrequent petitions to Congress I believe it has never presented the\r\npresence of free colored persons as one of its grievances. But why should\r\nemancipation South send the free people North? People of any color seldom\r\nrun unless there be something to run from. Heretofore colored people to\r\nsome extent have fled North from bondage, and now, perhaps, from both\r\nbondage and destitution. But if gradual emancipation and deportation be\r\nadopted, they will have neither to flee from. Their old masters will give\r\nthem wages at least until new laborers can be procured, and the freedmen\r\nin turn will gladly give their labor for the wages till new homes can be\r\nfound for them in congenial climes and with people of their own blood and\r\nrace. This proposition can be trusted on the mutual interests involved.\r\nAnd in any event, cannot the North decide for itself whether to receive\r\nthem?\r\n\r\nAgain, as practice proves more than theory in any case, has there been\r\nany irruption of colored people northward because of the abolishment of\r\nslavery in this District last spring?\r\n\r\nWhat I have said of the proportion of free colored persons to the whites\r\nin the District is from the census of 1860, having no reference to\r\npersons called contrabands nor to those made free by the act of Congress\r\nabolishing slavery here.\r\n\r\nThe plan consisting of these articles is recommended, not but that a\r\nrestoration of the national authority would be accepted without its\r\nadoption.\r\n\r\nNor will the war nor proceedings under the proclamation of September 22,\r\n1862, be stayed because of the recommendation of this plan. Its timely\r\nadoption, I doubt not, would bring restoration, and thereby stay both.\r\n\r\nAnd notwithstanding this plan, the recommendation that Congress provide\r\nby law for compensating any State which may adopt emancipation before this\r\nplan shall have been acted upon is hereby earnestly renewed. Such would be\r\nonly an advance part of the plan, and the same arguments apply to both.\r\n\r\nThis plan is recommended as a means, not in exclusion of, but additional\r\nto, all others for restoring and preserving the national authority\r\nthroughout the Union. The subject is presented exclusively in its\r\neconomical aspect. The plan would, I am confident, secure peace more\r\nspeedily and maintain it more permanently than can be done by force alone,\r\nwhile all it would cost, considering amounts and manner of payment and\r\ntimes of payment, would be easier paid than will be the additional cost of\r\nthe war if we rely solely upon force. It is much, very much, that it would\r\ncost no blood at all.\r\n\r\nThe plan is proposed as permanent constitutional law. It cannot become\r\nsuch without the concurrence of, first, two thirds of Congress, and\r\nafterwards three fourths of the States. The requisite three fourths of\r\nthe States will necessarily include seven of the slave States. Their\r\nconcurrence, if obtained, will give assurance of their severally adopting\r\nemancipation at no very distant day upon the new constitutional terms.\r\nThis assurance would end the struggle now and save the Union forever.\r\n\r\nI do not forget the gravity which should characterize a paper addressed to\r\nthe Congress of the nation by the chief magistrate of the nation, nor do\r\nI forget that some of you are my seniors, nor that many of you have more\r\nexperience than I in the conduct of public affairs. Yet I trust that in\r\nview of the great responsibility resting upon me you will perceive no want\r\nof respect to yourselves in any undue earnestness I may seem to display.\r\n\r\nIs it doubted, then, that the plan I propose, if adopted, would shorten\r\nthe war, and thus lessen its expenditure of money and of blood? Is\r\nit doubted that it would restore the national authority and national\r\nprosperity and perpetuate both indefinitely? Is it doubted that we\r\nhere--Congress and executive--can secure its adoption? Will not the good\r\npeople respond to a united and earnest appeal from us? Can we, can they,\r\nby any other means so certainly or so speedily assure these vital objects?\r\nWe can succeed only by concert. It is not \"Can any of us imagine better?\"\r\nbut \"Can we all do better?\" Object whatsoever is possible, still the\r\nquestion recurs, \"Can we do better?\" The dogmas of the quiet past\r\nare inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with\r\ndifficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we\r\nmust think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we\r\nshall save our country.\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens, we can not escape history. We of this Congress and this\r\nadministration will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No personal\r\nsignificance or insignificance can spare one or another of us. The fiery\r\ntrial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the\r\nlatest generation. We say we are for the Union. The world will not forget\r\nthat we say this. We know how to save the Union. The world knows we\r\ndo know how to save it. We, even we here, hold the power and bear the\r\nresponsibility. In giving freedom to the slave we assure freedom to the\r\nfree--honorable alike in what we give and what we preserve. We shall nobly\r\nsave or meanly lose the last, best hope of earth. Other means may succeed;\r\nthis could not fail. The way is plain, peaceful, generous, just--a way\r\nwhich if followed the world will forever applaud and God must forever\r\nbless.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, December 3, 1862.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of November, 1861, a collision took place off the coast of Cuba\r\nbetween the United States war steamer San Jacinto and the French brig\r\nJules et Marie, resulting in serious damage to the latter. The obligation\r\nof this Government to make amends therefor could not be questioned if the\r\ninjury resulted from any fault On the part of the San Jacinto. With a view\r\nto ascertain this, the subject was referred to a commission of the United\r\nStates and French naval officers at New York, with a naval officer of\r\nItaly as an arbiter. The conclusion arrived at was that the collision was\r\noccasioned by the failure of the San Jacinto seasonably to reverse\r\nher engine. It then became necessary to ascertain the amount of\r\nindemnification due to the injured party. The United States consul-general\r\nat Havana was consequently instructed to confer with the consul of France\r\non this point, and they have determined that the sum of $9,500 is an\r\nequitable allowance under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nI recommend an appropriation of this sum for the benefit of the owners of\r\nthe Jules et Marie.\r\n\r\nA copy of the letter of Mr. Shufeldt, the consul-general of the United\r\nStates at Havana, to the Secretary of State on the subject is herewith\r\ntransmitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

Strickland is here asking authority to raise a regiment of\r\nTennesseeans. Would you advise that the authority be given him?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS. December 8, 1862.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nIn conformity to the law of July 16, 1862, I most cordially recommend,\r\nthat Commander John L. Worden, United States Navy, receive a vote of\r\nthanks of Congress for the eminent skill and gallantry exhibited by him\r\nin the late remarkable battle between the United States ironclad steamer\r\nMonitor, under his command, and the rebel ironclad steamer Merrimac, in\r\nMarch last.\r\n\r\nThe thanks of Congress for his services on the occasion referred to were\r\ntendered by a resolution approved July 11, 1862, but the recommendation is\r\nnow specially made in order to comply with the requirements of the ninth\r\nsection of the act of July 16, 1862, which is in the following words,\r\nviz.:\r\n\r\n\"That any line officer of the navy or marine corps may be advanced one\r\ngrade if upon recommendation of the President by name he receives the\r\nthanks of Congress for highly distinguished conduct in conflict with the\r\nenemy or for extraordinary heroism in the line of his profession.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL S. R. CURTIS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\r\n\r\nDecember 10, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL CURTIS, St. Louis, Missouri:\r\n\r\nPlease suspend, until further order, all proceeding on the order made by\r\nGeneral Schofield, on the twenty-eighth day of August last, for assessing\r\nand collecting from secessionists and Southern sympathizers the sum of\r\nfive hundred thousand dollars, etc., and in the meantime make out and\r\nsend me a statement of facts pertinent to the question, together with your\r\nopinion upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. K. DUBOIS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\r\n\r\nDecember 10, 1862.\r\n\r\nHon. J. K. DuBois.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--In the summer of 1859, when Mr. Freeman visited Springfield,\r\nIllinois, in relation to the McCallister and Stebbins bonds I promised him\r\nthat, upon certain conditions, I would ask members of the Legislature to\r\ngive him a full and fair hearing of his case. I do not now remember, nor\r\nhave I time to recall, exactly what the conditions were, nor whether they\r\nwere completely performed; but there can be in no case any harm [in] his\r\nhaving a full and fair hearing, and I sincerely wish it may be given him.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE SENATE.\r\n\r\nDecember 11, 1862.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with your resolution of December 5, 1862, requesting the\r\nPresident \"to furnish the Senate with all information in his possession\r\ntouching the late Indian barbarities in the State of Minnesota, and also\r\nthe evidence in his possession upon which some of the principal actors\r\nand head men were tried and condemned to death,\" I have the honor to\r\nstate that on receipt of said resolution, I transmitted the same to the\r\nSecretary of the Interior, accompanied by a note, a copy of which is\r\nherewith inclosed, marked A, and in response to which I received, through\r\nthat department, a letter of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, a copy of\r\nwhich is herewith inclosed, marked B.\r\n\r\nI further state that on the eighth day of November last I received a long\r\ntelegraphic despatch from Major-General Pope, at St. Paul, Minnesota,\r\nsimply announcing the names of the persons sentenced to be hanged. I\r\nimmediately telegraphed to have transcripts of the records in all cases\r\nforwarded to me, which transcripts, however, did not reach me until two\r\nor three days before the present meeting of Congress. Meantime I received,\r\nthrough telegraphic despatches and otherwise, appeals in behalf of the\r\ncondemned, appeals for their execution, and expressions of opinion as to\r\nthe proper policy in regard to them and to the Indians generally in that\r\nvicinity, none of which, as I understand, falls within the scope of your\r\ninquiry. After the arrival of the transcripts of records, but before I had\r\nsufficient opportunity to examine them, I received a joint letter from\r\none of the senators and two of the representatives from Minnesota, which\r\ncontains some statements of fact not found in the records of the trials,\r\nand for which reason I herewith transmit a copy, marked C. I also, for\r\nthe same reason, inclose a printed memorial of the citizens of St. Paul,\r\naddressed to me, and forwarded with the letter aforesaid.\r\n\r\nAnxious to not act with so much clemency as to encourage another outbreak\r\non the one hand, nor with so much severity as to be real cruelty on the\r\nother, I caused a careful examination of the records of trials to be made,\r\nin view of first ordering the execution of such as had been proved guilty\r\nof violating females. Contrary to my expectation, only two of this class\r\nwere found. I then directed a further examination and a classification of\r\nall who were proven to have participated in massacres, as distinguished\r\nfrom participation in battles. This class numbered forty, and included\r\nthe two convicted of female violation. One of the number is strongly\r\nrecommended, by the commission which tried them, for commutation to ten\r\nyears imprisonment I have ordered the other thirty-nine to be executed on\r\nFriday the 19th instant. The order was despatched from here on Monday, the\r\n8th instant, by a messenger to General Sibley, and a copy of which order\r\nis herewith transmitted, marked D.\r\n\r\nAn abstract of the evidence as to the forty is herewith inclosed, marked\r\nE.\r\n\r\nTo avoid the immense amount of copying, I lay before the Senate the\r\noriginal transcripts of the records of trials, as received by me.\r\n\r\nThis is as full and complete a response to the resolution as it is in my\r\npower to make.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nDecember 12, 1862.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nI have in my possession three valuable swords, formerly the property of\r\nGeneral David E. Twiggs, which I now place at the disposal of Congress.\r\nThey are forwarded to me from New Orleans by Major-General Benjamin F.\r\nButler. If they or any of them shall be by Congress disposed of in reward\r\nor compliment of military service, I think General Butler is entitled to\r\nthe first consideration. A copy of the General's letter to me accompanying\r\nthe swords is herewith transmitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO FERNANDO WOOD.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON DECEMBER 12, 1862.\r\n\r\nHON. FERNANDO WOOD.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Your letter of the 8th, with the accompanying note of same\r\ndate, was received yesterday. The most important paragraph in the letter,\r\nas I consider, is in these words:\r\n\r\n\"On the 25th of November last I was advised by an authority which I deemed\r\nlikely to be well informed, as well as reliable and truthful, that the\r\nSouthern States would send representatives to the next Congress, provided\r\nthat a full and general amnesty should permit them to do so. No guarantee\r\nor terms were asked for other than the amnesty referred to.\"\r\n\r\nI strongly suspect your information will prove to be groundless;\r\nnevertheless, I thank you for communicating it to me. Understanding the\r\nphrase in the paragraph just quoted--\"the Southern States would send\r\nrepresentatives to the next Congress\"--to be substantially the same as\r\nthat \"the people of the Southern States would cease resistance, and would\r\nreinaugurate, submit to, and maintain the national authority within the\r\nlimits of such States, under the Constitution of the United States,\" I say\r\nthat in such case the war would cease on the part of the United States;\r\nand that if within a reasonable time \"a full and general amnesty\" were\r\nnecessary to such end, it would not be withheld.\r\n\r\nI do not think it would be proper now to communicate this, formally or\r\ninformally, to the people of the Southern States. My belief is that they\r\nalready know it; and when they choose, if ever, they can communicate\r\nwith me unequivocally. Nor do I think it proper now to suspend military\r\noperations to try any experiment of negotiation.\r\n\r\nI should nevertheless receive with great pleasure the exact information\r\nyou now have, and also such other as you may in any way obtain. Such\r\ninformation might be more valuable before the 1st of January than\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nWhile there is nothing in this letter which I shall dread to see in\r\nhistory, it is, perhaps, better for the present that its existence should\r\nnot become public. I therefore have to request that you will regard it as\r\nconfidential.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL CURTIS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 14, 1862\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL CURTIS, St. Louis, Missouri:\r\n\r\nIf my friend Dr. William Fithian, of Danville, Ill., should call on YOU,\r\nplease give him such facilities as you consistently can about recovering\r\nthe remains of a step-son, and matters connected therewith.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL H. H. SIBLEY.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 16, 1862.\r\n\r\nBRIG. GEN. H. H. SIBLEY, Saint Paul, Minn.:\r\n\r\nAs you suggest, let the executions fixed for Friday the 19th instant be\r\npostponed to, and be done on, Friday the 26th instant.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN. (Private.)

CHASE.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:--You have respectively tendered me your resignations as\r\nSecretary of State and Secretary of the Treasury of the United States. I\r\nam apprised of the circumstances which may render this course personally\r\ndesirable to each of you; but after most anxious consideration my\r\ndeliberate judgment is that the public interest does not admit of it.\r\nI therefore have to request that you will resume the duties of your\r\ndepartments respectively.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR ANDREW.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.

William Kellogg has just been\r\nshown me. You can scarcely overestimate the pleasure it would give me to\r\noblige you, but nothing is operating so ruinously upon us everywhere as\r\n\"absenteeism.\" It positively will not do for me to grant leaves of absence\r\nin cases not sufficient to procure them under the regular rules.\r\n\r\nIt would astonish you to know the extent of the evil of \"absenteeism.\" We\r\nscarcely have more than half the men we are paying on the spot for service\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONGRATULATIONS TO THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\r\n\r\nDecember 22, 1862.\r\n\r\nTO THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC:\r\n\r\nI have just read your general's report of the battle of Fredericksburg.\r\nAlthough you were not successful, the attempt was not an error, nor the\r\nfailure other than accident. The courage with which you, in an open field,\r\nmaintained the contest against an intrenched foe, and the consummate skill\r\nand success with which you crossed and recrossed the river in the face of\r\nthe enemy, show that you possess all the qualities of a great army,\r\nwhich will yet give victory to the cause of the country and of popular\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nCondoling with the mourners for the dead, and sympathizing with\r\nthe severely wounded, I congratulate you that the number of both is\r\ncomparatively so small.\r\n\r\nI tender to you, officers and soldiers, the thanks of the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER OF CONDOLENCE\r\n\r\nTO MISS FANNY McCULLOUGH.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December, 23, 1862.\r\n\r\nDEAR FANNY:--It is with deep regret that I learn of the death of your kind\r\nand brave father, and especially that it is affecting your young heart\r\nbeyond what is common in such cases. In this sad world of ours sorrow\r\ncomes to all, and to the young it comes with bittered agony because it\r\ntakes them unawares.\r\n\r\nThe older have learned ever to expect it. I am anxious to afford some\r\nalleviation of your present distress, perfect relief is not possible,\r\nexcept with time. You cannot now realize that you will ever feel better.\r\nIs not this so? And yet it is a mistake. You are sure to be happy again.\r\nTo know this, which is certainly true, will make you some less miserable\r\nnow. I have had experience enough to know what I say, and you need only to\r\nbelieve it to feel better at once. The memory of your dear father, instead\r\nof an agony, will yet be a sad, sweet feeling in your heart, of a purer\r\nand holier sort than you have known before.\r\n\r\nPlease present my kind regards to your afflicted mother.\r\n\r\nYour sincere friend,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 26, 1862\r\n\r\nHONORABLE SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nSir:--Two Ohio regiments and one Illinois regiment which were captured at\r\nHartsville have been paroled and are now at Columbus, Ohio. This brings\r\nthe Ohio regiments substantially to their homes. I am strongly impressed\r\nwith the belief that the Illinois regiment better be sent to Illinois,\r\nwhere it will be recruited and put in good condition by the time they are\r\nexchanged so as to re-enter the service. They did not misbehave, as I\r\nam satisfied, so that they should receive no treatment nor have anything\r\nwithheld from them by way of punishment.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL CURTIS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 27, 1862.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL CURTIS, Saint Louis, Mo.:\r\n\r\nLet the order in regard to Dr. McPheeters and family be suspended until\r\nyou hear from me.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

If in\r\nsuch a difficulty as this you do not help, you fail me precisely in the\r\npoint for which I sought your assistance You know what General Burnside's\r\nplan is, and it is my wish that you go with him to the ground, examine it\r\nas far as practicable, confer with the officers, getting their judgment,\r\nand ascertaining their temper--in a word, gather all the elements for\r\nforming a judgment of your own, and then tell General Burnside that you\r\ndo approve or that you do not approve his plan. Your military skill is\r\nuseless to me if you will not do this.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n[Indorsement]\r\n\r\nJanuary 1, 1863 Withdrawn, because considered harsh by General Halleck.\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, January 2, 1863\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nI submit to Congress the expediency of extending to other departments\r\nof the government the authority conferred on the President by the eighth\r\nsection of the act of the 8th of May, 1792, to appoint a person to\r\ntemporarily discharge the duties of Secretary of State, Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, and Secretary of War, in case of the death, absence from the\r\nseat of government, or sickness of either of those officers.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL S. R. CURTIS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON JANUARY 2, 1863\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL CURTIS.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Yours of December 29 by the hand of Mr. Strong is just\r\nreceived. The day I telegraphed you suspending the order in relation to\r\nDr. McPheeters, he, with Mr. Bates, the Attorney-General, appeared before\r\nme and left with me a copy of the order mentioned. The doctor also showed\r\nme the Copy of an oath which he said he had taken, which is indeed very\r\nstrong and specific. He also verbally assured me that he had constantly\r\nprayed in church for the President and government, as he had always done\r\nbefore the present war. In looking over the recitals in your order, I do\r\nnot see that this matter of the prayer, as he states it, is negatived,\r\nnor that any violation of his oath is charged nor, in fact, that anything\r\nspecific is alleged against him. The charges are all general: that he has\r\na rebel wife and rebel relations, that he sympathies with rebels, and\r\nthat he exercises rebel influence. Now, after talking with him, I tell\r\nyou frankly I believe he does sympathize with the rebels, but the question\r\nremains whether such a man, of unquestioned good moral character, who has\r\ntaken such an oath as he has, and cannot even be charged with violating\r\nit, and who can be charged with no other specific act or omission, can,\r\nwith safety to the government, be exiled upon the suspicion of his secret\r\nsympathies. But I agree that this must be left to you, who are on the\r\nspot; and if, after all, you think the public good requires his removal,\r\nmy suspension of the order is withdrawn, only with this qualification,\r\nthat the time during the suspension is not to be counted against him. I\r\nhave promised him this. But I must add that the United States Government\r\nmust not, as by this order, undertake to run the churches. When an\r\nindividual in a church or out of it becomes dangerous to the public\r\ninterest, he must be checked; but let the churches, as such, take care\r\nof themselves. It will not do for the United States to appoint trustees,\r\nsupervisors, or other agents for the churches.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nP. S.--The committee composed of Messrs. Yeatman and Filley (Mr. Broadhead\r\nnot attending) has presented your letter and the memorial of sundry\r\ncitizens. On the whole subject embraced exercise your best judgment,\r\nwith a sole view to the public interest, and I will not interfere without\r\nhearing you.\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN., January 3, 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY WELLES.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 4, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. GIDEON WELLES, Secretary of the Navy.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--As many persons who come well recommended for loyalty and\r\nservice to the Union cause, and who are refugees from rebel oppression in\r\nthe State of Virginia, make application to me for authority and permission\r\nto remove their families and property to protection within the Union\r\nlines, by means of our armed gunboats on the Potomac River and Chesapeake\r\nBay, you are hereby requested to hear and consider all such applications,\r\nand to grant such assistance to this class of persons as in your judgment\r\ntheir merits may render proper, and as may in each case be consistent with\r\nthe perfect and complete efficiency of the naval service and with military\r\nexpediency.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL S. L CURTIS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 5, 1863\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL CURTIS.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I am having a good deal of trouble with Missouri matters,\r\nand I now sit down to write you particularly about it. One class of\r\nfriends believe in greater severity and another in greater leniency in\r\nregard to arrests, banishments, and assessments. As usual in such cases,\r\neach questions the other's motives. On the one hand, it is insisted that\r\nGovernor Gamble's unionism, at most, is not better than a secondary spring\r\nof action; that hunkerism and a wish for political influence stand\r\nbefore Unionism with him. On the other hand, it is urged that arrests,\r\nbanishments, and assessments are made more for private malice, revenge,\r\nand pecuniary interest than for the public good. This morning I was told,\r\nby a gentleman who I have no doubt believes what he says, that in one\r\ncase of assessments for $10,000 the different persons who paid compared\r\nreceipts, and found they had paid $30,000. If this be true, the inference\r\nis that the collecting agents pocketed the odd $20,000. And true or not\r\nin the instance, nothing but the sternest necessity can justify the\r\nmaking and maintaining of a system so liable to such abuses. Doubtless the\r\nnecessity for the making of the system in Missouri did exist, and whether\r\nit continues for the maintenance of it is now a practical and very\r\nimportant question. Some days ago Governor Gamble telegraphed me, asking\r\nthat the assessments outside of St. Louis County might be suspended, as\r\nthey already have been within it, and this morning all the members of\r\nCongress here from Missouri but one laid a paper before me asking the same\r\nthing. Now, my belief is that Governor Gamble is an honest and true man,\r\nnot less so than yourself; that you and he could confer together on this\r\nand other Missouri questions with great advantage to the public; that each\r\nknows something which the other does not; and that acting together you\r\ncould about double your stock of pertinent information. May I not hope\r\nthat you and he will attempt this? I could at once safely do (or you could\r\nsafely do without me) whatever you and he agree upon. There is absolutely\r\nno reason why you should not agree.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nP. S.--I forgot to say that Hon. James S. Rollins, member of Congress\r\nfrom one of the Missouri districts, wishes that, upon his personal\r\nresponsibility, Rev. John M. Robinson, of Columbia, Missouri; James L.\r\nMatthews, of Boone County, Missouri; and James L. Stephens, also of Boone\r\nCounty, Missouri, may be allowed to return to their respective homes.\r\nMajor Rollins leaves with me very strong papers from the neighbors of\r\nthese men, whom he says he knows to be true men. He also says he has many\r\nconstituents who he thinks are rightly exiled, but that he thinks these\r\nthree should be allowed to return. Please look into the case, and oblige\r\nMajor Rollins if you consistently can.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n[Copy sent to Governor Gamble.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CALEB RUSSELL AND SALLIE A. FENTON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 5, 1863.\r\n\r\nMY GOOD FRIENDS: The Honorable Senator Harlan has just placed in my hands\r\nyour letter of the 27th of December, which I have read with pleasure and\r\ngratitude.\r\n\r\nIt is most cheering and encouraging for me to know that in the efforts\r\nwhich I have made and am making for the restoration of a righteous peace\r\nto our country, I am upheld and sustained by the good wishes and prayers\r\nof God's people. No one is more deeply than myself aware that without His\r\nfavor our highest wisdom is but as foolishness and that our most strenuous\r\nefforts would avail nothing in the shadow of His displeasure.\r\n\r\nI am conscious of no desire for my country's welfare that is not in\r\nconsonance with His will, and of no plan upon which we may not ask His\r\nblessing. It seems to me that if there be one subject upon which all good\r\nmen may unitedly agree, it is imploring the gracious favor of the God of\r\nNations upon the struggles our people are making for the preservation of\r\ntheir precious birthright of civil and religious liberty.\r\n\r\nVery truly your friend;\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL ROSECRANS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 5. 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL W. S. ROSECRANS, Murfreesborough, Tenn.: Your despatch\r\nannouncing retreat of enemy has just reached here. God bless you and all\r\nwith you! Please tender to all, and accept for yourself, the nation's\r\ngratitude for your and their skill, endurance, and dauntless courage.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON January 7, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--What think you of forming a reserve cavalry corps of, say,\r\n6000 for the Army of the Potomac? Might not such a corps be constituted\r\nfrom the cavalry of Sigel's and Slocum's corps, with scraps we could pick\r\nup here and there?\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO B. G. BROWN.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., January 7, 1863. 5.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nHON. B. GRATZ BROWN, Jefferson City, Mo.:\r\n\r\nYours of to-day just received. The administration takes no part between\r\nits friends in Missouri, of whom I, at least, consider you one; and I have\r\nnever before had an intimation that appointees there were interfering, or\r\nwere inclined to interfere.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORRESPONDENCE WITH GENERAL A. E. BURNSIDE, JANUARY 8, 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC January 5, 1863.\r\n\r\nHIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nSince my return to the army I have become more than ever convinced that\r\nthe general officers of this command are almost unanimously opposed to\r\nanother crossing of the river; but I am still of the opinion that the\r\ncrossing should be attempted, and I have accordingly issued orders to the\r\nengineers and artillery to prepare for it. There is much hazard in it, as\r\nthere always is in the majority of military movements, and I cannot begin\r\nthe movement without giving you notice of it, particularly as I know so\r\nlittle of the effect that it may have upon other movements of distant\r\narmies.\r\n\r\nThe influence of your telegram the other day is still upon me, and has\r\nimpressed me with the idea that there are many parts of the problem which\r\ninfluence you that are not known to me.\r\n\r\nIn order to relieve you from all embarrassment in my case, I inclose with\r\nthis my resignation of my commission as major-general of volunteers, which\r\nyou can have accepted if my movement is not in accordance with the views\r\nof yourself and your military advisers.\r\n\r\nI have taken the liberty to write to you personally upon this subject,\r\nbecause it was necessary, as I learned from General Halleck, for you to\r\napprove of my general plan, written at Warrenton, before I could commence\r\nthe movement; and I think it quite as necessary that you should know of\r\nthe important movement I am about to make, particularly as it will have to\r\nbe made in opposition to the views of nearly all my general officers, and\r\nafter the receipt of a despatch from you informing me of the opinion of\r\nsome of them who had visited you.\r\n\r\nIn conversation with you on New Year's morning I was led to express some\r\nopinions which I afterward felt it my duty to place on paper, and to\r\nexpress them verbally to the gentleman of whom we were speaking, which I\r\ndid in your presence, after handing you the letter. You were not disposed\r\nthen, as I saw, to retain the letter, and I took it back, but I now return\r\nit to you for record if you wish it.\r\n\r\nI beg leave to say that my resignation is not sent in in any spirit of\r\ninsubordination, but, as I before said, simply to relieve you from any\r\nembarrassment in changing commanders where lack of confidence may have\r\nrendered it necessary.\r\n\r\nThe bearer of this will bring me any answer, or I should be glad to hear\r\nfrom you by telegraph in cipher.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nA. E. BURNSIDE,\r\n\r\nMajor-General, Commanding Army of the Potomac.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, WASHINGTON, January 7, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BURNSIDE, Commanding, etc., Falmouth:\r\n\r\nGENERAL:--Your communication of the 5th was delivered to me by your\r\naide-de-camp at 12 M. to-day.\r\n\r\nIn all my communications and interviews with you since you took command\r\nof the Army of the Potomac I have advised a forward movement across the\r\nRappahannock. At our interview at Warrenton I urged that you should cross\r\nby the fords above Fredericksburg rather than to fall down to that\r\nplace; and when I left you at Warrenton it was understood that at least\r\na considerable part of your army would cross by the fords, and I so\r\nrepresented to the President. It was this modification of the plan\r\nproposed by you that I telegraphed you had received his approval. When\r\nthe attempt at Fredericksburg was abandoned, I advised you to renew the\r\nattempt at some other point, either in whole or in part, to turn the\r\nenemy's works, or to threaten their wings or communications; in other\r\nwords, to keep the enemy occupied till a favorable opportunity offered to\r\nstrike a decisive blow. I particularly advised you to use your cavalry\r\nand light artillery upon his communications, and attempt to cut off his\r\nsupplies and engage him at an advantage.\r\n\r\nIn all our interviews I have urged that our first object was, not\r\nRichmond, but the defeat or scattering of Lee's army, which threatened\r\nWashington and the line of the upper Potomac. I now recur to these things\r\nsimply to remind you of the general views which I have expressed, and\r\nwhich I still hold.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of the case, however, have somewhat changed since the\r\nearly part of November. The chances of an extended line of operations\r\nare now, on account of the advanced season, much less than then. But\r\nthe chances are still in our favor to meet and defeat the enemy on the\r\nRappahannock, if we can effect a crossing in a position where we can meet\r\nthe enemy on favorable or even equal terms. I therefore still advise a\r\nmovement against him. The character of that movement, however, must depend\r\nupon circumstances which may change any day and almost any hour. If the\r\nenemy should concentrate his forces at the place you have selected for a\r\ncrossing, make it a feint and try another place. Again, the circumstances\r\nat the time may be such as to render an attempt to cross the entire\r\narmy not advisable. In that case, theory suggests that, while the enemy\r\nconcentrates at that point, advantages can be gained by crossing smaller\r\nforces at other points to cut off his lines, destroy his communication,\r\nand capture his rear-guards, outposts, etc. The great object is to occupy\r\nthe enemy to prevent his making large detachments or distant raids, and to\r\ninjure him all you can with the least injury to yourself. If this can\r\nbe best accomplished by feints of a general crossing and detached real\r\ncrossings, take that course; if by an actual general crossing, with feints\r\non other points, adopt that course. There seem to me to be many reasons\r\nwhy a crossing at some point should be attempted. It will not do to keep\r\nyour large army inactive. As you yourself admit, it devolves on you to\r\ndecide upon the time, place, and character of the crossing which you\r\nmay attempt. I can only advise that an attempt be made, and as early as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nH. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Indorsement.]\r\n\r\nJanuary 8, 1863.\r\n\r\nGENERAL BURNSIDE:\r\n\r\nI understand General Halleck has sent you a letter of which this is a\r\ncopy. I approve this letter. I deplore the want of concurrence with you\r\nin opinion by your general officers, but I do not see the remedy. Be\r\ncautious, and do not understand that the government or country is driving\r\nyou. I do not yet see how I could profit by changing the command of the\r\nArmy of the Potomac; and if I did, I should not wish to do it by accepting\r\nthe resignation of your commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 8, 1863.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR JOHNSON, Nashville Tenn.:\r\n\r\nA dispatch of yesterday from Nashville says the body of Captain Todd, of\r\nthe Sixth Kentucky, was brought in to-day.\r\n\r\nPlease tell me what was his Christian name, and whether he was in our\r\nservice or that of the enemy. I shall also be glad to have your impression\r\nas to the effect the late operations about Murfreesborough will have on\r\nthe prospects of Tennessee.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

I presume the remains of Captain Todd are in the hands of\r\nhis family and friends, and I wish to give no order on the subject; but\r\nI do wish your opinion of the effects of the late battles about\r\nMurfreesborough upon the prospects of Tennessee.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTION TO THE JUDGE-ADVOCATE-GENERAL.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, January 12, 1863.\r\n\r\nThe Judge-Advocate-General is instructed to revise the proceedings of the\r\ncourt-martial in the case of Major-General Fitz-John Porter, and to report\r\nfully upon any legal questions that may have arisen in them, and upon the\r\nbearing of the testimony in reference to the charges and specifications\r\nexhibited against the accused, and upon which he was tried.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. JANUARY 14, 1863.\r\n\r\nTO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: The Secretary of State has submitted to\r\nme a resolution of the House of Representatives of the 5th instant, which\r\nhas been delivered to him, and which is in the following words:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the Secretary of State be requested to communicate to this\r\nHouse, if not, in his judgment, incompatible with the public interest,\r\nwhy our Minister in New Granada has not presented his credentials to\r\nthe actual government of that country; also the reasons for which\r\nSenor Murillo is not recognized by the United States as the diplomatic\r\nrepresentative of the Mosquera government of that country; also,\r\nwhat negotiations have been had, if any, with General Herran as the\r\nrepresentative of Ospina's government in New Granada since it went into\r\nexistence.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 12th day of December, 1846, a treaty of amity, peace, and concord\r\nwas concluded between the United States of America and the Republic of\r\nNew Granada, which is still in force. On the 7th day of December, 1847,\r\nGeneral Pedro Alcantara Herran, who had been duly accredited, was received\r\nhere as the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of that,\r\nrepublic. On the 30th day of August, 1849, Senor Don Rafael Rivas was\r\nreceived by this government as charge d'affaires of the same republic. On\r\nthe 5th day of December, 1851, a consular convention was concluded between\r\nthat republic and the United States, which treaty was signed on behalf of\r\nthe Republic of Granada by the same Senor Rivas. This treaty is still in\r\nforce. On the 27th of April, 1852, Senor Don Victoriano de Diego Paredes\r\nwas received as charge d'affaires of the Republic of New Granada. On the\r\n20th of June, 1855, General Pedro Alcantara Herran was again received as\r\nenvoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary, duly accredited by the\r\nRepublic of New Granada, and he has ever since remained, under the same\r\ncredentials, as the representative of that republic near the Government of\r\nthe United States. On the 10th of September, 1857, a claims convention\r\nwas concluded between the United States and the Republic of Granada. This\r\nconvention is still in force, and has in part been executed. In May, 1858,\r\nthe constitution of the republic was remodelled; and the nation assumed\r\nthe political title of \"The Granadian Confederacy.\" This fact was\r\nformally announced to this Government, but without any change in\r\ntheir representative here. Previously to the 4th day of March, 1861, a\r\nrevolutionary war against the Republic of New Granada, which had thus\r\nbeen recognized and treated with by the United States, broke out in New\r\nGranada, assuming to set up a new government under the name of \"United\r\nStates of Colombia.\" This war has had various vicissitudes, sometimes\r\nfavorable, sometimes adverse, to the revolutionary movements. The\r\nrevolutionary organization has hitherto been simply a military\r\nprovisionary power, and no definitive constitution of government has\r\nyet been established in New Granada in place of that organized by the\r\nconstitution of 1858. The minister of the United States to the Granadian\r\nConfederacy, who was appointed on the 29th day of May, 1861, was directed,\r\nin view of the occupation of the capital by the revolutionary party and of\r\nthe uncertainty of the civil war, not to present his credentials to either\r\nthe government of the Granadian Confederacy or to the provisional military\r\ngovernment, but to conduct his affairs informally, as is customary in such\r\ncases, and to report the progress of events and await the instructions of\r\nthis Government. The advices which have been received from him have not\r\nhitherto, been sufficiently conclusive to determine me to recognize the\r\nrevolutionary government. General Herran being here, with full authority\r\nfrom the Government of New Canada, which has been so long recognized\r\nby the United States, I have not received any representative from the\r\nrevolutionary government, which has not yet been recognized, because such\r\na proceeding would be in itself an act of recognition.\r\n\r\nOfficial communications have been had on various incidental and occasional\r\nquestions with General Herran as the minister plenipotentiary and envoy\r\nextraordinary of the Granadian Confederacy, but in no other character. No\r\ndefinitive measure or proceeding has resulted from these communications,\r\nand a communication of them at present would not, in my judgment, be\r\ncompatible with the public interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, January 15, 1863.\r\n\r\nSECRETARY OF WAR:\r\n\r\nPlease see Mr. Stafford, who wants to assist in raising colored troops in\r\nMissouri.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINTING MONEY\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nJanuary 17, 1863.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nI have signed the joint resolution to provide for the immediate payment\r\nof the army and navy of the United States, passed by the House of\r\nRepresentatives on the 14th and by the Senate on the 15th instant.\r\n\r\nThe joint resolution is a simple authority, amounting, however, under\r\nexisting circumstances, to a direction, to the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nto make an additional issue of $100,000,000 in United States notes, if so\r\nmuch money is needed, for the payment of the army and navy.\r\n\r\nMy approval is given in order that every possible facility may be afforded\r\nfor the prompt discharge of all arrears of pay due to our soldiers and our\r\nsailors.\r\n\r\nWhile giving this approval, however, I think it my duty to express my\r\nsincere regret that it has been found necessary to authorize so large an\r\nadditional issue of United States notes, when this circulation and that\r\nof the suspended banks together have become already so redundant as to\r\nincrease prices beyond real values, thereby augmenting the cost of living\r\nto the injury of labor, and the cost of supplies to the injury of the\r\nwhole country.\r\n\r\nIt seems very plain that continued issues of United States notes without\r\nany check to the issues of suspended banks, and without adequate provision\r\nfor the raising of money by loans and for funding the issues so as to keep\r\nthem within due limits, must soon produce disastrous consequences; and\r\nthis matter appears to me so important that I feel bound to avail myself\r\nof this occasion to ask the special attention of Congress to it.\r\n\r\nThat Congress has power to regulate the currency of the country can hardly\r\nadmit of doubt, and that a judicious measure to prevent the deterioration\r\nof this currency, by a seasonable taxation of bank circulation or\r\notherwise, is needed seems equally clear. Independently of this general\r\nconsideration, it would be unjust to the people at large to exempt banks\r\nenjoying the special privilege of circulation from their just proportion\r\nof the public burdens.\r\n\r\nIn order to raise money by way of loans most easily and cheaply, it is\r\nclearly necessary to give every possible support to the public credit. To\r\nthat end a uniform currency, in which taxes, subscriptions to loans, and\r\nall other ordinary public dues as well as all private dues may be paid,\r\nis almost if not quite indispensable. Such a currency can be furnished\r\nby banking associations organized under a general act of Congress, as\r\nsuggested in my message at the beginning of the present session. The\r\nsecuring of this circulation by the pledge of United States bonds, as\r\ntherein suggested, would still further facilitate loans, by increasing the\r\npresent and causing a future demand for such bonds.\r\n\r\nIn view of the actual financial embarrassments of the government, and of\r\nthe greater embarrassment sure to come if the necessary means of relief\r\nbe not afforded, I feel that I should not perform my duty by a simple\r\nannouncement of my approval of the joint resolution, which proposes relief\r\nonly by increased circulation, without expressing my earnest desire that\r\nmeasures such in substance as those I have just referred to may receive\r\nthe early sanction of Congress. By such measures, in my opinion, will\r\npayment be most certainly secured, not only to the army and navy, but to\r\nall honest creditors of the government, and satisfactory provision made\r\nfor future demands on the treasury.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE WORKING-MEN OF MANCHESTER, ENGLAND.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January, 1863.\r\n\r\nTO THE WORKING-MEN OF MANCHESTER:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the address and resolutions\r\nwhich you sent me on the eve of the new year. When I came, on the 4th of\r\nMarch, 1861, through a free and constitutional election to fireside in\r\nthe Government of the United States, the country was found at the verge of\r\ncivil war. Whatever might have been the cause, or whosesoever the fault,\r\none duty, paramount to all others, was before me, namely, to maintain\r\nand preserve at once the Constitution and the integrity of the Federal\r\nRepublic. A conscientious purpose to perform this duty is the key to\r\nall the measures of administration which have been and to all which will\r\nhereafter be pursued. Under our frame of government and my official oath,\r\nI could not depart from this purpose if I would. It is not always in the\r\npower of governments to enlarge or restrict the scope of moral results\r\nwhich follow the policies that they may deem it necessary for the public\r\nsafety from time to time to adopt.\r\n\r\nI have understood well that the duty of self-preservation rests solely\r\nwith the American people; but I have at the same time been aware that\r\nfavor or disfavor of foreign nations might have a material influence\r\nin enlarging or prolonging the struggle with disloyal men in which the\r\ncountry is engaged. A fair examination of history has served to authorize\r\na belief that the past actions and influences of the United States were\r\ngenerally regarded as having been beneficial toward mankind. I have,\r\ntherefore, reckoned upon the forbearance of nations. Circumstances--to\r\nsome of which you kindly allude--induce me especially to expect that if\r\njustice and good faith should be practised by the United States, they\r\nwould encounter no hostile influence on the part of Great Britain. It is\r\nnow a pleasant duty to acknowledge the demonstration you have given of\r\nyour desire that a spirit of amity and peace toward this country may\r\nprevail in the councils of your Queen, who is respected and esteemed in\r\nyour own country only more than she is by the kindred nation which has its\r\nhome on this side of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nI know and deeply deplore the sufferings which the workingmen at\r\nManchester, and in all Europe, are called to endure in this crisis. It has\r\nbeen often and studiously represented that the attempt to overthrow this\r\ngovernment, which was built upon the foundation of human rights, and to\r\nsubstitute for it one which should rest exclusively on the basis of human\r\nslavery, was likely to obtain the favor of Europe. Through the action of\r\nour disloyal citizens, the working-men of Europe have been subjected to\r\nsevere trials, for the purpose of forcing their sanction to that attempt.\r\nUnder the circumstance, I cannot but regard your decisive utterances upon\r\nthe question as an instance of sublime Christian heroism which has not\r\nbeen surpassed in any age or in any country. It is indeed an energetic and\r\ninspiring assurance of the inherent power of truth and of the ultimate and\r\nuniversal triumph of justice, humanity, and freedom. I do not doubt that\r\nthe sentiments, you have expressed will be sustained by your great nation;\r\nand, on the other hand, I have no hesitation in assuring you that they\r\nwill excite admiration, esteem, and the most reciprocal feelings of\r\nfriendship among the American people.\r\n\r\nI hail this interchange of sentiment, therefore, as an augury that\r\nwhatever else may happen, whatever misfortune may befall your country or\r\nmy own, the peace and friendship which now exist between the two nations\r\nwill be, as it shall be my desire to make them, perpetual.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, January 21, 1863.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nI submit herewith for your consideration the joint resolutions of the\r\ncorporate authorities of the city of Washington, adopted September a 7,\r\n1862, and a memorial of the same under date of October 28, 1862, both\r\nrelating to and urging the construction of certain railroads concentrating\r\nupon the city of Washington.\r\n\r\nIn presenting this memorial and the joint resolutions to you, I am not\r\nprepared to say more than that the subject is one of great practical\r\nimportance, and that I hope it will receive the attention of Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFITZ-JOHN PORTER COURT-MARTIAL.\r\n\r\nINDORSEMENT ON THE PROCEEDINGS AND SENTENCE\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, WASHINGTON,\r\n\r\nJanuary 13, 1863.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the Sixty-fifth Article of War, these whole proceedings\r\nare transmitted to the Secretary of War, to be laid before the President\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nH. W. HALLECK,\r\n\r\nGeneral-in-Chief.\r\n\r\nJanuary 21, 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foregoing proceedings, findings, and sentence in the foregoing case\r\nof Major-General Fitz-John Porter are approved and confirmed, and it is\r\nordered that the said Fitz-John Porter be, and he hereby is, cashiered\r\nand dismissed from the service of the United States as a major-general\r\nof volunteers, and as colonel and brevet brigadier-general in the regular\r\nservice of the United States, and forever disqualified from holding any\r\noffice of trust or profit under the Government of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM GENERAL HALLECK TO GENERAL U. S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, WASHINGTON\r\n\r\nJanuary 21, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL GRANT, Memphis.\r\n\r\nGENERAL:--The President has directed that so much of Arkansas as you may\r\ndesire to control be temporarily attached to your department. This will\r\ngive you control of both banks of the river.\r\n\r\nIn your operations down the Mississippi you must not rely too confidently\r\nupon any direct co-operation of General Banks and the lower flotilla, as\r\nit is possible that they may not be able to pass or reduce Port Hudson.\r\nThey, however, will do everything in their power to form a junction with\r\nyou at Vicksburg. If they should not be able to effect this, they will\r\nat least occupy a portion of the enemy's forces, and prevent them from\r\nreinforcing Vicksburg. I hope, however, that they will do still better and\r\nbe able to join you.\r\n\r\nIt may be proper to give you some explanation of the revocation of your\r\norder expelling all Jews from your department. The President has no\r\nobjection to your expelling traitors and Jew peddlers, which, I suppose,\r\nwas the object of your order; but as it in terms proscribed an entire\r\nreligious class, some of whom are fighting in our ranks, the President\r\ndeemed it necessary to revoke it.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nH. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL BURNSIDE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 23, 1863\r\n\r\nGENERAL BURNSIDE:\r\n\r\nWill see you any moment when you come.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER RELIEVING GENERAL A. E. BURNSIDE AND MAKING OTHER CHANGES.\r\n\r\n(General Orders No.20.)\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE, WASHINGTON, D.C. JANUARY 25,\r\n1863.\r\n\r\nI. The President of the United States has directed:\r\n\r\n1st. That Major-General A. E. Burnside, at his own request, be relieved\r\nfrom the command of the Army of the Potomac.\r\n\r\n2d. That Major-General E. V. Sumner, at his own request, be relieved from\r\nduty in the Army of the Potomac.\r\n\r\n3d. That Major-General W. B. Franklin be relieved from duty in the Army of\r\nthe Potomac.\r\n\r\n4th. That Major-General J. Hooker be assigned to the command of the Army\r\nof the Potomac.\r\n\r\nII. The officers relieved as above will report in person to the\r\nadjutant-general of the army.\r\n\r\nBy order of the Secretary of War: D. TOWNSEND, Assistant Adjutant-General\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL J. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., January 26, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HOOKER.\r\n\r\nGENERAL:--I have placed you at the head of the Army of the Potomac. Of\r\ncourse I have done this upon what appear to me to be sufficient reasons,\r\nand yet I think it best for you to know that there are some things in\r\nregard to which I am not quite satisfied with you. I believe you to be a\r\nbrave and skillful soldier, which of course I like. I also believe you do\r\nnot mix politics with your profession, in which you are right. You have\r\nconfidence in yourself, which is a valuable if not an indispensable\r\nquality. You are ambitious, which within reasonable bounds does good\r\nrather than harm; but I think that during General Burnside's command of\r\nthe army you have taken counsel of your ambition and thwarted him as much\r\nas you could, in which you did a great wrong to the country and to a most\r\nmeritorious and honorable brother officer. I have heard, in such a way\r\nas to believe it, of your recently saying that both the army and the\r\ngovernment needed a dictator. Of course it was not for this, but in spite\r\nof it, that I have given you the command. Only those generals who gain\r\nsuccesses can set up dictators. What I now ask of you is military success,\r\nand I will risk the dictatorship. The government will support you to the\r\nutmost of its ability, which is neither more nor less than it has done\r\nand will do for all commanders. I much fear that the spirit that you\r\nhave aided to infuse into the army, of criticizing their commander and\r\nwithholding confidence from him, will now turn upon you. I shall assist\r\nyou as far as I can to put it down. Neither you nor Napoleon, if he\r\nwere alive again, could get any good out of an army while such a spirit\r\nprevails in it. And now beware of rashness. Beware of rashness, but with\r\nenergy and sleepless vigilance go forward and give us victories.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, January 28,1863,\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nIn conformity to the law of July 16, 1862, I most cordially recommend\r\nthat Commander David D. Porter, United States Navy, acting rear-admiral,\r\ncommanding the Mississippi Squadron, receive a vote of thanks of Congress\r\nfor the bravery and skill displayed in the attack on the post of Arkansas,\r\nwhich surrendered to the combined military and naval forces on the 10th\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE WORKING-MEN OF LONDON, ENGLAND.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, February 1, 1863.\r\n\r\nTO THE WORKING-MEN OF LONDON:\r\n\r\nI have received the New Year's address which you have sent me, with a\r\nsincere appreciation of the exalted and humane sentiments by which it was\r\ninspired.\r\n\r\nAs these sentiments are manifestly the enduring support of the free\r\ninstitutions of England, so I am sure also that they constitute the only\r\nreliable basis for free institutions throughout the world.\r\n\r\nThe resources, advantages, and powers of the American people are\r\nvery great, and they have consequently succeeded to equally great\r\nresponsibilities. It seems to have devolved upon them to test whether\r\na government established on the principles of human freedom can be\r\nmaintained against an effort to build one upon the exclusive foundation of\r\nhuman bondage. They will rejoice with me in the new evidences which your\r\nproceedings furnish that the magnanimity they are exhibiting is justly\r\nestimated by the true friends of freedom and humanity in foreign\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nAccept my best wishes for your individual welfare, and for the welfare and\r\nhappiness of the whole British people.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL SCHENCK. [Cipher.] WAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE SENATE.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., February 12, 1863.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of September, 1862, Commander George Henry Preble, United\r\nStates Navy, then senior officer in command of the naval force off the\r\nharbor of Mobile, was guilty of inexcusable neglect in permitting the\r\narmed steamer Oreto in open daylight to run the blockade. For his omission\r\nto perform his whole duty on that occasion, and the injury thereby\r\ninflicted on the service and the country, his name was stricken from the\r\nlist of naval officers and he was dismissed [from] the service.\r\n\r\nSince his dismissal earnest application has been made for his restoration\r\nto his former position by senators and naval officers, on the ground that\r\nhis fault was an error of judgment, and that the example in his case has\r\nalready had its effect in preventing a repetition of similar neglect.\r\n\r\nI therefore on this application and representation, and in consideration\r\nof his previous fair record, do hereby nominate George Henry Preble to\r\nbe a commander in the navy from the 16th July, 1862, to take rank on the\r\nactive list next after Commander Edward Donaldson, and to fill a vacancy\r\noccasioned by the death of Commander J. M. Wainwright.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE TO THE SENATE.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., February 12, 1863.\r\n\r\nTO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nOn the 24th August, 1861, Commander Roger Perry, United. States Navy,\r\nwas dismissed from the service under a misapprehension in regard to his\r\nloyalty to the Government, from the circumstance that several oaths\r\nwere transmitted to him and the Navy Department failed to receive any\r\nrecognition of them. After his dismissal, and upon his assurance that\r\nthe oath failed to reach him and his readiness to execute it, he was\r\nrecommissioned to his original position on the 4th September following.\r\nOn the same day, 4th September, he was ordered to command the sloop of war\r\nVandalia; on the 22d this order was revoked and he was ordered to duty in\r\nthe Mississippi Squadron, and on the 23d January, 1862, was detached sick,\r\nand has since remained unemployed. The advisory board under the act of\r\n16th July, 1862, did not recommend him for further promotion.\r\n\r\nThis last commission, having been issued during the recess of the Senate,\r\nexpired at the end of the succeeding session, 17th July, 1862, from which\r\ndate, not having been nominated to the Senate, he ceased to be a commander\r\nin the navy.\r\n\r\nTo correct the omission to nominate this officer to the Senate at its last\r\nsession, I now nominate Commander Roger Perry to be a commander in the\r\nnavy from the 14th September, 1855, to take his relative position on the\r\nlist of commanders not recommended for further promotion.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

It\r\npains me some that this tilt for the place of Colonel Baker's friend\r\ngrows so fierce, now that the Colonel is no longer alive to defend him.\r\nI presume, however, we shall have no rest from it. In self-defense I am\r\ndisposed to say, \"Make a selection and send it to me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

Done at the city of\r\nWashington, this tenth day of March, A.D. 1863, and of the independence of\r\nthe United States the eighty-seventh.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:  EDWIN M.

I would like to oblige both if it would not\r\ninjure the service in your army, or incommode you. What say you?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY SEWARD.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, Match 15, 1863.\r\n\r\nI am very glad of your note saying \"recent despatches from him are able,\r\njudicious, and loyal,\" and that if I agree; we will leave him there. I am\r\nglad to agree, so long as the public interest does not seem to require his\r\nremoval.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO J. O. MORTON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, March 16, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. J. O. MORTON, Joliet, Ill.: William Chumasero is proposed for\r\nprovost-marshal of your district. What think you of it?

KNOX.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, March 20, 1863.\r\n\r\nWHOM IT MAY CONCERN:--Whereas, it appears to my satisfaction that Thomas\r\nW. Knox, a correspondent of the New York Herald, has been by the sentence\r\nof a court-martial excluded from the military department under command\r\nof Major-General Grant, and also that General Thayer, president of the\r\ncourt-martial which rendered the sentence, and Major-General McClernand,\r\nin command of a corps of that department, and many other respectable\r\npersons, are of opinion that Mr. Knox's offense was technical rather than\r\nwilfully wrong, and that the sentence should be revoked: now, therefore,\r\nsaid sentence is hereby so far revoked as to allow Mr. Knox to return to\r\nGeneral Grant's headquarters, and to remain if General Grant shall give\r\nhis express assent, and to again leave the department if General Grant\r\nshall refuse such assent.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BENJAMIN GRATZ.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, March 25,1863.\r\n\r\nMr. BENJAMIN GRATZ, Lexington, Ky.:\r\n\r\nShow this to whom it may concern as your authority for allowing Mrs. Selby\r\nto remain at your house, so long as you choose to be responsible for what\r\nshe may do.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

General Mitchell (was) nominated and rejected by the\r\nSenate and I do not think it proper for me to renominate him without a\r\nchange of circumstances such as the performance of additional service, or\r\nan expressed change of purpose on the part of at least some senators who\r\nopposed him.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

ANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I am told you have at least thought of raising a negro\r\nmilitary force. In my opinion the country now needs no specific thing so\r\nmuch as some man of your ability and position to go to this work. When I\r\nspeak of your position, I mean that of an eminent citizen of a slave State\r\nand himself a slaveholder. The colored population is the great available\r\nand yet unavailed of force for restoring the Union. The bare sight of\r\nfifty thousand armed and drilled black soldiers upon the banks of the\r\nMississippi would end the rebellion at once; and who doubts that we\r\ncan present that sight if we but take hold in earnest? If you have been\r\nthinking of it, please do not dismiss the thought.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION APPOINTING A NATIONAL FAST-DAY.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nMarch 30, 1863.\r\n\r\nWhereas the Senate of the United States, devoutly recognizing the supreme\r\nauthority and just government of Almighty God in all the affairs of men\r\nand of nations, has by a resolution requested the President to designate\r\nand set apart a day for national prayer and humiliation:\r\n\r\nAnd whereas it is the duty of nations as well as men to own their\r\ndependence upon the overruling power of God; to confess their sins and\r\ntransgressions in humble sorrow, yet with assured hope that genuine\r\nrepentance will lead to mercy and pardon; and to recognize the sublime\r\ntruth, announced in the Holy Scriptures and proven by all history, that\r\nthose nations only are blessed whose God is the Lord:\r\n\r\nAnd insomuch as we know that by His divine law nations, like individuals,\r\nare subjected to punishments and chastisements in this world, may we not\r\njustly fear that the awful calamity of civil war which now desolates the\r\nland may be but a punishment inflicted upon us for our presumptuous sins,\r\nto the needful end of our national reformation as a whole people? We\r\nhave been the recipients of the choicest bounties of Heaven. We have been\r\npreserved, these many years, in peace and prosperity. We have grown in\r\nnumbers, wealth, and power as no other nation has ever grown; but we have\r\nforgotten God. We have forgotten the gracious hand which preserved us in\r\npeace, and multiplied and enriched and strengthened us; and we have vainly\r\nimagined, in the deceitfulness of our hearts, that all these blessings\r\nwere produced by some superior wisdom and virtue of our own. Intoxicated\r\nwith unbroken success, we have become too self-sufficient to feel the\r\nnecessity of redeeming and preserving grace, too proud to pray to the God\r\nthat made us:\r\n\r\nIt behooves us, then, to humble ourselves before the offended Power, to\r\nconfess our national sins, and to pray for clemency and forgiveness:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, in compliance with the request, and fully concurring in\r\nthe views, of the Senate, I do by this my proclamation designate and\r\nset apart Thursday, the 30th day of April, 1863, as a day of national\r\nhumiliation, fasting, and prayer. And I do hereby request all the people\r\nto abstain on that day from their ordinary secular pursuits, and to unite\r\nat their several places of public worship and their respective homes in\r\nkeeping the day holy to the Lord, and devoted to the humble discharge of\r\nthe religious duties proper to that solemn occasion. All this being done\r\nin sincerity and truth, let us then rest humbly in the hope, authorized by\r\nthe divine teachings, that the united cry of the nation will be heard on\r\nhigh, and answered with blessings no less than the pardon of our national\r\nsins, and the restoration of our now divided and suffering country to its\r\nformer happy condition of unity and peace.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this thirtieth day of March, in the\r\nyear of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and of the\r\nindependence of the United States the eighty-seventh.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

C April 1, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HUNTER.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I am glad to see the accounts of your colored force at\r\nJacksonville, Florida. I see the enemy are driving at them fiercely, as is\r\nto be expected. It is important to the enemy that such a force shall not\r\ntake shape and grow and thrive in the South, and in precisely the same\r\nproportion it is important to us that it shall. Hence the utmost caution\r\nand vigilance is necessary on our part. The enemy will make extra efforts\r\nto destroy them, and we should do the same to preserve and increase them.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPINION ON HARBOR DEFENSE.\r\n\r\nApril 4, 1863.\r\n\r\nOn this general subject I respectfully refer Mr.------__ to the\r\nSecretaries of War and Navy for conference and consultation. I have a\r\nsingle idea of my own about harbor defense. It is a steam ram, built so\r\nas to sacrifice nearly all capacity for carrying to those of speed and\r\nstrength, so as to be able to split any vessel having hollow enough in her\r\nto carry supplies for a voyage of any distance. Such ram, of course, could\r\nnot herself carry supplies for a voyage of considerable distance, and her\r\nbusiness would be to guard a particular harbor as a bulldog guards his\r\nmaster's door.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY.\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMY POTOMAC, April 9, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF THE NAVY:\r\n\r\nRichmond Whig of the 8th has no telegraphic despatches from Charleston,\r\nbut has the following as editorial:\r\n\r\n\"All thoughts are now centred upon Charleston. Official intelligence was\r\nmade public early yesterday morning that the enemy's iron-clad fleet\r\nhad attempted to cross the bar and failed, but later in the day it was\r\nannounced that the gunboats and transports had succeeded in crossing and\r\nwere at anchor. Our iron-clads lay between the forts quietly awaiting the\r\nattack. Further intelligence is looked for with eager anxiety. The Yankees\r\nhave made no secret of this vast preparation for an attack on Charleston,\r\nand we may well anticipate a desperate conflict. At last the hour of trial\r\nhas come for Charleston, the hour of deliverance or destruction, for no\r\none believes the other alternative, surrender, possible. The heart of the\r\nwhole country yearns toward the beleaguered city with intense solicitude,\r\nyet with hopes amounting to confidence. Charleston knows what is expected\r\nof her, and which is due to her fame, and to the relation she sustains to\r\nthe cause. The devoted, the heroic, the great-hearted Beauregard is there,\r\nand he, too, knows what is expected of him and will not disappoint that\r\nexpectation. We predict a Saragossa defense, and that if Charleston is\r\ntaken it will be only a heap of ruins.\"\r\n\r\nThe rebel pickets are reported as calling over to our pickets today that\r\nwe had taken some rebel fort. This is not very intelligible, and I think\r\nis entirely unreliable.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

Minnick of Wynkoop's cavalry under sentence of death, by a\r\ncourt-martial or military commission, in Nashville? And if so what was his\r\noffense, and when is he to be executed?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nIf necessary let the execution be staid till I can be heard from again.\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n     [President Lincoln sent many telegrams similar in form to\r\n     this one in order to avoid tiresome repetition the editor\r\n     has omitted all those without especial interest.  Hardly a\r\n     day went by that there were not people in the White House\r\n     begging mercy for a sentenced soldier.  A mother one day,\r\n     pleaded with Lincoln to remit the sentence of execution on\r\n     her son. \"Well, I don't think it will do him a bit of good\"\r\n     said Mr. Lincoln--\"Pardoned.\" D.W.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL HOOKER.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON D.C., April 12, 1863\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HOOKER:\r\n\r\nYour letter by the hand of General Butterfield is received, and will be\r\nconformed to.

Do not allow the\r\nenemy to erect new batteries or defenses on Morris Island. If he has begun\r\nit, drive him out. I do not herein order you to renew the general attack.\r\nThat is to depend on your own discretion or a further order.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL D. HUNTER AND ADMIRAL S. F. DUPONT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, April 54, 1863.\r\n\r\nGENERAL HUNTER AND ADMIRAL DUPONT:\r\n\r\nThis is intended to clear up an apparent inconsistency between the recent\r\norder to continue operations before Charleston and the former one to\r\nremove to another point in a certain contingency. No censure upon you, or\r\neither of you, is intended. We still hope that by cordial and judicious\r\nco-operation you can take the batteries on Morris Island and Sullivan's\r\nIsland and Fort Sumter. But whether you can or not, we wish the\r\ndemonstration kept up for a time, for a collateral and very important\r\nobject. We wish the attempt to be a real one, though not a desperate one,\r\nif it affords any considerable chance of success. But if prosecuted as a\r\ndemonstration only, this must not become public, or the whole effect will\r\nbe lost. Once again before Charleston, do not leave until further orders\r\nfrom here. Of course this is not intended to force you to leave unduly\r\nexposed Hilton Head or other near points in your charge.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nP.

The latter gives me\r\nconsiderable uneasiness. The rain and mud of course were to be calculated\r\nupon. General S. is not moving rapidly enough to make the expedition come\r\nto anything. He has now been out three days, two of which were unusually\r\nfair weather, and all three without hindrance from the enemy, and yet\r\nhe is not twenty-five miles from where he started. To reach his point he\r\nstill has sixty to go, another river (the Rapidan) to cross, and will be\r\nhindered by the enemy. By arithmetic, how many days will it take him to\r\ndo it? I do not know that any better can be done, but I greatly fear it is\r\nanother failure already. Write me often. I am very anxious.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATEHOOD FOR WEST VIRGINIA, APRIL 20, 1863.\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION ADMITTING WEST VIRGINIA INTO THE UNION,\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nWhereas by the act of Congress approved the 31st day of December last\r\nthe State of West Virginia was declared to be one of the United States\r\nof America, and was admitted into the Union on an equal footing with the\r\noriginal States in all respects whatever, upon the condition that certain\r\nchanges should be duly made in the proposed constitution for that State;\r\nand\r\n\r\nWhereas proof of a compliance with that condition, as required by the\r\nsecond section of the act aforesaid, has been submitted to me:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the\r\nUnited States, do hereby, in pursuance of the act of Congress aforesaid,\r\ndeclare and proclaim that the said act shall take effect and be in force\r\nfrom and after sixty days from the date hereof.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the\r\nUnited States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this twentieth day of April, A.D. 1863,\r\nand of the independence of the United States the eighty-seventh.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL W. S. ROSECRANS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, APRIL 23, 1863 10.10am\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL ROSECRANS, Murfreesborough, Tenn.:\r\n\r\nYour despatch of the 21st received. I really cannot say that I have\r\nheard any complaint of you. I have heard complaint of a police corps at\r\nNashville, but your name was not mentioned in connection with it, so far\r\nas I remember. It may be that by inference you are connected with it, but\r\nmy attention has never been drawn to it in that light.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., April 27, 1863. 3.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HOOKER:\r\n\r\nHow does it look now?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR CURTIN.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, April 28, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. A. O. CURTIN, Harrisburg, Penn.:\r\n\r\nI do not think the people of Pennsylvania should be uneasy about an\r\ninvasion. Doubtless a small force of the enemy is flourishing about in\r\nthe northern part of Virginia, on the \"skewhorn\" principle, on purpose to\r\ndivert us in another quarter. I believe it is nothing more. We think we\r\nhave adequate force close after them.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO W. A. NEWELL.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, April 29, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. W. A. NEWELL, Allentown, N.J.:\r\n\r\nI have some trouble about provost-marshal in your first district.\r\nPlease procure HON. Mr. Starr to come with you and see me, or come to an\r\nagreement with him and telegraph me the result.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR CURTIN,\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, MAY 1, 1863\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR CURTIN, Harrisburg, Penn.:\r\n\r\nThe whole disposable force at Baltimore and else where in reach have\r\nalready been sent after the enemy which alarms you. The worst thing the\r\nenemy could do for himself would be to weaken himself before Hooker, and\r\ntherefore it is safe to believe he is not doing it; and the best thing\r\nhe could do for himself would be to get us so scared as to bring part\r\nof Hooker's force away, and that is just what he is trying to do. I will\r\ntelegraph you in the morning about calling out the militia.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR CURTIN\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, MAY 2, 1863\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR CURTIN, Harrisburg, Penn.:\r\n\r\nGeneral Halleck tells me he has a despatch from General Schenck this\r\nmorning, informing him that our forces have joined, and that the enemy\r\nmenacing Pennsylvania will have to fight or run today. I hope I am not\r\nless anxious to do my duty to Pennsylvania than yourself, but I really\r\ndo not yet see the justification for incurring the trouble and expense of\r\ncalling out the militia. I shall keep watch, and try to do my duty.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN P. S.--Our forces are exactly between the enemy and\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL D. BUTTERFIELD.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., May 3, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BUTTERFIELD, Chief of Staff:\r\n\r\nThe President thanks you for your telegrams, and hopes you will keep him\r\nadvised as rapidly as any information reaches you.\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERALS LOST\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL D. BUTTERFIELD.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., May 3, 1863. 4.35 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BUTTERFIELD:\r\n\r\nWhere is General Hooker? Where is Sedgwick Where is Stoneman?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., May 4, 1863. 3.10 P M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HOOKER:\r\n\r\nWe have news here that the enemy has reoccupied heights above\r\nFredericksburg. Is that so?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL BURNSIDE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, May 4, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BURNSIDE, Cincinnati, O.:\r\n\r\nOur friend General Sigel claims that you owe him a letter. If you so\r\nremember please write him at once. He is here.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL HOOKER.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., May 6, 1863. 2.25. P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HOOKER:\r\n\r\nWe have through General Dix the contents of Richmond papers of the 5th.\r\nGeneral Dix's despatch in full is going to you by Captain Fox of the navy.\r\nThe substance is General Lee's despatch of the 3d (Sunday), claiming\r\nthat he had beaten you and that you were then retreating across the\r\nRappahannock, distinctly stating that two of Longstreet's divisions fought\r\nyou on Saturday, and that General [E. F.] Paxton was killed, Stonewall\r\nJackson severely wounded, and Generals Heth and A. P. Hill slightly\r\nwounded. The Richmond papers also stated, upon what authority not\r\nmentioned, that our cavalry have been at Ashland, Hanover Court-House,\r\nand other points, destroying several locomotives and a good deal of other\r\nproperty, and all the railroad bridges to within five miles of Richmond.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL HOOKER\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., May 6, 1863. 12.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nJust as I telegraphed you contents of Richmond papers showing that our\r\ncavalry has not failed, I received General Butterfield's of 11 A.M.\r\nyesterday. This, with the great rain of yesterday and last night securing\r\nyour right flank, I think puts a new face upon your case; but you must be\r\nthe judge.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO COLONEL R. INGALLS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., May 6, 1863 1.45 PM\r\n\r\nCOLONEL INGALLS:\r\n\r\nNews has gone to General Hooker which may change his plans. Act in view of\r\nsuch contingency.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL J. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 7, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HOOKER.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--The recent movement of your army is ended without effecting\r\nits object, except, perhaps, some important breakings of the enemy's\r\ncommunications. What next? If possible, I would be very glad of another\r\nmovement early enough to give us some benefit from the fact of the enemy's\r\ncommunication being broken; but neither for this reason nor any other do\r\nI wish anything done in desperation or rashness. An early movement would\r\nalso help to supersede the bad moral effect of there certain, which is\r\nsaid to be considerably injurious. Have you already in your mind a plan\r\nwholly or partially formed? If you have, prosecute it without interference\r\nfrom me. If you have not, please inform me, so that I, incompetent as I\r\nmay be, can try and assist in the formation of some plan for the army.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAFTING OF ALIENS\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION CONCERNING ALIENS,\r\n\r\nMAY 8, 1863.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation\r\n\r\nWhereas the Congress of the United States, at its last session, enacted a\r\nlaw entitled \"An act for enrolling and calling out the national forces and\r\nfor other purposes,\" which was approved on the 3d day of March last; and\r\n\r\nWhereas it is recited in the said act that there now exists in the United\r\nStates an insurrection and rebellion against the authority thereof, and\r\nit is, under the Constitution of the United States, the duty of the\r\ngovernment to suppress insurrection and rebellion, to guarantee to\r\neach State a republican form of government, and to preserve the public\r\ntranquillity; and\r\n\r\nWhereas for these high purposes a military force is indispensable, to\r\nraise and support which all persons Ought willingly to contribute; and\r\n\r\nWhereas no service can be more praiseworthy and honorable than that which\r\nis rendered for the maintenance of the Constitution and the Union, and the\r\nconsequent preservation of free government; and\r\n\r\nWhereas, for the reasons thus recited, it was enacted by the said statute\r\nthat all able-bodied male citizens of the United States, and persons of\r\nforeign birth who shall have declared on oath their intention to become\r\ncitizens under and in pursuance of the laws thereof, between the ages of\r\ntwenty and forty-five years (with certain exceptions not necessary to be\r\nhere mentioned), are declared to constitute the national forces, and shall\r\nbe liable to perform military duty in the service of the United States\r\nwhen called out by the President for that purpose; and\r\n\r\nWhereas it is claimed by and in behalf of persons of foreign birth within\r\nthe ages specified in said act, who have heretofore declared on oath their\r\nintentions to become citizens under and in pursuance of the laws of the\r\nUnited States, and who have not exercised the right of suffrage or any\r\nother political franchise under the laws of the United States, or of any\r\nof the States thereof, that they are not absolutely concluded by their\r\naforesaid declaration of intention from renouncing their purpose to become\r\ncitizens, and that, on the contrary, such persons under treaties or the\r\nlaw of nations retain a right to renounce that purpose and to forego the\r\nprivileges of citizenship and residence within the United States under the\r\nobligations imposed by the aforesaid act of Congress:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, to avoid all misapprehensions concerning the liability of\r\npersons concerned to perform the service required by such enactment, and\r\nto give it full effect, I do hereby order and proclaim that no plea\r\nof alienage will be received or allowed to exempt from the obligations\r\nimposed by the aforesaid act of Congress any person of foreign birth\r\nwho shall have declared on oath his intention to become a citizen of the\r\nUnited States under the laws thereof, and who shall be found within\r\nthe United States at any time during the continuance of the present\r\ninsurrection and rebellion, at or after the expiration of the period of\r\nsixty-five days from the date of this proclamation; nor shall any such\r\nplea of alienage be allowed in favor of any such person who has so,\r\nas aforesaid, declared his intention to become a citizen of the United\r\nStates, and shall have exercised at any time the right of suffrage, or\r\nany other political franchise, within the United States, under the laws\r\nthereof, or under the laws of any of the several States.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed. Done at the city of Washington, this\r\neighth day of May, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred\r\nand sixty-three, and of the independence of the United States the\r\neighty-seventh.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:  WILLIAM H. SEWARD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C. May 8, 1863. 4 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HOOKER:\r\n\r\nThe news is here of the capture by our forces of Grand Gulf--a large and\r\nvery important thing. General Willich, an exchanged prisoner just from\r\nRichmond, has talked with me this morning. He was there when our cavalry\r\ncut the roads in that vicinity. He says there was not a sound pair of legs\r\nin Richmond, and that our men, had they known it, could have safely\r\ngone in and burned everything and brought in Jeff Davis. We captured and\r\nparoled 300 or 400 men. He says as he came to City Point there was an army\r\nthree miles long (Longstreet's, he thought) moving toward Richmond.\r\n\r\nMuroy has captured a despatch of General Lee, in which he says his loss\r\nwas fearful in his last battle with you.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. A. DIX.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, May 9,1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL DIX:\r\n\r\nIt is very important for Hooker to know exactly what damage is done to\r\nthe railroads at all points between Fredericksburg and Richmond. As yet we\r\nhave no word as to whether the crossings of the North and South Anna, or\r\nany of them, have been touched. There are four of these Crossings;\r\nthat is, one on each road on each stream. You readily perceive why this\r\ninformation is desired. I suppose Kilpatrick or Davis can tell. Please\r\nascertain fully what was done, and what is the present condition, as near\r\nas you can, and advise me at once.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY SEWARD.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 9, 1863\r\n\r\nI believe Mr. L. is a good man, but two things need to be remembered.\r\n\r\n1st. Mr. R.'s rival was a relative of Mr. L.\r\n\r\n2d. I hear of nobody calling Mr. R. a \"Copperhead,\" but Mr. L. However,\r\nlet us watch.\r\n\r\nA. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, MAY 11, 1863\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--I have again concluded to relieve General Curtis. I see no\r\nother way to avoid the worst consequences there. I think of General\r\nSchofield as his successor, but I do not wish to take the matter of a\r\nsuccessor out of the hands of yourself and General Halleck.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL DIX.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, May 11, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL DIX:\r\n\r\nDo the Richmond papers have anything about Grand Gulf or Vicksburg?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL BUTTERFIELD.\r\n\r\n[Cipher.]\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, May 11, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BUTTERFIELD:\r\n\r\nAbout what distance is it from the observatory we stopped at last Thursday\r\nto the line of enemies' works you ranged the glass upon for me?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR SEYMOUR\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, May 12, 1863.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR SEYMOUR, Albany, N.Y.:\r\n\r\nDr. Swinburne and Mr. Gillett are here, having been refused, as they say,\r\nby the War Department, permission to go to the Army of the Potomac. They\r\nnow appeal to me, saying you wish them to go. I suppose they have been\r\nexcluded by a rule which experience has induced the department to deem\r\nproper; still they shall have leave to go, if you say you desire it.\r\nPlease answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO A. G. HENRY.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON May 13,1863.\r\n\r\nDr. A. G. HENRY, Metropolitan Hotel, New York:\r\n\r\nGovernor Chase's feelings were hurt by my action in his absence. Smith is\r\nremoved, but Governor Chase wishes to name his successor, and asks a day\r\nor two to make the designation.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL J. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D.C. May 14, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HOOKER, Commanding.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--When I wrote on the 7th, I had an impression that possibly\r\nby an early movement you could get some advantage from the supposed facts\r\nthat the enemy's communications were disturbed and that he was somewhat\r\nderanged in position. That idea has now passed away, the enemy having\r\nre-established his communications, regained his positions, and actually\r\nreceived reinforcements. It does not now appear probable to me that\r\nyou can gain anything by an early renewal of the attempt to cross the\r\nRappahannock. I therefore shall not complain if you do no more for a time\r\nthan to keep the enemy at bay and out of other mischief by menaces and\r\noccasional cavalry raids, if practicable, and to put your own army in good\r\ncondition again. Still, if in your own clear judgment you can renew the\r\nattack successfully, I do not mean to restrain you. Bearing upon this last\r\npoint, I must tell you that I have some painful intimations that some\r\nof your corps and division commanders are not giving you their entire\r\nconfidence. This would be ruinous, if true, and you should therefore,\r\nfirst of all, ascertain the real facts beyond all possibility of doubt.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTIONAL QUARRELS\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO H. T. BLOW AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, May 15, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. H. T. BLOW, C. D. DRAKE, AND OTHERS, St. Louis, Mo.:\r\n\r\nYour despatch of to-day is just received. It is very painful to me that\r\nyou in Missouri cannot or will not settle your factional quarrel among\r\nyourselves. I have been tormented with it beyond endurance for months\r\nby both sides. Neither side pays the least respect to my appeals to your\r\nreason. I am now compelled to take hold of the case.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO JAMES GUTHRIE.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, May 16, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. JAMES GUTHRIE, Louisville, Ky.:\r\n\r\nYour despatch of to-day is received. I personally know nothing of Colonel\r\nChurchill, but months ago and more than once he has been represented to me\r\nas exerting a mischievous influence at Saint Louis, for which reason I\r\nam unwilling to force his continuance there against the judgment of our\r\nfriends on the ground; but if it will oblige you, he may come to and\r\nremain at Louisville upon taking the oath of allegiance, and your pledge\r\nfor his good behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, May 16, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--The commander of the Department at St. Louis has ordered\r\nseveral persons south of our military lines, which order is not\r\ndisapproved by me. Yet at the special request of the HON. James Guthrie\r\nI have consented to one of the number, Samuel Churchill, remaining at\r\nLouisville, Ky., upon condition of his taking the oath of allegiance and\r\nMr. Gutlirie's word of honor for his good behavior.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDERS SENDING C. L. VALLANDIGHAM BEYOND MILITARY LINES.\r\n\r\n[Cipher.]\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES MILITARY TELEGRAPH, May 10, 1863. By telegraph from\r\nWashington, 9.40 PM, 1863\r\n\r\nTO MAJOR-GENERAL BURNSIDE, Commanding Department of Ohio.\r\n\r\nSIR:--The President directs that without delay you send C. L. Vallandigham\r\nunder secure guard to the Headquarters of General Rosecrans, to be put by\r\nhim beyond our military lines; and in case of his return within our lines,\r\nhe be arrested and kept in close custody for the term specified in his\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\nBy order of the President:  E. R. S. CANBY, Assistant Adjutant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, May 20, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL A. B. BURNSIDE, Commanding Department of Ohio, Cincinnati,\r\nO.\r\n\r\nYour despatch of three o'clock this afternoon to the Secretary of War has\r\nbeen received and shown to the President. He thinks the best disposition\r\nto be made of Vallandigham is to put him beyond the lines, as directed in\r\nthe order transmitted to you last evening, and directs that you execute\r\nthat order by sending him forward under secure guard without delay to\r\nGeneral Rosecrans.\r\n\r\nBy order of the President:  ED. R. S. CANBY, Brigadier-General\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL W. S. ROSECRANS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 20, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL ROSECRANS:\r\n\r\nYours of yesterday in regard to Colonel Haggard is received. I am anxious\r\nthat you shall not misunderstand me. In no case have I intended to censure\r\nyou or to question your ability. In Colonel Haggard's case I meant no more\r\nthan to suggest that possibly you might have been mistaken in a point that\r\ncould [be] corrected. I frequently make mistakes myself in the many things\r\nI am compelled to do hastily.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL W. S. ROSECRANS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 21, 1863. 4.40 PM.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL ROSECRANS:\r\n\r\nFor certain reasons it is thought best for Rev. Dr. Jaquess not to come\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nPresent my respects to him, and ask him to write me fully on the subject\r\nhe has in contemplation.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL S. A. HURLBUT.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 22, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HURLBUT, Memphis, Tenn.:\r\n\r\nWe have news here in the Richmond newspapers of 20th and 21st, including\r\na despatch from General Joe Johnston himself, that on the 15th or 16th--a\r\nlittle confusion as to the day--Grant beat Pemberton and [W. W.] Loring\r\nnear Edwards Station, at the end of a nine hours' fight, driving Pemberton\r\nover the Big Black and cutting Loring off and driving him south to Crystal\r\nSprings, twenty-five miles below Jackson. Joe Johnston telegraphed\r\nall this, except about Loring, from his camp between Brownsville and\r\nLexington, on the 18th. Another despatch indicates that Grant was moving\r\nagainst Johnston on the 18th.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO ANSON STAGER.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., May 24, 1863.10.40\r\n\r\nANSON STAGER, Cleveland, O.:\r\n\r\nLate last night Fuller telegraphed you, as you say, that \"the Stars and\r\nStripes float over Vicksburg and the victory is complete.\" Did he know\r\nwhat he said, or did he say it without knowing it? Your despatch of this\r\nafternoon throws doubt upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO COLONEL HAGGARD.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON. May 25, 1863.\r\n\r\nCOLONEL HAGGARD, Nashville, Tenn.:\r\n\r\nYour despatch to Green Adams has just been shown me. General Rosecrans\r\nknows better than we can know here who should be in charge of the Fifth\r\nCavalry.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL BURNSIDE.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.

ROSECRANS.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, May 27,1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL ROSECRANS, Murfreesborough, Tenn.:\r\n\r\nHave you anything from Grant? Where is Forrest's headquarters?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL SCHOFIELD.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON May 27, 1863.\r\n\r\nGENERAL JOHN M. SCHOFIELD.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Having relieved General Curtis and assigned you to the\r\ncommand of the Department of the Missouri, I think it may be of some\r\nadvantage for me to state why I did it. I did not relieve General Curtis\r\nbecause of any full conviction that he had done wrong by commission or\r\nomission. I did it because of a conviction in my mind that the Union\r\nmen of Missouri, constituting, when united, a vast majority of the\r\nwhole people, have entered into a pestilent factional quarrel among\r\nthemselves--General Curtis, perhaps not of choice, being the head of one\r\nfaction and Governor Gamble that of the other. After months of labor to\r\nreconcile the difficulty, it seemed to grow worse and worse, until I felt\r\nit my duty to break it up somehow; and as I could not remove Governor\r\nGamble, I had to remove General Curtis. Now that you are in the position,\r\nI wish you to undo nothing merely because General Curtis or Governor\r\nGamble did it, but to exercise your own judgment, and do right for the\r\npublic interest. Let your military measures be strong enough to repel the\r\ninvader and keep the peace, and not so strong as to unnecessarily harass\r\nand persecute the people. It is a difficult role, and so much greater will\r\nbe the honor if you perform it well. If both factions, or neither, shall\r\nabuse you, you will probably be about right. Beware of being assailed by\r\none and praised by the other.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL HOOKER.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 27, 1863.11 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HOOKER:\r\n\r\nHave you Richmond papers of this morning?

When I shall wish to supersede you I\r\nwill let you know.

The Thursday mentioned was the 28th, and we have\r\ndespatches here directly from Vicksburg of the 28th, 29th, 30th, and 31st;\r\nand, while they speak of the siege progressing, they speak of no assault\r\nor general fighting whatever, and in fact they so speak as to almost\r\nexclude the idea that there can have been any since Monday the 25th, which\r\nwas not very heavy. Neither do they mention any demand made by Grant\r\nupon Pemberton for a surrender. They speak of our troops as being in good\r\nhealth, condition, and spirits. Some of them do say that Banks has Port\r\nHudson invested.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, June 4, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I have received additional despatches, which, with\r\nformer ones, induce me to believe we should revoke or suspend the order\r\nsuspending the Chicago Times; and if you concur in opinion, please have it\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL HOOKER.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C. JUNE 5, 1863\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HOOKER:\r\n\r\nYours of to-day was received an hour ago. So much of professional military\r\nskill is requisite to answer it that I have turned the task over to\r\nGeneral Halleck. He promises to perform it with his utmost care. I have\r\nbut one idea which I think worth suggesting to you, and that is, in case\r\nyou find Lee coming to the north of the Rappahannock, I would by no\r\nmeans cross to the south of it. If he should leave a rear force\r\nat Fredericksburg, tempting you to fall upon it, it would fight in\r\nentrenchments and have you at advantage, and so, man for man, worst you at\r\nthat point, While his main force would in some way be getting an advantage\r\nof you northward. In one word, I would not take any risk of being\r\nentangled up on the river like an ox jumped half over a fence and liable\r\nto be torn by dogs front and rear without a fair chance to gore one way or\r\nto kick the other.\r\n\r\nIf Lee would come to my side of the river I would keep on the same side\r\nand fight him, or act on the defensive, according as might be my estimate\r\nof his strength relatively to my own. But these are mere suggestions,\r\nwhich I desire to be controlled by the judgment of yourself and General\r\nHalleck.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO MRS.

Now we here have a despatch\r\nfrom there Sunday and others of almost every day preceding since the\r\ninvestment, and while they show the siege progressing they do not show any\r\ngeneral fighting since the 21st and 22d. We have nothing from Port Hudson\r\nlater than the 29th when things looked reasonably well for us. I have\r\nthought this might be of some interest to you.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

We still have nothing of that Richmond newspaper story of\r\nKirby Smith crossing and of Banks losing an arm.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO J. P.

Bunker was\r\nappointed attorney for Nevada Territory. I am pressed to remove him on the\r\nground that he does not attend to the office, nor in fact pass much time\r\nin the Territory. Do you wish to say anything on the subject?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO MRS. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, June 9, 1863.\r\n\r\nMRS.

If you had\r\nRichmond invested to-day you would not be able to take it in twenty days;\r\nmeanwhile your communications, and with them your army, would be ruined.\r\nI think Lee's army, and not Richmond, is your true objective point. If he\r\ncomes towards the upper Potomac, follow on his flank, and on the inside\r\ntrack, shortening your lines while he lengthens his. Fight him, too, when\r\nopportunity offers.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ERASTUS CORNING AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, June 12, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. ERASTUS CORNING AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:--Your letter of May 19, inclosing the resolutions of a public\r\nmeeting held at Albany, New York, on the 16th of the same month, was\r\nreceived several days ago.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions, as I understand them, are resolvable into two\r\npropositions--first, the expression of a purpose to sustain the cause\r\nof the Union, to secure peace through victory, and to support the\r\nadministration in every constitutional and lawful measure to suppress the\r\nrebellion; and, secondly, a declaration of censure upon the administration\r\nfor supposed unconstitutional action, such as the making of military\r\narrests. And from the two propositions a third is deduced, which is that\r\nthe gentlemen composing the meeting are resolved on doing their part\r\nto maintain our common government and country, despite the folly or\r\nwickedness, as they may conceive, of any administration. This position is\r\neminently patriotic, and as such I thank the meeting, and congratulate the\r\nnation for it. My own purpose is the same; so that the meeting and myself\r\nhave a common object, and can have no difference, except in the choice of\r\nmeans or measures for effecting that object.\r\n\r\nAnd here I ought to close this paper, and would close it, if there were no\r\napprehension that more injurious consequences than any merely personal\r\nto myself might follow the censures systematically cast upon me for doing\r\nwhat, in my view of duty, I could not forbear. The resolutions promise\r\nto support me in every constitutional and lawful measure to suppress the\r\nrebellion; and I have not knowingly employed, nor shall knowingly employ,\r\nany other. But the meeting, by their resolutions, assert and argue that\r\ncertain military arrests, and proceedings following them, for which I am\r\nultimately responsible, are unconstitutional. I think they are not. The\r\nresolutions quote from the Constitution the definition of treason, and\r\nalso the limiting safeguards and guarantees therein provided for the\r\ncitizen on trial for treason, and on his being held to answer for capital\r\nor otherwise infamous crimes, and in criminal prosecutions his right to\r\na speedy and public trial by an impartial jury. They proceed to\r\nresolve \"that these safeguards of the rights of the citizen against the\r\npretensions of arbitrary power were intended more especially for his\r\nprotection in times of civil commotion.\" And, apparently to demonstrate\r\nthe proposition, the resolutions proceed: \"They were secured substantially\r\nto the English people after years of protracted civil war, and were\r\nadopted into our Constitution at the close of the Revolution.\" Would not\r\nthe demonstration have been better if it could have been truly said that\r\nthese safeguards had been adopted and applied during the civil wars and\r\nduring our Revolution, instead of after the one and at the close of the\r\nother? I too am devotedly for them after civil war, and before Civil war,\r\nand at all times, \"except when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the\r\npublic safety may require\" their suspension. The resolutions proceed to\r\ntell us that these safeguards \"have stood the test of seventy-six years\r\nof trial under our republican system, under circumstances which show that,\r\nwhile they constitute the foundation of all free government, they are the\r\nelements of the enduring stability of the republic.\" No one denies that\r\nthey have so stood the test up to the beginning of the present rebellion,\r\nif we except a certain occurrence at New Orleans hereafter to be\r\nmentioned; nor does any one question that they will stand the same test\r\nmuch longer after the rebellion closes. But these provisions of the\r\nConstitution have no application to the case we have in hand, because\r\nthe arrests complained of were not made for treason--that is, not for the\r\ntreason defined in the Constitution, and upon the conviction of which the\r\npunishment is death--nor yet were they made to hold persons to answer\r\nfor any capital or otherwise infamous crimes; nor were the proceedings\r\nfollowing, in any constitutional or legal sense, \"criminal prosecutions.\"\r\nThe arrests were made on totally different grounds, and the proceedings\r\nfollowing accorded with the grounds of the arrests. Let us consider the\r\nreal case with which we are dealing, and apply to it the parts of the\r\nConstitution plainly made for such cases.\r\n\r\nPrior to my installation here it had been inculcated that any State had\r\na lawful right to secede from the national Union, and that it would be\r\nexpedient to exercise the right whenever the devotees of the doctrine\r\nshould fail to elect a president to their own liking. I was elected\r\ncontrary to their liking; and accordingly, so far as it was legally\r\npossible, they had taken seven States out of the Union, had seized many\r\nof the United States forts, and had fired upon the United States flag, all\r\nbefore I was inaugurated, and, of course, before I had done any official\r\nact whatever. The rebellion thus begun soon ran into the present civil\r\nwar; and, in certain respects, it began on very unequal terms between the\r\nparties. The insurgents had been preparing for it more than thirty years,\r\nwhile the government had taken no steps to resist them. The former had\r\ncarefully considered all the means which could be turned to their account.\r\nIt undoubtedly was a well-pondered reliance with them that in their own\r\nunrestricted effort to destroy Union, Constitution and law, all together,\r\nthe government would, in great degree, be restrained by the same\r\nConstitution and law from arresting their progress. Their sympathizers\r\ninvaded all departments of the government and nearly all communities\r\nof the people. From this material, under cover of \"liberty of speech,\"\r\n\"liberty of the press,\" and \"habeas corpus,\" they hoped to keep on foot\r\namongst us a most efficient corps of spies, informers, suppliers, and\r\naiders and abettors of their cause in a thousand ways. They knew that\r\nin times such as they were inaugurating, by the Constitution itself the\r\n\"habeas corpus\" might be suspended; but they also knew they had friends\r\nwho would make a question as to who was to suspend it; meanwhile their\r\nspies and others might remain at large to help on their cause. Or if, as\r\nhas happened, the Executive should suspend the writ without ruinous waste\r\nof time, instances of arresting innocent persons might occur, as are\r\nalways likely to occur in such cases; and then a clamor could be raised in\r\nregard to this, which might be at least of some service to the insurgent\r\ncause. It needed no very keen perception to discover this part of the\r\nenemies program, so soon as by open hostilities their machinery was fairly\r\nput in motion. Yet, thoroughly imbued with a reverence for the guaranteed\r\nrights of individuals, I was slow to adopt the strong measures which by\r\ndegrees I have been forced to regard as being within the exceptions of the\r\nConstitution, and as indispensable to the public safety. Nothing is better\r\nknown to history than that courts of justice are utterly incompetent to\r\nsuch cases. Civil courts are organized chiefly for trials of\r\nindividuals--or, at most, a few individuals acting in concert, and this in\r\nquiet times, and on charges of crimes well defined in the law. Even in\r\ntimes of peace bands of horse-thieves and robbers frequently grow too\r\nnumerous and powerful for the ordinary courts of justice. But what\r\ncomparison, in numbers have such bands ever borne to the insurgent\r\nsympathizers even in many of the loyal States? Again, a jury too\r\nfrequently has at least one member more ready to hang the panel than to\r\nhang the traitor. And yet again, he who dissuades one man from\r\nvolunteering, or induces one soldier to desert, weakens the Union cause as\r\nmuch as he who kills a Union soldier in battle. Yet this dissuasion or\r\ninducement may be so conducted as to be no defined crime of which any\r\ncivil court would take cognizance.\r\n\r\n\r\nOurs is a case of rebellion--so called by the resolutions before me--in\r\nfact, a clear, flagrant, and gigantic case of rebellion; and the provision\r\nof the Constitution that \"the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus\r\nshall not be suspended unless when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the\r\npublic safety may require it,\" is the provision which specially applies\r\nto our present case. This provision plainly attests the understanding\r\nof those who made the Constitution that ordinary courts of justice are\r\ninadequate to \"cases of rebellion\"--attests their purpose that, in such\r\ncases, men may be held in custody whom the courts, acting on ordinary\r\nrules, would discharge. Habeas corpus does not discharge men who are\r\nproved to be guilty of defined crime, and its suspension is allowed by the\r\nConstitution on purpose that men may be arrested and held who can not\r\nbe proved to be guilty of defined crime, \"when, in cases of rebellion or\r\ninvasion, the public safety may require it.\"\r\n\r\nThis is precisely our present case--a case of rebellion wherein the public\r\nsafety does require the suspension--Indeed, arrests by process of courts\r\nand arrests in cases of rebellion do not proceed altogether upon the same\r\nbasis. The former is directed at the small percentage of ordinary and\r\ncontinuous perpetration of crime, while the latter is directed at sudden\r\nand extensive uprisings against the government, which, at most, will\r\nsucceed or fail in no great length of time. In the latter case arrests\r\nare made not so much for what has been done as for what probably would be\r\ndone. The latter is more for the preventive and less for the vindictive\r\nthan the former. In such cases the purposes of men are much more easily\r\nunderstood than in cases of ordinary crime. The man who stands by and\r\nsays nothing when the peril of his government is discussed, cannot be\r\nmisunderstood. If not hindered, he is sure to help the enemy; much more\r\nif he talks ambiguously--talks for his country with \"buts,\" and \"ifs,\"\r\nand \"ands.\" Of how little value the constitutional provision I have quoted\r\nwill be rendered if arrests shall never be made until defined crimes shall\r\nhave been committed, may be illustrated by a few notable examples: General\r\nJohn C. Breckinridge, General Robert E. Lee, General Joseph E. Johnston,\r\nGeneral John B. Magruder, General William B. Preston, General Simon B.\r\nBuckner, and Commodore Franklin Buchanan, now occupying the very highest\r\nplaces in the rebel war service, were all within the power of the\r\ngovernment since the rebellion began, and were nearly as well known to\r\nbe traitors then as now. Unquestionably if we had seized and had them\r\nthe insurgent cause would be much weaker. But no one of them had then\r\ncommitted any crime defined in the law. Every one of them, if arrested,\r\nwould have been discharged on habeas corpus were the writ allowed to\r\noperate. In view of these and similar cases, I think the time not unlikely\r\nto come when I shall be blamed for having made too few arrests rather than\r\ntoo many.\r\n\r\nBy the third resolution the meeting indicate their opinion that military\r\narrests may be constitutional in localities where rebellion actually\r\nexists, but that such arrests are unconstitutional in localities where\r\nrebellion or insurrection does not actually exist. They insist that such\r\narrests shall not be made \"outside of the lines of necessary military\r\noccupation and the scenes of insurrection.\" Inasmuch, however, as the\r\nConstitution itself makes no such distinction, I am unable to believe that\r\nthere is any such constitutional distinction. I concede that the class\r\nof arrests complained of can be constitutional only when, in cases of\r\nrebellion or invasion, the public safety may require them; and I insist\r\nthat in such cases--they are constitutional wherever the public safety\r\ndoes require them, as well in places to which they may prevent the\r\nrebellion extending, as in those where it may be already prevailing; as\r\nwell where they may restrain mischievous interference with the raising and\r\nsupplying of armies to suppress the rebellion as where the rebellion may\r\nactually be; as well where they may restrain the enticing men out of\r\nthe army as where they would prevent mutiny in the army; equally\r\nconstitutional at all places where they will conduce to the public safety\r\nas against the dangers of rebellion or invasion. Take the particular\r\ncase mentioned by the meeting. It is asserted in substance that Mr.\r\nVallandigham was, by a military commander, seized and tried \"for no other\r\nreason than words addressed to a public meeting in criticism of the course\r\nof the administration, and in condemnation of the military orders of the\r\ngeneral.\" Now, if there be no mistake about this, if this assertion is the\r\ntruth, and the whole truth, if there were no other reason for the arrest,\r\nthen I concede that the arrest was wrong. But the arrest, as I understand,\r\nwas made for a very different reason. Mr. Vallandigham avows his hostility\r\nto the war on the part of the Union; and his arrest was made because\r\nhe was laboring, with some effect, to prevent the raising of troops, to\r\nencourage desertions from the army, and to leave the rebellion without an\r\nadequate military force to suppress it. He was not arrested because he\r\nwas damaging the political prospects of the administration or the personal\r\ninterests of the commanding general, but because he was damaging the army,\r\nupon the existence and vigor of which the life of the nation depends. He\r\nwas warring upon the military, and thus gave the military constitutional\r\njurisdiction to lay hands upon him. If Mr. Vallandigham was not damaging\r\nthe military power of the country, then his arrest was made on mistake\r\nof fact, which I would be glad to correct on reasonably satisfactory\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nI understand the meeting whose resolutions I am considering to be in favor\r\nof suppressing the rebellion by military force--by armies. Long experience\r\nhas shown that armies cannot be maintained unless desertion shall be\r\npunished by the severe penalty of death. The case requires, and the law\r\nand the Constitution sanction, this punishment. Must I shoot a\r\nsimple-minded boy and not touch a hair of a wily agitator who induced him\r\nto desert. This is none the less injurious when effected by getting a\r\nfather, or brother, or friend into a public meeting, and there working\r\nupon his feelings till he is persuaded to write the soldier boy that he is\r\nfighting in a bad cause, for a wicked administration of a contemptible\r\ngovernment, too weak to arrest and punish him if he shall desert. I think\r\nthat, in such a case, to silence the agitator and save the boy is not only\r\nconstitutional, but withal a great mercy.\r\n\r\nIf I be wrong on this question of constitutional power, my error lies in\r\nbelieving that certain proceedings are constitutional when, in cases of\r\nrebellion or invasion, the public safety requires them, which would not\r\nbe constitutional when, in absence of rebellion or invasion, the public\r\nsafety does not require them: in other words, that the Constitution is\r\nnot in its application in all respects the same in cases of rebellion or\r\ninvasion involving the public safety as it is in times of profound peace\r\nand public security. The Constitution itself makes the distinction, and I\r\ncan no more be persuaded that the government can constitutionally take\r\nno strong measures in time of rebellion, because it can be shown that\r\nthe same could not be lawfully taken in times of peace, than I can be\r\npersuaded that a particular drug is not good medicine for a sick man\r\nbecause it can be shown to not be good food for a well one. Nor am I able\r\nto appreciate the danger apprehended by the meeting, that the American\r\npeople will by means of military arrests during the rebellion lose the\r\nright of public discussion, the liberty of speech and the press, the law\r\nof evidence, trial by jury, and habeas corpus throughout the indefinite\r\npeaceful future which I trust lies before them, any more than I am able to\r\nbelieve that a man could contract so strong an appetite for emetics during\r\ntemporary illness as to persist in feeding upon them during the remainder\r\nof his healthful life.\r\n\r\nIn giving the resolutions that earnest consideration which you request of\r\nme, I cannot overlook the fact that the meeting speak as \"Democrats.\"\r\nNor can I, with full respect for their known intelligence, and the fairly\r\npresumed deliberation with which they prepared their resolutions, be\r\npermitted to suppose that this occurred by accident, or in any way other\r\nthan that they preferred to designate themselves \"Democrats\" rather than\r\n\"American citizens.\" In this time of national peril I would have preferred\r\nto meet you upon a level one step higher than any party platform, because\r\nI am sure that from such more elevated position we could do better battle\r\nfor the country we all love than we possibly can from those lower ones\r\nwhere, from the force of habit, the prejudices of the past, and selfish\r\nhopes of the future, we are sure to expend much of our ingenuity and\r\nstrength in finding fault with and aiming blows at each other. But since\r\nyou have denied me this I will yet be thankful for the country's sake that\r\nnot all Democrats have done so. He on whose discretionary judgment Mr.\r\nVallandigham was arrested and tried is a Democrat, having no old party\r\naffinity with me, and the judge who rejected the constitutional view\r\nexpressed in these resolutions, by refusing to discharge Mr. Vallandigham\r\non habeas corpus is a Democrat of better days than these, having received\r\nhis judicial mantle at the hands of President Jackson. And still more: of\r\nall those Democrats who are nobly exposing their lives and shedding their\r\nblood on the battle-field, I have learned that many approve the course\r\ntaken with Mr. Vallandigham, while I have not heard of a single one\r\ncondemning it. I cannot assert that there are none such. And the name\r\nof President Jackson recalls an instance of pertinent history. After the\r\nbattle of New Orleans, and while the fact that the treaty of peace had\r\nbeen concluded was well known in the city, but before official knowledge\r\nof it had arrived, General Jackson still maintained martial or military\r\nlaw. Now that it could be said that the war was over, the clamor against\r\nmartial law, which had existed from the first, grew more furious. Among\r\nother things, a Mr. Louaillier published a denunciatory newspaper article.\r\nGeneral Jackson arrested him. A lawyer by the name of Morel procured the\r\nUnited States Judge Hall to order a writ of habeas corpus to release Mr.\r\nLouaillier. General Jackson arrested both the lawyer and the judge. A Mr.\r\nHollander ventured to say of some part of the matter that \"it was a dirty\r\ntrick.\" General Jackson arrested him. When the officer undertook to serve\r\nthe writ of habeas corpus, General Jackson took it from him, and sent him\r\naway with a copy. Holding the judge in custody a few days, the general\r\nsent him beyond the limits of his encampment, and set him at liberty with\r\nan order to remain till the ratification of peace should be regularly\r\nannounced, or until the British should have left the southern coast. A day\r\nor two more elapsed, the ratification of the treaty of peace was regularly\r\nannounced, and the judge and others were fully liberated. A few days more,\r\nand the judge called General Jackson into court and fined him $1000 for\r\nhaving arrested him and the others named. The General paid the fine, and\r\nthen the matter rested for nearly thirty years, when Congress refunded\r\nprincipal and interest. The late Senator Douglas, then in the House\r\nof Representatives, took a leading part in the debates, in which the\r\nconstitutional question was much discussed. I am not prepared to say whom\r\nthe journals would show to have voted for the measure.\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked--first, that we had the same Constitution then as now;\r\nsecondly, that we then had a case of invasion, and now we have a case of\r\nrebellion; and, thirdly, that the permanent right of the people to public\r\ndiscussion, the liberty of speech and of the press, the trial by jury, the\r\nlaw of evidence, and the habeas corpus suffered no detriment whatever\r\nby that conduct of General Jackson, or its subsequent approval by the\r\nAmerican Congress.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, let me say that, in my own discretion, I do not know whether I\r\nwould have ordered the arrest of Mr. Vallandigham. While I cannot shift\r\nthe responsibility from myself, I hold that, as a general rule, the\r\ncommander in the field is the better judge of the necessity in any\r\nparticular case. Of course I must practice a general directory and\r\nrevisory power in the matter.\r\n\r\nOne of the resolutions expresses the opinion of the meeting that arbitrary\r\narrests will have the effect to divide and distract those who should be\r\nunited in suppressing the rebellion, and I am specifically called on to\r\ndischarge Mr. Vallandigham. I regard this as, at least, a fair appeal to\r\nme on the expediency of exercising a constitutional power which I think\r\nexists. In response to such appeal I have to say, it gave me pain when\r\nI learned that Mr. Vallandigham had been arrested (that is, I was pained\r\nthat there should have seemed to be a necessity for arresting him), and\r\nthat it will afford me great pleasure to discharge him so soon as I can by\r\nany means believe the public safety will not suffer by it.\r\n\r\nI further say that, as the war progresses, it appears to me, opinion and\r\naction, which were in great confusion at first, take shape and fall into\r\nmore regular channels, so that the necessity for strong dealing with them\r\ngradually decreases. I have every reason to desire that it should cease\r\naltogether, and far from the least is my regard for the opinions and\r\nwishes of those who, like the meeting at Albany, declare their purpose\r\nto sustain the government in every constitutional and lawful measure to\r\nsuppress the rebellion. Still, I must continue to do so much as may seem\r\nto be required by the public safety.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

MALHIOT AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, June 19, 1863.\r\n\r\nMESSRS. B. B. MALHIOT, BRADISH JOHNSON, AND THOMAS COTTMAN.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:--Your letter, which follows, has been received and Considered.\r\n\r\n\"The undersigned, a committee appointed by the planters of the State of\r\nLouisiana, respectfully represent that they have been delegated to seek of\r\nthe General Government a full recognition of all the rights of the State\r\nas they existed previous to the passage of an act of secession, upon the\r\nprinciple of the existence of the State constitution unimpaired, and no\r\nlegal act having transpired that could in any way deprive them of the\r\nadvantages conferred by that constitution. Under this constitution the\r\nState wishes to return to its full allegiance, in the enjoyment of all\r\nrights and privileges exercised by the other States under the Federal\r\nConstitution. With the view of accomplishing the desired object, we\r\nfurther request that your Excellency will, as commander-in-chief of the\r\narmy of the United States, direct the Military Governor of Louisiana to\r\norder an election, in conformity with the constitution and laws of the\r\nState, on the first Monday of November next, for all State and Federal\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\n\"With high consideration and resect, we have the honor to subscribe\r\nourselves,\r\n\r\n\"Your obedient servants,\r\n\r\n     \"E. E. MALHIOT.\r\n     \"BRADISH JOHNSON.\r\n     \"THOMAS COTTMAN.\"\r\n\r\nSince receiving the letter, reliable information has reached me that a\r\nrespectable portion of the Louisiana people desire to amend their State\r\nconstitution, and contemplate holding a State convention for that object.\r\nThis fact alone, as it seems to me, is a sufficient reason why the General\r\nGovernment should not give the committal you seek to the existing State\r\nconstitution. I may add that, while I do not perceive how such committal\r\ncould facilitate our military operations in Louisiana, I really apprehend\r\nit might be so used as to embarrass them.\r\n\r\nAs to an election to be held next November, there is abundant time without\r\nany order or proclamation from me just now. The people of Louisiana shall\r\nnot lack an opportunity for a fair election for both Federal and State\r\nofficers by want of anything within my power to give them.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL J. M. SCHOFIELD.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON\r\n\r\nJune 22, 1863.\r\n\r\nGENERAL JOHN M. SCHOFIELD. MY DEAR SIR:--Your despatch, asking in\r\nsubstance whether, in case Missouri shall adopt gradual emancipation, the\r\nGeneral Government will protect slave owners in that species of property\r\nduring the short time it shall be permitted by the State to exist within\r\nit, has been received. Desirous as I am that emancipation shall be adopted\r\nby Missouri, and believing as I do that gradual can be made better than\r\nimmediate for both black and white, except when military necessity changes\r\nthe case, my impulse is to say that such protection would be given. I\r\ncannot know exactly what shape an act of emancipation may take. If the\r\nperiod from the initiation to the final end should be comparatively short,\r\nand the act should prevent persons being sold during that period into more\r\nlasting slavery, the whole would be easier. I do not wish to pledge the\r\nGeneral Government to the affirmative support of even temporary slavery\r\nbeyond what can be fairly claimed under the Constitution. I suppose,\r\nhowever, this is not desired, but that it is desired for the military\r\nforce of the United States, while in Missouri, to not be used in\r\nsubverting the temporarily reserved legal rights in slaves during the\r\nprogress of emancipation. This I would desire also. I have very earnestly\r\nurged the slave States to adopt emancipation; and it ought to be, and is,\r\nan object with me not to overthrow or thwart what any of them may in good\r\nfaith do to that end. You are therefore authorized to act in the spirit\r\nof this letter in conjunction with what may appear to be the military\r\nnecessities of your department. Although this letter will become public at\r\nsome time, it is not intended to be made so now.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, June 22, 1863\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HOOKER:\r\n\r\nOperator at Leesburg just now says: \"I heard very little firing this A.M.\r\nabout daylight, but it seems to have stopped now. It was in about the same\r\ndirection as yesterday, but farther off.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, June 23, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR:\r\n\r\nYou remember that Hon. W. D. Kelly and others are engaged in raising or\r\ntrying to raise some colored regiments in Philadelphia. The bearer of\r\nthis, Wilton M. Huput, is a friend of Judge Kelly, as appears by the\r\nletter of the latter. He is a private in the 112th Penn. and has been\r\ndisappointed in a reasonable expectation of one of the smaller offices.\r\nHe now wants to be a lieutenant in one of the colored regiments. If Judge\r\nKelly will say in writing he wishes to so have him, I am willing for him\r\nto be discharged from his present position, and be so appointed. If you\r\napprove, so indorse and let him carry the letter to Kelly.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

Don't think Kirby Smith\r\ntook Milliken's Bend since, allowing time to get the news to Joe Johnston\r\nand from him to Richmond. But it is not absolutely impossible. Also\r\nhave news from Banks to the 16th, I think. He had not run away then, nor\r\nthought of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

C., June 25, 1863.\r\n\r\nGENERAL PECK, Suffolk, Va.:\r\n\r\nColonel Derrom, of the Twenty-fifth New Jersey Volunteers, now mustered\r\nout, says there is a man in your hands under conviction for desertion,\r\nwho formerly belonged to the above named regiment, and whose name is\r\nTempleton--Isaac F. Templeton, I believe. The Colonel and others appeal to\r\nme for him. Please telegraph to me what is the condition of the case,\r\nand if he has not been executed send me the record of the trial and\r\nconviction.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

BOYLE, Cincinnati, O.:\r\n\r\nThere is nothing going on in Kentucky on the subject of which you\r\ntelegraph, except an enrolment.

C., June 28, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR GENERAL SCHENCK, Baltimore, Md.:\r\n\r\nEvery place in the Naval school subject to my appointment is full, and I\r\nhave one unredeemed promise of more than half a year's standing.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFURTHER DEMOCRATIC PARTY CRITICISM\r\n\r\nTO M. BIRCHARD AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., June 29,1863.\r\n\r\nMESSRS. M. BIRCHARD, DAVID A. HOUK, et al:\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:--The resolutions of the Ohio Democratic State convention, which\r\nyou present me, together with your introductory and closing remarks,\r\nbeing in position and argument mainly the same as the resolutions of the\r\nDemocratic meeting at Albany, New York, I refer you to my response to the\r\nlatter as meeting most of the points in the former.\r\n\r\nThis response you evidently used in preparing your remarks, and I desire\r\nno more than that it be used with accuracy. In a single reading of your\r\nremarks, I only discovered one inaccuracy in matter, which I suppose you\r\ntook from that paper. It is where you say: \"The undersigned are unable to\r\nagree with you in the opinion you have expressed that the Constitution is\r\ndifferent in time of insurrection or invasion from what it is in time of\r\npeace and public security.\"\r\n\r\nA recurrence to the paper will show you that I have not expressed the\r\nopinion you suppose. I expressed the opinion that the Constitution is\r\ndifferent in its application in cases of rebellion or invasion, involving\r\nthe public safety, from what it is in times of profound peace and\r\npublic security; and this opinion I adhere to, simply because, by the\r\nConstitution itself, things may be done in the one case which may not be\r\ndone in the other.\r\n\r\nI dislike to waste a word on a merely personal point, but I must\r\nrespectfully assure you that you will find yourselves at fault should\r\nyou ever seek for evidence to prove your assumption that I \"opposed in\r\ndiscussions before the people the policy of the Mexican war.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou say: \"Expunge from the Constitution this limitation upon the power\r\nof Congress to suspend the writ of habeas corpus, and yet the other\r\nguarantees of personal liberty would remain unchanged.\" Doubtless, if this\r\nclause of the Constitution, improperly called, as I think, a limitation\r\nupon the power of Congress, were expunged, the other guarantees would\r\nremain the same; but the question is not how those guarantees would stand\r\nwith that clause out of the Constitution, but how they stand with that\r\nclause remaining in it, in case of rebellion or invasion involving the\r\npublic safety. If the liberty could be indulged of expunging that clause,\r\nletter and spirit, I really think the constitutional argument would be\r\nwith you.\r\n\r\nMy general view on this question was stated in the Albany response, and\r\nhence I do not state it now. I only add that, as seems to me, the\r\nbenefit of the writ of habeas corpus is the great means through which the\r\nguarantees of personal liberty are conserved and made available in\r\nthe last resort; and corroborative of this view is the fact that Mr.\r\nVallandigham, in the very case in question, under the advice of able\r\nlawyers, saw not where else to go but to the habeas corpus. But by the\r\nConstitution the benefit of the writ of habeas corpus itself may be\r\nsuspended when, in case of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may\r\nrequire it.\r\n\r\nYou ask, in substance, whether I really claim that I may override all the\r\nguaranteed rights of individuals, on the plea of conserving the public\r\nsafety when I may choose to say the public safety requires it. This\r\nquestion, divested of the phraseology calculated to represent me as\r\nstruggling for an arbitrary personal prerogative, is either simply a\r\nquestion who shall decide, or an affirmation that nobody shall decide,\r\nwhat the public safety does require in cases of rebellion or invasion.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution contemplates the question as likely to occur for\r\ndecision, but it does not expressly declare who is to decide it. By\r\nnecessary implication, when rebellion or invasion comes, the decision is\r\nto be made from time to time; and I think the man whom, for the time, the\r\npeople have, under the Constitution, made the commander-in-chief of their\r\narmy and navy, is the man who holds the power and bears the responsibility\r\nof making it. If he uses the power justly, the same people will probably\r\njustify him; if he abuses it, he is in their hands to be dealt with by all\r\nthe modes they have reserved to themselves in the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe earnestness with which you insist that persons can only, in times\r\nof rebellion, be lawfully dealt with in accordance with the rules for\r\ncriminal trials and punishments in times of peace, induces me to add a\r\nword to what I said on that point in the Albany response.\r\n\r\nYou claim that men may, if they choose, embarrass those whose duty it is\r\nto combat a giant rebellion, and then be dealt with in turn only as if\r\nthere were no rebellion. The Constitution itself rejects this view. The\r\nmilitary arrests and detentions which have been made, including those of\r\nMr. Vallandigham, which are not different in principle from the others,\r\nhave been for prevention, and not for punishment--as injunctions to stay\r\ninjury, as proceedings to keep the peace; and hence, like proceedings\r\nin such cases and for like reasons, they have not been accompanied with\r\nindictments, or trials by juries, nor in a single case by any punishment\r\nwhatever, beyond what is purely incidental to the prevention. The original\r\nsentence of imprisonment in Mr. Vallandigham's case was to prevent injury\r\nto the military service only, and the modification of it was made as a\r\nless disagreeable mode to him of securing the same prevention.\r\n\r\nI am unable to perceive an insult to Ohio in the case of Mr. Vallandigham.\r\nQuite surely nothing of the sort was or is intended. I was wholly unaware\r\nthat Mr. Vallandigham was, at the time of his arrest, a candidate for the\r\nDemocratic nomination for governor until so informed by your reading to me\r\nthe resolutions of the convention. I am grateful to the State of Ohio for\r\nmany things, especially for the brave soldiers and officers she has given\r\nin the present national trial to the armies of the Union.\r\n\r\nYou claim, as I understand, that according to my own position in the\r\nAlbany response, Mr. Vallandigham should be released; and this because,\r\nas you claim, he has not damaged the military service by discouraging\r\nenlistments, encouraging desertions, or otherwise; and that if he had,\r\nhe should have been turned over to the civil authorities under the recent\r\nacts of Congress. I certainly do not know that Mr. Vallandigham has\r\nspecifically and by direct language advised against enlistments and in\r\nfavor of desertion and resistance to drafting.\r\n\r\nWe all know that combinations, armed in some instances, to resist the\r\narrest of deserters began several months ago; that more recently the like\r\nhas appeared in resistance to the enrolment preparatory to a draft; and\r\nthat quite a number of assassinations have occurred from the same animus.\r\nThese had to be met by military force, and this again has led to bloodshed\r\nand death. And now, under a sense of responsibility more weighty and\r\nenduring than any which is merely official, I solemnly declare my belief\r\nthat this hindrance of the military, including maiming and murder, is\r\ndue to the course in which Mr. Vallandigham has been engaged in a greater\r\ndegree than to any other cause; and it is due to him personally in a\r\ngreater degree than to any other one man.\r\n\r\nThese things have been notorious, known to all, and of course known to Mr.\r\nVallandigham. Perhaps I would not be wrong to say they originated with\r\nhis special friends and adherents. With perfect knowledge of them, he has\r\nfrequently if not constantly made speeches in Congress and before popular\r\nassemblies; and if it can be shown that, with these things staring him in\r\nthe face he has ever uttered a word of rebuke or counsel against them, it\r\nwill be a fact greatly in his favor with me, and one of which as yet I am\r\ntotally ignorant. When it is known that the whole burden of his speeches\r\nhas been to stir up men against the prosecution of the war, and that in\r\nthe midst of resistance to it he has not been known in any instance to\r\ncounsel against such resistance, it is next to impossible to repel the\r\ninference that he has counseled directly in favor of it.\r\n\r\nWith all this before their eyes, the convention you represent have\r\nnominated Mr. Vallandigham for governor of Ohio, and both they and\r\nyou have declared the purpose to sustain the national Union by all\r\nconstitutional means. But of course they and you in common reserve to\r\nyourselves to decide what are constitutional means; and, unlike the Albany\r\nmeeting, you omit to state or intimate that in your opinion an army is a\r\nconstitutional means of saving the Union against a rebellion, or even to\r\nintimate that you are conscious of an existing rebellion being in progress\r\nwith the avowed object of destroying that very Union. At the same time\r\nyour nominee for governor, in whose behalf you appeal, is known to you\r\nand to the world to declare against the use of an army to suppress the\r\nrebellion. Your own attitude, therefore, encourages desertion, resistance\r\nto the draft, and the like, because it teaches those who incline to desert\r\nand to escape the draft to believe it is your purpose to protect them, and\r\nto hope that you will become strong enough to do so.\r\n\r\nAfter a short personal intercourse with you, gentlemen of the committee,\r\nI cannot say I think you desire this effect to follow your attitude; but\r\nI assure your that both friends and enemies of the Union look upon it in\r\nthis light. It is a substantial hope, and by consequence a real strength\r\nto the enemy. If it is a false hope, and one which you would willingly\r\ndispel, I will make the way exceedingly easy.\r\n\r\nI send you duplicates of this letter in order that you, or a majority of\r\nyou, may, if you choose, indorse your names upon one of them and return it\r\nthus indorsed to me with the understanding that those signing are thereby\r\ncommitted to the following propositions and to nothing else:\r\n\r\n1. That there is now a rebellion in the United States, the object and\r\ntendency of which is to destroy the National Union; and that, in your\r\nopinion, an army and navy are constitutional means for suppressing that\r\nrebellion;\r\n\r\n2. That no one of you will do anything which, in his own judgment,\r\nwill tend to hinder the increase, or favor the decrease, or lessen the\r\nefficiency of the army or navy while engaged in the effort to suppress\r\nthat rebellion; and\r\n\r\n3. That each of you will, in his sphere, do all he can to have the\r\nofficers, soldiers, and seamen of the army and navy, while engaged in\r\nthe effort to suppress the rebellion, paid, fed, clad, and otherwise well\r\nprovided for and supported.\r\n\r\nAnd with the further understanding that upon receiving the letter and\r\nnames thus indorsed, I will cause them to be published, which publication\r\nshall be, within itself, a revocation of the order in relation to Mr.\r\nVallandigham. It will not escape observation that I consent to the release\r\nof Mr. Vallandigham upon terms not embracing any pledge from him or from\r\nothers as to what he will or will not do. I do this because he is not\r\npresent to speak for himself, or to authorize others to speak for him;\r\nand because I should expect that on his returning he would not put himself\r\npractically in antagonism with the position of his friends. But I do it\r\nchiefly because I thereby prevail on other influential gentlemen of Ohio\r\nto so define their position as to be of immense value to the army--thus\r\nmore than compensating for the consequences of any mistake in allowing Mr.\r\nVallandigham to return; so that, on the whole, the public safety will not\r\nhave suffered by it. Still, in regard to Mr. Vallandigham and all others,\r\nI must hereafter, as heretofore, do so much as the public safety may seem\r\nto require.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be respectfully yours, etc.,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR PARKER.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, June 30, 1863. 10.55\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR PARKER, Trenton, N.J.:\r\n\r\nYour despatch of yesterday received. I really think the attitude of the\r\nenemy's army in Pennsylvania presents us the best opportunity we have had\r\nsince the war began. I think you will not see the foe in New Jersey. I beg\r\nyou to be assured that no one out of my position can know so well as if\r\nhe were in it the difficulties and involvements of replacing General\r\nMcClellan in command, and this aside from any imputations upon him.\r\n\r\nPlease accept my sincere thanks for what you have done and are doing to\r\nget troops forward.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO A. K. McCLURE.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, June 30, 1863.\r\n\r\nA. K. McCLURE, Philadelphia:\r\n\r\nDo we gain anything by opening one leak to stop another? Do we gain\r\nanything by quieting one merely to open another, and probably a larger\r\none?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL COUCH. [Cipher] WASHINGTON CITY, June 30, 1863. 3.23\r\nP.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL COUCH, Harrisburg, Pa.:\r\n\r\nI judge by absence of news that the enemy is not crossing or pressing up\r\nto the Susquehanna. Please tell me what you know of his movements.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL D. HUNTER.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, June 30, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HUNTER.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GENERAL:--I have just received your letter of the 25th of June.\r\n\r\nI assure you, and you may feel authorized in stating, that the recent\r\nchange of commanders in the Department of the South was made for no\r\nreasons which convey any imputation upon your known energy, efficiency,\r\nand patriotism; but for causes which seemed sufficient, while they were in\r\nno degree incompatible with the respect and esteem in which I have always\r\nheld you as a man and an officer.\r\n\r\nI cannot, by giving my consent to a publication of whose details I know\r\nnothing, assume the responsibility of whatever you may write. In this\r\nmatter your own sense of military propriety must be your guide, and the\r\nregulations of the service your rule of conduct.\r\n\r\nI am very truly your friend,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL BURNSIDE.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., July 3, 1863\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BURNSIDE, Cincinnati, Ohio:\r\n\r\nPrivate Downey, of the Twentieth or Twenty-sixth Kentucky Infantry,\r\nis said to have been sentenced to be shot for desertion to-day. If so,\r\nrespite the execution until I can see the record.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

LINCOLN, Esq., Cambridge, Mass.:\r\n\r\nDon't be uneasy. Your mother very slightly hurt by her fall.\r\n\r\nA.L.\r\n\r\nPlease send at once.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANNOUNCEMENT OF NEWS FROM GETTYSBURG.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON,\r\n\r\nJuly 4, 10.30 A.M.\r\n\r\nThe President announces to the country that news from the Army of the\r\nPotomac, up to 10 P.M. of the 3d, is such as to cover that army with the\r\nhighest honor, to promise a great success to the cause of the Union, and\r\nto claim the condolence of all for the many gallant fallen; and that\r\nfor this he especially desires that on this day He whose will, not\r\nours, should ever be done be everywhere remembered and reverenced with\r\nprofoundest gratitude.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL FRENCH. [Cipher] WAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C.,\r\nJuly 5, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL FRENCH, Fredericktown, Md.:\r\n\r\nI see your despatch about destruction of pontoons. Cannot the enemy ford\r\nthe river?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTINUED FAILURE TO PURSUE ENEMY\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nSOLDIERS' HOME, WASHINGTON, JULY 6 1863.7 P.M.,\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK:\r\n\r\nI left the telegraph office a good deal dissatisfied. You know I did not\r\nlike the phrase--in Orders, No. 68, I believe--\"Drive the invaders from\r\nour soil.\" Since that, I see a despatch from General French, saying the\r\nenemy is crossing his wounded over the river in flats, without saying\r\nwhy he does not stop it, or even intimating a thought that it ought to\r\nbe stopped. Still later, another despatch from General Pleasonton, by\r\ndirection of General Meade, to General French, stating that the main army\r\nis halted because it is believed the rebels are concentrating \"on the\r\nroad towards Hagerstown, beyond Fairfield,\" and is not to move until it is\r\nascertained that the rebels intend to evacuate Cumberland Valley.\r\n\r\nThese things appear to me to be connected with a purpose to cover\r\nBaltimore and Washington and to get the enemy across the river again\r\nwithout a further collision, and they do not appear connected with a\r\npurpose to prevent his crossing and to destroy him. I do fear the former\r\npurpose is acted upon and the latter rejected.\r\n\r\nIf you are satisfied the latter purpose is entertained, and is judiciously\r\npursued, I am content. If you are not so satisfied, please look to it.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESPONSE TO A SERENADE,\r\n\r\nJULY 7, 1863.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS:--I am very glad indeed to see you to-night, and yet I\r\nwill not say I thank you for this call; but I do most sincerely thank\r\nAlmighty God for the occasion on which you have called. How long ago is it\r\nEighty-odd years since, on the Fourth of July, for the first time in the\r\nhistory of the world, a nation, by its representatives, assembled and\r\ndeclared as a self-evident truth \"that all men are created equal.\" That\r\nwas the birthday of the United States of America. Since then the Fourth\r\nof July has had several very peculiar recognitions. The two men most\r\ndistinguished in the framing and support of the Declaration were Thomas\r\nJefferson and John Adams, the one having penned it, and the other\r\nsustained it the most forcibly in debate--the only two of the fifty-five\r\nwho signed it and were elected Presidents of the United States. Precisely\r\nfifty years after they put their hands to the paper, it pleased\r\nAlmighty God to take both from this stage of action. This was indeed an\r\nextraordinary and remarkable event in our history. Another President, five\r\nyears after, was called from this stage of existence on the same day and\r\nmonth of the year; and now on this last Fourth of July just passed, when\r\nwe have a gigantic rebellion, at the bottom of which is an effort to\r\noverthrow the principle that all men were created equal, we have the\r\nsurrender of a most powerful position and army on that very day. And not\r\nonly so, but in the succession of battles in Pennsylvania, near to us,\r\nthrough three days, so rapidly fought that they might be called one great\r\nbattle, on the first, second, and third of the month of July; and on the\r\nfourth the cohorts of those who opposed the Declaration that all men are\r\ncreated equal, \"turned tail\" and run.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, this is a glorious theme, and the occasion for a speech, but I\r\nam not prepared to make one worthy of the occasion. I would like to speak\r\nin terms of praise due to the many brave officers and soldiers who have\r\nfought in the cause of the Union and liberties of their country from the\r\nbeginning of the war. These are trying occasions, not only in success,\r\nbut for the want of success. I dislike to mention the name of one single\r\nofficer, lest I might do wrong to those I might forget. Recent events\r\nbring up glorious names, and particularly prominent ones; but these I will\r\nnot mention. Having said this much, I will now take the music.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSURRENDER OF VICKSBURG TO GENERAL GRANT\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM FROM GENERAL HALLECK TO GENERAL G. C. MEADE.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., July 7, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Army of the Potomac:\r\n\r\nI have received from the President the following note, which I\r\nrespectfully communicate:\r\n\r\n\"We have certain information that Vicksburg surrendered to General Grant\r\non the Fourth of July. Now if General Meade can complete his work, so\r\ngloriously prosecuted this far, by the literal or substantial destruction\r\nof Lee's army, the rebellion will be over.\r\n\r\n\"Yours truly,\r\n\r\n\"A. LINCOLN.\"\r\n\r\nH. W. HALLECK. General-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM FROM GENERAL HALLECK TO GENERAL G. C. MEADE.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., July 8, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Frederick, Md.:\r\n\r\nThere is reliable information that the enemy is crossing at Williamsport.\r\nThe opportunity to attack his divided forces should not be lost. The\r\nPresident is urgent and anxious that your army should move against him by\r\nforced marches.\r\n\r\nH. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL THOMAS.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, July 8, 1863.12.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nGENERAL LORENZO THOMAS, Harrisburg, Pa.:\r\n\r\nYour despatch of this morning to the Secretary of War is before me. The\r\nforces you speak of will be of no imaginable service if they cannot go\r\nforward with a little more expedition. Lee is now passing the Potomac\r\nfaster than the forces you mention are passing Carlisle. Forces now beyond\r\nCarlisle to be joined by regiments still at Harrisburg, and the united\r\nforce again to join Pierce somewhere, and the whole to move down the\r\nCumberland Valley, will in my unprofessional opinion be quite as likely to\r\ncapture the \"man in the moon\" as any part of Lee's army.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

LOWE, San Francisco, Cal.:\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that General Meade, now commanding the Army of the\r\nPotomac, beat Lee at Gettysburg, Pa., at the end of a three days' battle,\r\nand that the latter is now crossing the Potomac at Williamsport over the\r\nswollen stream and with poor means of crossing, and closely pressed\r\nby Meade. We also have despatches rendering it entirely certain that\r\nVicksburg surrendered to General Grant on the glorious old 4th.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO L. SWETT AND P. F.

DUBOIS, Springfield, Ill.:\r\n\r\nIt is certain that, after three days' fighting at Gettysburg, Lee withdrew\r\nand made for the Potomac, that he found the river so swollen as to\r\nprevent his crossing; that he is still this side, near Hagerstown and\r\nWilliamsport, preparing to defend himself; and that Meade is close upon\r\nhim, and preparing to attack him, heavy skirmishing having occurred nearly\r\nall day yesterday.\r\n\r\nI am more than satisfied with what has happened north of the Potomac so\r\nfar, and am anxious and hopeful for what is to come.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n     [Nothing came! Lee was allowed to escape again and the war\r\n     went on for another two years.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL GRANT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July 13, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL GRANT:\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GENERAL:--I do not remember that you and I ever met personally.\r\nI write this now as a grateful acknowledgment of the almost inestimable\r\nservice you have done the Country. I write to say a word further. When you\r\nfirst reached the vicinity of Vicksburg, I thought you should do what you\r\nfinally did--march the troops across the neck, run the batteries with the\r\ntransports, and thus go below; and I never had any faith except a general\r\nhope that you knew better than I, that the Yazoo Pass expedition and the\r\nlike could succeed. When you dropped below, and took Port Gibson, Grand\r\nGulf, and vicinity, I thought you should go down the river and join\r\nGeneral Banks; and when you turned northward, east of the Big Black, I\r\nfeared it was a mistake. I now wish to make the personal acknowledgment\r\nthat you were right and I was wrong.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. M. SCHOFIELD.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, July 13, 1863.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SCHOFIELD. St. Louis, Mo.:\r\n\r\nI regret to learn of the arrest of the Democrat editor. I fear this loses\r\nyou the middle position I desired you to occupy. I have not learned which\r\nof the two letters I wrote you it was that the Democrat published, but I\r\ncare very little for the publication of any letter I have written. Please\r\nspare me the trouble this is likely to bring.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSON IN COLLEGE DOES NOT WRITE HIS PARENTS\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO R. T.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTIMATION OF ARMISTICE PROPOSALS\r\n\r\nFROM JAMES R. GILMORE TO GOVERNOR VANCE OF NORTH CAROLINA,\r\n\r\nWITH THE PRESIDENT'S INDORSEMENT.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT'S ROOM, WHITE HOUSE, WASHINGTON,\r\n\r\nJuly [15?] 1864.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS EXCELLENCY ZEBULON B. VANCE.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--My former business partner, Mr. Frederic Kidder, of Boston,\r\nhas forwarded to me a letter he has recently received from his brother,\r\nEdward Kidder, of Wilmington, in which (Edward Kidder) says that he has\r\nhad an interview with you in which you expressed an anxiety for any peace\r\ncompatible with honor; that you regard slavery as already dead, and the\r\nestablishment of the Confederacy as hopeless; and that you should exert\r\nall your influence to bring about any reunion that would admit the South\r\non terms of perfect equality with the North.\r\n\r\nOn receipt of this letter I lost no time in laying it before the President\r\nof the United States, who expressed great gratification at hearing such\r\nsentiments from you, one of the most influential and honored of the\r\nSouthern governors, and he desires me to say that he fully shares your\r\nanxiety for the restoration of peace between the States and for a reunion\r\nof all the States on the basis of the abolition of slavery--the bone we\r\nare fighting over--and the full reinstatement of every Confederate citizen\r\nin all the rights of citizenship in our common country. These points\r\nconceded, the President authorizes me to say that he will be glad to\r\nreceive overtures from any man, or body of men, who have authority to\r\ncontrol the armies of the Confederacy; and that he and the United States\r\nCongress will be found very liberal on all collateral points that may come\r\nup in the settlement.\r\n\r\nHis views on the collateral points that may naturally arise, the President\r\ndesires me to say he will communicate to you through me if you should\r\nsuggest the personal interview that Mr. Edward Kidder recommends in his\r\nletter to his brother. In that case you will please forward to me, through\r\nMr. Kidder, your official permit, as Governor of North Carolina, to enter\r\nand leave the State, and to remain in it in safety during the pendency\r\nof these negotiations, which, I suppose, should be conducted in entire\r\nsecrecy until they assume an official character. With high consideration,\r\nI am,\r\n\r\nSincerely yours,\r\n\r\nJAMES R. GILMORE.\r\n\r\n [Indorsement.]\r\n\r\nThis letter has been written in my presence, has been read by me, and has\r\nmy entire approval. A.L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION FOR THANKSGIVING, JULY 15, 1863\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nIt has pleased Almighty God to hearken to the supplications and prayers of\r\nan afflicted people, and to vouchsafe to the army and navy of the United\r\nStates victories on land and on the sea so signal and so effective as\r\nto furnish reasonable grounds for augmented confidence that the Union of\r\nthese States will be maintained, their Constitution preserved, and their\r\npeace and prosperity permanently restored. But these victories have\r\nbeen accorded not without sacrifices of life, limb, health, and liberty,\r\nincurred by brave, loyal, and patriotic citizens. Domestic affliction\r\nin every part of the country follows in the train of these fearful\r\nbereavements. It is meet and right to recognize and confess the presence\r\nof the Almighty Father, and the power of His hand equally in these\r\ntriumphs and in these sorrows.\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, be it known that I do set apart Thursday, the 6th day of\r\nAugust next, to be observed as a day for national thanksgiving, praise,\r\nand prayer, and I invite the people of the United States to assemble on\r\nthat occasion in their customary places of worship, and, in the forms\r\napproved by their own consciences, render the homage due to the Divine\r\nMajesty for the wonderful things He has done in the nation's behalf, and\r\ninvoke the influence of His Holy Spirit to subdue the anger which has\r\nproduced and so long sustained a needless and cruel rebellion, to change\r\nthe hearts of the insurgents, to guide the counsels of the Government with\r\nwisdom adequate to so great a national emergency, and to visit with tender\r\ncare and consolation throughout the length and breadth of our land all\r\nthose who, through the vicissitudes of marches, voyages, battles, and\r\nsieges have been, brought to suffer in mind, body, or estate, and finally\r\nto lead the whole nation through the paths of repentance and submission\r\nto the Divine Will back to the perfect enjoyment of union and fraternal\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the\r\nUnited States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this fifteenth day of July, in the year\r\nof our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and of the\r\nindependence of the United States of America the eighty-eighth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy, the President  WILLIAM H. SEWARD,\r\n  Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO L. SWETT.\r\n\r\n[Cipher.]\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, July 15, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. L SWETT, San Francisco, Cal.:\r\n\r\nMany persons are telegraphing me from California, begging me for the peace\r\nof the State to suspend the military enforcement of the writ of possession\r\nin the Almaden case, while you are the single one who urges the contrary.\r\nYou know I would like to oblige you, but it seems to me my duty in this\r\ncase is the other way.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

SIMON CAMERON, Harrisburg, Pa.:\r\n\r\nYour despatch of yesterday received. Lee was already across the river\r\nwhen you sent it. I would give much to be relieved of the impression that\r\nMeade, Couch, Smith, and all since the battle at Gettysburg, have striven\r\nonly to get Lee over the river without another fight. Please tell me,\r\nif you know, who was the one corps commander who was for fighting in the\r\ncouncil of war on Sunday night.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO J. O.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL LANE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July 17 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. S. H. LANE.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Governor Carney has not asked to [have] General Blunt\r\nremoved, or interfered with, in his military operations. He has asked that\r\nhe, the Governor, be allowed to commission officers for troops raised in\r\nKansas, as other governors of loyal States do; and I think he is right in\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nHe has asked that General Blunt shall not take persons charged with civil\r\ncrimes out of the hands of the courts and turn them over to mobs to be\r\nhung; and I think he is right in this also. He has asked that General\r\nEwing's department be extended to include all Kansas; and I have not\r\ndetermined whether this is right or not.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR MORTON.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., July 18, 1863.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR O. P. MORTON, Indianapolis:\r\n\r\nWhat do you remember about the case of John O. Brown, convicted of\r\nmutinous conduct and sentenced to death? What do you desire about it?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR PARKER\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON\r\n\r\nJuly 20, 1863.\r\n\r\nHIS EXCELLENCY JOEL PARKER, Governor of New Jersey.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Yours of the 15th has been received, and considered by the\r\nSecretary of War and myself. I was pained to be informed this morning by\r\nthe Provost-Marshal-General that New Jersey is now behind twelve thousand,\r\nirrespective of the draft. I did not have time to ascertain by what rules\r\nthis was made out; and I shall be very glad if it shall, by any means,\r\nprove to be incorrect. He also tells me that eight thousand will be about\r\nthe quota of New Jersey on the first draft; and the Secretary of War\r\nsays the first draft in that State would not be made for some time in any\r\nevent. As every man obtained otherwise lessens the draft so much, and this\r\nmay supersede it altogether, I hope you will push forward your volunteer\r\nregiments as fast as possible.\r\n\r\nIt is a very delicate matter to postpone the draft in one State, because\r\nof the argument it furnishes others to have postponement also. If we could\r\nhave a reason in one case which would be good if presented in all cases,\r\nwe could act upon it.\r\n\r\nI will thank you, therefore, to inform me, if you can, by what day, at\r\nthe earliest, you can promise to have ready to be mustered into the United\r\nStates service the eight thousand men.\r\n\r\nIf you can make a reliable promise (I mean one which you can rely on\r\nyourself) of this sort, it will be of great value, if the day is not too\r\nremote.\r\n\r\nI beg you to be assured I wish to avoid the difficulties you dread as much\r\nas yourself.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL SCHOFIELD.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON D.C. JULY 20, 1863\r\n\r\nMAJOR GENERAL JOHN M. SCHOFIELD.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GENERAL:--I have received and read your letter of the 14th of\r\nJuly.\r\n\r\nI think the suggestion you make, of discontinuing proceedings against\r\nMr. McKee, a very proper one. While I admit that there is an apparent\r\nimpropriety in the publication of the letter mentioned, without my consent\r\nor yours, it is still a case where no evil could result, and which I am\r\nentirely willing to overlook.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. M. SCHOFIELD\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C. JULY 22, 1863\r\n\r\nMAJOR GENERAL SCHOFIELD, St. Louis, Mo.:\r\n\r\nThe following despatch has been placed in my hands. Please look to the\r\nsubject of it.\r\n\r\nLEXINGTON, Mo., JULY 21, 1863 HON. S C. POMEROY: Under Orders No.63 the\r\nsheriff is arresting slaves of rebels inside our lines, and returning them\r\nin great numbers. Can he do it? Answer. GOULD.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO POSTMASTER-GENERAL BLAIR\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\r\n\r\nJULY 24, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. POSTMASTER-GENERAL\r\n\r\nSIR:-Yesterday little indorsements of mine went to you in two cases\r\nof postmasterships sought for widows whose husbands have fallen in the\r\nbattles of this war. These cases occurring on the same day brought me to\r\nreflect more attentively than I had before done, as to what is fairly due\r\nfrom us herein the dispensing of patronage toward the men who, by fighting\r\nour battles, bear the chief burden of serving our country. My conclusion\r\nis that, other claims and qualifications being equal, they have the better\r\nright and this is especially applicable to the disabled and the soldier,\r\ndeceased soldier's family.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY OF THE NAVY.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July 25, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF THE NAVY.\r\n\r\nSIR:--Certain matters have come to my notice, and considered by me, which\r\ninduce me to believe that it will conduce to the public interest for\r\nyou to add to the general instructions given to our naval commanders in\r\nrelation to contraband trade propositions substantially as follows, to\r\nwit:\r\n\r\nFirst. You will avoid the reality, and as far as possible the appearance,\r\nof using any neutral port to watch neutral vessels and then to dart out\r\nand seize them on their departure.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--Complaint is made that this has been practiced at the port of St\r\nThomas, which practice, if it exists, is disapproved and must cease.\r\n\r\nSecond. You will not in any case detain the crew of a captured neutral\r\nvessel or any other subject of a neutral power on board such vessel,\r\nas prisoners of war or otherwise, except the small number necessary as\r\nwitnesses in the prize court.\r\n\r\nNOTE.-The practice here forbidden is also charged to exist, which, if\r\ntrue, is disapproved and must cease.\r\n\r\nMy dear sir, it is not intended to be insinuated that you have been\r\nremiss in the performance of the arduous and responsible duties of your\r\ndepartment, which, I take pleasure in affirming, has in your hands been\r\nconducted with admirable success. Yet, while your subordinates are almost\r\nof necessity brought into angry collision with the subjects of foreign\r\nstates, the representatives of those states and yourself do not come into\r\nimmediate contact for the purpose of keeping the peace, in spite of such\r\ncollisions. At that point there is an ultimate and heavy responsibility\r\nupon me.\r\n\r\nWhat I propose is in strict accordance with international law, and is\r\ntherefore unobjectionable; whilst, if it does no other good, it will\r\ncontribute to sustain a considerable portion of the present British\r\nministry in their places, who, if displaced, are sure to be replaced by\r\nothers more unfavorable to us.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER TO GOVERNOR PARKER.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\r\n\r\nJuly 25, 1863.\r\n\r\nHIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR JOEL PARKER.\r\n\r\nSIR:--Yours of the 21st is received, and I have taken time and considered\r\nand discussed the subject with the Secretary of War and Provost-Marshal\r\nGeneral, in order, if possible, to make you a more favorable answer than I\r\nfinally find myself able to do.\r\n\r\nIt is a vital point with us to not have a special stipulation with the\r\ngovernor of any one State, because it would breed trouble in many, if not\r\nall, other States; and my idea was when I wrote you, as it still is, to\r\nget a point of time to which we could wait, on the reason that we were not\r\nready ourselves to proceed, and which might enable you to raise the quota\r\nof your State, in whole, or in large part, without the draft. The points\r\nof time you fix are much farther off than I had hoped. We might have got\r\nalong in the way I have indicated for twenty, or possibly thirty, days. As\r\nit stands, the best I can say is that every volunteer you will present us\r\nwithin thirty days from this date, fit and ready to be mustered into the\r\nUnited States service, on the usual terms, shall be pro tanto an abatement\r\nof your quota of the draft. That quota I can now state at eight thousand\r\nseven hundred and eighty-three (8783). No draft from New Jersey, other\r\nthan for the above quota, will be made before an additional draft, common\r\nto [all] the States, shall be required; and I may add that if we get well\r\nthrough with this draft, I entertain a strong hope that any further\r\none may never be needed. This expression of hope, however, must not be\r\nconstrued into a promise.\r\n\r\nAs to conducting the draft by townships, I find it would require such a\r\nwaste of labor already done, and such an additional amount of it, and such\r\na loss of time, as to make it, I fear, inadmissible.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nP. S.--Since writing the above, getting additional information, I\r\nam enabled to say that the draft may be made in subdistricts, as the\r\nenrolment has been made, or is in process of making. This will amount\r\npractically to drafting by townships, as the enrollment subdistricts are\r\ngenerally about the extent of townships. A.L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo GENERAL G. G. MEADE. (Private.)\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July 27, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEADE:\r\n\r\nI have not thrown General Hooker away; and therefore I would like to know\r\nwhether it would be agreeable to you, all things considered, for him to\r\ntake a corps under you, if he himself is willing to do so. Write me in\r\nperfect freedom, with the assurance that I will not subject you to any\r\nembarrassment by making your letter or its contents known to any one. I\r\nwish to know your wishes before I decide whether to break the subject\r\nto him. Do not lean a hair's breadth against your own feelings, or your\r\njudgment of the public service, on the idea of gratifying me.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL A. B. BURNSIDE.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, July 27, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BURNSIDE, Cincinnati, O.:\r\n\r\nLet me explain. In General Grant's first despatch after the fall of\r\nVicksburg, he said, among other things, he would send the Ninth Corps to\r\nyou. Thinking it would be pleasant to you, I asked the Secretary of War to\r\ntelegraph you the news. For some reasons never mentioned to us by General\r\nGrant, they have not been sent, though we have seen outside intimations\r\nthat they took part in the expedition against Jackson. General Grant is\r\na copious worker and fighter, but a very meager writer or telegrapher.\r\nNo doubt he changed his purpose in regard to the Ninth Corps for some\r\nsufficient reason, but has forgotten to notify us of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, July 29, 1863\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK:\r\n\r\nSeeing General Meade's despatch of yesterday to yourself causes me to fear\r\nthat he supposes the Government here is demanding of him to bring on a\r\ngeneral engagement with Lee as soon as possible. I am claiming no such\r\nthing of him. In fact, my judgment is against it; which judgment, of\r\ncourse, I will yield if yours and his are the contrary. If he could not\r\nsafely engage Lee at Williamsport, it seems absurd to suppose he can\r\nsafely engage him now, when he has scarcely more than two thirds of\r\nthe force he had at Williamsport, while it must be that Lee has been\r\nreinforced. True, I desired General Meade to pursue Lee across the\r\nPotomac, hoping, as has proved true, that he would thereby clear the\r\nBaltimore and Ohio Railroad, and get some advantages by harassing him on\r\nhis retreat. These being past, I am unwilling he should now get into a\r\ngeneral engagement on the impression that we here are pressing him, and\r\nI shall be glad for you to so inform him, unless your own judgment is\r\nagainst it.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nH. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July 29, 1863\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nSIR:--Can we not renew the effort to organize a force to go to western\r\nTexas?\r\n\r\nPlease consult with the general-in-chief on the subject.\r\n\r\nIf the Governor of New Jersey shall furnish any new regiments, might not\r\nthey be put into such an expedition? Please think of it.\r\n\r\nI believe no local object is now more desirable.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER OF RETALIATION.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July 30, 1863.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of every government to give protection to its citizens, of\r\nwhatever class, color, or condition, and especially to those who are duly\r\norganized as soldiers in the public service. The law of nations and the\r\nusages and customs of war, as carried on by civilized powers, permit no\r\ndistinction as to color in the treatment of prisoners of war as public\r\nenemies. To sell or enslave any captured person, on account of his color\r\nand for no offense against the laws of war, is a relapse into barbarism,\r\nand a crime against the civilization of the age.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the United States will give the same protection to all\r\nits soldiers; and if the enemy shall sell or enslave any one because of\r\nhis color, the offense shall be punished by retaliation upon the enemy's\r\nprisoners in our possession.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore ordered that for every soldier of the United States killed\r\nin violation of the laws of war, a rebel soldier shall be executed; and\r\nfor every one enslaved by the enemy or sold into slavery, a rebel soldier\r\nshall be placed at hard labor on the public works, and continued at such\r\nlabor until the other shall be released and receive the treatment due to a\r\nprisoner of war.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL S. A. HURLBUT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, July 31, 1863.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GENERAL HURLBUT:\r\n\r\nYour letter by Mr. Dana was duly received. I now learn that your\r\nresignation has reached the War Department. I also learn that an active\r\ncommand has been assigned you by General Grant. The Secretary of War and\r\nGeneral Halleck are very partial to you, as you know I also am. We all\r\nwish you to reconsider the question of resigning; not that we would\r\nwish to retain you greatly against your wish and interest, but that your\r\ndecision may be at least a very well-considered one.\r\n\r\nI understand that Senator [William K.] Sebastian, of Arkansas, thinks of\r\noffering to resume his place in the Senate. Of course the Senate, and not\r\nI, would decide whether to admit or reject him. Still I should feel great\r\ninterest in the question. It may be so presented as to be one of the very\r\ngreatest national importance; and it may be otherwise so presented as to\r\nbe of no more than temporary personal consequence to him.\r\n\r\nThe Emancipation Proclamation applies to Arkansas. I think it is valid\r\nin law, and will be so held by the courts. I think I shall not retract\r\nor repudiate it. Those who shall have tasted actual freedom I believe can\r\nnever be slaves or quasi-slaves again. For the rest, I believe some plan\r\nsubstantially being gradual emancipation would be better for both white\r\nand black. The Missouri plan recently adopted, I do not object to on\r\naccount of the time for ending the institution; but I am sorry the\r\nbeginning should have been postponed for seven years, leaving all that\r\ntime to agitate for the repeal of the whole thing. It should begin at\r\nonce, giving at least the new-born a vested interest in freedom which\r\ncould not be taken away. If Senator Sebastian could come with something\r\nof this sort from Arkansas, I, at least, should take great interest in his\r\ncase; and I believe a single individual will have scarcely done the world\r\nso great a service. See him if you can, and read this to him; but charge\r\nhim not to make it public for the present. Write me again.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM FROM GOVERNOR SEYMOUR.\r\n\r\nALBANY, August 1, 1863. Recvd 2 P.M.\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nI ask that the draft be suspended in this State until I can send you a\r\ncommunication I am preparing.\r\n\r\nHORATIO SEYMOUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR SEYMOUR\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., August 1, 1863. 4 P.M.\r\n\r\nHIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR SEYMOUR, Albany, N.Y.:\r\n\r\nBy what day may I expect your communication to reach me? Are you anxious\r\nabout any part except the city and vicinity?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL FOSTER.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August 3, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL FOSTER (or whoever may be in command of the military\r\ndepartment with headquarters at Fort Monroe, Va.):\r\n\r\nIf Dr. Wright, on trial at Norfolk, has been or shall be convicted, send\r\nme a transcript of his trial and conviction, and do not let execution be\r\ndone upon him until my further order.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL N. P. BANKS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August 5,1863.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GENERAL BANKS:\r\n\r\nWhile I very well know what I would be glad for Louisiana to do, it is\r\nquite a different thing for me to assume direction of the matter. I would\r\nbe glad for her to make a new constitution, recognizing the emancipation\r\nproclamation, and adopting emancipation in those parts of the State to\r\nwhich the proclamation does not apply. And while she is at it, I think it\r\nwould not be objectionable for her to adopt some practical system by which\r\nthe two races could gradually live themselves out of their old relation to\r\neach other, and both come out better prepared for the new. Education\r\nfor young blacks should be included in the plan. After all, the power or\r\nelement of \"contract\" may be sufficient for this probationary period, and\r\nby its simplicity and flexibility may be the better.\r\n\r\nAs an antislavery man, I have a motive to desire emancipation which\r\nproslavery men do not have but even they have strong enough reason to\r\nthus place themselves again under the shield of the Union, and to thus\r\nperpetually hedge against the recurrence of the scenes through which we\r\nare now passing.\r\n\r\nGovernor Shepley has informed me that Mr. Durant is now taking a registry,\r\nwith a view to the election of a constitutional convention in Louisiana.\r\nThis, to me, appears proper. If such convention were to ask my views, I\r\ncould present little else than what I now say to you. I think the thing\r\nshould be pushed forward, so that, if possible, its mature work may reach\r\nhere by the meeting of Congress.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I think I shall not, in any event, retract the\r\nemancipation proclamation: nor, as executive, ever return to slavery any\r\nperson who is free by the terms of that proclamation, or by any of the\r\nacts of Congress.\r\n\r\nIf Louisiana shall send members to Congress, their admission to seats\r\nwill depend, as you know, upon the respective Houses, and not upon the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR SEYMOUR.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August 7, 1863.\r\n\r\nHIS EXCELLENCY HORATIO SEYMOUR, Governor of New York:\r\n\r\nYour communication of the 3rd instant has been received and attentively\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nI cannot consent to suspend the draft in New York, as you request,\r\nbecause, among other reasons, time is too important.\r\n\r\nBy the figures you send, which I presume are correct, the twelve districts\r\nrepresented fall into two classes of eight and four respectively. The\r\ndisparity of the quotas for the draft in these two classes is certainly\r\nvery striking, being the difference between an average of 2200 in one\r\nclass and 4864 in the other. Assuming that the districts are equal one to\r\nanother in entire population, as required by the plan on which they were\r\nmade, this disparity is such as to require attention. Much of it, however,\r\nI suppose will be accounted for by the fact that so many more persons fit\r\nfor soldiers are in the city than are in the country who have too recently\r\narrived from other parts of the United States and from Europe to be either\r\nincluded in the census of 1860, or to have voted in 1862. Still, making\r\ndue allowance for this, I am yet unwilling to stand upon it as an entirely\r\nsufficient explanation of the great disparity.\r\n\r\nI shall direct the draft to proceed in all the districts, drawing,\r\nhowever, at first from each of the four districts--to wit, the Second,\r\nFourth, Sixth, and Eighth--only, 2200 being the average quota of the other\r\nclass. After this drawing, these four districts, and also the Seventeenth\r\nand Twenty-ninth, shall be carefully re-enrolled; and, if you please,\r\nagents of yours may witness every step of the process. Any deficiency\r\nwhich may appear by the new enrolment will be supplied by a special draft\r\nfor that object, allowing due credit for volunteers who may be obtained\r\nfrom these districts respectively during the interval; and at all points,\r\nso far as consistent with practical convenience, due credits shall be\r\ngiven for volunteers, and your Excellency shall be notified of the time\r\nfixed for commencing the draft in each district.\r\n\r\nI do not object to abide a decision of the United States Supreme Court, or\r\nof the judges thereof, on the constitutionality of the draft law. In\r\nfact, I should be willing to facilitate the obtaining of it. But I cannot\r\nconsent to lose the time while it is being obtained. We are contending\r\nwith an enemy who, as I understand, drives every able-bodied man he can\r\nreach into his ranks, very much as a butcher drives bullocks into the\r\nslaughter-pen. No time is wasted, no argument is used. This produces an\r\narmy which will soon turn upon our now victorious soldiers already in the\r\nfield, if they shall not be sustained by recruits as they should be. It\r\nproduces an army with a rapidity not to be matched on our side if we first\r\nwaste time to re-experiment with the volunteer system, already deemed by\r\nCongress, and palpably, in fact, so far exhausted as to be inadequate;\r\nand then more time to obtain a court decision as to whether a law is\r\nconstitutional, which requires a part of those not now in the service\r\nto go to the aid of those who are already in it; and still more time to\r\ndetermine with absolute certainty that we get those who are to go in the\r\nprecisely legal proportion to those who are not to go. My purpose is to be\r\nin my action just and constitutional, and yet practical, in performing the\r\nimportant duty with which I am charged, of maintaining the unity and the\r\nfree principles of our common country.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL U.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION WASHINGTON, August 9, 1863.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GENERAL GRANT:\r\n\r\nI see by a despatch of yours that you incline quite strongly toward an\r\nexpedition against Mobile. This would appear tempting to me also, were it\r\nnot that in view of recent events in Mexico I am greatly impressed with\r\nthe importance of re-establishing the national authority in western Texas\r\nas soon as possible. I am not making an order, however; that I leave, for\r\nthe present at least, to the general-in-chief.\r\n\r\nA word upon another subject: General Thomas has gone again to the\r\nMississippi Valley, with the view of raising colored troops. I have no\r\nreason to doubt that you are doing what you reasonably can upon the same\r\nsubject. I believe it is a resource which if vigorously applied now\r\nwill soon close the contest. It works doubly, weakening the enemy and\r\nstrengthening us. We were not fully ripe for it until the river was\r\nopened. Now, I think at least one hundred thousand can and ought to be\r\nrapidly organized along its shores, relieving all white troops to serve\r\nelsewhere. Mr. Dana understands you as believing that the Emancipation\r\nProclamation has helped some in your military operations. I am very glad\r\nif this is so.\r\n\r\nDid you receive a short letter from me dated the 13th of July?\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL W. S. ROSECRANS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August 10, 1863.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GENERAL ROSECRANS:\r\n\r\nYours of the 1st was received two days ago. I think you must have inferred\r\nmore than General Halleck has intended, as to any dissatisfaction of mine\r\nwith you. I am sure you, as a reasonable man, would not have been wounded\r\ncould you have heard all my words and seen all my thoughts in regard to\r\nyou. I have not abated in my kind feeling for and confidence in you. I\r\nhave seen most of your despatches to General Halleck--probably all of\r\nthem. After Grant invested Vicksburg I was very anxious lest Johnston\r\nshould overwhelm him from the outside, and when it appeared certain that\r\npart of Bragg's force had gone and was going to Johnston, it did seem to\r\nme it was exactly the proper time for you to attack Bragg with what force\r\nhe had left. In all kindness let me say it so seems to me yet. Finding\r\nfrom your despatches to General Halleck that your judgment was different,\r\nand being very anxious for Grant, I, on one occasion, told General Halleck\r\nI thought he should direct you to decide at once to immediately attack\r\nBragg or to stand on the defensive and send part of your force to Grant.\r\nHe replied he had already so directed in substance. Soon after, despatches\r\nfrom Grant abated my anxiety for him, and in proportion abated my anxiety\r\nabout any movement of yours. When afterward, however, I saw a despatch of\r\nyours arguing that the right time for you to attack Bragg was not before,\r\nbut would be after, the fall of Vicksburg, it impressed me very strangely,\r\nand I think I so stated to the Secretary of War and General Halleck. It\r\nseemed no other than the proposition that you could better fight Bragg\r\nwhen Johnston should be at liberty to return and assist him than you could\r\nbefore he could so return to his assistance.\r\n\r\nSince Grant has been entirely relieved by the fall of Vicksburg, by which\r\nJohnston is also relieved, it has seemed to me that your chance for a\r\nstroke has been considerably diminished, and I have not been pressing you\r\ndirectly or indirectly. True, I am very anxious for East Tennessee to be\r\noccupied by us; but I see and appreciate the difficulties you mention. The\r\nquestion occurs, Can the thing be done at all? Does preparation advance at\r\nall? Do you not consume supplies as fast as you get them forward? Have you\r\nmore animals to-day than you had at the battle of Stone's River? And\r\nyet have not more been furnished you since then than your entire present\r\nstock? I ask the same questions as to your mounted force.\r\n\r\nDo not misunderstand: I am not casting blame upon you; I rather think\r\nby great exertion you can get to East Tennessee; but a very important\r\nquestion is, Can you stay there? I make no order in the case--that I leave\r\nto General Halleck and yourself.\r\n\r\nAnd now be assured once more that I think of you in all kindness and\r\nconfidence, and that I am not watching you with an evil eye.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR SEYMOUR.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION WASHINGTON, August 11.1863.\r\n\r\nHIS EXCELLENCY HORATIO SEYMOUR, Governor of New York:\r\n\r\nYours of the 8th, with Judge-Advocate-General Waterbury's report, was\r\nreceived to-day.\r\n\r\nAsking you to remember that I consider time as being very important, both\r\nto the general cause of the country and to the soldiers in the field, I\r\nbeg to remind you that I waited, at your request, from the 1st until the\r\n6th inst., to receive your communication dated the 3d. In view of\r\nits great length, and the known time and apparent care taken in its\r\npreparation, I did not doubt that it contained your full case as you\r\ndesired to present it. It contained the figures for twelve districts,\r\nomitting the other nineteen, as I suppose, because you found nothing to\r\ncomplain of as to them. I answered accordingly. In doing so I laid down\r\nthe principle to which I purpose adhering, which is to proceed with the\r\ndraft, at the same time employing infallible means to avoid any great\r\nwrong. With the communication received to-day you send figures for\r\ntwenty-eight districts, including the twelve sent before, and still\r\nomitting three, for which I suppose the enrolments are not yet received.\r\nIn looking over the fuller list of twenty-eight districts, I find that the\r\nquotas for sixteen of them are above 2000 and below 2700, while, of the\r\nrest, six are above 2700 and six are below 2000. Applying the principle to\r\nthese new facts, the Fifth and Seventh districts must be added to the four\r\nin which the quotas have already been reduced to 2200 for the first draft;\r\nand with these four others just be added to those to be re-enrolled. The\r\ncorrect case will then stand: the quotas of the Second, Fourth, Fifth,\r\nSixth, Seventh, and Eighth districts fixed at 2200 for the first draft.\r\nThe Provost-Marshal-General informs me that the drawing is already\r\ncompleted in the Sixteenth, Seventeenth, Eighteenth, Twenty-second,\r\nTwenty-fourth, Twenty-sixth, Twenty-seventh, Twenty-eighth, Twenty-ninth,\r\nand Thirtieth districts. In the others, except the three outstanding, the\r\ndrawing will be made upon the quotas as now fixed. After the first draft,\r\nthe Second, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Sixteenth, Seventeenth,\r\nTwenty-first, Twenty-fifth, Twenty-ninth, and Thirty-first will be\r\nenrolled for the purpose and in the manner stated in my letter of the 7th\r\ninst. The same principle will be applied to the now outstanding districts\r\nwhen they shall come in. No part of my former letter is repudiated by\r\nreason of not being restated in this, or for any other cause.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL J. A. McCLERNAND.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August 12, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL McCLERNAND.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Our friend William G. Greene has just presented a kind\r\nletter in regard to yourself, addressed to me by our other friends Yates,\r\nHatch, and Dubois.\r\n\r\nI doubt whether your present position is more painful to you than to\r\nmyself. Grateful for the patriotic stand so early taken by you in this\r\nlife-and-death struggle of the nation, I have done whatever has appeared\r\npracticable to advance you and the public interest together. No charges,\r\nwith a view to a trial, have been preferred against you by any one; nor do\r\nI suppose any will be. All there is, so far as I have heard, is General\r\nGrant's statement of his reasons for relieving you. And even this I have\r\nnot seen or sought to see; because it is a case, as appears to me, in\r\nwhich I could do nothing without doing harm. General Grant and yourself\r\nhave been conspicuous in our most important successes; and for me to\r\ninterfere and thus magnify a breach between you could not but be of evil\r\neffect. Better leave it where the law of the case has placed it. For me to\r\nforce you back upon General Grant would be forcing him to resign. I cannot\r\ngive you a new command, because we have no forces except such as already\r\nhave commanders.\r\n\r\nI am constantly pressed by those who scold before they think, or without\r\nthinking at all, to give commands respectively to Fremont, McClellan,\r\nButler, Sigel, Curtis, Hunter, Hooker, and perhaps others, when, all else\r\nout of the way, I have no commands to give them. This is now your case;\r\nwhich, as I have said, pains me not less than it does you. My belief is\r\nthat the permanent estimate of what a general does in the field is fixed\r\nby the \"cloud of witnesses\" who have been with him in the field, and that,\r\nrelying on these, he who has the right needs not to fear.\r\n\r\nYour friend as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR SEYMOUR.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, AUGUST 16, 1863.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR SEYMOUR, New York:\r\n\r\nYour despatch of this morning is just received, and I fear I do not\r\nperfectly understand it.\r\n\r\nMy view of the principle is that every soldier obtained voluntarily leaves\r\none less to be obtained by draft. The only difficulty is in applying the\r\nprinciple properly. Looking to time, as heretofore, I am unwilling to\r\ngive up a drafted man now, even for the certainty, much less for the mere\r\nchance, of getting a volunteer hereafter. Again, after the draft in any\r\ndistrict, would it not make trouble to take any drafted man out and put a\r\nvolunteer in--for how shall it be determined which drafted man is to have\r\nthe privilege of thus going out, to the exclusion of all the others? And\r\neven before the draft in any district the quota must be fixed; and the\r\ndraft must be postponed indefinitely if every time a volunteer is offered\r\nthe officers must stop and reconstruct the quota. At least I fear there\r\nmight be this difficulty; but, at all events, let credits for volunteers\r\nbe given up to the last moment which will not produce confusion or delay.\r\nThat the principle of giving credits for volunteers shall be applied by\r\ndistricts seems fair and proper, though I do not know how far by present\r\nstatistics it is practicable. When for any cause a fair credit is not\r\ngiven at one time, it should be given as soon thereafter as practicable.\r\nMy purpose is to be just and fair, and yet to not lose time.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo J. H. HACKETT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON August 17, 1863.\r\n\r\nJAMES H. HACKETT, Esq.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Months ago I should have acknowledged the receipt of your\r\nbook and accompanying kind note; and I now have to beg your pardon for not\r\nhaving done so.\r\n\r\nFor one of my age I have seen very little of the drama. The first\r\npresentation of Falstaff I ever saw was yours here, last winter or spring.\r\nPerhaps the best compliment I can pay is to say, as I truly can, I am very\r\nanxious to see it again. Some of Shakespeare's plays I have never read,\r\nwhile others I have gone over perhaps as frequently as any un-professional\r\nreader. Among the latter are Lear, Richard III., Henry VIII., Hamlet, and\r\nespecially Macbeth. I think nothing equals Macbeth. It is wonderful.\r\n\r\nUnlike you gentlemen of the profession, I think the soliloquy in Hamlet\r\ncommencing \"Oh, my offense is rank,\" surpasses that commencing \"To be or\r\nnot to be.\" But pardon this small attempt at criticism. I should like to\r\nhear you pronounce the opening speech of Richard III. Will you not soon\r\nvisit Washington again? If you do, please call and let me make your\r\npersonal acquaintance.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO F. F. LOWE.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., August 17, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. P. F. LOWE, San Francisco, Cal.:\r\n\r\nThere seems to be considerable misunderstanding about the recent movement\r\nto take possession of the \"New Almaden\" mine. It has no reference to any\r\nother mine or mines.\r\n\r\nIn regard to mines and miners generally, no change of policy by the\r\nGovernment has been decided on, or even thought of, so far as I know.\r\n\r\nThe \"New Almaden\" mine was peculiar in this: that its occupants claimed to\r\nbe the legal owners of it on a Mexican grant, and went into court on that\r\nclaim. The case found its way into the Supreme Court of the United States,\r\nand last term, in and by that court, the claim of the occupants was\r\ndecided to be utterly fraudulent. Thereupon it was considered the duty of\r\nthe Government by the Secretary of the Interior, the Attorney-General,\r\nand myself to take possession of the premises; and the Attorney-General\r\ncarefully made out the writ and I signed it. It was not obtained\r\nsurreptitiously, although I suppose General Halleck thought it had been,\r\nwhen he telegraphed, simply because he thought possession was about being\r\ntaken by a military order, while he knew no such order had passed through\r\nhis hands as general-in-chief.\r\n\r\nThe writ was suspended, upon urgent representations from California,\r\nsimply to keep the peace. It never had any direct or indirect reference to\r\nany mine, place, or person, except the \"New Almaden\" mine and the persons\r\nconnected with it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL MEADE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August 21, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Warrenton, Va.:\r\n\r\nAt this late moment I am appealed to in behalf of William Thompson of\r\nCompany K, Third Maryland Volunteers, in Twelfth Army Corps, said to be\r\nat Kelly's Ford, under sentence to be shot to-day as a deserter. He is\r\nrepresented to me to be very young, with symptoms of insanity. Please\r\npostpone the execution till further order.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL SCHOFIELD.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., August 22, 1863.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SCHOFIELD, Saint Louis, Mo.:\r\n\r\nPlease send me if you can a transcript of the record in the case of McQuin\r\nand Bell, convicted of murder by a military commission. I telegraphed\r\nGeneral Strong for it, but he does not answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO MRS. GRIMSLEY.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., August 24, 1863.\r\n\r\nMRS. ELIZABETH J. GRIMSLEY, Springfield, Ill.:\r\n\r\nI mail the papers to you to-day appointing Johnny to the Naval school.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CRITICS OF EMANCIPATION\r\n\r\nTo J. C. CONKLING.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August 26, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. JAMES C. CONKLING.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Your letter inviting me to attend a mass meeting of\r\nunconditional Union men, to be held at the capital of Illinois, on the\r\n3d day of September, has been received. It would be very agreeable for\r\nme thus to meet my old friends at my own home, but I cannot just now be\r\nabsent from here so long as a visit there would require.\r\n\r\nThe meeting is to be of all those who maintain unconditional devotion to\r\nthe Union, and I am sure that my old political friends will thank me for\r\ntendering, as I do, the nation's gratitude to those other noble men whom\r\nno partisan malice or partisan hope can make false to the nation's life.\r\n\r\nThere are those who are dissatisfied with me. To such I would say: You\r\ndesire peace, and you blame me that we do not have it. But how can we\r\nobtain it? There are but three conceivable ways:\r\n\r\nFirst--to suppress the rebellion by force of arms. This I am trying to do.\r\nAre you for it? If you are, so far we are agreed. If you are not for it, a\r\nsecond way is to give up the Union. I am against this. Are you for it? If\r\nyou are you should say so plainly. If you are not for force nor yet for\r\ndissolution, there only remains some imaginable compromise.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that any compromise embracing the maintenance of the\r\nUnion is now possible. All that I learn leads to a directly opposite\r\nbelief. The strength of the rebellion is its military, its army. That army\r\ndominates all the country and all the people within its range. Any offer\r\nof terms made by any man or men within that range, in opposition to that\r\narmy, is simply nothing for the present; because such man or men have no\r\npower whatever to enforce their side of a compromise, if one were made\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate: Suppose refugees from the South and peace men of the North\r\nget together in convention, and frame and proclaim a compromise embracing\r\na restoration of the Union. In what way can that compromise be used to\r\nkeep Lee's army out of Pennsylvania? Meade's army can keep Lee's army out\r\nof Pennsylvania, and, I think, can ultimately drive it out of existence.\r\nBut no paper compromise to which the controllers of Lee's army are not\r\nagreed can at all affect that army. In an effort at such compromise we\r\nwould waste time, which the enemy would improve to our disadvantage; and\r\nthat would be all.\r\n\r\nA compromise, to be effective, must be made either with those who control\r\nthe rebel army, or with the people, first liberated from the domination of\r\nthat army by the success of our own army. Now allow me to assure you\r\nthat no word or intimation from that rebel army, or from any of the men\r\ncontrolling it, in relation to any peace compromise, has ever come to\r\nmy knowledge or belief. All charges and insinuations to the contrary are\r\ndeceptive and groundless. And I promise you that if any such proposition\r\nshall hereafter come, it shall not be rejected and kept a secret from you.\r\nI freely acknowledge myself to be the servant of the people, according to\r\nthe bond of service, the United States Constitution, and that, as such, I\r\nam responsible to them.\r\n\r\nBut, to be plain: You are dissatisfied with me about the negro. Quite\r\nlikely there is a difference of opinion between you and myself upon\r\nthat subject. I certainly wish that all men could be free, while you,\r\nI suppose, do not. Yet, I have neither adopted nor proposed any measure\r\nwhich is not consistent with even your view, provided you are for the\r\nUnion. I suggested compensated emancipation; to which you replied you\r\nwished not to be taxed to buy negroes. But I had not asked you to be taxed\r\nto buy negroes, except in such way as to save you from greater taxation to\r\nsave the Union exclusively by other means.\r\n\r\nYou dislike the Emancipation Proclamation, and perhaps would have it\r\nretracted. You say it is unconstitutional. I think differently. I think\r\nthe Constitution invests its commander-in-chief with the law of war in\r\ntime of war. The most that can be said, if so much, is, that slaves are\r\nproperty. Is there, has there ever been, any question that by the law of\r\nwar, property, both of enemies and friends, may be taken when needed? And\r\nis it not needed whenever it helps us and hurts the enemy? Armies, the\r\nworld over, destroy enemies' property when they cannot use it, and even\r\ndestroy their own to keep it from the enemy. Civilized belligerents do all\r\nin their power to help themselves or hurt the enemy, except a few things\r\nregarded as barbarous or cruel. Among the exceptions are the massacre of\r\nvanquished foes and non-combatants, male and female.\r\n\r\nBut the proclamation, as law, either is valid or is not valid. If it is\r\nnot valid it needs no retraction. If it is valid it cannot be retracted,\r\nany more than the dead can be brought to life. Some of you profess to\r\nthink its retraction would operate favorably for the Union, why better\r\nafter the retraction than before the issue? There was more than a year\r\nand a half of trial to suppress the rebellion before the proclamation was\r\nissued, the last one hundred days of which passed under an explicit notice\r\nthat it was coming, unless averted by those in revolt returning to their\r\nallegiance. The war has certainly progressed as favorably for us since the\r\nissue of the proclamation as before.\r\n\r\nI know, as fully as one can know the opinions of others, that some of\r\nthe commanders of our armies in the field, who have given us our most\r\nimportant victories, believe the emancipation policy and the use of\r\ncolored troops constitute the heaviest blows yet dealt to the rebellion,\r\nand that at least one of those important successes could not have been\r\nachieved when it was but for the aid of black soldiers.\r\n\r\nAmong the commanders who hold these views are some who have never had any\r\naffinity with what is called \"Abolitionism,\" or with \"Republican Party\r\npolitics,\" but who hold them purely as military opinions. I submit their\r\nopinions are entitled to some weight against the objections often urged\r\nthat emancipation and arming the blacks are unwise as military measures,\r\nand were not adopted as such in good faith.\r\n\r\nYou say that you will not fight to free negroes. Some of them seem willing\r\nto fight for you; but no matter. Fight you, then, exclusively, to save\r\nthe Union. I issued the proclamation on purpose to aid you in saving the\r\nUnion. Whenever you shall have conquered all resistance to the Union, if\r\nI shall urge you to continue fighting, it will be an apt time then for\r\nyou to declare you will not fight to free negroes. I thought that in\r\nyour struggle for the Union, to whatever extent the negroes should cease\r\nhelping the enemy, to that extent it weakened the enemy in his resistance\r\nto you. Do you think differently? I thought that whatever negroes can be\r\ngot to do as soldiers, leaves just so much less for white soldiers to do\r\nin saving the Union. Does it appear otherwise to you? But negroes, like\r\nother people, act upon motives. Why should they do anything for us if we\r\nwill do nothing for them? If they stake their lives for us they must be\r\nprompted by the strongest motive, even the promise of freedom. And the\r\npromise, being made, must be kept.\r\n\r\nThe signs look better. The Father of Waters again goes unvexed to the\r\nsea. Thanks to the great Northwest for it; nor yet wholly to them. Three\r\nhundred miles up they met New England, Empire, Keystone, and Jersey,\r\nhewing their way right and left. The sunny South, too, in more colors than\r\none, also lent a helping hand. On the spot, their part of the history was\r\njotted down in black and white. The job was a great national one, and let\r\nnone be slighted who bore an honorable part in it And while those who have\r\ncleared the great river may well be proud, even that is not all. It is\r\nhard to say that anything has been more bravely and well done than at\r\nAntietam, Murfreesboro, Gettysburg, and on many fields of less note. Nor\r\nmust Uncle Sam's web-feet be forgotten. At all the watery margins they\r\nhave been present; not only on the deep sea, the broad bay, and the rapid\r\nriver, but also up the narrow, muddy bayou, and wherever the ground was a\r\nlittle damp, they have been and made their tracks. Thanks to all. For the\r\ngreat Republic--for the principle it lives by and keeps alive--for man's\r\nvast future--thanks to all.\r\n\r\nPeace does not appear so distant as it did. I hope it will come soon, and\r\ncome to stay, and so come as to be worth the keeping in all future\r\ntime. It will then have been proved that among freemen there can be no\r\nsuccessful appeal from the ballot to the bullet, and that they who take\r\nsuch appeal are sure to lose their case and pay the cost. And there will\r\nbe some black men who can remember that with silent tongue, and clinched\r\nteeth, and steady eye, and well-poised bayonet, they have helped mankind\r\non to this great consummation; while I fear there will be some white ones\r\nunable to forget that with malignant heart and deceitful speech they have\r\nstriven to hinder it.\r\n\r\nStill, let us not be over-sanguine of a speedy, final triumph. Let us be\r\nquite sober. Let us diligently apply the means, never doubting that a just\r\nGod, in His own good time, will give us the rightful result.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES CONKLING.\r\n\r\n(Private.)\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, D. C., August 27.1863.\r\n\r\nHON. JAMES CONKLING.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR CONKLING:--I cannot leave here now. Herewith is a letter instead.\r\nYou are one of the best public readers. I have but one suggestion--read it\r\nvery slowly. And now God bless you, and all good Union men.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., August 26, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR SIR:-In my correspondence with Governor Seymour in\r\nrelation to the draft, I have said to him, substantially, that credits\r\nshall be given for volunteers up to the latest moment, before drawing in\r\nany district, that can be done without producing confusion or delay. In\r\norder to do this, let our mustering officers in New York and elsewhere be\r\nat, once instructed that whenever they muster into our service any number\r\nof volunteers, to at once make return to the War Department, both by\r\ntelegraph and mail, the date of the muster, the number mustered, and the\r\nCongressional or enrolment district or districts, of their residences,\r\ngiving the numbers separately for each district. Keep these returns\r\ndiligently posted, and by them give full credit on the quotas, if\r\npossible, on the last day before the draft begins in any district.\r\n\r\nAgain, I have informed Governor Seymour that he shall be notified of the\r\ntime when the draft is to commence in each district in his State. This\r\nis equally proper for all the States. In order to carry it out, I propose\r\nthat so soon as the day for commencing the draft in any district is\r\ndefinitely determined, the governor of the State, including the district,\r\nbe notified thereof, both by telegraph and mail, in form about as follows:\r\n\r\n     ------------------------------\r\n\r\n     ------------------------ 1863.\r\n\r\nGovernor of ------------------------------\r\n     ------------------------------------\r\n\r\nYou are notified that the draft will commence in the\r\n------------------ ---- district, at ------ on the\r\n ------ day ------------\r\n1863, at ------ A.M. of said day.\r\n\r\nPlease acknowledge receipt of this by telegraph and mail.\r\n               ------------------------\r\n               ------------------------\r\n\r\nThis notice may be given by the Provost-Marshal-General here, the\r\nsub-provost-marshal-generals in the States, or perhaps by the district\r\nprovost-marshals.\r\n\r\nWhenever we shall have so far proceeded in New York as to make the\r\nre-enrolment specially promised there practicable, I wish that also to go\r\nforward, and I wish Governor Seymour notified of it; so that if he choose,\r\nhe can place agents of his with ours to see the work fairly done.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR SEYMOUR.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., August 27. 1863.\r\n\r\nHIS EXCELLENCY HORATIO SEYMOUR,\r\n\r\nGovernor of New York:\r\n\r\nYours of the 21st, with exhibits, was received on the 24th.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of pressing duties I have been unable to answer it sooner. In\r\nthe meantime the Provost Marshal-General has had access to yours, and has\r\naddressed a communication in relation to it to the Secretary of War, a\r\ncopy of which communication I herewith enclose to you.\r\n\r\nIndependently of this, I addressed a letter on the same subject to the\r\nSecretary of War, a copy of which I also enclose to you. The Secretary\r\nhas sent my letter to the Provost-Marshal General, with direction that\r\nhe adopt and follow the course therein pointed out. It will, of course,\r\noverrule any conflicting view of the Provost-Marshal-General, if there be\r\nsuch.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nP. S.-I do not mean to say that if the Provost-Marshal-General can find\r\nit practicable to give credits by subdistricts, I overrule him in that.\r\nOn the contrary, I shall be glad of it; but I will not take the risk of\r\nover-burdening him by ordering him to do it. A. L.\r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. M. SCHOFIELD.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., August 27, 1863 8.30 P. M.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SCHOFIELD, St. LOUIS:\r\n\r\nI have just received the despatch which follows, from two very influential\r\ncitizens of Kansas, whose names I omit. The severe blow they have received\r\nnaturally enough makes them intemperate even without there being any just\r\ncause for blame. Please do your utmost to give them future security and to\r\npunish their invaders.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL G. G. MEADE.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., August 27, 1863 9 A.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Warrenton, Va.:\r\n\r\nWalter, Rionese, Folancy, Lai, and Kuhn appealed to me for mercy, without\r\ngiving any ground for it whatever. I understand these are very flagrant\r\ncases, and that you deem their punishment as being indispensable to the\r\nservice. If I am not mistaken in this, please let them know at once that\r\ntheir appeal is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO F. C. SHERMAN AND J. S. HAYES.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, August 27, 1863.\r\n\r\nF. C. SHERMAN, Mayor, J. S. HAVES, Comptroller, Chicago, Ill.:\r\n\r\nYours of the 24th, in relation to the draft, is received. It seems to me\r\nthe Government here will be overwhelmed if it undertakes to conduct\r\nthese matters with the authorities of cities and counties. They must be\r\nconducted with the governors of States, who will, of course, represent\r\ntheir cities and counties. Meanwhile you need not be uneasy until you\r\nagain hear from here.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL FOSTER.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, August 28, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL FOSTER, Fort Monroe, Va.:\r\n\r\nPlease notify, if you can, Senator Bowden, Mr. Segar, and Mr. Chandler,\r\nall or any of them, that I now have the record in Dr. Wright's case, and\r\nam ready to hear them. When you shall have got the notice to them, please\r\nlet me know.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL CRAWFORD.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., August 28, 1863.\r\n\r\nGENERAL CRAWFORD, Rappahannock Station, Va.:\r\n\r\nI regret that I cannot be present to witness the presentation of a sword\r\nby the gallant Pennsylvania Reserve Corps to one so worthy to receive it\r\nas General Meade.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO L. SWETT.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., August 29, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. L. SWETT, San Francisco, Cal.: If the Government's rights are\r\nreserved, the Government will be satisfied, and at all events it will\r\nconsider.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO MRS. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C. August 29, 1863.\r\n\r\nMRS. A. LINCOLN, Manchester, N. H.:\r\n\r\nAll quite well. Fort Sumter is certainly battered down and utterly useless\r\nto the enemy, and it is believed here, but not entirely certain, that both\r\nSumter and Fort Wagner are occupied by our forces. It is also certain that\r\nGeneral Gilmore has thrown some shot into the city of Charleston.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO J. C. CONKLING.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,\r\n\r\nAugust 31, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. JAMES C. CONKLING, Springfield, Ill.:\r\n\r\nIn my letter of the 26th insert between the sentence ending \"since the\r\nissue of the Emancipation Proclamation as before\" and the next, commencing\r\n\"You say you will not fight, etc.,\" what follows below my signature\r\nhereto.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\"I know as fully as one can know the opinions of others that some of\r\nthe commanders of our armies in the field, who have given us our most\r\nimportant successes, believe the emancipation policy and the use of\r\ncolored troops constitute the heaviest blow yet dealt to the rebellion,\r\nand that at least one of those important successes could not have been\r\nachieved when it was, but for the aid of black soldiers. Among the\r\ncommanders holding these views are some who have never had any affinity\r\nwith what is called abolitionism, or with Republican party politics, but\r\nwho hold them purely as military opinions. I submit these opinions as\r\nbeing entitled to some weight against the objections, often urged, that\r\nemancipation and arming the blacks are unwise as military measures and\r\nwere not adopted as such in good faith.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL W. S. ROSECRANS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, August 31, 1863.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GENERAL ROSECRANS:\r\n\r\nYours of the 22d was received yesterday. When I wrote you before, I did\r\nnot intend, nor do I now, to engage in an argument with you on military\r\nquestions. You had informed me you were impressed through General Halleck\r\nthat I was dissatisfied with you, and I could not bluntly deny that I was\r\nwithout unjustly implicating him. I therefore concluded to tell you the\r\nplain truth, being satisfied the matter would thus appear much smaller\r\nthan it would if seen by mere glimpses. I repeat that my appreciation of\r\nyou has not abated. I can never forget whilst I remember anything, that\r\nabout the end of last year and the beginning of this, you gave us a\r\nhard-earned victory, which, had there been a defeat instead, the nation\r\ncould hardly have lived over. Neither can I forget the check you so\r\nopportunely gave to a dangerous sentiment which was spreading in the\r\nNorth.\r\n\r\nYours, as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nAugust 31, 1863\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable that retaliation for the recent great outrage\r\nat Lawrence, in Kansas, may extend to indiscriminate slaughter on the\r\nMissouri border, unless averted by very judicious action. I shall be\r\nobliged if the general-in-chief can make any suggestions to General\r\nSchofield upon the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL MOTIVATED MISQUOTATION IN NEWSPAPER\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO J. C. CONKLING.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, September 3, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. JAMES C. CONKLING, Springfield, Ill.:\r\n\r\nI am mortified this morning to find the letter to you botched up in the\r\nEastern papers, telegraphed from Chicago. How did this happen?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER CONCERNING COMMERCIAL REGULATIONS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, September 4, 1863.\r\n\r\nOrdered, That the executive order dated November 21, 1862, prohibiting the\r\nexportation from the United States of arms, ammunition, or munitions of\r\nwar, under which the commandants of departments were, by order of the\r\nSecretary of War dated May 13, 1863, directed to prohibit the purchase\r\nand sale, for exportation from the United States, of all horses and mules\r\nwithin their respective commands, and to take and appropriate for the\r\nuse of the United States any horses, mules, and live stock designed for\r\nexportation, be so far modified that any arms heretofore imported into the\r\nUnited States may be re-exported to the place of original shipment,\r\nand that any live stock raised in any State or Territory bounded by the\r\nPacific Ocean may be exported from, any port of such State or Territory.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO J. SEGAR.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C.. September 5, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. JOSEPH SEGAR, Fort Monroe, Va.:\r\n\r\nI have just seen your despatch to the Secretary of War, who is absent.\r\nI also send a despatch from Major Hayner of the 3d showing that he had\r\nnotice of my order, and stating that the people were jubilant over it, as\r\na victory over the Government extorted by fear, and that he had already\r\ncollected about $4000 of the money. If he has proceeded since, I shall\r\nhold him accountable for his contumacy. On the contrary, no dollar shall\r\nbe refunded by my order until it shall appear that my act in the case has\r\nbeen accepted in the right spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO MRS. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON. D. C. September 6, 1863.\r\n\r\nMRS. A. LINCOLN, Manchester, Vt.:\r\n\r\nAll well and no news except that General Burnside has Knoxville, Ten.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO SECRETARY STANTON.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, September 6, 1863. 6 P.M.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF WAR, Bedford, Pa.:\r\n\r\nBurnside has Kingston and Knoxville, and drove the enemy across the river\r\nat Loudon, the enemy destroying the bridge there; captured some stores and\r\none or two trains; very little fighting; few wounded and none killed. No\r\nother news of consequence.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO F. C. SHERMAN AND J. S. HAYES.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, September 7, 1863.\r\n\r\nYours of August 29 just received. I suppose it was intended by Congress\r\nthat this government should execute the act in question without dependence\r\nupon any other government, State, city, or county. It is, however, within\r\nthe range of practical convenience to confer with the governments of\r\nStates, while it is quite beyond that range to have correspondence on the\r\nsubject with counties and cities. They are too numerous. As instances, I\r\nhave corresponded with Governor Seymour, but Not with Mayor Opdyke; with\r\nGovernor Curtin, but not with Mayor Henry.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GOVERNOR JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, September 8, 1863. 9.30\r\n\r\nHON. ANDREW JOHNSON, Nashville, Tenn.:\r\n\r\nDespatch of yesterday just received. I shall try to find the paper you\r\nmention and carefully consider it. In the meantime let me urge that you do\r\nyour utmost to get every man you can, black and white, under arms at the\r\nvery earliest moment, to guard roads, bridges, and trains, allowing all\r\nthe better trained soldiers to go forward to Rosecrans. Of course I mean\r\nfor you to act in co-operation with and not independently of, the military\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL MEADE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, September 9, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Warrenton, Va.:\r\n\r\nIt would be a generous thing to give General Wheaton a leave of absence\r\nfor ten or fifteen days, and if you can do so without injury to the\r\nservice, please do it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL WHEATON.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., September 10, 1863.\r\n\r\nGENERAL WHEATON, Army of Potomac:\r\n\r\nYesterday at the instance of Mr. Blair, senator, I telegraphed General\r\nMeade asking him to grant you a leave of absence, to which he replied that\r\nyou had not applied for such leave, and that you can have it when you do\r\napply. I suppose it is proper for you to know this.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, SEPTEMBER, 11, 1863\r\n\r\nHON. ANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--All Tennessee is now clear of armed insurrectionists. You\r\nneed not to be reminded that it is the nick of time for reinaugurating\r\na loyal State government. Not a moment should be lost. You and the\r\nco-operating friends there can better judge of the ways and means than can\r\nbe judged by any here. I only offer a few suggestions. The reinauguration\r\nmust not be such as to give control of the State and its representation\r\nin Congress to the enemies of the Union, driving its friends there\r\ninto political exile. The whole struggle for Tennessee will have been\r\nprofitless to both State and nation if it so ends that Governor Johnson is\r\nput down and Governor Harris put up. It must not be so. You must have it\r\notherwise. Let the reconstruction be the work of such men only as can be\r\ntrusted for the Union. Exclude all others, and trust that your government\r\nso organized will be recognized here as being the one of republican form\r\nto be guaranteed to the State, and to be protected against invasion and\r\ndomestic violence. It is something on the question of time to remember\r\nthat it cannot be known who is next to occupy the position I now hold, nor\r\nwhat he will do. I see that you have declared in favor of emancipation\r\nin Tennessee, for which may God bless you. Get emancipation into your new\r\nState government constitution and there will be no such word as fail for\r\nyour cause. The raising of colored troops, I think, will greatly help\r\nevery way.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL A. E. BURNSIDE.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, September 11, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL BURNSIDE, Cumberland Gap:\r\n\r\nYours received. A thousand thanks for the late successes you have given\r\nus. We cannot allow you to resign until things shall be a little more\r\nsettled in East Tennessee. If then, purely on your own account, you wish\r\nto resign, we will not further refuse you.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL MEADE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, September 11, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Warrenton, Va.:\r\n\r\nIt is represented to me that Thomas Edds, in your army, is under sentence\r\nof death for desertion, to be executed next Monday. It is also said his\r\nsupposed desertion is comprised in an absence commencing with his falling\r\nbehind last winter, being captured and paroled by the enemy, and then\r\ngoing home. If this be near the truth, please suspend the execution till\r\nfurther order and send in the record of the trial.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL MEADE.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., September 12, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL MEAD, Warrenton, Va.:\r\n\r\nThe name is \"Thomas Edds\" not \"Eddies\" as in your despatch. The papers\r\nleft with me do not designate the regiment to which he belongs. The man\r\nwho gave me the papers, I do not know how to find again. He only told me\r\nthat Edds is in the Army of the Potomac, and that he fell out of the ranks\r\nduring Burnside's mud march last winter. If I get further information I\r\nwill telegraph again.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO H. H. SCOTT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, September 13, 1863.\r\n\r\nDr. WILLIAM H. H. SCOTT, Danville, Ill.:\r\n\r\nYour niece, Mrs. Kate Sharp, can now have no difficulty in going to\r\nKnoxville, Tenn., as that place is within our military lines.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO J. G. BLAINE.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., September 25, 1863.\r\n\r\nJ. G. BLAINE, Augusta, Me.: Thanks both for the good news you send and for\r\nthe sending of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION SUSPENDING WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS, SEPTEMBER 15, 1863.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nWhereas the Constitution of the United States has ordained that the\r\nprivilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when,\r\nin cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it; and:\r\n\r\nWhereas a rebellion was existing on the third day of March, 1863, which\r\nrebellion is still existing; and:\r\n\r\nWhereas by a statute which was approved on that day it was enacted by\r\nthe Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in Congress\r\nassembled that during the present insurrection the President of the\r\nUnited States, whenever in his judgment the public safety may require, is\r\nauthorized to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in any\r\ncase throughout the United States or any part thereof; and:\r\n\r\nWhereas, in the judgment of the President, the public safety does require\r\nthat the privilege of the said writ shall new be suspended throughout the\r\nUnited States in the cases where, by the authority of the President of the\r\nUnited States, military, naval, and civil officers of the United States,\r\nor any of them, hold persons under their command or in their custody,\r\neither as prisoners of war, spies, or aiders or abettors of the enemy, or\r\nofficers, soldiers, or seamen enrolled or drafted or mustered or enlisted\r\nin or belonging to the land or naval forces of the United States, or as\r\ndeserters therefrom, or otherwise amenable to military law or the rules\r\nand articles of war or the rules or regulations prescribed for the\r\nmilitary or naval services by authority of the President of the United\r\nStates, or for resisting a draft, or for any other offense against the\r\nmilitary or naval service.\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States,\r\ndo hereby proclaim and make known to all whom it may concern that the\r\nprivilege of the writ of habeas corpus is suspended throughout the United\r\nStates in the several cases before mentioned, and that this suspension\r\nwill continue throughout the duration of the said rebellion or until this\r\nproclamation shall, by a subsequent one to be issued by the President of\r\nthe United States, be modified or revoked. And I do hereby require all\r\nmagistrates, attorneys, and other civil officers within the United States\r\nand all officers and others in the military and naval services of the\r\nUnited States to take distinct notice of this suspension and to give it\r\nfull effect, and all citizens of the United States to conduct and govern\r\nthemselves accordingly and in conformity with the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States and the laws of Congress in such case made and provided.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed, this fifteenth day of September,\r\nA.D. 1863, and of the independence of the United States of America the\r\neighty-eighth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:  WILLIAM H. SEWARD,\r\n  Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, September 13, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK:\r\n\r\nIf I did not misunderstand General Meade's last despatch, he posts you\r\non facts as well as he can, and desires your views and those of the\r\nGovernment as to what he shall do. My opinion is that he should move upon\r\nLee at once in manner of general attack, leaving to developments whether\r\nhe will make it a real attack. I think this would develop Lee's real\r\ncondition and purposes better than the cavalry alone can do.

ANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Herewith I send you a paper, substantially the same as the\r\none drawn up by yourself and mentioned in your despatch, but slightly\r\nchanged in two particulars: First, yours was so drawn as that I authorized\r\nyou to carry into effect the fourth section, etc., whereas I so modify\r\nit as to authorize you to so act as to require the United States to carry\r\ninto effect that section.\r\n\r\nSecondly, you had a clause committing me in some sort to the State\r\nconstitution of Tennessee, which I feared might embarrass you in making a\r\nnew constitution, if you desire; so I dropped that clause.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n[Inclosure.]\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C.,\r\n\r\nSeptember 19, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. ANDREW JOHNSON, Military Governor of Tennessee:\r\n\r\nIn addition to the matters contained in the orders and instructions given\r\nyou by the Secretary of War, you are hereby authorized to exercise such\r\npowers as may be necessary and proper to enable the loyal people of\r\nTennessee to present such a republican form of State government as will\r\nentitle the State to the guaranty of the United States therefor, and to\r\nbe protected under such State government by the United States against\r\ninvasion and domestic violence, all according to the fourth Section of the\r\nfourth article of the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMILITARY STRATEGY\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON D.C. September 19, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK:\r\n\r\nBy General Meade's despatch to you of yesterday it appears that he desires\r\nyour views and those of the government as to whether he shall advance upon\r\nthe enemy. I am not prepared to order, or even advise, an advance in this\r\ncase, wherein I know so little of particulars, and wherein he, in the\r\nfield, thinks the risk is so great and the promise of advantage so small.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the case presents matter for very serious consideration in\r\nanother aspect. These two armies confront each other across a small river,\r\nsubstantially midway between the two capitals, each defending its own\r\ncapital, and menacing the other. General Meade estimates the enemy's\r\ninfantry in front of him at not less than 40,000. Suppose we add fifty per\r\ncent. to this for cavalry, artillery, and extra-duty men stretching as far\r\nas Richmond, making the whole force of the enemy 60,000.\r\n\r\nGeneral Meade, as shown by the returns, has with him, and between him and\r\nWashington, of the same classes, of well men, over 90,000. Neither can\r\nbring the whole of his men into a battle; but each can bring as large a\r\npercentage in as the other. For a battle, then, General Meade has three\r\nmen to General Lee's two. Yet, it having been determined that choosing\r\nground and standing on the defensive gives so great advantage that the\r\nthree cannot safely attack the two, the three are left simply standing on\r\nthe defensive also.\r\n\r\nIf the enemy's 60,000 are sufficient to keep our 90,000 away from\r\nRichmond, why, by the same rule, may not 40,000 of ours keep their 60,000\r\naway from Washington, leaving us 50,000 to put to some other use? Having\r\npractically come to the mere defensive, it seems to be no economy at all\r\nto employ twice as many men for that object as are needed. With no object,\r\ncertainly, to mislead myself, I can perceive no fault in this statement,\r\nunless we admit we are not the equal of the enemy, man for man. I hope you\r\nwill consider it.\r\n\r\nTo avoid misunderstanding, let me say that to attempt to fight the enemy\r\nslowly back into his entrenchments at Richmond, and then to capture him,\r\nis an idea I have been trying to repudiate for quite a year.\r\n\r\nMy judgment is so clear against it that I would scarcely allow the attempt\r\nto be made if the general in command should desire to make it. My last\r\nattempt upon Richmond was to get McClellan, when he was nearer there\r\nthan the enemy was, to run in ahead of him. Since then I have constantly\r\ndesired the Army of the Potomac to make Lee's army, and not Richmond, its\r\nobjective point. If our army cannot fall upon the enemy and hurt him where\r\nhe is, it is plain to me it can gain nothing by attempting to follow him\r\nover a succession of intrenched lines into a fortified city.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO MRS. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C., September 20, 1863.\r\n\r\nMRS. A. LINCOLN, New York:\r\n\r\nI neither see nor hear anything of sickness here now, though there may\r\nbe much without my knowing it. I wish you to stay or come just as is most\r\nagreeable to yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO MRS. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C, September 21, 1863.\r\n\r\nMRS. A. LINCOLN. Fifth Avenue Hotel. New York:\r\n\r\nThe air is so clear and cool and apparently healthy that I would be glad\r\nfor you to come. Nothing very particular, but I would be glad to see you\r\nand Tad.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION WASHINGTON, D. C., September 21, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK:\r\n\r\nI think it very important for General Rosecrans to hold his position at\r\nor about Chattanooga, because if held from that place to Cleveland, both\r\ninclusive, it keeps all Tennessee clear of the enemy, and also breaks one\r\nof his most important railroad lines. To prevent these consequences is so\r\nvital to his cause that he cannot give up the effort to dislodge us from\r\nthe position, thus bringing him to us and saving us the labor, expense,\r\nand hazard of going farther to find him, and also giving us the advantage\r\nof choosing our own ground and preparing it to fight him upon. The details\r\nmust, of course, be left to General Rosecrans, while we must furnish him\r\nthe means to the utmost of our ability. If you concur, I think he would\r\nbetter be informed that we are not pushing him beyond this position; and\r\nthat, in fact, our judgment is rather against his going beyond it. If he\r\ncan only maintain this position, without more, this rebellion can only eke\r\nout a short and feeble existence, as an animal sometimes may with a thorn\r\nin its vitals.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL A. E. BURNSIDE\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D.C., September 21, 1863.\r\n\r\nGENERAL BURNSIDE, Greenville, Tenn.:\r\n\r\nIf you are to do any good to Rosecrans it will not do to waste time with\r\nJonesboro. It is already too late to do the most good that might have been\r\ndone, but I hope it will still do some good. Please do not lose a moment.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

We have unabated confidence in you, and in your soldiers\r\nand officers. In the main you must be the judge as to what is to be\r\ndone. If I were to suggest, I would say, save your army by taking strong\r\npositions until Burnside joins you, when, I hope, you can turn the tide. I\r\nthink you had better send a courier to Burnside to hurry him up. We\r\ncannot reach him by telegraph. We suppose some force is going to you from\r\nCorinth, but for want of communication we do not know how they are\r\ngetting along. We shall do our utmost to assist you. Send us your present\r\npositions.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL W. S.

Your despatches to me of 9\r\nA.M., and to General Halleck of 2 P. M., yesterday, tell us nothing\r\nlater on those points.

The particular form of my despatch was\r\njocular, which I supposed you gentlemen knew me well enough to understand.\r\nGeneral Allen is considered here as a very faithful and capable officer,\r\nand one who would be at least thought of for quartermaster-general if that\r\noffice were vacant.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

I\r\ndirected her to tell you to use your own pleasure whether to stay or come,\r\nand I did not say it is sickly and that you should on no account come.\r\nSo far as I see or know, it was never healthier, and I really wish to see\r\nyou. Answer this on receipt.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL W. S.

You see he\r\ndoes not claim so many prisoners or captured guns as you were inclined\r\nto concede. He also confesses to heavy loss. An exchanged general of ours\r\nleaving Richmond yesterday says two of Longstreet's divisions and his\r\nentire artillery and two of Pickett's brigades and Wise's legion have gone\r\nto Tennessee. He mentions no other.\r\n\r\n\"CHICAMAUGA RIVER, SEPTEMBER 20.\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL COOPER, Adjutant-General:\r\n\r\n\"After two days' hard fighting we have\r\ndriven the enemy, after a desperate resistance, from several positions,\r\nand now hold the field; but he still confronts us.

LINCOLN, Fifth Avenue Hotel, New York:\r\n\r\nWe now have a tolerably accurate summing up of the late battle between\r\nRosecrans and Braag. The result is that we are worsted, if at all, only\r\nin the fact that we, after the main fighting was over, yielded the ground,\r\nthus leaving considerable of our artillery and wounded to fall into the\r\nenemy's hands., for which we got nothing in turn. We lost in general\r\nofficers one killed and three or four wounded, all brigadiers, while,\r\naccording to the rebel accounts which we have, they lost six killed\r\nand eight wounded: of the killed one major-general and five brigadiers\r\nincluding your brother-in-law, Helm; and of the wounded three\r\nmajor-generals and five brigadiers. This list may be reduced two in number\r\nby corrections of confusion in names. At 11.40 A.M. yesterday General\r\nRosecrans telegraphed from Chattanooga: \"We hold this point, and I cannot\r\nbe dislodged except by very superior numbers and after a great battle.\" A\r\ndespatch leaving there after night yesterday says, \"No fight to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

SCHOFIELD:\r\n\r\nThere is no organized military force in avowed opposition to the General\r\nGovernment now in Missouri, and if any shall reappear, your duty in regard\r\nto it will be too plain to require any special instruction. Still, the\r\ncondition of things, both there and elsewhere, is such as to render\r\nit indispensable to maintain, for a time, the United States military\r\nestablishment in that State, as well as to rely upon it for a fair\r\ncontribution of support to that establishment generally. Your immediate\r\nduty in regard to Missouri now is to advance the efficiency of that\r\nestablishment, and to so use it, as far as practicable, to compel the\r\nexcited people there to let one another alone.\r\n\r\nUnder your recent order, which I have approved, you will only arrest\r\nindividuals, and suppress assemblies or newspapers, when they may be\r\nworking palpable injury to the military in your charge; and in no other\r\ncase will you interfere with the expression of opinion in any form, or\r\nallow it to be interfered with violently by others. In this you have a\r\ndiscretion to exercise with great caution, calmness, and forbearance.\r\n\r\nWith the matter of removing the inhabitants of certain counties en masse,\r\nand of removing certain individuals from time to time, who are supposed\r\nto be mischievous, I am not now interfering, but am leaving to your own\r\ndiscretion.\r\n\r\nNor am I interfering with what may still seem to you to be necessary\r\nrestrictions upon trade and intercourse. I think proper, however, to\r\nenjoin upon you the following: Allow no part of the military under your\r\ncommand to be engaged in either returning fugitive slaves or in forcing or\r\nenticing slaves from their homes; and, so far as practicable, enforce the\r\nsame forbearance upon the people.\r\n\r\nReport to me your opinion upon the availability for good of the enrolled\r\nmilitia of the State. Allow no one to enlist colored troops, except upon\r\norders from you, or from here through you.\r\n\r\nAllow no one to assume the functions of confiscating property, under the\r\nlaw of Congress, or otherwise, except upon orders from here.\r\n\r\nAt elections see that those, and only those, are allowed to vote who are\r\nentitled to do so by the laws of Missouri, including as of those laws\r\nthe restrictions laid by the Missouri convention upon those who may have\r\nparticipated in the rebellion.\r\n\r\nSo far as practicable, you will, by means of your military force, expel\r\nguerrillas, marauders, and murderers, and all who are known to harbor,\r\naid, or abet them. But in like manner you will repress assumptions of\r\nunauthorized individuals to perform the same service, because under\r\npretense of doing this they become marauders and murderers themselves.\r\n\r\nTo now restore peace, let the military obey orders, and those not of the\r\nmilitary leave each other alone, thus not breaking the peace themselves.\r\n\r\nIn giving the above directions, it is not intended to restrain you in\r\nother expedient and necessary matters not falling within their range.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION FOR THANKSGIVING, OCTOBER 3, 1863.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nThe year that is drawing towards its close has been filled with the\r\nblessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies. To these bounties, which\r\nare so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from\r\nwhich they come, others have been added which are of so extraordinary a\r\nnature that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften even the heart which\r\nis habitually insensible to the ever-watchful providence of Almighty God.\r\nIn the midst of a civil war of unequalled magnitude and severity which has\r\nsometimes seemed to invite and provoke the aggressions of foreign states;\r\npeace has been preserved with all nations, order has been maintained, the\r\nlaws have been respected and obeyed, and harmony has prevailed everywhere\r\nexcept in the theatre of military conflict; while that theatre has been\r\ngreatly contracted by the advancing armies and navies of the Union. The\r\nneedful diversion of wealth and strength from the fields of peaceful\r\nindustry, to the national defense has not arrested the plough, the\r\nshuttle, or the ship: The axe has enlarged the borders of our settlements,\r\nand the mines, as well of, iron and coal as of the precious metals, have\r\nyielded even more abundantly than heretofore. Population has steadily\r\nincreased, notwithstanding the waste that has been made in the camp,\r\nthe siege, and the battle-field; and the country, rejoicing in the\r\nconsciousness of augmented strength and vigor, is permitted to expect a\r\ncontinuance of years, with large increase of freedom.\r\n\r\nNo human counsel hath devised, nor hath any mortal hand worked out these\r\ngreat things. They are the gracious gifts of the Most High God, who, while\r\ndealing with us in anger for our sins, hath nevertheless remembered mercy.\r\n\r\nIt has seemed to me fit and proper that they should be reverently,\r\nsolemnly, and gratefully acknowledged, as with one heart and voice, by the\r\nwhole American people. I do, therefore, invite my fellow-citizens in every\r\npart of the United States, and also those who are at sea, and those\r\nwho are sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the last\r\nThursday of November next as a day of thanksgiving and prayer to our\r\nbeneficent Father who dwelleth in the heavens. And I recommend to them\r\nthat, while offering up the ascriptions justly due to Him for such\r\nsingular deliverances and blessings, they do also, with humble penitence\r\nfor our national perverseness and disobedience, commend to His tender care\r\nall those who have become widows, orphans, mourners, or sufferers in the\r\nlamentable civil strife in which we are unavoidably engaged, and fervently\r\nimplore the interposition of the Almighty hand to heal the wounds of\r\nthe nation, and to restore it, as soon as may be consistent with divine\r\npurposes, to the full enjoyment of peace, harmony, tranquillity, and\r\nunion.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this third day of October, in the year\r\nof our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and of the\r\nindependence of the United States the eighty-eighth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:  WILLIAM H. SEWARD,\r\n  Secretary of State\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL J. M. SCHOFIELD.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON D.C., OCTOBER 4, 1863\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL SCHOFIELD, St. Louis, Mo.:\r\n\r\nI think you will not have just cause to complain of my action.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL W. S. ROSECRANS.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, October 4, 1863. 11.30 A.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL ROSECRANS, Chattanooga, Tenn.:\r\n\r\nYours of yesterday received. If we can hold Chattanooga and East\r\nTennessee, I think the rebellion must dwindle and die. I think you and\r\nBurnside can do this, and hence doing so is your main object. Of course\r\nto greatly damage or destroy the enemy in your front would be a greater\r\nobject, because it would include the former and more, but it is not so\r\ncertainly within your power. I understand the main body of the enemy is\r\nvery near you, so near that you could \"board at home,\" so to speak, and\r\nmenace or attack him any day. Would not the doing of this be your best\r\nmode of counteracting his raid on your communications? But this is not an\r\norder. I intend doing something like what you suggest whenever the case\r\nshall appear ripe enough to have it accepted in the true understanding\r\nrather than as a confession of weakness and fear.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO C. D. DRAKE AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October 5, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. CHARLES D. DRAKE AND OTHERS, Committee.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:-Your original address, presented on the 30th ult., and the\r\nfour supplementary ones presented on the 3d inst., have been carefully\r\nconsidered. I hope you will regard the other duties claiming my attention,\r\ntogether with the great length and importance of these documents, as\r\nconstituting a sufficient apology for not having responded sooner.\r\n\r\nThese papers, framed for a common object, consist of the things demanded\r\nand the reasons for demanding them.\r\n\r\nThe things demanded are\r\n\r\nFirst. That General Schofield shall be relieved, and General Butler be\r\nappointed as Commander of the Military Department of Missouri.\r\n\r\nSecond. That the system of enrolled militia in Missouri may be broken up,\r\nand national forces he substituted for it; and\r\n\r\nThird. That at elections persons may not be allowed to vote who are not\r\nentitled by law to do so.\r\n\r\nAmong the reasons given, enough of suffering and wrong to Union men is\r\ncertainly, and I suppose truly, stated. Yet the whole case, as presented,\r\nfails to convince me that General Schofield, or the enrolled militia, is\r\nresponsible for that suffering and wrong. The whole can be explained on a\r\nmore charitable, and, as I think, a more rational hypothesis.\r\n\r\nWe are in a civil war. In such cases there always is a main question, but\r\nin this case that question is a perplexing compound--Union and slavery.\r\nIt thus becomes a question not of two sides merely, but of at least four\r\nsides, even among those who are for the Union, saying nothing of those who\r\nare against it. Thus, those who are for the Union with, but not without\r\nslavery; those for it without, but not with; those for it with or without,\r\nbut prefer it with; and those for it with or without, but prefer it\r\nwithout.\r\n\r\nAmong these, again, is a subdivision of those who are for gradual, but\r\nnot for immediate, and those who are for immediate, but not for gradual\r\nextinction of slavery.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to conceive that all these shades of opinion, and even more,\r\nmay be sincerely entertained by honest and truthful men. Yet, all being\r\nfor the Union, by reason of these differences each will prefer a different\r\nway of sustaining the Union. At once, sincerity is questioned, and motives\r\nare assailed. Actual war comming, blood grows hot and blood is spilled.\r\nThought is forced from old channels into confusion. Deception breeds and\r\nthrives. Confidence dies, and universal suspicion reigns. Each man feels\r\nan impulse to kill his neighbor, lest he be killed by him. Revenge and\r\nretaliation follow. And all this, as before said, may be among honest men\r\nonly. But this is not all. Every foul bird comes abroad, and every dirty\r\nreptile rises up. These add crime to confusion. Strong measures\r\ndeemed indispensable, but harsh at best, such men make worse by\r\nmaladministration. Murders for old grudges, and murders for self, proceed\r\nunder any cloak that will best serve for the occasion.\r\n\r\nThese causes amply account for what has occurred in Missouri, without\r\nascribing it to the weakness or wickedness of any general. The newspaper\r\nfiles, those chroniclers of current events, will show that the evils now\r\ncomplained of were quite as prevalent under Fremont, Hunter, Halleck, and\r\nCurtis, as under Schofield. If the former had greater force opposed\r\nto them, they also had greater force with which to meet it. When the\r\norganized rebel army left the State, the main Federal force had to go\r\nalso, leaving the department commander at home relatively no stronger\r\nthan before. Without disparaging any, I affirm with confidence that no\r\ncommander of that department has, in proportion to his means, done better\r\nthan General Schofield.\r\n\r\nThe first specific charge against General Schofield is, that the enrolled\r\nmilitia was placed under his command, whereas it had not been placed under\r\nthe command of General Curtis. The fact is, I believe, true; but you do\r\nnot point out, nor can I conceive, how that did, or could, injure loyal\r\nmen or the Union cause.\r\n\r\nYou charge that, General Curtis being superseded by General Schofield,\r\nFranklin A. Dick was superseded by James O. Broadhead as Provost-Marshal\r\nGeneral. No very specific showing is made as to how this did or could\r\ninjure the Union cause. It recalls, however, the condition of things, as\r\npresented to me, which led to a change of commander of that department.\r\n\r\nTo restrain contraband intelligence and trade, a system of searches,\r\nseizures, permits, and passes, had been introduced, I think, by General\r\nFremont. When General Halleck came, he found and continued the system, and\r\nadded an order, applicable to some parts of the State, to levy and\r\ncollect contributions from noted rebels, to compensate losses and relieve\r\ndestitution caused by the rebellion. The action of General Fremont and\r\nGeneral Halleck, as stated, constituted a sort of system which General\r\nCurtis found in full operation when he took command of the department.\r\nThat there was a necessity for something of the sort was clear; but that\r\nit could only be justified by stern necessity, and that it was liable to\r\ngreat abuse in administration, was equally clear. Agents to execute it,\r\ncontrary to the great prayer, were led into temptation. Some might, while\r\nothers would not, resist that temptation. It was not possible to hold\r\nany to a very strict accountability; and those yielding to the temptation\r\nwould sell permits and passes to those who would pay most and most readily\r\nfor them, and would seize property and collect levies in the aptest way\r\nto fill their own pockets. Money being the object, the man having money,\r\nwhether loyal or disloyal, would be a victim. This practice doubtless\r\nexisted to some extent, and it was, a real additional evil that it could\r\nbe, and was, plausibly charged to exist in greater extent than it did.\r\n\r\nWhen General Curtis took command of the department, Mr. Dick, against\r\nwhom I never knew anything to allege, had general charge of this system.\r\nA controversy in regard to it rapidly grew into almost unmanageable\r\nproportions. One side ignored the necessity and magnified the evils of the\r\nsystem, while the other ignored the evils and magnified the necessity;\r\nand each bitterly assailed the other. I could not fail to see that the\r\ncontroversy enlarged in the same proportion as the professed Union men\r\nthere distinctly took sides in two opposing political parties. I exhausted\r\nmy wits, and very nearly my patience also, in efforts to convince both\r\nthat the evils they charged on each other were inherent in the case, and\r\ncould not be cured by giving either party a victory over the other.\r\n\r\nPlainly, the irritating system was not to be perpetual; and it was\r\nplausibly urged that it could be modified at once with advantage. The case\r\ncould scarcely be worse, and whether it could be made better could only\r\nbe determined by a trial. In this view, and not to ban or brand General\r\nCurtis, or to give a victory to any party, I made the change of commander\r\nfor the department. I now learn that soon after this change Mr. Dick was\r\nremoved, and that Mr. Broadhead, a gentleman of no less good character,\r\nwas put in the place. The mere fact of this change is more distinctly\r\ncomplained of than is any conduct of the new officer, or other consequence\r\nof the change.\r\n\r\nI gave the new commander no instructions as to the administration of\r\nthe system mentioned, beyond what is contained in the private letter\r\nafterwards surreptitiously published, in which I directed him to act\r\nsolely for the public good, and independently of both parties. Neither any\r\nthing you have presented me, nor anything I have otherwise learned, has\r\nconvinced me that he has been unfaithful to this charge.\r\n\r\nImbecility is urged as one cause for removing General Schofield; and\r\nthe late massacre at Lawrence, Kansas, is pressed as evidence of that\r\nimbecility. To my mind that fact scarcely tends to prove the proposition.\r\nThat massacre is only an example of what Grierson, John Morgan, and many\r\nothers might have repeatedly done on their respective raids, had they\r\nchosen to incur the personal hazard, and possessed the fiendish hearts to\r\ndo it.\r\n\r\nThe charge is made that General Schofield, on purpose to protect the\r\nLawrence murderers, would not allow them to be pursued into Missouri.\r\nWhile no punishment could be too sudden or too severe for those murderers,\r\nI am well satisfied that the preventing of the threatened remedial raid\r\ninto Missouri was the only way to avoid an indiscriminate massacre there,\r\nincluding probably more innocent than guilty. Instead of condemning, I\r\ntherefore approve what I understand General Schofield did in that respect.\r\n\r\nThe charges that General Schofield has purposely withheld protection from\r\nloyal people and purposely facilitated the objects of the disloyal are\r\naltogether beyond my power of belief. I do not arraign the veracity of\r\ngentlemen as to the facts complained of, but I do more than question the\r\njudgment which would infer that those facts occurred in accordance with\r\nthe purposes of General Schofield.\r\n\r\nWith my present views, I must decline to remove General Schofield. In\r\nthis I decide nothing against General Butler. I sincerely wish it were\r\nconvenient to assign him a suitable command. In order to meet some\r\nexisting evils I have addressed a letter of instructions to General\r\nSchofield, a copy of which I enclose to you.\r\n\r\nAs to the enrolled militia, I shall endeavor to ascertain better than\r\nI now know what is its exact value. Let me say now, however, that your\r\nproposal to substitute national forces for the enrolled militia implies\r\nthat in your judgment the latter is doing something which needs to be\r\ndone; and if so, the proposition to throw that force away and to supply\r\nits place by bringing other forces from the field where they are urgently\r\nneeded seems to me very extraordinary. Whence shall they come? Shall they\r\nbe withdrawn from Banks, or Grant, or Steele, or Rosecrans? Few things\r\nhave been so grateful to my anxious feelings as when, in June last, the\r\nlocal force in Missouri aided General Schofield to so promptly send\r\na large general force to the relief of General Grant, then investing\r\nVicksburg and menaced from without by General Johnston. Was this all\r\nwrong? Should the enrolled militia then have been broken up and General\r\nHerron kept from Grant to police Missouri? So far from finding cause to\r\nobject, I confess to a sympathy for whatever relieves our general force\r\nin Missouri and allows it to serve elsewhere. I therefore, as at present\r\nadvised, cannot attempt the destruction of the enrolled militia of\r\nMissouri. I may add that, the force being under the national military\r\ncontrol, it is also within the proclamation in regard to the habeas\r\ncorpus.\r\n\r\nI concur in the propriety of your request in regard to elections, and\r\nhave, as you see, directed General Schofield accordingly. I do not feel\r\njustified to enter upon the broad field you present in regard to the\r\npolitical differences between Radicals and Conservatives. From time to\r\ntime I have done and said what appeared to me proper to do and say.\r\nThe public knows it all. It obliges nobody to follow me, and I trust it\r\nobliges me to follow nobody. The Radicals and Conservatives each agree\r\nwith me in some things and disagree in others. I could wish both to agree\r\nwith me in all things, for then they would agree with each other, and\r\nwould be too strong for any foe from any quarter. They, however, choose to\r\ndo otherwise; and I do not question their right. I too shall do what\r\nseems to be my duty. I hold whoever commands in Missouri or elsewhere\r\nresponsible to me and not to either Radicals or Conservatives. It is my\r\nduty to hear all, but at last I must, within my sphere, judge what to do\r\nand what to forbear.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CASE OF DR. DAVID M. WRIGHT\r\n\r\nAPPROVAL OF THE DECISION OF THE COURT\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, ADJUTANT-GENERALS OFFICE,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, October 8, 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL J. G. FOSTER, Commanding Department of Virginia and North\r\nCarolina, Fort Monroe, Va.\r\n\r\nSIR:--The proceedings of the military commission instituted for the trial\r\nof David Wright, of Norfolk, in Special Orders Nos. 195, 196, and 197, of\r\n1863, from headquarters Department of Virginia, have been submitted to the\r\nPresident of the United States. The following are his remarks on the case:\r\n\r\nUpon the presentation of the record in this case and the examination\r\nthereof, aided by the report thereon of the Judge-Advocate-General, and\r\non full hearing of counsel for the accused, being specified that no proper\r\nquestion remained open except as to the sanity of the accused, I caused a\r\nvery full examination to be made on that question, upon a great amount of\r\nevidence, including all effort by the counsel for accused, by an expert\r\nof high reputation in that professional department, who thereon reports to\r\nme, as his opinion, that the accused, Dr. David M. Wright, was not insane\r\nprior to or on the 11th day of July, 1863, the date of the homicide of\r\nLieutenant Sanborn; that he has not been insane since, and is not insane\r\nnow (Oct. 7, 1863). I therefore approve the finding and sentence of the\r\nmilitary commission, and direct that the major-general in command of the\r\ndepartment including the place of trial, and wherein the convict is now in\r\ncustody, appoint a time and place and carry such sentence into execution.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

This led to a maneuvering of the two armies and to pretty\r\nheavy skirmishing on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. We have frequent\r\ndespatches from General Meade and up to 10 o'clock last night nothing had\r\nhappened giving either side any marked advantage. Our army reported to be\r\nin excellent condition.

When he shall\r\nbe, please notify me of the result, with a brief statement of his case, if\r\nhe be convicted. Gustave Blittersdorf, who you say is enlisted in the One\r\nhundred and nineteenth Pennsylvania Volunteers as William Fox, is proven\r\nto me to be only fifteen years old last January.

A. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October 16, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR GENERAL HALLECK:\r\n\r\nI do not believe Lee can have over 60,000 effective men.\r\n\r\nLongstreet's corps would not be sent away to bring an equal force back\r\nupon the same road; and there is no other direction for them to have come\r\nfrom.\r\n\r\nDoubtless, in making the present movement, Lee gathered in all available\r\nscraps, and added them to Hill's and Ewell's corps; but that is all, and\r\nhe made the movement in the belief that four corps had left General Meade;\r\nand General Meade's apparently avoiding a collision with him has confirmed\r\nhim in that belief. If General Meade can now attack him on a field no\r\nworse than equal for us, and will do so now with all the skill and courage\r\nwhich he, his officers, and men possess, the honor will be his if he\r\nsucceeds, and the blame may be mine if he fails.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCALL FOR 300,000 VOLUNTEERS, OCTOBER 17, 1863.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nA Proclamation.\r\n\r\nWhereas the term of service of a part of the Volunteer forces of the\r\nUnited States will expire during the coming year; and whereas, in addition\r\nto the men raised by the present draft, it is deemed expedient to call out\r\nthree hundred thousand volunteers to serve for three years or during the\r\nwar, not, however, exceeding three years:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, and\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy thereof, and of the militia of\r\nthe several States when called into actual service, do issue this my\r\nproclamation, calling upon the governors of the different States to\r\nraise, and have enlisted into the United States service, for the various\r\ncompanies and regiments in the field from their respective States, the\r\nquotas of three hundred thousand men.\r\n\r\n\r\nI further proclaim that all the volunteers thus called out and duly\r\nenlisted shall receive advance pay, premium, and bounty, as heretofore\r\ncommunicated to the governors of States by the War Department through the\r\nProvost-Marshal-General's office, by special letters.\r\n\r\nI further proclaim that all volunteers received under this call, as well\r\nas all others not heretofore credited, shall be duly credited and deducted\r\nfrom the quotas established for the next draft.\r\n\r\nI further proclaim that if any State shall fail to raise the quota\r\nassigned to it by the War Department under this call, then a draft for the\r\ndeficiency in said quota shall be made in said State, or in the districts\r\nof said State, for their due proportion of said quota, and the said draft\r\nshall commence on the 5th day of January, 1864.\r\n\r\nAnd I further proclaim that nothing in this proclamation shall interfere\r\nwith existing orders, or with those which may be issued for the present\r\ndraft in the States where it is now in progress, or where it has not yet\r\nbeen commenced.\r\n\r\nThe quotas of the States and districts will be assigned by the War\r\nDepartment through the Provost-Marshal-General's office, due regard being\r\nhad for the men heretofore furnished, whether by volunteering or drafting;\r\nand the recruiting will be conducted in accordance with such instructions\r\nas have been or may be issued by that department.\r\n\r\nIn issuing this proclamation, I address myself not only to the governors\r\nof the several States, but also to the good and loyal people thereof,\r\ninvoking them to lend their cheerful, willing, and effective aid to the\r\nmeasures thus adopted, with a view to reinforce our victorious army now in\r\nthe field, and bring our needful military operations to a prosperous end,\r\nthus closing forever the fountains of sedition and civil war.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the\r\nUnited States to be affixed.....................\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:  WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL FOSTER.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.C., October 17, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL FOSTER, Port Monroe, Va.:\r\n\r\nIt would be useless for Mrs. Dr. Wright to come here. The subject is a\r\nvery painful one, but the case is settled.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO W. B. THOMAS\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D.C., OCTOBER 17, 1863\r\n\r\nHON. WILLIAM B. THOMAS, Philadelphia, Pa.\r\n\r\nI am grateful for your offer of 100,000 men, but as at present advised\r\nI do not consider that Washington is in danger, or that there is any\r\nemergency requiring 60 or 90 days men.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO J. WILLIAMS AND N. G. TAYLOR.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, October 17, 1863.\r\n\r\nJOHN WILLIAMS AND N G. TAYLOR, Knoxville, Tenn.:\r\n\r\nYou do not estimate the holding of East Tennessee more highly than I do.\r\nThere is no absolute purpose of withdrawing our forces from it, and only a\r\ncontingent one to withdraw them temporarily for the purpose of not losing\r\nthe position permanently. I am in great hope of not finding it necessary\r\nto withdraw them at all, particularly if you raise new troops rapidly for\r\nus there.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO T. C. DURANT.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON CITY, October 18, 1863.\r\n\r\nT. C. DURANT, New York:\r\n\r\nAs I do with others, so I will try to see you when you come.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL W. S. ROSECRANS.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, October 19, 1863.9. A.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL ROSECRANS, Chattanooga, Tenn:\r\n\r\nThere has been no battle recently at Bull Run. I suppose what you have\r\nheard a rumor of was not a general battle, but an \"affair\" at Bristow\r\nStation on the railroad, a few miles beyond Manassas Junction toward the\r\nRappahannock, on Wednesday, the 14th. It began by an attack of the enemy\r\nupon General Warren, and ended in the enemy being repulsed with a loss of\r\nfour cannon and from four to seven hundred prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL R. C. SCHENCK.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October 21, 1863.2.45\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL SCHENCK, Baltimore, Md.:\r\n\r\nA delegation is here saying that our armed colored troops are at many, if\r\nnot all, the landings on the Patuxent River, and by their presence with\r\narms in their hands are frightening quiet people and producing great\r\nconfusion. Have they been sent there by any order, and if so, for what\r\nreason?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM TO GENERAL R. C. SCHENCK.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October 22, 1863.1.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL SCHENCK, Baltimore, Md.:\r\n\r\nPlease come over here. The fact of one of our officers being killed on the\r\nPatuxent is a specimen of what I would avoid. It seems to me we could\r\nsend white men to recruit better than to send negroes and thus inaugurate\r\nhomicides on punctilio.\r\n\r\nPlease come over.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October 24, 1863.\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK:\r\n\r\nTaking all our information together, I think it probable that Ewell's\r\ncorps has started for East Tennessee by way of Abingdon, marching\r\nlast Monday, say from Meade's front directly to the railroad at\r\nCharlottesville.\r\n\r\nFirst, the object of Lee's recent movement against Meade; his destruction\r\nof the Alexandria and Orange Railroad, and subsequent withdrawal\r\nwithout more motive, not otherwise apparent, would be explained by this\r\nhypothesis.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the direct statement of Sharpe's men that Ewell has gone to\r\nTennessee.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the Irishman's [Northern Spy in Richmond] statement that he has\r\nnot gone through Richmond, and his further statement of an appeal made\r\nto the people at Richmond to go and protect their salt, which could only\r\nrefer to the works near Abingdon.\r\n\r\nFourthly, Graham's statement from Martinsburg that Imboden is in retreat\r\nfor Harrisonburg. This last matches with the idea that Lee has retained\r\nhis cavalry, sending Imboden and perhaps other scraps to join Ewell. Upon\r\nthis probability what is to be done?\r\n\r\nIf you have a plan matured, I have nothing to say. If you have not, then\r\nI suggest that, with all possible expedition, the Army of the Potomac\r\nget ready to attack Lee, and that in the meantime a raid shall, at all\r\nhazards, break the railroad at or near Lynchburg.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO E. B. WASHBURNE.\r\n\r\n(Private and Confidential.)\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October 26, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. E. B. WASHBURNE.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Yours of the 12th has been in my hands several days.\r\nInclosed I send the leave of absence for your brother, in as good form as\r\nI think I can safely put it. Without knowing whether he would accept it. I\r\nhave tendered the collectorship at Portland, Maine, to your other brother,\r\nthe governor.\r\n\r\nThanks to both you and our friend Campbell for your kind words and\r\nintentions. A second term would be a great honor and a great labor, which,\r\ntogether, perhaps I would not decline if tendered.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SECRETARY CHASE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October 26, 1863.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--The writer of the accompanying letter is one of Mrs.\r\nLincoln's numerous cousins. He is a grandson of \"Milliken's Bend,\" near\r\nVicksburg--that is, a grandson of the man who gave name to Milliken's\r\nBend. His father was a brother to MRS. Lincoln's mother. I know not a\r\nthing about his loyalty beyond what he says. Supposing he is loyal, can\r\nany of his requests be granted, and if any, which of them?\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.",
