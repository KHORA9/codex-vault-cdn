He was connected in the family circle with _two[2]\r\neminent jurists, who were at hand to stimulate his young ambition, and\r\nto pour, in an almost perpetual stream, legal knowledge into his mind,\r\nby conversation and by epistolary correspondence. The time he spent in\r\nhis studies preparatory to his admission would be considered short at\r\nthe present day; but (to use the language of another) \"it is to be\r\nrecollected that at that time there were no voluminous treatises upon\r\nthe mere routine of practice to be committed to memory, without adding\r\na single legal principle or useful idea to the mind, and which only\r\nteach the law student, as has been said of the art of the rhetorician,\r\n'how to name his tools.' Burr, fortunately for his future professional\r\neminence, was not destined to graze upon this barren moor. He spent\r\nhis clerkship in reading and abstracting, with pen in hand, Coke and\r\nthe elementary writers, instead of Sellon and Tidd; and learnt law as\r\na science, and not as a mechanical art.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it has been said \"that Colonel Burr was not a\r\ndeep-read lawyer; that he showed himself abundantly conversant with\r\nthe general knowledge of the profession, and that he was skilful in\r\nsuggesting doubts and questions; but that he exhibited no indications\r\nof a fondness for the science, nor of researches into its abstruse\r\ndoctrines; that he seemed, indeed, to hold it and its administration\r\nin slight estimation. The best definition of law, he said, was\r\n'_whatever is boldly asserted and plausibly maintained_.' This sarcasm\r\nwas intended full as much for the courts as for the law administered\r\nby them.\"\r\n\r\nIf Colonel Burr may have been surpassed in legal erudition, he\r\npossessed other qualifications for successful practice at the bar\r\nwhich were seldom equalled. He prepared his trials with an industry\r\nand forethought that were most surprising. He spared no labour or\r\nexpense in attaining every piece of evidence that would be useful in\r\nhis attacks, or guard him against his antagonist. He was absolutely\r\nindefatigable in the conduct of his suits. \"He pursued (says a legal\r\nfriend) the opposite party with notices, and motions, and\r\napplications, and appeals, and rearguments, never despairing himself,\r\nnor allowing to his adversary confidence, nor comfort, nor repose.\r\nAlways vigilant and always urgent, until a proposition for compromise\r\nor a negotiation between the parties ensued. 'Now move slow (he would\r\nsay); never negotiate in a hurry.' I remember a remark he made on this\r\nsubject, which appeared to be original and wise. There is a saying,\r\n'Never put off till tomorrow what you can do to-day.' 'This is a\r\nmaxim,' said he, 'for sluggards. A better reading of the maxim\r\nis--_Never do to-day what you can as well do to-morrow_; because\r\nsomething may occur to make you regret your premature action.'\"\r\n\r\nI was struck, says the same friend, in his legal practice, with that\r\ntendency to mystery which was so remarkable in his conduct in other\r\nrespects. He delighted in surprising his opponents, and in laying, as\r\nit were, ambuscades for them. A suit, in which I was not counsel, but\r\nwhich has since passed professionally under my observation, will\r\nillustrate this point in his practice. It was an ejectment suit,\r\nbrought by him to recover a valuable tenement in the lower part of the\r\ncity, and in which it was supposed, by the able lawyers retained on\r\nthe part of the defendant, that the only question would, be on the\r\nconstruction of the will. On the trial they were surprised to find the\r\nwhole force of the plainfiff's case brought against the authenticity\r\nof an ancient deed, forming a link in their title, and of which, as it\r\nhad never, been questioned nor suspected, they had prepared merely\r\nformal proof; and a verdict of the jury, obtained by a sort, of\r\n_coup-de-main_, pronounced the deed a forgery. Two tribunals have\r\nsubsequently established the deed as authentic; but the plaintiff\r\nlived and died in the possession of the land in consequence of the\r\nverdict, while the law doubts, which form the only real questions in\r\nthe case, are still proceeding, at the customary snail's pace, through\r\nour courts to their final solution.\r\n\r\nTo be employed as an assistant by Mr. Burr was not to receive a\r\nsinecure. He commanded and obtained the constant and unremitted\r\nexertions of his counsel. It was one of the most remarkable\r\nexhibitions of the force of his character, this bending every one who\r\napproached him to his use, and compelling their unremitted, though\r\noften unwilling, labours in his behalf. His counsel would receive\r\nnotes from him at midnight, with questions which were sent for\r\nimmediate replies.\r\n\r\nHe showed nice discrimination in his selection of his professional\r\nassistants. When learning was required, he selected the most erudite.\r\nIf political influence could be suspected of having effect, he chose\r\nhis lawyers to meet or _improve_ the supposed prejudice or\r\npredilection. Eloquence was bought when it was wanted; and the cheaper\r\nsubstitute of brow-beating, and vehemence used when they were\r\nequivalent or superior. In nothing did he show greater skill than in\r\nhis measurement and application of his agents; and it was amusing to\r\nhear his cool discussion of the obstacles of prejudice, or ignorance,\r\nor interest, or political feeling to be encountered in various\r\ntribunals, and of the appropriate remedies and antidotes to be\r\nemployed, and by what persons they should be applied.\r\n\r\nEqual discrimination and acuteness was displayed in his political\r\nmovements. An anecdote which occurred in the contested election of\r\n1800 will exemplify this remark. Funds were required for printing, for\r\ncommittee-rooms, &c. The finance committee took down the names of\r\nleading democrats, and attached to each the sum they proposed to\r\nsolicit from him. Before attempting the collection, the list, at\r\nColonel Burr's request, was presented for his inspection. An\r\nindividual, an active partisan of wealth, but proverbially\r\nparsimonious, was assessed one hundred dollars. Burr directed that his\r\nname should be struck from the list; for, said he, you will not get\r\nthe money, and from the moment the demand is made upon him, his\r\nexertions will cease, and you will not see him at the polls during the\r\nelection. The request was complied with. On proceeding with the\r\nexamination, the name of another wealthy individual was presented; he\r\nwas liberal, but indolent; he also was assessed one hundred dollars.\r\nBurr requested that this sum should be _doubled_, and that be should\r\nbe informed that no labour would be expected from him except an\r\noccasional attendance at the committee-rooms to assist in folding\r\ntickets. He will pay you the two hundred dollars, and thank you for\r\nletting him off so easy. The result proved the correctness of these\r\nopinions. On that occasion Colonel Burr remarked, _that the knowledge\r\nand use of men consisted in placing each in his appropriate position_.\r\n\r\nHis imperturbable coolness and presence of mind were displayed in his\r\ncivil as well as in his military life. Against most of the\r\nvicissitudes of a trial he guarded by his forethought and minuteness\r\nof preparation. I was present myself, says the legal friend already\r\nreferred to, when he received with great composure a communication\r\nwhich would have startled most men. Mr. P. had long been an inmate of\r\nhis house; he had been connected with him in many respects and for\r\nmany years. Colonel Burr and two other lawyers were discussing a\r\nproposed motion in a chancery suit in which P. was the plaintiff, the\r\ncolonel himself having, an interest in the result. P. was then out of\r\ntown. A letter was brought in and handed to the colonel, which,\r\ntelling us to proceed with our debate, he carefully read, and then\r\nplaced it, in his customary manner, on the table, with the address\r\ndownwards. Our discussion proceeded earnestly for ten minutes at\r\nleast, when the colonel, who had listened with great attention, asked,\r\nin his gentlest tone, \"What effect would the death of P. have on the\r\nsuit?\" We started, and asked eagerly why he put the question. \"P. is\r\ndead,\" he replied, \"as this letter informs me; _will the suit abate?_\"\r\nThe colonel was himself ill at the time, and unable to leave his sofa;\r\nand even if there was some affectation in his demeanour, there was\r\ncertainly remarkable collectedness.\r\n\r\nColonel Burr commenced the practice of his profession at the close of\r\nthe revolution, under the most favourable auspices; and may be said at\r\none bound to have taken rank among the first lawyers of the day, and\r\nto have sustained it until he became vice president, at which time, it\r\nis believed, he had no superior at the bar, either in this state or in\r\nthe Union, nor even an equal, except General Hamilton.\r\n\r\nThe eclat which Burr, yet a beardless boy, had acquired by his\r\nadventurous march under Arnold to Canada, through our northeastern\r\nwilds, then a trackless desert; his gallant bearing at Quebec and\r\nMonalouth; his efficient services in the retreat of our army from Long\r\nIsland and New-York; and his difficult and delicate command on the\r\nlines of Westchester, followed him to private life, gathered around\r\nhim hosts of admirers and friends among our early patriots,\r\nparticularly the youthful portion of them, and no doubt essentially\r\naided him in making his successful professional _debut_. The name of\r\nthe chivalrous aid-de-camp who supported in his youthful arms the\r\ndying hero of Quebec was familiar in the mouths of men, and from one\r\nend of the continent to the other he was eulogized for his military\r\nprowess. Such were the cheering auspices under which he sheathed his\r\nsword when his physical energies would permit him no longer to wield\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"He was indefatigable,\" says another legal friend, \"in business, as he\r\nhad been in his previous studies, and no lawyer ever appeared before\r\nour tribunals with his cause better prepared for trial, his facts and\r\nlegal points being marshalled for combat with all the regularity and\r\nprecision of a consummate military tactician. No professional\r\nadversary, it is believed, has ever boasted of having broken or thrown\r\ninto confusion the solid columns into which he had formed them, or\r\nhaving found void spaces in their lengthened line, or to have beaten\r\nhim by a _ruse de guerre_ or a surprise.\r\n\r\n\"He never heeded expense in completing his preparations for trial;\r\nand, while laborious himself to an uncommon degree, he did not stint\r\nthe labours of others, so far as he could command or procure them.\r\nEvery pleading or necessary paper connected with his causes was in\r\ntile first place to be multiplied into numerous copies, and then\r\nabstracted or condensed into the smallest possible limits, but no\r\nmaterial point or idea was by any means to be omitted. His propensity\r\nto concision or condensation was a peculiar trait in his mind. He\r\nwould reduce an elaborate argument, extending over many sheets of\r\npaper, to a single page. Had he written the history of our revolution,\r\nwhich he once commenced, he would probably have compressed the whole\r\nof it in a single volume.\"\r\n\r\nIn his professional practice, he never solicited from an opponent any\r\nfavour or indulgence any more than he would have done from an armed\r\nfoe; but, at the same time, rarely withheld any courtesy that was\r\nasked of him, not inconsistent with the interest of his clients. He\r\nwas a strict practitioner, almost a legal _martinet_, and so fond of\r\nlegal technicalities, that he never omitted an opportunity of trying\r\nhis own skill and that of opposite counsel in special pleas,\r\ndemurrers, and exceptions in chancery, notwithstanding the risk of\r\npaying costs sometimes, though rarely incurred, and of protracting a\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nThe labour of drawing his pleadings and briefs, however, at least\r\nafter his return from Europe in 1812, always devolved upon others;\r\nand, with marginal notes of all the authorities which had been\r\nconsulted, from the year books downward, which were sometimes in law\r\nFrench and law Latin, to the last reports in England and some half a\r\ndozen of our states, in which may be properly called law English, were\r\nsubmitted to his critical acumen; his thousand doubts, suggestions,\r\nhints, and queries, which would start from his mind like a flash, and\r\nfor a moment seem to throw into inextricable confusion what had been\r\nlaboriously, and perhaps profoundly studied, at last would most\r\ngenerally be adopted without material alterations or additions.\r\n\r\nColonel Burr's mind cannot be said to have been a comprehensive one.\r\nIt was acute, analytical, perspicacious, discriminating,\r\nunimaginative, quick to conceive things in detail, but not calculated\r\nto entertain masses of ideas. He would never have gained celebrity as\r\nan author; but as a critic, upon whatever subject, his qualifications\r\nhave rarely been surpassed, though in literary matters and the fine\r\narts they were only exhibited in conversation. His colloquial powers\r\nwere impressive and fascinating, though he generally seemed a listener\r\nrather than a talker; but never failed to say a proper thing in the\r\nproper place.\"\r\n\r\nAs a public speaker, his ideas were not diffuse enough; or rather, he\r\nappeared to lack fluency to make a long, and what is called an\r\nelaborate argument upon any matter, however grave or momentous. In a\r\ncause in which he was employed as associate counsel with General\r\nHamilton, an incident occurred, in relation to Chief Justice Yates,\r\nnot unworthy recording. It speaks a language that cannot he\r\nmisunderstood, and is demonstrative of the influence which he had over\r\nthe feelings as well as the minds of his hearers. It was the\r\ncelebrated case of Le Guen vs. Gouverneur and Kemble, one of the most\r\nimportant, in regard to the legal questions and amount of property\r\ninvolved, which at that day had been brought before our tribunals, and\r\nin which case he completely triumphed. Only a short period previous to\r\nhis decease Colonel Burr remarked, that on this occasion he had\r\nacquired more money and more reputation as a lawyer than on any other\r\nduring his long practice at the bar. A letter was addressed to Thurlow\r\nWeed, Esq., requesting him to apply to the Hon. John Van Ness Yates,\r\nson of the late chief justice, and ascertain whether the incident, as\r\nreported, was founded on fact. To that letter Mr. Weed received the\r\nfollowing answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN VAN NESS YATES TO THURLOW WEED.\r\n\r\nAlbany, July 8th, 1837.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nAfter some difficulty in finding my father's notes of the argument in\r\nthe case of Le Guen vs. Gouverneur and Kemble, I have ascertained that\r\nthe account you showed me, given in the letter of M. L. Davis, Esq.,\r\nis in the main correct. My father's notes of General Hamilton's\r\nargument are _very copious_. Those of Colonel Burr's are _limited_, in\r\nthis way--\"Burr for plaintiff, I. The great principles of commercial\r\nlaw which apply to this case are\"--then follows a hiatus of some\r\nlines. After which, as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"II. The plaintiff\"--another _hiatus_.\r\n\r\n\"III. !!!!!\" and this concludes all I can find.\r\n\r\nHamilton's eloquence was (if I may be allowed the expression)\r\n_argumentative_, and induced no great elevation or depression of mind,\r\nconsequently could be easily followed by a note taker. Burr's was more\r\n_persuasive_ and _imaginative_. He first enslaved the _heart_, and\r\nthen led captive the, _head_. Hamilton addressed himself to the _head_\r\nonly. I do not, therefore, wonder that Burr engrossed all the\r\nfaculties of the hearer. Indeed, I have heard him often at the bar\r\nmyself, and always with the same effect. I do not recollect, in\r\nconversation, any particular allusion of my father's to Burr's\r\nargument in the case of Le Guen _vs_. Gouverneur and Kemble; but I\r\nhave frequently heard him say, that of all lawyers at the bar, Burr\r\nwas the most difficult to follow in the way of taking notes. Yet Burr\r\nwas very _concise_ in his language. He had no pleonasms or expletives.\r\nEvery word was in its proper place, and seemed to be the only one\r\nsuited to the place. He made few or no repetitions. If what he said\r\nhad been immediately committed to the press, it would want no\r\ncorrection.\r\n\r\nYours respectfully,\r\n\r\nJ. V. N. YATES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nColonel Burr's style of speaking at the bar was unique, or peculiarly\r\nhis own; always brief; never loud, vehement, or impassioned, but\r\nconciliating, persuasive, and impressive; and when his subject called\r\nfor gravity or seriousness, his manner was stern and peremptory. He\r\nwas too dignified ever to be a trifler; and his sarcasm, sometimes\r\nindulged in, rarely created a laugh, but powerfully told upon those\r\nwho had provoked it. His enunciation was slow, distinct, and emphatic;\r\nperhaps too emphatic; and this was pronounced, by his early and\r\ndevoted friend, Judge Paterson, [3] a fault in his mode of speaking\r\nwhile a youth, and seems never to have been fully corrected, as he did\r\nthat of rapid utterance, attaining the true medium for public speaking\r\nin this respect. He spoke with great apparent ease, but could not be\r\ncalled fluent, although he never appeared at a loss for words, which\r\nwere always so chaste and appropriate that they seemed to, have been\r\nas carefully selected before they fell from his lips as if they had\r\nbeen written down in a prepared speech and committed to memory. His\r\nmanner was dignified and courteous; his self-possession never for an\r\ninstant forsook him. He never appeared hurried or confused, or\r\nbetrayed the slightest embarrassment for want of ideas to support his\r\nargument, or language in which to clothe it; and possessed a memory so\r\nwell disciplined as never to forget any thing in the excitement of the\r\nlegal forum which in the retirement of his study he had intended to\r\nuse. He has frequently been heard to say that he possessed no\r\noratorical talents; that he never spoke with pleasure, or even\r\nself-satisfaction, and seemed unconscious of the effect which he\r\nproduced upon the minds of his audience.\r\n\r\nColonel Burr accorded the palm of eloquence to General Hamilton, whom\r\nhe frequently characterized as a man of strong and fertile\r\nimagination, of rhetorical and even poetical genius, and a powerful\r\ndeclaimer. Burr's ruling passion was an ardent love for military\r\nglory. Next to the career of arms, diplomacy, no doubt, would have\r\nbeen his choice, for which not only his courtly and fascinating\r\nmanners, but every characteristic of his mind peculiarly adapted him.\r\nIt is idle now to speculate upon what he might have been had\r\nWashington yielded to the importunities of Madison, Monroe, and\r\nothers, and appointed him minister to the French republic. Our\r\ncountry, before which he then stood in the original brightness of his\r\ncharacter, would have been honoured in the choice, both at home and\r\nabroad, and his own destiny, at least, would have been widely\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding oratory was not his forte, and he never spoke in\r\npublic with satisfaction to himself, still many anecdotes are told of\r\nhim which would show that the effect of his speeches were sometimes of\r\nunequalled power. It is said, that at the close of his farewell\r\naddress to the Senate of the United States on his retirement from the\r\nvice-presidency, there was scarcely a dry eye to be seen among his\r\ngrave auditors, many of whom were his bitter political adversaries.\r\nHis manner of speaking was any thing but declamatory, and more\r\nresembled an elevated tone of conversation, by which a man, without\r\nany seeming intention, pours his ideas in measured and beautiful\r\nlanguage into the minds of some small select circle, dislodging all\r\nwhich they may have previously entertained upon a particular subject,\r\nand fixing his own there, by the power of a seeming magical\r\nfascination, which he could render, when he chose, almost\r\nirresistible. To judge him by his success as a public speaker, few men\r\ncould be called more eloquent.\r\n\r\nAs a monument of his legal knowledge and talents, his trial at\r\nRichmond may be referred to. The two volumes of Reports which contain\r\nit exhibit on almost every page the impress of his great mind, in its\r\nsingular acuteness and perspicacity, and great powers of analysis and\r\nargument. On that trial were engaged some of the ablest lawyers of our\r\ncountry, and he manifestly took the lead of them all. But the\r\nabilities which he displayed, hour by hour, and day by day, through\r\nthat long protracted contest, in which the verdict sought for by those\r\nwho then wielded the political destinies of our country was an\r\nignominious death, were no less remarkable than his unshaken firmness\r\nand high moral elevation of deportment, struggling as he was for\r\nhonour and for life.\r\n\r\n_Fiat Justicia ruat coelum_, was the motto of Chief Justice Marshall\r\non the trial of Colonel Burr. He was acquitted, but his acquittal was\r\nnot owing to the clemency or partiality of his judges. His acuteness\r\nas a lawyer, and the adroitness with which he managed his defence,\r\ncontributed greatly, no doubt, in saving him from becoming a victim,\r\nthough his innocence of the charge of treason which had been brought\r\nagainst him could hardly have effected that acquittal. Here, then, his\r\ntalents have done some good to his country, even if it be of a\r\nnegative character. They saved it from a stain of blood, which would\r\nhave been as indelible as is that of Admiral Byng upon the escutcheon\r\nof England.\r\n\r\nAfter Colonel Burr's return from Europe in 1812, he was engaged in\r\nseveral important causes, in which he was preeminently successful. His\r\nlegal opinion in the great steam-boat cause aided in breaking up that\r\nmonopoly. He was originally employed in the important land trial of\r\nMrs. Bradstreet, and in the Eden causes, involving a large amount of\r\nproperty in the city of New-York, and turning upon some of the nicest\r\npoints of the most difficult branch of the law of real property: he\r\ntriumphed over almost the entire force of the New-York bar, backed by\r\npowerful corporations and individuals of great wealth, which they\r\nprofusely lavished in a long-protracted contest. He commenced the Eden\r\nsuits in opposition to an opinion which bad been given by General\r\nHamilton, Richard Harrison, and other members of the profession of\r\nhigh standing, and on the faith of which opinions the parties in\r\npossession of the lands had purchased and held them at the time the\r\nsuits were commenced.\r\n\r\nHad Colonel Burr assiduously pursued the study of law through life,\r\nlike Marshall, Kent, and others, it is not easy to conjecture to what\r\nelevated point he might have risen; but such was not his destiny; the\r\nbent of his genius, which had received its inclination at the stirring\r\nperiod of the world when he entered into active life, was military.\r\nBut to show his persevering industry in his practice as a lawyer, and\r\nhis power of enduring fatigue, even when almost an octogenarian, the\r\nfollowing letter, written by him, is inserted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlbany, March, 1834.\r\n\r\nGermond's, Wednesday Evening.\r\n\r\nArrived this evening between 6 and 7 o'clock, having been _forty-five_\r\nhours in the stage without intermission, except to eat a hearty meal.\r\nStages in very bad order--roads excellent for wheels to Peekskill, and\r\nthence very good sleighing to this city. The night was uncomfortable;\r\nthe curtains torn and flying all about, so that we had plenty of fresh\r\nair.\r\n\r\nThe term was closed this day. Nelson will hold the Special Court\r\nto-morrow morning--have seen both Wendell and O'Connor this\r\nevening--all ready--came neither fatigued nor sleepy.\r\n\r\nA.

For the remarks which I am now about to present to the reader I am\r\nprincipally indebted to two highly intelligent members of the bar.\r\n_Either_ of whom is fully competent to a development of Colonel Burr's\r\nlegal character; and _neither_ of whom would be disqualified by any\r\nprejudices in his _favour_.

Colonel Burr's brother-in-law, Judge _Tappan Reeve_, and his uncle,\r\n_Pierpont Edwards_.\r\n\r\n3. see Vol. I., Ch. III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore entering upon the details connected with the election of 1800,\r\na brief history of the rise and progress of political parties in the\r\nState of New-York is deemed necessary. By the Constitution adopted\r\nduring the revolutionary war, the state was divided into four\r\ndistricts, viz., The Southern, the Middle, the Eastern, and the\r\nWestern. In the Southern District was included the counties of\r\nRichmond (_Staten Island_), Kings, Queens, and Suffolk (_Long\r\nIsland_), New-York (_Manhattan Island_), and Westchester. These six\r\ncounties, from the autumn of 1776 until the summer of 1783, were in a\r\ngreat measure in the possession of the British forces, and those\r\nportions of them which were nominally within the American lines were\r\ngenerally inhabited by tories and refugees. Lord North, or the most\r\nunrelenting of his followers, were not as much opposed to American\r\nindependence as were the tories of the united provinces. The city of\r\nNew-York became the rendezvous of the most intelligent and influential\r\nof this class. From this point they communicated with the British\r\npremier, through their correspondents in London. Many of them that\r\nwere in exile from their late homes in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and\r\nConnecticut, left their families behind them, under the protection of\r\nthe whigs. By this arrangement facilities were afforded for\r\nascertaining the position, resources, and movements of the rebel\r\narmies. These facilities were not neglected, and the information thus\r\nobtained was promptly communicated to the British commander-in-chief\r\nin New-York, and to the ministry in England. The whigs felt that\r\ningratitude was returned for their hospitality, and, in consequence,\r\nthey became daily more incensed against the tories.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the war would have terminated in 1780 or 1781, if\r\nthe British minister and his military commanders in America had not\r\nbeen constantly led into errors by the opinions and advice of the\r\nrefugees, but especially those residing in the city of New-York.\r\nEntertaining such views, the suffering whigs, in their most trying\r\nhours, consoled themselves with the hope and belief that, when the\r\nstruggle should terminate and the country become independent, their\r\noppressors and persecutors would no longer be permitted to remain\r\namong them. These were the predominant feelings of the men who were\r\nperilling their lives and enduring every species of privation and\r\nhardship for the freedom of their native land.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1778, Joseph Galloway, formerly of Philadelphia,\r\nsailed for England. His correspondence was extensive, and he became\r\nthe depository of all the grievances of the American loyalists. He was\r\nthe medium of communication between them, Lord North, and Lord George\r\nGermain. He possessed, in a high degree, the confidence of those who\r\nwere the conscience keepers of the king. Among the correspondents of\r\nMr. Galloway may be enumerated William Franklin, former governor of\r\nNew-Jersey, Daniel Cox, and David Ogden, members of his majesty's\r\ncouncil in New-Jersey, the Rev. Dr. Inglis, subsequently bishop of\r\nNova Scotia, and Isaac Ogden, counsellor at law of New-York, John\r\nPotts, a judge of the Common Pleas in Philadelphia, John Foxcroft,\r\npostmaster general of North America, &c., &c. None of Mr. Galloway's\r\ncorrespondents exhibited a more vindictive spirit than the Rev. Bishop\r\nInglis. These letters were private and confidential, excepting so far\r\nas, the ministry were concerned, for whose use most of them were\r\nintended. None of them, it is believed, have ever heretofore found\r\ntheir way into print. They are now matters of history. They are well\r\ncalculated to develop the secret designs of the tories, and, at the\r\nsame time, they afford the strongest view that could be given of the\r\npatriotism, the sufferings, and the untiring perseverance of the sons\r\nof liberty in those days. Some extracts will now be made from the\r\noriginal manuscripts, for the purpose of showing, in a limited degree,\r\nthe cause, and thus far justifying the hostile feelings of the whigs\r\ntowards the refugees.\r\n\r\nThe _Rev. Bishop Inglis_, under date of the 12th December, 1778,\r\nsays--\"Not less than sixty thousand of the rebels have perished by\r\nsickness and the sword since the war began, and these chiefly farmers\r\nand labourers. I consider it certain that a famine is inevitable if\r\nthe war continues two years longer; nay, one year war more will bring\r\ninexpressible distress on the country with regard to provisions, and\r\nthis will affect the rebellion not less than the depreciation of their\r\npasteboard dollars. The rebellion, be assured, is on the decline. Its\r\nvigour and resources are nearly spent, and nothing but a little\r\nperseverance and exertion on the part of Britain is necessary to\r\nsupress it totally. Butler and Brandt's forces, Indians and loyalists,\r\nI am told, amount to five or six thousand men. They have distressed\r\nand terrified the rebels more since last spring than the whole royal\r\narmy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Isaac Ogden_, under date 22d November, 1778, says--\"Thus has ended a\r\ncampaign (if it deserve the appellation) without anything capital\r\nbeing done or even attempted. How will the historian gain credit who\r\nshall relate, that _at least_ twenty-four thousand of the best troops\r\nin the world were shut up within their own lines by fifteen thousand,\r\n_at most_, of poor wretches, who were illy paid, badly fed, and worse\r\nclothed, and scarce, at best, deserved the name of soldiers?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Daniel Cox_, under date of 17th December, 1778, says--\"Ned Biddle has\r\ndeclined his seat in Congress. The truth is, he means to do more\r\nessential service in the assembly, which has ordered the general sense\r\nof the people to be taken respecting the present constitution of\r\nPennsylvania. Joe Reed is elected, and accepted the honour of being\r\npresident and commander-in-chief of the state.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_John Potts_, under date 1st March, 1779, says--\"An opinion prevails\r\nhere that government (the British) will adopt the mode of devastation.\r\nIf that should really take place, adieu to all the hopes of the\r\nfriends of government ever again living in America. Be assured that,\r\nshould government be restored by such means, her friends would find it\r\nimpossible to travel this country without a guard to prevent\r\nassassination. This is not only my opinion, but the real sentiments of\r\nevery friend to government. I have conversed with none, except some of\r\nthe violent tories, indeed, of New England, _who seem to partake of\r\nthe savage temper of our countrymen_.\" G---- N----[1] has said, in a\r\nconfidential letter to a friend of his, \"that government wish to get\r\nrid of this country, and is only at a loss how to do it without\r\nleaving it in a situation to injure her.\"\r\n\r\n_Daniel Cox_, 28th February, 1779, says--\"At any rate, I see absolute\r\nruin attend us poor attainted loyalists should the colonies be given\r\nup, or this place (New-York) be evacuated. I once fondly imagined\r\nneither would happen. I wish that our old friend, the Black Prince, [2]\r\ncould have the direction here again, and have the glory of conducting\r\nthe future operations to a happy conclusion. I think he is more\r\ncalculated for it than somebody [3] else, who, though he may possess\r\nzeal and honesty, wants head.\"\r\n\r\n_Isaac Ogden_, 8th March, 1779, says--\"Admiral Gambier is ordered from\r\nthis station, to the universal joy of all ranks and conditions. I\r\nbelieve no person was ever more generally detested by navy, army, and\r\ncitizen, than this penurious old reptile.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Daniel Cox_, 10th April, 1779, says--\"In an open letter to me, Mrs.\r\nCox speaks of the increasing depreciation of the continental money,\r\nunder the allegory of an old acquaintance of mine lying in a deep\r\nconsumption. Should Great Britain be really treating, and give us up,\r\nthere must be an end to her glory. But such a misfortune I can never\r\nbelieve her subject to, unless from her own folly and internal\r\nfactions of the accursed opposition.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thomas Eddy_, under date 5th month, 3d, 1779, says--\"From accounts\r\nreceived by last packet of the determined resolution of government to\r\npursue the war in America with vigour, I am led to believe that the\r\nleaders in the rebellion must give up before fall. Indeed, when I\r\nconsider the dissatisfaction universally prevalent caused by the\r\nbadness of their money, I should not be surprised if such an event\r\nwould take place as soon as General, Clinton opens the campaign.\"\r\n\r\n_Bishop, Inglis_, 14th May, 1779, says--\"Remonstrate loudly to those\r\nin authority against treating with the Congress--treating with them is\r\nestablishing them, and teaching the Americans to look up to them for\r\ndeliverance and protection. We have been guilty of a fatal error in\r\nthis from the beginning; we now see and feel the consequences. This\r\nshould teach us wisdom and better policy. Though we should conquer the\r\nrebels, yet, if an accommodation is settled with the Congress, I shall\r\nconsider the colonies as eventually lost, and that in a little time,\r\nto Great Britain.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_John Potts_, 15th May, 1779, says--\"In my last I mentioned some\r\nsanguine hopes which I could not help entertaining, from the prospect\r\nof an election to be held in the beginning of April, for a new\r\nconvention, as they call it, in Pennsylvania. Those hopes are now\r\ntotally destroyed by the efforts of Joe Reed [4] and the violent\r\nparty. Their artful cry of tory against the party in favour of the\r\nconvention raised a flame too great to be withstood, and procured more\r\nthan twelve thousand signers to petitions against that measure, in\r\nconsequence of which the assembly rescinded the resolution for holding\r\nthe election.\"\r\n\r\n\"The person to whom I alluded in my last letter is the woman whom I\r\nmentioned to you last fall as so truly enterprising. She has brought\r\nthree messages through the winter. From her I have this much further\r\nto assure you, that great preparations are making at Pittsburgh for\r\nthe reception of troops.\r\n\r\n\"The friends of government all agree that they will be content to risk\r\nfor ever every future hope and prospect of being restored to their\r\nestates, provided Great Britain will but secure her own authority\r\nfully before any terms are listened to; and, when that is acknowledged\r\nand established, then grant terms as liberal as she pleases,\r\nconsistent with good government and future security.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bishop Inglis_, 3d September, 1779, says--\"General Tryon made two or\r\nthree descents on the coast of Connecticut, and burnt the towns of\r\nFairfield and Norwalk. He was accompanied by a large body of refugees,\r\nwho were extremely useful, and behaved with a resolution and\r\nintrepidity which did them great honour. Had the descents on\r\nConnecticut _been longer continued and carried on more extensively,\r\nthe most salutary consequences might be apprehended_.\r\n\r\n\"The delusive notion of treating with Congress, I find, still prevails\r\nin some degree among you. Yet nothing could be more destructive to the\r\ninterest of government. Treating with them would be confirming their\r\nusurpation. The loyalists, universally dread this above all things.\r\nHowever they may differ in opinion on other points, they are unanimous\r\nand united in this; and where so many are perfectly agreed in a matter\r\nwhich is level to all understandings, it must be the evident dictate\r\nof truth and reason.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Isaac Ogden_, 20th September, 1779, says--\"You may well ask what we\r\nare doing here. Our army is now (including the garrison from Rhode\r\nIsland) at least twenty-four thousand men, a number sufficient to\r\nmarch through the whole continent; but what do numbers avail when they\r\nare cooped up in this dastardly manner? A want of knowledge of the\r\ncountry, a want of enterprise, or a want of something else, God only\r\nknows what, has prevented any and every attempt to interfere with the\r\nenemy. It is not a want of sufficient force, neither is it because it\r\nwas impracticable. These are facts that the warmest of the rebels\r\nacknowledge. Their force is really despicable when compared to the\r\narmy here. How is General Vaughan? I sincerely wish to see him at the\r\nhead of the army here, as he is the only general that has been here\r\nthat would listen to the advice of the American loyalists.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bishop Inglis_, 6th of November, 1779, says--\"We have now within our\r\nlines upward of twenty-six thousand effective men, as I have been\r\ninformed. Such a force, if led out and exerted with judgment and\r\nspirit, could not be resisted by the rebels--it must bear down all\r\nopposition. It is reported that Sir Henry Clinton is appointed sole\r\ncommissioner, with authority to choose five assistants as a counsel,\r\nand that he is vested with power to treat with Congress, &c. It may be\r\nvery proper to have a commissioner here, vested with extensive powers;\r\nbut as to any hopes of treating with Congress about an accommodation,\r\nbe assured they are visionary. Congress have done enough to dissipate\r\nall such fond expectations, unless their independence is acknowledged;\r\nand I should be heartily sorry if a measure so dishonourable to the\r\nnation, as treating with the Congress in any respect, were adopted.\r\nInsult and obstinacy is all that can be expected from them.\r\n\r\n\"With respect to the rebellion, I am clearly of opinion that it daily\r\ndeclines. Washington is the man to whom the army look for redress and\r\nsupport. He is _now_ in America what Monk was in England in 1659. I\r\nwish I could say in every respect. Were he equally disposed, he might\r\neffect as sudden and total a revolution, here as honest George Monk\r\ndid then in England.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Isaac Ogden_, 16th December, 1779, says--\"There is an anecdote of\r\nGeneral Grey that I have lately heard and believe to be true, though\r\nthe fact cannot now be fully ascertained. Just before the battle of\r\nBrandywine, an officer was despatched home by General Howe. General\r\nGrey undertook to give him his instructions how to demean himself on\r\nhis arrival in London, &c. A copy of these instructions was found by a\r\ncountryman, and delivered to Joe Shippen (Secretary _Joe_,) who now\r\nhas them in Philadelphia. A gentleman here has seen them. As he\r\nrelated them to me, you have them. 'You will first go to Lord George\r\nGermain; he will ask you such and such question; you will answer them\r\n_so and so_. You will then be sent to Lord North, who will ask you\r\nthese questions; you will thus answer them. You will then be sent to\r\nthe king, who will also ask you, &c.; you are also to give him these\r\nanswers. You will then be examined by the queen. She is a sensible\r\nwoman. You must answer with caution, but, of all things, be careful\r\nthat you say nothing that will condemn the conduct of General Howe.'\r\nSome pains are taken to procure this paper from Mr. Shippen; if it can\r\nbe obtained, you will have it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_David Ogden_, 3d December, 1779, says--\"What gives me great concern\r\nis the fear of a dishonourable peace being made with the rebels. My\r\nfears arise from what I am told many of the officers in the army give\r\nout that America can never be conquered; and the sooner it is given\r\nup, and independence admitted by the crown and parliament, the better\r\nfor Great Britain; and I am also informed that they have wrote to that\r\npurpose to their friends in England. What effect this may have on your\r\nside of the Atlantic, backed by the anti-ministerial party with you,\r\nenemies to monarchy and the great supporters of the rebellion in\r\nAmerica, time must show; but I am persuaded that the present ministers\r\nwill never give the least countenance to the independence of America.\r\nThe laying the country waste has been called cruelty by the favourers\r\nof the rebellion, and said to be below the character of Britons; but\r\nin cases of rebellion, it has always, by the most civilized nations,\r\nbeen held justifiable, and no history affords an instance of calling\r\nit cruelty. The great mercy shown the rebels since the commencement of\r\nthe rebellion is esteemed to be the greatest cruelty, as the lives of\r\nmany thousands would have been preserved by a vigorous, exertion of\r\nthe king's troops to distress the rebels wherever they marched, having\r\na strict regard not to injure the loyalists.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Daniel Cox_, 7th December, 1779, says--\"Should you see Joe Reed's\r\nlate speech to the assembly of Pennsylvania, you would imagine they\r\nfelt no shock from the Georgia defeat. [5]\r\n\r\nIf but common means are actively employed and properly conducted, the\r\nrebellion must be crushed totally next campaign. I doubt not every\r\neffort in the power of Congress, both abroad and at home, will be made\r\nto carry themselves through another year; but, if you are successful\r\nat home, they must go to the devil. For God's sake, therefore, do not\r\nbe frightened nor give us up; all must go right if You are but firm.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to General Arnold's treason during the\r\nsummer of 1780.[6]\r\n\r\nFrom the private correspondence of Mr. Galloway, it appears, that as\r\nearly as the autumn of 1778 Arnold was considered by the refugees as\r\n\"_lenient_,\" if not friendly to them, and in this light was\r\nrepresented to the British ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Charles Stewart_, under date of the 17th December, 1778,\r\nsays--\"General Arnold is in Philadelphia. It is said that he will be\r\ndischarged, being thought a _pert tory_. Certain it is that he\r\nassociates mostly with those people, and is to be married to Miss\r\nShippen, daughter of Edward Shippen, Esq.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_David Sproat_, 11th January, 1779, says--\"You will also hear that\r\nGeneral Arnold, commandant in Philadelphia, has behaved with lenity to\r\nthe tories, and that he is on the eve of marriage to one of Edward\r\nShippen's daughters.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_James Humphreys, Jun_. (printer), 8th of April, 1779, says--\"General\r\nArnold has been accused by the council of sundry misdemeanors. He has\r\ninsisted upon a trial by a court martial, and was triumphantly\r\nacquitted. The Congress, however, have thought proper to remove him\r\nfrom his command in the city of Philadelphia, he being of too lenient\r\na disposition to answer their cruel purposes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis correspondence also develops the conflicting views which were\r\ntaken by the tories as to the operations of the British army. So far\r\nas it had any influence, it was calculated to embarrass the ministry.\r\nOnly two very short extracts will be given on this subject. The\r\ndividing point between the northern and the southern tories was\r\nwhether the main army should take possession of Hudson's river, or the\r\nisthmus between Newcastle and Chesapeake Bay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bishop Inglis_, May 14th, 1779, says--\"I am still of opinion that\r\ntaking possession of Hudson's river should be the first object. When\r\nthat is done, which will effectually divide the rebel forces,\r\ncircumstances should determine whether our operations should be\r\ndirected eastward or westward.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_John Potts_, December 17th, 1778, says--\"If government means to\r\npursue this matter, she must spare men enough to take possession of\r\nthe isthmus between Newcastle and Chesapeake Bay, and, by clearing\r\nthat country of rebels, procure sufficient provision and forage for\r\nthe whole British force in America. That country can also supply the\r\nfleet with a great quantity of naval stores. The whole trade of\r\nMaryland and Pennsylvania will be destroyed, and a great part of\r\nVirginia. The interior of that peninsula is better disposed towards\r\nthe British government than any other country in the middle colonies.\r\nIf possession of Rhode Island and this place (New-York) is retained,\r\nand that post taken, America has no access to sea from any\r\nintermediate port but Egg Harbour, which will then be scarcely an\r\nobject. This is your plan, excepting the possession of Philadelphia\r\nand Bordentown, and, as the troops would not be dispersed too much,\r\nwould, for that reason, be more eligible.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1778--79, the tories had it in contemplation to\r\nestablish a regular corps for the purpose of plundering the whigs.\r\nAbout this period Colonel Burr took command of the lines in\r\nWestchester. His opinion of this system of warfare is expressed in a\r\nletter to General McDougall from which the following is\r\nextracted--\"Colonel Littlefield, with the party, returned this\r\nmorning. Notwithstanding the cautions I gave, and notwithstanding\r\nColonel Littlefield's good intentions, I blush to tell you that the\r\nparty returned loaded with plunder. Sir, till now I never wished for\r\narbitrary power. I could gibbet half a dozen _good_ whigs with all the\r\nvenom of an inveterate tory.\" [7]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet the reader compare the above _whig_ sentiment with the following\r\n_tory_ arrangement:--\r\n\r\n_Christopher Sower_, 1st March, 1779, says--\"An association is signing\r\nhere (New-York), according to which the loyalists are to form\r\nthemselves into companies of fifty men each; choose their own\r\nofficers; to have the _disposal_ of all prisoners by them taken; to\r\nmake excursions against the rebels, plunder them, sell the spoil,\r\nappoint an agent to receive the money, and to divide it among them in\r\nequal shares.\" [8]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1779 the refugees in New-York formed a board of\r\ndelegates from the several provinces. In reference to it, _Daniel\r\nCox_, December 7th, 1779, says--\"I have lately brought about a general\r\nrepresentation of all the refugees from the respective colonies, which\r\nnow compose a board, called the board of refugees, and of which I have\r\nthe honour at present to be president. We vote by colonies, and\r\nconduct our debates in quite a parliamentary style.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Christopher Sower_, the 5th of December, 1779, says--\"The deputies of\r\nthe refugees from the different provinces meet once a week. Daniel\r\nCox, Esq., was appointed to the chair, to deprive him of the\r\nopportunity of speaking, as he has the gift of saying little with many\r\nwords.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly one more extract will be given from the correspondence of Mr.\r\nGalloway, and that relates to the doings of this board of refugees.\r\nAmong their labours, the manner of bringing the war to a speedy\r\ntermination, and the formation of a constitution for the British\r\nprovinces, engrossed their attention. No comments will be made on the\r\nplan; but it will not be found unworthy a careful perusal. Although\r\npresented as the individual suggestion of Mr. Ogden, it is evident,\r\nfrom other portions of the correspondence, that it was not unadvised,\r\nand, to the American reader, is now an amusing document.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_David Ogden_, 3d December, 1779, says--\"When America submits to the\r\ncrown of Great Britain, which I take as a matter certain, and will\r\nsoon happen if proper measures are not neglected--pray, will not a\r\nconstitution and government, in a manner something similar to the\r\nfollowing, be most for the honour, security, peace, and interest of\r\nGreat Britain, and also for the happiness and safety of America, and\r\nmost compatible to the spirit and genius of both?\r\n\r\n\"That the right of taxation of America by the British parliament be\r\ngiven up. That the several colonies be restored to their former\r\nconstitutions and forms of government, except in the instances after\r\nmentioned. That each colony have a governor and council appointed by\r\nthe crown, and a house of representatives to be elected by the\r\nfreeholders, inhabitants of the several counties, not more than forty\r\nnor less than thirty for a colony, who shall have power to make all\r\nnecessary laws for the internal government and benefit of each\r\nrespective colony that are not repugnant or contradictory to the laws\r\nof Great Britain, or the laws of the American parliament, made and\r\nenacted to be in force in the colonies for the government, utility,\r\nand safety of the whole. That an American parliament be established\r\nfor all the English colonies on the continent, to consist of a lord\r\nlieutenant, barons (to be created for that purpose), not to exceed, at\r\npresent, more than twelve, nor less than eight from each colony, to be\r\nappointed by his majesty out of the freeholders, inhabitants of each\r\ncolony; a house of commons, not to exceed twelve nor less than eight,\r\nfrom each colony, to be elected by the respective houses of\r\nrepresentatives for each colony, which parliament, so constituted, to\r\nbe three branches of legislature of the northern colonies, and to be\r\nstyled and called the Lord Lieutenant, the Lords, and Commons of the\r\nBritish Colonies in North America. That they have the power of\r\nenacting laws, in all cases whatsoever, for the general good, benefit,\r\nand security of the colonies, and for their mutual safety, both\r\ndefensive and offensive, against the king's enemies, rebels, &c.;\r\nproportioning the taxes to be raised in such cases by each colony. The\r\nmode for raising the same to be enacted by the general assembly of\r\neach colony, which, if refused or neglected, be directed and\r\nprescribed by the North American parliament, with power to levy the\r\nsame. That the laws of the American parliament shall be in force till\r\nrepealed by his majesty in council; and the laws of the several\r\nlegislatures of the respective colonies to be in force till the same\r\nbe repealed by his majesty, or made void by an act and law of the\r\nAmerican parliament. That the American parliament have the\r\nsuperintendence and government of the several colleges in North\r\nAmerica, most of which have been the grand nurseries of the late\r\nrebellion, instilling into the tender minds of youth principles\r\nfavourable to republican, and against a monarchical government, and\r\nother doctrines incompatible to the British constitution.\r\n\r\n\"A constitution and government something similar to the above, I am\r\nconvinced, from the knowledge I have of the temper and spirit of the\r\ninhabitants of the colonies, will be most acceptable to them in\r\ngeneral (it being what they wish for), and will also be conducive to\r\nestablish a continued and lasting peace and harmony between Great\r\nBritain and the colonies. The Congress, no doubt, as it will deprive\r\nthem of their power, will oppose the same by every artifice, as well\r\nas every other plan of accommodation that will lessen their grandeur\r\nand consequence. I am therefore persuaded that the Congress had best\r\nbe altogether disregarded in any overtures of accommodation to be made\r\nor proposed, and all treaties with them absolutely refused, either\r\ndirectly with them, or indirectly through the courts of France and\r\nSpain, as men void of faith, or even common justice--deceivers of the\r\npeople, and enemies to the public weal and happiness of mankind. And\r\nto facilitate a submission instead of a treaty, proceed with the army\r\nagainst the rebels with vigour and spirit, and issue a proclamation\r\ncontaining a constitution for North America, and a pardon to all who\r\nlay down their arms and take the oath of allegiance to his majesty and\r\nhis government, _excepting_, as necessary examples of justice,\r\n\r\n\"_First_. The several members of the Continental Congress who have\r\nbeen elected and served as members thereof since the declaration of\r\nIndependence.\r\n\r\n\"_Second_. All governors, presidents of the supreme executive councils\r\nor of other councils, or of any of the colonies, acting under the\r\nCongress, or any new and usurped form of government.\r\n\r\n\"_Third_. All those who have been by his majesty appointed of his\r\ncouncil in any of the colonies, and since taken an active part in the\r\ncivil or military department under the Congress or under any\r\nestablishment of the rebel government.\r\n\r\n\"_Fourth_. All judges who have, since the rebellion, passed sentence\r\nof death against any of his majesty's liege subjects, for any supposed\r\nor real crime, committed or pretended to be committed against any law\r\nenacted or made by the Congress, or by any of the usurped or pretended\r\nlegislatures of the colonies, making the fact or facts criminal for\r\nwhich he, she, or they were condemned to suffer death.\r\n\r\n\"_Fifth_. All commissaries and others who have seized and sold the\r\nestates of any of his majesty's liege subjects, under any pretence\r\nwhatsoever, unless it was done by the consent and orders of the\r\nrightful owner, leaving all such to the mercy of his majesty, to be\r\ngranted to those only whose conduct merits mercy, and hold up the same\r\nin the proclamation, if any should issue.\r\n\r\n\"Will it not be proper as well as just to have the estates of the\r\nrebels who are gone out of the king's lines among the rebels\r\nforfeited, confiscated, and sold by commissioners to be appointed for\r\nthat purpose, and the moneys arising on the sales to be applied to the\r\nuse of the refugees, to compensate for their sufferings by the rebels\r\nin ease of the parliamentary donations? Will not the perfidy of France\r\nand Spain justify Great Britain in proposing and entering into an\r\nalliance with the courts of Russia, Prussia, and other powers, to\r\nunite against France and Spain, the common disturbers of public\r\ntranquillity; take and divide among them all their islands in the West\r\nIndies?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n1.

On the back of Mr. Sower's letter Mr. Galloway has made, in his own\r\nhandwriting, this endorsement--\"Mr. Sower is a German refugee at\r\nNew-York, and a person of the greatest influence among the Germans in\r\nPennsylvania.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe extracts which have been given from the correspondence of Mr.\r\nGalloway present, in a point of view sufficiently clear and distinct,\r\nthe unquestionable hostility of the tories towards the whigs; the\r\nmanner in which they wished the British ministry to conduct the\r\ncontest; the punishment they would have inflicted upon the rebels if\r\nthey had been successful, and the form in which they would have\r\nsubsequently governed the country. These views are deemed a sufficient\r\nreason for the feelings of the whigs; a justification of those\r\nlegislative disqualifications of the tories which were adopted by the\r\nState of New-York during the war of the revolution, and cause for the\r\npatriotic determination that the refugees should not be protected or\r\npermitted to remain in the land which they had so zealously struggled\r\nto enslave.\r\n\r\nAt a very early period after the declaration of Independence, parties\r\nwere formed among the whigs. In the State of New-York, at the first\r\nelection, in 1777, for governor under the new Constitution, General\r\nSchuyler was presented in opposition to George Clinton, but was\r\ndefeated. With that defeat it is believed commenced political\r\nheart-burnings and collisions which, although at times smothered, were\r\nnever extinguished. Schuyler was a man of great boldness and sagacity.\r\nHe was personally unpopular, yet he possessed a commanding influence\r\nover the mind of those with whom lie commingled or was in any manner\r\nconnected; an ascendancy which, in a measure, was to be ascribed to\r\nthe force of intellect.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of September, 1780, General Schuyler was a candidate for\r\nCongress. At that time the members were chosen by the legislature.\r\nEach house, viva voce, named a candidate. The two branches then met\r\ntogether and compared their nominations. If they both designated the\r\nsame individual, he was declared to be chosen. If not, they proceeded\r\nas one body to a ballot, and the person having a majority of all the\r\nvotes given was duly elected. The house almost unanimously nominated\r\nGeneral Schuyler, the vote being for Schuyler, thirty-one, for Ezra\r\nL'Hommidieu seven. The senate nominated L'Hommidieu. In joint ballot,\r\nnotwithstanding the vote Schuyler had received in the house,\r\nL'Hommidieu was chosen. For some reason not then explained, there was\r\na sudden and extraordinary change of opinion in the legislature in\r\nrelation to General Schuyler.\r\n\r\nAbout this period, certain individuals were for the appointment of a\r\n\"Supreme dictator, with all the powers conferred by the Roman people.\"\r\nA convention was to be held at Hartford, consisting of delegates from\r\nthe five New-England states and the state of New-York, for the\r\npurpose, among other objects, of devising more efficient measures for\r\nthe supply of the army. Judge Hobart, Egbert Benson, and General\r\nSchuyler were the delegates. \"It was for a contemplated by the\r\nlegislature to give them instructions to propose that a dictator\r\nshould be appointed, for which a majority in the more popular branch\r\nwere believed to be favourable. This 'mad project,' as Colonel\r\nAlexander Hamilton designated it, was communicated to him by General\r\nSchuyler in a letter of the 16th of September, 1780.\" [1]\r\n\r\nThe scheme was opposed with great ardour and perseverance by Governor\r\nGeorge Clinton, Ezra L'Hommidieu, and others; but, through the\r\ninfluence of the former, in a great measure, the \"mad project\" was\r\ndefeated. Here again the party lines were drawn between Governor\r\nClinton and General Schuyler. It is highly probable that the plan for\r\nappointing a \"supreme dictator\" was a principal cause for the change\r\nof opinion respecting General Schuyler in the legislature on the 12th\r\nof September, and contributed to defeat his election to Congress.\r\n\r\nFrom this period until the adoption of the Federal Constitution, the\r\nClinton and the Schuyler parties continued to exist. In the ranks of\r\nthe latter there was great concert in action. On an examination of the\r\nlegislative journals from 1777 to 1788, it will be seen, that with\r\nGeneral Schuyler were the Jays, the Livingstons, the Van Rensellaers,\r\nand the Bensons, and that they almost uniformly voted together.\r\n\r\nAnd now of the tories. In the year 1779 some of them, who had removed\r\nfrom Albany within the British lines, petitioned the legislature for\r\nleave to return, which petition was rejected. At the same session an\r\nact was passed requiring all counsellors and attorneys, before they\r\ncould be permitted to practice in any court, to produce evidence of\r\ntheir attachment to the liberty and independence of the United States.\r\nOn the 20th of November, 1781, a special act was passed on the same\r\nsubject, confirmatory of what bad been done in 1779.\r\n\r\nThe first session of the legislature after the revolutionary war was\r\nheld in the city of New-York. It was convened by proclamation of the\r\ngovernor on the 6th of January, 1784, and continued its sitting until\r\nthe 12th of May following. In the first month of the session, numerous\r\npetitions were presented by the tories, praying to be relieved from\r\ntheir banishment, and to be permitted a residence within the state.\r\nThe legislature perceived that, if they did not act promptly, their\r\ntables would be covered with these memorials. Therefore, in the\r\nlanguage of Governor Clinton at the opening of the session, the\r\nassembly said--\r\n\r\n\"While we recollect the general progress of a war which has been\r\nmarked with cruelty and rapine; while we survey the ruins of this once\r\nflourishing city and its vicinity; while we sympathize in the\r\ncalamities which have reduced so many of our virtuous fellow-citizens\r\nto want and distress, and are anxiously solicitous for means to repair\r\nthe wastes and misfortunes which we lament,\" we cannot hearken to\r\nthese petitions. They were referred to a select committee, which\r\ncommittee in a few days reported against granting their prayer, and\r\nthe house instantly, without a division, agreed to the report. This\r\nwas on the 9th of February, 1784.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of February, 1784, the assembly passed a resolution\r\ndirecting that the names of those persons that had been attainted\r\nshould be communicated to the governors of the several states;\r\nrequesting to be supplied, in like manner, with \"a list of the persons\r\nproscribed or banished by their respective states, in order that\r\nthereby the _principles of federal union_ may be adhered to and\r\npreserved.\" In the senate this resolution was permitted to sleep.\r\n\r\nChancellor Robert R. Livingston, in a letter to John Jay dated the\r\n25th of January, 1784, thus speaks of parties at this period. \"Our\r\nparties are, first, the tories, who still hope for power, under the\r\nidea that the remembrance of the past should be lost, though they\r\ndaily keep it up by their avowed attachment to Great Britain;\r\nsecondly, the violent whigs, who are for expelling all tories from the\r\nstate, in hopes, by that means, to preserve the power in their own\r\nhands. The third are those who wish to suppress all violence, to\r\nsoften the rigour of the laws against the loyalists, and not to banish\r\nthem from that social intercourse which may, by degrees, obliterate\r\nthe remembrance of past misdeeds.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of March, 1784, Peter Yates and three hundred others\r\npetitioned the legislature to prevent those persons who had joined or\r\nremained with the enemy during the late war from returning, and to\r\nprohibit such as have remained from being eligible to any office of\r\nprofit or trust. On the 31st of the same month strong resolutions were\r\nintroduced into the house, and adopted by both branches, against the\r\ntories, declaring, among other things, \"That as, on the one hand, the\r\nrules of justice do not require, so, on the other, the public\r\ntranquility will not permit, that such adherents who have been\r\nattainted should be restored to the rights of citizenship.\"\r\n\r\nIn May, 1784, the legislature passed an act entitled \"An act to,\r\npreserve the freedom and independence of this state, and for other\r\npurposes.\" The object of this law was to prohibit the tories from\r\nholding any office. The Council of Revision returned the bill, with\r\nobjections to its passage, one of which was, \"that so large a portion\r\nof the citizens remained in parts of the _Southern District_ which\r\nwere possessed by the British armies, that in most places it would be\r\ndifficult, and in many _absolutely impossible_, to find men to fill\r\nthe necessary offices, even for _conducting_ elections, until a new\r\nset of inhabitants could be procured.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill of disfranchisement, notwithstanding the objections of the\r\nCouncil of Revision, was passed by more than two thirds of both\r\nbranches, and thus became a law. Such were the feelings of the\r\n\"violent whigs;\" such the policy of the first legislature after the\r\ntermination of the war. But, unfortunately, among those who had fought\r\nthe battles of the revolution, there were some who doubted the\r\ncapacity of the people for self-government, while there were others\r\nwho sought power and influence at the hazard of principle. The\r\nSchuyler party were in the minority. The Clinton party, designated by\r\nChancellor Livingston as the \"violent whigs,\" were uncompromising on\r\nthe question of banishing the tories, who were numerous, especially in\r\nthe Southern District. It seemed probable, therefore, if restored to\r\ncitizenship, that they would amalgamate with the _third_ party, or\r\nthat class of whigs \"who wished to suppress all violence, and to\r\nsoften the rigour of the laws against the royalists.\"\r\n\r\nIn March, 1783, the legislature passed an act entitled \"An act for\r\ngranting more effectual relief in cases of trespass.\" The object of\r\nthis act was to enable the whigs at the termination of the war to\r\nrecover from the tories rent for any landed estate they might have\r\noccupied; and in cases of suit for such rent, the act declares \"that\r\nno defendant or defendants shall be admitted to plead in justification\r\nany military order or command whatsoever for such occupancy.\"\r\n\r\nUnder this statute an action was commenced by Mrs. Rutgers against Mr.\r\nWaddington, in the Mayor's Court of the City of New-York, for the\r\nrecovery of rent for the occupancy of a brewhouse and malthouse, the\r\nproperty of the said Mrs. Rutgers. The cause was argued on the 29th of\r\nJune, 1784, James Duane as Mayor, and Richard Varick as Recorder,\r\npresiding. On the 27th of August the court gave judgment \"that the\r\nplea of the defendant was good for so much of the time as he held\r\nunder the British commander-in-chief; because, in the opinion of the\r\ncourt, a liberal construction of the law of nations would make it so.\"\r\nAs this decision involved a great principle, and would materially\r\naffect the whigs whose property had been occupied by the tories during\r\nthe war, it produced great excitement.\r\n\r\nA meeting of the whigs was convened on the 13th of September, 1784. A\r\ncommittee was appointed, and an address to the people of the state\r\nprepared and published by them. That committee consisted of Melancton\r\nSmith, Peter Ricker, Jonathan Lawrence, Anthony Rutgers, Peter T.\r\nCurtenius, Thomas Tucker, Daniel Shaw, Adam Gilchrist, Junr., and John\r\nWiley. Of this committee Melancton Smith was the life and soul. He was\r\nthe author of the address--a clear, able, and unanswerable exposition\r\nof the case. It states the determination of Mrs. Rutgers to carry it\r\nup to the Supreme Court, and, if defeated there, to the Senate, which,\r\nwith the judges of the Supreme Court, constituted the Court for the\r\nCorrection of Errors. Having reference to the contemplated\r\nproceedings, the address closes as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Preparatory to such an event, we exhort you to be cautious, in your\r\nfuture choice of senators, that none be elected but those on whom,\r\nfrom long and certain experience, you can rely as men attached to the\r\nliberty of America, and firm friends to our laws and constitution; men\r\nwho will spurn at any proposition that has a tendency to curtail the\r\nprivileges of the people, and who, at the same time that they protect\r\nus against _judicial tyranny_, have wisdom to see the propriety of\r\nsupporting that necessary independence in courts of justice, both of\r\nthe legislature and people.\r\n\r\n\"Having confined ourselves to constitutional measures, and now\r\nsolemnly declaring our disapprobation of all others, we feel a freedom\r\nin sounding the alarm to our fellow-citizens. If that independence,\r\nwhich we have obtained at a risk which makes the acquisition little\r\nless than miraculous, was worth contending for against a powerful and\r\nenraged monarch, and at the expense of the best blood in America,\r\nsurely its preservation is worth contending for against those _among\r\nourselves who might impiously hope to build their greatness upon the\r\nruins of that fabric which was so dearly established_.\r\n\r\n\"That the principle of decision in the case of Rutgers _vs_.\r\nWaddington is dangerous to the freedom of our government, and that a\r\nperseverance in that principle would leave our legislature nothing but\r\na name, and render their sessions nothing more than an expensive form\r\nof government, the preceding remarks must evidence.\r\n\r\n\"Permit us, on this occasion, earnestly to entreat you to join us in\r\nwatchfulness against every attempt that may be used, either violently\r\nand suddenly, or _gently_ and _imperceptibly, to effect a revolution_\r\nin the _spirit_ and _genius_ of our government; and _should there be\r\namong us characters to whom the simplicity of it is offensive_, let\r\nour attention and perseverance be such as to _preclude the hopes of a\r\nchange_.\"\r\n\r\nHere again the party lines of 1777 are distinctly marked. Melancton\r\nSmith, Jonathan Lawrence, &c., were of the Clinton party, while Mr.\r\nDuane and Mr. Varick were attached to the Schuyler interest.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1784, the case of Rutgers _vs_. Waddington was brought\r\nbefore the legislature, and on the 27th of that month the assembly\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That this adjudication is subversive of all law and good\r\norder; because, if a court instituted for the _benefit and government\r\nof a corporation_ may take upon themselves to dispense with a law of\r\nthe state, all other courts may do the like: therefore,\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That it be recommended to the honourable the Council of\r\nAppointment, at their next session, to appoint such persons to be\r\nmayor and recorder of the city of New-York as will govern themselves\r\nby the known laws of the land.\r\n\r\nSubsequently Waddington compromised the claim against him; but the law\r\nin similar cases became operative, and remained so until its repeal by\r\nthe legislature. In the following session, March, 1785, an\r\nunsuccessful attempt was made to repeal the act of 1781, disqualifying\r\ntory counsellors and attorneys; some modification, however, of other\r\nlaws of a similar character was effected. In April, 1786, the\r\nrepealing act passed; and the restriction on the tory lawyers being\r\nremoved, they were permitted to practise in the several courts of the\r\nstate. During the same month, \"an act for the payment of certain sums\r\nof money\" was amended by adding a clause, \"restoring to the rights of\r\ncitizenship, on taking the oath of abjuration and allegiance,\" all\r\nsuch persons as had been disfranchised by the third clause of the act\r\nentitled \"An act to preserve the freedom and independence of this\r\nstate,\" passed the 12th of May, 1784. During this session the Schuyler\r\nparty had the ascendence, and on all questions having a political\r\naspect the names of Alexander Hamilton, Richard Varick, C. Livingston,\r\nNicholas Bayard, David Brooks, James Livingston, &c., will be found on\r\nthe same side.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of March, 1787, Mr. Hamilton asked leave, which was\r\ngranted, to bring in a bill to repeal the act entitled \"An act for\r\ngranting relief in case of certain trespasses.\" This was the act under\r\nwhich the suit had been commenced against Waddington, and which case\r\nproduced so much excitement in the summer and autumn of 1784. Mr.\r\nHamilton's bill passed; but, lest there should be some forgotten\r\nstatute that might restrict or limit the political privileges of the\r\ntories, it was deemed expedient, on the 13th of April, to introduce\r\nand pass an act under the imposing title of \"An act to repeal all laws\r\nof this state inconsistent with the treaty of peace.\" As its\r\nprovisions met every possible case, the tories were now placed on a\r\nfooting with the whigs. All they wanted was leaders. The rank and file\r\nthey already possessed.\r\n\r\nThe Schuyler party sought allies. The tories were numerous, especially\r\nin the Southern District. The Clinton party, designated by Chancellor\r\nLivingston, in his letter to John Jay, as the \"_violent whigs_,\" were\r\nuncompromising on the question of banishing the tories from the state.\r\nIt seemed probable, therefore, that, sooner or later, if restored to\r\ncitizenship, they would amalgamate with that class of whigs who wished\r\nto suppress \"all violence, and to soften the rigour of the laws\r\nagainst the royalists.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect of these legislative measures on the tories was anticipated\r\nby both friends and foes. Chancellor Livingston, in January, 1784, had\r\nsaid that there were three parties in the state:--\r\n\r\n_First_. The tories.\r\n\r\n_Second_. The violent whigs.\r\n\r\n_Third_. Those who wished \" to soften the rigour of the laws against\r\nthe royalists.\"\r\n\r\nThe Council of Revision, composed of Robert R. Livingston, Justice\r\nMorris, and Judge Hobart, had solemnly placed on record their opinion,\r\nthat, in some portions of the Southern District \"it would be\r\ndifficult, and in many _absolutely impossible_, to find whigs to fill\r\nthe necessary offices even for _conducting_ elections.\" Under such\r\ncircumstances it was evident that the _first_ and _third_ parties must\r\namalgamate, and such was the result.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1788, the legislature met, and directed the call of a\r\nState Convention, to whom was to be submitted the Federal\r\nConstitution, as adopted by the General Convention held in\r\nPhiladelphia in May, 1787. During this session the same party lines\r\ncontinued to be visible, although the respective parties had now\r\nassumed, or were designated by new names. The Schuyler was called the\r\nFederal party, and the Clinton the anti-Federal party; thev were\r\ncomposed, however, of the same individuals, with very few exceptions.\r\nThe great, and almost the only strength which the federal party\r\npossessed in the state was in the Southern District. Here the\r\nacquisition of the tories rendered their power and influence\r\nirresistible. From this district, composed of the counties of\r\nWestchester, New-York, Richmond, King's, Queen's, and Suffolk, the\r\nfederalists had in the Assembly, during the session of 1788-89,\r\n_twenty_ votes, and on no _party_ question did they command, during\r\nthe whole session, more than _twenty-three_ votes.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1788, a bill for carrying into operation the federal\r\nconstitution being under consideration, a proposition was made to\r\nchoose United States senators; but the federalists having a majority\r\nin the Senate, and the anti-federalists a majority in the House of\r\nAssembly, no compromise between the parties could be effected, and\r\nconsequently no senators were chosen.\r\n\r\nThe following persons may be considered as constituting the strength\r\nof the Schuyler, now federal party, in the assembly of 1788-89:--\r\n\r\nBrockholst Livingston, of the city of New-York. William W. Gilbert, \"\r\n\" Alexander Macomb, \" \" Richard Harrison, \" \" Nicholas Hoffman, \" \"\r\nJohn Watts, Jun., \" \" Nicholas Low, \" \" Gulian Verplanck, \" \" Comfort\r\nSands, \" \" Philip Van Cortlandt, Westchester county. Philip\r\nLivingston, \" \" Nathaniel Rockwell, \" \" Walter Seaman, \" \" Jonathan\r\nHorton, \" \" John Younglove, Albany county. Henry K. Van Rensellaer, \"\r\n\" Stephen Carman, Queen's county. Whitehead Cornwell, \" \" Peter\r\nVandervoort, King's county. Aquilla Giles, \" \" Abraham Bancker,\r\nRichmond county. John C. Dongan, \" \" Samuel A. Barker, Dutchess\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed, that all the above Schuyler or federal members,\r\nwith the exception of _two_ from Albany and _one_ from Dutchess\r\ncounty, were elected as representatives from the Southern District.\r\n\r\nHaving stated the origin and progress of the great political parties\r\nin the State of New-York, as they appear from the public records, it\r\nmay be proper to add that Colonel Burr belonged to what was termed by\r\nMr. Livingston \"the violent whig party.\" By that party, while the\r\ntories were disfranchised, Mr. Burr was elected in 1784 to represent\r\nthe city and county of New-York in the legislature. By that party, in\r\n1789, he was appointed attorney-general of the state. By that party,\r\nin 1791, he was appointed a senator of the United States. By that\r\nparty, in 1792, he was appointed a judge of the Supreme Court. By that\r\nparty, subsequently, he was elected a member of the Assembly and a\r\nmember of the Convention to revise the Constitution of the State, of\r\nwhich convention he was president; and by that party, in 1800, he was\r\nelected vice-president of the United States.\r\n\r\nIt is not intended to discuss the policy, the humanity, or the justice\r\nof the several measures proposed or adopted in relation to the tories\r\nby \"_the violent whigs_,\" or by those whigs who wished \"_to soften the\r\nrigour of the laws against the loyalists_.\" The historical facts have\r\nbeen given, and the sources from whence they were derived specified.\r\nThe feelings and opinions of \"_the violent whigs_,\" are expressed by\r\nthe legislature of the state on the 9th of February, 1784, and by\r\nGovernor George Clinton at the opening of that session in the city of\r\nNew-York. They say--\" While we recollect the general progress of a war\r\nwhich has been marked with cruelty and rapine; while we survey the\r\nruins of this once flourishing city and its vicinity; while we\r\nsympathize in the calamities which have reduced so many of our\r\nvirtuous fellow-citizens to want and distress, and are anxiously\r\nsolicitous for means to repair the wastes and misfortunes which we\r\nlament, we cannot hearken to these petitions.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the sentiments and views of those whigs who wished\r\n\"_to soften the rigour of the laws against the loyalists_\" are to be\r\nfound in the following extracts of letters.\r\n\r\nJOHN JAY TO GOVERNOR WILLIAM LIVINGSTON. [2]\r\n\r\n\"Passay, 9th April, 1783.\r\n\r\n\"The tories will doubtless cause some difficulty; but that they have\r\nalways done; and as this will probably be the _last time_, we must\r\nmake the best of it. A universal, indiscriminate condemnation and\r\nexpulsion of those people would not redound to our honour, because so\r\nharsh a measure would partake more of vengeance than of justice. For\r\nmy part, I wish that all, except _the faithless and cruel_, may be\r\nforgiven. That exception would indeed _extend to very few_; but even\r\nif it applied to the case of one only, that one ought, in my opinion,\r\nto be saved.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN JAY TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON.\r\n\r\n\"Passay, 12th September, 1783.\r\n\r\n\"Europe hears much, and wishes to hear more of divisions, seditions,\r\nviolences, and confusions among us. The tories are generally and\r\ngreatly pitied; _more, indeed, than they deserve_. The indiscriminate\r\nexpulsion and ruin of that whole class and description of men would\r\nnot do honour to our magnanimity or humanity, especially in the\r\nopinion of those nations who consider, with more astonishment than\r\npleasure, the terms of peace which America has obtained.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n1. See Life of Hamilton, Vol. I., p. 316\r\n\r\n2. Jay's Works, Vol. I., p. 128.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been seen that the Livingstons were of the Schuyler party\r\nduring the revolutionary war, and that they continued so until the\r\nyear 1787, when, in common with their political friends, they were the\r\nwarm and ardent champions of the Federal Constitution. After its\r\nadoption, and the organization of the government under it, they soon\r\nbecame dissatisfied. The cause of that dissatisfaction has been\r\ndifferently explained. On the one hand it was said that they were\r\nalarmed at the doctrines of those who had been called to administer\r\nthe government, and at the assumption of powers not delegated by the\r\npeople. That they apprehended the government was verging towards a\r\n_consolidated national_, instead of a _federal_ government of states.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand it was alleged that the family were disappointed and\r\ndisgusted at the neglect which they experienced from General\r\nWashington. That, as Robert R. Livingston had been, in the state\r\nconvention which adopted the Constitution, one of its most splendid\r\nand efficient supporters, he and his connexions anticipated his\r\nappointment to some exalted station; but that, while he was passed by\r\nunnoticed, his colleagues in that body, John Jay and Alexander\r\nHamilton, had both received distinguished appointments--the one as\r\nChief Justice of the United States, and the other as Secretary of the\r\nTreasury. Whatever may have been the cause of this change, it is\r\ncertain that they soon abandoned the federal, and united their\r\npolitical destiny with the anti-federal party. Although these\r\ngentlemen, as politicians, were acting in concert with Mr. Burr, yet\r\nthere was no cordiality of feeling between them. In their social\r\nintercourse, however, the most perfect comity was observed; and as\r\nthey were in a minority, struggling to break down a party haughty,\r\nproscriptive, and intolerant beyond any thing that the American people\r\nhad beheld, they zealously united their efforts in effecting the\r\nrevolution of 1800.\r\n\r\nSoon after the adoption of the new constitution, the anti-federal\r\nparty were recognised by a name more descriptive of their principles\r\nand their views. They assumed the title of democrats. They considered\r\nthemselves anti-consolidationists, but not anti-federalists. They knew\r\nthat a section of the dominant party were the friends of a splendid\r\nnational government. That they were the advocates of a system, by\r\nmeans of which all power would have concentrated in the general, and\r\nthe state governments been reduced to the level of mere corporations.\r\nAgainst this system the democrats reasoned and contended with unabated\r\nzeal. They were the early, unflinching, and faithful champions of\r\nstate rights_.\r\n\r\nFrom the year 1790 until 1800, the democratic and federal parties were\r\nalternately triumphant, both in the city and in the state of New-York.\r\nIn the former, the result of an election was frequently decided by the\r\noperations of some local or exciting topic. No decisive contest took\r\nplace between the parties previous to 1800, founded on any great or\r\ncontrolling principle of government. But, during the years 1798 and\r\n1799, the whole country was agitated from one extreme to the other.\r\nRevolutionary France was convulsed, and, in the midst of her\r\nconvulsions and sufferings, was daily committing the most cruel and\r\nwanton excesses towards her own citizens, while she was offering\r\ntaunts and insults to foreign nations. The federal party seemed to\r\nsigh for a war with France. Pretending that they apprehended a French\r\ninvasion, a large standing army was raised. At the head of this army,\r\nsecond in command to General Washington, was placed General Alexander\r\nHamilton. To support the army and other useless extravagant\r\nexpenditures, a land tax and an _eight per cent._ loan was found\r\nnecessary. To silence the murmurs of an oppressed people, a sedition\r\nlaw was enacted. Such were some of the fruits of the elder Mr. Adams's\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1799 and the winter of 1799-1800, the interesting and\r\nvital question was presented to the American nation:--Will you sustain\r\nthis administration and these measures, and thus rivet chains upon\r\nyourselves and your posterity? Or will you calmly, but firmly and in\r\nunion, resort to the constitutional remedy (the ballot-boxes) for\r\nrelief from wrongs and oppressions which, if permitted to endure, must\r\nterminate in the horrors of intestine war? Here was a question of\r\nprinciple; and, it is believed, a question which was to decide the\r\ncharacter of the government. Each party felt that it was a mighty\r\nstruggle, decisive of its future political influence, if not of its\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nThe elections in the state of New-York were held in the month of\r\nApril. In the year 1799 the federalists had a majority in the city of\r\nmore than nine hundred. During the summer, it was universally conceded\r\nthat on the state of New-York the presidential election would depend,\r\nand that the result in the city would decide the fate of the state.\r\nThat this opinion was as universal as it was true, cannot be more\r\ndistinctly exhibited than by the following extract of a letter from\r\nMr. Jefferson to Mr. Madison, dated 4th March, 1800.\r\n\r\n\"In New-York all depends on the success of the city election, which is\r\nof twelve members, and of course makes a difference of twenty-four,\r\nwhich is sufficient to make the two houses, joined together,\r\nrepublican in their vote. * * * * * * Upon the whole, I consider it as\r\nrather more doubtful than the last election (1796), in which I was not\r\ndeceived in more than a vote or two. * * * * * * In any event, we may\r\nsay, that if the city election of New-York is in favour of the\r\nrepublican ticket, the issue will be republican; if the federal ticket\r\nfor the city of New-York prevails, the probabilities will be in favour\r\nof a federal issue, because it would then require a republican vote\r\nboth from New-Jersey and Pennsylvania to preponderate against\r\nNew-York, on which we could not count with any confidence.\"\r\n\r\nReference has been made to the conflicting factions of which the\r\ndemocratic party was now composed. The Clinton section, the Livingston\r\nsection, and the Burr section. The first and last were apparently the\r\nsame, but not so in reality. Colonel Burr's commanding talents had\r\nacquired for him an influence in the ranks of the democratic party in\r\nother states, which created some jealousy in the Clinton family, the\r\nyounger and collateral branches of which were extremely hostile to\r\nhim. The ambition of Burr, sustained by a daring spirit and\r\nunconquerable perseverance, awakened the apprehensions of Governor\r\nGeorge Clinton lest he should be supplanted. The governor was a man of\r\ngreat sagacity and shrewdness. But these two sections, or, perhaps,\r\nmore properly, the heads of them, united in their opposition to the\r\nLivingstons.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1800, the efforts of Colonel Burr to bring about\r\na concert in action of these discordant materials were unceasing. With\r\nhis own personal friends he had no difficulty, for it was ever one of\r\nhis characteristics to secure inviolable the attachment of his\r\nfriends. They were of the most ardent and devoted kind. Confiding in\r\nhis patriotism and judgment, and feeling that he was incapable of\r\ndeceiving them, they seemed willing, at all times and under all\r\ncircumstances, to hazard their lives and fortunes in his support. They\r\nwere generally young men of gallant bearing and disinterested views.\r\nNo sordid calculations were made by them. No mercenary considerations\r\ninfluenced their conduct. They beheld in Colonel Burr a patriot hero\r\nof the revolution, who had commingled with their fathers in the\r\nbattle-field, and who had perilled every thing in his country's cause.\r\nSuch were his friends, and such their zeal in his behalf. It was here\r\nthat Colonel Burr was all-powerful, for he possessed, in a pre-eminent\r\ndegree, the art of fascinating the youthful. But with all this tact\r\nand talent, he was credulous and easily deceived. He therefore often\r\nbecame the dupe of the most worthless and unprincipled.\r\n\r\nMr. Burr held frequent private meetings with his most intimate and\r\nconfidential friends. At all these meetings it is believed the success\r\nof the democratic party was the only question under consideration. No\r\nlocal or personal interests were permitted to be discussed. The\r\ntriumph of the party, as a whole, was the great object. By his\r\nadherents, it was deemed indispensable that he should be a member of\r\nthe legislature to be chosen in April, which body was to appoint the\r\npresidential electors. While, on the other hand, it was considered not\r\nless necessary that he should be free to act at the polls in the city\r\nof New-York during the election. How was this to be effected? After\r\nmuch conference and deliberation it was resolved that he should be\r\nelected from Orange county, if the arrangement could be made, and the\r\nexecution of the plan was intrusted principally to Peter Townsend,\r\nEsquire, of Chester, who, with the aid of other influential friends,\r\naccomplished it.\r\n\r\nThe next question was, Of whom shall the assembly ticket for the city\r\nbe composed? On the suggestion of Colonel Burr, the names of certain\r\ndistinguished individuals, venerable in years, and respected for their\r\nservices, for months before the election were put in circulation as\r\ncandidates; and, among others, Governor George Clinton and General\r\nHoratio Gates. At length the nominating committees were chosen; but so\r\ngeneral had been the conversations as to suitable candidates, that\r\nvery little diversity of opinion prevailed in the formation of the\r\nticket.\r\n\r\nThe following persons were nominated: George Clinton, Horatio Gates,\r\nSamuel Osgood, Henry Rutgers, Elias Nexsen, Thomas Storm, George\r\nWarner, Philip I. Arcularius, James Hunt, Ezekiel Robins, Brockholst\r\nLivingston, and John Swartwout.\r\n\r\nIn this ticket the three sections of the democratic, but at this\r\nelection designated the _republican party,_ are fully represented.\r\nGovernor Clinton at the head of one section, Brockholst Livingston\r\nrepresenting another, and General Gates, well known to be the personal\r\nand political friend of Colonel Burr. This ticket being nominated by\r\nthe committee, the difficulty was to procure their consent to stand as\r\ncandidates. A majority of them had no expectation of success. They\r\nconsidered the contest as a forlorn hope, and shrank from being set up\r\nas targets to be shot at. Governor Clinton, General Gates, Brockholst\r\nLivingston, and others, had repeatedly declared their fixed\r\ndetermination not to permit their names to be used.\r\n\r\nA sub-committee was appointed to wait upon the candidates, and obtain\r\npermission to present their names for approval to a general meeting of\r\ncitizens to be convened for that purpose. The sub-committee consisted\r\nof Aaron Burr, David Gelston, John Swartwout, John Mills, and Matthew\r\nL. Davis. After various communications and much persuasion, _nine_ of\r\nthe candidates consented, some of them conditionally. But Governor\r\nClinton, General Gates, and Brockholst Livingston were for a time\r\nimmoveable. At length Colonel Burr induced Judge Livingston to agree\r\nthat he would serve, if Governor Clinton and General Gates consented\r\nto serve. The sub-committee next waited upon General Gates, and\r\nColonel Burr appealed to him in the most mild and persuasive language.\r\nAfter much importunity he yielded, provided Governor Clinton was also\r\na candidate.\r\n\r\nNo terms can give a correct idea of the scenes between Governor\r\nClinton and the sub-committee, for they had an interview with him on\r\nthree different days. The last was at the house of Colonel Burr, where\r\nMr. Clinton met the committee by appointment. He never did consent to\r\nstand, but pledged himself to Colonel Burr and the committee that he\r\nwould publish nothing in the newspapers, reserving to himself the\r\nright (which he subsequently exercised) of stating in conversation\r\nthat his name was used without his authority or permission. Thus it is\r\nevident, that but for the matchless perseverance of Colonel Burr, the\r\nticket, as it stood, never could have been formed, and, when formed,\r\nwould have been broken up, and the republican party discomfited and\r\nbeaten.\r\n\r\nAn imperfect sketch of the scene at the house of Colonel Burr was\r\npublished in the year 1802, in a pamphlet under the signature of\r\n_Aristides_. The following is extracted from it. The note of reference\r\nhere given is also extracted. Its correctness was never publicly\r\ndenied by either of the gentlemen named. There exists no longer any\r\nreason for concealment on the subject; and it is therefore now\r\nadmitted that this _note_ was written from memorandums made at the\r\ntime by the author of this volume.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT,\r\n\r\n\"Governor Clinton, however, remained unmoved by the most earnest\r\nsolicitations; and, with matchless firmness, resisted the arguments of\r\nMr. Burr, who forcibly asserted that it was a right inherent in the\r\ncommunity to command the services of an individual when the nature of\r\npublic exigences seemed to require it. He was inflexible to the last,\r\nand then was nominated and elected without a distinct expression of\r\nhis approbation. Justice, however, induces me to acknowledge, that the\r\nreasons he assigned for the reluctance with which he acted were\r\nplausible and potent.\r\n\r\n\"He explicitly declared that he had long entertained an unfavourable\r\nopinion of Mr. Jefferson's talents as a statesman and his firmness as\r\na republican. That he conceived him an accommodating trimmer, who\r\nwould change with times, and bend to circumstances for the purposes of\r\npersonal promotion. Impressed with these sentiments, he could not,\r\nwith propriety, he said, acquiesce in the elevation of a man destitute\r\nof the qualifications essential to the good administration of the\r\ngovernment; and added other expressions too vulgar to be here\r\nrepeated. 'But,' said he, with energy, 'if you, Mr. Burr, was the\r\ncandidate for the presidential chair, I would act with pleasure and\r\nwith vigour.'\"\r\n\r\nIt is so notorious that these were Governor Clinton's sentiments, that\r\nit is scarcely necessary to produce authority to prove it. To remove,\r\nhowever, every doubt in the reader's mind, I will refer him to Mr.\r\nDavid Gelston, Mr. John Mills, Mr. John Swartwout, or Mr. Matthew L.\r\nDavis, in whose presence these sentiments, and many others more\r\ndisrespectful, if possible, were uttered. It was at the house of Mr.\r\nBurr, who, anticipating the evil consequences that at that critical\r\nmoment would result from such conduct in Governor Clinton, insisted,\r\nbefore he left the house, that he should promise his friends to desist\r\nfrom using such language previous to or during the election. This was\r\nvery reluctantly complied with on the part of Mr. Clinton.\r\n\r\n\"Notwithstanding this, they were continually reiterated by his son,\r\nwho publicly and loudly animadverted upon the character of Mr.\r\nJefferson with the most vulgar severity. Similar sentiments were\r\ncertainly entertained by all Governor Clinton's connexions, as their\r\nconduct during the election clearly evinced. Mr. Dewitt Clinton,\r\nthrough the whole contest, never appeared at the poll, but observed\r\nthe most shameful indfference and inactivity.\"\r\n\r\nThe nomination of a ticket having been made and approved at a public\r\nmeeting over which Anthony Lispenard presided, its effect upon both\r\nparties was tremendous. The character and standing of the candidates\r\nseemed a presage of victory. It elated, and gave life and vigour to\r\nthe republicans, while it paralyzed and depressed the federalists.\r\n\r\nNever before or since has a ticket been presented to the citizens of\r\nNew-York composed of men combining such talents, patriotism,\r\nexperience, and public services, as the republican assembly ticket for\r\nthe year 1800.\r\n\r\nThose who possess a knowledge of the character of Colonel Burr know\r\nwhat were his qualifications for execution. The plan of the campaign\r\nhaving been opened, it only remained to be executed. In the\r\nperformance of this duty, all Mr. Burr's industry, perseverance, and\r\nenergy were called into operation. Nor were the federal party idle or\r\ninactive. They possessed wealth and patronage. Led on to the contest\r\nby their talented chieftain, General Hamilton, whose influence in\r\ntheir ranks was unbounded, they made a desperate but ineffectual\r\nresistance to the assaults upon their political citadel. If defeated\r\nhere, their power was gone, and the administration of the government\r\nlost. Both General Hamilton and Colonel Burr exerted themselves\r\npersonally at the polls during the three days of election. They\r\nrepeatedly addressed the people, and did all that men could do. They\r\nfrequently met at the same polls, and argued, in the presence of large\r\nassemblages, the debatable questions. Their deportment towards each\r\nother and towards their opponents was such as comported with the\r\ndignity of two of the most accomplished and courtly gentlemen of the\r\nage in which they lived.\r\n\r\nThe polls of the election opened on the morning of the 29th of April,\r\nand finally closed at sunset on the 1st of May. Immediately after, the\r\ninspectors commenced counting and canvassing the ballots. Sufficient\r\nprogress was made during the night to render it, in a great measure,\r\ncertain that the republican ticket had succeeded; and on the 2d of May\r\nthis result was announced, the average majority being about 490. All\r\ndoubt as to the presidential vote of the state of New-York was now\r\nremoved, unless the federal party, in their expiring agonies, could\r\ndevise some plan by which the will of the people, thus clearly\r\nexpressed, should be defeated. Such apprehensions were entertained,\r\nand, it was soon discovered, not entertained without good reason.\r\n\r\nIn both branches of the legislature elected in 1799 the federalists\r\nhad a majority. The time of service of the members would expire on the\r\n1st of July, 1800. After the nomination of the republican assembly\r\nticket, but previous to the election in April, 1800, it was suspected\r\nthat certain federalists had in contemplation a project to render the\r\ncity election null and void if the republicans succeeded. When the\r\npolls were closed, therefore, discreet and intelligent men were placed\r\nat them to guard, if it should be found necessary, the inspectors from\r\ncommitting, inadvertently, any errors, either in canvassing or making\r\ntheir returns. Every movement, subsequently, of leading federal\r\ngentlemen was narrowly and cautiously watched. The result of the\r\nelection was announced on the 2d of May. On the 3d of May, in the\r\nevening, a select and confidential federal caucus was held. On the 4th\r\na letter was written to William Duane, editor of the Aurora, stating\r\nthat such a caucus had been held the preceding night, and that it was\r\ndetermined by the caucus to solicit Governor Jay to convene the\r\nexisting legislature forthwith, for the purpose of changing the mode\r\nof choosing electors for president, and placing it in the hands of the\r\npeople by districts. The effect of such a measure would have been to\r\nneutralize the State of New-York, and, as the result finally proved,\r\nwould have secured to the federal party their president and\r\nvice-president. This letter was published in the Aurora of the 6th of\r\nMay, and called forth the denunciations of those federal papers whose\r\nconductors were not in the secret. The author of the letter was\r\nassailed as a _Jacobin_ calumniator, and the whole story was\r\npronounced a vile fabrication. One of the New-York city papers\r\nreprinted the letter, and thus closes its commentary on it:--\"Where is\r\nthe American who _will not detest the author of this infamous lie_? If\r\nthere is a man to be found who will sanction this publication, he is\r\nworse than the worst of Jacobins!\"\r\n\r\nWhat effect, if any, was produced by this immediate exposure of the\r\ncaucus proceedings, it is not necessary now to inquire. It is\r\nsufficient to say that the development was, in all its parts,\r\nliterally correct, and the subject is here introduced for the twofold\r\npurpose of showing, _first_, the vigilance, promptitude, and\r\narrangement of the republican party of that day; and, _second_, the\r\nmeans to which certain desperate federalists were willing to resort\r\nfor the purpose of retaining power. That the representations contained\r\nin the publication of the Aurora were strictly true, is now matter of\r\nrecorded history.\r\n\r\nIn the life of John Jay, vol. i., p. 412, the letter addressed to the\r\ngovernor on this subject is published. It bears date _one day_ after\r\nthe publication in the Aurora, but before the paper reached the city\r\nof New-York. The author of the work, after some preliminary remarks,\r\nSays--\"These details will explain the proposal made in the following\r\nletter, which was received by the governor _from one of the most\r\ndistinguished federalists in the United States_.\" [1]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nNew-York May 7, 1800.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nYou have been informed of the loss of our election in this city. It is\r\nalso known that we have been unfortunate throughout Long Island and in\r\nWestchester. According to the returns hitherto, it is too probable\r\nthat we lose our senator for this district.\r\n\r\nThe moral certainty, therefore, is, that there will be an anti-federal\r\nmajority in the ensuing legislature; and the very high probability is,\r\nthat this will bring Jefferson into the chief magistracy, unless it be\r\nprevented by the measure which I shall now submit to your\r\nconsideration; namely, the immediate calling together of the existing\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\nI am aware that there are weighty objections to the measure; but the\r\nreasons for it appear to me to outweigh the objections; and, in times\r\nlike these in which we live, it will not do to be over scrupulous. It\r\nis easy to sacrifice the substantial interests of society by a strict\r\nadherence to ordinary rules.\r\n\r\nIn observing this I shall not be supposed to mean that any thing ought\r\nto be done which integrity will forbid; but merely that the scruples\r\nof delicacy and propriety, as relative to a common course of things,\r\nought to yield to the extraordinary nature of the crisis. They ought\r\nnot to hinder the taking of a legal and constitutional step to prevent\r\nan atheist in religion and a fanatic in politics from getting\r\npossession of the helm of state.\r\n\r\nYou, sir, know in a great degree the anti-federal party; but I fear\r\nyou do not know them as well as I do. 'Tis a composition, indeed, of\r\nvery incongruous materials, but all tending to mischief--some of them\r\nto the overthrow of the government, by stripping it of its due\r\nenergies; others of them to a revolution after the manner of\r\nBonaparte. I speak from indubitable facts, not from conjectures and\r\ninferences. In proportion as the true character of the party is\r\nunderstood, is the force of the considerations which urge to every\r\neffort to disappoint it; and it seems to me that there is a very\r\nsolemn obligation to employ the means in our power.\r\n\r\nThe calling of the legislature will have for object the choosing of\r\nelectors by the people in districts; this (as Pennsylvania will do\r\nnothing) will ensure a majority of votes in the United States for a\r\nfederal candidate. The measure will not fail to be approved by all the\r\nfederal party, while it will, no doubt, be condemned by the opposite.\r\nAs to its intrinsic nature, it is justified by unequivocal reasons of\r\n_public safety_.\r\n\r\nThe reasonable part of the world will, I believe, approve it. They\r\nwill see it as a proceeding out of the common course, but warranted by\r\nthe particular nature of the crisis and the great cause of social\r\norder.\r\n\r\nIf done, the motive ought to be frankly avowed. In your communication\r\nto the legislature, they ought to be told that temporary circumstances\r\nhad rendered it probable that, without their interposition, the\r\nexecutive authority of the general government would be transferred to\r\nhands hostile to the system heretofore pursued with so much success,\r\nand dangerous to the peace, happiness, and order of the country. That\r\nunder this impression, from facts convincing to your own mind, you had\r\nthought it your duty to give the existing legislature an opportunity\r\nof deliberating whether it would not be proper to interpose, and\r\nendeavour to prevent so great an evil, by referring the choice of\r\nelectors to the people distributed into districts.\r\n\r\nIn weighing this suggestion, you will doubtless bear in mind that\r\npopular governments must certainly be overturned; and, while they\r\nendure, prove engines of mischief, if one party will call to its aid\r\nall the resources which vice can give, and if the other (however\r\npressing the emergency) confines itself within all the ordinary forms\r\nof delicacy and decorum.\r\n\r\nThe legislature can be brought together in three weeks, so that there\r\nwill be full time for the object; but none ought to be lost.\r\n\r\nThink well, my dear sir, of this proposition; appreciate the extreme\r\ndanger of the crisis; and I am unusually mistaken in my view of the\r\nmatter if you do not see it right and expedient to adopt the measure.\r\n\r\nRespectfully and affectionately yours.\r\n\r\nMr. Jay's biographer adds--\"On this letter is the following\r\nendorsement in the governor's hand, _Proposing a measure for party\r\npurposes which I think it would not become me to adopt_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n1. As there were but _few_ of \"the most distinguished federalists in\r\nthe United States\" residing at that time in the city of New-York, the\r\nintelligent reader will form his own conclusions as to the source from\r\nwhence it emanated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1800 General Hamilton prepared for the press his\r\ncelebrated pamphlet, entitled--\"A letter from Alexander Hamilton,\r\nconcerning the public conduct and character of John Adams, Esq.,\r\npresident of the United States.\" It was the design of the author of\r\nthis pamphlet that it should be privately printed, and circulated in\r\nSouth Carolina only a few days before the election, for the purpose of\r\npreventing Mr. Adams from getting the vote of South Carolina, but\r\nsecuring it to Mr. Pinckney, who was the federal candidate for the\r\nvice-presidency. The consequence would have been to place Mr.\r\nPinckney's electoral vote higher than Mr. Adams's, and thus, if the\r\nfederal party succeeded, Mr. Pinckney would have been elected\r\npresident and Mr. Adams vice-president. Colonel Burr ascertained the\r\ncontents of this pamphlet, and that it was in the press. Its immediate\r\npublication, he knew, must distract the federal party, and thus\r\npromote the republican cause in those states where the elections had\r\nnot yet taken place. Arrangements were accordingly made for a copy, as\r\nsoon as the printing of it was completed; and when obtained, John\r\nSwartwout, Robert Swartwout, and Matthew L. Davis, by appointment, met\r\nColonel Burr at his own house. The pamphlet was read, and extracts\r\nmade for the press. Mr. Davis was charged with forwarding these\r\nextracts to William Duane, editor of the Aurora, and to Charles Holt,\r\neditor of the Bee, printed in New-London, which was accordingly done,\r\nand the extracts immediately published. [1]\r\n\r\nThe effect of this sudden and unexpected explosion was such as might\r\nhave been anticipated. It rent the federal party in twain. The\r\npublication, from time to time, of extracts, and the excitement which\r\nwas produced throughout the country by them, at length compelled Mr.\r\nHamilton to authorize the publication of the entire pamphlet; and\r\naccordingly, in October, as the electors were to be chosen in\r\nNovember, it was advertised for sale in the Daily Gazette. The editor\r\nof the paper explained that it was not the intention of General\r\nHamilton to give publicity to this letter at the time it was made\r\npublic; but that extracts from it by some unknown means had found\r\ntheir way to the public, and therefore the whole was now given.\r\n\r\nFurther evidence of the vigilance and efficiency of Colonel Burr in\r\npromoting the revolution of 1800 is deemed unnecessary. It is most\r\nsolemnly believed that the overthrow of the federal party at that time\r\nwould not have been accomplished but through his zeal, sagacity, and\r\nindustry. His friends, therefore, have ascribed to him, and not\r\nwithout some foundation, the election of Mr. Jefferson to the\r\npresidency.\r\n\r\nGovernor Jay having refused to comply with the wishes of \"one of the\r\nmost distinguished federalists in the United States,\" as proposing a\r\nmeasure for party purposes which he (Governor Jay) thought it would\r\nnot become him to adopt, the legislature did not convene until the\r\nfourth day of November, 1800, and on the sixth they proceeded to the\r\nchoice of electors for president and vice-president. The republican\r\nticket prevailed. It was composed of the following, persons:--\r\n\r\n    Isaac Ledyard, of Queen's County.\r\n\r\n    Anthony Lispenard, of New-York.\r\n\r\n    P. Van Courtlandt, of Westchester\r\n\r\n    James Burt, of Orange.\r\n\r\n    Gilbert Livingston, of Dutchess.\r\n\r\n    Thomas Jenkins, of Columbia.\r\n\r\n[continued list of Republican electors]\r\n\r\n    Peter Van Ness, of Columbia.\r\n\r\n    Robert Ellis, of Saratoga.\r\n\r\n    John Woodworth, of Rensellaer.\r\n\r\n    J. Van Rensellaer, of Albany.\r\n\r\n    Jacob Eacker, of Montgomery, and\r\n\r\n    William Floyd, of Suffolk.\r\n\r\nThe vote stood:--\r\n\r\n                      Republican.     Federal.\r\nIn the Senate 18 24 In the Assembly 64 39\r\n\r\nThus, on joint ballot, the republican majority was nineteen; and\r\nconsequently, as the city of New-York elected _twelve_ members, if the\r\nfederalists had succeeded in the city, they would have had, in joint\r\nballott, a majority of from six to ten.\r\n\r\nAs a part of the history of this election, the following letter and\r\nextracts from letters are here inserted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS JEFFERSON TO AARON BURR.\r\n\r\nWashington, December 15, 1800.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nAlthough we have not official information of the votes for president\r\nand vice-president, and cannot have until the first week in February,\r\nyet the state of the votes is given on such evidence as satisfies both\r\nparties that the two republican candidates stand highest. From South\r\nCarolina we have not even heard of the actual vote, but we have\r\nlearned who were appointed electors, and with sufficient certainty how\r\nthey would vote. It is said they would withdraw from yourself one\r\nvote. It has also been said that a General Smith, of Tennessee, had\r\ndeclared that he would give his second vote to Mr. Gallatin, not from\r\nany indisposition towards you, but extreme reverence to the character\r\nof Mr. Gallatin. It is also surmised that the vote of Georgia will not\r\nbe entire. Yet nobody pretends to know these things of a certainty,\r\nand we know enough to be certain that what it is surmised will be\r\nwithheld, will still leave you four or five votes at least above Mr.\r\nAdams. However, it was badly managed not to have arranged with\r\ncertainty what seems to have been left to hazard. It was the more\r\nmaterial, because I understand several high-flying federalists have\r\nexpressed their hope that the two republican tickets may be equal, and\r\ntheir determination in that case to prevent a choice by the House of\r\nRepresentatives (which they are strong enough to do), and let the\r\ngovernment devolve on a president of the Senate. Decency required that\r\nI should be so entirely passive during the late contest, that I never\r\nonce asked whether arrangements had been made to prevent so many from\r\ndropping votes intentionally as might frustrate half the republican\r\nwish; nor did I doubt, till lately, that such had been made.\r\n\r\n\"While I must congratulate you, my dear sir, on the issue of this\r\ncontest, because it is more honourable, and, doubtless, more grateful\r\nto you than any station within the competence of the chief magistrate,\r\nyet, for myself, and for the substantial service of the public, _I\r\nfeel most sensibly the loss we sustain of your aid in our new\r\nadministration. It leaves a chasm in my arrangements which cannot be\r\nadequately filled up. I had endeavoured to compose an administration\r\nwhose talents, integrity, names, and dispositions should at once\r\ninspire unbounded confidence in the public mind, and ensure a perfect\r\nharmony in the conduct of the public business. I lose you from the\r\nlist,_ and am not sure of all the others. Should the gentlemen who\r\npossess the public confidence decline taking a part in their affairs,\r\nand force us to take persons unknown to the people, the evil genius of\r\nthis country may realize his avowal that 'he will beat down the\r\nadministration.' The return of Mr. Van Benthuysen, one of your\r\nelectors, furnishes me a confidential opportunity of writing this much\r\nto you, which I should not have ventured through the postoffice at\r\nthis prying season. We shall, of course, see you before the fourth of\r\nMarch. Accept my respectful and affectionate salutations.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter is, in a great measure, incomprehensible. It indicates\r\nnothing but Mr. Jefferson's extreme terror and apprehension lest he\r\nshould be disappointed in his anticipated elevation to the presidency.\r\nIt displays the _tact_ of the ostrich, and the _sincerity_ of a\r\nrefined Jesuit. What does Mr. Jefferson mean by the declaration that\r\nhe had formed a cabinet, of which Mr. Burr was to be a member? What\r\nwhen he says--_\"I lose you from the list?_' Can any man believe that\r\nMr. Jefferson expected to be elected president, but that Colonel Burr\r\nwould be defeated; and that, acting upon such a state of facts, he had\r\nalready selected the members of his administration, and that Mr. Burr\r\nwas one of them? The supposition is absurd; but, without such a\r\nsupposition, what becomes of the truth of Mr. Jefferson's declaration\r\nwhen he says--\"I feel most sensibly the loss we sustain of your aid in\r\nour new administration. _It leaves a chasm in my arrangements_ which\r\ncannot be adequately filled up?\" If this letter is carefully read and\r\nanalyzed, its object may be comprehended. It was written a few weeks\r\nbefore the balloting was to take place in Congress. Mr. Jefferson\r\nexpresses doubt as to the vote Mr. Burr will receive, but considers it\r\ncertain that he will have \"four or five votes at least above Mr.\r\nAdams.\" Four days after this letter he writes in a very different tone\r\nto a friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. JEFFERSON TO MR. MADISON.\r\n\r\n\"Washington, December 19, 1800.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Brown's departure for Virginia enables me to write\r\nconfidentially what I would not have ventured by the post at this\r\nprying season. The election in South Carolina has, in some measure,\r\ndecided the great contest. Though, as yet, we do not know the actual\r\nvotes of Tennessee, Kentucky, and Vermont, yet we believe the votes to\r\nbe, on the whole, Jefferson, 73; Burr, 73; Adams, 65; Pinckney, 64.\r\nRhode Island withdrew one from Pinckney. There is a possibility that\r\nTennessee may withdraw _one_ from Burr, and Burr writes that there may\r\nbe one vote in Vermont for Jefferson. But I hold the latter\r\n_impossible_, and the former _not probable_; and that there will be an\r\nabsolute parity between the two republican candidates. This has\r\nproduced great dismay and gloom on the republican gentlemen here, and\r\nexultation in the federalists, who openly declare they will prevent an\r\nelection, and will name a president of the Senate _pro tem._ by what,\r\nthey say, would only be a _stretch_ of the constitution. The prospect\r\nof preventing this is as follows. Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee,\r\nKentucky, Vermont, Pennsylvania, and New-York can be counted on for\r\ntheir vote in the House of Representatives, and _it is thought, by\r\nsome, that BAER of Maryland and LINN of New-Jersey will come over._\"\r\n\r\nThe preceding extract shows that Mr. Jefferson entertained no doubt\r\n\"that there would be an absolute parity between the two republican\r\ncandidates,\" notwithstanding his doubting remarks on that subject to\r\nColonel Burr. Hopes were also entertained \"that Mr. Baer of Maryland\r\nand _Linn of New-Jersey would come over._\" Reference will hereafter be\r\nmade to these two states. The result of the electoral vote was as Mr.\r\nJefferson anticipated. _Seventy-three_ republican and _sixty-five_\r\nfederal.\r\n\r\nAlthough the ballots for president and vice-president had not been\r\nexamined officially, yet it was well known that there was a tie\r\nbetween Mr. Jefferson and Colonel Burr.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of February, 1801, Mr. Bayard, in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, offered a resolution declaring that, in case of a\r\ntie, the house would continue to ballot until a choice of president\r\nwas made. It was referred to a select committee, and, on the 10th, it,\r\nwith other rules to govern the house during the balloting, was\r\nadopted. The Senate passed a resolution that the ballots should be\r\nopened with closed doors. William H. Wells, of Delaware, of the\r\nSenate, and John Nicholas, of Virginia, and John Rutledge, of South\r\nCarolina, of the House of Representatives, were appointed tellers.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of February the ballots were opened. During the\r\nperformance of this ceremony a most extraordinary incident occurred.\r\nAs it is known to but few now living, and never been publicly spoken\r\nof, it has been deemed proper to record it here, as a part of the\r\nhistory of that exciting contest.\r\n\r\nThe Aurora of the 16th of February, 1801, remarks, that \"the tellers\r\ndeclared that there was some informality in the votes of Georgia; but,\r\nbelieving them to be true votes, reported them as such.\" No\r\nexplanation of the nature of this informality was given; nor is it\r\nknown that any has ever been given since. Had it been announced at the\r\ntime, there can be no doubt it would have proved fatal to the election\r\nof Mr. Jefferson. Whether the interest of our country would or would\r\nnot have been thereby promoted, is not a question for discussion here.\r\n\r\nBy the Constitution of the United States at that time it was provided,\r\nArt. 2, sect. 1, \"The electors shall meet in their respective states,\r\nand vote by ballot for two persons, of whom one at least shall not be\r\nan inhabitant of the same state with themselves. And they shall make a\r\nlist of all the persons voted for, and of the number of votes for\r\neach, _which list they shall sign, and certify_, and transmit, sealed,\r\nto the seat of the government of the United States, directed to the\r\nPresident of the Senate. The President of the Senate shall, in the\r\npresence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open _all the\r\ncertificates_, and the votes shall then be counted. The person having\r\nthe greatest number of votes shall be the president, if such number be\r\n_a majority of the whole number of electors appointed_; and if there\r\nbe more than one who have such majority, and have an equal number of\r\nvotes, then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose, by\r\nballot, one of them for president; and if no person have a majority,\r\nthen from the _five highest_ on the list the said house shall, in like\r\nmanner, choose the president. But, in choosing the president, the\r\nvotes shall betaken by states, and a majority of all the states shall\r\nbe necessary to a choice.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the above extract it will be seen that the Constitution is\r\nimperative as to the _form_ and _manner_ in which the electoral\r\nreturns are to be made. The ceremony of opening was performed in the\r\npresence of the two houses. The package of a state having been opened\r\nby the vice-president, it was handed by him to the tellers. Mr.\r\nJefferson was the presiding officer. On opening the package endorsed\r\nGeorgia votes, it was discovered to be totally irregular. The\r\nstatement now about to be given is derived from an honourable\r\ngentleman, a member of Congress from the state of New-York during the\r\nadministration of Mr. Jefferson, and yet living in this state. He says\r\nthat Mr. Wells (a teller on the part of the Senate) informed him that\r\nthe envelope was blank; that the return of the votes was not\r\nauthenticated by _the signatures of the electors, or any of them,\r\neither on the outside or the inside of the envelope, or in any other\r\nmanner_; that it merely stated in the inside that the votes of Georgia\r\nwere, for Thomas Jefferson _four, and for Aaron Burr _four_, without\r\nthe signature of any person whatsoever. Mr. Wells added, that he was\r\nvery undecided as to the proper course to be pursued by the tellers.\r\nIt was, however, suggested by one of them that the paper should be\r\nhanded to the presiding officer, without any statement from the\r\ntellers except that the return was informal; that he consented to this\r\narrangement under the firm conviction that Mr. Jefferson would\r\nannounce the nature of the informality from the chair; but, to his\r\nutmost surprise, he (Mr. Jefferson) rapidly declared that the votes of\r\nGeorgia were _four_ for Thomas Jefferson and _four_ for Aaron Burr,\r\nwithout noticing their informality, and in a hurried manner put them\r\naside, and then broke the seals and handed to the tellers the package\r\nfrom the next state. Mr. Wells observed, that as soon as Mr. Jefferson\r\nlooked at the paper purporting to contain a statement of the electoral\r\nvote of the state of Georgia, his countenance changed, but that the\r\ndecision and promptitude with which he acted on that occasion\r\nconvinced him of that which he (a federalist) and his party had always\r\ndoubted, that is to say, Mr. Jefferson's decision of character, at\r\nleast when his own interest was at hazard. Mr. Wells further stated,\r\nthat if the votes of Georgia had not been thus counted, as it would\r\nhave brought all the candidates into the house, Mr. Pinckney among the\r\nnumber, Mr. Jefferson could not have been elected president.\r\n\r\nThe same honourable member of Congress further stated, that some few\r\nyears after receiving the above information from Mr. Wells, he became\r\nintimately acquainted with John Nicholas, who was one of the tellers\r\nreferred to, and who had removed from Virginia into the western part\r\nof the State of New-York. Mr. Nicholas gave to the honourable member\r\nthe same statement in substance, not knowing that it had been\r\npreviously derived from Mr. Wells. Mr. Nicholas was a warm personal\r\nand political friend of Mr. Jefferson, and declared that he never felt\r\nso astounded in his life as when he discovered the irregularity. He\r\nclaimed some credit for the adroit manner in which he had managed Mr.\r\nRutledge, so far as to obtain his consent to hand the paper to Mr.\r\nJefferson without public explanation from the tellers, and which was\r\neffected by a conciliatory appeal to the magnanimity of the member\r\nfrom South Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe whole number of electoral votes given at the election in 1800 was\r\n_one hundred and thirty-eight_: necessary to a choice, _seventy_. Mr.\r\nJefferson and Mr. Burr had each, according to the return made,\r\nseventy-three. Georgia gave _four _votes. If that number had been\r\ndeducted from Jefferson and Burr, as illegally returned, of which\r\nthere is no doubt, they would have had only _sixty-nine_ votes each;\r\nconsequently they would not have had, in the language of the\r\nConstitution, \"a majority of the whole number of electors appointed,\"\r\nand the candidates out of which a choice of president must be made\r\nwould have been Mr. Jefferson, Mr. Burr, Mr. Adams, and Mr. Pinckney.\r\nThe federal members would then have said to the republicans, We will\r\nunite with you in the choice of either of the gentlemen presented to\r\nthe house except Mr. Jefferson; and if the government is to be brought\r\nto a termination by our failure to elect a president, the\r\nresponsibility will be on you. And is it to be believed, that in such\r\na case the _doubtful_ members who were sighing for office, if any such\r\nthere were, would have rejected the suggestion in toto?\r\n\r\nThe balloting continued from the 11th until the 17th of February\r\ninclusive. _Nine_ states were necessary to a choice. On the first\r\nballot Mr. Jefferson had _eight_, Mr. Burr _six_, and _two_ states\r\nwere divided. At every ballot the same result was announced, until the\r\n_thirty-sixth_ ballot, which was given on the 17th of February, when\r\nMr. Jefferson was declared duly elected, _ten_ states having voted for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nOn the first ballot Mr. Jefferson received New-York, New-Jersey,\r\nPennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina, Kentucky, Georgia, and\r\nTennessee--_eight_.\r\n\r\nMr. Burr received New-Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island,\r\nConnecticut, Delaware, and South Carolina --_six_.\r\n\r\nDivided, Vermont and Maryland--_two_.\r\n\r\nOn the final ballot Mr. Jefferson received New-York, New-Jersey,\r\nPennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina, Kentucky, Georgia, Tennessee,\r\nMaryland (_four_ votes and _four_ blanks), Vermont (_one_ vote and\r\n_one_ blank)--_ten_.\r\n\r\nMr. Burr received New-Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and\r\nConnecticut--_four_.\r\n\r\nDelaware _blank_, South Carolina _no vote_.\r\n\r\nDuring the balloting _one hundred and six_ members of the House of\r\nRepresentatives were present. Of this number _fifty-one_, on the first\r\nballot, voted for Mr. Jefferson; and on no subsequent vote was that\r\nnumber increased. The election was effected by the states of Maryland\r\nand Vermont giving their vote, instead of remaining _equally divided_,\r\nand thus having no vote; and that change was produced in Maryland by\r\nMr. Craick, Mr. Dennis, Mr. Baer, and Mr. Chew Thomas voting _blank_,\r\nand Mr. Lewis R. Morris, of Vermont, in like manner voting blank,\r\nleaving Mr. Matthew Lyon the sole representative of the state.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the balloting, Mr. Burr addressed to General S. Smith, of\r\nBaltimore, a member of the House of Representatives, the following\r\nletter. It will be seen by the date, that as soon as Colonel Burr\r\nsupposed that there was a probability of a tie, he constituted General\r\nSmith his proxy to declare his sentiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT.\r\n\r\n\"New-York, 16th December, 1800.\r\n\r\n\"It is highly improbable that I shall have an equal number of votes\r\nwith Mr. Jefferson; but, if such should be the result, every man who\r\nknows me ought to know that I would utterly disclaim all competition.\r\nBe assured that _the federal party can entertain no wish for such an\r\nexchange_. As to my friends, they would dishonour my views and insult\r\nmy feelings by a suspicion that I would submit to be instrumental in\r\ncounteracting the wishes and the expectations of the United States.\r\nAnd I now constitute you _my proxy to declare these sentiments_ if the\r\noccasion should require.\" [2]\r\n\r\nBaltimore, February 28, 1801.\r\n\r\nSir--Many of the citizens of Baltimore, who have just now heard of\r\nyour arrival among them, beg leave to congratulate you and themselves\r\nupon the success of the late election of President and Vice-president\r\nof the United States. They, in a particular manner, appreciate that\r\npatriotism which disclaimed competition for the presidential chair\r\nwith that other eminent character who has finally been called to\r\nit--as setting a just value upon the will of the people.\r\n\r\nBy order of the meeting.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS McELDERRY.\r\n\r\nTo Aaron Burr, Vice-president elect of the United States of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n1. Mr. Tucker, in his life of Jefferson, ascribes the defeat of the\r\nfederal party in South Carolina to General Hamilton's pamphlet. Its\r\npremature publication, no doubt, contributed largely to produce this\r\nresult.\r\n\r\n2. The effect of this letter upon public opinion may be judged of by\r\nthe following, among other testimonials which might be inserted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis contest in Congress produced, almost immediately, strong feelings\r\nof dissatisfaction between some of the friends of Mr. Jefferson and\r\nColonel Burr. Jealousies and distrust had previously existed. Mr.\r\nJefferson was anxious that Mr. Madison should be his successor in\r\noffice. The Clinton and Livingston families were prepared to unite in\r\na crusade against Colonel Burr; the chieftains of each section hoping\r\nto fill the station from which he was to be expelled. General Hamilton\r\nwas in favour of the election of Mr. Jefferson, as opposed to Colonel\r\nBurr. The result afforded him a triumph, and be was prepared, when\r\nopportunity should present, to prostrate his late successful opponent.\r\nSuch was the state of parties, and such the feelings of leading and\r\ndistinguished partisans, when Colonel Burr entered upon the\r\nvice-presidency, on the fourth of March, 1801. He was hemmed in on\r\nevery side by political adversaries, ready for the onset so soon as it\r\nshould be deemed expedient to make it. Every movement, every\r\nexpression at the convivial board or in the social circle, and every\r\naction, was carefully watched and noted for future use, if, by the\r\nexercise of ingenuity and misrepresentation, such expression or action\r\ncould be so tortured as to operate injuriously to him. These several\r\nsections, each acting within its own sphere, impelled by conflicting\r\nmotives, were untiring in their efforts to accomplish the great\r\nobject--the ruin of the vice-president. They combined wealth, talents,\r\nand government patronage.\r\n\r\nThe following short extracts from letters, written as early as 1794\r\nand 1795, will show what were the wishes of Mr. Jefferson (so far as\r\nany reliance can be placed on professions) in relation to Mr. Madison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS JEFFERSON TO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\"Monticello, December 28, 1794.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n\"I do not see in the minds of those with whom I converse a greater\r\naffliction than the fear of your retirement; [1] but this must not be,\r\n_unless to a more splendid and more efficacious post_. [2]\r\n\r\nThere I should rejoice to see you; I hope I may say, I shall rejoice\r\nto see you. I have long had much in my mind to say to you on that\r\nsubject; but double delicacies have kept me silent. I ought, perhaps,\r\nto say, _while I would not give up my own retirement for the empire of\r\nthe universe_, how I can justify wishing one, whose happiness I have\r\nso much at heart as yours, to take the front of the battle which is\r\nfighting for my security.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS JEFFERSON TO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\"Monticello, April 27, 1795.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n\"In mine, to which yours of March the twenty-third was an answer, I\r\nexpressed my hope of the only change of position I ever wished to see\r\nyou make, and I expressed it with entire sincerity, because there is\r\nnot another person in the United States who, being placed at the helm\r\nof our affairs, my mind would be so completely at rest for the fortune\r\nof our political bark. The wish, too, was pure, and unmixed with any\r\nthing respecting myself personally. * * * * * *\r\n\r\n\"If these general considerations were sufficient to ground a firm\r\nresolution never to permit myself to think of the office (president),\r\nor be thought of for it, the special ones which have supervened on my\r\nretirement still more insuperably bar the door to it. My health is\r\nentirely broken down within the last eight months; _my age requires\r\nthat I should place my affairs_ in a clear state; these are sound, if\r\ntaken care of, but capable of considerable dangers if longer\r\nneglected; and, above all things, the delights I feel in the society\r\nof my family, and in the agricultural pursuits in which I am so\r\neagerly engaged. _The little spice of ambition which I had in my\r\nyounger days has long since evaporated, and I set still less store by\r\na posthumous than present name_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact, that, previous to the balloting in Congress,\r\nall parties and sections of parties concurred in the opinion that the\r\nelection would finally be determined, as it was, by New-York,\r\nNew-Jersey, and Maryland. These _three_ states would render the\r\nelection of Colonel Burr certain; _two_ of them could elect Mr.\r\nJefferson. The vote, of New-York was to be decided by _Theodorus\r\nBailey_, of Dutchess county, and _Edward Livingston_, of the city of\r\nNew-York; the vote of New-Jersey by Mr. _Linn_, and the vote of\r\nMaryland by Mr. _Dent_ or Mr. _Baer_.\r\n\r\nIn the Commercial Advertiser of the thirteenth of February, 1801, a\r\npaper opposed to the election of Colonel Burr, there is published an\r\nextract of a letter from a member of Congress, dated Washington,\r\nFebruary 10, which states that, upon the second ballot, it is expected\r\nthat New-York, New-Jersey, and Maryland will vote for Mr. Burr.\r\n\r\nOn the sixth of February, 1801, a leading and influential republican\r\nmember of Congress writes to his correspondent a letter, from which\r\nthe following is extracted:--\r\n\r\n\"I have not time to answer your letter as fully as I could wish, as it\r\nwould have been my desire to communicate to you not only facts, _but\r\nsome of the reasons which have induced us to adopt the steps we have\r\nheretofore taken_. But, at all events, it is important that you should\r\nhave an immediate knowledge of the present situation of affairs.\r\n\r\n\"It is reduced to moral certainty, so far as any reliance can be\r\nplaced on the solemn determinations of men, that either Mr. Jefferson\r\nwill be chosen, or that there will be no choice made. The republican\r\nmajorities of eight states (including _Linn_ [3] of New-Jersey, and\r\nthe New-York representation, [4] the republican half of Maryland,\r\nincluding Mr. Dent, [5] and Lyon of Vermont, are _pledged_ to\r\npersevere in voting for Mr. Jefferson to the end, be the consequence\r\nwhat it will.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Burr, soon after his election, gave his enemies an opportunity\r\nto cavil. It would be impossible to enter into all the details\r\nconnected with this subject; but the principal charges which were made\r\nagainst the vice-president, and assigned as reasons for opposing his\r\nrenomination, will be briefly presented. The replies to or\r\nexplanations of them, by the parties implicated, will also be given.\r\n\r\nLate in November, 1801, when Mr. Burr was on his way to Washington to\r\ntake his seat in Senate as vice-president, he was addressed by certain\r\ncitizens of Baltimore, on which occasion he remarked, \"Time will not\r\nallow me to return you a written answer, but I must be permitted to\r\nstate my disapprobation of the mode of expressing public sentiment by\r\naddresses.\" This gave offence to some, and, by the artful and\r\ndesigning, was misrepresented. Mr. Burr, during the years 1798 and\r\n1799, had beheld, with mortification and disgust, the adulatory, if\r\nnot sycophantic addresses presented to President Adams. This reproof,\r\ntherefore, of his friends, evinced his natural independence of\r\ncharacter as well as the purest republican notions.\r\n\r\nIn the month of January, 1802, a bill to repeal what was termed by the\r\nrepublicans the federal midnight judiciary act, was pending before the\r\nSenate. On the 27th of January, a motion was made to refer the bill to\r\na committee for the purpose of amendment. On this motion the votes\r\nwere, _ayes_, 14; _noes_, 14. The vice-president, Colonel Burr, was in\r\nthe chair. He said--\"I am for the affirmative, because I never can\r\nresist the reference of a measure where the Senate is so nicely\r\nbalanced, and when the object is to effect amendment that may\r\naccommodate it to the opinions of a large majority, and particularly\r\nwhen I can believe that gentlemen are sincere in wishing a reference\r\nfor this purpose. Should it, however, at any time appear that delay\r\nonly is intended, my conduct will be different.\"\r\n\r\nThis decision afforded the enemies of Colonel Burr an opportunity to\r\nbreak ground more openly against him. He was now charged with aiding\r\nthe federal party in their efforts to embarrass the administration,\r\nand with the design of defeating the wishes of the American people. As\r\nyet, the charge of intriguing and negotiating with the federalists to\r\nobtain the presidency in opposition to Mr. Jefferson had not been\r\nmade. The allies had not yet sufficiently poisoned the public mind\r\nagainst the vice-president, nor had they subsidized the requisite\r\nnumber of presses for carrying on the work of destruction. While the\r\ngrand assault was meditating, and these _feints_ were carrying on\r\nagainst the vice-president, he was constantly receiving approbatory\r\nletters from intelligent and well-informed citizens, many of whom\r\ncowered beneath the storm when, in the height of its fury, it burst\r\nupon the victim. From among a number the following are selected:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM A. J. DALLAS.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 3d February, 1802.[6]\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nOn the judiciary question, I wrote my sentiments to Mr. Wilson\r\nNicholas early in the session. I am sorry our friends have taken so\r\nperemptory a position, as the very circumstance of having taken it\r\nwill render it difficult to move them. I cannot concur with them in\r\nthe policy or expediency of the measure. The business of the court\r\nwill not allow me to give my reasons in detail, but you shall have my\r\nbrief.\r\n\r\n1. There never was a case in which a party could be more justified in\r\nexpressing their resentment, on account of the manner of passing the\r\nact; the manner of organizing the courts; the nature of the opposition\r\nto the repeal, denying its constitutionality, and menacing a civil\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n2. The repeal would be constitutional, from a review of the\r\nprinciples, and terms of the constitution itself; of the peculiar\r\nsituation of the country ; its growing population ; its extending\r\nprospects; its increasing wants, pursuits, and refinements, &c.; of\r\nthe analogy to the Judiciary Institution of England, where independent\r\nof the legislature is not within the policy or provision of the\r\nstatutes relative to the commissions of the judges; of the analogy to\r\nthe Judiciary Institutions of the sister states, which have all been\r\nsubject to legislative interference occasionally. In Pennsylvania\r\nparticularly, the constitution declares that the judges shall hold\r\ntheir commissions during good behaviour; yet it expressly authorizes\r\nthe legislature to abolish the Court of Common Pleas, &c.; and of the\r\nprecedents in the existing act of Congress, which is an exercise of\r\nthe power _sub modo_.\r\n\r\n3. But notwithstanding the indignation I feel, in common with our\r\nfriends, at the manner of passing the Circuit Court act; and\r\nnotwithstanding my perfect conviction that Congress has the power of\r\nrepealing the act, I think the repeal would be impolitic and\r\ninexpedient. If it would be impolitic acting on party principles, it\r\nwould be inexpedient of course; but I mean, also, that it would be\r\ninexpedient on account of the use that Pennsylvania (and I presume the\r\nsame as to other states) has derived from the institution:\r\n\r\n1st. _It is impolitic_.\r\n\r\nThe republicans are not agreed on the constitutionality of the repeal.\r\nThe people at large have imbibed strong prejudices on the subject of\r\njudicial independence. The repeal would be ascribed to party\r\nanimosity; and if future amendments should be made, it would be\r\nconsidered as a personal proceeding, merely to remove the present\r\njudges: the hazard of loss in public opinion is greater than the hope\r\nof gain. There is a mass of the community that will not be fermented\r\nby the leaven of party passions. By persons of this description, the\r\nmotive and effect will be strictly analyzed and purified. The mere\r\nresuscitation of the old system will either expose the administration\r\nof justice to inconceivable embarrassments, or demonstrate the motive\r\nto be abstractedly a party one, by calling for an immediate reform.\r\nThe clamour of the federalists will at least have a reasonable\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\n2. _It is inexpedient_.\r\n\r\nThe mere repeal will reinstate a system which every man of common\r\nsense and candour must deprecate. It will entirely destroy\r\ninstitutions susceptible of being modelled into a form economical as\r\nwell as useful. It will deprive some states of tribunals which have\r\nbeen found highly advantageous, to the despatch of business. I allude\r\nparticularly to Pennsylvania. In this state justice, as far as\r\nrespects our state courts, is in a state of dissolution, from the\r\nexcess of business and the parsimony of the legislature.\r\n\r\nWith this view of the subject you will perceive that I think--_First_,\r\nThere ought not to be a total repeal. _Second_, There ought to be\r\namendments.\r\n\r\nIf, however, a repeal should take place, I am clearly of opinion that\r\nit would be unjustifiable to make any provision for the ex-judges. On\r\nthis point and on the introduction of amendments I will, if you desire\r\nit, amplify by a future post.\r\n\r\nThe zealous republicans are exciting some intemperance here, in\r\nopposition to a memorial from our bar, which, you will perceive, is\r\nconfined to the operation of the law in this state as a matter of\r\nfact, and not to any controversy of a constitutional or political\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nI shall be anxious to hear from you as often as you can spare a\r\nmoment, and particularly while the judiciary bill is pending.\r\n\r\nYours, with great regard,\r\n\r\nA. J. DALLAS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM NATHANIEL NILES.\r\n\r\nFebruary 17, 1802.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nPermit me to thank you most sincerely for the vote you gave in favour\r\nof Mr. Dayton's motion to refer the judiciary bill to a select\r\ncommittee; not because I am by any means satisfied it is not best that\r\nbill should pass, but because I earnestly desire that republicanism\r\nshould on every occasion display the spirit of conciliation, as far as\r\ncan be done without the destruction of principle. I am every day more\r\nand more satisfied that the cause is more endangered by the want of\r\nsuch displays than by every thing besides. The fate of parties in and\r\nabout Congress will ultimately be determined by the great body of the\r\nwell informed in the middle walks of life. It is happy, in some\r\nrespects, that these are generally so far from the scene of action as\r\nto be tolerably free from the blinding influence of those passions\r\nwhich the scene itself is calculated to excite. They wish for every\r\nthing that tends to convince the great public that republicanism,\r\ninstead of being hostile, is friendly to moderation and harmony. Shall\r\nwe not do well to mark with great care and precision the sunken rocks\r\nand shoals on which self-denominated federalism has dashed itself to\r\npieces? Among these I would enumerate their too eager and violent\r\npursuit of their object. Had they been patient and accommodating, the\r\neyes of the public would have been still hoodwinked, until habit,\r\ngradually acquired, would have rendered an expensive monarchy the most\r\nagreeable government. But, thank Heaven, they, by overacting, exposed\r\ntheir own feelings and designs. Will not the same pertinacity and\r\nprecipitation endanger the better--the opposite cause? It is a\r\nprevalent idea among us middling people, that a good government must\r\nbe a moderate one; and we are exceedingly apt to judge of the spirit\r\nof the government from the spirit of our rulers. Every thing\r\nnon-conciliating bears in its very front strong symptoms of a\r\ntyrannical spirit.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, the more gratified by your moderation because (though I am\r\nashamed to avow it) I have heard you was too impetuous. Pardon my\r\nmistake; and suffer me to entreat you to encourage a steady pursuit of\r\nrepublican measures in that way which will convince the bystanders\r\nthat the actors are uniformly and irresistibly urged to pursue them by\r\ncool conviction, resulting from a candid, extensive, and philanthropic\r\nsurvey of the great object. Passion and caprice very illy become so\r\nawfully sublime an object as that for which well-informed republicans\r\ncontend.\r\n\r\nWith sentiments of respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL NILES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM A. J. DALLAS.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, 3d April, 1802.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nThe judiciary storm has passed away for the present. I perceive,\r\nhowever, that an effort is making to improve the old system without\r\nincreasing the number of judges; and we are once more unanimous at the\r\nbar of Philadelphia in rejoicing that Paterson, and not Chase,\r\npresides in our circuit. I had begun an outline of courts and\r\njurisdictions agreeably to your wish; but I lost the hope of its being\r\nadopted when finished, so I abandoned the labour. Perhaps it may be\r\nworth while to renew the scheme, with a view to a future session.\r\n\r\nThere are some rumours of jealousy and dissatisfaction prevailing\r\namong the republican leaders, in the executive as well as the\r\nlegislative departments of the federal as well as of our state\r\ngovernment. It will be disgraceful, indeed, if the rumours axe true.\r\nVery sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nA. J. DALLAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch were the sentiments and views of many of the most pure and\r\nintelligent of the republican party in relation to a repeal of the\r\njudiciary act of 1800. The preceding letters express the opinions\r\nentertained by thousands who were opposed to federal men and federal\r\nmeasures, but who wanted time for reflection; and yet, when Colonel\r\nBurr voted to recommit the repealing bill for the purpose of\r\nascertaining whether it could not be rendered more satisfactory, the\r\nconspirators cried aloud, _Crucify him--crucify him_.\r\n\r\nThe plot now began to thicken. During the year 1801, a Scotchman by\r\nthe name of Wood was employed to write \"_A History of John Adams's\r\nAdministration_.\" Ward & Barlas, booksellers in New-York, were the\r\nproprietors of the copyright, and printed 1250 copies. William Duane,\r\neditor of the Aurora, furnished the author a portion of his materials,\r\nand became the agent to negotiate with a London bookseller for the\r\npublication of an edition in England. In the summer or autumn of 1801\r\nColonel Burr was informed of the progress of the work, and procured a\r\ncopy before it was ready for publication. On examining it, he came to\r\nthe conclusion that it was calculated to do the republican party more\r\ninjury than good. It abounded with misrepresentations, errors, and\r\nlibels. Mr. Burr, through a friend, agreed to pay a stipulated sum for\r\nthe suppression of the work, under the most solemn assurance that no\r\ncopy or copies would be permitted to go into the hands of any third\r\nperson, but that the whole edition should be delivered to the agent\r\nwho was to pay the money. Before the time of payment arrived, it was\r\nascertained that a copy or copies had been parted with, and would not\r\nbe returned. The contract was, therefore, never carried into effect.\r\nPending this negotiation, Mr. Duane, through Wood or Ward & Barlas,\r\nwas made acquainted with the arrangements which were in progress.\r\nCheetham, the editor of the American Citizen, was also informed of\r\nwhat was doing. This was considered a most favourable opportunity for\r\nassailing the vice-president, and charging him with the design of\r\nsuppressing the History of John Adams's Administration for the purpose\r\nof keeping the people in ignorance of the wrong doings of the federal\r\nparty. Although the assailants had a full view of the whole ground,\r\nyet the attack was commenced by innuendoes, indicating ignorance of\r\nthe true state of facts. The charge operated most injuriously upon the\r\nrepublican character of Colonel Burr. The injury was irreparable, and\r\nthe attacks continued with unexampled malignity.\r\n\r\nThis brief statement, it is hoped, will be found sufficiently explicit\r\nto be intelligible. And now for the conduct of Mr. Duane on the\r\noccasion. His object, and the object of his employers, was\r\naccomplished; but whether a short development of the whole case will\r\nor will not add to his fame, the reader must determine.\r\n\r\nOn or about the 27th of February, 1802, the editor of the Aurora, in\r\nhis paper, states that a curious fact has lately been brought to light\r\nin New-York; that Wood had completed his engagement with Ward & Barlas\r\nto furnish a history of John Adams's Administration, and that 1250\r\ncopies were printed, but suppressed at the desire of some person. Mr.\r\nDuane then animadverts with harshness, and expresses a wish to get a\r\nclew to the names of the person or persons who suppressed the work.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of May, 1802, the Aurora states that the American Citizen\r\nand the Evening Post have commenced a warfare, of which Mr. Burr is\r\nthe object; that the principal matter of charge is the suppression of\r\nWood's History of John Adams's Administration; and then adds--\"We are\r\nfully possessed of one side of the subject, and have perused the\r\nsuppressed book attentively.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of July, 1802, the Aurora says--\"So far as it relates to\r\nMr. Burr, my opinions have been uniform and reiterated to his\r\nparticular friends, that if the motives for the suppression of the\r\nbook were not _satisfactorily explained to the public_, his standing\r\nwith the republican interest was gone.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the period between February and July, 1802, the Aurora\r\nreprinted the slanders of Cheetham against Mr. Burr in relation to the\r\nsuppressed book, and continued, from time to time, his own attacks\r\nupon the vice-president. While thus _publicly_ giving currency to\r\nthese calumnies, would it be believed (if asserted) that Mr. Duane was\r\n_privately_ writing Colonel Burr, and approving of his conduct in\r\nsuppressing the work? One of his letters on this subject is deemed\r\nsufficient to a right understanding of the case. It will now be given\r\nwithout comment. * * * * *\r\n\r\nFROM WILLIAM DUANE.\r\n\r\nThursday, April 15, 1802.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI think it fortunate that the pamphlet of Mr. Wood has not yet been\r\npublished, and that it would be much more so if it were not ever to\r\nsee the light. It has disappointed my expectations of finding in it at\r\nleast some useful reflections and reasonings, however little novelty\r\nthere might be in the facts. But, even in the narration of facts, I\r\nfind numerous errors, and not a few misrepresentations of things\r\nnotorious to every man who has attended with understanding to the\r\ncourse of public affairs. There is in it a _something_, too, of a\r\ncharacter very different from what was represented to me; the adoption\r\nof the story of Hamilton [7] and Lafayette, if it is not the effect of\r\nan indifference to accuracy, or a coldness in pursuit of truth, is\r\nsomething much worse, and at least is suspicious: there is more of the\r\nsame kind of matter, and less attention to the influence and views of\r\nsuch characters, than the subject required. I consider it, upon the\r\nwhole, as a hasty, crude, and inconsistent production, calculated\r\nrather to produce evil than the least good--as it would be attributed\r\nto the republicans, with all its faults and inconsistencies, and a\r\ncredit assumed from it as a party confession of merit, in a particular\r\ncharacter, which is not founded, at least in the way stated in the\r\npamphlet. Were some parts of it omitted, and false statements\r\nrectified, it might not do any harm; and perhaps it might be found\r\nadvisable to adopt some plan of that kind, making a careful _record of\r\nthe omissions_ to insert any future _misrepresentations_, and a like\r\nrecord of such _additions_ or _alterations_. This might be very easily\r\ndone by printing the pages anew which contain the exceptionable parts,\r\nand, if necessary, substituting reflections or anecdotes, founded in\r\nfact, in their places. This might be done at a small expense. The\r\nthing, thus corrected, published; and, if any effort should be made to\r\nmisrepresent, credit would be derived even by the defence, and the\r\nexposure of the motives for suppressing the misstatements.\r\n\r\nThis I have thought proper to write you, and I hope will, in its\r\nobject and motives, find with you an excuse for doing so.\r\n\r\nI am, with respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nWILLIAM DUANE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n1.

The story here referred to is thus related by Wood in his history:\r\n\"In the year 1780, he (Hamilton) was promoted to the rank of colonel,\r\nand at the siege of Yorktown commanded the attack on one of the\r\nredoubts, the capture of which decided the fate of Lord Cornwallis and\r\nhis army. The conduct of Mr. Hamilton on this occasion was truly\r\nhonourable, and, in the history of his life, ought to weigh against\r\nseveral of those scars that have since stained his character. Previous\r\nto the attack, the Marquis de Lafayette proposed to General Washington\r\nto put to death all the British troops that should be found in the\r\nredoubts, as a retaliation for several acts of barbarity committed by\r\nthe royal army. The steady and nervous mind of Washington, which was\r\never known to yield to the virtuous prejudice of compassion, gave his\r\nassent to the bloody order. But Mr. Hamilton (the tenderness of whose\r\nfeelings has led him into error), after the redoubts were subdued,\r\ntook the conquered under his protection, and proved to his enemies\r\nthat Americans know how to fight, but not to murder.\" [General\r\nHamilton, in a letter referring to this same story, says--\"Positively\r\nand unequivocally, I declare that no such or similar order, or any\r\nintimation or hint resembling it, was ever by me received or\r\nunderstood to have been given.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nColonel Burr's silence under these reiterated attacks, with such means\r\nof defence as his enemies knew that he possessed, encouraged and\r\nimboldened them to make other and more daring assaults. He was now\r\ncharged, in general terms, with intriguing for the presidency, in\r\nopposition to Mr. Jefferson; with endeavouring to obtain federal\r\nelectoral votes, and thus to defeat Mr. Jefferson and promote his own\r\nelevation; with having entered into terms and conditions with federal\r\nmembers of Congress in the winter of 1800; and with having committed\r\nhimself to, that party, in the event of success through their\r\ninstrumentality. These slanders were countenanced and circulated in\r\nwhispers by men high in authority, until the political integrity of\r\nColonel Burr was so far ruined as to render any defence, on his part\r\nor on the part of his friends, useless and unavailing. The hireling\r\npress now boldly entered upon specific charges; naming the parties\r\nwith whom Colonel Burr or his friends had negotiated, and the agents\r\nwhom the vice-president had employed to effect his purposes. These\r\ndetails were given in a manner so circumstantial, as, by their\r\naudacity, seemingly to command confidence. The slanders were\r\ncirculated with industry and rapidity, while the contradictions rarely\r\nmet the public eye, except through the medium of a federal press,\r\nwhich publication, with the already prejudiced republican, was\r\nconstrued as evidence of the truth of the charge. The principal\r\ninstances of specific cases will now be presented as briefly as\r\npracticable.\r\n\r\nThe presidential electors of the state of New-Jersey were federal. Dr.\r\nSamuel S. Smith, president of Princeton College, was an elector. The\r\nHon. Jno. B. Prevost, son of Mrs. Burr by her first husband, was\r\nmarried to the daughter of Dr. Smith. This circumstance rendered\r\nplausible a story invented and propagated by the calumniators of\r\nColonel Burr. They boldly charged that \"_Dr. Smith, of New-Jersey, was\r\nsecretly to have voted for Mr. Burr, and thus made him President of\r\nthe United States_.\" To this charge Dr. Smith replied as follows :--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE EDITOR OF THE EVENING POST.\r\n\r\nPrinceton, July 29, 1802.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nIn your paper of Monday, July 26, under the article entitled _A View\r\nof the Political Conduct of Aaron Burr, Esq_., by the author of the\r\n_Narrative_, I observe some very gross misrepresentations, which I\r\nconceive it to be a duty that I owe to Mr. Burr, the New-Jersey\r\nelectors, and myself, to declare to be absolutely false. Mr. Burr\r\nnever visited me on the subject of the late election for president and\r\nvice-president--Mr. Burr never conversed with me a single second on\r\nthe subject of that election, either before or since the event. No\r\nproject or plan of the kind mentioned in that paper was proposed or\r\nhinted at among the electors of New-Jersey. I am assured that Mr. Burr\r\nheld no intrigue with them on that occasion, either collectively or\r\nindividually. They were men above intrigue; and I do not know that he\r\nwas disposed to use it. At their meeting, they unanimously declared\r\nthat a fair and manly vote, according to their sentiments, was the\r\nonly conduct which was worthy of their own characters or of their\r\ncause.\r\n\r\n\"SAMUEL. S. SMITH.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was next charged that Colonel Burr had sent, at his own expense,\r\nspecial agents to different states, previous to the choice of\r\nelectors, with the view of influencing their selection, and to promote\r\nhis own elevation to the exclusion of Mr. Jefferson. The agents named\r\nwere Mr. Abraham Bishop, of New-Haven, and Mr. Timothy Green, of\r\nNew-York. It was asserted that Mr. Bishop was Mr. Burr's agent at\r\nLancaster, Pennsylvania, during the session of the legislature that\r\nappointed the presidential electors.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1802, Mr. Bishop published a full and explicit refutation\r\nof the charge. He denied that Mr. Burr sent him to Lancaster, or that\r\nhe went there for any purposes personally or politically regarding\r\nthat gentleman. The publication of Mr. Bishop is not readily to be\r\nfound; but he is still living, and subsequently was appointed by Mr.\r\nJefferson collector of the port of New-Haven.\r\n\r\nIn relation to Mr. Green, it was alleged that he was sent to Columbia,\r\nSouth Carolina, for similar purposes, and that he \"_corresponded with\r\nthe vice-president on the subject of the then approaching election,\r\nunder cover to John Swartwout_.\" The replies of Mr. Green and Mr.\r\nSwartwout were as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"New-York, October 11, 1802,\r\n\r\n\"MESSRS. DENNISTON AND CHEETHAM,\r\n\r\n\"In the _American Citizen_ of this day you have made a publication, to\r\nwhich you have affixed your names. In this you have stated, 1st, That\r\nTimothy Green, of this city, was despatched as an agent to Columbia,\r\nthe seat of government of the state of South Carolina, by the\r\nvice-president. 2dly, That he was the eulogist and intercessor for the\r\nvice-president. 3dly, That he sent the vice-president despatches\r\nregularly, addressed to Mr. John Swartwout, of this city, under cover.\r\n\r\n\"Now, as you have been most egregiously imposed upon by some\r\ndisorganizing person, it is your duty and mine that the public be\r\nimmediately furnished with both what were and what were not my\r\ninducements and motives in making a journey in November, 1800, to\r\nColumbia, and of my conduct while there. For this purpose you will\r\nplease to insert in your paper of to-morrow the following corrections\r\nto your statement:--\r\n\r\n\"1st, I aver that I never went on any message of a political nature to\r\nColumbia, in South Carolina, or to any other place for the\r\nvice-president or any other person; neither was I ever requested or\r\ndesired by the vice- president or by any other person to go to\r\nColumbia, in South Carolina, or any other place, on any political or\r\nelectioneering mission, of any name or nature whatsoever. On the\r\ncontrary, my journey to Columbia, in South Carolina, in the year of\r\nour Lord 1800, and my engagements until my return in 1801, was wholly\r\nunsolicited by any person (except my debtors in South Carolina), and\r\nwere solely of a commercial nature, and for which I had been preparing\r\neight months before.\r\n\r\n\"2dly, That I never wrote a letter to the vice-president of a\r\npolitical nature; neither did I write him any information relative to\r\nthe presidential election in South Carolina, neither did I ever\r\nenclose a letter, directed to the vice-president, in a letter or cover\r\ndirected to Mr. John Swartwout.\r\n\r\n\"3dly, That my letters to Mr. Swartwout while in South Carolina were\r\nunsolicited, and written solely with the motive to relieve the minds\r\nof my friends from the anxiety necessarily attendant on a state of\r\nsuspense, while an important event is hourly expected to take place.\r\n\r\n\"4thly, That I never was in the habit of eulogizing public men,\r\nneither did I vary from my usual manners while in South Carolina. I\r\nhad no occasion to intercede for the election of Colonel Burr: all the\r\nfear I had while there was lest a compromise should take place, as the\r\npolitical parties were nearly balanced in the state legislature. This\r\nI did, as far as in my power, conscientiously endeavour to prevent;\r\nknowing that, if union and good faith were not inviolably preserved\r\namong the constitutional republicans, our past, present, and future\r\nexertions would be unavailing.\r\n\r\n\"TIMOTHY GREEN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE AMERICAN CITIZEN.\r\n\r\n\"New-York, October 13, 1802.\r\n\r\n\"MESSRS. DENNISTON AND CHEETHAM,\r\n\r\n\"In your seventh letter addressed to Aaron Burr, Esq., Vice-president\r\nof the United States, published in the American Citizen of the 11th\r\ninstant, I notice the following paragraph, viz.:--\r\n\r\n\"Meantime, Sir, you had your eye on South Carolina; you despatched an\r\nagent, Mr. Timothy Green, of this city, to Columbia, the seat of\r\ngovernment of that state. It was questionable whether South Carolina\r\nwould give you a single vote. At that period you were scarcely known\r\nin the state. Mr. Green was at Columbia at least two months. He, was\r\nyour eulogist; your intercessor; he sent you despatches regularly;\r\nthey were addressed to Mr. John Swartwout, of this city, under cover,\r\nand by him communicated to you.\r\n\r\n\"You will please to inform the public, through the medium of your\r\npaper, that the above paragraph, so far as relates to my receiving\r\nletters under cover, or communications from Timothy Green for Aaron\r\nBurr, is utterly destitute of truth.\r\n\r\n\"JOHN SWARTWOUT.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a pamphlet entitled \"A View of Aaron Burr's Political Conduct,\" it\r\nwas charged that \"Mr. Burr, while in the city of New-York, carried on\r\na negotiation with the heads of the federal party at Washington with a\r\nview to his election as President of the United States. A person was\r\nauthorized by them to confer with him on the subject, who accordingly\r\ndid so. Mr. Burr assented to the propositions of the negotiator, and\r\nreferred him to his confidential friend to complete the negotiation.\r\nMr. Burr stated that, after the first vote taken in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, New-York and Tennessee would give in to the\r\nfederalists.\"\r\n\r\nTo this Colonel Burr replied, in a letter to _Governor Bloomfield_, of\r\nNew-Jersey, under date September 21, 1802:--\r\n\r\n\"You are at liberty to declare from me that all those charges and\r\ninsinuations which aver or intimate that I advised or countenanced the\r\nopposition made to Mr. Jefferson pending the late election and\r\nballoting for president; that I proposed or agreed to any terms with\r\nthe federal party; that I assented to be held up in opposition to him,\r\nor attempted to withdraw from him the vote or support of any man,\r\nwhether in or out of Congress; THAT ALL SUCH ASSERTIONS AND\r\nINTIMATIONS ARE FALSE AND GROUNDLESS.\"\r\n\r\nIn the pamphlet already referred to, and various newspaper\r\npublications, it was alleged that General Hamilton had personal\r\nknowledge of Colonel Burr's negotiations with the federalists. On the\r\n13th of October, 1802, the editor of the New-York Evening Post\r\n(William Coleman) states that he is authorized to say that General\r\nHamilton, at a dinner at Edward Livingston's, declared that he had no\r\npersonal knowledge of any negotiation in reference to the presidency\r\nbetween Colonel Burr and any person whatever.\r\n\r\nIt will be recollected that Colonel Burr, in his letter to Governor\r\nBloomfield, denied the charge of \"having proposed or agreed to any\r\nterms with the federal party.\" The person named as being the agent of\r\nthe federalists, with authority to confer with Colonel Burr, was David\r\nA. Ogden, Esq., of the city of New-York, who was intimately connected\r\nwith General Hamilton in professional business. Dr. Peter Irving was\r\nat that time the proprietor and editor of a highly respectable daily\r\njournal (Morning Chronicle) published in the city of New-York. The\r\nfacts in relation to this charge are developed in the following\r\nletters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP. IRVING TO DANIEL A. OGDEN.\r\n\r\n\"New-York, November 24, 1802.\r\n\r\n\"SIR,\r\n\r\n\"Though I have not the pleasure of a personal acquaintance with you, I\r\nflatter myself that the contents of this letter will preclude the\r\nnecessity of an apology for addressing you.\r\n\r\n\"It has been asserted in various publications that Mr. Burr, during\r\nthe late election for president and vice-president, entered into\r\nnegotiations and agreed to terms with the federal party, or with\r\ncertain individuals of that party, with a view to advance himself to\r\nthe office of president to the exclusion of Mr. Jefferson. Mr. Burr,\r\nin a letter to Governor Bloomfield, dated the 21st of September last,\r\ndeclared that all such allegations were false and groundless; and the\r\ncharges have been renewed in more recent publications, which point to\r\nyou by name as the person through whom such negotiations were carried\r\non and terms concluded. It has now become interesting to a great\r\nportion of the community to be informed how far these assertions and\r\ncharges have been authorized by you, or are warranted by your\r\nknowledge of facts.\r\n\r\n\"Having received frequent anonymous communications for the Morning\r\nChronicle relative to these matters, and being unwilling to occupy the\r\npaper with vague and unsubstantial conjectures or remarks on a subject\r\nof such importance, I am induced to apply directly to yourself as an\r\nauthentic source of information. I do this with the more confidence,\r\nfrom a persuasion that you can have no wish to suffer false reports to\r\ncirculate under the authority of your name for mere party purposes;\r\nand that, in the actual posture of things, you cannot be averse to\r\ndeclare publicly and explicitly your agency, if any, in the business.\r\nI take the liberty, therefore, of requesting your written declaration\r\nto the points above stated, together with any circumstances you may be\r\npleased to communicate tending to establish the truth or falsehood of\r\nthe charges in question.\r\n\r\n\"I have the honour to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nP. IRVING.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDAVID A. OGDEN TO P. IRVING.\r\n\r\nNew-York, November 24, 1802.\r\n\r\n\"SIR,\r\n\r\n\"Though I did not conceive it to be incumbent upon me, or in itself\r\nproper to notice a publication in a newspaper in which my name was\r\nused without my permission or knowledge, yet I have no objection to\r\nreply to an inquiry which comes in the shape of that contained in your\r\nletter, and from a person of your standing in society.\r\n\r\n\"I declare that my journey to the city of Washington, in the year\r\n1800, was purely on private business, and without any understanding or\r\nconcert whatever with Colonel Burr, whom I met at the stage-office on\r\nhis way to Trenton, not having had before the least intimation of such\r\na meeting; and that I was not then or at any time charged by him with\r\nany commission or errand of a political nature. In the course of our\r\njourney, no political conversation took place but of a general nature\r\nand in the presence of the passengers.\r\n\r\n\"When about to return from the city of Washington, two or three\r\nmembers of Congress, of the federal party, spoke to me about their\r\nviews as to the election of president, desiring me to converse with\r\nColonel Burr on the subject, and to ascertain whether he would enter\r\ninto terms. On my return to New-York I called on Colonel Burr, and\r\ncommunicated the above to him. He explicitly declined the explanation,\r\nand did neither propose nor agree to any terms. I had no other\r\ninterview or communication with him on the subject; and so little was\r\nI satisfied with this, that in a letter which I soon afterward wrote\r\nto a member of Congress, and which was the only one I wrote, I\r\ndissuaded from giving support to Colonel Burr, and advised rather to\r\nacquiesce in the election of Mr. Jefferson, as the less dangerous man\r\nof the two to that cause with which I believed the public interest to\r\nbe inseparably connected.\r\n\r\n\"There are no facts within my knowledge tending to establish the truth\r\nof the charges specified in your letter.\r\n\r\n\"With due respect, I am, sir, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\"DAVID A. OGDEN.\r\n\r\n\"DR. P. IRVING.\"\r\n\r\nIt was then boldly asserted that Edward Livingston was \"the\r\nconfidential friend\" to whom Mr. Ogden was referred \"to complete the\r\nnegotiation;\" whereupon Mr. Burr made a call upon Mr. Livingston, to\r\nwhich the following reply was given:--\r\n\r\n\"SIR,\r\n\r\n\"In consequence of certain insinuations lately circulated, I think it\r\nproper to declare that you did not, in any verbal or written\r\ncommunication to me, during the late presidential election, express\r\nany sentiment inconsistent with those contained in your letter to\r\nGeneral Smith, [1] which was published, or evincing any desire that\r\nthe vote of the state should be transferred from Mr. Jefferson to\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\n\"I am, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,\r\n\r\n(Signed) \"EDWARD LIVINGSTON.\r\n\r\n\"The Vice-president of the United States.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the hope of giving some support to these, calumnies, Mr. William S.\r\nPennington, of New-Jersey, addressed a letter to the editors of the\r\nAmerican Citizen, in which he asserted that General John Swartwout had\r\nwritten to Robert Williams, of Poughkeepsie, pending the election,\r\nrecommending or countenancing the support of Mr. Burr for president to\r\nthe exclusion of Mr. Jefferson. To this General Swartwout replied:--\r\n\r\nTO THE PUBLIC.\r\n\r\n\"The false colouring given by the relation of one William S.\r\nPennington, in a letter to Denniston & Cheetham, which appeared in the\r\nAmerican Citizen of the 22d inst., and their subsequent malicious\r\nremarks, oblige me once more to ask pardon for obtruding myself on the\r\npublic attention.\r\n\r\n\"I declare, on my honour, that I did not at any time advise the\r\nelection of Mr. Burr as president of the United States to the\r\nexclusion of Mr. Jefferson; nor did I ever write to any person or\r\npersons to that effect; and I hereby authorize Mr. Robert Williams to\r\npublish any letter or letters he may have received from me on the\r\nsubject of the late presidential election. I am induced to contradict\r\nthe base slanders of those exclusive patriots by a regard to truth\r\nonly, and not from a conviction that it would have been either\r\ndishonourable to me, or disadvantageous to the country or the\r\nrepublican party, to have promoted the election of Mr. Burr to the\r\npresidential chair.\r\n\r\n\"JOHN SWARTWOUT.\r\n\r\n\"New-York, January 23.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principal specifications, intended as explanatory of the general\r\ncharge against Colonel Burr of intriguing for the presidency, have now\r\nbeen given. The replies of the parties implicated accompany them. A\r\nwhole generation has passed away since these scenes occurred, and yet\r\nthe time has not arrived when they can be calmly reviewed with\r\nimpartiality and free from prejudice. They may serve, however, as\r\nbeacon-lights for those who are now figuring or may hereafter figure\r\non the great political theatre of our country. Through life, Colonel\r\nBurr committed an error, if he did not display a weakness, in\r\npermitting his reputation to be assailed, without contradiction, in\r\ncases where it was perfectly defensible. His enemies took advantage of\r\nthe sullen silence which he was known to preserve in regard to\r\nnewspaper attacks. Under these attacks he fell from the proud eminence\r\nhe once enjoyed to a condition more mortifying and more prostrate than\r\nany distinguished man has ever experienced in the United States.\r\n\r\nDifferent individuals, to gratify different feelings, have ascribed\r\nthis unprecedented fall to different causes. But one who is not\r\naltogether ignorant of the springs of human actions; whose\r\npartialities and prejudices are mellowed by more than threescore years\r\nof experience; who has carefully and laboriously, in this case,\r\nexamined cause and effect, hesitates not in declaring that, from the\r\nmoment Aaron Burr was elected vice-president, his doom was unalterably\r\ndecided, if that decision could be accomplished by a combination of\r\nwealth, of talent, of government patronage, of favouritism and\r\nproscription, inflamed by the worst passions, and nurtured by the hope\r\nof gratifying a sordid ambition. The contest in Congress fixed his\r\nfate. Subsequent events were only consequences resulting from\r\nantecedent acts.\r\n\r\nIn the progress of this work no desire has been evinced, none is felt\r\nto screen Colonel Burr from censure where it is merited. But the man\r\nwho can read, unmoved, the evidence which has already been presented\r\nof the injustice done him in the charge of having intrigued and\r\nnegotiated with the federal party for the presidency, must possess\r\nmore of philosophic than of generous or magnanimous feelings. It would\r\nseem that the task of recording the presidential contest in Congress,\r\nin the spring of 1801, was now brought to a close. But not so. There\r\nyet remains another and imposing view to be presented. Whatever may\r\nhave been the wishes of Colonel Burr, it is certain that they were so\r\nfar under his own control as to prevent him from entering into any\r\nnegotiation, bargain, or intrigue to obtain the presidency. There is\r\nnot the slightest evidence of any such attempt on his part, while\r\nthere is strong, if not conclusive proof to the contrary. Can as much\r\nbe said in favor of his great competitor on that occasion? This is the\r\nview that remains to be taken. But, before presenting the testimony in\r\nthe case, some explanation is necessary as to the manner in which it\r\nwas first obtained and subsequently made public.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1804, a suit was instituted by Colonel Burr against James\r\nCheetham, editor of the American Citizen, for a libel, in charging him\r\nwith intriguing for the presidency. This suit was commenced by Mr.\r\nBurr with reluctance, and only to gratify personal friends. It\r\nprogressed tardily, impediments having been thrown in the way of\r\nbringing it to trial by the defendant, and probably the cause not\r\nsufficiently pressed by the complainant. In 1805 or 1806, some persons\r\nwho were really desirous of ascertaining not only the truth or falsity\r\nof the charge, but whether there was any foundation for it, determined\r\non having a _wager-suit_ placed at issue on the records of the court,\r\nand then take out a commission to examine witnesses. Accordingly, the\r\nnames of _James Gillespie_, plaintiff, and _Abraham Smith_, defendant,\r\nwere used. The latter at the time being a clerk in the store of\r\nMatthew L. Davis, then in the mercantile business, trading under the\r\nfirm of Strong & Davis.\r\n\r\nIt was universally believed, that if there were two men in Congress\r\nthat could unfold the whole negotiation if any had taken place, those\r\ntwo men were James A. Bayard, of Delaware, and Samuel Smith, of\r\nBaltimore. The former, a federal gentleman of high standing, the sole\r\nrepresentative of a state in the Congress of 1800, and thus\r\npossessing, at any moment, the power of deciding the contest in favour\r\nof Mr. Jefferson. The latter, a political and personal friend of Mr.\r\nJefferson, and the very individual whom Colonel Burr had previously\r\nselected as his proxy to declare his sentiments, in case there was a\r\ntie between Mr. Jefferson and himself. A commission was accordingly\r\ntaken out, and, on the 3d of April, 1806, Mr. Bayard and Mr. Smith\r\nwere examined. No use, however, was made of these depositions until\r\nDecember, 1830, being a period of nearly twenty-five years.\r\n\r\nOn the publication of Mr. Jefferson's writings, the sons of the late\r\nJames A. Bayard felt that the memory of their father had been\r\nwrongfully and unjustly assailed in two paragraphs in the fourth\r\nvolume of this work. The first of these paragraphs, on the 28th of\r\nJanuary, 1830, was read in the United States Senate by the Hon. Mr.\r\nClayton, of Delaware, General Samuel Smith and Edward Livingston both\r\nbeing members of the Senate and present. He read the following:\r\n\r\n\"_February 12, 1801_. Edward Livingston tells me that Bayard applied\r\nto-day or last night to General Samuel Smith, and represented to him\r\nthe expediency of coming over to the states who vote for Burr; that\r\nthere was nothing in the way of appointment which he might not\r\ncommand, and particularly mentioned the secretaryship of the navy.\r\nSmith asked him if he was authorized to make the offer. He said he was\r\nauthorized. Smith told this to Livingston and W. C. Nicholas, who\r\nconfirms it to me,\" &c.\r\n\r\nMr. Clayton then called upon the senator from Maryland (Mr. Smith) and\r\nthe senator from Louisiana (Mr. Livingston) to disprove the statement\r\nhere made by Mr. Jefferson.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith, of Maryland, rose and said \"that he had read the paragraph\r\nbefore he came here to-day, and was, therefore, aware of its import.\r\nHe had not the most distant recollection that Mr. Bayard had ever made\r\nsuch a proposition to him. Mr. Bayard, said he, and myself, though\r\npolitically opposed, were intimate personal friends, and he was an\r\nhonourable man. Of all men, Mr. Bayard would have been the last to\r\nmake such a proposition to any man; and I am confident that he had too\r\nmuch respect for me to have made it under any circumstances. I never\r\nreceived from any man any such proposition.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Livingston, of Louisiana, said, \"that as to the precise question\r\nwhich had been put to him by the senator from Delaware, he must say,\r\nthat having taxed his recollection as far as it could go on so remote\r\na transaction, he had no remembrance of it.\"\r\n\r\nThe sons of the late Mr. Bayard, not yet being satisfied as to the\r\nother paragraph, resolved on an investigation of the subject, and with\r\nthis view one of them wrote the following letter. [2]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM RICHARD H. BAYARD.\r\n\r\nWilmington, March 8, 1830.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nIn the fourth volume of Mr. Jefferson's Writings, lately published by\r\nhis grandson, page 521, under the head of a note made April 15, 1806,\r\noccurs the following paragraph, after the detail of a conversation\r\nheld with you about a month previously:--\r\n\r\n\"I did not commit these things to writing at the time, but I do now,\r\nbecause, in a suit between him and Cheetham, he has had a deposition\r\nof Mr. Bayard taken which seems to have no relation to the suit, nor\r\nto any other object than to calumniate me. Bayard pretends to have\r\naddressed to me, during the pending of the presidential election in\r\nFebruary, 1801, through General Samuel Smith, certain conditions on\r\nwhich my election might be obtained; and that General Smith, after\r\nconversing with me, gave answers from me. This is absolutely false. No\r\nproposition of any kind was ever made to me on that occasion by\r\nGeneral Smith, or any answer authorized by me. And this fact General\r\nSmith affirms at this moment.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson supposes this deposition to have been made in your suit\r\nagainst Cheetham. I have some reason to think he is mistaken as to the\r\nprecise case in which it was made. However this may be, I am anxious\r\nto procure a copy of it, as returned with the commission under which\r\nit was taken.\r\n\r\nIf I may not be considered as trespassing too far on your time and\r\nattention, will you permit me to ask whether the deposition referred\r\nto by Mr. Jefferson is still in existence? In what case it was taken?\r\nAnd whether a copy of it can be procured?\r\n\r\nI have the honour to be, respectfully,\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nRICHARD H. BAYARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO RICHARD H. BAYARD.\r\n\r\nNew-York, March 10, 1830.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI have this day received your letter of the 8th inst., containing an\r\nextract from the fourth volume of the writings of Mr. Jefferson. I\r\nhave not seen that book, and, on inquiry, do not learn that there is a\r\ncopy in this city.\r\n\r\nThe suit referred to is not that of Cheetham, but one instituted,\r\nwithout my agency or knowledge, _on a wager_. The title not now\r\nrecollected. A commission to take testimony was transmitted to me,\r\nthen at Washington, and several depositions thereupon taken; copies of\r\nall of which may, no doubt, be found among the papers of the late Mr.\r\nBayard.\r\n\r\nA gentleman well informed of these matters is now at Albany, where I\r\nexpect to meet him about the 20th inst., when it may be in my power to\r\ngive you further satisfaction on the subject of your letter.\r\n\r\nI pray in the mean time to be informed whether you are a son of the\r\nlate Mr. Bayard. Or how, if at all related to him. And what use it is\r\nproposed to make of the communications you may receive. Permit me to\r\nadd, it will at all times afford me great pleasure to gratify the\r\nfamily of Mr. Bayard on this or on any other occasion.\r\n\r\nI have the honour to be, very respectfully,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MATTHEW L. DAVIS.\r\n\r\nNew-York, March 15, 1830.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI enclose you copies of a letter from Mr. Richard H. Bayard, with my\r\nanswer, and have only to inquire whether I may refer to you to answer\r\nthis letter of Mr. Bayard; your memory being better than mine, and I\r\nnot having the depositions in question, or any copies thereof at this\r\nmoment at my command. If you should write, please to enclose your\r\nletter to me. I think it was you who got up that suit. Pray give me\r\nthe title and date.\r\n\r\nI expect to be in Albany early next week. In your answer to this, let\r\nme know where to find you. God speed you.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MATTHEW L. DAVIS.\r\n\r\nAlbany, March 18, 1830.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nThe irregularity of the mails has prevented my receiving your letter\r\nof the 15th inst., with its enclosures, until this day.\r\n\r\nI have read Mr. Bayard's letter to you under date of the 8th inst. All\r\nthe circumstances connected with the subject to which it refers are\r\nwithin my recollection; but, absent as I am from my papers, I am\r\nunwilling to speak with great confidence in relation to events which\r\nhave occurred nearly thirty years since.\r\n\r\nThe deposition of Mr. Bayard, to which I presume Mr. Jefferson alludes\r\nin his memorandum of the 15th of April, 1806, was taken, as you\r\nremark, in the case of _a wager_. The title of the cause I do not now\r\nrecollect; but Abraham Smith, a clerk in my store, was one of the\r\nparties, and I think the period was during the winter of 1805. It may\r\nhave been a year later.\r\n\r\nIn that deposition Mr. Bayard states that a negotiation in regard to\r\nthe pending election between Mr. Jefferson and Colonel Burr, in\r\nFebruary, 1801, was entered into with Mr. Jefferson, through Mr.\r\nNicholas, of Virginia, and General Samuel Smith, of Maryland; and that\r\nMr. Jefferson did agree to certain stipulations or conditions therein\r\nspecified. It is proper for me to add, that to both Robert G. Harper\r\nand General Smith the same interrogatories were propounded that were\r\nanswered by Mr. Bayard, and that the testimony (if my memory is\r\ncorrect) of Mr. Bayard was, in every material point, sustained by both\r\nthese gentlemen. These examinations were made under a commission\r\nissued out of the Supreme Court of our state.\r\n\r\nSeveral copies of these depositions were made from the originals, and\r\nI have reason to believe that one copy of them was in the possession\r\nof Mr. Bayard or Mr. Harper, and another in the possession of Stephen\r\nR. Bradley, Esq., of Vermont. They were read by different gentlemen;\r\namong them, I think, was General John P. Van Ness, of Washington city,\r\nand Rundolph Bunner, Esq., late a member of Congress from this state,\r\nwho, I have no doubt, can and would, if asked, detail their contents.\r\nI should suppose that General Smith would not only recollect the\r\noccurrences in February, 1801, but the contents also of the deposition\r\nto which he has sworn.\r\n\r\nDuring the contest I was the advocate of Mr. Jefferson's election, and\r\ncorresponded with different members of Congress; among the number were\r\nEdward Livingston and Albert Gallatin, Esquires. The letters I then\r\nreceived enumerated not only the _doubtful states_, but the _doubtful\r\nmen_ of both parties which were in Congress. These letters have been\r\ncarefully preserved.\r\n\r\nIt is due to the character of the late Mr. Bayard to remark, that, so\r\nfar as the circumstances have come to my knowledge, there was nothing\r\nin the transaction calculated in the slightest degree to impeach his\r\nfidelity to his party or his honour. The object of the negotiation was\r\nnot to aggrandize or to elevate himself or his friends, but to secure\r\nand perpetuate certain cardinal points of federal policy.\r\n\r\nI have not seen the works of Mr. Jefferson, but I will obtain and\r\nexamine them with care and attention. The history of the times to\r\nwhich these memorandums and documents relate are enveloped in thick\r\ndarkness. Whether the period has yet arrived when an effort should be\r\nmade to dispel that darkness is problematical. The means, however, do\r\nexist of proving, to the satisfaction of the most skeptical, what are\r\nthe facts in the case; and, consequently, of doing full justice to all\r\nthe parties concerned; and that duty, however unpleasant, shall, at a\r\nproper crisis, be fairly, impartially, and fearlessly performed.\r\n\r\nAt my advanced age I do not wish to be drawn into newspaper\r\ncontroversies; nor can I be induced, prematurely, to make any\r\npublication on the subject alluded to in this letter. At the same\r\ntime, you are at liberty to communicate the whole or any part of its\r\ncontents to Mr. Bayard, in the expectation that it will be used\r\ndiscreetly.\r\n\r\nRespectfully, your friend,\r\n\r\nM. L. DAVIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL SAMUEL SMITH TO RICHARD H. BAYARD AND JAMES A. BAYARD.\r\n\r\nWashington, April 3, 1830.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,\r\n\r\nIll health, and disinclination to go back to circumstances which\r\nhappened thirty years past, has prevented an earlier answer to your\r\nletter. In the extract you have sent me from Mr. Jefferson's writings,\r\nit is said--\"Bayard\" (alluding to his deposition) \"pretends to have\r\naddressed to me, during the pending of the presidential election in\r\nFebruary, 1801, through General Smith, certain conditions on which my\r\nelection might be obtained, and that General Smith, after conversing\r\nwith me, gave answer for me. This is absolutely false. No proposition\r\nof any kind ever was made to me on that occasion by General Smith, or\r\nany answer authorized by me; and the fact General Smith affirms at\r\nthis moment\"--to wit, 15th of April, 1806. Yes, gentlemen, it was (I\r\nbelieve) on that day I put into the hands of Mr. Jefferson a press\r\ncopy of _my deposition in the case of Cheetham_, [3] in which _I\r\nperfectly recollect that I deny having ever received from Mr.\r\nJefferson any proposition of any kind to be made by me to Mr. Bayard\r\nor any other person. Not, perhaps, in those words, but in detail to\r\nthat effect_; or having ever communicated any proposition of the kind\r\nas from Mr. Jefferson to Mr. Bayard.\r\n\r\nMy experience in life has shown that few men take advice unless it\r\ncomports with their own views. I will, however, recommend that you let\r\nwell enough alone. Your father was a bitter, most bitter enemy of Mr.\r\nJefferson; his enmity was known to all, and, I presume, to Mr.\r\nJefferson; it was therefore very natural for him to conclude that the\r\nsuit of Cheetham had been got up for the express purpose of obtaining\r\nthe oath of your father with the view of injuring him, and that your\r\nfather had advised such a course. _My recollection of what passed on\r\nthe occasion is as strong as if it had happened yesterday_. I will\r\ngive you a detail in as few words as possible.\r\n\r\nTwo or three days before the election was terminated, a member, who I\r\nsuppose had been deputed by the federal party, called on me to\r\nconverse on the subject. I held little conversation with _him_. Your\r\nfather then called on me, and said that he was anxious to put an end\r\nto the controversy; that, in case of dissolution, Delaware never could\r\nexpect to obtain her present advantages; that, if satisfied on certain\r\npoints, he would terminate the contest. He then went on to state those\r\npoints: they were three or four. I can now remember only _three_, to\r\nwit--the funding system, the navy, and the retaining or dismissal of\r\nfederalists then in office. I answered promptly that I could satisfy\r\nhim fully on two of the points (which two I do not now recollect), for\r\nthat I had had frequent conversations with him on them, and I stated\r\nwhat I understood and believed to be his opinions, and what I thought\r\nwould be his rule of conduct; with which explanation your father\r\nexpressed his entire satisfaction, and on the third requested that I\r\nwould inform myself.\r\n\r\nI lodged with Mr. Jefferson, and that night had a conversation with\r\nhim, _without his having the remotest idea of my object_. Mr.\r\nJefferson was a gentleman of _extreme frankness_ with his friends; he\r\nconversed freely and frankly with them on all subjects, and gave his\r\nopinions without reserve. Some of them thought that he did so too\r\nfreely. Satisfied with his opinion on the third point, I communicated\r\nto your father the next day--that, from the conversation that I had\r\nhad with Mr. Jefferson, I was satisfied in _my own mind_ that his\r\nconduct on that point would be so and so. But I certainly never did\r\ntell your father that I had any authority from Mr. Jefferson to\r\ncommunicate any thing to him or to any other person.\r\n\r\nDuring the session of Congress of 1805-6, your father told me that a\r\nlittle lawyer in Delaware had (he supposed at the instance of Colonel\r\nBurr) endeavoured to get from him a deposition touching a conversation\r\nwith me; that he had refused it; that Burr had, however, trumped up a\r\nsuit for the sole purpose of coercing his deposition and mine, and\r\nsaid that a commission to take testimony was now in the city, and that\r\nhe apprized me that I might be prepared. I asked him what he would\r\nstate in his deposition. He answered similar to the quotation you have\r\nsent. I told him instantly that I had communicated to him my _own\r\nopinion_, [4] derived from conversation with Mr. Jefferson, and not\r\none word from him to your father; and that my testimony would, as to\r\nthat point, be in direct hostility. He then said, the little fellow\r\nwill have our testimony by some means or other, and I will give mine.\r\nI answered that I would also. A few nights afterward Colonel Burr\r\ncalled on me. I told him that I had written my deposition, and would\r\nhave a fair copy made of it. He said, trust it to me, and I will get\r\nMr. ----- to copy it. I did so, and, on his returning it to me, I\r\nfound words not mine interpolated in the copy. I struck out those\r\nwords, had it copied again, and, to prevent all plea of false copying,\r\nI had a press copy taken of it. When I appeared before the commission,\r\nI found a deposition attached to that of your father, and asked how\r\nthey came by that. They answered that it had been sent to them. I\r\nrequested them to take it off; that I had the deposition in my hand to\r\nwhich alone I would swear; they did so, and my deposition was\r\nattached. The next day (I think) I called, and told Mr. Jefferson what\r\nhad passed, read to him the press copy, and asked him if he\r\nrecollected having given to me the opinions I had detailed. He\r\nanswered that he did not, but it might be so, for that they were\r\nopinions he held and expressed to many of his friends, and as probably\r\nto me as any other, and then said that he would wish to have a copy. I\r\ntold him that I had no use for it; he might, and I gave him the press\r\ncopy.\r\n\r\nYou have now a tolerable full view of the case, and will see that no\r\npossible censure can attach to Mr. Jefferson; that a diversity of\r\nopinion will arise from publication as to your father's credibility or\r\nmine, and that both may suffer in the Public estimation. I will\r\nconclude that, during my long life, I have scarcely ever known an\r\ninstance of newspaper publication between A. and B. that some obloquy\r\ndid not attach to both parties.\r\n\r\nI am, gentlemen, with respect,\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nS. SMITH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM RICHARD H. BAYARD.\r\n\r\nWilmington, Delaware, April 22, 1830.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI have just received your letter of the 10th ult., in answer to mine\r\nof the 8th, the reason of which delay is to be found in the fact of\r\nyour having directed it to Wilmington, North Carolina. It was\r\naccordingly conveyed to that place, and was returned and received by\r\nme this morning.\r\n\r\nI reply to your inquiries that I am the eldest son of the late James\r\nA. Bayard, and that the object which I have in view is the vindication\r\nof his character from the aspersion contained in the passage in Mr.\r\nJefferson's writings, a copy of which I sent you.\r\n\r\nIt is true that among my father's papers I have found rough copies of\r\nthe deposition made in your suit against Cheetham, as well as of that\r\nmade in the wager case. Together with the first-named deposition there\r\nis also a copy of the interrogatories; but, in the latter case, simply\r\na rough copy of the deposition, without title, or any memorandum of\r\nthe names of the parties. You will perceive at once the necessity of\r\naccompanying the deposition in the wager case with its _title_ and a\r\ncopy of the interrogatories, in order to show, in the first place, Mr.\r\nJefferson's error in the statement of the case, and, secondly, to\r\nrefute his assertion that the deposition had \"nothing to do with the\r\nsuit, or with any other object than to calumniate him.\"\r\n\r\nThe subsequent part of his statement will be met by the deposition\r\nitself, by reference to concomitant circumstances, and such\r\ncorroborating testimony as time has spared. Being anxious to avoid all\r\nroom for cavil, by publishing the depositions as returned with the\r\nrespective commissions, lest, perchance, there should be some slight\r\nverbal inaccuracies, I applied to you, believing it was in your power\r\nto give the information necessary to enable me to procure certified\r\ncopies of the record.\r\n\r\nYou have thus, Sir, an entire exposition of my motives for addressing\r\nyou my letter of the 8th ult.; and, in conformity with the sentiment\r\nyou are so good as to express in the conclusion of your letter, I\r\ndoubt not you will furnish me with such information as you possess on\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nI wrote some time since to Mr. Edward N. Rogers, of your city, to\r\nprocure for me copies of my father's and General Samuel Smith's\r\ndepositions in _both_ cases. He informs me, by his letter of the 17th\r\ninst., that the depositions in your suit against Cheetham are not to\r\nbe found in the office; that the case went off by default, and he\r\nsupposes they were never filed. At all events, the clerk cannot now\r\nfind them.\r\n\r\nYou will probably be able to state what became of them, and whether\r\ncopies can be procured. I will ask of you, therefore, the favour to\r\ncommunicate to him information on this point, as well as the _name_ of\r\nthe _wager case_, that he may be enabled to comply with my request,\r\nwith the execution of which he has been so kind as to charge himself.\r\n\r\nI have the honour to be, respectfully,\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nRICHARD H. BAYARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n1. See Ch. V.\r\n\r\n2. It is considered proper to state here that the correspondence which\r\nfollows is published without the privity or consent of either of the\r\nMr. Bayards. It is found among the papers of Colonel Burr, and is\r\nintimately connected with a history of the transaction.\r\n\r\n3. The suit was James Gillespie _vs_. Abraham Smith. See deposition.\r\n\r\n4. Will the reader examine the deposition, especially what relates to\r\nMr. McLean and Mr. Latimer?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe necessary information having been given to Mr. Bayard to enable\r\nhim to procure the depositions of his father and General Smith, they\r\nwere accordingly obtained from Mr. Bradley, of Vermont. Before\r\npresenting them, it may not be improper to give the letters of two\r\nmembers of Congress, one of which enters somewhat into a history of\r\nthe case, and _both_ of which negatives, in the most positive manner,\r\nany attempt of Colonel Burr, or any person acting in his behalf, to\r\nnegotiate, bargain, or intrigue with the federal party for the office\r\nof president.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM COOPER TO THOMAS MORRIS. [1]\r\n\r\nWashington, February 10, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nWe have this day locked ourselves up by a rule to proceed to choose a\r\npresident before we adjourn. * * * * * * * We shall run Burr\r\nperseveringly. You shall hear of the result instantly after the fact\r\nis ascertained. _A little good management would have secured our\r\nobject on the first vote_, but now it is too late for any operations\r\nto be gone into, except that of adhering to Burr, and leave the\r\nconsequences to those who have heretofore been his friends. If we\r\nsucceed, a faithful support must, on our part, be given to his\r\nadministration, which, I hope, will be wise and energetic.\r\n\r\nYour friend,\r\n\r\nW. COOPER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM COOPER TO THOMAS MORRIS.\r\n\r\nFebruary 13, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nWe have postponed, until to-morrow 11 o'clock, the voting for\r\npresident. All stand firm. Jefferson eight--Burr six--divided two.\r\n_Had Burr done any thing for himself, he would long ere this have been\r\npresident._ If a majority would answer, he would have it on every\r\nvote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM JAMES A. BAYARD TO ALEXANDER HAMILTON.\r\n\r\nWashington, January 7, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI have been but a few days in this city; but, since my arrival, have\r\nhad the pleasure to receive the letter which you did me the honour to\r\nwrite on the 27th ult. I am fully sensible of the great importance of\r\nthe subject to which it relates, and am, therefore, extremely obliged\r\nby the information you have been so good as to communicate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is considered that at least, in the first instance, Georgia, North\r\nCarolina, Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, New-Jersey, and\r\nNew-York will vote for Mr. Jefferson. It is probable that Maryland and\r\nVermont will be divided. It is therefore counted, that upon the first\r\nballot it would be possible to give to Mr. Burr six votes. It is\r\ncalculated, however, and strongly insisted by some gentlemen, that a\r\npersevering opposition to Mr. Jefferson would bring over _New-York,\r\nNew-Jersey, and Maryland._ What is the probability relative to\r\nNew-York?--your means enable you to form the most correct opinion. As\r\nto New-Jersey and Maryland, it would depend on Mr. Linn of the former\r\nand Mr. Dent of the latter state.\r\n\r\nI assure you, sir, there appears to be a strong inclination in a\r\nmajority of the federal party to support Mr. Burr. The current has\r\nalready acquired considerable force, and is manifestly increasing. The\r\nvote which the representation of a state enables me to give would\r\ndecide the question in favour of Mr. Jefferson. At present I am by no\r\nmeans decided as to the object of preference. If the federal party\r\nshould take up Mr. Burr, I ought certainly to be impressed with the\r\nmost undoubting conviction before I separated myself from them. I\r\ncannot, however, deny that there are strong considerations which give\r\na preference to Mr. Jefferson. The subject admits of many and very\r\ndoubtful views; and, before I resolve on the part I shall take, I will\r\nawait the approach of the crisis, which may probably bring with it\r\ncircumstances decisive of the event.\r\n\r\nThe federal party meet on Friday for the purpose of forming a\r\nresolution as to their line of conduct. I have not the least doubt of\r\ntheir agreeing to support Colonel Burr. Their determination will not\r\nbind me; for though it might cost me a painful struggle to disappoint\r\nthe views and wishes of many gentlemen with whom I have been\r\naccustomed to act, yet the magnitude of the subject forbids the\r\nsacrifice of a strong conviction.\r\n\r\nI cannot answer for the coherence of my letter, as I have undertaken\r\nto write to you from the chamber of representatives, with an attention\r\ndivided by the debate which occupies the house. I have not considered\r\nmyself at liberty to show your letter to any one, though I think it\r\nwould be serviceable, if you could trust my discretion in the\r\ncommunication of it.\r\n\r\nWith great consideration,\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJAMES A. BAYARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE BAER TO RICHARD H. BAYARD.\r\n\r\nFrederick, April 19, 1830\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nIn compliance with your request, I now communicate to you my\r\nrecollections of the events of the presidential election by the House\r\nof Representatives in 1801. There has been no period of our political\r\nhistory more misunderstood and more grossly misrepresented. The course\r\nadopted by the federal party was one of principle, and not of faction;\r\nand I think the present a suitable occasion for explaining the views\r\nand motives at least of those gentlemen who, having it in their power\r\nto decide the election at any moment, were induced to protract it for\r\na time, but ultimately to withdraw their opposition to Mr. Jefferson.\r\n\r\nI have no hesitation in saying that the facts stated in the deposition\r\nof your father, the late James A. Bayard, so far as they came to my\r\nknowledge, are substantially correct; and although nearly thirty years\r\nhave elapsed since that eventful period, my recollection is vivid as\r\nto the principal circumstances, which, from the part I was called upon\r\nto act, were deeply graven on my memory. As soon as it was generally\r\nknown that the two democratic candidates, Jefferson and Burr, had the\r\nhighest and an equal number of votes, and that the election would\r\nconsequently devolve on the House of Representatives, Mr. Dent, who\r\nhad hitherto acted with the federal party, declared his intention to\r\nvote for Mr. Jefferson, in consequence of which determination the vote\r\nof Maryland was divided.\r\n\r\nIt was soon ascertained that there were six individuals, the vote of\r\nany one of whom could at any moment decide the election. These were,\r\nyour father, the late James A. Bayard, who held the vote of the state\r\nof Delaware; General Morris, of Vermont, who held the divided vote of\r\nthat state; and Mr. Craik, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Dennis, and myself, who\r\nheld the divided vote of Maryland. Much anxiety was shown by the\r\nfriends of Mr. Jefferson, and much ingenuity used to discover the line\r\nof conduct which would be pursued by them. Deeply impressed with the\r\nresponsibility which attached to their peculiar situation, and\r\nconscious that the American people looked to them for a president,\r\nthey could not rashly determine either to surrender their\r\nconstitutional discretion, or disappoint the expectations of their\r\nfellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nYour father, Mr. Craik, and myself having compared ideas upon the\r\nsubject, and finding that we entertained the same views and opinions,\r\nresolved to act together, and accordingly entered into a solemn and\r\nmutual pledge that we would in the first instance yield to the wishes\r\nof the great majority of the party with whom we acted, and vote for\r\nMr. Burr, but that no consideration should induce us to protract the\r\ncontest beyond a reasonable period for the purpose of ascertaining\r\nwhether he could be elected. We determined that a president should be\r\nchosen, but were willing thus far to defer to the opinions of our\r\npolitical friends, whose preference of Mr. Burr was founded upon a\r\nbelief that he was less hostile to federal men and federal measures\r\nthan Mr. Jefferson. General Morris and Mr. Dennis concurred in this\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nThe views by which the federal party were governed were these:--They\r\nheld that the Constitution had vested in the House of Representatives\r\na high discretion in a case like the present, to be exercised for the\r\nbenefit of the nation; and that, in the execution of this delegated\r\npower, an honest and unbiased judgment was the measure of their\r\nresponsibility. They were less certain of the hostility of Mr. Burr to\r\nfederal policy than of that of Mr. Jefferson, which was known and\r\ndecided. Mr. Jefferson had identified himself with, and was at the\r\nhead of the party in Congress who had opposed every measure deemed\r\nnecessary by the federalists for putting the country in a posture of\r\ndefence; such as fortifying the harbours and seaports, establishing\r\nmanufactories of arms; erecting arsenals, and filling them with arms\r\nand ammunition; erecting a navy for the defence of commerce, &c. His\r\nspeculative opinions were known to be hostile to the independence of\r\nthe judiciary, to the financial system of the country, and to internal\r\nimprovements. All these matters the federalists believed to be\r\nintimately blended with the prosperity of the nation, and they\r\ndeprecated, therefore, the elevation of a man to the head of the\r\ngovernment whose hostility to them was open and avowed. It was feared,\r\ntoo, from his prejudices against the party which supported them, that\r\nhe would dismiss all public officers who differed with him in\r\nsentiment, without regard to their qualifications and honesty, but on\r\nthe ground only of political character. The House of Representatives\r\nadopted certain resolutions for their government during the election,\r\none of which was that there should be no adjournment till it was\r\ndecided.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th February, 1801, being the day appointed by law for\r\ncounting the votes of the electoral colleges, the House of\r\nRepresentatives proceeded in a body to the Senate chamber, where the\r\nvice-president, in view of both houses of Congress, opened the\r\ncertificates of the electors of the different states; and, as the\r\nvotes were read, the tellers on the part of each house counted and\r\ntook lists of them, which, being compared and delivered to him, he\r\nannounced to both houses the state of the votes; which was, for Thomas\r\nJefferson 73 votes, for Aaron Burr 73 votes, for John Adams 65 votes,\r\nfor Charles Pinckney 64 votes, for John Jay one vote; and then\r\ndeclared that the greatest number and majority of votes being equal,\r\nthe choice had devolved on the House of Representatives. The members\r\nof the house then withdrew to their own chamber, and proceeded to\r\nballot for a president. On the first ballot it was found that Thomas\r\nJefferson had the votes of eight states, Aaron Burr of six states, and\r\nthat two were divided. As there were sixteen states, and a majority\r\nwas necessary to determine the election, Mr. Jefferson wanted the vote\r\nof one state. Thus the result which had been anticipated was realized.\r\n\r\nThe balloting continued throughout that day and the following night,\r\nat short intervals, with the same result, the 26th ballot being taken\r\nat 8 o'clock on the morning of the 12th of February. The balloting\r\ncontinued with the same result from day to day till the 17th of\r\nFebruary, without any adjournment of the house. On the previous day\r\n(February 16), a consultation was held by the gentlemen I have\r\nmentioned, when, being satisfied that Mr. Burr could not be elected,\r\nas no change had taken place in his favour, and there was no evidence\r\nof any effort on the part of himself or his personal friends to\r\nprocure his election, it was resolved to abandon the contest. This\r\ndetermination was made known to the federal members generally, and\r\nexcited some discontent among the violent of the party, who thought it\r\nbetter to go without a president than to elect Mr. Jefferson. A\r\ngeneral meeting, however, of the federal members was called, and the\r\nsubject explained, when it was admitted that Mr. Burr could not be\r\nelected. A few individuals persisted in their resolution not to vote\r\nfor Mr. Jefferson, but the great majority wished the election\r\nterminated and a president chosen. _Having also received assurances\r\nfrom a source on which we placed reliance that our wishes with regard\r\nto certain points of federal policy in which we felt a deep interest\r\nwould be observed in case Mr. Jefferson was elected_, the opposition\r\nof Vermont, Delaware, and Maryland was withdrawn, and on the 36th\r\nballot your father, the late James A. Bayard, put in a blank ballot,\r\nmyself and my colleagues did the same, and General Morris absented\r\nhimself. The South Carolina federalists also put in blank ballots.\r\nThus terminated that memorable contest.\r\n\r\nPrevious to and pending the election, rumours were industriously\r\ncirculated, and letters written to different parts of the country,\r\ncharging the federalists with the design to prevent the election of a\r\npresident, and to usurp the government by an act of legislative power.\r\nGreat anxiety and apprehensions were created in the minds of all, and\r\nof none more than the federalists generally, who were not apprized of\r\nthe determination of those gentlemen who held the power, and were\r\nresolved to terminate the contest when the proper period arrived. But\r\nneither these rumours, nor the excitement produced by them, nor the\r\nthreats made by their opponents to resist by force such a measure, had\r\nthe least influence on the conduct of those gentlemen. They knew the\r\npower which they possessed, and were conscious of the uprightness of\r\ntheir views, and of the safety and constitutional character of the\r\ncourse they had adopted. I was privy to all the arrangements made, and\r\nattended all the meetings of the federal party when consulting on the\r\ncourse to be pursued in relation to the election; and I pledge my most\r\nsolemn asseveration that no such measure was ever for a moment\r\ncontemplated by that party; that no such proposition was ever made;\r\nand that, if it had ever been, it would not only have been\r\ndiscouraged, but instantly put down by those gentlemen who possessed\r\nthe power, and were pledged to each other to elect a president before\r\nthe close of the session.\r\n\r\nI am respectfully, Sir,\r\n\r\nYour most obedient servant,\r\n\r\nGEORGE BAER.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERROGATORIES to be administered to James A. Bayard, Esq., of the\r\nstate of Delaware, late a member of Congress for the United States\r\nfrom the said state of Delaware, a witness to be produced, sworn, and\r\nexamined in a cause now depending in the Supreme Court of Judicature\r\nof the state of New-York, between Aaron Burr, plaintiff, and James\r\nCheetham, defendant, on the part of the defendant.\r\n\r\n1st. Do you know the parties, plaintiff and defendant, or either and\r\nwhich of them, and how long have you known them respectively?\r\n\r\n2d. Were you a member of the House of Representatives, in Congress of\r\nthe United States, from the state of Delaware, in the sessions holden\r\nin the months of January and February, in the year 1801?\r\n\r\n3d. Was there not an equal number of votes for Thomas Jefferson and\r\nAaron Burr, as president and vice-president of the said United States,\r\nat the election for those officers in the December preceding, and did\r\nnot the choice of a president consequently devolve on the said House\r\nof Representatives?\r\n\r\n4th. Did not the said house ballot for the president several times\r\nbefore a choice was made? if so, how many times? Was not the frequency\r\nof balloting occasioned by an attempt on the part of several members\r\nof Congress to elect the said plaintiff, Aaron Burr, as president? Do\r\nyou know who such members were? if so, what were their names?\r\n\r\n5th. Do you know that any measures were suggested or pursued by any\r\nperson or persons to secure the election of Aaron Burr to the\r\npresidency? if so, who were such person or persons? Did _he_, the said\r\nAaron Burr, know thereof? Were there any letter or letters written\r\ncommunicating such an intention? if so, were such letter or letters\r\nforwarded to him through the postoffice by any person, and who? Has he\r\nnot informed you, or have you not understood (and if so, how?) that he\r\nwas apprized that an attempt would be made to secure his election?\r\n\r\n6th. Did he or any other person (and if so, who?) ever communicate to\r\nyou, by writing or otherwise, or to any other person or persons to\r\nyour knowledge, that any measure had been suggested or would be\r\npursued to secure his election? When were these communications made?\r\n\r\n7th. Had not some of the federal members of Congress a meeting at\r\nWashington, in the month of December, 1800, or of January or of\r\nFebruary, 1801, at which it was determined to support Aaron Burr for\r\nthe presidency? Or if there were any meeting or meetings to your\r\nknowledge, in respect to the ensuing election for a president of the\r\nUnited States in the said House of Representatives, what was advised\r\nor concluded upon, to the best of your remembrance or belief? Was not\r\nDavid A. Ogden, of the city of New-York, attorney at law, authorized\r\nor requested by you, or some other member or members of Congress, or\r\nsome other person, and who in particular, to call upon the plaintiff\r\nand inquire of him--\r\n\r\n1st. What conduct he would pursue in respect to certain cardinal\r\npoints of federal policy?\r\n\r\n2d. What co-operation or aid the plaintiff could or would afford\r\ntowards securing his own election to the presidency? or if you or some\r\nother person did not authorize or request the said David A. Ogden to\r\nmake such communication to the plaintiff in exact terms, what, in\r\nsubstance, was such authority or request? Do you know, or were you\r\ninformed by the said David A. Ogden or otherwise, that he or any other\r\nperson had made the said communication to the plaintiff, or the same\r\nin substance? Do you know, or have you been informed (and if so, how?)\r\nthat the plaintiff declared, as to the first question, it would not be\r\nexpedient to enter into explanations, or words to that effect? That,\r\nas to the second question, New-York and Tennessee would vote for him\r\non a second ballot, and New-Jersey might be induced to do the same, or\r\nwords to that effect? Did you ever communicate with the plaintiff, or\r\nhe with you, on the subject? Do you know any person who did\r\ncommunicate with him? and if so, what did he say?\r\n\r\nDid you not receive a letter or letters from Alexander Hamilton, of\r\nNew-York, and late Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, now\r\ndeceased, in the month of January or February, 1801, or at some other\r\ntime, and when, respecting the election of a president of the United\r\nStates? Did he not communicate to you that the said David A. Ogden had\r\nbeen requested to see the plaintiff for the purposes aforesaid? And\r\nwhat in particular were the contents of such letters or letter, or\r\ncommunication? Do you know that any, and if so, what measures were\r\nsuggested or pursued to secure the election of said plaintiff as\r\npresident; and did the said plaintiff know, or was he informed\r\nthereof, or what did he know, or of what was he informed? Had you any\r\nreason or reasons to believe that any of the states would relinquish\r\nThomas Jefferson and vote for Aaron Burr as president in the said\r\nelection in the said House of Representatives, or that the said Aaron\r\nBurr calculated on such relinquishment? If so, which state or states,\r\nand what was the reason or reasons of such belief?\r\n\r\n8th. Do you know any matter, circumstance, or thing which can be\r\nmaterial to the defendant in this cause? If yea, set the same forth\r\nfully and particularly.\r\n\r\n_Interrogatory on the part of the plaintiff_.--Do you know of any\r\nmatter or thing that may be beneficial to the plaintiff on the trial\r\nof this cause? If so, declare the same fully and at length, in the\r\nsame manner as if you had been particularly interrogated thereto.\r\n\r\nMiller & Van Wyck, Attorneys for Defendant.\r\n\r\nApproved, March 6, 1805.\r\n\r\nB. Livingston.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe deposition of James A. Bayard, sworn and examined on the twenty\r\n---- day of ----, in the year of our Lord 1805, at Wilmington, in the\r\nstate of Delaware, by virtue of a commission issuing out of the\r\nSupreme Court of Judicature of the state of New-York, to John Vaughan,\r\n---- or any two of them, directed for the examination of the said\r\nJames A. Bayard, in a cause there depending between Aaron Burr,\r\nplaintiff, and James Cheetham, defendant, on the part and behalf of\r\nthe defendant.\r\n\r\n1st. To the first interrogatory this deponent answers and says, As a\r\nmember of the House of Representatives, I paid a visit of ceremony to\r\nthe plaintiff on the fourth of March, in the year 1801, and was\r\nintroduced to him. I had no acquaintance with him before that period.\r\nI had no knowledge of the defendant but what was derived from his\r\ngeneral reputation before the last session of Congress, when a\r\npersonal acquaintance commenced upon my becoming a member of the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\n2d. To the second interrogatory, this deponent saith, I was.\r\n\r\n3d. To the third interrogatory this deponent saith, There was an\r\nequality of electoral votes for Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Burr, and the\r\nchoice of one of them did, of consequence, devolve on the House of\r\nRepresentatives.\r\n\r\n4th. To the fourth interrogatory this deponent saith, The house\r\nresolved into states, balloted for a president a number of times, the\r\nexact number is not at present in my recollection, before a choice was\r\nmade. The frequency of balloting was occasioned by the preference\r\ngiven by the federal side of the house to Mr. Burr. With the exception\r\nof Mr. Huger, of South Carolina, I recollect no federal member who did\r\nnot concur in the general course of balloting for Mr. Burr. I cannot\r\nname each member. The federal members at that time composed a majority\r\nof the house, though not of the states. Their names can be ascertained\r\nby the journals of the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\n5th. To the fifth interrogatory this deponent saith, I know of no\r\nmeasures but those of argument and persuasion which were used to\r\nsecure the election of Mr. Burr to the presidency. Several gentlemen\r\nof the federal party doubted the practicability of electing Mr. Burr,\r\nand the policy of attempting it. Before the election came on there\r\nwere several meetings of the party to consider the subject. It was\r\nfrequently debated, and most of the gentlemen who had adopted a\r\ndecided opinion in favour of his election employed their influence and\r\naddress to convince those who doubted of the propriety of the measure.\r\nI cannot tell whether Mr. Burr was acquainted with what passed at our\r\nmeetings. But I neither knew nor heard of any letter being written to\r\nhim on the subject. He never informed me, nor have I reason to\r\nbelieve, further than inference, from the open professions and public\r\ncourse pursued by the federal party, that he was apprized that an\r\nattempt would be made to secure his election.\r\n\r\n6th. To the sixth interrogatory the deponent saith, Mr. Burr, or any\r\nperson on his behalf, never did communicate to me in writing or\r\notherwise, or to any other persons of which I have any knowledge, that\r\nany measures had been suggested or would be pursued to secure his\r\nelection. Preceding the day of the election, in the course of the\r\nsession, the federal members of Congress had a number of general\r\nmeetings, the professed and sole purpose of which was to consider the\r\npropriety of giving their support to the election of Mr. Burr. The\r\ngeneral sentiment of the party was strongly in his favour. Mr. Huger,\r\nI think, could not be brought to vote for him. Mr. Craik and Mr. Baer,\r\nof Maryland, and myself, were those who acquiesced with the greatest\r\ndifficulty and hesitation. I did not believe Mr. Burr could be\r\nelected, and thought it vain to make the attempt; but I was chiefly\r\ninfluenced by the current of public sentiment, which I thought it\r\nneither safe nor politic to counteract. It was, however, determined by\r\nthe party, without consulting Mr. Burr, to make the experiment whether\r\nhe could be elected. Mr. Ogden never was authorized or requested by\r\nme, nor any member of the house to my knowledge, to call upon Mr.\r\nBurr, and to make any propositions to him of any kind or nature. I\r\nremember Mr. Ogden's being at Washington while the election was\r\ndepending. I spent one or two evenings in his company at Stiller's\r\nhotel, in small parties, and we recalled an acquaintance of very early\r\nlife, which had been suspended by a separation of eighteen or twenty\r\nyears. I spent not a moment with Mr. Ogden in private. It was reported\r\nthat he was an agent for Mr. Burr, or it was understood that he was in\r\npossession of declarations of Mr. Burr that he would serve as\r\npresident if elected. I never questioned him on the subject. Although\r\nI considered Mr. Burr personally better qualified to fill the office\r\nof president than Mr. Jefferson, yet, for a reason above suggested, I\r\nfelt no anxiety for his election, and I presumed if Mr. Ogden came on\r\nany errand from Mr. Burr, or was desirous of making any disclosures\r\nrelative to his election, he would do it without any application from\r\nme. But Mr. Ogden or any other person never did make any communication\r\nto me from Mr. Burr, nor do I remember having any conversation with\r\nhim relative to the election. I never had any communication, directly\r\nor indirectly, with Mr. Burr in relation to his election to the\r\npresidency. I was one of those who thought from the beginning that the\r\nelection of Mr. Burr was not practicable. The sentiment was frequently\r\nand openly expressed. I remember it was generally said by those who\r\nwished a perseverance in the opposition to Mr. Jefferson, that several\r\ndemocratic states were more disposed to vote for Mr. Burr than for Mr.\r\nJefferson; that, out of complaisance to the known intention of the\r\nparty, they would vote a decent length of time for Mr. Jefferson, and,\r\nas soon as they could excuse themselves by the imperious situation of\r\naffairs, would give their votes for Mr. Burr, the man they really\r\npreferred. The states relied upon for this change were New-York,\r\nNew-Jersey, Vermont, and Tennessee. I never, however, understood that\r\nany assurance to this effect came from Mr. Burr. Early in the election\r\nit was reported that Mr. Edward Livingston, the representative of the\r\ncity of New-York, was the confidential agent for Mr. Burr, and that\r\nMr. Burr had committed himself entirely to the discretion of Mr.\r\nLivingston, having agreed to adopt all his acts. I took an occasion to\r\nsound Mr. Livingston on the subject, and intimated that, having it in\r\nmy power to terminate the contest, I should do so, unless he could\r\ngive me some assurance that we might calculate upon a change in the\r\nvotes of some of the members of his party. Mr. Livingston stated that\r\nhe felt no great concern as to the event of the election, but he\r\ndisclaimed any agency from Mr. Burr, or any connexion with him on the\r\nsubject, and any knowledge of Mr. Burr's designing to co-operate in\r\nsupport of his election.\r\n\r\n7th. The deponent, answering that part of the seventh interrogatory\r\nwhich relates to letters received from the late Alexander Hamilton,\r\nsays, I did receive, in the course of the winter of 1801, several\r\nletters from General Hamilton on the subject of the election, but the\r\nname of David A. Ogden is not mentioned in any of them. The general\r\ndesign and effect of these letters was to persuade me to vote for Mr.\r\nJefferson, and not for Mr. Burr. The letters contain very strong\r\nreasons; and a very earnest opinion against the election of Mr. Burr.\r\nIn answer to the residue of the same interrogatory, the deponent\r\nsaith, I repeat that I know of no means used to promote the election\r\nof Mr. Burr but persuasion. I am wholly ignorant of what the plaintiff\r\nwas apprized of in relation to the election, as I had no communication\r\nwith him directly or indirectly; and as to the expectation of a change\r\nof votes from Mr. Jefferson to Mr. Burr, I never knew a better ground\r\nfor it than the opinions and calculations of a number of members.\r\n\r\n8th. In answer to the eighth interrogatory the deponent saith, I know\r\nof nothing which, in my opinion, can be of service to the defendant in\r\nthe cause.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the interrogatory on the part of the plaintiff the deponent\r\nanswers, Having yielded, with Messrs. Craik and Baer, of Maryland, to\r\nthe strong desire of the great body of the party with whom we usually\r\nacted, and agreed to vote for Mr. Burr, and those gentlemen and myself\r\nbeing governed by the same views and motives, we pledged ourselves to\r\neach other to pursue the same line of conduct and act together. We\r\nfelt that _some concession_ was due to the judgment of the great\r\nmajority of our political friends who differed with us in opinion, but\r\nwe determined that no consideration should make us lose sight for a\r\nmoment of the necessity of a president being chosen. We therefore\r\nresolved, that as soon as it was fairly ascertained that Mr. Burr\r\ncould not be elected, to give our votes to Mr. Jefferson. General\r\nMorris, of Vermont, shortly after acceded to this arrangement. The\r\nresult of the ballot of the states had uniformly been eight states for\r\nMr. Jefferson, six for Mr. Burr, and two divided. Mr. Jefferson wanted\r\nthe vote of one state only; those three gentlemen belonged to the\r\ndivided states; I held the vote of the state of Delaware; it was\r\ntherefore in the power of either of us to terminate the election.\r\nThese gentlemen, knowing the strong interest of my state to have a\r\npresident, and knowing the sincerity of my determination to make one,\r\nleft it to me to fix the time when the opposition should cease, and to\r\nmake terms, if any could be accomplished, with the friends of Mr.\r\nJefferson. I took pains to disclose this state of things in such a\r\nmanner that it might be known to the friends of Mr. Burr, and to those\r\ngentlemen who were believed to be most disposed to change their votes\r\nin his favour. I repeatedly stated to many gentlemen with whom I was\r\nacting that it was a vain thing to protract the election, as it had\r\nbecome manifest that Mr. Burr would not assist us, and as we could do\r\nnothing without his aid. I expected, under these circumstances, if\r\nthere were any latent engines at work in Mr. Burr's favour, the plan\r\nof operations would be disclosed to me; but, although I had the power,\r\nand threatened to terminate the election, I had not even an intimation\r\nfrom any friend of Mr. Burr's that it would be desirable to them to\r\nprotract it. I never did discover that Mr. Burr used the least\r\ninfluence to promote the object we had in view. And being completely\r\npersuaded that Mr. Burr would not co-operate with us, I determined to\r\nend the contest by voting for Mr. Jefferson. I publicly announced the\r\nintention, which I designed to carry into effect the next day. In the\r\nmorning of the day there was a general meeting of the party, where it\r\nwas generally admitted Mr. Burr could not be elected; but some thought\r\nit was better to persist in our vote, and to go without a president\r\nrather than to elect Mr. Jefferson. The greater number, however,\r\nwished the election terminated, and a president made; and in the\r\ncourse of the day the manner was settled, which was afterward adopted,\r\nto end the business.\r\n\r\nMr. Burr probably might have put an end sooner to the election by\r\ncoming forward and declaring that he would not serve if chosen; but I\r\nhave no reason to believe, and never did think that he interfered,\r\neven to the point of personal influence, to obstruct the election of\r\nMr. Jefferson or to promote his own.\r\n\r\n\r\nInterrogatories to be administered to witnesses to be produced, sworn,\r\nand examined in a certain cause now depending and at issue in the\r\nSupreme Court of Judicature of the people of the state of New-York,\r\nwherein James Gillespie is plaintiff, and Abraham Smith defendant, on\r\nthe behalf of the defendant.\r\n\r\n1st. Do you or do you not know Thomas Jefferson, president of the\r\nUnited States? If yea, declare the same, together with the time when\r\nyou first became acquainted with him.\r\n\r\n2d. Was you a member of the House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates, at Washington, in the session of 1800 and 1801? If yea, state\r\nthe time particularly.\r\n\r\n3d. Do you or do you not know that in the years 1800 and 1801, Thomas\r\nJefferson and Aaron Burr had each an equal number of votes given by\r\nthe electors for president and vice-president of the United States,\r\nand that consequently the right of electing a president devolved upon\r\nthe House of Representatives of the United States? State your\r\nknowledge herein particularly.\r\n\r\n4th. Do you or do you not know, or have you heard so that you believe,\r\nof any negotiations, bargains, or agreements, in the year 1800 or\r\n1801, after the said equality became known and before the choice of\r\nthe president, by or on behalf of any person, and whom, with the\r\nparties called federal or republican, or either of them, or with any\r\nindividual or individuals, and whom, of either of the said parties,\r\nrelative to the office of president of the United States? If yea,\r\ndeclare the particulars thereof, and the reasons of such your belief.\r\n\r\n5th. Do you or do you not know Aaron Burr, late vice-president of the\r\nUnited States? If yea, declare the same, with the time when your\r\nacquaintance commenced.\r\n\r\n6th. Do you know, or have you heard so that you believe, of any\r\nnegotiations, bargains, or agreements in the year 1800 or 1801, by or\r\non behalf of the said Aaron Burr, or by or on behalf of any other\r\nperson, and whom, with the parties called federal or republican, or\r\neither of them, or with any individual, and whom, of the said parties,\r\nrelative to the office of president of the United States? If yea,\r\ndeclare the same, with all the particulars thereof, and the reasons of\r\nsuch your belief.\r\n\r\n7th. Did you receive any letters from the said Aaron Burr after the\r\nsaid equality of votes was known and before the final choice of a\r\npresident? If yea, what was the tenour of such letter? Did the conduct\r\nof the said Aaron Burr correspond with the declarations contained in\r\nthe said letter? Declare your knowledge and belief, together with the\r\ngrounds and reasons thereof.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeposition of the Honourable James A. Bayard, a witness produced,\r\nsworn, and examined in a cause depending in the Supreme Court of the\r\nstate of New-York, between James Gillespie, plaintiff, and Abraham\r\nSmith, defendant, on the part of the plaintiff, follows.\r\n\r\nTo the first interrogatory deponent answers and says, I do not know\r\neither the plaintiff or defendant.\r\n\r\nTo the second interrogatory he answers and says, I was personally\r\nacquainted with Thomas Jefferson before he became president of the\r\nUnited States, the precise length of time I do not recollect. The\r\nacquaintance did not extend beyond the common salutation upon meeting,\r\nand accidental conversation upon such meetings.\r\n\r\nTo the third interrogatory he answers and says, I was a member of the\r\nHouse of Representatives of the United States, during the fifth,\r\nsixth, and seventh Congresses, from the 3d of March, 1797, to the 3d\r\nof May, 1803.\r\n\r\nTo the fourth interrogatory he answers and says, The electoral votes\r\nfor Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr for president of the United States\r\nwere equal, and that the choice of one of them as president did\r\ndevolve on the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nTo the fifth interrogatory he answers and says, I presume this\r\ninterrogatory points to an occurrence which took place before the\r\nchoice of president was made, and after the balloting had continued\r\nfor several days, of which I have often publicly spoken. My memory\r\nenables me to state the transaction in substance correctly, but not to\r\nbe answerable for the precise words which were used upon the occasion.\r\nMessrs. Baer and Craik, members of the House of Representatives from\r\nMaryland, and General Morris, a member of the house from Vermont, and\r\nmyself, having the power to determine the votes of the states from\r\nsimilarity of views and opinions during the pendency of the election,\r\nmade an agreement to vote together. We foresaw that a crisis was\r\napproaching which might probably force us to separate in our votes\r\nfrom the party with whom we usually acted. We were determined to make\r\na president, and the period of Mr. Adams's administration was rapidly\r\napproaching.\r\n\r\nIn determining to recede from the opposition to Mr. Jefferson, it\r\noccurred to us that probably, instead of being obliged to surrender at\r\ndiscretion, we might obtain terms of capitulation. The gentlemen whose\r\nnames I have mentioned authorized me to declare their concurrence with\r\nme upon the best terms that could be procured. The vote of either of\r\nus was sufficient to decide the choice. With a view to the end\r\nmentioned, I applied to Mr. John Nicholas, a member of the house from\r\nVirginia, who was a particular friend of Mr. Jefferson. I stated to\r\nMr. Nicholas that if certain points of the future administration could\r\nbe understood and arranged with Mr. Jefferson, I was authorized to say\r\nthat three states would withdraw from an opposition to his election.\r\nHe asked me what those points were: I answered, First, sir, the\r\nsupport of the public credit; secondly, the maintenance of the naval\r\nsystem; and, lastly, that subordinate public officers employed only in\r\nthe execution of details established by law shall not be removed from\r\noffice on the ground of their political character, nor without\r\ncomplaint against their conduct. I explained myself that I considered\r\nit not only reasonable, but necessary, that offices of high discretion\r\nand confidence should be filled by men of Mr. Jefferson's choice. I\r\nexemplified by mentioning, on the one hand, the offices of the\r\nsecretaries of state, treasury, foreign ministers, &c., and, on the\r\nother, the collectors of ports, &c. Mr. Nicholas answered me that he\r\nconsidered the points as very reasonable; that he was satisfied that\r\nthey corresponded with the views and intentions of Mr. Jefferson, and\r\nknew him well. That he was acquainted with most of the gentlemen who\r\nwould probably be about him and enjoying his confidence in case he\r\nbecame president, and that, if I would be satisfied with his\r\nassurance, he could solemnly declare it as his opinion that Mr.\r\nJefferson, in his administration, would not depart from the points I\r\nhad proposed. I replied to Mr. Nicholas that I had not the least doubt\r\nof the sincerity of his declaration, and that his opinion was\r\nperfectly correct; but that I wanted an engagement, and that, if the\r\npoints could in any form be understood as conceded by Mr. Jefferson,\r\nthe election should be ended; and proposed to him to consult Mr.\r\nJefferson. This he declined, and said he could do no more than give me\r\nthe assurance of his own opinion as to the sentiments and designs of\r\nMr. Jefferson and his friends. I told him that was not\r\nsufficient--that we should not surrender without better terms. Upon\r\nthis we separated; and I shortly after met with General Smith, to whom\r\nI unfolded myself in the same manner that I had done to Mr. Nicholas.\r\nIn explaining myself to him in relation to the nature of the offices\r\nalluded to, I mentioned the offices of George Latimer, [2] collector\r\nof the port of Philadelphia, and Allen M'Lane, collector of\r\nWilmington. General Smith gave me the same assurances as to the\r\nobservance by Mr. Jefferson of the points which I had stated which Mr.\r\nNicholas had done. I told him I should not be satisfied or agree to\r\nyield till I had the assurance of Mr. Jefferson himself; but that, if\r\nhe would consult Mr. Jefferson, and bring the assurance from him, the\r\nelection should be ended. The general made no difficulty in consulting\r\nMr. Jefferson, and proposed giving me his answer the next morning. The\r\nnext day, upon our meeting, General Smith informed me that he had seen\r\nMr. Jefferson, and stated to him the points mentioned, and was\r\nauthorized by him to say that they corresponded with his views and\r\nintentions, and that we might confide in him accordingly. The\r\nopposition of Vermont, Maryland, and Delaware was immediately\r\nwithdrawn, and Mr. Jefferson was made president by the votes of ten\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nTo the sixth interrogatory the deponent answers and says, I was\r\nintroduced to Mr. Burr the day of Mr. Jefferson's inauguration as\r\npresident. I had no acquaintance with him before, and very little\r\nafterward, till the last winter of his vice-presidency, when I became\r\na member of the Senate of the United States.\r\n\r\nTo the seventh interrogatory the deponent answers and says, I do not\r\nknow, nor did I ever believe, from any information I received, that\r\nMr. Burr entered into any negotiation or agreement with any member of\r\neither party in relation to the presidential election which depended\r\nbefore the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nTo the eighth interrogotary the deponent answers and says, Upon the\r\nsubject of this interrogatory I can express only a loose opinion,\r\nfounded upon the conjectures at the time of what could be effected by\r\nMr. Burr by mortgaging the patronage of the executive. I can only say,\r\ngenerally, that I did believe at the time that he had the means of\r\nmaking himself president. But this opinion has no other ground than\r\nconjecture, derived from a knowledge of means which existed, and, if\r\napplied, their probable operation on individual characters. In answer\r\nto the last part of the interrogatory, deponent says, I know of\r\nnothing of which Mr. Burr was apprized which related to the election.\r\n\r\n(Signed) J. A. Bayard.\r\n\r\n_District of Columbia, Washington_.\r\n\r\nThe deposition of the Honourable James A. Bayard, consisting of six\r\npages, was taken and sworn to before us, this 3d day of April, A. D.\r\n1806.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN R. BRADLEY.\r\n\r\nGEORGE LOGAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeposition of the Honourable Samuel Smith, Senator of the United\r\nStates for the state of Maryland, a witness produced, sworn, and\r\nexamined in a cause depending in the Supreme Court of the state of\r\nNew-York, between James Gillespie, plaintiff, and Abraham Smith,\r\ndefendant, on the part and behalf of the defendant, as follows:\r\n\r\n1st. I knew Thomas Jefferson some years previous to 1800; the precise\r\ntime when our acquaintance commenced I do not recollect.\r\n\r\n2d and 3d. I was a member of the House of Representatives of the\r\nUnited States in 1800 and 1801, and know that Thomas Jefferson and\r\nAaron Burr had an equal number of the votes given by the electors of\r\npresident and vice-president of the United States.\r\n\r\n4th. Presuming that this question may have reference to conversations\r\n(for I know of no bargains or agreements) which took place at the time\r\nof the balloting, I will relate those which I well recollect to have\r\nhad with three gentlemen, separately, of the federal party. On the\r\nWednesday preceding the termination of the election, Colonel Josiah\r\nParker asked a conversation with me in private. He said that many\r\ngentlemen were desirous of putting an end to the election; that they\r\nonly wanted to know what would be the conduct of Mr. Jefferson in case\r\nhe should be elected president, particularly as it related to the\r\npublic debt, to commerce, and the navy. I had heard Mr. Jefferson\r\nconverse on all those subjects lately, and informed him what, I\r\nunderstood were the opinions of that gentleman. I lived in the house\r\nwith Mr. Jefferson, and, that I might be certain that what I bad said\r\nwas correct, I sought and had a conversation that evening with him on\r\nthose points, and, I presume, though I do not precisely recollect,\r\nthat I communicated to him the conversation which I had with Colonel\r\nParker.\r\n\r\nThe next day General Dayton (a senator), after some jesting\r\nconversation, asked me to converse with him in private. We retired. He\r\nsaid that he, with some other gentlemen, wished to have a termination\r\nput to the pending election; but be wished to know what were the\r\nopinions or conversations of Mr. Jefferson respecting the navy,\r\ncommerce, and the public debt. In answer, I said that I had last night\r\nhad conversation with Mr. Jefferson on all those subjects; that be had\r\ntold me that any opinion be should give at this time might be\r\nattributed to improper motives; that to me he had no hesitation in\r\nsaying that, as to the public debt, he had been averse to the manner\r\nof funding it, but that he did not believe there was any man who\r\nrespected his own character who would or could think of injuring its\r\ncredit at this time; that, on commerce, he thought that a correct idea\r\nof his opinions on that subject might be derived from his writings,\r\nand particularly from his conduct while he was minister at Paris, when\r\nbe thought he had evinced his attention to the commercial interest of\r\nhis country; that he had not changed opinion, and still did consider\r\nthe prosperity of our commerce as essential to the true interest of\r\nthe nation; that on the navy he had fully expressed his opinions in\r\nhis Notes on Virginia; that he adhered still to his ideas then given;\r\nthat he believed our growing commerce would call for protection; that\r\nhe had been averse to a too rapid increase of our navy; that he\r\nbelieved a navy must naturally grow out of our commerce, but thought\r\nprudence would advise its increase to progress with the increase of\r\nthe nation, and that in this way he was friendly to the establishment.\r\nGeneral Dayton appeared pleased with the conversation, and (I think)\r\nsaid, that if this conversation had taken place earlier, much trouble\r\nmight have been saved, or words to that effect.\r\n\r\nAt the funeral of Mr. Jones (of Georgia) I walked with Mr. Bayard (of\r\nDelaware). The approaching election became the subject of\r\nconversation. I recollect no part of that conversation except his\r\nsaying that he thought that a half hour's conversation between us\r\nmight settle the business. That idea was not again repeated. On the\r\nday after I had held the conversation with General Dayton, I was asked\r\nby Mr. Bayard to go into the committee-room. He then stated that he\r\nhad it in his power (and was so disposed) to terminate the election,\r\nbut he wished information as to Mr. Jefferson's opinions on certain\r\nsubjects, and mentioned, I think, the same three points already\r\nalluded to as asked by Colonel Parker and General Dayton, and received\r\nfrom me the same answer in substance (if not in words) that I have\r\ngiven to General Dayton. He added a fourth, to wit: What would be Mr.\r\nJefferson's conduct as to the public officers? He said he did not mean\r\nconfidential officers, but, by elucidating his question, he added,\r\nsuch as Mr. Latimer, of Philadelphia, and Mr. M'Lane, of Delaware. I\r\nanswered, that I never had heard Mr. Jefferson say any thing on that\r\nsubject. He requested that I would inquire, and inform him the next\r\nday. I did so. _And the next day (Saturday) told him that Mr.\r\nJefferson had said that he did not think that such officers ought to\r\nbe dismissed on political grounds only, except in cases where they had\r\nmade improper use of their offices to force the officers under them to\r\nvote contrary to their judgment. That, as to Mr. M'Lane, he had\r\nalready been spoken to in his behalf by Major Eccleston, and, from the\r\ncharacter given him by that gentleman, he considered him a meritorious\r\nofficer; of course, that he would not be displaced, or ought not to be\r\ndisplaced. I further added, that Mr. Bayard might rest assured (or\r\nwords to that effect) that Mr. Jefferson would conduct, as to those\r\npoints, agreeably to the opinions I had stated as his_. Mr. Bayard\r\nthen said, We will give the vote on Monday; and then separated. Early\r\nin the election my colleague, Mr. Baer, told me that we should have a\r\npresident; that they would not get up without electing one or the\r\nother of the gentlemen. Mr. Baer had voted against Mr. Jefferson until\r\nthe final vote, when I believe he withdrew, or voted blank, but do not\r\nperfectly recollect.\r\n\r\n5th. I became acquainted with Colonel Burr some time in the\r\nrevolutionary war.\r\n\r\n6th. I know of no agreement or bargain in the years 1800 and 1801 with\r\nany person or persons whatsoever respecting the office of president in\r\nbehalf of Aaron Burr, nor have I any reason to believe that any such\r\nexisted.\r\n\r\n7th. I received a letter from Colonel Burr, dated, I believe, 16th\r\nDecember, 1800, in reply to one which I had just before written him.\r\nThe letter of Colonel Burr is as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"It is highly improbable that I shall have an equal number of votes\r\nwith Mr. Jefferson; but, if such should be the result, every man who\r\nknows me ought to know that I would utterly disclaim all competition.\r\nBe assured that the federal party can entertain no wish for such an\r\nexchange. As to my friends, they would dishonour my views and insult\r\nmy feelings by a suspicion that I would submit to be instrumental in\r\ncounteracting the wishes and expectations of the people of the United\r\nStates. And I now constitute you my proxy to declare these sentiments\r\nif the occasion shall require.\"\r\n\r\nI have not now that letter by me, nor any other letter from him to\r\nrefer to; the preceding is taken from a printed copy, which\r\ncorresponds with my recollection, and which I believe to be correct.\r\nMy correspondence with him continued till the close of the election.\r\nIn none of his letters to me, or to any other person that I saw, was\r\nthere any thing that contradicted the sentiments contained in that\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n(Signed) S. SMITH.\r\n\r\n_City of Washington, in the District of Columbia_.\r\n\r\nThe deposition of the Honourable Samuel Smith, written upon five\r\npages, was duly taken and sworn to before us, two of the commissioners\r\nnamed in the annexed commission, at the capitol in the said city of\r\nWashington, on the fifteenth day of April, in the year of our Lord one\r\nthousand eight hundred and six, and of the independence of the United\r\nStates the thirtieth.\r\n\r\n(Signed) GEORGE LOGAN.\r\n\r\n         DAVID STONE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n1. Judge Cooper, of Cooperstown, state of New-York.\r\n\r\n2. During the year 1802 unsuccessful efforts were made by the\r\ndemocracy of Philadelphia to have Mr. Latimer removed from the office\r\nof collector. The federal party complained of the number of removals\r\nwhich had already been made. The Aurora of June 29, 1802, referring to\r\nthis subject, says--\"We can tell them (the federalists) that the most\r\nlucrative office under the government of the United States in this\r\ncommonwealth, the emoluments of which amount to triple the salary of\r\nthe governor of this commonwealth, is now held by _George Latimer,\r\ncollector of the customs;\" and on the 29th September, he adds, \"Let\r\nany man of candour say if Latimer ought not long since to have been\r\ndischarged from his office.\" Mr. Duane had not then read the\r\ndepositions of Messrs. Bayard and Smith, and perhaps was ignorant of\r\nthe _arrangements_ by virtue of which this gentleman and Mr. M'Lane,\r\nof Delaware, were retained in office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nA history of the presidential contest in Congress in the spring of\r\n1801, with an account of some of the circumstances which preceded and\r\nfollowed it, has now been presented. It afforded the enemies of\r\nColonel Burr an opportunity to lay a foundation deep and broad, from\r\nwhich to assail him with the battering-rams of detraction, falsehood,\r\nand calumny. From that day until the period when he was driven into\r\nexile from the land of his fathers, he was pursued with an intolerance\r\nrelentless as the grave. The assailants of his reputation and their\r\nmore wicked employers felt and knew the wrongs they had done.\r\nSelf-abased with reflecting on the motives which had impelled them to\r\naction, their zeal for his ruin became more fiery, and they faltered\r\nat no means, however dishonourable, to effect their object. The power\r\nof the press is great. But, painful as the remark is, it is\r\nnevertheless true--the power of the press to do evil is much greater\r\nthan to do good. The power of the press is too often irresistible when\r\nconducted by unprincipled and corrupt men, pampered by the smiles and\r\nthe patronage of those filling high places. A stronger illustration of\r\nthis remark cannot be found in history than the case of Aaron Burr\r\nfrom 1801 to 1804. At the height of his popularity, influence, and\r\nglory in the commencement of 1801, before the close of 1804 he was\r\nsuspected--contemned--derided, and prostrated; and this mighty\r\nrevolution in public opinion was effected without any wrong act or\r\ndeed on the part of the vice-president.\r\n\r\nThe charge against him was that he had been faithless to the political\r\nparty which had sustained him through life; that he had negotiated,\r\nbargained, or intrigued with the federalists to promote his own\r\nelection to the exclusion of Mr. Jefferson. The public mind became\r\npoisoned; suspicions were engendered; his revilers were cherished; the\r\nfew stout hearts that confided in his political integrity, and nobly\r\nclustered around him, were anathematized and proscribed. The\r\nmercenary, the selfish, and the timid united in the cry--down with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIt has been seen, that whenever and wherever the charge was rendered\r\ntangible by specification, it was met and repelled. For a refutation\r\nof the general charge, Mr. Bayard's and Mr. Smith's testimony is\r\nsufficiently explicit. Concurring testimony could be piled upon pile;\r\nbut, if there remains an individual in the community who will not be\r\nconvinced by the evidence which has been produced, then that\r\nindividual would not be convinced \"though one were to rise from the\r\ndead\" and bear testimony to the falsity of the charge.\r\n\r\nThe details in relation to the presidential contest of 1801 have\r\noccupied much time and space. This could not be avoided. It fixed the\r\ndestiny of Colonel Burr. Besides, it forms a great epoch in the\r\nhistory of our country and its government, and has been but\r\nimperfectly understood.\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson's malignity towards Colonel Burr never ceased but with\r\nhis last breath. His writings abound with proof of that malignity,\r\nsmothered, but rankling in his heart. Let the highminded man read the\r\nfollowing extracts Mr. Jefferson, in a long and laboured letter to\r\nColonel Burr, written uninvited, not in reply to one received, dated\r\nPhiladelphia, 17th June, 1797, says--\"The newspapers give so minutely\r\nwhat is passing in Congress, that nothing of detail can be wanting for\r\nyour information. Perhaps, however, some general view of our situation\r\nand prospects since you left us _may not be unacceptable. At any rate,\r\nit will give me an opportunity of recalling myself to your memory, and\r\nof_ EVIDENCING MY ESTEEM FOR YOU.\"\r\n\r\nIn his _Ana_, under date of the 26th of January, 1804, he says--, \"I\r\nhad never seen Colonel Burr till he came as a member of Senate. [1]\r\n\r\n_His conduct very soon inspired me with distrust. I habitually\r\ncautioned Mr. Madison against trusting him too much_.\"\r\n\r\nThus, according to his own showing, while he was endeavouring \"_to\r\nrecall himself to the memory_\" of Colonel Burr \"_and evidencing his\r\nesteem for him_,\" he was \"_habitually cautioning Mr. Madison against\r\ntrusting him too much_.\"\r\n\r\nAgain. January 26, 1804, be says--\"Colonel Burr, the vice-president,\r\ncalled on me in the evening, having previously asked an opportunity of\r\nconversing with me. He began by recapitulating summarily _that he had\r\ncome to New-York a stranger some years ago; that he found the country\r\nin possession of two rich families (the Livingstons and Clintons);\r\nthat his pursuits were not political, and he meddled not_,\" &c.\r\n\r\nNow who that knows the history of Colonel Burr's life will believe one\r\nsentence or one word of this statement? In the year 1778, Colonel Burr\r\nwas in command on the lines in Westchester. In July of that year he\r\nwas appointed by General Washington to receive from the commissioners\r\nfor conspiracies the suspected persons. He remained at this post\r\nduring the winter of 1778-79. Ill health compelled him, in March,\r\n1779, to resign. In the autumn of 1780 he commenced the study of law\r\nwith Judge Paterson, of New-Jersey, where he remained until the spring\r\nof 1781, when be removed to Orange county, in the state of New-York,\r\nand continued the study of law. In 1782 he was licensed by the Supreme\r\nCourt of the state of New-York as counsellor and attorney, and\r\nimmediately commenced practice in Albany. In July of that year he was\r\nmarried, then twenty-six years old. In April, 1783, through an agent,\r\nhe hired a house in the city of New-York, and removed his family into\r\nit as soon as the British evacuated the city. In the spring of 1784,\r\nsix months after his removal into the city, he was elected to\r\nrepresent it in the state legislature. [2]\r\n\r\nIn the face of these facts, to talk of his \"_having come to New York a\r\nstranger some years ago, and finding the state in possession of two\r\nrich families_,\" &c. What absurdity! But, shrinking from these\r\ndisgusting and revolting exposures, the reader, it is believed, will\r\ncheerfully turn to the perusal of those letters which again presents\r\nto his view Colonel Burr in the domestic and social scenes of life.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nTrenton, January 2, 1800.\r\n\r\nThe question--_When shall we meet_? is already answered; but I must\r\nnow answer it anew, and for a more distant day; perhaps Wednesday,\r\nperhaps Thursday; but you will hear again. Your letters amuse me; your\r\nrecovery rejoices me; your determination not to torment yourself is\r\nneither from philosophy nor spleen--it is mere words, and an attempt\r\nto deceive yourself, which may succeed for the moment; _ergo_, no\r\ndetermination; _ergo_, not founded on philosophy; _ergo_, not on\r\nresentment; _ergo_, neither. I have no doubt but _chose_ is on the\r\nway; the journey cannot at this season be performed in thirty days.\r\n\r\nMy compliments to A. C. M., and am very much obliged to them. It is\r\nthe most fatiguing thing imaginable for such crude tastes as those of\r\nTheodosia and A. B. You had better apologize. You are sick and I am\r\nabsent. But you have not mentioned the day--neither that of the\r\nbeauty's ball, for which I owe you much ill will, and therefore my\r\nnext shall be to _Natalie_, to whom all good wishes.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nAlbany, January 29, 1800.\r\n\r\nYou must be weary of hearing that \"I have not yet a line from you, and\r\nthat John and Alexis are not arrived,\" but you must submit to hear\r\noften of what so often employs my thoughts.\r\n\r\nMost of all, I amuse and torment myself by fancying your occupations,\r\nyour thoughts, your attitudes at different hours in the day and\r\nnight--generally I find you reading or studying; sometimes musing; now\r\nand then counting the time of my probable absence. In comes C. C.--a\r\npleasant interruption, or a note from C. C., and then follows trouble\r\nand embarrassments, and sometimes scolding. They are always answered,\r\nhowever.\r\n\r\nWe have agreed that the cause of Le Guen shall come on next Tuesday.\r\nIt will last the whole week. The week following I shall hope to leave\r\nthis place; but I may be deceived, for the court may take a week to\r\nconsider of the business, and I cannot leave the ground till the thing\r\nbe determined.\r\n\r\nAdieu, chere amiè,\r\n\r\nAARON BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nAlbany, February 13, 1800.\r\n\r\nYour letter by this day's mail, dated the 13th, and postmarked the\r\n12th, is one of those hasty and unsatisfactory scraps which neither\r\nimprove you nor amuse me. I pray you never to write to me with the\r\nmere motive of getting rid of the task. These performances always lead\r\nme to fear that all other tasks are performed in the same manner; but\r\nadieu to tasks and reproaches. I will endure your haste or your\r\nsilence without a murmur. One is not always in the bumour to write,\r\nand one always writes as much as the humour prompts.\r\n\r\nI am here sentinel over the interest of Le Guen, and cannot leave the\r\npost until the final decision be had, of which, at present, I form no\r\nconjecture as to the period; but I entertain no doubt of Le Guen's\r\neventual success.\r\n\r\nAmong the letters forwarded by you is one recommending to me in very\r\nhigh terms a Mr. Irving, or Irwin, [3] from London; pray inquire who\r\nhe is, and where to be found, and be able to inform me, on my return,\r\nif I _should_ happen to return.\r\n\r\nMr. Eacker has offered his services to take a letter. You see that I\r\ncannot refrain from improving every occasion of assuring, you how very\r\ntruly I am your faithful friend and affectionate father,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA,\r\n\r\nAlbany, February 15, 1800.\r\n\r\nThis will be handed you by Mr. Brown, [4] secretary to General\r\nHamilton. By the two preceding mails I had nothing from you; by that\r\nof this day I am again disappointed. I do indeed receive a very\r\npleasant little letter, but I expected a volume. Would it be an\r\nintolerable labour, if, precisely at half past nine o'clock every\r\nevening, you should say, \"I will now devote an hour to papa?\" Or even\r\nhalf an hour. Your last letter, though not illy written, has evident\r\nmarks of haste.\r\n\r\nI agree entirely with your eulogium on our amiable friend; but one\r\npoint you overlook. Her heart is as cold as marble, And you mistake\r\nthe effusions of politeness, mingled with respect, for symptoms of\r\ntender emotions.\r\n\r\nThe argument of the cause of Le Guen is concluded. I fear that I must\r\nwait for the final decision of the court before I can leave Albany.\r\nTo-morrow I go with John to Schenectady. I am more impatient to return\r\nthan I can express.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nAlbany, March 5, 1800.\r\n\r\nI had taken my passage for this day, and anticipated the pleasure of\r\ndining with you on Saturday. But--but--these buts--how they mar all\r\nthe fine theories of life! But our friend Thomas Morris [5] has\r\nentreated in such terms that I would devote this day and night to\r\ncertain subjects of the utmost moment to him, that I could not,\r\nwithout the appearance of unkindness, refuse. He would, I know, at any\r\ntime, devote a week or month, on like occasion, to serve me. How,\r\nthen, could I refuse him one day? I could not.\r\n\r\nBut, again, more buts. _But_ after I had consented to give him a day,\r\nI sent to take passage for to-morrow, and lo! the stage is taken by\r\nthe sheriff to transport criminals to the state prison. I should not\r\nbe much gratified with this kind of association on the road, and thus\r\nI apprehend that my journey will be (must be) postponed until Friday,\r\nand my engagement to dine with you until Monday.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH ALSTON.\r\n\r\nNew-York, January 15, 1801.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nYour two letters have been received, and gave me great pleasure. We\r\nare about to begin our journey to Albany. I propose to remain there\r\ntill the 10th of February; possibly till the 20th. If you should come\r\nnorthward, you will find a letter for you in the postoffice of this\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nThe equality of Jefferson and Burr excites great speculation and much\r\nanxiety. I believe that all will be well, and that Jefferson will be\r\nour president. Your friend,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA TO JOSEPH ALSTON.\r\n\r\nPoughkeepsie, January 24, 1801.\r\n\r\nThus far have we advanced on this _terrible_ journey, from which you\r\npredicted so many evils, Without meeting even with inconvenience. How\r\nstrange that Mr. Alston should be wrong. Do not, however, pray for\r\nmisfortunes to befall us that your character may be retrieved; it were\r\nuseless, I assure you; although I am very sensible how anxious you\r\nmust now be to inspire me with all due respect and reverence, I should\r\nprefer to feel it in any other way.\r\n\r\nWe shall go from hence to Albany in a sleigh, and hope to arrive on\r\nSunday evening, that we may be _settled_ on Thursday. Adieu. Health\r\nand happiness.\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. THEODOSIA B. ALSTON.\r\n\r\nAlbany, February 17, 1801.\r\n\r\nI have heard that you reached Fishkill on Sunday, and thence conclude\r\nthat you got home on Monday night. When in Philadelphia, send a note\r\nto Charles Biddle, inquiring, &c., and to inform him that you are\r\ngoing South. He will call and see you, being one of your great\r\nadmirers. Desire Doctor Edwards to give Mr. Alston a line to Cesar\r\nRodney, of Wilmington, a very respectable young man. He will introduce\r\nyou to the venerable Dickenson, who, knowing my great respect for him\r\n(which you will also take care to let him know), will be pleased to\r\nsee Mr. Alston and you on that footing. At Baltimore, either call\r\nimmediately on Mrs. Smith, or let her know of your arrival. You are to\r\nwait in Baltimore until I overtake you, which will be on the 28th at\r\nthe latest. Adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nWashington, March 8, 1801.\r\n\r\nYour little letter from Alexandria assured me of your safety, and for\r\na moment consoled me for your absence. The only solid consolation is\r\nthe belief that you will be happy, and the certainty that we shall\r\noften meet.\r\n\r\nI am to be detained here yet a week. Immediately on my return to\r\nNew-York I shall prepare for a tour to Georgetown or to Charleston;\r\nprobably a water passage.\r\n\r\nI.B. Prevost has been hurrying off Senat and Natalie; but for his\r\ninterposition they would have relied wholly on me, and I had already\r\nproposed that they should go with the chancellor some time in the\r\nsummer or autumn, which would have been then or never, as I had\r\npleased; but he (I.B.P.) has advised otherwise, and strongly urged\r\ntheir immediate departure. I think I shall be able to prevent it.\r\n\r\nWould Mr. Alston be willing to go as secretary to Chancellor\r\nLivingston? I beg his immediate answer.\r\n\r\nAdieu, ma chere amie.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nWashington, March 11, 1830.\r\n\r\nBy the time the enclosed shall reach Mr. Alston, it will have\r\ntravelled about three thousand miles. It will certainly deserve a kind\r\nreception. I leave mine open for your perusal; the other appears to be\r\nfrom _Miss Burr_.\r\n\r\nYour Dumfries letter was received yesterday. To pass a day in Dumfries\r\nis what you could not at any time very much desire; but to pass one\r\nthere against your will, and a rainy day too, was indeed enough to try\r\nyour tempers.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the 15th, I commence my journey to New York; there I shall\r\nnot arrive till the 25th. Nothing but _matrimony_ will prevent my\r\nvoyage to Charleston and Georgetown; and even so great an event shall\r\nonly postpone, but not defeat the project I am sorry, however, to add\r\nthat I have no expectations or decided views on this subject. I mean\r\nHymen.\r\n\r\nIt gives me very great pleasure to hear that Colonel W. Hampton is\r\nbecome, in some sort, your neighbour, by having purchased a plantation\r\nwithin fifteen or twenty miles (as is said) of Georgetown. Write me if\r\nthis be so.\r\n\r\nI have written to Frederick [6] as you commanded; that I might not err\r\nin expressing your ideas, I enclosed to him your letter. You have no\r\nwarmer friend on earth; no one who would so readily hazard his life to\r\nserve you. It always seemed to me that you did not know his value.\r\n\r\nCertain parts of your letter I cannot answer. Let us think of the\r\nexpected meeting, and not of the present separation. God bless thee\r\never.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nNew-York, Match 29, 1801.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, the 18th, I left the great city. At the Susquehannah the\r\nwind was rude; the river, swollen by recent rains, was rapid. The\r\nferrymen pronounced it to be impossible to pass with horses, and\r\nunsafe to attempt it. By the logic of money and brandy I persuaded\r\nthem to attempt it. We embarked; the wind was, indeed, too mighty for\r\nus, and we drove on the rocks; but the boat did not bilge or fill, as\r\nin all reason it ought to have done. I left Alexis and Harry to work\r\nout their way; got my precious carcass transported in a skiff, and\r\nwent on in a stage to pass a day with \"thee and thou.\" I was received\r\nby the father with parental affection--but of \"thee.\" How charming,\r\nhow enviable is this equanimity, if real. There is one invaluable\r\nattainment in the education of this sect; one which you and I never\r\nthought of: it is \"_tacere_.\" How particularly desirable this in a\r\nwife.\r\n\r\nAt Philadelphia I saw many--many, who inquired after you with great\r\ninterest--_sans doubte_. Among others I saw B., lovely and\r\ninteresting; but adieu to that. It cannot, must not, will not be; and\r\nthe next time I meet B., which will be in a few days, I will frankly\r\nsay so.\r\n\r\nI approached home as I would approach the sepulchre of all my friends.\r\nDreary, solitary, comfortless. It was no longer _home_. Natalie and ma\r\nbonne amie have been with me most of the time since my return (about\r\ntwenty-four hours past). My letters from Washington broke up that\r\ncursed plan of J. B. P.; they do not go in the parliamentaire; they do\r\nnot know when they go; and, in short, they rely wholly on me, so that\r\nthing is all right.\r\n\r\nThe elegant and accomplished Mrs. Edward Livingston died about ten\r\ndays ago. Mrs. Allen is in town; she is in better health than for\r\nyears past. As to my dear self, I am preparing with all imaginable\r\nzeal for a voyage to Charleston. One obstacle interposes; that you can\r\nconjecture. That removed, and I shall be off in forty-eight hours. I\r\nhope to be at sea by the 20th of April; but, alas! perhaps not. In\r\neight days you shall know more of this.\r\n\r\nYour letters have been received as far as Halifax. We conclude that\r\nyou got home on the 16th. It has been snowing here this whole day most\r\nvehemently. You are blessed with \"gentler skies.\" May all other\r\nblessings unite.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nNew-York, April 15, 1801.\r\n\r\nYour letters of the 24th and 25th March, received yesterday, give me\r\nthe first advice of your safe arrival at Clifton. The cordial and\r\naffectionate reception which you have met consoles me, as far as any\r\nthing can console me, for your absence.\r\n\r\nMy last will have advised you of the alteration in the plans of\r\nNatalie. Of all this she will write you; but I must say a word of my\r\nown plans. The ship South Carolina is now in port, and will sail on\r\nMonday next. I wish to take passage in her; but a thousand concerns of\r\nbusiness and obstacles of various kinds appear to oppose. I shall\r\ncombat them all with the zeal which my ardent wishes for the voyage\r\ninspire; yet I dare hardly hope to succeed. You shall hear again by\r\nthe mail of Saturday.\r\n\r\nYour female friends here complain of your silence; particularly Miss\r\nC., and, I am sure, _elle a raison_.\r\n\r\nThe reasons which you and your husband give against the voyage to\r\nFrance concur with my judgment. You can go a few years hence more\r\nrespectably, more agreeably. Adieu, chere enfalit.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH ALSTON.\r\n\r\nNew-York, April 27, 1801.\r\n\r\nOur election commences to-morrow, and will be open for three days. The\r\nrepublican members of assembly for this city will be carried by a\r\ngreater majority than last year, unless some fraud be practised at the\r\npolls. The corporation have bad the indecent hardiness to appoint\r\nknown and warm federalists (and no others) to be inspectors of the\r\nelection in every ward. Hamilton works day and night with the most\r\nintemperate and outrageous zeal, but I think wholly without effect.\r\n\r\nIf any reliance may be placed on our information from the country,\r\nClinton will be elected by a large majority. The best evidence of\r\ndispassionate opinion on this subject is, that bets are two to one in\r\nhis favour, and that the friends of Van Rensellaer wager with\r\nreluctance with such odds.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nNew-York, April 29, 1901.\r\n\r\nThis morning will sail the brig Echo, the only vessel in harbour\r\ndestined for South Carolina. I do not go in her. With unspeakable\r\nregret, therefore, the projected visit is abandoned--wholly and\r\nabsolutely abandoned. The pain of my own disappointment leaves me no\r\nroom for any sympathy with yours. There is one insurmountable\r\nobstacle, which I leave you to conjecture. If that were removed, it\r\nwould yet, for other reasons, be barely possible for me to go at this\r\ntime. But enough of disappointment; let us talk of indemnifications.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of June I must be at the city of Washington, After the 12th\r\nI shall be at leisure, and will meet you anywhere. Write me of your\r\nprojects, and address me at that place. How can Mr. Alston,\r\nconsistently with his views of business, leave the state for five or\r\nsix months, as you have proposed, for your Northern tour?\r\n\r\nOf the voyage to France I have written to you both about a fortnight\r\nago. I heartily applaud your judgment, and the motives which have\r\ninfluenced it. You may by-and-by go in a manner much more\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nHow very oddly your letters travel. That of the 30th March arrived on\r\nthe 15th, instant; and yesterday, those of the 6th and 13th by the\r\n_same_ mail. To solve this phenomenon, I am led to believe that they\r\nhave moved with a velocity proportioned to the spirit which was\r\ninfused in them by the writer. Thus, the first crawled with a torpor\r\ncorresponding with its character. It reminded me of the letter of a\r\nFrench lady, which I have shown you as a model of elegance. \"_Mon cher\r\nmari, je vous ecris parceque je n'ai rien a faire: je finis parceque\r\nje n'az rien a dire_.\" This was, indeed, the substance of yours; but,\r\nbeing spread over a whole page, the laconic beauty was lost, and the\r\ninanity only remained. The second, a grave, decent performance,\r\nmarched with becoming gravity, and performed the Journey in\r\ntwo-and-twenty days; but the third, replete with sprightliness and\r\nbeauty, burst from the thraldom of dulness, and made a transit\r\nunparalleled in the history of the country.\r\n\r\nYou will find in this theory some incentive to the exertion of genius;\r\nand I entertain no doubt but that, ere long, your letters will be sped\r\nwith the rapidity of a ray of light.\r\n\r\nWe have laughed at your horse negro, and have been very much amused by\r\nthe other charming little details. Thus letters should be written.\r\n\r\nBy this vessel I send two dozen pairs of long coloured kid gloves, and\r\nhalf a dozen pretty little short ones, _pour monter a cheval._ They\r\nare directed to your husband. I wish you would often give me orders,\r\nthat I may have the pleasure of doing something for you or your\r\namiable family.\r\n\r\nI had like to have forgotten to say a word in reply to your inquiries\r\nof matrimony, which would seem to indicate that I have no plan on the\r\nsubject. Such is the fact. You are or were my projector in this line.\r\nIf perchance I should have one, it will be executed before you will\r\nhear of the design. Yet I ought not to conceal that I have had a most\r\namiable overture from a lady \"who is always employed in something\r\nuseful.\" She was, you know, a few months past, engaged to another;\r\nthat other is suspended, if not quite dismissed. If I should meet her,\r\nand she should challenge me, I should probably strike at once. She is\r\nnot of that cast, yet a preference to rank only is not very flattering\r\nto vanity; a remark which may remind you of \"_Le moi._\"\r\n\r\nAdieu, chere enfante.\r\n\r\nAARON BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nNew-York, May 26, 1801.\r\n\r\nAnother parlementaire is preparing in this port, and _ma bonne amie_\r\nand Natalie are again preparing to sail; but you may rest assured that\r\nthey will not go. Their preparations are evidently mere form, and they\r\nare ready to yield to gentle persuasion. Yet you must not delay your\r\nvoyage hither, to aid, if necessary.\r\n\r\nBut, for a reason much more weighty, you must hasten--_il faut_. I\r\nwant your counsel and your exertions in an important negotiation,\r\nactually commenced, but not advancing, and which will probably be\r\nstationary until your arrival; more probably it may, however, in the\r\nmean time, retrograde. Quite a new subject.\r\n\r\nWho should present himself a few days ago but A. Burr Reeve. He has\r\ncome, with the consent of his father, to pass some weeks with me--more\r\nastonishment. I have put him in the hands of Natalie. She will find it\r\na hard job, but she has entered on the duty with great zeal and\r\nconfident hopes of complete success.\r\n\r\nBy the time this can reach you, you will be ready to embark for\r\nNew-York. You will find me in Broadway. Richmond Hill will remain\r\nvacant till your arrival. Adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nNew-York, August 20, 1801.\r\n\r\nMr. Astor, if he should not meet you to deliver this letter, will send\r\nit after you. Yet I dare not trust to such hazards the letters which I\r\nhave received for Mr. Alston and you, I persevere, therefore, in the\r\ndetermination to retain them.\r\n\r\nI was so very solicitous that you should see Niagara, that I was\r\nconstantly filled with apprehension lest something might prevent it.\r\nYour letter of the 29th of July relieves me. You had actually seen it.\r\nYour determination to visit Brandt gives me great pleasure,\r\nparticularly as I have lately received a very friendly letter from\r\nhim, in which he recapitulates your hospitality to him in _ancient\r\ndays_, and makes very kind inquiries respecting you; all this before\r\nhe could have entertained the remotest idea of seeing you in his own\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nNatalie and M. Senat have been for some weeks past at Trenton ; they\r\nare now on their return, and will be here to-morrow. Vanderlyn, of\r\nwhom I said something in my last, will immediately set about her\r\npicture. They (Natalie and Senat) are to go with the chancellor about\r\nthe last of September.\r\n\r\nWheeler will be here in a few days. Hampton is actually married to a\r\ncharming young girl--so General M'Pherson tells me. I forget her name.\r\nMr. Ewing is appointed consul to London, and has sailed. Mrs. Allen is\r\nstill at Elizabethtown. Adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS MORRIS.\r\n\r\nNew-York, September 18, 1801.\r\n\r\nMr. Vanderlyn, the young painter from Esopus, who went about six years\r\nago to Paris, has recently returned, having improved his time and\r\ntalents in a manner that does very great honour to himself, his\r\nfriends, and his country; proposing to return to France in the spring,\r\nhe wishes to take with him some American views, and for this purpose\r\nbe is now on his way through your Country to Niagara. I beg your\r\nadvice and protection. He is a perfect stranger to the roads, the\r\ncountry, and the customs of the people, and, in short, knows nothing\r\nbut what immediately concerns painting. From some samples which he has\r\nleft here, he is pronounced to be the first painter that now is or\r\never has been in America. Your affectionate friend,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM P. BUTLER\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, September 19, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI was yesterday afternoon favoured with your friendly letter of the\r\n16th. On the subject of removal from office, it appears to my finite\r\njudgment that it should be done sparingly, and only where it was\r\nabsolutely necessary. It is true, that the appointments during the\r\nlatter part of Mr. Washington's administration, and the whole of Mr.\r\nAdams's, were partial. It will, I think, be prudent not to follow\r\ntheir examples. Every man removed adds twenty enemies to republicanism\r\nand the present administration, while it gives us not one new friend;\r\nfor that man whose patriotism depended on his getting a place for\r\nhimself or connexion, is neither worth attending to nor keeping right.\r\nYou must be sensible that a general assault from one end of the line\r\nto the other will be made on the present administration. It is,\r\ntherefore, highly incumbent to be moderate, though firm, to prove to\r\nthe great body of the landed interest, the true support of good\r\ngovernment, that the present administration are the friends of an\r\nequal, mild, economic, and just government. We may expect the\r\npolitical vessel to be assailed by waves, but we must steer an even\r\nstraightforward course--united as friends in the same fate.\r\n\r\nYour observation respecting the political state of South Carolina is\r\nmore flattering to me than I merit. My offering for senator is out of\r\nthe question; but I am not, neither shall I be inactive on that\r\noccasion. I shall always feel happy in meeting you anywhere.\r\n\r\nYou will shortly see a statement of the Carolina election in print, by\r\na gentleman who was present. I was not present, though I believe I\r\nknow the facts. The thing will not be passed over without notice.\r\nCircumstantial facts are collecting. I regret that my two letters from\r\nCarolina at that time did not get to your hand. Your friend,\r\n\r\nP. BUTLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO, JOSEPH ALSTON.\r\n\r\nAlbany, October 15, 1801.\r\n\r\nOur Convention [7] met on Tuesday the 13th, and will probably continue\r\nin session five or six days longer. I shall forthwith return to\r\nNew-York, beyond which I have no plan for the month of November,\r\nexcept, negatively, that it will not be in my power to visit South\r\nCarolina till spring.\r\n\r\nOn the road I passed half an hour with Mrs. L., late Mary A. She\r\nappeared most sincerely glad to see me. She is still beautiful;\r\nsomething ennuyed with the monotony of a country life; talked of you\r\nwith the warmest affection. It is really a fraud on society to keep\r\nthat woman perpetually buried in woods and solitude.\r\n\r\nI am extremely solicitous to know how you get on. Pray make easy\r\njourneys, and be not too impatient to get forward. Never ride after\r\ndark, unless in case of unavoidable necessity, and then on horseback.\r\nWhat a volume of parental advice. God bless you both.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA\r\n\r\nNew-York, November 3, 1801.\r\n\r\nIt is very kind indeed to write me so often. Your last is from\r\nPetersburgh. \"Like gods,\" forsooth; why, you travel like--; that,\r\nhowever, was a very pretty allusion. I have repeated it a dozen times\r\nand more. Your other letters also contain now and then a spark of\r\nPromethean fire: a _spark_, mind ye; don't be vain.\r\n\r\nAnd so--has returned _sans femme_; just now arrived. He saw you and\r\nspoke to you, which rendered him doubly welcome to A. B.\r\n\r\nYou made two, perhaps more conquests on your Northern tour--King\r\nBrandt and the stage-driver; both of whom have been profuse in their\r\neulogies. Brandt has written me two letters on the subject. It would\r\nhave been quite in style if he had scalped your husband and made you\r\nQueen of the Mohawks.\r\n\r\nBartow, &c., are well. Mrs. Allen better. Mrs. Brockbolst Livingston\r\ndead. Mrs. Van Ness has this day a son. Thus, you see, the rotation is\r\npreserved, and the balance kept up.\r\n\r\nThere are no swaar apples this year; some others you shall have, and\r\n\"a set of cheap chimney ornaments.\" I have not asked the price, but\r\nnot exceeding _eight hundred dollars!_ Did you take away \"The man of\r\nNature?\" I proposed to have sent that with some others to L. N., but\r\nyou have thus marred the project.\r\n\r\nSince I began this letter I am summoned to leave town two hours before\r\ndaylight to-morrow morning, to return next day, when I shall know\r\ndefinitely the result of the sale, which, indeed, is the object of the\r\njourney. On my return I passed a day with M. A. Monsieur is cold,\r\nformal, monotonous, repulsive. Gods! what a mansion is that bosom for\r\nthe sensitive heart of poor M. Lovely victim! I wish she would break\r\nher pretty little neck. Yet, on second thought, would it not be better\r\nthat he break his? _He_ is often absent days and weeks. _She_ has not\r\nseen the smoke of a city in five years; but this is dull. I had\r\nsomething more cheerful to say; this, however, came first, and would\r\nhave place. And here am I, at midnight, talking such stuff to\r\nbagatelle, and twenty unanswered letters of _vast importance_ before\r\nme! Get to bed, you hussy.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNovember 5.\r\n\r\nThis letter was nicely sealed up and laid on my table; late last night\r\nI returned from the country, and found the letter just where I left\r\nit. Very surprising! This was so like my dear self, that I laughed and\r\nopened it, to add that Richmond Hill will probably be sold within ten\r\ndays for _one hundred and forty thousand dollars_, which, though not\r\nhalf the worth, is enough and more.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nNew-York, November 9, 1801.\r\n\r\nThis fine day brings me your two letters from Raleigh and\r\nFayetteville, 28th and 30th of October. It is quite consoling to find\r\nthat you will have taken the precaution to inquire the state of health\r\nbefore you venture your precious carcass into Charleston. A fever\r\nwould certainly mistake you for strangers, and snap at two such plump,\r\nruddy animals as you were when you left New-York.\r\n\r\nYou shall have apples, and nuts, and a cook, and _lucerne_ seed. As to\r\n_femme de chambre_, I cannot speak with certainty. I have put in\r\nmotion the whole French republic on the occasion. Mrs. Kemble's friend\r\ncannot be found. Most probably Madame S. has tortured into Gamble some\r\nname which has not a letter of Kemble or Gamble in it.\r\n\r\nNatalie sailed the Thursday after you left town, and she is probably\r\n_now_ in Havre with her mother. A letter received from Madame d'Lage\r\n[8] since Natalie sailed, advises us that she is there waiting for\r\nher, which is indeed most fortunate, and relieves me from a small\r\nportion of the anxiety which I suffer for that charming girl. Yet,\r\nalas! there is room for too much. I expect to see her here within a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nAnna wonders you do not write to her. It never occurred to her that\r\nshe had not written to you: so she is now occupied, and you may soon\r\nexpect at least twenty pages from her indefatigable pen. I am going to\r\nsee Board. There is an ancient story of a man who once gave life and\r\nspirit to marble (you may read it in the form of a drama in Rousseau).\r\nWhy may not this be done again? The sale of Richmond Hill goes on, and\r\nwill, I believe, be completed within eight days. The price and the\r\nterms are agreed; some little under works retard the conclusion.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear Theodosia.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH ALSTON\r\n\r\nNew-York, November 15, 1801.\r\n\r\nI send the enclosed newspaper merely on account of the proceedings of\r\nthe Rhode Island legislature. They are on the second page. That, in\r\nNew-England, men should be found hardy enough to oppose, in public\r\nspeeches, the recommendation of a thanksgiving sanctioned by the usage\r\nof one hundred and fifty years; that this opposition should prevail,\r\nand the recommendation be rejected by a large majority of a House of\r\nAssembly, are events the most extraordinary which the present\r\ngeneration hath beheld.\r\n\r\nIt has been announced in your gazettes that I am to visit Charleston\r\nthis month. Nothing is more true than that my warmest wishes have\r\nurged me to verify this expectation; but it is equally certain that I\r\nshall do no such thing. When I expressed the hope of seeing your state\r\npreviously to the session of Congress, I did not know that I was\r\nchosen a member of the Convention by the county of Orange, much less\r\ncould I foresee that I should be president of that Convention; and no\r\nindividual suspected that fifteen days would have been consumed in\r\naccomplishing the business of six hours. These circumstances ought to\r\nredeem my character, in this instance, at least, from the charge of\r\nversatility or caprice, Vale.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\nWashington, November 18, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nYour favour of the 10th has been received, as have been those also of\r\nSeptember 4th and 23d, in due time. These letters, all relating to\r\noffice, fall within the general rule which even the very first week of\r\nmy being engaged in the administration obliged me to establish, to\r\nwit, that of not answering letters on office specifically, but leaving\r\nthe answer to be found in what is done or not done on them. You will\r\nreadily conceive into what scrapes one would get by saying _no_,\r\neither with or without reasons; by using a softer language, which\r\nmight excite false hopes, or by saying _yes_ prematurely; and, to take\r\naway all offence from this silent answer, it is necessary to adhere to\r\nit in every case rigidly, as well with bosom friends as strangers.\r\n\r\nCaptain Sterret is arrived here from the Mediterranean. Congress will\r\nhave a question as to all the Barbary powers of some difficulty. We\r\nhave had under consideration Mr. Pusy's plans of fortification. They\r\nare scientifically done and expounded. He seems to prove that no works\r\nat either the Narrows or Governor's Island can stop a vessel; but to\r\nstop them at the Hook by a fort of _eight thousand_ men, and\r\nprotecting army of _twenty-nine thousand_, is beyond our present ideas\r\nof the scale of defence which we can adopt for all our seaport towns.\r\nHis estimate of _four millions of dollars_, which experience teaches\r\nus to double always, in a case where the law allows, but (I believe)\r\n_half a million_ ties our hands at once. We refer the case back to\r\nGovernor Clinton, to select half a dozen persons of judgment, of\r\nAmerican ideas, and to present such a plan, within our limits, as\r\nthese shall agree on. In the mean time, the general subject will be\r\nlaid before Congress. Accept assurances of my high respect and\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nNew-York, November 20, 1801.\r\n\r\nIt is several days since I wrote to you, and many more since I\r\nreceived a letter from you. That from Fayetteville is still the last.\r\n\r\n\"Gamble's\" protegée could not be found. You will probably gain by the\r\nexchange. That whom I shall send you is a good, steady-looking animal,\r\n_agée vingt trois_. From appearance, she has been used to count her\r\nbeads and work hard, and never thought of love or finery. The enclosed\r\nrecommendation of Madame Dupont, the elder, will tell you more. You\r\nare in equal luck with a cook. I have had him on trial a fortnight,\r\nand he is the best I ever had in the house; for cakes, pastry, and\r\njimcracks, far superior to Anthony. In short, he is too good for you,\r\nand I have a great mind not to send him; you will be for ever giving\r\ngood dinners. He has something of the manner and phisiognomy of Wood,\r\nyour teacher. _M'lle la femme de chambre and Monsieur le Cuisinier_\r\nare both pure French (not creole), and speak well the language. He\r\nwill take with him a quantity of casseroles and other implements of\r\nhis etat. They will be shipped off next week.\r\n\r\nThe sale of Richmond Hill is all off; blown up at the moment of\r\ncounting the money, partly by whim and partly by accident; something\r\nelse will be done to produce the effect. I go to Philadelphia in two\r\nor three days; but shall return, and not set off for Washington till\r\nnear Christmas. Mrs. A.'s health is much improved. God bless thee.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, November 26, 1801.\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 7th of November, from _Yaahanee_, is received at\r\nthis place. Though I am in the house with Mr. and Mrs. Lowndes, and\r\nseveral other Carolinians, yet we are wholly ignorant of your\r\nposition. No one ever heard of Yaahanee. I suspect it to be some\r\nMohawk word, which T. B. A. has been pleased to retain and apply--a\r\nvery pretty name, I acknowledge. Your reception has, indeed, been\r\ncharming; it reads more like an extract from some romance than matter\r\nof fact happening in the nineteenth century within the United States.\r\nI will ride fifty miles out of my way to see that lady.\r\n\r\nThe great business, as you are pleased to call it, has brought me\r\nhither. Not merely to see the statue, nor have I yet seen it; but am\r\nin the way. It will be a heavy job, considering that B. is on the\r\nspot. To return to the business. It will go on; it must go on; it\r\nshall go on. It will be Christmas before I see the city of Washington.\r\nMy lodgings are near the capitol, and next door to Law, who has\r\nremoved since we were together at his house. Your cook and maid must\r\nbe detained at New-York till my return, which will be in about eight\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nYour letter is pretty and lively, and indicates health, content, and\r\ncheerfulness, which is much better than if you had told me so, for\r\nthen I should not have believed a word of it.\r\n\r\nYou have learned from the newspapers (which you never read) the death\r\nof Philip Hamilton. [9]\r\n\r\nShot in a duel with Eacker, the lawyer. Some dispute at a theatre,\r\narising, as is said, out of politics. The story is variously related;\r\nwill give you a concise summary of the facts, in fifteen sheets of\r\npaper, with comments, and moral and sentimental reflections. To this I\r\ntake the liberty of referring you.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nNew-York, December 8, 1801.\r\n\r\nBy the ship Protectress you will receive all your things, together\r\nwith cook and maid. To sail on the 14th. On the day of sailing I will\r\nwrite to you, enclosing the bills of lading.\r\n\r\nYour interesting letter of the 23d is this day received. It brings me\r\nto the familiar acquaintance with your amiable circle, and admits me\r\nto your fireside more than any thing you have written. Mrs. Allen is\r\nhere. Anna will, to all appearance, be married before spring to a\r\nmerchant of the name of Pierpont. Catharine is astonished that she has\r\nnot yet an answer to her letter. I have told her that she can by no\r\npossibility have one before Christmas. In your reading, I wish you\r\nwould learn to read newspapers; not to become a partisan in politics,\r\nGod forbid, but they contain the occurrences of the day, and furnish\r\nthe standing topics of conversation. The reading of newspapers is a\r\nknack which you will acquire in six weeks, by reading, during that\r\ntime, every thing. With the aid of a gazetteer and atlas, you must\r\nfind every place that is spoken of. Pray, madam, do you know of what\r\nconsist the \"Republic of the Seven Islands?\" Do you know the present\r\nboundaries of the French republic? Neither, in all probability. Then\r\nhunt them.\r\n\r\nNow, one word of self. I came here on the 6th, and shall remain in\r\nNew-York till near the 20th. Then to Washington. The business is in a\r\nprosperous way. My great love for the fine arts, especially sculpture,\r\nmay detain me a week in Philadelphia. Adieu, ma belle.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n1. Mr. Burr had left the Senate previous to the date of this\r\nmemorandum.\r\n\r\n2. This is not all. It has already been demonstrated, and the fact is\r\nnotorious, that, from the year 1777 until after the adoption of the\r\nFederal Constitution, the Livingstons and Clintons were not acting in\r\nconcert. The Livingstons were of the Schuyler party. Before the\r\nrevolutionary war there were two great contending families in the\r\nstate of New York; but they were the Van Rensellaers and the\r\nDelancies.

The president's message, of which a copy was sent you by\r\nthis ship, will have reached you through other channels long before\r\nher arrival.\r\n\r\nOne idea contained in this message is much applauded by our ladies.\r\nThey unite in the opinion that the \"energies of the men ought to be\r\nprincipally employed in the multiplication of the human race,\" and in\r\nthis they promise an ardent and active co-operation. Thus, then, is\r\nestablished the point of universal coincidence in political opinion,\r\nand thus is verified the prophetic dictum, \"we are all republicans, we\r\nare all federalists.\" I hope the fair of your state will equally\r\ntestify their applause of this sentiment; and I enjoin it on you to\r\nmanifest your patriotism and your attachment to the administration by\r\n\"exerting your energies\" in the manner indicated.\r\n\r\n    \"To kill is brutal, to create Divine.\"\r\n\r\nI propose--now observe, this is not to be published--I propose early\r\nin the spring to take a ramble with you through your mountains. You\r\nhad best say nothing of your project of a location in the hills until\r\nit shall be executed; for, if competition should arise before you\r\nshall be suited, it would increase the expense of an establishment. I\r\nam impatient to hear that you are settled and at work. Very\r\naffectionately,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM DAVENPORT PHELPS.\r\n\r\nNew-York, December 15, 1801.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nThe enclosed copy of a letter from Captain Brandt to Isaac Chapin,\r\nEsq., superintendent of Indian affairs in the state of New-York,\r\ncomprising (I conceive) the plan by him committed to me, and to which\r\nhe alludes in his letter to yourself, for introducing moral\r\ninstruction among the Indians. This plan, agreeably to his request,\r\nwas recommended by the superintendent, and, so far as it respects the\r\nordination of a missionary, has been accomplished.\r\n\r\nIt yet remains, Sir, to provide means of support; and when the\r\nquestion respecting the instruction of their youth can be determined,\r\nby what means and in what manner this shall be effected.\r\n\r\nI will, at present, only use the freedom to suggest whether it might\r\nnot conduce to the furtherance and facilitating the above design to\r\nappropriate for their accommodation a suitable portion of land at or\r\nin the vicinity of Sandusky. Were the scattering tribes concentrated,\r\nand with them some of their countrymen and others as patterns of\r\nindustry and morality, such circumstances must be highly favourable to\r\nattempts to bring them into the habits of civilization.\r\n\r\nI am, with great respect,\r\n\r\nDAVENPORT PHELPS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM JOSEPH BRANDT.\r\n\r\nGrand River, May 7, 1800.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nAbout three weeks since I received a message from Obeel to attend a\r\ncouncil at Buffalo, where I expected the pleasure of seeing you. We\r\nattended and waited a few days; but the chiefs there not being ready\r\nto meet us, and we having business which required our attendance at\r\nthis place, were under the necessity of coming away. Had I been so\r\nfortunate as to have met you there, it was my intention to have\r\nconversed with you upon a subject which I have long considered as most\r\nimportant and interesting to the present and future well being of the\r\nIndians, on _both sides_ of the lakes and at large; namely, their\r\nsituation in a moral point of view, and concerning measures proper to\r\nbe taken in order that regular and stated religious instruction might\r\nbe introduced among them.\r\n\r\nYou well know, Sir, the general state of the Indians residing on the\r\nGrand River, as well as in other parts. A considerable number of some\r\nof these nations have long since embraced Christianity, and the\r\nconversion of others must depend, under the influence of the Great\r\nSpirit, on the faithful labours of a resident minister, who might\r\nvisit and instruct both here and elsewhere, as ways and doors might,\r\nfrom time to time, be opened for him.\r\n\r\nThe establishment and enlargement of civilization and Christianity\r\namong the natives must be most earnestly desired by all good men; and\r\nas religion and morality respect mankind at large, without any\r\nreference to the boundaries of civil governments, I flatter myself\r\nthat you, sir, will approve what many of the chiefs here, with myself,\r\nare so greatly desirous of.\r\n\r\nI have in view, as I have before suggested, the welfare of the Indians\r\nat large, being fully persuaded that nothing can so greatly contribute\r\nto their present and future happiness as their being brought into the\r\nhabits of virtue and morality, which, I trust, may and will be\r\ngradually effected by instruction, if properly attended and enforced\r\nby example.\r\n\r\nI well know the difficulty of finding a gentleman suitably qualified,\r\nand willing to devote his life to the work of a missionary among them;\r\nand especially one of talents and manners to render him agreeable in a\r\ndegree highly to favour his usefulness. And, in order to satisfy\r\nmyself in this respect, I have faithfully inquired and consulted, and\r\nam clearly of opinion that Mr. Davenport Phelps, who is recommended as\r\na gentleman of virtue and respectable accomplishments, is the most\r\nsuitable character for this office of any one within my knowledge. My\r\nlong acquaintance with his family, and particular knowledge of him, as\r\nwell as the Opinion and wishes of the most respectable characters\r\namong the white people in this vicinity, who earnestly wish, for\r\nthemselves as well as for us, that he may be ordained a missionary,\r\nmake me earnestly hope that you will officially recommend both the\r\ndesign and him to the right reverend bishops in the United States, or\r\nto some one of them, and to such other characters as you may think\r\nproper.\r\n\r\nFrom the consideration that religion and politics are distinct\r\nsubjects, we should not only be well satisfied to receive a missionary\r\nfrom a bishop in the United States, but, for various other reasons,\r\nwould prefer one from thence. We shall be able here to do something\r\nconsiderable towards Mr. Phelps's support; and I doubt not but others,\r\nwho have ability, will be disposed to assist in promoting so good a\r\nwork. I will add no more than that I have great satisfaction in being\r\nconfident of your friendly and influential exertions in this important\r\naffair, and that I am, with great sincerity, yours, &c.,\r\n\r\nJOSEPH BRANDT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nNew-York, December 15, 1801,\r\n\r\nYesterday Mr. Phelps, mentioned in the enclosed, delivered to me two\r\npairs of moccasins, directed--\"From Captain Joseph Brandt to Mr. and\r\nMrs. Alston.\" Your ship having sailed, I don't know how or when I\r\nshall forward them to you; but we will see. I send the original letter\r\nof Captain Brandt merely to show how an Indian can write. It is his\r\nown handwriting and composition. Upon this notice of his attention you\r\nshould write him a letter of acknowledgment for his hospitality, &c.,\r\nwhich you may enclose to me at Washington.\r\n\r\nDear little Anna is shortly to be married to a Mr. Pierpont, whom I do\r\nnot personally know; but he is said to be rich and handsome--a young\r\nman of industry and credit as a merchant. I think it will do pretty\r\nwell. E. has a lover--a man of consideration and property--measures\r\nsix feet eight inches and a half, shoes off; but so very modest that\r\nthey never will come to an explanation unless she shall begin. So no\r\nmore at present from your loving father,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM JUDGE WILLIAM P. VAN NESS.\r\n\r\nNew-York, January 2, 1802.\r\n\r\nSince your departure the affair with Wood [1] has assumed a very\r\nsingular aspect. When I told the printers that the negotiation was at\r\nan end unless they acceded to my proposition, it produced much\r\nagitation ; and yesterday they called to inform me that they had taken\r\nthe opinion of good counsel on the subject; that their determination\r\nwas not to publish, but to hold you liable for the expenses. Wood\r\ninforms them that he acted merely as your agent; that all his\r\nproposals were in strict conformity to your directions.\r\n\r\nDavis and Swartwout are of the opinion that we ought to get the work\r\npublished in its present form, if possible:\r\n\r\n1. Because our opponents say it unfolds the views of the federal\r\nparty; that it exposes their principal men, &c., and therefore we wish\r\nto withhold it:\r\n\r\n2. Because, if a new edition appears with the _same facts and\r\ncharacter_, they will say it has been subsequently introduced:\r\n\r\n3. Because, if _it_ is brought out now, the attempt to check it will\r\nhave a favourable tendency.\r\n\r\nHow far these ideas are correct, and what steps are best to take, you\r\nwill now be able to determine, and instruct me accordingly. The truth\r\nis, that instead of being unwilling and reluctant to suppress, they\r\ndare not publish the work without indemnity. I am anxious to know your\r\nopinion on the subject, and hope to hear from you on Tuesday next.\r\n\r\nW. P. Van Ness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nWashington, January 12, 1802.\r\n\r\nJust arrived at the city of Washington, this 12th day of January, A.\r\nD. 18O2. I have only time, before closing of the mail, \"to send you\r\nthese few lines, hoping they may find you in good health, as I am at\r\nthis present time,\" &c.\r\n\r\nA form of salutation to be found in a public letter of Julius Cesar,\r\nand in one of Cicero's familiar epistles.\r\n\r\nYour letters which greet me here are of the 2d and 20th of December\r\nonly; only two. Why, I expected to find a dozen, and some of them down\r\nto within three or four days of this date. Having a hundred letters\r\nbefore me unread, I must defer writing to you for the present. Adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nWashington, January 16, 1802.\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 20th December (the venison letter) is still the\r\nlast, though the Carolinians here have so late as the 3d and 4th of\r\nJanuary, of which I am a little jealous. It is quite unlucky that you\r\nhave been out of Charleston when your things arrived. How cook and\r\nmaid will dispose of themselves for the interim, I know not. Mighty\r\nmeek and humble we are grown. You really expect to do the honours of\r\nyour house _equal_ to, &c. I know better. It will be one of the most\r\ncheerful and amiable houses in the United States. I am gratified that\r\nyou do not start with splendour; to descend with dignity is rare.\r\n\r\nPray make no definitive arrangements against the mountains. My heart\r\nis set on running over them with Mr. Alston in the spring. Why may not\r\nPapa Alston be weaned as well as Papa Burr? My movements must depend\r\non the adjournment of Congress. Some say we shall adjourn the middle\r\nof April, and some the middle of June. As yet, I know nothing of the\r\nmatter; for, during the few days I have been here, I have been\r\nenveloped in ceremonies. I am pleasantly lodged near the capitol.\r\nEustis opposite to me. Law and Iruko my nearest neighbours.\r\n\r\nGood venison is not to be had at this season, and to send indifferent\r\nany thing (except a wife) from New-York would be treason. Yet, on this\r\nimportant subject, venison meaning, I have written to New-York. You\r\nneed not expect it, for I repeat that the best cannot now be had.\r\n\r\nYou must walk a great deal. It is the only exercise you can take with\r\nsafety and advantage, and, being in Charleston, I fear you will\r\nneglect it. I do entreat you to get a very stout pair of over shoes,\r\nor short boots, to draw on over your shoes. But shoes to come up to\r\nthe ankle bone, with one button to keep them on, will be best; thick\r\nenough, however, to turn water. The weather has not yet required this\r\nprecaution, but very soon it will, and I pray you to write me that you\r\nare so provided: without them you will not, cannot walk, and without\r\nexercise you will suffer in the month of May. To be at ease on this\r\nsubject, you must learn to walk without your husband--alone--or, if\r\nyou must be in form, with ten negroes at your heels. Your husband will\r\noften be occupied at the hours you would desire to walk, and you must\r\nnot _gener_ him: oh, never. Adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BARNABAS BIDWELL.\r\n\r\nWashington, February 1, 1802.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nThe newspapers will have shown the position of the bill now before the\r\nSenate for the repeal of the act of last session establishing a new\r\njudiciary system; and that the bill, when on its third reading, was,\r\nby the casting vote of the vice-president, referred to a select\r\ncommittee. This day notice has been given that a motion to discharge\r\nthat committee will be made to-morrow. It should be noted that the\r\narrival of Mr. Bradley has given a vote to the republican side; hence\r\nit may be presumed that the committee will be discharged, and that the\r\nbill will pass the Senate to-morrow, and that in the course of three\r\nweeks it will become a law. I state this, however, as mere conjecture.\r\n\r\nThe constitutional right and power of abolishing one judiciary system\r\nand establishing another cannot be doubted. The _power_ thus to\r\ndeprive judges of their offices and salaries must also be admitted;\r\nbut whether it would be _constitutionally moral_, if I may use the\r\nexpression, and, if so, whether it would be _politic_ and expedient,\r\nare questions on which I could wish to be further advised. Your\r\nopinion on these points would be particularly acceptable.\r\n\r\nWith entire respect and esteem,\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nWashington, January 22, 1802.\r\n\r\nStill silent. Yet is 20th December the latest date which I have\r\nreceived from you; hence I infer that you have remained at Georgetown\r\nmuch longer than was intended. Five weeks without hearing from you!\r\nIntolerable. Now I think to repose myself in sullen silence for five\r\nweeks from this date. I know that the apples and nuts will bring you\r\nout again. Thus children are moved; but I also thought that a pretty\r\nlittle letter, even without bonbons, would have done the same. I have\r\na very beautiful elegy on a lady whom you love better than any one in\r\nthe world; even better, I suspect, than L. N., and I was about to send\r\nit, but I won't till I hear from you: a nice, handsome letter; none of\r\nyour little white ink scrawls. They talk of adjourning. No; I won't\r\ntell you that either. I have nothing to say of myself, nor any thing\r\nto ask of you which has not been often asked. Tell me that Mari is\r\nhappy, and I shall know that you are so. Adieu, my dear little\r\nnegligent baggage. Yes; one question. Do you leave your cards T. B. A.\r\nor Joseph A.? What are L. N.'s? And one injunction repeated. Do not\r\nsuffer a tooth to be drawn, or any operation to be performed on your\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH ALSTON,\r\n\r\nWashington, February 2 1802.\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 10th of January was the first evidence of your\r\nexistence which I had received for near a month preceding. I hope your\r\nwife is allowed the use of pen, ink, and paper. Her letter, three days\r\nlater, has been also received. The successful \"execution of your\r\nenergies\" is highly grateful to me. It _seems probable_ that I shall\r\npronounce, in person, on the merit of the workmanship somewhere about\r\nMay day.\r\n\r\nThe repeal of the judicial system of 1801 engrosses the attention of\r\nboth houses of Congress. The bill is yet before the Senate. You may\r\nhave observed that some days ago it was referred to a special\r\ncommittee by the casting vote of the vice-president. Bradley having\r\narrived two days ago, and the republicans having thus an additional\r\nvote, the committee was this day discharged, and it is highly probable\r\nthat the bill will pass the Senate to-morrow. On this subject I\r\nhesitate, though it is not probable that my vote will be required. Of\r\nthe constitutionality of repealing the law I have no doubt, but the\r\nequity and expediency of depriving the twenty-six judges of office and\r\npay is not quite so obvious. Read the Constitution, and, having\r\ninformed yourself of the out-door talk, write me how you view the\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nIt has for months past been asserted that Spain has ceded Louisiana\r\nand the Floridas to France; and it may, I believe, be assumed as a\r\nfact. How do you account for the apathy of the public on this subject?\r\nTo me the arrangement appears to be pregnant with evil to the United\r\nStates. I wish you to think of it, and endeavour to excite attention\r\nto it through the newspapers. If you publish any thing, send me the\r\npapers which may contain it.\r\n\r\nTruxton is going out to the Mediterranean with three large and one\r\nsmall frigate. Apprehensions are entertained that our good ally,\r\nGeorge III, does secretly instigate and aid the Barbary powers. We do\r\nnot know that Tunis has declared war, but such an event will not\r\nsurprise me.\r\n\r\nI have not heard a syllable of any changes made or to be made in\r\noffices in your state, and, for reasons well known to you, I shall\r\nneither make an inquiry nor offer advice. C. Pinckney's nomination was\r\nconfirmed by one vote. All the other nominations have been confirmed,\r\nmostly without opposition.\r\n\r\nTheodosia writes me that the mountain plan is wholly abandoned for\r\nSullivan's Island. I do not, however, as yet abandon it; and, if I can\r\nget hence early in April, I think of going direct to Columbia, there\r\nto establish myself till you shall both condescend to visit me.\r\n\r\nWhen you shall be both settled in your own house, I crave a history of\r\n_one day,_ in the manner of Swift's journal to Stella; or, as you do\r\nnot like imitation, in your own manner. Vale.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA. Washington, February 2, 1802.\r\n\r\nI have just received a pretty little letter from C. C., all on nice,\r\npretty figured paper, such as you love, and she talks a great deal\r\nabout you; the substance of it is, that you are an ugly, little, lazy,\r\nstupid, good-for-nothing knurle, and that she is very sorry she ever\r\nwrote you a line. I can't vouch for the very words, but I think this\r\nis a fair abridgment of that part of her letter which concerns T. B.\r\nA. I wish you would teach half a dozen of your negroes to write; then\r\nyou might lay on the sofa, and, if you could submit to the labour of\r\nthinking and dictating, the thing would go on.\r\n\r\nWe make a pleasant society here, so that one may get through the\r\nwinter without ennui. I live at Mr. Law's, not nominally, but in fact.\r\nMrs. Madison is distant one mile. Anna Payne [2] is a great belle.\r\nMiss Nicholson [3] ditto, but more retired; frequently, however, at\r\nMrs. Law's. But pray, miss (madam), as to busts and statues, all the\r\nB.'s being out of the question, is there nothing in this line to be\r\nfound in South Carolina? I suppose it never came into your head to\r\nthink or inquire. Pray shake your little noddle, to give the brains,\r\nif any there be, a little action; but who can do two things at once?\r\nThat's true. I forgive thee all thy sins, without any further penance\r\nthan that which you have imposed on yourself. But write C. and poor\r\nlittle Anna, to congratulate her. Tell her what a fine fellow I learn\r\nher husband is. Mrs. Anna Constable Pierpont.\r\n\r\nWe have a perpetual summer here. I am weary of it, though, in truth, I\r\ncare nothing about it. With you it must be burning hot.\r\n\r\nThe cook had only Peggy to aid him; but as Peggy is equal to about\r\nforty South Carolina Africans, he is very reasonable if he asks only\r\nthirty-five, and ought to be indulged. Your maid will make a miserable\r\nhousekeeper, and be spoiled as femme de chambre, which last character\r\nis, I take it, the more important one. The poem or elegy is not sent,\r\nand is not forgotten. I am now going to smoke a segar and pray for\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nA. BURR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM CHARLES BIDDLE.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, February 3, 1802.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI enclose you a letter for Commodore Truxton. Should he be gone to\r\nNorfolk, please to forward it.\r\n\r\nEvery _gentleman_ here, and, what I am sure you think of much more\r\nconsequence, every _lady_, was much pleased with your vote on the\r\njudiciary bill. Those who do not think it unconstitutional to repeal\r\nthe law are of opinion it would be very injurious to do it. Your\r\nfriend,\r\n\r\nCHARLES BIDDLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM COLONEL MARINUS WILLETT.\r\n\r\nNew-York, February 4, 1802.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nWhat a racket this vile judiciary law makes. It must be repealed; but\r\nhow the judges, who have their appointment during good behaviour, are\r\nto be removed without making a breach in the constitution, is beyond\r\nmy abilities to develop. It will not, however, be the first assault on\r\nthat instrument; and, if two wrongs could make one right, this account\r\nmight be squared. But that horrid law must, indeed it must, be\r\nrepealed.\r\n\r\nI have received your two favours, one dated the 28th of January, and\r\nthe other without date. The effect of the abolition of the internal\r\ntaxes on Mr. Osgood [4] gives me no concern. He has plenty of other\r\nbusiness, and money enough without the income from his office.\r\n\r\nGod bless you; you have my prayers always; and who dare say they are\r\nnot as good as a bishop's, or any member of a Presbyterian synod?\r\nSometimes I think I'll turn Presbyterian, that I may have the benefit\r\nof their prayers not to outlive my useful days; an event I deprecate\r\nabove all others, and this is a prayer I never heard in our church--I\r\nmean my church, which, you know, is the Episcopal. Most sincerely your\r\nfriend,\r\n\r\nM. WILLETT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM JOHN M. TAYLOR. Philadelphia, February 5, 1802.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI had the pleasure of writing you some days ago, since which there are\r\npetitions circulating through the city for a repeal of the judiciary\r\nsystem. My own opinion is that there is no necessity for such a\r\nmeasure, as the two houses of Congress have the subject before them,\r\nand their decision will be had ere the petitions can be sent forward,\r\nand I have no doubt it will be repealed.\r\n\r\nI have reasoned with all those who thought you ought to have voted\r\nagainst it being referred to the committee of five, that your\r\nintention must have been to afford the opposite party time to discuss\r\nthe subject fully, so that they might not say of you and your friends\r\n(as Governeur Morris has said) that they pertinaciously forced it on\r\nthe then minority. I think it is better to give them time.\r\n\r\nYours, very respectfully,\r\n\r\nJOHN M. TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MRS. *******.\r\n\r\nNew-York, February 9, 1807.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of my writing you will exclaim--\" She is unhappy, or she\r\nwould not write to me.\" 'Tis not so, my dear friend; I am neither more\r\nnor less happy than when you left here. With every passing day I have\r\nresolved to inform you of my health, but from day to day it has been\r\ndeferred, till I suppose my very existence is forgotten. Let me, then,\r\nawaken your recollection, by presenting to you the image of my\r\nthoughts, and retrace, however faintly, the impression I once\r\nflattered myself to have made on your memory.\r\n\r\nTell me how you do, and how you pass your time. Taking lessons of\r\nWisdom from your Minerva? or flying after the Atalanta's of Virginia,\r\nmore swift than their celebrated racers? or, more probably, poring\r\nover musty records; offering your time, your pleasures, your health,\r\nat the shrine of Fame; sacrificing your own good for that of the\r\npublic; pursuing a chimera which ever has and ever will mock the\r\ngrasp; for, however the end may be crowned with success, the motives\r\nwill be questioned, and that justice which has been refused to a\r\nRegulus, a Brutus, a Publius, who can hope for?\r\n\r\nI once admired for device a _skyrocket_, and for motto--_Let me perish\r\nso I be exalted_.\" I afterward changed my opinion, and preferred the\r\n_glow-worm_ twinkling in a hedge. But I now reject them both. They\r\nstrike for a moment, but neither of them are impressive; and it is\r\nthus, in changing, we pursue that something \"which prompts, the\r\neternal sigh,\" which never is, which never can be attained. These\r\nreflections arise continually on my reading the newspapers, where your\r\nactions are so freely canvassed and so illiberally censured. They\r\noften excite my wrath; but when I consider that my anger can no more\r\ncheck their calumnies than the splendour of your reputation be clouded\r\nby their impotent attempts, my indignation subsides, and I console\r\nmyself by saying,\r\n\r\n  \"Vain his attempt who strives to please them all.\"\r\n\r\nZ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nWashington, February 21, 1802.\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 31st, accompanied by a note dated 1st February,\r\ncame by the mail of yesterday. A few lines from Mr. Alston, received\r\nsome days before, advised me of your journey to Clifton, and of the\r\ndistressing occasion. My heart sinks within me when I think of that\r\nlovely and disconsolate woman. Your conduct was worthy of you and of\r\nmy daughter. She must be restored to reason and to life, by being\r\nconvinced that she has some motive for enduring existence. If no other\r\ncan be shown, at least she can be persuaded that she is necessary to\r\nyou. But I learn from your letter, though you say nothing of it, that\r\nalthough she feels with anguish, yet she will not sink into\r\ndespondency. This testifies a mind of that dignity and firmness which\r\nyou had taught me to expect.\r\n\r\nNothing could have been more fortunate than the revival of the\r\nproject. It will divert the attention and summon up the spirits. You\r\nmust not condemn; it would be better to cherish it. Enter into all the\r\ndetails. Transport yourselves to Europe, and there take a nearer view\r\nand more accurate estimate of the dangers and advantages. Let those\r\nwho oppose it offer something in lieu. What! is she to wear out her\r\nyouth and beauty, dissipate her talents, and exhaust her spirits\r\nwithout an object in life or a place in society? Without enjoyment,\r\nwithout distinction? These hints will make you think I may hereafter\r\nsay more.\r\n\r\nMy life has no variety, and, of course, no incident. To my feelings\r\nyour letters are the most important occurrence. I am blessed with\r\nthree of them in three months. It did not use to be so. It would be no\r\nexcessive encroachment on your precious time to give me an hour twice\r\na week the evening preceding the post days. This I shall expect; _and\r\nthen_, and after one more communication, to be presently mentioned, I\r\nwill write definitely as to my spring projects.\r\n\r\nIt is of sculpture: a hint in your last indicates that you have\r\nsomething in view. Be pleased to give me name and description, in some\r\nmystical, sybillistical way, which, in case of robbery of mail, will\r\nnot disclose too much. One letter may contain the name, and another\r\nthe comment--_\"Car ou l'arreter?_\" is rather too mystical. I can make\r\nnothing of it, having studied it a full hour to no purpose.\r\n\r\nI entreat that you will always enclose your letter in a blank sheet,\r\non which is to be the seal and superscription. Health and blessings.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA Washington, February 23, 1802.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th day of March next I propose to write you of certain matters\r\nand things of high import, heretofore touched, but not elucidated to\r\nthe entire satisfaction of all the parties concerned, if, in the mean\r\ntime, you shall be of good behaviour.\r\n\r\nThis, however, was not what I sat down to say, nor can I by any\r\npossible means recollect what it was; but, in truth, I had something\r\nto communicate or something to ask. I don't know which. That we have a\r\ngreat snow storm and cold weather (now) will be no news to you, for\r\nthey will undoubtedly both be at Charleston long before this letter.\r\n\r\nI project, as you may have understood, a journey southward at some\r\ntime, yet nameless, during the current year (or century). Now, if my\r\nevil stars or good ones should, against my will and my judgment, take\r\nme through Norfolk, I am ruined and done; and there my journey will\r\nmost infallibly end. That I had better be hanged or drowned, you will\r\nreadily agree. The antidote or preventative is in your hands, or, if\r\nyou please, head. The bust, slightly referred to in the letter of the\r\n1st of February, has occupied some of my waking and sleeping moments.\r\nBe more particular, and especially the estimated value in dollars and\r\ncents; also, in what year or era manufactured, and the character and\r\nmerit of the work, as it strikes your fancy, but with some minuteness.\r\nYou know my rage for sculpture has cost me some money and led me into\r\nsome bad bargains. Thank God, I have got rid of them _all._ If you\r\nwill have _Pet_ or _Peet, Peter, Peter Yates, Peter Alston, Petrus\r\nBurr_ (or by every other name he may be known) taught to write a good\r\nhand, and make me a present of him, I will subscribe myself your very\r\nmuch obliged and humble servant,\r\n\r\nA.

It is not\r\ntwelve hours since I desired (directed) you to write, and lo! a letter\r\ndated the 9th of February. And even \"enclosed in a blank sheet of\r\npaper.\" A zealous manifestation of reciprocity is due to such\r\nrespectful attention, and thus, in obedience to the high commands of\r\nT. B. A., I do most sincerely and devoutly execrate all the postboys\r\nand the legislatures of the two most noble states the Carolinas.\r\n\r\nYou women: it is so with you all. If one wishes to exhibit the best\r\nside, one must provoke you. Gratify your wishes and expectations, or,\r\nstill worse, anticipate them, and it produces a lethargy. How have I\r\nlaboured for three months, working and writing to please a certain\r\nlady: nothing comes but inanity and torpor. I provoke her, and behold\r\nthe effusions of spirit and genius. Be assured that I shall not\r\nspeedily relapse into the same error. Indeed, I knew all this before;\r\nbut I thought it was only one's mistress that was to be thus\r\nmanaged--it is sex.\r\n\r\nFor certain reasons of state, neither the name nor the epitaph can yet\r\nbe given ; nor can it now be said precisely when. The verses are\r\nallowed to be very beautiful. Those on the anniversary of the wedding\r\nwere received (this day) in the presence of two poets and a poetess,\r\nwho said handsome things of them. The _ess_ being a maiden of\r\nthirty-five, drew a deep sigh.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it is impossible to say, for I never before heard of such a\r\nthing as that any public body should \"ajourn.\" They do commonly\r\nadjourn; and if, perchance, this should be what you mean, and you\r\nshall write me so, I will do my best to give you a categorical answer.\r\n\r\nNatalie arrived at Orleans on the twenty-sixth day; meaning that she\r\nhad twenty-six days' passage.

BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nWashington, February 26, 1802.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of your letter of the 14th justifies me in noticing you by\r\nthis mail. Your newspapers of the same date, and also of the 15th,\r\ncontain particulars of the races; but so technically expressed that I\r\ncomprehend nothing of it. Your story is quite intelligible as far\r\nforth as it is legible. I am very glad that Papa Alston has won once.\r\nIt is, I am told, the first time in his life. Where is Hampton all\r\nthis while, that you say nothing of him? Already I have told you that\r\non the 4th of March I shall say something of the adjournment, if, in\r\nthe mean time, you behave well. I shall not go first to New-York. Send\r\nback your chairs. General Smith's carriage has just ran away with four\r\nladies, viz.: Mrs. Smith, Miss Speare, Miss Smith, and Mrs. Law. Miss\r\nSmith was taken up dead, and brought home dead. After twenty-five\r\nminutes she began to show signs of life. In two hours she began to\r\nknow those about her, and now (three hours) she is perfectly well; and\r\nhaving been stripped and thoroughly examined, it cannot be discovered\r\nthat she has received the slightest injury, save being frightened to\r\ndeath, as before mentioned. Miss Speare came off unhurt. Mrs. Smith\r\nand Mrs. Law are much bruised. You will, I hope, understand that the\r\nhorses ran off with the carriage, and not that the carriage, of its\r\nown mere motion, ran off with the ladies. Adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nWashington, February 27, 1802.\r\n\r\nLast evening Eustis happened in my room while I was at Smith's\r\n(opposite); he saw the cover of your letter, and the few lines which\r\nit contains. He wrote what you will find enclosed, and left it on my\r\ntable. His cure is radical; that which I recommend is temporary.\r\n\r\nA dull, raw, misty, vile day. Mrs. Law confined to her bed, as I\r\nexpected, but not dangerous. The Smiths doing pretty well.\r\n\r\nThe judiciary bill debating in the House of Representatives, being the\r\nlast day of the second week devoted _exclusively_ to that subject. It\r\nmay and it may not be finished next week. When this shall be done\r\nwith, we may be able to make some sort of calculation as to the\r\nduration of the session.\r\n\r\nYour last letter is pleasant and cheerful. Careless, incorrect,\r\nslovenly, illegible. I dare not show a sentence of it even to Eustis.\r\nGod mend you.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nWashington, March 4, 1802.\r\n\r\nYou have supposed it to be from malice that I have not written you of\r\nthe adjournment and of my intentions. The truth is, that I know little\r\nmore of those matters than you do, and I have chosen rather to\r\npostpone it _en badinant_ than to write you crude conjectures; yet I\r\ncan do but little more at present.\r\n\r\nI left New-York with a determination not to return till I should have\r\nseen you and Charleston, and I arranged my business for an absence of\r\nsix months. I had hoped that the session of Congress would close by\r\nthe 15th of March or the 1st of April. On my arrival here every one\r\nsaid so, and I had like to have written it to you; but appearances did\r\nnot seem to justify the expectation of a short session. The business\r\nis hardly commenced, and I see no prospect of an adjournment until\r\nsome time in May. This is a great embarrassment; and your project of\r\nremaining on the coast is another. I could, with pleasure, have passed\r\nthe summer with you in the mountains; but the heat and dissipation of\r\nSullivan's Island is not so inviting. All this, however, is nothing to\r\nthe purpose of your inquiry. To come to the point. I still propose to\r\ngo South the instant I can disengage myself from this place; which may\r\nbe a very few days before the close of the session. I shall be at\r\nleast twenty days on the road. I entreat you, however, not to excite\r\nany expectation on the subject of my visit; not even to mention my\r\nintentions, until we shall see how far it may be in my power to\r\nexecute them. The judiciary bill being out of the way, I am in hopes\r\nwe shall engage zealously in the despatch of business. Of this matter\r\nI shall write further when I shall receive answers from you to my late\r\nletters. They may hasten or retard my movements a little, but not\r\nmuch. Adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nWashington, March 8, 1802.\r\n\r\nFrom an accurate attention to the dates of your letters, I discover\r\nthat you write on Sunday only; that if, by accident or mental\r\nindisposition, to which people in warm climates are liable, the\r\nbusiness should be put off for that day, it lays over to the next\r\nSunday, and so to a third or fourth, according to exigences, active or\r\npassive. Your letter, dated the 22d, but, in fact, written on Sunday\r\nthe 21st, was received by the mail preceding the last, which brought\r\nnothing. This letter is a confirmation of my theory of provocations,\r\nwhich I have lately enlarged and more accurately defined, deducing it\r\nfrom philosophical principles, and adapting it to different\r\n_climates_. When this volume shall be ready for publication, I propose\r\nto add, in an appendix, by way of illustration, a series of our\r\nletters.\r\n\r\nWhat you say of Huger shall receive due attention. Which _Maria_ did\r\nyour husband go for, the biped or the quadruped? It is impossible to\r\ndetermine from any thing in your letter. On the subject of busts you\r\nare more whimsical than even your father; just now you had something\r\nin view; but, on the 22d of February, \"worse than any part of the\r\nUnited States.\" I have no time to give you now an explanation of your\r\nice phenomenon, but will talk with T.I. and W.E. on the subject. Your\r\nlast was sealed _on the writing_, a vulgarism which I again condemn.\r\nAdieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nWashington, March 8, 1802.\r\n\r\nAt the moment of closing your letter, this scrap of a newspaper [1]\r\ncaught my eye, and is sent for your amusement. It is aimed at Aaron\r\nBurr, by whom, it is well known, the publication of the book [2] is\r\ndelayed or suppressed. The book consists of five hundred pages,\r\nprincipally low scurrility and illy-told private anecdotes; with about\r\nthirty pages of high eulogium on A. B. There may, for aught I know,\r\nhave been twenty other publications criminating the person by whom the\r\nwork has been suppressed. They are so utterly lost on me, that I never\r\nshould have seen even this, but that it came enclosed to me from a\r\nfriend in New-York, who is solicitous for _my honour_, &c.\r\n\r\nYou may judge of the purity and decency of the book when I mention\r\nthat some dozen of persons, by name, are charged with being bribed by\r\nBritish gold, and there is a surmise that General Pinckney is not\r\nreputed very _honest_. Of all the federal men, General Hamilton alone\r\nis treated with respect, even to flattery. My \"solicitous friend\" has\r\ngiven me a curious fact, of which I was ignorant till the receipt of\r\nhis letter. Barlas, a Scotchman, the publisher of the book, is private\r\ntutor to the children of General Hamilton. Adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH ALSTON.\r\n\r\nWashington, March 8, 1802.\r\n\r\nI learn, with a good deal of regret, that the mountain plan is\r\nabandoned; at least, that no measures are taken or meditated for its\r\nexecution. I should cheerfully acquiesce in any reasons founded on\r\nmotives of economy, convenience, regard to law business, or personal\r\ninfluence; but the solitary one assigned to me by Theodosia is, that\r\nyou and she _\"may be near papa and mamma\"_. Of this, too, I\r\nacknowledge the force; yet it might be considered that the mountain\r\nresidence was intended for certain months only, and that during the\r\nresidue (the greater part) of the year, papa and mamma might indulge\r\ntheir fondness. I had seen, or fancied that I saw in this project the\r\nassurance of health to yourself and wife, and sound constitutions to\r\nyour children; profit in the location; amusement and economy in the\r\nresidence, and an increase of your influence and connexions. How far\r\nit might comport with professional engagements, if seriously pursued,\r\nwas not considered. One personal motive, I confess, might have\r\ninfluenced my judgment; the pleasure I had promised to myself in\r\npassing the summer with you, and in projecting little schemes of\r\nimprovement and occupation. It is, indeed, with some hesitation that I\r\nshall visit your coast after the middle of May, and there is now no\r\nprospect of an adjournment of Congress before that time. Nevertheless,\r\nI shall come, though _at your hazard_, which, you know, would be a\r\ngreat consolation to me if I should be caught by a bilious fever in\r\nsome rice swamp. The situation of Theodosia, so far from being an\r\nobjection, ought, in my mind, to be an additional and strong motive.\r\nWith her Northern constitution she will bring you some puny brat that\r\nwill never last the summer out; but, in your mountains, one might\r\nexpect to see it climb a precipice at three weeks old. Truly, I mean\r\nto be serious, and beg to know whether you have, in fact, resolved,\r\nand whether the resolution has, in good faith, been the result of\r\nreflection or of inertness. You will pardon the surmise. I allow\r\nsomething for the climate, much for the influence of example; and\r\nthen, considering the uncommon warmth of the winter! it must be\r\nfatiguing even to talk of any thing requiring exertion.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity, however, with which your house has been furnished and\r\nestablished ought to redeem your wife from any share in this reproach.\r\nOn the 22d of February I find her fully occupied in those concerns,\r\nwith hopes of accomplishing the object by the time of my arrival. She\r\nwas then, however, taking an eight days' repose, that she might renew\r\nher labours with more vigour at the expiration of that time. But,\r\nagain, gravely I inquire where I am to find you about the middle or\r\nlast of May. I presume, in the place where this will find you.\r\nLocomotion is labour.\r\n\r\nI entreat your prompt attention to the enclosed memorandum, from my\r\ngood friend Mr. Law. He says that Chisholm has never informed him of\r\nthe disposition of the indents mentioned in his letter, of which the\r\nenclosed is a copy. Pray inquire and advise me. The thing is of small\r\nmoment; but I should be gratified in the occasion to show an interest\r\nin his concern, for I am daily overwhelmed by the multiplied\r\nkindnesses of himself and wife.\r\n\r\nThe gazettes will tell you better, I suspect, than I can what is doing\r\nin the House of Representatives. The sloth with which things move is a\r\ndaily source of vexation to me, as tending to protract the session. I\r\ndine with the president about once a fortnight, and now and then meet\r\nthe ministers in the street. They are all very busy: quite men of\r\nbusiness. The Senate and the vice-president are content with each\r\nother, and move on with courtesy.\r\n\r\nYour Rutledge will be in Charleston in the course of this month. I\r\nhope you are on terms of civility with him, for I receive from him the\r\nmost marked politeness. He will tell you of many strange things. God\r\nbless you ever.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM CHARLES BIDDLE.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, March 13, 1802.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nMr. Eckfeldt brought me five medals, four of which I sent by Mr. Ross;\r\nthe other shall be disposed of as you direct. The die of Truxton's\r\nmedal broke after fifty-two had been struck. I suppose Truxton will\r\nfeel more pain for this accident than he would to hear of the death of\r\nhis friend T. Coxe.\r\n\r\nYou mentioned that if Murray wrote in favour of Richard Jones, you had\r\nno doubt he would be appointed a midshipman. If the Secretary of the\r\nNavy sees the enclosed letter, perhaps he will give him a warrant. It\r\ncould be forwarded by Commodore Truxton, who I do not expect will sail\r\nbefore the 1st of April. Although I frequently trouble you about\r\ndifferent persons, believe me, my clear Sir, I do not wish you to do\r\nany thing whatever that will be disagreeable to you.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilkinson is much obliged to you for your friendship to the\r\ngeneral, which she says she will never forget. When James [3] sailed\r\nhe desired I would inform you that he would write you as soon as he\r\nhad any thing worth writing about. I believe you have no friend feels\r\na warmer attachment to you than James. Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nCHARLES BIDDLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM JOHN COATS.\r\n\r\nEaston (Maryland), March 13, 1802.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI have long had it in serious contemplation to address a letter to\r\nyou, but have frequently been restrained, from a knowledge that your\r\ntime has been and still is devoted to public service, and that every\r\nmoment is precious; and often I have been prevented by my own\r\navocations and engagements on this our bustling stage. I have vanity\r\nenough to think I possessed a share of your esteem and friendship,\r\nwhich could only originate from your belief that I had a claim to the\r\nvirtues, truth, candour, and sincerity. I detest the character of a\r\nhypocrite, and flatter myself no part of my past conduct can fix it\r\nupon me. Then permit me, with solemn truth, to declare, that when I\r\nsee your name in the prints, I feel involuntarily an animating glow,\r\nand it immediately brings to my recollection incidents sometimes\r\nproducing pleasing, and at others painful sensations, in which we have\r\nbeen mutually engaged and gone hand in hand. Although, to borrow the\r\nlanguage of our president, there may exist shades of political\r\ndifference between us, I have been your defender; and it was well\r\nunderstood and known that I spoke from an intimate acquaintance with\r\nyou as a soldier and a gentleman.\r\n\r\nFrequent reflection upon the various scenes we have encountered\r\ntogether has led me to lament the great distance that has so long\r\nprevented any social intercourse; but if the following description of\r\na new route, when you revisit New-York, meets your approbation, I may\r\nagain have the happiness of a friendly salute of the hand. I have\r\ntravelled from Philadelphia to Annapolis, _via_ Baltimore, and ever\r\nthought it a rugged road. I propose that you should come to Annapolis,\r\nwhere exceeding commodious passage-boats constantly ply, and you will\r\nin a few hours be landed at Haddaway's, upon our eastern shore, from\r\nwhence a line of stages run to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nUpon this route you will see a great number of your friends, added to\r\nwhich there will be novelty and ease. I cannot, indeed, promise you\r\nany romantic objects, such as _Caratoncka_ or Morenci Falls, or\r\ngigantic mountains, such as we clambered together in 1775; but you\r\nwill see a country approaching a high state of cultivation, and a\r\nnumber of towns, the most of which bear evident marks of daily\r\nimprovement. Between these towns are interspersed gentlemen's seats;\r\nsome of them beautifully situated, and the inhabitants generally\r\naffable, courteous, and hospitable. As to your ease, if you do not\r\ntravel in your own carriage, you will find the horses and carriages\r\nequal to any others; the public houses comfortable, the country\r\nabounding with the good things of this world, whether flesh, fish, or\r\nfowl, and the road good, having occasionally what may with propriety\r\nbe called gentle ascents and descents. My friends, Mr. Robert Wright,\r\nof the Senate, and Joseph H. Nicholson, of the House, who live\r\ndirectly on the road I have described, will confirm what I have\r\nwritten. Let me, then, once again enjoy your company, and that at my\r\nown hermitage. I shall be gratified by introducing the old lady, my\r\ntwo girls, and my boy to the companion and friend of my youth. They\r\nwill endeavour to make their _lillapee_ of a superior savour to what\r\nour cooks in days of yore could do for us. And although, as Partridge\r\nsays, \"non sum qualis eram,\" I shall certainly use my best exertions,\r\nwhile with us, to render your time agreeable.\r\n\r\nYour sincere and old friend,\r\n\r\nJOHN COATS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nWashington, March 14, 1802.\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 1st, postmarked the 3d, was received last evening.\r\nI regret that L. N. did not come to town, believing that you only\r\ncould console her; that she would make you an intelligent companion;\r\nand that you could restore the tone of her mind, without diminishing\r\nthe firmness of your own.\r\n\r\nPapa's present was the most gallant and charming thing that could have\r\nbeen imagined. By Mr. Rutledge, who goes to-morrow, I send this papa a\r\nlittle token which has been some weeks waiting for an opportunity. Mr.\r\nRutledge will tell you how I do, and what I do, and, _to an hour_,\r\nwhen Congress will adjourn. He sets off to-morrow, and will be in\r\nChilton about four days after this letter; of course, I do not write\r\nby him.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the box went with the ship which took your first\r\ncargo; but, as no one paid the least attention to the landing of the\r\narticles, nor to compare the delivery with the invoice, it may have\r\nbeen left on board. I will, however, write to New-York.\r\n\r\nThe story of P. is a fable. We are on the best terms, and he calls\r\nvery often to see me. The elegy may now be seen in the newspaper,\r\nwhich, considering how nearly it touched you, I thought the best mode\r\nof communication. Avoid sights. You say nothing of the progress of\r\nhousefurnishing and housekeeping.\r\n\r\nYour last was sealed, as too often before, on the writing. If your\r\n_Mari_ denies you a sheet of paper to enclose a letter, pray lay out\r\n_one_ of your four hundred dollars for this purpose. Adieu, ma chere\r\nenfante.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\nP. S. Somebody (I believe the Spectator) says that a postscript is\r\nalways the most important part of a lady's letter. This, then, will be\r\nfeminine.\r\n\r\nI have had three letters from Natalie. All full of interest and\r\namusement. Her remarks are equal to those of Lady Mary W. Montague for\r\ntheir truth and spirit, and far superior to any of our diplomatic\r\ncommunications. She is to travel from Nantz to Paris (about four\r\nhundred and fifty miles) _with her maid and postillion only_: an\r\nenterprise which no woman in France under forty hath executed without\r\nshipwreck during the last hundred years. Yet Natalie will do it\r\nwithout injury and without suspicion. I have taught her to rely on\r\n_herself_, and _I_ rely on her pride.\r\n\r\nI have said, and truly, that the story of P. is a fable. It may,\r\nhowever, by remote concatenation, and with the aid of great fancy and\r\na little malice, have grown out of a trifling and ridiculous incident\r\nwhich took place at New-York, and which I am sure you have heard. P.\r\nwas laughed at, and has behaved better ever since. There are at least\r\ntwenty (my neighbour, Mrs. Law, says fifty) such anecdotes now\r\ncirculating in this vicinity, _all equally unfounded_. Without any\r\nappeal, therefore, you may contradict all such as are inconsistent not\r\nonly with truth, but with probability. A lady of rank and consequence,\r\nwho bad a great curiosity to see the vice-president, after several\r\nplans and great trouble at length was gratified, and she declared that\r\nbe was the very ugliest man she had ever seen in her life. His bald\r\nhead, pale hatchet visage, and harsh countenance, certainly verify the\r\nlady's conclusion.\r\n\r\nYour very ugly and affectionate father,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM C. A. RODNEY.\r\n\r\nWilmington, March 15, 1802.\r\n\r\nHONOURED AND DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nThis will be delivered to you by Dr. A. Alexander, of Newcastle, in\r\nthis state. He has ever been a uniform and firm friend to the\r\nprinciples of our late glorious revolution. He has served many years\r\nin the capacity of a senator, and also of a representative in our\r\nlegislature, and can give you particular information as to the public\r\npulse here. He is a personal friend of mine; one whom I can recommend\r\nin the strongest terms.\r\n\r\nI had the pleasure of receiving yours of the 10th inst. on yesterday,\r\nand was very happy to hear from you. The advice you kindly give me I\r\nshall cheerfully take. It has ever been my maxim to be moderate but\r\nfirm. _Suaviter in modo, fortiter in re_, should be an axiom with all\r\npoliticians. We continue to progress in the high way of republicanism,\r\nand you will find, by our toasts, we have not forgot one of its ablest\r\nsupporters. [4] With great personal regard,\r\n\r\nYour sincere friend.\r\n\r\nC. A. RODNEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nWashington, March 19, 1802.\r\n\r\nFrom your letter of the 6th, received last evening, I infer that you\r\nare in some sort settled in your own house; that you pleased yourself\r\non that day is very grateful; that, too, I should have inferred from\r\nthe spirit of your letter. By the \"attack on Sullivan's Island\" was\r\nintended an attack on the plan of residence.\r\n\r\nI am just going on an errand to Baltimore, _de retour_ on Tuesday; so\r\nthat by the next mail you will have nothing from me. Where will you be\r\nfrom the 10th to 15th May? In Charleston, Sullivan's Island, or\r\nClifton? Is L. N. coming to live with you? I am quite charmed with\r\nJohn and Sally. Preparations for Baltimore occupy me so entirely that\r\nI cannot even think of you by this mail. Adieu.\r\n\r\nA. B.\r\n\r\nMarch 20.\r\n\r\nThe preceding was written the morning of yesterday. I folded, and\r\ndirected, and took it to Senate, thinking there to add a word. At ten\r\nlast night I found it lying in my pocket. The weather (rain) has\r\nprevented my Baltimore jaunt which was planned for this day. The hope\r\nof an early adjournment recedes. In short, all is uncertainty. It will\r\ndepend more on the thermometer than on the progress of business. When\r\nthe heat shall be intolerable here, shall I set my face towards the\r\nsun? I think I will. If you had been in the mountains! but that is not\r\nso.\r\n\r\nNatalie arrived in Paris the 31st December; her mother not there; but\r\nnumerous friends, who fatigue her with civilities. Her heart is in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThis will remain in the postoffice till the 23d. If, in the mean time,\r\nI receive a letter from you, a supplement will accompany this. Adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM C. A. RODNEY.\r\n\r\nWilmington, March 20, 1802.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI have perused with much pleasure the papers enclosed in your\r\nhighly-acceptable favours. The proposed state will possess the\r\nrepublican tone, and give additional weight to the scale which already\r\nso strongly preponderates. The repeal of all internal taxation will be\r\nsensibly felt by the people, and will _popularize_ our administration.\r\nThe expense of collecting those taxes, in consequence of the swarm of\r\npensioners attached to them, points them out as the proper object of\r\nretrenchment. The brown-sugar gentry in Congress; your tea-sippers and\r\nsalts-men (not Attic), who, by-the-by, have laid all those duties,\r\ncannot _agitate_ the public mind on those topics.\r\n\r\nI am happy to discover in the proceedings of the republicans so much\r\nmoderation, firmness, and unanimity. I trust their opponents will not\r\nhereafter think they want _nerve_. This conduct forms a striking\r\ncontrast with federal gasconade; and the effect of those things, in a\r\nfree country, is not easily calculated by common rule.\r\n\r\nThe polite and kind invitation you give me I should certainly accept\r\nof if in my power. I had thought seriously of it some weeks back; but\r\nyou must know I have purchased a little tract of land adjoining Dr.\r\nTilton's, which I once showed you, and have cut out abundant work for\r\nthe season. This, Dr. Tilton says, is to restore my health perfectly.\r\nThere are many friends at Washington it would give me great pleasure\r\nto see, but none more than yourself.\r\n\r\nMust sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nC. A. RODNEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM URIAH TRACEY. [5]\r\n\r\nWashington, March 29, 1802.\r\n\r\nThe sermon, for which I am indebted to your goodness, is now returned,\r\nwith many thanks for the loan.\r\n\r\nI have perused it with pleasure, and, I hope, profit. It is an\r\nexcellent treatise, worthy of the attention of every man, and more\r\nemphatically so of men in high and responsible stations in government.\r\n\r\nOur time is short, my friend, too short to allow an opportunity of\r\nretrieving almost any misspense of it; much more so to allow a\r\nredemption for any neglect to perform great public services when once\r\nhappily in our power. God grant that you may be profited by this, and,\r\nin turn, be more profitable to this distracted nation.\r\n\r\nU. TRACY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM GENERAL HORATIO GATES.\r\n\r\nNew-York, March 30, 1802.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nYesterday I was favoured with your obliging letter of the 23d inst. by\r\nMr. Peter Townsend; also, with a most beautiful silver medal from the\r\ndie I have presented you. It is in the highest polish and perfection.\r\nIn respect to the tin medal and its case, I have only heard of them\r\nfrom you, as I never received either, or a single line from Mr.\r\nDallas. But men so much engaged in business seldom have time to attend\r\nto such small affairs.\r\n\r\nWhen you see Dr. Murray, present my affectionate respects to him; he\r\nis, indeed, an old and highly esteemed friend. As to news, I never\r\nexpect any from statesmen high in office. So far as the session of the\r\nCongress has proceeded, _I_, poor little _I_, am satisfied with what\r\nthey have done. Taxes and law diminished should be approved of by the\r\nmany. The stricken deer will weep; but the powerful will, I trust, be\r\ngenerous to those who are not malignant. The charming Miss Church was,\r\non Thursday, married to Mr. Cruger. But I have a more serious piece of\r\nnews for your private ear. Young Secretary Sumter, on the passage to\r\nEurope, fell desperately in love with Miss Natalie d'Lage. They landed\r\nat Nantz, near her mother's chateau. The old lady is a furious\r\nroyalist, and will not hear of her daughter's being married to a\r\nrepublican; perhaps you know more than I can tell you what is likely\r\nto be the result.\r\n\r\nMr. Townsend goes so immediately to Orange county, that he prevents my\r\nintended civilities; but I trust be will hereafter put it in my power\r\nto cultivate his acquaintance. For any thing I see, your session will\r\nbe shortly over.\r\n\r\nJudge Brockholst Livingston took his seat in the City Hall yesterday.\r\nThis phenomenon (what shall I call it?) in office or in policy has\r\ncaused a grumbling in the legislature, where it seems to be laid aside\r\nfor future contention; but you will hear more from your\r\ncorrespondents. I am told it is nicknamed the Livingston act. My Mary\r\nis well, and has every desire to oblige you.\r\n\r\nAffectionately yours,\r\n\r\nHORATIO GATES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM DAVID GELSTON.\r\n\r\nNew-York, April 3, 1802.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI am favoured with yours of the 30th ult., with its enclosure. The\r\nsubject contained in my letter of the 22d to you has, in several\r\ninstances, become so important, that I wrote yesterday to Mr. Gallatin\r\non the same business.\r\n\r\nYou are, in general, so apt to decide promptly and correctly, that if\r\nyou had at once told me my construction of the law referred to was\r\nright, I should have wanted no more. We begin to look better in the\r\ncity--alarms are less frequent, confidence is gaining, and business\r\nincreasing.\r\n\r\nI have just received permission from the secretary of the treasury to\r\nmake some additional inspectors. Mr. L. shall be gratified, but my\r\nauthority is limited to the 15th of November next. If you have a\r\nparticular wish for any other person, please let me know immediately.\r\n\r\nYours, truly,\r\n\r\nD. GELSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nWashington, April 5, 1802.\r\n\r\nMA CHERE ENFANTE,\r\n\r\nDifferent accidents and interruptions prevented me from writing by the\r\ntwo last mails; a very unusual omission, and thus happens what, I\r\nbelieve, has never before occurred, that I have two of your letters\r\nunanswered, those of the 19th and 22d, both affecting and interesting.\r\nThe last of them acknowledges the receipt of a letter from me dated\r\nMarch 9th. Now, I did not write any letter under that date, it must be\r\na forgery. On the 8th and 12th I did write to you.\r\n\r\nIt is, I hope and believe, true that Richmond Hill is competent to all\r\npurposes; but nothing is done nor can be speedily done. The thing\r\nconstantly eludes a conclusion, and matters are, in fact, now as badly\r\ncircumstanced as one year ago. When I left New-York I arranged my\r\naffairs of _all kinds_ for six months' absence, which would extend to\r\nthe middle of June, with the determination to go hence to South\r\nCarolina, in which determination I persist; yet you know that _a\r\nsingle letter may take me in a contrary direction_, and mar all my\r\nplans of pleasure. This, and this only, produces the instability of my\r\nresolutions, and the equivocal tenour of my letters on the subject of\r\nthe visit.\r\n\r\nNothing certain can be predicated of the adjournment; but I am quite\r\nresolved not to remain here beyond the 25th, more probable that I may\r\nleave it on the 19th. In either case, it will be vain to address a\r\nletter to me at Washington after the receipt of this, as I shall not\r\nbe here to receive it. My route will be through Richmond and\r\nPetersburgh to Fayetteville, and thence to Georgetown and Clifton,\r\nwhere I presume I shall find Papa Alston, Ellen, &c. You may address\r\nme a line to Richmond, and another to Fayetteville, merely to say how\r\nyou are, and who more are dead. Recollecting, when you write, that it\r\nwill be very uncertain whether they will reach me; still, on my\r\narrival at those places, I shall be quite out of humour if I find no\r\nletter from you, and _will stay a week_ at each place in hopes of\r\nreceiving one.\r\n\r\nI have ordered Vanderlyn to send you, from New-York, both his and\r\nStuart's picture of A. Burr; and have told him to ship himself for the\r\nport of Charleston on the 1st of May.\r\n\r\nI have also desired that my beautiful little bust of Bonaparte be sent\r\nto Mr. William Alston.\r\n\r\nYou may send a letter to meet me at Clifton, and two or three to each\r\nplace if you find my movements so retarded as to admit a probability\r\nof their being received. Adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nWashington, April 12, 1802.\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 29th came by the last mail, exactly, as heretofore,\r\non the eighth day after the date of your last preceding. Whether it be\r\ninvariably Sunday or not, at least it is always octo-diurnal. Pray get\r\nan eight-day clock, and then all family matters will move on in strict\r\nuniformity. Thank your husband for his letter about Mr. Law's indents.\r\n\r\nThe instability of all human concerns has been a theme of remark for\r\nthe last 4000 years. Lately, very lately, I wrote you of my\r\ndetermination to leave this city on the 26th. I then thought so, as\r\nyou will readily believe; because, why should I deceive my dear little\r\nTheodosia? Now this thing is altered, for reasons too numerous and\r\nmighty to be here enumerated; and, besides, you know our doctrine is\r\nnot to give reasons, but to let the facts speak for themselves. On\r\nthis occasion, however, even your hard heart would yield to the\r\nmotives which govern me. The plan, I say, is all altered. Instead of\r\nleaving this fair region, as was gravely proposed, on the 26th of this\r\nmonth, the present project is to part from all I here hold dear on the\r\n20th (the _twentieth_) inst., which piece of caprice I hope you will\r\npardon. If no letter intervenes before that day, Papa Alston may\r\nexpect to see me in some twelve or fifteen days thereafter. I shall\r\nhope to find letters at Richmond, Fayetteville, &c. Adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nClifton, May 3, 1802.\r\n\r\nAt the moment of my arrival on Friday evening I wrote you from Mr.\r\nKinlock's. The day following (May 1) I came here, and, being without\r\nhorses, sent on Sunday morning to engage the whole stage, which was to\r\ngo to-morrow, and, as I understand, reaches Charleston in a day.\r\nUnfortunately, the stage was full--not even a seat vacant for the\r\nvice-president. I am, therefore, doomed to remain here one day longer,\r\nand to be two days on the road. My horses not having arrived, Mr.\r\nAlston will, on Wednesday morning, set out with me in his curricle. We\r\nshall dine and stay the night of Wednesday at Mrs. Mott's, and on the\r\nday following, Thursday evening, reach Charleston.\r\n\r\nI now send my man George (late Azor Le Guen, now George d'Grasse) to\r\nGeorgetown. If he can get a place in the stage, he goes on with my\r\nbaggage; if not, he sends this letter, with all affectionate good\r\nwishes. William arrived here this afternoon, and tells us that you are\r\nwell, and your husband _ill_. This is exactly wrong, unless he means\r\nto take the whole trouble off your hands, as some good husbands have\r\nheretofore done; so, at least, Darwin records. God bless thee, my dear\r\nTheodosia.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MIDSHIPMAN JAMES BIDDLE.\r\n\r\nU. S. Ship Constellation, at Gibraltar, May 8, 1802.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nAs the frigate Philadelphia will sail in a few days for America, I\r\ncannot neglect so good an opportunity of writing, and returning you my\r\nsincere thanks for the marked civilities I have received at all times\r\nfrom you, particularly at New-York in the summer of 1800. Be assured,\r\nSir, I feel the liveliest sense of the obligations I am under for the\r\nmany favours conferred upon me, and shall ever feel extremely happy to\r\nhave it in my power to render you any service.\r\n\r\nOwing to our being perplexed with almost constant easterly winds, we\r\ndid not make the land until the 24th ult., when we made Cape Canter,\r\non the coast of Africa. On the 28th we got into the Straits of\r\nGibraltar, but the wind heading us off the rock, we were obliged to\r\nbear away for Malaga. There we found the Essex and Philadelphia at\r\nanchor. On the 3d inst. we left Malaga, and arrived here in company\r\nwith the Philadelphia and Essex on the 5th, and I expect to remain\r\nuntil Commodore Truxton arrives on the station.\r\n\r\nWhile the ship lay at Malaga I had an opportunity of seeing every\r\nthing that could attract the eye of a stranger. The country round the\r\ncity is extremely fertile, abounding with all the different kinds of\r\nfruit-trees. Indeed, the lower class of the Spaniards subsist almost\r\nentirely upon fruit, the produce of the country. The chief articles of\r\nexportation are grapes, figs, raisins, oranges, anchovies, wines, &c.\r\nTheir streets are very narrow, running at random in every direction.\r\nTheir houses are mostly built of marble, four stories high, different\r\nfamilies occupying different stories of the same house. They have two\r\nor three forts, built on eminences adjacent to the city for its\r\nprotection, but they are out of order and decaying.\r\n\r\nI anticipate enjoying a very pleasant cruise, as we seem to be\r\nfavoured with every thing that could render our situation agreeable.\r\nCaptain Murray is one of the best of men, and treats us with all the\r\nkindness and attention we could wish. The climate is mild and healthy.\r\nThe Tripolitans keep among themselves, and never venture out, so that\r\nwe shall have nothing to do but to visit the different ports of the\r\nMediterranean. The closest friendship and harmony prevails among the\r\nofficers of the ship. Every thing, in short, that we could wish, we\r\nseem to have, to make our situation comfortable. Pray remember me\r\nkindly to Mrs. Alston, and believe me, with esteem and respect, your\r\nmost obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJAMES BIDDLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM JOHN TAYLOR, OF CAROLINE.\r\n\r\nVirginia, Caroline, May 25, 1802.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nYour favour, covering the medal struck to commemorate the most\r\nbrilliant exploit of the American war, from some cause unknown to me,\r\nnever arrived until this instant. It is particularly acceptable from\r\nthe circumstance of my having imbibed a personal affection for General\r\nGates by having served under him for a few months.\r\n\r\nIt would be quite premature in me to consider whether I would go into\r\nCongress unless it was probable that I could. The government have no\r\nmeans of providing for the gentleman you mention; and if they had, to\r\ndo so for the purpose of making room for another might expose them to\r\ncensures which they will hardly encounter. As to a voluntary\r\nresignation of his station, there are some circumstances in his case\r\nwhich do really justify him in refusing to do it, unless for some\r\nbetter prospect of public benefit.\r\n\r\nNot until some days after you left this was it discovered that you had\r\nforgotten your travelling map. I lamented the inconveniences to which\r\nthe oversight would expose you, but had no mode of removing them,\r\ndespairing, from a recollection of your horses, that either of mine\r\nwould be fleet enough to overtake you. The map could, therefore, only\r\nbe taken care of for the purpose of being restored to you. Permit me\r\nto hope that you will allow me to do this at my own house as you\r\nreturn; and that you will apprize me of your resolution to do so, both\r\nthat I may be at home and that I may enjoy the hope of your company\r\nbefore the pleasure is realized. Farewell.\r\n\r\nJOHN TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n1. A paragraph cut from the Aurora.\r\n\r\n2. Wood's History of John Adams's Administration.\r\n\r\n3.

I never met with more unremitted\r\npoliteness. He was constantly endeavouring to tempt my appetite by all\r\nthe delicacies in his own stores. To the child he proved an excellent\r\nnurse when I was fatigued and the rest sick. We are now in my father's\r\ntown-house. Mrs. Allen had gone up the North River before my arrival;\r\nthus I have seen neither her nor her sons. John is to return and be\r\nmarried in a few days.\r\n\r\nI have just returned from a ride in the country and a visit to\r\nRichmond Hill. Never did I behold this island so beautiful. The\r\nvariety of vivid greens; the finely-cultivated fields and gaudy\r\ngardens; the neat, cool air of the cit's boxes, peeping through\r\nstraight rows of tall poplars, and the elegance of some gentlemen's\r\nseats, commanding a view of the majestic Hudson, and the high, dark\r\nshores of New-Jersey, altogether form a scene so lively, so touching,\r\nand to me now so new, that I was in constant rapture. How much did I\r\nwish for you to join with me in admiring it. With how much regret did\r\nI recollect some rides we took together last summer. Ah, my husband,\r\nwhy are we separated? I had rather have been ill on Sullivan's Island\r\nwith you, than well separated from you. Even my amusements serve to\r\nincrease my unhappiness; for if any thing affords me pleasure, the\r\nthought that, were you here, you also would feel pleasure, and thus\r\nredouble mine, at once puts an end to enjoyment. You do not know how\r\nconstantly my whole mind is employed in thinking of you. Do you, my\r\nhusband, think as frequently of your Theo., and wish for her? Do you\r\nreally feel a vacuum in your pleasures? As for your wife, she has bid\r\nadieu to pleasure till next October. When, when will that month come?\r\nIt appears to me a century off. I can scarcely yet realize to myself\r\nthat we are to be so long separated. Do not imagine, however, that I\r\nmean to beg you to join me this summer. No, my husband, I know your\r\nreasons, and approve them. Your wife feels a consolation in talking of\r\nher sorrows to you; but she would think herself unworthy of you could\r\nshe not find fortitude enough to bear them! God knows how delighted I\r\nshall be when once again in your arms; but how much would my happiness\r\nbe diminished by recollecting that your advancement and interest\r\nsuffered. When we meet, let there be nothing to alloy a happiness so\r\npure, so unbounded. Our little boy grows charmingly; he is much\r\nadmired here. The colour of his eyes is not yet determined. You shall\r\nknow when it is.\r\n\r\nAs our papers were mixed, I left my writing-desk open; pray lock the\r\ndrawers and desk both, and keep the key yourself.\r\n\r\nHave you any rice on hand yet? It sells here for five dollars cash. If\r\nyou have any, had you not better send it? Papa intends writing to you\r\non the subject.\r\n\r\nI began a letter to you this morning in time for the mail, but was\r\nprevented by innumerable visits, which commenced before I was dressed\r\nfor breakfast. I am most impatiently waiting for a letter from you. I\r\nhope you wrote soon after my departure. I am counting every minute to\r\nnext Wednesday, when I hope to receive one, though I have many fears\r\nit is too early. With how much anxiety do I expect a letter. Maybe,\r\none of these days, I may tell you of a piece of weakness of mine on\r\nthat subject; maybe, for I do not know whether it is quite right for a\r\nwife to display all her foibles in that way to her husband. We have\r\nnot determined when or where we shall move in the country. It shall\r\ncertainly not be long ere we leave the city.\r\n\r\nAnna Pierpont is well. She and husband go on merrily. They love each\r\nother very much, and that is half the battle. She begged me not to\r\nomit giving a thousand loves to you. My love to the Hugers. Tell them\r\nI have seen Nancy. She looks better than they ever saw her. She has\r\ngot a colour, and is so much more beautiful that I scarcely recognised\r\nher. Adieu, mon bien aimi.\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA TO JOSEPH ALSTON.\r\n\r\nNew-York, June 26, 1802.\r\n\r\nWhen, when will the month of October come? It appears to recede\r\ninstead of approaching; and time, which extinguishes all other\r\nsorrows, serves but to increase mine; every moment I feel that I have\r\nlost so much of your society which can never be regained. Ah, my\r\nhusband, what can be pleasure to your Theo., unassisted by the charms\r\nof your presence and participation? Nothing. It is an idea which has\r\nno place in my mind unconnected with you.\r\n\r\nI send you M'Kenzie; there is no London edition in town more elegantly\r\nbound. Before my departure you complained grievously of the bad cigars\r\nsold in Charleston. In the hope that this city affords better, I send\r\nyou a box containing a thousand; the seller took some trouble to\r\nchoose the best for me, and I have added some Vanilla and Tonka beans\r\nto them. May the offering please my great Apollo! If you should do so\r\nrash a thing as to visit the city during the summer, pray smoke all\r\nthe time you remain there; it creates an atmosphere round you, and\r\nprevents impure air from reaching you.\r\n\r\nI wish, also, that you would never be in town before or after the\r\nmiddle of the day. I have somewhere heard that persons were less apt\r\nto catch infectious disorders at that time than any other, and I\r\nbelieve it. Have you never remarked how highly scented the air is\r\nbefore sunrise in a flower-garden, so much so as to render the smell\r\nof any flower totally imperceptible if you put it to your nose? That\r\nis, I suppose, because, when the sun acts with all his force, the air\r\nbecomes so rarefied, that the quantity of perfume you inhale at a\r\nbreath can have no effect; while, on the contrary, during the night,\r\nthe vapours become so condensed that you perceive them in every blast.\r\nMay not the same be the case with noxious vapours? It is said that the\r\nfever in Charleston does not arise from that, but the filth of the\r\nstreets are quite enough to make one think otherwise. Perhaps I am\r\nwrong both in my reason and opinion. If so, you are able to correct;\r\nonly do as you think best, and be prudent. It is all I ask. I imagine\r\nthe subject worth a reflection, and you cannot err. Montesquieu says\r\nhe writes to make people think; and why may not Theodosia?\r\n\r\nWe have this evening been to visit Mrs. Caines (late Mrs. Verplanck)\r\nat her country place. The marriage was thus published--Married, G.C.,\r\nEsq., counsellor of law, from the West Indies, _and now having a work\r\nin the press_, to Mrs., &c. That work has been the cause of some\r\ncuriosity and not a little amusement.\r\n\r\nI dined the other day with Mrs. Montgomery. The chancellor has sent\r\nher out a list of statues, which are to be so exactly imitated in\r\nplaster as to leave the difference of materials only. The statues are,\r\nthe Apollo Belvidere, Venus de Medicis, Laocoon and his children,\r\nAntinous, and some others. The patriotic citizens of New-York are now\r\nsubscribing to the importation of a set here for the good of the\r\npublic. If they are really perfect imitations, they will be a great\r\nacquisition to this city. But, _selon moi_, there is the difficulty.\r\nOur son looks charmingly. Adieu.\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA TO JOSEPH ALSTON.\r\n\r\nNew-York, June 28, 1802.\r\n\r\nAnd do you, indeed, miss your Theo.? Do you really find happiness\r\nindissolubly blended with her presence? Ah! my husband, how much more\r\namiable you are as the man than as the philosopher! How much better\r\nyour wife can love you! The latter character produces a distance\r\nbetween us; it so resembles coldness, that it annihilates all that\r\nfree communication of the heart, that certainty of the most perfect\r\nsympathy and concord of feeling, which affords so much real happiness.\r\nBelieve me, it is a very mistaken idea, that to discover sensibility\r\nat parting with a friend increases their sorrow. No; it consoles them.\r\nThat apparent indifference, instead of lessening their pain at\r\nseparation, only adds to it the mortification of finding themselves\r\nalone; wounds their feelings by the idea that, where they expected the\r\nmost sincere reciprocity, they meet with the most calm tranquillity;\r\nand, above all, it is apt to make them involuntarily exclaim--If I am\r\nthus regretted, how little shall I be thought of! How soon forgotten!\r\nNever, then, my beloved, attempt to play the philosopher. If you see a\r\nfriend weeping, weep with them. Sympathy is the sovereign cure for all\r\nwounds of the heart.\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 16th, which I received yesterday, delighted me the\r\nmore as it was unexpected. I did not _hope_ you would have written so\r\nsoon; still less did I imagine a letter from Charleston would reach\r\nthis on the eleventh day after date. How anxious I am for to-morrow.\r\nPerhaps I may hear from you again.\r\n\r\nS. appears more pleased with New-York than any person I ever saw from\r\nSouth Carolina. With the beauty of the country it is impossible not to\r\nbe delighted, whether that delight is confessed or not; and every\r\nwoman cannot fail to prefer the style of society, whatever she may\r\nsay. If she denies it, she is set down in my mind as insincere and\r\nweakly prejudiced.\r\n\r\nPray write your journal this summer; you have little else to do. I\r\nshould be charmed to find it finished on my return. Adieu.\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH ALSTON.\r\n\r\nNew-York, July 3, 1802.\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 19th of June, covering two for Theodosia, was\r\nreceived this morning. She, with Lady Nisbett and your boy, sailed\r\nyesterday for Red Hook (120 miles north) on a visit to Mrs. A., who\r\nhad solicited this attention in terms and under circumstances which\r\nadmitted of no refusal. The boy has grown surprisingly. The mother has\r\nrecovered her appetite and spirits. I shall go up to take care of them\r\nin ten or fifteen days.\r\n\r\nI desired your father to bring or send a barrel of rough rice (rice\r\nunpounded). The young Scotchman of whom I spoke to him has already\r\ninvented a machine which I think will clean ten times as much as your\r\npounding machine with the same power; that is, ten times as fast. Send\r\nthe rice that we may try.\r\n\r\nAs to the publications of Cheetham and Wood, it is not worth while to\r\nwrite any thing by way of comment or explanation. It will, in due\r\ntime, be known what they are, and what is Dewitt Clinton, their\r\ncolleague and instigator. These things will do no harm to me\r\npersonally. What effect they may have on the cause is a problem.\r\n\r\nI forgot to pay Placide for two or three times bathing. Give him a\r\nguinea for me. Yours, affectionately,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO NATALIE.\r\n\r\nNew-York, July 5, 1802.\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 22d of February, announcing your intended marriage,\r\nis this minute received. Nothing could be more grateful to me than\r\nyour proposed connexion with Mr. Sumter. I know little of him\r\npersonally, but his reputation and standing in society fully justify\r\nyour choice, and I pray you to assure him that I shall most cordially\r\ntake him to my bosom as a son. With his father I have been long\r\nacquainted, and always greatly respected him. We were fellow-soldiers\r\nduring our revolutionary war, in which he acted a most distinguished\r\npart, though we were not then known to each other. We served together\r\nsome years in Congress, and laboured in the same party. These\r\ncircumstances never fail to generate attachments, and I am truly happy\r\nin being more closely allied to him.\r\n\r\nI perceive, and with pleasure, that I shall pass much of my time in\r\nSouth Carolina, and shall divide it between you and Theodosia; but the\r\nmountains are my favourite residence. Which is my favourite daughter I\r\nhave not yet been able to decide. We must not, however, abandon\r\nNew-York. I will have you both here, if possible, every year, and at\r\nRichmond Hill you shall renew the recollection of the happy hours of\r\nyour childhood.\r\n\r\nI have been long impatient, my dear Natalie, to write you on this\r\nsubject, but I waited for advice from yourself. I was mortified to\r\nlearn from common report _only_ an event so nearly interesting, and\r\nwhich I had supposed you would have communicated to me the first. Your\r\nletter, however, has been long in America, and has travelled nearly\r\ntwo thousand miles in pursuit of me, having come in this morning from\r\nCharleston.\r\n\r\nI arrived here on the 23d with Theodosia, her boy--a most lovely boy,\r\nand her sister, Lady Nisbett, who salutes you as a sister, and longs\r\nto embrace you. We had a most charming passage of seven days.\r\n\r\nThis is a great holyday. We are celebrating, with show and much noise,\r\nthe 4th of July. This may appear to you a little ridiculous when you\r\nlook at the date of this letter; but, _madame_, please to look at your\r\nalmanac, and you will see that yesterday was Sunday. I should not have\r\nattempted to write to you amid so much bustle; but the good Mr.\r\nArcambal came in just as I received your letter, and informed me that\r\nthere was an immediate and safe opportunity to France, and I was\r\nimpatient to express to you and your husband my participation in your\r\njoys, and hearty approbation of your union. God bless you, my dear\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\nP.S. I have not received a line from your mamma in some years. I am\r\nnot at all surprised at her repugnance to your marriage with a\r\ndemocrat, the son of a rebel. She must hate, above all things,\r\ndemocrats and rebels. But tell her, as doubtless you have told her a\r\nthousand times, that she is wrong; and that we are not like your\r\nFrench democrats. Encore, adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA TO JOSEPH ALSTON.\r\n\r\nNew-York, September 3, 1802.\r\n\r\nWhat a pity minds could not be made sensible of each other's approach!\r\nWhy were we not so formed, that when your thoughts, your soul were\r\nwith your Theo., hers could be enabled, by the finest sensation of\r\nsympathy, to meet it. How superior to writing would that be! A letter\r\nis a month old before it is received; by that time other thoughts and\r\nsubjects engage the writer. The sentiments expressed in it seem no\r\nlonger warm from the heart. I have been all this evening divining your\r\noccupation. Sometimes I imagine you writing or reading, and then the\r\nhope that you are thinking of me arises. Pray what have you been\r\ndoing? If you can possibly recollect, let me know. After all, it is\r\nmore than probable that you have been smoking with Huger, entirely\r\nabsorbed in your society and segar.\r\n\r\nHow does your election advance? I am anxious to know something of it;\r\nnot from patriotism, however. It little concerns me which party\r\nsucceeds. Where you are, there is my country, and in you are centred\r\nall my wishes.\r\n\r\nWere you a Brutus, I should be a Roman. But were you a Caesar, I\r\nshould only wish glory to Rome that glory might be yours. As long as\r\nyou love me, I am nothing on earth but your wife and your friend:\r\ncontented and proud to be that.\r\n\r\nMr. M'Pherson is much better. He sits up--I mean out of bed, a great\r\npart of the day. Mr.----- spent about three hours with him yesterday.\r\nWhat a Chesterfieldian that is; he has not had the civility to call on\r\nme, although you were so attentive to him. He has grown sentimental.\r\nHe caught a moscheto the other day, and kept it under a tumbler to\r\nmeditate on, because it reminded him of Carolina, and consequently of\r\nMiss -----. What man under heaven ever before discovered an analogy\r\nbetween a moscheto and his mistress? I am very happy you have chosen\r\nchess for your amusement. It keeps you constantly in mind how poor\r\nkings fare without their queens. Our little one has been very amiable\r\nto-day. Adieu.\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH ALSTON.\r\n\r\nNew-York, July 19, 1802.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday (17th) Mr. and Mrs. Alston, Lady Nisbett, and Charlotte\r\ntook passage for Red Hook. The wind has been so favourable that they\r\nundoubtedly arrived yesterday before dinner. Charlotte had three or\r\nfour fits of ague and fever, but had escaped two days before she\r\nsailed, and was again in health.\r\n\r\nYou will herewith receive the second book. The malice and the motives\r\nare in this so obvious, that it will tend to discredit the whole. The\r\ncharges which are of any moment will be shown to be mere fabrications.\r\nBut there seems at present to be no medium of communication. The\r\nprinters, called republican in this city (Denniston and Cheetham), are\r\ndevoted to the Clintons, one of them (Denniston) being nephew of the\r\ngovernor, and, of course, cousin to Dewitt. Wood, after absconding for\r\nsome time, returned to this city, was put in jail, where he lay some\r\ndays and until taken out by _Coleman_. You will shortly receive an\r\nexplanation of this controversy, but not from me. Very affectionately\r\nyours,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH ALSTON.\r\n\r\nNew-York, August 2, 1802.\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 18th is received. Mr. Williams had before shown me\r\nthe pamphlet, and had informed me that it had produced all the effect\r\nthat the writer could have wished, which is the best evidence of the\r\nmerit of the work. It is evidently a hasty performance, and\r\nincorrectly printed, yet it displays ability as a writer, and\r\nsentiments honourable to him as a man.\r\n\r\nWood's book has surprised us. We all expected a new series of abuse\r\nagainst A.B. It should be entitled \"The Confessions of John Wood, one\r\nof the Conspirators lately associated with James Cheetham and Dewitt\r\nClinton against the vice-president.\" It shows pretty clearly the\r\nmotives and views of this clan.\r\n\r\nThe enclosed paper will give you the particulars of the affair of\r\nSwartwout and Clinton. You will perceive that the latter indirectly\r\nacknowledges that he is an agent in the calumnies against me.\r\n\r\nI am about to take possession of Richmond Hill for the reception of\r\nTheodosia and her boy, and shall go for them in about ten days. We\r\npropose to pass part of September in Orange county.\r\n\r\nThe letter herewith enclosed came to me under a _blank_ cover; through\r\ninattention, I broke the seal without looking at the superscription.\r\nThe first sentence betrayed my error, and I have scolded her a good\r\ndeal for her blank cover. Affectionately yours,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nNew-York, August 8, 1802.\r\n\r\nWith extreme reluctance, _madame_, I am constrained to resign to Dr.\r\nBrown the honour of escorting you hither. The circumstances which have\r\nled to this measure are briefly noted in a letter which I have this\r\nday written you by the mail.\r\n\r\nBy Tuesday the 9th inst. I shall be settled at Richmond Hill, ready to\r\nreceive you and your incumbrances. Tell Mr. and Mrs. Alston, &c., that\r\nI hope there to have the pleasure of accommodating them more to their\r\nsatisfaction than was in my power in the little mansion in Broadway.\r\n\r\nThe moment you shall receive this, send a line for me to the\r\npostoffice, saying how you are, when you will move, &c. Leave with the\r\npostmaster a written direction to forward to New-York all letters for\r\nMrs. Joseph Alston. I recommend to you to go round by Stockbridge to\r\nsee Binney. She is there at the house of Mr. Bidwell. You will also\r\nthere see your old great-uncle Edwards. But this is left to your\r\ndiscretion. If you go through Pittsfield, you should call and see H.\r\nVan Schaack, for whom Dr. Brown has a letter of credence. Make your\r\njourney perfectly at your ease; _id est_, with dignified leisure.\r\nWrite me at every post-town, for I shall have a deal of impatience and\r\nanxiety about you and your little nonentity.\r\n\r\nAll your friends here are well except George's dog and one of his\r\nSouth Carolina birds. We are all in the bustle of moving. Heighho! for\r\nRichmond Hill. What a pity you were not here, you do so love a bustle;\r\nand then you, and the brat, and the maid, and thirty trunks would add\r\nso charmingly to the confusion. Adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH ALSTON.\r\n\r\nNew-York, September 8, 1802.\r\n\r\nThe debility and loss of appetite which your wife has experienced\r\nalarmed me; yet I was totally ignorant of the cause. I was first\r\ninformed of it by Dr. Bard, who came accidentally to this city about a\r\nfortnight ago. He, with Hosack and Brown, all of whom I consulted,\r\njoined with me in opinion that she ought immediately to wean her child\r\nor provide a wet nurse. This she peremptorily refused, and the bare\r\nproposition occasioned so many tears and so much distress that I\r\nabandoned it. Within the last three days, however, she has such a loss\r\nof appetite and prostration of strength, that she is satisfied of the\r\nnecessity of the measure for the sake of the child, if not for\r\nherself; and I have this day sent off a man to the country to find a\r\nsuitable nurse. The complaint continued from the period of her\r\n_confinement_ during the whole time that she remained in Charleston.\r\n\r\nIt is most unfortunate that she left the Springs. While she was there,\r\neither by means of the air or the water, or perhaps both, she had got\r\nquite rid of the complaint, and there is no doubt but that, had she\r\nremained there a fortnight longer, the cure would have been radical.\r\nThe ride to Hudson, only thirty miles, brought on a relapse; and, with\r\nslight variations, the affliction was increased and her strength\r\ndiminished. Bard advised the Springs, and was quite angry that she\r\nleft them.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in this disorder which immediately threatens life;\r\nnor is it, at present, attended with pain; but if it should become\r\nfixed upon her, of which there is danger unless speedily cured, it\r\nwill unfit her for every duty and every enjoyment in life. The\r\nmedicines, which under the direction of Bard she used at Lebanon, have\r\nhitherto proved ineffectual since her return. I have written fully to\r\nEustis, and expect his answer within two or three days.\r\n\r\nThe present state of her health and strength will not, I think, admit\r\nof an attempt to take her to either of the Springs, or I should not\r\nhesitate to go off immediately with her. I have, however, strong and\r\nwell-grounded hopes that, when she shall have a nurse, and resume the\r\nuse of proper remedies, a cure will be effected.\r\n\r\nI have thought that you ought to be informed of these facts, as well\r\nto explain the varied accounts which you may have received of her\r\nhealth, as to anticipate the vague or exaggerated relations which you\r\nmay receive through other channels.\r\n\r\nMost affectionately yours,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA TO JOSEPH ALSTON.\r\n\r\nNew-York, September 30, 1802.\r\n\r\nAnother mail has arrived, but to your Theo. it has brought only\r\nunhappiness. It is now a week since I received your last letter. You\r\nare ill. You have been imprudent, and all my fears are fulfilled.\r\nWithout any one near you to feel for you, to attend to you, to watch\r\nevery change and share every pain. Your wife only could do that. It is\r\nher whose soul clings to yours, and vibrates but in harmony with it;\r\nwhose happiness, whose every emotion, more than entirely dependant on\r\nyours, are exchanged for them. It is she only who forgets herself in\r\nyou, and who, in gratifying your wishes or alleviating your pain,\r\nserves the interest nearest her heart. I know you have friends with\r\nyou; but, when you lose your vivacity, and your society is robbed of\r\nits usual charms, they will find your chamber dull, and leave it for\r\nsome more amusing place. They cannot, like your little Theo., hang\r\nover you in your sleep, and, with a beating heart, listen to every\r\ngroan and tremble at every noise. Your son, too, were we with you,\r\nwould charm away your cares. His smiles could not fail to sooth any\r\npain. They possess a magic which you cannot conceive till you see him.\r\nWould we were with you, my beloved. I am miserable about you. Adieu.\r\nHeaven bless my husband, and I am happy.\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA TO JOSEPH ALSTON.\r\n\r\nNew-York, October 30, 1802.\r\n\r\nI have just received yours of the 21st. You already know the result of\r\nmy confinement in bed. It certainly relieved me for some time, which\r\nproves how easily that cure would have succeeded at first. I have now\r\nabandoned all hope of recovery. I do not say it in a moment of\r\ndepression, but with all my reason about me. I am endeavouring to\r\nresign myself with cheerfulness; and you also, my husband, must summon\r\nup your fortitude to bear with a sick wife the rest of her life. At\r\npresent, my general health is very good; indeed, my appearance so\r\nperfectly announces it, that physicians smile at the idea of my being\r\nan invalid. The great misfortune of this complaint is, that one may\r\nvegetate forty years in a sort of middle state between life and death,\r\nwithout the enjoyment of one or the rest of the other.\r\n\r\nYou will now see your boy in a few days, and you will really be very\r\nmuch pleased with him. He is a sweet little rascal. If Heaven grant\r\nhim but to live, I shall never repent what he has cost me. Adieu.\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH ALSTON.\r\n\r\nNew-York, October 15, 1802.\r\n\r\nIn my letter of yesterday I said nothing of your son. He is well, and\r\ngrowing as you could wish. If I can see without prejudice, there never\r\nwas a finer boy.\r\n\r\nOf yourself I have a good deal to say; more than I can find time to\r\nwrite, and some things which cannot be written. Except the little\r\npractical knowledge which you may have gained by mingling with your\r\ncommittee-men, &c., your summer and autumn have, I perceive, been\r\nlost--lost, I mean, as to literary acquirements. From your companions,\r\nI presume, little is to be gained save the pastime of a social hour.\r\nYet time goes on, and you have much to do.\r\n\r\nTo the execution of any project, however, health is a sine qua non.\r\nWhether you can ever enjoy it in Charleston or on Sullivan's Island\r\nhas become a problem in my mind. I was quite shocked with your wan\r\nappearance when I first met you last spring. How different from that\r\nwhich you took hence the fall preceding. With every advantage\r\nattainable in your climate, you have scarcely been free from fever\r\nduring the season. This cannot fail to debilitate both mind and body.\r\nIf these hazards are to be annually encountered with similar effects,\r\nand worse may be apprehended, it is a price far beyond the value of\r\nany benefits which Charleston can offer. The _mountains_, a more\r\n_Northern latitude_, or the _grave_, must be your refuge. Pray think\r\nof these things. If I should not go to South Carolina this fall, nor\r\nyou come hither, let us meet in Washington next winter. After the\r\nrising of your legislature, you may find time for that journey. But I\r\nshould prefer to see you here immediately after your election, if\r\nthere be time for your return before the session of the legislature.\r\nYour health must require this change. _Here_ you may freeze out all\r\nyour \"miasmata\" and surplus bile in ten days, and go to Columbia with\r\nnerves well strung and blood well purified.\r\n\r\nMy solicitude for your frequent appearance in courts is _no way_\r\ndiminished. The applause which I heard bestowed upon you sunk into my\r\nheart. I could distinguish that which you merited from the fulsome\r\neulogy which was uttered through politeness. Your talent for writing\r\nis enviable, and, with cultivation, will be unrivalled (nothing\r\nwithout cultivation, remember). No one wishes so ardently as I do, not\r\neven you, that these advantages should be improved. But these\r\nconsiderations are unimportant compared with those which regard your\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nIf you should leave Charleston, give special orders about your\r\nletters, for I may write what I should wish no one but you to see.\r\nAffectionately adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH ALSTON.\r\n\r\nNew-York, November 5, 1802.\r\n\r\nThe cold weather of the last ten days has had a happy effect on\r\nTheodosia. She is so far restored that I can with confidence assure\r\nyou she will return in health. The boy, too, grows fat and rosy with\r\nthe frost. They have taken passage in the brig Enterprise, Captain\r\nTombs, the same with whom we came last June. She will have the control\r\nof the cabin, and will be perfectly well accommodated. I regret she\r\nwill sail so soon (the 12th), as well because I cannot attend her as\r\nthat I could have wished her health and that of the boy to have been\r\nstill more confirmed. Yet I cannot any longer resist her impatience.\r\nYou must not delay your journey to Columbia in expectation of her\r\narrival. It is important that you be on the ground the first day, and\r\nit is to be desired that you could be there two or three days before\r\nthe commencement of the session. If you should be gone, she projects\r\nto follow you, of which I advise you, that you may leave your\r\ndirections. When you shall see her and son, you will not regret this\r\nfive months' separation. I rejoice that you are to meet Major Pinckney\r\non the floor of your assembly. \"_The Citizen_\" (Cheetham and\r\nDenniston's), in publishing a list of members chosen in Charleston and\r\nits vicinity, omitted your name; but took care to add, by way of\r\nextract from a pretended letter, that the Alstons were of no\r\nconsideration or influence in South Carolina. There is no bound to the\r\nmalice of these people. The conspiracy was formed last winter at\r\nWashington. A little reflection will indicate to you the description\r\nof men, the motives, and the object of this combination.\r\n\r\nApologize for me to Ch. Marshall that I do not fulfil my engagement to\r\naccompany him from Charleston to Washington. I hope you will bring him\r\nwith you.\r\n\r\nWould Charles Lee accept the place of secretary of the Senate? It is\r\nworth twenty-three hundred dollars per annum, and not laborious. The\r\nsecretary, you know, is chosen by the Senate. Otis, the present\r\nincumbent, will probably decline. If you should think that Lee would\r\ndesire it, and the thing should appear to you proper, it should be\r\nsuggested to your senators. Of the legislative subjects mentioned in\r\none of your letters, I hope to find time to say a word on Sunday (7th\r\ninst.). God bless you.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nNew-York, December 4, 1802.\r\n\r\nSo you arrived on the 24th, after a passage of ten days; you and the\r\nCharleston packet on the same day. All this I learned last night; not\r\nfrom you. Vanderlyn and I drank a bottle of Champagne on the occasion.\r\n\r\nThough this relieves me from the great anxiety under which I laboured,\r\nstill there are many details of your passage, your arrival, &c., on\r\nwhich nothing but your letter can satisfy me. For some unknown reason,\r\nthe mail is now eighteen days on the road.\r\n\r\nVanderlyn has finished your picture in the most beautiful style\r\nimaginable. When it was done, he exclaimed with enthusiasm, \"There is\r\nthe best work I have ever done in America.\"\r\n\r\nYour letter must be addressed to Washington. The dear little boy, I\r\nhope, made a good sailor. Adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nNew-York, December 16, 1802.\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 26th November came yesterday, that of the 25th the\r\nday preceding. You see, therefore, that twenty-one days had elapsed\r\nfrom the time of your arrival to the receipt of your first letter.\r\nThis is not by way of reproach, for it is an unpleasant truth that,\r\nfor the last six or eight weeks, the Charleston mail has been twenty\r\ndays on the way. Had it not been for the intelligence by water of your\r\nsafe arrival, we should have concluded that you and Kate [1] were now\r\ndancing with Amphitrite. How jealous her majesty would have been at\r\nthe presence of two such rivals.\r\n\r\nThe day after you left us, though the weather was mild, not even a\r\nfrost, the leaves of the trees about the house began to fall, and in\r\nthree days they were as bare as in midwinter, though you may recollect\r\nthat you left them in perfect verdure. This, I am sure, was sympathy\r\nand regret. I shall respect these trees for their sensibility. It was\r\nin harmony with my feelings; for, truly, all was dreary.\r\n\r\nYes, I enter into all your little vexations; but while I write, and\r\nlong before, they probably have passed away, and are succeeded by new\r\nones. Kate will help you to laugh them off. Kiss her for me. Not a\r\nword, not a line from your husband since the 30th of October. We\r\nought, nay, we must, every day add something to our experience, and\r\nusually at some cost.\r\n\r\nI expect to leave this in about a week. Henceforth, therefore, address\r\nme at Washington. On my arrival there we will begin to talk of our\r\nspring and summer plans. You did well, very well to give up the\r\nColumbia project. I really wish you had given the pair of horses in\r\nyour own name. In all such cases, that which is most grateful to you\r\nwill be so to me. Butter shall be sent. The card plate must be\r\naltered.\r\n\r\n_Maybe_ I may write you from Philadelphia; not again from this city,\r\nunless I should receive from you something very pretty. Vanderlyn\r\nprojects to visit Charleston, but I am sure he will not. He is run\r\ndown with applications for portraits, all of which, without\r\ndiscrimination, he refuses. He is greatly occupied in finishing his\r\nNiagara views, which, --indeed, will do him honour. They will be four\r\nin number, and he thinks of having them engraved in France. You hear\r\nthe roaring of the cataract when you look at them. Kiss the dear\r\nlittle boy. Adieu, ma belle.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nWashington, January 26, 1803.\r\n\r\nYour last letter, and the only one received within a month, is dated\r\nthe 14th inst., and written, I suppose, at your plantation. It gives\r\nme the satisfaction of knowing that you and your boy are well, and\r\nnothing more. How long you are to remain there, where next to go, and\r\nevery thing leading to a knowledge of your occupations and intentions,\r\nis omitted. One half of the letter is a complaint of my silence, and\r\nthe other half (nearly) an apology for yours, You know (or am I now to\r\ntell you) that you and your concerns are the highest, the dearest\r\ninterest I have in this world; one in comparison with which all others\r\nare insignificant.\r\n\r\nRecollect, my dear Theodosia, that in five weeks Congress will adjourn\r\n(3d March); that I shall then go in some direction, but in what is yet\r\nunsettled; that my movements will depend essentially on yours. Tell\r\nme, therefore, where you are to pass the summer, when you are to leave\r\nCharleston, and all the details. If these matters should not yet be\r\nsettled, let it be forthwith done. If you are not to go northward, it\r\nis not probable that I shall see you in some time, for I have thoughts\r\nof going on a tour through the western country, which, if executed,\r\nwill consume the whole summer. I offer you and your family Richmond\r\nHill for the season, and will meet you there in May or June, or when\r\nyou please. Perhaps would come to make the voyage with you, by land or\r\nwater. Sullivan's Island will not, I hope, be thought of. How is it\r\nthat I have not a line from _Mari_, in answer to several letters which\r\nI wrote him from New-York?\r\n\r\nI entreat you to answer this letter distinctly, and in all its parts;\r\nfor there will not be time for another letter and reply before I shall\r\nbe off. My love to Kate. You do not say whether she grows handsome or\r\nugly, nor is it any matter which while on the plantation.\r\n\r\nI can't conceive how you all stow yourselves in that little wreck of a\r\nmansion. Please to write over, in some way, the erased part of your\r\nletter. You must be very destitute of wit and contrivance. No essence\r\nin Washington. I still prefer musk, but not to be had. One would think\r\nyou had suffered some injury from perfumes. Your message and\r\ncommission to Mrs. Madison will be delivered. My mode of life,\r\nestablishment, &c., are the same as last year, except that I bought a\r\nchariot, having some hope of seeing you and your husband here. As I\r\nshall not write again until I hear where you are, I may as well say\r\nnow all that occurs to me.\r\n\r\nOn my way through Philadelphia I rode out to Lansdown, to see our\r\nbeautiful little K. and Mrs. L. They appear to love you with all their\r\nhearts. K. especially talked of you with an interest which could not\r\nbe affected. The ladies find fault with her dress, her person, her\r\nmanners; in short, with every thing appertaining to her. Mrs. L. has\r\nalso her full share of the eulogium. K. is _toujours belle_. At\r\nWilmington I did not see friend S. She had gone to church. God bless\r\nthee.\r\n\r\nA. BURR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. JOHN COATS.\r\n\r\nWashington, February 23, 1803.\r\n\r\nIt is from me, my dear sir, that apologies are due; but you have\r\nkindly anticipated all I could make. I thank you for this instance of\r\nyour goodness; for your friendly recollection; above all, for the\r\njustice you do to my heart and feelings. Your last letter has been\r\nreceived. It is without date, and came by the mail of yesterday. You\r\nsee that I am resolved not to furnish a new occasion for apologies by\r\nfurther negligence. Whether, after the adjournment, I shall go North\r\nor South, is yet undetermined. If northward, I propose to take the\r\nroute which you had the goodness to describe, and to pass at least\r\nsome hours with you. I shall insist on a dish of lillipee, in order to\r\ngive a more dramatic effect to the review which we will take of past\r\nscenes.\r\n\r\nDearborn, now minister of war, was our fellow-traveller through the\r\nwilderness. If you will designate more particularly the papers you\r\nwish to recover, I will with pleasure make search for them. Accept, I\r\npray you, the assurance of my undiminished regard and esteem.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nClifton, March 17, 1802.\r\n\r\nEver since the date of my last letter, for it was not forwarded till\r\nsome days after, I have been quite ill; till within these two or three\r\ndays totally unable to write. The whole family, as well as myself, had\r\nbegun to think pretty seriously of my last journey; but, fortunately,\r\nI have had the pleasure of keeping them up a few nights, and drawing\r\nforth all their sensibility, without giving them the trouble of\r\nburying, mourning, &c.\r\n\r\nI was one night so ill as to have lost my senses in a great measure;\r\nabout daylight, as a last resource, they began plying me with old\r\nwine, and blisters to my feet. But, on recovering a little, I kicked\r\noff the blisters, and declared I would be dressed; be carried in the\r\nopen air, and have free use of cold water. I was indulged. I was\r\ncarried below, where I drank plentifully of cold water, and I had my\r\nface, neck, and arms bathed with it, and it assisted most\r\nastonishingly in recovering me. The day before yesterday I was put on\r\na bed in a boat and brought here. The change of air and scene have\r\nassisted me wonderfully. I am again getting well. Indeed, the rapidity\r\nwith which I gain strength surprises the whole family. The secret is,\r\nthat my constitution is good. I exert myself to the utmost, feeling\r\nnone of that pride, so common to my sex, of being weak and ill.\r\nDelicacy and debility are sometimes fascinating when affected by a\r\ncoquette, adorned with the freshness of health; but a pale, thin face;\r\nsunken, instead of languishing eyes; and a form, evidently tottering,\r\nnot gracefully bending, never, I suspect, made, far less could they\r\nretain a conquest, or even please a friend. I therefore encourage\r\nspirits, try to appear well, and am rewarded. In a few days I shall be\r\non the high road to health. Mari is well, and the boy charming. Adieu.\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, June 3, 1903.\r\n\r\nI have only to announce my safe arrival yesterday noon. Went forthwith\r\nto see the B.'s. They were all out of town. Will be back to-day.\r\n\r\nSend me the number of volumes of the American Encyclopedia. I wish to\r\ncomplete the set, and must, therefore, know the deficiencies. I have\r\nseen none of your acquaintance save the Biddles. To-morrow (if I\r\nshould in the mean time receive a letter from you) I shall add\r\nsomething. You are the two most spiritless young persons I ever knew.\r\nPray muster up energy enough to do something more than lounge on\r\nsofas. Go on Sunday to Ludlow's. Ask some of your friends often to\r\ndine with you. There is a little boy right opposite my window who has\r\nsomething of the way of \"mammy's treasure.\" Don't be jealous; not half\r\nso handsome. I have had him over to my room, and have already taught\r\nhim to _bang_. Adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nNew-York, June 4, 1803.\r\n\r\nEncore stupid. For Heaven's sake, what do you imagine I can find to\r\nsay once a day that is worth saying, shut up thus, either tinkling on\r\nthe harp or holding a tête-à-tête conversation? You must, indeed, have\r\na high opinion of my genius and the fertility of my imagination.\r\n\r\nPray how do you advance? Heavy business, is it not? I beg you will\r\nperform your promise, and write me the history of it. I'll bind it in\r\nred morocco, and keep it for the advantage and instruction of the boy.\r\nAdieu. Do not forget my commission, and return soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, June 5, 1803.\r\n\r\nI received yesterday your first letter. Pray no more apologies about\r\nyour stupidity, &c., because on that subject I am perfectly informed.\r\nBe pleased to recollect that your letters cannot be answered the day\r\nthey are received. We are now even. I wrote you on Friday.\r\n\r\nI went this morning to see L. and Keene. The former, as usual, polite,\r\nfriendly, and cheerful. The latter something improved by a very slight\r\nacquisition of embonpoint; so very slight, however, as not to be\r\nobvious to common optics. They will pass their summer at their present\r\nresidence, and I have almost promised that you shall make them a\r\nvisit.\r\n\r\nBut I should have narrated in the order of events according to their\r\ndates or in the order of the importance. Neither hath been observed,\r\nwhich argues ill of my temper of mind for the principal pursuit. Cette\r\n----- spoils me. From that intercourse I return faintly to the line of\r\nduty. On Friday I saw the inamorata, and it happened as we had feared;\r\nfor really I did not know whom I had the honour to address; nor could\r\nI, with certainty, discover during the interview, for I saw but one.\r\nThe appearance was pleasing. There was something pensive and\r\ninteresting. It exceeded my expectations. It was a visit of ceremony,\r\nand passed off as such. This day I met the whole four at dinner. My\r\nattentions were pointed, and met a cheerful return. There was more\r\nsprightliness than before. Le pere leaves town to-morrow for eight\r\ndays, and I am now meditating whether to take the fatal step\r\nto-morrow. I falter and hesitate, which you know is not the way. I\r\ntremble at the success I desire. You will not know my determination\r\ntill Wednesday. In the mean time I crave your prayers.\r\n\r\nI entreat you to ride about. Your monotonous life can never restore\r\nyour health; nay, it is hostile to recovery. The business part of my\r\njourney assumes some importance, but the result is uncertain. Adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, June 6, 1803.\r\n\r\nThe plot thickens, and I do not find it possible to communicate\r\nfaithfully the details, without hazarding too much in case of loss of\r\nthe letter. Something, however, may be said.\r\n\r\nI called at the house this morning; before I had asked for any one in\r\nparticular, the servant bid me in, and in a few minutes Inamorat sole\r\nappeared. This looked like secret understanding or sympathy; perhaps,\r\nhowever, it was only as head and representative of the family. She\r\nlooked well; but, unfortunately, a trifling carelessness in dress had\r\nnearly concluded the farce. Recollecting, however, that they were\r\npacking up for a temporary removal, to take place this very day, an\r\napology was obvious. Having made to myself the apology, I went\r\nfurther, and found that there was politeness, _at least_, in receiving\r\nme, and in so prompt an attendance under such circumstances. After ten\r\nminutes le pere came in; conversation became general, and I took\r\nleave.\r\n\r\nReturning home, and pondering on the subject most profoundly for full\r\nfive minutes, I boldly took up my pen, and wrote le pere that I wished\r\na few minutes' conversation with him at his own house in the course of\r\nthe day. Within an hour he was at _my room_ to receive the\r\ncommunication. Now paint to yourself a desperate miscreant on the\r\npoint of committing self-murder, trembling with anxiety, choking for\r\nwant of utterance, &c. Having formed the portrait to your own taste, I\r\nmust tell you that there was no such figure. The salutations, on\r\nmeeting, passed as usual. An expression or two of sensibility to the\r\ncourtesy which anticipated so promptly the intended visit, and then\r\nsome unembarrassed direct questions and monosyllabic answers. \"Is\r\n----- under any engagement?\" _None_. \"Would it be agreeable to you\r\nthat ----- should make overtures?\" &c. _Certainly_. A very\r\ncomplimentary thing, however, was said by le pere. It was agreed that\r\nthe suiter should make known his pretensions, he (le pere) declining\r\nto intermeddle. _End of the first act_.\r\n\r\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your two letters, both\r\ndated June 4. Evidently they cost you great labour.\r\n\r\nJune 7.\r\n\r\nI left this open that I might acknowledge the receipt of one by this\r\nmorning's mail. I am gratified to have it in my power. The accident to\r\nthe harp has been very fortunate, inasmuch as it enabled you to make\r\nout a long letter on the subject. However it may be broken, nothing is\r\nso easy to be repaired. Kiss dear little _bang_.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, June 7, 1803.\r\n\r\nAs you were informed yesterday, my _Celeste_ has gone with the family\r\n(le pere excepted) to pass a fortnight six miles from town. I go\r\nto-morrow morning to recommend myself; and that no time may be wasted,\r\nand these six mile rides may not be too often repeated to no purpose,\r\nI shall not go much round about the subject, but come pretty directly\r\nto the point; of all which you will be duly informed.\r\n\r\nTruly, if my head be as confused as my narrative, it will be of little\r\nuse to me in the negotiation. I should have begun by relating what\r\nhappened this morning. There are, however, two ways of telling a\r\nstory. One by beginning with the oldest event, and so travelling down\r\nto the close of the tale, and this is the mode commonly used by\r\nphilosophers and historians. The other, is by commencing with the most\r\nrecent fact or earliest incident, which is the mode universally\r\npractised by lovers, and, generally, by poets. I could even quote\r\nHomer and Virgil as authorities in support of this latter method.\r\nFurther I may add, that this retro-progressive arrangement seems more\r\ncongenial with the temper and feelings of the fair sex. Thus, you see,\r\nmost ladies turn first to the last chapter of a novel or romance. In\r\ndefence of this practice I could dilate to the utmost extent of many\r\nsheets; but, intending soon to publish an essay on the subject, I\r\nleave for the present the residue to your reflections, and return to\r\nthe interview of this morning.\r\n\r\nI was admitted without hesitation, and was presently joined by\r\nCeleste, though I had not particularized any one as the object of my\r\nvisit. For some minutes she led the conversation, and did it with\r\ngrace and sprightliness, and with admirable good sense. I made several\r\nattempts to divert it to other subjects--subjects which might have\r\nnearer affinity, again, to others; unsuccessfully, however; yet,\r\nwhether I was foiled through art or accident, I could not discover. Be\r\nassured she is much superior to l'ainée.\r\n\r\n  \"I would be wooed, and, not unsought, be won.\"\r\n\r\nSo I conjectured she thought, and she was right.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, June 8, 1803.\r\n\r\nI told you the negotiation should not be long. It is\r\nfinished--concluded--for ever abandoned--_liber sum_. Celeste never\r\nmeans to marry; \"firmly resolved.\" I am very sorry to hear it, madam;\r\nhad promised myself great happiness, but cannot blame your\r\ndetermination. \"No, certainly, sir, you cannot; for I recollect to\r\nhave heard you express surprise that any woman would marry, &c., and\r\nyou gave such reasons, and with so much eloquence, as made an\r\nindelible impression on my mind.\" Have you any commands to town,\r\nmadam? I wish you a good-morning. _End of the second and last act_.\r\n\r\nThe interview was about an hour. Celeste was greatly agitated;\r\nbehaved, however, with great propriety. The parting was full of\r\ncourtesy, and there is reason to hope that there will be no hanging or\r\ndrowning.\r\n\r\nI dined to-day chez Rush. The two elder daughters are in Canada. The\r\nlittle Julia, now about ten, is growing up very lovely and _tres\r\ngentile_. Afterward called to see your friend, Mrs. Stewart, and her\r\nbeautiful daughter. She is really beautiful. To-morrow I dine chez la\r\nRaz.\r\n\r\nThe law business goes on slowly; may be finished about Tuesday next,\r\nafter which I shall hasten to those who love me, when I shall\r\nendeavour to rouse them from their lethargy, and give them a little\r\nzest for life. Just now I recollect that I have no letter from you\r\nthis morning, at which I was confoundedly vexed. I stop, therefore,\r\nand shall withhold even this for a day, by way of punishment. You will\r\nsay that you were not well, that you were engaged in company, that the\r\nservant neglected to take the letter, or some such trite thing. All\r\nnonsense. Bon soir.\r\n\r\nThursday morning.\r\n\r\nYour letter of Tuesday, containing the history of the dinner, is\r\nreceived this morning. Truly, I think that Mr. and Mrs. Moore and Clem\r\nmight, with any tolerable aid, have made the dinner gay. Mr. and Mrs.\r\nMoore have both a great deal of wit, and are both well bred. Clem is\r\nby no means deficient. It must, therefore, have been the fault of\r\nyourself and husband. If the harp is not essentially injured, I would\r\nnot purchase a new one.

They made\r\nme laugh, yet I pity you, and have really a fellow feeling for you.\r\nPoor little Rippy, so you are mortgaged! But you bear it charmingly;\r\ndo you think this courage will last, or is it only a spasm? Spasmodic\r\nlove. It is really quite new. The trifling incident in relation to\r\ndress you must pardon. I am a _connoisseur_ in these things, and can\r\nassure you they are very pardonable.\r\n\r\nI am all anxiety and impatience for to-day's mail. But it surprises me\r\nthat _primo mobile_ is forgotten. Pray, have you lived altogether on\r\npepper? We shall ride to Montalto this afternoon, and you shall know\r\nour reception.

The farce of\r\neight days past had been forgotten, or recollected only as a dream.\r\n\r\nJust as I sit down to write to you I receive a note from Celeste,\r\nadvising me that she is in town for a few hours, and will be happy to\r\nsee me. What in the name of love and matrimony can this mean? The\r\nconclusion was definitive, and a mutual promise that neither would\r\never renew the subject. I am all impatience, and I go to hear.

When we repose it requires a great exertion to\r\nmove us, and when put in motion we go on.\r\n\r\nMy interruption last evening prevented me from wishing you joy at the\r\ndeclaration of independence.

The result only was stated in a former letter. It would\r\nhave required too much time to compress into the compass of one or two\r\nsheets a conversation of two hours. The details are therefore omitted;\r\nbut a circumstance which will increase your surprise at the incident\r\nrelated yesterday morning is, that, on Wednesday night, Reubon\r\nreceived by the hands of a servant of Celeste, sent for the sole\r\npurpose seven miles, a letter from her, couched in civil terms, but\r\nexpressing \"an unalterable determination never to listen again to his\r\nsuit, and requesting that the subject might never be renewed.\" Reubon\r\nreturned home late last evening, and was told that a boy had been\r\nthree times in the course of the afternoon and evening to deliver him\r\na message, but refused to say from whom he came. The last time the\r\nservant of Reubon traced the boy to the house of Celeste in town. It\r\nwas not known that Celeste had been that day in town, and no\r\nconjecture could be formed as to the owner of the boy or the object of\r\nhis message. The note received by Reubon this morning explains the\r\nmystery. The letter which I wrote you by the mail left Reubon puzzling\r\nhis brain to discover the meaning of that note, and just going out to\r\nobey the challenge which it conveyed. He went, as you were apprized,\r\nand has just now returned and communicated what you shall now hear.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, a worthy country judge, having heard a cause very\r\ningeniously debated by lawyers on each side, when he came to charge\r\nthe jury, did it in the words following: \"Gentlemen of the jury, you\r\nmust get along with this cause as well as you can; for my part, I am\r\nswamp'd.\" Now Reubon is exactly in the case of this judge, and I am at\r\na loss what to advise him. You could unravel this thing in five\r\nminutes. Would to God you were here; but to the story.\r\n\r\nHe found Celeste with a visitor; some female neighbour, who sat a full\r\nhalf hour. Celeste betrayed considerable agitation when Reubon came\r\nin, and the most palpable impatience at the long stay of the lady\r\nvisitor. At length she went, and the parties were alone. As she had\r\ndesired the interview, it was her place to speak first. After a pause\r\nand several efforts, she, with some trepidation, said that she feared\r\nthe letter which she had writen had not been expressed in terms\r\nsufficiently polite and respectful; she had wished an opportunity to\r\napologize; and here she stuck. Reubon ought in mercy and in politeness\r\nto have taken up the conversation; but he, expecting no such thing,\r\nwas taken by surprise, and remained dumb, with a kind of half grin.\r\nThe duette, at this moment, would have made a charming subject for the\r\npencil of Vanderlyn. Celeste was profoundly occupied in tearing up\r\nsome roses which she held in her hand, and Reubon was equally\r\nindustrious in twirling his hat, and pinching some new corners and\r\nangles in the brim. At length he recovered himself so far as to gain\r\nutterance. He denied, plumply, that there was want of politeness or\r\nrespect in the letter; and, after many awkward detours and\r\nhalf-finished sentences, he said he would return the letter, and would\r\nconsider it as cancelling the determination which it contained, and\r\nproposed to call on her in the country to-morrow morning to renew his\r\nsuit. This was _faintly_ opposed. He changed the course of\r\nconversation, without insisting on a formal permission or refusal, and\r\nthen went into the subject of celibacy and matrimony, and passed an\r\nhour tête-à-tête. It may be worth noting that, towards the close of\r\nthe conversation, some one knocked, and that she went out and ordered\r\nthe servant to deny her, from which it may be inferred that she was\r\nnot disagreeably engaged, and that she did not wish to be interrupted.\r\n\r\nNow, ma Minerve, is not this a very ridiculous posture for so grave an\r\naffair? And is not Reubon in a way to be coquetted, with his eyes\r\nopen? I rather think he erred in giving to the apology of Celeste any\r\nother meaning than she literally expressed. Thus he might have\r\ncompelled her to be more explicit. On the other hand, if she did in\r\nfact repent, and so suddenly, it would seem too harsh and fastidious\r\nto shut the door against all treaty and negotiation. Upon the whole,\r\nhowever, I conclude that if she wished, for any kind reason, to\r\nretreat, she should have gone further, and held out something like\r\nencouragement; in short, have met him half way. It may, I know, be\r\nreplied, that her habits of life and singular education forbid every\r\nthing like advance; and that a lady may always presume that her lover,\r\nif sincere, will seize the slightest ground for hope; and that, in the\r\nlogic of love, an equivocal refusal is assent. Certainly, this last\r\ninterview has been illy managed on the part of Reubon, but I have not\r\nyet resolved what to advise. This is left open till morning, when\r\nperhaps a word may be added.\r\n\r\nSaturday morning.\r\n\r\nFrom the state of things it is obvious that there can, at this hour,\r\nbe no new fact to communicate; but I have no longer any doubts as to\r\nthe meaning of the late scene, nor as to the line of conduct to be\r\npursued by Reubon. The note of Celeste is one of those trifling\r\nincidents which are too small for calculation, which may have arisen\r\nfrom the trifling motive assigned. Perhaps from a little spirit of\r\ncoquetry, perhaps a mere piece of sport. He shall, therefore, take no\r\nfurther notice of it; not even to go out this morning to see her, as\r\nhe had solicited and engaged; and, when he shall next meet her, make\r\nsome slight apology. Thus the thing is settled.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, June 12, 1803.\r\n\r\nI am weary, and so must you be, of this story of Reubon and Celeste.\r\nIt is, however, closed, and you will, after this letter, hear no more\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nReubon agreed to comport himself in the manner advised in my last.\r\nImmediately after this determination, Celeste sent a servant to inform\r\nhim that she was in town! He called to see her; returned the offensive\r\nletter, and told her that, as he understood that it was the manner and\r\nnot the substance of the letter which had induced her to recall it, it\r\nwould be quite unnecessary for her to take the trouble of writing\r\nanother. They talked of indifferent matters. Reubon, quite at ease,\r\nplayed the man of the world, and, in my opinion, the man of sense.\r\nBefore they parted, her face was flushed like a full-blown rose. She\r\nbegged his permission to destroy the letter, which was certainly a\r\nvery useless request, considering that the letter was wholly in her\r\npower. During the interview, Celeste, having no roses to occupy her\r\nhands, twisted off two corners of a pocket-handkerchief.\r\n\r\nThis reference (the law business), of which I informed you something,\r\nhas become extremely troublesome and disagreeable. I am apprehensive\r\nthat it will detain me here nearly the whole of this week.\r\n\r\nBinny looks remarkably well, and talks much about you. Dennis and\r\nwife, from Savannah, are here. _Madame est toujours belle_. I can't\r\nexpress to you my impatience to be with you, your husband, and little\r\none. Truly I think with horror of passing five days more here. Pray\r\nform no plans of distant rides until my return.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nNew-York, June 14, 1803.\r\n\r\nAs to Celeste, _voila mon_ opinion. She meant, from the beginning, to\r\nsay that awful word--_yes_; but not choosing to say it immediately,\r\nshe told you that _you_ had furnished her with arguments against\r\nmatrimony, which in French means, Please, sir, to persuade me out of\r\nthem again. But you took it as a plump refusal, and walked off. She\r\ncalled you back. What more could she do? I would have seen you to\r\nJapan before I should have done so much. I still, however, like your\r\nplan. My opinion is not, perhaps, well founded, and it is best to be\r\non the safe side. If she is determined to be kind, she will find out a\r\nway of expressing it, or she is not worth having. I am quite pleased\r\nwith her, and am waiting the arrival of the mail with the utmost\r\nimpatience.\r\n\r\n\"Treasure\" is well, notwithstanding all predictions on my folly in his\r\ndress. You must be home for my birthday, (the 20th inst.), or I'll\r\nnever forgive you; or, rather, I shall not spend it pleasantly.\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, June 16, 1803.\r\n\r\nNo letter by this mail; being the fourth omission and violation of\r\npromise since the 1st inst.\r\n\r\nThe birthday must be kept. It shall be \"honoured by my presence.\" You\r\nwill therefore make your preparations, and, among other articles for\r\nyour feast or party, I recommend two fiddlers, not barbecued or\r\nroasted, but _en plein vie_.\r\n\r\nIf this should be received on Friday morning, in season to be answered\r\nby that day's mail, I beg to have a line from you, if only a _bon\r\njour_; after which, no more letters can be received. You shall not\r\nhave any distant parties or jaunts until I can partake. I am even\r\njealous of the Fort Washington tour. Indeed, you can't go there\r\nwithout me, for no one can so well show you the ground.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Kane and his wife (late Miss Clarke) should be in town, pray\r\ncall on them immediately, and make them and the sister of the party.\r\nRecollect they have many claims to your civilities. His sister, Mrs.\r\nThomas Morris, was very kind to you at Genesee. Mr. Kane himself\r\noverwhelmed us with good offices on a certain occasion at Albany, and\r\nthe frequent hospitalities of John Innes Clarke can never be\r\nforgotten. Be prompt, therefore, and courteous.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nBallston, July 20, 1803.\r\n\r\nBehold us, _cher pere_, at this fountain of health; and now my only\r\nwish is to leave it as soon as possible. On arriving here we found\r\nthat your letter to H. Walton had not been received; but we have been\r\nvery fortunate in getting a house entirely to ourselves, and one quite\r\nas pleasantly situated as that you mentioned. Mr. Walton has been\r\nextremely polite to us. We dined there on Monday, and in the evening\r\nwent to a ball, which surpassed my expectations in brilliancy. I\r\ndanced twice, but I am unable to tell you whether I looked well or\r\ndanced well; for you are the only person in the world who says any\r\nthing to me about my appearance. Mari generally looks pleased, but\r\nrarely makes remarks. On my return, therefore, I wished for you to\r\nlearn some account of myself; for vanity and diffidence had a combat\r\nin which each so well maintained its ground that the affair is still\r\nleft undecided.\r\n\r\nGeneral Smith and family are here. Never was ennui more strongly\r\ndepicted than in the countenance of madame and sister. They appear\r\nabsolutely bereft of every thing like exertion. Mr. -----, on the\r\ncontrary, while he owns that this is not one of the most pleasant\r\nplaces he has ever seen, is still lively and agreeable. Such are the\r\nbaneful effects of our education. Put out of our usual sphere of\r\nacquaintance, or the old routine of amusement and occupation, we\r\nrarely have knowledge of the world enough to discover any pleasant\r\nqualification that may exist in a stranger, and to put it to any use\r\nif it obtrude itself on our notice; and still less are we taught to\r\ncreate amusements for ourselves.\r\n\r\nThe boy is pretty well, but I confess I have many doubts as to the\r\nhealthiness of this place for children. Every morning since our\r\narrival there has been a thick mist, which the sun does not disperse\r\ntill nine or ten o'clock. I kiss you with all my heart.\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM CHARLES BIDDLE.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, February 3, 1803.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nThe business of New-Orleans is much talked of here. In my opinion, and\r\nit is the opinion of many others, we should immediately take\r\npossession, and then treat about it. We have no business to make\r\nexcuses for the conduct of the Spanish government, by saying that they\r\ngave no orders to treat us in this manner. For my own part I do not\r\nfear a war with France and Spain. We could do more injury to them than\r\nthey could do us. If we were at war with them, and Great Britain did\r\nnot join us, we should have our ports filled with their seamen, and\r\nthe coasts of France and Spain would soon swarm with our cruisers.\r\n\r\nI remember, just before the commencement of the revolutionary war, my\r\nmother was disputing with an English officer. He said the Americans,\r\nof right, should not go to war; they could do nothing; they could get\r\nno person to head them. She replied, that the Americans would have no\r\ndifficulty in finding some person to command their army; that she had\r\nseven sons, and, if necessary, would lead them herself to oppose their\r\narmy. _Two_ of her sons fell during the war in the service of their\r\ncountry. I have seven sons, whom I would much sooner lead to the field\r\nthan suffer our country to be insulted. Your friend,\r\n\r\nCHARLES BIDDLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM JOHN TAYLOR, OF CAROLINA.\r\n\r\nVirginia, near Port Royal, March 25, 1803,\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nBy your note from the Bowling Green I find you are under two mistakes.\r\nOne, that I am a candidate for Congress; the other, that I am making a\r\nbook. As to the first, I have withstood all solicitation; and,\r\nalthough a few gentlemen have been pleased, without my knowledge, to\r\nmake a stir, as it is called, nothing will come of it, and the old\r\ncolonel will once more be felicitated.\r\n\r\nAs to the second, writing is one of my amusements, but in a wild,\r\ncareless, and desultory way. Judge, then, how unlikely such scraps are\r\nto come out a book. Not that I would hesitate to publish any thing\r\nwhich might do these people good, however it might effect my own name,\r\nabout which the fifty years which have passed over my head have\r\nrendered me quite indifferent. My time goes along tolerably enough,\r\none way or another. Fancy furnishes me with passions and amusements,\r\nand about one hundred dollars a year more than meets every want I have\r\nwhich money can gratify.\r\n\r\nThis election affair has, however, exposed me to five or six essays in\r\nthe newspapers, composed of lies, malice, and nonsense. One writer (an\r\nold tory) charges yourself and Colonel Smith with having met in caucus\r\nhere, to plot the expulsion of Anthony New from Congress. I would have\r\ngiven five guineas had you called again, for it is probable you would\r\nhave met Smith at my gate, and another pretty piece would have\r\nappeared most prodigiously entertaining. Well, if you will call in\r\nJune, I will give you a hearty welcome to the best I have. May you be\r\nhappy.\r\n\r\nYour friend,\r\n\r\nJOHN TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM PIERCE BUTLER.\r\n\r\nNear Darien, Georgia, March 30, 1803.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nThe letter you did me the honour of writing, with the accompaniments\r\nyou so kindly forwarded, have my warm and grateful acknowledgments.\r\nThe selection of _ten miles square_ for the seat of government\r\nappeared to me at the time, and has continued, an excrescence on the\r\nConstitution, like a wart on a fair skin. Neither the foreign\r\nministers nor the resident citizens in the federal city have any thing\r\nto alarm them under state laws. There is no finger of blood in the\r\nlaws of Maryland or Virginia. I am of Mr. Bacon's opinion--return the\r\nsovereignty to the states. I hope we shall preserve peace with Spain.\r\nI observe, with much gratification, that the debates in Congress are\r\nmuch more decorous than they were last session.\r\n\r\nThe object or end of Mr. Monroe's mission I am ignorant of, as I do\r\nnot correspond with any public character but yourself. I suppose an\r\nexplanation with France respecting New-Orleans. I leave my farm in a\r\nfew days for Philadelphia, where it would afford me pleasure to see\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nYour friend,\r\n\r\nP. BUTLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nNew-York, July 30, 1803.\r\n\r\nIt was kind to announce to me, by the earliest opportunity, your safe\r\narrival at Lebanon. Tell me more precisely the movements and\r\nintentions of the family, as they will in some measure control mine. I\r\nam negotiating for the possession of Richmond Hill, by exchanging with\r\nColonel F. for my house in town. It will be interesting indeed to have\r\nyou and your boy at the house where you have been once so happy. We\r\nwill trace back our childish sports and our more grave amusements. In\r\nthe sale of this estate I reserve the house and a due portion of the\r\nground about it; yet a good price will tempt me to part with it.\r\n\r\nSome obscure hints in one of your letters have saddened my heart. From\r\n_son pere_ I have merited neither suspicion nor reserve. Is it, then,\r\ncriminal that a person of mature age should converse on a subject most\r\nhighly interesting with the friend most likely informed? Yet did I not\r\neven give advice; invariably and inflexibly I declared that I would\r\nnever interfere in the matter unless son pere concurred. Have you\r\nforgotten the mad project of going to England? the anxiety and misery\r\nit cost us for some days? I should have thanked the man who had thus\r\ntreated my child. Indeed, my dear Theodosia, such things sink into my\r\nsoul. They seem to invade the very sanctuary of happiness. Had I any\r\nthing so much at heart as to render him happy? That I love him, you\r\nbest know. God bless my dear Theodosia.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nProvidence, R. I., August 1, 1803.\r\n\r\nI left New-York two days after you, that is, on Saturday, and had a\r\npretty little passage of forty-eight hours. We were, on board, a\r\nBritish custom-house officer, a sensible, pleasant man, who played\r\nchess with me; two ladies, rather pretty, who did not molest us,\r\n_point exigentes_, bien amiable; five little children, who neither\r\ncried nor quarrelled the whole way! yet cheerful and playful.\r\n\r\nSix days have I passed here very pleasantly. To-morrow I go, whither\r\nis not determined. You may, however, address me at New-York, which\r\nwill most probably be my destination.\r\n\r\nAll those you saw when you were last here inquire about you with great\r\ncivility and interest, and say pretty things of you. Don't be vain,\r\nmadam, for I take this to be a kind of flattery to me, or to be so\r\nintended. Miss C. talks much of you, and L. N., and Miss A. Can you\r\nimagine what are Miss C.'s occupations and arrangements? Never; so\r\nI'll tell you. Why, she instructs two nieces and a nephew (things of\r\ntwelve or thirteen) in astronomy, natural philosophy, and principles\r\nof botany! Her boudoir has globes, several mathematical instruments,\r\n&c. All this I discovered by accident; for she denies it all most\r\nstrenuously, and with some pretty, unaffected embarrassment. Be\r\nassured this is an amiable, sensible girl. I don't believe you know\r\nher value: so I pray you to study her. She left town yesterday with\r\nher mother for Lebanon. Mr. C. went on Friday to New-York. What care\r\nyou for all that?\r\n\r\nAre you a good girl? Do you drink the waters, and bathe, and ride, and\r\nwalk? I hear Mrs. W. is handsomer than during her widowhood, of which\r\nI am very glad. Mr. Russel left this on Thursday, intending to pass\r\nthrough Albany and Ballston on his way to Niagara. If he should come\r\ninto your vicinage, desire Mr. Alston to recollect him. His wife is\r\nwith him. I never saw her.\r\n\r\nTell me who you see, and what you do, and what are your plans. You had\r\nbest return by Boston and Providence if you should have time. Can you\r\nmake little _chose_ drink the water? I dare say not. If I were there I\r\nwould force some down his little throat. God bless you all.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nNew-York, August 6, 1803.\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 20th of July was received from the postoffice on my\r\narrival last evening. There must be some anachronism in the date, for\r\nyou left New-York on the 21st. I learn, however, that you arrived,\r\nwere well, and had danced. Lord, how I should have liked to see you\r\ndance. It is so long; how long is it? It is certain that you dance\r\nbetter than anybody and looked better. Not a word of the Spring\r\nwaters, their effects, &c.\r\n\r\nI made the journey from Providence by land in four days. Near town,\r\nyesterday, P.M., I met Mr. and Mrs. Harper, of Baltimore. They are to\r\nbreakfast with me this morning; so I must make haste, for it is now\r\neight o'clock. How bad I write to-day. With Mr. and Mrs. Harper was a\r\npretty-looking, black-eyed lass, whose name I did not hear. I hope she\r\nis coming out to breakfast, for I like her. There was also that\r\nLiverpool merchant, who used to hang on Butler so in Charleston. I\r\nhope he won't come.\r\n\r\nI wrote you from Providence, on Monday last, all I had to say of it\r\nand its inhabitants. I found the whole country, from Providence to\r\nthis place, greatly alarmed about the yellow fever, said to be in\r\nNew-York, and dreadful stories in circulation, as usual. There have\r\nbeen some suspicious cases, and some decided instances of yellow\r\nfever. Our practising physicians, however, our mayor and\r\npolice-officers deny its existence. There is no alarm in town. The\r\ncoffee-house is attended as usual. This length of intolerable heat\r\nhas, I fear, prepared an atmosphere for the kind reception, if not for\r\nthe generation of the fever. Now I hear the carriage. _Bon jour_. Be a\r\ngood girl. Love to H. 'Twas nothing but a cart.\r\n\r\nL. and her little bang are here (_chez nous_); how happy are you\r\nmothers. She will descant on its beauties by the hour; will point them\r\nout to you distinctly, lest they might escape notice. The hair, the\r\nnose, the mouth, and, in short, every feature, limb, and muscle, is\r\nadmirable and is admired. To all which I agreed.\r\n\r\nJerome Bonaparte is not here; nor is it certain that he is on the\r\ncontinent. The French consul, whom I met in the road, told me, with\r\n_une maniere mysterieuse_, that he had something to communicate on\r\nthat subject. Maybe he is come, maybe he isn't. I conjecture that he\r\nis come or coming.\r\n\r\nHere they come, in earnest. I see only one lady in the carriage; so\r\nmiss has not come; well, she may stay.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nNew-York, August 8, 1803.\r\n\r\nYour amiable letter of the 1st inst. has not yet come to hand, and\r\ntherefore cannot yet be acknowledged; perhaps it has not yet been\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\nIndeed, we are about to be scourged with the plague called yellow\r\nfever. John Bard dead; but, to keep the account good, Billy B. has\r\ntwins (boys). Catharine Church Cruger (Mrs. Peter C.) has a son. But\r\nof the deaths. We die reasonably fast. Six or eight new cases reported\r\nyesterday. Of those who take the fever three fourths die. The\r\ncoffee-house was, nevertheless, pretty well attended. No appearances\r\nof alarm until to-day. Several families have removed from the\r\nneighbourhood of the Tontine Coffee-house, and five times the number\r\nwill remove to-morrow. Laight claimed Mr. Alston's promise of\r\nMontalto, and I have admitted his pretensions. He will take possession\r\nto-morrow or next day. Our pretty (beautiful) Mrs. Talbot, late Miss\r\nTruxton, more lately Mrs. Cox, is in my neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nI write in town, and in the most outrageous hurry, having nothing to\r\ndo, but having, according to custom, omitted writing till the moment\r\nof closing the mail. Mr. and Mrs. Harper did come, and with them that\r\nblack-eyed young lady, which proved to be Miss Chase, of Baltimore.\r\nMr. ----- came also.\r\n\r\nDo you know Miss Joanna Livingston? Pray recollect all her good and\r\namiable qualities. Reflect profoundly. Adieu, ma chere amie.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nWashington, October 16, 1803.\r\n\r\nWe arrived here yesterday somewhat fatigued. I was, however, very\r\nhappy to find myself at Washington, for we had, in the morning, been\r\nnear taking quite a different route. Some part of our harness having\r\nbroken on the top of a pretty long descent, fortunately the leaders\r\nwere frightened by the wheel horses crowding on them; and running\r\naside, one got his leg over the pole and was stopped, or you would not\r\nhave had the pleasure of receiving this interesting scribleriad, and\r\nthe _poor world_ would have been deprived of the heir-apparent to all\r\nits admiration and glory.\r\n\r\nOur friend L. I have not seen. She was not to be seen. She has gone to\r\nLancaster, and intends returning by the way of Harper's Ferry. Her\r\njourney is taken with a view to recruit herself after a severe attack\r\nof the bilious fever; with which, also, her little daughter has been\r\nat the point of death--literally, I am told. Lest I might lose the\r\npleasure of seeing her by some mistake, I would not trust to the\r\ninformation of Tunnecliffe as to her absence, but made him send\r\ndirectly to her house. There; is not that little incident related in\r\nthe true heroic style? Mrs. Madison and myself have made an\r\ninterchange of visits to-day. She is still pretty; but oh, that\r\nunfortunate propensity to snuff-taking. We drank tea with Mr. and Mrs.\r\nGallatin by invitation. Nobody asked us to eat. The markets are bad, I\r\nhear. We live very well, however, and, if you have not engaged\r\nlodgings, I advise to apply here also.\r\n\r\nTo-morrow takes us to Dumfries, and the next day beyond\r\nFredericksburgh. _Le pere_ is at Bowling Green. I bear travelling\r\nremarkably well. Headaches have disappeared, and my appetite\r\nincreases; but poor little _gampy_ does not like the confinement of\r\nthe carriage.\r\n\r\nOn inquiry, we find that the one-eyed Nicholas who was in Congress is\r\nnamed John, and has only three brothers, Wilson, Robert, and Normond;\r\nso your man is an impostor, consequently you have been imposed on and\r\ncheated out of fifty dollars. Wade Hampton arrived here this evening.\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nPetersburgh, October 21, 1803.\r\n\r\nWe reached this last night without any accident or even incident, but\r\nwith great fatigue. Mr. Alston appears so distressed and worn out with\r\nthe child's fretting, that it returns on me with redoubled force.\r\n\r\n_Le pere et frere_ are here. _Toujours honnête et bon_. They\r\nbreakfasted with us, for we are obliged to take separate lodgings, and\r\nmy husband has now gone to the races with them; a party of pleasure I\r\nwas very willing to resign for you and repose. The longer I live, the\r\nmore frequently the truth of your advice evinces itself, and never was\r\nthere any thing more true than that occupation is necessary to give\r\none command over themselves. I confess I feel myself growing quite\r\ncross on the journey, and it is really to be feared that, unless we\r\nsoon finish it, the serene tranquillity of my placid temper may be\r\ninjured. Novel reading has, I find, not only the ill effect of\r\nrendering people romantic, which, thanks to my father on earth, I am\r\nlong past, but they really furnish no occupation to the mind. A series\r\nof events follow so rapidly, and are interwoven with remarks so\r\ncommonplace and so spun out, that there is nothing left to reflect\r\nupon. A collection of images, which amuse only from their variety and\r\nrapid succession, like the pictures of a magic lantern; not like a\r\npiece of Vanderlyn, where the painter makes fine touches, and leaves\r\nto your vanity at least the merit of discovering them. Oh! would I had\r\nmy friend Sterne. Half he says has no meaning, and, therefore, every\r\ntime I read him I find a different one.\r\n\r\nThe boy has perfectly recovered. He remembers you astonishingly. He is\r\nconstantly repeating that you are gone, and calling after you. When I\r\ntold him to call Mr. Alston grandfather--\"Grandfather gone,\" says he.\r\nI kiss you from my heart.\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nLumberton, S. C., October 29, 1803.\r\n\r\nThank Heaven, my dear father, I am at Lumberton, and within a few days\r\nof rest. I am sick, fatigued, out of patience, and on the very brink\r\nof being out of temper. Judge, therefore, if I am not in great need of\r\nrepose. What conduces to render the journey unpleasant is, that it\r\nfrets the boy, who has acquired two jaw teeth since he left you, and\r\nstill talks of _gampy_. We travel in company with the two Alstons.\r\nPray teach me how to write two A's without producing something like an\r\n_Ass_.\r\n\r\nWe expect to reach Georgetown on the 1st of November. There we shall\r\nremain three or four days, and then proceed to Charleston. Adieu.\r\n_Mille baises_.\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nClifton, November 8, 1803.\r\n\r\nYou are surprised at my date, but my last must have prepared you for\r\nit in some degree. I received such warm and repeated solicitations to\r\ncome here, that I accepted. We came on the 3d, and shall remain here\r\ntill the day after to-morrow, when-oh!-oh! I go to Hagley, where we\r\nshall remain till Natalie's arrival, which will carry me to\r\nCharleston. It might appear ill-natured and ungrateful for the\r\nkindness John and Sally show me to regret residing at Hagley. But you,\r\nwho always put the best construction on my words and deeds, will\r\nallow, that a place in which we have suffered much and run a risk of\r\nsuffering more must be unpleasant.\r\n\r\nWe have visited the Oaks house since our arrival. The lazy workmen\r\nhave been wasting their time, and have not yet finished what two\r\nNorthern workmen would have done in a month. They are in the act of\r\nplastering, and that will not be dry enough to admit us in some time.\r\nThus I shall remain with John till Mr. Alston returns from Columbia.\r\nDo you not think we may safely enter the house then? The plastering\r\nwill be finished in less than a week hence; and the legislature, you\r\nknow, adjourns at Christmas. I am particular on this subject, because\r\nI have known persons to suffer much from inhabiting a house too newly\r\nfinished, and I wish to have your opinion.\r\n\r\nI am extremely anxious to hear from you. When we parted you were\r\nengaged in talking over a bargain with Mr. Astor. Pray tell me the\r\nevent of your deliberations. I had almost forgotten to tell you that\r\nwe have every prospect of a capital crop.\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nNew-York, November 7, 1803.\r\n\r\nYour letter from Chester was received in due time; that from\r\nWashington came only yesterday, having lain there fourteen days before\r\nit was put into the office. By this time you must have received all\r\nthose which I have written to you since your departure--not a single\r\none. This is the first time that I have put pen to paper at you; but I\r\nhave been too busy, selling. All is sold, and well sold; not all,\r\nhowever. The house, outhouses, and some three or four acres remain.\r\nEnough to keep up the appearance, and all the pleasant recollections\r\nof your infantine days, and some of your matronly days also, are\r\nreserved with interest. This weighty business, however, is completed,\r\nand a huge weight it has taken from the head and shoulders, and every\r\nother part, animal and intellectual, of A. B.\r\n\r\nMr. M'Kinnon wrote me, last June, a letter, which I received a few\r\ndays ago, and with it came two shawls or cloaks (a kind of worked\r\nmuslin, all the rage in Paris and London at that date), some visiting\r\ncards, and ornamented message paper. Half his letter is to you and of\r\nyou. He begs you to accept one of the shawls, and to give Frances the\r\nother. I executed his instructions by giving F. one. Surely it is not\r\nworth while to send the other to the Oaks for the admiration of your\r\nAfricans. It is, in my opinion, beautiful; though, at first sight, I\r\nthought so little of it that I was going to give it to Peggy or Nancy.\r\nOf the cards I enclose a sample.\r\n\r\nIf little _gamp_ could read, I should write to him volumes. I find my\r\nthoughts straying to him every hour in the day, and think more of him\r\ntwenty fold than of you two together. Mrs. Laight and child are well.\r\nThey move to town in six or eight days. Anna is well. Cath. C. la la.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nNew-York, November 22, 1803.\r\n\r\nMy last went by water, in care of young Gibbs, the baker's son, with\r\nthe curricle box, and some other articles which I have forgotten. The\r\nletter contained some samples of M'Kinnon's present. The shawl is\r\nstill retained as being too precious to be sent by sea or land. Is\r\nthis right?\r\n\r\nMr. Astor left with me some days ago for Mr. Alston a very beautiful\r\nmap of Lower Canada, price _ten_ dollars, and two views of Montreal\r\nand its vicinity, _two guineas_. I am particularly charged by Mr.\r\nAstor to inform Mr. Alston that his landlord at Montreal paid to him\r\n(Mr. Astor), for the account of Joseph Alston, Esq., the sum of _one\r\nhalf guinea_; the said landlord having discovered, after the departure\r\nof the said Joseph Alston _et ux_., that they had not taken with them\r\ntwo bottles of Madeira wine which the said landlord had charged in the\r\nbill of the said Joseph Alston, and for which he had received payment.\r\nThus I have discharged myself of a commission which has been enjoined\r\nupon me at least ten times.\r\n\r\nRoger Morris's place, the large handsome house on the height beyond\r\nMrs. Watkins, is for sale. I can get it for Richmond Hill with _four_\r\nacres. Shall I exchange? R. M.'s has one hundred and thirty acres. If\r\nI leave Richmond Hill, however, had I not better buy in town, that you\r\nmay have a resting-place there ? Dear little _gampy_; tell me a great\r\ndeal about him, or I shall not value your letters. Indeed, I will\r\nreturn them unopened. Is not that good Irish?\r\n\r\nMr. Law has arrived. Miss Wheeler [1] is also at Washington, and A. B.\r\nat New-York-_tant mieux_. Would you think it? I have been coquetted by\r\na rich widow, and really I had some thoughts of yielding.\r\n\r\nJerome Bonaparte is here, and he will keep me three days to dine him.\r\nWe have exchanged visits, but have not yet met. I think I have mixed\r\nup here every thing I have to say to T. B. A. or J. A. No one word of\r\npolitics; but, on further reflection, Mari will be at Columbia when\r\nthis arrives.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nWashington, December 4, 1803.\r\n\r\nI arrived this afternoon, and found here your three letters from\r\nPetersburgh, Lumberton, and Georgetown. The last is dated the 2d of\r\nNovember. How very long ago. These letters are very satisfactory,\r\nexcept on the article of your health; of that you must speak a little\r\nmore plainly. How long are you to stay in Charleston? Without knowing\r\nthis, I am at a loss where to address you. I shall conclude that you\r\nwill remain there till the return of Mr. Alston from the legislature.\r\n\r\nThe manner of your letters pleases me \"prodigiously.\" There is ease,\r\ngood sense, and sprightliness. That from Petersburgh merits still\r\nhigher encomium. Tell dear little _gampy_ that I have read over his\r\nletter a great many times, and with great admiration. Mrs. Law, to\r\nwhom I showed it, thinks it a production of genius.\r\n\r\nThat good and ill fortune never come in single strokes, but in\r\nsequences, you have heard since you were four years old. Since we\r\nparted I have been almost daily surprised by some pleasant occurrence\r\nor discovery of a personal nature. I pray it may continue a little\r\nlonger; even till a bust is found and obtained.\r\n\r\nMrs. Law was vexed and mortified beyond measure at missing you. She\r\nhas bid me say more things than this sheet would hold. The Misses\r\nButler are all here. I shall see them to-morrow. Mary Allen, that was,\r\nnow Mrs. Livingston; that beautiful little Miss Gray, whom we saw in\r\nBoston; she became Mrs. Dobel, then a widow, and now Mrs. Payne.\r\n\r\nAt Philadelphia Mrs. Lenox and K. almost quarrelled with me for your\r\npassing their gate without calling. They had made some preparation,\r\nand, in good faith, desired your visit. Miss Boadley, too, talked of\r\nyou with great interest. At Wilmington I saw no one of your\r\nacquaintance; nor at Baltimore, except Susan Smith, who is there on a\r\nvisit from Princeton.\r\n\r\nTo go back to New-York. All things are much as you left them, except\r\nthat what regards gamp is a good deal better. Mrs. Laight, and child,\r\nand sisters all in good condition and in high spirits. Have already\r\nbeen dancing--I believe twice. At Mrs. General G.'s I met by accident\r\nMrs. Rogers. She is a pleasant, cheerful, comely woman, to appearance\r\nnot past thirty-eight or forty. You know we had heard otherwise.\r\nEustis has sprained his ankle, which puts him, for the present, out of\r\nthe gay world. I have not been abroad except to dine with Mrs. L. I am\r\nrejoiced at what you tell me of La Gree.\r\n\r\nPray take immediately in hand some book which requires attention and\r\nstudy. You will, I fear, lose the habit of study, which would be a\r\ngreater misfortune than to lose your head. M'Kinnon has sent me out a\r\nbeautiful picture of the celebrated Madame Ricammier. It is a good\r\ndeal like your pretty widow, Mrs. Wright. _Bon soir_.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nCharleston, November 19, 1803.\r\n\r\nAll your trouble, good precepts, and better example have been thrown\r\naway on me. I am still a child. Your letter of the 7th inst. reached\r\nme yesterday. Of course it made me very happy; but those pretty little\r\nplaythings from D. M'Kinnon delighted me. I looked at them over and\r\nover, with as much pleasure as a miser over his hoard. But you must\r\nsend me the shawl. I shall be down at the races, and want to have the\r\ngratification of displaying it.\r\n\r\nFrom my date and my last letter you imagine that Natalie is in town,\r\nbut you are mistaken. I came down in the hope of meeting her, and to\r\nbuy some furniture for the Oaks. Mari on business. I return to\r\nWaccamaw to-morrow morning early. My husband left me to-day for\r\nColumbia. He received your letter too late to answer it hence, but\r\nwill do so from Columbia. As for me, I am in the height of bustle and\r\nconfusion. Before seven this morning I had packed up two or three\r\ntrunks, and unpacked them all again. Is not that industry? I write as\r\nif I were in a hurry. You may perceive the state of my head and house\r\nfrom the style of my letter. More from Hagley. Good-by.\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nWashington, December 6, 1803.\r\n\r\nSince closing a letter to you last evening, I have received two more,\r\n8th and 19th of November. You are a good girl to write so often. Oh,\r\nyes! I knew how much of a child you were when I sent the pretty\r\nthings. Just such another child is _son pere_.\r\n\r\nI write from my breakfast-table, having not yet been abroad, and\r\nhaving denied myself to everybody. I have, therefore, nothing now to\r\nsay, and should not so soon have _troubled_ you again, but for that\r\npart of your letter which speaks of the condition of your house. I\r\nhasten to say that, in my opinion, your house will not be a fit or\r\nhealthy residence for your boy before the middle of April or 1st of\r\nMay. The walls may, to the touch, appear dry in three or four weeks;\r\nbut shut up any room for twelve or twenty-four hours, and enter before\r\nit be aired, you will meet an offensive, and, as I believe, a\r\npernicious effluvia; an air totally unfit for respiration, unelastic,\r\nand which, when inhaled, leaves the lungs unsatisfied. This is the air\r\nyou will breathe if you inhabit the house. I could, perhaps, show\r\nchymically how the atmosphere of the closed rooms becomes thus azotic,\r\nbut I prefer to submit to the test of your senses.\r\n\r\nThe shawl shall be ordered on, since you will risk it. Yes, go to the\r\nraces, and appear to be amused. Be more social.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nWashington, December 9, 1803.\r\n\r\nWhen any thing amuses me, my first thought is whether it would not\r\nalso amuse you; and the pleasure is but half enjoyed until it is\r\ncommunicated. The enclosed has suggested this prologue.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I did not tell you that Kate made breakfast for Bonaparte one\r\nmorning at my house: a breakfast _à la François_, at twelve o'clock.\r\nOf four ladies, she was the only one who spoke French, and she really\r\nseemed inspired. No Parisian could have been more fluent, graceful, or\r\nsprightly.\r\n\r\nI have nothing to add of A. B., nor of any of the rest of the\r\nalphabet; and my breakfast being on table, farewell.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nClifton, December 1, 1803.\r\n\r\nI have been here about a week, _cher pere_. Since your letter by\r\nGibbs, have not received a line from you. I do not know whether to be\r\nmost sorry or mad: a little of both troubles me at present; but, to\r\npunish you for your silence, I will not tell you which preponderates.\r\nPray write to me immediately.\r\n\r\nOn the morning after writing to you in Charleston, I set off for the\r\ncountry, as determined on; and, since my arrival, have learned that\r\nNatalie was at my house in less than three hours after my departure.\r\nSumter's business will not allow him time to come here, so that I\r\nshall go there. William drives me down in his curricle, and we shall\r\nset off to-day--this morning--now. The flat is in the canal; the\r\ncurricle on board; my clothes not yet packed up; so good-by. Before I\r\nfinish I must tell you that I have again heard from La Greque; she is\r\nastonishingly improved in appearance, so say others, and is very\r\nhappy. She has sent me a Parisian bonnet, two beautiful handkerchiefs,\r\nand a pair of walking shoes. To the boy a French and English library;\r\nand to Mari a beautiful little golden candlestick, and wax tapers to\r\nlight his segar.\r\n\r\nMy health is infinitely improved, and I attribute it to nothing but\r\nthe continual bustle I have been kept in for three weeks past. What a\r\ncharming thing a bustle is. Oh, dear, delightful confusion. It gives a\r\ncirculation to the blood, an activity to the mind, and a spring to the\r\nspirits.\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nWashington, December 27, 1803.\r\n\r\nIndeed, indeed, my dear little Theodosia, I will write to you very\r\nsoon. Don't scold and pout so, and I will tell you _how_ I visited\r\nAnnapolis, and _how_ I returned about an hour ago. All that, however,\r\nmay be told in half a line. I went and returned in my own little\r\ncoachee. But what I did and who I saw are other matters. Something,\r\ntoo, about Celeste, and something about Madame G., whom you are\r\npleased to term the rich widow. This, I think, will keep you quiet a\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nYour letter, written on your return from seeing Natalie, is received.\r\nYou are a dear good little girl to write me so; and of dear little\r\n_gampy_, too, so much, yet never enough. God bless thee.\r\n\r\nA. BURR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nClifton, December 10, 1803.\r\n\r\nBehold me again at Clifton; and, in good truth, I begin to be cloyed\r\nwith the delights of bustle. William and myself left this the day\r\nafter the date of my last. Some difficulty in crossing the horses\r\ndelayed us till then. We reached Charleston on the second day, and I\r\nfound Natalie delighted to see me, and still pretty. She has grown\r\nthinner, much thinner; but her complexion is still good, though more\r\nlanguid. The loss of her hair is, however, an alteration much for the\r\nworse. Her crop is pretty, but not half so much so as her fine brown\r\nhair. I write you all these foolish little particulars because you\r\nenter into them all, or, rather, are sensible of all their importance\r\nto us. Natalie has a lovely little daughter called after her.\r\n\r\nMr. Sumter is very affectionate and attentive to her, and polite to\r\nme. I like him infinitely better than I did. He is an amiable,\r\ngood-hearted man, with talents to render him respectable. The people\r\nof Charleston have paid Natalie every possible attention; indeed, much\r\nmore than I ever received.\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 22d of November greeted me on my arrival here. The\r\nexchange has employed my thoughts ever since. Richmond Hill will, for\r\na few years to come, be more valuable than Morris's; and to you, who\r\nare so fond of town, a place so far from it would be useless. So much\r\nfor my reasoning on one side; now for the other. Richmond Hill has\r\nlost many of its beauties, and is daily losing more. If you mean it\r\nfor a residence, what avail its intrinsic value? If you sell part, you\r\ndeprive it of every beauty save the mere view. Morris's is the most\r\ncommanding view on the island. It is reputed to be indescribably\r\nbeautiful. The grounds are pretty. How many delightful walks can be\r\nmade on one hundred and thirty acres! How much of your taste\r\ndisplayed! In ten or twenty years hence, one hundred and thirty acres\r\non New-York island will be a principality; and there is to me\r\nsomething stylish, elegant, respectable, and suitable to you in having\r\na handsome country-seat. So that, upon the whole, I vote for Morris's.\r\n\r\nYou, perhaps, have not yet heard of the death of J. M'Pherson. He\r\nexpired on the road from town to his brother's. Poor Sally was with\r\nhim, and John here. He has gone for her, and thus Hagley will be\r\ndeserted for a long time.\r\n\r\nMen are indubitably born monkeys. _Gampy_ imitates me in every thing I\r\ndo, and to-day I had a lesson not to be forgotten. He was playing in\r\nmy room while I was dressing; quite at the commencement of my toilet,\r\n_toute a fais en desabille_, I ran out in the entry to call my maid;\r\nwhile engaged in that operation, I turned round and saw my brother's\r\ndoor opening within a few yards of me; girl-like, or rather babylike,\r\nI ran to my room, threw the door open violently, and uttering a\r\nscream, was at the other end of it in one jump. The boy, who was\r\nbusily engaged in eating mint-drops, no sooner heard me scream and\r\nappear frightened than he yelled most loudly, and, running to me,\r\ncaught my clothes, clinched his fists, and appeared really alarmed for\r\ntwo minutes. It was not affectation. Do you think this trait ominous\r\nof a coward? You know my abhorrence and contempt of those animals.\r\nReally I have been uneasy ever since it happened. You see I follow\r\nyour injunction to the letter. How do you like this essay? Have you\r\nenough of _gampy_ now?\r\n\r\nTHEODOSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES BIDDLE.\r\n\r\nNew-York, July 20, 1800.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nThe President has hauled out into the stream. Your boys left my house\r\nyesterday and went on board. They have gained very much of my esteem\r\nand attachment by their amiable manners, their modesty, and good\r\nsense; the friendship which I formerly bore them on your account is\r\nnow due to them on their own.\r\n\r\nThe more I reflect on the destination of these young men, the more I\r\nam pleased with it; and if I had but one son, I think I should place\r\nhim in the navy.\r\n\r\nIf the object be ambition, our navy presents the best prospect of\r\nhonour and advancement. A young man of merit may be sure of rapid\r\npromotion and opportunities of distinction. If the pursuit be wealth,\r\nstill the navy offers the fairest and most honourable means of\r\nacquiring it.\r\n\r\nBut another reason, perhaps not often attended to nor generally\r\nbelieved, would weigh very much with me. The young men of our day,\r\nthose, I mean, who are deemed to be in the higher ranks of life, are\r\naddicted to gross and vicious habits, which are often ruinous to their\r\nhealth and constitutions, and always corrupt the morals and enfeeble\r\nthe mind. In naval life they are certainly much less exposed to these\r\nvices. The profession calls for the active exertions both of body and\r\nmind; and I have always remarked that sailors, I mean those among them\r\nwho are men of education, and are stimulated by motives of honour or\r\nambition, have a generosity of temper, a frankness and manliness of\r\ncharacter, which is much more seldom seen in other orders of life.\r\n\r\nI am, therefore, firmly persuaded that, situated as our country now\r\nis, a young man of activity and talents has the best chance for\r\nhealth, fortune, and honour by entering the navy. Your sons are under\r\npeculiar advantages, for you may be assured that they will find not\r\nonly a friend, but truly a parent in Captain Truxton. We have talked\r\nmuch about them, and I am happy to find that his dispositions towards\r\nthem are such as you could wish.\r\n\r\nI am, dear sir,\r\n\r\nYour very affectionate friend and servant,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\nRecollect, if you please, the Trenton bridge, and find me a copy of\r\nthe law--any information with regard to the difficulties--the expense,\r\nand probable income--also the doings of the commissioners, if indeed\r\nthey have done any thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM JAMES BIDDLE.\r\n\r\nTripoli Prison, November 29, 1803.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI sit down to fulfil the promise made at parting, of writing you upon\r\nour arrival in the Mediterranean. I had flattered myself with the\r\npleasure of hearing from you frequently during the long and happy\r\ncruise which I had contemplated; for, although the greater part of our\r\ntime was to be spent far up the Mediterranean, where opportunities to\r\nAmerica rarely occur, yet I should have written you from every port we\r\nvisited, sealed, and forwarded my letters as a conveyance offered. But\r\nfate, it seems, had cruelly ordained that we should not realize those\r\nprospects of pleasure and gratification which we had, with so much\r\ncertainty, calculated upon; and that this cruise, which had promised\r\nto be so agreeable, should be suddenly terminated, in its very\r\ncommencement, by events the most distressing to ourselves and our\r\nfriends, and which may involve our country in difficulties and\r\nperplexities with this regency.\r\n\r\nFor the unfortunate events of the thirty-first ultimo, the lamentable\r\nday which terminated in the loss of our ship [2] by being wrecked on\r\nrocks within a few miles of this town, and in ourselves becoming\r\nprisoners of war to the Bashaw of Tripoli (I should have said slaves,\r\nfor we certainly are in the most abject slavery, our very lives being\r\nwithin the power and at the very nod of a most capricious tyrant), let\r\nme refer you to statements which I presume you will already have seen\r\nbefore the receipt of this. Suffice it to say, that the shoal we run\r\nupon was never laid down on any chart yet published, nor ever before\r\ndiscovered by any of our vessels cruising off this coast;\r\nconsequently, the charts and soundings justifying as near an approach\r\nto the land as we made, not the smallest degree of censure can be\r\nattached to Captain Bainbridge for the loss of the ship. That, after\r\nhaving grounded, every effort was made, and every expedient tried,\r\nwithout effect, that could have the remotest probability of getting\r\nher afloat; and that, after having sustained the fire of the enemy's\r\ngunboats for upward of four hours, and a re-enforcement approaching\r\nfrom the town, while our guns were rendered almost useless from the\r\ncareening of the ship, there seemed no alternative left but the cruel,\r\nmortifying one of hauling down our colours. Let me also tell you that\r\nthe treatment we received from these savages was such as raised our\r\nutmost indignation. Our swords were snatched from us; the money, and\r\nevery thing in our pockets was stolen; some had their boots pulled off\r\nto examine if something was not concealed there; and some had their\r\nvery coats stripped off their backs, which the barbarians exultingly\r\nput upon themselves; and, as if the trophies of some signal victory,\r\nseemed to triumph in obtaining what fortune alone had put them in\r\npossession of. To murmur at their treatment was only to expose\r\nourselves to repeated and more provoking insults; to resist was only\r\nhazarding our lives. We were therefore obliged, however degrading in\r\nour own opinion, to submit to these lawless, unfeeling robbers.\r\n\r\nWe were all conducted, amid the shouts and acclamations of the rabble\r\nmultitude, to the palace, and there ushered into the presence of the\r\nmighty bashaw, who, seated in state, with his council about him, and\r\nsurrounded by guards, awaited our coming. He asked a variety of\r\nquestions, principally concerning our ship and our squadron; and,\r\nafter having us all paraded before him, and taken a full survey of\r\neach of us, at which a gracious smile appeared upon his countenance,\r\nexpressive of his inward satisfaction at so unexpected a piece of good\r\nfortune, we were carried by our guards to the house allotted for us\r\nduring our imprisonment in this country. It was the American consular\r\nhouse formerly occupied by Mr. Catchcart.\r\n\r\nHere we were left undisturbed to our own reflections till the\r\nfifteenth instant. A few days previous to this the prime minister had\r\nwritten to inform Captain Bainbridge that a letter had been received\r\nfrom the Tripolitan captain of the ship captured by the U. S. Frigate\r\nJohn Adams, in which he complained of being ill treated by Captain\r\nRogers; that, in consequence of this, he should be under the necessity\r\nof retaliating such ill treatment upon us, unless Captain B. would\r\nimmediately write to Commodore Preble, and _order_ him to deliver up\r\nall the prisoners he had, in which latter case we should continue to\r\nbe treated as heretofore. No exchange was proposed, but we were to\r\ndeliver up seventy-eight prisoners merely to ensure our not being\r\ncruelly treated. Captain B. told him that he would write to Commodore\r\nPreble, and acquaint him with their demands; but as to ordering or\r\nrequesting him to deliver up the prisoners in question, he would not\r\ndo it. We were, therefore, conducted to the castle, under the idea of\r\nbeing put to work. The change, indeed, was an unpleasant one, from a\r\nlarge, commodious house, to what they called a castle, which was, in\r\nfact, a most loathsome prison. We were crammed into the same room with\r\nall our ship's company--how well calculated to contain such a number,\r\nyou may be enabled to judge, when I tell you that the place was about\r\neighty feet by twenty-five. How comfortable, when I tell you that the\r\nonly place to admit the air was through a small aperture in the top of\r\nthe house, grated over, with no floor, nor a single article of\r\nfurniture, so that, when we were tired standing up, we were obliged to\r\nlay down on the ground. While there, Lisle, the admiral,\r\n_accidentally_ passed, and was very much _surprised_ at our removal.\r\nHe came to inquire the cause, observing that he had understood a\r\nletter was received, mentioning that the Tripolitan prisoners had been\r\nilly treated by Captain Rogers. Captain Bainbridge told him, that if\r\nsuch a letter had been written, the writer had asserted a most\r\nmalicious falsehood; that the laws of the United States absolutely\r\nforbid any prisoners being illy treated; and that having grounded,\r\nevery effort was made, and every expedient tried, without effect, that\r\ncould have the remotest probability of getting her afloat; and that,\r\nafter having sustained the fire of the enemy's gunboats for upward of\r\nfour hours, and a re-enforcement approaching from the town, while our\r\nguns were rendered almost useless from the careening of the ship,\r\nthere seemed no alternative left but the cruel, mortifying one of\r\nhauling down our colours. Let me also tell you that the treatment we\r\nreceived from these savages was such as raised our utmost indignation.\r\nOur swords were snatched from us; the money, and every thing in our\r\npockets was stolen; some had their boots pulled off to examine if\r\nsomething was not concealed there; and some had their very coats\r\nstripped off their backs, which the barbarians exultingly put upon\r\nthemselves; and, as if the trophies of some signal victory, seemed to\r\ntriumph in obtaining what fortune alone had put them in possession of.\r\nTo murmur at their treatment was only to expose ourselves to repeated\r\nand more provoking insults; to resist was only hazarding our lives. We\r\nwere therefore obliged, however degrading in our own opinion, to\r\nsubmit to these lawless, unfeeling robbers.\r\n\r\nWe were all conducted, amid the shouts and acclamations of the rabble\r\nmultitude, to the palace, and there ushered into the presence of the\r\nmighty bashaw, who, seated in state, with his council about him, and\r\nsurrounded by guards, awaited our coming. He asked a variety of\r\nquestions, principally concerning our ship and our squadron; and,\r\nafter having us all paraded before him, and taken a full survey of\r\neach of us, at which a gracious smile appeared upon his countenance,\r\nexpressive of his inward satisfaction at so unexpected a piece of good\r\nfortune, we were carried by our guards to the house allotted for us\r\nduring our imprisonment in this country. It was the American consular\r\nhouse formerly occupied by Mr. Catchcart.\r\n\r\nHere we were left undisturbed to our own reflections till the\r\nfifteenth instant.

Captain Bainbridge told him, that if\r\nsuch a letter had been written, the writer had asserted a most\r\nmalicious falsehood; that the laws of the United States absolutely\r\nforbid any prisoners being illy treated; and that he knew Captain\r\nRogers had given no just cause of complaint; that, even supposing he\r\nhad, that could not justify their retaliating upon us; it would not\r\ntend to produce a reconciliation, but would have a quite opposite\r\neffect; that, however, we were in their power, and they might\r\nsacrifice the whole of us; but the United States had men and ships\r\nenough to send in our places.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we were reconducted to our former house, probably in\r\nconsequence of the interposition of the Danish and French consuls in\r\nour behalf. The reason of our removal to the castle, as given out to\r\nus, was in order to retaliate upon us ill treatment which they say\r\ntheir prisoners received from us. A more probable reason was this:--\r\n\r\nWhen our ship was plundered, all our chests and trunks, with every\r\narticle of clothing, was carried off. The prime minister, with the\r\nview of making money, bought in at reduced prices as many of our\r\nclothes as he could collect, and offered them to us for twelve hundred\r\ndollars. Captain Bainbridge would not purchase them. Disappointed in\r\nhis expectations of pecuniary profit, and, instead of gain, sustaining\r\nloss, he probably sought consolation in his disappointment by\r\nincreasing the weight of our misfortunes. The prime minister and\r\nadmiral are both renegadoes, the former a Prussian, the latter a\r\nFrenchman.\r\n\r\nHow long we are to remain in this savage country God only knows. No\r\ndoubt it must depend in a great measure upon the exertions that are\r\nmade in our favour. We rely with implicit confidence that the\r\ngovernment of our country will make the most speedy, as well as\r\neffectual measures for our release. While we are here, our lives must\r\nbe in constant jeopardy and uncertainty. Adieu. Remember me\r\naffectionately to Mrs. Alston; and believe me,\r\n\r\nWith much esteem and respect,\r\n\r\nYour most obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJAMES BIDDLE.[3]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n1.

MADISON.\r\n\r\nDepartment of State, December 11, 1803.\r\n\r\nJ. Madison presents his respects to the vice-president, who will find\r\nin the enclosed the information afforded by the office of state on the\r\nsubject of former amendments to the Constitution. Mr. Beckley\r\nrecollects, that in one of the instances, copies equal to the number\r\nof the states were made out in the clerk's office of the House of\r\nRepresentatives. In the other, I understood from him that the copies\r\nwere not furnished to the executive; but it does not appear, from any\r\nthing in the office of state, whether this was or was not the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. WAGNER TO MR. MADISON.\r\n\r\nDepartment of State, December 10, 1803.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI find that all the amendments to the Constitution, though none of\r\nthem are signed by the president, have been enrolled in this office. I\r\ndo not find that the first set was forwarded by this department to the\r\nstates, though the president was requested to communicate them, as\r\nappears by the journals. The last amendment was forwarded by the\r\nsecretary of state, by direction of the president, to the governors of\r\nthe states.\r\n\r\nThe vice-president called this morning and stated two questions, which\r\nI was then unable to answer, _viz_., Whether the enrolment took place\r\nhere, and whether the amendments were forwarded to the states from\r\nhence?\r\n\r\nIt is to enable you to give him satisfaction on these points that I\r\nhave written this. With great respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJ. WAGNER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM SAMUEL A. OTIS.\r\n\r\nSenate Chamber, December 15, 1803.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nIn answer to the note you did me the honour to send this morning, my\r\nfirst impression was that the amendments for each state should be\r\nenrolled in the office of the secretary of the Senate, as the\r\nresolution commenced in Senate. This impression arose from the\r\nproceeding in the _first_ instance, when the enrolments were made in\r\nthe House of Representatives, where the amendments, commenced. This\r\nwas at a time when the secretary of Senate and clerk of the House of\r\nRepresentatives were empowered to publish the laws. But, since the\r\nestablishment Of the department of state, the amendments to the\r\nConstitution have been enrolled in the office of that house where they\r\noriginated. This enrolment, as a bill, hath been sent to the President\r\nof the United States, with a joint resolution that he would forward\r\nauthenticated copies. This was the case in March, 1794, as you will\r\nsee by the journals of Senate. To confirm this idea, a resolution is\r\non the table of the House of Representatives for the above purpose. If\r\nprecedent is of avail, it certainly devolves, in the distribution, on\r\nthe office of state.\r\n\r\nHearing there was some uncertainty, I have, through a friend,\r\ntransmitted my opinion to the secretary of state.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully,\r\n\r\nSAMUEL A. OTIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM GEORGE DAVIS. [1]\r\n\r\nLeghorn, December 3, 1803.\r\n\r\nA letter to my brother [1] of this date will give you a detail of my\r\npursuits since leaving Malaga until my arrival in Leghorn. I have only\r\nto say of Tuscany that two months have passed away in endeavouring to\r\nrepair the ravages of Italian physicians. My pursuits, though not\r\nprofitable, have still been flattering to myself. I am at the house of\r\nF. C. Degen, who married Miss Russell, of Boston. She is acquainted\r\nwith you, and often retraces the hours you spent with Mrs. Russell. I\r\nmay add, that I have been not only a welcome, but most happy guest of\r\nthis worthy family for six weeks. My hours of relaxation have not been\r\nemployed in playing the _cavallero cervante_, but in acquiring the\r\nItalian; and, with the assistance of a tolerable tutor, I am making\r\ngreat progress. Pisa and Lucca I have been at twice, and about the\r\n20th of this month I shall visit Florence. From thence I proceed to\r\nRome, Naples, Palermo, and Malta, where I am directed to join the\r\ncommodore, he having given me furlough for the purposed route.\r\n\r\nI refrain speaking of those places _all the world_ have seen. Should\r\nmy expectations be realized when at Rome, I shall certainly offer you\r\nmy first _essay_. Nothing has yet been done in the way of making me\r\nrich. The hospital establishment lays over till spring. Commodore\r\nMorris offers to leave me as chargé des affaires for Tripoli in the\r\nevent of peace. If nothing better can be done, I will remain. Eaton\r\nhas resigned the consulship of Tunis. Who will be appointed? Rufus\r\nKing is expected daily in Tuscany. He sails early in the spring for\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nI ought not to omit mentioning Mrs. Derby, who arrived here a few days\r\nsince from Florence. I have spent some pleasant hours with her. She is\r\nunaffected and untinctured with the licentious manners of Paris and\r\nLondon. We shall meet at Rome. I yesterday dined with Mr. Pinckney,\r\nour minister for the court of Spain. He wants, I think, _ministerial\r\ndignity_, whatever may be his talents.\r\n\r\nI have written you several times, and although this gives me no claim\r\nto expect a letter, yet, when you learn that I have not received a\r\nline from the United States since leaving it, you may judge how great\r\nis my desire, and what would be my gratification in hearing from you.\r\nThe beautiful Mrs. D. is in the parlour, and I have been sent for\r\nthree times. With perfect respect,\r\n\r\nGEORGE DAVIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM CHARLES BIDDLE.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, December 12, 1803.\r\n\r\nIf you can, without inconvenience, let me know how James stands as a\r\nmidshipman, I wish you would do it. Having lost a brother, a son, and\r\ntwo nephews in the service, I have some right to expect James will not\r\nbe neglected. I have not the honour of knowing the secretary of the\r\nnavy, but I am told he is a very worthy and respectable gentleman.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\nCHARLES BIDDLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM ROBERT SMITH, SECRETARY OF NAVY.\r\n\r\nWashington, December 31, 1803.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nIt was my intention to have had the pleasure of calling upon you for\r\nthe purpose of having some conversation with you about Mr. Biddle,\r\nmidshipman. Not knowing what is the precise object of his father's\r\ninquiries, my communication may not afford the expected explanations.\r\nI can only state to you, at present, that the official reports which\r\nhave been made of him by his commanding officers are highly\r\nfavourable, and that, of course, I have a strong disposition to afford\r\nto him every opportunity of improvement, and to give him every\r\nadvancement in the navy that can be done consistently with the just\r\npretensions of his fellow-officers.\r\n\r\nWe regret sincerely that the weather has deprived us of the pleasure\r\nof presenting, in person, our reciprocal compliments and solicitations\r\nof the season.\r\n\r\nRespectfully yours,\r\n\r\nR. SMITH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM ROBERT G. HARPER.\r\n\r\nBaltimore, December 20, 1803.\r\n\r\nMr. Carroll, my dear sir, requests me to assure you that it will give\r\nhim very particular pleasure to see you at his house on Christmas day,\r\nand as many days before and after as you may find it agreeable to\r\nfavour him with your company. He regrets that there will not, at that\r\ntime, be a room which he can offer you; but, in every thing except the\r\narticle of lodging, he hopes that you will be his guest while you find\r\nit agreeable to remain at Annapolis.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nROBERT G. HARPER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM J. GUILLEMARD.\r\n\r\nFebruary 22, 1803.\r\n\r\nSIR, You will not, I hope, think me over intrusive when I take the\r\nliberty of introducing to your attentions and kindness the Earl of\r\nSelkirk, a young nobleman who has a project of making a settlement for\r\nsome of his countrymen on the western side of the Atlantic. I need say\r\nnothing more of him. His merits will speak for themselves; and give me\r\nleave to add, that I am happy in this opportunity of expressing my\r\ngrateful sense of your kindness and attention to me during my\r\nresidence in the United States. With great respect, your obedient\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nJ. GUILLEMARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM JOHN VAUGHAN.\r\n\r\nWilmington (Delaware), January 3, 1804.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI cannot resist, until morning, the pleasure of acknowledging how much\r\nI am indebted to you for an acquaintance with Doctor Peter Irving and\r\nMr. Bishop. I found them all you intimated, and much more; and\r\nsincerely hope the reciprocation you anticipated may have taken place.\r\nWe spent the evening with Mr. Dickinson, and, I believe, with mutual\r\npleasure; and they have just left my house, Dr. Irving the last. We\r\nhave many fine tales of the satisfaction inspired by a common sense of\r\n_public rights_, but I query whether a just sense of _political\r\nwrongs_ do not bind men more closely together.\r\n\r\nA very curious game, indeed, has been played here since you passed\r\nthrough our borough. A special caucus has been held, to counteract the\r\npolitical machinations which are to arise out of my pleasurable\r\ninterview with you; but the clamour is unexpectedly checked. Some\r\nwicked man in New-York had the assurance to send to Mr. Dickinson and\r\nmyself each a copy of a pamphlet, entitled, \"_An Examination, &c., by\r\nAristides_,\" and, after perusing it with equal pleasure and avidity, I\r\nhad the imprudence to hand it to a disinterested republican, who read\r\nit with the highest satisfaction. In one week it has passed through\r\nseveral hands, and has excited no inconsiderable interest. Dr. Irving\r\nhas promised me a supply as soon as practicable.\r\n\r\nI am authorized to say that Mr. Dickinson was never prejudiced, and is\r\nnow highly gratified. He indeed regretted that I had not assured you,\r\nwhen here, that his opinion was untarnished by the malignant clamour\r\nof demagogues.\r\n\r\nIt is a more than lamentable fact, that factions have arisen up in\r\nseveral states which are determined to prostrate every man who might\r\nbe capable of opposing them, or dared to lisp one expression of\r\ndissent to the machinations of favouritism. But, though I have borne\r\ntoo much, I am unalterably resolved to adhere inflexibly to the ground\r\nI have taken, and stand or fall in the honest path of political\r\nrectitude.\r\n\r\nThere is a crisis in the affairs of men which sooner or later unveils\r\nthe hidden features of selfishness; and there is no position in which\r\nmy opinion is more fixed than in the utility of a firm union of honest\r\nmen. If the cabals of the day be not speedily arrested, where shall\r\nour political bark be anchored? The Sylla of oligarchy, or Charybdis\r\nof disorganization must be the portion of our government. Of all\r\ntyrannies, oligarchies are the most delusive and dreadful, and anarchy\r\nis equally to be deplored.\r\n\r\nWishing you, my dear sir, complete retribution for the past, and happy\r\nin the reflection of having preserved myself uncontrolled by artifice,\r\n\r\nI am sincerely your friend,\r\n\r\nJOHN VAUGHAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM JOHN DICKINSON.\r\n\r\nWilmington, Delaware, 4th 1st mo, 1804.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND,\r\n\r\nThy letter of the 30th of last month was delivered to me yesterday by\r\nAbraham Bishop, and I desire thee to accept my thanks for introducing\r\none to the other.\r\n\r\nHe was so kind as to spend some hours with me, and I was exceedingly\r\npleased with the traits of character displayed in the course of our\r\nconversation. He appears to me to be a man who possesses great and\r\nwell-directed energies of mind. I rejoice in the prospect he opened to\r\nme of the advancement of republican principles and measures to the\r\neastward.\r\n\r\nI am thy sincere friend,\r\n\r\nJOHN DICKINSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES BIDDLE.\r\n\r\nWashington, January 2, 1804.\r\n\r\nLast evening I received the answer of Robert Smith, of which a copy is\r\nenclosed. It may be satisfactory to you to know, _officially_, that\r\nJames is favourably spoken of, and is in estimation with the\r\ngovernment. A more precise answer could not, perhaps, be expected from\r\na minister. The application may secure him from being forgotten, and\r\nthe answer from being prejudiced in any future arrangements. He shall\r\nbe informed of your precise object by\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nWashington, January 3, 1804.\r\n\r\nThis is only to assure you that I am in perfect health. That General\r\nJackson is my good friend; that I have had no duel nor quarrel with\r\nanybody, and have not been wounded or hurt.\r\n\r\nJerome Bonaparte, wife, maids of honour (Miss Spear _et al_.), &c.,\r\n&c., will be here to-morrow. There are various opinions about the\r\nexpediency, policy, decency, propriety, and future prospects of this\r\nmatch. I adhere to Mrs. Caton. To be sure the French laws say\r\nsomething on this subject. As you are a learned lady, I will not say\r\nwhat; but, if you avow ignorance, you shall have all I know: not in my\r\nnext, for Annapolis is yet on hand. Indeed, matters thicken so fast,\r\nthat I may possibly leave this within twenty days to go northward,\r\nwithout saying a word about it. I hope the shawl (or cloak) has\r\narrived safe, and that it may be so displayed as to add beauty to\r\ngrace and grace to beauty.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nWashington, January 4th or 5th, 1804.\r\n\r\nHow could I forget to tell you the very important event of the\r\nmarriage of Jerome Bonaparte with Miss Patterson.\r\n\r\nIt took place on Saturday, the 24th ult. Mrs. Caton approves of this\r\nmatch, and therefore A. B. does, for he respects greatly the opinions\r\nof Mrs. Caton.\r\n\r\nI like much your reasoning about Morris's place and Richmond Hill. Yet\r\nwould not a permanent residence in town for some, for many, for all\r\nreasons, be better? La G. is much better than I had heard--_d'un\r\ncertaine_ age, and well-looking, considering that circumstance.\r\nCheerful, good-tempered, the best of housewives, and, as it is\r\nthought, _willing_.\r\n\r\nCeleste--(for this I begin a new line) Celeste will be seen on the way\r\nhome, but that La R. spoils every thing in that place. La Planche;\r\nthat you will never find out. I bet you thirty guineas against M'K.'s\r\nshawl. By-the-by, the shawl is ordered on; at this moment, perhaps, on\r\nthe perilous ocean, and unensured. La Planche, I say, was seen on our\r\nway hither. All right and pretty; improved since the last inspection.\r\nGreat friend of La R.; _tant pis_. Lex et ux. ill suited; mischief\r\nbrewing. _Gamp_, the mutual friend and confidant.\r\n\r\nNow for the trip to Annapolis. No, not now either. It is past two\r\no'clock in the morning (no matter of what day, for I don't intend to\r\ndate this, seeing it will equally suit all dates), and I am (not)\r\nsleepy. Yet I will go to bed, and not be kept up by any such baggage.\r\nSo good-morning. Poor little Natalie, I have not written her a line.\r\nWhat's the matter I don't write to Natalie any more? I say I will go\r\nto bed. The fire is out, and I have no wood.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PEGGY GAITIN (A SLAVE).\r\n\r\nWashington, January 4, 1804.\r\n\r\nYou may assure the family that I never was in better health; that I\r\nhave not been wounded or hurt, and have had no quarrel with anybody. I\r\nreceived your letter of the 29th this evening. Let nothing hinder you\r\nfrom going to school punctually. Make the master teach you arithmetic,\r\nso that you may be able to keep the accounts of the family. I am very\r\nmuch obliged to you for teaching Nancy. She will learn more from you\r\nthan by going to school.\r\n\r\nI shall be at home about the last of this month, when I will make you\r\nall New Year's presents. Tell Harry that I shall expect to find a good\r\nroad up to the house. Tell me what Harry is about, and what is doing\r\nat Montalto. Sam and George are well.\r\n\r\nYou must write to Mrs. Alston about Leonora's child. Enclose your\r\nletter to me. I hope little Peter is doing well.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nWashington, January 17, 1804.\r\n\r\nYour kind wishes on the new year are received this evening in your\r\nletter dated 3d January, 1803. No matter what date, such things are\r\nalways welcome. I don't believe it came into my head to say Happy New\r\nYear! my heart is so full of good wishes for you every day in the\r\ncalendar. Yet I like to see attention paid to all _les jours de fête_.\r\nI am very sorry for poor Charlotte, and do most sincerely sympathize\r\nwith Sally. She must know my great attachment for her brother.\r\n\r\nOf my plans for the spring nothing can be said, for nothing is\r\nresolved. It is not probable that I shall be able to visit you; but I\r\nshall expect you very early. If you are to come by land, I will meet\r\nyou on the road; perhaps in this place, perhaps in Richmond. I do not\r\nnow see that it will be possible for me to visit South Carolina. Now,\r\nwhat are your plans? The shawl was ordered on the very day I received\r\nyour commands; whether it has actually been sent I know not, but most\r\nprobably it has.\r\n\r\nOf the boy you never say enough. Nothing about his French in your\r\nlast. I hope you talk to him much in French, and Eleonore always. A\r\nletter from Peggy says that Eleonore's boy was well on the 13th. Your\r\nicehouse and vaults are finished. Of Annapolis I find the newspapers\r\nhave anticipated me. They will tell you where I dined, and supped, and\r\nwhom I saw.\r\n\r\nMadame Bonaparte passed a week here. She is a charming little woman;\r\njust the size and nearly the figure of Theodosia Burr Alston; by some\r\nthought a little like her; perhaps not so well in the shoulders;\r\ndresses with taste and simplicity (by some thought too free); has\r\nsense, and spirit, and sprightliness. A little of the style and manner\r\nof Susan Smith.\r\n\r\nMrs. Merry [2] is tall, fair, fat--_pas trop_, however. No more than a\r\ndesirable embonpoint. Much of grace and dignity, ease and\r\nsprightliness; full of intelligence. An Englishwoman who has lived\r\nmuch in Paris, and has all that could be wished of the manners of both\r\ncountries. An amiable and interesting companion, with whose\r\nacquaintance you will, next summer, be much gratified. She proposes to\r\npass some time in New-York.\r\n\r\nI want a French translation of the Constitution of the United States,\r\nand, for the purpose, send you a copy in English. It will, I fear, be\r\na great labour to you; but I cannot get it done here, and it may not\r\nbe useless to you to burnish up your French a little. Do you ever hear\r\nfrom Natalie? I have not yet written to her. How scandalous.\r\n\r\nYou do not say whether the boy knows his letters. I am sure he may now\r\nbe taught them, and then put a pen into his hand, and set him to\r\nimitate them. He may read and write before he is three years old.\r\nThis, with speaking French, would make him a tolerably accomplished\r\nlad of that age, and worthy of his blood.\r\n\r\nA most bitter cold day. _Bon jour_.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH ALSTON.\r\n\r\nWashington, January 18, 1804.\r\n\r\nI have been greatly flattered by the applauses bestowed on your speech\r\nat Columbia. Send me half a dozen copies. Why have you not already\r\ndone it?\r\n\r\nThe papers herewith enclosed will show you our possession of\r\nLouisiana, and the manner of it. The Spanish government will endeavour\r\nto limit our west bounds to the Mississippi, with the addition of the\r\nIsland of Orleans only; on this consideration that government would\r\nstill hold on the west bank of the Mississippi, from the river\r\nIberville to the 31st degree of latitude, an extent of one hundred\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to legislate for our newly-acquired territory, it is\r\ndoubted whether the Louisianians can be received into the Union\r\nwithout an amendment to the Constitution. Consider of this. Again, are\r\nthey citizens of the United States, or can Congress make them such? A\r\nbill establishing a form of government is now before the Senate; when\r\nit shall have passed that house I will send you a copy. It is at\r\npresent in too crude a state to merit your notice.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers will have informed you that a committee has been\r\nappointed in the House of Representatives to inquire into the official\r\nconduct of Judge Chace. Peters is associated with him, but he is not\r\nthe object, and the insertion of his name was accidental. This\r\ninquiry, as is obvious, is with a view to an impeachment. If it result\r\nin an impeachment, and an immediate trial be had, Congress will sit\r\ntill May or June. Yours very affectionately,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES BIDDLE.\r\n\r\nWashington, January 20, 1804.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI thank you for the letter and the newspaper; for a short letter too,\r\nwritten on your return from Lancaster, which has not yet been\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\nIt is seriously my intention to visit you next week, if I can get\r\naway, which will depend a little on the state of business in Senate.\r\nThe association of Peters with Chace was, I believe, accidental. It\r\nwas moved (I think by one of your members), and, as they sat together\r\non the bench, it was not, at the time, seen how they could be\r\nseparated. I presume it affords him a new subject for wit. On receipt\r\nof this, write me one line, saying when Mr. R. will leave\r\nPhiladelphia. God bless you.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES BIDDLE.\r\n\r\nWashington, January 23, 1804.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nWhen I last wrote you (about Thursday, I think), I felt the approaches\r\nof a headache, which I concluded would be, as usual, the torment of\r\ntwenty-four hours only. On the contrary, it has pursued me without\r\nintermission. I have undergone cathartic, emetic, and phlebotomy,\r\noperations not experienced by me in twenty years, and all to no\r\npurpose. The pain continues, but to-day has allowed me to leave my bed\r\nfor an hour or so at a time. At one of these intervals I now write to\r\nyou to say that this incident has rendered my journey doubtful, though\r\non the day I last wrote you I informed the Senate that I should have\r\noccasion to be absent for two or three weeks.\r\n\r\nIt is extraordinary that all these medical experiments, and a total\r\nabstinence from food for three days, has produced no diminution of\r\nstrength or spirits. At this instant I feel able to start for\r\nPhiladelphia (the snow eight inches deep) not withstanding. It will,\r\nhowever, be impossible to move before Thursday, if at all.\r\n\r\nJanuary 24.\r\n\r\nAfter writing, last evening, the nonsense on the other page, I\r\nrecollected that the mail had closed. This postscript is added to say\r\nthat I am much better to-day; but little pain, yet my head too weak to\r\nbear the least motion, and fear it will not allow me to travel for\r\nseveral days.\r\n\r\nI. Brown is again in the chair as president of the Senate. It was a\r\nhard election. Ten or twelve ballotings. The Virginia interest\r\nsupported Mr. Franklin. Yours,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO NATALIE DELAGE SUMTER.\r\n\r\nWashington, January 25,1804.\r\n\r\nYour safe arrival, my dear Natalie, gave me the greatest joy.\r\nTheodosia has given me a detailed account of yourself and your lovely\r\nlittle girl. All as I could wish. I could never realize that you were\r\nnot lost to me till I heard that you were actually on American ground.\r\nYour letter relieved my anxieties and fulfilled my hopes, by assuring\r\nme of your unabated affection. But when or where, I pray, are we to\r\nmeet? Engage Mr. Sumter to come and pass the summer with me at\r\nNew-York; by the summer I mean from the 1st of May till the middle of\r\nNovember. Theodosia has told you that I am wholly at Richmond Hill,\r\nand that her house is only five miles off. You will review with\r\npleasure the scenes of your sportive childhood, and you will gratify\r\nthe fondest wishes of your affectionate friend and father,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\nP. S. I enclose some papers for the amusement of your husband. Pray\r\npresent them to him with the assurance of my respectful and\r\naffectionate regard. You, too, my dear Natalie, will read with\r\ninstruction and amusement the account of Louisiana.\r\n\r\nA. B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nWashington, January 25, 1804.\r\n\r\nA letter from Mari, without a line from Theodosia, is novel. If the\r\ncompliment should be returned, I should bring an old house about my\r\nears. But no apologies or explanations.\r\n\r\nI hate them, and the matter will be forgotten before they can reach\r\nme.\r\n\r\nI have been a week confined to my room by a headache, but there are no\r\nmortal or alarming symptoms. On Saturday I take a ride to Baltimore,\r\nwhere I am to dine with Madame Bonaparte. Then on to Philadelphia;\r\nthence, perhaps, to New-York, and here again by the time your answer\r\ncan arrive. Have not yet written to Natalie. How shameful!\r\n\r\nFine sleighing here. Eight inches snow; clear and cold. Having nothing\r\nmore at present of great importance to add I remain yours, &c.,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\nP. S. Since the conclusion of this performance I have set down in a\r\nrage, and written a _pretty_ little letter to Natalie. Lord, how much\r\neasier and lighter I feel.\r\n\r\nA. B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO NATALIE DELAGE SUMTER.\r\n\r\nWashington, January 27, 1804.\r\n\r\nThe _brochure_, containing proclamations and manifestoes regarding\r\nLouisiana, was intended to accompany those which I lately transmitted\r\nto you for Mr. Sumter.\r\n\r\nYou will be proud, as a New-Yorker, to see that the first attempt to\r\ncreate a taste for painting and sculpture has been made in our city.\r\nWe have about forty busts and groups. Lailson's theatre (west side\r\nGreenwich-street) has been fitted up for their reception. It forms a\r\ncircular room of about sixty or seventy feet diameter, lighted by a\r\ndome, and to us, who have seen nothing better, the thing, of course,\r\nlooks well. Come and see our infant efforts.\r\n\r\nI am just leaving this place for a few days on a visit to\r\nPhiladelphia; a visit, however, of business only. On my return you\r\nwill hear again from me. In the mean time, pray write me when I may\r\nexpect you at New-York.\r\n\r\nA. BURR,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nWashington, January 29, 1804.\r\n\r\nThere is no end to the trouble such a baggage gives me. Another thing\r\noccurs, which, forsooth, must be sent to her too. It would not,\r\nperhaps, merit so high an honour as that of being perused by\r\nyour----eyes and touched by your fair hands, but that it is the\r\nproduction of a youth [3] of about nineteen, the youngest brother of\r\nDr. Peter Irving, of New-York.\r\n\r\n_Salut_.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO A. R. ELLERY.\r\n\r\nWashington, January 29, 1804.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 6th of January is received at the moment that I am\r\nleaving this city on a tour to Philadelphia for two or three weeks. I\r\ncan, therefore, only acknowledge it. The map was a most acceptable\r\npresent. I value it greatly as the work of Madame Ellery; a\r\ncircumstance which my vanity has not allowed me to conceal.\r\n\r\nYou may rely on my zeal and my good will. You can estimate their\r\nimportance. On my return you will hear again from me.\r\n\r\nThe bill, or project of law, herewith enclosed, is now under debate in\r\nthe Senate. You will, therefore, consider it as a project merely, not\r\nyet a law. In the course of this discussion it may receive important\r\nalterations, and may be finally rejected. Do not, therefore, suffer\r\nany copy to be taken of it, still less to get into newspapers, if any\r\nyou have. You may show it to whom you please. If you have any\r\nacquaintance with Mr. Daniel Clarke, pray let him see it. I wish his\r\nand your opinions, though they may, probably, be received too late to\r\ninfluence the result. Mr. Clarke is not known to me personally, but\r\nvery much through our common friend General Dayton. With respectful\r\ncompliments and thanks to Mrs. Ellery, I am your friend,\r\n\r\nA. Burr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nHavre de Grace (Susquehannah), January 30, 1804. In a former letter I\r\ntold you we had eight inches snow at Washington. On Saturday last,\r\n28th, fell six or eight inches more, so that we had a foot depth of\r\nsnow, cold weather, and, of course, good sleighing. The vice-president\r\nhaving, with great judgment and science, calculated the gradations of\r\ncold in different latitudes, discovered that for every degree he\r\nshould go north he might count on _four and a half inches_ of snow.\r\nThus he was sure of _sixteen and a half_ inches at Philadelphia;\r\n_twenty-one inches_ at New-York, and so for all the intermediate\r\nspace. Hence he wisely concluded to take off the wheels from his\r\ncoachee and to set it on runners. This was no sooner resolved than\r\ndone. With his sleigh and four horses he arrived at Baltimore at early\r\ndinner. Passed the evening with Madame Bonaparte; all very charming.\r\nCame off this morning; fine sleighing. A hundred times he applauded\r\nthe wisdom of his plan. Within _six_ miles of the Susquehannah the\r\nsnow appeared thin; within _four_, the ground was bare. It had not\r\nthawed, but none had fallen. He dragged on to this place, and here he\r\nis in the midst of the most forlorn dilemma. This is palpable fraud in\r\n_monsieur le tems_, to hold out such lures merely to draw one into\r\njeopardy. Having neither wife nor daughter near me on whom to vent my\r\nspleen, renders the case more deplorable. It is downright desperation.\r\n\r\nAfter pacing the floor with a very quick step for about five minutes,\r\nI determined to call for a good dinner and a bottle of wine, and,\r\nafter the discussion whereof, I hope to be more able to meet the\r\nexigence. You shall presently know.\r\n\r\nNew-York, February 8, 1804.\r\n\r\nJust arrived--all well. The dinner and wine mentioned t'other side\r\noperated so happily, that, before the repast was concluded, I ordered\r\nmy horses to the door, drove over the Susquehannah on the ice, and\r\ncame that night to the head of Elk. Next day to Chester, having seen\r\nfriend Dickenson _en passant_ (the daughters not visible, on account\r\nof the loss of their mother, who died _last summer_), and breakfasted\r\nin Philadelphia on the morning of the 1st of February. The ebullition\r\nof the 30th January was intended to have been finished at Havre de\r\nGrace and sent to the postoffice. I came off in too much haste, and,\r\nseeing it now in my writing-case, I thought it a pity that so precious\r\na morceau should be lost to the world.\r\n\r\n_Tout le monde_ is marrying at Philadelphia. You will not have a\r\n_single single_ (decipher that) acquaintance there on your return.\r\nYes, La R., La Planche, and La Bin. may remain. I went to a wedding\r\nsupper at Mrs. Moore's, whose daughter has married Willing--could any\r\none suppose she was _unwilling_? Execrable! Mr. Boadley died a few\r\ndays ago. Madame of course was invisible. Ann Stuart will, most\r\nlikely, marry P. C.--very well. She is very pretty. Mary Rush just\r\nmarried Manners, a captain in the British army. She looked quite\r\nmelancholy, being on the point of setting off for Niagara, where her\r\nhusband is stationed. Binney and Keene look better than I ever saw\r\nthem. Keene is learning the harp. They are at lodgings in town, and,\r\nhappening to be near my quarters, I saw them two or three times a day.\r\n\r\nI left Philadelphia yesterday, and arrived, as you see, after a very\r\npleasant journey. Fine, mild winter weather. Roads hard and smooth.\r\nNote. I left my runners and got wheels at Philadelphia. How could I\r\nomit Celeste and her sisters, whom I saw several times? What of that?\r\nPray can it be true that she was engaged to a young man whom we knew\r\nand valued, and who lately died in your country? To-morrow I am to see\r\nLa G. Pray for me.\r\n\r\nTo-morrow, February 9th.\r\n\r\nA most ugly northeast storm of rain, and hail, and mist. Shall not see\r\nLa G. to-day. God bless thee.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nNew-York, February 16, 1804.\r\n\r\nIn one hour I shall be on the west side of the Hudson river, and in\r\nthe mail stage. Goldsmith is the very book I should have recommended.\r\nA critical knowledge of historical events may assist a statesman or\r\nform a pedant. For you, something less will do, and something more is\r\nnecessary. La G. will not do. I have written twice to Natalie.\r\n\r\nSay to Mari, the Clintons, Livingstons, &c., had not, at the last\r\nadvice from Albany, decided on their candidate for governor. Hamilton\r\nis intriguing for any candidate who can have a chance of success\r\nagainst A. B. He would, doubtless, become the advocate even of Dewitt\r\nClinton if he should be the opponent.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nBaltimore, February 21, 1804. I left New-York on the 16th. The roads\r\nwere so very bad that I sent back Sam, George, and the horses from\r\nTrenton, and came on in the mail stage _sans valet_. One great\r\ndiscovery has been made by the experiment, namely, that George is not\r\nonly useless on the road, but requires abundance of my care, so that,\r\nin fact, I have less trouble without him.\r\n\r\nOn the way I saw Celeste, and renewed, with some levity, a certain\r\nsubject. It excited an agitation perfectly astonishing. The emotion\r\nwas so great as to produce universal tremour, which attracted the\r\nnotice of the company (there was a room full); I was exceedingly\r\nalarmed and perplexed, having imagined the denouement of last summer\r\nto have been conclusive, in good faith. Undoubtedly there is some\r\nsecret agent, some underwork, perhaps restraint, of which I am\r\nignorant. I strongly suspect that she has done violence to her\r\nfeelings. Shall I or shall I not investigate this point? Humph!\r\nheighho!\r\n\r\nI have just been visiting Monsieur Dubourg, president of the French\r\nCollege. The visit, indeed, was to the institution rather than to the\r\nman. Both please me greatly. It (the college) seems to me to possess\r\nsome advantages over any other in the United States; more decorous\r\nsubordination. The living languages, French and Spanish, may there be\r\nlearned by association and habit. The French, the Spanish, the English\r\n(I mean the learners of those languages) are each in separate\r\napartments. Not a word is spoken but in the language intended to be\r\ntaught. It is even the medium of instruction for every other branch.\r\nThe Senats speak Spanish fluently. _Bon soir_.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS SUMTER, JUN.\r\n\r\nWashington, February 27, 1504.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nOn my return from New-York a few days past, I had the pleasure to meet\r\nhere your father, and to receive your letter of the 21st of January.\r\nIt is not probable that it will be in my power to visit South Carolina\r\nthis spring. If, fortunately, I should find leisure for a journey\r\nwhich I have so much at heart, my first object would be Statesburgh;\r\nbut as Mr. and Mrs. Alston will be in New-York early in the season, I\r\nentertain hopes that this, with other motives, may induce you to pass\r\nthe summer and autumn with me. Yet great as is my solicitude to see\r\nyour wife and child, to renew my acquaintance with you, to tender you\r\nmy friendship and affection, and to claim a return, I would by no\r\nmeans urge a measure inconsistent with your interest. Of this you only\r\ncan judge. I should not, perhaps, have repeated the invitation\r\nexpressed in my last letter to Natalie, but that I learn from your\r\nfather that her health has suffered materially. Hence I am filled with\r\napprehension of the effects of your long summer on a northern\r\nconstitution already debilitated.\r\n\r\nPresuming that you hear from your father as much as you desire to know\r\nof the doings of Congress, I abstain from those subjects. Be assured\r\nof the great consideration and esteem with which I am your friend,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES BIDDLE.\r\n\r\nWashington, March 3, 1804.\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 28th February, covering a newspaper, was received\r\nlast evening. It cannot yet be settled whether there will be\r\ncommissioners to run the boundary line with Spain; but I will mention\r\nthe thing to the Smiths, who still profess friendship for General\r\nWilkinson. My direct interference otherwise would not probably be\r\nuseful to him. Please to put the enclosed, for Truxton, in the\r\npostoffice. One of his friends here (not a man in power, for he has, I\r\nbelieve, no such friend) thinks he will certainly be called into\r\nservice; and he states to me pretty plausible grounds for the opinion.\r\nYet I doubt, which is perhaps the result only of my ignorance.\r\n\r\nI shall be with you the last of next week, or, at farthest, within ten\r\ndays, on my way home.\r\n\r\nVery affectionately yours,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO FREDERIC A. VANDERKEMP.\r\n\r\nWashington, March 6, 1804.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nImmediately on the receipt of your letter of the 15th of February, I\r\nwrote to Mr. Madison for the information you desired. It affords me\r\ngreat pleasure to learn that you are engaged in a literary pursuit so\r\ncongenial with your taste and your talents. If I can in any way\r\npromote your views in this or in any other instance, I entreat that\r\nyou will command me, _without apology_. I have now the satisfaction to\r\nenclose you Mr. Madison's answer, which I this day received.\r\n\r\nYou speak of a letter written to me some time ago-on the subject of\r\nCaptain Ingraham's voyage. It is impossible, sir, that I can have been\r\nguilty of so gross an inattention as to have permitted a letter from\r\nyou to have remained unnoticed. I have no recollection of that which\r\nyou mention, and am persuaded that it never came to hand.\r\n\r\nAllow me to repeat the assurance of the very great consideration and\r\nrespect with which I am\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM P. VAN NESS.\r\n\r\nWashington, March 7, 1804.\r\n\r\nFriday last was the day assigned for the appearance of Judge Pickering\r\non his impeachment. He did not appear; but an _amicus curiae_\r\nsuggested that the judge was insane, and tendered the proof of that\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nThis has given rise to some troublesome questions, rendered more\r\nembarrassing by the total want of rule or precedent, and still\r\nincreased by some dissatisfaction on the part of the managers, which\r\nseems to have also infected the House of Representatives. In this\r\ndilemma it would be improper that I should leave the Senate.\r\nConsiderations, however, of a nature which you will more readily\r\napprove, have had an influence in detaining me. A decision is hoped\r\nthis day on the points now under discussion. I take my leave as soon\r\nas this business is disposed of, and will be with you in the course of\r\nmail-stage.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nNew-York, March 28, 1804\r\n\r\nYour letter, dated early in this month--I don't recollect the very\r\nday, having left the letter in town; but you write so seldom that a\r\nreference to the month is sufficiently descriptive; your letter, then,\r\nof March, announcing your removal to the Oaks, the pretty description\r\nof your house and establishment, _and all that_, were very amusing. I\r\nhad really begun to doubt whether you were not all dead or something\r\nworse.\r\n\r\nI shall get the speech, no thanks to you; there is a copy in\r\nPhiladelphia, for which I have written, and it will come endorsed by\r\nthe fair hand of Celeste: truly her hand and arm are handsome. I did\r\nnot see her on my way through--_tant mieux_; for I took great affront;\r\nthence ensued explanations, &c. Nothing like a quarrel to advance\r\nlove. La Planche I did see twice in one day; the last a long, very\r\nlong visit. Lovely in weeds. La G., of whom you inquire, is of the\r\ngrave age of forty-six; about the age of the vice-president.\r\n\r\nThey are very busy here about an election between Morgan Lewis and A.\r\nBurr. The former supported by the Livingstons and Clintons, the latter\r\n_per se_. I would send you some new and amusing libels against the\r\nvice-president, but, as you did not send the speech, nor did even\r\nacknowledge the receipt of one of the many public documents which I\r\ntook the trouble of forwarding, it may be presumed that this sort of\r\nintercourse is not desired.\r\n\r\nPh. Church and Miss Stewart, of Philadelphia, it is said, are to be\r\nmarried; Duer (which Duer I don't know) and Miss M. Denning reported\r\nas engaged; Bunner and Miss Church said to be mutually in love; on his\r\npart avowed, on hers not denied.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Selkirk is here: a frank, unassuming, sensible man of\r\nabout thirty. Whether he thinks of La R. is unknown to the writer. He\r\ndines with me on Monday.\r\n\r\nIf you had one particle of invention or genius, you would have taught\r\nA. B. A. his _a, b, c_ before this. God mend you. His fibbing is an\r\ninheritance, which pride, an inheritance, will cure. His mother went\r\nthrough that process. Adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nNew-York, April 3, 1804.\r\n\r\nI hasten to acknowledge your long, interesting, and beautiful letter\r\nof the 14th. It is received this morning, and finds me in the midst of\r\noccupations connected with the approaching election: of course, every\r\nmoment interruptions.\r\n\r\nThe History of Frederic II. will amuse you. You will read Montesquieu\r\nwith interest and instruction. Yet he has a character--I mean that his\r\n\"_Esprit des Loix_\" has a character above its merit. His historical\r\nfacts are, nevertheless, collected and arranged with judgment, and his\r\nreasoning is ingenuous. The political dogmas are not, however, to be\r\nreceived as axioms. They are neither founded on experience nor on a\r\nknowledge of human nature.\r\n\r\nYou improve greatly in your style and manner of writing. A little more\r\npains and a little more reading, and you will exceed Lady Mary W.\r\nMontague. Practice, however, is indispensable. The art of writing is\r\nan acquirement, as much as music or dancing.\r\n\r\nApril 7.\r\n\r\nSince the 3d I have vainly endeavoured to get a minute to write to\r\nyou. It will not, I fear, be possible before the 30th inst., when, or\r\nsoon after, I hope to be in Philadelphia, whence you will hear from\r\nme. As you have a great taste for mischief, I send you a new paper [4]\r\nestablished in this city, by whom edited unknown. Some of the numbers\r\nare allowed to have wit. Whether these have any I know not. God bless\r\nthee.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. -----\r\n\r\nNew-York, April 18, 1804.\r\n\r\nYour vanity, if in any degree concerned, will be fully satisfied by\r\nthe assurance that my heart, my wishes, and my thoughts will be with\r\nyou. The mortal part of me is indispensably otherwise engaged. As you\r\ncannot fail to have admirers, you cannot fail to be amused. Knowing\r\nthat you are happy, I shall be so by sympathy, though in a less\r\ndegree, as reflected light is less potent than direct.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nNew-York, April 25, 1804.\r\n\r\nWhat nice, pretty paper. I verily believe that it would not have\r\nentered into my head to write to you; but _Peet_ or _Peter_ just\r\nbrought in a ream of paper so handsome looking, that it tempted me to\r\nwrite, and _chose_ being generally uppermost in my mind, of course it\r\nwill be addressed to _chose_, though, for aught that yet appears, it\r\nwill suit as well _quelque autre chose_.\r\n\r\nI, too, write in a storm; an election storm, of the like you have once\r\nbeen a witness. The thing began yesterday, and will terminate\r\nto-morrow. My headquarters are in Johnstreet, and I have, since\r\nbeginning this letter, been already three times interrupted.\r\n\r\nA very modest and amiable proposition! that I should ride sixteen\r\nhundred miles to see a couple of _varmins_. As to your system of\r\neconomy, I should rejoice at it if I believed it; but I well know that\r\nyou will spend double at the Mills that you would here. Now for my\r\nplan, which is to be submitted to the judgment and the _feelings_ of\r\nMr. Alston.\r\n\r\nYou take Richmond Hill; bring no horse nor carriage. I have got a\r\nnice, new, beautiful little chariot, made purposely to please you. I\r\nhave also a new coachee, very light, on an entire new construction,\r\ninvented by the vice-president. Now these two machines are severally\r\nadapted to two horses, and you may take your choice of them. Of horses\r\nI have five; three always and wholly at your devotion, and the whole\r\nfive occasionally. Harry and Sam are both good coachmen, either at\r\nyour orders. Of servants there are enough for family purposes.\r\nEleonore, however, must attend you, for the sake of the heir apparent.\r\nYou will want no others, as there are at my house Peggy, Nancy, and a\r\nsmall girl of about eleven. Mr. Alston may bring a footman. Any thing\r\nfurther will be useless; he may, however, bring six or eight of them,\r\nif he like. The cellars and garrets are well stocked with wine, having\r\nhad a great supply last fall. I shall take rooms (a house, &c.) in\r\ntown, but will live with you as much or as little as you may please\r\nand as we can agree; but my establishment at Richmond Hill must\r\nremain, whether you come or not. Great part of the summer I shall be\r\noff eight or ten days at a time, but no long journeys. You will have\r\nto ride every day or two to Montalto to direct the laying out of the\r\ngrounds, &c.\r\n\r\nIn this way you cannot, without wanton extravagance, expend more than\r\nfour hundred dollars. If you insist on bringing your horses, there is\r\nnow room for them, and plenty of provender. You ought to come by\r\nwater, but not to be swindled again by taking a cabin. Bring your Ada,\r\nif you please, to finish her education.\r\n\r\nTell Mr. Alston that I ordered my booksellers to open a correspondence\r\nwith him, and to send out, by way of sample, and under the advice of\r\nM'Kinnon, not to exceed the value of fifty guineas. M'Kinnon writes me\r\nthat the articles will be here by the first or before the middle of\r\nJune, shipped for New-York.\r\n\r\nI forgot to speak of the election. [5]\r\n\r\nBoth parties claim majorities, and there never was, in my opinion, an\r\nelection, of the result of which so little judgment could be formed.\r\nA. B. will have a small majority in this city _if to-morrow should be\r\na fair day_, and not else.\r\n\r\nYou may wonder how I live and mean to live in town. Peter and Alexis\r\nare all my attendants. My breakfast is made _a la garcon_: dinners,\r\n&c., from a neighbouring eatinghouse. Adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nNew-York, May 1, 1804.\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 16th of April had better luck than that other of\r\nthe 1st.; on the road, I mean, for the reception of both was equally\r\nkind. The last arrived yesterday. I do not remember exactly what it is\r\nabout, and it is on my table in the library up stairs, and I am\r\nwriting in the dining-room beside a good fire on this evening of the\r\nfirst of May. Now _madame pour quelque chose tres interessante_.\r\n\r\nHow limited is human foresight! How truly are we the sport of\r\naccident. To-morrow I had proposed to visit Celeste, and now, alas!\r\n_cetera desunt_.\r\n\r\nLa G. may be forty-one. Something of the style and manners of _la\r\ntante de La_ R. Is about as silly; talks as much, and as much\r\nnonsense; is certainly good-tempered and cheerful; rather comely,\r\nabating a flat chest; about two inches taller than Theodosia. Things\r\nare not gone to extremities; but there is danger--poor gampy.\r\n\r\nThe election is lost by a great majority: _tant mieux_. It does not\r\nappear possible that I should make you a visit; even if La G. should\r\nnot prevent it, which ought to be hoped, some other thing of like kind\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nTell Natalie that I have just now received her letter, which she\r\nacknowledges to be in answer to _four of mine_. Of the boy you have\r\nbeen remarkably reserved in your two last letters. I conclude,\r\nhowever, that he cannot be dead, as you would, probably, have thought\r\nthat a circumstance worthy of being mentioned, at least in a\r\npostscript. Now Natalie has written me a whole page about her girl,\r\nfor which I am very grateful.\r\n\r\nWhat would you bet that La G. is not in a kind of quandary just now?\r\nGods! what a pathetic love-scene it will make if it shall go on.\r\nAdieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MISS -----\r\n\r\nNew-York, May 20, 1804. I send you a sample of that species of\r\nphilosophy which I have thought particularly suited to your cast of\r\nmind and the delicacy of your taste. You are to read from the 66th\r\npage to the 125th. What precedes and follows will fatigue, without\r\ninteresting or amusing you. Indeed, some of it will not be very\r\nintelligible, and you must not be disgusted in the outset.\r\n\r\nThe author has not noticed those advantages which personal beauty\r\nderives from intellectual improvement, or expansion of the mind\r\ntempered by commerce with the world, nor how grace and expression may\r\nbe thus heightened and improved. I wish some one would write a volume\r\non this subject. Indeed, I have had thoughts of doing it myself, and\r\nholding you up as the example to verify my theory. To this some\r\nthoughtless ones may object, that, where nature had done so much,\r\nnothing was left for the work of art. There cannot be a greater error.\r\nThe essential difference between the silly and the wise consists in\r\ntheir different capacity for improvement. Bestow what pains, offer\r\nwhat advantages you may to a dull subject, and she will remain\r\nstationary. One of taste and talents, on the contrary, extracts\r\nimprovement from every thing, and approaches perfection in proportion\r\nas the means of advancement are afforded.\r\n\r\nWhat grave nonsense, you will say, or at least think, if this should\r\nfind you, as is probable, surrounded by admirers uniting to persuade\r\nyou that you are already perfect; and in such company how stupid a\r\ncompliment will it seem to tell you that you may still improve; that\r\nthere are no limits to the improvement and approaches which you may\r\nmake towards perfection. Such, however ungallant, will be the language\r\nof your admirer and friend,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nNew-York, May 8, 1804.\r\n\r\nI think I have answered, or at least have noticed, your letter of the\r\n17th, being the last which has been received, and, as usual,\r\npostmarked nine days after its date.\r\n\r\nThe affair of La G. is becoming serious. After due reflection, this\r\ndoes appear to me to be the most discreet thing--prudence,\r\ncheerfulness, and good-temper are ingredients of importance. I will\r\noffer homage. Are you content? Answer quickly.\r\n\r\nMadame Bonaparte and husband are here. I have just seen them and no\r\nmore. For reasons unknown to me (doubtless some state policy), we are\r\nsuddenly become strangers.\r\n\r\nOf all earthly things I most want to see your boy. Does he yet know\r\nhis letters? If not, you surely must want skill, for, most certain, he\r\ncan't want genius. You must tell me of all his acquirements.\r\n\r\nIt ought to have been mentioned that I have not seen my inamorata\r\nsince the time of which I wrote you, which you may think passing\r\nstrange.\r\n\r\nMay 26, 1804.\r\n\r\nI think I will never again be so long without writing to you. It has\r\nbeen a daily and nightly reproach to me since the 8th of May, the date\r\nof the preceding part of this letter. The matter there spoken of\r\nseemed to be in so precarious a state, that I did not like to send you\r\nthat page alone, and, in fact, knew not what to add to it. It is just\r\nso now; but from that day to this I have not seen La G., owing partly\r\nto accident and partly to apathy.\r\n\r\nYour long and interesting letter of the 5th and 6th inst has been\r\nreceived. It shall be answered anon. In the mean time I repeat the\r\ninjunction that you read, and in sequence. Study philosophy, if\r\nnothing should more allure you. Darwin and Harris you have; others I\r\nwill send. Read over Shakspeare critically, marking the passages which\r\nare beautiful, absurd, or obscure. I will do the same, and one of\r\nthese days we will compare. To improve your style and language is,\r\nhowever, the most interesting point. In this you will be aided by\r\nregaining your Latin. Gods! how much you might accomplish this year.\r\n\r\nMiss Cruger, youngest daughter of the late widow Cruger, now Mrs.\r\nRogers, married two or three days ago to one of your Haywards, I think\r\nWilliam. A runaway job. _La mere et beau pere bien fachés_. How far\r\nare you from Natalie?\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nNew-York, June 11, 1804.\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 14th of May is the last, and, I believe,\r\nunanswered, which is rather scandalous on both sides; but the letter\r\nof A.B.A., at the foot of yours, was far the most interesting. I have\r\nstudied every pothook and trammel of his first literary performance,\r\nto see what rays of genius could be discovered. You remember our\r\nfriend Schweitzer, nephew and pupil of Lavater. He used to insist that\r\nas much was to be inferred from the handwriting as from the face. I\r\nshowed him a letter from a man of great fame, and he saw genius in\r\nevery stroke. I then produced a letter from an arrant blockhead and\r\ngreat knave, but so like the other as not to be distinguished, at\r\nleast by my unphysiognomical discernment. He acknowledged that there\r\nwas resemblance to an ignorant eye; but, said he, triumphantly, this\r\n(latter) could never have made that scratch, which sybilistic scratch\r\nwas the mere prolongation of the last letter of the last word in a\r\nsentence. Now it occurs to me that one of A.B.A.'s scratches is\r\nexactly in the line of genius according to Schweitzer; and surely more\r\nmay be presumed from the instinctive effort of untutored infancy than\r\nfrom the laboured essay of scientific cultivation. To aid your\r\nobservations in this line, I pray you to read Martinus Scriblerius.\r\nMr. and Mrs. Hayward are happily living with the mother.\r\n\r\nI am stationary (_not paper, wax, and quills_), but, adjectively\r\nspeaking, unlocomotive. The affair of La G. has also been perfectly\r\nstationary since my last, the parties not having met; but hearing that\r\nLa G. has expressed a sort of surprise, approaching to vexation, at\r\nthis apathy, the other party has _kindly_ promised an interview\r\nto-morrow. If it should take place, you will, in due time, know the\r\nresult. Your permission or dissent is impatiently expected by\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nNew-York, June 13, 1804.\r\n\r\nThe joint and several letter of Natalie and Theodosia was received\r\nyesterday, and will be answered to-morrow or next day. It seems that\r\nyou write once a fortnight. Two such idle sluts might find half an\r\nhour daily to give a sort of journal to papa.\r\n\r\nAnother interview yesterday with La G. One more would be fatal and\r\nfinal. I shall seek it to-day; _after which_ I will read Moore's\r\nfables, you impudence. My time, till near closing the mail, has been\r\noccupied in writing to your husband. At present I can only thank you\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nNew-York, June 24, 1804.\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow, did I say? 'Tis nowhere to be found but in the fool's\r\ncalendar;\" and yet I said \"to-morrow.\" The morrow brought me an ague\r\nin the face, which I have been nursing from that day to this, in great\r\nill-humour. 'Till yesterday I could not dispense with my mufflings,\r\nand yesterday we kept Theo.'s birthday. The Laights and half a dozen\r\nothers laughed an hour, and danced an hour, and drank her health at\r\nRichmond Hill. We had your picture in the dining-room; but, as it is a\r\nprofile, and would not look at us, we hung it up, and placed Natalie's\r\nat table, which laughs and talks with us.\r\n\r\nI do not like the boy looking pale so early in the season. It argues\r\nill; but I like much his heroism and his gallantry. You can't think\r\nhow much these little details amuse and interest me. If you were quite\r\nmistress of natural philosophy, he would now be hourly acquiring a\r\nknowledge of various branches, particularly natural history, botany,\r\nand chymistry. Pursue these studies, and also that of language. For\r\nfifty dollars you may get, in Philadelphia, a chymical apparatus, put\r\nup in a small box, with which more than one hundred experiments may be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nYour idea of dressing up pieces of ancient mythology in the form of\r\namusing tales for children is very good. You _yourself_ must write\r\nthem. Send your performances to me, and, within three weeks after they\r\nare received, you shall have them again in print. This will be not\r\nonly an amusing occupation, but a very useful one to yourself. It will\r\nimprove your style and your language, give you habits of accuracy, and\r\nadd a little to your stock of knowledge. Natalie, too, must work at\r\nit, and I'll bet that she makes the best tale. I will be your editor\r\nand your critic.\r\n\r\nYou laugh at me so much and so impudently, that I will not say a word\r\nmore of certain things till something be concluded. Your permission\r\nseems to be that I may hang or drown, or make any other apotheosis I\r\nmay please. Dear indulgent creature, how I thank thee.\r\n\r\nPray, madam, give your orders to Peggy yourself. She writes a better\r\nhand than I do, and would be so proud to receive a letter from\r\n_Missy_. I have shown her that part of your letter which concerns her,\r\nand she is now engaged in executing your commands.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nNew-York, July 1, 1804.\r\n\r\nHaving been shivering with cold all day, though in perfect health, I\r\nhave now, just at sunset, had a fire in my library, and am sitting\r\nnear it and enjoying it, if that word be applicable to any thing done\r\nin solitude. Some very wise man, however, has exclaimed,\r\n\r\n  \"Oh! fools, who think it solitude to be alone.\"\r\n\r\nThis is but poetry. Let us, therefore, drop the subject, lest it lead\r\nto another on which I have imposed silence on myself.\r\n\r\nYou may recollect, and, if you do not, your husband will, that he has\r\nseveral times requested me to open a correspondence between him and my\r\nbookseller in London. To introduce the thing, I desired Mr. White to\r\nsend with my next parcel of books a parcel for Mr. Alston, not\r\nexceeding the value of fifty guineas, and referred him to Mr. M'Kinnon\r\nfor instructions. The books came out accordingly, and, with respect to\r\nmy box, all was smooth and fair; but it was alleged by the owners of\r\nthe ship and by the captain, that the box for Mr. Alston, having been\r\nirregularly shipped, occasioned the seizure and detention of the ship,\r\nand the owners refused to deliver the box unless I would pay thirty\r\nguineas damages. This I declined, and the box was taken to the\r\ncustom-house, where it has lain these six weeks unopened. After the\r\nexpiration of nine months it will be opened, and the contents sold at\r\nauction by order of the officers of the customs. I shall write to the\r\nbookseller, Mr. White, to employ his own agent here to look to the box\r\nas his property. This trifling tale would not have been told but to\r\nshow Mr. Alston that I really have made an attempt to establish a\r\ncorrespondence for him.\r\n\r\nYou ought to be collecting a few books for your own use. One way of\r\nforming a small library, and which I recommend to you, is to note down\r\nthe title of every book which, either from its reputation or from\r\nperusal, you may wish to possess. Make you a small memorandum book for\r\nthis purpose. If they be written on loose scraps, by the time you get\r\na dozen eleven of them will be lost. I recommend to you a new\r\npublication called the Edinburgh Review. One number is issued every\r\nthree months. The plan of the editors differs from that of similar\r\nworks in that they give more copious extracts, and notice only books\r\nof merit or _reputation_.\r\n\r\nI wait impatiently for some of your tales. No hasty scrawls, madam,\r\nfor I will correct nothing. We have now here three shiploads of South\r\nCarolinians, who all find the weather intolerably hot, though I have\r\nslept under a blanket every night except one in all June.\r\n\r\nJerome Bonaparte has taken Belvidere for the season. The two French\r\nfrigates remain here blockaded. C. C. says you are a good-for-nothing,\r\nlazy ****** (I really cannot write her words; they are too dreadful,\r\nand must be left to your imagination to supply), because you never\r\nwrite to her, nor even answer her letters. I assented to all this.\r\n\r\nAll strangers go to see Montalto as one of the curiosities or beauties\r\nof the island. Your last letter is dated the 31st of May, whence I\r\nconclude that you submit to the labour of writing to me once a\r\nfortnight only.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n1. Matthew L.

The election for governor; Morgan Lewis and Aaron Burr being the\r\ncandidates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn February, 1804, Colonel Burr was nominated, at a public meeting\r\nheld in the city of New-York, as a candidate for the office of\r\ngovernor. At this meeting Colonel Marinus Willett presided as\r\nchairman, and Ezekiel Robbins acted as secretary. Both these gentlemen\r\nwere well known as efficient members of the democratic party. Judge\r\nMorgan Lewis was the opposing and successful candidate. This contest\r\nwas of an acrimonious character. While the great mass of the\r\ndemocratic party supported Judge Lewis, a section of that party, alike\r\ndistinguished for their talents and patriotism, sustained Colonel\r\nBurr. Nor were these divisions confined to the ranks of the democracy.\r\nAmong the federalists similar dissensions sprang up. General Hamilton,\r\nand all that portion of politicians over whom he had a controlling\r\ninfluence, opposed the election of Colonel Burr with an ardour\r\nbordering on fanaticism. The press teemed with libels of the most\r\natrocious character. An event connected with this election has\r\nrendered it memorable in the history of our state and country. A\r\nletter, written by Dr. Charles D. Cooper, and published pending the\r\nelection, ultimately led to the hostile and fatal meeting between\r\nGeneral Hamilton and Colonel Burr. Immediately after the death of the\r\nformer gentleman, Judge William P. Van Ness, the second of Colonel\r\nBurr, published the correspondence between the parties, with a\r\nstatement of the conversations he held with General Hamilton and Judge\r\nPendleton, the second of the general. As their accuracy has never been\r\ncalled in question, they are now presented in the form in which they\r\nthen appeared.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATEMENT.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the 17th of June last (1804), says Judge Van Ness,\r\nI received a note from Colonel Burr [1] requesting me to call on him\r\nthe following morning. Upon my arrival he alleged that it had, of\r\nlate, been frequently stated to him that General Hamilton had, at\r\ndifferent times and upon various occasions, used language and\r\nexpressed opinions highly injurious to his reputation; that he had for\r\nsome time felt the necessity of calling on General Hamilton for an\r\nexplanation of his conduct, but that the statements which had been\r\nmade to him did not appear sufficiently authentic to justify the\r\nmeasure; that, a newspaper had, however, been recently put into his\r\nhands, in which he perceived a letter signed Charles D. Cooper,\r\ncontaining something which he thought demanded immediate\r\ninvestigation. Urged by these circumstances, and justified by the\r\nevident opinion of his friends, he had determined to write General\r\nHamilton a note upon the subject, which he requested me to deliver. I\r\nassented to this request, and, on my return to the city, which was at\r\neleven o'clock the same morning, I delivered to General Hamilton the\r\nnote which I received from Colonel Burr for that purpose, and of which\r\nthe following is a copy.\r\n\r\nNo. I.\r\n\r\nNew-York, June 18, 1804.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI send for your perusal a letter signed Charles D. Cooper, which,\r\nthough apparently published some time ago, has but very recently come\r\nto my knowledge. Mr. Van Ness, who does me the favour to deliver this,\r\nwill point out to you that clause of the letter to which I\r\nparticularly request your attention.\r\n\r\nYou must perceive, sir, the necessity of a prompt and unqualified\r\nacknowledgment or denial of the use of any expressions which would\r\nwarrant the assertions of Mr. Cooper.\r\n\r\nI have the honour to be\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\nGeneral HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Hamilton read the note of Mr. Burr, and the printed letter of\r\nMr. Cooper to which it refers, and remarked that they required some\r\nconsideration, and that in the course of the day he would send an\r\nanswer to my office. At half past ten o'clock General Hamilton called\r\nat my house, and said that a variety of engagements would demand his\r\nattention during the whole of that day and the next; but that on\r\nWednesday, the 20th inst., he would furnish me with such an answer to\r\nColonel Burr's letter as he should deem most suitable and compatible\r\nwith his feelings. In the evening of Wednesday, the 20th, while I was\r\nfrom home, the following letter, addressed to Colonel Burr, was left\r\nat my house, under cover to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. II.\r\n\r\nNew-York, June 20, 1804.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI have maturely reflected on the subject of your letter of the 18th\r\ninst., and the more I have reflected the more I have become convinced\r\nthat I could not, without manifest impropriety, make the avowal or\r\ndisavowal which you seem to think necessary. The clause pointed out by\r\nMr. Van Ness is in these terms: \"I could detail to you _a still more\r\ndespicable_ opinion which General Hamilton _has expressed_ of Mr.\r\nBurr.\" To endeavour to discover the meaning of this declaration, I was\r\nobliged to seek in the antecedent part of this letter for the opinion\r\nto which it referred as having been already disclosed. I found it in\r\nthese words: \"General Hamilton and Judge Kent have declared, in\r\n_substance_, that they looked upon Mr. Burr to be a _dangerous man_,\r\nand one _who ought not to be trusted with the reins of government_.\"\r\n\r\nThe language of Doctor Cooper plainly implies that _he_ considered\r\nthis opinion of you, which he attributes to me, as a _despicable_ one;\r\nbut he affirms that I have expressed some other _more despicable_,\r\nwithout, however, mentioning to whom, when, or where. 'Tis evident\r\nthat the phrase \"still more despicable\" admits of infinite shades,\r\nfrom very light to very dark. How am I to judge of the degree\r\nintended? Or how shall I annex any precise idea to language so\r\nindefinite?\r\n\r\nBetween gentlemen, _despicable_ and _more despicable_ are not worth\r\nthe pains of distinction; when, therefore, you do not interrogate me\r\nas to the opinion which is specifically ascribed to me, I must\r\nconclude that you view it as within the limits to which the\r\nanimadversions of political opponents upon each other may justifiably\r\nextend, and, consequently, as not warranting the idea which Doctor\r\nCooper appears to entertain. If so, what precise inference could you\r\ndraw as a guide for your conduct, were I to acknowledge that I had\r\nexpressed an opinion of you _still more despicable_ than the one which\r\nis particularized? How could you be sure that even this opinion had\r\nexceeded the bounds which you would yourself deem admissible between\r\npolitical opponents?\r\n\r\nBut I forbear further comment on the embarrassment to which the\r\nrequisition you have made naturally leads. The occasion forbids a more\r\nample illustration, though nothing could be more easy than to pursue\r\nit.\r\n\r\nRepeating that I cannot reconcile it with propriety to make the\r\nacknowledgment or denial you desire, I will add, that I deem it\r\ninadmissible, on principle, to consent to be interrogated as to the\r\njustice of the _inferences_ which may be drawn by others from whatever\r\nI have said of a political opponent in the course of fifteen years\r\ncompetition. If there were no other objection to it, this is\r\nsufficient, that it would tend to expose my sincerity and delicacy to\r\ninjurious imputations from every person who may at any time have\r\nconceived the _import_ of my expressions differently from what I may\r\nthen have intended or may afterward recollect. I stand ready to avow\r\nor disavow promptly and explicitly any precise or definite opinion\r\nwhich I may be charged with having declared of any gentleman. More\r\nthan this cannot fitly be expected from me; and, especially, it cannot\r\nbe reasonably expected that I shall enter into any explanation upon a\r\nbasis so vague as that you have adopted. I trust, on more reflection,\r\nyou will see the matter in the same light with me. If not, I can only\r\nregret the circumstance, and must abide the consequences.\r\n\r\nThe publication of Doctor Cooper was never seen by me till after the\r\nreceipt of your letter. I have the honour to be, &c.,\r\n\r\nA. HAMILTON.\r\n\r\nColonel BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of Thursday, the 21st, I delivered to Colonel Burr the\r\nabove letter, and, in the evening, was furnished with the following\r\nletter for General Hamilton, which I delivered to him at 12 o'clock on\r\nFriday, the 22d inst.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. III.\r\n\r\nNew-York, June 21, 1804.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 20th inst. has been this day received. Having\r\nconsidered it attentively, I regret to find in it nothing of that\r\nsincerity and delicacy which you profess to value.\r\n\r\nPolitical opposition can never absolve gentlemen from the necessity of\r\na rigid adherence to the laws of honour and the rules of decorum. I\r\nneither claim such privilege nor indulge it in others.\r\n\r\nThe common sense of mankind affixes to the epithet adopted by Doctor\r\nCooper the idea of dishonour. It has been publicly applied to me under\r\nthe sanction of your name. The question is not whether he has\r\nunderstood the meaning of the word, or has used it according to syntax\r\nand with grammatical accuracy, but whether you have authorized this\r\napplication, either directly or by uttering expressions or opinions\r\nderogatory to my honour. The time \"when\" is in your own knowledge, but\r\nno way material to me, as the calumny has now first been disclosed so\r\nas to become the subject of my notice, and as the effect is present\r\nand palpable.\r\n\r\nYour letter has furnished me with new reasons for requiring a definite\r\nreply.\r\n\r\nI have the honour to be,\r\n\r\nSir, your obedient\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\nGeneral HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Hamilton perused it, and said it was such a letter as he had\r\nhoped not to have received; that it contained several offensive\r\nexpressions, and seemed to close the door to all further reply; that\r\nhe had hoped the answer he had returned to Colonel Burr's first letter\r\nwould have given a different direction to the controversy; that he\r\nthought Mr. Burr would have perceived that there was a difficulty in\r\nhis making a more specific reply, and would have desired him to state\r\nwhat had fallen from him that might have given rise to the inference\r\nof Doctor Cooper. He would have done this frankly; and he believed it\r\nwould not have been found to exceed the limits justifiable among\r\npolitical opponents. If Mr. Burr should be disposed to give a\r\ndifferent complexion to the discussion, he was willing to consider the\r\nlast letter not delivered; but if that communication was not\r\nwithdrawn, he could make no reply; and Mr. Burr must pursue such\r\ncourse as he should deem most proper.\r\n\r\nAt the request of General Hamilton, I replied that I would detail\r\nthese ideas to Colonel Burr; but added, that if in his first letter he\r\nhad introduced the idea (if it was a correct one) that he could\r\nrecollect of no terms that would justify the construction made by Dr.\r\nCooper, it would, in my opinion, have opened a door for accommodation.\r\nGeneral Hamilton then repeated the same objections to this measure\r\nwhich were stated in substance in his first letter to Colonel Burr.\r\n\r\nWhen I was about leaving him he observed, that if I preferred it, he\r\nwould commit his refusal to writing. I replied, that if he had\r\nresolved not to answer Colonel Burr's letter, that I could report that\r\nto him verbally, without giving him the trouble of writing it. He\r\nagain repeated his determination not to answer; and that Colonel Burr\r\nmust pursue such course as he should deem most proper.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of this day I reported to Colonel Burr, at his house\r\nout of town, the answer and the determination of General Hamilton, and\r\npromised to call on him again in the evening to learn his further\r\nwishes. I was detained in town, however, this evening, by some private\r\nbusiness, and did not call on Colonel Burr until the following\r\nmorning, Saturday, the 23d June. I then received from him a letter for\r\nGeneral Hamilton, which is numbered IV.; but, as will presently be\r\nexplained, never was delivered. The substance of it will be found in\r\nnumber XII.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned with this letter to the city, which was about two\r\no'clock in the afternoon of the same day, I sent a note to General\r\nHamilton's office, and also to his house, desiring to know when it\r\nwould be convenient to him to receive a communication. The servant, as\r\nhe informed me, received for answer at both places that General\r\nHamilton had gone to his country seat. I then wrote the note of which\r\nNo. V. is a copy, and sent it out to him in the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. V.\r\n\r\nJune 23, 1804.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of yesterday I reported to Colonel Burr the result of\r\nmy last interview with you, and appointed the evening to receive his\r\nfurther instructions. Some private engagements, however, prevented me\r\nfrom calling on him till this morning. On my return to the city, I\r\nfound, upon inquiry, both at your office and house, that you had\r\nreturned to your residence in the country. Lest an interview there\r\nmight be less agreeable to you than elsewhere, I have taken the\r\nliberty of addressing you this note, to inquire when and where it will\r\nbe most convenient to you to receive a communication.\r\n\r\nYour most obedient and very humble servant,\r\n\r\nW. P. VAN NESS.\r\n\r\nGeneral HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this I received for answer No. VI., which follows.\r\n\r\nNo. VI.\r\n\r\nGrange, June 23, 1804.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI was in town to-day till half past one. I thank you for the delicacy\r\nwhich dictated your note to me. If it is indispensable the\r\ncommunication should be made before Monday morning, I must receive it\r\nhere; but I should think this cannot be important. On Monday, by nine\r\no'clock, I shall be in town at my house in Cedar-street, No. 52, where\r\nI should be glad to see you. An additional reason for preferring this\r\nis, that I am unwilling to occasion you trouble.\r\n\r\nWith esteem I am your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nA. HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt nine o'clock on Monday, the 25th of June, I called on General\r\nHamilton, at his house in Cedar-street, to present the letter No. IV.\r\nalready alluded to, and with instructions for a verbal communication,\r\nof which the following notes, No. VII, handed me by Mr. Burr, were to\r\nbe the basis. The substance of which, though in terms as much softened\r\nas my injunctions would permit, was accordingly communicated to\r\nGeneral Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. VII.\r\n\r\nA. Burr, far from conceiving that rivalship authorizes a latitude not\r\notherwise justifiable, always feels greater delicacy in such cases,\r\nand would think it meanness to speak of a rival but in terms of\r\nrespect; to do justice to his merits; to be silent of his foibles.\r\nSuch has invariably been his conduct towards Jay, Adams, and Hamilton;\r\nthe only three who can be supposed to have stood in that relation to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThat he has too much reason to believe that, in regard to Mr.\r\nHamilton, there has been no reciprocity. For several years his name\r\nhas been lent to the support of base slanders. He has never had the\r\ngenerosity, the magnanimity, or the candour to contradict or disavow.\r\nBurr forbears to particularize, as it could only tend to produce new\r\nirritations; but, having made great sacrifices for the sake of\r\nharmony; having exercised forbearance until it approached to\r\nhumiliation, he has seen no effect produced by such conduct but a\r\nrepetition of injury. He is obliged to conclude that there is, on the\r\npart of Mr. Hamilton, a settled and implacable malevolence; that he\r\nwill never cease, in his conduct towards Mr. Burr, to violate those\r\ncourtesies of life; and that, hence, he has no alternative but to\r\nannounce these things to the world; which, consistently with Mr.\r\nBurr's ideas of propriety, can be done in no way but that which he has\r\nadopted. He is incapable of revenge, still less is he capable of\r\nimitating the conduct of Mr. Hamilton, by committing secret\r\ndepredations on his fame and character. But these things must have an\r\nend.\r\n\r\nBefore I delivered the written communication with which I was charged,\r\nGeneral Hamilton said that he had prepared a written reply to Colonel\r\nBurr's letter of the 21st, which he had left with Mr. Pendleton, and\r\nwished me to receive. I answered, that the communication I had to make\r\nto him was predicated upon the idea that he would make no reply to Mr.\r\nBurr's letter of the 21st of June, and that I had so understood him in\r\nour conversation of the 22d. General Hamilton said that he believed,\r\nbefore I left him, he had proffered a written reply. I observed that,\r\nwhen he answered verbally, he had offered to put that _refusal_ in\r\nwriting; but that, if he had now prepared a written reply, I would\r\nreceive it with pleasure. I accordingly called on Mr. Pendleton on the\r\nsame day (Monday, June 25th), between _one_ and _two_ o'clock P. M.,\r\nand stated to him the result of my recent interview with General\r\nHamilton, and the reference he had made to him.\r\n\r\nI then received from Mr. Pendleton No. VIII., which follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. VIII.\r\n\r\nNew-York, June 22, 1804.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nYour first letter, in a style too peremptory, made a demand, in my\r\nopinion, unprecedented and unwarrantable. My answer, pointing out the\r\nembarrassment, gave you an opportunity to take a less exceptionable\r\ncourse. You have not chosen to do it; but, by your last letter,\r\nreceived this day, containing expressions _indecorous_ and improper,\r\nyou have increased the difficulties to explanation intrinsically\r\nincident to the nature of your application.\r\n\r\nIf by a \"definite reply\" you mean the direct avowal or disavowal\r\nrequired in your first letter, I have no other answer to give than\r\nthat which has already been given. If you mean any thing different,\r\nadmitting of greater latitude, it is requisite you should explain.\r\n\r\nI have the honour to be, sir, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nALEX. HAMILTON.\r\n\r\nA. BURR, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis letter was unsealed, but I did not read it in his presence. After\r\nsome conversation relative to what General Hamilton would say on the\r\nsubject of the present controversy, during which Mr. Pendleton read\r\nfrom a paper his ideas on the subject, he left me for the purpose of\r\nseeing and consulting Mr. Hamilton, taking the paper with him. In\r\nabout an hour he called at my house. I informed him that I had shown\r\nto Colonel Burr the letter he had given me from General Hamilton;\r\nthat, in his opinion, it amounted to nothing more than the verbal\r\nreply I had already reported; that it left the business precisely\r\nwhere it then was; that Mr. Burr had very explicitly stated the\r\ninjuries he had received and the reparation he demanded, and that be\r\ndid not think it proper to be asked now for further explanation.\r\nTowards the conclusion of the conversation I informed him that Colonel\r\nBurr required a general disavowal of any intention, on the part of\r\nGeneral Hamilton, in his various conversations, to convey expressions\r\nderogatory to the honour of Mr. Burr. Mr. Pendleton replied that he\r\nbelieved General Hamilton would have no objections to make such\r\ndeclaration, and left me for the purpose of consulting him, requesting\r\nme to call in the course of the afternoon for an answer. I called on\r\nhim, accordingly, about six o'clock. He then observed that General\r\nHamilton declined making such a disavowal as I had stated in our last\r\nconversation; that he, Mr. Pendleton, did not then perceive the whole\r\nforce and extent of it; and presented me with the following paper, No.\r\nIX., which I transmitted in the evening to Mr. Burr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. IX.\r\n\r\nIn answer to a letter properly adapted to obtain from General Hamilton\r\na declaration whether he had charged Colonel Burr with any particular\r\ninstance of dishonourable conduct, or had impeached his private\r\ncharacter either in the conversation alluded to by Doctor Cooper, or\r\nin any other particular instance to be specified, he would be able to\r\nanswer consistently with his honour and the truth, in substance, that\r\nthe conversation to which Doctor Cooper alluded turned wholly on\r\npolitical topics, and did not attribute to Colonel Burr any instance\r\nof dishonourable conduct, nor relate to his private character; and in\r\nrelation to any other language or conversation of General Hamilton\r\nwhich Colonel Burr will specify, a prompt and frank avowal or denial\r\nwill be given.\r\n\r\nThe following day (Tuesday, 26th June), as early as was convenient, I\r\nhad an interview with Colonel Burr, who informed me that he considered\r\nGeneral Hamilton's proposition a mere evasion, that evinced a desire\r\nto leave the injurious impressions which had arisen from the\r\nconversations of General Hamilton in full force; that when he had\r\nundertaken to investigate an injury his honour had sustained, it would\r\nbe unworthy of him not to make that investigation complete. He gave me\r\nfurther instructions, which are substantially contained in the\r\nfollowing letter to Mr. Pendleton, No. X.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. X.\r\n\r\nJune 26, 1804.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nThe letter which you yesterday delivered to me, and your subsequent\r\ncommunication, in Colonel Burr's opinion, evince no disposition, on\r\nthe part of General Hamilton, to come to a satisfactory accommodation.\r\nThe injury complained of and the reparation expected are so definitely\r\nexpressed in Colonel Burr's letter of the 21st instant, that there is\r\nnot perceived a necessity for further explanation on his part. The\r\ndifficulty that would result from confining the inquiry to any\r\nparticular times and occasions must be manifest. The denial of a\r\nspecified conversation only would leave strong implication that on\r\nother occasions improper language had been used. When and where\r\ninjurious opinions and expressions had been uttered by General\r\nHamilton must be best known to him, and of him only will Colonel Burr\r\ninquire. No denial or declaration will be satisfactory unless it be\r\ngeneral, so as wholly to exclude the idea that rumours derogatory to\r\nColonel Burr's honour has originated with General Hamilton, or have\r\nbeen fairly inferred from any thing he has said. A definite reply to a\r\nrequisition of this nature was demanded by Colonel Burr's letter of\r\nthe 21st instant. This being refused, invites the alternative alluded\r\nto in General Hamilton's letter of the 20th.\r\n\r\nIt was required by the position in which the controversy was placed by\r\nGeneral Hamilton on Friday (June 22d) last, and I was immediately\r\nfurnished with a communication demanding a personal interview. The\r\nnecessity of this measure has not, in the opinion of Colonel Burr,\r\nbeen diminished by the general's last letter, or any communication\r\nwhich has since been received. I am, consequently, again instructed to\r\ndeliver you a message as soon as it may be convenient for you to\r\nreceive it. I beg, therefore, you will be so good as to inform me at\r\nwhat hour I can have the pleasure of seeing you.\r\n\r\nYour most obedient and humble servant,\r\n\r\nW. P. VAN NESS.\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL PENDLETON, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the evening of the same day I received from him the following\r\nanswer:--\r\n\r\nNo. XI.\r\n\r\nJune 26, 1804.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI have communicated the letter which you did me the honour to write to\r\nme of this date, to General Hamilton. The expectations now disclosed\r\non the part of Colonel Burr appear to him to have greatly extended the\r\noriginal ground of inquiry, and, instead of presenting a particular\r\nand definite case for explanation, seem to aim at nothing less than an\r\ninquisition into his most confidential conversations, as well as\r\nothers, through the whole period of his acquaintance with Colonel\r\nBurr.\r\n\r\nWhile he was prepared to meet the particular case fairly and fully, he\r\nthinks it inadmissible that he should be expected to answer at large\r\nas to every thing that he may possibly have said in relation to the\r\ncharacter of Colonel Burr at any time or upon any occasion. Though he\r\nis not conscious that any charges which are in circulation to the\r\nprejudice of Colonel Burr have originated with him, except one which\r\nmay have been so considered, and which has long since been fully\r\nexplained between Colonel Burr and himself, yet he cannot consent to\r\nbe questioned generally as to any rumours which may be afloat\r\nderogatory to the character of Colonel Burr, without specification of\r\nthe several rumours, many of them, probably, unknown to him. He does\r\nnot, however, mean to authorize any conclusion as to the real nature\r\nof his conduct in relation to Colonel Burr by his declining so loose\r\nand vague a basis of explanation, and he disavows an unwillingness to\r\ncome to a satisfactory, provided it be an honourable, accommodation.\r\nHis objection is the very indefinite ground which Colonel Burr has\r\nassumed, in which he is sorry to be able to discern nothing short of\r\npredetermined hostility. Presuming, therefore, that it will be adhered\r\nto, he has instructed me to receive the message which you have it in\r\ncharge to deliver. For this purpose I shall be at home and at your\r\ncommand to-morrow morning from eight to ten o'clock.\r\n\r\nI have the honour to be, respectfully,\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL PENDLETON.\r\n\r\nWM. P. VAN NESS, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\nI transmitted this to Colonel Burr; and, after a conference with him,\r\nin which I received his further instructions, and that no\r\nmisunderstanding might arise from verbal communication, I committed to\r\nwriting the remarks contained in No. XII., which follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. XII.\r\n\r\nWednesday morning, June 27, 1804.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nThe letter which I had the honour to receive from you, under date of\r\nyesterday, states, among other things, that, in General Hamilton's\r\nopinion, Colonel Burr has taken a very indefinite ground, in which he\r\nevinces nothing short of predetermined hostility, and General Hamilton\r\nthinks it inadmissible that the inquiry should extend to his\r\nconfidential as well as other conversations. To this Colonel Burr can\r\nonly reply, that secret whispers traducing his fame and impeaching his\r\nhonour are at least equally injurious with slanders publicly uttered;\r\nthat General Hamilton had, at no time and in no place, a right to use\r\nany such injurious expression; and that the partial negative he is\r\ndisposed to give, with the reservations he wishes to make, are proofs\r\nthat he has done the injury specified.\r\n\r\nColonel Burr's request was, in the first instance, proposed in a form\r\nthe most simple, in order that General Hamilton might give to the\r\naffair that course to which he might be induced by his temper and his\r\nknowledge of facts. Colonel Burr trusted with confidence, that, from\r\nthe frankness of a soldier and the candour of a gentleman, he might\r\nexpect an ingenuous declaration. That if, as he had reason to believe,\r\nGeneral Hamilton had used expressions derogatory to his honour, he\r\nwould have had the magnanimity to retract them; and that if, from his\r\nlanguage, injurious inferences had been improperly drawn, he would\r\nhave perceived the propriety of correcting errors which might thus\r\nhave been widely diffused. With these impressions Colonel Burr was\r\ngreatly surprised at receiving a letter which he considered as\r\nevasive, and which, in manner, he deemed not altogether decorous. In\r\none expectation, however, he was not wholly deceived; for the close of\r\nGeneral Hamilton's letter contained an intimation that, if Colonel\r\nBurr should dislike his refusal to acknowledge or deny, he was ready\r\nto meet the consequences. This Colonel Burr deemed a sort of defiance,\r\nand would have felt justified in making it the basis of an immediate\r\nmessage; but, as the communication contained something concerning the\r\nindefiniteness of the request; as he believed it rather the offspring\r\nof false pride than of reflection; and as he felt the utmost\r\nreluctance to proceed to extremities while any other hope remained,\r\nhis request was repeated in terms more explicit. The replies and\r\npropositions on the part of General Hamilton have, in Colonel Burr's\r\nopinion, been constantly, in substance, the same.\r\n\r\nColonel Burr disavows all motives of predetermined hostility, a charge\r\nby which he thinks insult added to injury. He feels as a gentleman\r\nshould when his honour is impeached or assailed; and, without\r\nsensations of hostility or wishes of revenge, he is determined to\r\nvindicate that honour at such hazard as the nature of the case\r\ndemands.\r\n\r\nThe length to which this correspondence has extended only tending to\r\nprove that the satisfactory redress, earnestly desired, cannot be\r\nattained, he deems it useless to offer any proposition except the\r\nsingle message which I shall now have the honour to deliver.\r\n\r\nWith great respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW. P. VAN NESS.\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL PENDLETON, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\nI handed this to Mr. Pendleton at twelve o'clock on Wednesday the\r\n27th. After he had perused it, agreeable to my instructions, I\r\ndelivered the message which it is unnecessary to repeat. The request\r\nit contained was acceded to. After which Mr. Pendleton remarked that a\r\ncourt was then sitting in which General Hamilton had much business to\r\ntransact, and that he had also some private arrangements to make,\r\nwhich would render some delay unavoidable. I acceded to his wish, and\r\nMr. Pendleton said he would call on me again in the course of the day\r\nor the following morning, to confer further relative to time and\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThursday, June 28th, ten o'clock P. M., Mr. Pendleton called on me\r\nwith a paper which he said contained some views of General Hamilton,\r\nand which he had received from him. I replied, that if the paper\r\ncontained a definite and specific proposition for an accommodation, I\r\nwould with pleasure receive it, and submit it to the consideration of\r\nmy principal; if not, that I must decline taking it, as Mr. Burr\r\nconceived the correspondence completely terminated by the acceptance\r\nof the invitation contained in the message I had yesterday delivered.\r\nMr. Pendleton replied that the paper did not contain any proposition\r\nof the kind I alluded to, but remarks on my last letter. I, of course,\r\ndeclined receiving it. Mr. Pendleton then took leave, and said that he\r\nwould call again in a day or two to arrange time and place. Tuesday,\r\nJuly 3d, I again saw Mr. Pendleton; and, after a few subsequent\r\ninterviews, the time when the parties were to meet was ultimately\r\nfixed for the morning of the 11th of July instant. The occurrences of\r\nthat interview will appear from the following statement, No. XIII.,\r\nwhich has been drawn up and mutually agreed to by the seconds of the\r\nparties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. XIII.\r\n\r\nColonel Burr arrived first on the ground, as had been previously\r\nagreed. When General Hamilton arrived, the parties exchanged\r\nsalutations, and the seconds proceeded to make their arrangements.\r\nThey measured the distance, ten full paces, and cast lots for the\r\nchoice of position, as also to determine by whom the word should be\r\ngiven, both of which fell to the second of General Hamilton. They then\r\nproceeded to load the pistols in each other's presence, after which\r\nthe parties took their stations. The gentleman who was to give the\r\nword then explained to the parties the rules which were to govern them\r\nin firing, which were as follows: \"The parties being placed at their\r\nstations, the second who gives the word shall ask them whether they\r\nare ready; being answered in the affirmative, he shall say--_present_!\r\nAfter this the parties shall present and fire _when they please_. If\r\none fires before the other, the opposite second shall say _one_,\r\n_two_, _three_, _fire_, and he shall then fire or lose his fire. He\r\nthen asked if they were prepared; being answered in the affirmative,\r\nhe gave the word _present_, as had been agreed on, and both parties\r\npresented and fired in succession. The intervening time is not\r\nexpressed, as the seconds do not precisely agree on that point. The\r\nfire of Colonel Burr took effect, and General Hamilton almost\r\ninstantly fell. Colonel Burr advanced towards General Hamilton with a\r\nmanner and gesture that appeared to General Hamilton's friend to be\r\nexpressive of regret; but, without speaking, turned about and\r\nwithdrew, being urged from the field by his friend, as has been\r\nsubsequently stated, with a view to prevent his being recognised by\r\nthe surgeon and bargemen who were then approaching. No further\r\ncommunication took place between the principals, and the barge that\r\ncarried Colonel Burr immediately returned to the city. We conceive it\r\nproper to add, that the conduct of the parties in this interview was\r\nperfectly proper, as suited the occasion.\"\r\n\r\nIn the interviews between Mr. Pendleton and Mr. Van Ness, they were\r\nnot able to agree in two important facts that passed on the ground.\r\n\"Mr. Pendleton expressed a confident opinion that General Hamilton did\r\nnot fire first, and that he did not fire at all at Colonel Burr. Mr.\r\nVan Ness seemed equally confident in opinion that General Hamilton did\r\nfire first; and, of course, that it must have been _at_ his\r\nantagonist.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the statement made by the friend of Colonel Burr. It is now\r\nproposed to insert such explanations of, or remarks on, the\r\ncommunications between the parties as emanated from the friend of\r\nGeneral Hamilton. None were given previous to document No. III.\r\nImmediately after that letter, dated 21st June, are the following\r\nremarks:--\r\n\r\n\"On Saturday, the 22d of June, General Hamilton for the first time\r\ncalled on Mr. Pendleton, and communicated to him the preceding\r\ncorrespondence. He informed him that, in a conversation with Mr. Van\r\nNess at the time of receiving the last letter (No. III.), he told Mr.\r\nVan Ness that he considered that letter as rude and offensive, and\r\nthat it was not possible for him to give any other answer than that\r\nMr. Burr must take such steps as he might think proper. He said,\r\nfurther, that Mr. Van Ness requested him to take time to deliberate,\r\nand then return an answer, when he might possibly entertain a\r\ndifferent opinion, and that he would call on him to receive it. That\r\nhis reply to Mr. Van Ness was, that he did not perceive it possible\r\nfor him to give any other answer than that he had mentioned, unless\r\nMr. Burr would take back his last letter, and write one which would\r\nadmit of a different reply. He then gave Mr. Pendleton the letter\r\nhereafter mentioned of the 22d of June, to be delivered to Mr. Van\r\nNess when he should call on Mr. Pendleton for an answer, and went to\r\nhis country house.\"\r\n\r\n[After No. V., dated June 23d, is the following:--]\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Pendleton understood from General Hamilton that he immediately\r\nanswered that, if the communication was pressing, he would receive it\r\nat his country house that day; if not, he would be at his house in\r\ntown the next morning at nine o'clock. But he did not give Mr.\r\nPendleton any copy of this note.\"\r\n\r\n[After No. VIII., dated June 22d, is the following:--]\r\n\r\n\"This letter, although dated on the 22d of June, remained in Mr.\r\nPendleton's possession until the 25th, within which period he had\r\nseveral conversations with Mr. Van Ness. In these conversations Mr.\r\nPendleton endeavoured to illustrate and enforce the propriety of the\r\nground General Hamilton had taken. Mr. Pendleton mentioned to Mr. Van\r\nNess as the result, that if Colonel Burr would write a letter,\r\nrequesting to know, in substance, whether, in the conversation to\r\nwhich Dr. Cooper alluded, any particular instance of dishonourable\r\nconduct was imputed to Colonel Burr, or whether there was any\r\nimpeachment of his private character, General Hamilton would declare,\r\nto the best of his recollection, what passed in that conversation; and\r\nMr. Pendleton read to Mr. Van Ness a paper containing the substance of\r\nwhat General Hamilton would say on that subject, which is as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\"General Hamilton says he cannot imagine to what Doctor Cooper may\r\nhave alluded, unless it were to a conversation at Mr. Taylor's, in\r\nAlbany, last winter (at which he and General Hamilton were present).\r\nGeneral Hamilton cannot recollect distinctly the particulars of that\r\nconversation, so as to undertake to repeat them without running the\r\nrisk of varying, or omitting what might be deemed important\r\ncircumstances. The expressions are entirely forgotten, and the\r\nspecific ideas imperfectly remembered; but, to the best of his\r\nrecollection, it consisted of comments on the political principles and\r\nviews of Colonel Burr, and the results that might be expected from\r\nthem in the event of his election as governor, without reference to\r\nany particular instance of past conduct or to private character.\"\r\n\r\n\"After the delivery of the letter of the 22d, as above mentioned, in\r\nanother interview with Mr. Van Ness, he desired Mr. Pendleton to give\r\nhim, in writing, the substance of what he had proposed on the part of\r\nGeneral Hamilton, which Mr. Pendleton did, in the following words.\"\r\n[See No. IX] [After No. XII., dated June 27th, is the following:--]\r\n\r\n\"With this letter a message was received, such as was to be expected,\r\ncontaining an invitation which was accepted, and Mr. Pendleton\r\ninformed Mr. Van Ness he should hear from him the next day as to\r\nfurther particulars.\r\n\r\n\"This letter was delivered to General Hamilton on the same evening,\r\nand a very short conversation ensued between him and Mr. Pendleton,\r\nwho was to call on him early the next morning for a further\r\nconference. When he did so, General Hamilton said he had not\r\nunderstood whether the message and answer was definitively concluded,\r\nor whether another meeting was to take place for that purpose between\r\nMr. Pendleton and Mr. Van Ness. Under the latter impression, and as\r\nthe last letter contained matter that naturally led to animadversion,\r\nhe gave Mr. Pendleton a paper of remarks in his own handwriting, to be\r\ncommunicated to Mr. Van Ness, if the state of the affair rendered it\r\nproper.\r\n\r\n\"In an interview with Mr. Van Ness on the same day, after explaining\r\nthe causes which had induced General Hamilton to suppose that the\r\nstate of the affair did not render it improper, Mr. Pendleton offered\r\nthis paper to Mr. Van Ness, but he declined receiving it, alleging\r\nthat he considered the correspondence as closed by the acceptance of\r\nthe message that he had delivered.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Pendleton then informed Mr. Van Ness of the inducements mentioned\r\nby General Hamilton in the paper for at least postponing the meeting\r\nuntil the close of the circuit; and, as this was uncertain, Mr.\r\nPendleton was to let him know when it would be convenient.\"\r\n\r\n_Remarks on the letter of June 27, 1804, which Mr. Van Ness declined\r\nto receive._\r\n\r\n\"Whether the observations on this letter are designed merely to\r\njustify the result which is indicated in the close of the letter, or\r\nmay be intended to give an opening for rendering any thing explicit\r\nwhich may have been deemed vague heretofore, can only be judged of by\r\nthe sequel. At any rate, it appears to me necessary not to be\r\nmisunderstood. Mr. Pendleton is therefore authorized to say, that in\r\nthe course of the present discussion, written or verbal, there has\r\nbeen no intention to evade, defy, or insult, but a sincere disposition\r\nto avoid extremities, if it could be done with propriety. With this\r\nview General Hamilton has been ready to enter into a frank and free\r\nexplanation on any and every object of a specific nature; but not to\r\nanswer a general and abstract inquiry, embracing a period too long for\r\nany accurate recollection, and exposing him to unpleasant criticisms\r\nfrom, or unpleasant discussions with, any and every person who may\r\nhave understood him in an unfavourable sense. This (admitting that he\r\ncould answer in a manner the most satisfactory to Colonel Burr) he\r\nshould deem inadmissible in principle and precedent, and humiliating\r\nin practice. To this, therefore, he can never submit. Frequent\r\nallusion has been made to slanders said to be in circulation. Whether\r\nthey are openly or in whispers, they have a form and shape, and might\r\nbe specified.\"\r\n\r\n\"If the alternative alluded to in the close of the letter is\r\ndefinitively tendered, it must be accepted; the time, place, and\r\nmanner to be afterward regulated. I should not think it right, in the\r\nmidst of a circuit court, to withdraw my services from those who may\r\nhave confided important interests to me, and expose them to the\r\nembarrassment of seeking other counsel, who may not have time to be\r\nsufficiently instructed in their causes. I shall also want a little\r\ntime to make some arrangements respecting my own affairs.\"\r\n\r\n\"On Friday, the 6th of July, the circuit being closed, Mr. Pendleton\r\ninformed Mr. Van Ness that General Hamilton would be ready at any time\r\nafter the Sunday following. On Monday the particulars were arranged.\r\nOn Wednesday the parties met at Weehawk, on the Jersey shore, at seven\r\no'clock A.M. The particulars of what then took place appear in the\r\nstatement, as agreed upon and corrected by the seconds of the\r\nparties.\" [See No. XIII.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOCTOR DAVID HOSACK TO WILLIAM COLEMAN.\r\n\r\nAugust 17, 1804.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nTo comply with your request is a painful task; but I will repress my\r\nfeelings while I endeavour to furnish you with an enumeration of such\r\nparticulars relative to the melancholy end of our beloved friend\r\nHamilton as dwell most forcibly on my recollection.\r\n\r\nWhen called to him upon his receiving the fatal wound, I found him\r\nhalf sitting on the ground, supported in the arms of Mr. Pendleton.\r\nHis countenance of death I shall never forget. He had at that instant\r\njust strength to say, \"This is a mortal wound, doctor;\" when he sunk\r\naway, and became to all appearance lifeless. I immediately stripped up\r\nhis clothes, and soon, alas! ascertained that the direction of the\r\nball must have been through some vital part. [2]\r\n\r\nHis pulses were not to be felt, his respiration was entirely\r\nsuspended, and, upon laying my hand on his heart and perceiving no\r\nmotion there, I considered him as irrecoverably gone. I, however,\r\nobserved to Mr. Pendleton, that the only chance for his reviving was\r\nimmediately to get him upon the water. We therefore lifted him up, and\r\ncarried him out of the wood to the margin of the bank, where the\r\nbargemen aided us in conveying him into the boat, which immediately\r\nput off. During all this time I could not discover the least symptom\r\nof returning life. I now rubbed his face, lips, and temples with\r\nspirits of hartshorn, applied it to his neck and breast, and to the\r\nwrists and palms of his hands, and endeavoured to pour some into his\r\nmouth. When we had got, as I should judge, about fifty yards from the\r\nshore, some imperfect efforts to breathe were for the first time\r\nmanifest; in a few minutes he sighed, and became sensible to the\r\nimpression of the hartshorn or the fresh air of the water. He\r\nbreathed; his eyes, hardly opened, wandered, without fixing upon any\r\nobject; to our great joy, he at length spoke. \"My vision is\r\nindistinct,\" were his first words. His pulse became more perceptible,\r\nhis respiration more regular, his sight returned. I then examined the\r\nwound to know if there was any dangerous discharge of blood; upon\r\nslightly pressing his side it gave him pain, on which I desisted. Soon\r\nafter recovering his sight, he happened to cast his eye upon the case\r\nof pistols, and observing the one that he had had in his hand lying on\r\nthe outside, he said, \"Take care of that pistol; it is undischarged,\r\nand still cocked; it may go off and do harm. Pendleton knows\"\r\n(attempting to turn his head towards him) \"that I did not intend to\r\nfire at him.\" \"Yes,\" said Mr. Pendleton, understanding his wish, \"I\r\nhave already made Dr. Hosack acquainted with your determination as to\r\nthat.\" He then closed his eyes and remained calm, without any\r\ndisposition to speak; nor did he say much afterward, except in reply\r\nto my questions. He asked me once or twice how I found his pulse; and\r\nhe informed me that his lower extremities had lost all feeling,\r\nmanifesting to me that he entertained no hopes that he should long\r\nsurvive. I changed the posture of his limbs, but to no purpose; they\r\nhad entirely lost their sensibility. Perceiving that we approached the\r\nshore, he said, \"Let Mrs. Hamilton be immediately sent for; let the\r\nevent be gradually broken to her, but give her hopes.\" Looking up we\r\nsaw his friend, Mr. Bayard, standing on the wharf in great agitation.\r\nHe had been told by his servant that General Hamilton, Mr. Pendleton,\r\nand myself had crossed the river in a boat together, and too well he\r\nconjectured the fatal errand, and foreboded the dreadful result.\r\nPerceiving, as we came nearer, that Mr. Pendleton and myself only sat\r\nup in the stern sheets, he clasped his hands together in the most\r\nviolent apprehension; but when I called to him to have a cot prepared,\r\nand he at the same moment saw his poor friend lying in the bottom of\r\nthe boat, he threw up his eyes and burst into a flood of tears and\r\nlamentation. Hamilton alone appeared tranquil and composed. We then\r\nconveyed him as tenderly as possible up to the house. The distresses\r\nof this amiable family were such that, till the first shock was\r\nabated, they were scarcely able to summon fortitude enough to yield\r\nsufficient assistance to their dying friend.\r\n\r\nUpon our reaching the house he became more languid, occasioned\r\nprobably by the agitation of his removal from the boat. I gave him a\r\nlittle weak wine and water. When he recovered his feelings, he\r\ncomplained of pain in his back; we immediately undressed him, laid him\r\nin bed, and darkened the room. I then gave him a large anodyne, which\r\nI frequently repeated. During the first day he took upward of an ounce\r\nof laudanum; and tepid anodyne fomentations were also applied to those\r\nparts nearest the seat of his pain. Yet were his sufferings during the\r\nwhole of the day almost intolerable. [3]\r\n\r\nI had not the shadow of a hope of his recovery; and Dr. Post, whom I\r\nrequested might be sent for immediately on our reaching Mr. Bayard's\r\nhouse, united with me in this opinion. General Rey, the French consul,\r\nalso had the goodness to invite the surgeons of the French frigates in\r\nour harbour, as they had had much experience in gunshot wounds, to\r\nrender their assistance. They immediately came; but, to prevent his\r\nbeing disturbed, I stated to them his situation, described the nature\r\nof his wound, and the direction of the ball, with all the symptoms\r\nthat could enable them to form an opinion as to the event. One of the\r\ngentlemen then accompanied me to the bedside. The result was a\r\nconfirmation of the opinion that had already been expressed by Dr.\r\nPost and myself.\r\n\r\nDuring the night he had some imperfect sleep, but the succeeding\r\nmorning his symptoms were aggravated, attended, however, with a\r\ndiminution of pain. His mind retained all its usual strength and\r\ncomposure. The great source of his anxiety seemed to be in his\r\nsympathy with his half-distracted--wife and children. He spoke to me\r\nfrequently of them--\"My beloved wife and children\" were always his\r\nexpressions. But his fortitude triumphed over his situation, dreadful\r\nas it was; once, indeed, at the sight of his children, brought to the\r\nbedside together, seven in number, his utterance forsook him; he\r\nopened his eyes, gave them one look, and closed them again till they\r\nwere taken away. As a proof of his extraordinary composure of mind,\r\nlet me add, that he alone could calm the frantic grief of their\r\nmother. _\"Remember, my Eliza, you are a Christian,\"_ were the\r\nexpressions with which he frequently, with a firm voice, but, in a\r\npathetic and impressive manner, addressed her. His words, and the tone\r\nin which they were uttered, will never be effaced from my memory.\r\nAbout two o'clock, as the public well know, he expired--\r\n\r\n  \"Incorrupta fides--nudaque veritas\r\n  Quando ullum invenient parem?\r\n  Multis ille quidem flebilis occidit.\"\r\n\r\nYour friend and humble servant,\r\n\r\nDAVID HOSACK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"After his death, a note, which had been written the evening before\r\nthe interview, was found addressed to the gentleman who accompanied\r\nhim to the field; thanking him with tenderness for his friendship to\r\nhim, and informing him where would be found the keys of certain\r\ndrawers in his desk, in which he had deposited such papers as he had\r\nthought proper to leave behind him, together with his last will.\"\r\nAmong these papers was the following.\r\n\r\nOn my expected interview with Colonel Burr, I think it proper to make\r\nsome remarks explanatory of my conduct, motives, and views.\r\n\r\nI was certainly desirous of avoiding this interview for the most\r\ncogent reasons.\r\n\r\n1. My religious and moral principles are strongly opposed to the\r\npractice of duelling, and it would ever give me pain to be obliged to\r\nshed the blood of a fellow-creature in a private combat forbidden by\r\nthe laws.\r\n\r\n2. My wife and children are extremely dear to me, and my life is of\r\nthe utmost importance to them in various views.\r\n\r\n3. I feel a sense of obligation towards my creditors; who, in case of\r\naccident to me, by the forced sale of my property, may be in some\r\ndegree sufferers. I did not think myself at liberty, as a man of\r\nprobity, lightly to expose them to this hazard.\r\n\r\n4. I am conscious of no _ill will_ to Colonel Burr distinct from\r\npolitical opposition, which, as I trust, has proceeded from pure and\r\nupright motives.\r\n\r\nLastly, I shall hazard much, and can possibly gain nothing by the\r\nissue of the interview.\r\n\r\nBut it was, as I conceive, impossible for me to avoid it. There were\r\n_intrinsic_ difficulties in the thing, and _artificial_ embarrassments\r\nfrom the manner of proceeding on the part of Colonel Burr.\r\n\r\n_Intrinsic_, because it is not to be denied that my animadversions on\r\nthe political principles, character, and views of Colonel Burr have\r\nbeen extremely severe; and, on different occasions, I, in common with\r\nmany others, have made very unfavourable criticisms on particular\r\ninstances of the private conduct of this gentleman.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as these impressions were entertained with sincerity,\r\nand uttered with motives and for purposes which might appear to me\r\ncommendable, would be the difficulty (until they could be removed by\r\nevidence of their being erroneous) of explanation or apology. _The\r\ndisavowal required of me by Colonel Burr, in a general and definite\r\nform, was out of my power_, if it had really been proper for me to\r\nsubmit to be so questioned; but I was sincerely of the opinion that\r\nthis could not be; and in this opinion I was confirmed by that of a\r\nvery moderate and judicious friend whom I consulted. Besides that,\r\nColonel Burr appeared to me to assume, in the first instance, a tone\r\nunnecessarily peremptory and menacing, and, in the second, positively\r\noffensive. Yet I wished, as far as might be practicable, to leave a\r\ndoor open for accommodation. This, I think, will be inferred from the\r\nwritten communications made by me and by my direction, and would be\r\nconfirmed by the conversations between Mr. Van Ness and myself which\r\narose out of the subject.\r\n\r\nI am not sure whether, under all the circumstances, I did not go\r\nfurther in the attempt to accommodate than a punctilious delicacy will\r\njustify. If so, I hope the motives I have stated will excuse me.\r\n\r\nIt is not my design, by what I have said, to affix any odium on the\r\ncharacter of Colonel Burr in this case. _He doubtless has heard of\r\nanimadversions of mine which bore very hard upon him_; and it is\r\nprobable that, as usual, they were accompanied with some falsehoods.\r\nHe may have supposed himself under a necessity of acting as he has\r\ndone. I hope the grounds of his proceeding have been such as ought to\r\nsatisfy his own conscience.\r\n\r\nI trust, at the same time, that the world will do me the justice to\r\nbelieve _that I have not censured him on light grounds_ nor from\r\nunworthy inducements. _I certainly have had strong reasons for what I\r\nhave said, though it is possible that in some particulars I have been\r\ninfluenced by misconstruction or misinformation_. It is also my ardent\r\n_wish that I may have been more mistaken than I think I_ have been,\r\nand that he, by his future conduct, may show himself worthy of all\r\nconfidence and esteem, and prove an ornament and blessing to the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAs well, because it is possible that I may have injured Colonel Burr,\r\nhowever convinced myself that my opinions and declarations have been\r\nwell founded, as from my general principles and temper in relation to\r\nsimilar affairs, I have resolved, if our interview is conducted in the\r\nusual manner, and it pleases God to give me the opportunity, to\r\nreserve and throw away my first fire, and I have thoughts even of\r\nreserving my second fire, and thus giving a double opportunity to\r\nColonel Burr to pause and to reflect.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, my intention to enter into any explanations on the\r\nground--apology from principle, I hope, rather than pride, is out of\r\nthe question.\r\n\r\nTo those who, with me, abhorring the practice of duelling, may think\r\nthat I ought on no account to add to the number of bad examples, I\r\nanswer, that my _relative_ situation, as well in public as private,\r\nenforcing all the considerations which men of the world denominate\r\nhonour, imposed on me (as I thought) a peculiar necessity not to\r\ndecline the call. The ability to be in future useful, whether in\r\nresisting mischief or effecting good, in those crises of our public\r\naffairs which seem likely to happen, would probably be inseparable\r\nfrom a conformity with prejudice in this particular.\r\n\r\nA.H.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe impression which the death of General Hamilton made on every class\r\nof people in the city of New-York is best described by simply\r\nremarking, that all party distinction was lost in the general\r\nsentiment of respect expressed for the illustrious dead. On Wednesday\r\nmorning, the 11th of July, 1804, the parties met; on Thursday, the\r\n12th, General Hamilton died; and on Saturday, the 14th, he was\r\ninterred, with military honours, \"the Society of the Cincinnati being\r\ncharged with the direction of the funeral ceremonies of its\r\npresident-general.\" About noon, the different bodies forming the\r\nprocession took their respective places. The body was conducted from\r\nthe house of his brother-in-law, John B. Church, Esq., to Trinity\r\nChurch, where an appropriate oration was delivered by the Hon.\r\nGouverneur Morris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nNew-York, July 10, 1804.\r\n\r\nHaving lately written my will, and given my private letters and papers\r\nin charge to you, I have no other direction to give you on the subject\r\nbut to request you to burn all such as, if by accident made public,\r\nwould injure any person. This is more particularly applicable to the\r\nletters of my female correspondents. All my letters, and copies of\r\nletters, of which I have retained copies, are in the six blue boxes.\r\nIf your husband or any one else (no one, however, could do it so well\r\nas he) should think it worth while to write a sketch of my life, some\r\nmaterials will be found among these letters.\r\n\r\nTell my dear Natalie that I have not left her any thing, for the very\r\ngood reason that I had nothing to leave to any one. My estate will\r\njust about pay my debts and no more--I mean, if I should die this\r\nyear. If I live a few years, it is probable things may be better. Give\r\nNatalie one of the pictures of me. There are three in this house; that\r\nof Stewart, and two by Vanderlyn. Give her any other little tokens she\r\nmay desire. One of those pictures, also, I pray you to give to Doctor\r\nEustis. To Bartow something--what you please.\r\n\r\nI pray you and your husband to convey to Peggy the small lot, not\r\nnumbered, which is the fourth article mentioned in my list of\r\nproperty. It is worth about two hundred and fifty dollars. Give her\r\nalso fifty dollars in cash as a reward for her fidelity. Dispose of\r\nNancy as you please. She is honest, robust, and good-tempered. Peter\r\nis the most intelligent and best-disposed black I have ever known. (I\r\nmean the black boy I bought last fall from Mr. Turnbull.) I advise\r\nyou, by all means, to keep him as the valet of your son. Persuade\r\nPeggy to live with you if you can.\r\n\r\nI have desired that my wearing apparel be given to Frederic. Give him\r\nalso a sword or pair of pistols.\r\n\r\nBurn immediately a small bundle, tied with a red string, which you\r\nwill find in the little flat writing-case--that which we used with the\r\ncurricle. The bundle is marked _\"Put.\"_\r\n\r\nThe letters of _Clara_ (the greater part of them) are tied up in a\r\nwhite handkerchief, which you will find in the blue box No. 5. You may\r\nhand them to Mari, if you please. My letters to Clara are in the same\r\nbundle. You, and by-and-by Aaron Burr Alston, may laugh at _gamp_ when\r\nyou look over this nonsense.\r\n\r\nMany of the letters of _Clara_ will be found among my ordinary\r\nletters, filed and marked, sometimes _\"Clara\"_, sometimes \"L.\"\r\n\r\nI am indebted to you, my dearest Theodosia, for a very great portion\r\nof the happiness which I have enjoyed in this life. You have\r\ncompletely satisfied all that my heart and affections had hoped or\r\neven wished. With a little more perseverance, determination, and\r\nindustry, you will obtain all that my ambition or vanity had fondly\r\nimagined. Let your son have occasion to be proud that he had a mother.\r\nAdieu. Adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\nI have directed that the flat writing-case and the blue box No. 5,\r\nboth in the library, be opened only by you. There are six of these\r\nblue boxes, which contain my letters and copies of letters, except\r\nthose two clumsy quarto volumes, in which letter-press copies are\r\npasted. They are somewhere in the library. The keys of the other five\r\nboxes are in No. 5.\r\n\r\nIt just now occurs to me to give poor dear Frederic my watch. I have\r\nalready directed my executors here to give him my wearing apparel.\r\nWhen you come hither you must send for Frederic, and open your whole\r\nheart to him. He loves _me_ almost as much as Theodosia does; and he\r\ndoes love _you_ to adoration.\r\n\r\nI have just now found four packets of letters between _Clara and\r\nMentor_ besides those in the handkerchief. I have thrown them loose\r\ninto box No. 5. What a medley you will find in that box!\r\n\r\nThe seal of the late General Washington, which you will find in the\r\nblue box No. 5, was given to me by Mr. and Mrs. Law. You may keep it\r\nfor your son, or give it to whom you please.\r\n\r\nAssure Mrs. Law of my latest recollection. Adieu. Adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH ALSTON.\r\n\r\nNew-York, July 10, 1804.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nYou will find enclosed a statement of my affairs. Swartwout and Van\r\nNess are joint executors with you and Theodosia. It was indispensable\r\nthat there should be an executor on the spot. I have directed them to\r\nsell immediately my horses, and to sell nothing else until your\r\npleasure shall be known. I pray that Theodosia may be consulted and\r\ngratified in this particular.\r\n\r\nExplanations of every concern of my property is given in two sheets of\r\npaper which accompany my will. The enclosed is an abstract.\r\n\r\nIt would have been a great satisfaction to me to have had your\r\nassurance that you would assume my debts, and take and dispose of the\r\nproperty at discretion. It may be done in a way which you would find a\r\nconvenience. My creditors would take your assumption at such time as\r\nyou might judge convenient. The property will, undoubtedly, produce\r\nmore than the amount of my debts. What you may not incline to keep may\r\nbe forthwith turned into cash.\r\n\r\nThe library, maps, pictures, and wine are articles which you will\r\nneed, and which you cannot procure without great trouble and more\r\nmoney. I think, too, you would do well to retain Richmond Hill, as a\r\nmore convenient residence than Montalto, particularly as no expense\r\nwill be necessary for buildings or improvements.\r\n\r\nMy private letters I have directed to be put in the hands of\r\nTheodosia, that she may select from them her own, those of her mother,\r\nand some others. Among them and my copies you will find much of\r\ntrifling, something of amusement, and a little of interest.\r\n\r\nGet from Mr. Taylor (the younger), of Columbia or Camden, my letters\r\nto his brother-in-law, the late J.E. Hunt, who was one of your\r\nchancellors.\r\n\r\nMessrs. R. Bunner, William Duer, John Duer, and J.W. Smith, of this\r\ncity, and John Van Ness Yates, of Albany, all lawyers and young men of\r\ntalents, have manifested great and disinterested zeal in my favour on\r\nsome recent occasions. [4]\r\n\r\nI pray you to take some notice of them, and give to each of them, and\r\nto William T. Broome, now in Paris, some small token of remembrance of\r\nme. William T. Broome, with great defects of temper, unites very\r\nconsiderable literary talents and acquirements. A little attention\r\nwould attach them all to you.\r\n\r\nMy very worthy friend, Charles Biddle, of Philadelphia, has six or\r\nseven sons--three of them grown up. With different characters and\r\nvarious degrees of intelligence, they will all be men of eminence and\r\nof influence. Call to see the father when you pass through\r\nPhiladelphia, and receive the sons kindly.\r\n\r\nI have taught my friends in every quarter to look to you as my\r\nrepresentative. There are many of them, your discernment will\r\ndistinguish which, on whose loyalty and firmness you may rely through\r\nall changes.\r\n\r\nI have called out General Hamilton, and we meet tomorrow morning. Van\r\nNess will give you the particulars. The preceding has been written in\r\ncontemplation of this event. If it should be my lot to fall, * * * * *\r\n* * * yet I shall live in you and your son. I commit to you all that\r\nis most dear to me--my reputation and my daughter. Your talents and\r\nyour attachment will be the guardian of the one--your kindness and\r\nyour generosity of the other. Let me entreat you to stimulate and aid\r\nTheodosia in the cultivation of her mind. It is indispensable to her\r\nhappiness and essential to yours. It is also of the utmost importance\r\nto your son. She would presently acquire a critical knowledge of\r\nLatin, English, and all branches of natural philosophy. All this would\r\nbe poured into your son. If you should differ with me as to the\r\nimportance of this measure, suffer me to ask it of you as a last\r\nfavour. She will richly compensate your trouble.\r\n\r\nMost affectionately adieu,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe elder Prevost, [5] Augustine James Frederic Prevost, is a most\r\namiable and honourable man. Under the garb of coarse rusticity you\r\nwill find, if you know him, refinement, wit, a delicate sense of\r\npropriety, the most inflexible intrepidity, incorruptible integrity,\r\nand disinterestedness. I wish you could know him; but it would be\r\ndifficult, by reason of his diffidence and great reluctance to mingle\r\nwith the world. It has been a source of extreme regret and\r\nmortification to me that he should be lost to society and to his\r\nfriends. The case seems almost remediless, for, alas! _he is married!_\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you can pardon and indulge a folly, I would suggest that Madame\r\nSansay, too well known under the name of Leonora, has claims on my\r\nrecollection. She is now with her husband at St. Jago of Cuba.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n1. Colonel Burr then resided at Richmond Hill.\r\n\r\n2. For the satisfaction of some of General Hamilton's friends, I\r\nexamined his body after death, in presence of Dr. Post and two other\r\ngentlemen. I discovered that the ball struck the second or third false\r\nrib, and fractured it about in the middle; it then passed through the\r\nliver and diaphragm, and, as far as we could ascertain without a\r\nminute examination, lodged in the first or second lumbar vertebra. The\r\nvertebra in which it was lodged was considerably splintered, so that\r\nthe spiculae were distinctly perceptible to the finger. About a pint\r\nof clotted blood was found in the cavity of the belly, which had\r\nprobably been effused from the divided vessels of the liver.\r\n\r\n3. As his habit was delicate, and had been lately rendered more feeble\r\nby ill health, particularly by a disorder of the stomach and bowels, I\r\ncarefully avoided all those remedies which are usually indicated on\r\nsuch occasions.\r\n\r\n4. They supported Colonel Burr for the office of governor in\r\nopposition to Morgan Lewis.\r\n\r\n5.

The malignant federalists or tories,\r\nand the imbittered Clintonians, unite in endeavouring to excite public\r\nsympathy in his favour and indignation against his antagonist.\r\nThousands of absurd falsehoods are circulated with industry. The most\r\nilliberal means are practised in order to produce excitement, and, for\r\nthe moment, with effect.\r\n\r\nI propose leaving town for a few days, and meditate also a journey for\r\nsome weeks, but whither is not resolved. Perhaps to Statesburgh. You\r\nwill hear from me again in about eight days.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH ALSTON.\r\n\r\nJuly 18, 1804.\r\n\r\nThe event of which you have been advised has driven me into a sort of\r\nexile, and may terminate in an actual and permanent ostracism. Our\r\nmost unprincipled Jacobins are the loudest in their lamentations for\r\nthe death of General Hamilton, whom, for many years, they have\r\nuniformly represented as the most detestable and unprincipled of\r\nmen--the motives are obvious. Every sort of persecution is to be\r\nexercised against me. A coroner's jury will sit this evening, being\r\nthe _fourth_ time. The object of this unexampled measure is to obtain\r\nan inquest of murder. Upon this a warrant will issue to apprehend me,\r\nand, if I should be taken, no bail would probably be allowed. You know\r\nenough of the temper and principles of the generality of the officers\r\nof our state government to form a judgment of my position.\r\n\r\nThe statement [1] in the Morning Chronicle was not submitted to my\r\nperusal, I being absent at the time of the publication. Several\r\ncircumstances not very favourable to the deceased are suppressed; I\r\npresume, from holy reverence for the dead. I am waiting the report of\r\nthis jury; when that is known, you shall be advised of my movements.\r\nAt present I have decided on nothing. Write under cover to Charles\r\nBiddle, Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nJuly 20, 1804.\r\n\r\nLa G. has, on a recent occasion, manifested a degree of sensibility\r\nand attachment which have their influence on _gamp_. Her conduct is\r\nalso highly honourable to the independence of her mind, for all her\r\nassociations and connexions would lead to a different result. An\r\ninterview is expected this evening, which, if it take place, will\r\nterminate in something definitive.\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, a pretty ludicrous description which you received. On\r\nthe other side you may add, real good-temper and cheerfulness; a good\r\neducation, according to the estimation of the world. I shall journey\r\nsomewhere within a few days, but whither is not yet decided. My heart\r\nwill travel southward, and repose on the hills of Santee.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear child.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH ALSTON.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, July 29, 1804.\r\n\r\nThe coroner's jury continued to the 26th (my last New-York date) to\r\nsit and adjourn. Upon suspicion that my friends had some knowledge of\r\nthe subject, derived either from Van Ness or me, _warrants_ have\r\nissued to bring them in to testify. Matthew L. Davis was apprehended,\r\nand, refusing to answer, was committed to prison, where he now lies;\r\nprobably Colonel Willett is now also in jail on the same account.\r\nSwartwout, Van Ness, and others are secreted. How long this sort of\r\npersecution may endure cannot be conjectured.\r\n\r\nThe ferment, which was with so much industry excited, has subsided,\r\nand public opinion begins to take its proper course.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM JOHN SWARTWOUT.\r\n\r\nNew-York, August 2, 1804.\r\n\r\nI was interrupted in my letter yesterday. The jury agreed to their\r\nverdict this morning at _two_ o'clock, _viz_., wilful murder by the\r\nhand of A. B. William P. Van Ness and Nathaniel Pendleton accessories\r\nbefore the fact. The only evidence, Bishop Moore. Edward Ferris, James\r\nFerris, and a Mr. Milne dissented, and contemplate a protest against\r\nthe illegal conduct of the coroner. Their counsel is James Woods. At\r\nfour o'clock this morning I despatched an express to Van Ness. The\r\nprinters, you perceive, continue their malevolence through the vilest\r\nmotives; notwithstanding all this, there is a considerable reaction.\r\nThe public palate has become satiated. The Nicholsons, the Gelstons,\r\nthe Mills's, and may other demo's are rapidly travelling back to 1800.\r\nMr. P. called and begged that the Chronicle might still be kept\r\nsilent. He observed, that he mixed with these people, and found it to\r\nbe the true policy. Although this is not my opinion, yet we must be\r\ngoverned by the advice of the majority.\r\n\r\nThe oration (by Gouverneur Morris) has displeased many republicans of\r\nthe first water. Governor Morgan Lewis speaks of the proceedings\r\nopenly as disgraceful, illiberal, and ungentlemanly. In short, a\r\nlittle more noise on their side, and a little further magnanimity on\r\nours, is all that is necessary. In all this bustle, judicious men see\r\nnothing but the workings of the meanest passions. The Salem Gazette\r\nand the Boston Chronicle seem to take the most correct ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH ALSTON.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, August 3, 1804.\r\n\r\nThe preceding is a summary of the intelligence by this day's mail. The\r\npurport of the inquest is confirmed by a letter from J.B.P. I am\r\nfurther advised that an application has been made to Governor Lewis,\r\nof New-York, requiring him to demand me of the governor of this state,\r\nwith which Lewis will most probably be obliged to comply. I shall,\r\nnevertheless, remain here some days (from 8 to 20), that I may the\r\nbetter know the measures of the enemy. _Have no anxiety about the\r\nissue of this business._\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, August 2, 1804.\r\n\r\nYour letters of the 8th and 18th of July are received; the latter\r\nyesterday. You must not complain or find fault if I omit to answer, or\r\neven to write. Don't let me have the idea that you are dissatisfied\r\nwith me a moment. I can't just now endure it. At another time you may\r\nplay the Juno if you please. Your letters amuse and console me.\r\nContinue to write with this reliance, and without the expectation of\r\npay in kind. I owe you no thanks for a letter if you demand prompt\r\npayment to the full amount.\r\n\r\nAll you write of the boy represents him such as I would have him. His\r\nrefusal of the peaches reminded me of his mother. Just so she has done\r\nfifty times, and just so I kissed her; but then I did not give her\r\npeaches.\r\n\r\nNothing can be done with Celeste. There is a strange indecision and\r\ntimidity which I cannot fathom. The thing, however, is abandoned; and,\r\nfor a few months, I believe, all such things.\r\n\r\nI shall be here for some days. How many cannot now be resolved. I am\r\nvery well, and not without occupation or amusement. Nothing would give\r\nme so much pleasure as to hear that your time, or any part of it, is\r\nusefully employed.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, August 3, 1804.\r\n\r\nYou will have learned, through Mr. Alston, of certain measures\r\npursuing against me in New-York. I absent myself from home merely to\r\ngive a little time for passions to subside, not from any apprehension\r\nof the final effects of proceedings in courts of law. They can, by no\r\npossibility, eventually affect my person. You will find the papers\r\nfilled with all manner of nonsense and lies. Among other things,\r\naccounts of attempts to assassinate me. These, I assure you, are mere\r\nfables. Those who wish me dead prefer to keep at a very respectful\r\ndistance. No such attempt has been made nor will be made. I walk and\r\nride about here as usual.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, August 11, 1804.\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 25th July finds me in a moment of great occupation,\r\nbeing on the point of embarking for St. Simons. Write to me on receipt\r\nof this, and enclose to the postmaster at Darien, Georgia. The letter\r\nto me to be addressed to A. B., at Hampton, St. Simons; and pray write\r\nover again all you have written since the 25th, for the letters now on\r\nthe way will not be received for some time. I shall lay a plan for\r\nmeeting you somewhere, but whether I may have it in my power to visit\r\nthe high hills of Santee is doubtful; I fear improbable. They say\r\nthere is no going through the flat country at this season without\r\nhazard of life. Consult your husband about this, and write me as above\r\ndirected. You shall hear from me the moment of my arrival anywhere;\r\nthat is, I shall write, and you may read as soon as you can get the\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nIf any male friend of yours should be dying of ennui, recommend to him\r\nto engage in a duel and a courtship at the same time--prob. est.\r\n\r\nCeleste seems more pliant. I do believe that eight days would have\r\nproduced some grave event; but, alas! those eight days, and perhaps\r\neight days more, are to be passed on the ocean.\r\n\r\nMy love to Natalie; to her girl and your boy. I have received a very\r\ncharming letter from her, which shall be noticed when I get the other\r\nside of you. Adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH ALSTON.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, August 11, 1804.\r\n\r\nYour letters of the 21st and 25th July are just now received, and I\r\nhave barely time to read them and transmit your orders to New-York\r\nabout Montalto.\r\n\r\nMy plan is to visit the Floridas for five or six weeks. I have desired\r\nTheodosia to consult you whether there be any healthy point within a\r\nhundred miles or so of St. Simons at which we might meet. Might I\r\nsafely travel through your low country at this season?\r\n\r\nTheodosia fat and the boy pale are bad omens. For God's sake, or\r\nrather for theirs, your own, and mine, hurry them off to the\r\nmountains. I could, perhaps, as easily find you there as elsewhere.\r\nWarrants have been issued in New-York against all those charged with\r\nan agency in the death of General Hamilton, but no requisition or\r\ndemand has been made by the governor of that state on this or any\r\nother, nor does it seem very probable that such demand will be\r\nimmediately made.\r\n\r\nI am negotiating to get an assurance from authority that I shall be\r\nbailed, on receipt of which I shall surrender.\r\n\r\nThe eastern republicans take part against the calumniators in\r\nNew-York. Swartwout is now here. He thinks the tide has already turned\r\nin New-York. You had better open a correspondence with him.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nHampton, St. Simon's, August 28, 1804.\r\n\r\nWe arrived on Saturday evening, all well. The mail, which arrives but\r\nonce a week, had just gone. An accidental opportunity enables me to\r\nforward this to Savannah.\r\n\r\nI am at the house of Major Butler, comfortably settled. A very\r\nagreeable family within half a mile. My project is to go next week to\r\nFlorida, which may take up a fortnight or ten days, and soon after my\r\nreturn to go northward, by Augusta and Columbia, if I can find ways\r\nand means to get on; but I have no horse, nor does this country\r\nfurnish one. In my letter to your husband, written at the moment of\r\nleaving Philadelphia, I desired him to name some place (healthy place)\r\nat which he could meet me. Enclose to \"Mr. R. King, Hampton, St.\r\nSimon's.\"\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nSt. Simon's, August 31, 1804.\r\n\r\nI am now quite settled. My establishment consists of a housekeeper,\r\ncook, and chambermaid, seamstress, and two footmen. There are,\r\nbesides, two fishermen and four bargemen always at command. The\r\ndepartment of laundress is done abroad. The plantation affords plenty\r\nof milk, cream, and butter; turkeys, fowls, kids, pigs, geese, and\r\nmutton; fish, of course, in abundance. Of figs, peaches, and melons\r\nthere are yet a few. Oranges and pomegranates just begin to be\r\neatable. The house affords Madeira wine, brandy, and porter. Yesterday\r\nmy neighbour, Mr. Couper, sent me an assortment of French wines,\r\nconsisting of Claret, Sauterne, and Champagne, all excellent; and at\r\nleast a twelve months' supply of orange shrub, which makes a most\r\ndelicious punch. Madame Couper added sweetmeats and pickles. The\r\nplantations of Butler and Couper are divided by a small creek, and the\r\nhouses within one quarter of a mile of each other; accessible,\r\nhowever, only by water. We have not a fly, moscheto, or bug. I can sit\r\na whole evening, with open windows and lighted candles, without the\r\nleast annoyance from insects; a circumstance which I have never beheld\r\nin any other place. I have not even seen a cockroach.\r\n\r\nAt Mr. Couper's, besides his family, there are three young ladies,\r\nvisitors. One of them arrived about three months ago from France, to\r\njoin a brother who had been shipwrecked on this coast, liked the\r\ncountry so much that he resolved to settle here, and sent for this\r\nsister and a younger brother. About the time of their arrival, the\r\nelder brother was accidentally drowned; the younger went with views to\r\nmake an establishment some miles inland, where he now lies dangerously\r\nill. Both circumstances are concealed from the knowledge of\r\nMademoiselle Nicholson. In any event, she will find refuge and\r\nprotection in the benevolent house of Mr. Couper.\r\n\r\nThe cotton in this neighbourhood, on the coast southward to the\r\nextremity of Florida, and northward as far as we have heard, has been\r\ntotally destroyed. The crop of Mr. C. was supposed to be worth one\r\nhundred thousand dollars, and not an extravagant estimate, for he has\r\neight hundred slaves. He will not get enough to pay half the expenses\r\nof the plantation. Yet he laughs about it with good humour and without\r\naffectation. Butler suffers about half this loss. Part of his force\r\nhad been turned to rice. My travelling companion, secretary, and\r\naid-de-camp is Samuel Swartwout, the youngest brother of John, a very\r\namiable young man of twenty or twenty-one.\r\n\r\nNow, verily, were it not for the intervention of one hundred miles of\r\nlow, swampy, pestiferous country, I would insist on your coming to see\r\nme, all, all! Little _gamp_, and Mademoiselle Sum_tare_, and their\r\nappendages; for they are the principals.\r\n\r\nI still propose to visit Florida. To set off in three or four days,\r\nand to return hither about the 16th of September; beyond this I have\r\nat present no plan. It is my wish, God knows how ardently I wish, to\r\nreturn by land, and pass a week with you; but, being without horses,\r\nand there being no possibility of hiring or buying, the thing seems\r\nscarcely practicable. Two modes only offer themselves--either to\r\nembark in the kind of mail stage which goes from Darien through\r\nSavannah, Augusta, and Columbia, to Camden, or to take a water passage\r\neither to Charleston or Georgetown. Either of these being\r\naccomplished, new difficulties will occur in getting from Statesburgh\r\nnorthward. I must be at New-York the first week in November. Consult\r\nyour husband, and write me of these matters. Enclose to Mr. Roswell\r\nKing, which I repeat, lest my former letters should not have been\r\nreceived. Our mail has just arrived, but has brought me no letter.\r\n\r\nI erred a little in my history of the family of Mademoiselle N. There\r\nare still two brothers here. One a man d'une certaine age. Though not\r\nwealthy, they are not destitute of property.\r\n\r\nMr. C. has just now gone with his boat for the dashers who live about\r\nthirty miles southwest on the main. He has requested me to escort\r\nMadame C. on Sunday to his plantation on the south end of this island,\r\nwhere we are to meet him and his party on Monday, and bring them home\r\nin our coach. Madame C. is still young, tall, comely, and well bred.\r\n\r\nI have been studying all the maps and gazetteers to discover the best\r\naccess to Statesburgh. Georgetown seems to be the nearest port; but\r\nwhether there be thence a direct road, I cannot discover. Does our\r\nfriend Doctor Blythe still reside at Georgetown? If so, I should\r\nrepose on him for the means of transportation. Desire Mari to write to\r\nhim to aid me in case I should take that route. If I should go to\r\nCharleston, meaning to Sullivan's Island, for Charleston I shall at\r\nthis season most certainly avoid, I should put myself on General\r\nM'Pherson, who, I hear, is now living there with his family; thence up\r\nthe Cooper river, about four miles above the town, is a ferryhouse and\r\ntavern on the north side, and thence by Strawberry, where is the best\r\ntavern in the state, is a very direct and beautiful road, and thence,\r\naccording to the maps, a very straight road to the high hills of\r\nSantee. But how to get from that ferryhouse is a question I cannot\r\nresolve. All these circumstances are mentioned that I may have your\r\nadvice, meaning that of your husband. And, after all, it is possible\r\nthat I may not be able to find a passage either to Charleston or\r\nGeorgetown, and so be obliged to sail for New-York. Will close this\r\nletter, for to-morrow it must go to the postoffice at Darien, which is\r\nonly about twenty-two miles distant.\r\n\r\nSeptember 1.\r\n\r\nIn one of Mr. Alston's letters he spoke of taking you and A. B. A. to\r\nthe mountains; and, in a letter which I wrote him from Philadelphia, I\r\nproposed to meet you in the mountains. Now, for aught which I as yet\r\nknow, it will be as easy for me to get to the mountains, or to the\r\nAlps, or the Andes, as to Statesburgh, and therefore, as before, I\r\ncrave counsel.\r\n\r\nDo yon recollect the second daughter of Mr. Barclay, of Philadelphia,\r\nthe sister of Nelly? She has grown up the very image of her sister. I\r\nsaw her very often while I was last in Philadelphia. She talked\r\nperpetually of you, and made me promise that I would tell you so.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear Theodosia. Remember that I have not received a letter\r\nfrom you since that of the 22d or 25th of July. I forget which was the\r\ndate. I have no faith in the climate of your high hills, surrounded as\r\nthey are by noxious swamps. God bless and preserve thee.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nSt. Simon's, September 3, 1804.\r\n\r\nYou see me returned from Gaston's Bluff, now called _Hamilton's\r\nBluff_, a London merchant, partner of Mr. Couper. We were four in the\r\ncarriage; the three ladies and myself.\r\n\r\nMr. Morse informs you that this island is forty-five miles long, and\r\nthat it lies north of the mouth Altamaha, commonly spelled Alatamaha.\r\nIt is, in fact, twelve and a half miles in length, and lies southeast\r\nof that river. Its width is about two and a half miles. There are now\r\nresiding on the island about twenty-five white families. Frederica,\r\nnow known only by the name of _Old Town_, is on the west side of the\r\nisland, and about midway between its northern and southern\r\nextremities. It was first settled by Governor Oglethorpe, and was,\r\nabout fifty years ago, a very gay place, consisting of perhaps\r\ntwenty-five or thirty houses. The walls of several of them still\r\nremain. Three or four families only now reside here. In the vicinity\r\nof the town several ruins were pointed out to me, as having been,\r\nformerly, country seats of the governor, and officers of the garrison,\r\nand gentlemen of the town. At present, nothing can be more gloomy than\r\nwhat was once called Frederica. The few families now remaining, or\r\nrather residing there, for they are all new-comers, have a sickly,\r\nmelancholy appearance, well assorted with the ruins which surround\r\nthem. The southern part of this island abounds with fetid swamps,\r\nwhich must render it very unhealthy. On the northern half I have seen\r\nno stagnant water.\r\n\r\nMr. Couper, with his escort of ladies, was to have met us this\r\nafternoon, but he has sent us word that he is taken ill on the way;\r\nthat, owing to illness in the family of the ladies who were to have\r\naccompanied him, they have been obliged to renounce the visit. We\r\ntherefore returned as we went. At Frederica and Gaston's Bluff we were\r\nconvinced that insects can subsist on this island. Moschetoes, flies,\r\nand cockroaches abounded.\r\n\r\nThursday, September 6, 1804\r\n\r\nJust returned from Darien. And what took you to Darien? To see the\r\nplantation of Mr. Butler on an island opposite that town, and to meet\r\na day sooner the letters which I expected from you. In the last object\r\nI have been again disappointed, which I ascribe wholly to the\r\nirregularity of the mails. It is most mortifying and vexatious to be\r\nseven weeks without hearing of you or from you, and now a whole week\r\nmust elapse before I can expect it.\r\n\r\nYou are probably ignorant that Darien is a settlement (called a town)\r\non the north bank of the Alatamaha, about eight miles from its mouth.\r\nMajor Butler's Island in this river is one mile below the town. It\r\nmust become a fine rice country, for the water is fresh four miles\r\nbelow Major Butler's, and the tide rises from four to five feet, and\r\nthe flats or swamps are from five to seven miles in width for a\r\nconsiderable distance up the river. The country, of course, presents\r\nno scenes for a painter. I visited Little St. Simon's and several\r\nother islands; frightened the crocodiles, shot some rice-birds, and\r\ncaught some trout. Honey of fine flavour is found in great abundance\r\nin the woods about the mouth of the river, and, for aught I know, in\r\nevery part of the country. You perceive that I am constantly\r\ndiscovering new luxuries for my table. Not having been able to kill a\r\ncrocodile (alligator), I have offered a reward for one, which I mean\r\nto eat, dressed in soup, fricassees, and steaks. Oh! how you long to\r\npartake of this repast.\r\n\r\nWednesday, September 12, 1804.\r\n\r\nOn Friday last, hearing that Mr. Couper had returned and was very\r\nseriously ill, I took a small canoe with two boys, and went to see\r\nhim. He lay in a high fever. When about to return in the evening, the\r\nwind had risen so that, after an ineffectual attempt, I was obliged to\r\ngive it up, and remain at Mr. C.'s. In the morning the wind was still\r\nhigher. It continued to rise, and by noon blew a gale from the north,\r\nwhich, together with the swelling of the water, became alarming. From\r\ntwelve to three, several of the out-houses had been destroyed; most of\r\nthe trees about the house were blown down. The house in which we were\r\nshook and rocked so much that Mr. C. began to express his\r\napprehensions for our safety. Before three, part of the piazza was\r\ncarried away; two or three of the windows bursted in. The house was\r\ninundated with water, and presently one of the chimneys fell. Mr. C.\r\nthen commanded a retreat to a storehouse about fifty yards off, and we\r\ndecamped, men, women, and children. You may imagine, in this scene of\r\nconfusion and dismay, a good many incidents to amuse one if one had\r\ndared to be amused in a moment of much anxiety. The house, however,\r\ndid not blow down. The storm continued till four, and then very\r\nsuddenly abated, and in ten minutes it was almost a calm. I seized the\r\nmoment to return home. Before I had got quite over, the gale rose from\r\nthe southeast and threatened new destruction. It lasted great part of\r\nthe night, but did not attain the violence of that from the north; yet\r\nit contributed to raise still higher the water, which was the\r\nprincipal instrument of devastation. The flood was about seven feet\r\nabove the height of an ordinary high tide. This has been sufficient to\r\ninundate great part of the coast; to destroy all the rice; to carry\r\noff most of the buildings which were on low lands, and to destroy the\r\nlives of many blacks. The roads are rendered impassable, and scarcely\r\na boat has been preserved. Thus all intercourse is suspended. The\r\nmail-boat, which ought to have passed northward last Saturday, and by\r\nwhich it was intended to forward this letter, has not been heard of.\r\nThis will go by a man who will attempt to get from Darien to Savannah\r\non foot, being sent express by the manager of Major Butler; but how,\r\nor whether it will go on from Savannah, is not imagined.\r\n\r\nMajor Butler has lost nineteen negroes (drowned), and I fear his whole\r\ncrop of rice, being about two hundred and sixty acres. Mr. Brailsford,\r\nof Charleston, who cultivates in rice an island at the mouth of the\r\nAlatamaha, has lost, reports say, seventy-four blacks. The banks and\r\nthe buildings on the low lands are greatly injured. We have heard\r\nnothing from the southward, nor farther than from Darien northward. I\r\ngreatly fear that this hurricane, so it is here called, has extended\r\nto the Waccama.\r\n\r\nThe illness of Mr. C., which still continues, and the effects of the\r\nstorm, have defeated all my plans. To get to Florida seems now\r\nimpracticable; nor do any present means occur of getting from this\r\nisland in any direction. Young Swartwout, who went ten days ago to\r\nSavannah, has not returned, nor is it possible that he should very\r\nspeedily return. I have not received a letter since my arrival from\r\nany person north of Savannah (yes, one from C. Biddle, of 19th\r\nAugust), nor do I expect one for many days to come.\r\n\r\nI had taken up another sheet to say something more, I know not what;\r\nbut the appearance of a fine sheep's-head smoking on the table has\r\nattractions not to be resisted. _Laissez moi diner_, \"and then,\" &c.\r\n\r\n_Madame j'ais bien diner_, and _j'ai fait mettre mon_ writing-desk\r\n_sur le table a diner_. What a scandalous thing to sit here all alone\r\ndrinking Champagne--and yet--(_madame je bois a votre santé et a celle\r\nde monsieur_ votre fils)--and yet, I say, if Champagne be that\r\nexhilarating cordial which (_je bois a la santé de Madame Sumtare_)\r\nsongs and rumour ascribe to it (_a la santé de Mademoiselle Sumtare_),\r\ncan there be ever an occasion in which its application could be more\r\nappropriate, or its virtues more (_mais buvons a la santé de mon hôte\r\net bon ami_, Major Butler). By-the-by, you have no idea--how should\r\nyou have, seeing that you never heard a word about it?--you have no\r\nidea, I was going to say, of the zeal and animation, of the\r\nintrepidity and frankness with which he avowed and maintained--but I\r\nforget that this letter goes to Savannah by a negro, who has to swim\r\nhalf a dozen creeks, in one of which, _at least_, it is probable he\r\nmay drown, and that, if he escape drowning, various other accidents\r\nmay bring it to you through the newspapers, and then how many enemies\r\nmight my indiscretion create for a man who had the sensibility and the\r\nhonour to feel and to judge, and the firmness to avow (_a la santé de\r\nCeleste un_ bumper toast). _La pauvre Celeste_. Adieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nFrederica, St. Simon's, September 15, 1804.\r\n\r\nHaving very unexpectedly procured a boat, I left my house yesterday\r\nafternoon, came hither by land, and proceed in a few minutes for St.\r\nMary's. It is possible that I may extend my tour to St. John's, and\r\neven to St. Augustine's; but, if so, it will be very rapid; a mere\r\nflight, for I propose to be at home (Hampton, St. Simon's) again in\r\neight days.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th I sent by a special messenger, who was to go from Darien\r\nto Savannah on foot, my journal for the ten or fifteen days preceding,\r\nwith some account of the hurricane; but a man this day from Darien\r\nsays that our express can by no possibility reach Savannah; for that\r\nevery bridge and causeway is destroyed, and the road so filled with\r\nfallen trees as to be utterly impassable. I apprehend that the roads\r\non the whole coast as far north, at least, as Cape Hatteras, are in\r\nthe same condition. If on my return I should receive intelligence\r\nconfirming those apprehensions, it will compel me to abandon the hope\r\nof seeing you until the last of February. On this, as on all other\r\noccasions, let me find that you exhibit the firmness which I have been\r\nproud to ascribe to you. Let me hear that you are seriously engaged in\r\nsome useful pursuit. Let me see the progressive improvement of your\r\nmind, and it will console me for all the evils of life.\r\n\r\nMy young friend Swartwout is still absent, and I suppose at Savannah.\r\nIt is not probable that I shall see him again before my return to\r\nNew-York.\r\n\r\nA Mr. Bartram, of Philadelphia, travelled through Georgia and the\r\nFloridas in 1772. His travels are published in one large octavo\r\nvolume. Procure and read it, and you will better understand what I may\r\nwrite you. I promise myself much gratification in this little trip. If\r\nan opportunity should offer for Charleston by water, I shall venture a\r\nletter to you. This will be forwarded before my return; if not, it\r\nwill lay here. I am writing to you before sunrise, and am now summoned\r\nto the boat (canoe).\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nHampton, St. Simon's, September 26, 1804.\r\n\r\nI returned yesterday from my Florida excursion, about which I wrote\r\nyou on the 15th inst. The weather prevented me from going farther than\r\nthe river St. John's, about thirty miles from St. Augustine. I have\r\nbeen making out for you a journal of my tour, but I still entertain a\r\nslight hope of seeing you somewhere within a fortnight; if at all, it\r\nwill be by the 10th of October. Pray keep yourselves in readiness to\r\nmeet me at Columbia, or still more southward if I should require it.\r\n\r\nNot a line from you or your husband since those of the 25th of July.\r\nYour letters have either been lost in the hurricane or are now in the\r\nmail-boat, which, by some mistake, has brought down the Darien mail\r\nand carried it on more southward, so that it will not reach Darien\r\ntill I am off; yet I entertain a hope of finding letters at Savannah.\r\n\r\nA boat has at length been found to take me to Savannah, and thither I\r\ngo to-morrow, or rather set out, for I shall not reach it till the\r\n30th instant. What course I shall take thence will be determined by\r\nwhat I may hear at that city. You will have a line from me as soon as\r\nI arrive there; meaning always that the line will be written, and sent\r\non by the first mail, to get to you as soon as it can.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact that the Spanish ladies smoke segars. They say that a\r\nyoung lady will take a few puffs and hand it to her favoured lover as\r\na mark of great kindness. This rumour, however, I cannot verify from\r\npersonal observation, much less have I to boast of any such favour.\r\nBut we will talk of these things if we should meet; if not, we will\r\nwrite about them.\r\n\r\nI was treated with great kindness and respect at St. Mary's, and have\r\neverywhere experienced the utmost hospitality. My health has been\r\nperfect and uninterrupted. God bless thee.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nSavannah, October 1, 1804. Ten o'clock A.M., arrived in a storm\r\n(northeast). They had last evening a minor hurricane here, for the\r\nspecial use of this city. It overset some canoes, drowned a few\r\nnegroes, unroofed some houses, and forced in a few windows. It was the\r\naffair of a few minutes, confined to a small space, and did no other\r\nmischief that I learn.\r\n\r\nMy last letter to you was from St. Simon's, about the 27th ult., the\r\nday previous to my departure. My voyage hither was full of variety,\r\nand not of the most pleasant kind, but no accident to affect health.\r\nMy first reflection on landing was that I was one hundred miles nearer\r\nto you; but my inquiries since my arrival afford no prospect of\r\ngetting on by land, except by the purchase of horses, to which there\r\nis one insuperable objection. The condition of the roads has not yet\r\nadmitted of travelling northward or westward in a carriage. The mail\r\ngoes on horseback.\r\n\r\nNot a line from any creature north of this place since I left\r\nPhiladelphia. I hear, however, that the Darien mail, which I passed at\r\nFrederica, as mentioned with vexation in my last, had letters for me,\r\ndoubtless from you.\r\n\r\nI was kindly interrupted in these idle regrets by visitors, who\r\ncontinued in succession till dinner was announced. At the\r\nlodging-house, where rooms were provided for me, were the governor, a\r\nScotch merchant, and a sea captain. In the evening a band of music\r\ncame under the window, which I supposed to be a compliment to the\r\ngovernor, till one of the gentlemen who accompanied it came in and\r\nsaid that a number of citizens at the door wished to see the\r\nvice-president. Interrupted again.\r\n\r\nTuesday, October 2.\r\n\r\nFirstly, your pardon is craved for this torn sheet; it was entire when\r\nI commenced, but one half went last night to answer a note, there\r\nbeing no paper in the house, and Peter abroad with my key. You have\r\nnot, I think, been introduced to Peter, my _now_ valet. It is a black\r\nboy purchased last fall. An intelligent, good-tempered, willing\r\nfellow, about fifteen; a dirty, careless dog, who, with the best\r\nintentions, is always in trouble by sins of omission or commission.\r\nThe latter through inadvertence, and often through excess of zeal.\r\nAbout three times a day, sometimes oftener, I get angry enough to\r\nchoke him, but his honesty and good-nature prevail. In my will, made\r\nabout the 10th of July, I recommend him to you as valet to A.B.A.\r\n\r\nI have been this morning scouring the town and the docks in quest of\r\nways and means to get on. There is a packet which will sail for\r\nCharleston on Saturday; a great way off to one so impatient as the\r\nwriter of this. No stage nor a horse to be hired. Finding that the\r\nmail does not close till seven this evening, this letter shall be kept\r\nopen till the last moment, and shall not be closed till I have settled\r\nsome plan of getting forward, either to Statesburgh or New-York. It\r\nwill, I think, be Statesburgh. Six hours hence you shall know. Have\r\npatience, my dear child, for six hours.\r\n\r\nLest I should forget it, let me now tell you that I am received with\r\nthe warmest hospitality. Notwithstanding the desolation occasioned by\r\nthe hurricane (and it is truly distressing), I have invitations which\r\nit would require weeks to satisfy. These attentions are almost\r\nexclusively from republicans.\r\n\r\nFour o'clock P. M.\r\n\r\n_Io triumphe!_ A letter; two, three letters. Two from you and one from\r\nyour husband. Since writing I have had other good luck; _viz_., two\r\ngentlemen have offered me each an excellent horse to go as far as\r\nStatesburgh by any route I may please. Another horse, and I am made.\r\nNote, my young friend Swartwout is with me, and I cannot well part\r\nwith him. If another horse shall be found, I shall take the route\r\nthrough Orangeburgh, as being the most direct to Statesburgh. If the\r\nland route shall for any reason be found impracticable, I shall take\r\npossession of a Charleston packet, and perhaps take it on to\r\nGeorgetown. By one way or the other you shall see me within ten or\r\ntwelve days. Tell Mari that his letter being received this afternoon,\r\nand the postmaster having just now sent me word that the mail is about\r\nto close, I can only answer him thus.\r\n\r\nYou are now to keep your ground and expect me at the hills. Pray let\r\nA.B.A. know that _gamp_ is a black man, otherwise he may be shocked at\r\nthe appearance of A.B., who is now about the colour of Peter Yates.\r\nNot brown, but a true quadroon yellow; whether from the effects of\r\nclimate, or travelling four hundred miles in a canoe, is no matter.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nFayetteville, October 23, 1804. I get on as usual; arrived here this\r\nforenoon, but detained all day by some trifling repairs to the\r\ncarriage. I promised you a journal in the manner of modern travels, to\r\nshow you how such books could be made without facts or ideas. My first\r\nfour days, to wit, from Statesburgh to this place, would, I find, from\r\nnotes which I have actually taken, make about one hundred pages, and\r\ntwo hundred in the manner of Rochefoucault d'Liancourt; but the labour\r\nof so much writing has alarmed and almost discouraged me.\r\n\r\nNo more pauses, not even for weather, till Richmond, distant two\r\nhundred miles, and proposed to be travelled in five days. I know no\r\nperson in this place but Mr. Grove, late member of Congress, who has\r\nnot called on me. Tell your husband that I have heard nothing worthy\r\nof being communicated. Since I began to write it has begun to rain, as\r\nif to test my determination not to be stopped by weather. Adieu, chere\r\nT.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWarrenton, October 27, 1804.\r\n\r\nWe parted at Fayetteville. The morning following I started one hour\r\nbefore day, the moon showing us the way, and, at about seven or eight\r\nin the evening, was at Raleigh, being full fifty miles. It was a hard\r\nday's journey, and greater than will be made again on this trip. The\r\nfatigues of the day were in some measure compensated by the very\r\nhospitable reception which I met from the _negroes_ of the capital of\r\nNorth Carolina. I reposed till nine the next morning, and came the\r\nnext day only to Louisburgh (twenty-nine miles), where I slept in the\r\nlittle up-stairs room which you once occupied; but there is a new\r\nlandlord. The Jew is broke up. The wind had been two days strong at\r\nnortheast, threatening a storm, and raining a little from time to\r\ntime. Last night it came on in earnest, raining and blowing\r\nvehemently. So I lay abed again till nine, and, after breakfasting for\r\ntwo hours, set off at eleven in all the storm. At twelve it began to\r\nsnow, and continued to snow most plentifully till night. The ground\r\nlooked like the depth of winter in Albany. Poor Andrew was almost\r\nperished; and _gamp's_ hands were nearly frozen; still we kept on, and\r\ngot here about five, being twenty-five miles. It will take me full\r\nthree days more to reach Richmond, and perhaps longer, for the roads\r\nare so gullied as to be barely passable. This afternoon, stopping at a\r\ntavern and calling for the hostler, the man told me that, _foreseeing_\r\nthe storm, he had sent him for a load of wood.\r\n\r\nA gentleman who passed here yesterday says he left Major Butler on the\r\nway, going to Georgia by land. When I sat down to write my head was\r\nfull of totally different matters; but, having gone on so far with\r\nroad incidents, the other concerns must be omitted.\r\n\r\nMy landlord has just been telling me that Swartwout passed here eight\r\ndays ago. They were three in the stage, all very apprehensive of being\r\noverset, as they were to start at two in the morning. In the excess of\r\ncaution, they desired the landlord to give no rum to the driver. The\r\nlandlord promised, and gave orders to the barkeeper. When the driver\r\narrived, he called for a dram; was refused, and told the reason.\r\nResenting this indignity, he swore he would get drunk; went to a\r\nstore, bought rum, and got drunk. Set out at two, and overset the\r\nstage the first hour. The passengers were bruised, but not very\r\nseriously injured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH ALSTON.\r\n\r\nPetersburgh, October 31, 1804.\r\n\r\nI came here on the morning of the 29th, intending to stay two hours.\r\nThe hospitalities of the place have detained me three days. A party\r\nwas prepared for me on the evening of my arrival. There were present\r\nbetween fifty and sixty, all pure republican. An invitation from the\r\nrepublican citizens, communicated through the mayor, to a public\r\ndinner, was made in terms and in a manner which could not be declined.\r\nWe had the dinner yesterday at the hotel. In the evening I was\r\nattended by some fifteen or twenty to the theatre, where I was greatly\r\namused, particularly by Mrs. West, whom I think the best female\r\nactress in America, not excepting Mrs. Merry.\r\n\r\nI send you a collection of Curran's speeches, compiled, however, only\r\nfrom newspapers. There is reason to hope for one more perfect, made\r\nunder the inspection of the author. Burk's history has agreeably\r\ndisappointed me. I speak from the reading of thirty or forty pages. If\r\nit should gain your approbation, you may render him a service by\r\nprocuring him subscriptions at the meeting of your legislature. My\r\nhorses are at the door to take me to Richmond.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nRichmond, October 31 (Evening), 1804.\r\n\r\nHow faithfully I return you the paper which you _lent_ me at\r\nStatesburgh. This is the last sheet, and I think you will have\r\nreceived back all but one of them.\r\n\r\nMy journey hither from Drummond, at which place you left me on\r\nSaturday evening, the 27th, just going to bed, beside a comfortable\r\nfire in a furnished room (what an unconscionable parenthesis), has\r\nbeen very pleasant; but why and wherefore cannot now be told, because\r\nyou know it must be reserved for \"The Travels of A. Gamp, Esq., A.M.,\r\nLL.D., V.P.U.S.,\" &c., &c., &c., which will appear in due time.\r\n\r\nVirginia is the last state, and Petersburgh the last town in the state\r\nof Virginia, in which I should have expected any open marks of\r\nhospitality and respect. You will have seen from my note of this\r\nmorning to Mr. Alston how illy I have judged.\r\n\r\nTo think of meeting with such an actress as Mrs. West in such a place.\r\nHer voice is as sweet as Mrs. Merry's (the actress, not the other Mrs.\r\nMerry), her manners superior. In comedy she is unequalled. They say\r\nshe excites equally in tragedy. I have no doubt but she is good at\r\nevery thing. I could make you laugh at a ridiculous embarrassment, but\r\nI won't; nay, I dare not, for who knows but you may first see this in\r\nthe newspaper. Madam, this is Colonel B., V.P.U.S., all out loud. Sir,\r\nthis is Mrs.-----. Miss, this is, &c., &c. The players stand, and the\r\npit stand, and the gallery stand. No, there is no gallery. Indeed, I\r\ndon't know when I have been better entertained with a play.\r\n\r\nI arrived here about sunset. Am to dine to-morrow with Dr. B., and,\r\nfrom appearances, might be amused here a week. At the utmost I shall\r\nstay but two days, desiring to be at Washington on Monday. I am most\r\ncomfortably lodged.\r\n\r\nYoung Dr. Rush travels with Major Butler, which I forgot to mention to\r\nyour husband. Pray exert yourself to please and amuse Major Butler.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH ALSTON.\r\n\r\nWashington, November 5, 1804.\r\n\r\nI arrived last evening. You will have received my two letters of the\r\n30th ult. and 1st instant, communicating, among other things, some\r\ninformation which I received on the road respecting the feelings in\r\nBergen county, New-Jersey. Since that a grand jury has been\r\n_empannelled_, who have found an indictment of murder. The witness,\r\nParson Mason. The presiding judge, Boudinot, one of the most vehement\r\nof vehement federalists. The particulars shall be communicated as soon\r\nas I can find time to write them; they will furnish you with new\r\nmaterials for reflection. They talk of making a demand here.\r\n\r\nMy house and furniture have been sold for about twenty-five thousand\r\ndollars. Seven or eight thousand dollars of debts remain unpaid. My\r\nagents have not collected any of my debts, nor sold any of the\r\ndetached lots. The library and the wine remain. They will, I think,\r\nbecome your property.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nWashington, November 17, 1804.\r\n\r\nShall I write to her to-night, or omit it till to-morrow? Oh!\r\nto-night, dear pappy. Well, then, to-night it shall be--\"_Je vous\r\necris parceque je n'ai rien a faire_,\" &c. That's not true; fifty\r\nunanswered letters on my table pronounce it false.\r\n\r\nBut when I deliberated about writing, it was with a view to write you\r\nsense--grave sense. What a dull thing is sense. How it mars half the\r\npleasure of life, and yet how contemptible is all that has it not. Too\r\nmuch sense, by which I mean only a great deal, is very troublesome to\r\nthe possessor and to the world. It is like one carrying a huge pack\r\nthrough a crowd. He is constantly hitting and annoying somebody, and\r\nis, in turn, annoyed and jostled by every one, and he must be a very\r\npowerful man indeed if he can keep upright and force his way. Now\r\nthere appears to me to be but two modes of carrying this pack with any\r\ntolerable comfort to the owner.\r\n\r\nInterrupted. A very extraordinary visit; you shall hear as soon as\r\nthey go.\r\n\r\nThe visitors were a middle-aged gentleman; a man of fortune, of\r\nfamily; has travelled, and been received in the first circles on both\r\ncontinents; intelligent and well-informed; prompt, rapid, and\r\ndecisive. A high federalist, yet a warm and open friend of _gamp_ on\r\nall occasions. Reputed to be insane, of which this attachment may be\r\ndeemed an evidence. Such is Mr. Y. The other, Mr. S., a very handsome,\r\ngenteel young man, who never carried a pack. They sat two hours, and\r\nMr. Y. was not only rational, but amusing. The only evidence of\r\ninsanity which I have heard is that he quarrels with his dear _rib_;\r\nand if this be deemed evidence, I fear our madhouses will soon be\r\nfilled with married men. I ought to have excepted one incident, which\r\nhas been related to me as follows:----\r\n\r\nMr. R., a young lawyer of reputable connexions, but who had committed\r\nsome follies, called to visit Mr. Y. After sitting some time, \"Mr.\r\nR.,\" says Y., \"it has been reported that you are a little deranged in\r\nmind (there had, in fact, been such a report), and I have heard that\r\nwhipping has been found a sovereign remedy; indeed, in the case of the\r\nKing of England, its benefit was manifest. Now as I have a very great\r\nregard for you, and doubt whether your friends will take the trouble\r\nof administering this discipline, I will take it on myself to do it.\"\r\n\r\nTwo stout negroes were called in. The astonished R. was seized,\r\nstripped, and tied, and most unmercifully whipped. All, however, with\r\nthe utmost composure on the part of Y., and mingled with expressions\r\nof kindness. When R. was taken down, bloody, lacerated, and\r\nexhausted--\"Pray, sir, walk in and take a dish of tea.\" \"No; d---n\r\nyou.\" \"But, as you must be somewhat fatigued with the exercise,\r\nperhaps you would prefer some brandy and water.\" R. walked sullenly\r\noff, and, as soon as he had recovered, left the neighbourhood, and has\r\nnot since been heard of.\r\n\r\nBut by this digression we have lost sight of the pack. The further\r\ndiscussion of that subject must be reserved for the \"Book of Travels.\"\r\nThe \"grave sense\" is still further off, and must wait a more fit\r\noccasion. As you are skilled in ancient mythology, I pray you to\r\ninform me whether there was ever a goddess of nonsense. A god won't\r\nserve my purpose. Momus, for instance, is a loud, boisterous, rude,\r\ncoarse fellow.\r\n\r\nLeave off the _vice-president_, &c., in the direction of your letters.\r\nLet it be simply A.B. or Colonel B. Tell Mari so.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nWashington, December 4, 1804.\r\n\r\nYou have doubtless heard that there has subsisted for some time a\r\ncontention of a very singular nature between the states of New-York\r\nand New-Jersey. To what lengths it may go, or how it may terminate,\r\ncannot be predicted; but, as you will take some interest in the\r\nquestion, I will state it for your satisfaction and consideration.\r\n\r\nThe subject in dispute is which shall have the honour of hanging the\r\nvice-president. I have not now the leisure to state the various\r\npretensions of the parties, with the arguments on either side; nor is\r\nit yet known that the vice-president has made his election, though a\r\npaper received this morning asserts, but without authority, that he\r\nhad determined in favour of the New-York tribunals. You shall have due\r\nnotice of the time and place. Whenever it may be, you may rely on a\r\ngreat concourse of company, much gayety, and many rare sights; such as\r\nthe lion, the elephant, &c.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of books, since I shall write to you only by this mail,\r\ntell Mr. Alston to order out from his bookseller the British Critic\r\nand the Edinburgh Review from their commencement, and to be continued\r\nas they shall come out. To form a library is the work of time, and by\r\nhaving these books you may select and give orders without danger of\r\nimposition; for though I disclaim much reliance on the judgments of\r\nthe editors, yet from their extracts and remarks a pretty correct\r\nopinion may be formed. I recommend also that you prohibit the sending\r\nout of any folio or quarto, unless particularly ordered. Octavo is at\r\nabout half the price, and much more convenient.\r\n\r\nI hope you read Quintilian in the original, and not in translation;\r\nand let me entreat you not to pass a word or sentence without\r\nunderstanding it. If I hear a very good account of you, Stuart shall\r\nmake a picture to please you. God bless thee.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH ALSTON.\r\n\r\nWashington, December 15, 1804.\r\n\r\nThe trial of Judge Chace will not come on before the middle of\r\nJanuary. He is summoned to appear the 2d January. I regret extremely\r\nthat you cannot be present.\r\n\r\nBiddle and Dallas have written a joint letter to Governor Bloomfield,\r\nof New-Jersey, urging a nol. pros. in the case of the vice-president.\r\nDallas has, throughout this business, behaved with an independence,\r\nand open, active zeal which I could not have expected, and to which I\r\nhad no personal claim.\r\n\r\nThe leading republican members of the United States Senate have\r\naddressed a similar joint letter to the governor. Many individuals of\r\nthe same _sect_ co-operate in the measure, and have expressed their\r\nopinions by letter and in conversation. Nothing final and favourable\r\nwill promptly be done. On the other hand, nothing hostile will be\r\nattempted. I enclose you the articles of impeachment against Judge\r\nChace, as agreed upon.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nWashington, December 31, 1804.\r\n\r\nBeing the last time I shall write 1804. Now, how much wiser or better\r\nare we than this time last year? Have our enjoyments for that period\r\nbeen worth the trouble of living? These are inquiries not wholly\r\ncongenial with the compliments of the new year, so we will drop them.\r\nYou would laugh to know the occupation of my New Year's eve. It cannot\r\nbe written, but it shall at some time be told.\r\n\r\nI propose to move my quarters to-morrow, and the confusion has already\r\ncommenced, and even pervades this letter. Mrs. Merry arrived a few\r\ndays ago, and looks extremely well. Madame Turreau is supposed to be\r\nlost or captured. Mr. Chace's trial will not come on till after the\r\nmiddle of January. Peter Van Ness, the father of General John P., died\r\non the 23d instant. He has left his sons about forty thousand dollars\r\napiece.\r\n\r\nMadame, when I enclose you a book or paper, be pleased, at least, to\r\nlet me know that you or your husband have read it. Pretty business,\r\nindeed, for me to be spending hours in cutting and folding pamphlets\r\nand papers for people who, perhaps, never open them. Heaven mend you.\r\n\r\nA.

The object of\r\nthis journey has been intimated in a former letter. One motive,\r\nhowever, lays down at the bottom of my heart, and has scarcely, as\r\nyet, been avowed to myself. You will conjecture, and rightly, that I\r\nmean Celeste. That matter shall receive its final decision. Now, to\r\nconfess the truth, which, however, I have but just discovered, but for\r\nthis matter the journey would not have been taken. How little is this\r\ntruth suspected by the hundreds who are at this moment _ascribing to\r\nthe movement motives of profound political importance_.\r\n\r\nI enclose you a pamphlet written with views the most friendly to A.B.\r\nSo greatly do I differ from the author, that I have desired a friend\r\nto buy them up and burn them. I shall return to this city on the 29th.\r\nAdieu.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nWashington, January 28, 1805.\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 1st of January found me at Philadelphia, and at the\r\nmoment of leaving it. Your kind wishes came so warm from the heart,\r\nthat, in a journey of eight hundred miles, at this inclement season,\r\nthey had not yet cooled.\r\n\r\nYou treat with too much gravity the New-Jersey affair. It should be\r\nconsidered as a farce, and you will yet see it terminated so as to\r\nleave only ridicule and contempt to its abettors. The affair of\r\nCeleste is for ever closed, so there is one trouble off hand.\r\n\r\nAfter you get through the book you are now reading, which I think is\r\nAnacharsis, or is it Gibbon? you better suspend history till you have\r\ngone through B. You do wrong to read so slow the first reading of B. I\r\nhad rather you went through it like a novel, to get fixed in your mind\r\na kind of map of the whole; after which, when you come to read\r\n_scientifically_, you would better see the relations and bearings of\r\none part to another. In all journeys, whether on foot or on horseback,\r\nit is a relief to know not only where you start from, but where you\r\nare going to, and all the intermediate stages. I beg that in every\r\nletter you will give me one line about B., and ask me questions if you\r\nplease.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nWashington, February 23, 1805.\r\n\r\nI regret the unprofitable employment of your time, and sincerely hope\r\nsuch long visitations will not be repeated; but you are something to\r\nblame to have taken no books with you, and again for not finding one\r\nat Clifton, where I know there are many. Still I believe in your good\r\nintentions and in their execution. It will add greatly to my happiness\r\nto know that the cultivation of your mind is not neglected; because I\r\nknow that without it you will become unfit for the duties, as well as\r\nthe enjoyments of life. Perhaps, also, my vanity may be something\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nYour last letters are written with more correctness, and apparently\r\nwith more attention than is your habit. They have amused and pleased\r\nme much. By pleased, I mean gratified my pride. Your critical remarks\r\nare quite interesting. I advise you, as soon as you have finished a\r\nplay, novel, pamphlet, or book, immediately to write an account and\r\ncriticism of it. You can form no idea how much such a work will amuse\r\nyou on perusal a few years hence. When A.B.A. has got so far as to\r\nread stories of the most simple kind, the least pleasing part of his\r\nintellectual education is finished. I might, perhaps, have added with\r\ntruth, the most laborious part.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last public duty of any importance performed by Colonel Burr was\r\nto preside in the case of Judge Samuel Chace, who was impeached before\r\nthe Senate of the United States for high crimes and misdemeanours.\r\nColonel Burr evinced his accustomed promptitude, energy, and dignity.\r\nHis impartiality and fairness won for him the applause of opponents as\r\nwell as friends; and it may be confidently asserted, that never did\r\npresident judge, in this or any other country, more justly merit\r\napplause than did the vice-president on this occasion.\r\n\r\nThe Senate Chamber, under his immediate direction, was fitted up in\r\nhandsome style as a court, and laid out into apartments for the\r\nsenators, the House of Representatives, the managers, the accused and\r\ncounsel, the members of the executive departments, besides a\r\nsemicircular gallery constructed within the area of the chamber, which\r\nformed from its front an amphitheatre contiguous with the fixed\r\ngallery of the Senate Chamber.\r\n\r\nOn the right and left of the president of the Senate, and in a right\r\nline with his chair, there were two rows of benches, with desks in\r\nfront, and the whole front and seats covered with crimson cloth, so\r\nthat the senators fronted the auditory.\r\n\r\nThe secretary of the Senate retained his usual station in front of the\r\npresident's chair; on the left of the secretary was placed the\r\nsergeant-at-arms of the Senate, and on his right the sergeant-at-arms\r\nof the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nA temporary semicircular gallery, which consisted of three ranges of\r\nbenches, was elevated on pillars, and the whole front and seats\r\nthereof covered with green cloth. At the angles or points of this\r\ngallery there were two boxes, which projected into the area about\r\nthree feet from the line of the front, which saved the abruptness of a\r\nsquare termination, and added considerably to the effect of the coup\r\nd'oeil. In this gallery ladies were accommodated, and they assembled\r\nin numbers.\r\n\r\nOn the floor beneath this temporary gallery three benches were\r\nprovided, rising from front to rear, and also covered with green\r\ncloth; these benches were occupied by the members of the House of\r\nRepresentatives; on the right there was a spacious box, appropriated\r\nfor the members of the executive departments, foreign ministers, &c.\r\n\r\nA passage was opened in front from the president's chair to the door;\r\non the right and left hand of the president, and in front of the\r\nmembers of the House of Representatives, were two boxes of two rows of\r\nseats; that facing the president's right was occupied by the managers,\r\nthat on the other side of the bar for the accused and his counsel.\r\nThese boxes were covered with blue cloth. The marshal of the District\r\nof Columbia and a number of his officers were stationed in the avenues\r\nof the court and in the galleries.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of January, 1805, the senators were sworn as judges, and\r\nMonday, the 4th of February ensuing, was fixed as \"the day for\r\nreceiving the answer and proceeding on the trial of the impeachment of\r\nSamuel Chace.\" Accordingly, on the day appointed, the senate convened,\r\nand\r\n\r\nAfter proclamation was made that Samuel Chace should appear\r\nconformable to the summons, or that his default should be recorded,\r\nMr. Chace appeared. The president of the senate (Mr. Burr) then stated\r\nto him, that, having been summoned to answer the articles of\r\nimpeachment exhibited against him by the House of Representatives, the\r\nSenate were ready to hear any answer which he had to make; whereupon\r\nMr. Chace addressed the court.\r\n\r\nThe trial continued until Friday, the first day of March, 1805, when,\r\nat half past twelve o'clock, the court took their seats; and the\r\npresident, having directed the secretary to read the first article of\r\nimpeachment, observed, that the question would be put to each member,\r\non each article separately, as his name occurred in alphabetical\r\norder. The first article was then read. When the question was hereupon\r\nput by the president of the court, and repeated after each article as\r\nread, viz.:----\r\n\r\n_Is Samuel Chase, Esquire, guilty of a high crime or misdemeanour in\r\nthe article of impeachment just read?_ The decision was as follows:--\r\n\r\nArticle 1st. Guilty 16; not guilty 18\r\n        2d.     \"   10;     \"      24\r\n        3d.     \"   18;     \"      16\r\n       4th.     \"   18;     \"      16\r\n       5th.  Not guilty, _unanimous_.\r\n       6th.     \"    4;     \"      30\r\n       7th.     \"   10;     \"      24\r\n       8th.     \"   19;     \"      15\r\n\r\nThe president then said--\"_There not being a constitutional majority\r\non any one article, it becomes my duty to pronounce that Samuel Chace,\r\nEsquire, is acquitted on the articles of impeachment exhibited against\r\nhim by the House of Representatives_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nWashington, March 10, 1804.\r\n\r\nStill lingering here, being detained by some trifling, important\r\nconcerns of business, for trifles are important in matters of finance;\r\nnothing vexatious, however. That, I hope and believe, is past.\r\n\r\nYour anxieties about me evince a sort of sickly sensibility, which\r\nindicates that you are not well. I fear that you are suffering a\r\ndebility, arising from climate or other cause, which affects both mind\r\nand body. When you are in health you have no sort of solicitude or\r\napprehension about me; you confide that, under any circumstances, I am\r\nable to fulfil your expectations and your wishes. Resume, I pray you,\r\nthis confidence, so flattering to me, so consoling to yourself, may I\r\nadd, so justly founded?\r\n\r\nOn the 13th I shall leave this for Philadelphia. There is no reason to\r\nthink that I shall this season visit either New-York or New-Jersey.\r\nThe plan of summer operations is to go from Philadelphia to Fort Pitt\r\n(Pittsburg), thence through the states on each side of the Ohio. To\r\nvisit St. Louis and the mouth of the Missouri; thence through\r\nTennessee (where pass a month) to Orleans; and thence, either by water\r\nor land, to the Atlantic coast, not far from Yarnaco or the mouth of\r\nthe Waccama. Thus you see that you are the end of all plans, and,\r\nwherever they may begin, the termination is the same. This tour has\r\nother objects than mere curiosity. An operation of business, which\r\npromises to render the tour both useful and agreeable. I may be at\r\nPhiladelphia long enough to receive your answer to this, after which\r\nyou must _surcease_ from writing till further advice. You will hear of\r\nme occasionally on my route. Write now, therefore, all you have to\r\nsay.\r\n\r\nJust at the moment of writing the last word I receive a message from\r\nthe president informing me that Dr. Browne may have the office of\r\nsecretary of the government of Louisiana (which means the upper\r\ndistrict, whereof St. Louis is the capital). General Wilkinson is\r\nappointed governor of that territory. St. Louis is on the banks of the\r\nMississippi, about twenty miles below the mouth of the Missouri. It\r\ncontains about two hundred houses, and some very wealthy people. The\r\ninhabitants are French; retain the French manners of the last century;\r\nare said to be hospitable; gay to dissipation; the society polished\r\nand fashionable. All accounts represent the country as remarkably\r\nhealthy, fertile, and beautiful. The salary of secretary is, I think,\r\nbut eight hundred dollars per annum. Certain contingences, however,\r\nwill make it worth about double that sum. Wilkinson and Browne will\r\nsuit most admirably as eaters and laughers, and, I believe, in all\r\nother particulars.\r\n\r\nCharles Williamson has not returned from Europe, but is hourly\r\nexpected. My right of franking letters will cease on the 23d of this\r\nmonth, so that you are not to expect pamphlets, &c., by the mail. God\r\nbless thee.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nWashington, March 13, 1805.\r\n\r\nThe enclosed newspaper is just now put into my hands. It is true, as\r\nis there said, that I made a talk, as was decent and proper, to the\r\nSenate on leaving them formally. There was nothing written or\r\nprepared, except that it had been some days on my mind to say\r\nsomething. It was the solemnity, the anxiety, the expectation, and the\r\ninterest which I saw strongly painted in the countenances of the\r\nauditors, that inspired whatever was said. I neither shed tears nor\r\nassumed tenderness; but tears did flow abundantly. The story in this\r\nnewspaper is rather awkwardly and pompously told. It has been gathered\r\nup, I presume, from different relations of the facts. This newspaper\r\n(_The Washington Federalist_) has been for months past, and, for aught\r\nI know (for I read none of them), still is, one of the most abusive\r\nagainst A. Burr. I am told that several papers lately make some\r\nqualified compliments; thus, for instance, referring to Judge Chace's\r\ntrial--\"He conducted with the dignity and impartiality of an angel,\r\nbut with the rigour of a devil.\" May God have you in his holy keeping\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From the Washington Federalist, 13th March_, 1805.\r\n\r\nHaving heard much said in commendation of Mr. Burr's valedictory\r\naddress to the Senate, we have solicited and procured the following,\r\nwhich we present to our readers without comment.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, the 2d of March, 1805, Mr. Burr took leave of the Senate.\r\nThis was done at a time when the doors were closed; the Senate being\r\nengaged in executive business, and, of course, there was no\r\nspectators. It is, however, said to be the most dignified, sublime,\r\nand impressive that ever was uttered; and the effect which it produced\r\njustifies these epithets. I will give you the best account I have been\r\nable to obtain, from the relation of several senators, as well federal\r\nas republican.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Burr began by saying that he had intended to pass the day with\r\nthem, but the increase of a slight indisposition (sore throat) had\r\ndetermined him then to take leave of them. He touched lightly on some\r\nof the rules and orders of the house, and recommended, in one or two\r\npoints, alterations, of which he briefly explained the reasons and\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\n\"He said he was sensible he must at times have wounded the feelings of\r\nindividual members. He had ever avoided entering into explanations at\r\nthe time, because a moment of irritation was not a moment for\r\nexplanation; because his position (being in the chair) rendered it\r\nimpossible to enter into explanations without obvious danger of\r\nconsequences which might hazard the dignity of the Senate, or prove\r\ndisagreeable and injurious in more than one point of view; that he\r\nhad, therefore, preferred to leave to their reflections his\r\njustification; that, on his part, he had no injuries to complain of;\r\nif any had been done or attempted, he was ignorant of the authors; and\r\nif he had ever heard, he had forgotten, for, he thanked God, he had no\r\nmemory for injuries.\r\n\r\n\"He doubted not but that they had found occasion to observe, that to\r\nbe prompt was not therefore to be precipitate; and that to act without\r\ndelay was not always to act without reflection; that error was often\r\nto be preferred to indecision, that his errors, whatever they might\r\nhave been, were those of rule and principle, and not of caprice; that\r\nit could not be deemed arrogance in him to say that, in his official\r\nconduct, he had known no party--no cause--no friend; that if, in the\r\nopinion of any, the discipline which had been established approached\r\nto rigour, they would at least admit that it was uniform and\r\nindiscriminate.\r\n\r\n\"He further remarked, that the ignorant and unthinking affected to\r\ntreat as unnecessary and fastidious a rigid attention to rules and\r\ndecorum; but he thought nothing trivial which touched, however\r\nremotely, the dignity of that body; and he appealed to their\r\nexperience for the justice of this sentiment, and urged them in\r\nlanguage the most impressive, and in a manner the most commanding, to\r\navoid the smallest relaxation of the habits which he had endeavoured\r\nto inculcate and establish.\r\n\r\n\"But he challenged their attention to considerations more momentous\r\nthan any which regarded merely their personal honour and\r\ncharacter--the preservation of law, of liberty, and the Constitution.\r\nThis house, said he, is a sanctuary; a citadel of law, of order, and\r\nof liberty; and it is here--it is here, in this exalted refuge--here,\r\nif anywhere, will resistance be made to the storms of political\r\nphrensy and the silent arts of corruption; and if the Constitution be\r\ndestined ever to perish by the sacrilegious hands of the demagogue or\r\nthe usurper, which God avert, its expiring agonies will be witnessed\r\non this floor.\" [1]\r\n\r\n\"He then adverted to those affecting sentiments which attended a final\r\nseparation--a dissolution, perhaps for ever, of those associations\r\nwhich he hoped had been mutually satisfactory. He consoled himself,\r\nhowever, and them, with the reflections that, though they separated,\r\nthey would be engaged in the common cause of disseminating principles\r\nof freedom and social order. He should always regard the proceedings\r\nof that body with interest and with solicitude. He should feel for\r\ntheir honour and the national honour so intimately connected with it,\r\nand took his leave with expressions of personal respect, and with\r\nprayers, and wishes,\" &c.\r\n\r\nIn this cold relation a distant reader, especially one to whom Colonel\r\nBurr is not personally known, will be at a loss to discover the cause\r\nof those extraordinary emotions which were excited. The whole Senate\r\nwere in tears, and so unmanned that it was half an hour before they\r\ncould recover themselves sufficiently to come to order, and choose a\r\nvice-president pro tem.\r\n\r\nAt the president's, on Monday, two of the senators were relating these\r\ncircumstances to a circle which had collected round them. One said\r\nthat he wished that the tradition might be preserved as one of the\r\nmost extraordinary events he had ever witnessed. Another senator being\r\nasked, on the day following that on which Mr. Burr took his leave, how\r\nlong he was speaking, after a moment's pause, said he could form no\r\nidea; it might have been an hour, and it might have been but a moment;\r\nwhen he came to his senses, he seemed to have awakened as from a kind\r\nof trance.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of the vice-president's manner seemed to have been\r\nelevation and dignity--a consciousness of superiority, &c. Nothing of\r\nthat whining adulation; those canting, hypocritical complaints of want\r\nof talents; assurance of his endeavours to please them; hopes of their\r\nfavour, &c. On the contrary, he told them explicitly that he had\r\ndetermined to pursue a conduct which his judgment should approve, and\r\nwhich should secure the suffrage of his own conscience, and that he\r\nhad never considered who else might be pleased or displeased; although\r\nit was but justice on this occasion to thank them for their deference\r\nand respect to his official conduct--the constant and uniform support\r\nhe had received from every member--for their prompt acquiescence in\r\nhis decisions; and to remark, to their honour, that they had never\r\ndescended to a single motion of passion or embarrassment; and so far\r\nwas he from apologizing for his defects, that he told them that, on\r\nreviewing the decisions he had had occasion to make, there was no one\r\nwhich, on reflection, he was disposed to vary or retract.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Senate could compose themselves sufficiently to choose\r\na president pro tem., they calve to the following resolution:----\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, unanimously, That the thanks of the Senate be presented to\r\n_Aaron Burr_, in testimony of the impartiality, dignity, and ability\r\nwith which he has presided over their deliberations, and of their\r\nentire approbation of his conduct in the discharge of the arduous and\r\nimportant duties assigned him as president of the Senate; and that Mr.\r\nSmith, of Maryland, and Mr. White be a committee to wait on him with\r\nthis resolution.\r\n\r\n_Attest_. SAM. A. OTIS, Secretary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo which resolution Colonel Burr returned the following answer to the\r\nSenate:----\r\n\r\n\"Next to the satisfaction arising from a consciousness of having\r\ndischarged my duty, is that which is derived from the approbation of\r\nthose who have been the constant witnesses of my conduct, and the\r\nvalue of this testimony of their esteem is greatly enhanced by the\r\npromptitude and unanimity with which it is offered.\r\n\r\n\"I pray you to accept my respectful acknowledgments, and the assurance\r\nof my inviolable attachment to the interests and dignity of the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH ALSTON.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, March 22, 1805.\r\n\r\nThe enclosed paper will show you what is doing here. The subject of\r\nconvention is about to divide this state into new and inveterate\r\nparties. The old names and the old animosities of federal and\r\nrepublican will be lost, but the passions will have full scope in the\r\nnew.\r\n\r\nI am not wholly free from apprehension that you take no interest in\r\nany thing but a rice-field. Fame says that you are about to degenerate\r\ninto a mere planter. If so, it is to be lamented that you have any\r\nthing above common sense, and that you have learned any thing more\r\nthan to read and write, for all above common sense and school\r\neducation spoils the planter.\r\n\r\nThough in my former letters I did not, in express terms, inform you\r\nthat I was under ostracism, yet it must have been inferred. Such is\r\nthe fact. In New-York I am to be disfranchised, and in New-Jersey\r\nhanged. Having substantial objections to both, I shall not, for the\r\npresent, hazard either, but shall seek another country. You will not,\r\nfrom this, conclude that I have become passive, or disposed to submit\r\ntamely to the machinations of a banditti. If you should you would\r\ngreatly err.----and his clan affect to deplore, but secretly rejoice\r\nat and stimulate the villanies of all sorts which are practised\r\nagainst me. Their alarm and anxiety, however, are palpable to a degree\r\nperfectly ridiculous. Their awkward attempts to propitiate reminds one\r\nof the Indian worship of the evil spirit. God bless you ever.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, March 29, 1805.\r\n\r\nI arrived here on the 21st instant, and shall remain here yet ten\r\ndays. John W. Smith is now here. He married Miss Duer a few weeks ago,\r\nand will take her, with Frances, &c., to Orleans next month. Ann does\r\nnot go; but one younger than Susan, whose name I forget. Miss Dallas\r\nis to be married in a few days to a handsome young man, just admitted\r\nto the bar: no fortune, but said to possess talents. Poor La R. quite\r\npale and emaciated; the fruit of dissipation. Celeste as heretofore,\r\nabating the influence of time, which is a little too visible;\r\ncourteous even to flattery. La Planche a recluse. Miss Binney is to be\r\nmarried next week to Mr. Wallace, a young lawyer of this city of good\r\ncharacter and prospects.\r\n\r\nPeople who are occupied are never dull, never melancholy. I learn,\r\nthen, from your letter of the 10th, that you have been a little lazy.\r\nTo be sure, if that letter was written for publication, it would do\r\ncredit to the author; but to me, _en particulier_, other reflections\r\nmight have occurred. The story, however, is prettily told, and I kiss\r\nyour hand for some other pretty things. But let me see more of the\r\neffects of those precepts and that example.\r\n\r\nI am apprehensive that your milk diet will not carry you through the\r\nsummer. You will want stimulus of some kind. For this purpose\r\nsomething is used in all warm countries. In the West Indies they drink\r\nrum and they die. In the East Indies and China, ginseng is the\r\npanacea. Try ginseng. Some decoction or (bitter) infusion. When my\r\nstomach is out of order or wants tone, nothing serves so effectually\r\nas a cup of chamomile tea, without sugar or milk. I think this would\r\ngive you an appetite. Make the experiment. Bathing in seawater is a\r\ngrand preservative. If your bath be in the house, the best time is an\r\nhour or two before dinner. Tepid bath; none of your cold baths for\r\nsuch a machine as yours. If you have no convenience for a warm bath in\r\nthe house, set a mason to work to-morrow and make one in each of your\r\ncountry houses. It is a high evidence of the barbarism of our Southern\r\nstates that, in an extent of three hundred miles, filled with wealthy\r\npeople, and in a hot climate, there should not be, in any one private\r\nfamily, a convenient bathing-room. Perhaps, indeed, some ruined French\r\nrefugee may have expended fifty dollars to furnish himself and family\r\nthis luxury, as essential to comfort and cleanliness as to health.\r\n\r\nIn ten or twelve days I shall be on my way westward. My address, till\r\nfurther orders, is at Cincinnati, Ohio, to the care of the Hon. John\r\nSmith. As the objects of this journey, not mere curiosity, or _pour\r\npasser le tems_, may lead me to Orleans, and perhaps farther. I\r\ncontemplate the tour with gayety and cheerfulness. The most weighty\r\nsolicitude on my mind is your health and that of your boy. My letters\r\nhave given you some advice as to yourself. You will have a letter from\r\nPittsburg, and from other points as opportunities may offer, though I\r\nshall seldom be far from the route of some mail. God bless you\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, April 10, 1805.\r\n\r\nI rejoice that your nerves are in better tone, for truly, in some of\r\nyour letters, I could scarcely recognise my daughter. As to the boy, I\r\nbeseech you not to undertake to teach him the various sounds of the\r\nletters abstractedly from the words in which those sounds are found.\r\nThis must be learned arbitrarily. Go on with his a, b, &c.; and when\r\nhe shall have learned the language, and not till then, can you teach\r\nhim (or ought it to be attempted) the principles of the construction\r\nof that language.\r\n\r\nMy ostracism is enlivened by a constant succession of visitors from\r\nNew-York and New-Jersey. Swartwout and Bunner have just now come in,\r\nand I have not been a day without some _one, two_, or more. They stay\r\ngenerally two or three days with me, and I am privileged to take them\r\nwith me wherever I dine. Major Powell, the friend of Miss Keene, and\r\nthe lover of her mother, returned lately from Europe and died here\r\nlast week. He has left an estate of ten or twelve thousand guineas per\r\nannum.\r\n\r\nI met Miss Sumter (overtook meaning) at Wilmington last winter, and\r\nthence to Baltimore we rode together in the stage. She is a frank,\r\nsensible, amiable girl. May make a very interesting companion. I was\r\nso much pleased with her, that I went several times to see her (two\r\nmiles), though I visited no lady. I took her to General Van Ness's,\r\nwhere I made her at home. She plays on the piano in a style which may\r\nbe called superior, and has a most uncommon fine voice, which has been\r\nneglected.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nPittsburg, April 30, 1805.\r\n\r\nArrived in good order yesterday. Find my boat and hands ready. The\r\nwater high and weather fine. Shall set off in two hours. Have\r\ntherefore no time to give any account of my journey hither. My boat\r\nis, properly speaking, a floating house, sixty feet by fourteen,\r\ncontaining dining-room, kitchen with fireplace, and two bedrooms;\r\nroofed from stem to stern; steps to go up, and a walk on the top the\r\nwhole length; glass windows, &c. This edifice costs one hundred and\r\nthirty-three dollars, and how it can be made for that sum passes my\r\ncomprehension.\r\n\r\nI find that Frankfort will be better than Cincinnati; so address to\r\nme, Frankfort, Kentucky, to the care of the Honourable John Brown.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of April, 1805, Colonel Burr and Gabriel Shaw, who had\r\naccompanied him from Philadelphia, left Pittsburg in their boat. At\r\nthis period Colonel Burr commences, for the amusement of his daughter,\r\na journal of his adventures, which contains some interesting details\r\nexplanatory of the then situation of the western country. Extracts\r\nfrom this journal will be made. On the 2d of May they stopped at a\r\nlittle village on the north bank called M'Intosh. The next day \"went\r\non shore in the skiff (letting the ark float on) to see the town of\r\n_Wieling_, sometimes erroneously spelled _Wheeling_; a pretty, neat\r\nvillage, well situated on the south bank, containing sixty or eighty\r\nhouses, some of brick, and some of a fine free stone found in the\r\nvicinity. Saw several well-dressed women, who had the air of fashion\r\nand movements of _vous autres_ on the coast.\"\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 5th reached Marietta, on the north side,\r\n\"containing about eighty houses; some that would be called handsome in\r\nany village on the continent. After breakfast\" (says Colonel Burr)\r\n\"came in several gentlemen of the town to offer me civilities and\r\nhospitalities. We have been walking several miles to see the mounds,\r\nparapets, squares, and other remains of unknown antiquity which are\r\nfound in this neighbourhood. I am astonished and confounded; totally\r\nunsatisfied with the conjectures of others, and unable to repose on\r\nany plausible one of my own. I shall continue to write to you\r\njournal-wise, but, having no copy, you must preserve the sheets, as I\r\nmay wish to refer to them for facts and dates.\"\r\n\r\nArrived at Cincinnati on the 11th May, by the course of the river\r\nestimated to be 310 miles from Marietta. \"Meeting here with General\r\nDayton and several old army acquaintance, remained the whole day.\" In\r\nthe evening started \"for Louisville, which is at the rapids or falls\r\nof the Ohio. There it is proposed to take land, to ride through part\r\nof Kentucky, visit Lexington and Frankfort, and meet the ark again at\r\nthe mouth of the Cumberland, which empties into the Ohio about fifty\r\nmiles before its junction with the Mississippi.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nLexington (Kentucky), May 23, 1805.\r\n\r\nMy journal has grown too big to be sent by mail. I have, therefore,\r\nonly to assure you of my health and safety, without entering into any\r\nof those details which you will see anon. Shaw is with me. To-morrow\r\nwe pursue our journey by land to Nashville in Tennessee, and thence\r\ndown the Cumberland to Eddyville, where we expect to find our boat,\r\nand intend to go from that place to Orleans in ten days.\r\n\r\nArrived at Nashville on the 29th of May. \"One is astonished at the\r\nnumber of sensible, well-informed, and well behaved people which is\r\nfound here. I have been received with much hospitality and kindness,\r\nand could stay a month with pleasure; but General Andrew Jackson\r\nhaving provided us a boat, we shall set off on Sunday, the 2d of June,\r\nto navigate down the Cumberland, either to Smithland at its mouth, or\r\nto Eddyville, sixty or eighty miles above, at one of which places we\r\nexpect to find our boat, with which we intend to make a rapid voyage\r\ndown the Mississippi to Natchez and Orleans.\r\n\r\n\"Left Nashville on the 3d of June in an open boat. Came down the\r\nCumberland to its mouth, about 220 miles, in an open boat, where our\r\nark was in waiting. Reached Massac, on the Ohio, sixteen miles below,\r\non the 6th. Here found General Wilkinson on his way to St. Louis. The\r\ngeneral and his officers fitted me out with an elegant barge, sails,\r\ncolours, and ten oars, with a sergeant, and ten able, faithful hands.\r\nThus equipped, I left Massac on the 10th of June, Shaw in company.\r\n\r\n\"On the 17th arrived at Natchez, being by water, as estimated, nearly\r\neight hundred miles from Massac. Natchez is a town of three or four\r\nhundred houses; the inhabitants traders and mechanics, but surrounded\r\nby wealthy planters, among whom I have been entertained with great\r\nhospitality and taste. These planters are, many of them, men of\r\neducation and refinement; live as well as yours, and have generally\r\nbetter houses. We are now going through a settled country, and, during\r\nthe residue of my voyage to Orleans, about three hundred miles, I\r\nshall take breakfast and dinner each day at the house of some\r\ngentleman on shore. I take no letters of introduction; but, whenever I\r\nhear of any gentleman whose acquaintance or hospitalities I should\r\ndesire, I send word that I am coming to see him, and have always met a\r\nmost cordial reception.\r\n\r\n\"Edward Livingston was married about a fortnight ago to Madame Moreau,\r\n_veuve_, lately from St. Domingo, rich in beauty and accomplishments.\r\nI hear so many pleasant things of Orleans, that I should certainly (if\r\none half of them are verified on inspection) settle down there were it\r\nnot for Theodosia and her boy; but these will control my fate.\r\n\r\n\"On the 25th of June reached New-Orleans. The lady of your laughing\r\nfriend is a charming woman. She was a widow from St. Domingo; _sans\r\nargent et sans enfants_. Without a single good feature, she is very\r\nagreeable. She is nearly the size and figure of Lady Nesbet. Fair,\r\npale, with jet black hair and eyes--little, sparkling black eyes,\r\nwhich seem to be made for far other purposes than those of mere\r\nvision. Ph. Jones is to be married in a few days to a pretty little\r\nAmerican, Miss Brown. The inhabitants of the United States are here\r\ncalled Americans. I have been received with distinction.\r\n\r\n\"The mark of attention with which I have been most flattered is a\r\nletter from the holy sisters, the Ursuline nuns, congratulating me on\r\nmy arrival. Having returned a polite answer to this letter, it was\r\nintimated to me that the saints had a desire to see me. The bishop\r\nconducted me to the cloister. We conversed at first through the\r\ngrates; but presently I was admitted within, and I passed an hour with\r\nthem greatly to my satisfaction. None of that calm monotony which I\r\nexpected. All was gayety, _wit_, and sprightliness. Saint A. is a very\r\naccomplished lady. In manners and appearance a good deal like Mrs.\r\nMerry. All, except two, appear to be past thirty. They were dressed\r\nwith perfect neatness; their veils thrown back. We had a repast of\r\nwine, fruit, and cakes. I was conducted to every part of the building.\r\nAll is neatness, simplicity, and order. At parting, I asked them to\r\nremember me in their prayers, which they all promised with great\r\npromptness and courtesy--Saint A. with earnestness.\r\n\r\n\"This city is larger than I expected, and there are found many more\r\nthan would be supposed living in handsome style. They are cheerful,\r\ngay, and easy. I have promised to return here next fall. I go on the\r\n10th instant (July) by land to Kentucky, and thence, probably, to St.\r\nLouis. _A la santé Madame_ Alston, is generally the first toast at\r\nevery table I have been. Then we say some evil things of Mr. Alston.\r\n_Encore_, adieu. I will ask Saint A. to pray for thee too. I believe\r\nmuch in the efficacy of her prayers. _Le pauvre_ A.B.A., I can find\r\nnothing here to send him.\r\n\r\n\"Arrived at Nashville on the 6th August. You now see me safe through\r\nthe wilderness, though I doubt (hussey) whether you knew that I had a\r\nwilderness to pass in order to get here. Yes, about four hundred and\r\nfifty miles of wilderness. The hospitality of these people will keep\r\nme here till the 12th instant, when I shall partake of a public\r\ndinner, given not to the vice-president, but to A.B. I shall be at\r\nLexington on the 19th. I have directed Bradley's new map of the United\r\nStates to be sent to you; this will enable you to trace my route, and\r\nI pray you to study the map attentively.\r\n\r\n\"I am still at Nashville (August 13th). For a week I have been\r\nlounging at the house of General Jackson, once a lawyer, after a\r\njudge, now a planter; a man of intelligence, and one of those prompt,\r\nfrank, ardent souls whom I love to meet. The general has no children,\r\nbut two lovely nieces made a visit of some days, contributed greatly\r\nto my amusement, and have cured me of all the evils of my wilderness\r\njaunt. If I had time I would describe to you these two girls, for they\r\ndeserve it. To-morrow I move on towards Lexington.\r\n\r\n\"I ought to tell you how I came hither. It was thus: I embarked in a\r\nlittle schooner at the mouth of the Bayou St. Jean on Lake\r\nPonchartrain, and landed on the opposite side of the lake about ten\r\nmiles below the mouth of the Chefonti, a traverse of about twenty-five\r\nmiles, which I made in six hours. Took a guide, and went on next\r\nmorning in a footpath; crossed the Chefonti about four miles above its\r\nmouth, and then turned northerly; crossed the 31st degree of latitude\r\nat forty-two miles from the Mississippi. Note; this line has been\r\nactually run, and marked with great accuracy by commissioners on the\r\npart of the United States and of Spain, as the north bound of the\r\nFloridas and the south bound of the United States, till it strikes the\r\nSt. Mary's. You will see on the map. Continued on to Natchez. From the\r\nmouth of the Chefonti to Natchez by this route is about one hundred\r\nand forty miles. I was four days from New-Orleans to Natchez. Passed\r\nnear a week in the vicinity of Natchez, and saw some tears of regret\r\nwhen I left it; but I am _now_ to give you the route; my journal will\r\ngive you the incidents.\r\n\r\n\"The path from Natchez, going northward, keeps east of the Yazoo, and,\r\nI think, nearly on the dividing ridge between the waters of the Yazoo\r\nand those of the Tombigbee or Tambeckbee; a vile country, destitute of\r\nsprings and of running water--think of drinking the nasty\r\npuddle-water, covered with green scum, and full of animalculae--bah! I\r\ncrossed the Tennessee; how glad I was to get on the waters of the\r\nTennessee; all fine, transparent, lively streams, and itself a clear,\r\nbeautiful, magnificent river. I crossed it, I say, forty miles below\r\nthe muscle shoals, and three hundred and sixty above its mouth,\r\nreckoning by the meanders of the river. Thence to Nashville through\r\nthe town of Franklin. On the map you will see laid down a road from\r\nNashville to Natchez as having been cut by the order of the minister\r\nof war. This is imaginary; there is no such road.\r\n\r\n\"Arrived at Lexington on the 20th August, 1805. Left it for Frankfort,\r\ndistant twenty-two miles, on the 31st. I am magnificently lodged at\r\nthe house of John Brown, who married your old friend and neighbour\r\nMiss Mason, who is, you know, the sister of _my friend_, the priest\r\n(John Mason). She has two fine boys; the youngest, now four, I find\r\nsomething like A.B.A., and, of course, amuse myself with him a great\r\ndeal. Mrs. Brown is still handsome, and speaks of you with attachment\r\nand respect.\r\n\r\n\"My plans for the two next months are now made up, or rather imposed\r\non me by letters received since I last wrote you, and by my previous\r\nengagements. On the 1st of September I leave this for St. Louis. My\r\nroute is to Louisville, 55 miles; Vincennes, on the Wabash, 150 miles;\r\nKaskaskias, on the Mississippi, 150 miles; St. Louis, 75 miles. These\r\ndistances are probably inaccurate, but St. Louis is called 450 miles\r\nfrom this. I propose to be at Cincinnati on the 1st of October; at\r\nChilicothe and Marietta from the 7th to the 15th; at Pittsburg about\r\nthe 20th, and at Bedford till the 1st of November. If by that time I\r\nshould hear nothing from you, shall take measures for going by land or\r\nwater to Theoville, so that you see it must be late in November before\r\nI can see you.\r\n\r\n\"Arrived at Louisville (Falls of the Ohio) on the 2d of September,\r\nbeing sixty miles on my way to the Missouri. I have now again one\r\nhundred and fifty miles of wilderness to encounter. I will be at\r\nBerkeley Springs by the 20th of October, where I hope to meet you and\r\nMari. Address to me at the city of Washington.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH ALSTON.\r\n\r\nWashington, November 29, 1804.\r\n\r\nI came to Berkeley as was proposed. You were not there; no letter from\r\nyou. I sent a messenger to Washington city for intelligence, and\r\nwaited his return in unpleasant suspense. At the termination of six\r\ndays my messenger returned with letters advising that you would be at\r\nHillsborough, whither I resolved immediately to go, but thought it\r\nbest to take Washington in my way, in the hope of other letters. You\r\nwere all at the Oaks, and no movement spoken of. You were to go alone\r\nto the legislature. Wife and child to be left at the Oaks.\r\n\r\nThough oppressed with important engagements, I would nevertheless set\r\noff with the stage of this day for Georgetown and the Oaks if I could\r\nhave been assured of finding preparations ready made for the\r\ncontemplated journey of Theodosia and the boy; but as you may have\r\nleft home without attending to this point, it seemed probable that I\r\nmight make a fruitless journey of nine hundred miles; fruitless,\r\nexcept the pleasure of passing one day at the Oaks, and even this with\r\nthe alloy of your absence. My course will, therefore, be now to\r\nPhiladelphia, where I have made appointments, and either at that place\r\nor this shall wait your reply, and we must endeavour to arrange our\r\nplans with precision. Address me at this place.\r\n\r\nMy solicitude about the health of Theodosia is no way relieved by the\r\nsort of recovery of which she advises me. The boy, too, has a relapse\r\nof the ague, a disease of all others the most fatal to the infant\r\nconstitution. Great God! what sacrifices do you make, and to what end?\r\nThese solicitudes poison all my enjoyments, and often unfit me for\r\nbusiness. Being apprized from recollection of our personal\r\ncommunications last autumn, and of our correspondence last winter, of\r\nthe engagements and ties which will prevent you, at least for some\r\nmonths, from leaving South Carolina, I determine, at any sacrifice, to\r\nrescue Theodosia and son.\r\n\r\nThere will be no war with Spain unless we shall declare it, which is\r\nnot expected. England continues a course of malevolence, which will\r\nstill continue and be borne. France, more courteous in words, under\r\nthe pressure of her own affairs. Affectionately,\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe letters and extracts from the journal of Colonel Burr, which have\r\nbeen given in the preceding part of this chapter, sufficiently\r\nindicate that he was actively employed in travelling during the year\r\n1805. From January, 1806, until August following, his time was\r\nprincipally spent in the cities of Washington and Philadelphia. During\r\nthis period his correspondence [2] is voluminous, but in no manner\r\ndevelops any other views than such as relate to land speculations.\r\nCommodore Truxton, on the trial at Richmond, swore that Colonel Burr,\r\nin the latter end of July, 1806, informed him that he was about\r\nconcluding a bargain for the Washita lands. In August Mr. Burr\r\ncommenced his western tour. In the summer and autumn, and during that\r\ntour, he was brought before two different grand juries in Kentucky and\r\ndischarged. So far as any testimony was produced, it went to prove an\r\nintention of settling the Washita lands. On the 3d of March, 1807, he\r\nwas arrested, by order of the government, on a charge of treason, in\r\nthe Tombigbee country, and transported to Richmond, Virginia, for\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n1. There was something prophetic in this prediction; for a few hours\r\nafterward, in the House of Representatives, Messrs. Nicholson and\r\nRandolph were betrayed into a violence of conduct which was noticed in\r\nour last.\r\n\r\n_Editor of the Washington Federalist_.\r\n\r\n2. Portions of the letters to and from Colonel Burr are interesting;\r\nmany highly amusing; but the space yet remaining in which these\r\nmemoirs are to be closed renders it absolutely necessary to exclude\r\nthem from the work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n\r\nA separation of the South American provinces from the government of\r\nSpain had long been anticipated. As early as the year 1796, while John\r\nJay was governor, Colonel Burr had various conversations with him on\r\nthe subject of these provinces. In these conversations Colonel Burr\r\nexpressed his views in reference to South America, which, he said, he\r\ncould revolutionize and take possession of. Governor Jay replied that\r\nthe boldness of the project would contribute to its success;\r\nexpressing his opinion that it was not impracticable. From this period\r\nuntil 1805, Mr. Burr's mind seemed to have been constantly engaged in\r\nreflecting on the feasibility of the measure, and the proper period\r\nfor carrying it into operation.\r\n\r\nAs matter of history connected with this subject, but not generally\r\nknown, it may not be improper to refer to an occurrence as early as\r\nthe year 1797, 98. About this period General Miranda was in the United\r\nStates. He formed an acquaintance with Generals Hamilton, Knox, and\r\nother distinguished Americans. To these gentlemen he communicated his\r\nproject of revolutionizing South America. From the United States he\r\nproceeded to England, and presented himself to the British ministry.\r\nThey entered into his views. The proposition was, that the United\r\nStates should furnish ten thousand troops, and, in that event, the\r\nBritish government agreed to supply the necessary funds and ships to\r\ncarry on an expedition. As soon as Miranda had completed his\r\narrangements with the British minister, he addressed a letter to\r\nGeneral Alexander Hamilton, dated April 6th, 1798, in which he\r\nsays:----\r\n\r\n\"This, my dear and respectable friend, will be handed to you by my\r\ncountryman Don -----, who is charged with despatches of the highest\r\nimportance for the President of the United States. He will tell you,\r\n_confidentially_, all that you wish to know on this subject. It\r\nappears that the moment of our emancipation approaches, and the\r\nestablishment of liberty on all the continent of the New World is\r\nconfided by Providence to us. The only danger which I foresee is the\r\nintroduction of French principles, which would poison our liberty in\r\nits cradle, and would finish by destroying yours.\"\r\n\r\nSo far did these arrangements advance, that Miranda again wrote\r\nGeneral Hamilton, under date of the 19th of October, 1798:----\r\n\r\n\"Your wishes are, in some sort, already accomplished, seeing that it\r\nhas been agreed here on one side not to employ in the operations on\r\nland English troops; seeing that the auxiliary land forces are to be\r\nexclusively American, while the naval force shall be purely English.\r\nEvery thing is smooth, and we wait only for the fiat of your\r\nillustrious president to depart like lightning.\"\r\n\r\nOn the same day (October 19th) General Miranda wrote General Knox as\r\nfollows:----\r\n\r\n\"I cannot express to you, my dear general, with what pleasure I heard\r\nof your nomination [1] in the continental army of the United States of\r\nAmerica. It would appear that your _wishes_ are at length\r\n_accomplished_, and that every possible circumstance is united, at\r\nthis moment, in our favour. Would to God that Providence would endow\r\nus with sufficient wisdom to make the most advantageous use of these\r\ncircumstances.\"\r\n\r\nAt this time Mr. Adams, senior, was president of the United States,\r\nand declined entering into the arrangement. It is believed that no\r\nreply was made to the letter addressed to the president. Two questions\r\nhere present themselves to the inquiring mind.\r\n\r\nWas there any connexion between this plan of Miranda for the invasion\r\nof Mexico, and the raising of an army in the year 1798, under the\r\npretext of resisting an attack upon this country by France?\r\n\r\nWas the policy adopted by President Adams on that occasion any way\r\nconnected with the imbittered warfare which subsequently ensued\r\nbetween Mr. Adams and Mr. Hamilton? These are questions for the\r\nconsideration of speculative politicians, but not for discussion in\r\nthis place.\r\n\r\nIt has been seen that Mr. Burr was actively engaged during the years\r\n1805 and 1806 in traversing the western country. In his latter days\r\nColonel Burr had no longer any motive for concealment; nor did he\r\nevince the least desire to suppress the facts in relation to any of\r\nhis acts, even where the promulgation of those facts was calculated to\r\naffect his moral character. According to his representations, repeated\r\nat a time and under circumstances the most solemn [2] and impressive,\r\nhis views were twofold: viz., _First_. The revolutionizing of Mexico;\r\nand, _Second_, A settlement on what was known as the Bastrop lands.\r\nBurr, from early manhood, had a turn for speculation, and frequently\r\nentered into large contracts for the purchase and sale of lands.\r\n\r\nAt this period (1806) the difficulties with Spain in relation to the\r\nMississippi and the right of deposite at New-Orleans created an\r\nopinion that a Spanish war was inevitable. Such a war would have been\r\npopular with the western people. Of these opinions and these feelings\r\nBurr took advantage, and undoubtedly, by innuendoes or otherwise,\r\ninduced some to believe that his arrangements for the invasion of\r\nMexico were with the knowledge, if not the approbation of the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the cession of Louisiana to the United States, Baron P.N.\r\nTut Bastrop contracted with the Spanish government for a tract of land\r\nexceeding thirty miles square near Nachitoches. By the terms of the\r\ncontract he was, within a given period of time, to settle upon these\r\nlands two hundred families. Subsequently Colonel Charles Lynch made an\r\narrangement with Bastrop for an interest in this contract. Burr\r\npurchased from Lynch nearly four hundred thousand acres, and\r\nNachitoches. On the trial at Richmond this purchase was established,\r\nand the actual payment to Lynch by Burr of five thousand dollars was\r\nalso proved.\r\n\r\nGeneral Adair possessed the confidence of Colonel Burr in relation to\r\nhis western movements in a greater degree than any other individual.\r\nBurr was introduced to Adair by General Wilkinson. In a letter dated\r\nMarch, 1807, General Adair says, and there is no doubt truly says--\"So\r\nfar as I know or believe of the intentions of Colonel Burr (and my\r\nenemies will agree I am not ignorant on this subject), they were to\r\nprepare and lead an expedition into Mexico, predicated on a war\r\nbetween the two governments; without a war he knew he could do\r\nnothing. On this war taking place he calculated with certainty, as\r\nwell from the policy of the measure at this time as from the positive\r\nassurances of Wilkinson, who seemed to have the power to force it in\r\nhis own hands. This continued to be the object of Colonel Burr until\r\nhe heard of the venal and shameful bargain made by Wilkinson at the\r\nSabine river; this information he received soon after the attempt to\r\narrest him in Frankfort. He then turned his attention altogether\r\ntowards strengthening himself on the Washita, and waiting a more\r\nfavourable crisis. I thought the first of these objects honourable and\r\nworthy the attention of any man; but I was not engaged in it, my\r\npolitical as well as private pursuits forbidding me from taking a part\r\nuntil it was over; nor did I ever believe, notwithstanding Wilkinson's\r\nswaggering letters to me on that subject, which may be seen, that a\r\nwar would take place.\"\r\n\r\nThe grant of the Spanish government to Bastrop amounted to 1,200,000\r\nacres. Six tenths of this grant was conveyed to Colonel Lynch, and cost\r\nhim about one hundred thousand dollars. As the time within which two\r\nhundred families were to be settled on the land was rapidly drawing to a\r\nclose, Lynch conveyed one half his right to Burr for fifty thousand\r\ndollars. In this purchase many private citizens of worth and\r\nrespectability were interested. The two projects, however, became in\r\nsome degree blended. The great object of Burr was the conquest of\r\nMexico. With this view he conferred with General Wilkinson, who was\r\nardent in the cause. Wilkinson's regular force, about six hundred men,\r\nwas intended as a nucleus, around which the followers of Burr were to\r\nform. They were the only disciplined corps that could be expected. As\r\nWilkinson was the American commander-in-chief, and stationed upon the\r\nborders of Mexico, he possessed the power, and was pledged to strike the\r\nblow whenever it should be deemed expedient. This commencement of the\r\nwar would thus have been apparently under the sanction and authority of\r\nthe American government, and would have drawn to the standard of Burr\r\nnumerous volunteers from the western states. Such, undoubtedly, was the\r\nplan; and Burr entertained no suspicion of Wilkinson's treachery towards\r\nhim until his interview with Swartwout. As soon as he made that\r\ndiscovery, in the language of General Adair, \"he turned his attention\r\ntowards strengthening himself on the Washita, and waiting a more\r\nfavourable crisis.\"\r\n\r\nDaniel Clarke, of New-Orleans, entered into the Mexican project. He\r\nengaged to advance fifty thousand dollars; but subsequently, from\r\ndisappointments, he was unable to fulfil his contract. General\r\nWilkinson detailed to Colonel Burr all the information he possessed\r\nrespecting that country, and pointed out the facilities which would\r\nprobably be afforded by the inhabitants in effecting a revolution.\r\nWithout Wilkinson's troops, Burr declared most solemnly, a short time\r\nbefore his death, that he would not have made the attempt on Mexico;\r\nthat he was perfectly aware the men he would collect, so far as it\r\nrespected military operations, would be at first little better than a\r\nmob.\r\n\r\nColonel Burr had repeated conferences on the subject with Mr. Merry,\r\nthe British plenipotentiary resident in the United States. Mr. Merry\r\ncommunicated to his government the project of Mr. Burr. Colonel\r\nCharles Williamson, the brother of Lord Balgray, went to England on\r\nthe business, and, from the encouragement which he received, it was\r\nhoped and believed that a British naval squadron would have been\r\nfurnished in aid of the expedition. At this juncture Mr. Pitt died.\r\nWilkinson must have heard of the death of the premier late in the\r\nspring or early in the summer of 1806. From this moment, in Mr. Burr's\r\nopinion, Wilkinson became alarmed, and resolved on an abandonment of\r\nthe enterprise at the sacrifice of his associates.\r\n\r\nOn the suggestion of Wilkinson, Mexico was twice visited by Daniel\r\nClark. He held conferences and effected arrangements with many of the\r\nprincipal militia officers, who engaged to favour the revolution. The\r\nCatholic bishop, resident at New-Orleans, was also consulted, and\r\nprepared to promote the enterprise. He designated three priests, of\r\nthe order of Jesuits, as suitable agents, and they were accordingly\r\nemployed. The bishop was an intelligent and social man. He had been in\r\nMexico, and spoke with great freedom of the dissatisfaction of the\r\nclergy in South America. The religious establishments of the country\r\nwere not to be molested. Madame Xavier Tarjcon, superior of the\r\nconvent of Ursuline nuns at New-Orleans, was in the secret. Some of\r\nthe sisterhood were also employed in Mexico. So far as any decision\r\nhad been formed, the landing was to have been effected at Tampico.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1806 Colonel Burr was at the house of General Andrew\r\nJackson for some days. Repeated and detailed conversations were held\r\nbetween them in relation to the expedition. Subsequently, General\r\nJackson addressed a letter to Colonel Burr, in which he alluded to\r\nrumours that were afloat of his having hostile designs against the\r\nUnited States; adding that, if this were true, he would hold no\r\ncommunication on the subject; but, if untrue, and his intentions were\r\nto proceed to Mexico, he (Jackson) would join and accompany him with\r\nhis whole division. To this the proper answer was given.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time Colonel Burr wrote Senator John Smith, of Ohio, on\r\nthe subject of these rumours, in which letter he says--\"If Bonaparte,\r\nwith all his army, was in the western country for the purpose of\r\naccomplishing that object, they would never again see salt water.\" It\r\nmay be proper to state here that Colonel Burr's whole force at no time\r\nexceeded _one hundred and thirty men_.\r\n\r\nThis is a brief, but it is believed to be a true and faithful account\r\nof Colonel Burr's views and projects during the years 1805 and 1806.\r\nIn the progress of these transactions many individuals were\r\nimplicated. While the promulgation of their names might tend to\r\ngratify an idle curiosity, it could be productive of no possible good.\r\n(The charge of treason, now that the storm has blown over, is so\r\nperfectly ridiculous, that one who investigates the subject will be\r\nastounded that it ever gained credence. It originated with the most\r\ncorrupt and unprincipled, and was countenanced, propagated, and\r\nsustained by the most malignant.) When the charge of treason was first\r\nspread abroad, Colonel Burr appeared to be deserted and abandoned by\r\nhis confidential and devoted friends. Even his son-in-law, Governor\r\nAlston, seemed to shrink from the consequences of an intercourse with\r\nhim. All those who were in any manner connected with the contemplated\r\nexpedition disclaimed the idea of treasonable designs, averring that,\r\nif such were the views of Colonel Burr, they had been deceived. And\r\nwhat does all this prove? Does it not demonstrate that if his object\r\nwas a separation of the Union, that object was to be accomplished\r\nwithout the knowledge or aid of his friends and associates? Can any\r\nthing place the charge in a more ridiculous point of view?\r\n\r\nColonel Burr was arrested as a traitor on the Tombigbee river,\r\nMississippi territory, and transported to Richmond, where he arrived\r\non the 26th of March, 1807. He was bailed until the 22d of May, when\r\nthe court was to convene. A description of the outrages and cruelty\r\nwhich he endured would fill volumes. A calm and dispassionate detail\r\nof the means which were adopted by Mr. Jefferson to obtain an\r\nopportunity of shedding his blood, under colour of law, would be\r\nrevolting to the philanthropist and the patriot, while it would not\r\nchange public opinion of this philosopher.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1806, Mr. Swartwout delivered to General Wilkinson a\r\nletter from Burr, written in cipher. That letter Wilkinson _altered_,\r\nand then deciphered it. The forgery was detected before the grand\r\njury, and he compelled to acknowledge the fact, although he had sworn\r\nto the translation as being correct in all its parts. Notwithstanding\r\nMr. Jefferson's knowledge that Wilkinson was a Spanish pensioner,\r\nwhich fact Mr. Derbigny had stated to Secretary Gallatin in a letter,\r\nand subsequently swore to its truth; and notwithstanding his perjury\r\nbefore the grand jury, yet did the president sustain and countenance\r\nthe general as a fit instrument for his purposes.\r\n\r\nOther arrests were made during this military reign of terror, _viz._,\r\nGenerals Adair and Dayton, Blennerhassett, Swartwout, Alexander,\r\nSmith, Bollman, Ogden, &c. Burr and Blennerhasset alone were brought\r\nto trial. On the 22d of May, 1807, came on the cause of Aaron Burr\r\nbefore the Circuit Court of the United States, Judge Marshall\r\npresiding. No indictment was found by the grand jury until the 25th of\r\nJune, when two bills were presented against Burr; one for treason, and\r\nthe other for a misdemeanour. On the 30th of June he was committed to\r\nthe penitentiary for safe keeping until the third day of August. From\r\nthe 5th until the 17th of August the court was engaged in obtaining a\r\njury and discussing points of law. On that day the treason case was\r\nopened, and an examination of witnesses on the part of the government\r\ncommenced. Colonel Burr had more than thirty witnesses in attendance,\r\nbut deemed it unnecessary to call any of them.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st day of September, 1807, the jury retired, and in a short\r\ntime returned with the following verdict, which was read by Colonel\r\nCarrington, their foreman.\r\n\r\n\"We of the jury say that Aaron Burr is not proved to be guilty under\r\nthis indictment by any evidence submitted to us. We therefore find him\r\nnot guilty.\"\r\n\r\nThis verdict was objected to by Colonel Burr as informal. He observed\r\nthat, whenever a verdict is informal, the court will either send back\r\nthe jury to alter it, or correct it itself; that they had no right to\r\ndepart from the usual form, &c. Mr. Hay thought the verdict ought to\r\nbe recorded as found by the jury, which was substantially a verdict of\r\nacquittal; and that no principle of humanity, policy, or law forbade\r\nits being received in the very terms used by the jury.\r\n\r\nMr. Martin said that it was like the _whole play_, \"Much ado about\r\nNothing;\" that this was a verdict of acquittal; that there was nothing\r\nto do but to answer the question of guilty or not guilty; that it was\r\nthe case with every jury in every instance; they had or had not\r\nevidence before them.\r\n\r\nColonel Carrington, one of the jury, observed, that it was said among\r\nthemselves that, if the verdict was informal, they would alter it;\r\nthat it was, in fact, a verdict of acquittal.\r\n\r\nThe court then directed that the verdict should remain as found by the\r\njury; and that an entry should be made on the record of \"_Not\r\nGuilty_.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of September a jury was empannelled to try Colonel Burr on\r\nthe indictment for misdemeanour, which consisted of seven counts; the\r\nsubstance of which were, that Aaron Burr did set on foot a military\r\nenterprise, to be carried on against the territory of a foreign\r\nprince; _viz._, the province of Mexico, which was within the territory\r\nof the King of Spain, with whom the United States were at peace.\r\n\r\nAfter the prosecution had examined some of their witnesses, and the\r\ncourt had decided that the testimony of others was not relevant, the\r\ndistrict attorney, Mr. Hay, made a motion that the jury be discharged.\r\nTo this motion Colonel Burr objected, insisting upon a verdict. This\r\nwas on the 15th of September. The court being of opinion that the jury\r\ncould not in this stage of the case be discharged without the consent\r\nof the accused, and that they must give a verdict, they accordingly\r\nretired, and very soon returned with a verdict of \"_Not Guilty_.\"\r\n\r\nPrevious to the trial for treason it was industriously circulated that\r\nCommodore Truxton had most honourably repelled Colonel Burr's\r\nadvances, and pointed out the infamy which awaited him. He was\r\nsubpoenaed on the part of the United States, and on his examination\r\nsaid--\"That Colonel Burr told him (some time in July, 1806) that he\r\ncontemplated an expedition to Mexico in the event of a war with Spain,\r\nwhich he thought inevitable. He asked me if the Havannah could be\r\neasily taken in the event of a war. I told him that it would require\r\nthe co-operation of a naval force. Mr. Burr observed to me that _that_\r\nmight be obtained. He asked me if I had any personal knowledge of\r\nCarthagena and La Vera Cruz, and what would be the best mode of\r\nattacking them by sea and land. I gave him my opinion very freely. Mr.\r\nBurr then asked me if I would take the command of a naval expedition.\r\nI asked him if the executive of the United States were privy to or\r\nconcerned in the project. He answered _emphatically_ that he was not:\r\nI asked that question because the executive had been charged with a\r\nknowledge of Miranda's expedition. I told Mr. Burr that I would have\r\nnothing to do with it; that Miranda's project had been intimated to\r\nme, but I declined to have any thing to do with such affairs. He\r\nobserved to me that, in the event of a war, he intended to establish\r\nan independent government in Mexico; that Wilkinson, the army, and\r\nmany officers of the navy would join. I told Mr. Burr that I could not\r\nsee how any officer of the United States could join. He said that\r\nGeneral Wilkinson had projected the expedition, and he had matured it;\r\nthat many greater men than Wilkinson would join, and that thousands to\r\nthe westward would join. I told Colonel Burr that there would be no\r\nwar. He was sanguine there would be war. He said, however, that if he\r\nwas disappointed as to the event of a war, he was about to complete a\r\ncontract for a large quantity of land on the Washita; that he intended\r\nto invite his friends to settle it; that in one year he would have a\r\nthousand families of respectable and fashionable people, and some of\r\nthem of considerable property; that it was a fine country, and that\r\nthey would have a charming society, and in two years he would have\r\ndouble the number of settlers; and, being on the frontier, he would be\r\nready to move whenever a war took place.\"\r\n\r\nOn his cross examination Commodore Truxton added \"that he was very\r\nintimate with Colonel Burr; that in their conversations there appeared\r\nto be no reserve; that he never heard Colonel Burr speak of a division\r\nof the Union; that Burr said his Mexican expedition would be\r\nbeneficial to the United States; that, so far from doubting Burr's\r\nintention to settle the Washita lands, he was astonished at hearing he\r\nhad different views, which accounts were contained in newspapers\r\nreceived from the western country.\"\r\n\r\nFrom among numerous instances of Mr. Jefferson's idea of _honour_ and\r\n_morality_, as practised by him and by his order pending that trial,\r\nonly one will be selected as a _sample_. Dr. Erick Bollman, the friend\r\nof Lafayette, was arrested by the order of Wilkinson as a\r\nco-conspirator with Burr. He was called as a witness on the part of\r\nthe United States; and in open court, the district attorney, Mr. Hay,\r\nby order of Mr. Jefferson, tendered him a pardon, which he indignantly\r\nrefused, asserting his innocence of any act requiring a pardon.\r\nImmediately after the trial, he published, under his own signature, an\r\naccount of what occurred between himself and the president. From that\r\npublication, which was never controverted, sufficient will be\r\nextracted to show Mr. Jefferson's _feelings_ and _principles_.\r\n\r\nBollman says, \"In the month of December, 1806, I was seized and\r\narrested at New-Orleans by order of General Wilkinson, but in the name\r\nof the United States. When I arrived at Charleston, Annapolis, and\r\nWashington, the newspapers represented Colonel Burr as being at the\r\nhead of two thousand men, and they were ringing at the same time with\r\nreports of his _pretended treason._\r\n\r\n\"These circumstances occasioned in my mind great indignation with\r\nregard to the reports just mentioned, and great solicitude lest\r\nGeneral Wilkinson's conduct and Burr's situation might lead to\r\noccurrences which Colonel Burr would deprecate, and which\r\ninvoluntarily would put him in the wrong.\r\n\r\n\"I therefore requested an interview with the president of the United\r\nStates for two decided objects. 1st, To remove from his mind the false\r\nimpressions he had received with regard to treason. 2d, To endeavour\r\nto convince him that the interests of the United States would be best\r\nconsulted by going to war with Spain, and giving countenance to the\r\nexpedition which Colonel Burr had planned.\r\n\r\n\"It appeared to me that this step might do some good, could do no\r\nharm, and, in my situation, ought to be attempted. I saw the\r\npresident, together with Mr. Madison; and having first, when\r\nquestioned on that point, declared to the former that I had no\r\n_personal motives_ for this interview, spoke to them to the effect\r\njust mentioned. The day after the interview I received the following\r\nnote from the president, the original of which, in _his own\r\nhandwriting_, now remains in my possession:--\r\n\r\n\"'The communications which Doctor Bollman made yesterday to Thomas\r\nJefferson were certainly interesting; but they were too much for his\r\nmemory. From _their complexion and tendency_, he presumes that Doctor\r\nBollman would have no objection to commit them to writing, in all the\r\ndetails into which he went yesterday, and such others as he may have\r\nthen omitted, Thomas Jefferson giving him _his word of honour_ that\r\nthey shall never be used against himself, and _that the paper shall\r\nnever go out of his hand_.'\r\n\r\nJanuary 25, 1807.\r\n\r\n\"I immediately complied with the president's request; and considering\r\nthe communication, in conformity with the tenour of his note, _as\r\nstrictly confidential_, I had no motive to be unusually guarded, or to\r\nweigh every expression with more than ordinary care. The paper,\r\ncontaining nearly twenty pages, was hardly finished, when I\r\nimmediately sent it to the president. I borrowed it from him some time\r\nafterward when in prison, in order to take a copy, and then returned\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"The whole of it goes to the two points above mentioned, _viz_., to\r\ndisprove treason, and to show the expediency of war. It can give no\r\nother ideas to an unbiased reader, unless one or two expressions,\r\nimproperly used, and for which the allowance ought to be made, that\r\nthe English is not my native tongue, are singled out, are considered\r\ndisconnectedly with what precedes and follows, and construed in a\r\nhostile manner.\r\n\r\n\"The president had given _'his word of honour'_ that this paper should\r\nnot be used against myself; and yet _on it_ was predicated the\r\npretended necessity of a _pardon_ for my personal safety. The attorney\r\nfor the district (Mr. Hay), in open court, when offering me the patent\r\npardon, referred to it. Nay, when I indignantly refused that pardon,\r\nhe reminded me of the _horrors of an ignominious fate_, in order, if\r\npossible, to change my determination. Is a paper not used against me\r\nwhen, on account of its contents being misunderstood, I am thus\r\nassailed with the _tender of a badge of infamy?_ Is _life_, in Mr.\r\nJefferson's opinion, _all_; and _character_ and _reputation_, which\r\nalone can render it desirable, _nothing_? The great inquest of the\r\nnation, after hearing a great variety of testimony, and particularly\r\nthat of General Wilkinson, _by an opinion nearly unanimous on my\r\nsubject, have absolved me from guilt!_ No indictment has been\r\npreferred against me, though they have indicted various gentlemen in\r\ndifferent parts of the United States. Was it, then, becoming the first\r\nmagistrate of the Union, whom I had approached with some degree of\r\nconfidence, and with regard to whom neither my conduct nor my language\r\nhave ever been unfriendly--was it becoming in _him_, in a measure, to\r\nforestall the opinion of the grand jury, and to stigmatize me as a\r\npardoned criminal?\r\n\r\n\"The paper was never to get out of the president's hands, but it is\r\n_now_ in the hands of the attorney for the Virginia district. On the\r\n23d of June, an occurrence of which the prints have taken no notice,\r\nthe grand jury came into court. Their foreman stated that one of the\r\nwitnesses had mentioned to him an important paper, written by another\r\nwitness, which was in the possession of Mr. Hay, and of which they\r\nwished the delivery. Mr. Hay replied, that this referred to my letter\r\nto the president, which was in his possession, but that he did not\r\nconsider himself warranted to give it to the grand jury. He also\r\ndeclared it to be his firm persuasion that the paper was written in my\r\nown handwriting; it has further appeared that he had occasioned\r\nGeneral Wilkinson to read it. Through him he had brought what is\r\nfalsely stated to be its contents insidiously before the grand jury.\r\nGeneral Wilkinson, when before that body, and, of course, on his oath,\r\ndid assert that he knew the paper in Mr. Hay's hands; that it was my\r\nhandwriting and my signature.\r\n\r\n\"The history of the proposed pardon will have flown over Europe, and\r\nthe impression of treachery to a friend--this more detestable, more\r\nodious crime than any infraction of the laws of the country, because\r\nessentially fraught with turpitude, will be blended with my name in\r\nthe minds of men who may never see _this_ letter. And if all this\r\ninjury could be inflicted by Mr. Jefferson without _ill will_, merely\r\nfrom want of consideration, under the disturbing influence of _passion\r\nand resentment against Colonel Burr_, notwithstanding his mature age\r\nand the dignity of his station, it will amount to strong proof, at\r\nleast, that I, in my humble sphere and with a more youthful\r\nimagination, may have become warmed with the beautiful prospect of the\r\nemancipation of an enslaved kingdom; a project which Mr. Jefferson\r\nhimself approved of and connived at when planned, not by Colonel Burr,\r\nbut by Miranda; and that I may have engaged in it without meaning any\r\nharm to the United States or their president.\r\n\r\n\"But since the measure of the pardon has proved abortive and\r\nridiculous, and since the fact of his breach of the '_word of honour_'\r\ncan no longer be denied, their tone is changed. As usual, I am abused,\r\nnot for the wrong I did, but for the wrong which has been committed\r\nupon me. They insinuate, among other things, that at Washington I had\r\n_obtained promises_ from Mr. Jefferson, and had _agreed_ with him, for\r\na pardon; that I refused it at Richmond, in order to have a pretext\r\nfor withholding testimony, on the ground that it would criminate\r\nmyself, though it is well known that such promise, such agreement\r\nnever took place; and that before the grand jury, during an\r\nexamination of upward of two hours, I answered, _without a single\r\nexception, every question that was asked me_.\r\n\r\n\"When party spirit and passion go so far, it would be improper to\r\nremain silent; and should what I have said in my defence operate to\r\nthe prejudice of Mr. Jefferson or wound his feelings, it is not my\r\nfault.\r\n\r\n\"ERICK BOLLMAN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n1. In July, 1798, Generals Hamilton, Pinckney, and Knox were appointed\r\nmajor generals in the standing army raised that summer, _nominally_,\r\nfor the purpose of repelling a French invasion, at a moment when\r\nFrance had not a ship of war on the ocean, and while British squadrons\r\nwere hovering on her whole coast.\r\n\r\n2. On the 10th of June, 1835, Dr. Hosack, the friend and physician of\r\nColonel Burr, supposed that he could not continue but a few days,\r\nperhaps a few hours. Mr. Burr was so informed, and was then asked by\r\nM.L. Davis whether at any time he had contemplated a separation of the\r\nUnion. His reply was--\"No; I would as soon have thought of taking\r\npossession of the moon, and informing my friends that I intended to\r\ndivide it among them.\" While making the reply his indignation seemed\r\nto be aroused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe excitement produced by Mr. Jefferson, Mr. Eaton, and Mr. Wilkinson\r\nin relation to Burr's movements, exceeded any thing that can be well\r\nimagined. That grave and dignified body, the Senate of the United\r\nStates, were _terrified_, or they were _used_ for the purpose of\r\n_terrifying_ the good people of the country. On the 22d of January,\r\n1807, Mr. Jefferson sent a message to Congress developing the\r\ntreasonable designs of Burr and his associates. On the 26th, with the\r\naid of General Wilkinson, a second message was transmitted on the same\r\nsubject; and, by _accident_, about the same time that this message of\r\nthe president was received by the House of Representatives, that\r\nhonourable body received a message from the Senate also, announcing\r\nthat they had passed a \"_bill for suspending the writ of habeas\r\ncorpus_,\" and asking the concurrence of the house. This was carrying\r\nthe _farce_ too far, and a motion was therefore made and adopted to\r\nreject the bill on its _first reading_. Ayes 113; nays 19. Thus the\r\nbill was rejected.\r\n\r\nDuring the years 1806 and 1807 Herman Blennerhassett kept a private\r\njournal, in which are recorded the principal incidents arising out of\r\nhis connexion with Colonel Burr. Portions of it are interesting and\r\namusing. The entries confirm in every particular the statements of\r\nTruxton, Bollman, and others, and repudiate the idea of treasonable\r\ndesigns. That journal, having been transmitted from England, is before\r\nme. From it a few brief extracts will be made. It appears that in\r\nDecember, 1805, Blennerhassett addressed a letter to Colonel Burr,\r\nexpressing a wish to participate in any speculation in the western\r\ncountry that might present itself to Burr. A Spanish war was hourly\r\nanticipated, and Blennerhassett proposed to join Burr in any\r\nexpedition that might be undertaken against the Spainish dominions.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1806, in consequence of this overture, Burr visited\r\nBlennerhassett at his house on the Ohio, and the next day rode with\r\nhim to Marietta, and there they separated, Burr being on his way to\r\nChilicothe. From Marietta to Blennerhassett's was about fifteen miles.\r\nSome time after Burr returned to Blennerhassett's. Burr said that an\r\nexpulsion of the Spaniards from the American territory or an invasion\r\nof Mexico would be pleasing to the administration; if it could be\r\naccomplished without an open formal war, which would be avoided as\r\nlong as possible, from parsimony on the one hand and the dread of\r\nFrance on the other.\r\n\r\nBlennerhassett tendered his services to Burr generally. Blennerhassett\r\nstates that General Jackson and others were to join, and that the\r\ngeneral was in readiness to march whenever he should think himself\r\nauthorized by the position of the government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACTS.\r\n\r\n\"The vivacity of Burr's wit, and the exercise of his proper talents,\r\nnow (at Richmond) constantly solicited here, in private and public\r\nexhibition, while they display his powers and address at the levee and\r\nthe bar, must engross more of his time than he can spare from the\r\ndemands of other gratifications; while they display him to the eager\r\neyes of the multitude, like a favourite gladiator, measuring over the\r\narena of his fame with firm step and manly grace, the pledges of easy\r\nvictory.\"\r\n\r\n\"August 17, 1807. This led me to praise a pamphlet, _Agrestis_, which\r\nAlston yesterday brought me, being two letters on Wilkinson's\r\nproceedings at New-Orleans, which, for its arrangement and strength,\r\nas well as for the imagery of the language, I observed would not be\r\nunworthy of a Curran; at the same time inquiring who was the author.\r\nAlston said that was not known. I then repeated the question to\r\nColonel M'Kee, who said it was a friend of ours; at least, Mr. Alston\r\nwas suspected. I mention this trifling occurrence for the sake of\r\nobserving that Alston was now silent, thereby appropriating to himself\r\nthe merit of the book, which his _wife_, I have no doubt, might\r\nproduce. To suppose Alston [1] the author would be preposterous.\"\r\n\r\n\"August 23, 1807. My revery was soon broken in upon by the appearance\r\nof Mr. Douglas with a stranger. I should rather have said by two\r\napparitions; for it was now near nightfall, and Douglas no sooner\r\nappeared than he turned on his heel, saying, 'Colonel Duane, sir,' and\r\nran down stairs. The surprise of this interruption the stranger, whom\r\nI had never before seen, did not suffer to endure long enough to allow\r\nme to invoke the angels and ministers of grace for my protection. I\r\nwas already within the grasp of this Gabriel of the government. He\r\nseized my hand, and bade me dismiss my surprise, however natural it\r\nmight be, on his appearance before me. I handed him a chair, and said\r\n'I had lived long enough in this country to be surprised at nothing it\r\ncould produce or exhibit, but yet desired to learn from what cause I\r\nhad the favour of this visit.' 'Having heard Mr. Douglas observe,'\r\nsaid he, 'that you would be pleased to see me--' 'Sir, Mr. Douglas has\r\nmade a mistake; he must have meant somebody else.' 'No matter,'\r\ncontinued he; 'having known and seen your present situation, I could\r\nnot as a man, as an Irishman' (here he digressed to show me how he\r\nboth was and was not an Irishman), 'I would not leave this town\r\n(Richmond) without warning you of the sacrifice now preparing to\r\nappease the government by your friends, of which you are destined to\r\nbe the victim. You cannot desire any other key to my meaning than the\r\ncourse the defence has this week taken. But if you think the\r\ngovernment will not cease to pursue that justice they possess the\r\nmeans of ensuring, and suspect, as you ought, the designs of those you\r\nhave too long thought your friends, it might yet appear no better on\r\nmy part than a nominal service to give you these cautions: I have\r\ntherefore sought you, not to tender you words, but deeds. The only\r\nreturn on your part will be that care of yourself which will find a\r\nshield in _my honour_' (here he very awkwardly struck his breast, and\r\ngrinned a ghastly smile), 'and that confidence I can _command_ in the\r\ngovernment whose good faith is not misplaced in the zeal I have\r\ntestified to serve it.' To this harangue he added violent\r\nprotestations of his wishes to serve me, saying, that for that purpose\r\nhe would put off his journey back to Philadelphia, which otherwise was\r\nirrevocably fixed for Wednesday, and would now, or at any time\r\nhereafter, go to Washington for me, where _nothing he should ask would\r\nbe refused him_. In thanking him for the frankness and zeal with which\r\nhe cautioned me against my friends and a negligence of my safety, I\r\nassured him I was not afraid to meet the prosecution, as I expected I\r\nshould before my arrival here, without counsel or friends; but, from\r\npresent appearances, I was more curious than interested to learn what\r\nwere those means the said government possessed of ensuring justice.\r\nFinding by his answer that he was now disposed to allure me into a\r\nconfession of having written certain papers in the hands of the\r\nprosecutors, I told him, the warmth of his offers to serve me could\r\nnot make me forget either his situation or my own with relation to the\r\ngovernment; that I cared not what writings should be charged upon me;\r\nthat I should admit none till fairly proved, which, if any such should\r\never appear, I would justify, if necessary, on the scaffold. He now\r\nsummed up the objects of his mission, whatever produced it, with abuse\r\nof Burr, Tyler, and Smith, _acknowledging that he had been served\r\ngratis by Burr in the most handsome manner_; that the others were more\r\nconcerned against the government than I was; but swearing that he\r\nbelieved, if I did not follow his advice, they would make a scapegoat\r\nsacrifice of me for their deliverance.\"\r\n\r\n\"August 25, 1807. I asked Alston, 'Would you wish to see my notes of\r\nwhat passed between Duane and me?' 'Yes,' said he, 'very much.' I then\r\nread to him the minutes I had taken on Sunday evening, with which he\r\nseemed highly pleased, and said they ought to be published. To this I\r\ntold him I could not accede. * * * * * * I informed him that Duane had\r\nintimated that government had got possession of one of his letters to\r\nme. 'One of my letters,' cried he; 'I never wrote to you but two upon\r\nbusiness of a private nature; and, by G--d, any other letter they can\r\nhave of mine must be a forgery.' 'To be sure,' said I; 'or, at all\r\nevents, from the favourable course things are now likely to take, such\r\na letter could do no harm.' 'But what did the rascal,' continued he,\r\n'state to be the purport of the letter?' 'Nothing more,' said I, 'than\r\nthat you and myself were equally involved in all Colonel Burr's\r\nprojects. He then abused Duane, and repeated his wish that my notes\r\nwere published.\"\r\n\r\n\"September 13, 1807. I visited Burr this morning. He is as gay as\r\nusual, and as busy in speculations on reorganizing his projects for\r\naction as if he had never suffered the least interruption. He observed\r\nto Major Smith and me, that in six months our schemes could be all\r\nremounted; that we could now new model them in a better mould than\r\nformerly, having a better view of the ground and a more perfect\r\nknowledge of our men. We were silent. It should yet be granted, that\r\nif Burr possessed sensibility of the right sort, with one hundredth\r\npart of the energies for which, with many, he has obtained such\r\nill-grounded credit, his first and last determination, with the\r\nmorning and the night, should be the destruction of those enemies who\r\nhave so long and so cruelly wreaked their malicious vengeance upon\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"September 16, 1807. I was glad to find Burr had at last thought of\r\nasking us to dine with him, as I was rather curious again to see him\r\nshine in a _partie quarrie_, consisting of new characters. We\r\ntherefore walked with him from court; Luther Martin, who lives with\r\nhim, accompanying us. * * * * * The dinner was neat, and followed by\r\nthree or four sorts of wine. Splendid poverty! During the chit-chat,\r\nafter the cloth was removed, a letter was handed to Burr, next to whom\r\nI sat. I immediately smelt musk. Burr broke the seal, put the cover to\r\nhis nose, and then handed it to me, saying--'This amounts to a\r\ndisclosure!' I smelt the paper, and said, 'I think so.' The whole\r\nphysiognomy of the man now assumed an alteration and vivacity that, to\r\na stranger who had never seen him before, would have sunk full fifteen\r\nyears of his age. 'This,' said he, 'reminds me of a detection once\r\nvery neatly practised upon me at New-York. One day a lady stepped into\r\nmy library while I was reading, came softly behind my chair, and\r\ngiving me a slap on the cheek, said, \"Come, tell me directly, what\r\nlittle French girl, pray, have you had here?\" The abruptness of the\r\nquestion and surprise left me little room to doubt the discovery had\r\nbeen completely made. So I thought it best to confess the whole fact;\r\nupon which the inquisitress burst out into a loud laugh on the success\r\nof her artifice, which she was led to play off upon me from the mere\r\ncircumstance of, having smelt musk in the room.' I have given this\r\nanecdote a place here only to convey an idea of that temperament and\r\naddress which enables this character to uphold his ascendèncy over the\r\nsex. After some time Martin and Prevost withdrew, and we passed to the\r\ntopics of our late adventures on the Mississippi, in which Burr said\r\nlittle, but declared he did not know of any reason to blame General\r\nJackson, of Tennessee, for any thing he had done or omitted. But he\r\ndeclares he will not lose a day after the favourable issue at the\r\nCapitol (his acquittal), of which he has no doubt, to direct his\r\nentire attention to setting up his projects (which have only been\r\nsuspended) on a better model, 'in which work,' he says, 'he has even\r\nhere made some progress.'\"\r\n\r\n\"September 20, 1807. I found Burr, just after a consultation with his\r\ncounsel, secretly writhing under much irritation at the conduct of\r\nJudge Marshall, but affecting an air of contempt for his alleged\r\ninconsistencies, as Burr asserted he (the judge) did not, for the last\r\ntwo days, understand either the questions or himself; that he had\r\nwavered in his opinions before yesterday's adjournment, and should, in\r\nfuture, be put right by _strong language_. I am afraid to say _abuse_,\r\nthough I think I could swear he used that word. I learned from Major\r\nSmith to-day a confirmation of what Colonel de Pestre had also\r\nmentioned to me, that Burr sets off immediately for England after his\r\nliberation to collect money for reorganizing his projects.\"\r\n\r\n\"September 22, 1807. I have seen a complete file of all the\r\ndepositions made before the grand jury in Burr's possession. It must\r\nbe confessed that few other men in his circumstances could have\r\nprocured these documents out of the custody of offices filled by his\r\ninveterate enemies. Burr asserted to-day, in court, that he expected\r\ndocuments that would disqualify Eaton as a witness.\"\r\n\r\n\"September 26, 1807. Wilkinson, in his examination, confessed that he\r\nhad altered the cipher letter, and sworn that there were no\r\nalterations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of Dudley Woodbridge, [2] it must not be concealed from those who may\r\nhave access to these _notes_ that, although he is reputed to have\r\ngiven a fair, candid, and to us an advantageous testimony, _he has not\r\nyet told the whole truth, having suppressed my communication to him of\r\nour designs being unequivocally against Mexico_, which I suppose he\r\nkept back because he embraced and embarked in the plan on the first\r\nmention of it to him, though he afterward receded from it upon his own\r\nreflections or counsel of others. Such is the address with which\r\ningratitude and dishonesty are made to pass in the garb of integrity,\r\nlike towcloth under fine muslin.\"\r\n\r\n\"October 8, 1807. I called on Burr this morning, when he at last\r\nmentioned to me, during a short tête-à-tête, that he was preparing to\r\ngo to England; that the time was now auspicious for him, and he wished\r\nto know whether I could give him letters. I answered that I supposed,\r\nwhen he mentioned England, he meant London, as his business would\r\nprobably be with people in office; that I knew none of the present\r\nministry, nor did I believe I had a single acquaintance in London. He\r\nreplied, that he meant to visit every part of the country, and would\r\nbe glad to get letters to any one. I said I would think of it, that I\r\nmight discover whether I had any friends there whom it would be an\r\nobject worth his attention to know, and took leave. We can only\r\nconjecture his designs. For my part, I am disposed to suspect he has\r\nno serious intent of reviving any of his speculations in America, or\r\neven of returning from Europe if he can get there.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Colonel Burr's return to the United States from Europe, he\r\nreceived several letters from Blennerhassett; in two of them he refers\r\nto a suit which he commenced against General Andrew Jackson, in Adams\r\ncounty, Mississippi territory, for a balance due Burr. In reply to an\r\ninquiry made on the subject under date of the 4th of October, 1812, he\r\nsays, \"I allude to an account between yourself and Andrew Jackson, in\r\nhis own handwriting, on which appears a balance in your favour of\r\n$1726 62,\" &c. He then speaks of other papers, and adds, \"As to the\r\nmanner in which I obtained the papers, it happened to be discovered\r\nthat the portmanteau you left with me, to be transmitted to Mr.\r\nAlston, which lay at my disposal in the house of Mr. Harding, near\r\nNatchez, was broken open by his servants. On this discovery I called\r\nfor the portmanteau, found the lock torn off, and some papers tumbled\r\nand abused, which had seemingly been all opened. I observed and took\r\nout the above document. The rest, with a silk tent, await the\r\ndisposition of your orders.\"\r\n\r\nIn another letter, in a paroxysm of passion, he threatens the\r\npublication of a book, which he says is to be entitled,\r\n\r\n\"A review of the projects and intrigues of Aaron Burr during the years\r\n1805, 1806, and 1807, involving therein, as parties or privies, Thomas\r\nJefferson, A. Gallatin, Dr. Eustis, Governor Alston, Daniel Clark,\r\nGenerals Wilkinson, Dearborn, Harrison, Jackson, and Smith, and the\r\nlate Spanish ambassador Yrujo, exhibiting original documents and\r\ncorrespondence hitherto unpublished. Compiled from the notes and\r\nprivate journal kept during the above period by Herman Blennerhassett,\r\nLLD.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been seen that General Wilkinson _altered_ the letter written\r\nin cipher by Colonel Burr, and then swore that the translation was a\r\ntrue copy of the original. This alteration was for the purpose of\r\nestablishing _treasonable_ designs in Burr and his associates, to\r\nwhich fact the general had also sworn. But while he was thus urging\r\nthe charge of _treason_ at home, he had to give his Spanish employers\r\na different account of the movements and object of Burr. Accordingly,\r\nafter the trial at Richmond, General Wilkinson despatched Captain\r\nWalter Burling, his aid, to demand of the vice-king of Mexico the\r\nrepayment of his expenditures and compensation for his services to\r\nSpain in defeating Burr's expedition against Mexico. The modesty of\r\nthis demand, being only about _two hundred thousand dollars_, is\r\nworthy of notice. The development of this fact places in a new point\r\nof view Mr. Jefferson's confidential friend (General Wilkinson)--that\r\nfriend whom he recommended to Congress on the 22d of January, 1S07, as\r\nhaving acted \"with the _honour of a soldier and the fidelity of a good\r\ncitizen_.\" The documents are presented without comment.\r\n\r\n_State of Louisiana, City of New-Orleans_.\r\n\r\nBefore me, William Young Lewis, notary public in and for the city of\r\nNew-Orleans, duly commissioned and sworn, this day personally appeared\r\nRichard Raynal Keene, Esq., attorney and counsellor at law of this\r\ncity, who delivered to me, the said notary, and requested the same to\r\nbe annexed to the current records of my office, the following\r\ndocuments, _to wit_:--\r\n\r\n_First_. A certificate of the vice-queen of Mexico, dated at Madrid on\r\nthe twenty-fourth day of January, eighteen hundred and sixteen.\r\n\r\n_Second_. A letter from the said Richard R. Keene to the Reverend Dr.\r\nMangan, dated at Madrid on the twenty-first day of July, eighteen\r\nhundred and twenty-one.\r\n\r\n_Third_. The reply of the Reverend Dr. Mangan to the aforesaid letter,\r\ndated at Madrid on the twenty-third day of July, eighteen hundred and\r\ntwenty-one.\r\n\r\nAll of which said documents I have accordingly annexed to my current\r\nregister, there to remain and serve as the case may be, after having\r\nmarked the same _ne varietur_, to identify them with this act.\r\n\r\nDone and passed at New-Orleans, this twenty-fourth day of December,\r\neighteen hundred and thirty-six, in presence of William T. Lewis and\r\nGustavus Harper, both of this city, witnesses, who have hereunto\r\nsigned their names with said, and me the said notary. Signed, Richard\r\nR. Keene, William T.

Pub.\r\n\r\n_Certificate of the Vice-queen_.\r\n\r\n\"Whereas his excellency, the Marquis of Campo-Sagrado, minister of\r\nwar, has been pleased to accede to the request of Richard Raynal\r\nKeene, colonel of the royal armies, addressed to him under date of the\r\n12th instant, with the view of obtaining my declaration respecting the\r\nmission sent by the Anglo-American brigadier, James Wilkinson, to my\r\nlate husband, Don Jose Yturrigaray, lieutenant-general of the royal\r\narmies in Mexico, during the period of his command as viceroy in that\r\ncountry; now, for the purpose required, I do declare and certify,\r\nthat, having accompanied my said husband to Mexico, and stayed there\r\nwith him during the time of his command as viceroy in that country, to\r\nwit, from the year 1802 to the year 1808, I recollect perfectly well\r\nthe aforesaid mission, which was carried into effect by a person of\r\nthe name of Burling; and although I cannot now undertake to relate all\r\nthe details of that mission, nevertheless my memory enables me to\r\nstate that, in substance, the exposition made by Keene to the minister\r\nof war, of the artifices and stratagems resorted to by Wilkinson on\r\nthat occasion, through his confidential agent, is just and true. The\r\ninterested views manifested by Wilkinson _in his reclamation of large\r\nsums of money for his alleged disbursements_ in counteracting the\r\nhostile plans of the American vice-president, Burr, against Mexico,\r\nappeared to the viceroy to be no less incompatible with the rights of\r\nhis majesty than they were _irreconcilable to the honour of an officer\r\nand patriot_ of a foreign state. The viceroy, therefore, did not give\r\na single ducat to Burling, but took immediate steps for having him\r\nremoved from the country.\r\n\r\nThis is what I declare, in compliance with the requisition of his\r\nexcellency the minister of war. Madrid, January 24, 1816.\r\n\r\nMARIA INES JAUREGUI DE YTURRIGARAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMadrid, July 21, 1821.\r\n\r\nREV. SIR,\r\n\r\nI send you an exposition of the vice-queen Donna Maria Ines Jauregui\r\nde Yturrigaray, of the 24th January, 1816, relative to the intrigue\r\nwhich the brigadier Wilkinson attempted to carry into effect in 1806\r\nor 1807, through the agency of Mr. Burling, for the purpose of getting\r\nmoney from the vice-king of Mexico. The vice-queen told me, in the\r\ndifferent conversations I had with her on this subject, that you\r\nenjoyed the full and entire confidence of her husband, and that he,\r\nbesides speaking with you unreservedly about this affair, commissioned\r\nyou to interpret the letter which Wilkinson sent him through Mr.\r\nBurling, the said letter having been written in English. The\r\nvice-king, had he not died suddenly, would have given me the same\r\nexposition which his widow gave me. It being then, in some sort, a\r\nmatter of justice that you should give your declaration relative to\r\nthe aforesaid exposition of the vice-queen, I therefore pray you to do\r\nso.\r\n\r\nI will merely add that, in one of my conversations with the vice-king,\r\nhe told me that, in the aforesaid letter, Wilkinson, in speaking of\r\nhis service rendered in frustrating what he called the invasion of\r\nMexico by the ex-vice-president, Mr. Burr, likened himself to\r\n_Leonidas in the pass of Thermopylae_. Be assured, reverend sir, of my\r\nprofound respect.\r\n\r\nRICHARD RAYNAL KEENE,\r\n\r\nColonel in the service of H. C. M.\r\n\r\nRev. Dr. MANGAN, _Rector of the Irish College in Salamanca._ Madrid,\r\nJuly 23, 1821\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI have carefully read the exposition you enclosed me in your esteemed\r\nfavour of the 21st instant, of the former vice-queen of Mexico, La\r\nSenora Donna Maria Ines Jauregui de Yturrigaray, relative to the\r\nfamous embassy of General Wilkinson to her husband Don Joseph de\r\nYturrigaray, viceroy of Mexico.\r\n\r\nAs his excellency was pleased to make use of me as interpreter in the\r\ninterview he granted Mr. Walter Burling, the bearer of a letter from\r\nthe aforesaid General Wilkinson, and commissioned by him to manifest\r\nto the viceroy the importance of his embassy, I candidly confess that,\r\nto the best of my recollection, the exposition of the vice-queen is\r\nperfectly correct, for the object of the famous embassy of Mr. Burling\r\nwas to display to the viceroy _the great pecuniary sacrifices_ made by\r\nGeneral Wilkinson to frustrate the plan of invasion meditated by the\r\nex-vice-president, Mr. Burr, against the kingdom of Mexico, and to\r\nsolicit, in consideration of such important services, a pretty round\r\nsum of _at least two hundred thousand dollars_.\r\n\r\nI cannot help observing that the viceroy, Don Joseph de Yturrigaray,\r\nreceived this communication with due contempt and indignation, bidding\r\nme to tell Mr. Burling that General Wilkinson, in counteracting any\r\ntreasonable plan of Mr. Burr, did no more than comply with his duty;\r\nthat he (the viceroy) would take good care to defend the kingdom of\r\nMexico against any attack or invasion, and that he did not think\r\nhimself authorized to give one farthing to General Wilkinson in\r\ncompensation for his pretended services. He concluded by ordering Mr.\r\nBurling to leave the city of Mexico, and had him safely escorted to\r\nthe port of Vera Cruz, where he immediately embarked for the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThis is, believe me, the substance (as far as I can recollect) of the\r\nfamous embassy of General Wilkinson to the viceroy of Mexico, Don\r\nJoseph de Yturrigaray, who certainly was not mistaken in the passage\r\nhe mentioned to you of Leonidas, as I recollect well that General\r\nWilkinson, after displaying in a pompous style the great difficulties\r\nhe had to encounter to render Mr. Burr's plan fruitless, concluded by\r\naffirming--\"_I, like Leonidas, boldly threw myself in the pass_,\" &c.\r\n\r\nI return you the original exposition of the vice-queen, Donna Maria\r\nInes Jauregui de Yturrigaray, and remain yours,\r\n\r\nPATRICK MANGAN, Rector of the Irish College of Salamanca.\r\n\r\nRICHARD R. KEENE, Colonel in the service H. C. M.\r\n\r\nI hereby certify that the foregoing is a true copy of the originals\r\nannexed to my current register. In witness whereof I grant these\r\npresents, under my hand and seal, at New-Orleans, this 26th day of\r\nDecember, 1836.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM Y. LEWIS, Not. Pub.\r\n\r\nThe following short extracts from the letters of Colonel Burr to his\r\ndaughter, while he was imprisoned in Richmond, will serve to show the\r\nstate of his mind under circumstances thus oppressive and mortifying.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\n\"Richmond, March 27, 1807.\r\n\r\n\"My military escort having arrived at Fredericksburgh on our way to\r\nWashington, there met a special messenger, with orders to convey me to\r\nthis place. Hither we came forthwith, and arrived last evening. It\r\nseems that here the business is to be tried and concluded. I am to be\r\nsurrendered to the civil authority to-morrow, when the question of\r\nbail will be determined. In the mean time I remain at the Eagle\r\ntavern.\"\r\n\r\n\"April 26, 1807.\r\n\r\n\"Your letters of the 10th and those preceding seemed to indicate a\r\nsort of stupor; but now you rise into phrensy. Another ten days will,\r\nit is hoped, have brought you back to reason. It ought not, however,\r\nto be forgotten that the letter of the 15th was written under a\r\nparoxysm of the toothache.\r\n\r\n\"You have read to very little purpose if you have not remarked that\r\nsuch things happen in all democratic governments. Was there in Greece\r\nor Rome a man of virtue and independence, and supposed to possess\r\ngreat talents, who was not the object of vindictive and unrelenting\r\npersecution? Now, madame, I pray you to amuse yourself by collecting\r\nand collating all the instances to be found in ancient history, which\r\nyou may connect together, if you please, in an essay, with\r\nreflections, comments, and applications. This I may hope to receive\r\nabout the 22d of May. I promise myself great pleasure in the perusal,\r\nand I promise you great satisfaction and consolation in the\r\ncomposition.\"\r\n\r\n\"May 15, 1807.\r\n\r\n\"Respecting the approaching investigation, I can communicate nothing\r\nnew. The grand jury is composed of twenty democrats and four\r\nfederalists. Among the former is W. C. Nicholas, my vindictive and\r\navowed personal enemy--the most so that could be found in this state\r\n(Virginia).\r\n\r\nThe most indefatigable industry is used by the agents of government,\r\nand they have money at command without stint. If I were possessed of\r\nthe same means, I could not only foil the prosecutors, but render them\r\nridiculous and infamous. The democratic papers teem with abuse against\r\nme and my counsel, and even against the chief justice. Nothing is left\r\nundone or unsaid which can tend to prejudice the public mind, and\r\nproduce a conviction without evidence. The machinations of this\r\ndescription which were used against Moreau in France were treated in\r\nthis country with indignation. They are practised against me in a\r\nstill more impudent degree, not only with impunity, but with applause;\r\nand the authors and abettors suppose, with reason, that they are\r\nacquiring favour with the administration.\"\r\n\r\n\"June 3, 1807.\r\n\r\n\"Still waiting for Wilkinson, and no certain accounts of his approach.\r\nThe grand jury, the witnesses, and the country grow impatient. It is\r\nan ungracious thing, and so deemed, after having for six months been\r\nbranded as a traitor; after directing that Burr and his followers\r\nshould be attacked, put to death, and their property seized; after all\r\nthe violations of law and constitution which have been practised, that\r\ngovernment should now say it has not proof!\r\n\r\n\"Busy, busy, busy from morning till night--from night till morning,\r\nyet there are daily amusing incidents; things at which you will laugh,\r\nalso things at which you will pout and scold.\"\r\n\r\n\"June 18, 1807.\r\n\r\n\"On Saturday morning General Wilkinson, with ten or eleven witnesses\r\nfrom New Orleans, arrived in Richmond. Four bills were immediately\r\ndelivered to the grand jury against Blennerhassett and Burr; one for\r\ntreason and one for misdemeanour against each. The examination of the\r\nwitnesses was immediately commenced. They had gone through thirty-two\r\nlast evening. There are about forty-six. General Eaton has been\r\nalready examined. He came out of the jury-room in such rage and\r\nagitation that he shed tears, and complained bitterly that he had been\r\nquestioned as if he were a villain. How else could he have been\r\nquestioned with any propriety?\r\n\r\n\"Poor Bollman is placed in a most awkward predicament. Some days ago\r\nMr. Hay, the district attorney, in open court tendered him a pardon\r\nunder the great seal and with the sign manual of _Thomas Jefferson_.\r\nBollman refused to receive it. Hay urged it upon him. Bollman said\r\nthat no man could force on him such a badge of infamy. Hay insisted\r\nthat he was a pardoned man, whether he would or not; and this question\r\nwill, probably, also come before the court in argument to-day or\r\nto-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"June 22, 1807.\r\n\r\nOn Friday Mr. Hay complained that Burr had so constantly occupied the\r\ncourt for the four weeks past with his extraordinary motions, that he\r\n(Mr. Hay) could not get an opportunity of making one on his part; he\r\ntherefore gave notice that he should, at the first interval, move for\r\nleave to send to the grand jury interrogatories for their instruction,\r\nto be put to the witnesses, in order that the _whole truth_ might come\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\"Burr said it was a thing without example, and which the court could\r\nnot permit without his assent; but he thought there was reason in the\r\nproposal of Mr. Hay, and that he should cheerfully assent, with the\r\ncondition only that he (Burr) should also send interrogatories, to be\r\nput to the same witnesses, the better to extract the _'whole truth.'_\r\n\r\n\"The court said that it certainly could not be permitted to Mr. Hay to\r\nsend interrogatories, being against usage and reason; but as Mr. Burr\r\nhad assented, there seemed to be no objection that both parties should\r\nsend in interrogatories; and such permission was granted, whereupon\r\nMr. Hay withdrew his motion.\"\r\n\r\n\"June 24, 1807.\r\n\r\n\"While we were engaged to-day in the argument of the question for an\r\nattachment against Wilkinson, the grand jury came into court with\r\nbills against Blennerhassett and myself for treason and misdemeanour.\r\nTwo bills against each of us. These indictments for treason are\r\nfounded on the following allegations: that Colonel Tyler, with twenty\r\nor thirty men, stopped at Blennerhassett's Island on their way down\r\nthe Ohio; that though these men were not armed, and had no military\r\narray or organization, and though they did neither use force nor\r\nthreaten it, yet, having set out with a view of taking temporary\r\npossession of New-Orleans on their way to Mexico, that such intent was\r\ntreasonable, and therefore a war was levied on Blennerhassett's Island\r\nby _construction_; and that, though Colonel Burr was then at Frankfort\r\non his way to Tennessee, yet, having advised the measure, he was, _by\r\nconstruction of law_, present at the island, and levied war there. In\r\nfact, the indictment charges that Aaron Burr was on that day present\r\nat the island, though not a man of the jury supposed this to be true.\r\n\r\n\"This idea of _constructive war_ is, by this jury, carried far beyond\r\nthe dictum advanced by Judge Chace in the case of Fries; for Chace\r\nlaid down that the actual exertion of force, in a hostile or\r\ntraitorous manner, was indispensable to establish treason. Yet the\r\nopinions of Chace in this case were complained of by the whole\r\nrepublican party, and condemned by all the lawyers of all parties in\r\nPhiladelphia, as tending to introduce the odious and unconstitutional\r\ndoctrine of _constructive treason_.\r\n\r\n\"Out of fifty witnesses who have been examined before the grand jury,\r\nit may be safely alleged that thirty at least have been perjured.\r\n\r\n\"I beg and expect it of you that you will conduct yourself as becomes\r\nmy daughter, and that you manifest no signs of weakness or alarm.\"\r\n\r\nJune 30, 1807.\r\n\r\n\"Of myself you could expect to hear nothing new; yet something new and\r\nunexpected was moved yesterday. The counsel for the prosecution\r\nproposed to the court that Aaron Burr should be sent to the\r\npenitentiary for safe keeping, and stated that the governor and\r\ncouncil had offered to provide me with an apartment in the third story\r\nof that building. This is extremely kind and obliging in the governor\r\nand his council. The distance, however, would render it so\r\ninconvenient to my counsel to visit me, that I should prefer to remain\r\nwhere I am; yet the rooms proposed are said to be airy and healthy.\"\r\n\r\nJuly 3, 1807.\r\n\r\n\"I have three rooms in the third story of the penitentiary, making an\r\nextent of one hundred feet. My jailer is quite a polite and civil\r\nman--altogether unlike the idea one would form of a jailer. You would\r\nhave laughed to have heard our compliments the first evening.\r\n\r\n\"_Jailer_. I hope, sir, it would not be disagreeable to you if I\r\nshould lock this door after dark.\r\n\r\n\"_Burr_. By no means, sir; I should prefer it, to keep out intruders.\r\n\r\n\"_Jailer_. It is our custom, sir, to extinguish all lights at nine\r\no'clock; I hope, sir, you will have no objection to conform to that.\r\n\r\n\"_Burr_. That, Sir, I am sorry to say, is impossible; for I never go\r\nto bed till twelve, and always burn two candles.\r\n\r\n\"_Jailer_. Very well, sir, just as you please. I should have been glad\r\nif it had been otherwise; but, as you please, sir.\r\n\r\n\"While I have been writing different servants have arrived with\r\nmessages, notes, and inquiries, bringing oranges, lemons, pineapples,\r\nraspberries, apricots, cream, butter, ice, and some ordinary\r\narticles.\"\r\n\r\n\"July 6, 1807.\r\n\r\n\"My friends and acquaintance of both sexes are permitted to visit me\r\nwithout interruption, without inquiring their business, and without\r\nthe _presence of a spy_. It is well that I have an antechamber, or I\r\nshould often be gênê with visitors.\r\n\r\n\"If you come I can give you a bedroom and parlour on this floor. The\r\nbedroom has three large closets, and it is a much more commodious one\r\nthan you ever had in your life. Remember, no agitations, no\r\ncomplaints, no fears or anxieties on the road, or I renounce thee.\"\r\n\r\n\"July 24, 1807.\r\n\r\n\"I want an independent and discerning witness to my conduct and to\r\nthat of the government.

Those gentlemen replied that General Wilkinson _had_ stood\r\nvery low in the estimation of the President, but that his energetic\r\nconduct at New-Orleans had raised him in estimation; that he now stood\r\nvery high, and that the president would support him; that if the\r\ngovernment should now prosecute Wilkinson, or do any thing to impair\r\nhis credit, Burr would escape, and that was just what the federalists\r\nand the enemies to the administration wished.\"\r\n\r\n\"October 23, 1807.\r\n\r\n\"After all, this is a sort of drawn battle.

The personal and\r\npolitical prejudices which the influence of power and the death of\r\nHamilton had excited against him; rendered, as he conceived, a\r\ntemporary absence from this country desirable; and, at the same time,\r\nbelieving that the political situation of Europe offered opportunities\r\nfor accomplishing the object he had long contemplated, of emancipating\r\nthe Spanish American colonies from the degrading tyranny of Spain, it\r\nwas his design to solicit the aid of some European government in such\r\nan undertaking. With these views he embarked for England.\r\n\r\nDuring his residence in Europe he regularly corresponded with his\r\ndaughter, Mrs. Alston, and also kept a private diary; but probably\r\nfrom the apprehension that his papers were at all times subject to the\r\nsupervision of the government police, his memoranda are in a great\r\nmeasure restricted to occurrences private and personal. An amusing\r\nvolume [1] _might_ be made of these daily records of his privations\r\nand personal adventures during his protracted and forced residence in\r\nEurope, but the limits of the present work compel us to pass hastily\r\nover this period of his life.\r\n\r\nHe arrived in Falmouth on the 15th, and in London on the 16th July;\r\nand on the same day, with characteristic promptitude, he presented his\r\nletters of introduction, and, among others, to John Reeves, Esq., then\r\nin the department of the secretary of state, through whom he seems to\r\nhave hoped to gain access to the ministry.\r\n\r\nDuring the next three months he made, through Mr. Reeves and others,\r\nvarious unsuccessful efforts to approach the government; but there\r\nwere two obstacles in his way, both of which were insuperable. The\r\nSpaniards were then in the commencement of their noble resistance to\r\nthe invasion of Napoleon, and the enthusiasm of the British nation in\r\nfavour of the Spanish patriots, as well as the policy of the British\r\ngovernment, were absolutely opposed to any scheme for separating the\r\ncolonies from Spain. But, in addition to this obstacle, Colonel Burr,\r\nfrom the moment of his landing in England, was an object of suspicion\r\nand distrust to the government. The alien-bill was then in stern\r\noperation, and apprehensions were entertained of the emissaries of\r\nFrance; and it is not to be doubted that the same hostility which, as\r\nwe shall see, openly displayed itself in the conduct of the United\r\nStates' agents towards Colonel Burr in France, had been excited to\r\nmisrepresent and anticipate him in his negotiations with the British\r\ngovernment. After various interviews, that led to nothing, with Mr.\r\nCanning, Lord Mulgrave, and Lord Melville, on the 6th November, 1808,\r\nthe following communication from A. Merry put an end to all hopes of\r\nassistance in his plans from the English ministry:--\r\n\r\nSunday morning, November 6.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nAlthough I could not see Mr. Canning yesterday, from his being gone\r\ninto the country, to stay till Tuesday morning, for the recovery of\r\nhis health, I conversed with another person of nearly equal authority,\r\nwho told me he was sure that what you proposed to me yesterday could\r\nnever be consented to, pointing it out in every way to be\r\nimpracticable. I beg you to excuse the haste in which I write, and\r\nbelieve me to be, dear sir,\r\n\r\nYour most faithful humble servant,\r\n\r\nA. MERRY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn private life in England Colonel Burr received much attention, and\r\nfrom no one more than _Jeremy Bentham_, with whom he formed a warm and\r\nintimate friendship. In a letter to his daughter of the 8th September,\r\n1808, he speaks of Mr. Bentham:--\"I hasten to make you acquainted with\r\nJeremy Bentham, author of a work entitled 'Principles of Morals and\r\nLegislation' (edited in French by Dumont), and of many other works of\r\nless labour and research. You will well recollect to have heard me\r\nplace this man second to no one, ancient or modern, in profound\r\nthinking, in logical and analytic reasoning. On the 8th of August I\r\nreceived a letter from him, containing a most friendly invitation to\r\ncome and pass some days with him at a farm (where he passes the\r\nsummer) called Barrowgreen, near Gadstone, and twenty miles from\r\nLondon. I was not tardy in profiting of this invitation. He met me at\r\nthe gate with the frankness and affection of an old friend. Mr.\r\nBentham's countenance has all that character of intense thought which\r\nyou would expect to find; but it is impossible to conceive a\r\nphysiognomy more strongly marked with ingenuousness and philanthropy.\r\nI have passed twelve days there, and shall return to-morrow, to stay\r\nmost probably till he returns to town. His house in the city, which I\r\nnow occupy solely and exclusively--[N. B. Three servants in the house\r\nat my command]--is most beautifully situated on St. James's Park, with\r\nextensive gardens, and built and fitted up more to my taste than any\r\none I ever saw. In his library I am now writing.\"\r\n\r\nThe friendship of Mr. Bentham was uniform and constant; and if it did\r\nnot preserve his friend from severe pecuniary privations and distress\r\nin Colonel Burr's second residence in England, it was because the\r\nextent of these privations was industriously and ingeniously concealed\r\nfrom him. \"The benevolent heart of J. B.\" (Burr remarks in his diary,\r\nwhen apprehending an arrest for debt) \"shall never be pained by the\r\nexhibition of my distress.\" Bentham, long after Burr's return to the\r\nUnited States, continued to correspond with him.\r\n\r\nWith William Godwin Mr. Burr also formed an intimate and friendly\r\nacquaintance. In a visit to Edinburgh in the winter of 1809, he seems\r\nto have been treated with great distinction; and his diary is\r\nsprinkled with the names of visitors the most distinguished in rank,\r\nfashion, and letters of the Scottish metropolis. He writes to his\r\ndaughter 12th February, 1809: \"Among the literary men of Edinburgh I\r\nhave met M'Kenzie, author of the Man of Feeling, and Scott, author of\r\nthe Minstrel. I met both frequently, and from both received civilities\r\nand hospitality. M'Kenzie has twelve children--six daughters, all very\r\ninteresting and handsome. He is remarkably sprightly in company,\r\namiable, witty--might pass for forty-two, though certainly much older.\r\nScott, with less softness than M'Kenzie, has still more animation;\r\ntalks much, and very agreeably.\"\r\n\r\nWhile in Edinburgh Colonel Burr was informed by Lord Justice Clarke\r\nthat Lord Melville had mentioned in a letter that it would be\r\nnecessary for Mr. Burr to return to London. The government began now\r\nto evince great distrust of him. He seems at one time, and before he\r\nhad abandoned all hope of receiving assistance in his political\r\nschemes, to have resolved to resist the operation of the alien bill,\r\nby claiming the rights of a British subject. He probably suggested\r\nthis singular claim at the instance of his friend Reeves. The ground\r\nhe took was that, having been born a British subject, he had a right\r\nto reassume his allegiance at pleasure; or rather that it was\r\nindefeasible, and never could be parted with. The claim appears to\r\nhave caused some sensation among the crown lawyers. It was certainly\r\nunfounded and injudiciously asserted. Lord Liverpool pronounced it\r\nmonstrous; and it probably increased the suspicion and distrust\r\nalready existing.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th April, 1809, the government took active measures against\r\nhim. He writes in his journal of that day--\"Having a confused\r\npresentiment that something was wrong, I packed up my papers and\r\nclothes with intent to go out and seek other lodgings. At one o'clock\r\ncame in without knocking four coarse-looking men, who said they had a\r\nstate warrant for seizing me and my papers, but refused to show the\r\nwarrant. I was peremptory, and the warrant was produced, signed\r\n'Liverpool,' but I was not permitted to read the whole. They took\r\npossession of my trunks, searched every part of the rooms for papers,\r\nthrew all the loose articles into a sack, called a coach, and away we\r\nwent to the alien office. Before going I wrote a note to Reeves, and\r\non our arrival sent it in--waited one hour in the coach--very cold,\r\nbut I refused to go in. Wrote in pencil to Reeves another note. He\r\ncame out. We had a little conversation. He could not then explain, but\r\nsaid I must have patience. After half an hour more orders were that I\r\nmust go with one of the messengers to his house. On this order I first\r\nwent into the office to see Brooks, the under secretary, whom I knew\r\n[you may recollect the transaction in July, which must have fixed me\r\nin his memory]. He did not know me--none of them knew me--though every\r\ndevil of them knew me as well as I know you. Seeing the measure was\r\nresolved on, and having inquired of the sort of restraint to which I\r\nwas doomed, I wrote a note to Koe, which Brooks took to show to Lord\r\nLiverpool for his approbation to forward it--arrived at my prison, 31\r\nStafford Place, at four.\" In two days, however, he was released, and\r\nhis papers returned unopened; but he was informed he must leave the\r\nkingdom. Some days afterward, as he still lingered, a message was\r\nconveyed to him:--\"Lord Liverpool expects you to leave London\r\nto-morrow, and the kingdom in forty-eight hours.\" And on the 24th\r\nApril, 1809, he sailed from Harwich in his B. M. packet Diana for\r\nGottenburgh.\r\n\r\nOn leaving England Mr. Burr seems to have been undetermined as to his\r\nfuture movements. He was unwilling to renounce the projects which had\r\ncarried him to Europe; and all hope of assistance from England being\r\nended, he looked next for aid to Napoleon, whose policy, from the\r\nresistance of Spain and the preponderancy of the British navy, was now\r\nin favour of the independence of the Spanish American colonies. He\r\nfinally resolved to wait in Sweden till he received advices from\r\nAmerica, and then proceed to Paris to communicate with the emperor.\r\n\r\nWe must pass over his residence in Sweden, and his subsequent tour\r\nthrough Germany to Paris, during the whole of which period he kept a\r\njournal. He visited Hamburgh, Hanover, Saxe-Gotha, Weimar, and\r\nFrankfort; and, though travelling without letters or introduction, it\r\nappears from his itinerary that he was everywhere treated with\r\ndistinction and attention. At Hamburg, where he arrived the 20th\r\nNovember, 1809, De Bourrienne, since known as the author of the\r\nMemoirs of Bonaparte, was the French minister. It will be amusing,\r\nperhaps, to compare the following extracts from De Bourrienne's work\r\nwith a brief memorandum from Colonel Burr's diary, showing in what\r\nlight they reciprocally regarded each other.\r\n\r\n\"At the height of his glory and power, Bonaparte was so suspicious\r\nthat the veriest trifle sufficed to alarm him. I recollect that about\r\nthe time the complaints were made respecting the _Minerva_\r\n(newspaper), Colonel Burr, formerly vice-president of the United\r\nStates, who had recently arrived at Altona, was pointed out to me as a\r\ndangerous man, and I received orders to watch him very closely, and to\r\narrest him on the slightest ground of suspicion if he should come to\r\nHamburgh. Colonel Burr was one of those in favour of whom I ventured\r\nto disobey the orders I received from the restless police of Paris. As\r\nsoon as the minister of the police heard of his arrival at Altona, he\r\ndirected me to adopt towards him those violent measures which are\r\nequivalent to persecution. In answer to these instructions, I stated\r\nthat Colonel Burr conducted himself at Altona with much prudence and\r\npropriety; that he kept but little company, and that he was scarcely\r\nspoken of. Far from regarding him as a man who required watching;\r\nhaving learned that he wished to go to Paris, I caused a passport to\r\nbe procured for him, which he was to receive at Frankfort; and I never\r\nheard that this dangerous citizen had compromised the safety of the\r\nstate in any way.\" _Bourrienne's Memoirs of Napoleon,_ vol. iv., p.\r\n108.\r\n\r\nIn his journal of November 24, Burr writes:--\r\n\r\n\"I learn that A. B. is announced in the Paris papers in a manner no\r\nway auspicious. Resolved to go direct to the French minister, to see\r\nif he had any orders to give or refuse me passports. Sent in my name,\r\nbut did not get out of my carriage; after some minutes the servant\r\nreturned, saying his excellency was then much engaged, but would be\r\nglad to see me at three. At three, to minister's; begged to call\r\ntomorrow at twelve. November 25. At twelve, the minister's; was at\r\nonce received; he is the transcript of our _Mari_, [2] only fifteen\r\nyears older, but marked with the same characters. His reception was\r\ncourteous, but with a mixture of surprise and curiosity. At once\r\noffered me passports to any frontier town, but has no authority to do\r\nmore. Passports to go to Paris must come from Paris, and to that end I\r\nmust write. Advises that I direct reply to be transmitted to Mayence.\r\nAsked me to dine, at his country-house tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\nAt Mayence, however, he found no passport; and he was detained in\r\nsuspense there and at Frankfort for a month, before permission could\r\nbe obtained to go to Paris.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th February, 1810, he arrived in Paris.\r\n\r\nHe commenced here a long and most vexatious and wearisome course of\r\nattendance on the minister of foreign relations and other high\r\nofficers of state, endeavouring in vain, by personal solicitations and\r\nmemorials, to obtain an audience of the emperor and an answer to his\r\npropositions. He attended the levees of the Duc de Cadore, the Duc de\r\nRovigo, Jerome Bonaparte, King of Westphalia; but uniformly failed in\r\nhis efforts, and was turned off with unmeaning professions. He records\r\nin his diary, with gratitude, the friendly attentions of Volney,\r\nDenon, and the Duc de Bassano; but, with these exceptions, he seems to\r\nhave been treated with great coolness, even by those to whom his\r\nhospitality had been freely tendered in America. He always suspected\r\nthat the alienation and immutable discountenance of the emperor were\r\nto be ascribed to the representations of _Talleyrand_ and the\r\nrepresentatives of the United States in France.\r\n\r\nSeveral months neglect and inattention at length discouraged him, and\r\nhe resolved to return home; but, on applying for a passport to the\r\nUnited States, he was informed by the police that he could not have a\r\npassport to go out of the empire. \"Me voila [he writes in his\r\njournal], prisonier d'Etat! et presque sans sous.\" This event changed\r\nthe course of his solicitations; and for the next year we find him,\r\nhaving abandoned all projects of ambition, limiting himself to\r\nsolicitation for permission to go home, and without success. A\r\nmemorial which he addressed to Napoleon sets forth in these manly\r\nterms the harshness and injustice of his treatment.\r\n\r\n\"While in Germany last winter I saw in the _Moniteur_ an expression of\r\nyour majesty's assent to the independence of the Spanish American\r\ncolonies. Believing that I could be useful in the execution of that\r\nobject, I hastened to Frankfort, and there addressed myself to your\r\nmajesty's minister, Monsieur Hedouville, who, at my request, wrote to\r\nthe minister of exterior relations, stating my views, and asking a\r\npassport if those views should be deemed worthy of your majesty's\r\nattention. A passport was transmitted to me. On the day of my arrival\r\nin Paris I announced myself to the Duc de Cadore, and on the day\r\nfollowing had an audience, in which I explained, as fully as the time\r\nwould admit, the nature of my projects and the means of execution.\r\nFurther details were added in subsequent conversations had with one of\r\nthe chiefs of that department. Afterward, at the request of the Duc de\r\nCadore, they were reduced to writing, of which memoir one copy was\r\ndelivered to the Duc de Cadore and another to the Duc de Rovigo, to be\r\nsubmitted to your majesty's perusal. After the lapse of some weeks,\r\nhaving received no reply, nor any intimation that my views accorded\r\nwith those of your majesty, being here without occupation and without\r\nthe means of support, I asked a passport to return to the United\r\nStates, where not only the state of the country, but my personal\r\nconcerns, demand my presence. This passport has been refused; for\r\nnearly four months I have in vain solicited. The only answer I receive\r\nis--'His majesty has not signified his assent.'\r\n\r\n\"After conduct so frank and loyal on my part, it is with reason that I\r\nam hurt and surprised at this refusal. Not only did the motives of my\r\nvisit and my conduct since my residence in France deserve a different\r\nreturn; at all times I have deserved well of your majesty and of the\r\nFrench nation. My home in the United States has been always open to\r\nFrench citizens, and few of any note who have visited the United\r\nStates have not experienced my hospitalities. At a period when the\r\nadministration of the government of the United States was hostile to\r\nFrance and Frenchmen, they received from me efficient protection.\r\nThese, sire, are my crimes against France!\r\n\r\n\"Presuming that a proceeding so distressing and unmerited--so contrary\r\nto the laws of hospitality, to the fame of your majesty's magnanimity\r\nand justice, and to that of the courtesy of the French nation, must be\r\nwithout your majesty's knowledge, and that, amid the mighty concerns\r\nwhich weigh on your majesty's mind, those of an individual so humble\r\nas myself may have escaped your notice, I venture to intrude into your\r\npresence, and to ask either a passport to return to the United States,\r\nor, if in fact your majesty, with the expectation of rendering me\r\nuseful to you, should wish a further delay, that I may be informed of\r\nthe period of that delay, that I may take measures accordingly for my\r\nsubsistence.\"\r\n\r\nThis memorial passed without notice.\r\n\r\nThe following correspondence between Colonel Burr and Mr. Jonathan\r\nRussell, then Chargé d'Affaires at Paris, and Mr. M'Rae, American\r\nConsul at Paris, will show the conduct of representatives of the\r\nUnited States to an American citizen in want and in a foreign land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. RUSSELL.\r\n\r\nParis, October 25, 1810.\r\n\r\nMr. Burr presents respectful compliments. As a citizen of the United\r\nStates, he requests of Mr. Russell an official certificate to that\r\neffect, and will have the honour of calling for the purpose at any\r\nhour which he may be pleased to name. The fact of Mr. Burr's\r\ncitizenship being sufficiently known to Mr. Russell, it is presumed\r\nthat other proof will be deemed unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MR. RUSSELL.\r\n\r\nParis, October 25, 1810.\r\n\r\nIn reply to Mr. Burr's note of this morning, Mr. Russell begs leave to\r\ninform him that the province of granting passports to citizens of the\r\nUnited States belongs to the consul, to whom all wishing for that\r\nprotection must apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. M'RAE.\r\n\r\nParis, October 29, 1810.\r\n\r\nMr. Burr presents compliments. Having addressed himself to Mr. Russell\r\nfor a certificate of citizenship, has been informed by him that the\r\nbusiness of granting certificates was transferred to the consul. He\r\ntherefore repeats the request to Mr. M'Rae. If a personal attendance\r\nbe deemed necessary, Mr. Burr will wait on Mr. M'Rae for the purpose\r\nat any hour he may be pleased to appoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MR. M'RAE.\r\n\r\nParis, October 29, 1810.\r\n\r\nMr. M'Rae answers to Mr. Burr's note of this morning, that his\r\nknowledge of the circumstances under which Mr. Burr left the United\r\nStates renders it his duty to decline giving Mr. Burr either a\r\npassport or a permis de séjour. If, however, the opinion Mr. M'Rae has\r\nformed and the determination he has adopted on this subject be\r\nerroneous, there is a remedy at hand.\r\n\r\nAlthough the business of granting passports and permis de séjour\r\ngenerally is confided to the consul, the chargé des affaires\r\nunquestionably possesses full authority to grant protection in either\r\nof those forms to any person to whom it may be improperly denied by\r\nthe consul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. RUSSELL.\r\n\r\nParis, November 1, 1810.\r\n\r\nOn receipt of Mr. Russell's note, Mr. Burr applied to the consul; a\r\ncopy of his reply is herewith enclosed. It cannot be material to\r\ninquire what are the _\"circumstances\"_ referred to by the consul, nor\r\nwhether true or false. Mr. Burr is ignorant of any statute or\r\ninstruction which authorizes a foreign minister or agent to inquire\r\ninto any circumstances other than those which tend to establish the\r\nfact of citizen or not. If, however, Mr. Russell should be of a\r\ndifferent opinion, Mr. Burr is ready to satisfy him that no\r\ncircumstances exist which can, by any construction, in the slightest\r\ndegree impair his rights as a citizen, and that the conclusions of the\r\nconsul are founded in error, either in point of fact or of inference.\r\nYet, conceiving that every citizen has a right to demand a certificate\r\nor passport, Mr. Burr is constrained to renew his application to Mr.\r\nRussell, to whom the consul has been pleased to refer the decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MR. RUSSELL.\r\n\r\nParis, November 4, 1810.\r\n\r\nWithout subscribing to the opinion of Mr. M'Rae with regard to the\r\nappeal that lays from the erroneous decisions of the consul to the\r\nchargé d'affaires, Mr. Russell has no objection to judging the case\r\nwhich Mr. Burr has presented to him.\r\n\r\nThe man who evades the offended laws of his country, abandons, for the\r\ntime, the right to their protection. This fugitive from justice,\r\nduring his voluntary exile, has a claim to no other passport than one\r\nwhich shall enable him to surrender himself for trial for the offences\r\nwith which he stands charged. Such a passport Mr. Russell will furnish\r\nto Mr. Burr, but no other.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1810 and 1811, being cut off from remittances from\r\nAmerica, it appears from his journal that he suffered sad privations\r\nfrom the want of money.\r\n\r\nIn his diary of November 23, he writes--\"Nothing from America, and\r\nreally I shall starve. Borrowed three francs to-day. Four or five\r\nlittle debts keep me in constant alarm; all together, about two\r\nLouis.\"\r\n\r\nDecember 1, 1810. \"----- came in upon me this morning, just as I was\r\nout of bed, for twenty-seven livres. Paid him, which took literally my\r\nlast sous. When at Denon's, thought I might as well go to St.\r\nPelasgie; set off, but recollected I owed the woman who sits in the\r\npassage two sous for a segar, so turned about to pursue my way by Pont\r\ndes Arts, which was within fifty paces; remembered I had not wherewith\r\nto pay the toll, being one sous; had to go all the way round by the\r\nPont Royal, more than half a mile.\"\r\n\r\nHis journal for a year is filled with similar details, and would be a\r\nmelancholy narration were it not that it exhibits him under every\r\nvicissitude, suspected and watched by the French government,\r\nmisrepresented by the representatives of his own country, treated with\r\nalmost universal coldness and neglect, cut off from all communication\r\nwith America, without money, without occupation, and without any\r\nreasonable hope of a termination of his troubles, uniformly composed,\r\nfirm, and cheerful. Not a discontented or fretful expression is to be\r\nfound in his voluminous memoranda.\r\n\r\nAt length, in July, 1811, a ship being about sailing in ballast for\r\nAmerica, with Napoleon's permission, Colonel Burr, through the\r\ninfluence of the Duc de Bassano, received permission to leave Paris.\r\nHe arrived at Amsterdam on the 3d of August; and after a month's\r\ndelay, apparently from the capricious tyranny of the French\r\nauthorities, he sailed for America in the ship Vigilant on the 20th of\r\nSeptember; and, escaping from the toils of one of the great\r\nbelligerants, he fell into the power of the other, and was on the next\r\nday captured by an English frigate and carried into Yarmouth.\r\n\r\nThe Vigilant and the effects of her passengers were taken possession\r\nof by the government for trial in the admiralty; and as Burr had paid\r\nfor passage to America, and was reduced very low in funds, he was\r\nobliged to remain in England. He continued in England from the 9th of\r\nOctober, 1811, till the 6th of March, 1812, when he sailed for America\r\nin the ship Aurora, and arrived in New-York, via Boston, on the 8th of\r\nJune, 1812, just four years after his departure from America. During\r\nhis second sojourn in England he enjoyed the society and friendship of\r\nBentham and Godwin; but the latter could not alleviate his pecuniary\r\ndistress, and the former was probably never fully aware of it. The\r\ndiary contains a protracted record of privations, sometimes\r\nthreatening absolute and hopeless want, but endured throughout with\r\nundisturbed and characteristic fortitude and gayety. He seems to have\r\nmissed the attentions and society which he found on his first visit to\r\nLondon, and the following extract from his journal of 26th March,\r\n1812, shows that he left England without feeling affection or regret.\r\n\r\n\"I shake the dust off my feet. Adieu, John Bull! Insula\r\ninhospitabilis, as you were truly called 1800 years ago.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n1. It is highly probable that portions of Colonel Burr's journal, with\r\nhis correspondence while in Europe, may hereafter be published in a\r\nsingle volume, as a separate and distinct work.\r\n\r\n2. Joseph Alston, son-in-law of Colonel Burr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nImmediately after Colonel Burr's arrival in the city of New-York, he\r\nopened an office and commenced the practice of law. The high and\r\ndistinguished reputation with which he had retired from the bar in\r\n1801 secured to him, on his return, an extensive and profitable\r\nbusiness. A few individuals of the profession, under the influence of\r\nformer prejudices, some of them hereditary, and as ancient as the 4th\r\nof July, 1776, endeavoured to throw impediments in his way; but these\r\nefforts were of short duration, and productive of but little effect.\r\nIn general, he was courteously, if not kindly received, by gentlemen\r\nof the profession. In reference to this subject it was his request,\r\nthat while no individual should be censured, the name of his friend,\r\nColonel Robert Troup, should be recorded as meriting and receiving his\r\nmost grateful acknowledgments. It has been seen that their intimacy\r\nwas formed while they were yet but boys, at a period and under\r\ncircumstances \"that tried men's souls.\" On Burr's opening his office,\r\nColonel Troup, having abandoned the practice of law, generously\r\ntendered him the use of his library until it should be required for\r\nhis (Troup's) own son; which, to Burr, was a most acceptable kindness,\r\nas he was destitute of the means of supplying even his most pressing\r\nwants. His prospects, for the moment, were cheering and auspicious.\r\nBut they were soon \"o'er-clouded with wo.\"\r\n\r\nIn his daughter (Mrs. Alston) and her son were centred all his hopes,\r\nall his affections, all the ties that bound him to this life. The\r\nfollowing appears to have been the first letter, after his arrival in\r\nthe United States, that Burr received from his son-in-law Alston.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM JOSEPH ALSTON.\r\n\r\nJuly 26, 1812.\r\n\r\nA few miserable weeks since, my dear sir, and in spite of all the\r\nembarrassments, the troubles, and disappointments which have fallen to\r\nour lot since we parted, I would have congratulated you on your return\r\nin the language of happiness. With my wife on one side and my boy on\r\nthe other, I felt myself superior to depression. The present was\r\nenjoyed, the future was anticipated with enthusiasm. One dreadful blow\r\nhas destroyed us; reduced us to the veriest, the most sublimated\r\nwretchedness. That boy, on whom all rested; our companion, our\r\nfriend--he who was to have transmitted down the mingled blood of\r\nTheodosia and myself--he who was to have redeemed all your glory, and\r\nshed new lustre upon our families--that boy, at once our happiness and\r\nour pride, is taken from us--_is dead_. We saw him dead. My own hand\r\nsurrendered him to the grave; yet we are alive. But it is past. I will\r\nnot conceal from you that life is a burden, which, heavy as it is, we\r\nshall both support, if not with dignity, at least with decency and\r\nfirmness. Theodosia has endured all that a human being could endure;\r\nbut her admirable mind will triumph. She supports herself in a manner\r\nworthy of your daughter.\r\n\r\nWe have not yet been able to form any definite plan of life. My\r\npresent wish is that Theodosia should join you, with or without me, as\r\nsoon as possible. My command here, as brigadier-general, embarrasses\r\nme a good deal in the disposal of _myself._ I would part with\r\nTheodosia reluctantly; but if I find myself detained here, I shall\r\ncertainly do so. I not only recognise your claim to her after such a\r\nseparation, but change of scene and your society will aid her, I am\r\nconscious, in recovering at least that tone of mind which we are\r\ndestined to carry through life with us.\r\n\r\nI have great anxiety to be employed against Quebec, should an army be\r\nordered thither, and have letters prepared asking of the president a\r\nbrigade in that army. From the support which that request will have,\r\nif not obtained now, I doubt not it will be at the first increase of\r\nthe military force, which, if the war be seriously carried on, must be\r\nas soon as Congress meet. Then, be the event what it may, I shall at\r\nleast gain something. Adieu.\r\n\r\nYours, with respect and regard,\r\n\r\nJOSEPH ALSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe effect upon Burr of this blow may be imagined by those who have\r\nnoticed his constant and unceasing anxiety for his grandson, Aaron\r\nBurr Alston. In his intercourse, however, with the world, and in his\r\nbusiness pursuits, there was a promptitude and an apparent\r\ncheerfulness which seemed to indicate a tranquillity of mind. But not\r\nso in his lone and solitary hours. When in the society of a single\r\nfriend, if an accidental reference was made to the event, the manly\r\ntear would be seen slowly stealing down his furrowed cheek, until, as\r\nif awakening from a slumber, he would suddenly check those emotions of\r\nthe heart, and all would again become subdued, calm, dignified.\r\n\r\nDuring this autumn (1812) Theodosia's health continued to be\r\nprecarious. Deep-settled grief, in addition to her protracted disease,\r\nwas rapidly wasting her away. She continued to correspond with her\r\nfather; but at length, in November, it was determined that she should\r\njoin him in New-York. A few short extracts of letters will unfold and\r\nclose this melancholy tale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM TIMOTHY GREEN.\r\n\r\nCharleston, S. C., December 7, 1812.\r\n\r\nI arrived here from New-York on the 28th ult., and on the 29th started\r\nfor Columbia. Mr. Alston seemed rather hurt that you should conceive\r\nit necessary to send a person here, as he or one of his brothers would\r\nattend Mrs. Alston to New-York. I told him you had some opinion of my\r\nmedical talents; that you had learned your daughter was in a low state\r\nof health, and required unusual attention, and medical attention on\r\nher voyage; that I had torn myself from my family to perform this\r\nservice for my friend. He said that he was inclined to charter a\r\nvessel to take her on. I informed him that I should return to\r\nCharleston, where I should remain a day or two, and then proceed to\r\nGeorgetown (S. C.) and wait his arrival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorgetown, S. C., December 22, 1812.\r\n\r\nI have engaged a passage to New-York for your daughter in a pilot-boat\r\nthat has been out privateering, but has come in here, and is refitting\r\nmerely to get to New-York. My only fears are that Governor Alston may\r\nthink the mode of conveyance too undignified, and object to it; but\r\nMrs. Alston is fully bent on going. You must not be surprised to see\r\nher very low, feeble, and emaciated. Her complaint is an almost\r\nincessant nervous fever. We shall sail in about eight days.\r\n\r\nTIMOTHY GREEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM JOSEPH ALSTON TO THEODOSIA.\r\n\r\nColumbia, S. C., January 15, 1813.\r\n\r\nAnother mail, and still no letter! I hear, too, rumours of a gale off\r\nCape Hatteras the beginning of the month! The state of my mind is\r\ndreadful. Let no man, wretched as he may be, presume to think himself\r\nbeyond the reach of another blow. I shall count the hours till noon\r\nto-morrow. If I do not hear then, there will be no hope till Tuesday.\r\nTo feelings like mine, what an interval! May God grant me one word\r\nfrom you to-morrow. Adieu. All that I have left of heart is yours. All\r\nmy prayers are for your safety and well-being.\r\n\r\nJanuary 19, 1813.\r\n\r\nForebodings! wretched, heart-rending forebodings distract my mind. I\r\nmay no longer have a wife; and yet my impatient restlessness addresses\r\nher a letter. To-morrow will be three weeks since our separation, and\r\nnot yet one line. Gracious God! for what am I reserved?\r\n\r\nJOSEPH ALSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM JOSEPH ALSTON TO COL. BURR.\r\n\r\nColumbia, January 19, 1813.\r\n\r\nTo-morrow will be three weeks since, in obedience to your wishes,\r\nTheodosia left me. It is three weeks, and not yet one line from her.\r\nMy mind is tortured. I wrote you on the 29th ult., the day before\r\nTheo. sailed, that on the next day she would embark in the privateer\r\n_Patriot_, a pilot-boat-built schooner, commanded by Captain\r\nOverstocks, with an old New-York pilot as sailing-master. The vessel\r\nhad dismissed her crew, and was returning home with her guns under\r\ndeck. Her reputed swiftness in sailing inspired such confidence of a\r\nvoyage of not more than five or six days, that the three weeks without\r\na letter fill me with an unhappiness--a wretchedness I can neither\r\ndescribe nor conquer. Gracious God! Is my wife, too, taken from me? I\r\ndo not know why I write, but I feel that I am miserable.\r\n\r\nCharleston, January 31, 1813.\r\n\r\nA call of business to this place for a few days occasioned your letter\r\nof the 20th not to be received till this morning. Not a moment is lost\r\nin replying to it. Yet wherefore? You ask of me to relieve your\r\nsuspense. Alas! it was to you I looked for similar relief. I have\r\nwritten you twice since my letter of December 29. I can add nothing to\r\nthe information then given. I parted with our Theo. near the bar about\r\nnoon on Thursday, the last of December. The wind was moderate and\r\nfair. She was in the pilot-boat-built schooner Patriot, Captain\r\nOverstocks, with an experienced New-York pilot, Coon, as\r\nsailing-master. This vessel, the same which had been sent by\r\ngovernment last summer in pursuit of Commodore Rodgers's squadron, had\r\nbeen selected as one which, from her reputed excellence and swiftness\r\nin sailing, would ensure a passage of not more than five or six days.\r\nFrom that moment I have heard nothing of the schooner nor my wife. I\r\nhave been the prey of feelings which you only can imagine. When I\r\nturned from the grave of my boy I deemed myself no longer vulnerable.\r\nMisfortune had no more a blow for me. I was wrong. It is true, I no\r\nlonger feel, I never shall feel as I was wont; but I have been taught\r\nthat there was still one being in whom I was inexpressibly interested.\r\nI have in vain endeavoured to build upon the hope of long passage.\r\nThirty days are decisive. My wife is _either captured or lost_. What a\r\ndestiny is mine! and I live under it, engage in business, appear to\r\nthe world as though all was tranquil, easy. 'Tis so, but it cannot\r\nendure. A short time since, and the idea of capture would have been\r\nthe source of painful, terrible apprehension; it now furnishes me the\r\nonly ray of comfort, or rather of hope, that I have. Each mail is\r\nanticipated with impatient, yet fearful and appalling anxiety. Should\r\nyou hear aught relative to the object of this our common solicitude,\r\ndo not, I pray, forget me.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH ALSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM JOSEPH ALSTON.\r\n\r\nFebruary 25, 1813.\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 10th, my friend, is received. This assurance of my\r\nfate was not wanting. Authentic accounts from Bermuda and Nassau, as\r\nlate as January 30, connected with your letter from New-York of the\r\n28th, had already forced upon me the dreadful conviction that we had\r\nno more to hope. Without this victim, too, the desolation would not\r\nhave been complete. My boy--my wife--gone, both! This, then, is the\r\nend of all the hopes we had formed. You may well observe that you feel\r\nsevered from the human race. She was the last tie that bound us to the\r\nspecies. What have we left? In surviving the 30th of June [1] I\r\nthought I could meet all other afflictions with ease, yet I have\r\nstaggered under this in a manner that I am glad had not a witness.\r\nYour letter of January 28 was not received till February 9. The Oaks,\r\nfor some months visited only at intervals, when the feelings the world\r\nthought gone by were not to be controlled, was the asylum I sought. It\r\nwas there, in the chamber of my wife, where every thing was disposed\r\nas usual; with the clothes, the books, the play-things of my boy\r\naround me, that I sustained this second shock, doubled in a manner\r\nthat I could not account for. My son seemed to have been reanimated,\r\nto have been restored to me, and to have just perished again with his\r\nmother. It was the loss of both pressing upon me at the same moment.\r\n\r\nShould it be my misfortune to live a Century, the 30th of June and the\r\n10th of February are so impressed upon my mind that they will always\r\nseem to have just passed. I visited the grave of my boy. The little\r\nplans we had all three formed rushed upon my memory. Where now was the\r\nboy? The mother I cherished with so much pride? I felt like the very\r\nspirit of desolation. If it had not been for a kind of stupefaction\r\nand confusion of mind which followed, God knows how I should have\r\nborne it. Oh, my friend, if there be such a thing as the sublime of\r\nmisery, it is for us that it has been reserved.\r\n\r\nYou are the only person in the world with whom I can commune on this\r\nsubject; for you are the only person whose feelings can have any\r\ncommunity with mine. You knew those we loved. With you, therefore, it\r\nwill be no weakness to feel their loss. Here, none knew them; none\r\nvalued them as they deserved. The talents of my boy, his rare\r\nelevation of character, his already extensive reputation for so early\r\nan age, made his death regretted by the pride of my family; but,\r\nthough certain of the loss of my not less admirable wife, they seem to\r\nconsider it like the loss of an ordinary woman. Alas! they know\r\nnothing of my heart. They never have known any thing of it. Yet, after\r\nall, he is a poor actor who cannot sustain his little hour upon the\r\nstage, be his part what it may. But the man who has been deemed worthy\r\nof the heart of _Theodosia Burr_, and who has felt what it was to be\r\nblessed with such a woman's, will never forget his elevation.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH ALSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis distressing correspondence between Colonel Burr and Governor\r\nAlston was continued during the year 1813; but the unfortunate\r\nTheodosia was never again heard of, except in idle rumours and\r\nexaggerated tales of her capture and murder by pirates. These reports,\r\nit is believed, were without foundation. The schooner on board which\r\nshe had taken passage probably foundered, and every soul perished in a\r\nheavy gale which was experienced along our whole coast a few days\r\nafter her departure from Georgetown.\r\n\r\nColonel Burr, on his return to the United States, mingled but little\r\nin society. He only knew those who first recognised him. In the\r\nordinary conflicts of the political parties of the day he seemed to\r\nfeel but little interest, and rarely interfered. From them he sought\r\nneither honour nor emolument. He pursued his profession, however, with\r\ngreat ardour and some success; but was continually embarrassed, and\r\nsometimes experienced great difficulty from the pressure of his old\r\ndebts. The following extract will afford some general idea of his\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH ALSTON.\r\n\r\nNew-York, October 16, 1815.\r\n\r\nI have found it so difficult to answer that part of your letter which\r\nregards myself and my concerns, that it has been deferred, though\r\noften in my mind. At some other time I may give you, in detail, a\r\nsketch of the sad period which has elapsed since my return. For the\r\npresent, it will suffice to say that my business affords me a decent\r\nsupport. If I had not been interrupted in the career which I began, I\r\nshould, before this, have paid all my debts and been at ease.\r\n\r\nMy old creditors (principally the holders of the Mexican debts) came\r\nupon me last winter with vindictive fury. I was held to bail in large\r\nsums, and saw no probability of keeping out of prison for six months.\r\nThis danger is still menacing, but not quite so imminent. I shall\r\nneither borrow nor receive from any one, not even from you. I have\r\ndetermined not to begin to pay unless I see a prospect of paying all.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen any great political question agitated the country, such as a\r\npresidential election, Mr. Burr seemed to feel it his duty to express\r\nhis opinion to those whom he supposed confided in his discernment or\r\nhis patriotism. On these occasions he spake with great freedom and\r\nboldness. Many of his letters exhibit all that sagacity and talent for\r\nwhich he was so pre-eminently distinguished. It has been seen by the\r\nextract from Blennerhassett's private journal, that he did not\r\ncomplain in 1807 of any act done by General Andrew Jackson. The\r\nfollowing will show that he remained under the influence of similar\r\nfeelings in 1815.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR JOSEPH ALSTON.\r\n\r\nNew-York, November 20, 1815.\r\n\r\nA congressional caucus will, in the course of the ensuing month,\r\nnominate James Monroe for President of the United States, and will\r\ncall on all good republicans to support the nomination.\r\n\r\nWhether we consider the measure itself, the character and talents of\r\nthe man, or the state whence he comes, this nomination is equally\r\nexceptionable and odious.\r\n\r\nI have often heard your opinion of these congressional nominations.\r\nThey are hostile to all freedom and independence of suffrage. A\r\ncertain junto of actual and factitious Virginians, having had\r\npossession of the government for twenty-four years, consider the\r\nUnited States as their property, and, by bawling \"Support the\r\nAdministration,\" have so long succeeded in duping the republican\r\npublic. One of their principal arts, and which has been systematically\r\ntaught by Jefferson, is that of promoting state dissensions, not\r\nbetween republican and federal--that would do them no good--but\r\nschisms in the republican party. By looking round you will see how the\r\nattention of leading men in the different states has thus been turned\r\nfrom general and _state_ politics. Let not this disgraceful domination\r\ncontinue.\r\n\r\nIndependently of the manner of the nomination and the location of the\r\ncandidate, the man himself is one of the most improper and incompetent\r\nthat could be selected. Naturally dull and stupid; extremely\r\nilliterate; indecisive to a degree that would be incredible to one who\r\ndid not know him; pusillanimous, and, of course, hypocritical; has no\r\nopinion on any subject, and will be always under the government of the\r\nworst men; pretends, as I am told, to some knowledge of military\r\nmatters, but never commanded a platoon, nor was ever fit to command\r\none. \"_He served in the Revolutionary War!_\"--that is, he acted a\r\nshort time as aid-de-camp to Lord Stirling, who was regularly\r\n********. Monroe's whole duty was to fill his lordship's tankard, and\r\nhear, with indications of admiration, his lordship's long stories\r\nabout himself. Such is Monroe's military experience. I was with my\r\nregiment in the same division at the time. As a lawyer, Monroe was far\r\nbelow mediocrity.\r\n\r\nHe never rose to the honour of trying a cause of the value of a\r\nhundred pounds. This is a character exactly suited to the views of the\r\nVirginia junto.\r\n\r\nTo this junto you have twice sacrificed yourself, and what have you\r\ngot by it? Their hatred and abhorrence. Did you ever know them to\r\ncountenance a man of talents and independence? Never--nor ever will.\r\n\r\nIt is time that you manifested that you had some individual character;\r\nsome opinion of your own; some influence to support that opinion. Make\r\nthem fear you, and they will be at your feet. Thus far they have\r\nreason to believe that you fear them.\r\n\r\nThe moment is extremely auspicious for breaking down this degrading\r\nsystem. The best citizens of our country acknowledge the feebleness of\r\nour administration. They acknowledge that offices are bestowed merely\r\nto preserve power, and without the smallest regard to fitness. If,\r\nthen, there be a man in the United States of firmness and decision,\r\nand having standing enough to afford even a hope of success, it is\r\nyour duty to hold him up to public view: that man is _Andrew Jackson_.\r\nNothing is wanting but a respectable nomination, made before the\r\nproclamation of the Virginia caucus, and _Jackson's_ success is\r\ninevitable.\r\n\r\nIf this project should accord with your views, I could wish to see\r\n_you_ prominent in the execution of it. It must be known to be _your_\r\nwork. Whether a formal and open nomination should now be made, or\r\nwhether you should, for the present, content yourself with barely\r\ndenouncing, by a joint resolution of both houses of your legislature,\r\ncongressional caucuses and nominations, you only can judge. One\r\nconsideration inclines me to hesitate about the policy of a present\r\nnomination. It is this--that Jackson ought first to be admonished to\r\nbe passive: for, the moment he shall be announced as a candidate, he\r\nwill be assailed by the Virginia junto with menaces, and with\r\ninsidious promises of boons and favours. _There is danger that Jackson\r\nmight be wrought upon by such practices_. If an open nomination be\r\nmade, an express should be instantly sent to him.\r\n\r\nThis suggestion has not arisen from any exclusive attachment to\r\nJackson. The object is to break down this vile combination which rules\r\nand degrades the United States. If you should think that any other man\r\ncould be held up with better prospect of success, name that man. I\r\nknow of no such. But the business must be accomplished, and on this\r\noccasion, and by you. So long as the present system prevails, you will\r\nbe struggling against wind and tide to preserve a precarious\r\ninfluence. You will never be forgiven for the crime of having talents\r\nand independence.\r\n\r\nExhibit yourself, then, and emerge from this state of nullity. You owe\r\nit to yourself, you owe it to me, you owe it to your country, you owe\r\nit to the memory of the dead.\r\n\r\nI have talked of this matter to your late secretary, but he has not\r\nseen this letter.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\nYour secretary was to have delivered this personally, but has changed\r\nhis course on hearing that Jackson is on his way to Washington. If you\r\nshould have any confidential friend among the members of Congress from\r\nyour state, charge him to caution Jackson against the perfidious\r\ncaresses with which he will be overwhelmed at Washington.\r\n\r\nA. B.\r\n\r\nNew-York, December 11, 1815.\r\n\r\nA copy of the preceding went under cover to Dr. Wragg. Since that date\r\nthings are wonderfully advanced, as your secretary will write or tell\r\nyou. These will require a written message (letter) from yourself and\r\nothers (or yourself alone, but three names would look more formal),\r\nadvising Jackson what is doing; that communications have been had with\r\nthe Northern states, requiring him only to be passive, and asking from\r\nhim a list of persons in the Western states to whom you may address\r\nyour letters.\r\n\r\nA. BURR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM JOSEPH ALSTON.\r\n\r\nCharleston, February 16, 1816.\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 20th of November, entrusted to Mr. Phillips, was\r\nreceived through the postoffice about the middle of last month. It\r\nwas, of course, too late, had circumstances been ever so favourable,\r\nto be acted upon in the manner proposed. Had it even been received,\r\nhowever, in due season, it would have found me utterly incapable of\r\nexertion. On my way to Columbia, in November, I had another severe\r\nattack of illness, which rendered absolutely impracticable either the\r\nimmediate prosecution of my journey or my attendance during the\r\nsession of the legislature. As soon as I was able to bear the motion\r\nof a carriage, I was brought by short stages to this place, where I\r\nhave been confined ever since. Yesterday was the first time for two\r\nmonths that I have been out of the house. So much for the miserable\r\nremnant of myself.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the subject of your letter of the 20th of November, I\r\nfully coincide with you in sentiment; but the spirit, the energy, the\r\nhealth necessary to give practical effect to sentiment, are all gone.\r\nI feel too much alone, too entirely unconnected with the world, to\r\ntake much interest in any thing. Yet, without the smallest solicitude\r\nabout the result, I shall certainly not fail to discharge my public\r\nduty, whenever the opportunity occurs, by giving a very strong and\r\nfrank expression of my opinion on the subject suggested.\r\n\r\nVanderlyn, I perceive from the papers, has returned to New-York.\r\nNothing, I trust, has prevented his bringing back the portrait [2] you\r\nleft with him. Let me again entreat you to use your influence with him\r\nin procuring me a good copy. I received some days since, through the\r\nkindness of Mr. John B. Prevost, a miniature, which appears to have\r\nbeen taken from Vanderlyn's portrait. The execution is good, but in\r\nexpression it is by no means equal to the portrait. There was a small\r\nportrait of Natalie which you took with you, of which, if Vanderlyn\r\nembraces that kind of painting in his present plan, I should be glad\r\nalso to obtain of him a copy. The original picture, I think, was the\r\nbest portrait I ever saw.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately,\r\n\r\nJOSEPH ALSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this depressed state of mind and debilitated state of body Governor\r\nAlston remained until summer, when he died. Whatever may have been\r\nappearances to the contrary, it is highly probable that, after the\r\ndeath of his son and wife, he never enjoyed happiness. Their loss\r\ncontinually preyed upon him. To Colonel Burr, and, it would seem, to\r\nhim alone, he unbosomed himself. All his letters breathe a deep and\r\nsettled gloom, bordering on despondency--a gloom which time could not\r\nsubdue or change.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM WILLIAM A. ALSTON.\r\n\r\nRosehill, near Georgetown, October 4, 1916.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nIt was enjoined on me, and my brother John A. Alston, verbally, by our\r\nlate brother Joseph Alston, to send a certain trunk to you, which he\r\nnever had the courage to open, containing, as he said, some things\r\nthat belonged to your daughter Theodosia; and to send a certain\r\ncollection of other articles (of dress, I believe), that had also been\r\nhers, to the eldest daughter of Mr. J. B. Prevost. Pray point you out\r\nthe way, sir, in which our trust is to be executed.\r\n\r\nIn his will, of which a copy shall be sent you if desired, my brother\r\nhas given all demands up to you that he had against you. Very\r\nrespectfully,\r\n\r\nWILLIAM A. ALSTON.\r\n\r\nP. S. These are alone the words relating to you in the will: \"To my\r\nfather-in-law, Aaron Burr, I give, devise, and bequeath all demands I\r\nmay have against him, whether by judgment or otherwise.\"\r\n\r\nThe trunk and other articles above referred to were subsequently\r\ntransmitted to Colonel Burr. Among the private papers of Theodosia\r\nthere are some fragments and scraps of much interest. In the summer of\r\n1805 she was dangerously ill, and she appears, from the following\r\nletter, to have been greatly depressed in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THEODOSIA TO JOSEPH ALSTON.\r\n\r\nAugust 6, 1805.\r\n\r\nWhether it is the effect of extreme debility and disordered nerves, or\r\nwhether it is really presentiment, the existence of which I have been\r\noften told of, and always doubted, I cannot tell; but something\r\nwhispers me that my end approaches. In vain I reason with myself; in\r\nvain I occupy my mind, and seek to fix my attention on other subjects\r\n; there is about me that dreadful heaviness and sinking of the heart,\r\nthat awful foreboding, of which it is impossible to divest myself.\r\nPerhaps I am now standing on the brink of eternity; and, ere I plunge\r\nin the fearful abyss, I have some few requests to make.\r\n\r\nI wish your sisters (one of them, it is immaterial which) would select\r\nfrom my clothes certain things which they will easily perceive\r\nbelonged to my mother. These, with whatever lace they find in a large\r\ntrunk in a garret-room of the Oaks house, added to a little satinwood\r\nbox (the largest, and having a lock and key), and a black satin\r\nembroidered box, with a pincushion; all these things I wish they would\r\nput together in one trunk, and send them to Frederic, with the\r\nenclosed letter. I prefer him, because Bartow's wife would have little\r\nrespect for what, however trifling it may appear, I nevertheless deem\r\nsacred.\r\n\r\nI beg Sister Maria will accept of my watch-ring. She will find a\r\nlocket which she gave me, containing the hair of her mother; she had\r\nbetter take it. If the lace in my wardrobe at the Oaks will be of any\r\nuse to Charlotte, I beg she will take it, or any thing else she\r\nwishes. My heart is with those dear amiable sisters, to give them\r\nsomething worth preserving in recollection of me; but they know that a\r\nwarm friendship is all I have to give.\r\n\r\nReturn to mamma the eagle she gave me. Should an opportunity to\r\nCatharine Brown ever occur, send her a pearl necklace, a small diamond\r\nring, a little pair of coral tablets, which are among my trinkets at\r\nthe Oaks. I pray you, my dear husband, send Bartow's daughter some\r\npresent for me, and to himself and Frederic a lock of my hair. Return\r\nNatalie the little desk she gave me, accompanied by assurances of my\r\naffectionate recollection, and a ring of my hair. Remember me to\r\nSally, who is truly amiable, and whom I sincerely esteem.\r\n\r\nI beg, also, you will write immediately to New-York, for warding some\r\nmoney for the comfortable support of _Peggy_ until my father can\r\nprovide for her. Do not permit grief at the loss of me to render you\r\nforgetful of this, for the poor creature may expire of want in the\r\nmean time. I beg this may be attended to without delay.\r\n\r\nTo you, my beloved, I leave our child; the child of my bosom, who was\r\nonce a part of myself, and from whom I shall shortly be separated by\r\nthe cold grave. You love him now; henceforth love him for me also. And\r\noh, my husband, attend to this last prayer of a doting mother. Never,\r\nnever listen to what any other person tells you of him. Be yourself\r\nhis judge on all occasions. He has faults; see them, and correct them\r\nyourself. Desist not an instant from your endeavours to secure his\r\nconfidence. It is a work which requires as much uniformity of conduct\r\nas warmth of affection towards him. I know, my beloved, that you can\r\nperceive what is right on this subject as on every other. But\r\nrecollect, these are the last words I can ever utter. It will\r\ntranquillize my last moments to have disburdened myself of them.\r\n\r\nI fear you will scarcely be able to read this scrawl, but I feel\r\nhurried and agitated. Death is not welcome to me. I confess it is ever\r\ndreaded. You have made me too fond of life. Adieu, then, thou kind,\r\nthou tender husband. Adieu, friend of my heart. May Heaven prosper\r\nyou, and may we meet hereafter. Adieu; perhaps we may never see each\r\nother again in this world. You are away, I wished to hold you fast,\r\nand prevented you from going this morning. But He who is wisdom itself\r\nordains events; we must submit to them. Least of all should I murmur.\r\nI, on whom so many blessings have been showered--whose days have been\r\nnumbered by bounties--who have had such a husband, such a child, and\r\nsuch a father. Oh pardon me, my God, if I regret leaving these. I\r\nresign myself. Adieu, once more, and for the last time, my beloved.\r\nSpeak of me often to our son. Let him love the memory of his mother,\r\nand let him know how he was loved by her. Your wife, your fond wife,\r\n\r\nTHEO.\r\n\r\nLet my father see my son sometimes. Do not be unkind towards him whom\r\nI have loved so much, I beseech you. Burn all my papers except my\r\nfather's letters, which I beg you to return him. Adieu, my sweet boy.\r\nLove your father; be grateful and affectionate to him while he lives;\r\nbe the pride of his meridian, the support of his departing days. Be\r\nall that he wishes; for he made your mother happy. Oh! my heavenly\r\nFather, bless them both. If it is permitted, I will hover round you,\r\nand guard you, and intercede for you. I hope for happiness in the next\r\nworld, for I have not been bad in this.\r\n\r\nI had nearly forgotten to say that I charge you not to allow me to be\r\nstripped and washed, as is usual. I am pure enough thus to return to\r\ndust. Why, then, expose my person? Pray see to this. If it does not\r\nappear contradictory or silly, I beg to be kept as long as possible\r\nbefore I am consigned to the earth.\r\n\r\n[Directed--\"_My husband_. To be delivered after my death. I wish this\r\nto be read _immediately_, and before my burial.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Colonel Burr seldom interfered in the politics of his own\r\ncountry, yet he continued to feel a deep and abiding interest in the\r\nemancipation of South America. He was constantly projecting some\r\nmeasure which in his opinion was calculated to promote this object. He\r\nencouraged the friends of freedom in that benighted land. He\r\ncorresponded with those who were connected with any enterprise\r\nfavouring the revolution, and consulted and advised with all who\r\nvisited the United States, and sought his advice on the subject. The\r\nfollowing letter will show the wishes of distinguished Mexicans in the\r\nyear 1816.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM GENERAL TOLEDO.\r\n\r\nTRANSLATION.\r\n\r\nNew-York, September 20, 1816.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nAlthough I have not the honour of knowing you personally, the\r\nreputation of your talents and good wishes for the cause of America\r\nhave made your name familiar among us; and since this will dispense\r\nthe accustomed forms of introduction, I dare present to your\r\nconsideration the actual state of our revolution, our evils, and the\r\nremedies which we believe may be applied to them.\r\n\r\nIt is six years since that, almost simultaneously, the standard of\r\nliberty was raised by different provinces of Spanish America, and the\r\ncry of independence was heard from the territory of Mexico to the\r\nextremities of Chili. The inhabitants, determined to resist their\r\nEuropean oppressors, formed themselves in groups under the name of\r\narmies, and placed at the head of them persons of the first\r\nreputation. Hundreds of battles have been fought, decided solely by\r\ndint of valour, without the assistance of military art or skill; the\r\nyouth and most illustrious families have been sacrificed, and even\r\nentire populations have disappeared in a struggle so just, but\r\nunfortunately conducted with inaptitude or marked with cruelty.\r\n\r\nI, among others, have been honoured with the confidence of the command\r\nof the Mexican troops; and at the close of so many sacrifices we have\r\nonly come to a knowledge of the character of the people and of\r\nourselves. Both are well disposed, and there is only wanting, to\r\ncomplete our wishes, that these dispositions be directed with\r\ncalculation and wisdom for the public good.\r\n\r\nMy voyage to this country has for its object not only to obtain the\r\nmeans for continuing the war, but to seek the person best capable of\r\nemploying them. This is the desire of that people; and I can assure\r\nyou that their wish and mine would be satisfied at the same time, if\r\nwe should have the fortune of your assuming the management of our\r\npolitical and military affairs in the dangerous crisis in which we\r\nfind ourselves.\r\n\r\nI hope that, in behalf of the cause of America and of humanity, you\r\nwill accept this offer, which I have the honour to make you in the\r\nname of that people, and\r\n\r\nI am, sir,\r\n\r\nWith the greatest respect and consideration,\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\nJOSE ALVAREZ DE TOLEDO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe invitation of General Toledo was not accepted. Colonel Burr,\r\nhowever, continued to act with his accustomed zeal in behalf of the\r\nSouth American patriots; and in 1819 the Republic of Venezuela granted\r\nhim the following commission:--\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATION.\r\n\r\nRepublic of Venezuela, Palace of the Governor, Angostura, October 9,\r\n1819.\r\n\r\nJohn Baptiste Arismendi, of the Order of Liberators,\r\n\r\nCaptain-general of the Armies, and Vice-president of the State, &c.,\r\n&c., &c.\r\n\r\nWhereas Aaron Burr, citizen of the United States of North America, has\r\nproved, to the satisfaction of this government, his ardent love for\r\nthe cause of liberty and independence, and his desire to be actively\r\nemployed in its service, as one most worthy of a freeman and a\r\nphilanthropist, and most glorious for an American who has fought for\r\nthe rights of his native land:\r\n\r\nTherefore, in compliance with his (noble) praiseworthy wishes, and in\r\nfulfilment of a duty imposed upon me by the absence of the president\r\nof the republic in the territory of New Grenada, and impressed with\r\nthe necessity of rendering assistance to all other countries of South\r\nAmerica and Mexico now contending against the civil and religious\r\ntyranny of the Spanish government,\r\n\r\nI hereby authorize the above-named Aaron Burr (without violation of\r\nestablished laws and customs) to raise troops for sea and land\r\nservice, to aid this government or any other now struggling in the\r\nsame cause against the despotism of Spain; provided that, in thus\r\ncontending against the common enemy, he conform to established\r\nordinances, the laws of nations, and the acknowledged usages among\r\ncountries that aspire to emancipation and liberty.\r\n\r\nAnd I declare that, it not being possible to organize _gratuitously_\r\nnaval or land expeditions in all parts of the country, the property\r\ntaken from the enemy being insufficient to defray the expenses, this\r\nrepublic and any other that may be benefited or assisted by the said\r\nAaron Burr shall hold their funds responsible for any debts contracted\r\nby him in the premises.\r\n\r\nTherefore, that he may proceed with that order which the exigence of\r\nthe case requires, the _\"commissioned\"_ (A. B.) shall render an\r\naccount, and advise of all contracts entered into by him in the\r\nfulfilment of his commission, in order that they may be examined and\r\napproved in anticipation (of payment). But it will be understood that\r\nthe government is unable at this time to pay its troops regularly; and\r\nthe latter will not be justified in relying on any thing more than a\r\nbare subsistence or an occasional provision, more or less, according\r\nto circumstances. This notice to be given to _all_ enlisting under his\r\nbanners. This measure is rendered necessary, lest the good faith of\r\nthe government should be compromised. An account of all military\r\nstipends will be kept by the government, that they may be liquidated\r\nin proportion to the increase of its resources. The republic exacts\r\nthis service only during the continuance of the war. At its\r\ntermination each soldier shall receive as a bounty a landed estate of\r\nthe value of five hundred dollars; and all officers shall be paid in\r\nproportion, in conformity with the provisions of the law, or the\r\ndecree for the division of national property, in addition to the\r\npersonal rights with which the gratitude of Venezuela constitutionally\r\nrecognises the services performed in its cause.\r\n\r\nAnd that the above-named Aaron Burr may legally exert himself in\r\nfavour of the emancipation and liberty of Venezuela and New Grenada,\r\nand all other countries of South America and Mexico now contending\r\nagainst the arbitrary and oppressive power of Spain, without in any\r\nmanner giving offence to friendly or neutral powers, so long as they\r\nshall preserve their amity and neutrality, I grant to him this\r\ncommission, signed with my hand, sealed with the provisional seal of\r\nthe republic, and countersigned by the secretary of state and foreign\r\naffairs, in the place, day, month, and year above named.\r\n\r\nJ. BAPTISTE ARISMENDI.\r\n\r\n(Seal)\r\n\r\nJUAN G. ROSCW, Secretary of State and F.A.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was thus that Colonel Burr was employed after his return from\r\nEurope until near the close of his life. During his leisure hours, if\r\nany such he had, his mind was occupied for several years in directing\r\nthe education of two young ladies (Misses Eden) who were his wards,\r\nand for whom, in a protracted lawsuit, he had recovered a valuable\r\nestate. His regular and constant correspondence with these ladies,\r\npointing out their errors, their improvements, and the studies which\r\nthey were to pursue from day to day, was to them invaluable, and well\r\ncalculated to \"teach the young idea how to shoot.\" Copies of these\r\nletters are preserved, and it was originally intended to have\r\npublished portions of them in this work, but no space remains. They\r\nwould form a pleasing and interesting treatise on female education.\r\n\r\nAlthough Colonel Burr's pecuniary means were limited, yet he was not\r\ndestitute. He had an annual income of a few hundred dollars, in\r\naddition to his half-pay as a colonel in the revolutionary army. For\r\ntwo or three years before his death he suffered under the effects of a\r\nparalysis. Much of the time he was in a measure helpless, so far as\r\nlocomotion was concerned. His general health, however, was tolerably\r\ngood, by using great precaution in his diet. He had long abstained\r\nfrom the use of either tea or coffee as affecting his nervous system.\r\nHis mind retained much of its vigour, and his memory, as to events of\r\nlong standing, seemed to be unimpaired. Few octogenarians had as\r\nlittle of what is termed the garrulity of age as Colonel Burr. He\r\nnever was a great talker, and in the decline of life retained much of\r\nthat dignified sedateness which had characterized his meridian. When\r\nvisited by strangers he received them with courtesy, unless his pride\r\nbecame awakened by a suspicion that the visit was one of idle or\r\nimpertinent curiosity. On such occasions his manner was formal, cold,\r\nrepulsive. Under sufferings of body or mind he seldom complained; but,\r\nduring the last year of his life, he became more restive and\r\nimpatient. The friends of his youth had gone before him. All the ties\r\nof consanguinity which could operate in uniting him to the world were\r\nsevered asunder. To him there remained no brother, no sister, no\r\nchild, no lineal descendant. He had numbered four-score years, and was\r\nincapable, from disease, of moving abroad, or even dressing himself.\r\nHe therefore became restless, and seemed anxious for the arrival of\r\nthe hour when his eyes should be closed in everlasting sleep. At\r\nlength that hour came, and his mortal career terminated without a\r\nstruggle on Wednesday, the 14th of September, 1836, in the\r\neighty-first year of his age, on Staten Island, Richmond county, state\r\nof New-York, whither he had been removed for the benefit of pure air\r\nduring the warm season. In conformity with his wish, his body was\r\nremoved to Princeton, New-Jersey. The New-York Courier and Enquirer of\r\nthe 19th of September gives the following account of his funeral.\r\n\r\n_From the Courier and Enquirer._\r\n\r\n\"On Friday morning, the 16th of September, the body of the late\r\nColonel Aaron Burr was put on board a steamboat at Staten Island, and\r\nconveyed, with a number of his friends and relatives, from New-York to\r\nAmboy. Here it, with the followers, was received by the railroad cars\r\nand taken to Hightstown, nine miles from Princeton. A hearse and\r\ncarriage having been previously prepared, the remains, with the\r\nfriends of the departed, proceeded immediately to Princeton College,\r\nwhere the body was deposited until the hour of interment should\r\narrive--half past three o'clock.\r\n\r\n\"At the appointed hour, the professors, collegians, and citizens\r\nhaving assembled, the ceremony commenced by a prayer to the Throne of\r\nGrace. It was succeeded by a most eloquent, appropriate, and judicious\r\nsermon, delivered by the president of the college; after which the\r\nprocession was formed on the college green, and proceeded to the\r\nburying-ground under an escort of the military, accompanied by martial\r\nmusic. He was interred with the honours of war. The firing over the\r\ngrave was performed by a well-disciplined infantry corps, designated\r\nas the Mercer Guards. The professors and students of the college, and\r\nsome of the clergy and citizens, united with the relatives and friends\r\nof the deceased in the procession.\r\n\r\n\"The interment was in the college burying-place, near the tombs of his\r\nancestors, in his native state, under the superintendence of the\r\nfathers of that seat of learning where the budding of his mighty mind\r\nfirst displayed itself, where it was cultivated and matured, and where\r\nthe foundation was laid for those intellectual endowments which he\r\nafterward exhibited on the great theatre of life. He has shed a halo\r\nof literary glory around Nassau Hall. Through a long pilgrimage he\r\nloved her as the disciplinarian of his youthful mind. He vaunted that\r\nhe was one of her earliest and most attached sons. He joyed in her\r\nsuccess and sorrowed in her misfortunes. In this her last act of\r\nrespect to his memory, she has repaid those kind feelings in which he\r\nindulged during a long life; and heartless must be the friend of the\r\ndeceased who remembers not with gratitude this testimony of regard for\r\nthe giant mind of him who must fill a large space in the history of\r\nhis country. Peace be to his manes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extract from the Minutes of the Cliosophic Society._\r\n\r\n\"The Cliosophic Society having this morning received the mournful\r\nintelligence of the decease of Colonel Aaron Burr, formerly\r\nVice-president of the United States, an eminent member, and one of the\r\nfounders of our institution, would, in consideration of his eminence\r\nand talents, as well as the zeal with which he has promoted the\r\ninterests of our association, pay to his memory a tribute of respect\r\nexpressive of our admiration of his greatness and regret at his\r\ndemise. Be it therefore\r\n\r\n_\"Resolved,_ That the efforts of this individual in behalf of our\r\nsociety during her infant struggle, and the affectionate interest\r\nwhich he has at all times manifested for her success, claim from us an\r\nexpression of condolence for his loss and gratitude for his services.\r\n\r\n\"2d. That the whole society follow his remains to the grave as\r\nmourners.\r\n\r\n\"3d. That, as a feeble testimony of our respect, the members wear\r\ncrape on the left arm for the space of thirty days.\r\n\r\n\"4th. That these resolutions be published in the Princeton Whig,\r\nNew-York Courier and Enquirer, New-York Gazette, Commercial\r\nAdvertiser, United States Gazette, and United States Telegraph.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n1.
