KROPOTKIN IN 1906                 _Frontispiece_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Autobiographies which we owe to great minds have in former times\r\ngenerally been of one of three types: ‘So far I went astray, thus I\r\nfound the true path’ (St. Augustine); or, ‘So bad was I, but who dares\r\nto consider himself better!’ (Rousseau); or, ‘This is the way a genius\r\nhas slowly been evolved from within and by favourable surroundings’\r\n(Goethe). In these forms of self-representation the author is thus\r\nmainly pre-occupied with himself.\r\n\r\nIn the nineteenth century the autobiographies of men of mark are more\r\noften shaped on lines such as these: ‘So full of talent and attractive\r\nwas I; such appreciation and admiration I won!’ (Johanne Louise\r\nHeiberg, ‘A Life lived once more in Reminiscence’); or, ‘I was full\r\nof talent and worthy of being loved, but yet I was unappreciated, and\r\nthese were the hard struggles I went through before I won the crown\r\nof fame’ (Hans Christian Andersen, ‘The Tale of a Life’). The main\r\npre-occupation of the writer, in these two classes of life-records,\r\nis consequently with what his fellow-men have thought of him and said\r\nabout him.\r\n\r\nThe author of the autobiography before us is not pre-occupied with\r\nhis own capacities, and consequently describes no struggle to gain\r\nrecognition, Still less does he care for the opinions of his fellow-men\r\nabout himself; what others have thought of him, he dismisses with a\r\nsingle word.\r\n\r\nThere is in this work no gazing upon one’s own image. The author is not\r\none of those who willingly speak of themselves; when he does so, it\r\nis reluctantly and with a certain shyness. There is here no confession\r\nthat divulges the inner self, no sentimentality, and no cynicism. The\r\nauthor speaks neither of his sins nor of his virtues; he enters into no\r\nvulgar intimacy with his reader. He does not say when he fell in love,\r\nand he touches so little upon his relations with the other sex, that\r\nhe even omits to mention his marriage, and it is only incidentally we\r\nlearn that he is married at all. That he is a father, and a very loving\r\none, he finds time to mention just once in the rapid review of the last\r\nsixteen years of his life.\r\n\r\nHe is more anxious to give the psychology of his contemporaries than\r\nof himself; and one finds in his book the psychology of Russia: the\r\nofficial Russia and the masses underneath--Russia struggling forward\r\nand Russia stagnant. He strives to tell the story of his contemporaries\r\nrather than his own; and consequently, the record of his life contains\r\nthe history of Russia during his lifetime, as well as that of the\r\nlabour movement in Europe during the last half-century. When he plunges\r\ninto his own inner world, we see the outer world reflected in it.\r\n\r\nThere is, nevertheless, in this book an effect such as Goethe aimed\r\nat in ‘Dichtung und Wahrheit,’ the representation of how a remarkable\r\nmind has been shaped; and in analogy with the ‘Confessions’ of St.\r\nAugustine, we have the story of an inner crisis which corresponds with\r\nwhat in olden times was called ‘conversion.’ In fact, this inner crisis\r\nis the turning point and the core of the book.\r\n\r\nThere are at this moment only two great Russians who think for the\r\nRussian people, and whose thoughts belong to mankind, Leo Tolstoy and\r\nPeter Kropotkin. Tolstoy has often told us, in poetical shape, parts\r\nof his life. Kropotkin gives us here, for the first time, without any\r\npoetical recasting, a rapid survey of his whole career.\r\n\r\nHowever radically different these two men are, there is one parallel\r\nwhich can be drawn between the lives and the views on life of both.\r\nTolstoy is an artist, Kropotkin is a man of science; but there came a\r\nperiod in the career of each of them, when neither could find peace in\r\ncontinuing the work to which he had brought great inborn capacities.\r\nReligious considerations led Tolstoy, social considerations led\r\nKropotkin, to abandon the paths they had first taken.\r\n\r\nBoth are filled with love for mankind; and they are at one in the\r\nsevere condemnation of the indifference, the thoughtlessness, the\r\ncrudeness and brutality of the upper classes, as well as in the\r\nattraction they both feel towards the life of the downtrodden and\r\nill-used man of the people. Both see more cowardice than stupidity in\r\nthe world. Both are idealists and both have the reformer’s temperament.\r\nBoth are peace-loving natures, and Kropotkin is the more peaceful of\r\nthe two--although Tolstoy always preaches peace and condemns those who\r\ntake right into their own hands and resort to force, while Kropotkin\r\njustifies such action, and was on friendly terms with the Terrorists.\r\nThe point upon which they differ most is in their attitudes towards\r\nthe intelligent educated man and towards science altogether; Tolstoy,\r\nin his religious passion, disdains and disparages the man equally with\r\nthe thing, while Kropotkin holds both in high esteem, although at the\r\nsame time he condemns men of science for forgetting the people and the\r\nmisery of the masses.\r\n\r\nMany a man and many a woman have accomplished a great life-work without\r\nhaving led a great life. Many people are interesting, although their\r\nlives may have been quite insignificant and commonplace. Kropotkin’s\r\nlife is both great and interesting.\r\n\r\nIn this volume will be found a combination of all the elements out of\r\nwhich an intensely eventful life is composed--idyll and tragedy, drama\r\nand romance.\r\n\r\nThe childhood in Moscow and in the country, the portraits of his\r\nmother, sister, and teachers, of the old and trusty servants, together\r\nwith the many pictures of patriarchal life, are done in such a masterly\r\nway that every heart will be touched by them. The landscapes, the story\r\nof the unusually intense love between the two brothers--all this is\r\npure idyll.\r\n\r\nSide by side there is, unhappily, plenty of sorrow and suffering: the\r\nharshness in the family life, the cruel treatment of the serfs, and the\r\nnarrow-mindedness and heartlessness which are the ruling stars of men’s\r\ndestinies.\r\n\r\nThere is variety and there are dramatic catastrophes: life at Court\r\nand life in prison; life in the highest Russian society, by the side\r\nof emperors and grand dukes, and life in poverty, with the working\r\nproletariat, in London and in Switzerland. There are changes of costume\r\nas in a drama; the chief actor having to appear during the day in fine\r\ndress in the Winter Palace, and in the evening in peasant’s clothes\r\nin the suburbs, as a preacher of revolution. And there is, too, the\r\nsensational element that belongs to the novel. Although nobody could\r\nbe simpler in tone and style than Kropotkin, nevertheless parts of his\r\nnarrative, from the very nature of the events he has to tell, are more\r\nintensely exciting than anything in those novels which aim only at\r\nbeing sensational. One reads with breathless interest the preparations\r\nfor the escape from the hospital of the fortress of St. Paul and St.\r\nPeter, and the bold execution of the plan.\r\n\r\nFew men have moved, as Kropotkin did, in all layers of society; few\r\nknow all these layers as he does. What a picture! Kropotkin as a little\r\nboy with curled hair, in a fancy-dress costume, standing by the Emperor\r\nNicholas, or running after the Emperor Alexander as his page, with the\r\nidea of protecting him. And then again--Kropotkin in a terrible prison,\r\nsending away the Grand Duke Nicholas, or listening to the growing\r\ninsanity of a peasant who is confined in a cell under his very feet.\r\n\r\nHe has lived the life of the aristocrat and of the worker; he has been\r\none of the Emperor’s pages and a poverty-stricken writer; he has lived\r\nthe life of the student, the officer, the man of science, the explorer\r\nof unknown lands, the administrator, and the hunted revolutionist.\r\nIn exile he has had at times to live upon bread and tea as a Russian\r\npeasant; and he has been exposed to espionage and assassination plots\r\nlike a Russian emperor.\r\n\r\nFew men have had an equally wide field of experience. Just as Kropotkin\r\nis able, as a geologist, to survey prehistoric evolution for hundreds\r\nof thousands of years past, so too he has assimilated the whole\r\nhistorical evolution of his own times. To the literary and scientific\r\neducation which is won in the study and in the university (such as\r\nthe knowledge of languages, belles-lettres, philosophy, and higher\r\nmathematics), he added at an early stage of his life that education\r\nwhich is gained in the workshop, in the laboratory, and in the open\r\nfield--natural science, military science, fortification, knowledge of\r\nmechanical and industrial processes. His intellectual equipment is\r\nuniversal.\r\n\r\nWhat must this active mind have suffered when he was reduced to the\r\ninactivity of prison life! What a test of endurance and what an\r\nexercise in stoicism! Kropotkin says somewhere that a morally developed\r\npersonality must be at the foundation of every organization. That\r\napplies to him. Life has made of him one of the cornerstones for the\r\nbuilding of the future.\r\n\r\nThe crisis in Kropotkin’s life has two turning points which must be\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nHe approaches his thirtieth year--the decisive year in a man’s life.\r\nWith heart and soul he is a man of science; he has made a valuable\r\nscientific discovery. He has found out that the maps of Northern Asia\r\nare incorrect; that not only the old conceptions of the geography\r\nof Asia are wrong, but that the theories of Humboldt are also in\r\ncontradiction with the facts. For more than two years he has plunged\r\ninto laborious research. Then, suddenly, on a certain day, the true\r\nrelations of the facts flash upon him; he understands that the main\r\nlines of structure in Asia are not from north to south or from west\r\nto east, but from the south-west to the north-east. He submits his\r\ndiscovery to test, he applies it to numerous separated facts, and--it\r\nholds its ground. Thus he knew the joy of scientific revelation in its\r\nhighest and purest form; he has felt how elevating is its action on the\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nThen comes the crisis. The thought that these joys are the lot of so\r\nfew, fills him now with sorrow. He asks himself whether he has the\r\nright to enjoy this knowledge alone--for himself. He feels that there\r\nis a higher duty before him--to do his part in bringing to the mass\r\nof the people the information already gained, rather than to work at\r\nmaking new discoveries.\r\n\r\nFor my part I do not think that he was right. With such conceptions\r\nPasteur would not have been the benefactor of mankind that he has been.\r\nAfter all, everything, in the long run, is to the benefit of the mass\r\nof the people. I think that a man does the utmost for the well-being\r\nof all when he has given to the world the most intense production of\r\nwhich he is capable. But this fundamental notion is characteristic of\r\nKropotkin; it contains his very essence.\r\n\r\nAnd this attitude of mind carries him farther. In Finland, where\r\nhe is going to make a new scientific discovery, as he comes to the\r\nidea--which was heresy at that time--that in prehistoric ages all\r\nNorthern Europe was buried under ice, he is so much impressed with\r\ncompassion for the poor, the suffering, who often know hunger in their\r\nstruggle for bread, that he considers it his highest, absolute duty to\r\nbecome a teacher and helper of the great working and destitute masses.\r\n\r\nSoon after that a new world opens before him---the life of the working\r\nclasses--and he _learns_ from those whom he intends to _teach_.\r\n\r\nFive or six years later this crisis appears in its second phase. It\r\nhappens in Switzerland. Already during his first stay there Kropotkin\r\nhad abandoned the group of state-socialists, from fear of an economical\r\ndespotism, from hatred of centralization, from love for the freedom\r\nof the individual and the commune. Now, however, after his long\r\nimprisonment in Russia, during his second stay amidst the intelligent\r\nworkers of West Switzerland, the conception which floated before his\r\neyes of a new structure of society, more distinctly dawns upon him\r\nin the shape of a society of federated associations, co-operating in\r\nthe same way as the railway companies, or the postal departments of\r\nseparate countries co-operate. He knows that he cannot dictate to the\r\nfuture the lines which it will have to follow; he is convinced that\r\nall must grow out of the constructive activity of the masses, but he\r\ncompares, for the sake of illustration, the coming structure with the\r\nguilds and the mutual relations which existed in mediæval times, and\r\nwere worked out from below. He does not believe in the distinction\r\nbetween leaders and led; but I must confess that I am old-fashioned\r\nenough to feel pleased when Kropotkin, by a slight inconsistency, says\r\nonce in praise of a friend that he was ‘a born leader of men.’\r\n\r\nThe author describes himself as a Revolutionist, and he is surely quite\r\nright in so doing. But seldom have there been revolutionists so humane\r\nand mild. One feels astounded when, in alluding on one occasion to the\r\npossibility of an armed conflict with the Swiss police, there appears\r\nin his character the fighting instinct which exists in all of us. He\r\ncannot say precisely in this passage whether he and his friends felt a\r\nrelief at being spared a fight, or a regret that the fight did not take\r\nplace. This expression of feeling stands alone. He has never been an\r\navenger, but always a martyr.\r\n\r\nHe does not impose sacrifices upon others; he makes them himself. All\r\nhis life he has done it, but in such a way that the sacrifice seems to\r\nhave cost him nothing. So little does he make of it. And with all his\r\nenergy he is so far from being vindictive, that of a disgusting prison\r\ndoctor he only remarks: ‘The less said of him the better.’\r\n\r\nHe is a revolutionist without emphasis and without emblem. He laughs\r\nat the oaths and ceremonies with which conspirators bind themselves in\r\ndramas and operas. This man is simplicity personified. In character he\r\nwill bear comparison with any of the fighters for freedom in all lands.\r\nNone have been more disinterested than he, none have loved mankind more\r\nthan he does.\r\n\r\nBut he would not permit me to say in the forefront of his book all the\r\ngood that I think of him, and should I say it, my words would outrun\r\nthe limits of a reasonable Preface.\r\n\r\n                                                       GEORGE BRANDES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nTO THE SECOND EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the first edition of this book was brought out at the end of 1899,\r\nit was evident to those who had followed the development of affairs in\r\nRussia that, owing to the obstinacy of its rulers in refusing to make\r\nthe necessary concessions in the way of political freedom, the country\r\nwas rapidly drifting towards a violent revolution. But everything\r\nseemed to be so calm on the surface, that when a few of us expressed\r\nthis idea, we were generally told that we merely took our desires for\r\nrealities. At the present moment Russia is in full revolution. The\r\nold system is falling to pieces, and amidst its ruins the new one is\r\npainfully making its way. Meanwhile the defenders of the past are\r\nwaging a war of extermination against the country--a war which may\r\nprolong their rule for a few additional months, but which raises at the\r\nsame time the passions of the people to a pitch that is full of menaces\r\nand danger.\r\n\r\nLooked upon in the light of present events, the early movements for\r\nfreedom which are related in this book acquire a new meaning. They\r\nappear as the preparatory phases of the great breakdown of a whole\r\nobsolete world--a breakdown which is sure to give a new life to nearly\r\none hundred and fifty million people, and to exercise at the same time\r\na deep and favourable influence upon the march of progress in all\r\nEurope and Asia. It seems necessary, therefore, to complete the record\r\nof events given in this book by a rapid review of those which have\r\ntaken place during the last seven years, and were the immediate cause\r\nof the present revolution.\r\n\r\nThe thirteen years of the reign of Alexander III., 1881-1894, were\r\nperhaps the gloomiest portion in the nineteenth century history of\r\nRussia. Reaction had been growing worse and worse during the last few\r\nyears of the reign of his father--with the result that a terrible war\r\nhad been waged against autocracy by the Executive Committee, which had\r\ninscribed on its banner political freedom. After the tragic death of\r\nAlexander II., his son considered it his duty to make no concessions\r\nwhatever to the general demand of representative government, and a few\r\nweeks after his advent to the throne he solemnly declared his intention\r\nof remaining an autocratic ruler of his Empire. And then began a heavy,\r\nsilent, crushing reaction against all the great, inspiring ideas of\r\nLiberty which our generation had lived through at the time of the\r\nliberation of the serfs--a reaction, perhaps the more terrible on\r\naccount of its not being accompanied by striking and revolting acts\r\nof violence, but slowly crushing down all the progressive reforms of\r\nAlexander II., and the very spirit that bred these reforms, and turning\r\neverything, including education, into tools of a general reaction.\r\n\r\nSheer despair got hold of the generation of the Russian ‘intellectuals’\r\nwho had to live through that period. The few survivors of the\r\nExecutive Committee laid down their arms, and there spread in Russian\r\nintellectual society that helpless despair, that loss of faith in the\r\nforces of ‘the intellectual,’ that general invasion of common-place\r\nvulgarity which Tchékhoff has pictured with such a depressing sadness\r\nin his novels.\r\n\r\nTrue, that Alexander III., since his advent to the throne, had vaguely\r\nunderstood the importance of several economic questions concerning the\r\nwelfare of the peasants, and had included them in his programme. But\r\nwith the set of reactionary advisers whom he had summoned to his aid,\r\nand whom he retained throughout his reign, he could accomplish nothing\r\nserious; the reactionaries whom he trusted did _not_ at all want to\r\nmake those serious improvements in the conditions of the peasants\r\nwhich he considered it the mission of autocracy to accomplish; and he\r\nwould not call in other men, because he knew that they would require\r\na limitation of the powers of autocracy, which he would not admit.\r\nWhen he died, a general feeling of relief went through Russia and the\r\ncivilized world at large.\r\n\r\nNever had a Tsar ascended the throne under more favourable\r\ncircumstances than Nicholas II. After these thirteen years of reaction,\r\nthe state of mind in Russia was such, that if Nicholas II. had only\r\nmentioned, in his advent manifesto, the intention of taking the advice\r\nof his country upon the great questions of inner policy which required\r\nan immediate solution, he would have been received with open arms.\r\n\r\nThe smallest concession would have been gladly accepted as an asset. In\r\nfact, the delegates of the Zemstvos, assembled to greet him, asked him\r\nonly--and this in the most submissive manner--‘to establish a closer\r\nintercourse between the Emperor and the provincial representation of\r\nthe land.’ But instead of accepting this modest invitation, Nicholas\r\nII. read before the Zemstvo representatives the insolent speech of\r\nreprimand, which had been written for him by Pobiedonostseff, and\r\nwhich expressed his intention of remaining an autocratic ruler of his\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nA golden opportunity was thus lost. Distrust became now the dominating\r\nnote in the relations between the nation and the Tsar, and it was\r\nstriking to see how this distrust--in one of those indescribable ways\r\nin which popular feelings develop--rapidly spread from the Winter\r\nPalace to the remotest corners of Russia.\r\n\r\nThe results of that distrust soon became apparent. The great strikes\r\nwhich broke out at St. Petersburg in 1895, at the time of the\r\ncoronation of Nicholas II., gave a measure of the depth of discontent\r\nwhich was growing in the masses of the people. The seriousness of the\r\ndiscontent and the unity of action which this revealed were quite\r\nunsuspected. What an immense distance was covered since those times,\r\nof which I speak in this book, when we used to meet small groups of\r\nweavers in the Viborg suburb of St. Petersburg, and asked them with\r\ndespair if it really was impossible to induce their comrades to join\r\nin a strike, so as to obtain a reduction of the hours of labour, which\r\nwere fourteen and sixteen at that time! Now, the same working-men\r\ncombined all over St. Petersburg, and brought out of their ranks such\r\nspeakers and such organisers, as if they had been trade-union hands for\r\nages.\r\n\r\nTwo years later, in 1897, there were serious disturbances in all\r\nthe Russian universities; but when a second series of student\r\ndisturbances began in 1901, they suddenly assumed a quite unexpected\r\npolitical significance. The students protested this time against a\r\nlaw, passed by Nicholas II., who had ordered--again on the advice of\r\nPobiedonostseff--that students implicated in academical disorders\r\nshould be sent to Port Arthur as soldiers. Hundreds of them were\r\ntreated accordingly. Formerly, such a movement would have remained a\r\nuniversity matter; now it assumed a serious political character and\r\nstirred various classes of society. At Moscow the working-men supported\r\nthe students in their street demonstrations, and fought at their side\r\nagainst the police. At St. Petersburg all sorts of people, including\r\nthe workmen’s organizations, joined in the street demonstrations, and\r\nserious fighting took place in the streets. When the manifestations\r\nwere dispersed by the lead-weighted horsewhips of the Cossacks, who cut\r\nopen the faces of men and women assembled in the streets, there was a\r\nstrikingly unanimous outburst of public indignation.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned in this book how tragical was the position of our\r\nyouth in the seventies and eighties, on account of ‘the fathers’ having\r\nabandoned entirely to their sons the terrible task of struggling\r\nagainst a powerful government. Now, ‘the fathers’ joined hands with\r\n‘the sons.’ The ‘respectable’ Society of Authors issued a strongly\r\nworded protest. A venerated old member of the Council of the State,\r\nPrince Vyazemsky, did the same. Even the officers of the Cossacks of\r\nthe Bodyguard notified their unwillingness to carry on such police\r\nduties. In short, discontent was so general and so openly expressed,\r\nthat the Committee of Ministers, assuming for the first time since\r\nits foundation the _rôle_ of a ‘Ministry,’ discussed the Imperial\r\norder concerning the students, and insisted upon, and obtained, its\r\nwithdrawal.\r\n\r\nSomething quite unexpected had thus happened. A rash and ill-tempered\r\nmeasure of the young autocrat had thus set all the country on fire. It\r\nresulted in two ministers being killed; in bloodshed in the streets\r\nof Kharkoff, Moscow and St. Petersburg; and it would have become the\r\ncause of further disasters if Nicholas II. had not been prevented from\r\ndeclaring the state of siege in his capital, which surely would have\r\nled to still more bloodshed.\r\n\r\nAll this was pointing to such a deep change in the mind of the nation,\r\nthat already in the early spring of 1901--long before the declaration\r\nof war with Japan--it became evident that the days of autocracy were\r\nalready counted: ‘Speaking plainly,’ I wrote in the ‘North American\r\nReview,’ ‘the fact is that Russia has outgrown the autocratic form\r\nof government; and it may be said confidently that if external\r\ncomplications do not disturb the peaceful development of Russia,\r\nNicholas II. will soon be brought to realize that he is bound to take\r\nsteps for meeting the wishes of the country. Let us hope that he will\r\nunderstand the proper sense of the lesson which he has received during\r\nthe past two months’ (May 1901, p. 723).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Nicholas II. understood nothing. He did, on the\r\ncontrary, everything to bring about the revolution. He contributed to\r\nspread discontent everywhere: in Finland, in Poland, in Armenia (by\r\nconfiscating the property of the Armenian Church), and in Russia itself\r\namongst the peasants, the students, the working-men, the dissenters,\r\nand so on. More than that. Efforts were made, on different sides, to\r\ninduce Nicholas II. to adopt a better policy; but always he himself--so\r\nweak for good--found the force to resist these influences. At a\r\ndecisive moment he always would find enough energy to turn the scales\r\nin favour of reaction, by his personal interference. It has been said\r\nof him that obstinacy was a distinctive feature of his character,\r\nand this seems to be true enough; but he displays it exclusively to\r\noppose those progressive measures which the necessities of the moment\r\nrender imperative. Even if he occasionally yields to progressive\r\ninfluences, he always manages very soon to counteract them in secrecy.\r\nHe displays, in fact, precisely those features which necessarily lead\r\nto a revolution.\r\n\r\nIn 1901 it was evident that the old order of things would soon have to\r\nbe abandoned. The then Minister of Finances, Witte, must have realized\r\nit, and he took a step which certainly meant that he was preparing\r\na transition from autocracy to some sort of a half-constitutional\r\n_régime_. The ‘Commissions on the Impoverishment of Agriculture\r\nin Central Russia,’ which he convoked in thirty-four provinces,\r\nundoubtedly meant to supply that intermediary step, and the country\r\nanswered to his call in the proper way. Landlords and peasants alike\r\nsaid and maintained quite openly in these Commissions that Russia could\r\nnot remain any longer under the system of police rule established by\r\nAlexander III. Equal rights for all subjects, political liberties, and\r\nconstitutional guarantees were declared to be an urgent necessity.\r\n\r\nAgain a splendid opportunity was offered to Nicholas II. for taking\r\na step towards constitutional rule. The Agricultural Commissions had\r\nindicated how to do it. Similar committees had to be convoked in all\r\nprovinces of the Empire, and they would name their representatives\r\nwho would meet at Moscow and work out the basis of a national\r\nrepresentation. And once more Nicholas II. refused to accept that\r\nopening. He preferred to follow the counsels of his more intimate\r\nadvisers, who better expressed his own will. He disowned Witte and\r\ncalled at the head of the Ministry of Interior Von Plehwe--the worst\r\nproduce of reaction that had been bred by police rule during the reign\r\nof Alexander III.!\r\n\r\nEven that man did not undertake to maintain autocracy indefinitely; but\r\nhe undertook to maintain it for ten years more--provided full powers\r\nbe granted to him, and plenty of money be given--which money he, a\r\npupil of the school of Ignatieff, freely used, it is now known, for\r\norganizing the ‘pogroms’--the massacres of the Jews. More than that.\r\nPrince Meschersky, the well-known editor of the _Grazhdanin_--an old\r\nman, a Conservative of old standing, and a devotee of the Imperial\r\nfamily--wrote lately in his paper that Plehwe, in order to give a\r\nfurther lease to autocracy, had decided to do his utmost to push\r\nNicholas II. into that terrible war with Japan. Like the Franco-German\r\nconflict, the Japanese war was thus the last trump of a decaying\r\nImperial power.\r\n\r\nI certainly do not mean that Plehwe’s will was the _cause_ of that\r\nwar. Its causes lie deeper than that. It became unavoidable the day\r\nthat Russia got hold of Port Arthur--and even much earlier than that.\r\nBut this move of Plehwe, and the support he found in his master, are\r\ndeeply significant for the comprehension of the present events in\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nPlehwe was the trump card of autocracy. He was invested with unlimited\r\npowers, and used them for placing all Russia under police rule. The\r\nState police became the most demoralized and dangerous body in the\r\nState. More than 30,000 persons were deported by the police to remote\r\ncorners of the Empire. Fabulous sums of money were spent for his\r\nown protection--but that did not help; he was killed in July 1904,\r\namidst the disasters of the war that he had been so eager to call\r\nupon his country. And since that date the events took a new and rapid\r\ndevelopment. The system of police rule was defeated, and nobody in the\r\nTsar’s surroundings would attempt to continue it.\r\n\r\nFor six weeks in succession nobody would agree to become the Tsar’s\r\nMinister of Interior; and when the Prince Svyatopolk-Mirsky was\r\ninduced at last to accept it, he did so under the condition that\r\nrepresentatives of all the Zemstvos would be convoked at once, to work\r\nout a scheme of national representation.\r\n\r\nA great agitation spread thereupon in all Russia, when a Congress of\r\nthe Zemstvos was allowed to come together ‘unofficially’ at Moscow in\r\nDecember 1904. The Zemstvos were quite outspoken in their demands for\r\nconstitutional guarantees, and their ‘Memorandum’ to the Tsar, signed\r\nby 102 representatives out of 104, was soon signed also by numbers\r\nof representative persons of different classes in Russia. By-and-by\r\nsimilarly worded ‘Memoranda’ were addressed to the Tsar by the\r\nbarristers and magistrates, the Assemblies of the Nobility in certain\r\nprovinces, some municipalities, and so on. The Zemstvo memorandum\r\nbecame thus a sort of ultimatum of the educated portion of the nation,\r\nwhich rapidly organized itself into a number of professional unions.\r\nThe year 1904 thus ended in a state of great excitement.\r\n\r\nThen a new element--the working-men--came to throw the weight of their\r\nintervention in favour of the liberating movement. The working-men of\r\nSt. Petersburg--whom that original personality, Father Gapon, had been\r\nmost energetically organizing for the preceding twelve months--came to\r\nthe idea of an immense manifestation which would claim from the Tsar\r\npolitical rights for the workers. On January 22, 1905, they went out--a\r\ndense and unarmed crowd of more than 100,000 persons, marching from\r\nall the suburbs towards the Winter Palace. Up to that date they had\r\nretained an unbroken faith in the good intentions of Nicholas II., and\r\nthey wanted to tell him themselves of their needs. They trusted him as\r\nif he really was their father. But a massacre of these faithful crowds\r\nhad been prepared beforehand by the military commander of the capital,\r\nwith all the precautions of modern warfare--local staffs, ambulances,\r\nand so on. For a full week the manifestation was openly prepared by\r\nGapon and his aids, and nothing was done by the Government to dissuade\r\nthe workers from their venture. They marched towards the Palace and\r\ncrowded round it--sure that the Tsar would appear before them and\r\nreceive their petition--when the firing began. The troops fired into\r\nthe dense, absolutely pacific and unarmed crowds, at a range of a few\r\ndozen yards, and more than a thousand--perhaps two thousand--men,\r\nwomen and children fell that day, the victims of the Tsar’s fears and\r\nobstinacy.\r\n\r\nThis was how the Russian revolution began, by the extermination of\r\npeaceful, trustworthy crowds, and this double character of passive\r\nendurance from beneath, and of bloodthirsty extermination from above,\r\nit retains up till now. A deep chasm is thus being dug, deeper and\r\ndeeper every day, between the people and the present rulers, a chasm\r\nwhich--I am inclined to think--never will be filled.\r\n\r\nIf these massacres were meant to terrorize the masses, they utterly\r\nfailed in their purpose. Five days after the ‘bloody Vladimir Sunday’\r\na mass-strike began at Warsaw and similar strikes soon spread all over\r\nPoland. All classes of Polish society joined more or less actively in\r\nthese strikes, which took a formidable extension in the following May.\r\nIn fact, all the fabric of the State was shattered by these strikes,\r\nand the series of massacres which the Russian Government inaugurated in\r\nPoland in January and in May 1905, only led to an uninterrupted series\r\nof retaliations in which all Polish society evidently stands on the\r\nside of the terrorists. The result is, that at the present time Poland\r\nis virtually lost to the Russian autocratic Empire. Unless it obtains\r\nas complete an autonomy as Finland obtained in 1905, it will not resume\r\nits normal life.\r\n\r\nGradually, the revolts began to spread all over Russia. The peasant\r\nuprising now assumed serious proportions in different parts of the\r\nEmpire, everywhere the peasants showing moderation in their demands,\r\ntogether with a great capacity for organized action, but everywhere\r\nalso insisting upon the necessity of a move in the sense of land\r\nnationalization. In the western portion of Georgia (in Transcaucasia)\r\nthey even organized independent communities, similar to those of the\r\nold cantons of Switzerland. At the same time a race-war began in the\r\nCaucasus; then came a great uprising at Odessa; the mutiny of the\r\niron-clads of the Black Sea; and a second series of general strikes\r\nin Poland, again followed by massacres. And only then, when all\r\nRussia was set into open revolt, Nicholas II. finally yielded to the\r\ngeneral demands, and announced, in a manifesto issued on the 19th of\r\nAugust, that some sort of national representation would be given to\r\nRussia in the shape of a State’s Duma. This was the famous ‘Bulyghin\r\nConstitution,’ which granted the right of voting to an infinitesimal\r\nfraction only of the population (one man in each 200, even in such\r\nwealthy cities as St. Petersburg and Moscow), and entirely excluded\r\n4,000,000 working-men from any participation in the political life\r\nof the country. This tardy concession evidently satisfied nobody; it\r\nwas met with disdain. Mignet, the author of a well-known history of\r\nthe French Revolution, was right when he wrote that in such times\r\nthe concessions must come from the Government _before_ any serious\r\nbloodshed has taken place. If they come _after_ it, they are useless;\r\nthe Revolution will take no heed of them and pursue its unavoidable,\r\nnatural development. So it happened in Russia.\r\n\r\nA simple incident--a strike of the bakers at Moscow--was the beginning\r\nof a general strike, which soon spread over all Moscow, including all\r\nits trades, and from Moscow extended all over Russia. The sufferings of\r\nthe working-men during that general strike were terrible, but they held\r\nout. All traffic on the railways was stopped, and no provisions, no\r\nfuel reached Moscow. No newspapers appeared, except the proclamations\r\nof the strike committees. Thousands of passengers, tons of letters,\r\nmountains of goods accumulated at the stations. St. Petersburg soon\r\njoined the strike, and there, too, the workers displayed wonderful\r\npowers of organization. No gas, no electric light, no tramways, no\r\nwater, no cabs, no post, no telegraphs! The factories were silent, the\r\ncity was plunged in darkness. Then, gradually, the enthusiasm of the\r\npoorer classes won the others as well. The shop assistants, the clerks\r\nin the banks, the teachers, the actors, the lawyers, the chemists--even\r\nthe judges joined the strike. A whole country struck against its\r\ngovernment, and the strikers kept so strict an order, that they offered\r\nno opportunity for military intervention and massacres. Committees\r\nof Labour Representatives came into existence, and they were obeyed\r\nexplicitly by the crowds, 300,000 strong, which filled the streets of\r\nSt. Petersburg and Moscow.\r\n\r\nThe panic in the Tsar’s _entourage_ was at a climax. His usual\r\nConservative advisers proved to be as unreliable as the _talons rouges_\r\nwere in the surroundings of Louis XVI. Then--only then--Nicholas II.\r\ncalled in Count Witte and agreed on the 30th of October to sign a\r\nconstitutional manifesto. He declared in it that it was his ‘inflexible\r\nwill’ ‘to grant to the population the immutable foundations of civic\r\nliberty, based on real inviolability of the person, conscience, speech,\r\nunion, and association.’ For that purpose he ordered to elect a State’s\r\nDuma, and promised ‘to establish it as an immutable rule that no law\r\ncan come into force without the approval of the State Duma,’ and that\r\nthe people’s representatives ‘should have a real participation in the\r\nsupervision of the legality of the acts of the authorities appointed by\r\nthe Crown.’\r\n\r\nTwo days later, as the crowds which filled the streets of St.\r\nPetersburg were going to storm the two chief prisons, Count Witte\r\nobtained from him also the granting of an almost general amnesty for\r\npolitical offenders.\r\n\r\nThese promises produced a tremendous enthusiasm, but, alas, they were\r\nsoon broken in many important points.\r\n\r\nIt appears now from an official document, just published--the report of\r\nthe Head of the Police Department, Lopukhin, to the Premier Minister\r\nStolypin--that at the very moment when the crowds were jubilating\r\nin the streets, the Monarchist party organized hired bands for the\r\nslaughter of the jubilating crowds. The gendarme officers hurriedly\r\nprinted with their own hands appeals calling for the massacre ‘of the\r\nintellectuals and the Jews,’ and saying that they were the hirelings of\r\nthe Japanese and the English. Two bishops, Nikon and Nikander, in their\r\npastoral letters, called upon all the ‘true Russians’ ‘to put down the\r\nintellectuals by force’; while from the footsteps of the Chapel of the\r\nVirgin of Iberia, at Moscow, improvised orators tried to induce the\r\ncrowds to kill all the students.\r\n\r\nMore than that. The same Prince Meschersky confessed in his\r\npaper--‘with horror’ as he said--that it was a settled plan, hatched\r\namong some of the rulers of St. Petersburg, to provoke a serious\r\ninsurrection, to drown it in blood, and thus ‘to let the Duma die\r\nbefore it was born, so as to return to the old _régime_.’ ‘Several high\r\nfunctionaries have confessed this to me,’ he adds in his paper.\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured in this book to be fair towards Alexander II., and\r\nI certainly should like to be equally fair towards Nicholas II., the\r\nmore as he, besides his own faults, pays for those of his father and\r\ngrandfather. But I must say that the cordial reception which he gave\r\nat that time in his palace to the representatives of the above party,\r\nand his protection which they have enjoyed since, were certainly an\r\nencouragement to continue on these lines of breeding massacres of\r\ninnocent people--even if the encouragement be unconscious.\r\n\r\nBut then came the insurrection at Moscow, in January 1906, provoked to\r\na great extent by the Governor-General, Admiral Dubassoff; the uprising\r\nof the peasants in the Baltic provinces against the tyranny of their\r\nGerman landlords; the general strike along the Siberian railway; and a\r\ngreat number (over 1,600) of peasant uprisings in Russia itself; and\r\nin all these cases the military repression was accomplished in such\r\nterrible forms, including flogging to death, and with such a cruelty,\r\nthat one could really come to totally despair of civilization, if\r\nthere were not by the side of these cruelties acts of sublime heroism\r\non behalf of the lovers of freedom.\r\n\r\nIt was under such conditions that the Duma met in May 1905, to be\r\ndissolved after an existence of only seventy days. Its fate evidently\r\nhad been settled at Peterhof, before it met. A powerful league of all\r\nthe reactionary elements, lead by Trépoff, who found strong support\r\nwith Nicholas II. himself, was formed with the firm intention of not\r\nallowing the Duma, under any pretext, to exercise a real control upon\r\nthe actions of the Ministers nominated by the Tsar. And as the Duma\r\nstrove to obtain this right above all others, it was dissolved.\r\n\r\nAnd now, the condition of Russia is simply beyond description. The\r\nitems which we have for the first year of ‘Constitutional rule,’\r\nsince October 30, 1905, till the same date in 1906, are as follows:\r\nKilled in the massacres, shot in the riots, etc., 22,721; condemned\r\nto penal servitude, 851 (to an aggregate of 7,138 years); executed,\r\nmostly without any semblance of judgment, men, women and youths, 1,518;\r\ndeported without judgment, mostly to Siberia, 30,000. And the list\r\nincreases still at the rate of from ten to eighteen every day.\r\n\r\nThese facts speak for themselves. They talk at Peterhof of maintaining\r\n‘autocracy,’ but there is none left, except that of the eighty\r\ngovernors of the provinces, each of whom is, like an African king,\r\nan autocrat in his own domain, so long as his orders please his\r\nsubordinates. Bloodshed, drumhead military courts, and rapine are\r\nflourishing everywhere. Famine is menacing thirty different provinces.\r\nAnd Russia has to go through all that, merely to maintain for a few\r\nadditional months the irresponsible rule of a camarilla standing round\r\nthe throne of the Tsar.\r\n\r\nHow long this state of affairs will last, nobody can foretell. During\r\nboth the English and the French Revolutions reaction also took for a\r\ntime the upper hand; in France this lasted nearly two years. But the\r\nexperience of the last few months has also shown that Russia possesses\r\nsuch a reserve of sound, solid forces in those classes of society upon\r\nwhom depends the wealth of the country, that the present orgy of White\r\nTerror certainly will not last long. The army, which has hitherto been\r\na support of reaction, shows already signs of a better comprehension\r\nof its duties towards its mother country; and the crimes of the joined\r\nreactionists become too evident not to be understood by the soldiers.\r\nAs to the revolutionists, after having first minimized the forces of\r\nthe old _régime_, they realize them now and prepare for a struggle\r\non a more solid and a broader basis; while the devotion of thousands\r\nupon thousands of young men and women is such, that virtually it\r\nseems to be inexhaustible. In such conditions, the ultimate victory\r\nof those elements which work for the birth of a regenerated, free\r\nRussia, is not to be doubted for a moment, especially if they find,\r\nas I hope they will, the sympathy and the support of the lovers of\r\nFreedom all over the world. Regenerated Russia means a body of some\r\n150,000,000 persons--one-eighth part of the population of the globe,\r\noccupying one-sixth part of its continental parts--permitted at last to\r\ndevelop peacefully--a population which, owing to its very composition,\r\nis bound to become, not an Empire in the Roman sense of the word,\r\nbut a Federation of nations combined for the peaceful purposes of\r\ncivilization and progress.\r\n\r\n  BROMLEY, KENT,\r\n      _November, 1906_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART FIRST\r\n\r\nCHILDHOOD\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nMoscow is a city of slow historical growth, and down to the present\r\ntime its different parts have wonderfully well retained the features\r\nwhich have been stamped upon them in the slow course of history. The\r\nTrans-Moskva River district, with its broad, sleepy streets and its\r\nmonotonous gray painted, low-roofed houses, of which the entrance-gates\r\nremain securely bolted day and night, has always been the secluded\r\nabode of the merchant class, and the stronghold of the outwardly\r\naustere, formalistic, and despotic Nonconformists of the ‘Old Faith.’\r\nThe citadel, or Kreml is still the stronghold of Church and State; and\r\nthe immense space in front of it, covered with thousands of shops and\r\nwarehouses, has been for centuries a crowded beehive of commerce, and\r\nstill remains the heart of a great internal trade which spreads over\r\nthe whole surface of the vast empire. The Tverskáya and the Smiths’\r\nBridge have been for hundreds of years the chief centres for the\r\nfashionable shops; while the artisans’ quarters, the Pluschíkha and\r\nthe Dorogomílovka, retain the very same features which characterized\r\ntheir uproarious populations in the times of the Moscow Tsars. Each\r\nquarter is a little world in itself; each has its own physiognomy,\r\nand lives its own separate life. Even the railways, when they made an\r\nirruption into the old capital, grouped apart in special centres on\r\nthe outskirts of the old town their stores and machine-works and their\r\nheavily loaded carts and engines.\r\n\r\nHowever, of all parts of Moscow, none, perhaps, is more typical than\r\nthat labyrinth of clean, quiet, winding streets and lanes which lies at\r\nthe back of the Kreml, between two great radial streets, the Arbát and\r\nthe Prechístenka, and is still called the Old Equerries’ Quarter--the\r\nStáraya Konyúshennaya.\r\n\r\nSome fifty years ago, there lived in this quarter, and slowly died\r\nout, the old Moscow nobility, whose names were so frequently mentioned\r\nin the pages of Russian history before the time of Peter I., but who\r\nsubsequently disappeared to make room for the new-comers, ‘the men of\r\nall ranks’--called into service by the founder of the Russian state.\r\nFeeling themselves supplanted at the St. Petersburg court, these nobles\r\nof the old stock retired either to the Old Equerries’ Quarter in\r\nMoscow, or to their picturesque estates in the country round about the\r\ncapital, and they looked with a sort of contempt and secret jealousy\r\nupon the motley crowd of families which came ‘from no one knew where’\r\nto take possession of the highest functions of the government, in the\r\nnew capital on the banks of the Nevá.\r\n\r\nIn their younger days most of them had tried their fortunes in the\r\nservice of the state, chiefly in the army; but for one reason or\r\nanother they had soon abandoned it, without having risen to high rank.\r\nThe more successful ones obtained some quiet, almost honorary position\r\nin their mother city--my father was one of these--while most of the\r\nothers simply retired from active service. But wheresoever they might\r\nhave been shifted, in the course of their careers, over the wide\r\nsurface of Russia, they always somehow managed to spend their old age\r\nin a house of their own in the Old Equerries’ Quarter, under the shadow\r\nof the church where they had been baptized, and where the last prayers\r\nhad been pronounced at the burial of their parents.\r\n\r\nNew branches budded from the old stocks. Some of them achieved more\r\nor less distinction in different parts of Russia; some owned more\r\nluxurious houses in the new style in other quarters of Moscow or at\r\nSt. Petersburg; but the branch which continued to reside in the Old\r\nEquerries’ Quarter, somewhere near to the green, the yellow, the pink,\r\nor the brown church which was endeared through family associations,\r\nwas considered as the true representative of the family, irrespective\r\nof the position it occupied in the family tree. Its old-fashioned head\r\nwas treated with great respect, not devoid, I must say, of a slight\r\ntinge of irony, even by those younger representatives of the same stock\r\nwho had left their mother city for a more brilliant career in the St.\r\nPetersburg Guards or in the court circles. He personified, for them,\r\nthe antiquity of the family and its traditions.\r\n\r\nIn these quiet streets, far away from the noise and bustle of the\r\ncommercial Moscow, all the houses had much the same appearance. They\r\nwere mostly built of wood, with bright green sheet-iron roofs, the\r\nexteriors stuccoed and decorated with columns and porticoes; all were\r\npainted in gay colours. Nearly every house had but one story, with\r\nseven or nine big, gay-looking windows facing the street. A second\r\nstory was admitted only in the back part of the house, which looked\r\nupon a spacious yard, surrounded by numbers of small buildings, used\r\nas kitchens, stables, cellars, coach-houses, and as dwellings for\r\nthe retainers and servants. A wide gate opened upon this yard, and a\r\nbrass plate on it usually bore the inscription, ‘House of So-and-So,\r\nLieutenant or Colonel, and Commander’--very seldom ‘Major-General’\r\nor any similarly elevated civil rank. But if a more luxurious house,\r\nembellished by a gilded iron railing and an iron gate, stood in one of\r\nthose streets, the brass plate on the gate was sure to bear the name of\r\n‘Commerce Counsel’ or ‘Honourable Citizen’ So-and-So. These were the\r\nintruders, those who came unasked to settle in this quarter, and were\r\ntherefore ignored by their neighbours.\r\n\r\nNo shops were allowed in these select streets, except that in some\r\nsmall wooden house, belonging to the parish church, a tiny grocer’s or\r\ngreengrocer’s shop might have been found; but then, the policeman’s\r\nlodge stood on the opposite corner, and in the daytime the policeman\r\nhimself, armed with a halberd, would appear at the door to salute\r\nwith his inoffensive weapon the officers passing by, and would retire\r\ninside when dusk came, to employ himself either as a cobbler or in the\r\nmanufacture of some special stuff patronized by the elder servants of\r\nthe neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nLife went on quietly and peacefully--at least for the outsider--in\r\nthis Moscow Faubourg Saint-Germain. In the morning nobody was seen in\r\nthe streets. About midday the children made their appearance under the\r\nguidance of French tutors and German nurses, who took them out for a\r\nwalk on the snow-covered boulevards. Later on in the day the ladies\r\nmight be seen in their two-horse sledges, with a valet standing behind\r\non a small plank fastened at the end of the runners, or ensconced in\r\nan old-fashioned carriage, immense and high, suspended on big curved\r\nsprings and dragged by four horses, with a postillion in front and two\r\nvalets standing behind. In the evening most of the houses were brightly\r\nilluminated, and, the blinds not being drawn down, the passer-by could\r\nadmire the card-players or the waltzers in the saloons. ‘Opinions’\r\nwere not in vogue in those days, and we were yet far from the years\r\nwhen in each one of these houses a struggle began between ‘fathers and\r\nsons’--a struggle that usually ended either in a family tragedy or in\r\na nocturnal visit of the state police. Fifty years ago nothing of the\r\nsort was thought of; all was quiet and smooth--at least on the surface.\r\n\r\nIn this Old Equerries’ Quarter I was born in 1842, and here I passed\r\nthe first fifteen years of my life. Even after our father had sold\r\nthe house in which our mother died, and bought another, and when again\r\nhe had sold that house, and we spent several winters in hired houses,\r\nuntil he had found a third one to his taste within a stone’s-throw of\r\nthe church where he had been baptized, we still remained in the Old\r\nEquerries’ Quarter, leaving it only during the summer to go to our\r\ncountry-seat.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nA high, spacious bedroom, the corner room of our house, with a wide bed\r\nupon which our mother is lying, our baby chairs and tables standing\r\nclose by, and the neatly served tables covered with sweets and jellies\r\nin pretty glass jars--a room into which we children are ushered at a\r\nstrange hour---this is the first half-distinct reminiscence of my life.\r\n\r\nOur mother was dying of consumption; she was only thirty-five years\r\nold. Before parting with us for ever, she had wished to have us by her\r\nside, to caress us, to feel happy for a moment in our joys, and she had\r\narranged this little treat by the side of her bed which she could leave\r\nno more, I remember her pale thin face, her large, dark brown eyes. She\r\nlooked at us with love, and invited us to eat, to climb upon her bed;\r\nthen suddenly she burst into tears and began to cough, and we were told\r\nto go.\r\n\r\nSome time after, we children--that is, my brother Alexander and\r\nmyself--were removed from the big house to a small side house in the\r\ncourtyard. The April sun filled the little rooms with its rays, but\r\nour German nurse Madame Búrman and Uliána, our Russian nurse, told\r\nus to go to bed. Their faces wet with tears, they were sewing for us\r\nblack shirts fringed with broad white tassels. We could not sleep: the\r\nunknown frightened us, and we listened to their subdued talk. They said\r\nsomething about our mother which we could not understand. We jumped\r\nout of our beds, asking, ‘Where is mamma? Where is mamma?’\r\n\r\nBoth of them burst into sobs, and began to pat our curly heads, calling\r\nus ‘poor orphans,’ until Uliána could hold out no longer, and said,\r\n‘Your mother is gone there--to the sky, to the angels.’\r\n\r\n‘How to the sky? Why?’ our infantile imagination in vain demanded.\r\n\r\nThis was in April 1846. I was only three and a half years old, and\r\nmy brother Sásha not yet five. Where our elder brother and sister,\r\nNicholas and Hélène, had gone I do not know: perhaps they were already\r\nat school. Nicholas was twelve years old, Hélène was eleven; they kept\r\ntogether, and we knew them but little. So we remained, Alexander and\r\nI, in this little house, in the hands of Madame Búrman and Uliána.\r\nThe good old German lady, homeless and absolutely alone in the wide\r\nworld, took toward us the place of our mother. She brought us up as\r\nwell as she could, buying us from time to time some simple toys, and\r\noverfeeding us with ginger cakes whenever another old German, who used\r\nto sell such cakes--probably as homeless and solitary as herself--paid\r\nan occasional visit to our house. We seldom saw our father, and the\r\nnext two years passed without leaving any impression on my memory.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nOur father was very proud of the origin of his family, and would point\r\nwith solemnity to a piece of parchment which hung on the wall of his\r\nstudy. It was decorated with our arms--the arms of the principality\r\nof Smolénsk covered with the ermine mantle and the crown of the\r\nMonomáchs--and there was written on it, and certified by the Heraldry\r\nDepartment, that our family originated with a grandson of Rostisláv\r\nMstislávich the Bold (a name familiar in Russian history as that of a\r\nGrand Prince of Kíeff), and that our ancestors had been Grand Princes\r\nof Smolénsk.\r\n\r\n‘It cost me three hundred roubles to obtain that parchment,’ our father\r\nused to say. Like most people of his generation, he was not much versed\r\nin Russian history, and valued the parchment more for its cost than for\r\nits historical associations.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, our family is of very ancient origin indeed; but,\r\nlike most descendants of Rurik who may be regarded as representative of\r\nthe feudal period of Russian history, it was driven into the background\r\nwhen that period ended, and the Románoffs, enthroned at Moscow, began\r\nthe work of consolidating the Russian state. In recent times, none of\r\nthe Kropótkins seem to have had any special liking for state functions.\r\nOur great-grandfather and grandfather both retired from the military\r\nservice when quite young men, and hastened to return to their family\r\nestates. It must also be said that of these estates the main one,\r\nUrúsovo, situated in the government of Ryazán, on a high hill at the\r\nborder of fertile prairies, might tempt any one by the beauty of its\r\nshadowy forests, its winding rivers, and its endless meadows. Our\r\ngrandfather was only a lieutenant when he left the service, and retired\r\nto Urúsovo, devoting himself to his estate, and to the purchase of\r\nother estates in the neighbouring provinces.\r\n\r\nProbably our generation would have done the same; but our grandfather\r\nmarried a Princess Gagárin, who belonged to a quite different family.\r\nHer brother was well known as a passionate lover of the stage. He kept\r\na private theatre of his own, and went so far in his passion as to\r\nmarry, to the scandal of all his relations, a serf--the genial actress\r\nSemyónova, who was one of the creators of dramatic art in Russia, and\r\nundoubtedly one of its most sympathetic figures. To the horror of ‘all\r\nMoscow,’ she continued to appear on the stage.\r\n\r\nI do not know if our grandmother had the same artistic and literary\r\ntastes as her brother--I remember her when she was already paralyzed\r\nand could speak only in whispers; but it is certain that in the next\r\ngeneration a leaning toward literature became a characteristic of our\r\nfamily. One of the sons of the Princess Gagárin was a minor Russian\r\npoet, and issued a book of poems--a fact which my father was ashamed\r\nof and always avoided mentioning; and in our own generation several of\r\nour cousins, as well as my brother and myself, have contributed more or\r\nless to the literature of our period.\r\n\r\nOur father was a typical officer of the time of Nicholas I. Not that\r\nhe was imbued with a warlike spirit or much in love with camp life;\r\nI doubt whether he spent a single night of his life at a bivouac\r\nfire, or took part in one battle. But under Nicholas I. that was of\r\nquite secondary importance. The true military man of those times was\r\nthe officer who was enamoured of the military uniform and utterly\r\ndespised all other sorts of attire; whose soldiers were trained to\r\nperform almost superhuman tricks with their legs and rifles (to break\r\nthe wood of the rifle into pieces while ‘presenting arms’ was one of\r\nthose famous tricks); and who could show on parade a row of soldiers\r\nas perfectly aligned and as motionless as a row of toy-soldiers, ‘Very\r\ngood,’ the Grand Duke Mikhael said once of a regiment, after having\r\nkept it for one hour presenting arms--‘only _they breathe_!’ To respond\r\nto the then current conception of a military man was certainly our\r\nfather’s ideal.\r\n\r\nTrue, he took part in the Turkish campaign of 1828; but he managed to\r\nremain all the time on the staff of the chief commander; and if we\r\nchildren, taking advantage of a moment when he was in a particularly\r\ngood temper, asked him to tell us something about the war, he had\r\nnothing to tell but of a fierce attack of hundreds of Turkish dogs\r\nwhich one night assailed him and his faithful servant, Frol, as they\r\nwere riding with despatches through an abandoned Turkish village.\r\nThey had to use swords to extricate themselves from the hungry beasts.\r\nBands of Turks would assuredly have better satisfied our imagination,\r\nbut we accepted the dogs as a substitute. When, however, pressed by our\r\nquestions, our father told us how he had won the cross of Saint Anne\r\n‘for gallantry,’ and the golden sword which he wore, I must confess\r\nwe felt really disappointed. His story was decidedly too prosaic. The\r\nofficers of the general staff were lodged in a Turkish village, when\r\nit took fire. In a moment the houses were enveloped in flames, and in\r\none of them a child had been left behind. Its mother uttered despairing\r\ncries. Thereupon, Frol, who always accompanied his master, rushed into\r\nthe flames and saved the child. The chief commander, who saw the act,\r\nat once gave father the cross for gallantry.\r\n\r\n‘But, father,’ we exclaimed, ‘it was Frol who saved the child!’\r\n\r\n‘What of that?’ replied he, in the most naïve way. ‘Was he not my man?\r\nIt is all the same.’\r\n\r\nHe also took some part in the campaign of 1831, during the Polish\r\nRevolution, and in Warsaw he made the acquaintance of, and fell in love\r\nwith, the youngest daughter of the commander of an army corps, General\r\nSulíma. The marriage was celebrated with great pomp, in the Lazienki\r\npalace; the lieutenant-governor, Count Paskiéwich, acting as nuptial\r\ngodfather on the bridegroom’s side. ‘But your mother,’ our father used\r\nto add, ‘brought me no fortune whatever.’\r\n\r\nWhich was true. Her father, Nikolái Semyónovich Sulíma, was not versed\r\nin the art of making a career or a fortune. He must have had in him too\r\nmuch of the blood of those Cossacks of the Dnyéper, who knew how to\r\nfight the well-equipped, warlike Poles or armies of the Turks, three\r\ntimes more than themselves, but knew not how to avoid the snares of\r\nthe Moscow diplomacy, and, after having fought against the Poles in\r\nthe terrible insurrection of 1648, which was the beginning of the end\r\nfor the Polish republic, lost all their liberties in falling under the\r\ndominion of the Russian Tsars. One Sulíma was captured by the Poles\r\nand tortured to death at Warsaw, but the other ‘colonels’ of the same\r\nstock only fought the more fiercely on that account, and Poland lost\r\nLittle Russia. As to our grandfather, he knew how, with his regiment\r\nof cuirassiers during Napoleon I.’s invasion, to cut his way into a\r\nFrench infantry square bristling with bayonets, and to recover, after\r\nhaving been left for dead on the battlefield, with a deep cut in his\r\nhead; but he could not become a valet to the favourite of Alexander I.,\r\nthe omnipotent Arakchéeff, and was consequently sent into a sort of\r\nhonorary exile, first as a governor-general of West Siberia, and later\r\nof East Siberia. In those times such a position was considered more\r\nlucrative than a gold-mine, but our grandfather returned from Siberia\r\nas poor as he went, and left only modest fortunes to his three sons and\r\nthree daughters. When I went to Siberia, in 1862, I often heard his\r\nname mentioned with respect. He was almost driven to despair by the\r\nwholesale stealing which went on in those provinces, and which he had\r\nno means to repress.\r\n\r\nOur mother was undoubtedly a remarkable woman for the times she\r\nlived in. Many years after her death I discovered, in a corner of a\r\nstoreroom of our country house, a mass of papers covered with her firm\r\nbut pretty handwriting: diaries in which she wrote with delight of\r\nthe scenery of Germany, and spoke of her sorrows and her thirst for\r\nhappiness; books which she had filled with Russian verses prohibited by\r\ncensorship--among them the beautiful historical ballads of Ryléeff, the\r\npoet, whom Nicholas I. hanged in 1826; other books containing music,\r\nFrench dramas, verses of Lamartine, and Byron’s poems that she had\r\ncopied; and a great number of water-colour paintings.\r\n\r\nTall, slim, adorned with a mass of dark chestnut hair, with dark\r\nbrown eyes and a tiny mouth, she looks quite lifelike in a portrait\r\nin oils that was painted _con amore_ by a good artist. Always lively\r\nand often careless, she was fond of dancing, and the peasant women in\r\nour village would tell us how she would admire from a balcony their\r\nring-dances--slow and full of grace--and how finally she would herself\r\njoin in them. She had the nature of an artist. It was at a ball that\r\nshe caught the cold that produced the inflammation of the lungs which\r\nbrought her to the grave.\r\n\r\nAll who knew her loved her. The servants worshipped her memory. It was\r\nin her name that Madame Búrman took care of us, and in her name the\r\nRussian nurse bestowed upon us her love. While combing our hair, or\r\nsigning us with the cross in our beds, Uliána would often say, ‘And\r\nyour mamma must now look upon you from the skies, and shed tears on\r\nseeing you, poor orphans.’ Our whole childhood is irradiated by her\r\nmemory. How often in some dark passage, the hand of a servant would\r\ntouch Alexander or me with a caress; or a peasant woman, on meeting us\r\nin the fields, would ask, ‘Will you be as good as your mother was? She\r\ntook compassion on us. You will, surely.’ ‘Us’ meant, of course, the\r\nserfs. I do not know what would have become of us if we had not found\r\nin our house, amidst the serf servants, that atmosphere of love which\r\nchildren must have around them. We were her children, we bore likeness\r\nto her, and they lavished their care upon us, sometimes in a touching\r\nform, as will be seen later on.\r\n\r\nMen passionately desire to live after death, but they often pass\r\naway without noticing the fact that the memory of a really good\r\nperson always lives. It is impressed upon the next generation, and is\r\ntransmitted again to the children. Is not that an immortality worth\r\nstriving for?\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTwo years after the death of our mother our father married again. He\r\nhad already cast his eyes upon a nice-looking young person, this time\r\nbelonging to a wealthy family, when the fates decided another way. One\r\nmorning, while he was still in his dressing-gown, the servants rushed\r\nmadly into his room, announcing the arrival of General Timoféeff, the\r\ncommander of the sixth army corps, to which our father belonged. This\r\nfavourite of Nicholas I. was a terrible man. He would order a soldier\r\nto be flogged almost to death for a mistake made during a parade, or he\r\nwould degrade an officer and send him as a private to Siberia because\r\nhe had met him in the street with the hooks on his high, stiff collar\r\nunfastened. With Nicholas General Timoféeff’s word was all-powerful.\r\n\r\nThe general, who had never before been in our house, came to propose to\r\nour father to marry his wife’s niece, Mademoiselle Elisabeth Karandinó,\r\none of several daughters of an admiral of the Black Sea fleet--a young\r\nlady with a classical Greek profile, said to have been very beautiful.\r\nFather accepted, and his second wedding, like the first, was solemnized\r\nwith great pomp.\r\n\r\n‘You young people understand nothing of this kind of thing,’ he said in\r\nconclusion, after having told me the story more than once, with a very\r\nfine humour which I will not attempt to reproduce. ‘But do you know\r\nwhat it meant at that time, the commander of an army corps--above all\r\nthat one-eyed devil, as we used to call him--coming himself to propose?\r\nOf course she had no dowry; only a big trunk filled with ladies’\r\nfinery, and that Martha, her one serf, dark as a gypsy, sitting upon\r\nit.’\r\n\r\nI have no recollection whatever of this event. I only remember a big\r\ndrawing-room in a richly furnished house, and in that room a young\r\nlady, attractive but with a rather too sharp southern look, gambolling\r\nwith us, and saying, ‘You see what a jolly mamma you will have;’ to\r\nwhich Sásha and I, sulkily looking at her, replied, ‘Our mamma has\r\nflown away to the sky.’ We regarded so much liveliness with suspicion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWinter came, and a new life began for us. Our house was sold and\r\nanother was bought and furnished completely anew. All that could convey\r\na reminiscence of our mother disappeared--her portraits, her paintings,\r\nher embroideries. In vain Madame Búrman implored to be retained in\r\nour house, and promised to devote herself to the baby our stepmother\r\nwas expecting as to her own child: she was sent away. ‘Nothing of the\r\nSulímas in my house,’ she was told. All connection with our uncles\r\nand aunts and our grandmother was broken. Uliána was married to Frol,\r\nwho became a major-domo, while she was made housekeeper; and for our\r\neducation a richly paid French tutor, M. Poulain, and a miserably paid\r\nRussian student, N. P. Smirnóff, were engaged.\r\n\r\nMany of the sons of the Moscow nobles were educated at that time by\r\nFrenchmen, who represented the débris of Napoleon’s Grande Armée. M.\r\nPoulain was one of them. He had just finished the education of the\r\nyoungest son of the novelist Zagóskin; and his pupil, Serge, enjoyed\r\nin the Old Equerries’ Quarter the reputation of being so well brought\r\nup that our father did not hesitate to engage M. Poulain for the\r\nconsiderable sum of six hundred roubles a year.\r\n\r\nM. Poulain brought with him his setter, Trésor, his coffee-pot\r\nNapoléon, and his French text-books, and he began to rule over us and\r\nthe serf Matvéi who was attached to our service.\r\n\r\nHis plan of education was very simple. After having woke us up he\r\nattended to his coffee, which he used to take in his room. While we\r\nwere preparing the morning lessons he made his toilet with minute care:\r\nhe shampooed his grey hair so as to conceal his growing baldness, put\r\non his tail-coat, sprinkled and washed himself with eau-de-cologne,\r\nand then escorted us downstairs to say good-morning to our parents. We\r\nused to find our father and stepmother at breakfast, and on approaching\r\nthem we recited in the most ceremonious manner, ‘Bonjour, mon cher\r\npapa,’ and ‘Bonjour, ma chère maman,’ and kissed their hands. M.\r\nPoulain made a very complicated and elegant obeisance in pronouncing\r\nthe words, ‘Bonjour, monsieur le prince,’ and ‘Bonjour, madame la\r\nprincesse,’ after which the procession immediately withdrew and retired\r\nupstairs. This ceremony was repeated every morning.\r\n\r\nThen our work began. M. Poulain changed his tail-coat for a\r\ndressing-gown, covered his head with a leather cap, and dropping into\r\nan easy-chair said ‘Recite the lesson.’\r\n\r\nWe recited it ‘by heart’ from one mark which was made in the book with\r\nthe nail to the next mark. M. Poulain had brought with him the grammar\r\nof Noël and Chapsal, memorable to more than one generation of Russian\r\nboys and girls; a book of French dialogues; a history of the world,\r\nin one volume; and a universal geography, also in one volume. We had\r\nto commit to memory the grammar, the dialogues, the history, and the\r\ngeography.\r\n\r\nThe grammar, with its well-known sentences, ‘What is grammar?’ ‘The art\r\nof speaking and writing correctly,’ went all right. But the history\r\nbook, unfortunately, had a preface, which contained an enumeration\r\nof all the advantages which can be derived from a knowledge of\r\nhistory. Things went on smoothly enough with the first sentences. We\r\nrecited: ‘The prince finds in it magnanimous examples for governing\r\nhis subjects; the military commander learns from it the noble art\r\nof warfare.’ But the moment we came to law all went wrong. ‘The\r\njurisconsult meets in it’--but what the learned lawyer meets in history\r\nwe never came to know. That terrible word ‘jurisconsult’ spoiled all\r\nthe game. As soon as we reached it we stopped.\r\n\r\n‘On your knees, _gros pouff_!’ exclaimed Poulain. (That was for me.)\r\n‘On your knees, _grand dada_!’ (That was for my brother.) And there we\r\nknelt, shedding tears and vainly endeavouring to learn all about the\r\njurisconsult.\r\n\r\nIt cost us many pains, that preface! We were already learning all about\r\nthe Romans, and used to put our sticks in Uliána’s scales when she was\r\nweighing rice, ‘just like Brennus;’ we jumped from our table and other\r\nprecipices for the salvation of our country, in imitation of Curtius;\r\nbut M. Poulain would still from time to time return to the preface,\r\nand again put us on our knees for that very same jurisconsult. Was\r\nit strange that later on both my brother and I should entertain an\r\nundisguised contempt for jurisprudence?\r\n\r\nI do not know what would have happened with geography if M. Poulain’s\r\nbook had had a preface. But happily the first twenty pages of the book\r\nhad been torn away (Serge Zagóskin, I suppose, rendered us that notable\r\nservice), and so our lessons commenced with the twenty-first page,\r\nwhich began, ‘of the rivers which water France.’\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed that things did not always end with kneeling.\r\nThere was in the class-room a birch rod, and Poulain resorted to it\r\nwhen there was no hope of progress with the preface or with some\r\ndialogue on virtue and propriety; but one day sister Hélène, who by\r\nthis time had left the Catherine Institut des Demoiselles, and now\r\noccupied a room underneath ours, hearing our cries, rushed, all in\r\ntears, into our father’s study, and bitterly reproached him with having\r\nhanded us over to our stepmother, who had abandoned us to ‘a retired\r\nFrench drummer.’ ‘Of course,’ she cried, ‘there is no one to take their\r\npart, but I cannot see my brothers being treated in this way by a\r\ndrummer!’\r\n\r\nTaken thus unprepared, our father could not make a stand. He began to\r\nscold Hélène, but ended by approving her devotion to her brothers.\r\nThereafter the birch rod was reserved for teaching the rules of\r\npropriety to the setter, Trésor.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had M. Poulain discharged himself of his heavy educational\r\nduties than he became quite another man--a lively comrade instead of a\r\ngruesome teacher. After lunch he took us out for a walk, and there was\r\nno end to his tales: we chattered like birds. Though we never went with\r\nhim beyond the first pages of syntax, we soon learned, nevertheless,\r\n‘to speak correctly;’ we used to _think_ in French; and when he had\r\ndictated to us half through a book of mythology, correcting our faults\r\nby the book, without ever trying to explain to us why a word must be\r\nwritten in a particular way, we had learned ‘to write correctly.’\r\n\r\nAfter dinner we had our lesson with the Russian teacher, a student of\r\nthe faculty of law in the Moscow University. He taught us all ‘Russian’\r\nsubjects--grammar, arithmetic, history, and so on. But in those years\r\nserious teaching had not yet begun. In the meantime he dictated to\r\nus every day a page of history, and in that practical way we quickly\r\nlearned to write Russian quite correctly.\r\n\r\nOur best time was on Sundays, when all the family, with the exception\r\nof us children, went to dine with Madame la Générale Timoféeff.\r\nIt would also happen occasionally that both M. Poulain and N. P.\r\nSmirnóff would be allowed to leave the house, and when this occurred\r\nwe were placed under the care of Uliána. After a hurriedly eaten\r\ndinner we hastened to the great hall, to which the younger housemaids\r\nsoon repaired. All sorts of games were started--blind man, vulture\r\nand chickens, and so on; and then, all of a sudden, Tíkhon, the\r\nJack-of-all-trades, would appear with a violin. Dancing began;\r\nnot that measured and tiresome dancing, under the direction of a\r\nFrench dancing-master ‘on india-rubber legs,’ which made part of our\r\neducation, but free dancing which was not a lesson, and in which a\r\nscore of couples turned round any way; and this was only preparatory\r\nto the still more animated and rather wild Cossack dance. Tíkhon\r\nwould then hand the violin to one of the older men, and would begin to\r\nperform with his legs such wonderful feats that the doors leading to\r\nthe hall would soon be filled by the cooks and even the coachmen, who\r\ncame to see the dance so dear to the Russian heart.\r\n\r\nAbout nine o’clock the big carriage was sent to fetch the family\r\nhome. Tíkhon, brush in hand, crawled on the floor, to make it shine\r\nwith its virgin glance, and perfect order was restored in the house.\r\nAnd if, next morning, we two had been submitted to the most severe\r\ncross-examination, not a word would have been dropped concerning the\r\nprevious evening’s amusements. We never would have betrayed any one of\r\nthe servants, nor would they have betrayed us. One Sunday, my brother\r\nand I, playing alone in the wide hall, ran against a bracket which\r\nsupported a costly lamp. The lamp was broken to pieces. Immediately a\r\ncouncil was held by the servants. No one scolded us; but it was decided\r\nthat early next morning Tíkhon should at his risk and peril slip out of\r\nthe house and run to the Smiths’ Bridge in order to buy another lamp\r\nof the same pattern. It cost fifteen roubles--an enormous sum for the\r\nservants; but it was done, and we never heard a word of reproach about\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWhen I think of it now, and all these scenes come back to my memory,\r\nI notice that we never heard coarse language in any of the games, nor\r\nsaw in the dances anything like the kind of dancing which children\r\nare now taken to admire in the theatres. In the servants’ house,\r\namong themselves, they assuredly used coarse expressions; but we were\r\nchildren--_her_ children--and that protected us from anything of the\r\nsort.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn those days children were not bewildered by a profusion of toys, as\r\nthey are now. We had almost none, and were thus compelled to rely upon\r\nour own inventiveness. Besides, we both had early acquired a taste for\r\nthe theatre. The inferior carnival theatres, with the thieving and\r\nfighting shows, produced no lasting impression upon us: we ourselves\r\nplayed enough at robbers and soldiers. But the great star of the\r\nballet, Fanny Elssler, came to Moscow, and we saw her. When father\r\ntook a box in the theatre, he always secured one of the best, and paid\r\nfor it well; but then he insisted that all the members of the family\r\nshould enjoy it to its full value. Small though I was at that time,\r\nFanny Elssler left upon me the impression of a being so full of grace,\r\nso light, and so artistic in all her movements, that ever since I have\r\nbeen unable to feel the slightest interest in a dance which belongs\r\nmore to the domain of gymnastics than to the domain of art.\r\n\r\nOf course the ballet that we saw--‘Gitana,’ the Spanish Gypsy--had to\r\nbe repeated at home; its substance, not the dances. We had a ready-made\r\nstage, as the doorway which led from our bedroom into the class-room\r\nhad a curtain instead of a door. A few chairs put in a half-circle in\r\nfront of the curtain, with an easy-chair for M. Poulain, became the\r\nhall and the imperial box, and an audience could easily be mustered\r\nwith the Russian teacher, Uliána, and a couple of maids from the\r\nservants’ rooms.\r\n\r\nTwo scenes of the ballet had to be represented by some means or\r\nother: the one where the little Gitana is brought by the gypsies into\r\ntheir camp in a wheelbarrow, and that in which Gitana makes her first\r\nappearance on the stage, descending from a hill and crossing a bridge\r\nover a brook which reflects her image. The audience burst into frantic\r\napplause at this point, and the cheers were evidently called forth--so\r\nwe thought, at least--by the reflection in the brook.\r\n\r\nWe found our Gitana in one of the youngest girls in the maid-servants’\r\nroom. Her rather shabby blue cotton dress was no obstacle to\r\npersonifying Fanny Elssler. An overturned chair, pushed along by\r\nits legs, head downwards, was an acceptable substitute for the\r\nwheelbarrow. But the brook! Two chairs and the long ironing-board of\r\nAndréi, the tailor, made the bridge, and a piece of blue cotton made\r\nthe brook. The image in the brook, however, would not appear full size,\r\ndo what we might with M. Poulain’s little shaving-glass. After many\r\nunsuccessful endeavours we had to give it up, but we bribed Uliána to\r\nbehave as if she saw the image, and to applaud loudly at this passage,\r\nso that finally we began to believe that perhaps something of it could\r\nbe seen.\r\n\r\nRacine’s ‘Phèdre,’ or at least the last act of it, also went off\r\nnicely; that is, Sásha recited the melodious verses beautifully--\r\n\r\n    A peine nous sortions des portes de Trézène;\r\n\r\nand I sat absolutely motionless and unconcerned during the whole length\r\nof the tragic monologue intended to apprise me of the death of my son,\r\ndown to the place where, according to the book, I had to exclaim, ‘_O\r\ndieux!_’\r\n\r\nBut whatsoever we might impersonate, all our performances invariably\r\nended with hell. All candles save one were put out, and this one was\r\nplaced behind a transparent paper to imitate flames, while my brother\r\nand I, concealed from view, howled in the most appalling way as the\r\ncondemned. Uliána, who did not like to have any allusion to the evil\r\none made at bedtime, looked horrified; but I ask myself now whether\r\nthis extremely concrete representation of hell, with a candle and a\r\nsheet of paper, did not contribute to free us both at an early age from\r\nthe fear of eternal fire. Our conception of it was too realistic to\r\nresist scepticism.\r\n\r\nI must have been very much of a child when I saw the great Moscow\r\nactors: Schépkin, Sadóvskiy, and Shúmski, in Gógol’s _Revisór_ and\r\nanother comedy; still, I remember not only the salient scenes of the\r\ntwo plays, but even the attitudes and expressions of these great\r\nactors of the realistic school which is now so admirably represented by\r\nDuse. I remembered them so well that when I saw the same plays given at\r\nSt. Petersburg by actors belonging to the French declamatory school, I\r\nfound no pleasure in their acting, always comparing them with Schépkin\r\nand Sadóvskiy, by whom my taste in dramatic art was settled.\r\n\r\nThis makes me think that parents who wish to develop artistic taste in\r\ntheir children ought to take them occasionally to really well-acted,\r\ngood plays, instead of feeding them on a profusion of so-called\r\n‘children’s pantomimes.’\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nWhen I was in my eighth year, the next step in my career was taken,\r\nin a quite unforeseen way. I do not know exactly on what occasion\r\nit happened, but probably it was on the twenty-fifth anniversary of\r\nNicholas I.’s reign, when great festivities were arranged at Moscow.\r\nThe imperial family were coming to the old capital, and the Moscow\r\nnobility intended to celebrate this event by a fancy-dress ball in\r\nwhich children were to play an important part. It was agreed that the\r\nwhole motley crowd of nationalities of which the population of the\r\nRussian Empire is composed should be represented at this ball to greet\r\nthe monarch. Great preparations went on in our house, as well as in\r\nall the houses of our neighbourhood. Some sort of remarkable Russian\r\ncostume was made for our stepmother. Our father, being a military man,\r\nhad to appear, of course, in his uniform; but those of our relatives\r\nwho were not in the military service were as busy with their Russian,\r\nGreek, Caucasian, and Mongolian costumes, as the ladies themselves.\r\nWhen the Moscow nobility gives a ball to the imperial family, it must\r\nbe something extraordinary. As for my brother Alexander and myself, we\r\nwere considered too young to take part in so important a ceremonial.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, after all, I did take part in it. Our mother was an intimate\r\nfriend of Madame Nazímoff, the wife of the general who was Governor\r\nof Wilno when the emancipation of the serfs began to be spoken of.\r\nMadame Nazímoff, who was a very beautiful woman, was expected to be\r\npresent at the ball with her child, about ten years old, and to wear\r\nsome wonderful costume of a Persian princess in harmony with which\r\nthe costume of a young Persian prince, exceedingly rich, with a belt\r\ncovered with jewels, was made ready for her son. But the boy fell ill\r\njust before the ball, and Madame Nazímoff thought that one of the\r\nchildren of her best friend would be a good substitute for her own\r\nchild. Alexander and I were taken to her house to try on the costume.\r\nIt proved to be too short for Alexander, who was much taller than I,\r\nbut it fitted me exactly, and therefore it was decided that I should\r\nimpersonate the Persian prince.\r\n\r\nThe immense hall of the House of the Moscow nobility was crowded with\r\nguests. Each of the children received a standard bearing at its top\r\nthe arms of one of the sixty provinces of the Russian Empire. I had an\r\neagle floating over a blue sea, which represented, as I learned later\r\non, the arms of the government of Astrakhan, on the Caspian Sea. We\r\nwere then ranged at the back of the great hall, and slowly marched in\r\ntwo rows toward the raised platform upon which the Emperor and his\r\nfamily stood. As we reached it we went right and left, and thus stood\r\naligned in one row before the platform. At a given signal all standards\r\nwere lowered before the Emperor. The apotheosis of autocracy was made\r\nmost impressive: Nicholas was enchanted. All provinces of the Empire\r\nworshipped the supreme ruler. Then we children slowly retired to the\r\nrear of the hall.\r\n\r\nBut here some confusion occurred. Chamberlains in their\r\ngold-embroidered uniforms were running about, and I was taken out of\r\nthe ranks; my uncle, Prince Gagárin, dressed as a Tungus (I was dizzy\r\nwith admiration of his fine leather coat, his bow, and his quiver full\r\nof arrows), lifted me up in his arms, and planted me on the imperial\r\nplatform.\r\n\r\nWhether it was because I was the tiniest in the row of boys, or that\r\nmy round face, framed in curls, looked funny under the high Astrakhan\r\nfur bonnet I wore, I know not, but Nicholas wanted to have me on the\r\nplatform; and there I stood amidst generals and ladies looking down\r\nupon me with curiosity. I was told later on that Nicholas I., who was\r\nalways fond of barrack jokes, took me by the arm, and, leading me to\r\nMarie Alexándrovna (the wife of the heir to the throne), who was then\r\nexpecting her third child, said in his military way, ‘That is the sort\r\nof boy you must bring me’--a joke which made her blush deeply. I well\r\nremember, at any rate, Nicholas asking me whether I would have sweets;\r\nbut I replied that I should like to have some of those tiny biscuits\r\nwhich were served with tea (we were never overfed at home), and he\r\ncalled a waiter and emptied a full tray into my tall bonnet. ‘I will\r\ntake them to Sásha,’ I said to him.\r\n\r\nHowever, the soldier-like brother of Nicholas, Mikhael, who had the\r\nreputation of being a wit, managed to make me cry. ‘When you are a good\r\nboy,’ he said, ‘they treat you so,’ and he passed his big hand over my\r\nface downwards; ‘but when you are naughty, they treat you so,’ and he\r\npassed the hand upwards, rubbing my nose, which already had a marked\r\ntendency toward growing in that direction. Tears, which I vainly tried\r\nto stop, came into my eyes. The ladies at once took my part, and the\r\ngood-hearted Marie Alexándrovna took me under her protection. She set\r\nme by her side, in a high velvet chair with a gilded back, and our\r\npeople told me afterward that I very soon put my head in her lap and\r\nwent to sleep. She did not leave her chair during the whole time the\r\nball was going on.\r\n\r\nI remember also that, as we were waiting in the entrance-hall for our\r\ncarriage, our relatives petted and kissed me, saying, ‘Pétya, you have\r\nbeen made a page;’ but I answered, ‘I am not a page; I will go home,’\r\nand was very anxious about my bonnet which contained the pretty little\r\nbiscuits that I was taking home for Sásha.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether Sásha got many of those biscuits, but I recollect\r\nwhat a hug he gave me when he was told about my anxiety concerning the\r\nbonnet.\r\n\r\nTo be inscribed as a candidate for the corps of pages was then a great\r\nfavour, which Nicholas seldom bestowed on the Moscow nobility. My\r\nfather was delighted, and already dreamed of a brilliant court career\r\nfor his son. Our stepmother, every time she told the story, never\r\nfailed to add, ‘It is all because I gave him my blessing before he went\r\nto the ball.’\r\n\r\nMadame Nazímoff was delighted too, and insisted upon having her\r\nportrait painted in the costume in which she looked so beautiful, with\r\nme standing at her side.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy brother Alexander’s fate, also, was decided next year. The jubilee\r\nof the Izmáylovsk regiment, to which my father had belonged in his\r\nyouth, was celebrated about this time at St. Petersburg. One night,\r\nwhile all the household was plunged in deep sleep, a three-horse\r\ncarriage, ringing with the bells attached to the harnesses, stopped at\r\nour gate. A man jumped out of it, loudly shouting, ‘Open! An ordinance\r\nfrom his Majesty the Emperor.’\r\n\r\nOne can easily imagine the terror which this nocturnal visit\r\nspread in our house. My father, trembling, went down to his study.\r\n‘Court-martial, degradation as a soldier,’ were words which rang\r\nthen in the ears of every military man; it was a terrible epoch.\r\nBut Nicholas simply wanted to have the names of the sons of all the\r\nofficers who had once belonged to the regiment, in order to send the\r\nboys to military schools, if that had not yet been done. A special\r\nmessenger had been dispatched for that purpose from St. Petersburg\r\nto Moscow, and now he called day and night at the houses of the\r\nex-Izmáylovsk officers.\r\n\r\nWith a shaking hand my father wrote that his eldest son, Nicholas,\r\nwas already in the first corps of cadets at Moscow; that his youngest\r\nson, Peter, was a candidate for the corps of pages; and that there\r\nremained only his second son, Alexander, who had not yet entered the\r\nmilitary career. A few weeks later came a paper informing father of the\r\n‘monarch’s favour.’ Alexander was ordered to enter a corps of cadets\r\nin Orel, a small provincial town. It cost my father a deal of trouble\r\nand a large sum of money to get Alexander sent to a corps of cadets at\r\nMoscow. This new ‘favour’ was obtained only in consideration of the\r\nfact that our elder brother was in that corps.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, owing to the will of Nicholas I., we had both to receive a\r\nmilitary education, though, before we were many years older, we simply\r\nhated the military career for its absurdity. But Nicholas I. was\r\nwatchful that none of the sons of the nobility should embrace any other\r\nprofession than the military one, unless they were of infirm health;\r\nand so we had all three to be officers, to the great satisfaction of my\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nWealth was measured in those times by the number of ‘souls’ which a\r\nlanded proprietor owned. So many ‘souls’ meant so many male serfs:\r\nwomen did not count. My father, who owned nearly twelve hundred souls,\r\nin three different provinces, and who had, in addition to his peasants’\r\nholdings, large tracts of land which were cultivated by these peasants,\r\nwas accounted a rich man. He lived up to his reputation, which meant\r\nthat his house was open to any number of visitors, and that he kept a\r\nvery large household.\r\n\r\nWe were a family of eight, occasionally of ten or twelve; but fifty\r\nservants at Moscow, and half as many more in the country, were\r\nconsidered not one too many. Four coachmen to attend a dozen horses,\r\nthree cooks for the masters and two more for the servants, a dozen\r\nmen to wait upon us at dinner-time (one man, plate in hand, standing\r\nbehind each person seated at the table), and girls innumerable in the\r\nmaid-servants’ room,--how could anyone do with less than this?\r\n\r\nBesides, the ambition of every landed proprietor was that everything\r\nrequired for his household should be made at home by his own men.\r\n\r\n‘How nicely your piano is always tuned! I suppose Herr Schimmel must be\r\nyour tuner?’ perhaps a visitor would remark.\r\n\r\nTo be able to answer, ‘I have my own piano-tuner,’ was in those times\r\nthe correct thing.\r\n\r\n‘What beautiful pastry!’ the guests would exclaim, when a work of\r\nart, composed of ices and pastry, appeared toward the end of the\r\ndinner. ‘Confess, prince, that it comes from Tremblé’ (the fashionable\r\npastry-cook).\r\n\r\n‘It is made by my own confectioner, a pupil of Tremblé, whom I have\r\nallowed to show what he can do,’ was a reply which elicited general\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\nTo have embroideries, harnesses, furniture--in fact, everything--made\r\nby one’s own men was the ideal of the rich and respected landed\r\nproprietor. As soon as the children of the servants attained the age\r\nof ten, they were sent as apprentices to the fashionable shops, where\r\nthey were obliged to spend five or seven years chiefly in sweeping, in\r\nreceiving an incredible number of thrashings, and in running about town\r\non errands of all sort. I must own that few of them became masters of\r\ntheir respective arts. The tailors and the shoemakers were found only\r\nskilful enough to make clothes or shoes for the servants, and when a\r\nreally good pastry was required for a dinner-party it was ordered at\r\nTremblé’s, while our own confectioner was beating the drum in the music\r\nband.\r\n\r\nThat band was another of my father’s ambitions, and almost every one\r\nof his male servants, in addition to other accomplishments, was a\r\nbass-viol or a clarinet in the band. Makár, the piano-tuner, _alias_\r\nunder-butler, was also a flutist; Andréi, the tailor, played the French\r\nhorn; the confectioner was first put to beat the drum, but he misused\r\nhis instrument to such a deafening degree that a tremendous trumpet was\r\nbought for him, in the hope that his lungs would not have the power to\r\nmake the same noise as his hands; when, however, this last hope had to\r\nbe abandoned, he was sent to be a soldier. As to ‘spotted Tíkhon,’ in\r\naddition to his numerous functions in the household as lamp-cleaner,\r\nfloor-polisher, and footman, he made himself useful in the band--to-day\r\nas a trombone, to-morrow as a bassoon, and occasionally as second\r\nviolin.\r\n\r\nThe two first violins were the only exceptions to the rule: they were\r\n‘violins,’ and nothing else. My father had bought them, with their\r\nlarge families, for a handsome sum of money, from his sisters (he never\r\nbought serfs from nor sold them to strangers). In the evenings when he\r\nwas not at his club, or when there was a dinner or an evening party\r\nat our house, the band of twelve to fifteen musicians was summoned.\r\nThey played very nicely, and were in great demand for dancing-parties\r\nin the neighbourhood; still more when we were in the country. This\r\nwas, of course, a constant source of gratification to my father, whose\r\npermission had to be asked to get the assistance of his band.\r\n\r\nNothing, indeed, gave him more pleasure than to be asked for help,\r\neither in the way mentioned or in any other: for instance, to obtain\r\nfree education for a boy, or to save somebody from a punishment\r\ninflicted upon him by a law court. Although he was liable to fall into\r\nfits of rage, he was undoubtedly possessed of a natural instinct\r\ntoward leniency, and when his patronage was requested he would write\r\nscores of letters in all possible directions, to all sorts of persons\r\nof high standing, in favour of his protégé. At such times, his mail,\r\nwhich was always heavy, would be swollen by half a dozen special\r\nletters, written in a most original, semi-official, and semi-humorous\r\nstyle; each of them sealed, of course, with his arms, in a big square\r\nenvelope, which rattled like a baby rattle on account of the quantity\r\nof sand it contained--the use of blotting-paper being then unknown.\r\nThe more difficult the case, the more energy he would display, until\r\nhe secured the favour he asked for his protégé, whom in many cases he\r\nnever saw.\r\n\r\nMy father liked to have plenty of guests in his house. Our dinner-hour\r\nwas four, and at seven the family gathered round the _samovár_\r\n(tea-urn) for tea. Everyone belonging to our circle could drop in\r\nat that hour, and from the time my sister Hélène was again with us\r\nthere was no lack of visitors, old and young, who took advantage of\r\nthe privilege. When the windows facing the street showed bright light\r\ninside that was enough to let people know that the family was at home\r\nand friends would be welcome.\r\n\r\nNearly every night we had visitors. The green tables were opened in\r\nthe hall for the card-players, while the ladies and the young people\r\nstayed in the reception-room or around Hélène’s piano. When the ladies\r\nhad gone, card-playing continued sometimes till the small hours of\r\nthe morning, and considerable sums of money changed hands among the\r\nplayers. Father invariably lost. But the real danger for him was not\r\nat home: it was at the English Club, where the stakes were much higher\r\nthan in private houses, and especially when he was induced to join\r\na party of ‘very respectable’ gentlemen, in one of the aristocratic\r\nhouses of the Old Equerries’ Quarter, where gambling went on all night.\r\nOn an occasion of this kind his losses were sure to be heavy.\r\n\r\nDancing-parties were not infrequent, to say nothing of a couple of\r\nobligatory balls every winter. Father’s way, in such cases, was to\r\nhave everything done in a good style, whatever the expense. But at the\r\nsame time such niggardliness was practised in our house in daily life\r\nthat if I were to recount it, I should be accused of exaggeration. It\r\nis said of a family of pretenders to the throne of France, renowned\r\nfor their truly regal hunting-parties, that in their everyday life\r\neven the tallow candles are minutely counted. The same sort of miserly\r\neconomy ruled in our house with regard to everything; so much so that\r\nwhen we, the children of the house, grew up, we detested all saving and\r\ncounting. However, in the Old Equerries’ Quarter such a mode of life\r\nonly raised my father in public esteem. ‘The old prince,’ it was said,\r\n‘seems to be sharp over money at home; but he knows how a nobleman\r\nought to live.’\r\n\r\nIn our quiet and clean lanes that was the kind of life which was most\r\nin respect. One of our neighbours, General D----, kept his house up\r\nin very grand style; and yet the most comical scenes took place every\r\nmorning between him and his cook. Breakfast over, the old general,\r\nsmoking his pipe, would himself order the dinner.\r\n\r\n‘Well, my boy,’ he would say to the cook, who appeared in snow-white\r\nattire, ‘to-day we shall not be many: only a couple of guests. You will\r\nmake us a soup, you know, with some spring delicacies--green peas,\r\nFrench beans, and so on. You have not given us any yet, and madam, you\r\nknow, likes a good French spring soup.’\r\n\r\n‘Yes, sir.’\r\n\r\n‘Then, anything you like as an entrée.’\r\n\r\n‘Yes, sir.’\r\n\r\n‘Of course, asparagus is not yet in season, but I saw yesterday such\r\nnice bundles of it in the shops.’\r\n\r\n‘Yes, sir; eight shillings the bundle.’\r\n\r\n‘Quite right! Then, we are sick of your roasted chickens and turkeys;\r\nyou ought to get something for a change.’\r\n\r\n‘Some venison, sir?’\r\n\r\n‘Yes, yes, anything for a change.’\r\n\r\nAnd when the six courses of dinner had been decided on, the old general\r\nwould ask, ‘Now how much shall I give you for to-day’s expenses? Six\r\nshillings will do, I suppose?’\r\n\r\n‘One pound, sir.’\r\n\r\n‘What nonsense, my boy! Here is six shillings; I assure you that’s\r\nquite enough.’\r\n\r\n‘Eight shillings for asparagus, five for the vegetables.’\r\n\r\n‘Now, look here, my dear boy, be reasonable. I’ll go as high as\r\nseven-and-six, and you must be economical.’\r\n\r\nAnd the bargaining would go on thus for half an hour, until the\r\ntwo would agree upon fourteen shillings and sixpence, with the\r\nunderstanding that the morrow’s dinner should not cost more than\r\nthree shillings. Whereupon the general, quite happy at having made\r\nsuch a good bargain, would take his sledge, make a round of the\r\nfashionable shops, and return quite radiant, bringing for his wife a\r\nbottle of exquisite perfume, for which he had paid a fancy price in\r\na French shop, and announcing to his only daughter that a new velvet\r\nmantle--‘something very simple’ and very costly--would be sent for her\r\nto try on that afternoon.\r\n\r\nAll our relatives, who were numerous on my father’s side, lived exactly\r\nin the same way: and if a new spirit occasionally made its appearance,\r\nit usually took the form of some religious passion. Thus a Prince\r\nGagárin joined the Jesuit order, again to the scandal of ‘all Moscow,’\r\nanother young prince entered a monastery, while several older ladies\r\nbecame fanatic devotees.\r\n\r\nThere was a single exception. One of our nearest relatives, Prince--let\r\nme call him Mírski--had spent his youth at St. Petersburg as an officer\r\nof the Guards. He took no interest in keeping his own tailors and\r\ncabinet-makers, for his house was furnished in a grand modern style,\r\nand his wearing apparel was all made in the best St. Petersburg shops.\r\nGambling was not his propensity--he played cards only when in company\r\nwith ladies; but his weak point was his dinner-table, upon which he\r\nspent incredible sums of money.\r\n\r\nLent and Easter were his chief epochs of extravagance. When the Great\r\nLent came, and it would not have been proper to eat meat, cream, or\r\nbutter, he seized the opportunity to invent all sorts of delicacies in\r\nthe way of fish. The best shops of the two capitals were ransacked for\r\nthat purpose; special emissaries were dispatched from his estate to the\r\nmouth of the Vólga, to bring back on post-horses (there was no railway\r\nat that time) a sturgeon of great size or some extraordinarily cured\r\nfish. And when Easter came, there was no end to his inventions.\r\n\r\nEaster, in Russia, is the most venerated and also the gayest of the\r\nyearly festivals. It is the festival of spring. The immense heaps of\r\nsnow which have been lying during the winter along the streets rapidly\r\nthaw, and roaring streams run down the streets; not like a thief\r\nwho creeps in by insensible degrees, but frankly and openly spring\r\ncomes--every day bringing with it a change in the state of the snow and\r\nthe progress of the buds on the trees; the night frosts only keep the\r\nthaw within reasonable bounds. The last week of the Great Lent, Passion\r\nWeek, was kept in Moscow, in my childhood, with extreme solemnity;\r\nit was a time of general mourning, and crowds of people went to the\r\nchurches to listen to the impressive reading of those passages of the\r\nGospels which relate the sufferings of the Christ. Not only were meat,\r\neggs, and butter not eaten, but even fish was refused; some of the most\r\nrigorous taking no food at all on Good Friday. The more striking was\r\nthe contrast when Easter came.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday everyone attended the night service which began in a\r\nmournful way. Then, suddenly, at midnight, the resurrection news was\r\nannounced. All the churches were at once illuminated, and gay peals of\r\nbells resounded from hundreds of bell towers. General rejoicing began.\r\nAll the people kissed one another thrice on the cheeks, repeating the\r\nresurrection words, and the churches, now flooded with light, shone\r\nwith the gay toilettes of the ladies. The poorest woman had a new\r\ndress; if she had only one new dress a year, she would get it for that\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Easter was, and is still, the signal for a real\r\ndebauch in eating. Special Easter cream cheeses (_páskha_) and Easter\r\nbread (_koolích_) are prepared; and everyone, no matter how poor he\r\nor she may be, must have a small páskha and a small koolích, with at\r\nleast one egg painted red, to be consecrated in the church, and to\r\nbe used afterward to break the Lent. With most old Russians, eating\r\nbegan at night, after a short Easter mass, immediately after the\r\nconsecrated food had been brought from church; but in the houses of\r\nthe nobility the ceremony was postponed till Sunday morning, when a\r\ntable was covered with all sorts of viands, cheeses, and pastry, and\r\nall the servants came to exchange with their masters three kisses and a\r\nred-painted egg. Throughout Easter week a table spread with Easter food\r\nstood in the great hall, and every visitor was invited to partake.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion Prince Mírski surpassed himself. Whether he was at\r\nSt. Petersburg or at Moscow, messengers brought to his house, from his\r\nestate, a specially prepared cream cheese for the páskha, and his cook\r\nmanaged to make out of it a piece of artistic confectionery. Other\r\nmessengers were dispatched to the province of Nóvgorod to get a bear’s\r\nham, which was cured for the prince’s Easter table. And while the\r\nprincess, with her two daughters, visited the most austere monasteries,\r\nin which the night service would last three or four hours in\r\nsuccession, and spent all Passion Week in the most mournful condition\r\nof mind, eating only a piece of dry bread between the visits she paid\r\nto Russian, Roman, and Protestant preachers, her husband made every\r\nmorning the tour of the well-known Milútin shops at St. Petersburg,\r\nwhere all possible delicacies are brought from the ends of the earth.\r\nThere he used to select the most extravagant dainties for his Easter\r\ntable. Hundreds of visitors came to his house, and were asked ‘just to\r\ntaste’ this or that extraordinary thing.\r\n\r\nThe end of it was that the prince managed literally to eat up a\r\nconsiderable fortune. His richly furnished house and beautiful estate\r\nwere sold, and when he and his wife were old they had nothing left, not\r\neven a home, and were compelled to live with their children.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that when the emancipation of the serfs came, nearly all\r\nthese families of the Old Equerries’ Quarter were ruined. But I must\r\nnot anticipate events.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nTo maintain such numbers of servants as were kept in our house would\r\nhave been ruinous if all provisions had to be bought at Moscow; but in\r\nthose times of serfdom things were managed very simply. When winter\r\ncame, father sat at his table and wrote the following:--\r\n\r\n‘To the manager of my estate, Nikólskoye, situated in the government\r\nof Kalúga, district of Meschóvsk, on the river Siréna, from the Prince\r\nAlexéi Petróvich Kropótkin, Colonel and Commander of various orders.\r\n\r\n‘On receipt of this, and as soon as winter communication is\r\nestablished, thou art ordered to send to my house, situated in the\r\ncity of Moscow, twenty-five peasant-sledges, drawn by two horses each,\r\none horse from each house, and one sledge and one man from each second\r\nhouse, and to load them with [so many] quarters of oats, [so many] of\r\nwheat, and [so many] of rye, as also with all the poultry and geese\r\nand ducks, well frozen, which have to be killed this winter, well\r\npacked and accompanied by a complete list, under the supervision of a\r\nwell-chosen man;’ and so it went on for a couple of pages, till the\r\nnext full-stop was reached. After this there followed an enumeration of\r\nthe penalties which would be inflicted in case the provisions should\r\nnot reach the house situated in such a street, number so-and-so, in due\r\ntime and in good condition.\r\n\r\nSome time before Christmas the twenty-five peasant-sledges really\r\nentered our gates, and covered the surface of the wide yard.\r\n\r\n‘Frol!’ shouted my father, as soon as the report of this great event\r\nreached him. ‘Kiryúshka! Yegórka! Where are they? Everything will be\r\nstolen! Frol, go and receive the oats! Uliána, go and receive the\r\npoultry! Kiryúshka, call the princess!’\r\n\r\nAll the household was in commotion, the servants running wildly in\r\nevery direction, from the hall to the yard, and from the yard to the\r\nhall, but chiefly to the maid-servants’ room, to communicate there the\r\nNikólskoye news: ‘Pásha is going to marry after Christmas. Aunt Anna\r\nhas surrendered her soul to God,’ and so on. Letters had also come from\r\nthe country, and very soon one of the maids would steal upstairs into\r\nmy room.\r\n\r\n‘Are you alone? The teacher is not in?’\r\n\r\n‘No, he is at the university.’\r\n\r\n‘Well, then, be kind and read me this letter from mother.’\r\n\r\nAnd I would read to her the naïve letter, which always began with the\r\nwords, ‘Father and mother send you their blessing for ages not to be\r\nbroken.’ After this came the news: ‘Aunt Eupraxie lies ill, all her\r\nbones aching; and your cousin is not yet married, but hopes to be after\r\nEaster; and aunt Stepanída’s cow died on All Saints’ day.’ Following\r\nthe news came the greetings, two pages of them: ‘Brother Paul sends you\r\nhis greetings, and the sisters Mary and Dária send their greetings,\r\nand then uncle Dmítri sends his many greetings,’ and so on. However,\r\nnotwithstanding the monotony of the enumeration, each name awakened\r\nsome remarks: ‘Then she is still alive, poor soul, if she sends her\r\ngreetings; it is nine years since she has lain motionless.’ Or, ‘Oh, he\r\nhas not forgotten me; he must be back, then, for Christmas; such a nice\r\nboy. You will write me a letter, won’t you? and I must not forget him\r\nthen.’ I promised, of course, and when the time came I wrote a letter\r\nin exactly the same style.\r\n\r\nWhen the sledges had been unloaded, the hall filled with peasants. They\r\nhad put on their best coats over their sheepskins, and waited until\r\nfather should call them into his room to have a talk about the snow and\r\nthe prospects of the next crops. They hardly dared to walk in their\r\nheavy boots on the polished floor. A few ventured to sit down on the\r\nedge of an oak bench; they emphatically refused to make use of chairs.\r\nSo they waited for hours, looking with alarm upon everyone who entered\r\nfather’s room or issued from it.\r\n\r\nSome time later on, usually next morning, one of the servants would run\r\nslyly upstairs to the class-room.\r\n\r\n‘Are you alone?’\r\n\r\n‘Yes.’\r\n\r\n‘Then go quickly to the hall. The peasants want to see you; something\r\nfrom your nurse.’\r\n\r\nWhen I went down to the hall, one of the peasants would give me\r\na little bundle containing perhaps a few rye cakes, half a dozen\r\nhard-boiled eggs, and some apples, tied in a motley coloured cotton\r\nkerchief. ‘Take that: it is your nurse, Vasilísa, who sends it to you.\r\nLook if the apples are not frozen. I hope not: I kept them all the\r\njourney on my breast. Such a fearful frost we had.’ And the broad,\r\nbearded face, covered with frost-bites, would smile radiantly, showing\r\ntwo rows of beautiful white teeth from beneath quite a forest of hair.\r\n\r\n‘And this is for your brother, from his nurse Anna,’ another peasant\r\nwould say, handing me a similar bundle. ‘“Poor boy,” she says, “he can\r\nnever have enough at school.”’\r\n\r\nBlushing and not knowing what to say, I would murmur at last, ‘Tell\r\nVasilísa that I kiss her, and Anna too, for my brother.’ At which all\r\nfaces would become still more radiant.\r\n\r\n‘Yes, I will, to be sure.’\r\n\r\nThen Kiríla, who kept watch at father’s door, would whisper suddenly,\r\n‘Run quickly upstairs; your father may come out in a moment. Don’t\r\nforget the kerchief; they want to take it back.’\r\n\r\nAs I carefully folded the worn kerchief, I most passionately desired to\r\nsend Vasilísa something. But I had nothing to send, not even a toy, and\r\nwe never had pocket-money.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur best time, of course, was in the country. As soon as Easter\r\nand Whitsuntide had passed, all our thoughts were directed towards\r\nNikólskoye. However, time went on--the lilacs must be past blooming at\r\nNikólskoye--and father had still thousands of affairs to keep him in\r\ntown. At last, five or six peasant-carts entered our yard: they came\r\nto take all sorts of things which had to be sent to the country house.\r\nThe great old coach and the other coaches in which we were going to\r\nmake the journey were taken out and inspected once more. The boxes\r\nbegan to be packed. Our lessons made slow progress; at every moment we\r\ninterrupted our teachers, asking whether this or that book should be\r\ntaken with us, and long before all others we began packing our books,\r\nour slates, and our toys, which were of our own making.\r\n\r\nEverything was ready: the peasant-carts stood heavily loaded with\r\nfurniture for the country house, boxes containing the kitchen utensils,\r\nand almost countless empty glass jars which were to be brought back in\r\nthe autumn filled with all kinds of preserves. The peasants waited\r\nevery morning for hours in the hall; but the order for leaving did\r\nnot come. Father continued to write all the morning in his room, and\r\ndisappeared at night. Finally, our stepmother interfered, her maid\r\nhaving ventured to report that the peasants were very anxious to\r\nreturn, as haymaking was near.\r\n\r\nNext afternoon, Frol, the major-domo, and Mikhael Aléeff, the first\r\nviolin, were called into father’s room. A sack containing the ‘food\r\nmoney’--that is, a few coppers a day--for each of the forty or fifty\r\nsouls who were to accompany the household to Nikólskoye, was handed\r\nto Frol, with a list. All were enumerated in that list: the band\r\nin full; then the cooks and the under-cooks, the laundresses, the\r\nunder-laundress, who was blessed with a family of six mites, ‘Polka\r\nSquinting,’ ‘Domna the Big One,’ ‘Domna the Small One,’ and the rest of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe first violin received an ‘order of march.’ I knew it well, because\r\nfather, seeing that he never would be ready, had called me to copy it\r\ninto the book, in which he used to copy all ‘outgoing papers’:--\r\n\r\n‘To my house servant, Mikhael Aléeff, from Prince Alexéi Petróvich\r\nKropótkin, Colonel and Commander.\r\n\r\n‘Thou art ordered, on May 29, at six A.M., to march out with my loads,\r\nfrom the city of Moscow, for my estate, situated in the government\r\nof Kalúga, district of Meschóvsk, on the river Siréna, representing\r\na distance of one hundred and sixty miles from this house; to look\r\nafter the good conduct of the men entrusted to thee, and if any one\r\nof them proves to be guilty of misconduct, or of drunkenness, or of\r\ninsubordination, to bring the said man before the commander of the\r\ngarrison detachment of the separate corps of the interior garrisons,\r\nwith the inclosed circular letter, and to ask that he may be punished\r\nby flogging [the first violin knew who was meant], as an example to the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n‘Thou art ordered, moreover, to look especially after the integrity\r\nof the goods entrusted to thy care, and to march according to the\r\nfollowing order: First day, stay at village So-and-So, to feed the\r\nhorses; second day, spend the night at the town of Podólsk;’ and so on\r\nfor all the seven or eight days that the journey would last.\r\n\r\nNext day, at ten instead of at six--punctuality is not a Russian\r\nvirtue (‘Thank God, we are not Germans,’ true Russians used to say),\r\nthe carts left the house. The servants had to make the journey on\r\nfoot; only the children were accommodated with a seat in a bath-tub\r\nor basket, on the top of a loaded cart, and some of the women might\r\nfind an occasional resting-place on the ledge of a cart. The others\r\nhad to walk all the hundred and sixty miles. As long as they were\r\nmarching through Moscow, discipline was maintained: it was peremptorily\r\nforbidden to wear top-boots or to pass a belt over the coat. But when\r\nthey were on the road, and we overtook them a couple of days later, and\r\nespecially when it was known that father would stay a few days longer\r\nat Moscow, the men and the women--dressed in all sorts of impossible\r\ncoats, belted with cotton handkerchiefs, burned by the sun or dripping\r\nunder the rain, and helping themselves along with sticks cut in the\r\nwoods--certainly looked more like a wandering band of gypsies than the\r\nhousehold of a wealthy landowner. Similar peregrinations were made by\r\nevery household in those times, and when we saw a file of servants\r\nmarching along one of our streets, we at once knew that the Apúkhtins\r\nor the Pryánishnikoffs were migrating.\r\n\r\nThe carts were gone, yet the family did not move. All of us were sick\r\nof waiting; but father still continued to write interminable orders to\r\nthe managers of his estates, and I copied them diligently into the big\r\n‘outgoing book.’ At last the order to start was given. We were called\r\ndownstairs. My father read aloud the order of march, addressed to ‘the\r\nPrincess Kropótkin, wife of Prince Alexéi Petróvich Kropótkin, Colonel\r\nand Commander,’ in which the halting-places during the five days’\r\njourney were duly enumerated. True, the order was written for May 30,\r\nand the departure was fixed for nine A.M., though May was gone, and the\r\ndeparture took place in the afternoon: this upset all calculations.\r\nBut, as is usual in military marching-orders, this circumstance had\r\nbeen foreseen, and was provided for in the following paragraph:--\r\n\r\n‘If, however, contrary to expectation, the departure of your highness\r\ndoes not take place at the said day and hour, you are requested to act\r\naccording to the best of your understanding, in order to bring the said\r\njourney to its best issue.’\r\n\r\nThen, all present, the family and the servants, sat down for a moment,\r\nsigned themselves with the cross, and bade my father good-bye. ‘I\r\nentreat you, Alexis, don’t go to the club,’ our stepmother whispered to\r\nhim. The great coach, drawn by four horses, with a postillion, stood\r\nat the door, with its little folding ladder to facilitate climbing in;\r\nthe other coaches also were there. Our seats were enumerated in the\r\nmarching-orders, but our stepmother had to exercise ‘the best of her\r\nunderstanding’ even at that early stage of the proceedings, and we\r\nstarted to the great satisfaction of all.\r\n\r\nThe journey was an inexhaustible source of enjoyment for us children.\r\nThe stages were short, and we stopped twice a day to feed the horses.\r\nAs the ladies screamed at the slightest declivity of the road, it was\r\nfound more convenient to alight each time the road went up or down\r\nhill, which it did continually, and we took advantage of this to have a\r\npeep into the woods by the roadside, or a run along some crystal brook.\r\nThe beautifully kept high road from Moscow to Warsaw, which we followed\r\nfor some distance, was covered, moreover, with a variety of interesting\r\nobjects: files of loaded carts, groups of pilgrims, and all sorts of\r\npeople. Twice a day we stopped in large, animated villages, and after\r\na good deal of bargaining about the prices to be charged for hay and\r\noats, as well as for the samovárs, we dismounted at the gates of an\r\ninn. Cook Andréi bought a chicken and made the soup, while we ran in\r\nthe meantime to the next wood, or examined the farmyard, the gardens,\r\nthe inner life of the inn.\r\n\r\nAt Máloyaroslávetz, where a battle was fought in 1812, when the Russian\r\narmy vainly attempted to stop Napoleon in his retreat from Moscow,\r\nwe usually spent the night. M. Poulain, who had been wounded in the\r\nSpanish campaign, knew, or pretended to know, everything about the\r\nbattle at Máloyaroslávetz. He took us to the battlefield, and explained\r\nhow the Russians tried to check Napoleon’s advance, and how the Grande\r\nArmée crushed them and made its way through the Russian lines. He\r\nexplained it as well as if he himself had taken part in the battle.\r\nHere the Cossacks attempted _un mouvement tournant_, but Davout, or\r\nsome other marshal, routed them and pursued them just beyond these\r\nhills on the right. There the left wing of Napoleon crushed the Russian\r\ninfantry, and here Napoleon himself, at the head of the Old Guard,\r\ncharged Kutúzoff’s centre, and covered himself and his Guard with\r\nundying glory.\r\n\r\nWe once took the old Kalúga route, and stopped at Tarútino; but here M.\r\nPoulain was much less eloquent. For it was at this place that Napoleon,\r\nwho intended to retreat by a southern route, was compelled, after a\r\nbloody battle, to abandon his plan, and was forced to take the Smolénsk\r\nroute, which his army had laid waste during its march on Moscow.\r\nHowever, in M. Poulain’s narrative, Napoleon did not lose the battle:\r\nhe was only deceived by his marshals; otherwise he would have marched\r\nstraight upon Kíeff and Odéssa, and his eagles would have floated over\r\nthe Black Sea.\r\n\r\nBeyond Kalúga we had to cross for a stretch of five miles a beautiful\r\npine forest, which remains connected in my memory with some of the\r\nhappiest reminiscences of my childhood. The sand in that forest was as\r\ndeep as in an African desert, and we went all the way on foot, while\r\nthe horses, stopping every moment, slowly dragged the carriages in the\r\nsand. When I was in my teens, it was my delight to leave the family\r\nbehind, and to walk the whole distance by myself. Immense red pines,\r\ncenturies old, rose on every side, and not a sound reached the ear\r\nexcept the voices of the lofty trees. In a small ravine a fresh crystal\r\nspring murmured, and a passer-by had left in it, for the use of those\r\nwho should come after him, a small funnel-shaped ladle, made of birch\r\nbark, with a split stick for a handle. Noiselessly a squirrel ran up a\r\ntree, and the underwood was as full of mysteries as were the trees. In\r\nthat forest my first love of Nature and my first dim perception of its\r\nincessant life were born.\r\n\r\nBeyond the forest, and past the ferry which took us over the Ugrá, we\r\nleft the high road and entered narrow country lanes, where green ears\r\nof rye bent toward the coach, and the horses managed to bite mouthfuls\r\nof grass on either side of the way, as they ran, closely pressed to\r\none another in the narrow, trenchlike road. At last we saw the willows\r\nwhich marked the approach to our village, and suddenly we caught sight\r\nof the elegant, pale-yellow bell tower of the Nikólskoye church.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor the quiet life of the landlords of those times Nikólskoye was\r\nadmirably suited. There was nothing in it of the luxury which is seen\r\nin richer estates; but an artistic hand was visible in the planning of\r\nthe buildings and gardens, and in the general arrangement of things.\r\nBesides the main house, which father had recently built, there were,\r\nround a spacious and well-kept yard, several smaller houses, which\r\ngave a greater degree of independence to their inhabitants, without\r\ndestroying the close intercourse of the family life. An immense\r\n‘upper garden’ was devoted to fruit-trees, and through it the church\r\nwas reached. The southern slope of the land, which led to the river,\r\nwas entirely given up to a pleasure garden, where flower-beds were\r\nintermingled with alleys of lime-trees, lilacs, and acacias. From the\r\nbalcony of the main house there was a beautiful view of the Siréna,\r\nwith the ruins of an old earthen fortress where the Russians had\r\noffered a stubborn resistance during the Mongol invasion, and farther\r\non, the boundless yellow grain-fields, with copses of woods on the\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\nIn the early years of my childhood we occupied with M. Poulain one of\r\nthe separate houses entirely by ourselves; and after his method of\r\neducation was softened by the intervention of our sister Hélène, we\r\nwere on the best possible terms with him. Father was invariably absent\r\nfrom home in the summer, which he spent in military inspections, and\r\nour stepmother did not pay much attention to us, especially after her\r\nown child, Pauline, was born. We were thus always with M. Poulain, who\r\nthoroughly enjoyed the stay in the country, and let us enjoy it. The\r\nwoods; the walks along the river; the climbing over the hills to the\r\nold fortress, which M. Poulain made alive for us as he told how it\r\nwas defended by the Russians, and how it was captured by the Tartars;\r\nthe little adventures, in one of which he became our hero by saving\r\nAlexander from drowning; an occasional encounter with wolves--there\r\nwas no end of new and delightful impressions. Large parties were\r\nalso organized in which all the family took part, sometimes picking\r\nmushrooms in the woods, and afterward having tea in the midst of the\r\nforest, where a man a hundred years old lived alone with his little\r\ngrandson, taking care of the bees. At other times we went to one of\r\nfather’s villages where a big pond had been dug, in which golden carp\r\nwere caught by the thousand--part of them being taken for the landlord\r\nand the remainder being distributed among all the peasants. My former\r\nnurse, Vasilísa, lived in that village. Her family was one of the\r\npoorest; besides her husband, she had only a small boy to help her, and\r\na girl, my foster-sister, who became later on a preacher and a ‘Virgin’\r\nin the Nonconformist sect to which they belonged. There was no bound to\r\nher joy when I came to see her. Cream, eggs, apples, and honey were all\r\nthat she could offer; but the way in which she offered them, in bright\r\nwooden plates, after having covered the table with a fine snow-white\r\nlinen tablecloth of her own making (with the Russian Nonconformists\r\nabsolute cleanliness is a matter of religion), and the fond words with\r\nwhich she addressed me, treating me as her own son, left the warmest\r\nfeelings in my heart. I must say the same of the nurses of my elder\r\nbrothers, Nicholas and Alexander, who belonged to prominent families of\r\ntwo other Nonconformist sects in Nikólskoye. Few know what treasuries\r\nof goodness can be found in the hearts of Russian peasants, even\r\nafter centuries of the most cruel oppression, which might well have\r\nembittered them.\r\n\r\nOn stormy days M. Poulain had an abundance of tales to tell us,\r\nespecially about the campaign in Spain. Over and over again we induced\r\nhim to tell us how he was wounded in a battle, and every time he came\r\nto the point when he felt warm blood streaming into his boot, we jumped\r\nto kiss him and gave him all sorts of pet names.\r\n\r\nEverything seemed to prepare us for the military career: the\r\npredilection of our father (the only toys that I remember his having\r\nbought for us were a rifle and a real sentry-box); the war tales of\r\nM. Poulain; nay, even the library which we had at our disposal. This\r\nlibrary, which had once belonged to General Repnínsky, our mother’s\r\ngrandfather, a learned military man of the eighteenth century,\r\nconsisted exclusively of books on military warfare, adorned with rich\r\nplates and beautifully bound in leather. It was our chief recreation,\r\non wet days, to look over the plates of these books, representing the\r\nweapons of warfare since the times of the Hebrews, and giving plans\r\nof all the battles that had been fought since Alexander of Macedonia.\r\nThese heavy books also offered excellent materials for building out of\r\nthem strong fortresses which would stand for some time the blows of a\r\nbattering-ram and the projectiles of an Archimedean catapult (which,\r\nhowever, persisted in sending stones into the windows, and was soon\r\nprohibited). Yet neither Alexander nor I became military men. The\r\nliterature of the sixties wiped out the teachings of our childhood.\r\n\r\nM. Poulain’s opinions about revolutions were those of the Orleanist\r\n‘Illustration Française,’ of which he received back numbers, and of\r\nwhich we knew all the woodcuts. For a long time I could not imagine a\r\nrevolution otherwise than in the shape of Death riding on a horse, the\r\nred flag on one hand and a scythe in the other, mowing down men right\r\nand left. So it was pictured in the ‘Illustration.’ But I now think\r\nthat M. Poulain’s dislike was limited to the uprising of 1848, for one\r\nof his tales about the Revolution of 1789 deeply impressed my mind.\r\n\r\nThe title of prince was used in our house with and without occasion. M.\r\nPoulain must have been shocked by it, for he began once to tell us what\r\nhe knew of the great Revolution, I cannot now recall what he said, but\r\none thing I remember, namely, that ‘Count Mirabeau’ and other nobles\r\none day renounced their titles, and that Count Mirabeau, to show his\r\ncontempt for aristocratic pretensions, opened a shop decorated with\r\na signboard which bore the inscription, ‘Mirabeau, tailor.’ (I tell\r\nthe story as I had it from M. Poulain.) For a long time after that I\r\nworried myself thinking what trade I should take up, so as to write,\r\n‘Kropótkin, such and such a handicraft man.’ Later on, my Russian\r\nteacher, Nikolái Pávlovich Smirnóff, and the general Republican tone\r\nof Russian literature influenced me in the same way; and when I began\r\nto write novels--that is, in my twelfth year--I adopted the signature\r\nP. Kropótkin, which I never have departed from, notwithstanding the\r\nremonstrances of my chiefs when I was in the military service.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1852 my brother Alexander was sent to the corps of\r\ncadets, and from that time we saw each other only during the holidays\r\nand occasionally on Sundays. The corps of cadets was six miles from our\r\nhouse, and although we had a dozen horses, it always happened that when\r\nthe time came to send the sledge to the corps there was no horse free\r\nfor that purpose. My eldest brother, Nicholas, came home very seldom.\r\nThe relative freedom which Alexander found at school, and especially\r\nthe influence of two of his teachers in literature, developed his\r\nintellect rapidly, and later on I shall have ample occasion to speak of\r\nthe beneficial influence that he exercised upon my own development. It\r\nis a great privilege to have had a loving, intelligent elder brother.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime I remained at home. I had to wait till my turn to enter\r\nthe corps of pages should come, and that did not happen until I was\r\nnearly fifteen years of age. M. Poulain was dismissed, and a German\r\ntutor was engaged instead. He was one of those idealistic men who are\r\nnot uncommon among Germans, but I remember him chiefly on account of\r\nthe enthusiastic way in which he used to recite Schiller’s poetry,\r\naccompanying it by a most naïve kind of acting that delighted me. He\r\nstayed with us only one winter.\r\n\r\nThe next winter I was sent to attend the classes at a Moscow gymnasium;\r\nand finally I remained with our Russian teacher, Smirnóff. We soon\r\nbecame friends, especially after my father took both of us for a\r\njourney to his Ryazán estate. During this journey we indulged in all\r\nsorts of fun, and we used to invent humorous stories in connection\r\nwith the men and the things that we saw; while the impression produced\r\nupon me by the hilly tracts we crossed added some new and fine touches\r\nto my growing love of nature. Under the impulse given me by Smirnóff,\r\nmy literary tastes also began to grow, and during the years from 1854\r\nto 1857 I had full opportunity to develop them. My teacher, who had\r\nby this time finished his studies at the university, obtained a small\r\nclerkship in a law court, and spent his mornings there. I was thus\r\nleft to myself till dinner-time, and after having prepared my lessons\r\nand taken a walk, I had plenty of leisure for reading and writing. In\r\nthe autumn, when my teacher returned to his office at Moscow, while\r\nwe remained in the country, I was left again to myself, and though in\r\ncontinual intercourse with the family, and spending part of the day in\r\nplaying with my little sister Pauline, I could in fact dispose of my\r\ntime as I liked.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSerfdom was then in the last years of its existence. It is recent\r\nhistory--it seems to be only of yesterday; and yet, even in Russia, few\r\nrealize what serfdom was in reality. There is a dim conception that the\r\nconditions which it created were very bad; but how these conditions\r\naffected human beings bodily and mentally is only vaguely understood.\r\nIt is amazing, indeed, to see how quickly an institution and its social\r\nconsequences are forgotten when the institution has ceased to exist,\r\nand with what rapidity men and things change after that. I will try to\r\nrecall the conditions of serfdom by telling, not what I heard, but what\r\nI saw.\r\n\r\nUliána, the housekeeper, stands in the passage leading to father’s\r\nroom, and crosses herself; she dares neither to advance nor to retreat.\r\nAt last, after having recited a prayer, she enters the room, and\r\nreports, in a hardly audible voice, that the store of tea is nearly at\r\nan end, that there are only twenty pounds of sugar left, and that the\r\nother provisions will soon be exhausted.\r\n\r\n‘Thieves, robbers!’ shouts my father. ‘And you, you are in league with\r\nthem!’ His voice thunders throughout the house. Our stepmother leaves\r\nUliána to face the storm. But father cries, ‘Frol, call the princess!\r\nWhere is she?’ And when she enters, he receives her with the same\r\nreproaches.\r\n\r\n‘You also are in league with this progeny of Ham; you are standing up\r\nfor them;’ and so on, for half an hour or more.\r\n\r\nThen he commences to verify the accounts. At the same time, he thinks\r\nabout the hay. Frol is sent to weigh what is left of that, and our\r\nstepmother is sent to be present during the weighing, while father\r\ncalculates how much of it ought to be in the barn. A considerable\r\nquantity of hay appears to be missing, and Uliána cannot account for\r\nseveral pounds of such and such provisions. Father’s voice becomes more\r\nand more menacing; Uliána is trembling; but it is the coachman who now\r\nenters the room, and is stormed at by his master. Father springs at\r\nhim, strikes him, but he keeps repeating, ‘Your highness must have made\r\na mistake.’\r\n\r\nFather repeats his calculations, and this time it appears that there is\r\nmore hay in the barn than there ought to be. The shouting continues;\r\nhe now reproaches the coachman with not having given the horses their\r\ndaily rations in full; but the coachman calls on all the saints to\r\nwitness that he gave the animals their due, and Frol invokes the Virgin\r\nto confirm the coachman’s appeal.\r\n\r\nBut father will not be appeased. He calls in Makár, the piano-tuner\r\nand sub-butler, and reminds him of all his recent sins. He was drunk\r\nlast week, and must have been drunk yesterday, for he broke half a\r\ndozen plates. In fact, the breaking of these plates was the real\r\ncause of all the disturbance: our stepmother had reported the fact to\r\nfather in the morning, and that was why Uliána was received with more\r\nscolding than was usually the case, why the verification of the hay was\r\nundertaken, and why father now continues to shout that ‘this progeny of\r\nHam’ deserve all the punishments on earth.\r\n\r\nOf a sudden there is a lull in the storm. My father takes his seat at\r\nthe table and writes a note. ‘Take Makár with this note to the police\r\nstation, and let a hundred lashes with the birch rod be given to him.’\r\n\r\nTerror and absolute muteness reign in the house.\r\n\r\nThe clock strikes four, and we all go down to dinner; but no one has\r\nany appetite, and the soup remains in the plates untouched. We are\r\nten at table, and behind each of us a violinist or a trombone-player\r\nstands, with a clean plate in his left hand; but Makár is not among\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n‘Where is Makár?’ our stepmother asks. ‘Call him in.’\r\n\r\nMakár does not appear, and the order is repeated. He enters at last,\r\npale, with a distorted face, ashamed, his eyes cast down. Father looks\r\ninto his plate, while our stepmother, seeing that no one has touched\r\nthe soup, tries to encourage us.\r\n\r\n‘Don’t you find, children,’ she says, ‘that the soup is delicious?’\r\n\r\nTears suffocate me, and immediately after dinner is over I run out,\r\ncatch Makár in a dark passage and try to kiss his hand; but he tears it\r\naway, and says, either as a reproach or as a question, ‘Let me alone;\r\nyou, too, when you are grown up, will you not be just the same?’\r\n\r\n‘No, no, never!’\r\n\r\nYet father was not among the worst of landowners. On the contrary, the\r\nservants and the peasants considered him one of the best. What we saw\r\nin our house was going on everywhere, often in much more cruel forms.\r\nThe flogging of the serfs was a regular part of the duties of the\r\npolice and of the fire brigade.\r\n\r\nA landowner once made the remark to another, ‘Why is it, general,\r\nthat the number of the souls on your estate increases so slowly? You\r\nprobably do not look after their marriages.’\r\n\r\nA few days later the general ordered that a list of all the inhabitants\r\nof his village should be brought him. He picked out from it the names\r\nof the boys who had attained the age of eighteen, and of the girls just\r\npast sixteen--these are the legal ages for marriage in Russia. Then he\r\nwrote, ‘John to marry Anna, Paul to marry Paráshka,’ and so on with\r\nfive couples. The five weddings, he added, must take place in ten days,\r\nthe next Sunday but one.\r\n\r\nA general cry of despair rose from the village. Women, young and old,\r\nwept in every house. Anna had hoped to marry Gregory; Paul’s parents\r\nhad already had a talk with the Fedótoffs about their girl, who would\r\nsoon be of age. Moreover, it was the season for ploughing, not for\r\nweddings; and what wedding can be prepared in ten days? Dozens of\r\npeasants came to see the landowner; peasant women stood in groups at\r\nthe back entrance of the mansion, with pieces of fine linen for the\r\nlandowner’s spouse, to secure her intervention. All in vain. The master\r\nhad said that the wedding should take place at such a date, and so it\r\nmust be.\r\n\r\nAt the appointed time, the nuptial processions, in this case more like\r\nburial processions, went to the church. The women cried with loud\r\nvoices, as they are wont to cry during burials. One of the house valets\r\nwas sent to the church, to report to the master as soon as the wedding\r\nceremonies were over; but soon he came running back, cap in hand, pale\r\nand distressed.\r\n\r\n‘Paráshka,’ he said, ‘makes a stand; she refuses to be married to Paul.\r\nFather’ (that is, the priest) ‘asked her, “Do you agree?” but she\r\nreplied in a loud voice, “No, I don’t.”’\r\n\r\nThe landowner grew furious. ‘Go and tell that long-maned drunkard’\r\n(meaning the priest; the Russian clergy wear their hair long) ‘that if\r\nParáshka is not married at once, I will report him as a drunkard to the\r\narchbishop. How dares he, clerical dirt, disobey me? Tell him he shall\r\nbe sent to rot in a monastery, and I shall exile Paráshka’s family to\r\nthe steppes.’\r\n\r\nThe valet transmitted the message. Paráshka’s relatives and the priest\r\nsurrounded the girl; her mother weeping, fell on her knees before her,\r\nentreating her not to ruin the whole family. The girl continued to say\r\n‘I won’t,’ but in a weaker and weaker voice, then in a whisper, until\r\nat last she stood silent. The nuptial crown was put on her head; she\r\nmade no resistance, and the valet ran full speed to the mansion to\r\nannounce, ‘They are married.’\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later, the small bells of the nuptial processions\r\nresounded at the gate of the mansion. The five couples alighted from\r\nthe cars, crossed the yard and entered the hall. The landlord received\r\nthem, offering them glasses of wine, while the parents, standing behind\r\nthe crying daughters, ordered them to bow to the earth before their\r\nlord.\r\n\r\nMarriages by order were so common that amongst our servants, each time\r\na young couple foresaw that they might be ordered to marry, although\r\nthey had no mutual inclination for each other, they took the precaution\r\nof standing together as godfather and godmother at the christening\r\nof a child in one of the peasant families. This rendered marriage\r\nimpossible, according to Russian Church law. The stratagem was usually\r\nsuccessful, but once it ended in a tragedy. Andréi, the tailor, fell\r\nin love with a girl belonging to one of our neighbours. He hoped that\r\nmy father would permit him to go free, as a tailor, in exchange for\r\na certain yearly payment, and that by working hard at his trade he\r\ncould manage to lay aside some money and to buy freedom for the girl.\r\nOtherwise, in marrying one of my father’s serfs she would have become\r\nthe serf of her husband’s master. However, as Andréi and one of the\r\nmaids of our household foresaw that they might be ordered to marry,\r\nthey agreed to unite as god-parents in the christening of a child. What\r\nthey had feared happened: one day they were called to the master, and\r\nthe dreaded order was given.\r\n\r\n‘We are always obedient to your will,’ they replied, ‘but a few weeks\r\nago we acted as godfather and godmother at a christening.’ Andréi also\r\nexplained his wishes and intentions. The result was that he was sent to\r\nthe recruiting board to become a soldier.\r\n\r\nUnder Nicholas I. there was no obligatory military service for all,\r\nsuch as now exists. Nobles and merchants were exempt, and when a new\r\nlevy of recruits was ordered, the landowners had to supply a certain\r\nnumber of men from their serfs. As a rule, the peasants, within their\r\nvillage communities, kept a roll amongst themselves; but the house\r\nservants were entirely at the mercy of their lord, and if he was\r\ndissatisfied with one of them, he sent him to the recruiting board and\r\ntook recruit acquittance, which had a considerable money value, as it\r\ncould be sold to any one whose turn it was to become a soldier.\r\n\r\nMilitary service in those times was terrible. A man was required to\r\nserve twenty-five years under the colours, and the life of a soldier\r\nwas hard in the extreme. To become a soldier meant to be torn away\r\nfor ever from one’s native village and surroundings, and to be at\r\nthe mercy of officers like Timoféeff, whom I have already mentioned.\r\nBlows from the officers, flogging with birch rods and with sticks,\r\nfor the slightest fault, were normal affairs. The cruelty that was\r\ndisplayed surpasses all imagination. Even in the corps of cadets, where\r\nonly noblemen’s sons were educated, a thousand blows with birch rods\r\nwere sometimes administered, in the presence of all the corps, for a\r\ncigarette--the doctor standing by the tortured boy, and ordering the\r\npunishment to end only when he ascertained that the pulse was about to\r\nstop beating. The bleeding victim was carried away unconscious to the\r\nhospital. The Grand Duke Mikhael, commander of the military schools,\r\nwould quickly have removed the director of a corps in which one or two\r\nsuch cases did not occur every year. ‘No discipline,’ he would have\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nWith common soldiers it was far worse. When one of them appeared\r\nbefore a court-martial, the sentence was that a thousand men should\r\nbe placed in two ranks facing each other, every soldier armed with a\r\nstick of the thickness of the little finger (these sticks were known\r\nunder their German name of _Spitzruthen_), and that the condemned man\r\nshould be dragged three, four, five, and seven times between these two\r\nrows, each soldier administering a blow. Sergeants followed to see that\r\nfull force was used. After one or two thousand blows had been given,\r\nthe victim, spitting blood, was taken to the hospital and attended\r\nto, in order that the punishment might be finished as soon as he had\r\nmore or less recovered from the effects of the first part of it. If he\r\ndied under the torture, the execution of the sentence was completed\r\nupon the corpse. Nicholas I. and his brother Mikhael were pitiless;\r\nno remittance of the punishment was ever possible. ‘I will send you\r\nthrough the ranks; you shall be skinned under the sticks,’ were threats\r\nwhich made part of the current language.\r\n\r\nA gloomy terror used to spread through our house when it became known\r\nthat one of the servants was to be sent to the recruiting board.\r\nThe man was chained and placed under guard in the office to prevent\r\nsuicide. A peasant cart was brought to the office door, and the doomed\r\nman was taken out between two watchmen. All the servants surrounded\r\nhim. He made a deep bow asking everyone to pardon him his willing or\r\nunwilling offences. If his father and mother lived in our village,\r\nthey came to see him off. He bowed to the ground before them, and his\r\nmother and his other female relatives began loudly to sing out their\r\nlamentations--a sort of half-song and half-recitative: ‘To whom do you\r\nabandon us? Who will take care of you in the strange lands? Who will\r\nprotect me from cruel men?’--exactly in the same way in which they sang\r\ntheir lamentations at a burial, and with the same words.\r\n\r\nThus Andréi had now to face for twenty-five years the terrible fate of\r\na soldier: all his schemes of happiness had come to a violent end.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe fate of one of the maids, Pauline, or Pólya, as she used to be\r\ncalled, was even more tragical. She had been apprenticed to make fine\r\nembroidery, and was an artist at the work. At Nikólskoye her embroidery\r\nframe stood in sister Hélène’s room, and she often took part in the\r\nconversations that went on between our sister and a sister of our\r\nstepmother who stayed with Hélène. Altogether, by her behaviour and\r\ntalk Pólya was more like an educated young person than a housemaid.\r\n\r\nA misfortune befell her: she realized that she would soon be a mother.\r\nShe told all to our stepmother, who burst into reproaches: ‘I will not\r\nhave that creature in my house any longer! I will not permit such a\r\nshame in my house! oh, the shameless creature!’ and so on. The tears\r\nof Hélène made no difference. Pólya had her hair cut short, and was\r\nexiled to the dairy; but as she was just embroidering an extraordinary\r\nskirt, she had to finish it at the dairy, in a dirty cottage, at\r\na microscopical window. She finished it, and made many more fine\r\nembroideries, all in the hope of obtaining her pardon. But pardon did\r\nnot come.\r\n\r\nThe father of her child, a servant of one of our neighbours, implored\r\npermission to marry her; but as he had no money to offer, his request\r\nwas refused. Pólya’s ‘too gentlewoman-like manners’ were taken as an\r\noffence, and a most bitter fate was kept in reserve for her. There was\r\nin our household a man employed as a postillion, on account of his\r\nsmall size; he went under the name of ‘bandy-legged Fílka.’ In his\r\nboyhood a horse had kicked him terribly, and he did not grow. His\r\nlegs were crooked, his feet were turned inward, his nose was broken\r\nand turned to one side, his jaw was deformed. To this monster it was\r\ndecided to marry Pólya--and she was married by force. The couple were\r\nsent to become peasants at my father’s estate in Ryazán.\r\n\r\nHuman feelings were not recognized, not even suspected, in serfs, and\r\nwhen Turguéneff published his little story ‘Mumú,’ and Grigoróvich\r\nbegan to issue his thrilling novels, in which he made his readers weep\r\nover the misfortunes of the serfs, it was to a great number of persons\r\na startling revelation. ‘They love just as we do; is it possible?’\r\nexclaimed the sentimental ladies who could not read a French novel\r\nwithout shedding tears over the troubles of the noble heroes and\r\nheroines.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe education which the owners occasionally gave to some of their serfs\r\nwas only another source of misfortune for the latter. My father once\r\npicked out in a peasant house a clever boy, and sent him to be educated\r\nas a doctor’s assistant. The boy was diligent, and after a few years’\r\napprenticeship made a decided success. When he returned home, my father\r\nbought all that was required for a well-equipped dispensary, which\r\nwas arranged very nicely in one of the side houses of Nikólskoye. In\r\nsummer time Sásha the Doctor--that was the familiar name under which\r\nthis young man went in the household--was busy gathering and preparing\r\nall sorts of medical herbs, and in a short time he became most popular\r\nin the region round Nikólskoye. The sick people among the peasants\r\ncame from the neighbouring villages, and my father was proud of the\r\nsuccess of his dispensary. But this condition of things did not last.\r\nOne winter, my father came to Nikólskoye, stayed there for a few days,\r\nand left. That night Sásha the Doctor shot himself--by accident, it was\r\nreported; but there was a love story at the bottom of it. He was in\r\nlove with a girl whom he could not marry, as she belonged to another\r\nlandowner.\r\n\r\nThe case of another young man, Gherásim Kruglóff, whom my father\r\neducated at the Moscow Agricultural Institute, was almost equally sad.\r\nHe passed his examinations most brilliantly, getting a gold medal, and\r\nthe director of the Institute made all possible endeavours to induce my\r\nfather to give him freedom and to let him go to the university--serfs\r\nnot being allowed to enter there. ‘He is sure to become a remarkable\r\nman,’ the director said, ‘perhaps one of the glories of Russia, and it\r\nwill be an honour for you to have recognized his capacities and to have\r\ngiven such a man to Russian science.’\r\n\r\n‘I need him for my own estate,’ my father replied to the many\r\napplications made on the young man’s behalf. In reality, with the\r\nprimitive methods of agriculture which were then in use, and from which\r\nmy father would never have departed, Gherásim Kruglóff was absolutely\r\nuseless. He made a survey of the estate, but when that was done he\r\nwas ordered to sit in the servants’ room and to stand with a plate\r\nat dinner-time. Of course Gherásim resented it very much; his dreams\r\ncarried him to the university, to scientific work. His looks betrayed\r\nhis discontent, and our stepmother seemed to find an especial pleasure\r\nin offending him at every opportunity. One day in the autumn, a rush of\r\nwind having opened the entrance gate, she called out to him, ‘Garáska,\r\ngo and shut the gate.’\r\n\r\nThat was the last drop. He answered, ‘You have a porter for that,’ and\r\nwent his way.\r\n\r\nMy stepmother ran into father’s room, crying, ‘Your servants insult me\r\nin your house!’\r\n\r\nImmediately Gherásim was put under arrest, and chained, to be sent away\r\nas a soldier. The parting of his old father and mother with him was one\r\nof the most heartrending scenes I ever saw.\r\n\r\nThis time, however, fate took its revenge. Nicholas I. died, and\r\nmilitary service became more tolerable. Gherásim’s great ability was\r\nsoon remarked, and in a few years he was one of the chief clerks,\r\nand the real working force in one of the departments of the Ministry\r\nof War. Meanwhile, my father, who was absolutely honest, and, at a\r\ntime when almost every one was receiving bribes and making fortunes,\r\nhad never let himself be bribed, departed once from the strict rules\r\nof the service in order to oblige the commander of the corps to which\r\nhe belonged, and consented to allow an irregularity of some kind. It\r\nnearly cost him his promotion to the rank of general; the only object\r\nof his thirty-five years’ service in the army seemed on the point\r\nof being lost. My stepmother went to St. Petersburg to remove the\r\ndifficulty, and one day, after many applications, she was told that\r\nthe only way to obtain what she wanted was to address herself to a\r\nparticular clerk in a certain department of the ministry. Although he\r\nwas a mere clerk, he was the real head of his superiors, and could do\r\neverything. This man’s name was Gherásim Ivánovich Kruglóff.\r\n\r\n‘Imagine, our Garáska!’ she said to me afterward. ‘I always knew that\r\nhe had great capacity. I went to see him, and spoke to him about this\r\naffair, and he said, “I have nothing against the old prince, and I will\r\ndo all I can for him.”’\r\n\r\nGherásim kept his word: he made a favourable report, and my father got\r\nhis promotion. At last he could put on the long-coveted red trousers\r\nand the red-lined overcoat, and could wear the plumage on his helmet.\r\n\r\nThese were things which I myself saw in my childhood. If, however, I\r\nwere to relate what I heard of in those years it would be a much more\r\ngruesome narrative: stories of men and women torn from their families\r\nand their villages, and sold, or lost in gambling, or exchanged for a\r\ncouple of hunting dogs, and then transported to some remote part of\r\nRussia for the sake of creating a new estate; of children taken from\r\ntheir parents and sold to cruel or dissolute masters; of flogging ‘in\r\nthe stables,’ which occurred every day with unheard-of cruelty; of a\r\ngirl who found her only salvation in drowning herself; of an old man\r\nwho had grown grey-haired in his master’s service, and at last hanged\r\nhimself under his master’s window; and of revolts of serfs, which were\r\nsuppressed by Nicholas I.’s generals by flogging to death each tenth\r\nor fifth man taken out of the ranks, and by laying waste the village,\r\nwhose inhabitants, after a military execution, went begging for bread\r\nin the neighbouring provinces, as if they had been the victims of a\r\nconflagration. As to the poverty which I saw during our journeys in\r\ncertain villages, especially in those which belonged to the imperial\r\nfamily, no words would be adequate to describe the misery to readers\r\nwho have not seen it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo become free was the constant dream of the serfs--a dream not easily\r\nrealized, for a heavy sum of money was required to induce a landowner\r\nto part with a serf. ‘Do you know,’ my father said to me once, ‘that\r\nyour mother appeared to me after her death? You young people do not\r\nbelieve in these things, but it was so. I sat one night very late in\r\nthis chair, at my writing-table, and slumbered, when I saw her enter\r\nfrom behind, all in white, quite pale, and with her eyes gleaming.\r\nWhen she was dying she begged me to promise that I would give liberty\r\nto her maid, Másha, and I did promise; but then what with one thing\r\nand another, nearly a whole year passed without my having fulfilled my\r\nintention. Then she appeared, and said to me in a low voice, “Alexis,\r\nyou promised me to give liberty to Másha: have you forgotten it?” I\r\nwas quite terrified: I jumped out of my chair, but she had vanished. I\r\ncalled the servants, but no one had seen anything. Next morning I went\r\nto her grave and had a litany sung, and immediately gave liberty to\r\nMásha.’\r\n\r\nWhen my father died, Másha came to his burial, and I spoke to her. She\r\nwas married, and quite happy in her family life. My brother Alexander,\r\nin his jocose way, told her what my father had said, and we asked her\r\nwhat she knew of it.\r\n\r\n‘These things,’ she replied, ‘happened a long time ago, so I may tell\r\nyou the truth. I saw that your father had quite forgotten his promise,\r\nso I dressed up in white and spoke like your mother. I recalled the\r\npromise he had made to her--you won’t bear a grudge against me, will\r\nyou?’\r\n\r\n‘Of course not!’\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTen or twelve years after the scenes described in the early part of\r\nthis chapter, I sat one night in my father’s room, and we talked of\r\nthings past. Serfdom had been abolished, and my father complained of\r\nthe new conditions, though not very severely; he had accepted them\r\nwithout much grumbling.\r\n\r\n‘You must agree, father,’ I said, ‘that you often punished your\r\nservants cruelly, and without any reason.’\r\n\r\n‘With the people,’ he replied, ‘it was impossible to do otherwise;’\r\nand, leaning back in his easy-chair, he remained plunged in thought.\r\n‘But what I did was nothing worth speaking of,’ he said after a long\r\npause. ‘Take that same Sábleff: he looks so soft, and talks in such a\r\nmeek voice; but he was really terrible with his serfs. How many times\r\nthey plotted to kill him! I, at least, never took advantage of my\r\nmaids, whereas that old devil Tónkoff went on in such a way that the\r\npeasant women were going to inflict a terrible punishment upon him....\r\nGood-bye; _bonne nuit_!’\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nI well remember the Crimean war. At Moscow it affected people but\r\nlittle. Of course, in every house lint and bandages for the wounded\r\nwere made at evening parties; not much of it, however, reached the\r\nRussian armies, immense quantities being stolen and sold to the armies\r\nof the enemy. My sister Hélène and other young ladies sang patriotic\r\nsongs, but the general tone of life in society was hardly influenced by\r\nthe great struggle that was going on. In the country, on the contrary,\r\nthe war caused much gloominess. The levies of recruits followed one\r\nanother rapidly, and we continually heard the peasant women singing\r\ntheir funereal songs. The Russian people look upon war as a calamity\r\nwhich is being sent upon them by Providence, and they accepted this\r\nwar with a solemnity that contrasted strangely with the levity I saw\r\nelsewhere under similar circumstances. Young though I was, I realized\r\nthat feeling of solemn resignation which pervaded our villages.\r\n\r\nMy brother Nicholas was smitten like many others by the war fever, and\r\nbefore he had ended his course at the corps he joined the army in the\r\nCaucasus. I never saw him again.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1854 our family was increased by the arrival of two\r\nsisters of our stepmother. They had had their own house and some\r\nvineyards at Sebastopol, but now they were homeless, and came to stay\r\nwith us. When the allies landed in the Crimea, the inhabitants of\r\nSebastopol were told that they need not be afraid, and had only to stay\r\nwhere they were; but after the defeat at the Alma, they were ordered to\r\nleave with all haste, as the city would be invested within a few days.\r\nThere were few conveyances, and there was no way of moving along the\r\nroads in face of the troops which were marching southward. To hire a\r\ncart was almost impossible, and the ladies, having abandoned all they\r\nhad on the road, had a very hard time of it before they reached Moscow.\r\n\r\nI soon made friends with the younger of the two sisters, a lady of\r\nabout thirty, who used to smoke one cigarette after another, and to\r\ntell me of all the horrors of their journey. She spoke with tears in\r\nher eyes of the beautiful battle-ships which had to be sunk at the\r\nentrance of the harbour of Sebastopol, and she could not understand how\r\nthe Russians would be able to defend Sebastopol from the land; there\r\nwas no wall even worth speaking of.\r\n\r\nI was in my thirteenth year when Nicholas I. died. It was late in the\r\nafternoon of February 18 (March 2), that the policemen distributed in\r\nall the houses of Moscow a bulletin announcing the illness of the Tsar,\r\nand inviting the inhabitants to pray in the churches for his recovery.\r\nAt that time he was already dead, and the authorities knew it, as\r\nthere was telegraphic communication between Moscow and St. Petersburg;\r\nbut not a word having been previously uttered about his illness, they\r\nthought that the people must be gradually prepared for the announcement\r\nof his death. We all went to church and prayed most piously.\r\n\r\nNext day, Saturday, the same thing was done, and even on Sunday morning\r\nbulletins about the Tsar’s health were distributed. The news of the\r\ndeath of Nicholas reached us only about midday, through some servants\r\nwho had been to the market. A real terror reigned in our house and in\r\nthe houses of our relatives, as the information spread. It was said\r\nthat the people in the market behaved in a strange way, showing no\r\nregret, but indulging in dangerous talk. Full-grown people spoke in\r\nwhispers, and our stepmother kept repeating, ‘Don’t talk before the\r\nmen;’ while the servants whispered among themselves, probably about the\r\ncoming ‘freedom.’ The nobles expected at every moment a revolt of the\r\nserfs--a new uprising of Pugachóff.\r\n\r\nAt St. Petersburg, in the meantime, men of the educated classes, as\r\nthey communicated to one another the news, embraced in the streets.\r\nEveryone felt that the end of the war and the end of the terrible\r\nconditions which prevailed under the ‘iron despot’ were near at hand.\r\nPoisoning was talked about, the more so as the Tsar’s body decomposed\r\nvery rapidly, but the true reason only gradually leaked out: a too\r\nstrong dose of an invigorating medicine that Nicholas had taken.\r\n\r\nIn the country, during the summer of 1855, the heroic struggle which\r\nwas going on in Sebastopol for every yard of ground and every bit\r\nof its dismantled bastions was followed with a solemn interest. A\r\nmessenger was sent regularly twice a week from our house to the\r\ndistrict town to get the papers; and on his return, even before he had\r\ndismounted, the papers were taken from his hands and opened. Hélène or\r\nI read them aloud to the family, and the news was at once transmitted\r\nto the servants’ room, and thence to the kitchen, the office, the\r\npriest’s house, and the houses of the peasants. The reports which came\r\nof the last days of Sebastopol, of the awful bombardment, and finally\r\nof the evacuation of the town by our troops were received with tears.\r\nIn every country house round about, the loss of Sebastopol was mourned\r\nover with as much grief as the loss of a near relative would have been,\r\nalthough everyone understood that now the terrible war would soon come\r\nto an end.\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nIt was in August 1857, when I was nearly fifteen, that my turn came to\r\nenter the corps of pages and I was taken to St. Petersburg. When I left\r\nhome I was still a child; but human character is usually settled in a\r\ndefinite way at an earlier age than is generally supposed, and it is\r\nevident to me that under my childish appearance I was then very much\r\nwhat I was to be later on. My tastes, my inclinations, were already\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nThe first impulse to my intellectual development was given, as I have\r\nsaid, by my Russian teacher. It is an excellent habit in Russian\r\nfamilies--a habit now, unhappily, on the decline--to have in the house\r\na student who aids the boys and the girls with their lessons, even when\r\nthey are at a gymnasium. For a better assimilation of what they learn\r\nat school, and for a widening of their conceptions about what they\r\nlearn, his aid is invaluable. Moreover, he introduces an intellectual\r\nelement into the family and becomes an elder brother to the young\r\npeople--often something better than an elder brother, because the\r\nstudent has a certain responsibility for the progress of his pupils;\r\nand as the methods of teaching change rapidly, from one generation to\r\nanother, he can assist his pupils much better than the best educated\r\nparents could.\r\n\r\nNikolái Pávlovich Smirnóff had literary tastes. At that time, under\r\nthe wild censorship of Nicholas I., many quite inoffensive works by\r\nour best writers could not be published; others were so mutilated as\r\nto deprive many passages in them of any meaning. In the genial comedy\r\nby Griboyédoff, ‘Misfortune from Intelligence,’ which ranks with\r\nthe best comedies of Molière, Colonel Skalozúb had to be named ‘Mr.\r\nSkalozúb,’ to the detriment of the sense and even of the verses; for\r\nthe representation of a colonel in a comical light would have been\r\nconsidered an insult to the army. Of so innocent a book as Gógol’s\r\n‘Dead Souls’ the second part was not allowed to appear, nor the first\r\npart to be reprinted, although it had long been out of print. Numerous\r\nverses of Púshkin, Lérmontoff, A. K. Tolstóy, Ryléeff, and other poets\r\nwere not permitted to see the light; to say nothing of such verses as\r\nhad any political meaning or contained a criticism of the prevailing\r\nconditions. All these circulated in manuscript, and my teacher used to\r\ncopy whole books of Gógol and Púshkin for himself and his friends, a\r\ntask in which I occasionally helped him. As a true child of Moscow he\r\nwas also imbued with the deepest veneration for those of our writers\r\nwho lived in Moscow--some of them in the Old Equerries’ Quarter.\r\nHe pointed out to me with respect the house of the Countess Saliás\r\n(Eugénie Tour), who was our near neighbour, while the house of the\r\nnoted exile Alexander Hérzen always was associated with a certain\r\nmysterious feeling of respect and awe. The house where Gógol lived was\r\nfor us an object of deep respect, and though I was not nine when he\r\ndied (in 1851), and had read none of his works, I remember well the\r\nsadness his death produced at Moscow. Turguéneff well expressed that\r\nfeeling in a note, for which Nicholas I. ordered him to be put under\r\narrest and sent into exile to his estate.\r\n\r\nPushkin’s great poem, ‘Evghéniy Onyéghin,’ made but little impression\r\nupon me, and I still admire the marvellous simplicity and beauty of his\r\nstyle in that poem more than its contents. But Gógol’s works, which I\r\nread when I was eleven or twelve, had a powerful effect on my mind, and\r\nmy first literary essays were in imitation of his humorous manner. An\r\nhistorical novel by Zagóskin, ‘Yúriy Miloslávskiy,’ about the times of\r\nthe great uprising of 1612, Púshkin’s ‘The Captain’s Daughter,’ dealing\r\nwith the Pugachóff uprising, and Dumas’ ‘Queen Marguerite’ awakened\r\nin me a lasting interest in history. As to other French novels, I\r\nhave only begun to read them since Daudet and Zola came to the front.\r\nNekrásoff’s poetry was my favourite from early years: I knew many of\r\nhis verses by heart.\r\n\r\nNikolái Pávlovich Smirnóff early began to make me write, and with his\r\naid I wrote a long ‘History of a Sixpence,’ for which we invented all\r\nsorts of characters, into whose possession the sixpence fell.\r\n\r\nMy brother Alexander had at that time a much more poetical turn of\r\nmind. He wrote most romantic stories, and began early to make verses,\r\nwhich he did with wonderful facility and in a most musical and easy\r\nstyle. If his mind had not subsequently been taken up by natural\r\nhistory and philosophical studies, he undoubtedly would have become a\r\npoet of mark. In those years his favourite resort for finding poetical\r\ninspiration was the gently sloping roof underneath our window. This\r\naroused in me a constant desire to tease him. ‘There is the poet\r\nsitting under the chimney-pot, trying to write his verses,’ I used to\r\nsay; and the teasing ended in a fierce scrimmage, which brought our\r\nsister Hélène to a state of despair. But Alexander was so devoid of\r\nrevengefulness that peace was soon concluded, and we loved each other\r\nimmensely. Among boys, scrimmage and love seem to go hand in hand.\r\n\r\nI had even then taken to journalism. In my twelfth year I began to\r\nedit a daily journal. Paper was not to be had at will in our house,\r\nand my journal was of a Lilliputian size. As the Crimean war had not\r\nyet broken out, and the only newspaper which my father used to receive\r\nwas the Gazette of the Moscow Police, I had not a great choice of\r\nmodels. As a result my own Gazette consisted merely of short paragraphs\r\nannouncing the news of the day: as, ‘Went out to the woods. N. P.\r\nSmirnóff shot two thrushes,’ and the like.\r\n\r\nThis soon ceased to satisfy me, and in 1855 I started a monthly\r\nreview which contained Alexander’s verses, my novelettes, and some\r\nsort of ‘varieties.’ The material existence of this review was fully\r\nguaranteed, for it had plenty of subscribers; that is, the editor\r\nhimself and Smirnóff, who regularly paid his subscription, of so\r\nmany sheets of paper, even after he had left our house. In return, I\r\naccurately wrote out for my faithful subscriber a second copy.\r\n\r\nWhen Smirnóff left us, and a student of medicine, N. M. Pávloff, took\r\nhis place, the latter helped me in my editorial duties. He obtained for\r\nthe review a poem by one of his friends, and--still more important--the\r\nintroductory lecture on physical geography by one of the Moscow\r\nprofessors. Of course this had not been printed before: a reproduction\r\nwould never have found its way into so serious a publication.\r\n\r\nAlexander, I need not say, took a lively interest in the review, and\r\nits renown soon reached the corps of cadets. Some young writers on\r\nthe way to fame undertook the publication of a rival. The matter was\r\nserious: in poems and novels we could hold our own; but they had a\r\n‘critic,’ and a ‘critic’ who writes, in connection with the characters\r\nof some new novel, all sorts of things about the conditions of life,\r\nand touches upon a thousand questions which could not be touched upon\r\nanywhere else, makes the soul of a Russian review. They had a critic,\r\nand we had none! Happily enough, the article he wrote for the first\r\nnumber was shown to my brother. It was rather pretentious and weak, and\r\nAlexander at once wrote an anti-criticism, ridiculing and demolishing\r\nthe critic in a violent manner. There was great consternation in the\r\nrival camp when they learned that this anti-criticism would appear\r\nin our next issue; they gave up publishing their review and their\r\nbest writers joined our staff. We triumphantly announced the future\r\n‘exclusive collaboration’ of so many distinguished writers.\r\n\r\nIn August 1857 the review had to be suspended, after nearly two years’\r\nexistence. New surroundings and a quite new life were before me. I went\r\naway from home with regret, the more so because the whole distance\r\nbetween Moscow and St. Petersburg would be between me and Alexander,\r\nand I already considered it a misfortune that I had to enter a military\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART SECOND\r\n\r\nTHE CORPS OF PAGES\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe long-cherished ambition of my father was thus realized. There\r\nwas a vacancy in the corps of pages which I could fill before I had\r\ngot beyond the age to which admission was limited, and I was taken\r\nto St. Petersburg and entered the school. Only a hundred and fifty\r\nboys--mostly children of the nobility belonging to the court--received\r\neducation in this privileged corps, which combined the character of a\r\nmilitary school endowed with special rights and of a court institution\r\nattached to the imperial household. After a stay of four or five years\r\nin the corps of pages, those who had passed the final examinations were\r\nreceived as officers in any regiment of the Guard or of the army they\r\nchose, irrespective of the number of vacancies in that regiment; and\r\neach year the first sixteen pupils of the highest form were nominated\r\n_pages de chambre_: that is, they were personally attached to the\r\nseveral members of the imperial family--the emperor, the empress, the\r\ngrand duchesses, and the grand dukes. That was considered, of course,\r\na great honour; and, moreover, the young men upon whom this honour was\r\nbestowed became known at the court, and had afterward every chance of\r\nbeing nominated aides-de-camp of the emperor or of one of the grand\r\ndukes, and consequently had every facility for making a brilliant\r\ncareer in the service of the State. Fathers and mothers took due\r\ncare, therefore, that their boys should not miss entering the corps of\r\npages, even though entrance had to be secured at the expense of other\r\ncandidates who never saw a vacancy opening for them. Now that I was in\r\nthe select corps my father could give free play to his ambitious dreams.\r\n\r\nThe corps was divided into five forms, of which the highest was the\r\nfirst, and the lowest the fifth, and the intention was that I should\r\nenter the fourth form. However, as it appeared at the examinations that\r\nI was not sufficiently familiar with decimal fractions, and as the\r\nfourth form contained that year over forty pupils, while only twenty\r\nhad been mustered for the fifth form, I was enrolled in the latter.\r\n\r\nI felt extremely vexed at this decision. It was with reluctance that\r\nI entered a military school, and now I should have to stay in it five\r\nyears instead of four. What should I do in the fifth form, when I\r\nknew already all that would be taught in it? With tears in my eyes I\r\nspoke of it to the inspector (the head of the educational department),\r\nbut he answered me with a joke. ‘You know,’ he told me, ‘what Cæsar\r\nsaid--better to be the first in a village than the second in Rome.’ To\r\nwhich I warmly replied that I should prefer to be the very last if only\r\nI could leave the military school as soon as possible. ‘Perhaps, after\r\nsome time, you will like the school,’ he remarked, and from that day he\r\nbecame friendly to me.\r\n\r\nTo the teacher of arithmetic, who also tried to console me, I gave my\r\nword of honour that I would never cast a glance into his text-book;\r\n‘and nevertheless you will have to give me the highest marks.’ I kept\r\nmy word; but thinking now of this scene, I fancy that the pupil was not\r\nof a very docile disposition.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, as I look back upon that remote past, I cannot but feel\r\ngrateful for having been put in the lower form. Having only to repeat\r\nduring the first year what I already knew, I got into the habit of\r\nlearning my lessons by merely listening to what the teachers said in\r\nthe class-room; and, the lessons over, I had plenty of time to read and\r\nto write to my heart’s content. I never prepared for the examinations,\r\nand used to spend the time which was allowed for that in reading aloud\r\nto a few friends the dramas of Shakespeare or of Ostróvskiy. When I\r\nreached the higher ‘special’ forms, I was also better prepared to\r\nmaster the variety of subjects we had to study. Besides, I spent more\r\nthan half of the first winter in the hospital. Like all children who\r\nare not born at St. Petersburg, I had to pay a heavy tribute to ‘the\r\ncapital on the swamps of Finland,’ in the shape of several attacks of\r\nlocal cholera, and finally one of typhoid fever.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen I entered the corps of pages, its inner life was undergoing a\r\nprofound change. All Russia awakened at that time from the heavy\r\nslumber and the terrible nightmare of Nicholas I.’s reign. Our school\r\nalso felt the effects of that revival. I do not know, in fact, what\r\nwould have become of me, had I entered the corps of pages one or\r\ntwo years sooner. Either my will would have been totally broken, or\r\nI should have been excluded from the school with no one knows what\r\nconsequences. Happily, the transition period was already in full sway\r\nin the year 1857.\r\n\r\nThe director of the corps was an excellent old man, General Zheltúkhin.\r\nBut he was the nominal head only. The real master of the school was\r\n‘the Colonel,’--Colonel Girardot, a Frenchman in the Russian service.\r\nPeople said he was a Jesuit, and so he was, I believe. His ways, at\r\nany rate, were thoroughly imbued with the teachings of Loyola, and his\r\neducational methods were those of the French Jesuit colleges.\r\n\r\nImagine a short, extremely thin man, with dark, piercing, and\r\nfurtive eyes, wearing short-clipped moustaches, which gave him the\r\nexpression of a cat; very quiet and firm; not remarkably intelligent,\r\nbut exceedingly cunning; a despot at the bottom of his heart, who\r\nwas capable of hating--intensely hating--the boy who would not\r\nfall under his fascination, and of expressing that hatred, not by\r\nsilly persecutions, but unceasingly by his general behaviour--by an\r\noccasionally dropped word, a gesture, a smile, an interjection. His\r\nwalk was more like gliding along, and the exploring glances he used to\r\ncast round without turning his head completed the illusion. A stamp\r\nof cold dryness was impressed on his lips, even when he tried to look\r\nwell disposed, and that expression became still more harsh when his\r\nmouth was contorted by a smile of discontent or of contempt. With all\r\nthis there was nothing of a commander in him; you would rather think,\r\nat first sight, of a benevolent father who talks to his children as if\r\nthey were full-grown people. And yet, you soon felt that everyone and\r\neverything had to bend before his will. Woe to the boy who would not\r\nfeel happy or unhappy according to the degree of good disposition shown\r\ntowards him by the Colonel.\r\n\r\nThe words ‘the Colonel’ were continually on all lips. Other officers\r\nwent by their nicknames, but no one dared to give a nickname to\r\nGirardot. A sort of mystery hung about him, as if he were omniscient\r\nand everywhere present. True, he spent all the day and part of the\r\nnight in the school. Even when we were in the classes he prowled about,\r\nvisiting our drawers, which he opened with his own keys. As to the\r\nnight, he gave a good portion of it to the task of inscribing in small\r\nbooks--of which he had quite a library--in separate columns, by special\r\nsigns and in inks of different colours, all the faults and virtues of\r\neach boy.\r\n\r\nPlay, jokes, and conversations stopped when we saw him slowly moving\r\nalong through our spacious rooms, hand in hand with one of his\r\nfavourites, balancing his body forward and backward; smiling at one\r\nboy, keenly looking into the eyes of another, casting an indifferent\r\nglance upon a third, and giving a slight contortion to his lip as he\r\npassed a fourth: and from these looks everyone knew that he liked the\r\nfirst boy, that to the second he was indifferent, that he intentionally\r\ndid not notice the third, and that he disliked the fourth. This dislike\r\nwas enough to terrify most of his victims--the more so as no reason\r\ncould be given for it. Impressionable boys had been brought to despair\r\nby that mute, unceasingly displayed aversion and those suspicious\r\nlooks; in others the result had been a total annihilation of will, as\r\none of the Tolstóys--Theodor, also a pupil of Girardot--has shown in an\r\nautobiographic novel, the ‘Diseases of the Will.’\r\n\r\nThe inner life of the corps was miserable under the rule of the\r\nColonel. In all boarding-schools the newly entered boys are subjected\r\nto petty persecutions. The ‘greenhorns’ are put in this way to a\r\ntest. What are they worth? Are they not going to turn ‘sneaks?’ And\r\nthen the ‘old hands’ like to show to new-comers the superiority of an\r\nestablished brotherhood. So it is in all schools and in prisons. But\r\nunder Girardot’s rule these persecutions took on a harsher aspect, and\r\nthey came, not from the comrades of the same form, but from the first\r\nform--the pages de chambre, who were non-commissioned officers, and\r\nwhom Girardot had placed in a quite exceptional, superior position.\r\nHis system was to give them carte blanche; to pretend that he did not\r\nknow even the horrors they were enacting; and to maintain through\r\nthem a severe discipline. To answer a blow received from a page de\r\nchambre would have meant, in the times of Nicholas I., to be sent\r\nto a battalion of soldiers’ sons, if the fact became public; and to\r\nrevolt in any way against the mere caprice of a page de chambre meant\r\nthat the twenty youths of the first form, armed with their heavy oak\r\nrulers, would assemble in a room, and, with Girardot’s tacit approval,\r\nadminister a severe beating to the boy who had shown such a spirit of\r\ninsubordination.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the first form did what they liked; and not farther back\r\nthan the preceding winter one of their favourite games had been to\r\nassemble the ‘greenhorns’ at night in a room, in their night-shirts,\r\nand to make them run round, like horses in a circus, while the pages\r\nde chambre, armed with thick india-rubber whips, standing some in the\r\ncentre and the others on the outside, pitilessly whipped the boys. As a\r\nrule the ‘circus’ ended in an Oriental fashion, in an abominable way.\r\nThe moral conceptions which prevailed at that time, and the foul talk\r\nwhich went on in the school concerning what occurred at night after a\r\ncircus, were such that the least said about them the better.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel knew all this. He had a perfectly organized system of\r\nespionage, and nothing escaped his knowledge. But so long as he was\r\nnot known to know it, all was right. To shut his eyes to what was done\r\nby the first form was the foundation of his system of maintaining\r\ndiscipline.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHowever, a new spirit was awakened in the school, and only a few\r\nmonths before I entered it a revolution had taken place. That year the\r\nthird form was different from what it had hitherto been. It contained\r\na number of young men who really studied, and read a good deal; some\r\nof them became, later, men of mark. My first acquaintance with one\r\nof them--let me call him von Schauff--was when he was reading Kant’s\r\n‘Critique of Pure Reason.’ Besides, they had amongst them some of the\r\nstrongest youths of the school. The tallest member of the corps was in\r\nthat form, as also a very strong young man, Kóshtoff, a great friend of\r\nvon Schauff.\r\n\r\nThis third form did not bear the yoke of the pages de chambre with the\r\nsame docility as their predecessors; they were disgusted with what was\r\ngoing on, and in consequence of an incident, which I prefer not to\r\ndescribe, a fight took place between the third and the first form,\r\nwith the result that the pages de chambre got a severe thrashing from\r\ntheir subordinates. Girardot hushed up the affair, but the authority of\r\nthe first form was broken down. The india-rubber whips remained, but\r\nwere never again brought into use. The circuses and the like became\r\nthings of the past.\r\n\r\nThat much was won; but the lowest form, the fifth, composed almost\r\nentirely of very young boys who had just entered the school, had still\r\nto obey the petty caprices of the pages de chambre. We had a beautiful\r\ngarden, filled with old trees, but the boys of the fifth form could\r\nenjoy it little; they were forced to run a roundabout, while the first\r\nform boys sat in it and chattered, or to send back the balls when these\r\ngentlemen played nine-pins. A couple of days after I had entered the\r\nschool, seeing how things stood in the garden, I did not go there, but\r\nremained upstairs. I was reading, when a page de chambre, with carroty\r\nhair and a face covered with freckles, came upon me, and ordered me to\r\ngo at once to the garden to run the roundabout.\r\n\r\n‘I sha’n’t; don’t you see I am reading,’ was my reply.\r\n\r\nAnger disfigured his never too pleasant face. He was ready to jump upon\r\nme. I took the defensive. He tried to give me blows on the face with\r\nhis cap. I fenced as best I could. Then he flung his cap on the floor.\r\n\r\n‘Pick it up.’\r\n\r\n‘Pick it up yourself.’\r\n\r\nSuch an act of disobedience was unheard of in the school. Why he did\r\nnot beat me unmercifully on the spot I do not know. He was much older\r\nand stronger than I was.\r\n\r\nNext day and the following days I received similar commands, but\r\nobstinately remained upstairs. Then began the most exasperating petty\r\npersecutions at every step--enough to drive a boy to desperation.\r\nHappily, I was always of a jovial disposition, and answered them with\r\njokes, or took little heed of them.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it all soon came to an end. The weather turned rainy, and we\r\nspent most of our time indoors. In the garden the first form smoked\r\nfreely enough, but when we were indoors the smoking club was ‘the\r\ntower.’ It was kept beautifully clean, and a fire was always burning\r\nthere. The pages de chambre severely punished any of the other boys\r\nwhom they caught smoking, but they themselves sat continually at the\r\nfireside chattering and enjoying cigarettes. Their favourite smoking\r\ntime was after ten o’clock at night, when all were supposed to have\r\ngone to bed; they kept up their club till half-past eleven, and, to\r\nprotect themselves from an unexpected interruption by Girardot, they\r\nordered us to be on the watch. The small boys of the fifth form were\r\ntaken out of their beds in turn, two at a time, and they had to loiter\r\nabout the staircase till half-past eleven, to give notice of the\r\napproach of the Colonel.\r\n\r\nWe decided to put an end to these night watches. Long were the\r\ndiscussions, and the higher forms were consulted as to what was to\r\nbe done. At last the decision came: ‘Refuse, all of you, to keep the\r\nwatch; and when they begin to beat you, which they are sure to do, go,\r\nas many of you as you can, in a block, and call in Girardot. He knows\r\nit all, but then he will be bound to stop it.’ The question whether\r\nthat would not be ‘reporting’ was settled in the negative by experts\r\nin matters of honour: the pages de chambre did not behave towards the\r\nothers like comrades.\r\n\r\nThe turn to watch fell that night to a Prince Shahovskóy, an old\r\nhand, and to Selánoff, a new-comer, an extremely timid boy, who even\r\nspoke in a girlish voice. The old hand was called upon first, but\r\nrefused to go, and was left alone. Then two pages de chambre went to\r\nthe timid new-comer, who was in bed; and as he refused to obey, they\r\nbegan to flog him brutally with heavy leather braces. Shahovskóy woke\r\nup several comrades who were near at hand, and they all ran to find\r\nGirardot.\r\n\r\nI was also in bed when the two came upon me, ordering me to take the\r\nwatch. I refused. Thereupon, seizing two pairs of braces--we always\r\nused to put our clothes in perfect order on a bench by the bedside,\r\nbraces uppermost, and the necktie across them--they began to flog me.\r\nSitting up in bed, I fenced with my hands, and had already received\r\nseveral heavy blows, when a command resounded, ‘The first form to the\r\nColonel!’ The fierce fighters became tame at once, and hurriedly put my\r\nthings in order.\r\n\r\n‘Don’t say a word,’ they whispered.\r\n\r\n‘The necktie across, in good order,’ I said to them, while my shoulders\r\nand arms burned from the blows.\r\n\r\nWhat Girardot’s talk with the first form was we did not know; but\r\nnext day, as we stood in the ranks before marching downstairs to the\r\ndining-room, he addressed us in a minor key, saying how sad it was that\r\npages de chambre should have fallen upon a boy who was right in his\r\nrefusal. And upon whom? A new-comer, and so timid a boy as Selánoff\r\nwas! The whole school was disgusted at this Jesuitic speech.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt surely was also a blow to Girardot’s authority, and he resented it\r\nvery much. He regarded our form, and me especially, with great dislike\r\n(the roundabout affair had been reported to him), and he manifested it\r\nat every opportunity.\r\n\r\nDuring the first winter I was a frequent inmate of the hospital. After\r\nsuffering from typhoid fever, during which the director and the doctor\r\nbestowed on me a really parental care, I had very bad and persistently\r\nrecurring gastric attacks. Girardot, as he made his daily rounds of the\r\nhospital, seeing me so often there, began to say to me every morning,\r\nhalf-jokingly, in French, ‘Here is a young man who is as healthy as\r\nthe New Bridge, and loiters in the hospital.’ Once or twice I replied\r\njestingly, but at last, seeing malice in this constant repetition, I\r\nlost patience and grew very angry.\r\n\r\n‘How dare you say that?’ I exclaimed. ‘I shall ask the doctor to forbid\r\nyour entering this room,’ and so on.\r\n\r\nGirardot recoiled two steps; his dark eyes glittered, his thin lip\r\nbecame still thinner. At last he said, ‘I have offended you, have I?\r\nWell, we have in the hall two artillery guns: shall we have a duel?’\r\n\r\n‘I don’t make jokes, and I tell you that I shall bear no more of your\r\ninsinuations’, I continued.\r\n\r\nHe did not repeat his joke, but regarded me with even more dislike than\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nHappily enough, there was little opportunity for punishing me. I did\r\nnot smoke; my clothes were always hooked and buttoned, and properly\r\nfolded at night. I liked all sorts of games, but, plunged as I was in\r\nreading and in a correspondence with my brother, I could hardly find\r\ntime to play a _laptá_ match (a sort of cricket) in the garden, and\r\nalways hurried back to my books. But when I was caught in fault, it\r\nwas not I that Girardot punished, but the page de chambre who was my\r\nsuperior. Once, for instance, at dinner, I made a physical discovery:\r\nI noticed that the sound given out by a tumbler depends on the amount\r\nof water it contains, and at once tried to obtain a chord with four\r\nglasses. But there stood Girardot behind me, and without saying a word\r\nto me he ordered my page de chambre under arrest. It so happened that\r\nthis young man was an excellent fellow, a third cousin of mine, who\r\nrefused even to listen to my excuses, saying, ‘All right. I know he\r\ndislikes you.’ His comrades, though, gave me a warning. ‘Take care,\r\nnaughty boy; we are not going to be punished for you,’ they said; and\r\nif reading had not been my all-absorbing occupation, they probably\r\nwould have made me pay dearly for my physical experiment.\r\n\r\nEveryone spoke of Girardot’s dislike for me; but I paid no attention\r\nto it, and probably increased it by my indifference. For full eighteen\r\nmonths he refused to give me the epaulettes, which were usually given\r\nto newly entered boys after one or two months’ stay at the school, when\r\nthey had learned some of the rudiments of military drill; but I felt\r\nquite happy without that military decoration. At last, an officer--the\r\nbest teacher of drill in the school, a man simply enamoured of\r\ndrill--volunteered to teach me; and when he saw me performing all the\r\ntricks to his entire satisfaction, he undertook to introduce me to\r\nGirardot. The Colonel refused again, twice in succession, so that the\r\nofficer took it as a personal offence; and when the director of the\r\ncorps once asked him why I had no epaulettes yet, he bluntly answered,\r\n‘The boy is all right; it is the Colonel who does not want him;’\r\nwhereupon, probably after the remark of the director, Girardot himself\r\nasked to examine me again, and gave me the epaulettes that very day.\r\n\r\nBut the Colonel’s influence was rapidly vanishing. The whole character\r\nof the school was changing. For twenty years Girardot had realized his\r\nideal, which was to have the boys nicely combed, curled, and girlish\r\nlooking, and to send to the court pages as refined as courtiers of\r\nLouis XIV. Whether they learned or not, he cared little; his favourites\r\nwere those whose clothes-basket was best filled with all sorts of\r\nnail-brushes and scent-bottles, whose ‘private’ uniform (which could\r\nbe put on when we went home on Sundays) was of the best make, and who\r\nknew how to make the most elegant _salut oblique_. Formerly, when\r\nGirardot had held rehearsals of court ceremonies, wrapping up a page\r\nin a striped red cotton cover taken from one of our beds, in order\r\nthat he might represent the Empress at a _baisemain_, the boys almost\r\nreligiously approached the imaginary Empress, seriously performed\r\nthe ceremony of kissing the hand, and retired with a most elegant\r\noblique bow; but now, though they were very elegant at court, they\r\nwould perform at the rehearsals such bearlike bows that all roared\r\nwith laughter, while Girardot was simply raging. Formerly, the younger\r\nboys who had been taken to a court levee, and had been curled for that\r\npurpose, used to keep their curls as long as they would last; now, on\r\nreturning from the palace, they hurried to put their heads under the\r\ncold water tap, to get rid of the curls. An effeminate appearance was\r\nlaughed at. To be sent to a levee, to stand there as a decoration, was\r\nnow considered a drudgery rather than a favour. And when the small boys\r\nwho were occasionally taken to the palace to play with the little grand\r\ndukes remarked that one of the latter used, in some game, to make a\r\nhard whip out of his handkerchief, and use it freely, one of our boys\r\ndid the same, and so whipped the grand duke that he cried. Girardot was\r\nterrified, while the old Sebastopol admiral who was tutor of the grand\r\nduke only praised our boy.\r\n\r\nA new spirit, studious and serious, developed in the corps, as in all\r\nother schools. In former years, the pages, being sure in one way or\r\nanother that they would get the necessary marks for being promoted\r\nofficers of the Guard, spent the first years in the school hardly\r\nlearning at all, and only began to study more or less in the last two\r\nforms; now the lower forms learned very well. The moral tone also\r\nbecame quite different from what it was a few years before. Oriental\r\namusements were looked upon with disgust, and an attempt or two to\r\nrevert to old manners resulted in scandals which reached the St.\r\nPetersburg drawing-rooms. Girardot was dismissed. He was only allowed\r\nto retain his bachelor apartment in the building of the corps, and we\r\noften saw him afterward, wrapped in his long military cloak, pacing\r\nalong, plunged in reflections--sad, I suppose, because he could not but\r\ncondemn the new spirit which rapidly developed in the corps of pages.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nAll over Russia people were talking of education. As soon as peace\r\nhad been concluded at Paris, and the severity of censorship had been\r\nslightly relaxed, educational matters began to be eagerly discussed.\r\nThe ignorance of the masses of the people, the obstacles that had\r\nhitherto been put in the way of those who wanted to learn, the absence\r\nof schools in the country, the obsolete methods of teaching, and the\r\nremedies for these evils became favourite themes of discussion in\r\neducated circles, in the press, and even in the drawing-rooms of the\r\naristocracy. The first high schools for girls had been opened in 1857,\r\non an excellent plan and with a splendid teaching staff. As by magic\r\na number of men and women came to the front who have not only devoted\r\ntheir lives to education, but have proved to be remarkable practical\r\npedagogists: their writings would occupy a place of honour in every\r\ncivilized literature, if they were known abroad.\r\n\r\nThe corps of pages also felt the effect of that revival. Apart from a\r\nfew exceptions, the general tendency of the three younger forms was to\r\nstudy. The head of the educational department, the inspector, Winkler,\r\nwho was a well-educated colonel of artillery, a good mathematician,\r\nand a man of progressive opinions, hit upon an excellent plan for\r\nstimulating that spirit. Instead of the indifferent teachers who\r\nformerly used to teach in the lower forms, he endeavoured to secure\r\nthe best ones. In his opinion, no professor was too good to teach the\r\nvery beginnings of a subject to the youngest boys. Thus, to teach\r\nthe elements of algebra in the fourth form he invited a first-rate\r\nmathematician and a born teacher, Captain Sukhónin, and the form took\r\nat once to mathematics. By the way, it so happened that this captain\r\nwas a tutor of the heir of the throne (Nikolái Alexándrovich, who died\r\nat the age of twenty-two), and the heir-apparent was brought once a\r\nweek to the corps of pages to be present at the algebra lessons of\r\nCaptain Sukhónin. The Empress Marie Alexándrovna, who was an educated\r\nwoman, thought that perhaps the contact with studious boys would\r\nstimulate her son to learning. He sat among us, and had to answer\r\nquestions like all the others. But he managed mostly, while the teacher\r\nspoke, to make drawings, very nicely, or to whisper all sorts of droll\r\nthings to his neighbours. He was good-natured and very gentle in\r\nhis behaviour, but superficial in learning and still more so in his\r\naffections.\r\n\r\nFor the fifth form the inspector secured two remarkable men. He entered\r\nour class-room, one day, quite radiant, and told us that we should\r\nhave a rare chance. Professor Klasóvsky, a great classical scholar\r\nand expert in Russian literature, had consented to teach us Russian\r\ngrammar, and would take us through all the five forms in succession,\r\nshifting with us every year to the next form. Another university\r\nprofessor, Herr Becker, librarian of the imperial (national) library,\r\nwould do the same in German. Professor Klasóvsky, he added, was in weak\r\nhealth that winter, but the inspector was sure that we would be very\r\nquiet in his class. The chance of having such a teacher was too good to\r\nbe lost.\r\n\r\nHe had thought aright. We became very proud of having university\r\nprofessors for teachers, and although there came voices from the\r\nKamchátka (in Russia, the back benches of each class bear the name\r\nof that remote and uncivilized peninsula) to the effect that ‘the\r\nsausage-maker’--that is, the German--must be kept by all means in\r\nobedience, public opinion in our form was decidedly in favour of the\r\nprofessors.\r\n\r\n‘The sausage-maker’ won our respect at once. A tall man, with an\r\nimmense forehead and very kind, intelligent eyes, slightly veiled by\r\nhis spectacles, came into our class, and told us in quite good Russian\r\nthat he intended to divide our form into three sections. The first\r\nsection would be composed of Germans, who already knew the language,\r\nand from whom he would require more serious work; to the second section\r\nhe would teach grammar, and later on German literature, in accordance\r\nwith the established programmes; and the third section, he concluded\r\nwith a charming smile, would be the Kamchátka, ‘From you,’ he said, ‘I\r\nshall only require that at each lesson you copy four lines which I will\r\nchoose for you from a book. The four lines copied, you can do what you\r\nlike; only do not hinder the rest. And I promise you that in five years\r\nyou will learn something of German and German literature. Now, who\r\njoins the Germans? You, Stackelberg? You, Lamsdorf? Perhaps some one\r\nof the Russians? And who joins the Kamchátka?’ Five or six boys, who\r\nknew not a word of German, took residence in the peninsula. They most\r\nconscientiously copied their four lines--a dozen or a score of lines\r\nin the higher forms--and Becker chose the lines so well, and bestowed\r\nso much attention upon the boys that by the end of the five years they\r\nreally knew something of the language and its literature.\r\n\r\nI joined the Germans. My brother Alexander insisted so much in his\r\nletters upon my acquiring German, which possesses so rich a literature\r\nand into which every book of value is translated, that I set myself\r\nassiduously to learn it. I translated and studied most thoroughly one\r\npage of a rather difficult poetical description of a thunderstorm; I\r\nlearned by heart, as the professor had advised me, the conjugations,\r\nthe adverbs, and the prepositions--and began to read. A splendid method\r\nit is for learning languages. Becker advised me, moreover, to subscribe\r\nto a cheap illustrated weekly, and its illustrations and short stories\r\nwere a continual inducement to read a few lines or a column. I soon\r\nmastered the language.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the winter I asked Herr Becker to lend me a copy of\r\nGoethe’s ‘Faust.’ I had read it in a Russian translation; I had also\r\nread Turguéneff’s beautiful novel, ‘Faust’; and I now longed to read\r\nthe great work in the original. ‘You will understand nothing in it;\r\nit is too philosophical,’ Becker said, with his gentle smile; but he\r\nbrought me, nevertheless, a little square book, with the pages yellowed\r\nby age, containing the immortal drama. He little knew the unfathomable\r\njoy that that small square book gave me. I drank in the sense and the\r\nmusic of every line of it, beginning with the very first verses of\r\nthe ideally beautiful dedication, and soon knew full pages by heart.\r\nFaust’s monologue in the forest, and especially the lines in which he\r\nspeaks of his understanding of nature,\r\n\r\n                                     Thou\r\n    Not only cold, amazed acquaintance yield’st,\r\n    But grantest that in her profoundest breast\r\n    I gaze, as in the bosom of a friend,\r\n\r\nsimply put me in ecstasy, and till now it has retained its power over\r\nme. Every verse gradually became a dear friend. And then, is there\r\na higher æsthetic delight than to read poetry in a language which\r\none does not quite thoroughly understand? The whole is veiled with a\r\nsort of slight haze, which admirably suits poetry. Words, the trivial\r\nmeanings of which, when one knows the language colloquially, sometimes\r\ninterfere with the poetical image they are intended to convey, retain\r\nbut their subtle, elevated sense; while the music of the poetry is only\r\nthe more strongly impressed upon the ear.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nProfessor Klasóvsky’s first lesson was a revelation to us. He was a\r\nsmall man, about fifty years of age, very rapid in his movements, with\r\nbright, intelligent eyes, a slightly sarcastic expression, and the high\r\nforehead of a poet. When he came in for his first lesson, he said in a\r\nlow voice that, suffering from a protracted illness, he could not speak\r\nloud enough, and asked us, therefore, to sit closer to him. He placed\r\nhis chair near the first row of tables, and we clustered round him\r\nlike a swarm of bees.\r\n\r\nHe was to teach us Russian grammar; but, instead of the dull grammar\r\nlesson, we heard something quite different from what we expected. It\r\nwas grammar: but here came in a comparison of an old Russian folklore\r\nexpression with a line from Homer or from the Sanskrit Mahabharata,\r\nthe beauty of which was rendered in Russian words; there, a verse from\r\nSchiller was introduced, and was followed by a sarcastic remark about\r\nsome modern society prejudice; then solid grammar again, and then some\r\nwide poetical or philosophical generalization.\r\n\r\nOf course, there was much in it that we did not understand, or of which\r\nwe missed the deeper sense. But do not the bewitching powers of all\r\nstudies lie in that they continually open up to us new and unsuspected\r\nhorizons, not yet understood, which entice us to proceed farther and\r\nfarther in the penetration of what appears at first sight only in vague\r\noutline? Some with their hands placed on one another’s shoulders, some\r\nleaning across the tables of the first row, others standing close\r\nbehind Klasóvsky, we all hung on his lips. As toward the end of the\r\nhour his voice fell, the more breathlessly we listened. The inspector\r\nopened the door of the class-room, to see how we behaved with our new\r\nteacher; but on seeing that motionless swarm he retired on tiptoe. Even\r\nDaúroff, a restless spirit, stared at Klasóvsky as if to say, ‘That\r\nis the sort of man you are?’ Even von Kleinau, a hopelessly obtuse\r\nCircassian with a German name, sat motionless. In most of the others\r\nsomething good and elevated simmered at the bottom of their hearts,\r\nas if a vision of an unsuspected world was opening before them. Upon\r\nme Klasóvsky had an immense influence, which only grew with years.\r\nWinkler’s prophecy, that, after all, I might like the school, was\r\nfulfilled.\r\n\r\nIn western Europe, and probably in America, this type of teacher\r\nseems not to be widely spread; but in Russia there is not a man or\r\nwoman of mark, in literature or in political life, who does not owe\r\nthe first impulse toward a higher development to his or her teacher of\r\nliterature. Every school in the world ought to have such a teacher.\r\nEach teacher in a school has his own subject, and there is no link\r\nbetween the different subjects. Only the teacher of literature, guided\r\nby the general outlines of the programme, but left free to treat it as\r\nhe likes, can bind together the separate historical and humanitarian\r\nsciences, unify them by a broad philosophical and humane conception,\r\nand awaken higher ideas and inspirations in the brains and hearts of\r\nyoung people. In Russia, that necessary task falls quite naturally upon\r\nthe teacher of Russian literature. As he speaks of the development of\r\nthe language, of the contents of the early epic poetry, of popular\r\nsongs and music, and, later on, of modern fiction, of the scientific,\r\npolitical, and philosophical literature of his own country, and the\r\ndivers æsthetical, political, and philosophical currents it has\r\nreflected, he is bound to introduce that generalized conception of the\r\ndevelopment of the human mind which lies beyond the scope of each of\r\nthe subjects that are taught separately.\r\n\r\nThe same thing ought to be done for the natural sciences as well. It is\r\nnot enough to teach physics and chemistry, astronomy and meteorology,\r\nzoology and botany. The philosophy of all the natural sciences--a\r\ngeneral view of nature as a whole, something on the lines of the\r\nfirst volume of Humboldt’s ‘Cosmos’--must be conveyed to the pupils\r\nand the students, whatsoever may be the extension given to the study\r\nof the natural sciences in the school. The philosophy and the poetry\r\nof nature, the methods of all the exact sciences, and an inspired\r\nconception of the life of nature must make part of education. Perhaps\r\nthe teacher of geography might provisionally assume this function;\r\nbut then we should require quite a different set of teachers of this\r\nsubject, and a different set of professors of geography in the\r\nuniversities would be needed. What is now taught under this name is\r\nanything you like, but it is not geography.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother teacher conquered our rather uproarious form in a quite\r\ndifferent manner. It was the teacher of writing, the last one of the\r\nteaching staff. If the ‘heathen’--that is, the German and the French\r\nteachers--were regarded with little respect, the teacher of writing,\r\nEbert, who was a German Jew, was a real martyr. To be insolent with him\r\nwas a sort of _chic_ amongst the pages. His poverty alone must have\r\nbeen the reason why he kept to his lesson in our corps. The old hands,\r\nwho had stayed for two or three years in the fifth form without moving\r\nhigher up, treated him very badly; but by some means or other he had\r\nmade an agreement with them: ‘One frolic during each lesson, but no\r\nmore’--an agreement which, I am afraid, was not always honestly kept on\r\nour side.\r\n\r\nOne day, one of the residents of the remote peninsula soaked the\r\nblackboard sponge with ink and chalk and flung it at the caligraphy\r\nmartyr. ‘Get it, Ebert!’ he shouted, with a stupid smile. The sponge\r\ntouched Ebert’s shoulder, the grimy ink spirted into his face and down\r\non to his white shirt.\r\n\r\nWe were sure that this time Ebert would leave the room and report\r\nthe fact to the inspector. But he only exclaimed, as he took out his\r\ncotton handkerchief and wiped his face, ‘Gentlemen, one frolic--no\r\nmore to-day! The shirt is spoiled,’ he added in a subdued voice, and\r\ncontinued to correct someone’s book.\r\n\r\nWe looked stupefied and ashamed. Why, instead of reporting, he had\r\nthought at once of the agreement! The feelings of the whole class\r\nturned in his favour. ‘What you have done is stupid,’ we reproached our\r\ncomrade. ‘He is a poor man, and you have spoiled his shirt! Shame!’\r\nsomebody cried.\r\n\r\nThe culprit went at once to make excuses. ‘One must learn, sir,’ was\r\nall that Ebert said in reply, with sadness in his voice.\r\n\r\nAll became silent after that, and at the next lesson, as if we\r\nhad settled it beforehand, most of us wrote in our best possible\r\nhandwriting, and took our books to Ebert, asking him to correct them.\r\nHe was radiant, he felt happy that day.\r\n\r\nThis fact deeply impressed me, and was never wiped out from my memory.\r\nTo this day I feel grateful to that remarkable man for his lesson.\r\n\r\nWith our teacher of drawing, who was named Ganz, we never arrived at\r\nliving on good terms. He continually reported those who played in his\r\nclass. This, in our opinion, he had no right to do, because he was only\r\na teacher of drawing, but especially because he was not an honest man.\r\nIn the class he paid little attention to most of us, and spent his\r\ntime in improving the drawings of those who took private lessons from\r\nhim, or paid him in order to show at the examinations a good drawing\r\nand to get a good mark for it. Against the comrades who did so we had\r\nno grudge. On the contrary, we thought it quite right that those who\r\nhad no capacity for mathematics or no memory for geography, should\r\nimprove their total of marks by ordering from a draughtsman a drawing\r\nor a topographical map for which they would get ‘a full twelve.’ Only\r\nfor the first two pupils of the form it would not have been fair to\r\nresort to such means, while the remainder could do it with untroubled\r\nconsciences. But the teacher had no business to make drawings to order;\r\nand if he chose to act in this way, he ought to bear with resignation\r\nthe noise and the tricks of his pupils. These were our ethics. Instead\r\nof this, no lesson passed without his lodging complaints, and each time\r\nhe grew more arrogant.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we were moved to the fourth form, and felt ourselves\r\nnaturalized citizens of the corps, we decided to tighten the bridle\r\nupon him. ‘It is your own fault,’ our elder comrades told us, ‘that he\r\ntakes such airs with you; _we_ used to keep him in obedience.’ So we\r\ndecided to bring him into subjection.\r\n\r\nOne day, two excellent comrades of our form approached Ganz with\r\ncigarettes in their mouths, and asked him to oblige them with a light.\r\nOf course, that was only meant for a joke--no one ever thought of\r\nsmoking in the class-rooms--and, according to our rules of propriety,\r\nGanz had merely to send the two boys away; but he inscribed them in\r\nthe journal, and they were severely punished. That was the last drop.\r\nWe decided to give him a ‘benefit night.’ That meant that one day all\r\nthe form, provided with rulers borrowed from the upper forms, would\r\nstart an outrageous noise by striking the rulers against the tables,\r\nand send the teacher out of the class. However, the plot offered many\r\ndifficulties. We had in our form a lot of ‘goody’ boys who would\r\npromise to join in the demonstration, but at the last moment would grow\r\nnervous and draw back, and then the teacher would name the others.\r\nIn such enterprises unanimity is the first requisite, because the\r\npunishment, whatsoever it may be, is always lighter when it falls on\r\nthe whole class instead of on a few.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties were overcome with a truly Machiavellian craft. At\r\na given signal all were to turn their backs to Ganz, and then, with\r\nthe rulers laid in readiness on the desks of the next row, they would\r\nproduce the required noise. In this way the goody boys would not feel\r\nterrified at Ganz staring at them. But the signal? Whistling, as in\r\nrobbers’ tales, shouting, or even sneezing would not do: Ganz would\r\nbe capable of naming anyone of us as having whistled or sneezed. The\r\nsignal must be a silent one. One of us who drew nicely, would take his\r\ndrawing to show it to Ganz, and the moment he returned and took his\r\nseat--that was to be the time!\r\n\r\nAll went on admirably. Nesádoff took up his drawing, and Ganz corrected\r\nit in a few minutes, which seemed to us an eternity. He returned\r\nat last to his seat; he stopped for a moment, looking at us, he sat\r\ndown.... All the form turned suddenly on their seats, and the rulers\r\nrattled merrily within the desks, while some of us shouted amidst\r\nthe noise, ‘Ganz out! Down with him!’ The noise was deafening; all\r\nthe forms knew that Ganz had got his benefit night. He stood there,\r\nmurmuring something, and finally went out. An officer ran in--the\r\nnoise continued; then the sub-inspector dashed in, and after him the\r\ninspector. The noise stopped. Scolding began.\r\n\r\n‘The elder under arrest, at once!’ the inspector commanded; and I, who\r\nwas the first in the form, and consequently the elder, was marched to\r\nthe black cell. That spared me seeing what followed. The director came;\r\nGanz was asked to name the ringleaders, but he could name nobody. ‘They\r\nall turned their backs to me, and began the noise,’ was his reply.\r\nThereupon the form was taken downstairs, and although flogging had been\r\ncompletely abandoned in our school, this time the two who had been\r\nreported because they asked for a light were flogged with the birch\r\nrod, under the pretext that the benefit night was a revenge for their\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\nI learned this ten days later, when I was allowed to return to the\r\nclass. My name, which had been inscribed on the red board in the class,\r\nwas wiped off. To this I was indifferent; but I must confess that the\r\nten days in the cell, without books, seemed to me rather long, so that\r\nI composed (in horrible verses) a poem, in which the deeds of the\r\nfourth form were duly glorified.\r\n\r\nOf course our form became now the heroes of the school. For a month or\r\nso we had to tell and retell all about the affair to the other forms,\r\nand received congratulations for having managed it with such unanimity\r\nthat nobody was caught separately. And then came the Sundays--all the\r\nSundays down to Christmas--that the form had to remain at the school,\r\nnot being allowed to go home. Being all kept together, we managed to\r\nmake those Sundays very gay. The mammas of the goody boys brought them\r\nheaps of sweets; those who had some money spent it in buying mountains\r\nof pastry--substantial before dinner, and sweet after it--while in the\r\nevenings the friends from the other forms smuggled in quantities of\r\nfruit for the brave fourth form.\r\n\r\nGanz gave up inscribing anyone; but drawing was totally lost for us. No\r\none wanted to learn drawing from that mercenary man.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nMy brother Alexander was at that time at Moscow, in a corps of cadets,\r\nand we maintained a lively correspondence. As long as I stayed at home\r\nthis was impossible, because our father considered it his prerogative\r\nto read all letters addressed to our house, and he would soon have put\r\nan end to any but a commonplace correspondence. Now we were free to\r\ndiscuss in our letters whatever we liked. The only difficulty was to\r\nget money for stamps; but we soon learned to write in so small a hand\r\nthat we could convey an incredible amount of matter in each letter.\r\nAlexander, whose handwriting was beautiful, contrived to get four\r\nprinted pages on one single page of notepaper, and his microscopic\r\nlines were as legible as the best small type print. It is a pity that\r\nthese letters, which he kept as precious relics, have disappeared.\r\nThe State police, during one of their raids, robbed him even of these\r\ntreasures.\r\n\r\nOur first letters were mostly about the little details of my new\r\nsurroundings, but our correspondence soon took a more serious\r\ncharacter. My brother could not write about trifles. Even in society\r\nhe became animated only when some serious discussion was engaged in,\r\nand complained of feeling ‘a dull pain in the brain’--a physical pain,\r\nas he used to say--when he was with people who cared only for small\r\ntalk. He was very much in advance of me in his intellectual development\r\nand he urged me forward, raising new scientific and philosophical\r\nquestions one after another, and advising me what to read or to study.\r\nWhat a happiness it was for me to have such a brother!--a brother who,\r\nmoreover, loved me passionately. To him I owe the best part of my\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nSometimes he would advise me to read poetry, and would send me in\r\nhis letters quantities of verses and whole poems, which he wrote\r\nfrom memory. ‘Read poetry,’ he wrote: ‘poetry makes men better.’ How\r\noften, in my after life, I realized the truth of this remark of his!\r\nRead poetry: it makes men better! He himself was a poet, and had a\r\nwonderful facility for writing most musical verses; indeed, I think it\r\na great pity that he abandoned poetry. But the reaction against art,\r\nwhich arose among the Russian youth in the early sixties, and which\r\nTurguéneff has depicted in ‘Bazároff’ (_Fathers and Sons_), induced him\r\nto look upon his verses with contempt, and to plunge headlong into the\r\nnatural sciences. I must say, however, that my favourite poet was none\r\nof those whom his poetical gift, his musical ear, and his philosophical\r\nturn of mind made him like best. His favourite Russian poet was\r\nVenevítinoff, while mine was Nekrásoff, whose verses were very often\r\nunmusical, but appealed most to my heart by their sympathy for ‘the\r\ndown-trodden and ill-treated.’\r\n\r\n‘One must have a set purpose in his life,’ he wrote me once. ‘Without\r\nan aim, without a purpose, life is not life.’ And he advised me to get\r\na purpose in my life worth living for. I was too young then to find\r\none; but something undetermined, vague, ‘good’ altogether, already rose\r\nunder that appeal, even though I could not say what that ‘good’ would\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nOur father gave us very little spending money, and I never had any to\r\nbuy a single book; but if Alexander got a few roubles from some aunt,\r\nhe never spent a penny of it for pleasure, but bought a book and sent\r\nit to me. He objected, though, to indiscriminate reading. ‘One must\r\nhave some question,’ he wrote, ‘addressed to the book one is going to\r\nread.’ However, I did not then appreciate this remark, and cannot think\r\nnow without amazement of the number of books, often of a quite special\r\ncharacter, which I read, in all branches, but particularly in the\r\ndomain of history. I did not waste my time upon French novels, since\r\nAlexander, years before, had characterized them in one blunt sentence:\r\n‘They are stupid and full of bad language.’\r\n\r\nThe great questions concerning the conception we should form of the\r\nuniverse--our _Weltanschauung_, as the Germans say--were, of course,\r\nthe dominant subjects in our correspondence. In our childhood we had\r\nnever been religious. We were taken to church; but in a Russian church,\r\nin a small parish or in a village, the solemn attitude of the people\r\nis far more impressive than the Mass itself. Of all that I ever had\r\nheard in church only two things had impressed me: the twelve passages\r\nfrom the Gospels, relative to the sufferings of the Christ, which are\r\nread in Russia at the night service on the eve of Good Friday, and the\r\nshort prayer condemning the spirit of domination, which is recited\r\nduring the Great Lent, and is really beautiful by reason of its simple,\r\nunpretentious words and feeling, Púshkin has rendered it into Russian\r\nverse.\r\n\r\nLater on, at St. Petersburg, I went several times to a Roman Catholic\r\nchurch, but the theatrical character of the service and the absence of\r\nreal feeling in it shocked me, the more so when I saw there with what\r\nsimple faith some retired Polish soldier or a peasant woman would pray\r\nin a remote corner. I also went to a Protestant church; but coming out\r\nof it I caught myself murmuring Goethe’s words:---\r\n\r\n    But you will never link hearts together\r\n    Unless the linking springs from your own heart.\r\n\r\nAlexander, in the meantime, had embraced with his usual passion the\r\nLutheran faith. He had read Michelet’s book on Servetus, and had\r\nworked out for himself a religion on the lines of that great fighter.\r\nHe studied with enthusiasm the Augsburg declaration, which he copied\r\nout and sent me, and our letters now became full of discussions about\r\ngrace, and of texts from the apostles Paul and James. I followed my\r\nbrother, but theological discussions did not deeply interest me. Since\r\nI had recovered from the typhoid fever I had taken to quite different\r\nreading.\r\n\r\nOur sister Hélène, who was now married, was at St. Petersburg, and\r\nevery Saturday night I went to visit her. Her husband had a good\r\nlibrary, in which the French philosophers of the last century and the\r\nmodern French historians were well represented, and I plunged into\r\nthem. Such books were prohibited in Russia, and evidently could not\r\nbe taken to school; so I spent most of the night, every Saturday, in\r\nreading the works of the encyclopædists, the ‘Philosophical Dictionary’\r\nof Voltaire, the writings of the Stoics, especially Marcus Aurelius,\r\nand so on. The infinite immensity of the universe, the greatness of\r\nnature, its poetry, its ever throbbing life, impressed me more and\r\nmore; and that never-ceasing life and its harmonies gave me the ecstasy\r\nof admiration which the young soul thirsts for, while my favourite\r\npoets supplied me with an expression in words of that awakening love of\r\nmankind and faith in its progress which make the best part of youth and\r\nimpress man for a life.\r\n\r\nAlexander, by this time, had gradually come to a Kantian agnosticism,\r\nand the ‘relativity of perceptions,’ ‘perceptions in time and space,\r\nand time only,’ and so on, filled pages and pages in our letters, the\r\nwriting of which became more and more microscopical as the subjects\r\nunder discussion grew in importance. But neither then nor later on,\r\nwhen we used to spend hours and hours in discussing Kant’s philosophy,\r\ncould my brother convert me to become a disciple of the Königsberg\r\nphilosopher.\r\n\r\nNatural sciences--that is, mathematics, physics, and astronomy--were\r\nmy chief studies. In the year 1858, before Darwin had brought out\r\nhis immortal work, a professor of zoology at the Moscow University,\r\nRoulier, published three lectures on transformism, and my brother took\r\nup at once his ideas concerning the variability of species. He was not\r\nsatisfied, however, with approximate proofs only, and began to study\r\na number of special books on heredity and the like, communicating to\r\nme in his letters the main facts, as well as his ideas and his doubts.\r\nThe appearance of the ‘Origin of Species’ did not settle his doubts\r\non several special points, but only raised new questions and gave him\r\nthe impulse for further studies. We afterward discussed--and that\r\ndiscussion lasted for many years--various questions relative to the\r\norigin of variations, their chances of being transmitted and being\r\naccentuated; in short, those questions which have been raised quite\r\nlately in the Weismann-Spencer controversy, in Galton’s researches, and\r\nin the works of the modern Neo-Lamarckians. Owing to his philosophical\r\nand critical mind, Alexander had noticed at once the fundamental\r\nimportance of these questions for the theory of variability of species,\r\neven though they were so often overlooked then by many naturalists.\r\n\r\nI must also mention a temporary excursion into the domain of political\r\neconomy. In the years 1858 and 1859 everyone in Russia spoke of\r\npolitical economy; lectures on free trade and protective duties\r\nattracted crowds of people, and my brother, who was not yet absorbed\r\nby the variability of species, took a lively though temporary interest\r\nin economical matters, sending me for reading the ‘Political Economy’\r\nof Jean Baptiste Say. I read a few chapters only: tariffs and banking\r\noperations did not interest me in the least; but Alexander took up\r\nthese matters so passionately that he even wrote letters to our\r\nstepmother, trying to interest her in the intricacies of the customs\r\nduties. Later on, in Siberia, as we were re-reading some of the letters\r\nof that period, we laughed like children when we fell upon one of his\r\nepistles in which he complained of our stepmother’s incapacity to be\r\nmoved even by such burning questions, and raged against a greengrocer\r\nwhom he had caught in the street, and who, ‘would you believe it,’ he\r\nwrote with signs of exclamation, ‘although he was a tradesman, affected\r\na pig-headed indifference to tariff questions!’\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEvery summer about one-half of the pages were taken to a camp at\r\nPeterhof. The lower forms, however, were dispensed from joining the\r\ncamp, and I spent the first two summers at Nikólskoye. To leave the\r\nschool, to take the train to Moscow, and there to meet Alexander was\r\nsuch a happy prospect that I used to count the days that had to pass\r\ntill that glorious one should arrive. But on one occasion a great\r\ndisappointment awaited me at Moscow. Alexander had not passed his\r\nexaminations, and was left for another year in the same form. He was,\r\nin fact, too young to enter the special classes; but our father was\r\nvery angry with him, nevertheless, and would not permit us to see each\r\nother. I felt very sad. We were not children any more, and had so much\r\nto say to each other. I tried to obtain permission to go to our aunt\r\nSulíma, at whose house I might meet Alexander, but it was absolutely\r\nrefused. After our father remarried we were never allowed to see our\r\nmother’s relations.\r\n\r\nThat spring our Moscow house was full of guests. Every night the\r\nreception-rooms were flooded with lights, the band played, the\r\nconfectioner was busy making ices and pastry, and card-playing went on\r\nin the great hall till a late hour. I strolled aimlessly about in the\r\nbrilliantly illuminated rooms, and felt unhappy.\r\n\r\nOne night, after ten, a servant beckoned me, telling me to come out to\r\nthe entrance hall. I went. ‘Come to the coachmen’s house,’ the old\r\nmajor-domo Frol whispered to me. ‘Alexander Alexéievich is here.’\r\n\r\nI dashed across the yard, up the flight of steps leading to the\r\ncoachmen’s house, and into a wide, half-dark room, where, at the\r\nimmense dining-table of the servants, I saw Alexander.\r\n\r\n‘Sásha, dear, how did you come?’ and in a moment we rushed into each\r\nother’s arms, hugging each other and unable to speak from emotion.\r\n\r\n‘Hush, hush! they may overhear you,’ said the servants’ cook,\r\nPraskóvia, wiping away her tears with her apron. ‘Poor orphans! If your\r\nmother were only alive----’\r\n\r\nOld Frol stood, his head deeply bent, his eyes also twinkling.\r\n\r\n‘Look here, Pétya, not a word to anyone; to no one,’ he said, while\r\nPraskóvia placed on the table an earthenware jar full of porridge for\r\nAlexander.\r\n\r\nHe, glowing with health, in his cadet uniform, already had begun to\r\ntalk about all sorts of matters, while he rapidly emptied the porridge\r\npot. I could hardly make him tell me how he came there at such a late\r\nhour. We lived then near the Smolénsky boulevard, within a stone’s\r\nthrow of the house where our mother died, and the corps of cadets was\r\nat the opposite outskirts of Moscow, full five miles away.\r\n\r\nHe had made a doll out of bedclothes, and had put it in his bed, under\r\nthe blankets; then he went to the tower, descended from a window, came\r\nout unnoticed, and walked the whole distance.\r\n\r\n‘Were you not afraid at night in the deserted fields round your corps?’\r\nI asked.\r\n\r\n‘What had I to fear? Only lots of dogs were upon me; I had teased them\r\nmyself. To-morrow I shall take my sword with me.’\r\n\r\nThe coachmen and other servants came in and out; they sighed as\r\nthey looked at us, and took seats at a distance, along the walls,\r\nexchanging words in a subdued tone so as not to disturb us; while we\r\ntwo, in each other’s arms, sat there till midnight, talking about\r\nnebulæ and Laplace’s hypothesis, the structure of matter, the struggles\r\nof the papacy under Boniface VIII. with the imperial power, and so on.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time one of the servants would hurriedly run in, saying,\r\n‘Pétinka, go and show thyself in the hall; they may ask for thee.’\r\n\r\nI implored Sásha not to come next night; but he came, nevertheless--not\r\nwithout having had a scrimmage with the dogs, against whom he had taken\r\nhis sword. I responded with feverish haste, when, earlier than the\r\nday before, I was called once more to the coachmen’s house. Alexander\r\nhad made part of the journey in a cab. The previous night, one of the\r\nservants had brought him what he had got from the card-players and\r\nasked him to take it. He took some small coin to hire a cab, and so he\r\ncame earlier than on his first visit.\r\n\r\nHe intended to come next night, too, but for some reason it would\r\nhave been dangerous for the servants, and we decided to part till the\r\nautumn. A short ‘official’ note made me understand next day that his\r\nnocturnal escapades had passed unnoticed. How terrible would have been\r\nthe punishment, if they had been discovered. It is awful to think of\r\nit: flogging before the corps till he was carried away unconscious on\r\na sheet, and then degradation to a soldiers’ sons’ battalion--anything\r\nwas possible, in those times.\r\n\r\nWhat our servants would have suffered for hiding us, if information\r\nof the affair had reached our father’s ears, would have been equally\r\nterrible; but they knew how to keep secrets and not to betray one\r\nanother. They all knew of the visits of Alexander, but none of them\r\nwhispered a word to anyone of the family. They and I were the only ones\r\nin the house who ever knew anything about it.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThat same year I made my first start as an explorer of popular life,\r\nand this little work brought me one step nearer to our peasants, making\r\nme see them under a new light; it also helped me later on a great deal\r\nin Siberia.\r\n\r\nEvery year in July, on the day of ‘the Holy Virgin of Kazán’ which was\r\nthe fête of our church, a pretty large fair was held in Nikólskoye.\r\nTradesmen came from the neighbouring towns, and many thousands of\r\npeasants flocked from thirty miles round to our village, which for a\r\ncouple of days had a most animated aspect. A remarkable description of\r\nthe village fairs of South Russia had just been published that year by\r\nthe Slavophile Aksákoff, and my brother, who was then at the height of\r\nhis politico-economical enthusiasm, advised me to make a statistical\r\ndescription of our fair, and to determine the return of goods brought\r\nin and sold. I followed his advice, and to my great amazement I really\r\nsucceeded: my estimate of returns, so far as I can judge now, was not\r\nmore unreliable than many similar estimates in books of statistics.\r\n\r\nOur fair lasted only a little more than twenty-four hours. On the eve\r\nof the fête, the great open space given to it was full of life and\r\nanimation. Long rows of stalls, to be used for the sale of cottons,\r\nribbons, and all sorts of peasant women’s attire, were hurriedly built.\r\nThe restaurant, a substantial stone building, was furnished with\r\ntables, chairs and benches, and its floor was strewn over with bright\r\nyellow sand. Three wine-shops were erected in three different places,\r\nand freshly cut brooms, planted on high poles, rose high in the air\r\nto attract the peasants from a distance. Rows and rows of light shops\r\nfor the sale of crockery, boots, stoneware, ginger-bread, and all\r\nsorts of small things, rose as if by a magic wand; while in a special\r\ncorner holes were dug in the ground to receive immense cauldrons in\r\nwhich bushels of millet and sarrasin and whole sheep were boiled,\r\nfor supplying the thousands of visitors with hot _schi_ and _kásha_\r\n(soup and porridge). In the afternoon, the four roads leading to the\r\nfair were blocked by hundreds of peasant carts, and cattle, corn,\r\ncasks filled with tar, and heaps of pottery were exhibited along the\r\nroadsides.\r\n\r\nThe night service on the eve of the fête was performed in our church\r\nwith great solemnity. Half a dozen priests and deacons from the\r\nneighbouring villages took part in it, and their chanters, reinforced\r\nby young tradespeople, sang in the choir with such ritornellos as could\r\nonly be heard at the bishop’s in Kalúga. The church was crowded; all\r\nprayed fervently. The tradespeople vied with each other in the number\r\nand sizes of the wax candles which they lighted before the ikons, as\r\nofferings to the local saints for the success of their trade; and\r\nthe crowd being so thick as not to allow the last comers to reach\r\nthe altar, candles of all sizes--thick and thin, white and yellow,\r\naccording to the offerer’s wealth--were transmitted from the back of\r\nthe church through the crowd, with whispers: ‘To the Holy Virgin of\r\nKazán, our Protector,’ ‘To Nicholas the Favourite,’ ‘To Frol and Laur’\r\n(the horse saints--that was from those who had horses to sell), or\r\nsimply ‘the Saints’ without a further specification.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the night service was over, the ‘fore-fair’ began,\r\nand I had now to plunge headlong into my work of asking hundreds of\r\npeople what was the value of the goods they had brought in. To my great\r\nastonishment my task went on admirably. Of course, I was myself asked\r\nquestions: ‘Why do you do this?’ ‘Is it not for the old prince, who\r\nintends increasing the market dues?’ But the assurance that the ‘old\r\nprince’ knew and would know nothing of it (he would have found it a\r\ndisgraceful occupation) settled all doubts at once. I soon caught the\r\nproper way of asking questions, and after I had taken half a dozen cups\r\nof tea in the restaurant with some tradespeople (oh, horror, if my\r\nfather had learned that!), all went on very well. Vasíly Ivánoff, the\r\nelder of Nikólskoye, a beautiful young peasant with a fine intelligent\r\nface and a silky fair beard, took an interest in my work. ‘Well, if\r\nthou wantest it for thy learning, get at it; thou wilt tell us later on\r\nwhat thou hast found out’--was his conclusion, and he told some of the\r\npeople that it was ‘all right.’ Everyone knew him for miles round, and\r\nthe word passed round the fair that no harm would ensue to the peasants\r\nby giving me the information.\r\n\r\nIn short, the ‘imports’ were determined very nicely. But next day,\r\nthe ‘sales’ offered certain difficulties, chiefly with the dry goods’\r\nmerchants, who did not themselves yet know how much they had sold. On\r\nthe day of the fête the young peasant women simply stormed the shops,\r\neach of them having sold some linen of her own making and now buying\r\nsome cotton print for a dress and a bright kerchief for herself, a\r\ncoloured handkerchief for her husband, perhaps some neck lace, a ribbon\r\nor two, and a number of small gifts to grandmother, grandfather, and\r\nthe children who had remained at home. As to the peasants who sold\r\ncrockery, or ginger-cakes, or cattle and hemp, they at once determined\r\ntheir sales, especially the old women. ‘Good sale, grandmother?’ I\r\nwould ask. ‘No need to complain, my son. Why should I anger God? Nearly\r\nall is sold.’ And out of their small items the tens of thousand roubles\r\ngrew in my note-book. One point only remained unsettled. A wide space\r\nwas given up to many hundreds of peasant women who stood in the burning\r\nsun, each with her piece of handwoven linen, sometimes exquisitely\r\nfine, which she had brought for sale--scores of buyers, with gypsy\r\nfaces and shark-like looks, moving about in the crowd and buying. Only\r\nrough estimates of these sales could evidently be made.\r\n\r\nI made no reflections at that time about this new experience of mine; I\r\nwas simply happy to see that it was not a failure. But the serious good\r\nsense and sound judgment of the Russian peasants which I witnessed\r\nduring this couple of days, left upon me a lasting impression. Later\r\non, when we were making socialist propaganda among the peasants,\r\nI could not but wonder why some of my friends, who had received a\r\nseemingly far more democratic education than myself, did not know how\r\nto talk to the peasants or to the factory workers from the country.\r\nThey tried to imitate the ‘peasants’ talk,’ by introducing into it\r\nlots of so-called ‘popular phrases,’ and only rendered it the more\r\nincomprehensible.\r\n\r\nNothing of this sort is needed, either in talking to peasants or in\r\nwriting for them. The Great Russian peasant perfectly well understands\r\nthe educated man’s talk, provided that it is not stuffed with words\r\ntaken from foreign languages. What the peasant does not understand is\r\nabstract notions when they are not illustrated by concrete examples.\r\nBut when you speak to the Russian peasant plainly, and start from\r\nconcrete facts--and the same is true with regard to village-folk of\r\nall nationalities--my experience is that there is no generalization\r\nfrom the whole world of science, social or natural, which could not be\r\nconveyed to the averagely intelligent man if you yourself understand\r\nit concretely. The chief difference between the educated and the\r\nuneducated man is, I should say, in the latter not being able to follow\r\na chain of conclusions. He grasps the first of them, and maybe the\r\nsecond, but he gets tired at the third, if he does not see what you\r\nare driving at. But, how often do we meet with the same difficulty in\r\neducated people!\r\n\r\nOne more impression I gathered from that work of my boyhood--an\r\nimpression which I formulated but later on, and which will probably\r\nastonish many a reader. It is the spirit of equality which is highly\r\ndeveloped in the Russian peasant and, in fact, in the rural population\r\neverywhere. The Russian peasant is capable of much servile obedience\r\nto the landlord or to the police officer; he will bend before their\r\nwill in a servile manner; but he does not consider them superior men,\r\nand if the next moment that same landlord or officer talks to the same\r\npeasant about hay or ducks, the latter will converse with them as an\r\nequal to an equal. I never saw in a Russian peasant that servility,\r\ngrown to be a second nature, with which a small functionary talks to\r\na highly placed one, or a valet to his master. The peasant much too\r\neasily submits to force, but he does not worship it.\r\n\r\nI returned that summer from Nikólskoye to Moscow in a new fashion.\r\nThere being then no railway between Kalúga and Moscow, a man, Buck\r\nby name, kept some sort of carriages running between the two towns.\r\nOur people never thought of travelling in such a way: they had their\r\nown horses and conveyances; but when my father, in order to save my\r\nstepmother a double journey, offered me, half in joke, to travel alone\r\nin that way, I accepted his offer with delight.\r\n\r\nAn old and very stout tradesman’s wife and myself on the back seats,\r\nand a small tradesman or artisan on the front seat, were the only\r\noccupants of the carriage. I found the journey very pleasant--first\r\nof all because I travelled by myself (I was not yet sixteen), and\r\nnext because the old lady, who had brought with her for a three days’\r\njourney a colossal hamper full of provisions, treated me to all sorts\r\nof home-made delicacies. All the surroundings during that journey were\r\ndelightful. One evening especially is still vivid in my memory. We\r\ncame at night to one of the great villages and stopped at some inn.\r\nThe old lady ordered a samovár for herself, while I went out in the\r\nstreet, walking about anywhere. A small ‘white inn’ at which only food\r\nis served, but no drinks, attracted my attention and I went in. Numbers\r\nof peasants sat round the small tables, covered with white napkins, and\r\nenjoyed their tea. I did the same.\r\n\r\nAll was so new for me in these surroundings. It was a village of\r\n‘Crown peasants’--that is, peasants who had not been serfs and enjoyed\r\na relative well-being, probably owing to the weaving of linen which\r\nthey carried on as a home industry. Slow, serious conversations, with\r\noccasional laughter, were going on at those tables, and after the usual\r\nintroductory questions, I soon found myself engaged in a conversation\r\nwith a dozen peasants about the crops in our neighbourhood, and\r\nanswering all sorts of questions. They wanted to know all about St.\r\nPetersburg, and most of all about the rumours concerning the coming\r\nabolition of serfdom. And a feeling of simplicity and of the natural\r\nrelations of equality, as well as of hearty good-will, which I always\r\nfelt afterwards when among peasants or in their houses, took possession\r\nof me at that inn. Nothing extraordinary happened that night, so that\r\nI even ask myself if the incident is worth mentioning at all; and yet\r\nthat warm, dark night in the village, that small inn, that talk with\r\nthe peasants, and the keen interest they took in hundreds of things\r\nlying far beyond their habitual surroundings, have made ever since a\r\npoor ‘white inn’ more attractive to me than the best restaurant in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nStormy times came now in the life of our corps. When Girardot was\r\ndismissed, his place was taken by one of our officers, Captain B----.\r\nHe was rather good-natured than otherwise, but he had got into his head\r\nthat he was not treated by us with due reverence, corresponding to\r\nthe high position which he now occupied, and he tried to enforce upon\r\nus more respect and awe toward himself. He began by quarrelling about\r\nall sorts of petty things with the upper form, and--what was still\r\nworse--he attempted to destroy our ‘liberties,’ the origin of which was\r\nlost in the darkness of time, and which, insignificant in themselves,\r\nwere perhaps on that same account only the dearer to us.\r\n\r\nThe result of it was that the school broke for several days into an\r\nopen revolt, which ended in wholesale punishment, and the exclusion\r\nfrom the corps of two of our favourite pages de chambre.\r\n\r\nThen, the same captain began to intrude in the class-rooms, where we\r\nused to spend one hour in the morning in preparing our lessons before\r\nthe classes began. We were considered to be there under our teaching\r\nstaff, and were happy to have nothing to do with our military chiefs.\r\nWe resented that intrusion very much, and one day I loudly expressed\r\nour discontent, saying to the captain that this was the place of the\r\ninspector of the classes, not his. I spent weeks under arrest for that\r\nfrankness, and perhaps should have been excluded from the school, were\r\nit not that the inspector of the classes, his assistant, and even our\r\nold director, judged that after all I had only expressed aloud what\r\nthey all used to say to themselves.\r\n\r\nNo sooner all these troubles were over, than the death of the\r\nDowager-Empress--the widow of Nicholas I.--brought a new interruption\r\nin our work.\r\n\r\nThe burial of crowned heads is always so arranged as to produce a\r\ndeep impression on the crowds, and it must be owned that this object\r\nis attained. The body of the empress was brought from Tsárkoye Seló,\r\nwhere she died, to St. Petersburg, and here, followed by the imperial\r\nfamily, all the high dignitaries of the state, and scores of thousands\r\nof functionaries and corporations, and preceded by hundreds of clergy\r\nand choirs, it was taken from the railway station through the main\r\nthoroughfares to the fortress, where it had to lie in state for\r\nseveral weeks. A hundred thousand men of the Guard were placed along\r\nthe streets, and thousands of people, dressed in the most gorgeous\r\nuniforms, preceded, accompanied, and followed the hearse in a solemn\r\nprocession. Litanies were sung at every important crossing of the\r\nstreets, and here the ringing of the bells on the church towers, the\r\nvoices of vast choirs, and the sounds of the military bands united in\r\nthe most impressive way, so as to make people believe that the immense\r\ncrowds really mourned the loss of the empress.\r\n\r\nAs long as the body lay in state in the cathedral of the fortress, the\r\npages, among others, had to keep the watch round it, night and day.\r\nThree pages de chambre and three maids of honour always stood close by\r\nthe coffin, placed on a high pedestal, while some twenty pages were\r\nstationed on the platform upon which litanies were sung twice every\r\nday, in the presence of the emperor and all his family. Consequently,\r\nevery week nearly one-half of the corps was taken in turns to the\r\nfortress, to lodge there. We were relieved every two hours, and in the\r\ndaytime our service was not difficult; but when we had to rise in the\r\nnight, to dress in our court uniforms, and then to walk through the\r\ndark and gloomy inner courts of the fortress to the cathedral, to the\r\nsound of the gloomy chime of the fortress bells, a cold shiver seized\r\nme at the thought of the prisoners who were immured somewhere in this\r\nRussian Bastille. ‘Who knows,’ thought I, ‘whether in my turn I shall\r\nnot also have to join them one day or other?’\r\n\r\nThe burial did not pass without an accident which might have had\r\nserious consequences. An immense canopy had been erected under the\r\ndome of the cathedral over the coffin. A huge gilded crown rose above\r\nit, and from this crown an immense purple mantle lined with ermine\r\nhung towards the four thick pilasters which support the dome of the\r\ncathedral. It was impressive, but we boys soon made out that the crown\r\nwas made of gilded cardboard and wood, the mantle was of velvet only in\r\nits lower part, while higher up it was red cotton, and that the ermine\r\nlining was simply cotton flannelette or swansdown to which black tails\r\nof squirrels had been sewn, while the escutcheons which represented the\r\narms of Russia, veiled with black crêpe, were simple cardboard. But\r\nthe crowds which were allowed at certain hours of the night to pass by\r\nthe coffin, and to kiss in a hurry the gold brocade which covered it,\r\nsurely had no time to closely examine the flannelette ermine or the\r\ncardboard escutcheons, and the desired theatrical effect was obtained\r\neven by such cheap means.\r\n\r\nWhen a litany is sung in Russia all the people present hold lighted wax\r\ncandles, which have to be put out after certain prayers have been read.\r\nThe Imperial family also held such candles, and one day the young son\r\nof the grand duke Constantine, seeing that the others put out their\r\ncandles by turning them upside down, did the same. The black gauze\r\nwhich hung behind him from an escutcheon took fire, and in a second the\r\nescutcheon and the cotton stuff were ablaze. An immense tongue of fire\r\nran up the heavy folds of the supposed ermine mantle.\r\n\r\nThe service was stopped. All looks were directed with terror towards\r\nthe tongue of fire, which went higher and higher towards the cardboard\r\ncrown and the woodwork which supported the whole structure. Bits of\r\nburning stuff began to fall down, threatening to set fire to the black\r\ngauze veils of the ladies present.\r\n\r\nAlexander II. lost his presence of mind for a couple of seconds only,\r\nbut he recovered immediately and said in a composed voice: ‘The coffin\r\nmust be taken!’ The pages de chambre at once covered it with the thick\r\ngold brocade, and we all advanced to lift the heavy coffin; but in the\r\nmeantime the big tongue of flame had broken into a number of smaller\r\nones, which now slowly devoured only the fluffy outside of the cotton\r\nstuff and, meeting more and more dust and soot in the upper part of the\r\nstructure, gradually died out in the folds.\r\n\r\nI cannot say what I looked most at: the creeping fire or the stately\r\nslender figures of the three ladies who stood by the coffin, the long\r\ntrains of their black dresses spreading over the steps which led to\r\nthe upper platform, and their black lace veils hanging down their\r\nshoulders. None of them had made the slightest movement: they stood\r\nlike three beautiful carved images. Only in the dark eyes of one of\r\nthem, Mdlle. Gamaléya, tears glittered like pearls. She was a daughter\r\nof South Russia, and was the only really handsome lady amongst the\r\nmaids of honour at the Court.\r\n\r\nAt the corps, in the meantime, everything was upside down. The classes\r\nwere interrupted; those of us who returned from the fortress were\r\nlodged in temporary quarters, and, having nothing to do, spent the\r\nwhole day in all sorts of frolics. In one of them we managed to open a\r\ncupboard which stood in the room and contained a splendid collection\r\nof models of all kinds of animals for the teaching of natural history.\r\nThat was its official purpose; but it was never even so much as shown\r\nto us, and now that we got hold of it we utilized it in our own way.\r\nWith the human skull which made part of the collection we made a\r\nghostly figure wherewith to frighten at night other comrades and the\r\nofficers. As to the animals, we placed them in the most unappropriate\r\npositions and groups: monkeys were seen riding on lions, sheep were\r\nplaying with leopards, the giraffe danced with the elephant, and so on.\r\nThe worst was that a few days later one of the Prussian princes who\r\nhad come to assist at the burial ceremony (it was the one, I think,\r\nwho became later on the Emperor Frederick) visited our school, and\r\nwas shown all that concerned our education. Our director did not fail\r\nto boast of the excellent educational appliances which we had at the\r\nschool, and brought him to that same unfortunate cupboard.... When\r\nthe German prince caught a glimpse of our zoological classification,\r\nhe drew a long face and quickly turned away. Our old director looked\r\nhorrified; he had lost the power of speech, and only pointed repeatedly\r\nwith his hand at some star-fishes which were placed in glass boxes on\r\nthe walls by the sides of the cupboard. The suite of the prince tried\r\nto look as if they had noticed nothing, and only threw rapid glimpses\r\nat the cause of so much disturbance, while we wicked boys made all\r\nsorts of faces in order not to burst with laughter.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nThe school years of a Russian youth are so very different from what\r\nthey are in West European schools that I must dwell upon my school\r\nlife. Russian youths, as a rule, while they are yet at a lyceum or\r\nin a military school, already take an interest in a wide circle of\r\nsocial, political, and philosophical matters. It is true that the corps\r\nof pages was, of all schools, the least congenial medium for such a\r\ndevelopment; but in those years of general revival, broader ideas\r\npenetrated even into our midst and carried some of us away, without,\r\nhowever, preventing us from taking a very lively part in ‘benefit\r\nnights’ and all sorts of frolics.\r\n\r\nWhile I was in the fourth form I took an interest in history, and\r\nwith the aid of notes made during the lessons--I knew that university\r\nstudents do it that way--and helping myself with reading, I wrote\r\nquite a course of early mediæval history for my own use. Next year the\r\nstruggle between Pope Boniface VIII. and the Imperial power attracted\r\nmy special attention, and now it became my ambition to gain admission\r\nto the Imperial library as a reader, in order thoroughly to study that\r\ngreat struggle. This was contrary to the rules of the library, pupils\r\nof secondary schools not being admitted; our good Herr Becker, however,\r\nsmoothed the way out of the difficulty, and I was allowed one day to\r\nenter the sanctuary and to take a seat at one of the readers’ small\r\ntables, on one of the red velvet sofas with which the reading-room was\r\nthen furnished.\r\n\r\nFrom various text-books and some books from our own library, I soon\r\ngot to the sources. Knowing no Latin, I discovered nevertheless\r\na rich supply of original sources in Old Teutonic and Old French,\r\nand found an immense æsthetic enjoyment in the quaint structure and\r\nexpressiveness of the latter in the Chronicles. Quite a new structure\r\nof society and quite a world of complicated relations opened before me;\r\nand from that time I learned to value far more the original sources of\r\nhistory than works in which it is generalized in accordance with modern\r\nviews--the prejudices of modern politics, or even mere current formulæ\r\nbeing substituted for the real life of the period. Nothing gives more\r\nimpetus to one’s intellectual development than some sort of independent\r\nresearch, and these studies of mine immensely helped me afterwards.\r\n\r\nUnhappily, I had to abandon them when we reached the second form (the\r\nlast but one). The pages had to study during the last two years nearly\r\nall that was taught in other military schools in three ‘special’ forms,\r\nand we had an immense amount of work to do for the school. Natural\r\nsciences, mathematics, and military sciences necessarily relegated\r\nhistory to the background.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the second form we began seriously to study physics. We had an\r\nexcellent teacher--a very intelligent man with a sarcastic turn of\r\nmind, who hated learning from memory, and managed to make us _think_\r\ninstead of merely learning facts. He was a good mathematician, and\r\ntaught us physics on a mathematical basis, admirably explaining at\r\nthe same time the leading ideas of physical research and physical\r\napparatus. Some of his questions were so original and his explanations\r\nso good that they have engraved themselves for ever on my memory.\r\n\r\nOur text-book of physics was pretty good (most text-books for the\r\nmilitary schools had been written by the best men at the time), but\r\nit was rather old, and our teacher, who followed his own system in\r\nteaching, began to prepare a short summary of his lessons--a sort of\r\n_aide-mémoire_--for the use of our form. However, after a few weeks it\r\nso happened that the task of writing this summary fell upon me, and our\r\nteacher, acting as a true pedagogist, trusted it entirely to me, only\r\nreading the proofs. When we came to the chapters of heat, electricity,\r\nand magnetism, they had to be written entirely anew, and this I did,\r\nthus preparing a nearly complete text-book of physics, which was\r\nprinted for the use of the school.\r\n\r\nIn the second form we also began to study chemistry, and we also\r\nhad a first-rate teacher--a passionate lover of the subject who had\r\nhimself made valuable original researches. The years 1859-61 were\r\nyears of a universal revival of taste in the exact sciences: Grove,\r\nClausius, Joule, and Séguin showed that heat and all physical forces\r\nare but divers modes of motion; Helmholtz began about that time his\r\nepoch-making researches in sound; and Tyndall, in his popular lectures,\r\nmade one touch, so to say, the very atoms and molecules. Gerhardt and\r\nAvogadro introduced the theory of substitutions, and Mendeléoff, Lothar\r\nMeyer, and Newlands discovered the periodical law of elements; Darwin,\r\nwith his ‘Origin of Species,’ revolutionized all biological sciences;\r\nwhile Karl Vogt and Moleschott, following Claude Bernard, laid the\r\nfoundations of true psychology in physiology. It was a great time of\r\nscientific revival, and the current which directed men’s minds towards\r\nnatural science was irresistible. Numbers of excellent books were\r\npublished at that time in Russian translations, and I soon understood\r\nthat whatever one’s subsequent studies might be, a thorough knowledge\r\nof the natural sciences and familiarity with their methods must lie at\r\nthe foundation.\r\n\r\nFive or six of us joined together to get some sort of laboratory for\r\nourselves. With the elementary apparatus recommended for beginners in\r\nStöckhardt’s excellent text-book we started our laboratory in a small\r\nbedroom of two of our comrades, the brothers Zasétsky. Their father,\r\nan old retired admiral, was delighted to see his sons engaged in so\r\nuseful a pursuit, and did not object to our coming together on Sundays\r\nand during the holidays in that room by the side of his own study. With\r\nStöckhardt’s book as a guide, we systematically made all experiments.\r\nI must say that once we nearly set the house on fire, and that more\r\nthan once we poisoned all the rooms with chlorine and similar stuffs.\r\nBut the old admiral, when we related the adventure at dinner time, took\r\nit very nicely, and told us how he and his comrades also nearly set a\r\nhouse on fire in the far less useful pursuit of punch making; while the\r\nmother only said, amidst her paroxysms of coughing: ‘Of course, if it\r\n_is_ necessary for your learning to handle such nasty smelling things,\r\nthen there’s nothing to be done!’\r\n\r\nAfter dinner she usually took her seat at the piano, and till late at\r\nnight we would go on singing duos, trios, and choruses from the operas.\r\nOr else we would take the score of some Italian or Russian opera and\r\ngo through it from the beginning to the end, recitatives and all--the\r\nmother and her daughter taking the parts of the _prime donne_, while we\r\nmanaged more or rather less successfully to maintain all other parts.\r\nChemistry and music thus went hand in hand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHigher mathematics also absorbed a great deal of my time. Four or\r\nfive of us had already decided that we should not enter a regiment of\r\nthe Guards, where all our time would be given to military drill and\r\nparades, and we intended to enter, after promotion, one of the military\r\nacademies--artillery or engineering. In order to do so we had to\r\nprepare in higher geometry, the differential and the beginnings of the\r\nintegral calculus, and we took private lessons for that purpose. At the\r\nsame time, elementary astronomy being taught to us under the name of\r\nmathematical geography, I plunged into astronomical reading, especially\r\nduring the last year of my stay at school. The never-ceasing life of\r\nthe universe, which I conceived as _life_ and evolution, became for me\r\nan inexhaustible source of higher poetical thought, and gradually the\r\nsense of man’s oneness with Nature, both animate and inanimate--the\r\npoetry of Nature--became the philosophy of my life.\r\n\r\nIf the teaching in our school were only limited to the subjects I have\r\nmentioned, our time would already be pretty well occupied. But we also\r\nhad to study in the domain of humanitarian science, history, law (that\r\nis, the main outlines of the Russian Code), and political economy in\r\nits essential leading principles, including a course of comparative\r\nstatistics; and we had to master formidable courses of military\r\nsciences: tactics, military history (the campaigns of 1812 and 1815 in\r\nall their details), artillery, and field fortification. Looking now\r\nback upon this education I think that apart from the subjects relative\r\nto military warfare, which might have been advantageously substituted\r\nby more detailed studies in the exact sciences, the variety of subjects\r\nwhich we were taught was not beyond the capacities of the average\r\nyouth. Owing to a pretty good knowledge of elementary mathematics\r\nand physics, which we gained in the lower forms, nearly all of us\r\nmanaged to master all these subjects. Some subjects were neglected by\r\nmost of us, especially law, as also modern history, for which we had\r\nunfortunately an old wreck of a master who was only kept at his post in\r\norder to give him his full old age pension. Moreover, some latitude was\r\ngiven to us in the choice of the subjects we liked best, and, while we\r\nunderwent severe examinations in these chosen subjects, we were treated\r\nrather leniently in the remainder. But the chief cause of the relative\r\nsuccess which was obtained in the school was that the teaching was\r\nrendered as concrete as possible. As soon as we had learned elementary\r\ngeometry on paper, we re-learned it in the field with poles and the\r\nsurveyor’s chain, and next with the astrolabe, the compass, and the\r\nsurveyor’s table. After such a concrete training, elementary astronomy\r\noffered no difficulties, while the surveys themselves were an endless\r\nsource of enjoyment.\r\n\r\nThe same system of concrete teaching was applied to fortification. In\r\nthe winter we solved such problems as, for instance, the following:\r\n‘Having a thousand men and a fortnight at your disposal, build the\r\nstrongest fortification you can build to protect that bridge for a\r\nretreating army;’ and we hotly discussed our schemes with the teacher\r\nwhen he criticized them. In the summer we applied that knowledge in the\r\nfield. To these practical and concrete exercises I entirely attribute\r\nthe easiness with which most of us mastered such a variety of subjects\r\nat the age of seventeen and eighteen.\r\n\r\nWith all that, we had plenty of time for amusement. Our best time was\r\nwhen the examinations were over, and we had three or four weeks quite\r\nfree before going to camp; or when we returned from the camp, and had\r\nanother three weeks free before the beginning of the lessons. The\r\nfew of us who remained then in the school were allowed, during the\r\nvacations, to go out just as we liked, always finding bed and food\r\nat the school. I worked then in the library, or visited the picture\r\ngalleries of the Hermitage, studying one by one all the best pictures\r\nof each school separately; or I went to the different Crown factories\r\nand works of playing cards, cottons, iron, china and glass, which\r\nare open to the public. Or we went out rowing on the Nevá, spending\r\nthe whole night on the river, sometimes in the Gulf of Finland with\r\nfishermen--a melancholy northern night, during which the morning dawn\r\nmeets the afterglow of the setting sun, and a book can be read in the\r\nopen air at midnight. For all this we found plenty of time.\r\n\r\nSince those visits to the factories I took a liking to strong and\r\nperfect machinery. Seeing how a gigantic paw, coming out of a shanty,\r\ngrasps a log floating in the Nevá, pulls it inside, and puts it under\r\nthe saws which cut it into boards; or how a huge red-hot iron bar is\r\ntransformed into a rail after it has passed between two cylinders, I\r\nunderstood the poetry of machinery. In our present factories, machinery\r\nwork is killing for the worker, because he becomes a lifelong servant\r\nto a given machine and never is anything else. But this is a matter\r\nof bad organization, and has nothing to do with the machine itself.\r\nOver-work and lifelong monotony are equally bad whether the work is\r\ndone with the hand, with plain tools, or with a machine. But, apart\r\nfrom these, I fully understand the pleasure that man can derive\r\nfrom the consciousness of the might of his machine, the intelligent\r\ncharacter of its work, the gracefulness of its movements, and the\r\ncorrectness of what it is doing, and I think that William Morris’s\r\nhatred of machines only proved that the conception of the machine’s\r\npower and gracefulness was missing in his great poetical genius.\r\n\r\nMusic also played a very great part in my development. From it I\r\nborrowed even greater joys and enthusiasm than from poetry. The Russian\r\nopera hardly existed in those times; but the Italian opera, which had\r\na number of first-rate stars in it, was the most popular institution\r\nat St. Petersburg. When the _prima donna_ Bósio fell ill, thousands\r\nof people, chiefly of the youth, stood till late at night at the door\r\nof her hotel to get news of her. She was not beautiful, but was so\r\nmuch so when she sang that young men madly in love with her could be\r\ncounted by the hundred; and when she died she had a burial which no\r\none before had ever had at St. Petersburg. ‘All Petersburg’ was then\r\ndivided into two camps: the admirers of the Italian opera and those of\r\nthe French stage, which already then was showing in germ the putrid\r\nOffenbachian current which a few years later infected all Europe. Our\r\nform was also divided, half and half, between these two currents, and\r\nI belonged to the former. We were not permitted to go to the pit or to\r\nthe balcony, while all the boxes in the Italian opera were always taken\r\nmonths in advance by subscription, and even transmitted in certain\r\nfamilies as an hereditary possession. But we gained admission, on\r\nSaturday nights, to the passages in the uppermost gallery, and had to\r\nstand there on our legs in a Turkish bath atmosphere; while to conceal\r\nour showy uniforms we used to wear, in that Turkish bath, our black\r\novercoats, lined with wadding and with a fur collar, tightly buttoned.\r\nIt is a wonder that none of us got pneumonia in this way, especially\r\nas we came out overheated with the ovations which we used to make to\r\nour favourite singers, and stood afterwards at the stage door to catch\r\nonce more a glimpse of our favourites, and to cheer them. The Italian\r\nopera in those years was in some strange way intimately connected with\r\nthe Radical movement, and the revolutionary recitatives in ‘Wilhelm\r\nTell’ and ‘The Puritans’ were always met with stormy applause and\r\nvociferations which went straight to the heart of Alexander II.;\r\nwhile in the sixth story galleries, in the smoking-room of the opera,\r\nand at the stage door the best part of the St. Petersburg youth came\r\ntogether in a common idealist worship of a noble art. All this may seem\r\nchildish; but many higher ideas and pure inspirations were kindled in\r\nus by this worship of our favourite artists.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nEvery summer we went out camping at Peterhóf, with the other military\r\nschools of the St. Petersburg district. All things considered, our life\r\nthere was very pleasant, and certainly was excellent for our health: we\r\nslept in spacious tents, we bathed in the sea, and spent all the six\r\nweeks in open-air exercise.\r\n\r\nIn military schools the main purpose of camp life was evidently\r\nmilitary drill, which we all disliked very much, but the dulness of\r\nwhich was occasionally relieved by making us take part in manœuvres.\r\nOne night, as we were already going to bed, Alexander II. aroused the\r\ncamp by having the alert sounded. In a few minutes all the camp was\r\nalive--several thousand boys gathering round their colours, and the\r\nguns of the artillery school booming in the stillness of the night.\r\nAll military Peterhóf was galloping to our camp, but, owing to some\r\nmisunderstanding, the emperor remained on foot. Orderlies were sent\r\nin all directions to get a horse for him, but there was none, and\r\nhe, not being a good rider, would not ride any horse but one of his\r\nown. Alexander II. was very angry, and freely ventilated his anger.\r\n‘Imbecile (_durák_), have I only one horse?’ I heard him shout to an\r\norderly who reported that his horse was in another camp.\r\n\r\nWhat with the increasing darkness, the booming of the guns, and the\r\nrattling of the cavalry, we boys grew very much excited, and when\r\nAlexander ordered charging, our column charged straight upon him.\r\nTightly packed in the ranks, with lowered bayonets, we must have had\r\na menacing aspect, for I saw Alexander II. who was still on foot,\r\nclearing the way for the column in three formidable jumps. I understood\r\nthen the meaning of a column which is marching in serried ranks under\r\nthe excitement of the music and the march itself. There stood before us\r\nthe emperor--our commander, whom we all venerated very much; but I felt\r\nthat in this moving mass not one page or cadet would have moved an inch\r\naside, or stopped awhile, to make room for him. We were the marching\r\ncolumn--he was but an obstacle--and the column would have marched over\r\nhim. ‘Why should he be in our way?’ the pages said afterwards. Boys,\r\nrifle in hand, are even more terrible in such cases than old soldiers.\r\n\r\nNext year, when we took part in the great manœuvres of the St.\r\nPetersburg garrison, I got an insight into the sidelights of warfare.\r\nFor two days in succession we did nothing but march up and down on a\r\nspace of some twenty miles, without having the slightest idea of what\r\nwas going on round us or for what purpose we were marched. Cannon\r\nboomed now in our neighbourhood and now far away: sharp musketry fire\r\nwas heard somewhere in the hills and the woods; orderlies galloped\r\nup and down bringing the order to advance and next the order to\r\nretreat--and we marched, marched, and marched, seeing no sense in all\r\nthese movements and counter-movements. Masses of cavalry had passed\r\nalong the same road, making out of it a deep mass of movable sand; and\r\nwe had to advance and retreat several times along the same road, till\r\nat last our column broke all discipline and represented an incoherent\r\nmass of pilgrims rather than a military unit. The colours alone\r\nremained in the road; the remainder slowly paced along the sides of the\r\nroad, in the wood. The orders and supplications of the officers were of\r\nno avail.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a shout came from behind: ‘The emperor is coming! The\r\nemperor!’ The officers ran about supplicating us to gather in the\r\nranks: no one listened to them.\r\n\r\nThe emperor came and ordered to retreat once more--‘Turn round!’\r\nthe words of command resounded. ‘The emperor is behind us, please\r\nturn round,’ the officers whispered; but the battalion hardly took\r\nany notice of the command, and none whatever of the presence of the\r\nemperor. Happily, Alexander II. was no fanatic of militarism, and,\r\nafter having said a few words to cheer us with a promise of rest, he\r\ngalloped off.\r\n\r\nI understood then how much depends in warfare upon the state of mind\r\nof the troops, and how little can be done by mere discipline when\r\nmore than an average effort is required from the soldiers. What can\r\ndiscipline do when tired troops have to make a supreme effort to reach\r\nthe field of battle at a given hour? It is absolutely powerless. Only\r\nenthusiasm and confidence can at such moments induce the soldiers to\r\ndo ‘the impossible’--and it is the impossible that continually must\r\nbe accomplished to secure success. How often, later on in Siberia,\r\nI recalled to memory that object lesson when we also had to do the\r\nimpossible during our scientific expeditions!\r\n\r\nComparatively little of our time was, however, given during our stay\r\nin the camp to military drill and manœuvres. A good deal of it was\r\ngiven to practical exercises in surveys and fortification. After a few\r\npreliminary exercises we were given a reflecting compass and told:\r\n‘Go and make a plan of, say, this lake or those roads, or that park,\r\nmeasuring the angles with the compass and the distances with your\r\npace.’ And early in the morning, after a hurriedly swallowed breakfast,\r\nthe boy would fill his spacious military pockets with slices of rye\r\nbread, and would go out for four or five hours every day in the parks,\r\nmiles away, mapping with his compass and paces the beautiful shady\r\nroads, the rivulets, and the lakes. His work was later on compared\r\nwith accurate maps, and prizes in optical and drawing instruments\r\nat the boy’s choice were awarded. For me these surveys were a deep\r\nsource of enjoyment. That independent work, that isolation under the\r\ncenturies-old trees, that life of the forest which I could enjoy\r\nundisturbed, while there was at the same time the interest in the\r\nwork--all these left deep traces in my mind; and if I later on became\r\nan explorer of Siberia and several of my comrades became explorers in\r\nCentral Asia, the ground for it was prepared in these surveys.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, in the last form, parties of four boys were taken every\r\nsecond day to some villages at a considerable distance from the camp,\r\nand there they had to make a detailed survey of several square miles\r\nwith the aid of the surveyor’s table and a telescopic ruler. Officers\r\nof the General Staff came from time to time to verify their work and\r\nto advise them. This life amidst the peasants in the villages had the\r\nbest effect upon the intellectual and moral development of many boys.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, exercises were made in the construction of\r\nnatural-sized cross-sections of fortifications. We were taken out by an\r\nofficer in the open field, and there we had to make the cross-sections\r\nof a bastion, or of a bridge head, nailing poles and battens together\r\nin exactly the same way as railway engineers do in tracing a railway.\r\nWhen it came to embrasures and barbettes, we had to calculate a great\r\ndeal to obtain the inclinations of the different planes, and after that\r\ngeometry in the space ceased to be difficult to understand.\r\n\r\nWe delighted in such work, and once, in town, finding in our garden a\r\nheap of clay and gravel, we at once began to build a real fortification\r\non a reduced scale, with well-calculated straight and oblique\r\nembrasures and barbettes. All was done very neatly, and our ambition\r\nnow was to obtain some planks for making the platforms for the guns,\r\nand to place upon them the model guns which we had in our class-rooms.\r\n\r\nBut, alas, our trousers wore an alarming aspect. ‘What are you doing\r\nthere?’ our captain exclaimed. ‘Look at yourselves! You look like\r\nnavvies’ (that was exactly what we were proud of). ‘What if the Grand\r\nDuke comes and finds you in such a state!’\r\n\r\n‘We will show him our fortifications and ask him to get us tools and\r\nboards for the platforms.’\r\n\r\nAll protests were vain. A dozen workers were sent next day to cart away\r\nour beautiful work, as if it were a mere heap of mud!\r\n\r\nI mention this to show how children and youths long for real\r\napplications of what they learn at school in abstract, and how stupid\r\nare the educators who are unable to see what a powerful aid they could\r\nfind in concrete applications for helping their pupils to grasp the\r\nreal sense of the things they learn.\r\n\r\nIn our school all was directed towards training us for warfare. But\r\nwe should have worked with the same enthusiasm at tracing a railway,\r\nat building a log-house, or at cultivating a garden or a field.\r\nBut all this longing of the children and youths for _real_ work is\r\nwasted simply because our idea of the school is still the mediæval\r\nscholasticism, the mediæval monastery!\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nThe years 1857-61 were years of rich growth in the intellectual forces\r\nof Russia. All that had been whispered for the last decade, in the\r\nsecrecy of friendly meetings, by the generation represented in Russian\r\nliterature by Turguéneff, Tolstóy, Hérzen, Bakúnin, Ogaryóff, Kavélin,\r\nDostoévsky, Grigoróvich, Ostróvsky, and Nekrásoff, began now to leak\r\nout in the press. Censorship was still very rigorous; but what could\r\nnot be said openly in political articles was smuggled in under the\r\nform of novels, humorous sketches, or veiled comments on West European\r\nevents, and everyone read between the lines and understood.\r\n\r\nHaving no acquaintances at St. Petersburg apart from the school and a\r\nnarrow circle of relatives, I stood outside the radical movement of\r\nthose years--miles, in fact, away from it. And yet this was, perhaps,\r\nthe main feature of the movement--that it had the power to penetrate\r\ninto so ‘well meaning’ a school as our corps was, and to find an echo\r\nin such a circle as that of my Moscow relatives.\r\n\r\nI used at that time to spend my Sundays and holidays at the house of\r\nmy aunt, mentioned in a previous chapter under the name of Princess\r\nMírski. Prince Mírski thought only of extraordinary lunches and\r\ndinners, while his wife and their young daughter led a very gay\r\nlife. My cousin was a beautiful girl of nineteen, of a most amiable\r\ndisposition, and nearly all her male cousins were madly in love\r\nwith her. She, in turn, fell in love with one of them, and wanted to\r\nmarry him. But to marry a cousin is considered a great sin by the\r\nRussian Church, and the old princess tried in vain to obtain a special\r\npermission from the high ecclesiastical dignitaries. Now she brought\r\nher daughter to St. Petersburg, hoping that she might choose among\r\nher many admirers a more suitable husband than her own cousin. It was\r\nlabour lost, I must add; but their fashionable apartment was full of\r\nbrilliant young men from the Guards and from the diplomatic service.\r\n\r\nSuch a house would be the last to be thought of in connection with\r\nrevolutionary ideas; and yet it was in that house that I made my\r\nfirst acquaintance with the revolutionary literature of the times.\r\nThe great refugee, Hérzen, had just begun to issue at London his\r\nreview, ‘The Polar Star, which made a commotion in Russia, even in the\r\npalace circles, and was widely circulated secretly at St. Petersburg.\r\nMy cousin got it in some way, and we used to read it together. Her\r\nheart revolted against the obstacles which were put in the way of her\r\nhappiness, and her mind was the more open to the powerful criticisms\r\nwhich the great writer launched against the Russian autocracy and all\r\nthe rotten system of misgovernment. With a feeling near to worship I\r\nused to look on the medallion which was printed on the paper cover\r\nof ‘The Polar Star,’ and which represented the noble heads of the\r\nfive ‘Decembrists’ whom Nicholas I. had hanged after the rebellion\r\nof December 14, 1825--Bestúzheff, Kahóvskiy, Péstel, Ryléeff, and\r\nMuravióv-Apóstol.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of the style of Hérzen--of whom Turguéneff has truly said\r\nthat he wrote in tears and blood, and that no other Russian had ever\r\nso written--the breadth of his ideas, and his deep love of Russia took\r\npossession of me, and I used to read and re-read those pages, even more\r\nfull of heart than of brain.\r\n\r\nIn 1859, or early in 1860, I began to edit my first revolutionary\r\npaper. At that age, what could I be but a constitutionalist?--and my\r\npaper advocated the necessity of a constitution for Russia. I wrote\r\nabout the foolish expenses of the Court, the sums of money which were\r\nspent at Nice to keep quite a squadron of the navy in attendance on\r\nthe dowager Empress, who died in 1860; I mentioned the misdeeds of the\r\nfunctionaries which I continually heard spoken of, and I urged the\r\nnecessity of constitutional rule. I wrote three copies of my paper, and\r\nslipped them into the desks of three comrades of the higher forms, who,\r\nI thought, might be interested in public affairs. I asked my readers to\r\nput their remarks behind the Scotch grandfather clock in our library.\r\n\r\nWith a throbbing heart, I went next day to see if there was something\r\nfor me behind the clock. Two notes were there, indeed. Two comrades\r\nwrote that they fully sympathized with my paper, and only advised me\r\nnot to risk too much. I wrote my second number, still more vigorously\r\ninsisting upon the necessity of uniting all forces in the name of\r\nliberty. But this time there was no reply behind the clock. Instead the\r\ntwo comrades came to me.\r\n\r\n‘We are sure,’ they said, ‘that it is you who edit the paper, and we\r\nwant to talk about it. We are quite agreed with you, and we are here\r\nto say, “Let us be friends.” Your paper has done its work--it has\r\nbrought us together; but there is no need to continue it. In all the\r\nschool there are only two more who would take any interest in such\r\nmatters, while if it becomes known that there is a paper of this kind\r\nthe consequences will be terrible for all of us. Let us constitute a\r\ncircle and talk about everything; perhaps we shall put something into\r\nthe heads of a few others.’\r\n\r\nThis was so sensible that I could only agree, and we sealed our union\r\nby a hearty shaking of hands. From that time we three became firm\r\nfriends, and used to read a great deal together and discuss all sorts\r\nof things.\r\n\r\nThe abolition of serfdom was the question which then engrossed the\r\nattention of all thinking men.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution of 1848 had had its distinct echo in the hearts of the\r\nRussian peasant folk, and from the year 1850 the insurrections of\r\nrevolted serfs began to take serious proportions. When the Crimean war\r\nbroke out, and militia was levied all over Russia, these revolts spread\r\nwith a violence never before heard of. Several serf-owners were killed\r\nby their serfs, and the peasant uprisings became so serious that whole\r\nregiments, with artillery, were sent to quell them, whereas in former\r\ntimes small detachments of soldiers would have been sufficient to\r\nterrorize the peasants into obedience.\r\n\r\nThese outbreaks on the one side, and the profound aversion to serfdom\r\nwhich had grown up in the generation which came to the front with the\r\nadvent of Alexander II. to the throne, rendered the emancipation of\r\nthe peasants more and more imperative. The emperor, himself averse\r\nto serfdom, and supported, or rather influenced, in his own family\r\nby his wife, his brother Constantine, and the grand duchess Hélène\r\nPávlovna, took the first steps in that direction. His intention was\r\nthat the initiative of the reform should come from the nobility, the\r\nserf-owners themselves. But in no province of Russia could the nobility\r\nbe induced to send a petition to the Tsar to that effect. In March\r\n1856 he himself addressed the Moscow nobility on the necessity of such\r\na step; but a stubborn silence was all their reply to his speech, so\r\nthat Alexander II., growing quite angry, concluded with those memorable\r\nwords of Hérzen: ‘It is better, gentlemen, that it should come from\r\nabove than to wait till it comes from beneath.’ Even these words had no\r\neffect, and it was to the provinces of Old Poland--Gródno, Wílno, and\r\nKóvno--where Napoleon I. had abolished serfdom (on paper) in 1812, that\r\nrecourse was had. The Governor-General of those provinces, Nazímoff,\r\nmanaged to obtain the desired address from the Polish nobility. In\r\nNovember 1857 the famous ‘rescript’ to the Governor-General of the\r\nLithuanian provinces, announcing the intention of the emperor to\r\nabolish serfdom, was launched, and we read, with tears in our eyes,\r\nthe beautiful article of Hérzen, ‘Thou hast conquered, Galilean,’ in\r\nwhich the refugees in London declared that they would no more look upon\r\nAlexander II. as an enemy, but would support him in the great work of\r\nemancipation.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the peasants was very remarkable. No sooner had the\r\nnews spread that the liberation long sighed for was coming than the\r\ninsurrections nearly stopped. The peasants waited now, and during a\r\njourney which Alexander made in Middle Russia they flocked around\r\nhim as he passed, beseeching him to grant them liberty--a petition,\r\nhowever, which Alexander received with great repugnance. It is most\r\nremarkable--so strong is the force of tradition--that the rumour went\r\namong the peasants that it was Napoleon III. who had required of the\r\nTsar, in the treaty of peace, that the peasants should be freed. I\r\nfrequently heard this rumour; and on the very eve of the emancipation\r\nthey seemed to doubt that it would be done without pressure from\r\nabroad. ‘Nothing will be done unless Garibaldi comes,’ was the reply\r\nwhich a peasant made at St. Petersburg to a comrade of mine who talked\r\nto him about ‘freedom coming.’\r\n\r\nBut after these moments of general rejoicing years of incertitude and\r\ndisquiet followed. Specially appointed committees in the provinces\r\nand at St. Petersburg discussed the proposed liberation of the serfs,\r\nbut the intentions of Alexander II. seemed unsettled. A check was\r\ncontinually put upon the press, in order to prevent it from discussing\r\ndetails. Sinister rumours circulated at St. Petersburg and reached our\r\ncorps.\r\n\r\nThere was no lack of young men amongst the nobility who earnestly\r\nworked for a frank abolition of the old servitude; but the serfdom\r\nparty drew closer and closer round the emperor, and got power over his\r\nmind. They whispered into his ears that the day serfdom was abolished\r\nthe peasants would begin to kill the landlords wholesale, and Russia\r\nwould witness a new Pugachóff uprising, far more terrible than that\r\nof 1773. Alexander, who was a man of weak character, only too readily\r\nlent his ear to such predictions. But the huge machine for working out\r\nthe emancipation law had been set to work. The committees had their\r\nsittings; scores of schemes of emancipation, addressed to the emperor,\r\ncirculated in manuscript or were printed in London. Hérzen, seconded by\r\nTurguéneff, who kept him well informed about all that was going on in\r\ngovernment circles, discussed in his ‘Bell’ and his ‘Polar Star’ the\r\ndetails of the various schemes, and Chernyshévsky in the ‘Contemporary’\r\n(_Sovreménnik_). The Slavophiles, especially Aksákoff and Bélyáeff, had\r\ntaken advantage of the first moments of relative freedom allowed the\r\npress, to give the matter a wide publicity in Russia, and to discuss\r\nthe features of the emancipation with a thorough understanding of its\r\ntechnical aspects. All intellectual St. Petersburg was with Hérzen, and\r\nparticularly with Chernyshévsky, and I remember how the officers of the\r\nHorse Guards, whom I saw on Sundays, after the church parade, at the\r\nhome of my cousin (Dmítri Nikoláevich Kropótkin, who was aide-de-camp\r\nof that regiment and aide-de-camp of the emperor), used to side with\r\nChernyshévsky, the leader of the advanced party in the emancipation\r\nstruggle. The whole disposition of St. Petersburg, in the drawing-rooms\r\nand in the street, was such that it was impossible to go back. The\r\nliberation of the serfs had to be accomplished; and another important\r\npoint was won--the liberated serfs would receive, besides their\r\nhomesteads, the land that they had hitherto cultivated for themselves.\r\n\r\nHowever, the party of the old nobility were not discouraged. They\r\ncentred their efforts on obtaining a postponement of the reform,\r\non reducing the size of the allotments, and on imposing upon the\r\nemancipated serfs so high a redemption tax for the land that it would\r\nrender their economical freedom illusory; and in this they fully\r\nsucceeded. Alexander II. dismissed the real soul of the whole business,\r\nNikolái Milútin (brother of the minister of war), saying to him, ‘I am\r\nso sorry to part with you, but I must: the nobility describe you as one\r\nof the Reds.’ The first committees, which had worked out the scheme of\r\nemancipation, were dismissed too, and new committees revised the whole\r\nwork in the interest of the serf-owners; the press was muzzled once\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nThings assumed a very gloomy aspect. The question whether the\r\nliberation would take place at all was now asked. I feverishly followed\r\nthe struggle, and every Sunday, when my comrades returned from their\r\nhomes, I asked them what their parents said. By the end of 1860 the\r\nnews became worse and worse. ‘The Valúeff party has got the upper\r\nhand.’ ‘They intend to revise the whole work.’ ‘The relatives of the\r\nPrincess X. [a friend of the Tsar] work hard upon him,’ ‘The liberation\r\nwill be postponed: they fear a revolution.’\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn January 1861 slightly better rumours began to circulate, and it was\r\ngenerally hoped that something would be heard of the emancipation on\r\nthe day of the emperor’s accession to the throne, February 19.\r\n\r\nThe 19th came, but it brought nothing with it. I was on that day at\r\nthe palace. There was no grand _levée_, only a small one; and pages of\r\nthe second form were sent to such _levées_ in order to get accustomed\r\nto the palace ways. It was my turn that day; and as I was seeing off\r\none of the grand duchesses who came to the palace to assist at the\r\nMass, her husband did not appear and I went to fetch him. He was called\r\nout of the emperor’s study, and I told him, in a half jocose way, of\r\nthe perplexity of his wife, without having the slightest suspicion\r\nof the important matters that may have been talked of in the study at\r\nthat time. Apart from a few of the initiated, no one in the palace\r\nsuspected that the manifesto had been signed on February 19, and was\r\nkept back for a fortnight only because the next Sunday, the 26th, was\r\nthe beginning of the carnival week, and it was feared that, owing to\r\nthe drinking which goes on in the villages during the carnival, peasant\r\ninsurrections might break out. Even the carnival fair, which used\r\nto be held at St. Petersburg on the square near the winter palace,\r\nwas removed that year to another square, from fear of a popular\r\ninsurrection in the capital. Most sanguinary instructions had been\r\nissued to the army as to the ways of repressing peasant uprisings.\r\n\r\nA fortnight later, on the last Sunday of the carnival (March 5, or\r\nrather March 17, new style), I was at the corps, having to take part\r\nin the military parade at the riding-school. I was still in bed, when\r\nmy soldier servant, Ivánoff, dashed in with the tea-tray, exclaiming,\r\n‘Prince, freedom! The manifesto is posted on the Gostínoi Dvor’ (the\r\nshops opposite the corps).\r\n\r\n‘Did you see it yourself?’\r\n\r\n‘Yes. People stand round; one reads, the others listen. It _is_\r\nfreedom!’\r\n\r\nIn a couple of minutes I was dressed and out. A comrade was coming in.\r\n\r\n‘Kropótkin, freedom!’ he shouted. ‘Here is the manifesto. My uncle\r\nlearned last night that it would be read at the early Mass at the Isaac\r\nCathedral; so we went. There were not many people there; peasants\r\nonly. The manifesto was read and distributed after the Mass. They well\r\nunderstood what it meant: when I came out of the church, two peasants,\r\nwho stood in the gateway, said to me in such a droll way, “Well, sir?\r\nnow--all gone?”’ And he mimicked how they had shown him the way out.\r\nYears of expectation were in that gesture of sending away the master.\r\n\r\nI read and re-read the manifesto. It was written in an elevated style\r\nby the old metropolitan of Moscow, Philarète, but with a useless\r\nmixture of Russian and old Slavonian which obscured the sense. It was\r\nliberty; but it was not liberty yet, the peasants having to remain\r\nserfs for two years more, till February 19, 1863. Notwithstanding all\r\nthis, one thing was evident: serfdom was abolished, and the liberated\r\nserfs would get the land and their homesteads. They would have to pay\r\nfor it, but the old stain of slavery was removed. They would be slaves\r\nno more; the reaction had _not_ got the upper hand.\r\n\r\nWe went to the parade; and when all the military performances were\r\nover, Alexander II., remaining on horseback, loudly called out, ‘The\r\nofficers to me!’ They gathered round him, and he began, in a loud\r\nvoice, a speech about the great event of the day.\r\n\r\n‘The officers ... the representatives of the nobility in the\r\narmy’--these scraps of sentences reached our ears--‘an end has been put\r\nto centuries of injustice.... I expect sacrifices from the nobility\r\n... the loyal nobility will gather round the throne’ ... and so on.\r\nEnthusiastic hurrahs resounded amongst the officers as he ended.\r\n\r\nWe ran rather than marched back on our way to the corps--hurrying to\r\nbe in time for the Italian opera, of which the last performance in the\r\nseason was to be given that afternoon; some manifestation was sure to\r\ntake place then. Our military attire was flung off with great haste,\r\nand several of us dashed, lightfooted, to the sixth-story gallery. The\r\nhouse was crowded.\r\n\r\nDuring the first entr’acte the smoking-room of the opera filled with\r\nexcited young men, who all talked to one another, whether acquainted or\r\nnot. We planned at once to return to the hall, and to sing, with the\r\nwhole public in a mass choir, the hymn ‘God save the Tsar.’\r\n\r\nHowever, sounds of music reached our ears, and we all hurried back to\r\nthe hall. The band of the opera was already playing the hymn, which was\r\ndrowned immediately in enthusiastic hurrahs coming from the galleries,\r\nthe boxes, the pit. I saw Bavéri, the conductor, waving his stick,\r\nbut not a sound could be heard from the powerful band. Then Bavéri\r\nstopped, but the hurrahs continued. I saw the stick waved again in\r\nthe air; I saw the fiddle bows moving and musicians blowing the brass\r\ninstruments, but again the sound of voices overwhelmed the band. Bavéri\r\nbegan conducting the hymn once more, and it was only by the end of that\r\nthird repetition that isolated sounds of the brass instruments pierced\r\nthrough the clamour of human voices.\r\n\r\nThe same enthusiasm was in the streets. Crowds of peasants and educated\r\nmen stood in front of the palace, shouting hurrahs, and the Tsar could\r\nnot appear without being followed by demonstrative crowds running after\r\nhis carriage. Hérzen was right when, two years later, as Alexander was\r\ndrowning the Polish insurrection in blood, and ‘Muravióff the Hanger’\r\nwas strangling it on the scaffold, he wrote, ‘Alexander Nikoláevich,\r\nwhy did you not die on that day? Your name would have been transmitted\r\nin history as that of a hero.’\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhere were the uprisings which had been predicted by the champions\r\nof slavery? Conditions more indefinite than those which had been\r\ncreated by the Polozhénie (the emancipation law) could not have been\r\ninvented. If anything could have provoked revolts, it was precisely\r\nthe perplexing vagueness of the conditions created by the new law.\r\nAnd yet--except in two places where there were insurrections, and\r\na very few other spots where small disturbances, entirely due to\r\nmisunderstandings and immediately appeased, took place--Russia remained\r\nquiet, more quiet than ever. With their usual good sense, the peasants\r\nhad understood that serfdom was done away with, that ‘freedom had\r\ncome,’ and they accepted the conditions imposed upon them, although\r\nthese conditions were very heavy.\r\n\r\nI was in Nikólskoye in August 1861, and again in the summer of\r\n1862, and I was struck with the quiet intelligent way in which the\r\npeasants had accepted the new conditions. They knew perfectly well how\r\ndifficult it would be to pay the redemption tax for the land, which\r\nwas in reality an indemnity to the nobles in lieu of the obligations\r\nof serfdom. But they so much valued the abolition of their personal\r\nenslavement that they accepted the ruinous charges--not without\r\nmurmuring, but as a hard necessity--the moment that personal freedom\r\nwas obtained. For the first months they kept two holidays a week,\r\nsaying that it was a sin to work on Friday; but when the summer came\r\nthey resumed work with even more energy than before.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw our Nikólskoye peasants, fifteen months after the\r\nliberation, I could not but admire them. Their inborn good nature\r\nand softness remained with them, but all traces of servility had\r\ndisappeared. They talked to their masters as equals talk to equals,\r\nas if they never had stood in different relations. Besides, such men\r\ncame out from among them as could make a stand for their rights. The\r\nPolozhénie was a large and difficult book, which it took me a good\r\ndeal of time to understand; but when Vasíli Ivánoff, the elder of\r\nNikólskoye, came one day to ask me to explain to him some obscurity\r\nin it, I saw that he, who was not even a fluent reader, had admirably\r\nfound his way amongst the intricacies of the chapters and paragraphs of\r\nthe law.\r\n\r\nThe ‘household people’--that is, the servants--came out the worst\r\nof all. They got no land, and would hardly have known what to do\r\nwith it if they had. They got freedom, and nothing besides. In our\r\nneighbourhood nearly all of them left their masters; none, for\r\nexample, remained in the household of my father. They went in search\r\nof positions elsewhere, and a number of them found employment at once\r\nwith the merchant class, who were proud of having the coachman of\r\nPrince So-and-So, or the cook of General So-and-So. Those who knew a\r\ntrade found work in the towns: for instance, my father’s band remained\r\na band, and made a good living at Kalúga, retaining amiable relations\r\nwith us. But those who had no trade had hard times before them, and yet\r\nthe majority preferred to live anyhow rather than remain with their old\r\nmasters.\r\n\r\nAs to the landlords, while the larger ones made all possible efforts\r\nat St. Petersburg to re-introduce the old conditions under one name\r\nor another (they succeeded in doing so to some extent under Alexander\r\nIII.), by far the greater number submitted to the abolition of serfdom\r\nas to a sort of necessary calamity. The young generation gave to Russia\r\nthat remarkable staff of ‘peace mediators’ and justices of the peace\r\nwho contributed so much to the peaceful issue of the emancipation.\r\nAs to the old generation, most of them had already discounted the\r\nconsiderable sums of money they were to receive from the peasants for\r\nthe land which was granted to the liberated serfs, and which was valued\r\nmuch above its market price; they schemed as to how they would squander\r\nthat money in the restaurants of the capitals, or at the green tables\r\nin gambling. And they did squander it, almost all of them, as soon as\r\nthey got it.\r\n\r\nFor many landlords the liberation of the serfs was an excellent\r\nmoney transaction. Thus, land which my father, in anticipation of\r\nthe emancipation, sold in parcels at the rate of eleven roubles the\r\nRussian acre, was now estimated at forty roubles in the peasants’\r\nallotments--that is, three and a half times above its market\r\nvalue--and this was the rule in all our neighbourhood; while in my\r\nfather’s Tambóv estate, on the prairies, the _mir_--that is, the\r\nvillage community--rented all his land for twelve years at a price\r\nwhich represented twice as much as he used to get from that land by\r\ncultivating it with servile labour.\r\n\r\nEleven years after that memorable time I went to the Tambóv estate,\r\nwhich I had inherited from my father. I stayed there for a few weeks,\r\nand on the evening of my departure our village priest--an intelligent\r\nman of independent opinions, such as one meets occasionally in our\r\nsouthern provinces--went out for a walk round the village. The\r\nsunset was glorious; a balmy air came from the prairies. He found a\r\nmiddle-aged peasant--Antón Savélieff--sitting on a small eminence\r\noutside the village and reading a book of psalms. The peasant hardly\r\nknew how to spell in Old Slavonic, and often he would read a book\r\nfrom the last page, turning the pages backward; it was the process of\r\nreading which he liked most, and then a word would strike him, and its\r\nrepetition pleased him. He was reading now a psalm of which each verse\r\nbegan with the word ‘rejoice.’\r\n\r\n‘What are you reading?’ he was asked.\r\n\r\n‘Well, father, I will tell you,’ was his reply. ‘Fourteen years ago\r\nthe old prince came here. It was in the winter. I had just returned\r\nhome, quite frozen. A snowstorm was raging. I had scarcely begun\r\nundressing when we heard a knock at the window: it was the elder, who\r\nwas shouting, “Go to the prince! He wants you!” We all--my wife and\r\nour children--were thunderstricken. “What can he want of you?” my wife\r\ncried in alarm. I signed myself with the cross and went; the snowstorm\r\nalmost blinded me as I crossed the bridge. Well, it ended all right.\r\nThe old prince was taking his afternoon sleep, and when he woke up he\r\nasked me if I knew plastering work, and only told me, “Come to-morrow\r\nto repair the plaster in that room.” So I went home quite happy, and\r\nwhen I came to the bridge I found my wife standing there. She had stood\r\nthere all the time in the snowstorm, with the baby in her arms, waiting\r\nfor me. “What has happened, Savélich?” she cried. “Well,” I said, “no\r\nharm; he only asked me to make some repairs.” That, father, was under\r\nthe old prince. And now, the young prince came here the other day. I\r\nwent to see him, and found him in the garden, at the tea table, in the\r\nshadow of the house; you, father, sat with him, and the elder of the\r\ncanton, with his mayor’s chain upon his breast. “Will you have tea,\r\nSavélich?” he asks me. “Take a chair. Petr Grigórieff”--he says that\r\nto the old one--“give us one more chair.” And Petr Grigórieff--you\r\nknow what a terror for us he was when he was the manager of the old\r\nprince--brought the chair, and we all sat round the tea table, talking,\r\nand he poured out tea for all of us. Well, now, father, the evening is\r\nso beautiful, the balm comes from the prairies, and I sit and read,\r\n“Rejoice! Rejoice!”’\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis is what the abolition of serfdom meant for the peasants.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nIn June 1861 I was nominated sergeant of the Corps of Pages. Some of\r\nour officers, I must say, did not like the idea of it, saying that\r\nthere would be no discipline with me acting as a sergeant, but it could\r\nnot be helped; it was usually the first pupil of the upper form who was\r\nnominated sergeant, and I had been at the top of our form for several\r\nyears in succession. This appointment was considered very enviable, not\r\nonly because the sergeant occupied a privileged position in the school\r\nand was treated like an officer, but especially because he was also the\r\npage de chambre of the emperor for the time being; and to be personally\r\nknown to the emperor was of course considered as a stepping-stone to\r\nfurther distinctions. The most important point to me was, however,\r\nthat it freed me from all the drudgery of the inner service of the\r\nschool, which fell on the pages de chambre, and that I should have\r\nfor my studies a separate room where I could isolate myself from the\r\nbustle of the school. True, there was also an important drawback to it:\r\nI had always found it tedious to pace up and down, many times a day,\r\nthe whole length of our rooms, and used therefore to run the distance\r\nfull speed, which was severely prohibited; and now I should have to\r\nwalk very solemnly, with the service book under my arm, instead of\r\nrunning! A consultation was even held among a few friends of mine upon\r\nthis serious matter, and it was decided that from time to time I could\r\nstill find opportunities to take my favourite runs; as to my relations\r\nwith all the others, it depended upon myself to put them on a new\r\ncomradelike footing, and this I did.\r\n\r\nThe pages de chambre had to be at the palace frequently, in attendance\r\nat the great and small _levées_, the balls, the receptions, the gala\r\ndinners, and so on. During Christmas, New Year, and Easter weeks we\r\nwere summoned to the palace almost every day, and sometimes twice a\r\nday. Moreover, in my military capacity of sergeant I had to report to\r\nthe emperor every Sunday, at the parade in the riding-school, that ‘all\r\nwas well at the company of the Corps of Pages,’ even when one-third\r\nof the school was ill of some contagious disease. ‘Shall I not report\r\nto-day that all is not quite well?’ I asked the colonel on this\r\noccasion. ‘God bless you,’ was his reply, ‘you ought only to say so if\r\nthere were an insurrection!’\r\n\r\nCourt life has undoubtedly much that is picturesque about it. With its\r\nelegant refinement of manners--superficial though it may be--its strict\r\netiquette, and its brilliant surroundings, it is certainly meant to\r\nbe impressive. A great _levée_ is a fine pageant, and even the simple\r\nreception of a few ladies by the empress becomes quite different from\r\na common call when it takes place in a richly decorated drawing-room\r\nof the palace--the guests ushered by chamberlains in gold-embroidered\r\nuniforms, the hostess followed by brilliantly dressed pages and a\r\nsuite of ladies, and everything conducted with striking solemnity.\r\nTo be an actor in the Court ceremonies, in attendance upon the chief\r\npersonages, offered something more than the mere interest of curiosity\r\nfor a boy of my age. Besides, I then looked upon Alexander II. as a\r\nsort of hero; a man who attached no importance to the Court ceremonies,\r\nbut who, at this period of his reign, began his working day at six\r\nin the morning, and was engaged in a hard struggle with a powerful\r\nreactionary party in order to carry through a series of reforms in\r\nwhich the abolition of serfdom was only the first step.\r\n\r\nBut gradually, as I saw more of the spectacular side of Court life,\r\nand caught now and then a glimpse of what was going on behind the\r\nscenes, I realized not only the futility of these shows and the things\r\nthey were intended to conceal, but also that these small things so\r\nmuch absorbed the Court as to prevent consideration of matters of far\r\ngreater importance. The realities were often lost in the acting. And\r\nthen from Alexander II. himself slowly faded the aureole with which my\r\nimagination had surrounded him; so that by the end of the year, even if\r\nat the outset I had cherished some illusions as to useful activity in\r\nthe spheres nearest to the palace, I should have retained none.\r\n\r\nOn every important holiday, as also on the birthdays and name days\r\nof the emperor and empress, on the coronation day, and on other\r\nsimilar occasions, a great _levée_ was held at the palace. Thousands\r\nof generals and officers of all ranks, down to that of captain, as\r\nwell as the high functionaries of the civil service, were arranged in\r\nlines in the immense halls of the palace, to bow at the passage of the\r\nemperor and his family, as they solemnly proceeded to the church. All\r\nthe members of the imperial family came on those days to the palace,\r\nmeeting together in a drawing-room and merrily chatting till the moment\r\narrived for putting on the mask of solemnity. Then the column was\r\nformed. The emperor, giving his hand to the empress, opened the march.\r\nHe was followed by his page de chambre, and he in turn by the general\r\naide-de-camp, the aide-de-camp on duty that day, and the minister of\r\nthe imperial household; while the empress, or rather the immense train\r\nof her dress, was attended by her two pages de chambre, who had to\r\nsupport the train at the turnings and to spread it out again in all its\r\nbeauty. The heir-apparent, who was a young man of eighteen, and all\r\nthe other grand dukes and duchesses, came next, in the order of their\r\nright of succession to the throne--each of the grand duchesses followed\r\nby her page de chambre; then there was a long procession of the ladies\r\nin attendance, old and young, all wearing the so-called Russian\r\ncostume--that is, an evening dress which was supposed to resemble the\r\ncostume worn by the women of Old Russia.\r\n\r\nAs the procession passed I could see how each of the eldest military\r\nand civil functionaries, before making his bow, would try to catch the\r\neye of the emperor, and if he had his bow acknowledged by a smiling\r\nlook of the Tsar, or by a hardly perceptible nod of the head, or\r\nperchance by a word or two, he would look round upon his neighbours,\r\nfull of pride, in the expectation of their congratulations.\r\n\r\nFrom the church the procession returned in the same way, and then\r\neveryone hurried back to his own affairs. Apart from a few devotees and\r\nsome young ladies, not one in ten present at these _levées_ regarded\r\nthem otherwise than as a tedious duty.\r\n\r\nTwice or thrice during the winter great balls were given at the palace,\r\nand thousands of people were invited to them. After the emperor had\r\nopened the dances with a polonaise, full liberty was left to every one\r\nto enjoy the time as he liked. There was plenty of room in the immense\r\nbrightly illuminated halls, where young girls were easily lost to the\r\nwatchful eyes of their parents and aunts, and many thoroughly enjoyed\r\nthe dances and the supper, during which the young people managed to be\r\nleft to themselves.\r\n\r\nMy duties at these balls were rather difficult. Alexander II. did\r\nnot dance, nor did he sit down, but he moved all the time amongst\r\nhis guests, his page de chambre having to follow him at a distance,\r\nso as to be within easy call, and yet not inconveniently near. This\r\ncombination of presence with absence was not easy to attain, nor did\r\nthe emperor require it: he would have preferred to be left entirely to\r\nhimself; but such was the tradition, and he had to submit to it. The\r\nworst was when he entered a dense crowd of ladies who stood round the\r\ncircle in which the grand dukes danced, and slowly circulated among\r\nthem. It was not at all easy to make a way through this living garden,\r\nwhich opened to give passage to the emperor, but closed in immediately\r\nbehind him. Instead of dancing themselves, hundreds of ladies and girls\r\nstood there, closely packed, each in the expectation that one of the\r\ngrand dukes would perhaps notice her and invite her to dance a waltz\r\nor a polka. Such was the influence of the Court upon St. Petersburg\r\nsociety that if one of the grand dukes cast his eye upon a girl, her\r\nparents would do all in their power to make their child fall madly\r\nin love with the great personage, even though they knew well that\r\nno marriage could result from it--the Russian grand dukes not being\r\nallowed to marry ‘subjects’ of the Tsar. The conversations which I once\r\nheard in a ‘respectable’ family, connected with the Court, after the\r\nheir-apparent had danced twice or thrice with a girl of seventeen, and\r\nthe hopes which were expressed by her parents, surpassed all that I\r\ncould possibly have imagined.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEvery time that we were at the palace we had lunch or dinner there,\r\nand the footmen would whisper to us bits of news from the scandalous\r\nchronicle of the place, whether we cared for it or not. They knew\r\neverything that was going on in the different palaces--that was their\r\ndomain. For truth’s sake, I must say that during the year which I speak\r\nof that sort of chronicle was not as rich in events as it became in the\r\nseventies. The brothers of the Tsar were only recently married, and\r\nhis sons were all very young. But the relations of the emperor himself\r\nwith the Princess X., whom Turguéneff has so admirably depicted in\r\n‘Smoke’ under the name of Irène, were even more freely spoken of by\r\nthe servants than by St. Petersburg society. One day, however, when\r\nwe entered the room where we used to dress, we were told, ‘The X. has\r\nto-day got her dismissal--a complete one this time.’ Half an hour\r\nlater we saw the lady in question coming to assist at Mass, with her\r\neyes swollen from weeping, and swallowing her tears during the Mass,\r\nwhile the other ladies managed so to stand at a distance from her as\r\nto put her in evidence. The footmen were already informed about the\r\nincident, and commented upon it in their own way. There was something\r\ntruly repulsive in the talk of these men, who the day before would have\r\ncrouched down before the same lady.\r\n\r\nThe system of espionage which is exercised in the palace, especially\r\naround the emperor himself, would seem almost incredible to the\r\nuninitiated. The following incident will give some idea of it. A few\r\nyears later, one of the grand dukes received a severe lesson from a\r\nSt. Petersburg gentleman. The latter had forbidden the grand duke\r\nhis house, but, returning home unexpectedly, he found him in his\r\ndrawing-room and rushed upon him with his lifted stick. The young man\r\ndashed down the staircase, and was already jumping into his carriage\r\nwhen the pursuer caught him, and dealt him a blow with his stick. The\r\npoliceman who stood at the door saw the adventure and ran to report\r\nit to the chief of the police, General Trépoff, who, in his turn,\r\njumped into his carriage and hastened to the emperor, to be the first\r\nto report the ‘sad incident.’ Alexander II. summoned the grand duke\r\nand had a talk with him. A couple of days later, an old functionary\r\nwho belonged to the Third Section of the emperor’s chancery--that is,\r\nto the state police--and who was a friend at the house of one of my\r\ncomrades, related the whole conversation. ‘The emperor,’ he informed\r\nus, ‘was very angry, and said to the grand duke in conclusion, “You\r\nshould know better how to manage your little affairs.”’ He was asked,\r\nof course, how he could know anything about a private conversation, but\r\nthe reply was very characteristic: ‘The words and the opinions of his\r\nMajesty must be known to our department. How otherwise could such a\r\ndelicate institution as the state police be managed? Be sure that the\r\nemperor is the most closely watched person in all St. Petersburg.’\r\n\r\nThere was no boasting in these words. Every minister, every\r\ngovernor-general, before entering the emperor’s study with his reports,\r\nhad a talk with the private valet of the emperor, to know what was\r\nthe mood of the master that day; and according to that mood he either\r\nlaid before him some knotty affair, or let it lie at the bottom of\r\nhis portfolio in hope of a more lucky day. The governor-general of\r\nEast Siberia, when he came to St. Petersburg, always sent his private\r\naide-de-camp with a handsome gift to the private valet of the emperor.\r\n‘There are days,’ he used to say, ‘when the emperor would get into a\r\nrage, and order a searching inquest upon everyone and myself, if I\r\nshould lay before him on such a day certain reports; whereas there are\r\nother days when all will go off quite smoothly. A precious man that\r\nvalet is.’ To know from day to day the frame of mind of the emperor\r\nwas a substantial part of the art of retaining a high position--an\r\nart which later on Count Shuváloff and General Trépoff understood to\r\nperfection; also Count Ignátieff, who, I suppose from what I saw of\r\nhim, possessed that art even without the help of the valet.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of my service I felt a great admiration for Alexander\r\nII., the liberator of the serfs. Imagination often carries a boy beyond\r\nthe realities of the moment, and my frame of mind at that time was such\r\nthat if an attempt had been made in my presence upon the Tsar I should\r\nhave covered him with my body. One day, at the beginning of January\r\n1862, I saw him leave the procession and rapidly walk alone toward the\r\nhalls where parts of all the regiments of the St. Petersburg garrison\r\nwere aligned for a parade. This parade usually took place outdoors, but\r\nthis year, on account of the frost, it was held indoors, and Alexander\r\nII., who generally galloped at full speed in front of the troops at\r\nthe reviews, had now to march in front of the regiments. I knew that\r\nmy Court duties ended as soon as the emperor appeared in his capacity\r\nof military commander of the troops, and that I had to follow him to\r\nthis spot, but no further. However, on looking round, I saw that he was\r\nquite alone. The two aides-de-camp had disappeared, and there was with\r\nhim not a single man of his suite. ‘I will not leave him alone!’ I said\r\nto myself, and followed him.\r\n\r\nWhether Alexander II. was in a great hurry that day, or had other\r\nreasons to wish that the review should be over as soon as possible, I\r\ncannot say, but he dashed in front of the troops, and marched along\r\ntheir rows at such a speed, making such big and rapid steps--he was\r\nvery tall--that I had the greatest difficulty in following him at my\r\nmost rapid pace, and in places had almost to run in order to keep close\r\nbehind him. He hurried as if he ran away from a danger. His excitement\r\ncommunicated itself to me, and every moment I was ready to jump in\r\nfront of him, regretting only that I had on my ordnance sword and not\r\nmy own sword, with a Toledo blade, which pierced coppers and was a far\r\nbetter weapon. It was only after he had passed in front of the last\r\nbattalion that he slackened his pace, and, on entering another hall,\r\nlooked round, to meet my eyes glittering with the excitement of that\r\nmad march. The younger aide-de-camp was running at full speed, two\r\nhalls behind. I was prepared to get a severe scolding, instead of which\r\nAlexander II. said to me, perhaps betraying his own inner thoughts:\r\n‘You here? Brave boy!’ and as he slowly walked away he turned into\r\nspace that problematic, absent-minded gaze which I had begun often to\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nSuch was then the attitude of my mind. However, various small\r\nincidents, as well as the reactionary character which the policy of\r\nAlexander II. was decidedly taking, instilled more and more doubts\r\ninto my heart. Every year, on January 6, a half Christian and half\r\npagan ceremony of sanctifying the waters is performed in Russia. It is\r\nalso performed at the palace. A pavilion is built on the Nevá River,\r\nopposite the palace, and the imperial family, headed by the clergy,\r\nproceed from the palace, across the superb quay, to the pavilion, where\r\na Te Deum is sung, and the cross is plunged into the water of the\r\nriver. Thousands of people stand on the quay and on the ice of the Nevá\r\nto witness the ceremony from a distance. All have to stand bareheaded\r\nduring the service. This year, as the frost was rather sharp, an old\r\ngeneral had put on a wig, and in the hurry of drawing on his cape,\r\nhis wig had been dislodged and now lay across his head, without his\r\nnoticing it. The grand duke Constantine, having caught sight of it,\r\nlaughed the whole time the Te Deum was being sung, with the younger\r\ngrand dukes, looking in the direction of the unhappy general, who\r\nsmiled stupidly without knowing why he was the cause of so much\r\nhilarity. Constantine finally whispered to the emperor, who also looked\r\nat the general and laughed.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later, as the procession once more crossed the quay, on\r\nits way back to the palace, an old peasant, bareheaded too, pushed\r\nhimself through the double hedge of soldiers who lined the path of the\r\nprocession, and fell on his knees just at the feet of the emperor,\r\nholding out a petition, and crying with tears in his eyes, ‘Father,\r\ndefend us!’ Ages of oppression of the Russian peasantry was in this\r\nexclamation; but Alexander II., who a few minutes before laughed during\r\nthe church service at a wig lying the wrong way, now passed by the\r\npeasant without taking the slightest notice of him. I was close behind\r\nhim, and only saw in him a shudder of fear at the sudden appearance\r\nof the peasant, after which he went on without deigning even to\r\ncast a glance on the human figure at his feet. I looked round. The\r\naides-de-camp were not there; the grand duke Constantine, who followed,\r\ntook no more notice of the peasant than his brother did; there was\r\nnobody even to take the petition, so that I took it, although I knew\r\nthat I should get a scolding for doing so. It was not my business to\r\nreceive petitions, but I remembered what it must have cost the peasant\r\nbefore he could make his way to the capital, and then through the lines\r\nof police and soldiers who surrounded the procession. Like all peasants\r\nwho hand petitions to the Tsar, he was going to be put under arrest,\r\nfor no one knows how long.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the day of the emancipation of the serfs Alexander II. was\r\nworshipped at St. Petersburg; but it is most remarkable that, apart\r\nfrom that moment of general enthusiasm, he had not the love of the\r\ncity. His brother Nicholas--no one could say why--was at least very\r\npopular among the small tradespeople and the cabmen; but neither\r\nAlexander II., nor his brother Constantine, the leader of the reform\r\nparty, nor his third brother, Michael, had won the hearts of any class\r\nof people in St. Petersburg. Alexander II. had retained too much of\r\nthe despotic character of his father, which pierced now and then\r\nthrough his usually good-natured manners. He easily lost his temper,\r\nand often treated his courtiers in the most contemptuous way. He was\r\nnot what one would describe as a reliable man, either in his policy\r\nor in his personal sympathies, and he was vindictive. I doubt whether\r\nhe was sincerely attached to anyone. Some of the men in his nearest\r\nsurroundings were of the worst description--Count Adlerberg, for\r\ninstance, who made him pay over and over again his enormous debts, and\r\nothers renowned for their colossal thefts. From the beginning of 1862\r\nhe commenced to show himself capable of reviving the worst practices\r\nof his father’s reign. It was known that he still wanted to carry\r\nthrough a series of important reforms in the judicial organization\r\nand in the army; that the terrible corporal punishments were about to\r\nbe abolished, and that a sort of local self-government, and perhaps\r\na constitution of some sort, would be granted. But the slightest\r\ndisturbance was repressed under his orders with a stern severity; he\r\ntook each movement as a personal offence, so that at any moment one\r\nmight expect from him the most reactionary measures.\r\n\r\nThe disorders which broke out at the universities of St.\r\nPetersburg, Moscow, and Kazán in October 1861 were repressed with\r\nan ever-increasing strictness. The university of St. Petersburg\r\nwas closed, and although free courses were opened by most of the\r\nprofessors at the Town Hall, they also were soon closed, and the best\r\nprofessors left the university. Immediately after the abolition of\r\nserfdom, a great movement began for the opening of Sunday schools; they\r\nwere opened everywhere by private persons and corporations--all the\r\nteachers being volunteers--and the peasants and workers, old and young,\r\nflocked to these schools. Officers, students, even a few pages, became\r\nteachers; and such excellent methods were worked out that (Russian\r\nhaving a phonetic spelling) we succeeded in teaching a peasant to read\r\nin nine or ten lessons. But suddenly all Sunday schools, in which\r\nthe mass of the peasantry would have learned to read in a few years,\r\nwithout any expenditure by the State, were closed. In Poland, where a\r\nseries of patriotic manifestations had begun, the Cossacks were sent\r\nout to disperse the crowds with their whips, and to arrest hundreds of\r\npeople in the churches with their usual brutality. Men were shot in the\r\nstreets of Warsaw by the end of 1861, and for the suppression of the\r\nfew peasant insurrections which broke out the horrible flogging through\r\nthe double line of soldiers--that favourite punishment of Nicholas\r\nI.--was applied. The despot that Alexander II. became in the years\r\n1870-81 was foreshadowed in 1862.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf all the imperial family, undoubtedly the most sympathetic was\r\nthe empress Marie Alexándrovna. She was sincere, and when she said\r\nsomething pleasant she meant it. The way in which she once thanked me\r\nfor a little courtesy (it was after her reception of the ambassador\r\nof the United States, who had just come to St. Petersburg) deeply\r\nimpressed me: it was not the way of a lady spoiled by courtesies, as\r\nan empress is supposed to be. She certainly was not happy in her home\r\nlife; nor was she liked by the ladies of the court, who found her too\r\nsevere, and could not understand why she should take so much to heart\r\nthe _étourderies_ of her husband. It is now known that she played a by\r\nno means unimportant part in bringing about the abolition of serfdom.\r\nBut at that time her influence in this direction seems to have been\r\nlittle known, the grand duke Constantine and the grand duchess Hélène\r\nPávlovna, who was the main support of Nicholas Milútin at the Court,\r\nbeing considered the two leaders of the reform party in the palace\r\nspheres. The empress was better known for the decisive part she had\r\ntaken in the creation of girls’ gymnasia (high schools), which received\r\nfrom the outset a high standard of organization and a truly democratic\r\ncharacter. Her friendly relations with Ushínsky, a great pedagogist,\r\nsaved him from sharing the fate of all men of mark of that time--that\r\nis, exile.\r\n\r\nBeing very well educated herself, Marie Alexándrovna did her best to\r\ngive a good education to her eldest son. The best men in all branches\r\nof knowledge were sought as teachers, and she even invited for that\r\npurpose Kavélin, although she knew well his friendly relations with\r\nHérzen. When he mentioned to her that friendship, she replied that she\r\nhad no grudge against Hérzen, except for his violent language about the\r\nempress dowager.\r\n\r\nThe heir-apparent was extremely handsome--perhaps, even too femininely\r\nhandsome. He was not proud in the least, and during the _levées_\r\nhe used to chatter in the most comradelike way with the pages de\r\nchambre. (I even remember, at the reception of the diplomatic corps on\r\nNew Year’s Day, trying to make him appreciate the simplicity of the\r\nuniform of the ambassador of the United States as compared with the\r\nparrot-coloured uniforms of the other ambassadors.) However, those who\r\nknew him well described him as profoundly egoistic, a man absolutely\r\nincapable of contracting an attachment to anyone. This feature was\r\nprominent in him, even more than it was in his father. As to his\r\neducation, all the pains taken by his mother were of no avail. In\r\nAugust 1861 his examinations, which were made in the presence of his\r\nfather, proved to be a dead failure, and I remember Alexander II., at a\r\nparade of which the heir-apparent was the commander, and during which\r\nhe made some mistake, loudly shouting out, so that everyone would hear\r\nit, ‘Even that you could not learn!’ He died, as is known, at the age\r\nof twenty-two, from some disease of the spinal cord.\r\n\r\nHis brother, Alexander, who became the heir-apparent in 1865, and later\r\non was Alexander III., was a decided contrast to Nikolái Alexándrovich.\r\nHe reminded me so much of Paul I. by his face, his figure, and his\r\ncontemplation of his own grandeur, that I used to say, ‘If he ever\r\nreigns, he will be another Paul I. in the Gátchina palace, and will\r\nhave the same end as his great-grandfather had at the hands of his\r\nown courtiers.’ He obstinately refused to learn. It was rumoured\r\nthat Alexander II., having had so many difficulties with his brother\r\nConstantine, who was better educated than himself, adopted the policy\r\nof concentrating all his attention on the heir-apparent and neglecting\r\nthe education of his other sons; however, I doubt if such was the\r\ncase: Alexander Alexándrovich must have been averse to any education\r\nfrom childhood; in fact, his spelling, which I saw in the telegrams he\r\naddressed to his bride at Copenhagen, was unimaginably bad. I cannot\r\nrender here his Russian spelling, but in French he wrote, ‘_Ecri_ à\r\noncle à propos parade ... les nouvelles sont _mauvaisent_,’ and so on.\r\n\r\nHe is said to have improved in his manners toward the end of his life,\r\nbut in 1870, and also much later, he was a true descendant of Paul I.\r\nI knew at St. Petersburg an officer, of Swedish origin (from Finland),\r\nwho had been sent to the United States to order rifles for the Russian\r\narmy. On his return he had to report about his mission to Alexander\r\nAlexándrovich, who had been appointed to superintend the re-arming of\r\nthe army. During this interview, the Tsarevich, giving full vent to his\r\nviolent temper, began to scold the officer, who probably replied with\r\ndignity, whereupon the prince fell into a real fit of rage, insulting\r\nthe officer in bad language. The officer, who belonged to that type of\r\nvery loyal but self-respecting men who are frequently met with amongst\r\nthe Swedish nobility in Russia, left at once, and wrote a letter in\r\nwhich he asked the heir-apparent to apologize within twenty-four hours,\r\nadding that if the apology did not come he would shoot himself. It was\r\na sort of Japanese duel. Alexander Alexándrovich sent no excuses, and\r\nthe officer kept his word. I saw him at the house of a warm friend\r\nof mine, his intimate friend, when he was expecting every minute to\r\nreceive the apology. Next morning he was dead. The Tsar was very angry\r\nwith his son, and ordered him to follow the hearse of the officer to\r\nthe grave. But even this terrible lesson did not cure the young man of\r\nhis Románoff haughtiness and impetuosity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART THIRD\r\n\r\nSIBERIA\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nIn the middle of May 1862, a few weeks before our promotion, I was told\r\none day by the Captain to make up the final list of the regiments which\r\neach of us intended to join. We had the choice of all the regiments of\r\nthe Guards, which we could enter with the first officer’s grade, and of\r\nthe Army with the third grade of lieutenant. I took a list of our form,\r\nand went the round of my comrades. Everyone knew well the regiment\r\nhe was going to join, most of them already wearing in the garden the\r\nofficer’s cap of that regiment.\r\n\r\n‘Her Majesty’s Cuirassiers,’ ‘The Body Guard Preobrazhénsky,’ ‘The\r\nHorse Guards,’ were the replies which I inscribed in my list.\r\n\r\n‘But you, Kropótkin? The artillery? The Cossacks?’ I was asked on all\r\nsides. I could not stand these questions, and at last, asking a comrade\r\nto complete the list, I went to my room to think once more over my\r\nfinal decision.\r\n\r\nThat I should not enter a regiment of the Guard, and give my life to\r\nparades and court balls, I had settled long before. My dream was to\r\nenter the university--to study, to live the student’s life. That meant,\r\nof course, to break entirely with my father, whose ambitions were quite\r\ndifferent, and to rely for my living upon what I might earn by means\r\nof lessons. Thousands of Russian students live in that way, and such a\r\nlife did not frighten me in the least. But--how should I get over the\r\nfirst steps in that life? In a few weeks I should have to leave the\r\nschool, to don my own clothes, to have my own lodging, and I saw no\r\npossibility of providing even the little money which would be required\r\nfor the most modest start. Then, failing the university, I had been\r\noften thinking of late that I could enter the Artillery Academy. That\r\nwould free me for two years from the drudgery of military service, and\r\nby the side of the military sciences I could study mathematics and\r\nphysics. But the wind of reaction was blowing, and the officers of the\r\nacademies had been treated during the previous winter as if they were\r\nschoolboys; in two academies they had revolted, and in one of them they\r\nhad left in a body.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts turned more and more toward Siberia. The Amúr region had\r\nrecently been annexed by Russia; I had read all about that Mississippi\r\nof the East, the mountains it pierces, the sub-tropical vegetation of\r\nits tributary, the Usurí, and my thoughts went further--to the tropical\r\nregions which Humboldt had described, and to the great generalizations\r\nof Ritter, which I delighted to read. Besides, I reasoned, there is\r\nin Siberia an immense field for the application of the great reforms\r\nwhich have been made or are coming: the workers must be few there, and\r\nI shall find a field of action to my tastes. The worst would be that\r\nI should have to separate from my brother Alexander; but he had been\r\ncompelled to leave the university of Moscow after the last disorders,\r\nand in a year or two, I guessed (and guessed rightly), in one way\r\nor another we should be together. There remained only the choice of\r\nthe regiment in the Amúr region. The Usurí attracted me most; but,\r\nalas, there was on the Usurí only one regiment of infantry Cossacks.\r\nA Cossack not on horseback--that was too bad for the boy that I still\r\nwas, and I settled upon ‘the mounted Cossacks of the Amúr.’\r\n\r\nThis I wrote on the list, to the great consternation of all my\r\ncomrades. ‘It is so far,’ they said, while my friend Daúroff, seizing\r\nthe Officers’ Handbook, read out of it, to the horror of all present:\r\n‘Uniform, black, with a plain red collar without braids; fur bonnet\r\nmade of dog’s fur or any other fur; trousers, gray.’\r\n\r\n‘Only look at that uniform!’ he exclaimed. ‘Bother the cap!--you can\r\nwear one of wolf or bear fur; but think only of the trousers! Gray,\r\nlike a soldier of the Train!’ The consternation reached its climax\r\nafter that reading.\r\n\r\nI joked as best I could, and took the list to the captain.\r\n\r\n‘Kropótkin must always have his joke!’ he cried. ‘Did I not tell you\r\nthat the list must be sent to the grand duke to-day?’\r\n\r\nI had some difficulty in making him believe that the list really stated\r\nmy intention.\r\n\r\nHowever, next day my resolution almost gave way when I saw how\r\nKlasóvsky took my decision. He had hoped to see me in the university,\r\nand had given me lessons in Latin and Greek for that purpose; and I\r\ndid not dare to tell him what really prevented me from entering the\r\nuniversity: I knew that if I told him the truth he would offer to share\r\nwith me the little that he had.\r\n\r\nThen my father telegraphed to the director that he forbade my going to\r\nSiberia, and the matter was reported to the grand duke, who was the\r\nchief of the military schools. I was called before his assistant, and\r\ntalked about the vegetation of the Amúr and like things, because I\r\nhad strong reasons for believing that if I said I wanted to go to the\r\nuniversity and could not afford it, a bursary would be offered to me by\r\nsome one of the imperial family--an offer which by all means I wished\r\nto avoid.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to say how all this would have ended, but an event of\r\nmuch importance--the great fire at St. Petersburg--brought about in an\r\nindirect way a solution to my difficulties.\r\n\r\nOn the Monday after Trinity--the day of the Holy Ghost, which was\r\nthat year on May 26, O.S.--a terrible fire broke out in the so-called\r\nApráxin Dvor. The Apráxin Dvor was an immense space, nearly half a mile\r\nsquare, which was entirely covered with small shops--mere shanties of\r\nwood--where all sorts of second- and third-hand goods were sold. Old\r\nfurniture and bedding, second-hand dresses and books, poured in from\r\nevery quarter of the city, and were stored in the small shanties, in\r\nthe passages between them, and even on their roofs. This accumulation\r\nof inflammable materials had at its back the Ministry of the Interior\r\nand its archives, where all the documents concerning the liberation\r\nof the serfs were kept; and in the front of it, which was lined by a\r\nrow of shops built of stone, was the State Bank. A narrow lane, also\r\nbordered with stone shops, separated the Apráxin Dvor from a wing of\r\nthe Corps of Pages, which was occupied by grocery and oil shops in\r\nits lower story and with the apartments of the officers in its upper\r\nstory. Almost opposite the Ministry of the Interior, on the other side\r\nof a canal, there were extensive timber yards. This labyrinth of small\r\nshanties and the timber yards opposite took fire almost at the same\r\nmoment, at four o’clock in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nIf there had been wind on that day, half the city would have perished\r\nin the flames, including the Bank, several Ministries, the Gostínoi\r\nDvor (another great block of shops on the Nevsky Perspective), the\r\nCorps of Pages, and the National Library.\r\n\r\nI was that afternoon at the Corps, dining at the house of one of our\r\nofficers, and we dashed to the spot as soon as we noticed from the\r\nwindows the first clouds of smoke rising in our close neighbourhood.\r\nThe sight was terrific. Like an immense snake, rattling and whistling,\r\nthe fire threw itself in all directions, right and left, enveloped the\r\nshanties, and suddenly rose in a huge column, darting out its whistling\r\ntongues to lick up more shanties with their contents. Whirlwinds of\r\nsmoke and fire were formed; and when the whirls of burning feathers\r\nfrom the bedding shops began to sweep about the space, it became\r\nimpossible to remain any longer inside the burning market. The whole\r\nhad to be abandoned.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe authorities had entirely lost their heads. There was not, at that\r\ntime, a single steam fire-engine in St. Petersburg, and it was workmen\r\nwho suggested bringing one from the iron works of Kólpino, situated\r\ntwenty miles by rail from the capital. When the engine reached the\r\nrailway station, it was the people who dragged it to the conflagration.\r\nOf its four lines of hose, one was damaged by an unknown hand, and the\r\nother three were directed upon the Ministry of the Interior.\r\n\r\nThe grand dukes came to the spot and went away again. Late in the\r\nevening, when the Bank was out of danger, the emperor also made his\r\nappearance, and said, what everyone knew already, that the Corps of\r\nPages was now the key of the battle, and must be saved by all means. It\r\nwas evident that if the Corps had taken fire, the National Library and\r\nhalf of the Nevsky Perspective would have perished in the flames.\r\n\r\nIt was the crowd, the people, who did everything to prevent the fire\r\nfrom spreading further and further. There was a moment when the Bank\r\nwas seriously menaced. The goods cleared from the shops opposite\r\nwere thrown into the Sadóvaya street, and lay in great heaps upon\r\nthe walls of the left wing of the Bank. The articles which covered\r\nthe street itself continually took fire, but the people, roasting\r\nthere in an almost unbearable heat, prevented the flames from being\r\ncommunicated to the piles of goods on the other side. They swore at\r\nall the authorities, seeing that there was not a pump on the spot.\r\n‘What are they all doing at the Ministry of the Interior, when the Bank\r\nand the Foundlings’ House are going to take fire? They have all lost\r\ntheir heads! Where is the chief of police that he cannot send a fire\r\nbrigade to the Bank?’ they said. I knew the chief, General Annenkoff,\r\npersonally, as I had met him once or twice at our sub-inspector’s\r\nhouse, whereto he came with his brother the well-known literary\r\ncritic, and I volunteered to find him. I found him, indeed, walking\r\naimlessly in a street; and when I reported to him the state of affairs,\r\nincredible though it may seem, it was to me, a boy, that he gave the\r\norder to move one of the fire brigades from the Ministry to the Bank.\r\nI exclaimed, of course, that the men would never listen to me, and I\r\nasked for a written order; but General Annenkoff had not, or pretended\r\nnot to have, a scrap of paper, so that I asked one of our officers, L.\r\nL. Gosse, to come with me to transmit the order. We at last prevailed\r\nupon the captain of one fire brigade--who swore at all the world and at\r\nhis chiefs--to move his men and engines to the Bank.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry itself was not on fire; it was the archives which were\r\nburning, and many boys, chiefly cadets and pages, together with a\r\nnumber of clerks, carried bundles of papers out of the burning building\r\nand loaded them into cabs. Often a bundle would fall out, and the wind,\r\ntaking possession of its leaves, would strew them about the square.\r\nThrough the smoke a sinister fire could be seen raging in the timber\r\nyards on the other side of the canal.\r\n\r\nThe narrow lane which separated the Corps of Pages from the Apráxin\r\nDvor was in a deplorable state. The shops which lined it were full of\r\nbrimstone, oil, turpentine, and the like, and immense tongues of fire\r\nof many hues, thrown out by explosions, licked the roofs of the wing\r\nof the Corps, which bordered the lane on its other side. The windows\r\nand the pilasters under the roof began already to smoulder, while\r\nthe pages and some cadets, after having cleared the lodgings, pumped\r\nwater through a small fire engine, which received at long intervals\r\nscanty supplies from old-fashioned barrels, which had to be filled\r\nwith ladles. A couple of firemen who stood on the hot roof continually\r\nshouted out, ‘Water! Water!’ in tones which were heartrending. I could\r\nnot stand these cries, and rushed into the Sadóvaya street, where, by\r\nsheer force, I compelled the driver of one of the barrels belonging\r\nto a police fire brigade to enter our yard and to supply our pump\r\nwith water. But when I attempted to do the same once more, I met with\r\nan absolute refusal from the driver, ‘I shall be court-martialled,’\r\nhe said, ‘if I obey you.’ On all sides my comrades urged me, ‘Go and\r\nfind somebody--the chief of the police, the grand duke, anyone--and\r\ntell them that without water we shall have to abandon the Corps to the\r\nfire.’ ‘Ought we not to report to our director?’ somebody would remark.\r\n‘Bother the whole lot! you won’t find them with a lantern. Go and do it\r\nyourself.’\r\n\r\nI went once more in search of General Annenkoff, and was at last told\r\nthat he must be in the yard of the Bank. Several officers stood there,\r\nindeed, around a general in whom I recognized the Governor-General\r\nof St. Petersburg, Prince Suvóroff. The gate, however, was locked,\r\nand a Bank official who stood at it refused to let me in. I insisted,\r\nmenaced, and finally was admitted. Then I went straight up to Prince\r\nSuvóroff, who was writing a note on the shoulder of his aide-de-camp.\r\nWhen I reported to him the state of affairs, his first question was,\r\n‘Who has sent you?’ ‘Nobody--the comrades,’ was my reply. ‘So you\r\nsay the Corps will soon be on fire?’ ‘Yes.’ He started at once, and\r\nseizing in the street an empty hatbox, covered his head with it, in\r\norder to protect himself from the scorching heat that came from the\r\nburning shops of the Apráxin Dvor and ran full speed to the lane.\r\nEmpty barrels, straw, wooden boxes, and the like covered the lane,\r\nbetween the flames of the oil shops on the one side and the buildings\r\nof our Corps, of which the window frames and the pilasters were\r\nsmouldering, on the other side. Prince Suvóroff acted resolutely.\r\n‘There is a company of soldiers in your garden,’ he said to me: ‘take a\r\ndetachment and clear that lane--at once. A hose from the steam engine\r\nwill be brought here immediately. Keep it playing. I trust it to you\r\npersonally.’\r\n\r\nIt was not easy to move the soldiers out of our garden. They had\r\ncleared the barrels and boxes of their contents, and with their pockets\r\nfull of coffee, and with conical lumps of sugar concealed in their\r\n_képis_, they were enjoying the warm night under the trees, cracking\r\nnuts. No one cared to move till an officer interfered. The lane was\r\ncleared, and the pump kept going. The comrades were delighted, and\r\nevery twenty minutes we relieved the men who directed the jet of water,\r\nstanding by their side in an almost unbearable heat.\r\n\r\nAbout three or four in the morning it was evident that bounds had been\r\nput to the fire; the danger of its spreading to the Corps was over, and\r\nafter having quenched my thirst with half a dozen glasses of tea, in\r\na small ‘white inn’ which happened to be open, I fell, half dead from\r\nfatigue, on the first bed that I found unoccupied in the hospital of\r\nthe corps.\r\n\r\nNext morning I woke up early and went to see the site of the\r\nconflagration, when on my return to the corps I met the Grand Duke\r\nMichael, whom I accompanied, as was my duty, on his round. The pages,\r\nwith their faces quite black from the smoke, with swollen eyes and\r\ninflamed lids, some of them with their hair burned, raised their heads\r\nfrom the pillows. It was hard to recognize them. They were proud,\r\nthough, of feeling that they had not been merely ‘white hands,’ and had\r\nworked as hard as anyone else.\r\n\r\nThis visit of the grand duke settled my difficulties. He asked me why\r\ndid I conceive that fancy of going to the Amúr--whether I had friends\r\nthere? whether the Governor-General knew me? and, learning that I had\r\nno relatives in Siberia and knew nobody there, he exclaimed, ‘But how\r\nare you going, then? They may send you to a lonely Cossack village.\r\nWhat will you be doing there? I had better write about you to the\r\nGovernor-General, to recommend you.’\r\n\r\nAfter such an offer I was sure that my father’s objection would be\r\nremoved; and so it was. I was free to go to Siberia.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis great conflagration became a turning-point not only in the policy\r\nof Alexander II., but also in the history of Russia in that part of\r\nthe century. That it was not a mere accident was self-evident. Trinity\r\nand the day of the Holy Ghost are great holidays in Russia, and there\r\nwas nobody inside the market except a few watchmen; besides, the\r\nApráxin market and the timber yards took fire at the same time, and the\r\nconflagration at St. Petersburg was followed by similar disasters in\r\nseveral provincial towns. The fire was lit by somebody, but by whom?\r\nThis question remains unanswered to the present time.\r\n\r\nKatkóff, the ex-Whig, who was inspired with personal hatred of Hérzen,\r\nand especially of Bakúnin, with whom he had once to fight a duel,\r\non the very day after the fire accused the Poles and the Russian\r\nrevolutionists of being the cause of it; and that opinion prevailed at\r\nSt. Petersburg and Moscow.\r\n\r\nPoland was preparing then for the revolution which broke out in\r\nthe following January, and the secret revolutionary government had\r\nconcluded an alliance with the London refugees, and had its men in\r\nthe very heart of the St. Petersburg administration. Only a short\r\ntime after the conflagration occurred, the Lord Lieutenant of Poland,\r\nCount Lüders, was shot at by a Russian officer; and when the grand\r\nduke Constantine was nominated in his place (with intention, it was\r\nsaid, of making Poland a separate kingdom for Constantine) he also was\r\nimmediately shot at, on June 26. Similar attempts were made in August\r\nagainst the Marquis Wielepólsky, the Polish leader of the pro-Russian\r\nUnion party. Napoleon III. maintained among the Poles the hope of an\r\narmed intervention in favour of their independence. In such conditions,\r\njudging from the ordinary narrow military standpoint, to destroy the\r\nBank of Russia and several Ministries, and to spread a panic in the\r\ncapital might have been considered a good plan of warfare; but there\r\nnever was the slightest scrap of evidence forthcoming to support this\r\nhypothesis.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, the advanced parties in Russia saw that no hope\r\ncould any longer be placed in Alexander’s reformatory initiative: he\r\nwas clearly drifting into the reactionary camp. To men of forethought\r\nit was evident that the liberation of the serfs, under the conditions\r\nof redemption which were imposed upon them, meant their certain ruin,\r\nand revolutionary proclamations were issued in May at St. Petersburg\r\ncalling the people and the army to a general revolt, while the\r\neducated classes were asked to insist upon the necessity of a National\r\nConvention. Under such circumstances, to disorganize the machine of the\r\ngovernment might have entered into the plans of some revolutionists.\r\n\r\nFinally, the indefinite character of the emancipation had produced\r\na great deal of fermentation among the peasants, who constitute a\r\nconsiderable part of the population in all Russian cities; and through\r\nall the history of Russia, every time such a fermentation has begun it\r\nhas resulted in anonymous letters foretelling fires, and eventually in\r\nincendiarism.\r\n\r\nIt was possible that the idea of setting the Apráxin market on fire\r\nmight occur to isolated men in the revolutionary camp, but neither the\r\nmost searching inquiries nor the wholesale arrests which began all over\r\nRussia and Poland immediately after the fire revealed the slightest\r\nindication showing that such was really the case. If anything of the\r\nsort had been found, the reactionary party would have made capital\r\nout of it. Many reminiscences and volumes of correspondence from those\r\ntimes have since been published, but they contain no hint whatever in\r\nsupport of this suspicion.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, when similar conflagrations broke out in several towns\r\non the Vólga, and especially at Sarátoff, and when Zhdánoff, a member\r\nof the Senate, was sent by the Tsar to make a searching inquiry, he\r\nreturned with the firm conviction that the conflagration at Sarátoff\r\nwas the work of the reactionary party. There was among that party\r\na general belief that it would be possible to induce Alexander II.\r\nto postpone the final abolition of serfdom, which was to take place\r\non February 19, 1863. They knew the weakness of his character, and\r\nimmediately after the great fire at St. Petersburg they began a violent\r\ncampaign for postponement, and for the revision of the emancipation\r\nlaw in its practical applications. It was rumoured in well-informed\r\nlegal circles that Senator Zhdánoff was in fact returning with positive\r\nproofs of the culpability of the reactionaries at Sarátoff; but he died\r\non his way back, his portfolio disappeared, and it has never been found.\r\n\r\nBe it as it may, the Apráxin fire had the most deplorable consequences.\r\nAfter it Alexander II. surrendered to the reactionaries, and--what\r\nwas still worse--the public opinion of that part of society at St.\r\nPetersburg, and especially at Moscow, which carried most weight\r\nwith the government suddenly threw off its liberal garb, and turned\r\nagainst not only the more advanced section of the reform party, but\r\neven against its moderate wing. A few days after the conflagration I\r\nwent on Sunday to see my cousin, the aide-de-camp of the emperor, in\r\nwhose apartment I had often heard the Horse Guard officers expressing\r\nsympathy with Chernyshévsky; my cousin himself had been up till then\r\nan assiduous reader of ‘The Contemporary’ (the organ of the advanced\r\nreform party). Now he brought several numbers of ‘The Contemporary,’\r\nand, putting them on the table I was sitting at, said to me: ‘Well,\r\nnow, after this I will have no more of that incendiary stuff; enough\r\nof it’--and these words expressed the opinion of ‘all St. Petersburg.’\r\nIt became improper to talk of reforms. The whole atmosphere was laden\r\nwith a reactionary spirit. ‘The Contemporary’ and other similar reviews\r\nwere suppressed; the Sunday schools were prohibited under any form;\r\nwholesale arrests began. The capital was placed under a state of siege.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA fortnight later, on June 13 (25), the time which we pages and\r\ncadets had so long looked for came at last. The emperor gave us a\r\nsort of military examination in all kinds of evolutions--during\r\nwhich we commanded the companies and I paraded on a horse before the\r\nbattalion--and we were promoted to be officers.\r\n\r\nWhen the parade was over, Alexander II. loudly called out, ‘The\r\npromoted officers to me!’ and we gathered round him. He remained on\r\nhorseback.\r\n\r\nHere I saw him in a quite new light. The man who the next year appeared\r\nin the _rôle_ of a bloodthirsty and vindictive suppressor of the\r\ninsurrection in Poland rose now, full size, before my eyes, in the\r\nspeech he addressed to us.\r\n\r\nHe began in a quiet tone. ‘I congratulate you: you are officers.’ He\r\nspoke about military duty and loyalty as they are usually spoken of on\r\nsuch occasions. ‘But if any one of you,’ he went on, distinctly shouting\r\nout every word, his face suddenly contorted with anger, ‘but if any one\r\nof you--which God preserve you from--should under any circumstances\r\nprove disloyal to the Tsar, the throne, and the fatherland--take heed\r\nof what I say--he will be treated with all the se-ve-ri-ty of the laws,\r\nwithout the slightest com-mi-se-ra-tion!’\r\n\r\nHis voice failed; his face was peevish, full of that expression of\r\nblind rage which I saw in my childhood on the faces of landlords when\r\nthey threatened their serfs ‘to skin them under the rods.’ He violently\r\nspurred his horse, and rode out of our circle. Next morning, June 14,\r\nby his orders three officers were shot at Módlin in Poland, and one\r\nsoldier, Szur by name, was killed under the rods.\r\n\r\n‘Reaction, full speed backwards,’ I said to myself as we made our way\r\nback to the corps.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI saw Alexander II. once more before leaving St. Petersburg. Some\r\ndays after our promotion, all the newly appointed officers were at\r\nthe palace, to be presented to him. My more than modest uniform, with\r\nits prominent gray trousers, attracted universal attention, and every\r\nmoment I had to satisfy the curiosity of officers of all ranks, who\r\ncame to ask me what was the uniform that I wore. The Amúr Cossacks\r\nbeing then the youngest regiment of the Russian army, I stood somewhere\r\nnear the end of the hundreds of officers who were present. Alexander\r\nII. found me and asked, ‘So you go to Siberia? Did your father consent\r\nto it, after all?’ I answered in the affirmative. ‘Are you not afraid\r\nto go so far?’ I warmly replied: ‘No, I want to work. There must be so\r\nmuch to do in Siberia to apply the great reforms which are going to be\r\nmade.’ He looked straight at me; he became pensive; at last he said,\r\n‘Well, go; one can be useful everywhere;’ and his face took on such an\r\nexpression of fatigue, such a character of complete surrender, that I\r\nthought at once, ‘He is a used-up man; he is going to give it all up.’\r\n\r\nSt. Petersburg had assumed a gloomy aspect. Soldiers marched in the\r\nstreets. Cossack patrols rode round the palace, the fortress was filled\r\nwith prisoners. Wherever I went I saw the same thing--the triumph of\r\nthe reaction. I left St. Petersburg without regret.\r\n\r\nI went every day to the Cossack administration to ask them to make\r\nhaste and deliver me my papers, and as soon as they were ready I\r\nhurried to Moscow to join my brother Alexander.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe five years that I spent in Siberia were for me a genuine education\r\nin life and human character. I was brought into contact with men of all\r\ndescriptions: the best and the worst; those who stood at the top of\r\nsociety and those who vegetated at the very bottom--the tramps and the\r\nso-called incorrigible criminals. I had ample opportunities to watch\r\nthe ways and habits of the peasants in their daily life, and still more\r\nopportunities to appreciate how little the State administration could\r\ngive to them, even if it were animated by the very best intentions.\r\nFinally, my extensive journeys, during which I travelled over fifty\r\nthousand miles in carts, on board steamers, in boats, but chiefly on\r\nhorseback, had a wonderful effect in strengthening my health. They also\r\ntaught me how little man really needs as soon as he comes out of the\r\nenchanted circle of conventional civilization. With a few pounds of\r\nbread and a few ounces of tea in a leather bag, a kettle and a hatchet\r\nhanging at the side of the saddle, and under the saddle a blanket, to\r\nbe spread at the camp fire upon a bed of freshly cut spruce twigs,\r\na man feels wonderfully independent, even amidst unknown mountains\r\nthickly clothed with woods or capped with snow. A book might be written\r\nabout this part of my life, but I must rapidly glide over it here,\r\nthere being so much more to say about the later periods.\r\n\r\nSiberia is not the frozen land buried in snow and peopled with exiles\r\nonly that it is imagined to be, even by many Russians. In its southern\r\nparts it is as rich in natural productions as are the southern parts\r\nof Canada, which it resembles very much in its physical aspects; and\r\nbeside half a million of natives, it has a population of more than\r\nfour millions of Russians. The southern parts of West Siberia are as\r\nthoroughly Russian as the provinces to the north of Moscow.\r\n\r\nIn 1862 the upper administration of Siberia was far more enlightened\r\nand far better all round than that of any province of Russia proper.\r\nFor several years the post of Governor-General of East Siberia had\r\nbeen occupied by a remarkable personage, Count N. N. Muravióff, who\r\nannexed the Amúr region to Russia. He was very intelligent, very\r\nactive, extremely amiable, and desirous to work for the good of the\r\ncountry. Like all men of action of the governmental school, he was\r\na despot at the bottom of his heart; but he held advanced opinions,\r\nand a democratic republic would not have quite satisfied him. He had\r\nsucceeded to a great extent in getting rid of the old staff of civil\r\nservice officials, who considered Siberia a camp to be plundered, and\r\nhe had gathered around him a number of young officials, quite honest,\r\nand many of them animated by the same excellent intentions as himself.\r\nIn his own study, the young officers, with the exile Bakúnin among them\r\n(he escaped from Siberia in the autumn of 1861), discussed the chances\r\nof creating the United States of Siberia, federated across the Pacific\r\nOcean with the United States of America.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen I came to Irkútsk, the capital of East Siberia, the wave of\r\nreaction which I saw rising at St. Petersburg had not yet reached\r\nthese distant dominions. I was very well received by the young\r\nGovernor-General, Korsákoff, who had just succeeded Muravióff, and\r\nhe told me that he was delighted to have about him men of liberal\r\nopinions. As to the commander of the General Staff, Kúkel--a young\r\ngeneral not yet thirty-five years old, whose personal aide-de-camp\r\nI became--he at once took me to a room in his house, where I found,\r\ntogether with the best Russian reviews, complete collections of the\r\nLondon revolutionary editions of Hérzen. We were soon warm friends.\r\n\r\nGeneral Kúkel temporarily occupied at that time the post of Governor\r\nof Transbaikália, and a few weeks later we crossed the beautiful\r\nLake Baikál and went further east, to the little town of Chitá, the\r\ncapital of the province. There I had to give myself, heart and soul,\r\nwithout loss of time, to the great reforms which were then under\r\ndiscussion. The St. Petersburg Ministries had applied to the local\r\nauthorities, asking them to work out schemes of complete reform in the\r\nadministration of the provinces, the organization of the police, the\r\ntribunals, the prisons, the system of exile, the self-government of the\r\ntownships--all on broadly liberal bases laid down by the emperor in his\r\nmanifestoes.\r\n\r\nKúkel, supported by an intelligent and practical man, Colonel\r\nPedashénko, and by a couple of well-meaning civil service officials,\r\nworked all day long, and often a good deal of the night. I became\r\nthe secretary of two committees--for the reform of the prisons and\r\nthe whole system of exile, and for preparing a scheme of municipal\r\nself-government--and I set to work with all the enthusiasm of a youth\r\nof nineteen years. I read much about the historical development of\r\nthese institutions in Russia and their present condition abroad,\r\nexcellent works and papers dealing with these subjects having been\r\npublished by the Ministries of the Interior and of Justice; but what we\r\ndid in Transbaikália was by no means merely theoretical. I discussed\r\nfirst the general outlines, and subsequently every point of detail,\r\nwith practical men, well acquainted with the real needs and the local\r\npossibilities; and for that purpose I met a considerable number of men\r\nboth in town and in the province. Then the conclusions we arrived at\r\nwere re-discussed with Kúkel and Pedashénko; and when I had put the\r\nresults into a preliminary shape, every point was again very thoroughly\r\nthrashed out in the committees. One of these committees, for preparing\r\nthe municipal government scheme, was composed of citizens of Chitá,\r\nelected by all the population, as freely as they might have been\r\nelected in the United States. In short, our work was very serious; and\r\neven now, looking back at it through the perspective of so many years,\r\nI can say in full confidence that if municipal self-government had been\r\ngranted then, in the modest shape which we gave to it, the towns of\r\nSiberia would be very different from what they are. But nothing came of\r\nit all, as will presently be seen.\r\n\r\nThere was no lack of other incidental occupations. Money had to\r\nbe found for the support of charitable institutions; an economic\r\ndescription of the province had to be written in connection with a\r\nlocal agricultural exhibition; or some serious inquiry had to be made.\r\n‘It is a great epoch we live in; work, my dear friend; remember that\r\nyou are the secretary of all existing and future committees’, Kúkel\r\nwould sometimes say to me,--and I worked with doubled energy.\r\n\r\nOne example or two will show with what results. There was in our\r\nprovince a ‘district chief’--that is, a police officer invested with\r\nvery wide and indeterminate rights--who was simply a disgrace. He\r\nrobbed the peasants and flogged them right and left--even women, which\r\nwas against the law; and when a criminal affair fell into his hands, it\r\nmight lie there for months, men being kept in the meantime in prison\r\ntill they gave him a bribe. Kúkel would have dismissed this man long\r\nbefore, but the Governor-General did not like the idea of it, because\r\nhe had strong protectors at St. Petersburg. After much hesitation, it\r\nwas decided at last that I should go to make an investigation on the\r\nspot, and collect evidence against the man. This was not by any means\r\neasy, because the peasants, terrorized by him, and well knowing an old\r\nRussian saying, ‘God is far away, while your chief is your next-door\r\nneighbour,’ did not dare to testify. Even the woman he had flogged was\r\nafraid at first to make a written statement. It was only after I had\r\nstayed a fortnight with the peasants, and had won their confidence,\r\nthat the misdeeds of their chief could be brought to light. I\r\ncollected crushing evidence, and the district chief was dismissed. We\r\ncongratulated ourselves on having got rid of such a pest. What was,\r\nhowever, our astonishment when, a few months later, we learned that\r\nthis same man had been nominated to a higher post in Kamchátka! There\r\nhe could plunder the natives free of any control, and so he did. A few\r\nyears later he returned to St. Petersburg a rich man. The articles he\r\noccasionally contributes now to the reactionary press are, as one might\r\nexpect, full of high ‘patriotic’ spirit.\r\n\r\nThe wave of reaction, as I have already said, had not then reached\r\nSiberia, and the political exiles continued to be treated with\r\nall possible leniency, as in Muravióff’s time. When, in 1861, the\r\npoet Mikháiloff was condemned to hard labour for a revolutionary\r\nproclamation which he had issued, and was sent to Siberia, the Governor\r\nof the first Siberian town on his way, Tobólsk, gave a dinner in his\r\nhonour, in which all the officials took part. In Transbaikália he\r\nwas not kept at hard labour, but was allowed officially to stay in\r\nthe hospital prison of a small mining village. His health being very\r\npoor--he was dying from consumption, and did actually die a few months\r\nlater--General Kúkel gave him permission to stay in the house of his\r\nbrother, a mining engineer, who had rented a gold mine from the Crown\r\non his own account. Unofficially that was well known in East Siberia.\r\nBut one day we learned from Irkútsk that, in consequence of a secret\r\ndenunciation, a General of the gendarmes (state police) was on his way\r\nto Chitá to make a strict inquiry into the affair. An aide-de-camp of\r\nthe Governor-General brought us the news. I was despatched in great\r\nhaste to warn Mikháiloff, and to tell him that he must return at once\r\nto the hospital prison, while the General of the gendarmes was kept\r\nat Chitá. As that gentleman found himself every night the winner of\r\nconsiderable sums of money at the green table in Kúkel’s house, he soon\r\ndecided not to exchange this pleasant pastime for a long journey to\r\nthe mines in a temperature which was then a dozen degrees below the\r\nfreezing-point of mercury, and eventually went back to Irkútsk quite\r\nsatisfied with his lucrative mission.\r\n\r\nThe storm, however, was coming nearer and nearer, and it swept\r\neverything before it soon after the insurrection broke out in Poland.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nIn January 1863 Poland rose against Russian rule. Insurrectionary bands\r\nwere formed, and a war began which lasted for full eighteen months. The\r\nLondon refugees had implored the Polish revolutionary committees to\r\npostpone the movement. They foresaw that it would be crushed, and would\r\nput an end to the reform period in Russia. But it could not be helped.\r\nThe repression of the nationalist manifestations which took place\r\nat Warsaw in 1861, and the cruel, quite unprovoked executions which\r\nfollowed, exasperated the Poles. The die was cast.\r\n\r\nNever before had the Polish cause so many sympathizers in Russia as\r\nat that time. I do not speak of the revolutionists; but even among\r\nthe more moderate elements of Russian society it was thought, and was\r\nopenly said, that it would be a benefit for Russia to have in Poland a\r\nfriendly neighbour instead of a hostile subject. Poland will never lose\r\nher national character, it is too strongly developed; she has, and will\r\nhave, her own literature, her own art and industry. Russia can keep her\r\nin servitude only by means of sheer force and oppression--a condition\r\nof things which has hitherto favoured, and necessarily will favour,\r\noppression in Russia herself. Even the peaceful Slavophiles were of\r\nthat opinion; and while I was at school St. Petersburg society greeted\r\nwith full approval the ‘dream’ which the Slavophile Iván Aksákoff had\r\nthe courage to print in his paper, ‘The Day.’ His dream was that the\r\nRussian troops had evacuated Poland, and he discussed the excellent\r\nresults which would follow.\r\n\r\nWhen the revolution of 1863 broke out, several Russian officers\r\nrefused to march against the Poles, while others openly took their\r\npart, and died either on the scaffold or on the battlefield. Funds\r\nfor the insurrection were collected all over Russia--quite openly in\r\nSiberia--and in the Russian universities the students equipped those of\r\ntheir comrades who were going to join the revolutionists.\r\n\r\nThen, amidst this effervescence, the news spread over Russia that\r\nduring the night of January 10 bands of insurgents had fallen upon\r\nthe soldiers who were cantoned in the villages, and had murdered them\r\nin their beds, although on the very eve of that day the relations of\r\nthe troops with the Poles seemed to be quite friendly. There was some\r\nexaggeration in the report, but unfortunately there was also truth in\r\nit, and the impression it produced in Russia was most disastrous. The\r\nold antipathies between the two nations, so akin in their origins but\r\nso different in their national characters, woke up once more.\r\n\r\nGradually the bad feeling faded away to some extent. The gallant fight\r\nof the always brave sons of Poland, and the indomitable energy with\r\nwhich they resisted a formidable army, won sympathy for that heroic\r\nnation. But it became known that the Polish revolutionary committee, in\r\nits demand for the re-establishment of Poland with its old frontiers,\r\nincluded the Little Russian or Ukraínian provinces, the Greek Orthodox\r\npopulation of which hated their Polish rulers, and more than once in\r\nthe course of the last three centuries slaughtered them wholesale.\r\nMoreover, Napoleon III. began to menace Russia with a new war--a vain\r\nmenace, which did more harm to the Poles than all other things put\r\ntogether. And finally, the radical elements of Russia saw with regret\r\nthat now the purely nationalist elements of Poland had got the upper\r\nhand, the revolutionary government did not care in the least to grant\r\nthe land to the serfs--a blunder of which the Russian government did\r\nnot fail to take advantage, in order to appear in the position of\r\nprotector of the peasants against their Polish landlords.\r\n\r\nWhen the revolution broke out in Poland it was generally believed in\r\nRussia that it would take a democratic, republican turn; and that the\r\nliberation of the serfs on a broad democratic basis would be the first\r\nthing which a revolutionary government, fighting for the independence\r\nof the country, would accomplish.\r\n\r\nThe Emancipation Law, as it had been enacted at St. Petersburg in\r\n1861, provided ample opportunity for such a course of action. The\r\npersonal obligations of the serfs towards their owners only came to\r\nan end on February 19, 1863. Then a very slow process had to be gone\r\nthrough in order to obtain a sort of agreement between the landlords\r\nand the serfs as to the size and the locality of the land allotments\r\nwhich were to be given to the liberated serfs. The yearly payments\r\nfor these allotments (disproportionately high) were fixed by law at\r\nso much per acre; but the peasants had also to pay an additional sum\r\nfor their homesteads, and of this sum the maximum only had been fixed\r\nby the statute--it having been thought that the landlords might be\r\ninduced to forgo that additional payment, or to be satisfied with only\r\na part of it. As to the so-called ‘redemption’ of the land--in which\r\ncase the Government undertook to pay the landlord its full value in\r\nState bonds and the peasants receiving the land had to pay in return,\r\nfor forty-nine years, six per cent. on that sum as interest and\r\nannuities--not only were these payments extravagant and ruinous for\r\nthe peasants, but no term was even fixed for the redemption: it was\r\nleft to the will of the landlord; and in an immense number of cases the\r\nredemption arrangements had not been entered upon twenty years after\r\nthe emancipation.\r\n\r\nUnder such conditions a revolutionary government had ample opportunity\r\nfor immensely improving upon the Russian law. It was bound to\r\naccomplish an act of justice towards the serfs--whose condition in\r\nPoland was as bad as, and often worse than, in Russia itself--by\r\ngranting them better and more definite conditions of emancipation. But\r\nnothing of the sort was done. The purely nationalist party and the\r\naristocratic one having obtained the upper hand in the movement, this\r\nall-absorbing matter was left out of sight. It was thus easy for the\r\nRussian Government to win the peasants to its side.\r\n\r\nFull advantage was taken of this fault when Nicholas Milútin was sent\r\nto Poland by Alexander II. with the mission to liberate the peasants in\r\nthe way he intended doing it in Russia. ‘Go to Poland; apply there your\r\nRed programme against the Polish landlords,’ said Alexander II. to him;\r\nand Milútin, together with Prince Cherkássky and many others, really\r\ndid their best to take the land from the landlords and give full-sized\r\nallotments to the peasants.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI once met one of the Russian functionaries who went to Poland under\r\nMilútin and Prince Cherkássky. ‘We had full liberty,’ he said to me,\r\n‘to hold out the hand to the peasants. My usual plan was to go to a\r\nvillage and convoke the peasants’ assembly. “Tell me first,” I would\r\nsay, “what land do you hold at this moment?” They would point it out\r\nto me. “Is this all the land you ever held?” I would then ask. “Surely\r\nnot,” they would reply with one voice; “years ago these meadows were\r\nours; this wood was once in our possession; and these fields belonged\r\nto us.” I would let them go on talking it all over, and then would\r\nask: “Now, which of you can certify under oath that this land or that\r\nland has ever been held by you?” Of course there would be nobody\r\nforthcoming--it was all too long ago. At last, some old man would be\r\nthrust out from the crowd, the rest saying: “He knows all about it, he\r\ncan swear to it.” The old man would begin a long story about what he\r\nknew in his youth, or had heard from his father, but I would cut the\r\nstory short.... “State on oath what you know to have been held by the\r\n_gmina_ (the village community)--and the land is yours.” And as soon\r\nas he took the oath--one could trust that oath implicitly--I wrote out\r\nthe papers and declared to the assembly: “Now, this land is yours. You\r\nstand no longer under any obligations whatever to your late masters:\r\nyou are simply their neighbours; all you will have to do is to pay the\r\nredemption tax, so much every year, to the Government. Your homesteads\r\ngo with the land: you get them free.”’\r\n\r\nOne can imagine the effect which such a policy produced upon the\r\npeasants. A cousin of mine, Petr Nikoláevich, a brother of the\r\naide-de-camp whom I have mentioned, was in Poland or in Lithuania with\r\nhis regiment of uhlans of the Guard. The revolution was so serious\r\nthat even the regiments of the Guard had been sent against it from St.\r\nPetersburg; and it is now known that when Mikhael Muravióff was ordered\r\nto Lithuania, and came to take leave of the Empress Marie, she said to\r\nhim: ‘Save at least Lithuania for Russia.’ Poland was regarded as lost.\r\n\r\n‘The armed bands of the revolutionists held the country,’ my cousin\r\nsaid to me, ‘and we were powerless to defeat them, or even to find\r\nthem. Small bands over and over again attacked our small detachments,\r\nand as they fought admirably, and knew the country and found support\r\nin the population, they often had the best of the skirmishes. We were\r\nthus compelled to march in large columns only. We would cross a region,\r\nmarching through the woods without finding any trace of the bands;\r\nbut when we marched back again we learned that bands had appeared in\r\nour rear, that they had levied the patriotic tax in the country, and\r\nif some peasant had rendered himself useful in any way to our troops\r\nwe found him hanged on a tree by the revolutionary bands. So it went\r\non for months, with no chance of improvement, until Milútin came and\r\nfreed the peasants, giving them the land. Then--all was over. The\r\npeasants sided with us; they helped us to lay hold of the bands, and\r\nthe insurrection came to an end.’\r\n\r\nI often spoke with the Polish exiles in Siberia upon this subject,\r\nand some of them understood the fault that had been committed. A\r\nrevolution, from its very outset, must be an act of justice towards\r\nthe ‘down-trodden and the oppressed’--not a promise of making such\r\nreparation later on--otherwise it is sure to fail. Unfortunately,\r\nit often happens that the leaders are so much absorbed with mere\r\nquestions of military tactics that they forget the main thing. To be\r\nrevolutionists, and fail to prove to the masses that a new era has\r\nreally begun for them, is to ensure the certain ruin of the attempt.\r\n\r\nThe disastrous consequences for Poland of this revolution are known;\r\nthey belong to the domain of history. How many thousand men perished in\r\nbattle, how many hundreds were hanged, and how many scores of thousands\r\nwere transported to various provinces of Russia and Siberia, is not yet\r\nfully known. But even the official figures which were printed in Russia\r\na few years ago show that in the Lithuanian provinces alone--not to\r\nspeak of Poland proper--that terrible man Mikhael Muravióff, to whom\r\nthe Russian Government has just erected a monument at Wílno, hanged\r\nby his own authority 128 Poles, and transported to Russia and Siberia\r\n9,423 men and women. Officials lists, also published in Russia, give\r\n18,672 men and women exiled to Siberia from Poland, of whom 10,407 were\r\nsent to East Siberia. I remember that the Governor-General of East\r\nSiberia mentioned to me the same number, about 11,000 persons, sent to\r\nhard labour or exile in his domains. I saw them there, and witnessed\r\ntheir sufferings. Altogether, something like 60,000 or 70,000 persons,\r\nif not more, were torn out of Poland and transported to different\r\nprovinces of Russia, to the Urals, to Caucasus, and to Siberia.\r\n\r\nFor Russia the consequences were equally disastrous. The Polish\r\ninsurrection was the definitive close of the reform period. True, the\r\nlaw of provincial self-government (_Zémstvos_) and the reform of the\r\nlaw courts were promulgated in 1864 and 1866; but both were ready in\r\n1862, and, moreover, at the last moment Alexander II. gave preference\r\nto the scheme of self-government which had been prepared by the\r\nreactionary party of Valúeff, as against the scheme which had been\r\nprepared by Nicholas Milútin; and immediately after the promulgation of\r\nboth reforms their importance was reduced, and in some cases destroyed,\r\nby the enactment of a number of by-laws.\r\n\r\nWorst of all, public opinion itself took a further step backward. The\r\nhero of the hour was Katkóff, the leader of the serfdom party, who\r\nappeared now as a Russian ‘patriot,’ and carried with him most of the\r\nSt. Petersburg and Moscow society. After that time, those who dared\r\nto speak of reforms were at once classed by Katkóff as ‘traitors to\r\nRussia.’\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe wave of reaction soon reached our remote province. One day in March\r\na paper was brought by a special messenger from Irkútsk. It intimated\r\nto General Kúkel that he was at once to leave the post of Governor of\r\nTransbaikália and go to Irkútsk, waiting there for further orders, but\r\nwithout reassuming there the post of commander of the general staff.\r\n\r\nWhy? What did that mean? There was not a word of explanation. Even the\r\nGovernor-General, a personal friend of Kúkel, had not run the risk of\r\nadding a single word to the mysterious order. Did it mean that Kúkel\r\nwas going to be taken between two gendarmes to St. Petersburg, and\r\nimmured in that huge stone coffin, the fortress of St. Peter and St.\r\nPaul? All was possible. Later on we learned that such was indeed the\r\nintention; and so it would and have been done but for the energetic\r\nintervention of Count Nicholas Muravióff, ‘the conqueror of the Amúr,’\r\nwho personally implored the Tsar that Kúkel should be spared that fate.\r\n\r\nOur parting with Kúkel and his charming family was like a funeral. My\r\nheart was very heavy. I not only lost in him a dear personal friend,\r\nbut I felt also that this parting was the burial of a whole epoch, full\r\nof long-cherished hopes--‘full of illusions,’ as it became the fashion\r\nto say.\r\n\r\nSo it was. A new Governor came--a good-natured, ‘leave-me-in-peace’\r\nman. With renewed energy, seeing that there was no time to lose, I\r\ncompleted our plans of reform of the system of exile and municipal\r\nself-government. The Governor made a few objections here and there for\r\nformality’s sake, but finally signed the schemes, and they were sent\r\nto headquarters. But at St. Petersburg reforms were no longer wanted.\r\nThere our projects lie buried still, with hundreds of similar ones\r\nfrom all parts of Russia. A few ‘improved’ prisons, even more terrible\r\nthan the old unimproved ones, have been built in the capitals, to be\r\nshown during prison congresses to distinguished foreigners; but the\r\nremainder, and the whole system of exile, were found by George Kennan\r\nin 1886 in exactly the same state in which I left them in 1862. Only\r\nnow, after thirty-six years have passed away, the authorities are\r\nintroducing the reformed tribunals and a parody of self-government in\r\nSiberia, and committees have been nominated again to inquire into the\r\nsystem of exile.\r\n\r\nWhen Kennan came back to London from his journey to Siberia he managed,\r\non the very next day after his arrival in London, to hunt up Stepniák,\r\nTchaykóvsky, myself, and another Russian refugee. In the evening we\r\nall met at Kennan’s room in a small hotel near Charing Cross. We\r\nsaw him for the first time, and having no excess of confidence in\r\nenterprising Englishmen who had previously undertaken to learn all\r\nabout the Siberian prisons without even learning a word of Russian, we\r\nbegan to cross-examine Kennan. To our astonishment, he not only spoke\r\nexcellent Russian, but he knew everything worth knowing about Siberia.\r\nOne or another of us had been acquainted with the greater proportion of\r\nall political exiles in Siberia, and we besieged Kennan with questions:\r\n‘Where is So-and-So? Is he married? Is he happy in his marriage? Does\r\nhe still keep fresh in spirit?’ We were soon satisfied that Kennan knew\r\nall about every one of them.\r\n\r\nWhen this questioning was over, and we were preparing to leave, I\r\nasked, ‘Do you know, Mr. Kennan, if they have built a watchtower for\r\nthe fire brigade at Chitá?’ Stepniák looked at me, as if to reproach me\r\nfor abusing Kennan’s good-will. Kennan, however, began to laugh, and I\r\nsoon joined him. And with much laughter we tossed each other questions\r\nand answers: ‘Why, do you know about that?’ ‘And you too?’ ‘Built?’\r\n‘Yes, double estimates!’ and so on, till at last Stepniák interfered,\r\nand in his most severely good-natured way objected: ‘Tell us at least\r\nwhat you are laughing about.’ Whereupon Kennan told the story of that\r\nwatchtower which his readers must remember. In 1859 the Chitá people\r\nwanted to build a watchtower, and collected the money for it; but their\r\nestimates had to be sent to the Ministry of the Interior. So they went\r\nto St. Petersburg; but when they came back, two years later, duly\r\napproved, all the prices for timber and work had gone up in that rising\r\nyoung town. This was in 1862, while I was at Chitá. New estimates were\r\nmade and sent to St. Petersburg, and the story was repeated for full\r\ntwenty-five years, till at last the Chitá people, losing patience, put\r\nin their estimates prices nearly double the real ones. These fantastic\r\nestimates were solemnly considered at St. Petersburg, and approved.\r\nThis is how Chitá got its watchtower.\r\n\r\nIt has often been said that Alexander II. committed a great fault,\r\nand brought about his own ruin, by raising so many hopes which later\r\non he did not satisfy. It is seen from what I have just said--and\r\nthe story of little Chitá was the story of all Russia--that he did\r\nworse than that. It was not merely that he raised hopes. Yielding\r\nfor a moment to the current of public opinion around him, he induced\r\nmen all over Russia to set to work, to issue from the domain of mere\r\nhopes and dreams, and to touch with the finger the reforms that were\r\nrequired. He made them realize what could be done immediately, and how\r\neasy it was to do it; he induced them to sacrifice whatever of their\r\nideals could not be immediately realized, and to demand only what was\r\npractically possible at the time. And when they had framed their ideas,\r\nand had shaped them into laws which merely required his signature to\r\nbecome realities, then he refused that signature. No reactionist could\r\nraise, or ever has raised, his voice to assert that what was left--the\r\nunreformed tribunals, the absence of municipal government, or the\r\nsystem of exile--was good and was worth maintaining: no one has dared\r\nto say that. And yet, owing to the fear of doing anything, all was\r\nleft as it was; for thirty-five years those who ventured to mention\r\nthe necessity of a change were treated as ‘suspects;’ and institutions\r\nunanimously recognized as bad were permitted to continue in existence\r\nonly that nothing more might be heard of that abhorred word ‘reform.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nSeeing that there was nothing more to be done at Chitá in the way of\r\nreforms, I gladly accepted the offer to visit the Amúr that same summer\r\nof 1863.\r\n\r\nThe immense domain on the left (northern) bank of the Amúr, and\r\nalong the Pacific Coast as far south as the Bay of Peter the Great\r\n(Vladivostók), had been annexed to Russia by Count Muravióff, almost\r\nagainst the will of the St. Petersburg authorities and certainly\r\nwithout much help from them. When he conceived the bold plan of taking\r\npossession of the great river whose southern position and fertile lands\r\nhad for the last two hundred years always attracted the Siberians; and\r\nwhen, on the eve of the opening of Japan to Europe, he decided to take\r\nfor Russia a strong position on the Pacific coast and to join hands\r\nwith the United States, he had almost everybody against him at St.\r\nPetersburg: the Ministry of War, which had no men to dispose of, the\r\nMinistry of Finance, which had no money for annexations, and especially\r\nthe Ministry of Foreign Affairs, always guided by its pre-occupation\r\nof avoiding ‘diplomatic complications.’ Muravióff had thus to act on\r\nhis own responsibility, and to rely upon the scanty means which thinly\r\npopulated Eastern Siberia could afford for this grand enterprise.\r\nMoreover, everything had to be done in a hurry, in order to oppose the\r\n‘accomplished fact’ to the protests of the West European diplomatists,\r\nwhich would certainly be raised.\r\n\r\nA nominal occupation would have been of no avail, and the idea was\r\nto have on the whole length of the great river and of its southern\r\ntributary, the Usurí--full 2,500 miles--a chain of self-supporting\r\nsettlements, and thus to establish a regular communication between\r\nSiberia and the Pacific Coast. Men were wanted for these settlements,\r\nand as the scanty population of East Siberia could not supply them,\r\nMuravióff did not recoil before any kind of means of getting men.\r\nReleased convicts who, after having served their time, had become serfs\r\nto the Imperial mines, were freed and organized as Transbaikálian\r\nCossacks, part of whom were settled along the Amúr and the Usurí,\r\nforming two new Cossack communities. Then Muravióff obtained the\r\nrelease of a thousand hard-labour convicts (mostly robbers and\r\nmurderers), who had to be settled as free men on the lower Amúr.\r\nHe came himself to see them off, and, as they were going to leave,\r\naddressed them on the beach: ‘Go, my children, be free there, cultivate\r\nthe land, make it Russian soil, start a new life,’ and so on. The\r\nRussian peasant women nearly always follow, of their own free will,\r\ntheir husbands if the latter happen to be sent to hard labour to\r\nSiberia, and many of the would-be colonists had their families with\r\nthem. But those who had none ventured to remark to Muravióff: ‘What\r\nis agriculture without a wife? We ought to be married.’ Whereupon\r\nMuravióff ordered to release all the hard-labour convict women of the\r\nplace--about a hundred--and offered them the choice of the man each of\r\nthem would like to marry and to follow. However, there was little time\r\nto lose; the high water in the river was rapidly going down, the rafts\r\nhad to start, and Muravióff, asking the people to stand in pairs on the\r\nbeach, blessed them, saying: ‘I marry you, children. Be kind to each\r\nother; you men, don’t ill-treat your wives--and be happy!’\r\n\r\nI saw these settlers some six years after that scene. Their villages\r\nwere poor, the land they had been settled on having had to be cleared\r\nfrom under virgin forests; but, all taken, their settlements were\r\nnot a failure, and ‘the Muravióff marriages’ were not less happy\r\nthan marriages are on the average. That excellent, intelligent man,\r\nInnocentus, bishop of the Amúr, recognized, later on, these marriages,\r\nas well as the children which were born, as quite legal, and had them\r\ninscribed on the Church registers.\r\n\r\nMuravióff was less successful, though, with another batch of men that\r\nhe added to the population of East Siberia. In his penury of men he had\r\naccepted a couple of thousand soldiers from the punishment battalions.\r\nThey were incorporated as ‘adopted sons’ in the families of the\r\nCossacks, or were settled in joint households in the villages. But ten\r\nor twenty years of barrack life under the horrid discipline of Nicholas\r\nI.’s time surely was not a preparation for an agricultural life. The\r\n‘sons’ deserted their adopted fathers and constituted the floating\r\npopulation of the towns, living from hand to mouth on occasional jobs,\r\nspending chiefly in drink what they earned, and then again living as\r\nbirds in the sky in the expectation of another job turning up.\r\n\r\nThe motley crowd of Transbaikálian Cossacks, of ex-convicts, and\r\n‘sons,’ who were settled in a hurry and often in a haphazard way along\r\nthe banks of the Amúr, certainly did not attain prosperity, especially\r\nin the lower parts of the river and on the Usurí, where every square\r\nyard had often to be won upon a virgin sub-tropical forest, and deluges\r\nof rain brought by the monsoons in July, inundations on a gigantic\r\nscale, millions of migrating birds, and the like continually destroyed\r\nthe crops, finally bringing whole populations to sheer despair and\r\napathy.\r\n\r\nConsiderable supplies of salt, flour, cured meat, and so on had thus\r\nto be shipped every year to support both the regular troops and the\r\nsettlements on the lower Amúr, and for that purpose some hundred and\r\nfifty barges used to be built and loaded at Chitá, and floated with\r\nthe early spring floods down the Ingodá, the Shílka, and the Amúr. The\r\nwhole flotilla was divided into detachments of from twenty to thirty\r\nbarges, which were placed under the orders of a number of Cossack\r\nand civil-service officers. Most of them did not know much about\r\nnavigation, but they could be trusted, at least, not to steal the\r\nprovisions and then report them as lost. I was nominated assistant to\r\nthe chief of all that flotilla--let me name him, Major Maróvsky.\r\n\r\nMy first experiences in my new capacity of navigator were all but\r\nsuccessful. It so happened that I had to proceed with a few barges\r\nas rapidly as possible to a certain point on the Amúr, and there to\r\nhand over my vessels. For that purpose I had to hire men exactly from\r\namong those ‘sons’ whom I have already mentioned. None of them had\r\never had any experience in river navigation, nor had I. On the morning\r\nof our start my crew had to be collected from the public-houses of\r\nthe place, most of them being so drunk at that early hour that they\r\nhad to be bathed in the river to bring them back to their senses.\r\nWhen we were afloat, I had to teach them everything that had to be\r\ndone. Still, things went pretty well during the day; the barges,\r\ncarried along by a swift current, floated down the river, and my crew,\r\ninexperienced though they were, had no interest in throwing their\r\nvessels upon the shore--that would have required special exertion. But\r\nwhen dusk came, and our huge heavily laden fifty-ton barges had to\r\nbe brought to the shore and fastened to it for the night, one of the\r\nbarges, which was far ahead of the one upon which I was, was stopped\r\nonly when it was fast upon a rock, at the foot of a tremendously high\r\ninaccessible cliff. There it stood immovable, while the level of the\r\nriver, temporarily swollen by rains, was rapidly going down. My ten\r\nmen evidently could not move it. So I rowed down to the next village\r\nto ask assistance from the Cossacks, and at the same time despatched a\r\nmessenger to a friend--a Cossack officer who stayed some twenty miles\r\naway and who had experience in such things.\r\n\r\nThe morning came; a hundred Cossacks--men and women--had come to my\r\naid, but there was no means whatever to connect the barge with the\r\nshore, in order to unload it--so deep was the water under the cliff.\r\nAnd, as soon as we attempted to push it off the rock, its bottom\r\nwas broken in and water freely entered it, sweeping away the flour\r\nand the salt of the cargo. To my great horror, I perceived lots of\r\nsmall fish entering through the hole and freely swimming about in the\r\nbarge--and I stood there helpless, not knowing what to do next. There\r\nis a very simple and effective remedy for such emergencies. A sack of\r\nflour is thrust into the hole, and it soon takes its shape, while the\r\nouter crust of paste which is formed in the sack prevents water from\r\npenetrating through the flour; but none of us knew anything about it.\r\nHappily enough, a few minutes later a barge was signalled coming down\r\nthe river towards us. The appearance of the swan who carried Lohengrin\r\nwas not greeted with more enthusiasm by the despairing Elsa than that\r\nclumsy vessel was greeted by me. The haze which covered the beautiful\r\nShílka at that early hour in the morning added even more to the poetry\r\nof the vision. It was my friend the Cossack officer, who had realized\r\nby my description that no human force could drag my barge off the\r\nrock--that it was lost--and taking an empty barge which by chance was\r\nat hand, came with it to place upon it the cargo of my doomed craft.\r\nNow the hole was filled up, the water was pumped out, and the cargo was\r\ntransferred to the new barge, which was fastened alongside mine; and\r\nnext morning I could continue my journey. This little experience was\r\nof great profit to me, and I soon reached my destination on the Amúr\r\nwithout further adventures worth mentioning. Every night we found out\r\nsome stretch of steep but relatively low shore where to stop with the\r\nbarges for the night, and our fires were soon lighted on the bank of\r\nthe swift and clear river, amidst most beautiful mountain scenery. In\r\ndaytime, one could hardly imagine a more pleasant journey than on board\r\na barge which leisurely floats down, without any of the noises of a\r\nsteamer--one or two strokes being occasionally given with its immense\r\nstern rudder to keep it in the main current. For the lover of nature,\r\nthe lower part of the Shílka and the upper part of the Amúr, where one\r\nsees a most beautiful, wide, and swift river flowing amidst mountains\r\nrising in steep wooded cliffs a couple of thousand feet above the\r\nwater, offers one of the most delightful scenes in the world. But on\r\nthat very account communication along the shore, on horseback, along a\r\nnarrow trail, is extremely difficult. I learned this that same autumn\r\nat my own expense. In East Siberia the seven last stations along the\r\nShílka (about 120 miles) were known as the Seven Mortal Sins. This\r\nstretch of the Trans-Siberian railway--if it is ever built--will cost\r\nunimaginable sums of money: much more than the stretch of the Canadian\r\nPacific line in the Rocky Mountains, in the Canyon of the Fraser River,\r\nhas cost.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter I had delivered my barges, I made about a thousand miles down the\r\nAmúr in one of the post boats which are used on the river. The boat is\r\ncovered with a light shed in its back part, and has on its stem a box\r\nfilled with earth upon which a fire is kept to cook the food. My crew\r\nconsisted of three men. We had to make haste, and therefore used to row\r\nin turns all day long, while at night the boat was left to float with\r\nthe current, and I kept the watch for three or four hours to maintain\r\nthe boat in the midst of the river and to prevent it from being dragged\r\ninto some side branch. These watches--the full moon shining above,\r\nand the dark hills reflected in the river--were beautiful beyond\r\ndescription. My rowers were taken from the same ‘sons;’ they were\r\nthree tramps who had the reputation of being incorrigible thieves and\r\nrobbers--and I carried with me a heavy sack full of bank-notes, silver,\r\nand copper. In Western Europe such a journey on a lonely river would\r\nhave been considered risky--not so in East Siberia; I made it without\r\neven having so much as an old pistol, and I found my three tramps\r\nexcellent company. Only as we approached Blagovéschensk they became\r\nrestless. ‘Khánshina’ (the Chinese brandy) ‘is cheap there,’ they\r\nreasoned with deep sighs. ‘We are sure to get into trouble! It’s cheap,\r\nand it knocks you over in no time from want of being used to it!’ ...\r\nI offered to leave the money which was due to them with a friend, who\r\nwould see them off with the first steamer. ‘That would not help us,’\r\nthey replied mournfully; ‘somebody will offer a glass ... it’s cheap,\r\n... and a glass knocks you over!’ they persisted in saying. They were\r\nreally perplexed, and when, a few months later, I returned through\r\nthe town I learned that one of ‘my sons’--as people called them in\r\ntown--had really got into trouble. When he had sold the last pair of\r\nboots to get the poisonous drink, he had made some theft and was locked\r\nup. My friend finally obtained his release and shipped him back.\r\n\r\nOnly those who have seen the Amúr, or know the Mississippi or the\r\nYang-tse-kiang, can imagine what an immense river the Amúr becomes\r\nafter it has joined the Sungarí and can realize what tremendous waves\r\nroll up its bed if the weather is stormy. When the rainy season, due to\r\nthe monsoons, comes in July, the Sungarí, the Usurí, and the Amúr are\r\nswollen by unimaginable quantities of water; thousands of low islands,\r\nusually covered with willow thickets, are inundated or torn away, and\r\nthe width of the river attains in places two, three, and even five\r\nmiles; water rushes into hundreds of branches and lakes which spread\r\nin the lowlands along the main channel; and when a fresh wind blows\r\nfrom an eastern quarter, against the current, tremendous waves, higher\r\nthan those which one sees in the estuary of the St. Lawrence, roll up\r\nthe main channel as well as up its branches. Still worse is it when a\r\ntyphoon blows from the Chinese Sea and spreads over the Amúr region.\r\n\r\nWe experienced such a typhoon. I was then on board a large decked boat,\r\nwith Major Maróvsky, whom I had joined at Blagovéschensk. He had well\r\nprovided his boat with sails, which permitted us to sail close to the\r\nwind, and when the storm began we managed, nevertheless, to bring our\r\nboat on the sheltered side of the river and to find refuge in some\r\nsmall tributary. There we stayed for two days while the storm raged\r\nwith such fury that when I ventured for a few hundred yards into\r\nthe surrounding forest, I had to retreat on account of the number of\r\nimmense trees which the wind was blowing down round me. We began to\r\nfeel very uneasy for our barges. It was evident that if they had been\r\nafloat this morning, they never would have been able to reach the\r\nsheltered side of the river, but must have been driven by the storm to\r\nthe bank exposed to the full rage of the wind, and there they must have\r\nbeen destroyed. A disaster was almost certain.\r\n\r\nWe sailed out as soon as the main fury of the storm had abated. We knew\r\nthat we must soon overtake two detachments of barges; but we sailed one\r\nday, two days, and there was no trace of them. My friend Maróvsky lost\r\nboth sleep and appetite, and looked as if he had just had a serious\r\nillness. He sat whole days on the deck, motionless, murmuring: ‘All is\r\nlost, all is lost!’ The villages are few and rare in this part of the\r\nAmúr, and nobody could give us any information. A new storm came on,\r\nand when we reached at last a village, we learned that no barges had\r\npassed by it, and that quantities of wreck had been seen floating down\r\nthe river during the previous day. It was evident that at least forty\r\nbarges, which carried a cargo of about 2,000 tons, must have perished.\r\nIt meant a certain famine next spring on the lower Amúr if no supplies\r\nwere brought in time. We were late in the season, navigation would soon\r\nbe closed, and there was no telegraph yet along the river.\r\n\r\nWe held a council and decided that Maróvsky should sail as quickly\r\nas possible to the mouth of the Amúr. Some purchases of grain might\r\nperhaps be made in Japan before the close of the navigation. Meanwhile\r\nI was to go with all possible speed up the river, to determine the\r\nlosses, and do my best to cover the two thousand miles of the Amúr and\r\nthe Shílka--in boats, on horseback, or on board steamer if I met one.\r\nThe sooner I could warn the Chitá authorities, and despatch any amount\r\nof provisions available, the better it would be. Perhaps part of them\r\nwould reach this same autumn the upper Amúr, whence it would be easier\r\nto ship them in the early spring to the lowlands. Even if a few weeks\r\nor only days could be won, it might make an immense difference in case\r\nof a famine.\r\n\r\nI began my two thousand miles’ journey in a rowing boat, changing\r\nrowers each twenty miles or so, at each village. It was very slow\r\nprogress, but there might be no steamer coming up the river for a\r\nfortnight, and in the meantime I could reach the spots where the barges\r\nwere wrecked, and see if any of the provisions had been saved. Then,\r\nat the mouth of the Usurí (Khabaróvsk) I might find a steamer. The\r\nboats which I took in the villages were miserable, and the weather\r\nvery stormy. We kept evidently along the shore, but we had to cross\r\nsome branches of the Amúr of great width, and the waves, driven by\r\nthe high wind, threatened continually to swamp our little craft. One\r\nday we had to cross a branch of the Amúr nearly half a mile wide.\r\nChopped waves rose like mountains as they rolled up that branch. My\r\nrowers, two peasants, were seized with terror; their faces were white\r\nas paper; their blue lips trembled, they murmured prayers. Only a boy\r\nof fifteen, who held the rudder, calmly kept a watchful eye upon the\r\nwaves. He glided between them as they seemed to sink around us for a\r\nmoment; but when he saw them rising to a menacing height in front of\r\nus he gave a slight turn to the boat and steadied it across the waves.\r\nThe boat shipped water from each wave, and I threw it out with an old\r\nladle, noting at times that it accumulated more rapidly than I could\r\nget rid of it. There was a moment when the boat shipped two such big\r\nwaves that, on a sign given to me by one of the trembling rowers, I\r\nunfastened the heavy sackful of copper and silver that I carried across\r\nmy shoulder.... For several days in succession we had such crossings. I\r\nnever forced the men to cross, but they themselves, knowing why I had\r\nto hurry, would decide at a given moment that an attempt must be made.\r\n‘There are not seven deaths in one’s life, and one cannot be avoided,’\r\nthey would say, and, signing themselves with the cross, would seize the\r\noars and pull over.\r\n\r\nI soon reached the places where the main destruction of our barges took\r\nplace. Forty-four barges had been destroyed by the storm. Unloading\r\nhad been impossible, and very little of the cargo had been saved. Two\r\nthousand tons of flour had perished in the waves. With this message I\r\ncontinued my journey.\r\n\r\nA few days later a steamer slowly creeping up the river overtook me,\r\nand when I boarded her the passengers told me that the captain had\r\ndrunk so much that he was seized with delirium and jumped overboard.\r\nHe was saved, though, and was now lying ill in his cabin. They asked\r\nme to take the command of the steamer, and I had to accept it; but\r\nsoon I realized, to my great astonishment, that everything went on by\r\nitself in such an excellent routine way that, though I paraded all day\r\non the bridge, I had almost nothing to do. Apart from a few minutes\r\nof real responsibility when the steamer had to be brought to the\r\nlanding-places, where we took wood for fuel, and saying a few words now\r\nand then for encouraging the stokers to start as soon as dawn permitted\r\nus faintly to distinguish the outlines of the shores, everything went\r\non by itself, requiring but little interference of mine. A pilot who\r\nwould have been able to interpret the map would have managed as well.\r\n\r\nTravelling by steamer and a great deal on horseback I reached at last\r\nTransbaikália. The idea of a famine that might break out next spring\r\non the lower Amúr oppressed me all the time. I found that the small\r\nsteamer on board of which I was did not progress up the swift Shílka\r\nrapidly enough, and in order to gain some twenty hours, or even less, I\r\nabandoned it and rode with a Cossack a couple of hundred miles up the\r\nArgúñ, along one of the wildest mountain tracks in Siberia, stopping to\r\nlight our camp fire only after midnight would have overtaken us in the\r\nwoods. Even the ten or twenty hours that I might gain by this exertion\r\nhad not to be despised, because every day brought us nearer to the\r\nclose of navigation: at nights, ice was already forming on the river.\r\nAt last I met the Governor of Transbaikdália, and my friend, Colonel\r\nPedashénko, on the Shílka, at the convict settlement of Kará, and the\r\nlatter took in hand the care of shipping immediately all available\r\nprovisions. As to me, I left immediately to report all about the matter\r\nat Irkútsk.\r\n\r\nPeople at Irkútsk wondered that I had managed to make this long journey\r\nso rapidly, but I was quite worn out. However, youth quickly recovers\r\nits strength, and I recovered mine by sleeping for some time such a\r\nnumber of hours every day that I should be ashamed to say how many.\r\n\r\n‘Have you taken some rest?’ the Governor-General asked me a week or so\r\nafter my arrival. ‘Could you start to-morrow for St. Petersburg, as a\r\ncourier, to report there yourself upon the loss of the barges?’\r\n\r\nIt meant to cover in twenty days--not one day more--another distance\r\nof 3,200 miles between Irkútsk and Níjni-Nóvgorod, where I could take\r\nthe railway to St. Petersburg; to gallop day and night in post-carts\r\nwhich had to be changed at every station, because no carriage would\r\nstand such a journey full speed over the ruts of the roads frozen at\r\nthe end of the autumn. But to see my brother Alexander was too great\r\nan attraction for me not to accept the offer, and I started the next\r\nnight. When I reached the lowlands of West Siberia and the Urals the\r\njourney really became a torture. There were days when the wheels of the\r\ncarts would be broken over the frozen ruts at every successive station.\r\nThe rivers were freezing, and I had to cross the Ob in a boat amidst\r\nthe floating ice, which menaced at every moment to crush our small\r\ncraft. When I reached the Tom river, on which the ice had only stopped\r\nfloating during the preceding night, the peasants refused for some time\r\nto take me over, asking me to give them ‘a receipt.’\r\n\r\n‘What sort of receipt do you want?’\r\n\r\n‘Well, you write on a paper: “I, undersigned, hereby testify that I was\r\ndrowned by the will of God and by no fault of the peasants,” and you\r\ngive us that paper.’\r\n\r\n‘With pleasure, on the other shore.’\r\n\r\nAt last they took me over. A boy--a brave, bright boy whom I had\r\nselected in the crowd--opened the procession, testing the strength of\r\nthe ice with a pole; I followed him, carrying my despatch-box on my\r\nshoulders, and we two were attached to long reins which five peasants\r\nheld, following us at a distance--one of them carrying a bundle of\r\nstraw, to be thrown on the ice if it should not seem strong enough.\r\n\r\nAt last I reached Moscow, where my brother met me at the station, and\r\nwe proceeded at once to St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nYouth is a grand thing. After such a journey, which lasted twenty-four\r\ndays and nights, when I came, early in the morning, to St. Petersburg,\r\nI went the same day to deliver my despatches, and did not fail also\r\nto call upon an aunt--or, rather, upon a cousin--who resided at St.\r\nPetersburg. She was radiant. ‘We have a dancing party to-night. Will\r\nyou come?’ she said. Of course I would! And not only come, but dance\r\nuntil an early hour of the morning.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen I came to St. Petersburg and saw the authorities, I understood\r\nwhy I had been sent to make the report. Nobody would believe the\r\npossibility of such a destruction of the barges. ‘Have you been on the\r\nspot? Did you see the destruction with your own eyes? Are you perfectly\r\nsure that “they” have not simply stolen the provisions and shown you\r\nthe wreck of some barges?’ Such were the questions I had to answer.\r\n\r\nThe high functionaries who stood at the head of Siberian affairs at\r\nSt. Petersburg were simply charming in their innocent ignorance of\r\nSiberia. ‘_Mais, mon cher_,’ one of them said to me--he always spoke\r\nFrench---‘how _is_ it possible that forty barges should be destroyed\r\non the Nevá without anyone rushing to help save them?’ ‘The Nevá,’ I\r\nexclaimed; ‘put three, four Nevás side by side, and you will have the\r\nlower Amúr!’\r\n\r\n‘Is it really as big as that?’ And two minutes later he was chatting,\r\nin excellent French, about all sorts of things. ‘When did you last\r\nsee Schwartz, the painter? Is not his “John the Terrible” a wonderful\r\npicture? Do you know for what reason Kúkel was going to be arrested? Do\r\nyou know that Chernyshévsky is arrested? He is now in the fortress.’\r\n\r\n‘What for? What has he done?’ I asked.\r\n\r\n‘Nothing particular; nothing! But, _mon cher_, you know, State\r\nconsiderations! Such a clever man, awfully clever! And such an\r\ninfluence he has upon the youth. You understand that a Government\r\ncannot tolerate that: that’s impossible! _intolérable, mon cher, dans\r\nun État bien ordonné!_’\r\n\r\nCount Ignátieff made no such questions; he knew the Amúr very well,\r\nand he knew St. Petersburg too. Amidst all sorts of jokes, and witty\r\nremarks about Siberia which he made with an astounding vivacity, he\r\ndropped to me: ‘It is a very lucky thing that you were there on the\r\nspot, and saw the wrecks. And “they” were clever to send you with the\r\nreport! Well done! At first, nobody wanted to believe about the barges.\r\nSome new swindling, it was thought. But now people say that you were\r\nwell known as a page, and you have only been a few months in Siberia;\r\nso you would not shelter the people there if it were swindling. They\r\ntrust in you.’\r\n\r\nThe Minister of War, Dmítri Milútin, was the only man in the high\r\nadministration of St. Petersburg who took the matter seriously. He\r\nasked me many questions: all to the point. He mastered the subject at\r\nonce, and all our conversation was in short sentences, without hurry,\r\nbut without any waste of words. ‘The coast settlements to be supplied\r\nfrom the sea, you mean? The remainder only from Chitá? Quite right. But\r\nif a storm happens next year, will there be the same destruction once\r\nmore?’ ‘No, if there are two small tugs to convoy the barges.’ ‘Will it\r\ndo?’ ‘Yes, with one tug the loss would not have been half so heavy.’\r\n‘Very probably. Write to me, please; state all you have said, quite\r\nplainly; no formalities.’\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nI did not stay long at St. Petersburg, and returned to Irkútsk the same\r\nwinter. My brother was going to join me there in a few months; he was\r\naccepted as an officer of the Irkútsk Cossacks.\r\n\r\nTravelling across Siberia in the winter is supposed to be a terrible\r\nexperience; but, all things considered, it is on the whole more\r\ncomfortable than at any other season of the year. The snow-covered\r\nroads are excellent, and, although the cold is fearful, one can stand\r\nit well enough. Lying full length in the sledge--as everyone does in\r\nSiberia--wrapped in fur blankets, fur inside and fur outside, one\r\ndoes not suffer much from the cold, even when the temperature is\r\nforty or sixty Fahrenheit degrees below zero. Travelling in courier\r\nfashion--that is, rapidly changing horses at each station and stopping\r\nonly once a day for one hour to take a meal--I reached Irkútsk nineteen\r\ndays after I had left St. Petersburg. Two hundred miles a day is the\r\nnormal speed in such cases, and I remember having covered the last 660\r\nmiles before Irkútsk in seventy hours. The frost was not severe then,\r\nthe roads were in an excellent condition, the drivers were kept in good\r\nspirits by a free allowance of silver coins, and the team of three\r\nsmall and light horses seemed to enjoy running swiftly across hill\r\nand vale, and across rivers frozen as hard as steel, amidst forests\r\nglistening in their silver attire in the rays of the sun.\r\n\r\nI was now nominated attaché to the Governor-General of East Siberia for\r\nCossack affairs, and had to reside at Irkútsk; but there was nothing\r\nparticular to do. To let everything go on, according to the established\r\nroutine, with no more reference to changes, such was the watchword that\r\ncame now from St. Petersburg. I therefore gladly accepted the proposal\r\nto undertake geographical exploration in Manchuria.\r\n\r\nIf one casts a glance on a map of Asia one sees that the Russian\r\nfrontier, which runs in Siberia, broadly speaking, along the fiftieth\r\ndegree of latitude, suddenly bends in Transbaikália to the north. It\r\nfollows for three hundred miles the Argúñ river; then, on reaching\r\nthe Amúr, it turns south-eastwards--the town of Blagovéschensk, which\r\nwas the capital of the Amúr land, being situated again in about the\r\nsame latitude of fifty degrees. Between the south-eastern corner of\r\nTransbaikália (New Tsurukháitu) and Blagovéschensk on the Amúr, the\r\ndistance west to east is only five hundred miles; but along the Argúñ\r\nand the Amúr it is over a thousand miles, and moreover communication\r\nalong the Argúñ, which is not navigable, is extremely difficult. In its\r\nlower parts there is nothing but a most wild mountain track.\r\n\r\nTransbaikália is very rich in cattle, and the Cossacks who occupy\r\nits south-eastern corner, and are wealthy cattle-breeders, wanted to\r\nestablish a direct communication with the middle Amúr, which would be\r\na good market for their cattle. They used to trade with the Mongols,\r\nand they had heard from them that it would not be difficult to reach\r\nthe Amúr, travelling eastwards across the Great Khingán. Going straight\r\ntowards the east, they were told, one would fall in with an old Chinese\r\nroute which crosses the Khingán and leads to the Manchurian town of\r\nMerghén (on the Nónni river, a tributary to the Sungarí), whence an\r\nexcellent road leads to the middle Amúr.\r\n\r\nI was offered the leadership of a trading caravan which the Cossacks\r\nintended to organize in order to find that route, and I accepted it\r\nwith enthusiasm. No European had ever visited that region, and a\r\nRussian topographer who went that way a few years before was killed.\r\nOnly two Jesuits, in the time of the emperor Kan-si, had penetrated\r\nfrom the south as far as Merghén, and had determined its latitude. All\r\nthe immense region to the north of it, five hundred miles wide and\r\nfive hundred miles deep, was totally, absolutely unknown. I consulted\r\nall the available sources about this region. Nobody, not even the\r\nChinese geographers, knew anything about it. Besides, the very fact\r\nof connecting the middle Amúr with Transbaikália had its importance;\r\nTsurukháitu is now going to be the head of the Trans-Manchuria railway.\r\nWe were thus the pioneers of that great enterprise.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, one difficulty. The treaty with China granted\r\nto the Russians free trade with the ‘Empire of China and Mongolia.’\r\nManchuria was not mentioned in it, and could as well be excluded as\r\nincluded in the treaty. The Chinese frontier authorities interpreted\r\nit one way, and the Russians the other way. Moreover, only trade being\r\nmentioned, an officer would not be allowed to enter Manchuria. I had\r\nthus to go as a trader, and accordingly I bought at Irkútsk various\r\ngoods, and went disguised as a merchant. The Governor-General delivered\r\nme a passport, ‘To the Irkútsk second guild merchant Petr Alexéiev\r\nand his companions,’ and he warned me that if the Chinese authorities\r\narrested me and took me to Pekin, and thence across the Góbi to\r\nthe Russian frontier--in a cage on a camel’s back was their way of\r\nconveying prisoners across Mongolia--I must not betray him by naming\r\nmyself. I accepted, of course, all the conditions, the temptation to\r\nvisit a country which no European had ever seen being too great for an\r\nexplorer.\r\n\r\nIt would not have been easy to conceal my identity while I was in\r\nTransbaikália. The Cossacks are an extremely inquisitive sort of\r\npeople--real Mongols--and as soon as a stranger comes to one of their\r\nvillages, while treating him with the greatest hospitality, the master\r\nof the house submits the new-comer to a formal interrogatory.\r\n\r\n‘A tedious journey, I suppose,’ he begins; ‘a long way from Chitá, is\r\nit not? And then, perhaps, longer still for one who comes from some\r\nplace beyond Chitá? Maybe from Irkútsk? Trading there, I believe? Many\r\ntradesmen come this way. You are going also to Nerchínsk, I should\r\nsay?--Yes, people are often married at your age; and you, too, must\r\nhave left a family, I suppose? Many children? Not all boys, I should\r\nsay?’ And so on for quite half an hour.\r\n\r\nThe local commander of the Cossacks, Captain Buxhövden, knew his\r\npeople, and consequently we had taken our precautions. At Chitá and at\r\nIrkútsk we often had had amateur theatricals, playing in preference\r\ndramas of Ostróvsky, in which the scene of action is nearly always\r\namongst the merchant classes. I played several times in different\r\ndramas, and found such great pleasure in acting that I even wrote on\r\none occasion to my brother an enthusiastic letter confessing to him my\r\npassionate desire to abandon my military career and to go on the stage.\r\nI played mostly young merchants, and had so well got hold of their\r\nways of talking and gesticulating, and tea drinking from the saucer--I\r\nknew these ways since my Nikólskoye experiences--that now I had a good\r\nopportunity to act it all out in reality for useful purposes.\r\n\r\n‘Take your seat, Petr Alexéievich,’ Captain Buxhövden would say to me,\r\nwhen the boiling tea-urn, throwing out clouds of steam, was placed on\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\n‘Thank you; we may stay here’, I would reply, sitting on the edge\r\nof a chair at a distance, and beginning to drink my tea in true\r\nMoscow-merchant fashion. Buxhövden meanwhile nearly exploded with\r\nlaughter as I blew upon my saucer with staring eyes, and bit off in a\r\nspecial way microscopic particles from a small lump of sugar which was\r\nto serve for half a dozen cups.\r\n\r\nWe knew that the Cossacks would soon make out the truth about me,\r\nbut the important thing was to win a few days only, and to cross the\r\nfrontier while my identity was not yet discovered. I must have played\r\nmy part pretty well, as the Cossacks treated me as a small merchant.\r\nIn one village an old woman beckoned me in the passage and asked me:\r\n‘Are there more people coming behind you on the road, my dear?’ ‘None,\r\ngrandmother, that we heard of.’ ‘They said a prince, Rapótsky, was\r\ngoing to come. Is he coming?’\r\n\r\n‘Oh, I see. You are right, grandmother. His Highness intended to go,\r\ntoo, from Irkútsk. But how can he? Such a journey! Not suitable for\r\nthem. So they remained where they were.’\r\n\r\n‘Of course, how can he?’\r\n\r\nIn short, we crossed the frontier unmolested. We were eleven Cossacks,\r\none Tungus, and myself, all on horseback. We had with us about forty\r\nhorses for sale and two carts, one of which, two-wheeled, belonged to\r\nme, and contained the cloth, the velveteen, the gold braid, and so on,\r\nwhich I had taken in my capacity of merchant. I attended to it and to\r\nmy horses entirely myself, while we chose one of the Cossacks to be the\r\n‘elder’ of our caravan. He had to manage all the diplomatic talk with\r\nthe Chinese authorities. All Cossacks spoke Mongolian, and the Tungus\r\nunderstood Manchurian. The Cossacks of the caravan knew, of course, who\r\nI was--one of them knew me at Irkútsk--but they never betrayed that\r\nknowledge, understanding that the success of the expedition depended\r\nupon it. I wore a long blue cotton dress, like the others, and the\r\nChinese paid no attention to me, so that I could make, unnoticed by\r\nthem, the compass survey of the route. The first day only, when all\r\nsorts of Chinese soldiers hung about us in the hope of getting a glass\r\nof whisky, I had often to cast only a furtive glance at my compass and\r\nto inscribe the bearings and the distances in my pocket, without taking\r\nmy paper out. We had with us no arms whatever. Only our Tungus, who was\r\ngoing to marry, had taken his matchlock gun and used it to hunt for\r\nfallow deer, bringing us meat for supper, and making a provision of\r\nfurs with which to pay for his future wife.\r\n\r\nWhen there was no more whisky to be obtained from us the Chinese\r\nsoldiers left us alone. So we went straight eastwards, finding our way\r\nas best we could across hill and dale, and after a four or five days’\r\nmarch we really fell in with the Chinese track which had to take us\r\nacross the Khingán to Merghén.\r\n\r\nTo our astonishment we discovered that the crossing of the great ridge,\r\nwhich looked so black and terrible on the maps, was most easy. We\r\novertook on the road an old Chinese functionary, miserably wretched,\r\nwho travelled in the same direction in a two-wheeled cart. For the last\r\ntwo days the road was going up hill, and the country bore testimony\r\nto its high altitude. The ground became marshy, and the road was\r\nmuddy; the grass was very poor, and the trees grew thin, undeveloped,\r\noften crippled and covered with lichens. Mountains devoid of forests\r\nrose right and left, and we thought already of the difficulties we\r\nshould experience in crossing the ridge, when we saw the old Chinese\r\nfunctionary alighting from his cart before an _obó_--that is, before a\r\nheap made of stones and branches of trees to which bundles of horsehair\r\nand small rags had been attached. He drew several hairs out of the mane\r\nof his horse, and attached them to the branches.\r\n\r\n‘What is that?’ we asked.\r\n\r\n‘The _obó_--the waters before us flow now to the Amúr.’\r\n\r\n‘Is that all of the Khingán?’\r\n\r\n‘Yes! No mountains more to cross as far as the Amúr: only hills!’\r\n\r\nQuite a commotion spread in our caravan. ‘The rivers flow to the Amúr,\r\nthe Amúr!’ shouted the Cossacks to each other. All their lives they had\r\nheard the old Cossacks talking about the great river where the vine\r\ngrows wild, where the prairies extend for hundreds of miles and could\r\ngive wealth to millions of men; then, after the Amúr was annexed to\r\nRussia, they heard of the long journey to it, the difficulties of the\r\nfirst settlers, and the prosperity of their relatives settled on the\r\nupper Amúr; and now we had found the short way to it! We had before us\r\na steep slope upon which the road went downwards in zig-zags leading\r\nto a small river, which pierced its way through a chopped sea of\r\nmountains, and led to the Amúr. No more obstacles lay between us and\r\nthe great river. A traveller will imagine my delight at this unexpected\r\ngeographical discovery. As to the Cossacks, they hastened to dismount\r\nand to attach in their turn bundles of hair taken from their horses to\r\nthe branches thrown on the _obó_. The Siberians altogether have a sort\r\nof awe for the gods of the heathen. They don’t think much of them, but\r\nthese gods, they say, are wicked creatures, bent on mischief, and it is\r\nnever good to be on bad terms with them. It is far better to bribe them\r\nwith small tokens of respect.\r\n\r\n‘Look, here is a strange tree: it must be an oak,’ they exclaimed,\r\nas we went down the steep slope. The oak does not grow, indeed, in\r\nSiberia. None is found until the eastern slope of the high plateau\r\nhas been reached. ‘Look, nut trees!’ they exclaimed next. ‘And what\r\ntree is that?’ they said, seeing a lime tree, or some other tree\r\nwhich does not grow in Russia either, but which I knew as part of the\r\nManchurian flora. The northerners, who for centuries had dreamed of\r\nwarmer lands, and now saw them, were in delight. Lying on the ground\r\ncovered with rich grass, they caressed it with their eyes--they would\r\nhave kissed it. Now they burned with the desire to reach the Amúr as\r\nsoon as possible. When, a fortnight later, we stopped at our last camp\r\nfire within twenty miles from the river, they grew impatient like\r\nchildren. They began to saddle their horses shortly after midnight,\r\nand hurried me to start long before daybreak; and when at last we\r\ncaught from an eminence a sight of the mighty stream, the eyes of these\r\nunimpressionable Siberians, generally devoid of poetical feeling,\r\ngleamed with poetical ardour as they looked upon the blue waters of the\r\nmajestic Amúr. It was evident that, sooner or later--with or without\r\nthe support, or even against the wish, of the Russian Government--both\r\nbanks of this river, a desert now but rich in possibilities, as well\r\nas the immense unpopulated stretches of North Manchuria, would be\r\ninvaded by Russian settlers, just as the shores of the Mississippi were\r\ncolonized by the Canadian _voyageurs_.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the old half-blind Chinese functionary with whom we had\r\ncrossed the Khingán, having donned his blue coat and official hat with\r\na glass button on its top, declared to us next morning that he would\r\nnot let us go further. Our ‘elder’ had received him and his clerk in\r\nour tent, and the old man, repeating what the clerk whispered to him,\r\nraised all sorts of objections to our further progress. He wanted us to\r\ncamp on the spot while he would send our pass to Pekin to get orders,\r\nwhich we absolutely refused to do. Then he sought to quarrel with our\r\npassport.\r\n\r\n‘What sort of a passport is that?’ he said, looking with disdain into\r\nour pass, which was written in a few lines on a plain sheet of foolscap\r\npaper, in Russian and Mongolian, and had a simple sealing-wax seal.\r\n‘You may have written it yourselves and sealed it with a copper,’ he\r\nremarked, ‘Look at my pass: this is worth something,’ and he unrolled\r\nbefore us a sheet of paper, two feet long, covered with Chinese\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\nI sat quietly aside during this conference, packing something in my\r\nbox, when a sheet of the ‘Moscow Gazette’ fell under my hand. The\r\nGazette, being the property of the Moscow University, had an eagle\r\nprinted on its title-heading. ‘Show him this,’ I said to our elder.\r\nHe unfolded the large sheet of print and pointed out the eagle. ‘That\r\npass was to show to you,’ our elder said, ‘but this is what we have for\r\nourselves.’\r\n\r\n‘Why, is it all written about you?’ the old man asked with terror.\r\n\r\n‘All about us,’ our elder replied, without even a twinkle in his eyes.\r\n\r\nThe old man--a true functionary--looked quite dumbfounded at seeing\r\nsuch a profusion of writing. He examined every one of us, nodding with\r\nhis head. But the clerk was still whispering something to his chief,\r\nwho finally declared that he would not let us continue the journey.\r\n\r\n‘Enough of talking,’ I said to the elder; ‘give the order to saddle\r\nthe horses.’ The Cossacks were of the same opinion, and in no time our\r\ncaravan started, bidding good-bye to the old functionary and promising\r\nhim to report that short of resorting to violence--which he was not\r\nable to do--he had done all in his power to prevent us from entering\r\nManchuria, and that it was our fault if we went nevertheless.\r\n\r\nA few days later we were at Merghén, where we traded a little, and soon\r\nreached the Chinese town of Aigún, on the right bank of the Amúr, and\r\nthe Russian town of Blagovéschensk, on the left bank. We had discovered\r\nthe direct route and many interesting things besides: the border-ridge\r\ncharacter of the Great Khinghán, the ease with which it can be crossed,\r\nthe tertiary volcanoes of the Uyún Kholdontsí region, which had so long\r\nbeen a puzzle in geographical literature, and so on. I cannot say that\r\nI was a sharp tradesman, for at Merghén I persisted (in broken Chinese)\r\nin asking thirty-five roubles for a watch when the Chinese buyer had\r\nalready offered me forty-five; but the Cossacks traded all right. They\r\nsold very well all their horses, and when my horses, my goods, and the\r\nrest were sold by the Cossacks it appeared that the expedition had cost\r\nthe government the modest sum of twenty-two roubles--a little over two\r\npounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nAll this summer I travelled on the Amúr. I went as far as its mouth, or\r\nrather its estuary--Nikoláevsk--to join the Governor-General, whom I\r\naccompanied in a steamer up the Usurí; and after that, in the autumn, I\r\nmade a still more interesting journey up the Sungarí, to the very heart\r\nof Manchuria, as far as Ghirín (or Kirín, according to the southern\r\npronunciation).\r\n\r\nMany rivers in Asia are formed by the junction of two equally important\r\nstreams, so that it is difficult for the geographer to say which of\r\nthe two is the main one and which is a tributary. The Ingodá and the\r\nOnón join to make the Shílka; the Shílka and the Argúñ join to make\r\nthe Amúr; and the Amúr joins the Sungarí to form that mighty stream\r\nwhich flows north-eastwards and enters the Pacific in the inhospitable\r\nlatitudes of the Tartar Strait.\r\n\r\nUp to the year 1864 the great river of Manchuria remained very little\r\nknown. All information about it dated from the times of the Jesuits,\r\nand that was scanty. Now that a revival in the exploration of Mongolia\r\nand Manchuria was going to take place, and the fear of China which had\r\nhitherto been entertained in Russia appeared to be exaggerated, all of\r\nus younger people pressed upon the Governor-General the necessity of\r\nexploring the Sungarí. To have next door to the Amúr an immense region\r\nalmost as little known as an African desert seemed to us provoking.\r\nQuite unexpectedly, General Korsákoff decided that same autumn to send\r\na steamer up the Sungarí, under the pretext of carrying some message of\r\nfriendship to the Governor-General of the Ghirín province. A Russian\r\nconsul from Urgá had to take the message. A doctor, an astronomer, two\r\ntopographers, and myself, all placed under the command of a Colonel\r\nChernyáeff, had to take part in the expedition on board a tiny steamer,\r\n_Usuri_, which had in tow a barge with coal. Twenty-five soldiers,\r\nwhose rifles were carefully concealed in the coal, went with us on the\r\nbarge.\r\n\r\nAll was organized very hurriedly, and there was no accommodation on the\r\nsmall steamer to receive such a numerous company; but we were all full\r\nof enthusiasm, and huddled as best we could in the tiny cabins. One of\r\nus had to sleep on a table, and when we started we found that there\r\nwere even no knives and forks for all of us--not to speak of other\r\nnecessaries. One of us resorted to his penknife at dinner time, and\r\nmy Chinese knife with two ivory sticks was a welcome addition to our\r\nequipment.\r\n\r\nIt was not an easy task to go up the Sungarí. The great river, in its\r\nlower parts, where it flows through the same lowlands as the Amúr, is\r\nvery shallow, and, although our steamer had only three feet draught,\r\nwe often could not find a channel deep enough to pass through. There\r\nwere days when we advanced but some forty miles, and scraped many times\r\nthe sandy bottom of the river with our keel; over and over again a\r\nrowing boat was sent out to find the necessary depth. But our young\r\ncaptain had made up his mind that he would reach Ghirín this autumn,\r\nand we progressed every day. As we advanced higher and higher up we\r\nfound the river more and more beautiful, and more and more easy for\r\nnavigation; and when we had passed the sandy deserts at its junction\r\nwith its sister-river, the Nónni, navigation became easy and pleasant.\r\nIn a few weeks we reached the capital of this province of Manchuria. An\r\nexcellent map of the river was made by the topographers.\r\n\r\nThere was no time, unfortunately, to spare, and so we very seldom\r\nlanded in any village or town. The villages are few and rare along the\r\nbanks of the river, and in its lower parts we found only lowlands,\r\nwhich are inundated every year. Higher up we sailed for a hundred miles\r\namidst sand dunes. It was only when we reached the upper Sungarí and\r\nbegan to approach Ghirín that we found a dense population.\r\n\r\nIf our aim had been to establish friendly relations with Manchuria--and\r\nnot simply to learn what the Sungarí is--our expedition ought to have\r\nbeen considered a dead failure. The Manchurian authorities had it fresh\r\nin their memories how, eight years before, the ‘visit’ of Muravióff\r\nended in the annexation of the Amúr and the Usurí, and they could\r\nnot but look with suspicion on these new and uncalled-for visitors.\r\nThe twenty-five rifles concealed in the coal, which had been duly\r\nreported to the Chinese authorities before we left, still more provoked\r\ntheir suspicions; and when our steamer cast her anchor in front of\r\nthe populous city of Ghirín we found all its merchants armed with\r\nrusty swords, unearthed from some old arsenal. We were not prevented,\r\nhowever, from walking in the streets, but all shops were closed as soon\r\nas we landed and the merchants were not allowed to sell anything. Some\r\nprovisions were sent on board the steamer--as a gift, but no money was\r\ntaken in return.\r\n\r\nThe autumn was rapidly coming to its end, the frosts began already,\r\nand we had to hurry back, as we could not winter on the Sungarí. In\r\nshort, we saw Ghirín, but spoke to none but the couple of interpreters\r\nwho came every morning on board our steamer. Our aim, however, was\r\nfulfilled. We had ascertained that the river is navigable, and a\r\ndetailed map of it was made, from its mouth to Ghirín, with the aid\r\nof which we were able to steam on our return journey at full speed\r\nwithout any accident. Our steamer only once touched the ground. But the\r\nGhirín authorities, desirous above all that we should not be compelled\r\nto winter on the river, sent us two hundred Chinese, who aided us in\r\ngetting off the sands. When I jumped into the water and, also taking a\r\nstick, began to sing our river song, ‘_Dubínushka_,’ which helps all\r\npresent to give a sudden push at the same moment, the Chinese enjoyed\r\nimmensely the fun of it, and after several such pushes the steamer was\r\nsoon afloat. The most cordial relations were established after this\r\nlittle adventure between ourselves and the Chinese--I mean, of course,\r\nthe people, who seemed to dislike very much their arrogant Manchurian\r\nofficials.\r\n\r\nWe called at several Chinese villages peopled with exiles from the\r\ncelestial empire, and we were received in the most cordial way.\r\nOne evening especially impressed itself on my memory. We came to a\r\nsmall, picturesque village as night was already falling. Some of us\r\nlanded, and I went alone through the village. A thick crowd of a\r\nhundred Chinese soon surrounded me, and although I knew not a word of\r\ntheir tongue, and they knew no more of mine, we chatted in the most\r\namicable way by mimicry and we understood each other. To pat one on the\r\nshoulders in sign of friendship is decidedly international language.\r\nTo offer each other tobacco and to be offered a light is again an\r\ninternational expression of friendship. One thing interested them--why\r\nhad I, though young, a beard? They wear none before they are sixty. And\r\nwhen I told them by signs that in case I should have nothing to eat I\r\nmight eat it--the joke was transmitted from one to the other through\r\nthe whole crowd. They roared with laughter, and began to pat me even\r\nmore caressingly on the shoulders; they took me about, showing me their\r\nhouses, everyone offered me his pipe, and the whole crowd accompanied\r\nme as a friend to the steamer. I must say that there was not one\r\nsingle _boshkó_ (policeman) in that village. In other villages our\r\nsoldiers and the young officers always made friends with the Chinese,\r\nbut as soon as a _boshkó_ appeared all was spoiled. In return, one must\r\nhave seen what ‘faces’ they used to make at the _boshkó_ behind his\r\nback! They evidently hated these representatives of authority.\r\n\r\nOur expedition has since been forgotten. The astronomer, Th. Usóltzeff,\r\nand I published reports about it in the ‘Memoirs’ of the Siberian\r\nGeographical Society; but a few years later a great conflagration\r\nat Irkútsk destroyed all the copies left of the Memoirs as well as\r\nthe original map of the Sungarí, and it was only last year, when the\r\nTrans-Manchurian railway began to be built, that Russian geographers\r\nunearthed our reports, and found that the great river had been explored\r\nfive-and-thirty years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nAs there was nothing more to be done in the direction of reform,\r\nI tried to do what seemed to be possible under the existing\r\ncircumstances--only to become convinced of the absolute uselessness of\r\nsuch efforts. In my new capacity of attaché to the Governor-General for\r\nCossack affairs, I made, for instance, a most thorough investigation of\r\nthe economical condition of the Usurí Cossacks, whose crops used to be\r\nlost every year, so that the government had every winter to feed them\r\nin order to save them from famine. When I returned from the Usurí with\r\nmy report, I received congratulations on all sides, I was promoted,\r\nI got special rewards. All the measures I recommended were accepted,\r\nand special grants of money were given for aiding the emigration of\r\nsome and for supplying cattle to others, as I had suggested. But the\r\npractical realization of the measures went into the hands of some\r\nold drunkard, who would squander the money and pitilessly flog the\r\nunfortunate Cossacks for the purpose of converting them into good\r\nagriculturists. And thus it went on in all directions, beginning with\r\nthe winter palace at St. Petersburg and ending with the Usurí and\r\nKamchátka.\r\n\r\nThe higher administration of Siberia was influenced by excellent\r\nintentions, and I can only repeat that, everything considered, it\r\nwas far better, far more enlightened, and far more interested in the\r\nwelfare of the people than the administration of any other province of\r\nRussia. But it was an administration--a branch of the tree which had\r\nits roots at St. Petersburg--and that was enough to paralyze all its\r\nexcellent intentions, enough to make it interfere with and kill all\r\nthe beginnings of local life and progress. Whatever was started for\r\nthe good of the country by local men was looked at with distrust, and\r\nwas immediately paralyzed by hosts of difficulties which came, not so\r\nmuch from the bad intentions of the administrators, but simply from\r\nthe fact that these officials belonged to a pyramidal, centralized\r\nadministration. The very fact of their belonging to a government which\r\nradiated from a distant capital caused them to look upon everything\r\nfrom the point of view of functionaries of the government, who think\r\nfirst of all about what their superiors will say, and how this or that\r\nwill appear in the administrative machinery. The interests of the\r\ncountry are a secondary matter.\r\n\r\nGradually I turned my energy more and more toward scientific\r\nexploration. In 1865 I explored the western Sayáns, where I caught\r\na new glimpse of the structure of the Siberian highlands and came\r\nupon another important volcanic region on the Chinese frontier; and\r\nfinally, the year following, I undertook a long journey to discover a\r\ndirect communication between the gold mines of the Yakútsk province\r\n(on the Vitím and the Olókma) and Transbaikália. For many years the\r\nmembers of the Siberian expedition (1860-1864) had tried to find\r\nsuch a passage, and had endeavoured to cross the series of very wild,\r\nstony parallel ridges which separate these mines from the plains of\r\nTransbaikália; but when, coming from the south, they reached that\r\ngloomy mountain region, and saw before them the dreary mountains\r\nspreading for hundreds of miles northward, all of these explorers, save\r\none who was killed by natives, returned southward. It was evident that\r\nin order to be successful the expedition had to move from the north\r\nto the south--from the dreary unknown wilderness to the warmer and\r\npopulated regions. It so happened, also, that while I was preparing\r\nfor the expedition I was shown a map which a Tungus had traced with\r\nhis knife on a piece of bark. This little map--a splendid specimen,\r\nby the way, of the usefulness of the geometrical sense in the lowest\r\nstages of civilization, and one which would consequently interest A.\r\nR. Wallace--so struck me by its seeming truth to nature that I fully\r\ntrusted to it, and began my journey from the north, following the\r\nindications of the map.\r\n\r\nIn company with a young and promising naturalist, Polakóff, and a\r\ntopographer, we went first down the Léna to the northern gold mines.\r\nThere we equipped the expedition, taking provisions for three months,\r\nand started southward. An old Yakút hunter, who twenty years before\r\nhad once followed the passage indicated in the Tungus map, undertook\r\nto act for us as a guide and to cross the mountain region--250 miles\r\nwide--following the river-valleys and gorges indicated by the Tungus\r\nwith his knife on the birch-bark map. He really accomplished that\r\nastounding feat, although there was no track of any sort to follow,\r\nand all the valleys that one saw from the top of a mountain pass,\r\nall equally covered with wood, seemed to be absolutely alike to the\r\nunpractised eye. This time the passage was found. For three months we\r\nwandered in the almost totally uninhabited mountain deserts and over\r\nthe marshy plateau, till at last we reached our destination, Chitá. I\r\nam told that this passage is now of value for bringing cattle from the\r\nsouth to the gold mines; as for me, the journey helped me immensely\r\nafterwards in finding the key to the structure of the mountains and\r\nplateaus of Siberia--but I am not writing a book of travel, and must\r\nstop.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe years that I spent in Siberia taught me many lessons which I\r\ncould hardly have learned elsewhere. I soon realized the absolute\r\nimpossibility of doing anything really useful for the masses of the\r\npeople by means of the administrative machinery. With this illusion\r\nI parted for ever. Then I began to understand not only men and human\r\ncharacter, but also the inner springs of the life of human society.\r\nThe constructive work of the unknown masses, which so seldom finds\r\nany mention in books, and the importance of that constructive work in\r\nthe growth of forms of society, appeared before my eyes in a clear\r\nlight. To witness, for instance, the ways in which the communities of\r\nDukhobórtsy (brothers of those who are now settling in Canada, and who\r\nfound such a hearty support in England and the United States) migrated\r\nto the Amúr region; to see the immense advantages which they got from\r\ntheir semi-communistic brotherly organization; and to realize what\r\na success their colonization was, amidst all the failures of State\r\ncolonization, was learning something which cannot be learned from\r\nbooks. Again, to live with natives, to see at work the complex forms\r\nof social organization which they have elaborated far away from the\r\ninfluence of any civilization, was, as it were, to store up floods\r\nof light which illuminated my subsequent reading. The part which the\r\nunknown masses play in the accomplishment of all important historical\r\nevents, and even in war, became evident to me from direct observation,\r\nand I came to hold ideas similar to those which Tolstóy expresses\r\nconcerning the leaders and the masses in his monumental work, ‘War and\r\nPeace.’\r\n\r\nHaving been brought up in a serf-owner’s family, I entered active life,\r\nlike all young men of my time, with a great deal of confidence in the\r\nnecessity of commanding, ordering, scolding, punishing, and the like.\r\nBut when, at an early stage, I had to manage serious enterprises and\r\nto deal with men, and when each mistake would lead at once to heavy\r\nconsequences, I began to appreciate the difference between acting on\r\nthe principle of command and discipline, and acting on the principle of\r\ncommon understanding. The former works admirably in a military parade,\r\nbut it is worth nothing where real life is concerned and the aim can\r\nbe achieved only through the severe effort of many converging wills.\r\nAlthough I did not then formulate my observations in terms borrowed\r\nfrom party struggles, I may say now that I lost in Siberia whatever\r\nfaith in State discipline I had cherished before. I was prepared to\r\nbecome an anarchist.\r\n\r\nFrom the age of nineteen to twenty-five I had to work out important\r\nschemes of reform, to deal with hundreds of men on the Amúr, to\r\nprepare and to make risky expeditions with ridiculously small means,\r\nand so on; and if all these things ended more or less successfully,\r\nI account for it only by the fact that I soon understood that in\r\nserious work commanding and discipline are of little avail. Men of\r\ninitiative are required everywhere; but once the impulse has been\r\ngiven, the enterprise must be conducted, especially in Russia, not in\r\nmilitary fashion, but in a sort of communal way, by means of common\r\nunderstanding. I wish that all framers of plans of State discipline\r\ncould pass through the school of real life before they begin to frame\r\ntheir State Utopias: we should then hear far less than at present of\r\nschemes of military and pyramidal organization of society.\r\n\r\nWith all that, life in Siberia became less and less attractive for\r\nme, although my brother Alexander had joined me in 1864 at Irkútsk,\r\nwhere he commanded a squadron of Cossacks. We were happy to be\r\ntogether; we read a great deal and discussed all the philosophical,\r\nscientific, and sociological questions of the day; but we both longed\r\nafter intellectual life, and there was none in Siberia. The occasional\r\npassage through Irkútsk of Raphael Pumpelly or of Adolph Bastian--the\r\nonly two men of science who visited our capital during my stay\r\nthere--was quite an event for both of us. The scientific and especially\r\nthe political life of Western Europe, of which we heard through the\r\npapers, attracted us, and the return to Russia was the subject to\r\nwhich we continually came back in our conversations. Finally, the\r\ninsurrection of the Polish exiles in 1866 opened our eyes to the false\r\nposition we both occupied as officers of the Russian army.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nI was far away in the Vitím mountains when some Polish exiles, who were\r\nemployed in piercing a new road in the cliffs round Lake Baikál, made\r\na desperate attempt to break their chains and to force their way to\r\nChina across Mongolia. Troops were sent out against them, and a Russian\r\nofficer was killed by the insurgents. I heard of it on my return to\r\nIrkútsk, where some fifty Poles were to be tried by a court-martial.\r\nThe sittings of courts-martial being open in Russia, I followed\r\nthis, taking detailed notes of the proceedings, which I sent to a\r\nSt. Petersburg paper, and which were published in full, to the great\r\ndissatisfaction of the Governor-General.\r\n\r\nEleven thousand Poles, men and women, had been transported to East\r\nSiberia in consequence of the insurrection of 1863. They were chiefly\r\nstudents, artists, ex-officers, nobles, and especially skilled\r\nartisans from the intelligent and highly developed working-men’s\r\npopulation of Warsaw and other towns. A great number of them were\r\nkept in hard labour, while the remainder were settled all over the\r\ncountry in villages where they could find no work whatever and lived\r\nin a state of semi-starvation. Those who were condemned to hard labour\r\nworked either at Chitá, building the barges for the Amúr--these were\r\nthe happiest--or in iron works of the Crown, or in salt works. I saw\r\nsome of the latter, on the Léna, standing half-naked in a shanty, round\r\nan immense cauldron filled with salt-brine, and mixing the thick,\r\nboiling brine with long shovels, in an infernal temperature, while the\r\ngates of the shanty were wide open to make a strong current of glacial\r\nair. After two years of such work these martyrs were sure to die from\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\nLately, a considerable number of Polish exiles were employed as\r\nnavvies building a road along the southern coast of Lake Baikál. This\r\nnarrow Alpine lake, four hundred miles long, surrounded by beautiful\r\nmountains rising three to five thousand feet above its level, cuts off\r\nTransbaikália and the Amúr from Irkútsk. In winter it may be crossed\r\nover the ice and in summer there are steamers, but for six weeks in\r\nthe spring and another six weeks in the autumn the only means to reach\r\nChitá and Kyákhta (for Pekin) from Irkútsk was to travel on horseback\r\na long circuitous route, across mountains 7,000 to 8,000 feet in\r\naltitude. I once travelled along this track, greatly enjoying the\r\nscenery of the mountains, which were snow-clad in May, but otherwise\r\nthe journey was really awful. To climb eight miles only, to the top of\r\nthe main pass, Khamár-dabán, it took me the whole day from three in the\r\nmorning till eight at night. Our horses continually fell through the\r\nthawing snow, plunging with the rider many times a day into icy water\r\nwhich flowed underneath the snow-crust. It was decided accordingly to\r\nbuild a permanent road along the southern coast of the lake, blowing\r\nup a passage in the steep, almost vertical cliffs which rise along\r\nthe shore, and spanning with bridges a hundred wild torrents which\r\nfuriously rush from the mountains into the lake. Polish exiles were\r\nemployed at this hard work.\r\n\r\nSeveral batches of Russian political exiles had been sent during the\r\nlast century to Siberia, but, with the submissiveness to fate which\r\nis characteristic of the Russians, they never revolted; they allowed\r\nthemselves to be killed inch by inch, without ever attempting to free\r\nthemselves. The Poles, on the contrary--this must be said to their\r\nhonour--were never so submissive as that, and this time they broke into\r\nopen revolt. They evidently had no chance of success--they revolted\r\nnevertheless. They had before them the great lake, and behind them a\r\ngirdle of absolutely impracticable mountains, beyond which begin the\r\nwildernesses of North Mongolia; but they nevertheless conceived the\r\nidea of disarming the soldiers who guarded them, forging those terrible\r\nweapons of the Polish insurrections--scythes planted as pikes on long\r\npoles--and making their way across the mountains and across Mongolia,\r\ntowards China, where they would find English ships to take them. One\r\nday the news came to Irkútsk that part of those Poles who were at work\r\non the Baikál road had disarmed a dozen soldiers and broken out into\r\nrevolt. Eighty soldiers were all that could be despatched against them\r\nfrom Irkútsk. Crossing the lake in a steamer, they went to meet the\r\ninsurgents on the other side of the lake.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1866 had been unusually dull at Irkútsk. In the Siberian\r\ncapital there is no such distinction between the different classes\r\nas one sees in Russian provincial towns; and the Irkútsk ‘society,’\r\ncomposed of numerous officers and officials, together with the wives\r\nand daughters of local traders and even clergymen, met during the\r\nwinter, every Thursday, at the Assembly Rooms. This winter, however,\r\nthere was no ‘go’ in the evening parties. Amateur theatricals, too,\r\nwere not successful; and gambling, which was usually pursued on a grand\r\nscale at Irkútsk, only dragged just along: a want of money was felt\r\nthis winter among the officials, and even the arrival of several mining\r\nofficers did not bring with it the heaps of bank-notes with which\r\nthese privileged gentlemen usually enlivened the knights of the green\r\ntables. The season was decidedly dull--just the season for starting\r\nspiritualistic experiences with talking tables and talkative spirits.\r\nA gentleman who had been during the previous winter the pet of Irkútsk\r\nsociety on account of the tales which he recited with great talent,\r\nseeing that interest in himself and his tales was failing, now took\r\nto spiritualism as a new amusement. He was clever, and in a week’s\r\ntime the Irkútsk ladies were mad over talking spirits. A new life\r\nwas infused amongst those who did not know how to kill time. Talking\r\ntables appeared in every drawing-room, and love-making went hand in\r\nhand with spirit rapping. An officer, whom I will call Pótaloff, took\r\nit all in deadly earnest--talking tables and love. Perhaps he was less\r\nfortunate with the latter than with the tables; at any rate, when the\r\nnews of the Polish insurrection came he asked to be sent to the spot\r\nwith the eighty soldiers. He hoped to return with a halo of military\r\nglory. ‘I go against the Poles,’ he wrote in his diary; ‘it would be so\r\ninteresting to be slightly wounded!’\r\n\r\nHe was killed. He rode on horseback by the side of the Colonel who\r\ncommanded the soldiers, when ‘the battle with the insurgents’--the\r\nglowing description of which may be found in the annals of the General\r\nStaff--began. The soldiers slowly advanced along the road, when they\r\nmet some fifty Poles, five or six of whom were armed with rifles and\r\nthe remainder with sticks and scythes; they occupied the forest, and\r\nfrom time to time fired their guns. The chain of soldiers did the\r\nsame. Lieutenant Pótaloff twice asked permission of the Colonel to\r\ndismount and to dash into the forest. The Colonel very angrily ordered\r\nhim to stay where he was. Notwithstanding this, the next moment the\r\nLieutenant had disappeared. Several shots resounded in the wood,\r\nfollowed by wild cries; the soldiers rushed that way, and found the\r\nLieutenant bleeding on the grass. The Poles fired their last shots and\r\nsurrendered; the battle was over, Pótaloff was dead. He had rushed,\r\nrevolver in hand, into the thicket, where he found several Poles armed\r\nwith pikes. He fired all his shots at them in a haphazard way, wounding\r\none of them, whereupon the others rushed upon him with their pikes.\r\n\r\nAt the other end of the road, on this side of the lake, two Russian\r\nofficers behaved in the most abominable way towards those Poles who\r\nwere building the same road but took no part in the insurrection. One\r\nof the two officers rushed into their tent, swearing and shooting at\r\nthe peaceful convicts with his revolver, badly wounding two of them.\r\n\r\nNow, the logic of the Siberian military authorities was that as a\r\nRussian officer had been killed several Poles had to be executed. The\r\ncourt-martial condemned five of them to death: Szaramówicz, a pianist,\r\na handsome man of thirty who was the leader of the insurrection;\r\nCelínski, an ex-officer of the Russian army, a man of sixty, because\r\nhe had once been an officer; and three others whose names I do not\r\nremember.\r\n\r\nThe Governor-General telegraphed to St. Petersburg asking permission to\r\nreprieve the condemned insurgents, but no answer came. He had promised\r\nus not to execute them, but after having waited several days for the\r\nreply, he ordered the sentence to be carried out secretly early in\r\nthe morning. The reply from St. Petersburg came four weeks later,\r\nby post: the Governor was left to act ‘according to the best of his\r\nunderstanding.’ In the meantime five brave men had been shot.\r\n\r\nThe insurrection, people said, was foolish. And yet this handful of\r\ninsurgents obtained something. The news of it reached Europe. The\r\nexecutions, the brutalities of the two officers, which became known\r\nthrough the proceedings of the court, produced a commotion in Austria,\r\nand Austria interfered in favour of the Galicians who had taken part\r\nin the revolution of 1863 and had been sent to Siberia. Soon after\r\nthe Baikál insurrection the fate of the Polish exiles in Siberia was\r\nsubstantially bettered, and they owed it to their insurgents--to those\r\nfive brave men who were shot at Irkútsk, and those who had taken arms\r\nby their side.\r\n\r\nFor my brother and myself this insurrection was a great lesson. We\r\nrealized what it meant to belong in any way to the army. I was away;\r\nbut my brother was at Irkútsk, and his squadron was dispatched against\r\nthe insurgents. Happily, the commander of the regiment to which my\r\nbrother belonged knew him well, and, under some pretext, he ordered\r\nanother officer to take command of the mobilized part of the squadron.\r\nOtherwise Alexander, of course, would have refused to march. If I had\r\nbeen at Irkútsk, I should have done the same.\r\n\r\nWe decided, then, to leave the military service and to return to\r\nRussia. This was not an easy matter, especially as Alexander had\r\nmarried in Siberia; but at last all was arranged, and early in 1867 we\r\nwere on our way to St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART FOURTH\r\n\r\nST. PETERSBURG--FIRST JOURNEY TO WESTERN EUROPE\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nEarly in the autumn of 1867 my brother and I, with his family, were\r\nsettled at St. Petersburg. I entered the university, and sat on the\r\nbenches among young men, almost boys, much younger than myself. What I\r\nhad so longed for five years before was accomplished: I could study;\r\nand, acting upon the idea that a thorough training in mathematics is\r\nthe only solid basis for all subsequent scientific work and thought, I\r\njoined the physico-mathematical faculty in its mathematical section.\r\nMy brother entered the Military Academy for Jurisprudence, whilst I\r\nentirely gave up military service, to the great dissatisfaction of my\r\nfather, who hated the very sight of a civilian dress. We both had now\r\nto rely entirely upon ourselves.\r\n\r\nStudy at the university and scientific work absorbed all my time for\r\nthe next five years. A student of the mathematical faculty has, of\r\ncourse, very much to do, but my previous studies in higher mathematics\r\npermitted me to devote part of my time to geography; and, moreover, I\r\nhad not lost in Siberia the habit of hard work.\r\n\r\nThe report of my last expedition was in print; but in the meantime a\r\nvast problem rose before me. The journeys that I had made in Siberia\r\nhad convinced me that the mountains which at that time were drawn on\r\nthe maps of Northern Asia were mostly fantastic, and gave no idea\r\nwhatever of the structure of the country. The great plateaux which\r\nare so prominent a feature of Asia were not even suspected by those\r\nwho drew the maps. Instead of them several great ridges, such as,\r\nfor instance, the eastern portion of the Stanovói, which used to be\r\ndrawn on the maps as a black worm creeping eastward, had grown up\r\nin the topographic bureaux, contrary to the indications and even to\r\nthe sketches of such explorers as L. Schwartz. These ridges have no\r\nexistence in nature. The heads of the rivers which flow toward the\r\nArctic Ocean on the one side, and toward the Pacific on the other, lie\r\nintermingled on the surface of a vast plateau; they rise in the same\r\nmarshes. But, in the European topographer’s imagination, the highest\r\nmountain ridges must run along the chief water-partings, and the\r\ntopographers had drawn there the highest Alps, of which there is no\r\ntrace in reality. Many such imaginary mountains were made to intersect\r\nthe maps of Northern Asia in all directions.\r\n\r\nTo discover the true leading principles in the disposition of the\r\nmountains of Asia--the harmony of mountain formation--now became a\r\nquestion which for years absorbed my attention. For a considerable\r\ntime the old maps, and still more the generalizations of Alexander von\r\nHumboldt, who, after a long study of Chinese sources, had covered Asia\r\nwith a network of mountains running along the meridians and parallels,\r\nhampered me in my researches, until at last I saw that even Humboldt’s\r\ngeneralizations, stimulating though they had been, did not agree with\r\nthe facts.\r\n\r\nBeginning, then, with the beginning, in a purely inductive way, I\r\ncollected all the barometrical observations of previous travellers, and\r\nfrom them calculated hundreds of altitudes; I marked on a large-scale\r\nmap all geological and physical observations that had been made by\r\ndifferent travellers--the facts, not the hypotheses--and I tried to\r\nfind out what structural lines would answer best to the observed\r\nrealities. This preparatory work took me more than two years; and\r\nthen followed months of intense thought, in order to find out what\r\nthe bewildering chaos of scattered observations meant, until one day,\r\nall of a sudden, the whole became clear and comprehensible, as if it\r\nwere illuminated with a flash of light. The main structural lines\r\nof Asia are _not_ north and south, or west and east; they are from\r\nthe south-west to the north-east--just as, in the Rocky Mountains\r\nand the plateaux of America, the lines are north-west to south-east;\r\nonly secondary ridges shoot out north-west. Moreover the mountains of\r\nAsia are _not_ bundles of independent ridges, like the Alps, but are\r\nsubordinated to an immense plateau--an old continent which once pointed\r\ntowards Behring Strait. High border ridges have towered up along its\r\nfringes, and in the course of ages terraces, formed by later sediments,\r\nhave emerged from the sea, thus adding on both sides to the width of\r\nthat primitive backbone of Asia.\r\n\r\nThere are not many joys in human life equal to the joy of the sudden\r\nbirth of a generalization, illuminating the mind after a long period\r\nof patient research. What has seemed for years so chaotic, so\r\ncontradictory, and so problematic takes at once its proper position\r\nwithin an harmonious whole. Out of the wild confusion of facts and\r\nfrom behind the fog of guesses--contradicted almost as soon as they\r\nare born--a stately picture makes its appearance, like an Alpine chain\r\nsuddenly emerging in all its grandeur from the mists which concealed\r\nit the moment before, glittering under the rays of the sun in all its\r\nsimplicity and variety, in all its mightiness and beauty. And when the\r\ngeneralization is put to a test, by applying it to hundreds of separate\r\nfacts which seemed to be hopelessly contradictory the moment before,\r\neach of them assumes its due position, increasing the impressiveness\r\nof the picture, accentuating some characteristic outline, or adding\r\nan unsuspected detail full of meaning. The generalization gains in\r\nstrength and extent; its foundations grow in width and solidity; while\r\nin the distance, through the far-off mist on the horizon, the eye\r\ndetects the outlines of new and still wider generalizations.\r\n\r\nHe who has once in his life experienced this joy of scientific creation\r\nwill never forget it; he will be longing to renew it; and he cannot\r\nbut feel with pain that this sort of happiness is the lot of so few of\r\nus, while so many could also live through it--on a small or on a grand\r\nscale--if scientific methods and leisure were not limited to a handful\r\nof men.\r\n\r\nThis work I consider my chief contribution to science. My first\r\nintention was to produce a bulky volume, in which the new ideas about\r\nthe mountains and plateaux of Northern Asia should be supported by a\r\ndetailed examination of each separate region; but in 1873, when I saw\r\nthat I should soon be arrested, I only prepared a map which embodied\r\nmy views and wrote an explanatory paper. Both were published by the\r\nGeographical Society, under the supervision of my brother, while I\r\nwas already in the fortress of St. Peter and St. Paul. Petermann,\r\nwho was then preparing a map of Asia, and knew my preliminary work,\r\nadopted my scheme for his map, and it has been accepted since by most\r\ncartographers. The map of Asia, as it is now understood, explains, I\r\nbelieve, the main physical features of the great continent, as well\r\nas the distribution of its climates, faunas, and floras, and even its\r\nhistory. It reveals, also, as I was able to see during my last journey\r\nto America, striking analogies between the structure and the geological\r\ngrowth of the two continents of the northern hemisphere. Very few\r\ncartographers could say now whence all these changes in the map of Asia\r\nhave come; but in science it is better that new ideas should make their\r\nway independently of any name attached to them. The errors which are\r\nunavoidable in a first generalization are easier to rectify.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nAt the same time I worked a great deal for the Russian Geographical\r\nSociety in my capacity of secretary to its section of physical\r\ngeography.\r\n\r\nGreat interest was taken then in the exploration of Turkestan and the\r\nPamírs. Syévertsoff had just returned after several years of travel. A\r\ngreat zoologist, a gifted geographer, and one of the most intelligent\r\nmen I ever came across, he, like so many Russians, disliked writing.\r\nWhen he had made an oral communication at a meeting of the Society he\r\ncould not be induced to write anything beyond revising the reports\r\nof his communication, so that all that has been published under his\r\nsignature is very far from doing full justice to the real value of\r\nthe observations and the generalizations he had made. This reluctance\r\nto put down in writing the results of thought and observation is\r\nunfortunately not uncommon in Russia. His remarks on the orography of\r\nTurkestan, on the geographical distribution of plants and animals,\r\nand especially on the part played by hybrids in the production of new\r\nspecies of birds, which I have heard him make, or on the importance of\r\nmutual support in the progressive development of species which I have\r\nfound just mentioned in a couple of lines in some report of a meeting,\r\nbore the stamp of more than an ordinary talent and originality; but he\r\ndid not possess the exuberant force of exposition in an appropriately\r\nbeautiful form, which might have made of him one of the most prominent\r\nmen of science of our time.\r\n\r\nMiklúkho Makláy, well known in Australia, which towards the end of his\r\nlife became the country of his adoption, belonged to the same order\r\nof men--the men who have had so much more to say than they have said\r\nin print. He was a tiny, nervous man, always suffering from malaria,\r\nwho had just returned from the coasts of the Red Sea, when I made his\r\nacquaintance. A follower of Hæckel, he had worked a great deal upon\r\nthe marine invertebrates in their life surroundings. The Geographical\r\nSociety managed next to get him taken on board a Russian man-of-war\r\nto some unknown part of the coast of New Guinea, where he wanted to\r\nstudy the most primitive savages. Accompanied by one sailor only, he\r\nwas left on this inhospitable shore, the inhabitants of which had the\r\nreputation of being cannibals. A hut was built for the two Robinsons,\r\nand they lived eighteen months or more by the side of a native village\r\non excellent terms with the natives. Always to be straightforward\r\ntowards them, and never to deceive them--not even in the most trifling\r\nmatters--not even for scientific purposes--was his ethics. On this\r\npoint he was most scrupulous. When he was travelling some time later\r\non in the Malayan peninsula he had with him a native who had entered\r\ninto his service on the express condition of never being photographed.\r\nThe natives, as everyone knows, consider that something is taken out\r\nof them when their likeness is taken by photography. Makláy, who was\r\ncollecting anthropological materials, confessed that one day, when the\r\nman was fast asleep, he was awfully tempted to photograph him, the\r\nmore so as he was a typical representative of his tribe and he would\r\nhave never known that he had been photographed. But Makláy remembered\r\nhis promise and never did it. When he left New Guinea the natives\r\nmade him promise to return; and a few years later, although he was\r\nseverely ill, he kept his word and did return. This remarkable man has,\r\nhowever, published only an infinitesimal part of the truly invaluable\r\nobservations he had made.\r\n\r\nFédchenko, who had made extensive travels and zoological observations\r\nin Turkestan--in company with his wife, Olga Fédchenko, also a\r\nnaturalist--was, as we used to say, a ‘West European.’ He worked hard\r\nto bring out in an elaborated form the results of his observations; but\r\nhe was, unfortunately, killed in climbing a mountain in Switzerland.\r\nGlowing with youthful ardour after his journeys in the Turkestan\r\nmountains, and full of confidence in his own powers, he undertook an\r\nascent without proper guides, and perished in a snowstorm. His wife,\r\nhappily, completed the publication of his ‘Travels’ after his death,\r\nand I believe she has now a son who continues the work of his father\r\nand mother.\r\n\r\nI also saw a great deal of Prjeválsky, or rather Przewalski, as his\r\nPolish name ought to be spelt, although he himself preferred to appear\r\nas a ‘Russian patriot.’ He was a passionate hunter, and the enthusiasm\r\nwith which he made his explorations of Central Asia was almost as much\r\nthe result of his desire to hunt all sorts of difficult game--bucks,\r\nwild camels, wild horses, and so on--as of his desire to discover lands\r\nnew and difficult to approach. When he was induced to speak of his\r\ndiscoveries he would soon interrupt his modest descriptions with an\r\nenthusiastic exclamation: ‘But what game there! What hunting! ...’ and\r\nhe would describe passionately how he crept such and such a distance\r\nto approach a wild horse within shooting range. No sooner was he back\r\nat St. Petersburg than he schemed a new expedition, and parsimoniously\r\nlaid aside all his money, trying to increase it by Stock Exchange\r\noperations, for a new expedition. He was the type of a traveller\r\nby his strong physique and his capacity for enduring the life of a\r\nmountain hunter, full of privations. He delighted in leading such a\r\nlife. He made his first journey with only three comrades, and always\r\nkept on excellent terms with the natives. However, as his subsequent\r\nexpeditions took a more military character, he began unfortunately to\r\nrely upon the force of his armed escort in preference to a peaceful\r\nintercourse with the natives, and I heard it said in well-informed\r\nquarters that if he had not died at the very start of his Tibet\r\nexpedition--so admirably and peacefully conducted after his death by\r\nhis companions, Pyevtsóff, Roboróvsky, and Kozlóff--he very probably\r\nwould not have returned alive.\r\n\r\nThere was considerable activity at that time in the Geographical\r\nSociety, and numerous were the geographical questions in which our\r\nsection, and consequently its secretary, took a lively interest. Most\r\nof them were too technical to be mentioned in this place, but I must\r\nallude to the awakening of interest in navigation, in the fisheries\r\nand trade in the Russian portion of the Arctic Ocean, which took place\r\nin these years. A Siberian merchant and goldminer, Sídoroff, made the\r\nmost persevering efforts to awaken that interest. He foresaw that\r\nwith a little aid in the shape of naval schools, the exploration of\r\nthe Norman Coast and the White Sea, and so on, the Russian fisheries\r\nand Russian navigation could be largely developed. But unfortunately\r\nthat little had to be done all through St. Petersburg, and the ruling\r\nportion of that courtly, bureaucratic, red-tapist, literary, artistic,\r\nand cosmopolitan city could not be moved to take an interest in\r\nanything ‘provincial.’ Poor Sídoroff was simply ridiculed for his\r\nefforts. Interest in our far North had to be enforced upon the Russian\r\nGeographical Society from abroad.\r\n\r\nIn the years 1869-71 the bold Norwegian seal-hunters had quite\r\nunexpectedly opened the Kara Sea to navigation. To our extreme\r\nastonishment we learned one day at the Society that the sea which lies\r\nbetween the island of Nóvaya Zemlyá and the Siberian coast, and which\r\nwe used confidently to describe in our writings as ‘an ice cellar\r\npermanently stocked with ice’, had been entered by a number of small\r\nNorwegian schooners and crossed by them in all directions. Even the\r\nwintering place of the famous Dutchman Barentz, which we believed to\r\nbe concealed for ever from the eyes of man by ice-fields hundreds of\r\nyears old, had been visited by these adventurous Norsemen.\r\n\r\n‘Exceptional seasons and an exceptional state of the ice’ was what our\r\nelder navigators said. But to a few of us it was quite evident that,\r\nwith their small schooners and their small crews, the bold Norwegian\r\nhunters, who feel at home amid the ice, had ventured to pierce the\r\nfloating ice which usually bars the way to the Kara Sea, while the\r\ncommanders of Government ships, hampered by the responsibilities of the\r\nnaval service, had never risked doing so.\r\n\r\nA general interest in Arctic exploration was awakened by these\r\ndiscoveries. In fact, it was the seal-hunters who opened the new era of\r\nArctic enthusiasm which culminated in Nordenskjöld’s circumnavigation\r\nof Asia, in the permanent establishment of the north-eastern passage\r\nto Siberia, in Peary’s discovery of North Greenland, and in Nansen’s\r\n‘Fram’ expedition. Our Russian Geographical Society also began to move,\r\nand a committee was appointed to prepare the scheme of a Russian Arctic\r\nexpedition, and to indicate the scientific work that could be done\r\nby it. Specialists undertook to write each of the special scientific\r\nchapters of this report; but, as often happens, a few chapters\r\nonly--botany, geology, and meteorology--were ready in time, and I,\r\nas secretary of the committee, had to write the remainder. Several\r\nsubjects, such as marine zoology, the tides, pendulum observations, and\r\nterrestrial magnetism, were quite new to me; but the amount of work\r\nwhich a healthy man can accomplish in a short time, if he strains all\r\nhis forces and goes straight to the root of the subject, no one would\r\nsuppose beforehand--and so my report was ready.\r\n\r\nIt concluded by advocating a great Arctic expedition, which would\r\nawaken in Russia a permanent interest in Arctic questions and Arctic\r\nnavigation, and in the meantime a reconnoitring expedition on board\r\na schooner chartered in Norway with its captain, pushing north or\r\nnorth-east of Nóvaya Zemlyá. This expedition, we suggested, might\r\nalso try to reach, or at least to sight, an unknown land which must\r\nbe situated at no great distance from Nóvaya Zemlyá. The probable\r\nexistence of such a land had been indicated by an officer of the\r\nRussian navy, Baron Schilling, in an excellent but little known paper\r\non the currents in the Arctic Ocean. When I read this paper, as also\r\nLütke’s ‘Journey to Nóvaya Zemlyá,’ and made myself acquainted with the\r\ngeneral conditions of this part of the Arctic Ocean, I saw at once that\r\nthe supposition must be correct. There must be a land to the north-west\r\nof Nóvaya Zemlyá, and it must reach a higher latitude than Spitzbergen.\r\nThe steady position of the ice at the west of Nóvaya Zemlyá, the mud\r\nand stones on it, and various other smaller indications confirmed the\r\nhypothesis. Besides, if such a land were not located there, the ice\r\ncurrent which flows westward from the meridian of Behring Strait to\r\nGreenland (the current of the ‘Fram’s’ drift) would, as Baron Schilling\r\nhad truly remarked, reach the North Cape and cover the coasts of\r\nLaponia with masses of ice, just as it covers the northern extremity of\r\nGreenland. The warm current alone--a feeble continuation of the Gulf\r\nStream--could not have prevented the accumulation of ice on the coasts\r\nof Northern Europe. This land, as is known, was discovered a couple of\r\nyears later by the Austrian expedition, and named Franz Josef Land.\r\n\r\nThe Arctic report had a quite unexpected result for me. I was offered\r\nthe leadership of the reconnoitring expedition, on board a Norwegian\r\nschooner chartered for the purpose. I replied, of course, that I had\r\nnever been to sea; but I was told that by combining the experience of a\r\nCarlsen or a Johansen with the initiative of a man of science something\r\nvaluable could be done; and I should have accepted had not the Ministry\r\nof Finance at this juncture interposed with its veto. It replied that\r\nthe Exchequer could not grant the three or four thousand pounds which\r\nwould be required for the expedition. Since that time Russia has taken\r\nno part in the exploration of the Arctic seas. The land which we\r\ndistinguished through the subpolar mists was discovered by Payer and\r\nWeyprecht, and the archipelagoes which must exist to the north-east of\r\nNóvaya Zemlyá--I am even more firmly persuaded of it now than I was\r\nthen--remain undiscovered.\r\n\r\nInstead of joining an Arctic expedition I was sent out by the\r\nGeographical Society on a modest tour in Finland and Sweden, to explore\r\nthe glacial deposits; and that journey drifted me in a quite different\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nThe Russian Academy of Sciences sent out this summer two of its\r\nmembers--the old geologist General Helmersen and Friedrich Schmidt, the\r\nindefatigable explorer of Siberia--to study the structure of those long\r\nridges of drift which are known as _åsar_ in Sweden and Finland, and\r\nas _esker_, _kames_, and so on, in the British Isles. The Geographical\r\nSociety sent me to Finland for the same purpose. We visited, all three,\r\nthe beautiful ridge of Pungaharju and then separated. I worked hard\r\nduring this summer. I travelled a great deal in Finland, and crossed\r\nover to Sweden, where I spent many happy hours in the company of A.\r\nNordenskjöld. Already then (in 1871) he mentioned to me his schemes\r\nof reaching the mouths of the Siberian rivers, and even the Behring\r\nStrait, by the northern route. Returning to Finland I continued my\r\nresearches till late in the autumn, and collected a mass of most\r\ninteresting observations relative to the glaciation of the country.\r\nBut I also thought a great deal during this journey about social\r\nmatters, and these thoughts had a decisive influence upon my subsequent\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nAll sorts of valuable materials relative to the geography of Russia\r\npassed through my hands in the Geographical Society, and the idea\r\ngradually came to me of writing an exhaustive physical geography of\r\nthat immense part of the world. My intention was to give a thorough\r\ngeographical description of the country, basing it upon the main lines\r\nof the surface structure which I began to disentangle for European\r\nRussia; and to sketch in that description the different forms of\r\neconomic life which ought to prevail in different physical regions.\r\nTake, for instance, the wide prairies of Southern Russia, so often\r\nvisited by droughts and failures of crops. These droughts and failures\r\nmust not be treated as accidental calamities: they are as much a\r\nnatural feature of that region as its position on a southern slope,\r\nits fertility, and the rest; and the whole of the economic life of the\r\nsouthern prairies ought to be organized in prevision of the unavoidable\r\nrecurrence of periodical droughts. Each region of the Russian Empire\r\nought to be treated in the same scientific way, as Karl Ritter treated\r\nparts of Asia in his beautiful monographs.\r\n\r\nBut such a work would have required plenty of time and full freedom for\r\nthe writer, and I often thought how helpful to this end it would be\r\nwere I to occupy some day the position of secretary to the Geographical\r\nSociety. Now, in the autumn of 1871, as I was working in Finland,\r\nslowly moving on foot toward the sea coast along the newly built\r\nrailway, and closely watching the spot where the first unmistakable\r\ntraces of the former extension of the post-glacial sea would appear, I\r\nreceived a telegram from the Geographical Society: ‘The council begs\r\nyou to accept the position of secretary to the Society.’ At the same\r\ntime the outgoing secretary strongly urged me to accept the proposal.\r\n\r\nMy hopes were realized. But in the meantime other thoughts and other\r\nlongings had pervaded my mind. I seriously thought over the reply, and\r\nwired, ‘Most cordial thanks, but cannot accept.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nIt often happens that men pull in a certain political, social, or\r\nfamiliar harness simply because they never have time to ask themselves\r\nwhether the position they stand in and the work they accomplish are\r\nright; whether their occupations really suit their inner desires and\r\ncapacities, and give them the satisfaction which everyone has the right\r\nto expect from his work. Active men are especially liable to find\r\nthemselves in such a position. Every day brings with it a fresh batch\r\nof work, and a man throws himself into his bed late at night without\r\nhaving completed what he expected to have done; then in the morning\r\nhe hurries to the unfinished task of the previous day. Life goes, and\r\nthere is no time left to think, no time to consider the direction that\r\none’s life is taking. So it was with me.\r\n\r\nBut now, during my journey in Finland, I had leisure. When I was\r\ncrossing in a Finnish two-wheeled _karria_ some plain which offered\r\nno interest to the geologist, or when I was walking, hammer on\r\nshoulder, from one gravel pit to another, I could think; and, amidst\r\nthe undoubtedly interesting geological work I was carrying on, one\r\nidea, which appealed far more strongly to my inner self than geology,\r\npersistently worked in my mind.\r\n\r\nI saw what an immense amount of labour the Finnish peasant spends in\r\nclearing the land and in breaking up the hard boulder clay, and I said\r\nto myself, ‘I will write, let me say, the physical geography of this\r\npart of Russia, and tell the peasant the best means of cultivating\r\nthis soil. Here an American stump-extractor would be invaluable; there\r\ncertain methods of manuring would be indicated by science.... But what\r\nis the use of talking to this peasant about American machines, when he\r\nhas barely enough bread to live upon from one crop to the next; when\r\nthe rent which he has to pay for that boulder clay grows heavier and\r\nheavier in proportion to his success in improving the soil? He gnaws at\r\nhis hard-as-a-stone rye-flour cake, which he bakes twice a year; he has\r\nwith it a morsel of fearfully salted cod and a drink of skimmed milk.\r\nHow dare I talk to him of American machines, when all that he can raise\r\nmust be sold to pay rent and taxes? He needs me to live with him, to\r\nhelp him to become the owner or the free occupier of that land. Then he\r\nwill read books with profit, but not now.’\r\n\r\nAnd my thoughts wandered from Finland to our Nikólskoye peasants, whom\r\nI had lately seen. Now they are free, and they value freedom very much.\r\nBut they have no meadows. In one way or another the landlords have got\r\nnearly all the meadows for themselves. When I was a child the Savókhins\r\nused to send out six horses for night pasture; the Tolkachóffs had\r\nseven. Now these families have only three horses each; other families,\r\nwhich formerly had three horses, have only one or none. What can be\r\ndone with one miserable horse? No meadows, no horses, no manure! How\r\ncan I talk to them of grass-sowing? They are already ruined--poor as\r\nLazarus--and in a few years they will be made still poorer by a foolish\r\ntaxation. How happy they were when I told them that my father gave them\r\npermission to mow the grass in the small open spaces in his Kóstino\r\nforest! ‘Your Nikólskoye peasants are _ferocious_ for work,’ that is\r\nthe common saying about them in our neighbourhood; but the arable land,\r\nwhich our stepmother has taken out of their allotments in virtue of the\r\n‘law of minimum’--that diabolic clause introduced by the serf-owners\r\nwhen they were allowed to revise the emancipation law--is now a forest\r\nof thistles, and the ‘ferocious’ workers are not allowed to till it.\r\nAnd the same sort of thing goes on throughout Russia. Even at that time\r\nit was evident, and official commissioners gave warning of it, that\r\nthe first serious failure of crops in Middle Russia would result in a\r\nterrible famine--and famine came, in 1876, in 1884, in 1891, in 1895,\r\nand again in 1898.\r\n\r\nScience is an excellent thing. I knew its joys and valued them,\r\nperhaps more than many of my colleagues did. Even now, as I was\r\nlooking on the lakes and the hillocks of Finland, new and beautiful\r\ngeneralizations arose before my eyes. I saw in a remote past, at the\r\nvery dawn of mankind, the ice accumulating from year to year in the\r\nnorthern archipelagoes, over Scandinavia and Finland. An immense\r\ngrowth of ice invaded the north of Europe and slowly spread as far\r\nas its middle portions. Life dwindled in that part of the northern\r\nhemisphere, and, wretchedly poor, uncertain, it fled further and\r\nfurther south before the icy breath which came from that immense\r\nfrozen mass. Man--miserable, weak, ignorant--had every difficulty in\r\nmaintaining a precarious existence. Ages passed away, till the melting\r\nof the ice began, and with it came the lake period, when countless\r\nlakes were formed in the cavities, and a wretched subpolar vegetation\r\nbegan timidly to invade the unfathomable marshes with which every lake\r\nwas surrounded. Another series of ages passed before an extremely\r\nslow process of drying up set in, and vegetation began its slow\r\ninvasion from the south. And now we are fully in the period of a rapid\r\ndesiccation, accompanied by the formation of dry prairies and steppes,\r\nand man has to find out the means to put a check to that desiccation\r\nto which Central Asia already has fallen a victim, and which menaces\r\nSouth-Eastern Europe.\r\n\r\nBelief in an ice cap reaching Middle Europe was at that time rank\r\nheresy; but before my eyes a grand picture was rising, and I wanted\r\nto draw it, with the thousands of details I saw in it; to use it as a\r\nkey to the present distribution of floras and faunas; to open up new\r\nhorizons to geology and physical geography.\r\n\r\nBut what right had I to these higher joys, when all round me was\r\nnothing but misery and struggle for a mouldy bit of bread; when\r\nwhatsoever I should spend to enable me to live in that world of higher\r\nemotions must needs be taken from the very mouths of those who grew\r\nthe wheat and had not bread enough for their children? From somebody’s\r\nmouth it must be taken, because the aggregate production of mankind\r\nremains still so low.\r\n\r\nKnowledge is an immense power. Man must know. But we already know much!\r\nWhat if that knowledge--and only that--should become the possession of\r\nall? Would not science itself progress in leaps and cause mankind to\r\nmake strides in production, invention, and social creation, of which we\r\nare hardly in a condition now to measure the speed?\r\n\r\nThe masses want to know: they are willing to learn; they _can_ learn.\r\nThere, on the crest of that immense moraine which runs between the\r\nlakes, as if giants had heaped it up in a hurry to connect the two\r\nshores, there stands a Finnish peasant plunged in contemplation of the\r\nbeautiful lakes, studded with islands, which lie before him. Not one\r\nof these peasants, poor and downtrodden though they may be, will pass\r\nthis spot without stopping to admire the scene. Or there, on the shore\r\nof a lake, stands another peasant, and sings something so beautiful\r\nthat the best musician would envy him his melody for its feeling and\r\nits meditative power. Both deeply feel, both meditate, both think; they\r\nare ready to widen their knowledge: only give it to them; only give\r\nthem the means of getting leisure. This is the direction in which,\r\nand these are the kind of people for whom, I must work. All those\r\nsonorous phrases about making mankind progress, while at the same time\r\nthe progress-makers stand aloof from those whom they pretend to push\r\nonwards, are mere sophisms made up by minds anxious to shake off a\r\nfretting contradiction.\r\n\r\nSo I sent my negative reply to the Geographical Society.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nSt. Petersburg had changed greatly from what it was when I left it in\r\n1862. ‘Oh yes, you knew the St. Petersburg of Chernyshévsky,’ the poet\r\nMáikoff remarked to me once. True, I knew the St. Petersburg of which\r\nChernyshévsky was the favourite. But how shall I describe the city\r\nwhich I found on my return? Perhaps as the St. Petersburg of the _cafés\r\nchantants_, of the music halls, if the words ‘all St. Petersburg’ ought\r\nreally to mean the upper circles of society, which took their keynote\r\nfrom the Court.\r\n\r\nAt the Court, and in its circles, liberal ideas were in sorely bad\r\nrepute. All prominent men of the sixties, even such moderates as Count\r\nNicholas Muravióff and Nicholas Milútin, were treated as suspects.\r\nOnly Dmítri Milútin, the Minister of War, was kept by Alexander II. at\r\nhis post, because the reform which he had to accomplish in the army\r\nrequired many years for its realization. All other active men of the\r\nreform period had been brushed aside.\r\n\r\nI spoke once with a high dignitary of the Ministry for foreign affairs.\r\nHe sharply criticized another high functionary, and I remarked in the\r\nlatter’s defence, ‘Still there is this to be said for him, that he\r\nnever accepted service under Nicholas I.’ ‘And now he is in service\r\nunder the reign of Shuváloff and Trépoff!’ was the reply, which so\r\ncorrectly described the situation that I could say nothing more.\r\n\r\nGeneral Shuváloff, the chief of the State police, and General Trépoff,\r\nthe chief of the St. Petersburg police, were indeed the real rulers\r\nof Russia. Alexander II. was their executive, their tool. And they\r\nruled by fear. Trépoff had so frightened Alexander by the spectre of a\r\nrevolution which was going to break out at St. Petersburg, that if the\r\nomnipotent chief of the police was a few minutes late in appearing with\r\nhis daily report at the palace, the Emperor would ask, ‘Is everything\r\nquiet at St. Petersburg?’\r\n\r\nShortly after Alexander II, had given an ‘entire dismissal’ to Princess\r\nX. he conceived a warm friendship for General Fleury, the aide-de-camp\r\nof Napoleon III., that sinister man who was the soul of the _coup\r\nd’état_ of December 2, 1852. They were continually seen together,\r\nand Fleury once informed the Parisians of the great honour which was\r\nbestowed upon him by the Russian Tsar. As the latter was riding along\r\nthe Nevsky Perspective he saw Fleury, and asked him to mount into his\r\ncarriage, an _égoïste_ which had a seat only twelve inches wide, for a\r\nsingle person; and the French general recounted at length how the Tsar\r\nand he, holding fast to each other, had to leave half of their bodies\r\nhanging in the air on account of the narrowness of the seat. It is\r\nenough to name this friend, fresh from Compiègne, to suggest what the\r\nfriendship meant.\r\n\r\nShuváloff took every advantage of the present state of mind of his\r\nmaster. He prepared one reactionary measure after another, and when\r\nAlexander showed reluctance to sign any of them Shuváloff would speak\r\nof the coming revolution and the fate of Louis XVI., and, ‘for the\r\nsalvation of the dynasty,’ would implore him to sign the new additions\r\nto the laws of repression. For all that sadness and remorse would from\r\ntime to time besiege Alexander. He would fall into a gloomy melancholy,\r\nand speak in a sad tone of the brilliant beginning of his reign, and\r\nof the reactionary character which it was taking. Then Shuváloff would\r\norganize an especially lively bear hunt. Hunters, merry courtiers, and\r\ncarriages full of ballet girls would go to the forests of Nóvgorod. A\r\ncouple of bears would be killed by Alexander II., who was a good shot\r\nand used to let the animal approach to within a few yards of his rifle;\r\nand there, in the excitement of the hunting festivities, Shuváloff\r\nwould obtain his master’s consent to any scheme of repression which he\r\nhad concocted.\r\n\r\nAlexander II. certainly was not a rank and file man, but two different\r\nmen lived in him, both strongly developed, struggling with each other;\r\nand this inner struggle became more and more violent as he advanced in\r\nage. He could be charming in his behaviour, and the next moment display\r\nsheer brutality. He was possessed of a calm, reasoned courage in the\r\nface of a real danger, but he lived in constant fear of dangers which\r\nexisted in his brain only. He assuredly was not a coward; he would meet\r\na bear face to face; on one occasion, when the animal was not killed\r\noutright by his first bullet, and the man who stood behind him with a\r\nlance, rushing forward, was knocked down by the bear, the Tsar came\r\nto his rescue, and killed the bear close to the muzzle of his gun (I\r\nknow this from the man himself); yet he was haunted all his life by the\r\nfears of his own imagination and of an uneasy conscience. He was very\r\nkind in his manner toward his friends, but that kindness existed side\r\nby side with the terrible cold-blooded cruelty--a seventeenth-century\r\ncruelty--which he displayed in crushing the Polish insurrection, and\r\nlater on in 1880, when similar measures were taken to crush the revolt\r\nof the Russian youth--a cruelty of which no one would have thought him\r\ncapable. He thus lived a double life, and at the period of which I am\r\nspeaking he merrily signed the most reactionary decrees, and afterward\r\nbecame despondent about them. Towards the end of his life this inner\r\nstruggle, as will be seen later on, became still stronger, and assumed\r\nan almost tragical character.\r\n\r\nIn 1872 Shuváloff was nominated ambassador in England, but his friend\r\nGeneral Potápoff continued the same policy till the beginning of\r\nthe Turkish war in 1877. During all this time the most scandalous\r\nplundering of the State exchequer, and also of the Crown lands, of the\r\nestates confiscated in Lithuania after the insurrection, of the Bashkir\r\nlands in Orenbúrg, and so on, was proceeding on a grand scale. Several\r\nsuch scandals were subsequently brought to light and some of them were\r\njudged by the Senate, acting as high court of justice, after Potápoff,\r\nwho became insane, and Trépoff had been dismissed, and their rivals at\r\nthe palace wanted to show them to Alexander II. in their true light. In\r\none of these judicial inquiries it came out that a friend of Potápoff\r\nhad most shamelessly robbed the peasants of a Lithuanian estate of\r\ntheir lands, and afterward, empowered by his friends at the Ministry\r\nof the Interior, he had caused the peasants, who sought redress, to\r\nbe imprisoned, subjected to wholesale flogging, and shot down by the\r\ntroops. This was one of the most revolting stories of the kind even\r\nin the annals of Russia, which teem with similar robberies up to the\r\npresent time. It was only after Véra Zasúlich had shot at Trépoff\r\nand wounded him (to avenge his having ordered one of the political\r\nprisoners to be flogged in prison) that the thefts of this party became\r\nwidely known and Trépoff was dismissed. Thinking he was going to die,\r\nhe wrote his will, from which it became known that this man, who had\r\nmade the Tsar believe he was poor, even though he had occupied for\r\nyears the lucrative post of chief of the St. Petersburg police, left in\r\nreality to his heirs a considerable fortune. Some courtiers carried the\r\nreport to Alexander II. Trépoff lost his credit, and it was then that\r\na few of the robberies of the Shuváloff-Potápoff-Trépoff party were\r\nbrought before the Senate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe pillage which went on in all the ministries, especially in\r\nconnection with the railways and all sorts of industrial enterprises,\r\nwas really enormous. Immense fortunes were made at that time. The navy,\r\nas Alexander II. himself said to one of his sons, was ‘in the pockets\r\nof So-and-so.’ The cost of the railways, guaranteed by the State, was\r\nsimply fabulous. As to commercial enterprises, it was openly known that\r\nnone could be launched unless a specified percentage of the dividends\r\nwas promised to different functionaries in the several ministries.\r\nA friend of mine, who intended to start some enterprise at St.\r\nPetersburg, was frankly told at the Ministry of the Interior that he\r\nwould have to pay twenty-five per cent. of the net profits to a certain\r\nperson, fifteen per cent. to one man at the Ministry of Finances, ten\r\nper cent. to another man in the same ministry, and five per cent.\r\nto a fourth person. The bargains were made without concealment, and\r\nAlexander II. knew it. His own remarks, written on the reports of the\r\nComptroller-General, bear testimony to this. But he saw in the thieves\r\nhis protectors from the revolution, and kept them until their robberies\r\nbecame an open scandal.\r\n\r\nThe young grand dukes, with the exception of the heir-apparent,\r\nafterwards Alexander III., who always was a good and thrifty\r\n_paterfamilias_, followed the example of the head of the family. The\r\norgies which one of them used to arrange in a small restaurant on\r\nthe Nevsky Perspective were so degradingly notorious that one night\r\nthe chief of the police had to interfere and warned the owner of the\r\nrestaurant that he would be marched to Siberia if he ever again let his\r\n‘grand duke’s room’ to the grand duke. ‘Imagine my perplexity,’ this\r\nman said to me on one occasion, when he was showing me that room, the\r\nwalls and ceiling of which were upholstered with thick satin cushions,\r\n‘On the one side I had to offend a member of the Imperial Family, who\r\ncould do with me what he liked, and on the other side General Trépoff\r\nmenaced me with Siberia! Of course I obeyed the General; he is, as\r\nyou know, omnipotent now.’ Another grand duke became conspicuous for\r\nways belonging to the domain of psychopathy; and a third was exiled to\r\nTurkestan, after he had stolen the diamonds of his mother.\r\n\r\nThe Empress Marie Alexándrovna, abandoned by her husband, and probably\r\nhorrified at the turn which Court life was taking, became more and\r\nmore a devotee, and soon she was entirely in the hands of the\r\npalace priests, a representative of a quite new type in the Russian\r\nChurch--the Jesuitic. This new genus of well-combed, depraved, and\r\nJesuitic clergy made rapid Progress at that time; already they were\r\nworking hard and with success to become a power in the State and to lay\r\nhands on the schools.\r\n\r\nIt has been proved over and over again that the village clergy in\r\nRussia are so much taken up by their functions--performing baptisms\r\nand marriages, administering Communion to the dying, and so on--that\r\nthey cannot pay due attention to the schools; even when the priest is\r\npaid for giving the Scripture lesson at a village school he usually\r\npasses that lesson to some one else, as he has no time to attend to\r\nit himself. Nevertheless the higher clergy, exploiting the hatred of\r\nAlexander II. toward the so-called revolutionary spirit, began their\r\ncampaign for laying their hands upon the schools. ‘No schools unless\r\nclerical ones’ became their motto. All Russia wanted education, but\r\neven the ridiculously small sum of two million roubles included every\r\nyear in the State budget for primary schools used _not_ to be spent\r\nby the Ministry of Public Instruction, while nearly as much was given\r\nto the Synod as an aid for establishing schools under the village\r\nclergy--schools most of which existed, and now exist, on paper only.\r\n\r\nAll Russia wanted technical education, but the Ministry opened\r\nonly classical gymnasia, because formidable courses of Latin and\r\nGreek were considered the best means of preventing the pupils from\r\nreading and thinking. In these gymnasia only two or three per cent.\r\nof the pupils succeeded in completing an eight years’ course, all\r\nboys promising to become something and to show some independence of\r\nthought being carefully sifted out before they could reach the last\r\nform, and all sorts of measures were taken to _reduce_ the numbers\r\nof pupils. Education was considered as a sort of luxury, for the\r\nfew only. At the same time the Ministry of Education was engaged\r\nin a continuous, passionate struggle against all private persons\r\nand institutions--district and county councils, municipalities,\r\nand the like--which endeavoured to open teachers’ seminaries or\r\ntechnical schools, or even simple primary schools. Technical\r\neducation--in a country which was so much in want of engineers,\r\neducated agriculturists, and geologists--was treated as equivalent to\r\nrevolutionism. It was prohibited, prosecuted; so that up to the present\r\ntime, every autumn, something like two or three thousand young men are\r\nrefused admission to the higher technical schools from mere lack of\r\nvacancies. A feeling of despair took possession of all those who wished\r\nto do anything useful in public life; while the peasantry were ruined\r\nat an appalling rate by over-taxation, and by ‘beating out’ of them the\r\narrears of the taxes by means of semi-military executions, which ruined\r\nthem for ever. Only those governors of the provinces were in favour at\r\nthe capital who managed to beat out the taxes in the most severe ways.\r\n\r\nSuch was the official St. Petersburg. Such was the influence it\r\nexercised upon Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nWhen we were leaving Siberia we often talked, my brother and I, of\r\nthe intellectual life which we should find at St. Petersburg, and of\r\nthe interesting acquaintances we should make in the literary circles.\r\nWe made such acquaintances, indeed, both among the radicals and among\r\nthe moderate Slavophiles; but I must confess that they were rather\r\ndisappointing. We found plenty of excellent men--Russia is full of\r\nexcellent men--but they did not quite correspond to our ideal of\r\npolitical writers. The best writers--Chernyshévsky, Mikháiloff,\r\nLavróff--were in exile, or were kept in the fortress of St. Peter and\r\nSt. Paul, like Písareff. Others, taking a gloomy view of the situation,\r\nhad changed their ideas, and were leaning toward a sort of paternal\r\nabsolutism; while the greater number, though holding still to their\r\nbeliefs, had become so cautious in expressing them that their prudence\r\nwas almost equal to desertion.\r\n\r\nAt the height of the reform period nearly everyone in the advanced\r\nliterary circles had had some relations either with Hérzen or with\r\nTurguéneff and his friends, or with the ‘Great Russian’ or the ‘Land\r\nand Freedom’ secret societies, which had at that period an ephemeral\r\nexistence. Now, these same men were only the more anxious to bury their\r\nformer sympathies as deep as possible, so as to appear above political\r\nsuspicion.\r\n\r\nOne or two of the liberal reviews which were tolerated at that time,\r\nowing chiefly to the superior diplomatic talents of their editors,\r\ncontained excellent material, showing the ever-growing misery and\r\nthe desperate conditions of the great mass of the peasants, and\r\nmaking clear enough the obstacles that were put in the way of every\r\nprogressive worker. The amount of such facts was enough to drive one\r\nto despair. But no one dared to suggest any remedy, or to hint at any\r\nfield of action, at any outcome from a position which was represented\r\nas hopeless. Some writers still cherished the hope that Alexander II.\r\nwould once more assume the character of reformer; but with the majority\r\nthe fear of seeing their reviews suppressed, and both editors and\r\ncontributors marched ‘to some more or less remote part of the empire,’\r\ndominated all other feelings. Fear and hope equally paralyzed them.\r\n\r\nThe more radical they had been ten years before, the greater were their\r\nfears. My brother and I were very well received in one or two literary\r\ncircles, and we went occasionally to their friendly gatherings; but\r\nthe moment the conversation began to lose its frivolous character,\r\nor my brother, who had a great talent for raising serious questions,\r\ndirected it toward home affairs, or toward the state of France,\r\nwhere Napoleon III. was hastening to his fall in 1870, some sort of\r\ninterruption was sure to occur. ‘What do you think, gentlemen, of the\r\nlatest performance of “La Belle Hélène”?’ or, ‘What is your opinion of\r\nthat cured fish?’ was loudly asked by one of the elder guests, and the\r\nconversation was brought to an end.\r\n\r\nOutside the literary circles things were even worse. In the sixties\r\nRussia, especially in St. Petersburg, was full of men of advanced\r\nopinions, who seemed ready at that time to make any sacrifices for\r\ntheir ideas. ‘What has become of them?’ I asked myself. I looked up\r\nsome of them; but, ‘Prudence, young man!’ was all they had to say.\r\n‘Iron is stronger than straw,’ or ‘One cannot break a stone wall with\r\nhis forehead,’ and similar proverbs, unfortunately too numerous in the\r\nRussian language, constituted now their code of practical philosophy.\r\n‘We have done something in our life: ask no more from us;’ or, ‘Have\r\npatience: this sort of thing will not last,’ they told us, while we,\r\nthe youth, were ready to resume the struggle, to act, to risk, to\r\nsacrifice everything, if necessary, and only asked them to give us\r\nadvice, some guidance and some intellectual support.\r\n\r\nTurguéneff has depicted in ‘Smoke’ some of the ex-reformers from\r\nthe upper layers of society, and his picture is disheartening. But\r\nit is especially in the heartrending novels and sketches of Madame\r\nKohanóvskaya, who wrote under the pseudonym of ‘V. Krestóvsky’\r\n(she must not be confounded with another novel-writer, Vsévolod\r\nKrestóvsky), that one can follow the many aspects which the degradation\r\nof the ‘liberals of the sixties’ took at that time. ‘The joy of\r\nliving’--perhaps the joy of having survived--became their goddess,\r\nas soon as the nameless crowd which ten years before made the\r\nforce of the reform movement refused to hear any more of ‘all that\r\nsentimentalism.’ They hastened to enjoy the riches which poured into\r\nthe hands of ‘practical’ men.\r\n\r\nMany new ways to fortune had been opened since serfdom had been\r\nabolished, and the crowd rushed with eagerness into these channels.\r\nRailways were feverishly made in Russia; to the lately opened private\r\nbanks the landlords went in numbers to mortgage their estates; the\r\nnewly established private notaries and lawyers at the courts were in\r\nthe possession of large incomes; the shareholders’ companies multiplied\r\nwith an appalling rapidity and the promoters flourished. A class of men\r\nwho formerly would have lived in the country on the modest income of a\r\nsmall estate cultivated by a hundred serfs, or on a still more modest\r\nsalary of a functionary in a law court, now made fortunes, or had such\r\nyearly incomes as in the times of serfdom were possible only for the\r\nland magnates.\r\n\r\nThe very taste of ‘society’ sank lower and lower. The Italian Opera,\r\nformerly a forum for radical demonstrations, was now deserted; the\r\nRussian Opera, timidly asserting the rights of its great composers, was\r\nfrequented by a few enthusiasts only. Both were found ‘tedious,’ and\r\nthe cream of St. Petersburg society crowded to a vulgar theatre where\r\nthe second-rate stars of the Paris small theatres won easy laurels from\r\ntheir _jeunesse dorée_ admirers, or went to see ‘La Belle Hélène,’\r\nwhich was played on the Russian stage, while our great dramatists were\r\nforgotten. Offenbach’s music reigned supreme.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt must be said that the political atmosphere was such that the best\r\nmen had reasons, or had at least weighty excuses, for keeping quiet.\r\nAfter Karakózoff had shot at Alexander II. in April 1866 the State\r\npolice had become omnipotent. Everyone suspected of ‘radicalism,’ no\r\nmatter what he had done or what he had not done, had to live under\r\nthe fear of being arrested any night for the sympathy he might have\r\nshown to some one involved in this or that political affair, or for\r\nan innocent letter intercepted in a midnight search, or simply for\r\nhis ‘dangerous’ opinions; and arrest for political reasons might mean\r\nanything--years of seclusion in the fortress of St. Peter and St. Paul,\r\ntransportation to Siberia, or even torture in the casemates of the\r\nfortress.\r\n\r\nThis movement of the circles of Karakózoff remains up to this date very\r\nimperfectly known, even in Russia. I was at that time in Siberia, and\r\nknow of it only by hearsay. It appears, however, that two different\r\ncurrents combined in it. One of them was the beginning of that great\r\nmovement ‘towards the people’ which later on took such a formidable\r\nextension, while the other current was mainly political. Groups of\r\nyoung men, some of whom were on the road to become brilliant university\r\nprofessors, or men of mark as historians and ethnographers, had come\r\ntogether about 1864, with the intention of carrying to the people\r\neducation and knowledge in spite of the opposition of the Government.\r\nThey went as mere artisans to great industrial towns, and started there\r\nco-operative associations, as well as informal schools, hoping that by\r\nthe exercise of much tact and patience they might be able to educate\r\nthe people, and thus to create the first centres from which better and\r\nhigher conceptions would gradually radiate amongst the masses. Their\r\nzeal was great; considerable fortunes were brought into the service of\r\nthe cause; and I am inclined to think that, compared with all similar\r\nmovements which took place later on, this one stood perhaps on the most\r\npractical basis. Its initiators certainly were very near to the working\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, with some of the members of these\r\ncircles--Karakózoff, Ishútin, and their nearest friends--the movement\r\ntook a political direction. During the years from 1862 to 1866 the\r\npolicy of Alexander II. had assumed a decidedly reactionary character;\r\nhe had surrounded himself with men of the most reactionary type, taking\r\nthem as his nearest advisers; the very reforms which made the glory\r\nof the beginning of his reign were now wrecked wholesale by means of\r\nby-laws and ministerial circulars: a return to manorial justice and\r\nserfdom in a disguised form was openly expected in the old camp; while\r\nno one could hope at that time that the main reform--the abolition of\r\nserfdom--could withstand the assaults directed against it from the\r\nWinter Palace itself. All this must have brought Karakózoff and his\r\nfriends to the idea that a further continuance of Alexander II.’s\r\nreign would be a menace even to the little that had been won; that\r\nRussia would have to return to the horrors of Nicholas I. if Alexander\r\ncontinued to rule. Great hopes were felt at the same time--this is ‘an\r\noften repeated story, but always new’--as to the liberal inclinations\r\nof the heir to the throne and his uncle Constantine. I must also\r\nsay that before 1866 such fears and such considerations were not\r\nunfrequently expressed in much higher circles than those with which\r\nKarakózoff seems to have been in contact. At any rate Karakózoff shot\r\nat Alexander II. one day, as he was coming out of the Summer Garden to\r\ntake his carriage. The shot missed, and Karakózoff was arrested on the\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nKatkóff, the leader of the Moscow reactionary party, and a great\r\nmaster in extracting pecuniary profits from every political\r\ndisturbance, at once accused all radicals and liberals of complicity\r\nwith Karakózoff--which was certainly false--and insinuated in his\r\npaper--making all Moscow believe it--that Karakózoff was a mere\r\ninstrument in the hands of the Grand Duke Constantine, the leader of\r\nthe reform party in the highest spheres. One can imagine how the two\r\nrulers, Shuváloff and Trépoff, exploited these accusations and the\r\nfears of Alexander II.\r\n\r\nMikhael Muravióff, who had won during the Polish insurrection his\r\nnickname of ‘the Hangman,’ received orders to make a most searching\r\ninquiry, and to discover by every possible means the plot which was\r\nsupposed to exist. He made arrests in all classes of society, ordered\r\nhundreds of searches, and boasted that he ‘would find the means to\r\nrender the prisoners more talkative.’ He certainly was not the man\r\nto recoil even before torture; and public opinion in St. Petersburg\r\nwas almost unanimous in saying that Karakózoff was tortured to obtain\r\navowals, but made none.\r\n\r\nState secrets are well kept in fortresses, especially in that huge\r\nmass of stone opposite the Winter Palace, which has seen so many\r\nhorrors, only in recent times disclosed by historians. It still keeps\r\nMuravióff’s secrets. However the following may perhaps throw some light\r\non this matter.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 I was in Siberia. One of our Siberian officers, who travelled\r\nfrom Russia to Irkútsk toward the end of that year, met at a post\r\nstation two gendarmes. They had accompanied to Siberia a functionary\r\nexiled for theft, and were now returning home. Our Irkútsk officer, who\r\nwas a very amiable man, finding the gendarmes at the tea table on a\r\ncold winter night, joined them and chatted with them while the horses\r\nwere being changed. One of the men knew Karakózoff.\r\n\r\n‘He was cunning, he was,’ he said. ‘When he was in the fortress we\r\nwere ordered, two of us--we were relieved every two hours--not to let\r\nhim sleep. So we kept him sitting on a small stool, and as soon as he\r\nbegan to doze we shook him to keep him awake.... What will you? we were\r\nordered to do so!... Well, see how cunning he was: he would sit with\r\ncrossed legs, swinging one of his legs to make us believe that he was\r\nawake, and himself, in the meantime, would get a nap, continuing to\r\nswing his leg. But we soon made it out and told those who relieved us,\r\nso that he was shaken and waked up every few minutes, whether he swung\r\nhis legs or not.’ ‘And how long did that last?’ my friend asked. ‘Oh,\r\nmany days--more than one week.’\r\n\r\nThe naïve character of this description is in itself a proof of\r\nveracity: it could not have been invented; and that Karakózoff was\r\ntortured to this degree may be taken for granted.\r\n\r\nWhen Karakózoff was hanged one of my comrades from the corps of pages\r\nwas present at the execution with his regiment of cuirassiers. ‘When\r\nhe was taken out of the fortress,’ my comrade told me, ‘sitting on\r\nthe high platform of the cart which was jolting on the rough glacis\r\nof the fortress, my first impression was that they were bringing out\r\nan india-rubber doll to be hanged, that Karakózoff was already dead.\r\nImagine that the head, the hands, the whole body were absolutely loose,\r\nas if there were no bones in the body, or as if the bones had all been\r\nbroken. It was a terrible thing to see, and to think what it meant.\r\nHowever, when two soldiers took him down from the cart I saw that he\r\nmoved his legs and made strenuous endeavours to walk by himself and to\r\nascend the steps of the scaffold. So it was not a doll, nor could he\r\nhave been in a swoon. All the officers were very much puzzled at the\r\ncircumstance and could not explain it.’ When, however, I suggested to\r\nmy comrade that perhaps Karakózoff had been tortured the colour came\r\ninto his face, and he replied, ‘So we all thought.’\r\n\r\nAbsence of sleep for weeks would alone be sufficient to explain the\r\nstate in which that morally very strong man was during the execution.\r\nI may add that I have the absolute certitude that--at least in one\r\ncase--drugs were administered to a prisoner in the fortress--namely,\r\n‘Sabúroff,’ in 1879. Did Muravióff limit the torture to this only? Was\r\nhe prevented from going any further, or not? I do not know. But this\r\nmuch I know: that I often heard from high officials at St. Petersburg\r\nthat torture had been resorted to in this case.\r\n\r\nMuravióff had promised to root out all radical elements in St.\r\nPetersburg, and all those who had had in any degree a radical past now\r\nlived under the fear of falling into the despot’s clutches. Above all\r\nthey kept aloof from the younger people, from fear of being involved\r\nwith them in some perilous political associations. In this way a chasm\r\nwas opened not only between the ‘fathers’ and the ‘sons,’ as Turguéneff\r\ndescribed it in his novel, not only between the two generations, but\r\nalso between all men who had passed the age of thirty and those who\r\nwere in their early twenties. Russian youth stood consequently in the\r\nposition not only of having to fight in their fathers the defenders\r\nof serfdom, but of being left entirely to themselves by their elder\r\nbrothers, who were unwilling to join them in their leanings toward\r\nsocialism, and were afraid to give them support even in their struggle\r\nfor more political freedom. Was there ever before in history, I ask\r\nmyself, a youthful band engaging in a fight against so formidable a\r\nfoe, so deserted by fathers and even by elder brothers, although those\r\nyoung men had merely taken to heart, and had tried to realize in life,\r\nthe intellectual inheritance of these same fathers and brothers? Was\r\nthere ever a struggle undertaken in more tragical conditions than these?\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nThe only bright point which I saw in the life of St. Petersburg was the\r\nmovement which was going on amongst the youth of both sexes. Various\r\ncurrents joined to produce the mighty agitation which soon took an\r\nunderground and revolutionary character, and engrossed the attention of\r\nRussia for the next fifteen years. I shall speak of it in a subsequent\r\nchapter; but I must mention in this place the movement which was\r\ncarried on, quite openly, by our women for obtaining access to higher\r\neducation. St. Petersburg was at that time its main centre.\r\n\r\nEvery afternoon the young wife of my brother, on her return from the\r\nwomen’s pedagogical courses which she followed, had something new to\r\ntell us about the animation which prevailed there. Schemes were laid\r\nfor opening a medical academy and universities for women; debates\r\nupon schools or upon different methods of education were organized in\r\nconnection with the courses, and hundreds of women took a passionate\r\ninterest in these questions, discussing them over and over again\r\nin private. Societies of translators, publishers, printers, and\r\nbookbinders were started, in order that work might be provided for the\r\npoorest members of the sisterhood who flocked to St. Petersburg, ready\r\nto do any sort of work, only to live in the hope that they, too, would\r\nsome day have their share of higher education. A vigorous, exuberant\r\nlife reigned in those feminine centres, in striking contrast to what I\r\nmet with elsewhere.\r\n\r\nSince the Government had shown its determined intention not to admit\r\nwomen to the existing universities they had directed all their efforts\r\ntoward opening universities of their own. They were told at the\r\nMinistry of Education that the girls who had passed through the girls’\r\ngymnasia (the high schools) were not prepared to follow university\r\nlectures. ‘Very well,’ they replied, ‘permit us to open intermediate\r\ncourses, preparatory to the university, and impose upon us any\r\nprogramme you like. We ask no grants from the State. Only give us the\r\npermission, and it will be done.’ Of course the permission was not\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nThen they started private courses and drawing-room lectures in all\r\nparts of St. Petersburg. Many university professors, in sympathy with\r\nthe new movement, volunteered to give lectures. Poor men themselves,\r\nthey warned the organizers that any mention of remuneration would be\r\ntaken as a personal offence. Natural science excursions used to be\r\nmade every summer in the neighbourhood of St. Petersburg, under the\r\nguidance of university professors, and women constituted the bulk\r\nof the excursionists. In the courses for midwives they forced the\r\nprofessors to treat each subject in a far more exhaustive way than was\r\nrequired by the programme, or to open additional courses. They took\r\nadvantage of every possibility, of every breach in the fortress, to\r\nstorm it. They gained admission to the anatomical laboratory of old\r\nDr. Gruber, and by their admirable work they won this enthusiast of\r\nanatomy entirely to their side. If they learned that a professor had\r\nno objection to letting them work in his laboratory on Sundays and at\r\nnight on week days, they took advantage of the opening, working late on\r\nweek days and all day on Sunday.\r\n\r\nAt last, notwithstanding all the opposition of the Ministry, they\r\nopened the intermediate courses, only giving them the name of\r\npedagogical courses. Was it possible, indeed, to forbid future mothers\r\nstudying the methods of education? But as the methods of teaching\r\nbotany or mathematics could not be taught in the abstract, botany,\r\nmathematics, and the rest were soon introduced into the curriculum of\r\nthe pedagogical courses, which became preparatory for the university.\r\n\r\nStep by step the women thus widened their rights. As soon as it became\r\nknown that at some German university a certain professor might open\r\nhis lecture-room to a few women, they knocked at his door and were\r\nadmitted. They studied law and history at Heidelberg, and mathematics\r\nat Berlin; at Zürich more than a hundred girls and women worked at\r\nthe University and the Polytechnicum. There they won something more\r\nvaluable than the degree of Doctor of Medicine; they won the esteem of\r\nthe most learned professors, who expressed it publicly several times.\r\nWhen I came to Zürich in 1872, and became acquainted with some of the\r\nstudents, I was astonished to see quite young girls, who were studying\r\nat the Polytechnicum, solving intricate problems of the theory of heat,\r\nwith the aid of the differential calculus, as easily as if they had had\r\nyears of mathematical training. One of the Russian girls who studied\r\nmathematics under Weierstrass at Berlin, Sophie Kovalévsky, became a\r\nmathematician of high repute, and was invited to a professorship at\r\nStockholm; she was, I believe, the first woman in our century to hold a\r\nprofessorship in a university for men. She was so young that in Sweden\r\nno one wanted to call her anything but by her diminutive name of Sónya.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the open hatred of Alexander II. for educated women--when\r\nhe met in his walks a girl wearing spectacles and a round Garibaldian\r\ncap he began to tremble, thinking that she must be a Nihilist bent on\r\nshooting him--in spite of the bitter opposition of the State police,\r\nwho represented every woman student as a revolutionist; in spite of the\r\nthunders and the vile accusations which Katkóff directed against the\r\nwhole of the movement in almost every number of his venomous gazette,\r\nthe women succeeded, in the teeth of the Government, in opening a\r\nseries of educational institutions. When several of them had obtained\r\nmedical degrees abroad they forced the Government, in 1872, to let\r\nthem open a medical academy with their own private means. And when the\r\nRussian women were recalled by their Government from Zürich, to prevent\r\ntheir intercourse with the revolutionist refugees, they forced the\r\nGovernment to let them open in Russia four universities of their own,\r\nwhich soon had nearly a thousand pupils. It seems almost incredible,\r\nbut it is a fact that notwithstanding all the prosecutions which the\r\nWomen’s Medical Academy had to live through, and its temporary closure,\r\nthere are now in Russia more than six hundred and seventy women\r\npractising as doctors.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was certainly a grand movement, astounding in its success and\r\ninstructive in a high degree. Above all it was through the unlimited\r\ndevotion of a mass of women in all possible capacities that they gained\r\ntheir successes. They had already worked as sisters of charity during\r\nthe Crimean war, as organizers of schools later on, as the most devoted\r\nschoolmistresses in the villages, as educated midwives and doctors’\r\nassistants amongst the peasants. They went afterward as nurses and\r\ndoctors in the fever-stricken hospitals during the Turkish war of 1878,\r\nand won the admiration of the military commanders and of Alexander II.\r\nhimself. I know two ladies, both very eagerly ‘wanted’ by the State\r\npolice, who served as nurses during the war, under assumed names which\r\nwere guaranteed by false passports; one of them, the greater ‘criminal’\r\nof the two, who had taken a prominent part in my escape, was even\r\nappointed head nurse of a large hospital for wounded soldiers, while\r\nher friend nearly died from typhoid fever. In short, women took any\r\nposition, no matter how low in the social scale, and no matter what\r\nprivations it involved, if only they could be in any way useful to\r\nthe people; not a few of them, but hundreds and thousands. They have\r\n_conquered_ their rights in the true sense of the word.\r\n\r\nAnother feature of this movement was that in it the chasm between the\r\ntwo generations--the older and the younger sisters--did not exist; or,\r\nat least, it was bridged over to a great extent. Those who were the\r\nleaders of the movement from its origin never broke the link which\r\nconnected them with their younger sisters, even though the latter were\r\nfar more advanced in their ideals than the older women were.\r\n\r\nThey pursued their aims in the higher spheres; they kept strictly aloof\r\nfrom any political agitation; but they never committed the fault of\r\nforgetting that their true force was in the masses of younger women,\r\nof whom a great number finally joined the radical or revolutionary\r\ncircles. These leaders were correctness itself--I considered them\r\ntoo correct--but they did not break with those younger students who\r\nwent about as typical Nihilists, with short-cropped hair, disdaining\r\ncrinoline, and betraying their democratic spirit in all their\r\nbehaviour. The leaders did not mix with them, and occasionally there\r\nwas friction, but they never repudiated them--a great thing, I believe,\r\nin those times of madly raging prosecutions.\r\n\r\nThey seemed to say to the younger and more democratic people, ‘We\r\nshall wear our velvet dresses and chignons, because we have to deal\r\nwith fools who see in a velvet dress and a chignon the tokens of\r\n“political reliability;” but you, girls, remain free in your tastes\r\nand inclinations.’ When the women who studied at Zürich were ordered\r\nby the Russian Government to return, these correct ladies did not turn\r\nagainst the rebels. They simply said to the Government, ‘You don’t like\r\nit? Well, then, open women’s universities at home; otherwise our girls\r\nwill go abroad in still greater numbers, and of course will enter into\r\nrelations with the political refugees.’ When they were reproached with\r\nbreeding revolutionists, and were menaced with the closing of their\r\nacademy and universities, they retorted, ‘Yes, many students become\r\nrevolutionists; but is that a reason for closing all universities?’ How\r\nfew political leaders have the moral courage not to turn against the\r\nmore advanced wing of their own party!\r\n\r\nThe real secret of their wise and fully successful attitude was\r\nthat none of the women who were the soul of that movement were mere\r\n‘feminists,’ desirous to get their share of the privileged positions in\r\nsociety and the State. Far from that. The sympathies of most of them\r\nwent with the masses. I remember the lively part which Miss Stásova,\r\nthe veteran leader of the agitation, took in the Sunday schools in\r\n1861, the friendships she and her friends made among the factory girls,\r\nthe interest they manifested in the hard life of those girls outside\r\nthe school, the fights they fought against their greedy employers. I\r\nrecall the keen interest which the women showed, at their pedagogical\r\ncourses, in the village schools and in the work of those few who, like\r\nBaron Korff, were permitted for some time to do something in that\r\ndirection, and the social spirit which permeated their courses. The\r\nrights they strove for--both the leaders and the great bulk of the\r\nwomen--were not only the individual right to higher instruction, but\r\nmuch more, far more, the right to be useful workers among the people,\r\nthe masses. This was why they succeeded to such an extent.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nFor the last few years the health of my father had been going from\r\nbad to worse, and when my brother Alexander and I came to see him, in\r\nthe spring of 1871, we were told by the doctors that with the first\r\nfrosts of autumn he would be gone. He had continued to live in the old\r\nstyle, in the Stáraya Konúshennaya, but around him everything in this\r\naristocratic quarter had changed. The rich serf-owners, who once were\r\nso prominent there, had gone. After having spent in a reckless way\r\nthe redemption money which they had received at the emancipation of\r\nthe serfs, and after having mortgaged and re-mortgaged their estates\r\nin the new land banks which preyed upon their helplessness, they had\r\nwithdrawn at last to the country or to provincial towns, there to sink\r\ninto oblivion. Their houses had been taken by ‘the intruders’--rich\r\nmerchants, railway contractors, and the like--while in nearly every\r\none of the old families which remained in the Old Equerries’ Quarters\r\na young life struggled to assert its rights upon the ruins of the\r\nold one. A couple of retired generals, who cursed the new ways, and\r\nrelieved their griefs by predicting for Russia a certain and speedy\r\nruin under the new order, or some relative occasionally dropping in,\r\nwere all the company my father had now. Out of our many relatives,\r\nnumbering nearly a score of families at Moscow alone in my childhood,\r\ntwo families only had remained in the capital, and these had joined the\r\ncurrent of the new life, the mothers discussing with their girls and\r\nboys such matters as schools for the people and women’s universities.\r\nMy father looked upon them with contempt. My stepmother and my younger\r\nstepsister, Pauline, who had not changed, did their best to comfort\r\nhim; but they themselves felt strange in their unwonted surroundings.\r\n\r\nMy father had always been unkind and most unjust toward my brother\r\nAlexander, but Alexander was utterly incapable of holding a grudge\r\nagainst anyone. When he entered our father’s sick-room, with the deep,\r\nkind look of his dark blue eyes and with a smile revealing his infinite\r\nkindness, and when he immediately found out what could be done to\r\nrender the sufferer more comfortable in his sick-chair, and did it\r\nas naturally as if he had left the sick-room only an hour before, my\r\nfather was simply bewildered; he stared at him without being able to\r\nunderstand. Our visit brought life into the dull, gloomy house; nursing\r\nbecame more bright; my stepmother, Pauline, the servants themselves,\r\ngrew more animated, and my father felt the change.\r\n\r\nOne thing worried him, however. He had expected to see us come as\r\nrepentant sons, imploring his support. But when he tried to direct\r\nconversation into that channel we stopped him with such a cheerful\r\n‘Don’t bother about that; we get on very nicely,’ that he was still\r\nmore bewildered. He looked for a scene in the old style--his sons\r\nbegging pardon, and money--perhaps he even regretted for a moment that\r\nthis did not happen; but he regarded us with a greater esteem. We were\r\nall three affected at parting. He seemed almost to dread returning\r\nto his gloomy loneliness amidst the wreckage of a system he had lived\r\nto maintain. But Alexander had to go back to his service, and I was\r\nleaving for Finland.\r\n\r\nWhen I was called home again, from Finland, I hurried to Moscow, to\r\nfind the burial ceremony just beginning, in that same old red church\r\nwhere my father had been baptized, and where the last prayers had\r\nbeen said over his mother. As the funeral procession passed along the\r\nstreets, of which every house was familiar to me in my childhood, I\r\nnoticed that the houses had changed little, but I knew that in all of\r\nthem a new life had begun.\r\n\r\nIn the house which had formerly belonged to our father’s mother and\r\nthen to Princess Mírski, and which now was bought by General N----,\r\nan old inhabitant of the Quarter, the only daughter of the family\r\nmaintained for a couple of years a painful struggle against her\r\ngood-natured but obstinate parents, who worshipped her but would not\r\nallow her to study at the university courses which had been opened for\r\nladies at Moscow. At last she was allowed to join these courses, but\r\nwas taken to them in an elegant carriage, under the close supervision\r\nof her mother, who courageously sat for hours on the benches\r\namongst the students, by the side of her beloved daughter; and yet,\r\nnotwithstanding all this care and watchfulness, a couple of years later\r\nthe daughter joined the revolutionary party, was arrested, and spent\r\none year in the fortress of St. Peter and St. Paul.\r\n\r\nIn the house opposite, the despotic heads of the family, Count and\r\nCountess Z----, were in a bitter struggle against their two daughters,\r\nwho were sick of the idle and useless existence their parents forced\r\nthem to lead, and who wanted to join those other girls who, free and\r\nhappy, flocked to the university courses. The struggle lasted for\r\nyears; the parents did not yield in this case, and the result of it\r\nwas that the elder girl ended her life by poisoning herself, when her\r\nyounger sister was allowed to follow her own inclinations.\r\n\r\nIn the house next door, which had been our family residence for a year,\r\nwhen I entered it with Tchaykóvsky to hold in it the first secret\r\nmeeting of a circle which we founded at Moscow, I at once recognized\r\nthe rooms which had been so familiar to me, in such a different\r\natmosphere, in my childhood. It now belonged to the family of Nathalie\r\nArmfeld, that highly sympathetic Kará ‘convict’ whom George Kennan has\r\nso touchingly described in his book on Siberia.\r\n\r\nAnd in a house within a stone’s throw of that where my father had died,\r\nand within a few months after his death, I received Stepniák, clothed\r\nas a peasant, he having escaped from a country village where he had\r\nbeen arrested for socialist propaganda amongst the peasants.\r\n\r\nSuch was the change which had been accomplished in the Old Equerries’\r\nQuarter within the last fifteen years. The last stronghold of the old\r\nnobility was now invaded by the new spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nThe next year, early in the spring, I made my first journey to\r\nWestern Europe. In crossing the Russian frontier I experienced, even\r\nmore intensely than I was prepared to do, what every Russian feels\r\non leaving his mother country. So long as the train runs on Russian\r\nground, through the thinly populated north-western provinces, one has\r\nthe feeling of crossing a desert. Hundreds of miles are covered with\r\nlow growths which hardly deserve the name of forests. Here and there\r\nthe eye discovers a small, miserably poor village buried in the snow,\r\nor an impracticable, muddy, narrow, and winding village road. But\r\neverything--scenery and surroundings--changes all of a sudden as soon\r\nas the train enters Prussia, with its clean-looking villages and farms,\r\nits gardens, and its paved roads; and the sense of contrast grows\r\nstronger and stronger as one penetrates further into Germany. Even dull\r\nBerlin seemed animated after our Russian towns.\r\n\r\nAnd the contrast of climate! Two days before I had left St. Petersburg\r\nthickly covered with snow, and now, in Middle Germany, I walked without\r\nan overcoat along the railway platform, in warm sunshine, admiring\r\nthe budding flowers. Then came the Rhine, and further on Switzerland,\r\nbathed in the rays of a bright sun, with its small, clean hotels, where\r\nbreakfast was served out of doors, in view of the snow-clad mountains.\r\nI never before had realized so vividly what Russia’s northern position\r\nmeant, and how the history of the Russian nation had been influenced\r\nby the fact that the main centres of its life had to develop in high\r\nlatitudes, as far north as the shores of the Gulf of Finland. Only then\r\nI fully understood the uncontrollable attraction which southern lands\r\nhave exercised on the Russians, the colossal efforts which they have\r\nmade to reach the Black Sea, and the steady pressure of the Siberian\r\ncolonists southward, further into Manchuria.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt that time Zürich was full of Russian students, both women and men.\r\nThe famous Oberstrass, near the Polytechnicum, was a corner of Russia,\r\nwhere the Russian language prevailed over all others. The students\r\nlived as most Russian students do, especially the women--that is,\r\nupon very little. Tea and bread, some milk, and a thin slice of meat\r\ncooked over a spirit lamp, amidst animated discussions about the latest\r\nnews of the socialistic world or the last book read, that was their\r\nregular fare. Those who had more money than was needed for such a mode\r\nof living gave it for the ‘common cause’--the library, the Russian\r\nreview which was going to be published, the support of the Swiss labour\r\npapers. As to their dress, the most parsimonious economy reigned in\r\nthat direction. Pushkin has written in a well-known verse, ‘What hat\r\nmay not suit a girl of sixteen?’ Our girls at Zürich seemed defiantly\r\nto throw this question at the population of the old Zwinglian city:\r\n‘Can there be a simplicity in dress which does not become a girl, when\r\nshe is young, intelligent, and full of energy?’\r\n\r\nWith all this the busy little community worked harder than any other\r\nstudents have ever worked since there were universities in existence,\r\nand the Zürich professors were never tired of showing the progress\r\naccomplished by the women at the university as an example to the male\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor many years I had longed to learn all about the International\r\nWorkingmen’s Association. Russian papers mentioned it pretty frequently\r\nin their columns, but they were not allowed to speak of its principles\r\nor what it was doing, I felt that it must be a great movement, full of\r\nconsequences, but I could not grasp its aims and tendencies. Now that I\r\nwas in Switzerland I determined to satisfy my longings.\r\n\r\nThe Association was then at the height of its development. Great hopes\r\nhad been awakened in the years 1840-48 in the hearts of European\r\nworkers. Only now we begin to realize what a formidable amount of\r\nsocialist literature was circulated in those years by socialists of all\r\ndenominations, Christian socialists, State socialists, Fourierists,\r\nSaint-Simonists, Owenites, and so on; and only now we begin to\r\nunderstand the depth of that movement, and to discover how much of what\r\nour generation has considered the product of contemporary thought was\r\nalready developed and said--often with great penetration--during those\r\nyears. The republicans understood then under the name of ‘republic’ a\r\nquite different thing from the democratic organization of capitalist\r\nrule which now goes under that name. When they spoke of the United\r\nStates of Europe they understood the brotherhood of workers, the\r\nweapons of war transformed into tools, and these tools used by all\r\nmembers of society for the benefit of all--‘the iron returned to the\r\nlabourer,’ as Pierre Dupont said in one of his songs. They meant not\r\nonly the reign of equality as regards criminal law and political\r\nrights, but particularly economic equality. The nationalists themselves\r\nsaw in their dreams Young Italy, Young Germany, and Young Hungary\r\ntaking the lead in far-reaching agrarian and economic reforms.\r\n\r\nThe defeat of the June insurrection at Paris, of Hungary by the armies\r\nof Nicholas I., and of Italy by the French and the Austrians, and the\r\nfearful reaction, political and intellectual, which followed everywhere\r\nin Europe, totally destroyed that movement. Its literature, its\r\nachievements, its very principles of economic revolution and universal\r\nbrotherhood were simply forgotten, lost, during the next twenty years.\r\n\r\nHowever, one idea had survived--the idea of an international\r\nbrotherhood of all the workers, which a few French emigrants continued\r\nto preach in the United States, and the followers of Robert Owen in\r\nEngland. The understanding which was reached by some English workers\r\nand a few French workers’ delegates to the London International\r\nExhibition of 1862 became then the starting point for a formidable\r\nmovement, which soon spread all over Europe, and included several\r\nmillion workers. The hopes which had been dormant for twenty years\r\nwere awakened once more, when the workers were called upon to unite,\r\n‘without distinction of creed, sex, nationality, race, or colour,’ to\r\nproclaim that ‘the emancipation of the workers must be their own work,’\r\nand to throw the weight of a strong, united, international organization\r\ninto the evolution of mankind--not in the name of love and charity,\r\nbut in the name of justice, of the force that belongs to a body of men\r\nmoved by a reasoned consciousness of their own aims and aspirations.\r\n\r\nTwo strikes at Paris, in 1868 and 1869, more or less helped by small\r\ncontributions sent from abroad, especially from England, insignificant\r\nthough they were in themselves, and the prosecutions which the Imperial\r\nGovernment directed against the International, became the origin of\r\nan immense movement, in which the solidarity of the workers of all\r\nnations was proclaimed in the face of the rivalries of the States.\r\nThe idea of an international union of all trades, and of a struggle\r\nagainst capital with the aid of international support, carried away the\r\nmost indifferent of the workers. The movement spread like wildfire in\r\nFrance, Belgium, Italy, and Spain, bringing to the front a great number\r\nof intelligent, active, and devoted workers, and attracting to it some\r\ndecidedly superior men and women from the wealthier educated classes.\r\nA force, never before suspected to exist, grew stronger every day in\r\nEurope; and if the movement had not been arrested in its growth by the\r\nFranco-German war, great things would probably have happened in Europe,\r\ndeeply modifying the aspects of our civilization, and undoubtedly\r\naccelerating human progress. Unfortunately, the crushing victory of the\r\nGermans brought about abnormal conditions in Europe; it stopped for a\r\nquarter of a century the normal development of France, and threw all\r\nEurope into a period of militarism, which we are still living in at the\r\npresent moment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll sorts of partial solutions of the great social question had\r\ncurrency at that time among the workers--co-operation, productive\r\nassociations supported by the State, people’s banks, gratuitous credit,\r\nand so on. Each of these solutions was brought before the ‘sections’\r\nof the Association, and then before the local, regional, national,\r\nand international congresses, and eagerly discussed. Every annual\r\ncongress of the Association marked a new step in advance, in the\r\ndevelopment of ideas about the great social problem which stands before\r\nour generation and calls for a solution. The amount of intelligent\r\nthings which were said at these congresses, and of scientifically\r\ncorrect, deeply thought over ideas which were circulated--all being\r\nthe results of the _collective_ thought of the workers--has never yet\r\nbeen sufficiently appreciated; but there is no exaggeration in saying\r\nthat all schemes of social reconstruction which are now in vogue\r\nunder the name of ‘scientific socialism’ or ‘anarchism’ had their\r\norigin in the discussions and reports of the different congresses of\r\nthe International Association. The few educated men who joined the\r\nmovement have only put into a theoretical shape the criticisms and the\r\naspirations which were expressed in the sections, and subsequently in\r\nthe congresses, by the workers themselves.\r\n\r\nThe war of 1870-71 had hampered the development of the Association,\r\nbut had not stopped it. In all the industrial centres of Switzerland\r\nnumerous and animated sections of the International existed, and\r\nthousands of workers flocked to their meetings, at which war was\r\ndeclared upon the existing system of private ownership of land and\r\nfactories, and the near end of the capitalist system was proclaimed.\r\nLocal congresses were held in various parts of the country, and at each\r\nof these gatherings most arduous and difficult problems of the present\r\nsocial organization were discussed, with a knowledge of the matter and\r\na depth of conception which alarmed the middle classes even more than\r\ndid the numbers of adherents who joined the sections, or groups, of\r\nthe International. The jealousies and prejudices which had hitherto\r\nexisted in Switzerland between the privileged trades (the watchmakers\r\nand jewellers) and the rougher trades (weavers, building trades, and\r\nso on), and which had prevented joint action in labour disputes, were\r\ndisappearing. The workers asserted with increasing emphasis that of all\r\nthe divisions which exist in modern society by far the most important\r\nis that between the owners of capital and those who not only come into\r\nthe world penniless, but are doomed to remain producers of wealth for\r\nthe favoured few.\r\n\r\nItaly, especially middle and northern Italy, was honeycombed with\r\ngroups and sections of the International; and in these the Italian\r\nunity so long struggled for was declared a mere illusion. The workers\r\nwere called upon to make their own revolution--to take the land for the\r\npeasants and the factories for the workers themselves, and to abolish\r\nthe oppressive centralized organization of the State, whose historical\r\nmission always was to protect and to maintain the exploitation of man\r\nby man.\r\n\r\nIn Spain similar organizations covered Catalonia, Valencia, and\r\nAndalusia; they were supported by, and united with, the powerful\r\nlabour unions of Barcelona, which already then had introduced the\r\neight hours’ day in the building trades. The International had no less\r\nthan eighty thousand regularly paying Spanish members; it embodied\r\nall the active and thinking elements of the population; and by its\r\ndistinct refusal to meddle with the political intrigues during 1871-72\r\nit had drawn to itself in an immense degree the sympathies of the\r\nmasses. The proceedings of its provincial and national congresses, and\r\nthe manifestoes which they issued, were models of a severe logical\r\ncriticism of the existing conditions, as well as admirably lucid\r\nstatements of the workers’ ideals.\r\n\r\nIn Belgium, Holland, and even in Portugal the same movement was\r\nspreading, and it had already brought into the Association the great\r\nmass and the best elements of the Belgian coal miners and weavers. In\r\nEngland the trades unions had also joined the movement, at least in\r\nprinciple, and, without committing themselves to Socialism, were ready\r\nto support their Continental brethren in direct struggles against\r\ncapital, especially in strikes. In Germany the socialists had concluded\r\na union with the rather numerous followers of Lassalle, and the first\r\nfoundations of a social democratic party had been laid. Austria and\r\nHungary followed in the same track; and although no international\r\norganization was possible at that time in France, after the defeat\r\nof the Commune and the reaction which followed (Draconic laws having\r\nbeen enacted against the adherents of the Association), everyone was\r\npersuaded, nevertheless, that this period of reaction would not last,\r\nand that France would soon join the Association again and take the lead\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to Zürich I joined one of the local sections of the\r\nInternational Workingmen’s Association. I also asked my Russian friends\r\nwhere I could learn more about the great movement which was going on\r\nin other countries. ‘Read,’ was their reply, and my sister-in-law, who\r\nwas then studying at Zürich, brought me large numbers of books and\r\ncollections of newspapers for the last two years. I spent days and\r\nnights in reading, and received a deep impression which nothing will\r\nefface; the flood of new thoughts awakened is associated in my mind\r\nwith a tiny clean room in the Oberstrass, commanding from a window\r\na view of the blue lake, with the mountains beyond it, where the\r\nSwiss fought for their independence, and the high spires of the old\r\ntown--that scene of so many religious struggles.\r\n\r\nSocialistic literature has never been rich in books. It is written\r\nfor workers, for whom one penny is money, and its main force lies in\r\nits small pamphlets and its newspapers. Moreover he who seeks for\r\ninformation about socialism finds in books little of what he requires\r\nmost. They contain the theories or the scientific arguments in favour\r\nof socialist aspirations, but they give no idea how the workers accept\r\nsocialist ideals, and how they could put them into practice. There\r\nremains nothing but to take collections of papers and read them all\r\nthrough--the news as well as the leading articles--the former, perhaps,\r\neven more than the latter. Quite a new world of social relations and\r\nmethods of thought and action is revealed by this reading, which gives\r\nan insight into what cannot be found anywhere else--namely, the depth\r\nand the moral force of the movement, the degree to which men are\r\nimbued with the new theories, their readiness to carry them out in\r\ntheir daily life and to suffer for them. All discussions about the\r\nimpracticability of socialism and the necessary slowness of evolution\r\nare of little value, because the speed of evolution can only be judged\r\nfrom a close knowledge of the human beings of whose evolution we are\r\nspeaking. What estimate of a sum can be made without knowing its\r\ncomponents?\r\n\r\nThe more I read the more I saw that there was before me a new\r\nworld, unknown to me, and totally unknown to the learned makers of\r\nsociological theories--a world that I could know only by living in the\r\nWorkingmen’s Association and by meeting the workers in their everyday\r\nlife. I decided, accordingly, to spend a couple of months in such a\r\nlife. My Russian friends encouraged me, and after a few days’ stay\r\nat Zürich I left for Geneva, which was then a great centre of the\r\ninternational movement.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe place where the Geneva sections used to meet was the spacious\r\nMasonic Temple Unique. More than two thousand men could come together\r\nin its large hall at the general meetings, while every evening all\r\nsorts of committee and section meetings took place in the side-rooms,\r\nor classes in history, physics, engineering, and so on, were held.\r\nFree instruction was given there to the workers by the few, very few,\r\nmiddle-class men who had joined the movement, mainly French refugees of\r\nthe Paris Commune. It was a people’s university as well as a people’s\r\nforum.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief leaders of the movement at the Temple Unique was a\r\nRussian, Nicholas Ootin, a bright, clever, and active man; and the\r\nreal soul of it was a most sympathetic Russian lady, who was known\r\nfar and wide amongst the workers as Madame Olga. She was the working\r\nforce in all the committees. Both Ootin and Madame Olga received me\r\ncordially, made me acquainted with all the men of mark in the sections\r\nof the different trades, and invited me to be present at the committee\r\nmeetings. So I went, but I preferred being with the workers themselves.\r\nTaking a glass of sour wine at one of the tables in the hall, I used to\r\nsit there every evening amid the workers, and soon became friendly with\r\nseveral of them, especially with a stonemason from Alsace, who had left\r\nFrance after the insurrection of the Commune. He had children, just\r\nabout the age of the two whom my brother had so suddenly lost a few\r\nmonths before, and through the children I was soon on good terms with\r\nthe family and their friends. I could thus follow the movement from the\r\ninside, and know the workers’ view of it.\r\n\r\nThe workers had built all their hopes on the international movement.\r\nYoung and old flocked to the Temple Unique after their long day’s work,\r\nto get hold of the scraps of instruction which they could obtain there,\r\nor to listen to the speakers who promised them a grand future, based\r\nupon the common possession of all that man requires for the production\r\nof wealth, and upon a brotherhood of men, without distinction of\r\ncaste, race, or nationality. All hoped that a great social revolution,\r\npeaceful or not, would soon come and totally change the economic\r\nconditions. No one desired class war, but all said that if the ruling\r\nclasses rendered it unavoidable, through their blind obstinacy, the war\r\nmust be fought over, provided it would bring with it well-being and\r\nliberty to the down-trodden masses.\r\n\r\nOne must have lived among the workers at that time to realize the\r\neffect which the sudden growth of the Association had upon their\r\nminds--the trust they put in it, the love with which they spoke of it,\r\nthe sacrifices they made for it. Every day, week after week and year\r\nafter year, thousands of workers gave their time and their coppers,\r\ntaken upon their very food, in order to support the life of each\r\ngroup, to secure the appearance of the papers, to defray the expenses\r\nof the congresses, to support the comrades who had suffered for the\r\nAssociation. Another thing that impressed me deeply was the elevating\r\ninfluence which the International exercised. Most of the Paris\r\nInternationalists were almost total abstainers from drink, and all had\r\nabandoned smoking. ‘Why should I nurture in myself that weakness?’ they\r\nsaid. The mean, the trivial disappeared to leave room for the grand,\r\nthe elevating inspirations.\r\n\r\nOutsiders never realize the sacrifices which are made by the workers in\r\norder to keep their labour movements alive. No small amount of moral\r\ncourage was required to join openly a section of the International\r\nAssociation, and to face the discontent of the master and a probable\r\ndismissal at the first opportunity, with the long months out of work\r\nwhich usually followed. But, even under the best circumstances,\r\nbelonging to a trade union, or to any advanced party, requires a series\r\nof uninterrupted sacrifices. Even a few pence given for the common\r\ncause represent a burden on the meagre budget of the European worker,\r\nand many pence have to be disbursed every week. Frequent attendance\r\nat the meetings means a sacrifice too. For us it may be a pleasure to\r\nspend a couple of hours at a meeting, but for men whose working day\r\nbegins at five or six in the morning those hours have to be stolen from\r\nnecessary rest.\r\n\r\nI felt this devotion as a standing reproach. I saw how eager the\r\nworkers were to gain instruction, and how despairingly few were those\r\nwho volunteered to aid them. I saw how much the toiling masses needed\r\nto be helped by men possessed of education and leisure in their\r\nendeavours to spread and to develop the organization; but few and rare\r\nwere those who came to assist without the intention of making political\r\ncapital out of this very helplessness of the people! More and more I\r\nbegan to feel that I was bound to cast in my lot with them. Stepniák\r\nsays, in his ‘Career of a Nihilist,’ that every revolutionist has had\r\na moment in his life when some circumstance, maybe unimportant in\r\nitself, has brought him to pronounce his oath of giving himself to the\r\ncause of revolution. I know that moment; I lived through it after one\r\nof the meetings at the Temple Unique, when I felt more acutely than\r\never before how cowardly are the educated men who hesitate to put their\r\neducation, their knowledge, their energy at the service of those who\r\nare so much in need of that education and that energy. ‘Here are men,’\r\nI said to myself, ‘who are conscious of their servitude, who work to\r\nget rid of it; but where are the helpers? Where are those who will come\r\nto serve the masses--not to utilize them for their own ambitions?’\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGradually some doubts began, however, to creep into my mind as to the\r\nsoundness of the agitation which was carried on at the Temple Unique.\r\nOne night a well-known Geneva lawyer, Monsieur A., came to the meeting,\r\nand stated that if he had not hitherto joined the Association it was\r\nbecause he had first to settle his own business affairs; having now\r\nsucceeded in that direction, he came to join the labour movement.\r\nI felt shocked at this cynical avowal, and when I communicated my\r\nreflections to my stone-mason friend he explained to me that this\r\ngentleman, having been defeated at the previous election, when he\r\nsought the support of the radical party, now hoped to be elected by the\r\nsupport of the labour vote. ‘We accept their services for the present,’\r\nmy friend concluded, ‘but when the revolution comes our first move will\r\nbe to throw all of them overboard.’\r\n\r\nThen came a great meeting, hastily convoked, to protest, as it was\r\nsaid, against the calumnies of the ‘Journal de Genève.’ This organ of\r\nthe moneyed classes of Geneva had ventured to suggest that mischief was\r\nbrewing at the Temple Unique, and that the building trades were going\r\nonce more to make a general strike, such as they had made in 1869. The\r\nleaders at the Temple Unique called the meeting. Thousands of workers\r\nfilled the hall, and Ootin asked them to pass a resolution, the wording\r\nof which seemed to me very strange: an indignant protest was expressed\r\nin it against the inoffensive suggestion that the workers were going\r\nto strike. ‘Why should this suggestion be described as a calumny?’ I\r\nasked myself. ‘Is it, then, a crime to strike?’ Ootin concluded in the\r\nmeantime a hurried speech in support of his resolution with the words,\r\n‘If you agree, citizens, with it I will send it at once to the press.’\r\nHe was going to leave the platform, when somebody in the hall suggested\r\nthat discussion would not be out of place; and then the representatives\r\nof all branches of the building trades stood up in succession, saying\r\nthat the wages had lately been so low that they could hardly live upon\r\nthem; that with the opening of the spring there was plenty of work in\r\nview, of which they intended to take advantage to increase their wages;\r\nand that if an increase were refused they intended to begin a general\r\nstrike.\r\n\r\nI was furious, and next day hotly reproached Ootin for his behaviour.\r\n‘As a leader,’ I told him, ‘you were bound to know that a strike had\r\nreally been spoken of.’ In my innocence I did not suspect the real\r\nmotives of the leaders, and it was Ootin himself who made me understand\r\nthat a strike at that time would be disastrous for the election of the\r\nlawyer, Monsieur A.\r\n\r\nI could not reconcile this wire-pulling by the leaders with the\r\nburning speeches I had heard them pronounce from the platform. I\r\nfelt disheartened, and spoke to Ootin of my intention to make myself\r\nacquainted with the other section of the International Association at\r\nGeneva, which was known as the Bakunísts. The name ‘anarchist’ was\r\nnot much in use then. Ootin gave me at once a word of introduction to\r\nanother Russian, Nicholas Joukóvsky, who belonged to that section, and,\r\nlooking straight into my face, he added with a sigh, ‘Well, you won’t\r\nreturn to us; you will remain with them.’ He had guessed right.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nI went first to Neuchâtel, and then spent a week or so among the\r\nwatchmakers in the Jura Mountains. I thus made my first acquaintance\r\nwith that famous Jura Federation which played for the next few years an\r\nimportant part in the development of socialism, introducing into it the\r\nno-government, or anarchist, tendency.\r\n\r\nIn 1872, the Jura Federation was becoming a rebel against the authority\r\nof the general council of the International Workingmen’s Association.\r\nThe Association was essentially a working-men’s organization, the\r\nworkers understanding it as a labour movement and not as a political\r\nparty. In East Belgium, for instance, they had introduced into the\r\nstatutes a clause in virtue of which no one could be a member of a\r\nsection unless employed in a manual trade; even foremen were excluded.\r\n\r\nThe workers were moreover federalist in principle. Each nation, each\r\nseparate region, and even each local section had to be left free\r\nto develop on its own lines. But the middle-class revolutionists\r\nof the old school who had entered the International, imbued as\r\nthey were with the notions of the centralized, pyramidal secret\r\norganizations of earlier times, had introduced the same notions\r\ninto the Workingmen’s Association. Beside the federal and national\r\ncouncils, a general council was nominated at London, to act as a\r\nsort of intermediary between the councils of the different nations.\r\nMarx and Engels were its leading spirits. It soon appeared, however,\r\nthat the mere fact of having such a central body became a source of\r\nsubstantial inconvenience. The general council was not satisfied with\r\nplaying the part of a correspondence bureau; it strove to govern the\r\nmovement, to approve or to censure the action of the local federations\r\nand sections, and even of individual members. When the Commune\r\ninsurrection began in Paris--and ‘the leaders had only to follow,’\r\nwithout being able to say whereto they would be led within the next\r\ntwenty-four hours--the general council insisted upon directing\r\nthe insurrection from London. It required daily reports about the\r\nevents, gave orders, favoured this and hampered that, and thus put in\r\nevidence the disadvantage of having a governing body, even within the\r\nAssociation. The disadvantage became still more apparent when, at a\r\nsecret conference held in 1871, the general council, supported by a\r\nfew delegates, decided to direct the forces of the Association towards\r\nelectoral agitation. It set people thinking about the evils of any\r\ngovernment, however democratic its origin. This was the first spark of\r\nanarchism. The Jura Federation became the centre of opposition against\r\nthe general council.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe separation between leaders and workers which I had noticed at\r\nGeneva in the Temple Unique did not exist in the Jura Mountains.\r\nThere were a number of men who were more intelligent, and especially\r\nmore active, than the others; but that was all. James Guillaume, one\r\nof the most intelligent and broadly educated men I ever met, was a\r\nproof-reader and the manager of a small printing office. His earnings\r\nin this capacity were so small that he had to give his nights to\r\ntranslating novels from German into French, for which he was paid eight\r\nfrancs for sixteen pages.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to Neuchâtel, he told me that unfortunately he could not\r\nspare even as much as a couple of hours for a friendly chat. The\r\nprinting office was just issuing that afternoon the first number of a\r\nlocal paper, and in addition to his usual duties of proof-reader and\r\nco-editor, he had to write on the wrappers a thousand addresses of\r\npersons to whom the first three numbers would be sent, and to fasten\r\nhimself the wrappers.\r\n\r\nI offered to aid him in writing the addresses, but that was not\r\npracticable, because they were either kept in memory or written on\r\nscraps of paper in an unreadable hand.... ‘Well, then,’ said I, ‘I will\r\ncome in the afternoon to the office and fasten the wrappers, and you\r\nwill give me the time which you may thus save.’\r\n\r\nWe understood each other. Guillaume warmly shook my hand, and that\r\nwas the beginning of our friendship. We spent all the afternoon in\r\nthe office, he writing the addresses, I fastening the wrappers, and a\r\nFrench Communard, who was a compositor, chatting with us all the while\r\nas he rapidly composed a novel, intermingling his conversation with the\r\nsentences which he had to put in type and which he read aloud.\r\n\r\n‘The fight in the streets,’ he would say, ‘became very sharp.’... ‘Dear\r\nMary, I love you.’... ‘The workers were furious and fought like lions\r\nat Montmartre,’ ... ‘and he fell on his knees before her,’ ... ‘and\r\nthat lasted for four days. We knew that Galliffet was shooting all\r\nprisoners--the more terrible still was the fight,’ and so on he went,\r\nrapidly lifting the type from the case.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the evening that Guillaume took off his working blouse,\r\nand we went out for a friendly chat for a couple of hours, when he had\r\nto resume his work as editor of the ‘Bulletin’ of the Jura Federation.\r\n\r\nAt Neuchâtel I also made the acquaintance of Malon. He was born in a\r\nvillage, and in his childhood he was a shepherd. Later on he came to\r\nParis, learned there a trade--basket-making--and, like the book-binder\r\nVarlin and the carpenter Pindy, with whom he was associated in the\r\nInternational, had come to be widely known as one of the leading\r\nspirits of the Association when it was prosecuted in 1869 by Napoleon\r\nIII. All three had entirely won the hearts of the Paris workers, and\r\nwhen the Commune insurrection broke out they were elected members of\r\nthe Council of the Commune, all three receiving formidable numbers of\r\nvotes. Malon was also mayor of one of the Paris _arrondissements_.\r\nNow, in Switzerland, he was earning his living as a basket-maker. He\r\nhad rented for a few coppers a month a small open shed out of the\r\ntown, on the slope of a hill, from which he enjoyed while at work an\r\nextensive view of the Lake of Neuchâtel. At night he wrote letters, a\r\nbook on the Commune, short articles for the labour papers--and thus\r\nhe became a writer. Every day I went to see him and to hear what this\r\nbroad-faced, laborious, slightly poetical, quiet, and most good-hearted\r\nCommunard had to tell me about the insurrection in which he took a\r\nprominent part, and which he had just described in a book, ‘The Third\r\nDefeat of the French Proletariate.’\r\n\r\nOne morning when I had climbed the hill and reached his shed, he met\r\nme quite radiant with the words: ‘You know, Pindy is alive! Here is a\r\nletter from him; he is in Switzerland.’ Nothing had been heard of Pindy\r\nsince he was seen last on May 25 or May 26 at the Tuileries, and he\r\nwas supposed to be dead, while in reality he remained in concealment\r\nat Paris. And while Malon’s fingers continued to ply the wickers and\r\nto shape them into an elegant basket, he told me in his quiet voice,\r\nwhich only slightly trembled at times, how many men had been shot by\r\nthe Versailles troops on the supposition that they were Pindy, Varlin,\r\nhimself, or some other leader. He told me what he knew of the death\r\nof Varlin, the book-binder whom the Paris workers worshipped, or old\r\nDelécluze, who did not want to survive the defeat, and many others; and\r\nhe related the horrors which he had witnessed during that carnival of\r\nblood with which the wealthy classes of Paris celebrated their return\r\nto the capital, and then--the spirit of retaliation which took hold\r\nof a crowd, led by Raoul Rigault, which executed the hostages of the\r\nCommune.\r\n\r\nHis lips quivered when he spoke of the heroism of the children; and\r\nhe quite broke down when he told me the story of that boy whom the\r\nVersailles troops were going to shoot, and who asked the officer’s\r\npermission to hand first a silver watch, which he had on, to his\r\nmother, who lived close by. The officer, yielding to a moment of pity,\r\nlet the boy go, probably hoping that he would never return. But a\r\nquarter of an hour later the boy was back and, taking his place amidst\r\nthe corpses at the wall, said: ‘I am ready.’ Twelve bullets put an end\r\nto his young life.\r\n\r\nI think I never suffered so much as when I read that terrible book, ‘Le\r\nLivre Rouge de la Justice Rurale,’ which contained nothing but extracts\r\nfrom the letters of the _Standard_, _Daily Telegraph_, and _Times_\r\ncorrespondents, written from Paris during the last days of May 1871,\r\nrelating the horrors committed by the Versailles army under Galliffet,\r\ntogether with a few quotations from the Paris _Figaro_, imbued with a\r\nbloodthirsty spirit towards the insurgents. In reading these pages I\r\nwas filled with despair concerning mankind, and should have continued\r\nto despair, had I not afterwards seen in those of the defeated party\r\nwho had lived through all these horrors, that absence of hatred, that\r\nconfidence in the final triumph of their ideas, that calm though sad\r\ngaze of their eyes directed towards the future, that readiness to\r\nforget the nightmare of the past, which struck me in Malon; in fact, in\r\nnearly all the refugees of the Commune whom I met at Geneva, and which\r\nI still see in Louise Michel, Lefrançais, Elisée Reclus, and other\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nFrom Neuchâtel I went to Sonvilliers. In a little valley in the Jura\r\nhills there is a succession of small towns and villages of which\r\nthe French-speaking population was at that time entirely employed\r\nin the various branches of watchmaking; whole families used to work\r\nin small workshops. In one of them I found another leader, Adhémar\r\nSchwitzguébel, with whom, also, I afterward became very closely\r\nconnected. He sat among a dozen young men who were engraving lids of\r\ngold and silver watches. I was asked to take a seat on a bench or\r\ntable, and soon we were all engaged in a lively conversation upon\r\nsocialism, government or no government, and the coming congresses.\r\n\r\nIn the evening a heavy snowstorm raged; it blinded us, and froze\r\nthe blood in our veins, as we struggled to the next village. But,\r\nnotwithstanding the storm, about fifty watchmakers, chiefly old people,\r\ncame from the neighbouring towns and villages--some of them as far\r\nas seven miles distant--to join in a small informal meeting that was\r\ncalled for that evening.\r\n\r\nThe very organization of the watch trade, which permits men to know\r\none another thoroughly and to work in their own houses, where they\r\nare free to talk, explains why the level of intellectual development\r\nin this population is higher than that of workers who spend all their\r\nlife from early childhood in the factories. There is more independence\r\nand more originality among petty trades’ workers. But the absence of\r\na division between the leaders and the masses in the Jura Federation\r\nwas also the reason why there was not a question upon which every\r\nmember of the federation would not strive to form his own independent\r\nopinion. Here I saw that the workers were not a mass that was being led\r\nand made subservient to the political ends of a few men; their leaders\r\nwere simply their more active comrades--initiators rather than leaders.\r\nThe clearness of insight, the soundness of judgment, the capacity for\r\ndisentangling complex social questions, which I noticed amongst these\r\nworkers, especially the middle-aged ones, deeply impressed me; and I\r\nam firmly persuaded that if the Jura Federation has played a prominent\r\npart in the development of socialism, it is not only on account of the\r\nimportance of the no-government and federalist ideas of which it was\r\nthe champion, but also on account of the expression which was given to\r\nthese ideas by the good sense of the Jura watchmakers. Without their\r\naid, these conceptions might have remained mere abstractions for a long\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe theoretical aspects of anarchism, as they were then beginning to be\r\nexpressed in the Jura Federation, especially by Bakúnin; the criticisms\r\nof state socialism--the fear of an economic despotism, far more\r\ndangerous than the merely political despotism--which I heard formulated\r\nthere; and the revolutionary character of the agitation, appealed\r\nstrongly to my mind. But the equalitarian relations which I found in\r\nthe Jura Mountains, the independence of thought and expression which\r\nI saw developing in the workers, and their unlimited devotion to the\r\ncause appealed even more strongly to my feelings; and when I came away\r\nfrom the mountains, after a week’s stay with the watchmakers, my views\r\nupon socialism were settled. I was an anarchist.\r\n\r\nA subsequent journey to Belgium, where I could compare once more the\r\ncentralized political agitation at Brussels with the economic and\r\nindependent agitation that was going on amongst the clothiers at\r\nVerviers, only strengthened my views. These clothiers were one of the\r\nmost sympathetic populations that I have ever met with in Western\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nBakúnin was at that time at Locarno. I did not see him, and now regret\r\nit very much, because he was dead when I returned four years later to\r\nSwitzerland. It was he who had helped the Jura friends to clear up\r\ntheir ideas and to formulate their aspirations; he who had inspired\r\nthem with his powerful, burning, irresistible revolutionary enthusiasm.\r\nAs soon as he saw that a small newspaper, which Guillaume began to edit\r\nin the Jura hills (at Locle), was sounding a new note of independent\r\nthought in the socialist movement, he came to Locle, talked for whole\r\ndays and whole nights long to his new friends about the historical\r\nnecessity of a new move in the anarchist direction; he wrote for that\r\npaper a series of profound and brilliant articles on the historical\r\nprogress of mankind towards freedom; he infused enthusiasm into his new\r\nfriends, and he created that centre of propaganda from which anarchism\r\nspread later on to other parts of Europe.\r\n\r\nAfter he had moved to Locarno--from whence he started a similar\r\nmovement in Italy and, through his sympathetic and gifted emissary,\r\nFanelli, also in Spain--the work that he had begun in the Jura hills\r\nwas continued independently by the Jurassians themselves. The name\r\nof ‘Michel’ often recurred in their conversations--not, however, as\r\nthat of an absent chief whose opinions would make law, but as that of\r\na personal friend of whom everyone spoke with love, in a spirit of\r\ncomradeship. What struck me most was that Bakúnin’s influence was felt\r\nmuch less as the influence of an intellectual authority than as the\r\ninfluence of a moral personality. In conversations about anarchism,\r\nor about the attitude of the federation, I never heard it said,\r\n‘Bakúnin has said so’ or ‘Bakúnin thinks so,’ as if it clenched the\r\ndiscussion. His writings and his sayings were not a text that one had\r\nto obey--as is often unfortunately the case in political parties. In\r\nall such matters, in which intellect is the supreme judge, everyone in\r\ndiscussion used his own arguments. Their general drift and tenor might\r\nhave been suggested by Bakúnin, or Bakúnin might have borrowed them\r\nfrom his Jura friends--at any rate, in each individual the arguments\r\nretained their own individual character. I only once heard Bakúnin’s\r\nname invoked as an authority in itself, and that struck me so much that\r\nI even now remember the spot where the conversation took place and its\r\nsurroundings. The young men began once in the presence of women some\r\nyoung men’s talk, not very respectful towards the other sex, when one\r\nof the women present put a sudden stop to it by exclaiming: ‘Pity that\r\nMichel is not here: he would have put you in your place!’ The colossal\r\nfigure of the revolutionist who had given up everything for the sake of\r\nthe revolution, and lived for it alone, borrowing from his conception\r\nof it the highest and purest conceptions of life, continued to inspire\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI returned from this journey with distinct sociological conceptions\r\nwhich I have retained since, doing my best to develop them in more and\r\nmore definite, concrete forms.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, one point which I did not accept without having\r\ngiven to it a great deal of thinking and many hours of my nights. I\r\nclearly saw that the immense change which would hand over everything\r\nthat is necessary for life and production into the hands of society--be\r\nit the Folk State of the social democrats, or the free unions of freely\r\nassociated groups, as the anarchists say--would imply a revolution far\r\nmore profound than any of those which history has on record. Moreover,\r\nin such a revolution the workers would have against them, not the\r\nrotten generation of aristocrats against whom the French peasants\r\nand republicans had to fight in the last century--and even that\r\nfight was a desperate one--but the far more powerful, intellectually\r\nand physically, middle classes, which have at their service all the\r\npotent machinery of the modern State. However, I soon noticed that\r\nno revolution, whether peaceful or violent, has ever taken place\r\nwithout the new ideals having deeply penetrated into the very class\r\nitself whose economical and political privileges had to be assailed.\r\nI had witnessed the abolition of serfdom in Russia, and I knew that\r\nif a conviction of the injustice of their rights had not widely\r\nspread within the serf-owners’ class itself (as a consequence of the\r\nprevious evolution and revolutions accomplished in Western Europe),\r\nthe emancipation of the serfs would never have been accomplished as\r\neasily as it was in 1861. And I saw that the idea of emancipation of\r\nthe workers from the present wage-system was making headway amongst\r\nthe middle classes themselves. The most ardent defenders of the present\r\neconomical conditions had already abandoned the plea of _right_ in\r\ndefending the present privileges--questions as to the _opportuneness_\r\nof such a change having already taken its place. They did not deny\r\nthe desirability of some such change, and only asked whether the new\r\neconomical organization advocated by the socialists would really be\r\nbetter than the present one; whether a society in which the workers\r\nwould have a dominant voice would be able to manage production better\r\nthan the individual capitalists, actuated by mere considerations of\r\nself-interest, manage it at the present time.\r\n\r\nBesides, I began gradually to understand that revolutions, _i.e._\r\nperiods of accelerated rapid evolution and rapid changes, are as much\r\nin the nature of human society as the slow evolution which incessantly\r\ngoes on now among the civilized races of mankind. And each time that\r\nsuch a period of accelerated evolution and thorough reconstruction\r\nbegins, civil war may break out on a small or on a grand scale. The\r\nquestion is, then, not so much how to avoid revolutions as how to\r\nattain the greatest results with the most limited amount of civil war,\r\nthe least number of victims, and a minimum of mutual embitterment.\r\nFor that end there is only one means; namely, that the oppressed part\r\nof society should obtain the clearest possible conception of what\r\nthey intend to achieve and how, and that they should be imbued with\r\nthe enthusiasm which is necessary for that achievement--in which case\r\nthey will be sure to attract to their cause the best and the freshest\r\nintellectual forces of the class which is possessed of historically\r\ngrown-up privileges.\r\n\r\nThe Commune of Paris was a terrible example of an outbreak with yet\r\nundetermined ideals. When the workers became, in March 1871, the\r\nmasters of the great city, they did not attack the property rights\r\nvested in the middle classes. On the contrary, they took these rights\r\nunder their protection. The leaders of the Commune covered the National\r\nBank with their bodies, and notwithstanding the crisis which had\r\nparalysed industry, and the consequent absence of earning for a mass\r\nof workers, they protected the rights of the owners of the factories,\r\nthe trade establishments, and the dwelling-houses at Paris with their\r\ndecrees. However, when the movement was crushed, no account was taken\r\nby the middle classes of the modesty of the Communalist claims of the\r\ninsurgents. Having lived for two months in fear that the workers would\r\nmake an assault upon their property rights, the rich men of France took\r\nupon the workers just the same revenge as if they had made the assault\r\nin reality. Nearly thirty thousand workers were slaughtered, as is\r\nknown, not in battle but after they had lost the battle. If the workers\r\nhad taken steps towards the socialization of property, the revenge\r\ncould not have been more terrible.\r\n\r\nIf, then, my conclusion was that there are periods in human development\r\nwhen a conflict is unavoidable, and civil war breaks out quite\r\nindependently of the will of particular individuals, let, at least,\r\nthese conflicts take place, not on the ground of vague aspirations, but\r\nupon definite issues; not upon secondary points, the insignificance\r\nof which does not diminish the violence of the conflict, but upon\r\nbroad ideas which inspire men by the grandness of the horizon which\r\nthey bring into view. In this last case the conflict itself will\r\ndepend much less upon the efficacy of firearms and guns than upon the\r\nforce of the creative genius which will be brought into action in the\r\nwork of reconstruction of society. It will depend chiefly upon the\r\nconstructive forces of society taking for the moment a free course;\r\nupon the inspirations being of a higher standard, and so winning more\r\nsympathy even from those who, as a class, are opposed to the change.\r\nThe conflict, being thus engaged in on larger issues, will purify the\r\nsocial atmosphere itself; and the numbers of victims on both sides will\r\ncertainly be much smaller than they would have been in case the fight\r\nhad been fought upon matters of secondary importance in which the lower\r\ninstincts of men find a free play.\r\n\r\nWith these ideas I returned to Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nDuring my journey I had bought a number of books and collections of\r\nsocialist newspapers. In Russia such books were ‘unconditionally\r\nprohibited’ by censorship; and some of the collections of newspapers\r\nand reports of international congresses could not be bought for any\r\namount of money even in Belgium. ‘Shall I part with them, while\r\nmy brother and my friends would be so glad to have them at St.\r\nPetersburg?’ I asked myself; and I decided that by all means I must get\r\nthem into Russia.\r\n\r\nI returned to St. Petersburg _viâ_ Vienna and Warsaw. Thousands of\r\nJews live by smuggling on the Polish frontier, and I thought that if I\r\ncould succeed in discovering only one of them my books would be carried\r\nin safety across the border. However, to alight at a small railway\r\nstation near the frontier while every other passenger went on, and to\r\nhunt there for smugglers, would hardly have been reasonable; so I took\r\na side branch of the railway and went to Cracow. ‘The capital of Old\r\nPoland is near to the frontier,’ I thought, ‘and I shall find there\r\nsome Jew who will lead me to the men I seek.’\r\n\r\nI reached the once renowned and brilliant city in the evening,\r\nand early next morning went out from my hotel on my search. To my\r\nbewilderment I saw, however, at every street corner and wherever I\r\nturned my eyes in the otherwise deserted market place a Jew, wearing\r\nthe traditional long dress and locks of his forefathers, and watching\r\nthere for some Polish nobleman or tradesman who might send him on an\r\nerrand and pay him a few coppers for the service. I wanted to find\r\n_one_ Jew; and now there were too many of them. Whom should I approach?\r\nI made the round of the town, and then, in my despair, I decided\r\nto accost the Jew who stood at the entrance gate of my hotel--an\r\nimmense old palace, of which in former days every hall was filled with\r\nelegant crowds of gaily dressed dancers, but which now fulfilled the\r\nmore prosaic function of giving food and shelter to a few occasional\r\ntravellers. I explained to the man my desire of smuggling into Russia a\r\nrather heavy bundle of books and newspapers.\r\n\r\n‘Very easily done, sir,’ he replied. ‘I will just bring to you the\r\nrepresentative of the Universal Company for the International Exchange\r\nof (let me say) Rags and Bones. They carry on the largest smuggling\r\nbusiness in the world, and he is sure to oblige you.’ Half an hour\r\nlater he really returned with the representative of the company--a most\r\nelegant young man, who spoke in perfection Russian, German, and Polish.\r\n\r\nHe looked at my bundle, weighed it with his hands, and asked what sort\r\nof books were in it.\r\n\r\n‘All severely prohibited by Russian censorship; that is why they must\r\nbe smuggled in.’\r\n\r\n‘Books,’ he said, ‘are not exactly in our line of trade; our business\r\nlies in costly silks. If I were going to pay my men by weight,\r\naccording to our silk tariff, I should have to ask you a quite\r\nextravagant price. And then, to tell the truth, I don’t much like\r\nmeddling with books. The slightest mishap, and “they” would make of it\r\na political affair, and then it would cost the Universal Rags and Bones\r\nCompany a tremendous sum of money to get clear of it.’\r\n\r\nI probably looked very sad, for the elegant young man who represented\r\nthe Universal Rags and Bones Company immediately added: ‘Don’t be\r\ntroubled. He [the hotel commissionnaire] will arrange it for you in\r\nsome other way.’\r\n\r\n‘Oh yes. There are scores of ways to arrange such a trifle, to oblige\r\nthe gentleman,’ jovially remarked the commissionnaire, as he left me.\r\n\r\nIn an hour’s time he came back with another young man. This one took\r\nthe bundle, put it by the side of the door, and said: ‘It’s all right.\r\nIf you leave to-morrow, you shall have your books at such a station in\r\nRussia,’ and he explained to me how it would be managed.\r\n\r\n‘How much will it cost?’ I asked.\r\n\r\n‘How much are you disposed to pay?’ was the reply.\r\n\r\nI emptied my purse on the table, and said: ‘That much for my journey.\r\nThe remainder is yours, I will travel third class!’\r\n\r\n‘Wai! wai! wai!’ exclaimed both men at once, ‘What are you saying, sir?\r\nSuch a gentleman travel third class! Never! No, no, no, that won’t\r\ndo.... Eight roubles will do for us, and then one rouble or so for the\r\ncommissionnaire, if you are agreeable to it--just as much as you like.\r\nWe are not highway robbers, but honest tradesmen.’ And they bluntly\r\nrefused to take more money.\r\n\r\nI had often heard of the honesty of the Jewish smugglers on the\r\nfrontier; but I had never expected to have such a proof of it. Later\r\non, when our circle imported many books from abroad, or still later,\r\nwhen so many revolutionists and refugees crossed the frontier in\r\nentering or leaving Russia, there was not a case in which the smugglers\r\nbetrayed anyone, or took advantage of the circumstances to exact an\r\nexorbitant price for their services.\r\n\r\nNext day I left Cracow; and at the designated Russian station a porter\r\napproached my compartment, and, speaking loudly, so as to be heard by\r\nthe gendarme who was walking along the platform, said to me, ‘Here is\r\nthe bag your highness left the other day,’ and handed me my precious\r\nparcel.\r\n\r\nI was so pleased to have it that I did not even stop at Warsaw, but\r\ncontinued my journey directly to St. Petersburg, to show my trophies to\r\nmy brother.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nA formidable movement was developing in the meantime amongst the\r\neducated youth of Russia. Serfdom was abolished. But quite a network\r\nof habits and customs of domestic slavery, of utter disregard of\r\nhuman individuality, of despotism on the part of the fathers, and\r\nof hypocritical submission on that of the wives, the sons, and the\r\ndaughters, had developed during the two hundred and fifty years that\r\nserfdom had existed. Everywhere in Europe, at the beginning of this\r\ncentury, there was a great deal of domestic despotism--the writings of\r\nThackeray and Dickens bear ample testimony to it--but nowhere else had\r\nthat tyranny attained such a luxurious development as in Russia. All\r\nRussian life, in the family, in the relations between commander and\r\nsubordinate, military chief and soldier, employer and employee, bore\r\nthe stamp of it. Quite a world of customs and manners of thinking, of\r\nprejudices and moral cowardice, of habits bred by a lazy existence, had\r\ngrown up; and even the best men of the time paid a large tribute to\r\nthese products of the serfdom period.\r\n\r\nLaw could have no grip upon these things. Only a vigorous social\r\nmovement, which would attack the very roots of the evil, could\r\nreform the habits and customs of everyday life; and in Russia this\r\nmovement--this revolt of the individual--took a far more powerful\r\ncharacter, and became far more sweeping in its criticisms, than\r\nanywhere in Western Europe or America. ‘Nihilism’ was the name that\r\nTurguéneff gave it in his epoch-making novel, ‘Fathers and Sons.’\r\n\r\nThe movement is often misunderstood in western Europe. In the press,\r\nfor example, Nihilism is confused with terrorism. The revolutionary\r\ndisturbance which broke out in Russia toward the close of the reign\r\nof Alexander II., and ended in the tragical death of the Tsar, is\r\nconstantly described as Nihilism. This is, however, a mistake.\r\nTo confuse Nihilism with terrorism is as wrong as to confuse a\r\nphilosophical movement like Stoicism or Positivism with a political\r\nmovement, such as, for example, republicanism. Terrorism was called\r\ninto existence by certain special conditions of the political struggle\r\nat a given historical moment. It has lived, and has died. It may revive\r\nand die out again. But Nihilism has impressed its stamp upon the whole\r\nof the life of the educated classes of Russia, and that stamp will be\r\nretained for many years to come. It is Nihilism, divested of some of\r\nits rougher aspects--which were unavoidable in a young movement of that\r\nsort--which gives now to the life of a great portion of the educated\r\nclasses of Russia a certain peculiar character which we Russians regret\r\nnot to find in the life of Western Europe. It is Nihilism, again, in\r\nits various manifestations which gives to many of our writers that\r\nremarkable sincerity, that habit of ‘thinking aloud,’ which astounds\r\nwestern European readers.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the Nihilist declared war upon what may be described as\r\nthe ‘conventional lies of civilized mankind.’ Absolute sincerity was\r\nhis distinctive feature, and in the name of that sincerity he gave up,\r\nand asked others to give up, those superstitions, prejudices, habits,\r\nand customs which their own reason could not justify. He refused to\r\nbend before any authority except that of reason, and in the analysis of\r\nevery social institution or habit he revolted against any sort of more\r\nor less masked sophism.\r\n\r\nHe broke, of course, with the superstitions of his fathers, and\r\nin his philosophical conceptions he was a positivist, an agnostic,\r\na Spencerian evolutionist, or a scientific materialist; and while\r\nhe never attacked the simple, sincere religious belief which is a\r\npsychological necessity of feeling, he bitterly fought against the\r\nhypocrisy that leads people to assume the outward mask of a religion\r\nwhich they continually throw aside as useless ballast.\r\n\r\nThe life of civilized people is full of little conventional lies.\r\nPersons who dislike each other, meeting in the street, make their faces\r\nradiant with a happy smile; the Nihilist remained unmoved, and smiled\r\nonly for those whom he was really glad to meet. All those forms of\r\noutward politeness which are mere hypocrisy were equally repugnant to\r\nhim, and he assumed a certain external roughness as a protest against\r\nthe smooth amiability of his fathers. He saw them wildly talking\r\nas idealist sentimentalists, and at the same time acting as real\r\nbarbarians toward their wives, their children, and their serfs; and he\r\nrose in revolt against that sort of sentimentalism, which, after all,\r\nso nicely accommodated itself to the anything but ideal conditions of\r\nRussian life. Art was involved in the same sweeping negation. Continual\r\ntalk about beauty, the ideal, art for art’s sake, æsthetics, and the\r\nlike, so willingly indulged in--while every object of art was bought\r\nwith money exacted from starving peasants or from underpaid workers,\r\nand the so-called ‘worship of the beautiful’ was but a mask to cover\r\nthe most commonplace dissoluteness--inspired him with disgust; and the\r\ncriticisms of art which one of the greatest artists of the century,\r\nTolstóy, has now powerfully formulated, the Nihilist expressed in the\r\nsweeping assertion, ‘A pair of boots is more important than all your\r\nMadonnas and all your refined talk about Shakespeare.’\r\n\r\nMarriage without love and familiarity without friendship were\r\nrepudiated. The Nihilist girl, compelled by her parents to be a doll in\r\na doll’s house, and to marry for property’s sake, preferred to abandon\r\nher house and her silk dresses; she put on a black woollen dress of the\r\nplainest description, cut off her hair, and went to a high school, in\r\norder to win there her personal independence. The woman who saw that\r\nher marriage was no longer a marriage--that neither love nor friendship\r\nconnected any more those who were legally considered husband and\r\nwife--preferred to break a bond which retained none of its essential\r\nfeatures; and she often went with her children to face poverty,\r\npreferring loneliness and misery to a life which, under conventional\r\nconditions, would have given a perpetual lie to her best self.\r\n\r\nThe Nihilist carried his love of sincerity even into the minutest\r\ndetails of everyday life. He discarded the conventional forms of\r\nsociety talk, and expressed his opinions in a blunt and terse way, even\r\nwith a certain affectation of outward roughness.\r\n\r\nWe used in Irkútsk to meet once a week in a club, and to have some\r\ndancing, I was for a time a regular visitor at these _soirées_, but\r\ngradually, having to work, I abandoned them. One night, as I had not\r\nmade my appearance for several weeks in succession, a young friend of\r\nmine was asked by one of the ladies why I did not come any more to\r\ntheir gatherings. ‘He takes a ride now when he wants exercise,’ was the\r\nrather rough reply of my friend. ‘But he might come to spend a couple\r\nof hours with us, without dancing,’ one of the ladies ventured to say.\r\n‘What would he do here?’ retorted my Nihilist friend, ‘talk with you\r\nabout fashions and furbelows? He has had enough of that nonsense.’\r\n‘But he sees occasionally Miss So-and-So,’ timidly remarked one of\r\nthe young ladies present. ‘Yes, but she is a studious girl,’ bluntly\r\nreplied my friend, ‘he helps her with her German.’ I must add that\r\nthis undoubtedly rough rebuke had the effect that most of the Irkútsk\r\ngirls began next to besiege my brother, my friend, and myself with\r\nquestions as to what we should advise them to read or to study. With\r\nthe same frankness the Nihilist spoke to his acquaintances, telling\r\nthem that all their talk about ‘this poor people’ was sheer hypocrisy\r\nso long as they lived upon the underpaid work of these people whom they\r\ncommiserated at their ease as they chatted together in richly decorated\r\nrooms; and with the same frankness a Nihilist would inform a high\r\nfunctionary that he (the said functionary) cared not a straw for the\r\nwelfare of those whom he ruled, but was simply a thief!\r\n\r\nWith a certain austerity the Nihilist would rebuke the woman who\r\nindulged in small talk, and prided herself on her ‘womanly’ manners\r\nand elaborate toilette. He would bluntly say to a pretty young person:\r\n‘How is it that you are not ashamed to talk this nonsense and to wear\r\nthat chignon of false hair?’ In a woman he wanted to find a comrade,\r\na human personality--not a doll or a ‘muslin girl’--and he absolutely\r\nrefused to join in those petty tokens of politeness with which men\r\nsurround those whom they like so much to consider as ‘the weaker sex.’\r\nWhen a lady entered a room a Nihilist did not jump off his seat to\r\noffer it to her--unless he saw that she looked tired and there was no\r\nother seat in the room. He behaved towards her as he would have behaved\r\ntowards a comrade of his own sex; but if a lady--who might have been a\r\ntotal stranger to him---manifested the desire to learn something which\r\nhe knew and she knew not, he would walk every night to the far end of\r\na great city to help her with his lessons. The young man who would\r\nnot move his hand to serve a lady with a cup of tea, would transfer\r\nto the girl who came to study at Moscow or St. Petersburg the only\r\nlesson which he had got and which gave him daily bread, simply saying\r\nto her: ‘It is easier for a man to find work than it is for a woman.\r\nThere is no attempt at knighthood in my offer, it is simply a matter of\r\nequality.’\r\n\r\nTwo great Russian novelists, Turguéneff and Goncharóff, have tried to\r\nrepresent this new type in their novels. Goncharóff, in _Precipice_,\r\ntaking a real but unrepresentative individual of this class, made a\r\ncaricature of Nihilism. Turguéneff was too good an artist, and had\r\nhimself conceived too much admiration for the new type, to let himself\r\nbe drawn into caricature painting; but even his Nihilist, Bazároff, did\r\nnot satisfy us. We found him too harsh, especially in his relations\r\nwith his old parents, and, above all, we reproached him with his\r\nseeming neglect of his duties as a citizen. Russian youth could not\r\nbe satisfied with the merely negative attitude of Turguéneff’s hero.\r\nNihilism, with its affirmation of the rights of the individual and its\r\nnegation of all hypocrisy, was but a first step toward a higher type\r\nof men and women, who are equally free, but live for a great cause. In\r\nthe Nihilists of Chernyshévsky, as they are depicted in his far less\r\nartistic novel, ‘What is to be Done?’ they saw better portraits of\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n‘It is bitter, the bread that has been made by slaves,’ our poet\r\nNekrásoff wrote. The young generation actually refused to eat that\r\nbread, and to enjoy the riches that had been accumulated in their\r\nfathers’ houses by means of servile labour, whether the labourers were\r\nactual serfs or slaves of the present industrial system.\r\n\r\nAll Russia read with astonishment, in the indictment which was produced\r\nat the court against Karakózoff and his friends, that these young men,\r\nowners of considerable fortunes, used to live three or four in the\r\nsame room, never spending more than ten roubles (one pound) apiece a\r\nmonth for all their needs, and giving at the same time their fortunes\r\nfor co-operative associations, co-operative workshops (where they\r\nthemselves worked), and the like. Five years later, thousands and\r\nthousands of the Russian youth--the best part of it--were doing the\r\nsame. Their watchword was, ‘V naród!’ (To the people; be the people.)\r\nDuring the years 1860-65 in nearly every wealthy family a bitter\r\nstruggle was going on between the fathers, who wanted to maintain the\r\nold traditions, and the sons and daughters, who defended their right to\r\ndispose of their life according to their own ideals. Young men left the\r\nmilitary service, the counter, the shop, and flocked to the university\r\ntowns. Girls, bred in the most aristocratic families, rushed penniless\r\nto St. Petersburg, Moscow, and Kíeff, eager to learn a profession which\r\nwould free them from the domestic yoke, and some day, perhaps, also\r\nfrom the possible yoke of a husband. After hard and bitter struggles,\r\nmany of them won that personal freedom. Now they wanted to utilize it,\r\nnot for their own personal enjoyment, but for carrying to the people\r\nthe knowledge that had emancipated them.\r\n\r\nIn every town of Russia, in every quarter of St. Petersburg, small\r\ngroups were formed for self-improvement and self-education; the works\r\nof the philosophers, the writings of the economists, the researches\r\nof the young Russian historical school, were carefully read in these\r\ncircles, and the reading was followed by endless discussions. The aim\r\nof all that reading and discussion was to solve the great question\r\nwhich rose before them: In what way could they be useful to the masses?\r\nGradually, they came to the idea that the only way was to settle\r\namongst the people and to live the people’s life. Young men went\r\ninto the villages as doctors, doctors’ assistants, teachers, village\r\nscribes, even as agricultural labourers, blacksmiths, woodcutters, and\r\nso on, and tried to live there in close contact with the peasants.\r\nGirls passed teachers’ examinations, learned midwifery or nursing, and\r\nwent by the hundred into the villages, devoting themselves entirely to\r\nthe poorest part of the population.\r\n\r\nThey went without even having any ideals of social reconstruction or\r\nany thought of revolution; merely and simply they wanted to teach the\r\nmass of the peasants to read, to instruct them, to give them medical\r\nhelp, or in any way to aid to raise them from their darkness and\r\nmisery, and to learn at the same time from them what were _their_\r\npopular ideals of a better social life.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned from Switzerland I found this movement in full swing.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nI hastened, of course, to share with my friends my impressions of the\r\nInternational Workingmen’s Association and my books. At the university\r\nI had no friends, properly speaking; I was older than most of my\r\ncompanions, and among young people a difference of a few years is\r\nalways an obstacle to complete comradeship. It must also be said that\r\nsince the new rules of admission to the university had been introduced\r\nin 1861, the best of the young men, the most developed and the most\r\nindependent in thought, were sifted out of the gymnasia, and did not\r\ngain admittance to the university. Consequently, the majority of my\r\ncomrades were good boys, laborious, but taking no interest in anything\r\nbesides the examinations.\r\n\r\nI was friendly with only one of them: let me call him Dmítri Kelnitz.\r\nHe was born in South Russia, and, although his name was German, he\r\nhardly spoke German, and his face was South Russian rather than\r\nTeutonic. He was very intelligent, had read a great deal, and had\r\nseriously thought over what he had read. He loved science and deeply\r\nrespected it, but, like many of us, he soon came to the conclusion that\r\nto follow the career of a scientific man meant to join the camp of the\r\nPhilistines, and that there was plenty of other and more urgent work\r\nthat he could do. He attended the university lectures for two years,\r\nand then abandoned them, giving himself entirely to social work. He\r\nlived anyhow; I even doubt if he had a permanent lodging. Sometimes he\r\nwould come to me and ask, ‘Have you some paper?’ and, having taken\r\na supply of it, he would sit at the corner of a table for an hour or\r\ntwo, diligently making a translation. The little that he earned in this\r\nway was more than sufficient to satisfy all his limited wants. Then he\r\nwould hurry to a distant part of the town to see a comrade or to help\r\na needy friend; or he would cross St. Petersburg on foot, to a remote\r\nsuburb, in order to obtain free admission to a college for some boy in\r\nwhom the comrades were interested. He was undoubtedly a gifted man.\r\nIn Western Europe a man far less gifted would have worked his way to\r\na position of political or socialist leadership. No such thought ever\r\nentered the brain of Kelnitz. To lead men was by no means his ambition,\r\nand there was no work too insignificant for him to do. This trait,\r\nhowever, was not distinctive of him alone; all those who had lived some\r\nyears in the students’ circles of those times were possessed of it to a\r\nhigh degree.\r\n\r\nSoon after my return Kelnitz invited me to join a circle which was\r\nknown among the youth as ‘the Circle of Tchaykóvsky.’ Under this name\r\nit played an important part in the history of the social movement in\r\nRussia, and under this name it will go down to history. ‘Its members,’\r\nKelnitz said to me, ‘have hitherto been mostly constitutionalists; but\r\nthey are excellent men, with minds open to any honest idea; they have\r\nplenty of friends all over Russia, and you will see later on what you\r\ncan do.’ I already knew Tchaykóvsky and a few other members of this\r\ncircle. Tchaykóvsky had won my heart at our first meeting, and our\r\nfriendship has remained unshaken for twenty-seven years.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of this circle was a very small group of young men and\r\nwomen--one of whom was Sophie Peróvskaya--who had united for purposes\r\nof self-education and self-improvement. Tchaykóvsky was of their\r\nnumber. In 1869 Necháieff had tried to start, amidst the youth imbued\r\nwith the above-mentioned desire of working amongst the people, a secret\r\nrevolutionary organization, and to secure this end he resorted to the\r\nways of old conspirators, without recoiling even before deceit when\r\nhe wanted to force his associates to follow his lead. Such methods\r\ncould have no success in Russia, and very soon his society broke down.\r\nAll the members were arrested, and some of the best and purest of\r\nthe Russian youth went to Siberia before they had done anything. The\r\ncircle of self-education of which I am speaking was constituted in\r\nopposition to the methods of Necháieff. The few friends had judged,\r\nquite correctly, that a morally developed individuality must be the\r\nfoundation of every organization, whatever political character it\r\nmay take afterward and whatever programme of action it may adopt in\r\nthe course of future events. This was why the circle of Tchaykóvsky,\r\ngradually widening its programme, spread so extensively in Russia,\r\nachieved such important results, and later on, when the ferocious\r\nprosecutions of the government created a revolutionary struggle,\r\nproduced that remarkable set of men and women who fell in the terrible\r\ncontest they waged against autocracy.\r\n\r\nAt that time, however--that is, in 1872--the circle had nothing\r\nrevolutionary in it. If it had remained a mere circle of\r\nself-improvement, it would soon have petrified like a monastery.\r\nBut the members found a suitable work. They began to spread good\r\nbooks. They bought the works of Lassalle, Bervi (on the condition of\r\nthe labouring classes in Russia), Marx, Russian historical works,\r\nand so on--whole editions--and distributed them among students in\r\nthe provinces. In a few years there was not a town of importance\r\nin ‘thirty-eight provinces of the Russian Empire,’ to use official\r\nlanguage, where this circle did not have a group of comrades engaged\r\nin the spreading of that sort of literature. Gradually, following the\r\ngeneral drift of the times, and stimulated by the news which came from\r\nWestern Europe about the rapid growth of the labour movement, the\r\ncircle became more and more a centre of socialistic propaganda among\r\nthe educated youth, and a natural intermediary between numbers of\r\nprovincial circles; and then, one day, the ice between students and\r\nworkers was broken, and direct relations were established with working\r\npeople at St. Petersburg and in some of the provinces. It was at that\r\njuncture that I joined the circle, in the spring of 1872.\r\n\r\nAll secret societies are fiercely prosecuted in Russia, and the western\r\nreader will perhaps expect from me a description of my initiation and\r\nof the oath of allegiance which I took. I must disappoint him, because\r\nthere was nothing of the sort, and could not be; we should have been\r\nthe first to laugh at such ceremonies, and Kelnitz would not have\r\nmissed the opportunity of putting in one of his sarcastic remarks,\r\nwhich would have killed any ritual. There was not even a statute. The\r\ncircle accepted as members only persons who were well known and had\r\nbeen tested in various circumstances, and of whom it was felt that they\r\ncould be trusted absolutely. Before a new member was received, his\r\ncharacter was discussed with the frankness and seriousness which were\r\ncharacteristic of the Nihilist. The slightest token of insincerity or\r\nconceit would have barred the way to admission. The circle did not care\r\neither to make a show of numbers, and had no tendency to concentrate\r\nin its hands all the activity that was going on among the youth, or\r\nto include in one organization the scores of different circles which\r\nexisted in the capitals and the provinces. With most of them friendly\r\nrelations were maintained; they were helped, and they helped us, when\r\nnecessity arose, but no assault was made on their autonomy.\r\n\r\nThe circle preferred to remain a closely united group of friends; and\r\nnever did I meet elsewhere such a collection of morally superior men\r\nand women as the score of persons whose acquaintance I made at the\r\nfirst meeting of the circle of Tchaykóvsky. I still feel proud of\r\nhaving been received into that family.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nWhen I joined the circle of Tchaykóvsky, I found its members hotly\r\ndiscussing the direction to be given to their activity. Some were in\r\nfavour of continuing to carry on radical and socialistic propaganda\r\namong the educated youth; but others thought that the sole aim of this\r\nwork should be to prepare men who would be capable of arousing the\r\ngreat inert labouring masses, and that their chief activity ought to\r\nbe among the peasants and workmen in the towns. In all the circles and\r\ngroups which were formed at that time by the hundred at St. Petersburg\r\nand in the provinces the same discussions went on, and everywhere the\r\nsecond programme prevailed over the first.\r\n\r\nIf our youth had merely taken to socialism in the abstract, it might\r\nhave felt satisfied with a mere declaration of socialist principles,\r\nincluding as a distant aim ‘the communistic possession of the\r\ninstruments of production,’ and in the meantime it might have carried\r\non some sort of political agitation. Many middle-class socialist\r\npoliticians in Western Europe and America really take this course.\r\nBut our youth had been drawn to socialism in quite another way. They\r\nwere not theorisers about socialism, but had become socialists by\r\nliving no richer than the workers live, by making no distinction\r\nbetween ‘mine and thine’ in their circles, and by refusing to enjoy\r\nfor their own satisfaction the riches they had inherited from their\r\nfathers. They had done with regard to capitalism what Tolstóy advises\r\nshould now be done with regard to war--that is, that people, instead\r\nof criticizing war and continuing to wear the military uniform, should\r\nrefuse, each one for himself, to be a soldier and to use arms. In the\r\nsame way our Russian youth, each one for himself or herself, refused\r\nto take personal advantage of the revenues of their fathers, Such a\r\nyouth had to go to the people--and they went. Thousands and thousands\r\nof young men and women had already left their homes, and tried now\r\nto live in the villages and the industrial towns in all possible\r\ncapacities. This was not an organized movement: it was one of those\r\nmass movements which occur at certain periods of sudden awakening of\r\nhuman conscience. Now that small organized groups were formed, ready to\r\ntry a systematic effort for spreading ideas of freedom and revolt in\r\nRussia, they were forcibly brought to carry on that propaganda amidst\r\nthe dark masses of peasants and workers in the towns. Various writers\r\nhave tried to explain this movement ‘to the people’ by influences from\r\nabroad--‘foreign agitators’ is everywhere a favourite explanation.\r\nIt is certainly true that our youth listened to the mighty voice of\r\nBakúnin, and that the agitation of the International Workingmen’s\r\nAssociation had a fascinating effect upon us. But the movement ‘V\r\nnaród’--To the people--had a far deeper origin: it began before\r\n‘foreign agitators’ had spoken to the Russian youth, and even before\r\nthe International Association had been founded. It began already in the\r\ngroups of Karakózoff in 1866; Turguéneff saw it coming, and already in\r\n1859 faintly indicated it. I did my best to promote that movement in\r\nthe circle of Tchaykóvsky; but I was only working with the tide, which\r\nwas infinitely more powerful than any individual efforts.\r\n\r\nWe often spoke, of course, of the necessity of a political agitation\r\nagainst our absolute government. We saw already that the mass of the\r\npeasants were being driven to unavoidable and irremediable ruin by\r\nfoolish taxation, and by the still more foolish selling off of their\r\ncattle to cover the arrears of taxes. We, ‘visionaries,’ saw coming\r\nthat complete ruin of a whole population which by this time, alas, has\r\nbeen accomplished to an appalling extent in Central Russia, and is\r\nconfessed by the government itself. We knew how, in every direction,\r\nRussia was being plundered in a most scandalous manner. We knew, and\r\nwe learned more every day, of the lawlessness of the functionaries,\r\nand the almost incredible bestiality of many among them. We heard\r\ncontinually of friends whose houses were raided at night by the police,\r\nwho disappeared in prisons, and who--we ascertained later on--had\r\nbeen transported without judgment to hamlets in some remote province\r\nof Russia. We felt, therefore, the necessity of a political struggle\r\nagainst this terrible power, which was crushing the best intellectual\r\nforces of the nation. But we saw no possible ground, legal or\r\nsemi-legal, for such a struggle.\r\n\r\nOur elder brothers did not want our socialistic aspirations, and we\r\ncould not part with them. Nay, even if some of us had done so, it\r\nwould have been of no avail. The young generation, as a whole, were\r\ntreated as ‘suspects,’ and the elder generation feared to have anything\r\nto do with them. Every young man of democratic tastes, every young\r\nwoman following a course of higher education, was a suspect in the\r\neyes of the state police, and was denounced by Katkóff as an enemy of\r\nthe state. Cropped hair and blue spectacles worn by a girl, a Scotch\r\nplaid worn in winter by a student, instead of an overcoat, which were\r\nevidences of Nihilist simplicity and democracy, were denounced as\r\ntokens of ‘political unreliability.’ If any student’s lodging came to\r\nbe frequently visited by other students, it was periodically invaded\r\nby the state police and searched. So common were the night raids in\r\ncertain students’ lodgings that Kelnitz once said, in his mildly\r\nhumorous way, to the police officer who was searching the rooms: ‘Why\r\nshould you go through all our books, each time you come to make a\r\nsearch? You might as well have a list of them, and then come once a\r\nmonth to see if they are all on the shelves; and you might, from time\r\nto time, add the titles of the new ones.’ The slightest suspicion of\r\npolitical unreliability was sufficient ground upon which to take a\r\nyoung man from a high school, to imprison him for several months,\r\nand finally to send him to some remote province of the Urals--‘for\r\nan undetermined term,’ as they used to say in their bureaucratic\r\nslang. Even at the time when the circle of Tchaykóvsky did nothing\r\nbut distribute books, all of which had been printed with the censor’s\r\napproval, Tchaykóvsky was twice arrested and kept some four or six\r\nmonths in prison--on the second occasion at a critical time of his\r\ncareer as a chemist. His researches had recently been published in the\r\nBulletin of the Academy of Sciences, and he had come up for his final\r\nuniversity examinations. He was released at last, because the police\r\ncould not discover sufficient evidence against him to warrant his\r\ntransportation to the Urals! ‘But if we arrest you once more,’ he was\r\ntold, ‘we shall send you to Siberia.’ In fact, it was a favourite dream\r\nof Alexander II. to have, somewhere in the steppes, a special town,\r\nguarded night and day by patrols of Cossacks, where all suspected young\r\npeople could be sent, so as to make of them a city of ten or twenty\r\nthousand inhabitants. Only the menace which such a city might some day\r\noffer prevented him from carrying out this truly Asiatic scheme.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of our members, an officer, had belonged to a group of young men\r\nwhose ambition was to serve in the provincial _Zémstvos_ (district\r\nand county councils). They regarded work in this direction as a high\r\nmission, and prepared themselves for it by serious studies of the\r\neconomical conditions of Central Russia. Many young people cherished\r\nfor a time the same hopes; but all these hopes vanished at the first\r\ncontact with the actual government machinery.\r\n\r\nHaving granted institutions of a very limited form of self-government\r\nto certain provinces of Russia, the government, immediately after\r\nhaving passed that law, directed all its efforts to reduce that reform\r\nto nothing and to deprive it of all its meaning and vitality. The\r\nprovincial ‘self-government’ had to content itself with the mere\r\nfunction of state officials who would collect additional local taxes\r\nand spend them for the local needs of the state. Every attempt of the\r\ncounty councils to take the initiative in any improvement--schools,\r\nteachers’ colleges, sanitary measures, agricultural improvements,\r\netc.--was met by the central government with suspicion--nay with\r\nhatred--and denounced by the ‘Moscow Gazette’ as ‘separatism,’ as the\r\ncreation of ‘a state within the state,’ as rebellion against autocracy.\r\n\r\nIf anyone were to tell the true history, for example, of the teachers’\r\ncollege of Tver, or of any similar undertaking of a Zémstvo in\r\nthose years, with all the petty persecutions, the prohibitions, the\r\nsuspensions, and what not with which the institution was harassed,\r\nno West European, and especially no American reader, would believe\r\nit. He would throw the book aside, saying, ‘It cannot be true; it\r\nis too stupid to be true.’ And yet it was so. Whole groups of the\r\nelected representatives of several Zémstvos were deprived of their\r\nfunctions, ordered to leave their province and their estates, or were\r\nsimply exiled, for having dared to petition the emperor in the most\r\nloyal manner concerning such rights as belonged to the Zémstvos by\r\nlaw. ‘The elected members of the provincial councils must be simple\r\nministerial functionaries, and obey the Minister of the Interior:’\r\nsuch was the theory of the St. Petersburg government. As to the less\r\nprominent people--teachers, doctors, and the like, in the service\r\nof the local councils--they were removed and exiled by the state\r\npolice in twenty-four hours, without further ceremony than an order\r\nof the omnipotent Third Section of the imperial chancelry. No longer\r\nago than last year, a lady whose husband is a rich landowner and\r\noccupies a prominent position in one of the Zémstvos, and who is\r\nherself interested in education, invited eight schoolmasters to her\r\nbirthday party. ‘Poor men,’ she said to herself, ‘they never have\r\nthe opportunity of seeing anyone but the peasants.’ The day after\r\nthe party the village policeman called at the mansion and insisted\r\nupon having the names of the eight teachers, in order to report them\r\nto the police authorities. The lady refused to give the names. ‘Very\r\nwell,’ he replied, ‘I will find them out, nevertheless, and make my\r\nreport. Teachers _must not_ come together, and I am bound to report\r\nif they do.’ The high position of the lady sheltered the teachers in\r\nthis case; but if they had met in the lodgings of one of their own\r\nnumber they would have received a visit from the state police, and\r\nhalf of them would have been dismissed by the Ministry of Education;\r\nand if, moreover, an angry word had escaped from one of them during\r\nthe police raid, he or she would have been sent to some province of\r\nthe Urals. This is what happens to-day, thirty-three years after the\r\nopening of the county and district councils; but it was far worse in\r\nthe seventies. What sort of basis for a political struggle could such\r\ninstitutions offer?\r\n\r\nWhen I inherited from my father his Tambóv estate, I thought very\r\nseriously for a time of settling on that estate, and devoting my energy\r\nto work in the local Zémstvo. Some peasants and the poorer priests of\r\nthe neighbourhood asked me to do so. As for myself, I should have been\r\ncontent with anything I could do, no matter how small it might be, if\r\nonly it would help to raise the intellectual level and the well-being\r\nof the peasants. But one day, when several of my advisers were\r\ntogether, I asked them: ‘Supposing I were to try to start a school, an\r\nexperimental farm, a co-operative enterprise, and, at the same time,\r\nalso took upon myself the defence of that peasant from our village who\r\nhas lately been wronged--would the authorities let me do it?’ ‘Never!’\r\nwas the unanimous reply.\r\n\r\nAn old grey-haired priest, a man who was held in great esteem in our\r\nneighbourhood, came to me a few days later, with two influential\r\ndissenting leaders, and said: ‘Talk with these two men. If you can\r\nmanage it, go with them and, Bible in hand, preach to the peasants....\r\nWell, you know what to preach.... No police in the world will find you,\r\nif they conceal you.... There’s nothing to be done besides; that’s what\r\nI, an old man, advise you.’\r\n\r\nI told them frankly why I could not assume the part of Wiclif. But\r\nthe old man was right. A movement similar to that of the Lollards is\r\nrapidly growing now amongst the Russian peasants. Such tortures as have\r\nbeen inflicted on the peace-loving Dukhobórs, and such raids upon the\r\npeasant dissenters in South Russia as were made in 1897, when children\r\nwere kidnapped so that they might be educated in orthodox monasteries,\r\nwill only give to that movement a force that it could not have attained\r\nfive-and-twenty years ago.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs the question of agitation for a constitution was continually being\r\nraised in our discussions, I once proposed to our circle to take it up\r\nseriously and to choose an appropriate plan of action. I was always\r\nof the opinion that when the circle decided anything unanimously,\r\neach member ought to put aside his personal feeling and give all his\r\nstrength to the task. ‘If you decide to agitate for a constitution,’ I\r\nsaid, ‘this is my plan: I will separate myself from you, for appearance\r\nsake, and maintain relations with only one member of the circle--for\r\ninstance, Tchaykóvsky--through whom I shall be kept informed how you\r\nsucceed in your work, and can communicate to you in a general way\r\nwhat I am doing. My work will be among the courtiers and the higher\r\nfunctionaries. I have among them many acquaintances, and know a\r\nnumber of persons who are disgusted with the present conditions. I\r\nwill bring them together and unite them, if possible, into a sort of\r\norganization; and then, some day, there is sure to be an opportunity\r\nto direct all these forces toward compelling Alexander II. to give\r\nRussia a constitution. There certainly will come a time when all these\r\npeople, feeling that they are compromised, will in their own interest\r\ntake a decisive step. If it is necessary, some of us, who have been\r\nofficers, might be very helpful in extending the propaganda amongst\r\nthe officers in the army; but this action must be quite separate from\r\nyours, though parallel with it. I have seriously thought of it. I know\r\nwhat connections I have and who can be trusted, and I believe some of\r\nthe discontented already look upon me as a possible centre for some\r\naction of this sort. This course is not the one I should take of my own\r\nchoice; but if you think that it is best, I will give myself to it with\r\nmight and main.’\r\n\r\nThe circle did not accept that proposal. Knowing one another as well as\r\nthey did, my comrades probably thought that if I went in this direction\r\nI should cease to be true to myself. For my own personal happiness, for\r\nmy own personal life, I cannot feel too grateful now that my proposal\r\nwas not accepted. I should have gone in a direction which was not the\r\none dictated by my own nature, and I should not have found in it the\r\npersonal happiness which I have found in other paths. But when, six\r\nor seven years later, the terrorists were engaged in their terrible\r\nstruggle against Alexander II., I regretted that there had not been\r\nsomebody else to do the sort of work I had proposed to do in the higher\r\ncircles at St. Petersburg. With some understanding there beforehand,\r\nand with the ramifications which such an understanding probably would\r\nhave taken all over the empire, the holocausts of victims would not\r\nhave been made in vain. At any rate, the underground work of the\r\nexecutive committee ought by all means to have been supported by a\r\nparallel agitation at the Winter Palace.\r\n\r\nOver and over again the necessity of a political effort thus came under\r\ndiscussion in our little group, with no result. The apathy and the\r\nindifference of the wealthier classes were hopeless, and the irritation\r\namong the persecuted youth had not yet been brought to that high pitch\r\nwhich ended, six years later, in the struggle of the terrorists under\r\nthe Executive Committee. Nay--and this is one of the most tragical\r\nironies of history--it was the same youth whom Alexander II., in\r\nhis blind fear and fury, ordered to be sent by the hundred to hard\r\nlabour and condemned to slow death in exile; it was the same youth who\r\nprotected him in 1871-78. The very teachings of the socialist circles\r\nwere such as to prevent the repetition of a Karakózoff attempt on the\r\nTsar’s life. ‘Prepare in Russia a great socialist mass movement amongst\r\nthe workers and the peasants,’ was the watchword in those times. ‘Don’t\r\ntrouble about the Tsar and his counsellors. If such a movement begins,\r\nif the peasants join in the mass movement to claim the land and to\r\nabolish the serfdom redemption taxes, the imperial power will be the\r\nfirst to seek support in the moneyed classes and the landlords and to\r\nconvoke a Parliament--just as the peasant insurrection in France in\r\n1789 compelled the royal power to convoke the National Assembly; so it\r\nwill be in Russia.’\r\n\r\nBut there was more than that. Separate men and groups, seeing that the\r\nreign of Alexander II. was hopelessly doomed to sink deeper and deeper\r\nin reaction, and entertaining at the same time vague hopes as to the\r\nsupposed ‘liberalism’ of the heir-apparent--all young heirs to thrones\r\nare supposed to be liberal--persistently reverted to the idea that the\r\nexample of Karakózoff ought to be followed. The organized circles,\r\nhowever, strenuously opposed such an idea, and urged their comrades not\r\nto resort to that course of action. I may now divulge the following\r\nfact, which has hitherto remained unknown. When a young man came to\r\nSt. Petersburg from one of the southern provinces with the firm\r\nintention of killing Alexander II., and some members of the Tchaykóvsky\r\ncircle learned of his plan, they not only applied all the weight of\r\ntheir arguments to dissuade the young man, but, when he would not be\r\ndissuaded, they informed him that they would keep a watch over him and\r\nprevent him by force from making any such attempt. Knowing well how\r\nloosely guarded the Winter Palace was at that time, I can positively\r\nsay that they saved the life of Alexander II. So firmly were the youth\r\nopposed at that time to the war in which later, when the cup of their\r\nsufferings was filled to overflowing, they took part.\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nThe two years that I worked with the circle of Tchaykóvsky, before I\r\nwas arrested, left a deep impression upon all my subsequent life and\r\nthought. During those two years it was life under high pressure--that\r\nexuberance of life when one feels at every moment the full throbbing of\r\nall the fibres of the inner self, and when life is really worth living.\r\nI was in a family of men and women so closely united by their common\r\nobject, and so broadly and delicately humane in their mutual relations,\r\nthat I cannot now recall a single moment of even temporary friction\r\nmarring the life of our circle. Those who have had any experience of\r\npolitical agitation will appreciate the value of this statement.\r\n\r\nBefore abandoning entirely my scientific career, I considered\r\nmyself bound to finish the report of my journey to Finland for the\r\nGeographical Society, as well as some other work that I had in hand\r\nfor the same society; and my new friends were the first to confirm me\r\nin that decision. It would not be fair, they said, to do otherwise.\r\nConsequently, I worked hard to finish my geological and geographical\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\nMeetings of our circle were frequent, and I never missed them. We used\r\nto meet then in a suburban part of St. Petersburg, in a small house\r\nof which Sophie Peróvskaya, under the assumed name and the fabricated\r\npassport of an artisan’s wife, was the supposed tenant. She was born\r\nof a very aristocratic family, and her father had been for some time\r\nthe military governor of St. Petersburg; but, with the approval of\r\nher mother, who adored her, she had left her home to join a high\r\nschool, and with the three sisters Korníloff--daughters of a rich\r\nmanufacturer--she had founded that little circle of self-education\r\nwhich later on became our circle. Now, in the capacity of an artisan’s\r\nwife, in her cotton dress and men’s boots, her head covered with a\r\ncotton kerchief, as she carried on her shoulders her two pails of\r\nwater from the Nevá, no one would have recognized in her the girl who\r\na few years before shone in one of the most fashionable drawing-rooms\r\nof the capital. She was a general favourite, and every one of us,\r\non entering the house, had a specially friendly smile for her--even\r\nwhen she, making a point of honour of keeping the house relatively\r\nclean, quarrelled with us about the dirt which we, dressed in peasant\r\ntop-boots and sheepskins, brought in after walking the muddy streets\r\nof the suburbs. She tried then to give to her girlish, innocent, and\r\nvery intelligent little face the most severe expression possible to it.\r\nIn her moral conceptions she was a ‘rigorist,’ but not in the least of\r\nthe sermon-preaching type. When she was dissatisfied with some one’s\r\nconduct, she would cast a severe glance at him from beneath her brows;\r\nbut in that glance one saw her open-minded, generous nature, which\r\nunderstood all that is human. On one point only she was inexorable. ‘A\r\nwomen’s man,’ she once said, speaking of some one, and the expression\r\nand the manner in which she said it, without interrupting her work, is\r\nengraved for ever in my memory.\r\n\r\nPeróvskaya was a ‘popularist’ to the very bottom of her heart, and\r\nat the same time a revolutionist, a fighter of the truest steel. She\r\nhad no need to embellish the workers and the peasants with imaginary\r\nvirtues in order to love them and to work for them. She took them as\r\nthey were, and said to me once: ‘We have begun a great thing. Two\r\ngenerations, perhaps, will succumb in the task, and yet it must be\r\ndone.’ None of the women of our circle would have given way before\r\nthe certainty of death on the scaffold. Each would have looked\r\ndeath straight in the face. But none of them, at that stage of our\r\npropaganda, thought of such a fate. Peróvskaya’s well-known portrait\r\nis exceptionally good; it records so well her earnest courage, her\r\nbright intelligence, and her loving nature. The letter she wrote to her\r\nmother a few hours before she went to the scaffold is one of the best\r\nexpressions of a loving soul that a woman’s heart ever dictated.\r\n\r\nThe following incident will show what the other women of our circle\r\nwere. One night, Kupreyánoff and I went to Varvara B., to whom we had\r\nto make an urgent communication. It was past midnight, but, seeing a\r\nlight in her window, we went upstairs. She sat in her tiny room at a\r\ntable copying a programme of our circle. We knew how resolute she was,\r\nand the idea came to us to make one of those stupid jokes men sometimes\r\nthink funny. ‘B.,’ I said, ‘we come to fetch you: we are going to\r\ntry a rather mad attempt to liberate our friends from the fortress.’\r\nShe asked not one question. She quietly laid down her pen, rose from\r\nher chair, and said only, ‘Let us go.’ She spoke in so simple, so\r\nunaffected a voice that I felt at once how foolishly I had acted, and\r\ntold her the truth. She dropped back into her chair, with tears in her\r\neyes, and in a despairing voice asked: ‘It was only a joke? Why do you\r\nmake _such_ jokes?’ I fully realized then the cruelty of what I had\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother general favourite in our circle was Serghéi Kravchínsky, who\r\nbecame so well known, both in England and in the United States, under\r\nthe name of Stepniák. He was often called ‘the Baby,’ so unconcerned\r\nwas he about his own security: but his carelessness about himself was\r\nmerely the result of a complete absence of fear, which, after all, is\r\noften the best policy for one who is hunted by the police. He soon\r\nbecame well known for his propaganda in the circles of workers, under\r\nhis real Christian name of Serghéi, and consequently was very much\r\nwanted by the police; notwithstanding that, he took no precautions\r\nwhatever to conceal himself, and I remember that one day he was\r\nseverely scolded at one of our meetings for what was described as a\r\ngross imprudence. Being late for the meeting, as he often was, and\r\nhaving a long distance to cover in order to reach our house, he,\r\ndressed as a peasant in his sheepskin, ran the whole length of a great\r\nmain thoroughfare at full speed in the middle of the street. ‘How\r\ncould you do it?’ he was reproachfully asked. ‘You might have aroused\r\nsuspicion, and have been arrested as a common thief.’ But I wish that\r\neveryone had been as cautious as he was in affairs where other people\r\ncould be compromised.\r\n\r\nWe made our first intimate acquaintance over Stanley’s book, ‘How\r\nI Discovered Livingstone.’ One night our meeting had lasted till\r\ntwelve, and as we were about to leave, one of the Korníloffs entered\r\nwith a book in her hand, and asked who among us could undertake to\r\ntranslate by the next morning at eight o’clock sixteen printed pages\r\nof Stanley’s book. I looked at the size of the pages, and said that if\r\nsomebody would help me the work could be done during the night. Serghéi\r\nvolunteered, and by four o’clock the sixteen pages were done. We read\r\nto each other our translations, one of us following the English text;\r\nthen we emptied a jar of Russian porridge which had been left on the\r\ntable for us, and went out together to return home. We became close\r\nfriends from that night.\r\n\r\nI have always liked people capable of working, and doing their work\r\nproperly. So Serghéi’s translation and his capacity of working rapidly\r\nhad already influenced me in his favour. But when I came to know more\r\nof him, I felt real love for his honest, frank nature, for his youthful\r\nenergy and good sense, for his superior intelligence, simplicity, and\r\ntruthfulness, and for his courage and tenacity. He had read and thought\r\na great deal, and upon the revolutionary character of the struggle\r\nwhich we had undertaken it appeared we had similar views. He was ten\r\nyears younger than I was, and perhaps did not quite realize what a\r\nhard contest the coming revolution would be. He told us later on, with\r\nmuch humour, how he once worked among the peasants in the country.\r\n‘One day,’ he said, ‘I was walking along the road with a comrade\r\nwhen we were overtaken by a peasant in a sleigh. I began to tell the\r\npeasant that he must not pay taxes, that the functionaries plunder the\r\npeople, and I tried to convince him by quotations from the Bible that\r\nthey must revolt. The peasant whipped up his horse, but we followed\r\nrapidly; he made his horse trot, and we began to run behind him; all\r\nthe time I continued to talk to him about taxes and revolt. Finally he\r\nmade his horse gallop; but the animal was not worth much--an underfed\r\npeasant pony--so my comrade and I did not fall behind, but kept up our\r\npropaganda till we were quite out of breath.’\r\n\r\nFor some time Serghéi stayed in Kazán, and I had to correspond with\r\nhim. He always hated writing letters in cipher, so I proposed a means\r\nof correspondence which had often been used before in conspiracies.\r\nYou write an ordinary letter about all sorts of things, but in this\r\nletter it is only certain words--let us say, every fifth word--which\r\nhas a meaning. You write, for instance: ‘Excuse my hurried letter.\r\nCome to-night to see me; to-morrow I shall go away to my sister. My\r\nbrother Nicholas feels worse; it was late to make an operation.’\r\nReading each fifth word, you find: ‘Come to-morrow to Nicholas, late.’\r\nWe had to write letters of six or seven pages to transmit one page\r\nof information, and we had to cultivate our imagination in order to\r\nfill the letters with all sorts of things by way of introducing the\r\nwords that were required. Serghéi, from whom it was impossible to\r\nobtain a cipher letter, took to this kind of correspondence, and used\r\nto send me letters containing stories with thrilling incidents and\r\ndramatic endings. He said to me afterward that this correspondence\r\nhelped to develop his literary talent. When one has talent, everything\r\ncontributes to its development.\r\n\r\nIn January or February 1874 I was at Moscow, in one of the houses in\r\nwhich I had spent my childhood. Early in the morning I was told that\r\na peasant desired to see me. I went out and found it was Serghéi, who\r\nhad just escaped from Tver. He was strongly built, and he, with another\r\nex-officer, Rogachóff, endowed with equal physical strength, went\r\ntravelling about the country as lumber sawyers. The work was very hard,\r\nespecially for inexperienced hands, but both of them liked it; and no\r\none would have thought to look for disguised officers in these two\r\nstrong sawyers. They wandered in this capacity for about a fortnight\r\nwithout arousing suspicion, and made revolutionary propaganda right\r\nand left without fear. Sometimes Serghéi, who knew the New Testament\r\nalmost by heart, spoke to the peasants as a religious preacher,\r\nproving to them by quotations from the Bible that they ought to start\r\na revolution. Sometimes he formed his arguments of quotations from the\r\neconomists. The peasants listened to the two men as to real apostles,\r\ntook them from one house to another, and refused to be paid for food.\r\nIn a fortnight they had produced quite a stir in a number of villages.\r\nTheir fame was spreading far and wide. The peasants, young and old,\r\nbegan to whisper to one another in the barns about the ‘delegates;’\r\nthey began to speak out more loudly than they usually did that the land\r\nwould soon be taken from the landlords, who would receive pensions from\r\nthe Tsar. The younger people became more aggressive toward the police\r\nofficers, saying: ‘Wait a little; our turn will come soon: you Herods\r\nwill not rule long now.’ But the fame of the sawyers reached the ears\r\nof one of the police authorities, and they were arrested. An order was\r\ngiven to take them to the next police official, ten miles away.\r\n\r\nThey were taken under the guard of several peasants, and on their\r\nway had to pass through a village which was holding its festival.\r\n‘Prisoners? All right! Come on here, my uncle,’ said the peasants, who\r\nwere all drinking in honour of the occasion. They were kept nearly the\r\nwhole day in that village, the peasants taking them from one house to\r\nanother, and treating them to home-made beer. The guards did not have\r\nto be asked twice. They drank, and insisted that the prisoners should\r\ndrink too. ‘Happily,’ Serghéi said, ‘they gave us the beer in such\r\nlarge wooden bowls, which were passed round, that I could put my mouth\r\nto the rim of the bowl as if I were drinking, but no one could see how\r\nmuch beer I had imbibed.’ The guards were all drunk toward night, and\r\npreferred not to appear in this state before the police officer, so\r\nthey decided to stay in the village till morning. Serghéi kept talking\r\nto them, and all listened to him, regretting that such a good man had\r\nbeen caught. As they were going to sleep, a young peasant whispered to\r\nSerghéi, ‘When I go to shut the gate I will leave it unbolted.’ Serghéi\r\nand his comrade understood the hint, and as soon as all fell asleep\r\nthey went out into the street. They started at a fast pace, and at\r\nfive o’clock in the morning were twenty miles away from the village,\r\nat a small railway station, where they took the first train, and went\r\nto Moscow. Serghéi remained there, and later, when all of us at St.\r\nPetersburg had been arrested, the Moscow circle, under his inspiration,\r\nbecame the main centre of the agitation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere and there, small groups of propagandists had settled in towns and\r\nvillages in various capacities. Blacksmiths’ shops and small farms\r\nhad been started, and young men of the wealthier classes worked in\r\nthe shops or on the farms, to be in daily contact with the toiling\r\nmasses. At Moscow, a number of young girls, of rich families, who\r\nhad studied at the Zürich university and had started a separate\r\norganization, went even so far as to enter cotton factories, where they\r\nworked from fourteen to sixteen hours a day, and lived in the factory\r\nbarracks the miserable life of the Russian factory girls. It was a\r\ngrand movement, in which, at the lowest estimate, from two to three\r\nthousand persons took an active part, while twice or thrice as many\r\nsympathizers and supporters helped the active vanguard in various ways.\r\nWith a good half of that army our St. Petersburg circle was in regular\r\ncorrespondence--always, of course, in cipher.\r\n\r\nThe literature which could be published in Russia under a rigorous\r\ncensorship--the faintest hint of socialism being prohibited--was\r\nsoon found insufficient, and we started a printing office of our own\r\nabroad. Pamphlets for the workers and the peasants had to be written,\r\nand our small ‘literary committee,’ of which I was a member, had its\r\nhands full of work. Serghéi wrote a couple of such pamphlets--one\r\nin the Lamennais style, and another containing an exposition of\r\nsocialism in a fairy tale--and both had a wide circulation. The books\r\nand pamphlets which were printed abroad were smuggled into Russia by\r\nthousands, stored at certain spots, and sent out to the local circles,\r\nwhich distributed them amongst the peasants and the workers. All this\r\nrequired a vast organization as well as much travelling about, and a\r\ncolossal correspondence, particularly for protecting our helpers and\r\nour bookstores from the police. We had special ciphers for different\r\nprovincial circles, and often, after six or seven hours had been passed\r\nin discussing all details, the women, who did not trust to our accuracy\r\nin the cipher correspondence, spent all the night in covering sheets of\r\npaper with cabalistic figures and fractions.\r\n\r\nThe utmost cordiality always prevailed at our meetings. Chairmen and\r\nall sorts of formalism are so utterly repugnant to the Russian mind\r\nthat we had none; and although our debates were sometimes extremely\r\nhot, especially when ‘programme questions’ were under discussion, we\r\nalways managed very well without resorting to Western formalities. An\r\nabsolute sincerity, a general desire to settle the difficulties for the\r\nbest, and a frankly expressed contempt for all that in the least degree\r\napproached theatrical affectation were quite sufficient. If anyone of\r\nus had ventured to attempt oratorical effects by a speech, friendly\r\njokes would have shown him at once that speech-making was out of\r\nplace. Often we had to take our meals during these meetings, and they\r\ninvariably consisted of rye bread, with cucumbers, a bit of cheese, and\r\nplenty of weak tea to quench the thirst. Not that money was lacking;\r\nthere was always enough, and yet there was never too much to cover\r\nthe steadily growing expenses for printing, transportation of books,\r\nconcealing friends wanted by the police, and starting new enterprises.\r\n\r\nAt St. Petersburg it was not long before we had wide acquaintance\r\namongst the workers. Serdukóff, a young man of splendid education, had\r\nmade a number of friends amongst the engineers, most of them employed\r\nin a state factory of the artillery department, and he had organized\r\na circle of about thirty members, who used to meet for reading and\r\ndiscussion. The engineers are pretty well paid at St. Petersburg, and\r\nthose who were not married were fairly well off. They soon became quite\r\nfamiliar with the current radical and socialist literature--Buckle,\r\nLassalle, Mill, Draper, Spielhagen, were familiar names to them; and\r\nin their aspect these engineers differed little from students. When\r\nKelnitz, Serghéi, and I joined the circle, we frequently visited their\r\ngroup, and gave them informal lectures upon all sorts of things.\r\nOur hopes, however, that these young men would grow into ardent\r\npropagandists amidst less privileged classes of workers were not fully\r\nrealised. In a free country they would have been the habitual speakers\r\nat public meetings; but, like the privileged workers of the watch trade\r\nin Geneva, they treated the mass of the factory hands with a sort of\r\ncontempt, and were in no haste to become martyrs to the socialist\r\ncause. It was only after they had been arrested and kept three or four\r\nyears in prison for having dared to _think_ as socialists, and had\r\nsounded the full depth of Russian absolutism, that several of them\r\ndeveloped into ardent propagandists, chiefly of a political revolution.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy sympathies went especially toward the weavers and the workers in the\r\ncotton factories. There are many thousands of them at St. Petersburg,\r\nwho work there during the winter, and return for the three summer\r\nmonths to their native villages to cultivate the land. Half peasants\r\nand half town workers, they had generally retained the social spirit of\r\nthe Russian villager. The movement spread like wildfire among them. We\r\nhad to restrain the zeal of our new friends; otherwise they would have\r\nbrought to our lodgings hundreds at a time, young and old. Most of them\r\nlived in small associations, or _artéls_, ten or twelve persons hiring\r\na common apartment and taking their meals together, each one paying\r\nevery month his share of the general expenses. It was to these lodgings\r\nthat we used to go, and the weavers soon brought us in contact with\r\nother _artéls_ of stonemasons, carpenters, and the like. In some of\r\nthese _artéls_ Serghéi, Kelnitz, and a couple more of our friends were\r\nquite at home, and spent whole nights talking about socialism. Besides,\r\nwe had in different parts of St. Petersburg special apartments, kept\r\nby some of our people, to which ten or twelve workers would come every\r\nnight to learn reading and writing, and after that to have a talk. From\r\ntime to time one of us went to the native villages of our town friends,\r\nand spent a couple of weeks in almost open propaganda amongst the\r\npeasants.\r\n\r\nOf course, all of us who had to deal with this class of workers had\r\nto dress like the workers themselves--that is, to wear the peasant\r\ngarb. The gap between the peasants and the educated people is so great\r\nin Russia, and contact between them is so rare, that not only does\r\nthe appearance in a village of a man who wears the town dress awaken\r\ngeneral attention, but even in town, if one whose talk and dress reveal\r\nthat he is not a worker is seen to go about with workers, the suspicion\r\nof the police is aroused at once. ‘Why should he go about with “low\r\npeople,” if he has not a bad intention?’ Often, after a dinner in a\r\nrich mansion, or even in the Winter Palace, where I went frequently to\r\nsee a friend, I took a cab, hurried to a poor student’s lodging in a\r\nremote suburb, exchanged my fine clothes for a cotton shirt, peasant’s\r\ntop-boots, and a sheepskin, and, joking with peasants on the way, went\r\nto meet my worker friends in some slum. I told them what I had seen of\r\nthe labour movement abroad. They listened with an eager attention; they\r\nlost not a word of what was said; and then came the question, ‘What\r\ncan we do in Russia?’ ‘Agitate, organize,’ was our reply; ‘there is no\r\nroyal road;’ and we read them a popular story of the French Revolution,\r\nan adaptation of Erckmann-Chatrian’s admirable ‘Histoire d’un Paysan.’\r\nEvery one admired M. Chovel, who went as a propagandist through the\r\nvillages colporting prohibited books, and burned to follow in his\r\nfootsteps. ‘Speak to others,’ we said; ‘bring men together; and when\r\nwe become more numerous, we shall see what we can attain.’ They fully\r\nunderstood, and we had only to moderate their zeal.\r\n\r\nAmongst them I passed my happiest hours. New Year’s day of 1874, the\r\nlast I spent in Russia at liberty, is especially memorable to me. The\r\nprevious evening I had been in a choice company. Inspiring, noble words\r\nwere spoken that night about the citizen’s duties, the well-being of\r\nthe country, and the like. But underneath all the thrilling speeches,\r\none note resounded: How could each of the speakers preserve his own\r\npersonal well-being? Yet no one had the courage to say, frankly and\r\nopenly, that he was ready to do only that which would not endanger\r\nhis own dovecote. Sophisms--no end of sophisms--about the slowness\r\nof evolution, the inertia of the lower classes, the uselessness of\r\nsacrifice, were uttered to justify the unspoken words, all intermingled\r\nwith assurances of each one’s willingness to make sacrifices. I\r\nreturned home, seized suddenly with profound sadness amid all this talk.\r\n\r\nNext morning I went to one of our weavers’ meetings. It took place in\r\nan underground dark room. I was dressed as a peasant, and was lost\r\nin the crowd of other sheepskins. My comrade, who was known to the\r\nworkers, simply introduced me: ‘Borodín, a friend.’ ‘Tell us, Borodín,’\r\nhe said, ‘what you have seen abroad.’ And I spoke of the labour\r\nmovement in Western Europe, its struggles, its difficulties, and its\r\nhopes.\r\n\r\nThe audience consisted mostly of middle-aged people. They were\r\nintensely interested. They asked me questions, all to the point,\r\nabout the minute details of the working-men’s unions, the aims of the\r\nInternational Association and its chances of success, and then came\r\nquestions about what could be done in Russia, and the prospects of our\r\npropaganda. I never minimized the dangers of our agitation, and frankly\r\nsaid what I thought. ‘_We_ shall probably be sent to Siberia, one of\r\nthese days; and you--part of you--will be kept long months in prison\r\nfor having listened to us.’ This gloomy prospect did not frighten them.\r\n‘After all, there are men in Siberia, too--not bears only.’ ‘Where men\r\nare living others can live.’ ‘The devil is not so terrible as they\r\npaint him.’ ‘If you are afraid of wolves, never go into the wood,’ they\r\nsaid as we parted. And when, afterward, several of them were arrested,\r\nthey nearly all behaved bravely, sheltering us and betraying no one.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nDuring the two years of which I am now speaking many arrests were made,\r\nboth at St. Petersburg and in the provinces. Not a month passed without\r\nour losing someone, or learning that members of this or that provincial\r\ngroup had disappeared. Toward the end of 1873 the arrests became more\r\nand more frequent. In November one of our main settlements in a suburb\r\nof St. Petersburg was raided by the police. We lost Peróvskaya and\r\nthree other friends, and all our relations with the workers in this\r\nsuburb had to be suspended. We founded a new settlement, further away\r\nfrom the town, but it had soon to be abandoned. The police became very\r\nvigilant, and the appearance of a student in the workmen’s quarters was\r\nnoticed at once; spies circulated among the workers, who were watched\r\nclosely. Dmítri Kelnitz, Serghéi, and myself, in our sheepskins and\r\nwith our pleasant looks, passed unnoticed, and continued to visit the\r\nhaunted ground. But Dmítri and Serghéi, whose names had acquired a wide\r\nnotoriety in the workmen’s quarters, were eagerly wanted by the police;\r\nand if they had been found accidentally during a nocturnal raid at a\r\nfriend’s lodgings they would have been arrested at once. There were\r\nperiods when Dmítri had every day to hunt for a place where he could\r\nspend the night in relative safety. ‘Can I stay the night with you?’ he\r\nwould ask, entering some comrade’s room at ten o’clock. ‘Impossible!\r\nmy lodgings have been closely watched lately. Better go to N----.’ ‘I\r\nhave just come from him, and he says spies swarm in his neighbourhood.’\r\n‘Then, go to M----; he is a great friend of mine, and above suspicion.\r\nBut it is far from here, and you must take a cab. Here is money.’ But,\r\non principle, Dmítri would not take a cab, and would walk to the other\r\nend of the town to find a refuge, or at last go to a friend whose rooms\r\nmight be searched at any given moment.\r\n\r\nEarly in January 1874, another settlement, our main stronghold\r\nfor propaganda amongst the weavers, was lost. Some of our best\r\npropagandists disappeared behind the gates of the mysterious Third\r\nSection. Our circle became narrower, general meetings were increasingly\r\ndifficult, and we made strenuous efforts to form new circles of young\r\nmen who might continue our work when we should all be arrested.\r\nTchaykóvsky was in the south, and we forced Dmítri and Serghéi to leave\r\nSt. Petersburg--actually forced them, imperiously ordering them to\r\nleave. Only five or six of us remained to transact all the business of\r\nour circle. I intended, as soon as I should have delivered my report to\r\nthe Geographical Society, to go to the south-west of Russia, and there\r\nto start a sort of land league, similar to the league which became so\r\npowerful in Ireland at the end of the seventies.\r\n\r\nAfter two months of relative quiet, we learned in the middle of March\r\nthat nearly all the circle of the engineers had been arrested, and\r\nwith them a young man named Nízovkin, an ex-student, who unfortunately\r\nhad their confidence, and, we were sure, would soon try to clear\r\nhimself by telling all he knew about us. Besides Dmítri and Serghéi he\r\nknew Serdukóff, the founder of the circle, and myself, and he would\r\ncertainly name us as soon as he was pressed with questions. A few days\r\nlater, two weavers--most unreliable fellows, who had even embezzled\r\nsome money from their comrades, and who knew me under the name of\r\nBorodín--were arrested. These two would surely set the police at once\r\nupon the track of Borodín, the man, dressed as a peasant, who spoke\r\nat the weavers’ meetings. Within a week’s time all the members of our\r\ncircle, excepting Serdukóff and myself, were arrested.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing left to us but to fly from St. Petersburg: this was\r\nexactly what we did not want to do. All our immense organization for\r\nprinting pamphlets abroad and for smuggling them into Russia; all the\r\nnetwork of circles, farms, and country settlements with which we were\r\nin correspondence in nearly forty (out of fifty) provinces of European\r\nRussia and which had been slowly built up during the last two years;\r\nfinally, our workers’ groups at St. Petersburg and our four different\r\ncentres for propaganda amongst workers of the capital--how could we\r\nabandon all these without having found men to maintain our relations\r\nand correspondence? Serdukóff and I decided to admit to our circle two\r\nnew members, and to transfer the business to them. We met every evening\r\nin different parts of the town, and as we never kept any addresses or\r\nnames in writing--the smuggling addresses alone had been deposited in\r\na secure place, in cipher--we had to teach our new members hundreds of\r\nnames and addresses and a dozen ciphers, repeating them over and over,\r\nuntil our friends had learned them by heart. Every evening we went over\r\nthe whole map of Russia in this way, dwelling especially on its western\r\nfrontier, which was studded with men and women engaged in receiving\r\nbooks from the smugglers, and the eastern provinces, where we had our\r\nmain settlements. Then, always in disguise, we had to take the new\r\nmembers to our sympathizers in the town, and introduce them to those\r\nwho had not yet been arrested.\r\n\r\nThe thing to be done in such a case was to disappear from one’s\r\napartments, and to re-appear somewhere else under an assumed name.\r\nSerdukóff had abandoned his lodging, but, having no passport, he\r\nconcealed himself in the houses of friends. I ought to have done the\r\nsame, but a strange circumstance prevented me. I had just finished my\r\nreport upon the glacial formations in Finland and Russia, and this\r\nreport had to be read at a meeting of the Geographical Society. The\r\ninvitations were already issued, but it happened that on the appointed\r\nday the two geological societies of St. Petersburg had a joint meeting,\r\nand they asked the Geographical Society to postpone the reading of my\r\nreport for a week. It was known that I was going to present certain\r\nideas about the extension of the ice cap as far as Middle Russia, and\r\nour geologists, with the exception of my friend and teacher, Friedrich\r\nSchmidt, considered this speculation of far too reaching a character,\r\nand wanted to have it thoroughly discussed. For one week more,\r\nconsequently, I could not go away.\r\n\r\nStrangers prowled about my house and called upon me under all sorts of\r\nfantastical pretexts: one of them wanted to buy a forest on my Tambóv\r\nestate, which was situated in absolutely treeless prairies. I noticed\r\nin my street--the fashionable Morskáya--one of the two arrested weavers\r\nwhom I have mentioned, and thus learned that my house was watched. Yet\r\nI had to act as if nothing extraordinary had happened, because I was to\r\nappear at the meeting of the Geographical Society the following Friday\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThe meeting came. The discussions were very animated, and one point,\r\nat least, was won. It was recognized that all old theories concerning\r\nthe diluvial period in Russia were totally baseless, and that a new\r\ndeparture must be made in the investigation of the whole question. I\r\nhad the satisfaction of hearing our leading geologist, Barbot-de-Marny,\r\nsay, ‘Ice cap or not, we must acknowledge, gentlemen, that all we\r\nhave hitherto said about the action of floating ice had no foundation\r\nwhatever in actual exploration.’ And I was proposed at that meeting to\r\nbe nominated president of the Physical Geography section, while I was\r\nasking myself whether I should not spend that very night in the prison\r\nof the Third Section.\r\n\r\nIt would have been best not to return at all to my apartment, but I\r\nwas broken down with fatigue after the exertions of the last few days,\r\nand went home. There was no police raid during that night. I looked\r\nthrough the heaps of my papers, destroyed everything that might be\r\ncompromising for anyone, packed all my things, and prepared to leave. I\r\nknew that my apartment was watched, but I hoped that the police would\r\nnot pay me a visit before late in the night, and that at dusk I could\r\nslip out of the house without being noticed. Dusk came, and, as I was\r\nstarting, one of the servant girls said to me, ‘You had better go by\r\nthe service staircase.’ I understood what she meant, and went quickly\r\ndown the staircase and out of the house. One cab only stood at the\r\ngate; I jumped into it. The driver took me to the great Perspective of\r\nNévsky. There was no pursuit at first, and I thought myself safe; but\r\npresently I noticed another cab running full speed after us; our horse\r\nwas delayed somehow, and the other cab passed ours.\r\n\r\nTo my astonishment, I saw in it one of the two arrested weavers,\r\naccompanied by someone else. He waved his hand as if he had something\r\nto tell me. I told my cabman to stop. ‘Perhaps,’ I thought, ‘he has\r\nbeen released from arrest, and has an important communication to make\r\nto me.’ But as soon as we stopped, the man who was with the weaver--he\r\nwas a detective--shouted loudly, ‘Mr. Borodín, Prince Kropótkin, I\r\narrest you!’ He made a signal to the policeman, of whom there are\r\nhosts along the main thoroughfare of St. Petersburg, and at the same\r\ntime jumped into my cab and showed me a paper which bore the stamp\r\nof the St. Petersburg police. ‘I have an order to take you before\r\nthe Governor-General for an explanation,’ he said. Resistance was\r\nimpossible--a couple of policemen were already close by--and I told my\r\ncabman to turn round and drive to the Governor-General’s house. The\r\nweaver remained in his cab and followed us.\r\n\r\nIt was now evident that the police had hesitated for ten days to arrest\r\nme, because they were not sure that Borodín and I were the same person.\r\nMy response to the weaver’s call had settled their doubts.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that just as I was leaving my house a young man came\r\nfrom Moscow, bringing me a letter from a friend, Voinarálsky, and\r\nanother from Dmítri, addressed to our friend Polakóff. The former\r\nannounced the establishment of a secret printing office at Moscow,\r\nand was full of cheerful news concerning the activity in that city. I\r\nread it and destroyed it. As the second letter contained nothing but\r\ninnocent friendly chat, I took it with me. Now that I was arrested I\r\nthought it would be better to destroy it, and, asking the detective\r\nto show me his paper again, I took advantage of the time that he was\r\nfumbling in his pocket to drop the letter on the pavement without his\r\nnoticing it. However, as we reached the Governor-General’s house the\r\nweaver handed it to the detective, saying, ‘I saw the gentleman drop\r\nthis letter on the pavement, so I picked it up.’\r\n\r\nNow came tedious hours of waiting for the representative of the\r\njudicial authorities, the procureur or public prosecutor. This\r\nfunctionary plays the part of a straw man, who is paraded by the State\r\npolice during their searches: he gives an aspect of legality to their\r\nproceedings. It was many hours before that gentleman was found and\r\nbrought to perform his functions as a sham representative of justice. I\r\nwas taken back to my house, and a most thorough search of all my papers\r\nwas made: this lasted till three in the morning, but did not reveal a\r\nscrap of paper that could tell against me or anyone else.\r\n\r\nFrom my house I was taken to the Third Section, that omnipotent\r\ninstitution which has ruled in Russia from the beginning of the reign\r\nof Nicholas I. down to the present time--a true ‘state in the state.’\r\nIt began under Peter I. in the Secret Department, where the adversaries\r\nof the founder of the Russian military empire were subjected to the\r\nmost abominable tortures, under which they expired; it was continued\r\nin the Secret Chancelry during the reigns of the Empresses, when the\r\nTorture Chamber of the powerful Minich inspired all Russia with terror;\r\nand it received its present organization from the iron despot, Nicholas\r\nI., who attached to it the corps of gendarmes--the chief of the\r\ngendarmes becoming a person far more dreaded in the Russian Empire than\r\nthe Emperor himself.\r\n\r\nIn every province of Russia, in every populous town, nay, at every\r\nrailway station, there are gendarmes who report directly to their own\r\ngenerals or colonels, who in turn correspond with the chief of the\r\ngendarmes; and the latter, seeing the Emperor every day, reports to him\r\nwhat he finds necessary to report. All functionaries of the empire are\r\nunder gendarme supervision; it is the duty of the generals and colonels\r\nto keep an eye upon the public and private life of every subject of\r\nthe Tsar--even upon the governors of the provinces, the ministers, and\r\nthe grand dukes. The Emperor himself is under their close watch, and\r\nas they are well informed of the petty chronicle of the palace, and\r\nknow every step that the Emperor takes outside his palace, the chief of\r\nthe gendarmes becomes, so to speak, a confidant of the most intimate\r\naffairs of the rulers of Russia.\r\n\r\nAt this period of the reign of Alexander II. the Third Section was\r\nabsolutely all-powerful. The gendarme colonels made searches by the\r\nthousand without troubling themselves in the least about the existence\r\nof laws and law courts in Russia. They arrested whom they liked, kept\r\npeople imprisoned as long as they pleased, and transported hundreds\r\nto North-east Russia or Siberia according to the fancy of general or\r\ncolonel; the signature of the Minister of the Interior was a mere\r\nformality, because he had no control over them and no knowledge of\r\ntheir doings.\r\n\r\nIt was four o’clock in the morning when my examination began. ‘You\r\nare accused,’ I was solemnly told, ‘of having belonged to a secret\r\nsociety which has for its object the overthrow of the existing form of\r\ngovernment, and of conspiracy against the sacred person of his Imperial\r\nMajesty. Are you guilty of this crime?’\r\n\r\n‘Till I am brought before a court where I can speak publicly, I will\r\ngive you no replies whatever.’\r\n\r\n‘Write,’ the procureur dictated to a scribe: ‘“Does not acknowledge\r\nhimself guilty.” Still’ he continued, after a pause, ‘I must ask\r\nyou certain questions. Do you know a person of the name of Nikolái\r\nTchaykóvsky?’\r\n\r\n‘If you persist in your questions, then write “No” to any question\r\nwhatsoever that you are pleased to ask me.’\r\n\r\n‘But if we ask you whether you know, for instance, Mr. Polakóff, whom\r\nyou spoke about a while ago?’\r\n\r\n‘The moment _you_ ask me such a question, don’t hesitate: write “No.”\r\nAnd if you ask me whether I know my brother, or my sister, or my\r\nstepmother, write “No.” You will not receive from me another reply:\r\nbecause if I answered “Yes” with regard to any person, you would at\r\nonce plan some evil against him, making a raid or something worse, and\r\nsaying next that I named him.’\r\n\r\nA long list of questions was read, to which I patiently replied each\r\ntime, ‘Write “No.”’ That lasted for an hour, during which I learned\r\nthat all who had been arrested, with the exception of the two weavers,\r\nhad behaved very well. The weavers knew only that I had twice met a\r\ndozen workers, and the gendarmes knew nothing about our circle.\r\n\r\n‘What are you doing, prince?’ a gendarme officer said, as he took me\r\nto my cell. ‘Your refusal to answer questions will be made a terrible\r\nweapon against you.’\r\n\r\n‘It is my right, is it not?’\r\n\r\n‘Yes, but--you know.... I hope you will find this room comfortable. It\r\nhas been kept warm since your arrest.’\r\n\r\nI found it quite comfortable, and fell sound asleep. I was waked the\r\nnext morning by a gendarme, who brought me the morning tea. He was soon\r\nfollowed by somebody else, who whispered to me in the most unconcerned\r\nway, ‘Here’s a scrap of paper and a pencil: write your letter.’ It\r\nwas a sympathizer, whom I knew by name; he used to transmit our\r\ncorrespondence with the prisoners of the Third Section.\r\n\r\nFrom all sides I heard knocks on the walls, following in rapid\r\nsuccession. It was the prisoners communicating with one another by\r\nmeans of light taps; but, being a new-comer, I could make nothing out\r\nof the noise, which seemed to come from all parts of the building at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne thing worried me. During the search in my house, I overheard the\r\nprocureur whispering to the gendarme officer about going to make a\r\nsearch at the apartment of my friend Polakóff, to whom the letter of\r\nDmítri was addressed. Polakóff was a young student, a very gifted\r\nzoologist and botanist, with whom I had made my Vitím expedition in\r\nSiberia. He was born of a poor Cossack family on the frontier of\r\nMongolia, and, after having surmounted all sorts of difficulties, he\r\nhad come to St. Petersburg, entered the university, where he had won\r\nthe reputation of a most promising zoologist, and was then passing his\r\nfinal examinations. We had been great friends since our long journey,\r\nand had even lived together for a time at St. Petersburg, but he took\r\nno interest in my political activity.\r\n\r\nI spoke of him to the procureur. ‘I give you my word of honour,’ I\r\nsaid, ‘that Polakóff has never taken part in any political affair.\r\nTo-morrow he has to pass an examination, and you will spoil forever the\r\nscientific career of a young man who has gone through great hardships,\r\nand has struggled for years against all sorts of obstacles, to attain\r\nhis present position. I know that you do not much care for it, but\r\nhe is looked upon at the university as one of the future glories of\r\nRussian science.’\r\n\r\nThe search was made, nevertheless, but a respite of three days was\r\ngiven for the examinations. A little later I was called before the\r\nprocureur, who triumphantly showed me an envelope addressed in my\r\nhandwriting, and in it a note, also in my handwriting, which said,\r\n‘Please take this packet to V. E., and ask that it be kept until demand\r\nin due form is made.’ The person to whom the note was addressed was not\r\nmentioned in the note. ‘This letter,’ the procureur said, ‘was found at\r\nMr. Polakóff’s; and now, prince, his fate is in your hands. If you tell\r\nme who V. E. is, Mr. Polakóff will be released; but if you refuse to do\r\nso, he will be kept as long as he does not make up his mind to give us\r\nthe name of that person.’\r\n\r\nLooking at the envelope, which was addressed in black chalk, and\r\nthe letter, which was written in common lead pencil, I immediately\r\nremembered the circumstances under which the two had been written. ‘I\r\nam positive,’ I exclaimed at once, ‘that the note and the envelope\r\nwere not found together! It is _you_ who have put the letter in the\r\nenvelope.’\r\n\r\nThe procureur blushed. ‘Would you have me believe,’ I continued, ‘that\r\nyou, a practical man, did not notice that the two are written in quite\r\ndifferent pencils? And now you are trying to make people think that the\r\ntwo belong to each other! Well, sir, then I tell you that the letter\r\nwas not to Polakóff.’\r\n\r\nHe hesitated for some time, but then, regaining his audacity, he said,\r\n‘Polakóff has admitted that this letter of yours was written to him.’\r\n\r\nNow I knew he was lying. Polakóff would have admitted everything\r\nconcerning himself; but he would have preferred to be marched to\r\nSiberia rather than to involve another person. So, looking straight in\r\nthe face of the procureur, I replied, ‘No, sir, he has _never_ said\r\nthat, and you know perfectly well that your words are not true.’\r\n\r\nHe became furious, or pretended to be so. ‘Well, then,’ he said, ‘if\r\nyou wait here a moment, I will bring you Polakóff’s written statement\r\nto that effect. He is in the next room under examination.’\r\n\r\n‘Ready to wait as long as you like.’\r\n\r\nI sat on a sofa, smoking countless cigarettes. The statement did not\r\ncome, and never came.\r\n\r\nOf course there was no such statement. I met Polakóff in 1878 at\r\nGeneva, whence we made a delightful excursion to the Aletsch glacier.\r\nI need not say that his answers were what I expected them to be: he\r\ndenied having any knowledge of the letter, or of the person the letters\r\nV. E. represented. Scores of books used to be taken from me to him,\r\nand back to me, and the letter was found in a book, while the envelope\r\nwas discovered in the pocket of an old coat. He was kept several weeks\r\nunder arrest, and then released, owing to the intervention of his\r\nscientific friends. V. E. was not molested, and delivered my papers in\r\ndue time.\r\n\r\nLater on, each time I saw the procureur, I teased him with the\r\nquestion: ‘And what about Polakóff’s statement?’\r\n\r\nI was not taken back to my cell, but an hour later the procureur came\r\nin, accompanied by a gendarme officer. ‘Our examination,’ he announced\r\nto me, ‘is now terminated; you will be removed to another place.’\r\n\r\nA four-wheeled cab stood at the gate. I was asked to enter it, and a\r\nstout gendarme officer, of Caucasian origin, sat by my side. I spoke\r\nto him, but he only snored. The cab crossed the Chain Bridge, then\r\npassed the parade grounds and ran along the canals, as if avoiding the\r\nmore frequented thoroughfares. ‘Are we going to the Litóvsky prison?’\r\nI asked the officer, as I knew that many of my comrades were already\r\nthere. He made no reply. The system of absolute silence which was\r\nmaintained toward me for the next two years began in this four-wheeled\r\ncab; but when we went rolling over the Palace Bridge I understood that\r\nI was taken to the fortress of St. Peter and St. Paul.\r\n\r\nI admired the beautiful river, knowing that I should not soon see it\r\nagain. The sun was going down. Thick grey clouds were hanging in the\r\nwest above the Gulf of Finland, while light clouds floated over my\r\nhead, showing here and there patches of blue sky. Then the carriage\r\nturned to the left and entered a dark arched passage, the gate of the\r\nfortress.\r\n\r\n‘Now I shall have to remain here for a couple of years,’ I remarked to\r\nthe officer.\r\n\r\n‘No, why so long?’ replied the Circassian who, now that we were within\r\nthe fortress, had regained the power of speech. ‘Your affair is almost\r\nterminated, and may be brought into court in a fortnight.’\r\n\r\n‘My affair,’ I replied, ‘is very simple; but before bringing me to a\r\ncourt you will try to arrest all the socialists in Russia, and they are\r\nmany, very many; in two years you will not have done.’ I did not then\r\nrealize how prophetic my remark was.\r\n\r\nThe carriage stopped at the door of the military commander of the\r\nfortress, and we entered his reception hall. General Korsákoff, a thin\r\nold man, came in, with a peevish expression on his face. The officer\r\nspoke to him in a subdued voice, and the old man answered, ‘All right,’\r\nlooking at him with a sort of scorn, and then turned his eyes toward\r\nme. It was evident that he was not at all pleased to receive a new\r\ninmate, and that he felt slightly ashamed of his rôle; but he seemed\r\nto add, ‘I am a soldier, and only do my duty.’ Presently we got into\r\nthe carriage again, but soon stopped before another gate, where we were\r\nkept a long time until a detachment of soldiers opened it from the\r\ninside. Proceeding on foot through narrow passages, we came to a third\r\niron gate, opening into a dark arched passage, from which we entered a\r\nsmall room where darkness and dampness prevailed.\r\n\r\nSeveral non-commissioned officers of the fortress troops moved\r\nnoiselessly about in their soft felt boots, without speaking a word,\r\nwhile the governor signed the Circassian’s book acknowledging the\r\nreception of a new prisoner. I was required to take off all my clothes,\r\nand to put on the prison dress--a green flannel dressing-gown, immense\r\nwoollen stockings of an incredible thickness, and boat-shaped yellow\r\nslippers, so big that I could hardly keep them on my feet when I tried\r\nto walk. I always hated dressing-gowns and slippers, and the thick\r\nstockings inspired me with disgust. I had to take off even a silk\r\nundergarment, which in the damp fortress it would have been especially\r\ndesirable to retain, but that could not be allowed. I naturally began\r\nto protest and to make a noise about this, and after an hour or so it\r\nwas restored to me by order of General Korsákoff.\r\n\r\nThen I was taken through a dark passage, where I saw armed sentries\r\nwalking about, and was put into a cell. A heavy oak door was shut\r\nbehind me, a key turned in the lock, and I was alone in a half-dark\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART FIFTH\r\n\r\nTHE FORTRESS--THE ESCAPE\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThis was, then, the terrible fortress where so much of the true\r\nstrength of Russia had perished during the last two centuries, and the\r\nvery name of which is uttered in St. Petersburg in a hushed voice.\r\n\r\nHere Peter I. tortured his son Alexis and killed him with his own hand;\r\nhere the Princess Tarakánova was kept in a cell which filled with water\r\nduring an inundation--the rats climbing upon her to save themselves\r\nfrom drowning; here the terrible Minich tortured his enemies, and\r\nCatherine II. buried alive those who objected to her having murdered\r\nher husband. And from the times of Peter I., for a hundred and seventy\r\nyears, the annals of this mass of stone which rises from the Nevá in\r\nfront of the Winter Palace were annals of murder and torture, of men\r\nburied alive, condemned to a slow death, or driven to insanity in the\r\nloneliness of the dark and damp dungeons.\r\n\r\nHere the Decembrists, who were the first to unfurl in Russia the banner\r\nof republican rule and the abolition of serfdom, underwent their\r\nfirst experiences of martyrdom, and traces of them may still be found\r\nin the Russian Bastille. Here were imprisoned the poets Ryléeff and\r\nShevchénko, Dostoévsky, Bakúnin, Chernyshévsky, Písareff, and so many\r\nothers of our best contemporary writers. Here Karakózoff was tortured\r\nand hanged.\r\n\r\nHere, somewhere in the Alexis ravelin, was still kept Necháieff, who\r\nwas given up to Russia by Switzerland as a common-law criminal, but was\r\ntreated as a dangerous political prisoner, and would never again see\r\nthe light. In the same ravelin were also two or three men whom, rumour\r\nsaid, Alexander II., because of what they knew, and what others must\r\nnot know, about some palace mystery, ordered to be imprisoned for life.\r\nOne of them, adorned with a long grey beard, was lately seen by an\r\nacquaintance of mine in the mysterious fortress.\r\n\r\nAll these shadows rose before my imagination. But my thoughts fixed\r\nespecially on Bakúnin, who, though he had been shut up in an Austrian\r\nfortress, after 1848, for two years chained to the wall, and then\r\nwas handed over to Nicholas I. who kept him in this fortress for six\r\nyears longer, came out, when the Iron Tsar’s death released him after\r\nan eight years’ imprisonment, fresher and fuller of vigour than his\r\ncomrades who had remained at liberty. ‘He has lived it through,’ I said\r\nto myself, ‘and I must, too; I will _not_ succumb here!’\r\n\r\nMy first movement was to approach the window, which was placed so\r\nhigh that I could hardly reach it with my lifted hand. It was a long,\r\nlow opening, cut in a wall five feet thick, and protected by an iron\r\ngrating and a double iron window-frame. At a distance of a dozen yards\r\nfrom this window I saw the outer wall of the fortress, of immense\r\nthickness, on the top of which I could make out a grey sentry-box. Only\r\nby looking upward could I perceive a bit of the sky.\r\n\r\nI made a minute inspection of the room where I had now to spend no one\r\ncould say how many years. From the position of the high chimney of the\r\nMint I guessed that I was in the south-western corner of the fortress,\r\nin a bastion overlooking the Nevá. The building in which I was\r\nincarcerated, however, was not the bastion itself, but what is called\r\nin a fortification a _reduit_; that is, an inner two-storied pentagonal\r\npiece of masonry which rises a little higher than the walls of the\r\nbastion, and is meant to contain two tiers of guns. This room of mine\r\nwas a casemate destined for a big gun, and the window was an embrasure.\r\nThe rays of the sun could never penetrate it; even in summer they are\r\nlost in the thickness of the wall. The room held an iron bed, a small\r\noak table, and an oak stool. The floor was covered with painted felt,\r\nand the walls with yellow paper. However, in order to deaden sounds,\r\nthe paper was not put on the wall itself; it was pasted upon canvas,\r\nand behind the canvas I discovered a wire grating, back of which was a\r\nlayer of felt; only beyond the felt could I reach the stone wall. At\r\nthe inner side of the room there was a washstand, and a thick oak door\r\nin which I made out a locked opening, for passing food through, and\r\na little slit protected by glass and by a shutter from the outside:\r\nthis was the ‘Judas,’ through which the prisoner could be spied upon\r\nat every moment. The sentry who stood in the passage frequently lifted\r\nthe shutter and looked inside--his boots squeaking as he crept toward\r\nthe door. I tried to speak to him; then the eye which I could see\r\nthrough the slit assumed an expression of terror, and the shutter was\r\nimmediately let down, only to be furtively opened a minute or two\r\nlater; but I could not get a word of response from the sentry.\r\n\r\nAbsolute silence reigned all round. I dragged my stool to the window\r\nand looked upon the little bit of sky that I could see; I tried to\r\ncatch some sound from the Nevá, or from the town on the opposite side\r\nof the river; but I could not. This dead silence began to oppress me,\r\nand I tried to sing, slowly at first, and louder and louder afterwards.\r\n\r\n‘Have I then to say farewell to love for ever’--I caught myself singing\r\nfrom my favourite opera of Glinka, ‘Ruslán and Ludmíla.’\r\n\r\n‘Sir, do not sing, please,’ a bass voice resounded through the\r\nfood-window in my door.\r\n\r\n‘I _will_ sing, and I shall.’\r\n\r\n‘You may not.’\r\n\r\n‘I will sing nevertheless.’\r\n\r\nThen came the governor, who tried to persuade me that I must not sing,\r\nas it would have to be reported to the commander of the fortress, and\r\nso on.\r\n\r\n‘But my throat will become blocked and my lungs become useless if I do\r\nnot speak and cannot sing,’ I tried to argue.\r\n\r\n‘You had better try to sing in a lower tone, more or less to yourself,’\r\nsaid the old governor in a supplicatory manner.\r\n\r\nBut all this was useless. A few days later I had lost all desire to\r\nsing. I tried to do it on principle, but it was of no avail.\r\n\r\n‘The main thing,’ I said to myself, ‘is to preserve my physical vigour.\r\nI _will_ not fall ill. Let me imagine myself compelled to spend a\r\ncouple of years in a hut in the far north, during an arctic expedition.\r\nI will take plenty of exercise, practise gymnastics, and not let\r\nmyself be broken down by my surroundings. Ten steps from one corner\r\nto the other is already something. If I repeat them one hundred and\r\nfifty times, I shall have walked one verst’ (two-thirds of a mile). I\r\ndetermined to walk every day seven versts--about five miles: two versts\r\nin the morning, two before dinner, two after dinner, and one before\r\ngoing to sleep. ‘If I put on the table ten cigarettes, and move one of\r\nthem each time that I pass the table, I shall easily count the three\r\nhundred times that I must walk up and down. I must walk rapidly, but\r\nturn slowly in the corner to avoid becoming giddy, and turn each time\r\na different way. Then twice a day I shall practise gymnastics with my\r\nheavy stool.’ I lifted it by one leg, holding it at arm’s length. I\r\nturned it like a wheel, and soon learned to throw it from one hand to\r\nthe other, over my head, behind my back, and across my legs.\r\n\r\nA few hours after I had been brought into the prison the governor came\r\nto offer me some books, and among them was an old acquaintance and\r\nfriend of mine, the first volume of George Lewes’s ‘Physiology,’ in a\r\nRussian translation; but the second volume, which I especially wanted\r\nto read again, was missing. I asked, of course, to have paper, pen,\r\nand ink, but was absolutely refused. Pen and ink are never allowed in\r\nthe fortress, unless special permission is obtained from the Emperor\r\nhimself. I suffered very much from this forced inactivity, and began\r\nto compose in my imagination a series of novels for popular reading,\r\ntaken from Russian history--something like Eugène Sue’s ‘Mystères du\r\nPeuple.’ I made up the plot, the descriptions, the dialogues, and tried\r\nto commit the whole to memory from the beginning to the end. One can\r\neasily imagine how exhausting such a work would have been if I had had\r\nto continue it for more than two or three months.\r\n\r\nBut my brother Alexander obtained pen and ink for me. One day I was\r\nasked to enter a four-wheeled cab, in company with the same speechless\r\nGeorgian gendarme officer of whom I have spoken before. I was taken to\r\nthe Third Section, where I was allowed an interview with my brother, in\r\nthe presence of two gendarme officers.\r\n\r\nAlexander was at Zürich when I was arrested. From early youth he had\r\nlonged to go abroad, where men think as they like, read what they\r\nlike, and openly express their thoughts. Russian life was hateful to\r\nhim. Veracity--absolute veracity--and the most open-hearted frankness\r\nwere the dominating features of his character; he could not bear\r\ndeceit or even conceit in any form. The absence of free speech in\r\nRussia, the Russian readiness to submit to oppression, the veiled\r\nwords to which our writers resort, were utterly repulsive to his\r\nfrank and open nature. Soon after my return from Western Europe he\r\nremoved to Switzerland, and decided to settle there. After he had lost\r\nhis two children--one from cholera in a few hours, and another from\r\nconsumption--St. Petersburg became doubly repugnant to him.\r\n\r\nMy brother did not take part in our work of agitation. He did not\r\nbelieve in the possibility of a popular uprising, and he conceived\r\na revolution only as the action of a representative body, like the\r\nNational Assembly of France in 1789. As for the socialist agitation, he\r\nunderstood it when it is conducted by means of public meetings--not as\r\nthe secret, minute work of personal propaganda which we were carrying\r\non. In England he would have sided with John Bright or with the\r\nChartists. If he had been in Paris during the uprising of June 1848, he\r\nwould surely have fought with the last handful of workers behind the\r\nlast barricade; but in the preparatory period he would have followed\r\nLouis Blanc or Ledru Rollin.\r\n\r\nIn Switzerland he settled at Zürich, and his sympathies went with the\r\nmoderate wing of the International. Socialist on principle, he carried\r\nout his principles in his most frugal and laborious mode of living,\r\ntoiling on passionately at his great scientific work--the main purpose\r\nof his life--a work which was to be a nineteenth-century counter-part\r\nto the famous _Tableau de la Nature_ of the Encyclopædists. He\r\nsoon became a close personal friend of the old refugee, Colonel P.\r\nL. Lavróff, with whom he had very much in common in his Kantian\r\nphilosophical views.\r\n\r\nWhen he learned about my arrest, Alexander immediately left\r\neverything--the work of his life, the life itself of freedom which was\r\nas necessary for him as free air is necessary for a bird--and returned\r\nto St. Petersburg, which he disliked, only to help me through my\r\nimprisonment.\r\n\r\nWe were both very much affected at this interview. My brother was\r\nextremely excited. He hated the very sight of the blue uniforms of the\r\ngendarmes--those executioners of all independent thought in Russia--and\r\nexpressed his feeling frankly in their presence. As for me, the sight\r\nof him at St. Petersburg filled me with the most dismal apprehensions.\r\nI was happy to see his honest face, his eyes full of love, and to hear\r\nthat I should see them once a month; and yet I wished him hundreds of\r\nmiles away from that place to which he came free that day, but to which\r\nhe would inevitably be brought some night under an escort of gendarmes.\r\n‘Why did you come into the lion’s den? Go back at once!’ my whole inner\r\nself cried; and yet I knew that he would remain as long as I was in\r\nprison.\r\n\r\nHe understood better than any one else that inactivity would kill me,\r\nand had already made application to obtain for me the permission of\r\nresuming work. The Geographical Society wanted me to finish my book on\r\nthe glacial period, and my brother turned the whole scientific world\r\nin St. Petersburg upside down to move it to support his application.\r\nThe Academy of Sciences was interested in the matter; and finally, two\r\nor three months after my imprisonment, the governor entered my cell\r\nand announced to me that I was permitted by the Emperor to complete\r\nmy report to the Geographical Society, and that I should be allowed\r\npen and ink for that purpose. ‘Till sunset only,’ he added. Sunset, at\r\nSt. Petersburg, is at three in the afternoon, in winter time; but that\r\ncould not be helped. ‘Till sunset’ were the words used by Alexander II.\r\nwhen he granted the permission.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nSo I could work!\r\n\r\nI could hardly express now the immensity of relief I then felt at being\r\nenabled to resume writing. I would have consented to live on nothing\r\nbut bread and water, in the dampest of cellars, if only permitted to\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nI was, however, the sole prisoner to whom writing materials were\r\nallowed. Several of my comrades spent three years and more in\r\nconfinement before the famous trial of ‘the hundred and ninety-three’\r\ntook place, and all they had was a slate. Of course, even the\r\nslate was welcome in that dreary loneliness, and they used it to\r\nwrite exercises in the languages they were learning, or to work out\r\nmathematical problems; but what was jotted down on the slate could last\r\nonly a few hours.\r\n\r\nMy prison life now took a more regular character. There was something\r\nimmediate to live for. At nine in the morning I had already made\r\nthe first three hundred pacings across my cell, and was waiting for\r\nmy pencils and pens to be delivered to me. The work which I had\r\nprepared for the Geographical Society contained, beside a report of\r\nmy explorations in Finland, a discussion of the bases upon which the\r\nglacial hypothesis ought to rest. Now, knowing that I had plenty of\r\ntime before me, I decided to rewrite and enlarge that part of my work.\r\nThe Academy of Sciences put its admirable library at my service, and\r\na corner of my cell soon filled up with books and maps, including the\r\nwhole of the excellent Swedish Geological Survey publications, a nearly\r\nfull collection of reports of all Arctic travels, and whole sets of\r\nthe _Quarterly Journal of the London Geological Society_. My book grew\r\nin the fortress to the size of two large volumes. The first of them\r\nwas printed by my brother and Polakóff (in the Geographical Society’s\r\nMemoirs); while the second, not quite finished, remained in the hands\r\nof the Third Section when I ran away. The manuscript was only found in\r\n1895, and given to the Russian Geographical Society, by whom it was\r\nforwarded to me in London.\r\n\r\nAt five in the afternoon--at three in the winter--as soon as the\r\ntiny lamp was brought in, my pencils and pens were taken away, and\r\nI had to stop work. Then I used to read, mostly books of history.\r\nQuite a library had been formed in the fortress by the generations of\r\npolitical prisoners who had been confined there. I was allowed to add\r\nto the library a number of staple works on Russian history, and with\r\nthe books which were brought to me by my relatives I was enabled to\r\nread almost every work and collection of acts and documents bearing\r\non the Moscow period of the history of Russia. I relished in reading,\r\nnot only the Russian annals, especially the admirable annals of the\r\ndemocratic mediæval republic of Pskov--the best, perhaps, in Europe\r\nfor the history of that type of mediæval cities--but all sorts of dry\r\ndocuments, and even the Lives of the Saints, which occasionally contain\r\nfacts of the real life of the masses which cannot be found elsewhere. I\r\nalso read during this time a great number of novels, and even arranged\r\nfor myself a treat on Christmas Eve. My relatives managed to send\r\nme then the Christmas stories of Dickens, and I spent the festival\r\nlaughing and crying over those beautiful creations of the great\r\nnovelist.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe worst was the silence, as of the grave, which reigned about me.\r\nIn vain I knocked on the walls and struck the floor with my foot,\r\nlistening for the faintest sound in reply. None was to be heard.\r\nOne month passed, then two, three, fifteen months, but there was no\r\nreply to my knocks. We were only six, scattered among thirty-six\r\ncasemates--all my arrested comrades being kept in the Litóvskiy Zámok\r\nprison. When the non-commissioned officer entered my cell to take me\r\nout for a walk, and I asked him, ‘What kind of weather have we? Does\r\nit rain?’ he cast a furtive side glance at me, and without saying a\r\nword promptly retired behind the door, where a sentry and another\r\nnon-commissioned officer kept watch upon him. The only living being\r\nfrom whom I could hear even a few words was the governor, who came to\r\nmy cell every morning to say ‘good-morning’ and ask whether I wanted to\r\nbuy tobacco or paper. I tried to engage him in conversation; but he\r\nalso cast furtive glances at the non-commissioned officers who stood\r\nin the half-opened door, as if to say, ‘You see, I am watched, too.’\r\nPigeons only were not afraid to keep intercourse with me. Every morning\r\nand every afternoon they came to my window to receive through the\r\ngratings their food.\r\n\r\nThere were no sounds whatever except the squeak of the sentry’s boots,\r\nthe hardly perceptible noise of the shutter of the Judas, and the\r\nringing of the bells on the fortress cathedral. They rang a ‘Lord save\r\nme’ (‘Góspodi pomílui’) every quarter of an hour--one, two, three,\r\nfour times. Then, each hour, the big bell struck slowly, with long\r\nintervals between successive strokes. A lugubrious canticle followed,\r\nchimed by the bells, which at every sudden change of temperature went\r\nout of tune, making at such times a horrible cacophony which sounded\r\nlike the ringing of bells at a burial. At the gloomy hour of midnight,\r\nthe canticle, moreover, was followed by the discordant notes of a ‘God\r\nsave the Tsar.’ The ringing lasted a full quarter of an hour; and no\r\nsooner had it come to an end than a new ‘Lord save me’ announced to the\r\nsleepless prisoner that a quarter of an hour of his uselessly spent\r\nlife had gone in the meantime, and that many quarters of an hour, and\r\nhours, and days, and months of the same vegetative life would pass,\r\nbefore his keepers, or, maybe, death, would release him.\r\n\r\nEvery morning I was taken out for a half-hour’s walk in the prison\r\nyard. This yard was a small pentagon with a narrow pavement round it,\r\nand a little building--the bath house--in the middle. But I liked those\r\nwalks.\r\n\r\nThe need of new impressions is so great in prison that, when I\r\nwalked in our narrow yard, I always kept my eyes fixed upon the\r\nhigh gilt spire of the fortress cathedral. This was the only thing\r\nin my surroundings which changed its aspect, and I liked to see it\r\nglittering like pure gold when the sun shone from a clear blue sky, or\r\nassuming a fairy aspect when a light bluish haze lay upon the town, or\r\nbecoming steel gray when dark clouds began to gather.\r\n\r\nDuring these walks, I saw occasionally the daughter of our governor,\r\na girl of eighteen, as she came out from her father’s apartment and\r\nhad to walk a few steps in our yard in order to reach the entrance\r\ngate--the only issue from the building. She always hurried to pass\r\naway, with her eyes cast down, as if she felt ashamed of being the\r\ndaughter of a jailor. Her younger brother, on the contrary, a cadet\r\nwhom I also saw once or twice in the yard, always looked straight in my\r\nface with such a frank expression of sympathy that I was struck by it,\r\nand even mentioned it to some one after my release. Four or five years\r\nlater, when he was already an officer, he was exiled to Siberia. He had\r\njoined the revolutionary party, and must have helped, I suppose, to\r\ncarry on correspondence with prisoners in the fortress.\r\n\r\nWinter is gloomy at St. Petersburg for those who cannot be out in\r\nthe brightly lighted streets. It was still gloomier, of course, in a\r\ncasemate. But dampness was even worse than darkness. In order to drive\r\naway moisture the casemate was overheated, and I could not breathe; but\r\nwhen, at last, I obtained by request, that the temperature should be\r\nkept lower than before, the outer wall became dripping with moisture,\r\nand the paper was as if a pail of water had been poured upon it every\r\nday--the consequence being that I suffered a great deal from rheumatism.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith all that I was cheerful, continuing to write and to draw maps in\r\nthe darkness, sharpening my lead pencils with a broken piece of glass\r\nwhich I had managed to get hold of in the yard; I faithfully walked my\r\nfive miles a day in the cell, and performed gymnastic feats with my oak\r\nstool. Time went on. But then sorrow crept into my cell and nearly\r\nbroke me down. My brother Alexander was arrested.\r\n\r\nToward the end of December 1874, I was allowed an interview with him\r\nand our sister Hélène, in the fortress, in the presence of a gendarme\r\nofficer. Interviews, granted at long intervals, always bring both the\r\nprisoner and his relatives into a state of excitement. One sees beloved\r\nfaces and hears beloved voices, knowing that the vision will last but\r\na few moments; one feels so near to the other, and yet so far off, as\r\nthere can be no intimate conversation before a stranger, an enemy and\r\na spy. Besides, my brother and sister felt anxious for my health, upon\r\nwhich the dark, gloomy winter days and the dampness had already marked\r\ntheir first effects. We parted with heavy hearts.\r\n\r\nA week after that interview, I received, instead of an expected letter\r\nfrom my brother concerning the printing of my book, a short note from\r\nPolakóff. He informed me that henceforward he would read the proofs,\r\nand that I should have to address to him everything relative to the\r\nprinting. From the very tone of the note I understood at once that\r\nsomething must be wrong with my brother. If it were only illness,\r\nPolakóff would have mentioned it. Days of fearful anxiety came upon\r\nme. Alexander must have been arrested, and I must have been the cause\r\nof it! Life suddenly ceased to have any meaning for me. My walks, my\r\ngymnastics, my work, lost interest. All the day long I went ceaselessly\r\nup and down my cell, thinking of nothing but Alexander’s arrest. For\r\nme, an unmarried man, imprisonment was only personal inconvenience; but\r\nhe was married, he passionately loved his wife, and they now had a boy,\r\nupon whom they had concentrated all the love that they had felt for\r\ntheir first two children.\r\n\r\nWorst of all was the incertitude. What could he have done? For what\r\nreason had he been arrested? What were they going to do with him? Weeks\r\npassed; my anxiety became deeper and deeper; but there was no news,\r\ntill at last I heard in a roundabout way that he had been arrested for\r\na letter written to P. L. Lavróff.\r\n\r\nI learned the details much later. After his last interview with me\r\nhe wrote to his old friend, who at that time was editing a Russian\r\nsocialist review, _Forward_, in London. He mentioned in this letter his\r\nfears about my health; he spoke of the many arrests which were made\r\nthen in Russia; and he freely expressed his hatred of the despotic\r\nrule. The letter was intercepted at the post office by the Third\r\nSection, and they came on Christmas Eve to search his apartments. They\r\ncarried out their search in an even more brutal manner than usual.\r\nAfter midnight half a dozen men made an irruption into his flat, and\r\nturned everything upside down. The very walls were examined; the sick\r\nchild was taken out of its bed, that the bedding and the mattresses\r\nmight be inspected. They found nothing--there was nothing to find.\r\n\r\nMy brother very much resented this search. With his customary\r\nfrankness, he said to the gendarme officer who conducted it: ‘Against\r\nyou, captain, I have no grievance. You have received little education,\r\nand you hardly understand what you are doing. But you, sir,’ he\r\ncontinued, turning toward the procureur, ‘you know what part you are\r\nplaying in these proceedings. You have received a university education.\r\nYou know the law, and you know that you are trampling all law, such as\r\nit is, under your feet, and covering the lawlessness of these men by\r\nyour presence; you are simply--a scoundrel!’\r\n\r\nThey swore hatred against him. They kept him imprisoned in the Third\r\nSection till May. My brother’s child--a charming boy, whom illness\r\nhad rendered still more affectionate and intelligent--was dying from\r\nconsumption. The doctors said he had only a few days more to live.\r\nAlexander, who had never asked any favour of his enemies, asked them\r\nthis time to permit him to see his child for the last time. He begged\r\nto be allowed to go home for one hour, upon his word of honour to\r\nreturn, or to be taken there under escort. They refused. They could not\r\ndeny themselves that vengeance.\r\n\r\nThe child died, and its mother was thrown once more into a state\r\nbordering on insanity when my brother was told that he was to be\r\ntransported to East Siberia, to a small town, Minusínsk. He would\r\ntravel in a cart between two gendarmes, and his wife might follow\r\nlater, but could not travel with him.\r\n\r\n‘Tell me, at least, what is my crime,’ he demanded; but there was\r\nno accusation of any sort against him beyond the letter. This\r\ntransportation appeared so arbitrary, so much an act of mere revenge\r\non the part of the Third Section, that none of our relatives could\r\nbelieve that the exile would last more than a few months. My brother\r\nlodged a complaint with the Minister of the Interior. The reply was\r\nthat the minister could not interfere with the will of the chief of the\r\ngendarmes. Another complaint was lodged with the Senate. It was of no\r\navail.\r\n\r\nA couple of years later, our sister Hélène, acting on her own\r\ninitiative, wrote a petition to the Tsar. Our cousin Dmítri,\r\nGovernor-general of Khárkoff, aide-de-camp of the Emperor and a\r\nfavourite at the court, also deeply incensed at this treatment by the\r\nThird Section, handed the petition personally to the Tsar, and in so\r\ndoing added a few words in support of it. But the vindictiveness of\r\nthe Románoffs was a family trait strongly developed in Alexander II.\r\nHe wrote upon the petition, ‘Pust posidít’ (Let him remain some time\r\nmore). My brother stayed in Siberia twelve years, and never returned to\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe countless arrests which were made in the summer of 1874, and the\r\nserious turn which was given by the police to the prosecution of our\r\ncircle, produced a deep change in the opinions of Russian youth. Up to\r\nthat time the prevailing idea had been to pick out among the workers,\r\nand eventually the peasants, a number of men who should be prepared to\r\nbecome socialistic agitators. But the factories were now flooded with\r\nspies, and it was evident that, do what they might, both propagandists\r\nand workers would very soon be arrested and hidden for ever in Siberia.\r\nThen began a great movement ‘to the people’ in a new form, when several\r\nhundred young men and women, disregarding all precautions hitherto\r\ntaken, rushed to the country, and, travelling through the towns and\r\nvillages, incited the masses to revolution, almost openly distributing\r\npamphlets, songs, and proclamations. In our circles this summer\r\nreceived the name of ‘the mad summer.’\r\n\r\nThe gendarmes lost their heads. They had not hands enough to make the\r\narrests nor eyes enough to trace the steps of every propagandist. Yet\r\nnot less than fifteen hundred persons were arrested during this hunt,\r\nand half of them were kept in prison for years.\r\n\r\nOne day in the summer of 1875, in the cell that was next to mine I\r\ndistinctly heard the light steps of heeled boots, and a few minutes\r\nlater I caught fragments of a conversation. A feminine voice spoke from\r\nthe cell, and a deep bass voice--evidently that of the sentry--grunted\r\nsomething in reply. Then I recognized the sound of the colonel’s spurs,\r\nhis rapid steps, his swearing at the sentry, and the click of the key\r\nin the lock. He said something, and a feminine voice loudly replied:\r\n‘We did not talk. I only asked him to call the non-commissioned\r\nofficer.’ Then the door was locked, and I heard the colonel swearing in\r\nwhispers at the sentry.\r\n\r\nSo I was alone no more. I had a lady neighbour, who at once broke down\r\nthe severe discipline which had hitherto reigned amongst the soldiers.\r\nFrom that day the walls of the fortress, which had been mute during the\r\nlast fifteen months, became animated. From all sides I heard knocks\r\nwith the foot on the floor: one, two, three, four, ... eleven knocks;\r\ntwenty-four knocks, fifteen knocks; then an interruption, followed by\r\nthree knocks and a long succession of thirty-three knocks. Over and\r\nover again these knocks were repeated in the same succession, until\r\nthe neighbour would guess at last that they were meant for ‘Kto vy?’\r\n(Who are you?), the letter _v_ being the third letter in our alphabet.\r\nThereupon conversation was soon established, and usually was conducted\r\nin the abridged alphabet; that is, the alphabet being divided into six\r\nrows of five letters, each letter is marked by its row and its place in\r\nthe row.\r\n\r\nI discovered with great pleasure that I had at my left my friend\r\nSerdukóff, with whom I could soon talk about everything, especially\r\nwhen we used our cipher. But intercourse with men brought its\r\nsufferings as well as its joys. Underneath me was lodged a peasant,\r\nwhom Serdukóff knew. He talked to him by means of knocks; and even\r\nagainst my will, often unconsciously during my work, I followed their\r\nconversations. I also spoke to him. Now, if solitary confinement\r\nwithout any sort of work is hard for educated men, it is infinitely\r\nharder for a peasant who is accustomed to physical work, and not at\r\nall wont to spend years in reading. Our peasant friend felt quite\r\nmiserable, and having been kept for nearly two years in another\r\nprison before he was brought to the fortress--his crime was that he\r\nhad listened to socialists--he was already broken down. Soon I began\r\nto notice, to my terror, that from time to time his mind wandered.\r\nGradually his thoughts grew more and more confused, and we two\r\nperceived, step by step, day by day, evidences that his reason was\r\nfailing, until his talk became at last that of a lunatic. Frightful\r\nnoises and wild cries came next from the lower story; our neighbour was\r\nmad, but was still kept for several months in the casemate before he\r\nwas removed to an asylum, from which he never emerged. To witness the\r\ndestruction of a man’s mind, under such conditions, was terrible. I\r\nam sure it must have contributed to increase the nervous irritability\r\nof my good and true friend Serdukóff. When, after four years’\r\nimprisonment, he was acquitted by the court and released, he shot\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne day I received a quite unexpected visit. The Grand Duke Nicholas,\r\nbrother of Alexander II., who was inspecting the fortress, entered\r\nmy cell, followed only by his aide-de-camp. The door was shut behind\r\nhim. He rapidly approached me, saying, ‘Good-day, Kropótkin.’ He knew\r\nme personally, and spoke in a familiar, good-natured tone, as to an\r\nold acquaintance. ‘How is it possible, Kropótkin, that you, a page de\r\nchambre, a sergeant of the corps of pages, should be mixed up in this\r\nbusiness, and now be here in this horrible casemate?’\r\n\r\n‘Every one has his own opinions,’ was my reply.\r\n\r\n‘Opinions! So your opinions were that you must stir up a revolution?’\r\n\r\nWhat was I to reply? Yes? Then the construction which would be put\r\nupon my answer would be that I, who had refused to give any answers to\r\nthe gendarmes, ‘avowed everything’ before the brother of the Tsar. His\r\ntone was that of a commander of a military school when trying to obtain\r\n‘avowals’ from a cadet. Yet I could not say ‘No’: it would have been a\r\nlie. I did not know what to say, and stood without saying anything.\r\n\r\n‘You see! You feel ashamed of it now’--\r\n\r\nThis remark angered me, and I at once said in a rather sharp way, ‘I\r\nhave given my replies to the examining magistrate, and have nothing\r\nmore to add.’\r\n\r\n‘But understand, Kropótkin, please,’ he said then in the most familiar\r\ntone, ‘that I don’t speak to you as an examining magistrate. I speak\r\nquite as a private person--quite as a private man,’ he repeated,\r\nlowering his voice.\r\n\r\nThoughts went whirling in my head. To play the part of Marquis Posa?\r\nTo tell the emperor through the grand duke of the desolation of\r\nRussia, the ruin of the peasantry, the arbitrariness of the officials,\r\nthe terrible famines in prospect? To say that we wanted to help the\r\npeasants out of their desperate condition, to make them raise their\r\nheads--and by all this try to influence Alexander II.? These thoughts\r\nfollowed one another in rapid succession, till at last I said to\r\nmyself: ‘Never! Nonsense! They know all that. They are enemies of the\r\nnation, and such talk would not change them.’\r\n\r\nI replied that he always remained an official person, and that I could\r\nnot look upon him as a private man.\r\n\r\nHe then began to ask me indifferent questions. ‘Was it not in Siberia,\r\nwith the Decembrists, that you began to entertain such ideas?’\r\n\r\n‘No; I knew only one Decembrist, and with him I had no conversation\r\nworth speaking of.’\r\n\r\n‘Was it then at St. Petersburg that you got them?’\r\n\r\n‘I was always the same.’\r\n\r\n‘Why! Were you such in the corps of pages?’ he asked me with terror.\r\n\r\n‘In the corps I was a boy, and what is indefinite in boyhood grows\r\ndefinite in manhood.’\r\n\r\nHe asked me some other similar questions, and as he spoke I distinctly\r\nsaw what he was driving at. He was trying to obtain avowals, and my\r\nimagination vividly pictured him saying to his brother: ‘All these\r\nexamining magistrates are imbeciles. He gave them no replies, but I\r\ntalked to him ten minutes, and he told me everything.’ That began to\r\nannoy me; and when he said to me something to this effect, ‘How could\r\nyou have anything to do with all these people--peasants and people\r\nwith no names?’--I sharply turned upon him and said, ‘I have told you\r\nalready that I have given my replies to the examining magistrate.’ Then\r\nhe abruptly left the cell.\r\n\r\nLater, the soldiers of the guard made quite a legend of that visit.\r\nThe person who came in a carriage to carry me away at the time of my\r\nescape wore a military cap, and, having sandy whiskers, bore a faint\r\nresemblance to the Grand Duke Nicholas. So a tradition grew up amongst\r\nthe soldiers of the St. Petersburg garrison that it was the grand\r\nduke himself who came to rescue me and kidnapped me. Thus are legends\r\ncreated even in times of newspapers and biographical dictionaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTwo years had passed. Several of my comrades had died, several had\r\nbecome insane, but nothing was heard yet of our case coming before a\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nMy health gave way before the end of the second year. The oak stool now\r\nseemed heavy in my hand, and the five miles became an endless distance.\r\nAs there were about sixty of us in the fortress, and the winter days\r\nwere short, we were taken out for a walk in the yard for twenty minutes\r\nonly every third day. I did my best to maintain my energy, but the\r\n‘arctic wintering’ without an interruption in the summer got the better\r\nof me. I had brought back from my Siberian journeys slight symptoms\r\nof scurvy; now, in the darkness and dampness of the casemate, they\r\ndeveloped more distinctly; that scourge of the prisons had got hold of\r\nme.\r\n\r\nIn March or April 1876, we were at last told that the Third Section had\r\ncompleted the preliminary inquest. The ‘case’ had been transmitted to\r\nthe judicial authorities, and consequently we were removed to a prison\r\nattached to the court of justice--the House of Detention.\r\n\r\nIt was an immense show prison, recently built on the model of the\r\nFrench and Belgian prisons, consisting of four stories of small cells,\r\neach of which had a window overlooking an inner yard and a door opening\r\non an iron balcony; the balconies of the several stories were connected\r\nby iron staircases.\r\n\r\nFor most of my comrades the transfer to this prison was a great relief.\r\nThere was much more life in it than in the fortress; more opportunity\r\nfor correspondence, for seeing one’s relatives, and for mutual\r\nintercourse. Tapping on the walls continued all day long undisturbed,\r\nand I was able in this way to relate to a young neighbour the history\r\nof the Paris Commune from the beginning to the end. It took, however, a\r\nwhole week’s tapping.\r\n\r\nAs to my health, it grew even worse than it had lately been in the\r\nfortress. I could not bear the close atmosphere of the tiny cell, which\r\nmeasured only four steps from one corner to another, and where, as soon\r\nas the steam-pipes were set to work, the temperature changed from a\r\nglacial cold to an unbearable heat. Having to turn so often, I became\r\ngiddy after a few minutes’ walk, and ten minutes of outdoor exercise,\r\nin the corner of a yard inclosed between high brick walls, did not\r\nrefresh me in the least. As to the prison doctor, who did not want to\r\nhear the word ‘scurvy’ pronounced ‘in his prison,’ the less said of him\r\nthe better.\r\n\r\nI was allowed to receive food from home, it so happening that one of my\r\nrelatives, married to a lawyer, lived a few doors from the court. But\r\nmy digestion had become so bad that I was soon able to eat nothing but\r\na small piece of bread and one or two eggs a day. My strength rapidly\r\nfailed, and the general opinion was that I should not live more than\r\na few months. When climbing the staircase which led to my cell in the\r\nsecond story, I had to stop two or three times to rest, and I remember\r\nan elderly soldier from the escort once commiserating me and saying,\r\n‘Poor man, you won’t live till the end of the summer.’\r\n\r\nMy relatives now became very much alarmed. My sister Hélène tried to\r\nobtain my release on bail, but the procureur, Shúbin, replied to her,\r\nwith a sardonic smile, ‘If you bring me a doctor’s certificate that he\r\nwill die in ten days, I will release him.’ He had the satisfaction of\r\nseeing my sister fall into a chair and sob aloud in his presence. She\r\nsucceeded, however, in gaining her request that I should be visited by\r\na good physician--the chief doctor of the military hospital of the St.\r\nPetersburg garrison. He was a bright, intelligent, aged general, who\r\nexamined me in the most scrupulous manner, and concluded that I had no\r\norganic disease, but was suffering simply from a want of oxidation of\r\nthe blood. ‘Air is all that you want,’ he said. Then he stood a few\r\nminutes in hesitation, and added in a decided manner, ‘No use talking,\r\nyou cannot remain here; you must be transferred.’\r\n\r\nSome ten days later I was transferred to the military hospital, which\r\nis situated on the outskirts of St. Petersburg, and has a special small\r\nprison for the officers and soldiers who fall ill when they are under\r\ntrial. Two of my comrades had already been removed to this hospital\r\nprison, when it was certain that they would soon die of consumption.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the hospital I began at once to recover. I was given a spacious\r\nroom on the ground floor, close by the room of the military guard. It\r\nhad an immense grated window looking south, which opened on a small\r\nboulevard with two rows of trees; and beyond the boulevard there was a\r\nwide space where two hundred carpenters were engaged in building wooden\r\nshanties for typhoid patients. Every evening they gave an hour or so to\r\nsinging in chorus--such a chorus as is formed only in large carpenters’\r\n_artéls_. A sentry marched up and down the boulevard, his box standing\r\nopposite my room.\r\n\r\nMy window was kept open all the day, and I basked in the rays of the\r\nsun, which I had missed for such a long time. I breathed the balmy\r\nair of May with a full chest, and my health improved rapidly--too\r\nrapidly, I began to think. I was soon able to digest light food, gained\r\nstrength, and resumed my work with renewed energy. Seeing no way how I\r\ncould finish the second volume of my work, I wrote a _résumé_ of it,\r\nwhich was printed in the first volume.\r\n\r\nIn the fortress I had heard from a comrade who had been in the hospital\r\nprison that it would not be hard for me to escape from it, and I made\r\nmy presence there known to my friends. However, escape proved far more\r\ndifficult than I had been led to believe. A stricter supervision than\r\nhad ever before been heard of was exercised over me. The sentry in the\r\npassage was placed at my door, and I was never let out of my room.\r\nThe hospital soldiers and the officers of the guard who occasionally\r\nentered it seemed to be afraid to stay more than a minute or two.\r\n\r\nVarious plans were made by my friends to liberate me--some of them\r\nvery amusing. I was, for instance, to file through the iron bars of\r\nmy window. Then, on a rainy night, when the sentry on the boulevard\r\nwas dozing in his box, two friends were to creep up from behind and\r\noverturn the box, so that it would fall upon the sentry and catch him\r\nlike a mouse in a trap, without hurting him. In the meantime, I was to\r\njump out of the window. But a better solution came in an unexpected way.\r\n\r\n‘Ask to be let out for a walk,’ one of the soldiers whispered to me one\r\nday. I did so. The doctor supported my demand, and every afternoon, at\r\nfour, I was allowed to take an hour’s walk in the prison yard. I had to\r\nkeep on the green flannel dressing-gown which is worn by the hospital\r\npatients, but my boots, my vest, and my trousers were delivered to me\r\nevery day.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget my first walk. When I was taken out, I saw before\r\nme a yard fully three hundred paces long and more than two hundred\r\npaces wide, all covered with grass. The gate was open, and through it\r\nI could see the street, the immense hospital opposite, and the people\r\nwho passed by. I stopped on the doorsteps of the prison, unable for a\r\nmoment to move when I saw that yard and that gate.\r\n\r\nAt one end of the yard stood the prison--a narrow building, about one\r\nhundred and fifty paces long--at each end of which was a sentry-box.\r\nThe two sentries paced up and down in front of the building, and had\r\ntramped out a footpath in the green. Along this footpath I was told to\r\nwalk, and the two sentries continued to walk up and down--so that I was\r\nnever more than ten or fifteen paces from the one or the other. Three\r\nhospital soldiers took their seats on the doorsteps.\r\n\r\nAt the opposite end of this spacious yard wood for fuel was being\r\nunloaded from a dozen carts, and piled up along the wall by a dozen\r\npeasants. The whole yard was inclosed by a high fence made of thick\r\nboards. Its gate was open to let the carts in and out.\r\n\r\nThis open gate fascinated me. ‘I must not stare at it,’ I said to\r\nmyself; and yet I looked at it all the time. As soon as I was taken\r\nback to my cell I wrote to my friends to communicate to them the\r\nwelcome news. ‘I feel well-nigh unable to use the cipher,’ I wrote with\r\na tremulous hand, tracing almost illegible signs instead of figures.\r\n‘This nearness of liberty makes me tremble as if I were in a fever.\r\nThey took me out to-day in the yard; its gate was open, and no sentry\r\nnear it. Through this unguarded gate I will run out; my sentries will\r\nnot catch me’--and I gave the plan of the escape. ‘A lady is to come in\r\nan open carriage to the hospital. She is to alight, and the carriage\r\nto wait for her in the street, some fifty paces from the gate. When I\r\nam taken out at four, I shall walk for a while with my hat in my hand,\r\nand somebody who passes by the gate will take it as a signal that all\r\nis right within the prison. Then you must return a signal: “The street\r\nis clear.” Without it I shall not start: once beyond the gate I must\r\nnot be recaptured. Light or sound only can be used for your signal. The\r\ncoachman may send a flash of light--the sun’s rays reflected from his\r\nlacquered hat upon the main hospital building; or, still better, the\r\nsound of a song that goes on as long as the street is clear; unless\r\nyou can occupy the little gray bungalow which I see from the yard, and\r\nsignal to me from its window. The sentry will run after me like a dog\r\nafter a hare, describing a curve, while I run in a straight line, and\r\nI _will_ keep five or ten paces in advance of him. In the street, I\r\nshall spring into the carriage and we shall gallop away. If the sentry\r\nshoots--well, that cannot be helped; it lies beyond our foresight; and\r\nthen, against a certain death in prison, the thing is well worth the\r\nrisk.’\r\n\r\nCounter proposals were made, but that plan was ultimately adopted. The\r\nmatter was taken in hand by our circle; people who never had known me\r\nentered into it, as if it were the release of the dearest of their\r\nbrothers. However, the attempt was beset with difficulties, and time\r\nwent with terrible rapidity. I worked hard, writing late at night; but\r\nmy health improved, nevertheless, at a speed which I found appalling.\r\nWhen I was let out into the yard for the first time, I could only creep\r\nlike a tortoise along the footpath; now I felt strong enough to run.\r\nTrue, I continued to go at the same tortoise pace, lest my walks should\r\nbe stopped; but my natural vivacity might betray me at any moment. And\r\nmy comrades, in the meantime, had to enlist more than a score of people\r\nin the affair, to find a reliable horse and an experienced coachman,\r\nand to arrange hundreds of unforeseen details which always spring up\r\naround such conspiracies. The preparations took a month or so, and any\r\nday I might be moved back to the House of Detention.\r\n\r\nAt last the day of the escape was settled. June 29, old style, is\r\nthe day of St. Peter and St. Paul. My friends, throwing a touch of\r\nsentimentalism into their enterprise, wanted to set me free on that\r\nday. They had let me know that in reply to my signal ‘All right within’\r\nthey would signal ‘All right outside’ by sending up a red toy balloon.\r\nThen the carriage would come, and a song would be sung to let me know\r\nwhen the street was open.\r\n\r\nI went out on the 29th, took off my hat, and waited for the balloon.\r\nBut nothing of the kind was to be seen. Half an hour passed. I heard\r\nthe rumble of a carriage in the street; I heard a man’s voice singing a\r\nsong unknown to me; but there was no balloon.\r\n\r\nThe hour was over, and with a broken heart I returned to my room.\r\n‘Something must have gone wrong,’ I said to myself.\r\n\r\nThe impossible had happened that day. Hundreds of children’s balloons\r\nare always on sale in St. Petersburg, near the Gostínoi Dvor. That\r\nmorning there were none; not a single balloon was to be found. One was\r\ndiscovered at last, in the possession of a child, but it was old and\r\nwould not fly. My friends rushed then to an optician’s shop, bought\r\nan apparatus for making hydrogen, and filled the balloon with it; but\r\nit would not fly any better: the hydrogen had not been dried. Time\r\npressed. Then a lady attached the balloon to her umbrella, and, holding\r\nthe latter high above her head, walked up and down in the street\r\nalongside the high wall of our yard; but I saw nothing of it; the wall\r\nbeing too high, and the lady too short.\r\n\r\nAs it turned out, nothing could have been better than that accident\r\nwith the balloon. When the hour of my walk had passed, the carriage\r\nwas driven along the streets which it was intended to follow after the\r\nescape; and there, in a narrow street, it was stopped by a dozen or\r\nmore carts which were carrying wood to the hospital. The horses of the\r\ncarts got into disorder--some of them on the right side of the street,\r\nand some on the left--and the carriage had to make its way at a slow\r\npace amongst them; at a turning it was actually blocked. If I had been\r\nin it, we should have been caught.\r\n\r\nNow a whole system of signals was established along the streets through\r\nwhich we should have to go after the escape, in order to give notice\r\nif the streets were not clear. For a couple of miles from the hospital\r\nmy comrades took the position of sentries. One was to walk up and down\r\nwith a handkerchief in his hand, which at the approach of the carts\r\nhe was to put into his pocket; another was to sit on a stone and eat\r\ncherries, stopping when the carts came near; and so on. All these\r\nsignals, transmitted along the streets, were finally to reach the\r\ncarriage. My friends had also hired the gray bungalow that I could see\r\nfrom the yard, and at an open window of that little house a violinist\r\nstood with his violin, ready to play when the signal, ‘Street clear,’\r\nreached him.\r\n\r\nThe attempt had been settled for the next day. Further postponement\r\nwould have been dangerous. In fact, the carriage had been taken notice\r\nof by the hospital people, and something suspicious must have reached\r\nthe ears of the authorities, as on the night before my escape I heard\r\nthe patrol officer ask the sentry who stood opposite my window, ‘Where\r\nare your ball cartridges?’ The soldier began to take them in a clumsy\r\nway out of his cartridge pouch, spending a couple of minutes before\r\nhe got them. The patrol officer swore at him. ‘Have you not been told\r\nto-night to keep four ball cartridges in the pocket of your coat?’ And\r\nhe stood by the sentry till the latter put four cartridges into his\r\npocket. ‘Look sharp!’ he said as he turned away.\r\n\r\nThe new arrangements concerning the signals had to be communicated\r\nto me at once; and at two on the next day a lady--a dear relative of\r\nmine--came to the prison, asking that a watch might be transmitted to\r\nme. Everything had to go through the hands of the procureur; but as\r\nthis was simply a watch, without a box, it was passed along. In it was\r\na tiny cipher note which contained the whole plan. When I saw it I was\r\nseized with terror, so daring was the feat. The lady, herself under\r\npursuit by the police for political reasons, would have been arrested\r\non the spot, if anyone had chanced to open the lid of the watch. But I\r\nsaw her calmly leave the prison and move slowly along the boulevard.\r\n\r\nI came out at four, as usual, and gave my signal. I heard next the\r\nrumble of the carriage, and a few minutes later the tones of the violin\r\nin the gray house sounded through our yard. But I was then at the other\r\nend of the building. When I got back to the end of my path which was\r\nnearest the gate--about a hundred paces from it--the sentry was close\r\nupon my heels. ‘One turn more,’ I thought--but before I reached the\r\nfarther end of the path the violin suddenly ceased playing.\r\n\r\nMore than a quarter of an hour passed, full of anxiety, before I\r\nunderstood the cause of the interruption. Then a dozen heavily loaded\r\ncarts entered the gate and moved to the other end of the yard.\r\n\r\nImmediately the violinist--a good one, I must say--began a wildly\r\nexciting mazurka from Kontsky, as if to say, ‘Straight on now--this is\r\nyour time!’ I moved slowly to the nearer end of the footpath, trembling\r\nat the thought that the mazurka might stop before I reached it.\r\n\r\nWhen I was there I turned round. The sentry had stopped five or six\r\npaces behind me; he was looking the other way. ‘Now or never!’ I\r\nremember that thought flashing through my head. I flung off my green\r\nflannel dressing-gown and began to run.\r\n\r\nFor many days in succession I had practised how to get rid of that\r\nimmeasurably long and cumbrous garment. It was so long that I carried\r\nthe lower part on my left arm, as ladies carry the trains of their\r\nriding habits. Do what I might, it would not come off in one movement.\r\nI cut the seams under the armpits, but that did not help. Then I\r\ndecided to learn to throw it off in two movements: one, casting the\r\nend from my arm, the other dropping the gown on the floor. I practised\r\npatiently in my room until I could do it as neatly as soldiers handle\r\ntheir rifles. ‘One, two,’ and it was on the ground.\r\n\r\nI did not trust much to my vigour, and began to run rather slowly, to\r\neconomize my strength. But no sooner had I taken a few steps than the\r\npeasants who were piling the wood at the other end shouted, ‘He runs!\r\nStop him! Catch him!’ and they hastened to intercept me at the gate.\r\nThen I flew for my life. I thought of nothing but running--not even of\r\nthe pit which the carts had dug out at the gate. Run! run! full speed!\r\n\r\nThe sentry, I was told later by the friends who witnessed the scene\r\nfrom the gray house, ran after me, followed by three soldiers who had\r\nbeen sitting on the doorsteps. The sentry was so near to me that he\r\nfelt sure of catching me. Several times he flung his rifle forward,\r\ntrying to give me a blow in the back with the bayonet. One moment my\r\nfriends in the window thought he had me. He was so convinced that he\r\ncould stop me in this way that he did not fire. But I kept my distance,\r\nand he had to give up at the gate.\r\n\r\nSafe out of the gate, I perceived, to my terror, that the carriage was\r\noccupied by a civilian who wore a military cap. He sat without turning\r\nhis head to me. ‘Sold!’ was my first thought. The comrades had written\r\nin their last letter, ‘Once in the street, don’t give yourself up:\r\nthere will be friends to defend you in case of need,’ and I did not\r\nwant to jump into the carriage if it was occupied by an enemy. However,\r\nas I got nearer to the carriage I noticed that the man in it had sandy\r\nwhiskers which seemed to be those of a warm friend of mine. He did\r\nnot belong to our circle, but we were personal friends, and on more\r\nthan one occasion I had learned to know his admirable, daring courage,\r\nand how his strength suddenly became herculean when there was danger\r\nat hand. ‘Why should he be there? Is it possible?’ I reflected, and\r\nwas going to shout out his name, when I caught myself in good time,\r\nand instead clapped my hands, while still running, to attract his\r\nattention. He turned his face to me--and I knew who it was.\r\n\r\n‘Jump in, quick, quick!’ he shouted in a terrible voice, calling me\r\nand the coachman all sorts of names, a revolver in his hand and ready\r\nto shoot. ‘Gallop! gallop! I will kill you!’ he cried to the coachman.\r\nThe horse--a beautiful racing trotter, which had been bought on\r\npurpose--started at full gallop. Scores of voices yelling, ‘Hold them!\r\nGet them!’ resounded behind us, my friend meanwhile helping me to put\r\non an elegant overcoat and an opera hat. But the real danger was not so\r\nmuch in the pursuers as in a soldier who was posted at the gate of the\r\nhospital, about opposite to the spot where the carriage had to wait.\r\nHe could have prevented my jumping into the carriage or could have\r\nstopped the horse by simply rushing a few steps forward. A friend was\r\nconsequently commissioned to divert this soldier by talking. He did\r\nthis most successfully. The soldier having been employed at one time\r\nin the laboratory of the hospital, my friend gave a scientific turn to\r\ntheir chat, speaking about the microscope and the wonderful things one\r\nsees through it. Referring to a certain parasite of the human body, he\r\nasked, ‘Did you ever see what a formidable tail it has?’ ‘What, man, a\r\ntail?’ ‘Yes it has; under the microscope it is as big as that.’ ‘Don’t\r\ntell me any of your tales!’ retorted the soldier. ‘I know better. It\r\nwas the first thing I looked at under the microscope.’ This animated\r\ndiscussion took place just as I ran past them and sprang into the\r\ncarriage. It sounds like fable, but it is fact.\r\n\r\nThe carriage turned sharply into a narrow lane, past the same wall of\r\nthe yard where the peasants had been piling wood, and which all of them\r\nhad now deserted in their run after me. The turn was so sharp that the\r\ncarriage was nearly upset, when I flung myself inward, dragging toward\r\nme my friend; this sudden movement righted the carriage.\r\n\r\nWe trotted through the narrow lane and then turned to the left. Two\r\ngendarmes were standing there, at the door of a public-house, and gave\r\nto the military cap of my companion the military salute. ‘Hush! hush!’\r\nI said to him, for he was still terribly excited. ‘All goes well; the\r\ngendarmes salute us!’ The coachman thereupon turned his face toward me,\r\nand I recognized in him another friend, who smiled with happiness.\r\n\r\nEverywhere we saw friends, who winked to us or gave us a Godspeed as\r\nwe passed at the full trot of our beautiful horse. Then we entered the\r\nlarge Nevsky Perspective, turned into a side street, and alighted at a\r\ndoor, sending away the coachman. I ran up the staircase, and at its top\r\nfell into the arms of my sister-in-law, who had been waiting in painful\r\nanxiety. She laughed and cried at the same time, bidding me hurry to\r\nput on another dress and to crop my conspicuous beard. Ten minutes\r\nlater my friend and I left the house and took a cab.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the officer of the guard at the prison and the hospital\r\nsoldiers had rushed out into the street, doubtful as to what measures\r\nthey should take. There was not a cab for a mile round, every one\r\nhaving been hired by my friends. An old peasant woman from the crowd\r\nwas wiser than all the lot. ‘Poor people,’ she said, as if talking to\r\nherself, ‘they are sure to come out on the Perspective, and there they\r\nwill be caught if somebody runs along that lane, which leads straight\r\nto the Perspective.’ She was quite right, and the officer ran to the\r\ntramway car which stood close by, and asked the men to let him have\r\ntheir horses to send somebody on horseback to the Perspective. But the\r\nmen obstinately refused to give up their horses, and the officer did\r\nnot use force.\r\n\r\nAs to the violinist and the lady who had taken the gray house, they too\r\nrushed out and joined the crowd with the old woman, whom they heard\r\ngiving advice, and when the crowd dispersed they quietly went away.\r\n\r\nIt was a fine afternoon. We drove to the islands where the St.\r\nPetersburg aristocracy go on bright spring days to see the sunset, and\r\ncalled on the way, in a remote street, at a barber’s shop to shave off\r\nmy beard, which operation changed me, of course, but not very much. We\r\ndrove aimlessly up and down the islands, but, having been told not to\r\nreach our night quarters till late in the evening, did not know where\r\nto go. ‘What shall we do in the meantime?’ I asked my friend. He also\r\npondered over that question. ‘To Donon’s!’ he suddenly called out to\r\nthe cabman, naming one of the best St. Petersburg restaurants. ‘No one\r\nwill ever think of looking for you at Donon’s,’ he calmly remarked.\r\n‘They will hunt for you everywhere else, but not there; and we shall\r\nhave a dinner, and a drink, too, in honour of your successful escape.’\r\n\r\nWhat could I reply to so reasonable a suggestion? So we went to\r\nDonon’s, passed the halls flooded with light and crowded with visitors\r\nat the dinner hour, and took a separate room, where we spent the\r\nevening till the time came when we were expected. The house where we\r\nhad first alighted was searched less than two hours after we left, as\r\nwere also the apartments of nearly all our friends. Nobody thought of\r\nmaking a search at Donon’s.\r\n\r\nA couple of days later I was to take possession of an apartment which\r\nhad been engaged for me, and which I could occupy under a false\r\npassport. But the lady who was to take me in a carriage to that house\r\ntook the precaution of visiting it first by herself. It was densely\r\nsurrounded by spies. So many of my friends had come to inquire whether\r\nI was safe there that the suspicions of the police had been aroused.\r\nMoreover, my portrait had been printed by the Third Section, and\r\nhundreds of copies had been distributed to policemen and watchmen. All\r\nthe detectives who knew me by sight were looking for me in the streets;\r\nwhile those who did not were accompanied by soldiers and warders who\r\nhad seen me during my imprisonment. The Tsar was furious that such an\r\nescape should have taken place in his capital in full daylight, and had\r\ngiven the order, ‘He _must_ be found.’\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to remain at St. Petersburg, and I concealed myself\r\nin country houses in its neighbourhood. In company with half-a-dozen\r\nfriends, I stayed at a village frequented at this time of the year by\r\nSt. Petersburg people bent on picnicking. Then it was decided that I\r\nshould go abroad. But from a foreign paper we had learned that all the\r\nfrontier stations and the railway termini in the Baltic provinces and\r\nFinland were closely watched by detectives who knew me by sight. So I\r\ndetermined to travel in a direction where I should be least expected.\r\nArmed with the passport of a friend, and accompanied by another friend,\r\nI crossed Finland, and went northward to a remote port on the Gulf of\r\nBothnia, whence I crossed to Sweden.\r\n\r\nAfter I had gone on board the steamer, and it was about to sail,\r\nthe friend who was to accompany me to the frontier told me the St.\r\nPetersburg news, which he had promised our friends not to tell me\r\nbefore. My sister Hélène had been arrested, as well as the sister of\r\nmy brother’s wife, who had visited me in prison once a month after my\r\nbrother and his wife went to Siberia.\r\n\r\nMy sister knew absolutely nothing of the preparations for my escape.\r\nOnly after I had escaped a friend had hurried to her, to tell her\r\nthe welcome news. She protested her ignorance in vain: she was taken\r\nfrom her children, and was kept imprisoned for a fortnight. As to the\r\nsister of my brother’s wife, she had known vaguely that something\r\nwas to be attempted, but she had had no part in the preparations.\r\nCommon sense ought to have shown the authorities that a person who\r\nhad officially visited me in prison would not be involved in such an\r\naffair. Nevertheless, she was kept in prison for over two months. Her\r\nhusband, a well-known lawyer, vainly endeavoured to obtain her release.\r\n‘We are aware now,’ he was told by the gendarme officers, ‘that she has\r\nhad nothing to do with the escape; but, you see, we reported to the\r\nemperor, on the day we arrested her, that the person who had organized\r\nthe escape was discovered and arrested. It will now take some time\r\nto prepare the emperor to accept the idea that she is not the real\r\nculprit.’\r\n\r\nI crossed Sweden without stopping anywhere, and went to Christiania,\r\nwhere I waited a few days for a steamer to sail for Hull, gathering\r\ninformation in the meantime about the peasant party of the Norwegian\r\nStorthing. As I went to the steamer I asked myself with anxiety, ‘Under\r\nwhich flag does she sail--Norwegian, German, English?’ Then I saw\r\nfloating above the stern the Union Jack--the flag under which so many\r\nrefugees, Russian, Italian, French, Hungarian, and of all nations, have\r\nfound an asylum. I greeted that flag from the depth of my heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART SIXTH\r\n\r\nWESTERN EUROPE\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nA storm raged in the North Sea, as we approached the coasts of England.\r\nBut I met the storm with delight. I enjoyed the struggle of our steamer\r\nagainst the furiously rolling waves, and sat for hours on the stem,\r\nthe foam of the waves dashing into my face. After the two years I had\r\nspent in a gloomy casemate, every fibre of my inner self seemed to be\r\nthrobbing with life, and eager to enjoy the full intensity of life.\r\n\r\nMy intention was not to stay abroad more than a few weeks or months;\r\njust enough time to allow the hue and cry caused by my escape to\r\nsubside, and also to restore my health a little. I landed under the\r\nname of Lavashóff, the name under which I had left Russia; and,\r\navoiding London, where the spies of the Russian embassy would soon have\r\nbeen at my heels, I went first to Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nIt has, however, so happened that I have never returned to Russia. I\r\nwas soon taken up by the wave of the anarchist movement, which was\r\njust then rising in Western Europe; and I felt that I should be more\r\nuseful in helping that movement to find its proper expression than I\r\ncould possibly be in Russia. In my mother country I was too well known\r\nto carry on an open propaganda, especially among the workers and the\r\npeasants; and later on, when the Russian movement became a conspiracy\r\nand an armed struggle against the representative of autocracy, all\r\nthought of a popular movement was necessarily abandoned; while my\r\nown inclinations drew me more and more intensely toward casting in\r\nmy lot with the labouring and toiling masses. To bring to them such\r\nconceptions as would aid them to direct their efforts to the best\r\nadvantage of all the workers; to deepen and to widen the ideals and\r\nprinciples which will underlie the coming social revolution; to\r\ndevelop these ideals and principles before the workers, not as an\r\norder coming from their leaders, but as a result of their own reason;\r\nand so to awaken their own initiative, now that they were called upon\r\nto appear in the historical arena as the builders of a new, equitable\r\nmode of organization of society--this seemed to me as necessary for\r\nthe development of mankind as anything I could accomplish in Russia\r\nat that time. Accordingly, I joined the few men who were working in\r\nthat direction in Western Europe, relieving those of them who had been\r\nbroken down by years of hard struggle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen I landed at Hull and went to Edinburgh I informed but a few\r\nfriends in Russia and in the Jura Federation of my safe arrival in\r\nEngland. A socialist must always rely upon his own work for his living,\r\nand consequently, as soon as I was settled in the Scotch capital in a\r\nsmall room in the suburbs, I tried to find some work.\r\n\r\nAmong the passengers on board our steamer there was a Norwegian\r\nprofessor, with whom I talked, trying to remember the little that I\r\nformerly had known of the Swedish language. He spoke German. ‘But as\r\nyou speak some Norwegian,’ he said to me, ‘and are trying to learn it,\r\nlet us both speak it.’\r\n\r\n‘You mean Swedish?’ I ventured to ask, ‘I speak Swedish, don’t I?’\r\n\r\n‘Well, I should rather say Norwegian; certainly not Swedish,’ was his\r\nreply.\r\n\r\nThus happened to me what happened to one of Jules Verne’s heroes, who\r\nhad learned by mistake Portuguese instead of Spanish. At any rate,\r\nI talked a good deal with the professor--let it be Norwegian--and\r\nhe gave me a Christiania paper, which contained the reports of the\r\nNorwegian North Atlantic deep-sea expedition, just returned home. As\r\nsoon as I reached Edinburgh I wrote a note in English about these\r\nexplorations, and sent it to ‘Nature,’ which my brother and I used\r\nregularly to read at St. Petersburg from its first appearance. The\r\nsub-editor acknowledged the note with thanks, remarking with an\r\nextreme leniency which I have often met with since in England, that\r\nmy English was ‘all right’ and only required to be ‘a little more\r\nidiomatic.’ I may say that I had learned English in Russia, and, with\r\nmy brother, had translated Page’s ‘Philosophy of Geology’ and Herbert\r\nSpencer’s ‘Principles of Biology.’ But I had learned it from books,\r\nand pronounced it very badly, so that I had the greatest difficulty in\r\nmaking myself understood by my Scotch landlady; her daughter and I used\r\nto write on scraps of paper what we had to say to each other; and as\r\nI had no idea of idiomatic English, I must have made the most amusing\r\nmistakes. I remember, at any rate, protesting once to her, in writing,\r\nthat it was not a ‘cup of tea’ that I expected at tea time, but many\r\ncups. I am afraid my landlady took me for a glutton, but I must say,\r\nby way of apology, that neither in the geological books I had read in\r\nEnglish nor in Spencer’s ‘Biology’ was there any allusion to such an\r\nimportant matter as tea-drinking.\r\n\r\nI got from Russia the Journal of the Russian Geographical Society,\r\nand soon began to supply the ‘Times’ also with occasional paragraphs\r\nabout Russian geographical explorations. Prjeválsky was at that time in\r\nCentral Asia, and his progress was followed in England with interest.\r\n\r\nHowever, the money I had brought with me was rapidly disappearing, and\r\nall my letters to Russia being intercepted, I could not succeed in\r\nmaking my address known to my relatives. So I moved in a few weeks to\r\nLondon, thinking I could find more regular work there. The old refugee,\r\nP. L. Lavróff, continued to edit at London his newspaper _Forward_; but\r\nas I hoped soon to return to Russia, and the editorial office of the\r\nRussian paper must have been closely watched by spies, I did not go\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nI went, very naturally, to the office of ‘Nature,’ where I was most\r\ncordially received by the sub-editor, Mr. J. Scott Keltie. The editor\r\nwanted to increase the column of Notes, and found that I wrote them\r\nexactly as they were required. A table was consequently assigned me\r\nin the office, and scientific reviews in all possible languages were\r\npiled upon it. ‘Come every Monday, Mr. Levashóff,’ I was told, ‘look\r\nover these reviews, and if there is any article that strikes you as\r\nworthy of notice, write a note, or mark the article: we will send it\r\nto a specialist.’ Mr. Keltie did not know, of course, that I used to\r\nrewrite each note three or four times before I dared to submit my\r\nEnglish to him; but taking the scientific reviews home, I soon managed\r\nvery nicely, with my ‘Nature’ notes and my ‘Times’ paragraphs, to get a\r\nliving. I found that the weekly payment, on Thursday, of the paragraph\r\ncontributors to the ‘Times’ was an excellent institution. To be sure,\r\nthere were weeks when there was no interesting news from Prjeválsky,\r\nand news from other parts of Russia was not found interesting; in such\r\ncases my fare was bread and tea only.\r\n\r\nOne day, however, Mr. Keltie took from the shelves several Russian\r\nbooks, asking me to review them for ‘Nature.’ I looked at the books,\r\nand, to my embarrassment, saw that they were my own works on the\r\nGlacial Period and the Orography of Asia. My brother had not failed to\r\nsend them to our favourite ‘Nature.’ I was in great perplexity, and,\r\nputting the books into my bag, took them home, to reflect upon the\r\nmatter. ‘What shall I do with them?’ I asked myself. ‘I cannot praise\r\nthem, because they are mine; and I cannot be too sharp on the author,\r\nas I hold the views expressed in them.’ I decided to take them back\r\nnext day, and explain to Mr. Keltie that, although I had introduced\r\nmyself under the name of Levashóff, I was the author of these books,\r\nand could not review them.\r\n\r\nMr. Keltie knew from the papers about Kropótkin’s escape, and was\r\nvery much pleased to discover the refugee safe in England. As to my\r\nscruples, he remarked wisely that I need neither scold nor praise the\r\nauthor, but could simply tell the readers what the books were about.\r\nFrom that day a friendship, which still continues, grew up between us.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn November or December 1876, seeing in the letter box of P. L.\r\nLavróff’s paper an invitation for ‘K.’ to call at the editorial office\r\nto receive a letter from Russia, and thinking that the invitation was\r\nfor me, I called at the office, and soon established friendship with\r\nthe editor and the younger people who printed the paper.\r\n\r\nWhen I called for the first time at the office--my beard shaved and my\r\ntop hat on--and asked the lady who opened the door, in my very best\r\nEnglish: ‘Is Mr. Lavróff in?’ I imagined that no one would ever know\r\nwho I was as long as I had not mentioned my name. It appeared, however,\r\nthat the lady--who did not know me at all, but well knew my brother\r\nwhile he stayed at Zürich--at once recognized me and ran upstairs to\r\nsay who the visitor was. ‘I knew you immediately,’ she said afterwards,\r\n‘by your eyes, which reminded me of those of your brother.’\r\n\r\nThat time, I did not stay long in England. I was in lively\r\ncorrespondence with my friend James Guillaume, of the Jura Federation,\r\nand as soon as I found some permanent geographical work, which I could\r\ndo in Switzerland as well as in London, I removed to Switzerland. The\r\nletters that I got at last from home told me that I might as well stay\r\nabroad, as there was nothing particular to be done in Russia. A wave of\r\nenthusiasm was rolling over the country at that time in favour of the\r\nSlavonians who had revolted against the age-long Turkish oppression,\r\nand my best friends, Serghéi (Stepniák), Kelnitz, and several others\r\nhad gone to the Balkán peninsula to join the insurgents. ‘We read,’\r\nmy friends wrote, ‘the “Daily News” correspondence about the horrors\r\nin Bulgaria; we weep at the reading, and go next to enlist either as\r\nvolunteers in the Balkán insurgents’ band or as nurses.’\r\n\r\nI went to Switzerland, joined the Jura Federation of the International\r\nWorkingmen’s Association, and, following the advice of my Swiss\r\nfriends, settled in La Chaux-de-Fonds.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe Jura Federation has played an important part in the modern\r\ndevelopment of socialism.\r\n\r\nIt always happens that after a political party has set before itself\r\na purpose, and has proclaimed that nothing short of the complete\r\nattainment of that aim will satisfy it, it divides into two fractions.\r\nOne of them remains what it was, while the other, although it professes\r\nnot to have changed a word of its previous intentions, accepts some\r\nsort of compromise, and gradually, from compromise to compromise, is\r\ndriven farther from its primitive programme, and becomes a party of\r\nmodest makeshift reform.\r\n\r\nSuch a division had occurred within the International Workingmen’s\r\nAssociation. Nothing less than an expropriation of the present owners\r\nof land and capital, and a transmission of all that is necessary for\r\nthe production of wealth to the producers themselves, was the avowed\r\naim of the Association at the outset. The workers of all nations were\r\ncalled upon to form their own organizations for a direct struggle\r\nagainst capitalism; to work out the means of socializing the production\r\nof wealth and its consumption; and, when they should be ready to do so,\r\nto take possession of the necessaries for production, and to control\r\nproduction with no regard to the present political organization, which\r\nmust undergo a complete reconstruction. The Association had thus to be\r\nthe means for preparing an immense revolution in men’s minds, and later\r\non in the very forms of life--a revolution which would open to mankind\r\na new era of progress based upon the solidarity of all. That was the\r\nideal which aroused from their slumber millions of European workers,\r\nand attracted to the Association its best intellectual forces.\r\n\r\nHowever, two fractions soon developed. When the war of 1870 had ended\r\nin a complete defeat of France, and the uprising of the Paris Commune\r\nhad been crushed, and the Draconian laws which were passed against\r\nthe Association excluded the French workers from participation in it;\r\nand when, on the other hand, parliamentary rule had been introduced\r\nin ‘united Germany’--the goal of the Radicals since 1848--an effort\r\nwas made by the Germans to modify the aims and the methods of the\r\nwhole socialist movement. The ‘conquest of power _within the existing\r\nstates_’ became the watchword of that section, which took the name of\r\n‘Social Democracy.’ The first electoral successes of this party at\r\nthe elections to the German Reichstag aroused great hopes. The number\r\nof the social democratic deputies having grown from two to seven, and\r\nnext to nine, it was confidently calculated by otherwise reasonable\r\nmen that before the end of the century the social democrats would\r\nhave a majority in the German Parliament, and would then introduce\r\nthe socialist ‘popular state’ by means of suitable legislation.\r\nThe socialist ideal of this party gradually lost the character of\r\nsomething that had to be worked out by the labour organizations\r\nthemselves, and became state management of the industries--in fact,\r\nstate socialism; that is, state capitalism. To-day, in Switzerland,\r\nthe efforts of the social democrats are directed in politics toward\r\ncentralization as against federalism, and in the economic field to\r\npromoting the state management of railways and the state monopoly of\r\nbanking and of the sale of spirits. The state management of the land\r\nand of the leading industries, and even of the consumption of riches,\r\nwould be the next step in a more or less distant future.\r\n\r\nGradually, all the life and activity of the German social democratic\r\nparty was subordinated to electoral considerations. Trade unions were\r\ntreated with contempt and strikes were met with disapproval, because\r\nboth diverted the attention of the workers from electoral struggles.\r\nEvery popular outbreak, every revolutionary agitation in any country of\r\nEurope, was received by the social democratic leaders with even more\r\nanimosity than by the capitalist press.\r\n\r\nIn the Latin countries, however, this new direction found but few\r\nadherents. The sections and federations of the International remained\r\ntrue to the principles which had prevailed at the foundation of the\r\nAssociation. Federalist by their history, hostile to the idea of a\r\ncentralized state, and possessed of revolutionary traditions, the Latin\r\nworkers could not follow the evolution of the Germans.\r\n\r\nThe division between the two branches of the socialist movement became\r\napparent immediately after the Franco-German war. The International, as\r\nI have already mentioned, had created a governing body in the shape of\r\na general council which resided at London; and the leading spirits of\r\nthat council being two Germans, Engels and Marx, the council became the\r\nstronghold of the new social democratic direction; while the inspirers\r\nand intellectual leaders of the Latin federations were Bakúnin and his\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nThe conflict between the Marxists and the Bakúnists was not a personal\r\naffair. It was the necessary conflict between the principles of\r\nfederalism and those of centralization, the free Commune and the\r\nState’s paternal rule, the free action of the masses of the people and\r\nthe betterment of existing capitalist conditions through legislation--a\r\nconflict between the Latin spirit and the German _Geist_, which,\r\nafter the defeat of France on the battlefield, claimed supremacy in\r\nscience, politics, philosophy, and in socialism too, representing\r\nits own conception of socialism as ‘scientific,’ while all other\r\ninterpretations it described as ‘utopian.’\r\n\r\nAt the Hague Congress of the International Association, which was\r\nheld in 1872, the London general council, by means of a fictitious\r\nmajority, excluded Bakúnin, his friend Guillaume, and even the Jura\r\nFederation from the International. But as it was certain that most\r\nof what remained then of the International--that is, the Spanish,\r\nthe Italian, and the Belgian Federations--would side with the\r\nJurassians, the congress tried to dissolve the Association. A new\r\ngeneral council, composed of a few social democrats, was nominated in\r\nNew York, where there were no workmen’s organizations belonging to\r\nthe Association to control it, and where it has never been heard of\r\nsince. In the meantime, the Spanish, the Italian, the Belgian, and\r\nthe Jura Federations of the International continued to exist and to\r\nmeet as usual, for the next five or six years, in annual international\r\ncongresses.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Jura Federation, at the time when I came to Switzerland, was the\r\ncentre and the leading voice of the international federations. Bakúnin\r\nhad just died (July 1, 1876), but the federation retained the position\r\nit had taken under his impulse.\r\n\r\nThe conditions in France, Spain, and Italy were such that only the\r\nmaintenance of the revolutionary spirit that had developed amongst the\r\nInternationalist workers previous to the Franco-German war prevented\r\nthe governments from taking decisive steps toward crushing the whole\r\nlabour movement and inaugurating the reign of White Terror. It is\r\nwell known that the re-establishment of a Bourbon monarchy in France\r\nwas very near becoming an accomplished fact. Marshal MacMahon was\r\nmaintained as president of the republic only in order to prepare for a\r\nmonarchist restoration; the very day of the solemn entry of Henry V.\r\ninto Paris was settled, and even the harnesses of the horses, adorned\r\nwith the pretender’s crown and initials, were ready. And it is also\r\nknown that it was only the fact that Gambetta and Clémenceau--the\r\nopportunist and the radical--had covered wide portions of France with\r\ncommittees, armed and ready to rise as soon as the _coup d’état_\r\nshould be made, which prevented the proposed restoration. But the real\r\nstrength of those committees was in the workers, many of whom had\r\nformerly belonged to the International and had retained the old spirit.\r\nSpeaking from personal knowledge, I may venture to say that the radical\r\nmiddle-class leaders would have hesitated in case of an emergency,\r\nwhile the workers would have seized the first opportunity for an\r\nuprising which, beginning with the defence of the republic, might have\r\ngone further on in the socialist direction.\r\n\r\nThe same was true in Spain. As soon as the clerical and aristocratic\r\nsurroundings of the king drove him to turn the screws of reaction,\r\nthe republicans menaced him with a movement in which, they knew,\r\nthe real fighting element would be the workers. In Catalonia alone\r\nthere were over one hundred thousand men in strongly organized trade\r\nunions, and more than eighty thousand Spaniards belonged to the\r\nInternational, regularly holding congresses, and punctually paying\r\ntheir contributions to the association with a truly Spanish sense\r\nof duty. I can speak of these organizations from personal knowledge,\r\ngained on the spot, and I know that they were ready to proclaim the\r\nUnited States of Spain, abandon ruling the colonies, and in some of\r\nthe most advanced regions make serious attempts in the direction of\r\ncollectivism. It was this permanent menace which prevented the Spanish\r\nmonarchy from suppressing all the workers’ and peasants’ organizations,\r\nand from inaugurating a frank clerical reaction.\r\n\r\nSimilar conditions prevailed also in Italy. The trade unions in North\r\nItaly had not reached the strength they have now; but parts of Italy\r\nwere honeycombed with International sections and republican groups.\r\nThe monarchy was kept under continual menace of being upset should the\r\nmiddle-class republicans appeal to the revolutionary elements among the\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\nIn short, looking back upon these years, from which we are separated\r\nnow by a quarter of a century, I am firmly persuaded that if Europe\r\ndid not pass through a period of stern reaction after 1871, this was\r\nmainly due to the spirit which was aroused in Western Europe before\r\nthe Franco-German war, and has been maintained since by the Anarchist\r\nInternationalists, the Blanquists, the Mazzinians, and the Spanish\r\n‘cantonalist’ republicans.\r\n\r\nOf course, the Marxists, absorbed by their local electoral\r\nstruggles, knew little of these conditions. Anxious not to draw the\r\nthunderbolts of Bismarck upon their heads, and fearing above all that\r\na revolutionary spirit might make its appearance in Germany and lead\r\nto repressions which they were not strong enough to face, they not\r\nonly repudiated, for tactical purposes, all sympathy with the Western\r\nrevolutionists, but gradually became inspired with hatred toward the\r\nrevolutionary spirit, and denounced it with virulence wheresoever it\r\nmade its appearance, even when they saw its first signs in Russia.\r\n\r\nNo revolutionary papers could be printed in France at that time,\r\nunder Marshal MacMahon. Even the singing of the ‘Marseillaise’ was\r\nconsidered a crime; and I was once very much amazed at the terror\r\nwhich seized several of my co-passengers in a train when they heard\r\na few recruits singing the revolutionary song (in May 1878). ‘Is it\r\npermitted again to sing the “Marseillaise”?’ they asked one another\r\nwith anxiety. The French Press had consequently no socialist papers.\r\nThe Spanish papers were very well edited, and some of the manifestoes\r\nof their congresses were admirable expositions of anarchist socialism;\r\nbut who knows anything of Spanish ideas outside of Spain? As to the\r\nItalian papers, they were all short-lived, appearing, disappearing, and\r\nre-appearing elsewhere under different names; and admirable as some of\r\nthem were, they did not spread beyond Italy. Consequently, the Jura\r\nFederation, with its papers printed in French, became the centre for\r\nthe maintenance and expression in the Latin countries of the spirit\r\nwhich--I repeat it--saved Europe from a very dark period of reaction.\r\nAnd it was also the ground upon which the theoretical conceptions of\r\nanarchism were worked out by Bakúnin and his followers in a language\r\nthat was understood all over continental Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nQuite a number of remarkable men of different nationalities, nearly all\r\nof whom had been personal friends of Bakúnin, belonged at that time\r\nto the Jura Federation. The editor of our chief paper, the ‘Bulletin’\r\nof the federation, was James Guillaume, a teacher by profession, who\r\nbelonged to one of the aristocratic families of Neuchâtel. Small, thin,\r\nwith the stiff appearance and resoluteness of Robespierre, and with a\r\ntruly golden heart which opened only in the intimacy of friendship,\r\nhe was a born leader by his phenomenal powers of work and his stern\r\nactivity. For eight years he fought against all sorts of obstacles to\r\nmaintain the paper in existence, taking the most active part in every\r\ndetail of the federation, till he had to leave Switzerland, where he\r\ncould find no work whatever, and settled in France, where his name will\r\nbe quoted some day with the utmost respect in the history of education.\r\n\r\nAdhémar Schwitzguébel, also a Swiss, was the type of the jovial,\r\nlively, clear-sighted French-speaking watchmakers of the Bernese\r\nJura hills. A watch engraver by trade, he never attempted to abandon\r\nhis position of manual worker, and, always merry and active, he\r\nsupported his large family through the severest periods of slack trade\r\nand curtailed earnings. His gift of taking a difficult economic or\r\npolitical question, and, after much thought about it, considering it\r\nfrom the working-man’s point of view, without divesting it of its\r\ndeepest meaning, was wonderful. He was known far and wide in the\r\n‘mountains,’ and with the workers of all countries he was a general\r\nfavourite.\r\n\r\nHis direct counterpart was another Swiss, also a watchmaker, Spichiger.\r\nHe was a philosopher, slow in both movement and thought, English in\r\nhis physical aspect; always trying to get at the full meaning of every\r\nfact, and impressing all of us by the justness of the conclusions he\r\nreached while he was pondering over all sorts of subjects during his\r\nwork of scooping out watch lids.\r\n\r\nRound these three gathered a number of solid, staunch, middle-aged or\r\nelderly workmen, passionate lovers of liberty, happy to take part in\r\nsuch a promising movement, and a hundred or so bright young men, also\r\nmostly watchmakers--all very independent and affectionate, very lively,\r\nand ready to go to any length in self-sacrifice.\r\n\r\nSeveral refugees of the Paris Commune had joined the federation. Elisée\r\nReclus, the great geographer, was of their number--a type of the\r\ntrue Puritan in his manner of life, and of the French encyclopædist\r\nphilosopher of the last century in his mind; the man who inspires\r\nothers, but never has governed anyone, and never will do so; the\r\nanarchist whose anarchism is the epitome of his broad, intimate\r\nknowledge of the forms of life of mankind under all climates and in\r\nall stages of civilization; whose books rank among the very best of\r\nthe century; whose style, of a striking beauty, moves the mind and the\r\nconscience; and who, as he enters the office of an anarchist paper,\r\nsays to the editor--maybe a boy in comparison with himself: ‘Tell me\r\nwhat I have to do,’ and will sit down, like a newspaper subordinate,\r\nto fill up a gap of so many lines in the current number of the paper.\r\nIn the Paris Commune he simply took a rifle and stood in the ranks;\r\nand if he invites a contributor to work with him upon a volume of his\r\nworld-famed Geography, and the contributor timidly asks, ‘What have I\r\nto do?’ he replies: ‘Here are the books, here is a table. Do as you\r\nlike.’\r\n\r\nAt his side was Lefrançais, an elderly man, formerly a teacher, who had\r\nbeen thrice in his life an exile: after June 1848, after Napoleon’s\r\n_coup d’état_, and after 1871. An ex-member of the Commune, and\r\nconsequently one of those who were said to have left Paris carrying\r\naway millions in their pockets, he worked as a freight handler at the\r\nrailway at Lausanne, and was nearly killed in that work, which required\r\nyounger shoulders than his. His book on the Paris Commune is the one\r\nin which the real historical meaning of that movement was put in its\r\nproper light. ‘A Communalist, not an Anarchist, please,’ he would say.\r\n‘I cannot work with such fools as you are;’ and he worked with none but\r\nus, ‘because,’ as he said, ‘you fools are still the men whom I love\r\nbest. With you one can work, and remain one’s self.’\r\n\r\nAnother ex-member of the Paris Commune who was with us was Pindy,\r\na carpenter from the north of France, an adopted child of Paris.\r\nHe became widely known at Paris, during a strike, supported by the\r\nInternational, for his vigour and bright intelligence, and was elected\r\na member of the Commune, which nominated him commander of the Tuileries\r\nPalace. When the Versailles troops entered Paris, shooting their\r\nprisoners by the hundred, three men at least were shot in different\r\nparts of the town, having been mistaken for Pindy. After the fight,\r\nhowever, he was concealed by a brave girl, a seamstress, who saved him\r\nby her calmness when the house was searched by the troops, and who\r\nafterwards became his wife. Only twelve months later they succeeded in\r\nleaving Paris unnoticed, and came to Switzerland. Here Pindy learned\r\nassaying, at which he became skilful; spending his days by the side\r\nof his red-hot stove, and at night devoting himself passionately to\r\npropaganda work, in which he admirably combined the passion of a\r\nrevolutionist with the good sense and organizing powers characteristic\r\nof the Parisian worker.\r\n\r\nPaul Brousse was then a young doctor, full of mental activity,\r\nuproarious, sharp, lively, ready to develop any idea with a geometrical\r\nlogic to its utmost consequences; powerful in his criticisms of the\r\nState and State organization; finding enough time to edit two papers,\r\nin French and in German, to write scores of voluminous letters, to be\r\nthe soul of a workmen’s evening party; constantly active in organizing\r\nmen, with the subtle mind of a true ‘southerner.’\r\n\r\nAmong the Italians who collaborated with us in Switzerland, two men\r\nwhose names stood always associated, and will be remembered in Italy\r\nby more than one generation, two close personal friends of Bakúnin,\r\nwere Cafiero and Malatesta. Cafiero was an idealist of the highest and\r\nthe purest type, who gave a considerable fortune to the cause, and\r\nwho never since has asked himself what he shall live upon to-morrow;\r\na thinker plunged in philosophical speculation; a man who never would\r\nharm anyone, and yet took the rifle and marched in the mountains of\r\nBenevento, when he and his friends thought that an uprising of a\r\nsocialist character might be attempted, were it only to show the people\r\nthat their uprisings ought to have a deeper meaning than that of a mere\r\nrevolt against tax collectors. Malatesta was a student of medicine,\r\nwho had left the medical profession and also his fortune for the sake\r\nof the revolution; full of fire and intelligence, a pure idealist, who\r\nall his life--and he is now approaching the age of fifty--has never\r\nthought whether he would have a piece of bread for his supper and a\r\nbed for the night. Without even so much as a room that he could call\r\nhis own, he would sell sherbet in the streets of London to get his\r\nliving, and in the evening write brilliant articles for the Italian\r\npapers. Imprisoned in France, released, expelled, recondemned in Italy,\r\nconfined to an island, escaped, and again in Italy in disguise; always\r\nin the hottest of the struggle, whether it be in Italy or elsewhere--he\r\nhas persevered in this life for thirty years in succession. And when we\r\nmeet him again, released from a prison or escaped from an island, we\r\nfind him just as we saw him last; always renewing the struggle, with\r\nthe same love of men, the same absence of hatred toward his adversaries\r\nand jailers, the same hearty smile for a friend, the same caress for a\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nThe Russians were few among us, most of them following the German\r\nsocial democrats. We had, however, Joukóvsky, a friend of Hérzen, who\r\nhad left Russia in 1863--a brilliant, elegant, highly intelligent\r\nnobleman, a favourite with the workers--who better than any of the\r\nrest of us had what the French call _l’oreille du peuple_ (the ear of\r\nthe workers), because he knew how to fire them by showing them the\r\ngreat part they had to play in rebuilding society, to lift them by\r\nholding before them high historical views, to throw a flash of light\r\non the most intricate economic problem, and to electrify them with his\r\nearnestness and sincerity. Sokolóff, formerly an officer of the Russian\r\ngeneral staff, an admirer of Paul Louis Courier for his boldness and of\r\nProudhon for his philosophical ideas, who had made many a socialist in\r\nRussia by his review articles, was also with us temporarily.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI mention only those who became widely known as writers, or as\r\ndelegates to congresses, or in some other way. And yet I ask myself if\r\nI ought not rather to speak of those who never committed their names\r\nto print, but were as important in the life of the federation as any\r\none of the writers; who fought in the ranks, and were always ready\r\nto join in any enterprise, never asking whether the work would be\r\ngrand or small, distinguished or modest--whether it would have great\r\nconsequences, or simply result in infinite worry to themselves and\r\ntheir families.\r\n\r\nI ought also to mention the Germans Werner and Rinke, the Spaniard\r\nAlbarracin, and many others; but I am afraid that these faint sketches\r\nof mine may not convey to the reader the same feelings of respect and\r\nlove with which every one of this little family inspired those who knew\r\nhim or her personally.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nOf all the towns of Switzerland that I know, La Chaux-de-Fonds is\r\nperhaps the least attractive. It lies on a high plateau entirely\r\ndevoid of any vegetation, open to bitterly cold winds in the winter,\r\nwhen the snow lies as deep as at Moscow, and melts and falls again\r\nas often as at St. Petersburg. But it was important to spread our\r\nideas in that centre, and to give more life to the local propaganda.\r\nPindy, Spichiger, Albarracin, the two Blanquists, Ferré and Jeallot,\r\nwere there, and from time to time I could pay visits to Guillaume at\r\nNeuchâtel, and to Schwitzguébel in the valley of St. Imier.\r\n\r\nA life full of work that I liked began now for me. We held many\r\nmeetings, distributing ourselves our announcements in the cafés and the\r\nworkshops. Once a week we held our section meetings, at which the most\r\nanimated discussions took place, and we went also to preach anarchism\r\nat the gatherings convoked by the political parties. I travelled a good\r\ndeal, visiting other sections and helping them.\r\n\r\nDuring that winter we won the sympathy of many, but our regular work\r\nwas very much hampered by a crisis in the watch trade. Half the\r\nworkers were out of work or only partially employed, so that the\r\nmunicipality had to open dining rooms to provide cheap meals at cost\r\nprice. The co-operative workshop established by the anarchists at La\r\nChaux-de-Fonds, in which the earnings were divided equally among all\r\nthe members, had great difficulty in getting work, in spite of its high\r\nreputation, and Spichiger had to resort several times to wool-combing\r\nfor an upholsterer in order to get his living.\r\n\r\nWe all took part, that year, in a manifestation with the red flag at\r\nBern. The wave of reaction spread to Switzerland, and the carrying\r\nof the workers’ banner was prohibited by the Bern police in defiance\r\nof the constitution. It was necessary, therefore, to show that at\r\nleast here and there the workers would not have their rights trampled\r\nunderfoot, and would offer resistance. We all went to Bern on the\r\nanniversary of the Paris Commune, to carry the red flag in the streets,\r\nnotwithstanding the prohibition. Of course there was a collision with\r\nthe police in which two comrades received sword cuts and two police\r\nofficers were rather seriously wounded. But the red flag was carried\r\nsafe to the hall, where a most animated meeting was held. I hardly\r\nneed say that the so-called leaders were in the ranks, and fought\r\nlike all the rest. The trial involved nearly thirty Swiss citizens,\r\nall themselves demanding to be prosecuted, and those who had wounded\r\nthe two police officers coming forward spontaneously to say that they\r\nhad done it. A great deal of sympathy was won to the cause during\r\nthe trial; it was understood that all liberties have to be defended\r\njealously, in order not to be lost. The sentences were consequently\r\nvery light, not exceeding three months’ imprisonment.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Bern Government prohibited the carrying of the red flag\r\nanywhere in the canton; and the Jura Federation thereupon decided to\r\ncarry it, in defiance of the prohibition, in St. Imier, where we held\r\nour congress that year. This time most of us were armed, and ready to\r\ndefend our banner to the last extremity. A body of police had been\r\nplaced in a square to stop our column; a detachment of the militia was\r\nkept in readiness in an adjoining field, under the pretext of target\r\npractice--we distinctly heard their shots as we marched through the\r\ntown. But when our column appeared in the square, and it was judged\r\nfrom its aspect that aggression would result in serious bloodshed,\r\nthe mayor let us continue our march undisturbed to the hall where the\r\nmeeting was to be held. None of us desired a fight; but the strain of\r\nthat march in fighting order, to the sound of a military band, was such\r\nthat I do not know what feeling prevailed in most of us during the\r\nfirst moments after we reached the hall--relief at having been spared\r\nan undesired fight, or regret that the fight did not take place. Man is\r\na very complex being.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur main activity, however, was in working out the practical and\r\ntheoretical aspects of anarchist socialism, and in this direction the\r\nfederation has undoubtedly accomplished something that will last.\r\n\r\nWe saw that a new form of society is germinating in the civilized\r\nnations, and must take the place of the old one: a society of equals,\r\nwho will not be compelled to sell their hands and brains to those who\r\nchoose to employ them in a haphazard way, but who will be able to\r\napply their knowledge and capacities to production, in an organism so\r\nconstructed as to combine all the efforts for procuring the greatest\r\nsum possible of well-being for all, while full, free scope will be\r\nleft for every individual initiative. This society will be composed\r\nof a multitude of associations, federated for all the purposes\r\nwhich require federation: trade federations for production of all\r\nsorts--agricultural, industrial, intellectual, artistic; communes\r\nfor consumption, making provision for dwellings, gas works, supplies\r\nof food, sanitary arrangements, etc.; federations of communes among\r\nthemselves, and federations of communes with trade organizations; and\r\nfinally, wider groups covering the country, or several countries,\r\ncomposed of men who collaborate for the satisfaction of such economic,\r\nintellectual, artistic, and moral needs as are not limited to a given\r\nterritory. All these will combine directly, by means of free agreements\r\nbetween them, just as the railway companies or the postal departments\r\nof different countries co-operate now, without having a central railway\r\nor postal government, even though the former are actuated by merely\r\negoistic aims and the latter belong to different and often hostile\r\nStates; or as the meteorologists, the Alpine clubs, the lifeboat\r\nstations in Great Britain, the cyclists, the teachers, and so on,\r\ncombine for all sorts of work in common, for intellectual pursuits, or\r\nsimply for pleasure. There will be full freedom for the development\r\nof new forms of production, invention, and organization; individual\r\ninitiative will be encouraged, and the tendency toward uniformity and\r\ncentralization will be discouraged.\r\n\r\nMoreover, this society will not be crystallized into certain\r\nunchangeable forms, but will continually modify its aspect, because it\r\nwill be a living, evolving organism; no need of government will be\r\nfelt, because free agreement and federation can take its place in all\r\nthose functions which governments consider as theirs at the present\r\ntime, and because, the causes of conflict being reduced in number,\r\nthose conflicts which may still arise can be submitted to arbitration.\r\n\r\nNone of us minimized the importance and depth of the change which we\r\nlooked for. We understood that the current opinions upon the necessity\r\nof private ownership in land, factories, mines, dwelling houses, and so\r\non, as a means of securing industrial progress, and of the wage-system\r\nas a means of compelling men to work, would not soon give way to higher\r\nconceptions of socialized ownership and production. We knew that a\r\ntedious propaganda and a long succession of struggles, individual and\r\ncollective revolts against the now prevailing forms of property, of\r\nindividual self-sacrifice, of partial attempts at reconstruction and\r\npartial revolutions would have to be lived through, before the current\r\nideas upon private ownership would be modified. And we understood also\r\nthat the now current ideas concerning the necessity of authority--in\r\nwhich all of us have been bred--would not and could not be abandoned\r\nby civilized mankind all at once. Long years of propaganda and a long\r\nsuccession of partial acts of revolt against authority, as well as a\r\ncomplete revision of the teachings now derived from history, would\r\nbe required before men could perceive that they had been mistaken in\r\nattributing to their rulers and their laws what was derived in reality\r\nfrom their own sociable feelings and habits. We knew all that. But we\r\nalso knew that in preaching change in both these directions we should\r\nbe working with the tide of human progress.\r\n\r\nWhen I made a closer acquaintance with the working population and their\r\nsympathizers from the better educated classes, I soon realized that\r\nthey valued their personal freedom even more than they valued their\r\npersonal well-being. Fifty years ago the workers were ready to sell\r\ntheir personal liberty to all sorts of rulers, and even to a Cæsar,\r\nin exchange for a promise of material well-being, but now this was no\r\nlonger the case. I saw that the blind faith in elected rulers, even if\r\nthey were taken from amongst the best leaders of the labour movement,\r\nwas dying away amongst the Latin workers. ‘We must know first what we\r\nwant, and then we can do it best ourselves,’ was an idea which I found\r\nwidely spread among them--far more widely than is generally believed.\r\nThe sentence which was put in the statutes of the International\r\nAssociation: ‘The emancipation of the workers must be accomplished by\r\nthe workers themselves,’ had met with general sympathy and had taken\r\nroot in minds. The sad experience of the Paris Commune only confirmed\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWhen the insurrection broke out, considerable numbers of men belonging\r\nto the middle classes themselves were prepared to make, or at least\r\nto accept, a new start in the social direction. ‘When my brother and\r\nmyself, coming out of our little room, went out in the streets,’\r\nElisée Reclus said to me once, ‘we were asked on all sides by people\r\nbelonging to the wealthier classes: “Tell us what is to be done? We are\r\nready to try a new start;” but _we_ were not prepared yet to make the\r\nsuggestions.’\r\n\r\nNever before had a government been as fairly representative of all the\r\nadvanced parties as the Council of the Commune, elected on March 25,\r\n1871. All shades of revolutionary opinion--Blanquists, Jacobinists,\r\nInternationalists--were represented in it in a true proportion. And yet\r\nthe workers themselves, having no distinct ideas of social reform to\r\nimpress upon their representatives, the Commune Government did nothing\r\nin that direction. The very fact of having been isolated from the\r\nmasses and shut up in the Hôtel de Ville paralysed them. For the very\r\nsuccess of socialism, the ideas of no-government, of self-reliance, of\r\nfree initiative of the individual--of anarchism, in a word--had thus\r\nto be preached side by side with those of socialized ownership and\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nWe certainly foresaw that if full freedom is left to the individual\r\nfor the expression of his ideas and for action, we should have to face\r\na certain amount of extravagant exaggerations of our principles. I\r\nhad seen it in the Nihilist movement in Russia. But we trusted--and\r\nexperience has proved that we were right--that social life itself,\r\nsupported by a frank, open-minded criticism of opinions and actions,\r\nwould be the most effective means for threshing out opinions and for\r\ndivesting them of the unavoidable exaggerations. We acted, in fact, in\r\naccordance with the old saying that freedom remains still the wisest\r\ncure for freedom’s temporary inconveniences. There is, in mankind, a\r\nnucleus of social habits, an inheritance from the past, not yet duly\r\nappreciated, which is _not_ maintained by coercion and is superior to\r\ncoercion. Upon it all the progress of mankind is based, and so long as\r\nmankind does not begin to deteriorate physically and mentally, it will\r\nnot be destroyed by any amount of criticism or of occasional revolt\r\nagainst it. These were the opinions in which I grew confirmed more and\r\nmore in proportion as my experience of men and things increased.\r\n\r\nWe understood, at the same time, that such a change cannot be produced\r\nby the conjectures of one man of genius, that it will not be one man’s\r\ndiscovery, but that it must result from the constructive work of the\r\nmasses, just as the forms of judicial procedure which were elaborated\r\nin the early mediæval ages, the village community, the guild, the\r\nmediæval city, or the foundations of international law, were worked out\r\nby the people.\r\n\r\nMany of our predecessors had undertaken to picture ideal commonwealths,\r\nbasing them upon the principle of authority, or, on some rare\r\noccasions, upon the principle of freedom. Robert Owen and Fourier had\r\ngiven the world their ideals of a free, organically developing society,\r\nin opposition to the pyramidal ideals which had been copied from the\r\nRoman Empire or from the Roman Church. Proudhon had continued their\r\nwork, and Bakúnin, applying his wide and clear understanding of the\r\nphilosophy of history to the criticism of present institutions, ‘built\r\nup while he was demolishing.’ But all that was only preparatory work.\r\n\r\nThe International Workingmen’s Association inaugurated a new method of\r\nsolving the problems of practical sociology by appealing to the workers\r\nthemselves. The educated men who had joined the association undertook\r\nonly to enlighten the workers as to what was going on in different\r\ncountries of the world to analyse the obtained results, and, later on,\r\nto aid the workers in formulating their conclusions. We did not pretend\r\nto evolve an ideal commonwealth out of our theoretical views as to what\r\na society _ought to be_, but we invited the workers to investigate the\r\ncauses of the present evils, and in their discussions and congresses\r\nto consider the practical aspects of a better social organization than\r\nthe one we live in. A question raised at an international congress was\r\nrecommended as a subject of study to all labour unions. In the course\r\nof the year it was discussed all over Europe, in the small meetings of\r\nthe sections, with a full knowledge of the local needs of each trade\r\nand each locality; then the work of the sections was brought before the\r\nnext congress of each federation, and finally it was submitted in a\r\nmore elaborate form to the next international congress. The structure\r\nof the society which we longed for was thus worked out, in theory and\r\npractice, from beneath, and the Jura Federation took a large part in\r\nthat elaboration of the anarchist ideal.\r\n\r\nFor myself, placed as I was in such favourable conditions, I gradually\r\ncame to realize that anarchism represents more than a mere mode of\r\naction and a mere conception of a free society; that it is part of a\r\nphilosophy, natural and social, which must be developed in a quite\r\ndifferent way from the metaphysical or dialectic methods which have\r\nbeen employed in sciences dealing with man. I saw that it must be\r\ntreated by the same methods as natural sciences; not, however, on the\r\nslippery ground of mere analogies, such as Herbert Spencer accepts, but\r\non the solid basis of induction applied to human institutions. And I\r\ndid my best to accomplish what I could in that direction.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTwo congresses were held in the autumn of 1877 in Belgium: one of the\r\nInternational Workingmen’s Association at Verviers, and the other an\r\nInternational Socialist congress at Ghent. The latter was especially\r\nimportant, as it was known that an attempt would be made by the\r\nGerman social democrats to bring all the labour movement of Europe\r\nunder one organization, subject to a central committee, which would\r\nbe the old general council of the International under a new name.\r\nIt was therefore necessary to preserve the autonomy of the labour\r\norganizations in the Latin countries, and we did our best to be well\r\nrepresented at this congress. I went under the name of Levashóff; two\r\nGermans, the compositor Werner and the engineer Rinke, walked nearly\r\nall the distance from Basel to Belgium; and although we were only nine\r\nanarchists at Ghent, we succeeded in checking the centralization scheme.\r\n\r\nTwenty-two years have passed since; a number of International Socialist\r\ncongresses have been held, and at every one of them the same struggle\r\nhas been renewed--the social democrats trying to enlist all the\r\nlabour movement of Europe under their banner and to bring it under\r\ntheir control, and the anarchists opposing and preventing it. What an\r\namount of wasted force, of bitter words exchanged and efforts divided,\r\nsimply because those who have adopted the formula of ‘conquest of\r\npower within the existing states’ do not understand that activity in\r\nthis direction cannot embody all the socialist movement! From the\r\noutset socialism took three independent lines of development, which\r\nfound their expression in Saint-Simon, Fourier, and Robert Owen.\r\nSaint-Simonism has developed into social democracy, and Fourierism into\r\nanarchism; while Owenism is developing, in England and America, into\r\ntrade-unionism, co-operation, and the so-called municipal socialism,\r\nand remains hostile to social democratic state socialism, while it\r\nhas many points of contact with anarchism. But because of failure to\r\nrecognize that the three march toward a common goal in three different\r\nways, and that the two latter bring their own precious contribution to\r\nhuman progress, a quarter of a century has been given to endeavours\r\nto realize the unrealizable Utopia of a unique labour movement of the\r\nsocial democratic pattern.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Ghent congress ended for me in an unexpected way. Three or four\r\ndays after it had begun, the Belgian police learned who Levashóff was,\r\nand received the order to arrest me for a breach of police regulations\r\nwhich I had committed in giving at the hotel an assumed name. My\r\nBelgian friends warned me. They maintained that the clerical ministry\r\nwhich was in power was capable of giving me up to Russia, and insisted\r\nupon my leaving the congress at once. They would not let me return to\r\nthe hotel; Guillaume barred the way, telling me that I should have to\r\nuse force against him if I insisted upon returning thither. I had to go\r\nwith some Ghent comrades, and as soon as I joined them, muffled calls\r\nand whistling came from all corners of a dark square over which groups\r\nof workers were scattered. It all looked awfully mysterious. At last,\r\nafter much whispering and subdued whistling, a group of comrades took\r\nme under escort to a social democrat worker, with whom I had to spend\r\nthe night, and who received me, anarchist though I was, in the most\r\ntouching way as a brother. Next morning I left once more for England,\r\non board a steamer, provoking a number of good-natured smiles from the\r\nBritish custom-house officers, who wanted me to show them my luggage,\r\nwhile I had nothing to show but a small hand-bag.\r\n\r\nI did not stay long in London. In the admirable collections of the\r\nBritish Museum I studied the beginnings of the French Revolution--how\r\nrevolutions come to break out; but I wanted more activity, and soon\r\nwent to Paris. A revival of the labour movement was beginning there,\r\nafter the rigid suppression of the Commune. With the Italian Costa and\r\nthe few anarchist friends we had among the Paris workers, and with\r\nJules Guesde and his colleagues who were not strict social democrats at\r\nthat time, we started the first socialist groups.\r\n\r\nOur beginnings were ridiculously small. Half a dozen of us used to\r\nmeet in cafés, and when we had an audience of a hundred persons at a\r\nmeeting we felt happy. No one would have guessed then that two years\r\nlater the movement would be in full swing. But France has its own ways\r\nof development. When a reaction has gained the upper hand, all visible\r\ntraces of a movement disappear. Those who fight against the current are\r\nfew. But in some mysterious way, by a sort of invisible infiltration\r\nof ideas, the reaction is undermined; a new current sets in, and then\r\nit appears, all of a sudden, that the idea which was thought to be\r\ndead was there alive, spreading and growing all the time; and as soon\r\nas public agitation becomes possible, thousands of adherents, whose\r\nexistence nobody suspected, come to the front. ‘There are at Paris,’\r\nold Blanqui used to say, ‘fifty thousand men who never come to a\r\nmeeting or to a demonstration; but the moment they feel that the people\r\ncan appear in the streets to manifest their opinion, they are there to\r\nstorm the position.’ So it was then. There were not twenty of us to\r\ncarry on the movement, not two hundred openly to support it. At the\r\nfirst commemoration of the Commune, in March 1878, we surely were not\r\ntwo hundred. But two years later the amnesty for the Commune was voted,\r\nand the working population of Paris was in the streets to greet the\r\nreturning Communards; it flocked by the thousand to cheer them at the\r\nmeetings, and the socialist movement took a sudden expansion, carrying\r\nwith it the Radicals.\r\n\r\nThe time had not yet come for that revival, however, and one\r\nnight, in April 1878, Costa and a French comrade were arrested. A\r\npolice-court condemned them to imprisonment for eighteen months as\r\nInternationalists. I escaped arrest only by mistake. The police wanted\r\nLevashóff, and went to arrest a Russian student whose name sounded\r\nvery much like that. I had given my real name, and continued to stay\r\nat Paris under that name for another month. Then I was called to\r\nSwitzerland.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nDuring this stay at Paris I made my first acquaintance with Turguéneff.\r\nHe had expressed to our common friend, P. L. Lavróff, the desire to see\r\nme, and, as a true Russian, to celebrate my escape by a small friendly\r\ndinner. It was with almost a feeling of worship that I crossed the\r\nthreshold of his room. If by his ‘Sportsman’s Notebook’ he rendered\r\nto Russia the immense service of throwing odium upon serfdom (I did\r\nnot know at that time that he took a leading part in Hérzen’s powerful\r\n‘Bell’), he has rendered no less service through his later novels. He\r\nhas shown what the Russian woman is, what treasuries of mind and heart\r\nshe possesses, what she may be as an inspirer of men; and he has taught\r\nus how men who have a real claim to superiority look upon women, how\r\nthey love. Upon me, and upon thousands of my contemporaries, this part\r\nof his teaching made an indelible impression, far more powerful than\r\nthe best articles upon women’s rights.\r\n\r\nHis appearance is well known. Tall, strongly built, the head covered\r\nwith soft and thick grey hair, he was certainly beautiful; his eyes\r\ngleamed with intelligence, not devoid of a touch of humour, and his\r\nwhole manner testified to that simplicity and absence of affectation\r\nwhich are characteristic of the best Russian writers. His fine head\r\nrevealed a vast development of brain power, and when he died, and Paul\r\nBert, with Paul Reclus (the surgeon), weighed his brain, it so much\r\nsurpassed the heaviest brain then known--that of Cuvier--reaching\r\nsomething over two thousand grammes, that they would not trust to their\r\nscales, but got new ones, to repeat the weighing.\r\n\r\nHis talk was especially remarkable. He spoke, as he wrote, in images.\r\nWhen he wanted to develop an idea, he did not resort to arguments,\r\nalthough he was a master in philosophical discussions; he illustrated\r\nhis idea by a scene presented in a form as beautiful as if it had been\r\ntaken out of one of his novels.\r\n\r\n‘You must have had a great deal of experience in your life amongst\r\nFrenchmen, Germans, and other peoples,’ he said to me once. ‘Have you\r\nnot remarked that there is a deep, unfathomable chasm between many of\r\ntheir conceptions and the views which we Russians hold on the same\r\nsubjects--points upon which we can never agree?’\r\n\r\nI replied that I had not noticed such points.\r\n\r\n‘Yes, there are some. Here is one of them. One night, we were at the\r\nfirst representation of a new play. I was in a box with Flaubert,\r\nDaudet, Zola.... (I am not quite sure whether he named both Daudet and\r\nZola, but he certainly named one of the two.) All were men of advanced\r\nopinions. The subject of the play was this: A woman had separated from\r\nher husband. She had had a new love and had settled with another man.\r\nThis man was represented in the play as an excellent person. For years\r\nthey had been quite happy. Her two children--a girl and a boy--were\r\nbabies at the moment of the separation; now, they had grown, and\r\nthroughout all these years they had considered the man as their real\r\nfather. The girl was about eighteen and the boy about seventeen. The\r\nman treated them quite as a father, they loved him, and he loved them.\r\nThe scene represented the family meeting at breakfast. The girl comes\r\nin, approaches her supposed father, and he is going to kiss her--when\r\nthe boy, who has learned in some way that they are not his children,\r\nrushes forward towards him, and shouts out: “Don’t dare!” _N’osez pas!_\r\n\r\n‘The hall was brought down by this exclamation. There was an outburst\r\nof frantic applause. Flaubert and the others joined in it. I was\r\ndisgusted. “Why,” I said, “this family was happy; the man was a better\r\nfather to these children than their real father, ... their mother loved\r\nhim and was happy with him.... This mischievous, perverted boy ought\r\nsimply to be flogged for what he has said....” It was of no use. I\r\ndiscussed for hours with them afterwards: none of them could understand\r\nme!’\r\n\r\nI was, of course, fully in accord with Turguéneff’s point of view. I\r\nremarked, however, that his acquaintances were chiefly amongst the\r\nmiddle classes. There the difference from nation to nation is immense\r\nindeed. But my acquaintances were exclusively amongst the workers, and\r\nthere is an immense resemblance between the workers, and especially\r\namongst the peasants, of all nations.\r\n\r\nIn so saying, I was, however, quite wrong. After I had had the\r\nopportunity of making a closer acquaintance with French workers, I\r\noften thought of the rightness of Turguéneff’s remark. There is a real\r\nchasm indeed between the conceptions which prevail in Russia upon\r\nmarriage relations and those which prevail in France: amongst the\r\nworkers as well as in the middle classes; and upon many other points\r\nthere is almost the same chasm between the Russian point of view and\r\nthat of other nations.\r\n\r\nIt was said somewhere, after Turguéneff’s death, that he intended to\r\nwrite a novel upon this subject. If it was begun, the above mentioned\r\nscene must be in his manuscript. What a pity that he did not write that\r\nnovel! He, a thorough ‘Occidental’ in his ways of thinking, could have\r\nsaid very deep things upon a subject which must have so deeply affected\r\nhim personally throughout his life.\r\n\r\nOf all novel-writers of our century, Turguéneff has certainly attained\r\nthe greatest perfection as an artist, and his prose sounds to the\r\nRussian ear like music--music as deep as that of Beethoven. His\r\nprincipal novels--the series of ‘Dmítri Rúdin,’ ‘A Nobleman’s Retreat,’\r\n‘On the Eve,’ ‘Fathers and Sons,’ ‘Smoke,’ and ‘Virgin Soil’--represent\r\nthe leading ‘history-making’ types of the educated classes of Russia,\r\nwhich evolved in rapid succession after 1848; all sketched with a\r\nfulness of philosophical conception and humanitarian understanding and\r\nan artistic beauty which have no parallel in any other literature. Yet\r\n‘Fathers and Sons’--a novel which he rightly considered his profoundest\r\nwork--was received by the young people of Russia with a loud protest.\r\nOur youth declared that the Nihilist Bazároff was by no means a true\r\nrepresentation of his class; many described him even as a caricature\r\nof Nihilism. This misunderstanding deeply affected Turguéneff, and,\r\nalthough a reconciliation between him and the young generation took\r\nplace later on at St. Petersburg, after he had written ‘Virgin Soil,’\r\nthe wound inflicted upon him by these attacks was never healed.\r\n\r\nHe knew from Lavróff that I was an enthusiastic admirer of his\r\nwritings; and one day, as we were returning in a carriage from a visit\r\nto Antokólsky’s studio, he asked me what I thought of Bazároff. I\r\nfrankly replied, ‘Bazároff is an admirable painting of the Nihilist,\r\nbut one feels that you did not love him as much as you did your other\r\nheroes.’ ‘On the contrary, I loved him, intensely loved him,’ Turguéneff\r\nreplied, with unexpected vigour. ‘When we get home I will show you my\r\ndiary, in which I have noted how I wept when I had ended the novel with\r\nBazároff’s death.’\r\n\r\nTurguéneff certainly loved the intellectual aspect of Bazároff. He so\r\nidentified himself with the Nihilist philosophy of his hero that he\r\neven kept a diary in his name, appreciating the current events from\r\nBazároff’s point of view. But I think that he admired him more than he\r\nloved him. In a brilliant lecture on Hamlet and Don Quixote, he divided\r\nthe history-makers of mankind into two classes, represented by one or\r\nthe other of these characters. ‘Analysis first of all, and then egoism,\r\nand therefore no faith--an egoist cannot even believe in himself:’ so\r\nhe characterized Hamlet. ‘Therefore he is a sceptic, and never will\r\nachieve anything; while Don Quixote, who fights against windmills, and\r\ntakes a barber’s plate for the magic helmet of Mambrin (who of us has\r\nnever made the same mistake?), is a leader of the masses, because the\r\nmasses always follow those who, taking no heed of the sarcasms of the\r\nmajority, or even of persecutions, march straight forward, keeping\r\ntheir eyes fixed upon a goal which they may be alone to see. They\r\nsearch, they fall, but they rise again, and find it--and by right, too.\r\nYet, although Hamlet is a sceptic, and disbelieves in Good, he does\r\nnot disbelieve in Evil. He hates it; Evil and Deceit are his enemies;\r\nand his scepticism is not indifferentism, but only negation and doubt,\r\nwhich finally consume his will.’\r\n\r\nThese thoughts of Turguéneff give, I think, the true key for\r\nunderstanding his relations to his heroes. He himself and several of\r\nhis best friends belonged more or less to the Hamlets. He loved Hamlet,\r\nand admired Don Quixote. So he admired also Bazároff. He represented\r\nhis superiority admirably well: he understood the tragic character of\r\nhis isolated position; but he could not surround him with that tender,\r\npoetical love which he bestowed, as on a sick friend, when his heroes\r\napproached the Hamlet type. It would have been out of place.\r\n\r\n‘Did you know Mýshkin?’ he once asked me, in 1878. At the trial of our\r\ncircle Mýshkin revealed himself as the most powerful personality. ‘I\r\nshould like to know all about him,’ he continued. ‘That _is_ a man; not\r\nthe slightest trace of Hamletism.’ And in so saying he was obviously\r\nmeditating on this new type in the Russian movement, which did not\r\nexist in the phase that Turguéneff described in ‘Virgin Soil,’ but was\r\nto appear two years later.\r\n\r\nI saw him for the last time in the autumn of 1881. He was very ill,\r\nand worried by the thought that it was his duty to write to Alexander\r\nIII.--who had just come to the throne, and hesitated as to the policy\r\nhe should follow--asking him to give Russia a constitution, and\r\nproving to him by solid arguments the necessity of that step. With\r\nevident grief he said to me: ‘I feel that I must do it, but I feel I\r\nshall not be able to do it.’ In fact, he was already suffering awful\r\npains occasioned by a cancer in the spinal cord, and had the greatest\r\ndifficulty even in sitting up and talking for a few moments. He did not\r\nwrite then, and a few weeks later it would have been useless. Alexander\r\nIII. had announced in a manifesto his intention to remain the absolute\r\nruler of Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nIn the meantime affairs in Russia took quite a new turn. The war\r\nwhich Russia began against Turkey in 1877 had ended in general\r\ndisappointment. There was in the country, before the war broke out, a\r\ngreat deal of enthusiasm in favour of the Slavonians. Many believed,\r\nalso, that the war of liberation in the Balkans would result in a move\r\nin the progressive direction in Russia itself. But the liberation\r\nof the Slavonian populations was only partly accomplished. The\r\ntremendous sacrifices which had been made by the Russians were rendered\r\nineffectual by the blunders of the higher military authorities.\r\nHundreds of thousands of men had been slaughtered in battles which\r\nwere only half victories, and the concessions wrested from Turkey were\r\nbrought to naught at the Berlin Congress. It was also widely known that\r\nthe embezzlement of State money went on during this war on almost as\r\nlarge a scale as during the Crimean war.\r\n\r\nIt was amidst the general dissatisfaction which prevailed in Russia\r\nat the end of 1877, that one hundred and ninety-three persons,\r\narrested since 1873, in connection with our agitation, were brought\r\nbefore a high court. The accused, supported by a number of lawyers\r\nof talent, won at once the sympathies of the public. They produced\r\na very favourable impression upon St. Petersburg society; and when\r\nit became known that most of them had spent three or four years in\r\nprison, waiting for this trial, and that no less than twenty-one of\r\nthem had either put an end to their lives by suicide or become insane,\r\nthe feeling grew still stronger in their favour, even among the judges\r\nthemselves. The court pronounced very heavy sentences upon a few, and\r\nrelatively lenient ones upon the remainder; saying that the preliminary\r\ndetention had lasted so long, and was so hard a punishment in itself,\r\nthat nothing could justly be added to it. It was confidently expected\r\nthat the Emperor would still further mitigate the sentences. It\r\nhappened, however, to the astonishment of all, that he revised the\r\nsentences only to increase them. Those whom the court had acquitted\r\nwere sent into exile in remote parts of Russia and Siberia, and from\r\nfive to twelve years of hard labour were inflicted upon those whom the\r\ncourt had condemned to short terms of imprisonment. This was the work\r\nof the chief of the Third Section, General Mézentsoff.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the chief of the St. Petersburg police, General\r\nTrépoff, noticing, during a visit to the house of detention, that one\r\nof the political prisoners, Bogolúboff, did not take off his hat to\r\ngreet the omnipotent satrap, rushed upon him, gave him a blow, and,\r\nwhen the prisoner resisted, ordered him to be flogged. The other\r\nprisoners, learning the fact in their cells, loudly expressed their\r\nindignation, and were in consequence fearfully beaten by the warders\r\nand the police. The Russian political prisoners bore without murmuring\r\nall hardships inflicted upon them in Siberia, or through hard labour,\r\nbut they were firmly decided not to tolerate corporal punishment. A\r\nyoung girl, Véra Zasúlich, who did not even personally know Bogolúboff,\r\ntook a revolver, went to the chief of police, and shot at him. Trépoff\r\nwas only wounded. Alexander II. came to look at the heroic girl, who\r\nmust have impressed him by her extremely sweet face and her modesty.\r\nTrépoff had so many enemies at St. Petersburg that they managed to\r\nbring the affair before a common-law jury, and Véra Zasúlich declared\r\nin court that she had resorted to arms only when all means for bringing\r\nthe affair to public knowledge and obtaining some sort of redress had\r\nbeen exhausted. Even the St. Petersburg correspondent of the London\r\n‘Times,’ who had been asked to mention the affair in his paper, had not\r\ndone so, perhaps thinking it improbable. Then, without telling anyone\r\nabout her intentions, she went to shoot Trépoff. Now that the affair\r\nhad become public, she was quite happy to know that he was but slightly\r\nwounded. The jury acquitted her unanimously; and when the police tried\r\nto rearrest her, as she was leaving the court-house, the young men of\r\nSt. Petersburg, who stood in crowds at the gates, saved her from their\r\nclutches. She went abroad, and soon was among us in Switzerland.\r\n\r\nThis affair produced quite a sensation throughout Europe. I was at\r\nParis when the news of the acquittal came, and had to call that day\r\non business at the offices of several newspapers. I found the editors\r\nglowing with enthusiasm, and writing forcible articles in honour of\r\nthis Russian girl. Even the ‘Revue des Deux Mondes,’ in its review of\r\nthe year 1878, declared that the two persons who had most impressed\r\npublic opinion in Europe during the year were Prince Gortchakóff at\r\nthe Berlin Congress and Véra Zasúlich. Their portraits were given side\r\nby side in several almanacs. Upon the workers of Western Europe the\r\ndevotion of Véra Zasúlich produced a profound impression.\r\n\r\nDuring the same year, 1878, without any plot having been formed, four\r\nattempts were made against crowned heads in close succession. The\r\nworkman Hoedel, and after him Dr. Nobiling, shot at the German Emperor;\r\na few weeks later, a Spanish workman, Oliva Moncási, followed with an\r\nattempt to shoot the King of Spain, and the cook Passanante rushed\r\nwith his knife upon the King of Italy. The governments of Europe could\r\nnot believe that such attempts upon the lives of three kings should\r\nhave occurred without there being at the bottom some international\r\nconspiracy, and they jumped to the conclusion that the anarchist Jura\r\nFederation was the centre of that conspiracy.\r\n\r\nMore than twenty years have passed since then, and I can say most\r\npositively that there was absolutely no ground whatever for such\r\na supposition. However, all the European governments fell upon\r\nSwitzerland, reproaching her with harbouring revolutionists who\r\norganized such plots. Paul Brousse, the editor of our Jura newspaper,\r\nthe ‘Avant-Garde,’ was arrested and prosecuted. The Swiss judges,\r\nseeing there was not the slightest foundation for connecting Brousse\r\nor the Jura Federation with the recent attempts, condemned Brousse to\r\nonly a couple of months’ imprisonment for his articles; but the paper\r\nwas suppressed, and all the printing offices of Switzerland were asked\r\nby the federal government not to publish this or any similar paper. The\r\nJura Federation was thus silenced.\r\n\r\nBesides, the politicians of Switzerland, who looked with an\r\nunfavourable eye on the anarchist agitation in their country, acted\r\nprivately in such a way as to compel the leading Swiss members of\r\nthe Jura Federation either to retire from public life or to starve.\r\nBrousse was expelled from Switzerland. James Guillaume, who for eight\r\nyears had maintained against all obstacles the ‘Bulletin’ of the\r\nfederation, and made his living chiefly by teaching, could obtain\r\nno employment, and was compelled to leave Switzerland and remove\r\nto France. Adhémar Schwitzguébel, boycotted in the watch trade and\r\nburdened by a large family, had finally to retire from the movement.\r\nSpichiger was in the same condition, and emigrated. It thus happened\r\nthat I, a foreigner, had to undertake the editing of a paper for the\r\nfederation. I hesitated, of course, but there was nothing else to\r\nbe done, and with two friends, Dumartheray and Herzig, I started a\r\nnew fortnightly at Geneva, in February 1879, under the title of ‘Le\r\nRévolté.’ I had to write most of it myself. We had only twenty-three\r\nfrancs to start the paper, but we all set to work to get subscriptions,\r\nand succeeded in issuing our first number. It was moderate in tone, but\r\nrevolutionary in substance, and I did my best to write it in such a\r\nstyle that complicated historical and economical questions should be\r\ncomprehensible to every intelligent worker. Six hundred was the utmost\r\nlimit which the edition of our previous papers had ever attained. We\r\nprinted two thousand copies of ‘Le Révolté,’ and in a few days not one\r\nwas left. It was a success, and it still continues, at Paris, under the\r\ntitle of ‘Temps Nouveaux.’\r\n\r\nSocialist newspapers have often a tendency to become mere annals of\r\ncomplaints about existing conditions. The oppression of the workers\r\nin the mine, the factory, and the field is related; the misery and\r\nsufferings of the workers during strikes are told in vivid pictures;\r\ntheir helplessness in the struggle against their employers is\r\ninsisted upon; and this succession of hopeless efforts, described\r\nevery week, exercises a most depressing influence upon the reader. To\r\ncounterbalance that effect, the editor has to rely chiefly upon burning\r\nwords, by means of which he tries to inspire his readers with energy\r\nand faith. I thought, on the contrary, that a revolutionary paper must\r\nbe, above all, a record of those symptoms which everywhere announce\r\nthe coming of a new era, the germination of new forms of social life,\r\nthe growing revolt against antiquated institutions. These symptoms\r\nshould be watched, brought together in their intimate connection, and\r\nso grouped as to show to the hesitating minds of the greater number\r\nthe invisible and often unconscious support which advanced ideas find\r\neverywhere, when a revival of thought takes place in society. To make\r\none feel in sympathy with the throbbing of the human heart all over the\r\nworld, with its revolt against age-long injustice, with its attempts\r\nat working out new forms of life--this should be the chief duty of a\r\nrevolutionary paper. It is hope, not despair, which makes successful\r\nrevolutions.\r\n\r\nHistorians often tell us how this or that system of philosophy has\r\naccomplished a certain change in human thought, and subsequently in\r\ninstitutions. But this is not history. The greatest social philosophers\r\nhave only caught the indications of coming changes, have understood\r\ntheir inner relations, and, aided by induction and intuition, have\r\nforetold what was to occur. Sociologists have also drawn plans of\r\nsocial organizations, by starting from a few principles and developing\r\nthem to their necessary consequences, like a geometrical conclusion\r\nfrom a few axioms; but this is not sociology. A correct social forecast\r\ncannot be made unless one keeps an eye on the thousands of signs of\r\nthe new life, separating the occasional facts from those which are\r\norganically essential, and building the generalization upon that basis.\r\n\r\nThis was the method of thought with which I endeavoured to familiarize\r\nour readers--using plain comprehensible words, so as to accustom the\r\nmost modest of them to judge for himself whereunto society is moving,\r\nand himself to correct the thinker if the latter comes to wrong\r\nconclusions. As to the criticism of what exists, I went into it only to\r\ndisentangle the roots of the evils, and to show that a deep-seated and\r\ncarefully-nurtured fetishism with regard to the antiquated survivals of\r\npast phases of human development, and a widespread cowardice of mind\r\nand will, are the main sources of all evils.\r\n\r\nDumartheray and Herzig gave me full support in that direction.\r\nDumartheray was born in one of the poorest peasant families in Savoy.\r\nHis schooling had not gone beyond the first rudiments of a primary\r\nschool. Yet he was one of the most intelligent men I ever met. His\r\nappreciations of current events and men were so remarkable for their\r\nuncommon good sense that they were often prophetic. He was also one of\r\nthe finest critics of the current socialist literature, and was never\r\ntaken in by the mere display of fine words, or would-be science. Herzig\r\nwas a young clerk, born at Geneva; a man of suppressed emotions, shy,\r\nwho would blush like a girl when he expressed an original thought,\r\nand who, after I was arrested, when he became responsible for the\r\ncontinuance of the journal, by sheer force of will learned to write\r\nvery well. Boycotted by all Geneva employers, and fallen with his\r\nfamily into sheer misery, he nevertheless supported the paper till it\r\nbecame possible to transfer it to Paris.\r\n\r\nTo the judgment of these two friends I could trust implicitly. If\r\nHerzig frowned, muttering, ‘Yes--well--it may go,’ I knew that it would\r\nnot do. And when Dumartheray, who always complained of the bad state\r\nof his spectacles when he had to read a not quite legibly written\r\nmanuscript, and therefore generally read proofs only, interrupted his\r\nreading by exclaiming, ‘Non, ça ne va pas!’ I felt at once that it was\r\nnot the proper thing, and tried to guess what thought or expression\r\nprovoked his disapproval. I knew there was no use asking him, ‘Why will\r\nit not do?’ He would have answered: ‘Ah, that it not my affair; that’s\r\nyours. It won’t do; that is all I can say.’ But I felt he was right,\r\nand I simply sat down to rewrite the passage, or, taking the composing\r\nstick, set up in type a new passage instead.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI must own that we had also hard times with our paper. No sooner had\r\nwe issued five numbers than the printer asked us to find another\r\nprinting office. For the workers and their publications the liberty\r\nof the Press inscribed in the Constitutions has many limitations\r\nbeside the paragraphs of the law. The printer had no objection to our\r\npaper--he liked it; but in Switzerland all printing offices depend\r\nupon the government, which employs them more or less in issuing\r\nstatistical reports and the like; and our printer was plainly told\r\nthat if he continued to harbour our paper he need not expect to have\r\nany more orders from the Geneva government. I made the tour of all\r\nthe French-speaking part of Switzerland and saw the heads of all the\r\nprinting offices, but everywhere, even from those who did not dislike\r\nthe tendency of the paper, I received the same reply: ‘We could not\r\nlive without orders from the government, and we should have none if we\r\nundertook to print “Le Révolté.”’\r\n\r\nI returned to Geneva in very low spirits, but Dumartheray was only\r\nthe more ardent and hopeful. ‘It’s all very simple,’ he said. ‘We buy\r\nour own printing plant on a three months’ credit, and in three months\r\nwe shall have paid it.’ ‘But we have no money, only a few hundred\r\nfrancs,’ I objected. ‘Money? nonsense! We _shall_ have it! Let us\r\nonly order the type at once and immediately issue our next number and\r\nmoney will come!’ Once more he had judged quite right. When our next\r\nnumber came out from our own _Imprimerie Jurassienne_, and we had told\r\nour difficulties and issued a couple of small pamphlets besides--all\r\nof us helping in the printing--the money came in, mostly in coppers\r\nand silver, but it came. Over and over again in my life I have heard\r\ncomplaints among the advanced parties about the want of money, but\r\nthe longer I live the more I am persuaded that our chief difficulty\r\ndoes not lie so much in money as in _men_ who would march firmly and\r\nsteadily towards a given aim in the right direction and inspire others.\r\nFor twenty-one years our paper has now continued to live from hand to\r\nmouth, appeals for funds appearing on the front page almost in every\r\nnumber; but as long as there is a man who sticks to it and puts all\r\nhis energy into it, as Herzig and Dumartheray did at Geneva, and Grave\r\nhas done for the last sixteen years at Paris, the money comes in and\r\nthe printing expenses are more or less covered, mainly by the pennies\r\nof the workers. For a paper, as for everything else, men are of an\r\ninfinitely greater value than money.\r\n\r\nWe started our printing office in a tiny room, and our compositor was\r\na Little Russian, who undertook to put our paper in type for the very\r\nmodest sum of sixty francs a month. So long as he had his plain dinner\r\nevery day, and the possibility of going occasionally to the opera, he\r\ncared for nothing more. ‘Going to the Turkish bath, John?’ I asked him\r\nonce as I met him at Geneva in the street, with a brown paper parcel\r\nunder his arm. ‘No, removing to a new lodging,’ he replied in his\r\nmelodious voice, with his usual smile.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, he knew no French. I used to write my manuscript to the\r\nbest of my caligraphic ability--often thinking with regret of the time\r\nI had wasted in the writing classes of our good Ebert at school--but\r\nJohn would read a French manuscript in the most fantastical way, and\r\nwould set up in type the most extraordinary words of his own invention;\r\nbut as he ‘kept the space,’ and the length of his lines had not to be\r\naltered for making the corrections, there were only a dozen letters in\r\neach line to be changed, and we managed to do it pretty well. We were\r\non excellent terms with him, and I soon learned some ‘comping’ under\r\nhis direction. The paper was always ready in time to take the proofs\r\nto a Swiss comrade who was the responsible editor, and to whom we\r\npedantically submitted them before going to print, and then one of us\r\ncarted the formes to a printing office. Our _Imprimerie Jurassienne_\r\nsoon became widely known for its publications, especially for its\r\npamphlets, which Dumartheray insisted upon never selling at more than\r\none penny. Quite a new style had to be worked out for such pamphlets.\r\nI must say that I often had the wickedness of envying those writers\r\nwho could use any amount of pages for developing their ideas, and were\r\nallowed to make the well-known excuse of Talleyrand: ‘I have not had\r\nthe time to be short.’ When I had to condense the results of several\r\nmonths’ work--upon, let me say, the origins of law--into a penny\r\npamphlet, I had to give extra time in order to be short. But we wrote\r\nfor the workers, and twopence for a pamphlet is often too much for\r\nthem. The result was that our penny and halfpenny pamphlets sold by\r\nthe scores of thousands, and were reproduced in every other country in\r\ntranslations. My leaders from that period were edited later on, while\r\nI was in prison, by Elisée Reclus, under the title of ‘The Words of a\r\nRebel,’ ‘Paroles d’un Révolté.’\r\n\r\nFrance was always the chief object of our aims, but ‘Le Révolté’ was\r\nseverely prohibited in France, and the smugglers have so many good\r\nthings to import into France from Switzerland that they did not care to\r\nendanger their trade by meddling with papers. I went once with them,\r\ncrossing in their company the French frontier, and found that they were\r\nvery brave and reliable men, but I could not induce them to undertake\r\nthe smuggling in of our paper. All we could do was to send it in sealed\r\nenvelopes to about a hundred persons in France. We charged nothing for\r\npostage, leaving it to the voluntary contributions of our subscribers\r\nto cover our extra expenses--which they always did--but we often\r\nthought that the French police were missing a splendid opportunity for\r\nruining ‘Le Révolté,’ by subscribing to a hundred copies and sending no\r\nvoluntary contributions.\r\n\r\nFor the first year we had to rely entirely upon ourselves; but\r\ngradually Elisée Reclus took a greater interest in the work, and\r\nfinally joined us, giving after my arrest more life than ever to the\r\npaper. Reclus had invited me to aid him in the preparation of the\r\nvolume of his monumental geography, which dealt with the Russian\r\ndominions in Asia. He knew Russian himself, but he thought that, as I\r\nwas well acquainted with Siberia, I might aid him in a special way;\r\nand as the health of my wife was poor, and the doctor had ordered her\r\nto leave Geneva with its cold winds at once, we removed early in the\r\nspring of 1880 to Clarens, where Elisée Reclus lived at that time. We\r\nsettled above Clarens, in a small cottage overlooking the blue waters\r\nof the lake, with the pure snow of the Dent du Midi in the background.\r\nA streamlet that thundered like a mighty torrent after rains, carrying\r\naway immense rocks in its narrow bed, ran under our windows, and on\r\nthe slope of the hill opposite rose the old castle of Châtelard,\r\nof which the owners, up to the revolution of the _burla papei_ (the\r\nburners of the papers) in 1799, levied upon the neighbouring serfs\r\nfeudal taxes on the occasion of their births, marriages, and deaths.\r\nHere, aided by my wife, with whom I used to discuss every event and\r\nevery proposed paper, and who was a severe literary critic of my\r\nwritings, I produced the best things that I wrote for ‘Le Révolté,’\r\namong them the address ‘To the Young,’ which was spread in hundreds of\r\nthousands of copies in all languages. In fact, I worked out here the\r\nfoundation of nearly all that I have written later on. Contact with\r\neducated men of similar ways of thinking is what we anarchist writers,\r\nscattered by proscription all over the world, miss, perhaps, more than\r\nanything else. At Clarens I had that contact with Elisée Reclus and\r\nLefrançais, in addition to permanent contact with the workers, which I\r\ncontinued to maintain; and although I worked much for the geography, I\r\nwas able to produce even more than usually for the anarchist propaganda.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nIn Russia, the struggle for freedom was taking a more and more acute\r\ncharacter. Several political trials had been brought before high\r\ncourts--the trial of ‘the hundred and ninety-three,’ of ‘the fifty,’\r\nof ‘the Dolgúshin circle,’ and so on--and in all of them the same\r\nthing was apparent. The youth had gone to the peasants and the factory\r\nworkers, preaching socialism to them; socialist pamphlets, printed\r\nabroad, had been distributed; appeals had been made to revolt--in some\r\nvague, indeterminate way--against the oppressive economical conditions.\r\nIn short, nothing was done that is not done in the socialist agitation\r\nin every other country of the world. No traces of conspiracy against\r\nthe Tsar, nor even of preparations for revolutionary action, were\r\nfound; in fact, there were none. The great majority of our youth\r\nwere at that time hostile to such action. Nay, looking now over that\r\nmovement of the years 1870-78, I can confidently say that most of them\r\nwould have felt satisfied if they had been simply allowed to live by\r\nthe side of the peasants and the factory-workers, to teach them, to\r\ncollaborate with them, either individually or as members of the local\r\nself-government, in any of the thousand capacities in which an educated\r\nand earnest man or woman can be useful to the masses of the people. I\r\nknew the men and say so with full knowledge of them.\r\n\r\nYet the sentences were ferocious--stupidly ferocious, because the\r\nmovement, which had grown out of the previous state of Russia, was too\r\ndeeply rooted to be crushed down by mere brutality. Hard labour for\r\nsix, ten, twelve years in the mines, with subsequent exile to Siberia\r\nfor life, was a common sentence. There were such cases as that of a\r\ngirl who got nine years’ hard labour and life exile to Siberia, for\r\ngiving one socialist pamphlet to a worker: that was all her crime.\r\nAnother girl of fourteen, Miss Gukóvskaya, was transported for life to\r\na remote village of Siberia, for having tried, like Goethe’s Klärchen,\r\nto excite an indifferent crowd to deliver Koválsky and his friends when\r\nthey were going to be hanged--an act the more natural in Russia, even\r\nfrom the authorities’ standpoint, as there is no capital punishment\r\nin our country for common-law crimes, and the application of the\r\ndeath penalty to ‘politicals’ was then a novelty, a return to almost\r\nforgotten traditions. Thrown into the wilderness, this young girl soon\r\ndrowned herself in the Yeniséi. Even those who were acquitted by the\r\ncourts were banished by the gendarmes to little hamlets in Siberia and\r\nNorth-east Russia, where they had to starve on the government allowance\r\nof six shillings per month. There are no industries in such hamlets,\r\nand the exiles were strictly prohibited from teaching.\r\n\r\nAs if to exasperate the youth still more, their condemned friends were\r\nnot sent direct to Siberia. They were locked up first for a number of\r\nyears, in central prisons, which made them envy the convict’s life in\r\na Siberian mine. These prisons were awful indeed. In one of them--‘a\r\nden of typhoid fever,’ as the priest of that particular gaol said in\r\na sermon--the mortality reached twenty per cent. in twelve months.\r\nIn the central prisons, in the hard labour prisons of Siberia, in\r\nthe fortress, the prisoners had to resort to the strike of death,\r\nthe famine strike, to protect themselves from the brutality of the\r\nwarders, or to obtain conditions--some sort of work, or reading, in\r\ntheir cells--that would save them from being driven into insanity in\r\na few months. The horror of such strikes, during which men and women\r\nrefused to take any food for seven or eight days in succession, and\r\nthen lay motionless, their minds wandering, seemed not to appeal to\r\nthe gendarmes. At Khárkoff, the prostrated prisoners were tied up with\r\nropes and fed artificially, by force.\r\n\r\nInformation of these horrors leaked out from the prisons, crossed the\r\nboundless distances of Siberia, and spread far and wide among the\r\nyouth. There was a time when not a week passed without disclosing some\r\nnew infamy of that sort, or even worse.\r\n\r\nSheer exasperation took hold of our young people. ‘In other countries,’\r\nthey began to say, ‘men have the courage to resist. An Englishman, a\r\nFrenchman, would not tolerate such outrages. How can we tolerate them?\r\nLet us resist, arms in hand, the nocturnal raids of the gendarmes; let\r\nthem know, at least, that since arrest means a slow and infamous death\r\nat their hands, they will have to take us in a mortal struggle.’ At\r\nOdessa, Koválsky and his friends met with revolver shots the gendarmes\r\nwho came one night to arrest them.\r\n\r\nThe reply of Alexander II. to this new move was the proclamation of a\r\nstate of siege. Russia was divided into a number of districts, each of\r\nthem under a governor-general, who received the order to hang offenders\r\npitilessly. Koválsky and his friends--who, by the way, had killed no\r\none by their shots--were executed. Hanging became the order of the\r\nday. Twenty-three persons perished in two years, including a boy of\r\nnineteen, who was caught posting a revolutionary proclamation at a\r\nrailway station: this act was the only charge against him. He was a\r\nboy, but he died like a man.\r\n\r\nThen the watchword of the revolutionists became ‘self-defence:’\r\nself-defence against the spies who introduced themselves into the\r\ncircles under the mask of friendship, and denounced members right and\r\nleft, simply because they would not be paid if they did not denounce\r\nlarge numbers of persons; self-defence against those who ill-treated\r\nprisoners; self-defence against the omnipotent chiefs of the state\r\npolice.\r\n\r\nThree functionaries of mark and two or three small spies fell in\r\nthat new phase of the struggle. General Mézentsoff, who had induced\r\nthe Tsar to double the sentences after the trial of the hundred\r\nand ninety-three, was killed in broad daylight at St. Petersburg;\r\na gendarme colonel, guilty of something worse than that, had the\r\nsame fate at Kíeff; and the Governor-General of Khárkoff--my cousin,\r\nDmítri Kropótkin--was shot as he was returning home from a theatre.\r\nThe central prison, in which the first famine strike and artificial\r\nfeeding took place, was under his orders. In reality, he was not a\r\nbad man--I know that his personal feelings were somewhat favourable\r\nto the political prisoners; but he was a weak man and a courtier,\r\nand he hesitated to interfere. One word from him would have stopped\r\nthe ill-treatment of the prisoners. Alexander II. liked him so much,\r\nand his position at the court was so strong, that his interference\r\nvery probably would have been approved. ‘Thank you; you have acted\r\naccording to my own wishes,’ the Tsar said to him, a couple of years\r\nbefore that date, when he came to St. Petersburg to report that he\r\nhad taken a peaceful attitude in a riot of the poorer population of\r\nKhárkoff, and had treated the rioters very leniently. But this time he\r\ngave his approval to the gaolers, and the young men of Khárkoff were so\r\nexasperated at the treatment of their friends that one of them shot him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHowever, the personality of the Emperor was kept out of the struggle,\r\nand down to the year 1879 no attempt was made on his life. The person\r\nof the Liberator of the serfs was surrounded by an aureole which\r\nprotected him infinitely better than the swarms of police officials. If\r\nAlexander II. had shown at this juncture the least desire to improve\r\nthe state of affairs in Russia; if he had only called in one or two of\r\nthose men with whom he had collaborated during the reform period, and\r\nhad ordered them to make an inquiry into the conditions of the country,\r\nor merely of the peasantry; if he had shown any intention of limiting\r\nthe powers of the secret police, his steps would have been hailed with\r\nenthusiasm. A word would have made him ‘the Liberator’ again, and\r\nonce more the youth would have repeated Hérzen’s words: ‘Thou hast\r\nconquered, Galilean.’ But just as during the Polish insurrection the\r\ndespot awoke in him, and, inspired by Katkóff, he resorted to hanging,\r\nso now again, following the advice of the same evil genius, Katkóff,\r\nhe found nothing to do but to nominate special military governors--for\r\nhanging.\r\n\r\nThen, and then only, a handful of revolutionists--the Executive\r\nCommittee--supported, I must say, by the growing discontent in the\r\neducated classes, and even in the Tsar’s immediate surroundings,\r\ndeclared that war against absolutism which, after several attempts,\r\nended in 1881 in the death of Alexander II.\r\n\r\nTwo men, I have said already, lived in Alexander II., and now the\r\nconflict between the two, which had grown during all his life, assumed\r\na really tragic aspect. When he met Solovióff, who shot at him and\r\nmissed the first shot, he had the presence of mind to run to the\r\nnearest door, not in a straight line, but in zigzags, while Solovióff\r\ncontinued to fire; and he thus escaped with but a slight tearing of\r\nhis overcoat. On the day of his death, too, he gave a proof of his\r\nundoubted courage. In the face of real danger he was courageous; but\r\nhe continually trembled before the phantasms of his own imagination.\r\nOnce he shot at an aide-de-camp, when the latter had made an abrupt\r\nmovement, and Alexander thought he was going to attempt his life.\r\nMerely to save his life, he surrendered entirely all his imperial\r\npowers into the hands of those who cared nothing for him, but only for\r\ntheir lucrative positions.\r\n\r\nHe undoubtedly retained an attachment to the mother of his children,\r\neven though he was then with the Princess Dolgorúki, whom he married\r\nimmediately after the death of the Empress. ‘Don’t speak to me of the\r\nEmpress; it makes me suffer too much,’he more than once said to Lóris\r\nMélikoff. And yet he entirely abandoned the Empress Marie, who had\r\nstood faithfully by his side while he was the Liberator; he let her die\r\nin the palace in complete neglect, having by her side only two ladies\r\nentirely devoted to her, while he stayed himself in another palace, and\r\npaid her only short official visits. A well-known Russian doctor, now\r\ndead, told his friends that he, a stranger, felt shocked at the neglect\r\nwith which the Empress was treated during her last illness--deserted,\r\nof course, by the ladies of the court, who reserved their courtesies\r\nfor the Princess Dolgorúki.\r\n\r\nWhen the Executive Committee made the daring attempt to blow up the\r\nWinter Palace itself, Alexander II. took a step which had no precedent.\r\nHe created a sort of dictatorship, vesting unlimited powers in Lóris\r\nMélikoff. This General was an Armenian, to whom Alexander II. had\r\nonce before given similar dictatorial powers, when the bubonic plague\r\nbroke out on the Lower Vólga, and Germany threatened to mobilize her\r\ntroops and put Russia under quarantine if the plague were not stopped.\r\nNow, when he saw that he could not have confidence in the vigilance\r\neven of the Palace police, Alexander II. gave dictatorial powers to\r\nLóris Mélikoff, and as Mélikoff had the reputation of being a Liberal,\r\nthis new move was interpreted in the sense that the convocation of a\r\nNational Assembly would soon follow. However, no new attempts against\r\nhis life having been made immediately after that explosion, he regained\r\nconfidence, and a few months later, before Mélikoff had been allowed to\r\ndo anything, the dictator became simply a Minister of the Interior.\r\n\r\nThe sudden attacks of sadness of which I have already spoken, during\r\nwhich Alexander II. reproached himself with the reactionary character\r\nhis reign had assumed, now took the shape of violent paroxysms of\r\ntears. He would sit weeping by the hour, filling Mélikoff with despair.\r\nThen he would ask his minister, ‘When will your constitutional scheme\r\nbe ready?’ But if, two days later, Mélikoff said that it was ready, the\r\nEmperor seemed to have forgotten all about it. ‘Did I mention it?’ he\r\nwould ask. ‘What for? We had better leave it to my successor. That will\r\nbe his gift to Russia.’\r\n\r\nWhen rumours of a new plot reached him, he was ready to undertake\r\nsomething, in order to give satisfaction to the Executive Committee;\r\nbut when everything seemed to be quiet among the revolutionists, he\r\nturned his ear again to his reactionary advisers, and let things go. At\r\nany moment Mélikoff expected dismissal.\r\n\r\nIn February 1881 Mélikoff reported that a new plot had been laid by\r\nthe Executive Committee, but its plan could not be discovered by any\r\namount of searching. Thereupon Alexander II. decided that a sort of\r\nconsultative assembly of delegates from the provinces should be called.\r\nAlways under the idea that he would share the fate of Louis XVI., he\r\ndescribed this gathering as an _Assemblée des Notables_, like the\r\none convoked by Louis XVI. before the National Assembly in 1789. The\r\nscheme had to be laid before the council of state, but then again he\r\nhesitated. It was only on the morning of March 1 (13), 1881, after a\r\nnew warning by Lóris Mélikoff, that he ordered it to be brought before\r\nthe council on the following Thursday. This was on Sunday, and he was\r\nasked by Mélikoff not to go out to the parade that day, there being\r\nimmediate danger of an attempt on his life. Nevertheless, he went. He\r\nwanted to see the Grand Duchess Catherine (daughter of his aunt, Hélène\r\nPávlovna, who had been one of the leaders of the reform party in 1861),\r\nand to carry her the welcome news, perhaps as an expiatory offering to\r\nthe memory of the Empress Marie. He is said to have told her, ‘_Je me\r\nsuis décidé à convoquer une Assemblée des Notables_.’ However, this\r\nbelated and half-hearted concession had not been announced, and on his\r\nway back to the Winter Palace he was killed.\r\n\r\nIt is known how it happened. A bomb was thrown under his iron-clad\r\ncarriage, to stop it. Several Circassians of the escort were wounded.\r\nRysakóff, who flung the bomb, was arrested on the spot. Then, although\r\nthe coachman of the Tsar earnestly advised him not to get out, saying\r\nthat he could drive him still in the slightly damaged carriage, he\r\ninsisted upon alighting. He felt that his military dignity required him\r\nto see the wounded Circassians, to condole with them as he had done\r\nwith the wounded during the Turkish war, when a mad storming of Plevna,\r\ndoomed to end in a terrible disaster, was made on the day of his fête.\r\nHe approached Rysakóff and asked him something; and as he passed close\r\nby another young man, Grinevétsky, who stood there with a bomb,\r\nGrinevétsky threw the bomb between himself and the Tsar, so that both\r\nof them should be killed. Both were fearfully wounded, and lived but a\r\nfew hours.\r\n\r\nThere Alexander II. lay upon the snow, abandoned by every one of his\r\nfollowers! All had disappeared. It was some cadets, returning from the\r\nparade, who lifted the dying Tsar and put him in a sledge, covering his\r\nshivering body with a cadet mantle. And it was one of the terrorists,\r\nEmeliánoff, with a bomb wrapped in a paper under his arm, who, at the\r\nrisk of being arrested on the spot and hanged, rushed with the cadets\r\nto the help of the wounded man. Human nature is full of these contrasts.\r\n\r\nThus ended the tragedy of Alexander the Second’s life. People could\r\nnot understand how it was possible that a Tsar who had done so much\r\nfor Russia should have met his death at the hands of revolutionists.\r\nTo me, who had the chance of witnessing the first reactionary steps of\r\nAlexander II. and his gradual deterioration, who had caught a glimpse\r\nof his complex personality, and seen in him a born autocrat, whose\r\nviolence was but partially mitigated by education, a man possessed of\r\nmilitary gallantry, but devoid of the courage of the statesman, a man\r\nof strong passions and weak will--it seemed that the tragedy developed\r\nwith the unavoidable fatality of one of Shakespeare’s dramas. Its last\r\nact was already written for me on the day when I heard him address\r\nus, the promoted officers, on June 13, 1862, immediately after he had\r\nordered the first executions in Poland.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nA wild panic seized the court circles at St. Petersburg. Alexander\r\nIII., who, notwithstanding his colossal stature and force, was not\r\na very courageous man, refused to move to the Winter Palace, and\r\nretired to the palace of his grandfather, Paul I., at Gatchina. I\r\nknow that old building, planned as a Vauban fortress, surrounded by\r\nmoats and protected by watch towers, from the tops of which secret\r\nstaircases lead to the Emperor’s study. I have seen the trap-doors in\r\nthe study for suddenly throwing an enemy on the sharp rocks in the\r\nwater underneath, and the secret staircase leading to underground\r\nprisons and to an underground passage which opens on a lake. All the\r\npalaces of Paul I. had been built on a similar plan. In the meantime,\r\nan underground gallery, supplied with automatic electric appliances\r\nto protect it from being undermined by the revolutionists, was dug\r\nround the Aníchkoff palace in which Alexander III. resided when he was\r\nheir-apparent.\r\n\r\nA secret league for the protection of the Tsar was started. Officers of\r\nall grades were induced by triple salaries to join it, and to undertake\r\nvoluntary spying in all classes of society. Amusing scenes followed, of\r\ncourse. Two officers, without knowing that they both belonged to the\r\nleague, would entice each other into a disloyal conversation, during\r\na railway journey, and then proceed to arrest each other, only to\r\ndiscover at the last moment that their pains had been labour lost. This\r\nleague still exists in a more official shape, under the name of Okhrána\r\n(Protection), and from time to time frightens the present Tsar with all\r\nsorts of concocted dangers, in order to maintain its existence.\r\n\r\nA still more secret organization, the Holy League, was formed at the\r\nsame time, under the leadership of the brother of the Tsar, Vladímir,\r\nfor the purpose of opposing the revolutionists in different ways,\r\none of which was to kill those of the refugees who were supposed to\r\nhave been the leaders of the late conspiracies. I was of this number.\r\nThe grand duke violently reproached the officers of the league for\r\ntheir cowardice, regretting that there were none among them who would\r\nundertake to kill such refugees; and an officer, who had been a page\r\nde chambre at the time I was in the corps of pages, was appointed by\r\nthe league to carry out this particular work.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that the refugees abroad did not interfere with the work\r\nof the Executive Committee at St. Petersburg. To pretend to direct\r\nconspiracies from Switzerland, while those who were at St. Petersburg\r\nacted under a permanent menace of death, would have been sheer\r\nnonsense; and as Stepniák and I wrote several times, none of us would\r\nhave accepted the dubious task of forming plans of action without being\r\non the spot. But, of course, it suited the plans of the St. Petersburg\r\npolice to maintain that they were powerless to protect the Tsar because\r\nall plots were devised abroad, and their spies--I know it well--amply\r\nsupplied them with the desired reports.\r\n\r\nSkóbeleff, the hero of the Turkish war, was also asked to join this\r\nleague, but he blankly refused. It appears from Lóris Mélikoff’s\r\nposthumous papers, part of which were published by a friend of his at\r\nLondon, that when Alexander III. came to the throne, and hesitated to\r\nconvoke the Assembly of Notables, Skóbeleff even made an offer to Lóris\r\nMélikoff and Count Ignátieff (‘the lying Pasha,’ as the Constantinople\r\ndiplomatists used to nickname him) to arrest Alexander III., and compel\r\nhim to sign a constitutional manifesto; whereupon Ignátieff is said to\r\nhave denounced the scheme to the Tsar, and thus to have obtained his\r\nnomination as prime minister, in which capacity he resorted, with the\r\nadvice of M. Andrieux, the ex-prefect of police at Paris, to various\r\nstratagems in order to paralyze the revolutionists.\r\n\r\nIf the Russian Liberals had shown even moderate courage and some power\r\nof organized action at that time, a National Assembly would have\r\nbeen convoked. From the same posthumous papers of Lóris Mélikoff,\r\nit appears that Alexander III. was willing for a time to convoke a\r\nNational Assembly. He had made up his mind to do so, and had announced\r\nit to his brother. Old Wilhelm I. supported him in this intention. It\r\nwas only when he saw that the Liberals undertook nothing, while the\r\nKatkóff party was busy at work in the opposite direction--M. Andrieux\r\nadvising him to crush the nihilists and indicating how it ought to be\r\ndone (the ex-prefect’s letter to this effect was published in the said\r\npapers)--that Alexander III. finally resolved on declaring that he\r\nwould continue to be an absolute ruler of the Empire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA few months after the death of Alexander II. I was expelled from\r\nSwitzerland by order of the federal council. I did not take umbrage\r\nat this. Assailed by the monarchical powers on account of the asylum\r\nwhich Switzerland offered to refugees, and menaced by the Russian\r\nofficial press with a wholesale expulsion of all Swiss governesses and\r\nladies’ maids, who are numerous in Russia, the rulers of Switzerland,\r\nby banishing me, gave some sort of satisfaction to the Russian police.\r\nBut I very much regret, for the sake of Switzerland itself, that that\r\nstep was taken. It was a sanction given to the theory of ‘conspiracies\r\nconcocted in Switzerland,’ and it was an acknowledgment of weakness, of\r\nwhich other powers took advantage at once. Two years later, when Jules\r\nFerry proposed to Italy and Germany the partition of Switzerland, his\r\nargument must have been that the Swiss Government itself had admitted\r\nthat Switzerland was ‘a hotbed of international conspiracies.’ This\r\nfirst concession led to more arrogant demands, and has certainly placed\r\nSwitzerland in a far less independent position than it might otherwise\r\nhave occupied.\r\n\r\nThe decree of expulsion was delivered to me immediately after I had\r\nreturned from London, where I was present at an anarchist congress in\r\nJuly 1881. After that congress I had stayed for a few weeks in England,\r\nwriting the first articles on Russian affairs from our standpoint, for\r\nthe ‘Newcastle Chronicle.’ The English press, at that time, was an\r\necho of the opinions of Madame Novikóff--that is, of Katkóff and the\r\nRussian state police--and I was most happy when Mr. Joseph Cowen agreed\r\nto give me the hospitality of his paper in order to state our point of\r\nview.\r\n\r\nI had just joined my wife in the high mountains where she was staying,\r\nnear the abode of Elisée Reclus, when I was asked to leave Switzerland.\r\nWe sent the little luggage we had to the next railway station and went\r\non foot to Aigle, enjoying for the last time the sight of the mountains\r\nthat we loved so much. We crossed the hills by taking short cuts over\r\nthem, and laughed when we discovered that the short cuts led to long\r\nwindings; and when we reached the bottom of the valley, we tramped\r\nalong the dusty road. The comical incident which always comes in such\r\ncases was supplied by an English lady. A richly dressed dame, reclining\r\nby the side of a gentleman in a hired carriage, threw several tracts\r\nto the two poorly dressed tramps, as she passed them. I lifted the\r\ntracts from the dust. She was evidently one of those ladies who believe\r\nthemselves to be Christians, and consider it their duty to distribute\r\nreligious tracts among ‘dissolute foreigners.’ Thinking we were sure\r\nto overtake the lady at the railway station, I wrote on one of the\r\npamphlets the well-known verse relative to the rich and the Kingdom of\r\nGod, and similarly appropriate quotations about the Pharisees being\r\nthe worst enemies of Christianity. When we came to Aigle, the lady\r\nwas taking refreshments in her carriage. She evidently preferred to\r\ncontinue the journey in this vehicle along the lovely valley, rather\r\nthan to be shut up in a stuffy railway train. I returned her the\r\npamphlets with politeness, saying that I had added to them something\r\nthat she might find useful for her own instruction. The lady did not\r\nknow whether to fly at me or to accept the lesson with Christian\r\npatience. Her eyes expressed both impulses in rapid succession.\r\n\r\nMy wife was about to pass her examination for the degree of Bachelor\r\nof Science at the Geneva University, and we settled, therefore, in a\r\ntiny town of France, Thonon, situated on the Savoy coast of the Lake of\r\nGeneva, and stayed there a couple of months.\r\n\r\nAs to the death sentence of the Holy League, a warning reached me\r\nfrom one of the highest quarters of Russia. Even the name of the lady\r\nwho was sent from St. Petersburg to Geneva to be the head centre of\r\nthe conspiracy became known to me. So I simply communicated the fact\r\nto the Geneva correspondent of the ‘Times,’ asking him to publish\r\nthe information if anything should happen, and I put a note to that\r\neffect in ‘Le Révolté.’ After that I did not trouble myself more about\r\nit. My wife did not take it so lightly, and the good peasant woman,\r\nMadame Sansaux, who gave us board and lodgings at Thonon, and who had\r\nlearned of the plot in a different way (through her sister, who was a\r\nnurse in the family of a Russian agent), bestowed the most touching\r\ncare upon me. Her cottage was out of town, and whenever I went to\r\ntown at night--sometimes to meet my wife at the railway station--she\r\nalways found a pretext to have me accompanied by her husband with a\r\nlantern. ‘Wait only a moment, Monsieur Kropótkin,’ she would say;\r\n‘my husband is going that way for purchases, and you know he always\r\ncarries a lantern!’ Or else she would send her brother to follow me at\r\na distance, without my noticing it.\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nIn October or November 1881, as soon as my wife had passed her\r\nexamination, we removed from Thonon to London, where we stayed nearly\r\ntwelve months. Few years separate us from that time, and yet I can say\r\nthat the intellectual life of London and of all England was quite\r\ndifferent then from what it became a little later. Everyone knows\r\nthat in the forties England stood almost at the head of the socialist\r\nmovement in Europe; but during the years of reaction that followed,\r\nthis great movement, which had deeply affected the working classes,\r\nand in which all that is now put forward as scientific or anarchist\r\nsocialism had already been said, came to a standstill. It was forgotten\r\nin England as well as on the Continent, and what the French writers\r\ndescribe as ‘the third awakening of the proletarians’ had not yet begun\r\nin Britain. The labours of the agricultural commission of 1871, the\r\npropaganda amongst the agricultural labourers, and the previous efforts\r\nof the Christian socialists had certainly done something to prepare the\r\nway; but the outburst of socialist feeling in England which followed\r\nthe publication of Henry George’s ‘Progress and Poverty’ had not yet\r\ntaken place.\r\n\r\nThe year that I then passed in London was a year of real exile. For\r\none who held advanced socialist opinions, there was no atmosphere to\r\nbreathe in. There was no sign of that animated socialist movement which\r\nI found so largely developed on my return in 1886. Burns, Champion,\r\nHardie, and the other labour leaders were not yet heard of; the Fabians\r\ndid not exist; Morris had not declared himself a socialist; and the\r\ntrade unions, limited in London to a few privileged trades only, were\r\nhostile to socialism. The only active and outspoken representatives\r\nof the socialist movement were Mr. and Mrs. Hyndman, with a very few\r\nworkers grouped round them. They had held in the autumn of 1881 a\r\nsmall congress, and we used to say jokingly--but it was very nearly\r\ntrue--that Mrs. Hyndman had received all the congress in her house.\r\nMoreover, the more or less socialist radical movement which was\r\ncertainly going on in the minds of men did not assert itself frankly\r\nand openly. That considerable number of educated men and women who\r\nappeared in public life four years later, and, without committing\r\nthemselves to socialism, took part in various movements connected with\r\nthe well-being or the education of the masses, and who have now created\r\nin almost every city of England and Scotland a quite new atmosphere of\r\nreform and a new society of reformers, had not then made themselves\r\nfelt. They were there, of course; they thought and spoke; all the\r\nelements for a widespread movement were in existence; but, finding none\r\nof those centres of attraction which the socialist groups subsequently\r\nbecame, they were lost in the crowd; they did not know one another, or\r\nremained unconscious of their own selves.\r\n\r\nTchaykóvsky was then in London, and, as in years past, we began a\r\nsocialist propaganda amongst the workers. Aided by a few English\r\nworkers whose acquaintance we had made at the congress of 1881, or whom\r\nthe prosecutions against John Most had attracted to the socialists,\r\nwe went to the Radical clubs, speaking about Russian affairs, the\r\nmovement of our youth toward the people, and socialism in general. We\r\nhad ridiculously small audiences, seldom consisting of more than a\r\ndozen men. Occasionally some grey-bearded Chartist would rise from the\r\naudience and tell us that all we were saying had been said forty years\r\nbefore, and was greeted then with enthusiasm by crowds of workers, but\r\nthat now all was dead, and there was no hope of reviving it.\r\n\r\nMr. Hyndman had just published his excellent exposition of Marxist\r\nsocialism under the title of ‘England for All’; and I remember, one\r\nday in the summer of 1882, earnestly advising him to start a socialist\r\npaper. I told him with what small means we began editing ‘Le Révolté,’\r\nand predicted a certain success if he would make the attempt. But\r\nso unpromising was the general outlook, that even he thought the\r\nundertaking would be a certain failure, unless he had the means to\r\ndefray all its expenses. Perhaps he was right; but when, less than\r\nthree years later, he started ‘Justice,’ it found a hearty support\r\namong the workers, and early in 1886 there were three socialist papers,\r\nand the Social Democratic Federation was an influential body.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1882 I spoke, in broken English, before the Durham\r\nminers at their annual gathering; I delivered lectures at Newcastle,\r\nGlasgow, and Edinburgh about the Russian movement, and was received\r\nwith enthusiasm, a crowd of workers giving hearty cheers for the\r\nNihilists, after the meeting, in the street. But my wife and I felt so\r\nlonely at London, and our efforts to awaken a socialist movement in\r\nEngland seemed so hopeless, that in the autumn of 1882 we decided to\r\nremove again to France. We were sure that in France I should soon be\r\narrested; but we often said to each other, ‘Better a French prison than\r\nthis grave.’\r\n\r\nThose who are prone to speak of the slowness of evolution ought to\r\nstudy the development of socialism in England. Evolution _is_ slow; but\r\nits rate is not uniform. It has its periods of slumber and its periods\r\nof sudden progress.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nWe settled once more in Thonon, taking lodgings with our former\r\nhostess, Madame Sansaux. A brother of my wife, who was dying of\r\nconsumption, and had come to Switzerland, joined us.\r\n\r\nI never saw such numbers of Russian spies as during the two months\r\nthat I remained at Thonon. To begin with, as soon as we had engaged\r\nlodgings, a suspicious character, who gave himself out for an\r\nEnglishman, took the other part of the house. Flocks, literally flocks\r\nof Russian spies besieged the house, seeking admission under all\r\npossible pretexts, or simply tramping in pairs, trios, and quartettes\r\nin front of the house. I can imagine what wonderful reports they wrote.\r\nA spy must report. If he should merely say that he has stood for a week\r\nin the street without noticing anything mysterious, he would soon be\r\nput on the half-pay list or dismissed.\r\n\r\nIt was then the golden age of the Russian secret police. Ignátieff’s\r\npolicy had borne fruit. There were two or three bodies of police\r\ncompeting with one another, each having any amount of money at their\r\ndisposal, and carrying on the boldest intrigues. Colonel Sudéikin,\r\nfor instance, chief of one of the branches--plotting with a certain\r\nDegáeff, who after all killed him--denounced Ignátieff’s agents to\r\nthe revolutionists, and offered to the terrorists all facilities for\r\nkilling the minister of the interior, Count Tolstóy, and the Grand Duke\r\nVladímir; adding that he himself would then be nominated minister of\r\nthe interior, with dictatorial powers, and the Tsar would be entirely\r\nin his hands. This activity of the Russian police culminated, later on,\r\nin the kidnapping of the Prince of Battenberg from Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nThe French police, also, were on the alert. The question, ‘What is he\r\ndoing at Thonon?’ worried them. I continued to edit ‘Le Révolté,’ and\r\nwrote articles for the ‘Encyclopædia Britannica’ and the ‘Newcastle\r\nChronicle.’ But what reports could be made out of that? One day the\r\nlocal gendarme paid a visit to my landlady. He had heard from the\r\nstreet the rattling of some machine, and wished to report that I had\r\nin the house a secret printing press. So he came in my absence and\r\nasked the landlady to show him the press. She replied that there was\r\nnone, and suggested that perhaps the gendarme had overheard the noise\r\nof her sewing-machine. But he would not be convinced by so prosaic an\r\nexplanation, and actually compelled the landlady to use the machine,\r\nwhile he listened inside the house and outside, to make sure that the\r\nrattling he had heard was the same.\r\n\r\n‘What is he doing all day?’ he asked the landlady.\r\n\r\n‘He writes.’\r\n\r\n‘He cannot write all day long.’\r\n\r\n‘He saws wood in the garden at midday, and he takes walks every\r\nafternoon between four and five.’ It was in November.\r\n\r\n‘Ah, that’s it! When the dusk is coming on?’ (_A la tombée de la\r\nnuit?_) And he wrote in his note-book, ‘Never goes out except at dusk.’\r\n\r\nI could not well explain at that time this special attention of the\r\nRussian spies; but it must have had some connection with the following.\r\nWhen Ignátieff was nominated prime minister, advised by the ex-prefect\r\nof Paris, Andrieux, he hit on a new plan. He sent a swarm of his agents\r\ninto Switzerland, and one of them undertook the publication of a paper\r\nwhich slightly advocated the extension of provincial self-government in\r\nRussia, but whose chief purpose was to combat the revolutionists, and\r\nto rally to its standard those of the refugees who did not sympathize\r\nwith terrorism. This was certainly a means of sowing division. Then,\r\nwhen nearly all the members of the Executive Committee had been\r\narrested in Russia, and a couple of them had taken refuge at Paris,\r\nIgnátieff sent an agent to Paris to offer an armistice. He promised\r\nthat there should be no further executions on account of the plots\r\nduring the reign of Alexander II., even if those who had escaped arrest\r\nfell into the hands of the government; that Chernyshévsky should be\r\nreleased from Siberia; and that a commission should be nominated to\r\nrevise the cases of all those who had been exiled to Siberia without\r\ntrial. On the other side, he asked the Executive Committee to promise\r\nto make no attempts against the Tsar’s life until his coronation was\r\nover. Perhaps the reforms in favour of the peasants, which Alexander\r\nIII. intended to make, were also mentioned. The agreement was made\r\nat Paris, and was kept on both sides. The terrorists suspended\r\nhostilities. Nobody was executed for complicity in the former\r\nconspiracies; those who were arrested later on under this indictment\r\nwere immured in the Russian Bastille at Schlüsselburg, where nothing\r\nwas heard of them for fifteen years, and where most of them still\r\nare. Chernyshévsky was brought back from Siberia, and ordered to\r\nstay at Astrakhan, where he was severed from all connection with the\r\nintellectual world of Russia, and soon died. A commission went through\r\nSiberia, releasing some of the exiles, and specifying terms of exile\r\nfor the remainder. My brother Alexander received from it an additional\r\nfive years.\r\n\r\nWhile I was at London, in 1882, I was also told one day that a man who\r\npretended to be a _bonâ fide_ agent of the Russian government, and\r\ncould prove it, wanted to enter into negotiations with me. ‘Tell him\r\nthat if he comes to my house I will throw him down the staircase,’ was\r\nmy reply. The consequence of it was, I suppose, that while Ignátieff\r\nconsidered the Tsar guaranteed from the attacks of the Executive\r\nCommittee, he thought that the anarchists might make some attempt and\r\nwanted therefore to have me out of the way.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nThe anarchist movement had taken a considerable development in France\r\nduring the years 1881 and 1882. It was generally believed that the\r\nFrench mind was hostile to communism, and within the International\r\nWorkingmen’s Association ‘collectivism’ was preached instead.\r\nCollectivism meant then the possession of the instruments of production\r\nin common, each separate group having, however, to settle for itself\r\nwhether the consumption of produce should be on individualistic or\r\ncommunistic lines. In reality, the French mind was hostile only to\r\nthe monastic communism, to the _phalanstère_ of the old schools. When\r\nthe Jura Federation, at its congress of 1880, boldly declared itself\r\nanarchist-communist--that is, in favour of free communism--anarchism\r\nwon wide sympathy in France. Our paper began to spread in that country,\r\nletters were exchanged in great numbers with French workers, and an\r\nanarchist movement of importance rapidly developed at Paris and in some\r\nof the provinces, especially in the Lyons region. When I crossed France\r\nin 1881, on my way from Thonon to London, I visited Lyons, St. Etienne,\r\nand Vienne, lecturing there, and I found in these cities a considerable\r\nnumber of workers ready to accept our ideas.\r\n\r\nBy the end of 1882 a terrible crisis prevailed in the Lyons region. The\r\nsilk industry was paralysed, and the misery among the weavers was so\r\ngreat that crowds of children stood every morning at the gates of the\r\nbarracks, where the soldiers gave away what they could spare of their\r\nbread and soup. This was the beginning of the popularity of General\r\nBoulanger, who had permitted this distribution of food. The miners of\r\nthe region were also in a very precarious state.\r\n\r\nI knew that there was a great deal of fermentation, but during the\r\neleven months I had stayed at London I had lost close contact with\r\nthe French movement. A few weeks after I returned to Thonon I learned\r\nfrom the papers that the miners of Monceau-les-Mines, incensed at the\r\nvexations of the ultra-Catholic owners of the mines, had begun a sort\r\nof movement; they were holding secret meetings, talking of a general\r\nstrike; the stone crosses erected on all the roads round the mines\r\nwere thrown down or blown up by dynamite cartridges, which are largely\r\nused by the miners in underground work, and often remain in their\r\npossession. The agitation at Lyons also took a more violent character.\r\nThe anarchists, who were rather numerous in the city, allowed no\r\nmeeting of the opportunist politicians to be held without obtaining\r\na hearing for themselves--storming the platform, as a last resource.\r\nThey brought forward resolutions to the effect that the mines and all\r\nnecessaries for production, as well as the dwelling-houses, ought\r\nto be owned by the nation; and these resolutions were carried with\r\nenthusiasm, to the horror of the middle classes.\r\n\r\nThe feeling among the workers was growing every day against the\r\nopportunist town councillors and political leaders as also against\r\nthe Press, who made light of a very acute crisis, and undertook\r\nnothing to relieve the widespread misery. As is usual at such times,\r\nthe fury of the poorer people turned especially against the places\r\nof amusement and debauch, which become only the more conspicuous in\r\ntimes of desolation and misery, as they impersonate for the worker\r\nthe egotism and dissoluteness of the wealthier classes. A place\r\nparticularly hated by the workers was the underground café at the\r\nThéatre Bellecour, which remained open all night, and where, in the\r\nsmall hours of the morning, one could see newspaper men and politicians\r\nfeasting and drinking in company with gay women. Not a meeting was\r\nheld but some menacing allusion was made to that café, and one night a\r\ndynamite cartridge was exploded in it by an unknown hand. A socialist\r\nworking-man, who was occasionally there, jumped to blow out the lighted\r\nfuse of the cartridge, and was killed, while a few of the feasting\r\npoliticians were slightly wounded. Next day a dynamite cartridge was\r\nexploded at the doors of a recruiting bureau, and it was said that the\r\nanarchists intended to blow up the huge statue of the Virgin which\r\nstands on one of the hills of Lyons. One must have lived at Lyons or\r\nin its neighbourhood to realize the extent to which the population\r\nand the schools are still in the hands of the Catholic clergy, and to\r\nunderstand the hatred that the male portion of the population feel\r\ntoward the clergy.\r\n\r\nA panic now seized the wealthier classes of Lyons. Some sixty\r\nanarchists--all workers, and only one middle-class man, Emile Gautier,\r\nwho was on a lecturing tour in the region--were arrested. The Lyons\r\npapers undertook at the same time to incite the government to arrest\r\nme, representing me as the leader of the agitation, who had come from\r\nEngland in order to direct the movement. Russian spies began to parade\r\nagain in conspicuous numbers in our small town. Almost every day I\r\nreceived letters, evidently written by spies of the international\r\npolice, mentioning some dynamite plot, or mysteriously announcing\r\nthat consignments of dynamite had been shipped to me. I made quite\r\na collection of these letters, writing on each of them ‘Police\r\nInternationale,’ and they were taken away by the police when they made\r\na search in my house. But they did not dare to produce these letters\r\nin court, nor did they ever restore them to me. In December, the house\r\nwhere I stayed was searched in Russian fashion, and my wife, who was\r\ngoing to Geneva, was arrested at the station in Thonon, and also\r\nsearched. But of course nothing was found to compromise me or anyone\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nTen days passed, during which I was quite free to go away, if I\r\nhad wished to do so. I received several letters advising me to\r\ndisappear--one of them from an unknown Russian friend, perhaps a\r\nmember of the diplomatic staff, who seemed to have known me, and who\r\nwrote that I must leave at once, because otherwise I should be the\r\nfirst victim of an extradition treaty which was about to be concluded\r\nbetween France and Russia. I remained where I was; and when the ‘Times’\r\ninserted a telegram saying that I had disappeared from Thonon, I wrote\r\na letter to the paper giving my address, and declaring that since so\r\nmany of my friends were arrested I had no intention of leaving.\r\n\r\nIn the night of December 21, my brother-in-law died in my arms. We knew\r\nthat his illness was incurable, but to see a young life extinguished\r\nin your presence, after a brave struggle against death, is terrible.\r\nWe both were quite broken down. Three or four hours later, as the dull\r\nwinter morning was dawning, gendarmes came to the house to arrest me.\r\nSeeing in what a state my wife was, I asked to remain with her till the\r\nburial was over, promising upon my word of honour to be at the prison\r\ndoor at a given hour; but this was refused, and the same night I was\r\ntaken to Lyons. Elisée Reclus, notified by telegraph, came at once,\r\nbestowing on my wife all the gentleness of his great heart; friends\r\ncame from Geneva; and although the funeral was an absolutely civil one,\r\nwhich was a novelty in that little town, half of the population was at\r\nthe burial, to show my wife that the hearts of the poorer classes and\r\nthe simple Savoy peasants were with us, and not with their rulers. When\r\nmy trial was going on, the peasants followed it with sympathy, and used\r\nto come every day from the mountain villages to town to get the papers.\r\n\r\nAnother incident which profoundly touched me was the arrival at Lyons\r\nof an English friend. He came on behalf of a gentleman well known and\r\nesteemed in the English political world, in whose family I had spent\r\nmany happy hours at London in 1882. He was the bearer of a considerable\r\nsum of money for the purpose of obtaining my release on bail, and he\r\ntransmitted me at the same time the message of my London friend that\r\nI need not care in the least about the bail, but must leave France\r\nimmediately. In some mysterious way he managed to see me freely--not in\r\nthe double-grated iron cage in which I was allowed interviews with my\r\nwife--and he was as much affected by my refusal to accept the offer he\r\ncame to make as I was by this touching token of friendship on the part\r\nof one who, with his wonderfully excellent wife, I had already learnt\r\nto esteem so highly.\r\n\r\nThe French government wanted to have one of those great trials which\r\nproduce an impression upon the population, but there was no possibility\r\nof prosecuting the arrested anarchists for the explosions. It would\r\nhave required bringing us before a jury, which in all probability\r\nwould have acquitted us. Consequently, the government adopted the\r\nMachiavellian course of prosecuting us for having belonged to the\r\nInternational Workingmen’s Association. There is in France a law,\r\npassed immediately after the fall of the Commune, under which men can\r\nbe brought before a simple police court for having belonged to that\r\nassociation. The maximum penalty is five years’ imprisonment; and a\r\npolice court is always sure to pronounce the sentences which are wanted\r\nby the government.\r\n\r\nThe trial began at Lyons in the first days of January 1883, and lasted\r\nabout a fortnight. The accusation was ridiculous, as everyone knew that\r\nnone of the Lyons workers had ever joined the International, and it\r\nentirely fell through, as may be seen from the following episode. The\r\nonly witness for the prosecution was the chief of the secret police at\r\nLyons, an elderly man, who was treated at the court with the utmost\r\nrespect. His report, I must say, was quite correct as concerns the\r\nfacts. The anarchists, he said, had taken hold of the population, they\r\nhad rendered opportunist meetings impossible because they spoke at each\r\nsuch meeting, preaching communism and anarchism, and carrying with them\r\nthe audiences. Seeing that so far he had been fair in his testimony,\r\nI ventured to ask him a question: ‘Did you ever hear the name of the\r\nInternational Workingmen’s Association spoken of at Lyons?’\r\n\r\n‘Never,’ he replied sulkily.\r\n\r\n‘When I returned from the London congress of 1881, and did all I could\r\nto have the International reconstituted in France, did I succeed?’\r\n\r\n‘No. They did not find it revolutionary enough.’\r\n\r\n‘Thank you,’ I said, and turning toward the procureur I added, ‘There\r\nyou have all your case overthrown by your own witness!’\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we were all condemned for having belonged to the\r\nInternational. Four of us got the maximum sentence, five years’\r\nimprisonment and a hundred pounds’ fine; the remainder got from four\r\nyears to one year. In fact, our accusers never tried to prove anything\r\nconcerning the International. It was quite forgotten. We were simply\r\nasked to speak about anarchism, and so we did. Not a word was said\r\nabout the explosions; and when one or two of the Lyons comrades\r\nwanted to have this point cleared up, they were bluntly told that\r\nthey were not prosecuted for that, but for having belonged to the\r\nInternational--to which I alone belonged.\r\n\r\nThere is always some comical incident in such trials, and this time\r\nit was supplied by a letter of mine. There was nothing upon which\r\nto base the whole accusation. Scores of searches had been made at\r\nthe French anarchists’, but only two letters of mine had been found.\r\nThe prosecution tried to make the best of them. One was written to a\r\nFrench worker, who felt despondent and disheartened. I spoke to him in\r\nmy letter about the great times we were living in, the great changes\r\ncoming, the birth and spreading of new ideas, and so on. The letter\r\nwas not long, and little capital was made out of it by the procureur.\r\nAs to the other letter, it was twelve pages long. I had written it\r\nto another French friend, a young shoemaker. He earned his living by\r\nmaking shoes in his own room for a shop. On his left side he used to\r\nhave a small iron stove, upon which he himself cooked his daily meal,\r\nand upon his right a small stool upon which he wrote long letters to\r\nthe comrades, without leaving his shoemaker’s low bench. After he had\r\nmade just as many pairs of shoes as were required for covering the\r\nexpenses of his extremely modest living, and for sending a few francs\r\nto his old mother in the country, he would spend long hours in writing\r\nletters in which he developed the theoretical principles of anarchism\r\nwith admirable good sense and intelligence. He is now a writer, well\r\nknown in France and generally respected for the integrity of his\r\ncharacter. Unfortunately, at that time he would cover eight or twelve\r\npages of notepaper without having put one single full-stop, or even a\r\ncomma. I once sat down and wrote a long letter in which I explained to\r\nhim how our thoughts subdivide into groups of sentences, which must be\r\nmarked by full-stops; into separate sentences which must be separated\r\nby stops, and finally into secondary ones which deserve the charity of\r\nbeing marked at least with commas. I told him how much it would improve\r\nhis writings if he took this simple precaution.\r\n\r\nThis letter was read by the prosecutor before the court, and elicited\r\nfrom him most pathetic comments: ‘You have heard, gentlemen, this\r\nletter’--he went on, addressing the court. ‘You have listened to it.\r\nThere is nothing particular in it at first sight. He gives a lesson\r\nof grammar to a worker.... But’--and here his voice vibrated with\r\naccents of deep emotion--‘it was not in order to help a poor worker in\r\ninstruction which he, owing probably to his laziness, failed to get\r\nat school. It was not to help him in earning an honest living.... No,\r\ngentlemen--it was written in order to inspire him with hatred for our\r\ngrand and beautiful institutions, in order only the better to infuse\r\nhim with the venom of anarchism, in order to make of him only a more\r\nterrible enemy of society.... Cursed be the day that Kropótkin put his\r\nfoot on the soil of France!’ he exclaimed with a wonderful pathos.\r\n\r\nWe could not help laughing like boys all the time he delivered that\r\nspeech; the judges stared at him as if to tell him that he was\r\noverdoing his rôle, but he seemed not to notice anything, and, carried\r\non by his eloquence, he went on speaking with more and more theatrical\r\ngestures and intonations. He really did his best to obtain his reward\r\nfrom the Russian government.\r\n\r\nVery soon after the condemnation the presiding magistrate was promoted\r\nto the magistracy of an assize court. As to the procureur and another\r\nmagistrate--one would hardly believe it--the Russian government offered\r\nthem the Russian cross of Sainte-Anne, and they were allowed by the\r\nrepublic to accept it! The famous Russian alliance had thus its origin\r\nin the Lyons trial.\r\n\r\nThis trial, which lasted a fortnight, during which most brilliant\r\nanarchist speeches, reported by all the papers, were made by such\r\nfirst-rate speakers as the worker Bernard and Emile Gautier, and during\r\nwhich all the accused took a very firm attitude, preaching all the time\r\nour doctrines, had a powerful influence in spreading anarchist ideas\r\nin France, and assuredly contributed to some extent to the revival of\r\nsocialism in other countries. As to the condemnation, it was so little\r\njustified by the proceedings that the French Press--with the exception\r\nof the papers devoted to the government--openly blamed the magistrates.\r\nEven the moderate ‘Journal des Economistes’ blamed the condemnation,\r\nwhich ‘nothing in the proceedings of the court could have made one\r\nforesee.’ The contest between the accusers and ourselves was won by us,\r\nin the public opinion. Immediately a proposition of amnesty was brought\r\nbefore the Chamber, and received about a hundred votes in support of\r\nit. It came up regularly every year, each time securing more and more\r\nvotes, until we were released.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nThe trial was over, but I remained for another couple of months at\r\nthe Lyons prison. Most of my comrades had lodged an appeal against\r\nthe decision of the police court and we had to wait for its results.\r\nWith four more comrades I refused to take any part in that appeal to a\r\nhigher court, and continued to work in my _pistole_. A great friend\r\nof mine, Martin--a clothier from Vienne--took another _pistole_ by the\r\nside of the one which I occupied, and as we were already condemned, we\r\nwere allowed to take our walks together; and when we had something to\r\nsay to each other between the walks, we used to correspond by means of\r\ntaps on the wall, just as in Russia.\r\n\r\nAlready during my sojourn at Lyons I began to realize the awfully\r\ndemoralising influence of the prisons upon the prisoners, which brought\r\nme later to condemn unconditionally the whole institution.\r\n\r\nThe Lyons prison is a ‘modern’ prison, built in the shape of a star,\r\non the cellular system. The spaces between the rays of the star-like\r\nbuilding are occupied by small asphalte-paved yards, and, weather\r\npermitting, the inmates are taken to these yards to work outdoors.\r\nThey mostly beat out the unwound silk cocoons to obtain floss silk.\r\nFlocks of children are also taken at certain hours to these yards.\r\nThin, emasculated, underfed--the shadows of children--I often watched\r\nthem from my window. Anæmia was plainly written on all the little faces\r\nand manifest in their thin, shivering bodies; and not only in the\r\ndormitories but also in the yards, in the full light of the sun, they\r\nthemselves increased their anæmia. What will become of these children\r\nafter they have passed through that schooling and come out with their\r\nhealth ruined, their will annihilated, their energy weakened? Anæmia,\r\nwith its weakened energy and unwillingness to work, its enfeebled\r\nwill, weakened intellect, and perverted imagination, is responsible\r\nfor crime to an infinitely greater extent than plethora, and it is\r\nprecisely this enemy of the human race which is bred in prison. And\r\nthen, the teachings which the children receive in these surroundings!\r\nMere isolation, even if it were rigorously carried out--and it cannot\r\nbe--would be of little avail; the whole atmosphere of every prison is\r\nan atmosphere of glorification of that sort of gambling in ‘clever\r\nstrokes’ which constitutes the very essence of theft, swindling,\r\nand all sorts of similar anti-social deeds. Whole generations of\r\nfuture prisoners are bred in these nurseries which the state supports\r\nand society tolerates, simply because it does not want to hear its\r\nown diseases spoken of and dissected. ‘Imprisoned in childhood:\r\nprison-bird for life,’ was what I heard afterwards from all those who\r\nwere interested in criminal matters. And when I saw these children\r\nand realized what they had to expect in the future, I could not but\r\ncontinually ask myself: ‘Which of them is the worst criminal--this\r\nchild or the judge who condemns every year hundreds of children to this\r\nfate?’ I gladly admit that the crime of these judges is unconscious.\r\nBut are, then, all the ‘crimes’ for which people are sent to prison as\r\nconscious as they are supposed to be?\r\n\r\nThere was another point which I vividly realized since the very first\r\nweeks of my imprisonment, but which, in some inconceivable way,\r\nescapes the attention of both the judges and the writers on criminal\r\nlaw--namely, that imprisonment in an immense number of cases is a\r\npunishment which strikes quite innocent people far more severely than\r\nthe condemned prisoners themselves.\r\n\r\nNearly every one of my comrades, who represented a fair average of the\r\nworking-men population, had either their wife and children to support,\r\nor a sister or an old mother who depended for their living upon his\r\nearnings. Now, being left without support, these women did their best\r\nto get work, and some of them got it, but none of them succeeded in\r\nearning regularly even as much as fifteen pence a day. Nine francs\r\n(less than eight shillings), and often six shillings a week, to support\r\nthemselves and their children was all they could earn. And that meant\r\nevidently underfeeding, privations of all sorts, and the deterioration\r\nof the health of the wife and the children: weakened intellect,\r\nweakened energy and will. I thus realized that what was going on in\r\nour law courts was in reality a condemnation of quite innocent people\r\nto all sorts of hardships, in most cases even worse than those to\r\nwhich the condemned man himself is submitted. The fiction is that the\r\nlaw punishes the man by inflicting upon him a variety of physical and\r\ndegrading hardships. But man is such a creature that whatever hardships\r\nbe imposed upon him, he gradually grows accustomed to them. As he\r\ncannot modify them he accepts them, and after a certain time he puts\r\nup with them, just as he puts up with a chronic disease, and grows\r\ninsensible to it. But what, during his imprisonment, becomes of his\r\nwife and children, that is, of the innocent people who depend upon him\r\nfor support? They are punished even more cruelly than he himself is.\r\nAnd in our routine habits of thought no one ever thinks of the immense\r\ninjustice which is thus committed. I realized it only from actual\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the middle of March 1883, twenty-two of us who had been condemned\r\nto more than one year of imprisonment, were removed in great secrecy\r\nto the central prison of Clairvaux. It was formerly an abbey of St.\r\nBernard, of which the great Revolution had made a house for the poor.\r\nSubsequently it became a house of detention and correction, which\r\nwent among the prisoners and the officials themselves under the\r\nwell-deserved nickname of ‘house of detention and corruption.’\r\n\r\nSo long as we were kept at Lyons we were treated as the prisoners\r\nunder preliminary arrest are treated in France; that is, we had our\r\nown clothes, we could get our own food from a restaurant, and one\r\ncould hire for a few francs per month a larger cell, a _pistole_.\r\nI took advantage of this for working hard upon my articles for the\r\n‘Encyclopædia Britannica’ and the ‘Nineteenth Century.’ Now, the\r\ntreatment we should have at Clairvaux was an open question. However, in\r\nFrance it is generally understood that, for political prisoners, the\r\nloss of liberty and forced inactivity are in themselves so hard that\r\nthere is no need to inflict additional hardships. Consequently, we were\r\ntold that we should remain under the _régime_ of preliminary detention.\r\nWe should have separate quarters, retain our own clothes, be free from\r\ncompulsory work, and be allowed to smoke. ‘Those of you,’ the governor\r\nsaid, ‘who wish to earn something by manual work, will be enabled to\r\ndo so by sewing stays or engraving small things in mother-of-pearl.\r\nThis work is poorly paid; but you could not be employed in the prison\r\nworkshops for the fabrication of iron beds, picture frames, and so on,\r\nbecause that would require your lodging with the common-law prisoners.’\r\nLike the other prisoners we were allowed to buy from the prison canteen\r\nsome additional food and a pint of claret every day, both being\r\nsupplied at a very low price and of good quality.\r\n\r\nThe first impression which Clairvaux produced upon me was most\r\nfavourable. We had been locked up and had been travelling all the day,\r\nfrom two or three o’clock in the morning, in those tiny cupboards\r\ninto which the cellular railway carriages are usually divided. When\r\nwe reached the central prison we were taken temporarily to the\r\ncellular, or punishment quarters, and were introduced into the usual\r\nbut extremely clean cells. Hot food, plain but of excellent quality,\r\nhad been served to us notwithstanding the late hour of the night, and\r\nwe had been offered the opportunity of having the half-pint of very\r\ngood _vin du pays_ (local wine) which was sold to the prisoners by the\r\nprison canteen, at the extremely low price of 24 centimes (less than\r\n2½_d._) per quart. The governor and the warders were most polite to us.\r\n\r\nNext day the governor of the prison took me to see the rooms which he\r\nintended to give us, and when I remarked that they were all right but\r\nonly a little too small for such a number--we were twenty-two--and\r\nthat overcrowding might result in illness, he gave us another set of\r\nrooms in what was in olden times the house of the superintendent of\r\nthe abbey, and now was the hospital. Our windows looked out upon a\r\nlittle garden, and beyond it we had beautiful views of the surrounding\r\ncountry. In another room on the same landing old Blanqui had been kept\r\nthe last three or four years before his release. Before that he had\r\nbeen imprisoned in the cellular house.\r\n\r\nBesides the three spacious rooms which were given to us, a smaller\r\nroom was spared for Gautier and myself, so that we could pursue our\r\nliterary work. We probably owed this last favour to the intervention\r\nof a considerable number of English men of science who, as soon as I\r\nwas condemned, had addressed a petition to the President asking for my\r\nrelease. Many contributors to the ‘Encyclopædia Britannica,’ as well\r\nas Herbert Spencer and Swinburne, had signed, while Victor Hugo had\r\nadded to his signature a few warm words. Altogether, public opinion in\r\nFrance received our condemnation very unfavourably; and when my wife\r\nhad mentioned at Paris that I required books, the Academy of Sciences\r\noffered the use of its library, and Ernest Renan, in a charming letter,\r\nput his private library at her service.\r\n\r\nWe had a small garden, where we could play nine-pins or _jeu de\r\nboules_. We managed, moreover, to cultivate a narrow bed running\r\nalong the wall, and, on a surface of some eighty square yards, we\r\ngrew almost incredible quantities of lettuces and radishes, as well\r\nas some flowers. I need not say that we at once organized classes,\r\nand during the three years that we remained at Clairvaux I gave my\r\ncomrades lessons in cosmography, geometry, or physics, also aiding\r\nthem in the study of languages. Nearly every one learned at least one\r\nlanguage--English, German, Italian, or Spanish--while a few learned\r\ntwo. We also managed to do some book-binding, having learned how from\r\none of those excellent Encyclopédie Roret booklets.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the first year, however, my health again gave way.\r\nClairvaux is built on marshy ground, upon which malaria is endemic,\r\nand malaria, with scurvy, laid hold of me. Then my wife, who was\r\nstudying at Paris, working in Würtz’s laboratory and preparing to\r\ntake an examination for the degree of Doctor of Science, abandoned\r\neverything, and came to stay in the hamlet of Clairvaux, which consists\r\nof less than a dozen houses grouped at the foot of an immense high wall\r\nwhich encircles the prison. Of course, her life in that hamlet, with\r\nthe prison wall opposite, was anything but gay; yet she stayed there\r\ntill I was released. During the first year she was allowed to see me\r\nonly once in two months, and all interviews were held in the presence\r\nof a warder, who sat between us. But when she settled at Clairvaux,\r\ndeclaring her firm intention to remain there, she was soon permitted\r\nto see me every day, in one of the small guard-houses of the warders,\r\nwithin the prison walls, and food was brought me from the inn where she\r\nstayed. Later, we were even allowed to take a walk in the governor’s\r\ngarden, closely watched all the time, and usually one of my comrades\r\njoined us in the walk.\r\n\r\nI was quite astonished to discover that the central prison of Clairvaux\r\nhad all the aspects of a small manufacturing town, surrounded by\r\norchards and cornfields, all encircled by an outer wall. The fact\r\nis that if in a French central prison the inmates are perhaps more\r\ndependent upon the fancies and caprices of the governor and the\r\nwarders than they seem to be in English prisons, the treatment of the\r\nprisoners is far more humane than it is in the corresponding lock-ups\r\non this side of the Channel. The mediæval spirit of revenge which still\r\nprevails in English prisons has long since been given up in France.\r\nThe imprisoned man is not compelled to sleep on planks, or to have a\r\nmattress on alternate days only; the day he comes to the prison he gets\r\na decent bed and retains it. He is not compelled either to do degrading\r\nwork, such as to climb a wheel, or to pick oakum; he is employed, on\r\nthe contrary, in useful work, and this is why the Clairvaux prison\r\nhas the aspect of a manufacturing town in which iron furniture,\r\npicture-frames, looking-glasses, metric measures, velvet, linen,\r\nladies’ stays, small things in mother-of-pearl, wooden shoes, and so\r\non, are fabricated by the nearly 1,600 men who are kept there.\r\n\r\nMoreover, if the punishment for insubordination is very cruel, there\r\nis none of the flogging which still goes on in English prisons: such a\r\npunishment would be absolutely impossible in France. Altogether, the\r\ncentral prison at Clairvaux may be described as one of the best prisons\r\nin Europe. And yet, the results obtained at Clairvaux are as bad as in\r\nany one of the lock-ups of the old type. ‘The watchword nowadays is to\r\nsay that prisoners are reformed in our prisons,’ one of the members of\r\nthe prison administration once said to me. ‘This is all nonsense, and I\r\nshall never be induced to tell such a lie.’\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe pharmacy at Clairvaux was underneath the rooms which we occupied,\r\nand we occasionally had some contact with the prisoners who were\r\nemployed in it. One of them was a grey-haired man in his fifties,\r\nwho ended his term while we were there. It was touching to learn how\r\nhe parted with the prison. He knew that in a few months or weeks he\r\nwould be back, and begged the doctor to keep the place at the pharmacy\r\nopen for him. This was not his first visit to Clairvaux, and he knew\r\nit would not be the last. When he was set free he had not a soul in\r\nthe world to whom he might go to spend his old age. ‘Who will care\r\nto employ me?’ he said. ‘And what trade have I? None! When I am out\r\nI must go to my old comrades; they, at least, will surely receive me\r\nas an old friend.’ Then would come a glass too much of drink in their\r\ncompany, excited talk about some capital fun--some capital ‘new stroke’\r\nto be made in the way of theft--and, partly from weakness of will,\r\npartly to oblige his only friends, he would join in it, and would be\r\nlocked up once more. So it had been several times before in his life.\r\nTwo months passed, however, after his release, and he was not yet\r\nback to Clairvaux. Then the prisoners, and the warders too, began to\r\nfeel uneasy about him. ‘Has he had time to move to another judicial\r\ndistrict, that he is not yet back? One can only hope that he has not\r\nbeen involved in some bad affair,’ they would say, meaning something\r\nworse than theft. ‘That would be a pity: he was such a nice, quiet\r\nman.’ But it soon appeared that the first supposition was the right\r\none. Word came from another prison that the old man was locked up\r\nthere, and was now endeavouring to be transferred to Clairvaux.\r\n\r\nThe old prisoners were the most pitiful sight. Many of them had begun\r\ntheir prison experience in childhood or early youth, others at a riper\r\nage. But ‘once in prison, always in prison,’ such is the saying derived\r\nfrom experience. And now, having reached or passed over the age of\r\nsixty, they knew that they must end their lives in a gaol. To quicken\r\ntheir departure from life the prison administration used to send them\r\nto the workshops where felt socks were made out of all sorts of woollen\r\nrefuse. The dust in the workshop soon gave these old men consumption,\r\nwhich finally released them. Then four fellow prisoners would carry the\r\nold comrade to the common grave, the graveyard warder and his black dog\r\nbeing the only two beings to follow him; and while the prison priest\r\nwould march in front of the procession, mechanically reciting his\r\nprayer and looking round at the chestnut or fir-trees along the road,\r\nand the four comrades carrying the coffin would enjoy their momentary\r\nescape out of prison, the black dog would be the only being affected by\r\nthe solemnity of the ceremony.\r\n\r\nWhen the reformed central prisons were introduced in France, it was\r\nbelieved that the principle of absolute silence could be maintained in\r\nthem. But it is so contrary to human nature that its strict enforcement\r\nhad to be abandoned. In fact, even solitary confinement is no obstacle\r\nto intercourse between the prisoners.\r\n\r\nTo the outward observer the prison seems to be quite mute; but in\r\nreality life goes on in it as busily as in a small town. In suppressed\r\nvoices, by means of whispers, hurriedly dropped words, and scraps of\r\nnotes, every news of any interest spreads immediately all over the\r\nprison. Nothing can happen either among the prisoners themselves, or\r\nin the _cour d’honneur_, where the lodgings of the administration are\r\nsituated, or in the village of Clairvaux, where the employers of the\r\nfactories live, or in the wide world of Paris politics, but that it\r\nis communicated at once throughout all the dormitories, workshops,\r\nand cells. Frenchmen are of too communicative a nature for their\r\nunderground telegraph ever to be stopped. We had no intercourse with\r\nthe common-law prisoners, and yet we knew all the news of the day.\r\n‘John, the gardener, is back for two years.’ ‘Such an inspector’s wife\r\nhas had a fearful scrimmage with So-and-So’s wife.’ ‘James, in the\r\ncells, has been caught transmitting a note of friendship to John from\r\nthe framers’ workshop.’ ‘That old beast So-and-So is no more minister\r\nof justice: the ministry has been upset.’ And so on; and when the news\r\ngoes that ‘Jack has got two five-penny packets of tobacco in exchange\r\nfor two flannel spencers,’ it flies round the prison in no time.\r\n\r\nDemands for tobacco were continually pouring in upon us; and when a\r\nsmall lawyer detained in the prison wanted to transmit to me a note, in\r\norder to ask my wife, who was staying in the village, to see from time\r\nto time his wife, who was also there, quite a number of men took the\r\nliveliest interest in the transmission of that message, which had to\r\npass I do not know how many hands before it reached its goal. And when\r\nthere was something that might specially interest us in a paper, this\r\npaper, in some unaccountable way, would reach us, with a little stone\r\nwrapped into it, to help its being thrown over a high wall.\r\n\r\nCellular imprisonment is no obstacle to communication. When we came\r\nto Clairvaux and were first lodged in the cellular quarter, it was\r\nbitterly cold in the cells; so cold, indeed, that when I wrote to\r\nmy wife, who was then at Paris, and she got my letter, she did not\r\nrecognize the writing, my hand being so stiff with the cold. The order\r\ncame to heat the cells as much as possible; but do what they might,\r\nthe cells remained as cold as ever. It appeared afterwards that all\r\nthe hot-air tubes in the cells were choked with scraps of paper, bits\r\nof notes, penknives, and all sorts of small things which several\r\ngenerations of prisoners had concealed in the pipes.\r\n\r\nMartin, the same friend of mine whom I have already mentioned, obtained\r\npermission to serve part of his time in cellular confinement. He\r\npreferred isolation to life in a room with a dozen comrades, and went\r\nto a cell in the cellular building. To his great astonishment he found\r\nthat he was not at all alone in his cell. The walls and the keyholes\r\nspoke round him. In a day or two all the inmates of the cells knew who\r\nhe was, and he had acquaintances all over the building. Quite a life\r\ngoes on, as in a beehive, between the seemingly isolated cells; only\r\nthat life often takes such a character as to make it belong entirely\r\nto the domain of psychopathy. Kraft-Ebbing himself had no idea of the\r\naspects it takes with certain prisoners in solitary confinement.\r\n\r\nI will not repeat here what I have said in a book, ‘In Russian and\r\nFrench Prisons,’ which I published in England in 1886, soon after my\r\nrelease from Clairvaux, upon the moral influence of prisoners upon\r\nprisoners. But there is one thing which must be said. The prison\r\npopulation consists of heterogeneous elements; but, taking only those\r\nwho are usually described as ‘the criminals’ proper, and of whom we\r\nhave heard so much lately from Lombroso and his followers, what struck\r\nme most as regards them was that the prisons, which are considered\r\nas a preventive measure against anti-social deeds, are exactly the\r\ninstitutions for breeding them and for rendering these offences\r\nworse and worse after a man has received prison education. Everyone\r\nknows that the absence of education, the dislike of regular work\r\nacquired since childhood, the physical unpreparedness for sustained\r\neffort, the love of adventure when it receives a wrong direction,\r\nthe gambling propensities, the absence of energy and an untrained\r\nwill, and carelessness about the happiness of others, are the causes\r\nwhich bring this category of men before the courts. Now I was deeply\r\nimpressed during my imprisonment by the fact that it is exactly these\r\ndefects of human nature--each one of them--which the prison breeds in\r\nits inmates; and it is bound to breed them because it is a prison,\r\nand will breed them so long as there are prisons. Incarceration in a\r\nprison necessarily, fatally, destroys the energy of a man, and still\r\nmore kills his will. In prison life there is no room for exercising\r\none’s will. To possess one’s own will in prison means surely to get\r\ninto trouble. The will of the prisoner _must_ be killed, and it\r\nis killed. Still less is there room for exercising one’s natural\r\nsympathies, everything being done to destroy free contact with those\r\noutside the prison and within it with whom the prisoner may have\r\nfeelings of sympathy. Physically and mentally he is rendered less\r\nand less prepared for sustained effort; and if he has had formerly\r\na dislike for regular work, this dislike is only the more increased\r\nduring his prison years. If, before he first came to the prison, he\r\nsoon felt tired by monotonous work, which he could not do properly,\r\nor had a grudge against underpaid overwork, his dislike now becomes\r\nhatred. If he doubted about the social utility of current rules of\r\nmorality, now, after having cast a critical glance upon the official\r\ndefenders of these rules, and learned his comrades’ opinions of them,\r\nhe openly casts the rules overboard. And if he has got into trouble in\r\nconsequence of a morbid development of the passionate sensual side of\r\nhis nature, now, after having spent a number of years in prison, this\r\nmorbid character is still more developed--in many cases to an appalling\r\nextent. In this last direction--the most dangerous of all--prison\r\neducation is most effective.\r\n\r\nIn Siberia I had seen what sinks of filth, and what workshops of\r\nphysical and moral deterioration the dirty, overcrowded, ‘unreformed’\r\nRussian prisons were, and at the age of nineteen I imagined that if\r\nthere were less overcrowding in the rooms, and a certain classification\r\nof the prisoners, and healthy occupations were provided for them,\r\nthe institution might be substantially improved. Now, I had to part\r\nwith these illusions. I could convince myself that as regards their\r\neffects upon the prisoners, and their results for society at large,\r\nthe best ‘reformed’ prisons--whether cellular or not--are as bad as,\r\nor even worse, than the dirty lock-ups of old. They do not ‘reform’\r\nthe prisoners. On the contrary, in the immense, overwhelming majority\r\nof cases, they exercise upon them the most deteriorating effect. The\r\nthief, the swindler, the rough man, and so on, who has spent some\r\nyears in a prison, comes out of it more ready than ever to resume his\r\nformer career; he is better prepared for it; he has learned how to do\r\nit better; he is more embittered against society, and he finds a more\r\nsolid justification for being in revolt against its laws and customs;\r\nnecessarily, unavoidably, he is bound to go farther and farther along\r\nthe anti-social path which first brought him before a law court. The\r\noffences he will commit after his release will be graver than those\r\nwhich first got him into trouble; and he is doomed to finish his life\r\nin a prison or in a hard-labour colony. In the above-mentioned book\r\nI wrote that prisons are ‘universities of crime, maintained by the\r\nstate.’ And now, thinking of it at fifteen years’ distance, in the\r\nlight of my subsequent experience, I can only confirm that statement of\r\nmine.\r\n\r\nPersonally I have no reason whatever to complain of the years I have\r\nspent in a French prison. For an active and independent man the\r\nrestraint of liberty and activity is in itself so great a privation\r\nthat all the remainder, all the petty miseries of prison life, are not\r\nworth speaking of. Of course, when we heard of the active political\r\nlife which was going on in France, we resented very much our forced\r\ninactivity. The end of the first year, especially during a gloomy\r\nwinter, is always hard for the prisoner. And when spring comes, one\r\nfeels more strongly than ever the want of liberty. When I saw from our\r\nwindows the meadows assuming their green garb, and the hills covered\r\nwith a spring haze, or when I saw a train flying into a dale between\r\nthe hills, I certainly felt a strong desire to follow it, to breathe\r\nthe air of the woods, to be carried along with the stream of human life\r\ninto a busy town. But one who casts his lot with an advanced party\r\nmust be prepared to spend a number of years in prison, and he need not\r\ngrudge it. He feels that even during his imprisonment he remains not\r\nquite an inactive part of the stream of human progress which spreads\r\nand strengthens the ideas which are dear to him.\r\n\r\nAt Lyons my comrades, my wife, and myself certainly found the warders\r\na very rough set of men. But after a couple of encounters all was\r\nset right. Moreover, the prison administration knew that we had the\r\nParis press with us, and they did not want to draw upon themselves\r\nthe thunders of Rochefort or the cutting criticisms of Clémenceau.\r\nAnd at Clairvaux there was no need of such a restraint. All the\r\nadministration had been renewed a few months before we came thither.\r\nA prisoner had been killed by warders in his cell, and his corpse had\r\nbeen hanged to simulate suicide; but this time the affair leaked out\r\nthrough the doctor; the governor was dismissed, and altogether a better\r\ntone prevailed in the prison. I took back from Clairvaux the best\r\nrecollections of its governor; and altogether, while I was there, I\r\nmore than once thought that, after all, men are often better than the\r\ninstitutions to which they belong. But having no personal griefs, I can\r\nall the more freely, and most unconditionally condemn the institution\r\nitself, as a survival from the dark past, wrong in its principles, and\r\na source of unfathomable evil to society.\r\n\r\nOne thing more I must mention as it struck me, perhaps, even more\r\nthan the demoralising effects of prisons upon their inmates. What\r\na nest of infection is every prison, and even a law court for its\r\nneighbourhood--for the people who live about them. Lombroso has made\r\nvery much of the ‘criminal type’ which he believes to have discovered\r\namongst the inmates of the prisons. If he had made the same efforts\r\nto observe people who hang about the law courts--detectives, spies,\r\nsmall solicitors, informers, people preying upon simpletons, and the\r\nlike--he would have probably concluded that his ‘criminal type’ has a\r\nfar greater geographical extension than the prison walls. I never saw\r\nsuch a collection of faces of the lowest human type, sunk far below\r\nthe average type of mankind, as I saw by the score round and within\r\nthe Palais de Justice at Lyons. Certainly not within the prison walls\r\nof Clairvaux. Dickens and Cruikshank have immortalized a few of these\r\ntypes; but they represent quite a world which gravitates round the law\r\ncourts, and infuses its infection far and wide around them. And the\r\nsame is true of each central prison like Clairvaux. Quite an atmosphere\r\nof petty thefts, petty swindlings, spying and corruption of all sorts\r\nspreads like a blot of oil round every prison.\r\n\r\nI saw all this; and if before my condemnation I already knew that\r\nsociety is wrong in its present system of punishments, after I left\r\nClairvaux I knew that it is not only wrong and unjust in this system,\r\nbut that it is simply foolish when, in its partly unconscious and\r\npartly wilful ignorance of realities, it maintains at its own expense\r\nthese universities of crime and these sinks of corruption, acting\r\nunder the illusion that they are necessary as a bridle to the criminal\r\ninstincts of man.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nEvery revolutionist meets a number of spies and _agents provocateurs_\r\nin his path, and I have had my fair share of them. All governments\r\nspend considerable sums of money in maintaining this kind of reptile.\r\nHowever, they are mainly dangerous to young people. One who has had\r\nsome experience of life and men soon discovers that there is about\r\nthese creatures something which puts him on his guard. They are\r\nrecruited from the scum of society, amongst men of the lowest moral\r\nstandard, and if one is watchful of the moral character of the men he\r\nmeets with, he soon notices something in the manners of these ‘pillars\r\nof society’ which shocks him, and then he asks himself the question:\r\n‘What has brought this person to me? What in the world can he have in\r\ncommon with us?’ In most cases this simple question is sufficient to\r\nput a man upon his guard.\r\n\r\nWhen I first came to Geneva, the agent of the Russian government who\r\nhad been commissioned to spy the refugees was well known to all of us.\r\nHe went under the name of Count Something; but as he had no footman and\r\nno carriage on which to emblazon his coronet and arms, he had had them\r\nembroidered on a sort of mantle which covered his tiny dog. We saw him\r\noccasionally in the cafés, without speaking to him; he was, in fact, an\r\n‘innocent’ who simply bought in the kiosques all the publications of\r\nthe exiles, very probably adding to them such comments as he thought\r\nwould please his chiefs.\r\n\r\nDifferent men began to pour in when Geneva was peopled with more and\r\nmore refugees of the young generation; and yet, in one way or another,\r\nthey also became known to us.\r\n\r\nWhen a stranger appeared on our horizon, he was asked with usual\r\nnihilist frankness about his past and his present prospects, and it\r\nsoon appeared what sort of person he or she was. Frankness in mutual\r\nintercourse is altogether the best way for bringing about proper\r\nrelations between men. In this case it was invaluable. Numbers of\r\npersons whom none of us had known or heard of in Russia--absolute\r\nstrangers to the circles--came to Geneva, and many of them, a few days\r\nor even hours after their arrival, stood on the most friendly terms\r\nwith the colony of refugees; but in some way or another the spies\r\nnever succeeded in crossing the threshold of familiarity. A spy might\r\nmake common acquaintances; he might give the best accounts, sometimes\r\ncorrect, of his past in Russia; he might possess in perfection\r\nthe nihilist slang and manners, but he never could assimilate the\r\nparticular kind of nihilist ethics which had grown up amongst the\r\nRussian youth--and this alone kept him at a distance from our colony.\r\nSpies can imitate anything else but those ethics.\r\n\r\nWhen I was working with Reclus there was at Clarens one such\r\nindividual, from whom we all kept aloof. We knew nothing bad about him,\r\nbut we felt that he was not ‘ours,’ and as he tried only the more to\r\npenetrate into our society, we became suspicious of him. I had never\r\nsaid a word to him, and consequently he was especially after me. Seeing\r\nthat he could not approach me through the usual channels, he began to\r\nwrite me letters, giving me mysterious appointments for mysterious\r\npurposes in the woods and in similar places. For fun, I once accepted\r\nhis invitation and went to the spot, with a good friend following me\r\nat a distance; but the man, who probably had a confederate, must have\r\nnoticed that I was not alone, and did not appear. So I was spared the\r\npleasure of ever saying to him a single word. Besides, I worked at that\r\ntime so hard that every minute of my time was taken up either with\r\nthe Geography or ‘Le Révolté,’ and I entered into no conspiracies.\r\nHowever, we learned later on that this man used to send to the Third\r\nSection detailed reports about the supposed conversations which he had\r\nhad with me, my supposed confidences, and the terrible plots which I\r\nwas concocting at St. Petersburg against the Tsar’s life! All that\r\nwas taken for ready money at St. Petersburg. And in Italy, too. When\r\nCafiero was arrested one day in Switzerland, he was shown formidable\r\nreports of Italian spies, who warned their government that Cafiero and\r\nI, loaded with bombs, were going to enter Italy. The fact was that I\r\nnever was in Italy, and never had had any intention of visiting the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, however, the spies do not always fabricate reports\r\nwholesale. They often tell things that are true, but all depends upon\r\nthe way a story is told. We passed some merry moments about a report\r\nwhich was addressed to the French government by a French spy who\r\nfollowed my wife and myself as we were travelling in 1881 from Paris\r\nto London. The spy, probably playing a double part--as they often\r\ndo--had sold that report to Rochefort, who published it in his paper.\r\nEverything that the spy had told in this report was correct--but the\r\nway he had told it!\r\n\r\nHe wrote for instance: ‘I took the next compartment to the one that\r\nKropótkin had taken with his wife.’ Quite true; he was there. We\r\nnoticed him, for he had managed at once to attract our attention by his\r\nsullen, unpleasant face. ‘They spoke Russian all the time, in order\r\nnot to be understood by the other passengers.’ Very true again: we\r\nspoke Russian as we always do. ‘When they came to Calais, they both\r\ntook a _bouillon_.’ Most correct again: we took a _bouillon_. But here\r\nthe mysterious part of the journey begins. ‘After that, they both\r\nsuddenly disappeared, and I looked for them in vain, on the platform\r\nand elsewhere; and when they reappeared, he was in disguise, and was\r\nfollowed by a Russian priest, who never left him until they reached\r\nLondon, where I lost sight of the priest.’ All that was true again. My\r\nwife had a slight toothache, and I asked the keeper of the restaurant\r\nto let us go into his private room, where the tooth could be stopped.\r\nSo we had disappeared indeed; and as we had to cross the Channel, I\r\nput my soft felt hat into my pocket and put on a fur cap: so I was ‘in\r\ndisguise.’ As to the mysterious priest, he was also there. He was not a\r\nRussian, but this is irrelevant: he wore at any rate the dress of the\r\nGreek priests. I saw him standing at the counter and asking something\r\nwhich no one understood. ‘Agua, agua,’ he repeated in a woful tone.\r\n‘Give the gentleman a glass of water,’ I said to the waiter. Whereupon\r\nthe priest began to thank me for my intervention with a truly Eastern\r\neffusion. My wife took pity on him and spoke to him in different\r\nlanguages, but he understood none but modern Greek. It appeared at last\r\nthat he knew a few words in one of the South Slavonian languages, and\r\nwe could make out: ‘I am a Greek; Turkish embassy, London.’ We told\r\nhim, mostly by signs, that we too were going to London, and that he\r\nmight travel with us.\r\n\r\nThe most amusing part of the story was that I really found for him the\r\naddress of the Turkish embassy, even before we had reached Charing\r\nCross. The train stopped at some station on the way, and two elegant\r\nladies entered our already full third-class compartment. Both had\r\nnewspapers in their hands. One was English, and the other--a tall,\r\nnice-looking person, who spoke good French--pretended to be English.\r\nAfter having exchanged a few words, she asked me _à brûle-pourpoint_:\r\n‘What do you think of Count Ignátieff?’ And immediately after that:\r\n‘Are you soon going to kill the new Tsar?’ I was clear as to her\r\nprofession from these two questions; but, thinking of my priest, I said\r\nto her: ‘Do you happen to know the address of the Turkish embassy?’\r\n‘Street So-and so, number So-and-so,’ she replied without hesitation,\r\nlike a schoolgirl in a class. ‘You could, I suppose, also give the\r\naddress of the Russian embassy?’ I asked her, and the address having\r\nbeen given with the same readiness, I communicated both to the priest.\r\nWhen we reached Charing Cross, the lady was so obsequiously anxious\r\nto attend to my luggage, and even to carry a heavy package herself\r\nwith her gloved hands, that I finally told her, much to her surprise:\r\n‘Enough of that; ladies do not carry gentlemen’s luggage. Go away!’\r\n\r\nBut to return to my trustworthy French spy. ‘He alighted at Charing\r\nCross’--he wrote in his report--‘but for more than half an hour after\r\nthe arrival of the train he did not leave the station, until he had\r\nascertained that everyone else had left it. I kept aloof in the\r\nmeantime, concealing myself behind a pillar. Having ascertained that\r\nall passengers had left the platform, they both suddenly jumped into a\r\ncab. I followed them nevertheless, and overheard the address which the\r\ncabman gave at the gate to the policeman--12, street So-and-so--and ran\r\nafter the cab. There were no cabs in the neighbourhood; so I ran up\r\nto Trafalgar Square, where I got one. I then drove after him, and he\r\nalighted at the above address.’\r\n\r\nAll facts in this narrative are true again--the address and the rest;\r\nbut how mysterious it all reads. I had warned a Russian friend of\r\nmy arrival, but there was a dense fog that morning, and my friend\r\noverslept himself. We waited for him half an hour, and then, leaving\r\nour luggage in the cloak-room, drove to his house.\r\n\r\n‘There they sat till two o’clock with drawn curtains, and then a tall\r\nman came out of the house, and returned one hour later with their\r\nluggage.’ Even the remark about the curtains was correct: we had to\r\nlight the gas on account of the fog, and drew down the curtains to get\r\nrid of the ugly sight of a small Islington street wrapped in a dense\r\nfog.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen I was working with Elisée Reclus at Clarens I used to go every\r\nfortnight to Geneva to see to the bringing out of ‘Le Révolté.’\r\nOne day as I came to our printing office, I was told that a Russian\r\ngentleman wanted to see me. He had already seen my friends and had\r\ntold them that he came to induce me to start a paper like ‘Le Révolté’\r\nin Russian. He offered for that purpose all the money that might be\r\nrequired. I went to meet him in a café, where he gave me a German\r\nname--Tohnlehm, let us say--and told me that he was a native of the\r\nBaltic provinces. He boasted of possessing a large fortune in certain\r\nestates and manufactures, and he was extremely angry with the Russian\r\nGovernment, for their Russianizing schemes. On the whole he produced\r\na somewhat indefinite impression, so that my friends insisted upon my\r\naccepting his offer; but I did not much like the man from first sight.\r\n\r\nFrom the café he took me to his rooms in an hotel, and there began to\r\nshow less reserve and to appear more like himself and in a still more\r\nunpleasant light. ‘Don’t doubt my fortune,’ he said to me; ‘I have\r\nmade a capital invention. There’s a lot of money in it. I shall patent\r\nit, and get a considerable sum for it, and give it all for the cause\r\nof the revolution in Russia.’ And he showed me, to my astonishment, a\r\nmiserable candlestick, the originality of which was that it was awfully\r\nugly and had three bits of wire to put the candle in. The poorest\r\nhousewife would not have cared for such a candlestick, and even if it\r\ncould have been patented, no ironmonger would have paid the patentee\r\nmore than a couple of sovereigns. ‘A rich man placing his hopes on such\r\na candlestick! This man,’ I thought to myself, ‘can never have seen\r\nbetter ones,’ and my opinion about him was made up: ‘He was no rich man\r\nat all, and the money he offered was not his own.’ So I bluntly told\r\nhim: ‘Very well, if you are so anxious to have a Russian revolutionary\r\npaper, and hold the flattering opinion about myself which you have\r\nexpressed, you will have to put your money in my name at a bank, and\r\nat my entire disposal. But I warn you that you will have absolutely\r\nnothing to do with the paper.’ ‘Of course, of course,’ he said, ‘but\r\njust see to it, and sometimes advise you, and aid you in smuggling it\r\ninto Russia.’ ‘No, nothing of the sort! You need not see me at all.’ My\r\nfriends thought that I was too hard upon the man, but some time after\r\nthat a letter was received from St. Petersburg warning us that we would\r\nhave the visit of a spy of the Third Section--Tohnlehm by name. The\r\ncandlestick had thus rendered us a good service.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCandlesticks, or anything else, these people almost always betray\r\nthemselves in one way or another. When we were at London in 1881 we\r\nreceived, on a foggy morning, the visit of two Russians. I knew one\r\nof them by name; the other, a young man whom he recommended as his\r\nfriend, was a stranger. He had volunteered to accompany his friend on\r\na few days’ visit to England. As he was introduced by a friend, I had\r\nno suspicions whatever about him; but I was very busy that day with\r\nsome work, and asked another friend who stayed close by to find them\r\nrooms and to take them about to see London. My wife had not yet seen\r\nLondon either, and she went with them. In the afternoon she returned\r\nsaying to me: ‘Do you know, I dislike that man very much. Beware of\r\nhim.’ ‘But why? What’s the matter?’ I asked. ‘Nothing, absolutely\r\nnothing; but he is surely not “ours.” By the way he treated the waiter\r\nin a café, and the way he handles money, I saw at once that he is not\r\n“ours,” and if he is not--why should he come to us?’ She was so certain\r\nof her suspicions that, while she performed her duties of hospitality,\r\nshe nevertheless managed never to leave that young man alone in my\r\nstudy, even for one minute. We had a chat, and the visitor began to\r\nexhibit himself more and more under such a low moral aspect that even\r\nhis friend blushed for him, and when I asked more details about him,\r\nthe explanations he gave were even still less satisfactory. We were\r\nboth on our guard. In short, they both left London in a couple of\r\ndays, and a fortnight later I got a letter from my Russian friend,\r\nfull of excuses for having introduced to me the young man who, they\r\nhad found out, at Paris, was a spy in the service of the Russian\r\nembassy. I looked then into a list of Russian secret service agents\r\nin France and Switzerland which we, the refugees, had received lately\r\nfrom the Executive Committee--they had their men everywhere at St.\r\nPetersburg--and I found the name of that young man on the list, with\r\none letter only altered in it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo start a paper, subsidized by the police, with a police agent at its\r\nhead, is an old plan, and the prefect of the Paris police, Andrieux,\r\nresorted to it in 1881. I was with Elisée Reclus in the mountains\r\nwhen we received a letter from a Frenchman, or rather a Belgian, who\r\nannounced to us that he was going to start an anarchist paper at\r\nParis and asked our collaboration. The letter, full of flatteries,\r\nproduced upon us an unpleasant impression, and Reclus had moreover\r\nsome vague reminiscence of having heard the name of the writer in some\r\nunfavourable connection. We decided to refuse collaboration, and I\r\nwrote to a Paris friend that we must first of all ascertain from whence\r\nthe money came with which the paper was going to be started. ‘It may\r\ncome from the Orleanists--an old trick of the family--and we must know\r\nits origin.’ My Paris friend, with a workman’s straightforwardness,\r\nread that letter at a meeting at which the would-be editor of the paper\r\nwas present. He simulated offence, and I had to answer several letters\r\non this subject; but I stuck to my words: ‘If the man is in earnest, he\r\nmust show us the origin of the money.’\r\n\r\nAnd so he did at last. Pressed by questions he said that the money\r\ncame from his aunt--a rich lady of antiquated opinions who yielded,\r\nhowever, to his fancy of having a paper and had parted with the money.\r\nThe lady was not in France; she was staying at London. We insisted\r\nnevertheless upon having her name and address, and our friend Malatesta\r\nvolunteered to see her. He went with an Italian friend who was\r\nconnected with the second-hand trade in furniture. They found the lady\r\noccupying a small flat, and while Malatesta spoke to her and was more\r\nand more convinced that she was simply playing the aunt’s part in the\r\ncomedy, the furniture-friend, looking round at the chairs and tables,\r\ndiscovered that all of them had been taken the day before--probably\r\nhired--from a second-hand furniture dealer, his neighbour. The labels\r\nof the dealer were still fastened to the chairs and the tables.\r\nThis did not prove much, but naturally reinforced our suspicions. I\r\nabsolutely refused to have anything to do with the paper.\r\n\r\nThe paper was of an unheard-of violence. Burning, assassination,\r\ndynamite bombs--there was nothing but that in it. I met the man,\r\nthe editor of the paper, as I went to the London congress, and the\r\nmoment I saw his sullen face, and heard a bit of his talk, and caught\r\na glance of the sort of women with whom he always went about, my\r\nopinions concerning him were settled. At the congress, during which he\r\nintroduced all sorts of terrible resolutions, the delegates kept aloof\r\nfrom him; and when he insisted upon having the addresses of anarchists\r\nall over the world, the refusal was made in anything but a flattering\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nTo make a long story short, he was unmasked a couple of months later,\r\nand the paper was stopped for ever on the very next day. Then, a couple\r\nof years after that, the prefect of police, Andrieux, published his\r\n‘Memoirs,’ and in this book he told all about the paper which he had\r\nstarted and the explosions which his agents had organized at Paris,\r\nby putting sardine boxes filled with ‘something’ under the statue of\r\nThiers.\r\n\r\nOne can imagine the quantities of money all these things cost the\r\nFrench and every other nation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI might write several chapters on this subject, but I will mention only\r\none more story of two adventurers at Clairvaux.\r\n\r\nMy wife stayed in the only inn of the little village which has grown\r\nup under the shadow of the prison wall. One day the landlady entered\r\nher room with a message from two gentlemen, who came to the hotel and\r\nwanted to see my wife. The landlady interceded with all her eloquence\r\nin their favour. ‘Oh, I know the world,’ she said, ‘and I may assure\r\nyou, madame, that they are the most correct gentlemen. Nothing could be\r\nmore _comme-il-faut_. One of them gave the name of a German officer.\r\nHe is surely a baron or a “milord,” and the other is his interpreter.\r\nThey know you perfectly well. The baron is going now to Africa, perhaps\r\nnever to return, and he wants to see you before he leaves.’\r\n\r\nMy wife looked at the address of the message, which was: ‘A Madame\r\nla Principesse Kropotkine,’ and needed no further proof of the\r\n_comme-el-faut_ of the two gentlemen. As to the contents of the\r\nmessage, they were even worse than the address. Against all rules\r\nof grammar and common-sense the ‘baron’ wrote about a mysterious\r\ncommunication which he had to make. She refused point-blank to receive\r\nthe baron and his interpreter.\r\n\r\nThereupon the baron wrote to my wife letter upon letter, which she\r\nreturned unopened. All the village soon became divided into two\r\nparties--one siding with the baron and led by the landlady, and the\r\nother against him, and headed, as a matter of fact, by the landlady’s\r\nhusband. Quite a romance was circulated. ‘The baron had known my wife\r\nbefore her marriage. He had danced with her many times at the Russian\r\nembassy in Vienna. He was still in love with her, but she, the cruel\r\none, refused even to allow him to cast a glance at her before he went\r\nupon his perilous expedition....’\r\n\r\nThen came the mysterious story of a boy whom we were said to conceal.\r\n‘Where is their boy?’ the baron wanted to know. ‘They have a son, six\r\nyears old by this time--where is he?’ ‘She never would part with a boy\r\nif she had one,’ the one party said. ‘Yes, they have one, but they\r\nconceal him,’ the other party maintained.\r\n\r\nFor us two, this contest was a very interesting revelation. It proved\r\nthat our letters were not only read by the prison authorities, but that\r\ntheir contents were made known to the Russian embassy as well. When I\r\nwas at Lyons, and my wife went to see Elisée Reclus in Switzerland,\r\nshe wrote to me once that ‘our boy’ was going on well; his health was\r\nexcellent, and they all spent a very nice evening at the anniversary\r\nof his fifth birthday. I knew that she meant ‘Le Révolté,’ which we\r\noften used to name in conversation ‘our _gamin_’--our naughty boy. But\r\nnow that these gentlemen were inquiring about ‘our _gamin_,’ and even\r\ndesignated so correctly his age, it was evident that the letter had\r\npassed through other hands than those of the governor. It was well to\r\nknow such a thing.\r\n\r\nNothing escapes the attention of village folk in the country, and the\r\nbaron soon awakened suspicions. He wrote a new letter to my wife, even\r\nmore loquacious than the former ones. Now, he asked her pardon for\r\nhaving tried to introduce himself as an acquaintance. He owned that she\r\ndid not know him; but nevertheless he was a well-wisher. He had to make\r\nto her a most important communication. My life was in danger and he\r\nwanted to warn her. The baron and his secretary took an outing in the\r\nfields to read together that letter and to consult about its tenor--the\r\nforest-guard following them at a distance--but they quarrelled about\r\nit, and the letter was torn to pieces and thrown in the fields. The\r\nforester waited till they were out of sight, gathered the pieces,\r\nconnected them, and read the letter. In one hour’s time the village\r\nknew that the baron had never really been acquainted with my wife;\r\nthe romance which was so sentimentally repeated by the baron’s party\r\ncrumbled to pieces.\r\n\r\n‘Ah, then, they are not what they pretended to be,’ the _brigadier\r\nde gendarmerie_ concluded in his turn; ‘then they must be German\r\nspies’--and he arrested them.\r\n\r\nIt must be said in his excuse that a German spy had really been at\r\nClairvaux shortly before. In time of war the vast buildings of the\r\nprison might serve as depôts for provisions or barracks for the army,\r\nand the German General Staff was surely interested to know the inner\r\ncapacity of the prison buildings. A jovial travelling photographer came\r\naccordingly to our village, made friends with everyone by photographing\r\nthem for nothing, and was admitted to photograph, not only the inside\r\nof the prison yards, but also the dormitories. Having done this, he\r\ntravelled to some other town on the eastern frontier, and was there\r\narrested by the French authorities as a man found in possession\r\nof compromising military documents. The brigadier, fresh from the\r\nimpression of the photographer’s visit, jumped to the conclusion that\r\nthe baron and his secretary were also German spies, and took them in\r\ncustody to the little town of Bar-sur-Aube. There they were released\r\nnext morning, the local paper stating that they were not German spies\r\nbut ‘persons commissioned by another more friendly power.’\r\n\r\nNow public opinion turned entirely against the baron and his secretary,\r\nwho had to live through more adventures. After their release they\r\nentered a small village café, and there ventilated their griefs in\r\nGerman in a friendly conversation over a bottle of wine. ‘You were\r\nstupid, you were a coward,’ the would-be interpreter said to the\r\nwould-be baron. ‘If _I_ had been in your place, I would have shot that\r\nexamining magistrate with this revolver. Let him only repeat that with\r\n_me_--he will have these bullets in his head!’ And so on.\r\n\r\nA commercial traveller who quietly sat in the corner of the room,\r\nrushed at once to the brigadier to report the conversation which he\r\nhad overheard. The brigadier made at once an official report, and once\r\nmore arrested the secretary--a pharmacist from Strasburg. He was taken\r\nbefore a police court at the same town of Bar-sur-Aube, and got a full\r\nmonth’s imprisonment for ‘menaces uttered against a magistrate in a\r\npublic place.’ At last the two adventurers left Clairvaux.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese spy adventures ended in a comical way. But how many\r\ntragedies--terrible tragedies--we owe to these villains! Precious\r\nlives lost, and whole families wrecked, simply to get an easy living\r\nfor such swindlers. When one thinks of the thousands of spies going\r\nabout the world in the pay of all governments; of the traps they lay\r\nfor all sorts of artless people; of the lives they sometimes bring\r\nto a tragical end, and the sorrows they sow broadcast; of the vast\r\nsums of money thrown away in the maintenance of that army recruited\r\nfrom the scum of society; of the corruption of all sorts which they\r\npour into society at large, nay, even into families, one cannot but\r\nbe appalled at the immensity of the evil which is thus done. And this\r\narmy of villains is not only limited to those who play the spy on\r\nrevolutionists or to the military espionage system. In this country\r\nthere are papers, especially in the watering towns, whose columns\r\nare covered with advertisements of private detective agencies which\r\nundertake to collect all sorts of information for divorce suits, to spy\r\nupon husbands for their wives and upon wives for their husbands, to\r\npenetrate into families and entrap simpletons, and who will undertake\r\nanything which may be asked of them, for a corresponding sum of money.\r\nAnd while people feel scandalized at the espionage villainies lately\r\nrevealed in the highest military spheres of France, they do not notice\r\nthat amongst themselves, perhaps under their own roofs, the same and\r\neven worse things are being committed by both the official and private\r\ndetective agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nDemands for our release were continually raised, both in the Press and\r\nin the Chamber of Deputies--the more so as about the same time that we\r\nwere condemned Louise Michel was condemned, too--for robbery. Louise\r\nMichel, who always gives literally her last shawl or cloak to the woman\r\nwho is in need of it, and who never could be compelled, during her\r\nimprisonment, to have better food, because she always gave her fellow\r\nprisoners what was sent to her, was condemned, together with another\r\ncomrade, Pouget, to nine years’ imprisonment for highway robbery! That\r\nsounded too bad even for the middle-class opportunists. She marched\r\none day at the head of a procession of the unemployed, and, entering\r\na baker’s shop, took a few loaves from it and distributed them to the\r\nhungry column: this was her robbery. The release of the anarchists\r\nthus became a war-cry against the government, and in the autumn of\r\n1885 all my comrades save three were set at liberty by a decree of\r\nPresident Grévy. Then the outcry on behalf of Louise Michel and myself\r\nbecame still louder. However, Alexander III. objected to it; and one\r\nday the prime minister, M. Freycinet, answering an interpellation in\r\nthe Chamber, said that ‘diplomatic difficulties stood in the way of\r\nKropótkin’s release.’ Strange words in the mouth of the prime minister\r\nof an independent country; but still stranger words have been heard\r\nsince in connection with that ill-omened alliance of France with\r\nimperial Russia.\r\n\r\nAt last, in the middle of January 1886, both Louise Michel and Pouget,\r\nas well as the four of us who were still at Clairvaux, were set free.\r\n\r\nWe went to Paris and stayed there for a few weeks with our friend, Elie\r\nReclus--a writer of great power in anthropology, who is often mistaken\r\noutside France for his younger brother, the geographer, Elisée. A close\r\nfriendship has united the two brothers from early youth. When the time\r\ncame for them to enter a university, they went from a small country\r\nplace in the valley of the Gironde to Strasburg, making the journey\r\non foot--accompanied, as true wandering students, by their dog; and\r\nwhen they stayed at some village it was the dog which got his bowl of\r\nsoup, while the two brothers’ supper very often consisted of bread\r\nonly, with a few apples. From Strasburg the younger brother went to\r\nBerlin, whereto he was attracted by the lectures of the great Ritter.\r\nLater on, in the forties, they were both at Paris. Elie Reclus became a\r\nconvinced Fourierist, and both saw in the republic of 1848 the coming\r\nof a new era of social evolution. Consequently, after Napoleon III.’s\r\n_coup d’état_, they both had to leave France, and emigrated to England.\r\nWhen the amnesty was voted, and they returned to Paris, Elie edited\r\nthere a Fourierist co-operative paper which was widely spread among the\r\nworkers. It is not generally known, but may be interesting to note,\r\nthat Napoleon III.--who played the part of a Cæsar, interested, as\r\nbehoves a Cæsar, in the conditions of the working classes--used to send\r\none of his aides-de-camp to the printing office of the paper, each time\r\nit was printed, to take to the Tuileries the first sheet issued from\r\nthe press. He was, later on, even ready to patronize the International\r\nWorkingmen’s Association, on the condition that it should put in one of\r\nits reports a few words of confidence in the great socialist plans of\r\nthe Cæsar; and he ordered its prosecution when the Internationalists\r\nrefused point-blank to do anything of the sort.\r\n\r\nWhen the Commune was proclaimed, both brothers heartily joined it and\r\nElie accepted the post of keeper of the National Library and the Louvre\r\nmuseum under Vaillant. It was, to a great extent, to his foresight\r\nand to his hard work that we owe the preservation of the invaluable\r\ntreasures of human knowledge and art accumulated in these two\r\ninstitutions; otherwise they would have perished during the bombardment\r\nof Paris by the armies of Thiers, and the subsequent conflagration. A\r\npassionate lover of Greek art, and profoundly acquainted with it, he\r\nhad had all the most precious statues and vases of the Louvre packed\r\nand stored in the caves, while the greatest precautions were taken to\r\nprotect the building of the National Library from the conflagration\r\nwhich raged round it. His wife, a courageous, worthy companion of\r\nthe philosopher, followed in the streets by her two little boys,\r\norganized in the meantime in her own quarter of the town the feeding\r\nof the population which had been reduced to sheer destitution by a\r\nsecond siege. During the final few weeks of its existence, the Commune\r\nat last realized that a supply of food to the population, which was\r\ndeprived of the means of earning it for itself, ought to have been the\r\nCommune’s first duty, and volunteers organized the relief. It was by\r\nmere accident that Elie Reclus, who had kept to his post till the last\r\nmoment, escaped being shot by the Versailles troops; and a sentence\r\nof deportation having been pronounced upon him--for having dared to\r\naccept so necessary a service under the Commune--he went with his\r\nfamily into exile. Now, on his return to Paris, he had resumed the\r\nwork of his life--ethnology. What this work is may be judged from a\r\nfew, very few, chapters of it published in book form under the title\r\nof ‘Primitive Folk’ and ‘The Australians,’ as well as from the history\r\nof the origin of religions, which he now lectures upon at the _École\r\ndes Hautes Études_, at Brussels--a foundation of his brother. In the\r\nwhole of the ethnological literature there are not many works imbued\r\nto the same extent with a thorough and sympathetic understanding of the\r\ntrue nature of primitive man. As to his ‘Origin of Religions’ (which is\r\nbeing published in the review, ‘Société Nouvelle,’ and its continuation\r\n‘Humanité Nouvelle’), it is, I venture to say, the best work on the\r\nsubject that has been published--undoubtedly superior to Herbert\r\nSpencer’s attempt in the same direction, because Herbert Spencer, with\r\nall his immense intellect, does not possess that understanding of\r\nthe artless and simple nature of the primitive man which Elie Reclus\r\npossesses to a rare perfection, and to which he has added an extremely\r\nwide knowledge of a rather underrated branch of folk-psychology--the\r\nevolution and transformation of beliefs. It is needless to speak of\r\nElie Reclus’s infinite good nature and modesty, or of his superior\r\nintelligence and vast knowledge of all subjects relating to humanity;\r\nit is all comprehended in his style. With his unbounded modesty, his\r\ncalm manner and his deep philosophical insight, he is the type of the\r\nGreek philosopher of antiquity. In a society less fond of patented\r\ntuition and of piecemeal instruction, and more appreciative of the\r\ndevelopment of wide humanitarian conceptions, he would be surrounded by\r\nflocks of pupils, like one of his Greek prototypes.\r\n\r\nA very animated socialist and anarchist movement was going on at Paris\r\nwhile we stayed there. Louise Michel lectured every night, and aroused\r\nthe enthusiasm of her audiences, whether they consisted of working men\r\nor were made up of middle-class people. Her already great popularity\r\nbecame still greater and spread even amongst the university students,\r\nwho might hate advanced ideas but worshipped in her the ideal woman;\r\nso much so that a riot, caused by someone speaking disrespectfully of\r\nLouise Michel in the presence of students, took place one day in a\r\ncafé. The young people took up her defence and made a fearful uproar,\r\nsmashing all the tables and glasses in the café. I also lectured once\r\non anarchism, before an audience of several thousand people, and left\r\nParis immediately after that lecture, before the government could obey\r\nthe injunctions of the reactionary and the pro-Russian press, which\r\ninsisted upon my being expelled from France.\r\n\r\nFrom Paris we went to London, where I found once more my two old\r\nfriends, Stepniák and Tchaykóvsky. The socialist movement was in full\r\nswing, and life in London was no more the dull, vegetating existence\r\nthat it had been for me four years before.\r\n\r\nWe settled in a small cottage at Harrow. We cared little about the\r\nfurniture of our cottage, a good part of which I made myself with the\r\naid of Tchaykóvsky--he had been in the meantime in the United States\r\nand had learned some carpentering--but we rejoiced immensely at having\r\na small plot of heavy Middlesex clay in our garden. My wife and myself\r\nwent with much enthusiasm into small culture, the admirable results\r\nof which I began to realize after having made acquaintance with the\r\nwritings of Toubeau, and some Paris _maraîchers_ (gardeners), and\r\nafter our own experiment in the prison garden at Clairvaux. As for my\r\nwife, who had typhoid fever soon after we settled at Harrow, the work\r\nin the garden during the period of convalescence was more completely\r\nrestorative for her than a stay at the very best sanatorium.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy the end of the summer a heavy stroke fell upon us. We learned that\r\nmy brother Alexander was no longer alive.\r\n\r\nDuring the years that I had been abroad before my imprisonment in\r\nFrance, we had never corresponded with each other. In the eyes of\r\nthe Russian government, to love a brother who is persecuted for his\r\npolitical opinions is in itself a sin. To maintain relations with\r\nhim after he has become a refugee is a crime. A subject of the Tsar\r\nmust hate all the rebels against the supreme ruler’s authority--and\r\nAlexander was in the clutches of the Russian police. I persistently\r\nrefused therefore to write to him or to any of my relatives. After the\r\nTsar had written on the petition of our sister Hélène, ‘Let him remain\r\nthere,’ there was no hope of a speedy release for my brother. Two years\r\nafter that, a committee was nominated to settle terms for those who\r\nhad been exiled to Siberia without judgment for an undetermined time,\r\nand my brother got five years. That made seven with the two years he\r\nhad already been kept there. Then a new committee was nominated under\r\nLóris Mélikoff, and added another five years. My brother was thus to be\r\nliberated in October 1886. That made twelve years of exile, first in\r\na tiny town of East Siberia, and afterwards at Tomsk--that is in the\r\nlowlands of West Siberia, where he had not even the dry and healthy\r\nclimate of the high prairies farther East.\r\n\r\nWhen I was imprisoned at Clairvaux, he wrote to me, and we exchanged a\r\nfew letters. He wrote that as our letters would be read by the Russian\r\npolice in Siberia and by the French prison authorities in France, we\r\nmight as well write to each other under this double supervision. He\r\nspoke of his family life, of his three children whom he characterized\r\nadmirably well, and of his work. He earnestly advised me to keep a\r\nwatchful eye upon the development of science in Italy, where excellent\r\nand original researches are made, but remain unknown in the scientific\r\nworld until they have been re-manufactured in Germany; and he gave me\r\nhis opinions about the probable march of political life in Russia.\r\nHe did not believe in the possibility with us in a near future, of\r\nconstitutional rule on the pattern of the West European parliaments;\r\nbut he looked forward--and found it quite sufficient for the moment--to\r\nthe convocation of a sort of deliberative National Assembly (_Zémskiy\r\nSobór_ or _Etats Généraux_). It would not vote new laws, but would\r\nonly work out the schemes of laws to which the imperial power and\r\nthe Council of State would give their definitive form and the final\r\nsanction.\r\n\r\nAbove all he wrote to me about his scientific work. He always had a\r\ndecided leaning towards astronomy, and when we were at St. Petersburg\r\nhe had published in Russia an excellent summary of all our knowledge of\r\nthe shooting stars. With his fine critical mind he soon saw the strong\r\nor the weak points of different hypotheses; and without sufficient\r\nknowledge of mathematics, but endowed with a powerful imagination, he\r\nsucceeded in grasping the results of the most intricate mathematical\r\nresearches. Living with his imagination amongst the moving celestial\r\nbodies, he realized their complex movements often better than some\r\nmathematicians--especially the pure algebraists--realize them, because\r\nthey often lose sight of the realities of the physical world to see\r\nonly the formulæ and their logical connections. Our St. Petersburg\r\nastronomers spoke to me with great appreciation of that work of my\r\nbrother. Now he undertook to study the structure of the universe:\r\nto analyze the data and the hypotheses about the worlds of suns,\r\nstar-clusters, and nebulæ in the infinite space, and to disentangle\r\ntheir probable grouping, their life, and the laws of their evolution\r\nand decay. The Púlkova astronomer, Gyldén, spoke highly of this new\r\nwork of Alexander, and introduced him by correspondence to Mr. Holden\r\nin the United States, from whom I had lately the pleasure of hearing,\r\nat Washington, an appreciative estimate of my brother’s researches.\r\nScience is greatly in need, from time to time, of such scientific\r\nspeculations of a higher standard, made by a scrupulously laborious,\r\ncritical, and at the same time, imaginative mind.\r\n\r\nBut in a small town of Siberia, far away from all the libraries, unable\r\nto follow the progress of science, he had only succeeded in embodying\r\nin his work the researches which had been done up to the date of his\r\nexile. Some capital work had been done since--he knew it--but how could\r\nhe get access to the necessary books so long as he remained in Siberia?\r\nThe approach of the term of his liberation did not inspire him with\r\nhope either. He knew that he would not be allowed to stay in any of the\r\nuniversity towns of Russia or of Western Europe, but that his exile to\r\nSiberia would be followed by a second exile, perhaps even worse than\r\nthe first, to some hamlet of Eastern Russia.\r\n\r\nDespair took possession of him. ‘A despair like Faust’s takes hold\r\nof me at times,’ he wrote to me. When the time of his liberation was\r\ncoming, he sent his wife and children to Russia, taking advantage of\r\none of the last steamers before the close of the navigation, and, on a\r\ngloomy night, the despair of Faust put an end to his life....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA dark cloud hung upon our cottage for many months--until a flash of\r\nlight pierced it. It came next Spring, when a tiny being, a girl who\r\nbears my brother’s name, came into the world, and at whose helpless cry\r\nI overheard in my heart quite new chords vibrating.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nIn 1886 the socialist movement in England was in full swing. Large\r\nbodies of workers had openly joined it in all the principal towns, as\r\nwell as a number of middle-class people, chiefly young, who helped it\r\nin different ways. An acute industrial crisis prevailed that year in\r\nmost trades, and every morning, and often all the day long, I heard\r\ngroups of workers going about in the streets singing ‘We’ve got no work\r\nto do,’ or some hymn, and begging for bread. People flocked at night\r\ninto Trafalgar Square to sleep there in the open air, under the wind\r\nand rain, between two newspapers; and one day in February a crowd,\r\nafter having listened to the speeches of Burns, Hyndman, and Champion,\r\nrushed into Piccadilly and broke a few windows in the great shops.\r\nFar more important, however, than this outbreak of discontent, was\r\nthe spirit which prevailed amongst the poorer portion of the working\r\npopulation in the outskirts of London. It was such that if the leaders\r\nof the movement, who were prosecuted for the riots, had received severe\r\nsentences, a spirit of hatred and revenge, hitherto unknown in the\r\nrecent history of the labour movement in England, but the symptoms of\r\nwhich were very well marked in 1886, would have been developed, and\r\nwould have impressed its stamp upon the subsequent movement for a long\r\ntime to come. However, the middle classes seemed to have realized the\r\ndanger. Considerable sums of money were immediately subscribed in the\r\nWest End for the relief of misery in the East End--certainly quite\r\ninadequate to relieve a widely spread destitution, but sufficient to\r\nshow, at least, good intentions. As to the sentences which were passed\r\nupon the prosecuted leaders, they were limited to two and three months’\r\nimprisonment.\r\n\r\nThe amount of interest in socialism and all sorts of schemes of reform\r\nand reconstruction of society was very great in all layers of society.\r\nBeginning with the autumn and throughout the winter, I was asked to\r\nlecture over the country, partly on prisons, but mainly on anarchist\r\nsocialism, and I visited in this way nearly every large town of England\r\nand Scotland. As I had, as a rule, accepted the first invitation I\r\nreceived to stay the night after the lecture, it consequently happened\r\nthat I stayed one night in a rich man’s mansion, and the next night in\r\nthe narrow abode of a working family. Every night I saw considerable\r\nnumbers of people of all classes; and whether it was in the worker’s\r\nsmall parlour, or in the reception-rooms of the wealthy, the most\r\nanimated discussions went on about socialism and anarchism till a late\r\nhour of the night--with hope in the workman’s home, with apprehension\r\nin the mansion, but everywhere with the same earnestness.\r\n\r\nIn the mansions, the main question was to know, ‘What do the socialists\r\nwant? What do they intend to do?’ and next, ‘What are the concessions\r\nwhich it is absolutely necessary to make at some given moment in order\r\nto avoid serious conflicts?’ In these conversations I seldom heard the\r\njustice of the socialist contention merely denied, or described as\r\nsheer nonsense. But I found also a firm conviction that a revolution\r\nwas impossible in England; that the claims of the mass of the workers\r\nhad not yet reached the precision nor the extent of the claims of the\r\nsocialists, and that the workers would be satisfied with much less;\r\nso that secondary concessions, amounting to a prospect of a slight\r\nincrease of well-being or of leisure, would be accepted by the working\r\nclasses of England as a pledge in the meantime of still more in the\r\nfuture. ‘We are a left-centre country, we live by compromises,’ I was\r\nonce told by an old member of Parliament, who had had a wide experience\r\nof the life of his mother country.\r\n\r\nIn workmen’s dwellings too, I noticed a difference in the questions\r\nwhich were addressed to me in England to those which I was asked on\r\nthe Continent. General principles, of which the partial applications\r\nwill be determined by the principles themselves, deeply interest\r\nthe Latin workers. If this or that municipal council votes funds in\r\nsupport of a strike, or organizes the feeding of the children at the\r\nschools, no importance is attached to such steps. They are taken as\r\na matter of fact. ‘Of course, a hungry child cannot learn,’ a French\r\nworker says. ‘It must be fed.’ ‘Of course, the employer was wrong\r\nin forcing the workers to strike.’ This is all that is said, and no\r\npraise is given on account of such minor concessions by the present\r\nindividualist society to communist principles. The thought of the\r\nworker goes beyond the period of such concessions, and he asks whether\r\nit is the Commune, or the unions of workers, or the State which ought\r\nto undertake the organization of production; whether free agreement\r\nalone will be sufficient to maintain Society in working order, and\r\nwhat would be the moral restraint if Society parted with its present\r\nrepressive agencies; whether an elected democratic government would be\r\ncapable of accomplishing serious changes in the socialist direction,\r\nand whether accomplished facts ought not to precede legislation? and\r\nso on. In England, it was upon a series of palliative concessions,\r\ngradually growing in importance, that the chief weight was laid.\r\nBut, on the other hand, the impossibility of state administration of\r\nindustries seemed to have been settled long ago in the workers’ minds,\r\nand what chiefly interested most of them were matters of constructive\r\nrealization, as well as how to attain the conditions which would make\r\nsuch a realization possible. ‘Well, Kropótkin, suppose that to-morrow\r\nwe were to take possession of the docks of our town. What’s your idea\r\nabout how to manage them?’ I would, for instance, be asked as soon as\r\nwe had sat down in a small workman’s parlour. Or, ‘We don’t like the\r\nidea of state management of railways, and the present management by\r\nprivate companies is organized robbery. But suppose the workers owned\r\nall the railways. How could the working of them be organized?’ The lack\r\nof general ideas was thus supplemented by a desire of going deeper into\r\nthe details of the realities.\r\n\r\nAnother feature of the movement in England was the considerable number\r\nof middle-class people who gave it their support in different ways,\r\nsome of them frankly joining it, while others helped it from the\r\noutside. In France or in Switzerland, the two parties--the workers and\r\nthe middle classes--not only stood arrayed against each other, but were\r\nsharply separated. So it was, at least, in the years 1876-85. When I\r\nwas in Switzerland I could say that during my three or four years’ stay\r\nin the country I was acquainted with none but workers--I hardly knew\r\nmore than a couple of middle-class men. In England this would have been\r\nimpossible. We found quite a number of middle-class men and women who\r\ndid not hesitate to appear openly, both in London and in the provinces,\r\nas helpers in organizing socialist meetings, or in going about during\r\na strike with boxes to collect coppers in the parks. Besides, we saw a\r\nmovement, similar to what we had had in Russia in the early seventies,\r\nwhen our youth rushed ‘to the people,’ though by no means so intense,\r\nso full of self-sacrifice, and so utterly devoid of the idea of\r\n‘charity.’ Here also, in England, a number of people went in all sorts\r\nof capacities to live near to the workers: in the slums, in people’s\r\npalaces, in Toynbee Hall, and the like. It must be said that there was\r\na great deal of enthusiasm at that time. Many probably thought that\r\na social revolution had commenced, like the hero of Morris’s comical\r\nplay, ‘Tables Turned,’ who says that the revolution is not simply\r\ncoming, but has already begun. As always happens however with such\r\nenthusiasts, when they saw that in England, as everywhere, there was a\r\nlong, tedious, preparatory, uphill work that had to be done, very many\r\nof them retired from active propaganda, and now stand outside of it as\r\nmere sympathetic onlookers.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nI took a lively part in this movement, and with a few English comrades\r\nwe started, in addition to the three socialist papers already in\r\nexistence, an anarchist-communist monthly, ‘Freedom,’ which continues\r\nto live up to the present day. At the same time I resumed my work on\r\nanarchism where I had had to interrupt it at the moment of my arrest.\r\nThe critical part of it was published during my Clairvaux imprisonment\r\nby Elisée Reclus, under the title of ‘Paroles d’un Révolté.’ Now I\r\nbegan to work out the constructive part of an anarchist-communist\r\nsociety--so far as it can now be forecast--in a series of articles\r\npublished at Paris in ‘La Révolté.’ Our ‘boy,’ ‘Le Révolté,’ prosecuted\r\nfor anti-militarist propaganda, was compelled to change its title-page\r\nand now appeared under a feminine name. Later on these articles were\r\npublished in a more elaborate form in a book, ‘La Conquête du Pain.’\r\n\r\nThese researches caused me to study more thoroughly certain points of\r\nthe economic life of our present civilized nations. Most socialists\r\nhad hitherto said that in our present civilized societies we actually\r\nproduce much more than is necessary for guaranteeing full well-being\r\nto all. It is only the distribution which is defective; and if a\r\nsocial revolution took place, nothing more would be required than\r\nfor everyone to return to his factory or workshop, Society taking\r\npossession for itself of the ‘surplus value’ or benefits which now\r\ngo to the capitalist. I thought, on the contrary, that under the\r\npresent conditions of private ownership production itself had taken\r\na wrong turn, so as to neglect, and often to prevent, the production\r\nof the very necessaries for life on a sufficient scale. None of these\r\nare produced in greater quantities than would be required to secure\r\nwell-being for all; and the over-production, so often spoken of, means\r\nnothing but that the masses are too poor to buy even what is now\r\nconsidered as necessary for a decent existence. But in all civilized\r\ncountries the production, both agricultural and industrial, ought\r\nto and easily might be immensely increased so as to secure a reign\r\nof plenty for all. This brought me to consider the possibilities of\r\nmodern agriculture, as well as those of an education which would give\r\nto everyone the possibility of carrying on at the same time both\r\nenjoyable manual work and brain work. I developed these ideas in a\r\nseries of articles in the ‘Nineteenth Century,’ which are now published\r\nas a book under the title of ‘Fields, Factories, and Workshops.’\r\n\r\nAnother great question also engrossed my attention. It is known to what\r\nconclusions Darwin’s formula, ‘The Struggle for Existence,’ had been\r\ndeveloped by most of his followers, even the most intelligent of them,\r\nsuch as Huxley. There is no infamy in civilized society, or in the\r\nrelations of the whites towards the so-called lower races, or of the\r\n‘strong’ towards the ‘weak,’ which would not have found its excuse in\r\nthis formula.\r\n\r\nAlready during my stay at Clairvaux I saw the necessity of completely\r\nrevising the formula itself of ‘struggle for existence’ in the animal\r\nworld, and its applications to human affairs. The attempts which had\r\nbeen made by a few socialists in this direction had not satisfied\r\nme, when I found in a lecture of a Russian zoologist, Prof. Kessler,\r\na true expression of the law of struggle for life. ‘Mutual aid,’ he\r\nsaid in that lecture, ‘is as much a law of nature as mutual struggle;\r\nbut for the _progressive_ evolution of the species the former is\r\nfar more important than the latter.’ These few words--confirmed\r\nunfortunately by only a couple of illustrations (to which Syévertsoff,\r\nthe zoologist of whom I have spoken in an earlier chapter, added one or\r\ntwo more)--contained for me the key of the whole problem. When Huxley\r\npublished in 1888 his atrocious article, ‘The Struggle for Existence:\r\na Program,’ I decided to put in a readable form my objections to his\r\nway of understanding the struggle for life, among animals as well as\r\namong men, the materials for which I had accumulated during a couple\r\nof years. I spoke of it to my friends. However, I found that the\r\ncomprehension of ‘struggle for life’ in the sense of a war-cry of\r\n‘Woe to the weak,’ raised to the height of a commandment of nature\r\nrevealed by science, was so deeply inrooted in this country that it\r\nhad become almost a matter of religion. Two persons only supported me\r\nin my revolt against this misinterpretation of the facts of nature.\r\nThe editor of the ‘Nineteenth Century,’ Mr. James Knowles, with his\r\nadmirable perspicacity, at once seized the gist of the matter, and with\r\na truly youthful energy encouraged me to take it in hand. The other\r\nwas H. W. Bates, whom Darwin has truly described in his autobiography\r\nas one of the most intelligent men whom he ever met. He was secretary\r\nof the Geographical Society, and I knew him. When I spoke to him of my\r\nintention he was delighted with it. ‘Yes, most assuredly write it,’ he\r\nsaid. ‘That is true Darwinism. It is a shame to think of what “they”\r\nhave made of Darwin’s ideas. Write it, and when you have published\r\nit, I will write you a letter in that sense which you may publish.’ I\r\ncould not have had better encouragement, and began the work which was\r\npublished in the ‘Nineteenth Century’ under the titles of ‘Mutual Aid\r\namong Animals,’ ‘among Savages,’ ‘among Barbarians,’ ‘in the Mediæval\r\nCity,’ and ‘among Ourselves.’ Unfortunately I neglected to submit to\r\nBates the first two articles of this series, dealing with animals,\r\nwhich were published during his lifetime; I hoped to be soon ready with\r\nthe second part of the work, ‘Mutual Aid among Men,’ but it took me\r\nseveral years before I completed it, and in the meantime Bates was no\r\nmore among us.\r\n\r\nThe researches which I had to make during these studies in order to\r\nacquaint myself with the institutions of the barbarian period and\r\nwith those of the mediæval free cities, led me to another important\r\nresearch--the part played in history by the state, since its last\r\nincarnation in Europe, during the last three centuries. And on the\r\nother side, the study of the mutual-support institutions at different\r\nstages of civilization, led me to examine the evolutionist bases of the\r\nsense of justice and of morality in man.\r\n\r\nWithin the last ten years the growth of socialism in England has taken\r\na new aspect. Those who judge only by the numbers of socialist and\r\nanarchist meetings held in the country, and the audiences attracted by\r\nthese meetings, are prone to conclude that socialist propaganda is now\r\non the decline. And those who judge the progress of it by the numbers\r\nof votes that are given to those who claim to represent socialism\r\nin Parliament, jump to the conclusion that there is now hardly any\r\nsocialist propaganda in England. But the depth and the penetration\r\nof the socialist ideas can nowhere be judged by the numbers of votes\r\ngiven in favour of those who bring more or less socialism into their\r\nelectoral programmes. Still less so in England. The fact is, that out\r\nof the three directions of socialism which were formulated by Fourier,\r\nSaint Simon, and Robert Owen, it is the latter which prevails in\r\nEngland and Scotland. Consequently it is not so much by the numbers of\r\nmeetings or socialist votes that the intensity of the movement must be\r\njudged, but by the infiltration of the socialist point of view into the\r\ntrade unionist, the co-operative, and the so-called municipal socialist\r\nmovements, as well as the general infiltration of socialist ideas all\r\nover the country. Under this aspect, the extent to which the socialist\r\nviews have penetrated is vast in comparison to what it was in 1886; and\r\nI do not hesitate to say that it is simply immense in comparison to\r\nwhat it was in the years 1876-82. I may also add that the persevering\r\nendeavours of the tiny anarchist groups have contributed, to an extent\r\nwhich makes us feel that we have not wasted our time, to spread the\r\nideas of No-Government, of the rights of the individual, of local\r\naction, and free agreement--as against those of State all-mightiness,\r\ncentralization, and discipline, which were dominant twenty years ago.\r\n\r\nEurope altogether is traversing now a very bad phase of the development\r\nof the military spirit. This was an unavoidable consequence of the\r\nvictory obtained by the German military empire, with its universal\r\nmilitary service system, over France in 1871, and it was already then\r\nforeseen and foretold by many--in an especially impressive form by\r\nBakúnin. But the counter-current already begins to make itself felt in\r\nmodern life.\r\n\r\nAs to the way communist ideas, divested of their monastic form, have\r\npenetrated in Europe and America, the extent of that penetration has\r\nbeen immense during the twenty-seven years that I have taken an active\r\npart in the socialist movement and could observe their growth. When\r\nI think of the vague, confused, timid ideas which were expressed by\r\nthe workers at the first congresses of the International Workingmen’s\r\nAssociation, or which were current at Paris during the Commune\r\ninsurrection, even amongst the most thoughtful of the leaders, and\r\ncompare them with those which have been arrived at to-day by an immense\r\nnumber of working-men, I must say they seem to me as two entirely\r\ndifferent worlds.\r\n\r\nThere is no period in history--with the exception, perhaps, of the\r\nperiod of the insurrections in the twelfth and the thirteenth centuries\r\n(which led to the birth of the mediæval Communes), during which a\r\nsimilarly deep change has taken place in the current conceptions of\r\nSociety. And now, in my fifty-seventh year, I am even more deeply\r\nconvinced than I was twenty-five years ago, that a chance combination\r\nof accidental circumstances may bring about in Europe a revolution far\r\nmore important and as widely spread as that of 1848; not in the sense\r\nof mere fighting between different parties, but in the sense of a deep\r\nand rapid social reconstruction; and I am convinced that whatever\r\ncharacter such movements may take in different countries, there will\r\nbe displayed in all of them a far deeper comprehension of the required\r\nchanges than has ever been displayed within the last six centuries;\r\nwhile the resistance which such movements will meet in the privileged\r\nclasses will hardly have the character of obtuse obstinacy which made\r\nrevolutions assume the violent character which they took in times past.\r\n\r\nTo obtain this immense result was well worth the efforts which so many\r\nthousands of men and women of all nations and all classes have made\r\nwithin the last thirty years.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE ABERDEEN UNIVERSITY PRESS LIMITED\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n\r\nItalicized text is surrounded by underscores: _italics_.\r\n\r\nSmall capitals are changed to all capitals.\r\n\r\nNew original cover art included with this eBook is granted to the\r\npublic domain.\r\n\r\nObvious typographical errors and punctuation errors have been corrected\r\nafter careful comparison with other occurrences within the text and\r\nconsultation of external sources.
