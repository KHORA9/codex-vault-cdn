McDONNELL\r\n\r\nWith a Preface by John Redmond, M.P.\r\n\r\n1908\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Matri dilectissimae_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nWithout agreeing with every expression of opinion contained in the\r\nfollowing pages I heartily recommend this book, especially to Englishmen\r\nand Scotchmen, as a thoughtful, well-informed, and scholarly study of\r\nseveral of the more important features of the Irish question.\r\n\r\nIt has always been my conviction that one of the chief causes of the\r\ndifficulty of persuading the British people of the justice and\r\nexpediency of conceding a full measure of National autonomy to Ireland\r\nwas to be found in the deep and almost universal ignorance in Great\r\nBritain regarding Irish affairs present and past--an ignorance which has\r\nenabled every unscrupulous opponent of Irish demands to appeal with more\r\nor less success to inherited and anti-Irish prejudice as his chief\r\nbulwark against reform. It was this conviction that led Mr. Parnell and\r\nhis leading colleagues, after the defeat of the first Home Rule Bill in\r\n1886, to establish an agency in England for the express purpose of\r\nremoving the ignorance and combating its effects, and no advocate of\r\nIrish claims in England or Scotland has failed to find traces down to\r\nthis day of the good effects of the propaganda thus set on foot, the\r\ndiscontinuance of which was one of the lamentable results of the\r\ndissensions in the Irish National Party between 1890 and 1900.\r\n\r\nThis book carries on the work of combating British ignorance of Irish\r\naffairs and the effects of that ignorance in a manner which seems to me\r\nsingularly effective. The writer is no mere rhetorician or dealer in\r\ngeneralities. On the contrary, he deals in particular facts and gives\r\nhis authorities. Nothing is more striking than the care he has\r\nobviously taken to ascertain the details of the subjects with which he\r\nhas concerned himself and the inexorable logic of his method. It is\r\nperfectly safe to say that he neglected few sources of information which\r\npromised any valuable results, and that he has condensed into a few\r\npages the more vital points of many volumes. It is not necessary to say\r\nanything of his style except that the cultured reader will most\r\nappreciate and enjoy it.\r\n\r\nI shall not anticipate what the author has to say except in respect of\r\none particular matter to which it seems to me expedient that particular\r\npublic attention should be directed, especially by English and Scotch\r\nreaders. The study of Irish history throws an inglorious light on the\r\ncharacter of many British statesmen, and one of the salient facts\r\nbrought into prominence in this little volume is that, even since the\r\nconversion of Mr. Gladstone to Home Rule, more than one leader of each\r\nof the two great political parties in Great Britain have displayed an\r\nutter lack of political principle in their dealings with Ireland, and\r\nespecially with the Irish National question. I cannot but think that if\r\nthe facts, as told by the author of this volume, were universally, or\r\neven widely, known amongst Englishmen and Scotchmen there would be much\r\nless heard in the future regarding Home Rule eventuating in Rome Rule or\r\nendangering the existence of the Empire.\r\n\r\nThis volume will, I hope, have a wide circulation not only in Great\r\nBritain, where such works are specially needed but in Ireland itself,\r\nwhere also it is well calculated to strengthen the faith of convinced\r\nHome Rulers and to bring light to the few who are still opposed to the\r\nIrish National demand for self-government, and to other important,\r\nthough minor, reforms.\r\n\r\nJ.

Three years ago I stood\r\nin the crypt of St. Peter's in Rome, and the Englishman who was with me\r\nexpatiated on the appropriate nature of the massive sarcophagus of red\r\ngranite, adorned only with a carved bull's head at each of the four\r\ncorners, which seemed to him to stand as a type of British might and\r\nBritish simplicity, and in which the sacristan had told us lay all that\r\nwas mortal of Nicholas Breakspeare. Seeing that I took no part in this\r\npanegyric, he took me on one side and said that he had observed that all\r\nthe English Protestants to whom he showed that tomb, situated as it is\r\nliterally _ad limina Apostolorum_, waxed eloquent, but, on the other\r\nhand, the Irish Catholics whom he told that it contained the bones of\r\nthe dead Pontiff invariably shook their fists at the ashes of the\r\nunwitting, but none the less actual, source of their country's ills. To\r\nthis I replied by quoting to him a saying of Robert Louis Stevenson, who\r\nas a Scot viewed the matter impartially, and who declared \"that the\r\nIrishman should not love the Englishman is not disgraceful, rather,\r\nindeed, honourable, since it depends on wrongs ancient like the race and\r\nnot personal to him who cherishes the indignation.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe great tendency which has been so marked a feature of Irish life in\r\nthe course of the last decade to turn the attention of the people\r\ntowards efforts at self-improvement and the development of self-reliance\r\nwithout regard to English aid, English neglect, or English opinion,\r\nexcellent though it has been in every other respect, has had this one\r\ndrawback--that there has grown up a generation of Englishmen,\r\nwell-intentioned towards our country, to whom the problems of Irish\r\nGovernment are an unknown quantity. The ignorance of Irish affairs in\r\nEngland is due partly to ourselves, but also to a natural heedlessness\r\narising from distance and preoccupation with problems with which\r\nEnglishmen are more intimately concerned.\r\n\r\nIn view of the awakening of the democratic forces of Great Britain it is\r\nvital that Irish questions should be set before the eyes of the\r\nelectorate of Great Britain, in order that, when for the first time the\r\nconstitutional questions involved are placed before voters unprejudiced\r\nby class interests or a fellow-feeling for the pretensions of property\r\nwherever situate, there may be a body of electors who realise the\r\ngravity of the problems in question, and who have a full appreciation of\r\nthe history of the case.\r\n\r\nThe Irish question has at no time been brought before the English public\r\nless than at the present day. Fenianism in the seventies and the various\r\nagrarian agitations in the eighties served to keep it constantly before\r\nthe English eyes, and after the acquittal of Mr. Parnell and his\r\ncolleagues of the charges brought against them by the _Times_ much\r\neducative work was done for a short time by Irish Members of Parliament\r\non English platforms.\r\n\r\nThe demands of Ireland have always been met by an unjust dilemma. When\r\nshe has been disturbed the reply has been that till quiet is restored\r\nnothing can be done, and when a peaceful Ireland has demanded\r\nlegislation the absence of agitation has been adduced as a reason for\r\nthe retort that the request is not widespread, and can, in consequence,\r\nbe ignored.\r\n\r\nThe remedy against such inaction proving successful in the future lies\r\nin the existence of a strong body of public opinion in Great Britain,\r\neducated to such a degree in the facts of the case as to brook no delay\r\nin the application of remedies. As for us, we cannot expect to be\r\nbelieved on our mere _ipse dixit_, and must state our case frankly and\r\nfully. The present moment seems timely, before the smoke of conflict has\r\nonce again obscured the broad principles at issue. I propose to deal\r\nwith reform in a plea of urgency, endeavouring at the same time to trace\r\nthe evolution of things as they are to-day, quoting history as I go,\r\nwith one aim only in view, to point a moral and adorn a tale. It will\r\nserve, I hope, to explain the past, to illustrate the present and to\r\nprovide a warning for the future.\r\n\r\nThe Irish question, as Lord Rosebery has said, has never passed into\r\nhistory, because it has never passed out of politics.\r\n\r\nM.F.J. McD.\r\n\r\nGoldsmith Building, Temple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE EXECUTIVE IN IRELAND\r\n\r\n     \"La 'Garnison' a occupée le pays sans le 'gouverner,' ou en ne\r\n     le gouvernant que de son propre interet de classe: son\r\n     hegemonie a été toute sa politique.\"\r\n\r\n     --L. PAUL-DUBOIS, _L'Irlande Contemporaine_, 1907.\r\n\r\n     \"A regarder de près on percoit pourtant que cette imitation\r\n     Irlandaise de la justice brittanique n'en est sur bien des\r\n     points qu'une assez grossiere caricature, ce qui prouve une\r\n     fois de plus que les meilleures institutions ne vaient que ce\r\n     que valent les hommes qui les appliquent, et que les lois sent\r\n     pen de choses quand elles ne sont pas soutenus par les\r\n     moeurs.\"--Ibid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What does Ireland want now; what would she have more?\" asked Pitt of\r\nGrattan at the dinner table of the Duke of Portland in 1794, and\r\nEnglishmen have echoed and re-echoed the question throughout the century\r\nwhich has elapsed. The mode in which it is asked reminds me, I must\r\nconfess, of that first sentence in Bacon's Essays--\"What is truth? said\r\njesting Pilate, and would not wait for an answer.\"\r\n\r\nWhen, at the end of the nineteenth century, the nations of Europe\r\ndevoted themselves to a retrospective study of the progress which the\r\npassing of a hundred years had brought in its train, Ireland alone was\r\nunable to join in the chorus of self-congratulation which arose on every\r\nside.\r\n\r\nTo her it was the centenary of the great betrayal to which, as a\r\ndistinguished writer has said, the whole of her unbribed intellect was\r\nopposed, and which formed the climax to a century of suffering. The\r\nancients who held that when ill-fortune befell their country the gods\r\nmust be asleep would have said so, I have no doubt, of Ireland at the\r\nend of the eighteenth century. The people, in a phrase which has become\r\nhistoric, had put their money on the wrong horse in their devotion to\r\nthe Stuart cause, but, more than this, while they thereby earned the\r\ndetestation of the Whigs, they were not compensated for it by the\r\nsympathy of the Tories, who feared their Catholicism even more than they\r\nliked their Jacobitism. In this way the country fell between two stools,\r\nand was not governed, even as English Statesmen professed to govern it,\r\nas a dependency, but rather it was exploited in the interest of the\r\nruling caste with an eye to the commercial interests of Great Britain in\r\nso far as its competition was injurious. Religious persecution, aiming\r\nfrankly at proselytism, and restrictions imposed so as to choke every\r\nindustry which in any way hit English manufactures were the keynotes of\r\nthe whole policy, and in the pages of Edmund Burke one may find a more\r\nsearching indictment of English rule in Ireland in the eighteenth\r\ncentury than any which has since been drawn up.\r\n\r\nThe concession of Parliamentary independence in 1782 was, as the whole\r\nworld knows, yielded as a counsel of prudence in the panic fright\r\nresulting from the American war and the French revolution. Under\r\nGrattan's Parliament the country began to enjoy a degree of prosperity\r\nsuch as she had never known before, and the destruction of that\r\nParliament was effected, as Castlereagh, the Chief Secretary, himself\r\nexpressed it, by \"buying up the fee-simple of Irish corruption\"; in\r\nother words, by the creation of twenty-six peerages and the expenditure\r\nof one and a half million in bribing borough-mongers.\r\n\r\nIn very truth, the Act of Union was one which, by uniting the\r\nlegislatures, divided the peoples; and it has been pointed out as\r\nsignificant that when the legislatures of England and Scotland were\r\namalgamated a common name was found for the whole island, but that no\r\nsuch name has been adopted for the three kingdoms which were united in\r\n1800.\r\n\r\nThe new epoch began in such a way as might have been expected from its\r\nconception. The bigotry of George III., undismayed by what he used to\r\ncall Pitt's \"damned long obstinate face,\" delayed for more than a\r\nquarter of a century the grant of Emancipation to the Catholics, by\r\npromises of which a certain amount of their hostility had been disarmed.\r\nThe tenantry asked in vain for nearly three-quarters of the century for\r\nsome alleviation of the land system under which they groaned, and for an\r\nequal length of time three-quarters of the population were forced to\r\nendure the tyranny of being bound to support a Church to which they did\r\nnot belong. The cause of struggling nationality on the Continent of\r\nEurope, in Italy, in Hungary, in Poland, in the Slav provinces, has in\r\neach case gained sympathy in Great Britain, but the cause of Irish\r\nnationality has received far other treatment. That charity should begin\r\nat home may be a counsel of perfection, but in point of fact one rarely\r\nsees it applied. Sympathy for the poor relation at one's door is a rare\r\nthing indeed. Increasing prosperity makes nations, as it makes men, more\r\nintolerant of growing adversity, and the poor man is apt to get more\r\nkicks than half-pence from the rich kinsmen under the shadow of whose\r\npalace he spends his life, and to whom his poverty, his relationship,\r\nand his dependence are a standing reproach. When I hear surprise\r\nexpressed by Englishmen at the fact that England is not loved in Ireland\r\nI wonder at the deep-seated ignorance of the mutual feelings which have\r\nso long subsisted, one side of which one may find expressed in the\r\nliterature of England, from Shakespeare's references to the \"rough,\r\nuncivil kernes of Ireland\" down to the contemptuous sneers of Charles\r\nKingsley, that most English of all writers in the language, each of whom\r\nprovides, as I think, a sure index to the feelings of his contemporaries\r\nand serves to illustrate the inveterate sentiment of hostility,\r\nflavoured with contempt, which, as Mr. Gladstone once said, has from\r\ntime immemorial formed the basis of English tradition, and in regard to\r\nwhich the _locus classicus_ was the statement of his great opponent,\r\nLord Salisbury, that as to Home Rule the Irish were not fit for it, for,\r\nhe went on to say, \"nations like the Hottentots, and even the Hindoos,\r\nare incapable of self-government.\"\r\n\r\nA cynical Irish Secretary once asked whether the Irish people blamed the\r\nGovernment for the weather; but it must be conceded that the mode of\r\ngovernment made the Irish people more dependent than otherwise they\r\nwould have been on climatic conditions, for this reason, that the margin\r\nbetween their means and a starvation wage was extremely small, and thus\r\nit was that in the middle of the century an act of God brought\r\nsufferings in its train, the results of which have not yet been effaced.\r\nThrough it all the country was governed not in the interests of the\r\nmajority, but according to the fiat of a small minority kept in power by\r\narmed force, not by the use of the common law, but of a specially\r\nenacted coercive code applicable to the whole or any part of the country\r\nat the mere caprice of the chief of the Executive. The record, it must\r\nbe admitted, is not edifying. Irish history, one may well say, is not of\r\nsuch a nature as to put one \"on the side of the angels.\" Lecky's\r\n\"History of the Eighteenth Century\" has made many converts to Home Rule,\r\nand I venture to think that when another Lecky comes to write of the\r\nhistory of the nineteenth century the converts which he will make will\r\nbe even more numerous.\r\n\r\nAmong the anomalies of Irish government there is none greater than that\r\nof the Executive, the head of which is the Viceroy. The position of\r\nthis official is very different from that of the governor of a\r\nself-governing colony. If the Viceroy is in the Cabinet his Chief\r\nSecretary is not; but the more common practice of recent years has been\r\nfor the Chief Secretary to have a seat in the Cabinet to the exclusion\r\nof the Lord Lieutenant. Whether the latter be in the Cabinet or not he\r\nhas no ministers as has a colonial governor, to whose advice he must\r\nlisten because they possess the confidence of a representative body, and\r\nmoreover, although the Lord Lieutenant is a Minister of the Crown, his\r\nsalary is charged on the Consolidated Fund, with the result that his\r\nacts do not come before the House of Commons on Committee of Supply as\r\ndo those of the Chief Secretary on the occasion of the annual vote for\r\nhis salary.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1823 Joseph Hume ventilated the question of the abolition of\r\nthe Lord Lieutenancy, and a motion introduced by him to that effect in\r\n1830 received a considerable measure of support. Lord Clarendon, who in\r\n1847 succeeded Lord Bessborough as Viceroy, accepted the office on the\r\nexpress condition that the Government should take the first opportunity\r\nof removing the anomaly. In pursuance of this agreement Lord John\r\nRussell, in 1850, introduced a Bill, which was supported by Peel, with\r\nthe abolition of the office for its object. On its second reading it was\r\npassed by the House of Commons by 295 votes to 70. In spite of this\r\nenormous majority in its favour the Bill was dropped in an unprecedented\r\nmanner, and never reached the Committee stage owing, it is said, to the\r\nopposition of Wellington, who objected to the fact that it would deprive\r\nthe Crown of its direct control over the forces in Ireland and to the\r\nfact that it would leave the Lord Mayor of Dublin, a person who was\r\nelected by a more or less popular vote, as the chief authority in that\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nIn 1857 the question was mooted once more, but no action ensued; and\r\nagain, on the resignation of Lord Londonderry in 1889, a number of Irish\r\nUnionists, headed by the Marquis of Waterford, urged Lord Salisbury to\r\nconsider the advisability of abolishing the office, together with the\r\nViceregal Court, which a recent French observer has stigmatised as\r\n\"peuplé de snobs, de parasites et de parvenus.\"[1] In the event Lord\r\nSalisbury, so far from acceding to the request, nominated the Marquis of\r\nZetland to the vacant post, and the proposal to abolish it has not since\r\nbeen raised in public. Men like Archbishop Whately, in the middle of the\r\nnineteenth century, whose ambition it was to see what they called the\r\nconsolidation of Great Britain and Ireland effected, were strongly in\r\nfavour of the proposal, and its rejection on so many occasions has been\r\ndoubtless due to the fact that to mix and confound the administration of\r\nIreland with that of Great Britain would necessitate the abandonment of\r\nthe extreme centralisation of Irish Government, and those who were most\r\nanxious, as the phrase went, to make Cork like York were the very people\r\nwho were most opposed to any abdication of Executive powers which an\r\nassimilation of methods of government would have inevitably brought in\r\nits train.\r\n\r\nThe government of Ireland is effected by more than forty boards--the\r\nforty thieves the late Mr. Davitt used to call them--and it will be for\r\nthe reader, after he has studied the account which I propose to give of\r\nthem, to say whether or not they deserve the name.\r\n\r\nIt is nearly twenty years since Mr. Chamberlain, in a celebrated speech\r\nat Islington, made the following remarkable declaration:--\"I say the\r\ntime has come to reform altogether the absurd and irritating anachronism\r\nwhich is known as Dublin Castle, to sweep away altogether the alien\r\nboards of foreign officials and to substitute for them a genuine Irish\r\nadministration for purely Irish business.\" Change of opinions, no one\r\ncan refuse to admit, in a statesman any more than in other men, and as\r\nregards the latter part of the extract which I have quoted Mr.\r\nChamberlain may have changed his views, but it is to the earlier part of\r\nthe sentence that I would refer. There is in it a definite statement of\r\nfacts which no change in opinion on the part of the speaker could alter,\r\nand which express, as well as they can be expressed, the views of the\r\nNationalists as to the Castle, the alien boards of foreign officials in\r\nwhich remained undisturbed during the course of the seven years after\r\nthe coalition of Unionists and Tories, in which Mr. Chamberlain was the\r\nmost powerful Minister of the Crown.\r\n\r\nOf the purely domestic branches of the Civil Service in Great Britain,\r\nthe Treasury, the Home Office, the Boards of Education, of Trade, and of\r\nAgriculture, the Post Office, the Local Government Board, and the Office\r\nof Works, are all responsible to the public directly, through\r\nrepresentative Ministers with seats in the House of Commons, the\r\nliability of whom to be examined by private members as to minutiæ of\r\ntheir departmental policy is one of the most valuable checks against\r\nofficial incompetence or scandals, and is the only protection under the\r\nconstitution against arbitrary rule. The whole administrative machinery\r\nof the forty-three boards in Ireland has been represented in Parliament\r\nby one member, the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant, but he is\r\nsupported since a few months ago by the Vice-president of the Department\r\nof Agriculture. The result is that, while in Great Britain a watchful\r\neye can be kept on extravagance or mismanagement of the public services,\r\nthe maintenance of a diametrically opposite system of government in\r\nIreland, under which it is impossible to let in the same amount of\r\nlight, leads to the bureaucratic conditions of which Mr. Chamberlain\r\nspoke in the speech from which I have quoted.\r\n\r\nIn answer to these complaints it is usual to point to the case of\r\nScotland as analogous, and to ask why Ireland should complain when the\r\nScottish form of government arouses no resentment in that country. The\r\nparallel in no sense holds good, for Scotland has not a separate\r\nExecutive as has Ireland, although she has, like Ireland, a separate\r\nSecretary in the House of Commons. Scottish legislation generally\r\nfollows that of England and Wales, and in any case Scotland has not\r\npassed through a period of travail as has Ireland, nor have exceptional\r\nremedies at recurring periods in her history been demanded by the social\r\nconditions of the country; and last, but by no means least, one has only\r\nto look at a list of Ministers of the Crown in the case of this\r\nGovernment, or of that which preceded it, to see that the interests of\r\nScotland are well represented by the occupants of the Treasury Bench,\r\nwhichever party is in power, so that it is no matter for surprise that\r\nshe is precluded by her long acquiescence from demanding constitutional\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nMore than half a century ago Lord John Russell promised O'Connell to\r\nsubstitute County Boards for the Grand Jury, in its capacity of Local\r\nAuthority, but the latter survived until ten years ago. The members of\r\nthe Grand Jury were nominated by the High Sheriffs of the Counties, and\r\nas was natural, seeing that they were the nominees of a great landlord,\r\nthey were almost entirely composed of landlords, and the score of\r\ngentlemen who served on these bodies in many instances imposed taxation,\r\nas is now freely admitted, for the benefit of their own property on a\r\nrack-rented tenantry. A reform of this system of local government was\r\npromised by the Liberals in the Queen's Speech of 1881, but so far was\r\nthe powerful Government at that time in office from fulfilling its\r\npledges that not only was no Bill to that effect introduced, but,\r\nfurther, in April, 1883, a Bill to establish elective County Councils,\r\nwhich was introduced by the Irish Party, was thrown out in the House of\r\nCommons by 231 votes to 58. In his famous speech at Newport in 1885,\r\nwhen the Tories were, as all the world thought, coquetting with Home\r\nRule, Lord Salisbury declared that of the two, popular local government\r\nwould be even more dangerous than Home Rule. He based his view partly on\r\nthe difficulty of finding thirty or forty suitable persons in each of\r\nthe thirty-two counties to sit on local bodies, which would be greater\r\nthan that of finding three or four suitable M.P.s for the same divisions\r\nof the country; but, even more than this, he insisted on the fact that a\r\nlocal body has more opportunity for inflicting injustice on minorities\r\nthan has an authority deriving its sanction and extending its\r\njurisdiction over a wider area, where, as he declared, \"the wisdom of\r\nthe several parts of the country will correct the folly or mistakes of\r\none.\" In spite of this explicit declaration, when, in the following\r\nyear, the Tories had definitely ranged themselves on the side of\r\nUnionism, the alternative policy to the proposals of Mr. Gladstone was\r\nnothing less than the establishment of a system of popular local\r\ngovernment. Speaking with all the premeditation which a full sense of\r\nthe importance of the occasion must have demanded, Lord Randolph\r\nChurchill, on a motion for an Address in reply to the Queen's Speech\r\nafter the general election of 1886 had resulted in a Unionist victory,\r\nmade use of these words in his capacity of leader in the House of\r\nCommons:--\r\n\r\n\"The great sign posts of our policy are equality, similarity, and, if I\r\nmay use such a word, simultaneity of treatment, so far as is practicable\r\nin the development of a genuinely popular system of local government in\r\nall the four countries which form the United Kingdom.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1888 this pledge was fulfilled so far as the counties of England and\r\nWales were concerned, and in regard to those of Scotland in the\r\nfollowing year. When the Irish members, in 1888, introduced an Irish\r\nLocal Government Bill, Mr. Arthur Balfour, as Chief Secretary, opposed\r\nit on behalf of the Government, and Lord Randolph Churchill, who at\r\nthat time, having \"forgotten Goschen,\" was a private member, gave\r\nfurther effect to the solemnity of the declaration, which, as leader of\r\nthe party, he had made two years before, by his strong condemnation of\r\nthe line adopted by the Chief Secretary in respect of a measure, to\r\nwhich, as he said, \"the Tories were pledged, and which formed the\r\nfoundation of the Unionist Party.\" In 1892 the Unionist Government\r\nintroduced, under the care of Mr. Arthur Balfour, a Bill purporting to\r\nredeem these pledges. By one clause, which became known as the \"put them\r\nin the dock clause,\" on the petition of any twenty ratepayers a whole\r\nCouncil might be charged with \"misconduct,\" and, after trial by two\r\njudges, was to be disbanded, the Lord Lieutenant being empowered to\r\nnominate, without any form of election, a Council which would succeed\r\nthe members who were removed in this manner. The criticism which this\r\nprovision aroused was, as was natural, acute. The _Times_ at this\r\njuncture declared that to attempt to legislate would be to court danger.\r\nThe Local Government Bill was abandoned, and in this connection a\r\nsidelight is shed on the sincerity of the promises which had been made,\r\nin a letter from Lord Randolph Churchill to Lord Justice FitzGibbon on\r\nthis question, dated January 13th, 1892, at the time when the Government\r\nof 1886 was drawing to a close, and Mr. Balfour was about to introduce\r\nthe unworkable Bill which was clearly not intended to pass into law.\r\n\r\n\"My information,\" writes Lord Randolph, \"is that a large, influential,\r\nand to some extent independent, section of Tories kick awfully against\r\nIrish Local Government, and do not mean to vote for it. This comes from\r\na very knowledgable member of the Government outside the Cabinet. If the\r\nGovernment proceed with their project they will either split or\r\nseriously dishearten the party, and to do either on the verge of a\r\ngeneral election would be suicidal. This is what they ought to do. They\r\nought to say that Irish Local Government is far too large a question to\r\nbe dealt with by a moribund Parliament; they ought to say that there is\r\nnot sufficient agreement among their supporters as to the nature and\r\nextent of such a measure such as would favour the chances of successful\r\nlegislation, and that they have determined to reserve the matter for a\r\nnew Parliament when the mind of the country upon Irish administration\r\nhas been fully ascertained.\"[2]\r\n\r\nThe reflections suggested by this account of the evolution of a measure\r\nof party policy cannot be edifying to an Englishman or calculated to\r\nappeal as wise statesmanship to an Irishman. For what were the facts? A\r\npolicy denounced as dangerous in the extreme in 1886 by the leader of\r\nthe party was propounded as part of the policy of the same party in the\r\nfollowing year with the acquiescence and, one must suppose, the\r\nimprimatur of its chief. Two years later pledges were thrown to the\r\nwinds, and the excluded minister was provoked to criticism by the\r\ndropping of that line of action, of which he himself four years later is\r\nfound in a private letter to be advising the abandonment on the most\r\nfrankly avowed grounds of pure partisan tactics.\r\n\r\nTwelve years were allowed to elapse before the promises made by Unionist\r\nleaders in the campaign of 1886 were fulfilled by the Local Government\r\nAct of 1898, which, for the first time in the history of Ireland,\r\nestablished by law democratic bodies in the country. One feels inclined\r\nto quote, in reference to the history of this question, that phrase of\r\nthe largest master of civil wisdom in our tongue, as some one has called\r\nEdmund Burke, \"that there is a way of so withholding as to excite\r\ndesire, and of so giving as to excite contempt.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the provisions of the Act, County Councils, Urban District\r\nCouncils, and Rural Councils were set up, and some notion of the\r\nrevolution which it effected may be gathered from the fact that in a\r\ncountry which had hitherto been governed by the Grand Jury in local\r\naffairs the new Act at a sweep established a Nationalist authority in\r\ntwenty-seven out of thirty-two counties.\r\n\r\nUnder the old _régime_ the landlord used to pay one-half of the poor\r\nrate and the occupier the other half. The outcry of the landed interest,\r\nthat under the County Councils they would be liable to be robbed by\r\nexcessive poor rates, resulted in their share being made a charge on the\r\nImperial Treasury, by which means they secured a dole of £350,000 a year\r\nout of the £725,000 concerned in the financial arrangements under the\r\nAct. Of the recipients of this _solatium_ it was pointed out by an\r\nobserver that the family motto of the Marquis of Downshire, who was\r\nrelieved under the Act of liabilities to the extent of more than £2,000,\r\nis--\"By God and my sword have I obtained\"; while that of Earl\r\nFitzwilliam, who had to be content with one-half of that amount,\r\nis--\"Let the appetite be obedient to reason.\" The best answer to the\r\npessimists in whom one suspects the wish was father to the thought, who\r\nprophesied disaster from an Act which they declared would open the door\r\nto peculation and jobbery, is to be found in the Local Government Board\r\nReport for 1903, issued on the expiry of the first term of office of the\r\nCounty Councils. It expressly declares that in no matter have the\r\nCouncils been more successful than in their financial administration,\r\nand goes on to say that the introduction of political differences in the\r\ngiving of contracts and the appointment of officers has occurred only in\r\nquite exceptional cases, and it concludes by declaring its opinion that\r\nthe conduct of their affairs by the various local authorities will\r\ncontinue to justify the delegation to them of large powers transferred\r\nto their control by the Local Government Acts.\r\n\r\nSo much for the working of an Act, of which Lord Londonderry spoke as\r\none \"which the Loyalists view with apprehension and dismay.\" So far as\r\ncertain loss of their supremacy was concerned they might indeed do so,\r\nbut it is not for Englishmen to throw stones, since events have proved\r\nthat it is not in the Irish local bodies, but in some of those of London\r\nitself, that financial scandals have been rife.\r\n\r\nThe one important respect in which the system of local government in\r\nIreland differs from that established in England, Scotland, and Wales is\r\nthat in the first named country the control of the constabulary is ruled\r\nout of the functions of the local bodies, and is still maintained under\r\nthe central executive. The plethora of police in the country is one of\r\nthe most striking features that meet the eye of anyone visiting it for\r\nthe first time. The observant foreigner who, after travelling in\r\nEngland, crosses to Ireland and there sees on every wayside station at\r\nleast two policemen varying the _ennui_ of their unoccupied days by\r\nwatching the few trains that pass through, feels homely pleasure at the\r\nthought that the _octroi_ system which he has missed in England is in\r\nforce in Ireland, and supposes that the men in uniform whom he cannot\r\nfail to see are the officials of the municipal customs. The tradition in\r\nIreland is that half a century ago Smith O'Brien, who was under warrant\r\nfor arrest, was detained at the station at Thurles by a railway guard,\r\nand that atonement has been made ever since for the absence of police on\r\nthat occasion.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Irish Constabulary, than whom it would be difficult to find a\r\nphysically finer lot of men, is a semi-military force living in\r\nbarracks, armed with rifles, bayonets, swords, and revolvers. Well may a\r\nFrench writer exclaim--\"Combien differents du legendaire et corpulent\r\n'bobby,' cette 'institution populaire' de la Grande Bretagne,\" who goes\r\nwithout even a truncheon as a weapon of offence. The numbers of the\r\nRoyal Irish Constabulary, which were largely increased in the days of\r\nwidespread agitation, are still maintained with scarcely any\r\ndiminution. The force, when established just seventy years ago, at a\r\ntime when the population of the country was nearly eight millions,\r\nnumbered only 7,400 men; the population of the island is to-day only\r\nhalf what it was then, but there are now on the force of the\r\nconstabulary 12,000 men, and 8,000 pensioners are maintained out of the\r\ntaxes. In addition to this, there is a separate body of Dublin\r\nMetropolitan Police, and smaller bodies in Belfast and Derry are also\r\nmaintained. The Dublin police force costs nearly six times as much per\r\nhead of population as does that of London. It comprises 1,200 men, and\r\nthere has been a remarkable increase in cost in the last twenty years,\r\nrising to its present charge of £160,950, with no apparent corresponding\r\nincrease in numbers or in pay. The total cost of the police system of\r\nIreland is one and a half million pounds per annum; that of Scotland,\r\nwith an almost equal population, is half a million sterling. To\r\nappreciate the point of this it must be realised that the indictable\r\noffences committed in Ireland in a year are in the proportion of 18 as\r\ncompared with 26 committed in Scotland, while criminal convicts are in\r\nthe ratio of 13 in Ireland to 22 in Scotland.\r\n\r\nSuch a state of things as this, by which the cost of police per head of\r\npopulation is no less than 7s., has only been maintained by the busy\r\nefforts, which Lord Dunraven denounced a couple of years ago, of those\r\nwho paint a grossly exaggerated picture of Ireland, so as \"to suggest to\r\nEnglishmen that the country is in a state of extreme unrest and seething\r\nwith crime.\" The columns of the English Unionist Press show the manner\r\nin which these impressions are disseminated, and there is in London a\r\nbureau for the supply of details of examples of violence in Ireland for\r\nthe consumption of English readers. The Chief Secretary, in the House of\r\nCommons last session, spoke of the fact that he received large numbers\r\nof letters of complaint, purporting to come from different sufferers\r\nfrom violence and intimidation in Ireland, but which, on close\r\nexamination, turned out to be signed by one man. The recent disgraceful\r\nattempt to beat up prejudice on the part of the _Daily Graphic_, which\r\nreproduced what purported to be not the photograph of an actual\r\nmoonlighting scene, but a photograph of \"the real moonlighters, who\r\nobligingly re-enacted their drama for the benefit of our photographer,\"\r\nincurred the disgust which it deserved; but it was only one instance of\r\nan organised campaign of bruiting abroad invented stories of lawlessness\r\nin Ireland which constitutes the deliberate policy of the \"carrion\r\ncrows,\" whose action Mr. Birrell so justly reprobated, and of which the\r\nmost flagrant instances were the purely fictitious plots to blow up the\r\nExhibition in Dublin; an outrage at Drumdoe, which on investigation\r\nproved to be the work of residents in the house which was supposed to be\r\nattacked, and the allegation of a dynamite outrage at Clonroe, in County\r\nCork, which the police reported had never occurred. One would have\r\nthought that the experience which the _Times_ and the Loyal Irish and\r\nPatriotic Union gained at the hands of Richard Pigott would at least\r\nhave made people chary of this form of propaganda. The comparison of the\r\ncriminal statistics of Ireland with those of Scotland which I have made\r\nshows how much truth there is in the imputations of widespread\r\nlawlessness, as does also the number of times on which in each year the\r\nJudges of Assize comment favourably on the presentment of the Grand\r\nJury; and, moreover, the closing of unnecessary prisons which is going\r\non throughout the country is a further proof, if any be needed, of the\r\nfalsity of the charges which are so industriously spread abroad. The\r\nonly gaol in the County of Wexford was closed a few years ago; that at\r\nLifford, the only one in the County of Donegal, has since been closed as\r\nsuperfluous. Of the two which existed till recently in County\r\nTipperary, that at Nenagh is now occupied as a convent, in which the\r\nSisters give classes in technical instruction to the girls of the\r\nneighbourhood; but perhaps the most piquant instance is to be found in\r\nWestmeath, where an unnecessary gaol at Mullingar, having been for some\r\ntime closed, is now used for the executive meetings of the local branch\r\nof the United Irish League. All these, it should be noted, are to be\r\nfound in districts which are inhabited not by \"loyal and law-abiding\"\r\nUnionists, but by a strongly Nationalist population.\r\n\r\nEnough insistence has not been laid on one important fact in the\r\nadministration of the criminal law in Ireland. In England anyone who\r\nalleges that he has been wronged can institute a criminal process, and\r\nthis is a frequent mode of effecting prosecutions. In Ireland the social\r\nconditions in the past have brought it about that the investigation and\r\nprosecution of crime is left to the police, who, as a result, have\r\nattained something of the protection which _droit administratif_ throws\r\nover police and magistrates in France and other Continental countries,\r\nby which State officials are to a large extent protected from the\r\nordinary law of the land, are exempted from the jurisdiction of the\r\nordinary tribunals, and are subject instead to official law administered\r\nby official bodies.\r\n\r\nThe principles on which it is based in countries where it forms an\r\nactual doctrine of the constitution are the privilege of the State over\r\nand above those of the private citizen, and, secondly, the _separation\r\ndes pouvoirs_ by which, while ordinary judges ought to be irremovable\r\nand independent of the Executive, Government officials ought, _qua_\r\nofficials, to be independent to a great extent of the jurisdiction of\r\nthe ordinary courts, and their _actes administratifs_ ought not to be\r\namenable to the ordinary tribunals and judges. The absorption by the\r\nconstabulary of the conduct of prosecutions has tended towards such a\r\nstate of things as this; but a far more potent factor in the same\r\ndirection has been the confusion of administrative and judicial\r\nfunctions which the relations of the resident magistrates to the police\r\nhave engendered, and to an even greater degree has this tendency been\r\naccentuated in the case of the special \"removable\" magistrates appointed\r\nin proclaimed districts under the Coercion Acts, for they are officials\r\nin whom the judicial and the constabulary functions are inextricably\r\nconfounded. That this suspicion of officialism detracts from the\r\nauthority of the police force in popular esteem is undoubted. Their\r\ncomplete dissociation from popular control, the fact that they receive\r\nextra pay for any work performed for local bodies, in addition to\r\nrewards received from the Inland Revenue for the detection of illicit\r\nstills, and the fact the only connection of police administration with\r\nlocal bodies occurs when any county is called upon to pay for the\r\nadditional force drafted into it on account of local disturbance, all\r\nexert their influence in the same direction.\r\n\r\nThat the same curse of extravagance extends to the judiciary in Ireland\r\none would expect from the fact that the number of the High Court Judges\r\nis greater than in Scotland, though, as we have seen, the population is\r\nsmaller and the crime is less. According to a statement made by the\r\nFinancial Secretary to the Treasury a few months ago the salaries of the\r\njudges of the Superior Courts charged on the Consolidated Fund amount to\r\n1s. 1d. per head of population in England and Wales, to 2s. 8d. per head\r\nin Scotland, to no less a sum than 3s. 3d. per head in Ireland. And this\r\ndiscrepancy in cost occurs at a time when the complaint in England is\r\nthat there are not enough judges of the King's Bench, while in Ireland\r\ntheir numbers are excessive.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the attitude of the judiciary in England and in\r\nIreland is to be seen from the fact that M. Paul-Dubois, after quoting\r\nwith approval the Comte de Franqueville's tribute to the fact that the\r\nsumming up of a judge in England is a model of impartiality, goes on to\r\nsay that in Ireland, \"c'est trop souvent un acte d'accusation.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact is that in Ireland, where the salaries of judges are higher\r\nthan the incomes earned by even the most successful barristers, the\r\njudiciary has become to an extent far greater than in England a place of\r\npolitical recompense for Unionist Members of Parliament, who, unlike\r\ntheir English brethren, carry their political prejudices with them on\r\nappointment to the Bench. As recently as 1890 Mr. Justice Harrison, at\r\nGalway Assizes, asked why the garrison did not have recourse to Lynch\r\nlaw, and until his death Judge O'Connor Morris, unchecked by either\r\nparty when in power, month by month contributed articles to the reviews,\r\nin which he denounced in unmeasured terms the provisions of Acts of\r\nParliament which, in his capacity of Judge of a Civil Bill or County\r\nCourt, he was called upon to apply.\r\n\r\nThe jury system is discredited in Ireland by every possible means. Many\r\ncrimes, which in England are classed as felonies, have been statutorily\r\nreduced to misdemeanours in Ireland so as to limit the right of\r\nchallenge possessed by the accused from twenty jurors to six, and at the\r\nsame time, after Lord O'Hagan's Act had withdrawn from the sheriff the\r\npower of preparing jury lists, which he used for political purposes; by\r\nresuscitating a common law right of the Crown which has not been used in\r\nEngland for fifty years, arbitrarily to order jurors to \"stand aside,\"\r\nthe provisions of O'Hagan's Act have been evaded, and a panel hostile to\r\nthe accused is most frequently secured.\r\n\r\nThe natural protection by which the balance is artificially redressed\r\nwhen the application of the laws has not the sympathy of those who are\r\nsubject to them is a common symptom in every country and every age. When\r\nall felonies were capital offences in England, the wit of juries, by\r\nwhat Blackstone called \"a kind of pious perjury,\" was engaged in\r\ndevising means by which those who were legally guilty could escape from\r\nthe penalty; and if it be true that an unpacked jury would possibly in\r\nmany instances of political offences in Ireland have a prejudice in\r\nfavour of the accused, the inference is not consequently to be drawn\r\nthat the ends of justice can only be secured by substituting, as is\r\ndone, a jury which has a prejudice against him. It is not by methods\r\nlike these that are inspired sentiments, such as those which prompted\r\nVictor Hugo eloquently to describe a tribunal:--\"Ou dans l'obscurité, la\r\nlaideur, et la tristesse, se degageait une impression austère et\r\nauguste. Car on y sentait cette grande chose humaine qu'on appelle la\r\nloi, et cette grande chose divine qu'on appelle la justice.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE FINANCIAL RELATIONS BETWEEN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND\r\n\r\n     \"It will not do to deny the obligation. The case (of Ireland's\r\n     alleged over-taxation) has been heard before a competent\r\n     tribunal, established and set up by England. The verdict has\r\n     been delivered; it is against England and in favour of\r\n     Ireland's contention. Until this verdict is set aside by a\r\n     higher court, and a more competent tribunal, the obligation of\r\n     England to Ireland stands proved.\"\r\n\r\n     --T.W. RUSSELL, _Ireland and the Empire_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the history of Great Britain and that of Ireland\r\nduring the last century--in the one case showing progress and\r\nprosperity, advancing, it is not too much to say, by leaps and bounds,\r\nand in the other a stagnation which was relatively, if not absolutely,\r\nretrograde--is one of the most dismal factors in English politics. Those\r\nwho would explain it by natural, racial, or religious considerations are\r\nprobing too deep for an explanation which is in reality much closer at\r\nhand. If the external forces in the two countries throughout that period\r\nhad been the same it would be right and proper to search for an\r\nexplanation in such directions as have been named, but that these forces\r\nhave not been so distributed it is my contention to prove.\r\n\r\nThe closing years of the eighteenth century in Ireland, coinciding as\r\nthey did with the achievement of Parliamentary independence, witnessed\r\nin that country a remarkable growth of national prosperity. Up to the\r\nyear 1795 the taxation of the country never exceeded one and a half\r\nmillions of pounds, and the National Debt was not more than one million.\r\nIn the succeeding years the French war and the rebellion of '98 swelled\r\nthe expenditure, as did the maintenance of an armed force in the\r\ncountry, which was the corollary of the rebellion, and that process\r\nwhich Lord Cornwallis, the Lord Lieutenant, described as \"courting those\r\nwhom he longed to kick,\" by which the Act of Union was passed, added\r\nanother million and a half to the national expenditure.\r\n\r\nThe result of the various causes was that in the year 1799-1800 the\r\ntaxation of the country had risen to three millions, and the National\r\nDebt amounted to just under four millions of pounds.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to enter into these details, because it was on the basis\r\nof the years 1799-1800, and not on that of a year of normal expenditure,\r\nsuch as was 1795, that Pitt and Castlereagh framed the financial clauses\r\nof the Act of Union, which were to establish the taxable relations\r\nbetween Great Britain and Ireland.\r\n\r\nHaving said so much we need not pause to consider how far the financial\r\nclauses were justified. It will suffice to say that they provided that\r\nIreland should pay two-seventeenths of the joint expenditure of the\r\nUnited Kingdom, together with the annual charge upon her pre-union debt.\r\nOne should add, however, that the Irish House of Lords protested that\r\nthe relative taxable capacities of Ireland and England did not bear to\r\neach other the ratio which the Act enunciated of 1 to 7-1/2, but in\r\nreality of 1 to 18.\r\n\r\nIt was no part of Pitt's scheme that there should be fiscal union. A\r\nseparate Irish Chancellor of the Exchequer, drawing up an Irish budget\r\nand regulating an Irish debt, remained after the union of the\r\nlegislatures. Speaking in 1800 on this very point Lord Castlereagh\r\ndeclared that:--\r\n\r\n\"It must be evident to every man that if our manufactures keep pace in\r\nadvancement for the next twenty years with the progress they have made\r\nin the last twenty, they may at the expiration of it be fully able to\r\ncope with the British, and that the two kingdoms may be safely left like\r\nany two countries of the same kingdom to a free competition.\"\r\n\r\nThe seventh article of the Act of Union, which comprised the financial\r\nproposals of the Act, has been summarised as follows in the report of a\r\nRoyal Commission, to which we shall have occasion to refer later:--\r\n\r\n\"Ireland and Great Britain had entered into legislative partnership on\r\nthe clear understanding that they were still, for the purposes of\r\ntaxation, to be regarded as separate and distinct entities. Ireland was\r\nto contribute to the common expenditure in proportion to her resources,\r\nso far as the same could be ascertained, and even after the imposition\r\nof indiscriminate taxation, if circumstances permitted, she might claim\r\nspecial exemptions and abatements.\"\r\n\r\nWe have seen how the taxation of Ireland at the time of the Union was\r\nthree millions. Five years later the figure had risen to four millions,\r\nand it went on increasing at this rate until in 1815 it amounted to no\r\nless than six and a half millions, having more than doubled in amount in\r\na space of fifteen years, while during the same time the National Debt\r\nhad risen from four and a half to ten and a half millions.\r\n\r\nTo understand the significance of these figures it must be realised that\r\nthe Napoleonic war was in progress, and that the supply, on the part of\r\nIreland, of provisions at enhanced war prices was the only means by\r\nwhich she was able to cope with her increasing liabilities. The\r\nconclusion of the war and the consequent fall in prices accelerated a\r\ncrisis in Irish finance. Even in the years of plenty not more than\r\none-half of what the Act of Union proposed could be squeezed out of the\r\ncountry, and the balance, which was added to her debt, raised the ratio\r\nwhich it bore to that of Great Britain from the proportion of 1 to\r\n15-1/2 in 1800 to that of 2 to 17 in 1817. One would have thought that\r\nsuch an increase of debt would have made Ireland less fitted to bear\r\nequal taxation with Great Britain, but the statesmen of the day thought\r\notherwise, and in 1817 the Exchequers were amalgamated. Even then the\r\nfiscal systems of the two countries were not in all respects\r\nassimilated, though in regard to some taxes an equalisation was\r\neffected, as, for example, in the case of tobacco, the duty on the\r\nunmanufactured variety of which was raised from 1s. to 3s. per lb.,\r\nwhile that on cigars and manufactured tobacco was raised from 1s. to\r\n16s. per lb. The manner in which the change affected social conditions\r\nin Ireland at this time may best be illustrated by the fact that the\r\ntaxes on commodities, which necessarily hit the poorest classes hardest,\r\nrose from 4s. a head per annum in 1790 to 11s. a head per annum in 1820.\r\nAfter the Consolidating Act of 1817 the annual taxation fell to about\r\nfive millions, abatements and exemptions being made every year. The\r\ntobacco tax and the Stamp Duty of 1842, which realised about £120,000 a\r\nyear, were, it is true, equalised in the two countries, but for many\r\nyears the system of special treatment was pursued. To Sir Robert Peel\r\ncredit is due for having refused in 1842 to extend to Ireland the Income\r\nTax, which he re-imposed in England, and for reducing the duty on Irish\r\nwhiskey to its original figure by the remission of an additional 1s. per\r\ngallon which he had imposed.\r\n\r\nSoon after this the country supped full of horrors in the famine of\r\n1846-1847. In the decade from 1845 to 1855 more than a quarter of\r\nIreland's population was lost. No sooner did she begin to recover from\r\nthe effects of this visitation than the Repeal of the Corn Laws dealt\r\nher an almost equally disastrous blow. The absence of an industrial side\r\nwhich she might develop, as did England, the almost complete dependence\r\non agriculture, joined to the enfeebled condition in which the lean\r\nyears had left her, made the adoption at this moment of the principle of\r\nFree Trade--in her case--deplorable. Nor was this all. It was at this\r\nmoment that the opportunity was taken by Mr. Gladstone, at that time\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer, to reverse the discriminative policy upon\r\nwhich Peel had so strongly insisted.\r\n\r\nThe Income Tax was applied to Ireland in 1853 at the rate of seven pence\r\nin the pound. Ten years later it had risen to seventeen pence. At the\r\nsame time an additional duty of eight pence a gallon on Irish whiskey\r\nwas exacted, which in two years was multiplied fourfold, while in 1858\r\nDisraeli assimilated for the first time the whiskey duty in the two\r\nislands by raising it in Ireland to 8s. a gallon. The result of this new\r\ndeparture in taxation may be summarised by saying that the Irish revenue\r\nwas raised from just under five millions in 1850 to nearly eight\r\nmillions in 1860, and that, too, at a time when, of all others, her\r\ndistress demanded special treatment and care.\r\n\r\nAlthough the process of assimilation was carried far in 1853 and the\r\nsubsequent years, fiscal unity has never been completely effected. To\r\nthis day Ireland secures exemption from the Land Tax, the Inhabited\r\nHouse Duty, the Railway Passenger Duty, and the tax on horses,\r\ncarriages, patent medicines, and armorial bearings. It will be said, no\r\ndoubt, that Ireland ought to show due gratitude for these exemptions,\r\nbut though they raise collectively a sum of £4,000,000 by their\r\nincidence in England, Scotland, and Wales, it is calculated that if\r\napplied to Ireland they would bring in not more than £150,000 a year, a\r\nsum so small that one may ask whether it would bear the cost of\r\ncollecting.\r\n\r\nBy way of set-off to the imposition of income tax, which it should be\r\nnoted was at the time said to be \"temporary,\" Mr. Gladstone wiped out a\r\ncapital debt of four millions, but it must be pointed out that, in the\r\nfifty years which have ensued, a sum of between twenty millions and\r\nthirty millions has been collected in Ireland as income tax. Objection\r\ncannot--beyond a certain point--be taken to the incidence of this tax,\r\nseeing that it does not fall upon the poorest classes, and that no\r\ncountry benefits more than does Ireland from the substitution of direct\r\nfor indirect taxation. But what does call for censure is that its\r\napplication was not made an occasion for the remission of other taxes.\r\n\r\nIn 1864 the Conservative Government recognised the serious problem of\r\nthe unequal incidence of taxation in the two islands, and appointed a\r\ncommittee to consider their financial relations. Sir Stafford Northcote,\r\nthe chairman of this committee, declared that, notwithstanding the fact\r\nthat they were both subject to the same taxation, \"Ireland was the most\r\nheavily taxed and England the most lightly taxed country in Europe.\"\r\nTwenty-five years later Mr. Goschen, the Conservative Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer, consented to the appointment of another Committee on the same\r\nsubject, but no report was ever issued. In 1895 a Royal Commission was\r\nappointed, comprising representatives of all political parties, and\r\npresided over by a man of commanding ability in the person of Mr.\r\nChilders, a former Liberal Chancellor of the Exchequer. The terms of\r\nreference were \"to inquire into the financial relations between Great\r\nBritain and Ireland and their relative taxable capacity.\" The following\r\nextract will serve to show the conclusions of the Commissioners:--\r\n\r\n\"In carrying out the inquiry we have ascertained that there are certain\r\nquestions upon which we are practically unanimous, and we think it\r\nexpedient to set them out in this report. Our joint conclusions on these\r\nquestions are as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"(1) That Great Britain and Ireland must, for the purposes of this\r\ninquiry, be considered as separate entities.\r\n\r\n\"(2) That the Act of Union imposed upon Ireland a burden which, as\r\nevents showed, she was unable to bear.\r\n\r\n\"(3) That the increase of taxation laid upon Ireland between 1853 and\r\n1860 was not justified by the then existing circumstances.\r\n\r\n\"(4) That identity of rates of taxation does not necessarily involve\r\nequality of burden.\r\n\r\n\"(5) That whilst the actual tax revenue of Ireland is about one-eleventh\r\nof that of Great Britain, the relative taxable capacity of Ireland is\r\nvery much smaller, and is not estimated by any of us as exceeding\r\none-twentieth.\"\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to conceive a more damning indictment of English rule in\r\nIreland. One cannot help recalling the glowing promises of Pitt in\r\n1800:--\r\n\r\n\"But it has been said, 'What security can you give to Ireland for the\r\nperformance of the conditions?' If I were asked what security was\r\nnecessary, without hesitation I should answer 'None.' The liberality,\r\nthe justice, the honour of the people of England have never yet been\r\nfound deficient.\"\r\n\r\nOne is reminded of Dr. Johnson's remark to an Irishman who discussed\r\nwith him the possibility of the union of the Parliaments:--\r\n\r\n\"Do not make a union with us, sir; we should unite with you only to rob\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a striking testimony to the fact that the approach to some men's\r\nhearts is through their pockets; that the report of the Commissioners\r\nbrought all Ulster into line with the Nationalists. Such a vision of the\r\nProtestant lion lying down with the Catholic lamb had not been seen\r\nsince the Volunteers had mustered in 1778, and then, too, curiously\r\nenough, the common cause was financial, being the demand for the removal\r\nof the commercial restraints on the island.\r\n\r\nA conference was held in 1896, presided over by Col. Saunderson, the\r\nleader of the Orangemen, and was attended by all the Irish members,\r\nirrespective of party. The outcome was a resolution in the House of\r\nCommons, proposed by Mr. John Redmond, and seconded by Mr. Lecky. The\r\nrejoinder of the Government to the demands made was to the effect that\r\nthe postulate of the Commissioners that Ireland and Great Britain must,\r\nfor the purposes of the inquiry, be considered as separate entities\r\nstultified the report.\r\n\r\nOne cannot characterise this attitude otherwise than as a piece of\r\nspecial pleading. The appointment, not merely of the Royal Commission,\r\nbut of the Select Committees of 1865 and 1890, presupposed a disparity\r\nbetween the conditions in the two countries which not only existed in\r\nfact but were recognised by law.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the Church, the kind, the police, education, and even\r\nmarriage, the laws are different in the two countries; and we have seen\r\nhow, in respect of such widely separate things as land, railway\r\npassengers, and armorial bearings, the systems of taxation are distinct.\r\n\r\nThe position of the official Conservatives was well stigmatised by one\r\nof the most distinguished among their own body--Mr. Lecky--when he\r\ndeclared that--\r\n\r\n\"Some people seem to consider Ireland as a kind of intermittent\r\npersonality--something like Mr. Hyde and Dr. Jekyll--an integral part\r\nwhen it was a question of taxation, and, therefore, entitled to no\r\nexemptions, a separate entity when it was a question of rating, and,\r\ntherefore, entitled to no relief.\"\r\n\r\nTo the argument that Ireland has no greater claim to relief, on the\r\nscore of her poverty, than have the more backward agricultural counties\r\nof England, the answer is that Wiltshire or Somersetshire--shall we\r\nsay--have always received equal treatment with the rest of the country,\r\nand have never entered into a mutual partnership as did Ireland when she\r\ntrusted to the pledges made to her by England, and expressed in these\r\nterms by Castlereagh:--\r\n\r\n\"Ireland has the utmost possible security that she cannot be taxed\r\nbeyond the measure of her comparative ability, and that the ratio of her\r\ncontribution must ever correspond with her relative wealth and\r\nprosperity.\"\r\n\r\nThe attitude of Ireland in this matter is perfectly plain. While\r\ndeprecating in the strongest terms the means by which the Union was\r\ncarried, she is prepared, so long as it remains in force, to abide by\r\nits terms. It partakes of the nature of what lawyers call a bilateral\r\ncontract, imposing duties and obligations on both sides, and these\r\nliabilities can only be removed--as in the case of the Disestablished\r\nIrish Church--by the consent of both the contracting parties to the\r\ntreaty.\r\n\r\nThe spectacle of the richest country in Europe haggling over shekels\r\nwith the poorest is a sight to give pause, while Great Britain's\r\ninsistence upon her pound of flesh is the more unpardonable because\r\nIreland declares that it is not in the bond. That the highest estimate\r\nof the taxable capacity of Ireland arrived at by the Commissioners was\r\none-twentieth, while the actual revenue contribution of Ireland was\r\none-eleventh of the total for the United Kingdom, throws much light upon\r\nthe social conditions of the smaller island. The rate of taxation per\r\nhead per annum went up in the second half of the nineteenth century more\r\nthan 250 per cent.--rising from about £1 in 1850 to more than £2 10s. in\r\n1900. This occurred simultaneously with a diminution of population in\r\nthe same period from seven millions to four and a half millions, a\r\nchange which is in glaring contrast with the concurrent increase in\r\nGreat Britain from twenty millions in 1850 to more than thirty-eight\r\nmillions at the present day. Whatever may be the other causes which have\r\nled to the stream of emigration from Ireland it may certainly be claimed\r\nthat not least among them is the ever-increasing incidence of taxation\r\nwhich is year by year laying a greater burden upon the privilege of\r\nliving in that country.\r\n\r\nA recent Report, issued by the Labour Department of the Board of Trade,\r\ngives statistics with reference to the earnings of agricultural\r\nlabourers throughout the three kingdoms. It concludes that on an average\r\na labourer in England obtains 18s. 3d. a week, in Wales 17s. 3d., in\r\nScotland 19s. 3d., and in Ireland 10s. 11d. It may be noted that in no\r\nEnglish county is the average lower than 14s. 6d., while in Ireland in\r\nseven counties it is less than 10s., Mayo being the lowest with an\r\naverage wage of 8s. 9d. The present writer has had occasion in the\r\ncourse of the last few months to hear old men on political platforms in\r\na typical English agricultural constituency pointing a moral from their\r\nown or their fathers' recollections of the days before the Corn Laws\r\nwhen wages ran from 8s. to 9s. a week. What is recalled with horror in\r\nEngland as the state of affairs in the \"hungry forties\" is the present\r\ncondition in several of the Irish counties. It would be idle to multiply\r\nproofs to show the desperate condition of the country. Even in the ten\r\nyears which have elapsed since the issue of the Report of the Royal\r\nCommission the taxation of the country has increased by more than two\r\nand a half million pounds, while the population, it is estimated, has in\r\nthe same period diminished by no less than 200,000. On the assumption\r\narrived at by the Commissioners, that the proper share which Ireland\r\nshould pay was one-twentieth of the contribution of Great Britain, the\r\ncountry was overtaxed ten years ago to the extent of two and\r\nthree-quarter millions; yet in spite of that fact in the course of those\r\nten years two millions of additional taxation has been imposed. Two\r\nyears ago the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in answer to an inquiry,\r\nannounced to the House of Commons that in the year 1903-4, the latest\r\nfor which figures were available, the proportions of tax revenue derived\r\nfrom direct and indirect taxes were:--\r\n\r\n                     Great Britain     Ireland\r\n  Direct Taxes       50.6 per cent.    27.8 per cent.\r\n  Indirect Taxes     49.4 per cent.    72.2 per cent.\r\n\r\nThese figures show very clearly to what an extent in Ireland taxation\r\nfalls, not on the luxuries of the rich, but on the commodities which are\r\nto a great extent the necessaries of the poor. The manner in which this\r\nstate of things is maintained was expressed by Sir Robert Giffen in his\r\nevidence before the Royal Commission:--\r\n\r\n\"It is only evident that in matters of taxation Ireland is virtually\r\ndiscriminated against by the character of the direct taxes which happen\r\nto be on articles of Irish consumption.\"\r\n\r\nThe heavy duties on tea, tobacco, and alcohol--articles which form a\r\nlarger part of the family budget of the Irish peasant than of the\r\nEnglish labourer--are the causes of this burden. The reasons for the\r\nlarger consumption of what may be roughly called stimulants by the\r\nIrishman is undoubtedly to be found in climatic conditions, and also in\r\nthe smaller amount of nourishing food which he is able to afford. With\r\nregard to alcohol, the form in which it is most used in England--namely,\r\nbeer--is subjected to a special exemption at the expense of the\r\nwhiskey-drinking people of Ireland and Scotland. Cider is not taxed. The\r\ntax on whiskey is between two-thirds and three-fourths its price, while\r\nthat on beer is one-sixth of its price; so that sixty gallons of beer\r\nbear the same weight of taxation as does one gallon of whiskey. The\r\nusual standard of taxation of liquor is its alcoholic strength, but the\r\nspecial treatment accorded to the Englishman's principal drink\r\nreduced--according to the Royal Commissioners--the taxation to which, in\r\nproportion to its alcohol it should be subjected, from 1s. to 2d. per\r\ngallon. Even in respect of tea and tobacco, the inequitable treatment of\r\nIreland is obvious to any one who considers that what is spoken of as\r\nequality of taxation is, in reality, identical taxation on articles\r\nconsumed in vastly different proportions in Great Britain and Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe argument by which the charge that Ireland is overtaxed was rebutted\r\nby the late Unionist Government was that the balance is restored by the\r\namount of money spent in the administration of that country. When the\r\ncomplaint is heard that she is contributing at this day no less a sum\r\nthan,£9,750,000 to revenue, the answer is made that she has no grievance\r\nsince the cost of Irish services amounts to more than £7,500,000, the\r\nbalance, a paltry two and a quarter millions, forming her Imperial\r\ncontribution.\r\n\r\nIreland is being bled to death, and to her complaints the answer is that\r\nshe is being expensively administered. To fleece a poor man of his\r\npittance and to justify the action by telling him that it is on every\r\nappurtenance of a spendthrift to which he objects that it is being spent\r\nis scarcely to provide a satisfactory justification. The two cases are\r\nexactly parallel, and it is a weak position which has to entrench itself\r\nbehind the fact that the cost of government per head is in Ireland\r\ndouble what it is in England.\r\n\r\nThe country is against its will saddled with a Viceregal Court, of which\r\nthe Lord Lieutenant enjoys a salary twice as great as that of the\r\nPresident of the United States. The government is conducted by more than\r\nforty boards, only one of which is responsible, through a Minister in\r\nthe House of Commons, to the country. Official returns show that\r\nScotland, with a population slightly larger than that of Ireland,\r\npossesses 942 Government officials as against 2,691 in Ireland. In\r\nScotland the salaries of these public servants amount to less than\r\n£300,000, while in Ireland the corresponding cost is more than\r\n£1,000,000 per annum, showing that the average salaries in the poorer\r\ncountry are considerably higher than in the richer. Of the £7,500,000\r\ndevoted to Irish services, £1,500,000 goes to the Post Office and\r\nCustoms, while one half of the remainder is consumed by the salaries and\r\npensions of policemen and officials.\r\n\r\nTo take a single example--the Prison Boards of Scotland and Ireland work\r\nunder identical Acts, dating from 1877. It is instructive, therefore,\r\nto compare the conditions of the two. The estimates for the year 1905\r\nwere calculated on the assumption that there were 120 fewer prisoners a\r\nday in Irish prisons than in Scotland. In spite of this the cost of the\r\nIrish Board for the last year of which I have seen the figures was\r\n£144,597, and that of the Scottish Board was only £105,588. The ratio\r\nbetween these figures is as 1.3 to 1, which is in nearly the same\r\nproportion as is the number of the officials on the two boards--namely,\r\n622 in Ireland and in Scotland 467, and this, too, in spite of the fact\r\nthat further statistics show, namely, that there are five convicted\r\ncriminals in Scotland for every three in Ireland.\r\n\r\nThese are a few facts which show the value of the case for the present\r\nstate of affairs, based on the assumption that over-taxation is balanced\r\nby profligate expenditure. The maintenance--to take only one point--of a\r\npolice force about half the size of the United States army, when at the\r\npresent time white gloves--the symbol of a crimeless charge--are being\r\ngiven to the judges on every circuit, is a state of affairs which is\r\nintolerable, while the small proportion which in the returns Ireland is\r\nshown to bear of the Imperial contribution is the result of the\r\ninclusion of the Viceregal and Civil Service charges, not, as should be\r\nthe case, in the Imperial account, but in the separate Irish account.\r\n\r\nAs an instance showing how exorbitant exactions defeat their own end by\r\ndiminishing, and not raising, the available revenue, it should be noted\r\nthat in 1853 an income tax of 7d. in the pound raised £200,000 more than\r\ndid an income tax of 8d. in the pound at the date of the Royal\r\nCommission. Of the remedies which are suggested, the alteration of the\r\nFiscal system, by making abatements in the Irish Excise and Customs, is\r\nnot likely to be attempted. Reduction of expenditure, liberating money\r\nwhich may be made to serve a useful purpose, is obviously the first\r\nstep, but any scheme of allocation of large sums for Irish development,\r\nwithout full and proper financial control, will undoubtedly fail to meet\r\nthe case. The multiplication of irresponsible boards must be stopped,\r\nand to what extent anything, save economies in expenditure, can be\r\neffected without far larger changes remains a moot point. Of one thing,\r\nat any rate, one may be certain--the present Liberal Government when in\r\nOpposition joined forces with the Irish members in driving home the\r\ntremendous admissions of the Royal Commissioners, and it is impossible\r\nto think that, now they are in power, they will repudiate their\r\nobligations, the more so as the present Chancellor of the Exchequer last\r\nyear announced the intention of the Government to see how far it is\r\npossible to adjust the financial relations between the two kingdoms on a\r\nfairer basis.\r\n\r\nSir Hercules Langrishe, the friend and correspondent of Edmund Burke, is\r\nsaid to have accounted for the swampy condition of the Phoenix Park by\r\nsaying--\"The English Government are too much engaged in _draining_ the\r\nrest of the kingdom to find time to attend to it.\"\r\n\r\nEnough has been said to show that the process of which Sir Hercules\r\nspoke is still going on. One would have thought that counsels of\r\nprudence would have made an end of it. It remains to be seen whether the\r\nuncontestable facts to which they themselves have subscribed will\r\nprevail with the Government. \"The liberality, the justice, the honour of\r\nthe people of England\" are concerned in it now, as truly as when Pitt\r\nspoke. Moreover, it is one of the instances in which the claims of\r\njustice and of expediency coincide. The findings of the Financial\r\nRelations' Commission fully justified the attitude of the Irish Party to\r\nthe proposal, under Mr. Gladstone's Bill, that the Irish contribution to\r\nthe Imperial Treasury should be one-fourteenth of that of Great Britain,\r\nwhile Mr. Parnell declared that it ought to have been one-twentieth.\r\nThe population, since the publication of the Report of the Commission,\r\nhas decreased by a quarter of a million, but taxation has increased\r\nfrom,£7,500,000 to £10,500,000. If Ireland had secured the fixed\r\ncontribution, against the height of which she protested, she would\r\nnevertheless have been guarded from such a disproportionate rise of\r\ntaxation.\r\n\r\nWhatever test be taken, be it population, a comparison of exports and of\r\nimports, the consumption of certain dutiable articles, relative\r\nassessments to death duties, income tax, or the estimated value of\r\ncommodities of primary importance consumed, every one of them shows the\r\nrelative backwardness of Ireland as compared with Great Britain, in view\r\nof which the fact that the cost of government per head of population is\r\ndouble in Ireland what it is in England, shows the extent to which the\r\none is liable in damages to the other. The increased expenditure on the\r\nnavy obviously does not benefit equally the two countries, of which the\r\none only has dockyards and manufactories, and this is especially the\r\ncase seeing that the country which lacks these things is also without a\r\ncommerce needing defence; while any advantage resulting from a portion\r\nof the army being quartered in Ireland is minimised when it is found\r\nthat arms and accoutrements are purchased in England.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to stultify the findings of the Commission on the ground\r\nthat its report was based on a fallacy, since Ireland has no more right\r\nto be considered as a separate entity than an English county, is\r\nremarkably disingenuous in view of the acknowledgment of this in the\r\nseparate treatment which she received in the matter of grants made in\r\nrelief of local taxation and for the establishment of free education in\r\nthe years 1888 and 1890 and 1891. Moreover, it was impliedly admitted\r\nthat she was a separate entity in the appointment of a Select Committee\r\non taxation in 1864, and again by Lord Goschen in 1890, and the whole\r\nhistory of her separate legislation bears the same construction. One\r\ncannot give a better commentary on what has been seen of the economic\r\ncondition of the island than by quoting the peroration of the speech of\r\nJohn Fitzgibbon, Earl of Clare, the \"great father of the Union,\"\r\nspeaking in the Irish House of Parliament:--\"It is with a cordial\r\nsincerity and a full conviction that it will give to this, my native\r\ncountry, lasting peace and security for her religion, her laws, her\r\nliberty, and her property, an increase of strength, riches, and trade,\r\nand the final extinction of national jealousy and animosity, that I now\r\npropose to this grave assembly for their adoption an entire and perfect\r\nUnion of the Kingdom of Ireland with Great Britain. If I live to see it\r\ncompleted, to my latest hour I shall feel an honourable pride in\r\nreflecting on the little share I may have in contributing to effect it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE ECONOMIC CONDITION OF IRELAND\r\n\r\n     \"When the inhabitants of a country leave it in crowds because\r\n     the government does not leave them room in which to live, that\r\n     government is judged and condemned.\"--JOHN STUART MILL,\r\n     _Political Economy_.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have shown something of the incubus of taxation which overpowers\r\nIreland from the fact that she--the poorest country in Western\r\nEurope--is bound to the richest in such a manner that the latter has not\r\nthe common prudence to recognise the flagitious injustice which she is\r\ninflicting, while, by a refinement of cruelty, she repeats her\r\nassurances that Ireland is a spoilt child, and for this reason alone\r\ndoes not appreciate the blessings of British rule. In the light of the\r\nfacts before us one may well ask whether it was an extreme hyperbole of\r\nwhich Grattan made use when he declared that \"Ireland, like every\r\nenslaved country, will be compelled to pay for her own subjugation.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we are urged to put into practice the counsels of perfection and\r\nstudy the virtue of patience while we wait for the opportune moment for\r\nreform, from the point of view of English party politics, our reply is\r\nthat things have reached so desperate a pass that to submit to the\r\ndelays entailed by the exigencies of political strategy is a suicidal\r\npolicy which we cannot afford to endure without protest.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Great Britain had their Imperial taxation cut down in\r\nthe nineteenth century by one-half, that of the Irish people was\r\ndoubled. Every year that passes without radical change in the relations\r\nbetween the two countries makes it more serious, and makes the changes\r\nmore drastic which will be required when the need for them is at last\r\nfully realised.\r\n\r\nAt the present day more than ten millions per annum are raised by\r\ntaxation in Ireland. Of these seven and a half are spent on the _home_\r\ngovernment of the country, which in 1890 cost only just over five\r\nmillions, while that of Scotland at this moment costs a little\r\nmore--namely, five and a half millions.\r\n\r\nIf one looks at the case of Denmark one finds a rich agricultural\r\ncountry with a population of six and a half millions, which is able to\r\nmaintain her home and foreign government, a Royal Family, a debt, an\r\narmy with a war strength of 70,000, a fleet, and the expense of three\r\ncolonies, on an expenditure of four and a half millions.\r\n\r\nSweden, to take another case, with a population of six and a half\r\nmillions, a large commerce, and many industries, is able to support her\r\nwhole government, army, navy, diplomatic and consular service on a\r\nbudget of little more than five millions; and the cost of civil\r\ngovernment of Belgium, with a greater population and four times the\r\ntrade, is one-half that of Ireland. The relative cost of _home_\r\ngovernment per head of population, which amounts in Ireland to £1 14s.\r\n3d., in England and Wales to £1 3s., and in Scotland to £1 3s. 3d.,\r\nillustrates in a striking manner the ruinous condition of the present\r\nincidence in Ireland.\r\n\r\nIf this administrative waste is palliated by the statement that it\r\nretains money in Ireland, the reply is that the excess of administrative\r\nexpenditure which is included in this sum is enough to effect large\r\nmeasures of social reform in the country, the benefit of which is not to\r\nbe named in the same breath with the present mode of maintaining an\r\nextravagant staff of highly-paid officials. As things are, however, all\r\nmotives to secure economies in the Irish services are vitiated by the\r\nexisting system by which any economies in Irish administration go, not\r\nto Ireland, but to the Imperial Treasury, and in this way economical\r\ngovernment is not merely not encouraged but actually discouraged, and\r\nhence it is that one has such contrasts as that to be seen in each\r\nyear's Civil Service Estimates, where, under the item of stationery and\r\npostage in respect of public departments, the amount for the last year\r\nwhich I have seen is, for Scotland £24,000, and for Ireland,£43,000, and\r\nthat the Department of Agriculture, out of a total income from\r\nParliamentary Grant of £190,000, spends no less than £80,000 on salaries\r\nand wages, and another £10,000 on travelling expenses.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Giffen has calculated that the incomes of the wage-earning\r\nclasses in Ireland are, man for man, one-half those of the members of\r\nthe same classes in England. Statistics of every kind bear out the\r\nstriking difference in the conditions of the two countries. The average\r\npoor law valuation in Ireland is about equal to that of the poorest East\r\nLondon Unions, where it is £3. Though the population is between\r\none-seventh and one-eighth of that of England, the number of railway\r\npassengers is one-thirty-seventh, the tons of railway freight is\r\none-seventeenth, the telegrams are one-eighteenth, the postal and money\r\norders are one-nineteenth of those of England.\r\n\r\nIreland, to take another test of prosperity, is the fourth\r\nmeat-producing country in the world and the sixteenth meat-eating, while\r\nEngland, by a curious coincidence, is the sixteenth meat-producing, but\r\nthe fourth meat-eating, country in the world. The one direction in which\r\nthe extension of the powers and duties of the Executive has often been\r\nurged has not been pursued. I mean the matter of railways. Though in\r\n1834 a Royal Commission recommended that Irish railways should be built\r\nwith money from the British Treasury, and should be subject to State\r\ncontrol, nothing was done in the matter. Lord Salisbury and Lord\r\nRandolph Churchill were in 1886 in favour of the nationalisation of\r\nIrish railways, but at that date again no steps were taken. Mr. Balfour,\r\nit is true, when Chief Secretary, secured the passing of the Light\r\nRailways Act, under which powers were obtained to open up the Congested\r\nDistricts by means of light railways, such as those which have been\r\nbuilt to Clifden, in County Galway, and to Burtonport, in County\r\nDonegal. But the policy which was followed in this Act was to build the\r\nrailway out of a Treasury grant, and after it had been built to hand it\r\nover to one of the existing railway companies.\r\n\r\nThere are to-day 3,000 odd miles of railway in Ireland--a mileage\r\nscarcely exceeding that of a single company, the Great Western Railway,\r\nin England. They are owned by nearly thirty companies, each with a\r\nseparate staff of directors and salaried officials, the directors alone\r\nbeing over 130 in number. The railways of the country are, without\r\nexception, notoriously bad, the delay and dislocation incident to the\r\ntransfer of goods from one line to another, and the high rates which\r\nprevail, inevitably serve to impede any traffic in goods, especially if\r\nthey are of a perishable character.\r\n\r\nIt is not traffic that makes communications, but cheap communications\r\nthat make traffic. The Belgian Government, fifty years ago, took over\r\nthe railways of that country, and reduced the freights to such a degree\r\nthat in eight years the quantity of goods carried was doubled, the\r\nreceipts of the railways were increased fifty per cent., and the profits\r\nof the producers were multiplied five-fold. I am not quoting this\r\ninstance by way of plea that the present remedy for the grave economic\r\nproblems of Ireland lies in nationalisation of railways. I have said\r\nenough to show the extravagance and irresponsibility of the present\r\nExecutive system, and in view of that no sane man would propose to endow\r\nit with further powers than those which it already possesses; but let\r\nme say this, that if the present state of diffusive impotence which\r\nrules in the matter of transit in the country continues, some very\r\ndrastic remedies may before long have to be devised.\r\n\r\nThe cheapest freights for grain in the world are those between Chicago\r\nand New York, and the reason why this is so is that there exists keen\r\ncompetition on the part of the inland waterways. Of the 580 miles of\r\ncanals in Ireland a considerable part are owned by the railway\r\ncompanies, and their weed-choked condition shows the use to which they\r\nare put in the national economy.\r\n\r\nWhoever it was that said the carriers of freight hold the keys of trade\r\nwas stating what appears almost an axiom, and an illustration is\r\nafforded of the results of reduced rates in an analogous business in the\r\nway in which the establishment of penny postage sent up the receipts of\r\nthe General Post Office.\r\n\r\nThe difference in the freights in the three kingdoms may be seen by a\r\ncomparison of the average rate per ton of merchandise in the year 1900--\r\n\r\n  In England    In Scotland     In Ireland\r\n\r\n  4s. 10.26d.   4s. 11.64d.     6s. 7.90d.\r\n\r\nIn the decade from 1890-1900 the figure in England and Wales decreased\r\n8.79d., in Scotland 1.7d., and in Ireland increased by 1.92d.\r\n\r\nAgain, the control of the great English railway corporations over the\r\nsmall companies in Ireland has led to a state of things by which\r\nfreights for imported goods are relatively lower than are those for\r\npurely internal carriage, and by this means the railways of Great\r\nBritain maintain their grip of the carrying trade, and incidentally\r\ndestroy the industry of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe trade of Ireland is not two per cent. of that of the three kingdoms,\r\nand this policy of swamping the Irish market with English-made goods at\r\nlow rates to such an extent that over twelve million pounds' worth of\r\nimported goods are sold annually in Ireland shows the manner in which\r\nthe principles of free trade are applied to that country; and so it has\r\ncome to pass that the opening up of the country by railways has often\r\ntended to destroy local industries and to substitute for their products\r\narticles manufactured in England and Continental Europe at a cheaper\r\ncost, carried in either case by English railways, which, in consequence,\r\nreap the benefit of the freight. The carriage per ton paid by eggs to\r\nLondon, to take one example, is 16s. 8d. from Normandy, 24s. from\r\nDenmark, and no less that 94s. from Galway.\r\n\r\nThe bearing of the transit question on the agricultural problem is seen\r\nby a consideration of the rates for every form of farm produce, which in\r\nIreland are fifteen to twenty per cent. of their value. On the Continent\r\nthe average is five to six per cent., and in the United States and\r\nCanada it is three per cent. The discouragement of such a tariff to\r\nagricultural enterprise has had a great bearing on the transformation of\r\nplough land into cattle ranches, and the extent to which this has\r\noccurred may be seen from the fact that there are to-day twelve million\r\nacres of pasture to three millions of arable land in the island, and\r\nfertile land, like that of the plains of Meath, is to be seen growing,\r\nnot corn for men, but grass for cattle. The success of the country in\r\nstock-raising may very easily be rendered nugatory if the exclusion of\r\nArgentine and Canadian cattle from the English market be ended by the\r\npassing of an Act giving the Board of Agriculture a discretionary power\r\nto maintain or remove the embargo on their importation, according as the\r\ndanger of an introduction of cattle disease exists or disappears. The\r\nenormous import trade which is done in Danish butter, Italian cheese,\r\nand even Siberian eggs, shows the commercial possibilities of farm\r\nproduce when freights are low. As a tangible example of the\r\ndiscrimination which the railways pursue may be mentioned the fact that\r\nthe freight for goods per ton from Liverpool to Cavan is 10s. 8d., while\r\nthat from Cavan to Liverpool is 16s. 8d. The numbers employed on\r\nagriculture have diminished, not only in proportion to the population\r\nbut also relatively to its decrease. According to Mr. Charles Booth land\r\nemploys as many people to-day in England as it did in 1841, and it\r\nprobably supports nearly as many, and though in that country, building\r\nand manufacture employ a vast number more, in Ireland there has been in\r\nthe same time a decrease of nearly eleven per cent. of those so\r\nemployed--the total decrease being 626,000.\r\n\r\nThe population of England has in the last century been multiplied by\r\nfour, that of Scotland has increased threefold, while that of Ireland\r\nhas decreased by one-fourth. If we take the last sixty years it will be\r\nseen that the people of England have doubled their numbers, but those of\r\nIreland have divided by two. It would be idle to pretend that the great\r\nexodus which took place after the famine was in all respects to be\r\nregretted. The abnormal increase in population which took place in the\r\nfirst forty years of the nineteenth century was in itself out of all\r\nproportion to the increase of productive capacity in the country, and\r\nwas closely related to the unnatural inflation of prices, and consequent\r\nspurious appearance of prosperity, due to the great war. When the climax\r\ncame this was rapidly followed by a reaction, and when emigration\r\nreduced the numbers of eight million people who were in the island in\r\n1841, the modified competition in the labour market and in the land\r\nmarket tended to restore prices to a normal figure.\r\n\r\nEmigration was at one time a well-recognised remedy with English\r\nstatesmen for Irish ills. Did not Michael Davitt once say that manacles\r\nand Manitoba were the two cures for Ireland which they could propose?\r\nEven then, no attempt was made to regulate emigration by the State. The\r\nball which was thus set rolling at that date has been in motion ever\r\nsince, and that which half a century ago was regarded as the hand of the\r\n_deus ex machina_ setting right a grave economic problem has continued,\r\nso that it has become at this day a problem no less grave, which to an\r\nequal degree presses for solution.\r\n\r\nFour million people in the last sixty-five years fled from the country,\r\nand though the figures, as they are published, seem to show a slight\r\ndecrease each year, the apparent diminution is to a large extent\r\nfallacious, since the residue of population from which emigrants are\r\ndrawn becomes each year less, and an apparent decrease may in truth be a\r\nrelative increase.\r\n\r\nWe heard much a few years ago in England of the evils of immigration\r\ninto the British Isles of aliens, whom the Board of Trade returns show\r\namount to eight thousand per annum--a figure which appears paltry when\r\ncompared with the forty thousand people who leave Ireland every year. It\r\nis a cry which one is told should make the thirty-seven million\r\ninhabitants of England and Scotland burn with indignation that this\r\nnumber of foreigners land on their shores every year. Surely we Irishmen\r\nhave a far greater cause of complaint in the fact that out of a\r\npopulation of four and a half millions, less than is that of London, a\r\nnumber greater than those of a town of the size of Limerick emigrate\r\nevery year. Most of these emigrants are in the prime of life. Their\r\naverage age is from twenty to twenty-five, and more than ninety per\r\ncent. are between the ages of ten and forty-five years. Here is the\r\ncrucial fact, that it is the young, the active, and the plucky who are\r\nbeing tempted by promises of success abroad, to which they see no\r\nlikelihood of attaining at home, and in this way is established a system\r\nof the survival of the unfittest, an artificial selection of the most\r\nmalignant kind, which is leaving the old, the infirm, the poor, and the\r\nunadventurous behind to swell the figures of pauperism and to propagate\r\nthe race. All the authorities are agreed in attributing to this cause\r\nthe lamentable increase of lunacy, which is one of the most terrible\r\nfactors in the economy of modern Ireland. The last Census report shows\r\nthe total number of lunatics and idiots to have been in 1851 equal to a\r\nratio of 1 in 637 of the population, and to be in 1901 equal to a ratio\r\nof 1 in 178. The proportion is, as one would expect, highest in the\r\npurely agricultural districts and lowest in the neighbourhood of cities,\r\nsuch as Dublin and Belfast, where industrial conditions imply better\r\nwages and food, and a less monotonous existence.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that the proportion of imbeciles in Great\r\nBritain has risen in the period of fifty years as it has in\r\nIreland--partly, no doubt, owing to a better system of registration of\r\nlunacy--but, at the same time, the fact remains that the average in\r\nIreland is very much greater than in England and Wales, rising in some\r\nIrish counties to a proportion twice, and in another to a ratio thrice,\r\nas high as that of the average of the whole of England and Wales.\r\n\r\nIf urban industrial conditions militate against an increase of lunacy,\r\non the other hand it must be remembered that in most Irish towns there\r\nis an appalling amount of overcrowding. The death-rate of Dublin--the\r\nhighest of any city in Europe--is, in consequence, no less than 25 per\r\n1,000, as against 16 per 1,000 in Paris and New York, and 17 per 1,000\r\nin London. The percentage of families, consisting on an average of four\r\npersons, living in one room is in London 14.6, in Edinburgh 16.9, in\r\nGlasgow 26.1, in Cork 10.6, in Limerick, 15.8, while in Dublin it\r\nreaches the appalling percentage of 36. In Belfast, which, unlike any\r\nother of the cities which I have mentioned, is for the most part modern,\r\nthe percentage is not higher than 1, and this fact has a very great\r\nbearing on the industrial conditions in that city. Side by side with\r\nthese figures may be placed those of the death-rate from tuberculosis,\r\nwhich from 1864 to 1906 in England decreased from 3.3 per 1,000 to 1.6,\r\nin Scotland decreased from 3.6 per 1,000 to 2.1, and in Ireland\r\n_increased_ from 2.4 to 2.7 per 1,000.\r\n\r\nThe rate war of the steamship companies, which reduced the cost of\r\npassage across the Atlantic in 1904, caused the emigration returns to\r\nrise from 45,000 to 58,000 in a single year, and at the same time there\r\nwere employed in Ireland two hundred emigration agents of one company\r\nalone--the Cunard--each of whom received six shillings a head for each\r\nbanished Irishman and Irishwoman whom he got safely out of the country.\r\nIt is easy for the Irishman to wax eloquent about the exiles who, from\r\nthe time when O'Neil and O'Donnell weighed anchor in Lough Swilly at the\r\nvery beginning of the seventeenth century, sailed from their country to\r\nseek their fortunes abroad in Church or State or camp, since\r\nproscription deprived them of the _carrière ouverte aux talents_ at\r\nhome. The history of the \"wild geese\" in the service of France, Spain,\r\nItaly, Austria, Prussia, and of Russia; of the Irishmen who were\r\nrespectively the first Quartermaster-General of the United States Army\r\nand the first Commodore of the United States Navy, or of the seven Irish\r\nField Marshals of Austria, or of those who served as Viceroys to Chili,\r\nPeru, and Mexico, is the story of the citizens of no mean city. Catholic\r\nEurope is flecked with the white graves of the Irish exiles of the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries; from Rome to Valladolid, from\r\nDouai to Prague, from Salamanca to Louvain, and from Tournai to Paris\r\nyou will find their bones. But the pathos of this is, to my mind, as\r\nnothing compared with the pathos of what is occurring now. For one\r\nthing, it was only men in those days that went in any large numbers,\r\nwhile to-day it is both men and women. From the point of view of England\r\nthe result has been in no small degree serious. Of the four million\r\npeople who have emigrated since the great tidal wave began with the\r\nfamine, nearly ninety per cent. have gone, not to British Colonies, but\r\nto the United States. Of the fifty thousand who emigrated in 1905 more\r\nthan forty-four thousand went to the North-American Republic.\r\n\r\n_Coelum non animum mutant qui trans mare currunt_; the Ulster\r\nProtestants who were driven from their country by the commercial\r\nrestrictions of the eighteenth century formed the nucleus of the most\r\nimplacable enemies of Great Britain in the War of Independence--half\r\nWashington's army was recruited from Irishmen in America; and in the\r\nsame way the exiles of the nineteenth century became, and have remained\r\neven to the second generation, irreconcilable adversaries of the system\r\nof government which, by affording for too long no relief to the\r\nconditions in Ireland, was responsible for the flight from their home to\r\na land which was, by comparison, flowing with milk and honey.\r\n\r\nSide by side with emigration goes on another factor in the social life\r\nof the country which is very significant of the stress under which, in\r\nsome districts, the Irish peasant ekes out an existence. I am referring\r\nto the migratory labourers, of whom nearly 18,000 leave their homes in\r\nIreland every year to work in the harvest fields of England and\r\nScotland, that they may there secure a wage by which they are able to\r\nmake both ends meet in a manner which the uneconomic nature of their\r\nholdings does not permit. How small is the diminution in this annual\r\nmigration is seen by the fact that the highest figures in connection\r\nwith it recorded in the last quarter of a century are those of 1880, in\r\nwhich year nearly 23,000 migrated, while within the last six years--in\r\n1901--the figures were as high as 19,700. More than three-quarters of\r\nthese labourers come from Connacht, and of the total number more than\r\none-half from County Mayo, from which every year 47.8 per thousand of\r\nthe population migrate, and if one takes the adult male\r\npopulation--_i.e._, that of men over twenty years of age--one finds that\r\nthe number of migratory labourers represents a proportion of 177.4 per\r\nthousand. Nearly three-quarters of them go to England, and the harvest\r\nfields of Lincolnshire and Yorkshire are in a large measure reaped by\r\ntheir hands. From February till June the migration occurs, and the\r\nlabourers return in the late autumn to their homes. The fact that the\r\nsum brought back by them is, at the highest estimate, said to be about\r\n£18 after nine months of labour, and that the wages which they earn\r\namount to an average of 17s. a week, while, in addition to the cost of\r\nliving for three-quarters of the year, about £2 is spent on their\r\nrailway fare, all serve to show the nature of the economic conditions in\r\nthe West of Ireland which make such a migration for such a wage worth\r\nwhile on the part of nearly twenty thousand people. One factor in this\r\nconnection which should be noted is that the number of girls who migrate\r\nevery year is said to be increasing, and is estimated to amount to\r\nnearly half the total throughout the country. The precariousness of a\r\ndependence on such a means of subsistence as this, is seen from the fact\r\nthat a bad harvest in England or a development in agricultural machinery\r\nwould put an end to the source of livelihood which it provides. If from\r\nno other point of view the problem should be regarded seriously by\r\nEnglishmen in the light of the depopulation of the English countryside,\r\nwith its direct bearing upon the material for recruiting the army and\r\nnavy, and the problem of unemployment in general.\r\n\r\nIt is a surprising thing that the support of home industries, which was\r\none of the foibles of Dean Swift, who advised Irishmen to burn\r\neverything that came from England except its coal, has only of very\r\nrecent years been resuscitated. So much is this the case that the action\r\nof the South Dublin Board of Guardians, who in 1881 insisted that the\r\nworkhouse inmates should be clothed in Irish produce, was conspicuous by\r\nits exceptional nature. At this day all are agreed, whatever be their\r\nreligious or political opinions, on the advocacy of this form of\r\nexclusive dealing at which economists may scowl as at a deliberate\r\nattempt to fly in the face of the regular play of the forces of supply\r\nand demand, but the success which has so far attended the concerted\r\npolicy of insisting upon being supplied with Irish produce, and the fact\r\nthat it is, after all, the only mode of restoring to their natural\r\nfunctions the economic forces in a country where industrial conditions\r\nwere, by artificial means, thrown out of their natural course, is the\r\njustification for its employment.\r\n\r\nIf for no other reason, the activity displayed by \"religious\" in Ireland\r\nin the encouragement and development of local industries as a check on\r\nemigration should protect them from the attacks which have been made\r\nupon them, as tending to encourage the uneconomic aspect of the\r\nsituation in Ireland. To name only a few that come into one's mind, the\r\nnuns' co-operative factories, which have revived Irish point lace at\r\nYoughal, Kenmare, Gort, Carrick-on-Suir, Carrickmacross, and Galway, are\r\ninstances. Father Dooley, in Galway, has started a woollen factory, with\r\na capital of £10,000, in which nearly two hundred girls are employed, of\r\nwhom many earn £1 10s. a week. Father Quin, at Ballina, has founded a\r\nco-operative shoe factory, and at Castlebar Father Lyons has established\r\nan electric power station. The work of the Sisters of Charity at Foxford\r\nis well known, and stands in need of no praise, and at Kiltimagh, in\r\nMayo, they employ a hundred and twenty girls at dress and lace making;\r\nwhile Father Maguire, at Dromore, in Tyrone, has established a lace and\r\ncrochet factory on co-operative principles, which has over a hundred\r\nemployees; and at Lough Glynn, in Connacht, a carpet and cheese making\r\nindustry has been built up solely through the efforts of a religious\r\norder of nuns. These are random examples, and I do not claim that they\r\nare typical. They are, on the other hand, not exceptional.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to exaggerate the effect of the English commercial\r\npolicy towards Ireland in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.\r\nWool, cotton, sailcloth, sugar refining, shipping, glass, the cattle and\r\nprovision trade, were all deliberately strangled. And besides the loss\r\nof wealth to Ireland which was the consequence, one must take into\r\naccount the fact that traditions of commercial enterprise perished\r\nthrough desuetude, so that in the industrial revolution at the beginning\r\nof the nineteenth century Ireland was too severely crippled to derive\r\nany benefit from the new order, as to which she was still further\r\nhandicapped by the poverty of her coal fields.\r\n\r\nThe land system, which is only now disappearing, served, moreover, not\r\nto inculcate habits of thrift, but positively as a discouragement of\r\neconomic virtues. Until the legal recognition of tenant-right had been\r\nsecured, the tenant who made improvements was liable to have his rent\r\nraised, and was aware that he had no legal right to compensation for\r\nthem on his removal from the holding. Further, the judicial fixing of\r\nrents, which, as the time for rent revision has approached, has\r\npresented to the tenant the temptation not to make the best of his land,\r\nand so run the risk of an augmentation of rent, has been a source of\r\ninsidious demoralisation to the occupant of the soil.\r\n\r\nThe social upheaval resulting from land purchase will nowhere be more\r\nmarked than in this respect in the stability which it will produce in\r\nthe financial conditions of the country, and it may be expected to do\r\nsomething to remedy the lamentable state of things which so far has but\r\nlittle altered from that of twenty years ago, when it was estimated that\r\nfive-sixths of the total capital of the country was invested abroad. A\r\ngreat opportunity presents itself at the present moment. It was stated a\r\nfew years ago that eleven millions of rent were spent out of the island.\r\nAt this day when, under the Land Purchase Act, an immense amount of\r\nproperty is being realised, the patriotic Irish landlord seeking an\r\ninvestment for his money can, by starting industries in Ireland, at one\r\nand the same time do a patriotic work by providing against the stream of\r\nemigration, and can secure a safe and profitable investment for his\r\npurchase-money. There are very nearly eighty million pounds of capital\r\nto be set free under the Act, and it is scarcely too much to expect that\r\na large proportion of it will be invested by the expropriated landlords\r\nin their own country. The possibility of an industrial revival in\r\nIreland is well illustrated by the increase in the number of\r\nco-operative societies, in which there are at the present day 100,000\r\nmembers, while less than twenty years ago there were only fifty.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the Dairy, Agricultural, and Poultry Societies is very\r\nimportant, but perhaps of still greater importance are the Raffeisin\r\nbanks, which aim at the promotion of farming by means of co-operative\r\ncredit. The loans which they make, at an interest of five per cent. or\r\nsix per cent., are dealing a death-blow at that curse of Irish life--the\r\ngombeen man, whose usury used to mount up to thirty per cent. The\r\nextremely rare cases of default in the repayment of these loans for\r\nagricultural purposes will not be surprising to those who recall the\r\ntribute paid by Mr. Wyndham, in connection with land purchase annuities,\r\nto the Irish peasant as a debtor whose reliability is unimpeachable.\r\nMore than twenty years ago the Baroness Burdett Coutts made a loan of\r\n£10,000 to the fishermen of Baltimore, with a view to the development of\r\ntheir industry, and the unfailing punctuality with which payments were\r\nmade afforded another instance of the reliability which is a\r\ncharacteristic of the Irish peasant. This brings one to note in passing\r\nthat of all others the fishing industry has probably suffered most from\r\nthe lack of proper means of transit. The 2,500 miles of coast line offer\r\ngreat scope, but the catch of fish off the Irish coast is only\r\none-eighth of that off Scotland, and one-sixteenth of that off England\r\nand Wales, and Irish waters are to a very large extent fished by boats\r\nfrom the coasts of Scotland, the Isle of Man, France, and Norway. Oyster\r\nfisheries used to abound--the celebrated beds at Arcachon in the Landes\r\nwere stocked from Ireland--but they have fallen into disuse, and with\r\ntheir disappearance a very remunerative business has been lost. The need\r\nfor extensive and scientific forestry one may also note is obvious, from\r\nthe fact that there are seven million acres of former woodland which are\r\nnow reduced to a waste. The results of planting a shelter bed of pines\r\non the north and west coasts, as a protection from the Atlantic winds,\r\nwould be very great, while the industrial effect of systematised\r\nforestry would be immense. Bark for tanning, charcoal, moss, resin,\r\nmanure from fallen leaves, litter, fuel, and mushrooms are some of the\r\nbye-products of this reproductive industry, while by planting willows,\r\nwhich yield a rapid return, along bogs a basket weaving industry might\r\nvery rapidly be developed. The need, however, for planting on an\r\nextensive scale and the inevitable delay before any returns for\r\nexpenditure accrue, make forestry essentially an object not for private\r\nbut for public enterprise.\r\n\r\nIt is not generally known that in 1831 Ireland grew one-fifth of the\r\ntobacco consumed in the three kingdoms, but that in that year the first\r\nLiberal Government which was in power for a generation put down a\r\nprofitable industry for which the turfy soil of the country was\r\nparticularly well adapted. With the help of a shilling rebate it is\r\nbeing shown, on an experimental area, that tobacco can be grown\r\nsuccessfully in Ireland. At present the Treasury has refused to allow\r\nany extension of the area under cultivation, and it remains to be seen\r\nwhether the united demands of Irish members--Unionist as well as\r\nNationalist--will secure the removal of the prohibition against its\r\ngrowth, and so possibly lead to a re-establishment of its cultivation on\r\na similar scale to that of three-quarters of a century ago.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most important and, one may surmise, far-reaching step\r\nwhich has been taken in respect of Irish industries in the last few\r\nyears is to be found in the registration, under the Merchandise Marks\r\nAct of 1905, of a national trade-mark, the property in which is vested\r\nin an association, which, on payment of a fee, grants the right to use\r\nit to manufacturers of the nature of whose credentials it is satisfied.\r\nThe value of this is obvious as giving a guarantee of the country of\r\norigin of goods at a time when the increased demand for Irish produce\r\nhas added to the number of unscrupulous traders who sell as \"made in\r\nIreland\" goods which are not of Irish manufacture. It is said that\r\ntwenty years ago most of the tweed which was placed upon the market\r\nwhich had been made in Ireland was sold as Cheviot, and that to-day the\r\n_rôles_ are reversed, and it is certain that for many years the great\r\nbulk of Irish butter masqueraded in English provision shops as Danish.\r\nThe income of the association is devoted to the taking of legal action\r\nagainst traders who fraudulently sell as Irish, foreign including\r\nEnglish made goods. If an instance is needed of the results which the\r\nprotection of a national trade-mark gives in the encouragement of\r\nindustry, by the guarantee of origin which it entails, it is to be found\r\nin the success of similar action in the cases of the butter industries\r\nof Sweden and Austria. It is a great tribute to the Trade-Mark\r\nAssociation that within two years of its incorporation the Congested\r\nDistricts Board has applied for the use of the trade-mark for the\r\nproducts of its lace classes and for its homespuns.\r\n\r\nThe task proposed by Henry Grattan to the Irish Parliament may well be\r\ntaken to heart by the Irish people to-day:--\"In the arts that polish\r\nlife, the manufactures that adorn it, you will for many years be\r\ninferior to some other parts of Europe, but to nurse a growing people,\r\nto mature a struggling, though hardy, community, to mould, to multiply,\r\nto consolidate, to inspire, and to exalt a young nation, be these your\r\nbarbarous accomplishments.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE LAND QUESTION\r\n\r\n     \"I can imagine no fault attaching to any land system which\r\n     does not attach to the Irish system. It has all the faults of\r\n     a peasant proprietary, it has all the faults of feudal\r\n     landlordism, it has all the faults incident to a system under\r\n     which the landlords spend no money on their property, and\r\n     under which a large part of the land is managed by a Court; it\r\n     has all the faults incident to the fact that it is to the\r\n     tenant's interest to let his farm run out of cultivation as\r\n     the term for revising the judicial rent approaches.\"\r\n\r\n     --A.J. BALFOUR, on the Second Reading of the Land Bill, May\r\n     4th, 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reason for the importance of the system of land tenure in the social\r\nconditions of Ireland is to be found in the manner in which the\r\nrestrictions on Irish commerce in the seventeenth and eighteenth\r\ncenturies drove the population to secure a livelihood in the only\r\ndirection left open to them--namely, agriculture. The results of this\r\nare to be seen to-day in the fact that there are 590,000 holdings in the\r\nisland, and that out of a total population of four and a half million\r\npeople it is well within the mark to say that three and a half million\r\nare dependent, directly or indirectly, on the land for their means of\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nThe system of tenure in Ireland was as different as possible from that\r\nexisting in Great Britain. The gist of the difference lay in this, that\r\nin England and Scotland landlords let farms, while in Ireland they let\r\nland. \"In Ireland,\" wrote an English observer more than a hundred years\r\nago, \"landlords never erect buildings on their property, nor expend\r\nanything in repairs.\" This feature, which was the result of historical\r\nreasons, was due to the fact that Irish land-owners were the descendants\r\nof settlers intruded on Irish land, who brought with them English\r\nnotions of tenure, but had not the capital to render economic the\r\nnumerous small holdings situated on their estates. Hence it came about\r\nthat the provision of capital by an English landlord for the equipment\r\nof farms with cottages, outhouses, fencing, and a drainage system, which\r\nresults in a sort of partnership between landlord and tenant, was, to a\r\nlarge extent, a thing unknown in Ireland, where, as was aptly said,\r\ntenants' improvements were landlords' perquisites, and where point was\r\nlent to the differences by the fact that the few properties on which the\r\nequipment of the holdings was provided by the landlord were known as\r\n\"English-managed estates,\" and the number of these, Lord Cowper told the\r\nHouse of Lords in 1887, could be counted on one's fingers.\r\n\r\nIrish landlords have been compared, not to English squires, but to the\r\nground landlords of London, bound to the occupiers only in so far as\r\nthey received from their tenants a rent-charge liable to increase as the\r\ntenant improved the holding, or as competition arose with the growth of\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for this state of things are to be found in the number and\r\nthe small size of the Irish holdings, but more than this in the fact\r\nthat from the first landlords came there in a business capacity.\r\n\r\n\"Les uns comme les autres,\" says a French writer, M. Paul-Dubois, \"ils\r\nn'ont vu dans la terre Irlandaise qu'une affaire, et non une patrie. Ils\r\nsont restés conquérants en pays de conquête. De là cette conséquence\r\nque, conscients d'être des étrangers, des intrus, ils se sont crus\r\nlibres et quittes de toute dette envers le pays, de tous les devoirs de\r\nla propriété.\"[3]\r\n\r\nPlanted on land which was confiscated, and, as a result, insecurely\r\nheld, to risk the expenditure of money would have been unnatural, the\r\nmore so since the expenditure which, in the circumstances, fell upon the\r\ntenant in the matter of improvements, provided the best possible\r\nsecurity to the landlord by making the tenant all the more anxious to\r\nremain on the holding on which he had sunk what little capital he\r\npossessed, and in consequence virtually obliged, at risk of ejection, to\r\nsubmit unwillingly to periodical enhancements of rent.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the few English-managed estates it was only in Ulster\r\nthat matters were otherwise, owing to the existence of the custom--an\r\nembryo copyhold, Lord Devon called it--known as tenant-right. On the\r\nvarious confiscations of land, grants of which had been made to the\r\n\"undertakers,\" many of the latter were either public bodies, such as the\r\ngreat City Companies, others were landlords who, even if not resident at\r\na distance, had neither the means nor the inclination to spend the\r\nnecessary money on their estates. This was provided by the tenant, who,\r\nwithout aid from the landlord, made improvements on his holding by his\r\nown labour; and in Ulster, where the tenants were settlers from England\r\nand Scotland, there arose an equitable proprietorship vested in the\r\noccupier, by which, on quitting the farm, he was entitled to claim from\r\nthe new tenant a sum of money partly in compensation for the money and\r\nlabour he had invested in the holding and partly as a price paid for the\r\ngoodwill or possession, which the new tenant would have no other means\r\nof acquiring. The nature of this \"Ulster Custom,\" which, until 1870, had\r\nno sanction or protection from the law, was clearly defined by the\r\nMaster of the Rolls, in the case of M'Elroy _v._ Brooke, in the\r\nfollowing words:--\"The essentials of the custom are the right to sell, to\r\nhave the incoming tenant, if there be no reasonable objection to him,\r\nrecognised by the landlord, and to have a sum of money paid for the\r\ninterest in the tenancy transferred.\" The English system we see then,\r\nwith its competitive rent fixed by contract, and subject to the laws of\r\nsupply and demand, did not exist; the social and prescriptive ties which\r\nin England bound the owner and the occupier to each other never arose\r\nunder this state of things, and in their absence did not arise one of\r\nthe strongest inducements to a landed gentry to live on their estates\r\nand to concern themselves in the welfare of their tenants, a social\r\nsystem which, by the interchange of kindly offices wherever in England\r\nthe proprietors live on their property, does much to make the\r\ncountryside attractive to the poorer classes and to check migration.\r\n\r\nThere is no more erroneous idea than to suppose, as do some people, that\r\nthere was a large body of resident landed proprietors in Ireland until\r\nthe land war drove them to seek safety across the Channel. As a matter\r\nof fact, long before this had begun there existed an absentee\r\naristocracy dependent on middlemen or agents--\"the vermin of the\r\ncountry,\" Arthur Young called them--who constituted a mere mechanical\r\nmedium for the collection of rent, and as such were the worst exponents\r\nof the amenities which, in happier circumstances, are supposed to\r\nsubsist between owners and occupiers of agrarian land. At the beginning\r\nof the nineteenth century the increase of population in the island and\r\nthe high prices resulting from the war led to a very great sub-division\r\nof holdings, while the exercise of the franchise by the forty shillings\r\nfreeholder until the year 1829 provided an additional inducement to the\r\nlandlord to multiply the number of tenants on his land, since by doing\r\nso he increased the number of votes under his control, and, _pari\r\npassu_, his political influence.\r\n\r\nAfter the famine, when it was found that one-third of the Irish\r\nlandlords were bankrupt, the Encumbered Estates Court Act was passed to\r\ncope with the situation which had arisen of a country full of numerous\r\nlandlords saddled with land which, owing to mortgages, debts, and\r\nincumbrances, was inalienable. Under the Act the Court was empowered, on\r\nthe petition of any person sufficiently interested, to sell the\r\nencumbered estate and give an indefeasible title, so that persons who\r\nbefore had a claim on the estate should now have a claim only on the\r\npurchase-money. It was a piece of strong legislation in its disregard of\r\nvested rights and in the manner in which it set aside express contracts\r\nunder which creditors had a claim on the land which could only be\r\ndisturbed by paying off that claim.\r\n\r\nIn the event the rush of creditors to this Court--created to afford\r\nrelief from the delays of Chancery in effecting alienation--was so great\r\nthat, as a result of the consequent fall in prices, land became a drug\r\nin the market, and properties in many instances did not realise enough\r\nto meet the mortgages. To the landlords ruined in this manner succeeded\r\na new class, who bought up bankrupt estates, often with borrowed money,\r\nas a commercial speculation, and caring nothing for the tenant or his\r\nwelfare, looking only on the business side of the transaction, raised\r\nrents arbitrarily to such a pitch that the tenantry were unable to meet\r\ntheir liabilities. Wholesale evictions ensued, and in this wise arose\r\nthe condition of things in which the _Times_--never an unfriendly critic\r\nof the landed interest--was constrained to admit in 1852 that \"the name\r\nof an Irish landlord stinks in the nostrils of Christendom.\"\r\n\r\nBy an Act of 1858 the Encumbered Estates Court was replaced by the\r\nLanded Estates Court, which had power to carry out the sale of, and give\r\nan indefeasible title to, any interests in land, whether hypothecated or\r\nnot, and after the passing of the Judicature Act of 1877 the name of the\r\nCourt became the Land Judges' Court.\r\n\r\nThe disfranchising clauses of the Emancipation Act, and the consequent\r\ndisappearance of the advantages accruing to the landlords from a\r\nmultiplication of holdings on their estates, the miserable poverty\r\nresulting from the famine, the anxiety of the proprietors to escape the\r\nburdens of the remodeled Poor Law, and the demand by the new class of\r\nland speculators for large grazing or tillage farms, to form which the\r\nconsolidation of existing holdings was demanded, were the factors which\r\nresulted in the clearances of 1849 and the subsequent years. \"Notices to\r\nquit,\" in a historic phrase, \"fell like snowflakes,\" at a time when it\r\nwas truly said that an eviction was equal to a sentence of death. In a\r\nfew months whole counties, such as those of Meath and Tipperary, were\r\nconverted into prairies; cabins were thrown down, fences removed, and\r\npeasants swept off, and in ten years nearly 300,000 families were\r\nevicted from their homes, and a million and a half of the population\r\nfled across the Atlantic. \"I do not think,\" said Sir Robert Peel--and\r\nhis verdict has been endorsed by the judgment of history--\"I do not\r\nthink that any country, civilised or uncivilised, can offer similar\r\nscenes of horror.\"\r\n\r\nThe Devon Commission, the Report of which was issued in 1845,\r\nrecommended that in future compensation should be given to Irish tenants\r\nfor permanent improvements effected by them. Bills to carry out the\r\nrecommendation of the Commission were introduced in 1845 by Lord\r\nStanley, in 1846 by Lord Lincoln, and in 1852 by Mr. Napier, the\r\nAttorney-General for Ireland. But it was not until the Act of 1870 was\r\npassed--a quarter of a century after the Report of the Commissioners had\r\nbeen issued--that its recommendations were embodied in an Act of\r\nParliament. So far was this from being the case with the next statute\r\ndealing with Irish land--Deasy's Act, passed in 1860--that it aimed at\r\nthe substitution of the commercial principles of contract for the\r\nequitable principles of custom in the relations between landlord and\r\ntenant, in this respect that it refused to allow compensation to the\r\ntenant for improvements other than those made with the landlord's\r\nconsent. The object of this Act--the last word of the Manchester School\r\non the Irish Land Question--was, therefore, to destroy any claim by a\r\ntenant in respect of future improvements, unless under the terms of\r\nsome contract, express or implied. In point of fact, the Act proved\r\nalmost a dead letter, and the one result which ensued from its passing\r\ninto law was to make the position of the tenant less secure, in so far\r\nas it made the process of ejectment less costly and more simple, and\r\nenabled the landlord in many instances to confiscate improvements.\r\n\r\nTwenty-three Bills in favour of the tenants were thrown out in the forty\r\nyears which followed Emancipation. The struggle between landlord and\r\ntenant was occupied with the attempts of the latter to enforce the\r\ncustom of tenant-right in Ulster, and secure its application in the\r\nother provinces. The Land Act of 1870, for the first time, gave legal\r\nsanction to this principle by giving the tenant a claim to compensation\r\nfor disturbance. It gave its imprimatur to the doctrine that an Irish\r\ntenant does not contract for the occupation of a farm, that Irish land\r\nis not the subject of an undivided ownership, but of a simple\r\npartnership. The pecuniary damages to which a landlord was liable under\r\nits provisions was a blow aimed at wanton evictions, and with the\r\ncurtailment of the power arbitrarily to effect these, the threats by\r\nwhich landlords had been able unjustly to raise rents were robbed of\r\nmuch of their force.\r\n\r\nThe tenant under the Act secured a recognition of his property in the\r\nland and of his right to occupy it, provided he complied with certain\r\nconditions, and, in addition, he obtained compensation, albeit\r\ninadequate, for disturbance for non-payment of rent, in cases in which\r\nthe Court considered the rent exorbitant, and in which failure to pay\r\nwas due to bad seasons. Thus tenant-right, which Lord Palmerston had\r\ndismissed with epigrammatic flippancy as landlord wrong only a few years\r\nbefore, received the sanction of law from his own party.\r\n\r\nIn actual practice under the Act the landlords recouped themselves for\r\nthe compensation which they had to pay to an evicted tenant by raising\r\nthe rent on his successor in the tenancy in the comparatively few cases\r\nin which the evicted tenant could afford the legal costs which the\r\nfiling of a claim for compensation entailed, but this much at least had\r\nbeen secured, that the virtual confiscation of the tenants' improvements\r\nhad been stopped. The Act of 1870 had been passed to prevent arbitrary\r\nevictions and to secure to the tenant compensation for improvements, and\r\nin certain cases for disturbance. It succeeded only in making arbitrary\r\nevictions more costly for the landlord, it gave the tenant no fixity of\r\ntenure since the compensation for disturbance was inadequate. To remedy\r\nthis Isaac Butt in 1876 introduced a Bill based on the \"three F.s\"--fair\r\nrent, free sale, and fixity of tenure--but it was rejected by 290 votes\r\nto 56, and several other amending Bills were thrown out by the House of\r\nCommons between 1876 and 1879. In 1880 the Government were at last\r\nstirred to action in the introduction of the Compensation for\r\nDisturbance Bill, which caused the retirement of Lord Lansdowne from the\r\nCabinet, and was followed by threats of resignation on the part of the\r\nDuke of Argyll. Under the Act of 1870 only those occupiers were entitled\r\nto claim compensation for disturbance whose rents were not in arrear. By\r\nthis Bill it was proposed to extend the right to that claim to all those\r\nwho were unable to pay as a result of bad harvests, and who were willing\r\nto hold their farms on just and reasonable terms, which the landlord\r\nrefused.\r\n\r\nAfter passing through the House of Commons, in spite of Lord Randolph\r\nChurchill's denunciation of it as the first step in a social war, the\r\nBill, although there had been a large majority in its favour in the\r\nlower House, was thrown out by the House of Lords at a time when the\r\nneed for remedial legislation was illustrated by the presence in Ireland\r\nof 30,000 soldiers and 12,000 policemen for the protection of life and\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Commission, under the chairmanship of Lord Bessborough, which\r\nwas then appointed, reported in the following year that the Land Act of\r\n1870 afforded no protection to the tenant who remained in his holding,\r\nsince compensation for improvements could only be claimed on giving up a\r\ntenancy. The Commissioners, by a majority of four to one, declared\r\nthemselves in favour of the \"three F.s,\" which the leader of the\r\nOpposition denounced as \"Force, Fraud, and Folly,\" and the Commissioners\r\njustified their attitude by this statement, which was echoed by the\r\nRichmond Commission, which reported soon after,--\"freedom of contract,\r\nin the case of the majority of Irish tenants, large and small, does not\r\nreally exist,\" the reason being that tenants in occupation were ready to\r\npay any rent rather than sacrifice the capital and labour they had sunk\r\nin their holdings. The good seasons after 1870 had made this rise in\r\nrent possible, but with the bad winter of 1880 the results became\r\ndisastrous.\r\n\r\nIn this manner the \"three F.s,\" which the Land League demanded, and\r\nwhich were secured by the Act of 1881, were conceded against the will of\r\nthe Government by sheer force of circumstances. A rumour which gained\r\ncurrency early in 1880, that the Bessborough Commission would report in\r\ntheir favour, was stigmatised by Mr. Gladstone as incredible, and the\r\nadoption of the principle enunciated by the Commissioners resulted in\r\nthe resignation from the Cabinet of the Duke of Argyll. The demands\r\nwhich had been made in 1850 by the Tenant League, the first concerted\r\naction of North and South since the Union, were repeated. They included\r\na fair valuation of rent, the right of a tenant to sell his interest at\r\nthe highest market value, and security from eviction so long as he paid\r\nhis rent. Their claims were scouted in 1870, and it was not till eleven\r\nyears had passed that in 1881 these \"three F.s\"--fair rent, free sale,\r\nand fixity of tenure, the notion of which had so recently been\r\nrepudiated by Mr. Gladstone--were secured by the Land Act of that year,\r\nwhich recognised to the full the dual ownership of Irish land by\r\noccupier and landlord. Under this Act also was created a Court to fix\r\nfair rents for judicial periods of fifteen years.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone himself had admitted that the Land Act of 1870, which a\r\nConservative member, destined to be a future Chief Secretary--Mr. James\r\nLowther--described as \"pure Communism,\" together with the Church Act of\r\n1869, was the outcome of the Fenian agitation of the sixties, which drew\r\nthe attention of English statesmen to the Irish question. In the same\r\nway the passing of the Act of 1881, which made a far more active assault\r\nupon their prerogatives, secured from a house of landlords through fear\r\nthat which they denied on grounds of equity. \"In view of the prevailing\r\nagitation in Ireland,\" said Lord Salisbury of this measure which\r\nassailed every Tory principle as to the sacredness of property, \"I\r\ncannot recommend my followers to vote against the second reading of the\r\nBill.\" What Fenianism had effected in 1870 the Land League secured in\r\n1881. \"I must record my firm opinion,\" said Mr. Gladstone ten years\r\nlater, \"that the Land Act of 1881 would not have become the law of the\r\nland if it had not been for the agitation with which Irish society was\r\nconvulsed.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bill was denounced by the Tories as one of the most unquestionable\r\nand, indeed, extreme violations of the rights of property in the whole\r\nhistory of English legislation.[4] Lord Salisbury declared that it would\r\nnot bring peace, and that henceforth the Irish landowner would look upon\r\nParliament and the Imperial Government as their worst enemies. The Earl\r\nof Lytton declared that it was revolutionary, dangerous, and unjust;\r\nthat it would organise pauperism and paralyse capital; yet for all that\r\nhe warned their lordships that its rejection might be the signal for an\r\ninsurrection, of which the whole responsibility would be thrown on the\r\nHouse of Lords. But perhaps Lord Elcho expressed the feeling which\r\npredominated in the Gilded Chamber when he expressed the opinion that\r\nthe Bill was the product of \"Brummagem girondists.\" In the event, as we\r\nhave seen, Lord Lytton's warning bore fruit, and the Bill was passed.\r\n\"There is scarcely a less dignified entity,\" as Disraeli had said in\r\nConingsby thirty years before, \"than a patrician in a panic.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the Act, let me repeat, for the first time was frankly recognised\r\nthe legal partnership between the tenant who provided the working gear\r\nand the landlord who provided the bare soil. The latter could only evict\r\nthe tenant on default, the tenant was at liberty to sell his occupancy\r\ninterest at will without the leave of the landlord, and the rent payable\r\nby the tenant to the landlord was to be fixed by a judicial\r\ntribunal--the Land Commission--the establishment of which was but the\r\ncarrying out of a suggestion made three years before by Parnell. The\r\nresults of the agitation which had brought about the passing of the Act\r\nwere seen when the Court decreed an average reduction of Irish rents by\r\n20 per cent., knocking off no less than £1,500,000 at one stroke from\r\nthe rack-rentals of the country.\r\n\r\nThe Act was not applicable to tenants whose rent was in arrear--those,\r\nthat is to say, who were in the poorest circumstances--and a Bill\r\nintroduced by Parnell in 1882 to wipe out these arrears by a grant of\r\npublic money, was thrown out, being denounced by Lord Salisbury as a\r\ndangerous precedent of public plunder to mislead future generations.\r\n\r\nAs ballast to lighten the Act of 1881 the leaseholders were thrown\r\noverboard. For this exclusion from the benefits of the Act there was, on\r\nprinciple, no excuse. A Bill of Parnell's to remedy it was thrown out in\r\n1883 by a majority of four to one, and the 35,000 tenants who suffered\r\nfrom it were not entirely accorded the privileges of the other tenants\r\nuntil the passing of the Rent Redemption Act of 1890. The average\r\nreduction in rent effected for this class of tenant has amounted to 35\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\nOne further fact in connection with the Act of 1881 deserves mention as\r\nshowing that though Parliament may propose a remedy for an admitted\r\ngrievance, the Courts of law are able to dispose its application by\r\ntheir interpretation in direct contravention of the intentions of the\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\nSection 8, sub-section 9, of the Act of 1881 provided:--\"No rent shall\r\nbe allowed or made payable in any proceedings under this Act in respect\r\nof improvements made by the tenant or his predecessors in title, and for\r\nwhich, in the opinion of the Court, the tenant or his predecessors in\r\ntitle shall not have been paid or otherwise compensated by the landlord\r\nor his predecessors in title.\" In the case of Adams _v_. Dunseath, in\r\nFebruary, 1882, it was held by the Court of Appeal, in the teeth of the\r\nobvious intention of Parliament, that the fact that a tenant had for a\r\nlonger or shorter period of time enjoyed the benefit of his improvements\r\nmight be taken into consideration by the judge as being an equivalent\r\nfor compensation and as serving to limit the reductions in rent effected\r\nby the Commission on land which had been subjected to these\r\nimprovements. By this interpretation many thousands of pounds were put\r\ninto the landlords' pockets during the years which intervened before\r\n1896, when it was superseded by a provision in the Act of that year\r\nwhich re-affirmed and established the principle, the enactment of which\r\nhad been intended in 1881.\r\n\r\nWe must now turn to the introduction of land purchase. In 1847 Lord John\r\nRussell, in a project which was subsequently dropped, advocated, as did\r\nJ.S. Mill in later years, the solution of the land question by the\r\nestablishment of a peasant proprietary. The nidus, however, out of which\r\nthis policy germinated was the right of pre-emption which John Bright\r\nsecured for the tenants of ecclesiastical land under the Church Act of\r\n1869. A further step in the same direction was taken in the Land Act of\r\n1870--not more than two-thirds of the purchase-money being advanced to\r\nthe tenant under its provisions. Under the Church Act 6,000, and under\r\nthe Act of 1870 1,000, tenants purchased their farms.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 Parnell urged the establishment of peasant proprietorship, and\r\nunder the Act of 1881 three-quarters of the purchase-money was to be\r\nadvanced on such terms as to be repayable by instalments of five per\r\ncent, per annum for thirty-five years, but only 1,000 tenants took\r\nadvantage of the facilities thereby offered.\r\n\r\nFour years later was passed the Ashbourne Act, so called from the Irish\r\nLord Chancellor responsible for its introduction, and in it we have the\r\nfirst Act--purely for land purchase--which has been applied to Ireland.\r\nBy it the Treasury found the whole of the purchase-money up to a total\r\nof five millions sterling out of the Irish Church Surplus Fund, and\r\nforty-nine years were allowed for repayment of the purchase-money to the\r\nState at 4 per cent., of which £2 15s. was interest on the advance and\r\n£1 5s. went to a sinking fund for the liquidation of the loan.\r\n\r\nOnly 2,000 tenants took advantage of the terms of this Act, but it is\r\nnevertheless of importance as marking the point at which the principle\r\nof peasant proprietorship was recognised as the solution by both English\r\nparties. In this way was realised, not much more than twenty years ago,\r\nthe importance of that change of ownership which, in Arthur Young's\r\nwell-known phrase, turns sand into gold, and which has progressed ever\r\nsince. A shrewd French observer--Gustave de Beaumont--saw in 1837 that\r\nthis was the way out of the _impasse_ of the Irish land system, and half\r\na century ago a great opportunity presented itself at the time of the\r\nEncumbered Estates Act of establishing a peasant proprietary, when more\r\nthan two million acres--one-sixth of the whole soil of Ireland--were\r\nsold in ten years, and were bought in lots of 200 to 250 acres by some\r\n8,000 to 10,000 land-jobbers.\r\n\r\nThe Land Bill which Mr. Gladstone introduced as a pendant to the Home\r\nRule Bill of 1886 offered to every Irish landlord the option of selling\r\nhis estate to his tenants, who would thereby become occupying owners at\r\nonce, paying an interest of 4 per cent. for forty-nine years on the\r\nprice, which would be twenty years' purchase of the judicial rents, paid\r\nby the State issue of fifty million pounds of Consols with the revenues\r\nof Ireland as security. After the Unionist victory of 1886 Mr. Parnell\r\nbrought in a Bill which also was destined never to receive the Royal\r\nAssent, but which again is of importance in view of subsequent\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nHe based his demand upon the fall in prices which prevented tenants from\r\npaying judicial rents. By this Bill it was proposed that the Land Court\r\nshould have power to abate rents fixed prior to 1885 if it were proved\r\nthat the tenants could not pay the whole amount, and would pay one half\r\nand arrears, and further, if these amounts were paid evictions and\r\nproceedings for the recovery of rent should be suspended, and, lastly,\r\nthe Bill aimed at the inclusion of leaseholders under the Act of 1881.\r\n\r\nIt was roundly denounced by the landlords.[5] Lord Hartington declared\r\nthat were it to pass it would have the effect of stopping the payment of\r\nrent all over Ireland, and Sir Michael Hicks Beach spoke of it as \"one\r\nwhich, though purporting to be a mere instalment of justice to the poor\r\nIrish tenant, is an act of gross injustice and confiscation to the\r\nlandlords of Ireland.\" The Bill was thrown out by a majority of\r\nninety-five, and the Plan of Campaign on the part of tenants against the\r\npayment of impossible rents was the result.\r\n\r\nA Royal Commission, under the chairmanship of Lord Cowper, was appointed\r\nto inquire into the administration of the Land Laws. The Commission\r\nreported in January, 1887, and bore out the grounds on which Parnell\r\nhad based his Bill of the previous year. It felt \"constrained to\r\nrecommend an earlier revision of judicial rents on account of the\r\nstraitened circumstances of Irish farmers.\" It recommended that the term\r\nof judicial rents should be lowered from fifteen years to five, that\r\nthose rents already fixed should be revised, and that leaseholders\r\nshould be brought under the Act of 1881. In reference to the Bill of the\r\nyear before Lord Salisbury had said that the revision of judicial rents\r\nwould not be honest and would be exceedingly inexpedient.[6] The Bill,\r\nwhich is known as Lord Cadogan's, which was introduced on the last day\r\nof March, 1887, and which purported to carry out the recommendations of\r\nthe Cowper Commission, opened the Land Court to leaseholders, setting\r\naside in this way the more solemn forms of agrarian contract. As regards\r\nauthorising the reduction of judicial rents on the ground of the fall in\r\nprices, it did nothing, and the Prime Minister repeated his opinion that\r\n\"to do so would be to lay your axe at the root of the fabric of\r\ncivilised society.\"[7]\r\n\r\nMr. Balfour, who, in the month of March, had become Chief Secretary,\r\nproclaimed with equal force that it would be folly and madness to break\r\nthese solemn contracts.[8] In the Bill, as at first brought in, the\r\nCourt had, in fact, power to vary contracts by fixing a composition for\r\noutstanding debts and determining the period over which payment should\r\nextend. In May the Government accepted the principle that the Court\r\nshould not only do this (settle the sum due by an applicant for relief\r\nfor outstanding debt), but also should fix a reasonable rent for the\r\nrest of the term. The Ulster tenants insisted on this, but, at the\r\nbidding of the landlords, it was subsequently withdrawn, and, finally,\r\nin July the Premier summoned his party and, telling them that if the\r\nBill were not altered Ulster would be lost to the Unionist cause, passed\r\ninto law a Bill sanctioning a general revision of judicial rents for\r\nthree years, and in this way did the Tories lower rents in breach of a\r\nclause in the Act of 1881 that guaranteed rents fixed under its\r\nprovisions for a term of fifteen years.\r\n\r\nAs a speaker of the day put it--\"You have the Prime Minister rejecting\r\nin April the policy which in May he accepts, rejecting in June the\r\npolicy which he had accepted in May, and then in July accepting the\r\npolicy which he had rejected in June, and which had been within a few\r\nweeks declared by himself and his colleagues to be inexpedient and\r\ndishonest, to be madness and folly, and to be laying an axe to the very\r\nroot of the fabric of civilised society.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the advance of five millions for land purchase under the Act of\r\n1885 was nearly exhausted, a further sum of equal amount was earmarked\r\nfor the same purpose in 1888. Lord Randolph Churchill in 1889 expressed\r\nthe opinion that something like £100,000,000 of credit should be pledged\r\nto effect purchase. In 1891 Mr. Balfour authorised the devotion of a\r\nfurther sum of £33,000,000 for this purpose. The whole of the\r\npurchase-money was to be advanced by the State by the issue of\r\nguaranteed land stock, limited to the amount stated, and giving a\r\ndividend at two and three-quarters per cent., repayment being effected\r\nin forty-nine years by the purchaser by the payment of an annuity on his\r\nholding of four per cent. The Act was too complicated to work well, but\r\nunder its provisions 30,000 sales occurred, in comparison with 25,000\r\nwhich had been effected under the Acts of 1885 and 1888. The passing of\r\nthis Act marks the close of the experimental stage in land purchase.\r\nUnder the Land Act of 1896 was asserted the principle of compulsory sale\r\nin the case of estates in the Landed Estates Court, whose duty it was to\r\nsell bankrupt property, if they came under certain specified conditions,\r\nand if a receiver had been appointed to them.\r\n\r\nThis roused the fury of the landlords to the highest pitch. \"You would\r\nsuppose,\" said Sir Edward Carson, \"the Government were revolutionists\r\nverging on socialism.... I ask myself whether they are mad or I am mad?\r\nI am quite sure one of us must be mad.\" In spite of denunciations of\r\nthis order the clause respecting compulsory sale of the estates\r\nmentioned was passed, occupying tenants having in those cases the right\r\nof pre-emption. Under its provisions the period for the repayment of the\r\nmoney advanced was extended to sixty-eight years. The annuity payable by\r\nthe tenant during the first decade was to be calculated and made payable\r\nupon the total purchase-money advanced, but at the end of each of the\r\nfirst three decennial periods, as the debt was reduced by the\r\naccumulation of sinking fund, the annuity was to be re-calculated and\r\nmade payable on the portions of the advance remaining unpaid. Under the\r\nAct every purchaser was to start with a reduction of not less than 25\r\nper cent. on the rent which he had hitherto paid, and this amount was to\r\nbe still further reduced by not less than 10 per cent. at the end of\r\neach of the first three periods of ten years. This Act effected the sale\r\nof 37,000 holdings. The applications for sale under it numbered 8,000 in\r\n1898, and in the succeeding years the number steadily diminished, so\r\nthat they amounted in 1899 to 6,000, in 1900 to 5,000, and in 1901 to\r\nonly 3,000. The reasons for this are not difficult to find. The payment\r\nin Consols was profitable so long as securities stood at a high figure,\r\nbut the expenses arising from the South African war resulted in a fall\r\nof Stocks from 112 to 85, and as a result new terms for land purchase\r\nbecame imperatively needed. In consequence Mr. Wyndham brought in a Bill\r\nin 1902, which was, however, stillborn, but its withdrawal was\r\naccompanied with a promise of legislation in the following session. The\r\nsituation in the winter of 1902 was critical. An Irish Land Trust had\r\nbeen formed by the landlords to oppose the United Irish League, and on\r\nthe 1st of September there was issued a Viceregal proclamation, putting\r\nthe Coercion Act in force in Dublin and Limerick. By a curious\r\ncoincidence, the papers published the same day a letter from Captain\r\nShaw Taylor, an Irish landlord, inviting representatives of tenants and\r\nlandlords to meet in conference in Dublin and discuss a way out of the\r\nagrarian _impasse_. The proposal was scouted by the _Times_, the _Daily\r\nExpress_, and the Dublin _Daily Express_, but was favourably received by\r\nthe Press in other quarters. A motion by Lord Mayo at the Landowners'\r\nConvention, in favour of the conference, was rejected by 77 votes to 14.\r\nA poll on the question being demanded, 4,000 landlords, each with an\r\nestate of more than 500 acres, received voting papers, and of these\r\n1,706 replied, 1,128 in favour and 578 against a conference, while the\r\nsmall landlords were almost unanimously in its favour. A second appeal\r\nwas then made to the Landowners' Convention through its president, Lord\r\nAbercorn, but an answer in the negative was received, for it went on to\r\nsay--\"It would be merely to give long-discredited politicians a\r\ncertificate of good sense and of just views, we might almost say of\r\nlegislative capacity to sit in an Irish Parliament in Dublin, were we to\r\naccept Captain Shaw Taylor's invitation to join them.\"\r\n\r\nThe criticism of an unbiassed foreign observer on this attitude of rigid\r\ncast-iron _non possumus_ is instructive. \"Rappelons nous,\" writes M.\r\nBechaux, \"que le parti irlandais au Parlement, si grossièrement insulté\r\nrepresente 4/5 du peuple irlandais, nous avons un specimen de l'esprit\r\nréactionnaire et irréconciliable du landlordisme irlandais.\" In spite of\r\nthis the Conference met at the end of the year. The landlords'\r\nrepresentatives were:--Lord Dunraven, Lord Mayo, Col. Hutcheson Pöe, and\r\nCol. Nugent Everard; and those of the tenants were:--Mr. John Redmond,\r\nMr. W. O'Brien, Mr. T.W. Russell, and Mr. T.C. Harrington. On the 3rd\r\nJanuary, 1903, a joint report to serve as the basis of the new Bill was\r\nissued.\r\n\r\nThe Report was in favour of purchase as the only possible policy to be\r\ncarried out on such terms that the yearly payments of the tenants\r\nshould be 15 to 25 per cent. lower than second term rents, while the sum\r\nreceived by the landlords was to be such as at 3 or 3-1/4 per cent.\r\ninterest would yield them the same income as second term rents, less 10\r\nper cent. deduction, as an equivalent for the cost of collection under\r\nthe old system. The difference between these two sums was to be bridged\r\nby a bonus from the Treasury to the landlords in the interests of\r\nagrarian peace. The Report was further in favour of enlarging small\r\nholdings by dividing up grazing lands, and under it evicted tenants who,\r\nas such, were not entitled to have judicial rents fixed were to be given\r\nthe option to purchase.\r\n\r\nSecond term rents are those fixed for the second judicial period of\r\nfifteen years under the Act of 1881, and they were on an average 37 per\r\ncent. less than those before the passing of that Act.\r\n\r\nUnder the Act which Mr. Wyndham introduced on March 25th, 1903, the\r\nTreasury may advance a sum up to one hundred millions at 2-3/4 per cent.\r\ninterest, with another 1/2 per cent. sinking fund. The advances to the\r\ntenants, which are limited to £5,000 or, in exceptional circumstances,\r\n£7,000, are made in cash by the Land Commissioners, of whom three,\r\nserving as the Estates Commissioners, are expressly responsible for the\r\nworking of the Act. A Treasury loan at 2-3/4 per cent. provides the\r\nnecessary funds. Under the Act the issue of this Stock was limited to\r\nfive million pounds a year for the first three years, but in January,\r\n1905, this was changed to a sum of six million. By adding to the 2-3/4\r\nper cent. interest which the tenants pay on the loan the further sum of\r\n1/2 per cent. which they contribute to sinking fund for repayment, we\r\narrive at 3-1/4 per cent. which they have to pay for sixty-eight and a\r\nhalf years to obtain the fee-simple of their land. The security which\r\nMr. Wyndham produced for the repayment of interest was the credit of the\r\nIrish peasantry, of whom, out of more than seventy thousand purchasers\r\nowing an eighth of a million to the State under previous Purchase Acts,\r\nonly two had incurred bad debts, which, as being irrecoverable, had\r\nfallen on the taxpayer. As a further safeguard the payment is secured by\r\nthe annual grants-in-aid paid by the Treasury to the County Councils,\r\nwhich can be withheld on default to pay interest on purchase advances.\r\nIn order to facilitate sales the system of \"zones,\" which has been so\r\nmuch canvassed, was devised. Under it the Estates Commissioners are\r\nbound to make advances of purchase-money in all cases in which the total\r\nannuity paid by the tenant ranges from 10 to 40 per cent. less than the\r\nrent which he has hitherto paid. If it be a first term rent the\r\nreduction must be at least 20 and not more than 40 per cent. less, and\r\nif it be a second term rent there must be a reduction of not less than\r\n10 and not more than 30 per cent. It will be, perhaps, clearer if put in\r\nthis way. If a first term rent amounts to £100, then the\r\ntenant-purchaser has to pay at least £60, and at most £80, as annuity,\r\nwhile if the £100 represent second term rent the yearly payment varies\r\nfrom a minimum of £70 to a maximum of £90.\r\n\r\nIf purchases are proposed outside the zones, in which, that is to say,\r\nthe annuity proposed is under 10 or over 40 per cent. of the judicial\r\nrent, the estate must, before sales are effected, be surveyed by the\r\nEstates Commissioners in order that they may see whether the security is\r\nsound, and whether the equitable rights of all parties concerned seem to\r\nbe safeguarded, and without this sanction advances will not be made in\r\nthe case of sales in these circumstances. The amount received by the\r\nlandlord, of course, does not, if invested in Trust Securities at 3-1/4\r\nper cent., provide the same income as did his rent roll, even when one\r\ntakes into account the 10 per cent. for collection to which we have\r\nreferred. On the other hand, he is secured from the possibility of\r\nfurther reductions in rent in the future, and there is a likelihood that\r\nthe securities in which he invests may rise, but, in addition to this,\r\na sum of twelve millions of bonus is to be devoted to bridge the gap\r\nbetween his former rent from the tenant and his present income from his\r\ninvestments.\r\n\r\nUnder this provision every landlord gets 12 per cent. bonus on his sale,\r\nand this sum is part of his life estate, and need not, therefore, be\r\ninvested in trust securities, but may be invested in stock yielding a\r\nhigher rate of interest. This point was not clear in the Act of 1903,\r\nbut was explicitly enacted in an amending Act of 1904.\r\n\r\nIn order further to accelerate sale an investigation of title deeds,\r\ndocuments which a great English lawyer--Lord Westbury--once described as\r\n\"difficult to decipher, disgusting to touch, and impossible to\r\nunderstand,\" is not necessary prior to sale; for an enjoyment for six\r\nyears of the rents of an estate brings with it the right to sell, and\r\nproof of title is needed only after purchase has been completed in order\r\nthat the vendor may establish his right of disposal of the proceeds, and\r\nas further inducement he gets a sum not exceeding one full year's\r\narrears of rent, or at most 5 per cent. of the purchase price.\r\n\r\nThe good results which have accrued where a peasant proprietary has\r\narisen are admitted on all sides. Mr. Long himself, in words which form\r\nan illuminating commentary on landlordism, confessed that the blessings\r\nand advantages of a change of ownership are obvious. Everyone is agreed\r\nthat the happiness, bred of security on the part of the occupying owner,\r\nbrings in its train sobriety and industry. The business of the gombeen\r\nman is going, and one may well hope to see arise before long that thrift\r\nand energy characteristic of the peasant proprietor, whether in France,\r\nBelgium, or Lombardy.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten, however, that land purchase to bring peace\r\nmust be universal. In 1901 the De Freyne tenants rebelled against the\r\npayment to their landlord of a rent which was 25 to 30 per cent. higher\r\nthan the purchase annuities paid by the neighbouring tenants on the\r\nDillon estate, which had been bought up by the Congested Districts\r\nBoard. Under the Wyndham Act there are in progress reductions of annual\r\ncharges, ranging from 10 to 40 per cent., on holdings adjacent to those\r\nwhere either the landlord is recalcitrant and refuses to sell or where\r\nthe slowness of administration has delayed progress and secured no sale,\r\nand, as a result, dissatisfaction reigns among the less fortunate\r\ntenants.\r\n\r\nAccording to the last report of the Estates Commissioners nearly 90,000\r\nholdings had been sold in the period of the application of the Act, from\r\nNovember 1st, 1903, to March 31st, 1906. The total price of all the\r\nsales agreed upon was nearly forty millions, but the amount advanced by\r\nthe Commission was less than ten millions. There is little doubt that\r\nthe number of agreements for sale would have been half as many again but\r\nfor the lack of money and administrative powers. One of the Estates\r\nCommissioners, in his evidence before the Arterial Drainage Commission,\r\nstated that under the Land Purchase Acts passed before that of 1903 in\r\ntwenty-five years 75,000 tenants had purchased at a price of twenty-five\r\nmillions, and if to these are added the ninety thousand purchasers under\r\nthe Act of Mr. Wyndham the result is seen that nearly a third of the\r\ntenants have in the last quarter of a century become occupying owners.\r\n\r\nThe immense acceleration in the rate of sale which these figures\r\nindicate, leads one to ask how far the sales under the Wyndham Act have\r\nbeen as advantageous to the tenants as those concluded under former\r\nstatutes. In the first place, it must be noted that more than\r\nfour-fifths of the direct sales which have occurred have taken place\r\nunder the zones. When the price proposed is above the zones the reason\r\nwhy inspection is demanded is obviously that the solvency of the\r\npurchaser, with which the State, as creditor, is concerned, is in\r\nquestion. The minimum limit of the zones was said to be necessary to\r\nprotect those with rights superior to those of the landlord, but, as was\r\nobserved, the value of land does not depend on the mortgages with which\r\nit is charged. In view of the modern methods by which, on purchase,\r\nthere is a Treasury guarantee, inspection before sale tends to reduce\r\nthe price, and the absence of inspection under the zones has tended to\r\nenhance prices. It must be further noticed that the minimum price fixed\r\nby the zones is higher than the mean price of sales effected under\r\nPurchase Acts from 1885 to 1903, and by this method in the case of every\r\nsale brought about without the delay of inspection, the provisions of\r\nthe Act have secured an artificial inflation of price for the benefit of\r\nthe landlord, amounting to a minimum of one year's rent. The reduction\r\nof the annuity payable by the tenants from 4 per cent. to 3-1/4 per\r\ncent, of the capital has served to obscure the amount of purchase price\r\npaid by tenants who are apt to fail to appreciate the fact that the\r\nannuity is payable over a more extended period of years, and the\r\nprovisions as to the sale and re-purchase of demesnes have at the same\r\ntime secured for the landlords themselves facilities for obtaining\r\nadvances of ready money on reasonable terms. These are the factors in\r\nthe Wyndham Act which have made M. Paul-Dubois declare of it\r\nthat--\"Emaneé d'un gouvernment, ami des landlords, elle cache mal, sous\r\nun apparence d'impartialité d'adroits efforts pour faire aux landlords\r\nde la part belle pour hausser en leur faveur le prix de la terre.\"\r\n\r\nThe average price per acre for the five years before 1903 was £8 9s.;\r\nsince the Act it has been £13 4s., or taking into account the bonus £15.\r\nThe prices before the Wyndham Act rarely exceeded eighteen years'\r\npurchase, and were, moreover, paid in Land Stock and without a bonus.\r\nUnder this Act the reasons which I have tried to outline have brought it\r\nto pass that twenty-five years of second term rents are being paid in\r\ncash, which, with the bonus, makes the total purchase price amount to\r\ntwenty-eight years. Hence it is that there is widespread anxiety in\r\nIreland lest land is being sold under the zones at prices which the Land\r\nCommission, had it been entitled to inspect, would have been unable to\r\nsanction as offering a safe security, seeing that the purchaser must pay\r\nhis annuity for sixty-eight years without hope of reduction--a danger,\r\nin the event of bad seasons, which might have been diminished if the\r\nsinking fund had been fixed at a higher rate and the decadal reductions\r\nof earlier Acts retained, so as to reduce the incidence of the burden in\r\nits later stages. This, be it noted, is one of the points in which the\r\nprovisions of the Act differ from the recommendations of the Land\r\nConference.\r\n\r\nI have referred already to the block in sales under the Act owing to the\r\nscarcity of money which is forthcoming to meet sales already effected.\r\nBy the financial provisions of the statute, so as not to demoralise the\r\nmarket, a definite check was put upon the issue of the land stock, and\r\njust before the late Government resigned Mr. Long, as Chief Secretary,\r\nmade a proposal, which was not received with enthusiasm by the parties\r\nconcerned, that the landlords should in future be paid partly in stock\r\nat a nominal value and partly in cash. Nothing has since been done, and\r\nthe only step taken so far has been the appointment of a judge in\r\naddition to those formerly so engaged, to accelerate the judicial\r\ninquiries necessitated by the process of transfer. The whole cost of the\r\nfinance of the Act falls on the Irish taxpayer, and before the\r\nintroduction of Mr. Wyndham's proposal the idea was mooted--only to be\r\nabandoned--of reviving a proposal made by Sir Robert Giffen in the\r\n_Economist_ twenty years ago, which would have made the annuities paid\r\non purchase the basis of the funds from which the local bodies in\r\nIreland would draw their revenue, while the Imperial Exchequer would be\r\nrelieved to an equivalent amount by deductions from its grants to local\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nThe cost of the flotation of the Land Stock is borne by the Irish\r\nDevelopment Fund of £185,000 per annum, which is the share of Ireland,\r\nequivalent to the grant for the increased cost of education in England\r\nunder the Act of 1902. More than one-half of this fund has already been\r\nhypothecated for the costs of flotation of the twenty millions of Land\r\nStock which have already been issued, and under the present system of\r\nfinance, after a further issue of another twenty millions of stock, the\r\nwhole loss will be thrown on the County Councils, and through them on\r\nthe ratepayers, who have already been called upon to pay £70,000 to meet\r\ncertain of the losses in this connection, which amount to twelve per\r\ncent. of the value of the stock floated.\r\n\r\nThe breaking up of the grazing lands, which in many instances the\r\nlandlords are keeping back from the market, has not met with much\r\nsuccess under the Act, and it is difficult to see how compulsion is to\r\nbe avoided if the country is to be saved from the economically\r\ndisastrous position of having established in it a number of occupying\r\nowners on tenancies which are not large enough to secure to them a\r\nliving wage.\r\n\r\nUnder the Land Act of 1891 was created the Congested Districts Board,\r\nwith an annual income of £55,000, for the purpose of promoting the\r\npermanent improvement of the backward districts of the West. The\r\ndistricts which come under its control are those which answer the\r\nfollowing test, that more than twenty per cent. of the population of a\r\ncounty live in electoral divisions, of which the total rateable value\r\ngives a sum of less than 30s. per head of population. Such electoral\r\ndivisions occur in the nine counties of Kerry, Cork, Galway, Mayo,\r\nClare, Roscommon, Leitrim, Sligo, Donegal. In these counties there are\r\n1,264 electoral divisions, of which 429 are congested. The setting up of\r\nparticular districts as \"congested\" is, of course, quite arbitrary.\r\nThere may be places outside the congested areas the condition of which\r\nis much worse than that of some of the congested districts, but if the\r\npopulation of these districts does not form one-fifth of that of the\r\nwhole county they are ruled out of the scope of the Board's activities.\r\n\r\nThe conditions which subsist in them have been ably described by M.\r\nBechaux from personal observation, and he declares that the standard of\r\nliving is lower than in any other country of Western Europe. Their\r\ninhabitants number more than half a million--that is to say, 10 per\r\ncent. of the total population of the island. Most of them have farms of\r\ntwo to four acres, and they pay from a few shillings to several pounds\r\nfor rent. In many instances the rent which they pay is rather for a roof\r\nthan for the soil. They eke out a precarious livelihood by migration to\r\nEngland, for there is but little demand for agricultural labour owing to\r\nthe prevalence of pasture in the West. Fishing has served as a secondary\r\nsource of income, and kelp burning was a profitable addition to their\r\nmeans until the discovery of iodine in Peru sent down the price to a\r\nmarked extent.\r\n\r\nThe right of turbary, which nearly every tenancy possesses, is the one\r\nthing which has kept this population from starvation, and in the case of\r\nseaside tenancies a further gain accrues from the use made of seaweed as\r\nmanure, which, owing to the absence of stall-feeding, is only to be\r\nobtained in this way. Home industries, such as weaving, form another\r\nsource of profit, and last, but not least, must be reckoned the money\r\nsent home by relatives who have emigrated to America. Calves, pigs, and\r\npoultry are maintained in these circumstances, and, owing to the sale of\r\nthe best of the stock, the breed has steadily deteriorated. In the\r\nwinter months potatoes, milk, and tea are the main articles of diet, and\r\nafter the potato harvest is used up American meal, ground from maize,\r\nand American bacon of the worst possible kind take their place. The\r\nbacon of their own pigs is far too expensive for them to eat. The maize\r\nflour serves also as fodder for the live stock, and the oats which are\r\ngrown are-eaten as gruel by the people as well as by the animals which\r\nthey rear. The Congested Districts Board was established to remedy, as\r\nfar as possible, this state of things--primarily by reorganising\r\ntenancies and amalgamating them into economic holdings, and at the same\r\ntime enlarging them by the purchase of untenanted land, followed by its\r\naddition to existing tenancies. The slowness of its operations is seen\r\nfrom the fact that after fourteen years it had purchased less than\r\n240,000 acres, of which three-quarters were untenanted land, while the\r\nwhole extent of the congested districts is more than three and a half\r\nmillion acres. In justice to the Board, however, one must add that it\r\nhas concerned itself with many other branches of rural economy--notably\r\nthe improvement of the breed of horses, cattle, and pigs, the sale at\r\ncost price of chemical manures and seed, the making of harbours and\r\nroads, and the sale on instalment terms of fishing boats.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to exaggerate the work done by the Board on the Dillon\r\nestate in Counties Mayo and Roscommon and in Clare Island. But when one\r\nreads in the Report for 1906--the fifteenth annual report of the\r\nBoard--that since its establishment the Board has enlarged 1,220\r\ntenures, re-arranged 537, and created 220, and realises, further, that\r\nthere are in Ireland 200,000 uneconomic holdings, one may well ask what\r\nare these among so many?\r\n\r\nUnder the Act of 1903 the Board's purchases are financed by the Land\r\nCommission, and the results are to be seen in an acceleration of\r\npurchases, for while in the twelve years 1891 to 1903 the Board had\r\nbought about 200,000 acres, of which less than 45,000 were unlet land,\r\nin the three years from November, 1903, to the end of March, 1905, the\r\nacreage bought was over 160,000 acres, of which 48,000 were unlet, and\r\nnegotiations were in progress for the transfer of another 100,000 acres,\r\nof which 20,500 were unlet.\r\n\r\nUnder the Act, however, in the case of \"Congested Estates,\" which are\r\ndefined as those in which one-half at least of the holdings are of\r\nvaluation of £5 or under, or which consist of mountain or bog, the Land\r\nCommission is empowered to purchase and re-sell to the tenants, even at\r\na loss, so long as the total loss on the purchase and improvements of\r\nthese holdings does not exceed 10 per cent. of the cost of the total\r\nsales effected in the course of the same year. The amendments of the\r\nHouse of Lords, however, made the part of the Act dealing with this\r\nquestion a dead letter, and the Land Commissioners have given up the\r\nattempt to put it in force. The landlords, having a choice between sale\r\ndirect to their tenants and to the Land Commission, have refused to give\r\ntheir consent to the declaration of their estate as a congested estate,\r\nwhich is necessary for the application of this section, unless they\r\nreceive a guarantee that the holdings shall not be sold to the tenants\r\nat a lower price than they themselves could have obtained. The result is\r\nthat if the Commissioners were to pay these maximum prices there would\r\nbe nothing left for them out of which to make the necessary\r\nimprovements, and, in consequence, this provision of the Act has been a\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\nAs regards the evicted tenants, the first condition in the settlement\r\narrived at by the Land Conference, and embodied in the Wyndham Act, was\r\nthat they--the wounded soldiers in the land war, as they have been\r\ncalled--to whose sacrifices in the common cause is due the ameliorative\r\nlegislation enacted by Parliament, should be restored to their holdings.\r\nIn actual practice, by means of restrictive instructions issued by the\r\nlate Government to the Commissioners, two of whom protested against this\r\naction in their report for 1906, the provisions of the Act which\r\npromised this reinstatement were made a dead letter--the Executive once\r\nagain, in a historic phrase, driving a coach and four through the\r\nstatute.\r\n\r\nWith the advent to power of the Liberal Government these instructions\r\nwere withdrawn, but a further serious obstacle was to be found in the\r\nrefusal of some landlords--and those, too, the worst--to allow their\r\nestates to be inspected with a view to find holdings for evicted\r\ntenants. This was the condition of affairs to which Mr. Bryce--at that\r\ntime Chief Secretary--referred, when he said--\"If the remedy for this\r\nstate of things is compulsion, then to compulsion for that remedy we\r\nmust go.\"\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed that the three Estates Commissioners were unanimous\r\nin thinking compulsion necessary, and that which was demanded was that\r\nthe occupants, or planters, who in some cases have been _bona fide_\r\nfarmers, but whom the Land Commission inspectors reported had in many\r\ncases allowed the land to get into a bad and dirty state, should, on\r\ndispossession, be generously compensated or given their choice of other\r\nlands. It was originally thought that one thousand would be the limit of\r\nthe number of applications which would be made for reinstatement, but,\r\nin the event, out of ten thousand tenants evicted in the last quarter of\r\na century, such applications were made in 6,700 cases, and some notion\r\nof the poverty of these peasants who were turned out upon the roadside\r\nmay be inferred from the fact that nearly one-half paid a rental of less\r\nthan £10 a year.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the session of 1907, out of the total number of\r\napplicants 1,300 had been rejected as not coming within the scope of the\r\nprovisions relating to them, and 650, or less than 10 per cent. of the\r\nwhole number who applied, had been reinstated. In the case of more than\r\nhalf the total number of applicants no report had been made, and in more\r\nthan 450 cases, including, of course, those on the Clanricarde and Lewis\r\nestates, inspection of the property had been, as it is still, refused by\r\nthe landlords. At this juncture Mr. Birrell declared that further\r\nlegislation was imperatively needed, and to this announcement Mr. Walter\r\nLong replied that he accepted the view of his predecessor, Mr. Wyndham,\r\nas to the bargain which had been come to in regard to this question, and\r\nhe went on to say:--[9]\r\n\r\n\"There can be no doubt whatever that in the interest not merely of these\r\nunfortunate people, whatever their past history may have been, but in\r\nthe interest of the successful working of the Land Purchase Act, their\r\nreinstatement is looked upon as an essential element and a thing\r\npromised by Parliament.\"\r\n\r\nThe voluntary system, to which a tentative agreement was given under the\r\nAct of 1903, having broken down, the Evicted Tenants Bill was designed\r\nas a tardy act of justice to remove the cause for disaffection on the\r\npart of a tenantry to which Mr. T.W. Russell paid a notable tribute the\r\nother day as being not naturally lawless, but in point of fact the most\r\nGod-fearing, purest-minded, and simplest peasantry on the face of the\r\nearth. That his diagnosis, that unrest is merely the product of\r\nsuffering under cruel circumstances, is valid, is illustrated by the\r\ncomplete restoration of peace on the Massereene estate, when, on the\r\ndeath of the late peer, the planters were replaced by the tenants who\r\nhad been evicted.\r\n\r\nThe land which it was proposed to affect by the Bill was a mere matter\r\nof some 80,000 acres, a bagatelle to the landed interest of Ireland, but\r\ninvolving vital consequences to the poverty-stricken peasants of the\r\nWest. It was a Bill, as the Lord Chancellor declared, to deal with the\r\ntail of an agrarian revolution, and to effect this with the minimum of\r\nsuffering, compulsory powers and a simple and expeditious procedure were\r\ndemanded, but in spite of the lip service which Unionists paid to the\r\nprinciples involved, in spite of their admissions that it proposed only\r\nto carry out their part of the agreement, arrived at no less than four\r\nyears ago; by their amendments in the House of Lords, introducing\r\nlimitations and appeals involving delays and costs, they succeeded in\r\nlarge measure in destroying the value of the measure. One can understand\r\nthe attitude of Lord Clanricarde, who roundly denounced the whole\r\nproposal as \"tainted with the callous levity of despotism,\" but it is\r\ndifficult to speak charitably of the members of the Opposition, who,\r\nwhile repeatedly protesting their anxiety to see the evicted tenants\r\nrestored, took care, through the agency of the House of Lords, to place\r\nevery possible obstacle in the way of their speedy re-instatement.\r\n\r\nMany of the amendments designed by the House of Lords were proposed by\r\ntwo of the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, who sit in that House primarily\r\nas judges, and who are supposed to keep free from political\r\nentanglements. They aimed at an enhancement of the prices at which\r\ncompulsory purchase should take effect, with a view, it was admitted by\r\ntheir organs in the Press, to afford a precedent for further schemes of\r\nland purchase at large. Of this nature was the compensation which they\r\ndemanded--fortunately without success--in accordance with the provisions\r\nof the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, which, if accepted by\r\nGovernment, would have given to the landlords on sale a douceur of 10\r\nper cent. in addition to the 12 per cent. bonus which they already enjoy\r\nover and above the market value of the land, and the fixation of such a\r\nprice would have prevented any reinstatement, for this reason, that the\r\ninstalments of the tenants in those circumstances would have been too\r\nhigh to have been within the means of the tenants whom it was proposed\r\nto reinstate.\r\n\r\nThere was a curious irony in the spectacle of the House of Lords\r\nstanding out for the principle of fixity of tenure, and defending tooth\r\nand nail the tenant-right of a few hundred planters, when little more\r\nthan thirty years ago this same body offered the most relentless\r\nopposition to any recognition of the right of compensation for\r\ndisturbance on the part of four millions of Irish tenants. In this\r\nmatter the Lords gained their point, and compulsory powers are not to be\r\napplied under the Act to the holdings on which the landlords have placed\r\nplanters, who are held to be _bona fide_ farmers. An amendment to this\r\neffect was thrown out by the House of Commons, by a majority of more\r\nthan four to one, on a division in which only 66 voted for the\r\namendment, but although the Bill in its original form offered sitting\r\ntenants the fullest compensation ever offered to such persons, and\r\nalthough most of the planters would be only too glad to accept such\r\nterms, the Upper House insisted on over-riding the will of the great\r\nmajority in the Commons.\r\n\r\nLord Lansdowne, on the second reading, gave three reasons why the Bill\r\nshould not be incontinently rejected by the Peers. In the first place,\r\nit came to them, he said, supported by an enormous majority in the other\r\nHouse, \"and their Lordships always desired to treat attentively and\r\nrespectfully Bills which came to them with such a recommendation.\"\r\nSecondly, the late Government, as well as the present, had pledged\r\nthemselves to a measure of reinstatement of some kind, and if they threw\r\nout the Bill on a second reading \"it would be said that they had receded\r\nfrom a kind of understanding arrived at in 1903,\" and lastly, \"the\r\nsummary rejection of the Bill might greatly increase the difficulties of\r\nthe Executive Government in Ireland.\" One would have thought that the\r\nfact that the Bill was given a second reading did little to exonerate\r\nthe Upper House from similar consequences as a result of their\r\nmutilation of the Bill in Committee.\r\n\r\nIn its final form the Act allows an appeal on questions of value from\r\nthe inspector, to two Estates Commissioners, and from them to Mr.\r\nJustice Wylie, sitting as Judicial Commissioner with a valuer. On\r\nquestions of price there is no appeal from him. Other appeals, on\r\nquestions of law and fact, are, by Section 6, to be heard by a Judge of\r\nthe King's Bench, with whom rests the final decision whether a\r\nparticular planter is or is not to be evicted. Demesne lands and other\r\nlands, purchase of which would interfere with the value of adjoining\r\nproperty, are omitted from the scope of the statute, and its operation\r\nis limited to the case of 2,000 tenants, whose claims must be disposed\r\nof within four years. The power vested in the Estates Commissioners\r\ncompulsorily to acquire untenanted land, not necessarily their former\r\nholdings, for the reinstatement of the evicted tenants, is of no\r\npractical value in the case of the Clanricarde estate, since all the\r\nland on it is occupied, and the fact that on that plague-spot--the\r\nnucleus of the whole disturbance--no settlement will be possible under\r\nthe Act, shows to what an extent was justified Mr. Birrell's declaration\r\nthat the final form of the statute was a triumph for Lord Clanricarde,\r\nand affords a curious commentary on the repeated declarations of the\r\nUnionist leaders, that nothing was further from their desire than to\r\neffect the wrecking of the Bill.[10]\r\n\r\nRejection of similar measures of relief--notably the Tenants'\r\nCompensation Bill of 1880--has led in the past to a recrudescence of\r\nstrife in Ireland, and Mr. Balfour's unworthy retort to Mr. Redmond's\r\ndeduction from every precedent in the history of the struggle for the\r\nland, that it was an incitement to lawlessness, was a mere partisan\r\nretort to an avowal of a danger which every unbiassed observer must see\r\narises from the betrayal by the House of Lords of a confidence in a\r\nfinal settlement which was formerly encouraged by a Conservative Govern\r\nmerit.\r\n\r\nOne of the weapons used by the Orangemen in their attack on this Bill\r\nwas to be found in their repeated insinuations as to the unfitness of\r\nthe Estates Commissioners to exercise dispassionately the functions\r\nwhich would be demanded of them. In this the Unionists were hoist with\r\ntheir own petard, for the necessity recognised by the Government for\r\nplacing the Estates Commissioners in a position other than that of mere\r\nExecutive officers, by giving them a judicial tenure independent of\r\nministerial pressure or party influences, was strongly shown by the\r\nincident of the Moore-Bailey correspondence of last session, which\r\nshould provide food for reflection on the part of those who imagine that\r\nintimidation is to be found in Ireland in use only on the National side.\r\nMr. Moore, the most active of the Orangemen, asked in a supplementary\r\nquestion whether it was not a fact that the delay in the Estates\r\nCommissioners' Office was due to Mr. Commissioner Bailey's continued\r\npresence in London. These visits, it should be noted, were paid to\r\nLondon by Mr. Bailey in the discharge of his official duties for the\r\npurpose of consultations with the Government in connection with the\r\nEvicted Tenants Bill. On reading in the papers Mr. Moore's question\r\nimplying negligence to his duties on his part, Mr. Bailey wrote to Mr.\r\nMoore the following letter, marked private:--\r\n\r\n    \"UNIVERSITY CLUB,\r\n\r\n    \"DUBLIN, March, 1907.\r\n\r\n    \"DEAR MOORE,--I see that as a supplemental question you asked\r\n    the other day whether the delay in land purchase was due to the\r\n    continued absence of Mr. Bailey. I do not know, of course, what\r\n    was your object, but it may interest you to know that for the\r\n    last year I attended more days in the office than either of my\r\n    colleagues, and that, as a matter of fact, I did not take much\r\n    more than half the vacation to which I was entitled. You will\r\n    thus see that you have been strangely misinformed, and I can\r\n    only surmise that another of my colleagues was meant.\r\n\r\n    \"Faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n    \"W.F. BAILEY.\"\r\n\r\nTo this Mr. Moore replied:--\r\n\r\n    \"ULSTER CLUB,\r\n\r\n    \"BELFAST, March 19th.\r\n\r\n    \"DEAR BAILEY,--You were appointed by a Unionist Government to\r\n    see fair play between Wrench and Finucane, and you have sold\r\n    the pass on every occasion. The first thing my colleagues and I\r\n    will do when we come back, which will not be very far off, will\r\n    be to press for an inquiry into the working of your department.\r\n    You can destroy your evidence now, and show this to whom you\r\n    please.\r\n\r\n    \"Yours truly,\r\n\r\n    \"W. MOORE.\"\r\n\r\nIn reply the Estates Commissioner wrote:--\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Bailey desires to acknowledge receipt of Mr. Moore's\r\n    letter of the 19th inst., and inasmuch as it contains grave\r\n    statements of a threatening and unfounded character he will\r\n    take an early opportunity of bringing the matter under notice\r\n    in the proper quarter.\"\r\n\r\nThe final letter was Mr. Moore's reply:--\r\n\r\n    \"ULSTER CLUB,\r\n\r\n    \"BELFAST, March 25th.\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Moore hopes that when Mr. Bailey publishes the\r\n    correspondence he will make it clear that Mr. Moore's reply was\r\n    directed to a disloyal attack by Mr. Bailey on one of his\r\n    colleagues in his letter to Mr. Moore. This is all that was\r\n    omitted from Mr. Moore's reply.\"\r\n\r\nThe next step in this discreditable incident occurred on July 23rd, on\r\nwhich day Mr. Moore denounced Mr. Bailey in the House of Commons for his\r\npartisanship towards the Nationalists, and gave a graphic picture of the\r\nprivate letter which Mr. Bailey had written to him to protest against\r\nhis personal attacks. Mr. Redmond rose and asked that Mr. Russell should\r\nread to the House Mr. Moore's reply, and Mr. Russell thereupon read the\r\nsecond of the letters given above, upon which Mr. Balfour, regardless of\r\nhis own share in the partial suppression of the Wyndham-MacDonnell\r\n_dossier_ a few years before, demanded the production of the whole\r\ncorrespondence. This was done on July 26th, when Mr. Moore read the\r\nletters in the order given above. In his personal explanation he\r\nrepresented it as an extremely suspicious circumstance that Mr. Bailey\r\nhad been seen in the Lobby in conversation with the Nationalists. \"That\r\nmay be legitimate,\" he said, \"but I think it very undesirable,\" and in\r\nthe very next breath he confessed that another of the Commissioners was\r\na particular and personal friend of his own, to whom he would have shown\r\nthe first letter from Mr. Bailey if it had not been marked private.\r\n\r\nThe comment of the _Times_--in which Mr. Moore as a rule finds an active\r\nadmirer of his political methods--is interesting:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Bailey is a public servant entrusted with certain quasi-judicial\r\nfunctions. That a member of Parliament, whatever may be his opinions of\r\nthe conduct of such an official, should inform him that he had been\r\nappointed 'to see fair play' between his colleagues, and that he had not\r\nseen it, and should couple this charge with a promise to press for an\r\ninquiry into the working of the department whenever there should be a\r\nchange of Government, is indefensible.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole incident is worthy of attention as showing the atmosphere of\r\nsuspicious hostility with which the Orange faction in Ireland surrounds\r\nevery act even of Civil Servants and Executive Officers who are not as\r\nactive supporters of the ascendancy as they would wish.\r\n\r\nOf further legislation dealing with the laws of tenure, the Town Tenants\r\nAct of 1906, which Mr. Balfour denounced as highway robbery, gives\r\ntenants in towns compensation for disturbance so as to prevent a\r\nlandlord making a vexatious use of his rights. An attempt was made by\r\nthe House of Lords to limit the compensation so paid to one year's rent,\r\nbut the rejection of the amendment by the House of Commons was\r\nacquiesced in, and no such limitation exists in the Act.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the question of the agricultural labourers, the fact that\r\nthe last Census Report discloses that there are in Ireland nearly 10,000\r\n\"houses\" with one room and one window apiece, wretched cabins inhabited\r\nby about 40,000 people, the peat smoke from the fire in which escapes\r\nthrough a hole in the thatch, gives some idea of the miserable\r\nconditions existing in parts of the West of Ireland. Of the quarter of a\r\nmillion of cottages in the second class of the Census--those, that is,\r\nwith from one to four doors and windows--a large number also no doubt\r\nare quite unfit for habitation, and do much in the way of leading to the\r\nasylum or to emigration. It is to secure the replacement of these by\r\ncheap sanitary and comfortable cottages that the Labourers' Acts, ever\r\nsince the first of the series introduced by the Irish Party in 1883,\r\nhave been passed. By them Boards of Guardians, and by the Local\r\nGovernment Act, Rural District Councils, may build such cottages. In\r\n1905, 18,000 cottages had been built under existing Acts, and they are\r\nlet to tenants at rents of from 10d. to 1s. a week, but the difficulty\r\nhad always been to effect the improvements sufficiently rapidly owing to\r\nthe costly and elaborate procedure which involved an appeal to the Privy\r\nCouncil and a heavy burden on the rates of a poverty-stricken community.\r\nThe Act of 1906 has simplified procedure by replacing the appeal to the\r\nPrivy Council by an appeal to the Local Government Board, and that it\r\nwas needful is seen from the fact that under Wyndham's Act only 25\r\ncottages were built. It is hoped thereby to circumvent the apathy of\r\nDistrict Councils, and their parsimony is to be appeased by the fact\r\nthat the funds, which are largely derived from economics in the Irish\r\nExecutive are advanced at a rate of interest, not as heretofore of 4-7/8\r\nper cent., but, as in the case of land purchase advances, of 3-1/4 per\r\ncent., repayable in a period of 68-1/2 years. The urgency of the problem\r\nis obvious. The bearing of this state of affairs in rural housing on the\r\nfact that in 1904 two out of every thirteen deaths were due to\r\ntuberculosis shows that it is impossible to overestimate its importance,\r\nand I think that this condition of things, put side by side with the\r\nother economic facts with which I have dealt, are a sufficient reply to\r\nthose who declare that conditions in Ireland would appear _couleur de\r\nrose_ were they not seen through the jaundiced eyes of a discontented\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nIf the catalogue of Acts of Parliament which have been found necessary\r\nto effect the transformation of the system of tenure in Ireland from the\r\nstate in which it was forty years ago to that in which it is to-day is\r\nevidence of the pressing grievance under which the country has suffered;\r\nit is also proof that there cannot be legislation other than by shreds\r\nand patches on the part of a legislature which lacks sympathy for and\r\nknowledge of the country for which it is making laws.\r\n\r\nThe need for exceptional and separate legislation in Ireland has been\r\nadmitted, and the system which existed in fact, obtained legal sanction\r\nonly in 1881, to be in its turn swept away by further legislation which\r\nwill have a deeper economic bearing on the future of the country than\r\nany other change since the relaxation of the Penal Laws. For the rest I\r\ncannot do better than quote, in this connection, the opinion of the most\r\ndispassionate critic of Ireland of recent years--Herr Moritz Bonn.\r\nSpeaking of the landlord who has sold his estate he says--\"He has no\r\nfurther cause of friction with his former tenants, who now pay him no\r\nrent. He no longer regards himself as part of an English garrison. He\r\nwill again become an Irish patriot. He no longer talks of the unity of\r\nthe Empire, for Home Rule has few terrors for him now. He talks of\r\n'Devolution,' of the concession of a kind of self-government for\r\nIreland. He will struggle for a while against the designation Home Rule,\r\nbecause not so long ago he was declaring that he would die in the last\r\nditch for the union of the three kingdoms, but he will soon be\r\nreconciled to it. It will not be very long till the former landlords,\r\nwhose chief interests lie in Ireland, have become enthusiastic\r\nNationalists.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE RELIGIOUS QUESTION\r\n\r\n     \"I am convinced that if the void in the lay leadership of the\r\n     country be filled up by higher education of the better classes\r\n     among the Catholic laity, the power of the priests, so far as\r\n     it is abnormal or unnecessary, will pass away.\"\r\n\r\n     --DR. O'DEA, now Bishop of Clonfert, speaking in evidence\r\n     before the Robertson Commission on University Education, as\r\n     the representative of Maynooth College. Appendix to Third\r\n     Report, p. 296.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe scruples of George III., who although as King of Ireland he yielded\r\nto the claims of Catholics to the suffrage by giving the Royal consent\r\nto the enfranchising Act of Grattan's Parliament in 1793, were such that\r\nthey made him declare that his coronation oath compelled him to maintain\r\nthe Protestantism of the United Parliament of the three kingdoms and\r\nexpress himself to Dundas of opinion that Pitt's emancipation proposals\r\nwere \"the most Jacobinical thing ever seen.\"\r\n\r\nThe continuance for thirty years of these political disabilities, and\r\nthe obligation incumbent on Catholics to support an alien Church with\r\nthe full weight of endowments and tithes, did more than anything else to\r\nmaintain the wall of prejudice between the two creeds which the eighteen\r\nyears of Grattan's Parliament had done much to destroy.\r\n\r\nIt was James Anthony Froude who said that the absenteeism of her men of\r\ngenius was a worse wrong to Ireland than the absenteeism of her\r\nlandlords. This evil the Union accentuated by reducing Dublin from the\r\nseat of Government, which in the middle of the eighteenth century had\r\nbeen the second only to London in size and importance, to the status of\r\na provincial city from which were drawn the leaders of that liberal\r\nschool of Protestantism the rise of which was the marked feature of\r\nIrish politics at the end of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe dividing line between parties in England has never been one of caste\r\nor of creed, still less of both combined. In the past the Whigs could\r\nclaim as aristocratic and as exclusive a prestige as could the Tories.\r\nIn point of wealth there was little to choose, and, most important of\r\nall, in respect of religion, though the minor clergy were very largely\r\nTory and the Dissenters were allied to the Whigs, yet the Anglicanism of\r\nthe great Whig families, and their appointments when in power to the\r\nEpiscopal bench and to other places of preferment, saved the Church of\r\nEngland from being identified _in toto_ with either party in the State.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland, unfortunately, the case was far different, for there\r\nproperty and the Established Church found themselves ranged side by side\r\nin the maintenance of their respective privileges against the democracy,\r\nwhich, as it happened, was Catholic, and which for many years after the\r\nUnion did not recover from the long and demoralising persecution of the\r\nPenal Laws.\r\n\r\nThe aristocracy resisted emancipation, in spite of the fact that it was\r\nadvocated by all the greatest statesmen and orators of two generations,\r\nand it did so quite as much because it was emancipation of the masses as\r\nbecause it was emancipation of the Catholics. The Church of Ireland at\r\nthe same time dreaded the reform since it had the foresight to perceive\r\nthat the outcome would be an attack upon her prerogatives and an assault\r\nupon her position. The anticipations of both were well founded. Nine\r\nyears after the Emancipation Act, tithe, which an English Prime Minister\r\nhad declared was as sacred as rent, was by Act of Parliament commuted\r\ninto a rent-charge no longer collected directly from the tenant, but\r\npaid by the landlord, who, however, compensated himself for its\r\nincidence on his shoulders by raising rents. Forty years later the\r\nChurch Act was passed, and almost simultaneously was begun the assault\r\non the land system which had given support to, and received it from, the\r\nChurch Establishment.\r\n\r\nI have heard it said by Englishmen who have watched the course of\r\npolitics for some years that the jingling watchword which Lord Randolph\r\nChurchill coined for the Unionists twenty years ago, that Home Rule\r\nwould spell Rome Rule, if used again to-day would to a very great extent\r\nfall flat. They have based this view, not on the assumption that\r\nEnglishmen love Rome more, but rather upon the opinion that they care\r\nfor all religions less, and that hence the appeal to bigotry would make\r\nless play.\r\n\r\nThe fact, however, remains that one meets men in England with every\r\nsympathy for Irish claims who shrink nevertheless from the advocacy of\r\nthe principle of self-government through fear lest the Protestant\r\nminority should suffer. This fear for the rights of minorities serves\r\nalways as the last ditch in which a losing cause entrenches itself, and\r\ntimid souls have always been found who hesitate at the approach of every\r\nreform on the ground that the devil you know may turn out to be not so\r\nbad as the devil you do not know. The legislative history of the House\r\nof Lords during the last century, if examples of this were needed, would\r\nprovide them in large numbers; and as to the question of whether it is\r\nbetter that the majority or the minority of a nation should be governed\r\nagainst its will, one need scarcely say which is the principle adopted\r\nin a normal system of Parliamentary government. The rapidity with which\r\nunder Grattan's Parliament an emancipated Ireland ceased to be\r\nintolerant leads one to suspect that the bigotry of creeds which is\r\nattributed to us as a race is not a natural characteristic, but rather\r\nthe outcome of external causes. This view is borne out by the opinion\r\nof Lecky, who declared that the deliberate policy of English statesmen\r\nwas \"to dig a deep chasm between Catholics and Protestants,\" and if\r\nproof of the allegation is needed it is to be found in the fact that in\r\nthe middle of the eighteenth century the Protestant Primate, Archbishop\r\nBoulter, wrote to Government concerning a certain proposal that \"it\r\nunited Protestants and Papists, and if that conciliation takes place,\r\nfarewell to English influence in Ireland.\"\r\n\r\nUnder Grattan's Parliament Trinity College, Dublin, opened its doors,\r\nthough not its endowments, to Catholics. In 1795 a petition from\r\nMaynooth, the lay college in which was not till twenty years later\r\nsuppressed by Government for political reasons, was presented to the\r\nIrish House of Commons by Henry Grattan, protesting against the\r\nexclusion of Protestants from its halls. In the ranks of the Volunteers,\r\nwho secured free trade in 1779 and Parliamentary Independence in 1782,\r\nCatholics and Protestants stood shoulder to shoulder, and the\r\nindependent legislature, which was the outcome of their efforts, granted\r\nthe franchise to the Catholics.\r\n\r\nIt was of course natural, when Catholics were excluded from Parliament,\r\nthat the leaders of the people should have been members of the\r\nProtestant Church, but in view of the alleged bigotry at the present day\r\nof the mass of the Irish people it is surely significant that Isaac Butt\r\nand Parnell were both members of the Church of minority, that to take\r\nthree of the fiercest opponents of the maintenance of the Union John\r\nMitchell was a Unitarian, Thomas Davis an Episcopalian Protestant, and\r\nJoseph Biggar a Presbyterian. At this moment of the Nationalist Members\r\nof Parliament nine, or more than ten per cent., are Protestants, and one\r\nmay well ask if the Orangemen have ever had a like proportion of\r\nCatholic members of their party, and _à fortiori_ what would be thought\r\nof the suggestion that a member of that religion should lead them in\r\nthe House of Commons. The difficulty experienced in Great Britain by\r\nwould-be candidates of either party in securing their adoption by local\r\nassociations if they are Catholics is so common as to make the excessive\r\nbigotry alleged against the Irish Catholics, one-tenth of whose\r\nrepresentatives are Protestants, appear very much exaggerated.\r\n\r\nThat bigotry exists among Catholics to some extent I should be the last,\r\nalbeit regretfully, to deny, but I leave it to the reader to judge how\r\nfar this is the result and the natural outcome of a policy the direct\r\nopposite of that pursued in Scotland, where shortly after the union of\r\nher Parliament with that of England, the Church of the majority of the\r\npeople was for the sake of peace established and has remained in this\r\nprivileged position ever since. In view of the use to which the \"No\r\nPopery\" cry has been put in its bearings on the Irish question, it is\r\ninteresting to consider the relations of the English Government with the\r\nCatholic Church throughout the last century and to see how far it throws\r\nlight on the justice and applicability of the taunt that Ireland is\r\npriest-ridden.\r\n\r\nIn 1814 the Catholics of England, in spite of the opposition of the\r\nIrish people, secured from Mgr. Quarantotti, the Vice-Prefect of the\r\nPropaganda in Rome, who was acting in the absence of Pope Pius VII., at\r\nthat date still a prisoner in France, a letter declaring that in his\r\njudgment the Royal veto should be exercised on ecclesiastical\r\nappointments in Ireland. Under O'Connell's leadership, the bishops,\r\nclergy, and people of Ireland refused to submit to the decree, and\r\nthere, in spite of the indignation of the English Catholics as a whole\r\nand of the Catholic aristocracy of Ireland, the proposal was allowed to\r\ndrop, which would have virtually given a right of _congé d'elire_ to the\r\nEnglish ministry.\r\n\r\nIn 1782 Edmund Burke had written in his letter to a peer of Ireland on\r\nthe Penal Laws--\"Never were the members of a religious sect fit to\r\nappoint the pastors of another. It is a good deal to suppose that even\r\nthe present Castle would nominate bishops for the Irish Catholic Church\r\nwith a religious regard for its welfare.\" If this was the case under\r\nGrattan's Parliament, its application thirty years later was very much\r\nmore cogent. Behind the scenes, however, the wires continued to be\r\npulled, as is seen by what Melbourne told Greville in 1835, after the\r\nlatter had expressed the opinion that the sound course in Irish affairs\r\nwas to open a negotiation with Rome.[11] \"He then told me ... that an\r\napplication had been made to the Pope very lately (through Seymour)\r\nexpressive of the particular wish of the British Government that he\r\nwould not appoint MacHale to the vacant bishopric--anyone but him. But\r\non this occasion the Pope made a shrewd observation. His Holiness said\r\nthat he had remarked that no place of preferment of any value ever fell\r\nvacant in Ireland that he did not get an application from the British\r\nGovernment asking for the appointment. Lord Melbourne supposed that he\r\nwas determined to show that he had the power of refusal and of opposing\r\nthe wishes of the Government, and in reply to my questions he admitted\r\nthat the Pope had generally conferred the appointment according to the\r\nwishes of the Government.\"\r\n\r\nThese facts must be borne in mind on the part of those by whom the\r\nadmitted support given by the Whig Catholic \"Castle Bishops\" of the\r\nearly part of the nineteenth century to the Government is urged as\r\nevidence of a consistent tendency on the part of the Church in Ireland,\r\nthe political views of the prelates of which, so soon as in the second\r\nhalf of the nineteenth century Governmental lobbying ceased, were of an\r\nentirely different colour.\r\n\r\nAt a later date Greville returned to the topic and noted that[12]\r\n\"Palmerston said there was nothing to prevent our sending a minister to\r\nRome; but they had not dared to do it on account of their supposed\r\nPopish tendencies. Peel might.\"  Melbourne was not alone among Prime\r\nMinisters of the time in his appeals to the Holy See. In 1844 the\r\nGovernment of Sir Robert Peel, when troubled with the manifestations of\r\nsympathy which O'Connell was arousing, made an appeal to Gregory XVI. to\r\ndiscourage the agitation, and three years later, when the Whigs under\r\nLord John Russell were in office, Lord Minto, Lord Privy Seal, who was\r\nPalmerston's father-in-law, was sent to Rome in the autumn recess to\r\nsecure the adherence of Pius IX., then in the first months of his\r\nPontificate, to the same line of action, and to bring to the notice of\r\nHis Holiness the conduct of the Irish priesthood in supporting\r\nO'Connell. The fact that neither Gregory XVI. nor Pio Nono made any\r\nresponse to these appeals lends point to the sardonic comment of\r\nDisraeli on the Minto mission--that he had gone to teach diplomacy to\r\nthe countrymen of Machiavelli. The views of Palmerston, on the other\r\nhand, are to be seen from a letter addressed to Minto, which is extant,\r\nin which, with characteristic bluntness, the Foreign Secretary wrote\r\nthat public opinion against the Irish priests at home was so exasperated\r\nthat nothing would give English people more satisfaction than to see a\r\nfew of them hanged.\r\n\r\n\"Can anything be more absurd,\" Greville had written concerning the\r\nrelations which Melbourne revealed to him as subsisting between Downing\r\nStreet and the Vatican, and the quotation is as appropriate to these\r\nlater overtures. \"Can anything be more absurd or anomalous than such\r\nrelations as these? The law prohibits any intercourse with Rome, and the\r\nGovernment, whose business it is to enforce the law, establishes a\r\nregular, but underhand, intercourse through the medium of a diplomatic\r\nagent, whose character cannot be avowed, and the ministers of this\r\nProtestant kingdom are continually soliciting the Pope to confer\r\nappointments, the validity, even the existence, of which they do not\r\nrecognise, while the Pope, who is the chief object of our abhorrence and\r\ndread, good humouredly complies with all or nearly all their requests.\"\r\n\r\nTwo years after the Minto mission, and a few months before he succeeded\r\nto power in place of Peel, Lord John Russell told Charles Greville that\r\nthe Government was \"the greatest curse to Ireland,\" and he spoke of\r\n\"their policy of first truckling to the Orangemen, insulting, and then\r\nmaking useless concessions to the Catholics, without firmness and\r\njustice.\"[13] It is only fair to Lord John to say that in the following\r\nyear he ordered a Bill to be drawn up to legalise intercourse with the\r\nPope and to put an end to these repeated acts of _præmunire_ on the part\r\nof Ministers of the Crown; for a large number of constitutional\r\nauthorities believed that their action amounted to this offence, which\r\nhas been defined as consisting of acts tending to introduce into the\r\nrealm some foreign power, more particularly that of the Pope, to the\r\ndiminution of the King's authority.\r\n\r\nThe Diplomatic Relations with the Court of Rome Bill was introduced and\r\npassed into law, with one important amendment which we shall have\r\noccasion to notice later, in 1848, less than two years after Peel's\r\nministry had been succeeded by that of Russell. The grounds upon which\r\nits acceptance by Parliament was demanded were that the complications\r\nresulting from the revolutionary crisis throughout the Continent made it\r\nessential that the Foreign Office should be in a position, in dealing\r\nwith the chancelleries of Europe, to obtain direct recognition, and as a\r\nresult first-hand information, as to the attitude of the Holy See in any\r\nsituations which might arise; and the acceptance by Parliament of the\r\nchange of policy which the Bill was intended to effect, on the\r\nunderstanding that diplomatic negotiations should be confined to foreign\r\naffairs, may be seen in the words of Earl Fitzwilliam in the House of\r\nLords. In his speech in support of the Bill he declared that \"the very\r\nlast subject upon which the Government should communicate with the\r\nCourt of Rome was that which had reference to relations which it should\r\nhave with its own Roman Catholic subjects.\"[14]\r\n\r\nThe Act was an enabling Act, and its proposals, like those as to\r\nconcurrent endowment which Russell had made three years earlier, were\r\nforgotten in 1850, when, in the matter of the Ecclesiastical Titles\r\nBill, the Prime Minister played the part which Leech immortalised as\r\nthat of \"the little boy who chalked up 'No Popery' and then ran away.\"\r\n\r\nEven in the interval before this occurred the provisions of the Act were\r\nnot put in force. No appointment pursuant to the statute was ever made,\r\nbut its object was indirectly secured by the fact that a Secretary of\r\nLegation, nominally accredited to the Court of the Grand Duke of\r\nTuscany, was kept in residence in Rome, where he served as a _de facto_\r\nMinister to the Vatican. This state of affairs was maintained until Lord\r\nDerby recalled Jervoise, who was then Secretary, from Rome, and from\r\nthat date even this measure of diplomatic representation at the Vatican\r\nhas ceased to exist.\r\n\r\nThe Bill of 1848, as we have seen, was directed to the establishment of\r\nrelations with \"the Court of Rome.\" An amendment on the part of the\r\nBishop of Winchester, which was accepted and passed into law,\r\nsubstituted for these words the phrase \"Sovereign of the Roman States,\"\r\nand in consequence, after the loss of the Temporal Power, the Act was\r\nrepealed by the Statute Law Revision Act, 1875, so that the law was\r\nrestored to that condition, in regard to this subject, in which it had\r\nbeen before Lord John Russell introduced the Act of 1848.\r\n\r\nAll this, it will be said, is ancient history, but the fact that it is\r\nfifty years old does not affect my point, which is this--that the\r\nmaintenance of an unnatural polity can only be secured by means of a\r\nseries of subterfuges such as these employed by Unionist Governments,\r\nboth Whig and Tory, by which, while sympathy was extended to Orangemen\r\nin the open, the Ministry endeavoured to twitch the red sleeves of the\r\nRoman Curia in the back stairs of the Vatican.\r\n\r\nAs Macaulay picturesquely put it, at any moment Exeter Hall might raise\r\nits war whoop and the Orangemen would begin to bray, and there was no\r\nchoice, one must suppose, but that you should not let your right hand\r\nknow what your left hand was doing.\r\n\r\nIn 1881 Mr. Gladstone appealed to Cardinal Newman to apprise the Pope of\r\nthe violent speeches which were being delivered by certain priests in\r\nIreland, for whose language he said he held the Pope, if informed of it,\r\nmorally responsible, and he asked the English Cardinal for his\r\nassistance. To this Newman replied that the Pope was not supreme in\r\npolitical matters, his action as to whether a political party is\r\ncensurable is not direct, and, moreover, it lay with the bishops to\r\ncensure the clergy for their language if they thought it intemperate,\r\nand the interposition of the Holy See was not called for by the\r\ncircumstances of the case.\r\n\r\nThe policy, however, which had been applied before was employed once\r\nmore in another direction in the teeth of British sentiment if not of\r\nBritish law. A mortgage had been foreclosed on Parnell's estate, and the\r\nIrish newspapers having obtained knowledge of the fact raised a\r\ncollection which became known as the Parnell Tribute, and which was\r\nheaded by a subscription from the Archbishop of Cashel. If precedent\r\nwere needed for this form of recognition of national services it was to\r\nbe found in the grant of £50,000--which might, had he been willing, have\r\nbeen double that amount--which was made to Grattan by the emancipated\r\nIrish House of Commons, but more exact parallels perhaps are to be found\r\nin \"O'Connel's Rent,\" which Greville described as \"nobly paid and nobly\r\nearned,\" or in the great collection which marked the popular\r\nappreciation in Great Britain of Cobden's services in securing the\r\nrepeal of the Corn Laws. In the autumn of 1881, when the Parnell\r\nTribute was initiated, the Land League agitation was in full swing in\r\nIreland, and about the same time Mr. George Errington, an English\r\nCatholic Whig Member of Parliament, who was about to spend the winter in\r\nRome, called on Lord Granville, the Foreign Secretary, and was given by\r\nhim an introduction to the Cardinal Secretary of State. In this wise Mr.\r\nErrington went, in the phrase of the day, \"to keep the Vatican in good\r\nhumour,\" and if he was not the accredited representative of Her\r\nBrittanic Majesty--for that would have been illegal--at any rate he went\r\nwith the sanction and under the ægis of the Foreign Office.\r\n\r\nThe upshot was a Papal rescript, signed by Cardinal Simeoni, the\r\nPrefect, and Mgr. Jacobini, the Secretary of the Sacred Congregation De\r\nPropagatione Fide, which condemned the Tribute owing to the Land League\r\nagitation.\r\n\r\n\"The collection called 'The Parnell Testimonial Fund,'\" so ran the\r\nrescript, \"cannot be approved, and consequently it cannot be tolerated\r\nthat any ecclesiastic, much less a bishop, should take any part whatever\r\nin recommending or promoting it.\"\r\n\r\nThe bishops and clergy withdrew from any further action in connection\r\nwith the Tribute Fund, but the laity gave the lie to the suggestion that\r\nthey are under the thumb of their priests in matters which are not\r\nwithin the sphere of faith or morals. The rescript was promulgated in\r\nMay, and at this time the subscription list amounted to less than\r\n£8,000. Within a month it had doubled, and by the end of the year it\r\namounted to £37,000. The amount of the mortgage was £13,000. As Parnell,\r\nin a characteristically laconic way, put it in his evidence before the\r\nCommission, \"The Irish people raised a collection for me to pay off the\r\namount of a mortgage. The amount of the collection considerably exceeded\r\nthe amount necessary.\" The retort of the country to the document\r\n\"_Qualecumque de Parnellio_,\" had been, in the phrase then current, to\r\n\"make Peter's pence into Parnell's pounds.\"\r\n\r\nTwo years after the Simeoni letter Mr. Errington was again in Rome,\r\nattempting this time to secure the exclusion from the successorship to\r\nCardinal M'Cabe, of Dr. Walsh of Maynooth, as Archbishop of Dublin. A\r\nletter on the subject fell into the hands of the editor of _United\r\nIreland_, who published it in his paper, and so in this way thwarted the\r\nobjects of the second Errington mission. \"If we want to hold Ireland by\r\nforce,\" said Joseph Cowen, the Radical member for Newcastle, \"let us do\r\nit ourselves; let us not call in the Pope, whom we are always attacking,\r\nto help us.\"\r\n\r\nA further instance may be recounted of the manner in which the people of\r\nwhat is, after Spain, the most Catholic country in Europe, while\r\nsubmitting to the Pope implicitly in matters which are _de fide_,\r\nrefused to take their cue in purely political matters from Rome.\r\n\r\nThe rejection of the Home Rule Bill and of the Land Bill of 1886, and\r\nthe return of the Conservatives to power, led to a recrudescence of the\r\nland war, to which the hope of ameliorative legislation had temporarily\r\nput a truce. The Plan of Campaign, which was then launched--of which it\r\nhas been said that no agrarian movement was ever so unstained by\r\ncrime--was of the following nature:--The tenants of a locality were to\r\nform themselves into an association, each member of which was to proffer\r\nto the landlord or his agent a sum which was estimated by the general\r\nbody as a fair rent for his holding. These sums, if refused by the\r\nlandlord, were pooled and divided by the association for the maintenance\r\nof those tenants who were evicted.\r\n\r\nThe wheels were set in motion in Rome to obtain a ruling from the Holy\r\nOffice as to whether such action was justifiable or not. Mgr. Persico,\r\nthe head of the Oriental rite in the Propaganda, who had had much\r\nexperience of English speaking people in the East, was sent to Ireland\r\nin July, 1887, to investigate the question on the spot. In April, 1888,\r\na rescript was issued by the Holy Office to the bishops of Ireland\r\ncondemning the Plan of Campaign and boycotting on the ground that they\r\nwere contrary to both natural justice and Christian charity. With the\r\nDecree was sent to the bishops a circular letter, signed by Cardinal\r\nMonaco, the Secretary of the Holy Office, which contained the following\r\nstatement:--\"The justice of the decision will be readily seen by anyone\r\nwho applies his mind to consider that a rent agreed upon by mutual\r\nconsent cannot, without violation of a contract, be diminished at the\r\nmere will of a tenant, especially when there are tribunals appointed for\r\nsettling such controversies and reducing unjust rents within the bounds\r\nof equity after taking into account the causes which diminish the value\r\nof the land.... Finally, it is contrary to justice and to charity to\r\npersecute by a social interdict those who are satisfied to pay rents\r\nagreed upon, or those who, in the exercise of their right, take vacant\r\nlands.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Tablet_, the organ of English Catholicism, speaking of the\r\ndecision, said that happily there was no suspicion of politics about it,\r\nand as to the letter of Cardinal Monaco la Valetta, it wrote--\"It adds\r\ncertain reasons which perhaps may have led the Congregation to answer as\r\nthey have done, but these constitute no part of the official reply.\" The\r\nnext step in this episode should be well pondered by those who accuse\r\nthe Irish of a blind Ultramontanism. The bishops, with one exception,\r\nomitted to publish the rescript to their flocks, and the Archbishop of\r\nCashel went so far as to send £50 to the funds of the Plan of Campaign.\r\nParnell, referring publicly to the rescript as \"a document from a\r\ndistant country,\" declared that his Catholic colleagues must decide for\r\nthemselves what action to take. Mr. Dillon contradicted the statements\r\nin Cardinal Monaco's letter to the effect that the contracts were\r\nvoluntary or that the campaign fund of the Land League had been\r\ncollected by extortion. A meeting of forty Catholic members of\r\nParliament assembled in Dublin, and in the Mansion House in that city\r\nsigned a document denying the allegations about free contracts, fair\r\nrent, the Land Commission, and the rest, declared that the conclusions\r\nhad been drawn from erroneous premises, and while asserting their\r\ncomplete obedience to the Holy See in spiritual matters, no less\r\nstrongly repudiated the suggestion that Rome had any right to interfere\r\nin matters of a political nature. Mass meetings were held in the Phoenix\r\nPark in Dublin, and in Cork, which indorsed this position by popular\r\nvote. The Orangemen were delighted at the imminence of a schism, and the\r\ndiscomfiture of the Catholics under a decree, the result of internal\r\ndivision, was hailed with pleasure only by the enemies of the Church. In\r\nthe event they were doomed to disappointment, for in the closing days of\r\nthe year the Holy Father wrote a letter to the Archbishop of Dublin\r\nconcerning his action, which had been \"so sadly misunderstood,\" in which\r\nhe wrote that \"as to the counsels that we have given to the people of\r\nIreland from time to time and our recent decree, we were moved in these\r\nthings, not only by the consideration of what is conformable to truth\r\nand justice, but also by the desire of advancing your interests. For\r\nsuch is our affection for you that it does not suffer us to allow the\r\ncause in which Ireland is struggling to be weakened by the introduction\r\nof anything that could justly be brought in reproach against it.\"\r\n\r\nIn this manner was closed an incident which was expected by its foes to\r\nthreaten the allegiance of Ireland, and with it that of more than half\r\nthe Catholics in England, to the Holy See.\r\n\r\nThe Nationalist members at the Mansion House had flatly declared that\r\nthe decree was an instrument of the unscrupulous enemies both of Ireland\r\nand of the Holy See. The _Tablet_, which declared that it had been\r\npromulgated with full and intimate knowledge of all the circumstances,\r\nretorted--\"As a matter of fact we believe that the English Government\r\nhas taken no steps, direct or indirect, to obtain the pronouncement,\r\nwhich is based solely on the reports of Mgr. Persico and the documents\r\nand evidence which accompanied them.\" And it went on to add that Persico\r\nwas expected to return to Ireland to watch the application of the\r\ndecree.\r\n\r\nBeyond this, until recently, nothing more was known except that it was\r\nremarked that negotiations between the Duke of Norfolk and the Vatican\r\nwere broken off, and that the former left Rome suddenly for England\r\nwithout having an audience with the Pope, for which arrangements had\r\nbeen made. The forecast of the _Tablet_ as to Mgr. Persico's return to\r\nIreland to see that the terms of the decree were enforced and applied,\r\nwas not correct. The responsibility for the decree was everywhere laid\r\non his shoulders, and the _Tablet_ for April 27th, 1889, records that an\r\nAddress was presented to Mgr. Persico after his return to Rome \"as an\r\nexpression of respect, and in the fervent hope that his Excellency's\r\nmission might largely conduce to the glory of God, the increase of\r\ncharity, and the restoration of peace and goodwill among men.\"\r\n\r\nIt is only in the last couple of years, with the publications of\r\nPersico's correspondence with Cardinal Manning,[15] that the real facts\r\nof the case have been known. After spending six months in Ireland, the\r\nenvoy was obliged, for reasons of health, to move to Devonshire in\r\nJanuary, 1888. He had orders from Rome to remain in the British Islands,\r\nbut further, so he told the Cardinal in his letter, \"I must not reside\r\nin London so as to give not the least suspicion that I have anything to\r\ndo with the British Government.\" As to the promulgation of the decree,\r\nit was done without his knowledge and, what is more, against his\r\njudgment. Having arrived in Ireland in July, 1887, he had concluded his\r\ninvestigations by the middle of the month of December of that year. His\r\nrequests that the mission might be terminated were met by the reply that\r\nit was to continue indefinitely, and he was told that if he wished, for\r\nreasons of health, to leave Ireland during the winter months he might do\r\nso, but that he must remain in the British Isles.\r\n\r\nAfter the issue of the rescript he wrote to the English Cardinal in\r\nthese words:--\"It is known to your Eminence that I did not expect at all\r\nthe said decree, that I was never so much surprised in my life as when I\r\nreceived the bare circular from Propaganda on the morning of the 28th\r\nulto. And fancy, I received the bare circular, as I suppose every Irish\r\nbishop did, without a letter or a word of instruction or explanation.\r\nAnd what is more unaccountable to me, only the day before I had received\r\na letter from the Secretary for the Extraordinary Ecclesiastical\r\nAffairs, telling me that nothing had been done about Irish affairs, and\r\nthat my report and other letters were still _nell casetta del Emo.\r\nRampolla!_ And yet the whole world thinks and says that the Holy Office\r\nhas acted on my report, and that the decree is based upon the same! Not\r\nonly all the Roman correspondents but all the newspapers _avec le Tablet\r\nen tête_ proclaim and report the same thing! I wish that my report and\r\nall my letters had been studied and seriously considered, and that\r\naction had been taken from the same! Above all, I had proposed and\r\ninsisted upon it, that whatever was necessary to be done ought to be\r\ndone with, and through, the bishops.\" Of this there is ample proof in\r\nthe earlier letters, and the proposal which he made was that the four\r\narchbishops and one bishop for every province should be summoned to Rome\r\nto \"prepare and settle things.\" Writing on the Feast of the Epiphany in\r\n1888, he said to Manning:--\"I agree fully with your Eminence that the\r\ntrue Nunciatura for England and Ireland is the Episcopate. If the\r\nbishops do not know the state of the country they are not fit to be\r\nbishops. If they do, what more can _una persona ufficiosa o ufficiale_\r\ndo for the Holy See?\" And again--\"I fully understand what your Eminence\r\nadds, the English people tolerate the Catholic Church as a spiritual\r\nbody. The first sign of a political action on the Government would\r\nrekindle all the old fears, suspicions, and hostility. It is a great\r\npity they do not realise this in Rome. And it is also a great pity that\r\nEnglish Catholics do not understand all this. I am sure that His\r\nHoliness understands it well, but I share your fears that those about\r\nhim may harass him with the fickle and vain glory that would accrue to\r\nthe Holy See by having an accredited representative from England also.\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible not to infer from this that the English Catholics were\r\nengaged in an attempt to secure diplomatic recognition by Great Britain\r\nof the Holy See, and that their anxiety to secure this was in some\r\nmeasure connected with their desire to override the feelings and\r\nopinions of the Irish Episcopate, but the overtures of Lord Salisbury\r\nwere as fruitless as those of Russell forty years before.\r\n\r\nThe last letter from Mgr. Persico to the English Cardinal, which has\r\nbeen reprinted, reiterates the disclaimer of responsibility for the\r\naction of the Vatican, in these words:--\r\n\r\n\"I had no idea that anything had been done about Irish affairs much less\r\nthought that some questions had been referred to the Holy Office, and\r\nthe first knowledge I had of the decree was on the morning of the 28th\r\nApril, when I received the bare circular sent me by Propaganda. I must\r\nadd that had I known of such a thing I would have felt it my duty to\r\nmake proper representations to the Holy See.\"\r\n\r\nIn view of this it is interesting to read the naïve record in the\r\n_Tablet_ of those who signed the address to Persico on the totally wrong\r\nassumption that he and his report were the _causa causans_ of the\r\ndecree. \"The signatures,\" says the _Tablet_, \"comprise those of all the\r\nCatholic peers in Ireland (14 in number), four Privy Councillors, ten\r\nhonourables, two Lords Lieutenants of counties, nineteen baronets,\r\nfifty-four deputy-lieutenants, two hundred and ninety-seven magistrates,\r\nand a large number of the learned and military professions.\" The\r\nremarkable thing about this memorial was the absence of the names of any\r\nclerics, regular or secular, parish priests or prelates.\r\n\r\nThere are in Ireland a great many more Protestant Nationalists than the\r\nEnglish Press allows its readers to suspect, and it is one of these who,\r\nin a recent novel, declares in a wild hyperbole that if the bishops can\r\nsecure the continuance of English Government for the next half century\r\nIreland will have become the Church's property. No one, of course, with\r\nany sense of proportion takes seriously such a statement as this, but I\r\nallude to it as showing, in its extreme anti-clericalism, the same\r\ntendency, very much magnified, as I have observed to a great extent in\r\nthe Protestant Nationalist as a class, who has not, as I believe, had\r\ntime to eliminate the last taint of No Popery feeling in which for\r\ngenerations he and his forbears have been steeped. The existence of this\r\nanti-clerical spirit, and, what is more to the point, its expression\r\nwith the proverbial tactlessness of the political convert, for such a\r\none the Protestant Nationalist usually is, make it very essential that\r\nthe Catholic clergy should walk warily and avoid giving any handle to\r\ntheir detractors, for in Ireland, and perhaps most of all in the Church\r\nin Ireland, there is need to use the prayer of the faithful\r\nCommons--\"that the best possible construction be put on one's motives.\"\r\nHow small is the basis for the allegation that the clergy are playing\r\nonly for the Church's hand and are prepared to sacrifice for this end\r\nthe welfare of the country is shown, I think, by the evidence which I\r\nhave adduced. But in spite of their ill success in the past there is a\r\npersistent notion on the part of both English parties that they can drag\r\nin ecclesiastical influence to redress the political balance in their\r\nfavour. The exposure in the Life of Lord Randolph Churchill of the\r\nmanner in which he proposed to Lord Salisbury to win over the Church to\r\nUnionism is an example of what I mean:--[16]\r\n\r\n\"I have no objection to Sexton and Healy knowing the deliberate\r\nintention of the Government on the subject of Irish education, but it\r\nwould not do for the letter or communication to be made public, for the\r\neffect of publicity on Lancashire would be unfortunate.... It is the\r\nbishops entirely to whom I look in future to mitigate or postpone the\r\nHome Rule onslaught. Let us only be enabled to occupy a year with the\r\neducation question. By that time I am certain Parnell's party will have\r\nbecome seriously disintegrated. Personal jealousies, Government\r\ninfluences, Davitt and Fenian intrigues, will be at work upon the\r\ndevoted band of eighty. The bishops, who in their hearts hate Parnell,\r\nand don't care a scrap for Home Rule, having safely acquired control of\r\nIrish education, will, according to my calculation, complete the rout.\r\nThat is my policy, and I know it is sound and good, and the only\r\npossible Tory policy.\" And again he wrote--\"My opinion is that if you\r\napproach the archbishops through proper channels, if you deal in\r\nfriendly remonstrances and active assurances ... the tremendous force of\r\nthe Catholic Church will gradually and insensibly come over to the side\r\nof the Tory Party.\"\r\n\r\nAll this, of course, is perfectly consistent with the views which in\r\n1884 the leader of the Fourth Party had expressed when, speaking on the\r\nFranchise Bill, he declared his opinion that \"the agricultural peasant\r\nis much more under the proper and legitimate influence of the Roman\r\nCatholic priesthood than the lower classes in the towns.\"[17] But how is\r\none to reconcile either of these declarations with his action in 1886,\r\nwhen, the tremendous force of the Catholic Church not having come over\r\nto the Tory side, he \"decided to play the Orange card, which, please\r\nGod, will prove a trump,\" and went, with his hands red from making\r\novertures to what they considered the scarlet woman, to rally the\r\nOrangemen with the haunting jingle that Home Rule would be Rome Rule.\r\n\r\nThis was before the general election of 1886. Seven years later, when\r\nanother election was approaching, he returned to the charge, this time\r\nin a letter to Lord Justice FitzGibbon:--\"What is the great feature,\" he\r\nwrote, \"of the political situation in Ireland now? The resurrection in\r\ngreat force of priestly domination in political matters. Now I would\r\ncool the ardour of these potentates for Mr. G. by at once offering them\r\nthe largest concessions on education--primary, intermediate, and\r\nuniversity--which justice and generosity could admit of. I would not\r\ngive them everything before the general election, but I would give a\r\ngood lot, and keep a good lot for the new Parliament. I do not think\r\nthey could resist the bribe, and the soothing effect of such a policy on\r\nthe Irish vote and attitude would be marked. Of course the concessions\r\nwould have to be very large--almost as large as what the bishops have\r\never asked for, but preserving intact Trinity College. It would assume\r\nthe material shape of a money subsidy.\"[18]\r\n\r\nI have set down without omissions and with nothing extenuate the data on\r\nwhich is based the indictment that the clergy have been, and are,\r\nanti-national, and I ask the reader to say whether the charge is\r\nunsupported or not. That overtures have again and again been made _sub\r\nrosa_ to the clergy to wean them from the popular side is proved up to\r\nthe hilt, but that in any single instance they have closed with the\r\noffers or been forced by the rigours of ecclesiastical discipline into\r\ncompliance, appears to me not proven, as is also the imputation that the\r\npeople have in any degree departed from the lines of O'Connell's\r\ndictum--that we take our theology from Rome, but our politics we prefer\r\nof home manufacture. If the action of Cardinal Cullen with regard to the\r\nTenant League in 1855 be adduced as an argument in favour of the\r\nproposition, it must be remembered that though as Primate his voice was\r\npreponderant and his policy was affected, in Dr. MacHale, the Archbishop\r\nof Tuam, an exponent of opposite views was to be found, and that it is\r\non the lines laid down by MacHale, and not those advocated by Cullen,\r\nthat the policy of the Catholic Church in Ireland has as a rule been\r\nbased.\r\n\r\nThe clergy in the early part of the nineteenth century were brought up\r\nin foreign seminaries, where passive obedience to the established order\r\nwas inculcated, and where, as was natural in such places, a horror of\r\nthe Jacobinical principles of the French revolution created among them\r\nan antagonism to any violent agitation, which admittedly or not drew its\r\ninspiration from that source, but the names of Dr. Doyle of Kildare, of\r\nDr. Duggan of Clonfert, of Dr. Croke of Cashel, of Dr. M'Cormick, to\r\nname only four, show how much support was given to the popular cause in\r\nIreland by a considerable section of the higher clergy.\r\n\r\nTo Protestant Nationalists I would commend that expression of opinion of\r\nthe greatest of their number--Edmund Burke--who, speaking of the\r\nreligion of the mass of his countrymen, declared that in his opinion \"it\r\nought to be cherished as a good, though not the most preferable good if\r\na choice was now to be made, and not tolerated as an inevitable evil. It\r\nis extraordinary that there should still be need to emphasise the fact\r\nthat the Catholicism of Ireland is inevitable and that there is no hope\r\nof making the country abjure it--but this is the case.\"\r\n\r\nHalf a century ago, when proselytism was in full swing in a country\r\nweakened by famine, Protestants were sanguine on this point. Sir\r\nFrancis Head, in a volume which bears the very naïve title of \"A\r\nFortnight in Ireland,\" declared that within a couple of years there can\r\nexist no doubt whatever that the Protestant population of Ireland will\r\nform the majority, and Rev. A.R. Dallas, one of the leading\r\nproselytisers in the country, borrowing a Biblical metaphor, announced\r\nthat \"the walls of Irish Romanism had been circumvented again and\r\nagain, and at the trumpet blast that sounded in the wailings of the\r\nfamine they may be said to have fallen flat. This is the point of hope\r\nin Ireland's present crisis.\"\r\n\r\nWith the maintenance by the Church of her hold over the people\r\ngovernments have recognised the influence of the priests, and have tried\r\nto turn it to their own use by methods into which they have been afraid\r\nto let the light of day; and for the rest, with every trouble and every\r\ndiscontent, has arisen the parrot cry of _cherchez le prêtre_.\r\nConscientious objections to certain forms of education are respected in\r\nEngland when they are emphasised by passive resistance. How many times\r\nhave the same objections in Ireland been put down to clerical\r\nobscurantism? The priest in politics we have been told _ad nauseam_ is\r\nthe curse of Ireland, but clerical interference is not unknown in\r\nEnglish villages, and one has heard of dissenting ministers whose hands\r\nare not quite unstained by the defilement of political partisanship. It\r\nis not the habit that makes the monk, and it is possible for\r\nsacerdotalism to be as rampant among the most rigid of dissenters as in\r\nChurch itself. An example of the falsehoods which have at intervals to\r\nbe nailed to the counter was the one which declared that under the\r\ncompulsion of their priests a considerable part of the Irish electorate\r\nfalsely declared themselves to be illiterate, so that the secrecy of the\r\nballot might be avoided and their votes might be regulated by the\r\nclergy. On a comparison of the statistics of illiterate voters and the\r\nCensus of illiteracy a similar proportion was found to exist as that\r\nbetween the total number of voters and the whole population, in this way\r\ncompletely disproving the allegation.\r\n\r\nA great deal of capital has of late been made of the alleged excessive\r\nchurch building in Ireland during the last few years. In the light of\r\nthe fact that less than forty years have passed since the money of these\r\nsame peasants for the expenditure of which so much concern is now\r\nexpressed, was devoted to the maintenance of what Disraeli admitted to\r\nbe an alien Church, it is a little surprising to hear this taunt from\r\nEnglishmen and Protestants. Relieved, as the people have been only in\r\nthe last generation, from this obligation it is not strange that the\r\nwork of providing churches for their own worship should have been\r\nundertaken. The Catholic churches have in large measure been built by\r\nthe contributions of successful emigrants, subscribed in many instances\r\nwith the secondary object of providing work in building during times of\r\ndistress. There are 2,400 Catholic and 1,500 Protestant churches in\r\nIreland at the present moment, and there is one Episcopalian Protestant\r\nchurch for every 320 members of that creed and one Catholic church for\r\nevery 1,368 Catholics.\r\n\r\nSir Horace Plunkett, who started this new fashion of attack by giving it\r\nthe cachet of respectability in the first edition of \"Ireland in the New\r\nCentury,\" after declaring that he has \"come to the conclusion that the\r\nimmense power of the Irish Roman Catholic clergy has been singularly\r\nlittle abused,\" goes on to add in connection with the topic on which we\r\nare touching that \"without a doubt a good many motives are unfortunately\r\nat work in the church-building movement which have but remote connection\r\nwith religion.\" What is meant by this I cannot pretend to say. It seems\r\nto me unworthy of a gentleman in Sir Horace's position, and with his\r\nacknowledged good intentions to adopt an attitude which can only be\r\ncompared to that which Pope satirised in the lines:--\r\n\r\n  \"Damn with faint praise, assent with civil leer,\r\n  And without sneering teach the rest to sneer,\r\n  Willing to wound, and yet afraid to strike,\r\n  Just hint a fault, and hesitate dislike.\"\r\n\r\nBut the remarkable part of the facts about this unframed charge is that\r\nin the popular edition of Sir Horace's book, published in 1905, the\r\npassage which I have quoted is omitted, and in spite of the fact that\r\nnearly forty pages are devoted to an Epilogue containing answers to his\r\ncritics, the author makes no mention of its omission, and gives no\r\nreason for the implied retractation of what may be interpreted as being\r\na very grave charge.\r\n\r\nThe books of one or two writers on the abuses of clericalism in Ireland,\r\nwritten in violent, unmeasured invective, and innocent--which is more\r\nimportant--of all notion of the value of evidence, are, I understand,\r\neagerly snapped up and readily believed by pious Protestants in England,\r\nand it is from these books that many Englishmen have learnt all that\r\nthey know to-day about the Church in Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe picture which is presented of the Irish priest as a money-grabbing\r\nmartinet, whom his flock regard with mingled sentiments of detestation\r\nand fear, is a caricature as libellous as it is grotesque. Even the high\r\nstandard of sexual morality which prevails in the country is attacked as\r\nbeing merely the result of early marriages, inculcated by a priesthood\r\nthirsting for marriage fees, and virtue itself is in this way depicted\r\nas being nothing but the bye-product of grasping avarice. I would not\r\nhave thought it necessary to have touched on this subject if I were not\r\nassured of the vast circulation of the type of books to which I refer,\r\nwhich are not worth powder and shot, more particularly in dissenting and\r\nevangelical circles in England. The reiterated assertion by their\r\nauthor that he is a Catholic produces the entirely false impression\r\nthat he is the spokesman of a considerable body of Catholics in Ireland\r\nwhose mouths are closed by the fear of consequences.\r\n\r\nOne fact which shows how bitter is the hatred towards the religion of\r\nIreland on the part of a section of the population of England is\r\nthis--that there is no more certain method by which a book on that\r\ncountry can be assured of advertisement and quotation in the English\r\nparty Press of the baser kind, which for partisan reasons plays on the\r\nbigotry of English people by the booming of such books, no matter how\r\nscurrilous or how vile are their innuendoes. The comment of M.\r\nPaul-Dubois on these attempts to foist on the Catholic Church\r\nresponsibility for the evil case in which Ireland finds herself,\r\ndeserves quotation:--\"Cette thèse grossière et fanatique ne vaut\r\nl'honneur d'un devellopment ni d'une discussion: contentons nous de\r\nremarquer comme il est habile et simple de rejeter sur Rome la\r\nresponsabilité des malheurs d'Erin en disculpant ainsi et l'Angleterre\r\net la colonie anglaise en Irlande!\"\r\n\r\nThe energy of the Irish priesthood in the advocacy of temperance--an\r\nenergy which in a climate like that of Ireland can never be excessive;\r\ntheir social work in the encouragement of the industrial revival by the\r\nstarting of agricultural and co-operative societies, and, most of all at\r\nthis time, of the Industrial Development Association; their\r\nwhole-hearted assistance in the work of the Gaelic League, and their aid\r\nin the discouragement of emigration--all these, apart from their\r\nspiritual labours, are factors which have increased their claims to the\r\naffection of the people to whom they minister and the respect of their\r\nnon-Catholic fellow-countrymen. They have discouraged violence, and the\r\nweight of their Church has always been directed against secret\r\nsocieties, and if their power has been great it is only because they\r\nhave been in full sympathy with their flocks. In 1848 the clergy made\r\nsuch efforts to check the excesses of the abortive insurrection of that\r\nyear that Lord Clarendon, the Viceroy, wrote to Lord John Russell to\r\ntell him that something must be done for the clergy, but the bigotry of\r\nthe English and Scottish people stood in the way. The No Rent Manifesto\r\nof 1881 fell flat owing to the ecclesiastical condemnation which it\r\nincurred on the ground that it involved repudiation of debts. Every\r\narticle in the Press of Europe and America on the problem of \"race\r\nsuicide\" contained a well-deserved tribute to the moral influence of the\r\nIrish clergy on their flocks in this direction, and the figures of\r\nillegitimacy show the same results of their inculcation of sexual\r\nmorality. In 1904 there were 3.9 per cent. of such births in England and\r\nWales, in Scotland 6.46, and in Ireland 2.5. The highest rate in\r\nIreland--3.4 in Ulster--is almost the same as the lowest in Scotland--in\r\nDumbartonshire--and the contrast between the Scottish maximum of 14.3 in\r\nKincardine and the Irish minimum of .7 in Connacht needs no comment.\r\n\r\nWith regard to ecclesiasticism in the lower branches of education, while\r\nconvinced that popular control over the secular branches, leaving the\r\nreligious branches of such education completely in the hands of the\r\nclergy, is the ideal arrangement, one must admit that there is a\r\nstriking testimony contained in the Report on Primary Education drawn up\r\nin 1904 by Mr. F.H. Dale, as to the efficiency and good management of\r\nthe Convent Schools in Ireland, which, it should be noted, are at the\r\nsame time those of least expense to the State. The cleanliness and\r\nneatness of the premises, the supervision and management on the part of\r\nthe Community, the order and tone of the children, are all highly\r\npraised; and in a further Report on Intermediate Education, prepared by\r\nthe same Inspector of Schools jointly with a colleague, will be found\r\nequally strong insistence on the well-known success and efficiency of\r\nthe three hundred schools of the Christian Brothers, in which, without\r\na penny of State aid, are educated some 30,000 pupils; and it was no\r\ndoubt to the education given by the Christian Brothers that the\r\nProtestant Bishop of Killaloe referred when, in an address to his\r\ndiocesan synod five years ago, he generously recognised the superiority\r\nof the Catholic over the Protestant schools in Ireland.\r\n\r\nIt was Lord Lytton, I think, who described the Established Church in\r\nIreland as the greatest bull in the language, since it was so called\r\nbecause it was a church not for the Irish. All who are acquainted with\r\nthose masterpieces of Swift's satire--the Drapier Letters--and who\r\nappreciate the fact that Berkeley--the most distinguished of Irish\r\nProtestant bishops--was refused the Primacy of Ireland because he was an\r\nIrishman, and that to appoint any but an Englishman or a Scotsman would\r\nbe to depart from the policy followed throughout the whole of the\r\neighteenth century, will see that at that time, at any rate, it deserved\r\nthe censure which it has received as a foreign body maintained for\r\ndenationalising purposes.\r\n\r\nThe maintenance until thirty-eight years ago of the Established Church,\r\nwhich raised its mitred head in a country where its adherents formed\r\none-eighth of the population, but where its funds were extorted from\r\nthose who regarded its doctrines as heresy, was, I verily believe, the\r\n_fons et origo_ of the sectarian bitterness which still persists among\r\nCatholics, \"Lui demander,\" wrote a French observer of the position of\r\nthe Catholic Church in the days before 1870, \"de s'associer a une telle\r\nentreprise lui parait une injure; lui forcer est une violence; la\r\ncontinuance de cette violence est une persecution.\" You would find it\r\nhard to make me believe that had England been the scene of a similar\r\nanomaly, with the _rôles_, of course, exchanged, the feelings towards\r\nthe Catholic Church, even forty years after its disestablishment, would\r\nbe the most cordial. The proposals of Pitt for the State payment of\r\nthe Catholic priesthood were constantly revived and advocated throughout\r\nthe century. Lord Clarendon's views, which have just been quoted, were a\r\nmere echo of the opinion expressed by Lord John Russell in favour of\r\nconcurrent endowment in 1844, and there is a significant allusion on the\r\npart of Charles Greville fourteen years earlier to the feeling of that\r\ntime, in which, after speaking about Irish disaffection, he shows the\r\nresults which were expected from concurrent endowment by commenting\r\nunfavourably on the policy which the Government pursued \"instead of\r\ndepriving him (O'Connell) of half his influence by paying the priests\r\nand so getting them under the influence of the Government.\"[19]\r\n\r\nThe whole question was considered merely in the abstract until the\r\nFenian outburst of the sixties--as Mr. Gladstone freely admitted--opened\r\nmen's eyes to this among the other serious problems of Irish government.\r\nIt required all the violence of desperate men to call, attention to a\r\ncondition of things in which the Church which was established numbered\r\nless than one-eighth of the inhabitants of the country among its\r\nadherents.\r\n\r\nThe part of the country in which the greatest proportion of Episcopalian\r\nProtestants was to be found was Ulster, and there they were only 20 per\r\ncent. of the people, while in Munster and Connacht they were only 5 and\r\n4 per cent. respectively. In 199 out of 2,428 parishes in Ireland there\r\nwas not a single member of the Established Church. The net revenue of\r\nthe Church was £600,000, and of this two archbishops and ten bishops\r\nreceived one-tenth. The mode of solving the inequitable state of affairs\r\nwhich produced least resistance lay in the direction of concurrent\r\nendowment. Earl Russell suggested the endowment of Catholics and\r\nPresbyterians and the reduction of Episcopalian revenues to one-eighth\r\nof their existing amount. To the Presbyterians his plan would have\r\nentailed a gain, in so far as the Regium Donum would have been\r\nincreased, but the opposition to it of the Catholics, in spite of the\r\nfact that levelling up rather than planing down appealed not only to\r\nRussell but to Grey and Disraeli, resulted in its abandonment, and the\r\nquestion of disestablishment became the recognised solution of the\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of the Bill in 1869 began those dire prophecies\r\nand grim forebodings which have formed a running accompaniment to every\r\nIrish reform, and Mr. Gladstone and the Liberals were denounced for\r\nhaving sanctioned sacrilege. In the end the Church saved from the\r\nburning more than in any equitable sense she was entitled to claim. The\r\nRepresentative Body, which was incorporated in 1870, received about nine\r\nmillions for commuted salaries, half a million in lieu of private\r\nendowments, and another three-quarters of a million was handed over to\r\nlay patrons.\r\n\r\nThe commutation paid to the Non-Conformists for the Regium Donum and\r\nother payments was nearly £800,000, and in lieu of the Maynooth grant\r\nthe Catholic Church received less than £400,000, the income from which\r\nfund only covers about one-third of the annual cost of maintenance of\r\nMaynooth. The history of this grant dates from the £9,000 given to the\r\nCollege by the Irish Parliament, which was increased by Peel in 1844 to\r\n£26,000 a year. When in the following year he brought in a Bill to make\r\nit a vote of,£30,000 for building purposes, the _Times_, according to\r\nGreville, \"kept pegging away at Peel in a series of articles as\r\nmischievous as malignity could make them, and by far the most\r\ndisgraceful that have ever appeared on a political subject in any public\r\njournal.\"\r\n\r\nThat on the purely financial side the Catholic Church in Ireland would\r\nhave gained by concurrent endowment these figures, which represent the\r\nwhole of her receipts from public funds, amply bear witness, but that\r\nshe gained in a moral sense far more than in a material sense she might\r\nhave secured, no one will for one moment deny.\r\n\r\nThe glaring discrepancy between the amount of public funds at her\r\ndisposal and the amount held by the other religious bodies from public\r\nsources did not abate the virulence with which the Church Act was\r\nassailed, but at this day what is of interest is that the jeremiads of\r\nthe Protestants as to the consequences either to the country at large or\r\nto their Church in particular were in every respect uncalled for, as was\r\nacknowledged by no less a person than Lord Plunket, at a later time\r\nArchbishop of Dublin, who, when in that position, admitted that the\r\nChurch Act had proved not a curse, as was expected, but a blessing to\r\nthe Episcopalian Protestant Church. This body has at the present moment\r\nin Ireland 1,500 churches, to which 1,600 clergy minister, and as the\r\npopulation of that sect amounts to very little more than half a million\r\nit appears that there is one parson for every 363 parishioners, 800\r\nPresbyterian ministers serve nearly a half million of people in the\r\nproportion of one for every 554 of that communion. 250 Methodist\r\nministers are sufficient for 62,000 people in the ratio of one for every\r\n248, and the 3,711 Catholic priests, who serve nearly four million of\r\nsouls, are in the proportion of one for every 891, while in England the\r\npriests of the same communion amount to one for every 542. These figures\r\nshow the measure of truth in the alleged swamping of Ireland with\r\npriests. In proportion to the number of their flocks all the other\r\ndenominations have a much larger relative number of clergy in the\r\ncountry, and until the very much more flagrant drainage due to\r\nemigration has ceased, it is to be hoped that we shall hear a good deal\r\nless about the danger in an increase of celibates in Ireland, a\r\ndanger--if it be one--which after all she shares with every other\r\nCatholic country in the world. The alleged extortion of money by the\r\nclergy from a poverty-stricken peasantry is scarcely borne out by the\r\nevidence before the Royal Commission on the Financial Relations, in\r\nwhich Dr. O'Donnell, Bishop of Raphoe, calculated that the average\r\ncontribution to the clergy in the West of Ireland, including\r\nsubscriptions for the building and maintenance of churches, is 6s. or\r\n7s. a year per family.\r\n\r\nThat strange accusation of Sir Horace Plunkett, that \"the clergy are\r\ntaking the joy--the innocent joy--from the social side of the home\r\nlife,\" was, I think, sufficiently answered by the apposite reply of M.\r\nPaul-Dubois, that this is a strange reproach in the mouth of a\r\nProtestant who has undergone the experience of spending a Sunday in\r\nBelfast. The truth is that attacks on the Irish priesthood came ill from\r\nEnglishmen or Anglo-Irishmen who have found in the Catholic Church the\r\nmost powerful agent of social peace in the country. That Irishmen have\r\non this ground any reason to blame the priesthood for lack of patriotism\r\nI as strongly deny, for though one may not think necessarily that God is\r\non the side of the big battalions, armed resistance, which from the\r\nnature of things must be borne down by sheer force of weight, is as\r\ninsensate as it is destructive.\r\n\r\nThe figure of Father O'Flynn, drawn by the son of a bishop of the\r\nProtestant Church, professes to be as much a picture of a type as the\r\nFrench _curé_ whom Mr. Austin Dobson has so gracefully depicted, and it\r\nis difficult to see how such a figure of genial kindliness could have\r\nbeen portrayed in such a quarter or have received such general\r\nacceptance if there were to be found in any number worth considering the\r\nhard and worldly beggars on horseback whom their enemies allege\r\nconstitute the characteristic type of the Irish clergy.\r\n\r\nIf in the religious nature of the Irish people is to be found one reason\r\nfor the influence of the clergy in secular matters, a far more potent\r\nfactor is to be seen in the historical fact that the priest has for\r\ncenturies been the only guide, counsellor, and friend of the Irish\r\npeasant. The absence of a well-educated middle class, which, failing a\r\nsympathetic aristocracy, would, in a normal condition of things, provide\r\npopular leaders, is the only thing which has maintained any such undue\r\npredominance on the part of the clergy in secular affairs as exists.\r\nWith the development of an educated Catholic laity, among some members\r\nof which one may expect to see evolved that critical acumen and balanced\r\njudgment which are what the fine flower of a university culture is\r\nsupposed to produce, this preponderance will disappear, but in the\r\nmeanwhile, be it noted, it is the refusal of Englishmen to found an\r\nacceptable university which is maintaining the very state of affairs in\r\nthis direction against which they protest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE EDUCATIONAL PROBLEM\r\n\r\n     \"When I consider how munificently the Colleges of Oxford and\r\n     Cambridge are endowed ... when I remember from whom all this\r\n     splendour and plenty is derived; when I remember what was the\r\n     faith of Edward the Third, and of Henry the Sixth, of Margaret\r\n     of Anjou, and Margaret of Richmond, of William of Wykeham, and\r\n     of William of Waynefleet, of Archbishop Chicheley, and\r\n     Cardinal Wolsey; when I remember what we have taken from the\r\n     Roman Catholics, King's College, New College, Christ Church,\r\n     my own Trinity; and when I look at the miserable Dotheboys\r\n     Hall which we have given them in exchange, I feel, I must own,\r\n     less proud than I could wish of being a Protestant and a\r\n     Cambridge man.\"--T.B. MACAULAY, Speech on the Maynooth\r\n     Grant, 1845.\r\n\r\n     \"What the Irish are proposing is nothing so enormous or\r\n     chimerical. They propose merely to put an end to one very\r\n     cruel result of the Protestant ascendancy, the result that\r\n     they--the immense majority of the Irish people--have no\r\n     University, while the Protestants in Ireland, the small\r\n     minority, have one. For this plain hardship they propose a\r\n     plain remedy, and to their proposal they want a plain,\r\n     straightforward answer.\"--MATTHEW ARNOLD, _Mixed Essays_,\r\n     1880.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fact that the recurrent educational problem in England is that of\r\nthe Elementary Schools, while as to Ireland the only question which is\r\never to any extent ventilated is that of University Education, has led\r\nto the totally wrong impression that everything in this sphere in\r\nIreland, with the exception of Higher Education, is in a satisfactory\r\ncondition. Nothing, in point of fact, could be further from the truth,\r\nand perhaps the strongest indictment against the present Executive\r\nsystem in the country is to be found in the chaos which exists in\r\neducational matters.\r\n\r\nThe National system of Education in Ireland was started by Lord Stanley\r\nin 1833. Up to that date there had been no organised education in the\r\ncountry, and in fact there were still many living who could recall the\r\ntime when for a Catholic to receive education from his co-religionists\r\nwas a penal offence, involving legal and equitable disabilities.\r\n\r\nThe main vehicles of elementary education up to this date were the\r\nCharter Schools and the Kildare Street Schools. The former, which were\r\nfounded about 1730 by Primate Boulter, and lasted a hundred years, were\r\nfrankly proselytising agencies--the address for the charter to the Crown\r\nspecifically setting out that it was a society for teaching the\r\nProtestant religion to Papist children. John Howard, the philanthropist,\r\ncondemned them as a disgrace to Protestantism and a disgrace to all\r\nsociety, but for all that, in the course of their career, they cost the\r\npublic nearly two millions of money. The Kildare Street Schools, which\r\nwere founded in 1811, and which secured a Government grant for the first\r\ntime in 1814, professed to be non-sectarian, and so long as they kept to\r\ntheir professions were successful, but their subsequent association with\r\nproselytising agencies, such as the Hibernian Society, was their ruin,\r\nand in 1831 the public grant was withdrawn from them by the Chief\r\nSecretary, who two years later introduced the National System.\r\n\r\nOn the establishment of the National Board all creeds and parties in\r\nIreland were anxious that the basis of the system should be\r\ndenominational, but in the teeth of this unanimity the principle adopted\r\nwas that of united secular and separate religious instruction.\r\n\r\nOne would have thought that on the establishment of the National System\r\nthe danger of its capture by the Protestant ascendancy, which was very\r\nobviously anxious to secure its control, would have ensured the\r\ninsistence on safeguards for the rights of the weaker section of the\r\ncommunity at a time when no longer held good that _obiter dictum_\r\npronounced from the Bench in 1758, which was equally true for many years\r\nafter, that \"the law does not suppose a Papist to exist in the kingdom,\r\nnor can they breathe without the connivance of the Government.\" On its\r\nformation the National Board included among its members Dr. Murray, the\r\nCatholic Archbishop of Dublin; Dr. Whately, the Protestant Archbishop of\r\nthat city; and Dr. Carlisle, a Presbyterian Minister. No attempt was\r\nmade to effect anything approaching a proportional representation of the\r\ncreeds concerned, and the two Catholic members were outvoted by their\r\nfive Protestant colleagues on the Board for the control of the education\r\nof the children of a population in which Catholics were to Protestants\r\nin the ratio of about 4 to 1.\r\n\r\nThe English Archbishop and the Scottish Presbyterian, in whom power was\r\nin this way placed, set themselves by their regulations to effect the\r\nAnglicising of the Irish children in the schools of the country. The use\r\nof the English language was enforced for the education of children,\r\nthousands of whom spoke Gaelic, and though this may possibly be\r\njustified on grounds of its greater use in the transactions of everyday\r\nlife, the same cannot be said of the manner in which the history books\r\nemployed were of a kind in which the subjection of Ireland by Elizabeth,\r\nJames I., and William of Orange were extolled, as was also the defection\r\nfrom Rome of England in the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nWhately's policy was avowedly to Anglicise the children in the schools,\r\nto effect the \"consolidation,\" as he called it, of Great Britain and\r\nIreland, and in a reading book produced under his auspices occur the\r\nfollowing lines, written with that aim in view:--\"On the east of Ireland\r\nis England, where the Queen lives. Many people who live in Ireland were\r\nborn in England, and we speak the same language, and are called one\r\nnation.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the reading-books as first published were expunged such verses as\r\nCampbell's \"Downfall of Roland\" and Scott's \"Breathes There a Man with a\r\nSoul so Dead,\" owing to their tendency, one must suppose, to suggest\r\nemotions other than those which it was deemed fitting to inculcate, and\r\nin their place was inserted a verse from the Archbishop's own pen which\r\nis familiar to most Irishmen, but which is, I find, unknown to most\r\nEnglishmen:--\r\n\r\n  \"I thank the goodness and the grace which on my birth have smiled,\r\n  And made me in these Christian days a happy English child.\"\r\n\r\nTo appreciate fully the irony of the divergence between the sentiments\r\nexpressed and the real facts, one must remember that these lines were\r\nwritten at a time when land reform and church disestablishment were\r\nregarded by those in authority as the proposals of unspeakable\r\ndemagogues.\r\n\r\nThe views of Whately on the value of the educational machine which he\r\ncontrolled, as an instrument of proselytism are very frankly set out in\r\na conversation which he had with Nassau Senior, which is quoted from the\r\ndiary of the latter in the Archbishop's biography:--\r\n\r\n\"I believe,\" he said, \"that mixed education is gradually enlightening\r\nthe mass of the people, and that if we give it up we give up the only\r\nhope of weaning the Irish from the abuses of Popery. But I cannot\r\nventure openly to profess this opinion. I cannot openly support the\r\nEducation Board as an instrument of conversion. I have to fight its\r\nbattles with one hand, and that my best, tied behind me.\"[20]\r\n\r\nThis extract more than justifies the policy by which, when Dr. MacHale\r\nsucceeded Dr. Murray in Dublin, a bland acquiescence in Governmental\r\naction began to be no longer the line of action of Catholic prelates.\r\n\r\nThe system of National Education was, as I have said, founded at its\r\ninception on the principles of undenominationalism, but, as a matter of\r\nfact, the determined views of all creeds in Ireland prevailed to a very\r\ngreat extent, so that at the end of the nineteenth century out of a\r\ntotal of 8,700 schools in the country more than 5,000 were attended by\r\nchildren of one religion only; of these 4,000 were Catholic schools, the\r\nremaining 1,000 belonging to one or other of the Protestant\r\ndenominations. Of the 3,700 schools which are not purely denominational,\r\nthere are many in which the great majority of the pupils belong to one\r\nreligion, but in these, of course, the minority is safeguarded by a\r\nconscience clause.\r\n\r\nThe members of the National Board are appointed to-day--as they were in\r\n1833--by Dublin Castle. They are nominees in no sense responsible to\r\nanyone, amateurs in educational matters, whose debates are carried on\r\n_in camera_, and when they have arrived at decisions their fiat goes\r\nforth without reason being given for changes of system or of policy, and\r\nwithout opportunity being afforded for revision or appeal.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances it is not surprising that the system of\r\nelementary education in Ireland does not meet with the popular attention\r\nthat it should. There is no consultation on the part of the Board with\r\nthose responsible for carrying on changes which it orders, and when\r\ninnovations are introduced without reasons being offered, those who have\r\nto apply them are not likely to do so with good grace, still less with\r\nenthusiasm. When the arguments and reasons in favour of alterations are\r\nunknown to the public such changes almost invariably meet with\r\nopposition at the hands of those who have to effect them.\r\n\r\nThe multiplication of schools arising partly from the denominationalism\r\nwhich so largely holds the field is accentuated by the financial system\r\nwhich is adopted by the National Board. In all the schools under its\r\ncontrol, with the exception of the 300 convent and monastery schools,\r\nwhere the State-aid takes the form of a capitation grant, the grant is\r\near-marked for the payment of teachers' salaries, the largest charge\r\nincurred by the school; and in this way the responsibility on that\r\naccount and the occasion for economy on that score of the managers is\r\nremoved, leaving to them only the control of the school buildings.\r\nMoreover, the non-application of the capitation system of grants fails\r\nto bring into play what would be a direct financial inducement to the\r\nlocality to improve the school attendance of the children, as would also\r\nany system of local control. The small size of existing school areas\r\nresults in inevitable mischief, for under it the poorest districts are\r\nthose in which the school accommodation is worst, and since more money\r\nhas to be raised than in richer localities the poorer districts have to\r\npay most and the richest least for elementary education.\r\n\r\nA primary effect of the larger number of schools is that the average\r\nattendance is much smaller than in Scotland, where conditions are in\r\nmany respects similar, and side by side with the small size of the\r\nschools goes the very low standard of salaries paid to the teachers,\r\nwhich begin at £56 a year for men and £44 each for women, and advance by\r\ntriennial increments to £172 for men and £140 for women. Two-thirds of\r\nthe primary school teachers of Ireland have a salary of less than 30s. a\r\nweek. The average payment to head teachers is in Scotland 75 per cent.\r\nand in England 48 per cent. higher than in Ireland. The general state of\r\ninefficiency of education in Ireland may be gathered from the fact that\r\nthe Census of 1901 showed that of persons over five years of age no less\r\nthan 13.7 per cent. could neither read nor write, the percentage of\r\nilliteracy being in the four provinces, 11.3 in Leinster, 12.5 in\r\nUlster, 14 in Munster, and 20.7 in Connaught. The children in Scottish\r\nschools attend on 85 per cent. of the days on which the schools are\r\nopen, in English on 84 per cent., and in Irish schools only on 65 per\r\ncent.; but in considering these figures allowance must be made for the\r\nfact that school attendance in Great Britain has been compulsory for\r\njust over thirty years, while in Ireland it was only in 1892 that an Act\r\nwas passed sanctioning the formation of School Attendance Committees\r\nwith power to enforce the attendance of children at school.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Board of National Education there are in Dublin the\r\nIntermediate Board, the Commissioners of Education, who deal with the\r\nfew Educational endowments in the country, the Department of Agriculture\r\nand Technical Instruction, the Senate of the Royal University, the Local\r\nGovernment Board attending to the education of children in work-houses,\r\nindustrial, and reformatory schools, all concerned with primary and\r\nsecondary education in its administrative aspect, while the Board of\r\nWorks is occupied with the erection of school buildings. The\r\nextravagance and inefficiency which results from this diffusion and\r\nconsequent overlapping of power and duties on the part of officials\r\nscattered about in Tyrone House, in Hume Street, in Merrion Place, and\r\nthree or four other parts of Dublin, is well illustrated by the fact\r\nthat out of every 20s. given as Exchequer aid to education--\r\n\r\n  In England and Wales\r\n  17/- goes to Education and 3/- to Administration and Inspection.\r\n\r\n  In Scotland\r\n  16/2 goes to Education and 3/10 to Administration and Inspection.\r\n\r\n  In Ireland\r\n  13/6 goes to Education and 6/6 to Administration and Inspection.\r\n\r\nAdministrative extravagance, it will be seen, is in inverse ratio to the\r\nquality of the educational service. If we take the three Irish Boards of\r\nNational, Intermediate, and Technical Education, the total cost of\r\nadministration and inspection is £120,000 per annum; the similar charge\r\non Scotland is exactly half that sum, and yet Scotland prides herself on\r\nher education, and Ireland is taunted with her illiteracy.\r\n\r\nThe state of secondary education in Ireland differs fundamentally from\r\nthat of England in this--that the number of educational endowments in\r\nthe country are extremely few. Practically the whole of the money spent\r\non this branch of education comes from taxation and school fees. It is\r\ncontrolled by the Intermediate Board, which was established some thirty\r\nyears ago, and is in its management entirely dissociated from the\r\nNational Board, so that all arrangements with a view to the transfer of\r\nclever pupils from the schools of the one type to those of the other are\r\nmade as difficult as possible.\r\n\r\nThe Intermediate schools are, on the other hand, subject to the\r\nDepartment of Technical Instruction as well as to the Intermediate\r\nBoard. Each of these awards grants, in some instances, for the same\r\nsubjects, but dependent in many cases on different standards and\r\nconditions, so that it sometimes happens that schools earn grants twice\r\nover for the same subjects; and in other cases they enjoy aid from one\r\nDepartment of State which is refused for the same subject by another,\r\nowing to failure to comply with its conditions or to attain to its\r\nstandard. Just as the connection of the Elementary schools with the\r\nIntermediate schools is very imperfect, so at the other end is the\r\nconnection with the universities. The system of payment by results,\r\nunder which the Intermediate schools are subsidised, is notoriously\r\nunsound from the point of view of education, since it leads to\r\n\"cramming,\" and, moreover, under it the amount of grant earned by a\r\nschool is subject to extreme variations. Lastly, if the pupils suffer\r\nfrom existing arrangements, the case of the teachers is no better, for\r\nfrom a recent report it will be seen that the average salary of lay\r\nteachers in Intermediate schools in Ireland is at least half what it is\r\nin corresponding schools in England.\r\n\r\nIn a country where elementary and intermediate education are in so\r\nunsatisfactory condition as we have seen them to be, one would expect\r\nuniversity education to be seriously crippled, but in Ireland there\r\narise in this connection further complications from religious\r\ndifferences which serve to perpetuate a state of affairs which twenty\r\nyears ago Mr. Balfour declared was an intolerable grievance, and which\r\nstill remains one of the chief disabilities of Ireland. There are at the\r\npresent moment two universities in the country, but since one of these\r\nis only an examining board let us begin by considering the status of the\r\nother. Trinity College, Dublin, was founded by Queen Elizabeth with the\r\nproceeds of confiscated Catholic lands, both monastic and lay, with the\r\navowed intention of propagating the principles of the Protestant\r\nreligion. During Grattan's Parliament, at the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, it threw open its gates to others than members of the\r\nEstablished Church--an example which was not followed by Oxford and\r\nCambridge for three-quarters of a century. There could be no greater\r\nmistake than to imply from this that it thereby lost its strong\r\nsectarian character. After Mr. Gladstone's attempt in 1873 to solve the\r\nUniversity question had failed, Fawcett's Act removed the religious\r\ntests which barred not only Catholics but also Presbyterians from its\r\noffices and scholarships, and thereby made the College, in theory,\r\nundenominational. In point of fact it is little less Episcopalian than\r\nit has ever been. Its chapel services are Protestant, as are also its\r\nDivinity schools. Its governing body, comprising the Provost and seven\r\nSenior Fellows, is entirely Protestant, while of the 4,200 names on its\r\nelectoral roll 2,600 are those of Protestant clergymen.\r\n\r\nOf other institutions affording opportunities for higher education in\r\nIreland, the three Queen's Colleges in Cork, Galway, and Belfast were\r\ndestined by their founder, Sir Robert Peel, who established them in\r\n1838, to supply the higher education which was lacking among the\r\nCatholics of the country. The Protestant \"atmosphere\" of Trinity being\r\nthe great obstacle in the way of Catholics who wished for higher\r\neducation for their sons, it was thought that by removing this and\r\nsetting up undenominational colleges all would be well and the religious\r\ndifficulty would be solved. It was as great a mistake as it was possible\r\nto commit. They were stigmatised by a leading Protestant of the time as\r\ngodless colleges; they ran counter to all Catholic principles of\r\neducation, which demand at least some connection between secular and\r\nreligious teaching, and the taboo to which they have in large measure\r\nbeen subjected has to a great extent resulted in making a failure of\r\nCork College, and still more of Galway College. The undenominationalism\r\nof Queen's College, Belfast, not being in opposition to the consciences\r\nof the Presbyterians of that city, has resulted in the fact that the\r\nCollege there has succeeded to a far greater extent than have the other\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nThe Royal University, founded in 1882, is, as I have said, nothing more\r\nthan an examining body, established on the lines of the London\r\nUniversity as it existed at that date, with power to award scholarships\r\nand fellowships. About fifty years ago John Henry Newman founded the\r\nCatholic University in St. Stephen's Green. Unendowed and depending on\r\nthe voluntary contributions of the poorest people in Western Europe, it\r\nis not surprising that the venture failed. From it, however, rose the\r\nUniversity College, controlled by the Jesuit Fathers, which occupies the\r\nsame buildings, and the pupils of which compete for the degrees of the\r\nRoyal University as those of the Queen's Colleges have done ever since,\r\non the foundation of the Royal University, the Queen's University--of\r\nwhich the three colleges were components--was destroyed. The indirect\r\nmode in which the Catholic University College is endowed is worthy of\r\nattention. The Royal University, out of its income from the Irish Church\r\nFund, maintains twenty-nine fellows, each with an income of £400 a year\r\non condition that they should act as examiners in the Royal University,\r\nand in addition give their services as teachers in colleges appointed by\r\nthe Senate (namely, the three Queen's Colleges, University College,\r\nDublin, and the Magee College in Derry). Of these Fellows fifteen are\r\nallotted to University College. On the assumption that of their salary\r\none-quarter represents the payment as examiners to the University--and\r\nthe estimate is generous in view of the payment of only £30 to each\r\nexaminer in the Cambridge Triposes--if this be assumed to be the case,\r\nthe remaining £300 stands for the salary given as teacher in University\r\nCollege, which thus, albeit indirectly, is endowed to the extent of\r\n£4,500 a year--a fact which, though contrasting unfavourably with the\r\n£12,000 or £13,000 enjoyed by each of the Queen's Colleges, nevertheless\r\nwould have seemed to cut the ground from under the feet of those who\r\nargued that the University question was insoluble since they would not\r\ncountenance the application of public funds to a sectarian college.\r\n\r\nIt is often alleged that the anxiety of the Irish for other facilities\r\nfor higher education than are at present afforded arises from their\r\npriest-ridden condition, and that the clergy urge the demand only in\r\norder that they may obtain more power than they already possess. The\r\nconditions in University College are some answer to this charge. It is,\r\nas I have said, under the control of the Jesuits, and a very able member\r\nof that Society is its President. Founded though it was for Catholics,\r\nthe proportion--namely, about 10 per cent.--of non-Catholic students has\r\nfor the last twenty years been greater than that of Catholics attending\r\nQueen's College, Belfast. Of its professorial staff only five out of\r\ntwenty-one are priests. There have always been some Protestants among\r\nthem, and on the governing council only one member is a priest, and of\r\nthe five laymen one is a Protestant.\r\n\r\nThe history of the University question in recent years is instructive.\r\nIn 1868 Lord Mayo, the Chief Secretary, endeavoured without success to\r\nformulate a scheme. In 1873 Mr. Gladstone brought in a Bill which risked\r\nthe life of his Government, and failed to pass. Three years later a Bill\r\nof Isaac Butt's was introduced, but was unsuccessful, and after another\r\nthree years, in 1879, was established the federal Royal University. In\r\n1885 the Conservative Chief Secretary, Sir Michael Hicks Beach,\r\nexpressed a hope on the part of the Government that in the following\r\nsession they would be able to bring in a Bill in settlement of the\r\nquestion. The letter of Lord Randolph Churchill to Lord Justice\r\nFitzGibbon, which has been quoted elsewhere, shows that at the end of\r\nthe same year the Conservative Government was anxious to make an end of\r\nthe matter by legislation. In 1889 Mr. Balfour, as Chief Secretary, on\r\ntwo occasions expressed in the House of Commons the intention of the\r\nGovernment to proceed to a solution, for the conditions in Ireland, he\r\nwent on to say, were \"such as to leave them no alternative but to devise\r\na scheme by which the wants of the Roman Catholics would be met.\" We\r\nhave seen in another connection the quotation from the Life of Lord\r\nRandolph Churchill urging legislation in 1892, and in 1896 Lord Cadogan,\r\nas Viceroy, explicitly spoke of it as \"a question with which the present\r\nGovernment will have to deal.\"\r\n\r\nEight years ago, in 1899, Mr. Balfour launched a manifesto on this\r\nquestion which proposed the maintenance of Dublin University with its\r\nEpiscopalian atmosphere, while a St. Patrick's University was to be\r\nfounded in Dublin with a Catholic atmosphere, and a University of\r\nBelfast with a Presbyterian atmosphere was to be founded on the basis of\r\nthe existing Queen's College in that city. The reasons which Mr.\r\nBalfour gave for desiring a settlement of the question deserve\r\nquotation:--\r\n\r\n\"For myself I hope a University will be granted, and I hope it will be\r\ngranted soon. I hope so, as a Unionist, because otherwise I do not know\r\nhow to claim for a British Parliament that it can do for Ireland all,\r\nand more than all, that Ireland could do for herself. I hope so as a\r\nlover of education, because otherwise the educational interests both of\r\nIrish Protestants and of Irish Roman Catholics must grievously suffer,\r\nand suffer in that department of education, the national importance of\r\nwhich is from day to day more fully recognised. I hope so as a\r\nProtestant, because otherwise too easy an occasion is given for the\r\ntaunt that in the judgment of Protestants themselves Protestantism has\r\nsomething to fear from the spread of knowledge.\"\r\n\r\nTwo years after this declaration a Royal Commission on the whole\r\nquestion was mooted, and immediately the cry of \"Hands off Trinity\" was\r\nraised, in spite of the fact that no Royal Commission had sat on that\r\nCollege since 1853, an interval of time in which there had been four\r\nCommissions on Oxford and Cambridge, and three on the Scottish\r\nUniversities. The terms of reference of the Commission of 1901 on its\r\nappointment under the chairmanship of Lord Robertson were vague. A Judge\r\nof the High Court in Ireland threatened to resign if Trinity\r\nCollege--the main centre of University education in the island--were\r\nincluded in the scope of the inquiry of a Commission on the means for\r\nobtaining such education in the country. The Commission sat in private,\r\nand it was not till the first volume of evidence was published that it\r\nwas discovered that the terms of reference had been so interpreted as to\r\nexclude Trinity from the inquiry, and to retain the services of the\r\nlearned Judge.\r\n\r\nAfter discussing the alternatives of a new Catholic University, or a\r\nreconstitution of the Royal University with the addition of a new\r\nCatholic College, the Commissioners decided in favour of the latter.\r\nTheir plan comprised a federal teaching University with four constituent\r\nColleges, the three Queen's Colleges and a new Catholic College to be\r\nsituated in Dublin. Changes in the constitution of the Queen's Colleges,\r\nto remove the religious objections at present entertained towards them\r\nwere proposed, and in reference to the endowment of the new Catholic\r\nCollege it was claimed that it was not truly open to the objection that\r\nit introduced denominational endowment into the University system of\r\nIreland since the Jesuit University College receives, and has received\r\nfor nearly a quarter of a century, a large annual sum out of moneys\r\nprovided by Acts of Parliament for University purposes. The reason which\r\nthe Commissioners gave fer not making this institution the basis of a\r\nnew College was declared to be its meagre scale which makes it\r\nunsuitable for expansion.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1904, Lord Dunraven propounded a scheme in a letter to the\r\nPress by which the question was to be solved by enlarging the University\r\nof Dublin so as to include the present Queen's College, Belfast, and a\r\nnew College which should satisfy Catholic needs in Dublin, each of the\r\nColleges being autonomous and residential, and on August 3rd, 1904, Mr.\r\nClancy, in the House of Commons, read a telegram from the Archbishop of\r\nDublin saying that the bishops would accept either the Dunraven scheme\r\nor that of the Robertson Commission.\r\n\r\nSo matters were allowed to rest until, with the advent to power of the\r\npresent Government, the lacuna, which owing to the recalcitrancy of Mr.\r\nJustice Madden, had been left in the public information on the problem\r\nby the omission of Trinity from the Robertson report, was filled up by\r\nthe appointment of a new Royal Commission.\r\n\r\nEarly this year their report was published. Five of the Commissioners\r\nare in favour of a modified Dunraven scheme, three follow the Robertson\r\nscheme, and one--the only Catholic Fellow of Trinity, one of the very\r\nfew of that faith who had ever been elected to that office--is in favour\r\nof no change, an opinion which he expounds in three lines.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered in connection with the minority recommendation\r\nthat the importance of its coincidence with that of the Robertson report\r\nmay easily be exaggerated if sufficiently strong insistence be not laid\r\nupon the exclusion of the University of Dublin from the purview of the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nThe chief respect in which the majority recommendations differ from\r\nthose of Lord Dunraven is in the inclusion in the new federal Dublin\r\nUniversity of the present Queen's College in Cork, and possibly of that\r\nof Galway. It is important to study this proposal, because it is,\r\naccording to Mr. Bryce's last words on resigning office, to be the means\r\nby which the Government hope to effect a solution.\r\n\r\nThe fact that both the Robertson and the Fry Commissions reported\r\nagainst Mr. Balfour's plan, to the promotion of the success of which in\r\nthe eight years which have elapsed he has done nothing, on the grounds\r\nof the difficulty of bringing it into play, show that for the moment\r\nopinion is set against the multiplication of Universities, and the\r\nchoice for the present lies between the two methods of dealing with the\r\ntwo existing Universities, one of which does not teach, while to the\r\nother the students of the country cannot in conscience go to be taught.\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Bryce's speech we can no longer ask British statesmen, \"How\r\nlong halt ye between two opinions?\" That the plan adopted by the\r\nGovernment is the better of the two at present mooted I shall endeavour\r\nto show. In the first place, it is a mere accident that Trinity College\r\nhas continued so long the sole College in the University of Dublin,\r\nChief Baron Palles, in a very able note appended to the report,\r\ndisentangles from a number of legal decisions and statutory declarations\r\nthe distinctions between Trinity College and the University of Dublin\r\nwhich it is endeavoured to confound. The Charter of James I., conferring\r\non Dublin the privilege of a University, foreshadowed the establishment\r\nof other Colleges. Both the Act of Settlement, 14 & 15 Car. II. (1660),\r\nand the Roman Catholic Relief Act, 1793, expressly authorise the\r\nerection of another College in the University--a fact which makes the\r\nproposed change which partisans are anxious to paint as revolutionary\r\nvandalism appear in truth merely the belated performance of a\r\nlong-expressed intention. The advantages to Trinity in making it a part\r\nof a great National University are hard to exaggerate. She has long been\r\ndescribed as the only successful British institution in Ireland, and in\r\nthat may perhaps be found the comparatively evil days on which she has\r\nfallen, as her admission lists every year testify, and as was explained\r\nto me recently by a member of the very class from which she used to draw\r\nher undergraduates, when he said--\"The respectable Protestant country\r\ngentry don't send their sons to Trinity now in the numbers in which they\r\nused to. They send them to Oxford and Cambridge.\" The last part of his\r\nremark I was able to indorse from my own personal observation.\r\n\r\nOn two occasions advances have been made by the Board of Trinity College\r\nto the heads of the Catholic hierarchy, asking them what would be their\r\nattitude if Trinity were to allow Catholic students in the College the\r\nsame facilities for religious teaching by the members of their own\r\nChurch as are at present provided for undergraduate members of the\r\nEpiscopalian Protestant Church. On the first occasion Cardinal Cullen,\r\nshortly after the passing of the University Tests Act, replied that he\r\ncould be no party to such a proposal. When the process of sounding the\r\nCatholic bishops was repeated in November, 1903, the Provost and Senior\r\nFellows expressed their willingness to consent to the erection of a\r\nCatholic chapel in the College grounds provided a sufficient sum of\r\nmoney was forthcoming for its erection. A similar advance was made to\r\nthe Moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church, and\r\nthe reply in each case was the same--that the parties concerned could\r\nnot accept the offers made by the College Board. The failure on the part\r\nof Presbyterians to make use of the College has been attributed by the\r\nCommissioners to the ancient alienation of the Presbyterians from\r\nTrinity, as well as to the existence of the useful work done for that\r\nbody by the Queen's College, Belfast. That this ancient alienation\r\nexists in the case of Catholics far more than in that of the\r\nPresbyterians is but natural, seeing that the College was founded by\r\nElizabeth to undermine the Catholicism of the people. For all that,\r\nhowever, the taunt is raised with some superficial measure of\r\nplausibility that in refusing the offer the Catholics and their bishops\r\nlay themselves open to a charge of narrowmindedness, seeing that they\r\nhave not a College suitable to their needs as have the Presbyterians in\r\nBelfast. That the _genius loci_ is Episcopalian Protestant no one will\r\ndeny. At an inaugural meeting of the College Historical Society a few\r\nyears ago Judge Webb declared--\"Their University was founded by\r\nProtestants, for Protestants, and in the Protestant interest. A\r\nProtestant spirit had from the first animated every member of its body\r\ncorporate. At the present moment, with all its toleration, all its\r\nliberality, all its comprehensiveness, and all its scrupulous honour,\r\nthe _genius loci_, the guardian spirit of the place, was Protestant. And\r\nas a Protestant he said, and said it boldly, Protestant might it\r\nevermore remain.\" To this exposition of the spirit of the College two of\r\nits most distinguished members--Lord Justice FitzGibbon and Professor\r\nMahaffy--gave their assent.\r\n\r\nIn the light of this frank admission the attitude of the Catholics\r\ntakes a new complexion. No suggestion, it will be noted, is made in the\r\novertures to the bishops to give Catholics any--not to speak of a\r\nproportionate--representation on the Councils of the College. As at\r\npresent constituted, the Board, owing to the abolition of celibacy as a\r\ncondition of Fellowship and the extinction of the advowsons belonging to\r\nthe College by the Irish Church Act of 1869, has become a body of men,\r\nthe average age of whom is over seventy and the average time since the\r\ngraduation of whom is a little more than half a century. There is at\r\npresent one Catholic Junior Fellow in the College, and from the above\r\nfacts it will be seen that he may get on the governing board, if he\r\nsurvives, in about forty years from now.\r\n\r\nThe government in a college by men whose undergraduate days were fifty\r\nyears ago is not calculated to inspire hope for a liberality of\r\ntreatment with which a more modern generation might be imbued. The\r\nsuggestion that Catholics show narrowmindedness in refusing to throng\r\nthe halls of a College admittedly envious of its Protestantism and\r\nmaintaining automatically its purely Protestant government for\r\nthree-quarters of a century more is very disingenuous.\r\n\r\nThat if they were to comply, Protestantism would have by some special\r\nmeans to maintain its supremacy is obvious, for the Episcopalian\r\nProtestants are only thirteen per cent. of the population of Ireland,\r\nand if Catholics were to swamp Trinity and to succeed in obtaining a\r\nshare in its councils proportionate to their numbers in the country, the\r\nbody for which Trinity was founded would find themselves unable to\r\nobtain any dominant voice in its government.\r\n\r\n\"Trinity College is quite free from clerical control,\" said the\r\nVice-Provost in his statement to the Commissioners, regardless\r\napparently of the fact that of the seven Senior Fellows who, together\r\nwith the Provost, form the College Board, no less than four are\r\nclergymen. In this connection I cannot do better than quote from the\r\nstatement submitted by the Committee on Higher Education of the General\r\nAssembly of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland for the information of\r\nthe last Royal Commission:--\r\n\r\n\"So long as Trinity College remains practically as it is there is a real\r\ngrievance for all denominations except the Protestant Episcopalian, and\r\nthe members of those denominations will still be able to say that the\r\nbest education in the country--and whether it is the best academically\r\nor simply possesses a greater social acceptance and prestige it is\r\nneedless here to discuss--is withheld from them, except on conditions\r\nthat tempt their sons to abandon the faith of their fathers or to become\r\nweakened in their attachment to it.\"\r\n\r\nNo one--least of all an Irishman--can deny the greatness of a College on\r\nthe boards of which are such names as Berkeley, Swift, Grattan, Flood,\r\nand Burke, but it will be admitted by all that as far as the fame of her\r\n_alumni_ is concerned--and there is no other test for a collegiate\r\nfoundation--Trinity reached the zenith of her greatness during the years\r\nin which a free Parliament served to break down the barriers of religion\r\nin the island. With the passing of that phase of political history she\r\nrelapsed into her place as the \"silent sister\" in the country, but not\r\nof it, taking no part in national life other than to offer opposition to\r\nthe legislative changes, which even she is now constrained to admit were\r\nreforms.\r\n\r\nAs owner of some 200,000 acres, Trinity College has proved herself one\r\nof the worst landlords in Ireland. An estate belonging to the College in\r\nCounty Kerry gave rise to one of the bitterest struggles of the land\r\nwar. In view of the cry which is being raised in England to-day as to\r\nthe broad tolerance which is alleged to hold the field in the College\r\nto-day, the bitterly anti-Catholic spirit of the present Provost and of\r\nhis predecessors deserves mention; but I must further call the reader's\r\nnotice to a recent event which attracted much attention in Ireland, but\r\nwas passed unnoticed in Great Britain. In a sonnet, written by a leading\r\nFellow of the College in \"T.C.D.,\" the College magazine, the writer\r\nspoke of the Catholic churches in Ireland as \"grim monuments of cold\r\nobservance, the incestuous mate of superstition,\" of which \"to seeing\r\neyes each tall steeple lifts its tall head and lies.\" Sentiments of this\r\nkind, expressed in such taste, are not calculated to encourage Catholic\r\nparents to send their sons to a college where they may come under\r\ninfluences of which the writer is an example.\r\n\r\nThe idea of putting into practice the proposed expedient of swamping\r\nTrinity by the encouragement of all Catholics to send their sons to that\r\nCollege is to a member of an old university as attractive as on paper it\r\nappears easy, but there are drawbacks to its practical application other\r\nthan the presence in the College of such a spirit as I have exemplified.\r\n\r\nIn England, where there are public schools, and Oxford and Cambridge\r\ncolleges, many of which have behind them a career of three or four\r\nhundred years, one is inclined to overestimate the value of tradition in\r\na country where educational endowments are rare and ancient endowments\r\nare the exception. The traditions, moreover, of the origin and of the\r\nmission of Trinity are not such as to foster for her the same feelings\r\nas Oxford and Cambridge have the power of provoking in England. The part\r\nwhich Trinity has played in Irish history is in no sense analogous to\r\nthat played by the English Universities in the history of that country.\r\nEnglish Catholics make use of Oxford and Cambridge for the education of\r\ntheir sons because in view of their numbers the notion of a separate\r\nuniversity or even a separate college would be ridiculous. In England\r\nCatholics are a small sect. In Ireland they form the great bulk of the\r\nnation. In Montreal, where Catholics form only forty per cent. of the\r\npopulation, a Catholic University was established by Royal Charter, and\r\nthe same principle has been applied in the establishment of Catholic\r\nUniversities in Nova Scotia, in Malta, in New South Wales, and in the\r\nfounding of the Mahommedan Gordon College at Khartoum.\r\n\r\nAs long as Trinity maintained tests, so long did the Catholics demand as\r\nof right a purely Catholic University on the grounds of civic equity,\r\nbut in these days of open doors they have again and again expressed\r\ntheir demand for a college or university open to men of all\r\ncreeds--Catholic in the sense that Oxford and Cambridge are Protestant,\r\nand are in consequence thronged with young Englishmen; Catholic in the\r\nway that the Scottish Universities are Presbyterian and that Trinity,\r\nDublin, is Episcopalian. Not a rich man's college, but one to which all\r\nmay go as they do to those in Scotland and like those racy of the soil,\r\nand for the rest, in Cardinal Newman's words--\"Not a seminary, not a\r\nconvent, but a place where men of the world may be fitted for the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\nEveryone recognises to-day the grievance of the Dissenters in England\r\nand Wales in single school areas under the Education Act of 1902.\r\nIreland may not unjustly be said to be a single university area, for to\r\ncall an examining Board a university is a misnomer. It is surely not too\r\nmuch to assert that the conscientious scruples of the Irish Catholics to\r\nforms of education of which they do not approve are as strong as the\r\nfeelings of the Non-conformist conscience. The attempt to force\r\nundenominationalism on the country has been an expensive failure.\r\nRecognising this, the denominational--nay, more, the Jesuit--University\r\nCollege has in a niggardly fashion and by a back door been subsidised by\r\nthe State. The demand is for no more than a university which shall be\r\nCatholic in the sense that it shall be national, and this in a\r\npreponderatingly Catholic country implies Catholicism. The Irish\r\nCatholic bishops in 1897 declared they are prepared to accept a\r\nuniversity without tests in which the majority of the governing body\r\nare laymen, with a provision that no State funds should be employed for\r\nthe promotion of religious education. It is idle, in view of this, to\r\nprotest that the demand is urged only on behalf of rampant clericalism,\r\nand that the only form of university which Catholics will accept is of\r\nsuch a kind as would serve to strengthen the hand of the priests, whose\r\nsole aim in this demand is to secure that increase of power. The shifts\r\nof intolerance are many, but I cannot believe that it will long continue\r\nto masquerade in this manner as the statesmanlike buffer between a\r\npriest-ridden country and an aggressive clergy. Granting, for the sake\r\nof argument, that this was the case, one would have thought that a\r\nwell-educated laity was better able than one without education to\r\nwithstand the encroaches of clericalism. We do not ask for a\r\ndenominational college, but remember that the only colleges, Keble and\r\nSelwyn, founded in Oxford and Cambridge in the last eighty years are\r\npurely denominational. In the last forty years six new universities have\r\nbeen founded in England, and the number of university students has risen\r\nfrom 2,300 to 13,000. In Ireland, on the other hand, for three-fourths\r\nof the population knowledge must still remain a fountain sealed; it is\r\nas though one were applying literally to that country the text--\"He that\r\nincreaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.\"\r\n\r\nIn connection with what one may call the Bryce scheme it may be well to\r\npoint out that as long ago as 1871 the hierarchy proposed a solution on\r\nthe same lines. In a Pastoral letter of that year, after insisting on\r\nthe principle of equality, the following passage occurred--\"All this\r\ncan, we believe, be attained by modifying the constitution of the\r\nUniversity of Dublin, so as to admit the establishment of a second\r\nCollege within it, in every respect equal to Trinity College, and\r\nconducted on purely Catholic principles.\"\r\n\r\nOn the motion to go into Committee on the Bill for the abolition of\r\ntests in 1873 an Irish member moved a motion to the effect that a\r\nCatholic College should be founded in the University of Dublin, in\r\naddition to Trinity College. Two years later Mr. Isaac Butt, the\r\nProtestant leader of the Irish Nationalists (himself a Trinity man), and\r\nThe O'Conor Don, a Catholic Unionist, brought in a Bill on the same\r\nlines, but both motion and Bill were defeated. The advantages of this\r\nmode of dealing with the question are seen from its acceptance by the\r\nhierarchy and the general mass of the Catholic laity. The Senate of the\r\nRoyal University have since its promulgation readily recognised its\r\nsoundness and have given it their support, as have the Professors of\r\nUniversity College, Dublin. It will serve to make an end of the\r\nunderhand manner by which, as we have seen, that College, though not\r\nmerely a denominational, but, moreover, a Jesuit institution, is\r\nsubsidised by public money, though we are always told that State\r\nendowment of religious education is alien to all modern principles of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nOne would have thought that the authorities of Trinity would have felt\r\nthemselves estopped from refusing to accept this solution. The offer of\r\nfacilities inside Trinity itself--if it is the generous concession it\r\nprofesses to be--must be made with a full recognition that, if accepted,\r\nthe process of \"capturing\" the College would be effected before long,\r\nthus modifying the Protestantism which is its proudest boast. If, on the\r\nother hand, the expense of life in Trinity College would prove\r\nprohibitive to any but a small section of the four thousand matriculated\r\nstudents in the Royal University, the much-vaunted liberality of Trinity\r\nis seen to be very greatly restricted, since the results of acceptance\r\nof the offer would only touch the mere fringe of the educational demand.\r\n\r\nLast year, of the 1,114 students on the books of the College only 261\r\nwere resident within the College--there being accommodation for only\r\n275. Of the 853 returned as residing outside the College, more than a\r\nhundred do not attend lectures or classes, and are entitled to call\r\nthemselves members of the College though their only connection with it\r\nis in the examination hall--an evil system which the Commission has\r\ncondemned, and which one must suppose was borrowed from the Royal\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\nEveryone is agreed that a university to be worth the name should, if\r\npossible, be residential. The absence of disciplinary control in Trinity\r\non those residing out of College, the omission on the part of the\r\nauthorities to enact rules which would allow terms to be kept only in\r\nlicensed lodging-houses, subject to inspection and to a rigid \"lock-up\r\nrule\" at twelve o'clock, are absent in Dublin not only at Trinity, but\r\nat the University College, where one can only suppose its absence to be\r\ndue to the unorganised condition of a small and temporary makeshift. Not\r\nonly, however, for the exercise of disciplinary control, but also\r\nbecause of the close association of men with each other which residence\r\nensures, is this to be regarded as the best means of getting the heart\r\nout of a university education.\r\n\r\nThis being the case, if Trinity were to receive a new accession of\r\nnumbers its accommodation would have to be largely increased, so that\r\nthe line of least resistance, which leaves the very largely autonomous\r\nconstitution of Trinity unimpaired, will be seen to lie in the direction\r\nof the establishment of a new college, in which, moreover, it will be\r\npossible to make expenses more economical than they are in Trinity.\r\n\r\n\"It is not for us,\" said Mr. Balfour at Partick in December, 1889, \"to\r\nconsider how far the undoubtedly conscientious objections of the Roman\r\nCatholic population to use the means at their disposal are wise or\r\nunwise. That is not our business. What we have to do is to consider what\r\nwe can do consistently with our conscience to meet their wants.\"\r\n\r\nThe proposals of the Government, as outlined by Mr. Bryce and\r\nrecommended by the Royal Commission, offend against no one's conscience.\r\nThey assail no vested interest unless one so calls that of which Matthew\r\nArnold spoke as one very cruel result of the Protestant ascendancy; they\r\ntend to establish something approaching equality between creeds; they\r\nmake an end of the mischievous system by which the Royal University has\r\nencouraged a false ideal of success by making examination the end-all\r\nand the be-all of a so-called university education, and which, moreover,\r\naccording to the final report of the Robertson Commission, \"fails to\r\nexhibit the one virtue which is associated with a university of this\r\nkind--that of inspiring public confidence in its examination results.\"\r\nThe advantages of the present proposal over a reorganised Royal\r\nUniversity are that the size and poverty of the country are strong\r\nreasons against the creation of two universities when one would be\r\nequally efficient. The scheme will be readily accepted by the\r\nPresbyterians as well as by the Catholics, which would not be the case\r\nwith a reconstituted Royal University, and it is the only solution of\r\nthe question which will bring the young men of different creeds in the\r\ncountry together at an impressionable age when friendships are formed\r\nwhich may serve to break down the barrier between creeds.\r\n\r\nThe objection of Trinity College to the inclusion on the roll of the\r\nUniversity under the new conditions of the present M.A.s of the Royal\r\nUniversity is scarcely consistent with its recent action in admitting to\r\n_ad eundem_ degrees women who have passed the final degree examinations\r\nat Oxford and Cambridge, and if the objection to the proposal is based\r\non the change in political complexion which the electoral roll of the\r\nUniversity would undergo, the answer is that University representation\r\nis an anomaly which in any circumstances is not likely to continue for\r\nmany years more in the case, not merely of Dublin, but of the other\r\nuniversities of the three kingdoms.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSince the foregoing chapter was written the Provost of Trinity has\r\nannounced to a meeting of Graduates of the College that he has received\r\nassurances from the Chief Secretary that in the forthcoming Bill the\r\nUniversity of Dublin will be left untouched. I have said enough to show\r\nthat Irish Nationalist opinion has not been committed to the Bryce\r\nscheme to the exclusion of every other solution, but it is to be\r\nregretted, in the interests of education, that the proposal which the\r\nmajority of Irishmen regarded as the solution nearest approaching the\r\nideal should have been launched by the Government merely as a _ballon\r\nd'essai_, to be withdrawn at the first breath of opposition, and to be\r\nreplaced by what, at the best, can only prove to be a less hopeful\r\ncompromise. One guarantee of a speedy solution the country at any rate\r\nholds--namely, that the Government is pledged to introduce legislation\r\nnext session, and that the Chief Secretary has bound himself to stand or\r\nfall by the fate of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nUNIONISM IN IRELAND\r\n\r\n     \"When I hear any man talk of an unalterable law, the only\r\n     effect it produces upon me is to convince me that he is an\r\n     unalterable fool. There are always a set of worthy and\r\n     moderately gifted men who bawl out death and ruin upon every\r\n     valuable change which the varying aspect of human affairs\r\n     absolutely and imperiously requires ... I admit that to a\r\n     certain extent the Government will lose the affections of the\r\n     Orangemen ... but you must perceive that it is better to have\r\n     four friends and one enemy than four enemies and one friend.\"\r\n\r\n     --SYDNEY SMITH, _Letters of Peter Plymley_, 1807.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the outcry which arose in the last years of the late Government at\r\nthe revelations which came to be known as the MacDonnell mystery one\r\nwould have thought that Conservatives could look back to a record\r\nunstained by any traffic with the unclean thing for which they express\r\nsuch horror. I will try to show how small is the measure of truth in\r\nthis belief, and in what manner it has proved impossible to maintain the\r\n_status quo_ in the teeth of democratic feeling without _pourparlers_\r\nbehind the scenes, even when in the open such dealings have had perforce\r\nto be denounced as impossible.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five years ago the rigid application of the Crimes Act by Lord\r\nSpencer, the Viceroy, after the Phoenix Park murders had put an end to\r\nthe \"Kilmainham Treaty,\" and the failure on the part of the Government\r\nto amend the Land Act of 1881, together with the sympathetic attitude of\r\nLord Randolph Churchill, then conducting his guerilla tactics as leader\r\nof the Fourth Party, all served to make opposition on the part of the\r\nIrish members to the Liberal Government increase, and it was by their\r\naid that in June, 1885, it was thrown out of office on a defeat by\r\ntwelve votes on the Budget. Lord Salisbury then took office with his\r\n\"ministry of care-takers,\" with a minority in the House of Commons, for\r\na general election could not take place until the provisions of the new\r\nFranchise Act had come into force.\r\n\r\nColour was lent to the general impression which was abroad that the\r\nConservatives were flirting with Home Rule by the appointment to the\r\nLord Lieutenancy with a seat in the Cabinet of Lord Carnarvon, the\r\nstatesman who had established federation in Canada and had attempted to\r\nbring it about in South Africa, who was familiar with the machinery of\r\nsubordinate legislatures and Colonial parliaments, and whose sympathies\r\nwith the Irish people were to be inferred from the fact that he had\r\nvoted for Disestablishment in 1869, and for the Land Bill of the\r\nfollowing year, in a speech on which measure he had urged the House of\r\nLords not to delay concession till it could no longer have the charm of\r\nfree consent, nor be regulated by the counsels of prudent statesmanship.\r\n\r\nThe defeat of the Liberals had been primarily due to the revolt on the\r\npart of the radical section over the question of whether a new Coercion\r\nBill should be introduced. In the light of this fact special importance\r\nwas attached to the declaration, made in the House of Lords, as to the\r\nIrish policy of the Government, the more so because in an unprecedented\r\nmanner not the Premier but the Viceroy was the spokesman. He began by a\r\nrepudiation of coercion, with which he declared the recent\r\nenfranchisement of the Irish people would not be consistent. \"My Lords,\"\r\nhe went on to say, speaking of the general question, \"I do not believe\r\nthat with honesty and singlemindedness of purpose on the one side, and\r\nwith the willingness of the Irish people on the other, it is hopeless to\r\nlook for some satisfactory solution of this terrible question. My\r\nLords, these I believe to be the opinions and views of my colleagues.\"\r\n\r\nA further step in securing Irish support occurred at the end of July,\r\nand perhaps of all the strange events which have occurred in the\r\ngovernment of Ireland it is the strangest. Lord Carnarvon solicited\r\nthrough one of his colleagues, and obtained, an interview with Mr.\r\nParnell, and the circumstances under which this occurred between the\r\nQueen's Lord Lieutenant and the leader to whom men attributed treason\r\nand condoning assassinations is perhaps the most curious part of the\r\nwhole story.\r\n\r\nThe meeting took place at the very end of the London season, not in the\r\nHouses of Parliament nor in a club of which one or other of the parties\r\nwas a member, but in an empty house in Grosvenor Square, from which all\r\nthe servants had gone away. It is a piquant feature of the event,\r\nshrouded as it was with all these circumstances of mystery, that the\r\ngentleman who was in the secret and offered his house for the meeting\r\nwas no other than that rigid Imperialist, Col. Sir Howard Vincent, who\r\nhad only the year before retired from the Criminal Investigation\r\nDepartment at Scotland Yard. When the occurrence of this interview\r\nbecame known, nearly a year later, Mr. Parnell declared--and the fact\r\nwas never denied by Lord Carnarvon--that the latter had pronounced\r\nhimself in favour of an Irish Parliament with the power of protecting\r\nIrish industries. The insistence by the Viceroy that he spoke only for\r\nhimself appeared to the Irish leader to be mere formality, but in truth\r\nthe Cabinet knew nothing of the interview. Lord Salisbury was informed\r\nthat it was going to take place, raised no objection to its occurrence,\r\nand on receiving afterwards, both _verbatim_ and in writing, accounts of\r\nwhat had occurred, praised the discretion of his Viceroy.\r\n\r\nIn view of what had happened it was not surprising that in the month of\r\nAugust Mr. Parnell made an explicit demand for the restoration of\r\nGrattan's Parliament, with the right of taxing foreign and even English\r\nimports for the benefit of the Irish home trade--a proposal not so\r\nrevolutionary as it would now appear, seeing that less than forty years\r\nhad elapsed since the Irish Custom House had for the first time begun to\r\nadmit all English goods duty free.\r\n\r\nMr. Parnell's manifesto was followed by Lord Salisbury's speech at\r\nNewport, from which quotation has already been made, in which he\r\nexpressed himself of opinion that Home Rule would be safer than popular\r\nlocal government, and further enhanced the impression that he was moving\r\nin the direction of the safer policy, by proceeding to frame what has\r\nbeen described as the nearest approach to an apologia for boycotting\r\nwhich has ever been made by an English statesman. The election address\r\nof Lord Randolph Churchill--the most popular and influential minister in\r\nthe country--contained no allusion to the threatened \"dismemberment of\r\nthe Empire,\" and in his campaign his only allusion to Ireland was\r\ncomprised in boasts of the success of the anti-coercion policy of\r\nCarnarvon; while Sir John Gorst, who had been Solicitor-General,\r\nreferred in his election address in disparaging terms to \"the\r\nreactionary Ulster members.\" All the symptoms pointed in the one\r\ndirection of an alliance between Salisbury and Parnell on the basis of a\r\nscheme for self-government, and an additional point was given to the\r\nindications in that direction by the fact that Mr. Chamberlain and Lord\r\nHartington, at variance on most points of policy, were united in\r\nopposition to Mr. Parnell's demand.\r\n\r\nThe statesmanlike manner in which at this juncture Mr. Gladstone\r\nendeavoured, as he himself put it, to keep the strife of nations from\r\nforming the dividing line between parties, has become very apparent with\r\nthe recent publication of documents of the period. Two years before, he\r\nhad told the Queen that the Irish question could only be settled by a\r\nconjunction of parties, and on December 20th, 1885, he wrote to the\r\nConservative leader on the urgency of the Irish question, and declared\r\nthat it would be a public calamity if this great subject should fall\r\ninto lines of party conflict. If Salisbury would bring forward a\r\nproposal for settling the whole question of future government in Ireland\r\nhe would treat it in the same spirit as that which he had shown in the\r\nmatters of Afghanistan and the Balkans, and he illustrated the\r\nadvantages which such a spirit of concession could produce by the\r\nconferences on the Reform Bill, and the fact that the existing\r\nConservative ministry had been maintained in office by Liberal\r\nforbearance. \"His hypocrisy,\" wrote a minister to whom this letter had\r\nbeen shown, \"makes me sick.\" In this connection a letter from Lord\r\nRandolph Churchill to Lord Salisbury, written on the following day, is\r\nof interest:--\r\n\r\n\"Labouchere came to see me this morning.... He proceeded to tell me\r\nthat, on Sunday week last, Lord Carnarvon had met Justin MacCarthy and\r\nhad confided to him that he was in favour of Home Rule in some shape,\r\nbut that his colleagues and his party were not ready, and asked whether\r\nJustin MacCarthy's party would agree to an inquiry which he thought\r\nthere was a chance of the Government agreeing to, and which would\r\neducate his colleagues and his party if granted and carried through. I\r\nwas consternated, but replied that such a statement was an obvious lie,\r\nbut, between ourselves, I fear it is not, perhaps not even an\r\nexaggeration or a misrepresentation. Justin MacCarthy is on the staff of\r\nthe _Daily News_, Labouchere is one of the proprietors, and I cannot\r\nimagine any motive for his inventing such a statement. If it is true\r\nLord Carnarvon has played the devil.\"[21]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the overtures which Mr. Gladstone had made, for which\r\nprecedents in plenty were supplied by the repeal of the Test Act in\r\n1828, Catholic Emancipation in 1829, the Repeal of the Corn Laws in\r\n1848, and the extension of the franchise in 1867, Lord Salisbury saw in\r\nit only anxiety to take office on the part of his great opponent, and\r\nprophesied that if his hunger were not prematurely gratified he would be\r\nforced into some line of conduct which would be discreditable to him and\r\ndisastrous, and when the Liberal leader on the 23rd again pressed for a\r\ndefinite answer to his approaches he was refused a communication of\r\nviews.\r\n\r\n\"Thus idly,\" says Mr. Winston Churchill, \"drifted away what was perhaps\r\nthe best hope of the settlement of Ireland which that generation was to\r\nsee.\"\r\n\r\nThe view which Mr. Gladstone took of the events of the winter of 1885-6\r\nis illustrated by a memorandum which he wrote in 1897, in which he\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n\"I attached value to the acts and language of Lord Carnarvon and the\r\nother favourable manifestations. Subsequently we had but too much\r\nevidence of a deliberate intention to deceive the Irish with a view to\r\ntheir support at the election.\"[22]\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the Tories and the rankling memory of the bitter debates\r\non the Liberal Coercion Bill of 1882, coupled with the attitude of the\r\nTories and the deception which they practised, resulted, not\r\nunnaturally, in the fact that Parnell threw his weight in favour of the\r\nConservatives at the general election which ensued, and by this means,\r\nit is estimated, lost at least twenty seats to the Liberals. Immediately\r\nafter the election the Viceroy and the Chief Secretary retired, but\r\nthough their successors were appointed in the third week in December, it\r\nwas not till the middle of January that the resignations were made\r\npublic. The first act of the new Chief Secretary was to announce that,\r\nin spite of the emphatic disclaimers of the previous June, a Coercion\r\nBill was to be introduced, and as a result of the Irish voting with the\r\nLiberals the Tories were defeated, and Mr. Gladstone took office. The\r\nHome Rule Bill which was introduced was thrown out in the month of June,\r\nthe Government being in a minority of thirty. Had it not been for\r\nParnell's manifesto, urging Irishmen in Great Britain to vote for\r\nConservatives, the Government would have had a majority of between ten\r\nand twenty, and, moreover, if a general election had followed, the\r\nmorale of the Liberals would have been much greater if they had been\r\nfighting for the second time within a few months shoulder to shoulder\r\nwith the Irishmen, and not been in the position in which in fact they\r\nwere--of enjoying the support in June of those who had opposed them in\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\nLet us now turn to the MacDonnell incident. One of the first acts of Mr.\r\nBalfour, on becoming Prime Minister in July, 1902, on the retirement of\r\nLord Salisbury was to give Mr. Wyndham, the Chief Secretary, a seat in\r\nthe Cabinet. In September Mr. Wyndham appointed as Under Secretary Sir\r\nAntony MacDonnell, a distinguished Indian Civil Servant and Member of\r\nthe Indian Council, who had been in turn head of the Government of\r\nBurma, the Central Provinces, and the North-West Provinces, and who had\r\nwith conspicuous ability carried on financial and agrarian reforms in\r\nthe East. Lord Lansdowne, during his tenure of the Viceroyalty, formed a\r\nhigh estimate of his knowledge and ability, and it was on his\r\nrecommendation that Mr. Wyndham appointed this official to the post. The\r\ncorrespondence between the two, which Mr. Redmond elicited from the\r\nGovernment two and a half years later, shows that it was with some\r\nreluctance that the Under Secretary yielded to the pressure brought to\r\nbear on him to accept the office.\r\n\r\n\"I am an Irishman, a Roman Catholic, and a Liberal in politics,\" he\r\nwrote. \"I have strong Irish sympathies. I do not see eye to eye with you\r\nin all matters of Irish administration, and I think that there is no\r\nlikelihood of good coming from such a _régime_ of coercion as the\r\n_Times_ has recently outlined.\" For all that, being anxious to do some\r\nservice to Ireland, he declared his willingness to take office provided\r\nthere was some chance of his succeeding, which he thought there would\r\nbe, \"on this condition, that I should have adequate opportunities of\r\ninfluencing the policy and acts of the Irish administration, and\r\nsubject, of course, to your control, freedom of action in Executive\r\nmatters. For many years in India I directed administration on the\r\nlargest scale, and I know that if you send me to Ireland the opportunity\r\nof mere secretarial criticism would fall short of the requirements of my\r\nposition. If I were installed in office in Ireland my aims, broadly\r\nstated, would be:--(1) The maintenance of order; (2) the solution of the\r\nland question on the basis of voluntary sale; (3) where sale does not\r\noperate the fixation of rent on some self-acting principle whereby local\r\ninquiries would be obviated; (4) the co-ordination, control, and\r\ndirection of boards and other administrative bodies; (5) the settlement\r\nof the education question in the general spirit of Mr. Balfour's views,\r\nand generally the promotion of general administrative improvement and\r\nconciliation.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Wyndham's acceptance of these terms was explicit, and it was\r\nunderstood, as the Chief Secretary put it in the House of Commons when\r\nthe whole subject came up for review, that Sir Antony was appointed\r\nrather as a colleague than as a mere Under Secretary to register Mr.\r\nWyndham's will, and although in the House of Commons Mr. Balfour said\r\nthat Sir Antony was bound by the rules applying to all Civil Servants,\r\nin the House of Lords Lord Lansdowne declared that, \"it had been\r\nrecognised that the Under Secretary would have greater freedom of\r\naction, greater opportunities of initiative, than if he had been a\r\ncandidate in the ordinary way.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the first results of the new departure was the withdrawal of the\r\napplication of the Coercion Act, which had been in force since April,\r\n1902, an action which roused angry protests from the Orangemen, as did\r\nalso the words used, in what was almost his first speech, by Lord\r\nDudley, the new Viceroy, who had succeeded Lord Cadogan, and who\r\nannounced that, \"the opinion of the Government was, and it was his own\r\nopinion, that the only way to govern Ireland properly was to govern it\r\naccording to Irish ideas instead of according to British ideas.\"\r\n\r\nDuring 1903 interest was largely engrossed in the fate of the Land Act,\r\nand it was not till the autumn of 1904 that it became known that before\r\ndrafting in its final form the programme of the Irish Reform Association\r\nLord Dunraven had secured the assistance of the Under Secretary with the\r\nknowledge of the Chief Secretary and the Viceroy, the latter of whom,\r\naccording to Lord Lansdowne's declaration in the House of Lords, \"did\r\nnot think that Sir Antony was exceeding his functions\"--a fact to which\r\ncolour was given by the circumstance that on several occasions the Under\r\nSecretary discussed the reforms with the Lord Lieutenant.\r\n\r\nMr. Wyndham, on behalf of the Government, had taken the unusual course\r\nof repudiating the Dunraven scheme in a letter to the _Times_, but in\r\nspite of this, Irish Unionists wrote to the _Times_ to express their\r\nsuspicions \"whether in short the devolution scheme is not the price\r\nsecretly arranged to be paid for the Nationalist acquiescence in a\r\nsettlement of the land question on generous terms.\"\r\n\r\nThen it was that the _Times_ expressed its opinion that when a Unionist\r\nLord Lieutenant and a Unionist Under Secretary are discussing reforms\r\nwhich the Cabinet condemn as Home Rule in a thin disguise, it is\r\nobviously time that they quitted their posts. Three weeks later Mr.\r\nWyndham resigned, but Sir Antony, who had had the refusal of the\r\nGovernorship of Bombay--the third greatest Governorship in the British\r\nEmpire--retained his position, though his presence at Dublin Castle had\r\nbeen described by some fervent Orangemen as a menace to the loyal and\r\nlaw-abiding inhabitants of Ireland, and by the Irish Attorney-General as\r\na gross betrayal of the Unionist position and an injury to the Unionist\r\ncause. Mr. Long, however, very rapidly won the hearts of those who had\r\nsucceeded in securing the resignation of Mr. Wyndham by his description\r\nof devolution as \"a cowardly surrender to the forces of disorder,\" and\r\nin the same strain the Earl of Westmeath spoke of \"truckling to\r\ndisloyalty and trying to conciliate those who will not be conciliated.\"\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the session of 1905 the whole question was ventilated.\r\nThe official explanations proving unsatisfactory, the Orangemen decided\r\nto withdraw their support from the Government on all questions affecting\r\nIreland, and the leader of the party went so far as to utter the threat\r\nthat \"Ulster might have to draw upon her reserves,\" which was taken to\r\nmean that the Orangemen who were members of the Government would resign\r\n_en masse_--an action which, in the moribund condition of the Ministry,\r\nwould have meant an instant dissolution. At the very beginning of the\r\nsession Mr. Wyndham had announced that the matter of Sir Antony's\r\ndealings with Lord Dunraven had been considered by the Cabinet, and \"the\r\nGovernment expressed through me their view that the action of Sir Antony\r\nMacDonnell was indefensible. But they authorised me to add that they\r\nwere thoroughly satisfied that his conduct was not open to the\r\nimputation of disloyalty.\"\r\n\r\nThe equivocal and ambiguous position in which the Unionists placed\r\nthemselves in the course of this episode is a striking commentary on the\r\nimpossibility of governing a country against its will. The Tories tried\r\nonce again, in the historic phrase, to catch the Whigs bathing and steal\r\ntheir clothes, but this time they failed. When the Orangemen held a\r\npistol at the Government's head and bade its members stand and deliver,\r\nMr. Wyndham had perforce to resign, but the mystery, which has not yet\r\nbeen cleared up, is the reason why the Viceroy and the Under Secretary,\r\nwho were tarred with the same brush, retained their posts.\r\n\r\nIt should in frankness be stated, however, that when during the session\r\nof 1907 the Prime Minister remarked on a certain occasion that he always\r\nthought Mr. Wyndham resigned the Chief Secretaryship in consequence of\r\ncriticisms from the Orangemen below the gangway on his own side, Mr.\r\nBalfour interrupted with the remark--\"That is a complete mis-statement,\r\nand I think the right honourable gentleman must know it.\"\r\n\r\nOne may well ask, in view of this, what was meant by Mr. Wyndham when,\r\nspeaking on the reasons for his retirement, on May 9th, 1905, he\r\naccounted for it by the fact that \"the situation in Ireland was\r\ncomplicated by personal misunderstandings,\" producing \"an atmosphere of\r\nsuspicion,\" which was an obvious reference, as most people supposed, to\r\nsuch denunciations as that of Mr. William Moore of the Chief Secretary's\r\n\"wretched, rotten, sickening policy of conciliation.\" The\r\ndisingenuousness marking the whole proceeding is well shown by the fact\r\nthat although on announcing Mr. Wyndham's resignation Mr. Balfour\r\nsaid:--\"The ground of his resignation is not ill-health,\"[23] less than\r\na year later, when asked during the election at Manchester by a heckler\r\nto state the reason why Mr. Wyndham retired, the reply of Mr. Balfour\r\nwas--\"He retired chiefly on account of health.\"[24]\r\n\r\nFrom the correspondence which passed in March, 1906, between Lord Dudley\r\nand Sir Edward Carson, and which was published in the Press, we have the\r\nexpress statement from the ex-Lord Lieutenant that Mr. Balfour \"never\r\nconveyed to me any intimation that he or the Government disapproved\r\nstrongly or otherwise of my conduct.\"\r\n\r\nThe correspondence arose over a remark made by Sir Edward Carson, to the\r\neffect that Lord Dudley had made statements both ways as to the\r\ndesirability of governing Ireland according to Irish ideas. Challenged\r\nto make good the assertion, which he declared was based on a private\r\nconversation, Sir Edward Carson went on to assert that the Viceroy had\r\non another occasion expressed the opinion to him that Ireland should be\r\ngoverned through the agency of the Catholic priesthood. This Lord Dudley\r\ndenied as vehemently as he did the imputation of facing both ways, and\r\nin reply went on to write:--\r\n\r\n\"That you should have formed an impression of that kind from any\r\nconversation with me confirms my belief that the violence of your\r\nopinions on Irish political questions make it quite impossible for you\r\nto estimate justly the standpoint of anyone whose views on such\r\nquestions may be more moderate and tolerant than your own. It is not,\r\nhowever, by violence and intolerance that the cause of union is best\r\nserved, and my experience in Ireland has shown me very clearly that the\r\npresent system of government constantly receives from its most clamorous\r\nadvocates blows as heavy and as effective as any that could be dealt to\r\nit by its avowed enemies.\"\r\n\r\nThe Government tried to ride two horses abreast--to rule Ireland\r\notherwise than by force, and to maintain itself in power with the help\r\nof Orange votes--two courses, each irreconcilable with the other. Their\r\nposition reminds me of Alphonse Daudet's immortal creation, Tartarin de\r\nTarascon, with a double nature, partly that of Don Quixote and partly of\r\nSancho Panza, at one moment urged on by the glory, and at the next held\r\nback by the prospect of the hardships, of lion-hunting in\r\nAfrica--\"Couvre toi de gloire,\" dit Tartarin Quichotte, \"Couvre toi de\r\nflanelle dit Tartarin Sancho.\"\r\n\r\nIt is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a\r\ngovernment which does not recognise democratic principles to make any\r\nheadway in the work of amelioration in Ireland. The moral is that those\r\nresponsible for the administration of the country have found themselves\r\nby the force of circumstances, even against their will, driven to apply\r\npopular principles of government in order that they may secure fairness\r\nand efficiency, and my contention that this is so is borne out by the\r\ntwo incidents to which I have referred, in which the Conservatives\r\nescaped only by the skin of their teeth from committing themselves to a\r\npolicy which would have won them the hostility of their Orange allies.\r\n\r\nThe latter have in truth secured their own way to a remarkable extent.\r\nThe promise has not been fulfilled which Mr. Chamberlain made after the\r\nUnionist victory of 1886, to the effect that Lord Salisbury and the\r\nConservative leaders were prepared to consider and review the\r\n\"irritating centralising system of administration which is known as\r\nDublin Castle.\" At the time of the ill-fated Round Table Conference,\r\nwhich Sir William Harcourt convened, Mr. Chamberlain committed himself\r\nto the expediency of establishing some form of legislative authority in\r\nDublin, and admitted that such a body should be allowed to organise the\r\nform of Executive Government on whatever lines it thought fit, and Sir\r\nWest Ridgeway, as Under Secretary, subsequently carried out the behests\r\nof the same Government by outlining a scheme of self-government by means\r\nof Provincial Councils with a partly elected board to control finance.\r\nAll these facts serve to show the injustice--in view of acknowledged\r\nfacts--of the description by the late Attorney-General for Ireland of\r\nthe Wyndham proposals as \"mean and cruel desertion.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no part of the Irish question in respect of which more has been\r\nsaid which is misleading than what is known as the problem of Ulster. I\r\nhave already explained what a misnomer this is. In the Counties of\r\nDonegal, Tyrone, Monaghan, Fermanagh, and Cavan there are more\r\nCatholics than Protestants, while in the Counties of Armagh and Down the\r\nnumbers of the two creeds are almost equally divided. What is known as\r\nthe question of Ulster should in truth be known as that of Belfast, for\r\nit is only in that city and in the adjacent Counties of Antrim and Down\r\nthat the religious question is most acute.\r\n\r\nThe social conditions of the country, which have always been to some\r\nextent, though not to that existing in recent years, agricultural, lead\r\none to seek a cause in the conditions of Land Tenure for the different\r\ndegrees of prosperity pervading the North-East corner of Ulster and the\r\nrest of Ireland. It is impossible to doubt that the Ulster Custom of\r\nTenant Right had an immense effect on the economic status of the\r\nprovince. Under it the system of tenure which held the field in the\r\nother three provinces was replaced by one in which the tenants had\r\nsecurity against arbitrary eviction so long as they paid their rents,\r\nand, in addition, were entitled to sell their interest in the property\r\nto the incoming tenant, and this Tenant Right sold often for as much as\r\nhalf, and sometimes for as much as the full, fee-simple of the holding.\r\nThe sum could be obtained on the tenant voluntarily vacating the holding\r\nor on his being unable to pay the rent, the landlord being entitled to\r\nbe consulted with a view to approval by him of the incoming tenant.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the custom can be recognised in the light of the fact\r\nthat in England, where improvements are effected in nearly every case\r\nnot by the tenant but by the landlord, it has been found necessary,\r\nnevertheless, to give legislative sanction to Tenant Right.\r\n\r\nThis has been effected by the Agricultural Holdings Acts, 1875, 1883,\r\nand 1900, under which tenants are entitled to statutory compensation for\r\nimprovements, whether permanent, as, for example, buildings; for\r\ndrainage purposes; or, as in the case of manure, for the improvement of\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\nThe result of the Ulster Custom on the industry of the Northern\r\ntenant-farmer, who enjoyed a freedom of sale and a fixity of tenure,\r\nand, further, a compensation for improvements long before the tenants of\r\nthe South and West secured these advantages, are impossible to\r\nover-estimate. Again, in considering the relative economic positions of\r\nthe members of the two religions, it is impossible to blink the fact\r\nthat little more than a century has passed since the Irish Catholics\r\nwere treated as helots under a penal code, and that, if they have been\r\nbehind hand in the industrial race, account must be taken of the lead in\r\nthe saddle to which in that way they were subjected. The resulting\r\npreponderance of Protestants among the landed gentry led to a further\r\nfactor in the ostracism which in the past they exercised as employers of\r\nlabour, whether agricultural or industrial, which, besides its direct\r\neffect of breeding and perpetuating sectarian hate, served in an\r\neconomic sense to unfit Catholics for employment, and to persuade those\r\nwho in fact were least unfitted and retained their perceptive faculties,\r\nthat the scope for their energies was to be found only abroad, and so\r\ntended to leave behind a residue of labourers rendered unfit for\r\nemployment as against the time when the prejudice of the richer classes\r\nwas removed. The non-application in the more purely Protestant parts of\r\nUlster of the principles which held the field in other parts of Ireland\r\nmade for prosperity in that province by tending towards an economic\r\ncondition of the labour market, unimpeded by artificial restrictions,\r\narising from religious differences and imposed at the hands of employers\r\nof labour. Another factor in the contentment of the Ulster Presbyterians\r\nunder the varying vicissitudes of Irish government is to be found in the\r\nhistory of the Regium Donum. The Scottish settlers in 1610 having\r\nbrought with them their ministers, the latter were put in possession of\r\nthe tithes of the parishes in which they were planted. These they\r\nenjoyed till the death of Charles I., but payments were stopped on their\r\nrefusal to recognise the Commonwealth. Henry Cromwell, however, allowed\r\nthe body £100, which Charles II. increased to £600, per annum, but\r\ntowards the end of his reign, and during that of James II., it was\r\ndiscontinued. William III. renewed the grant, increasing it to £1,200,\r\nand it was still further augmented in 1785 and 1792. After the Union\r\nCastlereagh largely increased the amount of the Regium Donum, and\r\ncompletely altered its mode of distribution, making it in fact\r\ncontingent on the loyalty of the parson to the Union. The spirit in\r\nwhich it was granted is well shown in a letter in Castlereagh's memoirs,\r\nin which the writer, addressing the Chief Secretary just after the votes\r\nhad been passed by Parliament, declared--\"Never before was Ulster under\r\nthe dominion of the British Crown. It had a distinct moral existence\r\nbefore, and now the Presbyterian ministry will be a subordinate\r\necclesiastical aristocracy, whose feeling will be that of zealous\r\nloyalty, and whose influence on those people will be as purely sedative\r\nwhen it should be, and exciting when it should be, as it was the reverse\r\nbefore.\" Those who blame Pitt for not having carried through his schemes\r\nof concurrent endowment, and who see in his failure to do so, one reason\r\nfor the ill success of his policy of Union, must admit the importance of\r\nthe fact that the Presbyterian clergy were pensioners of the State. A\r\nnotion of the extent to which they were subsidised may be inferred from\r\nthe fact that by the Commutation Clauses of the Church Disestablishment\r\nAct of 1869, the Dissenters secured as compensation for the loss of the\r\nRegium Donum and other payments a sum of £770,000, while the equivalent\r\namount paid in lieu of the Maynooth grant to the Catholics--numbering at\r\nleast eight times as many--amounted to only £372,000.\r\n\r\nIt was Froude who declared that if the woollen and linen industries had\r\nnot been hampered there would now be four Ulsters instead of one. Even\r\nin the days before restrictions were placed on the production of Irish\r\nlinen for the better encouragement of the English trade, the North of\r\nIreland was far ahead of the rest of the country in the matter of\r\nflax-spinning, and this pre-eminence was mainly due to the fact that the\r\nclimate there is more suited to that plant than in other parts of\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nStarting with this advantage, linen was able in that province to survive\r\nthe impositions placed on its production, while in places less favoured\r\nby a suitable climate the industry went to the wall. To assume off-hand,\r\nwithout going into the innumerable causes which effect such movements of\r\ncommerce, that innate thrift was responsible, apart from all other\r\ncauses, for the progress of Belfast is an attitude similar to that of\r\none who should hold that nothing but the stupidity of the East Anglian\r\nyokel has prevented that country from becoming as much a centre of\r\nindustry as is Lancashire, for such a sweeping generalisation would take\r\nno account of other forces at work in the development of the great\r\ncommercial centres of the North as, for example, the fact that the\r\npeculiar conditions of the Lancashire climate are such that the\r\nprocesses of cotton-spinning can be best effected in an atmosphere\r\ncontaining the amount of moisture which there prevails.\r\n\r\nIn Belfast the interdependence of the linen and the ship-building\r\ntrades--in one of which the men, while in the other the women, of many\r\nfamilies are employed--is one of the most powerful instruments of social\r\nprogress. The narrow sea which separates it from Scotland and the\r\ngeographical conformation of Belfast Lough have, moreover, a great\r\nbearing on its prosperity. Independence of Irish railways with their\r\nexcessive freights, crippling by their incidence all export trade, in a\r\ntown like Belfast, nine-tenths of the industrial output of which goes\r\nacross the sea, and the advantage which it has over all other Irish\r\ntowns in its proximity, again independently of Irish railways, to the\r\nLanarkshire, Ayrshire, and Cumberland coalfields, are very important\r\nconsiderations in view of the obstacle which the scarcity of coal is to\r\nall commercial enterprises in the island.\r\n\r\nFinally, it must not be forgotten, in reference to the greatest of the\r\nindustries of the North of Ireland, that a very exceptional impetus was\r\ngiven to the development of the commercial enterprise of Belfast at a\r\ntime which might otherwise have proved a critical period in her\r\nindustrial career, by the fact that the American Civil War caused a\r\nslump in cotton which resulted in the failure of a very large number of\r\nLancashire cotton mills, the place of which was taken by the linen mills\r\nof Belfast, which have profited ever since from the advantage gained in\r\nthat crisis and the growth of their trade which it effected.\r\n\r\nI have said enough, I think, to show that the attempt to foist the blame\r\nfor the backwardness--in an industrial sense--of the rest of the country\r\nas compared with the North-East corner, on the difference of religion,\r\nis to close one's eyes to half a dozen other factors which must in truth\r\nalso be appreciated in order that one may arrive at a proper estimate of\r\nthe real reason for the disparity which undoubtedly exists. The facts\r\nwhich I have mentioned serve to show the unwarrantable nature of the\r\nassumption which accounts for the prosperity of North-East Ulster by\r\nconsiderations of race and religion alone. That several generations of\r\nprogress in the industrial field have had a great effect on the\r\ncharacter of the people of Belfast in respect of thrift, energy, and\r\nindustry I am not concerned to deny, but on what ground in this light is\r\nto be explained the decrease in population of Antrim and Down which has\r\ngone on concurrently with the enormous increase in that of Belfast? That\r\nextrinsic factors such as those of geographical situation have much to\r\ndo with increase of prosperity is well illustrated by the industrial\r\ngrowth of Wexford, with its manufactories of agricultural implements and\r\ndairy machinery, which is largely attributable to the close proximity of\r\nthat town to the coalfields and iron of South Wales.\r\n\r\nAs to the argument that political preoccupation is responsible for\r\nnational backwardness, in the case of Finland the convulsions of a\r\nbitter political agitation have not been found incompatible with an\r\nincrease of wealth and of population.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is germane to ask what the Protestant people of\r\nUlster have done for the rest of the country, and to inquire if, with\r\nall their commercial success, they have been in the van of progress.\r\nThat they have never produced a great leader of men or framer of policy\r\nis a remarkable fact, and to every demand of their fellow-countrymen\r\nthey have answered with a reiterated _non possumus_, backed by threats\r\nof their intentions in case they are ignored, which, in point of fact,\r\nthey have never carried into effect.\r\n\r\nThe Orangemen in turn opposed Emancipation, Tithe Reform, Land Reform,\r\nChurch Disestablishment, the Ballot, Local Government, and the\r\nsettlement of the University question. Their attitude to the Land\r\nConference we have seen elsewhere, and in view of this record one may\r\nask whether or not they deserve Mr. Morley's condemnation as \"an\r\nirreconcilable junto, always unteachable, always wrong.\"\r\n\r\nThat their loyalty is contingent on the maintenance of their ascendancy\r\nand the enforcement of their views, their reception of the Church Act of\r\n1869 well shows, as does also the manner in which in 1886 they\r\nthreatened armed resistance if the Bill to which they were opposed was\r\ncarried. That they submitted to the Church Act without carrying out\r\ntheir threats is a matter of history, and there is at least a strong\r\nprobability that in the latter event a similar effect would have been\r\nwitnessed.\r\n\r\nThe removal of religious tests in the public life of Great Britain has\r\nbeen accomplished so completely that it is difficult for Englishmen to\r\nrealise the extent to which the spirit, if not the letter, of tests at\r\nthis day persists in Ireland.\r\n\r\nWe have recently seen the adjournment of the House of Commons moved by\r\nthe Orangemen because a rate collector in Ballinasloe did not receive\r\nthe appointment to a post for which he applied, and the demands of\r\nCatholics for a due share of position and of influence is denounced as a\r\nclaim for monopoly.\r\n\r\nTo show how much evidence there is to sustain the charge I will quote a\r\nProtestant writer on this question of preferment--\"Three-quarters of the\r\nIrish people,\" she writes, \"are Catholics. Of 23 Lords Lieutenant since\r\n1832 not one has been a Catholic, nor ever by law can be a Catholic, and\r\nonly 3 have been Irishmen, tame Irish, as the word goes in Ireland of\r\nthe denationalised Irishman who has shaken off allegiance to his own\r\npeople. Of 30 Chief Secretaries, almost all English, not one has been a\r\nCatholic. It is not necessary that the Chief Secretary or the Commander\r\nof the Forces should be Protestant, but no Catholic has ever yet been\r\nallowed to fill either of these exalted offices. Of the 173 Irish peers\r\nonly 14 (including Viscount Taafe of Austria) are Catholics, and the 28\r\nrepresentative peers in the House of Lords are all free from the taint\r\nof the religion of the Irish people, and powerful to drive opinion\r\nagainst it. Out of 60 Privy Councillors in Ireland 4 only are Catholics,\r\nand 3 out of 17 judges. Eleven out of the 60 Sub-Commissioners are\r\nCatholics; 7 out of the 21 County Court Judges. The head of the police\r\nis a Protestant. One only of the 36 County Inspectors is a Catholic. Of\r\n170 District Inspectors only 10 are of that faith, and of 65 Resident\r\nMagistrates only 15 are Catholics. If we take the Valuation Offices, the\r\nRegistration Offices, the Inspectorship of Factories, the Board of\r\nWorks, the Woods and Forests, the Ordnance Survey, and any and every\r\npublic department, Protestants hold three places out of four, though\r\nthey are but one-quarter of the whole population. The extreme party, as\r\nwe have seen, have secured no less than seven offices in the Government,\r\nand their followers and friends hold about 90 per cent. of the higher\r\nsalaried posts under the Crown in Ireland.\"[25]\r\n\r\nThe same writer attributes the glaring discrepancy between the figures\r\nwhich have just been quoted and the ratio of Catholics and Protestants\r\nin the population of Ireland to \"a union of Protestant fanaticism and\r\nplace-hunting greed.\" That it is due to any lack of ability among Irish\r\nCatholics I scarcely think anyone will urge, and in this connection an\r\namazing article, which I remember reading in an English paper, is of\r\ninterest. The writer, a Unionist from Ulster, strove to show the manner\r\nin which the influence of the Vatican was making itself felt in English\r\npolitics by pointing to the number of Catholics--mostly Irishmen--who\r\nheld high posts in the British Diplomatic, Civil, Military, and Naval\r\nServices, the presence of whom, which he tried to indicate as a menace,\r\nbut which most Englishmen view with equanimity, shows by contrast the\r\nextent to which a taboo is placed in Ireland on officials who adhere to\r\nthe creed of the majority of their countrymen.\r\n\r\nEnough has been said as to the preference shown to one caste, religious\r\nand political, to explain the reason for the fact that in Ireland the\r\n_soi-disant_ loyalist has become synonymous with place-hunter. If\r\nUnionism in Ireland pervades the richer classes, it does so also in\r\nGreat Britain, but in Ireland the inherent weakness of an established\r\nChurch, by which its prestige and the cachet which it gives, make it a\r\nharbour of refuge for those who wish for advancement, and who think that\r\nif they creep and intrude and climb into the fold they will secure it,\r\nall these are factors, which are present in Dublin, where the\r\nEstablishment is Unionism with Dublin Castle as its cathedral. Social\r\nambition, anxiety for preferment or for an _entree_ into society, are\r\nall at work to bring it to pass that a large amount of wealth and\r\ninfluence are ranged on the side of the Union. It is a damaging\r\nindictment which has been drawn up against the Irish landlords by Mr.\r\nT.W. Russell in his recent book, where he declares of this class, with\r\nwhich he fought side by side against the two Home Rule Bills, that he\r\nhas come to the conclusion, slowly but surely, \"that in pretending to\r\nfight for the Union these men were simply fighting for their own\r\ninterests, that Rent and not Patriotism was their guiding motive,\"[26]\r\nand the same charge was formulated a few years ago by Lord Rossmore, a\r\nformer Grand Master of the Orange Society, when he made a public\r\ndeclaration that the so-called Loyalist minority in Ireland were blindly\r\nfollowing the lead of a few professional politicians, who felt that\r\ntheir salaries and positions depended on the divisions and antipathies\r\nof those who should be working together for the good of their common\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThere is no aspect of the Irish question in regard to which more dust is\r\nthrown in Englishmen's eyes than that which is summed up in the one word\r\ndisloyalty. The prestige of the Crown in Great Britain, where its\r\nfunctions are atrophied to a greater extent than in any other country in\r\nEurope, is one of the most striking features in contemporary English\r\nlife. The loyalty of a nation is chiefly due to associations formed by\r\nevents in its history. The extreme unpopularity of Queen Victoria in\r\nGreat Britain in the earlier years of her reign, which arose from her\r\nretirement as far as possible from public life on the death of the\r\nPrince Consort, completely disappeared with the passage of years, when\r\nher age, her sex, and her private virtues overcame the antipathy which a\r\nvery natural reticence on the part of a grief-stricken widow had\r\naroused throughout Great Britain. The associations connected with the\r\nCrown in Ireland are not many. From the day on which Dutch William beat\r\nEnglish James at the Boyne in circumstances not calculated to arouse the\r\nenthusiasm of Irish Catholics for either the lawful king or the usurper,\r\nno Sovereign set foot in Ireland till George IV. visited the country in\r\n1824. The main function of Ireland as regards the monarchs of that time\r\nwas that its pension list served to provide for the maintenance of Royal\r\nfavourites as to whose income they wished no questions to be asked.\r\nCurran thundered against the Irish pension list as \"containing every\r\nvariety of person, from the excellence of a Hawke or a Rodney to the\r\nbase situation of a lady who humbleth herself that she may be exalted.\"\r\nIn saying this he was understating rather than overstating the case,\r\nsince a very cursory inspection of the State papers will reveal the fact\r\nthat the mistresses and bastards of every English King, from Charles II.\r\nto George II., drew their incomes from the Irish establishment free from\r\nthe inquisitive prying of the English House of Commons. Although George\r\nIII. had no need to conceal any palace scandals in this way, we have\r\nseen how the bigotry of \"an old, mad, blind, despised, and dying king\"\r\npostponed Emancipation for more than a generation, and one of the\r\n\"princes, the dregs of their dull race,\" of whom Shelley went on to\r\nspeak, the Duke of York, declared in the House of Lords in 1825--\"I will\r\noppose the Catholic claims whatever may be my situation in life. So help\r\nme God.\"\r\n\r\nThe respectful reception accorded to Queen Victoria--whose dislike of\r\nIreland was notorious--on the very rare occasions on which she visited\r\nthe country serves to show the absence of hostility to the Crown on the\r\npart of the great mass of the people, but the small number of these\r\nvisits during the course of the longest reign in English history lends\r\npoint to a question asked by Mr. James Bryce in a book published more\r\nthan twenty years ago--Why has the most obvious service a monarch can\r\nrender been so strangely neglected? When the present King visited the\r\nSouth of Ireland as Prince of Wales in 1885, at a time when Mr. Charles\r\nParnell's prestige was at its zenith, he was greeted with the half\r\nhumorous sally--\"We will have no Prince but Charley,\" which at any rate\r\ncontrasts favourably with the shouts of \"Popish Ned,\" which his alleged\r\nsympathy with the popular side evoked on his visit a few years later to\r\nLondonderry.\r\n\r\nThe trivial fact that the English National Anthem was drowned at the\r\ndegree day of the Royal University a few years ago by the fact that the\r\nstudents insisted on singing \"God Save Ireland\" at the end of a ceremony\r\nwhich even in the decorous surroundings of the Sheldonian and the Senate\r\nHouse is marked by a large amount of disrespectful licence, nevertheless\r\nprovided the _Times_ and the Unionist Press in general, for several days\r\nwith a text upon which they hung their leading articles in the\r\nexploitation of their favourite theme, but no attention has been drawn\r\nin these quarters to the periodical threat of Orange exponents of a\r\ncontingent loyalty to \"throw the Crown into the Boyne\" as a protest\r\nagainst the various assaults which have been made upon their prerogative\r\nby Parliament, and no mention was made in the English Press of the fact\r\nthat on the day of the postponement of the coronation, owing to the\r\nillness of the King, the organ of the \"disloyalists\"--the _Freeman's\r\nJournal_--ended its leading article with the words \"God Save the King,\"\r\nwhich were a mere expression of the feelings of the bulk of its readers.\r\n\r\nLoyalty, said Swift, is the foible of the Irish people, and it is a\r\nremarkable fact, in spite of the detestable insult to their religious\r\nviews which the law exacts from the Sovereign at his accession, that the\r\npopular welcome accorded to his Majesty, on the part of individuals,\r\nshould remove any ground for the suggestion that the Crown, which\r\nGrattan always declared was an Imperial Crown, is viewed with any animus\r\nin Ireland.\r\n\r\nThat public bodies as such refuse to offer addresses of welcome is due\r\nto a conviction that to do so would be interpreted as an abdication of\r\nthe popular position, an acquiescence in the _status quo_, a recognition\r\nof the system of government of which the Sovereign is head; and it must\r\nnot be forgotten in this connection that, if the Sovereign is neutral,\r\nhis representative in Ireland is a strong party man, and that the\r\ntendency which his Majesty has so strongly deprecated in England on more\r\nthan one occasion, of employing emblems of royalty as symbols of party,\r\nhas been ineradicably established by the ascendancy faction in Ireland,\r\nwhere the Union Jack is a party badge and God Save the King has been\r\nmonopolised as a party song.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nIRELAND AND DEMOCRACY\r\n\r\n     \"A majority of Irish members turned the balance in favour of\r\n     the great Reform Bill of 1832, and from that day there has\r\n     been scarcely a democratic measure which they have not\r\n     powerfully assisted. When, indeed, we consider the votes which\r\n     they have given, the principles they have been the means of\r\n     introducing into English legislation, and the influence they\r\n     have exercised upon the tone and character of the House of\r\n     Commons, it is probably not too much to say that their\r\n     presence in the British Parliament has proved the most\r\n     powerful of all agents in accelerating the democratic\r\n     transformation of English politics.\"\r\n\r\n     --W.E.H. LECKY, _History of England in the Eighteenth\r\n     Century_, Vol. VIII., p. 483.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Ireland perhaps more than in most countries history repeats itself.\r\nThe lament of Lord Anglesea, the Lord Lieutenant, in 1831, who, finding\r\nhimself a _roi faineant_, declared that \"Things are now come to that\r\npass that the question is whether O'Connell or I shall govern Ireland,\"\r\nfound its echo just fifty years later when Parnell enjoyed so powerful a\r\nposition that writers were fain to draw a contrast between the coroneted\r\nimpotence of the head of the Executive and the uncrowned power of the\r\nIrish leader.\r\n\r\nThe history of Irish representation at Westminster is one of the most\r\ncurious chapters in Parliamentary annals. It is only in the last thirty\r\nyears that it has reached the importance which it now possesses,\r\nalthough of all Liberal Governments since the great Reform Bill, that of\r\n1880 and that which is in power to-day are the only two which have had a\r\nmajority independently of the Irish vote, and it is worth remembering\r\nthat the Ministry of 1880 ended its career amid the pitfalls of an Irish\r\nCoercion Bill. The maxim to beware when all men speak well of you,\r\nthere has been no need to impress on Irish members since the days of\r\nParnell, as there was at the time when under Butt's leadership a\r\npunctilious observance of Parliamentary procedure earned for the Irish\r\nrepresentatives a contumelious respect which laughed their demands out\r\nof court.\r\n\r\nIf Parnell had not set out with the deliberate intention of making\r\nIreland stink in the nostrils of the respectable English gentlemen who\r\nthronged the benches of the finest club in London, the protest against\r\nmisgovernment would have taken the form of violence in Ireland and not\r\nof obstruction in the House of Commons. The orderly debates of Butt's\r\ntime were as unproductive in showing the Irish representatives to be in\r\nearnest as were the wholesale suspensions of the later _régime_\r\nprofitable, and if proof of this be needed it is to be found in the fact\r\nthat in 1877 there were but eight English Home Rulers in the House of\r\nCommons, and that to attempt to secure reforms was to knock one's head\r\nagainst a stone wall. Speaking of the Irish representation in 1880 Mr.\r\nGladstone made this solemn declaration:--\"I believe a greater calumny, a\r\nmore gross and injurious statement, could not possibly be made against\r\nthe Irish nation. We believe we are at issue with an organised attempt\r\nto override the free will and judgment of the Irish nation.\" That bubble\r\nwas pricked after the Franchise Act of 1885, when Parnell returned to\r\nthe House of Commons with nearly twenty more followers than he had had\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThere is a quotation of Blackstone's from Lord Burghley to the effect\r\nthat England could never be ruined but by a Parliament, and Englishmen\r\nmust admit that they have paid a price, though by no means as we think\r\ntoo dearly, for insisting on the maintenance in their chamber, under\r\nexisting conditions of a foreign body against its will and admittedly\r\nhostile to the traditions of which they are so proud. The closure,\r\nwhich Lord Randolph Churchill used to pronounce with elaborate emphasis\r\nas _clôture_, the curtailment of the rights of private members, the\r\ngrowth in the power of the Cabinet, and _pari passu_ the loss in power\r\non the part of the House, all these are instances of the way in which\r\nthe sand in the bearings has been able to thwart the Parliamentary\r\nmachine. \"If we cannot rule ourselves,\" said Parnell in 1884, \"we can,\r\nat least, cause them to be ruled as we choose.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of the odium which it entailed, Parnell, once he had \"taken his\r\ncoat off,\" maintained this attitude regardless of the feelings it\r\nevoked, which are perhaps as well expressed as anywhere in a letter of\r\nLord Salisbury to Lord Randolph Churchill when he declared \"the\r\ninstinctive feeling of an Englishman is to wish to get rid of an\r\nIrishman,\" to which one may reply--\"What! did the hand then of the\r\nPotter shake?\"\r\n\r\nThough abuse of the plaintiff's attorney has been indulged in so often,\r\nneither English party has scorned, as from its expressions one would\r\nhave expected, to make use of the Irish vote when its own career has\r\nbeen in danger. The appeals which in spite of this one sees addressed at\r\nintervals to the Irish leaders to abandon their attitude of _Nolo\r\nepiscopari_ and take Ministerial office, for which some, at any rate, of\r\ntheir number have by their ability been conspicuously fitted, is to\r\nignore the fundamental protest on which this self-denying ordnance\r\ndepends. The protest against the _status quo_ has been traditionally\r\nmade in this manner; to waive it would be tantamount to an abdication of\r\nthe claims which have been so consistently made. To accept office might\r\nbe to curry favour with one party or the other, but its\r\nrefusal--especially as compared with its acceptance by the Irish\r\nUnionists--does much to deprive the enemy of the occasion to suggest\r\nsordid motives as reasons for the continuance of the Parliamentary\r\nagitation.\r\n\r\nIn urging his great reform, Lord Durham was wont to lay great stress on\r\nthe evil effect of the English party system on Canadian politics. The\r\nparty system in Great Britain acts as a corrective and an adjusting\r\nmechanism to a degree which is never known in Ireland, where the\r\nprinciple of government with consent of the governed has only been\r\napplied to one corner of the island.\r\n\r\nThe supreme example of so many, in which concessions have been made to\r\nIreland in times of public danger, which had been obstinately refused in\r\ntimes of public security is that of Emancipation, concerning which Peel\r\nin June, 1828, reaffirmed his determination never to surrender, but in\r\nJanuary, 1829, on the ground that five-sixths of the infantry force of\r\nthe three kingdoms was engaged in police work in Ireland, introduced the\r\nBill which obtained the Royal consent in circumstances such as to rob it\r\nof its grace and to make gratitude impossible. I am not, however, here\r\nconcerned with emancipation as such, but with the set-off for its\r\nconcession, under which on the principle of taking away with one hand,\r\nwhile giving with the other, the forty shilling freeholders, who had\r\nreturned O'Connell at the Clare election, were disfranchised to the\r\nnumber of 200,000, and in this way was gilded the pill for the purpose\r\nof placating the English governing classes. The same principle was\r\nfollowed in 1841, when the Corporations of Ireland were thrown open to\r\nCatholics, for out of some sixty-five all except ten or eleven were\r\nabolished. The results of the disfranchising clauses of the Act of 1829\r\nare to be seen in the fact that in 1850, while in England the electors\r\nwere twenty-eight per cent. of the adult male population, in Ireland\r\nthey were only two per cent. A Bill introduced in that year would, if it\r\nhad passed into law, have raised the percentage in Ireland to fifteen.\r\nThe Lords amendments altered the percentage to eight, and in its final\r\nform it was left at about ten. Instead of imposing an £8 rental\r\nqualification one of £12 was imposed, and by this means were excluded\r\n900,000 voters who would have secured the suffrage under the lower\r\nqualification. Speaking of the Franchise, Mr. Lecky, in \"Democracy and\r\nLiberty,\" declared that--\"The elements of good government must be sought\r\nfor in Ireland, on a higher electoral plane than in England.\" This is a\r\nmatter of opinion, and I find it interesting to reflect that the ablest\r\nConservative of my acquaintance--a Tory of the school of Lord Eldon--has\r\non several occasions expressed to me a deliberate opinion in exact\r\ncontradiction of this, to the effect that owing to the relative mental\r\ncalibres of the races there is need of a higher franchise qualification\r\nin England than in either Ireland or Scotland. Speculations of this\r\nkind, however, are unprofitable, seeing that the competency of the Irish\r\npeasants as citizens has been acknowledged by the grant of a wide\r\nhousehold suffrage safeguarded by a careful system of ballot.\r\n\r\nWhen the last great extension of the franchise to householders in the\r\ncountry was made in 1884 there were those who asserted that its\r\napplication to Ireland would be folly. Mr. W.H. Smith, the leader of the\r\nConservatives in the House of Commons, declared that any extension of\r\nthe suffrage in Ireland would lead to \"confiscation of property, ruin of\r\nindustry, withdrawal of capital, misery, wretchedness, and war\"; the\r\nleading Whig statesman said the concession to Ireland of equal electoral\r\nprivileges with those of England would be folly, but in spite of these\r\ngloomy prognostications the omission of Ireland from the scope of the\r\nAct was not proposed by Conservative statesmen, and Lord Hartington\r\nhimself undertook the duty of moving the second reading of a Bill\r\ncontaining provisions which a few weeks before he had described as most\r\nunwise. By this Act the enfranchised inhabitants of Ireland were\r\nmultiplied more than threefold, and the share of Ireland of the \"two\r\nmillion intelligent voters\" who were added to the electorate was\r\n200,000. In the redistribution of seats which accompanied the Franchise\r\nAct of 1884 the representation of Ireland was, by an arrangement between\r\nparties, left unimpaired, and this leads me to a matter which serves, I\r\nthink, to show with what speed events move and how true was that remark\r\nof Disraeli's to Lord Lytton that \"in politics two years are an\r\neternity.\" It is little more than two years since the burning political\r\nquestion was the redistribution of seats on the lines proposed by Mr.\r\nGerald Balfour. The Unionist Press has for some years been endeavouring\r\nto rouse public opinion on this question of the alleged\r\nover-representation of Ireland in the House of Commons, and in view of\r\nthe share of attention which the matter received in the closing days of\r\nthe last Parliament it is as well to devote some attention to the topic.\r\n\r\nBy the Act of Union, which our opponents hold so sacred, Ireland was\r\ngiven 100 members in the House of Commons, and in the House of Lords 28\r\nrepresentative Peers, together with Bishops of the then Established\r\nChurch, and it was further enacted that this should be her\r\nrepresentation \"for ever.\" On the population basis, which to-day is\r\nurged by Unionists as the only fair mode of apportioning\r\nrepresentatives, Ireland was entitled at the date of the Union to many\r\nmore members than in fact she obtained. Her population at that time was\r\nnearly five and a half millions, that of Great Britain was less than ten\r\nand a half millions, and so, though she could claim more than a third of\r\nthe inhabitants of the three kingdoms, her representation was less than\r\none-sixth.\r\n\r\nBy the Reform Bill of 1832 the Irish members were increased to 105. Two\r\nseats have since been disfranchised, and we thus arrive at 103--the\r\nfigure at which the representation of the country stands to-day. The\r\ndisproportion from which Ireland suffered at the time of the Union had\r\nbecome still more acute by the time of the great Reform Bill, and no one\r\ncan seriously suggest that the addition of five seats redressed the\r\ninequality. According to the Census of 1831 the population of Great\r\nBritain was little over sixteen millions, and that of Ireland was seven\r\nand three-quarter millions. If these figures had formed the basis of a\r\nproportionate representation, Ireland would have had a little more than\r\n200 members--just about double the number which she actually returned.\r\n\r\nBy an agreement between parties, as I have said, in the last\r\nRedistribution of Seats Bill--that of 1885--the number of\r\nrepresentatives of Ireland was left unchanged, and it is only since the\r\nConservative Party has definitely thrown in its lot as an opponent of\r\nIrish demands as formulated to-day that this method of reducing the\r\nforce of their political opponents has begun to find favour amongst its\r\nmembers: Under the Bill of Mr. Gerald Balfour, by an ingenious\r\narrangement of raising the limits of population under which boroughs and\r\ncounties should no longer have separate representation, the scheme\r\nsecured the transfer of twenty-two seats from Ireland to Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe limit of population above which boroughs would have had to reach to\r\nmaintain their separate existence was fixed at 18,500, and under this\r\narrangement three boroughs in Ireland and six in Great Britain would\r\nhave lost their seats. If the limit had been fixed at 25,000 a total of\r\n19 seats in Great Britain and still only 3 in Ireland would have lost\r\ntheir member, while a minimum population of 35,000 would have\r\ndisfranchised 25 boroughs in Great Britain and only 4 in Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe actual proposal was elaborately calculated so as to produce the\r\nleast possible disturbance to the small boroughs in Great Britain, while\r\nsecuring the maximum of disfranchisement in Ireland.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the standard of population per member, which in the\r\ncase of counties was fixed at 65,000, secured the disfranchisement of\r\none Scottish county, the net disfranchisement of two English counties,\r\nand the deprivation of no less than 20 Irish counties of their member.\r\n\r\nThe grant of a new member to Belfast would have made the net loss to\r\nIreland 22 seats, and these were to be redistributed as between England,\r\nScotland and Wales in the proportion of 17:4:1.\r\n\r\nThese, then, are the data upon which we have to reckon. The Conservative\r\nGovernment, it should be added, greeted by a howl of disapproval even\r\nfrom its own supporters at the anomalies which it proposed to leave\r\nunredressed, appointed a Special Committee, the report of which was a\r\nposthumous child of the ministry which created it.\r\n\r\nIt is true that according to the terms of this report the borough limit\r\nof population was raised to 25,000, and the rotten boroughs which for\r\n\"historical reasons\" Mr. Balfour had been loth to disfranchise, were to\r\nbe swept away, but so far as we are concerned the results would have\r\nbeen much the same, for under its provisions Ireland would have suffered\r\na net loss of 23 seats.\r\n\r\nO'Connell pointed out to the Corporation of Dublin in 1843 far greater\r\ninconsistencies than can be indicated to-day. The population of Wales at\r\nthat day was 800,000, that of County of Cork was more than 700,000, but\r\nthe former was represented by 28 members and the latter by two; and\r\nfurther, he was able to point to five English counties with a total\r\npopulation of less than a million having 20 members to represent them,\r\nwhile five Irish counties with a population of over two millions\r\nreturned only ten members.\r\n\r\nIf it is the mere passion for a representation proportionate to\r\npopulation which is evinced, it is remarkable that it has only arisen\r\nsince the time at which it began to tell against Ireland, that when the\r\nboot was on the other leg there was no suggestion of redistribution on\r\nthe part of Conservatives. The truth is that for Unionists the idea of\r\nparing the claws of the Irish Party offers a tempting prospect. Our\r\nposition in the matter is quite plain: so long as Great Britain insists\r\non maintaining the Act of Union she must do so consistently in the sense\r\nthat it is a contract, albeit secured by chicanery, to the breach of any\r\nterm of which the consent of the party which it trammelled at least is\r\nnecessary. It will be answered that the Disestablishment of the Irish\r\nChurch made a breach in a clause of as binding a solemnity as that which\r\nguaranteed 100 members in the Imperial Parliament \"for ever.\" The\r\ndifference is that in that case the consent of the two parties was given\r\nby their representatives in the House of Commons, and the consent and\r\nthe sanction which it entails will never be secured--even possibly from\r\nUlster Orangemen--to a proposal for the curtailment of representation in\r\nthe Imperial Parliament under the present system of government.\r\n\r\nWe do not pretend for one moment that according to the rule of three we\r\nare not represented in the House of Commons by a number of members\r\ngreater than that to which our population at the present moment would,\r\ntaking the three kingdoms as whole, entitle us, but one must point out\r\nthat the system of electing representative peers robs us of even that\r\nmodicum of democratic peers of Parliament which Great Britain is able to\r\nsecure, and we repeat the argument of Mr. Gladstone that the distance of\r\nDublin from Westminster and the consequent deafness of the House of\r\nCommons to Irish opinion is to a slight extent redressed by the small\r\nexcess--calculated on lines of proportion--which Irish representation\r\nsecures at Westminster.\r\n\r\nAt any rate one has the satisfaction of knowing where one stands in the\r\nmatter, and one is aware that one part of the Conservative programme to\r\nbe applied whenever that party returns to power is that of which someone\r\nhas spoken as the detestable principle that to keep Ireland weak is the\r\nmost convenient way of governing her. And here let me in parenthesis\r\nremark on one fact in the conditions of Irish representation--namely,\r\nits solidarity. It is one of the commonplaces of politics that office is\r\nthe best adhesive which a party can enjoy, and the cold shades of\r\nopposition are apt too often to dissolve a unity which in office\r\nappeared secure. We have seen it of late years in the demoralisation of\r\nthe Liberals, who, after the retirement of Mr. Gladstone, fell to pieces\r\nas a party only on their resignation of office in 1895; we are seeing it\r\nnow in the disintegration of the Unionists ever since the debacle of the\r\ngeneral election.\r\n\r\nThere is a term which the Unionist Press is never tired of using in\r\nconnection with the Irish Party, the \"fissiparous tendency\" of which it\r\nis passionately fond of dinning into English ears, regardless of the\r\nmany cleavages which have occurred in English parties in the last fifty\r\nor even twenty years.\r\n\r\nThose divisions which there have been in the Nationalist ranks have been\r\nfor the most part concerned, not with measures, but with men, and even\r\nso it cannot be urged that they have been more than temporary in\r\nduration. The strength of wrist which has been displayed during the last\r\neight years by Mr. John Redmond in leading the United Irish Party has\r\nbeen a source of admiration to all. \"You need greater qualities,\" said\r\nCardinal de Retz, \"to be a party leader than to be Emperor of the\r\nUniverse.\" Much wisdom is demanded of an Irish leader in deciding the\r\ntactical questions arising from the vicissitudes of British parties.\r\nThat Irish Nationalists and British Liberals do not see eye to eye on\r\nseveral points of policy is well known. It may well be urged that no\r\nbetter proof of the unnatural form of the polity which holds the field\r\ncan be adduced than is to be found in the political allies of the two\r\nparties in Ireland; for the Catholics, democratic though they may be,\r\nare not associated with the party to which the traditions of a Church,\r\nthe most Conservative force in Europe, one might think would ally them,\r\nand the Orange Presbyterians, who are at heart Radicals, are divorced\r\nfrom their dissenting kinsmen in Great Britain and form the tail of the\r\nConservative Party. Hence it is that we have fallen between two stools,\r\nand University reform, to the principle of which Lord Salisbury, Lord\r\nRandolph Churchill, Sir Michael Hicks Beach, Mr. Balfour, and Mr.\r\nWyndham have been pledged, was shelved over and over again at the\r\nbidding of the Ulster Unionists, while the Conservative House of Lords\r\nthwarted the application of the principles of self-government to which a\r\nLiberal majority in the House of Commons gave its consent. Can anyone,\r\nin view of these facts, feel surprised that \"a plague on both your\r\nHouses\" expresses the feelings of the Irish people.\r\n\r\nThose nice people, to whom political barter is abhorrent, who at the\r\ntime of the general election deprecated the \"sale for a price\" of the\r\nNationalist vote, for so they were pleased to call what occurred, closed\r\ntheir eyes to the very obvious price of the Orange vote in the last\r\nParliament, which took the form of the retirement from office of Mr.\r\nWyndham, on failure to secure which, as the Orange leader\r\ndeclared--\"Ulster would have to call upon her reserves,\" meaning, one\r\nmust suppose, that the Irish Unionist office holders who were members of\r\nthe Ministry in numbers altogether disproportionate to their strength\r\nwould be called upon by the Orange Lodges to hand in their seals.\r\n\r\nEnglish Catholics are apt to say that if the Irish people in England had\r\nbeen directed by the Nationalist Party to vote for Conservative\r\ncandidates the safety of Catholic schools would thereby have been\r\nsafeguarded, but they forget that to put a Conservative Party in power\r\nwould be to give a blank cheque to a party pledged to cut down the\r\nIrish, and _pari passu_ the Catholic, representation in the House of\r\nCommons. That the fate of the Catholic voluntary schools in England is a\r\ndirect concern of the Irish members is admitted by all who are aware\r\nhow vast a majority of the Catholic poor in Great Britain are Irish, if\r\nnot by birth, at any rate by origin.\r\n\r\nThat the efforts in this connection of the Irish Party were appreciated\r\nby the head of the Catholic Church in England is seen by the very\r\ngracious letter which Archbishop Bourne addressed to Mr. Redmond at the\r\nend of the session of 1906, and it is significant that the letter of\r\nprotest against the Archbishop's action in regard to the moderate\r\ncounsels to secure a compromise on the part of the Irish, which was sent\r\nby certain English Catholic Peers to the Catholic bishops of Great\r\nBritain, was treated by the latter, with only two exceptions, with the\r\ncontumelious neglect which its disloyalty, the outcome of Tory\r\n_intransigeance_, deserved.\r\n\r\nEnglish Catholics, among whom knights harbingers and banneret bearers of\r\nthe Primrose League are numerous, who have leant all their weight in the\r\nscale to maintain the Protestant ascendancy in Ireland, have been ever\r\nready when occasion arose to appeal to the religious loyalty of the\r\nIrish members to support their interests. Their position has not been\r\nvery dignified, and its fruits will perhaps be seen if the reduction of\r\nthe Irish representation enters the sphere of practical politics. Party\r\nloyalty will claim their support, but at the same time they will realise\r\nthat if they give it they will be taking a step to reduce the only body\r\nin the House of Commons which can ever hope to represent Catholic\r\nprinciples and uphold Catholic interests.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether it struck many people in the course of the general\r\nelection that the country in which the elections made the least\r\ndifference was the one of the three kingdoms in which politics claim\r\nmost public attention. There was a monotony in the unopposed returns,\r\nand, in the result, in the place of 80 Nationalists, 1 Liberal, and 22\r\nUnionists, there appeared 83 Nationalists, 3 Liberals, and 18 Unionists,\r\nTo appreciate the full force of these numbers one must realise,\r\nmoreover, that of the Unionists in both cases, two out of the total\r\nrepresent University seats, the Conservative nature of which, whether in\r\nEngland, Ireland, or Scotland, is one of the features of political life\r\nwhich is, it appears, immutable. A study of the results shows that\r\nUnionism is in a minority in Ulster. There are in the present Parliament\r\n15 Unionists as against 15 Nationalists, who, with 3 Liberals, go to\r\nmake up the 33 members sitting at Westminster for that province.\r\n\r\nThese figures relieve me from the necessity of entering a caveat against\r\nthe use of the word Ulster as though the whole province were Unionist.\r\nVirtually, all that is Unionist in Ireland is in Ulster, but it is very\r\nfar from the truth to say that all Ulster is Unionist. Not one of the\r\nCounties of Donegal, Tyrone, Monaghan, or Cavan, out of the whole nine\r\nof which the province consists, returns a Unionist. In the three\r\nCounties of Down, Armagh, and Fermanagh, the representation is divided,\r\nand as for the two Counties of Londonderry and Antrim, which are\r\nordinarily the sole strongholds of the Orangemen, even in them a breach\r\nwas effected in West Belfast, where the Labour vote returned a\r\nNationalist for the first time since Mr. Sexton sat for it from\r\n1886-1892.\r\n\r\nThe obviousness and permanence of the Irish representation in Parliament\r\nis apt to cause its significance to be forgotten. \"It doesn't matter\r\nwhat we say, but for God's sake _let_ us be consistent,\" Lord Palmerston\r\nis reported to have said concerning some question of policy at a Cabinet\r\nCouncil. The Irish people, its worst enemies must admit, have been\r\nconsistent for the last thirty years in the demands which their\r\nrepresentatives have made ever since Isaac Butt crystallised the Irish\r\nantagonism to the _status quo_ in the \"Home Government Association,\"\r\nwhich he formed and on the programme of which he returned, after the\r\ngeneral election of 1874, with 59 followers in the House of Commons,\r\npledged to support the demand for Irish self-government. If we exclude\r\nthe fact that the extension of the franchise in 1884 increased the\r\nnumber of the popular representatives to more than 80, it is true to say\r\nthat since then there has been no change in the position of Irish\r\nrepresentation, just as there has been none in Irish demands. The\r\nLiberalism of Non-conformist Wales, and to a lesser degree of\r\nPresbyterian Scotland, are traditional, but their adherence to one side\r\nor the other in politics appears vacillating if one studies the election\r\nfigures, compared with the unwavering permanence of the Irish returns.\r\nWhen Lord Dudley declared that his aim as Viceroy would be to govern\r\nIreland according to Irish ideas a shout of protest arose from the\r\n_Times_ and the Irish Unionists, whose organ the _Times_ has constituted\r\nitself. Let us clear our minds of cant on the matter, and ask in view of\r\nthis open disclaimer of the democratic principles which are so much\r\nvaunted in England, for what reason is maintained the travesty of\r\nrepresentative government, the decrees of which it is frankly avowed are\r\nto be ignored? Every English Liberal must be impressed by the fact that\r\nthe party which has tried to arrogate to itself the sole claim to be\r\nthought Imperialist has scouted Home Rule resolutions passed again and\r\nagain by the legislatures of every one of the self-governing colonies.\r\nIt was at Montreal that Parnell was first hailed as the uncrowned king\r\nof Ireland, and what is more, that great apostle of Imperialism, Cecil\r\nRhodes, so far from seeing in Home Rule the first step towards the\r\ndismemberment of the Empire, signified his sympathy with the movement in\r\nthat direction by giving Mr. Parnell a cheque for £10,000 for the Irish\r\nParty funds on the one condition that he would support the retention of\r\nsome of the Irish members in the Imperial Parliament, as tending in the\r\ndirection of Imperial federation.\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago, when the present good feelings of England towards the\r\nUnited States were not in existence, it was easy, as it has been since\r\non the occasions on which relations have been strained over the\r\nVenezuelan and Alaskan questions, to denounce the aid granted to the\r\nNational movement by the Irish in America. To-day things are different;\r\nthese denunciations are not heard, and, moreover, as much aid and\r\nencouragement has been forthcoming in a proportional degree from the\r\ncolonies of the British Empire as from the Republic of North America. As\r\na matter of fact there are twice as many people of Irish blood in the\r\nUnited States as there are in Ireland, and thus, when in 1880 Congress\r\nthrew open its doors and invited Parnell to address it on the Irish\r\nquestion, it was acting in accordance with the sentiments of a vast\r\nnumber of the citizens of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Lord North roused the American Colonies by attempts to\r\nrule them against their own wishes, and the result was that they secured\r\ntheir independence. Austria refused self-government to Italy, and in\r\nconsequence lost its Italian territory, while Hungary, to which it\r\ngranted the boon, was retained in the dual monarchy. Spain, by refusing\r\nautonomy to her colonies, suffered the loss of South. America, Cuba,\r\nPuerto Rica, and the Philippines, and the action of Holland in the same\r\nway led to the separation from it of the kingdom of the Belgians.\r\n\r\nAll these are cases in point, but the most interesting parallel is that\r\nof Lower Canada, which, like Ireland, is Celtic and Catholic, and is,\r\nmoreover, a French-speaking province. There, too, there was a struggle\r\nbetween races, and it was only by \"merging\"--as Lord Durham expressed\r\nit--\"the odious animosities of origin in the feelings of a nobler and\r\nmore comprehensive nationality\" that peace was restored. The Tory\r\nCabinet of Peel gave Canada Parliamentary Government, and proclaimed\r\nrebels became Ministers of the Crown, and who is there who will contend\r\nthat the application of the maxim \"trust in the people\" of that great\r\nImperial statesman, Lord Durham, was not justified by the results of the\r\ngrant of self-government not to a peaceful and loyal colony, but to one\r\nwhich was boiling with discontent and rebellion. Twelve years after Lord\r\nDurham's experiment, the Government of Lord Derby gave Australia similar\r\ninstitutions, and that fact alone shows how successful the policy had\r\nproved. Great Britain has just given representative government to the\r\nTransvaal and the Orange River Colony. Within five years of the peace of\r\nVereeniging the pledges of that compact were honourably fulfilled in\r\nspite of the forebodings of one of the political parties, and Louis\r\nBotha, the Premier of one of the new colonies, is the most distinguished\r\nof the generals who less than six years ago were leading their armies\r\nagainst those of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nEngland has realised that it is only by government with the consent of\r\nthe governed that she can maintain her colonies, and the contrast\r\nbetween her treatment of Ireland and that of her colonies is to be seen\r\nin the fact that to them is extended the protection of the British\r\nfleet, while they are at the same time left free to legislate in the\r\nmatter of trade, to deal with their own defence, and all the while\r\ncontribute nothing to Imperial charges.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the policy of North and the success of that of Durham are\r\napparent. The former has been applied in Ireland, although the country\r\nhas consistently cried out for the latter. How long do those with whom\r\nthe last word in government is the policy applied to-day, imagine that\r\nthey can govern a country at the bayonet's edge in such a way that she\r\nhas neither the weight of an equal nor the freedom of a dependency? Lord\r\nRosebery, whose liberalism may be described in the same terms as those\r\nin which Disraeli denounced the Conservatism of Peel--\"the mule of\r\npolitics which engenders nothing\"--has more than once in the last few\r\nyears declared his hostility to the principle of Irish self-government,\r\nand the explanation of his position which he offers is that the absence\r\nof loyalty on the part of Ireland is the obstacle which stands in the\r\nway of his advocacy of such a policy. One may well ask in reply whether\r\nLord Rosebery is aware of the complete absence of loyalty at the time\r\nwhen Canada was granted self-government, and the state of feeling\r\ntowards England in the new South African colonies two years ago is a\r\nfurther case in point; but the most pertinent question which can be\r\nasked of Lord Rosebery is on what ground he makes this his condition\r\nprecedent, in view of the fact that the loyalty or disloyalty of\r\nIrishmen stands exactly as it did in 1886 and 1893, in both of which\r\nyears Lord Rosebery was a member of the Ministries which introduced Home\r\nRule Bills into Parliament.\r\n\r\nThat hostility is evinced by large sections of Irishmen to England, as\r\nwell as by Englishmen to Ireland, and that much sympathy was felt, as it\r\nwas by the most distinguished of the members of the present Cabinet, for\r\nthe South African Republics, which Irishmen regarded as struggling\r\nnationalities like their own, I am not concerned to deny. The same\r\nfeeling of hostility, as I have already said, was rampant at the time of\r\nthe Crimean war, and may be expected to continue till the end of the\r\npresent system of government arrives; but to those who, for party\r\npurposes, declare that they see a risk that possible European\r\ncomplications would be accentuated for Great Britain to the point of\r\ndanger by the proximity of an Ireland with a Parliament in Dublin, the\r\nanswer is, that it is difficult to conceive a state of affairs more\r\nfraught with danger to England than would be found in the existence\r\nduring a great war of an adjacent island which has been haughtily denied\r\nthat mode of government which she claims, and which in the troubles of\r\nthe other country will see an opportunity of extracting by threats and\r\nfrom fear in an hour of peril that which she was unable to secure by\r\nother means in the day of prosperity. One may well ask whether this\r\nprospect is one to which Great Britain can look forward with calmness,\r\nthat she should have to legislate at fever heat to cope with the\r\ncontingencies of the moment with no well-ordered scheme of things; not\r\nthat way lies an end by which she will secure peace conceived in the\r\nspirit of peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nIRELAND AND GREAT BRITAIN\r\n\r\n     \"In reason all government without the consent of the governed\r\n     is the very definition of slavery; but in fact eleven men well\r\n     armed will certainly subdue one single man in his shirt....\r\n     Those who have used to cramp liberty have gone so far as to\r\n     resent even the liberty of complaining, although a man upon\r\n     the rack was never known to be refused the liberty of roaring\r\n     as loud as he thought fit.\"--JONATHAN SWIFT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe loss of her language by Ireland was, politically, the worst calamity\r\nwhich could have befallen her, for it lent colour to the otherwise\r\nunsupported assertion that she was a mere geographical expression in no\r\nway differing from the adjoining island. The manner in which the revival\r\nof the Irish tongue has been taken up by the whole country with,\r\nliterally, the support of peasant and peer is one of the most remarkable\r\nphenomena of modern Irish life. That it has any direct political\r\nsignificance is untrue, for the aim of its pioneers in the Gaelic League\r\nhas been fulfilled, and it remains strictly non-sectarian and\r\nnon-political. From the purely utilitarian point of view, no doubt a\r\npolytechnic could provide a dozen subjects in which a more profitable\r\nreturn could be made for the money and time invested than does the study\r\nof Gaelic, but book-keeping or shorthand would not have roused the\r\nenthusiasm which this revival of a half dead language has evoked and\r\nwhich is incidentally an educative movement in that the learning of a\r\nnew language is of a direct value as a mental training, while as a\r\nsocial organisation it has done more in inculcating a public spirit and\r\na proper pride than could otherwise possibly have been achieved. The\r\nrevival of the Czech language when almost dead, at the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth century, and the eminent success of bi-lingualism in\r\nFlanders, are hopeful signs for the preservation of a National\r\ncharacteristic, the disappearance of which would have been welcomed only\r\nby those who hold that Ireland as a nationality has no existence apart\r\nfrom Great Britain, and the preservation of which will produce the\r\nmental alertness characteristic of a bi-lingual people.\r\n\r\nThe temperance work done by the Gaelic League in providing occupation of\r\na pleasant nature and social intercourse of a harmless kind is one of\r\nits chief titles to distinction, for in this aspect it has encouraged\r\nthe preservation of Irish songs, music, dances, and games. One other\r\nthing it, and it alone, can do. One-half of the emigrants from Ireland\r\ngo on tickets or money sent from friends in the United States, and in my\r\nopinion one of the most powerful influences in staying the present\r\nlamentable tide in that direction will be to foster in the branches in\r\nAmerica the notion that the time has come when every Irishman and woman\r\nwho can by any possible means do so should be persuaded to remain in\r\nIreland, and not to emigrate.\r\n\r\nThe ridiculous situation which was allowed by successive Governments to\r\npersist in the Gaelic-speaking districts of the West until a few years\r\nago, in which teachers were appointed to the schools without any\r\nknowledge of the only language spoken by the children whom they\r\npurported to educate, is well illustrated by the statement on the part\r\nof one of their number to the effect that it took two years to\r\nextirpate, to \"wring\" the Irish speech out of the children and replace\r\nit, one must suppose, by English, and this process, it must be\r\nremembered, was gone through with the children of a peasantry whom a\r\ndistinguished French publicist--M.L. Paul-Dubois--has described as\r\nperhaps the most intellectual in Europe.\r\n\r\nIt is characteristic of English government that, whereas from 1878\r\nonwards Irish figured in the programme of the National Board, and\r\nGovernment grants were made for proficiency therein as in other\r\nsubjects, one of the last acts of the late Government was to withdraw\r\nthese grants for the teaching of Irish. So long as there was no large\r\nnumber of people anxious to learn Gaelic in Ireland, Government gave\r\nhelp towards its study, but the very moment in which, with the rise of\r\nthe Gaelic League, the number learning the language began to increase,\r\nGovernment put its foot down and proceeded to discourage it by a\r\nwithdrawal of grants. The order effecting this was withdrawn by Mr.\r\nBryce. The signal failure of the attempts made to kill the Gaelic\r\nmovement with ridicule, on the part of those who saw in it an\r\nevil-disposed attempt to stop the Anglicising of the country, was as\r\nconspicuous as has been the ill success of the petty tyranny of the\r\nInland Revenue authorities, who took out summonses against those who had\r\ntheir names engraved on their dogs' collars in Gaelic. Trinity College\r\nhas had for half a century two scholarships and a prize in Gaelic\r\nattached to its Divinity School, and the fact that the ultimate trust of\r\nthe fund of its Gaelic Professorship on cesser of appointment is to a\r\nProtestant proselytising society shows the interest which has actuated\r\nthe study of Gaelic in that foundation, and its attitude towards the\r\nGaelic League found expression in Dr. Mahaffy, one of its most\r\ndistinguished scholars, who, having failed to kill the movement with\r\nridicule, changed his line and declared that the revival of Gaelic would\r\nbe unreasonable and dishonest if it were not impossible.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this, the success of the League, which was only established\r\nin 1893, is astonishing. In 1900 it consisted of 120 branches; to-day\r\nthere are more than 1,000. The circulation of Gaelic books published\r\nunder its auspices is over 200,000 a year. In the year 1899 it was\r\ntaught in 100 Primary Schools, it is now taught in 3,000.\r\n\r\nThe number of people, including adults, learning Irish in evening\r\ncontinuation classes was in 1899 little over 1,000, and is to-day over\r\n100,000.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance that in London on the Sunday nearest St. Patrick's Day\r\na service with Gaelic hymns and a Gaelic sermon is conducted every year,\r\nand has been conducted for the last three years, at the Cathedral at\r\nWestminster, and is attended by 6,000 or 7,000 Irish people, and that\r\nlast year Dr. Alexander held a Gaelic service in a Protestant Cathedral\r\nin Dublin, should do much to show the manner in which the movement is\r\nspreading among all classes, and to indicate that it will in time\r\ndemolish that false situation by which, for the greater part of the\r\nContinent, Ireland has been looked upon as merely an island on the other\r\nside of England to be seen through English glasses.\r\n\r\nThat strange recuperative power which the country has evinced at\r\nintervals in her history is, without a doubt, once again asserting\r\nitself, and a new spirit of restlessness and of effort, which in no\r\nsense can be supposed to supplant, or to do more than to supplement,\r\npolitical aspirations, is making itself felt.\r\n\r\nIt is doing so in a number of different directions, but the ultimate aim\r\nof all the forces which are at work may be said to be, in a cant phrase,\r\nto make it as much an object to desire to live in the country as\r\nhitherto it has been to die for it.\r\n\r\nThe inculcation of a spirit of self-reliance, the discouragement among\r\nthe poorer classes of the notion that emigration is an object at which\r\none should aim, the destruction among the richer of that spirit which is\r\nknown at \"West British,\" and which implies an apologetic air on the part\r\nof its owner for being Irish at all, these are among the effects of the\r\nnew movement.\r\n\r\nThe desire to see Ireland Irish, and not a burlesque of what is English,\r\nis its _raison d'être_, and that it has made progress along the lines\r\nmapped out, the Gaelic League, from which it gains its driving force,\r\nthe literary revival, and the movement for industrial development bear\r\nample witness.\r\n\r\nFrom the impression made by a few wits, English people have jumped to\r\nthe conclusion that as a people we are specially blessed with a sense of\r\nhumour, a curious _non sequitur_ which the restraint, consciously or\r\nunconsciously inculcated by the Gaelic League, is likely to make more\r\napparent, for it is killing that conception of the Irishman as typically\r\na boisterous buffoon with intervals of maudlin sentimentality which the\r\nstage and the popular song have so long been content to depict without\r\nprotest from us, and which left Englishmen with feelings not more\r\nexalted than those of their sixteenth and seventeenth century ancestors,\r\nto whom \"mere Irish\" was a term of opprobrium.\r\n\r\nIn their appeals to sentiment, Englishmen have not been more successful.\r\nThe appointment of Mr. Wyndham to the Irish Office was hailed by them as\r\na certain success on the ground of his descent from Lord Edward\r\nFitzgerald, a traitor, on their own showing, descent from whom one would\r\nhave thought should have been rather concealed than advertised. They\r\nwaxed sentimental over the bravery of the Irish soldiers in the South\r\nAfrican war, among which the achievements of the Inniskillings at\r\nPieter's Hill and the Connaught Rangers at Colenso were only surpassed\r\nby the Dublin Fusiliers at Talana Hill, out of a thousand of whom only\r\nthree hundred survived. But the strange thing was that while English\r\npeople in honour of these men wore shamrock on St. Patrick's Day, just\r\nas in the case of the Crimea, the sympathy of their own country was not\r\non the side upon which they fought, and the people of their country\r\nlooked upon the Irish soldiers as _condottieri_ fighting in an alien\r\ncause. One cannot draw up an indictment against a whole nation, and if\r\nthis be treason in the opinion of Englishmen, one can only reply that to\r\ncommit the unpardonable sin against the body politic there must be\r\nsomething more on the part of a people than a continuance of feelings\r\ntowards a state of affairs against which they have always protested, and\r\nin which they have never acquiesced.\r\n\r\nHistorically we have been the home of lost causes, and the fact that so\r\nmany of the national heroes of Ireland have ended their lives in failure\r\nhas had no small effect in bringing it to pass that there, at any rate,\r\nit is not true to say that nothing succeeds like success. Hugh O'Neill,\r\nRed Hugh O'Donnell, Owen Roe O'Neill, Sarsfield, Wolfe Tone, Grattan,\r\nthe Young Irelanders, O'Connell, Butt, Parnell, not one of these ended\r\nhis career amid the glamour of achieved success, and the result of this,\r\nI think, is an irresponsibility which looks not so much to the\r\nprobability of the fruition of movements as to their inception; and,\r\nafter all, a flash in the pan is apt to do more harm than good.\r\n\r\nTo this fact I attribute the circumstance that there has always been a\r\nsmall section of the population to which the ordinary methods of\r\nconstitutional agitation have appeared feeble and unavailing, but to\r\nunderstand to the full the reason for it one must realise that if there\r\nhave been three insurrections in the history of the United Parliament,\r\nthere has twelve times in the same course of time been famine, that\r\nparent of despairing violence, throughout the country.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary Englishman seeing in the state a polity maintained by a\r\nlong tradition, which has undergone change gradually and in measured\r\nprogress, in which agitation, when it has been rife as it was before the\r\nfirst Reform Bill, has died down on redress of grievances, almost as\r\nsoon as it has arisen has no conception of the relative, and indeed\r\nabsolute, unstable state of equilibrium in the affairs of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe fact that one has to go back to the battle of Sedgemoor for the last\r\noccasion when in anything dignified by a higher name than riot, blood\r\nhas been shed in England; the fact that when a retiring English\r\nAttorney-General appointed his son to a third-rate position in the legal\r\nprofession an outcry arose in which the salient feature was surprise\r\nthat so flagrant a job should have been perpetrated, are indications of\r\nwhat I mean when I say that English people are in every circumstance of\r\ntheir outlook precluded from eliminating in their view of Irish affairs\r\nthat deep-seated conviction, which in the case of their own country is\r\nfounded on indisputable fact, that radical change in the well-ordered\r\nevolution of the State is out of keeping with the sequence which has\r\nhitherto held sway, and in so far as it is so is a thing to be guarded\r\nagainst and avoided.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland no one can claim to see a similar gradual metamorphosis in\r\nthe light-of the history of the last one hundred, or even fifty, years,\r\nRadicalism, experimentalism, empiricism have been let loose on every\r\ninstitution of the country, and it is only when we take the greatest\r\ncommon measure of the results that we can see that the upshot has been\r\non the whole rather good than bad. When Parnell declared that while\r\naccepting Mr. Gladstone's Home Rule proposals he must nevertheless state\r\ndefinitely that no one could set a limit to the march of a nation, he\r\nwas stating an axiom which is every day illustrated by English statesmen\r\nof either party when they say, on the one hand, that the refusal, and on\r\nthe other hand the concession, of certain fiscal proposals will lead to\r\nthe dismemberment of the Empire. What can be stated in cold blood as a\r\npossible contingency in the case of, say, Canada or New Zealand has only\r\nto be adumbrated in that of Ireland to be denounced, not as a\r\njustifiable retort to the flouting of local demands, but as a\r\ntreasonable aspiration to be put down with a strong hand.\r\n\r\nThe new aspect of Imperial responsibility as entailing on the mother\r\ncountry a position not of contempt of, but rather of deference to, the\r\nwishes of the colonies cannot but have a direct bearing on Anglo-Irish\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\nIt is the greatest feature in Parnell's achievement that he succeeded in\r\npersuading ardent spirits to lay aside other weapons, while he strove\r\nwhat he could do by stretching the British Constitution to the utmost,\r\nlinking up as he did all the forces of discontent to a methodical use of\r\nthe Parliamentary machine. In the very depth of the winter of our\r\ndiscontent, in 1881, when he was in Kilmainham Gaol, crime became most\r\nrampant; in truth--as he had grimly said would be the case--Captain\r\nMoonlight had taken his place, and in the following year when he was let\r\nout of gaol it was expressly to slow down the agitation. More than one\r\nPrime Minister has had to echo those words of the Duke of Wellington of\r\nseventy years ago--\"If we don't preserve peace in Ireland we shall not\r\nbe a Government,\" and the periodic recrudescence of lawlessness which\r\nthe island has seen has, it is freely admitted, forced the hands of\r\nGovernments which were inflexible in the face of mere constitutional\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\nThe latest aspect which this anti-constitutional movement has taken in\r\nIreland is what is known as Sinn Féin, which adopts a rigid attitude of\r\nprotest against the existing condition of things, and which declares\r\nthat the recognition of the _status quo_ involved in any acquiescence in\r\nthe present mode of government is a betrayal of the whole position. The\r\nexistence of this spirit, which is entirely negligible outside two or\r\nthree large towns, is not surprising; although it advocates a passive\r\nresistance it is the direct descendant of the party which advocated\r\nphysical force in the past, and in so far as it proposes to use morally\r\ndefensible weapons it is likely to have the more driving power. The\r\nconsistent opposition which the Catholic Church offered to revolutionary\r\nviolence and her sympathy with constitutionally-expressed Parliamentary\r\nagitation have resulted in an anti-clerical colour which this new\r\nmovement has acquired, and to this, force is added by the measure of\r\nstrength which it has gained among a certain number of young Protestants\r\nin Belfast, whose fathers must turn in their graves at this reversal of\r\nopinion on a question which was to them a _chose jugée_, a veritable\r\narticle of faith. The proposals of Sinn Féin include a boycott of all\r\nEnglish institutions in Ireland, educational and of other kinds, the\r\nabandonment of the attendance of Irish members in the Imperial\r\nParliament at Westminster, elections to which Sinn Féin candidates are,\r\nif necessary, to contest on the undertaking that if elected they will\r\nnot take the oath at Westminster, but will attend a self-constituted\r\nNational Council in Dublin, under the control of which a system of\r\nNational education and of National arbitration courts, in addition to a\r\nNational Stock Exchange, will be established. To develop Irish\r\nindustries this body, it is suggested, will appoint in foreign ports\r\nIrish Consuls, completely independent of the British Consular service,\r\nwho will attend to the interests and the development of Irish trade.\r\nLastly, the most practical of their proposals lies in the discouragement\r\nof recruiting, a movement which, if applied on a large scale, would have\r\na remarkable effect on the resources of the three kingdoms under a\r\nvoluntary system of military service.\r\n\r\nThese proposals, which, until a Gaelic name was thought necessary for\r\ntheir acceptance in Ireland, were known as the Hungarian policy, are\r\nadmittedly based on the success of the struggle for Hungarian autonomy\r\nwhich culminated in 1867, but the fact which the advocates of the\r\napplication of this policy to Ireland omit to mention, is that Hungary\r\nwas face to face with a divided and distracted Austria, defeated by the\r\nPrussians at Sadowa, while in the case of Ireland we are concerned with\r\na united Great Britain, which has shown no great signs of diminution in\r\nher power. A closer parallel than that of Hungary is to be found in the\r\ncase of Bohemia, which, in respect of general social conditions and the\r\nproportion of national to hostile forces, bore a much stronger\r\nresemblance to Ireland, and which adopted in 1867 a policy of withdrawal\r\nof its representatives from a hostile legislature with results so\r\ndisastrous that after a few years she returned to the methods which the\r\nSinn Féin party are anxious to make an end of in Ireland.\r\n\r\nAll foreign parallels, however, are apt to be misleading, but Irishmen\r\nhave only to remember the fact that the secession of Grattan and his\r\nfollowers from the Irish Parliament in 1797 paved the way for the\r\npassing of the Act of Union to find in it a warning against what is the\r\nmain plank in the platform of Sinn Féin--\"the policy of\r\nwithdrawal\"--which, moreover, would leave the control of Irish\r\nlegislation to the tender mercies of such Irish members as Mr. Walter\r\nLong and Mr. William Moore, which would further involve the condemnation\r\nof the policy pursued by every Irish leader since the Union, and would\r\nmean the abandonment of the weapon by which every Irish reform has been\r\nwrested from English prejudice--namely, an independent party in the\r\nHouse of Commons, backed up by a vigorous organisation in Ireland.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, those who have read the high-flown manifestoes of the Sinn\r\nFéin party will be concerned to look around for the result of the\r\nproposal which they have been preaching for the last three years, and if\r\nthey find nothing but a ridiculous mouse in the matter of achievement\r\nwill be inclined to declare that not a mountain but a molehill has been\r\nin labour. It is a singular fact that although since the general\r\nelection there have been no less than ten by-elections in Ireland, of\r\nwhich only two were in \"safe\" Unionist seats, in no single instance have\r\nthe advocates of the policy of abstention from attendance from\r\nWestminster had the courage to go to the polls with a candidate of\r\ntheir own. We are told by the exponents of the new policy that they are\r\nsweeping the country before them, but the only certain data which\r\nIrishmen have as to its popularity is that in ten per cent. of the\r\nconstituencies in the country, the only ones to which any test has been\r\napplied, in no instance has Sinn Féin dared to show its face at the\r\nhustings.\r\n\r\nTwo Irish members, it is true, resigned uncompromisingly from the Irish\r\nParty and joined the new organisation in disgust at the scope of the\r\nIrish Council Bill. Sir Thomas Esmonde, who expressed his intention of\r\nresigning, was, with what it must have come to regret as indecent haste,\r\nelected a member of the Sinn Féin organisation, but within a few weeks\r\ndeclared his willingness \"to act with the Parliamentary Party, or any\r\nother set of men who put the National question in the forefront,\" and\r\nwent on to express his opinion that the chances of a Sinn Féin candidate\r\nin his constituency of North Wexford would be nil.\r\n\r\nSo far at any rate Sinn Féiners must admit that \"_beacoup de bruit, pen\r\nde fruit_\" sums up their action in regard to Irish affairs. Any success\r\nin propagandism which they may have achieved is to be traced to a\r\nnatural impatience, especially among _dilletante_ politicians, whose\r\nexperience is purely academic, at the slowness of the Parliamentary\r\nmachine in effecting reforms, but any force which it possesses is\r\ndiscounted by the fact that men whose views are extreme in youth tend to\r\nbecome the most moderate with advancing years--a fact of which a classic\r\nexample is to be found in the career of Sir Charles Gavan Duffy, one of\r\nthe most distinguished of the Young Irelanders, who, after a brilliant\r\ncareer in Australia, returned to European his old age and spent several\r\nyears in the attempt to persuade Conservatives to adopt the policy of\r\nHome Rule--a propaganda on his part to which the episode of Lord\r\nCarnarvon bears witness, and which was advocated by him in the\r\n_National_ and _Contemporary Reviews_ in 1884 and 1885. It may well be\r\nthat the political groundlings who are at present the backbone of the\r\nSinn Féin movement will, when they gain political experience, alter\r\ntheir views in as complete a manner. One can draw an English parallel to\r\nthis movement in Ireland. There are in the former, as in the latter,\r\ncountry a certain limited number of people who hold extreme political\r\nviews, which in the case of the English are pure socialism. The English\r\nextremists have been so far successful as to secure the return of one\r\nMember of Parliament in full sympathy with their aspirations. The Irish\r\nextremists have not so far dared to put to the test their chance of\r\nobtaining even one Parliamentary ewe lamb. Without the advantage which\r\nthe English _intransigeants_ possess, of a few weeks' knowledge on the\r\npart of one person of the inside working of Parliamentary government, in\r\nexactly the same manner as do the Englishmen of the same type, these\r\nIrishmen spend their time reviling popular representatives as ignorant,\r\nvenal, and beneath contempt. A prophet who, on the basis of the election\r\nof Mr. Grayson, foretold an imminent dissolution of the democratic\r\nforces in Great Britain, would in truth have more ground on which to\r\nbase his forecast than has one who from the nebulous movements of the\r\nSinn Féin party, arrives at an analogous conclusion in the case of\r\nIreland. That the political landmarks in Ireland have in the last few\r\nyears shifted is obvious to the most superficial observer. The\r\ndevolutionist secession from orthodox Unionism, the Independent Orange\r\nLodge represented by Mr. Sloan, the \"Russellite\" Ulster tenant-farmers,\r\nand the rise of a democratic vote in Belfast regardless of the strife of\r\nsects, all serve as indications of this fact; but let it be noted that\r\nwhile we have evidences in these directions of the forces at work in the\r\ndisintegration of the old Orange strongholds, we have no such obvious\r\nindications of the upheaval going on in the traditional Nationalist\r\nParty, save only the mere _ipse dixit_ of the very people who assure us\r\nthat they themselves are making it felt. There is every reason to\r\nsuppose that the Sinn Féin movement, in so far as it consists of passive\r\nresistance, will be regarded by the Irish people as merely doing\r\nnothing. They could understand a non-Parliamentary action were it\r\nreplaced by physical force, and the weakness of passive resistance lies\r\nprecisely in this, that the logical result of its failure is an appeal\r\nto armed revolt which no man in his senses can in modern conditions in\r\nIreland think possible, or, if possible, calculated to be other than\r\ndisastrous. The attempt which the Sinn Féin organisation has\r\nconsistently, if unsuccessfully, made to arrogate to itself all credit\r\nfor the progress of the Gaelic League and of the Industrial Revival, is\r\nsingularly disingenuous in view of the assistance which both those\r\nmovements have received and are receiving from the Parliamentary Party\r\nand its allies. The provisions of the Merchandise Marks Act, and the\r\nfact that through the agency of members of the Irish Party the Foreign\r\nOffice has directed British Consuls abroad to publish separately the\r\nreturns of Irish imports, which have hitherto been lost by their\r\ninclusion in the returns under the one head \"British,\" will do far more\r\nfor the development of the Irish export trade than the well-meaning but\r\nacademic resolutions of their critics; and in the matter of social\r\nreform I have yet to learn that any body of men have done such good work\r\nfor their country as have the Irish members by the passing into law, on\r\ntheir initiative, of the Labourers Act, by which nearly half a million\r\nof the Irish population will be rescued from conditions of life which,\r\nwith a population lacking the religious sense of the Irish poor, would\r\nhave resulted in absolute moral degradation.\r\n\r\nI have spoken throughout of the exponents of Sinn Féin as of a party,\r\nbut it is difficult to find the common measure of agreement which such\r\na term connotes in the heterogeneous elements which for the moment call\r\nthemselves by the same name. We read of old Fenians, who have ever\r\nhankered after physical force, presiding over meetings to expound\r\npassive resistance in which young Republicans from Belfast rub shoulders\r\nwith men whose ideal is vaguely expressed as repeal--a return one must\r\nsuppose to that anomalous constitution of Grattan's Parliament in which,\r\nwhile the legislature was independent the Executive was not responsible\r\nthereto, but went out of office with the Ministry in the Parliament at\r\nWestminster.\r\n\r\nIrish Parliamentary candidates are selected under a system in which the\r\nparty caucus has far less share than in any part of the three kingdoms.\r\nThey have behind them the credentials of popular election which are not\r\npossessed by a single one of the self-constituted group of critics who\r\nassail them; and one need only say that vague, unfounded charges as to\r\npolitical probity, in no instance substantiated by a single shred of\r\nproof, do not redound to the credit of those who frame them.\r\n\r\nWhen the advocates of Sinn Féin can point to a record of services as\r\ndisinterested and as consistent as those of the Irish Parliamentary\r\nParty, when they can produce evidence of work in the immediate past as\r\nfruitful for the good of their country as the Labourers Act, the Town\r\nTenants Act, and the Merchandise Marks Act, they will have some ground\r\nupon which to claim a hearing from their countrymen. Till then they have\r\nno cause to throw stones at those who are honestly working for the good\r\nof their country, although they do not proclaim themselves on the\r\nhousetops the only patriotic section of the Irish people.\r\n\r\nNot one of the advocates of this bloodless war which they propose has,\r\nso far as I am aware, in spite of three years spent in preaching on the\r\nsubject, refused to pay income tax, the only tax resistance to which is\r\npossible in Ireland. Those who hold Civil Service appointments under the\r\nBritish Crown have not in a single instance, unless I am mistaken,\r\nhanded in their resignations. These are the criticisms which they\r\ninevitably draw down on their heads by stooping to make imputations as\r\nto men whose services to the country should put them above reach of\r\nanything of the kind. Within the last few months two of the leaders of\r\nSinn Féin appeared, in the course of a few weeks--the one as plaintiff,\r\nthe other as defendant--represented by a Tory counsel, in the Four\r\nCourts in Dublin, before a member of a foreign judiciary, which on their\r\nfundamental axiom should be taboo. The reason is to be found, perhaps,\r\nin the fact that they have not yet devised a means by which attachment\r\nand committal for contempt of their proposed amateur tribunals will be\r\nmade effectual. The method by which the resolutions of the National\r\nCouncil are to be carried into effect has not yet been explained, nor\r\nhave the means by which they will acquire a sanction in so far as their\r\nbreach will involve the offender in a punishment. We have yet to learn\r\nwhat guarantee there is that the consuls in foreign parts, whom they\r\npropose to establish and maintain by voluntary subscription, will be\r\ngiven any facilities by the countries in which they are stationed,\r\nwithout which their presence in those foreign countries would be of no\r\nservice whatever.\r\n\r\nHalf a century ago a great voluntary effort, which may well be called\r\nSinn Féin, was made in the foundation of the Catholic University in\r\nDublin. In spite of the glamour of John Henry Newman's name it was\r\ncrippled from the fact of the poverty of the country on the voluntary\r\ncontributions of which it had to depend. One may well ask if the\r\nexponents of the new policy have any confidence that the same obstacle\r\nwill not stand in the way of more than a trivial fraction of their\r\nextensive, and as I think Utopian, proposals. The No Rent Manifesto\r\nfell flat in the midst of the very bitterest struggle of the land war.\r\nDoes anyone think it likely that we shall see behind the doctrinaires of\r\nthe Sinn Féin group a country united in cold blood to repudiate its\r\nobligations under the Land Purchase and Labourers' Acts?\r\n\r\nThe Irish people are under no illusions as to the advocates of Sinn\r\nFéin, and will, I am convinced, refuse to judge it on its own valuation.\r\nIf for no other reason its exponents would be suspect in that they have\r\nnot scrupled to assure a sympathetic Orange audience of the fact that\r\nthey are on the point of rending asunder the allegiance of Ireland to\r\nthe National cause. While protesting aloud their patriotism they have\r\nnot thought it incompatible with their declarations to flood the columns\r\nof the Unionist Press--the most hostile to the democracy of their\r\ncountry--with expositions of their views, coupled with strident\r\ndenunciations of their Nationalist opponents.\r\n\r\nTheir tirades have been received with open arms by the Orangemen as\r\naffording a weapon in the division of their common enemy, by which may\r\nbe maintained that _de facto_, if not _de jure_, ascendancy, which in\r\nspite of the ballot, the extended franchise, and local government,\r\npersists in Ireland. But, on the other hand, as has been well said, the\r\nfact is not lost on the great bulk of the Irish people that it is from\r\nthe Sinn Féin section--the little coterie which professes to stand for\r\nevery sort of idealism--that all the imputations and innuendoes have\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nThis extreme school, of course, will in no sense be pleased by\r\nameliorative legislation as applied by this or any other Government,\r\nbecause the worse England treats Ireland the stronger will be their\r\nposition, and every concession gained by the country is so much ground\r\ncut from under their feet; but the policy of refusing all attempts at\r\npiecemeal improvement, on the ground that a complete reversal of the\r\nexisting system is called for, may be magnificent, and on this there\r\nmust be two opinions, but it is not practical politics which will\r\ncommend itself to the ordinary Irishman. \"Men,\" wrote Edmund Burke more\r\nthan a hundred years ago, \"do not live upon blotted paper; the\r\nfavourable or the unfavourable mind of the rulers is of more consequence\r\nto a nation than the black letter of any statute.\" Irish people are not\r\nlikely to fail to realise this, and the experience of the past is such\r\nas to show that remedial legislation has been powerless to stay the\r\nNational demand, and concessions, so far from putting a period to the\r\nappeals of the people for the control of their own affairs, have rather\r\nincreased the vehemence of their demand, for with democracy, as with\r\nmost things, _l'appétit vient en mangeant_.\r\n\r\nAs against the body which we have been considering one hears people\r\nspeaking of the liberal school of Unionists--the rise of which is so\r\nmarked a product of recent years in Ireland--as a body who represent the\r\nmoderate section of opinion, the demands of which are reasonable and\r\ncomprise all that the Liberal Party can be expected to concede; and\r\namong this section of recent writers on Irish politics three stand out\r\nprominently by reason of their position and of their proposals:--Mr.\r\nT.W. Russell, in \"Ireland and the Empire,\" preached with cogent force\r\nthe need for the last step in the expropriation of the Irish landlords,\r\nthe one great obstacle, in his eyes, to a prosperous and contented\r\nIreland. In the economic field Sir Horace Plunkett has pleaded, in\r\n\"Ireland in the New Century,\" for the salvation of the Irish race by the\r\ndevelopment of industries; while in the political sphere Lord Dunraven,\r\nin \"The Outlook in Ireland,\" has urged the pressing need for the closer\r\nassociation of Irishmen with the government of their own country. I am\r\nnot concerned to deny the remarkable fact which these volumes indicate\r\nin the change of view on the part of three representative Protestant and\r\nUnionist Irishmen; but in this connection two things, on which\r\nsufficient stress has not so far been laid, must be recalled. In the\r\nfirst place the members of what is called the middle party are recruits\r\nnot from Nationalism but from Unionism; it is some of the members of the\r\nlatter party who have abated their vehemence, and not any of those of\r\nthe former who have altered their orientation in respect of great\r\ndemocratic principles.\r\n\r\nTo speak of the new school of opinion as a party, moreover, is to\r\noverstate the case as to the relative positions of three small groups of\r\nUnionist opinion, which have little or nothing in common except a joint\r\ndenunciation of the present _régime_.\r\n\r\nThe views of Mr. Russell with regard to compulsory purchase are not, one\r\nsuspects, those of Lord Dunraven. Lord Dunraven's views as to\r\nDevolution, it may be surmised, are too democratic for Sir Horace\r\nPlunkett, and are not sufficiently democratic for Mr. Russell. It is\r\nimpossible to conceive a plan of reform which would enjoy the support of\r\nall these three while the ideas of ameliorative work entertained by the\r\nbody of Orangemen led by Mr. Sloan, who are disgusted by the attitude\r\ntraditionally attached to their order, would, there is no doubt, differ\r\nfrom those of any others. It would be impossible to find a common\r\ndenominator between the views of these modern converts from the old\r\nUnionism which presented an unbending refusal to every demand for reform\r\nand held as sacrosanct the existing state of affairs, constitutional and\r\nsocial.\r\n\r\nThat the numbers of the moderate Unionists of all sections are at\r\npresent small is not surprising. The country has too long been governed\r\nas a dependency, with the Protestant gentry as the _oculus reipublicae_,\r\nfor the \"garrison\" readily to waive that which they have come to look\r\nupon as their inalienable heritage. That the numbers of Orangemen will\r\ngrow small by degrees as a result of land purchase is the general\r\nbelief; but it must not be forgotten that the more violent among them,\r\nin their efforts to rake the ashes; and blow up the cinders of dead\r\nprejudices and extinguished hate, will have the backing of a powerful\r\nPress, the eagerness of the greatest organ of which in this matter in\r\nthe past led to the worst blow its prestige has ever endured. Liberal\r\nstatesmen during the recent general election were constrained to call\r\nattention to the manner in which the power of the Press had been\r\nexploited by a few persons who had endeavoured to secure a \"corner\" in\r\nthose sources of political education, and the obviousness of the policy,\r\nit was admitted, did something to defeat its own ends. Of one thing we\r\nmay be certain, the Orange drum will be beaten once more, for the old\r\nascendancy spirit will die hard; all the devices of artificial\r\nrespiration will be called in to prolong its life, and when it does\r\nbreathe its last one may expect it to do so in the arms of its friends\r\nin an attic in Printing House Square.\r\n\r\nOne can only hope that the \"ultras\" will pitch their tone too high, and\r\nthat their efforts to revive the old perverse antipathies will fail, so\r\nthat Irish Unionists will realise, as some of them are doing already,\r\nthat patriotism, like charity, begins at home, and that they cannot\r\ncompound for distrust of their own countrymen by loud-voiced\r\nprotestations of loyalty to the blessings of British rule.\r\n\r\nIt was very generally admitted that the logical outcome of Mr. Wyndham's\r\nLand Act was an Irish authority to stand between the Irish tenant and\r\nthe British Exchequer, which, under the Act, is left in the invidious\r\nposition of an absentee landlord to people who dislike its ascendancy\r\nand distrust its administrative methods, while an Irish authority with a\r\ndirect interest in the transaction would be able to see that payments\r\nwere punctually made. In the not very likely contingency of failure to\r\ndo this, under the Act as passed, the remedy which lies, is for the\r\nTreasury to stop administrative payments to local bodies, an action\r\nwhich would bring Government to a standstill and plunge the country\r\ninto disaffection. Mr. T.W. Russell has long advocated the creation at\r\nWestminster of a Grand Committee of Irish members to deal with the\r\nEstimates and with Irish legislation; and, as if there were not a\r\nplethora of proposals for the modification of the present system of\r\nGovernment, the plans of the Irish Reform Association have for the last\r\nthree years been before the country.\r\n\r\nThe object of their first proposal is the creation of a Financial\r\nCouncil to which the control of Irish expenditure should be handed by\r\nthe Treasury with the object of making it interested in economising in\r\nfinance for Irish purposes.\r\n\r\nTheir proposal with regard to Private Bill Legislation is merely that\r\nthe principle adopted in 1899 in the case of Scottish Private Bills\r\nshould apply to Ireland, and this has not met with much objection. Under\r\nit local inquiries, which are at present conducted at Westminster, would\r\nbe carried out in the localities affected, with much saving of expense;\r\nand it is only necessary to add that as long ago as 1881 a Bill was\r\nintroduced to transfer from Westminster to Ireland the semi-judicial and\r\nsemi-legislative business entailed in the passage of Private Bills\r\nthrough Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe statutory administrative council proposed by the Irish Reform\r\nAssociation was to consist of thirteen members, of whom six were to be\r\nelected by the County Councils, six were to be the nominees of the\r\nCrown, while the Lord Lieutenant, who was to preside as chairman, was to\r\nhave the right to exercise the privilege of a casting vote. From a\r\ndemocratic point of view such a body would be an assembly _pour rire_,\r\nand would only serve to entrench the present bureaucracy more securely\r\nby the semblance of representation which it would offer, while retaining\r\nthe power of the purse in the hands of a body carefully constituted in\r\nsuch a way that the small minority who comprise the ascendancy faction\r\nin the country would be permanently maintained in a majority on the\r\ncouncil. A great deal more could be said in defence of another proposal\r\nwhich has been mooted--namely, that the principle of proportional\r\nrepresentation should be adopted. In a country like Ireland, where the\r\ndividing line between the two great parties is unusually wide, with an\r\nordinary system of small constituencies, the men of intermediate views\r\nlike those of Mr. Sloan or of the members of the Reform Association\r\nwould, even though they existed in much larger numbers than is the case,\r\nnot secure any great measure of representation, but in comparatively\r\nlarge constituencies this would not be so.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the Nationalists in anticipation of the Government\r\nproposal of last session was expressed by Mr. Redmond, speaking on St.\r\nPatrick's Day at Bradford:--\r\n\r\n\"If the scheme gave the Irish people genuine power and control over\r\nquestions of administration alone, if it left unimpaired the National\r\nmovement and the National Party, and if it lightened the financial\r\nburden under which Ireland staggered, then very possibly Ireland might\r\nseriously consider whether such a scheme ought not to be accepted for\r\nwhat it was worth.\"\r\n\r\nThe Irish Council Bill, as all the world knows, proposed to set up in\r\nDublin an administrative Council, consisting of 82 elected, 24\r\nnominated, members, with the Under Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant as\r\nan _ex officio_ member. This body was to have control over eight of the\r\nforty-five departments which constitute \"Dublin Castle\"--namely, those\r\nrelating to Local Government, Public Works, National Education,\r\nIntermediate Education, the Registrar-General's Office, Public Works,\r\nthe Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction, Congested\r\nDistricts, and Reformatory Schools. The nature of the departments\r\nexcluded from its jurisdiction is of more consequence, including as they\r\ndo the Supreme Court of Judicature, the Royal Irish Constabulary, the\r\nDublin Metropolitan Police, the Land Commission, and the Prisons' Board.\r\n\r\nThe Bill proposed that the Council should be elected triennially on the\r\nsame franchise as that on which local authorities are at present\r\nelected, and its powers were to be exercised by four Committees--of\r\nLocal Government, Finance, Education, and Public Works--the decisions of\r\nwhich were to come up before the Council as a whole, for alteration or\r\napproval. The Bill proposed to constitute an Irish Treasury with an\r\nIrish fund of £4,000,000, made up of the moneys at present voted to the\r\ndepartments concerned, together with an additional £650,000. The sums\r\npaid into this fund were to be fixed by the Imperial Parliament every\r\nfive years. Finally, the resolutions of the Council, by Clause 3 of the\r\nBill, were subject to the confirmation of the Lord Lieutenant, who, by\r\nthe same clause, was to be empowered to reserve such resolutions for his\r\nown consideration, to remit them for further consideration by the\r\nCouncil, or, lastly, \"if in the opinion of the Lord Lieutenant immediate\r\naction is necessary with respect to the matter to which the resolution\r\nrelates, in order to preserve the efficiency of the service, or to\r\nprevent public or private injury, the Lord Lieutenant may make such\r\norder with respect to the matter as in his opinion the necessity of the\r\ncase requires, and any order so made shall have the same effect and\r\noperate in the same manner as if it were the resolution of the Irish\r\nCouncil.\"\r\n\r\nThese were the provisions of the measure which the Liberals introduced\r\nto the disappointment of their Unionist opponents, who had foretold that\r\nit would be a Home Rule Bill under some form of alias, intended to dupe\r\nthe predominant partner. It is to be noted that in 1885 Mr. Chamberlain\r\nmade a proposal which was on the same lines as this, but went further in\r\none respect--that there was no nominated element on the Board which he\r\nproposed to create, and furthermore, the powers of the departments would\r\nunder it have been transferred to a single elective Board, whereas under\r\nthe Council Bill the departments were to be suffered to continue, albeit\r\nunder control. Lord Randolph Churchill was prepared at the time of Mr.\r\nChamberlain's proposal to give even more than the latter wished to\r\nconcede, but both proposals were forgotten on the announcement by Mr.\r\nGladstone of his intention to legislate on a comprehensive basis.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of Mr. Redmond on the first reading of the Bill has been so\r\ngrossly misrepresented by the English Press, both Liberal and\r\nConservative, which published only carefully-prepared epitomes of his\r\nspeech, that it is necessary that one should devote some attention to\r\nwhat he actually said. After asserting that no one could expect him or\r\nhis colleagues--until they had the actual Bill in their hand and had\r\ntime to consider every portion of the scheme, and to elicit Irish public\r\nopinion with reference to it--to offer a deliberate or final judgment,\r\nMr. Redmond went on to reaffirm what the Irish people have long\r\nconsidered the minimum demand which can satisfy their aspirations, and\r\ndeclared that since the measure was introduced as neither a substitute\r\nnor an alternative for Home Rule, he would proceed to consider its\r\nterms. \"Does the scheme,\" the Irish leader went on to ask, \"give a\r\ngenuine and effective control to Irish public opinion over those matters\r\nof administration referred to the Council? If not the scheme is worse\r\nthan useless.\" After protesting strongly against the nominated element\r\nin the Council as being undemocratic, Mr. Redmond went on to express his\r\nwillingness \"to accept it or any other safeguard that the wit of man\r\ncould devise, consistent with the ordinary principles of representative\r\ngovernment, which is necessary to show the minority in Ireland that\r\ntheir fears are groundless.\" He then proceeded strongly to criticise\r\nthe power of the Lord Lieutenant under Clause 3--a power not confined to\r\na mere exercise of veto such as is possessed by a colonial governor, but\r\nsomething much more than this--\"a power on the part of the Lord\r\nLieutenant to interfere with and thwart every single act, so that a\r\nhostile Lord Lieutenant might stop the whole machine. If that was the\r\nintention of the Government it destroyed the valuable and genuine\r\ncharacter of the power given to the Council.\" Having protested against\r\nthe proposal that the Chairmen of Committees were to be the nominees of\r\nthe Lord Lieutenant, and, therefore, not necessarily in sympathy with\r\nthe majority of the Council, Mr. Redmond went on to say:--\"The whole\r\nquestion hinges on whether the finance is adequate. The money grant is\r\nludicrously inadequate. I fear that the £650,000 would be mortgaged from\r\nthe day the measure passed, and that it would be impossible with such an\r\namount to work the scheme.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Redmond then concluded his speech with the paragraph to which most\r\nprominence was given in the English Press, with a view to suggest that\r\nhe accepted, with only minor reservations, the proposals of the\r\nGovernment. I quote it _in extenso_ to show how slender is the ground\r\nfor this imputation:--\r\n\r\n\"I am most anxious to find, if I can, in this scheme an instrument\r\nwhich, while admittedly it will not solve the Irish problem, will, at\r\nany rate, remove some of the most glaring and palpable causes which keep\r\nIreland poverty-stricken and Irishmen hopeless and disaffected. It is in\r\nthat spirit that my colleagues and I will address ourselves to the Bill.\r\nWe shrink from the responsibility of rejecting anything which after the\r\nfull consideration which this Bill will secure, seems to our deliberate\r\njudgment calculated to ease the suffering of Ireland, and hasten the day\r\nof full convalescence.\"[27]\r\n\r\nNo one can suggest, in view of these words, that Mr. Redmond committed\r\nhimself or his colleagues to anything further than to consider the Bill\r\nin a critical but not a hostile spirit. As to the suggestion that a vote\r\nfor the first reading and the printing of the Bill in any sense involved\r\nthe party in even a modified acceptance of the measure, in doing so the\r\nIrish members were acting in fulfilment of a pledge given by Mr. Redmond\r\nsix months before, when, speaking on September 23rd, he said:--\r\n\r\n\"When the scheme is produced it will be anxiously and carefully\r\nexamined. It will be submitted to the judgment of the Irish people, and\r\nno decision will be come to, whether by me or by the Irish Party, until\r\nthe whole question has been submitted to a National Convention. When the\r\nhour of that Convention comes any influence which I possess with my\r\nfellow-countrymen will be used to induce them firmly to reject any\r\nproposal, no matter how plausible, which, in my judgment, may be\r\ncalculated to injure the prestige of the Irish Party and disrupt the\r\nNational movement, because my first and my greatest policy, which\r\novershadows everything else, is to preserve a united National Party in\r\nParliament, and a United powerful organisation in Ireland, until we have\r\nachieved the full measure of National freedom to which we are entitled.\"\r\n\r\nIf the Irish Party had not voted for the first reading we should have\r\nbeen told by their critics that their action was a despotic attempt to\r\noverride and smother the freely-expressed opinions of the Irish people,\r\nbut it must not be forgotten that it is due to Mr. Redmond's own\r\ninitiative that in the case of this Bill, as in the case of the Land\r\nBill of 1903, the final decision has rested, not, as in the case of the\r\nHome Rule Bills of 1886 and 1893, with the members of the Parliamentary\r\nParty, but, by a sort of referendum, with a National Convention\r\ncontaining representative Irishmen elected for the purpose from every\r\npart of the country in the most democratic manner. It is worthy of\r\nattention that the very people who five years ago were declaring in\r\nGreat Britain that Home Rule was dead and damned were those who were\r\nloudest during the general election in the attempt to raise latent\r\nprejudice on that score, and to bring it to pass that the condition of\r\nthings existing twenty years ago was repeated when, as Lord Salisbury\r\ndeclared in a speech to the National Conservative Club, \"all the\r\npolitics of the moment are summarised in the one word--Ireland.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of these facts, Mr. Balfour, speaking on the first reading of\r\nthe Council Bill, was constrained to admit that it bore no resemblance\r\nto any plan which the Irish people had ever advocated, and he went on to\r\ndeclare his inability to see how by any process of development it was\r\ncapable of being turned into anything which the Nationalists ever\r\ncontemplated. The unanimity with which the Bill was repudiated by\r\nNationalist public opinion in Ireland is to be seen from the fact that\r\nnot a single voice was raised on its behalf at the National Convention,\r\ncomprising 3,000 delegates, which was the most representative meeting of\r\nany kind which has ever been held in Ireland. The reasons for its\r\nrejection are to be read in the light of the repeatedly expressed\r\nopinions of the more radical section of the Ministerial Party, to the\r\neffect that a bolder and more comprehensive scheme might have been well\r\nintroduced without any infringement of the election pledges of the\r\nGovernment. Under Clause 3 the Lord Lieutenant, an officer under the new\r\n_régime_, as now, of a British Ministry, would have been empowered to\r\nact in defiance of the opinion of the Council either by modifying their\r\nresolutions as to Executive action or by overriding them by orders of\r\nhis own, or rather of the Ministry of which he was a member. On points\r\nsuch as this dealing with the constitution of the assembly, Mr. Redmond\r\nwas able to inform the Convention that no amendments would be accepted\r\nby the Government, and experience has taught Irishmen that although\r\nthese powers might generally, under a Liberal Government, be exercised\r\nin a legitimate manner, under a Unionist Lord Lieutenant they would be\r\nexercised in a despotic fashion, just as, in the words of the Estates\r\nCommissioners themselves, the instructions issued by the Lord Lieutenant\r\nin February, 1905, were designed \"seriously to impede the expeditious\r\nworking of the Land Act of 1903.\" Great objection was taken to the fact\r\nthat the resources of the Council would be such as to effect little\r\nadministrative improvement, since the departments under its control were\r\nthe very bodies which demanded increased expenditure, while it left\r\nuntouched the Police, the Prisons' Board, and the Judiciary, the\r\nreckless extravagance of which afforded obvious sources from which, by\r\nmodification of their wasteful expense, one could make large economies\r\nfor the benefit of those portions of the Irish service which at the\r\npresent moment are starved.\r\n\r\nThough it may be said that the acceptance of the Bill without prejudice\r\nwould not have stultified the principles already vindicated in a long\r\nstruggle by the Irish people, the body as constituted, it was felt,\r\nwould have served the purpose of the Unionist party by dividing without\r\na sufficient _quid pro quo_ the attention of the Irish people from their\r\ndevotion to the cause for the broad principles of which they have been\r\nstriving, and there was this further danger that a body so restricted in\r\nits scope and anti-democratic in its administration would have broken\r\ndown in action, and would have in this way provided Unionists with the\r\nvery strongest possible argument for opposition to a full autonomy.\r\n\r\nWhile a certain proportion of Liberals are prepared to admit that the\r\nBill made havoc of Liberal principles there is a Laodicean section who\r\nhave greatly blamed Irish Nationalists for having refused what was\r\noffered them, when having asked for bread they were given a stone. To\r\nsuch people as I have in mind I should like to quote what Mr. Gladstone\r\nwrote to Lord Hartington on November 10th, 1885:--\r\n\r\n\"If that consummation--the concession to Ireland of full power to manage\r\nher own local affairs--is in any way to be contemplated, action at a\r\nstroke will be more honourable, less unsafe, less uneasy than the\r\njolting process of a series of partial measures.\"[28]\r\n\r\nThe position of that section of Liberals is strange which is represented\r\nby the assertion that their party has already made enough sacrifices in\r\nregard to Irish affairs, and which is anxious to return to the _laissez\r\nfaire_ policy of their mid-Victorian predecessors. The point I submit is\r\nthis, either Liberals do or they do not believe in the principle of\r\nself-government as applied to Ireland, and if they do adhere to it no\r\neffort is too great, no difficulty too extreme, for them to face in the\r\nattempt to solve so serious a problem. Those who think that because in\r\n1886, and again in 1893, the Liberals, with Irish support,\r\nunsuccessfully attempted to solve the Irish question, they have thereby\r\ncontracted out of their moral obligation, take a very curious view of\r\nthe responsibilities of popular government; but it is not so strange as\r\nthe position of those who hold that because in 1907 the Irish people\r\nrefused a particular form of change in the methods of government for\r\nwhich they never asked, they have in consequence closed every avenue to\r\nconstitutional reform which can be opened for many years.\r\n\r\nIn politics it is often the unexpected that happens, and he would be a\r\nbold prophet who should declare it impossible that within a few years\r\nLiberals may not return _in toto_ to the advocacy of sound principles in\r\nregard to Ireland, the abandonment of which is to be traced to the\r\nrecrudescence of Whiggism after Mr. Gladstone's death and the desire to\r\nfind some line of policy which might be pilloried as a scapegoat to\r\naccount for the disgust of the country with a divided party in the years\r\nfollowing 1895. Liberalism, for its part, if it is to settle the\r\nproblem, must fully appreciate the fact that its proposals, if they are\r\nto succeed, must be accepted with the full concurrence of the Irish\r\nrepresentative majority, and on the part of Irishmen what is demanded is\r\na recognition of the results of the dispensation which has placed the\r\ntwo islands side by side; by these means only can a practicable policy\r\nbe ensured, but it must be remembered with regard to those in Ireland\r\nwho hold extreme views, that the continuance of the system of government\r\nwhich holds the field, and the financial burden at the expense of\r\nIreland which it perpetuates, serve increasingly to obscure and at the\r\nsame time to counteract the advantages accruing from the connection\r\nbetween the two countries, which one may hope would, in happier\r\ncircumstances, be obvious.\r\n\r\nThe Irish people still appreciate the force of that maxim of Edmund\r\nBurke's, that the things which are not practicable are not desirable.\r\nWhile they claim that as of right they are entitled to demand a\r\nseparation of the bonds, to the forging of which they were not\r\nconsenting parties, as practical men they are prepared loyally to abide\r\nby a compromise which will maintain the union of the crowns while\r\nseparating the Legislatures. An international contract leaving them an\r\nindependent Parliament with an Executive responsible to it, having\r\ncontrol over domestic affairs, is their demand. Grattan's constitution\r\ncomprised a sovereign Parliament with a non-Parliamentary Executive, in\r\nso far as the latter was appointed and dismissed by English Ministers.\r\nThe constitution which is demanded to-day is the same as that enjoyed by\r\nsuch a colony as Victoria, with a non-sovereign Parliament, having, that\r\nis, a definite limit to its legislative powers, such as those under the\r\nBill of 1886 referring to Church Establishment and Customs, but having\r\nan Executive directly responsible to it.\r\n\r\nThe case of the Irish people has never been put with more clearness and\r\nfrankness than it was by Mr. Redmond in the House of Commons two years\r\nago. Having been accused by Unionists of adopting a more extreme line\r\noutside Parliament than that which he followed at St. Stephen's, the\r\nIrish leader in reply, after declaring that separation from Great\r\nBritain would be better than a continuance of the present method of\r\ngovernment, and that he should feel bound to recommend armed revolt if\r\nthere were any chance of its success, went on to say:--\r\n\r\n\"I am profoundly convinced that by constitutional means, and within the\r\nconstitution, it is possible to arrive at a compromise based upon the\r\nconcession of self-government--or, as Mr. Gladstone used to call it,\r\nautonomy--to Ireland, which would put an end to this ancient\r\ninternational quarrel upon terms satisfactory and honourable to both\r\nnations.\"\r\n\r\nAn Orangeman described the late Government as being engaged in the\r\nuseless task of trying to conciliate those who will not be conciliated.\r\nThe words of Mr. Redmond indicate the one way in which a _Pacata\r\nHibernia_ can be secured within the Empire. It is a compromise, but it\r\nhas this one virtue which compromises rarely possess--that it will\r\nsatisfy the great mass of the Irish people, and it concedes, as we hold,\r\nno vital principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n     \"Unsettled questions have no pity for the repose of nations.\"\r\n\r\n     --EDMUND BURKE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe position of the mass of the Irish people with regard to the present\r\nform of government has nowhere been more cogently expressed than in the\r\nchapter on the Union in the \"Cambridge Modern History,\" the writer of\r\nwhich describes it as a settlement by compulsion, not by consent; and\r\nthe penalty of such methods is, that the instrument possesses no moral\r\nvalidity for those who do not accept the grounds on which it was\r\nadopted. If Englishmen get this firmly fixed in their minds they will\r\nunderstand that we regard all Unionist reforms, whether from Liberal or\r\nConservative Governments, as instalments of conscience money, in regard\r\nto which, granting our premises, it would be sheer affectation to\r\nexpress surprise or to feign disgust at the lack of effusive gratitude\r\nwith which we receive them. \"Give us back our ancient liberties\" has\r\nbeen the cry of the Irish people ever since George III. gave his assent\r\nto the Act of Union. The ties of sentiment which bind her colonies so\r\nclosely to Great Britain are conspicuous by their absence in the case of\r\nIreland. The ties of common interest which are not less strong in the\r\nmatter of her colonial possessions are, albeit in existence as far as\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland are concerned, obscured and vitiated by the\r\nsystem of taxation which makes the poorer country contribute to the\r\njoint expenses at a rate altogether disproportionate to her means, and\r\nwhich, while making her in this wise pay the piper, in no sense allows\r\nher to call the tune.\r\n\r\nNever has there been applied in Ireland that doctrine which the _Times_\r\nenunciated so sententiously half a century ago in speaking of the Papal\r\nStates--\"The destiny of a nation ought to be determined not by the\r\nopinions of other nations but by the opinion of the nation itself. To\r\ndecide whether they are well governed or not is for those who live under\r\nthat government.\" If the _Times_ were to apply the wisdom of these words\r\nto the situation in Ireland instead of screaming \"Separatism\" at every\r\nbreath of a suggestion of the extension of democratic principles in\r\nIreland, it would take steps to secure a condition of things under which\r\nthe people would not be alienated and would be a source of strength and\r\nnot of weakness.\r\n\r\nWriting in that paper in 1880, at a time when Ireland was seething with\r\nlawlessness, Charles Gordon declared--\"I must say that the state of our\r\ncountrymen in the parts I have named is worse than that of any people in\r\nthe world, let alone Europe. I believe that these people are made as we\r\nare, that they are patient beyond belief, loyal but broken-spirited and\r\ndesperate; lying on the verge of starvation where we would not keep\r\ncattle.\"\r\n\r\nOn the day after the murder of Mr. Burke in the Phoenix Park a permanent\r\nCivil Servant was sent straight from the admiralty to take his place as\r\nUnder Secretary. Sir Robert Hamilton who served in Dublin in those\r\ntrying conditions became a convinced Home Ruler, as did his chief, Lord\r\nSpencer; and it is generally said to have been Sir Robert who converted\r\nMr. Gladstone to Home Rule. On the return to power of the Conservatives,\r\nafter the defeat of the Home Rule Bill of 1886, Sir Robert Hamilton was\r\nretired, and in his stead Sir Redvers Buller was sent to rule Ireland\r\n_manu militari_. This officer, on being examined by Lord Cowper's\r\nCommission, expressed his opinion that the National League had been the\r\ntenants' best, if not their only, friend. \"You have got,\" he said, \"a\r\nvery ignorant, poor people, and the law should look after them, instead\r\nof which it has only looked after the rich.\" To hold opinions so\r\nunconventional in the service of a Unionist Viceroy was impossible, and\r\nin a year other fields for Sir Redvers' activities were found. Sir West\r\nRidgeway, who succeeded him, served as Mr. Balfour's lieutenant during\r\nthe latter's efforts to \"kill Home Rule with kindness,\" and it is\r\nsignificant to find him at this day writing articles in the reviews on\r\nthe disappearance of Unionism, and pinning his faith to Dunravenism as\r\nthe next move.\r\n\r\nIt is assuredly a remarkable fact that the shrewdest of English\r\nstatesmen have not been able to see the complication with which the\r\nIrish problem is entangled. Macaulay imagined that the religious\r\ndifficulty was the crux of the Irish question, but Emancipation did not\r\nbring the expected peace and contentment in its train. John Bright\r\nimagined that the agrarian question was the only obstacle to\r\nreconciliation, but a recognition three-quarters of a century after the\r\nUnion that the laws of tenure are made for man and not man for the laws\r\nof tenure, failed to put an end to Irish disaffection. Mr. Gladstone\r\nthought in 1870 that the Irish problem was solved. Complicated as the\r\nquestion has been in its various aspects--religious, racial, economic,\r\nand agrarian--our demands have too often and too long been met in the\r\nspirit of the Levite who passed by on the other side, until violence has\r\nforced tardy redress, acquiesced in with reluctance. If the action of\r\nWellington and Peel was pusillanimous in granting Emancipation, for the\r\nexpress purpose of resisting which they were placed in power, backed as\r\nthey were in their refusal by their allies in Ireland, the next great\r\nmeasures of reform forty years later were admitted by Mr. Gladstone\r\nhimself to be equally the result of violence and breaches of the law.\r\nThe Queen's Speech of 1880 contained but a passing reference to Ireland\r\nand of the intention of the Government to rule without exceptional\r\nlegislation; the Queen's Speech of 1881 contained reference to little\r\nbut Ireland and of the intention of the Government to introduce a\r\nCoercion Bill.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1885, Lord Salisbury's Viceroy, on taking office, deprecated\r\nthe use of Coercion, but in January, 1886, the same Government\r\nintroduced a Coercion Bill, though less than six months before they had\r\nrepudiated it, and had beaten the Liberal Government on this very issue\r\nwith the aid of the Irish vote. The manner in which both English parties\r\nhave eaten their words is warranted to inculcate political cynicism. If\r\nin 1881 the Liberals are declared to have jettisoned their principles\r\nand to have perpetrated that which a few months before they declared\r\nwould stultify their whole policy, the same damaging admission must be\r\nmade by the Tories as to their acquiescence in the Franchise Bill of\r\n1884 and their conduct of the Land Bill of 1887.\r\n\r\n\"Anyone,\" said Cavour, \"can govern in a state of siege,\" but I do not\r\nthink Englishmen realise the extent to which the ruling policy has been\r\nto accentuate the repressive to the exclusion of the beneficent side of\r\ngovernment, and how ready they have been to make the government not one\r\nof opinion, as in their own country, but one of force. When Mr. Balfour\r\nintroduced his perpetual Coercion Bill of 1887 it was estimated that\r\nthere had been one such measure for every year of the century that was\r\npassing.\r\n\r\nIn the first instance, the institutions of Ireland, being imposed by a\r\nconquering country, never earned that measure of respect bred partly of\r\npride which attaches itself to the self-sown customs and processes of\r\nnations; but, having introduced her legal system, England superseded it\r\nand took steps to rule by a code outside the Common Law, so that respect\r\nwas, therefore, asked for legal institutions which, on her own showing,\r\nand by her own admissions, had proved inadequate. In Ireland Government\r\ndid not \"meet the headlong violence of angry power by covering the\r\naccused all over with the armour of the law,\" as in Erskine's famous\r\nphrase it did in England with regard to those imbued with revolutionary\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nA rusty statute of Edward III., which was devised for the suppression of\r\nbrigandage, was used to condemn the leaders of the Irish people,\r\nunheard, in a court of law. Trial by jury was suspended and the common\r\nright of freedom of speech was infringed. In 1901 no less than ten\r\nMembers of Parliament were imprisoned under the Crimes Act, and it was\r\nnot until the appointment of Sir Antony MacDonnell to the Under\r\nSecretaryship that the proclamation of the Coercion Act was withdrawn.\r\n\r\nIt is no small matter that Mr. Bryce, when reviewing his period of\r\noffice, mentioned among the details of his policy that he had set his\r\nface against jury-packing, and had allowed juries to be chosen perfectly\r\nfreely. The suspension of the most cherished Common Law rights of the\r\nsubject from Habeas Corpus downwards has been the inevitable result of a\r\nfailure to apply democratic principles of government. Jury-packing,\r\nforbidden meetings, summary arrests and prosecutions, and police\r\nreporters form a discreditable paraphernalia by which to maintain the\r\nconduct of government.\r\n\r\nAs examples of the differential treatment meted out to Ireland which is\r\nnot of a nature to impress her with confidence in English methods may be\r\nmentioned the fact that the Irish militia are drafted out of the country\r\nfor their training, that no citizen army of volunteers is permitted, and\r\nthe desire of one faction to preserve these discriminations is to be\r\nseen in the anger with which was greeted the omission the other day of\r\nthe Irish Arms Act from the Expiring Laws Continuation Bill.\r\n\r\nUnder every bad government there arise popular organisations bred of the\r\nwildness of despair which enjoy the moral sanction which the law has\r\nfailed to secure \"When citizens,\" said Filangieri long ago, \"see the\r\nSword of Justice idle they snatch a dagger.\" So long as the Government\r\nsate on the safety valve, so long did periodic explosions of\r\nrevolutionary resentment arise, and one must appreciate the fact that in\r\na country so devoutly Catholic as is Ireland the natural conservatism\r\nwhich attachment to an historic Church inculcates, and the direction on\r\nits part of anathemas at secret societies and at violence, served to\r\nmake it more difficult by far to arouse revolutionary reprisals than it\r\nwould be in similar circumstances in England.\r\n\r\n\"When bad men combine,\" wrote Edmund Burke, \"the good must associate,\r\nelse they will fall one by one an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible\r\nstruggle.\" No one can accuse Burke--the apostle of constitutionalism,\r\nthe arch-enemy of the French revolution--of condoning violence, but even\r\nhe admitted that there is a limit at which forbearance ceases to be a\r\nvirtue.\r\n\r\nEngland must blame herself for the war of classes with which the\r\nNational struggle has been complicated. It was the Act of Union which\r\nmade the landlord class look to England, and established it in the\r\nanomalous position of a body drawing its income from one country and its\r\nsupport from another; by this means it made them a veritable English\r\ngarrison appealing to England as being the only loyal people. Let us\r\nhope it is not true to say at this date that like the Bourbons they have\r\nlearnt nothing and forgotten nothing. The rich, the proud, and the\r\npowerful have had their day, and can one deny that the attempt to govern\r\nIreland in the sole interests of a minority has made Ireland what it is.\r\nAn unbiased French observer three-quarters of a century ago declared\r\nthat the cause of Irish distress was its _mauvaise aristocratic_. It was\r\nthe interest of this class, as they themselves admit, which was allowed\r\nto dominate the policy of the Unionist Party, and to effect this, force\r\nwas the only available instrument. With the recognition of the fact that\r\nthe possession of property is no guarantee of intelligence has come the\r\ncrippling of the policy of _laissez faire_, supported though it was by\r\nthe brewers of Dublin and the shipbuilders of Belfast, for this\r\nreason--that rich men tend always to rally to the defence of property.\r\nThe exercise of the duties which property imposes and the responsibility\r\nwhich it entails being the chief advantages of a landed gentry, and\r\ntheir main _raison d'être_ as a ruling caste having been conspicuous by\r\nits absence, with few exceptions, in Ireland, the passing of the\r\nlandowner as a social factor is looked upon with complacency.\r\n\r\nEnglish statesmen seem to have applied that maxim of Machiavelli--that\r\nbenefits should be conferred little by little so as to be more fully\r\nappreciated. It is hard to realise that little more than thirty years\r\nhave elapsed since the time when the landed interest was supreme in\r\nthese islands. Their power was first assailed by the Ballot Act of 1873,\r\nand the Corrupt Practices Act of 1884 did much to put a term to a form\r\nof intimidation at which Tories did not hold up their hands in horror,\r\nwhile the Franchise Act of 1883 destroyed their power, so that in those\r\nyears passed away for ever the time when, as Archbishop Croke put it, an\r\nIrish borough would elect Barabbas for thirty pieces of silver.\r\n\r\nOf one thing, indeed, we may be certain, and that is that we have\r\ntouched bottom in the matter of Unionist concessions. The manner in\r\nwhich the programme mapped out between Mr. Wyndham and Sir Antony\r\nMacDonnell was rendered nugatory is evidence of that. The administration\r\nof the Land Act, under the secret instructions issued by Dublin Castle,\r\nwas such as to cripple the Estates Commissioners in their application of\r\nits provisions. The proposals as to the settlement of the University\r\nquestion were nipped in the bud after advances had been made to the\r\nCatholic bishops to discover what was the minimum which they would\r\naccept, and this was done although Mr. Balfour had declared at\r\nManchester in 1899--\"Unless the University question can be settled\r\nUnionism is a failure.\"\r\n\r\nMr. F.H. Dale, an English Inspector of Schools, who, in the last couple\r\nof years, has produced two comprehensive blue books on the state of\r\nprimary and secondary education in Ireland, declared that he found the\r\ndesire for higher education in Ireland greater than in England; but in\r\nspite of this, so far, neither British party has advanced one step in\r\nthe direction of a permanent solution, pleading as excuse that the fear\r\nof strengthening the hands of the priests blocks the way, albeit a\r\nuniversity under predominatingly lay control is all that even the\r\nhierarchy in Ireland demand; while to add to the groundlessness on which\r\nintolerance is based the only institution of a satisfactory kind which\r\nis endowed by the State is a Jesuit College supported by what one can\r\nonly call circuitous means.\r\n\r\nMr. Balfour himself has admitted that no Protestant parent could\r\nconscientiously send his son to a college which was as Catholic as\r\nTrinity is Protestant. If Oxford and Cambridge had been founded by\r\nforeign Catholics for the express purpose of destroying the Protestant\r\nreligion in England, a thirty years' abolition of tests, which in no\r\nsense affected their \"atmosphere,\" would not have overcome the prejudice\r\nand scruples persisting against them.\r\n\r\nThe vicious circles round which Irish questions rotate is nowhere seen\r\nmore clearly than in this connection. When complaint is made that a\r\ndisproportionately small number of Catholics hold high appointments in\r\nthe public offices in Ireland, the reply is made that the number of\r\nmembers of that Church with high educational qualifications is small;\r\nwhen demands are made for facilities for higher education, the\r\nreluctance of English people to publicly endow sectarian education is\r\nurged as an excuse, although Irishmen have not, since Trinity abolished\r\ntests, made any demands for a purely sectarian University or College.\r\n\r\nI have shown how, as a result of our aloofness from both English\r\nparties, we find ourselves between the upper and the nether millstones,\r\nand in what way in regard to the University question the old error which\r\nfor so long obstructed the land question is at work--mean the error of\r\ndenying reform for English reasons and endeavouring to force English\r\ndoctrines into the law and government of Ireland and of suppressing\r\nIrish customs and Irish ideas.\r\n\r\nOn the advent to power of the present Government the heads of the great\r\ndepartments in Whitehall excused their apparent dilatoriness in\r\neffecting those administrative changes which the country expected from a\r\nLiberal Government, by the fact that after twenty years of Conservative\r\nrule the permanent officials were so steeped in the methods of Toryism\r\ntheir habits were to such a degree tinged and coloured by its policy,\r\nthat there was the greatest possible difficulty in making the necessary\r\nalterations. In the case of Ireland this is so to a much greater extent,\r\nand one must recognise the truth of that saying of some Irish member to\r\nthe effect that a new Chief Secretary was like the change of the dial on\r\na clock--the difference was not great, for the works remain the same.\r\n\r\nThe main arguments against reform are founded on prophetic fears, and if\r\none is impressed by the threats of a _jacquerie_ on the part of the\r\nOrangemen, led though they may be again, as they were twenty years ago,\r\nby a Minister of Cabinet rank, Nationalists, on the other hand, may\r\nremind Englishmen that the Irish volcanoes are not yet extinct, and that\r\nthe history of reform is such as to show the value of violence on the\r\nfailure of peaceful persuasion--a feature the most lamentable in Irish\r\npolitics; and in this connection let it never be forgotten that \"the\r\nwarnings of Irish members,\" as Mr. Morley wrote in the _Pall Mall\r\nGazette_ on the introduction of the Coercion Bill which followed the\r\nPhoenix Park murders, \"have a most unpleasant knack of coming true.\"\r\nWhen the counsels of prudence coincide with the claims of justice,\r\nsurely the last word had been said to disarm opposition.\r\n\r\n\"Old Buckshot,\" said Parnell grimly enough in 1881, \"thinks that by\r\nmaking Ireland a gaol he will settle the Irish question.\" Throwing\r\nover that theory Great Britain decided in 1884--in the phrase then\r\ncurrent--that to count heads was better than to break them, but having\r\ncounted them she ignored their verdict, and has continued so to do for\r\nmore than twenty years. One would have thought that she would have\r\napplied the rigour of her theories and put an end to this travesty by\r\nwhich she has conceded the letter of democracy--a phantom privilege\r\nwhich she has rendered nugatory. It was the impossibility of ignoring\r\nthe constitutionally-expressed wishes of the Irish people after he had\r\nextended the suffrage, which made Mr. Gladstone a Home Ruler, and\r\nEnglishmen have to remember that this, the only remedy in the whole of\r\ntheir political materia medica which they have not tried, is the one\r\nwhich has effected a cure wherever else it has been applied.\r\n\r\nI ask, to what does England look forward in a prolongation of the\r\npresent conditions? There is no finality in the politics of Ireland any\r\nmore than in those of other countries. She cannot say to Ireland--\"Thus\r\nfar shalt thou go, and no further.\" As one burning question is solved\r\nanother arises to take its place and to demand redress. The battle for\r\nthe moment may seem to be to the strong, but in the long run might is\r\nunable to resist the advances of right. Time, we may well declare, is on\r\nour side; but one has to count the cost in the material damage to us,\r\nand in the moral damage to Great Britain, in the ultimate concession,\r\nperhaps under duress, of so much which has repeatedly been refused.\r\nEver since, in 1881, Mr. Gladstone \"banished to Saturn the laws of\r\npolitical economy,\" strong measures of State socialism have been enacted\r\nby both parties. It is not for nothing that the tenants in the West find\r\nthemselves to-day paying less than half for their holdings of what they\r\npaid twenty years ago, and paying it, moreover, not by way of rent but\r\nas a terminable annuity. If there is one point which the events of the\r\nlast generation have established in their eyes it is this--that Parnell\r\nwas justified in telling them to keep a firm grip of their holdings, and\r\nthat Great Britain has admitted the justice of the grounds on which\r\ntheir agitation was based, by the revolution in the social fabric which\r\nshe has set in train by the Land Purchase Acts.\r\n\r\nWho was the witty Frenchman who declared that England was an island and\r\nthat every Englishman was an island? It is not only because of this\r\npreoccupation with their own affairs that their _amour propre_ has been\r\ninjured by their failure in Ireland. One cannot expect to gather figs\r\nfrom thistles or grapes from thorns, and when Englishmen appreciate to\r\nhow small an extent the Union has enured to the advantage of Ireland,\r\nthey will understand the feelings which actuate the desire for\r\nself-government. Is there anything which makes Englishmen believe that\r\nthe extension of Land Purchase or the foundation of a university will\r\nmake for a permanent settlement? The history of the last half century\r\ncan scarcely make them sanguine that when the burning questions of\r\nto-day have been disposed of they will find in the Imperial Parliament\r\nthe knowledge, the interest, or the time necessary for dealing with new\r\nquestions as they arise--for arise they assuredly will.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain may legislate with lazy, ill-informed, good intentions, as\r\nMr. Gladstone admitted was done in the case of the Encumbered Estates\r\nAct, or she may grant concessions piecemeal, and the minority which\r\nthereby she maintains will denounce every reform as mere _panem et\r\ncircenses_ by which she hopes to keep the majority subdued.\r\n\r\nThe \"loyal minority\" have cried \"wolf\" too often. Nearly forty years\r\nago, when Disestablishment was threatened, the Protestant Archbishop of\r\nDublin said--\"You will put to Irish Protestants the choice between\r\napostacy and expatriation, and every man among them who has money or\r\nposition, when he sees his Church go, will leave the country. If you do\r\nthat, you will find Ireland so difficult to manage that you will have to\r\ndepend on the gibbet and the sword.\"\r\n\r\nThe twenty-five attempts to settle by legislation the land question were\r\nin nearly every instance denounced as spoliation by the House of Lords,\r\nwhich was constrained to let them pass into law. The pages of Hansard\r\nare grey with unfulfilled forebodings as to what would be the effect of\r\nthe extension of the Franchise and of the grant of popular Local\r\nGovernment.

If there is any man\r\n     living and writing for the stage with youth on his side and\r\n     the future before him, it is John Synge, whose four plays....\r\n     represent accomplishment of the highest order. It is true that\r\n     these dramas do deal only with peasants, but they are handled\r\n     in the universal way that Ibsen used when he made the\r\n     bourgeois of slow Norwegian towns representative of the human\r\n     race everywhere.... it is not only in the avoidance of\r\n     joyless and pallid words that Mr. Synge has chosen the better\r\n     part. He has experienced the rich joy found only in what is\r\n     superb and wild in reality; and so it was just because 'The\r\n     Playboy' was so true in its presentation of the weaknesses--if\r\n     weaknesses they can be called--as well as the strength of his\r\n     men and women, that a furore was raised against it as a sort\r\n     of satire.... The sympathy of the dramatist with his people\r\n     makes itself felt in spite of his ability to stand apart\r\n     detachment from them.\"--_New York \"Evening Sun.\"_\r\n\r\n     \"'The Aran Islands'.... of vast importance as throwing a\r\n     light on this curious development.... is like no other book\r\n     we have ever read. This is not because the people described in\r\n     it are unique. With the most artful simplicity Mr. Synge gives\r\n     you first a just idea of the alternate beauty and bleakness of\r\n     that wonderful coast, and then makes you see the inhabitants\r\n     in their daily struggle for existence.... This book, with\r\n     its sympathetic insight, is the best possible return that Mr.\r\n     Synge could have made to his friends on the island.\"--_New\r\n     York \"Evening Sun.\"_\r\n\r\n     \"Synge is so real it is impossible to resist him. He seems to\r\n     have the masterful quality of taking a few scattered peasant\r\n     families, and giving to them a universal import.... His\r\n     plays are alive. They are real plays in real persons, and not\r\n     the least of their charm lies in the dialogue....

There\r\n     is cynicism on the surface, but a depth of ardent sympathy and\r\n     imaginative feeling below, and vistas of thought are opened up\r\n     that lead from the West of Ireland shebeen to the stars....

A comedy of amazing\r\n     fidelity to the Irish peasant's gift and passion for a special\r\n     quality of headlong, highly figured speech, that rushes on,\r\n     gathering pace from one stroke of vividness to another still\r\n     wider and better....\"--_Manchester Guardian_.\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Synge ... certainly does possess a very keen sense of\r\n     fact, as well as dramatic power and great charm of style ...\r\n     one of the finest comedies of the dramatic renaissance ...\r\n     sustained dramatic power.... These peasants are poets, as\r\n     certainly they are humorists, without knowing it. Certain\r\n     passages of 'The Playboy' read like parts of the English\r\n     Bible. There is the same direct and spontaneous beauty of\r\n     image.... Mr. Synge has achieved a masterpiece by simply\r\n     collaborating with nature. He and the Irish are to be\r\n     congratulated.\"--Holbrook Jackson (_The New Age_).\r\n\r\n     \"'The Playboy of the Western World' ... is a remarkable play\r\n     ... its imagery is touched with a wild, unruly, sensational\r\n     beauty, and the 'popular imagination that is fiery and\r\n     magnificent and tender' is reflected in it with a glow....\r\n     There is a great deal of poetry and fire, beside the humour\r\n     and satire so obviously intended, in this drama.\"--Francis\r\n     Hackett in _Chicago Evening Post_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WELL OF THE SAINTS.\r\n\r\nA Play in Three Acts.

Cr. 8vo. 6s.\r\n\r\n     This book is the record of a pilgrimage to historic and\r\n     beautiful places in Ireland, so arranged as to give an idea\r\n     not only of their physical aspect to-day, but also of the\r\n     history for which they stand. Places have been chosen whose\r\n     greatest fame was in the days before foreign rule, though\r\n     often, as at the Boyne, they are associated with the later\r\n     story of Ireland. In each chapter the whole range of\r\n     associations is handled, so that each reviews in some measure\r\n     the whole history of Irish civilisation as it concerned one\r\n     particular place. But in a fuller sense the chapters are\r\n     arranged so as to suggest a continuous idea of Irish life,\r\n     from the prehistoric period illustrated by cyclopean\r\n     monuments, down to the full development of purely Irish\r\n     civilisation which is typified by the buildings at Cashel.\r\n     Seats of ancient sovereignty like Tara, or of ancient art and\r\n     learning like Clonmacnoise, are described so as to show what\r\n     the observer can find to see there to-day, and what the\r\n     student can learn from native Irish Poetry and annals\r\n     regarding them.\r\n\r\n\r\nFISHING HOLIDAYS.\r\n\r\nBy STEPHEN GWYNN.

By Mary A. Hutton.\r\n\r\nFcap 4to. Antique Paper. Bound in Irish Linen gilt, gilt top. 10s. 6d.\r\nnet.\r\n\r\n     This work is an attempt to tell the whole story of the Táin Bó\r\n     Cúailngne in a complete and artistic form. The writer, working\r\n     always from original sources, has taken the L.L. text of the\r\n     tale as the basis of her narrative, but much material has been\r\n     worked into its texture, not only from the L.U. version of the\r\n     Táin and fragments of other versions, but from very many other\r\n     Irish epic sources. Some of the material so used has not yet\r\n     been edited. The object always has been to bring out the great\r\n     human interests of the story in their own Gaelic atmosphere.\r\n\r\n     The narrative is divided into fifteen books, and there is a\r\n     short introductory narrative called \"The Finding of the Táin,\"\r\n     and a short closing narrative called \"The Writing of the\r\n     Táin\"; these form a sort of Early Christian frame to the great\r\n     Pagan tale.\r\n\r\n     The medium chosen is blank verse; but the verse, being written\r\n     under the immediate influence of old Gaelic literature, has a\r\n     character of its own.\r\n\r\n     The author has been engaged on the work for the past ten\r\n     years, and, in addition to writing the poem, has compiled a\r\n     series of Appendices, comprising a very complete set of\r\n     topographical notes, an account of the chief authorities used,\r\n     and various other notes and comments. The book should be of\r\n     great interest to scholars and folk-lorists, as well as to\r\n     lovers of poetry, and to all who are interested in the old\r\n     Irish stories.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAMA.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIDDLER'S HOUSE.\r\n\r\nA Play in Three Acts.
