The course which I delivered, at this period, on the\r\nhistory of Representative Government, occupies a place in this\r\ncollection. I did not revise the analyses of my lectures which\r\nwere published. They were brief and incomplete, and frequently\r\nincorrect and confused. I have been requested to authorize a\r\nreprint of them. I could not consent to this without bestowing\r\nupon these analyses, at the present day, that labour of revision\r\nto which they were not subjected at the time of their\r\npublication. The two volumes which I now publish are the result\r\nof this labour, which has been more protracted, and has involved\r\nmore considerable alterations than I at first anticipated. In\r\norder to accomplish it, I have frequently had recourse to my\r\n_Essaies sur l'Histoire de France_, in which I embodied, in\r\n1823, some of my researches on the same subject. This course of\r\nlectures on the origin of Representative Government is now as\r\nexact and complete as if my lectures in 1820-1822 had been\r\ncollected and revised with the same care as I bestowed, in\r\n1827-1830, on the publication of my courses on the General\r\nHistory of Civilization in Europe, and on the History of\r\nCivilization in France.\r\n\r\n{vi}\r\n\r\nWhen, in the year 1820, I devoted my energies to this course of\r\ninstruction, I was taking leave of public life, after having,\r\nduring six years, taken an active part in the work of\r\nestablishing representative government in our own land. The\r\npolitical ideas and friends with whom I had been associated were,\r\nat that period, removed from the head of affairs. I connected\r\nmyself with their reverses, without abandoning our common hopes\r\nand efforts. We had faith in our institutions. Whether they\r\nentailed upon us good or evil fortune, we were equally devoted to\r\nthem. I was unwilling to cease to serve their cause. I\r\nendeavoured to explain the origin and principles of\r\nrepresentative government, as I had attempted to practise it.\r\n\r\nHow shall I speak, at the present day, of bad fortune and\r\nreverse, in reference to 1820? What shall we say of the fate\r\nwhich has recently overtaken our fatherland, and of that which is\r\nperhaps in store for us? It is a shame to make use of the same\r\nwords in respect to evils and dangers so prodigiously unequal. In\r\ntruth, the trials of 1820 were severe and painful, yet the State\r\nwas not thrown into confusion by them, and they were followed by\r\nten years of regular and free government. In 1830, a still\r\nseverer trial, the test of a revolution, was applied to our noble\r\ninstitutions, and they did not succumb; they shook off the\r\nrevolutionary yoke, and gave us eighteen years more of order and\r\nliberty. From 1814 to 1848, notwithstanding so many violent\r\nconvulsions, constitutional monarchy remained standing, and\r\nevents justified the obstinacy of our hopes. But now the storm\r\nhas struck every institution, and still threatens to destroy all\r\nthat survive. Not merely kings and laws, but the very root of\r\ngovernment, of all government--what do I say?--the roots of\r\nsociety itself have been reached, and are left bare and almost\r\ntorn up. Can we again seek safety at the same source? can we\r\nstill believe and hope in representative government and monarchy?\r\n\r\n{vii}\r\n\r\nI have not escaped, any more than other persons, from the anxiety\r\noccasioned by this doubt. Nevertheless, in proportion as the\r\nevents which have weighed upon us, for the last three years, have\r\nreceived development and elucidation--when I beheld society\r\npausing, by an effort of its own, on the verge of that abyss to\r\nwhich it had been brought by its own weakness--I felt the revival\r\nin my soul of that faith and hope which have filled my life, and\r\nwhich, until these last days, have constituted the faith and hope\r\nof our time. Among the infinite illusions of human vanity, we\r\nmust number those of misfortune; whether as peoples or as\r\nindividuals, in public or in private life, we delight to persuade\r\nourselves that our trials are unprecedented, and that we have to\r\nendure evils and to surmount obstacles previously unheard of. How\r\ndeceitful is this consolation of pride in suffering! God has made\r\nthe condition of men, of all men, more severe than they are\r\nwilling to believe; and he causes them, at all times, to\r\npurchase, at a dearer price than they had anticipated, the\r\nsuccess of their labours and the progress of their destiny. Let\r\nus accept this stern law without a murmur; let us courageously\r\npay the price which God puts upon success, instead of basely\r\nrenouncing the hope of success itself. The leading idea, the\r\nnational desire of France, in 1789, was the alliance of free\r\ninstitutions with hereditary monarchy. We have been carried far\r\naway from our design; we have immensely deceived ourselves and\r\ngone astray in our presumptuous hopes; but we should no less\r\ndeceive ourselves in our sceptical despondency. God, who permits\r\nthe burden of their faults to fall upon nations, does not make\r\ntheir own life to be to them a continuous falsehood and a fatal\r\nsnare; our whole history, our entire civilization, all our\r\nglories and our greatness urged and led us onward to the union of\r\nmonarchy and liberty; we have often taken the wrong road in our\r\nway towards our object; and in order to reach it, we shall still\r\nhave to take many new roads and to pass over many difficult\r\nspots. But let our object remain the same; for there lies our\r\nhaven.\r\n\r\n{viii}\r\n\r\nIf I should apply, at the present day, to these historical\r\nstudies of 1820, all the lessons which political life has given\r\nme since that period, I should perhaps modify some of the ideas\r\nwhich I have expressed in reference to some of the conditions and\r\nforms of representative government. This system of government has\r\nno unique and solely good type, in conformity to which it must\r\nnecessarily and universally be instituted. Providence, which\r\nallots to nations different origins and destinies, also opens to\r\njustice and liberty more than one way of entering into\r\ngovernments: and it would be foolishly to reduce their chances of\r\nsuccess if we condemned them to appear always with the same\r\nlineaments, and to develope themselves by the same means. One\r\nthing only is important, and that is, that the essential\r\nprinciples of order and liberty should subsist beneath the\r\ndifferent forms which the interference of the country in its own\r\naffairs may assume amongst different peoples and at different\r\nepochs. These essential and necessary principles of all\r\nrepresentative government are precisely those which, in our days,\r\nare ignored and outraged. I venture to believe that they will be\r\nfound faithfully expounded in these lectures; and that on this\r\naccount, even at the present day, my work will not be devoid\r\neither of utility or of interest.\r\n\r\n    Guizot.\r\n\r\n{ix}\r\n\r\n                   Contents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Part I.\r\n\r\n          Representative Institutions In\r\n           England, France, And Spain,\r\n\r\n      From The Fifth To The Eleventh Century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Lecture I.--Page 1\r\n\r\n  Simultaneous development of history and civilization.\r\n\r\n  Two errors in our method of considering the past; proud\r\n  disdain, or superstitious admiration.\r\n\r\n  Historic impartiality the vocation of the present age.\r\n\r\n  Divisions of the history of the political institutions\r\n  of Europe into four great epochs.\r\n\r\n  Representative government the general and natural aim of\r\n  these institutions.\r\n\r\n  Object of the course; inquiry into the origin of\r\n  representative government in France, Spain, and England.\r\n\r\n  State of mind appropriate to this inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n                Lecture II.--Page 23\r\n\r\n  General character of political institutions in Europe,\r\n  from the fourth to the eleventh century.\r\n\r\n  Political sterility of the Roman Empire.\r\n\r\n  Progress of the Germanic invasions.\r\n\r\n  Sketch of the history of the Anglo-Saxons.\r\n\r\n\r\n               Lecture III.--Page 32\r\n\r\n  Subject of the lecture.\r\n\r\n  A knowledge of the state of persons necessary\r\n  to the proper study of institutions.\r\n\r\n  Essential difference between antiquity and modern societies,\r\n  as regards the classification of social conditions.\r\n\r\n  State of persons among the Anglo-Saxons.\r\n\r\n  Thanes and Ceorls.\r\n\r\n  Central and local institutions.\r\n\r\n  Predominance of the latter among the Anglo-Saxons.\r\n\r\n  Its cause.\r\n\r\n{x}\r\n\r\n               Lecture IV.--Page 41\r\n\r\n  Local institutions among the Anglo-Saxons.\r\n\r\n  Divisions of territory; their origin and double object.\r\n\r\n  Internal police of these local associations.\r\n\r\n  Importance of the county-courts; their composition\r\n  and attributes.\r\n\r\n  Complex origin of the Jury.\r\n\r\n  Central institutions of the Anglo-Saxons.\r\n\r\n  The Wittenagemot; its composition, and the\r\n  principle on which it was based.\r\n\r\n  Increasing preponderance of the large landowners\r\n  in the Anglo-Saxon monarchy.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Lecture V.--Page 49\r\n\r\n  The Wittenagemot; its business and power.\r\n\r\n  Method of its convocation.\r\n\r\n  Vicissitudes of its character and importance.\r\n\r\n  The kingly office among the Anglo-Saxons.\r\n\r\n  Extent and progress of the royal power.\r\n\r\n              Lecture VI.--Page 55\r\n\r\n  The true principle of representative government.\r\n\r\n  Error of classifying governments according to their external\r\n  forms.\r\n\r\n  Montesquieu's error with respect to the origin of the\r\n  representative system.\r\n\r\n  Necessary correlation and simultaneous formation of\r\n  society and government.\r\n\r\n  Rousseau's mistaken hypothesis of the social contract.\r\n\r\n  The nature of rightful sovereignty.\r\n\r\n  Confused and contradictory ideas entertained on this subject.\r\n\r\n  Societies, as individuals, possess the right of being placed\r\n  under laws of justice and reason.\r\n\r\n  Governments ought to be continually reminded of their\r\n  obligation to inquire into and conform to these laws.\r\n\r\n  Classification of governments on this principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Lecture VII.--Page 65\r\n\r\n  Comparison of the principles of different governments with the\r\n  true principle of representative government.\r\n\r\n  Aristocratic governments.\r\n\r\n  Origin and history of the word _aristocracy_.\r\n\r\n  Principle of this form of government; its consequences.\r\n\r\n  How the principle of representative government enters into\r\n  aristocratic governments.\r\n\r\n  Democratic governments.\r\n\r\n  Origin and consequences of the principle of the sovereignty of\r\n  the people.\r\n\r\n  This principle not identical with that of representative\r\n  government.\r\n\r\n  In what sense representative government is the government\r\n  of the majority.\r\n\r\n{xi}\r\n\r\n              Lecture VIII.--Page 76\r\n\r\n  The forms of a government are related to its principle, but are\r\n  swayed by circumstances, and vary according to different\r\n  degrees of civilization.\r\n\r\n  What are the forms essential to a representative government?\r\n\r\n  1st.

Not only does each age receive a vocation to devote\r\nitself especially to a particular region of inquiry; but the same\r\nstudies are to each age as a mine but little explored, or as an\r\nunknown territory where objects for discovery present themselves\r\nat every step. In the study of history this truth is especially\r\napparent.\r\n{2}\r\nThe facts about which history concerns itself neither gain nor\r\nlose anything by being handed down from age to age; whatever we\r\nhave seen in these facts, and whatever we can see, has been\r\ncontained in them ever since they were originally accomplished;\r\nbut they never allow themselves to be fully apprehended, nor\r\npermit all their meaning to be thoroughly investigated; they\r\nhave, so to speak, innumerable secrets, which slowly utter\r\nthemselves after man has become prepared to recognise them. And\r\nas everything in man and around him changes, as the point of view\r\nfrom which he considers the facts of history, and the state of\r\nmind which he brings to the survey, continually vary, we may\r\nspeak of the past as changing with the present; unperceived facts\r\nreveal themselves in ancient facts; other ideas, other feelings,\r\nare called up by the same names and the same narratives; and man\r\nthus learns that in the infinitude of space opened to his\r\nknowledge, everything remains constantly fresh and inexhaustible,\r\nin regard to his ever-active and ever-limited intelligence.\r\n\r\nThis combined view of the greatness of events and the feebleness\r\nof the human mind, never appears so startlingly distinct as upon\r\nthe occurrence of those extraordinary crises, which, so to speak,\r\nentirely delocalize man, and transport him to a different sphere.\r\nSuch revolutions, it is true, do not unfold themselves in an\r\nabrupt and sudden manner. They are conceived and nurtured in the\r\nwomb of society long before they emerge to the light of day. But\r\nthe moment arrives beyond which their full accomplishment cannot\r\nbe delayed, and they then take possession of all that exists in\r\nsociety, transform it, and place everything in an entirely new\r\nposition; so that if, after such a shock, man looks back upon the\r\nhistory of the past, he can scarcely recognise it. That which he\r\nsees, he had never seen before; what he saw once, no longer\r\nexists as he saw it; facts rise up before him with unknown faces,\r\nand speak to him in a strange language. He sets himself to the\r\nexamination of them under the guidance of other principles of\r\nobservation and appreciation. Whether he considers their causes,\r\ntheir nature, or their consequences, unknown prospects open\r\nbefore him on all sides. The actual spectacle remains the same,\r\nbut it is viewed by another spectator occupying a different\r\nplace;--to his eyes all is changed.\r\n\r\n{3}\r\n\r\nWhat marvel is it, gentlemen, if, in this new state of things and\r\nof himself, man adopts, as the special objects of his study,\r\nquestions and facts which connect themselves more immediately\r\nwith the revolution which has just been accomplished,--if he\r\ndirects his gaze precisely towards that quarter where the change\r\nhas been most profound? The grand crises in the life of humanity\r\nare not all of the same nature; although they, sooner or later,\r\ninfluence the whole mass of society, they act upon it and\r\napproach it, in some respects, from different sides. Sometimes it\r\nis by religious ideas, sometimes by political ideas, sometimes by\r\na simple discovery, or a mechanical invention, that the world is\r\nruled and changed. The apparent metamorphosis which the past then\r\nundergoes is effected chiefly in that which corresponds to the\r\nessential character of the revolution that is actually going\r\nforward in the present. Let us imagine, if we can, the light in\r\nwhich the traditions and religious recollections of Paganism must\r\nhave appeared to the Christians of the first centuries, and then\r\nwe shall understand the new aspects under which old facts present\r\nthemselves in those times of renovation, which Providence has\r\ninvested with a peculiar importance and significance.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Our Historical Position.\r\n\r\nSuch is, gentlemen, up to a certain point, the position in which\r\nwe ourselves are placed with regard to that subject which is to\r\ncome before us in the present course of lectures. It is from the\r\nmidst of the new political order which has commenced in Europe in\r\nour own days that we are about to consider, I do not say\r\nnaturally, but necessarily, the history of the political\r\ninstitutions of Europe from the foundation of modern states. To\r\ndescend from this point of view is not in our power. Against our\r\nwill, and without our knowledge, the ideas which have occupied\r\nthe present will follow us wherever we go in the study of the\r\npast. Vainly should we attempt to escape from the lights which\r\nthey cast thereupon; those lights will only diffuse themselves\r\naround on all sides with more confusion and less utility. We will\r\nthen frankly accept a position which, in my opinion, is\r\nfavourable, and certainly inevitable. We attempt to-day, and with\r\ngood reason, to reconnect what we now are with what we formerly\r\nwere; we feel the necessity of bringing our habits into\r\nassociation with intelligent feeling, to connect our institutions\r\nwith our recollections, and, in fine, to gather together the\r\nlinks in that chain of time, which never allows itself to be\r\nentirely broken, however violent may be the assaults made upon\r\nit.\r\n{4}\r\nIn accordance with the same principles, and guided by the same\r\nspirit, we shall not refuse the aid which can be derived from\r\nmodern ideas and institutions, in order to guide our apprehension\r\nand judgment while studying ancient institutions, since we\r\nneither can, nor would wish to be separated from our proper\r\nselves, any more than we would attempt or desire to isolate\r\nourselves from our forefathers.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Sources of Error.\r\n\r\nThis study, gentlemen, has been much neglected in our days; and\r\nwhen attempts have been made to revive it, it has been approached\r\nwith such a strong preoccupation of mind, or with such a\r\ndetermined purpose, that the fruits of our labour have been\r\ndamaged at the outset. Opinions which are partial and adopted\r\nbefore facts have been fairly examined, not only have the effect\r\nof vitiating the rectitude of judgment, but they moreover\r\nintroduce a deplorable frivolity into researches which we may\r\ncall material. As soon as the prejudiced mind has collected a few\r\ndocuments and proofs in support of its cherished notion, it is\r\ncontented, and concludes its inquiry. On the one hand, it beholds\r\nin facts that which is not really contained in them; on the other\r\nhand, when it believes that the amount of information it already\r\npossesses will suffice, it does not seek further knowledge. Now,\r\nsuch has been the force of circumstances and passions among us,\r\nthat they have disturbed even erudition itself. It has become a\r\nparty weapon, an instrument of attack or defence; and facts\r\nthemselves, inflexible and immutable facts, have been by turns\r\ninvited or repulsed, perverted or mutilated, according to the\r\ninterest or sentiment in favour of which they were summoned to\r\nappear.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this prevailing circumstance of our times, two\r\nopposite tendencies are observable in those opinions and writings\r\nwhich have passed a verdict on the ancient political institutions\r\nof Europe. On the one hand, we see minds so overpowered by the\r\nsplendour of the new day which has dawned upon mankind, that they\r\nsee in the generations which preceded, only darkness, disorder,\r\nand oppression,--objects either for their indignation or their\r\ncontempt. Proud disdain of the past has taken possession of these\r\nminds,--a disdain which exalts itself into a system. This system\r\nhas presented all the characteristics of settled impiety.\r\n{5}\r\nLaws, sentiments, ideas, customs, everything pertaining to our\r\nforefathers, it has treated with coldness or scorn. It would seem\r\nas if reason, regard for justice, love of liberty, all that makes\r\nsociety dignified and secure, were a discovery of to-day, made by\r\nthe generation which has last appeared. In thus renouncing its\r\nancestors, this generation forgets that it will soon join them in\r\nthe tomb, and that in its turn it will leave its inheritance to\r\nits children.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Disdain for the Past.\r\n\r\nThis pride, gentlemen, is not less contrary to the truth of\r\nthings than fatal to the society which entertains it. Providence\r\ndoes not so unequally deal with the generations of men, as to\r\nimpoverish some in order that the rest may be lavishly endowed at\r\ntheir expense. It is doubtless true, that virtue and glory are\r\nnot shared in a uniform degree by different ages; but there is no\r\nage which does not possess some legitimate claim upon the respect\r\nof its descendants. There is not one which has not borne its part\r\nin the grand struggle between good and evil, truth and error,\r\nliberty and oppression. And not only has each age maintained this\r\nlaborious struggle on its own account, but whatever advantage it\r\nhas been able to gain, it has transmitted to its successors. The\r\nsuperior vantage-ground on which we were born, is a gift to us\r\nfrom our forefathers, who died upon the territory themselves had\r\nwon by conquest. It is then a blind and culpable ingratitude\r\nwhich affects to despise the days which are gone. We reap the\r\nfruits of their labours and sacrifices:--is it too much for us to\r\nhallow the memory of those labours, and to render a just\r\nrecompense for those sacrifices?\r\n\r\nIf those men who affect, or who actually feel, this irreverent\r\ndisdain or indifference for ancient times, were better acquainted\r\nwith these times and their history, they would find themselves\r\nconstrained to entertain a different opinion. When, in fact, we\r\ninvestigate the cause of this unnatural state of mind, only one\r\nexplanation can be found. At the moment of grand social reforms,\r\nduring epochs full of ambition and hope, when important changes\r\nare on all sides demanded and necessary, the authority of the\r\npast is the one obstacle which opposes itself to all tendency to\r\ninnovation. The present time seems devoted to errors and abuses,\r\nand the wisdom of centuries is appealed to by one party in order\r\nto resist the future to which the aspirations of the other party\r\nare directed.\r\n{6}\r\nAccordingly, a kind of blind hatred of the past takes possession\r\nof a great number of men. They regard it as making common cause\r\nwith the enemies of present amelioration, and the weapons\r\nemployed by these latter confirm this idea in their mind.\r\nGentlemen, the notion is full of falsehood and misapprehension.\r\nIt is not true that injustice and abuses alone can shelter\r\nthemselves under the authority of antiquity, that they only are\r\ncapable of appealing to precedent and experience. Truth, justice,\r\nand rectitude, are also graced by venerable titles; and at no\r\nperiod has man allowed them to be proscribed. Take in succession\r\nall the moral needs, all the legitimate interests of our society,\r\narrange them in systematic order, and then traverse the history\r\nof our country;--you will find them constantly asserted and\r\ndefended,--all epochs will afford you innumerable proofs of\r\nstruggles endured, of victories won, of concessions obtained in\r\nthis holy cause. It has been carried on with different issues,\r\nbut in no time or place has it been abandoned. There is not a\r\ntruth or a right which cannot bring forward, from any period of\r\nhistory, monuments to consecrate, and facts to vindicate it.\r\nJustice has not retired from the world, even when it finds there\r\nleast support: it has constantly sought and embraced, both with\r\ngovernments and in the midst of peoples, all opportunities for\r\nextending its dominion. It has struggled, protested, waited; and\r\nwhen it has had only glory to bestow upon those who have fought\r\nfor it, it has bestowed that glory with a liberal hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n         True Value of the Past.\r\n\r\nLet us then, gentlemen, reassure ourselves with reference to the\r\nstudy of the past. It contains nothing which ought to alarm the\r\nfriends of all that is good and true. It is into their hands, on\r\nthe contrary, and in subservience to interests which are dear to\r\nthem, that it will ever deposit the authority of antiquity and\r\nthe lessons of experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Undue Veneration of Antiquity.\r\n\r\nThis unjust contempt for ancient institutions, however, this wild\r\nattempt to dissever the present from its connexion with former\r\nages and to begin society afresh, thus delivering it up to all\r\nthe dangers of a position in which it is deprived of its roots\r\nand cast upon the protection of a wisdom which is yet in its\r\ninfancy, is not an error of which we have been the first to give\r\nan example. In one of those ephemeral parliaments which attempted\r\nto maintain its existence under the yoke of Cromwell, it was\r\nseriously proposed to deliver up to the flames all the archives\r\nin the Tower of London, and thus to annihilate the monuments of\r\nthe existence of England in former ages.\r\n{7}\r\nThese infatuated men wished to abolish the past, flattering\r\nthemselves that they would then obtain an absolute control over\r\nthe future. Their design was rejected, and their hope foiled; and\r\nvery soon England, regaining, with new liberties, respect for all\r\nits recollections of the past, entered upon that career of\r\ndevelopment and prosperity which it has continued up to our\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nSide by side with this infatuation which has induced men,\r\notherwise enlightened, to neglect the study of the ancient\r\ninstitutions of Europe, or only to regard their history with a\r\nhasty and supercilious glance, we have seen another infatuation\r\narise, perhaps still more unreasonable and arrogant. Here, as\r\nelsewhere, impiety has been the herald of superstition. The past,\r\nso despised, so neglected by the one party, has become to the\r\nother an object of idolatrous veneration. The former desire that\r\nsociety, mutilating its own being, should disown its former life;\r\nthe latter would have it return to its cradle, in order to remain\r\nthere immovable and powerless. And as those lords of the future\r\nwould in their own wild fancy create out of it, so far as regards\r\ngovernment and social order, the most brilliant Utopias, so\r\nthese, on the other hand, find their Utopia in their dreams of\r\nthe past. The work might appear more difficult; the field open to\r\nthe imagination may seem less open, and facts might be expected\r\nsometimes to press inconveniently against the conclusions sought.\r\nBut what will not a preoccupied mind overcome? Plato and\r\nHarrington, giving to their thoughts the widest range, had\r\nconstructed their ideal of a republic; and we, with still more\r\nconfidence, have constructed our ideal of feudalism, of absolute\r\npower, and even of barbarism. Fully organized societies, adorned\r\nwith freedom and morality, have been conceived and fashioned at\r\nleisure, in order thence to be transported into past ages. After\r\nhaving attempted to resolve, according to principles opposed to\r\nmodern tendencies, the great problem of the harmony between\r\nliberty and power, between order and progress, we have required\r\nthat ancient facts should receive these theories and adapt\r\nthemselves to them.\r\n{8}\r\nAnd since, in the vast number of facts, some are to be found\r\nwhich lend themselves with docility and readiness to the purposes\r\nwhich they are required to serve, the discoverers of this\r\npretended antiquity have not lacked either quotations or proofs\r\nwhich might seem to give it an ascertained and definite existence\r\nin the past. Thus, France, after having spent more than five\r\ncenturies in its struggles to escape from the feudal system, has\r\nall at once discovered that it was wrong in liberating itself\r\nfrom this system, for that in this state it possessed true\r\nhappiness and freedom; and history, which believed itself to be\r\nchargeable with so many evils, iniquities, and convulsions, is\r\nsurprised to learn that it only hands down to us recollections of\r\ntwo or three golden ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Progress, the Law of Nature.\r\n\r\nThere is no necessity for me, gentlemen, to offer any very\r\nserious opposition to this fantastic and superstitious adoration\r\nof the past. It would hardly have merited even a passing\r\nallusion, were it not connected with systems and tendencies in\r\nwhich all society is interested. It is one of the collateral\r\ncircumstances of the grand struggle which has never ceased to\r\nagitate the world. The interests and ideas which have\r\nsuccessively taken possession of society have always wished to\r\nrender it stationary in the position which has given it over to\r\ntheir rule; and when it has escaped from them, it has ever, in so\r\ndoing, had to withstand those seductive images and influences\r\nwhich these interests have called to their aid. There is no fear\r\nthat the world will allow itself to be thus ensnared:--progress\r\nis the law of its nature; hope, and not regret, is the spring of\r\nits movement:--the future alone possesses an attractive virtue.\r\nPeoples who have emerged from slavery have always endeavoured by\r\nlaws to prevent enfranchised man from again falling into\r\nservitude. Providence has not been less careful with regard to\r\nhumanity; and the chains which have not sufficed to confine it,\r\nare still less able to resume the grasp which they have lost. But\r\nthe efforts of a retrograde system have often perverted the study\r\nof ancient times. The Emperor Julian saw in the popular fables of\r\nGreece a philosophy capable of satisfying those moral necessities\r\nwhich Christianity had come to satisfy, and he demanded that men\r\nshould see and honour in the history of decayed paganism that\r\nwhich only existed in his dreams.\r\n{9}\r\nThe same demands have been made with as little reason on behalf\r\nof the ancient political institutions of Europe. Justice, and\r\njustice alone, is due to that which no longer exists, as well as\r\nto that which still remains. Respect for the past means neither\r\napprobation nor silence for that which is false, culpable, or\r\ndangerous. The past deserves no gratitude or consideration from\r\nus, except on account of the truth which it has known, and the\r\ngood which it has aimed at or accomplished. Time has not been\r\nendowed with the unhallowed office of consecrating evil or error;\r\non the contrary, it unmasks and consumes them. To spare them\r\nbecause they are ancient, is not to respect the past, but it is\r\nto outrage truth, which is older than the world itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n         The Duty of Impartiality.\r\n\r\nIf I am not mistaken, gentlemen, we are at this time in an\r\nespecially favourable position for avoiding both of the general\r\nerrors which I have just described. Perhaps few persons think so;\r\nbut impartiality, which is the duty of all times, is, in my\r\nopinion, the mission of ours:--not that cold and unprofitable\r\nimpartiality which is the offspring of indifference, but that\r\nenergetic and fruitful impartiality which is inspired by the\r\nvision and admiration of truth. That equal and universal justice,\r\nwhich is now the deepest want of society, is also the ruling idea\r\nwhich is ever foremost in position and influence, wherever the\r\nspirit of man is found. Blind prejudices, insincere declamation,\r\nare no longer any more acceptable in the world of literature,\r\nthan are iniquity and violence in the world of politics. They may\r\nstill have some power to agitate society, but they are not\r\npermitted either to satisfy or to govern it. The particular state\r\nof our own country strengthens this disposition, or, if you\r\nplease, this general tendency, of the European mind. We have not\r\nlived in that state of repose in which objects appear continually\r\nunder almost the same aspects, in which the present is so\r\nchangeless and regular as to present to man's view an horizon\r\nthat seldom varies, in which old and powerful conventionalisms\r\ngovern thought as well as life, in which opinions are well nigh\r\nhabits, and soon become prejudices;--we have been cast not only\r\ninto new tracks, but these are continually interrupted and\r\ndiversified. All theories, all practices, are displayed in union\r\nor in rivalry before our eyes.\r\n\r\n{10}\r\n\r\nFacts of all kinds have appeared to us under a multitude of\r\naspects. Human nature has been urged impetuously onwards, and\r\nlaid bare, so to speak, in all the elements of which it is\r\nconstituted. Affairs and men have all passed from system to\r\nsystem, from combination to combination; and the observer, while\r\nhimself continually changing his point of view, has been the\r\nwitness of a spectacle which changed as often as he. Such times,\r\ngentlemen, offer but little tranquillity, and prepare tremendous\r\ndifficulties for those which shall follow them. But they\r\ncertainly give to minds capable of sustaining their pressure, an\r\nindependent disposition, and an extended survey, which do not\r\nbelong to more serene and fortunate periods. The large number,\r\nand the unsettled character of the facts which appear before us,\r\nwiden the range of our ideas; the diversity of trials which all\r\nthings undergo within so short an interval, teach us to judge\r\nthem with impartiality; human nature reveals itself in its\r\nsimplicity, as well as in its wealth. Experience hastens to\r\nfulfil its course, and, in some sort, hoards its treasures; in\r\nthe short space of one life, man sees, experiences, and attempts\r\nthat which might have sufficed to fill several centuries. This\r\nadvantage is sufficiently costly, gentlemen, to act at least as\r\nan inducement to our reaping it. It does not become us to\r\nentertain narrow views and obstinate prejudices; to petrify the\r\nform of our judgments by foregone conclusions; in fine, to ignore\r\nthat diffusion of truth, which has been attested by so many\r\nvissicitudes, and which imposes on us the duty of seeking it\r\neverywhere, and rendering it homage wherever we meet it, if we\r\nwould have its sanction to our thoughts, and its aid to our\r\nutterance.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Value of Revolutions.\r\n\r\nIn this spirit, gentlemen, we shall attempt to consider the\r\nancient political institutions of Europe, and to sketch their\r\nhistory. While for this purpose we appropriate such lights as our\r\nage can furnish, we shall endeavour to carry with us none of the\r\npassions which divide it. We shall not approach past times under\r\nthe guidance of such impressions belonging to the present, as\r\nthose whose influence we have just deplored; we shall not address\r\nto them those questions which, by their very nature, dictate the\r\nanswers which they shall receive. I have too much regard for\r\nthose who listen to me, and for the truth after which I, in\r\ncommon with them, am seeking, to suppose that history can in any\r\nsense consent to suppress that which it has asserted, or to utter\r\nwhat is not affirmed by the voice of truth. We must interrogate\r\nit freely, and then leave it to full independence.\r\n\r\n{11}\r\n\r\n         Study of Political Institutions.\r\n\r\nThis study, gentlemen, requires a centre to which it may stand in\r\nrelation,--we must find for so large a number of facts, a bond\r\nwhich may unite and harmonize them. This bond exists in the facts\r\nthemselves--nothing can be less doubtful. Unity and\r\nconsecutiveness are not lacking in the moral world, as they are\r\nnot in the physical. The moral world has, like the system of\r\ncelestial bodies, its laws and activity; only the secret\r\naccording to which it acts is more profound, and the human mind\r\nhas more difficulty in discovering it. We have entered upon this\r\ninquiry so late, that events already accomplished may serve us as\r\nguides. We have no need to ask of some philosophical hypothesis,\r\nitself perhaps uncertain and incomplete, what, in the order of\r\npolitical development, has been the tendency of European\r\ncivilization. A system which evidently, from a general view of\r\nthe subject, adheres continually to the same principles, starts\r\nfrom the same necessities, and tends to the same results,\r\nmanifests or proclaims its presence throughout the whole of\r\nEurope. Almost everywhere the representative form of government\r\nis demanded, allowed, or established. This fact is, assuredly,\r\nneither an accident, nor the symptom of a transient madness. It\r\nhas certainly its roots in the past political career of the\r\nnations, as it has its motives in their present condition. And\r\nif, warned by this, we turn our attention to the past, we shall\r\neverywhere meet with attempts, more or less successful, either\r\nmade with a conscious regard to this system so as to produce it\r\nnaturally, or striving to attain it by the subjugation of\r\ncontrary forces. England, France, Spain, Portugal, Germany and\r\nSweden, supply us with numerous illustrations of this. If we look\r\nto one quarter we shall see these attempts after they have lasted\r\nfor some time, and assumed an historical consistency; in another,\r\nthey have hardly commenced before they issue in failure; in a\r\nthird, they end in a kind of federation of the governments\r\nthemselves. Their forms are as diverse as their fortunes. England\r\nalone continues these struggles without intermission, and enters\r\nat last into full enjoyment of their realization.\r\n\r\n{12}\r\n\r\nBut everywhere they take their place in history, and influence\r\nthe destinies of nations. And when at last, no longer finding\r\neven the shadow of a representative government on the Continent\r\nof Europe, and beholding it only in the parliament of Great\r\nBritain, a man of genius inquires into its origin, he says that\r\n\"this noble system was first found in the woods of Germany,\" from\r\nwhence the ancestors of the whole of Europe have all equally\r\nproceeded.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Origin of Representative Government.\r\n\r\nIn this opinion, as will be afterwards seen, I do not agree with\r\nMontesquieu; but it is evident, both from ancient facts and from\r\nthose which we ourselves have witnessed, that the representative\r\nform of government has, so to speak, constantly hovered over\r\nEurope, ever since the founding of modern states. Its\r\nreappearance at so many times and in so many places, is not to be\r\naccounted for by the charm of any theory, or the power of any\r\nconspiracy. In the endeavour after it, men have often ignored its\r\nprinciples and mistaken its nature, but it has existed in\r\nEuropean society as the basis of all its deepest wants and most\r\nenduring tendencies; sovereigns have invoked its aid in their\r\nhours of difficulty, and nations have ever returned to it during\r\nthose intervals of prosperity and repose in which the march of\r\ncivilization has been accelerated. Its most undeveloped efforts\r\nhave left behind them indelible mementos. Indeed, ever since the\r\nbirth of modern societies, their condition has been such, that in\r\ntheir institution, in their aspirations, and in the course of\r\ntheir history, the representative form of government, while\r\nhardly realized as such by the mind, has constantly loomed more\r\nor less distinctly in the distance, as the port at which they\r\nmust at length arrive, in spite of the storms which scatter them,\r\nand the obstacles which confront and oppose their entrance.\r\n\r\nWe do not then, gentlemen, make an arbitrary choice, but one\r\nperfectly natural and necessary, when we make the representative\r\nform of government the central idea and aim of our history of the\r\npolitical institutions of Europe. To regard them from this point\r\nof view will not only give to our study of them the highest\r\ninterest, but will enable us rightly to enter into the facts\r\nthemselves, and truly to appreciate them. We shall then make this\r\nform of government the principal object of our consideration. We\r\nshall seek it wherever it has been thought to be discernible,\r\nwherever it has attempted to gain for itself a footing, wherever\r\nit has fully established itself.\r\n{13}\r\nWe shall inquire if it has in reality existed at times and in\r\nplaces where we have been accustomed to look for its germs.\r\nWhenever we find any indications of it, however crude and\r\nimperfect they may be, we shall inquire how it has been produced,\r\nwhat has been the extent of its power, and what influences have\r\nstifled it and arrested its progress. Arriving at last at the\r\ncountry where it has never ceased to consolidate and extend\r\nitself, from the thirteenth century to our own times, we shall\r\nremain there in order to follow it in its march, to unravel its\r\nvicissitudes, to watch the development of the principles and\r\ninstitutions with which it is associated, penetrating into their\r\nnature and observing their action,--to study, in a word, the\r\nhistory of the representative system in that country where it\r\nreally possesses a history which identifies itself with that of\r\nthe people and their government.\r\n\r\nBefore undertaking this laborious task, it will be necessary for\r\nme, gentlemen, to exhibit before you, in a few words, the chief\r\nphases of the political condition of Europe, and the series of\r\nthe principal systems of institutions through which it has\r\npassed. This anticipatory classification,--which is but a general\r\nsurvey of facts which will afterwards reappear before you and\r\nbring their own evidence with them,--is necessary, not only in\r\norder to clear the way before us in our study, but also to\r\nindicate the particular institutions and times which the point of\r\nview we have chosen for ourselves especially calls us to\r\nconsider.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Four Epochs in European History.\r\n\r\nThe history of the political institutions of Europe divides\r\nitself into four general epochs, during which society has been\r\ngoverned according to modes and forms essentially distinct.\r\n\r\nThe tribes of Germany, in establishing themselves on the Roman\r\nsoil, carried thither with them their liberty, but none of those\r\ninstitutions by which its exercise is regulated and its\r\npermanence guaranteed. Individuals were free,--a free society,\r\nhowever, was not constituted. I will say further, that a society\r\nwas not then existent. It was only after the conquest, and in\r\nconsequence of their territorial establishment, that a society\r\nreally began to be formed either among the conquerors and the\r\nconquered, or among the victors themselves.\r\n{14}\r\nThe work was long and difficult. The positions in which they were\r\nplaced were complicated and precarious, their forces scattered\r\nand irregular, the human mind little capable of extensive\r\ncombinations and foresight. Different systems of institutions, or\r\nrather different tendencies, appeared and contended with each\r\nother. Individuals, for whom liberty then meant only personal\r\nindependence and isolation, struggled to preserve it. Those who\r\nwere strong succeeded in obtaining it, and became powerful;--\r\nthose who were weak lost it and fell under the yoke of the\r\npowerful. The kings, at first only the chiefs of warrior bands,\r\nand then the first of the great territorial proprietors,\r\nattempted to confirm and extend their power; but simultaneously\r\nwith them an aristocracy was formed, by the local success of\r\nscattered forces and the concentration of properties, which did\r\nnot allow royalty to establish itself with any vigour or to exert\r\nany wide-spread influence. The ancient liberty of the forest, the\r\nearliest attempts at monarchical system, the nascent elements of\r\nthe feudal régime,--such were the powers which were then\r\nstruggling for preeminence in society. No general political order\r\ncould establish itself in the midst of this conflict. It lasted\r\ntill the eleventh century. Then the feudal system had become\r\npredominant. The primitive independence and wild equality of\r\nindividuals had either become merged into a condition of\r\nservitude, or had submitted to the hierarchical subordination of\r\nfeudalism. All central power, whether of kings or of ancient\r\nnational assemblies, had well nigh disappeared; liberty existed\r\nco-ordinately with power; the sovereignty was scattered. This is\r\nthe first epoch. [Footnote 1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: On this see Guizot's History of Civilization in\r\n    France. Lectures vii and viii.]\r\n\r\n\r\n         The Feudal System\r\n\r\nThe second epoch is that of the feudal system. Three essential\r\ncharacteristics belong to it; 1st. The reduction of the mass of\r\nthe people to slavery or a condition bordering thereon: 2nd. The\r\nhierarchical and federative organization of the feudal\r\naristocracy, extending in its application both to persons and\r\nlands: 3rd. The almost entire dissolution of the sovereignty,\r\nwhich then devolved on every feudal proprietor capable of\r\nexercising and defending it; from whence resulted the feebleness\r\nof the royal power and the destruction of monarchical unity,\r\nwhich disappeared almost as completely as national unity. This\r\nsystem prevailed until the thirteenth century.\r\n\r\n{15}\r\n\r\n         Progress Of Monarchical Power.\r\n\r\nThen commenced a new epoch. The feudal lord, already possessed of\r\nroyal power, aspired after royal dignity. A portion of the\r\ninhabitants of the territory, having regained somewhat of the\r\npower they had lost, longed to become free. The feudal\r\naristocracy was attacked on the one hand by the enfranchisement\r\nof the townsmen and tenants, on the other hand by the extension\r\nof the royal power. Sovereignty tended to concentration, liberty\r\nto diffusion;--national unity began to shape itself at the same\r\ntime as monarchical unity appeared. This was at once indicated\r\nand promoted by attempts after a representative form of\r\ngovernment, which were made and renewed during nearly three\r\ncenturies, wherever the feudal system fell into decay, or the\r\nmonarchical system prevailed. But soon sovereigns also began\r\nalmost everywhere to distrust it in their turn. They could not\r\nbehold with indifference that sovereignty, which after having\r\nbeen long diffused had been regained and concentrated by their\r\nefforts, now again divided at its very centre. Besides, the\r\npeople were deficient alike in such strength and knowledge as\r\nwould enable them to continue, on the one hand, against the\r\nfeudal system, a struggle which had not yet ceased, and to\r\nsustain, on the other hand, a new struggle against the central\r\npower. It was evident that the times were not fully matured; that\r\nsociety, which had not thoroughly emerged from that condition of\r\nservitude which had been the successor of social chaos, was\r\nneither so firmly consolidated nor so mentally disciplined as to\r\nbe able to secure at once order by the equitable administration\r\nof power, and liberty by the safeguards of large and influential\r\npublic institutions. The efforts after representative government\r\nbecame more occasional and feeble, and at length disappeared. One\r\ncountry alone guarded and defended it, and advanced from one\r\nstruggle to another, till it succeeded. In other places, the\r\npurely monarchical system prevailed. This result was accomplished\r\nin the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\n{16}\r\n\r\nThe fourth epoch has lasted from that time to our own days. It is\r\nchiefly marked in England by the progress of the representative\r\nsystem; on the Continent, by the development of the purely\r\nmonarchical system, with which are associated local privileges,\r\njudicial institutions which exercise a powerful influence on\r\npolitical order, and some remnants of those assemblies which, in\r\nepochs anterior to the present, appeared under a more general\r\nform, but which now confine themselves to certain provinces, and\r\nare almost exclusively occupied with administrative functions.\r\nUnder this system, though political liberty is no longer met\r\nwith, barbarism and feudalism finally disappear before absolute\r\npower; interior order, the reconciliation of different classes,\r\ncivil justice, public resources and information, make rapid\r\nprogress;--nations become enlightened and prosperous, and their\r\nprosperity, material as well as moral, excites in them juster\r\napprehensions of, and more earnest longings for, that\r\nrepresentative system which they had sought in times when they\r\npossessed neither the knowledge nor the power requisite for its\r\nexercise and preservation.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Subject Of These Lectures.\r\n\r\nThis short epitome of facts has already indicated to you,\r\ngentlemen, the epochs towards which our studies will be\r\nprincipally directed. The objects of our search are the political\r\ninstitutions of various peoples. The representative system is\r\nthat around which our researches will centre. Wherever, then, we\r\ndo not meet with those general institutions, under the empire of\r\nwhich people unite themselves, and which demand the manifestation\r\nof general society in its government,--wherever we perceive no\r\ntrace of the representative system, and no direct effort to\r\nproduce it,--there we shall not linger. All forms and conditions\r\nof society present rich and curious subjects for observation; but\r\nin this inexhaustible series of facts we must choose only those\r\nwhich have a strict relation to one another, and a direct\r\ninterest for us. The second and the fourth epochs therefore, that\r\nis to say, feudalism and absolute power, will occupy us but\r\nlittle. We shall only speak of them so far as a consideration of\r\nthem is necessary to connect and explain the periods which will\r\nmore directly claim our attention. I purpose to study with you\r\nthe first and the third epochs, and the fourth, so far as it\r\nrelates to England.\r\n\r\n{17}\r\n\r\nThe first epoch, which shows us the German people establishing\r\nthemselves on Roman soil--the struggle of their primitive\r\ninstitutions, or rather of their customs and habits, against the\r\nnatural results of their new position,--in fine, the throes\r\nattending the earliest formation of modern nations,--has especial\r\nclaims on our notice. I believe that, so far as regards political\r\ninstitutions, this time possessed nothing which deserves the\r\nname; but all the elements were there, in existence and\r\ncommotion, as in the chaos which precedes creation. It is for us\r\nto watch this process, under which governments and peoples came\r\ninto being. It is for us to ascertain whether, as has been\r\nasserted, public liberty and the representative system were\r\nactually there, whence some symptoms announced that they might\r\none day emerge. When, in the third epoch, we see the feudal\r\nsystem being dissolved,--when we watch the first movements\r\ntowards a representative government appear at the same time with\r\nthe efforts of a central power which aims at becoming general and\r\norganized,--we shall recognize here, without difficulty, a\r\nsubject which immediately belongs to us. We shall seek to learn\r\nwhat societies were then aroused, and by what means they have\r\nsought for trustworthy institutions, which might guarantee the\r\ncontinuance at once of order and of liberty. And when we have\r\nseen their hopes deceived by the calamities of the times, when we\r\nhave detected in the vices of the social state, far more than in\r\nthe influence of any disorderly or perverse desires, the causes\r\nof the ill-success of these magnanimous attempts, we shall be\r\nbrought by our subject into the very midst of that people, then\r\ntreated more leniently by fortune, which has paid dearly for free\r\ninstitutions, but which has guarded them to the last when they\r\nperished everywhere else, and which, while preserving and\r\ndeveloping them for itself, has offered to other nations, if not\r\na model, yet certainly an example.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Limits Of The Inquiry.\r\n\r\nIt would be a small matter for us, gentlemen, thus to limit the\r\nfield of our inquiries so far as epochs are concerned, if we did\r\nnot also assign some boundaries in respect to place. The inquiry\r\nwould be too large and protracted were we to follow the course of\r\npolitical institutions throughout the whole of Europe, according\r\nto the plan I have just indicated. Moreover, the diversity of\r\nevents and conditions has been so great in Europe, that,\r\nnotwithstanding certain general characteristics and certain\r\nphilosophical results which the facts everywhere present, they\r\nvery often resist all the attempts we may make to bring them\r\nunder any uniform guiding principle.\r\n\r\n{18}\r\n\r\nIn vain do we strive to collect them together under the same\r\nhorizon, or to force them into the same channel; ever do they\r\nrelease themselves from our grasp in order to assume elsewhere\r\nthe place assigned to them by truth. We should therefore be\r\ncompelled either to limit ourselves to generalities yielding but\r\nlittle instruction to those who have not sounded all their\r\ndepths, or else continually to interrupt the course of our\r\ninquiry, in order to rove from one people to another with an\r\nattention which would be continually distracted and soon wearied.\r\nIt will be more profitable for us to take a narrower range.\r\nEngland, France, and Spain, will supply us with abundant\r\nmaterials for our undertaking. In these countries we shall study\r\npolitical institutions under the different phases and in the\r\nvarious epochs which I have just exhibited before you. There we\r\nshall find that these epochs are more clearly defined, and that\r\nthe chief facts which characterize them appear under more\r\ncomplete and simple forms. In France and Spain, moreover, the\r\ngeneral attempts after a representative government, made in the\r\nthirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries, assumed a more\r\ndefinite shape. We are therefore dissuaded by a variety of\r\nconsiderations from carrying our steps beyond these limits. Our\r\nresearches will thereby gain both in interest and in solidity.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Interest Of The Subject.\r\n\r\nThis interest, gentlemen, I must say at the outset, is not that\r\nmerely which attaches itself to human affairs, which are ever\r\nattractive to man, however trivial may be the attention which he\r\nbestows upon them. The study of the ancient political\r\ninstitutions of Europe demands serious and assiduous effort. I am\r\nhere to share this with you, not to undertake it for you. I shall\r\nbe frequently obliged to enter into details, which may appear dry\r\nat first, but which are important because of the results to which\r\nthey lead. I shall not content myself with merely presenting\r\nbefore you these results as a general expression of facts; I\r\nshall feel called upon to put you in possession of the facts\r\nthemselves. The truths which they contain must be seen by\r\nyourselves to proceed naturally from them, and must not be\r\nallowed a final lodgment in your minds except as they are\r\nfortified by such evidence as can establish them.\r\n\r\n{19}\r\n\r\n         Difficulty Of Attaining Truth.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, it is to be borne in mind that truth, wheresoever we\r\nmay seek it, is not easy of access. We must dig deep for it, as\r\nfor precious metals, before we find it; we must not shrink from\r\nthe difficulties, nor from the long duration of the enterprise.\r\nIt only surrenders itself to resolute and patient endeavour. And\r\nnot only on behalf of our peculiar study do I urge upon you that\r\nyou should never allow yourselves to be baffled by the fatigue\r\nattendant upon some portions of the work;--a more elevated\r\nmotive, a more comprehensive claim, gives you this advice.\r\nThrasea, when dying, said to his son-in-law, Helvidius Priscus,\r\n\"Observe, young man: thou art living in times when it is well\r\nthat the spirit should become fortified by such a scene as this;\r\nand learn how a brave man can die.\" Thankful should we be to\r\nHeaven that such lessons as these are not now required by us, and\r\nthat the future does not demand such hard discipline in order\r\nthat we may be prepared to meet it. But the free institutions\r\nwhich we are called upon to receive and maintain--these demand of\r\nus, from our earliest youth, those habits of laborious and\r\npatient application which will constitute our fittest\r\npreparation. They require that we should, among our first\r\nlessons, learn not to shrink either from the pain, or from the\r\nlength and arduousness of duty. If our destiny is to be sublime,\r\nour studies must be severe. Liberty is not a treasure which can\r\nbe acquired or defended by those who set a disproportionate value\r\non personal ease and gratification; and if ever man attains it\r\nafter having toiled for it under the influence merely of\r\nluxurious or impatient feelings, it denies to him those honours\r\nand advantages which he expected to gain from its possession. It\r\nwas the error of the preceding age that, while it aimed at urging\r\nthe minds of men into a wider and more active career, it yet\r\nfostered the impression that all was then to become easy, that\r\nstudy would be transformed into amusement, and that obstacles\r\nwere removed from the first steps of a life that was to issue in\r\nsomething great and impressive. The effeminate weakness of such\r\nsentiments were relics of the feebleness of times when liberty\r\ndid not exist. We who live in the present day, know that freedom\r\nrequires from the man who would enjoy it a sterner exercise of\r\nhis powers. We know that it allows neither indolence of soul nor\r\nfickleness of mind, and that those generations which devote their\r\nyouth to laborious study can alone secure liberty for their\r\nmanhood.\r\n\r\n{20}\r\n\r\n         Necessity Of Hard Study.\r\n\r\nYou will find, gentlemen, as you watch the development of the\r\npolitical institutions of Europe, that the experience of all ages\r\nconfirms this of our own. You will not find that those grand\r\ndesigns that have been formed for the promotion of truth,\r\njustice, and progress, have ever emanated from the abode of\r\nsloth, of frivolity, and antipathy to all that demands labour and\r\npatience. As you trace back such enterprises to their source, you\r\nwill always find there, serious aspect and grave determination,\r\nexisting, so to speak, in their early life. Only by men formed in\r\nthis mould have public laws and liberties been defended. They\r\nhave, according as the wants of their age impelled them, resisted\r\ndisorder or oppression. In the gravity of their own life and\r\nthoughts they have found a true measure of their own dignity,\r\nand, in their own, of the dignity of humanity. And, gentlemen, do\r\nnot doubt, in following their example, of achieving also their\r\nsuccess. You will soon become convinced that, in spite of the\r\ntests to which it has been exposed, our age is not among the most\r\nunrestrained that have existed. You will see that patriotism, a\r\nrespect for law and order, a reverence for all that is just and\r\nsacred, have often been purchased at a far heavier price, and\r\nhave called for severer self-denial. You will find that there is\r\nas much feebleness as ingratitude in the disposition that is\r\nintimidated and discouraged by the sight of obstacles which still\r\npresent themselves, when obstacles of a far more formidable\r\ncharacter have not wearied the resolution of noble men of former\r\ntimes. And thus, while early exercising your minds in all those\r\nhabits which will prepare man for the duties of an exalted\r\ndestiny, you will meet with nothing that will not continually\r\ndeepen your attachment to your age and to your country.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Characteristics Of The Present Time.\r\n\r\nSo far as I myself am concerned, may I be allowed, gentlemen, in\r\nentering with you to-day upon the study of the ancient political\r\ninstitutions of Europe, to congratulate myself on being able to\r\napproach the subject with the liberty that is suitable to it. It\r\nwas in works of a similar character that I commenced my\r\nintellectual life. But at that time the public exposition of such\r\nfacts and of the ideas related to them, was hardly permitted.\r\n\r\n{21}\r\n\r\nPower had arrived at that condition in which it fears equally any\r\nrepresentation of the oppression of peoples, and of their efforts\r\nto obtain liberty; as if it must necessarily meet in these two\r\nseries of historical reminiscences at once the condemnation of\r\nits past acts, and the prediction of its future perils. We are no\r\nlonger in this deplorable position; the institutions which France\r\nhas received from its sovereign have liberated at once the\r\npresent and the past. Such is the moral strength possessed by a\r\nlegitimate and constitutional monarchy, that it trembles neither\r\nat the recitals of history nor at the criticisms of reason. It is\r\nbased upon truth,--and truth is consequently neither hostile nor\r\ndangerous to it. Wherever all the wants of society are\r\nrecognised, and all its rights give each other mutual sanction\r\nand support, facts present only lessons of utility, and no longer\r\nhint at unwelcome allusions. The volume of history can now be\r\nspread out before us; and wherever we find the coincidence of\r\nlegitimacy and constitutional order, we shall behold the\r\nprosperity both of governments and of peoples--the dignity of\r\npower ennobled and sustained by the dignity of obedience. In all\r\npositions, and however great may be the interval which separates\r\nthem, we shall see man rendering honour to man; we shall see\r\nauthority and liberty mutually regarding one another with that\r\nconsideration and respect which can alone unite them in lasting\r\nconnexion and guarantee their continued harmony. Let us\r\ncongratulate ourselves, gentlemen, that we are living at a time\r\nin which this tutelary alliance has become a necessity,--in\r\nwhich force without justice could only be an ephemeral power. The\r\ntimes to which we shall direct our attention experienced a harder\r\nlot; they more than once beheld despotism root itself deeply in\r\nits position, and at the same time saw injustice assert its claim\r\nto a lasting rule. We, gentlemen, who have seen so many and\r\ndiversified forms of oppression,--we have seen them all fall into\r\ndecay. Neither their most furious violence, nor their most\r\nimposing lustre, have sufficed to preserve them from the\r\ncorruption that is inherent in their nature; and we have at\r\nlength entered upon an order of things which admits neither the\r\noppression of force which usurps power, nor that of anarchy which\r\ndestroys it.\r\n\r\n{22}\r\n\r\n           Conclusion.\r\n\r\nLet us, gentlemen, reap all the advantages connected with such an\r\norder:--let us show our respect for the distinguished author of\r\nthis Charter by approving ourselves worthy of receiving, and\r\ncapable of employing, the noble institutions which he has\r\nfounded. Our gratitude can offer no purer homage.\r\n\r\n{23}\r\n\r\n\r\n                Lecture II.\r\n\r\n  General character of political institutions in Europe,\r\n  from the fourth to the eleventh century.\r\n\r\n  Political sterility of the Roman Empire.\r\n\r\n  Progress of the Germanic invasions.\r\n\r\n  Sketch of the history of the Anglo-Saxons\r\n\r\n\r\n         Fall Of The Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nI have divided the history of the political institutions of\r\nmodern Europe into four great epochs, the first of which extends\r\nfrom the fourth to the eleventh century. This long interval was\r\nrequired to introduce a little light and fixity into the\r\nchangeful chaos of those new empires which the successive\r\ninvasions of the Roman territory by the barbarians had called\r\ninto being, and whence issued those mighty states whose destiny\r\nconstitutes the history of modern Europe. The essential\r\ncharacteristics of this epoch are: the conflict and fusion of\r\nGermanic customs with Roman institutions, the attempt to\r\nestablish monarchical government, and the formation of the feudal\r\nregime. No general system of political institutions then existed;\r\nno great dominant influence can be discerned; all was local,\r\nindividual, confused, obscure. A multitude of principles and\r\nforces, mingling and acting (as it were) by chance, were engaged\r\nin conflict to resolve a question of which men were completely\r\nignorant, and the secret of which God alone possessed. This\r\nquestion was: What form of government would issue from all these\r\ndifferent elements, brought so violently into contact with each\r\nother. Five centuries elapsed before the question was decided,\r\nand then feudalism was the social state of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Causes Of Its Decay.\r\n\r\nBefore entering, however, upon the history of institutions, let\r\nme say a few words upon the progress of the fall of the Roman\r\nEmpire, and of the invasions of the barbarians.\r\n\r\nFrom the accession of Augustus to the death of Theodosius the\r\nGreat, the Roman Empire, in spite of its greatness, presents a\r\ngeneral character of impotence and sterility. Its institutions,\r\nits government, its philosophy, its literature, indeed everything\r\nconnected with it, bears this sad impress; even the minds of its\r\nmost illustrious citizens were confined to a circle of antiquated\r\nideas, and wasted in vain regrets for the virtues and glories of\r\nthe Republic.\r\n{24}\r\nThe fermentation of new ideas produces no decadence; but when, in\r\na great empire, society, feeling itself oppressed and diseased,\r\ncan conceive no new hopes, no grand ideas,--when, instead of\r\npressing onwards towards the future, it invokes only the\r\nrecollections and images of the past,--then there is a real\r\ndecline; it matters not how long the state is in falling, its\r\nruin is thenceforward continuous and inevitable. The fall of the\r\nRoman Empire occupied fifteen centuries; and for fifteen\r\ncenturies it continued to decline, until its downfall was\r\nconsummated by the capture of Constantinople by the Turks. During\r\nthis long period, no new idea, no regenerative principle, was\r\nemployed to reinvigorate the life of the government; it was\r\nsustained by its own mass. Towards the end of the third century,\r\nwhen the universal servitude seemed to be most firmly\r\nestablished, imperial despotism began to feel the precariousness\r\nof its position, and the necessity for organization. Diocletian\r\ncreated a vast system of administration. Throughout this immense\r\nmachine, he established underworks in harmony with the principle\r\nof his government; he regulated the action of the central power\r\nin the provinces, and surrounded himself with a brilliant and\r\npuissant court: but he did not rekindle the moral life of the\r\nEmpire; he merely organized more perfectly a material resistance\r\nto the principles of destruction which were undermining it; and\r\nit was with this organization that, first in the West as well as\r\nin the East, and afterwards in the East alone, the Empire was\r\nable to struggle on, from the fourth to the fifteenth century.\r\nTheodosius the Great, who died in 395, was the last emperor who\r\ntightly held and skilfully managed the heterogeneous bundle of\r\nthe Roman power. He was truly a great man; for great men appear\r\nin disgraceful times, as well as in times of success; and\r\nTheodosius was still the master of the Roman world. As soon as he\r\nwas dead, the dissolution broke out, under his sons Honorius and\r\nArcadius.[Footnote 2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: Honorius succeeded peaceably to the sovereignty\r\n    of the West, which he had received from his father in the\r\n    preceding year; while his elder brother Arcadius obtained\r\n    possession of the East.]\r\n\r\n{25}\r\n\r\n         Abandonment Of Its Colonies.\r\n\r\nThere was now no real unity or central force in the government;\r\nRome gradually abandoned her provinces--Great Britain, Armorica,\r\n[Footnote 3] and Narbonnese Gaul. [Footnote 4]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 3: The country on the north-west coast of Gaul,\r\n    from the Loire to the Seine.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4: The Roman province in the south of Gaul, so\r\n    called from its chief city, Narbo or Narbonne; Cæsar calls\r\n    it simply _Provincia_, and hence comes the modern name of\r\n    Provence.]\r\n\r\nHonorius informed the Britons that he should govern them no\r\nlonger; and directed the inhabitants of Narbonnese Gaul to elect\r\ndeputies to meet at Arles, and take upon themselves the\r\ngovernment of their country. The Empire had become a body\r\ndestitute of sap and vigour; and in order to prolong the life of\r\nthe trunk, it was necessary to lop off the branches. But,\r\nalthough despotism was withdrawn from these provinces, servitude\r\nremained. It is not easy to return at once to liberty and to\r\npolitical life; and these people, cast upon their own resources,\r\nwere unable to defend themselves. Great Britain, though more\r\npopulous than the north of Scotland, was unable to repel a few\r\nhordes of Picts and Scots, who, every month, descended from their\r\nmountainous abodes, and ravaged the British territory. The\r\nBritons besought the Emperor's assistance, and he sent them a\r\nlegion, which had no difficulty in overcoming enemies who fled\r\nbefore it; but it was soon withdrawn. After its departure, the\r\nincursions recommenced, and Britain again implored the Emperor's\r\naid. Honorius sent another legion; but told the suppliants that\r\nthey must provide for themselves in future, for he would send\r\nthem no more soldiers. The victorious legion left the country to\r\nreturn no more, and Britain, assailed on all sides by bands of\r\nbarbarians, exhausted its energies in vain entreaties for\r\ndeliverance. There still exists a letter, entitled _Gemitus\r\nBritannûm,_ in which the unfortunate inhabitants of that\r\ncountry depict their deplorable condition to Ætius, the Patrician\r\nof Gaul. \"The barbarians,\" they wrote, \"drive us to the sea, and\r\nthe sea drives us back to the barbarians; so that, between the\r\ntwo, we must be either slaughtered or drowned.\" With patriotic\r\nsusceptibility, some English writers--among others Mr. Sharon\r\nTurner, in his _History of the Anglo-Saxons_, [Footnote 5]\r\n--have cast doubts upon the authenticity of this letter, as if\r\nthe honour of England were at all involved in the weaknesses of\r\nthe Britons of the fourth century.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 5: Turner's _History of the Anglo-Saxons_,\r\n    vol. i., pp. 180-181.]\r\n\r\n{26}\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, and whether his aid were besought or not,\r\nthe Emperor had other matters to attend to, and left the Britons\r\nto themselves. He abandoned, in like manner, Narbonnese Gaul and\r\nArmorica. This last province, which was less corrupted by the\r\ninfluence of Roman civilization, displayed greater energy than\r\nthe other two. It took measures for its own defence, by forming a\r\nkind of federative league against maritime invasions. Spain,\r\nwhich was also deserted, endeavoured to maintain itself in the\r\nsame manner against attacks of the same nature; but acted with\r\nlittle vigour, and met with small success. In Great Britain, as\r\nwell as in Gaul, the Roman government had destroyed the energy of\r\ntheir native independence, and had substituted in its stead\r\nnothing but its own artificial and despotic organization. When\r\nthe Romans withdrew, the children of the Gauls, inhabiting Roman\r\ncities, were incapable alike of self-government or self-defence,\r\nand fell an easy prey to a few bands of foreign marauders, who\r\nhad come in search of booty and adventures. Let us briefly glance\r\nat the progress of their conquests.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Invasions Of The Germans.\r\n\r\nNo determinate epoch can be accurately assigned to the first\r\ninvasions of the Germans. In all ages, their hordes were wont to\r\ndescend from their forest-fastnesses into countries less wild and\r\nmore cultivated than their own. Among their early irruptions, the\r\nfirst regarding which we have any precise historical information\r\nis that of the Cimbri and Teutones, who, three hundred thousand\r\nin number, ravaged Italy during the time of Marius. [Footnote 6]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 6: In B.C. 113-101. Marius finally defeated the\r\n    Teutones at Aix, in the year 102; and the Cimbri, near\r\n    Vercelli, in the year 101.]\r\n\r\nFrom the age of Augustus to the fifth century, these invasions\r\ncontinued, but were very unequal in importance. Bands of men,\r\nunable to find means of subsistence in their own country, entered\r\nthe imperial territory, and pillaged as they went; their fate was\r\ndecided by the event of a battle; they were dispersed or\r\nannihilated by a defeat, or, if victorious, they took possession\r\nof some district which pleased them. Frequently, also, they\r\nsettled in the country by the consent of the emperors. In the\r\nthird century, Probus received three or four thousand Franks into\r\nAuvergne.\r\n\r\n{27}\r\n\r\n         Foundation Of Barbarian Kingdoms.\r\n\r\nA band of Alans took up their residence in the neighbourhood of\r\nOrleans; there was a colony of Goths in Thrace, and another of\r\nVandals in Lorraine. Those of the barbarian warriors who\r\npreferred war and pillage to a fixed habitation, entered the\r\nRoman armies. Their chieftains became generals, and even supplied\r\nthe imperial court with ministers of state. Thus the barbarians\r\nwere everywhere settled in the country, serving in the armies,\r\nsurrounding the person of the prince; formidable allies, whose\r\nassistance the weakness of the empire was forced to accept, and\r\nwho were destined to increase in power and influence in\r\nproportion as the imperial power decayed.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Roman government, by abandoning several of its\r\nprovinces, proclaimed its inability to maintain its own\r\nintegrity, the question was decided,--the empire passed to the\r\nGermans. During the interval which elapsed between the beginning\r\nof the fifth and the end of the sixth century, they founded eight\r\ngreat monarchies, some of which were established by force, whilst\r\nothers received the partial assent of the emperors.\r\n\r\nIn 409, the Vandals, Alans, and Suevi, after having ravaged Gaul,\r\nand crossed the Pyrenees, founded by armed force, in Spain, three\r\nmonarchies, which were speedily incorporated into one; and this\r\none, in its turn, was, ere long, destroyed by the Visigoths.\r\n\r\nIn 429, the Vandals passed from Spain into Africa, and founded a\r\nmonarchy, which was overthrown by Belisarius.\r\n\r\nIn 414, the Burgundians founded a kingdom in Gaul, with the\r\nconsent of the emperors.\r\n\r\nIn 416, the Visigoths penetrated into Southern Gaul, where they\r\nfounded the kingdom of Aquitaine; and entered by the north-east\r\ninto Spain, where they settled, after having destroyed the\r\nmonarchy of the Suevi.\r\n\r\nIn 450, the Saxons, led by Hengist and Horsa, invaded Great\r\nBritain, and founded the Saxon Heptarchy.\r\n\r\nIn 476, the Heruli, under the command of Odoacer, founded a\r\nmonarchy in Italy.\r\n\r\nIn 481, the Franks, with Clovis at their head, established\r\nthemselves in Gaul.\r\n\r\nIn 568, the Lombards, under the command of Alboin, conquered\r\nItaly in their turn, and founded a monarchy.\r\n\r\n{28}\r\n\r\n         Power Of The Emperors.\r\n\r\nI do not propose to write the history of these monarchies; but I\r\nshall endeavour to delineate their leading institutions and their\r\nsocial condition. In the first place, however, I shall say a few\r\nwords on the method of their foundation. We must not suppose that\r\nthere was, in every instance, a cession or complete abandonment\r\nof sovereignty by the Roman empire. The residence of a barbarian\r\nchieftain in the country was recognised as a fact. He continued\r\nto command his own warriors, but no legal authority was granted\r\nhim over the old inhabitants. The cities long maintained their\r\nconnexion with Rome; several of them remained municipalities, and\r\ncontinued to appoint their own magistrates. Several towns in\r\nSpain, while the country was under the dominion of the Visigoths,\r\nreceived their civic rulers from Constantinople. The emperors,\r\nthough daily despoiled of some new territory, nevertheless\r\nretained, in almost every quarter, an appearance of empire. Thus\r\nwe find them conferring on the Frankish kings the titles of\r\nPatrician of Gaul, and of Consul. This was their protest against\r\nthe invasion. In scarcely any case was there a transference of\r\nsovereign rights. Societies, when abandoned by their government,\r\neither received a new one at the hands of the victor, or\r\nendeavoured to create one for themselves.\r\n\r\n            The Anglo-Saxons.\r\n\r\nAmong these rising states, I shall first refer to the\r\nAnglo-Saxons; then I shall pass on to the Franks; and, finally,\r\nto the Visigoths in Spain. I have selected these three nations,\r\nbecause, among them, the institutions of this period are most\r\ndistinctly marked. The Anglo-Saxons, especially, were placed in a\r\nposition most favourable for this rapid and complete development.\r\nNot only were they more isolated than other peoples; they were\r\nalso less disturbed by continual invasions of a formidable\r\ncharacter. They soon became sole masters of the country. The\r\nBritons were almost exterminated; some of them retired into\r\nCornwall, Wales, and Armorica; the others were dispersed, or\r\nreduced to servitude. The Anglo-Saxons, moreover, were less under\r\nthe influence of the old Roman institutions. Among modern\r\nnations, they are the people who, so to speak, have lived most\r\nupon their own resources, and given birth to their own\r\ncivilization. This character is discernible in their whole\r\nhistory, and even in their literature.\r\n{29}\r\nThe Greek and Latin classics have produced but little effect upon\r\nthem; primitive and national customs have maintained their sway\r\nin England, and received an almost unmixed development. Among the\r\nFranks and Visigoths, the old Germanic national assemblies were\r\neither suspended for a long period, or entirely transformed;\r\namong the Anglo-Saxons, they never ceased; year after year, they\r\noccurred to perpetuate ancient recollections, and to exert a\r\ndirect influence upon the government. It was, then, among the\r\nAnglo-Saxons, that, from the fifth to the eleventh century,\r\ninstitutions received the most natural and complete development.\r\nThis fact has induced me to commence our studies with their\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nLet me briefly refer to the events which occurred during the\r\nperiod of the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy. From 426 to 450, the\r\nBritons, left to themselves, struggled as they could against the\r\ninhabitants of the north of Scotland. In 449, some Saxons from\r\nthe banks of the Elbe disembarked upon the island. This descent\r\nwas neither novel nor unforeseen. It was a fact so ancient, that\r\nthe Roman emperors had appointed a magistrate--_comes littoris\r\nSaxonici_--whose special duty it was to provide for the\r\ndefence of the coast. It is affirmed, and Hume has repeated the\r\nstatement, that this Saxon expedition had been summoned by\r\nVortigern, who was then chief of the Britons, to assist him\r\nagainst the Picts and Scots. This appears to me neither natural\r\nnor probable; and I find in the chronicler Nennius, a passage\r\nwhich completely disproves the assertion: \"Meanwhile,\" he says,\r\n\"there arrived from Germany three vessels full of Saxon exiles.\"\r\n[Footnote 7] They came therefore spontaneously, according to\r\ntheir custom. The Britons, reduced to extremities by their\r\nuntiring enemies, the Picts and Scots, endeavoured at first to\r\nuse the Saxons against them. But the new-comers quickly\r\ndiscovered their strength, attempted the conquest of the country\r\nwhich they had promised to defend, and succeeded in their\r\nattempt. The Britons resisted, and even displayed somewhat of the\r\nenergy of their ancestors, under King Arthur and other leaders. A\r\nlong time elapsed before they were finally subjugated or\r\nexpelled. During the period from 455 to 582, the Saxons founded\r\nthe seven or eight kingdoms which, composed the Heptarchy, or the\r\nOctarchy, as Mr. Sharon Turner maintains. [Footnote 8]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 7: Nennius, cap. 31.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 8: _History of the Anglo-Saxons_, vol. i. p.\r\n    320.]\r\n\r\n{30}\r\n\r\nThe kingdom of Kent was the first, founded by Hengist. The others\r\nwere the kingdoms of Sussex, Wessex, Essex, Northumberland (or\r\nBernicia and Deira), East Anglia, and Mercia. This division\r\ncontinued until the year 800. At that time, Egbert, King of\r\nWessex, attempted to subjugate the other kingdoms, and succeeded\r\nin reducing five under his sway; but Northumberland and Mercia\r\ncontinued separate, though subordinate kingdoms, until the end of\r\nthe ninth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n         _Reign Of King Alfred._\r\n\r\nIt was at this period that the Danes and Normans made their way\r\ninto England: they long contested the possession of the country\r\nwith the Saxons; and, at the accession of Alfred, the last\r\nnew-comers held sway almost all over the land. You are all\r\nacquainted with the history of this monarch, the greatest of the\r\nkings of England. In the marshes where he had been compelled to\r\nseek refuge from the pursuit of his enemies, he formed his plans\r\nfor the deliverance of his country. Disguised as a harper, he\r\nentered the Danish camp for the purpose of learning the amount of\r\ntheir forces; and finally reconquered his kingdom, after a\r\nprotracted struggle. Restored thus to his throne, Alfred laid the\r\nfoundation of English institutions, or rather, he reduced them to\r\norder, and gave them authority. It is the custom, however, to\r\ndate their origin from him; and his reign is an era in English\r\nlegislation. Alfred is a glorious instance of a truth exemplified\r\nby Gustavus Vasa and Henry IV. of France in later times, namely,\r\nthat the greatest princes are those who, though born to the\r\nthrone, are nevertheless obliged to conquer its possession. To\r\ntheir acknowledged right they thus join ample proof of their\r\nmerit. They have lived as common individuals in the midst of\r\ntheir people; and have thus become better men and better kings.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Alfred, the Danes, whose conquests had been\r\nsuspended only by the victories of that prince, gained possession\r\nof England. Canute the Great took possession of the throne; but\r\nhe reigned with moderation, and did not change the laws of the\r\ncountry. This wisdom on the part of the conqueror mitigated the\r\nanimosity of the vanquished; and the Danes and Saxons agreed so\r\nwell together, that, not long after the death of Canute the\r\nGreat, the old dynasty re-ascended the throne.\r\n{31}\r\nEdward the Confessor collected together the old Saxon laws; on\r\nthis account, he is still respected in England as a national\r\nlegislator. But the collection of laws which now exists under his\r\nname was not made by him; that which he composed has\r\nunfortunately been lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n           _The Norman Conquest._\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Edward the Confessor, a striking\r\nexemplification was given of the power of some of the nobles, who\r\nwere in fact, if not in right, rivals of their monarch. Earl\r\nGodwin was so powerful that he, so to speak, allowed Edward to\r\nascend the throne, on condition that he should marry his\r\ndaughter. At his death, his son Harold succeeded him, and\r\nincreased his authority. Harold's influence extended all over the\r\nkingdom, and he only awaited the king's death to take possession\r\nof the crown. When Edward died, Harold naturally succeeded to\r\nthrone. No one in England contested his usurpation. But William\r\nthe Bastard, Duke of Normandy, one of his distant relations,\r\nalleged that Edward had bequeathed the crown to him by will. He\r\ncrossed the sea to maintain his pretended rights, and, on the\r\n14th of October, 1066, he gave battle to Harold, at Hastings.\r\nHarold was left dead on the field. William the Conqueror\r\nintroduced into England the feudal institutions which were then\r\nin full vigour in Normandy. The reciprocal relations of persons\r\nmight have conduced, in England, to the establishment of this\r\nsystem, and had prepared the way for it; but the legal and\r\nhierarchical subordination of land had not yet taken firm hold in\r\nthat country. The conquest of William of Normandy disturbed the\r\nnatural course of the old Anglo-Saxon institutions, and mingled\r\ntherewith foreign elements which had already been developed,\r\namong the Normans, by their position in Gaul, in the midst of\r\nRoman cities, and a Roman population. We shall presently see what\r\ndecisive influence this circumstance exerted over the political\r\ndevelopment of England.\r\n\r\n{32}\r\n\r\n               Lecture III.\r\n\r\n  Subject of the lecture.\r\n\r\n  A knowledge of the state of persons necessary\r\n  to the proper study of institutions.\r\n\r\n  Essential difference between antiquity and modern societies,\r\n  as regards the classification of social conditions.\r\n\r\n  State of persons among the Anglo-Saxons.\r\n\r\n  Thanes and Ceorls.\r\n\r\n  Central and local institutions.\r\n\r\n  Predominance of the latter among the Anglo-Saxons.\r\n\r\n  Its cause\r\n\r\n\r\n         Anglo-Saxon Institutions.\r\n\r\nIn my preceding lecture, I gave a general outline of the decay of\r\nthe Roman empire, and of the progress of the barbarian invasions;\r\nand I enumerated the principal events in the history of the\r\nAnglo-Saxons in England. I now come to their institutions, which\r\nform the subject of my present lecture.\r\n\r\nWhen we are about to speak of the institutions of a country at\r\nany given period, we must first understand what was the state of\r\npersons in that country at that period; for words are very\r\ndeceptive. History, when speaking of the English nation or the\r\nSpanish nation, comprises under that name all the individuals who\r\ninhabit the country; but when we examine into the real state of\r\nthe case, we quickly discover that the facts which history\r\napplies to an entire country, actually belong only to a very\r\nsmall section of its inhabitants. It is the work of civilization\r\nto raise up, from time to time, a greater number of men to take\r\nan active part in the great events which agitate the society of\r\nwhich they are members. As civilization advances, it reaches new\r\nclasses of individuals, and gives them a place in history. The\r\ndifferent conditions of society thus tend, not to confusion, but\r\nto arrangement, under different forms and in different degrees,\r\nin that superior region of society by which history is made.\r\n\r\nThe first question to be solved, then, is that of the state of\r\npersons; we must precisely understand which are those classes\r\nthat really figure in history. Then will occur this other\r\nquestion: What are the institutions in accordance with which that\r\npolitical nation acts, which alone furnishes subject-matter for\r\nhistory?\r\n\r\n{33}\r\n\r\nWhen we address the first question to antiquity, we find, as in\r\nModern Europe, one great classification: freemen and slaves. But\r\nthere is this difference that, in antiquity, slavery continued\r\nstationary and immutable. Its unchangeableness in this\r\nparticular, was one of the principal characteristics of ancient\r\ncivilization. Individuals were emancipated; but the great mass of\r\nslaves remained in bondage, everlastingly condemned to the same\r\nsocial nonentity. In Modern Europe, social conditions have been\r\nin a state of perpetual fluctuation; numerous masses of men have\r\nfallen into slavery, while others have emerged therefrom; and\r\nthis alternation of liberty and servitude is a novel and\r\nimportant fact in the history of civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Thanes And Ceorls.\r\n\r\nWhat was the condition of persons among the Anglo-Saxons? Here,\r\nas elsewhere, we at first perceive the two great divisions of\r\nfreemen and slaves. The freemen, who are the only active elements\r\nin history, were divided into two classes, _thanes_ and\r\n_ceorls_. The thanes were the proprietors of the soil, which\r\nwas entirely at their disposal: hence the origin of freehold\r\ntenure. The ceorls were men personally free, but possessing no\r\nlanded property. The thanes were subdivided into two classes;\r\nking's thanes, and inferior thanes. This distinction is not\r\nmerely a historical fact; the laws recognize these two divisions.\r\nThe composition for the life of a king's thane was twelve hundred\r\nshillings, while for that of an inferior thane it was only six\r\nhundred. Here, as in other states which came into existence at\r\nthis epoch, punishment was made proportionate, not only to the\r\ngravity of the offence, but also to the rank of the person\r\ninjured. By the substitution of an indemnity for retaliation, a\r\nstep was taken by these peoples towards social justice. Early\r\nideas of justice inflict evil for evil, injury for injury; but\r\nthe highest point of its perfection is that decision of society\r\nwhich, embodying supreme reason and power, judges the actions of\r\nmen accused of crimes, and acquits or condemns them in the name\r\nof the Eternal Justice. In the sixth century, society did not\r\ninflict punishment; life, like everything else, had its price;\r\nand this price was shared between the family of the dead man, the\r\nking, and the judge.\r\n{34}\r\nThe penalty of crime was as yet only the price paid for the\r\nrenunciation of the right of revenge which belonged to every free\r\nman. Individuals who were injured, either in the possession of\r\ntheir goods, or in the life of their relatives, received a fixed\r\ncomposition from the guilty person.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Different Classes Of Thanes.\r\n\r\nI have pointed out the legal distinction which subsisted between\r\nthe king's thanes and the inferior thanes; but when we seek to\r\ndiscover what constituted the real difference of their condition,\r\nwe find that this difference was very vague, and belonged to the\r\ntime when they all led a nomadic life, rather than to their\r\nsettled agricultural existence. In Germany, or on leaving\r\nGermany, bands, more or less numerous, united themselves to the\r\ncompany of some particular chief or king. After the conquest of a\r\ncountry, those chiefs who were nearest the king found themselves\r\nin a most favourable position for becoming large landed\r\nproprietors. These were called king's thanes, because they\r\nbelonged to the royal band. But there was nothing to separate\r\nthem essentially from the other thanes. To be a king's thane, it\r\nwas necessary to possess about forty or fifty hides of land.\r\n[Footnote 9]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 9: A hide of land was about 120 acres.]\r\n\r\nBishops and abbots were admitted into this class. The inferior\r\nthanes were proprietors possessing less land, but able to dispose\r\njust as freely of their property as the king's thanes. Some\r\nwriters have asserted that the king's thanes were the nobles, and\r\nthat the others were simple freemen. An attentive examination of\r\nAnglo-Saxon institutions will prove that there was no such\r\ndifference of position and rights between the two classes. It is\r\na great error to expect to meet with clearly defined ranks and\r\nconditions, at the origin of society. Some writers, however,\r\npretend to discover at the outset what time alone can introduce.\r\nWe meet with no nobility, constituting a superior social\r\ncondition, with recognized privileges: we perceive only the\r\ncauses which will progressively form a nobility, that is, will\r\nintroduce inequality of power and the empire of the strong. The\r\nformation of a class of nobles has been the work of ages. An\r\nactual superiority, transmitted from father to son, has gradually\r\nassumed the form and characteristics of a right. When societies\r\nhave not been long in existence, we do not find in them social\r\nconditions thus distinctly marked, and the royal family is the\r\nonly one that can, with any reason, be termed noble.\r\n{35}\r\nIt generally derives its title from some religious filiation; for\r\ninstance, among nearly all the peoples of the north, in Denmark,\r\nin Norway, and in England, the kings descended from Odin; and\r\ntheir divine origin gave high sanction to their power.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Their Mutual Relations.\r\n\r\nOther writers have held that the relations which subsisted\r\nbetween the king's thanes and the inferior thanes were of a\r\ndifferent nature, corresponding to the feudal relations of lords\r\nand vassals. The king's thanes, they say, were vassals of the\r\nking; the inferior thanes were vassals of the king's vassals. We\r\nmay certainly discover, in the connection of these two classes of\r\nmen, some of the characteristics of feudalism. But feudalism,\r\nsuch as was established on the Continent as well as in England,\r\nafter the conquest by William of Normandy, consisted essentially\r\nin the simultaneous hierarchy of lands and persons. Such were not\r\nthe rudiments of feudalism discernible among the Anglo-Saxons. As\r\nyet, the only hierarchy existing among them was of persons. All\r\nthe thanes held their lands in an equally free and independent\r\nmanner. At a later period, feudalism received a more complete\r\ndevelopment; from the hierarchy of persons proceeded that of\r\nlands, and the latter soon predominated over the former. But this\r\nresult was not manifested until after the Norman conquest. Before\r\nthat period, there were no vassals properly so called, although\r\nthe word _vassus_ occurs in a biography of King Alfred. The\r\ncauses which led to the subordination of persons, independently\r\nof their connection with land, are simple and may easily be\r\nconceived. When the barbarian chieftains entered the Roman\r\nterritory, they possessed an influence over their companions\r\nwhich they endeavoured to retain after their settlement. The\r\nSaxon laws, with a view to bring this rude and floating state of\r\nsociety into an orderly state, provided for the maintenance of\r\nthis primitive hierarchy; and compelled every freeman who had\r\nattained the age of twelve years, to enrol himself in some\r\ncorporation of individuals, in a tithing or a hundred, or else to\r\nplace himself under the patronage of a chieftain. This bond was\r\nso strong that the person who made the engagement could not\r\nabsent himself without the permission of the captain of his\r\ncorporation, or of his chieftain.\r\n{36}\r\nA foreigner even might not remain forty days on the English soil\r\nwithout enrolling himself in this manner. This spirit of\r\nsubordination, this obligation of discipline, is one of the\r\nprincipal characteristics of Anglo-Saxon legislation. All those\r\nkings who, after long-continued disorders, were desirous to\r\nreorganise society, exerted themselves to restore to vigorous\r\noperation these laws of police and classification. They have been\r\nattributed to Alfred, but he merely re-enacted them.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, then, there is no legitimate ground for the\r\ndoctrine that the relation of the king's thanes to the inferior\r\nthanes, was a feudal relation. It was the natural relationship\r\nwhich necessarily arose, at the origin of society, between the\r\nvarious degrees of power and wealth. The poor and the weak lived\r\nunder the surveillance and protection of those who were richer\r\nand more powerful.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Freedom Of The Ceorls.\r\n\r\nAs I have already observed, the freemen were divided into two\r\nclasses,--thanes and ceorls. I shall now speak of the second\r\nclass. The ceorls were freemen who lived on the estates of the\r\nthanes, and cultivated them. Their free condition has been called\r\nin question, wrongly, as I think, for various reasons:\r\n\r\n  1st. The composition for the life of a ceorl was two hundred\r\n  shillings, and the characteristic mark of his liberty is that a\r\n  portion of this composition was paid to his family, and not to\r\n  the proprietor of the estate on which he lived; whereas, the\r\n  composition for the life of a slave was always paid to his\r\n  owner.\r\n\r\n  2nd. In the early times of the Saxon monarchy, the ceorls were\r\n  able to leave the land which they cultivated, whenever they\r\n  pleased; by degrees, however, they lost this liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Ceorls and Slaves.\r\n\r\n  3rd. They had the right of bearing arms, and might go to war;\r\n  whereas, slaves did not possess this right. When Earl Godwin\r\n  attacked King Edward, he armed all the ceorls on his estates;\r\n  and, at the time of the Danish invasions, the ceorls fought in\r\n  defence of their country.\r\n\r\n  4th. They were also capable of possessing property, and when\r\n  they owned five hides of land they passed into the class of\r\n  thanes, as did also merchants who had made three voyages to\r\n  foreign lands. Hence the origin of the English yeomanry. The\r\n  yeoman is the freeholder, who, possessing an income of forty\r\n  shillings from land, votes at county elections, and may sit on\r\n  juries; _probus et legalis homo_.\r\n\r\n{37}\r\n\r\n  5th. The ceorls were admitted to give evidence, only, it is\r\n  true, in matters which had reference to persons of their own\r\n  class: whereas slaves did not possess this right.\r\n\r\n  6th. Nearly all the ceorls were Saxons: we find in a canon of\r\n  the clergy of Northumberland, that a ceorl accused of a crime,\r\n  must bring forward as witnesses twelve ceorls and twelve\r\n  Britons.\r\n\r\nThe ceorls, then, were Saxons, and were distinguished from the\r\nancient inhabitants of the country. It is impossible that so\r\nlarge a proportion of the conquerors should have fallen so\r\nquickly into servitude. We may rather feel astonished that they\r\nhad no landed property in the country, which they had just\r\nconquered. But Tacitus, with the accustomed truthfulness and\r\nvigour of his pencil, makes us readily understand this\r\ncircumstance. In the forests of Germany, the barbarian warriors\r\nalways lived around their chieftains, who had to suggest and\r\ncommand expeditions in times of activity, and to lodge and\r\nsupport their men in times of repose. The same habits were kept\r\nup after the conquest of a country; the property acquired was not\r\ndivided among all the victors. Every chieftain received a larger\r\nor smaller division of land, and his followers settled with him\r\nupon it. These men, accustomed to a wandering life, did not yet\r\nset a high value upon landed property. Being still harassed,\r\nmoreover, by the ancient possessors of the soil, they found it\r\nnecessary to keep together, and unite in their own defence. They\r\nformed species of camps around the dwelling of their chieftain,\r\nwhose possessions, according to the ancient Saxon laws, were\r\ndivided into two parts--_inlands_ and _outlands_. And\r\nit is clear proof of the great difference then existing between\r\nthe ceorls and the slaves, that the latter alone cultivated the\r\nland adjoining the habitation of the chief, while the ceorls, as\r\na natural consequence of their personal freedom, tilled the\r\noutlands. This state of things, however, could not last long. A\r\nlarge number of the ceorls fell into servitude, and assumed the\r\nname of _villeins_ (villani); while others acquired lands\r\nfor themselves, and became the _soc-men_ of England.\r\n\r\n{38}\r\n\r\nSumming up what we have said, we perceive, in the state of\r\npersons under the Anglo-Saxon monarchy, one great division into\r\nfreemen and slaves: and, among the freemen, another distinction\r\nof thanes and ceorls. The thanes themselves are subdivided into\r\nking's thanes and inferior thanes. The former are large landed\r\nproprietors, the latter hold smaller estates; but both classes\r\npossess equal rights. The ceorls are freemen, without landed\r\nproperty, at least originally. Most of them fall into a state of\r\nservitude. With regard to the slaves, we can say nothing except\r\nthat they were very numerous, and were divided into domestic\r\nservants and rural serfs, or serfs of the glebe. The ancient\r\ninhabitants of the country did not all fall into servitude; some\r\nof them retained their possessions, and a law of King Ina\r\nauthorized them to appear before courts of justice. They might\r\neven pass into the class of thanes if they possessed five hides\r\nof land.\r\n\r\nThe thanes alone, to speak truly, played an active part in\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n\r\n         _Local Institutions._\r\n\r\nPassing now to the institutions which connected and governed\r\nthese different classes, we find them to be of two kinds; central\r\ninstitutions, entirely in the hands of the thanes, the object of\r\nwhich was to secure the intervention of the nation in its own\r\ngovernment; and local institutions, which regulated those local\r\ninterests and guarantees which applied equally to all classes of\r\nthe community.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Origin Of Centralization.\r\n\r\nAt the origin of Anglo-Saxon society, there existed none but\r\nlocal institutions. In these are contained the most important\r\nguarantees for men whose life never goes beyond the boundaries of\r\ntheir fields. At such epochs, men are as yet unacquainted with\r\ngreat social life; and as the scope of institutions always\r\ncorresponds to the scope of the affairs and relations to which\r\nthey have reference, it follows that when relations are limited,\r\ninstitutions are equally so. They continue local, because all\r\ninterests are local; there are very few, if any, general taxes\r\nand affairs of public concern; the kings live, like their\r\nsubjects, on the income derived from their estates. The\r\nproprietors care little about what is passing at a distance. The\r\nidea of those great public agencies which regulate the affairs of\r\nall men, does not belong to the origin of societies. By degrees,\r\nin the midst of the chaos of the rising society, small\r\naggregations are formed which feel the want of alliance and union\r\nwith each other. They establish amongst themselves an\r\nadministration of justice, a public militia, a system of taxation\r\nand police.\r\n{39}\r\nSoon, inequality of strength is displayed among neighbouring\r\naggregations. The strong tend to subjugate the weak, and usurp,\r\nat first, the rights of taxation and military service. Thus,\r\npolitical authority leaves the aggregations which first\r\ninstituted it, to take a wider range. This system of\r\ncentralization is not always imposed by force: it sometimes has a\r\nmore legitimate cause. In times of difficulty, a superior man\r\nappears who makes his influence first felt in the society to\r\nwhich he belongs. When attacked, the society intrusts him with\r\nits defence. Neighbouring societies follow this example; soon the\r\npowers granted in time of war are continued in time of peace, and\r\nremain concentrated in a single hand. This victorious power\r\nretains the right to levy men and money. These are the rights of\r\nwhich the movement of centralization first deprives small local\r\nsocieties; they retain for a longer period the rights of\r\nadministering justice, and establishing police regulations; they\r\nmay even retain them for a very long while, and England offers us\r\nmany such examples.\r\n\r\nThe preponderance of local institutions belongs to the infancy of\r\nsocieties. Civilization incessantly tends to carry power still\r\nhigher; for power, when exercised from a greater distance, is\r\ngenerally more disinterested, and more capable of taking justice\r\nand reason for its sole guides. But frequently also, as it\r\nascends, power forgets its origin and final destiny; it forgets\r\nthat it was founded to maintain all rights, to respect all\r\nliberties; and meeting with no further obstacles from the energy\r\nof local liberties, it becomes transformed into despotism. This\r\nresult is not, however, necessary and fatal; society, while\r\nlabouring for the centralization of authority, may retain, or\r\nregain at a later period, certain principles of liberty. When\r\ncentral institutions have obtained too absolute a prevalence,\r\nsociety begins to perceive the defects inherent in an edifice\r\nwhich is detached, as it were, from the soil on which it stands.\r\nSociety then constructs upon itself the exact opposite of what it\r\nbuilt before; looks narrowly into the private and local interests\r\nof which it is composed; duly appreciates their necessities and\r\nrights; and, sending back to the different localities the\r\nauthorities which had been withdrawn therefrom, makes an\r\nappropriate distribution of power.\r\n\r\n{40}\r\n\r\n         _Effects Of The French Revolution._\r\n\r\nWhen we study the institutions of France, we shall be presented\r\nwith the greatest and clearest example of this double history. We\r\nshall perceive the great French society formed from a multitude\r\nof little aggregations, and tending incessantly to the\r\nconcentration of the different powers contained within it. One\r\ngreat revolution almost entirely destroyed every vestige of our\r\nancient local institutions, and led to the centralization of all\r\npower. We now suffer from the excesses of this system; and having\r\nreturned to just sentiments of practical liberty, we are desirous\r\nto restore to localities the life of which they have been\r\ndeprived, and to resuscitate local institutions, with the\r\nconcurrence and by the action of the central power itself. Great\r\noscillations like these constitute the social life of humanity,\r\nand the history of civilization.\r\n\r\n{41}\r\n\r\n                     Lecture IV.\r\n\r\n  Local institutions among the Anglo-Saxons.\r\n\r\n  Divisions of territory; their origin and double object.\r\n\r\n  Internal police of these local associations.\r\n\r\n  Importance of the county-courts; their composition\r\n  and attributes.\r\n\r\n  Complex origin of the Jury.\r\n\r\n  Central institutions of the Anglo-Saxons.\r\n\r\n  The Wittenagemot; its composition, and the\r\n  principle on which it was based.\r\n\r\n  Increasing preponderance of the large landowners\r\n  in the Anglo-Saxon monarchy.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Local Institutions In England.\r\n\r\nIn my preceding lecture I pointed out the causes of the special\r\nimportance of local institutions, at that epoch in the\r\ndevelopment of civilization which now occupies our attention. I\r\nnow proceed to examine into those institutions.\r\n\r\nThey were of two kinds. One class bound man to a superior,\r\nestablished a certain right of man over man, a personal\r\npre-eminence and subordination, which were the source of mutual\r\nduties. On the Continent, this hierarchy of persons became the\r\nfirst principle of feudalism, which would perhaps have received\r\nonly a very imperfect development in England, had not William the\r\nConqueror transplanted it to that country in its complete state.\r\nThe other class of local institutions bound men of equal rank to\r\neach other, regulated their mutual relations, and defined their\r\nreciprocal rights and duties. The first class marked a\r\nrelationship of protection and dependence; the second summoned\r\nall the inhabitants of the same territory, possessing the same\r\nrights and the same obligations, to deliberate in common upon\r\naffairs of common interest. These were the predominant\r\ninstitutions of the Anglo-Saxons. Norman feudalism could not\r\nentirely abolish them.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Divisions Of The Soil.\r\n\r\nAt this period, England was divided into tithings, hundreds, and\r\ncounties. This division has been attributed to King Alfred: he\r\nseems to be the founder of all the legislation of this epoch,\r\nbecause it all issues in a fixed and precise form from his reign;\r\nbut he found it already in existence, and did nothing more than\r\narrange it in a written code. He did not, then, originate this\r\ndivision of territory, which appears to be based upon the\r\necclesiastical partition of the country.\r\n{42}\r\nAfter their settlement in Great Britain, the Saxons did not\r\ndivide it into systematically determined portions, but adopted\r\nwhat they found already established. The portions of territory\r\nwhich were under the direction of the _decanus_, the\r\n_decanus ruralis_, and the bishop, formed respectively the\r\ntithing, the hundred, and the county. We must not, however,\r\nsuppose that these names correspond precisely to realities. The\r\ntithings and hundreds were not all equal in extent of soil and\r\nnumber of inhabitants. There were sixty-five hundreds in Sussex,\r\ntwenty-six in Yorkshire, and six in Lancashire. In the north of\r\nEngland, the hundreds bore another name; they were called\r\n_Wapentakes_. [Footnote 10] Here the ecclesiastical division\r\nceases, and a military circumscription prevailed, which still\r\nsubsists in some counties. An analogous circumscription has\r\ncontinued to the present day in the Grisons, in Switzerland.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 10: From _wapen_, weapons, and _tac_, a\r\n    touch, i. e. a shaking or striking of the arms; or from the\r\n    same _wapen_, and _tac_, a taking or receiving of\r\n    the vassal's arms by a new lord in token of subjection; or\r\n    because the people, in confirmation of union, touch the\r\n    weapon of their lord. See Blackstone, Introd., sec. 4. and\r\n    Holinshed, vol. v. p. 37.]\r\n\r\nThese divisions of the soil had a double object. On the one hand,\r\nthey formed the most certain means of insuring order and\r\ndiscipline; and on the other hand, they supplied the inhabitants\r\nwith the most convenient method for transacting their public\r\nbusiness in common.\r\n\r\nBy a police regulation which I have already mentioned, every free\r\nindividual, above twelve years of age, was obliged to enrol\r\nhimself in a certain association, which he could not abandon\r\nwithout the permission of the chief. A stranger might not remain\r\nfor more than two days with a friend, unless his host gave surety\r\nfor him, and at the end of forty days he was compelled to place\r\nhimself under the surveillance of some association. It is\r\nremarkable that the details of these laws of classification and\r\nsubordination were almost the same in all those parts of the\r\nRoman Empire occupied by the barbarians--in Gaul and Spain, as\r\nwell as in England. When one of the members of a special\r\nassociation had committed a crime, the association was obliged to\r\nbring him to trial. This point has given rise to much discussion\r\namong learned men.\r\n\r\n{43}\r\n         The County Courts.\r\n\r\nSome have maintained that the association was bail for its\r\nmembers, not only for their appearance before the court of\r\njustice, but also for the crime which they might have committed.\r\nI think that every Anglo-Saxon association was bound only to\r\nbring the culprit to trial. If he had made his escape, the\r\nassociation had to prove, sometimes by twelve and sometimes by\r\nthirty witnesses, that it knew nothing of his whereabouts; and it\r\nwas fined only when it could not produce witnesses to prove that\r\nit had not abetted his escape. This obligation of every local\r\ncorporation to pay for its guilty and absent members, existed\r\nalso in Gaul at this time. The Gallic corporation was moreover\r\nanswerable for the execution of the sentence: I do not think this\r\nwas the case in England, where it was bound only to bring the\r\nculprit to trial.\r\n\r\nThe second object of this division of the land was to appoint\r\ncentres of union, where the inhabitants might discuss matters of\r\ncommon interest. In every county, and in every subdivision of a\r\ncounty, the landowners held meetings, at which they deliberated\r\nupon the affairs of the local association to which they belonged.\r\nOriginally, therefore, there existed not only county-courts, but\r\nalso courts of hundred and courts of tithing, which frequently\r\nmet. By degrees, as the circle of the interests of these little\r\nassociations continually tended to become larger, the courts of\r\ntithing fell into desuetude. The courts of hundred survived for a\r\nlonger period, and even now retain some shadow of existence. The\r\nSaxons, however, dispersed over the country, and busied with\r\ntheir warlike and agricultural labours, gradually lost the habit\r\nof attending these meetings. Having scarcely any written rights\r\nto defend, and being seldom disturbed in their dwellings, they\r\nlived without anxiety for a liberty which was never called in\r\nquestion. The principal guarantee of the liberty of individuals\r\nat that time was their isolation: the active surveillance which\r\nit requires, when government exercises a direct and frequent\r\ninfluence upon the governed, would have been to them a useless\r\nand fatiguing burden. It devolved upon the kings to compel them,\r\nas it were, to keep up their old institutions. Athelstane\r\nordained that the county-courts should meet once in every three\r\nmonths. Few persons attended them, and it became necessary to\r\ngrant further indulgence. The county-courts were allowed to\r\nassemble only twice a year.\r\n{44}\r\nAll holders of land were entitled to attend their meetings. The\r\nmatters discussed were the internal administration of the county,\r\nthe maintenance of roads and bridges, the keeping in repair of\r\nthe forts which the Romans had constructed to defend the country\r\nagainst the invasions of the Picts and Scots, and which were\r\nstill used for the same purpose. All public business was\r\ntransacted in the county-court, under the presidency of the\r\n_alderman_. At its meetings, military forces were levied,\r\njustice was administered, and ecclesiastical affairs were treated\r\nof. All public acts, sales, manumissions, wills, were conducted\r\nbefore it, and the publicity of the assembly gave an authentic\r\ncharacter to these deeds. Every act, however, was authenticated\r\nby a certain number of witnesses, and the deeds were afterwards\r\ntranscribed and intercalated in the parish Bible.\r\n\r\n\r\n         _Origin of the Jury._\r\n\r\nIn these meetings, also, we discern the origin of the\r\n_Jury_. When there was a trial to be decided, the alderman\r\nsent a number of freemen belonging to the same class as the\r\ncontending parties, to the place where the dispute had occurred,\r\nin order to learn the facts of the case. These men were called\r\n_assessors_, and when they returned to the county-court,\r\nfurnished with the necessary information, they naturally became\r\nthe judges in the case which they had investigated. The\r\ncontending parties publicly pleaded their own cause, and were\r\nobliged to prove their right by witnesses, _compurgatores_.\r\nIt has been a question much debated whether the institution of\r\nthe jury arose from these witnesses, or from the assessors. In my\r\nopinion, it was the product of neither exclusively, but of both\r\ncombined. The establishment of a great institution has nearly\r\nalways something complex about it. The jury came into existence\r\nin some measure spontaneously, from the amalgamation of the\r\ndifferent classes of persons who combined to investigate and\r\ndecide the case. Under the Anglo-Saxon monarchy, it was not a\r\nvery clearly defined institution. It was not universally in\r\npractice, its rules were frequently infringed upon: and Alfred,\r\nwho was the restorer of the ancient institutions of the country,\r\nhanged an alderman who had given judgment without the\r\nco-operation of his assessors.\r\n\r\n{45}\r\n\r\n         Appointment Of Magistrates.\r\n\r\nThe presidents of these different territorial subdivisions, of\r\nthe county-courts, the hundred-courts, and the tithing-courts,\r\nwere at first elected by the landowners. I do not suppose the\r\nchoice was made by individual votes, but rather by a tacit\r\nconsent given to the personal influence of certain men.\r\nSometimes, however, to repair long disorders, and destroy the\r\ninjurious consequences of this influence, the central authority\r\ninterfered in the appointment of these magistrates. When Alfred\r\nhad vanquished the Danes, he was desirous to reform the abuses\r\nwhich the troubles of war had introduced into the administration\r\nof justice; he assumed the right of choosing the\r\n_centenarii_ and tithing-men, and this novelty was so far\r\nfrom being considered an usurpation of the rights of the nation,\r\nthat contemporary historians praise the monarch for having given\r\nthe people such good magistrates. The systematic conflict of the\r\nrulers with the ruled had not yet commenced; the limits of their\r\nrespective rights and duties were neither fixed nor recognised,\r\nand as power was not yet extravagant in its exactions, the people\r\ndid not feel their rights attacked; necessity, or temporary\r\nutility, were the tests which decided the value of a measure. We\r\ndo not find that the kings who succeeded Alfred retained this\r\nright of appointment. Under Edward the Confessor, the\r\ncounty-magistrates were chosen by the landowners. The conquest of\r\nWilliam the Norman destroyed, in great measure, these free\r\ncustoms. The alderman, the centenarius, and the tithing-man,\r\ndisappeared before the feudal lords, or became feudal lords\r\nthemselves. The assemblies of freemen, however, still retained\r\nthe right of appointing their respective officers. The sheriff\r\nwas substituted for the alderman, the centenarius merged in the\r\nhigh-constable, and the petty-constable took the place of the\r\ntithing-man. These were the officers of the people,--the\r\nmunicipal officers.\r\n\r\nSuch is a summary of the local institutions which, under the\r\nAnglo-Saxon monarchy, maintained the internal order of the state,\r\nand constituted the safeguards of public liberty. Vigorous\r\ninstitutions were they, which feudalism could not overthrow, and\r\nwhich produced, at a later period, representative government in\r\nEngland, although they did not contain, as you will presently\r\nsee, the true principle of representative government.\r\n\r\n{46}\r\n           The Wittenagemot.\r\n\r\nLet us now pass to central institutions. Of these, there were two\r\namong the Anglo-Saxons: the national assembly, and the royal\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nTacitus has described to you the general assemblies of the\r\nancient Germans. At those meetings, nothing was decided without\r\nthe consent of every freeman. Each individual possessed and\r\nexercised his own personal rights and influence. The influence of\r\nthe chiefs was great. The leaders of their men in war, they\r\nbecame, when their conquest was completed, the principal, indeed\r\nalmost the sole, landed proprietors, and thus they retained among\r\nthemselves, although the others were not legally excluded, the\r\npractice of forming national assemblies. Each kingdom of the\r\nSaxon Heptarchy had its own, and it is probable that the thanes,\r\nor landowners, enforced the adoption and execution of the\r\nresolutions of this assembly, among the ceorls who dwelt on their\r\nestates. When the Heptarchy was combined into a single kingdom,\r\none general assembly alone was established; and as its meetings\r\nwere held in a central locality, at a great distance from many\r\nparts of the realm, the large proprietors were the only persons\r\nwho were able to attend regularly. This assembly was called the\r\n_Wittenagemot_, or the assembly of the wise men. From\r\nhistorical documents, we learn that it was composed of bishops,\r\nabbots, abbesses, dukes, and earls; but we also find these words,\r\nthe vagueness of which has given rise to very different\r\nexplanations: \"such a decision was taken _coram proceribus\r\naliorumque fidelium infinitâ multitudine._\" Some learned men,\r\nwho are partisans of absolute power, have inferred from this that\r\nit existed at the very origin of society; and they assert that\r\nthe name of the assembly, _Wittenagemot_, was in itself\r\nsufficient to prove that it was composed only of the judges and\r\ndelegates of the sovereign. Other writers, who are zealous\r\nadvocates of the rights of the people, have held the opinion that\r\nthis multitude of persons present were the representatives of the\r\nvarious counties and boroughs. I think that both these systems\r\nare false. As regards the first, it is evident that there was no\r\ndistinct class of judges at this period; public functionaries\r\nwere, not then classified as they are now, and the expression\r\n_wise men_ would apply equally to all those whose condition\r\nraised them above the 'vulgar herd.' With reference to the second\r\nsystem, I must say that no idea of representation was entertained\r\nat that period.\r\n\r\n{47}\r\n\r\n             Its Members.\r\n\r\nWhoever was entitled to attend the assembly went thither, and\r\nwent in person. No proxies were allowed. No one was permitted to\r\nenter the assembly in any name but his own. When we come to treat\r\nof the principles of representative government, we shall see that\r\nthe formation of the ancient Germanic assemblies was based upon\r\nthe principles of individual right, and of the sovereignty of the\r\nmultitude,--principles from which representative government did\r\nnot take its origin. Besides, the towns at this period were in so\r\nmiserable a condition, that it was impossible for them to appoint\r\nrepresentatives. York, the second city in England, contained\r\nfourteen hundred and eighteen families, and Bath sixty-four. A\r\nlaw of King Athelstane declares that no one entered, or could\r\nenter, the assembly, except upon his own account; every\r\nproprietor possessing five hides of land, it says, and every\r\nmerchant who has made three voyages to foreign countries, shall\r\nbe numbered among the thanes, and be admitted as such into the\r\nWittenagemot. The inequality of conditions, however, continued to\r\nincrease. Those national assemblies, in which, originally, all\r\nfreemen were entitled to sit, soon became, as you have seen,\r\nrestricted to landed proprietors. By-and-bye, as power became\r\ncentralized, and predominant influences gained greater strength,\r\nthe small proprietors ceased to use a right which had lost all\r\nvalue to them, and the large landowners remained the undisputed\r\nmasters of the field. The disproportion between the two classes\r\nwas so great, that a contest was impossible. As each man sat in\r\nhis own name, each man brought his own personal influence and\r\nprivate interests with him. The general assembly became an arena\r\nfor individual disputes. This was the necessary consequence of a\r\nprinciple, which, by summoning all persons to exercise the same\r\nright, placed inequalities in that position which was most\r\nfavourable to the development of their power and egotism. It is\r\nthe work of a widely different principle to seek out among the\r\nmasses the persons best fitted to represent them, to send these\r\nindividuals to the central assembly to provide for the safety of\r\nall rights in the name of justice, and thus to prevent the evil\r\nconsequences which must result from the natural or social\r\ninequality of mankind, by creating a factitious, but just,\r\nequality among their representatives, which leaves them only the\r\nlegitimate influence of their talents and character.\r\n\r\n{48}\r\n\r\n        Character of The Anglo-Saxon Monarchy.\r\n\r\nBut the foundation of such a government is the work of ages.\r\nNations, in their infancy, cannot possess it. The Anglo-Saxon\r\nmonarchy was a continual conflict of individual interests, which\r\nwas carried on in the Wittenagemot, as well as elsewhere, and its\r\ngeneral tendency was to the continually increasing preponderance\r\nof large landed property.\r\n\r\n{49}\r\n\r\n                  Lecture V.\r\n\r\n  The Wittenagemot; its business and power.\r\n\r\n  Method of its convocation.\r\n\r\n  Vicissitudes of its character and importance.\r\n\r\n  The kingly office among the Anglo-Saxons.\r\n\r\n  Extent and progress of the royal power.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Business Of The Wittenagemot.\r\n\r\nWe have already considered the origin and composition of the\r\nWittenagemot, or general assembly of the Anglo-Saxons, it now\r\nremains for us to speak of its attributes and method of\r\nconvocation.\r\n\r\nIn the infancy of society, everything is confused and uncertain;\r\nthere is as yet no fixed and precise line of demarcation between\r\nthe different powers in a state; and thus we find that the\r\nattributes of the Wittenagemot were rather indefinite. There was\r\nno settled boundary at which its power ceased, and that of the\r\nmonarchy commenced; both united to transact all the business of\r\nthe nation, and, if we would ascertain the part actually taken by\r\nthe Wittenagemot in this business, we must inquire of history\r\nwhat were its real attributes.\r\n\r\nThe defence of the kingdom was the chief business of the national\r\nassemblies. We must not suppose that the obligation of military\r\nservice is coeval only with feudalism; independently of every\r\nfeudal bond, it was an obligation imposed on every freeman in the\r\nnation, just as at the present day every French citizen is bound\r\nto present himself for conscription. The Wittenagemot ordered\r\nlevies of the landowners, who, in their turn, convoked the\r\nfreemen resident on their estates.\r\n\r\nThe Wittenagemot also imposed taxes; at that period, however,\r\nthere were hardly any public taxes; the first was levied in\r\nconsequence of the Danish invasion, and the law which imposed it\r\nexpressly states that it received the consent of all the members\r\npresent in the Wittenagemot.\r\n\r\n{50}\r\n\r\nThe county-courts, as we have seen, provided for the maintenance\r\nof the public roads, bridges, and forts. We learn from the\r\ndeliberations of the Anglo-Saxon national assembly, that such\r\nmatters fell under its cognizance also.\r\n\r\nAs the right of coining money did not belong exclusively to the\r\nking, but was also possessed by the church and by many powerful\r\nsubjects, the Wittenagemot had the oversight of this matter, and\r\nprevented the debasement of the coinage.\r\n\r\nWe also find it ratifying or annulling those acts of\r\ncounty-courts which had reference not to private matters, but to\r\naffairs of general importance.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the responsibility of the agents of power was\r\nnot more clearly and firmly established in the Anglo-Saxon\r\nmonarchy than the other great principles of free government; but\r\nit was, nevertheless, confusedly practised. A vague feeling of\r\njustice pervaded these national assemblies; they repressed great\r\nabuses, but frequently punished injustice by injustice.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Oversight Of The Royal Domain.\r\n\r\nThe Wittenagemot in England possessed a power which was not\r\ngenerally exercised by corresponding assemblies on the Continent;\r\nit had the oversight of the royal domain. Originally, the kings\r\nlived, like other landowners, on the income derived from their\r\nown private estates. Their property was a private domain, which\r\nthey managed as they pleased. As time rolled on, this domain\r\nbecame very largely augmented by confiscations; but the kings,\r\ncompelled to defend their tottering authority from the frequent\r\nattacks to which it was subjected, were incessantly diminishing\r\ntheir estates by gifts to powerful and formidable chiefs.\r\nFrequently, also, when they were strong, they resumed the gifts\r\nwhich necessity had extorted from them. The little reliance to be\r\nplaced upon these purely royal donations, unless they were\r\nratified by the consent of the national assembly; and the\r\nknowledge that, if the king were permitted these forced\r\ndilapidations of his own domains, the Wittenagemot would one day\r\nbe obliged to repair them, and compensate the monarch for the\r\nloss of his private estates,--were the reasons which led to the\r\ninterference of the national assembly in the administration of\r\nthe royal domain. In France, this domain did not fall so soon\r\nunder the influence of the national assemblies, but remained for\r\na much longer period the private property of the kings.\r\n\r\n{51}\r\n         Direction Of Ecclesiastical Affairs.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important attributes of the Wittenagemot was the\r\ndirection of ecclesiastical affairs. The abbots and bishops,\r\nindeed all the high clergy, were members of this assembly. In\r\nFrance, although the clergy formed a part of the national\r\nassemblies, they treated of their own affairs as a separate body,\r\nand communicated directly with the king. In England,\r\necclesiastical matters, like all other business, were discussed\r\nin the general assembly. For instance, when missionaries from\r\nRome came to invite the kings of the Heptarchy to embrace the\r\nChristian religion, the kings replied that they must ask the\r\nconsent of the Wittenagemot. In Sweden, the king, who had already\r\nbecome a convert himself, proposed to the assembled Diet to adopt\r\nChristianity. The Diet sanctioned the new religion, but retained\r\nthe old creed, and this simultaneous practice of the two\r\nreligions lasted for a considerable time. The Wittenagemot had\r\nnot always to discuss such important matters as the conversion of\r\nthe nation; it appointed bishops, and ordained or sanctioned the\r\nfoundation of abbeys and monasteries.\r\n\r\nThe last business of the Anglo-Saxon national assembly was to\r\nreceive complaints and petitions in denunciation of abuses. It\r\nthus became sometimes a judicial court, adjudicating on the\r\nappeals of large landowners; but it seldom appears in this\r\ncharacter: it was especially a political assembly, whilst, on the\r\nContinent, the national assembly frequently acted as a judicial\r\ntribunal.\r\n\r\nI have now pointed out the various functions of the Wittenagemot,\r\nand you have been able, from the acts of that assembly, to form a\r\ntolerably accurate idea of it. As regards its convocation,\r\noriginally its meetings were frequent, but in order not to\r\nfatigue its members too much, it became necessary to reduce the\r\nmeetings to two, held in spring and autumn, as on the Continent.\r\nThe right of convoking the Wittenagemot became, ere long, one of\r\nthe prerogatives of the crown. This abandonment of so important a\r\nprivilege is very characteristic of an age in which political\r\nprudence is unknown, and distrust is manifested only at rare\r\nintervals, and then by revolt. It seemed natural that the king,\r\nthe direct centre of all the interests and necessities of the\r\nnation, should convoke the assembly for exigencies with which he\r\nwas better acquainted than any other person; at his death, the\r\nlarge landowners assembled spontaneously, to deliberate on a\r\nchange of dynasty or the arrangement of the succession.\r\n\r\n{52}\r\n\r\nThe inviolability of the members of the Wittenagemot was\r\nrecognized from the day on which they set out to attend the\r\nassembly, till the day on which they returned home again,\r\nprovided they were not notorious brigands.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Character Of The Wittenagemot.\r\n\r\nSumming up what I have said, the general assembly of the\r\nAnglo-Saxons, as of most of the German nations, was, in Germany,\r\ncomposed of every freeman; after the conquest, it consisted only\r\nof the landowners; and, towards the end of the monarchy, it was\r\nattended by none but the most wealthy proprietors. Each man came\r\nin his own right, and on his own behalf; according to a charter\r\nof King Athelstane, he might send a proxy in his place. This\r\nirrefragable mark of individual right still exists in England. In\r\nthe House of Peers, every peer may vote by proxy and in his own\r\nname. It is from the Wittenagemot, in this last phase of its\r\nexistence, and from the rights of suzerainty which Norman\r\nfeudalism conferred on the king over the great barons, who held\r\ntheir titles directly from him, that the English House of Peers,\r\nas it now exists, derives its origin. In the Wittenagemot of the\r\nlast age of the Anglo-Saxon monarchy, we can discern neither of\r\nthe two elements which composed the House of Commons at a later\r\nperiod. The towns had hardly any existence, and could not,\r\ntherefore, send deputies: the counties had never sent any. The\r\nWittenagemot was only an assembly of the powerful men of the\r\nstate, who came on their own account, and in their own personal\r\nright. Most other persons neglected rights which were too\r\ndifficult for them to exercise, and the real impotence of which\r\nthey felt; by neglecting to exercise them, they eventually lost\r\nthem; and when the exigencies of liberty occurred to agitate a\r\nmore advanced and less contented state of society, a new labour\r\nwas necessary to restore to the citizens, rights which they had\r\nallowed to perish, through the want of necessity and capacity.\r\n\r\n{53}\r\n\r\n         The Kingly Office.\r\n\r\nThe second of the central institutions of the Anglo-Saxons, was\r\nthe kingly office. An important fact has distinguished the\r\nformation of all states of Germanic origin, and this is, the\r\nspeedy establishment of hereditary monarchy,--which was the\r\ndominant character of this institution at this period, whatever\r\nmixture of election may be discerned therein. The causes of this\r\nare simple. In warlike tribes, there is, in war at least, a\r\nsingle chieftain; the man of greatest valour and largest\r\nexperience, says to his comrades, \"Come with me--I will lead you\r\nwhere you may obtain rich booty;\" his proposition is accepted,\r\nand by common consent he becomes the leader of the expedition.\r\nThus, at the origin of society, power is not conferred; he who is\r\nable to do so, assumes it by the consent of the others. There is\r\nno election properly so called, but only a recognition of\r\nauthority. The leader who has conducted one or more fortunate\r\nexpeditions, obtains great importance by success; his influence\r\nincreases with time, and he hands down to his family the\r\ninfluence and power which he has acquired. This family, thus\r\ninvested with an actual superiority, gains a natural habit of\r\ncommand, which the others soon grow accustomed to acknowledge.\r\nAmong the Germans, moreover, the idea of religious filiation\r\ncontributed powerfully to the establishment of hereditary\r\nmonarchy. It was almost a national duty to choose kings from the\r\ndivine race; and all the royal families were descendants of Odin.\r\n\r\nThus hereditary monarchy prevailed among these peoples; but\r\nchoice among the members of the royal family long existed. It was\r\nindispensably necessary that the king should be a capable man, in\r\na state of society in which men were as yet ignorant of the\r\nartificial means which supply the deficiencies of royal\r\nincapacity. Thus Alfred himself did not simply found his right to\r\nthe throne on a will of his father, and an agreement with his\r\nbrother; but he based it especially upon the consent of all the\r\nlarge proprietors of the kingdom of Wessex. Force sometimes gave\r\nsevere checks to hereditary right; but the usurpation of the\r\nthrone was always associated with the idea of the violation of a\r\nright, and the usurpers invariably strove to atone for this\r\nviolation, by marriage with one of the legitimate race.\r\n\r\n{54}\r\n\r\n           Duties Of The Kings.\r\n\r\nThe kings, under the Anglo-Saxon monarchy, were at first called\r\n_Heretogs_, leaders of armies; but it is a mistake to\r\nexplain and limit their prerogatives by the name which they bore.\r\nThe power of arms was then so great, and all other powers seemed\r\nso inferior and subject to it, that they all fell under the\r\ngeneric term which contained within itself nearly every idea of\r\nforce and empire. The most different powers were embraced under\r\nthis single denomination, and we must not suppose that the kings\r\nlimited their functions to those which it seems to indicate; the\r\nAnglo-Saxon kings were not merely military leaders; they managed\r\nall the internal administration of the realm, in concert with the\r\nWittenagemot. Their attributes were not more determinate than\r\nthose of that assembly. With it, they directed all the affairs of\r\nthe nation; and their surveillance, being perpetual, was more\r\nclose and active. They were addressed as the highest authority,\r\nand also as possessing the most information on public affairs.\r\nThus the right of presiding over the general assemblies and\r\nproposing the subjects for deliberation, belonged exclusively to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe royal authority, however, not being sustained by a strong and\r\nregular organization, decreased in power in proportion as the\r\ngreat proprietors increased in influence and became firmly\r\nestablished in their domains. Towards the end of the Anglo-Saxon\r\nmonarchy, the large landowners, sole masters on their own\r\nestates, began to do everything by themselves. They coined money,\r\nadministered justice, and levied soldiers. And we must not\r\nimagine that this assumption of sovereign rights by local\r\nchieftains was regarded, by the people, as an act of iniquity and\r\nviolence: it was a necessity of the social condition of the\r\ncountry. Royalty was no more capable of wielding all the central\r\npower, than the nation was of maintaining and exercising all its\r\nliberties.\r\n\r\n{55}\r\n\r\n                Lecture VI.\r\n\r\n  The true principle of representative government.\r\n\r\n  Error of classifying governments according to their external\r\n  forms.\r\n\r\n  Montesquieu's error with respect to the origin of the\r\n  representative system.\r\n\r\n  Necessary correlation and simultaneous formation of\r\n  society and government.\r\n\r\n  Rousseau's mistaken hypothesis of the social contract.\r\n\r\n  The nature of rightful sovereignty.\r\n\r\n  Confused and contradictory ideas entertained on this subject.\r\n\r\n  Societies, as individuals, possess the right of being placed\r\n  under laws of justice and reason.\r\n\r\n  Governments ought to be continually reminded of their\r\n  obligation to inquire into and conform to these laws.\r\n\r\n  Classification of governments on this principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Principle Of Representative Government.\r\n\r\nI propose to examine the political institutions of modern Europe\r\nin their early infancy, and to seek what they have in common with\r\nthe representative system of government. My object will be to\r\nlearn whether this form of government had then attained to any\r\ndegree of development, or even existed only in germ; at what\r\ntimes, and in what places it first appeared, where and under what\r\ncircumstances it prospered or failed. I have just examined the\r\nprimitive institutions of the Anglo-Saxons. Before leaving our\r\nconsideration of England, it might be well for me to compare\r\nthese institutions with the essential type of representative\r\ngovernment, in order to see how they agree and in what they\r\ndiffer. But this type is not yet in our possession. In order to\r\nfind it I shall revert to the essential principle of\r\nrepresentative government, to the original ideas out of which it\r\nsprings; and I shall compare this idea with the fundamental idea\r\nthat underlies Anglo-Saxon institutions.\r\n\r\n{56}\r\n\r\n         Error Of Montesquieu.\r\n\r\nThe human mind is naturally led to judge of the nature of things,\r\nand to classify them according to their exterior forms;\r\naccordingly, governments have almost invariably been arranged\r\naccording to distinctions which do not at all belong to their\r\ninherent character. Wherever none of those positive institutions\r\nhave been immediately recognized which, according to our present\r\nnotions, represent and guarantee political liberty, it has been\r\nthought that no liberty could exist, and that power must be\r\nabsolute. But in human affairs, various elements are mingled:\r\nnothing exists in a simple and pure state. As some traces of\r\nabsolute power are to be found at the basis of free governments,\r\nso also some liberty has existed under governments to all\r\nappearance founded on absolutism. No form of society is\r\ncompletely devoid of reason and justice,--for were all reason and\r\njustice to be withdrawn, society would perish. We may sometimes\r\nsee governments of apparently the most opposite character produce\r\nthe same effects. During the seventeenth and eighteenth\r\ncenturies, representative government raised England to the\r\nhighest elevation of moral and material prosperity; and France,\r\nduring that same period, increased in splendour, wealth, and\r\nenlightenment, under an absolute monarchy. I do not intend by\r\nthis to insinuate the impression that forms of government are\r\nunimportant, and that all produce results of equal quality and\r\nvalue; I merely wish to hint that we should not appreciate them\r\nby only a few of their results, or by their exterior indications.\r\nIn order fully to appreciate a government, we must penetrate into\r\nits essential and constituent principles. We shall then perceive\r\nthat many governments which differ considerably in their forms,\r\nare referable to the same principles; and that others which\r\nappear to resemble one another in their forms, are in fundamental\r\nrespects different. Wherever elections and assemblies have\r\npresented themselves to view, it has been thought that the\r\nelements of a representative system were to be found.\r\nMontesquieu, looking at representative government in England,\r\nendeavoured to trace it back to the old Germanic institutions.\r\n\"This noble system,\" he says, \"originated in the woods.\"\r\nAppearances deceived Montesquieu; he merely took into\r\nconsideration the exterior characteristics of representative\r\ngovernment, not its true principles and its true tendencies. That\r\nis a superficial and false method which classifies governments\r\naccording to their exterior characteristics; making monarchy,\r\ngovernment by one individual; aristocracy, government by several;\r\ndemocracy, government by the people, the sovereignty of all. This\r\nclassification, which is based only upon one particular fact, and\r\nupon a certain material shape which power assumes, does not go to\r\nthe heart of those questions, or rather of that question, by the\r\nsolution of which the nature and tendency of governments is\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\n{57}\r\n\r\n         Society And Government.\r\n\r\nThis question is, \"What is the source of the sovereign power, and\r\nwhat is its limit? Whence does it come, and where does it stop?\"\r\nIn the answer to this question is involved the real principle of\r\ngovernment; for it is this principle whose influence, direct or\r\nindirect, latent or obvious, gives to societies their tendency\r\nand their fate.\r\n\r\nWhere are we to look for this principle? Is it a mere\r\nconventional arrangement by man? Is its existence anterior to\r\nthat of society?\r\n\r\nThe two facts--society and government--mutually imply one\r\nanother; society without government is no more possible than\r\ngovernment without society. The very idea of society necessarily\r\nimplies that of rule, of universal law, that is to say, of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nWhat then is the first social law? I hasten to pronounce it: it\r\nis justice, reason, a rule of which every man has the germ within\r\nhis own breast. If man only yields to a superior force, he does\r\nnot truly submit to the law; there is no society and no\r\ngovernment. If in his dealings with his fellows, man obeys not\r\nonly force, but also a law, then society and government exist. In\r\nthe abnegation of force, and obedience to law, consists the\r\nfundamental principle of society and government. In the absence\r\nof these two conditions, neither society nor government can be\r\nproperly said to exist.\r\n\r\nThis necessary coexistence of society and government shows the\r\nabsurdity of the hypothesis of the social contract. Rousseau\r\npresents us with the picture of men already united together into\r\na society, but without rule, and exerting themselves to create\r\none; as if society did not itself presuppose the existence of a\r\nrule to which it was indebted for its existence. If there is no\r\nrule, there is no society; there are only individuals united and\r\nkept together by force. This hypothesis then, of a primitive\r\ncontract, as the only legitimate source of social law, rests upon\r\nan assumption that is necessarily false and impossible.\r\n\r\n{58}\r\n\r\n         Principle Of Government.\r\n\r\nThe opposite hypothesis, which places the origin of society in\r\nthe family and in the right of the father over his children, is\r\nless objectionable, but it is incomplete. There is, certainly, a\r\nform of society among parents and their rising offspring; but it\r\nis a society in some sort unilateral, and of which one of the\r\nparties has not any true consciousness. Society, whether in the\r\nfamily or out of the family, is only complete when all its\r\nmembers, those who command as well as those who obey, recognize,\r\nmore or less vaguely, a certain superior rule, which is neither\r\nthe arbitrary caprice of will, nor the effect of force alone. The\r\nidea of society, therefore, implies necessarily another idea,\r\nthat of government; and the idea of government contains in it two\r\nothers, the idea of a collection of individuals, and that of a\r\nrule which is applicable to them,--a rule which constitutes the\r\nright of the government itself; a rule which the individuals who\r\nsubmit to it have not themselves created, and to which they are\r\nmorally bound to submit. No government ever totally disregarded\r\nthis supreme rule, none ever proclaimed force or caprice as the\r\nonly law of society. In seeking the principle of government, we\r\nhave found the principle of social right to be the primary source\r\nof all legitimate sovereignty. In this law of laws, in this rule\r\nof all government, resides the principle of government.\r\n\r\nTwo important questions now present themselves. How is the law\r\nformed, and how is it applied? In this lies the distinctive\r\ncharacter of the various forms of government; in this they\r\ndiffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Right of Sovereignty.\r\n\r\nEven until modern times, the belief has prevailed that the\r\nprimitive and absolute right of law-making, that is, the right of\r\nsovereignty, resides in some portion of society, whether this\r\nright be vested in a single man, in several, or in all; an\r\nopinion which has been constantly contradicted by facts, and\r\nwhich cannot bear the test of reason. The right of determining\r\nand enforcing a rule, is the right to absolute power; that force\r\nwhich possesses this right inherently, possesses absolute power,\r\nthat is to say, the right of tyranny. Take the three great forms\r\nof government, monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy, and see if a\r\ncase can be found in which the right of sovereignty was held by\r\none, by several or by all, in which tyranny did not necessarily\r\narise. Facts have been logically correct,--they have inferred\r\nfrom the principle its necessary consequence.\r\n\r\n{59}\r\n\r\nSuch, however, is the force of truth, that this error could not\r\nreign alone and absolutely. At the very time when men appeared to\r\nbelieve, and did theoretically believe, that the primitive and\r\nabsolute power of giving law belonged to some one, whether\r\nmonarch, senate, or people, at the same time they struggled\r\nagainst that principle. At all times men have endeavoured to\r\nlimit the power which they regarded as perfectly legitimate.\r\nNever has a force, although invested with the right of\r\nsovereignty, been allowed to develop that right to its full\r\nextent. The janissaries in Turkey sometimes served, sometimes\r\nabrogated, the absolute power of the Sultan. In democracies,\r\nwhere the right of sovereignty is vested in popular assemblies,\r\nefforts have been continually made to oppose conditions,\r\nobstacles, and limits to that sovereignty. Always, in all\r\ngovernments which are absolute in principle, some kind of protest\r\nhas been made against the principle. Whence comes this universal\r\nprotest? We might, looking merely at the surface of things, be\r\ntempted to say that it is only a struggle of powers. This has\r\nexisted without doubt, but another and a grander element has\r\nexisted along with it; there is an instinctive sense of justice\r\nand reason dwelling in every human spirit. Tyranny has been\r\nopposed, whether it were the tyranny of individuals or of\r\nmultitudes, not only by a consciousness of power, but by a\r\nsentiment of right. It is this consciousness of justice and\r\nright, that is to say, of a rule independent of human will,--a\r\nconsciousness often obscure but always powerful,--which, sooner\r\nor later, rouses and assists men to resist all tyranny, whatever\r\nmay be its name and form. The voice of humanity, then, has\r\nproclaimed that the right of sovereignty vested in men, whether\r\nin one, in many, or in all, is an iniquitous lie.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the right of sovereignty cannot be vested in any one\r\nman, or collection of men, where does it reside, and what is the\r\nprinciple on which it rests?\r\n\r\n\r\n           True Law Of Society.\r\n\r\nIn his interior life,--in his dealings with himself, if I may be\r\nallowed the expression, as well as in his exterior life, and in\r\nhis dealings with his fellows,--the man who feels himself free\r\nand capable of action, has ever a glimpse of a natural law by\r\nwhich his action is regulated. He recognises a something which is\r\nnot his own will, and which must regulate his will. He feels\r\nhimself bound by reason or morality to do certain things; he\r\nsees, or he feels that there are certain things which he ought or\r\nought not to do.\r\n{60}\r\nThis something is the law which is superior to man, and made for\r\nhim--the divine law. The true law of man is not the work of man;\r\nhe receives, but does not create it; even when he submits to it,\r\nit is not his own,--it is beyond and above him.\r\n\r\nMan does not always submit; in the exercise of his free will and\r\nimperfect nature, he does not invariably obey this law. He is\r\ninfluenced by other principles of action than this, and although\r\nhe perceives that the motives which impel him are vicious,\r\nnevertheless he often yields to them. But whether he obey or not,\r\nthe supreme law for man is always existent--in his wildest dreams\r\nhe recognises it, as placed above him.\r\n\r\nWe see, then, the individual always in presence of a law,--one\r\nwhich he did not create, but which asserts its claim over him,\r\nand never abandons him. If he enters into society with his\r\nfellows, or finds himself thus associated, what other rule than\r\nthis will he possess? Should human society involve an abdication\r\nof human nature? No; man in society must and does remain\r\nessentially the same as in his individual capacity; and as\r\nsociety is nothing but a collection of individuals, the supreme\r\nlaw of society must be the same as that which exercises a\r\nrightful control over individuals themselves.\r\n\r\nHere, then, have we discovered the true law of society,--the law\r\nof government;--it is the same law as that which binds\r\nindividuals. And as, for an individual, the true law is often\r\nobscure, and as the individual, even when he knows it thoroughly,\r\ndoes not always follow it implicitly; in the same manner with\r\nregard to government, whatever it may be, its true law,--which\r\nmust ever reach it through the medium of the human mind, which is\r\never biassed by passion and limited by frailty,--is neither at\r\nall times apprehended nor always obeyed. It is then impossible to\r\nattribute to one man or to several the possession of an inherent\r\nright to sovereignty, since this would be to suppose that their\r\nideas and inclinations were in all cases correspondent to the\r\ndictates of justice and of reason,--a supposition which the\r\nradical imperfection of our nature will not allow us for a moment\r\nto admit.\r\n\r\n{61}\r\n           Classification Of Governments.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, owing to the same imperfection that men have\r\naccepted, or rather created for themselves, idols and tyrants. A\r\nlaw ready made for them has appeared more convenient than that\r\nlaborious and unremitting search after reason and justice which\r\nthey felt themselves obliged to undertake by the imperious voice\r\nof that conscience which they could not entirely silence.\r\nNevertheless, men have never been able entirely to deceive their\r\nconscience, or to stifle its utterances. Conscience defeats all\r\nthe arrangements of human ignorance or indifference, and forces\r\nmen to fight for themselves despite their own unwillingness.\r\nNever, in fact, have men fully accepted the sovereignty, the\r\nright of which they have admitted; and the impossibility of their\r\nthus consenting to it, plainly indicates the superhuman principle\r\nwhich sovereignty involves. In this principle we must seek for\r\nthe true distinction between governments.\r\n\r\nThe classification which I am about to present is not, then, one\r\nthat is merely arbitrary and factitious; it does not concern the\r\nexterior forms, but the essential nature of governments. I\r\ndistinguish two kinds. First, there are those which attribute\r\nsovereignty as a right belonging exclusively to individuals,\r\nwhether one, many, or all those composing a society; and these\r\nare, in principle, the founders of despotism, although facts\r\nalways protest more or less strongly against the principle; and\r\nabsolute obedience on the one hand, and absolute power on the\r\nother, never exist in full vigour. The second class of\r\ngovernments is founded on the truth that sovereignty belongs as a\r\nright to no individual whatever, since the perfect and continued\r\napprehension, the fixed and inviolable application of justice and\r\nof reason, do not belong to our imperfect nature.\r\n\r\nRepresentative government rests upon this truth. I do not say\r\nthat it has been founded upon the full reflective acknowledgment\r\nof the principle in the form in which I have stated it.\r\nGovernments do not, any more than great poems, form themselves on\r\nan _à priori_ model, and in accordance with defined\r\nprecepts. What I affirm is, that representative government does\r\nnot attribute sovereignty as inherently residing in any\r\nperson,--that all its powers are directed to the discovery and\r\nfaithful fulfilment of that rule which ought ever to govern their\r\naction, and that the right of sovereignty is only recognised on\r\nthe condition that it should be continually justified.\r\n\r\n{62}\r\n\r\n          Aim Of Representative Government.\r\n\r\nPascal has said, \"Plurality which does not reduce itself to\r\nunity, is confusion. Unity which is not the result of plurality,\r\nis tyranny.\" This is the happiest expression and the most exact\r\ndefinition of representative government. The plurality is\r\nsociety; the unity is truth, is the united force of the laws of\r\njustice and reason, which ought to govern society. If society\r\nremains in the condition of plurality, if isolated wills do not\r\ncombine under the guidance of common rules, if they do not all\r\nequally recognise justice and reason, if they do not reduce\r\nthemselves to unity, there is no society, there is only\r\nconfusion. And the unity which does not arise from plurality,\r\nwhich has been violently imposed upon it by one or many, whatever\r\nmay be their number, in virtue of a prerogative which they\r\nappropriate as their exclusive possession, is a false and\r\narbitrary unity; it is tyranny. The aim of representative\r\ngovernment is to oppose a barrier at once to tyranny and to\r\nconfusion, and to bring plurality to unity by presenting itself\r\nfor its recognition and acceptance.\r\n\r\nLet us now see, in the central fact of this method of government,\r\nby what means it arrives at its end, and under what forms its\r\nprinciple is developed.\r\n\r\nRepresentative government, wherever it has existed or does exist,\r\nis composed of different elements of power, equal among\r\nthemselves, although one of them, the monarchical or the\r\ndemocratic, ordinarily retains certain peculiar rights. The\r\nnumber and form of these powers are not necessarily determinate\r\nor equal; in France, at the present time, there are three, the\r\nroyal power, the House of Peers, and the Chamber of Deputies.\r\nThese three powers emanate from different sources, and result\r\nfrom different social necessities. Neither of them, isolated from\r\nthe rest, possesses a right of sovereignty: it is required of\r\nthem that they seek the legitimate rule in common, and they are\r\nsupposed to possess it only when they have found it in a united\r\ndeliberation, before or after action. Society owes submission to\r\nthis rule, thus discovered; but as these powers are not all fixed\r\nand immutable, so the sovereignty of right does not reside\r\nconstantly among them. The elective principle, which is by its\r\nvery nature changeful, can alter its idea and purpose, and\r\nexercise upon the other powers an influence that is periodically\r\nvariable.\r\n{63}\r\nIf the different powers do not agree, they reduce themselves\r\nimmediately to inaction. The sovereignty which exists in its own\r\nright then seems to hesitate to show itself, and government\r\nremains in suspense. In order to extricate it from this state,\r\nthe right has been reserved to royalty of creating peers, and of\r\ndissolving the Chamber of Deputies. The powers then proceed\r\nafresh to seek for the true law, a work in which they ought not\r\nto rest until they have found it. Thus, no power is judged to\r\npossess fully the legitimate rule, which is rightfully the\r\nprinciple of sovereignty. The electors themselves are not its\r\nabsolute interpreters, any more than are the peers, the deputies,\r\nor the king. The electors do not say at the outset to their\r\ndeputies, \"Such is our will: let that be the law.\" They enjoin\r\nupon them nothing precise; they simply confer upon them the\r\nmission of examining and deciding according to their reason. They\r\nmust necessarily trust in the enlightenment of those whom they\r\nelect; election is a trial imposed on those who aspire to\r\npolitical power, and a sovereign but limited right exercised by\r\nthose who confer political power upon such of the claimants as\r\nthey may select.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Political Rights Of The Nation.\r\n\r\nFrom the political powers thus attributed to certain classes, let\r\nus now pass to the political rights which are vaguely distributed\r\nin the nation. These rights are among the essential conditions of\r\nrepresentative government. The publicity of the debates in the\r\ndeliberative assemblies imposes upon these powers the necessity\r\nof commending themselves to that sense of reason and justice\r\nwhich belongs to all, in order that every citizen may be\r\nconvinced that their inquiries have been made with fidelity and\r\nintelligence, and that, knowing wherein they are deficient, he\r\nmay himself have the opportunity, if he has the capacity, to\r\nindicate the remedy. Liberty opens up a career for this inquiry.\r\nIn this way, every citizen may aid in the discovery of the true\r\nlaw. Thus does a representative government impel the whole body\r\nof society,--those who exercise power, and those who possess\r\nrights,--to enter upon a common search after reason and justice;\r\nit invites the multitude to reduce itself to unity, and it brings\r\nforth unity from the midst of plurality. The public\r\npowers,--royalty, the deliberative houses, the electors,--are\r\nbound and incessantly made to return to this work, by the\r\nessential nature of their relations, and by the laws of their\r\naction.\r\n\r\n{64}\r\n         Effects Of Publicity.\r\n\r\nPrivate citizens even can co-operate, by virtue of the publicity\r\nof the debates, and the liberty of the press. I might pursue this\r\nidea, and show that all the institutions which are regarded as\r\ninherent in representative government, even those which have not\r\nbeen regarded as assisting in the search for those general rules\r\nwhich ought to preside in the conduct of government, are derived\r\nfrom the same principle, and tend to the same result. The\r\npublicity of judicial proceedings, and those who compose the\r\njury, for example, supply a guarantee for the legitimate\r\napplication of the law to particular cases. But our present\r\nconcern is especially to determine the principle of those\r\nessential combinations by which a representative government is\r\nconstituted; they all proceed evidently from this fact, that no\r\nindividual is fully acquainted with and invariably consents to\r\nthat reason, truth and justice, which can alone confer the right\r\nof sovereignty, and which ought to be the rule of sovereignty as\r\nactually exercised. They compel all powers to seek for this rule,\r\nand give to all citizens the right of assisting in this research,\r\nby taking cognizance of the mode in which the powers proceed to\r\nit, and in declaring themselves what they conceive to be the\r\ndictates of justice and of truth. In other words, to sum up what\r\nI have said, representative government rests in reality upon the\r\nfollowing series of ideas. All power which exists as a fact,\r\nmust, in order to become a right, act according to reason,\r\njustice, and truth, the sole sources of right. No man, and no\r\nbody of men, can know and perform fully all that is required by\r\nreason, justice, and truth; but they have the faculty to discover\r\nit, and can be brought more and more to conform to it in their\r\nconduct. All the combinations of the political machine then ought\r\nto tend, on the one hand, to extract whatever of reason, justice,\r\nor truth, exists in society, in order to apply it to the\r\npractical requirements of government; and, on the other hand, to\r\npromote the progress of society in reason, justice, and truth,\r\nand constantly to embody this progress of society in the actual\r\nstructure of the government.\r\n\r\n{65}\r\n\r\n                  Lecture VII.\r\n\r\n  Comparison of the principles of different governments with the\r\n  true principle of representative government.\r\n\r\n  Aristocratic governments.\r\n\r\n  Origin and history of the word _aristocracy_.\r\n\r\n  Principle of this form of government; its consequences.\r\n\r\n  How the principle of representative government enters into\r\n  aristocratic governments.\r\n\r\n  Democratic governments.\r\n\r\n  Origin and consequences of the principle of the sovereignty of\r\n  the people.\r\n\r\n  This principle not identical with that of representative\r\n  government.\r\n\r\n  In what sense representative government is the government\r\n  of the majority.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Changes In Language And Society.\r\n\r\nI have, in my previous lecture, shown the error of those\r\nsuperficial classifications which only distinguish governments\r\naccording to their exterior characteristics; I have recognised\r\nand separated with precision between the two opposite principles,\r\nwhich are, both of them, the basis of all government; I have\r\nidentified representative government with one of these\r\nprinciples; I have proved that it could not be deduced from the\r\nother; I wish now to compare the principle of representative\r\ngovernment with the contrary principle, and to show the opposite\r\ncondition of governments which refer to it as their\r\nstarting-point. I will begin by an examination of that form of\r\ngovernment which is usually termed _aristocratic_.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Aristocratic Government.\r\n\r\nThere is a close connexion between the progressive changes that\r\nmay be observed in language and those that belong to society. The\r\nword _aristocracy_ originally signified the empire of the\r\nstrong; [Greek text], were, at first, terms applied to those who\r\nwere physically the most powerful; then they were used to\r\ndesignate the most influential, the richest, and finally the\r\nbest, those possessing the most ability or virtue. This is the\r\nhistory of the successive acceptations of the word in the\r\nlanguage from which it is borrowed; the same terms which were\r\nfirst applied to force, the superiority of force, came at length\r\nto designate moral and intellectual superiority--virtue.\r\n\r\n{66}\r\n\r\nNothing can better characterise than this the progress of\r\nsociety, which begins with the predominance of force, and tends\r\nto pass under the empire of moral and intellectual superiority.\r\nThe desire and tendency of society are in fact towards being\r\ngoverned by the best, by those who most thoroughly know and most\r\nheartily respond to the teachings of truth and justice; in this\r\nsense, all good governments, and pre-eminently the representative\r\nform of government, have for their object to draw forth from the\r\nbosom of society that veritable and legitimate aristocracy, by\r\nwhich it has a right to be governed, and which has a right to\r\ngovern it.\r\n\r\nBut such has not been the historical signification of the word\r\n_aristocracy_. If we take the word according as facts have\r\ninterpreted it, we shall find its meaning to be a government in\r\nwhich the sovereign power is placed at the disposal of a\r\nparticular class of citizens, who are hereditarily invested with\r\nit, their only qualification being a certain descent, in a manner\r\nmore or less exclusive, and sometimes almost completely\r\nexclusive.\r\n\r\nI do not inquire whence this system of government has derived its\r\norigin; how, in the infancy of society, it has sprung almost\r\ninvariably from the moral superiority of its first founders; how\r\nforce, which was originally due to moral superiority, was\r\nafterwards perpetuated by itself, and became a usurper; these\r\nquestions, which possess the highest interest, would carry me\r\naway from my main point. I am seeking for the fundamental\r\nprinciple of aristocratic government, and I believe it can be\r\nsummed up in the following terms; the right of sovereignty,\r\nattributed in a manner if not entirely exclusive, yet especially\r\nand chiefly to a certain class of citizens, whose only claim is\r\nthat of descent in a certain line.\r\n\r\nThis principle is no other than that of the sovereignty of the\r\npeople confined to a small number of individuals,--to a minority.\r\nIn both cases, the right to sovereignty is derived, not from any\r\npresumed capacity to fulfil certain conditions, nor from\r\nintellectual and moral superiority proved in any particular\r\nmanner, but from the solitary fact of birth, without any\r\ncondition. In the aristocratic system, an individual is born to a\r\nposition of sovereignty merely because he has been born into a\r\nprivileged class; according to the democratic system, an\r\nindividual is born to a position of sovereignty by the\r\ncircumstance that he is born into humanity. The participation in\r\nsovereignty is in each case the result of a purely material fact,\r\nindependent of the worth of him who possesses it, and of the\r\njudgment of those over whom it is to be exercised.\r\n{67}\r\nIt follows evidently from this, that aristocratic governments are\r\nto be classed among those which rest on the idea that the right\r\nof sovereignty exists, full and entire, somewhere on the\r\nearth;--an idea directly contrary, as we have seen, to the\r\nprinciple of representative government.\r\n\r\n\r\n            Its Consequences.\r\n\r\nIf we look at the consequences of this idea,--such consequences\r\nas have actually manifested themselves in the history of\r\ngovernments of this kind,--we shall see that they are not less\r\ncontrary to the consequences, historical as well as natural, of a\r\nrepresentative government.\r\n\r\nIn order to maintain the right of sovereignty in the class to\r\nwhich it is exclusively attributed, it must necessarily establish\r\na great inequality in fact, as well as in opinion, between this\r\nclass and the rest of the citizens. Hence arise all those\r\ninstitutions and laws which characterise aristocratic\r\ngovernments, and which have for their object to concentrate, into\r\nthe hands of the sole possessors of the sovereignty, all wealth\r\nand enlightenment, and all the various instruments of power. It\r\nis necessary that the sovereign class should not descend, and\r\nthat others should not be elevated; otherwise actual power\r\nceasing to approximate to rightful power, the legitimacy of the\r\nlatter would soon be questioned, and, after a short time, its\r\ncontinuance endangered.\r\n\r\nIn the system of those governments which attribute to no\r\nindividual upon earth a right of sovereignty, and which impose on\r\nthe existing government the necessity of seeking continually for\r\ntruth, reason, and justice, as the rule and source of rightful\r\npower, all classes of society are perpetually invited and urged\r\nto elevate and perfect themselves. Legitimate forms of supremacy\r\nare produced, and assume their position; illegitimate forms are\r\nunmasked and deposed. Factitious and violent inequalities are\r\nresisted and exhibited in their true colours; social forces are,\r\nso to speak, brought into competition, and the forces which\r\nstruggle to possess them are moral.\r\n\r\n{68}\r\n\r\nA second consequence of the principle of aristocratic governments\r\nis their avoidance of publicity. When each one of those who\r\nparticipate in the rightful sovereignty possesses it by the mere\r\naccident of birth, and exercises it on his own individual\r\nresponsibility, he need not recognise any one as claiming a right\r\nto call him to account. No one has any right to inquire into the\r\nuse which he makes of his power, for he acts in virtue of a right\r\nwhich no one can contest, because no one can deprive him of it.\r\nIt is a right which needs not to justify itself, since it is\r\nconnected with a fact that is palpable and permanent.\r\n\r\nIn the other system, on the contrary, publicity follows\r\nnecessarily from the principle of government; for since the right\r\nto power is derived from superiority in the knowledge and\r\npractice of reason, truth, and justice, which no one is supposed\r\nto possess fully and at all times, it is imperative that this\r\nright should justify itself both before it is assumed and all the\r\ntime that it is exercised.\r\n\r\n\r\n         _Conflict Of Good And Evil._\r\n\r\nIt would be easy thus, proceeding continually within view of real\r\nfacts, to compare the different consequences of the principle of\r\npurely aristocratic governments and those resulting from the\r\nprinciple of representative government, and to show that they are\r\nalways opposed to one another. We should thereby demonstrate most\r\ncompletely the opposition of the principles themselves, and bring\r\ntheir true nature into clearer light; but I have already said\r\nenough on this point. And if any one asserts that I have too\r\nrigorously insisted upon inferences to be drawn from the\r\nprinciple of aristocratic governments, that the consequences\r\nwhich I have depicted do never fulfil themselves in so complete a\r\nmanner, that, for example, the qualification of birth has never\r\nheld exclusive possession of a right to sovereignty, that never\r\nhas publicity been entirely quenched,--I freely concede all this.\r\nAt no time, in no place, has evil been allowed to gain exclusive\r\npossession of society and government; struggle between principles\r\nof good and evil is the permanent condition of the world. False\r\nideas may achieve a more or less extended, a more or less durable\r\nsuccess,--they can never extirpate their godlike assailants.\r\nTruth is patient,--it does not easily surrender its hold on\r\nsociety,--it never abandons its purpose,--it even exercises some\r\nsway over that region where error reigns most despotically.\r\nProvidence never permits bad governments to become so bad as is\r\nlogically demanded by the principle upon which they rest.\r\n{69}\r\nSo we have seen institutions of justice and liberty existing and\r\neven gaining a powerful existence, in the midst of societies\r\nruled by the principle of hereditary right; these institutions\r\nhave battled against the principle, and have modified it. When\r\nthe worse principle has prevailed, then have society and\r\ngovernment fallen into impotence and decay;--this is the history\r\nof the Venetian republic. Elsewhere, the struggle has been\r\nattended with happier results: the good principle has possessed\r\nsufficient force to be able to introduce into the government\r\nelements, which have made it vital, which have protected society\r\nagainst the effects of the evil principle, which have even in\r\nsome sort saved the evil itself, rendering it tolerable by the\r\ngood with which it is associated. This is the history of England,\r\nthat striking example of the mixture and struggle of good and\r\nevil principles. But their mixture, however intimate it may be,\r\ndoes not prove that they are confounded in their interior\r\ncharacter. Good never springs from evil; and representative\r\ngovernment has not sprung in England, any more than elsewhere,\r\nfrom the exclusive principle of aristocratic governments; it has\r\nsprung from an entirely different principle; and so far from the\r\ndistinction which I established at the commencement being\r\ncompromised by the facts to which I have alluded, it is on the\r\nother hand triumphantly confirmed by them.\r\n\r\nI have just proved, by a comparison between the principle of the\r\naristocratic and that of the democratic form of government, that\r\nthey are essentially different; I intend now to show that there\r\nis as fundamental a difference between the principle of\r\nrepresentative government, and that of democratic government.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Sovereignty Of The People.\r\n\r\nNo one has ever understood the sovereignty of the people to mean,\r\nthat after having consulted all opinions and all wills, the\r\nopinion and will of the greatest number constitutes the law, but\r\nthat the minority would be free to disobey that which had been\r\ndecided in opposition to its opinion and will. And yet this would\r\nbe the necessary consequence of the pretended right attributed to\r\neach individual of being governed only by such laws as have\r\nreceived his individual assent. The absurdity of this consequence\r\nhas not always induced its adherents to abandon the principle,\r\nbut it has always obliged them to violate it. The sovereignty of\r\nthe people is contradicted at the outset, by its being resolved\r\ninto the empire of the majority over the minority.\r\n{70}\r\nIt is almost ridiculous to say that the minority may retire from\r\nthe majority; this would be to keep society continually on the\r\nbrink of dissolution. On every question the majority and the\r\nminority would disagree, and if all the successive minorities\r\nshould retire, society would very soon exist no longer. The\r\nsovereignty of the people then must necessarily be reduced to the\r\nsovereignty of the majority only. When thus reduced, what does it\r\namount to?\r\n\r\n\r\n         Principle Of Democracy.\r\n\r\nIts principle is, that the majority possesses right by the mere\r\ncircumstance of its being the majority. But two very different\r\nideas are included in the one expression--the majority; the idea\r\nof an opinion which is accredited, and that of a force which is\r\npreponderant. So far as force is concerned, the majority\r\npossesses no right different from that possessed by force itself,\r\nwhich cannot be, upon this ground alone, the legitimate\r\nsovereignty. As to the expression of opinion, is the majority\r\ninfallible?--does it always apprehend and respect the claims of\r\nreason and justice, which alone constitute true law, and confer\r\nlegitimate sovereignty? Experience testifies to the contrary. The\r\nmajority, by mere fact of its being a majority, that is to say,\r\nby the mere force of numbers, does not then possess legitimate\r\nsovereignty, either by virtue of power, which never does confer\r\nit, nor by virtue of infallibility, which it does not possess.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the sovereignty of the people starts from the\r\nsupposition that each man possesses as his birthright, not merely\r\nan equal right of being governed, but an equal right of governing\r\nothers. Like aristocratic governments, it connects the right to\r\ngovern, not with capacity, but with birth. Aristocratic\r\ngovernment is the sovereignty of the people in the minority; the\r\nsovereignty of the people is aristocratic despotism and privilege\r\nin the hands of the majority. In both cases, the principle is the\r\nsame;--a principle contrary, in the first place, to the fact of\r\nthe inequality established by nature, between the powers and\r\ncapacities of different individuals; secondly, to the fact of the\r\ninequality in capacity, occasioned by difference of position, a\r\ndifference which exists everywhere, and which has its source in\r\nthe natural inequality of men; thirdly, to the experience of the\r\nworld, which has always seen the timid following the brave, the\r\nincompetent obeying the competent,--in one word, those who are\r\nnaturally inferior recognising and submitting themselves to their\r\nnatural superiors.\r\n{71}\r\nThe principle of the sovereignty of the people, that is to say,\r\nthe equal right of all individuals to exercise sovereignty, or\r\nmerely the right of all individuals to concur in the exercise of\r\nsovereignty, is then radically false; for, under the pretext of\r\nmaintaining legitimate equality, it violently introduces equality\r\nwhere none exists, and pays no regard to legitimate inequality.\r\nThe consequences of this principle are the despotism of number,\r\nthe domination of inferiorities over superiorities, that is, a\r\ntyranny of all others the most violent and unjust.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, it is of all others the most transient, for the\r\nprinciple is impossible of application. After its force has spent\r\nitself in excesses, number necessarily submits to capacity,--the\r\ninferior retire to make room for the superior,--these enter\r\nagain into possession of their right, and society is\r\nre-established.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Principle Of Representative Government.\r\n\r\nSuch cannot be the principle of representative government. No one\r\ndisputes that the true law of government is that of reason,\r\ntruth, and justice, which no one possesses but which certain men\r\nare more capable than others of seeking and discovering. Faithful\r\nto this aim, representative government rests upon the disposition\r\nof actual power in proportion to the capacity to act according to\r\nreason and justice, from whence power derives its right. It is\r\nthe principle which, by the admission of all, and by virtue of\r\nits simple appeal to the common sense of the community, is\r\napplicable to ordinary life, and to the interest of individuals\r\nthemselves. It is the principle which confers the sovereignty\r\nover persons, families, property, only to the individual who is\r\npresumed to be capable of using it reasonably, and which\r\nwithdraws it from him who is seen to be positively incapable.\r\nRepresentative government applies to general interests, and to\r\nthe government of society, the same principle which the good\r\nsense of the human race has led it to apply to individual\r\ninterests and to the control of each man's private life. It\r\ndistributes sovereignty according to the capacity required for\r\nit, that is to say, it only places actual power, or any portion\r\nof actual power, where it has discovered the presence of rightful\r\npower, presumed to exist by certain symptoms, or tested by\r\ncertain proofs.\r\n{72}\r\nIt is remembered, that power though legitimate is not to be\r\nconceded fully and completely to any one, and not only is it not\r\nattributed to the mere fact of birth, but it cannot be allowed to\r\nremain by itself in irresponsible isolation, which is the second\r\ncharacteristic of representative government, by which, not less\r\nthan by the preceding, it is distinguished from the sovereignty\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Government Of The Majority.\r\n\r\nIt has been often said, that representative government is the\r\ngovernment of the majority, and there is some truth in the\r\nassertion; but it must not be thought that this government of the\r\nmajority is the same as that involved in the sovereignty of the\r\npeople. The principle of the sovereignty of the people applies to\r\nall individuals, merely because they exist, without demanding of\r\nthem anything more. Thus, it takes the majority of these\r\nindividuals, and says,--Here is reason, here is law.\r\nRepresentative government proceeds in another way: it considers\r\nwhat is the kind of action to which individuals are called; it\r\nexamines into the amount of capacity requisite for this action;\r\nit then summons those individuals who are supposed to possess\r\nthis capacity, all such, and such only. Then it seeks for a\r\nmajority among those who are capable.\r\n\r\nIt is in this way, in fact, that men have everywhere proceeded,\r\neven when they have been supposed to act according to the idea of\r\nthe sovereignty of the people. Never have they been entirely\r\nfaithful to it; they have always demanded for political actions\r\ncertain conditions, that is to say, indications of a certain\r\ncapacity. They have been mistaken, more or less, and have\r\nexcluded the capable, or invited the inefficient, and the error\r\nis a serious one. But they have followed the principle which\r\nmeasures right by capacity, even when they have professed the\r\nprinciple that right is derived from the simple fact of\r\npossessing a human nature. Representative government, then, is\r\nnot purely and simply the government of the numerical majority,\r\nit is government by the majority of those who are qualified to\r\ngovern; sometimes assuming the existence of the qualification\r\nbeforehand, sometimes requiring that it should be proved and\r\nexemplified.\r\n\r\n{73}\r\n\r\n         Representation And Democracy.\r\n\r\nThe peerage, the right to elect and to be elected, the royal\r\npower itself, are attached to a capacity presumed to exist, not\r\nonly after certain conditions have been complied with, but by\r\nreason of the position occupied by those men in whom the capacity\r\nis presumed, in their relations to other powers, and in the\r\nlimits of the functions assigned to them. No one is recognised as\r\npossessing an inherent right to an office or a function. Nor is\r\nthis all; representative government does not content itself with\r\ndemanding capacity before it confers power; as soon as the\r\ncapacity is presumed or proved, it is placed in a position where\r\nit is open to a kind of legal suspicion, and where it must\r\nnecessarily continue to legitimatize itself, in order to retain\r\nits power. According to the principle of the sovereignty of the\r\npeople, absolute right resides with the majority; true\r\nsovereignty exists wherever this force is manifested; from this\r\nfollows necessarily the oppression of the minority, and such has,\r\nin fact, generally been the result. The representative form of\r\ngovernment, never forgetting that reason and justice, and\r\nconsequently a right to sovereignty, do not reside fully and\r\nconstantly in any part of the earth, presumes that they are to be\r\nfound in the majority, but does not attribute them to it as their\r\ncertain and abiding qualities. At the very moment when it\r\npresumes that the majority is right, it does not forget that it\r\nmay be wrong, and its concern is to give full opportunity to the\r\nminority of proving that it is in fact right, and of becoming in\r\nits turn the majority. Electoral precautions, the debates in the\r\ndeliberative assemblies, the publication of these debates, the\r\nliberty of the press, the responsibility of ministers, all these\r\narrangements have for their object to insure that a majority\r\nshall be declared only after it has well authenticated itself, to\r\ncompel it ever to legitimatize itself, in order to its own\r\npreservation, and to place the minority in such a position as\r\nthat it may contest the power and right of the majority.\r\n\r\nThus, the considerations we have suggested show that a\r\nrepresentative form of government regards the individuals whom it\r\nbrings into activity, and the majority which it seeks, from quite\r\nanother point of view than that involved in the sovereignty of\r\nthe people. The latter admits that the right of sovereignty\r\nresides somewhere upon the earth; the former denies it:--this\r\nfinds the right in question in a purely numerical majority; that\r\nseeks it in the majority of those qualified to pronounce on the\r\nsubject:--the one attributes it fully and entirely to number; the\r\nother is satisfied with the presumption that it is there, admits\r\nat the same time that it may possibly not be there, and invites\r\nthe minority to substantiate its claims, securing, meanwhile,\r\nevery facility for its so doing.\r\n{74}\r\nThe sovereignty of the people sees legitimate power in the\r\nmultitude; representative government sees it only in unity, that\r\nis to say, in the reason to which the multitude ought to reduce\r\nitself. The sovereignty of the people makes power to come from\r\nbelow; representative government recognises the fact that all\r\npower comes from above, and at the same time obliges all who\r\nassume to be invested with it to substantiate the legitimacy of\r\ntheir pretensions before men who are capable of appreciating\r\nthem. The one tends to lower those who are superior, the other to\r\nelevate those who are inferior, by bringing them into\r\ncommunication with those who are naturally above them. The\r\nsovereignty of the people is full at once of pride and of envy;\r\nrepresentative government renders homage to the dignity of our\r\nnature, without ignoring its frailty, and recognises its frailty\r\nwithout outrage to its dignity. The principle of the sovereignty\r\nof the people is contrary to all the facts which reveal\r\nthemselves in the actual origin of power, and in the progress of\r\nsocieties; representative government does not blink any one of\r\nthese facts. Lastly, the sovereignty of the people is no sooner\r\nproclaimed, than it is compelled to abdicate its power, and to\r\nconfess the impracticability of its aims; representative\r\ngovernment moves naturally and steadily onward, and develops\r\nitself by its very existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Principles Of Government.\r\n\r\nSo far, then, from deriving its existence from the principle of\r\nthe sovereignty of the people, representative government disowns\r\nthis principle, and rests upon an entirely different idea, and\r\none which is attended with entirely different consequences. It\r\nmatters little that this form of government has been often\r\nclaimed in the name of the sovereignty of the people, and that\r\nits principal epochs of development have occurred at times when\r\nthat idea predominated; the reasons of this fact are easily\r\ndiscovered. The sovereignty of the people is a great force which\r\nsometimes interferes to break up an inequality which has become\r\nexcessive, or a power which has become absolute, when society can\r\nno longer accommodate itself to them; as despotism sometimes\r\ninterferes, in the name of order, violently to restore a society\r\non the brink of dissolution.\r\n{75}\r\nIt is only a weapon of attack and destruction, never an\r\ninstrument for the foundation of liberty. It is not a principle\r\nof government, it is a terrible but transient dictatorship,\r\nexercised by the multitude,--a dictatorship that ceases, and that\r\nought to cease as soon as the multitude has accomplished its work\r\nof destruction.\r\n\r\nBriefly, to conclude: as the object of these lectures is to trace\r\nthe course of representative government in modern Europe wherever\r\nit has found any footing, I have looked for the primal type of\r\nthis government in order to compare it with the government of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon monarchy, which we have already examined, and with\r\nthe other primitive governments which we shall meet with in\r\nEurope. In order to distinguish precisely the character of a\r\nrepresentative government, I have been obliged to go back to the\r\nsource of all government. I think I have shown that we must\r\nclassify all governments according to two different principles.\r\nThe one class, allied to justice and reason, recognises these\r\nalone as their guides; and as it is not in the power of human\r\nfeebleness, in this world, to follow infallibly these sacred\r\nleaders, these governments do not concede to any one the\r\npossession of an absolute right to sovereignty, and they call\r\nupon the entire body of society to aid in the discovery of the\r\nlaw of justice and reason, which can alone confer it. The other\r\nclass, on the contrary, admitting a right inherent in man to make\r\na law for himself, thus degrade the rightful sovereignty; which,\r\nas it belongs only to justice and reason, ought never to come\r\nunder the absolute control of man, who is ever too ready to usurp\r\nsovereignty, in order to exercise it for the promotion of his\r\nprivate interests, or for the gratification of his passions. I\r\nhave shown that a representative government alone renders homage\r\nto true principles, and that all other governments, democratic as\r\nwell as aristocratic, ought to be arranged according to an\r\nentirely different scheme of classification. I have now to enter\r\nupon the examination of the exterior forms of representative\r\ngovernment, and to compare its principle with the historical\r\nprinciple of the Anglo-Saxon monarchy, as it is exhibited before\r\nus in its institutions.\r\n\r\n{76}\r\n\r\n                 Lecture VIII.\r\n\r\n  The forms of a government are related to its principle, but are\r\n  swayed by circumstances, and vary according to different\r\n  degrees of civilization.\r\n\r\n  What are the forms essential to a representative government?\r\n\r\n  1st. Division of powers; why this is absolutely\r\n  essential to the principle of representative government;\r\n\r\n  2nd. Election;\r\n\r\n  3rd. Publicity.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Forms Of Government.\r\n\r\nThe forms of a government are immediately related to its\r\nprinciple: the principle determines the forms, the forms reveal\r\nthe principle. It does not therefore follow that the forms\r\ncorrespond exactly to the principle, nor that the principle can\r\nonly realize itself under a peculiar form. As the principle\r\nitself is never alone nor omnipotent in its influence upon the\r\nfacts, forms are necessarily diverse and mingled. In proportion\r\nas the action of any principle extends itself, the form which is\r\ntruly correspondent to it is developed; but, in the course of\r\nthis work, the principle embodies itself in the different forms\r\nwhich correspond to the condition of those facts which, in their\r\naggregate, constitute society, and determine the position which\r\nit occupies in the scale of civilization.\r\n\r\nThe same principle can then be contained, and act under different\r\nforms. If the forms are the best that can be supplied for the\r\nprinciple, considering the existing state of society, and if,\r\nalthough they do not fully correspond to its nature, they insure\r\nthe constant and regular progress of its action,--there is no\r\nblame that can be charged upon them; each epoch, each state of\r\nsociety only allows of a certain development of the principle\r\nupon which its government rests. What is the measure of\r\ndevelopment possible to each epoch, and what is the form which\r\ncorresponds to it in the present, which will secure for the\r\nfuture a more extended development, and which will bring with it\r\nnew forms? This is the whole extent of the question I mean, the\r\nquestion concerning the present, the only one with which\r\npolitical activity has to deal.\r\n\r\n{77}\r\n\r\nNevertheless there are certain forms of government which are the\r\ngeneral conditions of the presence and action of particular\r\nprinciples. Wherever the principle exists, it necessarily\r\nproduces these forms; where they are wanting the principle does\r\nnot exist or will soon cease to exist; its action and progress\r\nimperatively demand them: so far as they gain consistency at any\r\nplace, the principle which they suppose is latently present and\r\ntends to become predominant.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Forms Of Representative Government.\r\n\r\nWhat are the essential forms of the principle of representative\r\ngovernment? By what external indications may we recognize the\r\npresence of this principle in a government? What conditions are\r\nrequired in order that it may act and develop itself?\r\n\r\nWe may, if I mistake not, reduce to three the conditions\r\nnecessary, and the forms essential, to the representative system;\r\nall three are perhaps not equally necessary; their simultaneous\r\nexistence is not perhaps indispensable in order to indicate the\r\nexistence and secure the development of the principle from which\r\nthey are derived. We may, however, justly consider them as\r\nfundamental. These forms are: 1st. The division of powers; 2nd.\r\nElection; 3rd. Publicity.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that no really existing power can be a rightful\r\npower, except in so far as it acts according to reason and truth,\r\nthe only legitimate rule of action, the only source of right.\r\n\r\nNo existing power can fully know and constantly regard the\r\nguidance of reason and truth according to which it is bound to\r\nregulate its action. No actual power then is, or can be, in\r\nitself, a power by inherent right. In other words, as no existing\r\npower can be found that is infallible, there is none that may\r\nretain its existence on the tenure of absolute right.\r\n\r\nSuch is, however, the condition of human things that they need,\r\nas a last appeal, the intervention of a power which may declare\r\nthe law to be the rule of government, and which shall impose it\r\nand cause it to be respected. In all the relations which the\r\nsocial state admits and to which it gives birth, from domestic\r\norder to political order, the presence of a power which may give\r\nand maintain the rule of action, is a necessary condition of the\r\nvery existence of society.\r\n\r\n{78}\r\n\r\nWe see then the dilemma in which society is placed. No actual\r\npower can vindicate a claim to become an absolute power; hence\r\nthe necessity, in order to meet particular emergencies, of a\r\npower that is definite, that is to say, _actually_ absolute.\r\n\r\n\r\n          Problem Of Government.\r\n\r\nThe problem of government is--how to give society a guarantee\r\nthat the power, which is in operation absolute, to which all\r\nsocial relations must necessarily be referred, shall be but the\r\nimage, the expression, the organ of that power which is\r\nrightfully absolute and alone legitimate, and which is never to\r\nbe found localized in this world? This is also, as we have seen,\r\nthe problem which the representative system formally proposes to\r\nitself, since all its arrangements assume the existence of this\r\nproblem and are framed with a purpose to resolve it.\r\n\r\nTo make actual power, as far as possible, identical with rightful\r\npower, by imposing upon it the abiding necessity of seeking for\r\nreason, truth, and justice--the sources of right; by investing it\r\nwith practical power only when it has proved, that is to say,\r\ngiven a presumption of, its success in this search; and by\r\ncompelling it ever to renew and confirm this presumption under\r\npenalty of losing power if it is unable to do so, this is the\r\ncourse of the representative system,--this is the end at which it\r\naims and according to which it directs, in their relations and\r\ntheir movement, all the resources which it brings into action.\r\n\r\nIn order to attain this end, it is indispensable that the\r\nexisting power should not be simple, that is to say, that it\r\nshould not be suffered to confine itself to one single\r\ninstrument. As no force can possess in itself fully the right to\r\nauthority, if there is one which possesses an absolute power, not\r\nonly will it abuse this power, but it will very soon claim it as\r\nan inherent right. Alone it will become despotic, and in order to\r\nsustain its despotism it will call itself legitimately sovereign;\r\nand perhaps will end by believing and establishing the fiction.\r\nSuch is the corrupting effect of despotism, that it destroys\r\nsooner or later, both in those who exercise it and in those who\r\nsubmit to it, even the feeling of its illegitimacy. Whoever is\r\nsolitary in his sovereignty has only one step in order to become\r\naccredited, as infallible.\r\n{79}\r\nAlexander was right in wishing that he should be recognized as a\r\ngod; he deduced a consequence that strictly followed from the\r\nfulness of the power which he possessed: and they also are right,\r\nwho, attributing sovereignty to the multitude, take for their\r\nmaxim, _Vox populi, vox Dei_. Everywhere where sovereignty\r\nrests with a single power, whatever may be the nature of that\r\npower, there is a danger that sovereignty will immediately be\r\nclaimed as a right.\r\n\r\n\r\n            Division Of Powers.\r\n\r\nA division of the actual sovereignty is then a natural\r\nconsequence of the principle, that a right to sovereignty does\r\nnot belong to any person. It is necessary that there should be\r\nseveral powers, equal in extent and supplementary to each other\r\nin the exercise of actual sovereignty, in order that no one of\r\nthem may be led to arrogate to itself the sovereignty of inherent\r\nright. The feeling of their reciprocal interdependence can alone\r\nprevent them from regarding themselves as entirely irresponsible.\r\n\r\nFurther: it is only in this way that the ruling power can be\r\nconstrained to perpetuate its search for reason, truth, and\r\njustice; that is, for the rule which should govern its action, in\r\norder that it may become legitimate. The words of Pascal apply\r\nnot only to the formation of power, they extend also to its\r\nexercise. Here are beings, individual or collective, who are\r\ncalled upon to perform the functions of sovereignty in common,\r\neach one under the supervision of his fellows. Do they possess\r\namong them, or by the fact of their existence, the right to\r\npower? No: they must seek it, they must on every opportunity\r\nmanifest the truth which they proclaim as law. Isolated and\r\ndistinct, they are only a multitude; when, after having\r\ndeliberated and laboured, they find a ground of agreement in a\r\ncommon idea, from whence can proceed one will, then alone will\r\nthe true unity, which resides in reason, be evolved; then there\r\nwill be a presumption that the ruling power knows accurately and\r\nis well disposed to that legitimate rule which alone confers\r\nrightful power. If this work were not enforced, if this laborious\r\nand common search for the true law were not the necessary result\r\nof the reciprocal independence of the several powers, the end of\r\ngovernment would not be attained. All the relations of the four\r\ngreat political powers which constitute, with us, the government\r\n(that is, the king, the two houses of parliament, and the\r\nelectors) are intended to compel them to act in harmony, that is\r\nto say, to reduce themselves to unity.\r\n\r\n{80}\r\n\r\n         Election And Publicity.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of an elective, that is, a moveable element,\r\ninto government, is as necessary as a division of forces to\r\nprevent the sovereignty from degenerating in the hands of those\r\nwho exercise it into a full and permanent sovereignty of inherent\r\nright. It is therefore the necessary result of a representative\r\ngovernment, and one of its principal characteristics. Accordingly\r\nwe see that actual governments which have aimed at becoming\r\nabsolute, have always endeavoured to destroy the elective\r\nprinciple. Venice gave a memorable illustration of this tendency,\r\nwhen, in 1319, it conferred an hereditary right on the grand\r\ncouncil. [Footnote 11]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 11: This event is clearly and minutely related by\r\n    Daru, in his \"_Histoire de Venise_\" (Vol. i. pp.\r\n    449-464.)]\r\n\r\nIn the first age of governments, at the same time that we see\r\npower come from, above, that is to say, acquire for itself by its\r\nsuperiority, of whatever kind that may be, either ability,\r\nriches, or courage,--we see it also obliged to make its title\r\nrecognised by those who can judge it. Election is the mode of\r\nthis recognition,--it is to be found in the infancy of all\r\ngovernments; but it is generally abolished after a time. It is\r\nwhen it reappears with sufficient energy to influence powerfully\r\nthe administration of society, that a representative government\r\nis rising into being.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, publicity is perhaps the most essential\r\ncharacteristic of a representative government. We have seen that\r\nit has for its object to call upon all individuals who possess\r\nrights, as well as those who exercise powers, to seek reason and\r\njustice, the source and rule of legitimate sovereignty. In\r\npublicity consists the bond between a society and its government.\r\nLooking, however, at facts, we find that of the elements\r\nessential to a representative government, this is the last which\r\nis introduced and gains a firm footing. Its history is analogous\r\nto that of the elective principle. The _Champs de Mars_ and\r\n_Mai_ were held in the open air: many persons were present\r\nat them who took no part in the deliberation. The assembly of the\r\nLombards at Pavia took place _circumstante immensâ\r\nmultitudine_. It is probable that the same publicity attended\r\nalso the _Wittenagemot_ of the Saxons.\r\n\r\n{81}\r\n\r\n            Publicity In England.\r\n\r\nWhen absolute or aristocratic government prevails, publicity\r\ndisappears. When representative government begins to be formed by\r\nelection, publicity does not at first enter into its\r\nconstitution. In England, the House of Commons was for a long\r\ntime a secret assembly; the first step towards publicity was to\r\ncause its acts, addresses and resolutions, to be printed. This\r\nstep was taken by the Long Parliament under Charles I. Under\r\nCharles II. its proceedings again became secret; some individuals\r\ndemanded, but in vain, the publication of the acts passed by the\r\nHouse,--the demand was resisted as dangerous. It was not till\r\nthe eighteenth century that visitors were allowed to be present\r\nat the sittings of the English Parliament: this is not now\r\ngranted as a right, and the demand of a single member who appeals\r\nto the ancient law, is sufficient to clear the gallery. Publicity\r\nhas not then been invariably attached to a representative\r\ngovernment; but it flows naturally from its principles--it is\r\naccordingly won almost necessarily, and may now be regarded as\r\none of its most essential features. This result is owing to the\r\npress, which has rendered publicity easy without resorting to\r\ntumultuous meetings.\r\n\r\nWe have found the fundamental principle and the exterior and\r\nessential characteristics of a representative government; we have\r\nlearnt what it is that constitutes it and distinguishes it from\r\nother governments: we may now pass to its history. We shall take\r\ncare to admit its existence only where we recognise the presence\r\nor the approach of its true principles; and we shall be convinced\r\nthat its progress has ever been identical with the development of\r\nthese principles.\r\n\r\n{82}\r\n\r\n              Lecture IX.\r\n\r\n  Primitive institutions of the Franks.\r\n\r\n  Sketch of the history of the Frankish monarchy.\r\n\r\n  The Franks in Germany.\r\n\r\n  Their settlement in Belgium and in Gaul.\r\n\r\n  Character and authority of their chiefs after their\r\n  establishment in the Roman Empire.\r\n\r\n  Early Frankish chieftains.\r\n\r\n  Clovis: his expeditions, wars, and conquests.\r\n\r\n  Decisive preponderance of the Franks in Gaul.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Origin Of The Franks.\r\n\r\nIn order to pursue the object of this course, I now proceed to\r\ngive a sketch of the Franks similar to that which I have already\r\ngiven of the Anglo-Saxons. I shall study with you their primitive\r\ninstitutions, seek out their leading principle, and compare it\r\nwith that type of representative government which we have just\r\ndelineated. But before we enter upon the examination of Frankish\r\ninstitutions, I think it advisable briefly to refer to the\r\nleading events in the history of France. The institutions of a\r\npeople cannot be thoroughly understood without a knowledge of\r\ntheir history. I shall devote this lecture to a view of the\r\nestablishment of the Frankish monarchy; on a future occasion we\r\nwill trace its progress under the first and second races of its\r\nkings.\r\n\r\nI shall not now delay to discuss the somewhat uncertain origin of\r\nthe Franks; there is reason to believe that, in Germany, they did\r\nnot constitute a separate and homogeneous nation. They were a\r\nconfederation of tribes settled in the country between the Rhine,\r\nthe Maine, the Weser, and the Elbe. The Romans seem to have been\r\nlong ignorant of their existence even after the conquest of Gaul,\r\nand history mentions them, for the first time, during the reign\r\nof Gordian, about the middle of the third century. A song,\r\ncomposed in celebration of the victories of Aurelian had the\r\nfollowing refrain:--\r\n\r\n  \"Mille Francos, mille Sarmatas,\r\n  Semel et semel occidimus.\"\r\n\r\n{83}\r\n\r\nAfter this period, we find the different tribes of Franks\r\nadvancing from East to West with rather rapid progress. At the\r\nbeginning of the fourth century, we meet with the Salian Franks\r\nsettled in Belgium, and the Ripuarian Franks on the two banks of\r\nthe Rhine. These peoples established themselves on the frontiers\r\nof Gaul, sometimes by force, and sometimes with the consent of\r\nthe emperors, who, after having defeated the barbarians,\r\nfrequently assigned them lands on which to settle. This was the\r\ncourse pursued by Probus, Constantine, Julian, Constantius, and\r\nmany others.\r\n\r\n\r\n         The Frankish Chiefs.\r\n\r\nThe chiefs thus established in the Roman territory retained, over\r\ntheir barbarian comrades, their ancient and independent\r\nauthority, and received at the same time, from the emperors,\r\ncertain titles to which were applied certain functions, and a\r\ncertain amount of authority over the Romans in their district.\r\nThus we find them adorned with the names of _Dux, Magister\r\nmilitia, Comes littoris_, and so forth. Their position was\r\nalmost identical with that of the leaders of the wandering Tartar\r\ntribes in the Russian empire, who are elected by the men of their\r\ntribe, but receive their title and a certain jurisdiction from\r\nthe Emperor of Russia--retaining their independent life, but\r\nbound at the same time to render military service, and to pay a\r\ntribute of furs.\r\n\r\nChilderic, the chief of a Frankish tribe at Tournai, had received\r\nthe title of _Magister militiæ_ from the empire. When, in\r\nconsequence of domestic quarrels and treason, he was forced to\r\ntake refuge in Thuringia, his tribe submitted in 460 to Egidius,\r\nmaster of the Roman militia at Soissons. In 1653, the tomb of\r\nChilderic was discovered at Tournai, and several pieces of money\r\nwere found in it, which are now deposited in the National\r\nLibrary, at Paris.\r\n\r\nAt the termination of the fifth century, the epoch of the\r\ndissolution of the empire, when the provinces were left,\r\naccording to the expression of Tacitus, _magis sine domino quam\r\ncum libertate_, nearly all these local chieftains, Romans as\r\nwell as barbarians, became independent, and no longer recognised\r\nthe sovereignty of Rome. Siagrius, the son of Egidius, was\r\nappointed King of the Romans at Soissons. He made war with\r\nClovis, in his own name and on his own account.\r\n\r\n{84}\r\n\r\nThe Frankish chiefs, who had thus become petty sovereigns,\r\npenetrated still farther into the empire. Clodion, who had\r\nsettled at Cambrai, carried his incursions to the banks of the\r\nSomme. Meroveus was present at the battle of Chalons-sur-Marne,\r\nat which Attila was conquered.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Wars Of Clovis.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, under the command of their chieftain Clovis,\r\nthat these bands of Franks, who originally formed colonies on the\r\nfrontiers, entered Gaul definitively as conquerors. Clovis was\r\nthe son of Childeric, who reigned at Tournai; and he succeeded\r\nhis father in 481. He probably wielded a certain amount of\r\nauthority in the name of the empire. Saint Remy, in a letter,\r\ngives him the title of _Magister militiæ_. Other Frankish\r\nchiefs were, about this period, almost in the same position as\r\nClovis: Ragnachar ruled at Cambrai, Sigebert at Cologne, and\r\nRenomer at Mans. Clovis was the most ambitious, the ablest, and\r\nthe most fortunate of them all.\r\n\r\nHis nearest neighbour was Siagrius, who governed at Soissons. In\r\n486, Clovis sent him a defiance; Siagrius accepted it, and\r\nappointed the battle-field at Nogent, near Soissons. Siagrius was\r\nconquered, and took refuge with Alaric, king of the Visigoths,\r\nwho gave him up to his conqueror. In 491, Clovis conquered the\r\ndistrict of Tongres, now the district of Liege. In 496, he\r\npenetrated still further in the same direction; he entered the\r\ncountry of the Alemanni, against whom Sigebert, king of Cologne,\r\nhad requested his assistance. He defeated them at Tolbiac, and\r\nbecame a Christian in consequence of this victory. A party of the\r\nconquered Alemanni took refuge in Rhœtia, under the protection of\r\nTheodoric, king of the Ostrogoths: there, under the name of\r\nSuevi, they became the stem of the Suabians. Another body\r\nremained on the banks of the Rhine, and became subject to\r\nSigebert and Clovis. Thus this chieftain extended his dominion in\r\nthe vicinity of the Rhine. At the same time he overcame most of\r\nthe Frankish chiefs, his neighbours, and subjected their tribes\r\nto his power. In 497, he led an expedition against the Armoricans\r\nin the West. In 500, he fell upon the Burgundians in the East,\r\ntook advantage of their dissensions, and gained a victory between\r\nDijon, and Langres. In 507, he advanced into the centre of\r\nFrance, through Anjou and Poitou; near Poitiers, he attacked\r\nAlaric II., king of the Visigoths, and killed him. He penetrated\r\nas far as Angoulême, Bordeaux, and Toulouse; and boasted of\r\nhaving conquered Aquitaine. In 508, Clovis received the title of\r\n_Patrician_ from Anastasius, the Emperor of the East. In\r\n509, he returned to the Rhine, defeated his ancient ally,\r\nSigebert, king of Cologne, and subjugated the Ripuarian Franks.\r\nIn 511, he died, after having led his Frankish warriors, and\r\nextended his dominion, over the various parts of Gaul.\r\n\r\n{85}\r\n\r\nThe wars and conquests of Clovis had little resemblance to what\r\nwe understand by the same words at the present day. The principal\r\nobject of the Frankish expeditions was to make booty, and carry\r\noff slaves; this is what was called conquest in those days. The\r\nvictor sometimes imposed a tribute; but there resulted from his\r\nvictory hardly any permanent possession, and no civil settlement.\r\nAmong other proofs of this assertion, I may instance the small\r\nnumber of the warriors who accompanied Clovis, who was never\r\nattended, on his expeditions, by more than five or six thousand\r\nmen. Now, with this number, no civil settlement, not even a\r\nmilitary occupation, was possible. When the conqueror had\r\nwithdrawn, the conquered people gradually resumed their\r\nindependence--a new chieftain arose. Barely did the conquerors\r\nsettle in the lands which they had subjected; thus it was\r\nnecessary incessantly to make the same conquests over again.\r\n\r\nFor a detailed narrative of these events, I refer you to the\r\ngeneral histories of France, especially to the work of M.\r\nSismondi.\r\n\r\nNowhere do we obtain a better picture of the manners of the\r\nGreeks in the heroic age than that supplied by the Iliad. A\r\nsimilar authority, with reference to the expeditions and manners\r\nof the Germanic people, exists in the poem of the Nibelungen.\r\nThere you will best be able to obtain a correct knowledge and\r\nthorough comprehension of the state of society, and the nature of\r\nthe wars at this epoch.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Death Of Clovis.\r\n\r\nAt the death of Clovis, in 571, the Frankish monarchy was\r\ndefinitively established; for he had made the Frankish name and\r\npeople the most formidable and least contested power in Gaul.\r\n\r\n{86}\r\n\r\n              Lecture X.\r\n\r\n  Division of territory among the sons of the Frankish kings.\r\n\r\n  Rapid formation and disappearance of several Frank kingdoms.\r\n\r\n  Neustria and Austrasia; their geographical division.\r\n\r\n  Early predominance of Neustria.\r\n\r\n  Fredegonde and Brunehaut.\r\n\r\n  Elevation of the _Mayors of the Palace_.\r\n\r\n  True character of their power.\r\n\r\n  The Pepin family.\r\n\r\n  Charles Martel.\r\n\r\n  Fall of the Merovingians.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Successors Of Clovis.\r\n\r\nI have already explained to you how we must understand the\r\nhistorical phrase which attributes to Clovis the foundation of\r\nthe French monarchy. In the sense and within the limits which I\r\nhave indicated, Clovis, at his death, was king of the whole of\r\nFrance, excepting the kingdoms of the Burgundians and Visigoths.\r\nAfter his decease, each of his four sons received a portion of\r\nhis dominions. Theodoric ruled at Metz, Chlodomir at Orleans,\r\nChildebert at Paris, and Clotaire at Soissons. The nature of this\r\ndivision has given rise to considerable dissension among learned\r\nmen; but I think the question may be easily solved. In order to\r\nretain his power, it was necessary for the chieftain or king to\r\npossess large private domains; in all his warlike expeditions, he\r\nacquired for himself large tracts of territory; Clovis had thus\r\nobtained immense landed property wherever he had made a conquest.\r\nAt his death, these estates were divided among his children, as\r\nwere also his other possessions, flocks, herds, jewels, money,\r\ntreasures of all kinds: these supplied their owners with the\r\nsurest means of attaining power. Moreover, it was the custom of\r\nthe Frankish kings to associate their sons with them in the\r\ngovernment, by sending them to reside in that district or\r\nprovince which was afterwards to constitute their kingdom. They\r\nthus endeavoured to secure the prevalence of hereditary right\r\nover election. The sons of the king became in their turn the\r\nnatural chieftains of the countries in which they actually\r\npossessed the most power. Thus we find that Clotaire II., in 622,\r\nassociated with himself his son Dagobert, and sent him to\r\nAustrasia. Dagobert did the same, in 633, for his son Sigebert.\r\n\r\n{87}\r\n\r\n         Partitions Of The Realm.\r\n\r\nFrom this division of private domains and participation in royal\r\npower, it was easy to pass to the political partition of the\r\nkingdom. It is more difficult to discover whether these\r\npartitions were made by the dying king, in his own authority, or\r\nby the national assembly. At a later period, under the second\r\nrace, we find Pepin, Charlemagne and Louis the Debonnair,\r\npositively obtaining the consent of the assembly of barons to the\r\ndivision of their states among their children. Pacts are not so\r\nclear and authentic under the Merovingians. However, as the\r\naccession of the second race was a return to old Germanic\r\nmanners, it is probable that, in the time of Clovis and his\r\nsuccessors, every heir, on receiving his portion, was obliged to\r\ngain the consent of the chiefs of the country. Five partitions of\r\nthis kind occurred under the Merovingians; in 511, after the\r\ndeath of Clovis; in 561, after Clotaire I.; in 638, after\r\nDagobert I.; in 656, after Clovis II. Prom 678 to 752, the whole\r\nmonarchy was actually united under the authority of the Pepin\r\nfamily, who were originally _Mayors of the Palace_ of\r\nAustrasia, and nominally under that of titular kings, the first\r\nfour and the sixth of whom descended from the kings of Neustria,\r\nand the fifth and seventh from those of Austrasia. The kingdoms\r\nwhich were constituted by the five partitions which I have just\r\nmentioned, were those of Metz, Orleans, Paris, Soissons,\r\nAustrasia, Burgundy, Neustria, and Aquitaine.\r\n\r\nI shall not here speak of the vicissitudes and perpetual\r\ndismemberments of these various kingdoms at various times. I\r\nshould have only to relate a long series of wars and murders. The\r\nancient kingdom of Burgundy was conquered by the children of\r\nClovis I.; a new kingdom of Burgundy arose, in which the kingdom\r\nof Orleans was incorporated. The new kingdom of Burgundy was\r\ninvaded, sometimes by the kings of Neustria, sometimes by those\r\nof Austrasia. The kingdom of Aquitaine appears for a moment only\r\nunder Childebert II., son of Clotaire II., in 628, and about 716,\r\nunder Eudes, duke of Aquitaine, who declared himself an\r\nindependent monarch. At length, these four kingdoms disappeared;\r\nthe fundamental conflict and division was between the kingdoms of\r\nNeustria and Austrasia, the two largest, and last surviving.\r\n\r\n{88}\r\n         Neustria And Austrasia.\r\n\r\nThe geographical division of the kingdoms of Neustria and\r\nAustrasia is uncertain and variable. We find the kings of\r\nAustrasia possessing countries far distant from the centre of\r\ntheir government--countries, too, which seem to be naturally\r\nplaced by their position under the sway of the kings of Neustria.\r\nThus, they were the masters of Auvergne, and their dominion\r\nextended almost as far as Poitou. These incoherent possessions\r\nhad their origin in the frequent expeditions of the two countries\r\nagainst each other, or into distant lands which belonged to\r\nneither of them. We can, however, obtain some few distinct\r\nboundary lines; the forest of Ardennes separated Austrasia from\r\nNeustria; Neustria comprised the country between the Meuse and\r\nthe Loire; Austrasia consisted of that between the Meuse and the\r\nRhine.\r\n\r\nThis division had a far greater importance than that of a mere\r\ngeographical division; and there is a deeper cause for the\r\nsuccessive disappearance of the other Frankish kingdoms, and the\r\nfinal predominance of these two.\r\n\r\nThe countries which composed Austrasia were the first which were\r\ninhabited by the Franks. They adjoined Germany, and were\r\nconnected with those portions of the Frankish confederacy which\r\nhad not crossed the Rhine. They were, therefore, the cradle, the\r\nfirst fatherland, of the Franks. Moreover, after their\r\nexpeditions, these tribes frequently returned with their booty to\r\ntheir ancient settlement, instead of establishing themselves in\r\ntheir new conquests. Thus Theodoric, son of Clovis, in the fifth\r\ncentury, led a great expedition into Auvergne, and returned\r\nafterwards to Austrasia. Roman civilization and manners had been\r\nalmost completely expelled from that bank of the Rhine; the\r\nancient German manners predominated there. In the countries which\r\ncomposed Neustria, on the other hand, the Franks were less\r\nnumerous, more scattered, more separated from their ancient\r\nfatherland and fellow-countrymen. The ancient inhabitants of the\r\ncountry surrounded them on every side. The Franks were there like\r\ncolonies of barbarians transported into the midst of Roman\r\ncivilization and a Roman people. This state of things could not\r\nbut lead to a far more profound and reasonable distinction\r\nbetween the two kingdoms, than could be occasioned by a purely\r\ngeographical division. On one side was the kingdom of the\r\nGermano-Franks, on the other that of the Romano-Franks.\r\n\r\n{89}\r\n\r\n          Predominance Of Neustria.\r\n\r\nHistoric testimony positively confirms this probable deduction\r\nfrom facts. Austrasia is termed _Francia Teutonica_, and\r\nNeustria, _Francia Romana_. The German language prevailed in\r\nthe former country, and the Roman in the latter. Finally, under\r\nthe first race of kings, events bear the evident impress of this\r\nfundamental distinction, or rather, they are its natural result.\r\nWhen considering them in a general manner, it is impossible to\r\nrecognize this character. I shall now give a summary of the\r\nprincipal proofs.\r\n\r\nI. The original predominance of the kingdom of Neustria. This is\r\nan incontestable fact. Four kings, after Clovis, and before the\r\ndestruction of the royal authority by the Mayors of the Palace,\r\nunited the whole Frankish monarchy under one head. These were\r\nkings of Neustria; Clotaire I., from 558 to 561; Clotaire II.,\r\nfrom 613 to 628; Dagobert I., from 631 to 638; and Clovis II.,\r\nfrom 655 to 656. This predominance of Neustria was the natural\r\nresult, 1st, Of the establishment of Clovis in Neustria; 2ndly,\r\nOf the central position of that kingdom with reference to the\r\nrest of Gaul; 3rd, Of the superior civilization and wealth which\r\naccrued to it from its Roman population; 4th, Of the rapid\r\nextension which the royal authority obtained in it, in\r\nconsequence of the prevalence of Roman ideas and customs; 5th, Of\r\nthe continual fluctuations occasioned in Austrasia, by the\r\nproximity of the German barbarians, by wars against the\r\nThuringians and Saxons, and by other causes.\r\n\r\nII. The state of the two kingdoms, during the epoch of Fredegonde\r\nand Brunehaut, from 598 to 623. The struggle was constant between\r\nNeustria and Austrasia, under the name of these two queens. The\r\npower of Chilperic and of Fredegonde in Neustria was greater than\r\nthat of the kings of Austrasia and of Brunehaut. Fredegonde acted\r\nupon a country in which the only Roman administration still\r\nprevailed; Brunehaut endeavoured in vain to overcome the rude\r\nindependence of the chiefs of the German bands, who had become\r\nlarge landed proprietors. Her boldness and ability failed in its\r\nopposition to the Austrasian and Burgundian aristocracy.\r\n{90}\r\nThe Austrasian aristocracy formed a secret alliance with that of\r\nNeustria. The fall and death of Brunehaut were evidently a\r\ntriumph of the Austrasian aristocracy, which, being stronger and\r\nmore compact than that of Neustria, imposed upon Clotaire II. the\r\nexecution of his queen. The remnants of Roman despotism were\r\novercome in Austrasia by the German aristocracy, and the\r\nconsequences of that event were the enfeeblement of the royal\r\nauthority and the predominance of Austrasian influence.\r\n\r\n\r\n         The Mayors Of The Palace.\r\n\r\nIII. The elevation of the Mayors of the Palace, and the fall of\r\nthe Merovingian race, are the third proof of the great fact which\r\nI have mentioned. The elevation of the Mayors of the Palace must\r\nbe ascribed to the same causes in both kingdoms. It is an error\r\nto interpret this fact as the conflict of the victorious Franks\r\nagainst the Gauls and Romans. These last, more moulded to\r\ndespotism, had found a ready access to the court of the barbarian\r\nkings, and it has been inferred from this, that it was in order\r\nto counteract their influence, that the German aristocracy\r\ncreated the Mayors of the Palace. This is an error; the Mayors of\r\nthe Palace were the work and instrument of the barbarian\r\naristocracy, whether Roman or Gallic, in opposition to the royal\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nIt has also been said that the kings were desirous of attaching\r\nto themselves one of the most powerful members of the territorial\r\naristocracy, in order to control or oppress the others. This\r\nmight have been the case originally, but the Mayor of the Palace\r\nsoon found it more advantageous to make himself the leader and\r\ninstrument of the nobility. He promoted their interests, and\r\nassumed the character of a protector to the large proprietors\r\nwith whom, finally, his appointment rested. From this time forth,\r\nthe royal authority was almost a dead letter.\r\n\r\nThe same phenomenon is observable in both kingdoms; but the\r\nAustrasian aristocracy was more purely German, and more compact,\r\nthan that of Neustria. It was consequently more powerful, and its\r\nMayors of the Palace became more deeply rooted in their\r\nauthority. Thus we behold the family of Pepin gain the royal\r\npower by a progressive elevation, from 630 to 752. This family\r\nwas descended from Carloman, the wealthy proprietor of the domain\r\nof Haspengau, situated on the Meuse, between the district of\r\nLiege and the duchy of Brabant. It was thoroughly German, and\r\nnaturally placed itself at the head of the Franco-German\r\naristocracy.\r\n\r\n{91}\r\n\r\n         Fall Of The Merovingians.\r\n\r\nThe fall of the Merovingians was, therefore, the work of\r\nAustrasia, and, as it were, a second conquest of Roman France, by\r\nGermanic France. The kings of Roman France were unable to\r\nmaintain their position, and the Neustrian Mayors of the Palace,\r\nthe leaders of a mingled aristocracy of Franks and Gauls, were\r\nincompetent to take their place. It was from the banks of the\r\nRhine and from Belgium, that is, from the ancient fatherland of\r\nthe Franks, that the new conquerors came--and these conquerors\r\nwere the chiefs of a purely Germanic aristocracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Charles Martel.\r\n\r\nThis was, undoubtedly, the true character of the fall of the\r\nMerovingians, and of the elevation of the Carlovingians, who\r\nfounded a new Frankish monarchy in that Gaul in which the\r\nNeustrian Franks had so greatly degenerated. Thus we shall\r\nperceive, at this epoch, and in consequence of this revolution, a\r\nmarked return towards the primitive institutions and manners of\r\nthe Franks. This is perceptible, indeed, even in the manner in\r\nwhich the revolution was effected. The details of this event\r\nfully confirm what we have first said regarding the general\r\nprogress of affairs. The Pepin family had laboured for a century\r\nto place itself at the head of the Frankish nation. It derived\r\nits support not merely from the great landed aristocracy, but\r\nalso from the patronage of the warriors employed in military\r\nexpeditions. The development of the power of this family, in the\r\nfirst point of view, was the work of Pepin the Old and of Pepin\r\nde Heristal; under the second, it was the work of Charles Martel\r\nin particular. His continual wars against the Transrhenane\r\nGermans, against the Saracens, and against the petty tyrants of\r\nthe interior, rendered him a more powerful warrior-chief than any\r\nof his ancestors. But Charles Martel employed other means also to\r\nattach his companions to his person. He seized the property of\r\nthe church, and distributed it amongst them. He did not take this\r\nproperty, however, in so absolute a manner as is supposed. The\r\nvarious churches were in the habit of farming out their property\r\nfor a fixed annual income, and ecclesiastical estates thus farmed\r\nout were called _precaria_.\r\n{92}\r\nFrequently the kings, when desirous of rewarding one of their\r\nchiefs, ordered a chapter to farm out an estate to the favourite\r\nfor a very moderate rent, under the title of a _precarium_.\r\nCharles Martel, at first, merely generalised this practice. A\r\nvery large number of his comrades received from him favours of\r\nthis kind; in the first instance, they received the\r\necclesiastical estates only for two or three years; but, when\r\nthat term had expired, the tenants were unwilling to restore what\r\nthey had appropriated to themselves by the habit of enjoyment.\r\nThe conflict of the church against the usurping proprietors long\r\nperplexed the the kings of the second race. As they often\r\nrequired the help of the clergy, they strove to appease their\r\ncomplaints. Pepin the Short and Charlemagne restored to them a\r\nlarge portion of their property which had formerly been granted\r\nto their warriors as _precaria_; or at least, increased the\r\namount paid to the church by the new proprietors, who obstinately\r\nrefused to consider themselves mere tenants.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Pepin.\r\n\r\nThe predominance of the Pepin family had commenced before the\r\ntime of Charles Martel, by their possessing the hereditary office\r\nof Mayor of the Palace. During the life of that great chieftain,\r\nthere were several inter-reigns in Austrasia and Neustria, and he\r\ncontinued to exercise the supreme authority with the simple title\r\nof Duke of the Franks. At his death, his children, Pepin and\r\nCarloman, divided the kingdom between them, Pepin, still\r\npreserving some respect for appearances, made Childeric III. king\r\nin Neustria; and soon, by the abdication of his brother Carloman,\r\nhe found himself Duke of Austrasia, as well as the all-powerful\r\nMayor of the Palace in Neustria. Such was, however, the influence\r\nalready possessed by the idea of the hereditary legitimacy of the\r\ncrown, that Pepin did not venture to seize, in the name of force\r\nalone, upon the throne which was considered to belong rightfully\r\nto the descendants of Clovis. He sought to justify his employment\r\nof force by popular election, and an appeal to religion. As the\r\nhead of an aristocracy, he was obliged frequently to defer to its\r\nwill, and to give it a share of authority. He revived the ancient\r\nassemblies of the large landowners, and restored to them their\r\npart in public affairs.\r\n{93}\r\nThenceforward he might consider himself certain of his election;\r\nbut even this did not suffice him. He thought that his usurpation\r\nneeded a more august and sacred sanction. He gained over to his\r\ninterests Boniface, bishop of Mayence, and charged him to sound\r\nPope Zachary, who, on his side, was hard pressed by the Lombards,\r\nand needed the assistance of the Frankish chieftain. When Pepin\r\nwas sure of the pontiff's concurrence, he sent Burckhardt, bishop\r\nof Wurtzburg, and Fulrad, abbot of St. Denis, to propose to him\r\nthis question, in the form of a case of conscience. \"When there\r\nis a king in fact and a king by right, which is the true king?\"\r\nThe pope replied, that he who actually exercised the royal\r\nauthority ought also to possess the royal title. In 752, Pepin\r\nconvoked the national assembly at Soissons; he was there elected\r\nking, and afterwards consecrated by Bishop Boniface. In 754, Pope\r\nStephen III. made a journey into France, and again consecrated\r\nPepin with his two sons and his wife Bertrade. The pope ordered\r\nthe Franks, on pain of excommunication, to take none as kings who\r\ndid not belong to the family of Pepin, and the Franks swore an\r\noath: _Ut nunquam de alterius lumbis regem in ævo præsumant\r\neligere_.\r\n\r\nA second dynasty was thus established almost in the same manner\r\nas the first had been. The principal warrior-chief, the most\r\npowerful of the large landowners, has himself elected by his\r\ncompanions, confines future elections to members of his own\r\nfamily, and obtains the sanction of religion to his election. He\r\nholds the actual power from his fathers and from himself; he is\r\ndesirous of holding the rightful power from God and from the\r\npeople. German manners and institutions reappear, but in\r\nassociation with Christian ideas. Here is a second conquest of\r\nGaul, accomplished by German warriors, and sanctioned, in the\r\nname of the Roman world, no longer by the Emperor, but by the\r\nPope. The church has inherited the moral ascendancy of the\r\nempire.\r\n\r\n{94}\r\n\r\n              Lecture XI.\r\n\r\n  General character of events under the Carlovingian Empire.\r\n\r\n  Reign of Pepin the Short.\r\n\r\n  Reign of Charlemagne.\r\n\r\n  Epoch of transition.\r\n\r\n  Reigns of Louis the Débonnair and Charles the Bald.\r\n\r\n  Norman invasions.\r\n\r\n  The last Carlovingians.\r\n\r\n  Accession of Hugh Capet.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Tendency To Centralization.\r\n\r\nI have sketched the general progress of events in Frankish Gaul,\r\nunder the Merovingians; I have now to give a similar outline of\r\nthe reign of the Carlovingians. I shall enter neither into an\r\nexamination of the institutions, nor a detailed narrative of\r\noccurrences; I shall seek to sum up the facts in the general fact\r\nwhich includes them all.\r\n\r\nThe general tendency of events under the Merovingians was towards\r\ncentralization; and this tendency was natural. At that period, a\r\nsociety and a state were labouring to form and create themselves;\r\nand societies and states can be created only by the\r\ncentralization of interests and forces. The conquests and\r\nauthority of Clovis, however fleeting and incomplete they may\r\nhave been, indicate this need of centralization, which was then\r\npressing upon Roman and barbarian society. After the death of\r\nClovis, his dominions were dismembered, and formed into distinct\r\nkingdoms; but these kingdoms could not remain separate; they\r\ncontinually tended to reunite, and soon became reduced in number\r\nto two, which finally coalesced. A similar process took place in\r\nreference to the authority in the interior of each state. The\r\nroyal power attempted at first to be the centralizing principle,\r\nbut did not succeed; the aristocracy of the chiefs, the great\r\nlandowners, laboured to organize itself, and to produce its own\r\ngovernment; it produced it, at length, in the form of the Mayors\r\nof the Palace, who eventually became kings. After two hundred and\r\nseventy-one years of labour, all the Frankish kingdoms were\r\nreunited into one. The supreme power was more entirely\r\nconcentrated in the hands of the king, aided by the concurrence\r\nof the national assemblies, than it had ever been previously.\r\n\r\n{95}\r\n\r\nUnder Pepin the Short and Charlemagne, this centralization was\r\nmaintained, extended and regulated; and it appeared to gain\r\nstrength. New countries, new peoples, were incorporated into the\r\nFrankish state. The relations of the sovereign with his subjects\r\nbecame more numerous and regular. New bonds of union were\r\nestablished between the supreme power, its delegates, and its\r\nsubjects. A state and a government seemed likely to be formed.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Tendency To Dissolution.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Charlemagne, affairs presented quite another\r\naspect, and assumed a contrary direction. In proportion as a\r\ntendency to the centralization, either of the different states\r\namong themselves, or of the internal power of each state, had\r\nbeen visible under the rule of the Merovingian race, in just that\r\nproportion did a tendency to the dismemberment, to the\r\ndissolution, both of the states themselves and of the power in\r\neach state, become evident under the Carlovingians. Under the\r\nMerovingians, you have seen that five successive dismemberments\r\ntook place, none of which was able to last; after the death of\r\nCharlemagne, the kingdoms once separated do not reunite. Louis\r\nthe Debonnair divided the empire among his children, in 838, and\r\nmade vain efforts to maintain some unity therein. The treaty of\r\nVerdun, in 843, definitively separated the three monarchies.\r\nCharles the Fat, in 884, made an attempt to unite them again; but\r\nthis attempt also failed--reunion was impracticable.\r\n\r\nIn the interior of each state, and particularly in France, the\r\nsame phenomenon was manifested. The supreme power which, under\r\nthe Merovingians, had tended to become concentrated in the hands,\r\neither of the kings, or of the Mayors of the Palace, and which\r\nhad seemed to have attained this end under Pepin and Charlemagne,\r\ntook a contrary direction from the reign of Louis the Debonnair,\r\nand tended constantly to dissolution. The great landed\r\nproprietors who, under the first race, had been naturally urged\r\nto coalesce against the royal authority, now laboured only to\r\nelevate themselves, and to become sovereigns in their own\r\ndomains. The hereditary succession of benefices and offices\r\nbecame prevalent. Royalty was nothing more than a direct\r\nlordship, or an indirect and impotent suzerainty. Sovereignty was\r\ndispersed; there no longer existed any state, or head of the\r\nstate.\r\n{96}\r\nThe history of the Carlovingians is nothing but the struggle of\r\ndeclining royalty against that tendency which was continually\r\nrobbing and contracting it more and more. This was the dominant\r\ncharacter, the general progress of events, from Louis the\r\nDebonnair to Hugh Capet. I shall now refer to the principal facts\r\nof this epoch; in them I shall find proofs of the general fact\r\njust stated.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Pepin The Short.\r\n\r\nI. Pepin the Short (752-768). As this monarch had risen to power\r\nby the aid of the large landowners, the clergy, and the pope, he\r\nwas obliged, during the whole course of his reign, to treat with\r\nconsideration those powers which had supported him. He frequently\r\nconvoked national assemblies, and frequently met with opposition\r\nfrom them. It was not without extreme difficulty that he\r\nprevailed upon his chieftains to make war against the Lombards,\r\nat the request of Pope Stephen III. In order to retain the\r\nsupport of the clergy, Pepin ordered the holders of\r\necclesiastical benefices to perform the conditions annexed to\r\ntheir tenure of them; he lavished, donations upon the churches,\r\nand greatly augmented the importance of the bishops. It is from\r\nZachary's answer to Pepin, that the popes have assumed to deduce\r\ntheir historic right to make and unmake kings. Pepin thus\r\nfavoured the aggrandizement of the aristocracy, the clergy, and\r\nthe papacy,--three powers which had been very useful, and were\r\nstill of great service to him, which he knew how to manage and\r\nrestrain, but which, under other circumstances, would assuredly\r\nlabour to render themselves independent of the royal power, and\r\nwould promote the dismemberment, after having assisted in the\r\nconcentration of the kingdom. The moment most favourable for the\r\ndevelopment of these powers had arrived. They placed themselves\r\nat first at the service of the king, who was useful to them, and\r\nknew how to make them serviceable to himself; and thus they\r\nbecame able to free themselves from dependence upon him, and\r\nhenceforward to act alone and on their own account.\r\n\r\n{97}\r\n\r\n              Charlemagne.\r\n\r\nII. Charlemagne (768-814). Epochs of transition, in the history\r\nof society, have this singular characteristic, that they are\r\nmarked sometimes by great agitation, and sometimes by profound\r\nrepose. It is well worth while to study the causes of this\r\ndifference between epochs which are fundamentally similar in\r\nnature, and which do not constitute a fixed and durable state of\r\nsociety, but only a passage from one state to another. When the\r\ntransition occurs from a state of things which has long been\r\nestablished and is doomed to destruction, to a new state of\r\nthings which it will be necessary to create, it is generally full\r\nof agitation and violence. When, on the other hand, there exists\r\nno previous state of society, which from its long duration is\r\ndifficult to overthrow, the transition is only a momentary halt\r\nof society, fatigued by the disorder of its previous chaotic\r\nstate, and by the labour of creation. This was the character of\r\nthe reign of Charlemagne. The whole country of the Franks,\r\nwearied by the disorders of the first dynasty, and not having yet\r\noriginated the social system which was destined to issue\r\nnaturally from their conquest--I mean the feudal régime--stood\r\nstill for a time under the government of a great man who procured\r\nfor it greater order and more regular activity, than it had ever\r\nknown before. Until then, the two great powers which agitated the\r\ncountry--the great landowners and the clergy--had not been able\r\nto take a settled position. The royal authority was hostile to\r\nthem, and they attacked it. Charlemagne knew how to restrain and\r\nsatisfy them, and contrived to keep them employed without placing\r\nhimself in their power. This knowledge constituted his strength,\r\nand was the cause of the temporary order which he established\r\nthroughout his empire. In a future lecture, when studying the\r\ninstitutions of his epoch, we shall see what was the\r\ncharacteristic feature of his government. I am speaking now only\r\nof the fact itself--of the singular circumstance of the authority\r\nof a very powerful king being interposed between an age in which\r\nroyalty was held in slight esteem, and an age in which it almost\r\nceased to be of any importance. Charlemagne made of barbarian\r\nmonarchy all that he possibly could. He possessed within himself,\r\nin the necessities of his mind and life, an activity\r\ncorresponding to the general exigencies ol his age, which,\r\nindeed, surpassed them. The Franks desired war and booty;\r\nCharlemagne desired conquests, in order to extend his renown and\r\ndominion; the Franks were unwilling to be without a share in\r\ntheir own government; Charlemagne held frequent national\r\nassemblies, and employed the principal members of the territorial\r\naristocracy as dukes, counts, _missi dominici_, and in other\r\noffices.\r\n{98}\r\nThe clergy were anxious to possess consideration, authority, and\r\nwealth; Charlemagne held them in great respect, employed many\r\nbishops in the public service, bestowed on them rich endowments,\r\nand attached them firmly to him, by proving himself a munificent\r\nfriend and patron of those studies of which they were almost the\r\nonly cultivators. In every direction towards which the active and\r\nenergetic minds of the time turned their attention, Charlemagne\r\nwas always the first to look; and he proved himself more warlike\r\nthan the warriors, more careful of the interests of the church\r\nthan her most devout adherents, a greater friend of literature\r\nthan the most learned men, always foremost in every career, and\r\nthus bringing everything to a kind of unity, by the single fact\r\nthat his genius was everywhere in harmony with his age, because\r\nhe was its most perfect representative, and that he was capable\r\nof ruling it because he was superior to it. But the men who are\r\nthus before their age, in every respect, are the only men who can\r\ngain followers; Charlemagne's personal superiority was the\r\nindispensable condition of the transitory order which he\r\nestablished. Order did not at that time spring naturally from\r\nsociety; the victorious aristocracy had not yet attained the\r\norganization at which it aimed. Charlemagne, by keeping it\r\nemployed, diverted it temporarily from its object. When\r\nCharlemagne was dead, all the social forces which he had\r\nconcentrated and absorbed became in want of aliment; they resumed\r\ntheir natural tendencies, their intestine conflicts; they began\r\nonce more to aspire to the independence of isolation, and to\r\nsovereignty in their own neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Louis The Debonnair.\r\n\r\nIII. Louis the Debonnair (814-840). As soon as Louis became\r\nemperor, he lost the success which had attended him as king of\r\nAquitaine. Facts soon gave proof of that tendency to dissolution\r\nwhich pervaded the empire of Charlemagne, and which dispersed the\r\nauthority which he had been able to retain entire in his own\r\nhands. Louis gave kingdoms to his sons, and they were continually\r\nin revolt against him. The great landholders, the clergy, and the\r\npope--those three social forces which Charlemagne had so ably\r\nmanaged and restrained--escaped from the yoke of Louis the\r\nDebonnair, and acted sometimes in his favour, and sometimes\r\nagainst him.\r\n{99}\r\nThe clergy loaded him with reproaches, and forced him to do\r\npublic penance at Worms, in 829. An attempt was made, in 830, to\r\nmake him a monk, after the assembly at Compiègne, where he had\r\nconfessed his faults; and he was deposed, in 833, by another\r\nassembly at Compiègne, in pursuance of a conspiracy into which\r\nPope Gregory IV. had entered. During the whole course of this\r\nreign, nothing held together, everything was disjoined; both the\r\nstates which constituted the empire, and the great social forces,\r\nlay and ecclesiastical, in each state. Each of these forces\r\naspired to render itself independent. Louis the Debonnair\r\npresents a singular spectacle, in the midst of this dissolution,\r\nattempting to practise as a scholar the maxims of government laid\r\ndown by Charlemagne, enacting general laws against general\r\nabuses, prescribing rules for the guidance of all those forces\r\nwhich had escaped from his hands, and even endeavouring to\r\ncorrect the particular acts of injustice which had been committed\r\nunder the preceding reign. But the kings, the great landowners,\r\nthe bishops,--all had acquired a feeling of their own importance,\r\nand refused to obey an emperor who was no longer Charlemagne.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Charles The Bald.\r\n\r\nIV. Charles the Bald (840-877). The dissolution which had\r\ncommenced under Louis the Debonnair continued under his son\r\nCharles the Bald. His three brothers, [Footnote 12] relying\r\nalternately upon the pretensions of the clergy and of the large\r\nlandholders, disputed with him for the vast empire of\r\nCharlemagne.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 12: Lothaire, Pepin, and Louis the Germanic, the\r\n    three elder sons of Louis the Debonnair.]\r\n\r\nThe bloody battle of Fontenay, fought on the 25th of June, 841,\r\nmade Charles the Bald king of Neustria and Aquitaine, that is, of\r\nFrance. His reign is nothing but a continual alternation, a scene\r\nof futile efforts to prevent the dismemberment of his dominions\r\nand of his power. At one time, he robs the clergy in order to\r\nsatisfy the avidity of the great landholders, whose support he is\r\nanxious to gain; at another time, he spoils the landholders in\r\norder to appease the clergy, of whose assistance he stands in\r\nneed. His capitulars contain hardly anything but these impotent\r\nalternations. The hereditary succession of benefices and\r\nappointments became triumphant, and every chieftain laid the\r\nfoundation of his own independence.\r\n\r\n{100}\r\n\r\n              The Normans.\r\n\r\nV. The Normans. This is the generic name of the German and\r\nScandinavian tribes, who inhabited the shores of the Baltic.\r\nTheir maritime expeditions may be traced back to a very remote\r\nperiod. We meet with them under the first dynasty of Frankish\r\nkings; they frequently occur towards the end of the reign of\r\nCharlemagne, and under Louis the Debonnair; and they continually\r\nappear under Charles the Bald. They constituted a fresh cause of\r\nthe dismemberment of the empire, and of the royal authority. In\r\nthe ninth century, the Frankish Gauls present the same appearance\r\nwhich the Roman Gauls had offered four centuries before: that of\r\na government incapable of defending the country, and expelled or\r\nretiring in every direction, and of barbarians pillaging,\r\nimposing tribute, withdrawing on payment of large sums of money,\r\nand continually reappearing to levy fresh contributions.\r\nNevertheless, a notable difference is to be remarked between\r\nthese two epochs. In both, the central government was equally\r\nincapable and worn out; but, in the ninth century, there existed\r\nwithin the Frankish territory a host of chieftains, who, though\r\nlately barbarian invaders themselves, had become independent, and\r\nwere surrounded by warriors who defended themselves against the\r\nnew invaders with far greater energy than the Roman magistrates\r\nhad done, and who took advantage of the disturbed state of\r\nsociety to consolidate firmly their own individual sovereignties.\r\nAmong these chieftains, we meet with Robert the Strong, the\r\nancestor of the Capetian family, who became Duke of Neustria, in\r\n861, and was killed in 866, while defending Neustria against the\r\nNormans. The Normans definitively established themselves in\r\nNeustria, in 912, under Charles the Simple, who yielded the\r\nprovince to their chief Rollo, and gave him his daughter Grisella\r\nin marriage.\r\n\r\nVI. Charles the Fat. In 884, Charles the Fat, son of Louis the\r\nGermanic, temporarily collected under his rule nearly all the\r\ndominions of Charlemagne. The maintenance of this new\r\nconcentration of territory and power was impossible, and it was\r\ndissolved even before the death of Charles the Fat.\r\n\r\n{101}\r\n\r\nVII. In 888, Eudes, and in 923, Raoul, made themselves kings. The\r\nfirst, a count of Paris, was the son of Robert the Strong, and\r\nassumed the title of king, at the national assembly held at\r\nCompiègne. The second was Duke of Burgundy, and husband of Emma,\r\nthe grand-daughter of Robert the Strong, and sister of Hugo the\r\nGreat, Duke of France. These kings were not, like the Mayors of\r\nthe Palace at the termination of the first dynasty, the\r\nrepresentatives of a powerful aristocracy. The landed aristocracy\r\nof the tenth century had no further need of representation; no\r\npower could struggle effectively against them. Every great\r\nlandowner was absolute master in his own estates, and the kings\r\nwere only great barons, who, having become independent, assumed\r\nthe title of kings, with the aid of their vassals. A portion of\r\nthe lords who had thus become independent, remained indifferent\r\nto quarrels which did not disturb their rights and their power.\r\nThey cared little whether there was a king, or who was king. The\r\ndescendants of Charlemagne retained for some considerable time a\r\nparty of adherents, for the idea and feeling of the rightfulness\r\nof a hereditary succession to the crown, that is, of legitimacy,\r\nwere already powerful; but in 987, the conflict ceased, and Hugh\r\nCapet became king.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Tendency To Dissolution.\r\n\r\nThe general fact which characterizes this epoch,--a tendency to\r\ndismemberment and dissolution,--is frequently met with in the\r\ncourse of the history of the human race. At first, we see the\r\ninterests, forces, and ideas which exist in society, labouring to\r\nbecome united, to concentrate themselves, and to produce a\r\nsuitable form of government. When this concentration has been\r\nonce effected, and this government has been once produced, we\r\nfind that, at the end of a certain time, it becomes exhausted and\r\nincapable of maintaining it entirely; new interests, new forces,\r\nand new ideas, which do not harmonize with each other, arise and\r\ncome into action; then the dissolution begins, the elements of\r\nsociety become separated, and the bonds of government are\r\nrelaxed. A conflict commences between the forces which tend to\r\nseparation, and the authority which strives to maintain union.\r\nWhen the dissolution shall be consummated, then will begin a new\r\nwork of concentration.\r\n\r\n{102}\r\n\r\n              Formation And Dissolution.\r\n\r\nThis occurred after the fall of the second dynasty in France. The\r\nprevalence of the feudal system had caused the dissolution of the\r\ngovernment and the state; the government and the state laboured\r\nto reconstitute themselves, and to regain their unity and\r\nconsistency. This great work was not definitively accomplished\r\nuntil the reign of Louis XIV.; the social forces had then become\r\nonce more concentrated in the hands of royalty. Our own times\r\nhave witnessed a fresh dissolution.\r\n\r\nWhat we observe, then, during the years from 481 to 987, is a\r\ngeneral phenomenon, characteristic of the progress of the human\r\nrace. This phenomenon occurs not only in the political history of\r\nsocieties, but also in every occupation in which the activity of\r\nman finds exercise. In intellectual order, for example, we find\r\nat first that chaos reigns; the most divergent attempts to\r\nresolve the great questions of the nature and destiny of man, are\r\nmade in the midst of the universal ignorance. By degrees,\r\nopinions become assimilated, a school is formed, founded by a\r\nsuperior man; it is joined by almost all men of mind. Ere long,\r\nin the midst of this very school, diverse opinions arise,\r\ncontend, and become separated; dissolution begins once again in\r\nintellectual order, and will continue until a new unity is\r\nformed, and regains the empire.\r\n\r\nSuch, also, is the course of nature herself in her great and\r\nmysterious operations. This continual alternation of formation\r\nand dissolution, of life and death, recurs in all things, and\r\nunder all forms. Spirit gathers matter together and gives it\r\nanimation,--uses, and then abandons it. It falls a prey to some\r\nfermentation, after which it will reappear under a new aspect, to\r\nreceive once more that spirit which alone can impart to it life,\r\norder, and unity.\r\n\r\n{103}\r\n\r\n                   Lecture XII.\r\n\r\n  Ancient institutions of the Franks.\r\n\r\n  They are more difficult of study than those of the\r\n  Anglo-Saxons.\r\n\r\n  Three kinds of landed property; allodial, beneficiary,\r\n  and tributary lands.\r\n\r\n  Origin of allodial lands.\r\n\r\n  Meaning of the word allodium.\r\n\r\n  Salic land amongst the Franks.\r\n\r\n  Essential characteristics of the allods.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Primitive Institutions Of The Franks.\r\n\r\nThe primitive institutions of the Franks are much more difficult\r\nof study than those of the Anglo-Saxons.\r\n\r\nI. In the Frankish monarchy, the old Gallo-Roman people still\r\nsubsisted; they in part retained their laws and customs; their\r\nlanguage even predominated; Gaul was more civilised, more\r\norganised, more Romanised than Great Britain, in which nearly all\r\nthe original inhabitants of the country were either destroyed or\r\ndispersed.\r\n\r\nII. Gaul was divided among various barbarian peoples, each of\r\nwhom had its own laws, its own kingdom, its own history; the\r\nFranks, the Visigoths, the Burgundians; and the continual\r\nalternations of the Frankish monarchy between dislocation and\r\nre-union, long destroyed all unity in its history.\r\n\r\nIII. The conquerors were dispersed over a much larger extent of\r\nterritory; and central institutions were weaker, more diverse,\r\nand more complicated.\r\n\r\nIV. Of the two systems of social and political order, contained\r\nin the cradle of modern nations--I mean the feudal system and the\r\nrepresentative system--the latter has long prevailed in England,\r\nwhile the former long maintained its sway in France. The ancient\r\nnational institutions of the Franks were absorbed into the feudal\r\nsystem, in whose train came absolute power. Those of the Saxons,\r\non the other hand, were more or less maintained and perpetuated,\r\nto end at length in the representative system, which rendered\r\nthem clear by giving them due development.\r\n\r\n{104}\r\n\r\nPerhaps, also, the difficulty of the study of the ancient\r\nFrankish institutions arises in some measure from the fact that\r\nwe possess more documents respecting the Franks than respecting\r\nthe Saxons. Because we are acquainted with more facts, we have\r\ngreater trouble in harmonizing them. We believe we are better\r\ninformed because we know less.\r\n\r\nSuch being the case, I wish to state with precision the object of\r\nmy researches, so as not to lose time in useless digressions. I\r\ndo not propose that we should study together either the state of\r\nFrankish society in all its departments, or the history of all\r\nits vicissitudes. I am desirous to investigate and explain to\r\nyou, first, what constituted in France, from the fifth to the\r\ntenth century, the political part of the nation, possessing\r\npolitical rights and liberties; and secondly, by what\r\ninstitutions these rights were exercised, and these liberties\r\nguaranteed. We shall frequently be obliged to make excursions\r\nbeyond these limits in search of the facts necessary to the\r\nsolution of the questions contained therein; but we shall not\r\ndwell long upon such extraneous matter.\r\n\r\nIn the pursuit of this study, we shall find the works of German\r\nauthors of incontestable utility. A principal cause of the errors\r\nof the leading French writers who have treated of the subject, is\r\nthat they have attempted to derive all our institutions from\r\nGermany, from the condition of the Franks before the invasion,\r\nand that, at the same time, they have been unacquainted with the\r\nlanguage, the history, and the learned researches of the purely\r\nGerman peoples, that is, of the nations which have most\r\nthoroughly retained the primitive elements of Frankish society,\r\nand which formed a considerable portion of the Frankish monarchy.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Views Of Hullmann.\r\n\r\nDr. Hullmann, a professor at the University of Bonn, has written\r\na book on the origin of the various social states or conditions,\r\nthe object of which is to prove that all modern social order,\r\npolitical as well as civil, derives its origin from the\r\ncircumstance, that the peoples of modern times have been\r\nagriculturists, devoted to the possession and fixed cultivation\r\nof land. This view, although incomplete, is of much importance.\r\nIt is certain that, in the history of Europe, ever since the fall\r\nof the Roman Empire, the condition of persons has been closely\r\nconnected with that of landed property, and that the one throws\r\nlight upon the other. Though all history would not prove that\r\nthis has been the case from the beginning, yet the long-continued\r\npredominance of the feudal system, which consists precisely in\r\nthe intimate connection and amalgamation of the relations of\r\nlands with those of persons, would alone be sufficient to\r\ndemonstrate it unquestionably.\r\n\r\n{105}\r\n\r\n              Condition Of Lands.\r\n\r\nAt the outset, the condition of persons gave rise to that of\r\nlands; according as a man was more or less free, more or less\r\npowerful, the land which he possessed or cultivated assumed a\r\ncorresponding character. The condition of lands afterwards became\r\nthe symbol of the condition of persons; according as a man\r\npossessed or cultivated such and such a domain, he was more or\r\nless free and more or less important in the State. Originally,\r\nthe man gave its character to the estate; in the sequel, the\r\nestate gave his character to the man: and as symbols quickly\r\nbecome causes, the condition of persons was at length not only\r\nindicated, but determined by, and consequent upon, the condition\r\nof lands. Social conditions became in some degree incorporated\r\nwith the soil: and a man found himself possessed of a certain\r\nrank and of a certain degree of liberty and social importance,\r\ncorresponding to the character of the land which he occupied. In\r\nstudying modern history, we must not for a moment lose sight of\r\nthese vicissitudes in the condition of lands, and of the varied\r\ninfluence they exerted upon the condition of persons.\r\n\r\nThere is some advantage in first studying the condition of lands,\r\nin so far as it was a symbol of the condition of persons, because\r\nthe former is somewhat more determinate than the latter. It is\r\nalso less complicated; the condition of persons frequently varied\r\nupon lands of the same condition; and the same persons have\r\npossessed lands of different conditions. Our information,\r\nrespecting the condition of lands, is also more than exact.\r\n\r\nIn studying the condition of landed property and its\r\nvicissitudes, I do not propose to investigate its civil\r\ncondition, or to consider property in all its civil relations,\r\nsuch as successions, bequests, and alienations. I intend to\r\nconsider it only in its relation to the condition of persons, and\r\nas a symbol or cause of the various conditions of society. In the\r\nperiod which we are about to study, from the fifth to the tenth\r\ncentury, we have this advantage: that it contains a complete\r\nsystem, both as regards landed property, and also with respect to\r\nthe condition of persons and the political institutions of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n{106}\r\n              Allodial Lands.\r\n\r\nAt this period, we meet with three kinds of landed property: 1st.\r\nAllodial lands; 2nd. Beneficiary lands; and 3rd. Tributary lands.\r\n\r\n1st. Of allodial lands or _Allods_.--These were lands\r\npossessed in absolute right, which the proprietor held from no\r\none, on account of which he owed nothing to any superior, and of\r\nwhich he had full liberty to dispose. The lands taken or received\r\nas booty by the Franks, at the time of the conquest of Gaul, or\r\nin their subsequent conquests, were originally allodial. At a\r\nlater period it was said that a man held an allodium, only from\r\nGod and his sword. Hugh Capet said that he held the crown of\r\nFrance in this manner, because he had received it from no one.\r\nSuch tenures were mementos of conquest.\r\n\r\nThe word _alode_ itself indicates that the first allods were\r\nlands, which fell to the conquerors either by lot or division;\r\n_loos_, lot; _allotted, allotment;_ whence also came\r\nthe French word, _loterie_. Among the Burgundians,\r\nVisigoths, Lombards, and others, we find positive traces of this\r\ndivision of the lands allotted to the conquerors. They took\r\npossession of two-thirds of the land, that is, not of the whole\r\nextent of the country, but of the land in any locality, where a\r\nbarbarian of any importance took up his residence. The lands\r\nwhich thus fell to the barbarians, were called _Sortes\r\nBurgundionum, Gothorum,_ and so on. We do not find among the\r\nFranks positive traces of such a division of the land; but we\r\nknow, nevertheless, that they divided their booty by lot.\r\n\r\nThe word _alode_, then, was probably applied at first only\r\nto the lands taken by the victors in virtue of their conquests.\r\nAnother proof of this is that allodial property, properly so\r\ncalled, was long distinguished from the lands held also in\r\nabsolute right, and entailing no acknowledgment of a superior,\r\nbut which had been acquired by purchase or in any other way. A\r\ndistinction was also made among allodial lands, of _salic_\r\nland, which could be inherited only by males. This was probably\r\nthe original allod, the land acquired at the time of the\r\nconquest, and which thereupon became the primitive and principal\r\nestablishment of the head of the family. _Terra salica_ is\r\nthe _terra aviatica_ of the Ripuarian Franks, the _terra\r\nsortis titulo adquisita_ of the Burgundians, the\r\n_hæreditas_ of the Saxons, and the _terra paterna_ of\r\nthe formulas of Marculf.\r\n\r\n{107}\r\n\r\n              Salic Land.\r\n\r\nVarious explanations have been given of the term _salic\r\nland_. Montesquieu thinks that it was the land belonging to\r\nthe house, from the word, _sal_, hall. This explanation is\r\nsupported by Hullmann. It would thus be the _in-land_ of the\r\nAnglo-Saxons. It is probable that originally the _terra\r\nsalica_ was in fact the land connected with _the_ house,\r\nthe residence of the chieftain. The two explanations would thus\r\ncoincide; but the former is more complete and historical than the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nThe name of _allod_ was extended by degrees to all lands\r\npossessed in absolute right, and held from no superior, whether\r\nthey were the original allods or not. The words _proprium,\r\npossessio, prædium, hæreditas,_ were then employed as synonyms\r\nof _allodium_. It was probably at this period also that the\r\nrigorous interdict which excluded females from succession to\r\nsalic land, fell into desuetude. It would have been too harsh to\r\nexclude them from succession to all allodial property. There were\r\nsome doubts entertained on this point as early as the time when\r\nthe salic law was drawn up; and Marculf has transmitted to us a\r\nformula which proves that, although it was the common law to\r\ndeprive females of all succession to primitive allods, a father\r\nmight, nevertheless, by his will, give his daughter an equal\r\nshare with his sons in the division of all his property, of\r\nwhatever nature.\r\n\r\nThe essential and primitive characteristic of the\r\n_allodium_, consisted in the absoluteness of the property;\r\nthe right to give it away, to alienate it, to bequeath it by\r\ninheritance or will, &c. Its second characteristic was that it\r\ndepended upon no superior, and involved no service or tribute of\r\nany kind to any individual. But although allodial lands were\r\nexempt from all private charges towards individuals, does it\r\nfollow that they were also exempt from all public charges as\r\nregarded the state, or the king as head of the State? This\r\nquestion has been differently answered by learned men.\r\n\r\nAt the period to which we allude, there were no public charges\r\nproperly so called, no obligations imposed and fulfilled as\r\nregarded the State, or its head. All was limited to personal\r\nrelations between individuals; and from the relations of man with\r\nman arose the mutual relations of landed property, which were not\r\ncarried further than those of persons.\r\n\r\n{108}\r\n\r\n              Charges On Allodial Lands.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen this; the position of the Franks after the\r\nconquest resulted from the combination of their anterior\r\nrelations with their new position. The freeman, who held his land\r\nfrom no one, had no obligations or charges to fulfil to any one\r\non account of his land. In such a state of civilization, liberty\r\nis the appanage of force. The Franks who possessed allodial\r\nlands, and were strong enough to be under no obligation of duty\r\nto any more powerful individual, would not have comprehended the\r\nnecessity of owing service to an abstract being like the State,\r\nwith which, moreover, they had no personal relation.\r\n\r\nHowever, as society cannot exist in such a state of dissolution,\r\narising from the isolation of individuals, new relations were\r\nprogressively formed between the proprietors of allodial lands,\r\nwhich relations imposed certain charges on them.\r\n\r\n1st. The gifts presented to the kings either at the holding of\r\nthe Champs de Mars or Mai, or when they come to pass any time in\r\nany particular province. The kings had no fixed habitation. These\r\ngifts, though at first purely voluntary, became gradually\r\nconverted into a sort of obligation, from which allodial lands\r\nwere not exempt. That these gifts had become obligatory is proved\r\nby a list drawn up at Aix-la-Chapelle in 817, during the reign of\r\nLouis the Debonnair, which enumerates the monasteries which had\r\nto pay them, and those which had not.\r\n\r\n2nd. The supply of provisions and means of transport to the\r\nking's ambassadors, and to the foreign envoys, on their passage\r\nthrough the country.\r\n\r\n3rd. Of the various barbarian nations which were successively\r\nincorporated into the kingdom of the Franks, several paid tribute\r\nto the Frankish kings; and of this tribute it is probable that\r\nthe free or allodial lands, possessed by these nations,\r\ncontributed their share. It consisted of a certain number of\r\ncows, hogs, and horses. The nature of these tributes proves that\r\nthey were not distributed among the lands, but imposed upon the\r\nnation as a whole.\r\n\r\n4th. A more important charge, namely, military service, was\r\nimposed upon allodial lands. In our next lecture, we shall see\r\nhow this charge was introduced.\r\n\r\n{109}\r\n\r\n              Lecture XIII.\r\n\r\n  Origin of military service; its cause and limits.\r\n\r\n  It was made a general obligation by Charlemagne.\r\n\r\n  Allodial lands were originally exempt from taxation.\r\n\r\n  Origin of benefices.\r\n\r\n  Change in the position of the German chiefs in consequence of\r\n  their territorial settlement.\r\n\r\n  Their wealth.\r\n\r\n  No public treasury.\r\n\r\n  The _œrarium_ and _fiscus_ of the old Roman republic.\r\n\r\n  Formation of the private domain of the kings of France.\r\n\r\n  Character of benefices.\r\n\r\n  Error of Montesquieu on this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Origin Of Military Service.\r\n\r\nI have indicated some of the new relations which became\r\nprogressively established between the proprietors of allodial\r\nlands and the services that resulted from them. I have to occupy\r\nyou to-day with the consideration of military service and\r\nbenefices.\r\n\r\nOriginally, military service was imposed on a man by virtue of\r\nhis quality, his nationality before the conquest, and not by\r\nreason of his wealth. After the conquest, there was no legal\r\nobligation to it whatever; it was a natural result of the\r\nposition occupied by the Franks,--who were constantly called upon\r\nto defend what they had conquered,--and of their taste for\r\nwarlike expeditions, and for pillage. It was, also, a kind of\r\nmoral obligation which each man owed to the chief whom he had\r\nchosen. This connexion continued the same as in Germany; the\r\nchief proposed an expedition to his men, and if they approved of\r\nit, they set out. Thus, we find Theodoric proposed to the\r\nAustrasian Franks an expedition against Thuringia. Often the\r\nwarriors themselves summoned their chief to conduct them on some\r\nparticular expedition, threatening to forsake him, and seek\r\nanother chief, in the event of his refusal. Under the\r\nMerovingians, a kind of regularity, some sort of legal\r\nobligation, was introduced into the military convocations, and a\r\npenalty was inflicted upon those who did not present themselves.\r\nThe obligation was imposed, and the penalty inflicted, even in\r\ncases where no movement was required in defence of the country.\r\n{110}\r\nThe proprietors ol allodial lands were not exempted; many,\r\ndoubtless, went on their own free choice, but the feeble were\r\nconstrained. This was, however, an obligation attached rather to\r\nthe quality of a free man, a Frank, or an associate, than to\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nNot until the reign of Charlemagne, do we see the obligation to\r\nmilitary service imposed on all free men, proprietors of\r\nfreeholds, as well as of benefices, and regulated by property\r\nqualifications. This service now appeared no longer as a\r\nvoluntary act; it was no longer the consequence of the simple\r\nrelation between a chief and his associates, but a truly public\r\nservice imposed on every individual of the nation, in proportion\r\nto the nature and extent of his territorial possessions.\r\nCharlemagne was very vigilant in seeing that the system of\r\nrecruiting which he had established, should be faithfully carried\r\nout; we have a proof of this in his capitulary, issued in the\r\nform of instructions to the _missi dominici_, in the year\r\n812. This is an exceedingly minute account of the particulars and\r\ncharges of military service. These charges remained under the\r\nsame conditions during the reigns of Charlemagne's immediate\r\nsuccessors. Under Charles the Bald, they were restricted to the\r\ncase of an invasion of the country by a foreigner\r\n(_landwehr_). The relation of the vassal to his lord, at\r\nthat time, prevailed completely over that of the citizen to the\r\nchief ruler of the state.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Exemption Of Freeholds From Imposts.\r\n\r\nAlthough allodial lands were exempt from imposts, properly so\r\ncalled, more because there were no general imposts whatever than\r\nbecause of any special immunity from them possessed by allodial\r\nlands, yet we find the kings used every favourable opportunity to\r\nattempt to attach imposts to men and lands, which they believed\r\nrightfully exempt from them; complaints were made of these\r\nattempts as acts of injustice; they were resisted, and sometimes\r\nredress was sought, as under Chilperic, in 578, in Austrasia;\r\nunder Theodebert, in 547; and under Clovis II., in 615. We find\r\nalso, that, on the occasion of great and alarming emergencies,\r\nthe kings imposed certain charges on proprietors, without\r\ndistinction, requiring them to lend their assistance, either to\r\nthe poor, or to the state. Thus, Charlemagne, in 779, during a\r\nfamine, and Charles the Bald, in 877, in order to pay the tribute\r\ndue to the Normans, made such general claims. In both these\r\ncases, the charge was adjusted to the quality of persons and\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\n{111}\r\n\r\n              Distribution Of Lands.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that, originally, allodial lands did\r\nnot exist in large numbers, especially among the Franks.\r\n\r\nThere is no ground for supposing that the Franks took possession\r\nof, and shared the lands, wherever they made expeditions and\r\nconquests. They rather cared for the booty which they carried\r\noff, and the cattle which they took with them, instead of forming\r\na settlement themselves. For a long time, the greater part of the\r\nFranks did not often forsake their first habitations on the banks\r\nof the Meuse and the Rhine; thither they returned after their\r\nexpeditions.\r\n\r\nWe may conclude that lands were most probably distributed in the\r\nfollowing manner. Each chief took a portion for himself and his\r\nassociates, who lived on the land of their chief. It would be\r\nabsurd to suppose that each band would dissolve itself, and the\r\nseparated individuals then retire each to his isolated share of\r\nland; there were no individual shares, or, certainly, but few.\r\nThis is sufficiently proved by the fact that the greater number\r\nof Franks appear to have been without landed property, living as\r\ncultivators on the lands, and in the _villæ_ of a chief, or\r\nof the king. Often, even, a man would place himself not only\r\nunder the protection, but at the disposal of another, to serve\r\nhim during his life, on condition of being fed and clothed, and\r\nyet without ceasing to be free. This kind of contract, the\r\nformula for which has been preserved, must have been very common,\r\nand explains the circumstance that so large a number of free men\r\nare found to have lived and served on lands not belonging to\r\nthemselves. Probably, the number of Franks who became\r\nsuccessively proprietors, by means of benefices, was greater than\r\nthe number of those who were primitively allodial proprietors.\r\n\r\nThe larger number ol small allodial proprietors were gradually\r\nrobbed of their possessions, or reduced to the condition of\r\ntributaries, by the usurpation of their neighbours, or of\r\npowerful chiefs. Of this, there are innumerable examples. The\r\nlaws made, from the seventh to the tenth century, give evidence\r\nof the tendency of large allodial estates or benefices to absorb\r\nsmall freeholds. The statute of Louis the Debonnair, referring to\r\nthe complaints of the Spanish refugees in the south, explains\r\npretty accurately the system according to which properties\r\nchanged hands.\r\n\r\n{112}\r\n\r\nDonations to churches also tended incessantly to reduce the\r\nnumber of allodial estates. They would probably soon have\r\ndisappeared altogether, had not a cause of an opposite character\r\ntended continually to create new ones. As allodial property was\r\nsure and permanent, while benefices were precarious and more\r\ndependent, the proprietors of benefices constantly sought to\r\nconvert their benefices into allodial estates. The capitularies\r\nwhich remain to us prove this at every step. It is probable that\r\nlarge new allodial estates were thus created, but small ones\r\ntended to disappear.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Beneficiary Lands.\r\n\r\nFinally, under Charles the Bald, a singular circumstance presents\r\nitself. This was the very time when the system of allodial\r\nproperty was preparing, so to speak, to merge itself in the\r\nsystem of beneficiary property, which is synonymous with\r\nfeudalism; and precisely at that time the name of _Allods_\r\nis more frequent than ever. We find it applied to properties\r\nwhich are evidently benefices. This name still designated a\r\nproperty more surely hereditary and independent, and as benefices\r\nwere ordinarily hereditary and independent, they were called\r\nallods, just in order to indicate their new character; and the\r\nking himself, whose interest it especially was that his benefices\r\nshould not become allods, gave them this name, as if it had\r\nbecome their conventional designation. Sixty years previously,\r\nCharlemagne had made the greatest efforts to prevent benefices\r\nfrom becoming allods.\r\n\r\nHaving thus explained the nature and changes of allods, I pass on\r\nto the consideration of _benefices_.\r\n\r\n_Benefices_, which constituted the cradle of the feudal\r\nsystem, were a natural result of the relations anciently\r\nsubsisting in Germany between a chief and his associates. As the\r\npower of these chiefs resided only in the strength of their band\r\nof associates, all their attention was directed to the means of\r\nenlarging the number of these followers. Tacitus relates how,\r\nbeing charged with the maintenance and preservation of their\r\nfollowers, they gained and kept them by means of constant\r\nwarfare, by dividing to them the spoils of the empire, by gifts\r\nof arms and horses. After the conquest, when the territorial\r\nestablishment took place, the position of the chiefs was altered.\r\n\r\n{113}\r\n\r\n              Private Domains Of The Kings.\r\n\r\nHitherto, in their wandering life, they had lived solely upon\r\nrapine; then they possessed two kinds of wealth, moveable booty\r\nand lands. They made their companions other presents, which\r\nengaged them in another kind of life. These riches, both moveable\r\nand fixed, remained for the chiefs, as for all others, as their\r\npersonal and private property. The Frankish society had not then\r\narrived at any ideas of public property. It consisted only of\r\nindividuals, powerful by reason of their courage and their talent\r\nfor war, by the antiquity of their family, and the renown of\r\ntheir name, who collected around them other individuals, who\r\npassed their life in the same precarious manner. The republics of\r\nantiquity did not commence thus. Rome had soon its public\r\ntreasure--its _ærarium_. Till nearly the close of the\r\nrepublic, the _ærarium_ still remained. Augustus established\r\nthe _fiscus_, the treasury of the prince, which was destined\r\nto absorb the _ærarium_. The _fiscus_, at first,\r\nreceived only private gifts to the prince, but it soon usurped\r\nall the public revenues, till it became at length the only\r\nrepository for public wealth. Thus, despotism transformed a\r\npublic into a private domain. The states founded on the ruins of\r\nthe Roman empire have followed an opposite course. At their\r\ncommencement, all property was private property. It is in\r\nconsequence of the development of civilization, and free\r\ninstitutions, that in almost all monarchies private domains have\r\ngradually become public property.\r\n\r\nThe private domains of the chiefs of bands, and particularly of\r\nthe Frankish kings, were at first composed of lands taken from\r\nthe inhabitants of the countries in which they established\r\nthemselves. I have already stated that they did not take all the\r\nlands, but a large number of them. The share of the chief must\r\nhave been considerable, as is indicated by the numerous domains\r\nof the chiefs of the first two races, in Belgium, in Flanders,\r\nand on the banks of the Rhine, where they first formed their\r\nsettlements. Hullmann has given a list of a hundred and\r\ntwenty-three domains beyond the Meuse belonging to the\r\nCarlovingian family.\r\n\r\nThe private property of the chiefs of conquered peoples were, to\r\na great extent at least, incorporated into the domain of the\r\nconquering chief. Clovis subjected to himself successively\r\nseveral petty monarchs in his neighbourhood--Ragnachair at\r\nCambray, Chararich in Belgium, and Siegbert at Cologne; and took\r\npossession of all their personal property.\r\n\r\n{114}\r\n\r\nThe substitution of the royalty of one family for that of\r\nanother, augmented the private domain of the king; the new king\r\nwould add to his own personal possessions the property of the\r\ndethroned king. Thus the large domains possessed by the family of\r\nthe Pepins, in Belgium, and on the Rhine, became royal domains.\r\n\r\nLegal confiscations, as a punishment for crime, cases in which no\r\nlegal heir was to be found for property, unjust and violent\r\nconfiscations--were other sources of personal wealth to kings.\r\n\r\nIn these ways, the private domain of the kings increased rapidly,\r\nand it was employed by them especially as a means of attaching\r\ntheir associates to them, and of gaining new ones. Benefices,\r\nthen, are as ancient as the establishment of the Franks on a\r\nfixed territory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t      Tenure Of Benefices.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental question which has divided historians, whether\r\nthose who are merely scholars or the philosophers, is--were\r\nbenefices given for a time and revocable at will, or were they\r\nfor life and yet revertible, or were they hereditary? Montesquieu\r\nhas aimed at establishing a historical progression among these\r\ndifferent modes; he asserts that benefices were at first\r\nrevocable, being given for a time, then for life, and then\r\nhereditary. I believe he is mistaken, and that his mistake arises\r\nfrom an attempt to systematize history, and bring its facts into\r\nregular marching order. In the giving and receiving of benefices,\r\ntwo tendencies have always coexisted: on the one hand, those who\r\nhad received benefices wished to retain them, and even to make\r\nthem hereditary; on the other hand, the kings who granted them\r\nwished to resume them, or to grant them for only a limited\r\nperiod. All the disputes that occurred between kings and their\r\npowerful subjects, all the treaties which arose out of these\r\ndisputes, all the promises which were made with a view to appease\r\nthe dissatisfaction of malcontents, prove that the kings were in\r\nthe habit of taking back, by violence, the benefices they had\r\ngranted, and that the nobles attempted to retain them also by\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\n{115}\r\n              Disputes About Benefices.\r\n\r\nThe Mayors of the Palace acquired their power by placing\r\nthemselves at the head of the large possessors of benefices, and\r\nby seconding their pretensions. Under the administration of Pepin\r\nthe Short and Charlemagne, the struggle appeared to cease,\r\nbecause the kings had for a time great superiority in force; but,\r\nin reality, the kings were now the aggressors in their turn, who\r\nendeavoured to bring the benefices again into their own hands,\r\nand to preserve to themselves the free disposal of them. Under\r\nCharles the Bald, the kings again began to get feeble, and, in\r\nconsequence the treaties and promises became again favourable to\r\nthe beneficiaries. In fact, the history of benefices, from the\r\ntime of Clovis till the full establishment of the feudal system,\r\nis only a perpetual struggle between these two opposing\r\ntendencies. An attentive and accurate examination of the facts\r\nwill prove that the three modes of conceding benefices did not\r\nfollow one another in regular chronological succession, but that\r\nthey are to be found existing and operating simultaneously during\r\nthe whole course of this period.\r\n\r\n{116}\r\n\r\n               Lecture XIV.\r\n\r\n  Proofs of the co-existence of various modes of conferring\r\n  benefices, from the fifth to the tenth century.\r\n\r\n  Of benefices that were absolutely and arbitrarily revocable.\r\n\r\n  Of benefices conceded for a limited time; the_precaria_.\r\n\r\n  Of benefices granted for life.\r\n\r\n  Of benefices granted hereditarily.\r\n\r\n  General character of the concession of benefices.\r\n\r\n  Their tendency to become hereditary.\r\n\r\n  Its prevalence under Charles the Bald.\r\n\r\n  Military service.\r\n\r\n  Judicial and domestic service.\r\n\r\n  Origin, meaning, and vicissitudes of the fidelity due by the\r\n  vassal to his lord.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Transference Of Benefices.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the invasion of the Gauls by the Franks up to\r\nthe moment when the feudal system was definitely constituted, we\r\nfind during the whole course of this epoch:\r\n\r\nI. That benefices were revoked, not only as a consequence of\r\nlegal condemnation, but also by the arbitrary will of the donor.\r\nThe power of absolute and arbitrary transference of benefices was\r\npractically in existence under the Merovingian kings. It is\r\nhowever very doubtful whether this has ever been recognised as\r\nthe right of the donors. Such an act possessed a character of\r\nsuddenness and violence which gave a shock to ideas of natural\r\njustice. Few men would consent to receive a favour of which they\r\nmight legally have been deprived at the first moment of caprice.\r\nMontesquieu affirms that benefices were first held on an entirely\r\nuncertain tenure. The proofs which he gives are but of little\r\nweight. _First_, the clause contained in the treaty\r\nconcluded at Andely, in 587, between the two monarchs, Gontran\r\nand Childebert, proves the fact but not the right.\r\n_Secondly_, the formula of Marculf again does not prove\r\nanything more than a common practice. Besides, the giver of the\r\nbenefice presents a motive in this formula, namely, the necessity\r\nof the exchange. _Thirdly_, the law of the Lombards merely\r\ncharacterises the benefice as a precarious property, which it\r\nindubitably was. _Fourthly_, the _Book of Fiefs_\r\ncompiled in the twelfth century, probably converted the fact into\r\na right. _Fifthly_, the letter of the bishops to Louis the\r\nGermanic also proves merely the fact.\r\n{117}\r\nIt is evident that the right has always been contested, and that\r\nattempts have always been made to prevent the permanency of\r\nbenefices is a fact also. \"Charlemagne,\" says Eginhard, \"did not\r\nsuffer that every noble should take away from his vassal the\r\nbenefices which he had granted to him upon any outburst of\r\nanger.\" The capitulary of Louis the Debonnair, which allows a\r\nyear to the rejected incumbent whose benefice is in a bad\r\ncondition before it can be finally taken from him, proves\r\nlikewise that certain forms were observed with this view, and\r\nprotests against a purely arbitrary disposition. That the patron\r\nhad a right to take away the benefice, when the occupant had\r\nfailed to discharge his obligations, is an indisputable fact. Now\r\nit would be very easy to abuse this principle of taking away\r\nbenefices under a pretext of disorderly conduct or infidelity to\r\nthe trust reposed; accordingly all the protestations that were\r\nmade, and all the treaties that were enforced, were designed to\r\noppose such a procedure.\r\n\r\nThus we find, from the fifth to the tenth century: _First_,\r\nnumerous examples of benefices being arbitrarily taken away; this\r\nwas the practice of the giver, when his power corresponded to his\r\ndesire. _Secondly_, benefices taken away on account of\r\nunfaithfulness, disorder, treachery; this was a right.\r\n\r\n\r\n              The Precaria.\r\n\r\nII. As to benefices granted for a limited time, Montesquieu\r\naffirms, after the _Book of Fiefs_, that they were at first\r\ngranted for one year. I have not been able to find any positive\r\nexample of this. It is not however impossible that there may have\r\nbeen such, similar to the _precaria_ belonging to churches.\r\n_Precarium_, among the Romans, signified a grant of property\r\non the tenure of usufruct for a limited time, which was generally\r\npretty short. Under the monarchy of the Franks, we have seen that\r\nthe churches often consolidated their wealth in this way, in\r\norder to secure a permanent revenue. Charles the Bald decreed\r\nthat the _precaria_ should be held for five years and\r\nrenewed every five years.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Seizure Of Church Property.\r\n\r\nThe only benefices which appear to me to have been granted for a\r\ntime, ostensibly so at least, are those which arose out of the\r\necclesiastical wealth taken by Charles Martel (about A.D. 720),\r\nand which were then possessed under the designation\r\n_precarious_.\r\n{118}\r\nBefore this period we find kings and mayors interposing their\r\nauthority in order to obtain, under the title of\r\n_precarious_, the enjoyment of certain church wealth for\r\ncertain persons. It appears that Charles Martel did more at that\r\ntime than grant or cause the retention of church property, under\r\nthe title of _precaria_,--he also completely stripped the\r\nchurches, in order to confer their wealth as benefices. But,\r\nafter him, Pepin and Carloman, his sons, while they also took the\r\nwealth of churches in order to confer them on their vassals, only\r\ntook it on the title of _precaria_. The ecclesiastics\r\nprotested vigorously against the spoliation of Charles Martel,\r\nand it was upon their protestations that Pepin ordained that the\r\nwealth which could be restored should be actually returned, and\r\nthat what could not be so restored, should be held under the\r\ntitle _precaria_, at fixed rentals, till they could again be\r\ntransferred to the church. Pepin and Charlemagne used rigorous\r\nmeasures to secure that the holders, _in precario_, of\r\nchurch wealth should fulfil their obligations to its primitive\r\nproprietors; and we may gather, from the frequency of their\r\norders, that these orders were often treated with contempt. It is\r\nnevertheless evident that the practice of taking the goods of the\r\nchurch, and placing them in other hands, whether absolutely, or\r\nunder the title of precarious, continued under even the most\r\nfeeble and superstitious kings. The bishops said that Charles the\r\nBald suffered himself to be led astray, being often seduced,\r\npartly because of his youth, partly through feebleness of\r\ncharacter, by evil counsellors, and often constrained by the\r\nthreats of the occupants, who told him \"that if he did not allow\r\nthem to possess this consecrated property, they would abandon him\r\nimmediately.\" It is probable that but little of this property was\r\nrestored to the churches, and that the greater part of what was\r\nheld _sub precario_ became, along with the other benefices,\r\nthe hereditary possession of the occupants.\r\n\r\nWe see that far from Charles Martel having any claim to be\r\nregarded as the first originator of the practice of granting\r\nbenefices for life, the benefices, on the contrary, which arose\r\neither from the act by which he despoiled churches and\r\nmonasteries, or from acts similar to his, were for a long time\r\nmore precarious than any others, and even ought legally to have\r\nbeen restored to the churches; certainly at the death of the\r\noccupants, and if possible before.\r\n\r\n{119}\r\n\r\nIII. We find during the whole of the epoch which we are\r\nconsidering, and at its close as much as at its commencement,\r\nbenefices conferred for life. It is evident that under Pepin and\r\nCharlemagne most benefices were given on this tenure. This was\r\nowing to the various precautions taken by the kings to prevent\r\ntheir being transformed into allodial estates. Louis the\r\nDebonnair took the same precautions. Mabillon quotes a charter of\r\nthis king containing the formal concession of a benefice to be\r\nheld for life. In 889, King Eudes conferred a benefice on Ricabod\r\nhis vassal, \"in beneficiary right, and on a tenure of usufruct;\"\r\nwith this addition, that, if he should have a son, the benefice\r\nshould pass to his son for his life. We see, under Pepin, a\r\nvassal die who had a son, and yet his benefice was given\r\nimmediately to another vassal.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Hereditary Benefices.\r\n\r\nIV. We find also, during the whole of this epoch, that benefices\r\nwere given or held hereditarily. In 587, it was stipulated by the\r\ntreaty of Andely, with regard to the concessions made by queen\r\nClotilda, that they should be perpetual. The law of the Visigoths\r\n(of Chindasuinth, about 540) provides that the concessions made\r\nby the princes should not be revoked. Marculf gives the formulary\r\nfor a hereditary concession. In 765, Charlemagne gave to an\r\nindividual named Jean, who had conquered the Saracens in the\r\nprovince of Barcelona, a domain (says Fontaines) situated near\r\nNarbonne; \"in order that he and his posterity may possess it\r\nwithout any fee or trouble, so long as they remain faithful to us\r\nor to our children.\" The same Jean presented himself to Louis the\r\nDebonnair, with the gift of Charlemagne, and demanded his\r\nconfirmation of it. Louis confirmed it, and added to it new\r\nlands. In 884, Jean being dead, his son Teutfred presented\r\nhimself to Charles the Bald with the two donations just\r\nmentioned, and asked him to confirm them to him. The king granted\r\nthis, as it is expressed, \"in order that thou mayest possess\r\nthem, thou and thy posterity, without any fee.\" These successive\r\ndemands of confirmation, either at the death of the original\r\nbestower, or at that of the original incumbent, prove that the\r\nhereditary character of benefices was not then considered as a\r\nright, even when it had been promised, and consequently that it\r\nrested on no general law that was recognized by the state.\r\n\r\n{120}\r\n\r\n              Tenure Of Benefices.\r\n\r\nThese three modes of granting benefices, of which I have just\r\ngiven examples, existed therefore at the same time, and I believe\r\nthat we may assert from them two general facts, which however are\r\nnot without exceptions: _First_, the usual condition of\r\nbenefices, during this period, was that they should be given on a\r\ntenure of usufruct and for life; _Secondly_, the tendency of\r\nthe time was to render the benefice a hereditary possession. This\r\nresult was eventually realized when the feudal or aristocratic\r\nsystem triumphed over the monarchical system. We see under\r\nCharlemagne, at which time the monarchical system reached its\r\nculminating point, that most benefices were held on a tenure of\r\nusufruct for life, and not as personal property. Not only was\r\nCharlemagne unwilling that the property in benefices should be\r\nusurped, but he was especially vigilant with regard to their\r\nright administration. Under Charles the Bald, when the\r\naristocratic system prevailed, benefices came to be held as\r\nhereditary possessions. This mode of possession partly arose out\r\nof the immense number of hereditary concessions which were made\r\nduring this reign, and which were commenced under Louis the\r\nDebonnair; partly also out of some general arrangements in the\r\ncapitularies of Charles the Bald, which recognized or conferred\r\nupon those who were faithful to the king the right to transmit\r\ntheir benefices hereditarily. We must conclude from this that the\r\nhereditary character of benefices at that time prevailed almost\r\nuniversally as a custom, and began to be avowed as a principle,\r\nbut that it was not yet a general and recognized right. It was\r\ndemanded and received in individual instances, which would not\r\nhave been the case had it existed as a common right. In the\r\nmonarchies consequent on the dismemberment of Charlemagne's\r\nempire--in Germany, for example--it was not recognized as a\r\nright, and prevailed still less as a custom.\r\n\r\nLet us never forget--I repeat it--that all these general facts\r\nare subject to exceptional cases, and that different methods of\r\nconferring benefices have existed at all times. It would follow,\r\nfrom the nature of things, that the common condition of benefices\r\nwas, at first, that of possession for life. The relations of the\r\nchief to his associates were all personal,--hence his\r\nbenefactions were personal also.\r\n{121}\r\nNot less did it follow from the nature of things, that when the\r\nFranks were once established and fixed, the associates of the\r\nmonarch who were able to acquire an independent existence, and to\r\nbecome powerful in their turn, tended to separate themselves from\r\ntheir ancient chief, and to settle themselves in their own\r\npossessions, in order that they also might become the centre of\r\ngroups of men. Hence resulted all the efforts to make benefices\r\nhereditary.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Conditions Attached To Benefices.\r\n\r\nAfter having determined the origin and the mode of conferring and\r\ntransmitting benefices, it remains that we should learn what\r\nconditions were attached to them, and what relations were thereby\r\nformed between the giver and the incumbent.\r\n\r\nMably thinks that benefices did not at first impose any\r\nparticular obligation, and that those of Charles Martel were the\r\nfirst which were formally associated with civil and military\r\nservices. This opinion is contrary to the nature of things;--the\r\norigin of benefices testifies to the contrary. They were, as, in\r\nGermany, gifts of horses or of arms and banquets had been, a mode\r\nof attaching companies to the benefactor. This relation in itself\r\ninvolves an obligation. Mably's idea is equally contradicted by\r\nfacts. In all the disputes which arose between the incumbents and\r\nthe Merovingian kings, the benefices are always vindicated in\r\nbehalf of those who kept faith with their patron. No complaints\r\nwere made when those were seen to be despoiled who had failed to\r\nrender the fidelity that was due from them. Siggo we find losing\r\nthe benefices of Chilperic in 576, because he had forsaken his\r\nallegiance and passed over to Childebert II. The law of the\r\nRipuarians pronounced the confiscation of the goods of every man\r\nwho had been unfaithful to the king. Marculf gives the formula of\r\nthe act by which a man was received into the number of the\r\nfaithful. Charles Martel, in giving benefices to his soldiers,\r\nonly imposed upon them the obligations that had always followed\r\non such appointments. Only these obligations became progressively\r\nmore formal and explicit, precisely in the measure that the\r\nancient relations of the chief and his associates tended to\r\nbecome weakened and to disappear, in consequence of the\r\ndispersion of his men and their settlement on their own\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\n{122}\r\n\r\n              Vassalage.\r\n\r\nOriginally, the associates lived with their chief, around him, in\r\nhis house and at his table, in peace, as well as in war: they\r\nwere his vassals, according to the original sense of the word,\r\nwhich signified the _guest_, the _companion_, an\r\nindividual attached to the house. [Footnote 13]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 13: There are different etymologies of the word\r\n    _vassus_, from _haus_, a house; from _gast_, a\r\n    guest; from _fest_, fast, established; from\r\n    _geselle_ (vassallus). The word _Gasinde_, which\r\n    expresses the _familia_, so far as it comprises the\r\n    individuals inhabiting the house, the _guests_ in\r\n    opposition to the _mancipia_, induces me to think that\r\n    _vassus_ comes from _gast_. (Anton, _Gesch. der\r\n    Deuts. Land._, vol. i. p. 526.)\r\n\r\n    We read in the Salic law (tit. 43): _Si quis romanum\r\n    hominem convivam regis occiderit, sol. 300 culpabilis\r\n    judicetur_. The Roman editors of this law would have\r\n    rendered the word _gast_ by _conviva_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen most of the vassals had dispersed themselves, in order that\r\neach might reside in his own allodial or beneficiary estate, we\r\nmay easily perceive the necessity that thus arose of determining\r\nthe obligations that were then imposed upon them; but this was\r\nonly done imperfectly and by degrees, as is generally the case\r\nwhere matters are at issue which have for a long time had a\r\ngeneral and conventional adjustment. As the first race began to\r\ndisappear and the second to arise in its place, the obligations\r\nattached to the conferring of benefices appear to be clearly\r\ndetermined. They range themselves under two principal heads.\r\n_First_, the obligation of military service on the\r\nrequisition of the patron. _Secondly_, the obligation of\r\ncertain judicial and domestic services of a more personal and\r\nhousehold character. It is impossible at the present time to\r\nspecify what these services were to which the incumbents were\r\nheld. We see only, among a host of acts, that the kings imposed\r\non the incumbents _servilia_, which obliged them to present\r\nthemselves at court. These obligations were comprised under the\r\ngeneral term _fidelity_. They were at first personal, and\r\nattached to the quality of _liege-man,_ independently of the\r\npossession of any benefice; a connexion identical with that\r\nbetween the ancient German associates and their monarch. When it\r\nhad become necessary for the king to give lands as a benefice, in\r\norder to insure the fidelity of his liege subjects, the\r\nobligation attached itself to the quality of beneficiary. We\r\nconstantly see benefices given under the condition of loyalty.\r\nCharlemagne, when he gave a benefice in perpetuity to Jean,\r\nannexed to it this condition.\r\n{123}\r\nThere is reason to believe that benefices were also given,\r\nconditioned by the payment of certain fees (_census_). I do\r\nnot find, at this period, the granting of any benefice in which\r\nthe imposition of a rental is expressly indicated; but the nature\r\nof things seems to show that such must have been the case, and I\r\ndo find mention made of benefices conferred _absque ullo\r\ncensu_. Anxiety in certain cases to obtain exemption from the\r\nfees, proves that in other cases they were imposed. It is\r\nprobable that rentals were attached to benefices, granted\r\nhereditarily, and not to those which were only given for the term\r\nof an individual life.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Oaths Of Fidelity.\r\n\r\nLoyalty was at first due only to that chief to whom it had been\r\nexpressly promised, and from whom a benefice had been received.\r\nCharlemagne attempted to change this into an obligation common to\r\nall the freemen in his States. Marculf has preserved to us the\r\nformula in which he wrote to his counts, requiring from all\r\nindividuals the oath of fidelity. Thus did this prince endeavour\r\nto break through the feudal hierarchy which was consolidating\r\nitself, to bring himself into a direct relation with all freemen,\r\nand to make the relation between king and subject predominant\r\nover that between lord and vassal. The oath of fidelity was\r\nuniversally exacted by the successors of Charlemagne, Louis the\r\nDebonnair and Charles the Bald, but without any effective\r\nresults; for the tendency to hierarchical and feudal aristocracy\r\nhad become prevalent. We find besides numerous examples of the\r\nmaintenance of the relations between incumbent and patron, even\r\nunder Charlemagne. Under Charles the Bald this relation became\r\nmore positive and independent of the king. The prince even, for\r\nthe repression of public crimes, allowed his authority to be\r\nexercised through the intervention of the lord; he made each lord\r\nresponsible for the crimes of his own dependents. It was\r\ntherefore especially in the empire of the lord over his men, that\r\nthe means were then sought of sustaining order and repressing\r\ncrime. This alone will sufficiently indicate the continually\r\ngrowing force of feudal relations and the diminishing authority\r\nof royalty.\r\n\r\n{124}\r\n\r\n              Lecture XV.\r\n\r\n  Of benefices conceded by great landowners to men dependent\r\n  upon them:\r\n\r\n    _First_, benefices conceded for all kinds of services,\r\n    and as a mode of paying salary;\r\n\r\n    _Secondly_, larger proprietors usurp the lands adjoining\r\n    their own, and bestow them as benefices on their\r\n    subordinates;\r\n\r\n    _Thirdly_, the conversion of a great number of allodial\r\n    lands into benefices, by the practice of\r\n    _recommendation_.\r\n\r\n  Origin and meaning of this practice.\r\n\r\n  Permanence of freeholds, especially in certain parts of the\r\n  Frankish monarchy.\r\n\r\n  Tributary lands.\r\n\r\n  Their origin and nature.\r\n\r\n  Their rapid extension: its causes.\r\n\r\n  General view of the condition of territorial\r\n  property, from the sixth to the eleventh century:\r\n\r\n    _First_, different conditions of territorial property;\r\n\r\n    _Secondly_, the individual dependence of territorial\r\n    property;\r\n\r\n    _Thirdly_, the stationary condition of territorial\r\n    wealth.\r\n\r\n  Why the system of beneficiary property, that is to say, the\r\n  feudal system, was necessary to the formation of modern society\r\n  and of powerful states.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Donors Of Benefices.\r\n\r\nKings were not the sole donors of benefices; all the large\r\nproprietors gave them. Many leaders of bands of men were\r\noriginally united under the conduct of the king; these chiefs\r\nbecame subsequently proprietors of large allodial estates.\r\nPortions of these were conceded as benefices to their immediate\r\nassociates. Afterwards, they became large incumbents, and gave\r\nalso as benefices portions of the benefice which they held from\r\nthe king. Hence arose the practice of sub-enfeoffment. In the\r\ncapitularies, we perpetually meet with the words, _vassalli\r\nvassallorum nostrorum_.\r\n\r\nWe find, during the whole of this period, even under Charlemagne,\r\nnumerous examples of benefices held otherwise than from the king.\r\nTwo letters of Eginhard expressly mention the concession, by way\r\nof benefice, of certain portions of royal benefices.\r\n\r\nIt is the opinion of Mably, that other persons than the king\r\nbegan to give benefices only after the reign of Charles Martel.\r\nThis mistake arises from his not having apprehended that the\r\nrelation of the chief to his associate, which afterwards grew\r\ninto that of lord to his vassal, was at first a purely personal\r\nrelation, entirely independent of and anterior to any concession\r\nof benefices.\r\n{125}\r\nIt is impossible to determine at what particular time the\r\nconferring of benefices became connected with the relation of the\r\nbeneficiary to his patron. This was probably almost immediately\r\nafter the territorial establishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Character Of Benefices.\r\n\r\nThe number of benefices was soon very considerable, and became\r\ngreater every day.\r\n\r\nI. Benefices were given to free men belonging to quite an\r\ninferior order, and employed in subordinate services. The\r\n_majores villæ_, and the _poledrarii_, that is to say,\r\nthe stewards of the estates, and the keepers of the horses of\r\nCharlemagne, had them. It was the policy of this prince to\r\nscatter widely his gifts, and to reward zeal and fidelity\r\nwherever he found them.\r\n\r\nII. The larger proprietors continually made themselves masters of\r\nthe lands adjoining their own, whether these were lands belonging\r\nto the royal domain, or such as were neglected, and had no very\r\ndefinite owners. They had them cultivated, and often procured\r\nsubsequently the privilege of adding them to their benefices. The\r\nextent of this abuse becomes manifest under Charles the Bald, by\r\nthe numerous expedients adopted by this prince to remedy it.\r\n\r\nIII. A large number of allods were converted into benefices by\r\nmeans of a tolerably ancient usage. Marculf has left us the\r\nformula by which this conversion was made; its origin we must\r\nseek in the practice of _recommendation_. Recommendation was\r\nnot primitively anything else than the choice of a chief, or a\r\npatron. A law of the Visigoths, called a _lex antiqua_, and\r\nwhich must be referred to king Euric, towards the close of the\r\nfifth century, says: \"If any one have given arms, or any other\r\nthing, to a man whom he has taken under his patronage, these\r\ngifts shall remain the property of him by whom they have been\r\nreceived. If this latter choose another patron, he shall be free\r\nto _recommend_ himself to whomsoever he will: this may not\r\nbe forbidden to a free man, for he belongeth to himself; but he\r\nshall, in this case, return to the patron from whom he separates\r\nhimself all that he has received from him.\"\r\n\r\n{126}\r\n\r\nThese were, then, the ancient Germanic customs. The relation of\r\nthe individual _recommended_ to his patron was a purely\r\npersonal one. The presents consisted in arms; his liberty\r\nremained unimpaired. The law of the Lombards left to every one\r\nthe same liberty as the law of the Visigoths. Nevertheless, we\r\nsee, by the same capitulary, that this liberty began to be\r\nrestrained. Charlemagne defined the reasons by which any one\r\nmight be allowed to quit his lord, when he had received anything\r\nfrom him. We may learn from this, that the ties contracted by\r\nrecommendation began to be strengthened. This practice became\r\nvery frequent. By these means order was promoted, so far as the\r\nlaw was concerned, and protection and safety as far as concerned\r\nthe person recommended. When relations of service and protection\r\nbearing a purely personal character were thus established with a\r\npatron, other more tangible relations arose in which the property\r\nof the parties was considered. The person recommended received\r\nbenefices from the lord, and became a vassal of his estate; or\r\nrather he recommended his lands, as he had previously recommended\r\nhis person. _Recommendation_ thus became a part of the\r\nfeudal system, and it contributed most importantly to the\r\nconversion of allodial estates into benefices.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, no reason to believe that all allods were thus\r\nconverted into benefices. Originally, such a conversion, or even\r\nthe mere acceptance of a benefice, was regarded by a free man as,\r\nto a certain extent, a surrender of his liberty, being an\r\nentrance upon a personal service. The large proprietors, who\r\nexercised an almost absolute sovereignty in their own domains,\r\nwould not readily renounce their proud independence. Etichon,\r\nbrother to Judith the wife of Louis the Debonnair, was unwilling\r\nany longer to receive his son Henry, who had accepted, without\r\nhis knowledge, from the king his uncle a benefice of four hundred\r\nacres, and thereby entered upon the service of the crown. After\r\nthe triumph of the feudal system, a considerable number of allods\r\nstill remained in several provinces, particularly in Languedoc.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Tributary Lands.\r\n\r\nAfter speaking of freeholds and benefices, it remains that I\r\nshould allude to the tributary lands, whose existence is attested\r\nby all the memorials of this period. We do not necessarily\r\nunderstand by this term lands on which a public impost was\r\nlevied, but lands which paid a fee, a rental, to a superior, and\r\nwhich were not the actual and absolute property of those who\r\ncultivated them.\r\n\r\n{127}\r\n\r\n              Their Rapid Increase.\r\n\r\nThis kind of property existed in Gaul before the invasion\r\nof the Franks. The conquest that resulted from this invasion\r\ncontributed in various ways to augment their number.\r\n_First_, wherever a Barbarian possessed of some amount of\r\npower established himself, he did not take possession of all the\r\nlands, but he most probably exacted certain fees, or services\r\nequivalent to them, from almost all whose lands bordered on his\r\nown. This is certain from _à priori_ considerations, and is\r\nproved as a fact by the example of the Lombards, who invariably\r\ncontented themselves at first with rendering all the lands of the\r\nconquered country tributary to themselves. They demanded a third\r\nof the revenue, and afterwards took the property itself. This\r\nfact shows clearly the mode of procedure that was adopted by the\r\nBarbarians. Almost all the lands possessed by Roman or Gallic\r\nchiefs, who did not possess sufficient power to rank with the\r\nBarbarians, were obliged to submit to a tributary condition.\r\n\r\n_Secondly_, conquest was not the work of a single day; it\r\ncontinued to be carried on after the establishment of the\r\ninvaders. All the documents of the period indicate that the\r\nprincipal officers and large proprietors continually exerted\r\nthemselves, either to usurp the possessions of their less\r\npowerful neighbours, or to impose upon them rentals or other\r\ncharges. These usurpations are proved by the multitude of laws\r\nthat were enacted to prevent it. In the unsettled state of\r\nsociety that then existed, the feeble were entirely placed at the\r\ndisposal of the strong; public authority had become incompetent\r\nfor their protection; many lands which were at first free, and\r\nbelonged either to their ancient owners, or to Barbarians of\r\nslender resources, fell into a tributary state; many of the\r\nsmaller proprietors purchased for themselves the protection of\r\nthe strong, by voluntarily placing their lands in this condition.\r\nThe most common method of rendering lands tributary, was to give\r\nthem either to churches or to powerful proprietors, and then to\r\nreceive them again, on the tenure of usufruct, to be enjoyed\r\nduring life, on the payment of fixed fees. This kind of contract\r\nis to be met with again and again, during this period. The same\r\ncauses which tended to destroy allods, or to convert them into\r\nbenefices, acted with even more energy in augmenting the number\r\nof tributary lands.\r\n\r\n{128}\r\n\r\n_Thirdly_, many large proprietors, whether of allodial lands\r\nor of benefices, were unable themselves to cultivate the whole of\r\ntheir lands, and gave them up by small portions to simple\r\ncultivators, on the payment of certain fees and services. This\r\nalienation took place under a multitude of forms and a variety of\r\ncircumstances; it certainly occasioned many lands to become\r\ntributary. The large number and endless variety of rentals and\r\nrights, known in a later time by the name of _feudal_, arose\r\nprobably either from similar contracts, or from usurpations\r\ncommitted by the powerful proprietors. The constant recurrence in\r\nwriters and laws of the period of the terms _census_ and\r\n_tributum_; the multitude of arrangements which relate to\r\nthem; the general course of events; lastly, the state in which\r\nmost landed property was found when order began to reappear,--all\r\nthese circumstances render it probable that at the end of the\r\nperiod we are considering, the greater number of lands had fallen\r\ninto a tributary condition. Property and liberty were alike\r\ndevoted to be plundered. Individuals were so isolated, and their\r\nforces so unequal, that nothing could prevent the results of such\r\na position.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Waste Lands.\r\n\r\nThe large number of waste lands, attested by the facility with\r\nwhich any one who was willing to cultivate them might obtain\r\nthem, bears witness in its turn also to the depopulation of the\r\ncountry, and the deplorable condition in which property existed.\r\nThe concentration of landed property is a decisive proof of this\r\nstate of things. When this kind of property is safe and\r\nprosperous, it tends to become divided, because every one desires\r\nto possess it. When, on the other hand, we see it accumulated\r\nmore and more in the same hands, we may almost certainly conclude\r\nthat it is in an unsound condition, that the feeble cannot\r\nsustain themselves upon it, and that the strong alone can defend\r\nit. Landed property, like moveable property, is only to be found\r\nwhere it can continue to exist in safety.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that most tributary lands, even those\r\nwhich were not originally the property of the cultivators who\r\nlaboured on them, became at length by a right of occupancy in\r\nreality their possessions, though burdened by rentals and\r\nexactions of service. This is the natural course of things: it is\r\nvery difficult to remove a cultivator who has with his family for\r\na long time tilled the same soil.\r\n\r\n{129}\r\n\r\n         Different Kinds Of Landed Property.\r\n\r\nSuch were the vicissitudes of landed property, from the sixth to\r\nthe eleventh century. I will now give a summary view of the\r\ngeneral characteristics of this state of things, and endeavour to\r\nestimate their influence on the progress of general civilization,\r\nand more particularly of political institutions.\r\n\r\nI. There was a great diversity in the conditions of property. In\r\nour days, the condition of property is uniform and everywhere the\r\nsame; whoever the proprietor may be, he possesses his property,\r\nwhatever may be its character, on the same tenure of right, and\r\nsubject to the same laws as any other. Between properties which\r\nare the most distinct in character, there is thus far an\r\nidentity. This is one of the most unequivocal symptoms and safest\r\nguarantees of the progress of legal equality. During the times of\r\nwhich we have been speaking, the diversified conditions under\r\nwhich property was held would necessarily lead to the formation\r\nof several classes in society, between which existed great,\r\nfactitious, and permanent inequality. Men were not merely\r\nproprietors to a greater or less extent; besides the inequality\r\nin the amount of wealth, there was also an inequality in the\r\nnature of the wealth possessed, than which it is impossible to\r\nconceive of a more powerful instrument for oppression. Even this,\r\nhowever, was a step in advance out of the slavery existing among\r\nthe ancients. The slave could possess nothing,--was essentially\r\nincapable of owning property. In the times of which I am\r\nspeaking, the mass of the population had not become full and\r\nabsolute possessors of property, but was attaining to a\r\npossession that was more or less imperfect and precarious, by\r\nwhich it had gained the means of yet loftier ascents.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Isolation Of Proprietors.\r\n\r\nII. Landed property was then submitted to the restraints of\r\ndependence on individuals. At present, all property is free, and\r\nis at the disposal only of its owner. General society has been\r\nformed,--the State has been organized,--every proprietor is\r\nunited to his fellow-citizens by a multitude of ties and\r\nrelations, and to the state by the protection which he receives\r\nfrom it, and the taxes to which he is subject in return: there\r\nis, thus, independence without isolation.\r\n{130}\r\nFrom the sixth to the eleventh century, independence was\r\nnecessarily accompanied by isolation: the proprietor of an allod\r\nlived upon his lands almost without buying or selling anything.\r\nHe owed scarcely anything to a State which hardly existed, and\r\nwhich could not assure him of an efficient protection. The\r\ncondition, therefore, of the allods and their proprietors was at\r\nthat time a con that was to a considerable extent anti-social. In\r\nmore ancient times, in the forests of Germany, men without landed\r\nproperties lived at least in common. When they became\r\nproprietors, if the allodial system had succeeded in becoming\r\nprevalent, the chiefs and their associates would have been\r\nseparated, without ever being summoned to meet and recognize one\r\nanother as citizens. Society would not have been at all\r\nconstituted. It exists in those relations which unite men\r\ntogether, and in the ties out of which these relations arise. It\r\nnecessarily demands a law, a condition of dependence. And when it\r\nis not so far advanced as that a sufficient number of these\r\nrelations and ties have been established between the State and\r\nthe individual, then individuals become dependent one upon\r\nanother; and it was to this state of things that the seventh\r\ncentury had arrived. It was the imperfection of society which\r\ncaused the allodial system in regard to landed property to\r\nperish, and the beneficiary or tributary system to prevail. The\r\nindependence of allods could only exist in connexion with their\r\nisolation, and isolation is anti-social. The hierarchical\r\ndependence of benefices became the tie to unite properties with\r\none another, and society within itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Stationary Condition Of Wealth.\r\n\r\nIII. Out of this distribution and this character of landed\r\nproperty, a very important fact has resulted; namely, that during\r\nseveral centuries scarcely any means existed by which either the\r\nstate or individuals could increase their wealth. Most\r\nproprietors of any importance did not cultivate the land at all;\r\nit was for them merely a capital, the revenues of which they\r\ngathered without troubling themselves to augment it, or to render\r\nit more productive. On the other side, most of those who\r\ncultivated the land were not proprietors, or were only so in a\r\nprecarious and imperfect manner; they did not seek from the earth\r\nmore than means of subsistence, and did not look to it as a means\r\nof enriching or elevating them.\r\n{131}\r\nAgricultural labour was almost unknown to the rich, and to the\r\npoor it yielded nothing beyond the bare necessities of existence.\r\n'Hence, resulted the continual impoverishment of the larger\r\nproprietors, which forced them incessantly to have recourse to\r\nviolence, in order to preserve their fortune and their rank.\r\nHence, resulted also, at the same time, that stationary condition\r\nof the population of the country districts which was prolonged\r\nfor so long a period. Landed property tended always to become\r\nconcentrated, from the very circumstance that its products did\r\nnot increase. Accordingly, it is not in the country districts and\r\nin agricultural labour, but in the towns, in their commerce and\r\nindustry, that we shall find the earliest germs of the\r\naccumulation of public wealth, and of the progress of\r\ncivilization. The indolence of the upper classes, and the misery\r\nof the lower classes, in the middle ages, proceeded chiefly from\r\nthe nature and distribution of territorial property.\r\n\r\nIV. Beneficiary property was one of the most influential\r\nprinciples in the formation of large societies. In the absence of\r\npublic assemblies and of a central despotism, it nevertheless\r\nestablished a bond, and formed relations between men dispersed\r\nover a vast tract of country, and thereby rendered possible a\r\nfederative hierarchy, which should embrace a still wider circle.\r\nAmong the nations of antiquity, the extension of the State was\r\nincompatible with the progress of civilization; either the State\r\nmust be dislocated, or despotism would prevail. Modern States\r\nhave presented a different spectacle, and to this result the\r\ncharacter of beneficiary property has powerfully contributed.\r\n\r\n{132}\r\n\r\n              Lecture XVI.\r\n\r\n Of the state of persons, from the fifth to the tenth century.\r\n\r\n  Impossibility of determining this, according to any fixed and\r\n  general principle.\r\n\r\n  The condition of lands not always correspondent with that of\r\n  persons.\r\n\r\n  Variable and unsettled character of social conditions.\r\n\r\n  Slavery.\r\n\r\n  Attempt to determine the condition of persons according to\r\n  the _Wehrgeld_.\r\n\r\n  Table of twenty-one principal cases of _Wehrgeld_.\r\n\r\n  Uncertainty of this principle.\r\n\r\n  The true method of ascertaining the condition of persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n            Classification Of Persons.\r\n\r\nWe have investigated the condition of territorial properties,\r\nfrom the fifth to the tenth centuries. We have recognized three\r\nkinds of territorial property. _First_, allodial or\r\nindependent; _Secondly_, beneficiary; _Thirdly_,\r\ntributary. If from this we should wish to deduce the state of\r\npersons, we should find three social conditions corresponding to\r\nthese: _First_, the free men, or proprietors of allods,\r\nbound to, and dependent upon no one, excepting the general laws\r\nof the state; _Secondly_, vassals, or proprietors of\r\nbenefices, dependent in certain respects upon the noble from whom\r\nthey held their property, either during life or hereditarily;\r\n_Thirdly_, the proprietors of tributary lands, who were\r\nsubject to certain special obligations. To which it is necessary\r\nto add a fourth class, namely, the serfs.\r\n\r\nWe should observe further, that the first of these classes tended\r\nto disappear and become absorbed in the second, third, and even\r\nthe fourth classes. This arose from facts which we have already\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\nThis classification of persons is in fact a real one, and is to\r\nbe met with in history; but we must not regard it as a primitive,\r\ngeneral, and perfectly regular classification.\r\n\r\nThe condition of persons preceded that of lands;--there were free\r\nmen before there were freeholds; there were vassals and\r\nassociates before benefices. The condition and relations of\r\npersons did not therefore originally depend on the condition and\r\nrelations of territorial properties, and cannot be deduced from\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n{133}\r\n\r\n         Earliest Condition Of Society.\r\n\r\nHistorians have fallen into a double mistake on this point. Some\r\nhave wished to see in all the Franks, before the conquest, and\r\nthe establishment of the system of landed estates, which we have\r\nalready explained, men altogether free and equal, whose liberty\r\nand equality for a long time resisted the formation of this\r\nsystem. Others have been unwilling to recognize men as free,\r\nexcept as they are beheld in the condition of land proprietors,\r\nwhether as allods or as benefices.\r\n\r\nThe matter is not thus simple and absolute. Social conditions\r\nwere not thus framed and disposed of by a single process, to suit\r\nthe convenience of subsequent antiquarians.\r\n\r\nWhat do we find to be the character of liberty in the infancy of\r\nsocieties? Might is its condition, and it has scarcely any other\r\nguarantee. So long as society is of small extent and firmly\r\ncompacted within itself, individual liberty remains, because each\r\nindividual is important to the society of which he is a member:\r\nthis was the case with the German tribes in its warrior bands of\r\nmen. In proportion as society extends and disperses itself, the\r\nliberty of individuals is endangered because their personal\r\nstrength is insufficient for their own protection. This was\r\nillustrated by the case of the Germans who established themselves\r\nin Gaul. A large number of his associates lived in the house of\r\nthe chief, without being themselves proprietors or being anxious\r\nto become so, for which indifference they were indebted to that\r\nwant of foresight which is natural to uncivilized men. Property\r\nbecame a prominent instrument for attaining force, yet many free\r\nmen did not possess any.\r\n\r\nThe progress of civilization removes the guarantee of individual\r\nliberty from the power of the individual himself, and places it\r\nin the power of the community. But the very creation of such a\r\npublic power, and the guarantee thereby of individual liberties,\r\nis a gradual and difficult process: it results from a social\r\nculture which is of slow growth and must triumph over many\r\nobstructions. Wherever there is no power belonging to the\r\ncommunity, individual liberties have no guarantee for their\r\ncontinuance.\r\n\r\nHence the error of those who seek for liberty in the infancy of\r\nsocieties. We do in fact find it there, but only when society is\r\nquite in its cradle, when each separate individual is\r\nsufficiently strong to be able to defend his own liberty in a\r\nvery limited community. But as soon as society rises and extends\r\nitself, we see this liberty perish; the inequality of different\r\nforces manifests itself, and individual power becomes incapable\r\nof preserving individual liberty. This is the birth-time of\r\noppression and disorder.\r\n\r\n{134}\r\n\r\n         Principles Of Classification.\r\n\r\nSuch was the condition of the Franco-Roman community, at the\r\nperiod which we are considering. It seems somewhat puerile to\r\ninquire who was free then; no one was free, whatever his origin\r\nmight be, if he was not strong. The real inquiry is, who was\r\nstrong--a point which it is exceedingly difficult to determine.\r\n\r\nIn a fully settled society which has existed for a long time, it\r\nis easy to know who is strong. There is a constant transmission\r\nof properties and of ancient influences; power has permanent\r\nforms, men are classified. We see where strength resides and who\r\npossesses it. But at the time which we are considering, the\r\nvarious elements of social strength were struggling into\r\nexistence;--they scarcely had a being, and they were not\r\nfamiliarly known, nor stably fixed, or in regular possession of\r\npower;--the violent customs which prevailed rendered property\r\nvery moveable;--individual strength was a poor guarantee for\r\nliberty, indeed, it needed itself to be placed in guardianship.\r\n\r\nThe human mind can hardly believe in disorder, because it cannot\r\npicture clearly to itself such a state of things; it does not\r\nresign itself to the idea; it desires to introduce an order of\r\nits own, in order to discover the light. We must, however, accept\r\nfacts as they actually are. We may therefore understand how\r\ndifficult it is to exhibit the condition of men, from the fifth\r\nto the tenth centuries; to learn what men were free, and who were\r\nnot, and especially what a free man really was in his position\r\nand influence. We shall understand this difficulty still better\r\nwhen we have attempted to determine the condition of life\r\nbelonging to certain positions, according to the different\r\nprinciples of classification which we may bring to the task. We\r\nshall see that no one principle can be found, by which we can\r\ndeduce the state belonging to different positions in a manner\r\nexactly conformable to known facts, and which is not contradicted\r\nat every step by these same facts, or at least shown by them to\r\nbe utterly insufficient and untrustworthy.\r\n\r\nLet us first apply the principle which is inferred from the state\r\nof landed property.\r\n\r\n{135}\r\n\r\n         Allodial And Beneficiary Proprietors.\r\n\r\nThe proprietors of allods might seem to be incontestably free\r\nmen. An allodial proprietor who had extensive estates enjoyed\r\ncomplete independence, and wielded an almost absolute sovereignty\r\nthroughout his territory, and among his associates.\r\n\r\nLarge allodial proprietors were sometimes able to remain for a\r\nconsiderable time in such a position. But it was not certainly\r\nthe strongest, nor consequently the most free and fixed\r\ncondition; for we have seen that allodial property degenerated\r\nand declined, until almost all the allodial proprietors became\r\nbeneficiaries. We have seen how the anger of Etichon was excited.\r\nThe general fact is a witness against the life of the allodial\r\nproprietor. His very independence was a cause of isolation, and\r\ntherefore of feebleness. The proprietors of allods, wearied with\r\nliving on their estates, shut out from all society, used to come\r\nand live with the king or some large proprietor of greater power\r\nthan themselves. It was soon a practice to send their children\r\nthither, in order that they might become companions of the\r\nprince, or of some distinguished noble.\r\n\r\nAs to the smaller allodial proprietors, they could not keep their\r\nstanding long; they were not strong enough to defend their\r\nindependence. The records of the period show that their property\r\nwas soon alienated, and at the same time many of them became\r\nmerely cultivators of the lands. The condition of the freeholder\r\nthus became merged in that of the tributary. From thence there\r\nwas but one step to a total loss of liberty. This step was\r\nactually taken by a large number of allodial proprietors--wearied\r\nout or ruined, they surrendered their liberty into the hands of\r\nproprietors more wealthy and powerful than themselves.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the beneficiaries.\r\n\r\nBenefices originated large individual resources;--in them we find\r\nthe source of the feudal aristocracy;--large beneficiaries became\r\nin time powerful nobles. But we must not from this conclude that\r\nthe possession of benefices was, during the period we are\r\nconsidering, any security for a permanent social position, to\r\nwhich power and liberty necessarily belonged. _First_, this\r\npossession was precarious, moveable, attacked, in the case of the\r\nsmaller beneficiaries, by the larger ones, and in the case of the\r\nlatter by the king.\r\n{136}\r\nBeneficiary property hardly began to possess any fixity at the\r\nclose of the ninth century. _Secondly_, a number of small\r\nbenefices were conferred on individuals too weak efficiently to\r\ndefend their position and their liberty. In order to secure the\r\nservices of a man who was not a slave, a benefice was given to\r\nhim--it was therefore a grant for the support of a retainer. The\r\nland itself was given for this purpose, as well as its\r\nproductions. The benefices given to Charlemagne's stewards and\r\nthe keepers of his horse were actual benefices, and not, as M. de\r\nMontlosier thinks, tributary lands. We are not then in a position\r\nto say that the rank of a beneficiary was the sign of a\r\ndefinitely marked social position, nor that it could measure the\r\ndegree of importance and of freedom that belonged to individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n          Various Classes Of Free Men.\r\n\r\nWhen we have mentioned the allodial proprietors and the\r\nbeneficiaries, it might be thought that the class of freemen is\r\nexhausted. Such is not, however, the case. There were different\r\nclasses of possessors and farmers of tributary lands, known under\r\nvarious names; such as _fiscalini, fiscales, tributarii,\r\ncoloni, lidi, aldi, aldiones,_ &c. These names do not all\r\ndesignate different conditions, but divers shades in conditions\r\nsubstantially the same. There were: _First_, free men, at\r\nonce allodial proprietors and cultivators; _Secondly_, free\r\nmen, both proprietors of benefices and cultivators;\r\n_Thirdly_, free men, neither properly freeholders nor\r\nbeneficiaries, and cultivators; _Fourthly_, men not free, to\r\nwhom the hereditary possession of tributary land had been granted\r\non the payment of certain fees and services; _Fifthly_, men\r\nnot free, who only enjoyed the permanent occupancy of tributary\r\nland. Here again we cannot find any general and fixed social\r\ncondition which shall determine what were the rank, the rights,\r\nand other qualifications of the individuals belonging to it. We\r\nare mistaken if we imagine either that every proprietor was free,\r\nor that every free man was a proprietor. We find that the\r\ncultivators of lands under the king harassed and oppressed the\r\nsmaller allodial proprietors who resided in their vicinity, and\r\nwere too feeble to oppose any effectual resistance, although they\r\nwere Franks.\r\n\r\n{137}\r\n\r\nI need only mention slaves, in order to observe that many free\r\nmen fell into this state of servitude by means of violence, and\r\nthrough an uncertainty in property which involved a corresponding\r\nuncertainty in position. Sometimes one man would surrender\r\nhimself to his more powerful neighbour, and at the same time\r\ncompletely abandon his liberty. The surrender, however, was\r\nsometimes not an entire renouncement of liberty, although it was\r\nalienated for life, or a sum was agreed upon to be paid if the\r\nengagement should be broken.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Test Of Social Conditions.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that we cannot derive, from the state and the\r\ndistribution of territorial properties, any true and fixed table\r\nof different social conditions, and of the importance of the\r\nrights belonging to each. These conditions were too undefined,\r\ntoo different, while nominally identical, and too fluctuating, to\r\ngive us a standard to measure the amount of liberty possessed by\r\neach man and the place he occupied in society. The state of\r\npersons was almost individual; the measure of the importance of\r\nany individual was determined by the particular amount of\r\nstrength which might belong to him, much more than by the general\r\nposition which he apparently occupied. Individuals constantly\r\npassed from one condition into another, neither losing all at\r\nonce every characteristic of the position which they left, nor\r\nassuming at once every characteristic of that upon which they\r\nnewly entered.\r\n\r\nLet us apply another principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n              The Wehrgeld\r\n\r\nAttempts have been made to determine the condition of\r\nindividuals, and to classify men according to the\r\n_wehrgeld;_ that is to say, according to the sum by which a\r\nman might compound for the commission of a murder, which was\r\nconsequently the measure of the valuation of different lives.\r\nShall we find here any more certain and unvarying principle by\r\nwhich social conditions may be classified?\r\n\r\nI have made an abstract of all the cases of  _wehrgeld_\r\nstipulated in the Barbaric laws. I will not enumerate them all,\r\nbut will bring before you twenty-one of the principal, ranging\r\nfrom the sum of 1800 _solidi_, the largest value that was\r\nlegally placed on any man's life, down to 20 _solidi_.\r\n\r\nThe _wehrgeld_ amounted to:--\r\n\r\n  1800 sol. _(solidi_): for the murder of a free barbarian,\r\n  a companion of the king (_in truste regiâ_), attacked and\r\n  killed in his house by an ...\r\n\r\n  960 sol.: 1st. the duke, among the Bavarians; 2nd. the bishop,\r\n  among armed band, among the Salian Franks, the Germans.\r\n\r\n{138}\r\n\r\n  900 sol.: 1st. the bishop, among the Ripuarian Franks; 2nd. the\r\n  Roman, _in truste regiâ_, attacked and killed in his own\r\n  house by an armed band, among the Salian Franks.\r\n\r\n  640 sol.: the relatives of a duke, with the Barbarians.\r\n\r\n  600 sol.: 1st. every man _in truste regiâ_, with the\r\n  Ripuarians; 2nd. the same, with the Salian Franks, 3rd. the\r\n  count, with the Ripuarians; 4th. the priest, born free, with\r\n  the Ripuarians; 5th. the priest, with the Germans; 6th. the\r\n  count, with the Salian Franks; 7th. the _Sagibaro_ (a kind\r\n  of judge) free, _ibid._; 8th. the priest, _ibid_.;\r\n  the free man attacked and killed in his own house by an armed\r\n  band, _ibid_.\r\n\r\n  500 sol.: the deacon, with the Ripuarians.\r\n\r\n  400 sol.: 1st. the sub-deacon, with the Ripuarians; 2nd. the\r\n  deacon, with the Germans; 3rd. the same, among the Salian\r\n  Franks.\r\n\r\n  300 sol.: 1st. the Roman living with the king, with the Salian\r\n  Franks; 2nd. the young man brought up in the service of the\r\n  king, and those who had been enfranchised by the king, and made\r\n  counts, with the Ripuarians; 3rd. the priest, among the\r\n  Bavarians; 4th. the _Sagibaro_ who had been brought up in\r\n  the court of the king, with the Salian Franks; 5th. the Roman\r\n  killed by an armed band in his house, _ibid_.\r\n\r\n  200 sol.: the free-born clerk, with the Ripuarians; 2nd. the\r\n  deacon, with the Bavarians; 3rd. the free Ripuarian Frank; 4th.\r\n  the German of the middle classes; 5th. the Frank or Barbarian,\r\n  living under Salic law; 6th. the travelling Frank, with the\r\n  Ripuarians; 7th. the man who had become enfranchised by\r\n  purchase, with the Ripuarians.\r\n\r\n  160 sol.: 1st. the free man in general, among the Germans; 2nd.\r\n  the same, with the Bavarians; 3rd. the Burgundian, the German,\r\n  the Bavarian, the Frison, the Saxon, with the Ripuarians; 4th.\r\n  the free man cultivating ecclesiastical property, with the\r\n  Germans.\r\n\r\n  150 sol.: 1st. the _optimus_, or noble Burgundian, killed\r\n  by the man whom he had attacked; 2nd. the steward of a royal\r\n  domain, with the Burgundians; 3rd. the slave who could work\r\n  well in gold, _ibid_.\r\n\r\n  100 sol.: any man belonging to the middle classes (_mediocris\r\n  homo_) with the Burgundians, killed by the person whom he\r\n  had attacked; 2nd. the Roman possessing personal property, with\r\n  the Salian Franks; 3rd. the Roman while travelling, with the\r\n  Ripuarians; 4th. the man in the service of the king, or of a\r\n  church, _ibid_.; 5th. the planter (_lidus_) by two\r\n  charters of Charlemagne (an. 803 and 813); 6th. the steward\r\n  (_actor_) of a domain belonging to any but the king, with\r\n  the Burgundians; 7th. the slave, a worker in silver,\r\n  _ibid_.\r\n\r\n  80 sol.: those enfranchised in presence of the church, or by a\r\n  special charter, with the Germans.\r\n\r\n  75 sol.: any man of inferior condition (_minor persona_),\r\n  with the Burgundians.\r\n\r\n  55 sol.: the barbarian slave employed in the personal service\r\n  of a master, or as a bearer of messages, with the Burgundians.\r\n\r\n  50 sol.: the blacksmith (slave), with the Burgundians.\r\n\r\n  45 sol.: 1st. the serf of the church and the serf of the king,\r\n  with the Germans; 2nd. the tributary Roman, with the Salian\r\n  Franks.\r\n\r\n{139}\r\n\r\n  40 sol.: 1st. one merely enfranchised, with the Bavarians; 2nd.\r\n  the herdsman keeping forty swine, with the Germans; 3rd. the\r\n  shepherd over eighty sheep, _ibid_.; 4th. the seneschal of\r\n  the man who has twelve companions (_vassi_) in his house,\r\n  _ibid_.; 5th. the marshal who kept twelve horses,\r\n  _ibid_.; 6th. the cook who has an assistant\r\n  (_junior_), _ibid_.; 7th. the goldsmith,\r\n  _ibid_.; 8th. the armourer, _ibid_.; 9th. the\r\n  blacksmith, _ibid_.; 10th. the cartwright, with the\r\n  Burgundians.\r\n\r\n  36 sol.: 1st. the slave, with the Ripuarians; 2nd. the slave\r\n  who had become a tributary planter, _ibid_.\r\n\r\n  30 sol.: the keeper of swine, with the Burgundians.\r\n\r\n  20 sol.: the slave, with the Bavarians.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Impossibility Of Classification.\r\n\r\nWe see by this table, that, notwithstanding the common opinion to\r\nthe contrary, the _wehrgeld_ is by no means an exact and\r\ncertain indication of social conditions. It is not determined\r\nuniformly according to the origin, the quality, the position of\r\nindividuals. The circumstances of the murder, the official\r\ncharacter of the criminal, the greater or less usefulness or\r\ncommonness of the man slain, all these variable elements enter\r\ninto the determination of the _wehrgeld_. The simple fact of\r\nthe murder having been committed at the court of the duke, while\r\nthe victim is going to or returning from the house of the count,\r\ntriples the  _wehrgeld_ of every man, whether he be a slave\r\nor a freeman, a Barbarian or a Roman.  The elements of the\r\n_wehrgeld_ are very numerous; it varies according to places\r\nand times. The Roman, the tributary, the slave, according to\r\ncircumstances, may be valued at a greater or a less sum than a\r\nbarbarian free man. We see many general indications which serve\r\nto show that the Roman was commonly less esteemed than a\r\nbarbarian, the tributary or the slave less than the free man.\r\nThis is very easily accounted for, and might have been\r\nanticipated. But it is not on this account less difficult to draw\r\nfrom such facts a positive indication of the state of\r\nindividuals,--a precise and complete classification of social\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n           True Test Of Social Conditions.\r\n\r\nThere is no resource left but to renounce the idea of classifying\r\nsocial conditions, and of determining the condition of persons,\r\naccording to any general principle, resting either on the nature\r\nof territorial properties, or in the legal appreciation of the\r\nvalue of different lives. We must simply inquire, by the aid of\r\nhistorical facts, who were the strong and powerful at the time;\r\nwhat common name was given to them; what share of influence and\r\nof liberty fell to the lot of those who were simply called free\r\nmen.\r\n{140}\r\nWe shall thus arrive at clearer and more certain results. We\r\nshall often find that landed property is a great and principal\r\nsource of strength, and that the _wehrgeld_ is an indication\r\nof the amount of importance or of liberty possessed by\r\nindividuals; but we shall not attribute to these two principles a\r\ngeneral and decisive authority, and we shall not mutilate facts\r\nin order that they may harmonize with our hypotheses.\r\n\r\n{141}\r\n\r\n              Lecture XVII.\r\n\r\n  Of the _Leudes_ or _Antrustions_.\r\n\r\n  Men, faithful to the king and to the large proprietors.\r\n\r\n  Different means of acquiring and retaining them.\r\n\r\n  Obligations of the _Leudes_.\r\n\r\n  The _Leudes_ are the origin of the nobility.\r\n\r\n  Bishops and heads of monasteries were reckoned among the\r\n  _leudes_ of the king.\r\n\r\n  Moral and material power of the bishops.\r\n\r\n  Efforts of the kings to possess themselves of the right of\r\n  nominating bishops.\r\n\r\n  Free men.\r\n\r\n  Did they form a distinct and numerous class?\r\n\r\n  The _arimanni_, and _rathimburgi_.\r\n\r\n  Mistake of M. de Savigny.\r\n\r\n  Rapid and general extension of the feudal hierarchy.\r\n\r\n  The freedmen.\r\n\r\n  Different modes of enfranchisement:\r\n\r\n    _First_, the _denariales_, enfranchised with\r\n    respect to the king:\r\n\r\n    _Second_, the _tabularii_, enfranchised with\r\n    respect to the church:\r\n\r\n    _Third_, the _chartularii_, enfranchised by a\r\n    charter.\r\n\r\n    Different consequences resulting from these different modes\r\n    of enfranchisement.\r\n\r\n\r\n         The Leudes Or Antrustions.\r\n\r\nThe first whom we meet with at this time occupying the highest\r\nplace in the social scale are the _Leudes_, or\r\n_Antrustions_. Their name indicates their\r\nquality--_trust_ expresses fidelity. They were men who had\r\nproved faithful, and they succeeded the associates of the German\r\nchiefs. After the conquest, each of the chiefs established\r\nhimself, together with his own men, on a certain territory. The\r\nking had a larger and more considerable number of followers. Many\r\nremained with him. He had different means, which he very\r\nassiduously employed, of attaching to himself his Leudes, or of\r\nacquiring them.\r\n\r\n1st. This was evidently the result aimed at in conferring\r\nbenefices. In 587, Gontran, giving his advice to Childebert II.\r\non his conduct to those who were about him, points out to him\r\n\"those whom he ought to honour by appointments and by gifts, and\r\nthose to whom he ought to refuse them.\"\r\n\r\n2nd. The organization of the house, the palace, the court,\r\nborrowed in part from the traditions of the Roman empire, the\r\npassing amusements and the permanent advantages which were\r\nattached to them, induced many men of influence to become Leudes,\r\nor gave importance to the original Leudes of the king. The\r\nfollowing are names of some of their offices; \"count of the\r\npalace, referendary, seneschal, mareschal, falconer, butler,\r\nchamberlain, porter, head-porter, &c.\"\r\n\r\n{142}\r\n\r\n           Obligations Of The Leudes.\r\n\r\n3rd. Marculf has preserved to us the formula by which a man of\r\nimportance, _cum arimanniâ suâ_, \"with his freemen, his\r\nband,\" was accustomed to enrol himself among the king's Leudes.\r\nCharlemagne took various precautions in order that persons who\r\ncame to him in order to become his trusty followers (_de truste\r\nfaciendâ_), should meet with no obstacle.\r\n\r\n4th. It was to their Leudes that the kings were in the habit of\r\ngiving important public occupations, such as belonged to dukes,\r\ncounts, &c. There is reason for believing that these functions\r\noriginally belonged to the principal chief who established\r\nhimself in a territory. In the natural course of events these\r\nchiefs became themselves Leudes of the king or were supplanted by\r\nthose who were such.\r\n\r\n5th. The number of Leudes was the principal source of strength;\r\naccordingly they were multiplied by all kinds of devices. In 587,\r\nin the treaty of Andely, between Gontran and Childebert II, \"it\r\nwas agreed that neither of them should attempt to draw over to\r\nhimself the Leudes of the other, or receive them if they came of\r\ntheir own accord.\" We continually find Leudes of importance\r\nthreatening the king to leave his service, and enter into some\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe general obligation of the Leudes was fidelity, service in the\r\npalace, and military service. The price of this obligation was,\r\nfor the Leudes, power and riches. They had also certain civil\r\nadvantages, but of a more uncertain nature. Their _wehrgeld_\r\nwas a larger amount, whatever might otherwise have been their\r\norigin. We see that their prerogatives accumulated in proportion\r\nas their power was consolidated by the long possession of\r\nbenefices. Charlemagne desired that his vassals should be\r\nhonoured, and should hold, after himself, the first place in\r\nesteem. There were however among the Leudes of the king some who\r\nwere less powerful, and some who even were poor.\r\n\r\nEvery large proprietor had his Leudes; his house was organized\r\nafter the model of the king's; the same offices existed in each.\r\n\r\nIt is the opinion of Montesquieu, who is in this opposed by\r\nMontlosier, that the origin of the nobility is to be found in the\r\nLeudes. Neither of them has formed, in my judgment, a just and\r\nclear idea either of the condition of the Leudes or of the\r\ncharacter of the nobility. The rank of the Leude and his\r\nadvantages were purely of a personal character.\r\n{143}\r\nThe rank of a free Barbarian was hereditary, as were also his\r\nadvantages: but the rank of the Leude, that is to say, the\r\nadvantages and the superiority which he derived from his\r\nposition, tended to become hereditary; that of the free man, on\r\nthe other hand, tended, when he was isolated and left to himself,\r\nto become effaced and to lose its advantages. Most free men who\r\ndid not become beneficiaries, vassals, Leudes of some importance,\r\nceased to be free at all. The aristocracy of the Leudes tended to\r\nbe constituted, the liberty of the free men tended to be\r\ndestroyed:--the free men were, viewed in contrast with those who\r\nwere not free, an aristocracy on the decline; the Leudes were,\r\ncompared with free men, an aristocracy on the increase.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Formation Of The Frankish Nobility.\r\n\r\nMannert, in his treatise entitled, _The liberty of the Franks,\r\nFreyheit der Franken_, has very clearly explained the\r\nformation of the nobility among the Franks. There were many Roman\r\nGauls among the Leudes of the Frankish kings: we find, for\r\nexample, the names of _Protadius, Claudius, Florentinianus,_\r\namong the mayors of the palace towards the close of the sixth,\r\nand the commencement of the seventh century. They often changed\r\ntheir names into barbaric names. Thus the brother of Duke Lupus,\r\nborn a Roman, called himself _Magn-Wulfus _(great wolf), and\r\nhis son, who was bishop of Rheims, he called _Rom-Wulfus_\r\n(Roman wolf). These Romans entered into the company of the Leudes\r\nbecause they needed the protection of the kings; because they\r\nwere disposed to place what power they had in his service;\r\nbecause they were acquainted with the country, and knew that the\r\nking required them; because, lastly, the kings, when they\r\nembraced Christianity, became reconciled to many wealthy and\r\ninfluential Gauls.\r\n\r\nBishops, and the principal heads of monasteries, or of large\r\necclesiastical corporations, were reckoned among the number of\r\nthe king's Leudes. The power of the bishops among the Gauls,\r\nbefore the arrival of the Germans, is proved directly by facts;\r\ntheir influence, their wealth, is proved indirectly by the\r\neagerness with which the position of a bishop was sought. Their\r\nimportance was greatly augmented after the establishment of the\r\nBarbarians. They protected the ancient inhabitants from the\r\nBarbarian kings, and served the latter by their power in\r\ngoverning the ancient inhabitants.\r\n\r\n{144}\r\n\r\n              Power Of The Bishops.\r\n\r\nThey, and scarcely any but they, had preserved some science, some\r\nintellectual culture; the influence of religious ideas and\r\npractices over the converted barbarians was powerful; the\r\nimpressions formed were strong and vivid at that stage of\r\ncivilization: the clergy could excite the imagination, could\r\ntranquillize or alarm the conscience. The bishops and heads of\r\nmonasteries acquired, through a large number of sources, great\r\nwealth; they in process of time became large beneficiaries; most\r\nof the property given to churches were given as benefices, and\r\nconsequently involved the obligations belonging to that title;\r\nsome property was conferred \"with the complete right of\r\nproprietorship.\" In 807, Charlemagne charged his son Pepin to\r\nprevent the dukes and counts to whom the government of the\r\nprovinces had been committed, from exacting from churches all the\r\nservices due in general from free men. In 816, Louis the\r\nDebonnair provided that each church should possess a farm\r\nabsolutely free from all charge. Facts disclose at every step the\r\nimportance of the bishops; they were employed in important\r\ntransactions, and assisted in drawing up laws. Counts, dukes,\r\nlarge Barbarian proprietors, became bishops. The temporal\r\nconsequences attached to ecclesiastical excommunication did not\r\nfail to put into their hands a powerful weapon of attack or\r\ndefence. Churches obtained immunities of all kinds, from military\r\nservice, rights of custom, &c.; they became asylums of refuge--a\r\npopular right which, during these times of brute violence, far\r\nmore generally protected the innocent than shielded the guilty.\r\n\r\nThe nomination of bishops was an ancient right of the priests and\r\nthe faithful. The importance of these functions, and the riches\r\nof the churches, induced the king to encroach upon this\r\nprerogative. Further, they urged some kind of claim to it, as\r\nbeing lords of the churches on which they had conferred\r\nbenefices. They used the right of confirmation in order to\r\npossess themselves of the right of nomination. At first, bishops\r\nwere the most sure and devoted Leudes of the king; kings and\r\nbishops had need of one another. Very soon afterwards the bishops\r\nbecame so powerful as to be able to act independently of the\r\nkings.\r\n\r\n{145}\r\n\r\nAt this epoch convents also assumed great importance, although\r\ntheir heads do not seem to have played so prominent a part in\r\nPrance as in England.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, the power of the clergy at this period was as\r\nuseful as it was great. It awakened and developed moral\r\nnecessities among the Barbarians;--it commanded and inspired a\r\nrespect for the rights and sufferings of the feeble;--it gave an\r\nillustration of the reality of moral force, when everything was\r\nat the disposal of material force. That is a false notion which\r\nassumes that an institution or an influence is to be attacked by\r\nreason of the evil effects which it may produce after centuries\r\nof existence; we must consider and appreciate it in the times\r\nwhen it was originally formed.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Free Men.\r\n\r\nFrom the Leudes, let us pass to those who were simply free men.\r\n\r\nThere are words which have, in our time, so simple and absolute a\r\nsignification, that we apply them without consideration or\r\nscruple to times in which their actual significance was not\r\nrecognized at all. The expression _free man_ is an example.\r\nIf by it we mean the man who is not a slave, the man who is not\r\nthe property of another man, and can neither be given nor sold as\r\nan article of traffic, there were a great number of free men from\r\nthe fifth to the tenth centuries. But if we attach to this\r\nexpression the political sense which it possesses in our days,\r\nthat is to say, the idea of a citizen dependent on no other\r\ncitizen, who depends for the safety of his person and his\r\nproperty only upon the state, and the laws of the state, the\r\nnumber of free men was very inconsiderable at the period of which\r\nwe speak, and was continually diminishing. Most of those who were\r\nnot serfs were engaged or were binding themselves with increasing\r\nfrequency, either for the security of their persons or of their\r\nproperties, to the service, and to a certain amount of dependency\r\nupon some man more powerful than themselves, who employed them in\r\nhis house or protected them at a distance. The independence of\r\nthe citizen as it existed in the republics of antiquity, and as\r\nit exists in our public communities, became more and more rare\r\nfrom the fifth to the tenth centuries. Eminent publicists, M. de\r\nSavigny among others, in his _Histoire du droit romain dans le\r\nmoyen âge_, have affirmed that always at this period a\r\nnumerous class of free men existed, true citizens, exempt from\r\nall personal dependence, depending only upon the state and\r\nforming the body of the nation.\r\n{146}\r\nThis involves a complete confusion of times' and a\r\nmisapprehension of the natural succession of events. Doubtless at\r\nthe time of the invasion, and during the period which immediately\r\nfollowed it, there were many free men of this kind; the\r\nindependence of individuals who live a wandering and barbarian\r\nlife did not suddenly and completely vanish under the influence\r\nof the new circumstances which resulted from their territorial\r\nestablishment. But, so far as regards the greater number of free\r\nmen, this independence was rapidly absorbed by new ties, and by\r\nthe very numerous and various forms of feudal hierarchy. We may\r\nthink we have found, under certain names which are frequently to\r\nbe met with in documents and historical works, such as,\r\n_Arimanni, Erimanni, Herimanni, Hermanni_, among the\r\nLombards, and _Rachimburgi, Rathimburgi, Regimburgi_, among\r\nthe Franks, a class of men actually free--citizens in the sense\r\nin which we use the words at the present time. But when we\r\ninvestigate more closely, we soon learn that no such class is to\r\nbe found, and that nearly if not quite all the _Arimanni_ or\r\n_Rathimburgi_, were bound in the fetters of a feudal\r\norganization and depended far more on some superior individual\r\nthan on the protection of the state.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Enfranchisement.\r\n\r\nMany learned men also think that the practice of enfranchisement\r\nwhich prevailed at this period created many free men--as\r\ncompletely so, as if they had inherited their freedom as a\r\nbirthright. This also is, I think, a mistake. Enfranchisement was\r\nfrequent, but it conferred complete freedom on very few; it\r\ntransformed many into cultivators and tributaries, or placed them\r\nin other analogous positions, which however did not insure entire\r\nliberty. In order to be convinced of this, we have only to\r\nexamine the acts of enfranchisement themselves. There were\r\nseveral kinds, and each was attended with different consequences.\r\nWe find, _First_, the _denariales_, or enfranchised\r\nwith respect to the king; although their life was valued at 200\r\n_solidi_, like the life of a Frank, yet their liberty was\r\nincomplete; they could not bequeath property to others than their\r\nchildren; the composition for their lives was paid to the king,\r\nnot to their relatives, which plainly shows that the king\r\nregarded them, as _homines regii_. _Second_, those\r\nenfranchised with respect to the church, or _tribularii_.\r\n{147}\r\nThose thus enfranchised became _homines ecclesiastici;_ they\r\ncould not become _denariales_ according to the laws of the\r\nRipuarians, and their property went to the church if they died\r\nwithout issue. _Third_, those enfranchised _per chartam,\r\nchartulari_i. The expressions of the charter which gave them\r\ntheir liberty seem to be completely unambiguous; but it is\r\ndoubtful whether the results were similarly unambiguous, since\r\nthe _denariales_ themselves remained, in certain respects,\r\nin an inferior condition. The statutes of Charlemagne, which\r\nprovide that the terms of composition for the _denariales_\r\nshould be paid to the king, and that they should not possess\r\ntheir liberty as a heritage till after the third generation,\r\napply the same conditions also to the _chartularii_, and\r\neven to those who were enfranchised to the church, the\r\n_tabularii_.\r\n\r\nThe act and the consequences of enfranchisement varied in the\r\ncourse of the epoch on which our attention is occupied. This fact\r\nhas not been observed by M. Montlosier and all those who bring\r\ntogether facts separated from one another by a long interval of\r\ntime, in order to make a complete system. They apply to the same\r\nepoch facts belonging to different times. History presents us\r\nwith instances of slaves who, after the Germanic invasion, raised\r\nthemselves to the condition not only of free men, but of Leudes\r\nand large proprietors. Individual cases of these are well\r\nauthenticated, and were very likely to have occurred in these\r\ntimes of disorder; but from these no general rule is to be\r\ninferred. In spite of the vast influence of religious ideas--and\r\nall formulas of enfranchisement are prefaced by the expression of\r\na religious sentiment and design--the general movement of the\r\nepoch which we are considering, so far as regards the condition\r\nof persons, was much more towards the extension of servitude,\r\nunder different forms and in varying degrees, than towards the\r\nmaintenance or the advancement of liberty.\r\n\r\n{148}\r\n\r\n              Lecture XVIII.\r\n\r\n  Simultaneous existence of three systems of institutions, after\r\n  the settlement of the Franks in Gaul.\r\n\r\n  Conflict of these three systems.\r\n\r\n  Summary of this conflict, its vicissitudes, and results.\r\n\r\n  Its recurrence in local and central institutions.\r\n\r\n  Of local institutions under the Frankish monarchy.\r\n\r\n  Of the assemblies of free men.\r\n\r\n  Of the authority and jurisdiction of the great landowners in\r\n  their estates.\r\n\r\n  Of the authority and jurisdiction of the dukes, counts, and\r\n  other royal officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Three Systems Of Institutions.\r\n\r\nFrom the ancient condition of the barbarians in Germany, and from\r\ntheir new situation after their establishment in the Roman\r\nempire, there issued three systems of institutions, of different\r\nprinciples and results, which, from the fifth to the tenth\r\ncentury, co-existed at first for some time, and afterwards\r\ncommingled and conflicted with each other with alternate success\r\nand defeat.\r\n\r\nIn their primitive state, in Germany, the Barbarians were all\r\nfree; every individual was important--nothing of any moment could\r\nbe undertaken or decided upon without the approbation and\r\nconcurrence of the majority. Hence arose the common discussion of\r\naffairs of common interest, and the influence of election upon\r\nthe choice of chiefs or judges or in other words, the\r\ninstitutions of liberty.\r\n\r\nThe second principle with which we meet is the attachment and\r\nsubordination of the tribesmen to their chief. Up to a certain\r\npoint they were dependent upon him, even for their subsistence.\r\nThis dependence increased after their territorial establishment.\r\nThe authority of the chiefs over their comrades augmented; and\r\nthe liberty of the latter diminished with their importance. They\r\nbecame beneficiaries or vassals, colonists, or even serfs; a\r\nhierarchy was formed among the landowners. Hence arose those\r\naristocratic and hierarchical institutions which gave birth to\r\nthe feudal system.\r\n\r\n{149}\r\n\r\nThe power of the kings, originally very limited, became extended\r\nafter conquest by the dispersion, of the nation, the concession\r\nof benefices, and the predominance of the principle of hereditary\r\nsuccession to the throne. A conflict arose, not between the power\r\nof the king and the liberties of the citizens, but between the\r\npower of the king and that of the nobles, especially of the\r\nking's own Leudes. The kings made attempts to found the entire\r\ngovernment upon the monarchical principle, and, with this object,\r\nto place themselves in direct connexion with all their subjects.\r\nUnder Charlemagne, this attempt reached its apogee, and seemed\r\nlikely to succeed. But the monarchical system succumbed beneath\r\nthe feudal system.\r\n\r\nThus, free institutions, aristocratic institutions, monarchical\r\ninstitutions:--local and general assemblies of free men to\r\ndeliberate on common affairs, military, judicial, or others, in\r\npresence of or in concert with the king or his delegates:--the\r\nsubordination of the simple free man to the lord, of the vassal\r\nto the chieftain; the nobles administering justice, making war\r\nwith each other, and imposing certain charges on their vassals;\r\nthe progressive organization of the royal power; dukes, counts,\r\nroyal officers, _missi dominici_, transacting public affairs\r\nand administering justice, even in opposition to the\r\nnobles:--these are the three systems of facts, the three\r\ntendencies which present themselves to our notice during the\r\nperiod from the fifth to the tenth century. The conflict of these\r\nthree tendencies constitutes the history of the public\r\ninstitutions of this epoch.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Decline Of Free Institutions.\r\n\r\nThe system of free institutions rapidly declined. It succumbed\r\nbeneath the system of the predominance of the great landowners,\r\nand of the hierarchy of benefices. A conflict arose between the\r\nprinciples of the feudal system, and the endeavours of the\r\nmonarchical system. In the conflict of these two systems,\r\nhowever, we find remnants of the system of free institutions.\r\nThese remnants were allied sometimes to the feudal, sometimes to\r\nthe monarchical system--most frequently to the latter.\r\nCharlemagne attempted to render the institutions of liberty\r\nauxiliary to the triumph of the monarchical system. We observed\r\nsomething analogous to this in the history of the Anglo-Saxons;\r\nbut there the system of free institutions never perished; the\r\ncommon deliberation of the free landowners, in the county-courts,\r\nalways subsisted. Among the Franks, the simultaneity and conflict\r\nof the three systems were more distinct and animated; the first\r\nwas the weakest and perished early.\r\n\r\n{150}\r\n\r\nIn treating of the Franks, as of the Anglo-Saxons, we shall first\r\nexamine their local institutions, and then their general\r\ninstitutions; and we shall everywhere meet with the great fact to\r\nwhich I have just alluded. We shall follow it in its\r\nvicissitudes, and we shall see, first, how the system of free\r\ninstitutions perished, in localities and at the centre; secondly,\r\nhow the monarchical system was for a moment really successful and\r\nstrongly predominant under Charlemagne alone; and thirdly, how\r\nthe feudal system, that is to say, the aristocratic and\r\nhierarchical organization of territorial properties and\r\nsovereignties, could not but prevail, as it really did in the\r\nend.\r\n\r\n\r\n          Of Local Institutions.\r\n\r\nIn Frankish Gaul, as among the Anglo-Saxons, the territory was\r\ndivided into counties, hundreds, and tythings. [Footnote 14]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 14:  That is, of course, districts analogous to\r\n    these divisions.]\r\n\r\nThe counts were called _grafen, judices;_ the centeniers,\r\n_centgrafen;_ and the tything-men, _tungini,\r\nthingrafen._ Each of these officers held a court, _placitum,\r\nmallum,_ at which justice was administered, and the business\r\nof the district transacted. This court was at first an assembly\r\nof all the free men of the district; they were bound to attend,\r\nand a heavy fine was imposed as the penalty for non-attendance.\r\nThere, as I have said, they distributed justice, and deliberated\r\nupon matters of common interest. Civil transactions, sales,\r\nwills, enfranchisements, were carried on in public. There, also,\r\nmilitary convocations were made. The court or _plaid_ of the\r\ntything-man, _decanus_, is seldom met with, and was of\r\nlittle importance, as in England. The powers of the courts or\r\nassemblies of free men, held by the _centenarii_ and\r\n_vicarii_ were somewhat limited; judgments could not be\r\ngiven upon questions involving property or personal liberty,\r\nunless it were in presence of the imperial envoys or the counts.\r\n\r\nSuch were the free institutions and the meetings for common\r\ndeliberation, of separate localities. These primitive\r\n_plaids_ correspond to the ancient assemblies of the Germans\r\nin Germany.\r\n\r\n{151}\r\n\r\nBesides the _plaids_ of freemen, appears the jurisdiction of\r\nthe nobles or important landowners over the persons who dwelt on\r\ntheir domains. The chieftain distributed justice to his comrades,\r\nor, as they had now become, his colonists. His jurisdiction was\r\nnot, however, altogether arbitrary; his comrades were his\r\nassessors in his court. The _conjuratores_, who attested the\r\ntruth of the facts stated, almost entirely settled the affair. If\r\nwe consider these institutions in their origin, we find that the\r\nseignorial courts of justice, although obscure and somewhat\r\ninactive, existed simultaneously with the assemblies of freemen,\r\nexempt from the circumscription and jurisdiction of the officers\r\nof the crown. The jurisdiction of the churches was derived from\r\nthe jurisdiction of the seigneurs, and both were exercised in\r\nvirtue of the proprietorship of the domain, which rendered the\r\nlandlord the patron of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Rudiments Of Feudalism.\r\n\r\nThese are the first rudiments of that feudal organization which,\r\nby establishing the authority and jurisdiction of the seigneur\r\nover his tenants, vassals or colonists, constantly tended to\r\ndestroy the authority and jurisdiction of the assemblies of free\r\nmen. A conflict began between the feudal principle of\r\nhierarchical subordination, and the principle of the union of\r\nequals in common deliberation. This conflict commenced as early\r\nas the beginning of the epoch which now occupies our attention.\r\n\r\nLet us now examine how the royal power was exercised in separate\r\nlocalities during this period. The dukes, counts, centeniers, and\r\nothers, were probably at the outset, as I have already observed,\r\nnot mere delegates of the king, but the natural chieftains, the\r\nmost powerful and extensive landowners. It is quite erroneous to\r\nbelieve that, originally, a county corresponded to what is now\r\ncalled a department, and that the king appointed and sent a count\r\nto govern it as he now sends a prefect. The king, the head of the\r\nnation, naturally directed the most important man in the district\r\nto convoke together the free men of the district for military\r\npurposes, and to collect the revenues of the royal domains; and\r\nthis person thus received a sort of appointment from the king.\r\nThe increasing importance of the palace and court of the\r\nkings--the influence of Roman institutions and ideas, at length\r\nmade this appointment the source of a title. The counts became\r\nLeudes, and _vice versâ_, the Leudes became counts.\r\n\r\n{152}\r\n\r\nDuring a considerable period the hereditariness of these officers\r\nwas not recognised. Some antiquaries even are of opinion that\r\nthese employments were given for a fixed time only. There is more\r\nreason to believe that this point was not definitely determined,\r\nand that, in fact, these offices were long unlimited as to their\r\nduration, and always transferable; numerous instances can be\r\nbrought in support of this theory. The Frankish kings frequently\r\nallowed the natural chieftains of the countries which they\r\nconquered to retain their former position and ancient rights.\r\nThus the Bavarian dukes were hereditary. When Louis the Debonnair\r\nreceived the Spaniards into the south of France, he permitted\r\ntheir counts to retain their titles and jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Dukes And Counts.\r\n\r\nThe title of count become an object of ambition on account of the\r\nadvantages connected therewith. The count possessed great power,\r\na share of the fines, _freda_, and immense facilities for\r\nacquiring property in the district under his jurisdiction. These\r\noffices also supplied the kings with means for enriching their\r\nLeudes, or obtaining new ones. Under the Merovingians, perpetual\r\ninstability prevailed in respect to these offices as well as to\r\nbenefices; they were obtained by presents or purchased by money.\r\nNevertheless, the office of count was frequently transmitted from\r\nfather to son; this was natural, and usage could not fail to\r\nprecede right; the count or duke, being almost always an\r\nimportant personage in his canton or town, independently of his\r\noffice, his son, who succeeded to his importance, succeeded\r\nfrequently to his office also.\r\n\r\nSome writers have affirmed that there was a great distinction\r\nbetween the dukes and the counts; it has even been asserted that\r\neach duke had twelve counts under his orders. No such regularity\r\nexisted in local administration. We meet with some counts equal\r\nin power to dukes; among the Burgundians, for example, some\r\ncounts ruled over several provinces. We may say, however, that in\r\ngeneral the duke was superior to the count. We may even presume\r\nthat, originally, the office of duke was military, and that of\r\nthe count, judicial; although the two missions frequently appear\r\nconfounded. A formula of Marculf assimilates the dukes, counts,\r\nand patricians. The margraves were the counts of the marches or\r\nfrontiers. The men of the court, the delegates of the king,\r\nfinished by being counts everywhere.\r\n\r\n{153}\r\n\r\nThus there co-existed the three systems of institutions which I\r\nhave mentioned: 1. the assemblies of freemen, having authority\r\nand jurisdiction; 2. the great landowners, whether beneficiary or\r\nallodial, lay or ecclesiastical, proprietors--having authority\r\nand jurisdiction; 3. the administrators or delegates of the king,\r\nhaving authority and jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Extension Of Seignorial Jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the disorders of the Merovingian race, we find\r\nthat the assemblies of free men rapidly declined. Most of the\r\nfree men ceased to attend. Some became powerful enough to aim at\r\nindependence, others became so weak as to lose their freedom. The\r\ncommon deliberation of free men disappeared. The principle of the\r\nsubordination of the individual to the individual, in virtue of\r\nprotection, vassalage, patronage, or colonage, prevailed.\r\nSeignorial jurisdictions, both lay and ecclesiastical, became\r\nextended. Their extension and consolidation were the necessary\r\nconsequence of the extension and consolidation of benefices. The\r\ndiminution of the number of allodial estates, the increase of\r\ntributary lands, and the corresponding changes which were\r\nintroduced into the condition of persons, necessarily removed the\r\ngreater number of justiceables from the jurisdiction of the\r\nassemblies of free men and from that of the king. Even the care\r\nwhich was taken by the first Carlovingians to compel the\r\nseigneurs to administer justice, and to control their\r\nadministration of it, proves the progress of this kind of\r\njurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe liberty allowed to every man to live under any law he\r\npleased, could not but contribute also to this result; it tended\r\nto disperse society, for it placed men under the jurisdiction of\r\nthose who had their own private code of laws; and thus it opposed\r\nunion, and common deliberation. It was a kind of liberty,\r\ndoubtless--a liberty necessary in the state of society which then\r\nexisted; but this liberty, like almost all other liberties at\r\nthis period, was a principle of isolation.\r\n\r\n{154}\r\n\r\n              Lecture XIX.\r\n\r\n  Government of Charlemagne.\r\n\r\n  Apparent revival of free institutions.\r\n\r\n  Individual independence and social liberty.\r\n\r\n  Organization of monarchical power under Charlemagne.\r\n\r\n  His active surveillance over his vassals and agents.\r\n\r\n  Rapid decline of monarchical institutions after his death.\r\n\r\n  Definitive predominance of the feudal system.\r\n\r\n  Central institutions during the same epoch: royalty.\r\n\r\n  Causes of the progress of royalty, and of the principle of\r\n  hereditary succession among the Franks.\r\n\r\n  Influence of the clergy.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Two Meanings Of Personal Liberty.\r\n\r\nAfter the Merovingian anarchy, at the accession of the\r\nCarlovingians and especially during the reign of Charlemagne, two\r\nfacts, which seem contradictory, present themselves to our\r\nnotice. Free institutions appear to gain new life, and at the\r\nsame time the monarchical system evidently prevails. We must\r\nclosely study this singular coincidence, and endeavour thoroughly\r\nto understand its causes.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways in which we may understand a man's personal\r\nliberty; first, as the independence of the individual having no\r\nlaw but his own will; and secondly, as the enfranchisement of\r\nevery individual from every other individual will, which is\r\ncontrary to reason and justice.\r\n\r\nLiberty, if taken in the first sense, is barbarous and\r\nanti-social; it is the infancy, or rather the absence, of\r\nsociety. The word _society_ itself indicates the union of\r\nindividuals in one common idea, feeling, and interest. Society\r\ncan exist only by the obedience of individuals to one common\r\nrule. If the liberty of each man constitutes his only law, if\r\nevery restriction to the independence of individual will is\r\nconsidered illegitimate, society is impossible. The law which\r\nshould rule society, according to truth and justice, is exterior\r\nto and independent of individual wills. The object of society is\r\nto discover this superior law, and to exact obedience to it\r\nalone; but to this law obedience must be given; society is\r\npossible only by the reign of brute force, or by the government\r\nof true law. If the independence of the individual is regarded as\r\nthe condition of liberty, we may be certain that force will\r\nbecome the dominant power of society, for society there must be;\r\nit is an imperious necessity of human nature; and this necessity\r\nwill receive its gratification from force, if it cannot obtain it\r\nfrom justice and reason.\r\n\r\n{155}\r\n\r\n              Object Of Government.\r\n\r\nThe object of government, then, is twofold; it proposes, first,\r\nto seek out and discover the true law which must decide all the\r\nquestions to which social relations give rise, and to subject to\r\nthis law all adverse individual wills; and secondly, to prevent\r\nindividuals from being subjected to any other laws but the true\r\nlaw, such, for example, as the arbitrary will of other more\r\npowerful individuals. Good and true government, then, does not\r\nsay to every individual: \"Thou shalt be subject only to thy own\r\ncaprice,\" for on these terms there could be no society, and no\r\ngovernment; but it says: \"Thou shalt be subject, not to the\r\ncaprice of any other individual, but only to reason and justice.\"\r\nThe progress of civilization consists, on the one hand, in\r\nextending the authority of reason over all individuals, and in\r\nneglecting no means to convince their individual reason and to\r\nrender their obedience voluntary; and, on the other hand, in\r\nlimiting the sway of the arbitrary will of individuals over one\r\nanother. Where the arbitrary will of one or more individuals\r\nprevails, legitimate liberty does not exist; where the isolated\r\nindependence of every individual is maintained, society is\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this distinction between moral and natural\r\nliberty, between social freedom and individual independence, is\r\nimmense. It would be easy to demonstrate its intimate connexion\r\nwith the true theory of liberty, considered in relation to man\r\npersonally, and independently of society. It is as a reasonable\r\nbeing, capable of recognizing truth, that man is sublime; therein\r\nresides the divinity of his nature: liberty is in him nothing but\r\nthe power of obeying the truth which he recognises, and making\r\nhis actions conform thereto. On this ground, liberty is very\r\nrespectable; but liberty is respectable on this ground alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Origin Of Despotism.\r\n\r\nIn the infancy of society, the liberty which almost all men\r\ndesire and defend, is natural liberty--liberty to do nothing but\r\nwhat they please. This is caused by the imperfection of the moral\r\ndevelopment of each individual, and by the imperfection of the\r\nsame development in the social powers; from which imperfection it\r\nresults that these powers ill-understand the true law, never\r\napply it, and are themselves directed by individual wills, as\r\narbitrary as they are capricious.\r\n{156}\r\nOn this account, the state of freedom with which we meet at the\r\noutset of all societies lasts for so short a time, and is so\r\nquickly superseded by the despotism of one or several persons.\r\nSociety cannot exist if natural liberty, that is, individual\r\nindependence, exists in all the extent of its desire: and as\r\nsociety is as yet ignorant both how to govern according to the\r\nmoral law, and how to respect moral liberty, force seizes upon\r\nthe government.\r\n\r\nWhen, in such a state of society, a man of superior genius and\r\ncharacter appears, he is inevitably driven to found a despotism,\r\nthat is, the empire of his own individual will. He is irritated\r\nand offended by the collision of all these barbarous or stupid\r\nindividual wills; his instinct tells him that society cannot\r\nexist in this manner, that such a state of things is not society.\r\nHe is personally disgusted, moreover, at the sway which all these\r\nnarrow and ignorant wills claim to exercise over all things, and\r\neven over himself. The authority of blind force over enlightened\r\nforce is nothing but a despotism; and what is greater insolence\r\nthan the power of a brutal multitude over a lofty individual\r\nreason? The superior man becomes indignant and seeks to free\r\nhimself from this yoke, to impose some rule upon this disorder;\r\nand this rule he seeks in his own reason, in his own will. Thus\r\nis established, at such epochs, the despotism of a single person;\r\nit is not radically illegitimate, and the best proof that it is\r\nnot, is afforded by the easy reception with which he meets the\r\nadmiration with which he is regarded, the gratitude even which he\r\ninspires, and which lasts as long as the state of things which\r\noriginated his power. In truth, the loftiest superiority, that\r\nwhich is most naturally called to empire by the disorder and\r\ndissolution of society, soon becomes corrupted and rude, by\r\nbecoming itself a purely individual will, full of egotism and\r\ncaprice: but that which constituted its force and credit, at the\r\noutset, was its better comprehension of the general wants of\r\nsociety; it had obtained a deeper knowledge of the true law which\r\nmust govern society; and it rescued society from its losing\r\nbattle with a multitude of ignorant or ferocious individual\r\nwills.\r\n\r\n{157}\r\n\r\n         The Monarchy Of Charlemagne.\r\n\r\nIt is by these means that great men triumph at first. It was thus\r\nthat Charlemagne triumphed; it was thus that the first three\r\nCarlovingians, Pepin of Heristal, Charles Martel, and Pepin the\r\nShort, had prepared the way for him. Under the Merovingians, the\r\nstate was falling into dissolution; every strong man was making\r\nhimself independent, every weak man was falling into subjection\r\nto a stronger. Although the Pepins had sprung from the dominant\r\naristocracy, they early struggled against its excesses. Charles\r\nMartel put down the petty tyrants who had sprung up in every\r\ndirection. The tendency of Charlemagne's policy was to establish\r\nthe monarchical system, that is, to secure the universal\r\nprevalence of his will by making it felt everywhere by means of\r\nhis agents. In order to understand with any exactness what was\r\nCharlemagne's pure monarchy, we must see how he managed his own\r\nproperty, and in what manner he administered his palace. The\r\nactivity of his surveillance was surprising; we shall find\r\ndetails of it in his capitulary _De villis_, and in the\r\nfirst part of one of Hincmar's letters. He governed his empire in\r\nthe same spirit. This was the only means he possessed for\r\nrestoring order, and applying the national forces to the\r\naccomplishment of his designs. Into the despotism of a superior\r\nman, there always enters a powerful instinctive feeling of\r\njustice, and of protection to the weak. Charlemagne diligently\r\nendeavoured to check the power of the nobles by subjecting them\r\nto surveillance, and by bringing his subjects into direct\r\nrelationship with the royal authority. He paid great attention to\r\nthe employment and administration of his benefices, even when in\r\nthe hands of beneficiaries; he was careful not to give more than\r\none county to the same count, and this rule he rarely\r\ntransgressed; he ordered the nobles to distribute strict justice\r\nto their vassals, and took most energetic measures to compel them\r\nto do so, and to judge all men according to the law. Charlemagne\r\nalso kept watch over the conduct of the counts; the assemblies of\r\nfree men had almost entirely perished; and they requested as a\r\nfavour to be allowed to absent themselves. To supply the place of\r\nthe active surveillance exercised by these ancient assemblies,\r\nCharlemagne created the _missi dominici_. These were\r\ninspectors of the whole state of the kingdom, and particularly of\r\nthe conduct of the counts and nobles.\r\n\r\n{158}\r\n\r\n         Decline Of The Frankish Monarchy.\r\n\r\nThe delegates of Charlemagne, the imperial judges, had assessors;\r\nand as the free men whose duty it was to fill the office of\r\nassessors seldom attended the periodical assemblies, Charlemagne\r\nsuperseded them by the _scabini_, who were appointed by the\r\n_missi dominici_, whom he enjoined to select them with the\r\ngreatest care. This intervention of the delegates of the\r\nsovereign himself in judicial affairs, was a powerful means of\r\nmonarchical centralization.\r\n\r\nIn his Frankish empire, it was not against the ancient free\r\ninstitutions, but against public anarchy and the disorderly power\r\nof the strong, that Charlemagne directed these means of\r\ngovernment. In his other dominions, wherever he feared the\r\ninfluence of liberty, his despotism was exerted to crush it\r\nrigorously; thus he interdicted all public assemblies of the\r\nSaxons.\r\n\r\nAll this monarchical organization fell with Charlemagne. Its\r\nexistence is protracted, as if by habit, in the speeches and laws\r\nof Louis the Debonnair; but the hand which sustained the edifice\r\nis no longer there. The language of Charlemagne in the mouth of\r\nCharles the Bald, is nothing but a piece of ridiculous\r\nrhodomontade. The feudal system gains the upper hand and\r\norganizes itself in every direction. The great vassals either\r\nattack the king or isolate themselves from him. The dignity of\r\ncount became so considerable, that the sons of kings and emperors\r\ndesire and obtain it. Hereditary succession prevails in the\r\noffices of dukes, counts, viscounts, &c. Rhegino cites as a\r\nsingular fact that the sons of Duke Robert did not succeed to his\r\ndukedom, and assigns as the reason, that their tender age\r\nrendered them incapable of repulsing the Normans. The sons of two\r\ncounts of Austria were not put into possession of the counties of\r\ntheir fathers; so their relations took arms, and drove out the\r\nusurper. The power of the counts, now they had become hereditary\r\nseigneurs, was augmented by the authority they had exercised,\r\nunder that title, as delegates of the king. The feudal hierarchy,\r\nstrong by its own intrinsic power, thus gained additional\r\nstrength from the wreck of royal authority. Hence resulted a new\r\norder of local institutions, which I cannot now explain.\r\n\r\n{159}\r\n\r\nThe picture of central institutions reproduces, under another\r\naspect, the same facts, and leads to the same results. Central\r\ninstitutions, as you are aware, may be reduced to two--royalty,\r\nand the general assemblies of the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Royalty Among The Franks.\r\n\r\nTo royalty among the Franks you may apply what I have said of\r\nroyalty among the Anglo-Saxons; only, among the Franks, the royal\r\nfamily does not bear, at the outset, the character of a religious\r\nfiliation. This is perhaps attributable to the fact that the\r\nFranks were a confederation of different tribes; among them, the\r\nking appears especially as a military chieftain. Under the first\r\nMerovingians, there was always a great mixture of hereditariness\r\nand election; hereditariness fluctuated among the members of the\r\nsame family; election, when it was not an act of violence, was\r\nrather a recognition than an election.\r\n\r\nIt is a grave error to expect to find in facts the basis of a\r\nprimitive and exclusive law: facts may be made to demonstrate\r\nanything. The most opposite parties have fallen into the same\r\nerror in this respect. Whoever has discovered, at the origin of a\r\nstate, an act of violence in conformity to his preconceived\r\nopinion, takes it as the foundation of what he calls the general\r\nlaw. Some fancy they can discern absolute and well-regulated\r\nhereditary succession in the midst of barbarism; others transfer\r\nthe troubles and violence of a barbarian election into a more\r\nadvanced stage of civilization; whatever they find existing as\r\n_fact_ in the infancy of society, they convert into\r\n_law_ for society in its greatest extension and development.\r\nThis is neither philosophy nor history. The ruling _law_ is\r\nthat which is conformable to reason and justice. There is always\r\nmore or less of this law at every epoch in the life of human\r\nsociety; but at no epoch is it pure or complete. We must resign\r\nourselves to the task of freeing it everywhere from all alloy.\r\n\r\nLet us then pass by the primitive and exclusive right of royal\r\nheredity, which existed neither among the Franks nor in other\r\ncountries; all that can be said is that the principle of\r\nhereditary monarchy tended, early and constantly, to prevail. The\r\nheirship of the private domain of the kings, which was of\r\nconsiderable value, powerfully contributed to establish the\r\nheirship of the kingdom, just as the partition of the private\r\ndomain among the sons led to the partition of the royal\r\ndominions; but the partition of the kingdom was almost always\r\nmade with the consent of the nobles, whilst the heirship of the\r\ncrown, in each state, does not appear to have required their\r\nformal assent.\r\n\r\n{160}\r\n\r\n         Fall Of The Merovingians.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen what were the causes which occasioned the\r\nfall of the Merovingian race, and the accession of Carlovingians.\r\nThe fall of the latter, in the tenth century presents some\r\nfeatures of similarity to that of the Merovingians, but between\r\nthe two, there was greater diversity than resemblance. The\r\nancient companions of the Frankish kings, the Leudes, the\r\nAntrustions, and the beneficiaries, had left the court,\r\nestablished themselves on their lands, and become feudal lords:\r\nrevolutions were no longer effected at the foot of the throne,\r\nand in the interior of the royal palace. The feudal lords were\r\nmuch more isolated, not only from the king, but also from one\r\nanother, than the Leudes had been under the Merovingians. Pepin\r\nthe Short was king in fact when Childeric III. was king in name;\r\nPepin assumed the name belonging to his power. At the end of the\r\ntenth century, there was no king, and no powerful man in the\r\nking's service who wielded the royal power in the name of Louis\r\nV. Hugh Capet took possession of an almost vacant place, which,\r\nat the moment, added much to his dignity, but little to his\r\nauthority. After the fall of the Merovingians, Pepin and\r\nCharlemagne were able to attempt to establish the monarchical\r\nsystem, and to inaugurate the central authority of the king; Hugh\r\nCapet was unable to do this, nor did he attempt it; the feudal\r\nlordships had divided the kingdom amongst them. Pepin was the\r\nhead of an aristocracy which had its centre in the palace of the\r\nMerovingian kings. Hugh Capet was one of the principal members of\r\nan aristocracy which had no centre; he made himself king because\r\nthe crown was within his reach. If Louis V. had resided at Rouen,\r\nthe Duke of Normandy would probably have seized the monarchy.\r\n\r\nAs regards the nature and extent of the royal authority, what I\r\nhave already said sufficiently indicates what it was: very\r\nlimited and precarious before the settlement of the Franks on\r\nRoman territory--being nothing but the power of the chief of a\r\nwarlike band, always restrained by the presence of the free men,\r\nhis comrades--it became extended and strengthened after the\r\nconquest by various causes:\r\n\r\n{161}\r\n\r\n              Authority And Liberty.\r\n\r\n  1. By the dispersion of the Franks. They ceased constantly, to\r\n  surround the king; his authority was but slight over those who\r\n  left him; but those who were habitually near him depended more\r\n  closely upon him; a court of barbarian servants succeeded to a\r\n  court of warriors.\r\n\r\n  2. By the subjugation of neighbouring chiefs or kings.\r\n\r\n  3. By the increasing inequality of wealth: the royal property\r\n  greatly augmented, and this was their principal source of\r\n  power; they devoted all their energies to the amassing of\r\n  treasure; it was useless to leave their children a kingdom,\r\n  unless they could at the same time bequeath to them a full\r\n  exchequer.\r\n\r\n  4. By the influence of religious and Roman ideas. In the\r\n  opinion of the Christians, the king was the successor of Saul\r\n  and of David; in that of the Romans, he was the representative\r\n  of the emperors. The Frankish kings were fully sensible of the\r\n  advantages of this two-fold position, and they eagerly accepted\r\n  the titles of Patrician and Consul. But the royal authority had\r\n  no definite character; it was proportionate to the ability and\r\n  energy of those who exercised it.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more different than the idea of royal authority in\r\nthose times and in our own day. If a village were now to\r\ndisregard the king's authority, or to refuse to obey him, it\r\nwould be a serious event, the sign of a great decay of power.\r\nSuch was not the case then; authority was not universally\r\ndiffused over the country; remote places and interests were in\r\nsome sort independent of it. It had no real supremacy, except in\r\ncase of war; the rays of its influence were short, and wherever\r\nit was applied, it was matter of fact rather than of right.\r\n\r\nWith regard to authority and liberty, right and fact are almost\r\nidentical in the infancy of society. The idea of right, separate\r\nfrom fact, has but very little power and can scarcely be said to\r\nexist. Hence arise the eternal vicissitudes of authority and\r\nliberty; whoever ceases to possess them is never permitted to\r\nregain them. It is the work and the master-work of civilization\r\nto separate right from fact, and to constitute right a power able\r\nto maintain, defend, and vindicate itself.\r\n\r\n{162}\r\n\r\n         Influence Of Religious Ideas.\r\n\r\nWe must not, however, believe that religious ideas exercised no\r\nother influence, in regard to the royal authority, than to extend\r\nit, and to represent it as absolute and springing from divine\r\nright; they contributed powerfully to render it moral. It is\r\ntrue, they rendered it independent of the public liberties, which\r\nwere frequently mere embodiments of arbitrary power and brute\r\nforce, and thus they helped to establish absolute power; but at\r\nthe same time they subordinated it to the divine laws, in which\r\nthe moral laws are comprised. The limits which Frankish usages\r\nimposed on the royal authority were very different from those\r\nassigned to it by Christian ideas: \"the king,\" to use the\r\nexpression of the Councils, \"is he who governs with pity,\r\njustice, and goodness; he who does not govern thus is not a king,\r\nbut a tyrant.\" The restraint which this principle laid upon the\r\nroyal authority was more efficacious than that which resulted\r\nfrom the influence of Frankish usages. This system, it is true,\r\ngave no positive and real guarantee for the observance of the\r\nrules which it imposed as duties upon royalty. But the age in\r\nwhich we live has taken too much pains to seek guarantees in\r\nphysical force, and has neglected to seek for them in the power\r\nof moral ideas. In barbarian times, as all powers, both of kings\r\nand subjects, are almost equally unregulated, they appear bad\r\nguarantees to sensible men, who seek for purer sureties in moral\r\nideas. When, in the epoch of which we are now speaking, the\r\nFranks or Leudes repress the abuse of royal authority, they\r\nrepress it only in virtue of their own powers, and defend their\r\nliberties only out of regard to their own interests, and not in\r\nobedience to any moral idea of justice and of general right. The\r\necclesiastics, on the contrary, speak in the name of the general\r\nideas of justice and humanity. They oppose morality rather than\r\nforce to the abuse of authority. The clergy thus gave utterance\r\nto things which answered to the necessities of all the weak, and\r\nled them to consider them as their protectors. The vice of the\r\nreligious system, doubtless, is that it creates no political\r\ninstitution, and consequently, no effectual guarantee; thus it\r\nalways ends by being more favourable to power than to liberty:\r\nbut, in barbarous ages, when power and liberty were almost\r\nequally brutal and anarchical, this system has rendered immense\r\nservices to humanity and to civilization.\r\n\r\n{163}\r\n\r\n              Lecture XX.\r\n\r\n  National assemblies of the Franks; their primitive character,\r\n  and rapid decline under the Merovingians.\r\n\r\n  They regain importance under the Carlovingians; and are held\r\n  regularly under Charlemagne.\r\n\r\n  Letter of Archbishop Hincmar _De ordine Palatii_.\r\n\r\n\r\n         National Assemblies Of The Franks.\r\n\r\nNational assemblies were held among the Franks long previously to\r\ntheir settlement in the Roman empire, and to the establishment of\r\nmonarchy amongst them. In these assemblies were discussed, in\r\nGermany, all the affairs of the confederation, tribe, or band.\r\nAll the free men, that is to say, all the warriors, were present;\r\nbut the authority of these assemblies, like the authority of the\r\nkings, was uncertain and precarious. They were formed, not in\r\nvirtue of the principle of the sovereignty of the people, but in\r\nvirtue of the right of every free man to have the sole disposal\r\nof himself. They were convoked especially to determine on\r\nmilitary expeditions. Beyond this, every man acted independently,\r\nand was answerable for his conduct to none but the local\r\nauthorities. The _Champ de Mars_, or autumnal assembly, of\r\nwhich we find traces at the beginning of the monarchy, was\r\nhabitually held for the purpose of dividing the booty which had\r\nbeen gained.\r\n\r\nThe dispersion of the free men, the increasing inequality of\r\nsocial conditions, and the subordination of the comrades to their\r\nchief, soon caused the national assemblies of the Franks to lose\r\ntheir character of universality. They ceased to be attended by\r\nany but the large landowners, the Leudes, and the superior\r\nclergy. In this state, they appear to have existed under most of\r\nthe Merovingian kings. Mention is sometimes made of the people in\r\ngeneral; but evidently the great majority of the free men neither\r\ncould, nor did attend these assemblies. Those who possessed power\r\nand wealth were almost the only persons who attended; and they\r\nregulated the business brought under their notice solely with a\r\nview to their own interest. The increasing disorder, and\r\ncontinual dislocations of the kingdom, rendered these assemblies\r\nless frequent.\r\n\r\n{164}\r\n\r\n         Letter Of Archbishop Hincmar.\r\n\r\nThey reappear, however, at the establishment of the authority of\r\nthe Mayors of the Palace. As leaders of the aristocracy of the\r\ngreat independent landowners, they had need of their support. The\r\nsubstitution of a new family of kings, instead of the ancient\r\nrace, was favourable to the importance of the assemblies. They\r\nbecame, under the first Carlovingians, what they had been under\r\nthe first Merovingians,--a great council of government, in which\r\nall great affairs were discussed. Pepin transferred the Champs de\r\nMars to the month of May; and Charlemagne held these assemblies\r\nwith a regularity heretofore unknown.  In order to form a correct\r\nidea of what they were under his reign, you must read the text,\r\nand the entire text, of the letter written in 882, sixty-eight\r\nyears after the death of Charlemagne, by the celebrated Hincmar,\r\narchbishop of Rheims, in compliance with the request of some of\r\nthe nobles of the kingdom who had asked his advice with regard to\r\nthe government of Carloman, one of the sons of Louis the\r\nStammerer. In this letter, Hincmar, as he himself informs us,\r\ndoes nothing but copy a treatise _On the Order of the Palace,\r\nDe ordine Palatii_, written before 826 by the celebrated\r\nAdalhard, abbot of Corbia, and one of the principal advisers of\r\nCharlemagne. It is, therefore, a contemporary document, and its\r\nauthority is great.\r\n\r\n  \"It was the usage at that time,\" says Hincmar, \"to hold in each\r\n  year two assemblies, (_placita_,) and no more. The first\r\n  took place in the spring; at it were regulated the general\r\n  affairs of the whole kingdom; no occurrence, unless it were an\r\n  imperious and universal necessity, could alter what had been\r\n  decreed thereat. In this assembly, met together all the great\r\n  men (_majores_), both lay and ecclesiastic; the more\r\n  influential (_seniores_), to discuss business and agree on\r\n  decisions; the less influential (_minores_), to receive\r\n  these decisions, and sometimes also to deliberate upon them and\r\n  confirm them, not by a formal consent, but by the exercise of\r\n  their opinion and the assent of their understanding.\"\r\n\r\n{165}\r\n\r\n         The Councils Of State.\r\n\r\n  \"The other assembly, in which the general gifts of the realm\r\n  were received, was composed only of the more influential\r\n  members (_seniores_) of the first assembly, and of the\r\n  principal councillors. Here the affairs of the following year\r\n  were treated of, if there were any which it was necessary to\r\n  deliberate upon beforehand; as also those which might have\r\n  occurred during the course of the year which was about to\r\n  expire, and which required provisional attention without delay.\r\n  For example, if, in any part of the kingdom, the governors of\r\n  the frontiers (_marchisi_) had concluded a truce for any\r\n  time, the course to be pursued on the expiration of these\r\n  truces was discussed, and it was determined whether they should\r\n  be renewed or not. If, in any other quarter of the kingdom, war\r\n  seemed imminent, or peace appeared likely to be established, it\r\n  was examined whether the exigencies of the moment required, in\r\n  the first case, that incursions should be commenced or endured,\r\n  and, in the second, how tranquillity might be insured. These\r\n  lords thus deliberated long beforehand on what the affairs of\r\n  the future might require; and when suitable measures had been\r\n  agreed upon, they were kept so secret, that before the next\r\n  general assembly they were no more known than if no one had\r\n  paid any attention to the matter, and no decision had been\r\n  arrived at regarding it. The object of this was, that if it\r\n  were necessary to take, either within or without the kingdom,\r\n  any measures which certain persons, when informed thereof,\r\n  might wish to prevent, or frustrate, or render difficult, by\r\n  any artifice, those persons might never have the power to do\r\n  so.\r\n\r\n  \"In the same assembly, if any measure were necessary either to\r\n  satisfy absent nobles, or to calm or excite the spirit of the\r\n  people, and such measure had not previously been taken, it was\r\n  discussed and adopted by the consent of those present, and it\r\n  was executed in concert with them by the orders of the king.\r\n  The year being thus terminated, the assembly of the following\r\n  year was arranged as I have said.\r\n\r\n{166}\r\n\r\n  \"With regard to the councillors, both lay and ecclesiastic,\r\n  care was taken, as far as possible, to select such persons as,\r\n  from their condition and duties, were filled with the fear of\r\n  God, and animated, moreover, by unalterable fidelity, so as to\r\n  consider nothing superior to the interests of the king and\r\n  kingdom, except eternal life. Men were sought who could be\r\n  turned aside from the path of duty neither by friends, nor\r\n  enemies, nor relatives, nor gifts, nor flatteries, nor\r\n  reproaches; men were sought who were wise and skilful, not with\r\n  that sophistical skill and worldly wisdom which are so opposed\r\n  to God's will, but with a just and true wisdom that might\r\n  enable them not only to repress, but also fully to confound the\r\n  men who place all their reliance in the tricks and stratagems\r\n  of human policy. The maxim of the councillors thus elected, and\r\n  of the king himself, was, never to confide, without their\r\n  mutual consent, to their domestics or any other person, what\r\n  they might have said familiarly to one another, either upon the\r\n  affairs of the kingdom, or about any particular individuals. It\r\n  made no difference whether the secret ought to be kept for a\r\n  day or two, or more, or for a year, or even for ever.\r\n\r\n  \"It invariably happens that, if the conversation held in such\r\n  meetings, with regard to any individual, either by way of\r\n  precaution, or in reference to any other public interest, come\r\n  afterwards to the knowledge of that individual, he cannot but\r\n  feel great anxiety, or be driven to despair thereby, or, which\r\n  is a much more serious matter, be stimulated to infidelity; and\r\n  thus a man who might perhaps still have done service to the\r\n  State, is rendered useless,--which never would have happened if\r\n  he had not known what was said about him. That which is true of\r\n  one man may be true of two, of a hundred, or of a greater\r\n  number, or of a whole family, or of an entire province, unless\r\n  the greatest caution be observed.\r\n\r\n\r\n         The Officers Of The Palace.\r\n\r\n  \"The _apocrisiary_, that is, the chaplain or keeper of the\r\n  palace, and the _chamberlain_, were always present at\r\n  these councils; they were therefore chosen with the greatest\r\n  care; or else, after having been chosen, they were furnished\r\n  with such instructions as should render them worthy of being\r\n  present. As to the other officers of the palace\r\n  (_ministeriales_), if there were any one who, first by\r\n  gaining instruction, and afterwards by giving advice, proved\r\n  himself capable of honourably occupying the place of one of\r\n  these councillors, or fit to become one, he received orders to\r\n  attend the meetings, giving the greatest attention to the\r\n  matters discussed thereat, correcting his erroneous ideas,\r\n  learning that of which he was ignorant, and retaining in his\r\n  memory that which had been ordained and determined.\r\n{167}\r\n  The object of this was, that, if any unforeseen accident\r\n  occurred, either within or without the kingdom; if any\r\n  unexpected news arrived, in reference to which previous\r\n  provision had not been made (it rarely happened, however, that\r\n  in such cases, profound deliberation was necessary, or that\r\n  there was not time to convoke the councillors already\r\n  mentioned); the object of this, I say, was that, under such\r\n  circumstances, the officers of the palace, with the grace of\r\n  God, and by their constant habit of both attending at the\r\n  public councils and deliberating upon the domestic affairs of\r\n  the realm, might be capable, as need was, either to advise what\r\n  had best be done, or to point out how matters might be arranged\r\n  without inconvenience, until the next meeting of the council.\r\n  So much with regard to the principal officers of the palace.\r\n\r\n         The Palatines.\r\n\r\n  \"In reference to the inferior officers, properly called\r\n  _palatines_, who had not to do with the general affairs of\r\n  the kingdom, but only with those in which the persons specially\r\n  connected with the palace were concerned, the sovereign\r\n  regulated their duties with great care; in order that, not only\r\n  might no evil arise therefrom, but also that if any disorder\r\n  were manifested, it might at once be repressed and extirpated.\r\n  If the affair were urgent, but might nevertheless without\r\n  injustice or wrong to any person be deferred for decision until\r\n  the meeting of the general assembly, the emperor expected the\r\n  _palatines_ to indicate the best means of delay, and to\r\n  imitate the wisdom of their superiors in a manner pleasing to\r\n  God and useful to the kingdom. As to the councillors whom I\r\n  first mentioned, they were careful, when summoned to the\r\n  palace, not to occupy themselves with private affairs, or with\r\n  the disputes which might have arisen with regard to the\r\n  possession of property or the application of the law, until\r\n  they had arranged, with the help of God, everything that\r\n  concerned the king and kingdom in general. This being done, if,\r\n  in obedience to the orders of the king, there remained any\r\n  affair which could not be settled either by the Count of the\r\n  palace, or by the officer under whose cognizance it fell,\r\n  without the assistance of the councillors, they proceeded to\r\n  investigate it.\r\n\r\n{168}\r\n\r\n         The Capitularies.\r\n\r\n  \"At one or other of the two assemblies, and in order that they\r\n  might not appear to be convoked without reason, there were\r\n  submitted to the examination and deliberation of the great\r\n  personages whom I have mentioned, as well as of the chief\r\n  senators of the realm, and in virtue of the orders of the king,\r\n  those articles of law named _capitula_, which the king\r\n  himself had drawn up under the inspiration of God, or the\r\n  necessity of which had been manifested to him in the interval\r\n  between the meetings. After having received these\r\n  communications, they deliberated upon them for one, two, or\r\n  three days, or more, according to the importance of the matter.\r\n  Messengers from the palace, going and coming, received their\r\n  questions and brought back answers; and no stranger approached\r\n  the place of their meeting, until the result of their\r\n  deliberations was placed before the eyes of the great prince,\r\n  who then, with the wisdom which he had received from God,\r\n  adopted a resolution which all obeyed. This course was pursued\r\n  for one, two, or more capitularies, until, by the help of God,\r\n  all the necessities of the time had been duly regulated.\r\n\r\n  \"Whilst these affairs were thus arranged out of the presence of\r\n  the king, the prince himself, in the midst of the multitude who\r\n  had come to the general assembly, was busied in receiving\r\n  presents, greeting the most important individuals, conversing\r\n  with those whom he saw but seldom, exhibiting an affectionate\r\n  interest in the old, laughing and joking with the young, and\r\n  doing these and similar things to ecclesiastics as well as\r\n  laymen. However, if those who were deliberating upon the\r\n  matters submitted to their judgment desired it, the king went\r\n  to them, and remained with them as long as they wished; and\r\n  there they reported to him, with entire familiarity, what they\r\n  thought of various matters, and what were the friendly\r\n  discussions which had arisen amongst them.\r\n\r\n  \"I must not forget to mention that, if the weather were fine,\r\n  all this went on in the open air; but if not, in several\r\n  distinct buildings, by which those who had to deliberate upon\r\n  the king's propositions were separated from the multitude of\r\n  persons who had come to the assembly; and then the less\r\n  important men could not enter. The building intended for the\r\n  meeting of the nobles was divided into two parts, so that the\r\n  bishops, abbots, and superior clergy could meet together\r\n  without any mixture of laymen. In the same way, the counts and\r\n  other distinguished personages of the State separated\r\n  themselves, in the morning, from the rest of the multitude,\r\n  until the time came, when, whether the king were present or\r\n  absent, they all met together; and then the nobles\r\n  above-mentioned, the clergy on their side, and the laymen on\r\n  theirs, proceeded to the hall which was assigned to them, and\r\n  where seats had been honourably prepared for them.\r\n{169}\r\n  When the lay and ecclesiastical lords were thus separated from\r\n  the multitude, it was in their power to sit either together or\r\n  separately, according to the nature of the affairs which they\r\n  had to discuss, whether ecclesiastical, secular, or mixed. In\r\n  the same way, if they wished to send for any one, either to\r\n  bring them food, or to answer any question, and to dismiss him\r\n  after having obtained what they desired, it was in their power\r\n  to do so. Thus proceeded the examination of the affairs which\r\n  the king proposed for their deliberation.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Duties Of The King.\r\n\r\n  \"The second occupation of the king was to demand of each what\r\n  he had to report or relate to him regarding that part of the\r\n  kingdom from which he had come; not only was this permitted to\r\n  all, but they were specially enjoined to make inquiries, during\r\n  the interval between the assemblies, about what was going on\r\n  both within and without the kingdom; and they were to seek\r\n  information from foreigners as well as natives, from enemies as\r\n  well as friends, sometimes by employing envoys, and without\r\n  being very scrupulous as to the way in which the information\r\n  was obtained. The king desired to know whether in any district\r\n  or corner of his kingdom the people were murmuring or\r\n  disaffected, and what was the cause of their disaffection, and\r\n  whether any disorder had occurred which required the attention\r\n  of the general council, and other similar details. He also\r\n  sought to know whether any of the conquered nations were likely\r\n  to revolt, or whether any that had revolted seemed disposed to\r\n  submit, or whether those that still remained independent\r\n  threatened the kingdom with any attack, and so forth. Upon all\r\n  these matters, wherever disorder or danger appeared, his chief\r\n  care was to learn what was the motive or occasion thereof.\"\r\n\r\n{170}\r\n\r\n         Policy Of Charlemagne.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that these assemblies were considered by\r\nCharlemagne as an instrument of authority, order, and\r\nadministration, much rather than as a national institution\r\nrendered necessary by the rights and free spirit of his people.\r\nThe employment of this means of government, however, does not do\r\nthe less honour to the genius of Charlemagne. He had perceived\r\nthat the principal vice of the social system of his time, and the\r\nprincipal cause of the weakness of his own authority, were the\r\nabsence of concentration, the isolation of individuals, and the\r\nindependence of his agents. Periodical convocations gave a centre\r\nto all. The efforts of a great man in a barbarous age have as\r\ntheir especial object the creation of a nation, for therein lies\r\nhis power; Charlemagne sought to find his nation lower than among\r\nthe great landowners and the great beneficiaries. He wished to\r\nrally together the entire mass of the people, in order to\r\nincrease his own power, and to have at his disposal everywhere\r\npotent means of action. His was a skilful despotism. Despotism,\r\nin barbarous times, sometimes announces the presence of a man who\r\nis before his age, and who has necessities and views in relation\r\nto the future. Despotism, in the midst of an advanced state of\r\ncivilization, indicates the presence of a man who may be great\r\nand even necessary to society, but who cares only for himself,\r\nand for the times in which he lives.\r\n\r\n{171}\r\n\r\n              Lecture XXI.\r\n\r\n  Decay of national assemblies under Louis the Débonnair and\r\n  Charles the Bald.\r\n\r\n  Definitive predominance of the feudal system at the end of the\r\n  tenth century.\r\n\r\n  Cause of this predominance.\r\n\r\n  Character of feudalism.\r\n\r\n  No trace of true representative government in France, from the\r\n  fifth to the tenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Decay Of National Assemblies.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Charlemagne, and under Louis the Débonnair,\r\nnational assemblies were still frequently held. The movement\r\nwhich Charlemagne had begun, had not yet entirely ceased. Unable\r\nto create, Louis the Débonnair sought to imitate; at the spring\r\nor autumn assemblies, he passed several useful rules, amongst\r\nothers the capitulary which summoned the _scabini_, or royal\r\njudges, to the Champs de Mai. But the government, even with this\r\nsanction, was lifeless and inefficient. The assemblies had been\r\nnothing but an instrument of the monarch, and the monarch was now\r\nno longer able to make use of them. Their decay was complete\r\nunder Charles the Bald. They began again to be nothing more than\r\nmeetings of the bishops and the great lay landowners. There were\r\nforty-six assemblies held under Charles the Bald; but they were\r\nalmost all confined to the negotiations of the great nobles with\r\nthe king, respecting their private interests. Such was the\r\nprogress made by feudalism that the central aristocracy of the\r\ngreat landowners, beneficiaries, and others, dissolved of itself.\r\nThey isolated themselves from one another in order to exercise,\r\neach in his own domains, the almost absolute sovereignty which\r\nthey had acquired. The fall of the Carlovingians was the work of\r\nHugh Capet alone, and not of an aristocratic coalition. An\r\nassembly did not meet, as at the fall of the Merovingians, to\r\nelect a new king. Hugh Capet made himself king, and was\r\nacknowledged as such, first by the vassals whom he possessed as\r\nDuke of France, and afterwards, successively, by the great lords\r\nof the kingdom, who remained, nevertheless, almost his equals in\r\npower. Then the assemblies almost entirely disappeared, together\r\nwith every national and central institution; and nearly three\r\ncenturies elapsed before anything analogous to them was\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\n{172}\r\n\r\n         Retrospect Of Five Centuries.\r\n\r\nThus, at the end of the tenth century, of the three systems of\r\ninstitutions which we characterized at the outset, viz.: free\r\ninstitutions, monarchical institutions, and feudal institutions,\r\nthe last had completely prevailed; the first had perished early,\r\nand Charlemagne had vainly attempted to establish the second. The\r\nhierarchical organization of the proprietors of estates, and the\r\ndislocation of France into as many petty sovereignties as there\r\nwere proprietors sufficiently strong to be almost independent and\r\nabsolute masters in their own domains,--such was the natural\r\nresult of the settlement of the Franks in Gaul.\r\n\r\nDuring the five centuries which we have now briefly examined,\r\ninstitutions, customs, and powers appear to be in a constant\r\nstate of disorder and conflict. The ancient liberties of the\r\nFranks, the primitive independence of the warriors, royal\r\nauthority, the first rudiments of the feudal system,--all these\r\ndifferent elements present themselves to our view as obscure,\r\nincoherent, and in opposition. We pass incessantly from one\r\nsystem to another, from one tendency to another. At the end of\r\nthe tenth century, the struggle has almost ceased; the mass of\r\nthe population have fallen into a state of serfage, or become\r\ntributary colonists; the possession of fiefs confers a real\r\nsovereignty, more or less complete according to the power of the\r\npossessor; these petty sovereigns are hierarchically united and\r\nconstituted by the bonds of suzerainty and vassalage. Nowhere is\r\nthis bond weaker than between the king and his vassals; for there\r\nthe pretensions to authority on the one hand, and to independence\r\non the other, are most earnestly contested.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental characteristics of this state of things are the\r\ndestruction of all centrality, both national and monarchic; the\r\nhierarchical constitution of landed property; the distribution of\r\nsovereignty according to the various degrees of this hierarchy;\r\nand the servitude or quasi-servitude of the mass of the\r\ninhabitants of the country.\r\n\r\n{173}\r\n\r\n         Attacks On The Feudal System.\r\n\r\nI have said that this system was the natural result of the\r\ncondition of the Franks in Gaul after the conquest; its\r\ndefinitive success is proof of this. Another circumstance, also,\r\nmay be adduced in evidence. Before the tenth century, we witness\r\nthe constant struggle and alternating success of free,\r\nmonarchical, and feudal institutions. The efforts made in favour\r\nof the first two systems, although some were supported by the\r\nancient independence of the Franks, and others by the ability of\r\ngreat kings, were unsuccessful,--a more powerful tendency\r\nfrustrated and overcame them. When the struggle ceased, when the\r\nfeudal system had fully prevailed, a new conflict almost\r\nimmediately commenced; the victorious system was attacked: in the\r\ninferior classes of society, by the mass of the inhabitants,\r\ncitizens, colonists, or serfs, who strove to regain some rights,\r\nsome property, and some liberty; in the superior class, by\r\nroyalty, which laboured to resume some general sway, and to\r\nbecome once more the centre of the nation. These new efforts were\r\nmade, not, as during the period from the fifth to the tenth\r\ncentury, in the midst of the confusion arising from the conflict\r\nof opposing systems, but in the very interior of a single system,\r\nof the system which had prevailed over, and taken possession of,\r\nthe whole of society. The combatants are no longer free men,\r\nuncertain of their position and their rights, who feebly defend\r\nthe wreck of their ancient existence against the overpowering\r\ninvasion of the feudal system; they are citizens, colonists,\r\nserfs, whose condition is clear and determined, who become in\r\ntheir turn aggressors, and labour to free themselves from the\r\nyoke of feudalism. We no longer behold the king uncertain of his\r\nauthority, and subject to have it unceasingly attacked, not\r\nknowing whether he is king or lord, and defending his power\r\nagainst the Leudes, or great landowners, who attempt sometimes to\r\ninfringe it, and sometimes to set it aside altogether; now it is\r\nthe chief of the nobles labouring to make himself the king of\r\nall, and to convert suzerainty into sovereignty. From the fifth\r\nto the tenth century, the feudal system had been in progress, in\r\ndevelopment, and in aggression. From the eleventh century\r\nonwards, this system had to defend itself against the people and\r\nthe king. The struggle was long, difficult, and terrible; but the\r\nresults altered with the position of the combatants. In spite of\r\nthe servitude into which the people fell in the tenth century,\r\nfrom that time forth the enfranchisement of the people made\r\nprogress.\r\n{174}\r\nNotwithstanding the impotence of the royal power at the same\r\nperiod, thenceforward the royal power gained ground. No effort\r\nwas vain, no step was retrograde. That monarchical system which\r\nthe genius of Charlemagne had been unable to establish, was\r\ngradually founded by kings far inferior to Charlemagne. Those\r\nancient liberties, which neither Franks nor Gauls had been able\r\nto preserve, were regained piecemeal by the commons and the third\r\nestate. During the first period, monarchy and liberty had failed\r\nto establish their position; it was destined that monarchy should\r\nissue out of feudalism itself, and that emancipation should\r\nspring from the bosom of servitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Character Of Feudalism.\r\n\r\nWith regard to feudalism itself, it is not my intention to sketch\r\nits history. I hasten to arrive at that period at which I shall\r\nagain meet with a nation and a king, and at which endeavours\r\nafter a free government and a monarchical system will recommence.\r\nI will only state here what were the dominant character and\r\ngeneral influence of the feudal system, in relation to power and\r\nliberty--those two constituent elements of social order.\r\n\r\nThe feudal system brought the master into close connection with\r\nthe subject, and the sovereign with those who depended upon him;\r\nin this sense it was a cause of oppression and servitude. It is\r\ndifficult to escape from a power that is ever near, and almost\r\npresent. The human will is subject to strange caprices, and never\r\nis this more frequently exemplified than when the objects on\r\nwhich it acts are in its power. You may breathe a little under an\r\narbitrary power, if it be very lofty and very distant; but if it\r\nbe at your elbow, you are truly a slave. Local tyranny is the\r\nworst of all; though difficult to avoid, it can easily defend\r\nitself. A handful of men have often kept the population of a\r\nlarge town in servitude for ages. The citizens, colonists, and\r\nserfs felt themselves so grievously oppressed by the feudal lords\r\nthat they preferred to their absolute power the absolute power of\r\nthe kings, even with more extensive and irresistible rights than\r\nthose possessed by the lords. A certain and general despotism has\r\nneither the same interest in being tyrannical, nor the same means\r\nof oppression. This will explain the intensity of feudal\r\noppression, and the profound hatred which it inspired.\r\n\r\n{175}\r\n\r\n         Influence Of Feudalism.\r\n\r\nThe feudal system placed the inferior near his superior; and, in\r\nthis sense, it was a principle of dignity and liberty. Many\r\nvassals were equal in rank to each other, and on terms of\r\nfamiliarity; frequently the inequality between the superior and\r\ninferior was not great, so that the latter was neither humiliated\r\nthereby, nor obliged to play the courtier. Protection was a\r\nright; the suzerain had absolute need of his vassals. There was\r\nno room, in their relations to one another, for servility and\r\nbaseness of soul. Moreover, the vassals had reasons and means for\r\nbanding together to defend themselves against oppression; they\r\npossessed common rights and interests. The intimacy in which they\r\nlived with their lord prevented the feeling of their mutual\r\nrights from becoming effaced within them; thus feudal relations\r\nare generally full of dignity and high-spiritedness; a noble\r\nsentiment, fidelity instead of submission, guides their conduct.\r\nNow, wherever a profound moral sentiment exists, it must\r\nnecessarily call others into action; hence the many splendid and\r\nhonourable developments of human nature under the feudal system:\r\nthese developments were concentrated, it is true, within the\r\ncircle of the lords and vassals; but even that is better than the\r\nequal abasement of all under an universal despotism.\r\n\r\nThus, whilst feudalism disregarded and insulted both justice and\r\nthe dignity of man among the masses whom it claimed as subjects,\r\nit respected and developed both among its own hierarchy. In this\r\nhierarchy, liberty existed, with all its accompaniments. Below\r\nwere servitude and its attendant evils, with all the shames that\r\nfollow in their train.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Absence Of The Representative System.\r\n\r\nI may now fearlessly affirm that, in the institutions of the\r\nperiod from the fifth to the tenth century, there is no trace of\r\nthe representative system. We pass from the independence of\r\nindividuals, sometimes to the power of the king, sometimes to the\r\npredominance of the great landowners. But there is no political\r\norganization founded upon ideas of general law and public\r\ninterest; all institutions have reference to private rights and\r\ninterests. Two opposite forces are in conflict; there is nothing\r\nto reveal the division of powers, and their tendency towards one\r\ncommon object.\r\n{176}\r\nThere are no representatives of the rights of all; none elected\r\nin the name of the interests of all; those who have rights\r\nexercise them personally; those who do not exercise them\r\npersonally do not possess them. The ecclesiastics alone preserve\r\nthe idea of the general right of all men to justice and to good\r\ngovernment; but this idea is not transfused into any\r\ninstitutions. Neither the philosophic principle, nor any of the\r\ntrue external characteristics of representative government, can\r\nanywhere be met with.\r\n\r\n{177}\r\n\r\n              Lecture XXII.\r\n\r\n  Political institutions of the Visigoths.\r\n\r\n  Peculiar character of Visigothic legislation.\r\n\r\n  Its authors and its influences.\r\n\r\n  Destruction and disappearance of the middle class in the Roman\r\n  empire, at the time of the Barbarian invasion.\r\n\r\n  History of the Roman municipal system.\r\n\r\n  Three epochs in that history.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Laws Of The Visigoths.\r\n\r\nIn conformity to the plan which I sketched out for our guidance\r\nat the commencement of these lectures, I have studied with you\r\nthe political institutions of the Anglo-Saxons and Franks, from\r\nthe fifth to the tenth century. I now come to those of the\r\nVisigoths, the third of the Barbarian peoples established in the\r\nRoman empire, about whom I propose to give you some information.\r\n\r\nOn opening the collection of the laws of the Visigoths, it is\r\nimpossible not to be struck with the compactness which\r\ndistinguishes them. The Franks and Burgundians have laws\r\npartially anterior to their establishment upon the Roman\r\nterritory; customs handed down and gathered together from age to\r\nage. The Visigoths have a code which was systematically drawn up,\r\nand promulgated on an appointed day.\r\n\r\nThis fact alone indicates that the laws of the Visigoths were not\r\nthe work of the Barbarians themselves. The influence of the\r\nclergy, indeed, was more potent among the Visigoths than among\r\nthe other Barbarian conquerors; not only did the clergy take part\r\nin their government, but they acted as their civil and political\r\nlegislators. The Visigothic code was their work. How did this\r\nhappen?\r\n\r\nBefore the foundation of the Barbarian States, under the dominion\r\neven of the last Roman emperors, the power of the new religion\r\ngradually placed the Christian clergy at the head of the peoples;\r\nthe bishop was the defender and chief of the towns. After the\r\nconquest, the Barbarians embraced the religion of the vanquished;\r\nand as the Christian clergy were powerful in the towns, by virtue\r\nof the municipal institutions, they used every effort to preserve\r\nto the municipal system its form and efficacy.\r\n{178}\r\nIn this they succeeded to a great extent. It is therefore of\r\nessential importance to have some precise knowledge of the Roman\r\nmunicipal system and its vicissitudes until the period of the\r\ngreat Barbarian invasions, in order properly to understand the\r\ncondition of the urban populations at that epoch, and the part\r\nwhich their clergy played in their new position, especially in\r\nthe kingdom of the Visigoths.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Fall Of The Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nAs I have already observed, the fall of the Roman empire in the\r\nWest is a strange phenomenon. Not only did the population not\r\nsupport the government in its struggles against the Barbarians,\r\nbut the population, when left to itself, did not attempt any\r\nresistance on its own behalf. More than this--nothing, during\r\nthis protracted conflict, revealed the existence of a nation;\r\nscarce any allusion is made to what it suffered; it endured all\r\nthe scourges of war, pillage, and famine, and suffered an entire\r\nchange in its destiny and condition, without acting, speaking, or\r\neven appearing.\r\n\r\nThis phenomenon is not merely strange, it is unexampled.\r\nDespotism has reigned elsewhere than in the Roman empire; more\r\nthan once, foreign invasion and conquest have devastated\r\ncountries that had long groaned beneath a tyrannical government.\r\nEven where the nation has not resisted, its existence has been\r\nmanifested in some manner in history. It suffers, it complains,\r\nand, notwithstanding its humiliation, it struggles against its\r\nevil fate; narratives and monuments attest what it experienced,\r\nwhat it became, and if not what it did, at least what was done\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nIn the fifth century, the remnants of the Roman legions disputed\r\nwith hordes of Barbarians the possession of the immense territory\r\nof the empire, but it seemed as if this territory were a desert.\r\nWhen the soldiers of the empire had departed or been defeated,\r\nmention is made of no other person or thing. The Barbarian tribes\r\nseize upon the provinces in succession; beside them, facts\r\nexhibit to us only one other real and living existence, that of\r\nthe bishops and the clergy. If the laws did not remain to inform\r\nus that a Roman population still covered the soil, history would\r\ngive us good reason to doubt its existence.\r\n\r\n{179}\r\n\r\n         State Of The Roman Colonies.\r\n\r\nIt was especially in the provinces which had long been subject to\r\nRome, and wherein civilization was more advanced, that the people\r\nthus disappeared. We look upon the letter of the Britons,\r\ntearfully imploring the assistance of Aetius and the despatch of\r\na legion, as a singular monument of the cowardice of the subjects\r\nof the empire. This astonishment is unjust: the Britons, being\r\nless civilized and less Romanized than the other subjects of the\r\nempire, resisted the Saxons, and their resistance has a history.\r\nAt the same period, under similar circumstances, the Italians,\r\nthe Gauls, and the Spaniards have no history; the empire withdrew\r\nitself from their country, and the Barbarians took possession of\r\nit, without the mass of the inhabitants taking the least part in\r\nthe transaction, or giving the slightest indication of the place\r\nthey occupied in the events which gave them over to so many\r\nscourges.\r\n\r\nNevertheless Gaul, Italy, and Spain were covered with towns,\r\nwhich had lately been wealthy and populous; civilization had\r\nthere received a splendid development; roads, aqueducts,\r\ncircuses, and schools, were abundant. Everything that can attest\r\nwealth, or procure for a nation an animated and brilliant\r\nexistence, they possessed. The invasions of the Barbarians\r\noccurred to pillage them of all their wealth, to disperse all\r\ntheir friendly meetings, to destroy all their pleasures. Never\r\nhad the existence of a nation been more completely overthrown;\r\nnever had individuals had more evils to endure and more dangers\r\nto apprehend. Whence came it that the populations were dumb and\r\ndead? How is it that so many sacked towns, so many ruined\r\npositions, so many blasted careers, so many ejected proprietors,\r\nhave left so few traces, I do not say of their active resistance,\r\nbut only of their sufferings?\r\n\r\nThe despotism of the imperial government, the degraded condition\r\nof the people, the profound apathy which had seized upon both\r\nmasters and subjects, have been alleged to account for this--and\r\njustly so: therein consisted the great cause of this strange\r\nphenomenon. But it is easy thus to enunciate in a general manner\r\na cause which, though apparently in existence elsewhere, did not\r\nelsewhere produce the same results. We must penetrate more deeply\r\ninto the state of Roman society, in the condition to which it had\r\nbeen reduced by despotism. We must inquire by what means it had\r\nbeen so utterly deprived of all consistency and life.\r\n\r\n{180}\r\n\r\n         Roman Municipal System.\r\n\r\nDespotism can clothe itself in very different forms, and exhibit\r\nitself in proceedings which impart to its action a far higher\r\nenergy, and give a far wider scope to its consequences.\r\n\r\nThe great fact which had resulted from the system of imperial\r\ndespotism, and which alone can explain the phenomenon of which I\r\nspeak, is the destruction and disappearance of the middle class\r\nfrom the Roman world: at the arrival of the Barbarians, this\r\nclass no longer existed; and for this reason also, the nation had\r\nceased to exist. This annihilation of the middle class in the\r\nRoman empire was especially the result of a municipal system,\r\nwhich had rendered it completely the instrument and the victim of\r\nthe imperial despotism. All the batteries of that despotism were\r\ndirected against this class; and it was imprisoned within the\r\nmunicipal system that it might be turned to account, and made to\r\nsupply the necessities of the existence of the power that crushed\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSuch a fact renders it worth while to study, in all its parts,\r\nthe machine by which it was produced. Those who are unacquainted\r\nwith the organization of the municipal system at this period, and\r\nits effects upon Roman society, cannot properly understand the\r\nhistory of these times.\r\n\r\nIn the constitution and existence of cities, within the Roman\r\nworld, we may discern three epochs, very distinct from each\r\nother, and clearly marked out by actual revolutions. It is well\r\nknown that the Romans, adopting, in their conquests, a system\r\nwidely different from that of most ancient nations, were careful\r\nnot to exterminate or reduce to servitude the nations which they\r\nhad conquered. This difference of procedure was, I think,\r\noccasioned by the condition of most of the neighbouring nations,\r\nagainst which Rome first waged war. They were collected together\r\nin towns, and not dispersed throughout the country; they formed\r\ncivic bodies, cultivating and governing a territory of greater or\r\nless extent. These cities were numerous and independent. A nation\r\nscattered over the land which it cultivates, may easily be\r\ndestroyed or enslaved; but the task is more difficult and less\r\nprofitable when that nation dwells within walls and has already\r\nassumed the consistency of a petty State.\r\n{181}\r\nMoreover, the nations which, in ancient times, were enslaved or\r\nexterminated, received this treatment almost invariably from\r\nconquerors who were in search of a home, and who had settled in\r\nthe territory they had won. When the war was ended, the Romans\r\nreturned to Rome. Enslavement and extermination cannot be\r\neffected either all at once or from a distance. The victors who\r\nintend to do this must be ever present among the vanquished,\r\nceaselessly depriving them of their wealth, their liberty, and\r\ntheir lands. The primitive condition of the Romans, at the\r\ncommencement of their conquests, exercised a decisive influence\r\nupon the fate of nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Treatment Of Conquered Towns.\r\n\r\nOriginally, it does not appear that the Romans ventured to leave\r\ntheir former inhabitants in the conquered towns. It is said that\r\nviolence supplied Rome with women; the same proceeding furnished\r\nher with new citizens. The vanquished, when transferred to Rome,\r\nbecame Romans like their victors. The conquered town was\r\noccupied, either by soldiers, or by inhabitants of Rome,\r\nbelonging to the lowest class of the people, and sent thither to\r\nform a kind of colony. The town of Cœre was the first which, on\r\nbeing united to Rome, was allowed to retain its own laws and\r\nmagistrates after receiving, at least in part, the right of Roman\r\ncitizenship. According to Livy, in the year of Rome 365, a decree\r\nof the Senate ordained _ut cum Cœretibus publice hospitium\r\nfieret_.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Admission To Citizenship.\r\n\r\nThis system prevailed and received continual development. The\r\nconquered towns were united to Rome by receiving the right of\r\ncitizenship. Some of them, like Cœre, only received the title of\r\nRoman citizens for their inhabitants, and still retained their\r\nown Senate and laws; others were admitted into the Roman city,\r\nbut without obtaining the right of suffrage in the _comitia_\r\nof Rome. With regard to others, again, their political\r\nincorporation was complete; their inhabitants enjoyed the right\r\nof suffrage at Rome like the Romans themselves. These last alone\r\nhad a tribe in Rome.\r\n\r\nThe right of suffrage was granted successively to several towns\r\nwhich had not received it at first. Finally, all Italy after the\r\nwar of the allies, and ere long a portion of Southern Gaul\r\nreceived the right of Roman citizenship in all its plenitude.\r\n\r\n{182}\r\n\r\nThe towns thus admitted to all the rights of Roman citizenship\r\nwere called _municipia_. When the whole of Italy was\r\ninvested with these rights, those towns which had not at first\r\nfully possessed them retained for a considerable period the names\r\nof _coloniæ, prefectures_, and so forth, which they had\r\noriginally borne; but, in fact, their condition was completely\r\nassimilated to that of the ancient _municipia_.\r\n\r\nOut of Italy, the condition of the conquered towns and districts\r\nwas still very various. History tells us of _coloniæ_, some\r\nof which were Roman, and others Latin, of _populi liberi_,\r\n_civitates fæderatæ, reges amici, provinciæ_. These\r\ndifferent denominations indicated different modes of existence\r\nunder the domination of Rome, and different degrees of dependence\r\n--but these differences successively disappeared. I am referring\r\nmerely to the _municipia_.\r\n\r\nBefore conferring on a town the full rights of Roman citizenship,\r\ninquiry was made whether it would accept them or not. On consent\r\nbeing given, and, to use the legal phrase, _ubi fundus ei legi\r\nfactus erat_, the concession took place. Its principal\r\nconsequences were these: municipal rights, interests and offices,\r\nin that town, were then separated from political rights, interest\r\nand offices. The former remained in possession of the town, and\r\nwere exercised on the spot by the inhabitants, with entire\r\nindependence: the latter were transferred to Rome, and could be\r\nexercised only within its walls. Thus, the right of making peace\r\nor war, of passing laws, levying taxes, and administering\r\njustice, ceased to belong to the _municipium_ individually;\r\nbut the citizens shared these rights, and exercised them at Rome\r\nin common with the citizens who inhabited Rome; they repaired\r\nthither to vote at the _comitia_, both upon the laws and\r\nupon appointments to magisterial functions: they sought and might\r\nobtain all the offices of the State. The city of Rome possessed\r\nthe privilege that these political rights could be exercised only\r\nwithin its walls. Its inhabitants possessed no privilege above\r\nthose of the _municipia_.\r\n\r\nThe rights, interests, and offices, which we now call municipal,\r\nand the entire disposal of which was secured to each locality,\r\nare nowhere regularly distinguished and enumerated. At this\r\ndegree of civilization, neither the rulers nor the ruled feel the\r\nnecessity of foreseeing, defining, and regulating everything;\r\nthey trust to the good sense of mankind, and to the nature of\r\nthings. History, however, indicates the principal prerogatives\r\nwhich continued local.\r\n\r\n{183}\r\n\r\n  1. Worship, religious festivals, and ceremonies. Not only did\r\n  each town retain its ancient usages and independent authority\r\n  in this respect, but the Roman laws watched over the\r\n  preservation of these rights, and even made it a duty. Each\r\n  _municipium_, therefore, had its own priests and flamens,\r\n  as well as the right of choosing them, and of regulating all\r\n  matters in relation thereto.\r\n\r\n  2. Every _municipium_ also possessed the administration of\r\n  its own private property and revenues. In ceasing to be a\r\n  political personage, it became a civil personage. Public\r\n  edifices, whether devoted to purposes of utility or of\r\n  pleasure, festivals, local and general amusements, all expenses\r\n  of this kind, and all the revenues by which they were defrayed,\r\n  continued to be absolutely local matters. The inhabitants\r\n  appointed the magistrates who were charged with these\r\n  functions.\r\n\r\n  3. The police also remained, to a certain extent at least, in\r\n  the hands of the local magistrates; they had to watch over the\r\n  internal security of their town, and provisionally to arrest\r\n  those who disturbed its peace.\r\n\r\n  4. Although the judicial power had been withdrawn from the\r\n  localities, we nevertheless meet with some traces of a\r\n  Jurisdiction somewhat similar to that which we call municipal\r\n  police, giving judgment upon offences against the laws, with\r\n  regard to public health, weights and measures, markets, and so\r\n  forth.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Municipal Officers.\r\n\r\nAll these local affairs were managed either by magistrates\r\nappointed by the inhabitants, or by the _curia_ of the town\r\nor _college of decurions_, that is, of all the inhabitants\r\nwho possessed a fixed landed income. In general, the _curia_\r\nappointed the magistrates; we meet with some instances, however,\r\nof their being appointed by the general body of the inhabitants.\r\nBut at this period, and by a necessary consequence of the\r\nexistence of slavery, there were few free men who did not belong\r\nto the _curia_.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the word _decurio_ is uncertain. Some writers\r\nare of opinion that he was an officer placed at the head of ten\r\nfamilies, like the _tything-man_, or _tunginus_ of the\r\nGerman peoples. Others think that _decurio_ simply means\r\nmember of a _curia_. The last interpretation seems to me the\r\nmore probable of the two. At a later period, the decurions were\r\ncalled _curiales_.\r\n\r\n{184}\r\n\r\n         Constitution Of The Municipia.\r\n\r\nSuch was the constitution of the _municipia_ at the end of\r\nthe Roman republic. It presents, as results, the following\r\ngeneral facts:\r\n\r\n  1. All political rights and interests, all political life, in\r\n  short, was centralized at Rome, not merely morally and by law,\r\n  but materially and in fact. Within the walls of Rome alone\r\n  could be consummated all the acts of a Roman citizen.\r\n\r\n  2. No centralization of this kind had taken place in reference\r\n  to what we now call administrative interests. Each town had\r\n  remained isolated and distinct in this respect, regulating its\r\n  own affairs, just as a private individual would do.\r\n\r\n  3. The appointment and surveillance of the magistrates who\r\n  administered the local affairs of the town took place on the\r\n  spot, without any intervention of the central power, and by the\r\nassembly of the principal inhabitants.\r\n\r\n  4. Into this assembly were admitted all the inhabitants who\r\n  possessed a certain income. There is reason to believe that a\r\n  few free men only were excluded therefrom.\r\n\r\nHere begins a second epoch in the history of the Roman municipal\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThe absolute separation of political from local existence, and\r\nthe impossibility of exercising political rights elsewhere than\r\nin Rome, could not fail to deprive the towns of their principal\r\ncitizens, and also of a great part of their importance. Thus,\r\nduring the epoch which we have just surveyed, purely local\r\ninterests occupied only a small place. Rome absorbed everything.\r\nThe independence left to other towns, as regarded matters that\r\nwere not treated of at Rome, or did not emanate from Rome, arose\r\nfrom the slight importance of those matters.\r\n\r\nWhen liberty began to totter at Rome, the decadence of the\r\npolitical activity of the citizens necessarily diminished its\r\nconcentration. The chief men of the _municipia_ repaired to\r\nRome to take their part in the government of the world, either by\r\nvoting in the _comitia_, or discharging great public\r\nfunctions. When the _comitia_ and the high magistracies\r\nceased to have any perceptible influence in the government, when\r\npolitical life became extinct in Rome, together with the movement\r\nof liberty, this affluence of all the important men towards Rome\r\ndecreased. Such a decrease was advantageous to the rising\r\ndespotism, and met with no opposition.\r\n\r\n{185}\r\n\r\n         Progress Of Public Indifference.\r\n\r\nHere, as in every instance, the necessary consequences of general\r\nfacts are revealed in particular and positive facts, up to that\r\ntime, no political act could be performed, and no suffrage be\r\nexercised, elsewhere than within the walls of Rome. Suetonius\r\ninforms us that Augustus conferred upon the citizens of a large\r\nnumber of Italian _municipia_ the right of giving their\r\nvotes without leaving their town, and sending them to Rome in a\r\nsealed packet, that they might be properly scrutinized in the\r\n_comitia_. Thus was exhibited, at once, the progress of\r\npublic indifference, and the growth of absolute power.\r\n\r\nThis progress continued rapidly. Ere long, the _comitia_ met\r\nwith the fate of all shams, and were abolished; all free\r\nintervention of the citizens in the government disappeared, and\r\nno political acts remained to be performed, either at Rome, or at\r\na distance therefrom; and as it is always a trick of nascent\r\ndespotism to offer to all men the deceptive advantages of a\r\nshameful equality, the right of Roman citizenship was, almost at\r\nthe same period, bestowed indiscriminately upon the whole Roman\r\nworld. This right no longer possessed any political significance,\r\nnor did it confer any real importance upon those who received it;\r\nand yet this concession deprived those whom it levelled to the\r\ncondition of the multitude, of any importance they might still\r\nhave retained. There is reason to believe that this measure was\r\nrather the consequence of a financial speculation than of a\r\nclever despotic combination. But despotism, even when its conduct\r\nis least guided by scientific principles, is never deceived by\r\nits instincts. Such was, moreover, the natural course of things;\r\nand degraded peoples must inevitably suffer their fate. All the\r\nblame must not be laid on the master of the flock; and the hatred\r\nwhich tyranny merits cannot save from our contempt nations that\r\nare incapable of liberty.\r\n\r\nHowever, as the degradation and ruin of an empire cannot be\r\neffected in a moment, or by a single blow; as there still existed\r\nin the Roman world some habits of liberty which despotism had not\r\nhad time or need to destroy, it was necessary to make some sort\r\nof compensation for this complete disappearance of political\r\nrights and life; and this compensation naturally resulted from\r\nthe change which had occurred.\r\n\r\n{186}\r\n\r\n         Growing Importance Of The Municipia.\r\n\r\nA portion of the importance which Rome had lost, had returned to\r\nthe _municipia_. A large number of wealthy citizens no\r\nlonger left their homes. Having been excluded from the government\r\nof the State, their attention spontaneously turned to the affairs\r\nof their own city. Nothing had yet stimulated the central power\r\nto interfere in their administration. The treasures of Rome, and\r\nthe ordinary contributions of the provinces, were sufficient for\r\nthe imperial wants, and even for its follies. Tyranny then felt\r\nbut slightly the necessity of penetrating into every quarter, and\r\nof possessing a detailed organization; and did not even know how\r\nto set about it. The municipal system, therefore, retained\r\nconsiderable importance; it even constituted itself with greater\r\nregularity, and according to more positive, perhaps more\r\nextensive rights, than those which it had previously possessed.\r\n\r\nIt is during the period from the reign of Nerva to that of\r\nDiocletian, that the state of the _municipia_ appears under\r\nthis new aspect. A great many laws were passed to increase and\r\nsecure the property and revenues of towns. Trajan permitted them\r\nto receive inheritances by way of _fidei commissus;_ and,\r\nere long, they were authorized to receive them directly. Hadrian\r\ngranted them the right of receiving legacies, and ordained that\r\nany administrator who should misappropriate the property of a\r\ntown should be considered guilty, not of simple theft, but of\r\nembezzlement. The ordinary income usually sufficed to meet the\r\nexpenditure, and it was not necessary to lay fresh taxes upon the\r\ncitizens. The State did not cast upon the cities any burdens\r\nwhich did not directly concern them; and there were but very few\r\ncitizens exempt from that which was onerous in municipal duties.\r\nThe common people bore their part, by hard labour, in the public\r\nworks which interested each town: the dignity of the decurions\r\nwas recognised and sanctioned. Hadrian freed them from the\r\npunishment of death, except in cases of parricide. The\r\ndecurionate was still sought after as an honour; and lastly, the\r\nbest proof of the importance and extension of the municipal\r\nsystem, during this period, will be found in the number of laws\r\npassed in relation to it, and the particular attention paid to it\r\nby jurisconsults. Evidently, in the absence of political rights\r\nand guarantees, the municipal system was the depository in which\r\nall the rights and securities of citizens were contained.\r\n\r\n{187}\r\n\r\n         Dangers Of Roman Despotism.\r\n\r\nBut the attempt to preserve this system could not long succeed.\r\nWe must, indeed, date revolutions from the day on which they\r\nbreak out; this is the only precise epoch which we can assign to\r\nthem, but it is not that in which they originate. The convulsions\r\nwhich we call revolutions, are far less symptomatic of what is\r\ncommencing than declaratory of what has passed away. The crisis\r\nof the municipal system under Constantine is one of many proofs\r\nof this truth.\r\n\r\nEver since the reign of Septimius Severus, the central power in\r\nthe Roman empire had been falling into ruin; its strength\r\ndecreased in proportion as its burdens and dangers augmented. It\r\nbecame indispensable to cast upon others the burdens which it\r\ncould no longer bear, and to seek new strength in order to\r\nconfront new dangers. At the same time, there arose, in the midst\r\nof the old Roman society, a society both young and ardent, united\r\nin a firm and fruitful faith, gifted from within with principles\r\nadmirably adapted to fortify its internal constitution, and also\r\nwith an immense power of external expansion; I refer to Christian\r\nsociety. It was by the action of these two causes, at first\r\ndivided and afterwards united, that the municipal system of the\r\nRoman empire was dissolved, and ended by deteriorating into a\r\nprinciple of ruin, and an instrument of oppression.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the thousand vices of despotism that its exigencies\r\nincrease in proportion as its means diminish; the weaker it\r\nbecomes, the greater is its need of exaggeration; the more it is\r\nimpoverished, the more it desires to spend. In point of strength,\r\nas of wealth, sterility and prodigality are equally imposed upon\r\nit; society, both men and things, in its hands, is but a lifeless\r\nand limited material which it expends for its own support, and\r\ninto which it is compelled to penetrate more deeply as it becomes\r\nmore exhausted, and as it is itself more nearly losing all.\r\n\r\nThe despotism of the Roman emperors existed in presence of three\r\ndangers: the Barbarians, who were continually advancing, and whom\r\nit was necessary to conquer or to bribe; the populace, which was\r\ncontinually increasing, and which it was necessary to feed,\r\namuse, and restrain; the soldiers, the force to be opposed to\r\nthis twofold peril,--a force all the more dangerous in itself, as\r\nit was necessary to increase it, and grant it daily fresh\r\nconcessions.\r\n\r\n{188}\r\n\r\n         Burdens Of The Municipia.\r\n\r\nThis position imposed immense burdens on despotism. In order to\r\nobtain resources, it was compelled to create an administrative\r\nmachine capable of carrying its action into every quarter, and\r\nwhich became itself a new burden. This system of government,\r\nwhich commenced under Diocletian and ended under Honorius, had no\r\nother object but to extend over society a network of\r\nfunctionaries, who were incessantly occupied in extracting from\r\nit wealth and strength, which they afterwards deposited in the\r\nhands of the emperors.\r\n\r\nThe revenues of the towns, like those of private individuals,\r\nwere laid under contribution by the exigencies of power, and were\r\nspeedily invaded in a still more direct manner. On various\r\noccasions, amongst others under Constantine, the emperor took\r\npossession of a large number of municipal properties; but the\r\nlocal charges which these properties were intended to meet were,\r\nnevertheless, left undiminished. Nay, more, they were increased;\r\nas the populace everywhere became more numerous and more disposed\r\nto sedition, it became more expensive to feed and amuse them, and\r\ngreater force was required to keep them in check. The central\r\npower, itself overburdened, cast a portion of its load upon the\r\ntowns. Now, whenever the regular revenues of a town did not\r\nsuffice to meet its expenditure, the _curia_, that is, the\r\nbody of wealthy citizens, the decurions, were bound to supply the\r\ndeficiency from their own private purse. They were, moreover, in\r\nalmost every place, the collectors of the public taxes, and were\r\nresponsible for this collection; their private property had to\r\nmake up for the insolvency of the tax-payers, as well as to\r\nsupply the deficiency of the communal revenues. The dignity of\r\ndecurion thus became a cause of ruin; this condition was the most\r\nonerous of all social conditions; it was, nevertheless, that of\r\nall the well-to-do inhabitants of all the _municipia_ in the\r\nempire.\r\n\r\nNor was this all; as soon as the position of the decurions became\r\nburdensome, there was a tendency to leave it, as well as an\r\nadvantage in doing so. Exemption from curial functions became a\r\nprivilege; and this privilege received an ever-increasing\r\nextension. The emperors, who disposed of all public dignities and\r\nemployments, conferred them upon the men and the classes whom\r\nthey felt it necessary to gain.\r\n{189}\r\nThus arose within the State, as a necessary result of despotism,\r\nan immense class of privileged persons. In proportion as the\r\nrevenues of the towns diminished, their burdens augmented, and\r\nfell upon the decurions, now fewer in number in consequence of\r\nthe concession of privilege. It was, however, needful to leave\r\nenough to bear the burdens imposed on the _curiæ_. Hence the\r\norigin of that long series of laws which make of each\r\n_curia_ a prison-house in which the decurions were\r\nhereditarily confined; which deprived them, in a multitude of\r\ncases, of the free disposal of their property, or even disposed\r\nof it without their consent for the benefit of the _curia_;\r\nwhich pursued them into the country, into the army, wherever they\r\nattempted to take refuge, in order to restore them to the\r\n_curiæ_, from whence they desired to escape: laws, in fine,\r\nwhich bound an immense class of citizens, in property as well as\r\nin person, to the most onerous and ungrateful of public services,\r\njust as you would compel animals to perform this or that species\r\nof domestic labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Growth Of Christianity.\r\n\r\nSuch was the place which despotism finally assigned to the\r\nmunicipal system; such was the condition to which municipal\r\nproprietors were reduced by the laws. And whilst despotism was\r\nstraining every nerve to tighten the bonds of the municipal\r\nsystem, and to compel the inhabitants to perform, as charges,\r\nfunctions which had formerly been considered as rights, the\r\nsecond cause to which I have alluded, Christianity, was labouring\r\nto dissolve or dismantle municipal society, in order to\r\nsubstitute another in its place.\r\n\r\nDuring nearly three centuries, Christian society had been\r\nsilently forming in the midst, and, so to speak, beneath the\r\nsurface of the civil society of the Romans. It was at a very\r\nearly period a regularly-constituted society, with its chiefs,\r\nits laws, its expenditure, and its income. Its organization,\r\noriginally entirely free and founded upon purely moral ties, was\r\nby no means deficient in strength. It was at that time the only\r\nassociation which could procure for its members the joys of the\r\ninner life--which possessed, in the ideas and sentiments that\r\nformed its basis, matter to occupy lofty minds, to exercise\r\nactive imaginations, and to satisfy the requirements of that\r\nmoral and intellectual existence which neither oppression nor\r\nmisfortune can completely extinguish throughout a nation.\r\n\r\n{190}\r\n\r\n         Effects Of Christianity.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitant of a _municipium_, when he became a\r\nChristian, ceased to belong to his town, and entered into the\r\nChristian society, of which the bishop was chief. There alone,\r\nhenceforward, was the centre of his thoughts and affections, and\r\nthe abode of his masters and brethren. To the necessities of this\r\nnew association were devoted, if needful, his fortune and his\r\nactivity; thither, in fine, his entire moral existence was in\r\nsome measure transported.\r\n\r\nWhen such a displacement has occurred in the moral order of\r\nthings, it speedily becomes consummated in the material order\r\nalso. The conversion of Constantine, in fact, declared the\r\ntriumph of Christian society, and accelerated its progress.\r\nThenceforward, power, jurisdiction, and wealth poured in upon the\r\nchurches and bishops, as upon the only centres around which men\r\nwere spontaneously disposed to group themselves, and which could\r\nexercise the virtue of attraction upon all the forces of society.\r\nIt was no longer to his town, but to his church that the citizen\r\ndesired to bequeath his property. It was no longer by the\r\nconstruction of circuses and aqueducts, but by the erection of\r\nChristian temples, that the rich man endeavoured to rest his\r\nclaim to public affection. The parish took the place of the\r\n_municipium;_ the central power itself, hurried on by the\r\ncourse of the events with which it had become associated, used\r\nall its efforts to swell the stream. The emperors deprived the\r\ncommunes of a portion of their property, and gave it to the\r\nchurches; they deprived the municipal magistrates of a portion of\r\ntheir authority, and gave it to the bishops. When the victory had\r\nbeen thus avowed, interest combined with faith to increase the\r\nsociety of the conquerors. The clergy were exempted from the\r\nburden of municipal functions; and it became necessary to pass\r\nlaws to prevent all the decurions from making themselves clerks.\r\nWithout these laws, municipal society would have been entirely\r\ndissolved; its existence was protracted that it might continue to\r\nbear the burden to which it was condemned; and, strange to say,\r\nthe emperors most favourable to the ecclesiastical order, and\r\nmost liberal in augmenting its advantages, were compelled at the\r\nsame time to struggle against the tendency which induced men to\r\nleave every other association, in order to enter into the only\r\none in which they could find honour and protection.\r\n\r\n{191}\r\n\r\n         Decay Of The Municipia.\r\n\r\nSuch then, was, in truth, the state of things. Despotism, urged\r\nby its own necessities, incessantly aggravated the condition of\r\nthe _curia_. That of the church flourished and improved as\r\nincessantly, either by the aid of the peoples, or by the action\r\nof despotism itself, which had need of the support of the clergy.\r\nIt was therefore necessary continually to relegate to the\r\n_curia_ the decurions who were ever anxious to leave it. In\r\nproportion as their number decreased, and as those who remained\r\nbecame ruined and unable to bear the burden, their condition\r\nbecame less and less endurable. Thus, evil sprang from evil;\r\noppression rendered ruin certain by its efforts to delay it; and\r\nthe municipal system which, as I have said, had become an actual\r\ngaol to one class of citizens, daily hastened onwards to its own\r\ndestruction, and to that of the class which was chained to its\r\ndestiny.\r\n\r\nSuch was, with regard to the _municipia_, the course of\r\nevents and laws from the reign of Constantine until the fall of\r\nthe Western Empire. In vain did some emperors strive to raise the\r\ncommunes; in vain did Julian restore to them a portion of the\r\nproperty which they had previously lost. These changes in\r\nlegislation were ineffectual; a fatal necessity weighed upon the\r\n_municipia_; and whenever the municipal system bordered\r\nclosely upon dissolution, and it was felt necessary to support\r\nit, no other aid was given than by redoubling the energy of the\r\ncauses which urged it to destruction. Thus violent is the course\r\nof decaying despotism. The municipalities were daily sacrificed\r\nin greater measure to the empire, and the decurions to the\r\nmunicipalities; the external forms of liberty still existed\r\nwithin the _curiæ_, as regarded the election of magistrates\r\nand the administration of the affairs of the city; but these\r\nforms were vain, for the citizens who were called upon to give\r\nthem life by their actions, were stricken to death in their\r\npersonal independence and in their fortune. It was in this state\r\nof material ruin and moral annihilation that the Barbarians, when\r\nthey established themselves in the Roman territory, found the\r\ntowns, their magistrates, and their inhabitants.\r\n\r\n{192}\r\n         Abolition Of The Municipal System.\r\n\r\nIn the East, the agony of the _municipia_ was prolonged with\r\nthe duration of the empire. Here also some emperors made\r\nunsuccessful attempts to restore them to prosperity. At length,\r\nthe progress of the central despotism became so great, and the\r\nforms of municipal liberty so evidently a dead letter, that,\r\ntowards the end of the ninth century, the Emperor Leo, called the\r\nPhilosopher, abolished the whole municipal system at once, by the\r\nfollowing decree:--\r\n\r\n  \"As, in things which serve for use in common life, we esteem\r\n  those which are convenient and useful, and despise those which\r\n  are of no utility, so we ought to act in reference to laws;\r\n  those which are of some advantage, and which confer some\r\n  benefit on the commonwealth, should be maintained and honoured;\r\n  but as for those whose maintenance is troublesome and\r\n  unimportant, not only should we pay no attention to them, but\r\n  we should reject them from the body of the laws. Now, we say,\r\n  that among the ancient laws passed in reference to _curiæ_\r\n  and _decuriones_, there are some which impose intolerable\r\n  burdens on the decurions, and confer on the _curiæ_ the\r\n  right of appointing certain magistrates, and of governing\r\n  cities by their own authority. Now that civil affairs have\r\n  assumed another form, and that all things depend solely upon\r\n  the care and administration of the imperial majesty, these laws\r\n  wander, in some sort, vainly and without object around the\r\n  legal territory; we therefore abolish them by the present\r\n  decree.\" [Footnote 15]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 15:  Novell. Leo. 46.]\r\n\r\nSuch were, during the period of twelve centuries which elapsed\r\nbetween the treaty of Rome with Cœre and the reign of Leo the\r\nPhilosopher, the great revolutions of the municipal system in the\r\nRoman world. We may characterize them by saying that, during the\r\nfirst period, the municipal system was a liberty granted, in\r\nfact, to the inhabitants of the towns; during the second, it was\r\na right legally constituted, as an indemnity for the loss of\r\npolitical privileges; and, during the third, it was a burden\r\nimposed upon a certain class of citizens.\r\n\r\nI now terminate its history. In our next lecture, we shall\r\ninvestigate the real state of the municipal system during the\r\nthird period, and its influence upon the condition of the\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n{193}\r\n\r\n              Lecture XXIII.\r\n\r\n  Of the various social conditions in the Roman Empire, before\r\n  the final invasion of the Barbarians.\r\n\r\n  The privileged classes, and curials.\r\n\r\n  Their obligations, functions, and immunities.\r\n\r\n  Attributes of the _curia_ as a body.\r\n\r\n  Of the various municipal magistracies and offices.\r\n\r\n  Of the _Defender_ in cities.\r\n\r\n  Comparison of the development of the municipal system, and its\r\n  relations to the central organization of the State in the Roman\r\n  Empire and in modern societies.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Social Conditions In The Roman Empire\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the fifth century the subjects of the\r\nEmpire were divided into three classes, forming three very\r\ndistinct social conditions:\r\n\r\n  1. The privileged classes;\r\n  2. The curials;\r\n  3. The common people. I speak only of free men.\r\n\r\nThe privileged class included:\r\n\r\n  1. The members of the Senate, and all those who were entitled\r\n  to bear the name of _clarissimi;_\r\n  2. The officers of the palace;\r\n  3. The clergy;\r\n  4. The cohortal militia, a sort of _gendarmerie_ employed\r\n  in the maintenance of the internal order of the State, and the\r\n  execution of the laws;\r\n  5. The soldiers in general, whether included in the legions, or\r\n  in the troops attached to the palace, or in the corps of\r\n  barbarian auxiliaries.\r\n\r\nThe class of curials comprehended all the citizens inhabiting\r\ntowns, whether natives or settlers therein, who possessed a\r\ncertain landed income, and did not belong, by any title, to the\r\nprivileged class. The common people were the mass of the\r\ninhabitants of the towns, whose almost absolute want of property\r\nexcluded them from a place among the curials.\r\n\r\nThe privileged members of the first class were numerous, of\r\nvarious rank, and unequally distributed among the five orders of\r\nwhich it was composed; but that which was, in fact, the most\r\nimportant and most sought after of their privileges, that which\r\nalone was more valuable than all the rest, was common to the five\r\norders which constituted this class--I mean, exemption from\r\nmunicipal functions and offices.\r\n\r\n{194}\r\n\r\nWhen we come to treat of the curials, you will learn what was the\r\nextent of these duties; but you must first understand clearly who\r\nwere exempt from them.\r\n\r\n  1. The whole army, from the lowest _cohortalis_ to the\r\n  _magister equitum peditumve;_\r\n\r\n  2. The entire body of the clergy, from the simple clerk to the\r\n  archbishop;\r\n\r\n  3. It is an easy matter to define the two foregoing classes;\r\n  but it is not so clear who were the members of the class of\r\n  senators and _clarissimi_.\r\n\r\nThe number of the senators was unlimited; the emperor appointed\r\nand dismissed them at his will, and could even raise the sons of\r\nfreedmen to this rank. All those who had filled the principal\r\nmagisterial offices in the Empire, or who had merely received\r\nfrom the prince the honorary title belonging to those\r\nmagistratures, were called _clarissimi_, and had the right,\r\nwhen occasion required, of sitting in the Senate. Thus the class\r\nof _clarissimi_ included all the functionaries of any\r\nimportance: and they were all appointed and might be dismissed by\r\nthe emperor.\r\n\r\n\r\n         The Privileged Class.\r\n\r\nThe body of privileged individuals, then, was composed:\r\n\r\n  1. Of the army;\r\n\r\n  2. Of the clergy;\r\n\r\n  3. Of all the public functionaries, whether employed at the\r\n  Court and in the palace, or in the provinces.\r\n\r\nThus despotism and privilege had made a close alliance; and, in\r\nthis alliance, privilege, which depended almost absolutely on\r\ndespotism, possessed neither liberty nor dignity, except perhaps\r\nin the body of the clergy.\r\n\r\nThis privilege, and especially exemption from curial functions,\r\nwas not purely personal, but also hereditary. It was so, in the\r\ncase of military men, on condition that the children also should\r\nembrace the profession of arms; and in the case of civilians, it\r\nwas continued to those children who were born since their fathers\r\nhad belonged to the class of _clarissimi_, or had occupied\r\nposts in the palace. Among the classes exempt from curial\r\nfunctions was the cohortal militia, a subaltern service to which\r\nthose who entered it were hereditarily bound, and from which\r\nthere was no means of passing into a superior class.\r\n\r\nThe class of curials comprehended all the inhabitants of the\r\ntowns, whether natives thereof, _municipes_, or settlers\r\ntherein, _incolæ_, who possessed a landed property of more\r\nthan twenty-five acres, _jugera_, and did not belong to any\r\nprivileged class. Members of the curial class became so either by\r\norigin, or by appointment.\r\n{195}\r\nEvery child of a curial was a curial also, and liable to all the\r\ncharges attached to that quality. Every inhabitant who, by trade\r\nor otherwise, acquired a landed property of more than twenty-five\r\nacres, might be summoned to enter the _curia_, and could not\r\nrefuse to do so. No curial could, by a voluntary act, pass into\r\nanother condition. They were interdicted from dwelling in the\r\ncountry, entering the army, or engaging in employments which\r\nwould have liberated them from municipal functions, until they\r\nhad passed through every curial gradation, from that of a simple\r\nmember of a _curia_ to the highest civic magistracies. Then\r\nalone they might become military men, public functionaries, and\r\nsenators. The children born to them before their elevation\r\nremained curials. They were not allowed to enter the clergy\r\nexcept by granting the enjoyment of their property to any one who\r\nagreed to be a curial in their place, or by making a present of\r\ntheir possessions to the _curia_ itself. As the curials were\r\nincessantly striving to escape from their bondage, a multitude of\r\nlaws were passed directing the prosecution of those who had\r\nescaped from their original condition, and succeeded in effecting\r\ntheir entrance furtively into the army, the clergy, public\r\noffices, or the Senate; and ordaining their restoration to the\r\n_curia_ from which they had fled.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Functions And Charges Of The Curials.\r\n\r\nThe following were the functions and charges of the curials thus\r\nconfined, voluntarily or perforce, in the _curia_.\r\n\r\n  1. The administration of the affairs of the _municipium_,\r\n  with its expenditure and revenues, either by deliberating\r\n  thereon in the _curia_, or by discharging the magisterial\r\n  offices of the town. In this double position, the curials were\r\n  responsible not only for their individual management, but also\r\n  for the necessities of the town, for which they were bound to\r\n  provide out of their own resources, in case the municipal\r\n  revenues were insufficient.\r\n\r\n  2. The collection of the public taxes, also under the\r\n  responsibility of their private property in case of defaulters.\r\n  Lands which were subject to the land-tax and had been abandoned\r\n  by their possessors, were allotted to the _curia_, which\r\n  was bound to pay the tax thereon until it had found some one\r\n  willing to take them off its hands. If it could find no one,\r\n  the tax on the abandoned land was divided amongst the other\r\n  estates.\r\n\r\n{196}\r\n\r\n  3. No curial could sell the property from which he derived his\r\n  qualification, without the permission of the governor of the\r\n  province.\r\n\r\n  4. The heirs of curials, when not members of the _curia_,\r\n  and the widows or daughters of curials, who married men\r\n  belonging to other classes, were bound to give a fourth part of\r\n  their goods to the _curia_.\r\n\r\n  5. The curials who had no children could not dispose, by will,\r\n  of more than a fourth of their property: the other\r\n  three-fourths went, by right, to the curia.\r\n\r\n  6. They were not allowed to absent themselves from their\r\n  _municipium_, even for a limited time, without permission\r\n  from the judge of the province.\r\n\r\n  7. When they had withdrawn from their _curia_, and could\r\n  not be brought back, their property was confiscated to the\r\n  benefit of their _curia_.\r\n\r\n  8. The tax known by the name of _aurum coronarium_, and\r\n  which consisted in a sum to be paid to the prince, on the\r\n  occasion of certain events, was levied on the curials alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Advantages Granted To The Curials.\r\n\r\nThe only advantages granted to the curials in compensation\r\nfor these burdens were:\r\n\r\n  1. Exemption from torture, except in very serious cases.\r\n\r\n  2. Exemption from certain afflictive and dishonouring\r\n  punishments which were reserved for the populace; such as being\r\n  condemned to work in the mines, to be burned alive, and so\r\n  forth.\r\n\r\n  3. Decurions who had fallen into indigence were supported at\r\n  the expense of the _municipium_.\r\n\r\nThese were the only advantages possessed by the curials over the\r\ncommon people, who, on the other hand, enjoyed the benefit that\r\nevery career was open to them, and that, by entering the army, or\r\nengaging in public employments, they might raise themselves at\r\nonce into the privileged class.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the curials, then, both as citizens and in\r\nrelation to the State, was onerous and devoid of liberty.\r\nMunicipal administration was a burdensome service, to which the\r\ncurials were doomed, and not a right with which they were\r\ninvested. Let us now see what was the condition of the curials,\r\nnot in relation to the State, and to the other classes of\r\ncitizens, but in the _curia_ and amongst themselves. Here\r\nstill existed the forms, and even the principles, of liberty. All\r\nthe curials were members of the _curia_, and sat therein.\r\nThe ability to bear the burdens of the office entailed that of\r\nexercising its rights, and taking part in its affairs; the names\r\nof all the curials of each _municipium_ were inscribed, in\r\nan order which was determined according to their dignity, age,\r\nand other circumstances, in a book called the _album curiæ_.\r\n{197}\r\nWhen there was occasion to deliberate upon any matter, they were\r\nall convoked together by the superior magistrate of the town, the\r\n_duumvir, ædilis_ or _prætor_, and they all gave their\r\nopinions and their votes; everything was decided by the majority\r\nof votes: and no deliberation of the _curia_ was valid\r\nunless two-thirds of the curials were present.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Attributes Of The Curia.\r\n\r\nThe attributes of the curia as a body were:\r\n\r\n  1. The examination and decision of certain affairs;\r\n\r\n  2. The appointment of magistrates and municipal officers.\r\n\r\nNowhere can I find an enumeration of the affairs which fell under\r\nthe cognizance of the _curia_ as a body. Everything,\r\nhowever, indicates that most of those municipal interests which\r\nrequired more than the simple execution of the laws or of orders\r\nalready given, were discussed in the _curia_. The proper and\r\nindependent authority of the municipal magistrates appears to\r\nhave been very limited. For example, there is reason to believe\r\nthat no expense could be incurred without the authorization of\r\nthe _curia_. It fixed the time and place for holding fairs;\r\nit alone granted recompenses; and so forth.\r\n\r\nThere were even occasions on which the authorization of the\r\n_curia_ was not sufficient, and when it was necessary to\r\nhave the sanction of all the inhabitants, whether curials or not;\r\nfor example, for the sale of any property belonging to the\r\ncommune, or for the despatch of deputies to wait on the emperor\r\nin reference to any grievance or request. On the other hand, it\r\nis evident that, by the general progress of despotism, the\r\nimperial power continued daily to interfere more and more in the\r\naffairs of the _municipia_, and to limit the independence of\r\nthe _curiæ_. Thus they might not erect new buildings without\r\nthe permission of the governor of the province; the reparation of\r\nthe walls around the towns was subject to the same formality; and\r\nit was also necessary for the emancipation of slaves, and for all\r\nacts which tended to diminish the patrimony of the city. By\r\ndegrees, also, even those affairs the final decision of which had\r\npreviously belonged to the _curiæ_ fell, by way of objection\r\nor appeal, under the authority of the emperor and his delegates\r\nin the provinces. This occurred in consequence of the absolute\r\nconcentration of judicial and fiscal power in the hands of the\r\nimperial functionaries. The _curia_ and the curials were\r\nthen reduced to be nothing more than the lowest agents of the\r\nsovereign authority. There was left to them hardly anything\r\nbeyond the right of consultation and the right of complaint.\r\n\r\n{198}\r\n\r\n              Municipal Offices.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the appointment to municipal magistracies, it\r\nremained for a long time, in reality, in the hands of the\r\n_curia_, without any necessity for its confirmation by the\r\ngovernor of the province, except in exceptional cases of towns\r\nwhich it was specially intended to ill-use or punish. But even\r\nthis right soon became illusory by reason of the power given to\r\nprovincial governors to annul the appointment on the demand of\r\nthe person elected, When municipal functions had become merely\r\nburdensome, all the curials elected to discharge these offices,\r\nwho had any influence with the governor, were able, under some\r\npretext or another, to get their election annulled, and thus to\r\nescape from the load.\r\n\r\nThere were two kinds of municipal offices: the first, called\r\n_magistratus_, which conferred certain honours and a certain\r\njurisdiction; the second, called _munera_, simple\r\nemployments without jurisdiction and without any particular\r\ndignity. The _curia_ appointed to both kind of offices; only\r\nthe magistrates proposed the men whom they thought competent to\r\nfulfil the _munera_; but even these were not really\r\nappointed until they had obtained the suffrages of the\r\n_curia_.\r\n\r\nThe _magistratus_ were:\r\n\r\n  1. _Duumvir_; this was the most usual name of the chief\r\n  municipal magistrate. He was also called, in certain\r\n  localities, _quatuorvir, dictator, ædilis, prætor_. His\r\n  tenure of office was for a year; it corresponded pretty nearly\r\n  with that of our mayors; the _duumvir_ presided over the\r\n  _curia_, and directed the general administration of the\r\n  affairs of the city. He had a jurisdiction confined to matters\r\n  of small importance; he also exercised a police authority which\r\n  gave him the right of inflicting certain punishments upon\r\n  slaves, and of provisionally arresting freemen.\r\n\r\n  2. _Ædilis_; this was a magistrate generally inferior to\r\n  the _duumvir_; he had the inspection of public edifices,\r\n  of the streets, of corn, and of weights and measures. These two\r\n  magistrates, the _duumvir_ and _ædilis_, were\r\n  expected to give public festivals and games.\r\n\r\n{199}\r\n\r\n  3. _Curator reipublicæ;_ this officer, like the ædile,\r\n  exercised a certain oversight over public edifices; but his\r\n  principal business was the administration of the finances; he\r\n  farmed out the lands of the _municipium_, received the\r\n  accounts of the public works, lent and borrowed money in the\r\n  name of the city, and so forth.\r\n\r\nThe _munera_ were:\r\n\r\n  1. _Susceptor_, the collector of taxes, under the\r\n  responsibility of the curials who appointed him.\r\n\r\n  2. _Irenarchæ_, commissaries of police, whose duty it was\r\n  to seek out and prosecute offences, in the first instance.\r\n\r\n  3. _Curatores_, officers charged with various particular\r\n  municipal services; _curator frumenti, curator\r\n  calendarii_, the lender out on good sureties of the money of\r\n  the city, at his own risk and peril.\r\n\r\n  4. _Scribæ_, subaltern clerks in the two offices. To this\r\n  class belonged the _tabelliones_, who performed almost the\r\n  same functions as our notaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n         The Defenders Of Cities.\r\n\r\nIn later times, when the decay of the municipal system became\r\nevident, when the ruin of the curials and the impotence of all\r\nthe municipal magistrates to protect the inhabitants of the\r\ncities against the vexations of the imperial administration,\r\nbecame evident to despotism itself; and when despotism, suffering\r\nat length the punishment of its own deeds, felt society\r\nabandoning it on every side, it attempted, by the creation of a\r\nnew magistracy, to procure for the _municipia_ some security\r\nand some independence. A _defensor_ was given to every city;\r\nhis primitive mission was to defend the people, especially the\r\npoor, against the oppression and injustice of the imperial\r\nofficers and their agents. He soon surpassed all the other\r\nmunicipal magistrates in importance and influence. Justinian gave\r\nthe _defenders_ the right to exercise, in reference to each\r\ncity, the functions of the governor of the province during the\r\nabsence of that officer; he also granted them jurisdiction in all\r\ncases which did not involve a larger sum than 300 _aurei_.\r\nThey had even a certain amount of authority in criminal matters,\r\nand two apparitors were attached to their person; and in order to\r\ngive some guarantees of their power and independence, two means\r\nwere employed; on the one hand, they had the right of passing\r\nover the various degrees in the public administration, and of\r\ncarrying their complaints at once before the prætorian prefect;\r\nthis was done with the intention of elevating their dignity by\r\nfreeing them from the jurisdiction of the provincial authorities.\r\n{200}\r\nOn the other hand, they were elected, not by the _curia_\r\nmerely, but by the general body of the inhabitants of the\r\n_municipium_, including the bishop and all the clergy; and\r\nas the clergy then alone possessed any energy and influence, this\r\nnew institution, and consequently all that still remained of the\r\nmunicipal system, fell into its hands almost universally. This\r\nwas insufficient to restore the vigour of the _municipia_,\r\nunder the dominion of the empire; but it was enough to procure\r\nfor the clergy great legal influence in the towns after the\r\nsettlement of the Barbarians. The most important result of the\r\ninstitution of _defenders_ was to place the bishops at the\r\nhead of the municipal system, which otherwise would have\r\ndissolved of itself, through the ruin of its citizens and the\r\nnullity of its institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Destruction Of The Middle Class.\r\n\r\nSuch are the facts: they demonstrate the phenomenon which I\r\nindicated at the outset, namely, the destruction of the middle\r\nclass in the empire; it was destroyed materially by the ruin and\r\ndispersion of the curials, and morally by the denial of all\r\ninfluence to the respectable population in the affairs of the\r\nState, and eventually in those of the city. Hence it arose that,\r\nin the fifth century, there was so much uncultivated land and so\r\nmany towns almost deserted, or inhabited only by a famished and\r\nspiritless population. The system which I have just explained\r\ncontributed, much more powerfully than the devastations of the\r\nBarbarians, to produce this result.\r\n\r\nIn order rightly to apprehend the true character and consequences\r\nof these facts, we must reduce them to general ideas, and deduce\r\ntherefrom all that they contain in regard to one of the greatest\r\nproblems of social order. Let us first examine them on the\r\nrelations of the municipal system with political order, of the\r\ncity with the State. In this respect, the general fact which\r\nresults from those which I have stated, is the absolute\r\nseparation of political rights and interests from municipal\r\nrights and interests; a separation equally fatal to the political\r\nrights and interests, and to the municipal rights and interests\r\nof citizens. So long as the principal citizens possessed, at the\r\ncentre of the State, real rights and an actual influence, the\r\nmunicipal system was not wanting in guarantees of security, and\r\ncontinued to develop itself. As soon as the principal citizens\r\nlost their influence at head quarters, these guarantees\r\ndisappeared, and the decay of the municipal system was not long\r\nin manifesting itself.\r\n\r\n{201}\r\n\r\n          The Roman Empire And Modern States.\r\n\r\nLet us now compare the course of things in the Roman world, with\r\nwhat has occurred in the modern states. In the Roman world,\r\ncentralization was prompt and uninterrupted. In proportion as she\r\nconquered the world, Rome absorbed and retained within her walls\r\nthe entire political existence of both victors and vanquished.\r\nThere was nothing in common between the rights and liberties of\r\nthe citizen, and the rights and liberties of the inhabitant;\r\npolitical life and municipal life were not confounded one in the\r\nother, and were not exhibited in the same localities. In regard\r\nto politics, the Roman people had, in truth, only one head; when\r\nthat was stricken, political life ceased to exist; local\r\nliberties then found themselves unconnected by any bond, and\r\nwithout any common guarantee for their general protection.\r\n\r\nAmong modern nations, no such centralization has ever existed. On\r\nthe contrary, it has been in the towns, and by the operation of\r\nmunicipal liberties, that the mass of the inhabitants, the middle\r\nclass, has been formed, and has acquired importance in the State.\r\nBut when once in possession of this point of support, this class\r\nsoon felt itself to be in straits, and without security. The\r\nforce of circumstances made it understand that, so long as it was\r\nnot raised to the centre of the State, and constitutionally\r\nestablished there; so long as it did not possess, in political\r\nmatters, rights which should prove the development and pledge of\r\nthose which it exercised in municipal affairs--these last would\r\nbe insufficient to protect it in all its interests, and even to\r\nprotect themselves. Here is the origin of all the efforts which,\r\nfrom the thirteenth century onwards, either by States General or\r\nParliaments, or by more indirect means, were made for the purpose\r\nof raising the burghers to political life, and associating with\r\nthe rights and liberties of the inhabitant, the rights and\r\nliberties of the citizen. After three centuries of endeavour,\r\nthese efforts were unsuccessful. The municipal system was unable\r\nto give birth to a political system which should correspond with\r\nit and become its guarantee. The centralization of power was\r\neffected without any centralization of rights.\r\n{202}\r\nThenceforward the municipal system proved weak and incapable of\r\ndefending itself; it had been formed in spite of feudal\r\ndomination; it was unable to exist in presence of a central\r\nauthority, and in the midst of administrative monarchy. The towns\r\ngradually lost, obscurely and almost unresistingly, their ancient\r\nliberties. No one is ignorant that, at the moment when the French\r\nrevolution broke out, the municipal system in France was nothing\r\nmore than a vain shadow, without consistency or energy.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Results of the Comparison.\r\n\r\nThus although, in the Roman world and amongst ourselves, matters\r\nhave progressed in inverse proportion, although Rome began by the\r\ncentralization of public liberties, and modern States by\r\nmunicipal freedom, in both cases facts alike reveal to us the\r\ndouble truth that the two orders of liberties and rights are\r\nindispensable to one another, that they cannot be separated\r\nwithout mutual injury, and that the ruin of one necessarily\r\nentails the ruin of that which at first survives.\r\n\r\nA second result of no less importance is revealed to us by the\r\nsame facts. The separation of the municipal from the political\r\nsystem led, in the Roman empire, to the legal classification of\r\nsociety and to the introduction of privilege. In modern States,\r\nan analogous classification and the presence of aristocratic\r\nprivileges prevented the municipal system from raising itself to\r\npolitical influence, and from producing the rights of the citizen\r\nfrom the local rights of the inhabitant. Where, then, municipal\r\nand political life are strangers to one another, where they are\r\nnot united in the same system and bound together in such a manner\r\nas reciprocally to guarantee each other's security, we may be\r\ncertain that society either is or soon will be divided into\r\ndistinct and unchangeable classes, and that privilege either\r\nalready exists or is about to make its appearance. If the\r\nburgesses have no share in the central power, if the citizens who\r\nexercise or share in the central power do not at the same time\r\nparticipate in the rights and interest of the burgesses, if\r\npolitical and municipal existence proceed thus collaterally,\r\ninstead of being, as it were, included in each other, it is\r\nimpossible for privilege not to gain a footing, even beneath the\r\niron hand of despotism and in the midst of servitude.\r\n\r\n{203}\r\n\r\n              Principles of Liberty.\r\n\r\nIf from all this we desire to deduce a still more general\r\nconsequence, and to express it in a purely philosophical form, we\r\nshall acknowledge that, in order that right may certainly exist\r\nin any place, it must exist everywhere, that its presence at the\r\ncentre is vain unless it be present also in localities; that,\r\nwithout political liberty, there can be no solid municipal\r\nliberties, and _vice versâ_. If, however, we consider the\r\nfacts already stated in reference to the municipal system taken\r\nin itself and in its internal constitution; if in these facts we\r\nlook for principles--we shall meet with the most singular\r\namalgamation of the principles of liberty with those of\r\ndespotism; an amalgamation, perhaps unexampled, and certainly\r\ninexplicable to those who have not well understood the course of\r\ncircumstances, both in the formation and in the decline of the\r\nRoman world.\r\n\r\nThe presence of principles of liberty is evident. They were\r\nthese.\r\n\r\n  1. Every inhabitant possessing a fortune which guaranteed his\r\n  independence and intelligence, was a curial; and, as such,\r\n  called upon to take part in the administration of the affairs\r\n  of the city. Thus, the right was attached to presumed capacity,\r\n  without any privilege of birth, or any limit as to number; and\r\n  this right was not a simple right of election, but the right of\r\n  full deliberation, of immediate participation in affairs, as\r\n  far as they related to what occurred in the interior of a town,\r\n  and to interests which might be understood and discussed by all\r\n  those who were capable of raising themselves above the cares of\r\n  individual existence. The _curia_ was not a restricted and\r\n  select council, it was an assembly of all the inhabitants who\r\n  possessed the conditions of curial capacity.\r\n\r\n  2. An assembly cannot administrate--magistrates are necessary.\r\n  These were all elected by the _curia_, for a very short\r\n  time; and they answered for their administration by their\r\n  private fortune.\r\n\r\n  3. In circumstances of importance, such as changing the\r\n  condition of a city, or electing a magistrate invested with\r\n  vague and more arbitrary authority, the _curia_ itself was\r\n  not sufficient; the whole body of the inhabitants was called in\r\n  to take part in these solemn acts.\r\n\r\nWho, on beholding such rights, would not think that he saw a\r\nsmall republic, in which municipal and political life were merged\r\nin one another, and in which the most democratic rule prevailed?\r\nWho would think that a municipality thus regulated formed a part\r\nof a great empire, and depended, by narrow and necessary bonds,\r\non a remote and sovereign central power?\r\n{204}\r\nWho would not, on the contrary, expect to meet with all the\r\noutbreaks of liberty, all the agitations and cabals, and\r\nfrequently all the disorder and violence which, at all periods,\r\ncharacterize small societies thus shut up and governed within\r\ntheir own walls?\r\n\r\n\r\n           Principles Of Despotism.\r\n\r\nNothing of the kind was the case, and all these principles of\r\nliberty were lifeless. Other principles existed which struck them\r\nto death.\r\n\r\n  1. Such were the effects and exactions of the central despotism\r\n  that the quality of curial ceased to be a right confessedly\r\n  belonging to all who were capable of exercising it, and became\r\n  a burden imposed upon all who were able to bear it. On the one\r\n  hand, the government discharged itself from the care of\r\n  providing for those public services which did not affect its\r\n  own interests, and so cast the obligation on this class of\r\n  citizens; and, on the other hand, it employed them to collect\r\n  the taxes destined for its use, and made them responsible for\r\n  the payment thereof. It ruined the curials in order to pay its\r\n  own functionaries and soldiers; and it granted to its own\r\n  functionaries and soldiers all the advantages of privilege, in\r\n  order to obtain their assistance forcibly to prevent the\r\n  curials from escaping from their impending ruin. Complete\r\n  nullities as citizens, the curials lived only to be fleeced.\r\n\r\n  2. All the elective magistrates were, in fact, merely the\r\n  gratuitous agents of despotism, for whose benefit they robbed\r\n  their fellow-citizens, until they should be able, in some way\r\n  or another, to free themselves from this unpleasant obligation.\r\n\r\n  3. Their election even was valueless, for the imperial delegate\r\n  in the province could annul it, and they had the greatest\r\n  personal interest in obtaining this favour from him; in this\r\n  way also, they were at his mercy.\r\n\r\n  4. Lastly, their authority was not real, for it had no\r\n  sanction. No effective jurisdiction was allowed them; they\r\n  could do nothing that might not be annulled. Nay, more: as\r\n  despotism daily perceived more clearly their impotence or\r\n  ill-will, it daily encroached further upon the domain of their\r\n  attributes, either by its own personal action, or by its direct\r\n  delegates. The business of the _curia_ vanished\r\n  successively with its powers; and a day was not far distant\r\n  when the municipal system would be abolished at a single stroke\r\n  in the rapidly decaying empire, \"because,\" the legislator would\r\n  say, \"all these laws wander, in some sort, vaguely and\r\n  objectless about the legal territory.\"\r\n\r\n{205}\r\n\r\n              General Conclusions.\r\n\r\nThus, the municipal power, having become completely estranged\r\nfrom political and civil power, ceased to be a power itself.\r\nThus, the principles and forms of liberty, isolated remains of\r\nthe independent existence of that multitude of towns which were\r\nsuccessively added to the Roman empire, were impotent to defend\r\nthemselves against the coalition of despotism and privilege.\r\nThus, here also, we may learn what so many examples teach us;\r\nnamely, that all the appearances of liberty, all the external\r\nacts which seem to attest its presence, may exist where liberty\r\nis not, and that it does not really exist unless those who\r\npossess it exercise a real power--a power, the exercise of which\r\nis connected with that of all powers. In the social state,\r\nliberty is participation in power; this participation is its\r\ntrue, or rather its only, guarantee. Where liberties are not\r\nrights, and where rights are not powers, neither rights nor\r\nliberties exist.\r\n\r\nWe must not, therefore, be surprised either at that complete\r\ndisappearance of the nation which characterized the fall of the\r\nRoman empire, or at the influence which the clergy soon obtained\r\nin the new order of things. Both phenomena are explained by the\r\nstate of society at that period, and particularly by that state\r\nof the municipal system which I have just described. The bishop\r\nhad become, in every town, the natural chief of the inhabitants,\r\nthe true mayor. His election, and the part which the citizens\r\ntook in it, became the important business of the city. It is to\r\nthe clergy that we owe the partial preservation, in the towns, of\r\nthe Roman laws and customs, which were incorporated at a later\r\nperiod into the legislation of the State. Between the old\r\nmunicipal system of the Romans, and the civil-municipal system of\r\nthe communes of the Middle Ages, the ecclesiastical municipal\r\nsystem occurred as a transition. This transition state lasted for\r\nseveral centuries. This important fact was nowhere so clearly and\r\nstrongly developed as in the monarchy of the Visigoths in Spain.\r\n\r\n{206}\r\n\r\n              Lecture XXIV.\r\n\r\n  Sketch of the history of Spain under the Visigoths.\r\n\r\n  Condition of Spain under the Roman empire.\r\n\r\n  Settlement of the Visigoths in the south-west of Gaul.\r\n\r\n  Euric's collection of the laws of the Visigoths.\r\n\r\n  Alaric's collection of the laws of the Roman subjects.\r\n\r\n  Settlement of the Visigoths in Spain.\r\n\r\n  Conflict between the Catholics and Arians.\r\n\r\n  Political importance of the Councils of Toledo.\r\n\r\n  Principal kings of the Visigoths.\r\n\r\n  Egica collects the _Forum judicum_.\r\n\r\n  Fall of the Visigothic monarchy in Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Spain Under The Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nUnder the Roman empire, before the Barbarian invasions, Spain\r\nenjoyed considerable prosperity. The country was covered with\r\nroads, aqueducts, and public works of every description. The\r\nmunicipal government was almost independent; the principle of a\r\nlanded census was applied to the formation of the _curiæ_;\r\nand various inscriptions prove that the mass of the people\r\nfrequently took part with the Senate of the town, in the acts\r\ndone in its name. There were _conventus juridici_, or\r\nsessions held by the presidents of the provinces and their\r\nassessors in fourteen towns of Spain; and _conventus\r\nprovinciales_, or ordinary annual assemblies of the deputies\r\nof the towns, for the purpose of treating of the affairs of the\r\nprovince, and sending deputies to the emperor with their\r\ncomplaints and petitions.\r\n\r\nAll these institutions fell into decay at the end of the fourth\r\ncentury. The imperial despotism, by devolving all its exactions\r\nupon the municipal magistrates, had rendered these offices\r\nonerous to those who filled them, and odious to the people. On\r\nthe other hand, since the emperor had made himself the centre of\r\nall, the provincial assemblies were useless except as\r\nintermediaries between the cities and the emperor; when the\r\nmunicipal organization had become enervated, and the emperor had\r\nalmost entirely disappeared, these assemblies were found to be\r\ninconsistent and powerless in themselves. The sources whence they\r\nemanated, and the centre at which they terminated, were devoid of\r\nstrength, and perished.\r\n\r\n{207}\r\n\r\n         Barbarian Invasions Of Spain.\r\n\r\nSuch was the condition of Spain when, in 409, the Vandals, Alans,\r\nand Suevi crossed the Pyrenees. The Vandals remained in Galicia\r\nand Andalusia until 429, at which period they passed into Africa;\r\nthe Alans, after having dwelt for a time in Lusitania and the\r\nprovince of Carthagena, emigrated into Africa with the Vandals.\r\nThe Suevi founded a kingdom in Galicia, which existed as a\r\ndistinct State until 585, when Leovigild, king of the Visigoths,\r\nreduced it under his sway. Finally Ataulphus, at the head of the\r\nVisigoths, entered Southern Gaul, acting sometimes as an ally,\r\nand sometimes as an enemy of the empire. He was assassinated at\r\nBarcelona, in the year 415.\r\n\r\nI shall now pass in rapid review the principal events which mark\r\nthe history of the Visigoths in Spain, subsequently to the death\r\nof Ataulphus.\r\n\r\n  1. Wallia, king of the Visigoths, from 415 to 419, made peace\r\n  with the Emperor Honorius, on condition of making war against\r\n  the other Barbarians in Spain. He was furnished with supplies,\r\n  and authorized to establish himself in Aquitaine. He fixed his\r\n  residence at Toulouse, and waged war against the Alans and\r\n  Vandals. The Romans regained possession of a part of Spain;\r\n  Wallia's Goths, mingled with the Alans, settled in the province\r\n  of Tarragona. Catalonia (_Cataulania, Goth-Alani_) derives\r\n  its name from this commingling of the two nations. The\r\n  settlement of the Goths in Gaul lay between the Loire, the\r\n  Ocean, and the Garonne, and comprehended the districts of\r\n  Bordeaux, Agen, Perigueux, Saintes, Poitiers, and Toulouse.\r\n\r\n  2. Theodoric I. (419 451.) Under this monarch, the Visigoths\r\n  extended their dominion in the south-east of Gaul. Their\r\n  principal wars were with the Roman empire, which, after having\r\n  made use of the Goths against the Vandals and Suevi, was now\r\n  using the Huns against the Goths. In 425, occurred the siege of\r\n  Arles by Theodoric; in 436, the siege of Narbonne. There was a\r\n  disposition among the inhabitants of the country to range\r\n  themselves under the dominion of the Goths, who were able to\r\n  defend them against the other Barbarians, and to renounce their\r\n  allegiance to Rome, which was bringing other Barbarians to\r\n  subdue the Goths. About 449, the kingdom of the Visigoths\r\n  extended as far as the Rhone. Theodoric made several\r\n  expeditions into Spain; generally as the price of peace with\r\n  the Romans. In 451, Theodoric was killed at a battle fought\r\n  against Attila, either at Chalons-sur-Marne, or Mery-sur-Seine.\r\n\r\n{208}\r\n\r\n         Visigothic Monarchy In Gaul.\r\n\r\n  3. Thorismund (451-453). A victory was gained over Attila, who\r\n  had attacked the Alans settled on the Loire and in the\r\n  neighbourhood of Orleans. It was evidently the Visigoths who\r\n  drove the Huns out of Gaul. Thorismund was assassinated.\r\n\r\n  4. Theodoric II. (453-466). Avitus, _Magister militiæ_ in\r\n  the south of Roman Gaul, travelled to Toulouse to treat of\r\n  peace with Theodoric, and was made emperor by the aid of the\r\n  Visigoths. In concert with the Romans, Theodoric II. made an\r\n  expedition into Spain against the Suevi. Rechiar, king of the\r\n  Suevi, was defeated on the 5th of October, 450, near Astorga.\r\n  This was rather an expedition than a conquest on the part of\r\n  the Visigoths. Theodoric II., a curious portrait of whom has\r\n  been left us by Sidonius Apollinarius, was assassinated in 462;\r\n  he had acquired the district of Narbonne.\r\n\r\n  5. Euric (466-484). This reign was the culminating point of the\r\n  Visigothic monarchy in Gaul. Euric led expeditions beyond the\r\n  Loire against the Armoricans; in 474, he conquered Auvergne,\r\n  which was then ceded to him by treaty; he had already conquered\r\n  Arles and Marseilles, so that the monarchy of the Visigoths\r\n  then extended from the Pyrenees to the Loire, and from the\r\n  Ocean to the Alps, thus adjoining the monarchies of the\r\n  Burgundians and Ostrogoths. Euric had also extended his\r\n  dominions into Spain, where he possessed the Tarragonese\r\n  district and Bœtica, which he had conquered from the Suevi.\r\n  Euric had the laws and customs of the Goths written in a book.\r\n  A passage of Sidonius Apollinarius which speaks of\r\n  _Theodoricianæ leges_, has led to the belief that\r\n  Theodoric commenced this collection; but Euric is also called\r\n  Theodoric.\r\n\r\n  6. Alaric II. (484-507.) This reign was the epoch of the decay\r\n  of the Visigothic monarchy in Gaul. Alaric, less warlike than\r\n  his predecessors, gave himself up to the pursuit of pleasure.\r\n  He was defeated by Clovis, at Vouillé near Poitiers, and left\r\n  dead on the field. The Franks in the east, and the Burgundians\r\n  in the west, dismembered the Visigothic monarchy, which thus\r\n  became reduced to Languedoc, properly so called, and a few\r\n  districts adjacent to the Pyrenees.\r\n\r\n{209}\r\n              The Breviarium Aniani.\r\n\r\n  Alaric did for his Roman subjects what Euric had done for the\r\n  Goths. He collected and revised the Roman laws, and formed them\r\n  into a code called the _Codex Alaricianus_. This code was\r\n  based upon the _Codex Theodosianus_ published in 438 by\r\n  Theodosius the Younger, and upon the _Codex Gregorianus_,\r\n  the _Codex Hermogenianus_, the _Pauli Sententiæ_, and\r\n  the _Constitutiones Imperiales_, published subsequently to\r\n  the reign of Theodosius. This code was also called the\r\n  _Breviarium Aniani_. It has been thought that Anianus, the\r\n  referendary of Alaric, was its principal editor; but Père Sirmond\r\n  has proved that Anianus only published it by order of the king,\r\n  and sent authentic copies of it into the provinces. By an act\r\n  of Alaric, the Roman legislation was, so to speak, revived,\r\n  rearranged, and adapted to the monarchy of the Goths. It\r\n  thenceforth emanated from the Gothic king himself. In the north\r\n  of Gaul, whilst the Barbarian laws ceased to be customs and\r\n  became written laws, the Roman laws lost their force as a\r\n  whole, and became customs; in the south, on the other hand,\r\n  they remained written laws, and retained much greater power,\r\n  exercising an important influence upon the laws of the\r\n  Barbarians. It would appear that this twofold written\r\n  legislation must tend necessarily to maintain the separation of\r\n  the two nations; but it contributed on the contrary to bring it\r\n  to an end.\r\n\r\n  7. After the death of Alaric II., his legitimate son Amalaric,\r\n  still a child, was taken into Spain. His natural son, Gesalic,\r\n  became a king in Gaul. At this period, the monarchy of the\r\n  Visigoths was transferred from Gaul into Spain. The Franks,\r\n  Burgundians, and Ostrogoths, seized the Gallic possessions of\r\n  the Visigoths. Gesalic was defeated, and Amalaric reigned under\r\n  the protection of his grandfather Theodoric, and the tutelage\r\n  of Theudes.\r\n\r\n  8. On the death of Amalaric, Theudes was elected king, and\r\n  reigned from 531 to 548. He fixed the seat of the Visigothic\r\n  monarchy in Spain. He waged long wars against the Franks, and,\r\n  though an Arian, behaved with tolerance towards the Catholics.\r\n  He authorized the bishops to meet annually in council at\r\n  Toledo. Until the reign of Theudes, the principle of hereditary\r\n  succession to the throne appears to have prevailed among the\r\n  Visigoths; after Theudes, the principle of election prevailed\r\n  in fact and in law.\r\n\r\n{210}\r\n\r\n  9. From 548 to 567, reigned Theudegisil, Agila, Athanagild.\r\n  There were continual wars between the Franks, the Suevi, and\r\n  the Romans. To obtain the assistance of the Romans in his\r\n  rebellion against Agila, Athanagild gave up to the Emperor\r\n  Justinian several places between Valentia and Cadiz. Roman\r\n  garrisons were accordingly sent into those towns. The Romans\r\n  had also retained possession of other towns in Spain.\r\n  Athanagild took up his residence at Toledo. He was the father\r\n  of Queen Brunehault. At his death, the grandees remained five\r\n  months without electing his successor. At length they elected\r\n  Liuva, the governor of Narbonne, who associated his brother\r\n  Leovigild with him on the throne. Leovigild governed Spain, and\r\n  Liuva, Visigothic Gaul. Liuva died in 570, and Leovigild became\r\n  sole king. With him commences, to speak truly, the complete and\r\n  regular monarchy of the Visigoths in Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Reign Of Leovigild.\r\n\r\n  10. Leovigild, from 570 to 586, consolidated and extended the\r\n  monarchy. He gained great victories over the Greco-Romans who\r\n  had recovered a part of Spain, and won from them\r\n  Medina-Sidonia, Cordova, and other towns. He also defeated the\r\n  Vascons [Footnote 16] who had maintained their independent\r\n  occupation of the country on both sides of the Pyrenees. In\r\n  586, he completely subdued the Suevi; he greatly extended the\r\n  royal power, made large confiscations of the property of the\r\n  church and the nobles, persecuted the Catholics, and convoked a\r\n  council of Arian bishops at Toledo, in 582, to endeavour to\r\n  explain Arianism in such a manner as to satisfy the people, and\r\n  to insure its general reception in his dominions. A civil war\r\n  broke out between Leovigild and his son Hermenegild, who was a\r\n  Catholic. After various vicissitudes, Hermenegild was taken,\r\n  confined at Seville in a tower which bears his name, and put to\r\n  death in 684. Before his insurrection, he was associated with\r\n  his father in the crown, as was also his brother Recared, who\r\n  governed the provinces in Gaul. Leovigild corrected and\r\n  completed the laws of Euric.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 16: Probably the Basques of the present day. ]\r\n\r\n{211}\r\n\r\n  Up to this period, there was no unity in the Visigothic\r\n  monarchy. General institutions were wanting. The national\r\n  assemblies were more irregular than in other countries. Neither\r\n  the principle of hereditary succession, nor that of election,\r\n  prevailed as regarded the kingly office. Out of fourteen kings,\r\n  six had been assassinated. There was no coherence among the\r\n  provinces of the kingdom. The clergy were deeply divided\r\n  amongst themselves. The king gave a factitious preponderance to\r\n  the Arian minority.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Reign Of Recared.\r\n\r\n  11. In 586, Recared I. succeeded Leovigild, declared himself a\r\n  Catholic, and convoked the third general council of Toledo, in\r\n  587. A union was effected between the royal and ecclesiastical\r\n  authority. Recared found himself in a position somewhat\r\n  analogous to that of Constantine the Great, after his\r\n  conversion to Christianity. He was energetically supported by\r\n  the Catholic clergy, whom he, in his turn, as zealously\r\n  maintained. At the third council of Toledo, the two powers made\r\n  in common the laws of which they both had need. An important\r\n  fact should be noticed in the tenure of this council. During\r\n  the first three days the ecclesiastics sat alone, and regulated\r\n  religious affairs exclusively. On the fourth day, laymen were\r\n  admitted; and affairs both civil and religious were then\r\n  treated of.\r\n\r\n  Recared made war against the Franks of Gothic Gaul, and against\r\n  the Romans in Spain. This last war was terminated by the\r\n  intervention of Pope Gregory the Great, who negotiated a treaty\r\n  between the Emperor Maurice and Recared, the latter of whom,\r\n  since 590, had sent ambassadors to the Pope. The Arian clergy\r\n  excited several rebellions against Recared.\r\n\r\n  12. In 601, Recared was succeeded by his son Liuva II., who was\r\n  assassinated in 603. Withemar, his successor, was assassinated\r\n  in 610. Gundemar was then elected, but he died in 612. Sisebut\r\n  acceded to the throne in 613, and made war against the remnant\r\n  of the Roman Empire in Spain. He reduced to a mere nullity the\r\n  possessions which the emperor had until then retained. He\r\n  imposed upon the Jews the necessity of being baptized.\r\n  Heraclius had commenced this persecution in the Eastern Empire;\r\n  and it entered as a condition into the treaty which he made\r\n  with Sisebut. The Jews, when driven from Spain, took refuge in\r\n  Gaul, where they were equally persecuted by Dagobert: so that\r\n  they knew not whither to flee for refuge. The laws of Sisebut\r\n  were issued in virtue of the king's authority alone, without\r\n  the concurrence of the councils.\r\n\r\n{212}\r\n\r\n  13. Recared, the second son of Sisebut, reigned for a few\r\n  months. He was succeeded, in 621, by Suinthila, son of Recared\r\n  I., who was elected king. Suinthila had served as a general\r\n  under Sisebut. We frequently meet with similar cases in the\r\n  history of the Visigoths; and they prove that the idea of\r\n  hereditary succession was still not firmly established.\r\n  Suinthila made a great expedition against the Basques. He drove\r\n  them to the other side of the Pyrenees, and built a fortress\r\n  which is believed to have been Fontarabia. He completely\r\n  expelled the Romans from Spain, by sowing dissension between\r\n  the two patricians who still governed the two Roman provinces,\r\n  and by granting the Roman troops who remained in the country\r\n  permission to return home.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Usurpation Of Sisenand.\r\n\r\n  14. In 631, occurred the usurpation of Sisenand by the aid of\r\n  King Dagobert, who sent an army of Franks, which penetrated as\r\n  far as Saragossa. Suinthila abdicated the throne. Sisenand\r\n  succeeded him, and reigned from 631 to 636. In 634, Sisenand's\r\n  usurpation was confirmed by the fourth council of Toledo. The\r\n  crown was declared elective by the bishops and nobles, and\r\n  ecclesiastical privileges received great extension. From 636 to\r\n  640, Chintila reigned. During his reign, the fifth and sixth\r\n  councils of Toledo passed laws regarding the elections of kings\r\n  and the condition of their families after their death, against\r\n  the Jews, and on other subjects. Chintila was succeeded by his\r\n  son Tulga, who was deposed in 642.\r\n\r\n  15. Chindasuinth reigned tyrannically from 642 to 652. Two\r\n  hundred of the principal Goths were put to death, and their\r\n  property confiscated; many of the inhabitants emigrated;\r\n  Chindasuinth convoked the seventh council of Toledo, the canons\r\n  of which against the emigrants were very rigorous. In all the\r\n  measures of his government, we may discern the influence of the\r\n  Catholic clergy, intimately connected with the king against the\r\n  Arian faction. One canon ordained that every bishop residing\r\n  near Toledo, should spend one month in every year at the court\r\n  of the king. Chindasuinth revised and completed the collection\r\n  of the laws relating to different classes of his subjects, and\r\n  entirely abolished the special employment of the Roman law in\r\n  his dominions. In 649, he associated his son Recesuinth with\r\n  him in the crown, and obtained his recognition as his\r\n  successor.\r\n\r\n{213}\r\n\r\n         Recesuinth And Divine Right.\r\n\r\n  On opening the eighth council of Toledo, Recesuinth said; \"The\r\n  Creator raised me to the throne by associating me in the\r\n  dignity of my father, and by his death the Almighty has\r\n  transmitted to me the authority which I have inherited.\" These\r\n  words are the expression of the theory of divine right.\r\n  Recesuinth directed the council to revise and complete the\r\n  collection of laws; imposed a fine of thirty pounds of gold on\r\n  any one who should appeal to any other than the national law;\r\n  permitted marriages between the Romans and Goths, which had\r\n  been until then interdicted; revoked the laws of his father\r\n  against the emigrants; and restored a portion of the\r\n  confiscated property. A law was also passed, separating the\r\n  private domain of the king from the public domain. The\r\n  preponderance of the bishops in the council is evident. The\r\n  canons are signed by seventy-three ecclesiastics, and by only\r\n  sixteen counts, dukes, or _proceres_. Recesuinth died on\r\n  the 1st September, 672.\r\n\r\n  16. Wamba, elected on the 19th September, 672, manifested great\r\n  repugnance to accept the crown. He repressed the rebels in\r\n  Gothic Gaul, and besieged Narbonne and Nismes. He also\r\n  vigorously opposed the descents of the Saracens, who were\r\n  beginning to infest the coasts of Spain, as the Normans were\r\n  infesting those of Gaul. He fortified Toledo and many other\r\n  towns. During his reign the division of the kingdom into\r\n  dioceses took place; six archbishoprics and seventy bishoprics\r\n  were established. Wamba made several laws for organizing\r\n  military service, and repressing the excesses of the clergy.\r\n\r\n  17. In 680, Wamba was deposed by the intrigues of Erwig, who\r\n  was supported by the clergy. Wamba abdicated, and withdrew to a\r\n  convent. Erwig convoked the twelfth council of Toledo, at which\r\n  Wamba's voluntary abdication was announced, and Erwig appointed\r\n  his successor. The new monarch directed the council to revise\r\n  and modify the laws of Wamba regarding military service, and\r\n  the penalties to be imposed upon delinquents. A less severe\r\n  legislation was the work of the twelfth and thirteenth councils\r\n  of Toledo.\r\n\r\n{214}\r\n\r\n              The Forum Judicum.\r\n\r\n  18. Erwig had given his daughter Cixilone in marriage to Egica,\r\n  a near relation of Wamba. In 687, Egica succeeded Erwig. He\r\n  charged the sixteenth council of Toledo to make a complete\r\n  collection of the laws of the Visigoths; and this collection,\r\n  under the name of the _Forum judicum_, or _Fuero\r\n  juzgo_, long ruled the Spanish monarchy.\r\n\r\n  19. Egica had associated with himself his son Witiza, who\r\n  succeeded him in 701. Witiza was tyrannical and dissolute. He\r\n  allowed the priests to marry, recalled the Jews, entered into\r\n  conflict with the Spanish clergy and the Pope; violently\r\n  persecuted the principal lay lords, among others Theutfred and\r\n  Favila, dukes of Cordova and Biscay, and sons of king\r\n  Chindasuinth; and fell a victim, in 710, to a conspiracy formed\r\n  against him by Roderic, son of Theutfred. Roderic, or Rodrigo,\r\n  became king of the Visigoths, and his reign was the last of\r\n  this monarchy. I shall not relate to you his wars with the\r\n  Saracens, or the celebrated adventure of Count Julian and his\r\n  daughter La Cava, who was violated by Roderic, or any of the\r\n  last scenes of this history which have now become popular\r\n  poetry. [Footnote 17] Political institutions are now the sole\r\n  subject of our study. In my next lectures, I shall tell you of\r\n  the _Forum judicum_, a very remarkable legislative work,\r\n  which deserves our serious examination and attention.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 17: For the legend of Count Julian, and other\r\n    information regarding this most interesting period of Spanish\r\n    history, see Washington Irving's \"Legends of the Conquest of\r\n    Granada and Spain,\" in Bohn's edition of his works.]\r\n\r\n{215}\r\n\r\n               Lecture XXV.\r\n\r\n  Peculiar character of the legislation of the Visigoths.\r\n\r\n  Different sorts of laws contained in the _Forum judicum_.\r\n\r\n  It was a doctrine as well as a code.\r\n\r\n  Principles of this doctrine on the origin and nature of power.\r\n\r\n  Absence of practical guarantees.\r\n\r\n  Preponderance of the clergy in the legislation of the\r\n  Visigoths.\r\n\r\n  True character of the election of the Visigothic kings.\r\n\r\n  The Visigothic legislation characterized by a spirit of\r\n  mildness and equity towards all classes of men, and especially\r\n  towards the slaves.\r\n\r\n  Philosophical and moral merits of this legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Character Of Visigothic Legislation.\r\n\r\nOf all the Barbarian codes of law, that of the Visigoths is the\r\nonly one which remained in force, or nearly so, until modern\r\ntimes. We must not expect to find in this code itself the only,\r\nor even the principal, cause of this circumstance. And yet the\r\npeculiar character of this code contributed powerfully to\r\ndetermine its particular destiny; and more than one phase in\r\nSpanish history is explained, or at least elucidated, by the\r\nspecial and distinctive character of its primitive legislation.\r\nThis character I wish to make you thoroughly understand. I cannot\r\nnow deduce therefrom all the consequences which it contains; but\r\nI think they will readily be perceived by the careful observer.\r\n\r\nThe legislation of the Visigoths was not, like that of the\r\nFranks, Lombards, and others, the law of the Barbarian\r\nconquerors. It was the general law of the kingdom, the code which\r\nruled the vanquished as well as the victors, the Spanish Romans\r\nas well as the Goths. King Euric, who reigned from 466 to 484,\r\nhad the customs of the Goths written out. Alaric II., who ruled\r\nfrom 484 to 507, collected and published in the\r\n_Breviarium-Aniani_, the Roman laws which were applicable to\r\nhis Roman subjects. Chindasuinth, who reigned from 642 to 652,\r\nordered a revision and completion of the Gothic laws, which had\r\nalready been frequently revised and augmented since the time of\r\nEuric; and completely abolished the Roman law.\r\n{216}\r\nRecesuinth, who reigned from 652 to 672, by allowing marriages\r\nbetween the Goths and Romans, endeavoured completely to\r\nassimilate the two nations: thenceforward, there existed, or at\r\nleast there ought to have existed, on the soil of Spain, one\r\nsingle nation formed by the union of the two nations, and ruled\r\nby one single code of laws, comprising the essential parts of the\r\ntwo codes. Thus, whilst the system of personal laws, or laws\r\nbased on the origin of individuals, prevailed in most of the\r\nBarbarian monarchies, the system of real laws, or laws based upon\r\nland, held sway in Spain. The causes and consequences of this\r\nfact are of great importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Laws Of The Forum Judicum.\r\n\r\nFour different kinds of laws may be distinguished in the _Forum\r\njudicum_.\r\n\r\n  1. Laws made by the kings alone, in virtue of their own\r\n  authority, or merely with the concurrence of their privy\r\n  council, _officium palatinum_.\r\n\r\n  2. Laws made in the national councils held at Toledo, in\r\n  concert with the bishops and grandees of the realm, and with\r\n  the assent, more frequently presumed than expressed, of the\r\n  people. At the opening of the council, the king proposed, in a\r\n  book called _tomus regius_, the adoption of new laws or\r\n  the revision of old ones; the council deliberated thereupon;\r\n  and the king sanctioned and published its decisions. The\r\n  influence of the bishops was predominant.\r\n\r\n  3. Laws without either date or author's name, which seem to\r\n  have been literally copied from the various collections of laws\r\n  successively compiled by Euric, Leovigild, Recared,\r\n  Chindasuinth, and other kings.\r\n\r\n  4. Lastly, laws entitled _antiqua noviter emendata_, which\r\n  were mostly borrowed from the Roman laws, as is formally\r\n  indicated by their title in some manuscripts.\r\n\r\nThe _Forum judicum_, as we possess it at the present day, is\r\na code formed of the collection of all these laws, as finally\r\ncollected, revised, and arranged at the sixteenth council of\r\nToledo, by order of King Egica. The most ancient Castilian\r\nversion of the _Forum judicum_ appears to have been made\r\nduring the reign of Ferdinand the Saint (1230-1252).\r\n\r\n{217}\r\n         Visigothic Theory Of Law.\r\n\r\nLegislation is almost always imperative; it prescribes or\r\ninterdicts; each legal provision usually corresponds to some fact\r\nwhich it either ordains or prohibits. Rarely does it happen that\r\na law, or code of laws, are preceded by a theory on the origin\r\nand nature of power, the object and philosophic character of law,\r\nand the right and duty of the legislator. All legislations\r\nsuppose some solution or other to these primary questions, and\r\nconform thereto; but it is by a secret bond, frequently unknown\r\nto the legislator himself. The law of the Visigoths has this\r\nsingular characteristic, that its theory precedes it, and is\r\nincessantly recurrent in it--a theory formally expressed, and\r\narranged in articles. Its authors wished to do more than ordain\r\nand prohibit; they decreed principles, and converted into law\r\nphilosophical truths, or what appeared to them to be such.\r\n\r\nThis fact alone indicates that the _Forum judicum_ was the\r\nwork of the philosophers of that period; I mean, the clergy.\r\nNever did such a proceeding occur to the mind of a new people,\r\nstill less to a horde of Barbarian conquerors. Assuredly a\r\ndoctrine which thus serves as preface and commentary to a code,\r\nmerits our best attention.\r\n\r\n  \"The law,\" says the _Forum judicum_, \"is the emulator of\r\n  divinity, the messenger of justice, the mistress of life. It\r\n  regulates all conditions in the State, all ages of human life;\r\n  it is imposed on women as well as on men, on the young as well\r\n  as on the old, on the learned as well as on the ignorant, on\r\n  the inhabitants of towns as well as on those of the country; it\r\n  comes to the aid of no particular interest; but it protects and\r\n  defends the common interest of all citizens. It must be\r\n  according to the nature of things and the customs of the State,\r\n  adapted to the time and place, prescribing none but just and\r\n  equitable rules, clear and public, so as to act as a snare to\r\n  no citizen.\"\r\n\r\nIn these ideas on the nature and object of written law, the\r\nfundamental idea of the theory is revealed. There is an\r\nunwritten, eternal, universal law, fully known to God alone, and\r\nwhich the human legislator seeks after. Human law is good only in\r\nso far as it is the _emulator_ and _messenger_ of the\r\ndivine law. The source of the legitimacy of laws is, then, not to\r\nbe found on earth; and this legitimacy originates, not in the\r\nwill of him or them who make the laws, whoever they may be, but\r\nin the conformity of the laws themselves to truth, reason, and\r\njustice--which constitute the true law.\r\n\r\n{218}\r\n\r\nAll the consequences of this principle were certainly not present\r\nto the mind of the Spanish bishops, and many of the consequences\r\nwhich they deduced were very false; but the principle was there.\r\nThey deduced from it this other principle, then unknown to\r\nEurope, that the character of law is to be universal, the same\r\nfor all men, foreign to all private interests, given solely for\r\nthe common interest. On the other hand, it was the character of\r\nthe other Barbarian codes that they were conceived for the\r\nfurtherance of the private interests, either of individuals or of\r\nclasses. Thus the whole system of laws, whether good or bad,\r\nwhich issued therefrom, bore this imprint; it was a system of\r\nprivileges, _privatæ leges_. The councils of Toledo alone\r\nattempted to introduce into politics the principle of equality in\r\nthe sight of the law, which they derived from the Christian idea\r\nof equality in the sight of God. Thus, the law of the Visigoths\r\nwas, at this period, the only one that could be called _lex\r\npublica_.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Theory On The Nature Of Power.\r\n\r\nFrom this theory on the nature of law, resulted the following\r\ntheory on the nature of power.\r\n\r\n  1. No power is legitimate except in so far as it is just, as it\r\n  governs and is itself governed by the true law, the law of\r\n  justice and truth. No human will, no terrestrial force can\r\n  confer on power an external and borrowed legitimacy; the\r\n  principle of its legitimacy resides in itself and in itself\r\n  alone, in its morality and its reason.\r\n\r\n  2. All legitimate power comes from above. He who possesses and\r\n  exercises it, holds it solely by reason of his own intellectual\r\n  and moral superiority. This superiority is given to him by God\r\n  himself. He does not, therefore, receive power from the will of\r\n  those over whom he exercises it; he exercises it legitimately,\r\n  not because he has received it, but because he possesses it in\r\n  himself. He is not a delegate or a servant, but a superior, a\r\n  chief.\r\n\r\nThis two-fold consequence of the definition of law frequently\r\noccurs in the legislation of the Visigoths. \"The king is called\r\nking (_rex_) in that he governs justly (_recte_). If he\r\nacts with justice, he legitimately possesses the name of king; if\r\nhe acts with injustice, he miserably loses it. Our fathers,\r\ntherefore, said with reason: _Rex ejus eris si recta facis; si\r\nautem non facis, non eris_. The two chief virtues of royalty\r\nare justice and truth.\" \"The royal power, like the whole of the\r\npeople, is bound to respect the laws. Obeying the will of heaven,\r\nwe give, to ourselves as well as to our subjects, wise laws,\r\nwhich our own greatness and that of oar successors is bound to\r\nobey, as are also the whole population of our realm.\"\r\n\r\n{219}\r\n\r\n         Limits Of These Theories.\r\n\r\n\"God, the Creator of all things, in arranging the structure of\r\nthe human body, raised the head above, and willed that thencefrom\r\nshould issue the nerves of all the members. And he placed in the\r\nhead the torch of the eyes, that thence might be detected all\r\nthings that might be injurious. And he established therein the\r\npower of intellect, charging it to govern all the members, and\r\nwisely to regulate their action. We must therefore first regulate\r\nthat which concerns princes, watch over their safety, protect\r\ntheir life; and then ordain that which has relation to peoples,\r\nin such sort that while suitably guaranteeing the safety of\r\nkings, we may at the same time better guarantee that of the\r\npeoples.\"\r\n\r\nAfter having established that that power is alone legitimate\r\nwhich acts according to justice and truth, which obeys and\r\nprescribes the true law, and that all legitimate power comes from\r\nabove, and derives its legitimacy from itself, and not from any\r\nterrestrial will, the theory of the councils of Toledo comes to a\r\nstop. It does not regard that which is actually occurring in the\r\nworld: it forgets that, with such a definition, no one here below\r\npossesses legitimate power or can fully possess it, and that,\r\nnevertheless, society has a right to exact that actual power\r\nshould be legitimate. This theory knows and lays down the true\r\nprinciples of power; but it neglects its guarantees.\r\n\r\nHere we come to the junction-point of the two doctrines which\r\nhave ever contested, and still contest, the possession of the\r\nworld. One maintains that power comes from below; that, in its\r\norigin as well as in right, it belongs to the people, to numbers;\r\nand that those who exercise it, exercise it only as delegates, as\r\nservants. This theory misunderstands the true principles and the\r\ntrue nature of power; but it tends to constitute those guarantees\r\nwhich rightfully belong to society. Considered as a theory, it\r\nmaintains, and assumes to render legitimate, the despotism of\r\nnumbers. But as, in practice, this despotism is impossible, it\r\nsoon violates its own principle, and limits its operation to the\r\norganization of a system of guarantees, the object and result of\r\nwhich is to constrain actual power to become, in its conduct,\r\nrightful and legitimate power.\r\n{220}\r\nThe opposite theory, which is more profound and true at its\r\nstarting-point, assigns absolute power and sovereignty to that\r\nBeing alone, in whom resides all truth and justice: it refuses\r\nit, at the outset, to chiefs, as well as to peoples; it\r\nsubordinates both alike to eternal laws which they did not make,\r\nand which they are equally bound to observe. It reasonably\r\naffirms that all legitimate power comes from above, that it is\r\nderived from superior reason, not from number, and that number\r\nshould submit to reason; but soon, forgetting that it has placed\r\nsovereignty beyond the earth, and that no one here below is God,\r\nit becomes dazzled by its own lustre; it persuades itself, or\r\ntries to do so, that the power which comes from above, descends\r\nupon earth as full and absolute as it is at its source; it is\r\nindignant that limits should be affixed to its exercise, and if\r\nthere is nothing to stop its progress, it establishes, in fact, a\r\npermanent despotism, after having denied, in principle, its\r\nlegitimacy; whereas, the opposite theory, which assumes to found\r\ndespotism in principle, almost invariably ends by destroying it\r\nin fact, and by establishing only a limited power.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Consequences Of The Visigothic Theory.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, are the consequences of the theory regarding power\r\nand law, conceived by the Visigothic legislators. I do not say\r\nthe consequences which logically flow from it, when the theory is\r\nheld in all its bearings and faithfully followed out; but the\r\nactual consequences which it almost always entails, by the\r\nnatural tendency of things, and by the deviation into which they\r\nare forced by the passions of mankind.\r\n\r\n  1. The best depositaries of legitimate power, those who most\r\n  probably possess a knowledge of the true law, are the\r\n  ecclesiastics. Ministers of the divine law in the relations of\r\n  man with God, they naturally hold the same office in the\r\n  relations of man with man. It may then be presumed that,\r\n  wherever this theory prevails, the political predominance of\r\n  the clergy is already established, and will continue to\r\n  increase. The theory is at first its symptom, and becomes\r\n  afterwards its cause.\r\n\r\n  2. The political predominance of the clergy does not well\r\n  accord with the principle of hereditary monarchy. The history\r\n  of the Jews furnishes an example of this. The transmission of\r\n  actual power taking place altogether independently of the men\r\n  who are thought to possess rightful power in a higher degree\r\n  than all others, is an inconsistency. The theory will,\r\n  therefore, tend to make monarchy elective, or at least to place\r\n  every monarch, at his accession, under the necessity of\r\n  obtaining the recognition and sanction of the clergy.\r\n\r\n{221}\r\n\r\n  3. The election of the monarch, or the necessity for his\r\n  recognition, must be the only political guarantee, the only\r\n  limit affixed to the exercise of actual power. This power, once\r\n  constituted in this manner, is sovereign; for the depositaries\r\n  of true sovereignty, which emanates from God, have conferred it\r\n  upon its possessor by election. It would be absurd and impious\r\n  to seek for guarantees against its excess in powers of an\r\n  inferior order, less enlightened and less pure. Therefore,\r\n  every institution the object of which is either to divide\r\n  power, or to limit it in its exercise by opposing to it other\r\n  powers emanating from other sources, is proscribed by this\r\n  theory. Elective monarchical power is absolute. All the\r\n  inferior powers necessary for the government of society are\r\n  derived from it, and are instituted by it in its own name.\r\n\r\nThese consequences are met with in the legislation of the\r\nVisigoths to as great an extent as the necessary incoherence of\r\nhuman affairs will allow.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Political Predominance Of The Bishops.\r\n\r\nI. The political predominance of the bishops in the Visigothic\r\nmonarchy, is a fact evident throughout its history. The councils\r\nof Toledo made both the kings and the laws. The principal Gothic\r\nlaymen who attended and deliberated thereat were few in number,\r\nas is proved by the signatures to the canons of the councils. The\r\nphrases with which we sometimes meet, _cum toto populo, populo\r\nassentiente_, are mere formulas which pay a kind of homage to\r\nancient facts rather than to present and real facts.\r\nExcommunication is the legal punishment decreed against bad\r\nkings, against attempts at usurpation, insurrection, and other\r\ncrimes. The predominance of the bishops was not confined to the\r\ncouncils. The oversight of local functionaries and judges was\r\nalso intrusted to them, and they had the power of provisionally\r\noverruling any judgments of which they disapproved. The bishops\r\nand the king were the only persons who could not personally\r\ndefend their own cause, and who were bound to appear by proxy in\r\nsuch cases, lest their personal presence should influence the\r\ndecision of the judge. The personal and real privileges granted\r\nto the clergy, the facility and perpetuity accorded to donations\r\nmade to churches, everything in fact in the laws as well as in\r\nhistory, testifies that, in political matters, the bishops\r\noccupied the foremost rank, and that their predominance daily\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\n{222}\r\n\r\n         Election Of Kings.\r\n\r\nIt must not however be supposed that this predominance was\r\nunlimited, or that it was established without efforts; it was a\r\ndifficult task to subjugate a Barbarian king and people to an\r\nalmost exclusively moral power, and the code of the Visigoths\r\ncontains several enactments tending to restrain the independence\r\nof the clergy, and to keep them under obedience to the civil\r\npower. Ecclesiastics of every rank were bound, under the same\r\npenalties as laymen, to appear and defend their causes before the\r\ncivil judges. These same judges were competent to punish\r\nlicentious priests, deacons, and sub-deacons. The eleventh\r\ncouncil of Toledo ordained that bishops guilty of certain crimes\r\nshould be judged by the ordinary laws, and punished in the same\r\ncases as laymen, by the _lex talionis_. The laws of Wamba\r\ncompelled ecclesiastics as well as laymen to do military service,\r\nand other duties of a corresponding kind. In a word, that clergy\r\nwhich we behold at the head of society and constituting the\r\nnational assembly almost by themselves, was at the same time less\r\nisolated from the civil order, and less constituted as a distinct\r\nbody by jurisdiction and privilege, than it was elsewhere at the\r\nsame period. However, the coincidence of these two facts is\r\nnatural. We feel less need of separation from a society, as we\r\nbecome nearer subduing it.\r\n\r\nII. As to the election of kings, which may be regarded as the\r\nnatural consequence of the system, or simply of the theocratic\r\ntendency, it is formally laid down as a principle in the _Forum\r\njudicum_, and was the common law of the Visigothic monarchy:\r\nbut we must not mistake as to the origin and character of this\r\ninstitution; in Spain, it was much less an institution of liberty\r\nthan an institution of order, a means of preventing civil wars\r\nand the disorders attendant upon usurpations.\r\n\r\nFrom causes difficult to discover, the principle of the regular\r\nhereditariness of royalty did not prevail among the Visigoths as\r\namong the other Barbarian peoples. The throne at the death of the\r\nkings, and even during their lifetime, was the object aimed at by\r\na host of ambitious individuals, who contested for it _vi et\r\narmis_, and seized or lost it according to the powers of the\r\nclaimants and their factions.\r\n{223}\r\nIt was against this state of things, much more than with a view\r\nto establish or maintain the right of the nation to choose its\r\nown sovereign, that the election of the monarch by the bishops\r\nand grandees assembled in council at Toledo, was instituted. The\r\ntext of the law clearly lays this down. \"Henceforth the\r\nsovereigns shall be chosen for the glory of the kingdom, in such\r\nsort that, in the royal town, or in the place in which the prince\r\nshall have died, his successor shall be chosen by the consent of\r\nthe bishops, the grandees of the palace, and the people: and not\r\nat a distance by the conspiracy of a few perverse persons, or by\r\na seditious tumult of an ignorant multitude.\" Various canons of\r\nthe fifth, sixth, seventh and thirteenth councils of Toledo,\r\ninserted as laws in the _Forum judicum_, have as their only\r\nobject the repression of attempts at usurpation, and interdict\r\nall seizure of the throne by force, determine what classes of men\r\ncan never be eligible to the kingly office, and also guarantee\r\nthe lives and property of the families of the dead kings, against\r\nthe violence and avidity of their elected successors. In a word,\r\nall tends to prove that this election was intended to counteract\r\nviolent usurpation much more than to prevent regular hereditary\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Frequency Of Usurpation.\r\n\r\nHistorical facts lead us to the same result. The succession of\r\nthe Visigothic kings was a series of violent usurpations.\r\nScarcely do we meet with one or two examples of veritable\r\nelections, made freely and without any anterior constraint, in\r\nconsequence of the throne falling vacant. Almost always the\r\nelection by the council only sanctioned the usurpation; and at\r\nthe same time that we may doubt of its liberty, we see that its\r\nspecial object is to prevent the return of a great disorder.\r\nNeither is there anything to indicate that when, by reason of the\r\npreponderance of a more powerful or more popular king, the\r\nprinciple of hereditary succession was on the point of\r\nintroducing itself, the councils either attempted to oppose its\r\nentrance, or considered the act as an infraction of their\r\nfundamental law. In every circumstance, at this period, in this\r\nstate of society, and particularly in great monarchies, the want\r\nof order, of rule, of some check to restrain the irregular\r\noperation of force, was the dominant want felt by men who, like\r\nthe bishops, were much more enlightened and much more civilized\r\nthan the Barbarian conquerors; and political institutions, as\r\nwell as civil laws, were framed rather with this object than with\r\na view to the assurance of liberty.\r\n\r\n{224}\r\n\r\n    Progress Of Ecclesiastical Pretensions.\r\n\r\nSuch being its true nature, the election of the kings by the\r\ncouncils of Toledo could evidently not have rested entirely in\r\nthe hands of the clergy. Armed and ambitious Barbarians would not\r\nhave endured patiently to receive the crown at the will of\r\nbishops, nearly all of whom were Romans. Originally, the bishops\r\nexercised, in fact, no other right than that of sanctioning\r\npresent usurpation, by anathematizing similar conduct in the\r\nfuture. In proportion as their moral influence and real power\r\nbecame consolidated and extended, they attempted higher things,\r\nand appeared to aspire to the famous right of giving and taking\r\naway the crown. The _Forum judicum_ furnishes two remarkable\r\nproofs of this progress. The fourth council of Toledo, held\r\nduring the reign of Sisenand, in 671, decreed by its\r\nseventy-fifth canon, \"that when the king had died in peace, the\r\ngrandees of the realm and the bishops should elect his successor,\r\nby common consent.\" At a later period, when this canon was\r\ntransported as a law into the national code, it was amplified in\r\nthese terms: \"Let no one, therefore, in his pride, seize upon the\r\nthrone; let no pretender excite civil war among the people; let\r\nno one conspire the death of the prince; but, when the king is\r\ndead in peace, let the principal men of the whole kingdom,\r\ntogether with the bishops, _who have received power to bind and\r\nto loose, and whose blessing and unction confirm princes in their\r\nauthority_, appoint his successor by common consent and with\r\nthe approval of God.\" A similar interpolation occurs in the\r\ninsertion of a canon of the eighth council, which began: \"We, the\r\nbishops, priests, and other inferior clerks, in concert with the\r\nofficers of the palace, and the general assembly, decree,\" &c. In\r\nthe _Forum judicum_, after the word _priests_, these\r\nwords are added: \"_Who have been established by our Lord Jesus\r\nChrist, to be the directors and heralds of the people_,\" Such\r\nphrases as these clearly indicate the progress of ecclesiastical\r\npretensions, and their success. It is, however, certain as a\r\nfact, that the councils of Toledo never really disposed of the\r\ncrown, but that it was almost always taken by force; and that the\r\nelection of the kings by the grandees and bishops, though\r\nestablished as a principle by the laws, must not be considered as\r\na proof either of the complete predominance of the theocratic\r\nsystem, or of the extent of the national liberty.\r\n\r\n{225}\r\n\r\n         Duties Of The Sovereign.\r\n\r\nIII. But if, after having ascertained who possessed the right of\r\nappointment to the highest political office, and the mode in\r\nwhich this office was conferred, we endeavour to discover, from\r\nthe laws of the Visigoths, what duties were imposed on their\r\nkings, and what guarantees they gave their subjects for the\r\nperformance of those duties, the consequences which we have\r\nalready indicated, as likely to result from the theory that\r\npresided over this code, become clearly revealed. Good precepts\r\nabound, but real guarantees are wanting.\r\n\r\nTo those who read these laws, the legislator appears much better\r\naware of the duties of the sovereign, and of the rights and\r\nnecessities of the people, than were the other Barbarian\r\nlegislators; and, in fact, he was so. But if they next inquire\r\nwhere were the independent forces capable of procuring or\r\ninsuring the maintenance of these principles, and how the\r\ncitizens exercised their rights or defended their liberties, they\r\nfind absolutely nothing. The code of the Visigoths, though more\r\nenlightened, more just, more humane, and more complete than the\r\nlaws of the Franks or Lombards, left despotism at greater\r\nliberty, and almost entirely disarmed freedom. Texts in abundance\r\nmight be quoted in support of this assertion.\r\n\r\nIf, from these general principles, we descend to the details of\r\nlegislation, we shall find that the code of the Visigoths was, in\r\nthis respect also, much more provident, more complete, more wise,\r\nand more just, than any other Barbarian code. The various social\r\nrelations were much better defined therein; and their nature and\r\neffects more carefully analyzed. In civil matters, we meet with\r\nrepetitions of the Roman law at almost every step; in criminal\r\nmatters, the proportion of punishments to crimes was determined\r\naccording to moral and philosophical notions of considerable\r\njustice. We discern therein the efforts of an enlightened\r\nlegislator struggling against the violence and inconsiderateness\r\nof Barbarian manners. The title, _De cœde et morte hominum_,\r\ncompared with the corresponding laws of other peoples, is a very\r\nremarkable example of this.\r\n\r\n{226}\r\n\r\n         Principle Of Criminal Law.\r\n\r\nIn other codes the injury done seems almost alone to constitute\r\nthe crime, and the punishment is fixed in that material\r\nreparation which results from a pecuniary composition. In this\r\ncode, crime is measured by its moral and true element--intention.\r\nThe various shades of criminality, absolutely involuntary\r\nhomicide, homicide by inadvertence, homicide by provocation,\r\nhomicide with or without premeditation, are all distinguished and\r\ndefined almost as accurately as in our codes, and the punishments\r\nvary in an equitable proportion. The justice of the legislator\r\nwent further than this. He attempted, if not to abolish, at least\r\nto diminish that diversity of legal value established among men\r\nby the other Barbarian codes. The only distinction which it\r\nmaintained was that between the freeman and the slave. In regard\r\nto freemen, the punishment does not vary, either according to the\r\norigin or rank of the dead man, but simply according to the\r\ndifferent degrees of the moral culpability of the murderer. With\r\nregard to slaves, though not daring completely to deprive masters\r\nof the right of life and death, the _Forum judicum_ at least\r\nattempted to subject them to a public and regular course of\r\nprocedure:--\r\n\r\n\r\n         _Laws Regarding Slaves._\r\n\r\n\"If no one who is guilty or accomplice of a crime should remain\r\nunpunished, how much more should those be punished who have\r\ncommitted homicide wickedly and with levity. Thus, as cruel\r\nmasters, in their pride, frequently put to death their slaves\r\nwithout any fault on their part, it is fitting altogether to\r\nextirpate this license, and to ordain that the present law shall\r\nbe eternally observed by all. No master or mistress may, without\r\na public trial, put to death any of their male or female slaves,\r\nor any person dependent upon them. If a slave, or any other\r\nservant, commit a crime which may lead to his capital\r\ncondemnation, his master or accuser shall immediately give\r\ninformation thereof to the judge of the place where the action\r\nwas committed, or to the count, or to the duke. After the\r\ndiscussion of the affair, if the crime be proved, let the culprit\r\nsuffer, either by sentence of the judge, or of his master, the\r\npunishment of death which he has deserved; in such sort, however,\r\nthat if the judge will not put the culprit to death, he shall\r\ndraw up a capital sentence against him, in writing, and then it\r\nshall be in the power of the master to kill him or to keep him in\r\nlife.\r\n{227}\r\nIn truth, if the slave, by a fatal boldness, while resisting his\r\nmaster, has struck him or attempted to strike him with a weapon,\r\nor a stone, or by any other blow, and if the master in\r\nself-defence has killed the slave in his anger, the master shall\r\nin no wise suffer the punishment of homicide. But he must prove\r\nthat this was the case; and he must prove it by the testimony or\r\noath of the slaves, both male and female, who were present at the\r\ntime, and by the oath of himself, the author of the deed.\r\nWhosoever, from pure wickedness, and by his own hand or that of\r\nanother, shall have killed his slave without bringing him to\r\npublic trial, shall be branded with infamy, declared incapable of\r\ngiving evidence, and doomed to pass the rest of his life in exile\r\nand penitence; and his property shall be given to his nearest\r\nrelatives, to whom the law grants it as an inheritance.\"\r\n\r\nThis law alone, and the efforts which its passage reveals, do\r\ngreat honour to the Visigothic legislators; for nothing honours\r\nthe laws and their authors so much as a courageous moral conflict\r\nagainst the bad customs and evil prejudices of their age and\r\ncountry. We are often forced to believe that the love of power\r\nhas a great share in the construction of laws which aim at the\r\nmaintenance of order and the repression of violent passions; the\r\nexcess of passion borders closely on the rights of liberty, and\r\norder is the hackneyed pretext of despotism. But here, power has\r\nnothing to gain; the law is disinterested; it seeks after justice\r\nonly; it seeks after it laboriously, in opposition to the strong\r\nwho reject it, and for the benefit of the weak who are unable to\r\ncall in its aid--perhaps, even, in opposition to the public\r\nopinion of the time, which, after having had great difficulty in\r\nlooking on a Roman as a Goth, had still more in regarding a slave\r\nas a man. This respect for man, whatever may be his origin or\r\nsocial condition, is a phenomenon unknown to Barbarian\r\nlegislation; and nearly fourteen centuries elapsed before the\r\ndoctrine passed from religion into politics, from the Gospel into\r\nthe codes. It is therefore no slight honour to the Visigothic\r\nbishops that they did their best to guard and transfer into the\r\nlaws this noble sentiment, which it is so difficult to\r\ndisentangle from the meshes of fact, and which is continually in\r\ndanger of being crushed beneath the pressure of circumstance.\r\n\r\n{228}\r\n\r\n         Presence Of A Good Principle.\r\n\r\nIt continually recurs in their legislation, both in general\r\nprecepts and in special regulations; and when it yields, either\r\nbefore the inconsiderate brutality of Barbarian customs, or\r\nbefore the despotic traditions of Roman jurisprudence--traditions\r\nwith which the minds of the Spanish bishops themselves were\r\nimbued--we still discern, even in these bad laws, the obscure\r\npresence of a good principle labouring to surmount the obstacles\r\nbeneath which it has succumbed.\r\n\r\n{229}\r\n\r\n              Lecture XXVI.\r\n\r\n  Central institutions of the Visigothic monarchy.\r\n\r\n  True character of the Councils of Toledo.\r\n\r\n  Amount of their political influence.\r\n\r\n  The _Officium palatinum._\r\n\r\n  Prevalence of Roman maxims and institutions, among the Goths,\r\n  over Germanic traditions.\r\n\r\n  Proof of this in the local and central institutions of the\r\n  Visigoths.\r\n\r\n  Refutation of the errors of Savigny and the _Edinburgh\r\n  Review_ on this subject.\r\n\r\n  Conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Defect Of Visigothic Legislation.\r\n\r\nMy last lecture, I think, convinced you, gentlemen, that the code\r\nof the Visigoths, taken in itself, and in its intentions as\r\nexpressed by written laws, gives the idea of a better social\r\nstate, a juster and more enlightened government, a better\r\nregulated country, and, altogether, a more advanced and milder\r\nstate of civilization, than that which is revealed to us by the\r\nlaws of the other Barbarian peoples. But to this more humane and\r\nwise legislation, to the general principles dictated by superior\r\nreason, there is wanting, as I have already observed, an actual\r\nsanction, an effective guarantee. The laws are good; but the\r\npeople, for whose benefit they were enacted, have hardly any\r\nshare in their execution, and the business resulting therefrom.\r\nUp to a certain point, the code bears testimony to the wisdom and\r\ngood intentions of the legislature; but it presents no evidence\r\nof the liberty and political life of the subjects.\r\n\r\nLet us first look at the centre of the State. The single fact of\r\nthe political predominance of the bishops, the sole name of the\r\ncouncils of Toledo, indicate the decay of the old Germanic\r\ncustoms, and the disappearance of national assemblies. The\r\nAnglo-Saxons had their _Wittenagemot;_ the Lombards their\r\nassembly at Pavia, _circumstante immensâ multitudine;_ the\r\nFranks their _Champs de Mars_ and _Champs de Mai_, and\r\ntheir _placita generalia_. Doubtless, the existence of these\r\nassemblies entailed scarcely any of the consequences which we\r\nattach at the present day to the idea of such institutions; and\r\nthey certainly constituted a very slight guarantee of liberty,\r\nwhich it was then impossible to guarantee.\r\n{230}\r\nIn reality, also, they took a very small part in the government.\r\nNevertheless, the simple fact of their existence attests the\r\nprevalence of Germanic customs; arbitrary power, though exercised\r\nin fact, was not established in principle; the independence of\r\npowerful individuals struggled against the despotism of the\r\nkings; and in order to dispose of these isolated independencies,\r\nto form them into a national body, it was necessary occasionally\r\nto convoke them together in assemblies. These assemblies live in\r\nthe laws as well as in history; the clergy were received therein,\r\nbecause of their importance and superior knowledge,--but they\r\nwere merely received. Far from being their sole constituents,\r\nthey did not even form their centre.\r\n\r\nIn Spain, instead of entering into the national assembly, the\r\nclergy opened the assembly to the nation. Is it likely that the\r\nname only was changed, and that Gothic warriors came to the\r\ncouncil, as formerly to their Germanic assemblies? We have beheld\r\nthe same name applied to very different things: for example,\r\njudicial parliaments have superseded political parliaments; but\r\nwe have never seen the same thing represented under different\r\nnames, especially during the infancy of nations. When existence\r\nconsists almost solely of traditions and customs, words are the\r\nlast things to change and perish.\r\n\r\n\r\n         The Councils Of Toledo.\r\n\r\nThe councils of Toledo, then, were actually councils, and not\r\n_Champs de Mai_ or _placita_. Morally, this fact is\r\nprobable; historically, it is certain. Their acts have come down\r\nto us, and they are acts of an entirely ecclesiastical assembly,\r\nspecially occupied with the affairs of the clergy; and into which\r\nlaymen entered only occasionally, and in small numbers. The\r\nsignatures of laymen, affixed to the canons of the thirteenth\r\ncouncil, only amount to twenty-six; and in no other are they so\r\nnumerous.\r\n\r\nThese councils were not held, like the _Champs de Mars_ or\r\n_de Mai_ and the _placita generalia_ of the\r\nCarlovingians, at fixed, or at least, frequent periods. Between\r\nthe third and fourth councils, forty-four years elapsed; between\r\nthe tenth and eleventh, eighteen years. The king convoked them at\r\nhis pleasure, or as necessity required. The Visigothic code\r\nordains absolutely nothing in this respect, either on the kings,\r\nor on the members of the assembly. None of its enactments have\r\nreference, even indirectly, to a national assembly.\r\n\r\n{231}\r\n\r\n              Their Political Influence.\r\n\r\nThe nature of these councils of Toledo being thus clearly\r\ndetermined, it remains for us to inquire what influence they\r\nexerted in the government. What were they as guarantees of the\r\npublic liberties, and of the execution of the laws?\r\n\r\nBefore consulting special facts, the very nature of these\r\nassemblies may furnish us with some general indications with\r\nregard to their political influence. The clergy, taking a direct\r\nand active part in the government, were never in a natural and\r\nsimple position. I do not speak either of the ecclesiastical law,\r\nor of the special mission of the clergy, or of the separation of\r\nthe spiritual from the temporal order, which are questions still\r\ninvolved in obscurity. I examine facts alone. In fact, in the\r\nStates of modern Europe, and at their origin, as well as in later\r\ntimes, the clergy did not govern, they neither commanded armies,\r\nnor administered justice, nor collected the taxes, nor held sway\r\nover the provinces. They penetrated to a greater or less\r\ndistance, by more or less regular means, along the various paths\r\nof political life; but they never traversed them fully, freely,\r\nand thoroughly; politics never were their special and avowed\r\ncareer. In a word, the social powers, from the lowest to the\r\nhighest degree, never were, either in law, or in fact, naturally\r\nlodged in their hands. When the bishops, therefore, in council\r\nassembled, interfered in the civil government, they were called\r\nto regulate affairs which did not concern them, and to occupy\r\nthemselves about matters which did not constitute the habitual\r\nand recognised business of their position and life. This\r\nintervention, therefore, necessarily bore an equivocal and\r\nuncertain character. Great influence might have been attached\r\nthereto; but it could not possess any power of energetic and\r\neffectual resistance. If warrior chiefs meet together in assembly\r\naround their monarch, they can rely on their comrades and their\r\nsoldiers to support their resolutions; if elected deputies\r\nassemble to vote taxes and ratify the laws of the country, they\r\nare sustained by the number, credit, and opinion of those who\r\nchose and deputed them.\r\n\r\n{232}\r\n\r\n         Position Of The Visigothic Bishops.\r\n\r\nIf bodies charged with the administration of justice are, at the\r\nsame time, called to deliberate upon certain acts of the\r\nsovereign, they may, by suspending the exercise of their\r\nfunctions, place the government in an almost untenable position.\r\nIn these various combinations, a positive force, more or less\r\nregular in its character, stands at the back of the men appointed\r\nto control the supreme power. On the part of the clergy, any\r\ndecisive resistance, in political matters, is almost\r\nimpracticable, for not one of the effective forces of society is\r\nnaturally at their disposal; and, in order to gain possession of\r\nsuch a force, they must abandon their position, abjure their\r\ncharacter, and thus compromise the moral force whence they derive\r\ntheir true point of support. Thus, by the nature of things, the\r\nclergy are but ill-adapted to be constituted into a political\r\npower, with the mission of exercising control, and offering\r\nresistance. If they desire to remain within the limits of their\r\nposition, they find themselves, at the decisive moment,\r\nunprovided with effective and trusty weapons. If they seek after\r\nsuch weapons, they throw the whole of society into disturbance,\r\nand incur the legitimate reproach of usurpation. Modern history,\r\nat every step, demonstrates this two-fold truth. When the clergy\r\nhave believed themselves strong enough to resist in the same way\r\nas civil powers would have done, they have compromised themselves\r\nas clergy, and have increased disorder rather than obtained\r\nreform. When they have not made such attempts, their resistance\r\nhas almost invariably been ineffectual at the moment when it was\r\nmost necessary; and as, in such cases, ecclesiastics generally\r\nfeel conscious of their weakness, they have not opposed any solid\r\nbarrier to the encroachments of power; and, when they have not\r\nconsented to be the instruments of its will, they have yielded\r\nafter an impotent admonition.\r\n\r\nSuch was the position of the Visigothic bishops. They had not yet\r\nacquired, in temporal matters, sufficient force to struggle\r\nopenly against the crown. They felt that a great part of their\r\nimportance was due to their close alliance with the royal power,\r\nand that they would be great losers by breaking off the\r\nconnection. They could not, therefore, carry their resistance\r\nvery far, or establish in reality an independent political\r\nassembly. They went as far as to sanction the royal power, and to\r\nassociate themselves with it by becoming its advisers; but they\r\nattempted nothing beyond.\r\n\r\n{233}\r\n\r\n         Influence Of The Councils Of Toledo.\r\n\r\nFacts prove this. These councils of Toledo, whither usurpers came\r\nto be elected, and which gave an entire code to the Visigoths,\r\nexercised in fact, over the great events of this period in Spain,\r\nless influence than was exerted in France by the _Champs de\r\nMars_ and _de Mai_. They occupied, but did not supply,\r\nthe place of the old Germanic assemblies, for they did not\r\npossess their brute force, and were not in a position to\r\nsubstitute for it any sufficient regular force. Spain was\r\nindebted to them for a much better legislation than that\r\npossessed by other Barbarian nations, and probably also, in their\r\ndaily practice, for a more enlightened and humane administration\r\nof justice; but in vain do we seek to find therein the principle\r\nof a great institution of liberty, and the characteristics of a\r\nveritable resistance of absolute power. During the period which\r\nnow occupies our attention, the reigning power in the other\r\nStates founded by the Barbarians was force--disorderly,\r\ncapricious, and unsettled force, sometimes distributed amongst a\r\nmultitude of almost independent chieftains; sometimes\r\nconcentrated, for a brief space, and according to circumstances,\r\nin the hands of one man, or of a brutal and transitory\r\naristocracy. No principle was acknowledged; no right was legal;\r\nall was matter of fact, liberty as well as power; and the germs\r\nof free institutions existed in the disorderly relations of these\r\nindependent or ill-united forces, although, to speak the truth,\r\nliberty was nowhere visible. In Spain, and through the influence\r\nof the clergy, the government undoubtedly assumed greater\r\ngenerality and a more regular form; the laws afforded greater\r\nprotection to the weak; the administration paid more attention to\r\ntheir condition; and there was less disorder and violence in\r\nsociety at large. Broader and more elevated moral ideas\r\nfrequently governed the exercise of power. But, on the other\r\nhand, power was constituted under a more absolute form; Roman\r\nmaxims prevailed over Germanic traditions; theocratic doctrines\r\nlent their aid to the arbitrary power of the Barbarians. The\r\ncouncils of Toledo modified and enlightened despotism, but did\r\nnot limit the exercise of power.\r\n\r\n{234}\r\n\r\n         The Officium Palatinum.\r\n\r\nSome writers have thought they perceived, in another institution\r\nwhich existed at the centre of the Visigothic monarchy, the\r\nprinciple and instrument of a limitation of the sovereign\r\nauthority. I refer to the _officium palatinum_, a species of\r\ncouncil formed around the king, by the grandees of his Court, and\r\nthe principal functionaries of the government. The importance of\r\nthis council, and its participation in public business, are\r\nattested by a large number of laws passed either independently of\r\nthe councils of Toledo, or in virtue of their deliberation. The\r\nwords, _cum omni palatino officio, cum assensu sacerdotum\r\nmajorumque palatii, ex palatino officio_, and the like,\r\nfrequently occur in the code of the Visigoths. These texts and\r\nthe voice of history do not admit of a doubt that the _officium\r\npalatinum_ frequently interfered in the legislation, in the\r\ngovernment, and even in the elevation of kings.\r\n\r\nIt would be a mistake, however, to regard it as a political\r\ninstitution, a guarantee of liberty, a means of exercising\r\ncontrol and offering resistance. Power could not, in any case,\r\nsubsist alone, by itself and in the air; it must, of sheer\r\nnecessity, conciliate interests, appropriate forces, in a word,\r\nsurround itself with auxiliaries, and maintain its position by\r\ntheir aid. In the Roman Empire, this necessity had given birth to\r\nthe creation of the Court and of the _officium palatinum,_\r\ninstituted by Diocletian and Constantine. In the Barbarian\r\nStates, it led the kings to surround themselves with\r\n_Antrustions, Leudes_, sworn vassals, and all those natural\r\nor factitious grandees, who, becoming dispersed at a later\r\nperiod, and settling in their own domains, became the principal\r\nmembers of the feudal aristocracy. From these two sources arose\r\nthe _officium palatinum_ of the Visigothic kings, with this\r\ndifference, that, in this point as in others, Roman institutions\r\nprevailed over Barbarian customs, to the great advantage of\r\nabsolute power.\r\n\r\nThe _officium palatinum_ of the Visigoths was composed of\r\nthe grandees of the realm (_proceres_), whom the kings\r\nattached to themselves by donations of lands and offices, and of\r\nthe principal functionaries, dukes, counts, vicars, and others,\r\nwho held their functions from the kings. This court undoubtedly\r\nformed a sort of aristocracy which was frequently consulted on\r\npublic affairs, which sate in the councils, and which furnished\r\nthe king with assessors whenever he delivered judgments. The\r\nnecessity of things required that it should be so; and as\r\nnecessity always entails consequences which far exceed the wishes\r\nof those who are constrained to yield to its sway, there is also\r\nno doubt that this aristocracy, on many occasions, thwarted the\r\nkings who could not dispense with its assistance, and thus\r\nlimited their empire.\r\n\r\n{235}\r\n\r\n         Influence Of The Aristocracy.\r\n\r\nBut human nature is the same amongst barbarian nations as amongst\r\ncivilized peoples; and the coarseness of forms, the brutality of\r\npassions, and the limited range of ideas, do not prevent similar\r\npositions from leading to the same results. Now, it is in the\r\nnature of an aristocracy that is closely pent up around the\r\nprince, of a Court aristocracy, to use power for their own\r\nadvantage rather than to limit it for the benefit of the State.\r\nIt almost inevitably becomes a focus of faction and intrigue,\r\naround which individual interests are set in motion, and not a\r\ncentre of controlment and resistance in which the public interest\r\nfinds a place. If the times are barbarous and manners violent,\r\nindividual interests assume the forms of barbarism and use the\r\nmeans of violence; if satisfied, they obey with the same\r\nservility as before; if discontented, they poison, assassinate,\r\nor dethrone. Such was the case in the monarchy of the Visigoths.\r\nAll usurpations and revolutions in power originated in the\r\n_officium palatinum;_ and when a king attempted to subject\r\nthe nobles to the performance of public services, to limit or\r\neven to examine into the concessions which they demanded, that\r\nking lost the empire. Such was the fate of Wamba.\r\n\r\nThe Visigothic sovereigns had, moreover, in the bishops, a\r\npowerful counterpoise, which they set in opposition to the nobles\r\nof their Court, in order to prevent them from aspiring to entire\r\nindependence. The influence of the clergy, too weak to act as an\r\neffectual check on the power of the prince, was strong enough, in\r\nthe hands of the prince, to prevent the check from coming from\r\nany other quarter. The reign of Chindasuinth affords an example\r\nof this.\r\n\r\nFinally, as I have already said, the predominance of Roman maxims\r\nand institutions in Spain was so great, that the central\r\naristocracy bore more resemblance to the _officium\r\npalatinum_ of the emperors than to the _Antrustions_ or\r\n_Leudes_ of Germanic origin. Elsewhere, these last were not\r\nslow to obtain sufficient strength to assert their independence,\r\nto isolate themselves from the prince, and finally to become\r\npetty sovereigns in their own domains.\r\n{236}\r\nIn Spain, things did not occur precisely thus. It appears that\r\nthe _proceres_ received from the king dignities and offices\r\nin greater abundance than lands, and thus acquired less\r\nindividual and personal strength. Perhaps the equality granted to\r\nthe Roman population, and the fusion of the two peoples, did not\r\npermit so great a dilapidation of property and distribution of\r\ndomains as that which took place in France. What would have\r\noccurred if the monarchy of the Visigoths had not been\r\ninterrupted in its course by the conquest of the Arabs? Would the\r\ndismemberment of the royal power and the dispersion of the Court\r\nhave led to the dispersion and independence of the landed\r\naristocracy? We cannot say. This much is certain, that the\r\nphenomenon which was exhibited in France, at the fall of the\r\nCarlovingians, did not occur among the Visigoths, in the eight\r\ncentury: the _officium palatinum_ had neither destroyed nor\r\ndivided the royal power, and made but feeble attempts to limit\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Character Of The Goths.\r\n\r\nOne fact must be added, which, though universally attested, is\r\nnot explained in a satisfactory manner. Of the various German\r\npeoples, the Goths preserved in the smallest degree their\r\nprimitive institutions and manners. The Ostrogoths in Italy,\r\nunder Theodoric, like the Visigoths in Spain, allowed Roman\r\nhabits to prevail amongst them, and permitted their kings to\r\narrogate to themselves the plenitude of imperial power. We even\r\nfind, among the Goths of Italy, still fewer traces of the\r\nexistence of the old national assemblies, and of the\r\nparticipation of the people in the affairs of the State.\r\n\r\nIt would therefore be vain to seek, in the Visigothic monarchy,\r\nfor the principles, or even the remnants, of any great\r\ninstitution of liberty, or of any effectual limitation of power.\r\nNeither the councils of Toledo, nor the _officium palatinum_\r\npresent this character; but there resulted from them something\r\nthat did not result from the _Champs de Mars_ and _de\r\nMai_, or from the Saxon Wittenagemot,--a code of laws, which,\r\nfor that period, are very remarkable for their large\r\nphilosophical views, their foresight, and their wisdom; but this\r\ncode, though it indicates the handiwork of enlightened\r\nlegislators, nowhere reveals the existence of a free people. It\r\ncontains even fewer germs or monuments of liberty than the rudest\r\nof Barbarian laws; and the royal power, thus considered as in\r\nitself the centre of the State, appears as much more absolute in\r\nright, and much less limited in fact, than it was anywhere else.\r\nAn examination of the local institutions of the Visigoths will\r\nlead us to the same result.\r\n\r\n{237}\r\n\r\n     Local Institutions Of The Visigoths.\r\n\r\nLocal institutions are the most real, perhaps the only real,\r\ninstitutions of Barbarian peoples. They do not possess sufficient\r\nvitality or enlargement of mind to originate or preserve general\r\ninstitutions. The material contiguity of individuals is an almost\r\nindispensable condition of the existence of society amongst them;\r\nit is therefore in the local institutions of the German peoples\r\nthat we must seek the history of their political life. The forms\r\nof these institutions; and the modifications which they\r\nunderwent, exercised far greater influence over their destiny,\r\nthan the revolutions which occurred in central institutions, such\r\nas the Wittenagemot, the _placita generalia_, and the royal\r\npower.\r\n\r\nAs you have already seen, the laws of most of the German peoples\r\npresent three co-existent and conflicting systems: institutions\r\nof liberty; institutions of territorial patronage, which gave\r\nbirth to feudalism; and monarchical institutions. The assembly of\r\nfree men transacting the general business, and administering\r\njustice in every district; the landowners, exercising authority\r\nand jurisdiction throughout their domains; the king's delegates,\r\nwhether dukes, counts, or others, also possessing authority and\r\njurisdiction: such are the three powers which have reciprocally\r\ncontested the government of localities, and whose existence and\r\nvicissitudes are proved by the laws as well as by facts.\r\n\r\nThe code of the Visigoths presents no trace whatever of the first\r\nof these systems, and scarcely any of the second; the third\r\nimmensely predominates. There was no _mallum_, no\r\n_placitum_, no assemblies of free men in the provinces; no\r\nenactment ordains, or even refers to them. Scarcely does there\r\nexist any indication of the power of the patron over his client,\r\nof the landowner over the inhabitants of his domains. The law\r\nwhich I quoted in my last lecture, with reference to slaves,\r\nproves that, even in their case, the jurisdiction belonged to the\r\nroyal judge of the district.\r\n\r\n{238}\r\n              Various Kinds Of Magistrates.\r\n\r\nThe _Forum judicum_ mentions a large number of local\r\nmagistrates who were invested with the power of administering\r\naffairs and distributing justice. \"As there is a great variety in\r\nthe means of remedying evils and terminating affairs, let the\r\nduke, count, vicar, conservator of the peace (_pacis\r\nassertor_), _tinfadus, millenarius, quingentenarius,\r\ncentenarius, decanus, defensor, numerarius_, and those who are\r\nsent to any place by order of the king, and those who are\r\naccepted as judges by the agreement of the litigant parties,--\r\nlet all persons, in fine, of whatever order they may be, who are\r\nregularly invested with power to judge, and each person in such\r\nproportion as he has received power to judge, equally obtain from\r\nthe law the name of judges, in order that, having received the\r\nright to judge, the duties as well as the advantages connected\r\nwith that right may devolve upon them.\"\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to determine with precision the different\r\nfunctions of all these magistrates, the hierarchy which existed\r\namong them, and the manner in which each of them received and\r\nexercised his power. Those who belonged to towns, as the\r\n_defensor_ and the _numerarius_, were certainly elected\r\nby the clergy and inhabitants. Several others, as the\r\n_millenarius_ and _centenarius_, seem to have been\r\nappointed by the dukes and counts of the provinces; but however\r\nthis may be, nothing indicates that they received their authority\r\nin a popular and independent way; the opposite principle is\r\nformally laid down in these terms: \"No one shall be permitted to\r\njudge suits, except those who have received power from the prince\r\nto do so, or those who have been chosen as judges, by agreement\r\nof the litigants; the choice of these last shall be made in\r\npresence of three witnesses, and shall be attested by their mark\r\nor signature. If those who have received from the king power to\r\njudge, or those who exercise judicial power by commission from\r\nthe counts or other royal judges, have charged, by writing, and\r\naccording to the prescribed rules, other persons to fill their\r\nplaces, these last shall exercise, in the regulation and decision\r\nof affairs, a power similar to that of those by whom they were\r\nappointed.\" Thus, all the judges, all the local officers,\r\nreceived their power from the king or his delegates. Of the three\r\nsystems of institutions, whose co-existence and conflict are\r\nmanifested amongst most of the German peoples, the monarchical\r\nsystem is the only one with which we meet in the code of the\r\nVisigoths.\r\n\r\n{239}\r\n\r\nIn addition to the permanent judges, established in various\r\nlocalities, the kings had power to send special commissioners,\r\neither to restore order in disaffected provinces, or to give\r\njudgment in cases of particular importance. Criminal as well as\r\ncivil affairs were submitted to the decision of the royal judges.\r\nAll these judges received salaries from the king; but they also\r\nlevied such enormous fees on the litigants, that the fees\r\nfrequently amounted to one-third of the value of the object in\r\nlitigation, A law was passed, limiting them to one-twentieth. Any\r\nwho thought they had reason to complain of the decision of the\r\njudge might appeal, either to the duke or count of the province,\r\nor to the king himself. If the appeal was deemed well-founded, in\r\naddition to gaining the cause, the judge had to pay the appellant\r\na sum equal to the value of the object in litigation. If the\r\njudgment was confirmed, the appellant had to pay the same amount\r\nto the judge, and if he could not do so, he was condemned\r\npublicly to receive a hundred lashes.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Constitution Of Judicial Authority.\r\n\r\nUp to this point, nothing in the constitution of judicial\r\nauthority exhibits any of those guarantees of liberty contained\r\nin the laws of the other Barbarian peoples. Nothing discloses any\r\nremnant or even remembrance of the old forms of judgment by the\r\nassembly of free men, _per Rachimburgos, bonos homines_, &c.\r\nSome passages of the _Forum judicum_, however, prove that\r\nthe judges, at least, had assessors. The fourth council of Toledo\r\nformally prohibits the kings from administering justice alone;\r\nand several texts allude to _auditores_. Most learned men,\r\nand amongst others Heineccius, are of opinion that the assessors\r\nwere not mere councillors; and that the judge was bound to take\r\nthe opinions of a majority of them. I am inclined to think so\r\ntoo. Several texts, however, formally indicate that the judge was\r\nat liberty to take assessors or not, as he pleased.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Laws Against Bad Judges.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of those real guarantees of liberty, which\r\noriginated elsewhere in the more or less effectual intervention\r\nof the freemen in the judgment of cases, the _Forum judicum_\r\ncontains a multitude of precautions or laws against bad judges.\r\n{240}\r\nIn case of appeal to the count or king, if it were proved that\r\nthe wrong decision of the judge was occasioned by malice,\r\ncorruption, or prevarication of any kind, and if he were unable\r\nto pay the appellant the requisite sum, he was given to him as a\r\nslave, and condemned to receive besides fifty lashes in public.\r\nHe was absolved from all penalty, however, if he proved, under\r\noath, that his decision was pronounced in error or ignorance. The\r\njudges who neglected to prosecute the licentious were punished\r\nwith a hundred lashes, and fined 300 _solidi_. The priests\r\nand bishops everywhere were enjoined to exercise a strict\r\nsurveillance over the judges; and as the former then derived\r\ntheir chief strength from their superior knowledge and their\r\nprotection of the weak, it is not unlikely that this guarantee\r\nwas effective.\r\n\r\nBut all this was defective, as you perceive, by the radical\r\ndefect of the system of pure monarchy, which gives, as the only\r\nguarantee for the good conduct of the depositaries of power, the\r\nsurveillance and authority of superior depositaries placed in the\r\nsame position, and invested with the same functions.\r\n\r\n         ... Sed quis custodiet ipsos\r\n         Custodes? ...\r\n\r\nThe true guarantees of liberty can only reside in the concurrence\r\nof collateral and independent powers, none of which is absolute,\r\nand which mutually control and limit each other. Of this the\r\n_Forum judicum_ affords us no trace, at any stage in the\r\nlong hierarchy of the government.\r\n\r\nThe local government of the Visigoths, then, presents still fewer\r\ninstitutions containing any active principle of liberty, any real\r\nforce of control or resistance, than are found in their political\r\n_régime_, and at the centre of the State. Such is, at least,\r\nthe unavoidable result to which we are led by an examination of\r\nthe general and definitive code of this nation.\r\n\r\nThis result has appeared so singular, so opposed to German\r\ncustoms, and to the state of things among other peoples of the\r\nsame origin, that hardly any man of erudition has been willing to\r\nread it in the _Forum judicum_; and that those even who have\r\nfailed to find in this code any proof of the existence of free\r\ninstitutions, and almost any trace of old Barbarian institutions,\r\nhave striven to discover them elsewhere in Spain at this period.\r\n\r\n{241}\r\n         Views Of M. De Savigny.\r\n\r\nI shall say nothing of Abbé Mariana, who, in his _Teoria de las\r\nCortes_, is determined to discover, in the councils of Toledo,\r\nnot only the Spanish Cortes of the thirteenth and fourteenth\r\ncenturies, but also all the principles and guarantees of\r\nliberty--all, in fine, that constitutes a national assembly and a\r\nrepresentative government. I have already demonstrated the moral\r\nimprobability and the historic unreality of the fact. Two more\r\nlearned men than Abbé Mariana, and less inclined than he to find\r\nwhat they seek, have thought that they perceive, in the _Forum\r\njudicum_, proofs that the purely monarchical system,\r\nassociated with the theocratic system, did not prevail so\r\ncompletely among the Visigoths; and that they can discover among\r\nthem evidences of effective and extended public liberties: I\r\nrefer to M. de Savigny, in his _History of Roman Law in the\r\nMiddle Ages_, and to a writer in the _Edinburgh Review_,\r\n[Footnote 18 ] in an article on _The Gothic Laws of Spain_.\r\nI do not think that the researches of these two learned critics\r\ndestroy the general results which I have just laid before you.\r\nThey nevertheless contain many curious facts hitherto little\r\nnoticed, and which throw much light on the study of the political\r\ninstitutions of the Visigothic monarchy. I shall, therefore, make\r\nyou acquainted with them, and examine the consequences to which\r\nthey lead.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 18: Edinburgh Review, vol. xxxi., pp. 94-132.]\r\n\r\nM. de Savigny, when investigating the traces of the perpetuation\r\nof the Roman law after the fall of the Empire, expresses himself\r\nin these terms, in reference to the Visigoths: \"Upon the\r\nconstitution of this monarchy,\" he says, \"we possess sufficiently\r\ncomplete information in the _Breviarium Aniani_, who, about\r\nthe year 506, that is, nearly a century after the foundation of\r\nthe State, drew up the Roman law into a sort of code for the\r\nancient inhabitants of the country. This code consists, as is\r\nwell known, of two parts: one contains texts quoted word for word\r\nfrom the Roman law; the other an interpretation specially\r\nprepared on this occasion. With regard to the texts quoted from\r\nthe Roman law, we cannot attach great importance to them, when we\r\nspeak of the real state of things at the period of this\r\npublication; as they were drawn from sources much more ancient,\r\nexpressions and even entire phrases were necessarily retained\r\nwhich had reference to various circumstances of a social state\r\nthat had already passed away and fallen into desuetude; the\r\ninterpretation was intended to explain this disagreement.\r\n{242}\r\nBut this interpretation, drawn up _ad hoc_, is, on the other\r\nhand, very trustworthy, especially when it does not implicitly\r\nfollow either the words or the sense of the text, for then we can\r\nno longer regard it as a servile and thoughtless copy, especially\r\nin what relates to matters of public law. It is impossible to\r\nbelieve that real establishments, institutions set before the\r\neyes of all, and with which all might be acquainted, could have\r\nbeen mentioned unintentionally and described without an object.\r\nNow, in this interpretation, the Roman _præses_ has entirely\r\ndisappeared; but the municipal community, with its particular\r\njurisdiction and its decurions taking part in the administration\r\nof justice, subsists in all its integrity: it even appears to\r\npossess more individual consistency and independence than it had\r\nenjoyed under the emperors.\r\n\r\n\r\n         The Defenders Of Cities.\r\n\r\n\"The general principle of the _defensores_, of their duties\r\nand the mode of choosing them, is explained in the\r\ninterpretation, as well as in the text of the Theodosian code.\r\nAccording to the text, the governor of the province was not to be\r\nburdened with the judgment of petty offences; but it does not\r\nmention who was to judge them, whereas the interpretation\r\nexpressly names the _defensor_. According to the text, the\r\nintroduction of a civil suit might take place either before the\r\ngovernor, or before those who had the right to draw up the\r\nnecessary acts; the interpretation adds the _defensor_. ...\"\r\n\r\nM. de Savigny then quotes a number of other examples to prove the\r\nmaintenance, and even extension, of the functions of the\r\ndefenders of the cities. \"Other passages,\" he continues, \"have\r\nreference to the _curia_, the decurions, and even to the\r\ncitizens in general. The system of decurions, in general, is\r\nreceived in the _Breviarium_, with very few modifications,\r\nbut merely great abridgement. To one passage of the text which\r\ncasually mentions _adoption_, the interpretation adds, as a\r\ncommentary, that it is the choice of an individual as a child,\r\nmade in presence of the _curia_. The Visigothic\r\njurisconsult, Graius, says, that _emancipation_, which\r\nformerly took place before the president, was, at the period at\r\nwhich he wrote, performed before the _curia_.\"\r\n\r\n{243}\r\n\r\n         Importance Of The Curia.\r\n\r\n\"The text determines by whom tutors were appointed at\r\nConstantinople, namely, by the prefect of the city, ten senators,\r\nand the prætor, whose duty it was to watch over the interests of\r\nthe pupils: the interpretation substitutes in their place the\r\njudge, with the chief men of the town. The text speaks of the\r\nnecessity of a decree to authorize the alienation of the property\r\nof a minor: the interpretation adds, that this decree must be\r\nobtained from the judge or the _curia_. The text ordains\r\nthat, at Constantinople, wills should be opened by the same\r\noffice that received them: the interpretation substitutes the\r\n_curia_ in its place. According to the text, donations\r\nshould be registered either before the judge (the governor of the\r\nprovince), or before the municipal magistrate (the\r\n_duumvir_): the interpretation substitutes the _curia_\r\nfor the municipal magistrate--which does not, in reality, alter\r\nthe sense of the law, but which proves what is demonstrated by\r\nmany other passages, that the general point of view was\r\ncompletely changed; anciently the chief municipal authority, and\r\nespecially jurisdiction, was considered, according to Roman\r\nmaxims, to be a personal right of the magistrate: according to\r\nthe interpretation, it belonged less to the _defensor_\r\nhimself, than to the _curia_ taken collectively. ... Under\r\nthe emperors, the _honorati_, that is, those who had\r\noccupied high municipal dignities, had a seat of honour near the\r\ngovernor of the province when he administered justice; they were\r\nonly expected to abstain from being present when their own causes\r\nwere under consideration. The interpretation applies this to the\r\ncurials; an application which is remarkable in two respects,\r\nfirst, because it proves that the curials were held in great\r\nconsideration, and secondly, because this does not merely refer\r\nto the possession of a seat of honour by them, but to an actual\r\nparticipation in the jurisdiction of the municipal judge, that\r\nis, of the _duumvir_ or _defensor_. ... The text of the\r\ncode ordains that, out of Rome, in order to pronounce sentence on\r\na criminal accusation brought against a senator, five senators\r\nshall be chosen by lot: the interpretation makes this rule\r\ngeneral, and requires five men to be chosen from the leading\r\nmembers of the same rank as the accused person, that is,\r\ndecurions or plebeians, according to the condition of the accused\r\nperson himself. Finally, the text ordained that every judge\r\nshould receive his _domesticus_ or _cancellarius_ from\r\nthe choice of the principal persons employed in his chancery: the\r\ninterpretation retains the rule, merely substituting the\r\nburgesses of the city for the persons employed in the chancery.\"\r\n\r\n{244}\r\n\r\n         Objections To Savigny's Theory.\r\n\r\nSuch are the traces of municipal liberties which M. de Savigny\r\ndiscovers in the _Breviarium Aniani_, and which he considers\r\nas the common and permanent law of the Visigothic monarchy. They\r\nprove, in fact, not merely the maintenance, but also the\r\nextension and enfranchisement, of the rights and guarantees\r\npossessed by the inhabitants of the towns before the settlement\r\nof the Barbarians. But strong objections may be raised against\r\nthe importance which the author attaches to these texts, and the\r\nextent of the conclusions which he deduces therefrom.\r\n\r\nI. The _Breviarium Aniani_ does not contain the common and\r\npermanent law of the Spanish monarchy of the Visigoths. It only\r\ngives the special legislation of the Roman subjects of the\r\nVisigothic kings, when the kings resided at Toulouse, and had as\r\nyet only uncertain possessions in Spain; when the South of Gaul\r\nconstituted the bulk, and almost the whole, of the kingdom. There\r\nis nothing to prove that all that is contained in the\r\n_Breviarium Aniani_, towards the end of the fifth century,\r\nfor the benefit of the Romans of Southern Gaul, subsisted in\r\nSpain until the eighth century, for the benefit of the Goths and\r\nRomans, when merged into a single nation. The silence of the\r\n_Forum judicum_, which is the true code of the Spanish\r\nVisigoths, upon most of these arrangements, proves more against\r\ntheir maintenance than is demonstrated in their favour by the\r\ntext of the _Breviarium_, which was drawn up in another\r\nplace, at an earlier period, and for a portion only of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Abolition Of The Breviarium Aniani.\r\n\r\nII. About a hundred and fifty years after the publication of the\r\n_Breviarium_, the Goths and Romans were united into a single\r\nnation. The collection of laws, successively augmented under the\r\ndifferent reigns, and completed by Chindasuinth, became the sole\r\ncode of the kingdom; all other laws were abolished, and the\r\n_Breviarium_ was necessarily included in this abolition. The\r\ntext of the law of Recesuinth is formal: \"That absolutely none of\r\nthe men of our realm be permitted to lay before the judge, for\r\nthe decision of any affair, any other collection of laws than\r\nthat which has just been published, and according to the order in\r\nwhich the laws are inscribed therein; and this, under penalty of\r\na fine of thirty pounds of gold to our treasury. Any judge who\r\nshould hesitate to decline any other book that might be presented\r\nto him as suited to regulate his decision, will be punished by\r\nthe same fine.\"\r\n\r\n{245}\r\n\r\nM. de Savigny foresaw this objection; and without absolutely\r\ndissembling it, he has tried to weaken it by not quoting the text\r\nof the law of Recesuinth, and by speaking only of the attempts\r\nmade by the Visigothic kings, that Spain should contain only a\r\nsingle nation, and be governed by a single code. These evasions\r\nare in striking contrast with his usual candour. He then makes\r\nuse of the existence of the _defensores_, proof of which is\r\nfound in the _Forum judicum_, to assume the maintenance of\r\nall the prerogatives and liberties attributed to them by the\r\n_Breviarium_. This conclusion is evidently hasty and\r\nexcessive.\r\n\r\nI do not dispute that the towns of Spain were able to retain, or\r\nindeed that they did necessarily retain, some institutions, some\r\nguarantees of municipal liberty. I should not infer their\r\nabsolute disappearance from the silence of the _Forum\r\njudicum_. The despotism of the Barbarian kings, however\r\ncareful it may have been to gather the heritage of Roman maxims,\r\nwas neither as wise nor as circumstantial as that of the\r\nemperors. It allowed the _curiæ_ and their magistrates to\r\ncontinue in existence, and these petty local powers assuredly had\r\nmore reality and independence under its rule than they had\r\npossessed under the Empire. The clergy, principally dwelling in\r\nthe towns, and bound by strong ties to the Roman race, was itself\r\ninterested in protecting them, and the more so, because it\r\nnaturally placed itself at the head of the municipalities. Thus\r\nmuch is certain, that the remnants of institutions of surety and\r\nliberty which existed there, occupy no place in the written laws,\r\nalthough these laws are much more detailed than those of other\r\nBarbarian peoples, and embrace the whole civil order. They could\r\nnot, therefore, be considered as forming a part of the general\r\nconstitution of the kingdom; they neither modified its political\r\ncharacter, nor changed the results of the principles that\r\nprevailed therein.\r\n\r\n{246}\r\n          Gothic Laws Of Spain.\r\n\r\nIf M. de Savigny has looked for the institutions of the Visigoths\r\nin an epoch anterior to the definitive establishment of their\r\ntrue monarchy, and in a collection of laws abolished by the\r\n_Forum judicum_, the author of the dissertation contained in\r\nthe Edinburgh Review has addressed his inquiries to times and\r\ndocuments posterior by four or five centuries to the destruction\r\nof the kingdom of the Visigoths by the Arabs; and by transporting\r\nthe consequences which he has obtained therefrom into the epoch\r\nwhich occupies our attention, he has fallen into an error still\r\nless supported by facts than was that of M. de Savigny. His\r\nresearches and inferences are the following:--\r\n\r\n  \"It must not be supposed that the whole body of the law of the\r\n  Visigoths appears in the twelve books of their code. They had\r\n  their common or traditionary law, still existing in unwritten\r\n  usages and customs, as well as their written law; and we are\r\n  supported by analogy in asserting that this common law often\r\n  spoke, when the statute law was silent. It outlived the\r\n  monarchy; and we now collect it from the _Fueros_ or\r\n  ancient customs of Castile and Leon. The customs in question\r\n  are preserved in the charters of the towns, which gave bye-laws\r\n  to the inhabitants, confirming the unwritten common law of the\r\n  country, sometimes with greater or lesser modifications in the\r\n  detail, but agreeing in general principles. We equally discover\r\n  them in the acts of Cortes, which, to borrow the expression of\r\n  Sir Edward Coke, are often 'affirmances of the common law.' The\r\n  traditionary Fueros of Castile also formed the basis of the\r\n  _Fuero Viejo de Castilla_, which received its last\r\n  revision under Peter the Third. And even Alonso the Wise,\r\n  though he planned the subversion of the ancient jurisprudence\r\n  of his kingdom, admitted into the Partidas such of those\r\n  _Fueros de España_ as relate to the tenures of land, and\r\n  to military service. Consisting of ancient usages, neither\r\n  refined by the learning of the councils nor restrained by the\r\n  power of the kings, the Fueros of Castile and Leon bear a\r\n  nearer affinity to the jurisprudence of the Teutonic nations\r\n  than the written code. The water ordeal is noticed only once,\r\n  in a law newly amended by Flavius Egica. But ordeal by\r\n  compurgation, the most ancient form of trial by jury, and the\r\n  battle ordeal, do not appear at all. Neither do we find any\r\n  notice of the custom of returning military leaders by the\r\n  _verdict of a jury_. All these customs, however, were\r\n  Fueros of Spain in the Middle Ages. Nor could they possibly\r\n  have then existed, had they not been preserved by immemorial\r\n  usage and tradition.\"\r\n\r\n{247}\r\n\r\n         Election Of Adalides.\r\n\r\nThe author then passes these ancient usages in review. The first\r\nto which he refers is the appointment of military leaders by a\r\njury. He traces this custom back to the forests of Germany: and\r\nthen shows how it could not fail to succumb universally beneath\r\nthe establishment of the feudal system, and in consequence of the\r\nhierarchical subordination of persons and lands. He discovers\r\ntraces of this in the nomination, by the people, of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon _heretochs_ and _constables_, who were at\r\nfirst military officers; and also in the election of the kings of\r\nNorway by the verdicts of twelve of the principal men of each\r\nprovince. He then returns to Spain, \"where,\" he says, \"we shall\r\nfind our old Gothic juries employed in electing the chief\r\nofficers of the army and navy of the Castilians, the Adalid, the\r\nAlmocaden, the Alfaqueque, and the Comitre. Who was to be the\r\nAdalid? The question must be answered in the words of the wise\r\nking Alonso. It is said by the ancients that 'the Adalid should\r\nbe endowed with four gifts--the first is wisdom, the second is\r\nheart, the third is good common sense, and the fourth is loyalty;\r\nand when a king or any other great lord wishes to make an Adalid,\r\nhe must call unto himself _twelve of the wisest_ Adalides\r\nthat can be found, and these must _swear_ that they will\r\n_truly say_, if he whom they wish to choose to be an Adalid\r\nhath the four gifts of which we have spoken, and if they answer\r\n_yea_, then they are to make him an Adalid.'\" Here we have\r\nclearly an inquest by twelve men giving their verdict upon oath.\r\nIf it happened that twelve Adalides could not be found, then a\r\nkind of _tales de circumstantibus_ was added to this special\r\njury of Adalides. The king or lord was to make up the full number\r\nof twelve with other men well approved in war and deeds of arms,\r\nand their verdict was as good as if they had been all Adalides.\r\nAnd he who dared to act as an Adalid without being fully elected,\r\nwas to suffer death. \"It was advised in ancient times,\" says\r\nAlonso, \"that they were to have the qualities before mentioned,\r\nbecause it was necessary that they should possess them, in order\r\nto be able to guide the troops and armies in time of war, and\r\ntherefore they were called Adalides, which is equivalent to\r\n_guides_ (_que quiere tanto decir como guiadores_).\"\r\n\r\n{248}\r\n\r\n         Admission Of An Adalid.\r\n\r\nThe author is, therefore, of opinion that this word comes from\r\n_adal, adel_, noble, and _leid, lead, leiten_, to guide\r\nor conduct. The Adalid was the guide or chief of the\r\n_Almogavars_, or cavalry soldiers. The _Adalid mayor_\r\nwas commander-in-chief of all the Almogavars, or Castilian\r\ncavalry.\r\n\r\nAfter his election by this species of jury, the Adalid was thus\r\nsolemnly admitted to his office. \"The king gave him rich\r\ngarments, and a sword and a horse, and arms of _wood and\r\niron_, according to the customs of the country. By a _rico\r\nhombre_, a lord of knights, the sword was to be girt, and then\r\na shield was placed upon the ground, the future Adalid stepped\r\nupon it, and the king drew the sword out of its scabbard, and put\r\nit naked in his hand. And now as many of the twelve Adalids as\r\ncan assemble round the shield, grasp its edge, and lift him up as\r\nhigh as they may: they turn his face towards the east.--In the\r\nname of God,\" exclaims the Adalid, \"I defy all the enemies of the\r\nfaith, and of my lord the king, and of his land.\" And, thus\r\nspeaking, he lifted up his arm, and struck a stroke downward, and\r\nhe then struck another stroke across, thus describing in the air\r\nthe sweet and holy sign of redemption, and he repeated this\r\nchallenge four times towards each of the quarters of the world.\r\nThen the Adalid sheathed his sword, and the king placed a pennon\r\nin his hand, saying, \"_I grant unto thee that henceforward thou\r\nart to be an Adalid._\" An Adalid might have risen to command\r\nfrom the lowest rank in the Castilian army. He might have been a\r\n_peon_ or foot-soldier, but he became the fellow and\r\ncompanion of the hereditary nobles, the lords of vassals, and the\r\n_ricos hombres._\" In this ceremony, the author perceives a\r\nrepetition of the forms used at the election of kings among the\r\nGermans, or at least at the choice of military leaders; _duces\r\nex virtute sumunt_.\r\n\r\n{249}\r\n\r\n         Election Of Officers By A Jury.\r\n\r\nI would by no means affirm that there does not exist, in this\r\nmode of choosing captains, in the concurrence of these twelve\r\njurymen, and even in the number twelve itself, any remnant of old\r\nGermanic customs. This much is evident, that what has just been\r\ndescribed was much rather a sort of chivalric ceremony in\r\nconnection with the elevation of a man to a superior rank, than\r\nthe election of a barbaric chief; all the forms, all the details\r\nof the elevation of an Adalid, remind us much more of chivalric\r\nusage than of Germanic custom; and it is a strange anachronism to\r\nsuppose that all this took place, five hundred years before,\r\namong the Visigoths, notwithstanding that no mention is made of\r\nit in any historic monument, and, what is still more conclusive,\r\nnotwithstanding that the general state of manners at that time\r\ngives no hint of anything of the kind. It is much more probable\r\nthat these customs originated among the Goths during their\r\nstruggle against the Arabs, in the mountains of Northern Spain,\r\nand in consequence of the new direction of mingled feudalism and\r\nliberty, which was imparted to their manners by this new\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nThe _Almocadene_ or captain of foot soldiers, the\r\n_Alfaqueque_ or officer employed to treat for the ransom of\r\ncaptives from the Moors, and the _Comitre_ or captain of a\r\nship, were appointed in a similar manner, and by the\r\nrecommendation of a jury composed, not of members of the class to\r\nwhich the candidate belonged, but to members of the class to\r\nwhich he aspired. This circumstance alone settles the question;\r\nfor it is a result of chivalric, and not of Barbarian manners; it\r\nreminds us of the squire who was dubbed knight by knights, and\r\nnot of the warrior who was chosen or judged by his peers.\r\n\r\nI shall not follow the author in his researches on ordeal by\r\nboiling water and by fire, or upon trial by combat. Although we\r\nmeet with traces of these customs in the old monuments of some\r\nBarbarian legislations, they were not the common law of modern\r\npeoples, during the first epoch of their establishment on the\r\nRoman territory. It was at a later period, and by the influence\r\neither of the corruption of religious ideas by superstition, or\r\nof the military organization of the feudal system, that they\r\nbecame developed, recognized, and formed into a veritable\r\njurisprudence. The general facts of Europe do not, therefore,\r\nauthorize us to conclude that, because they existed among the\r\nSpaniards in the fourteenth century, they also existed among the\r\nVisigoths in the seventh century. The almost absolute silence of\r\nthe historic monuments of the first epoch, here retains all its\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\n{250}\r\n\r\n         Compurgation.\r\n\r\nThe facts relative to compurgation, by the oath of a certain\r\nnumber of witnesses, are more important and more curious.\r\n\"Compurgation,\" says our author, \"is directed in express terms in\r\nall the Teutonic laws; but it does not appear to have been\r\nadmissible in trials conducted according to the forms prescribed\r\nby the _Fuero juzgo_. Yet afterwards, this ordeal was widely\r\nspread as a _fuero_, both in civil and criminal trials.\r\nThough discountenanced by the legislature, it was retained in\r\npractice; and a forcible illustration is thus given of the\r\nstubbornness with which the Goths adhered to their usages and\r\ncustoms. _Trial by jury_, through it, in its germ was felt\r\nto be a benefit.\"\r\n\r\n\"As an ancient and general usage of Castile, the trial is\r\nsanctioned in the _Fuero Viejo_. As a local custom or\r\nbye-law of the cities of Castile and Leon and their dependencies,\r\nit was very frequently established, or rather _declared_, by\r\nthe charters granted by their founders.\r\n\r\n\"Three thousand _sueldos_, according to the _Fuero\r\nViejo_, were paid for dishonouring the palace of the king, or\r\nspoiling his castle; and five hundred _sueldos_ was the\r\nprice of the head of the _merino_, or the composition for\r\nscandalizing him; and every man who wished to save himself from\r\nthe payment of these mulcts, was to defend himself by the oath of\r\n_twelve men, for such was the usage of Castile in the old\r\ntime_. When accused of the death of another _fijo\r\nd'algo_, the suspected noble defended himself by the oath of\r\neleven other _fijos d'algo_, himself _the twelfth_,\r\nand, as true knights, they were all _sworn_ upon the Gospel\r\nBook, with their spurs upon their heels. There were two insults\r\nonly which gave a Dueña, or a squire, the right of complaining\r\nthat a _fijo d'algo_ had scandalized them, viz., a blow or a\r\nwound, or the robbery of their mules or garments. Within three\r\ndays, the party so injured by a caitiff knight was obliged to\r\ncomplain of the offence, and to disclose the injury to the\r\n_fijos d'algo_ of the town, the _labradores_, and to\r\nthe inmates of the _fijos d'algo_, if there were any, and to\r\ncause the town-bell to be rung, saying, \"such a one hath thus\r\ndishonoured me.\"\r\n{251}\r\nThese formalities having been observed, the _fijo d'algo_\r\nwas bound to answer the complaint; reparation was made if he\r\nconfessed it, by forfeiting five hundred _sueldos_, the\r\nprice of his own head; but if he denied it, he was to clear\r\nhimself by the oath of eleven other _fijos d'algo_, himself\r\nthe _twelfth_. But a _labrador_ accused of injuring a\r\n_fijo d'algo_ was not to be admitted to defend himself by\r\nhis peers; and he was unfairly compelled to swear with eleven\r\n_fijos d'algo_, himself the twelfth.\r\n\r\n\"These customs are taken from the general code. In peculiar\r\ndistricts, compurgation was so much in vogue, that compurgatrixes\r\nwere allowed to female culprits. At Anguas, as well as in other\r\ntowns, a woman charged with theft could defend herself by the\r\noaths of a jury of other women. More whimsical was the Fuero of\r\nCuenca, which is passing strange, both for the spirit of the law\r\nand the terms in which it is expressed. If perchance any husband\r\nsuspected that his wife had planted horns upon his head, although\r\nhe was not able to prove the fact by evidence, the wife was to\r\njustify herself by swearing to her chastity, with twelve good\r\nwives of the neighbourhood; and if they pronounced her to be\r\npure, her husband was obliged to be persuaded that she was so.\r\n\r\n\"The customs of St. Sebastien in Guipuscoa, allowed an odd kind\r\nof proceeding, resembling the assessment of damages by the\r\nverdict of a jury. The ravisher was to pay the price of\r\nvirginity, or he was to marry the object of his ungovernable\r\npassion; which punishment, as the charter wisely observes, 'is\r\nfully equal to a fine.' But if she, who had been a maid, was\r\nunworthy of becoming his wife, he was to provide her with such a\r\nhusband as she might have reasonably expected to have obtained\r\nprevious to her mishap, 'according to the estimation of the\r\nalcalde, and of twelve good men of St. Sebastien.'\r\n\r\n\"The fullest directions concerning the use of the ordeal are\r\ncontained in the charter of Molina. Don Molrique de Lara\r\nincorporated the town of Molina, the seigniory of the noble house\r\nof Lara, in the year 1152. His charter may be quoted as the most\r\nvaluable record concerning the ancient municipal jurisprudence of\r\nCastile which has yet been published, as it displays the entire\r\nconstitution and government of a Castilian town.  ...  Fines,\r\naccording to the old Gothic law, were enacted at Molina for\r\nwounds and maims. The accuser was to support his charge by three\r\n'_vecinos_' or burghers of the town, if the offence was\r\ncommitted within its walls.\r\n{252}\r\nTwo _vecinos_ sufficed if without. And, in default of full\r\nproof, the culprit either swore with twelve _vecinos_, or\r\nfought with the accuser; but the latter had the choice of the\r\nordeal.  ...  When a murder had been committed, if one of those\r\nengaged in the fray took the guilt on his own head, saying,\r\n'_I killed him_,' the others were 'to save themselves with\r\ntwelve true burghers,'--_los otros salvense con doce vecinos\r\nderecheros_. It might happen, that none would confess the\r\ncrime; and as all were then equally liable to suspicion, the\r\nrelations of the dead man were at liberty to select any one as\r\nthe murderer, 'just as they thought fit;' after which the\r\nsupposed murderer named eleven relations of the slain, and\r\nthese, together with the accuser, swore to his being guilty or\r\nnot guilty. Unanimity was required; and if one or two would not\r\nswear, that is to say, if they could not agree with the\r\nmajority, each one who was so dissentient swore with twelve,\r\nthat neither he, nor any one for his use, had received any\r\nbribe; then he was discharged. But if the defendant did not\r\n'fall' by the withdrawing of his juror, he was at liberty to\r\nname another. This proceeding is remarkable; a new aspect is\r\ngiven to the ordeal by calling in the compurgators to swear with\r\nthe accuser instead of the accused; and in this form it is,\r\nperhaps, more closely assimilated to a jury-trial. It may be\r\nobserved, that a practice once prevailed in England of\r\nwithdrawing the dissentient jurors, and replacing them by\r\nothers, till an unanimous verdict was obtained.\"\r\n\r\nSuch are the facts which the author of these researches has\r\ncollected on the existence of ancient Germanic customs, or\r\nanalogous usages, in the towns of Castile and Leon, dating from\r\nthe twelfth century. He unhesitatingly concludes therefrom that\r\nthese same customs existed in the sixth and seventh centuries\r\namong the Spanish Visigoths, and formed a part of their\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Errors Of The Preceding Theory.\r\n\r\nIt is inconvenient to prove that facts are not true, for it\r\ndevolves on him who affirms them to prove that they are so; and,\r\nin such a case as this, when we speak of epochs separated by five\r\nor six centuries, and by such a revolution as the dispossession\r\nof a people and a foreign conquest, inductions are not\r\nsufficient.\r\n{253}\r\nThe _Forum judicum_ is absolutely silent upon the\r\nappointment of military leaders, and upon compurgation by juries;\r\nnay, more, this latter institution is incompatible with the\r\narrangements of this code in reference to judges and the\r\nadministration of justice. No other contemporary authority\r\ncontradicts the _Forum judicum_. Must we, upon the authority\r\nof facts of much more recent date, and which refer to an entirely\r\ndifferent state of civilization, refuse to believe proofs so\r\ndirect, and testimonies so positive?\r\n\r\nI am aware of all that may be said about the disorders of these\r\ntimes, the continual gaps in the laws, and the disposition of\r\nlegislators to omit precisely those usages which were most simple\r\nand universal, as though they had no need to be consecrated or\r\neven indicated by formal enactment. It is, in fact, very possible\r\nthat the practice of compurgation by juries was not completely\r\nunknown to the Visigoths; it recurs in all Germanic customs, and\r\nit may not have disappeared either entirely or all at once, even\r\nafter the introduction of a code derived principally from the\r\nRoman laws. But it is impossible to believe, in spite of this\r\ncode, that it continued to be the common law, the fundamental\r\ninstitution, the veritable judicial system of the nation.\r\n\r\nIt is more easy to explain, with likelihood, the existence of\r\nthese practices among the Spanish Goths of the twelfth century,\r\nthan to justify, without proofs, or rather in opposition to all\r\nevidence, the arbitrary supposition of their prevalence among the\r\nVisigoths of the seventh. Such institutions have in themselves\r\nsomething of spontaneity; they correspond to a certain degree of\r\ncivilization, to a certain state of social institutions; we meet\r\nwith them under forms more or less similar, but fundamentally\r\nanalogous, not only among all the Germanic peoples, but also\r\namong nearly all those barbaric peoples which, scarcely issued\r\nfrom a nomadic life, begin to establish themselves on a new\r\nterritory, after they have conquered it. Now, the destruction of\r\nthe monarchy of the Visigoths by the Arabs suspended the course\r\nof the institutions which it had received two centuries before,\r\nbroke off the councils of Toledo, crushed or greatly diminished\r\nthe predominance of the clergy, and, in fine, put a stop to the\r\ncivilization which had commenced, and gave to affairs an entirely\r\nnew direction.\r\n\r\n{254}\r\n\r\n         Birth Of Free Institutions.\r\n\r\nScattered among the mountains, frequently wandering, separated\r\ninto various bands, those of the Goths who did not submit to the\r\nconquerors, returned, so to speak, towards the life which their\r\nancestors led in the forests of Germany. Roman institutions,\r\nRoman maxims, all that collection of laws and ideas which they\r\nhad received from the clergy, and which had prevailed over their\r\nown habits, disappeared almost necessarily in this shock, or at\r\nleast were retained only by those Goths who remained under the\r\ndominion of the Mussulmans. The companions of Pelagius, up to a\r\ncertain point, became Germans once more, from sheer necessity. It\r\nwas after this involuntary return to their primitive condition,\r\nand, by consequence, to their ancient institutions, that they\r\nresumed the offensive against the Arabs, and reconquered Spain by\r\ndegrees, bringing back with them those political and judicial\r\ncustoms, usages, and practices, which they had partially\r\nregained. Free institutions, moreover, could not fail to regain\r\nvitality at this period; for they alone can supply strength in\r\ntimes of danger or misfortune. It was not in the power of the\r\ncustoms of the _officium palatinum_, and of the maxims of\r\nthe councils of Toledo, to restore the Goths to their subjugated\r\ncountry, and reinstate the descendants of Chindasuinth upon the\r\nthrone of their fathers. The participation of the people in\r\npublic affairs, the sternness of Barbarian manners, and the\r\nenergy of irregular liberty, could alone produce such effects.\r\nThere is every reason to believe that the institutions of Spain,\r\nafter the re-establishment of the kingdoms of Castile, Leon,\r\nArragon, &c, were new institutions, and the result of the new\r\nposition of the Goths, much more than the legacy of the ancient\r\nVisigoths. We find proofs of this in the general Cortes of the\r\nkingdom, in the constitutions and liberties of the towns, in the\r\nwhole political order of the State, which has no connection\r\nwhatever with the old monarchy, and follows much more naturally\r\nas a result of the condition and necessities of new monarchies.\r\nThe political system established by the councils of Toledo and\r\nthe _Forum judicum_ could not have taken deep root; it fell\r\nbefore necessities which it was unable to meet.\r\n\r\n{255}\r\n              Conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe _Forum judicum_ itself would perhaps have completely\r\nsuccumbed, had it not continued to be the law of those Goths who\r\nhad submitted to the yoke of the Moors; it moreover regulated\r\ncivil order, which is always more firmly fixed, and less\r\ninfluenced by revolutions. It therefore continued, in this\r\nrespect, to be the general law of Spain; whilst political order\r\nassumed a new form and was regulated by other institutions.\r\n\r\nThe _Forum judicum_ and contemporary authorities are the\r\nonly true source at which we can study the political institutions\r\nof the ancient Visigoths; a source which is doubtless incomplete,\r\nand which does not inform us of all that existed; a source which,\r\nprobably even, especially neglected to gather up what still\r\nremained of Germanic manners and habits, but which it is\r\nimpossible to repudiate in order to admit facts and general\r\ninstitutions which are directly contrary to it. The consequences\r\nwhich I have deduced from these original and contemporary\r\nauthorities, therefore, still subsist, and determine the true\r\npolitical system of the monarchy of the Visigoths. The imperial\r\ngovernment, and ecclesiastical theories, were its constituent\r\nelements. These elements prevailed over Germanic customs. They\r\nwere doubtless modified in order that they might be adapted to a\r\nBarbarian people; but, by modification, they gained dominion, and\r\nbecame the general form, the fundamental law, of the State. If\r\nthe Spanish Goths afterwards entered upon a course more analogous\r\nto that pursued by other modern nations of the same origin, it is\r\nin the invasion of the Arabs, in the second conquest of Spain by\r\nthe re-Germanized Goths, and in the effects of this great\r\nrevolution, but not in the institutions of the monarchy of the\r\nVisigoths, that we may discern the causes of this procedure.\r\n\r\n\r\n         End Of Part I.\r\n\r\n{256}\r\n\r\n{257}\r\n\r\n                 Part II.\r\n\r\n   Essays Of Representative Government In England,\r\n\r\n From The Conquest Till The Reign Of The Tudors.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Lecture I.\r\n\r\n  Subject of the course: the history of the origin and\r\n  establishment of representative government in Europe.\r\n\r\n  Different aspects under which history is considered at various\r\n  epochs.\r\n\r\n  Poetic history; philosophic history; political history.\r\n\r\n  Disposition of our time to consider history under these various\r\n  aspects.\r\n\r\n  Fundamental principle and essential characteristics of\r\n  representative government.\r\n\r\n  Existence of this principle and these characteristics in\r\n  England at all times.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Subject of the course.\r\n\r\nI think it necessary to remind you, gentlemen, of the plan which\r\nI adopted last year with regard to our study of the political\r\ninstitutions of Europe. The essential object of that plan was to\r\ngive some unity and compactness to this vast history. And this is\r\nnot an arbitrary and self-chosen object. In the development of\r\nour continent, all its peoples and all its governments are\r\nconnected together; in spite of all struggles and separations,\r\nthere is really some unity and compactness in European\r\ncivilization. This unity, which has been revealing itself from\r\nday to day, is now evident; never have geographical limits\r\npossessed less sway than in our times; never has such a community\r\nof ideas, feelings, aspirations, and efforts united, in spite of\r\nterritorial demarcations, so great a mass of men. That which is\r\nnow revealed has been labouring for more than twelve centuries to\r\nmanifest itself; this external and apparent community has not\r\nalways existed; but such has always been, at bottom, the unity of\r\nEuropean civilization, that it is impossible thoroughly to\r\nunderstand the history of any of the great modern peoples without\r\nconsidering the history of Europe as a whole, and contemplating\r\nthe course pursued by humanity in general. It is a vast drama in\r\nwhich every people has its part to perform, and with the general\r\nevents of which we must be acquainted in order to understand the\r\nparticular scenes connected therewith.\r\n\r\n{258}\r\n\r\n         Epochs Of European History.\r\n\r\nI have divided the history of the political institutions of\r\nEurope into four great epochs, which are distinguished from each\r\nother by essentially different characteristics. The first is the\r\nbarbarian epoch; a time of conflict and confusion, in which no\r\nsociety could be established, no institution be founded and\r\nbecome regularly prevalent in any part of Europe; this epoch\r\nextends from the fifth to the tenth century. The second is the\r\nfeudal epoch, and extends from the tenth to the fourteenth\r\ncentury. The third is the epoch of efforts towards constitutional\r\nmonarchy; feudalism declines, the populations become free, and\r\nroyalty employs them to extend and augment its power; this epoch\r\nembraces the period from the fourteenth to the sixteenth century.\r\nIn the fourth period, on the Continent, all efforts towards a\r\nrepresentative system have failed or almost entirely disappeared;\r\npure monarchy prevails. England alone decidedly obtains a\r\nconstitutional government. This epoch lasts from the sixteenth\r\ncentury to the French Revolution.\r\n\r\nThese epochs were not determined by an arbitrary choice,--their\r\ndivision results from the general facts which characterize them.\r\nThey will not all form the subject of this course of lectures. I\r\nwish to study the political institutions of Europe with you, and\r\nrepresentative government is the centre towards which all our\r\nstudies tend. Where I perceive no trace of the representative\r\nsystem, and no direct effort to produce it, I turn aside, and\r\ntransfer my attention to some other quarter. Nor shall I merely\r\nlimit our studies in reference to epochs only; I shall limit them\r\nalso in respect to places. Last year, in my lectures on the first\r\nepoch, I did not follow the progress of political institutions in\r\nthe whole of Europe, but confined my observations to France,\r\nSpain, and England. We have now to study the third epoch; but the\r\nStates-General of France and the Cortes of Spain were only\r\nunfruitful attempts at representative government. I shall\r\ntherefore postpone our study of them, and devote this year's\r\ncourse to the attentive examination of the origin of\r\nrepresentative government in England, the only country in which\r\nit received uninterrupted and successful development. This study\r\nis particularly necessary to us at the present day, and we are\r\nourselves well-disposed to enter upon it with an earnest desire\r\nto reap advantage from it.\r\n\r\n{259}\r\n              Aspects Of History.\r\n\r\nAccording to their political state, and in the degree of their\r\ncivilization, do the peoples consider history under various\r\naspects, and look to it for various kinds of interest. In the\r\nearly ages of society, whilst all is new and attractive to the\r\nyouthful imagination of man, he demands poetical interest; the\r\nmemories of the past form the groundwork of brilliant and simple\r\nnarratives, fitted to charm an eager and easily satisfied\r\ncuriosity. If, in such a community, where social existence is in\r\nfull vigour, and the human mind is in a state of excitement,\r\nHerodotus reads to the Greeks assembled at Olympia his patriotic\r\nnarratives, and the discoveries of his voyages, the Greeks\r\ndelight in them as in songs of Homer. If civilization is but\r\nlittle advanced--if men live more isolated--if 'country,' in the\r\nconcrete, at least, exists but slightly for them,--we find simple\r\nchronicles intermingled with fables and legends, but always\r\nmarked with that _naïf_ and poetical character which, in\r\nsuch a condition of existence, the human mind requires in all\r\nthings. Such are the European chronicles from the tenth to the\r\nfifteenth century. If, at a later period, civilization becomes\r\ndeveloped in a country without the coeval establishment of\r\nliberty, without an energetic and extensive political existence,\r\nwhen the period of enlightenment, of wealth, and of leisure, does\r\narrive, men look for philosophical interest in history; it no\r\nlonger belongs to the field of poetry; it loses its simplicity;\r\nit no longer wears its former real and living physiognomy;\r\nindividual characters take up less space, and no longer appear\r\nunder living forms; the mention of names becomes more rare; the\r\nnarrative of events, and the description of men, are more its\r\npretext than its subject; all becomes generalized; readers demand\r\na summary of the development of civilization, a sort of theory of\r\nthe peoples and of events; history becomes a series of\r\ndissertations on the progress of the human race, and the\r\nhistorian seems only to call up the skeleton of the past, in\r\norder to hang upon it general ideas and philosophic reflections.\r\nThis occurred in the last century; the English historians of that\r\nperiod, Robertson, Gibbon, and Hume, have represented history\r\nunder that aspect; and most of the German writers still follow\r\nthe same system. The philosophy of history predominates; history,\r\nproperly so called, is not to be found in them.\r\n\r\n{260}\r\n         The History Of Free Nations.\r\n\r\nBut if advanced civilization and a great development of the human\r\nintellect coincide, in a nation, with an animated and keen\r\npolitical existence; if the struggle for liberty, by exciting the\r\nmind, provoke energy of character; if the activity of public life\r\nbe added to the general claims of thought, history appears in\r\nanother light; it becomes, so to speak, practical. No longer is\r\nit required to charm easily excited imaginations by its\r\nnarratives, nor to satisfy by its meditations active intellects\r\ndebarred from exercising themselves upon aught but generalities.\r\nBut men expect from it experience analogous to the wants they\r\nfeel, to the life they live; they desire to understand the real\r\nnature and hidden springs of institutions; to enter into the\r\nmovements of parties, to follow them in their combinations, to\r\nstudy the secret of the influence of the masses, and of the\r\naction of individuals; men and things must resuscitate before\r\nthem, no longer merely as an interest or diversion, but as a\r\nrevelation of how rights, liberties, and power are to be\r\nacquired, exercised, and defended; how to combine opinions,\r\ninterests, passions, the necessities of circumstances, all the\r\nelements of active political life. That is what history becomes\r\nfor free nations; it is from that point of view that Thucydides\r\nwrote the history of the Peloponnesian war, Lord Clarendon and\r\nBishop Burnet that of the English Revolution.\r\n\r\nGenerally, and by the very nature of things, it is in regular\r\norder, and at distant intervals, that history assumes one or\r\nother of these various kinds of interest in the eyes of the\r\npeople. A taste for simple narratives, a liking for philosophic\r\ngeneralizations, and a craving for political instruction, almost\r\nalways belong to very different times and degrees of\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\n\r\n       Historic Requirements Of The Present Age.\r\n\r\nBy a rare concurrence of circumstances, all these tastes and\r\nacquirements seem to unite at the present day; and history is now\r\nsusceptible amongst us of all these kinds of interest. If it\r\nnarrate to us with truth and simplicity the first attempts at\r\nsocial life, the manners of infant nations; that singular state\r\nof society in which ideas are few in number but keen, and wants\r\nare energetic although unvaried, in which all the pretensions of\r\nbarbarian force struggle against all the habits of wild liberty,\r\nit will find us capable of understanding such a recital, and\r\nsomewhat disposed to be charmed therewith.\r\n{261}\r\nFifty years ago, a faithful picture of this age in the life of\r\npeoples would have appeared only coarse and revolting; its\r\ninteresting and poetical character would have been neither\r\nrelished nor understood; conventionalisms were then turned into\r\nhabits, and factitious manners held sway over the whole of\r\nsociety; Homer himself, in an age so destitute of simplicity and\r\nnaturalness, was admired on hearsay only; and if no one dared to\r\ncall in question his title to glory, he was pitied for having\r\nbeen obliged to shed the lustre of his genius upon an epoch of\r\nbarbarism and ignorance. Prodigious events have since renewed the\r\nstate of society, broken up old forms, conventional habits, and\r\nfactitious manners; simple ideas and natural feelings have\r\nresumed their empire; a kind of rejuvenescence has taken place in\r\nthe minds of men, and they have become capable of understanding\r\nman at every degree of civilization, and of taking pleasure in\r\nthe simple and poetic narratives of infant society. In our days\r\nit has been felt that barbarian times also deserved, in some\r\nrespects, to be called heroic times; in our days, mankind has\r\ndiscovered the faculty, as well as the necessity, of obtaining a\r\ntrue knowledge of the institutions, ideas, and manners of\r\npeoples, on their entrance into social life. Thus this section of\r\nhistory has regained an interest which it had ceased to possess;\r\nit is no longer regarded as the patrimony of the erudite; it has\r\nbeen seized upon by novelists themselves, and the public have\r\ntaken delight in following their footsteps.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the need of broad philosophical views of the\r\ncourse of human affairs and the progress of society, has gained\r\nstrength instead of becoming extinguished; we have not ceased to\r\nlook to facts for something more than mere narratives; we still\r\nexpect them to be summed up in general ideas, and to furnish us\r\nwith those great results which throw light on the sciences of\r\nlegislation and political economy, and on the vast study of the\r\ndestiny of the human race. Far, then, from being less inclined to\r\nconsider history under a philosophic point of view, it seems to\r\nhave acquired a wider interest in this respect. More than ever,\r\nwe feel the necessity of tracing events back to their primitive\r\ncauses, of reducing them to their simplest expression, of\r\npenetrating into their remotest effects; and if old chronicles\r\nhave regained their charm in our eyes, the great combinations of\r\nhistoric philosophy still constitute a pressing necessity of our\r\nminds.\r\n\r\n{262}\r\n\r\n       Necessity Of An Acquaintance With History.\r\n\r\nFinally, our birth into public life, the institutions that we\r\npossess and that we will not lose, that aurora of liberty which,\r\nthough it arose in the midst of tempests, is not destined to\r\nperish therein, the past which we leave behind us, the present\r\nwith which we are busied, the future which awaits us, in fine,\r\nour entire position--all impart to history, considered under the\r\npolitical point of view, the most imperious interest. Before our\r\ntime, the movement of public life, the game of parties, the war\r\nof factions, the struggles of assemblies, all the agitations and\r\ndevelopments of power and liberty, were things which men had\r\nheard of but had not seen, which they had read of in books but\r\nwhich were not actually existing around the reader. These things\r\nhave occurred, and are now occurring under our very eyes; every\r\nconsideration leads us to study them, every circumstance aids us\r\nto comprehend them. And not to us alone has political life been\r\nrestored: it has returned into history, hitherto cold and vague\r\nto the minds of those who had not been struck by the real visions\r\nof the scenes which it relates. And while regaining our\r\ncomprehension of history, we have also become aware of the\r\ncounsels and the lessons which it can furnish us; its utility no\r\nlonger consists, as formerly, in a general idea, a sort of moral\r\nand literary dogma professed by writers rather than adopted and\r\npractised by the public. Now, a more or less thorough\r\nacquaintance with history, and especially with that of free\r\npeoples, is not merely an accomplishment of cultivated minds; it\r\nis a necessity to every citizen who feels desirous to take part\r\nin the affairs of his country, or merely to appreciate them\r\ncorrectly. And thus this great study now presents itself to us\r\nwith all the kinds of interest that it is able to offer, because\r\nwe have in us ability to consider it under all its aspects, and\r\nto seek and to find all that it contains.\r\n\r\n{263}\r\n\r\n         Subject Of The Present Course.\r\n\r\nSuch are the motives which induce me to select the history of the\r\npolitical institutions of England as the subject of this course\r\nof lectures: Here, in effect, history considered under its three\r\ndifferent aspects, presents itself with the greatest simplicity\r\nand richness. Nowhere have the primitive manners of modern\r\npeoples been preserved for a longer period, or exercised so\r\ndecisive an influence upon the institutions of a country. Nowhere\r\ndo great philosophical considerations spring with greater\r\nabundance from the contemplation of events and men. Here, in\r\nfine, representative government, the special object of our study,\r\ndeveloped itself without interruption, received into its bosom\r\nand fertilized by its alliance the religious movement imparted to\r\nEurope in the sixteenth century, and thus became the starting\r\npoint of the political reformation which is now beginning on the\r\nContinent.\r\n\r\nIt is by no means my intention to relate to you the history of\r\nEngland. I intend merely to consider it under its political point\r\nof view; and even under this point of view, we shall not study\r\nall the institutions of the kingdom. Representative government is\r\nour theme; and we shall therefore follow the history of the\r\nParliament step by step. We shall only refer to judicial,\r\nadministrative, and municipal institutions in so far as they are\r\nconnected with representative government, and have contributed\r\neither to form it, or to determine its character.\r\n\r\nLast year, before entering upon our examination of facts, I\r\nattempted to define with precision what we ought to understand by\r\nrepresentative government. Before seeking for its existence, I\r\ndesired to know by what signs we might discern its presence. Now\r\nthat we are about to study the history of the only representative\r\ngovernment which, until our days, has existed with full vitality\r\nin Europe, I think it well to recapitulate some of these ideas.\r\n\r\nI have said that I had no very high opinion of the division of\r\ngovernments by publicists, into monarchical, aristocratic, and\r\ndemocratic; and that, in my opinion, it was by their essential\r\nprinciple, by their general and internal idea, that governments\r\nwere characterized and distinguished. The most general idea that\r\nwe can seek out in a government is its theory of sovereignty,\r\nthat is, the manner in which it conceives, places, and attributes\r\nthe right of giving law and carrying it into execution in\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n{264}\r\n         Principle Of Representative Government.\r\n\r\nThere are two great theories of sovereignty. One seeks for it and\r\nplaces it in some one of the real forces which exist upon the\r\nearth, no matter whether it be the people, the monarch, or the\r\nchief men of the people. The other maintains that sovereignty as\r\na right can exist nowhere upon earth, and ought to be attributed\r\nto no power, for no earthly power can fully know and constantly\r\ndesire truth, reason, and justice,--the only sources of\r\nsovereignty as a right, and which ought also to be the rule of\r\nsovereignty in fact. The first theory of sovereignty founds\r\nabsolute power, whatever may be the form of the government. The\r\nsecond combats absolute power in all its forms, and recognises\r\nits legitimacy in no case. It is not true to say that of these\r\ntwo theories, one or the other reigns exclusively in the various\r\ngovernments of the world. These two theories commingle in a\r\ncertain measure; for nothing is completely destitute of truth or\r\nperfectly free from error. Nevertheless, one or the other always\r\ndominates in every form of government, and may be considered as\r\nits principle.\r\n\r\nThe true theory of sovereignty, that is, the radical illegitimacy\r\nof all absolute power, whatever may be its name and place, is the\r\nprinciple of representative government.\r\n\r\nIn fact, in representative government, absolute power,\r\nsovereignty as a right, inhere in none of the powers which concur\r\nto form the government: they must agree to make the law; and even\r\nwhen they have agreed, instead of accepting for ever the absolute\r\npower which actually results from their agreement, the\r\nrepresentative system subjects this power to the variableness of\r\nelection. And the electoral power itself is not absolute, for it\r\nis confined to the choice of the men who shall have a share in\r\nthe government.\r\n\r\nIt is, moreover, the character of that system, which nowhere\r\nadmits the legitimacy of absolute power, to compel the whole body\r\nof citizens incessantly, and on every occasion, to seek after\r\nreason, justice, and truth, which should ever regulate actual\r\npower. The representative system does this,\r\n\r\n  1. by discussion, which compels existing powers to seek after\r\n  truth in common;\r\n\r\n  2. by publicity, which places these powers when occupied in\r\n  this search, under the eyes of the citizens; and\r\n\r\n  3, by the liberty of the press, which stimulates the citizens\r\n  themselves to seek after truth, and to tell it to power.\r\n\r\n{265}\r\n\r\n       Characteristics Of Representative Government.\r\n\r\nFinally, the necessary consequence of the true theory of\r\nsovereignty is, that all actual power is responsible. If, in\r\nfact, no actual power possesses sovereignty as a right, they are\r\nall obliged to prove that they have sought after truth, and have\r\ntaken it for their rule; and they must legitimize their title by\r\ntheir acts, under penalty of being taxed with illegitimacy. The\r\nresponsibility of power is, in fact, inherent in the\r\nrepresentative system; it is the only system which makes it one\r\nof its fundamental conditions.\r\n\r\nAfter having recognised the principle of representative\r\ngovernment, we investigated its external characteristics, that is\r\nto say, the forms which necessarily accompany the principle, and\r\nby which alone it can manifest its existence. These forms we\r\nreduced to three:\r\n\r\n  1. division of powers;\r\n\r\n  2. election; and\r\n\r\n  3. publicity.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to convince ourselves that these\r\ncharacteristics necessarily flow from the principle of\r\nrepresentative government. Indeed,\r\n\r\n  1. all sole power in fact soon becomes absolute in right. It is\r\n  therefore necessary that all power in fact should be conscious\r\n  of dependence. \"All unity,\" says Pascal, \"that is not\r\n  multitude, is tyranny.\" Hence results the necessity for two\r\n  Houses of Parliament. If there be only one, the executive power\r\n  either suppresses it, or falls into so subaltern a condition\r\n  that there would soon remain only the absolute power of the\r\n  single House of Parliament.\r\n\r\n  2. Unless election occurred frequently to place power in new\r\n  hands, that power which derived its right from itself would\r\n  soon become absolute in right; this is the tendency of all\r\n  aristocracies.\r\n\r\n  3. Publicity, which connects power with society, is the best\r\n  guarantee against the usurpation of sovereignty as a right by\r\n  the actual power.\r\n\r\nRepresentative government can neither be established nor\r\ndeveloped without assuming, sooner or later, these three\r\ncharacteristics; they are the natural consequences of its\r\nprinciple; but they do not necessarily co-exist, and\r\nrepresentative government may exist without their union.\r\n\r\nThis was the case in England. It is impossible not to enquire why\r\nrepresentative government prevailed in that country, and not in\r\nthe other States of the Continent. For, indeed, the Barbarians\r\nwho settled in Great Britain had the same origin and the same\r\nprimitive manners as those who, after the fall of the Roman\r\nEmpire, overran Europe; and it was not in the midst of very\r\ndifferent circumstances that they consolidated their dominion in\r\nthat country.\r\n\r\n{266}\r\n\r\nFrom the fifth to the twelfth century, we find no more traces of\r\ntrue representative government in England than upon the\r\nContinent; its institutions were analogous to those of the other\r\nEuropean nations; and we behold in every land the conflict of the\r\nthree systems of free, feudal, and monarchical institutions.\r\n\r\nWe cannot fully resolve this question beforehand, and in a\r\ngeneral manner. We shall answer it gradually, as we advance in\r\nthe examination of facts. We shall see by what successive and\r\nvaried causes political institutions took a different course in\r\nEngland to that which they pursued on the Continent. We may,\r\nhowever, indicate at once the great fact which, from a very early\r\nperiod, determined the character and direction of British\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Division Of Power.\r\n\r\nThe first of the great external characteristics of representative\r\ngovernment, division of power, is met with in every age, in the\r\ngovernment of England. Never was the government concentrated in\r\nthe hands of the king alone; under the name of the\r\n_Wittenagemot_, of the _Council or Assembly of the\r\nBarons_, and after the reign of Henry III., of the\r\n_Parliament_, a more or less numerous and influential\r\nassembly, composed in a particular manner, was always associated\r\nwith the sovereignty. For a long period, this assembly somewhat\r\nsubserved despotism, and sometimes substituted civil war and\r\nanarchy in the place of despotism; but it always interfered in\r\nthe central government. An independent council, which derived its\r\nstrength from the individual power of its members, was always\r\nadjoined to the royal authority. The English monarchy has always\r\nbeen the government of the king in council, and the king's\r\ncouncil was frequently his adversary. The great council of the\r\nking became the Parliament.\r\n\r\nThis is the only one of the essential characteristics of the\r\nsystem of representative government, which the government of\r\nEngland presents, until the fourteenth century. During the course\r\nof this epoch, the division of power, far from efficiently\r\nrepressing despotism, served only to render it more changeful and\r\nmore dangerous.\r\n{267}\r\nThe council of barons was no more capable than the king himself,\r\nof comprehending and establishing a stable political order and\r\ntrue liberty; these two forces were incessantly in conflict, and\r\ntheir conflict was war, that is to say, the devastation of the\r\ncountry, and the oppression of the mass of the inhabitants. But\r\nfrom this there resulted, in process of time, two decisive facts,\r\nfrom which liberty took its origin; they were these:\r\n\r\n  1. From the very fact that power was divided, it followed that\r\n  absolute power, sovereignty as a right, was never attributed to\r\n  the king, nor supposed to be in itself legitimate. Now, this is\r\n  the very principle of representative government; but this\r\n  principle was far from being understood, or even suspected,\r\n  philosophically speaking. It was incessantly stifled by force,\r\n  or else it was lost in the confusion of the ideas of the time\r\n  regarding divine right, the origin of power, and so forth; but\r\n  it existed in the depths of the public mind, and became by slow\r\n  degrees a fundamental maxim. We find this principle formally\r\n  expressed in the writings of Bracton, Lord Chief Justice under\r\n  Henry III., and of Fortescue, who held the same office under\r\n  Henry VI. \"The king,\" says Bracton, \"should be subject to no\r\n  man, but only to God and to the law, for the law makes him\r\n  king; he can do nothing upon earth but that which, by law, he\r\n  may do; and that which is said in the Pandects, that that which\r\n  pleases the king becomes law, is no objection; for we see by\r\n  the context, that these words do not mean the pure and simple\r\n  will of the prince, but that which has been determined by the\r\n  advice of his councils, the king giving the sanction of his\r\n  authority to their deliberations upon the subject.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n         Character Of The English Monarchy.\r\n\r\n  \"The English monarchy,\" says Fortescue, \"_non solum est\r\n  regalis, sed legalis et politica, potestas,_\" and he\r\n  frequently develops this idea. The limitation of powers was,\r\n  thus, at a very early period, a matter of public right in\r\n  England; and the legitimacy of sole and absolute power was\r\n  never recognized. Thus was established and preserved, for\r\n  better times, the generative principle of all legitimate power\r\n  as well as of all liberty; and by the virtue of this principle\r\n  alone was maintained, in the souls of the people, that noble\r\n  sentiment of right which becomes extinguished and succumbs\r\n  wherever man finds himself in presence of an unlimited\r\n  sovereignty, whatever may be its form and name.\r\n\r\n{268}\r\n\r\n         Importance Of The Towns.\r\n\r\n  2. The division of the supreme power produced yet another\r\n  result. When the towns had acquired greater wealth and\r\n  importance, when there had been formed, beyond the circle of\r\n  the king's immediate vassals, a nation capable of taking part\r\n  in political life, and which the government found it necessary\r\n  to treat with consideration, this nation naturally adjoined\r\n  itself to the great council of the king, which had never ceased\r\n  to exist. In order to gain itself a place in the central\r\n  government, it had no need abruptly to create new institutions;\r\n  a place was already prepared to receive it, and although its\r\n  entrance into the national council ere long changed its nature\r\n  and forms, it at least was not under the necessity of asserting\r\n  and re-animating its existence. There was a fact capable of\r\n  receiving extension, and of admitting into its bosom new facts,\r\n  together with new rights. The British Parliament, to say truth,\r\n  dates only from the formation of the House of Commons; but\r\n  without the presence and importance of the council of Barons,\r\n  the House of Commons would, perhaps, never have been formed.\r\n\r\nThus, on the one hand, the permanence of the idea that the\r\nsovereignty ought to be limited, and, on the other, the actual\r\ndivision of the central power, were the germs of representative\r\ngovernment in England. Until the end of the thirteenth century we\r\nmet with no other of its characteristics; and the English nation,\r\nuntil that period, was not perhaps actually more free and happy\r\nthan any of the peoples of the Continent. But the principle of\r\nthe right of resistance to oppression was already a legal\r\nprinciple in England; and the idea of the supremacy which holds\r\ndominion over all others, of the supremacy of the law, was\r\nalready connected, in the mind of the people and of the\r\njurisconsults themselves, not with any particular person, or with\r\nany particular actual power, but with the name of the law itself.\r\nAlready the law was said to be superior to all other powers;\r\nsovereignty had thus, in principle at least, left that material\r\nworld in which it could not fix itself without engendering\r\ntyranny, to place itself in that moral world, in which actual\r\npowers ought constantly to seek it. Many favourable circumstances\r\nwere doubtless necessary to fecundate these principles of liberty\r\nin England.\r\n\r\n{269}\r\n\r\n         Sources Of Liberty.\r\n\r\nBut when the sentiment of right lives in the souls of men, when\r\nthe citizen meets with no power in his country which he is bound\r\nto consider as infallible and absolutely sovereign, liberty can\r\nnever fail to spring up. It has developed itself in England less\r\nuniversally, less equally, and less reasonably, we venture to\r\nbelieve, than we are permitted to hope will be the case at the\r\npresent day in our own country; but, in fine, it was born, and\r\nincreased in growth in that country more than in any other; and\r\nthe history of its progress, the study of the institutions which\r\nserved as its guarantees, and of the system of government to\r\nwhich its destinies seem henceforward to link themselves, is at\r\nonce a great sight and a necessary work for us. We shall enter\r\nupon it with impartiality, for we can do so without envy.\r\n\r\n{270}\r\n\r\n              Lecture II.\r\n\r\n  Sketch of the History of England, from William the Conqueror to\r\n  John Lackland (1066-1199).\r\n\r\n  William the Conqueror (1066-1087).\r\n\r\n  William Rufus (1087-1100).\r\n\r\n  Henry I.

A knowledge\r\nof facts must always precede the study of institutions.\r\n\r\nThe Britons,--Gauls or Celts in origin,--were the first\r\ninhabitants of Great Britain. Julius Caesar subjugated them, and\r\nthe Roman dominion substituted a false and enervating\r\ncivilization in the place of their barbarian energy. On being\r\nabandoned by Rome, when that city abdicated piecemeal the empire\r\nof the world, the Britons were unable to defend themselves, and\r\nsummoned the Saxons to their assistance. The latter, finding them\r\nalready conquered, from their allies became ere long their\r\nmasters, and exterminated or drove back into the mountains of\r\nWales, the people whom the Romans had subdued. After a long\r\nseries of incursions, the Danes established themselves in the\r\nnorth of England, during the ninth century, and in the latter\r\npart of the eleventh century, the Normans conquered the whole\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n         The Norman Conquest.\r\n\r\nTowards the middle of the eleventh century, and before the Norman\r\nconquest, great enmity still subsisted between the Saxons and the\r\nDanes, whereas between the Danes and Normans the recollections of\r\na common origin were still fresh and vivid.\r\n{271}\r\nEdward the Confessor had been brought up at the Court of\r\nNormandy, and the Normans were held in great favour by him. He\r\nhad appointed several of them to great offices in his realm. The\r\nprimate, the Archbishop of Canterbury, was a Norman; and Norman\r\nwas spoken at the Court of Edward. All these circumstances seemed\r\nto prepare the way for the invasion of England by the Normans.\r\n\r\nThe internal state of England was equally favourable to it. The\r\nSaxon aristocracy had risen in proportion as the royal power had\r\ndeclined; but the power of the great landholders was a divided\r\npower, and their dissensions opened a door for foreign\r\ninterference. Harold, the brother-in-law of king Edward, who had\r\ndied without issue, had just usurped the crown; so that William\r\nhad not even to oppose a legitimate monarch. \"Whether the English\r\nmake Harold or another their duke or king, I grant it,\" said\r\nWilliam on the death of Edward; but he, nevertheless, assumed to\r\nbe heir of the kingdom, by virtue of a will of the deceased\r\nmonarch, and came to assert his right at the head of an army of\r\n40,000 men. On the 14th of October, 1065 [sic; 1066], Harold lost\r\nboth the crown and his life at the battle of Hastings. The\r\nprimate then offered the crown of England to William, who\r\naccepted it after some show of hesitation, and was crowned on the\r\n6th of December. He at first treated his Saxon subjects with\r\nmildness, but ordered the construction of a number of fortresses,\r\nand gave large grants of lands to his Norman comrades. During a\r\njourney which he made into Normandy, in the month of March, 1067,\r\nthe Saxons revolted against the tyranny of the Normans. William\r\nsuppressed the revolt, and continued for some time still faithful\r\nto his policy of conciliation. But rebellions continued to arise,\r\nand William now had recourse to rigorous measures. By repeated\r\nconfiscations he ensured the sovereign establishment of the\r\nNormans, and of the feudal system. The Saxons were excluded from\r\nall great public employments, and particularly from the\r\nbishoprics. William covered England with forts, substituted the\r\nNorman language for the Anglo-Saxon, and made it the language of\r\nlaw--a privilege which subsisted until the reign of Edward III.\r\nHe enacted very severe laws of police, among others the law of\r\ncurfew, so greatly detested by the Saxons, but which already\r\nexisted in Normandy, and finally, he laid waste the county of\r\nYorkshire, the stronghold of the Saxon insurgents.\r\n\r\n{272}\r\n\r\n         Reign Of William Rufus.\r\n\r\nThe Pope had given his approval to William's enterprise, and had\r\nexcommunicated Harold. Nevertheless, William boldly repulsed the\r\npretensions of Gregory VII, and forbade his subjects to recognize\r\nany one as Pope, until he had done so himself. The canons of\r\nevery council were to be submitted to him for his sanction or\r\nrejection. No bull or letter of the Pope might be published\r\nwithout the permission of the king. He protected his ministers\r\nand barons against excommunication. He subjected the clergy to\r\nfeudal military service. And finally, during his reign, the\r\necclesiastical and civil courts, which had previously been\r\ncommingled in the county courts, were separated.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of William, in 1087, his States were divided\r\namong his three sons, Robert, William, and Henry. William Rufus\r\nsucceeded to the throne of England, and Robert to the dukedom of\r\nNormandy. William's reign is remarkable only for acts of tyranny,\r\nfor the extension of the royal forests, and for odious exactions;\r\nhe would not appoint bishops to any of the vacant episcopal sees,\r\nbut appropriated their revenues to his own use, considering them\r\nas fiefs whose possessors were dead.\r\n\r\nWilliam Rufus was almost constantly at war with his brother\r\nRobert. He ended by buying Normandy of him, or, to speak more\r\ncorrectly, he received it in pledge for thirteen thousand silver\r\nmarks which he lent to Robert when about to join the Crusaders.\r\nIn the year 1100, he made a similar bargain with William, Count\r\nof Poitou and Duke of Guienne. The Norman barons bitterly\r\nregretted that Robert was not King of England, as well as Duke of\r\nNormandy. They rebelled several times against William; and\r\nvarious facts indicate that the Saxon nation gained something by\r\nthese revolts, and was rather better treated, in consequence, by\r\nits Norman monarch. But the relations of the two peoples were\r\nstill extremely hostile when William Rufus was killed while\r\nhunting, on the 2nd of August, 1100.\r\n\r\n{273}\r\n         Reign Of Henry I.\r\n\r\nHenry I. usurped the crown of England from his brother Robert, to\r\nwhom it rightfully belonged; and the Norman barons, who preferred\r\nRobert, offered only a feeble resistance to Henry; he was crowned\r\nin London. His first act was a charter, in which, to gain\r\nforgiveness for his usurpation, he promised not to seize upon the\r\nrevenues of the church during the vacancy of benefices; to admit\r\nthe heirs of the crown vassals to the possession of their\r\nestates, without exposing them to such violent exactions as had\r\nbeen usual during the preceding reigns; to moderate the taxes, to\r\npardon the past, and finally to confirm the authority of the laws\r\nof St. Edward, which were so dear to the nation. A short time\r\nafter the concession of this charter, Henry married Matilda, the\r\ndaughter of the King of Scotland, and niece of Edgar Atheling,\r\nthe last heir of the Saxon dynasty; by this marriage he hoped to\r\nconciliate the attachment of the Saxon people. In order to marry\r\nhim, Matilda was liberated from her vows, for she had taken the\r\nveil, not with the intention of becoming a nun, says Eadmer, but\r\nin order to escape from the brutal violence of the Normans.\r\n\r\nIn 1101, Robert returned from the Crusades, and invaded England,\r\nbut a treaty soon put a stop to his progress, and he renounced\r\nhis pretensions on receiving a pension of 3000 marks, and the\r\npromise of succeeding to Henry's inheritance. The bad government\r\nof Robert in Normandy occasioned continual disturbances in that\r\ncountry, and maintained the ever-increasing tendency towards the\r\nunion of Normandy with England. Henry, taking advantage of this\r\nstate of things, invaded Normandy, where he had many powerful\r\nadherents, and after three years of war, in 1106, the battle of\r\nTenchebray decided the fate of Robert, who was taken prisoner and\r\nconfined in Cardiff Castle, where he languished twenty-eight\r\nyears. Normandy was then united to England.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Henry I. was disturbed by continual quarrels with\r\nthe clergy; he was obliged to renounce the right of investiture,\r\nwhich was held to confer spiritual dignity, but the bishops\r\ncontinued to swear to him fidelity and homage, by reason of their\r\ntemporal possessions. In the midst of the obstacles which lay in\r\nhis path, Henry governed with vigour and prudence; he humbled the\r\ngreat barons, restored order, and restrained the clergy; and\r\nthese were the qualities which then constituted a great king. The\r\npretended code which is ascribed to Henry I. is a later\r\ncompilation; but he effected several important reforms, among\r\nothers, by repressing the abuses of the right of purveyance, by\r\nwhich the socage tenants of the king were bound gratuitously to\r\nsupply the court, while journeying, with provisions and\r\ncarriages. It is also said that he substituted, for tenants of\r\nthis class, the payment of a money rent instead of the rent in\r\nkind which they had formerly paid; but it is not probable that\r\nthis was a general rule.\r\n\r\n{274}\r\n\r\n         Wars Of Stephen And Matilda.\r\n\r\nHenry I. died in 1135. His reign promoted, to some extent, the\r\nfusion of the two peoples: but the separation was still wide. His\r\nson William being dead, Henry had appointed as his successor his\r\ndaughter Matilda, the wife of Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of\r\nAnjou; and an assembly of barons had ratified his choice. But,\r\nduring the absence of Matilda, Stephen, Count of Boulogne, the\r\ngrandson of William the Conqueror by his mother Adela, the wife\r\nof Stephen, Count of Blois, usurped the crown of England; but\r\nonly a few barons attended at his coronation, on the 22nd of\r\nDecember, 1135. Stephen was anxious, by making large concessions,\r\nto obtain pardon for his usurpation; and he published two\r\ncharters, which promised all that those issued by Henry had\r\npromised, including the maintenance of the laws of Edward the\r\nConfessor. The clergy and barons, however, swore to him only a\r\nconditional oath; and wishing to make him pay dearly for their\r\nsupport, the church exacted from him the sanction of all its\r\nprivileges, and the barons obtained permission to build\r\nfortresses upon their estates. The kingdom soon bristled with\r\ncastles and ramparts. Eleven hundred and fifteen were erected\r\nduring the reign of Stephen, and assured, far more effectually\r\nthan his charters, the power and independence of the barons.\r\n\r\nIn 1139, an insurrection broke out in favour of Matilda. King\r\nStephen was defeated and made prisoner at the battle of Lincoln,\r\non the 26th of February, 1141. A synod of ecclesiastics, without\r\nthe co-operation of any laymen, gave the crown to Matilda; the\r\ndeputies of the city of London were the only laymen present, and\r\nthey demanded the liberation of King Stephen, but in vain; they\r\nwere admitted into the synod merely to receive orders. A\r\nconspiracy against Matilda overthrew, ere long, the bold work of\r\nthe clergy; Stephen regained his liberty in 1142, and the civil\r\nwar recommenced.\r\n\r\n{275}\r\n\r\n         Reign Of Henry II.\r\n\r\nBut a new enemy had now arisen against him. Prince Henry, the son\r\nof Matilda, though still young, had already rendered himself\r\nremarkable for his bravery and prudence. His mother promised him\r\nthe dukedom of Normandy; the death of his father, Geoffrey\r\nPlantagenet, had given him Maine and Poitou; and his marriage\r\nwith Eleanor of Guienne had gained him two other vast provinces\r\nof France. In 1154, he appeared in England with an army, but a\r\nnegotiation speedily terminated the conflict, and Henry was\r\nacknowledged as the successor of Stephen, who died a year\r\nafterwards, on the 25th of October, 1154.\r\n\r\nA variety of circumstances were favourable to the power of Henry\r\nII. at his accession. He united in his own person the rights of\r\nboth the Saxon and Norman dynasties. He possessed immense\r\ndominions on the Continent; he was Count of Anjou, Duke of\r\nNormandy, Duke of Guienne, Maine, Saintonge, Poitou, Auvergne,\r\nPérigord, Augoumois and Limousin. He married his third son,\r\nGeoffrey, while still a child, to the infant heiress of the duchy\r\nof Brittany. He soon became engaged in war with the nobility and\r\nthe clergy. He revoked all the gifts of the royal domains which\r\nhad been granted by Stephen and Matilda, and regained by arms all\r\nthat was not restored to him peaceably. He demolished a large\r\nnumber of the feudal fortresses. No coalition of the barons had\r\nas yet been formed, and their individual power was utterly unable\r\nto compete with that of Henry; they therefore submitted. The king\r\nalso rallied around him a great number of interests by the\r\nmaintenance of strict order, and by the appointment of itinerant\r\njustices to secure a more equitable administration of the laws.\r\nHis struggle with the clergy was more stormy, and its success\r\nless complete; for the clergy, who were already constituted into\r\na most powerful corporation, and were sustained from without by\r\nthe Holy See, had found within their own body a chieftain capable\r\nof resisting even the greatest monarch. Thomas Becket, born in\r\nLondon in 1119, had advanced so far in the favour of Henry as to\r\nbe appointed his Lord High Chancellor. His services, his\r\ndevotedness, the magnificence of his mode of life, all combined\r\nto persuade Henry that, by elevating Becket to the highest\r\necclesiastical dignities, he would gain a powerful supporter in\r\nthe church; he, therefore, had him appointed Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury and Primate of the kingdom.\r\n\r\n{276}\r\n\r\n          Constitutions Of Clarendon.\r\n\r\nBut no sooner was Becket appointed to this office than he devoted\r\nhimself to the interests of his order, and boldly undertook to\r\nexercise, and even to extend the rights of his position. A clerk\r\nhad committed a murder; Becket punished him according to the laws\r\nof the clergy: Henry desired to have him judged by the civil law;\r\nBecket resisted; and Henry seized this opportunity for attacking\r\nopenly and systematically the ecclesiastical power. He assembled\r\nthe bishops, and inquired of them whether they would submit to\r\nthe ancient laws of the realm, or not; and they were forced to\r\nconsent to do so. The famous Council of Clarendon was convoked in\r\n1164 to define these laws, and fix the limits of the two powers.\r\nThe king had conciliated the support of the lay barons. Sixteen\r\narticles resulted from the deliberations of this assembly; they\r\nare to the following effect:\r\n\r\n  1. All suits concerning the advowson and presentation of\r\n  churches shall be determined in the civil courts.\r\n\r\n  2. Ecclesiastics, when accused of any crime, shall appear\r\n  before the king's justices, who shall determine whether the\r\n  case ought to be tried in the secular or episcopal courts. The\r\n  king's justices shall inquire into the manner in which causes\r\n  of this kind are judged by the ecclesiastical courts; and if\r\n  the clerk is convicted or confesses his crime, he shall lose\r\n  his benefit of clergy.\r\n\r\n  3. No archbishop, bishop, or ecclesiastic of high rank shall\r\n  leave the kingdom without the king's permission. If he should\r\n  go abroad, he must give surety to the king for his return, and\r\n  for his good conduct in all matters affecting the interests of\r\n  the king.\r\n\r\n  4. Excommunicated persons shall not be bound to give security\r\n  for continuing in their present place of abode, but merely for\r\n  presenting themselves to suffer the judgment of the church and\r\n  to receive absolution.\r\n\r\n  5. No tenant in chief of the king, no officer of his household,\r\n  or of his demesnes, shall be excommunicated, or his lands put\r\n  under an interdict, until application has been made to the\r\n  king, or, in his absence, to the grand justiciary, in order to\r\n  obtain justice at his hands.\r\n\r\n  6. All appeals in spiritual causes shall be carried from the\r\n  archdeacon to the bishop, from the bishop to the primate, and\r\n  from him to the king, and shall be carried no further without\r\n  the king's consent.\r\n\r\n{277}\r\n\r\n  7. If any law-suit arise between a layman and an ecclesiastic\r\n  concerning the nature of a fief, the question shall be decided\r\n  by the king's chief justice, by the verdict of twelve _probi\r\n  homines_; and according as the nature of the fief may be\r\n  determined, further proceedings shall be carried on before the\r\n  civil or ecclesiastical courts.\r\n\r\n  8. Any inhabitant of a city, town, borough or manor in the\r\n  king's demesnes, who has been cited before an ecclesiastical\r\n  court to answer for some offence, and who has refused to\r\n  appear, may be placed under an interdict; but no one may be\r\n  excommunicated till the chief officer of the place where he\r\n  resides be consulted, that he may compel him by the civil\r\n  authority to give satisfaction to the church.\r\n\r\n  9. The judgment of all causes, for debts contracted by oath or\r\n  otherwise, is referred to the civil courts.\r\n\r\n  10. When any archbishopric, or bishopric, or abbey, or priory\r\n  of royal foundation is vacant, the king shall enjoy its\r\n  revenues; and when it becomes necessary to fill up a see, the\r\n  king shall summon a chapter to proceed, in the royal chapel, to\r\n  the election, which must obtain the sanction of the king,\r\n  according to the advice of the prelates whom he may have\r\n  thought proper to consult; and the bishop-elect shall swear\r\n  fealty and homage to the king as to his lord, for all his\r\n  temporal possessions, with the exception of the rights of his\r\n  order.\r\n\r\n  11. Churches belonging to the king's fee shall not be granted\r\n  in perpetuity without his consent.\r\n\r\n  12. No layman shall be accused before a bishop, except by legal\r\n  and reputable promoters and witnesses; and if the culprit be of\r\n  such high rank that no one dares to accuse him, the sheriff,\r\n  upon the demand of the bishop, shall appoint twelve lawful men\r\n  of the neighbourhood, who, in presence of the bishop, shall\r\n  pronounce upon the facts of the case, according to their\r\n  conscience.\r\n\r\n  13. Archbishops, bishops, and other spiritual dignitaries who\r\n  are immediate vassals of the king, shall be regarded as barons\r\n  of the realm, and shall possess the privileges and be subjected\r\n  to the burdens belonging to that rank, except in the case of\r\n  condemnation to death or to the loss of a limb.\r\n\r\n  14. That if any person resist a sentence legally pronounced\r\n  upon him by an ecclesiastical court, the king shall employ his\r\n  authority in obliging him to make submission. In like manner,\r\n  if any one throw off his allegiance to the king, the prelates\r\n  shall assist the king with their censures in reducing him.\r\n\r\n{278}\r\n\r\n  15. Goods forfeited to the king shall not be protected in\r\n  churches or churchyards.\r\n\r\n  16. No villein shall be ordained a clerk without the consent of\r\n  the lord on whose estate he was born.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Murder Of Thomas A Becket.\r\n\r\nWhen the constitutions of Clarendon had once been adopted, the\r\nking required that the bishops should affix their seals thereto;\r\nall consented with the exception of Becket, who resisted for a\r\nlong while, but yielded at length, and promised \"legally, with\r\ngood faith, and without fraud or reserve,\" to observe the\r\nconstitutions. The king sent a copy of them to Pope Alexander,\r\nwho approved only the last six articles, and annulled all the\r\nrest. Strong in the support of the Pope, Becket did penance for\r\nhis submission, and renewed the conflict. It soon became\r\ndesperate. The king harassed Becket with persecutions of all\r\nkinds, requiring him to give an account of his administration\r\nwhile Chancellor, and charging him with embezzlement; the bishops\r\nbecame alarmed and deserted the cause of the primate. Becket\r\nresisted with indomitable courage; but he was finally compelled\r\nto fly to the Continent. Henry confiscated all his property, and\r\nbanished all his relatives and servants, to the number of four\r\nhundred. Becket excommunicated the servants of the king, and,\r\nfrom his retirement in a French monastery, made Henry totter on\r\nhis throne. At length, the Pope with his legates, and the King of\r\nFrance, interfered to put an end to this conflict. Henry, who was\r\nembarrassed by a multitude of other affairs, yielded, and Becket\r\nreturned to his see. But his conscience united with his pride to\r\nrekindle the war. He censured the prelates who had failed to\r\nsupport him, and excommunicated some of the king's servants who\r\nhad been active in their persecution of the clergy. \"What!\" cried\r\nHenry, in a transport of passion, \"of the cowards who eat my\r\nbread, is there not one who will free me from this turbulent\r\npriest?\" He was then at Bayeux; four of his gentlemen set out at\r\nonce for Canterbury, and assassinated Becket on the steps of the\r\naltar of his cathedral, on the 29th of December, 1170. The king\r\ndispatched a courier in pursuit of them, but he arrived too late\r\nto prevent the consummation of the deed. Henry manifested the\r\nutmost grief at the death of Becket; we may, however, suppose his\r\nsorrow to have been feigned. In order to avert the consequences,\r\nhe at once sent envoys to Rome to attest his innocence, and the\r\nPope contented himself with fulminating a general excommunication\r\nagainst the authors, fautors, or instigators of the\r\nassassination.\r\n\r\n{279}\r\n\r\n         Conquest Of Ireland.\r\n\r\nOther events, wars with Scotland and France, and an expedition\r\ninto Ireland, diverted the public attention from Becket's death.\r\nIn 1172, Henry resumed his negotiations with Rome, and concluded\r\na treaty which, on the whole, ratified the enactments of the\r\nCouncil of Clarendon. When he had thus become reconciled with the\r\nPope, he made his peace with his subjects, whose enmity he\r\nfeared, by a public penance on the tomb of Becket, who was\r\nhonoured by all England as a martyr.\r\n\r\nIn 1172, some English adventurers conquered without difficulty,\r\nand almost without a battle, a part of Ireland. Henry led an\r\nexpedition into that country, and his authority was recognized.\r\nThe remainder of his life was agitated by continual wars in\r\ndefence of his possessions on the Continent, and by the\r\nrebellions of his children, who were anxious to divide his power\r\nand dominions before his death. He died of grief at their conduct\r\non the 6th of July, 1189, at Chinon, near Saumur; and the corpse\r\nof one of the greatest kings of England and of his age was left\r\nfor some time, deserted and stripped, upon the steps of an altar.\r\nHis eldest son, Richard Cœur-de-Lion, succeeded him without\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Richard Cœur-de-lion.\r\n\r\nIn every age, and at every great epoch of history, we almost\r\ninvariably witness the appearance of some individuals who seem to\r\nbe the types of the general spirit and dominant dispositions of\r\ntheir time. Richard, the adventurer-king, is an exact\r\nrepresentation of the chivalrous spirit of the feudal system and\r\nof the twelfth century. Immediately upon his accession, his only\r\nthought was the accumulation of money for the Crusades; he\r\nalienated his domains; he publicly sold offices, honours, and\r\neven the loftiest dignities, to the highest bidder; he even sold\r\npermissions not to go on the Crusade; and he was ready to sell\r\nLondon, he said, if he could find a purchaser. And while he was\r\nsacrificing everything to his passion for pious adventures, his\r\npeople massacred the Jews because some of them had appeared at\r\nthe coronation of the king, notwithstanding the prohibition.\r\n\r\n{280}\r\n\r\nRichard set out at length for the Crusades, leaving as Regent\r\nduring his absence his mother Eleanor, who had excited the\r\nprinces her sons to rebellion against the king their father; and\r\nhe associated the Bishops of Durham and Ely with her in the\r\nregency. The tyranny of the Bishop of Ely spread confusion\r\nthroughout England; he placed his colleague under arrest, and\r\ngoverned alone with boundless arrogance, until at last Prince\r\nJohn had him deposed by a council of barons and prelates.\r\nRichard, on his return from the Crusades, was, as is well known,\r\ndetained prisoner in Austria, from the 20th of December, 1193, to\r\nthe 4th of February, 1194, when he recovered his liberty by the\r\ndevotedness of one of his vassals. The power of feudal feelings\r\nand ties was also manifested in the eagerness of his subjects to\r\npay his ransom. Richard, when restored to his kingdom, spent the\r\nremainder of his life in continual wars in France, and died, on\r\nthe 6th of April, 1199, of a wound received at the siege of the\r\ncastle of Chalus, near Limoges, while endeavouring to gain\r\npossession of a treasure which, it was said, the Count of Limoges\r\nhad found.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Richard, the liberties of the towns and\r\nboroughs, which had commenced under William Rufus, made\r\nconsiderable progress, and prepared the way for that decisive\r\nadvance of national liberties and representative government in\r\nEngland--the Great Charter of King John.\r\n\r\n{281}\r\n              Lecture III.\r\n\r\n  Anglo-Saxon institutions.\r\n\r\n  Effects of the Norman Conquest upon Anglo-Saxon institutions.\r\n\r\n  Effects of the Conquest upon Norman institutions.\r\n\r\n  Causes which made the Norman Conquest favourable to the\r\n  establishment of a system of free institutions in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Effects Of The Norman Conquest.\r\n\r\nAfter having given a summary, in the preceding lecture, of the\r\nprincipal historical facts, we are now about to survey\r\nAnglo-Norman institutions during the period to which we have just\r\nturned our attention, namely, from the middle of the eleventh\r\ncentury until the end of the twelfth.\r\n\r\nHow came it that free institutions were established from this\r\ntime forth among this people, and not in other countries? The\r\nanswer to this question may be found in the general facts of\r\nEnglish history, for institutions are much more the work of\r\ncircumstances than of the texts of laws.\r\n\r\nThe States which were founded in Europe, from the fifth to the\r\nseventh century, were established by hordes of wandering\r\nBarbarians, the conquerors of the degraded Roman population. On\r\nthe side of the victors, there existed no fixed and determinate\r\nform of social life; on the side of the vanquished, forms and\r\ninstitutions crumbled into dust; social life died of inanition.\r\nHence arose long disorders, ignorance and impossibility of a\r\ngeneral system of organization, the reign of force, and the\r\ndismemberment of sovereignty.\r\n\r\nNothing of the kind occurred in England in the eleventh century,\r\nin consequence of the Norman Conquest. A Barbarian people which\r\nhad already been established in a country for two hundred years\r\nconquered another Barbarian people which had been territorially\r\nestablished for six hundred years. For this reason, many decisive\r\ndifferences may be observed between this conquest and those which\r\ntook place on the Continent.\r\n\r\n{282}\r\n         Resemblance Of The Two Peoples.\r\n\r\n  1. There was much more resemblance, and consequently much more\r\n  equality, between the two peoples; their origin was the same,\r\n  their manners and language were analogous, their civilization\r\n  was almost identical, and the warlike spirit was as powerful\r\n  among the vanquished as among the victors. Thus, two nations\r\n  under almost similar conditions, found themselves in presence\r\n  of one another, and the conquered nation was able, as well as\r\n  disposed, to defend its liberties. Hence arose many individual\r\n  evils, but no general and permanent abasement of one race\r\n  before the other. Oppressed at first, but retaining its warlike\r\n  character, the Saxon race offered an energetic resistance, and\r\n  gradually raised itself from its inferior position.\r\n\r\n  2. The two peoples also possessed political institutions of a\r\n  singularly analogous nature, whereas elsewhere, in France and\r\n  in Italy, the Roman populations, to speak the truth, possessed\r\n  no institutions at all. The communes and the clergy were\r\n  required to maintain, even obscurely, the Roman law among\r\n  societies on the Continent; whereas in England, Saxon\r\n  institutions were never stifled by Norman institutions, but\r\n  associated with them, and finally even changed their character.\r\n  On the Continent, we behold the successful sway of barbarism,\r\n  feudalism, and absolute power, derived either from Roman or\r\n  ecclesiastical ideas. In England, absolute power was never able\r\n  to obtain a footing; oppression was frequently practised in\r\n  fact, but it was never established by law.\r\n\r\n  3. The two peoples professed the same religion; one had not to\r\n  convert the other. On the Continent, the more Barbarian victor\r\n  adopted the religion of the vanquished, and the clergy were\r\n  almost entirely Romans; in England, they were both Saxons and\r\n  Normans. Hence resulted an important fact. The English clergy,\r\n  instead of enrolling themselves in the retinue of the kings,\r\n  naturally assumed a place among the landed aristocracy, and in\r\n  the nation. Thus the political order has almost constantly\r\n  predominated in England over the religious order; and ever\r\n  since the Norman Conquest, the political power of the clergy,\r\n  always called in question, has always been on the decline.\r\n\r\n{283}\r\n\r\n         Sources Of The English Government.\r\n\r\nThis is the decisive circumstance in the history of England--the\r\ncircumstance which has caused its civilization to take an\r\naltogether different course to that taken by the civilization of\r\nthe Continent. Of necessity, and at an early period, a compromise\r\nand amalgamation took place between the victors and the\r\nvanquished, both of whom had institutions to bring into common\r\nuse; institutions more analogous than existed anywhere\r\nelse--stronger and more fully developed, because they belonged to\r\npeoples which had already been territorially established for a\r\nconsiderable time.\r\n\r\nThus, Saxon institutions and Norman institutions are the two\r\nsources of the English government. The English commonly refer\r\ntheir political liberties to the former source; they see that, on\r\nthe Continent, feudalism did not produce liberty; and they\r\nattribute their feudalism to the Normans, and their liberty to\r\nthe Saxons. This distinction has even become a symbol of modern\r\npolitical parties; the Tories, in general, affect a neglect of\r\nSaxon institutions, whilst the Whigs attach to them the greatest\r\nimportance. This view of events appears to me to be neither exact\r\nnor complete. Saxon institutions were not, by themselves, the\r\nprinciple of English liberties. The forced assimilation of the\r\ntwo peoples and of the two systems of institutions, was their\r\ntrue cause. There is even room for doubt whether, without the\r\nConquest, liberty would have resulted from Saxon institutions;\r\nand we may believe that they would have produced in England\r\nresults analogous to those which occurred on the Continent. The\r\nConquest inspired them with new virtue, and caused them to\r\nproduce results which, if they had been left to themselves, they\r\nwould not have produced. Political liberty issued from them, but\r\nwas begotten by the influence of the Conquest, and in consequence\r\nof the position in which the Conquest placed the two peoples and\r\ntheir laws.\r\n\r\nI will now recall to your recollection Anglo-Saxon institutions\r\nas they existed before the Conquest; and you will soon see that\r\nit was the forced approximation of the two peoples which gave\r\nthem vitality, and brought forth the liberties of England.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Anglo-Saxon Institutions.\r\n\r\nAmong local institutions, some were based upon common\r\ndeliberation, and others upon hierarchical subordination; that is\r\nto say, some upon a principle of liberty, and others upon a\r\nprinciple of dependence. On one side, were the courts of hundred\r\nand the county-courts; on the other, the great landowners and\r\ntheir vassals: every man of fourteen years old and upwards was\r\nobliged to belong either to a hundred or to a lord, that is, to\r\nbe free or vassal.\r\n{284}\r\nThese two hostile systems, then, placed in presence of one\r\nanother, conflicted as upon the Continent. There is some doubt\r\nabout the question whether, before the Conquest, feudalism\r\nexisted with regard to lands: that it existed with regard to\r\npersons there can be no doubt, for their hierarchical\r\nclassification was real and progressive. In localities, although\r\nthe system of free institutions subsisted, the system of feudal\r\ninstitutions was gaining ground; seignorial jurisdictions were\r\nencroaching upon free jurisdictions; and almost the same process,\r\nin fact, was going on as upon the Continent.\r\n\r\nIf we look at central institutions, we observe the same\r\nphenomenon. On the Continent, feudalism was produced by the\r\naggrandizement of the king's vassals, and by the dislocation of\r\nthe sovereignty. The national unity, which resided in the\r\nassembly of the nation, became dissolved; the monarchical unity\r\nwas unable to resist; and monarchy and liberty perished together.\r\nEvents had taken the same course among the Anglo-Saxons. Under\r\nEdward the Confessor, the decay of the royal authority is\r\nevident. Earl Godwin, Siward, Duke of Northumberland, Leofric,\r\nDuke of Mercia, and many other great vassals, are rivals rather\r\nthan subjects of the king; and Harold usurping the crown from\r\nEdgar Atheling, the legitimate heir, bears a strong resemblance\r\nto Hugh Capet. The sovereignty tends to dismemberment.\r\nMonarchical unity is in danger; national unity is in the same\r\ndeclining state, as is proved by the history of the Wittenagemot.\r\nThis general assembly of the nation was at first the assembly of\r\nthe warriors; afterwards the general assembly of the land-owners,\r\nboth great and small; and at a later period, the assembly of the\r\ngreat land-owners alone, or of the king's thanes. Even these at\r\nlast neglect to attend its meetings; and isolate themselves upon\r\ntheir estates, in which each of them exercises his share of the\r\ndismembered sovereignty. This is almost identical with the course\r\nof affairs on the Continent. Only, the system of free\r\ninstitutions still subsists in England with some energy in local\r\ninstitutions, and especially in the county-courts. The feudal\r\nsystem is in a less advanced state than on the Continent.\r\n\r\n{285}\r\n\r\n         Norman Institutions.\r\n\r\nWhat would have happened if the Conquest had not occurred? It is\r\nimpossible to say with certainty, but probably just what happened\r\non the Continent. The same symptoms are manifested, the decay of\r\nthe royal authority and of the national assembly; and the\r\nformation of a hierarchical landed aristocracy, almost entirely\r\nindependent of the central power, and exercising almost\r\nundisputed sovereignty in its domains, excepting only feudal\r\nliberties.\r\n\r\nWhile Anglo-Saxon institutions were in this state, the Normans\r\nconquered England. What new elements did they introduce, and what\r\neffect did the Conquest produce upon the Saxons?\r\n\r\nThe feudal system was completely established in Normandy; the\r\nrelations of the duke with his vassals, the general council of\r\nthe barons, the seignorial administration, of justice, the\r\nsuperior courts of the duke, were all organized already. This\r\nsystem is impracticable in a large State, especially when manners\r\nhave made but little progress; it leads to the dislocation of the\r\nState and of the sovereignty, and to a federation of powerful\r\nindividuals, who dismember the royal power. But in a State of\r\nlimited extent, like Normandy, the feudal system may subsist\r\nwithout destroying unity; and notwithstanding William's continual\r\nwars with some of his vassals, he was in very reality the\r\npowerful chieftain of his feudal aristocracy. The proof of this\r\nis contained in the very enter prize upon which he led them. He\r\nhad, say the chronicles, from forty to sixty thousand men, of\r\nwhom twenty-five thousand were hired adventurers or men who\r\njoined his standard in the hope of obtaining booty. He was not a\r\nleader of Barbarians, but a sovereign undertaking an invasion at\r\nthe head of his barons.\r\n\r\nAfter the Conquest and their territorial establishment, the bonds\r\nwhich united the Norman aristocracy were necessarily drawn still\r\ncloser together. Encamped in the midst of a people who regarded\r\nthem with hostility and were capable of vigorous resistance, the\r\nconquerors felt the need of unity; so they linked themselves\r\ntogether, and fortified the central power. On the Continent,\r\nafter the Barbarian invasions, we hear of hardly any\r\ninsurrections of the original inhabitants: the wars and conflicts\r\nare between the conquerors themselves; but in England they are\r\nbetween the conquerors and the conquered people. We indeed meet,\r\nfrom time to time, with revolts of the Norman barons against the\r\nking; but these two powers generally acted in concert, for their\r\ninterest was their bond of union.\r\n{286}\r\nMoreover, William had found a royal domain of large extent,\r\nalready in existence: and it received immense increase from\r\nconfiscations of the lands of Anglo-Saxon rebels. Although the\r\nspoliation was not universal, it was carried out with unexampled\r\npromptitude and regularity. William soon had 600 direct vassals,\r\nnearly all of whom were Normans, and his landed property was\r\ndivided into 60,215 knight's fees, a large quantity of which\r\nfrequently belonged to the same master; for example, Robert de\r\nMortaigne alone possessed 973 manors, the Earl of Warrenne 278,\r\nand Roger Bigod 123; but they were all scattered through\r\ndifferent counties, for though the prudent William was willing to\r\nmake his vassals rich, he was not desirous of making them too\r\npowerful.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Cohesion Of The Norman Aristocracy.\r\n\r\nAnother proof of the cohesion of the Norman aristocracy is\r\nsupplied by the Doomsday Book; a statistical account of the royal\r\nfiefs, and register of the demesne lands and direct vassals of\r\nthe king, which was begun in 1081 and terminated in 1086: it was\r\ncompiled by royal commissioners. King Alfred had also directed\r\nthe compilation of a similar register, but it has been lost.\r\nNothing of the kind was ever done in any other country.\r\n\r\nThe same cause which rendered Norman feudalism in England more\r\ncompact and regular than on the Continent, produced a\r\ncorresponding effect upon the Saxons. Oppressed by a powerful and\r\nthoroughly united enemy, they formed in serried ranks,\r\nconstituted themselves into a national body, and clung resolutely\r\nto their ancient laws. And in the first instance, the\r\nestablishment of William did not appear to have been entirely the\r\nwork of force; there were even some forms of election; after the\r\nbattle of Hastings, the crown was offered to him by the Saxons,\r\nand at his coronation at Westminster, he swore to govern the\r\nSaxons and Normans by equal laws. After this period, we\r\nincessantly find the Saxons claiming to be ruled by the laws of\r\nEdward the Confessor, that is to say, by the Saxon laws, and they\r\nobtained this right from all the Norman kings in succession.\r\nThese laws thus became their rallying point, their primitive and\r\npermanent code. The county-courts, which continued to exist, also\r\nserved to maintain the Saxon liberties.\r\n{287}\r\nFeudal jurisdiction had made but little progress among the\r\nSaxons; it received extension on the arrival of the Normans; but\r\nit had no time to strike deep root, for it found itself limited\r\non the one hand by the county-courts, and on the other by the\r\nroyal jurisdiction. On the Continent, the royal authority\r\nconquered judicial power from feudalism; in England, the royal\r\nauthority was superimposed upon the county-courts. Hence arises\r\nthe immense difference between the two judicial systems.\r\n\r\nLastly, the Saxons still possessed landed property, which they\r\ndefended or claimed in reliance upon titles anterior to the\r\nConquest, and the validity of these titles was recognised.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Results Of The Norman Conquest.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the whole matter, the Norman Conquest did not destroy\r\nright among the Saxons, either in political or civil order. It\r\nopposed in both nations that tendency to isolation, to the\r\ndissolution of society and of power, which was the general course\r\nof things in Europe. It bound the Normans to one another, and\r\nunited the Saxons among themselves; it brought them into presence\r\nof each other with mutual powers and rights, and thus effected,\r\nin a certain measure, an amalgamation of the two nations and of\r\nthe two systems of institutions, under the sway of a strong\r\ncentral power. The Saxons retained their manners as well as their\r\nlaws; their interests were for a long time interests of liberty,\r\nand they were able to defend them. This position, far more than\r\nthe intrinsic character of Saxon institutions, led to the\r\npredominance of a system of free government in England.\r\n\r\n{288}\r\n\r\n              Lecture IV.\r\n\r\n  The English Parliament in the earliest times of the\r\n  Anglo-Norman Monarchy.\r\n\r\n  Different names given to the King's Great Council.\r\n\r\n  Its characteristics.\r\n\r\n  Its constitution.\r\n\r\n  Opinions of Whigs and Tories on this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         Powers Which Rule Society.\r\n\r\nYou have already seen what was the influence of the Norman\r\nConquest on the political destinies of England; and what was the\r\nposition in which the two peoples were placed by it. They did not\r\nunite, nor did they mutually destroy one another. They lived in a\r\nstate of national and political conflict, the one people being\r\ninvested with a large power of government, while the other was\r\nfar from being destitute of the means of resistance. We have now\r\nto enquire what were those institutions upon which this struggle\r\nwas founded. We shall not concern ourselves with all the\r\ninstitutions which then existed in society: we are now looking\r\nfor the sources of representative government, and are therefore\r\nat present only interested in those in which the germs of a\r\nrepresentative system existed.\r\n\r\n\r\n          Division Of Powers In England.\r\n\r\nIn order to determine with some precision the object of our\r\nstudy, it will be necessary to form some idea of the different\r\nfunctions of the power which is applied to the government of\r\nsociety. In the foremost rank is presented the legislative power,\r\nwhich imposes rules and obligations on the entire mass of society\r\nand on the executive power itself. Next appears the executive\r\npower, which takes the daily oversight of the general business of\r\nsociety--war, peace, raising of men and of taxes. Then the\r\njudicial power, which adjusts matters of private interest\r\naccording to laws previously established. Lastly, the\r\nadministrative power, charged, under its own responsibility, with\r\nthe duty of regulating matters which cannot be anticipated and\r\nprovided for by any general laws.\r\n\r\n{289}\r\n\r\nDuring three centuries these powers have tended to centralization\r\nin France; so much so, that if we would study the government of\r\nthe country we must attend to them all, for they were all united\r\nand limited to the same individuals. Richelieu, Louis XIV, the\r\nRevolution, Napoleon, though in different positions, seem to have\r\ninherited the same projects and moved in the same direction. Such\r\nhas not been the case in England. The administrative power there,\r\nfor example, is to the present time divided and subdivided; it\r\nbelongs either to those who are themselves interested in its\r\nmovements, or to local magistrates, independent of the central\r\npower of the State, and forming no corporation among themselves.\r\nThe judicial power itself is divided. It was so to some extent,\r\nthrough another and stronger cause, in the earlier times of\r\nEngland's social life, as in all societies which have made but\r\nsmall advancement. Different powers are then not only distributed\r\nbut commingled. The legislative power is no more central than\r\nothers: its functions are continually usurped by local powers.\r\nJudicial power is almost entirely local. Centralization commences\r\nwith the executive power properly so called, and this for a long\r\ntime remains the only one in which any centralizing tendency is\r\nfound. The proof of this is furnished by the feudal system, when\r\nalmost all powers--those connected with justice, militia, taxes,\r\n&c.--were local, although the feudal hierarchy had at its head\r\nthe king, and the assembly of the most important possessors of\r\nfiefs.\r\n\r\nIn this distribution and confusion of powers at the period we are\r\nconsidering, the institutions which we have especially to study\r\nin order to find the origin of representative government, are\r\nthose which were central, that is to say, the Parliament and the\r\nking. On the Continent, centralization has resulted from an\r\nabsolute power which has broken up and absorbed all local powers.\r\nIn England, on the other hand, local powers have subsisted after\r\na thousand vicissitudes, while they have increasingly regulated\r\nand defined their own action. A central government has emanated\r\nfrom them by degrees--it has progressively formed and extended\r\nitself. We shall trace this formation step by step, and shall\r\nonly study local institutions as they relate to this one fact;\r\nand we shall see that this circumstance has been the principal\r\ncause of the establishment of a free government in England.\r\n\r\n{290}\r\n\r\n         The Anglo-Norman Parliament.\r\n\r\nIt is easily presumed that, in such a state of society, no other\r\ncentral institution, properly so called, existed for a long time,\r\nexcept royalty. There are certain maxims, certain habits of\r\ncentral political action, but no constant rule: the facts are\r\nvaried and contradictory. Men of considerable influence, almost\r\nsovereigns in their own domains, are much less desirous of any\r\nparticipation in the central power; they rather attempt to defend\r\nthemselves from it as often as it infringes upon their interests,\r\nthan endeavour at all to control it beforehand, and to act upon\r\nit in a general manner. As in France, at the end of the\r\nCarlovingian dynasty, a king can hardly be met with, so in\r\nEngland, under the first Norman kings, a Parliament can hardly be\r\nfound. That which existed bearing any resemblance to one differs\r\nbut little from the Saxon Wittenagemot in the form which belonged\r\nto it immediately before the Conquest, or from the Council of\r\nBarons in Normandy. We find in the works of historians, and in\r\ncharters, the following names: _Curia de more, Curia regis,\r\nConcilium, Magnum Concilium, Commune Concilium, Concilium\r\nregni_. But these are to be regarded only as vague expressions\r\nwhich designate assemblies, without giving any clue by which to\r\ndetermine their constitution and their power. Hale sees in them\r\n\"a Parliament as complete and as real as has ever been held in\r\nEngland.\" Carte and Brady see in them only tribunals, privy\r\ncouncils dependent upon the king, or pompous gatherings for the\r\ncelebration of certain solemnities. It will be better for us to\r\nexamine each of these words, and seek for the actual facts which\r\ncorrespond to them in the period to which our attention is\r\ndirected.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Tories in general, the words _Curia de more,\r\n_or _Concilium, Curia regis, Magnum_ or Commune\r\nConcilium, represent different assemblies. _Concilium_ is a\r\nprivy council composed of men chosen by the king to serve him in\r\nthe government. This _Concilium_ was at the same time\r\n_Curia regis_, a tribunal to judge of matters brought before\r\nthe king, and presided over by him, or, in his absence, by the\r\nchief justice. It was called also _Curia de more_, because\r\nits assemblies were held, according to ancient usage, three times\r\nin the course of the year, at Easter, Whitsuntide, and Christmas,\r\nand was even adjourned regularly from one period to another, as\r\nis done to the present day by the Courts at Westminster.\r\n\r\n{291}\r\n\r\nAccording to the Whigs, all these words originally designated,\r\nand continued to the reign of Henry II. (1154-1189) to designate\r\nthe general assembly of the nobles of the kingdom, who\r\nnecessarily assembled before the king in order to try cases, to\r\nmake laws, and to give their concurrence to the government.\r\n\r\nThe first of these opinions puts too great a restraint upon the\r\nmeaning of the words; the second generalizes too much on isolated\r\nfacts, and assigns to them an importance which does not belong to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n         The Curia De More.\r\n\r\n_Curia de more, Curia regis_, signified originally neither\r\nthe merely privy council of the king nor his tribunal; it was\r\nevidently a grand assembly at which all the nobles of the kingdom\r\nwere present, either to treat of the affairs of State, or to\r\nassist the king in the administration of justice. \"The king,\"\r\nsays the Saxon Chronicle, \"was wont to wear his crown three times\r\na year--at Easter in Winchester; at Whitsuntide in Westminster;\r\nat Christmas in Gloucester; and then there were present with him\r\nall the great men of all England, archbishops and bishops, abbots\r\nand counts, thanes and knights.\"--\"A royal edict,\" says William\r\nof Malmesbury, \"called to the _Curia de more_ all the nobles\r\nof every grade, in order that those sent from foreign countries\r\nmight be struck with the magnificence of the company, and with\r\nthe splendour of the festivities.\"--\"Under William Rufus,\" says\r\nEadmer, \"all the nobles of the kingdom came, according to usage,\r\nto the king's court, on the day of our Saviour's nativity.\"\r\nAnselm, Archbishop of Canterbury, having presented himself _ad\r\nCuriam pro more_, \"was received with joy by the king and all\r\nthe nobility of the kingdom.\" In 1109, at Christmas, \"the kingdom\r\nof England assembled at London, at the court of the king,\r\naccording to custom.\"\r\n\r\n{292}\r\n         The Curia Regis.\r\n\r\n_Curia regis_ designates generally the place of the king's\r\nresidence, and by an extension of meaning the assembly held in\r\nthat place; this assembly was general, and not a mere gathering\r\nof permanent judges. William I., summoning the Dukes of Norfolk\r\nand Hereford to attend and receive judgment _in Curia\r\nregis_, \"convoked,\" says Ordericus Vitalis, \"all the nobility\r\nto his court.\" Several judicial assemblies held under William\r\nRufus, are called _ferme totius regni nobilitas, totius regni\r\nadunatio_. Facts and expressions of the same kind are to be\r\nfound in documents of the time of Stephen. Even under Henry II.,\r\nwhen the Court of King's Bench had already become a distinct\r\ntribunal, the expression _Curia regis_ is applied to the\r\ngeneral assembly collected for the transaction of public\r\nbusiness. Henry convoked his _Curia_ at Bermondsey, _cum\r\nprincipibus suis de statû regni et pace reformandâ tractans_.\r\nThe second of the Constitutions of Clarendon orders all the\r\nimmediate vassals of the crown _interesse judiciis curiæ\r\nregis_. The great Council of Northampton, which passed\r\njudgment in the complaints of the crown against Becket, is called\r\n_Curia regis_; it comprised not only the bishops, counts and\r\nbarons, but besides these, the sheriffs and the barons _secundæ\r\ndignitatis_. Lastly, under Richard I., the general assembly of\r\nthe nobles of the kingdom is still called _Curia regis_ in\r\nthe trial of the Archbishop of York: \"On this occasion there were\r\npresent the Earl of Morton and almost all the bishops, earls and\r\nbarons of the kingdom.\"\r\n\r\nA little consideration will show us the inferences to be drawn\r\nfrom all these facts. At this period the legislative and judicial\r\npowers were not separated; both of them belonged to the assembly\r\nof the nobles, as they had previously belonged to the\r\nWittenagemot of the Saxons. When deliberations with reference to\r\na subject or personage of importance were required, this was the\r\nassembly that judged, as it interposed on all great occasions in\r\nthe government. Thus all these different expressions denote\r\noriginally the same assembly, composed of the nobles of the\r\nkingdom who were called to bear their share in the government.\r\n\r\nHow did they interpose? What power, what functions belonged to\r\nthem?--these are questions which were futile at that time: for no\r\none then had determinate functions, but everything was decided\r\naccording to fact and necessity. The facts are these: \"It was the\r\nancient usage that the nobles of England should at Christmas time\r\nmeet at the king's court, either to celebrate the festival, or to\r\npay their respects to the king, or to deliberate concerning the\r\naffairs of the kingdom.\"\r\n{293}\r\nWe find that these assemblies were occupied in legislation, in\r\necclesiastical affairs, in questions of peace and war, in\r\nextraordinary taxes, in the succession of the crown, in the\r\ndomestic affairs of the king, his marriage, the nuptials of his\r\nchildren, dissensions in the royal family, in one word, in all\r\nmatters of government, says Florence of Worcester, whenever the\r\nking did not feel himself strong enough to settle them without\r\nthe assistance of the general assembly, or when the mode in which\r\nhe had settled them had excited complaints in sufficient number\r\nto admonish him of the necessity of taking the advice of others.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Tenure Of These Assemblies.\r\n\r\nAs to the holding of these assemblies, they were not regular: the\r\nWhigs have attached too much importance to the three periods\r\nmentioned as the times of their annual convocation: these\r\ngatherings were rather of the nature of solemnities, or\r\nfestivals, than public assemblies. The king at that time\r\nconsidered it very important that he should exhibit himself\r\nsurrounded by numerous and wealthy vassals, _species\r\nmultitudinis;_ his force and dignity were thereby displayed,\r\njust as that of every baron was exhibited in his own dominions.\r\nBesides, under Henry II. and Stephen, these three epochs ceased\r\nto be regularly observed. The Tories, on the other hand, not\r\nconsidering the gatherings called _Curiæ de more_ and\r\n_Curiæ regis_ as political assemblies, have represented them\r\nas extremely infrequent, which they were not; there is not a\r\nsingle reign, from the Conquest to the times of King John, in\r\nwhich several instances of them are not to be found; only there\r\nwas nothing settled and fixed in this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n          Constitution Of These Assemblies.\r\n\r\nThe question of the constitution of these assemblies remains.\r\nHistorians and charters say nothing definite on this point: they\r\nspeak of their members as _magnates, proceres, barones_,\r\nsometimes as_milites, servientes, liberi homines_. There is\r\nevery reason to suppose that the feudal principle was here\r\napplied, and that, as a matter of right, all the immediate\r\nvassals of the king owed to him service at court as well as in\r\nwar. On the other hand, the number of the vassals attached to the\r\ncrown under William I. exceeded 600; and there is no reason for\r\nbelieving that all these would present themselves at the\r\nassembly, nor are there any facts to indicate that they did so.\r\nIt had already become, for the most part, rather an onerous\r\nservice than a right; accordingly they only presented themselves\r\nin small numbers.\r\n\r\n{294}\r\n\r\nThe word most frequently employed is _barones:_ it would\r\nappear to have been originally applied to all the direct vassals\r\nof the crown, _per servitium militare_, by knightly service;\r\nwe find that the use of the word was limited more and more till\r\nit was applied almost exclusively to those vassals of the crown\r\nwho were sufficiently wealthy and large proprietors to have a\r\ncourt of justice established in the seat of their barony. It is\r\neven difficult to admit that this last principle was generally\r\nfollowed. The name of _barones_ was finally applied only to\r\nthose immediate vassals who were so powerful that the king felt\r\nhimself obliged to convoke them. There was no primitive and\r\nconstant rule to distinguish the barons from other vassals; but a\r\nclass of vassals was gradually formed who were more rich, more\r\nimportant, more habitually occupied with the king in affairs of\r\nstate, and who came at last to arrogate to themselves exclusively\r\nthe title of barons.\r\n\r\nThe bishops and abbots also formed part of these assemblies, both\r\nas being heads of the clergy, and as immediate vassals of the\r\nking or of the barons.\r\n\r\nNo trace of election or of representation is to be found, either\r\non the part of the king's vassals who did not present themselves\r\nat the assembly, or on the part of the towns. These last had in\r\ngeneral suffered very greatly by the Norman Conquest. In York the\r\nnumber of houses was reduced from 1607 to 967; in Oxford from 721\r\nto 243: in Derby from 243 to 140; in Chester from 487 to 282.\r\n\r\nThese, then, are the essential facts which we may gather with\r\nreference to the constitution and power of the King's Court, or\r\ngeneral assembly of the nobles of the nation. We see how little\r\ninfluence must have been exerted by an assembly of so irregular a\r\ncharacter; and we shall see this still more strikingly\r\nillustrated when we have brought it into comparison with the\r\nrights, the revenues, and all the powers which were at that time\r\nenjoyed by royalty.\r\n\r\n{295}\r\n\r\n              Lecture V.\r\n\r\n  The Anglo-Norman royalty: its wealth and power.\r\n\r\n  Comparison of the relative forces of the Crown and of the\r\n  feudal aristocracy.\r\n\r\n  Progress of the royal power.\r\n\r\n  Spirit of association and resistance among the great barons.\r\n\r\n  Commencement of the struggle between these two political forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Wealth Of The King.\r\n\r\nIn order to judge accurately of the power and importance of\r\nroyalty at the period we are considering, we must first ascertain\r\nits actual position and resources; and we shall see by the extent\r\nof these resources, and by the advantages of this position, how\r\nfeeble in its action on the royal power must have been the\r\ninfluence of the assembly of barons.\r\n\r\nThe riches of the Norman king were independent of his subjects;\r\nhe possessed an immense quantity of domains, 1,462 manors, and\r\nthe principal towns of the kingdom. These domains were\r\ncontinually being augmented, either by confiscations, causes for\r\nwhich were of frequent occurrence, or by the failure of lawful\r\nheirs. The king gave lands on a free tenure to those cultivators\r\nwho would pay for them a determinate rent (_free socage\r\ntenure_). This was the origin of most of the freeholders,\r\nwhether in the king's domains or in those of his barons. The\r\nking, in his domains, imposed taxes at will; he also arbitrarily\r\nimposed custom-house regulations on the importation and\r\nexportation of merchandize; and he fixed the amount of fines and\r\nof the redemption money for crimes. He sold public offices, among\r\nothers that of sheriff, which was a lucrative one on account of\r\nthe share in fines which belonged to it. The county sometimes\r\nwould pay for the right to nominate its sheriff, or to avoid a\r\nnomination already made. Lastly, the sale of royal protection and\r\njustice was a source of considerable revenue.\r\n\r\n{296}\r\n         Duties Of The Royal Vassals.\r\n\r\nAs to the immediate vassals of the king, they owed him,\r\n\r\n  _First_, a military service of forty days whenever it was\r\n  required;\r\n\r\n  _Secondly_, pecuniary aid under three circumstances,--to\r\n  ransom the king when made prisoner, to arm his eldest son as a\r\n  knight, or to marry his eldest daughter. The amount of this aid\r\n  was undetermined up to the reign of Edward I.; it was then\r\n  fixed at twenty shillings for the fief of a knight, and as much\r\n  for every twenty pounds sterling value in land held in socage\r\n  tenure.\r\n\r\n  _Thirdly_, the king had a right to receive from his\r\n  vassals a relief or fine on the death of the possessor of a\r\n  fief; he was guardian if the heir were a minor, and enjoyed all\r\n  the revenues of the fief till the majority of the heir; he also\r\n  had a control over their marriages, that is to say, the vassal\r\n  of a king could not marry without his consent. All these rights\r\n  were indeterminate, and negotiations were substituted for them\r\n  in which the greater force always had the advantage.\r\n\r\n  _Fourthly_, the dispensation from feudal military service\r\n  gave rise to an impost termed _escuage_, a kind of\r\n  ransom-money fixed arbitrarily by the king, as representative\r\n  of a service to which he had a claim; and he even imposed it in\r\n  many cases on his vassals when they would have preferred to\r\n  serve in person. Henry II., by his purely arbitrary will,\r\n  levied five _escuages_ in the course of his reign.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these taxes levied by the king, another must be\r\nmentioned called the _danegeld_, or tax paid for defence\r\nagainst the Danes; this tax was raised several times during this\r\nperiod on all lands throughout the kingdom. The last example of\r\nit is to be found in the twentieth year of the reign of Henry II.\r\n\r\nBy means of these independent revenues and arbitrary taxes, the\r\nNorman kings constantly kept up bodies of paid troops, who could\r\nenable them to exercise their power without restraint, which did\r\nnot take place till a considerably later period on the Continent.\r\n\r\nLastly, from William the Conqueror till Henry II. the judicial\r\npower tended always to concentrate itself in the hands of the\r\nking. In this last reign the work was very nearly accomplished:\r\nhow this came to pass, I will endeavour to show.\r\n\r\nOriginally the jurisdictions that co-existed were as follows:\r\n\r\n  1. The courts of hundred and the county-courts, or meetings of\r\n  the freeholders of these territorial subdivisions, under the\r\n  presidency of the sheriff:\r\n\r\n  2. The courts-baron, or feudal jurisdictions:\r\n\r\n  3. The grand court of the king, where the king and the\r\n  assembled barons administered justice to the barons in cases\r\n  between any of themselves, or in cases of appeal, which could\r\n  only take place when justice had been refused in the court of\r\n  the manor or county.\r\n\r\n{297}\r\n\r\n         The Court Of Exchequer.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Exchequer, instituted by William the Conqueror, was,\r\nat first, only a simple court for receiving the accounts of the\r\nadministration of the king's revenues, and those of the sheriffs,\r\nbailiffs, &c., and for judging the suits that arose on this\r\nsubject. It was composed of barons, chosen by the king to form\r\nhis council, and to aid him in his government. In proportion as\r\nthe larger assembly, the _Curia regis_, came to be held less\r\nfrequently, so did the Court of Exchequer gain in importance. The\r\nbarons who composed it began to judge on their own\r\nresponsibility, and alone, in the absence and before the\r\nconvocation of the assembly; this change was introduced by\r\nnecessity, confirmed by custom, and finally sanctioned and\r\nestablished by law. About the year 1164, another royal court of\r\njustice, distinct from the Court of Exchequer, arose out of it,\r\nthe members of which, however, were the same as those composing\r\nthe Court of Exchequer. The kings lent their assistance to this\r\nchange, because it benefited their revenues. At this period were\r\nestablished _writs of chancery_, which gave to purchasers\r\nthe right to apply at once to the royal justice, without\r\npreviously passing the subordinate courts of justice. Soon the\r\nignorance of the freeholders, who composed the county-courts,\r\nnecessitated the same extension of the royal justice there also,\r\nand, in the reign of Henry I., _itinerant justices_ were\r\nsent into the counties, in order to administer there in the same\r\nway as was done by the Court of Exchequer. This institution was\r\nin full vigour only during the reign of Henry II.\r\n\r\nIn this way the predominant influence of the king, in judicial\r\norder, was established; this was a powerful instrument in\r\nproducing centralization and unity, and yet, as the royal judges\r\nonly interposed their services as supplementary to the\r\ninstitution of the jury, and did not substitute them for it, for\r\nquestions of fact and questions of right remained distinct,--the\r\ngerm of free institutions, that existed in the judicial order,\r\nwas not entirely destroyed.\r\n\r\n{298}\r\n         Functions Of The National Assembly.\r\n\r\nA king invested with such powerful resources could with\r\ndifficulty be restrained by an irregular assembly; accordingly\r\nthe government of the Norman kings was almost always arbitrary\r\nand despotic. Persons and property were never in security; the\r\nlaws, taxes, and judicial sentences were almost always merely an\r\nexpression of the royal will.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider these facts collectively, we may be led to two\r\nvery opposite results, according to the point of view from which\r\nwe regard them: on the one hand, we see the general assembly of\r\nthe nation interfering pretty frequently in public affairs, not\r\nby virtue of any particular official character it possessed, nor\r\nfor the purpose of exercising any one special right, such as that\r\nof making general laws, or of voting supplies, but on occasions\r\nwidely differing from one another, and for the purpose of\r\nacquiescing in the entire course of government. Laws, external\r\nrelations, peace, war, ecclesiastical affairs, the judgment of\r\nimportant cases, the administration of the royal domains,\r\nnominations to great public offices, even the interior economy\r\nand proceedings of the royal family, all seem to belong to the\r\nprovince of this national assembly. No matter is foreign to it,\r\nno function forbidden to it, no kind of investigation or of\r\naction refused to it. All distinction of provinces, all lines of\r\ndemarcation between the prerogatives of the crown and those of\r\nthe assembly, appear to be unknown; we might say that the entire\r\ngovernment belonged to the assembly, and that it exercised in a\r\ndirect way that activity, that general supervision, which belongs\r\nindirectly to the mature and perfected representative system, by\r\nvirtue of its influence on the choice of those who are to be the\r\ndepositaries of power, and by means of the principle of\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if we forget the assembly and examine the\r\nroyal power, as isolated, we shall see it exercising itself in a\r\nmultitude of cases, in as absolute and arbitrary a manner as if\r\nno assembly had existed to share in the government. The king, on\r\nhis own responsibility, made laws, levied taxes, dispossessed\r\nproprietors, condemned and banished important persons, and\r\nexercised, in a word, all the rights of unlimited sovereignty.\r\nThis sovereignty appears entire, sometimes in the hands of the\r\nassembly, sometimes in those of the king; when the assembly\r\nproceeds to interfere in all the details of government, we do not\r\nfind any complaint from the king, as if an encroachment had been\r\nmade on his prerogatives; and when, on the other hand, the king\r\ngoverns despotically, we do not find the assembly bestirring\r\nitself to protest against the extension of royal power, as a blow\r\naimed at their rights.\r\n\r\n{299}\r\n\r\n         Co-existence Of Opposing Forces.\r\n\r\nThus we are met by two classes of facts, simultaneously existing\r\nin this infancy of society,--facts which seem to belong to a\r\nfully developed system of free institutions, and facts which are\r\ncharacteristic of absolute power. On the one hand, the aim of\r\nfree governments, which is, that the nation should interfere,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, in all public affairs, seems to be\r\nattained; on the other hand, the independent and arbitrary\r\ndomination of the royal power appears to be recognized.\r\n\r\nThis is a result that must necessarily arise in the disorder of a\r\nnascent and troubled stage of civilization. Society is then a\r\nprey to chaos;--all the rights and all the powers of a community\r\nco-exist, but they are confounded, unregulated, unmarked by\r\nlimits, and without any legal guarantee;--freemen have not yet\r\nabdicated any of their liberties, nor has force yet renounced any\r\nof its pretensions. If any one had said to the barons of William,\r\nor of Henry I., that they had nothing to do with affairs of\r\nState, except to comply when the king demanded an impost, they\r\nwould have been indignant. All the affairs of the State were\r\ntheirs, because they were interested in them; and when they were\r\ncalled upon to deliberate concerning peace or war, they believed\r\nthat they were exercising a right belonging to them, and not\r\nmaking a conquest over royal authority. No freeman, who was\r\nstrong enough to defend his freedom, recognized any right in\r\nanother person to dispose of him without his consent, and found\r\nit a very simple matter to give his advice on questions that were\r\ninteresting to him. The king, in his turn, measuring his right by\r\nhis force, did not recognize in any person, nor, consequently, in\r\nany assembly, the legal right to prevent him from doing that\r\nwhich he was able to do. There were then, properly speaking, no\r\npublic rights or powers at all; they were almost entirely\r\nindividual and dependent on circumstances; they are to be found,\r\nbut in a state of isolation, unconscious of their own nature,\r\nand, indeed, of their very existence.\r\n\r\n{300}\r\n         Origin Of Royal Prerogative.\r\n\r\nIn this disorderly state of things, the able and energetic\r\ngovernment of William I., Henry I. and Henry II. caused the royal\r\npower gradually to assume a much more general and consistent\r\ncharacter. Accordingly, national assemblies became by degrees\r\nmore rare and less influential; under Stephen, they almost\r\nentirely disappeared. The barons no longer had a common\r\nmeeting-point, and were more occupied with the rule of their own\r\ndomains than with any association with the royal power for the\r\npurpose of controlling or restraining it. Each devoted himself\r\nmore exclusively to his own affairs, and the king, following this\r\nexample, made himself almost the sole master of those of the\r\nState. He availed himself of the need of order and regularity\r\nthat made itself felt every day, in order to constitute himself,\r\nin some sort, the dispenser of them. By these means he soon\r\nbecame the first in name, as well as the most powerful in fact.\r\nThrough him, the roads became more secure; he protected the\r\nfeeble, and repressed robbers. The maintenance of public order\r\ndevolved upon the royal power, and became the means of extending\r\nand strengthening it more and more. Whatever the king had\r\npossessed himself of by conquest, he vindicated as his own by\r\nright. Thus was formed the royal prerogative.\r\n\r\n\r\n         The Barons And The King.\r\n\r\nBut at the same time different circumstances concurred to draw\r\nthe barons forth from their isolation, to unite them among\r\nthemselves, and to form them into an aristocracy. The\r\nAnglo-Norman throne was successively occupied by three usurpers,\r\nWilliam II., Henry I., and Stephen. Invested with a power whose\r\ntitle was doubtful, they felt the necessity of bringing the\r\nbarons to recognize their claims; hence the first charters were\r\nconceded. No one of the barons was powerful enough, in himself,\r\nto restrain the threatened extension of royal power, but they\r\nformed the habit of making coalitions; and as each of the barons\r\nentering into such coalitions, felt the necessity of attaching\r\nhis vassals to himself, concessions were made to them also. The\r\nabsence of large fiefs, in England, served the cause both of\r\npower and of liberty; it allowed power to form itself into unity\r\nwith greater facility, and it obliged liberty to seek for\r\nguarantees in the spirit of association.\r\n{301}\r\nThat which finally contributed in the most decided way to form\r\nand consolidate this aristocratic coalition, was the irregular\r\nand usurping conduct of John during the long absence of Richard\r\nCœur-de-Lion, and the disorders and civil wars which were\r\nnaturally the results of this absence. In the midst of these\r\ndisorders the government fell into the hands of a council of\r\nbarons, that is to say, of a portion of the aristocracy. Those\r\nwho had no share whatever in the central power did not cease to\r\ncontrol it, and to regard it as rightfully theirs; in this way,\r\nthe one party formed a habit of governing, the other that of\r\nresisting a government which was in the hands of their equals,\r\nand not of the king himself. John, by his cowardice and\r\nill-judged familiarity, had brought the throne into disrespect\r\nbefore he himself ascended it, and his barons much more easily\r\nconceived the idea of resisting as a king, one whom they had\r\ndespised as a prince.\r\n\r\nThus, in the space of a hundred and thirty years, two elements in\r\nthe State, which were at first confounded and had almost acted in\r\ncommon, were separated and formed into distinct powers,--the\r\nroyal power on the one hand, and on the other, the company of\r\nbarons. The struggle between these two forces then commenced, and\r\nwe shall see royalty continually occupied in defending its\r\nprivileges, and the aristocracy as unweariedly busying itself in\r\nthe endeavour to extort new concessions. The history of the\r\nEnglish charters, from the reign of William I. to that of Edward\r\nI., who granted them a general confirmation, is the history of\r\nthis struggle, to which England is indebted for the earliest\r\nappearance of the germs of a free government, that is to say, of\r\npublic rights and political guarantees.\r\n\r\n{302}\r\n\r\n              Lecture VI.\r\n\r\n  History of English Charters.\r\n\r\n  Charter of William the Conqueror (1071).\r\n\r\n  Charter of Henry I. (1101).\r\n\r\n  Charters of Stephen (1135-1136).\r\n\r\n  Charter of Henry II. (1154).\r\n\r\n\r\n         Progress Towards Free Government.\r\n\r\nLiberties are nothing until they have become rights,--positive\r\nrights formally recognized and consecrated. Rights, even when\r\nrecognized, are nothing so long as they are not entrenched within\r\nguarantees. And lastly, guarantees are nothing so long as they\r\nare not maintained by forces independent of them, in the limit of\r\ntheir rights. Convert liberties into rights, surround rights by\r\nguarantees, entrust the keeping of these guarantees to forces\r\ncapable of maintaining them--such are the successive steps in the\r\nprogress towards a free government.\r\n\r\nThis progress was exactly realized in England in the struggle,\r\nthe history of which we are about to trace. Liberties first\r\nconverted themselves into rights; when rights were nearly\r\nrecognized, guarantees were sought for them; and lastly, these\r\nguarantees were placed in the hands of regular powers. In this\r\nway a representative system of government was formed.\r\n\r\nWe may date from the reign of King John as the period when the\r\nefforts of the English aristocracy to procure a recognition and\r\nestablishment of their rights became conspicuous; they then\r\ndemanded and extorted charters. During the reign of Edward I.,\r\nthe charters were fully recognized and confirmed; they became\r\nreal public rights. And it was at the same epoch that a\r\nParliament began to be definitely formed, that is to say, the\r\norganization of political guarantees commenced, and with it the\r\ncreation of the regular power to which they are entrusted.\r\n\r\nI have shown how the two great public forces--royalty and the\r\ncouncil of barons, were formed, cemented, and brought into\r\njuxtaposition. We must now follow these forces into the combats\r\nin which they engaged their energies in order to have their\r\nreciprocal rights recognized and regulated; and to do this we\r\nmust trace the history of English charters. I shall then enquire\r\nhow the guarantees were organized, that is to say, how the\r\nParliament was formed.\r\n\r\n{303}\r\n\r\n    Charter Of William The Conqueror.\r\n\r\nWhen William the Conqueror arrived in England, his position with\r\nrespect to the Norman barons and knights had been already\r\nregulated on the Continent by the feudal law; their respective\r\nrights were fixed and recognized. After the Conquest, fear of the\r\nAnglo-Saxons kept the king and the Normans so far united, that\r\nneither of them cared much to extort concessions from the other.\r\nVery different, however, were the relations between William and\r\nhis English subjects. He had to adjust these relations,--here was\r\na legislation to be created, and rights to be recognized or\r\ncontested. The English made the most strenuous efforts to\r\npreserve their Saxon laws, and it appears to have been in the\r\nfourth year of William's reign (the year 1071) that they\r\nsucceeded in gaining an assurance that these laws should be\r\nmaintained. There is reason to believe that on this occasion he\r\ngranted the charter intituled, \"_Charta regis de quibusdam\r\nstatutis per totam Angliam firmiter observandis._\" Some have\r\nasserted that this charter was not granted till nearly the end of\r\nWilliam's reign, but I see no reason for assigning any other\r\nperiod to it than that which I have mentioned.\r\n\r\nThis charter, the authenticity of which [Footnote 19] has been\r\nsometimes questioned, I think on insufficient grounds, is a kind\r\nof vague declaration containing the general principles of feudal\r\npolitical law.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 19: The original is lost, but a copy of it exists\r\n    in the Red Book of the Exchequer, which gives a strong\r\n    presumption for its authenticity. Besides, the charter of\r\n    Henry I. makes a distinct allusion to it.]\r\n\r\nWilliam, in it, recognizes rights which he often allowed himself\r\nto violate; for his power rendered the violation of his promises\r\neasy. The Norman barons did not form themselves into any body,\r\nunless perhaps against the English; they were all too much\r\noccupied in the work of establishing themselves in their new\r\ndomains. If they sometimes roused themselves to oppose the\r\ntyranny of William, their revolts were only partial, and the king\r\nadroitly used the English in order to put them down.\r\n{304}\r\nHis son, William Rufus, by adopting the same policy, obtained\r\nsimilar success. But Henry I. had to pay for his usurpation; the\r\ncharter which he granted was the inevitable consequence of his\r\npossession of the throne.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Charters Of Henry I.\r\n\r\nThis charter of Henry's contains a solemn promise to respect all\r\nancient rights. In it the king promises no more to follow _all\r\nthe evil practices_ by which the kingdom of England was\r\noppressed under the king his brother, that is to say, not to\r\nappropriate the revenues of vacant abbacies and bishoprics, nor\r\nagain to sell or farm ecclesiastical benefices, and to permit the\r\nheirs of his vassals to inherit their possessions on paying a\r\njust and legitimate fine. He assures to his barons their right to\r\ngive their daughters or sisters in marriage to whomsoever they\r\nwill, provided it be not to one of the king's enemies; he grants\r\nto widows who are left without children the possession of their\r\ndowry and jointure, and liberty to marry again according to their\r\nfree choice; and he renounces the right of guardianship, placing\r\nit in the hands either of the wife or some relative. He gives to\r\nall his vassals the right to dispose of their property either by\r\ngift or by will, renounces the right arbitrarily to levy taxes on\r\nthe farms of his vassals, abandons the forests which William\r\nRufus had usurped, and abolished feudal aids, even in the three\r\ncases which we have already specified. Lastly, he withdraws the\r\nright of coining from the towns and counties, pardons all the\r\noffences and crimes committed before his reign, and recommends\r\nhis vassals to allow their vassals to enjoy all the advantages\r\nwhich he accords to them.\r\n\r\nThese concessions were merely recognitions of rights, without\r\nguarantees. Henry, accordingly, despite his oaths, violated these\r\nmagnificent promises; and the abuses which they ought to have\r\nremoved were not diminished in any degree, during the whole\r\nextent of his reign.\r\n\r\nAnother charter was granted by Henry I. to the city of London, by\r\nwhich it was authorized, among other things, to elect its own\r\nsheriff and chief magistrate, to hold its accustomed assemblies,\r\nnot to pay either the _danegeld_ or any other _scot_,\r\nor imposts for works along rivers, and not to give lodging to the\r\nretinue of the king.\r\n\r\n{305}\r\n\r\nLastly, we find new promises and new concessions made by Henry I.\r\nin 1101, when his brother Robert laid claim to his rights.\r\nWishing to assure himself of the fidelity of his barons, Henry\r\nassembled them at London, and delivered to them a speech, in\r\nwhich, after having given a hideous representation of Robert's\r\nperson, he added:--\"As for me, I am truly a mild king, modest and\r\npacific; I will preserve to you, and diligently guard your\r\nancient liberties, which I have before sworn to maintain; I will\r\nlisten with patience to your wise suggestions, and will govern\r\nyou justly after the example of the best princes. If you desire\r\nit, I will confirm this promise by a written charter, and I will\r\nswear afresh to observe inviolably all the laws of the holy king\r\nEdward,\" &c. &c.\r\n\r\nThese promises, made in a moment of danger, were always forgotten\r\nas soon as ever the danger had disappeared. During his entire\r\nreign, Henry continually violated the charter to which he had\r\nbound himself by oath, both as regards matters relating to feudal\r\ndependence, and in the levying of imposts. According to the\r\nhistorians, he levied each year a tax of twelve pence on every\r\nhide of land, a tax which was probably identical with the\r\n_danegeld_.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Charters Of Stephen.\r\n\r\nStephen, Henry's successor, granted charters to his subjects as\r\nHenry had done, and these charters were also the result of\r\nusurpation. He published two; the first only confirmed the\r\nliberties granted by Henry I., and the laws of Edward the\r\nConfessor. The second is remarkable as containing a promise made\r\nby Stephen to reform the abuses and exactions of his sheriffs. At\r\nthis period public offices were farmed, and those who filled\r\nthem, seeking to gain all the advantages possible from them, were\r\nfar more oppressive on their own account than on account of the\r\nking. Accordingly it was no difficult matter to appeal to the\r\nking against his own officers. Such a mode of appeal, however,\r\nindicates that legal and regular guarantees were unrecognized and\r\nbut little thought of. The barons however began to procure them,\r\nby force. They obtained from the king permission to fortify their\r\ncastles and put themselves in a state of defence. And the clergy\r\non their part, while taking the oath of fidelity, attached to it\r\na condition that they should be released from its obligation as\r\nsoon as the king should trespass on ecclesiastical liberties.\r\n\r\n{306}\r\n\r\n              Charter Of Henry II.\r\n\r\nThe charter granted by Henry II., about the year 1154, still\r\nexpresses nothing more than a recognition of rights; it does not\r\ncontain any new promise, or any concession of guarantees. The\r\nreign of this prince, I need hardly remind you, was entirely\r\noccupied with his disputes with the clergy, with the revolts of\r\nhis sons, and with his conquests, both on the Continent and in\r\nIreland. No important differences were brought into discussion\r\nbetween him and his barons; no progress in existing institutions\r\nis visible, and we may say that the reign of Henry II.,\r\nconsidered from this point of view, was orderly and stationary.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the king, so far as his relations to his barons were\r\nconcerned, obtained an almost uninterrupted submission, and\r\ncaused the demolition of most of those fortified castles which\r\nhad been constructed during the preceding reign, the towns on the\r\nother hand, and especially the city of London, increased in\r\nstrength and importance, and the aristocracy became every day\r\nmore compact by means of the fusion of the Normans and the\r\nEnglish, a fusion which was almost completed during this reign,\r\nat least among the upper classes.\r\n\r\nThe fact of this period which bears most importantly upon the\r\nsubject which we have under consideration, is the substitution of\r\nthe _escuage_ for the personal service of the vassals. It is\r\nunder the reign of Henry II. that we find this impost collected\r\nfor the first time, at least in the form of a general measure.\r\nThe establishment and limitations of the _escuage_ became\r\nsoon the principal object of contention between the king and his\r\nbarons. The use which the kings came to make of the resources\r\nderived from this impost was fatal to them, for they employed it\r\nin order to keep up armies of foreign mercenaries, especially\r\nBrabanters; and by these measures, they gave a new motive to the\r\nEnglish barons to coalesce. The expulsion of foreign soldiers\r\nbecame at length one of the continually recurring demands of the\r\nbarons.\r\n\r\nHenry II. towards the close of his reign, imposed by his own\r\nauthority a tax of one sixth on all moveable property. He\r\nabandoned the _danegeld_.\r\n\r\n{307}\r\n\r\n              Reign Of Richard I.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Richard, which was entirely occupied with his\r\nbrilliant but unfortunate expeditions, offers nothing especially\r\nillustrative of the history of institutions. The absence of the\r\nking and the weakness of the royal power supplied the feudal\r\naristocracy with opportunities for extending their importance;\r\nbut they did not at that time take advantage of their superiority\r\nto procure a recognition of their rights;--not until the reign of\r\nJohn did the struggle become violent and the victory decisive.\r\n\r\n{308}\r\n\r\n               Lecture VII.\r\n\r\n  Charter of John, or the Great Charter (1215).\r\n\r\n  Three epochs in John's reign.\r\n\r\n  Formation of a coalition among the barons.\r\n\r\n  Civil war.\r\n\r\n  Conference at Runnymead.\r\n\r\n  Concession of the Great Charter.\r\n\r\n  Analysis of this Charter.\r\n\r\n  Its stipulations refer to national rights as well as to those\r\n  of the barons.\r\n\r\n  John petitions and obtains from Innocent III. a bull to reverse\r\n  the Great Charter.\r\n\r\n  Resistance of the English clergy.\r\n\r\n  Recommencement of the civil war (October, 1215).\r\n\r\n  Louis of France, son of Philip Augustus, is appealed to by the\r\n  barons.\r\n\r\n  Death of John (October, 1216).\r\n\r\n\r\n         Reign Of King John.\r\n\r\nDuring King Richard's absence, the administration of the kingdom\r\nhad fallen into the hands of the barons: the feudal aristocracy\r\nhad begun again to interfere directly in the government, both by\r\nway of encroachment and of resistance. Still, the acts of the\r\nbarons had no longer the same character which they possessed\r\nunder the preceding reigns; they no longer offered an open\r\nresistance; they did not demand any new charters; they did not\r\npetition for the observance of former ones: but they silently\r\ncollected their forces in anticipation of a struggle which was to\r\nbe decisive. We find them submitting to the exactions which\r\nRichard imposed on all classes of society, both for his crusade\r\nand for his ransom. Nevertheless, the old maxims as to the\r\nnecessity of obtaining the consent of the barons to every\r\nextraordinary imposition, had revived with new vigour. This right\r\nof giving consent to tributes was vindicated with an increasingly\r\ndetermined firmness; and in the first assembly, which Richard\r\nheld at Nottingham after his return from the East, he was unable\r\nto establish an impost of two shillings on every hide of land\r\nuntil he had obtained the consent of his barons. Already every\r\ntribute that was levied on the sole authority of the king had\r\nbegun to stir up a spirit of resistance. This resistance declared\r\nitself as soon as John ascended the throne, and the opposition\r\nwhich had been preparing during the reign of Richard then started\r\ninto prominence.\r\n\r\n{309}\r\n\r\n         Opposition Of The Barons.\r\n\r\nThe reign of John may be divided into three epochs: from 1199\r\ntill 1206, he was occupied with his quarrels with the king ol\r\nFrance, and with the struggle which arose from the refusal of the\r\nbarons to second him in his continental enterprises. From 1206 to\r\n1213, John was occupied by his disputes with the Pope and the\r\nclergy. Lastly, from the year 1213 to the close of his reign, his\r\nposition with reference to the barons and the clergy became more\r\nand more hostile; it revealed to him their power and his own\r\nfeebleness; and constantly succumbing before them, we see him\r\nyielding one point after another to the clergy and barons, who\r\nwere always united in their attacks upon him, until at length he\r\ngranted that celebrated charta usually called Magna Charta, which\r\nis a lasting monument of John's defeat and the abiding basis of\r\nthe English constitution.\r\n\r\nJohn was not the lawful heir to the crown; it belonged to his\r\nnephew, Arthur, Duke of Bretagne, whose rights were further\r\nconfirmed by a testament of Richard. Nevertheless, by his\r\nlargesses and his yielding disposition, John found no difficulty\r\nin usurping the throne of England. The opposition was stronger in\r\nhis continental possessions; the feudal ideas there prevailing\r\nfavoured the system of representation, and the people were more\r\ndisposed to recognize the claims of a son than those of a\r\nbrother. Anjou, Poitou, Maine and Touraine declared for Arthur.\r\nIn 1201 (others say in 1204) John demanded of the barons, whom he\r\nhad assembled at Oxford, that they should assist him in the war\r\nwhich he purposed carrying on in France. They required, as the\r\nprice of their assistance, that the king should promise to\r\nrestore to them their liberties and privileges. John, without\r\nhaving granted anything to them, succeeded in winning over one\r\nafter another, until he had obtained from each individually what\r\nhad been refused to him by all when assembled. Nevertheless, this\r\nopposition showed that the coalition among the barons had taken\r\nshape and consistence.\r\n\r\nJohn, who had as yet done nothing to deserve that his usurpation\r\nshould be overlooked, rendered himself odious by an imprudent\r\ndivorce, and by vexatious indignities. He introduced into his\r\nretinue, bullies, whom he called champions of royalty; and he\r\nobliged the discontented barons to enter into the lists with\r\nthem, and to settle, by these pretended judicial combats, their\r\ndisputes with the crown.\r\n{310}\r\nAt length, his exactions, his tyrannical proceedings, and above\r\nall, the murder of Arthur, whom he is said to have assassinated\r\nwith his own hand, excited against him an almost general rising.\r\nAbandoned by his barons, driven from Normandy, Anjou, Maine,\r\nTouraine, and a part of Poitou, John, instead of conciliating the\r\nminds of his people, only acted in such a manner as to alienate\r\nthem more and more, and only defended himself by rendering\r\nhimself more odious. A new _escuage_ of two marks and a half\r\nfor every knight's fief was extorted from the barons. John had,\r\ntherefore, to endure a new refusal when he asked them a second\r\ntime to follow him to the Continent. In vain was it that he\r\nemployed those means which had before succeeded; he was obliged\r\nto yield, and to allow Philip Augustus to take possession of\r\nNormandy, and reunite it to the crown of France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         Quarrels With The Clergy.\r\n\r\nIt was not enough for John that he had entered into hostilities\r\nwith the lay aristocracy; he still further made himself inimical\r\nto the clergy. On the death of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the\r\nAugustin monks had arrogated to themselves the right of\r\nappointing his successor without the consent of the king. John,\r\nnettled by this invasion of his prerogatives, united with the\r\nbishops, who also protested against an election in which they had\r\ntaken no part, and in concert with them, nominated the Bishop of\r\nNorwich to the vacant see. Upon this, Innocent III. interfered in\r\nthe dispute;--but without confirming either of the two elections,\r\nhe ordered the English clergy to choose Cardinal Stephen Langton.\r\nThe king, enraged against the Court of Rome, drove all the monks\r\nfrom Canterbury, and made himself master of their revenues.\r\nAccordingly, the Pope excommunicated the monarch, placed the\r\nwhole kingdom under his ban, and released his subjects from the\r\noath of fidelity which they had sworn to John. Moreover, he\r\ncharged Philip Augustus to execute his decrees, and offered to\r\nhim the crown of England. Philip eagerly accepted the present,\r\nwhile John, frightened by the double danger which pressed upon\r\nhim, demanded, but in vain, assistance from his barons;--he had\r\nacted unjustly towards them, and now he found them indifferent to\r\nhis misfortunes. At last, stripped of all resources and left\r\nwithout hope, he sought safety in submission, and saved himself\r\nby means of base servility: he declared himself a vassal of the\r\npope, and engaged to pay him annually a tribute of a thousand\r\nmarks.\r\n\r\n{311}\r\n\r\n         Commencement Of The Civil War.\r\n\r\nAfter John had thus ransomed his crown, he soon endangered it\r\nagain by renewed acts of imprudence; his base tyranny, and his\r\ncriminal attempts on the wife of Eustace de Vesci, roused the\r\nbarons against him, and their opposition, was directed and\r\nstimulated by the primate Langton.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be wondered at that the feudal aristocracy should\r\nact under the guidance of an ecclesiastic; the two orders made\r\ncommon cause, and this coalition, which preceding kings had\r\nalways endeavoured to prevent, was one of the effects of John's\r\nodious and absurd conduct. He forgot that the royal power could\r\nonly maintain itself so long as the power of the clergy and that\r\nof the barons balanced one another; when they united, he was\r\nobliged to succumb. Their union was the result of John's base\r\nsubmission to the Holy See; the English clergy, tired of the\r\ndespotism of Rome, and regretting the loss of their privileges,\r\nopenly embraced the cause of national liberty.\r\n\r\nSuch was the pervading feeling, when (August 25, 1213) an\r\nassembly of the barons was convened at London. In one of their\r\nmeetings, Cardinal Langton informed them that he had found a copy\r\nof the charter of Henry I., which was then entirely forgotten;\r\nthis charter was read to the assembly, and received with\r\nenthusiasm. Another meeting was held at Saint Edmundsbury\r\n(November 20, 1214), and there each baron, laying his hand upon\r\nthe altar, took an oath that he would use his efforts to force\r\nthe king to restore in full vigour the charter of Henry I. They\r\nsoon presented themselves at London in arms, and on January 5,\r\n1215, they demanded from John, in a formal and positive way, the\r\nrenewal of this charter, as well as of the laws of Edward the\r\nConfessor. John, terrified by their firmness, requested that some\r\nleisure might be granted to him in order to think over these\r\ndemands, and accordingly his answer was deferred till Easter.\r\nDuring this interval, he endeavoured to introduce division among\r\nhis enemies, and in the first place, wishing to conciliate the\r\nclergy, he granted them by a charter the liberty of electing\r\ntheir own bishops and abbots, and sent William de Mauclerc to\r\nRome to complain of the audacity of the barons.\r\n{312}\r\nThey too despatched Eustace de Vesci to Rome, to represent to the\r\npontiff the justice and sacredness of their cause. This embassy,\r\nhowever, failed in its object; the Pope condemned the barons: but\r\nthey were not to be intimidated from their purposes, and John,\r\ndetermining to make another effort in order to secure the support\r\nof the church, took the cross on the 2nd of February, 1215, and\r\nmade a vow to lead an army into Palestine.\r\n\r\nThe respite, however, which the barons had granted to the king\r\ncame to an end, and they met again at Stamford in Lincolnshire,\r\non the 19th of April, 1215, being followed by nearly two thousand\r\nknights in arms. The king asked them what their claims were; they\r\nmade at Stamford the same answer as they had made in London, and\r\npresented the charter which they had sworn to establish. \"And why\r\ndo they not demand my crown also?\" exclaimed John in his fury;\r\n\"by God's teeth, I will not grant them liberties which will make\r\nme a slave.\" This answer was taken as a declaration of war, and\r\non the 5th of May following, the barons met at Wallingford,\r\nsolemnly renounced their oath of allegiance, and at the same time\r\nnamed Robert Fitz-Walter general of the \"army of God and of Holy\r\nChurch.\"\r\n\r\nWar was declared: in vain did the Pope address letters to the\r\nbarons, in which he commanded them to desist from their\r\nenterprise; the hostilities which had been commenced only\r\ncontinued with greater vigour, and on the 24th of May, the\r\ntriumphant barons took possession of London with the consent of\r\nthe citizens. John left the city and retired to Odiham, in the\r\ncounty of Hampshire, with no other escort than seven knights.\r\nFrom his retreat he attempted, without success, to enter into\r\nnegotiations; he proposed the intervention of the Pope, but this\r\nwas also refused: baffled in all his attempts, he was at length\r\nnecessitated to acquiesce in the law which had been forcibly\r\nimposed on him.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Conference At Runnymead.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of June, a conference was opened in the plain called\r\nRunnymead, between Windsor and Staines. The two parties had\r\nseparate encampments, as declared enemies; after some trifling\r\ndebates, the king at first adopted the preliminary articles, and\r\nfour days after, on the 19th of June, 1215, he made the grant of\r\nthe famous act known by the name of the Great Charter,--Magna\r\nCharta.\r\n\r\n{313}\r\n\r\n         Analysis Of Magna Charta.\r\n\r\nThis charter, the most complete and important that had yet\r\nappeared, may be divided into three distinct parts; one referring\r\nto the interests of the clergy, another regulating those of the\r\nnobility, and the third, those belonging to the people. This\r\nmethodical division is not taken from the order in which the\r\narticles of the actual charter are distributed, but I have here\r\nadopted it in order to render my account of it more natural and\r\ndistinct.\r\n\r\nThe Great Charter refers but little to ecclesiastical interests,\r\nsince they had been settled by the charter already granted to the\r\nclergy. All that was therefore required was that this should be\r\nconfirmed. This accordingly is done in the first article, which\r\ngrants a general confirmation to all ecclesiastical immunities\r\nand privileges.\r\n\r\nThe privileges of the laity, on the other hand, were more\r\nuncertain, and more strongly contested; it was therefore\r\nnecessary that they should be minutely investigated and\r\nseparately conceded. The Great Charter is almost entirely devoted\r\nto the settlement of the rights, and the confirmation of the\r\nprivileges, claimed by the laity.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it determines with precision what had been\r\nobscure and ambiguous in the feudal laws; and it fixes the amount\r\nof relief which the immediate or indirect inheritors of fiefs\r\nshould pay. Hitherto this relief had been indeterminate. (Arts. 2\r\nto 3.)\r\n\r\nThen follow the precautions prescribed respecting the marriage of\r\nfeudal wards, and those which regard the widows and children of\r\nvassals. (Arts. 6 to 8.)\r\n\r\nThe right and mode of collecting aids and escuages, are regulated\r\nby the two following articles:--\r\n\r\n  \"Art. 12. That no escuage or extraordinary aid shall be imposed\r\n  in our kingdom, except by the national council of our kingdom,\r\n  unless it be to ransom our person, to equip our eldest son as a\r\n  knight, and to marry our eldest daughter: and for these last\r\n  cases only a reasonable amount of aid shall be demanded, &c.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Art. 14. In order to hold the national council of the kingdom,\r\n  for the purpose of imposing any other aid than for the three\r\n  cases heretofore mentioned, or to impose an escuage, we will\r\n  call together the archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls and great\r\n  barons, individually and by letters from ourself; and we will\r\n  assemble together by means of our viscounts and bailiffs, all\r\n  those who are directly dependent upon us.\r\n{314}\r\n  The great convocation shall be made on a fixed day, namely, at\r\n  intervals not greater than forty days, and in an appointed\r\n  place; and in the letters of convocation we will expound the\r\n  reason of such convocation; and the convocation thus made, the\r\n  business shall be transacted on the day appointed, by the\r\n  council consisting of those who are present, although all those\r\n  who have been summoned may not have arrived.\"\r\n\r\nThis charter is the first document in which we find a distinction\r\nestablished between the greater and lesser barons, and the higher\r\nand lower clergy; an important fact, since it may perhaps be\r\nregarded as the original source of the separation between the two\r\nHouses of Parliament.\r\n\r\nLastly, several articles have for their object to limit the\r\nrights of the king on the lands of his tenants, to fix the amount\r\nof fine imposed on beneficiaries according to the gravity of\r\ntheir offence, to determine the length of time during which lands\r\nshould remain sequestrated on account of felony; in one word, to\r\ngive to the barons greater independence and security than they\r\nhad ever before enjoyed.\r\n\r\nThese are the principal enactments of the Great Charter in favour\r\nof the nobility; up to this point, we find only sanctions given\r\nto particular privileges, we have only met with that which\r\nfavours the interests of certain classes in society. But it\r\ncontains also clauses of wider and more general application; it\r\nhas for its object also the interests of the nation as a whole.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, almost all the immunities granted to the barons\r\nwith respect to the king, the vassals obtained with respect to\r\ntheir lords. These were not allowed from this time to collect\r\naids and escuages on their lands, except in the same cases and in\r\nthe same manner as the king. (Art. 15.)\r\n\r\nJustice was for the future to be administered in a fixed and\r\nuniform manner; the following are the articles in which this\r\nimportant provision is expressed:--\r\n\r\n  \"Art. 17. The court of common pleas shall not follow our court\r\n  (_curia_), but shall be held in a fixed place.\r\n\r\n  \"Art. 18. We, or if we are absent from the kingdom, our chief\r\n  justiciary, shall send four times a year into each county two\r\n  judges, who, with four knights, chosen by each county, shall\r\n  hold the assizes at the time and place appointed in the said\r\n  county.\"\r\n\r\n{315}\r\n\r\n  \"Art. 39. No freeman shall be arrested or imprisoned, or\r\n  dispossessed of his tenement, or outlawed, or exiled, or in\r\n  anywise proceeded against; we will not place or cause to be\r\n  placed hands upon him, unless by the _legal judgment of his\r\n  peers or by the law of the land_.\r\n\r\n  \"Art. 40. _Justice shall not be sold, refused, or delayed to\r\n  anyone._\"\r\n\r\nMoreover, the king promises to appoint only capable and upright\r\njudges (Art. 41); to forbid their condemning any person whatever,\r\nwithout having previously heard the witnesses (Art. 38); to\r\nreinstate every man who had been dispossessed without legal\r\njudgment (Art. 32); to repair the injuries committed under Henry\r\nII., and Richard I. (Art. 53); to put a stop to the imposts for\r\nthe construction of bridges (Art. 23); and to interdict\r\nannoyances of all kinds inflicted either on townsmen, merchants,\r\nor villeins (Arts. 20, 26, 28, 30, 31).\r\n\r\nHe grants and assures to the city of London, as well as to all\r\nother cities, boroughs, towns, and harbours, the possession of\r\ntheir ancient customs and liberties (Art. 13).\r\n\r\nLastly, the 41st Article provides that all merchants shall have\r\nfull and free liberty of entering England, of leaving it, of\r\nremaining there, and of travelling there by land and by water, to\r\nbuy and to sell without being subject to any oppression (_male\r\ntoltâ_) according to the ancient and common usages, &c.\r\n\r\nThese, then, are the concessions made to promote the interests of\r\nall.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, enough that rights should be recognized and\r\npromises made; it is further necessary that these rights should\r\nbe respected, and that these promises should be fulfilled. The\r\n61st and last article of the Great Charter is intended to provide\r\nthis guarantee. It is there said that the barons shall elect\r\ntwenty-five barons by their own free choice, charged to exercise\r\nall vigilance that the provisions of the Charter may be carried\r\ninto effect, the powers of these twenty-five barons is unlimited\r\nif the king or his agents allow themselves to violate the\r\nenactments of the Charter in the smallest particular, the barons\r\nwill denounce this abuse before the king, and demand that it be\r\ninstantly checked.\r\n{316}\r\nIf the king do not accede to their demand, the barons shall have\r\nthe right, forty days after the summons has been issued by them,\r\nto prosecute the king, to deprive him of his lands and castles\r\n(the safety of his person, of the queen, and of their children,\r\nbeing respected), until the abuse has been reformed to the\r\nsatisfaction of the barons.\r\n\r\nThough such a right was granted, no guarantee was thereby given;\r\nit only authorized civil war; it was to perpetuate the struggle\r\nindefinitely, and formally to leave the ultimate decision of the\r\nquestion to force. It was still far from being a regularly\r\nconstituted political guarantee; but the spirit of that age was\r\nnot capable either of discovering or of comprehending such a\r\nguarantee--it could only understand the recognition of its\r\nrights. However, the forcible guarantee which the Great Charter\r\nestablished was so far valuable, inasmuch as it centralized the\r\nfeudal aristocracy by organizing the council of barons.\r\n\r\nIt has been often said that the Great Charter would not have been\r\nsupported by the barons had not it not been for its influence on\r\ntheir special interests. This opinion is untenable: how is it\r\npossible that at least a third of the articles should have\r\nrelated to promises and guarantees made on behalf of the people,\r\nif the aristocracy had only aimed at obtaining that which should\r\nbenefit themselves? We have only to read the Great Charter in\r\norder to be convinced that the rights of all three orders of the\r\nnation are equally respected and promoted.\r\n\r\nAnother question has been raised, as to whether John did or did\r\nnot grant a special charter relating to forests at the time when\r\nhe granted the Great Charter. Mathew Paris is the only author who\r\nspeaks of this charter of forests, and there are several reasons\r\nwhy his authority should in this matter be rejected. First of\r\nall, the preliminary articles of the Great Charter contain\r\nnothing on this point; in the second place, Articles 44, 47, and\r\n48 in the Great Charter itself settle whatever relates to\r\nforests; and lastly, the king and the Pope, in their\r\ncorrespondence prior to these events, make no allusion to this\r\ntwofold concession.\r\n\r\nWhen the king had distinctly adopted each article of the Great\r\nCharter, the agreement between him and his barons, which had been\r\nconcluded on the 15th of June, was executed in order to ensure\r\nthe fulfilment of his engagements. The guarding of the city of\r\nLondon was entrusted to the barons till the 15th of August\r\nfollowing, and that of the Tower to the Archbishop of Canterbury.\r\n\r\n{317}\r\n\r\n         Violation Of Magna Charta.\r\n\r\nJohn dissembled at first, and appeared to submit without any\r\nreserve to all the sacrifices which were imposed upon him; but\r\nsuch a mask soon became intolerable to him. After a short time he\r\nbroke out into complaints and threatenings, and retired in fury\r\nto the Isle of Wight. While there, he procured the enrolment of\r\nan army of Brabanters in order to regain his power by battle, and\r\ndespatched a messenger to Rome beseeching for aid against the\r\nviolence that had been done him. Innocent III., hearing what had\r\noccurred, and irritated by the audacity of the barons, whom he\r\ncalled his vassals, annulled the Great Charter, and\r\nexcommunicated all the barons who had joined in the rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe king, trusting to this powerful support, threw aside the\r\nmask, and retracted all his engagements. But he speedily\r\nperceived that those spiritual weapons, which had recently been\r\nso potent when opposed to him, were now without value when placed\r\nin his own hands. Archbishop Langton refused to pronounce the\r\nsentence of excommunication. He was summoned to Rome and\r\nsuspended, but in vain; the clergy sustained him in his disgrace,\r\nand confirmed his refusal. John attempted ineffectually to divide\r\nthe two orders,--whenever he made any preparations for fighting,\r\nthey became inseparable allies.\r\n\r\nJohn had now no other hope except in the support of his foreign\r\nmercenaries; he made one last effort, and in the month of October\r\n1215, war was again enkindled between him and the barons. The\r\nattack was unforeseen; the barons being suddenly surprised\r\nretreated before the king, who advanced in triumph as far as\r\nRochester Castle, of which he made himself master after an\r\nobstinately resisted siege. He made prisoner its governor,\r\nWilliam d'Albiney, one of the twenty-five barons appointed to\r\nguard the maintenance of the charter, and the most distinguished\r\ncaptain among them: this was an irreparable loss to their party;\r\nand from this moment the king met with no regular resistance. His\r\ntyranny might now glut itself with vengeance; he let loose his\r\nsatellites, and the entire kingdom was soon filled with the\r\ndevastating effects of his rage.\r\n\r\n{318}\r\n\r\nNevertheless, some barons in the north still resisted him\r\nmanfully; and the remnants of the coalition combined with them;\r\nbut feeling themselves too weak, they sought in their turn safety\r\nfrom a foreign ally. The crown of England was offered in their\r\nname to Prince Louis, son of Philip Augustus, who thereupon sent\r\nan army to attempt the conquest of England.\r\n\r\nLouis had scarcely landed when the aspect of affairs entirely\r\nchanged. John, abandoned by his friends and by his soldiers, lost\r\nin a short time all that he had recovered. The entire kingdom\r\nfell into the hands of his young rival, and Dover was the only\r\ntown which remained faithful to John. Prince Louis, however,\r\nthough he had so far succeeded, did not establish himself on his\r\nnewly acquired throne. The predilection which he invariably\r\nmanifested for the French nobles could not but be distasteful to\r\nthe English barons, and the avowals of the Count of Melun, made\r\non his deathbed, had the effect of detaching almost all the\r\nnobility of the kingdom from the side of Louis. This noble\r\ninduced the barons to distrust the king, who, he affirmed, fully\r\nintended to dispossess all of them, and to distribute their lands\r\namong his favourites and natural subjects. This disclosure,\r\nwhether it was true or false, had a powerful effect on the minds\r\nof the barons, and most of them renewed their allegiance to their\r\nformer king.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Death Of King John.\r\n\r\nJohn had now set his army on foot, and fortune seemed to promise\r\nhim new successes, when death surprised him on the 17th of\r\nOctober, 1216. This event was more fatal to Louis than a lost\r\nbattle could have been. The hatred of the English to their king\r\ndied with him--they hastened to rally round his young son--a\r\ngeneral defection quickly ruined the already tottering cause of\r\nthe French prince, and after he had continued this useless\r\nstruggle for a short time, he abandoned a throne for the offer of\r\nwhich he was indebted merely to the accidental distress of the\r\nEnglish barons, and which he would never have been able to secure\r\nby the mere force of his arms.\r\n\r\n{319}\r\n\r\n              Lecture VIII.\r\n\r\n  Charters of Henry III.\r\n\r\n  First Charter of Henry III.

(November 16, 1272).\r\n\r\n\r\n         Charters Of Henry III.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have only seen, in the charters, recognitions of\r\nrights more or less open and complete; they are transactions\r\nbetween two rival powers, one of whom gives promises while the\r\nother establishes rights; but there is no power to guarantee that\r\nthese promises shall be faithfully kept and these rights duly\r\nregarded. The only curb placed on royalty is the prospect of a\r\ncivil war that is always threatening to break out--a remedy which\r\nis incompatible with order and stability, two elements which are\r\nindispensable to a free government.\r\n\r\nUnder the reign of Henry III., the feeling began to be\r\nentertained that civil war is an evil guarantee; and other means\r\nof preventing the violation of oaths were sought and dimly\r\napprehended. The charters which were obtained in this reign have\r\nstill as their chief aim the obtaining of new concessions and\r\npromises; but efforts towards the formation of guarantees are\r\nalso apparent, and we may now trace the first attempts after a\r\nlegal and efficient constitution.\r\n\r\nThis reign must be regarded under the two aspects which have been\r\nindicated. Our object at present being only to follow the history\r\nof English Charters, we shall examine the facts of this period\r\nonly under the first point of view: when we come to treat of the\r\nformation of the Parliament, we shall search there for the first\r\nattempts after an organized constitution.\r\n\r\n{320}\r\n\r\n         First Charter Of Henry III.\r\n\r\nHenry, who was but a child when his father died, found an able\r\nprotector in William, Earl of Pembroke, Marshal of England, who\r\nwas then commander of the royal armies. Pembroke had been a\r\nfaithful servant to King John, and transferred to the son that\r\nfriendship which he had given to the father. His only thought was\r\nthat Henry should succeed to the throne, and accordingly the\r\nceremony of coronation was performed at Gloucester, on the 28th\r\nof October, 1216. Afterwards, in a council of barons assembled at\r\nBristol, on the 11th of November, he assumed the title of Regent,\r\nand in order to render the cause of the young king popular he\r\ngranted a new charter in his--the king's--name. This charter\r\ncorresponded, with the exception of a few modifications, to that\r\ngiven by King John. All the articles are omitted which refer to\r\nthe establishment of _escuages_, to the liberty of entering\r\nand leaving the kingdom, to the preservation of forests and\r\ndykes, and to the customs of the counties; moreover, the article\r\nwas suppressed which granted the right of resistance by armed\r\nforce in case the king should violate his promises. These\r\nsuppressions were not, however, definitely concluded; it is\r\nstated in the charter that \"the prelates and lords have\r\ndetermined that these things shall remain open, until they have\r\nmore fully deliberated concerning them.\" [Footnote 20]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 20: The original of this charter still exists in\r\n    the archives of Durham Cathedral.]\r\n\r\nWe see by this that the barons at that time showed themselves\r\nless exacting than they had been during John's reign, or rather\r\nthat they no longer stipulated for any other interests than those\r\nwhich personally affected themselves, neglecting those belonging\r\nto other classes in the nation.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, this new charter produced the effect which\r\nPembroke had desired; it finally broke up the party which had\r\nbeen formed in favour of Prince Louis of France, and strengthened\r\nthat of King Henry. The French, however, had still some adherents\r\nleft; the city of London especially persisted, with an obstinate\r\ndetermination, in remaining faithful to them. But after numerous\r\nreverses, they could hold out no longer; a treaty was concluded\r\nbetween the two monarchs on the 11th of September, 1217; Louis\r\nabandoned all pretensions to the crown, left England with the\r\nremnant of his party, and Henry remained in quiet possession of\r\nthe sovereignty.\r\n\r\n{321}\r\n\r\nThe retreat of the French re-established harmony in the kingdom,\r\nbut in order to render the concord more certain and immediate two\r\nmore charters were granted. One was similar to the preceding;\r\nonly one remarkable modification is to be found, namely the\r\ndecision that the escuage should be levied as in the time of\r\nHenry II. The other is known under the name of the Charta de\r\nForestâ, being the same that has been erroneously attributed to\r\nKing John: it has only one special aim, and contains nothing but\r\na series of regulations as to the extent and limits of the\r\nforests belonging either to the nobility or to the crown.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Violation Of The Charters.\r\n\r\nThese charters were perpetually violated by the agents of power.\r\nFor several years these infractions did not occasion more than\r\npartial complaints, but at length, in the year 1223, the\r\nprotestation became general and urgent. The council of barons was\r\nsummoned to London, where they demanded a new confirmation of the\r\ncharters. One of the councillors of the regency, William de\r\nBriwere, ventured to oppose, saying that \"all these liberties had\r\nbeen extorted from the king;\" but the Archbishop of Canterbury\r\nsmartly reproved him, telling him that if he loved the king, he\r\nat all events would not venture to trouble the kingdom. The young\r\nking promised that the charters should be henceforth observed,\r\nand twelve knights were appointed in each county, who should\r\nenquire what were, according to ancient usages, the rights of the\r\nking and the liberties of his subjects.\r\n\r\nStill, new anxieties soon excited new protestations. Since the\r\npreceding reign the barons had held in trust most of the royal\r\ncastles and domains, and this was the principal guarantee they\r\nhad that their treaties should be observed. Suddenly their\r\npossession of this guarantee was threatened: a bull of Pope\r\nHonorius III., which declared Henry to be of age when he was\r\nseventeen years old, ordered at the same time that all those who\r\nhad royal domains in their hands should restore them to the king.\r\nThis bull occasioned many suspicions as to Henry's intentions;\r\nfears began to be entertained lest, having obtained his majority,\r\nhe should revoke the two charters to which he had sworn during\r\nhis minority. The king and his advisers perceived the necessity\r\nof meeting this disturbed state of feeling, and on the 11th of\r\nFebruary, 1225, the king granted of his own accord a new\r\nconfirmation of the charters. As an acknowledgment of this they\r\ngranted him a fifteenth part of all the moveable property of the\r\nkingdom as a subsidy.\r\n\r\n{322}\r\n\r\n         Revocation Of The Charters.\r\n\r\nBut this mutual accommodation did not last long. At the end of\r\ntwo years, Henry, having obtained his true majority, revoked all\r\nthe charters, under the pretext that they had been granted when\r\nhe was not in the free possession of his body and of his seal;\r\n\"_cum nee sui corporis nee sigilli aliquam potestatem\r\nhabuerit_.\"\r\n\r\nThis revocation excited the most active discontent. The indignant\r\nbarons turned their rage against the man whom the public voice\r\naccused as the author of these proceedings. This was Hubert de\r\nBurgh, the grand justiciary and intimate counsellor of Henry.\r\nThis minister was from that time exposed to the most violent\r\nattacks, and did not cease to be persecuted by the rage of his\r\nopponents till at length, in 1232, the king yielded to the storm,\r\nwithdrew his favour from the obnoxious minister, and exiled him\r\nfrom the court.\r\n\r\nThe murmurs of the barons were hardly appeased when Henry seemed\r\nas if desirous of exciting them afresh, by again surrounding\r\nhimself with men who were hated by his subjects. This was a\r\nforeigner, a Poitevin, Peter des Roches, Bishop of Winchester,\r\nwho became the king's favourite on the disgrace of Hubert de\r\nBurgh. From that time, only foreigners were trusted with places\r\nand favours by the prince. Not content with draining the coffers\r\nof the State, they burdened the people with exactions,--their\r\ninsolence was perfectly unbridled. When the laws of England were\r\nappealed to against them, \"we are not English,\" they said, \"we do\r\nnot know what is the purport of these laws.\" The indignant barons\r\nurgently demanded justice, and in the year 1234, two years after\r\nthe disgrace of Hubert de Burgh, the king found himself compelled\r\nto abandon Peter des Roches and to dismiss the foreigners from\r\nhis court. But shortly after, on his marriage with Eleanor,\r\ndaughter of the Count of Provence, the Provençals took the place\r\nof the Poitevins, and in their turn drew on themselves the hatred\r\nof the English barons.\r\n\r\n{323}\r\n\r\n         Conformation Of The Charters.\r\n\r\nThe irritation was general, when the king, who was in want of\r\nmoney, assembled the barons at Westminster, in the month of\r\nJanuary, 1237, in order to demand of them a subsidy. The barons\r\nanswered him with a refusal and with menaces. Henry, alarmed at\r\nthis, had recourse to a remedy which had not yet lost its\r\nefficiency, namely, a new confirmation of the charters. Hardly\r\nwas it granted before he obtained a subsidy of a thirtieth part\r\nof all moveable property.\r\n\r\nBut his prodigality soon dissipated these feeble resources; again\r\nwas he obliged to resort to arbitrary and tyrannical means in\r\norder to provide himself with money,--to exactions, to forced\r\nloans, a new kind of impost which is then for the first time to\r\nbe met with in English history. It is remarkable, however, that\r\nHenry never dared to levy any general tribute on the nation on\r\nhis own personal responsibility. Imposts that were really public\r\nwere never collected except under the professed sanction of a\r\ncouncil of the barons, and after the king had purchased their\r\ngood will by a new confirmation of the charters.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of May, 1253, a sentence of excommunication was\r\nsolemnly pronounced against any person who should infringe the\r\nroyal charters; and at the close of the ceremony the prelates\r\nthrew down their extinguished but smoking tapers, exclaiming,\r\n\"May the soul of every one who incurs this sentence so stink and\r\nbe extinguished in hell!\" And the king added, \"So help me God! I\r\nwill keep these charters inviolate, as I am a man, as I am a\r\nChristian, as I am a knight, and as I am a king crowned and\r\nanointed!\"\r\n\r\nAgain were the charters violated, and at length it was seen that\r\ntheir repeated renewals were vain,--civil war was therefore\r\ndeclared. The Earl of Leicester, at the head of a party of\r\nbarons, took up arms, at first with the intention of effectually\r\nlimiting, but afterwards of entirely usurping the royal\r\nauthority. This rebellion had now no longer for its aim to obtain\r\nthe renewal of charters, it tended also to found practical\r\nguarantees of recognized rights. Of these I shall speak more in\r\ndetail when I come to consider the formation of the Parliament.\r\nAt present I will content myself with observing that the result\r\nof the insurrection headed by the Earl of Leicester was a general\r\nrenewal of the charters, granted on the 14th of March, 1264,--a\r\nkind of treaty of peace between the king and the barons, the\r\nking's object being to obtain from them the enlargement of Prince\r\nEdward, whom they retained as a hostage.\r\n\r\n{324}\r\n\r\n         Death Of King Henry III.\r\n\r\nAt length, three years after, on the 18th of November, 1267, some\r\ntime before the departure of Prince Edward for Palestine, the\r\nking once more confirmed the charters in the Parliament assembled\r\nat Marlborough. This confirmation was the last granted by Henry\r\nIII.; he died five years afterwards, on the 16th of November,\r\n1272, having passed a long reign in making promises to be\r\nafterwards violated, renewed, retracted, and then renewed again.\r\n\r\n{325}\r\n\r\n              Lecture IX.\r\n\r\n  Conclusion of the history of Charters under the reign of Edward I.\r\n\r\n  Political conflict follows civil war.\r\n\r\n  The king frequently violates the Charters, especially in the\r\n  matter of imposts.\r\n\r\n  The barons resist energetically.\r\n\r\n  Edward gives a definitive confirmation to the Charters\r\n  (1298-1301).\r\n\r\n  A bull of Clement V., solicited by Edward I., annuls the\r\n  Charters.\r\n\r\n  Its failure.\r\n\r\n  Death of Edward I. (July 7, 1307)\r\n\r\n\r\n         Reign Of King Edward I.\r\n\r\nDuring the two preceding reigns the struggle between the feudal\r\naristocracy and the royal power has been really a civil war.\r\nUnder Edward I. the struggle continued, but the civil war ceased.\r\nThe barons did not protest in favour of their liberty with any\r\nless resolute determination than they had hitherto manifested,\r\nnor did the king defend his prerogatives less vigorously, but\r\nneither party appealed to arms. This is the general history of\r\nimportant struggles; they are begun by a trial of strength\r\nbetween the two contending parties, and when the problem of\r\nmaterial forces has been resolved, the struggle changes its\r\ndirection and its theatre; it becomes concentrated into an\r\nassembly, and the victorious party has no longer any other aim\r\nthan to legalize the victory already gained, and thus add a\r\nconstitutional validity to a material victory. Parliamentary\r\ndebates follow civil war. When the parliamentary debates have\r\nlasted through a certain number of years, and have received the\r\nsanction of time, the struggle may be regarded as terminated. To\r\nthis stage had matters arrived in the reign of Edward I.; the\r\nresistance which was shewn during his reign only displayed itself\r\nin Parliament; and, when it had lasted for thirty years, the\r\nrights which it had tended to consecrate were for ever recognized\r\nand tolerably respected.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Henry's death, his son Edward was in Palestine;\r\nnotwithstanding his absence, however, he was proclaimed king\r\nwithout any opposition. The capacity which he had displayed in\r\nthe troubles of the kingdom, and the moderation which he had\r\noften shewn, had gained for him general favour.\r\n{326}\r\nUpon his return to England, he justified the expectations which\r\nhad been formed concerning him; many abuses were reformed, and a\r\nbetter order was introduced into the administration of justice.\r\n\r\nI shall pass rapidly over the first twenty-four years of this\r\nreign. They were occupied with the conquest of Wales, and with\r\nEdward's wars in Scotland, which were incessantly renewed by the\r\ninsurrections of the Scotch. During all this time, although we\r\nhear of very frequent assemblies of Parliament, we scarcely hear\r\nanything even of the charters. The administration of the kingdom,\r\nwhich was vigorous and fair, excited few complaints, and public\r\nattention was absorbed by the expeditions and victories of the\r\nmonarch.\r\n\r\n\r\n             Exactions Of Edward I.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the necessity of frequently raising subsidies, in\r\norder to keep up his numerous armies, soon obliged Edward to\r\nadopt violent and arbitrary measures. He limited the quantity of\r\nwool which might be exported, and placed on every sack of wool,\r\nthat was exported, a duty of forty shillings, that is to say,\r\nmore than a third of its value; all the rest of the wool and\r\nhides, that were ready for shipping, were confiscated to the\r\nservice of the king. He demanded of each sheriff two thousand\r\nquarters of wheat, and as many of oats, authorising them to take\r\nthe required wheat or oats wherever they could lay their hands\r\nupon them; besides which he caused a large quantity of cattle to\r\nbe seized. Lastly, showing no regard for feudal right, he imposed\r\non every landed proprietor, having a larger revenue than twenty\r\npounds sterling, whatever might be the nature of his domains, the\r\nobligation to attend him in the war which he was about to\r\nprosecute in France.\r\n\r\nThe dissatisfaction among the people and barons was general, and\r\nit was soon redoubled, in consequence of a fraud to which Edward\r\ndid not hesitate to resort in raising a subsidy, which had been\r\ngranted to him by the Parliament, held at Saint Edmundsbury in\r\nthe preceding year (1296.) Instead of contenting himself with the\r\neighth [Footnote 21] of the moveable property, which had been\r\ngranted to him, he assumed that the impost was much larger, and\r\nobliged his subjects to pay it.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 21: An eighth, a tenth, &c. was a money tax levied\r\n    on counties, cities, boroughs, or other towns, and so called\r\n    because it was the eighth, tenth, &c. of the sum at which\r\n    these counties, towns, &c. had been anciently valued under\r\n    the reign of William I. Thus each town knew what it had to\r\n    contribute. The valuations were contained in the Doomsday\r\n    Book. (_Parliam. Hist._, vol. i. p. 83.)]\r\n\r\n{327}\r\n\r\n         Quarrels With The Nobles.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the excitement caused by these measures, Edward\r\nconvoked his barons at Salisbury to arrange with them for the\r\ndeparture and march of his armies. He had intended to send one of\r\nhis armies to Gascony, and to lead the other into Flanders,\r\nhimself taking the command of the latter in person, while the\r\nformer was to march under the direction of Humphrey Bohun, Earl\r\nof Hereford, and of Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, the one the\r\nConstable, the other the Lord Marshal of England. These two men,\r\nwho were vigorous champions of the national cause, refused to\r\naccept the mission which was offered to them. The object of their\r\nrefusal was to compel the king to purchase their compliance by a\r\nrenewed promise to confirm the charters, a promise which he had\r\nalready made, but which he seemed in no haste to carry out. When\r\nEdward gave them the order to repair to Gascony, they answered\r\nthat they were ready to follow him to Flanders, but that the\r\ncharacter of their offices would not allow them to separate\r\nthemselves from his person. \"You shall go,\" said the king,\r\n\"whether I go with you or not.\" Hereford replied that he would\r\nnot go; upon which Edward exclaimed, \"By the everlasting God, sir\r\nearl, you shall either go or hang.\" \"By the everlasting God, sir\r\nking,\" replied Hereford, coolly, \"I will neither go nor hang.\"\r\nEdward did not feel himself sufficiently powerful to punish this\r\nhaughty reply; and, fearing lest he should find the same spirit\r\nof resistance in all the barons, he abandoned his intention of\r\nsending an army into Gascony. The two earls quitted Salisbury\r\nwith their retinue, and the king, after he had placed their\r\noffices in the hands of two other lords, prepared to embark for\r\nFlanders.\r\n\r\nBut before his departure, on the 12th of August, 1297, he\r\naddressed to all the sheriffs of the kingdom a singular kind of\r\nmanifesto, one which was, perhaps, unique at that period, which\r\nhe intended should be read before the assembled people. In it the\r\nking explained the causes of his quarrel with the two earls,\r\nexcused the exactions he had made by pleading the necessities of\r\nwar, and desired his subjects to maintain peace and order. This\r\nproclamation, or, perhaps, rather this appeal to the public,\r\nshows how greatly power already felt itself dependent upon the\r\nsupport of opinion, and constrained in some way to acknowledge a\r\nresponsibility to it.\r\n\r\n{328}\r\n\r\n          First Charter Of Edward I.\r\n\r\nTo this apology for his conduct, which the king put forth, the\r\nEarls of Norfolk and Hereford replied by another manifesto, which\r\nwas presented to the king at Winchelsea, in which they recounted\r\nall the public wrongs and demanded redress. Edward answered that\r\nhis council was dispersed, and that he could not attend to these\r\nprotests till his return, and he accordingly went on his\r\nexpedition, leaving his son regent of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nUpon this the two earls, after having published their manifesto\r\nand the king's reply to it, presented themselves before the\r\ntreasurers and barons of the exchequer, and forbade them, as they\r\nwould dread to excite a civil war, to collect, for the king, the\r\ntribute of one-eighth, which had been granted by the Parliament\r\nat Saint Edmundsbury, affirming that the granting of it had been\r\nillegal.\r\n\r\nIn order to bring these differences to a close, the prince-regent\r\nassembled a Parliament in London, on the 10th of October, 1297.\r\nThe two earls were invited to take their place in the assembly,\r\nand came escorted by five hundred horse and a body of infantry,\r\nand would not consent to enter London until they had obtained\r\npermission to place a guard at each gate. They demanded a general\r\nconfirmation of the charters, and, moreover, asked that several\r\nadditions should be made to them. The prince-regent subscribed to\r\nall their demands, and the act of confirmation signed by him was\r\nimmediately sent to the king, who was at Ghent. Edward, after he\r\nhad taken three days to consider the matter, sanctioned the\r\nconfirmation, [Footnote 22] and granted an amnesty to the two\r\nearls, who, satisfied with this exhibition of generosity on the\r\npart of the king, went, subsequently, to Scotland to assist him\r\nin the war which he was carrying on there.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 22: A copy of this charter will be found, in a\r\n    note, at the end of this lecture. It is of all others the\r\n    most explicit in favour of public liberties. It was given at\r\n    Ghent, Nov, 5, 1298; the original is preserved in the British\r\n    Museum.]\r\n\r\n{329}\r\n\r\n         Confirmation Of The Charter.\r\n\r\nWhen Edward returned again to England, the barons demanded that\r\nhe, in his own person, should confirm the charters which had been\r\ngranted to them. The king evaded these demands, and retired to\r\nWindsor. Thither the barons followed him to renew their\r\nimportunities and their complaints. The king excused himself on\r\nthe ground of ill-health, and told them to return to London,\r\nwhere he would send them an answer. This answer was a new\r\nconfirmation of the charters, but contained one restrictive\r\nclause: _salvo jure coronæ nostræ_. At the public reading of\r\nthe charter, which was made at St. Paul's Cathedral, the assembly\r\nhearing how all their rights were definitely confirmed in it,\r\nmade the most lively manifestations of joy; but hardly had the\r\nreserve clause been pronounced, when violent murmurs were raised\r\non all sides; the people immediately left the church, and the\r\nangry barons retired to their domains, resolved once more to\r\nappeal to force.\r\n\r\nEdward perceived that he had raised a storm of opinion against\r\nhim, and, after innumerable delays and evasions, and complaining\r\nhaughtily that he was too closely pressed, he, at length, decided\r\nupon convoking a Parliament on the 6th of March, 1300, and\r\nconfirmed without any restriction all the concessions which he\r\nhad already made; he even added new guarantees, which were\r\ncontained in articles called _articuli super chartas_. The\r\nchief provisions contained in these additions consist in a\r\nregulation that the charters should be publicly read in the\r\ncounty courts four times every year, and that there should be\r\nelected in each county court, from among the knights of the\r\ncourt, three justices, sworn to receive all complaints of\r\ninfractions of the charters, and to pronounce penalties against\r\nthe offenders.\r\n\r\nLastly, in the following year, 1301, at a Parliament held at\r\nLincoln, Edward, after having received its approval to a new\r\nlimitation of the forests, which had been for a long time\r\ndemanded and at length concluded, yet once more confirmed the\r\ncharters.\r\n\r\nFrom the time when this charter of confirmation was granted, the\r\nrights which it proclaimed were definitively recognized. The open\r\nand exterior struggle ceased at this period, but the secret and\r\nconcealed did not. Edward endured impatiently the yoke which he\r\nhad taken upon himself, and endeavoured to release himself from\r\nit. He did not, however, dare to raise the mask, but concealed\r\nall his efforts.\r\n{330}\r\nTowards the close of the year 1304, he petitioned Pope Clement V.\r\nto release him from his oaths. The pontiff complied with his\r\nwishes, and by a bull, dated January 5, 1305, declared that all\r\nthe promises and concessions made by Edward were _abrogated,\r\nnull and void_. [Footnote 23]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 23: A copy of this bull will be found in a note at\r\n    the end of this lecture.]\r\n\r\nThis prince did not dare, as John had formerly done, to take\r\nadvantage of this bull, and he therefore kept it quite secret;\r\nbut he still had recourse to secret manœuvres. He began by a\r\nseries of vile persecutions of those who had headed the\r\nconfederation of the barons, and especially of the Earl of\r\nNorfolk and the Archbishop of Canterbury. These two men, though\r\nthey were in former years so boldly courageous, now yielded with\r\na feebleness that can only be excused by their great age. But it\r\nwas too late; the authority of the king could no longer effect\r\nanything against the charters, and the feebleness even of their\r\nformer defenders could not add to the power of royalty. Death\r\nsoon after put a stop to all Edward's efforts to carry out the\r\ndesigns he had formed: it surprised him suddenly while he was in\r\nScotland, on the 7th of July, 1307. From that period the\r\ncharters, notwithstanding all attacks made upon them, have\r\nremained as the immoveable basis of public right in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n          Statute Of Edward I.\r\n\r\n  _Statute issued by Edward I., in confirmation of the\r\n  Charters. November_ 5, 1297.\r\n\r\nEdward, by the grace of God, King of England, Lord of Ireland,\r\nand Duke of Guyan, to all those that these present letters shall\r\nhear or see, greeting. Know ye that we, to the honour of God and\r\nof Holy Church, and to the profit of our realm, have granted\r\nthat, for us and for our heirs, the charter of liberties and the\r\ncharter of the forest, which were made by common consent of all\r\nthe realm, in the time of King Henry our father, shall be kept in\r\nevery point without breach. And we will that the same charters\r\nshall be sent under our seal, as well to our justices of the\r\nforest as to others, and to all sheriffs of shires, and to all\r\nour other officers, and to all our cities throughout the realm,\r\ntogether with our writs in the which it shall be contained; that\r\nthey cause the aforesaid charters to be published, and declare to\r\nthe people that we have confirmed them in all points; and that\r\nour justices, sheriffs, and mayors, and other ministers, which,\r\nunder us, have the laws of our land to guide, shall allow the\r\nsaid charters, pleaded before them in judgment, in all their\r\npoints, that is to wit, the Great Charter as the common law, and\r\nthe charter of the forest for the wealth of our realm.\r\n\r\n{331}\r\n\r\nAnd we will that if any judgment be given from henceforth\r\ncontrary to the points on the charters aforesaid by the justices,\r\nor by any other our ministers, that hold pleas before them\r\nagainst the points of the charters, it shall be undone and holden\r\nfor nought.\r\n\r\nAnd we will that the same charters shall be sent, under our seal,\r\nto cathedral churches throughout our realm, there to remain, and\r\nshall be read before the people two times by the year.\r\n\r\nAnd all archbishops and bishops shall pronounce the sentence of\r\nexcommunication against all those that by word, deed, or counsel\r\ndo contrary to the foresaid charters, or that in any point break,\r\nor undo them. And that the said curses be twice a year denounced\r\nand published, by the prelates aforesaid. And if the same\r\nprelates, or any of them, be remiss in the denunciation of the\r\nsaid sentences, the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, for the\r\ntime being, shall compel and distrain them to the execution of\r\ntheir duties in form aforesaid:\r\n\r\nAnd foresomuch as divers people of our realm are in fear that the\r\naids and tasks which they have given us beforetime towards our\r\nwars, and other business, of their own grant and goodwill,\r\nhowsoever they were made, might turn to a bondage to them and\r\ntheir heirs, because they might be at another time found in the\r\nRolls, and likewise for the prises taken throughout the realm by\r\nour ministers, we have granted for us and for our heirs, that we\r\nwill not draw such aids, tasks, nor prises into a custom, for any\r\nthing that hath been done heretofore, be it by Roll or any other\r\nprecedent that may be found.\r\n\r\nMoreover we have granted for us and for our heirs, as well to\r\narchbishops, bishops, abbots, priors, and other folk of Holy\r\nChurch, as also to earls, barons, and all the commonality of the\r\nland, that for no business for henceforth we shall take such\r\nmanner of aids, tasks, or prises, but by the common assent of the\r\nrealm, and for the common profit thereof, saving the ancient aids\r\nand prises due and accustomed.\r\n\r\nAnd foresomuch as the more part of the commonality of this realm\r\nfind themselves sore grieved with the maletent of wool, that is\r\nto wit, a toll of forty shillings for every sack of wool, and\r\nhave made petition for us to release the same; we, at their\r\nrequests, have clearly released it, and have granted, for us and\r\nour heirs, that we shall not take such things without their\r\ncommon consent and goodwill; saving to us and our heirs the\r\ncustom of wools, skins, and leather, granted before by the\r\ncommonality aforesaid. In witness of which things we have caused\r\nthese our letters to be made patents. Witness, Edward, our son,\r\nat London, the 10th day of October, the five and twentieth year\r\nof our reign.\r\n\r\nAnd be it remembered that this same charter, in the same terms,\r\nword for word, was sealed in Flanders, under the king's great\r\nseal, that is to say, at Ghent, the 5th day of November, in the\r\ntwenty-fifth year of the reign of our aforesaid lord the king,\r\nand sent into England.\r\n\r\n{332}\r\n\r\n         Bull Of Pope Clement V.\r\n\r\n        _Letter of Clement V. to Edward I._\r\n\r\nClement, bishop, servant of God's servants, to our well-beloved\r\nson in Jesus Christ, Edward, illustrious king of England, health\r\nand apostolic benediction:\r\n\r\nThe purity of thy loyal devotion, which is and has been uniform\r\nand conspicuous in thy unwearied attention to the desires of the\r\nHoly See, well deserves that the Holy See itself should remove\r\nall that is hostile to thy welfare, should suppress whatever\r\ndispleases thee, and should ever secure for thee the enjoyment of\r\nall good.\r\n\r\nWe have learnt recently, by an account worthy of credit, that\r\nlately, when thou wert in Flanders, and even before thy arrival\r\nthere, when thy efforts were being used to maintain thy\r\nprerogatives against thy enemies and rivals, that then certain\r\nmagnates and nobles of thy kingdom, and other persons who are\r\nhostile to thy authority, taking advantage of the opportunity\r\nwhen thou wert occupied in fighting against those in another\r\nkingdom, who were opposed to thy rule, threatened that, unless\r\nthou wouldst make certain concessions of a diverse and unjust\r\ncharacter, both relating to forest and other rights, which have,\r\nfrom time immemorial, belonged to the crown, and the dignity of\r\nthy rank, (which also, previously, they had importunately sought\r\nbefore thy departure from the said kingdom,) they would conspire\r\nagainst thee, would excite the people, and disseminate various\r\nscandals:\r\n\r\nAnd that thou, prudently treating their conspiracy, and wishing\r\nthen to avoid the dangers that were pressing upon thee, didst\r\ngrant these concessions, more by constraint than with thy free\r\nconsent:\r\n\r\nAnd that, finally, on thy return to thy kingdom, the wars not\r\nhaving then terminated, the said magnates, and others, through\r\ntheir importunate and presumptuous suggestions, did obtain from\r\nthee the renewal of these concessions; and that they have,\r\nmoreover, extorted royal orders to the effect that in every\r\ncathedral church in the kingdom there should be pronounced, twice\r\nevery year, a sentence of excommunication against those who\r\nshould violate the said concessions, as is expounded formally and\r\nin detail in the said commands, under the authority of the royal\r\nseal:\r\n\r\nAs, therefore, the Holy Apostolic See regards thy kingdom\r\nfavourably, even above all other kingdoms, and entertains for\r\nthee, personally, the most friendly feelings, and recognizes that\r\nall these concessions have been made and extorted at the expense\r\nof thine honour, and to the detriment of thy royal sovereignty:\r\n\r\nSo by the apostolic authority, and by our full power, we revoke,\r\nannul, and dissolve the said concessions and all their effects,\r\nand all that can result from them, as also the sentences of\r\nexcommunication which have or may be pronounced in order to their\r\nobservance, either in the said churches or elsewhere, we declare\r\nthem abolished, null, and without authority; annulling also the\r\norders and letters to which they have given occasion; we decree\r\nfor thee and for thy successors on the throne of England, that ye\r\nneither are nor ever shall be bound to observe them, even\r\nalthough ye may have engaged yourselves so by oath; besides that,\r\nas thou hast assured us, at the time when thy coronation was\r\nsolemnized, thou didst swear to maintain the honours and the\r\nprerogatives of thy crown; so that, if even thou hast bound\r\nthyself to any penalty on this account, we absolve thee\r\ntherefrom, as well as from the accusation of perjury if it should\r\nbe made against thee.\r\n\r\n{333}\r\n\r\nTo ensure the execution of our desires, we expressly forbid our\r\nvenerable brethren, the archbishops, bishops, and others,\r\necclesiastical as well as secular, who are settled in thy\r\nkingdom, to do or attempt anything against the tenor of the\r\npresent annulment, abrogation, revocation, and abolition, under\r\npenalty, as regards the archbishops and bishops, of suspension\r\nfrom their offices and benefices; and, if they persist for one\r\nmonth, under penalty of excommunication, which shall be, for this\r\nsole reason, pronounced against them, and all who are accessory\r\nto their designs.\r\n\r\nWe declare beforehand that every attempt against our present\r\ndecree is null and void.\r\n\r\nIf, however, there is any right belonging to the inhabitants of\r\nthe said kingdom, which they possess by virtue of previous\r\nletters and concessions so made by thee, we mean not to withdraw\r\nthese from them.\r\n\r\nIt shall not be allowed to any one absolutely to violate in any\r\nparticular, or only to contradict the present act of abrogation,\r\nrevocation, annulment, and abolition.\r\n\r\nIf any one dare to allow this in himself let him know that he\r\nincurs the indignation of the Almighty, and of the blessed\r\napostles Peter and Paul.

We have, however, now arrived at the point when this\r\ngovernment began to appear. Our attention is now to be called to\r\nthe creation of a Parliament, that is to say, to the birth of a\r\nrepresentative system.\r\n\r\nAs we approach this great historical question, a question in\r\npolitical philosophy presents itself before us:--what is the true\r\nand legitimate sense of this word _representation_ as\r\napplied to the government of a community? It is not for us to\r\npass over this question without noticing it: the history of\r\npolitical institutions is now no longer a bare recital of facts,\r\n--it must rest on principles;--it neither deserves the name nor\r\npossesses the authority of science, till it has sounded and\r\nplaced in clear light the primary foundation in reason, from\r\nwhich the facts which it collects trace their origin. Political\r\nhistory cannot now be otherwise than philosophical; this is\r\ndemanded by the stage of human culture which the mind of society\r\nhas reached.\r\n\r\n{335}\r\n\r\n         Rousseau's Theory.\r\n\r\nLet us now suppose a representative government, aristocratic or\r\ndemocratic, monarchical or republican, completely established and\r\nin action: if any one were to ask a citizen of such a\r\nState,--supposing him to be a man of good sense but unversed in\r\npolitical speculations,--\"Why do you elect such a deputy?\" he\r\nwould answer, \"Because in the consideration of public affairs, I\r\nbelieve him to be more capable than any other of sustaining the\r\ncause to which my opinions, my feelings, my interests, are\r\nallied.\"\r\n\r\nNow bring this man before the political theorists who have\r\ntreated of representation; let his good sense be brought into\r\ncontact with their systems;--truth would soon be perplexed and\r\nobscured by the falsities of science.\r\n\r\nOne learned gentleman would thus address him:--\"What have you\r\ndone? You have supplied yourself with a representative,--you are\r\nno longer free,--you are no longer in truth a citizen of a free\r\nState. Liberty means a man's sovereignty over himself, the right\r\nto be governed only by his individual will. And sovereignty\r\ncannot be represented, just because the will cannot be\r\nrepresented--it is either the same or something entirely\r\ndifferent, there is no medium. Who has certified you that your\r\nrepresentative will always and on all occasions have the same\r\nwill as yourself? He will certainly not be so accommodating. So\r\nfar then from your being represented, you have surrendered to him\r\nyour will, your sovereignty, your liberty. You have given\r\nyourself up not to a representative, but to a master. And why?\r\nBecause you are an indolent, grasping, cowardly individual, who\r\npay far more regard to your own personal concerns than to public\r\nmatters, who will rather pay for soldiers than go to war, who\r\nwill rather appoint deputies and stay at home than go yourself\r\nand share in the deliberations of a national council.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the way in which Rousseau conceives of representation: he\r\nconsiders that it is delusive and impossible, and that every\r\nrepresentative government is in its own nature illegitimate.\r\n[Footnote 24]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 24: _Du Contrat Social_, b. iii. c. xv.]\r\n\r\n\r\n         Theory Of Individual Sovereignty.\r\n\r\nLet the same citizen be addressed by other doctors who,\r\nentertaining the same ideas of sovereignty and liberty as those\r\nheld by Rousseau, and nevertheless believing in representation,\r\nendeavour to harmonize these different conceptions. They might\r\nsay to him: \"Most true; sovereignty resides in yourself and in\r\nyourself alone; but you may delegate without abandoning it;--you\r\ndo so every day; to your steward you commit the management of\r\nyour lands, to your physician the care of your health, and you\r\nplace your legal affairs into the hands of your solicitor.\r\n{336}\r\nLife is vast and complicated, your personal control is\r\ninsufficient for all its activity and demands; everywhere you\r\navail yourself of others in the exercise of your own power--you\r\nemploy servants. This is only a new application of the same\r\nprinciple--you employ one servant more. If he swerve from your\r\ndirections, if he fail in giving expression to your will, we\r\ngrant that he abuses his trust. When you give him your suffrage,\r\nyou do not surrender to him your liberty--he on the other hand in\r\nreceiving them has renounced his own. The mandate which he holds\r\nfrom you makes him a slave while it makes you free. On this\r\ncondition representation becomes legitimate, for the person\r\nrepresented does not cease to be sovereign.\"\r\n\r\nWhat will the citizen say to this? He must make his choice: such,\r\nhe is told, is the nature of representation that, in one way or\r\nanother, whenever he appoints a deputy he makes some one a slave,\r\neither his representative or himself. This was far from his\r\nintention; wishing to live at once in freedom and in security, he\r\nconnected himself, acting in concert with his fellow citizens,\r\nwith a man whom he regarded free as well as himself, and whom he\r\njudged capable of defending his liberty and ensuring his\r\ntranquillity; when he gave this man his suffrage he did not\r\nbelieve he was either enslaving himself or the object of his\r\nchoice;--he thought to enter into a relation of alliance with\r\nhim, not of sovereignty or of servitude;--he only did what is\r\nvirtually done every day by men, who, having interests which are\r\nidentical and not being able to manage them individually and\r\ndirectly, entrust them to that individual among their number who\r\nappears to be most capable of efficiently conducting them, thus\r\nshewing by their confidence their respect for his superiority,\r\nand preserving at the same time the right to judge, by his\r\nconduct, if the superiority is real and the confidence deserved.\r\nRegarded in itself, this is the fact of election,--neither more\r\nnor less. What then is to be said of the theory which comes to\r\ndenaturalize the fact, and to give it an import and significance\r\nwhich it never had in its origin either in the intention or the\r\nreason of the parties interested.\r\n\r\n{337}\r\n\r\n         Consequences Of These Theories.\r\n\r\nThe source of all this confusion is to be found in a wrong\r\napprehension of the word _representation_; and the word has\r\nbeen misunderstood, because false ideas have been entertained\r\nregarding sovereignty and liberty. We must therefore revert to\r\nearlier stages of the enquiry.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental principle of the philosophies which we oppose is,\r\nthat every man is his own absolute master, that the only\r\nlegitimate law for him is his individual will; at no time had any\r\none, be his credentials what they may, any right over him, if he\r\ndoes not give his consent to it. Starting from this principle,\r\nRousseau saw, and saw truly, that as the will is a purely\r\nindividual fact, so all representation of the will is impossible.\r\nAssuming that the will is the sole source of the legitimate power\r\nwhich a man exercises over himself, it follows that no man can\r\ntransmit this power to another, for he cannot determine that his\r\nwill shall be conveyed to another man and cease to reside in\r\nhimself. He cannot confer a power which would certainly involve\r\nthe risk of his being obliged to obey another will than his own;\r\nfor on this very account, if on no other, that power would be\r\nillegitimate. All thought of representation, therefore, is a\r\ndelusion, and all power founded on representation is tyrannical,\r\nfor a man only remains free so long as he obeys no law but that\r\nof his own will.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion is inevitable,--Rousseau's only fault was that he\r\ndid not push it far enough. Going as far as this would lead him,\r\nhe would have entirely abstained from seeking after the best\r\ngovernment, he would have condemned all constitutions--he would\r\nhave affirmed the illegitimacy of all law and all power. In fact,\r\nhow does it concern me that a law emanated yesterday from my\r\nwill, if to-day my will has changed? Yesterday my will was the\r\nonly source of legitimacy for the law; why then should the law\r\nremain legitimate when it is no longer sanctioned by my will? Can\r\nI not will more than once? Does my will exhaust its rights by a\r\nsingle act? And because it is my only master, must I, therefore,\r\nsubmit slavishly to laws from which this master who has made them\r\nbids me to enfranchise myself? This was not overlooked by\r\nRousseau: \"It is absurd,\" he says, \"to suppose that the will\r\nshould fetter itself with chains for the future.\" [Footnote 25]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 25: _Du Contrat Social_, b. ii. c. i.]\r\n\r\n{338}\r\n\r\n              Theory Of Reconciliation.\r\n\r\nThis then is the consequence of the principle when fairly carried\r\nout. Rousseau did not see this, or did not dare to see it; it is\r\ndestructive not only of all government, but also of all society.\r\nIt imposes upon man an absolute and continued isolation, does not\r\nallow him to contract any obligations, or to bind himself by any\r\nlaw, and brings an element of dissolution even into the bosom of\r\nthe individual himself, who can no more bind himself to his own\r\nnature than to any other person: for his past will, that is to\r\nsay, what he no longer wills, has no more right over him than the\r\nwill of a stranger.\r\n\r\nRousseau was at least sometimes doubtful as to the application of\r\nhis principle, and he only lost sight of it when, if he had\r\nremained faithful to it, he would have been obliged to sacrifice\r\nall else to it. Minds less powerful than his, and therefore less\r\nable to cast off the yoke of social necessities, have believed\r\nthat they could preserve the principle without admitting all its\r\nconsequences. Like Rousseau, they have admitted that, every man\r\nbeing the sole master of himself, no law can be binding upon him\r\nwhich is not conformed to his will,--an axiom which has become\r\npopular under this form: _No one is bound to obey laws to which\r\nhe has not given his consent_. Reasoning with strict logical\r\nrigour, Rousseau would have perceived that this axiom did not\r\nleave any standing place for organized power. He had, at all\r\nevents, clearly shown that all representation of power was\r\ncondemned by it as illegitimate and delusive. Other political\r\ntheorists have undertaken to deduce from it representation\r\nitself, and all the powers of which it is the basis. They have\r\nproceeded in some such manner as the following:--\r\n\r\nThey have placed themselves fearlessly in presence of existing\r\nfacts, determined to regulate them according to their convenience\r\nby imposing alternately upon the facts a principle which they\r\nreject, and upon this principle consequences which it will not\r\nnaturally admit. Given--society to maintain and government to\r\nconstruct, without ceasing to affirm that the will of man is the\r\nsource of legitimacy for power. It is required that this work\r\nshould follow from this principle--they determine that it shall.\r\n\r\n{339}\r\n\r\n              Representation Of Wills.\r\n\r\nBut an impossibility confronts them at the outset; how to avoid\r\nimposing upon men any law without their consent. How shall all\r\nindividual wills be consulted regarding each particular law?\r\nRousseau did not hesitate; he pronounced great States to be\r\nillegitimate, and that it was necessary to divide society into\r\nsmall republics in order that, once at least, the will of each\r\ncitizen might give its consent to the law. Even if that could be\r\ndone, the problem would be far from being solved, so that the\r\nprinciple should appear fully exemplified, whatever tests might\r\nbe applied to it. But still an impossibility had at length\r\ndisappeared, and logical consistency was preserved. The political\r\ntheorists of whom we are speaking, far more timid than Rousseau,\r\nhave not dared to protest against the existence of large\r\ncommunities, but they have not feared to get over the\r\nimpossibility by the aid of a new inconsistency. While they do\r\nnot allow to individuals the right only to obey laws conformed to\r\ntheir will, they substitute for it the right only to obey laws\r\nwhich emanate from a power which has been constituted by their\r\nwill; they have thought to pay respect to the principle, by\r\nbasing the legitimacy of the law on the election of the\r\nlegislative power. Thus the theory of representation, that is, of\r\nthe representation of wills, has re-appeared, in spite of\r\nRousseau's logical reasonings: for, so long as the will of man is\r\nrecognized as the only legitimate sovereign for him, if the\r\ncreation of a power be attempted by means of representation, the\r\nkind of representation that will really be attempted will be the\r\nrepresentation of wills.\r\n\r\nBut this theory must be carried out, and reduced to practice.\r\nNow, after having annulled, so far as the creation of the law is\r\nconcerned, so many individual wills, the least that could be\r\nexpected is that all should be called upon to give their voice in\r\nthe nomination of those who shall be commissioned to make laws.\r\nUniversal suffrage was therefore the inevitable consequence of\r\nthe principle already so violently perverted; it has been\r\nsometimes professed, but never actually adopted. Here then once\r\nmore a new impossibility has occasioned a new inconsistency.\r\nNowhere has the right of voting for the legislative power\r\nbelonged to more than a fragment of society; women, at least,\r\nhave always been excluded from it. Thus then, while the will has\r\nbeen recognized as the sole legitimate sovereign in every\r\nindividual, a large number of individuals have not even taken any\r\npart in the creation of that factitious sovereignty which\r\nrepresentation has given to all.\r\n\r\n{340}\r\n\r\n         Theory Of Executive Power.\r\n\r\nWe might pursue these investigations, and we should find at every\r\nstep some new deviation from the principle which, it is\r\npretended, is always to be respected as forming the abiding basis\r\non which the formation of governments depends. The most\r\nremarkable of these deviations is certainly the supremacy which\r\nis everywhere attributed to the majority over the minority. Who\r\ndoes not see that, when the principle of the absolute sovereignty\r\nof the individual over himself has been once admitted, this\r\nsupremacy is entirely false? And if false, how is society\r\npossible?\r\n\r\nI have said enough, I think, to shew that this alleged principle\r\nis powerless for the legitimate creation of the government of\r\nsociety, and that it must incessantly yield to necessity, and\r\nfinally vanish altogether. I will now consider it from another\r\npoint of view. I will suppose that the work has been\r\naccomplished, that a government has been constructed; and I\r\ninquire what will be the influence of this principle upon the\r\ngovernment which, it is affirmed, is derived from it, and which\r\nhas only been created by the suffrance of numerous\r\ninconsistencies. What right will the government have over\r\nindividuals, by whose will alone, it is said, it possesses any\r\nlegitimacy? Here, as elsewhere, it is necessary that the\r\nprinciple should again be referred to; it must determine the\r\nright of the government when it has been established, just as it\r\nmust have guided its formation.\r\n\r\nTwo systems present themselves. According to the one, the\r\nindividual wills which have created a legislative power have not\r\nthereby lost their inherent sovereignty; they have provided\r\nthemselves with servants and not with masters; it is true they\r\nhave created this power in order that it may command, but on\r\ncondition that it shall obey. In itself, and in relation to those\r\nfrom whom it holds its commission, it is nothing but a kind of\r\nexecutive power, appointed to put in form the laws which it has\r\nreceived, and constantly subordinated to that other power which\r\nremains diffused among the individuals with whom it originally\r\nresided, and which, although without form and without voice, is\r\nnevertheless the only absolute and permanently legitimate\r\nauthority. In fact, there is a sovereign, which not only does not\r\ngovern, but which obeys, while there is a government which\r\ncommands, but is not sovereign.\r\n\r\n{341}\r\n\r\n              Theory Of Despotic Power.\r\n\r\nAccording to the other system, those individual wills which have\r\ncreated the legislative and central power are, so to speak,\r\nabsorbed into it; they have abdicated in favour of the power\r\nwhich represents them; and it represents them in the whole extent\r\nof their inherent sovereignty. This is, obviously, pure and\r\nunmixed despotism, rigorously deduced from the principle that\r\nwills are to be represented in government, and which has in fact\r\nbeen assumed by all governments which have emanated from this\r\nsource. \"_The elect of the sovereign is itself sovereign:_\"\r\nsuch was the declaration both of the Convention and of Napoleon;\r\nhence the destruction of all responsibility in power, and of all\r\nthe rights belonging to citizens. This certainly was not the\r\nconsummation which the friends of liberty demanded of\r\nrepresentation.\r\n\r\nThe first of these systems is the most plausible, and still\r\npossesses many conscientious advocates. This system is so far\r\ngood, inasmuch as it ignores an inherent right to sovereignty as\r\nthe possession of any government; its error is, that this right\r\nis allowed to exist elsewhere. I do not here examine it in\r\nrelation to any other principle than that from which it professes\r\nto be derived; and if the individual wills which have created the\r\nlegislative power are bound to obey its laws, what becomes of\r\nthis principle? Every man, you say, is free only in so far as he\r\nis left master of his own will. Those then alone will be free in\r\nyour government, who, by a happy coincidence of sentiment with\r\ntheir legislators, approve the laws as thoroughly as if they had\r\nmade them themselves; for whoever is bound to obey laws, whether\r\nhe approve them or not, immediately loses his sovereignty over\r\nhimself, his liberty. And if he has a right to disobey, if the\r\nwill of the legislative power is not authoritative over the wills\r\nwhich have created it, what becomes of this power? What becomes\r\nof government? What becomes of society?\r\n\r\nIt must seem a somewhat superfluous expenditure of logical force\r\nto appeal so often to a principle while power is being gradually\r\nconstructed, when the same principle, if once more appealed to\r\nwhen the business is apparently completed, is found to give a\r\ndeath-blow to this very power. Such, however, must be the result:\r\nfor the principle has disavowed, from the outset, the power which\r\nwas to be deduced from it.\r\n\r\n{342}\r\n         Fallacy Of The Principle\r\n\r\nIf, then, we find that this principle, consistently pursued, can\r\nonly result in the dissolution of society or the formation of a\r\ntyranny,--if it can issue in no legitimate power whatever,--if\r\nit finally lands us, after our inquiries after a free and\r\nreasonable political order, in the alternative of impossibility\r\nor inconsistency,--must we not most evidently seek for the evil\r\nin the principle itself from which we started?\r\n\r\nIt is not true, then, that man is the absolute master of\r\nhimself--that his will is the only legitimate law--that no one,\r\nat any time, under any circumstances, has any right over him\r\nunless he has consented thereto. When philosophers have\r\nconsidered man in himself, apart from all connection with his\r\nfellows, only regarding his active life in its relation to his\r\nown understanding, they have never thought of declaring that his\r\nwill is for him the only legitimate law, or, which amounts to the\r\nsame thing, that every action is just and reasonable merely\r\nbecause it is voluntary. All have recognized that a certain law\r\nwhich is distinct from the individual will encircles him,--a law\r\nwhich is called either reason, morality, or truth, and from which\r\nhe cannot separate his conduct without making the exercise of his\r\nliberty either absurd or criminal. All systems, on whatever\r\nprinciples they may found the laws of morality and\r\nreason,--whether they speak of interest, feeling, general\r\nconsent, or duty,--whether they are spiritualistic or\r\nmaterialistic in their origin,--whether they emanate from\r\nsceptics or from dogmatists,--all admit that some acts are\r\nreasonable and others unreasonable, some just and others unjust,\r\nand that if the individual does in fact remain free to act either\r\nto or in violation of reason, this liberty does not constitute\r\nany right, or cause any act which is in itself absurd or criminal\r\nto cease to be so because it has been performed voluntarily.\r\n\r\nMore than this: as soon as an individual prepared to act demands\r\nfrom his understanding some enlightenment for his liberty, he\r\nperceives the law which enjoins upon him that which is in itself\r\ntrue, and at the same time he recognizes that this law is not the\r\nproduct of his own individual nature, and that, by the volitions\r\nof his will, he can neither disown nor change it.\r\n{343}\r\nHis will remains free to obey or to disobey his reason: but his\r\nreason, in its turn, remains independent of his will, and\r\nnecessarily judges, according to the law which it has\r\nrecognized, the will which revolts against it.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Of Will-Representation.\r\n\r\nThus, speaking philosophically and rightfully, the individual\r\nconsidered in himself, may not dispose of himself arbitrarily and\r\naccording to his solitary will. Laws which are obligatory are not\r\ncreated or imposed upon him by his will. He receives them from a\r\nhigher source; they come to him from a sphere that is above the\r\nregion of his liberty,--from a sphere where liberty is\r\nnot,--where the question to be considered is not whether a thing\r\nis willed or not willed, but whether it is true or false, just or\r\nunjust, conformable or contrary to reason. When these laws\r\ndescend from this sublime sphere in order to enter into that of\r\nthe material world, they are constrained to pass through the\r\nregion where liberty, which exists on the confines of these two\r\nworlds, has its sway; and here it is that the question arises\r\nwhether the free will of the individual will or will not conform\r\nto the laws of this sovereign reason. But in whatever way this\r\nquestion is decided, sovereignty does not forsake reason and\r\nattach itself to will. In no possible case can will of itself\r\nconfer upon the acts which it produces the character of\r\nlegitimacy; they have, or they have not this characteristic,\r\naccording as they are or are not conformed to reason, justice,\r\nand truth, from which alone legitimate power can spring.\r\n\r\nTo express the same thought in a different way,--man has not an\r\nabsolute power over himself in virtue of his will: as a moral and\r\nreasonable being he is a subject,--subject to laws which he did\r\nnot himself make, but which have a rightful authority over him,\r\nalthough, as a free agent, he has the power to refuse them, not\r\nhis consent but his obedience.\r\n\r\nIf we look at all philosophical systems in their basis,--if we\r\nrise above the differences that may exist in their forms,--we\r\nshall be convinced that no one is to be found which has not\r\nadmitted the principle which I have now expressed. How then does\r\nit arise that philosophers, when they leave man regarded as an\r\nisolated being, and look at him in his relations with other men,\r\nhave started from a principle which they would not have dared to\r\nadopt as the foundation of their moral doctrines, but which has\r\nserved as a basis to their political theories?\r\n{344}\r\nHow comes it that the will which, in the solitary individual, has\r\nnever been raised to the position of an absolute and solely\r\nlegitimate sovereign, does yet suddenly find itself invested with\r\nthis title and its corresponding rights, as soon as the\r\nindividual is brought into the presence of other individuals of\r\nlike nature with himself?\r\n\r\n\r\n         Province Of The Will.\r\n\r\nThe fact may be thus represented: In that commingling and\r\ncollision of individuals which we call society, the philosophers\r\nof whom we speak have pertinaciously adhered to that which does\r\nin fact first present itself, namely, the commingling and\r\ncollision of individual wills. A true instinct, unrecognized\r\nperhaps by them, has suddenly reminded them that the will is not,\r\nin itself, and by its essential constitution, the legitimate\r\nsovereign of man. If it does not occupy this position in the\r\nindividual and so far as he is himself concerned, how should it\r\nbe elevated to such a rank when another individual is concerned?\r\nHow should that which, in its own acts, has nothing that is\r\nlegitimate in the view of reason, when it says _I\r\nwill_,--how should it have any right to impose its will as the\r\nlaw for another person? No will, merely because it is a will, has\r\nany authority over another will:--this is evident; any opposite\r\nassumption is revolting; it is brute force, sheer despotism.\r\n\r\nHow shall these perplexities be removed? How shall individual\r\nwills be made to co-operate without conflicting, to shelter\r\nwithout overpowering one another? Philosophers have only seen one\r\nmethod of accomplishing this, and that is to attribute to each\r\nwill an absolute sovereignty, an entire independence; they have\r\ndeclared that every individual is the absolute master of his own\r\nperson; that is to say, they have elevated all individual wills\r\nto the rank and position of sovereignty. Accordingly the will\r\nwhich, in man considered apart and by himself, possesses no\r\nsovereign and legitimate power, has been invested with it as soon\r\nas man is viewed in his relations with other men. Thus the reply,\r\n_my will does not consent_, which, within the individual\r\nhimself, cannot establish any right if it be contrary to the laws\r\nof the reason, has become, outside of the individual, the\r\nfoundation of right, the ever-sufficient and finally\r\nauthoritative reason.\r\n\r\n{345}\r\n\r\n         Argument From Parental Authority.\r\n\r\nIs it necessary that we should prove that a principle, which, in\r\nits application to man considered as an individual, is evidently\r\nfalse and destructive of all morality and of all law, is equally\r\nso in the relations between man and man; and that in the one case\r\nas in the other, the legitimacy of law and of power, that is to\r\nsay, of obedience or of resistance, is derived from quite another\r\nsource than the will?--Two facts shall serve us in the stead of\r\narguments:--\r\n\r\nWho has ever denied the legitimacy of parental authority? it has\r\nits limits, and may be carried to excess like every other human\r\npower; but has it ever been alleged that it is illegitimate so\r\noften as the obedience of the child, whom it seeks to control, is\r\nnot voluntary? An instinctive sense of the truth has in this case\r\nprevented any one from even maintaining such an absurdity.\r\nNevertheless the will of the child, considered in itself, does\r\nnot at all differ from that of the fully-grown man; it is of the\r\nsame nature, and it is equally precious to the individual. Here\r\nthen is an illustration of legitimate power in cases in which\r\nobedience to it is not voluntary. And from whence does this power\r\nborrow its legitimacy? evidently from the superiority of the\r\nfather's reason to that of the child, a superiority which\r\nindicates the position which the father is called to occupy by a\r\nlaw above him, and which establishes his right to assume that\r\nposition. The rightful sway here does not belong to the will of\r\nthe child, who wants the reason that is necessary for such sway,\r\nnor even does it belong to the mere will of the father, for will\r\ncan never vindicate right from itself; it belongs to reason, and\r\nto him who possesses it. The mission which is given by God to the\r\nfather to fulfil, is that he should teach his child what reason\r\nteaches him, and should bend his will to the claims of reason,\r\nuntil he shall be able to control his will for himself. The\r\nlegitimacy of parental power is derived from the fact of this\r\nmission: this establishes its right and also determines its\r\nlimits, for the father has no right to impose upon the child any\r\nlaws except such as are just and reasonable. Hence the rules and\r\nprocesses of a judicious education, that is to say, of the\r\nlegitimate exercise of parental power; but the principle of right\r\nis in the mission and the reason of the parent, and not in either\r\nof the wills which are here brought into relation one to the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n{346}\r\n\r\n         Reason The Source Of Power.\r\n\r\nLet me remind you of another fact. When any man is well known to\r\nbe mad or idiotic, it is customary to deprive him of his full\r\nliberty. On what grounds? has his will perished? if it is the\r\nprinciple of legitimate power, is it not always there to exercise\r\nit? The will is still there; but the true sovereign of the man,\r\nthe lord of the will itself, reasoning intelligence, has departed\r\nfrom the individual. It must therefore be supplied to him from\r\nanother source,--a reason external to himself must govern him,\r\nsince his own has become incapable of controlling his will.\r\n\r\nWhat is true concerning the child and the imbecile is true of man\r\nin general: the right to power is always derived from reason,\r\nnever from will. No one has a right to impose a law because he\r\nwills it; no one has a right to refuse submission to it because\r\nhis will is opposed to it;--the legitimacy of power rests in the\r\nconformity of its laws to the eternal reason--not in the will of\r\nthe man who exercises, nor of him who submits to power.\r\n\r\nIf therefore philosophers desired to give a principle of\r\nlegitimacy to power, and to restrain it within the limits of\r\nright, instead of raising all individual wills to the position of\r\nsovereigns and of rivals in sovereignty, they should have brought\r\nthem all into the condition of subjects, and appointed over them\r\none sovereign. Instead of saying that every man is his own\r\nabsolute master, and that no other man has a right over him\r\nagainst his will, they should proclaim that no man is the\r\nabsolute master either of himself or of any other person, and\r\nthat no action, no power exercised by man over man, is legitimate\r\nif it wants the sanction of reason, justice, and truth, which are\r\nthe law of God. In one word, they should everywhere proscribe\r\nabsolute power, instead of affording it an asylum in each\r\nindividual will, and allow to every man the right, which he does\r\nin fact possess, of refusing obedience to any law that is not a\r\ndivine law, instead of attributing to him the right, which he\r\ndoes not actually possess, of obeying nothing but his own will.\r\n\r\n{347}\r\n\r\n           True Doctrine Of Representation.\r\n\r\nI may now return to the particular question which I proposed in\r\nstarting, and determine what _representation_ truly is, thus\r\njustifying in its principle as in its results, the system of\r\ngovernment to which this name is applied.\r\n\r\nWe are no longer concerned to represent individual wills, which\r\nis really an impossibility, as Rousseau has fully demonstrated,\r\nthough he was mistaken in thinking that this is the aim of\r\nrepresentation. We are not, therefore, careful to evade this\r\nimpossibility, and so fall into inconsistency, as has been done\r\nby other political theorists. These attempts, illegitimate in\r\nprinciple and vain in their issues, are, besides, chargeable with\r\nthe immense mischief of deceiving men; for they profess to\r\nestablish themselves on a principle which they constantly\r\nviolate; and by a culpable falsehood, they promise to every\r\nindividual a respect for his individual will,--whether\r\nenlightened or ignorant, reasonable or unreasonable, just or\r\nunjust--such as, in fact, they cannot give to it, and which they\r\nare of necessity obliged to deny.\r\n\r\nThe true doctrine of representation is more philosophical and\r\nmore sincere. Starting from the principle that truth, reason, and\r\njustice,--in one word, the divine law,--alone possess rightful\r\npower, its reasoning is somewhat as follows:--Every society,\r\naccording to its interior organization, its antecedents, and the\r\naggregate of influences which have or do still modify it, is\r\nplaced to a certain extent in a position to apprehend truth and\r\njustice as the divine law, and is in a measure disposed to\r\nconform itself to this law. Employing less general terms:--there\r\nexists in every society a certain number of just ideas and wills\r\nin harmony with those ideas, which respect the reciprocal rights\r\nof men and social relations with their results. This sum of just\r\nideas and loyal wills is dispersed among the individuals who\r\ncompose society, and unequally diffused among them on account of\r\nthe infinitely varied causes which influence the moral and\r\nintellectual development of men. The grand concern, therefore, of\r\nsociety is--that, so far as either abiding infirmity or the\r\nexisting condition of human affairs will allow, this power of\r\nreason, justice, and truth, which alone has an inherent\r\nlegitimacy, and alone has the right to demand obedience, may\r\nbecome prevalent in the community. The problem evidently is to\r\ncollect from all sides the scattered and incomplete fragments of\r\nthis power that exist in society, to concentrate them, and from\r\nthem, to constitute a government.\r\n{348}\r\nIn other words, it is required to discover all the elements of\r\nlegitimate power that are disseminated throughout society, and to\r\norganize them into an actual power; that is to say, to collect\r\ninto one focus, and to realize, public reason and public\r\nmorality, and to call them to the occupation of power.\r\n\r\n\r\n         What Is Representation?\r\n\r\nWhat we call _representation_ is nothing else than a means\r\nto arrive at this result:--it is not an arithmetical machine\r\nemployed to collect and count individual wills, but a natural\r\nprocess by which public reason, which alone has a right to govern\r\nsociety, may be extracted from the bosom of society itself. No\r\nreason has in fact a right to say beforehand for itself that it\r\nis the reason of the community. If it claims to be such, it must\r\nprove that it is so, that is to say, it must accredit itself to\r\nother individual reasons which are capable of judging it. If we\r\nlook at facts, we shall find that all institutions, all\r\nconditions of the representative system, flow from and return to\r\nthis point. Election, publicity, and responsibility, are so many\r\ntests applied to individual reasons, which in the search for, or\r\nthe exercise of, power, assume to be interpreters of the reason\r\nof the community; so many means of bringing to light the elements\r\nof legitimate power, and preventing usurpation.\r\n\r\nIn this system, it is true,--and the fact arises from the\r\nnecessity of liberty as actual in the world--that truth and\r\nerror, perverse and loyal wills, in one word, the good and evil\r\nwhich co-exist and contend in society as in the individual, will\r\nmost probably express themselves; this is the condition of the\r\nworld; it is the necessary result of liberty. But against the\r\nevil of this there are two guarantees: one is found in the\r\npublicity of the struggle, which always gives the right the best\r\nchance of success, for it has been recognized in all ages of the\r\nworld that good is in friendship with the light, while evil ever\r\nshelters itself in darkness; this idea, which is common to all\r\nthe religions of the world, symbolizes and indicates the first of\r\nall truths. The second guarantee consists in the determination of\r\na certain amount of capacity to be possessed by those who aspire\r\nto exercise any branch of power. In the system of representing\r\nwills, nothing could justify such a limitation, for the will\r\nexists full and entire in all men, and confers on all an equal\r\nright; but the limitation flows necessarily from the principle\r\nwhich attributes power to reason, and not to will.\r\n\r\n{349}\r\n\r\n              Summary.\r\n\r\nSo then,--to review the course we have taken,--the power of man\r\nover himself is neither arbitrary nor absolute; as a reasonable\r\nbeing, he is bound to obey reason. The same principle subsists in\r\nthe relations between man and man: in this case also, power is\r\nonly legitimate in so far as it is conformed to reason.\r\n\r\nLiberty, as existing in the individual man, is the power to\r\nconform his will to reason. On this account it is sacred;\r\naccordingly the right to liberty, in the relations of man with\r\nman, is derived from the right to obey nothing that is not\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nThe guarantees due to liberty in the social state have,\r\ntherefore, for their aim, to procure indirectly the legitimacy of\r\nactual power, that is to say, the conformity of its wills to that\r\nreason which ought to govern all wills, those which command as\r\nwell as those which obey.\r\n\r\nTherefore no actual power ought to be absolute, and liberty is\r\nguaranteed only in so far as power is bound to prove its\r\nlegitimacy.\r\n\r\nPower proves its legitimacy, that is to say, its conformity to\r\nthe eternal reason, by making itself recognized and accepted by\r\nthe free reason of the men over whom it is exercised. This is the\r\nobject of the representative system.\r\n\r\nSo far then from representation founding itself on a right,\r\ninherent in all individual wills, to concur in the exercise of\r\npower, it on the other hand rests on the principle that no will\r\nhas in itself any right to power, and that whoever exercises, or\r\nclaims to exercise power, is bound to prove that he exercises, or\r\nwill exercise it, not according to his own will, but according to\r\nreason. If we examine the representative system in all its\r\nforms,--for it admits of different forms according to the state\r\nof society to which it is applied,--we shall see that such are\r\neverywhere the necessary results and the true foundations of that\r\nwhich we call representation.\r\n\r\n{350}\r\n\r\n              Lecture XI.\r\n\r\n  Formation of a Parliament.\r\n\r\n  Introduction of county deputies into the Parliament.\r\n\r\n  Relations of the county deputies to the great barons.\r\n\r\n  Parliament of Oxford (1258).\r\n\r\n  Its regulations, termed the Acts of Oxford.\r\n\r\n  Hesitancy of the county deputies between the great barons and\r\n  the crown.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Formation Of A Parliament.\r\n\r\nBefore we commenced the history of the charters, and after we had\r\nfor some time fixed our attention on the Anglo-Norman government,\r\nwe saw that this government was composed of but two great forces,\r\nroyalty and the council of barons, a unique and central assembly,\r\nwhich alone shared with the king the exercise of power. Such was\r\nthe state in which we found the government of England under\r\nWilliam the Conqueror and his sons. But from their reigns to that\r\nof Edward I., a great change was being gradually evolved; after a\r\nlaborious struggle, the charters were finally conceded, and the\r\nrights which they proclaim were definitively recognised. If,\r\nafter this complete revolution, we cast a glance over the\r\ninstitutions of the country, we find them all changed; we\r\nperceive that the government has taken another form, that new\r\nelements have been introduced into it, that the\r\nParliament,--composed in one of its divisions of the lords\r\nspiritual and temporal, in the other of deputies from the\r\ncounties and boroughs,--has taken the place of the great council\r\nof barons.\r\n\r\nThis transformation is a fact; how was it produced? what were its\r\ncauses and its mode of advance? what was the new Parliament after\r\nits formation? how far and in what respects did the introduction\r\nof these deputies change the character of the government? These\r\nare the questions that we have now to consider; and in order to\r\nanswer them we must analyze and examine the principal individual\r\nfacts which here combine to produce the common result.\r\n\r\n{351}\r\n\r\n            Of County Deputies.\r\n\r\nThe first of these facts is the introduction of county deputies\r\ninto the national assembly. I shall first enquire how this event\r\nwas brought about; and I shall then propose similar enquiries\r\nwith respect to the introduction of town and borough\r\nrepresentatives into the same assembly.\r\n\r\nTwo causes effected the introduction of county deputies into\r\nParliament: first, the privileges belonging to knights as\r\nimmediate vassals of the king; secondly, their interference in\r\ncounty affairs by means of the county-courts.\r\n\r\nThe immediate vassals of the king had in that capacity two\r\nfundamental rights; that no extraordinary charge should be\r\nimposed without their consent, and that they should have a place\r\nin the king's court, either to give judgments, or to treat of\r\npublic affairs. They were from both these circumstances, members\r\nof the general assembly by inheritance. They formed the political\r\nnation. They took a part in the government, and in the\r\ndetermination of public charges, as a personal right.\r\n\r\nAlthough they were not elected and had received neither\r\nappointment nor mandate, we may nevertheless say that they were\r\nregarded as representing their own vassals, and that it was only\r\nin virtue of the power which was attributed to them in this\r\nfictitious representation that they exercised the right of\r\nlevying imposts on all the proprietors in the kingdom. [Footnote\r\n26]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 26: This is expressly indicated by two writs, one\r\n    in the reign of John, dated Feb. 17, 1208; the other issued\r\n    by Henry III., July 12, 1237.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps they never could have fully organized themselves into a\r\nunited body, and soon this became impossible. On the one hand,\r\nthere rose up among the direct vassals of the king, some\r\ninfluential barons, who united a considerable number of knights'\r\nfiefs into one, and became by this cause much more powerful; and\r\non the other hand, the number of knights with smaller wealth\r\nbecame much more considerable by the division of fiefs, which was\r\nitself the result of a vast variety of causes. However, the right\r\nof appearing at the general assembly and of giving their personal\r\nsanction to all extraordinary imposts, always remained to them.\r\nThis is formally recognized in Magna Charta, Article 14.\r\n\r\n{352}\r\n\r\n         The Knights Of Shires.\r\n\r\nThis same article proves at the same time that there existed an\r\nevident inequality between different immediate vassals, for it\r\nordains that the great barons should be summoned individually,\r\nwhile the others should be convoked _en masse_ by means of\r\nthe sheriffs. This is not the first time that such a difference\r\nin the mode of convocation is to be observed; it had already\r\nexisted for some time, and was exemplified whenever the king\r\nrequired from his vassals the military service which they were\r\nbound to give him.\r\n\r\nThus, at the commencement of the thirteenth century, the right to\r\ntake a seat in the national assembly belonged to all the\r\nimmediate vassals of the king, but it was scarcely ever exercised\r\non account of obstacles which increased every day. The assembly\r\nwas almost entirely composed of the great barons.\r\n\r\nBut the other vassals, on the other hand, did not renounce their\r\npolitical existence; if their influence daily became more and\r\nmore limited to their own county, there at least they exercised\r\ntheir rights and interfered actively in affairs. We often find\r\nthat knights were nominated, sometimes by the sheriff, sometimes\r\nby the court itself, to give their decision on matters connected\r\nwith the county. Thus William the Conqueror charged two free men\r\nin each county with the business of collecting and publishing the\r\nancient laws and local customs. The Great Charter provides that\r\ntwelve knights shall be elected in each county to enquire into\r\nabuses. These examples are frequent in the reigns of Henry III.\r\nand Edward I. Two writs of Henry III. [Footnote 27] prove that\r\nsubsidies were at that time assessed, not, as previously, by the\r\njudges in their circuits, but by knights elected in the\r\ncounty-court. The knights in this way brought their influence to\r\nbear upon government by the offices they discharged in their\r\nprovinces, while at the same time they preserved, though without\r\nexercising it, the right to appear at the general assemblies.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 27: One in 1220, the other in 1225.]\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, in proportion as they thus became\r\nseparated from the great barons, the knights who were direct\r\nvassals of the king united themselves more closely to another\r\nclass of men, with whose interests they after a time completely\r\nidentified themselves. They did not alone occupy a position in\r\nthe county courts; many freeholders, subordinate vassals of the\r\nking, also constantly presented themselves at these courts, and\r\nperformed the same administrative or judicial functions.\r\n{353}\r\nService in the county court was an obligation imposed in common,\r\nby their tenure, on all freeholders, whether vassals of the king\r\nor of any other feudal lord. Many of the latter were more wealthy\r\nand influential than certain direct vassals of the king. The\r\npractice of subenfiefment augmented their number continually.\r\nMany who were simply _socagers_ gradually became\r\nconsiderable freeholders by receiving free lands from different\r\nnobles. Thus, a body of freeholders was formed in every county,\r\nthe county court being its centre. There they all discharged the\r\nsame functions, and exercised the same rights; whatever, in other\r\nrespects, might be their feudal relations with the crown. We thus\r\nsee that the dissolution, on the one hand, of the ancient general\r\nassembly of immediate vassals of the king, and the localisation,\r\non the other hand, of a great number of them in the county\r\ncourts, while at the same time their interests were united with\r\nthose of the freeholders, prepared the elements of a new nation,\r\nand consequently of a new political order.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Representation Of Knights.\r\n\r\nLet us now see how this new nation manifested its existence, and\r\nwas brought to a central position in the State by means of\r\nrepresentation.\r\n\r\nIn 1214, while the discontented barons were preparing for\r\nrevolution, John convoked a general assembly at Oxford. The writs\r\nof the king ordered the sheriffs to demand for that assembly the\r\nassistance of a certain number of armed knights; while other\r\nwrits [Footnote 28] ordered that the followers of the barons\r\nshould present themselves at Oxford _without arms_, and\r\nenjoined besides that the sheriffs should send to Oxford four\r\napproved knights from each county \"in order to consider, with us,\r\nthe affairs of our kingdom.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 28: Dated November 15, 1214.]\r\n\r\nThis is the first indication of knights being represented in\r\nParliament, that is to say, of the admission of certain\r\nindividuals, who should appear and act in the name of all.\r\n\r\nWas then this idea at that time present to their minds? Probably\r\nnot. How were these four knights nominated? Were they chosen by\r\nthe sheriff, or elected by the county court? Were these writs\r\nactually executed? All this is uncertain. But that which admits\r\nof no doubt is the aim and tendency of this innovation.\r\n{354}\r\nThe contents of the writs themselves, and the circumstances in\r\nthe midst of which they were issued, clearly indicate its object.\r\nIt is evident that John wished to find in the knights of the\r\nshires a means of defence against the barons, and that\r\nconsequently the former already formed a class so far distinct\r\nfrom the latter that the attempt to separate them entirely from\r\nit was not altogether unreasonable, while they were sufficiently\r\nimportant to be appealed to as powerful auxiliaries.\r\n\r\nJohn's attempt did not succeed. Facts prove that, in the struggle\r\nbetween the royal power and the barons, the knights and other\r\nfreeholders espoused the cause of the latter, who, as they\r\nprotested in favour of public rights, were acting no less for the\r\ninterest of the knights than for their own.\r\n\r\nThe struggle continued during the whole of Henry the Third's\r\nreign, and throughout this period we find the king constantly\r\nendeavouring to alienate the knights from the party of the barons\r\nand win them over to his own, while the barons exerted themselves\r\nto keep the knights attached to themselves.\r\n\r\nThe following is an illustration of the attempts made by the\r\nroyal power. In 1225, one of the periods when the charters were\r\nconfirmed by Henry III., we find that writs were addressed to the\r\nsheriffs of eight counties, requiring them to cause to be elected\r\nin each of these counties four knights who should present\r\nthemselves at Lincoln, where the council of barons was then\r\nassembled, in order to set forth the grievances of their counties\r\nagainst the said sheriffs, who also should be present to explain\r\nor defend themselves. In this case, there is no reference except\r\nto merely local affairs of particular counties, and the four\r\nknights are not called upon to take any part in the general\r\nassembly, but they are elected and sent in order to treat of the\r\naffairs of their counties before the central council. Here the\r\nelection is a positive fact in the case, and the nature of their\r\ncommission--to protest against local grievances,--is one of the\r\nprinciples of representation.\r\n\r\nIn 1240, we find a general assembly of barons meeting in London,\r\nin which, however, there is nothing remarkable except the name\r\ngiven to it by the chroniclers. In speaking of it, Matthew Paris\r\nemploys for the first time, the word _Parliament_\r\n(_parliamentum_).\r\n\r\n{355}\r\n\r\nLastly, in 1254, when Henry III. was in Gascony and wanted money,\r\nhe ordered the convocation of an extraordinary Parliament in\r\nLondon in order to demand of it an extraordinary subsidy. At the\r\nsame time, he addressed a writ to the sheriffs, enjoining them to\r\ncause two knights to be elected in the county courts, \"in the\r\nstead of each and all of them,\" (_vice omnium et singulorum\r\neorumdem_,) to deliberate on the aid to be granted to the\r\nking. Here then is a real and positive instance of\r\nrepresentation; deputies are elected, they are introduced into\r\nthe assembly, and a deliberative voice is there given to them.\r\nCertain historians have maintained that these writs were not\r\nexecuted,--but on this point no satisfactory information is to be\r\nhad. However, as it is proved that a subsidy was granted to the\r\nking, there is reason to believe that it was consented to by this\r\nassembly, composed of barons and knights.\r\n\r\nUp to this time, the great feudal aristocracy had retained the\r\nknights and other freeholders on their side; we have now to see\r\nhow they became alienated from them, and how, after having been\r\nfor a long time the allies of the barons, they became afterwards\r\nallies of the throne.\r\n\r\n\r\n         De Montfort's Rebellion.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1254, a general irritation broke out in the\r\nkingdom on the occasion of the demand for an extraordinary\r\nsubsidy. Henry III., who was misled by the artifices and promises\r\nof Pope Innocent IV., had engaged in an adventurous war against\r\nManfred, the usurper of the throne of Naples;--a war in which\r\nHenry must have borne all the expense, and of which the Pope\r\nwould doubtless have reaped all the advantages, if it had\r\nsucceeded. But there was no occasion that his good faith should\r\nbe put to such a test, for the war was an entire failure. Henry,\r\nhowever, had contracted an enormous debt; his prodigality and\r\nextravagance had drained his resources; and he was obliged to\r\nappeal to his subjects in order to relieve himself of this\r\nburden. These demands for money, which indicate what progress the\r\nprinciple that the king cannot levy imposts on his sole\r\nresponsibility had made, served as a pretext for the discontented\r\nbarons to take arms against their king. Simon de Montfort, Earl\r\nof Leicester, placed himself at their head, and civil war was\r\ndeclared.\r\n\r\n{356}\r\n\r\nBut the aristocracy were weary of these incessant combats, which\r\nonly yielded momentary advantages. The insurgents formed the\r\nproject of no longer contenting themselves with conquering the\r\nking,--they determined so far to fetter him as that henceforth he\r\nshould be fully dependent upon them. The barons who had wrested\r\nMagna Charta from King John had attempted, in order to provide\r\nthemselves with guarantees, to give beforehand a legal\r\norganization to civil war, in case the charter should be\r\nviolated. The barons who dictated the law to Henry III., went\r\nfarther: they attempted to organize, not a resistance but a\r\npower, and to secure for themselves guarantees, not in civil war\r\nbut in the very constitution of the government. Not being able to\r\nrestrain the authority of the king within just limits, they\r\nundertook to deprive him of it altogether, and to assume it\r\nthemselves,--in one word, to substitute the government of an\r\naristocracy for that of the king.\r\n\r\n\r\n         The First Parliament.\r\n\r\nThey had already made a similar attempt in 1244, when their\r\ndesign had been that four prominent members of their body should\r\nbe admitted to the council of the king, who would have followed\r\nhim constantly and governed under his name. At that time the\r\nattempt had been unsuccessful, but at the time which we are now\r\nconsidering, their endeavours were followed by better results. In\r\nthe Parliaments convoked successively in 1255, 1257, and 1258,\r\nthe most violent reproaches were heaped upon Henry III. as to his\r\nprodigality, his faults, his infatuated enterprises, and above\r\nall the violation of his oaths of fidelity to the Great Charter.\r\nHenry was intimidated, and, as he desired to appease his barons\r\nin order to obtain from them a subsidy, he promised to repair his\r\nerrors and reform his government. It was determined that this\r\nreform should be regulated by a Parliament convoked at Oxford,\r\nJune 11, 1258.\r\n\r\nThis is the first assembly that has received the official\r\ndesignation of Parliament. The barons attended it, armed and\r\nfollowed by a large retinue; Henry, on the contrary, not having\r\ntaken any precautions against them, found himself their prisoner.\r\nNevertheless they performed what had been agreed upon, that is to\r\nsay, that they should commit the care of deciding on the\r\nprojected reforms to twenty-four barons, of whom twelve were\r\nchosen by them, and twelve nominated by the king.\r\n\r\n{357}\r\n\r\nAn unlimited authority was conferred upon these twenty-four\r\nmediators. They began by making a complete change in the form of\r\ngovernment. Their first concern was to form the king's council,\r\nand four barons chosen by the confederation were commissioned to\r\norganize it. They composed it of fifteen members, and of these\r\nfifteen, nine at least were taken from the party of the barons,\r\nso that the chief power was placed entirely in the hands of these\r\nnine persons, and consequently, in the hands of the barons.\r\n\r\n\r\n         The Acts Of Oxford.\r\n\r\nA large number of regulations, known under the name of the\r\n_Acts of Oxford_, were determined upon by this assembly,\r\nthat is to say, by the council of twenty-four barons. No complete\r\ncollection of them is to be found in any authentic document. The\r\nfollowing maybe gathered from different historians; among other\r\nthings the barons demanded:--\r\n\r\n  1. That the charters should be confirmed;\r\n\r\n  2. That they themselves should annually nominate the judges,\r\n  the chancellor, the treasurer, and other officers of the king;\r\n\r\n  3. That they should have the keeping of the royal castles;\r\n\r\n  4. That three Parliaments should be convoked every year, in the\r\n  months of February, June, and October;\r\n\r\n  5. That a permanent commission of twelve barons should be\r\n  appointed, who should be present at these Parliaments, and\r\n  assist the royal council in the transaction of all business;\r\n\r\n  6. That four knights should be appointed in each county, to\r\n  receive all complaints against the sheriffs or other officers\r\n  of the king, and to give an account of these to the next\r\n  Parliament;\r\n\r\n  7. That, for the future, the sheriffs should be nominated by\r\n  the county courts;\r\n\r\n  8. Lastly, that the king, his son Edward, his brothers, the\r\n  archbishops, bishops, &c., should be obliged on oath to promise\r\n  fidelity to the Acts of Oxford.\r\n\r\nIt was further agreed that the committee of twenty-four barons\r\nshould reform all the abuses that had been committed in the\r\nkingdom, and administer, in the name of the king, the laws that\r\nwere necessary for this purpose; and then allow the government\r\nthus regulated to proceed in an orderly way.\r\n\r\n{358}\r\n\r\n         Tyranny Of The Barons.\r\n\r\nBut after the separation of the Parliament, the barons, under the\r\npretext that they had yet abuses to reform and laws to\r\nadminister, refused to resign their power; and not content with\r\nretaining it illegally, they employed it to their own advantage.\r\nTheir acts and laws had no other object than their own personal\r\ninterest. Without knowing it, they were acting ruinously to\r\nthemselves, for they detached from their party that part of the\r\npopulation which clearly apprehended their designs. Two laws\r\nespecially alienated the minds of the people from them; one of\r\nthese laws took away from the sheriffs the right to fine those\r\nbarons who should refuse to present themselves at the county\r\ncourts, or at the assizes held by the judges in circuit. The\r\nsecond decided that the judges' circuits should only take place\r\nevery seven years.\r\n\r\nThese measures opened the eyes of the people, and they speedily\r\nabandoned the authors of them. One fact may prove how far their\r\ntyranny had been already exercised at the expense of the country.\r\nA deputation was sent to Prince Edward in the name of the English\r\nbachelors (_communitatis bachelariæ Angliæ_), praying him to\r\ncompel the barons to finish their work and fulfil their promises,\r\nas the king had fulfilled his. The prince replied that he had\r\nsworn fidelity to the Acts of Oxford, and that he was resolved to\r\nkeep his oath. Nevertheless, he demanded of the barons, that they\r\nshould resign their power, threatening if they refused, to compel\r\nthem to do so, and to take into his hands the interests of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nWhat was this _communitatis bachelariæ Angliæ_? There is\r\nreason to believe that by this name, the body of knights of\r\nshires represented themselves. We see by this that the great\r\nbarons had alienated from themselves this class of men, and that\r\nthe king had begun to attach them to his party.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts we see that besides the two great powers\r\nanciently established,--the nobility arid royalty,--a third power\r\nhad been formed at this period, which alternately inclined to one\r\nor other of these rival powers, and which already exercised a\r\nstrong influence, since it ensured victory to the party in whose\r\nfavour it might pronounce.\r\n\r\n{359}\r\n\r\n              Lecture XII.\r\n\r\n  Struggle between Henry III. and his Parliament.\r\n\r\n  Arbitration of Saint Louis.\r\n\r\n  The Earl of Leicester heads the great barons in their struggle\r\n  with the king.\r\n\r\n  He is defeated and killed at Evesham (1265).\r\n\r\n  Admission of deputies from towns and boroughs into Parliament\r\n  (1264).\r\n\r\n  Royalist reaction.\r\n\r\n  Leicester's memory remains popular.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Henry III. And His Parliament.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how, in the midst of the struggles between royalty\r\nand the feudal aristocracy, an intermediate class arose,--a new\r\nbut already imposing power,--and how the two contending powers\r\neach felt the necessity of securing an alliance with this third\r\npower; we have now to follow, by the examination of authentic\r\ndocuments, that is to say, of the writs and laws of the period,\r\nthe progress of this new class, which we shall find taking an\r\nincreasingly active part in the government of the country.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how the twenty-four barons, who were commissioned to\r\nreform the constitution of the kingdom, abusing the power which\r\nthey thus held in trust, had refused, in spite of the king and\r\nthe country, to resign their dictatorship. This refusal soon\r\nexcited violent dissensions between them and the king, and civil\r\nwar was on the point of being again enkindled. In 1261, Henry\r\nsent writs to several sheriffs, enjoining them to send to him, at\r\nWindsor, the three knights of each shire who had been summoned to\r\nSt. Albans by the Earl of Leicester and his party. These writs\r\nplainly show that the king and the barons endeavoured more than\r\never to conciliate the body of knights, and that the king had\r\nthen succeeded in attaching them to his party.\r\n\r\n{360}\r\n\r\n         Arbitration Of St. Louis.\r\n\r\nHenry sought yet another assistance. On his entreaty, the Pope\r\nreleased him from his oath of fidelity to the Acts of Oxford.\r\nDelivered from his scruples, Henry now openly broke off his\r\nagreements with the barons, and again possessed himself of the\r\nreins of government. In 1262, he convoked a Parliament at\r\nWestminster, that his authority might be sustained by its\r\nsanction. He met with but little opposition: wishing, however, to\r\ndeprive the barons of every motive for revolt, he agreed to leave\r\nthe adjustment of their claims to the judgment of an arbitrator.\r\nThe great renown for wisdom and equity which Saint Louis\r\npossessed pointed him out as the best judge in this important\r\ndispute. Accordingly Henry and his barons agreed to abide by his\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nSaint Louis assembled his great council at Amiens, and after\r\ncareful deliberations, he recorded a judgment by which the Acts\r\nof Oxford were to be annulled, and the king to be placed again in\r\npossession of his castles, as well as of the right to nominate\r\nhis own counsellors. But as he was equally careful to preserve\r\nthe lawful prerogatives of the English people and those of the\r\ncrown, Saint Louis gave his formal approval to all the ancient\r\nprivileges, charters, and liberties of England, and proclaimed an\r\nabsolute and reciprocal amnesty for both parties.\r\n\r\nScarcely had this decision been made known than Leicester and his\r\nparty refused to submit to it, and took up arms for the purpose\r\nof seizing by force that which had been refused to them by\r\njustice. Civil war was recommenced with much animosity, but it\r\nwas not of long duration. Leicester surprised the royalist army\r\nat Lewes, in the county of Sussex, on the 14th of May, 1264.\r\nHenry and his son Edward, being vanquished and taken prisoners,\r\nwere constrained to receive the terms offered them by the\r\nconqueror. The conditions which he imposed were severe, but he\r\ndid not assume to himself the right of settling the reforms that\r\nwere to be made in the government; he only retained as hostages\r\nthe brother and son of the king, and left to Parliament the care\r\nof settling political questions. Ideas respecting the legal\r\nauthority of Parliaments, and the illegitimacy of force in\r\nmatters relating to government, must have made considerable\r\nprogress, when we find that the victorious Earl of Leicester did\r\nnot venture to regulate on his own sole responsibility the plan\r\nof administration for the kingdom.\r\n\r\n{361}\r\n\r\n         Government Of Leicester.\r\n\r\nHe did not, however, scruple to exercise other rights which did\r\nnot belong to him any more than these. Under the king's name,\r\nwho, though to all appearance set at liberty, did in fact remain\r\nhis prisoner, Leicester governed the kingdom. In each county he\r\ncreated extraordinary magistrates, called preservers of the\r\npeace. Their duties were almost identical with those of the\r\nsheriffs, but their power was of much wider range. Leicester\r\nenjoined them to cause four knights to be elected in each county,\r\nand to send them to the Parliament which was to meet at London in\r\nJune 1264.\r\n\r\nThis Parliament assembled and passed a decree which was designed\r\nto organize the government. This decree constrained the king to\r\nfollow in everything the advice of a council composed of nine\r\nmembers, nominated by three principal electors, the Earls of\r\nLeicester and Gloucester, and the Bishop of Winchester.\r\n\r\nLeicester still remained the real head of the State. In the midst\r\nof his power he was troubled by alarming disturbances; powerful\r\npreparations to oppose him were being made in France. These\r\nattempts were unsuccessful, and Leicester, in order to anticipate\r\nany fresh opposition, undisguisedly sought protection from that\r\npart of the population, which was every day becoming more\r\nnumerous and powerful,--the middle classes. On the 14th of\r\nDecember 1264, he summoned a Parliament, and gave to it all the\r\nextent which it has since preserved, that is to say, he called to\r\nit the peers, county deputies, and also borough deputies. This\r\ninnovation was intended to conciliate popular favour, and\r\nLeicester did not relax in his endeavours to preserve it.\r\nRelieved from royal authority, he wished also to free himself\r\nfrom the aristocracy by whose assistance he had conquered the\r\nking. He turned his tyranny against the great barons who were not\r\npliant to his caprices. He confiscated their lands, no longer\r\nsummoned them to Parliament, and annoyed them in a thousand ways\r\nin their persons and their rights. But this was the infatuated\r\ncourse of a conqueror intoxicated by success. As soon as the\r\nroyal power and the aristocracy combined against him, Leicester\r\nwas obliged to yield.\r\n\r\n{362}\r\n\r\n              Battle Of Evesham.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of May, 1266, Prince Edward escaped from his\r\nconfinement, raised an army against Leicester, and offered him\r\nbattle on the 4th of August at Evesham. Leicester was defeated\r\nand killed in the combat. His conduct was, though factious, yet\r\ngreat and bold, so that he may be called the founder of\r\nrepresentative government in England, for, while he struggled at\r\none time against the king, at another time against the barons who\r\nwere rivals to himself, he hastened the progress of the middle\r\nclasses, and definitely established for them a place in the\r\nnational assembly.\r\n\r\nHenry, delivered from slavery by the death of Leicester,\r\nrecovered his power and used it with moderation. Several\r\nParliaments were convoked during the last years of his reign, but\r\nit is not proved that any deputies from the counties and boroughs\r\nsat in them. There is even reason for thinking that, in the midst\r\nof the disorder that then prevailed in the kingdom, the trouble\r\nof convoking them, which was always tedious and difficult, was\r\ndispensed with. The Parliament held at Winchester on the 8th of\r\nSeptember 1265, in which the confiscation of the goods of the\r\nrebels was granted to the king, was composed entirely of prelates\r\nand barons. This also was the case with regard to that which was\r\nconvened by the king at Kenilworth, the 22nd of August, 1266, in\r\nwhich, after the rigour of the confiscations had been somewhat\r\nmoderated, the Acts of Oxford were annulled, but the charters\r\nwere solemnly confirmed. Nor do we find that deputies were\r\npresent at the Parliament held at St. Edmundsbury in 1267; but\r\nthey were admitted to that held at Marlborough, convened in 1269,\r\nto which were called \"the wisest in the kingdom, as well those\r\nbelonging to a lower as to a higher rank.\" Two years afterwards\r\nthe deputies from counties and boroughs were summoned to a grand\r\nceremony, in order to transfer the remains of Edward the\r\nConfessor to a tomb which the king had caused to be prepared in\r\nWestminster Abbey. After the ceremony a Parliament assembled; but\r\nit is uncertain whether or not the deputies had a place in it.\r\nThis fact, however, does not the less prove the great importance\r\nwhich had at this time been acquired by the towns, and the habit\r\nwhich had been gradually established of summoning their deputies\r\non all great occasions.\r\n\r\n{363}\r\n\r\n         Progress Of County Representation.\r\n\r\nSuch are the facts of the reign of Henry III. which relate to the\r\nintroduction of county deputies into Parliament. No general act,\r\nno constitutional statute, called them thither. Indeed the idea\r\nof such political proceedings hardly existed at that period.\r\nNeither the government nor the people felt the need of regulating\r\nfacts in a general manner, and fixing them on an absolute basis.\r\nThe human mind had not arrived at that state of progress in which\r\nthe conception of such a design is possible. Facts spontaneously\r\ndeveloped themselves, in isolation and confusion, and according\r\nto the influence of existing circumstances. We may present a\r\nsummary exhibiting the nature of their progress, and the causes\r\nby which the representation of counties was accomplished, in the\r\nfollowing manner:--\r\n\r\nAll the king's vassals originally formed one body, and were\r\nentitled to a seat in the general assembly.\r\n\r\nThis class of proprietors became divided; some became great\r\nbarons, and continued to sit in the central assembly. Others\r\ncontinued to possess only a local influence. By this cause they\r\nwere separated from the great barons, and became united by common\r\ninterests to other free proprietors. The county courts became the\r\npoint of convergence for this new class.\r\n\r\nA struggle arose between the king and the great barons. Both of\r\nthese sought support from the class of freeholders which existed\r\nin the counties. A part of these preserved, as direct vassals of\r\nthe king, the right to take their seat in the central assembly.\r\nThe great barons certainly alone exercised this right; but as\r\ntheir tendency was to possess themselves of authority, and to\r\nidentify the great council of barons with the government, they\r\nfelt the necessity of conciliating the body of freeholders who\r\nwere vassals of the king or of themselves; and the idea of\r\ncausing them to be represented by means of election was so much\r\nthe more natural, inasmuch as elections, had often taken place in\r\nthe county courts, when there was any occasion to commit local\r\naffairs into the hands of certain proprietors. Thus the\r\ncentralization of the higher aristocracy to resist the royal\r\nauthority did of necessity involve and cause the centralization\r\nof the inferior proprietors, who could only exert their influence\r\nin the way of election.\r\n\r\n{364}\r\n\r\nLastly, the principle that consent was necessary before any\r\nimpost could be levied had prevailed; the charters established it\r\nto the advantage of the barons with regard to the king, and of\r\nthe inferior vassals in reference to their lords. The more that\r\npower became centralized either in the hands of the king or of\r\nthe assembly of barons, the more did the consent of the other\r\nproprietors to imposts also necessarily centralize itself. That\r\nwhich had previously been local became general, and the\r\ncentralization of the aristocracy of great barons involved the\r\ncentralization of the aristocracy of free proprietors.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Progress Of Borough Representation.\r\n\r\nAnother question now presents itself for examination: namely, the\r\nadmission of town and borough deputies to parliament.\r\n\r\nIn general the towns possessed, before the Norman Conquest,\r\nconsiderable wealth and importance. We have seen them take a part\r\nin political events, and interfere actively in state affairs. The\r\ncitizens of London concurred in the election of several Saxon\r\nkings; and those of Canterbury attended, under Ethelred II., at\r\nthe county court. It is, however, nearly certain that the towns\r\nnever sent deputies to the Wittenagemot. Their rights were\r\nlimited within the circle of their own walls, and when they took\r\npart in politics, it was in an accidental and irregular manner.\r\n\r\nAfter the Norman Conquest, the towns fell into decay, and lost\r\nnot only their influence on general affairs, but even their local\r\nand individual rights. Their riches vanished with the commerce\r\nwhence they had been derived, and the oppression of the\r\nconquerors completed their ruin.\r\n\r\nThey progressively recovered, especially after the reign of Henry\r\nII. At that time, considerable rights began to be granted or\r\nrather to be restored to them. The lord of the domain in which\r\nthey were situated was at first the proprietor of them, and\r\nreceived tribute from their inhabitants; but they were allowed to\r\nransom themselves from this burden by taking the town in\r\n_fee-farm_, a kind of tenure analogous to that of\r\n_socage_. Lastly, several towns obtained charters of\r\nincorporation, which gave them a more or less free municipal\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n{365}\r\n\r\nThe lord, whether king or baron, retained the right of imposing\r\ntaxes upon them at will. This right, called the right of\r\n_tallage_, was at first exercised in an entirely arbitrary\r\nway, in virtue of the very superior force possessed by the lords;\r\nbut in proportion as this superiority became enfeebled, and the\r\ntowns, on the other hand, became strong enough to defend their\r\nindependence, it was found necessary to make terms with them. In\r\norder to obtain money from them, privileges had to be granted to\r\nthem; and if they did not exact concessions of this kind, they at\r\nleast contended with their lord on behalf of their interests.\r\nThose towns especially which lay in the domain of the king, and\r\nwere the most important of all, vindicated their rights with the\r\ngreatest degree of vehemence. The royal judges had now no other\r\noccupation in their circuits than to obtain tribute from the\r\ntowns and boroughs, leaving those which could resist pretty\r\nnearly to dictate their own terms, and making arbitrary charges\r\non those which were not in a condition to defend themselves.\r\n\r\nBy these causes the admission of town deputies into the national\r\nassembly was delayed, while, on the other hand, the admission of\r\ncounty deputies was hastened. In the counties there was not that\r\nunity which is the natural characteristic of towns; there was\r\nhardly any possibility of treating separately and successively\r\nwith proprietors scattered over their domains; and in order to\r\nobtain money from them, they had to be united. It was not so in\r\nthe towns; the king dealt with them separately, made his advances\r\nupon them as they became isolated from one another, and always\r\nobliged them either to yield or to make him presents, to all\r\nappearance voluntarily.\r\n\r\nHowever, some towns early acquired sufficient importance not only\r\nto gain and defend their liberties, but also to take part in\r\ngeneral politics. Among these towns, London and the _Cinque\r\nports_ [Footnote 29] must especially be mentioned.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 29: The five towns of Dover, Sandwich, Romney,\r\n    Hastings and Hythe, were called the _Cinque ports._ ]\r\n\r\n\r\n         Borough Representation.\r\n\r\nThe importance which these possessed is established by a great\r\nnumber of facts, and we often find their inhabitants called\r\n_nobiles_ and even _barones_. Indeed, their deputies\r\nappeared sometimes at the general assembly even before the\r\nParliament of 1264, but in this there was no general principle,\r\nno public right recognized.\r\n{366}\r\nThere was this difference between the introduction into\r\nParliament of county deputies, and that of town deputies;--that\r\nthe former is associated with a right, the right of the immediate\r\nvassals of the king, and therefore possessed from the first a\r\ncharacter of generality; while the second, the introduction of\r\ntown deputies, was dissevered from every idea of right, and\r\nresulted simply from isolated facts bearing no relation to one\r\nanother. Representatives were granted to a particular town, but\r\nthis did not involve any similar concession to all towns. Hence\r\nthe arbitrariness that of necessity prevailed in the division of\r\nrepresentation among towns and boroughs. Hence the vices which\r\nstill actually exist in the electoral system of England.\r\n[Footnote 30] There remain to the present day towns of\r\nconsiderable importance which send no deputies to the House of\r\nCommons; and these abuses arise from the fact that the elections\r\nof towns and boroughs have never been regulated in a general\r\nmanner, and as public rights. In the first instance, all was\r\ndecided by a solitary fact, and the right to representation has\r\nstill continued as a right in the case of many boroughs and\r\ntowns, although the primitive fact which originally suggested the\r\nright has disappeared,--the fact, namely, of the importance of\r\nthe town or borough. Through these causes the evil of rotten\r\nboroughs was introduced into the representative system of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 30: It must not be forgotten that this course of\r\n    lectures was delivered in 1821, ten years before the passing\r\n    of the Reform Bill.]\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, not till the parliament of 1264 do we see\r\ndeputies from towns and boroughs appear in any large numbers in\r\nthe Parliament. We do not know how many towns were then called\r\nupon to exercise this right; but the writs were addressed to them\r\ndirectly, and not by the intervention of the sheriffs. This\r\ninnovation was doubtless a result of the policy of the Earl of\r\nLeicester. He had sought for protection against the king in the\r\nknights of the shires, and through these auxiliaries the king and\r\nthe royal authority had fallen into his hands; but soon finding\r\nthe want of another support against the barons, who had become\r\nhis rivals, he found it in the towns, and called upon them to\r\ntake a share in the exercise of power. This it was that rendered\r\nhis memory so popular that the king was obliged especially to\r\nforbid his being spoken of as a saint.\r\n\r\n{367}\r\n\r\n         The Mad Parliament.\r\n\r\nWe must then refer the complete formation of the English\r\nParliament to the year 1264. Its existence was still very\r\nprecarious; it rested on no law, on no public right; it was the\r\ncreation of a time of faction. The first Parliament, in which\r\nLeicester had principally ruled (the Parliament of Oxford) was\r\nsoon called the Mad Parliament,--_Parliamentum insanum_. It\r\nmight have been expected that the new form of Parliament, the\r\npresence of county and borough deputies, would have shared the\r\nsame fate as that suffered by the other institutions which were\r\nintroduced by Leicester for the purpose of organizing a purely\r\naristocratic government, and which disappeared with him. But\r\nthese rudiments of parliamentary organization were of a different\r\ncharacter; they were veritably public institutions, which,\r\ninstead of attaching themselves merely to particular interests,\r\nhad for their basis the interests of the entire population. They\r\nsurvived Leicester, and his attempts against the royal power,\r\nwhich was itself obliged to adopt them. Under the reign of Edward\r\nI. they became definitely established, and acquired a consistency\r\nand stability which would no longer allow of their being attacked\r\nwith success.\r\n\r\n{368}\r\n\r\n              Lecture XIII.\r\n\r\n  Progress of the Parliament under the reign of Edward I.\r\n\r\n  Frequent holding of Parliament.\r\n\r\n  Different composition of Parliaments.\r\n\r\n  Deputies from the counties and towns were not always present.\r\n\r\n  Discretionary power of the king in the convocation of barons.\r\n\r\n  The varying number of county and borough deputies.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Parliaments Under Edward I.\r\n\r\nGreat political institutions generally originate under feeble and\r\nincapable princes; in the midst of the troubles which arise in\r\ntheir reign, they are extorted from them. They are consolidated\r\nunder more able princes, who know how to recognize the necessity\r\nfor them, and to understand the advantages which they may derive\r\nfrom them.\r\n\r\nThis was the case in England under Henry III. and Edward I.\r\nHenry, who was entirely deficient in firmness, allowed, although\r\nquite against his inclination, all the concessions which were\r\ndemanded of him to escape from his hands; his son, who was able\r\nand energetic, instead of setting himself to destroy the\r\ninstitutions which his father had permitted to come into being,\r\nmade himself master of them, and turned them to his own\r\nadvantage. Edward I. would not perhaps have allowed them to begin\r\nin his reign; but finding them in vigorous existence, he accepted\r\nthem as they were, and instead of dreading or dispersing the new\r\nParliament, he availed himself of it as an instrument to serve\r\nand strengthen a power which he exercised with intelligence. It\r\nwas by the aid of the Parliament that Edward I. conferred, so to\r\nspeak, a national character upon his wars and conquests--\r\nenterprises which might perhaps have excited his people against\r\nhim, if he had reigned alone, and acted at once without public\r\nsupport and public control.\r\n\r\nTwo kinds of Parliament appeared under Edward I. The one kind was\r\ncomposed only of the higher barons, and seemed to form the grand\r\ncouncil of the king; in the other, deputies from counties and\r\nboroughs had a seat.\r\n\r\n{369}\r\n\r\n         Progress Of Liberal Opinions.\r\n\r\nNo legal and fixed distinction existed between these assemblies;\r\ntheir attributes were almost identical, and they often exercised\r\nthe same powers. However, the meetings of those Parliaments which\r\nwere composed only of the higher barons were very frequent; they\r\ntook place regularly four times a year. The other Parliaments, on\r\nthe contrary, were only convened on extraordinary occasions, and\r\nwhen it was necessary to obtain from the freeholders, either of\r\nthe counties or of the towns and boroughs, some general impost.\r\n\r\nThis, however, was not the only motive which could lead to the\r\nconvocation of this last mentioned assembly, which, in truth,\r\nalone deserves the name of Parliament. Whenever business arose of\r\nso great importance that the concurrence of a great number of\r\ninterests was judged necessary, the great Parliament was\r\nassembled, and by this cause its range of deliberation became\r\nmore extended, and it assumed a greater consistency.\r\n\r\nWe may infer the moral force which the Parliament had already\r\nacquired at this period, by the political maxims which were\r\ngenerally admitted. Robert of Winchelsea, Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, speaking to the Pope on behalf of the king and his\r\nbarons, addressed to him this remarkable sentiment: \"_It is the\r\ncustom of the kingdom of England that, in matters which regard\r\nthe state of that kingdom, the advice of all those interested in\r\nthe matter should be consulted_.\" [Footnote 31]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 31: \"Consuetude est regni Angliæ quod in negotiis\r\n    contingentibus statum ejusdem regni, requiritur consilium\r\n    omnium quos res tangit.\"]\r\n\r\nThere is no need that we should take this principle in its most\r\nrigorous application; it is not the fact that all those who were\r\ninterested in these matters were consulted about them; but the\r\nsentiment is still a witness of the progress which had already\r\nbeen made by the ideas of a free and public government. This\r\nprogress is still further attested by the answer which Edward\r\nhimself made to the clergy, who demanded of him the repeal of a\r\nstatute designed to restrain the accumulation of property in\r\nmortmain: \"_This statute,_\" said he, \"_had been made by\r\nthe advice of his barons, and consequently it could not be\r\nrecalled without their advice._\" [Footnote 32]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 32: \"Consilio magnatum suorum factum erat, et ideò\r\n    absque eorum consilio non erat revocandum.\"]\r\n\r\n{370}\r\n\r\n         The Commons In Parliament.\r\n\r\nIn this case, also, the principle was very far from being\r\nstrictly observed, and Edward himself, in 1281, on his own\r\nauthority, altered several of the statutes which had been passed\r\nin 1278 by the Parliament at Gloucester. Nothing therefore was\r\nmore irregular and uncertain than the rights of the public and\r\nthe forms of government at this period. Principles were professed\r\nwhich were only very partially carried into practice, and which\r\nwere often entirely neglected. But in the midst of this apparent\r\ndisorder, great institutions were gradually being formed; the\r\ninnovations of the preceding reign became habits, and these\r\nhabits, sanctioned by time, became necessities. Thus rights were\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nAs to the distinction which I have just made between the\r\ndifferent assemblies which met at this period, as they are all\r\nequally called Parliaments, and exercised at various times the\r\nmost different powers, it is difficult to fix precisely upon\r\nthose which ought to be regarded as positive Parliaments. The\r\nboundaries which separate them are contracted and often\r\nimperceptible; it would be great temerity to pretend accurately\r\nto determine what was the real character of any particular\r\nassembly, and consequently whether it ought or ought not to be\r\nregarded as a Parliament. Whenever Tory writers have not found\r\nthe presence of county and borough deputies attested by positive\r\nand official proof, such as the writs of convocation, they have\r\ndenied the fact of their presence. But this is an excessive and\r\npartial exactness: very often the chronicles of the period supply\r\nthe lack of writs, and indicate that these deputies were present.\r\nI will now point out the principal facts which have been omitted\r\nby these writers, which prove that complete Parliaments were\r\nfrequently holden.\r\n\r\nWhile Edward was still in Palestine, a Parliament was assembled\r\nin Westminster to take an oath of fidelity to the new king from\r\nthe hands of the Archbishop of York, and, according to several\r\nchroniclers, four knights from each shire and four deputies from\r\neach city were summoned thither.\r\n\r\nEdward, on his return to England, convened a new Parliament at\r\nWestminster, on the 25th of April, 1275. The preamble to the\r\nstatutes which were on that occasion decreed has been preserved:\r\nit declares that \"these statutes have been made by king Edward by\r\nthe advice of his council, and with the consent of the\r\narchbishops, bishops, abbots, priors, barons, and _of the\r\ncommonalty of the kingdom_.\"\r\n\r\n{371}\r\n\r\nIn the following year another Parliament was assembled in the\r\nsame place; it was constituted in the same manner, and, to all\r\nappearance, consisted of the same members.\r\n\r\nThe year 1283 offers many proofs of the admission of deputies\r\nfrom the Commons into Parliament. In the month of January two\r\nextraordinary assemblies were convened, one at Northampton, the\r\nother at York, to raise the forces and obtain the subsidies that\r\nwere necessary for the conquest of Wales. The writs of\r\nconvocation have been preserved: in the one case, the sheriffs\r\nwere ordered to send to Northampton all the freeholders who\r\npossessed a revenue of more than twenty pounds sterling; in the\r\nother case, they are enjoined to cause to be elected in each\r\ncounty, city, borough, and mercantile town (_villâ\r\nmercatoriâ_), four knights and townsmen having full power \"for\r\nthe whole of the commonalty.\" Lastly, in the month of June of\r\nthis same year, a Parliament met at Shrewsbury, in order to\r\ndecide on the fate of David, prince of Wales, who had been made\r\nprisoner, after the conquest of that country. The writs of\r\nconvocation are of four kinds: the first are addressed\r\nindividually to one hundred and eleven earls or barons; the\r\nsecond to the magistrates of twenty-one towns or boroughs; the\r\nthird enjoin the sheriffs to cause two knights to be elected for\r\neach county; the fourth are addressed to seventeen members of the\r\nking's privy council, among whom are the judges. Prom 1283 to\r\n1290 we meet with several Parliaments, some of which are even\r\ncelebrated by the statutes which emanated from them; however,\r\nthere is no proof that any deputies from counties and boroughs\r\nwere present at them.\r\n\r\nBut, in 1290, Edward on his return from France convened a\r\nParliament at Westminster, in which it is certain that some\r\ncounty deputies sat. A writ has been preserved dated June 14th,\r\n1290, addressed to the sheriff of Northumberland, and ordering\r\nhim to cause _two_ or _three_ knights to be elected.\r\nThere is every reason to believe that this county was not the\r\nonly one thus privileged, and that there were others which also\r\nsent deputies to this Parliament. This convocation was probably\r\nintended to enable the county deputies to pronounce concerning\r\nthe statute _Quia emptores terrarum_, which authorised the\r\nproprietors of fiefs to sell them at their discretion, and\r\nrendered the subsequent possessors direct vassals of the lord of\r\nthe fief, while the sellers ceased to be such; this removed the\r\nnecessity of sub-enfeofment, and must have considerably increased\r\nthe number of the direct vassals of the king. Boroughs were not\r\nrepresented in this Parliament: probably because the matters of\r\nwhich it treated did not immediately concern them.\r\n\r\n{372}\r\n\r\n         The First Complete Parliament.\r\n\r\nFrom 1290 to 1294 we find several Parliaments in which there is\r\nno indication that county and borough deputies had a seat. In\r\nthese Parliaments the affairs of Scotland were considered. The\r\nmagnates of the kingdom alone took part in them. In the\r\nParliament held at Westminster in the month of October, 1294,\r\nonly borough representatives are wanting; county deputies were\r\nadmitted to it; they granted to the king a tenth of the moveable\r\nwealth of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nIn the following year we find that not only the boroughs and\r\ncounties, but even the inferior clergy, exercised the right to be\r\nrepresented in the great assembly held at Westminster in the\r\nmonth of September, 1295. We possess the writs of convocation\r\naddressed to the bishops and archbishops, ordering them to cause\r\na certain number of deputies for the chapters and for the clergy\r\nto be nominated; we have also those which summon forty-nine earls\r\nor barons individually, and those which enjoin the sheriffs to\r\ncause two knights to be elected for each county, and two deputies\r\nfor each borough in the county. These boroughs were about a\r\nhundred and twenty in number. This assembly was more general in\r\nits character than any other that had as yet met; all classes of\r\nsociety had access to it, and we may truly say that the entire\r\nnation was represented. Accordingly the regular and complete\r\nestablishment of the British Parliament is generally dated from\r\nthis year, 1295.\r\n\r\nThis great assembly did not act as one single body; it was\r\ndivided into two houses, the one containing lay representatives,\r\nthe other ecclesiastical; and not only was the place of their\r\nmeeting distinct, but their votes were distinct also. The barons\r\nand knights granted to the king an eleventh of their moveable\r\nwealth; the townsmen gave a seventh, and the clergy, after long\r\ndisputes with the king, ended by only granting him a tenth, which\r\nwas the offer originally made.\r\n\r\n{373}\r\n\r\n         The Commons In Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe Parliament which was held in the month of August, 1296, was\r\nconstituted in the same way as its predecessor, and the votes in\r\nit were similarly divided. The barons and knights granted only a\r\ntwelfth part of their moveable property, and the burgesses an\r\neighth.\r\n\r\nIn 1297, a Parliament met at Salisbury, but the writs by which it\r\nwas convened are lost; we do not therefore possess any direct\r\nproof of the presence of deputies from counties and boroughs in\r\nthis assembly; however, there is extant a writ of the 30th of\r\nJuly, in the same year, in which Edward states that the towns and\r\ncounties have granted him subsidies, and this indirect proof may\r\nsupply the want of the writs of convocation.\r\n\r\nDuring this same year (1297), the quarrel broke out between the\r\naristocracy and the crown on the subject of the confirmation of\r\nthe charters, and the Earls of Norfolk and Hereford, by their\r\nbold steadfastness, secured victory for the national cause, and\r\nextorted from the king a complete and definite sanction to the\r\nrights and institutions whose maintenance they vindicated. We\r\nfind at this time that two deputies were summoned from each\r\ncounty to receive from the hands of the prince-regent those\r\ncharters which had been confirmed by the king.\r\n\r\nFrom the time when these charters were definitely confirmed, the\r\nconvocation of deputies from the counties and boroughs was no\r\nlonger an irregular and arbitrary transaction,--it became a\r\nnecessity. Accordingly, their presence in the Parliaments is\r\nconstantly attested by authentic proofs.\r\n\r\nThus they were admitted to the Parliament convened at York, on\r\nthe 15th of April, 1298; the writs of convocation of which are\r\npreserved. They were also present in the Parliament held at\r\nLincoln on the 29th of December, 1299. The writs of convocation\r\nfor this Parliament are similar to those which convened the\r\npreceding one. They summon the same deputies who had been present\r\nat the last Parliament, enjoining further that substitutes should\r\nbe chosen in the place of any who had died since that time. We\r\nfind, moreover, that writs were addressed to the chancellors of\r\nthe Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, requiring them to send\r\nto the Parliament four or five deputies in the case of Oxford,\r\nand two or three from Cambridge; and directing them to select\r\nsuch deputies from among those who were most discreet and most\r\nlearned in the law--_de discretioribus et in jure scripto magis\r\nexpertis prædictæ Universitatis_.\r\n\r\n{374}\r\n\r\n         Composition Of Parliament.\r\n\r\nLastly, the writs of convocation for the Parliament held at\r\nWestminster on the 24th of July, 1302, are in all respects\r\nsimilar to the preceding.\r\n\r\nI will not further trace this series of facts, which henceforth\r\nceases to be remarkable because of its unvarying uniformity.\r\nSuffice it to say that all the Parliaments which were held during\r\nthe last five years of the reign of Edward I. were of the same\r\nnature and composed of the same members. Two of these, however,\r\ndeserve special attention. The first is that held at Westminster\r\nin 1305. The particulars of its dissolution are preserved to us,\r\nas well as those which relate to the mode in which the petitions\r\nwhich already flowed into it were received. The second is that\r\nwhich met at Carlisle in 1307. We have the lists of the bishops,\r\nabbots, priors, earls, barons, &c., who sat in it. The number of\r\nearls or barons amounts to eighty-six, that of the bishops and\r\nabbots to sixty-eight. There were besides a great number of\r\ndeputies from the inferior clergy, forming the lower house of the\r\necclesiastical convocation; and there were, moreover, two knights\r\nfrom each county, two citizens from each city, and two burgesses\r\nfrom each borough.\r\n\r\nFrom all these facts it follows that, if at the commencement of\r\nthe fourteenth century the Parliament was not yet constituted in\r\nan actual and definite form, yet it already rested on a fixed\r\nbasis: moreover, as to its composition, we may deduce from the\r\nfacts to which I have already referred, the following results:\r\n\r\n  I. The Parliament was composed, in the _first_ place, of\r\n  earls or lay barons convened individually by the king;\r\n  _secondly_, of archbishops, bishops, abbots, and priors,\r\n  also summoned individually; _thirdly_, of deputies from\r\n  the knights or freeholders of the counties; _fourthly_, of\r\n  deputies from cities, towns, and boroughs.\r\n\r\n{375}\r\n\r\n  II. No law or statute, no ancient or recognized right,\r\n  determined who were the earls, barons, abbots, &c., whom the\r\n  king was bound to convoke individually. He acted somewhat\r\n  arbitrarily in this respect, often omitting to summon those\r\n  whom he had summoned on previous occasions. [Footnote 33] These\r\n  omissions were sometimes, though rarely, resisted by protests.\r\n  The importance of a noble and of his family was the only\r\n  guarantee of his convocation to the Parliament. Disorder, civil\r\n  wars, and confiscations, prevented this convocation from being\r\n  an incontestable and hereditary right, except in the case of a\r\n  permanent feudal tenure.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 33: Thus Edward summoned to the Parliament of\r\n    Shrewsbury (1283) a hundred and eleven earls or barons; to\r\n    the Parliament of Westminster (1295), he only summoned\r\n    fifty-three; and out of the hundred and eleven who were\r\n    present in 1283, sixty were absent in 1295. The latter\r\n    Parliaments of his reign furnish several instances of similar\r\n    irregularities. Thus we find at this time ninety-eight lay\r\n    _proceres_ who were only once summoned to the\r\n    Parliament, and fifty who were summoned once, twice, or three\r\n    times. There was a distinction among the barons who were\r\n    summoned individually: some were summoned by virtue of their\r\n    feudal tenure, others, only in virtue of the writ of\r\n    convocation, whether they were or were not immediate vassals\r\n    of the king. These last exercised in the Parliament the same\r\n    rights as the former, only it does not appear that the sole\r\n    fact of a writ of convocation conferred upon them a\r\n    hereditary right. There are even several examples of\r\n    ecclesiastical peers who were convened by special writs, and\r\n    who obtained a discharge from the obligation to attend the\r\n    Parliament by proving that they held no fief of the king. The\r\n    practice of creating barons or peers was of later\r\n    introduction: _first_, by a statute of the Parliament\r\n    (under Edward III.); _secondly_, by letters patent from\r\n    the king (under Richard II.).]\r\n\r\n  III. The principal functionaries of the king, such as the\r\n  judges and members of the privy council, were almost always\r\n  convened to the Parliament by virtue of their official\r\n  position; indeed, they were uniformly either earls or barons.\r\n\r\n  IV. The convocation of county and borough deputies was not a\r\n  legal or public necessity; but it became an actual necessity by\r\n  the predominance of the principle that consent in all matters\r\n  of impost was a right.\r\n\r\n  V. The convocation of county deputies was more certain and\r\n  regular than that of borough deputies; more certain, because it\r\n  originated partly in a right which had not then been questioned,\r\n  and which it was necessary to respect, the right, namely, of\r\n  every immediate vassal to a seat in the general assembly; more\r\n  regular, because the county courts, which were all composed of\r\n  the same elements and possessed of the same interests,\r\n  constituted a uniform and identical whole throughout England,\r\n  so that some could not be admitted to the privilege of\r\n  representation without all the rest being admitted also.\r\n{376}\r\n  As the towns and boroughs, on the other hand, only owed their\r\n  admission into Parliament to varying causes without unity or\r\n  connexion with each other, and were only called to assist in\r\n  matters which concerned themselves individually; so the\r\n  admission of a representative from one town did not at all\r\n  involve the admission of representatives from other towns, nor\r\n  even the continuance of this privilege in any one case.\r\n\r\n  VI. The number of town and borough deputies was not fixed. The\r\n  king determined this arbitrarily. Nevertheless the convocation\r\n  of two deputies for each county, and as many for each borough,\r\n  passed into a rule.\r\n\r\n  VII. However irregular the convocation of borough deputies\r\n  might be, there is no reason to think that the number of\r\n  boroughs which were then represented in the assembly was as\r\n  limited as has been assumed; there is no reason to think, as\r\n  has been maintained by Tory historians, that only towns in the\r\n  domains of the king originally sent deputies to Parliament. The\r\n  assumption is, on the contrary, contradicted by facts which\r\n  prove that, besides the towns belonging to the royal domain,\r\n  those which had received a charter of incorporation, either\r\n  from the king or from some great baron, were represented; as\r\n  were also those which, without having received any such\r\n  charter, were rich enough to pay the expenses of their\r\n  deputies. However, the importance of particular towns, and the\r\n  necessity that was felt for their concurrence in public\r\n  business, was in this respect the only rule; and most\r\n  frequently, the choice of the towns which should be represented\r\n  was left to the arbitrary decision of the sheriffs.\r\n\r\n{377}\r\n\r\n              Lecture XIV.\r\n\r\n  Mode of election of the deputies of counties and boroughs.\r\n\r\n  Who were the electors?\r\n\r\n  No uniform principle to regulate elections in boroughs and\r\n  towns.\r\n\r\n  Voting in public.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Who Were The Electors?\r\n\r\nWe have seen how county and borough deputies were introduced into\r\nParliament; but we are still far from having obtained a complete\r\nand correct idea of representative government as it existed in\r\nEngland at the period at which we have now arrived. We have yet\r\nto learn by whom and in what manner these members were\r\nnominated--in a word, what was then the electoral system, if we\r\nmay be allowed to give this name to a collection of isolated\r\ncustoms and institutions unconnected with each other, and almost\r\nentirely destitute of any generality or unity of character.\r\n\r\nThe two political parties, whose opposition and debates are met\r\nwith at every step in the study of English institutions, have not\r\nfailed to resolve this question, each in a different manner. The\r\nTories, always disposed to limit the boundaries of public\r\nliberty, maintain that the introduction of county members into\r\nParliament arose primarily from the impossibility of uniting in\r\nthe general assembly all the direct vassals of the king, the\r\nwhole body of whom alone had the right to be present; and that\r\nlandowners of this class were originally the sole electors of\r\nthese representatives. The Whigs assert, on the other hand, that\r\nall the freeholders in the county, whether direct or indirect\r\nvassals of the king, have always taken part in this election.\r\n\r\nI shall seek the solution of this question exclusively in the\r\nfacts which have special reference to the introduction of county\r\nmembers into Parliament; and as this change has been the result\r\nnot of secondary or unforeseen circumstances, but of the natural\r\ncourse of time and of events, it is needful first to call to mind\r\nthe general facts which preceded it and gave it birth.\r\n\r\n{378}\r\n\r\n         Origin Of County Freeholders.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that, a large number of the direct vassals of the\r\nking having very early renounced, on account of their small\r\nwealth or influence, their attendance at the general assembly,\r\ntheir political existence became localized and restricted to\r\ncounty affairs, and to attendance at the county court, at which\r\nthose affairs were transacted. The direct vassals of the king,\r\nhowever, were not the only persons interested in the affairs of\r\nthe county. Many other freeholders, whether vassals of the great\r\nbarons or originally simple socagers, possessed considerable\r\nwealth and influence; [Footnote 34] and as actual possession at\r\nthis period was almost the only arbiter of right, there is little\r\ndoubt, _à priori_, that all the freeholders of any\r\nimportance in the county were then admitted to the county-court,\r\nto direct the administration of justice and to discuss their\r\ncommon interests.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 34: It may be seen in the Black Book of the\r\n    Exchequer that Godfrey Fitzwilliam, in Buckinghamshire, held\r\n    twenty-seven knights' fiefs of Earl Walter Gifford, whilst\r\n    Guilbon Bolbech, in the same county, held of the king only\r\n    one knight's fief.]\r\n\r\nThese probabilities are changed into absolute facts by the\r\ntestimony of history. It is proved that the knights, who were\r\ndirect vassals of the king, did not alone compose the\r\ncounty-courts. From the time of William the Conqueror to the end\r\nof the reign of Edward I. a multitude of deeds, laws, writs, and\r\nhistoric records prove that all the freeholders, or nearly all,\r\nsat in these courts; and that if there were some exceptions to\r\nthis rule, they did not in the least proceed from any general\r\ndistinction between the direct or indirect vassals of the king,\r\nbut merely from particular conditions imposed on individual\r\ntenures. For it does not appear that all freemen-landholders were\r\nequally compelled to make their appearance at the county-courts,\r\nas this service was esteemed a burden rather than a privilege.\r\n\r\nIt may then be regarded as certain, that either by the fall of\r\nmany of the direct vassals of the king, or by the elevation of a\r\ngreat number of the simple vassals of the nobles, there had\r\narisen in every county a body of freeholders, all of whom, in\r\nreference to the affairs of the county, and independently of the\r\nnature of their feudal relations, possessed the same importance\r\nand equal rights.\r\n\r\n{379}\r\n\r\n         Functions Of The County Courts.\r\n\r\nThe county-courts, thus composed, exercised the right of election\r\nlong before the regular and definitive introduction of their\r\nrepresentatives into Parliament. Here officers invested with the\r\npowers necessary for the transaction of the county business were\r\nsometimes elected; and sometimes knights were appointed to\r\nexecute the measures of the central government, or sent thither\r\nas bearers of complaints or representations. Instances of such\r\nelections are numerous. The charters have frequently prescribed\r\nthem, and they are continually spoken of in the chronicles.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be affirmed that this appointment of particular knights\r\nfor the transaction of specific local business was always\r\nconducted in a regular manner and by a distinct election. It was\r\nsometimes done by the sheriffs alone: but it is certain that most\r\ngenerally it took place \"by the community of the county, with the\r\nconsent and by the advice of the county, _per communitatem\r\ncomitatûs, de assensu et consilio comitatûs_.\"\r\n\r\nWe gather from all these facts, first, that before the\r\nintroduction of county-members into Parliament, the direct\r\nvassals of the king, who, on account of their inferior\r\nimportance, had ceased to attend at the general assembly, did not\r\nform a distinct body in the county-courts, or a particular class\r\nof landowners invested with peculiar rights; but that, on the\r\ncontrary, they were merged in the general class of freeholders,\r\nnearly all of whom also attended the county-court, and there\r\nexercised the same rights; and, secondly, it is unquestionable\r\nthat this assembly of freeholders was in the habit, in certain\r\ncases, of appointing some one of its members either for the\r\nmanagement of the county business, or for any other purpose.\r\n\r\nAre we to believe that when the object in view was sending\r\nrepresentatives of the county to Parliament, there was\r\nsubstituted, in place of the existing order of things, a new\r\norder by which to elect them? or, in other words, that those\r\nfreeholders, who, though direct vassals of the king, were on the\r\nsame footing with the other freeholders as regarded all the\r\noperations of the county-court, were distinguished from them by\r\nbeing alone called upon to elect members of Parliament? Nothing\r\nis less probable in itself, and in fact nothing is less true than\r\nthat there was such a disorganization of the county-courts at\r\nelection times.\r\n\r\n{380}\r\n\r\n         Rights Of The Freeholders.\r\n\r\nIt is not at all probable, because, in the state of society at\r\nthis period, the _status quo_ almost always ruled. We are\r\ngreatly deceived if we expect to find the institutions of the\r\ntime under the sway of some general rule, and issuing in the\r\ninevitable consequences of a principle. There was no such\r\ndominant general rule or principle. When a new law appears, it is\r\nthe product of facts, not of a theory. When any new demand is\r\nmade upon society, it is society in its actual condition, and not\r\na systematically constituted society, which replies to the\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\nThe freeholders in general formed the county-court on every\r\noccasion, and took part in all its acts. What reason could there\r\nbe for suddenly setting aside an established custom in order to\r\ncreate a privilege in favour of certain landowners whose\r\nposition, although special in some respects, was but little\r\ndistinguished from that of others? Was there any occasion for an\r\nact so unusual that it could not be put in force without\r\nsubverting the customs then in vogue? There was none: on the\r\ncontrary, this act appeared to the county landowners as only\r\nanother circumstance allied to the many existing facts of the\r\nsame description: they neither foresaw all the importance which\r\nthis fact could not fail to acquire, nor all the consequences to\r\nwhich it would necessarily lead. This election of knights\r\nsummoned to Parliament, although somewhat more important than\r\nother elections, resembled all those which were frequently made\r\nin the county-court, and in which every freeholder took part. Why\r\nshould the right of voting on such occasions have belonged\r\nexclusively to particular individuals among them? Were they not\r\nall equally interested, as the majority of the taxes were levied\r\non their personal property; and the principal duty of the\r\ndeputies was the settlement of the taxes? How is it possible to\r\nbelieve otherwise than that this, like every other election, was\r\nmade by all the members of the county-court without distinction?\r\n\r\nFacts, I repeat, confirm these probabilities. The writs addressed\r\nto the sheriffs by the king for the election of county members,\r\nare conceived in the same terms as those issued for elections\r\nrelating exclusively to the administration of local affairs.\r\n\r\n{381}\r\n\r\n         Forty-Shilling Freeholders.\r\n\r\nThey equally set forth that these knights shall be elected with\r\nthe assent of the community of the county, _de assensu\r\ncommunitatis comitatûs_. Further, the returns of the sheriffs\r\ndeclare that the election has been made \"in full county, by the\r\nwhole of the community of the county,\" _in pleno comitatu, per\r\ntotam communitatem comitatûs._ Under the succeeding reigns,\r\nterms yet more formal were employed; thus, about the middle of\r\nthe reign of Edward III. the writs contain, that the election\r\nought to be made \"according to the will, and with the consent, of\r\nthe men of the county,\" _de arbitrio et consensu hominum\r\ncomitatûs_. Finally, facts which have come down to us from\r\nlater times prove that all freeholders possessed an equal right\r\nof participation in these elections. In 1405, a statute of Henry\r\nIV., intended to prevent certain abuses committed on these\r\noccasions by sheriffs under the preceding reign, orders among\r\nother things, that \"all those who should be present at the\r\ncounty-court, even when they had not been duly summoned thither\r\nby the sheriff, should take part in the election.\" Lastly, under\r\nHenry VI., the great number of the freeholders having given rise\r\nto many disturbances during the elections, two statutes (the\r\nfirst issued in 1429, and the second in 1432) limited the right\r\nof suffrage to freeholders possessing an annual income of forty\r\nshillings: this was the first and last limitation of the kind,\r\nand it still continues to subsist in England.\r\n\r\nThus, moral probabilities and historical facts alike indicate,\r\nthat since the origin of the Parliament in its actual form, the\r\nrepresentatives of counties have been elected not only by the\r\ndirect vassals of the king, but by all the freeholders, whether\r\nmediate or immediate vassals, who composed the county court. In\r\norder definitively to establish this opinion, nothing remains but\r\nto examine the proofs that are alleged in favour of the opposite\r\nopinion. These may be reduced to two: first, it is said, that as\r\nthe direct vassals of the king alone possessed originally the\r\nright of sitting in the general assembly, and as the election of\r\nknights of the shire arose entirely from the impossibility of\r\nassembling in Parliament all the direct vassals of the king, the\r\nlatter alone must have been the electors of the representatives\r\nwho were sent in their place. Secondly, the vassals of the barons\r\nlong demanded exemption from the obligation of contributing to\r\nthe payment of the fees allotted to the county members, which\r\nproves that they could not have shared in the election; for had\r\nthey done so their claim would have been absurd.\r\n\r\n{382}\r\n\r\n         Refutation Of Tory Theories.\r\n\r\nBoth these proofs have the fault of being indirect, and of\r\nresting upon consequences deduced from general facts, and not\r\nupon special and positive facts, such as those I have just\r\nadduced in support of the contrary opinion. Moreover, the first\r\nargument supposes the existence of a general and absolute\r\nprinciple which was invariably followed; and that the county\r\nmembers were summoned to Parliament only to represent the direct\r\nvassals of the king. This supposition is neither probable nor\r\nconformable to facts. We again repeat, that there was at this\r\nperiod no general principle, no fixed and invariable rule.\r\nGeneral principles and their consequences exist only in a calm\r\nand settled state of society; they are incompatible with a rude\r\npopulation and long-continued disorder. How, then, could social\r\nclassifications and their corresponding rights have remained\r\nfixed and distinct in the midst of such chaotic confusion?\r\nBesides, the feudal system never exercised such complete sway in\r\nEngland as to insure anything like a strict observance of its\r\nprinciples. It is true that the right possessed by all the direct\r\nvassals of the king to appear in the central assembly, was one of\r\nthe sources of county representation; but when this right, after\r\nhaving fallen into desuetude, began to revive in the persons of\r\nrepresentatives, it was outweighed by an actual and more powerful\r\ncircumstance, the formation of the general class of freeholders,\r\nmeeting at the county-court, and there exercising the same\r\nfunctions and equal rights. This fact is incontestible; so the\r\nTories are compelled to acknowledge that the deputies were\r\nelected by all present at the county-court. But how do they\r\nattempt to escape from the consequences of this confession? They\r\nmaintain that the direct vassals alone sat in the county-court:\r\nan opinion too much opposed to the nature of things and to all\r\nthe facts which I have brought forward, to require refutation.\r\n\r\n{383}\r\n\r\nThere is another difficulty which perplexes Tory writers, and\r\nwhich they are equally unsuccessful in their attempts to\r\nsurmount. It is impossible for them to deny that under the reigns\r\nsubsequent to that of Edward I., and especially under Henry IV.,\r\nall the freeholders in the county took part in the election: now,\r\nto avoid this embarrassment, it is pretended, that taking\r\nadvantage of the disorder of the times they had usurped the right\r\nof suffrage, and that the statute of Henry IV. (in 1405) for the\r\nfirst time legalized this abuse, and lawfully summoned the\r\nfreeholders to the election of deputies. There is no probability\r\nin this supposition, which is not supported by a single fact.\r\nBetween the reigns of Edward I. and Henry IV., nothing can be\r\ndiscovered which indicates the usurpation of the electoral right\r\nby a portion of the freeholders who had remained till then\r\nstrangers to the election. No trace of change in the composition\r\nof the county-courts is to be found, nor any alteration in the\r\nform or language of the writs of convocation. Everything\r\nindicates, on the contrary, that the elections continued to be\r\nconducted as in former times; and that the statute of Henry IV.\r\nhas evidently no other object than to prevent the illegal\r\npractices of the sheriffs, which had become scandalous under the\r\nreign of Richard II. Thus, in whatever light it is viewed, this\r\nfirst argument is utterly valueless.\r\n\r\n\r\n           Payment Of Representatives.\r\n\r\nThe second is of no greater worth. It is founded upon the\r\nsupposition that those only who have a voice in the election of\r\nrepresentatives ought to contribute to the payment of their\r\nsalary. Now this supposition is explicitly contradicted by a writ\r\nof Edward III., which proves that even the _villani_, the\r\nsimple husbandmen, who certainly took no part in the election,\r\nwere required to contribute to the payment of the fees. If it\r\nappear, then, that the freeholders demanded release from this\r\nimpost, it cannot thence be concluded that they had no share in\r\nthe election.\r\n\r\nIn these demands there is nothing extraordinary. The office of\r\nmember of Parliament was originally more an onerous burden than\r\nan advantage. The person elected was compelled to give security\r\nto guarantee his attendance at the assembly. A curious instance\r\nis mentioned of an elected knight who could not find the required\r\nbail; the sheriffs, therefore, seized his oxen and farm-horses to\r\ncompel him to fulfil the duties of his office. In a short time,\r\nto render the charge less onerous it was made lucrative: fees\r\nbeing awarded to the representatives. These fees were levied on\r\nthe entire county, with the exception of certain particular\r\nimmunities.\r\n{384}\r\nA writ of Edward III. proves this distinctly. It is true that the\r\nvassals of the barons, chiefly under the reign of Edward III.,\r\nmade frequent claims of exemption from payment of the salaries\r\ndue to the members: but these were not founded upon the\r\ncircumstance that they had had no share in the election; they\r\nrested on a pretext derived from feudal law, maintaining that, as\r\ntheir lords sat in Parliament in their own right, that is to say,\r\nin their quality of peers, they were represented by them, and\r\nought not to pay the salaries of the county representatives. It\r\nis evident that these claims proceeded from confusing ideas of\r\nthe ancient feudal representation (a fiction which rendered the\r\nnoble in some sort the proxy of his vassals) with ideas of the\r\nnew system of representation. These facts in no way prove that\r\nthe vassals of the barons took no part in the election of the\r\ncounty members; all that they indicate is that the collection of\r\nthe members' salaries was very arbitrary, and was regulated by\r\ndifferent customs in each county; no conclusion can, however, be\r\ndrawn from them relative to electoral rights.\r\n\r\nNow that I have reduced to their just value these two arguments,\r\nthe sole support of the opinion which I oppose, it appears very\r\nnearly certain that all the freeholders who attended the\r\ncounty-court united in the election of the representatives,\r\nwhatever might be the nature of their feudal relation to the\r\ncrown.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Election Of Borough Representatives.\r\n\r\nHaving completed our researches into the election of county\r\nmembers, let us next examine how the election of the\r\nrepresentatives of boroughs was conducted.\r\n\r\nAlthough in the county-courts no fixed rule nor systematic\r\ndistinction regulated the distribution of electoral rights, there\r\nwas at least something general and identical in them throughout\r\nEngland. The counties were territorial districts of the same\r\nnature; the county-courts, wherever situated, were the same\r\ninstitution, and the freeholders formed one class of men. Out of\r\ncircumstances nearly everywhere alike, there naturally arose an\r\nelectoral system in all places the same.\r\n\r\n{385}\r\n\r\nIt was not, nor could it be thus with respect to the boroughs.\r\nThey had acquired their liberties successively to a greater or\r\nless extent, and under a thousand different forms. The political\r\nstate of one town gives no clue to that of other towns, as they\r\nwere not at all correspondent to one another. Sometimes the\r\nmunicipal rights belonged to the more or less numerous\r\ncorporation which held the town in _fee-farm_; sometimes to\r\nthe general body of freeholders who held their houses in\r\n_burgage-tenure_, a kind of tenure analogous to the tenure\r\nin _socage_; sometimes to the entire body of householders;\r\noccasionally, but more rarely, to the whole of the inhabitants.\r\nWhen any particular borough was summoned to send deputies to\r\nParliament, it occurred to no one to consider this new right as\r\ndistinct from their municipal rights, and to regulate the\r\nelectoral system on a separate basis. This summons had reference\r\nto the borough in its existing condition, and did not introduce\r\nthe slightest innovation into the exercise of the civic\r\nauthority. The citizens who, in virtue of their charter, enjoyed\r\nthe right of managing the affairs of the borough, also exercised\r\nthat of naming its representatives. There was then nothing\r\ngeneral or uniform in the foundation of this new right, and it\r\nwould be impossible to reduce the elections in towns and boroughs\r\nto any common principle. We can only examine a number of\r\nparticular facts, and derive from them the following results:--\r\n\r\n  I. The political right of electing members of Parliament was\r\n  not distinct from the municipal rights of the borough, and was\r\n  exercised in the same manner and by the same citizens.\r\n\r\n  II. From this it follows that the election was commonly made by\r\n  the council, who directed the local interests of the borough:\r\n  the number of electors, therefore, was very limited at the\r\n  outset.\r\n\r\n  III. Where a corporation held a town in _fee-farm_, it\r\n  also possessed the right of appointing the members of\r\n  Parliament. These corporations were generally composed of a few\r\n  individuals.\r\n\r\n  IV. As the freeholders of many boroughs sat in the\r\n  county-courts, not a few of the elections of borough members\r\n  took place originally in these very county-courts, and by the\r\n  borough freeholders who repaired thither, and who exercised\r\n  this power either on their own account, or as authorized by\r\n  their fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\n{386}\r\n\r\n  V. The writs or orders for the election of deputies were at\r\n  first addressed directly to the borough magistrates themselves.\r\n  This, at least, was the case in 1264, the period of the first\r\n  convocation with which we are acquainted of the representatives\r\n  of boroughs under Henry III. In 1283, the same procedure was\r\n  followed by Edward I. for the convocation of the Shrewsbury\r\n  Parliament, to which the representatives of twenty-one boroughs\r\n  were summoned. In 1295, the writs were addressed to the\r\n  sheriffs of the counties in which the boroughs were situated,\r\n  and from that period, this has been the habitual and legal form\r\n  of convening the boroughs. In 1352 and 1353, however, Edward\r\n  III. addressed his writs directly to the municipal magistrates,\r\n  on the first occasion for ten boroughs, and on the second for\r\n  thirty-eight. These are the last examples of similar\r\n  convocations. The Cinque-ports remained the only boroughs which\r\n  received the writs directly.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Corruption Of Borough Representation.\r\n\r\nThese facts explain how borough-representation has been so easily\r\ncorrupted in England, and remains so disgraceful to this day.\r\n[Footnote 35] In every town political rights have remained\r\nrestricted to the municipal bodies, who, originally, were usually\r\ncomprised in a very narrow circle. The general tendency has been\r\never since, and especially at the period of the revolution of\r\n1640, to extend electoral rights in boroughs, and thus to render\r\nthe election more popular; but, on the whole, the choice is\r\ninvariably made by the municipal powers, organized according to\r\ntheir ancient charters of incorporation. In the counties,\r\nelectoral rights have adapted themselves to all the vicissitudes\r\nof property, and have become proportionably extended: in the\r\nboroughs, they have remained unaltered. Every unchangeable\r\ninstitution is vicious, because ultimately it will be sure to\r\nestablish privileges in opposition to the actual state of\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 35: Before the reform of Parliament in 1832.]\r\n\r\nI should wish to be able to add to these researches into the\r\nelectoral system of England in the thirteenth century some\r\nparticular and circumstantial details concerning the forms of\r\nelections; but nothing can be discovered on this subject, either\r\nin history or in the laws. The laws did not mention the matter,\r\nbecause at this stage of civilization it is not thought that such\r\nthings require to be either regulated or expressed.\r\n{387}\r\nIt is probable that the electors, who were generally very few in\r\nnumber, agreed among themselves, in presence of the sheriff, on\r\nthe representatives they wished to appoint; and that the sheriff,\r\nby a writ, informed the Court of Chancery of the nomination. The\r\nonly important circumstance in this mode of election was the open\r\nvoting, which has been perpetuated to this day. Nobody then\r\nattached sufficient importance to his choice to think concealment\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Forms Of Borough Elections.\r\n\r\nUntil the reign of Henry IV., we do not find any law respecting\r\nthe forms of election. In proportion as the elections became\r\nimportant, the sheriffs, profiting by the absence of all forms,\r\ntook the matter into their own hands, and managed it agreeably to\r\ntheir own will. The law to which I refer was passed in order to\r\nprevent these abuses. Here, as everywhere, the organization of\r\nsureties took place long after the recognition and exercise of\r\nrights.\r\n\r\n{388}\r\n\r\n              Lecture XV.\r\n\r\n  Philosophical examination of the electoral system in England in\r\n  the fourteenth century.\r\n\r\n  The system was the natural result of facts.\r\n\r\n  Who were the electors?\r\n\r\n  Four principles which determine the solution of this question.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Character Of The English Electoral System.\r\n\r\nThe facts adduced in my previous lecture, prove that the\r\nelectoral system of England in the fourteenth century was\r\ndetermined by no philosophical combination, by no general\r\nintention. This system arose naturally and spontaneously, out of\r\nfacts. Its study is therefore more curious and interesting:\r\nmodern times are full of science and artifice; institutions do\r\nnot now become developed with simplicity and freedom; under the\r\npretext of giving them regularity, things are distorted, to suit\r\nsome particular interest, or to accommodate a theory. Nothing of\r\nthis nature occurred in the formation of the British Parliament;\r\nscience did not then exist, and cunning was unnecessary. The\r\nHouse of Commons was not of sufficient importance for the\r\nexecutive to be much disturbed about its origin; the office of\r\nmember for a county or borough was not enough sought after to\r\ninduce different interests and parties to direct all their\r\ninstruments of warfare and stratagems of policy to this end.\r\nRepresentatives of the country were required, who were to be\r\nchosen by the method of election--but this election had no\r\noccasion to adapt itself to a theory, or to be false in any way.\r\nIn such a state of society, the electoral system might be vicious\r\nand incomplete in a thousand ways; its forms might be irregular\r\nand destitute of all needful guarantees, but its general\r\nprinciples would be natural and sound. These principles are what\r\nI propose to seek after, and to bring to light, in the present\r\nLectures. They were neither known or thought of in the fourteenth\r\ncentury, but they exist in facts; for there is a reason for every\r\nfact, and all are subject to certain laws. Before entering upon\r\nthe ancient English electoral system, singly and in itself, we\r\nshould first consider it in its relations to society in general,\r\nto the powers by which it was ruled, and to the liberties which\r\nit enjoyed.\r\n\r\n{389}\r\n\r\n         Modern Political Science.\r\n\r\nIn the present day, political science has rarely considered\r\nquestions in this point of view, though it is the first and most\r\nimportant of all; it has operated on society and its government\r\nby a process of dissection; it has taken all powers and rights\r\none by one, and has endeavoured to define each separately, and\r\nwith regard to itself alone; seeking first completely to disjoin\r\nthem from one another, and then to make them to proceed together,\r\nconfining each strictly to its own sphere. In this manner have we\r\nseen enumerated the legislative power, the executive power, the\r\nelectoral power, the judicial power, and the administrative\r\npower, and every effort of science has been exerted to make these\r\ndifferent powers co-exist, while maintaining among them a\r\nrigorous distinction, and enjoining upon them never to fall into\r\nconfusion, nor even to assimilate their offices and action. The\r\nsame system has been applied to the rights and liberties of\r\ncitizens. It is easy here to discern the triumph of the fondness\r\nfor analysis which characterized the last century. But analysis\r\nis a method of study, not of creation. The spirit of analysis is\r\nscientific, but never political. In politics, whether dealing\r\nwith rights or powers, the object is to create real vital forces,\r\ncapable either of enforcing obedience or resisting oppression.\r\nThis can never be attained by analysis; for, in reality, actual\r\nlife is a very complicated matter, requiring the union and\r\namalgamation of a multitude of different elements, each modified\r\nand sustained by the others. Analysis elucidates and separates\r\ninto parts, but never constructs. This truth is demonstrated by\r\nthe political history of our own time. All these powers and\r\nrights, so carefully enumerated and distinguished by science, so\r\nnarrowly enclosed within specified limits, were found in the time\r\nof action to be destitute of consistency, energy, and reality. It\r\nwas decreed that the legislative power should be absolutely\r\nseparated from the executive power, the judicial power from the\r\nadministrative, the municipal from the electoral power: liberties\r\nand rights have been isolated and dissected just in the same way\r\nas powers; and ere long all these rights and powers, incapable of\r\nexistence and action in their isolated condition, have become\r\ncentralized or lost in the hand of an individual or collective\r\ndespotism, which alone was powerful and real, because it alone\r\nwas other than a theoretic design or a scientific conception.\r\n\r\n{390}\r\n\r\nIt may be fearlessly affirmed that rights, like public powers,\r\nwill never regain reality and energy until they escape from this\r\npretended science, which, under the pretext of classifying,\r\nenervates and nullifies them; until, united by positive ties,\r\nthey mutually rest on one another, and coalesce to bring about\r\nthe same results. Doubtless, the great analytical labour\r\nperformed in our own time will not prove fruitless; many well\r\ngrounded distinctions and necessary limitations will be\r\nmaintained; all powers will not again fall into general\r\nconfusion, nor will all rights become concentrated. There is some\r\ntruth and usefulness in the results of the social dissection\r\nwhich has been performed; but if it were to be perpetuated, if\r\nrights and powers were to remain in the state of isolation and\r\ndissolution in which science has placed them at the present day,\r\nwe should never possess either government or freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Object Of The British Parliament.\r\n\r\nIt is very evident that nothing of this kind occurred at the\r\nperiod of the formation of the British Parliament. Politics did\r\nnot wear so scientific a character, nor lay claim to such\r\nconsideration, as at present. It was necessary to summon together\r\nthe principal men in the kingdom--merchants, landowners, and\r\nothers--that they might assist in particular public business. But\r\nthis was never imagined to be the creation of a new right, or of\r\na new power. Established rights and existing powers were called\r\nupon to exercise this new function, and to appear under this new\r\nform. The freeholders, that is to say, every free and veritable\r\nlandowner, used to assemble in the county-courts, to administer\r\njustice and to treat together of common interests; and these\r\ncounty-courts were charged with the nomination of\r\nrepresentatives. In towns of any importance, the citizens, under\r\nforms more or less liberal, regulated their own affairs, chose\r\ntheir own magistrates, and exercised in common certain rights and\r\npowers; and these municipal corporations were required to send\r\nmembers to Parliament.\r\n\r\n{391}\r\n\r\n         Combination Of Public Rights.\r\n\r\nThus, the assemblies which we now designate electoral colleges\r\nwere never at that period, as they now are, special and isolated\r\nassemblies, invested with a temporary duty, and in all other\r\nrespects unconnected with the administration of the country.\r\nCounty courts and municipal corporations, which were already\r\nfirmly planted and established, and possessed inherent strength,\r\nwere constituted into electoral colleges. Thus the electoral\r\nsystem from its origin was united with every right and\r\ninstitution, and with almost every local and real power. It was\r\nthe extension and development of existing liberties, a powerful\r\nforce added to other forces previously in action and exercising\r\ngovernment over other interests. It was not that in one place\r\nthere were merely electors, in another administrators, and\r\nelsewhere judges; but there was a body of citizens who\r\nparticipated in the administration of local affairs, and in\r\nrendering justice; and who elected deputies for the transaction\r\nof general business. It is easily understood that,--being thus\r\ndeeply rooted in the community at large, and closely united to\r\nall other powers--the electoral power (to employ the language of\r\nthe present day) was defended from every vicissitude through\r\nwhich we have seen it pass, when attempts have been made to\r\nestablish it, by itself, in some particular aspect or\r\ncombination.\r\n\r\nThis then is the first characteristic of the electoral system\r\nwhich occupies our attention. We need not hesitate to elevate\r\nthis characteristic into a principle, and to assert that where it\r\nis not met with, election, that is to say, representative\r\ngovernment itself, will be either powerless or harassed by\r\ncontinual storms.\r\n\r\nIt is an error in modern politics immoderately to fear power,\r\nwhatever may be its form or situation. It is divided and\r\nsubdivided infinitesimally, until it no longer exists, so to\r\nspeak, except as powder. This is not the way to establish\r\nliberty. Liberty cannot exist except by the possession of rights,\r\nand rights are worthless if they are not themselves powers--vital\r\nand strongly constituted powers. Placing right on one side and\r\npower on the other is not constituting a free government, but\r\nestablishing a permanent tyranny, sometimes under the name of\r\ndespotism, and sometimes under that of revolution; the problem is\r\nto place power everywhere in the hands of right, which can only\r\nbe done by organizing or accepting at once, in the very centre of\r\nthe government, and in every stage of its action, authority and\r\nresistance.\r\n{392}\r\nNow resistance is only real and effectual when capable on all\r\noccasions of opposition to authority, when authority is compelled\r\nto treat with it at all times, to conquer or to yield. What then\r\nis the electoral right or power, if so it is called, when\r\nisolated from every other power? Its exercise is transient and\r\ninfrequent; it is the crisis of a day imposed upon actual\r\nauthority, which may, it is true, be defeated, but which, if it\r\nescapes, is afterwards perfectly free, and continues its course\r\nwithout the least obstruction, or sleeps in blind security. If,\r\non the other hand, the electoral right is supported by other\r\nrights of more direct and frequent occurrence, if the electoral\r\nsystem is closely interwoven with the whole government, if the\r\nsame citizens who have nominated the members, interfere in the\r\naffairs of the country under other forms but by the same title,\r\nif the central authority needs on other occasions their assent\r\nand support, if it finds them elsewhere also grouped and united\r\nfor the exercise of other functions of power, then all rights\r\nserve as guarantees to one another; the electoral system is no\r\nlonger suspended in air, and it becomes difficult to violate it\r\nin principle, or to elude it in its consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Independence Of Public Rights.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to doubt that to this close union of electoral\r\nrights, with a multitude of other public and local rights, the\r\nelectoral system is indebted in England for its strength and\r\npermanence. One fact among a thousand others will prove this.\r\nWhen the central power, finding itself threatened by the\r\nelections, has endeavoured to rid itself of their influence, it\r\nhas been compelled to withdraw from the towns and corporations,\r\ntheir charters and liberties. Without this nothing could have\r\nbeen done. But by this also, everything was attacked, and liberty\r\nand right being everywhere emperilled, the nation put forth its\r\nefforts not only to re-establish a House of Commons, but also to\r\nregain a multitude of other rights which had no reference to the\r\nelection of representatives. It is the secret of good\r\nconstitutional legislation, thus to unite all rights with each\r\nother in such a manner that it is impossible to weaken any one of\r\nthem without endangering all.\r\n\r\nThis characteristic of the British electoral system has also\r\nproduced, in regard to the elections themselves, other\r\nconsequences no less felicitous, which I shall presently\r\nindicate. I shall now consider this system in itself, in its\r\ninterior organization.\r\n\r\n{393}\r\n\r\n         Two Classes Of Electors.\r\n\r\nAll the elements and laws of every electoral system resolve\r\nthemselves into these two questions:\r\n\r\n  I. In whom are the electoral rights vested? that is to say, who\r\n  are the electors?\r\n\r\n  II. How are these rights exercised? that is to say, what are\r\n  the modes of procedure and the forms of election?\r\n\r\nI wish to bring together in succession under these two questions,\r\nall the facts which relate thereto in the electoral system in\r\nEngland, in the fourteenth century, and to examine what general\r\nprinciples are contained in these facts.\r\n\r\nAnd first, who were the electors? There were two classes of\r\nelectors, in the same manner as there were two kinds of\r\nelections--those for counties and those for boroughs. This\r\nclassification was not the result of a systematic combination nor\r\nof any previous intention: it was the expression of a fact.\r\n\r\nOriginally the knights, and a little later, the freeholders,\r\nalone formed the political nation, and alone possessed political\r\nrights. All enjoyed the same right of assisting at the court or\r\ncouncil of their lord; politically, therefore, they were equal.\r\nWhen the towns had acquired sufficient importance to assist the\r\ncentral power when needful, and strength enough to resist it if\r\noccasion required, then inhabitants became citizens. A new nation\r\ntruly then entered the state. But in entering there, it remained\r\ndistinct from that by which it was preceded. The representatives\r\nof boroughs never deliberated with those of counties. Each of\r\nthese two classes treated with the government of those affairs\r\nwhich interested itself, and consented on its own account to the\r\ntaxes which weighed on itself alone. Originally there was no more\r\ncoalition between the representatives than between the electors:\r\nthe distinction was complete. It cannot be said that there was\r\ninequality, for there was no room for comparison. They were\r\nsimply two different societies represented by their deputies to\r\nthe same government; and the difference of the representation\r\narose from no other principle than the real and primitive\r\ndifference between the two societies.\r\n\r\n{394}\r\n         Right Derived From Capacity.\r\n\r\nNow if each of these societies is considered singly and in\r\nitself, an equality of political rights will be found among the\r\ncitizens called to enjoy them. As, in the counties, all the\r\nfreeholders had the same right to participate in the election,\r\nso, in the towns, every member of the corporation to which a\r\ncharter had been granted shared in the election of their\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\nThus the variety of classes existing in society was reproduced in\r\nthe representation. But, on the one hand, the different classes\r\nwere completely independent of one another: the knights of the\r\nshire did not tax the citizens, nor the citizens the knights of\r\nthe shire; much less did either take part in the other's\r\nelections. On the other hand, the principle of the equality of\r\nright prevailed in each class, among the citizens summoned to\r\nshare in the election.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing, then, that can be deduced from this in favour\r\nof an inequality among men called by virtue of the same principle\r\nto take part in a like action. Such an inequality never existed\r\nin the electoral administration of England in the fourteenth\r\ncentury. The difference that existed was derived from society\r\nitself, and was continued even to the very centre of\r\nrepresentation, which did not present a more uniform whole than\r\nsociety itself. The true, the sole general principle which is\r\nmanifested in the distribution of electoral rights as it then\r\nexisted in England, is this, that right is derived from, and\r\nbelongs to, capacity. This requires some explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n         What Is Electoral Capacity?\r\n\r\nIt is beyond doubt that, at this period, setting aside the chief\r\nbarons whose personal importance was such that it was necessary\r\nto treat with each of them individually, the freeholders, the\r\nclergy, and the burgesses of certain towns, could alone act as\r\ncitizens. Those not comprised in one or other of these classes\r\nwere chiefly poor husbandmen, labouring on subordinate and\r\nprecarious property. They included all men invested with real\r\nindependence, free to dispose of their person and wealth, and in\r\na position to rise to some ideas of social interest. This it is\r\nwhich constitutes political capacity. This capacity varies\r\naccording to time and place; the same degree of fortune and\r\nenlightenment is not everywhere and always sufficient to confer\r\nit, but its elements are constantly the same.\r\n{395}\r\nIt exists wherever we meet with the conditions, whether material\r\nor moral, of that degree of independence and intellectual\r\ndevelopment which enables a man freely and reasonably to\r\naccomplish the political act he is required to perform.\r\nAssuredly, considering the masses, as they should be considered\r\nin such a matter, these conditions are not met with in England in\r\nthe fourteenth century, elsewhere than among the freeholders, the\r\nclergy, and the burgesses of the chief towns. Beyond these\r\nclasses nothing is found but almost servile dependence and brutal\r\nignorance. In summoning these classes, then, to join in the\r\nelection, the electoral system summoned every capable citizen. It\r\nwas derived, therefore, from the principle that capacity confers\r\nright; and among citizens whose capacity was recognized, no\r\ninequality was established.\r\n\r\nThus neither the sovereignty of the majority nor universal\r\nsuffrage, were originally the basis of the British electoral\r\nsystem. Where capacity ceased, limitation of right was\r\nestablished. Within this limit the right was equal in all.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to prove that this is the sole principle on which it\r\nis possible to found a national and true electoral system. Let us\r\nfor the moment forget facts, and consider the question from a\r\npurely philosophical point of view.\r\n\r\nWhat motive has assigned in all times and countries a fixed age\r\nat which a man is declared to have attained his majority, that is\r\nto say, is considered free to manage his own affairs according to\r\nhis own will? This appointment is nothing more than the\r\ndeclaration of the general fact, that, at a certain age, man is\r\ncapable of acting, freely and reasonably, in the sphere of his\r\nindividual interests. Is this declaration arbitrary? No, for if\r\nthe period of his majority were fixed at ten years or at forty,\r\nthe law would evidently be absurd; it would assume the presence\r\nof capacity where it did not exist, or else would not recognize\r\nit where it did exist--that is to say, it would confer or\r\nwithhold the right wrongfully.\r\n\r\nIt is capacity, then, that confers right; and capacity is a fact\r\nindependent of law, which law cannot create or destroy at will,\r\nbut which it ought to endeavour to recognize with precision, that\r\nit may at the same time recognize the right which flows from it.\r\nAnd why does capacity confer right? because in reason, and reason\r\nalone, is right inherent. Capacity is nothing else than the\r\nfaculty of acting in accordance with reason.\r\n\r\n{396}\r\n\r\nWhat is true of the individual considered in relation to his\r\npersonal interests, is true also of the citizen in relation to\r\nsocial interests. Here, also, capacity confers right. Here, also,\r\nright cannot be refused to capacity without injustice. Here,\r\nalso, capacity is a fact which the law, if it be just, asserts\r\nand distinguishes, to attach thereto the right.\r\n\r\nThis is the only principle in virtue of which the limitation of\r\nelectoral rights can be reasonably assigned, and it was this\r\nwhich, without general intention or philosophic views, the nature\r\nof things and good sense caused to prevail in England at the end\r\nof the thirteenth century.\r\n\r\nThis principle equally repels the admission of the incapable,\r\nwhich would give dominion to the majority, that is, to material\r\nforce; and would lead to the exclusion of some portion of the\r\ncapable citizens, which would be an injustice; and to inequality\r\nbetween capacities, of which the least is declared sufficient,\r\nwhich would institute privilege.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Exterior Signs Of Electoral Capacity.\r\n\r\nThis principle once laid down, whether by the enlightened\r\nintention of the legislator, or by the simple force of things, it\r\nbecomes necessary to put it in practice, that is, to seek and\r\nrecognize in society those capacities which confer rights. By\r\nwhat exterior signs, susceptible of determination by law, can\r\nthis capacity be recognized? this is the second enquiry which\r\npresents itself when the question is to fix the limit of\r\nelectoral rights.\r\n\r\nEvidently, we can only proceed here upon assumptions, and those\r\nof a general character. The capacity of acting freely and\r\nreasonably for the promotion of social interests, is revealed by\r\nno more distinct signs than any other internal disposition.\r\nBesides, the law operates on the masses; its decisions will\r\nnecessarily be inexact, and yet must be rigorous. In their\r\napplication to individuals they will often assume capacity where\r\nit is not, and will not in all instances discern it where it is.\r\nThis is the imperfection of human science; the endeavour of the\r\nwise is to restrict this imperfection within its narrowest\r\nlimits.\r\n\r\n{397}\r\n\r\n         Legal Signs Of Electoral Capacity.\r\n\r\nThe electoral system of England was less faulty, in this respect,\r\nat its commencement, than it has since become. It is very\r\nprobable that, in the fourteenth century, all political capacity\r\nwas almost entirely contained in the classes of the freeholders,\r\nthe clergy, and the burgesses of the important towns. This kind\r\nof qualification corresponded, then, very nearly with the true\r\nexternal signs of capacity. It may even be said that if the\r\nrepresentative system had then possessed all its energy, if the\r\nassembly of representatives had had power and importance to\r\nbecome the principal spring of government, and the object of\r\nindividual ambition, it would very soon have been discovered that\r\nthe legal conditions of capacity included a multitude of\r\nindividuals in whom capacity did not truly exist. It was because\r\nmany of those who possessed the right of sharing in elections\r\ntook no part in them that the inconvenience of so much latitude\r\nwas not at first experienced. The principle remained intact\r\nbecause it did not bear all its fruits. When the House of Commons\r\noccupied a higher place in the State, it became necessary to\r\nrestrict the electoral right by requiring the freeholders\r\nthemselves to possess an annual income of forty shillings. The\r\naction of Parliament in the government, and by consequence the\r\nimportance of electoral rights, far surpassed the intelligence\r\nand independence of many of the men to whom ancient custom had\r\naccorded them. Thence arose the limitation established by the\r\nParliament under Henry IV. Since that period, the progress of\r\nsociety and the changes which have occurred in the condition of\r\nproperty and industry, have altered in this respect the\r\nexactness, and therefore the excellence, of the electoral system.\r\nThe legal signs of electoral capacity remain the same as to\r\nright, but, in fact, they have changed. Formerly, the freeholders\r\nwere the only landowners who were truly free and capable of\r\nexercising political rights; the copyholders were then little\r\nbetter than _villani:_ this has long ceased to be the case;\r\nalthough the legal distinction still subsists, it is merely\r\nnominal: copyholds are properties as free, as secured, and as\r\nfully hereditary as freeholds. The title of freeholder is now no\r\nlonger, as formerly, the only one which designates a landowner\r\ncapable of exercising political rights. The law, in its\r\ndescription of the external characters of electoral capacity, no\r\nlonger corresponds really and truly with social facts. This\r\ninconvenience is not very great in practice, because there are\r\nfew copyholders of any importance who do not possess a freehold\r\nof forty shillings rent.\r\n\r\n{398}\r\n\r\nIt is however real, for it maintains a distinction between\r\nproperties as to electoral rights, which is not founded upon any\r\nreal difference between the nature of the properties, and the\r\ncapacity of their possessors. The system has become much more\r\nvicious as regards electoral rights in boroughs. Here the\r\nexternal signs by which the law pretends to recognize capacity,\r\nare become, in many instances, utterly false. The importance of\r\nparticular towns, and the material or intellectual development of\r\ntheir inhabitants, was originally the cause of their investiture\r\nwith electoral rights. The capacity was there; the right\r\nfollowed. Now the principle has disappeared; there are some\r\nboroughs destitute of importance, the inhabitants of which\r\npossess neither wealth nor independence; capacity is no longer\r\nthere, but nevertheless the right continues still. It might be\r\nsupposed that the name of the borough, its site, or its walls,\r\nare the signs of an electoral capacity which ought to reside\r\nthere for ever,--that the privilege appertained to the stones. On\r\nthe other hand there are other towns, which in the fourteenth\r\ncentury would not have failed to obtain their electoral rights,\r\nbecause in effect the capacities of their citizens would have\r\nbeen recognized, that do not yet possess them.\r\n\r\nThus a principle, equitable at first, has ceased to be so,\r\nbecause attempts have been made to arrest the progress of its\r\neffects; or rather the principle itself has perished, and a great\r\npart of the electoral system of England is nothing more than a\r\nviolation of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Vicissitudes Of Electoral Capacity.\r\n\r\nBy this it may be seen that, if the principle which attaches\r\nright to capacity in the matter of election, is universal in its\r\nnature, and susceptible of constant application, the conditions\r\nof this capacity and the external signs by which it is to be\r\nrecognized are essentially variable, and can never be restricted\r\nto the terms of a law without endangering the existence of the\r\nprinciple itself. The vicissitudes of electoral rights, even in\r\nthe earliest time of the existence of Parliament, demonstrate\r\nthis. Political rights belonged at first to the freeholders\r\nalone. Who could reasonably have sought deputies and electors in\r\nthose devastated boroughs, abandoned for the most part by their\r\nancient inhabitants, peopled only by a few poor families, whose\r\ncondition and ideas were not elevated above those of the most\r\nmiserable peasants?\r\n\r\n{399}\r\n\r\n         No Permanent Test Of Electoral Capacity.\r\n\r\nSome towns rose again and became repeopled; commerce brought with\r\nit wealth, and wealth procured social importance, and the\r\ndevelopment of mind. Representatives should emanate from these\r\nbodies; for there were certainly electors. New capacities form\r\nand declare themselves by new symptoms. At the same time, or soon\r\nafter, the number of freeholders increases by the division of\r\nfiefs, many among them fall to a much lower condition than that\r\nof the ancient freeholders, and no longer possess the same\r\nindependence. Will they preserve the same rights when their\r\ncapacity is no longer the same? no, necessity makes each to know\r\nhis value; the mere title of freeholder is no longer a correct\r\nsign of electoral capacity. Another is sought, and the condition\r\nof forty shillings rent enters into the laws. Thus, without any\r\nviolation, and even by the authority of the principle, the\r\nconditions and signs of electoral capacity vary according to the\r\nreal state of society. It is only when this portion of the\r\nelectoral system becomes invariable that the principle will be\r\nviolated.\r\n\r\nIt would then be vain and dangerous to pretend to regulate,\r\nbeforehand and for ever, this part of the electoral system of a\r\nfree people. The determination of the conditions of capacity and\r\nthat of the external characteristics which reveal it, possess, by\r\nthe very nature of things, no universal or permanent character.\r\nAnd not only is it unnecessary to endeavour to fix them, but the\r\nlaws should oppose any unchangeable prescription regarding them.\r\nThe more numerous and flexible the legal characteristics of\r\nelectoral capacity, the less need this danger be dreaded. If, for\r\nexample, the land-tax was regulated and fixed once for all, as it\r\nis to be desired that it may be, this tax alone would be an\r\nincorrect sign of electoral capacity; for it would not follow the\r\nvicissitudes of property: it would enfeoff the land itself with\r\nthe right of election; the rent would be a better indication,\r\nbecause it would be more pliable. If, instead of attributing\r\nelectoral rights by name and for ever to a particular borough,\r\nthe English laws had conferred them upon every town whose\r\npopulation reached a certain limit, or the revenue from which\r\nattained a certain amount, the representation of boroughs,\r\ninstead of becoming corrupt, would have followed the changes and\r\nprogress of true political capacity. We could multiply these\r\nexamples, and prove in a thousand ways that it is better neither\r\nto adopt any one legal sign of electoral capacity, nor to place\r\nthis sign beyond the reach of the vicissitudes of society.\r\n\r\n{400}\r\n\r\n         General Conclusions.\r\n\r\nIn summing up, we may deduce, from our examination of the\r\nelectoral system of England in the fourteenth century, these\r\nthree conclusions:\r\n\r\n  I. The right ought to be coextensive with the capability of\r\n  judicious election, for it is its source.\r\n\r\n  II. The conditions of electoral capacity should vary according\r\n  to time, place, the internal state of society, public\r\n  intelligence, &c.\r\n\r\n  III. The external characteristics prescribed by the laws, as\r\n  declaring the accomplishment of the conditions of electoral\r\n  capacity, should neither be utterly immutable nor derived\r\n  entirely from purely material facts.\r\n\r\n{401}\r\n\r\n              Lecture XVI.\r\n\r\n  Subject of the lecture.\r\n\r\n  Continuation of the philosophical examination of the electoral\r\n  system in England in the fourteenth century.\r\n\r\n  Characteristics of the elections.\r\n\r\n  Examination of the principle of direct or indirect election.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Forms Of Election.\r\n\r\nI now pass to the second of the great questions to which every\r\nelectoral system gives rise. What are the proceedings and forms\r\nof the election? In this question many others are comprised.\r\nThese may be divided into two classes: the one class relating to\r\nthe manner of assembling the electors; the other, to their mode\r\nof operation when assembled.\r\n\r\nThe close union of the electoral system with the exercise of\r\nother rights and political powers, has been productive in England\r\nof extensive and very beneficial consequences with regard to the\r\nmode of collecting the electors together.\r\n\r\nOriginally the election of county representatives required no\r\nspecial and extraordinary convocation of the electors. At\r\nappointed times, they repaired to the county-court to fulfil the\r\nfunctions with which they were charged, and on these occasions\r\nthey elected their representatives. The first writs addressed to\r\nthe sheriffs set forth: _Quod eligi facias in proximo\r\ncomitatu_, \"you will elect in the next county-court.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the importance of the House of Commons had imparted a\r\ncorresponding importance to the election of its members, and the\r\nnecessity of preventing the abuses arising from elections made,\r\nso to speak, by chance, and without any one receiving special\r\nnotice thereof, had become felt, the election was announced\r\nthroughout the country by a proclamation summoning the attendance\r\nof all the electors and indicating the time and place of the\r\nconvocation of Parliament. The election thus became a special and\r\nsolemn act; but was always conducted in the county-court, and at\r\none of its periodic meetings.\r\n\r\n{402}\r\n\r\n         The Object Of Election.\r\n\r\nUltimately, by the lapse of time, the changes of the judicial\r\nsystem, and the development of every institution, the\r\ncounty-courts ceased to retain in England that position which\r\nthey anciently occupied. Their jurisdiction is now rare and very\r\nlimited; the greater part of the freeholders never attend them;\r\nnor are they of any considerable political importance. At the\r\npresent day the sole important object of any assembly of\r\nfreeholders in these courts is the election of representatives,\r\nbut the circumscriptions remain the same: frequent relations\r\nstill exist among the freeholders of the county; the county-court\r\nis still their centre: it is now the electoral college, and that\r\nis its sole important character; but the electoral college is\r\nstill the ancient county-court.\r\n\r\nThe great political result of all these facts is this, that the\r\nelection of representatives has always been, and still is, not\r\nthe work of an assembly of men extraordinarily and arbitrarily\r\nconvened for that purpose, among whom no other tie subsists, and\r\nwho possess no regular and habitual common interests, but the\r\nfruit of ancient relations, of constant and tried influences\r\namong men otherwise united in the transaction and possession of\r\ncommon affairs, functions, rights, and interests. In examining\r\nthe question in itself, we shall very soon become convinced that\r\nthis is the only way to insure veracity in elections, and\r\nsuitableness and authority in the elected representatives.\r\n\r\nThe object of election is evidently to obtain the most capable\r\nand best accredited men in the country. It is a plan for\r\ndiscovering and bringing to light the true, the legitimate\r\naristocracy, which is freely accepted by the masses over whom its\r\npower is to be exercised. To attain this end it is not sufficient\r\nto summon the electors together and to say to them, \"Choose whom\r\nyou will;\" but they should have the opportunity of understanding\r\nthoroughly what they are about, and of concerting together how to\r\ndo it. If they do not know each other, and are equally\r\nunacquainted with the men who solicit their suffrages, the object\r\nis evidently defeated. You will have elections which will result\r\nneither from the free choice nor the actual wishes of the\r\nelectors.\r\n\r\n{403}\r\n\r\n         Convocation Of Electors.\r\n\r\nElection in its nature is a sudden act which does not leave much\r\nroom for deliberation. If this act is not linked with the habits\r\nand previous doings of the electors, if it is not in some sort\r\nthe result of long anterior deliberation, and the expression of\r\ntheir habitual opinion, it will be too easy to take the real wish\r\nof the electors by surprise, or to induce them to listen only to\r\nthe passion of the moment; and the election will thus be\r\ndeficient either in sincerity or in rationality. If, on the\r\ncontrary, the men who have met to elect a representative have\r\nlong been united by common interests; if they are accustomed to\r\nconduct their affairs among themselves; if the election, instead\r\nof taking them out of the habitual sphere in which their lives\r\nare passed, their activity displayed, and their thoughts\r\nexchanged, only assembles them at the centre of that sphere, to\r\nobtain the manifestation, the summary of their opinions, their\r\nwishes and the natural influence which they exercise over each\r\nother; then the election can, and generally will be, both\r\nrational and sincere.\r\n\r\nThe whole of that part of the electoral system which relates to\r\nthe assembling of the electors ought, then, to be founded upon\r\nrespect for natural influences and relations. The election should\r\nassemble the electors together at that centre towards which they\r\nare habitually attracted by their other interests. Well-tried and\r\nfreely accepted influences constitute true and legitimate society\r\namong men. Far from dreading them, in them alone should the real\r\ndesire of society be sought. Every method of uniting electors\r\nwhich annuls or destroys these influences, falsifies the\r\nelections, and makes them run counter to their intended object:\r\nthe less the electoral assembly is extraordinary, the more will\r\nit be adapted to the regular and constant existence of those who\r\ncompose it, and the better will it attain its legitimate end. On\r\nthese terms only can there be electoral colleges that do what\r\nthey wish, and know what they are doing; on these terms only can\r\nthere be representatives who exercise over the electors a solid\r\nand salutary influence.\r\n\r\nThe maintenance of natural influences, and thereby the sincerity\r\nof elections, has not been the only good effect of the primitive\r\nidentity of the electoral assemblies and the county-courts.\r\n\r\n{404}\r\n\r\n              Electoral Districts.\r\n\r\nThese courts being the centre of a multitude of administrative,\r\njudicial, or other interests, presided over by the interested\r\npersons themselves, it was impossible that the boundaries of the\r\ndistrict to which they related could be very extensive; as much\r\ninconvenience would thereby have resulted to the men who\r\nfrequently repaired thither. The division of England into\r\ncounties was not a systematic performance, and it presents some\r\nstriking irregularities. But the force of events prevented most\r\nof the counties from including a very extended territory. This\r\nadvantage is retained in the electoral system. The connections\r\nand ideas of the great majority of citizens do not stretch beyond\r\na certain material sphere: and it is only within the limits of\r\nthis sphere that they are really conversant with affairs, and act\r\nupon their own knowledge. If the election is at too great a\r\ndistance from them, they cease to be enlightened and free agents,\r\nand become tools. Now, since it is of the will and judgment of\r\nthe citizens that the choice is required, it is absurd to\r\nwithhold from them, at the same time, the necessary conditions of\r\nreason and liberty. There is always, then, a limit beyond which\r\nthe extent of an electoral convocation should not be carried, and\r\nthis limit is itself a fact, which results from the manner in\r\nwhich men and interests are grouped together, in the divisions\r\nand subdivisions of the country. It ought to be large enough for\r\nthe election to produce representatives capable of fulfilling\r\ntheir public mission, and contracted enough to insure that the\r\ngreater number of the citizens who take part in the election may\r\nact with discernment and freedom. If the elections were conducted\r\nin England according to hundreds, they would yield, perhaps,\r\nobscure and ignorant representatives; if by episcopal dioceses,\r\nthey would in fact annul a great part of the electoral body. The\r\nmaterial circumstance of the necessity of a distant removal is of\r\nleast consequence. The moral disorder which would result from too\r\nwidely extended boundaries is much more serious.\r\n\r\nFurther; the extension of political rights is no less interested\r\nin this than the excellence of the results of the election. It is\r\ndesirable to enlarge the sphere of these rights, as far as it is\r\nadmitted by the imperious condition of capacity. Now, capacity\r\ndepends upon a multitude of causes.\r\n{405}\r\nA man perfectly capable of prudent choice within a radius of five\r\nmiles from his dwelling, becomes absolutely incapable of doing so\r\nif the radius be extended to twenty miles: in the first case, he\r\nhad the full use of his reason and freedom; in the second, he\r\nloses it. If, then, you would judiciously multiply the number of\r\nthe electors, do not place the electoral centre too far from the\r\npoints of circumference from whence some will have to repair\r\nthither. In all this we must proceed to some extent upon\r\nsupposition, and general results alone are sought; but the\r\nprinciple is invariably the same. The election must be made by\r\nelectors capable of choosing wisely, and must supply in those who\r\nare elected, men capable of thoroughly comprehending the\r\ninterests upon which they will have to administrate. These are\r\nthe two requirements, between which the limits of electoral\r\nboundaries should be sought, subject always to the condition of\r\nnever determining these boundaries in an arbitrary way, so as to\r\nbreak through the habits, and destroy the natural and permanent\r\nstate of society. Generally speaking, the division into counties\r\nformerly attained this twofold object in England.\r\n\r\nThe boundaries being defined, in accordance with the natural\r\ngrouping of the citizens, and the electors being assembled, what\r\nis required of them?\r\n\r\n\r\n         Number Of Representatives.\r\n\r\nCustom, and no standard derived from population, wealth, or any\r\nother cause, has ordained in England, that two members only\r\nshould be returned from each district, with the exception of a\r\nvery few places. This custom probably derives its origin from the\r\nimpossibility which formerly existed of finding in the boroughs,\r\nand even in the counties, a greater number of men able and\r\nwilling to undertake a mission then very little sought after. It\r\nhas been seen that on several occasions three or four knights\r\nwere required from the county-courts. The number was very soon\r\nreduced to two, and this fact has become the general law.\r\nWhatever may be its historic principle, this fact contains a\r\nrational principle, viz., that the election is neither sound nor\r\ngood, except when the number required to be elected is very\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\n{406}\r\n\r\n         Action Of Party Influence.\r\n\r\nNo one has ever denied that the fundamental law of all election\r\nis this, that the electors should do what they desire, and\r\nunderstand what they are doing. In practice, however, this is\r\noften forgotten. It is forgotten when electors, meeting together\r\nbut for a short space of time, are required to make choice of\r\nmore than one or two. The great merit of election is, that it\r\nshould proceed from the elector, that on his part it is a true\r\nchoice, an act both of judgment and will. Beyond doubt, no\r\nextraneous will or judgment may in any case be rightfully imposed\r\nupon him; though he may always accept or reject that which is\r\nproposed to him: but this is not sufficient; the elector must be\r\nplaced in such a position that his personal judgment, his own\r\nwill, shall be not only free, but stimulated to display\r\nthemselves in their actual character. Their exercise must be not\r\nonly possible, but must not be too difficult. Now, this error is\r\nfallen into when, instead of one or two names, a whole list of\r\nnames is demanded. The elector, almost always incapable of\r\ncompleting this list of himself and by the help of his own\r\ndiscernment, falls under the dominion of combinations which he\r\nsuffers rather than accepts; for he does not possess the\r\nknowledge necessary for judging correctly of their whole aim and\r\neffect. Who does not know that almost every elector in such a\r\ncase cannot include in his list more than one or two names that\r\nare truly known to him, and which he really desires? The choice\r\nof the remainder is made for him, and he writes them in\r\nconfidence or out of complaisance. And who makes this choice? The\r\nparty to which the elector belongs. Now, party influence, like\r\nevery other influence, is good only so far as it is exercised\r\nupon those who can form a just opinion of it, and not submit to\r\nit blindly. The despotism of party spirit is no better than any\r\nother despotism, and all good legislation should tend to preserve\r\ncitizens from its sway. Into elections, as into every other act,\r\nlevity, inconsiderateness, or passion may enter: but to these\r\ndispositions the law is not bound to show respect and afford\r\nfacility. It should, on the contrary, strive to prevent their\r\nhaving any effect; and by the process of the election itself, it\r\nshould, as far as possible, secure to the citizen the exercise of\r\nhis judgment as well as the independence of his will. It is not\r\nrequisite to repel all influences, or to declare them\r\nillegitimate beforehand. Every election is the result of\r\ninfluences, and it would be folly to pretend to isolate the\r\nelector under the pretext of obtaining his unbiassed opinion and\r\ndesire.\r\n{407}\r\nThis would be to forget that man is a reasonable and free being;\r\nand that reason is called to debate, and liberty to choose. The\r\nsoundness of election arises precisely from the conflict of\r\ninfluences. The law must allow them to reach the elector, and\r\ngrant them all natural means of acting upon his judgment; but it\r\nought not to deliver him up to them defenceless. It should take\r\ncertain precautions against human weakness, and the most\r\nefficacious of these precautions will be, to require nothing of\r\nthe elector that he cannot perform with true spontaneity of\r\naction. The citizen being thus left to himself, all influences\r\nmay act upon him: they may perhaps induce him to abandon the name\r\nthat he loved for one with which he was previously unacquainted;\r\nbut they will need at least to exert greater efforts to conquer\r\nhis reason or to subdue his will. Now, it is right that they\r\nshould be condemned to make such efforts, and that they should\r\nnot be able to obtain from levity, precipitation, or ignorance\r\nalone, an assent, the effect of which is to give to the whole\r\ncountry an exponent whom the elector himself would not have\r\ndesired had he been able, in nominating him, to make a full use\r\nof his reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Evils Of Hasty Elections.\r\n\r\nWhen we investigate the causes which have introduced into certain\r\ncountries, in the matter of election, a custom so opposed to the\r\ntrue interests of liberty, and which is never met with where\r\nliberty has really been introduced into the practice of political\r\nlife, we perceive that it is derived, in part at least, from the\r\nevil principle on which the whole electoral system has been\r\nfounded. Electoral rights have been isolated from other rights,\r\nand separately constituted; electoral assemblies have been in no\r\nway connected with other public affairs, with local\r\nadministration, or with common and permanent interests. They have\r\nbeen made extraordinary and solemn assemblies of very brief\r\nduration. The electoral boundaries have in general been too\r\nwidely extended: hence has arisen the necessity of suddenly\r\nassembling together the whole body of electors, of dismissing\r\nthem almost immediately, and at the same time, of requiring from\r\nthem the choice of too many representatives. In England, the poll\r\nremains open at least fifteen days for the election of one or two\r\nmembers. Every one gives his vote when it bests suits him. In\r\nAmerica, the other forms are yet more mild and free.\r\n{408}\r\nIn the system which has prevailed with us, on the contrary, all\r\nis sudden and precipitate: everything is done _en masse_,\r\nand by masses of people whose reason and liberty are in a great\r\nmeasure disabled from acting, by the haste and extent of the\r\noperation. Hence also is derived the scheme of the ballot, and of\r\nan absolute majority, consequences inevitably flowing from a\r\nrapid and numerous election; whilst elsewhere, the system of a\r\nrelative and long-contested plurality affords public opinion\r\nleisure to select, and freedom to manifest its choice. And hence,\r\nfinally, arises the necessity of an elected bureau, which\r\nentrusts beforehand to the majority the inspection of all the\r\nelectoral operations, thus casting suspicion upon the\r\nauthenticity of the results. When liberty is everywhere to be\r\nfound, when all rights are bound together and mutually sustained,\r\nwhen publicity is real and universally present, there will always\r\nbe independent magistrates to whom the direction and\r\nsuperintendence of elections may be confided; and there is then\r\nno necessity for placing them under the influence of party\r\nspirit, in order to withdraw them from the always-suspected\r\ninfluence of superior authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Advantages Of Direct Election.\r\n\r\nThese details relate to the forms of electoral operations; but as\r\ntheir vices flow from the general principles which regulate them,\r\nit was necessary to point out this connection.\r\n\r\nDirect election has been the constant practice of England; and\r\nAmerica has adopted the same system. It has been otherwise in\r\nmost of the European States in which representative government\r\nhas been established in our own times. This is one of the most\r\nimportant facts presented to our view by the British electoral\r\nsystem. In this system, direct election has been the natural\r\nconsequence of the idea that was then entertained regarding\r\npolitical rights. Not only were these rights unshared by all, but\r\nthey were not even distributed systematically, or upon one\r\ngeneral plan. They were recognized wherever the capacity of\r\nexercising them was actually to be met with. The importance of\r\nfreeholders and citizens had entailed upon them the right of\r\ninterference in public affairs. This intervention was their right\r\nwhen these affairs related to themselves. Being unable to\r\nexercise this right personally, they elected representatives.\r\n{409}\r\nIn the spirit of the time, this right of election corresponded\r\nexactly to the right that the powerful barons exercised of being\r\nrepresented in Parliament by delegated agents. The individual\r\nimportance of a powerful baron being very great, his proxy was\r\nindividual. The freeholders and citizens also possessed an\r\nindividual right, but not the same importance, and they therefore\r\nhad one proxy to represent many of them. But, fundamentally, the\r\nrepresentation was founded on the same principle--the individual\r\nrights of the electors to debate on and consent to such matters\r\nas interested them.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Its Relation To Representative Government.\r\n\r\nIn this point of view, it is easy of comprehension that direct\r\nelection prevailed, and that no other idea presented itself to\r\nthe public mind. All indirect election, every new medium placed\r\nbetween Parliament and the elector, would have appeared, and\r\nwould in fact have been, a diminution of the right, a weakening\r\nof the importance and political intervention of the electors.\r\n\r\nDirect election, then, is the simple idea, the primitive and\r\nnatural electoral system of representative government, when\r\nrepresentative government is itself the spontaneous produce of\r\nits true principle,--that is to say, when political rights are\r\nderived from capacity.\r\n\r\nIn considering this mode of election under a purely philosophical\r\npoint of view, and as it respects not merely the electors alone,\r\nbut society in general, does it remain equally preferable to\r\nevery other more artificial combination?\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to examine it first in its relation to the\r\nrational principle of representative government; and, in the\r\nsecond place, in its practical results.\r\n\r\nWe have in a previous lecture laid down the rational principle of\r\nrepresentative government. In right, this principle asserts, that\r\ntrue sovereignty is that of justice; and that no law is\r\nlegitimate if it is not conformable to justice and to truth, that\r\nis to say, to the divine law. In fact, this principle recognizes,\r\nthat no man or assembly of men, in a word, no terrestrial force,\r\nis fully conscious and constantly desirous of reason, justice,\r\nand truth--the true law. Connecting this right and fact together,\r\nthe inference is, that the public powers which actually exercise\r\nsovereignty ought to be constantly required and constrained on\r\nevery occasion to seek after the true law, the sole source of\r\nlegitimate authority.\r\n\r\n{410}\r\n\r\n         Qualifications Of Representatives.\r\n\r\nThe object of the representative system, in its general elements\r\nas well as in all the details of its organization, is, then, to\r\ncollect and concentrate all the scattered elements of reason\r\nwhich exist in society, and to apply it to its government.\r\n\r\nFrom thence it necessarily follows that representatives ought to\r\nbe the men most capable:\r\n\r\n  1. To discover, by means of their united deliberation, the law\r\n  of reason, the truth which, on all occasions, the least as well\r\n  as the greatest, exists, and ought to be the ground of\r\n  decision; and\r\n\r\n  2. To enforce the recognition and observance, by the citizens\r\n  in general, of this law when once discovered and expressed.\r\n\r\nIn order to discover and secure the men most capable of\r\nfulfilling this mission, that is to say, good representatives, it\r\nis necessary to compel those who think or profess themselves to\r\nbe such, to prove their capacity, and to obtain its recognition\r\nand assertion from the men who, in their turn, are capable of\r\nforming a judgment upon it, that is to say, upon the individual\r\ncapacity of any man who aspires to become a representative. Thus\r\ndoes legitimate power evidence itself, and it is thus that, in\r\nthe fact of election, philosophically considered, this power is\r\nexercised by those who possess it, and accepted by those who\r\nrecognize it.\r\n\r\nNow, there is a certain relation, a certain tie, between the\r\ncapacity of being [a good representative or otherwise], and the\r\ncapacity of recognizing the man who possesses the capacity of\r\nbeing. This is a fact which is continually illustrated in the\r\nworld. The brave man excites those to follow him who can\r\nassociate themselves with his bravery. The skilful man obtains\r\nobedience from those who are capable of comprehending his skill.\r\nThe wise man engages the belief of those who are capable of\r\nappreciating his knowledge. Every superiority, has a certain\r\nsphere of attraction in which it acts, and gathers around itself\r\nreal inferiorities, which are, however, in a condition to feel\r\nand to accept its action.\r\n\r\nThis sphere is by no means boundless. This also is a simple,\r\nself-evident fact. The relation which connects a superiority with\r\nthe inferiorities by which it is recognized, being a purely\r\nintellectual relation, cannot exist where there does not also\r\nexist a sufficient degree of knowledge and intelligence to form\r\nthe connection.\r\n{411}\r\nA man, though very fit to recognize the superiority capable of\r\ndeliberating on the affairs of his commune, may be quite unfit to\r\ndistinguish and point out by his vote a person who shall be\r\ncapable of deliberating on the affairs of the State. There are,\r\nthen, some inferiorities, destitute of all true relation with\r\ncertain superiorities, and which, if they were called upon to\r\ndistinguish between them, would be either unable to do so, or\r\nwould arrive at a most incorrect conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe limit at which the faculty ceases of recognizing and\r\naccepting the superiority which constitutes the capacity of being\r\na good deputy, is that at which the right of election ought to\r\ncease; for it is here that the capacity ceases of being a good\r\nelector.\r\n\r\nAbove this limit, the right of election exists only because of\r\nthe actual existence of the capacity of recognizing the superior\r\ncapacity that is sought. Below it, there is no right.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Philosophic Necessity Of Direct Election.\r\n\r\nFrom thence, the necessity of direct election philosophically\r\nresults. Evidently it is desired to obtain that which is sought.\r\nNow, that which is sought, is a good representative. Superior\r\ncapacity, that of the representative, is necessarily, therefore,\r\nthe dominant condition, the starting-point of the whole\r\noperation. You will obtain this superior capacity by requiring\r\nits recognition by all those capacities which, although inferior,\r\nstand in natural relation with it. If, on the contrary, you begin\r\nby electing the electors, what will be the result? you have to\r\naccomplish an operation analogous to the preceding, but the point\r\nof departure is altered, and the general condition is lowered.\r\nYou take as your foundation the capacity of the elector, that is\r\nto say, a capacity inferior to that which you wish definitively\r\nto obtain; and you necessarily address yourself to capacities\r\nstill more inferior and quite unfit to conduct you, even under\r\nthis form, to the more elevated result at which you aim; for the\r\ncapacity of the elector being only the ability to select a good\r\nrepresentative, it would be necessary to be in a position to\r\ncomprehend the latter condition in order to comprehend the\r\nformer, which can never happen.\r\n\r\n{412}\r\n\r\n         Evils Of Indirect Election.\r\n\r\nIndirect election, therefore, considered in itself, derogates\r\nfrom the primitive principle as well as from the ultimate object\r\nof representative government, and debases its nature. Considered\r\nin its practical results, in facts, and independently of every\r\ngeneral principle, this system appears equally unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we regard it as admitted, that it is\r\ndesirable that the election of representatives should not be in\r\ngeneral the work of a very small number of electors. When\r\nelectoral assemblies are very limited, not only is the election\r\ndeficient in that action and energy which sustain political life\r\nin society, and afterwards contribute in great measure to the\r\npower of the representative himself, but general interests,\r\nexpansive ideas, and public opinions cease to be the motive and\r\nregulating power. Coteries form themselves,--in the place of\r\npolitical parties, personal intrigues spring up; and a struggle\r\nis established between interests, opinions, and relations, which\r\nare almost individual in their nature. The election is no less\r\ndisputed, but it is less national, and its results possess the\r\nsame fault.\r\n\r\nStarting, then, from this point, that electoral assemblies ought\r\nto be sufficiently numerous to prevent individualities from\r\nobtaining such easy dominion, I seek to discover how, by indirect\r\nelection, this end can reasonably be attained.\r\n\r\nTwo hypotheses alone are possible: either the territorial\r\nboundaries, within which the assembly will be formed, charged\r\nwith the nomination of the electors, will be very narrow, or will\r\nbe of considerable extent. In England, for example, the electors\r\nwould be required from the tithings or the hundreds, which\r\ncorrespond very nearly to our _communes_ and _cantons_.\r\nIf these boundaries are very narrow, and only a very small number\r\nare required to be selected from each--two electors for\r\nexample--very probably some of these electors will be of a very\r\ninferior order.\r\n\r\nTrue electoral capacities are by no means equally divided among\r\ncommunes; one commune may possess twenty or thirty, while another\r\ncontains only a few, or perhaps none at all; and this is the case\r\nwith the majority. If each district is required to furnish the\r\nsame, or nearly the same number of electors, great violence will\r\nbe done to realities. Many of the incapable will be summoned;\r\nmany who are capable will be excluded; and, finally, an electoral\r\nassembly will be constituted, but little adapted for the wise\r\nchoice of representatives.\r\n{413}\r\nIf, on the contrary, each district is required to designate a\r\nnumber of electors proportioned to its importance, its\r\npopulation, and the wealth and intelligence that are concentrated\r\nin it, then, wherever the number to be chosen is considerable,\r\nthere will no longer be any true choice.\r\n\r\nIt has already been shown, that elections, when they are numerous\r\nand simultaneous, lose their character. There will be lists of\r\nelectors prepared by the external influence either of parties or\r\nof power, which will be adopted or rejected without discernment\r\nor freedom. In this respect experience has everywhere confirmed\r\nthe previsions of reason.\r\n\r\nIf the districts summoned to name the electors possess any great\r\nextent, another alternative presents itself. Either each will be\r\nrequired to choose only a small number, and then the object will\r\nbe defeated, for the assembly whose duty it will be to elect the\r\nrepresentatives will be very innumerous: or a large number of\r\nelectors will be required from each district, and then the\r\ninconvenience which has been already pointed out will be\r\nincurred.\r\n\r\nLet all the possible combinations of indirect election be\r\nexhausted, and there will not be found one which can finally\r\nsupply, for the election of representatives, an assembly\r\nsufficiently numerous, and formed at the same time with\r\ndiscernment and liberty. In this system these two results\r\nmutually exclude each other.\r\n\r\nI proceed now to another vicious practice connected with this\r\nsystem, which is no less serious, than those just indicated.\r\n\r\nThe end of representative government is to bring publicly into\r\nproximity and contact the chief interests and various opinions\r\nwhich divide society, and dispute for supremacy, in the just\r\nconfidence that from their debates will result the recognition\r\nand adoption of the laws and measures which are most suitable for\r\nthe country in general. This end is only attained by the triumph\r\nof the true majority--the minority being constantly listened to\r\nwith respect.\r\n\r\nIf the majority is displaced by artifice, there is falsity. If\r\nthe minority is removed from the struggle beforehand, there is\r\noppression. In either case representative government is\r\ncorrupted.\r\n\r\n{414}\r\n\r\nAll the constituent laws of this form of government have, then,\r\ntwo fundamental conditions to fulfil: first, to secure the\r\nmanifestation and triumph of the true majority; and, secondly, to\r\ninsure the intervention and unshackled endeavour of the minority.\r\n\r\nThese two conditions are as essential to the laws which regulate\r\nthe mode of the election of representatives, as to those which\r\npreside over the debates of deliberative assemblies. In neither\r\ncase ought there to be falsehood or tyranny.\r\n\r\nAn electoral system which would annul beforehand,--with regard\r\nto the final result of the elections, that is to say, with regard\r\nto the formation of the deliberative assembly,--the influence\r\nand participation of the minority, would destroy representative\r\ngovernment, and would be as fatal to the majority itself as any\r\nlaw which, in the deliberative assembly, should condemn the\r\nminority to silence.\r\n\r\nThis, to a certain extent, is the result of indirect election,\r\n\r\nBy direct election, and supposing that the limit of electoral\r\ncapacity has been reasonably fixed by law, that is to say, at the\r\npoint at which true capacity actually ceases, all the citizens\r\nwhose social position, fortune, or intelligence place them above\r\nthis limit, are equally summoned to unite in the choice of\r\nrepresentatives. No inquiry is made of them concerning the\r\nopinions or interests which they advocate. The result of the\r\nelection will make known the true majority; but whatever that may\r\nbe they will have no cause to complain: the trial will have been\r\ncomplete, and they will have taken their rightful part in it.\r\n\r\nIndirect election, on the contrary, effects beforehand a thorough\r\npurgation of the electoral capacities, and eliminates a certain\r\nnumber, solely on account of the opinions or interests which they\r\nmay hold. It intrudes into the sphere of these capacities in\r\norder to exclude a part of the minority, so as to give to the\r\nmajority a factitious force, and thus to destroy the true\r\nexpression of the general opinion. We should exclaim loudly\r\nagainst a law which should say, _à priori_: \"All the men, or\r\nonly the third or fourth part of the men, attached to such an\r\ninterest or such an opinion, shall be excluded from all\r\nparticipation in the election of representatives, whatever may\r\notherwise be their importance and social position.\"\r\n\r\n{415}\r\n\r\n         Source Of Indirect Election.\r\n\r\nThis is precisely what is done, _à posteriori_, by indirect\r\nelection; and thereby it introduces into representative\r\ngovernment positive disorder, for it creates a means of tyranny\r\nfor the benefit of the majority. It may even happen, and examples\r\nof this are not wanting, that indirect election, when thus\r\nemployed to eliminate a portion of the natural electoral\r\ncapacities, may result in turning against the majority itself,\r\nand putting it in the minority. A supposition will clearly\r\nexplain this idea. If, in the fourteenth century, it had been\r\ndecreed in England, that \"the copyholders and villeins should\r\nunite in nominating the electors of the members of Parliament,\"\r\nis it not evident that their choice would have fallen on the\r\nlords whose lands they rented or cultivated by any particular\r\ntitle; and that the inhabitants of the towns, the citizens, would\r\nhave been almost absolutely excluded from the House of Commons?\r\nThus, this part of the nation, which had already attained so much\r\nimportance, would have seen themselves deprived of the exercise\r\nof political rights by a system which urged, as its sole specious\r\npretext, the extension of these rights to a greater number of\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nThis is, in fact, the true source of indirect election; it is\r\nderived from the sovereignty of numbers, and from universal\r\nsuffrage: and as it is impossible to reduce these two principles\r\nto practice, it is attempted to retain some shadow of their\r\nexistence. The principle of representative government is\r\nviolated, its nature debased, and the right of election weakened,\r\nin order that consistent adherence to an erroneous doctrine may,\r\nto all appearance, be maintained. Who can fail to see that such a\r\nsystem must necessarily enervate election, and that reality and\r\nenergy can be preserved by the system of direct election alone?\r\nEvery action, the result of which is distant and uncertain,\r\ninspires little interest; and the same men who will unitedly\r\ndisplay great discernment and animation in the choice of their\r\nmunicipal officers, would give their suffrage blindly and coldly\r\nto subsequent electors whom their thoughts never follow into the\r\nfuture in which they interfere so little. This pretended homage\r\nto wills not sufficiently enlightened to be trusted with a\r\ngreater share of influence in the choice of representatives, is\r\nat the bottom nothing but miserable quackery and lying adulation;\r\nand under a simulated extension of political rights there is\r\nconcealed the restriction, mutilation, and enfeebling of these\r\nrights in the sphere in which they really exist, and in which\r\nthey might be exercised in all their fulness and with complete\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n{416}\r\n\r\nThe true way to diffuse political life in all directions, and to\r\ninterest as great a number of citizens as possible in the\r\nconcerns of the State, is not to make them all combine in the\r\nsame acts, although they may not all be equally capable of\r\nperforming them; but to confer upon them all those rights which\r\nthey are capable of exercising. Rights are worth nothing unless\r\nthey are full, direct, and efficacious. In place of perverting\r\npolitical rights by weakening them, under the pretext of giving\r\nthem diffusion, let local liberties everywhere exist, guaranteed\r\nby real rights. The electoral system itself will thus become much\r\nmore powerful than it could possibly be under a pretended system\r\nof universal suffrage.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Practice Of Open Voting.\r\n\r\nThe last important fact to be noticed in the electoral system of\r\nEngland in the fourteenth century, is open voting. Some have\r\nattempted to regard this as an absolute principle capable of\r\nconstant application; but we think it ought not so to be\r\nconsidered. The only absolute principle in this matter is, that\r\nelection should be free, and should truly display the true\r\nthoughts and real wishes of the electors. If open voting puts a\r\nserious restraint on liberty of elections and perverts their\r\nresults, it ought to be abolished. Doubtless such a condition\r\nargues infirmity of liberty and timidity of morals, and proves\r\nthat a portion of society is in conflict with influences which it\r\nis afraid to shake off, though it ardently desires to be rid of\r\nthem. This is a melancholy fact, but it is one which liberty,\r\nrendered fruitful by time, can alone destroy. It is very true\r\nthat open voting in elections, as well as in the debates of\r\ndeliberative assemblies, is the natural consequence of\r\nrepresentative government. It is quite true that there is a\r\ndegree of shame attached to liberty if it claim secrecy for\r\nitself' while imposing publicity on power. That liberty which can\r\nonly attack is still very feeble; for the true power of freedom\r\nconsists in its bold defence and avowal of its rights.\r\n{417}\r\nCertainly there is an ill grace in the complaints of the\r\nniggardliness and delay with which power grants rights, when\r\nconcealment is necessary for the exercise of rights already\r\npossessed. But when reason is applied to practice, it regards,\r\nfor some time at least, nothing besides facts; and the most\r\nimperious of all principles is necessity. To impose open voting\r\nwhen it would injure freedom of election would be to compromise\r\ngeneral liberty itself, which, ere long, must necessarily\r\nestablish open voting.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Electoral System Of England.\r\n\r\nTo sum up what I have said. Nearly all the fundamental principles\r\nof a free and reasonable electoral system may be discovered in\r\nthe electoral system of England in the fourteenth century.\r\nBestowal of electoral rights upon capacity; close union of\r\nelectoral rights with all other rights; regard to natural\r\ninfluences and relations; absence of all arbitrary and factitious\r\ncombinations in the formation and proceedings of electoral\r\nassemblies; prudent limitation in the number to be chosen by each\r\nassembly; direct election, and open voting; all are to be met\r\nwith. These are entirely due to the decisive circumstance that\r\nthe electoral system and representative government itself were in\r\nEngland the simple and natural result of facts, the consequence\r\nand development of real and powerful anterior liberties, which\r\nserved as their basis, and guarded and nourished in their bosom\r\nthe roots of the tree which is indebted to them for its growth.\r\n\r\nBy another equally decisive circumstance, this system, though so\r\nnational and spontaneous in its origin, became corrupted, at\r\nleast in part, and appears at the present day to require\r\ncorrection. Perhaps it is owing to its very power that it remains\r\ninflexible: it has only followed at a distance the vicissitudes\r\nand progress of social conditions. It now protects the remnants\r\nof those abuses against which, at first, and for a long time, it\r\nwas directed; and yet the reform of these abuses, by whatever\r\nmeans and at whatever period it may be effected, will be the\r\nfruit of the institutions, habits, principles, and sentiments\r\nwhich this system has established.\r\n\r\n{418}\r\n\r\n              Lecture XVII.\r\n\r\n  Origin of the division of the English Parliament into two\r\n  Houses.\r\n\r\n  Its original constitution.\r\n\r\n  Reproduction of the classifications of society in the\r\n  Parliament.\r\n\r\n  Causes which led the representatives of counties to separate\r\n  from the barons, and coalesce with the representatives of\r\n  boroughs.\r\n\r\n  Effects of this coalition.\r\n\r\n  Division of the Parliament into two Houses in the fourteenth\r\n  century.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Division Of The English Parliament.\r\n\r\nOur attention has hitherto been directed only to the elements of\r\nwhich the Parliament was composed, and to the proceedings that\r\ntook place at its formation, that is to say, to the process of\r\nelection: we have now to consider another question; we must\r\nenquire what were the internal and external constitution and\r\norganisation of the Parliament thus composed.\r\n\r\nThe Parliament at the beginning of the fourteenth century was not\r\ndivided, as at present, into the House of Lords and the House of\r\nCommons; nor did it, on the other hand, consist of a single body.\r\nAccounts vary regarding the date at which it assumed its present\r\nform. Carte fixes it in the seventeenth year of the reign of\r\nEdward III. (1344); the authors of the Parliamentary History, in\r\nthe sixth year of the same reign (1333); Mr. Hallam in the first\r\nyear of the reign of Edward III. (1327), or, perhaps, even in the\r\neighth year of the reign of Edward II. (1315).\r\n\r\nThe principal cause of this diversity of opinion is the different\r\ncircumstance with which each author connects the fact of the\r\nunion of county and borough members into one single assembly.\r\nThis fact is deduced by some from the date of their assembling\r\ntogether in the same place; by others, from the period of their\r\ncommon deliberation; and by others again, from the union of their\r\nvotes upon the same question. And as each of these circumstances\r\noccurred in one particular Parliament independently of the\r\nothers, the period when Parliament first existed in its present\r\nform is carried back or forward according to the circumstance\r\nwhich is regarded as decisive in this respect.\r\n{419}\r\nHowever this may be, it may be affirmed that the division of\r\nParliament into two Houses,--one comprising the lords or great\r\nbarons individually summoned, and the other all the elected\r\nrepresentatives of counties and boroughs; and both these houses\r\ndeliberating and voting together in all matters of business--was\r\nnot completely and definitively effected, until towards the\r\nmiddle of the fourteenth century. It is necessary to trace the\r\nsteps by which this fact was gradually accomplished. This is the\r\nonly way thoroughly to comprehend its nature and its causes.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Original Constitution Of Parliament.\r\n\r\nOriginally, as we have seen, all the immediate vassals of the\r\nking had the same right of repairing to Parliament and taking\r\npart in its deliberations. Mere knights, therefore, when they\r\nrepaired thither, sat, deliberated, and voted, with the great\r\nbarons.\r\n\r\nWhen election was substituted for this individual right in the\r\ncase of the knights of shires, and only those elected by the\r\ncounty-courts were entitled to attend the Parliament, they still\r\ncontinued to be members of the class to which they had previously\r\nbelonged. Although elected and deputed not only by those knights\r\nwho were immediate vassals of the king, but also by all the\r\nfreeholders of their county, they continued to sit, deliberate,\r\nand vote, together with the great barons who were individually\r\nsummoned.\r\n\r\nThe representatives of the boroughs, on the contrary, whose\r\npresence in Parliament was a novel circumstance (which was not\r\nconnected with any anterior right exercised merely under a new\r\nshape), formed a distinct assembly from their first appearance in\r\nParliament, sitting apart, deliberating and voting on their own\r\naccount, and as thoroughly separated from the knights of the\r\nshire as from the great barons.\r\n\r\n{420}\r\n\r\n         Separate Votes Of Various Classes.\r\n\r\nThis separation is evident from the votes of Parliament at this\r\nperiod. At the Parliament held at Westminster under Edward I., in\r\n1295, the earls, barons, and knights of the shire granted the\r\nking an eleventh part of their personal property, the clergy a\r\ntenth part, and the citizens and burgesses a seventh. In 1296,\r\nthe former granted a twelfth part, and the latter an eighth. In\r\n1305, the former gave a thirtieth part, and the clergy, the\r\ncitizens, and burgesses a twentieth. Under Edward II., in 1308,\r\nthe barons and knights granted one twentieth, the clergy a\r\nfifteenth, the citizens and burgesses a fifteenth. Under Edward\r\nIII., in 1333, the knights of the shire granted a fifteenth, the\r\nsame as the prelates and the nobles, and the citizens and\r\nburgesses a tenth; and yet the records of this Parliament\r\nexpressly declare that the knights of the shire and the burgesses\r\ndeliberated in common. In 1341, the prelates, earls, and barons,\r\non the one hand, and the knights of the shire on the other,\r\ngranted a ninth of their sheep, lambs, and fleeces; and the\r\nburgesses, a ninth of all their personal property. In 1345, the\r\nknights of the shire granted two-fifteenths, the burgesses a\r\nfifth: the lords granted nothing, but promised to follow the king\r\nin person. Thus, at this latter period, the knights of the shire\r\nno longer voted in common with the lords, but they still voted\r\napart from the burgesses.\r\n\r\nIn 1347, the commons without distinction granted two fifteenths,\r\nto be levied in two years in the cities, the boroughs, the\r\nancient domains of the crown, and the counties. At this period,\r\nthen, the fusion of the two elements of the Commons House was\r\ncomplete: and it continued so ever afterwards, although a few\r\nexamples are still found of special taxes, voted by the\r\nrepresentatives of the towns and boroughs alone in the case of\r\ncustoms, especially in 1373.\r\n\r\nThe original separation, then, was between the representatives of\r\nthe counties and those of the boroughs. The recollections of\r\nfeudal law allied the former to the great barons during more that\r\n[than?] fifty years. This separation was not confined solely to\r\nvoting the supplies. Everything indicates, although it is nowhere\r\nproved by written evidence, that the knights of the shire and the\r\nrepresentatives of the boroughs did not deliberate together any\r\nmore on other affairs, either legislative or otherwise, which\r\ninterested only one of the two classes. When mercantile interests\r\nwere in question, the king and his council discussed them solely\r\nwith the representatives of the towns and boroughs. Thus, there\r\nis reason to believe that the statute entitled _The Statute of\r\nActon-Burnel_, passed in 1283, was enacted in this manner on\r\nthe advice of the borough representatives alone, who met for this\r\npurpose at Acton-Burnel, whilst the knights of the shire sat with\r\nthe great barons at Shrewsbury, to assist at the trial of David,\r\nPrince of Wales, then a prisoner. The separation of the two\r\nclasses of representatives could therefore be carried thus far,\r\nthat each class may have sat in different, though neighbouring\r\ntowns.\r\n\r\n{421}\r\n\r\n         Causes Of This Separation.\r\n\r\nWhen they sat in the same town, and especially at Westminster,\r\nthe whole Parliament met together, most probably in the same\r\nchamber; but the great barons and knights of the shire occupied\r\nthe upper end, and the borough representatives the lower part, of\r\nthe chamber.\r\n\r\nA distinction existed even among the borough members. Until the\r\nreign of Edward III., the representatives of those boroughs which\r\nformed part of the ancient domain of the crown constituted a\r\nseparate class, and voted distinct supplies.\r\n\r\nThe division of Parliament, then, far from having originated in\r\nthe forms which prevailed fifty years later, arose from\r\nprinciples altogether different. No idea then existed of truly\r\ngeneral interests and a national representation. The particular\r\ninterests which were of sufficient importance to take part in the\r\ngovernment, intervened in it solely on their own account, and\r\ntreated separately of their own affairs. Did the matter in hand\r\nrelate exclusively to things in which the great barons appeared\r\nto be interested, and where the king required their assistance\r\nalone--they alone assembled and deliberated. Was the question one\r\nof modifications in the nature or mode of the transmission of\r\nfeudal territorial property--the knights of the shire were\r\nsummoned; and in this way the statute _Quia emptores_ was\r\nenacted under Edward I. Were commercial interests concerned--the\r\nking treated of them with the borough representatives only. In\r\nthese various cases, as in the matter of supplies, the\r\ndeliberation and vote of the different classes of members of\r\nParliament were distinct. These classes were formed in reference\r\nto their common interests, and took no part in each other's\r\naffairs: and very rarely, probably never, at this period, was\r\nthere any matter of sufficiently general and common importance to\r\nall, for all to have been summoned to deliberate and vote in\r\ncommon.\r\n\r\n{422}\r\n         Formation Of The Commons.\r\n\r\nThus the classification of society was perpetuated in the\r\nParliament, and was the true principle of the division between\r\nthe members of Parliament.\r\n\r\nThis state of things did not long continue, because the\r\nclassification of society itself, in which it originated, also\r\ntended to its own effacement. The county members could not fail\r\nto separate themselves altogether from the great barons, and\r\ncompletely to combine with the borough representatives; and for\r\nthe following reasons.\r\n\r\nIf the knights of the shire continued for some time to sit and\r\nvote with the great barons, this was merely the effect of old\r\nassociation, a relic of the ancient parity of their feudal\r\nposition. This equality had already received a severe check by\r\nthe substitution of election for individual right of presence.\r\nThe cause which had led to this change continued at work; the\r\ndisparity of importance and wealth between the great barons and\r\nplain knights of the shire went on increasing; the remembrance of\r\nfeudal political right became weakened; and the social position\r\nof the knights of the shire daily became more different from that\r\nof the great barons. Their parliamentary position could not fail\r\nto follow the same course. All things combined to separate them\r\nmore and more.\r\n\r\nAt the same time every circumstance tended to associate the\r\nrepresentatives of the counties with those of the boroughs. They\r\nhad the same origin, and appeared in Parliament by virtue of the\r\nsame title--election. The tie which had attached the county\r\nelections to feudal right became progressively enfeebled.\r\nFurthermore, these two classes of deputies were alike\r\ncorrespondent to certain local interests. These interests were\r\noften identical or of the same nature. The inhabitants of the\r\ntowns situated in a county, and the rural landowners of the\r\ncounty, were often engaged in the same affairs, and frequently\r\nentertained the same claims and desires. Besides, the\r\ncounty-courts were a common centre at which they habitually\r\nassembled together. Both the county and borough elections\r\nfrequently took place in these courts. Thus, while certain causes\r\nincreasingly separated the knights of the shire from the great\r\nbarons, other causes approximated them more closely to the\r\nborough representatives. The analogy of social positions\r\nnaturally hastened the fusion of parliamentary positions.\r\n\r\n{423}\r\n\r\n         Present Constitution Of Parliament.\r\n\r\nLastly, the great barons constituted the chief council of the\r\nking. They often assembled around him in this capacity, and\r\nindependently of any convocation of the elected deputies. By\r\nreason of their personal importance, they engaged in public\r\naffairs, and took part in the government in an habitual and\r\npermanent manner. The representatives of the counties and\r\nboroughs, on the contrary, interfered in the administration of\r\npublic affairs only from time to time, in certain particular\r\ncases. They possessed rights and liberties, but they neither\r\ngoverned, nor contested with each other for the government, nor\r\nwere they constantly associated in it. Their political position\r\nwas in this respect the same, and was therefore very different\r\nfrom that of the great barons. All things tended, then, broadly\r\nto distinguish them from the latter class, and to connect them\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of Parliament in its present form is the result\r\nof all the above causes. It was accomplished in the middle of the\r\nfourteenth century, although some instances of separation between\r\nthe two elements of the House of Commons may subsequently be met\r\nwith. These cases very soon disappeared and the union became\r\ncomplete. One fact alone remained, and that was the superiority\r\nin importance and influence of the county representatives over\r\nthe representatives of boroughs, notwithstanding the habitual\r\ninferiority of their numbers. This fact, with the exception of\r\nonly a few intervals, is met with throughout the whole course of\r\nthe history of Parliament.\r\n\r\nThus was effected, on the one side, the separation of the Houses\r\nof Peers and Commons, and on the other, the union of the\r\ndifferent elements of the House of Commons into a single\r\nassembly, composed of members exercising the same rights and\r\nvoting on all occasions in common.\r\n\r\nThis is the great fact which has decided the political destiny of\r\nEngland. By themselves alone, the borough deputies would never\r\nhave possessed sufficient power and importance to form a House of\r\nCommons capable of resisting sometimes the king, and sometimes\r\nthe great barons, and of gaining an ever-increasing influence in\r\npublic affairs. But the aristocracy, or rather, the feudal\r\nnation, being divided into two parts, and the new nation which\r\nwas forming in the towns becoming combined with the county\r\nfreeholders there, arose from the combination a competent and\r\nimposing House of Commons.\r\n\r\n{424}\r\n\r\n         Early Importance Of The Commons.\r\n\r\nThere was a large body of the nation independent both of the king\r\nand of the great nobles. It happened also that the king could\r\nnot, as in France, make use of the Commons to annihilate the\r\npolitical rights and privileges of the ancient feudal system,\r\nwithout substituting new liberties in their places. On the\r\nContinent, the enfranchisement of the Commons definitively led to\r\nabsolute power. In England, a portion of the feudal class having\r\nunited with the Commons, they combined to defend their liberties.\r\nOn the other hand, the crown, supported by the great barons, who\r\ncould not hope to set up as petty independent sovereigns in their\r\nown domains, possessed sufficient power to defend itself in its\r\nturn. The great barons consequently were obliged to rally round\r\nthe throne. It is not true, though it is constantly reiterated,\r\nthat the aristocracy and people have made common cause in England\r\nagainst the regal power, and that English liberty has arisen out\r\nof that circumstance. But it is true that the division of the\r\nfeudal aristocracy having prodigiously augmented the power of the\r\nCommons, popular liberties at an early date possessed sufficient\r\nmeans of resistance, and the royal power received at the same\r\ntime sufficient support.\r\n\r\nThus, considering the division of Parliament into two houses\r\nunder the historic point of view, we see both how it was\r\neffected, and how favourable it has been to the establishment of\r\npopular liberty. Is this, then, all? Are this fact and its\r\nresults mere accidents arising out of circumstances peculiar to\r\nEngland, and to the state in which society happened to be in the\r\nfourteenth century? Or is this division of legislative power into\r\ntwo houses a constitutional form intrinsically good, and\r\neverywhere as well founded in reason as it was, in England, in\r\nthe necessities of the times? This question must be examined in\r\norder properly to appreciate the influence which this form has\r\nexercised on the development of the constitutional system in\r\nEngland, and rightly to understand its causes.\r\n\r\n{425}\r\n\r\n              Lecture XVIII.\r\n\r\n  Examination of the division of the legislative power into two\r\n  Houses.\r\n\r\n  Diversity of ideas on this subject.\r\n\r\n  Fundamental principle of the philosophic school.\r\n\r\n  Source of its errors.\r\n\r\n  Characteristics of the historic school.\r\n\r\n  Cause of the division of the British Parliament into two\r\n  Houses.\r\n\r\n  Derivation of this division from the fundamental principle of\r\n  representative government.\r\n\r\n  Its practical merit.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Division Of The Legislative Power.\r\n\r\nIn order to judge in itself of the division of the legislative\r\npower into two Chambers, and to estimate its merit, we must first\r\ndetach it from certain particular and purely local\r\ncharacteristics, which are not essentially inherent in it; and\r\nwhich have associated it in England with causes which are not in\r\nall times and places to be met with. Not a few writers have\r\nfallen into grave errors, on this and many other questions, by\r\nneglecting to take this step at the outset. Some have formed\r\ntheir judgment of this institution entirely from a few of the\r\ncauses which led to its establishment in England in the\r\nfourteenth century; and as, generally speaking, they did not\r\napprove either of these causes or their effects, and had a bad\r\nopinion of the social condition of which they formed part, they\r\nhave condemned the institution itself, appearing to believe that\r\nit was derived solely from that social condition, and could not\r\npossibly be detached from it. Others, on the contrary, struck\r\neither with the general reasons which may be urged in favour of\r\nthe institution, or with the good effects which it has produced\r\nin England and elsewhere, have adopted it exactly in that\r\nparticular form in which it was introduced among our neighbours\r\nby their ancient social condition, asserting that all the\r\ncharacteristics which it there presents are essential to it, and\r\neven constitute it. Thus, the institution has sometimes been\r\ncensured on account of particular facts which accompanied its\r\nestablishment and combined to produce it, and sometimes these\r\nfacts and their special consequences have been adopted as\r\nprinciples, simply because they were associated with an\r\ninstitution deemed intrinsically good.\r\n\r\n{426}\r\n         Philosophic And Historic Schools.\r\n\r\nThese two modes of judgment, both of which are equally erroneous,\r\ncharacterize the two schools, which may be called distinctively\r\nthe philosophic school and the historic school. As this twofold\r\nmethod of considering political questions has warped them,\r\nsometimes in one sense and sometimes in another, it appears to me\r\nthat it would be useful to offer some general observations on\r\nthis subject, which may afterwards be applied to the particular\r\nquestion with which we are now occupied.\r\n\r\nOne idea reigns in the philosophic school--that of Right. Right\r\nis constantly taken both as its starting-point, and as its goal.\r\nBut right itself requires to be investigated; before adopting it\r\nas a principle or pursuing it as an object, we must know what it\r\nis. To discover right, the philosophic school commonly confines\r\nitself to the individual. It takes hold of man, considers him\r\nisolatedly and in himself, as a rational and free being, and\r\ndeduces from an examination of his nature that which it\r\ndenominates his rights. Once in possession of these rights, they\r\nare advanced as a requirement of justice and reason, which ought\r\nto be applied to social facts as the sole rational and moral rule\r\nby which these facts should be judged, if judgment only be\r\nrequired--or instituted, if the object be to institute\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe historic school is held in bondage by another idea--that of\r\nFact. It does not, if possessed of any good sense, deny right: it\r\neven proposes right as its goal, but it never adopts it as its\r\nstarting-point. Fact is the ground to which everything is\r\nbrought; and as facts cannot be considered isolatedly, as they\r\nare all bound up together; and as the past itself is a fact with\r\nwhich the facts of the present are connected, it professes great\r\nrespect for the past and admits right only so far as it is\r\nfounded on anterior facts; or at least this school seeks to\r\nestablish right, only by uniting it closely with these facts, and\r\nstriving to deduce it from them. Such are the points of view, not\r\nexclusively, for that cannot be, but dominantly, of the two\r\nschools. How much is true, and how much erroneous in each? That\r\nis to say, what is there incomplete in both?\r\n\r\nThe philosophic school is correct in adopting Right not only as\r\nits end but also as its starting-point. It is right in\r\nmaintaining that an institution is not good, simply because it\r\nexists or has existed, and that there are rational principles by\r\nwhich all institutions should be judged, and rights superior to\r\nall facts,--rights which cannot be violated unless the facts\r\nwhich violate them are illegitimate, although real, and even\r\npowerful.\r\n\r\n{427}\r\n\r\n         Errors Of The Philosophic School.\r\n\r\nBut though right in standing upon this foundation, which is its\r\nprincipal characteristic, the philosophic school is often\r\nmistaken when it attempts to go farther. We say that it is\r\nmistaken, philosophically speaking, and independently of all\r\nideas of application and practical danger.\r\n\r\nIts two chief errors, in my opinion, are these:\r\n\r\n  I. Its researches after right are misdirected; and,\r\n\r\n  II. It mistakes the conditions under which right can be\r\n  realised.\r\n\r\nIt is not by considering man in isolation, in his single nature,\r\nand individually, that his rights may be discovered. The idea of\r\nright implies that of relation. Right can be declared only when\r\nrelation is established. The fact of a connexion, of an\r\napproximation, in a word, of society, is implied in the very word\r\n_right_. Right originates with society. Not that society, at\r\nits origin, created right by an arbitrary convention. Just as\r\ntruth exists before man becomes acquainted with it, so does right\r\nexist before it is realised in society. It is the legitimate and\r\nrational rule of society in every step of its development, and at\r\nevery moment of its existence. Rules exist before their\r\napplication; they would still exist even if they were never\r\napplied. Man does not make them. As a reasonable being, he is\r\ncapable of discovering and understanding them. As a free being,\r\nhe can either obey or violate them; but whether he be ignorant of\r\nthem or knowingly violate them, their reality, so far as they are\r\nrules, that is to say, their rational and moral reality, is\r\nindependent of him, superior and antecedent to his ignorance or\r\nhis knowledge, to the respect or neglect with which he treats\r\nthem. Laying down this principle then on the one side, that rule\r\nvirtually exists before the relation or society to which it\r\ncorresponds, and on the other side, that it is not manifested and\r\ndeclared until society is established, that is to say, that it\r\ncan only be applied when society really exists, we inquire, What\r\nis this right and how can it be discovered?\r\n\r\nRight, considered in itself, is the rule that each individual is\r\nmorally bound to observe and respect in his relations with\r\nanother individual; that is to say, the moral limit at which his\r\nlawful liberty is arrested and ceases in his action on that\r\nindividual; or, in other words, the right of a man is the limit\r\nbeyond which the will of another man cannot morally be exercised\r\nover him in the relation which unites them.\r\n\r\n{428}\r\n\r\n         True Rule Of Social Relations.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more certain than that every man in society has a\r\nright to expect that this limit will be maintained and respected\r\nas regards himself by other men and by society itself. This is\r\nthe primitive and unalterable right which he possesses in virtue\r\nof the dignity of his nature. If the philosophic school had\r\nconfined itself to laying down this principle, it would have been\r\nperfectly correct, and would have reminded society of the true\r\nmoral rule. But it has attempted to go further: it has pretended\r\nto determine, beforehand and in a general way, the exact limit in\r\nevery instance in which the will of individuals over each other,\r\nor of society over individuals, ceases to be legitimate. It has\r\nnot contented itself with establishing right in principle, but\r\nhas considered itself capable of enumerating all social rights\r\n_à priori_, and of reducing them to certain general formulæ\r\nwhich should comprise them all, and might thus be applied to\r\nevery relation to which society gives birth. By this it has been\r\nled to overlook many very positive rights, and to create many\r\npretended rights which have no reality. If it be true, as we have\r\nlaid it down, that right is the legitimate rule of a relation, it\r\nis plain that the relation must be known before the right which\r\nought to govern it can be understood. Now social relations,\r\nwhether between one man and another, or between one and several,\r\nare neither simple nor identical. They are infinitely multiplied,\r\nvaried, and interwoven; and right changes with relation. An\r\nexample will best explain our meaning. We will select the most\r\nsimple and natural of social relations, that of the father to the\r\nchild. Nobody will presume to assert that here no right exists,\r\nthat is to say, that neither the father nor the child have any\r\nrespective rights to be mutually observed, and that their will\r\nalone should arbitrarily regulate their reciprocal relations. In\r\nthe outset, whilst the child is devoid of reason, his will has\r\nlittle or no right: the right belongs entirely to the will of the\r\nfather, which even then is, doubtless, legitimate only so far as\r\nit is conformable to reason, but which is not and cannot be\r\nsubordinate to that of the child, on which it is exercised and\r\nwhich it directs.\r\n{429}\r\nIn proportion as reason becomes developed in the child, the right\r\nof the father's will becomes restricted; this right is always\r\nderived from the same principle, and ought to be exercised\r\naccording to the same law; but it no longer extends to the same\r\nlimit, but becomes changed and narrowed day by day with the\r\nprogress of the intellectual and moral development of the child,\r\nup to the age when at length the child, having become a man,\r\nfinds himself in a totally different relationship to his\r\nfather--a relationship in which another right holds sway, that is\r\nto say, in which the paternal right is enclosed within entirely\r\ndifferent limits, and is no longer exercised in the same way.\r\n\r\nIf, in the most simple of social relations, the right, though\r\nimmutable in its principle, suffers so many vicissitudes in its\r\napplication,--if the limit at which it stops is so continually\r\naltered, according as this relation changes in nature and\r\ncharacter--to a far greater extent will this be the case in all\r\nother social relations, which are infinitely more changeful and\r\ncomplicated. Every day old rights will perish; every day new ones\r\nwill arise; that is to say, different applications will daily be\r\nmade of the principle of right; and each occasion will vary at\r\nthe limits at which the right ceases, either on one side or the\r\nother, in the innumerable relations which constitute society.\r\n\r\nIt is not, then, a simple matter to determine right, nor can it\r\nbe done once for all, and according to certain general formulae.\r\nEither these formulæ must be reduced to this dominant truth, that\r\nno will, whether that of man over man, of society over the\r\nindividual, or of the individual over society, ought to be\r\nexercised contrary to justice and reason--or else these formulæ\r\nare vain; that is to say, they confine themselves to expressing\r\nthe principle of right, or try unsuccessfully to enumerate and\r\nregulate beforehand all its applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Impossibility Of Defining Rights.\r\n\r\nIn this there consists the first error of the philosophic school,\r\nthat, proud of having re-established the principle of right (a\r\nmatter, certainly, of immense importance), it has thenceforth\r\nesteemed itself, by continuing the same process, in a condition\r\nto recognise and define all rights; that is to say, all\r\napplications of the principle to social relations; an attempt\r\nwhich is most dangerous because it is impossible.\r\n\r\n{430}\r\n\r\n          Conditions Of Realizing Right.\r\n\r\nIt is not granted to man thus to discern, beforehand and at a\r\nglance, the whole extent of the rational laws which ought to\r\nregulate the relations of men both among themselves and with\r\nsociety in general. Doubtless, in each of these relations and in\r\nall the vicissitudes which they undergo, there is a principle\r\nwhich is their legitimate rule, and which determines rights; and\r\nit is this principle which must be discovered. But it is in the\r\nrelation itself, over which this principle should hold sway, that\r\nit is contained and may be discovered; it is intimately connected\r\nwith the nature and object of this relation, and these are the\r\nfirst data that must be studied in order to arrive at a knowledge\r\nof the principle. The philosophic school almost constantly\r\nneglects this labour. Instead of applying itself to the discovery\r\nof the true rights which correspond to the various social\r\nrelations, it arbitrarily constructs rights while pretending to\r\ndeduce them from the general and primitive principle of right; an\r\nattempt the reverse of philosophical, for special rights are\r\napplications, not consequences logically deduced from this\r\nprinciple; which is perfectly exhibited in each particular case,\r\nbut which does not contain within itself all the elements or all\r\nthe data required for the discovery of the right in every case.\r\n\r\nThe second error of the philosophic school is that of mistaking\r\nthe conditions under which right may be realised, that is to say,\r\nunder which it may become associated with facts, so as to\r\nregulate them.\r\n\r\nIt has long been said that two powers, right and might, truth and\r\nerror, good and evil, dispute the mastery of the world. What is\r\nnot so often said, though it is no less true, is this--they\r\ndispute for it because they simultaneously possess it, because\r\nthey co-exist in it everywhere at the same time. These two\r\npowers, so opposite in their nature, are never separated; in\r\nfact, they meet and mingle everywhere, forming by their\r\nco-existence and conflict that sort of impure and troubled unity\r\nwhich is the condition of man on earth; and which is reproduced\r\nin society as well as in individuals. All mundane facts bear this\r\ncharacter: there are none that are completely devoid of truth,\r\njustice, and goodness; none that are wholly and purely right,\r\ngood, or true. The simultaneous presence, and at the same time\r\nthe struggle, of might and right, forms the primitive and\r\ndominant fact which is reproduced in all other facts.\r\n\r\n{431}\r\n\r\n         Amalgamation Of Might And Right.\r\n\r\nThe philosophical school habitually loses sight of this intimate\r\nand inevitable amalgamation of might and right in all that exists\r\nand takes place upon the earth. Because these two powers are\r\nhostile, it thinks them separate. When it recognises some great\r\nviolation of right in an institution, a power, or a social\r\nrelation, it concludes that right is utterly absent from it; and\r\nimagines, at the same time, that if it can succeed in laying hold\r\nof this fact, and shaping and regulating it according to its own\r\nwill, it will secure the undisputed sway of right in that fact.\r\nHence the contempt, one might almost say the hatred, with which\r\nit judges and treats facts. Hence also, the violence with which\r\nit pretends to impose upon them those rules and forms which\r\nconstitute right in its eyes: what regard is due to that which is\r\nonly the work of might? what sacrifices are not due to that which\r\nwill be the triumph of right and reason? and the firmer the minds\r\nand the more energetic the characters of these reasoners, the\r\nmore will they be ruled and the further misguided by this method\r\nof viewing human things. Facts past and present do not deserve so\r\nmuch disdain, nor do future ones merit so much confidence. We do\r\nnot here adopt the views of the sceptics, nor would we regard all\r\nfacts as equally good or bad, and equally invested with or\r\ndestitute of reason and right. Nothing can be more contrary to\r\nour opinion. We firmly believe in the reality and legitimacy of\r\nright, in its struggle against might, and in the utility as well\r\nas the moral obligation of sustaining right in this eternal but\r\nprogressive combat. We only ask that, in this struggle, nothing\r\nmay be forgotten, and nothing confounded; and that indiscriminate\r\nattacks may not be made. We ask that because a fact may contain\r\nmany illegitimate elements, it is not therefore to be supposed\r\n_à priori_ to contain nothing besides, for such is not the\r\ncase. Right exists everywhere more or less, and everywhere right\r\nought to be respected. There is also more or less falsity and\r\nincompleteness in the speculative idea which we form to ourselves\r\nof right, and there will be unjust force and violence employed in\r\nthe strife in which this idea is made to prevail, and in the new\r\nfacts which will result from its triumph. This is not saying that\r\nthe combat ought to be suspended, or that the triumph ought not\r\nto be pursued. It is only necessary truthfully to recognise the\r\ncondition of human things, and never to lose sight of it, whether\r\nthe question be one of judgment or of action.\r\n\r\n{432}\r\n\r\n         Errors Of The Philosophic School.\r\n\r\nThis is what the philosophic school can rarely consent to do.\r\nTaking right for the point at which it sets out, and also that at\r\nwhich it aims, it forgets that facts subsist between these two\r\nextremes--actual and existing facts, independent data; a\r\ncondition which of imperative necessity must be submitted to,\r\nwhen the extension of right is sought after, since these facts\r\nare the very matters to which right must be applied. This school\r\nbegins by neglecting one of the fundamental elements of the\r\nproblem which it has to solve; it falls into reverie, and\r\nconstructs imaginary facts, whilst it ought to be operating on\r\nreal facts. And when compelled to quit hypotheses, and deal with\r\nrealities, it becomes irritated at the obstacles which it meets,\r\nand unreasonably condemns the facts which throw them in its way.\r\nThus, through having desired impossibilities, it is led to forget\r\na part of that which is actually true. Society at every period\r\nswerves more or less from the general type of right; that is to\r\nsay, the facts which constitute its material and moral condition\r\nare more or less regulated according to right, and also become in\r\na greater or less degree susceptible of receiving a more absolute\r\nform, a more perfect rule, and of continually assimilating more\r\nclosely to reason and truth; and this it is which must be\r\nabsolutely studied and understood before passing a judgment on\r\nthese facts, or endeavouring to effect their change and\r\nimprovement. Perfection is the aim of human nature and of human\r\nsociety; perfection is the law of their existence, but\r\nimperfection is its condition. The philosophic school does not\r\naccept this condition; and is thus misled in its endeavours\r\ntowards attaining perfection, and even in its own idea of the\r\nperfection to which it aspires.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Errors Of The Historic School.\r\n\r\nThe historic school possesses other characteristics, and falls\r\ninto different errors. With the utmost respect for facts, it\r\neasily allows itself to be induced to attribute to them merits to\r\nwhich they are not entitled; to see more reason and justice, that\r\nis to say, more _right_, in them than they really contain,\r\nand to resist even the slightest bold attempt to judge and\r\nregulate them according to principles more conformable to general\r\nreason.\r\n{433}\r\nIt is even inclined to deny these principles, to maintain that\r\nthere is no rational and invariable type of right that man can\r\ntake for a guide in his efforts or his opinions: an error of\r\ngreat magnitude, and sufficient to place this school,\r\nphilosophically considered, in a subordinate rank. What then is\r\nperfection, if there is no ideal perfection to be aimed at? What\r\nis the progress of real rights, if there is no rational right to\r\ncomprehend them all? What is the human mind, if it is incapable\r\nof penetrating far beyond actual realities in its knowledge of\r\nthis rational right? and how can it judge of them except by\r\ncomparing them with this sublime type, which it never holds in\r\nfull possession, but which it cannot deny without abnegating\r\nitself, and losing every fixed rule and guiding thread?\r\nDoubtless, facts command respect, because they are a condition, a\r\nnecessity; and they deserve it, because they always contain a\r\ncertain measure of right. But the judgment ought never to be\r\nenslaved by them, nor should it attribute absolute legitimacy to\r\nreality. Is it so difficult, then, to perceive that evil is evil\r\neven when it is powerful and inevitable? The historic school\r\nconstantly endeavours to evade this confession. It tries to\r\nexplain every institution, and to abstain from giving judgment\r\nupon them, as if explanation and judgment were not two distinct\r\nacts, which possess no right over one another. It never suffers\r\nthe institution of a comparison between the real state of any\r\nsociety and the rational state of society in general; as if the\r\nreal, or even the possible, were the limit of reason; as if, when\r\njudging, reason should be deposed, because when applied it is\r\ncompelled to undergo conditions and to yield to obstacles which\r\nit cannot conquer. The historic school would be perfectly right\r\nif it confined itself to the careful study of facts, bringing to\r\nlight that portion of right which they contain, and searching out\r\nthe degree of perfection which they are capable of receiving, and\r\nif it restricted itself to maintaining that it is not easy to\r\ndistinguish real rights, unjust to condemn facts _en masse_,\r\nand impossible and dangerous to neglect them altogether. But when\r\nit undertakes to legitimise facts by facts; when it refuses to\r\napply the invariable law of justice and rational right to all, it\r\nabandons every principle, falls into a sort of absurd and\r\nshameful fatalism, and disinherits man and society of that which\r\nis most pure in their nature, most legitimate in their\r\npretensions, and most noble in their aspirations.\r\n\r\n{434}\r\n\r\n         Comparison Of The Two Schools.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the philosophic school possesses the merit of\r\neverywhere acknowledging the principle of right, and adopting it\r\nas the unchangeable rule of its judgment on facts. Its errors\r\nconsist in its knowledge of facts being slight, imperfect, and\r\nprecipitate; and in not allowing to facts the power which is\r\ninseparable from them, and the degree of legitimacy which they\r\nalways contain. The historic school is better acquainted with\r\nfacts, appreciates their causes and consequences more equitably,\r\neffects a more faithful analysis of their elements, and arrives\r\nat a more exact knowledge of particular rights as well as at a\r\nmore just estimate of practicable reforms. But it is deficient in\r\ngeneral and fixed principles: its judgments fluctuate according\r\nto chance; and accordingly it almost always hesitates to come to\r\na conclusion, and never succeeds in satisfying the mind, which\r\nthe philosophic school, on the contrary, always impresses\r\nstrongly, at the risk of leading it astray.\r\n\r\nWe have insisted on the distinctive characters and opposite\r\nerrors of these two schools, because we meet with them\r\nunceasingly when investigating how institutions and social facts\r\nhave been appreciated and understood. Of this we have given an\r\nexample by indicating the two points of view under which the\r\ndivision of the legislative power into two Chambers has been\r\ncommonly considered. The historic school approves and recommends\r\nit; but it often founds its reasons on illegitimate facts, and\r\nadheres too absolutely to the forms which this institution has\r\nassumed in the past, while it refrains from attaching itself to\r\nany rigorous and rational principle. The philosophic school has\r\nlong maintained, and many of its disciples still believe, that\r\nthis is an accidental and arbitrary institution, which is not\r\nfounded on reason and the very nature of things.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider this institution in itself, after having\r\ndisentangled it from that which, in England, has related merely\r\nto its actual origin, and to the local circumstances in the midst\r\nof which it took its rise.\r\n\r\n{435}\r\n\r\n         Origin Of The House Of Peers.\r\n\r\nIt is beyond doubt that the immense inequality of wealth and\r\ncredit,--in a word, of power and social importance, which existed\r\nbetween the great barons and the other political classes of the\r\nnation, whether freeholders or burgesses, was in England the sole\r\ncause of the institution of the House of Peers. No political\r\ncombination or idea of public right had anything to do with its\r\nformation. The personal importance of a certain number of\r\nindividuals, in this case, created their right. Political order\r\nis necessarily the expression, the reflection, of social order.\r\nIn this stage of civilisation especially, power is indisputably\r\nconveyed from society into the government. There was a House of\r\nPeers because there were men who, bearing no comparison with\r\nothers, could not remain confounded with them, exercising only\r\nthe same rights, and possessing no greater amount of authority.\r\n\r\nTo the same cause must be ascribed several of the leading\r\ncharacteristics of the House of Peers; the hereditary\r\ntransmission of social importance, wealth, and power (the result\r\nof the feudal system as regards property), carried with it the\r\ninheritance of political importance. This is proved by the fact,\r\nthat originally the sole hereditary peers were the barons by\r\nfeudal tenure. Hereditary right did not originally belong to the\r\n_barons by writ;_ although individually summoned to the\r\nUpper House, they exercised, when sitting there, the same rights.\r\nThe judicial functions of the House of Peers also had the same\r\nsource. At first they belonged to the general assembly of the\r\ndirect vassals of the king. When the greater number of these\r\nvassals ceased to attend that assembly, the great barons who\r\nalone attended, continued to exercise nearly all its functions,\r\nand especially its judicial authority. Of this they continued to\r\nhold possession when the knights re-entered Parliament by means\r\nof election. Thus, a right, which originally devolved upon the\r\ngeneral assembly of the political nation, became concentrated in\r\nthe new House of Peers, at least in every case unaffected by the\r\nnew jurisdictions instituted by the king. On examining in all its\r\ndetails the political part now performed in England by the House\r\nof Peers, it will be found that a great number of its attributes\r\nare only the results of ancient facts, that they are not inherent\r\nin the institution itself, but solely derived from the social\r\nposition of the great barons; and at the same time it will be\r\nperceived that all these facts are connected with the general and\r\nprimitive fact of the great inequality then subsisting between\r\nthe great barons and the citizens.\r\n\r\n{436}\r\n         Advantages Of A House Of Peers.\r\n\r\nAs this inequality really existed, and could not fail to\r\nre-appear in the government, it was very fortunate for England\r\nthat it assumed the form of the House of Peers. Inequality is\r\nnever more oppressive and fatal than when displayed solely for\r\nits own advantage, and in an individual interest. This is the\r\ninvariable result when the upper ranks are dispersed over the\r\ncountry, and are brought into contact with, and into the presence\r\nof, their inferiors alone. If, instead of uniting in the House of\r\nPeers to exercise, as members of that assembly, the power they\r\npossessed over society, the great barons had each remained on his\r\nown estates, their superiority and power would have weighed\r\nheavily on all their vassals and farmers, and social emancipation\r\nwould have been very much retarded. Every baron would then have\r\nhad to do with his inferiors alone. In the House of Peers, on the\r\ncontrary, he had to deal with his equals; and to obtain influence\r\nin that assembly, and effect his will, he was obliged to have\r\nrecourse to discussion, to the advancement of public reasons, and\r\nto constitute himself the exponent of some interest superior to\r\nhis own personal interest, and of opinions around which it would\r\nbe possible for men to unite together. Thus men, who, had they\r\nremained isolated on their domains, would have acted only upon\r\ninferiors and for their own interest, were constrained, when they\r\nhad met together, to act upon their equals, and for the interests\r\nof the masses, whose support alone could increase their power in\r\nthe frequent struggles which this new situation imposed upon\r\nthem. Thus by the single fact of its concentration, the high\r\nfeudal aristocracy insensibly changed its character. Each of its\r\nmembers possessed rights originally derived entirely from his own\r\npower, which he came to the House of Peers to exercise solely for\r\nhis own interest; but when once brought together into each\r\nother's presence, all these individual interests experienced the\r\nnecessity of seeking new means of obtaining credit and authority\r\nelsewhere than in themselves. Personal powers were constrained to\r\nsink themselves into a public power. An assembly composed of\r\nindividual superiorities, jealous only to preserve and increase\r\ntheir power, became gradually converted into a national\r\ninstitution, compelled to adapt itself, in many points, to the\r\ninterest of all.\r\n\r\n{437}\r\n\r\n         Results Of Its Establishment.\r\n\r\nAs I have elsewhere had occasion to say, one of the greatest\r\nvices of the feudal system was to localise sovereignty, and to\r\nbring it everywhere, so to speak, to the door of those over whom\r\nit was exercised. The formation of the House of Peers weakened\r\nthis evil in England, and thus, at least in a political point of\r\nview, struck a deadly blow at feudalism.\r\n\r\nFurther, the great barons thus formed into a body, had the power\r\nand duty of defending in common their rights and liberties\r\nagainst the royal power; and their resistance, instead of\r\nconsisting in a series of isolated wars, as was the case in\r\nFrance, immediately assumed the character of a collective and\r\ntruly political resistance, founded on certain general principles\r\nof right and liberty. Now there is something contagious in these\r\nprinciples and their language, which very soon extends them\r\nbeyond the limits within which they are at first enclosed. Right\r\ncalls forth right, liberty engenders liberty. The demands and\r\nresistance of the great barons provoked similar demands and\r\nresistance in other classes of the nation. Without the\r\nconcentration of the high aristocracy in the House of Peers, the\r\nHouse of Commons would probably have never been formed. From all\r\nthese facts flows this consequence, that when great inequality\r\nactually exists in society between different classes of citizens,\r\nit is not only natural but useful to the progress of justice and\r\nliberty, that the superior class should be collected and\r\nconcentrated into a great public power, in which individual\r\nsuperiorities become placed on a more elevated level than that of\r\npersonal interest; they learn to treat with their equals, to meet\r\nwith opposition, and to furnish an example of the defence of\r\nliberties and rights; while by exposing themselves in some sort\r\nto the view of the whole nation, they experience by this fact\r\nalone the necessity of adapting themselves, to a certain extent,\r\nto its opinions, sentiments, and interests.\r\n\r\n{438}\r\n\r\n         Is A House Of Peers Advantageous?\r\n\r\nBut, it may be said, a social inequality of sufficient magnitude\r\nto occasion the formation of such a power, is neither a universal\r\nfact, nor one in itself good and desirable; and under this point\r\nof view the House of Peers, as it is constituted in England, was\r\nsimply a remedy for an evil. There can be no doubt that the\r\naccumulation of land, wealth, and positive power which belonged\r\nto the great barons, and the securing of all these social\r\nadvantages, were the result of violence, and as contrary to the\r\ninternal tendency as to the rational principles of society in\r\ngeneral. If then the division of the legislative power into two\r\nChambers is derived only from such causes, it might in certain\r\ncases be inevitable and even beneficial; but where these causes\r\nare not met with, nothing would recommend it, or ought to make\r\nits necessity a matter of regret. The equitable and natural\r\ndistribution of social advantages, their rapid circulation, the\r\nfree competition of rights and powers--this is the object, as it\r\nis the rational law of the social condition. An institution\r\nwhich, in itself and by its nature, is opposed to this object and\r\nderogates from this law, contains nothing which ought to lead to\r\nits adoption when not imposed by necessity.\r\n\r\nIs this the case with regard to the division of the legislative\r\npower into two Chambers, setting aside those particular\r\ncharacteristics which, in the English House of Peers, are derived\r\nsolely from local and accidental facts, and cannot be referred to\r\nrational causes of universal validity?\r\n\r\nBefore considering this question in its relation to the\r\nfundamental principle of representative government, some\r\nobservations are necessary.\r\n\r\n{439}\r\n\r\n         Two Tendencies In Society.\r\n\r\nIt is by no means true, that similar inequalities to those which\r\nproduced the preponderance of the great barons in England, and a\r\npermanent classification of society in conformity to these facts,\r\nare natural conditions of the social state. Providence does not\r\nalways sell her benefits at so high a price to the human race,\r\nand has not rested the very existence of society on this\r\ndenomination, this immovable constitution of privilege. Reason\r\nmust believe, and facts prove, that society can not only subsist,\r\nbut is even better off in another condition; in a condition in\r\nwhich the principle of free competition exercises more dominion,\r\nand where the different social classes are more nearly allied. It\r\nis certain, however, that there exist in society two tendencies,\r\nequally legitimate in their principle, and equally salutary in\r\ntheir effects, although in permanent opposition to each other.\r\nThe one is the tendency to the production of inequality, the\r\nother, the tendency to maintain or restore equality between\r\nindividuals. Both are natural and indestructible: this is a fact\r\nwhich requires no proof, the aspect of the world displays it\r\neverywhere; and if we look within, we shall perceive it in\r\nourselves. Who does not desire, in some respect or another, to\r\nraise himself above his equals? and who would not also wish, in\r\nsome particular, to bring down his superiors to an equality with\r\nhimself? These two tendencies, considered in their principle, are\r\nequally legitimate: the one is attached to the right of the\r\nnatural superiorities which exist in the moral as well as in the\r\nphysical order of the universe; the other, to the right of every\r\nman to that justice which desires that no arbitrary force should\r\ndeprive him of any of the social advantages which he possesses,\r\nor might acquire, unaided and without injury to his fellows. To\r\nprevent natural superiorities from displaying themselves, and\r\nexercising the power that belongs to them, is to create a violent\r\ninequality, and to mutilate the human race in its noblest parts.\r\nTo enslave men in regard to those rights which are common to all,\r\nby reason of the similitude of their nature, to unequal laws\r\nimposed or maintained by force, is to insult human nature and to\r\nforget its imperishable dignity. In fine, these two tendencies\r\nare equally salutary in their effects: without the one, society\r\nwould be inert and lifeless; without the other, might alone would\r\ndominate, and right would for ever be suppressed. In considering\r\nthem as respects that which is legitimate and moral in each, let\r\nus ask what is this tendency to inequality but the desire to\r\nelevate ourselves, to extend our influence, and to bring to light\r\nand effect the triumph of that portion of moral power which is\r\nnaturally placed by the will of God the Creator, in each\r\nparticular individual? and is it not this impulse which\r\nconstitutes the life and determines the progress of the human\r\nrace? On the other hand, what is this tendency to equality except\r\nresistance to force, to capricious arbitrary wills, and the\r\ndesire to yield obedience only to justice and true law?\r\nDoubtless, in both these tendencies, the bad as well as the the\r\ngood parts of our nature display themselves: there is a taint of\r\ninsolence in the desire of self-elevation, and of envy in the\r\npassion for equality. Injustice and violence may be employed\r\neither to abase superiors or to surpass equals; but in that\r\nconflict of good and evil, which is everywhere the condition of\r\nman, it is not the less true that the two tendencies of which I\r\nam speaking constitute the very principle of social life, the\r\ntwofold cause which makes the human race advance in the career of\r\nimprovement, which leads it back when it wanders astray, and\r\nurges it forward when perverse powers or wills seek to arrest its\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\n{440}\r\n\r\n         Tendency To Inequality.\r\n\r\nThe tendency to inequality is then a fact inevitable in itself,\r\nlegitimate in its principle, and salutary in its effects, if it\r\nis restrained by the law of competition, that is to say, beneath\r\nthe condition of a permanent and free struggle with the tendency\r\nto equality, which, in the order of Providence, appears to be the\r\nfact by which it is destined to be balanced. In every country\r\nthere will always arise and exist a certain number of great\r\nindividual superiorities, who will seek an analogous place in\r\ngovernment to that which they occupy in society. They ought not\r\nto obtain it for their personal interest, nor to extend it beyond\r\nwhat comports with the public interest, nor should they retain it\r\nlonger than they possess the title in virtue of which they\r\nassumed it, that is to say, their actual importance, nor should\r\nthey preserve this title by means violative of the principle of\r\nfree competition, and the maintenance of the rights which are\r\ncommon to all. All this is indubitable, but, this being allowed,\r\nthere will still remain the necessity of introducing and\r\nconcentrating among the superior powers all the great\r\nsuperiorities of the country, in order to engage them in the\r\ntransaction of public affairs, and in the defence of the general\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nThis, as we have seen, is the sole object of the representative\r\nsystem: its precise purpose is to discover and concentrate the\r\nnatural and real superiorities of the country, in order to apply\r\nthem to its government. Now, is it good in itself, and in\r\nconformity with the fundamental principle of this system, to\r\napply only one method of seeking out these superiorities, and to\r\ngather them all into a single voting urn? that is to say, must\r\nthey be united in one single assembly, formed upon the same\r\nconditions, after the same tests, and by the same mode? We now\r\nreach the pith of the question.\r\n\r\n{441}\r\n\r\n         Opposition To Absolute Power.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the representative system is the destruction of\r\nall sovereignty of permanent right, that is to say, of all\r\nabsolute power upon earth. The question of what is now called\r\n_omnipotence_ has at all times been agitated. If by this is\r\nunderstood an actually definitive power, in the terms of\r\nestablished laws, such a power always exists in society, under a\r\nmultitude of names and forms: for wherever there is a matter to\r\nbe decided and completed, there must be a power to decide and\r\ncomplete it. Thus, in the family, the father exercises the power\r\nof definitively determining, in certain particulars, the conduct\r\nand destiny of his children; in a well regulated municipality,\r\nthe municipal council definitively enacts the local budget; in\r\ncivil trials, certain tribunals give final judgment upon cases\r\nsubmitted to their decision; and in the political system,\r\nelectoral omnipotence belongs to the electors. Definitive power\r\nis thus disseminated through the social state, and is necessarily\r\nmet with everywhere. Does this imply that a power ought somewhere\r\nto exist, which possesses omnipotence by right, that is to say,\r\nwhich has the right to do anything it pleases? That would be\r\nabsolute power; and it is the formal design of the representative\r\nsystem, as well as the object of all its institutions, to provide\r\nagainst the existence of such a power, and to take care that\r\nevery power shall be submitted to certain trials, meet with\r\nobstacles, undergo opposition, and, in fine, be deprived of sway\r\nuntil it has either proved its legitimacy, or given reason for\r\npresuming it.\r\n\r\nThere is not, then, and there cannot be, any omnipotence by\r\nright, that is to say, any power which should be allowed to say:\r\n\"that is good and just because I have so decided it;\" and every\r\neffort of political science, every institution, ought to tend to\r\nthe prevention of such a power being anywhere formed; and should\r\nprovide that the actual omnipotence which exists under so many\r\nnames in society, should everywhere meet with restraints and\r\nobstacles enough to prevent its conversion into an omnipotence by\r\nright.\r\n\r\nUntil the summit of society is reached, and while those powers\r\nonly are constituted, above which other permanent powers will be\r\nplaced for the purpose of controlling them, and with power to\r\nenforce their authority, this end appears easy to attain.\r\n\r\n{442}\r\n\r\n         Bulwarks Against Absolute Power.\r\n\r\nJudicial power, municipal power, and every second class power may\r\nbe definitive without much danger, because if they are abused in\r\na manner likely to become fatal, the legislative or executive\r\npower will be there to repress them. But we must necessarily come\r\nat last to the supreme power, to that power which superintends\r\nall others, and is not itself ruled or restrained by any visible\r\nand constituted power. Shall the right of omnipotence appertain\r\nto this? Certainly not, whatever may be its form or name. It\r\nwill, however, be always prone to aspire to it, and able to usurp\r\nit, for in the political system it possesses omnipotence, and of\r\nthis it cannot be deprived; for in reference to general\r\ninterests, as well as to local and private interests, a\r\ndefinitive power is a necessity.\r\n\r\nHere then, all the foresight of the politician ought to be\r\ndisplayed: he will need all his art and all his efforts, to\r\nprevent actual omnipotence from asserting its inherent\r\nrightfulness, and general definitive power from becoming absolute\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThis result is endeavoured to be secured by a variety of means:\r\n\r\n  I. by recognising the individual rights of citizens,--the\r\n  effect of which is to superintend, control, and limit this\r\n  central supreme power, and constantly to subject it to the law\r\n  of reason and justice to which it ought to be subordinated;\r\n  this is the object of the jury, of the liberty of the press,\r\n  and of publicity of all kinds:\r\n\r\n  II. by constituting, in a distinct and independent way, the\r\n  principal powers of the second class, such as the judicial and\r\n  municipal powers; on such a plan that these being themselves\r\n  repressed and restrained when necessary by the central power,\r\n  may restrain and repress it in their turn if it should attempt\r\n  to become absolute:\r\n\r\n  III. by organising the central power itself in such a manner as\r\n  to make it very difficult for it to usurp rightful omnipotence,\r\n  and to provide that it shall meet with such oppositions and\r\n  obstacles within itself as will not admit of its attaining\r\n  actual omnipotence except under laborious conditions, the\r\n  accomplishment of which gives ground to presume that it does in\r\n  effect act in accordance with reason and justice; that is to\r\n  say, that it possesses legitimacy.\r\n\r\n{443}\r\n\r\n         Secret Of Political Liberty.\r\n\r\nThis last description of means is the only one connected with the\r\nquestion that now occupies our attention. The division of the\r\nlegislative power into two Chambers has precisely this object. It\r\nis directed against the easy acquisition of actual omnipotence at\r\nthe summit of the social system, and consequently against the\r\ntransformation of actual omnipotence into rightful omnipotence.\r\nIt is therefore conformable to the fundamental principle of the\r\nrepresentative system, and is a necessary consequence of it.\r\n\r\nWhy is it undesirable that the legislative and executive powers,\r\nthat is to say, the entire supreme power, should reside either in\r\none man or in a single assembly? why does tyranny always spring\r\nfrom these two forms of government? Because it is in the nature\r\nof things, that a power which has no equal should think itself\r\nrightfully sovereign, and should very soon become absolute. It\r\nhas happened thus in democracies, aristocracies, and monarchies;\r\nwherever actually sovereign power has been conferred upon a\r\nsingle man, or a single body of men, that man, or that body, has\r\nassumed to be rightfully sovereign; and more or less frequently,\r\nand with greater or less violence, it has exercised despotism.\r\n\r\nThe art of politics, the secret of liberty is, then, to provide\r\nequals for every power for which it cannot provide superiors.\r\nThis is the principle which ought to preside in the organisation\r\nof the central government: for on these terms only can the\r\nestablishment of despotism at the centre of the State be\r\nprevented.\r\n\r\nNow if the legislative power is entrusted to a single assembly,\r\nand the executive power to one man, or if the legislative power\r\nis divided between one assembly and the executive power, is it\r\npossible for each of these powers to possess sufficient force and\r\nconsistence to admit of the necessary equality between them, that\r\nis to say, to secure that neither shall become the sole and\r\nundisputed sovereign power? Such an example has never been\r\nwitnessed: wherever the central power has been thus constituted,\r\na struggle has arisen, which has resulted, according to the\r\ntimes, either in the annihilation of the executive power by the\r\nlegislative assembly, or of the legislative assembly by the\r\nexecutive power. Some countries have been governed by a single\r\nassembly, others by several assemblies, of which some have been\r\naristocratic and others democratic; while all have contested with\r\neach other for the sovereignty. These various forms of government\r\nhave given rise either to tyranny or to continued commotions, and\r\nhave nevertheless endured. But a government in which the\r\nlegislative assembly and the executive power have remained\r\ndistinct, preserving their personality and their independence,\r\nand reciprocally limiting each other, is a phenomenon without\r\nexample, either in antiquity or in modern times. One of these\r\npowers has always speedily succumbed, or been soon reduced to a\r\nstate of subordination and dependence equivalent to nonentity, at\r\nleast as regarded the essential purposes for which it was\r\ninstituted.\r\n\r\n{444}\r\n\r\n         Division Of The Central Power.\r\n\r\nThis could not fail to be the case. Equality is impossible\r\nbetween powers which are completely dissimilar, either in their\r\nnature, or in their means of obtaining power or credit. The\r\ndominion of one person, that is to say, the pure monarchical form\r\nof government, derives its springs and means of action from\r\ncertain dispositions of human nature, and certain conditions of\r\nsociety. The full and exclusive rule of a single assembly derives\r\nthe same from other dispositions and other social circumstances;\r\naccording as one or other class of these circumstances\r\npredominate, kings have abolished assemblies, and assemblies have\r\noverthrown kings. But the co-existence of these two systems of\r\ngovernment, when confronted with each other and acting in direct\r\nopposition, is impossible. They do not then act as a restraint\r\nupon each other, but they wage a war of extermination: such an\r\nevent has accordingly never been met with except in revolutionary\r\ntimes: it may possibly have been an unavoidable condition of such\r\nepochs; but then it has always involved one or other of these\r\nforms of despotism: it has never become the basis of a free and\r\nregular government.\r\n\r\nWhen it is once admitted that the division of the central power\r\nis indispensable, in order to prevent all usurpation of rightful\r\nomnipotence, or, at least, to render such usurpation infrequent\r\nand difficult, it necessarily follows that this division ought to\r\nbe effected in such a way that the resulting powers shall be\r\ncapable of regular co-existence, that is to say, of mutually\r\nrestraining, limiting, and compelling each other to seek in\r\ncommon for that reason, truth, and justice, which ought to\r\nregulate their will and preside over their actions. It is\r\nessential that neither of these powers should elevate itself so\r\nmuch above the others as to be able to throw off their yoke; for\r\nthe excellence of the system consists precisely in their mutual\r\ndependence, and in the efforts which it imposes on them to secure\r\nunanimity. Now there can be no mutual dependence, except between\r\npowers which are invested with a certain degree of independence,\r\nand with strength enough to maintain it.\r\n\r\n{445}\r\n\r\n         Its Relation To Representative Government.\r\n\r\nThe division of the central power, or of the actual sovereignty,\r\nbetween the executive power and two legislative assemblies is,\r\ntherefore, strictly derived from the fundamental principle of the\r\nrepresentative system; or rather it is the sole constitutional\r\nform which fully corresponds to this principle, and guarantees\r\nits maintenance, since this is the only form which, by providing\r\nequals for powers which admit of no superiors, prevents them all\r\nfrom claiming and usurping rightful sovereignty, that is to say,\r\nabsolute power.\r\n\r\nWhy has this truth been so frequently forgotten? why has this\r\nconstitutional form been so often repudiated by men who,\r\nnevertheless, desired to establish representative\r\ngovernment?--Because they have forgotten the principle of this\r\nform of government. At the very moment when they were directing\r\ntheir efforts against absolute power, they have imagined that it\r\nlegitimately existed somewhere; and they have attributed it to\r\nsociety itself,--to the entire people. They have thus proved\r\nwanting in consistency and courage in their opposition to\r\nabsolute power; and either have not known, or have not dared, to\r\npursue it wherever it might be found; to leave it no refuge; to\r\ndenounce and banish it under every possible name and form. Thus,\r\nadmitting the existence of one sole sovereign, naturally and\r\neternally legitimate, they have also been obliged to admit an\r\nundivided representation of this undivided sovereign. The\r\nsovereignty of the people, thus understood, necessarily carries\r\nwith it the unity of the legislative power: and when tyranny has\r\nsprung from it, when the lessons of experience have led men to\r\nseek other combinations, when it has been considered right to\r\ndivide the legislative assembly, it has been done with the\r\nassertion, that such a step was contrary to the principle of\r\nrepresentative government, but necessary: that principles cannot\r\nrigorously be followed, and that it is necessary to believe in\r\nthe theory, but not to practise it. Such language is an insult to\r\ntruth, for truth never contains evil; and when evil does appear\r\nanywhere, it arises not from truth but from error.\r\n{446}\r\nIf the consequences of a principle are fatal, it is not because\r\nthe principle, though in itself true, is not applicable, but\r\nbecause it really is not true. It has been said by the advocates\r\nof divine right: There is only one God; there ought therefore to\r\nbe only one king; and all power belongs to him because he is the\r\nrepresentative of God. The advocates of the sovereignty of the\r\npeople say: There is only one people; there ought therefore to be\r\nonly one legislative assembly, for that represents the people.\r\nThe error is the same in both cases, and in each instance it\r\nleads equally to despotism. There is only one God, that is\r\ncertain: but God exists nowhere upon the earth, for neither is\r\nany man nor is the entire people God, nor do any perfectly know\r\nhis law, or constantly desire it. No actual power, then, ought to\r\nbe undivided, for the unity of actual power supposes a plenitude\r\nof rightful power which nobody possesses or can possess.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Good Effects Of This Division.\r\n\r\nFar, then, from the division of legislative power being a\r\nderogation from the principles of political liberty, it is, on\r\nthe contrary, in perfect harmony with these principles, and is\r\nspecially directed against the establishment of absolute power.\r\n\r\nHaving this [thus?] established the principle, it would be easy\r\nto consider it in practice, and to demonstrate its good effects.\r\nIt would be easy to prove that it is indispensible for realising\r\nthe responsibility of the executive power; for curbing inordinate\r\nambition, and turning every kind of superiority to the profit of\r\nthe State; for preventing fundamental institutions, the public\r\nrights of citizens, and all the higher branches of legislation,\r\nfrom being treated as simple measures of government, and made\r\nsubject to the instability of political experience: but these\r\nconsiderations would lead me too far; I wished to establish this\r\nconstitutional form in principle, because it is owing to the want\r\nof such foundations that it has long been regarded with mistrust\r\nand doubt by many enlightened men. Its utility is never disputed;\r\nits good results are acknowledged; but men are generally ignorant\r\nhow it can be made to agree with the general principles of a free\r\ngovernment; and it has been found, not without reason, that these\r\nprinciples would be weakened by any derogation from them. In\r\ntimes when the human race is subject to regenerative influences,\r\nempiricism is never the ruling spirit: man then requires some\r\nrational and rigorous principles which may furnish a solution to\r\nevery difficulty; and he mistrusts experience when he finds her\r\ncounsels at variance with those primitive axioms which his reason\r\nhas firmly adopted. This is our natural disposition: let us not\r\nlament it, it characterises all great epochs; it is then only\r\nnecessary rigidly to examine principles themselves, and to grant\r\ndominion to those ideas only which truly deserve it.\r\n\r\n{447}\r\n\r\n         How Should It Be Effected?\r\n\r\nA second question remains for consideration: it is, to ascertain\r\nhow the division of the legislative power into two houses ought\r\nto be effected, and what should be the mode of formation, what\r\nthe attributes and the relations of the two assemblies. This, at\r\nleast to a great degree, is a question of circumstance, the\r\nsolution of which is almost entirely dependent upon the state of\r\nsociety, its internal constitution, and the manner in which\r\nwealth, influence, and intelligence, are distributed; this is\r\nsufficiently indicated by what I have said about the causes that\r\nled to the formation of the House of Peers in England. It is\r\nevident, for example, that those countries in which there was no\r\nsuch inequality as then existed between the different classes of\r\nsociety, would be ill adapted for a division of the legislative\r\npower based upon the same ideas, presenting the same\r\ncharacteristics, and entailing the same consequences. Perhaps the\r\nonly general idea which can be laid down beforehand upon this\r\nsubject is, that the two assemblies should not proceed from the\r\nsame source, and be constituted in the same manner; in a word,\r\nthat they should not be exactly alike. The object of their\r\nseparation would then be defeated, for their similitude would\r\ndestroy the mutual independence which is the condition of their\r\nutility.\r\n\r\n{448}\r\n\r\n               Lecture XIX.\r\n\r\n  Power and attributes of the British Parliament in the\r\n  fourteenth century.\r\n\r\n  At its origin, and subsequent to its complete development, the\r\n  Parliament retained the name of the Great Council of the\r\n  kingdom.\r\n\r\n  Difference between its attributes and its actual power at these\r\n  two epochs.\r\n\r\n  Absorption of almost the entire government by the Crown;\r\n  gradual resumption of its influence by the Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Original Name Of The Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe first name borne in England by the assembly which was\r\nsucceeded by the Parliament, was, as you have seen, that of the\r\ngreat council, the common council of the kingdom, _magnum\r\ncommune consilium regni_. The same name has also been given to\r\nthe Parliament in England for the last two centuries, when it is\r\ndesired to indicate completely the nature of its interference in\r\nthe government, and the part which it there performs. It is\r\ncalled the great national council: the king governs in\r\nParliament, that is to say, with the advice and consent of the\r\ngreat council of the nation.\r\n\r\nThus, both at the origin of the British government, and since it\r\nhas attained its complete development, the same idea has been\r\nattached to the assembly, or union of the great public\r\nassemblies; and they have both been designated by the same word.\r\n\r\nAt both these periods, the Parliament or the corresponding\r\nassembly which preceded it, has never actually been, and, indeed,\r\ncould not be considered as a special power, distinct from the\r\ngovernment properly so called,--an accessory limited in its\r\naction to a certain number of affairs or emergencies. The\r\ngovernment itself has resided in it. All superior powers have\r\nthere been concentrated and called into exercise.\r\n\r\n{449}\r\n\r\n         The Great National Council.\r\n\r\nAt the origin of modern States, and especially of England, it was\r\nvery far from being thought that the whole and sole right of the\r\nbody of capable citizens, of the political nation, consisted in\r\nconsenting to the imposition of taxes; that they were otherwise\r\nsubjected to an independent authority, and were not authorized in\r\nany way to interfere, either directly or indirectly, in the\r\ngeneral affairs of the State. Whatever these affairs might be,\r\nthey were their affairs, and they always occupied themselves with\r\nthem, when their importance naturally called for their\r\nintervention. This is testified by the history of the Saxon\r\n_Wittenagemot_, of the Anglo-Norman _Magnum Consilium_\r\nand of all the national assemblies of the German peoples, in the\r\nearliest period of their existence. These assemblies were truly\r\nthe great national council, deliberating and deciding on the\r\naffairs of the nation in concert with the king.\r\n\r\nWhen the representative system has achieved all its mighty\r\nconquests, and borne its essential fruits, it has invariably\r\nresorted to this; and returned in fact to the point from which it\r\nset out. In spite of all distinctions and apparent limitations,\r\nthe power of Parliament has extended to everything, and has\r\nexercised a more or less immediate, but in reality a decisive\r\ninfluence on all the affairs of the State. Parliament has again\r\nbecome the great national council in which all the national\r\ninterests are debated and regulated, sometimes by means of\r\nanterior deliberation, at other times by those of responsibility.\r\n\r\nWhen this first and last condition of free governments has been\r\nrecognized, it will be perceived that a very different\r\nintermediate condition is to be met with, in which Parliament,\r\nalthough sometimes styled the great national council, exercises\r\nnone of its functions, does not in a permanent manner interfere\r\nin political affairs, and is not, in a word, the seat and\r\nhabitual instrument of government. During the whole of this\r\nperiod, the government is separate from the Parliament, and\r\nresides altogether in the royal power, around which are grouped\r\nthe principal members of the great aristocracy. The Parliament is\r\nnecessary in certain cases, but it is not the centre, the focus,\r\nof political action. It exercises rights, defends its liberties,\r\nand labours for their extension; but influences the government in\r\nno decisive way: and principles which belong only to absolute\r\nmonarchy co-exist with the more or less frequent convocation of\r\nthe representatives of the nation.\r\n\r\n{450}\r\n\r\n          Parliament In The Fourteenth Century.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of the British Parliament, from its formation\r\nin the thirteenth century until nearly the end of the\r\nseventeenth. It was only at the end of the seventeenth century\r\nthat it resumed all the characteristics of a great national\r\ncouncil, and became once more the seat of the entire government.\r\n\r\nThe British Parliament was not, then, in the fourteenth century\r\neither what the public assemblies of the German peoples had\r\noriginally been, nor what it is in the present day. In order\r\nproperly to comprehend what, at that period, was the nature of\r\nits power and the scope of its influence, we must follow the\r\nprogress of events.\r\n\r\nCommon deliberation on common affairs is the principle, as well\r\nas the most simple form, of political liberty. This principle\r\nfully obtained at the infancy of modern nations. The national\r\nassembly was the great council in which public affairs of every\r\nkind were transacted. The king, the natural head of this council,\r\nwas required to convoke it, and to follow its advice.\r\n\r\nBy the dispersion of the nation over an extended territory, the\r\ngreat national council became dispersed, and could not be\r\nassembled: for some time, however, it retained its ancient form,\r\nand the full extent of its ancient rights; but power is attached\r\nto continual presence, and the great council became of rare\r\noccurrence. Its numbers rapidly thinned; and it was very soon\r\ncomposed of great landowners alone, whom wealth, political\r\nimportance, and that ambition which increases with the growth of\r\npower, frequently assembled round the king. The government, which\r\nformerly resided in the great national council, now resided only\r\nin this new council, formed of the king and the great barons, who\r\nbecame daily further separated from the body of the nation. The\r\nsame words continued to be employed: the king always governed\r\nwith his great council; but this was no longer the same assembly;\r\nthe government and the body of the nation had become disjoined.\r\n\r\nThe king endeavoured to free himself from the great barons, and\r\nto govern alone; they resisted; and in the struggle in which they\r\nengaged for the defence of their liberties or the preservation of\r\ntheir influence in the central government, they were compelled to\r\nseek support from the body of the nation, the freeholders and the\r\nburgesses.\r\n\r\n{451}\r\n\r\n              Admission Of The Commons.\r\n\r\nThe issue of this struggle was favourable to liberty; the\r\nfreeholders and the burgesses, who were become almost strangers\r\nto the central government, renewed their connection with it by\r\nthe formation of Parliament; and this great council of the king,\r\nwhich for two centuries had been continually contracting, once\r\nmore began to extend.\r\n\r\nBut at their return, the new citizens were very far from taking\r\nthe same place which their ancestors had occupied. The\r\ndevelopment of inequality is always the first result of the\r\nprogress of the social state. Royalty had extended and fortified\r\nits power; it now existed by itself, powerful and independent,\r\nand claiming distinct rights proportionate to its own strength.\r\nIt was the same with the great barons, who also were strong and\r\nindependent in themselves. If it had been possible to congregate\r\nin a single assembly all the descendants of those ancient Saxons\r\nor Normans who had originally formed the great common council, a\r\nvery different spectacle would have been presented. Instead of\r\nfinding an assembly of warriors, not enjoying perfect equality,\r\ncertainly, but sufficiently equal for each to preserve his\r\npersonal importance, and to consider himself in a condition to\r\ndefend it; instead of seeing a chief at their head, too little\r\ndistinguished from the principal men among them to be powerful\r\nwithout their adherence,--there would have been a king invested\r\nwith great wealth and power, mighty barons followed by a\r\nmultitude of retainers almost entirely dependent upon them, and a\r\nbody of citizens obliged to unite and act collectively for the\r\nrecovery of some influence over those measures which interested\r\nthem most directly. In this new composition of society and of the\r\nnational assembly, the deputies of the counties and boroughs were\r\nvery far from pretending to associate themselves with the\r\ngovernment properly so called, or from thinking to control or\r\ndirect the central power in all public affairs; several centuries\r\nnecessarily elapsed before their ideas could acquire so much\r\ngenerality, and their interference in Parliament became so\r\ncomprehensive. They assembled there for the sole purpose of\r\ndefending themselves, and those whom they represented, against\r\nthe most crying abuses of power, against the violent and\r\narbitrary invasion of their persons and their possessions.\r\n\r\n{452}\r\n\r\n          Vicissitudes Of The Parliament.\r\n\r\nDiscussing the demands for supplies that were addressed to them,\r\nand presenting their complaints to the government against the\r\nmost perilous acts of injustice of the agents of the king or of\r\nthe great nobles, constituted the whole of their mission, and, in\r\ntheir own opinion, the full extent of their rights. Their\r\npersonal importance was too trivial, and their intellectual\r\nactivity too limited, for them to imagine themselves called to\r\ndiscuss and regulate the general affairs of the State. They\r\nresisted power when it directly attacked them, or required great\r\nsacrifices from them; but royalty and its prerogatives, the\r\nordinary council of the king, and his measures in regard to\r\nlegislation, peace and war, or general politics, in a word, the\r\ngovernment properly so called, were entirely beyond their\r\ninterference. They had not the power, or even the wish, to meddle\r\nwith such matters; it was all discussed and decided between the\r\nking, his ministers, and the great nobles who were naturally\r\ncalled to take part therein by the elevation and importance of\r\ntheir social position.\r\n\r\nBoth the ancient assembly of the Saxon or Norman warriors, then,\r\nand the existing Parliament, would be vainly sought for in the\r\nParliament of the fourteenth century. No violence is done to\r\nfacts: a new society had been formed which could only engender a\r\npolitical order in accordance with its own character. Great\r\ninequality prevailed, and this inequality would naturally\r\nreappear between the powers to which it gave birth. The primitive\r\nand simple unity which exists in an uncivilized community had\r\ndisappeared; the wise unity to which a state of civilised society\r\ncan elevate itself by the diffusion of wealth and intelligence,\r\nwas still far distant. There was a king, a House of Lords, and a\r\nHouse of Commons: but there was not a Parliament in the political\r\nsense which is now attached to that word.\r\n\r\nThe permanent co-existence of royalty and a great public council,\r\nthrough all these vicissitudes of government and liberty, is an\r\nimportant fact. This council, formed at first by the general\r\nassembly of the nation, afterwards restricted to the great\r\nbarons, and speedily admitting within its circle the\r\nrepresentatives of other social conditions, has always been in\r\nEngland the principal organ of the central government. The\r\nEnglish monarchy has never succeeded in isolating and\r\nenfranchising itself therefrom.\r\n\r\n{453}\r\n\r\n         Its Gradual Increase.\r\n\r\nIt has been narrowed or extended by reason of changes occurring\r\nin society: but it has always constituted the condition and form\r\nof the monarchy. Popular liberty, so to speak, has always\r\nmaintained a footing in the central power; the nation has never\r\nbeen completely excluded from participation in its own affairs.\r\nThe progress of Parliament has been the progress of the\r\ngovernment itself. In vain was the House of Commons feeble and\r\ninactive at its origin: it did exist, and it formed part of the\r\nking's council; it was always present to embrace, in some\r\nmeasure, every opportunity of extending its influence, and\r\naggrandising its position and the part it had to perform. In the\r\nfourteenth century, its power was very limited, its attributes\r\nvery restricted, and its intervention in public affairs very\r\ninfrequent; but it was impossible that it should not daily\r\nincrease. In effect it did greatly increase from the time of\r\nEdward I. to that of Henry VI. During the wars of the Red and\r\nWhite Roses, the great feudal aristocracy destroyed itself by its\r\ncontentions. When Henry VII. ascended the throne, there no longer\r\nexisted a body of great barons capable of offering armed\r\nresistance to the royal power. The House of Commons, though\r\nstrengthened, had not yet emerged from its condition of\r\ninferiority, and was incapable of taking the place of the great\r\nbarons in resistance to royalty. Hence the Tudor despotism in the\r\nsixteenth century, the only period at which the maxims of\r\nabsolute power have prevailed in England; but even in that very\r\ncentury, the House of Commons daily penetrated further into the\r\ngovernment, until its power was fully revealed by the great\r\nRevolution of the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nI have now given you a glimpse of the space between the period of\r\nthe definitive formation of the British Parliament, and that at\r\nwhich it sought to obtain its entire dominion. In our subsequent\r\nlectures we shall examine the principal phases in the development\r\nof this great government during those three centuries.\r\n\r\n{454}\r\n\r\n              Lecture XX.\r\n\r\n  Condition and attributes of the Parliament during the reign of\r\n  Edward II. (1307-1327).\r\n\r\n  Empire of favourites.\r\n\r\n  Struggle of the barons against the favourites.\r\n\r\n  Aristocratic factions.\r\n\r\n  Petitions to the king.\r\n\r\n  Forms of deliberations on this subject.\r\n\r\n  Deposition of Edward II.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Reign Of Edward I.\r\n\r\nIn order to explain the manner in which the British Parliament\r\nwas formed, I have found it necessary, up to this point, to\r\nfollow history step by step,--to enter into all the details, and\r\nto collect all the facts, that might serve as proofs either of\r\nits existence, or of its participation in public affairs. I have\r\nnow another object to attain, and I must therefore pursue another\r\ncourse. The Parliament is now definitively formed; and if I were\r\nto continue to narrate all the facts which relate to it, and to\r\nkeep a register, as it were, of all its acts, I should write the\r\nhistory of the country, and not that of its institutions. What I\r\nam seeking to describe, is the development of representative\r\ngovernment; and I shall avoid all questions unconnected with this\r\nobject. The extension which the Parliament received, the\r\nrevolutions which it underwent,--in a word, its personal and\r\ninternal life, will constitute the subject to which our attention\r\nmust be directed.\r\n\r\nOn considering the reign of Edward I. from a political point of\r\nview, it is evident that, notwithstanding the agitations by which\r\nit was disturbed, there was, during that reign, some wholeness\r\nand unity in the exercise of power. Edward was a firm and capable\r\nprince, who well knew how to concentrate and direct the various\r\nforces of society; in him, the State possessed a centre and a\r\nchief. Under Edward II., the English government lost all solidity\r\nand unity: no intelligent and determined will presided over it;\r\nthe nation had no rallying-point; the string of the bundle was\r\nbroken; all forces and all passions were displayed at hap-hazard,\r\nand came into conflict upon the interests of individuals or\r\nfactions.\r\n\r\n{455}\r\n\r\n         Empire Of Favourites.\r\n\r\nIn such a state of things, what could the Parliament be? Nothing,\r\nor next to nothing, unless it were an instrument of factions. The\r\nbody of barons was then, and long continued to be, the\r\npreponderant portion of the assembly: the Commons, though strong\r\nenough sometimes to defend themselves when their own interests\r\nwere at stake, were not sufficiently powerful to interfere, in a\r\ndecisive manner, in public affairs, and to become the centre of\r\nthe government. All matters were, therefore, arranged between the\r\ncourt and the barons, or rather between the different factions\r\ninto which the body of barons was divided. The Commons appeared\r\nin the train of one or other party, to give their alternate\r\ntriumphs the appearance of a national adhesion, but without ever\r\ndetermining the course of events, or even modifying them in any\r\neffectual manner. The supreme power and the country were a prey\r\nto the conflicts and schisms of the high aristocracy.\r\n\r\nIn order clearly to demonstrate that such was the state of\r\ninstitutions and of the central government at this period, it\r\nwill be sufficient to refer to the three principal events of this\r\nreign.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Rebellions Of The Barons.\r\n\r\nThe first is the conflict which the English barons maintained\r\nagainst the king, with regard to a favourite, Piers Gaveston,\r\nwhom, in spite of his father's advice, Edward II. had persisted\r\nin retaining in his confidence. The favourite and his creatures\r\nabsorbed all the power and advantages of the court; and in 1311,\r\nthe barons, desiring their share of riches and favours, after\r\nhaving attempted all other means for his overthrow, demanded his\r\ndismissal with arms in their hands. Their enterprise was\r\nevidently intended neither to promote the interests of the people\r\nnor those of the king; it was a revolt of courtiers. They fought,\r\nnot to assert the inviolability of charters or rights, but to\r\nobtain the employments and treasures of a favourite.\r\nNevertheless, they attempted to give a national colour to their\r\nrebellion.\r\n{456}\r\nThe plans and measures of the great rebel Parliament held at\r\nOxford during the reign of Henry III. were revived; Lords\r\nOrdainers were appointed to reform the State; they bid for public\r\nfavour by the abolition of a few abuses; they enacted that the\r\npossessors of landed property alone should be appointed sheriffs;\r\nthey limited the right of purveyance, which was held by the\r\ncrown; and they prohibited all grants of royal letters-patent\r\nordering the suspension of the regular course of justice. But\r\nthese were merely outward appearances intended to conceal the\r\nselfish egotism of the great barons; their only object was to\r\nmake themselves masters of the royal authority, of the right of\r\nappointing to the chief offices of state, and of the revenues of\r\nthe crown. They put Gaveston to death, and seized upon the whole\r\npower. The representatives of counties and boroughs, who were\r\npresent in the Parliament by which these designs were executed,\r\ngave their consent; but they were mere followers of the\r\nrebellion, and had no influence upon the government. The great\r\nbarons, who came to Parliament in arms and accompanied by their\r\ntroops, had the entire management of everything in their own\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nEdward escaped from the tutelage imposed upon him by the\r\ncoalition of the barons, only to fall under the sway of two new\r\nfavourites, Hugh le Despencer, or Spencer, and his son. The\r\nelevation of these two courtiers raised up against them a storm\r\nsimilar to that which had overthrown Gaveston. The new rebellion\r\nwhich broke out in 1321 is the second remarkable event of this\r\nreign. It was first manifested by a sentence passed against the\r\ntwo Spencers by the great barons of the realm. They passed it by\r\ntheir own authority alone, without the concurrence either of the\r\nCommons or of the king, and at the same time compelled the king\r\nto grant them an amnesty for themselves and their adherents;\r\nshortly afterwards, the civil war began, and the confederated\r\nbarons were overcome. Edward convoked a Parliament at York, in\r\n1322, at which the Commons attended, and which repealed first the\r\nsentence against the two Spencers, and afterwards all the\r\nordinances passed by the Lords Ordainers in 1311 and 1312, as\r\nbeing contrary to the rights of the king, and to the laws and\r\nusages of the country. Thus, whether the court or the rebels\r\nprevailed, a Parliament always sanctioned their triumph, saving\r\nonly the ever-ready recourse to civil war, the only true means of\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n{457}\r\n\r\n              Deposition Of Edward II.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is evident that the riches which were amassed by\r\ncourt favours and the exercise of royal power were a constant\r\nsubject of jealousy and faction., The petition presented to the\r\nking in 1322 by Hugh Spencer the elder against the barons who had\r\ncondemned him, sets forth that they had devastated sixty-three of\r\nhis manors or domains in fifteen different counties,--that they\r\nhad carried off 28,000 sheep, 22,000 head of cattle, two\r\nharvests, one from his barns and granaries, and one of standing\r\ncorn, 600 horses, a great quantity of provisions of all kinds,\r\nand complete suits of armour to equip 200 men,--and that they had\r\nmoreover done damage, in his castles and lands, to the amount of\r\nmore than 30,000_l._ sterling. Such was then the wealth of a\r\ngreat English baron; and herein resided an inexhaustible source\r\nof rebellions.\r\n\r\nA third event, the deposition of Edward II., presents a spectacle\r\nof the same character as the two preceding occurrences. This was\r\nthe result of a new confederation of the barons, at whose head\r\nthe queen, Isabella, had placed herself. A Parliament, convoked\r\nat Westminster, on the 7th of January, 1327, declared the\r\nincapacity of the king, then a prisoner in Kenilworth Castle. A\r\ndeputation, composed of four bishops, two earls, four barons,\r\nthree deputies from each county, and several burgesses of London,\r\nof the Cinque Ports, and of other cities, was sent to acquaint\r\nhim with the resolution of the Parliament, and formally to\r\nrenounce the oath of fidelity. This deputation received from\r\nEdward II. his abdication in favour of his son Edward III., then\r\nfourteen years of age, under whose name the dominant faction\r\nexpected to wield the supreme power to its own advantage.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the interference of the Commons in this and the\r\npreceding acts, it is clear that the whole affair was managed\r\nbetween aristocratic factions influenced by personal interests,\r\nand profiting by the king's incapacity to appropriate to\r\nthemselves the government and all its advantages. There is\r\nnothing to indicate any progress of political institutions and\r\ntriumph of national liberties. The government of the barons,\r\nafter such scenes, was even more arbitrary and oppressive than\r\nthat of the king.\r\n\r\n{458}\r\n\r\n         Progress Of The Parliament.\r\n\r\nIt is, nevertheless, a remarkable fact that, in all these\r\noccurrences, the sanction of the Parliament was always regarded\r\nas necessary, and as the only means of terminating and legalizing\r\nthe works of violence. The Parliament, or at least the House of\r\nCommons, was merely a passive instrument in the matter; but it\r\nwas already thought impossible to dispense with its concurrence.\r\nNow, as it is part of the nature of this instrument to serve the\r\ncause of public liberties and to lead, sooner or later, to their\r\nextension, every circumstance that augmented its importance and\r\nestablished its necessity may be considered as a progress of the\r\nrepresentative system.\r\n\r\nI will now bring under your notice the principal parliamentary\r\nfacts of this period, and inquire in what respects the principles\r\nof a free government were manifested or introduced in them.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that the Parliament decidedly became the\r\ncentre towards which all demands for the reform of abuses, the\r\nredressing of grievances, the modification of laws, in a word,\r\nall petitions, were directed; it had possessed this character\r\nfrom its origin, but in a less extended measure. When the\r\nParliament, or rather the body of barons in Parliament assembled,\r\nhad begun once more to act as the great council of the king, a\r\nhost of applications which had previously never been made, or had\r\nbeen addressed to the king alone, were addressed to the king in\r\nParliament, and became a subject for deliberation at its\r\nmeetings. Thus, in the Parliament held at Westminster, in 1315,\r\nwe find that 268 petitions were presented.\r\n\r\nThese petitions were of two kinds. Some were presented by the\r\nCommons to the king in council, and had reference to demands or\r\ncomplaints of general interest. Others were presented by\r\nindividuals, corporations, or towns, and had reference to private\r\nor local interests. The former class gave birth to the right of\r\ninitiative; the latter to the right of petition. Both classes\r\nwere addressed to the king, in whom the actual power resided; and\r\nupon whom, on this account, it devolved not only to provide for\r\nthe general necessities of the State, but also to do justice to\r\nspecial interests.\r\n\r\n{459}\r\n\r\n              Practice Regarding Petitions.\r\n\r\nOn the opening of each Parliament, a certain number of days were\r\nfixed for the reception of petitions. A certain number of\r\npersons, chiefly judges or councillors of the king, were\r\nappointed to receive them, to investigate their nature, to\r\nclassify them according to their objects, to set aside those\r\nwhich were to form the subject of discussion in the Parliament\r\nitself, and finally to present them to Parliament. This\r\ndiscussion was almost confined to the House of Barons, who were\r\nsupposed to form a great intermediary council between the privy\r\ncouncil of the king and the entire Parliament. The barons, when\r\nassembled in the privy council, deliberated and decided upon the\r\ndemands of the Commons relative to matters of general interest.\r\nIf these demands referred to certain complaints against abuses of\r\nthe exercise of the royal power, or against the conduct of the\r\nsheriffs, for example, the king answered them in his own name\r\nalone, after having taking the advice of his privy council, of\r\nthe judges, or of the barons, according to circumstances. If the\r\npetitions prayed for some interpretation or declaration of the\r\nexisting law, the answer was given in the same manner. If they\r\nsuggested the enactment of a new law, the king, when he judged it\r\nconvenient, proposed this law to the Parliament; but in early\r\ntimes, this was very rarely the case; and when the petition had\r\nonce been presented, the Commons ordinarily had nothing further\r\nto do with the matter than to receive the answer of the king.\r\n\r\nAs to those petitions which originated from individuals or from\r\nbodies unconnected with the Parliament, and which related only to\r\nmatters of private interest, the meeting of Parliament was merely\r\nchosen as the occasion of their presentation, because it was more\r\nfavourable than any other period for obtaining a reply. The royal\r\ncouncil decided upon all those petitions which did not require\r\nthe intervention of the barons or of the entire Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe presentation of petitions at this period is, therefore, a\r\nvery complex fact with which are connected not only the right of\r\npetition to the Houses of Parliament, but also the right of\r\npetition to the government generally, the right of initiative,\r\nthe jurisdiction of the Houses of Parliament, in short, a host of\r\ninstitutions essential to the representative system, and each of\r\nwhich it is necessary to consider separately. They all existed,\r\nbut in a confused and embryo state, in this affluence of\r\npetitions of all kinds, which called into action very different\r\npowers, then exercised indiscriminately.\r\n{460}\r\nThis original confusion was, undoubtedly, one of the principal\r\ncauses of the universality of the power of the British\r\nParliament. We cannot now examine into all the institutions which\r\nsprang from this source, and progressively disentangled\r\nthemselves, assuming a distinct form. The question of the right\r\nof petition, in the sense which is attached to it at the present\r\nday, is in itself deserving of our careful examination, and will\r\nform the subject of our next lecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Conditions Of Granting Subsidies.\r\n\r\nOne particular fact attests the progress which the Commons were\r\nbeginning to make in the comprehension of their power and rights.\r\nIt is beyond doubt that, originally, the voting of supplies\r\nalways furnished them with an opportunity of obtaining some\r\nconcessions or the redress of their grievances; this is proved by\r\nthe history of English charters. But, in 1309, when granting\r\nEdward II. a twentieth part of their moveable goods, they\r\nexpressly attached the condition that \"the king should take into\r\nconsideration, and should grant them the redress of certain\r\ngrievances of which they had to complain.\" [Footnote 36]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 36: These grievances were eleven in number, viz:\r\n      1. That the king's purveyors took all kinds of provisions\r\n      without giving any security for the payment;\r\n      2. That additional duties had been imposed on wine, on\r\n      cloth, and on other foreign imports;\r\n      3. That by the debasement of the coin, the value of all\r\n      commodities had been advanced;\r\n      4. That the stewards and marshals of the king's household\r\n      held pleas, which did not fall under their cognizance;\r\n      5. And exercised their authority beyond the verge, that is,\r\n      a circuit of twelve leagues round the king's person;\r\n      6. That no clerks were appointed, as they had been under\r\n      the last monarch, to receive the petitions of the Commons\r\n      in Parliament;\r\n      7. That the officers appointed to take articles for the\r\n      king's use in fairs and markets, took more than they ought,\r\n      and made a profit of the surplus;\r\n      8. That in civil suits, men were prevented from obtaining\r\n      their right by writs under the privy seal;\r\n      9. That felons eluded the punishment of their crimes by the\r\n      ease with which charters of pardon were obtained;\r\n      10. That the constables of the castles held common pleas at\r\n      their gates without any authority; and\r\n      11. That the escheators ousted men of their inheritances,\r\n      though they had appealed to the king's courts.\r\n    _Rot. Parl._ i. 441.]\r\n\r\nThese grievances had existed for a long while, and were\r\nperpetuated for a considerable period afterwards; but the Commons\r\nhad begun to look them full in the face, and to insist year after\r\nyear upon their redress, as the only condition upon which they\r\nwould grant the supplies.\r\n\r\n{461}\r\n         Statute Of 1322.\r\n\r\nA statute passed in 1322, by the Parliament at York, which\r\nrevoked the sentence against the two Spencers, declared that\r\n\"thenceforward all laws respecting the estate of the crown, or of\r\nthe realm and people, must be treated, accorded, and established\r\nin Parliament by the king, by and with the assent of the\r\nprelates, earls, barons, and commonalty of the realm.\" This is a\r\nformal recognition of the right of the Commons to interfere in\r\nthe legislation of the country, and in all great public affairs.\r\n\r\nMany English publicists attach great importance to this statute,\r\nand regard it as the first act which officially sanctioned the\r\nfundamental principle of the British government. This importance\r\nappears to me to be exaggerated. The principle enunciated by this\r\nstatute had been put into practice on many previous occasions,\r\nand a sufficiently clear knowledge was not then possessed of that\r\nwhich constituted matter of legislation and general interest to\r\nobtain conformity to it in practice. It is, therefore, far from\r\nbeing the case that the Commons, from this time forth, always\r\nexercised the power allotted to them by this statute.\r\nNevertheless, the official exposition of the principle indicates\r\nprogress in the ideas ol the times.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Whig And Tory Errors.\r\n\r\nSuch are the principal facts of the reign of Edward II., with\r\nregard to the condition and action of the Parliament. They\r\ncontained no very important innovation, but they announce the\r\nconsolidation and natural progress of the institutions\r\ndefinitively established under Edward I. Tory writers, taking\r\ntheir stand upon the preponderant influence exercised by the\r\ngreat barons during the reign of Edward II., have attempted to\r\ncast doubts even upon the presence of the Commons at several of\r\nthe Parliaments of this period. Whig writers, on their side,\r\nendeavour to deduce, from the proofs which are extant of the\r\npresence of the Commons, an argument for their great importance\r\nand decisive participation in events. The former are mistaken\r\nwhen they deny the presence of the Commons in Parliament, from\r\ntheir having been unable to find any writs of convocation\r\naddressed to the sheriffs; for the writs which order the payment\r\nof the salaries of the representatives are extant for nearly all\r\nthe Parliaments of this period.\r\n{462}\r\nThe latter deduce too extensive results from the presence of the\r\nCommons in the Parliament: it is beyond all doubt that the high\r\naristocracy, who sat in the House of Lords, then managed and\r\ndirected affairs almost entirely alone. The progress of liberty\r\nis not so rapid; the most important point is, that it be certain.\r\nThenceforward it was certain, and it received great development\r\nduring the two following reigns.\r\n\r\n{463}\r\n\r\n              Lecture XXI.\r\n\r\n  Of petitions during the early times of representative\r\n  government.\r\n\r\n  Regulations on the subject.\r\n\r\n  Transformation of the right of petition possessed by the Houses\r\n  of Parliament into the right of proposition and initiative.\r\n\r\n  Petitions ceased to be addressed to the king, and are presented\r\n  to Parliament.\r\n\r\n  Origin of the right of inquiry.\r\n\r\n  Necessity for representative government to be complete.\r\n\r\n  Artifices and abuses engendered by the right of petition.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Right Of Petition.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances which occur at the origin of an institution are\r\nwell calculated to make us acquainted with its nature. At such\r\nperiods, events are simple, and produce themselves spontaneously.\r\nNo effort has yet been made either to evade them or to change\r\ntheir nature, and the state of society is not sufficiently\r\ncomplicated to render it impossible to attain the object aimed at\r\nby any but subtle and indirect means.\r\n\r\nTo say truth, in what does the right of petition consist? It is\r\nthe right to demand the reparation of an injury, or to give\r\nexpression to a desire. Such a demand must naturally be addressed\r\nto the power which is capable of satisfying the desire or\r\nrepairing the injury,--which has authority, and power enough to\r\ngrant the prayer of the petition.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, in the fourteenth century, all petitions, whether\r\nthey emanated from the two Houses of Parliament, or from\r\nindividuals unconnected with those Houses, whether they had\r\nreference to general or private interests, were addressed to the\r\nking. No one had any idea of petitioning the Houses themselves;\r\nthe king governed; in him resided both the right and the power to\r\nredress public or private grievances, and to satisfy the\r\nrequirements of the nation. To him the barons, commons,\r\ncorporations, and citizens applied whenever they had need.\r\n\r\n{464}\r\n         Presentation Of Petitions.\r\n\r\nThe king governed in his council: and of all his councils, the\r\nParliament was the most eminent and the most extensive. In\r\ncertain cases, the advice and acquiescence of the Parliament, as\r\na whole or in part, were necessary to the exercise of the royal\r\nauthority. The meeting of Parliament was, therefore, the natural\r\nopportunity for the presentation of all petitions. It was, as it\r\nwere, the moment at which the nation and the government met face\r\nto face, either to transact in common those affairs which\r\nrequired their concurrence, or to make those reciprocal demands\r\nof which they mutually stood in need. Private citizens naturally\r\navailed themselves of this opportunity for presenting their own\r\npetitions, either because the co-operation of the great powers of\r\nthe State was necessary to grant their prayers, or because they\r\nreferred to demands upon which the king was competent to decide\r\nalone, but to which his attention would then be more effectually\r\ndirected, as they might receive support from the patronage of the\r\nbarons or deputies met in council with the king.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, it was to the king in his council, that is to say,\r\nto the government itself, that petitions were addressed; and far\r\nfrom the Houses of Parliament, after having received and examined\r\nthem, referring them to the government for decision, it was the\r\nking who, by officers specially appointed for the purpose,\r\nreceived and examined them, and afterwards called the attention\r\nof both Houses to those with whose prayers he could not comply\r\nwithout their sanction. All complaints and demands were thus\r\nforwarded directly to the power entrusted with the duty of coming\r\nto a definitive decision regarding them; and the Houses of\r\nParliament interfered subsequently only in certain cases, and\r\nthen as a necessary council.\r\n\r\nSuch was the primitive and natural fact. The progress of the\r\nrepresentative system, however, completely changed its course and\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that, in the fourteenth century, petitions were of\r\ntwo kinds; first, those drawn up or presented to the king, by one\r\nor both Houses, and relating to grievances of a more or less\r\ngeneral character; secondly, those addressed to the king by\r\ncorporations or citizens, and relating to collective or private\r\ninterests. We have now nothing further to do with the first class\r\nof these petitions. As far as the Houses of Parliament are\r\nconcerned, they have become transformed into a right of\r\ninitiative, more or less efficacious and more or less direct.\r\nThis right, its importance and its forms, give rise to questions\r\nof an entirely distinct character. At the present day, the\r\ncomplaints or demands addressed by private citizens to the\r\nlegislative authorities, are alone called by the name of\r\npetitions.\r\n\r\n{465}\r\n\r\n         Assertion Of The Right Of Petition.\r\n\r\nThere is now no further question about the right of addressing\r\nsuch demands to the executive power itself,--to the government\r\nproperly so called. No one thinks of contesting the right of\r\ncitizens to seek in this manner the redress of their grievances,\r\nor the satisfaction of their desires. Nor that this right, in\r\nitself so simple and incontestable, has not sometimes assumed\r\ngreat political importance, and thereby occasioned animated\r\ndiscussions. In 1680, Charles II., having ceased for several\r\nyears to convoke a Parliament, a great number of petitions were\r\naddressed to him demanding its convocation. The king, by\r\nproclamation, declared them seditious, and refused to receive\r\nthem; but the Parliament having met at last, the House of Commons\r\nenacted, on the 27th of October, 1680;\r\n\r\n  \"1. That it is, and ever hath been, the undoubted right of the\r\n  subjects of England to petition the king for the calling and\r\n  sitting of Parliaments, and redressing of grievances.\r\n\r\n  2. That to traduce such petitioning as a violation of duty, and\r\n  to represent it to his Majesty as tumultuous or seditious, is\r\n  to betray the liberty of the subject, and contribute to the\r\n  design of subverting the ancient legal constitution of this\r\n  kingdom, and introducing arbitrary power.\r\n\r\n  3. That a committee be appointed to enquire after all such\r\n  persons, that have offended against the right of the subject.\"\r\n  [Footnote 37]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 37: Parliamentary History, vol. iv. p. 1174.]\r\n\r\nA state of crisis could alone lead to such an attempt to destroy\r\nthe most natural of the right of citizens--the right of\r\naddressing the government itself in order to make known to it\r\ntheir desires--and the Charter, reasonably, neither sanctioned\r\nnor limited it. The right to which it gave sanction, and which\r\nalone now bears the name of the _right of petition_, is the\r\nright of applying to the two Houses of Parliament to urge their\r\ninterference, either in some matter of general legislation, or\r\nfor the redress of private grievances. To this right the question\r\nwhich we have now under consideration is restricted. We must\r\nenquire how it became introduced into the representative system\r\nof government, and in what respects the various forms which it\r\nhas successively assumed correspond to the various stages of the\r\ndevelopment of that system.\r\n\r\n{466}\r\n\r\n         Petitions To Parliament.\r\n\r\nIn fact, this right did not exist in the fourteenth century; that\r\nis to say, nobody thought either of exercising or of demanding\r\nit. The Houses of Parliament, and particularly the House of\r\nCommons, were themselves the great public petitioner. They had\r\nquite enough to do to present and obtain the reception of their\r\nown demands, without incurring the labour of interfering on\r\nbehalf of private interests, which at that time were treated\r\ngenerally with much less consideration. They were, moreover, too\r\nslightly connected with the government thus to meddle with the\r\ndetails of its action. They were neither the seat nor the centre\r\nof power. Their assembly lasted only for a short period. The\r\nking's answers to their own demands were ordinarily given only\r\nduring the next session. In such a state of things, it was\r\nnatural that all private petitions should go directly to the king\r\nin council, for from that source alone could redress be expected.\r\n\r\nWhen the Houses had acquired greater importance, sat for a longer\r\nperiod, and interfered in all great public affairs--when, in\r\nfull and secure possession of their fundamental rights, they\r\nbegan to apply them to practice instead of limiting their efforts\r\nto defend their existence--when, in a word, they had acquired, in\r\npublic opinion and in reality, the consistency of public powers\r\nassociated in the government of the State, it became natural that\r\npetitions should be presented to them against the abuses or\r\nerrors of that government which they were appointed to control.\r\nThe right of petition to the Houses of Parliament was then\r\nregarded as a natural consequence of the right of petition to the\r\nking. The Parliament was always considered and called the great\r\ncouncil of the king. This council, it is true, was habitually in\r\nopposition and conflict with the government of the king, which\r\nstill remained exterior to it, and endeavoured to free itself\r\nfrom its control: but ancient traditions retained their sway;\r\ncomplaint was made to one part of the government against the\r\ninjuries committed by the other part. The new mode of petitioning\r\ndid not, therefore, appear extraordinary, and no attempt was made\r\neither to authorize or prohibit it. It was brought into use\r\nwithout opposition. [Footnote 38]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 38:  Mr. Hallam is of opinion that the interference\r\n    of the Commons in regard to petitions relating to matters of\r\n    private interest originated solely in this desire to repress\r\n    the encroachments of the Privy Council.\r\n      \"From the first years of Henry V.,\" he says, \"though not, I\r\n      think, earlier, the Commons began to concern themselves\r\n      with the petitions of individuals to the Lords or Council.\r\n      ... Many of the requests preferred to them were such as\r\n      could not be granted without transcending the boundaries of\r\n      law. A just inquietude as to the encroachments of the\r\n      king's council had long been manifested by the Commons: and\r\n      finding remonstrances ineffectual, they took measures for\r\n      preventing such usurpations of legislative power, by\r\n      introducing their own consent to private petitions. These\r\n      were now presented by the hands of the Commons, and in very\r\n      many instances passed in the form of statutes with the\r\n      express assent of all parts of the legislature. Such was\r\n      the origin of private bills, which occupy the greater part\r\n      of the rolls in Henry V. and VI.'s Parliament.\"\r\n    (Hallam's Middle Ages, vol. ii. p. 224.)\r\n\r\n    Beginning from the reign of Edward III. (1322), or, as Mr.\r\n    Hallam thinks, from that of Edward II. (1310), we find both\r\n    Houses, at the opening of the session, each appoint a\r\n    committee for the purpose, not only of receiving, but of\r\n    examining petitions, in order to enquire into the truth of\r\n    the facts stated, before the petitions became the subject of\r\n    deliberation in Parliament. (Parliamentary History, vol. i.\r\n    p. 230.) It is doubtful whether the committees received\r\n    directly the petitions addressed to the king in council, or\r\n    whether those which fell under the cognizance of the\r\n    Parliament were referred to them by the officers of the king.\r\n    In 1410, we meet with an instance of a private petition,\r\n    addressed to the Commons, and transmitted by them to the\r\n    king, with their recommendation. (Report of the Lords\r\n    Commissioners, p. 362.) For the mode of the presentation of\r\n    petitions, both to the Privy Council, and to the House of\r\n    Lords, see Hallam's dissertation on the Privy Council, in the\r\n    second volume of his History of the Middle Ages.]\r\n\r\n{467}\r\n         Right Of Initiative.\r\n\r\nBut when this practice was introduced, the Houses of Parliament\r\nthemselves had undergone great change of form, and received\r\nconsiderable development, as regarded their internal\r\nconstitution, their proceedings, and their privileges. Instead of\r\nthose petitions which, at the outset, they had been accustomed to\r\npresent to the king, the right of initiative had been\r\nsubstituted, and this right belonged to every member of either of\r\nthe two Houses of Parliament who might exercise it by bringing\r\nforward, with such formalities and delays as were required by\r\nusage, any motion with which he thought it fitting to occupy the\r\nassembly.\r\n\r\n{468}\r\n         Mode Of Presenting Petitions.\r\n\r\nWith the right of initiative was connected the right of enquiry\r\ninto all such facts or acts as appeared to the House of\r\nsufficient importance to induce it to desire a thorough knowledge\r\nof them, and afterwards to adopt a resolution regarding them,\r\neither of prosecution or of censure, or simply to declare its\r\nopinion. On coming before Houses invested with such rights,\r\npetitions necessarily took another course than would have been\r\nthe case had those rights been wanting. And in the first place,\r\nit passed into a custom that they must be presented by a member;\r\nthis custom was not, originally, a precaution against the abuse\r\nof the right of petition, but the natural form of its exercise.\r\nAs every member enjoyed the right to call the attention of the\r\nHouse, by motion, to any particular subject, it was natural that\r\nhe should make use of this right whenever he became the exponent,\r\nto the House, of the demands of his constituents or his friends.\r\nBy this means, they acquired an authority which they could not\r\notherwise have obtained; the House was thus made to deliberate,\r\nnot upon the petition, but upon the motion of the member who had\r\npresented it, and who had based upon it a proposition either for\r\nan enquiry, or for an address, or for a prosecution, or for a\r\nlaw, or for any other act which the House was entitled to\r\naccomplish. And whatever this motion might be, it was subjected\r\nto all the formalities and all the delays which, on every\r\noccasion, regulated the debates and deliberations of the\r\nassembly.\r\n\r\nThus invested with all the rights necessary for exercising over\r\nthe government, by one mode or another, the influence which\r\nproperly belonged to them, the English Houses of Parliament\r\nregarded the petitions which were presented to them merely as an\r\nopportunity for exercising this influence in virtue of these\r\nrights. They did not act as a sort of patron placed between the\r\npetitioners and the government from which the redress of the\r\ngrievance was definitively demanded; nor did they refer the\r\npetition to the government, with a postscript of their own to\r\nrequest the passing of any act of which they were unable to\r\nsuperintend or compel the execution. After its presentation, they\r\nno longer had anything whatever to do with the petition; if the\r\nmotion to which it had given rise were adopted, then began an act\r\nof the House itself, accomplished with all the usual formalities,\r\nand terminated by a resolution which specially belonged to it,\r\nand which placed the government in presence of the\r\nthoroughly-discussed and clearly-expressed opinion or will of the\r\nassembly which shared with it in the exercise of the supreme\r\npower in the nation.\r\n\r\n{469}\r\n\r\n         Course Of The Right Of Petition.\r\n\r\nWhen, by a further progress, the government found itself at last\r\nobliged to fix its seat within the Houses of Parliament, when\r\nthey had become once more the great national council, discussing\r\nand deciding public affairs in public, petitions also were\r\nrestored to their natural state, to their primary\r\ncondition,--that is to say, being addressed to the Houses of\r\nParliament, they were addressed to the king in council, to the\r\ngovernment itself, which consisted in the royal power, surrounded\r\nby the parliamentary majority, and compelled to justify its\r\nwishes and acts against the attacks of the opposition, which sat\r\nin the same council, by virtue of the same title, and with the\r\nsame rights. What has been the consequence of this? Every\r\npetition, when converted into a motion by a member of the House,\r\ngives rise to a regular combat, conducted according to the usual\r\nformalities, between the ministry and the opposition. The issue\r\nof this conflict fully decides the fate of the petition, that is\r\nto say, the result at which it aims; it has not to go elsewhere\r\nin search of a solution; the House has neither compromised itself\r\nfrivolously, nor given its verdict inconsiderately; and, with the\r\nexception of the case of appeal to a new House after a\r\ndissolution, all its acts, after having been accomplished in\r\nobedience to those formalities which give pledge of their\r\nmaturity, directly attain their object.\r\n\r\nSuch has been the course of the right of petition in England.\r\nClosely connected with the whole system of representative\r\ngovernment, it has kept pace with the progress of that system,\r\nadapting itself to its various successive stages, and holding the\r\nsame rank with the other rights of deliberative assemblies. It\r\nhas thus been brought back to its true nature, which is\r\nincessantly to proclaim and assert, in the centre of the\r\ngovernment itself, the grievances and the requirements of\r\ncitizens, so as to ensure, after mature deliberation, the redress\r\nof the former and the satisfaction of the latter.\r\n\r\n{470}\r\n\r\n         Abuses Of The Right Of Petition.\r\n\r\nI do not say that this result is always attained in England;\r\nother causes have, in certain respects, neutralized the natural\r\nvirtue of representative government, and prevented it from\r\nproducing all its legitimate results. I merely say that the right\r\nof petition has there assumed its reasonable form, and that, but\r\nfor the action of causes which effect a general change of the\r\nsystem, it would by that form attain the object which its\r\nadvocates should propose to themselves.\r\n\r\nLet us now enquire what must happen in a different state of\r\nthings, when representative government, though perhaps less\r\nchanged in certain particulars, is nevertheless much more\r\nincomplete. It will be seen how the right of petition may\r\nintroduce disorder among the public powers of a State, and yet\r\nremain almost illusory.\r\n\r\nThis is the hypothesis upon which I stand. I suppose the Houses\r\nof Parliament invested, by right, with great power, associated in\r\nthe legislation of the country, voting taxes, receiving accounts\r\nof the administration of the revenues of the State, carrying on\r\ntheir discussions in public, and enjoying a large amount of\r\nliberty in these debates. It is beyond a doubt that, in the\r\npublic opinion, they will be held to possess the mission and the\r\npower to obtain the redress of all grievances, and the\r\nsatisfaction of all legitimate requirements, and to compel the\r\nexecutive power to act, on all occasions, in accordance with\r\njustice, the laws, and the general interests of the country. It\r\nis from the action of the Houses of Parliament that the public\r\nand the citizens will expect all that they desire or hope; and\r\ntowards them they will turn their eyes to obtain it.\r\n\r\nSuch being the disposition of the public mind, if these same\r\nHouses do not possess the right of initiative, or the right of\r\nenquiry, or any positive external jurisdiction--if it is not in\r\ntheir power to set themselves in motion and to pursue their own\r\nobjects--in a word, if their means of direct action are far below\r\ntheir written mission and the public expectation, what will be\r\nthe consequence?\r\n\r\nEvidently both the Houses and the public will seek for indirect\r\nmeans of exercising that influence which rightfully belongs to\r\nthem, and which is actually imputed to them. And if the right of\r\npetition had been solemnly sanctioned, to it will resort be made\r\nto supply the place of deficient rights, and by it will members\r\nof the Houses strive to obtain that control over the whole\r\ngovernment, of which it has been attempted to deprive them.\r\n\r\n{471}\r\n\r\nWho cannot perceive, for example, that the right of petition is a\r\nreal right of initiative, since its effect is to introduce, into\r\nthe Houses of Parliament, questions which the government has not\r\nbrought forward, and to give rise to discussions which the\r\ngovernment has not originated? Thus, the right of initiative,\r\nthough denied to members of the Houses, belongs to all citizens,\r\nto the first comer, even to a fictitious name. The elect of a\r\nlarge number of citizens may not provoke his colleagues to\r\ndiscuss with him a solemnly propounded question: but if he leave\r\nthe House, if he cast aside his character of representative and\r\nassume that of petitioner, he has the power to do so, and the\r\nhumblest citizen possesses it equally with himself. Thus, instead\r\nof an initiative, the utility and propriety of which would be\r\nguaranteed by the character and position of the members of the\r\nHouses, an initiative is substituted which is guarded by no\r\nguarantee, and which imposes no moral obligation upon the man who\r\nexercises it, since he is not a part of the public power which he\r\nsets in motion.\r\n\r\nAnd as this power holds a very lofty position in the public\r\nopinion, as it is supposed to possess the mission and the power\r\nto remedy every evil, its interference will be solicited in\r\nmatters of all kinds; it will be called upon to deliberate upon\r\naffairs most foreign to its attributes; and its petitioners will\r\nafterwards be astonished to find its actual power so limited in\r\ncomparison with the immensity of the rights which it is supposed\r\nto enjoy.\r\n\r\nIt will soon be felt that there is disorder in such a state of\r\nthings, and attempts will be made to remedy it. Restrictions will\r\nbe imposed, if possible, upon this universal initiative. The\r\nremedy would present itself spontaneously, if every member of the\r\nlegislative assemblies had the right to propose such motions as\r\nhe judged fitting. It would then come to pass, as it did in\r\nEngland, that every petition must be presented by a member, and\r\nmust become, on his part, the subject of a motion. Thus the\r\nmembers themselves would exercise over petitions that kind of\r\ncensorship from which it is impossible to liberate them.\r\n{472}\r\nIn the absence of this censorship, another kind is invented; the\r\npetitions are referred to a committee _ad hoc_, appointed to\r\nexamine them beforehand, and to call the attention of the House\r\nto those which appear to deserve its notice; but to whom does\r\nthis censorship belong? to the parliamentary majority which names\r\nthe committee. This is the reverse of the natural order of\r\nthings. Petitions almost always belong to the minority. The\r\nminority presents and supports them. The minority is,\r\nconsequently, placed, in this respect, at the discretion of the\r\nmajority, whose censorship may become a means of tyranny;\r\nwhereas, if the right of initiative belonged to all the members,\r\na legitimate censorship would be established, which would refuse\r\nto bring forward a multitude of unsuitable petitions, and would\r\nneither reject nor postpone any of those which were possessed of\r\nreal importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Discussion Of Petitions.\r\n\r\nAfter the first step in the exercise of the right, that is to\r\nsay, after the presentation of petitions, comes their discussion.\r\nIf they could be introduced by a member only, this discussion\r\nwould be subject to all the delays and formalities required for\r\nthe due regulation of legislative debates. A first motion, for\r\ninstance, would suggest that the petition should be read; a\r\nsecond, that it be printed; a third, that it form the subject of\r\nan enquiry, or of an address to the crown, or of a law. During\r\nthis process, facts would be cleared up, and opinions would be\r\nformed; and a conflict would occur between the minority and the\r\nmajority, only if the latter should formally refuse to grant the\r\njustice demanded, or to comply with the wish expressed. In the\r\nother system, on the contrary, the debate must be precipitate and\r\nconfused; the House and the government must adopt their\r\nresolution in a few moments, often without thoroughly\r\nunderstanding what they demand of, or refuse to, one another.\r\nPetitions succeed and fall upon one another with a rapidity that\r\nproduces sometimes violence, and sometimes indifference; and the\r\nright of petition itself thus becomes an occasion of disorder, or\r\nis treated with a sort of levity and disdain which compromises it\r\nin the legislative chambers, and also compromises the Chambers in\r\nthe opinion of the public.\r\n\r\n{473}\r\n              Right Of Enquiry.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which petitions are introduced into the Chambers is\r\nnot the only cause of so vicious a mode of deliberation, but the\r\nabsence of the right of enquiry also contributes greatly towards\r\nit. Every petition received by one of the Chambers calls for a\r\nresolution on its part; there is therefore something more than\r\nmere singularity in depriving it of the means of adopting that\r\nresolution with a full knowledge of the cause. It is a great\r\ndefect of representative government that, leading as it\r\nnecessarily does to the systematic organization and permanent\r\nconflict of parties, it habitually divides the truth into two\r\nparts, and induces men never to consider questions on more than\r\none side, and to see only half the ideas or facts in reliance\r\nupon which their decision must be made. It is, without doubt, a\r\nsystem of exaggeration and partiality; and this evil is, to a\r\ncertain point, inevitable. All means of diminishing it are,\r\ntherefore, of great importance. Now, the most effectual,\r\nindisputably, is to compel opposing opinions to unite, on certain\r\noccasions, in a common search after truth. This is the effect of\r\nthe right of enquiry. When these opinions reach the moment of\r\ndecision, without having been brought into contact or made\r\nacquainted with each other, without having been constrained\r\nmutually to communicate motives and facts, their resolution will\r\nchiefly be dictated by party spirit, and by anterior engagements\r\nwhich have experienced no necessity to modify it. Everything, on\r\nthe other hand, that brings the minority and the majority into\r\npresence, before the moment when they must appear in public and\r\npronounce their decision, draws them for a time out of their\r\nhabitual sphere, and leads them to extend or to correct their\r\nideas. This is especially the case in reference to facts. It is\r\nimmensely inconvenient if all communications of this kind can\r\nonly be made at the rostrum, and in the midst of the decisive\r\ncombat; for they are then rejected, and scarcely ever influence\r\nthe decision. Thus, as the absence of the right of enquiry leaves\r\nparties in their natural ignorance and primitive crudity, it is\r\ninjurious not only to the goodness of the special resolutions of\r\ndeliberative assemblies, but also to the wisdom of their general\r\narrangements.\r\n\r\nBesides, when the right of enquiry is wanting, its absence is\r\nsupplied in the same way as that of the right of initiative by\r\nthe right of petition. As it is impossible to undertake a serious\r\nand complete investigation of any particular kind of abuse which\r\nappears to have introduced itself into the government, special\r\ncomplaints are suggested and multiplied.\r\n{474}\r\nNow, the right of petition is no more competent to supply the\r\nplace of the right of enquiry than that of the right of\r\ninitiative. The revelation of abuses or grievances which it\r\noccasions is, by the very nature of things, full of confusion and\r\nerror; matters are seldom presented without prejudice and with\r\ngenerality. And yet, from the very fact that there are no means\r\nof going into the details, and examining them in all their\r\nbearings, men are involuntarily led to put confidence in these\r\ncomplaints. Never were the demands presented by the House of\r\nCommons itself for the redress of grievances so numerous and\r\nviolent as in those times when it was allowed to address them to\r\nthe king only, and was permitted neither to have them thoroughly\r\ninvestigated by its own members, nor to sum them up in a body of\r\nfacts accompanied by satisfactory proofs.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Necessity For The Completeness\r\n\t Of Representative Government.\r\n\r\nFinally, when the representative system of government is\r\ncomplete, and provided with all the rights and all the means of\r\naction which it needs in order to accomplish its ends, the right\r\nof petition is nothing but the right of calling the attention of\r\nthe Houses of Parliament, by means of one of their members, to\r\nany particular question, or act of the governing power. When once\r\nthis first provocation has taken place by way of petition, the\r\npetition has attained its object; nothing more is necessary but a\r\ndiscussion and resolution of the House itself, which takes place\r\naccording to the ordinary formalities, as if it had originated\r\nwithin the assembly itself, and independently of all relations\r\nwith the external world. Thus the exercise of a right which\r\nshould belong to all citizens is reconciled with the dignity of\r\nthe public power of the nation, and with the maturity befitting\r\ntheir acts. Thus all grievances may solicit redress, all desires\r\nmay be expressed, without giving rise to any disorder, any\r\nprecipitation, or any subversion of the procedure of the great\r\ndeliberative bodies. When, on the contrary, these deliberative\r\nbodies themselves are deprived of the rights and means of action\r\nwhich are necessary to them for the fulfilment of their\r\ndestination, the right of petition becomes an irregular and often\r\nviolent means by which the public and the legislative chambers\r\nendeavour to supply their deficiencies. And then this right, by\r\nall the practices to which it lends itself, and by the vicious\r\nmode of deliberation which it entails, creates, in its turn, new\r\ndisorders which men undertake to remedy by imposing upon the\r\nright itself restrictions or trammels which would be completely\r\nuseless if the legislative chambers were invested with all the\r\nmeans of action which are their due.\r\n{475}\r\nPolitical liberty has this in common with science generally; it\r\nis most dangerous when it is incomplete. The history of the\r\nBritish Parliament proves this at every step.\r\n\r\n{476}\r\n\r\n                   Lecture XXII.\r\n\r\n  Condition of the Parliament under Edward III.\r\n\r\n  Progress of the power of the Commons.\r\n\r\n  Their resistance to the king.\r\n\r\n  Regularity of the convocation of Parliament.\r\n\r\n  Measures taken for the security of its deliberations.\r\n\r\n  Division of the Parliament into two Houses.\r\n\r\n  Speaker of the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n  Firmness of the House of Commons in maintaining its right to\r\n  grant taxes.\r\n\r\n  Accounts given by the government of the collection of the\r\n  taxes.\r\n\r\n  Appropriation of the funds granted by Parliament.\r\n\r\n  Parliamentary legislation.\r\n\r\n  Difference between statutes and ordinances.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Reign Of Edward III.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have only met with political struggles between the\r\nking and his barons, or between opposite aristocratic factions;\r\nthe Commons have hitherto appeared only in a second rank; they\r\nexercised as yet hardly any direct influence over general\r\naffairs, over the government properly so called; or if they\r\noccasionally interfered in the administration of the country, it\r\nwas merely as the auxiliary or the instrument of some particular\r\nfaction.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Edward III. presents a different aspect; the\r\nconflict between the king and his barons has ceased, and all the\r\ngreat aristocracy seems to be grouped around the throne; but at\r\nthe same time, the Commons have formed themselves into a body,\r\ndistinct and powerful in itself. They do not aspire to snatch the\r\nsupreme power from the hands of the king and the barons; they\r\nwould not have strength enough to do so, nor do they entertain\r\nany thought of it; but they resist every encroachment upon those\r\nrights which they are beginning to know and to appreciate; they\r\nhave acquired a consciousness of their own importance, and know\r\nthat all public affairs properly fall under their cognizance.\r\nFinally, either by their petitions, or by their debates in\r\nreference to taxation, they are daily obtaining a larger share in\r\nthe government, exercise control over affairs which, fifty years\r\nbefore, they never heard mentioned, and become, in a word, an\r\nintegral and almost indispensable part of the great national\r\ncouncil, and of the entire political machine.\r\n\r\n{477}\r\n\r\n         Influence Of The Commons.\r\n\r\nThus, whereas hitherto the political aspect of England has been\r\nthe conflict of the great barons with the king; from the reign of\r\nEdward III., the resistance of the Commons to the king's\r\ngovernment, generally formed and sustained by the barons, becomes\r\nthe great fact of the history. It is not unintentionally that I\r\nhere employ the words _conflict_ and _resistance_. In\r\nthe first period, in fact, the barons struggled, not only to\r\ndefend their rights, but to invade the supreme power, and to\r\nimpose their own government upon the king. This conflict was\r\nconsequently nothing but a permanent civil war. But during the\r\nsecond period, this was no longer the case; we hear of no\r\nrevolts, and of no civil wars: under Edward III., at least, the\r\nCommons do not arm to attack the government with force; but they\r\noppose to it a political resistance, they constantly protest\r\nagainst the abuses and arbitrariness of the central power.\r\nInstead of directing their attacks against the king himself, they\r\nlay all blame upon his ministers, and begin to assert and\r\npopularize the principles of parliamentary responsibility.\r\nFinally, they separate completely from the great barons, act on\r\ntheir own account, and become the true depositaries of the\r\npledges of public liberties.\r\n\r\nThis was a great revolution, and it prepared the way for all\r\nothers. The more minutely we examine into the events of the reign\r\nof Edward III., the more proofs shall we discover of this\r\nimportant change. I shall content myself with giving a rapid\r\nsummary of these proofs by recapitulating the general facts which\r\ncharacterize this reign.\r\n\r\nThe first of these facts is the regularity, previously\r\nunexampled, with which the Parliament was convoked. A measure was\r\nadopted for this purpose in 1312, during the reign of Edward II.,\r\nby the Lords Ordainers. Subsequently we meet with two statutes\r\nrelative to the convocation of this assembly, one of which was\r\npassed in 1331, and the other in 1362. Finally, in 1377, the last\r\nyear of the reign of Edward III., the Commons themselves demanded\r\nby petition that the sessions of Parliament should take place\r\nregularly every year. It is curious to compare this petition with\r\nthe requests addressed to the king, under previous reigns, by the\r\nmembers of the House of Commons, to be exempted from serving in\r\nParliament: they had now begun to feel that their mission was not\r\na burden, but a right.\r\n\r\n{478}\r\n\r\n         Parliaments Of Edward III.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Edward III., we may enumerate forty-eight\r\nsessions of Parliament, which makes nearly one session in each\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nNor did the Parliament merely provide for the regularity of its\r\nconvocation; it took measures, at the same time, to ensure the\r\nsecurity of its deliberations. In 1332, a royal proclamation\r\nforbade all persons to wear coats of mail, or to carry any other\r\noffensive or defensive arms, in those towns in which the\r\nParliament was sitting: it also prohibited all games and\r\ndiversions which might disturb the deliberations of the assembly.\r\nThe frequent recurrence of proclamations of this kind announces\r\nthe formation of a regular assembly.\r\n\r\nIt is also during the reign of Edward III., in 1313, that we hear\r\nfor the first time of the Parliament being divided into two\r\nHouses. According to historical documents of that year, the\r\nprelates, counts and barons, on the one hand, and the\r\nrepresentatives of the counties and boroughs, on the other, sat\r\nat Westminster, the former in the White Chamber, and the latter\r\nin the Painted Chamber; and deliberated thus upon the question of\r\npeace with France.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is also at the end of this reign, in 1377, that the\r\nrolls of Parliament first make mention of the Speaker of the\r\nHouse of Commons; Sir Thomas Hungerford is the first person upon\r\nwhom this title was conferred. Previously, the House used to\r\nselect one of its members whenever it was necessary to speak in\r\nits name, either to the king, or in the full Parliament: and it\r\nwas probably in 1377, that it began to appoint its Speaker for\r\nthe whole session, and at its commencement.\r\n\r\n{479}\r\n\r\n         Prorogations Of Parliament.\r\n\r\nIt has been asserted that, during this reign and in earlier\r\ntimes, every session of Parliament involved a fresh election; and\r\nthat the right of proroguing the existing Parliament to a new\r\nsession did not appertain to the king. This is an error. It was\r\nnecessary that a session of Parliament should take place in each\r\nyear, but not an election. The following fact proves this. The\r\nParliament held under Edward I. in 1300, resumed its session in\r\n1301. The writs summon the deputies of the previous year, except\r\nin cases in which a new election was necessary on account of\r\ndeath or absolute inability to serve. In 1305, the king prorogued\r\nParliament on the 21st of March, and allowed the deputies to\r\nreturn home, \"_Issint qu'ils reveignent prestement et sanz\r\ndélai, quele houre qu'ils soient autrefois remandez._\"--\"On\r\ncondition that they should return readily and without delay, at\r\nsuch time as they might be previously recalled.\" In 1312, during\r\nthe reign of Edward II., the Parliament separated after having\r\nsat two months, and on the same day the king addressed writs to\r\nthe sheriffs, ordering them to send \"the same knights and\r\nburgesses--_eosdem milites et cives_,\" to Westminster on the\r\n2nd of November following, \"to the same Parliament which we have\r\nthought should be continued there--_ad idem Parliamentum quod\r\nibidem duximus continuandum_.\" This Parliament thus prorogued\r\nactually met, and sat from the 2nd of November to the 18th of\r\nDecember, after which it was dissolved. In 1329, during the reign\r\nof Edward III., the Parliament which sat at Salisbury, from the\r\n15th to the 31st of October, was adjourned to Westminster, where\r\nit held a second session, from the 10th to the 22nd of February,\r\n1330. We meet with similar instances in 1333 and 1372. The\r\nParliaments were, therefore, not elected annually, and the right\r\nof prorogation was in full vigour.\r\n\r\nThus was developed and regulated the internal constitution of the\r\nParliament: thus, instead of being merely an accidental meeting,\r\nlimited to the accomplishment of a single object, it gradually\r\nassumed the consistency of a political assembly of periodical\r\nobligation.\r\n\r\n{480}\r\n         Voting Of Taxes.\r\n\r\nA second general fact, which serves to support the views which I\r\nhave advanced, is the voting of taxes. There is, perhaps no reign\r\nwhich presents so many instances of arbitrary and illegal imposts\r\nas that of Edward III., and yet there is not one which\r\ncontributed more powerfully to secure the triumph of the\r\nprinciple that taxes are legitimate only when they are freely\r\ngranted. This principle was incessantly lost sight of practically\r\nby the king, who was pressed by necessities, created partly by\r\nhis wars, and partly by the bad administration of his revenues.\r\nHis whole reign was spent in efforts to regain, under forms more\r\nor less indirect, the right of taxing his subjects at his\r\npleasure; but the Commons, on their side, never ceased to protest\r\nagainst these efforts, sometimes attaching the revocation of an\r\narbitrary tax to the concession of a legal subsidy, and sometimes\r\nby endeavouring to introduce the principle of the necessity of\r\nconsent into all those ways by which the king attempted to elude\r\nit. Thanks to their perseverance, the schemes of power were, if\r\nnot always frustrated, at least always unmasked, and thereby\r\nrendered impotent for the future.\r\n\r\nInstances of this conflict abound in the Parliaments held in the\r\nyears 1333, 1340, 1347, 1348, and 1349, which are in general\r\nfilled only with complaints of the Commons, demanding either the\r\nabolition or the diminution of unjust and illegal taxes, which\r\nhad been imposed without their consent. To all these demands the\r\nking replied, sometimes by a formal refusal, sometimes by\r\nreference to the consent which had been granted him by the Lords,\r\nand sometimes by an assurance that the tax should not be levied\r\nfor any length of time; but if the Commons threatened to refuse\r\nhim new subsidies, he felt himself compelled to meet these\r\ndemands by some new concessions.\r\n\r\nNor was it merely by keeping a firm hand upon the voting of taxes\r\nthat the House of Commons maintained its rights; it also extended\r\nthem beyond the concession of subsidies on two important\r\noccasions. In 1340, the Parliament, suspecting that a portion of\r\nthe subsidies voted by it had not found its way into the royal\r\nexchequer, appointed certain persons to receive the accounts of\r\nthe tax-collectors, and required them to give security for the\r\npayment of all that they received. This is the first instance of\r\nany account whatever being given to Parliament with regard to\r\ntaxes; it began by desiring to make sure of the fidelity of the\r\nreceipts, and thus took a first step towards asserting its rights\r\nto receive an account of the employment of the funds, that is to\r\nsay, of their expenditure. In 1354, we perceive the dawn of\r\nanother parliamentary right, that of the appropriation of the\r\npublic funds. The Parliament, when granting a tax upon wool,\r\nadded to its vote the condition that the money derived from this\r\nsubsidy should be devoted to the expenses of the war then waging,\r\nand not to any other purpose.\r\n\r\n{481}\r\n\r\n         Share In The Legislation.\r\n\r\nAfter all, it is not to be wondered at that the king and his\r\nParliament were incessantly at variance with regard to subsidies,\r\nand mutually occasioned each other continual miscounts. There was\r\nthen no means of estimating receipts and expenditure beforehand.\r\nThe king involved himself in an expense without knowing to what\r\nsum it would amount; and the Parliament voted a subsidy without\r\nknowing what it would produce. In 1371, the Parliament granted a\r\nsubsidy of £50,000, to be levied at the rate of 22_s_.\r\n3_d_. on every parish, which supposed the existence of\r\n45,000 parishes in England. It turned out, however, that there\r\nwere only 9,000. The king convoked a great council, to which he\r\nsummoned only half the deputies of the last Parliament, one from\r\neach county and borough, \"to save expense--_ad parcendum\r\nsumptibus._\" The matter was laid before this council, which\r\nordained the assessment of every parish at 116_s_. instead\r\nof at 22s. 3d., in order to raise the sum of £50,000. Great\r\ndisorder must necessarily have accompanied such ignorance.\r\n\r\nThe third general fact which proves the great increase of\r\nimportance which the Parliament had obtained at this period, is\r\nits participation in the legislation. When we open a collection\r\nof the statutes of this reign, we find at the head of each\r\nstatute one of the two following formulas: _\"A la requeste de\r\nla commune de son roïalme par lor pétitions mises devant lui et\r\nson conseil, par assent des prélats, comtes, barons, et autres\r\ngrantz, au dit Parlement assembles_,\" &c. [Footnote 39] Or:\r\n\"_Par assent des prélats, comtes, et barons, et de tote la,\r\ncommune du roïalme, au dit Parlement assembles_,\" &c.\r\n[Footnote 40] Sometimes the statute begins with these words:\r\n\"_Ce sont les choses que notre seigneur le roi, les prélats,\r\nseignours, et la commune ont ordiné en ce présent Parlement_.\"\r\n[Footnote 41]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 39: \"At the request of the commons of his realm, by\r\n    their petitions! laid before him and his council, and by the\r\n    assent of the prelates, earls, barons, and other nobles, in\r\n    the said Parliament assembled.\"]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 40: \"By the assent of the prelates, earls and barons,\r\n    and of all the commons of the realm, in the said Parliament\r\n    assembled.\"]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 41: \"These are the things which our lord the king,\r\n    the prelates, lords, and commons have ordained in this\r\n    present Parliament.\"]\r\n\r\n{482}\r\n         Ordnances And Statutes.\r\n\r\nAll these formulas express the participation of the House of\r\nCommons in the legislation of the country; and prove, as I have\r\nalready observed, that this participation was generally exercised\r\nby the presentation of petitions to the king; the lords\r\ndeliberated upon these petitions, which were afterwards converted\r\ninto statutes by the king, without being returned to the House of\r\nCommons to receive its express assent under the form of statutes.\r\nAccordingly, as the Commons did not interfere in the enactment of\r\nstatutes by any direct vote, their petitions were frequently\r\nmutilated and altered; and the statutes, which were drawn up\r\neither by the judges or by the members of the privy council, did\r\nnot always faithfully convey their meaning. It was probably with\r\na view to remedy this inconvenience that, in the Parliament of\r\n1341, a certain number of prelates, barons, and royal\r\ncouncillors, with twelve knights of shires and six burgesses,\r\nwere appointed a commission for the purpose of converting into\r\nstatutes such petitions as gave rise to measures of general\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nBut all the petitions of the Commons were not resolved into\r\nstatutes; they frequently gave occasion merely to ordinances.\r\nMany dissertations have been written upon the distinction between\r\nthe legislative acts designated by these two words. It has been\r\nmaintained that ordinances were issued by the king alone, by the\r\nadvice of the Lords, but without the concurrence of the Commons.\r\nOriginally, this distinction was incorrect, for most ordinances\r\nwere issued, just as statutes were enacted, upon the request of\r\nthe Commons. Thus, in 1364, the Parliament having desired the\r\npassing of sumptuary laws, the king demanded of both Houses, by\r\nthe chancellor, \"whether they would have such matters as they\r\nagreed on to be by way of ordinance or of statute?\" And they\r\nreplied: \"By way of ordinance, that they might amend the same at\r\ntheir pleasure.\" [Footnote 42] From this answer it has been\r\ninferred, with great appearance of reason, that the nature of\r\nstatutes was to be perpetual, whereas ordinances were only\r\ntemporary.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 42: Parliamentary History, vol. i. p. 128.]\r\n\r\nOrdinances were not inscribed, like statutes, upon the rolls of\r\nParliament; they were less solemn in their character, although\r\ntheir object frequently had reference to matters equally\r\nlegislative and of equally general interest, such as the\r\nenactment of jurisdiction or of penalties. It is not more easy to\r\nclearly distinguish ordinances from, statutes, than great\r\ncouncils from Parliaments properly so called. All that we can say\r\nis, that less importance and stability were attributed to this\r\nclass of legislative measures.\r\n\r\n{483}\r\n\r\n         Conservators Of The Peace.\r\n\r\nLegislative measures were not always adopted upon the petition of\r\nthe Commons; the king also exercised the right of initiative, not\r\nonly in matter of taxation, but in reference to all other\r\nsubjects of general interest. Thus, in 1333, Sir Jeffrey Scroop\r\nof Markham, in the king's presence, and at his command, informed\r\nthe prelates, earls, barons, and other nobles, of the disorders\r\ncommitted in the country by bands of armed marauders; pointed out\r\nthe necessity of repressing their outrages; and demanded of them\r\nto suggest to the king such measures as they deemed suitable to\r\neffect this purpose. The prelates hereupon retired, saying that\r\nit did not befit them to deliberate upon such a subject. The\r\nother nobles deliberated among themselves, and proposed to the\r\nking a series of regulations for the maintenance of the public\r\npeace. These regulations were read in presence of the nobles, the\r\nknights of the shires, and the \"commons--_genz du commun,_\"\r\nwho all gave their assent to them, and the necessary measures\r\nwere adopted in consequence. A result of this deliberation was\r\nthe restoration of the _Conservators of the Peace_, who had\r\nbeen temporarily appointed by the Earl of Leicester, during the\r\nreign of Henry III., and who were the precursors of the justices\r\nof the peace.\r\n\r\nAfter all, it is easy to imagine that, in the fourteenth century,\r\nconfused ideas were entertained as to what was and what was not\r\nmatter for legislation; since, in our own days, we not only feel,\r\nbut formally admit, the impossibility of fixing the limit _à\r\npriori_, in a philosophic and absolute manner.\r\n\r\n{484}\r\n\r\n              Lecture XXIII.\r\n\r\n  Continuation of the history of the progress of the Commons\r\n  House of Parliament during the reign of Edward III.\r\n\r\n  Their interference in questions of peace and war; and on the\r\n  internal peace of the kingdom.\r\n\r\n  Their resistance of the influence of the Pope, and of the\r\n  national clergy, in temporal affairs.\r\n\r\n  First efforts of the Commons to repress abuses at elections.\r\n\r\n  First traces of function of Committees of both Houses to\r\n  investigate certain questions in common.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Political Powers Assumed By Parliament.\r\n\r\nIt was not merely in the matter of taxation and of general\r\nlegislation that the House of Commons, during the reign of Edward\r\nIII., extended and consolidated its rights. Its interference in\r\nthe administration of public affairs, in politics properly so\r\ncalled, assumed at this period a development previously\r\nunexampled, and an entirely a novel character. It began really to\r\ntake part in the government of the State. This is proved by a\r\nmultitude of facts.\r\n\r\nFirst, in the matter of peace and war, its intervention became,\r\nat this period, habitual and almost indispensable. Mr. Hallam\r\nseems to me to have fallen into error on this subject; he is of\r\nopinion that the king alone, in the fourteenth century, desired\r\nthat the Commons should interfere in questions of this kind, in\r\norder that he might cast the responsibility upon them, but that\r\nthey constantly refused to incur it. I think that this assertion\r\nis incorrect. The Commons of the fourteenth century frequently\r\nsought and exercised this power, and accepted the attendant\r\nresponsibility; and they always gained greatly by it. The\r\nprincipal facts are these. In 1328, during the minority of\r\nEdward, and while Mortimer reigned in his name, the treaty of\r\npeace with Scotland, which fully liberated that kingdom from all\r\nfeudal subordination to England, was concluded with the consent\r\nof the Parliament. The Commons are expressly mentioned; and we\r\nmay suppose that Mortimer was anxious thereby to cover his own\r\nresponsibility for a disgraceful treaty.\r\n{485}\r\nIn 1331, Edward consulted the Parliament upon the question of\r\npeace or war with France, on account of his continental\r\npossessions, and also upon his projected journey to Ireland. The\r\nParliament gave its opinion in favour of peace and of the king's\r\ndeparture for Ireland. In 1336, it urged the king to declare war\r\nagainst Scotland, saying: \"That the king could no longer, with\r\nhonour, put up with the wrongs and injuries daily done to him and\r\nhis subjects by the Scots.\" [Footnote 43]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 43: Parliamentary History, vol. i, p. 93.]\r\n\r\nIn 1341, after Edward's first victories in France, the Parliament\r\npressed him to continue the war, and furnished him with large\r\nsubsidies; and all classes of society bestirred themselves to\r\nsupport the king in a conflict which had become national. In\r\n1343, the Parliament was convoked to examine and advise what had\r\nbest be done in the existing state of affairs, especially in\r\nregard to the treaty recently concluded by the king with his\r\nenemy the king of France. Sir Bartholomew Burghersh told the\r\nParliament that \"as the war was begun by the common advice of the\r\nprelates, great men, and commons, the king could not treat of, or\r\nmake peace, without the like assent.\" [Footnote 44]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 44:  Ibid. p. 106.]\r\n\r\nThe two houses deliberated separately, and gave their opinion\r\nthat the king ought to make peace if he could obtain a truce that\r\nwould be honourable and advantageous to himself and his friends;\r\nbut if not, the Commons declared that they would aid and maintain\r\nhis quarrel with all their power. In 1344, when the truce with\r\nthe king of France had been broken off by him, the Parliament, on\r\nbeing consulted, manifested a desire for peace, but thought it\r\ncould only be obtained by carrying on the war with energy, and\r\nvoted large subsidies for the purpose. In 1348, the war had\r\nbecome increasingly burdensome; all the subsidies proved\r\ninsufficient; and the king again consulted the Parliament\r\n\"concerning the war undertaken with its consent.\" The Commons,\r\nperceiving that they had gone rather too far in their language,\r\nnow showed greater reserve and answered \"that they were not able\r\nto advise anything concerning the war, and therefore desired to\r\nbe excused as to that point; and that the king will be advised by\r\nhis nobles and council, and what shall be by them determined,\r\nthey would consent unto, confirm, and establish.\" [Footnote 45]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 45: Parliamentary History, vol. i. p. 115.]\r\n\r\n{486}\r\n\r\n              The French Wars.\r\n\r\nIn 1354, the Lord Chamberlain, by the king's command, informed\r\nthe Parliament: \"That there was great hopes of bringing about a\r\npeace between England and France, yet the king would not conclude\r\nanything without the consent of his Lords and Commons. Wherefore\r\nhe demanded of them, in the king's name, whether they would\r\nassent and agree to a peace, if it might be had by treaty.\" To\r\nthis the Commons replied at first, \"that what should be agreeable\r\nto the king and his council in making of this treaty, would be so\r\nto them;\" but on being asked again, \"If they consented to a\r\nperpetual peace, if it might be had,\" they all unanimously cried\r\nout, Yea! Yea! [Footnote 46] Finally, on the 25th of January,\r\n1361, peace having been concluded by the treaty of Bretigny, the\r\nParliament was convoked, the treaty was submitted to its\r\ninspection and received its approval, and on the 31st a solemn\r\nceremony took place in the cathedral church at Westminster, when\r\nall the members of Parliament, both Lords and Commons,\r\nindividually swore upon the altar to observe the peace.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 46: Ibid. p. 122.]\r\n\r\nIn 1368, the negotiations with Scotland were submitted to the\r\nconsideration of the Parliament; the king of Scotland, David\r\nBruce, offered peace on condition of being relieved from all\r\nhomage of his crown to the king of England. The Lords and Commons\r\nreplied, \"That they could not assent to any such peace, upon any\r\naccount, without a disherison of the king, his heirs and crown,\r\nwhich they themselves were sworn to preserve, and therefore must\r\nadvise him not to hearken to any such propositions;\" [Footnote\r\n47] and they voted large subsidies to continue the war.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 47: Ibid. vol. i. p. 131.]\r\n\r\nIn 1369, the king consulted the Parliament as to whether he\r\nshould recommence the war with France, because the conditions of\r\nthe last treaty had not been observed; the Parliament advised him\r\nto do so, and votes subsidies.\r\n\r\nThese facts prove the most direct and constant intervention of\r\nthe Commons in matters of peace and war. Nor did they seek to\r\nelude this responsibility, so long as the war was successful and\r\nnational. When the subsidies became excessive, they manifested\r\ngreater reserve in giving their opinion beforehand.\r\n{487}\r\nWhen fortune turned decidedly against Edward III., at the close\r\nof his reign, the Commons, as we shall presently see, took\r\nadvantage of the right of intervention which they had acquired,\r\nto possess themselves also of the right of impeaching the\r\nministers to whom they attributed the misfortunes of the time.\r\nAll this follows in the natural course of things, and clearly\r\ndemonstrates the continually increasing influence of the Commons\r\nin political matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Influence On The Administration.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the internal administration of the country, their\r\nprogress was not less perceptible. Until the reign of Edward III.\r\nall attempts to encroach upon the central government had\r\noriginated with the barons; it was the barons who, under Henry\r\nIII. and Edward II., had seized upon the right of appointing to\r\ngreat public offices, and of disposing of the revenues of the\r\nState. In 1342, the Commons ventured a similar endeavour, less\r\ndirect and arrogant in its character, but tending towards the\r\nsame object by more regular and better chosen means. Profiting by\r\nthe necessities of the king, who was then destitute of funds, and\r\nutterly unable to continue the war with France, they presented to\r\nhim the two following petitions:\r\n\r\n  1. \"That certain by commission may hear the account of those\r\n  who have received wools, moneys, or other aid for the king, and\r\n  that the same may be enrolled in the chancery.\" To this the\r\n  king consented, upon condition that the treasurer and lord\r\n  chief baron should be members of the commission.\r\n\r\n  2. \"That the chancellor and other officers of state may be\r\n  chosen in open Parliament, and at the same time be openly sworn\r\n  to observe the laws of the land and Magna Charta.\" To this also\r\n  the king consented, but with these restrictions: \"That if any\r\n  such office, by the death or other failure of the incumbent,\r\n  become void, the choice to remain solely in the king, he taking\r\n  therein the assent of his council; but that every such officer\r\n  shall be sworn at the next Parliament, according to the\r\n  petition; and that every Parliament following the king shall\r\n  resume into his hands all such offices, so as the said officers\r\n  shall be left liable to answer all objections.\" [Footnote 48]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 48: Parliamentary History, vol. i. p. 104. ]\r\n\r\nThese decisions were immediately converted into statutes. The\r\nchancellor and treasurer, with the judges and other officers of\r\nthe crown, were required to swear to observe them upon the cross\r\nof Canterbury.\r\n{488}\r\nThe chancellor, treasurer, and several judges, protested against\r\nthis act, as being contrary to their first oath and to the laws\r\nof the realm; their protest was entered upon the rolls of\r\nParliament, but the statute was nevertheless definitively passed.\r\nThe Commons had now obtained the most formal recognition of the\r\nresponsibility of ministers to Parliament. The most pressing\r\nnecessities alone had extorted consent from the king. Scarcely\r\nhad the Parliament dissolved, when the king, by his own authority\r\nonly, formally revoked the statute by writs addressed to all the\r\nsheriffs; and it is a most singular circumstance that so illegal\r\nan act excited no remonstrance, and that the statute was revoked\r\nby the Parliament itself in the year following.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Interference With Ministers.\r\n\r\nThe mere attempt, however, was a great step. It proves that two\r\nfundamental ideas had taken possession of the minds of the\r\nrepresentatives of the Commons; first, that the Parliament ought\r\nto exercise some influence over the choice of the king's\r\nministers; secondly, that these ministers should be responsible\r\nto Parliament for their conduct. As to the first point, the\r\nCommons of the fourteenth century employed a very bad method of\r\nobtaining it, by claiming that their influence over the choice of\r\nthe agents of the supreme power should be direct, and by\r\ninterfering directly in the appointment of ministers; they\r\nprodigiously weakened, if they did not utterly destroy,\r\nministerial responsibility: and the progress of representative\r\ngovernment has proved that indirect influence, exercised in such\r\nmatters by a majority of the Parliament, is alone admissible and\r\nefficacious. But it was a great thing for the Commons to have\r\nattained such growth as to dare to entertain such an idea of\r\ntheir rights. They resumed the exercise of these rights, with\r\ngreater success, at the close of this reign. The king was old and\r\nfeeble; his arms were everywhere unsuccessful; abuses multiplied\r\nat his court; Edward had fallen beneath the sway of favourites;\r\none of his sons, the Duke of Lancaster, alone enjoyed his favour,\r\nand abused it; a woman, named Alice Perers or Pierce, possessed a\r\nshameful influence over him, which she employed chiefly in\r\nsupporting the interest of her friends, in the courts of justice.\r\nShe might often be seen, sitting within the precincts of the\r\njudicial tribunals, intimidating by her presence the judges whom\r\nshe had pestered with her solicitations.\r\n\r\n{489}\r\n\r\n              Their Impeachment.\r\n\r\nA report was spread at the same time that the Duke of Lancaster\r\nintended to have himself declared heir to the crown, to the\r\nprejudice of the youthful son of the Black Prince, who was then\r\nin a dying state, and who possessed the affection of the whole\r\nnation. A Parliament was convoked in 1376; and a powerful party\r\nin both Houses pronounced against the ministers of the king. In\r\nthe Upper House, the Black Prince himself led the attack, and in\r\nthe Lower House, the opposition was headed by Peter de la Mare.\r\nThe Commons demanded that the king's council should be augmented\r\nby ten or twelve members, prelates, lords, or others; that no\r\nimportant matter should be decided without the consent of six or\r\nfour of them; and finally, that all the officers of the crown\r\nshould be sworn to receive no present, emolument, or reward\r\nbeyond their legal salaries and expenses. The king consented to\r\nall these demands upon condition that he should himself appoint\r\nthe new councillors, and that the chancellor, the treasurer, and\r\nthe keeper of the privy seal should be allowed to discharge the\r\nduties of their office without their interference. The Commons\r\nnext endeavoured to obtain that the justices of peace in each\r\ncounty should be appointed by the lords and knights of that\r\ncounty in Parliament, and should not be removed without their\r\nconsent; but the king refused to grant this. The Commons\r\ncontinued to complain of the king's evil counsellors, attributing\r\nto them the distress into which the king had fallen, the\r\ndilapidation of the subsidies, and so forth. Finally, with a view\r\nto the immediate application of the principles which they\r\nmaintained, they formerly impeached the Lords Latimer and Nevil,\r\nwho occupied posts in the king's household, and four merchants of\r\nLondon, named Lyon, Ellis, Peachey, and Bury, who were farmers of\r\nthe royal subsidies. This accusation had its effect; the accused\r\npersons were declared incapable of all public employment, and\r\nbanished from the court and council, and their property was\r\nconfiscated. As for Alice Perers, the Commons attacked her also,\r\nand the king was constrained to issue the following ordinance:\r\n\"Whereas complaint has been brought before the king that some\r\nwomen have pursued causes and actions in the king's court by way\r\nof maintenance, and for hire or reward, which, thing displeases\r\nthe king, the king forbids that any woman do it hereafter, and in\r\nparticular Alice Perers, under the penalty of forfeiting all that\r\nthe said Alice can forfeit, and of being banished out of the\r\nrealm.\" [Footnote 49]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 49: Rot. Parl. ii. 329.]\r\n\r\n{490}\r\n\r\nNothing of this kind had previously been attempted by the\r\nCommons. This Parliament sat from the end of April to the 6th of\r\nJuly, 1376, that is, for a longer period than any preceding\r\nParliament; the number of its petitions to the king was 223, and\r\nall its acts were so popular that it received the name of the\r\nGood Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Death Of The Black Prince.\r\n\r\nBut the Commons were not in a position to maintain unassisted so\r\nbrilliant a success; their triumph had been due in great measure\r\nto the co-operation of the Black Prince and his party in the\r\nUpper House; and the Black Prince died before the closing of the\r\nParliament. The king, by settling the crown upon his son Richard,\r\ndissipated many fears. A new Parliament was convoked on the 27th\r\nof January, 1377, and one of his first acts was to solicit the\r\nrevocation of the sentence passed in the preceding year against\r\nLord Latimer and Alice Perers; which request was granted. Six or\r\nseven only of those knights who had been members of the previous\r\nParliament sat in the new one; and Peter de la Mare was\r\nimprisoned. Nevertheless, the new Parliament maintained the\r\nrights already acquired in several particulars; it insisted upon\r\nthe proper appropriation of the subsidies, upon an account being\r\ngiven of the receipts, and so forth. The death of Edward III.\r\nwhich occurred on the 21st of June, 1377, put an end to a\r\nstruggle which was probably about to arise once more between the\r\nCommons and the advisers of the crown.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this intervention of the House of Commons in the\r\ngeneral affairs of the State, some particular facts prove the\r\nprogress which its influence was making in all respects, and\r\ndeserve to be remarked in this point of view.\r\n\r\n{491}\r\n\r\n         Opposition To The Clergy.\r\n\r\n  I. The Commons began energetically to resist both the power\r\n  which the Pope still assumed to exercise in England, and the\r\n  internal influence of the English clergy themselves. In 1343,\r\n  they protested against the right which the Pope claimed to have\r\n  to appoint foreigners to certain vacant ecclesiastical\r\n  benefices, and against other abuses of the same kind. They\r\n  called upon his majesty and the lords to aid them in expelling\r\n  the papal power from the kingdom, and addressed to the Pope\r\n  himself a letter full of the most indignant remonstrances.\r\n  Previously, the barons alone had actively interfered in affairs\r\n  of this kind. In 1366, the king informed the Parliament that\r\n  the Pope intended to cite him to Avignon to do homage for his\r\n  crown, according to the terms of the treaty concluded with king\r\n  John, and also to pay the tribute promised upon that occasion.\r\n  The Lords on the one hand, and the Commons on the other,\r\n  replied that king John had no right to contract such\r\n  engagements without the consent of the Parliament, called upon\r\n  the king to refuse to comply with the Pope's citation, and\r\n  promised to support him with all their power. In 1371, the\r\n  Commons complained that the great offices of the State were\r\n  occupied by ecclesiastics, to the great detriment of the king\r\n  and the state, and demanded that in future they should be\r\n  excluded therefrom, leaving to the king the right of choosing\r\n  his officers, provided they were laymen. Finally, in 1377, they\r\n  demanded that no ordinance or statute should be enacted upon\r\n  petition of the clergy, without the consent of the Commons; and\r\n  that the Commons should be bound by none of the constitutions\r\n  which the clergy might make for its own advantage and without\r\n  their consent, since the clergy would not be bound by the\r\n  statutes or ordinances of the king to which they had not\r\n  consented. This conflict between the national representatives\r\n  and the clergy soon became a permanent habit, which contributed\r\n  powerfully, in the sixteenth century, to the introduction of\r\n  the Reformation.\r\n\r\n  II. In 1337, the Parliament turned its attention to the\r\n  protection of the national industry. It prohibited the\r\n  exportation of English wools, and granted great encouragement\r\n  to those foreign clothworkers who should take up their\r\n  residence in England. These regulations soon fell into\r\n  desuetude in consequence of the wars with France; but they\r\n  prove the disposition of the Parliament to give attention to\r\n  all matters of public interest.\r\n\r\n{492}\r\n\r\n         Regulation Of Elections.\r\n\r\n  III. It was also during this reign that, for the first time, we\r\n  find the Parliament manifesting anxiety about the abuses which\r\n  were committed at elections, and seeking to prevent their\r\n  recurrence. In 1372, an ordinance, passed at the suggestion and\r\n  by the advice of the Commons, prohibited the election of\r\n  sheriffs during the continuance of their functions, and also of\r\n  lawyers, because they made use of their authority to procure\r\n  their own election, and afterwards cared only for their own\r\n  private interests. [Footnote 50]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 50: The influence of the king upon elections was\r\n    manifested at this period in a direct manner, or nearly so.\r\n    Two edicts of Edward III., passed at an interval of more than\r\n    forty years, prove this. The first, dated on the 3rd of\r\n    November, 1330, concludes thus: \"And because that, before\r\n    this time, several knights, representatives for counties,\r\n    were people of ill designs and maintainers of false quarrels,\r\n    and would not suffer that our good subjects should show the\r\n    grievances of the common people, nor the matters which ought\r\n    to be redressed in Parliament, to the great damage of us and\r\n    our subjects;--we, therefore, charge and command that you\r\n    cause to be elected, with the common consent of your county,\r\n    two, the most proper and most sufficient knights, or sergeants\r\n    of the said county, that are the least suspected of\r\n    ill designs, or common maintainers of parties, to be of our\r\n    said Parliament, according to the form of our writ which you\r\n    have with you. And this we expect you shall do, as you will\r\n    eschew our anger and indignation.\" (_Parl. Hist._ vol. i. p.\r\n    84.) This writ was issued at the time when the young king had\r\n    just delivered himself from the yoke of Mortimer and his\r\n    faction. The second writ, dated in 1373, orders the sheriffs\r\n    \"to cause to be chosen two dubbed knights, or the most\r\n    worthy, honest, and discreet esquires of that county, the\r\n    most expert in feats of arms, and no others; and of every\r\n    city two citizens, of every borough two burgesses, discreet\r\n    and sufficient, and such who had the greatest skill in\r\n    shipping and merchandizing.\" _Parl. Hist._ vol. i. p. 137.]\r\n\r\n  IV. Finally, it is under this reign that we first find\r\n  committees of the two Houses uniting to investigate certain\r\n  questions in common, and afterwards reporting the result of\r\n  their investigations to their respective Houses. It is\r\n  remarkable that this usage, so necessary to facilitate the\r\n  progress of the representative system and to procure good\r\n  deliberations, should have arisen precisely at that period when\r\n  the Parliament became divided into two Houses. It was the\r\n  natural consequence of their former combination in a single\r\n  assembly. There was no regular or invariable plan with regard\r\n  to the mode of the formation of these committees. Sometimes the\r\n  king himself appointed a certain number of lords, and invited\r\n  the Commons to choose a certain number of their own members to\r\n  confer with them; sometimes the Commons named the lords with\r\n  whom they wished to confer; and sometimes each House appointed\r\n  its own committee.\r\n\r\n{493}\r\n\r\n         Confirmations Of The Old Charters.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that most of the parliamentary sessions of this\r\nreign begin with a confirmation of Magna Charta and the Charta de\r\nForesta, which were always regarded as the foundation of the\r\npublic rights and liberties, and also violated with sufficient\r\nfrequency to render it necessary incessantly to renew their\r\nconcession.\r\n\r\nAll these facts prove the immense progress made by representative\r\ngovernment in general, and by the House of Commons in particular,\r\nduring the course of this reign.\r\n\r\n{494}\r\n\r\n                   Lecture XXIV.\r\n\r\n  State of the Parliament under Richard II.\r\n\r\n  Struggle between absolute royalty and parliamentary government.\r\n\r\n  Origin of the Civil List.\r\n\r\n  Progress of the responsibility of ministers.\r\n\r\n  Progress of the returns of the employment of the public revenue.\r\n\r\n  The Commons encroach upon the government.\r\n\r\n  Reaction against the sway of the Commons.\r\n\r\n  Violence and fall of Richard II.\r\n\r\n  Progress of the essential maxims and practices of\r\n  representative government.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Parliament Under Richard II.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact in the history of England that, during\r\nthe interval which elapsed between the years of 1216 and 1399, an\r\nable monarch always succeeded an incapable king, and _vice\r\nversâ_. This circumstance proved very favourable to the\r\nestablishment of free institutions, which never had time either\r\nto fall beneath the yoke of an energetic despotism or to dissolve\r\nin anarchy.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Richard II. does not present, like that of Edward\r\nIII., the spectacle of the struggle of the Commons in defending\r\ntheir rights, and extending them by the very fact that they were\r\ndefending them against the royal power, which was incessantly\r\nstriving to evade those rights because they checked its\r\nauthority, but which was nevertheless sufficiently acute to\r\nperceive that it stood in need of the assistance of the people,\r\nand could not afford to quarrel with their representatives.\r\nDuring the reign of Richard, the conflict assumes a more general\r\ncharacter; it now involves far more than special or occasional\r\nacts of resistance. The question at issue now is, whether the\r\nking shall govern according to the advice and under the control\r\nof his Parliament, or rule alone and in an almost arbitrary\r\nmanner. A positive conflict arose between parliamentary\r\ngovernment and purely royal government; a violent conflict, full\r\nof reciprocal iniquities, but in which the question between\r\nliberty in general and absolute power was laid down more clearly\r\nand completely than it had ever been before.\r\n\r\n{495}\r\n\r\n              Increased Power Of The Commons.\r\n\r\nThe vicissitudes of this struggle are broadly outlined in facts.\r\nThe reign of Richard II. may be divided into two parts. From 1377\r\nto 1389, the government was parliamentary, that is to say, the\r\nParliament exercised the supreme control and really directed all\r\npublic affairs, notwithstanding the attempts at resistance on the\r\npart of the king and his favourites. Prom 1389 to 1399, this\r\nstate of things underwent a change, and the king progressively\r\nregained the upper hand. Not that the Parliament abandoned or\r\nlost all its rights; for that of voting the taxes, in particular,\r\nwas boldly maintained, and even respected to a certain extent.\r\nBut generally speaking, the government was arbitrary, the king\r\nhad the sole disposal of it, and the Parliament, which had lost\r\nits preponderating influence, interfered only as an instrument.\r\nThis state of things was contrary to the desires and instincts of\r\nthe country, and it was terminated by a tragical event. Richard\r\nwas deposed by a proscribed exile who landed in England with\r\nsixty men, but found both the Parliament and the entire nation\r\ndisposed to support him, or at all events, not to oppose him. The\r\ndeposition of Richard and the elevation of the House of Lancaster\r\nwere the work of force, but of force supported by that powerful\r\nadhesion which the silence and immobility of the public afford to\r\nenterprises which tend to overthrow an odious or despised\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nSuch was the general aspect of this reign. I shall not linger to\r\ndetail its events, but merely select and bring to light those\r\nfacts which relate to the condition of the public institutions of\r\nthe country, and which prove the truth of that which I have just\r\naffirmed.\r\n\r\nAs you have already seen, during the last years of the reign of\r\nEdward III., the influence of the Commons in the government had\r\nrapidly augmented; and its further progress was favoured by the\r\nminority of Richard II. Sixty years before, the nonage of the\r\nking would have placed the State under the control of some\r\nfaction of barons; but during the latter half of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, the Commons take the initiative in all things, and\r\nplainly say how they think the government should be administered.\r\n\r\n{496}\r\n              Important Petitions.\r\n\r\nA first Parliament was convoked in the month of September, 1377.\r\nPeter de la Mare, formerly the leader of the opposition, was\r\nliberated from prison, and chosen speaker of the House of\r\nCommons. Three lords selected by the Commons were appointed to\r\nconfer with them regarding the public necessities. Three\r\npropositions were submitted by the Commons to the king and lords:\r\n\r\n  1. the formation of a council of government;\r\n\r\n  2. the appointment of \"men of virtuous and honest conversation\"\r\n  to guard the person and conduct the education of the king, and\r\n  to take care \"that the charge of the king's household should be\r\n  borne by the revenues of the crown, so that what was granted to\r\n  the wars might be expended that way only;\"\r\n\r\n  3. the strict observance of the common law and statutes of the\r\n  realm, \"that they might not be defeated by the singularity of\r\n  any about the king.\" [Footnote 51]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 51: Parliamentary History, vol. i. p. 160. ]\r\n\r\nThe Lords granted the first proposition, rejected the first part\r\nof the second as too harsh and interfering too much with the\r\nliberty of the royal person, promised to deliberate upon the\r\nsecond part with the great officers of the king's household, and\r\ngave their unhesitating assent to the third proposition.\r\n\r\nThe second of these propositions contains the germ of the\r\ndistinction between the civil list and taxes voted for the public\r\nexpenditure. A subsidy was voted by the Commons, after the\r\nestablishment of the administration. It was agreed that moneys\r\nthus raised should be lodged in the keeping of special\r\ntreasurers, who should give an account of their receipts and\r\ndisbursements, in such manner as the king and council should\r\norder. Two London merchants, William Walworth and John Philpot,\r\nwere appointed to this office by the king.\r\n\r\nSeveral other petitions were presented by this Parliament.\r\n\r\n  1. That the evil councillors of the late king Edward might be\r\n  removed from the royal councils;--which was granted.\r\n\r\n  2. That, during the king's minority, all the ministers and\r\n  other great functionaries of State, might be appointed by\r\n  Parliament; and that if an office fell vacant, while Parliament\r\n  was not sitting, it should be filled up by the king's council,\r\n  subject to the approval of the next Parliament;--which was\r\n  granted in the case of the greater officers, but refused in\r\n  respect to those of less importance.\r\n\r\n  3. That Parliament should be holden once a year;--in reply to\r\n  which it was promised that \"the statutes made for that purpose\r\n  shall be observed and kept.\" [Footnote 52]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 52: Ibid.  vol. i. pp. 161, 162.]\r\n\r\nIt is clear that, in all these matters, the initiative and\r\ngeneral direction of the government belonged to the Commons.\r\n\r\n{497}\r\n\r\n              Regulation Of Subsidies.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of April, 1378, a second Parliament met, and voted a\r\npoll-tax, as the king had involved himself by loans. The\r\nchancellor concluded his speech by saying that, for all past and\r\nprobable expenditure, the treasurers were prepared to give\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of October, 1378, a third Parliament met, and a fresh\r\nsubsidy was demanded. The Commons maintained that the king ought\r\nnot to be in want of one, and that a promise had been made that\r\nno further imposts should be levied for a long time. The\r\nchancellor, Richard le Scroop, denied that any such promise had\r\nbeen made; and long and violent debates ensued upon this\r\nquestion. The Commons demanded that an account should be given\r\nthem of the way in which the last subsidy had been spent. The\r\nchancellor asserted that they had no right to require this, but\r\nfinally yielded, under protest that it should not be considered a\r\nprecedent. The Commons accordingly examined the accounts.\r\n\r\nThe Commons next requested that five or six lords or prelates\r\nshould be deputed to confer with them respecting the public\r\ncharges: thus aspiring to make their own body the centre of\r\ndeliberation, and affecting to regard the lords only as a part of\r\nthe king's council. The lords refused their request, and proposed\r\nthat, according to ancient usage, each house should appoint\r\ncertain of its members to confer together. This suggestion was\r\nadopted, and a subsidy voted. The Commons further demanded the\r\nappointment of special treasurers to receive and disburse its\r\nproceeds; which was granted.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of January, 1380, a fourth Parliament was held, for\r\nthe purpose of demanding fresh subsidies, rendered necessary by\r\nthe wars with France and Scotland, the revolts in Gascony, and\r\nother causes. The chancellor concluded his speech by saying \"that\r\nthe lords of the great council were ready to lay before the\r\nCommons the receipts of the last subsidial grants, and the\r\ndisbursements of the same.\"\r\n\r\nThe Commons demanded:\r\n\r\n  1. That the counsellors given to the king at his accession,\r\n  should be dismissed (probably because they suspected them of\r\n  unfaithfulness in the management of the public revenue);\r\n\r\n{498}\r\n\r\n 2. That the five chief officers of State should not be changed\r\n until the next Parliament;\r\n\r\n  3. That a commission should be formed to survey and examine, in\r\n  all his courts and palaces, the state of the king's household,\r\n  and the expenses and receipts in all the offices;--which was\r\n  granted, and the commission composed of six lords and six\r\n  members of the House of Commons;\r\n\r\n  4. That some of the most discreet barons should be placed about\r\n  the king, in order to give wise answers to foreign ministers.\r\n  One baron only, the Earl of Warwick, was appointed for this\r\n  purpose. A subsidy was then voted.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Disturbed State Of The Country.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1380, a fifth Parliament met to vote further\r\nsubsidies; and a long discussion arose between the Commons and\r\nthe Lords regarding the amount. A fixed sum of £16,000 was\r\nrequired; to meet which the Commons voted a poll-tax of 15 groats\r\non every individual above 15 years of age, mendicants alone\r\nexcepted; and annexed to their vote the condition that the rich\r\nshould help the poor to pay the tax. The Commons moreover voted\r\nthat \"no knight, citizen, or burgess of the present Parliament\r\nshould be collector of this money;\" apparently in order to avoid\r\nevery suspicion of partiality in its assessment. A violent\r\npopular insurrection broke out in consequence of this tax; and in\r\norder to quell it, the king was obliged to make promises of\r\ngeneral enfranchisement.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of September, 1382, a sixth Parliament assembled; but\r\nwas adjourned on account of a quarrel between the Duke of\r\nLancaster and the Earl of Northumberland, who had both come\r\nthither in arms, with a numerous retinue. The importance of these\r\ngreat barons was such that the Parliament could not meet until\r\nthe king had succeeded in reconciling them. Great agitation was\r\nfelt in this Parliament, as it did not know how to calm the\r\ndisturbance in the country. The charter of manumission which had\r\nbeen extorted from the king was revoked. The Commons accused the\r\nbad government of the king of having caused the insurrection, and\r\ndrew a melancholy picture of the deplorable state of the people.\r\nA committee of inquiry was appointed in consequence. The Commons\r\nrefused to grant a subsidy, basing their refusal upon the\r\ndisposition of the country to revolt. The king declared that he\r\nwould not grant his amnesty for all the offences committed during\r\nthe late insurrection, unless a subsidy were granted; and under\r\nthe influence of this threat, the Commons yielded.\r\n\r\n{499}\r\n\r\n              Conferences With The Lords.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of this Parliament, the Commons demanded that the\r\nprelates, the lords temporal, the knights, the judges, in a word,\r\nthe various estates of the realm, should examine, each for their\r\nown class, the charges which should be brought; and should report\r\nthe same to the Commons, who would deliberate upon it. This was\r\nan attempt to make themselves a sovereign and undivided assembly;\r\nbut the king maintained the ancient usage, which required that\r\nthe Commons should deliberate first of all, and communicate their\r\npropositions to the king and lords.\r\n\r\nThis Parliament was twice prorogued; from the 15th of December to\r\nthe 15th of January, 1383, and again from the latter date to the\r\n7th of May.\r\n\r\nSeven sessions of the Parliament were held from the 7th of May\r\n1383, to the 1st of October 1386. The king endeavoured to free\r\nhimself from the control of the Parliament. In 1383, he dismissed\r\na very popular chancellor, Richard le Scroop, because he had\r\nrefused to seal some inconsiderate gifts of property which had\r\nbecome confiscated to the crown. During the same year, the clergy\r\nobtained from the king a violent statute against the Lollards or\r\ndisciples of Wickliffe. The Commons complained of this, saying\r\nthat the statute was surreptitious; that it had never received\r\ntheir consent, and that \"it was not their meaning to bind\r\nthemselves, or their successors, to the prelates, any more than\r\ntheir ancestors had done before them.\" They, therefore, demanded\r\nand obtained the revocation of the statute; but after their\r\ndeparture, the act of revocation was set aside, and the statute\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nIn 1383, also, the Commons having demanded to confer with a\r\ncommittee of lords whom they mentioned by name, the king\r\nconsented to their request, but added that it belonged to him\r\nalone to appoint the lords whom he thought fit to send to such\r\nconferences. In the same Parliament the Commons prayed the king\r\n\"to place the most discreet and valuable officers about his\r\nperson,\" and to regulate his household in such a way that his\r\nrevenues might be well administered, and prove sufficient to meet\r\nhis wants.\r\n\r\n{500}\r\n\r\n              Opposition To Parliamentary Rights.\r\n\r\nThe king answered that he would summon to him the persons who\r\nsuited him, and that he would regulate his household by the\r\nadvice of his council. In 1386, the Commons petitioned that the\r\nstate of the king's household should be examined every year by\r\nthe chancellor, the treasurer, and the keeper of the privy seal;\r\nand that they should be authorized to reform its abuses. The king\r\nreplied that he would order such an examination when it pleased\r\nhim. The Commons next inquired who were the ministers and chief\r\nofficers of State whom the king intended to place at the head of\r\naffairs. The king replied that he had officers sufficient at\r\npresent, and would change them at his pleasure. All these facts\r\nindicate an effort on the part of the king and his council to\r\nfree themselves from the control of Parliament. In proportion as\r\nthis desire became apparent, the Commons became, in certain\r\nrespects, more timid and reserved. In 1383, the king consulted\r\nthem as to whether he should march in person at the head of his\r\narmy against France; and they replied that it was not in their\r\nprovince to decide upon such a question, but that it should be\r\nreferred to the council. In 1385, they were consulted on the\r\nquestion of peace or war with France: and refused to give an\r\nopinion. The king insisted upon having an answer, but all that he\r\ncould obtain from them was that \"if they were in the king's\r\nplace, they would prefer peace.\" Every circumstance, on both\r\nsides, indicates an imminent separation, or at least a\r\nprogressive estrangement. The king was desirous to escape from\r\nthe guidance of the Parliament; and the Parliament refused to\r\nshare the responsibility of the king's council.\r\n\r\nRichard was under the sway of two favourites, Robert de Vere,\r\nMarquis of Dublin, and Michael de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk. Hence\r\nthe government was courtly, capricious, destructive, and laid\r\nclaim to an insolent and frivolous exercise of arbitrary\r\nauthority. The haughty tone of the chancellor Suffolk was\r\nextremely offensive in the speeches with which he opened the\r\nParliaments of 1384 and 1385. The Commons could endure the\r\ngovernment (though often tyrannical) of a council of barons with\r\nmuch greater willingness than that of a pack of court favourites.\r\nThe great feudal aristocracy were deeply rooted in the\r\nassociations of the country; but the arrogance and frivolity of\r\nfavourites were unspeakably offensive to the people.\r\n\r\n{501}\r\n              The King Compelled To Yield.\r\n\r\nThe storm broke out in the Parliament which met on the 1st of\r\nOctober, 1386. The Commons, \"with one accord,\" impeached the Earl\r\nof Suffolk. The king withdrew to Eltham. The two Houses sent to\r\nhim to demand the dismissal of the lord treasurer and of the\r\nchancellor, relating to whom, they said, they had matters to\r\ntreat of which could not be safely done whilst he remained in his\r\noffice. The king sent an evasive answer; and the Parliament\r\ndeclared that it would do nothing so long as the king continued\r\nabsent, and the Earl of Suffolk remained minister. The king\r\nproposed that they should depute forty knights of their number to\r\nconfer with him. The Parliament refused. After a long and\r\nsingular correspondence, the king was constrained to yield and to\r\nchoose new ministers.\r\n\r\nDoubt has been cast upon several of these facts, and especially\r\nupon the king's correspondence with the Parliament. Knyghton is\r\nthe only historian who records it, but there is reason to believe\r\nit authentic. The Earl of Suffolk was impeached and condemned.\r\nThe charges brought against him were of little weight as legal\r\ncrimes, but of great importance as abuses in the government. A\r\ncommittee of eleven lords was appointed by Parliament to regulate\r\nall public affairs, and to govern in concert with the king., The\r\nParliament enacted the penalties of high treason against any\r\nperson who should advise the king not to follow the counsels of\r\nthis committee, and constrained the king to confirm these\r\nresolutions by letters-patent. The king, on his part, made\r\nprotestation in full Parliament, with his own mouth, \"that for\r\nany thing which was done in that Parliament he would not any\r\nprejudice should come to him or his crown; but that the\r\nprerogative and liberties of it should be safe and preserved.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1387, the king travelled through the west and north of\r\nEngland; and assembled at Nottingham a council composed of\r\npartisans of his favourites. He inquired of the sheriffs of the\r\nneighbouring counties what forces they could raise for his\r\nassistance, if he should find it necessary to oppose the\r\ncommittee of eleven lords. The sheriffs replied that the people\r\nwere convinced that the lords were friends to the king, and\r\ndesired the welfare of the country, and that therefore few\r\npersons would be found willing to take up arms against them.\r\n{502}\r\nThe king then commanded the sheriffs to elect to the next\r\nParliament those persons only whom he should nominate. They\r\nanswered that they could not undertake to secure the election of\r\nany persons but those who were to the people's liking. The king\r\nthen summoned the judges to Nottingham, and proposed to them\r\nvarious questions concerning the rights and prerogatives of the\r\ncrown. The judges, either intimidated or guided by Sir Robert\r\nTressillian, gave answers tending to establish the arbitrary\r\npower of the king and to free his government from the control of\r\nthe Parliament. This was the evident object of the whole of this\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\n\r\n              The Wonderful Parliament.\r\n\r\nDissension now broke out between the king and the lords. A\r\nParliament was convoked. The king inserted in his writs an order\r\nto return those persons who were _debatis modernis magis\r\nindifferentes_; but he was soon obliged to erase this clause,\r\nand to declare it illegal in new writs. The Parliament met on the\r\n3rd of February, 1388, and took precautions to ensure that it\r\nshould alone decide upon all great public matters, and that it\r\nshould not be dissolved after having voted a subsidy. An\r\naccusation was lodged by five lords, called appellants, against\r\nthe favourites of the king, and the judges. This accusation\r\nreally conceals a great party conflict beneath the forms of\r\njudicial procedure. The Upper House declared that, on such grave\r\noccasions, the Parliament alone could judge, and was bound by\r\nnone of the laws which regulate the proceedings of other courts.\r\nEighteen persons were condemned, most of them to death, and many\r\nby default. The Parliament separated after having sat five\r\nmonths. It was called the _Wonderful Parliament_, and also\r\nthe _Pitiless Parliament_. It had been careful to declare\r\nthat the condemnation of the favourite councillors and judges,\r\ndid not in any way throw discredit upon the king himself.\r\n\r\n{503}\r\n              Increase Of The Royal Power.\r\n\r\nThe authority of the committee of eleven lords over the\r\ngovernment was exercised without opposition for a year. In May,\r\n1389, the king assembled his council, and declared that, being\r\nnow of full age, he was capable of governing his inheritance\r\nhimself, and that it was not fitting that he should be in a worse\r\ncondition than every subject in his dominions who could freely\r\ndispose of his goods. \"It is well known,\" he said, \"that for\r\nseveral years I have lived under your guardianship, and I thank\r\nyou for the trouble you have taken on my account; but now that I\r\nhave reached my majority, I am determined to remain no longer\r\nunder tutelage, but to take in hand the government of my kingdom\r\nand to appoint or revoke my ministers and other officers\r\naccording to my pleasure.\" He changed the chancellor and other\r\ngreat officers, and dismissed from his council several of the\r\neleven lords.\r\n\r\nHere began the second epoch in this reign--the epoch of reaction\r\nagainst the Parliament. Great obscurity prevails as to the causes\r\nwhich placed Richard II. in a position to effect such a\r\nrevolution; but he was most probably emboldened to do so by\r\ndivision in the committee of eleven lords, and by the bad use\r\nwhich some of them had made of their power. The king and his new\r\ncouncil governed at first with prudence, and manifested great\r\nrespect for the Parliament. On the 16th of January, 1390, a\r\nParliament was convoked. The new ministers resigned their\r\noffices, and submitted their conduct to its scrutiny. The\r\nParliament declared that it found no cause for complaint, and the\r\nministers resumed their functions. Seven Parliaments were held\r\nfrom 1390 to 1397. They became more and more timid and docile,\r\nand the king's authority assumed an increasingly extended and\r\narbitrary character. These are the principal facts which\r\ncharacterize this reaction:--\r\n\r\nIn 1391, the Parliament assured the king that the royalty and\r\nprerogatives of his crown should ever remain intact and\r\ninviolable; that if they had in any way been infringed, it should\r\nbe reformed; and that the king should enjoy as large liberty as\r\nany of his predecessors ever did: \"which prayer seemed to our\r\nlord the king honest and reasonable,\" and he consented to it. In\r\n1391 and 1392, the Parliament admitted the king's power to\r\ndispense with the observance of certain statutes in\r\necclesiastical matters, on condition that these statutes should\r\nnot be held to be thereby revoked. In 1392, the king, being\r\noffended with the city of London, withdrew from it its liberties\r\nand imprisoned its magistrates; but shortly afterwards he\r\nrestored its liberties to the city, and imposed on it a fine of\r\n£1000 sterling.\r\n{504}\r\nIn 1394, the judges who had been banished to Ireland by the\r\nParliament of 1388, were recalled. In 1397, a bill was brought\r\nforward in the House of Commons, proposing that all extravagant\r\nexpenditure should be avoided in the royal household, and that\r\nthose bishops and ladies who had nothing to do at court should\r\nnot have permission to reside there. The king was incensed at\r\nthis bill before it was presented to him, and said in the Upper\r\nHouse, \"that it was directed against those liberties and\r\nroyalties which his progenitors had enjoyed, and which he was\r\nresolved to uphold and maintain.\" He ordered the Lords to inform\r\nthe Commons of his resolution, and directed the Duke of Lancaster\r\nto command Sir John Bussy, the Speaker of the Commons, to inform\r\nhim what member had introduced the bill into Parliament. The\r\nCommons became alarmed, and humbly besought the king's pardon. At\r\na conference, they placed the bill in the king's hands, and\r\ndelivered up to him its proposer, Thomas Haxey. The king forgave\r\nthem, and the Parliament itself declared Haxey guilty of treason.\r\nThe clergy saved his life by claiming him as a clerk--which\r\nproves that at this period ecclesiastics were not excluded from\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1397, Richard II. at length judged himself in a\r\nposition to assume the plenitude of his power, to annul all that\r\nhad been done in 1388 to limit his authority, and to avenge his\r\ninjuries.\r\n\r\nA Parliament was convoked. Every precaution had been taken to\r\nensure its docility. The sheriffs had been changed; and all sorts\r\nof practices had been put in force to influence the elections.\r\nNumerous bodies of troops formed the royal guard. The Parliament\r\nwas opened with great solemnity. The chancellor, the Bishop of\r\nExeter, took as the text of his speech: _Rex unus erit\r\nomnibus._ Subsequent events fully corresponded with these\r\npreliminaries. All the acts of the Parliament of 1388 were\r\nrevoked, and their authors accused of treason; five of them were\r\ncondemned to death. The principal leader of the opposition, the\r\nDuke of Gloucester, was assassinated in prison at Calais, after\r\nhaving been constrained to acknowledge his past crimes in a\r\nconfession in which he formerly accused himself of having\r\n\"restrained the king of his freedom.\" After these condemnations\r\nthe same Parliament held a second session at Shrewsbury, in which\r\nthe answers of the judges in 1387 were declared good and\r\nlegitimate, and precisely the same measures were taken to render\r\nthese new decisions inviolable, which had been employed by the\r\nParliament of 1388 to ensure the observance of its own\r\nresolutions. These two sessions lasted sixteen days. In less than\r\ntwo years afterwards, Richard was dethroned.\r\n\r\n{505}\r\n\r\n              Discontent In The Realm.\r\n\r\nHe thought himself, however, well secured against such a\r\ncontingency; for he had taken all sorts of precautions firmly to\r\nestablish the power which he had just regained. The Parliament\r\nhad granted him, for his lifetime, the duty upon wools and hides,\r\nupon condition only that this concession should not be regarded\r\nas a precedent by the kings his successors. As several of the\r\npetitions and other matters laid before the Parliament during its\r\nlast session had not been fully terminated, the Parliament at its\r\ndissolution appointed a permanent committee of twelve lords and\r\nsix members of the House of Commons, to whom it transferred its\r\npowers to regulate and decide, in concert with the king, all\r\naffairs of public business. Richard thus remained surrounded by\r\nthe men who had just assisted him to regain arbitrary power; and\r\nalthough the mission of this committee was limited to the\r\nsettlement of those affairs only which the Parliament had not had\r\ntime to arrange, it did not hesitate to take possession of the\r\nentire government. In concert with the king, it issued\r\nordinances, and declared the penalties of high treason against\r\nany person who should attempt to resist its authority; and it\r\nimposed on all the lords the obligation, under oath, to respect\r\nand maintain all that it should enact. All the powers of\r\nParliament were thus usurped by this committee. Private vexations\r\nwere added to this general usurpation; in spite of the amnesty\r\nwhich had been proclaimed, even by the last Parliament, Richard\r\ncontinued to wreak his vengeance upon the adherents of the\r\nParliament of 1388. He extorted money from seventeen counties\r\nunder the pretence that they had taken part in the rebellion; and\r\nhe forced wealthy citizens to sign blank cheques in order to\r\nransom themselves from prosecutions for treason, which blanks he\r\nfilled up at his pleasure.\r\n\r\n{506}\r\n              Death Of Richard II.\r\n\r\nSuch acts as these could not fail to produce general hatred and\r\nindignation; and an accidental cause led to their manifestation.\r\nA quarrel existed between the Dukes of Hereford and Norfolk; and\r\nthe last Parliament had left the dispute to the decision of the\r\nking and his committee. A single combat between the two dukes was\r\nappointed to take place at Coventry; but the king anticipated the\r\nduel, and banished both the dukes, one for ten years, and the\r\nother for life. By letters patent, he expressedly authorized the\r\nDuke of Hereford to sue, during his banishment, for the livery of\r\nany lands that might be bequeathed to him. In 1399, John of\r\nGaunt, Duke of Lancaster and father of Hereford, died. The king\r\nand his committee annulled the letters-patent, and confiscated\r\nthe property of the Duke of Lancaster. Richard then set out for\r\nIreland. On the 4th of July, 1399, the Duke of Hereford, who had\r\nbecome Duke of Lancaster by the death of his father, landed in\r\nEngland. He made rapid progress, and when Richard returned to\r\nEngland, he soon found himself abandoned and taken prisoner. A\r\nParliament was convoked in his name on the 30th of September.\r\nRichard abdicated. An accusation in thirty-three articles was\r\ndrawn up against him; and his deposition was pronounced by the\r\nParliament. Henry of Lancaster claimed the crown in virtue of a\r\npretended right of birth. It was granted to him on the 6th of\r\nAugust, 1399, and new writs were issued for the convocation of a\r\nParliament within six days. This was impossible: so the same\r\nParliament met again, and became the Parliament of Henry IV.\r\nRichard, who had been kept prisoner in Pomfret Castle, was put to\r\ndeath on the 23rd of October, 1399.\r\n\r\nThis royal catastrophe was the work of force, just as the\r\ndeposition of Edward II. had been; but public opinion and public\r\npassion had a much greater share in it. Efforts were made to\r\nimpart even to these acts of violence an appearance of\r\nconstitutional regularity, and the progress of parliamentary\r\ngovernment may be discerned even in its tragical excitements.\r\n\r\n{507}\r\n\r\n              The Houses Recover Their Strength.\r\n\r\nSuch were, in a political point of view, the character and\r\nprogress of this reign. A few particular facts are worthy of\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\n  1. The extension of the practice of forced loans. In 1378, a\r\n  petition was presented that no man should be constrained to\r\n  lend money to the king; and it was granted. Nevertheless, in\r\n  1386, a writ addressed to several inhabitants of Boston enjoins\r\n  them to make every person possessing property of more than\r\n  twenty pounds in value contribute to the loan of £200 which the\r\n  town had promised to grant to the king, and which would be\r\n  received in deduction from the subsidies of the present\r\n  Parliament.\r\n\r\n  2. The principle of the appropriation of subsidies becomes\r\n  increasingly prevalent.\r\n\r\n  3. The Commons make efforts to ensure that their petitions\r\n  should not be altered when passed into statutes. In 1382, they\r\n  requested the communication of one of the king's ordinances\r\n  before it was registered: and desired that some of their\r\n  members should be present during the preparation of the rolls.\r\n  The affair of Thomas Haxey gives us reason to believe that the\r\n  practice commenced, during this reign, of proceeding in the\r\n  form of bills discussed and adopted by both Houses before they\r\n  were submitted for the sanction of the king. Nevertheless, in\r\n  1382, the House of Commons having requested the opinion of the\r\n  House of Lords on a question which then occupied their\r\n  attention, the Lords replied that ancient usage required that\r\n  the Commons should first communicate their opinion to the king\r\n  and assembled lords. This very fact, however, proves that the\r\n  present form of initiative was about to introduce itself.\r\n\r\n  4. In 1384, the town of Shaftesbury addressed a petition to the\r\n  king, lords and commons, against the sheriff of Dorsetshire,\r\n  who had made a false return of an election, and left out the\r\n  name of the person really elected. We are not aware of the\r\n  result of this petition, but this is the first instance of the\r\n  official intervention of the Commons in the matter of contested\r\n  elections. Only three examples of analogous petitions are to be\r\n  met with in previous times, viz. under Edward II. in 1319,\r\n  under Edward III. in 1363, and under Richard II. in 1384. Until\r\n  then, the king alone had examined the petition, and referred\r\n  its judgment to the ordinary tribunals.\r\n\r\n  5. In 1382, a statute ordains, under penalty of fine or other\r\n  punishment, that all the lords and deputies of the Commons\r\n  shall repair to Parliament when they are summoned; and that all\r\n  the sheriffs shall cause all due and accustomed elections to be\r\n  made, without omitting any borough or city.\r\n\r\n{508}\r\n\r\n              Progress Of Liberty.\r\n\r\nThese particular acts, as well as the general course of events,\r\nattest the progress of constitutional maxims and practices.\r\n\r\n{509}\r\n\r\n                 Lecture XXV.\r\n\r\n  Summary of the history of the Parliament from the death of\r\n  Richard II. to the accession of the House of Stuart.\r\n\r\n  Progress of the forms of procedure, and of the privileges of\r\n  Parliament.\r\n\r\n  Liberty of speech in both Houses.\r\n\r\n  Inviolability of members of Parliament.\r\n\r\n  Judicial power of the House of Lords.\r\n\r\n  Decadence of the Parliament during the wars of the Roses, and\r\n  under the Tudor dynasty.\r\n\r\n  Causes of this decadence and of the progress of royal\r\n  authority, from Henry VII. to Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n  Conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              The Tudors And Stuarts.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to comprehend the entire scope of the character\r\nand influence of great events. Some occurrences, which procure\r\norder and liberty for the present, prepare the way for tyranny\r\nand confusion in the future; while others, on the contrary,\r\nestablish absolute power at first, and subsequently give birth to\r\nfull political freedom. We cannot fail to be struck by this\r\nreflection when we consider the prodigious difference which\r\nexists between the immediate results and the remote consequences\r\nof the deposition of Richard II. It delivered England from an\r\narbitrary, insolent, and disorderly government; but sixty years\r\nafterwards it gave rise to the wars of the Red and White Roses,\r\nand to all those cruel internal distractions which facilitated\r\nthe establishment of the Tudor despotism: so that the decay of\r\nEnglish liberties, from 1461 to 1640, had its primary source in\r\nthe event which, in 1399, had consummated their triumph.\r\n\r\nIn considering the general character of the state of the\r\ngovernment from 1399 to 1461, under the first three kings of the\r\nHouse of Lancaster, Henry IV., Henry V., and Henry VI., we must\r\nadmit that this period was remarkable neither for the\r\nunchangeableness nor for the progress of institutions. During\r\nthis epoch, the Parliament gained none of those signal victories\r\nwhich distinguished the reigns of Edward III. and Richard II.; no\r\nreally new right, no fundamental and previously unknown\r\nguarantee, were added to those already possessed.\r\n\r\n{510}\r\n\r\n              Improvement Of Parliament.\r\n\r\nNeither did arbitrary power again assume the offensive, and\r\nobtain the advantage; and the crown and Parliament engaged in no\r\nserious conflict calculated to compromise the existence of either\r\nparty, or notably to change their degree of political importance.\r\nIn truth, the work of this period was to regularize the results\r\nof previous struggles. The Parliament exercised, without much\r\nopposition, the right for which it had fought during the\r\nfourteenth century, viz., the voting of taxes, the appropriation\r\nof the subsidies, the investigation of the public accounts,\r\nintervention in the legislature, and the impeachment of the great\r\nofficers of the crown. The kings, though frequently seeking to\r\nelude the application of these rights, never ignored them\r\ncompletely, or braved them openly. The whole of the political\r\nmachine remained almost unaltered; but though it underwent no\r\ngreat revolutions, it received many important developments in its\r\ninternal organization. Practical ameliorations were sought after\r\nand attained; further consequences were deduced from established\r\nprinciples; and this epoch is more remarkable for various\r\nimprovements in the springs of parliamentary government, than for\r\nthe conquest of great rights, or the formation of fundamental\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nThe internal constitution of the Parliament, especially during\r\nthe course of this period, made important progress; from this\r\ntime we may date, with some degree of accuracy, its principal\r\nforms of procedure and its most essential privileges.\r\n\r\nOne of the most essential is, certainly, liberty of speech.\r\nDuring the reign of Henry IV., we find the speaker of the House\r\nof Commons demanding it of the king at the opening of every\r\nsession. One of the first acts of the first Parliament held\r\nduring this reign, in 1399, was to obtain the revocation of the\r\nsentence passed upon Thomas Haxey, in the reign of Richard II.\r\nEvery circumstance proves that, under Henry IV., the Commons used\r\ngreater liberty of speech than they had previously enjoyed. It\r\nwas, indeed, made a subject of special praise to Sir John\r\nTibetot, speaker in the Parliament of 1406. The king soon\r\nmanifested great distrust of the extension given to this right,\r\nwhich was probably exercised with all the rudeness which\r\ncharacterized the manners of that time.\r\n\r\n{511}\r\n\r\n         First Opposition To Liberty Of Speech.\r\n\r\nIn 1410, he told the Commons that he hoped that they would no\r\nlonger use unbecoming language, but act with moderation. In 1411,\r\nthe speaker, Sir Thomas Chaucer, having made the usual demand at\r\nthe opening of the session, the king replied that he would allow\r\nthe Commons to speak as others before had done, but that \"he\r\nwould have no novelties introduced, and would enjoy his\r\nprerogative.\" The speaker requested three days to give a written\r\nanswer to this observation, and then replied \"that he desired no\r\nother protestation than what other speakers had made; and that if\r\nhe should speak anything to the king's displeasure, it might be\r\nimputed to his own ignorance only, and not to the body of the\r\nCommons,\" [Footnote 53] which the king granted.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 53: Parliamentary History, vol.i. p. 313.]\r\n\r\nWe meet with no infringement upon the liberty of speech enjoyed\r\nby the Commons until the Parliament of 1455, at which time a\r\ndeputy from Bristol, Thomas Young, complained that he had been\r\narrested and imprisoned in the Tower, six years before, on\r\naccount of a motion which he had brought forward in the House.\r\nThe object of this motion had been to declare that, as the king\r\nthen had no children, the Duke of York was the legitimate heir to\r\nthe throne. The Commons transmitted this petition to the Lords,\r\nand the king commanded his council to do whatever might be judged\r\nfitting on behalf of the petitioner.\r\n\r\nIn all official transactions with the king and the lords, the\r\nSpeaker was the mouthpiece of the House of Commons, and for him\r\nespecially liberty of speech was then demanded. He acted in the\r\nname, and on the behalf, of the House, on almost all occasions.\r\nIn 1406, we find him giving his consent, in this capacity, to the\r\nact which regulated the succession of the crown.\r\n\r\n{512}\r\n              Imprisonment Of The Speaker.\r\n\r\nThe inviolability of the members of Parliament was a right of no\r\nless importance than liberty of speech. The ancient Saxon laws\r\ngranted protection and security to the members of the\r\nWittenagemot, in going and returning from the place of meeting,\r\nprovided they were not notorious robbers and brigands. From the\r\nformation of the new Parliament, the same right was claimed by\r\nits members, who, as they came to transact the business of the\r\nking in his national council, were entitled to exemption from\r\narrest or hindrance. In 1403, Sir Thomas Brooke repaired to\r\nParliament as a representative of Somersetshire; and one of his\r\nsuite, Richard Cheddre, was maltreated and beaten by John Salage.\r\nA statute ordained that Salage should pay double damages to\r\nCheddre, according to the award of the Court of Queen's Bench;\r\nand \"moreover, it is granted by the said Parliament that the same\r\nshall be done in times to come, in similar cases.\" This\r\ncircumstance gave rise to a petition of the Commons, who prayed\r\nthat all lords, knights, citizens, and burgesses, coming to\r\nParliament and residing there, might be, as well as their\r\nfollowers and domestics, under the special protection and defence\r\nof the king, until their return home; and that they might be\r\narrested for no debt, contract, or suit, or imprisoned in any\r\nmanner during that time, under penalty of a fine to be paid to\r\nthe king, and damages to the person injured. The king replied\r\nthat provision should be made to this effect. The statute of 1403\r\nwas renewed in 1433, during the reign of Henry VI.\r\n\r\nIn 1430, a complaint was laid before the House of Commons on\r\naccount of the imprisonment, for debt, of William Lake, the\r\nservant of William Mildred, one of the members for London. He was\r\nset at liberty by a special act of Parliament.\r\n\r\nIn 1453, the Commons complained to the king and to the lords of\r\nthe imprisonment of Thomas Thorpe, their speaker, who had been\r\narrested for debt at the suit of the Duke of York. The Lords\r\nreferred the matter to the judges, who replied through Sir John\r\nFortescue: \"That it was not their part to judge of the\r\nParliament's actions, who were judges and makers of the laws\r\nthemselves; only they said there were divers _supersedeas_\r\nof privilege of Parliament brought into courts; but a general\r\n_supersedeas_, to suppress all proceedings, there was not.\r\nFor, if there should, it would seem as if the High Court of\r\nParliament, that ministered all justice and equity, should hinder\r\nthe process of the common law, and so put the party complainant\r\nwithout remedy, inasmuch as actions at common law are not\r\ndeterminable in Parliament; but if any member of Parliament be\r\narrested for such cases as are not for treason, felony, or surety\r\nof the peace, or for a judgment had before Parliament, it was\r\nusual for such person to be quitted of such arrest, and set at\r\nliberty to attend his service in Parliament.\" [Footnote 54]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 54: Parliamentary or Constitutional History of\r\n    England, vol. ii. p. 287.]\r\n\r\n{513}\r\n                   Conflicting Opinions.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this answer of the judges, the Lords decided that\r\nThorpe should remain in prison: and ordered the Commons, in the\r\nking's name, to elect another speaker, which they did. But this\r\nwas a party quarrel; Thorpe was attached to the House of\r\nLancaster, and the Duke of York was then in the ascendant. The\r\nprivilege then existed, but still in a precarious manner, and a\r\nspecial act of Parliament was necessary on every occasion to\r\nensure its being put into practice.\r\n\r\nIt was also during this period that the right of parliamentary\r\ninitiative superseded the right of petition. We have already\r\nnoticed the abuses originated by the initiative which the House\r\nof Commons exercised by means of its petitions; and that the\r\npetitions were not always faithfully reproduced in the statutes\r\nwhich they had suggested. We have also seen what efforts had\r\nalready been put forth by the Commons to prevent these\r\ntrickeries. In 1414, during the reign of Henry V., they\r\ncomplained of them in a special petition, to which the king\r\nreplied by promising that in future the statutes should\r\ncorrespond exactly to the petitions granted. But this guarantee\r\nwas very insecure, and the Commons had already begun to obtain\r\nmore effectual securities by accustoming themselves to draw up in\r\nthe form of complete bills, the statutes which they had\r\npreviously suggested by petitions; and sending them to the House\r\nof Lords, that they might be discussed and adopted by that House,\r\nbefore they were presented to the king, who then had nothing more\r\nto do than to give or refuse his sanction. It is impossible to\r\nindicate with precision the period at which this important change\r\ntook place; for it was accomplished gradually, and was not\r\nremarked by the historians of the time. The usage of petitions\r\nco-existed for some time with that of bills. The following facts\r\nindicate the progress of the change. Under Richard II., in 1382\r\n(and I have already alluded to this fact), the Commons attempted\r\nto obtain the opinion of the Lords, upon a certain question,\r\nbefore bringing under the notice of the king.\r\n\r\n{514}\r\n         Clearer Regulations Of The Parliament..\r\n\r\nThe attempt was repulsed by the Lords, who staked their honour\r\nupon not separating from the king, and upon receiving\r\nsimultaneously and in concert with him, the propositions of the\r\nCommons. The complete initiative of the Houses of Parliament\r\narose, naturally and necessarily, from the voting of taxes.\r\nOriginally, as you have seen, each class of deputies voted alone\r\nthose taxes which were destined to weigh especially up on\r\nthemselves; and the knights of the shire deliberated and voted\r\nupon this matter with the Lords. When the knights of the shire\r\nhad fully combined with the deputies of the boroughs--when the\r\nHouse of Commons deliberated and voted, in a body, upon the same\r\ntaxes--it became necessary that the votes on such matters should\r\nreceive the consent of the Lords, who would also have to bear the\r\nconsequences. Bills passed in reference to subsidies were\r\nthenceforward discussed and voted by both Houses before they were\r\nlaid before the king; and the initiative, in its present form,\r\nwas thus fully established in this particular case. In 1407, a\r\nremarkable incident brought this form of proceeding to light,\r\ngave it final sanction, and deduced from it at the same time two\r\nother parliamentary rights of great importance. In consequence of\r\na debate which arose between the House of Lords and the House of\r\nCommons with regard to the initiative of subsidies, three\r\nprinciples were recognised, and have since remained firmly\r\nestablished:\r\n\r\n  1. Parliamentary initiative in its present form;\r\n\r\n  2. The exclusive initiative of the Commons in the matter of\r\n  subsidies;\r\n\r\n  3. The right of the Houses, that the king should take no\r\n  cognizance of the subject of their deliberations until they had\r\n  come to a decision upon it, and were in a position to lay it\r\n  before him as the desire of the Lords and Commons in Parliament\r\n  assembled.\r\n\r\nIt was natural that that which was practised with regard to\r\nsubsidies should soon extend to all matters; and that the\r\npropositions of Parliament, whatever might be their object,\r\nshould reach the king as emanating from both Houses instead of\r\nbeing merely the petitions of one of them. Mr. Hallam affirms,\r\nwithout giving any particulars, that this practice became general\r\nduring the reign of Henry VI., and from this period he dates the\r\nreal division of the legislature into three branches. I am\r\ninclined to think that this practice had commenced at an earlier\r\ndate, although it was rarely carried into effect; and it is\r\ncertain, from the very constitution of Parliament at this epoch,\r\nthat it did not become constant and general until a later period.\r\n\r\n{515}\r\n\r\nIn 1406, I find the Commons demanding, by the mouth of the\r\nspeaker, Sir John Tibetot, the right of withdrawing their bills\r\nfrom the House of Lords, at any stage of the deliberation upon\r\nthem, in order to introduce amendments; which was granted. The\r\nCommons were therefore already in the habit of occasionally\r\ndrawing up their petitions in the form of bills, and of passing\r\nthem through the House of Lords before presenting them to the\r\nking.\r\n\r\nAt this period, the House of Lords was still regarded as the\r\ngreat council of the king, and as a sort of intermediary between\r\nthe privy council and the entire Parliament; and a number of\r\npropositions on matters of government, and even of legislation,\r\nstill emanated from the Commons alone, and were presented, in the\r\nform of petitions, to the king and lords. The practice of\r\ninitiative by way of bills adopted by both Houses could not,\r\ntherefore, have been general. The periods of the king's minority\r\nor absence tended increasingly to impart the character of a great\r\ncouncil of government to the House of Lords. Accordingly these\r\nepochs, and especially the reign of Henry VI., abound in\r\npropositions or petitions of the Commons to the Lords. It was at\r\na later period, when the king and his privy council had regained\r\na more independent power than their predecessors had enjoyed\r\n--that is to say, under the Tudor dynasty--that the Upper House\r\nbecame entirely disjoined from the government properly so called,\r\nand found itself placed, with respect to the king, in almost the\r\nsame position as the House of Commons. Then alone did the\r\npractice of proceeding by bills discussed in both Houses before\r\nthey were laid before the king, assume a constant and general\r\ncharacter, that is to say, the parliamentary initiative was\r\ndefinitively substituted for the ancient right of petition\r\npossessed by each House, and especially by the Commons.\r\n\r\n{516}\r\n              Votes Of Subsidy.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the order of the debates in Parliament, it was an\r\nancient custom that the king should not reply to the petitions of\r\nthe Commons until the last day of the session; which rendered it\r\nimpossible to make the concession of subsidies dependent upon the\r\nking's answers. They endeavoured to reverse this order, probably\r\nduring the reign of Richard II.; for the sixth question which he\r\nproposed to the judges was whether, when the king had called the\r\nattention of Parliament to any subject, the Parliament might\r\nattend to other matters before deciding upon the propositions of\r\nthe king. The judges replied that such a proceeding was an act of\r\ntreason. The answers of the judges of Richard II. having been\r\ndeclared illegitimate in the Parliament of 1399, the foregoing\r\n_dictum_ was comprised in the general reprobation.\r\nAccordingly, in 1401, the Commons maintained that it was not\r\ntheir custom to grant any subsidy until the king had replied to\r\ntheir petitions, and they demanded that this course should be\r\npursued. The king said that he would confer on the subject with\r\nthe Lords, and on the last day of the session, he replied \"that\r\nthere was never such use known, but that they should first go\r\nthrough with all other business before their petitions were\r\nanswered; which ordinance the king intended not to alter.\" We do\r\nnot find that the Commons then resisted, or attempted to procure\r\nthe recognition, in a general manner, of the principle which they\r\nasserted. But this principle was frequently put into practice in\r\nsubsequent Parliaments, and the king was forced not to throw any\r\nhindrance in its way. In 1407, Parliament opened on the 20th of\r\nOctober. On the 9th and 14th of November, the Commons presented\r\nthemselves before the king, explained their numerous grievances,\r\nreceived his answer, and granted no subsidies until the 2nd of\r\nDecember following. In 1410, Parliament met on the 27th of\r\nJanuary; and it was not until the 9th of May, after it had\r\nobtained satisfaction on several points, among others on the\r\ndismissal of two members of the privy council, that it granted a\r\nsubsidy. This practice became almost constant during the reign of\r\nHenry VI. We find an evident proof of this in the Parliament held\r\nin November 1455. The Commons sent several times to demand of the\r\nLords the appointment of a Protector for the kingdom, on account\r\nof the imbecility of Henry VI.; and the Archbishop of Canterbury\r\nurged the Lords to give a definitive answer, \"for it is well\r\nknown that the Commons will not give attention to any affairs of\r\nthe Parliament until they have obtained an answer, and\r\nsatisfaction of their request.\"\r\n\r\n{517}\r\n\r\n              Judicial Powers Of The Lords.\r\n\r\nThe principle had, therefore, become a fact, and was generally\r\nadmitted as a fact.\r\n\r\nIt was also during the course of this period that elections to\r\nParliament, and the rights of Parliament in the matter of\r\nelections, began to be regulated. I have already observed in\r\ntreating of the formation of the Parliament, that the electoral\r\nsystem had been definitively established by statutes of Henry IV.\r\nin 1405, and of Henry VI. in 1429 and 1432. Many facts prove that\r\nat this date the importance of the House of Commons had become so\r\ngreat; that the elections were a subject of frequent frauds. A\r\nnumber of statutes of detail, during the reign of Henry VI., were\r\npassed to prevent such frauds, and to regulate the procedure by\r\nwhich they should be investigated and punished. Then also, for\r\nthe first time, we find conditions imposed on the choice of the\r\nelectors. The ancient spirit of electoral institutions required\r\nthat the persons elected should be inhabitants of the county or\r\ntown which they were chosen to represent. This was converted into\r\nan express law by a statute of Henry V. in 1413, which was\r\nrenewed by a statute of Henry VI., in 1444; but the law has\r\nfallen into desuetude by the force of circumstances, without ever\r\nhaving been formally repealed.\r\n\r\nThe judgment of elections continued to belong, during this\r\nperiod, to the lords and the king's council, who were frequently\r\nurged to exercise this prerogative by petitions from the Commons.\r\n\r\nIt was also at this epoch that the judicial power, which\r\noriginally resided in the entire Parliament, was declared to\r\nbelong exclusively to the House of Lords. This declaration was\r\nmade in 1399, at the suggestion of the Commons themselves, and by\r\nthe mouth of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who said: \"That the\r\nCommons were only petitioners, and that all judgment belonged to\r\nthe king and lords; unless it was in statutes, grants of\r\nsubsidies, and such like.\" Since this period the Commons, when\r\nthey desired to interfere in judgments otherwise than by\r\nimpeachment, were obliged to employ the means of bills of\r\nattainder. They adopted this plan in the case of the Duke of\r\nSuffolk in 1450, and very frequently afterwards.\r\n\r\n{518}\r\n              Resistance To The Commons.\r\n\r\nThese are the most notable marks of progress made, during this\r\nperiod, by the constitution and forms of Parliament. If we now\r\nconsider Parliament, no longer in itself and its own internal\r\nproceedings, but in its relations to the government properly so\r\ncalled, we shall find that its rights and influence in matters of\r\ntaxation, legislation, and public administration were the same as\r\nit had won under Edward III. and Richard II., and that it merely\r\nexercised them with greater assurance and less opposition. Henry\r\nIV. tried more than once to resist the power of the House of\r\nCommons; but it had set him upon the throne, and felt itself in a\r\nposition to confine him within the limit of his authority. In\r\n1404, it demanded of him the dismissal of four officers of his\r\nhousehold; and he replied with singular humility \"that he knew no\r\ncause why they should be removed, but as the Lords and Commons\r\njudged it for the interest of the kingdom and his own advantage,\r\nhe would remove them, and would do as much in future to any\r\nminister who should incur the hatred of his people.\" In 1406, the\r\nCommons submitted for the approbation of the king thirty articles\r\nwhich, they said, they had drawn up to ensure the better\r\nadministration of public affairs, and which they demanded that\r\nthe king's officers should swear to observe. These articles,\r\nthough of a temporary nature, were intended to repress many\r\nexisting abuses, and to restrict the royal prerogative in certain\r\nrespects. The king thought that he could not refuse his assent.\r\nTowards the end of his reign, Henry IV. appeared more bold, and\r\nless disposed to yield unresistingly to the control of the\r\nParliament; but his death prevented all serious conflict. The\r\nglory of Henry V. and the passion for wars with France filled up\r\nhis somewhat brief reign; the Parliament sustained him in all his\r\nmeasures, and even went so far as to grant him, in 1415, a\r\nsubsidy for life, with power to use it arbitrarily and at his\r\npleasure. During the minority of Henry VI., or rather during all\r\nthat part of his reign which was not stained with civil war, and\r\nwas in fact a long minority, the power of Parliament reached its\r\nclimax, and absorbed the entire government. All matters were\r\ndecided between the Lords and Commons; but it was too soon for\r\nthe nation, thus left to its own guidance, to provide itself with\r\na regular government. Violent factions arose among the\r\naristocracy, which the House of Commons was not in a condition to\r\nrepress. That great development of public institutions and\r\nliberties which had commenced under king John, and continued with\r\nsuch regularity since the reign of Edward III., was suddenly\r\ninterrupted, and England plunged into the violent anarchy of the\r\nwars of the Red and White Roses, to emerge only into the\r\ndespotism of the House of Tudor.\r\n\r\n{519}\r\n\r\n              Review Of The State Of Europe.\r\n\r\nHow came it that institutions, already so strong and active, at\r\nleast in appearance, decayed so rapidly? How came it that\r\nparliamentary government, which seemed in possession of all its\r\nessential rights and principles, paused in its progress, and\r\nyielded for more than a century to the rule of an almost absolute\r\nmonarchy? Now that I have reached the conclusion of this course\r\nof lectures, I cannot investigate with you the causes of this\r\napparently singular fact; but they may be discerned in another\r\nvery remarkable fact in the analogy which prevails between the\r\nhistory of England and the history of France at this period. In\r\nFrance, also, during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, we\r\ndiscern the appearances of attempts at representative government;\r\nthese incoherent and superficial essays were succeeded by the\r\nwars of religion, the League, and the great disorders of the\r\nsixteenth century; and order was not restored, France did not\r\nregain repose and vigour, until the establishment of absolute\r\npower by Cardinal Richelieu and Louis XIV., and by the\r\nannihilation, as a political power, of that ancient feudal\r\naristocracy who had been able neither to procure for the country,\r\nnor to assume for themselves, in the government of France, their\r\nlegitimate and lasting position.\r\n\r\nIn England, as you have just seen, representative government,\r\noriginating in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, did not\r\nconfine itself to incoherent and feeble essays; but established\r\nitself upon its essential foundations, and speedily obtained\r\nconsiderable development. The sanguinary conflicts for the\r\nsuccession to the throne, the protracted dissensions of the Red\r\nand White Roses, abruptly arrested its progress. Just as in\r\nFrance, from the reign of Louis XI., we hear nothing of attempts\r\nat the establishment of free institutions, so in England, during\r\nthe reigns of Edward IV. and Richard III., the Parliament has no\r\nhistory.\r\n{520}\r\nIn the intervals of the civil war, it appears only as the\r\ninstrument of the vengeance of the victorious party, and to pass\r\nbills of attainder against the leaders of the vanquished faction.\r\nIt voted a few taxes, but this was the only one of its rights\r\nwhich, it still maintained, and even this was eluded by the\r\npractice of _Benevolences_, or gifts in appearance\r\nvoluntary, but in reality compulsory, of which we meet with a few\r\nexamples in antecedent times, but which received great extension\r\nunder Edward IV. Finally, more than once several years elapsed\r\nwithout a Parliament being convoked, especially from 1477 to\r\n1482; such a suspension had been unprecedented since 1327.\r\n\r\nThe civil wars of the fifteenth century, however, are only the\r\nsuperficial, and as it were, external cause of this sudden\r\ndecadence of representative government in England; in order to\r\ndiscover its true cause, we must penetrate deeper into the state\r\nof society.\r\n\r\nUntil this period, the three great forces in English society\r\n--the royal power, the aristocracy, and the Commons--had\r\nmaintained intimate and continual relations amongst themselves,\r\nand had served each other by turns, either as an obstacle or as a\r\nmeans of success. It was by the aid of the great barons that the\r\nCommons had been enabled to win their liberties. The royal power,\r\nthough strong in itself, had nevertheless been obliged to resort\r\nsometimes to the barons, and sometimes to the Commons. From the\r\npolitical concurrence of these three great social forces, and\r\nfrom the vicissitudes of their alliances and fortunes, the\r\nprogress of representative government had resulted. Liberty can\r\nbe established only where there does not exist in the State any\r\nconstituted power sufficiently preponderant to usurp absolute\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nIn the latter half of the fifteenth century, the equipoise of\r\nthese three forces ceased. The royal power disappeared in some\r\nsort, in consequence of the imbecility of Henry VI. and\r\nafterwards by the uncertainty of the right of succession to the\r\ncrown. The government fell into the hands of the high\r\naristocracy, who were divided and distracted by their intestine\r\nquarrels. The Commons were not in a condition to act the part of\r\nmediators between these terrible factions, and to impose upon\r\nthem respect for public order.\r\n{521}\r\nThe knights of the shire took part in the train of the great\r\nbarons with whom they were still dependently connected by a\r\nmultitude of ties: and the towns, thus left alone, could do\r\nnothing, but were carried away in the general stream. In this\r\nstate of disorder and violence, the Commons disappeared, or if\r\nthey were not materially annihilated, their political power\r\nvanished. The high aristocracy worked its own dissolution; many\r\ngreat families were destroyed, and many more were ruined. Henry\r\nVII., at his accession, found only the wreck of that nobility\r\nwhich had made his predecessors tremble. The great barons,\r\nwearied with their own excesses, and stripped of a great part of\r\ntheir resources, were no longer inclined or able to continue that\r\nstruggle against the royal power, which had been headed by their\r\nancestors ever since the days of king John. On this side\r\ntherefore, the royal power no longer had any powerful\r\nantagonists. On the other side, the Commons, wasted and enervated\r\nby civil war, were not in a condition to take the place of the\r\nhigh aristocracy in the struggle against the royal authority.\r\nThey had taken part in the government as followers of the nobles;\r\nand when they found themselves standing almost alone in presence\r\nof the crown, it did not even occur to them that this\r\ninterference was their right: they, therefore, contented\r\nthemselves with defending a few special rights, particularly that\r\nof consenting to large subsidies; and, in other respects, they\r\nallowed themselves to be governed. Hence arose the government of\r\nHenry VIII., and at a later period, that of Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nMore than a century was requisite to enable the English\r\nCommons--re-invigorated and strengthened, in a material point of\r\nview, by long years of order and prosperity, and in a moral point\r\nof view, by the reformation of religion--to acquire sufficient\r\nsocial importance and intellectual elevation to place themselves,\r\nin their turn, at the head of the resistance against despotism,\r\nand to draw the ancient aristocracy in their train. This great\r\nrevolution in the state of society broke out in the reign of\r\nCharles I., and determined that political revolution, which,\r\nafter fifty years of conflict, finally established representative\r\ngovernment in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   The End.\r\n\r\n{522}\r\n\r\n{523}\r\n                    INDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActs of the Oxford Parliament, 357\r\n\r\nAdalid
