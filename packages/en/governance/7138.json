It was not, however, until\r\nthe following year that definite action may be said to have commenced in\r\nCongress toward that end; and, as Congress was slow, he found it\r\nnecessary to say in his third Annual Message: \"while I remain in my\r\npresent position I shall not attempt to retract or modify the\r\nEmancipation Proclamation; nor shall I return to Slavery any person who\r\nis Free by the terms of that Proclamation, or by any of the Acts of\r\nCongress,\"\r\n\r\nMeantime, however, occurred the series of glorious\r\nUnion victories in the West, ending with the surrender to Grant's\r\ntriumphant Forces on the 4th of July, 1863, of Vicksburg--\"the Gibraltar\r\nof the West\"--with its Garrison, Army, and enormous quantities of arms\r\nand munitions of war; thus closing a brilliant and successful Campaign\r\nwith a blow which literally \"broke the back\" of the Rebellion; while,\r\nalmost simultaneously, July 1-3, the Union Forces of the East, under\r\nMeade, gained the great victory of Gettysburg, and, driving the hosts of\r\nLee from Pennsylvania, put a second and final end to Rebel invasion of\r\nNorthern soil; gaining it, on ground dedicated by President Lincoln,\r\nbefore that year had closed--as a place of sepulture for the\r\nPatriot-soldiers who there had fallen in a brief, touching and immortal\r\nAddress, which every American child should learn by heart, and every\r\nAmerican adult ponder deeply, as embodying the very essence of true\r\nRepublicanism.\r\n\r\n     [President Lincoln's Address, when the National Cemetery at\r\n     Gettysburg, Pa., was dedicated Nov.  19, 1863, was in these\r\n     memorable words:\r\n\r\n     \"Fourscore and seven years ago, our Fathers brought forth upon this\r\n     continent a new Nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the\r\n     proposition that all men are created equal.\r\n\r\n     \"Now we are engaged in a great Civil War, testing whether that\r\n     Nation, or any Nation, so conceived and so dedicated, can long\r\n     endure.\r\n\r\n     \"We are met on a great battlefield of that War.  We have come here\r\n     to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting-place for\r\n     those who here gave their lives that that Nation might live.\r\n\r\n     \"It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.\r\n\r\n     \"But in a larger sense, we can not dedicate, we can not consecrate,\r\n     we can not hallow, this ground.  The brave men, living and dead,\r\n     who struggled here, have consecrated it far above our power to add\r\n     or detract.\r\n\r\n     \"The World will little note, nor long remember, what we say here;\r\n     but it can never forget what they did here.\r\n\r\n     \"It is for us, the living, rather to be dedicated here to the\r\n     unfinished work which they who fought here have, thus far, so nobly\r\n     advanced.\r\n\r\n     \"It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task\r\n     remaining before us; that from these honored dead we take increased\r\n     devotion to that Cause for which they gave the last full measure of\r\n     devotion; that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not\r\n     have died in vain; that this Nation, under God, shall have a new\r\n     birth of Freedom; and that Government of the People, by the People,\r\n     and for the People, shall not perish front the Earth.\"]\r\n\r\nThat season of victory for the Union arms, coming, as it did, upon a\r\nseason of depression and doubtfulness, was doubly grateful to the loyal\r\nheart of the Nation.  Daylight seemed to be breaking at last.\r\nGettysburg had hurled back the Southern invader from our soil; and\r\nVicksburg, with the immediately resulting surrender of Port Hudson, had\r\nopened the Mississippi river from Cairo to the Gulf, and split the\r\nConfederacy in twain.\r\n\r\nBut it happened just about this time that, the enrollment of the whole\r\nMilitia of the United States (under the Act of March, 1863), having been\r\ncompleted, and a Draft for 300,000 men ordered to be made and executed,\r\nif by a subsequent time the quotas of the various States should not be\r\nfilled by volunteering, certain malcontents and Copperheads, inspired by\r\nagents and other friends of the Southern Conspirators, started and\r\nfomented, in the city of New York, a spirit of unreasoning opposition\r\nboth to voluntary enlistment, and conscription under the Draft, that\r\nfinally culminated, July 13th, in a terrible Riot, lasting several days,\r\nduring which that great metropolis was in the hands, and completely at\r\nthe mercy, of a brutal mob of Secession sympathizers, who made day and\r\nnight hideous with their drunken bellowings, terrorized everybody even\r\nsuspected of love for the Union, plundered and burned dwellings,\r\nincluding a Colored Orphan Asylum, and added to the crime of arson, that\r\nof murdering the mob-chased, terror-stricken Negroes, by hanging them to\r\nthe lamp-posts.\r\n\r\nThese Riots constituted a part of that \"Fire in the Rear\" with which the\r\nRebels and their Northern Democratic sympathizers had so frequently\r\nmenaced the Armies of the Union.\r\n\r\nAlluding to them, the N. Y.  Tribune on July 15th, while its office was\r\ninvested and threatened with attack and demolition, bravely said: \"They\r\nare, in purpose and in essence, a Diversion in favor of Jefferson Davis\r\nand Lee.  Listen to the yells of the mob and the harangues of its\r\nfavorite orators, and you will find them surcharged with 'Nigger,'\r\n'Abolition,' 'Black Republican,' denunciation of prominent Republicans,\r\nThe Tribune, etc. etc.--all very wide of the Draft and the exemption.\r\nHad the Abolitionists, instead of the Slaveholders, revolted, and\r\nundertaken to upset the Government and dissolve the Union, nine-tenths\r\nof these rioters would have eagerly volunteered to put them down.  It is\r\nthe fear, stimulated by the recent and glorious triumphs of the Union\r\nArms, that Slavery and the Rebellion must suffer, which is at the bottom\r\nof all this arson, devastation, robbery, and murder.\"\r\n\r\nThe Democratic Governor, Seymour, by promising to \"have this Draft\r\nsuspended and stopped,\" did something toward quieting the Riots, but it\r\nwas not until the Army of the Potomac, now following Lee's retreat, was\r\nweakened by the sending of several regiments to New York that the\r\nDraft-rioting spirit, in that city, and to a less extent in other\r\ncities, was thoroughly cowed.\r\n\r\n     [In reply to Gov. Seymour's appeal for delay in the execution of\r\n     the Draft Law, in order to test its Constitutionality, Mr. Lincoln,\r\n     on the 7th of August, said he could not consent to lose the time\r\n     that would be involved in obtaining a decision from the U. S.\r\n     Supreme Court on that point, and proceeded: \"We are contending with\r\n     an Enemy who, as I understand, drives every able-bodied man he can\r\n     reach into his ranks, very much as a butcher drives bullocks into a\r\n     slaughter-pen.  No time is wasted, no argument is used.\r\n\r\n     \"This system produces an Army which will soon turn upon our now\r\n     victorious soldiers already in the field, if they shall not be\r\n     sustained by recruits as they should be.\r\n\r\n     It produces an Army with a rapidity not to be matched on our side,\r\n     if we first waste time to re-experiment with the Volunteer system,\r\n     already deemed by Congress, and palpably, in fact, so far exhausted\r\n     as to be inadequate; and then more time to obtain a Court decision\r\n     as to whether a law is Constitutional which requires a part of\r\n     those not now in the Service to go to those who are already in it,\r\n     and still more time to determine with absolute certainty that we\r\n     get those who are to go, in the precisely legal proportion to those\r\n     who are not to go.\r\n\r\n     \"My purpose is to be in my action Just and Constitutional, and yet\r\n     Practical, in performing the important duty with which I am\r\n     charged, of maintaining the Unity and the Free principles of our\r\n     common Country.\"]\r\n\r\nWorried and weakened by this Democratic opposition to the Draft, and the\r\nthreatened consequent delays and dangers to the success of the Union\r\nCause, and depressed moreover by the defeat of the National forces under\r\nRosecrans at Chickamauga; yet, the favorable determination of the Fall\r\nelections on the side of Union and Freedom, and the immense majorities\r\nupholding those issues, together with Grant's great victory (November,\r\n1863) of Chattanooga--where the three days of fighting in the\r\nChattanooga Valley and up among the clouds of Lookout Mountain and\r\nMission Ridge, not only effaced the memory of Rosecrans's previous\r\ndisaster, but brought fresh and imperishable laurels to the Union Arms\r\n--stiffened the President's backbone, and that of Union men everywhere.\r\n\r\nNot that Mr. Lincoln had shown any signs of weakness or wavering, or any\r\nloss of hope in the ultimate result of this War for the preservation of\r\nthe Union--which now also involved Freedom to all beneath its banner.\r\nOn the contrary, a letter of his written late in August shows\r\nconclusively enough that he even then began to see clearly the coming\r\nfinal triumph--not perhaps as \"speedy,\" as he would like, in its coming,\r\nbut none the less sure to come in God's \"own good time,\" and furthermore\r\nnot appearing \"to be so distant as it did\" before Gettysburg, and\r\nespecially Vicksburg, was won; for, said he: \"The signs look better.\r\nThe Father of Waters again goes unvexed to the Sea\".\r\n\r\n     [This admirable letter, reviewing \"the situation\" and his policy,\r\n     was in these words\r\n\r\n                         EXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n                    WASHINGTON, August 26.  1863.\r\n\r\n     HON. JAMES C. CONKLING\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SIR; Your letter inviting me to attend a Mass Meeting of\r\n     unconditional Union men to be held at the Capital of Illinois, on\r\n     the 3rd day of September, has been received.  It would be very\r\n     agreeable for me thus to meet my old friends at my own home; but I\r\n     cannot just now be absent from here so long a time as a visit there\r\n     would require.\r\n\r\n     The meeting is to be of all those who maintain unconditional\r\n     devotion to the Union; and I am sure that my old political friends\r\n     will thank me for tendering, as I do, the Nation's gratitude to\r\n     those other noble men whom no partisan malice or partisan hope can\r\n     make false to the Nation's life.\r\n\r\n     There are those who are dissatisfied with me.  To such I would say:\r\n     you desire Peace, and you blame me that we do not have it.  But how\r\n     can we attain it?  There are but three conceivable ways: First, to\r\n     suppress the Rebellion by force of Arms.  This I am trying to do.\r\n     Are you for it?  If you are, so far we are agreed.  If you are not\r\n     for it, a second way is to give up the Union.  I am against this.\r\n     Are you for it?  If you are, you should say so plainly.  If you are\r\n     not for Force, nor yet for Dissolution, there only remains some\r\n     imaginable Compromise.\r\n\r\n     I do not believe that any Compromise embracing the maintenance of\r\n     the Union is now possible.  All that I learn leads to a directly\r\n     opposite belief.  The strength of the Rebellion is its Military,\r\n     its Army.  That Army dominates all the Country, and all the people,\r\n     within its range.  Any offer of terms made by any man or men within\r\n     that range, in opposition to that Army, is simply nothing for the\r\n     present: because such man or men have no power whatever to enforce\r\n     their side of a Compromise, if one were made with them.\r\n\r\n     To illustrate: Suppose refugees from the South, and Peace men of\r\n     the North, get together in Convention, and frame and proclaim a\r\n     Compromise embracing a restoration of the Union.  In what way can\r\n     that Compromise be used to keep Lee's Army out of Pennsylvania?\r\n     Meade's Army can keep Lee's Army out of Pennsylvania, and, I think,\r\n     can ultimately drive it out of existence.  But no paper Compromise\r\n     to which the controllers of Lee's Army are not agreed, can at all\r\n     affect that Army.  In an effort at such Compromise we would waste\r\n     time, which the Enemy would improve to our disadvantage; and that\r\n     would be all.\r\n\r\n     A Compromise, to be effective, must be made either with those who\r\n     control the Rebel Army, or with the people, first liberated from\r\n     the domination of that Army, by the success of our own Army.  Now,\r\n     allow me to assure you that no word or intimation from that Rebel\r\n     Army, or from any of the men controlling it, in relation to any\r\n     Peace Compromise, has ever come to my knowledge or belief.  All\r\n     charges and insinuations to the contrary are deceptive and\r\n     groundless.  And I promise you that if any such proposition shall\r\n     hereafter come, it shall not be rejected and kept a secret from\r\n     you.  I freely acknowledge myself to be the servant of the People,\r\n     according to the bond of service, the United States Constitution;\r\n     and that, as such, I am responsible to them.\r\n\r\n     But, to be plain.  You are dissatisfied with me about the Negro.\r\n     Quite likely there is a difference of opinion between you and\r\n     myself upon that subject.  I certainly wish that all men could be\r\n     Free, while you, I suppose, do not.  Yet I have neither adopted nor\r\n     proposed any measure which is not consistent with even your view,\r\n     provided that you are for the Union.  I suggested compensated\r\n     Emancipation; to which you replied you wished not to be taxed to\r\n     buy Negroes.  But I had not asked you to be taxed to buy Negroes,\r\n     except in such a way as to save you from greater taxation to save\r\n     the Union, exclusively by other means.\r\n\r\n     You dislike the Emancipation Proclamation, and perhaps would have\r\n     it retracted.  You say it is Unconstitutional.  I think\r\n     differently.  I think the Constitution invests the\r\n     Commander-in-Chief with the Law of War in Time of War.  The most\r\n     that can be said, if so much, is, that Slaves are property.  Is\r\n     there, has there ever been, any question that, by the Law of War,\r\n     property, both of enemies and friends, may be taken when needed?\r\n     And is it not needed whenever it helps us and hurts the Enemy?\r\n     Armies, the World over, destroy enemies' property when they cannot\r\n     use it; and even destroy their own to keep it from the Enemy.\r\n     Civilized belligerents do all in their power to help themselves or\r\n     hurt the Enemy, except a few things regarded as barbarous or cruel.\r\n     Among the exceptions are the massacre of vanquished foes and\r\n     non-combatants, male and female.\r\n\r\n     But the Proclamation, as law, either is valid or is not valid.  If\r\n     it is not valid, it needs no retraction.  If it is valid it cannot\r\n     be retracted, any more than the dead can be brought to life.  Some\r\n     of you profess to think its retraction would operate favorably for\r\n     the Union.  Why better after the retraction than before the issue?\r\n     There was more than a year and a half of trial to suppress the\r\n     Rebellion before the Proclamation was issued, the last one hundred\r\n     days of which passed under an explicit notice that it was coming,\r\n     unless averted by those in revolt returning to their allegiance.\r\n     The War has certainly progressed as favorably for us since the\r\n     issue of the Proclamation as before.\r\n\r\n     I know as fully as one can know the opinions of others that some of\r\n     the Commanders of our Armies in the field, who have given us our\r\n     most important victories, believe the Emancipation policy and the\r\n     use of Colored troops constitute the heaviest blows yet dealt to\r\n     the Rebellion, and that at least one of those important successes\r\n     could not have been achieved when it was, but for the aid of Black\r\n     soldiers.\r\n\r\n     Among the Commanders who hold these views are some who have never\r\n     had an affinity with what is called \"Abolitionism,\" or with\r\n     \"Republican party politics,\" but who hold them purely as Military\r\n     opinions.  I submit their opinions as entitled to some weight\r\n     against the objections often urged that Emancipation and arming the\r\n     Blacks are unwise as Military measures, and were not adopted as\r\n     such, in good faith.\r\n\r\n     You say that you will not fight to Free Negroes.  Some of them seem\r\n     willing to fight for you; but no matter.  Fight you, then,\r\n     exclusively to save the Union.  I issued the Proclamation on\r\n     purpose to aid you in saving the Union.  Whenever you shall have\r\n     conquered all resistance to the Union, if I shall urge you to\r\n     continue fighting, it will be an apt time then for you to declare\r\n     you will not fight to Free Negroes.  I thought that in your\r\n     struggle for the Union, to whatever extent the Negroes should cease\r\n     helping the Enemy, to that extent it weakened the Enemy in his\r\n     resistance to you.  Do you think differently?  I thought whatever\r\n     Negroes can be got to do as soldiers, leaves just so much less for\r\n     White soldiers to do in saving the Union.  Does it appear otherwise\r\n     to you?  But Negroes, like other people, act upon motives.  Why\r\n     should they do anything for us if we will do nothing for them?  If\r\n     they stake their lives for us they must be prompted by the\r\n     strongest motives, even the promise of Freedom.  And the promise,\r\n     being made, must be kept.\r\n\r\n     The signs look better.  The Father of Waters again goes unvexed to\r\n     the Sea.  Thanks to the great Northwest for it; nor yet wholly to\r\n     them.  Three hundred miles up, they met New England, Empire,\r\n     Keystone, and Jersey, hewing their way right and left.  The Sunny\r\n     South, too, in more colors than one, also lent a helping hand.  On\r\n     the spot, their part of the history was jotted down in Black and\r\n     White.  The job was a great National one, and let none be slighted\r\n     who bore an honorable part in it.  And while those who have cleared\r\n     the Great River may well be proud, even that is not all.  It is\r\n     hard to say that anything has been more bravely and well done than\r\n     at Antietam, Murfreesboro, Gettysburg, and on many fields of less\r\n     note.  Nor must Uncle Sam's web-feet be forgotten.  At all the\r\n     watery margins they have been present, not only on the deep Sea,\r\n     the broad Bay, and the rapid River, but also up the narrow, muddy\r\n     Bayou, and wherever the ground was a little damp they had been, and\r\n     made their tracks.  Thanks to all.  For the Great Republic--for the\r\n     principle it lives by, and keeps alive--for Man's vast future\r\n     --thanks to all.\r\n\r\n     Peace does not appear so distant as it did.  I hope it will come\r\n     soon, and come to stay; and so come as to be worth the keeping in\r\n     all future time.  It will then have been proved that among Freemen\r\n     there can be no successful appeal from the ballot to the bullet,\r\n     and that they who take such appeal are sure to lose their case and\r\n     pay the cost.  And there will be some Black men who can remember\r\n     that, with silent tongue, and clinched teeth, and steady eye, and\r\n     well poised bayonet, they have helped mankind on to this great\r\n     consummation, while I fear there will be some White ones unable to\r\n     forget that with malignant heart and deceitful speech they have\r\n     striven to hinder it.\r\n\r\n     Still, let us not be over sanguine of a speedy, final triumph.  Let\r\n     us be quite sober.  Let us diligently apply the means, never\r\n     doubting that a just God, in his own good time, will give us the\r\n     rightful result.\r\n\r\n                    Yours very truly,\r\n                                   A. LINCOLN.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Chattanooga, and the grand majorities in all the Fall\r\nState-elections, save that of New Jersey,--and especially the manner\r\nin which loyal Ohio sat down upon the chief Copperhead-Democrat and\r\nTreason-breeder of the North, Vallandigham--came most auspiciously to\r\nstrengthen the President's hands.\r\n\r\n     [The head of the Knights of the Golden Circle, and the Democratic\r\n     candidate for Governor of Ohio]\r\n\r\nAnd now he saw, more clearly still, the approach of that time when the\r\nsolemn promise and declaration of Emancipation might be recorded upon\r\nthe sacred roll of the Constitution, and thus be made safe for all time.\r\n\r\nIn his Annual Message of December, 1863, therefore, President Lincoln,\r\nafter adverting to the fact that \"a year ago the War had already lasted\r\nnearly twenty months,\" without much ground for hopefulness, proceeded to\r\nsay:\r\n\r\n\"The preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, issued in September, was\r\nrunning its assigned period to the beginning of the New Year.  A month\r\nlater the final Proclamation came, including the announcement that\r\nColored men of suitable condition would be received into the War\r\nservice.  The policy of Emancipation, and of employing Black soldiers,\r\ngave to the future a new aspect, about which hope, and fear, and doubt,\r\ncontended in uncertain conflict.\r\n\r\n\"According to our political system, as a matter of Civil Administration,\r\nthe General Government had no lawful power to effect Emancipation in any\r\nState, and for a long time it had been hoped that the Rebellion could be\r\nsuppressed without resorting to it as a Military measure.  It was all\r\nthe while deemed possible that the necessity for it might come, and that\r\nif it should, the crisis of the contest would then be presented.  It\r\ncame, and, as was anticipated, it was followed by dark and doubtful\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\"Eleven months having now passed, we are permitted to take another view\r\n* * * Of those who were Slaves at the beginning of the Rebellion, full\r\none hundred thousand are now in the United States Military service,\r\nabout one half of which number actually bear arms in the ranks; thus\r\ngiving the double advantage of taking so much labor from the Insurgent\r\ncause, and supplying the places which otherwise must be filled with so\r\nmany White men.  So far as tested, it is difficult to say they are not\r\nas good soldiers as any.\r\n\r\n\"No servile insurrection, or tendency to violence or cruelty, has marked\r\nthe measures of Emancipation and arming the Blacks.  These measures have\r\nbeen much discussed in Foreign Countries, and contemporary with such\r\ndiscussion the tone of public sentiment there is much improved.  At\r\nhome, the same measures have been fully discussed, supported,\r\ncriticised, and denounced, and the annual elections following are highly\r\nencouraging to those whose official duty it is to bear the Country\r\nthrough this great trial.  Thus we have the new reckoning.  The crisis\r\nwhich threatened to divide the friends of the Union is past.\"\r\n\r\nAfter alluding to his Proclamation of Amnesty, issued simultaneously\r\nwith this Message, to all repentant Rebels who would take an oath\r\ntherein prescribed, and contending that such an oath should be (as he\r\nhad drawn it) to uphold not alone the Constitution and the Union, but\r\nthe Laws and Proclamations touching Slavery as well, President Lincoln\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\"In my judgment they have aided and will further aid, the Cause for\r\nwhich they were intended.  To now abandon them, would be not only to\r\nrelinquish a lever of power, but would also be a cruel and an astounding\r\nbreach of faith.\"  And, toward the close of the Message, he added:\r\n\r\n\"The movements by State action, for Emancipation, in several of the\r\nStates not included in the Emancipation Proclamation, are matters of\r\nprofound gratulation.  And while I do not repeat in detail what I have\r\nheretofore so earnestly urged upon the subject, my general views remain\r\nunchanged; and I trust that Congress will omit no fair opportunity of\r\nAIDING THESE IMPORTANT STEPS TO A GREAT CONSUMMATION.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln's patient but persistent solicitude, his earnest and\r\nunintermitted efforts--exercised publicly through his Messages and\r\nspeeches, and privately upon Members of Congress who called upon, or\r\nwhose presence was requested by him at the White House--in behalf of\r\nincorporating Emancipation in the Constitution, were now to give\r\npromise, at least, of bearing good fruit.\r\n\r\nMeasures looking to this end were submitted in both Houses of Congress\r\nsoon after its meeting, and were referred to the respective Judiciary\r\nCommittees of the same, and on the 10th of February, 1864, Mr. Trumbull\r\nreported to the Senate, from the Senate Judiciary Committee, of which he\r\nwas Chairman, a substitute Joint Resolution providing for the submission\r\nto the States of an Amendment to the United States Constitution in the\r\nfollowing words:\r\n\r\n\"ART. XIII., SEC. I.  Neither Slavery nor Involuntary Servitude, except\r\nas a punishment for crime, whereof the party shall have been duly\r\nconvicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to\r\ntheir jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n\"SEC. II.  Congress shall have power to enforce this Article by\r\nappropriate legislation.\"\r\n\r\nThis proposed Amendment came up for consideration in the Senate, on the\r\n28th of March, and a notable debate ensued.\r\n\r\nOn the same day, in the House of Representatives, Thaddeus Stevens--with\r\nthe object perhaps of ascertaining the strength, in that Body, of the\r\nfriends of out-and-out Emancipation--offered a Resolution proposing to\r\nthe States the following Amendments to the United States Constitution:\r\n\r\n\"ART. I.  Slavery and Involuntary Servitude, except for the punishment\r\nof crimes whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, is forever\r\nprohibited in the United States and all its Territories.\r\n\r\n\"ART. II.  So much of Article four, Section two, as refers to the\r\ndelivery up of Persons held to Service or Labor, escaping into another\r\nState, is annulled.\"\r\n\r\nThe test was made upon a motion to table the Resolution, which motion\r\nwas defeated by 38 yeas to 69 nays, and showed the necessity for\r\nconverting three members from the Opposition.  Subsequently, at the\r\ninstance of Mr. Stevens himself, the second Article of the Resolution\r\nwas struck out by 72 yeas to 26 nays.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings in both Houses of Congress upon these propositions to\r\nengraft upon the National Constitution a provision guaranteeing Freedom\r\nto all men upon our soil, were now interrupted by the death of one who\r\nwould almost have been willing to die twice over, if, by doing so, he\r\ncould have hastened their adoption.\r\n\r\nOwen Lovejoy, the life-long apostle of Abolitionism, the fervid\r\ngospeller of Emancipation, was dead; and it seemed almost the irony of\r\nFate that, at such a time, when Emancipation most needed all its friends\r\nto make it secure, its doughtiest champion should fall.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the eloquent tributes paid to his memory, in the Halls of\r\nCongress, helped the Cause no less.  They at least brought back to the\r\npublic mind the old and abhorrent tyrannies of the Southern Slave power;\r\nhow it had sought not not only to destroy freedom of Action, but freedom\r\nof Speech, and hesitated not to destroy human Life with these; reminded\r\nthe Loyal People of the Union of much that was hateful, from which they\r\nhad escaped; and strengthened the purpose of Patriots to fix in the\r\nchief corner-stone of the Constitution, imperishable muniments of human\r\nLiberty.\r\n\r\nLovejoy's brother had been murdered at Alton, Illinois, while\r\nvindicating freedom of Speech and of the Press; and the blood of that\r\nmartyr truly became \"the seed of the Church.\"  Arnold--recalling a\r\nspeech of Owen Lovejoy's at Chicago, and a passage in it, descriptive of\r\nthe martyrdom,--said to the House, on this sad occasion: \"I remember\r\nthat, after describing the scene of that death, in words--which stirred\r\nevery heart, he said he went a pilgrim to his brother's grave, and,\r\nkneeling upon the sod beneath which sleeps that brother, he swore, by\r\nthe everlasting God, eternal hostility to African Slavery.\"  And,\r\ncontinued Arnold, \"Well and nobly has he kept that oath.\"\r\n\r\nWashburne, too, reminded the House of the memorable episode in that very\r\nHall when, (April 5, 1860), the adherents of Slavery crowding around\r\nLovejoy with fierce imprecations and threats, seeking then and there to\r\nprevent Free Speech, \"he displayed that undaunted courage and matchless\r\nbearing which extorted the admiration of even his most deadly foes.\"\r\n\"His\"--continued the same speaker--\"was the eloquence of Mirabeau, which\r\nin the Tiers Etat and in the National Assembly made to totter the throne\r\nof France; it was the eloquence of Danton, who made all France to\r\ntremble from his tempestuous utterances in the National Convention.\r\nLike those apostles of the French Revolution, his eloquence could stir\r\nfrom the lowest depths all the passions of Man; but unlike them, he was\r\nas good and as pure as he was eloquent and brave, a noble minded\r\nChristian man, a lover of the whole human Race, and of universal Liberty\r\nregulated by Law.\"\r\n\r\nGrinnell, in his turn, told also with real pathos, of his having\r\nrecently seen Lovejoy in the chamber of sickness.  \"When,\" said\r\nGrinnell, \"I expressed fears for his recovery, I saw the tears course\r\ndown his manly cheek, as he said 'Ah! God's will be done, but I have\r\nbeen laboring, voting, and praying for twenty years that I might see the\r\ngreat day of Freedom which is so near and which I hope God will let me\r\nlive to rejoice in.  I want a vote on my Bill for the destruction of\r\nSlavery, root and branch.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     [Sumner, afterward speaking of Lovejoy and this Measure, said: \"On\r\n     the 14th of December, 1863, he introduced a Bill, whose title\r\n     discloses its character: 'A Bill to give effect to the Declaration\r\n     of Independence, and also to certain Provisions of the Constitution\r\n     of the United States.'  It proceeds to recite that All Men were\r\n     Created Equal, and were Endowed by the Creator with the Inalienable\r\n     Right to Life, Liberty and the Fruits of honest Toil; that the\r\n     Government of the United States was Instituted to Secure those\r\n     Rights; that the Constitution declares that No Person shall be\r\n     Deprived of Liberty without due Process of Law, and also provides\r\n     --article five, clause two--that this Constitution, and the Laws of\r\n     the United States made in pursuance thereof, shall be the Supreme\r\n     Law of the Land, and the Judges in each State shall be bound\r\n     thereby, anything in the Constitution and Laws of any State to the\r\n     contrary notwithstanding; that it is now demonstrated by the\r\n     Rebellion that Slavery is absolutely incompatible with the Union,\r\n     Peace, and General Welfare for which Congress is to Provide; and it\r\n     therefore Enacts that All Persons heretofore held in Slavery in any\r\n     of the States or Territories of the United States are declared\r\n     Freedmen, and are Forever Released from Slavery or Involuntary\r\n     Servitude except as Punishment for Crime on due conviction.  On the\r\n     same day he introduced another Bill to Protect Freedmen and to\r\n     Punish any one for Enslaving them.  These were among his last\r\n     Public acts,\"--Cong. Globe, 1st S., 38th C., Pt. 2, p.  1334]\r\n\r\nAnd staunch old Thaddeus Stevens said: \"The change to him, is great\r\ngain.  The only regret we can feel is that he did not live to see the\r\nsalvation of his Country; to see Peace and Union restored, and universal\r\nEmancipation given to his native land.  But such are the ways of\r\nProvidence.  Moses was not permitted to enter the Promised Land with\r\nthose he had led out of Bondage; he beheld it from afar off, and slept\r\nwith his fathers.\"  \"The deceased,\" he impressively added, \"needs no\r\nperishable monuments of brass or marble to perpetuate his name.  So long\r\nas the English language shall be spoken or deciphered, so long as\r\nLiberty shall have a worshipper, his name will be known!\"\r\n\r\nWhat influence the death of Owen Lovejoy may have had on the subsequent\r\nproceedings touching Emancipation interrupted as we have seen by his\r\ndemise--cannot be known; but among all the eloquent tributes to his\r\nmemory called forth by the mournful incident, perhaps none, could he\r\nhave heard it, would have better pleased him than those two opening\r\nsentences of Charles Summer's oration in the Senate--where he said of\r\nOwen Lovejoy: \"Could his wishes prevail, he would prefer much that\r\nSenators should continue in their seats and help to enact into Law some\r\none of the several Measures now pending to secure the obliteration of\r\nSlavery.  Such an Act would be more acceptable to him than any personal\r\ntribute,--\" unless it might be these other words, which followed from\r\nthe same lips: \"How his enfranchised Soul would be elevated even in\r\nthose Abodes to which he has been removed, to know that his voice was\r\nstill heard on Earth encouraging, exhorting, insisting that there should\r\nbe no hesitation anywhere in striking at Slavery; that this unpardonable\r\nwrong, from which alone the Rebellion draws its wicked life, must be\r\nblasted by Presidential proclamation, blasted by Act of Congress,\r\nblasted by Constitutional prohibition, blasted in every possible way, by\r\nevery available agency, and at every occurring opportunity, so that no\r\ntrace of the outrage may continue in the institutions of the Land, and\r\nespecially that its accursed foot-prints may no longer defile the\r\nNational Statute-book.  Sir, it will be in vain that you pass\r\nResolutions in tribute to him, if you neglect that Cause for which he\r\nlived, and do not hearken to his voice!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n                 \"THIRTEENTH AMENDMENT\" IN THE SENATE.\r\n\r\nDuring the great debate, which now opened in the Senate, upon the\r\nJudiciary Committee's substitute resolution for the Amendment of the\r\nConstitution, so as forever to prohibit Slavery within the United\r\nStates, and to empower Congress to pass such laws as would make that\r\nprohibition effective--participated in by Messrs. Trumbull, Wilson,\r\nSaulsbury, Davis, Harlan, Powell, Sherman, Clark, Hale, Hendricks,\r\nHenderson, Sumner, McDougall and others--the whole history of Slavery\r\nwas enquired into and laid bare.\r\n\r\nTrumbull insisted that Slavery was at the bottom of all the internal\r\ntroubles with which the Nation had from its birth been afflicted, down\r\nto this wicked Rebellion, with all the resulting \"distress, desolation,\r\nand death;\" and that by 1860, it had grown to such power and arrogance\r\nthat \"its advocates demanded the control of the Nation in\r\nits interests, failing in which, they attempted its overthrow.\"  He\r\nreviewed, at some length, what had been done by our Government with\r\nregard to Slavery, since the breaking out of hostilities against us in\r\nthat mad attempt against the National life; how, \"in the earlier stages\r\nof the War, there was an indisposition on the part of the Executive\r\nAuthority to interfere with Slavery at all;\" how, for a long time,\r\nSlaves, escaping to our lines, were driven back to their Rebel masters;\r\nhow the Act of Congress of July, 1861, which gave Freedom to all Slaves\r\nallowed by their Rebel masters to assist in the erection of Rebel works\r\nand fortifications, had \"not been executed,\" and, said Mr. Trumbull, \"so\r\nfar as I am advised, not a single Slave has been set at liberty under\r\nit;\" how, \"it was more than a year after its enactment before any\r\nconsiderable number of Persons of African descent were organized and\r\narmed\" under the subsequent law of December, 1861, which not only gave\r\nFreedom to all Slaves entering our Military lines, or who, belonging to\r\nRebel masters, were deserted by them, or were found in regions once\r\noccupied by Rebel forces and later by those of the Union, but also\r\nempowered the President to organize and arm them to aid in the\r\nsuppression of the Rebellion; how, it was not until this law had been\r\nenacted that Union officers ceased to expel Slaves coming within our\r\nlines--and then only when dismissal from the public service was made the\r\npenalty for such expulsion; how, by his Proclamations of Emancipation,\r\nof September, 1862, and January, 1863, the President undertook to\r\nsupplement Congressional action--which had, theretofore, been confined\r\nto freeing the Slaves of Rebels, and of such of these only as had come\r\nwithin the lines of our Military power-by also declaring, Free, the\r\nSlaves \"who were in regions of country from which the authority of the\r\nUnited States was expelled;\" and how, the \"force and effect\" of these\r\nProclamations were variously understood by the enemies and friends of\r\nthose measures--it being insisted on the one side that Emancipation as a\r\nWar-stroke was within the Constitutional War-power of the President as\r\nCommander-in-Chief, and that, by virtue of those Proclamations, \"all\r\nSlaves within the localities designated become ipso facto Free,\" and on\r\nthe other, that the Proclamations were \"issued without competent\r\nauthority,\" and had not effected and could not effect, \"the Emancipation\r\nof a single Slave,\" nor indeed could at any time, without additional\r\nlegislation, go farther than to liberate Slaves coming within the Union\r\nArmy lines.\r\n\r\nAfter demonstrating that \"any and all these laws and Proclamations,\r\ngiving to each the largest effect claimed by its friends, are\r\nineffectual to the destruction of Slavery,\" and protesting that some\r\nmore effectual method of getting rid of that Institution must be\r\nadopted, he declared, as his judgment, that \"the only effectual way of\r\nridding the Country of Slavery, so that it cannot be resuscitated, is by\r\nan Amendment of the Constitution forever prohibiting it within the\r\njurisdiction of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nHe then canvassed the chances of adoption of such an Amendment by an\r\naffirmative vote of two thirds in each House of Congress, and of its\r\nsubsequent ratification by three-fourths of the States of the Union, and\r\ndeclared that \"it is reasonable to suppose that if this proposed\r\nAmendment passes Congress, it will, within a year, receive the\r\nratification of the requisite number of States to make it a part of the\r\nConstitution.\"  His prediction proved correct--but only after a\r\nprotracted struggle.\r\n\r\nHenry Wilson also made a strong speech, but on different grounds.  He\r\nheld that the Emancipation Proclamations formed, together, a \"complete,\r\nabsolute, and final decree of Emancipation in Rebel States,\" and, being\r\n\"born of Military necessity\" and \"proclaimed by the Commander-in-Chief\r\nof the Army and Navy, is the settled and irrepealable Law of the\r\nRepublic, to be observed, obeyed, and enforced, by Army and Navy, and is\r\nthe irreversible voice of the Nation.\"\r\n\r\nHe also reviewed what had been done since the outbreak of the Rebellion,\r\nby Congress and the President, by Laws and Proclamations; and, while\r\nstanding by the Emancipation Proclamations, declared that \"the crowning\r\nAct, in this series of Acts, for the restriction and extinction of\r\nSlavery in America, is this proposed Amendment to the Constitution\r\nprohibiting the existence of Slavery in the Republic of the United\r\nStates.\"\r\n\r\nThe Emancipation Proclamation, according to his view, only needed\r\nenforcement, to give \"Peace and Order, Freedom and Unity, to a now\r\ndistracted Country;\" but the \"crowning act\" of incorporating this\r\nAmendment into the Constitution would do even more than all this, in\r\nthat it would \"obliterate the last lingering vestiges of the Slave\r\nSystem; its chattelizing, degrading, and bloody codes; its malignant,\r\nbarbarizing spirit; all it was, and is; everything connected with it or\r\npertaining to it, from the face of the Nation it has scarred with moral\r\ndesolation, from the bosom of the Country it has reddened with the blood\r\nand strewn with the graves of patriotism.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the debate proceeded, President Lincoln watched it with careful\r\ninterest.  Other matters, however, had, since the Battle of Chattanooga,\r\nlargely engrossed his attention.\r\n\r\nThe right man had at last been found--it was believed--to control as\r\nwell as to lead our Armies.  That man was Ulysses S. Grant.  The grade\r\nof Lieutenant General of the Army of the United States--in desuetude\r\nsince the days of Washington, except by brevet, in the case of Winfield\r\nScott,--having been especially revived by Congress for and filled by the\r\nappointment and confirmation of Grant, March 2, 1864, that great soldier\r\nimmediately came on to Washington, received his commission at the hands\r\nof President Lincoln, in the cabinet chamber of the White House, on the\r\n9th, paid a flying visit to the Army of the Potomac, on the 10th, and at\r\nonce returned to Nashville to plan future movements.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th, a General Order of the War Department (No.  98) was issued,\r\nrelieving Major-General Halleck, \"at his own request,\" from duty as\r\n\"General-in-Chief\" of the Army, and assigning Lieutenant-General U. S.\r\nGrant to \"the command of the Armies of the United States,\" \"the\r\nHeadquarters of the Army\" to be in Washington, and also with\r\nLieutenant-General Grant in the Field, Halleck being assigned to \"duty,\r\nin Washington, as Chief-of-staff of the Army, under the direction of the\r\nSecretary of War and the Lieutenant-General commanding.\"\r\n\r\nBy the same order, Sherman was assigned to the command of the \"Military\r\nDivision of the Mississippi,\" composed of the Departments of the Ohio,\r\nthe Cumberland, the Tennessee, and the Arkansas; and McPherson to that\r\nof the Department and Army of the Tennessee.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd of March, Grant was back again at Washington, and at once\r\nproceeded to Culpepper Court-house, Virginia, where his Headquarters in\r\nthe field were, for a time, to be.\r\n\r\nHere he completed his plans, and reorganized his Forces, for the coming\r\nconflicts, in the South-west and South-east, which were to result in a\r\nfull triumph to the Union Arms, and Peace to a preserved Union.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, from the utterances of Mr. Lincoln when Vicksburg fell,\r\nthat he had then become pretty well satisfied that Grant was \"the coming\r\nman,\" to whom it would be safe to confide the management and chief\r\nleadership of our Armies.  Chattanooga merely confirmed that belief--as\r\nindeed it did that of Union men generally.  But the concurrent judgment\r\nof Congress and the President had now, as we have seen, placed Grant in\r\nthat chief command; and the consequent relief to Mr. Lincoln, in thus\r\nhaving the heavy responsibility of Army-control, long unwillingly\r\nexercised by him, taken from his own shoulders and placed upon those of\r\nthe one great soldier in whom he had learned to have implicit faith,--a\r\nfaith earned by steady and unvaryingly successful achievements in the\r\nField--must have been most grateful.\r\n\r\nOther responsibilities would still press heavily enough upon the\r\nPresident's time and attention.  Questions touching the Military and\r\nCivil government of regions of the Enemy's country, conquered by the\r\nUnion arms; of the rehabilitation or reconstruction of the Rebel States;\r\nof a thousand and one other matters, of greater or lesser perplexity,\r\ngrowing out of these and other questions; besides the ever pressing and\r\ngigantic problems involved in the raising of enormous levies of troops,\r\nand prodigious sums of money, needed in securing, moving, and supplying\r\nthem, and defraying the extraordinary expenses growing out of the\r\nnecessary blockade of thousands of miles of Southern Coast, and other\r\nNaval movements; not to speak of those expenditures belonging to the\r\nmore ordinary business transactions of the Government.\r\n\r\nBut chief of all things claiming his especial solicitude, as we have\r\nseen, was this question of Emancipation by Constitutional enactment, the\r\ndebate upon which was now proceeding in the Senate.  That solicitude was\r\nnecessarily increased by the bitter opposition to it of Northern\r\nCopperheads, and by the attitude of the Border-State men, upon whose\r\nfinal action, the triumph or defeat of this great measure must\r\nultimately depend.\r\n\r\nMany of the latter, were, as has already been shown in these pages,\r\nloyal men; but the loyalty of some of these to their Country, was still\r\nso questionably and so thoroughly tainted with their worshipful devotion\r\nto Slavery--although they must have been blind indeed not to have\r\ndiscovered, long ere this, that it was a \"slowly-dying cause\"--that they\r\nwere ever on the alert to delay, hamper, and defeat, any action, whether\r\nExecutive or Legislative, and however necessary for the preservation of\r\nthe Union and the overthrow of its mortal enemies, which, never so\r\nlightly, impinged upon their \"sacred Institution.\"\r\n\r\nThis fact was well set forth, in this very debate, by a Senator from New\r\nEngland--[Wilson of Massachusetts]--when, after adjuring the\r\nanti-Slavery men of the age, not to forget the long list of Slavery's\r\ncrimes, he eloquently proceeded:\r\n\r\n\"Let them remember, too, that hundreds of thousands of our countrymen in\r\nLoyal States--since Slavery raised the banners of Insurrection, and sent\r\ndeath, wounds, sickness, and sorrow, into the homes of the People--have\r\nresisted, and still continue to resist, any measure for the defense of\r\nthe Nation, if that measure tended to impair the vital and animating\r\npowers of Slavery.  They resisted the Act making Free the Slaves used by\r\nRebels for Military purposes; the Confiscation of Rebel property and the\r\nFreedom of the Slaves of Rebel masters; the Abolition of Slavery in the\r\nCapital of the Nation, and the consecration of the Territories to Free\r\nLabor and Free laboring men; the Proclamation of Emancipation; the\r\nenlistment of Colored men to fight the battles of the Country; the\r\nFreedom of the Black soldier, who is fighting, bleeding, dying for the\r\nCountry; and the Freedom of his wife and children.  And now, when War\r\nhas for nearly three years menaced the life of the Nation, bathed the\r\nLand in blood, and filled two hundred thousand graves with our slain\r\nsons, these men of the Loyal States still cling to the falling fortunes\r\nof the relentless and unappeasable Enemy of their Country and its\r\ndemocratic institutions; they mourn, and will not be comforted, over the\r\nexpiring System, in the Border Slave-States; and, in tones of\r\nindignation or of anguish, they utter lamentations over the Proclamation\r\nof Emancipation, and the policy that is bringing Rebel States back again\r\nradiant with Freedom.\"\r\n\r\nAmong these \"loyal\" Democratic opponents of Emancipation, in any shape,\r\nor any where, were not wanting men--whether from Loyal Northern or\r\nBorder States--who still openly avowed that Slavery was right; that\r\nRebellion, to preserve its continuance, was justifiable; and that there\r\nwas no Constitutional method of uprooting it.\r\n\r\nSaulsbury of Delaware, was representative and spokesman of this class,\r\nand he took occasion during this very debate--[In the Senate, March 31,\r\n1864.]--to defend Slavery as a Divine Institution, which had the\r\nsanction both of the Mosaic and Christian Dispensations!\r\n\r\n     [Said he: \"Slavery had existed under some form or other from the\r\n     first period of recorded history.  It dates back even beyond the\r\n     period of Abraham, the Father of the Faithful, in whose seed all\r\n     the Nations of the Earth were to be blessed.  We find that,\r\n     immediately after the Flood, the Almighty, for purposes inscrutable\r\n     to us, condemned a whole race to Servitude: 'Vayomer Orur Knoan\r\n     Efet Afoatim Yeahio Le-echot:' 'And he said, Cursed be Canaan;\r\n     Slave of Slaves he shall be to his brethren.'  It continued among\r\n     all people until the advent of the Christian era.  It was\r\n     recognized in that New Dispensation, which was to supersede the\r\n     Old.  It has the sanction of God's own Apostle; for when Paul sent\r\n     back Onesimus to Philemon, whom did he send?  A Freeman?  No, Sir.\r\n     He sent his (doulos,) a Slave, born as such, not even his\r\n     andrapodon, who was such by captivity in War.  Among all people,\r\n     and in all ages, has this Institution, if such it is to be called,\r\n     existed, and had the countenance of wise and good men, and even of\r\n     the Christian Church itself, until these modern times, up at least\r\n     to the Nineteenth Century.  It exists in this Country, and has\r\n     existed from the beginning.\"\r\n\r\n     Mr. Harlan's reply to the position of Mr. Saulsbury that Slavery is\r\n     right, is a Divine Institution, etc., was very able and\r\n     interesting.  He piled up authority after authority, English as\r\n     well as American, to show that there is no support of Slavery--and\r\n     especially of the title to services of the adult offspring of a\r\n     Slave--at Common Law; and, after also proving, by the mouth of a\r\n     favorite son of Virginia, that it has no legal existence by virtue\r\n     of any Municipal or Statutory Law, he declared that the only\r\n     remaining Law that can be cited for its support is the Levitical\r\n     Code\"--as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"'Both thy Bondmen, and thy Bondmaids, which thou shalt have, shall\r\n     be of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy\r\n     Bondmen and Bondmaids.\r\n\r\n     \"'Moreover, of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among\r\n     you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you,\r\n     which they begat in your land; and they shall be your possession.\r\n\r\n     \"'And ye shall take them as an Inheritance for your children after\r\n     you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your Bondmen\r\n     forever.\"'\r\n\r\n     \"I remark,\" said he, \"in this connection, that the Levitical Code,\r\n     or the Hebrew Law, contains a provision for the Naturalization of\r\n     Foreigners, whether captives of War, or voluntary emigrants.  By\r\n     compliance with the requirements of this law they became citizens,\r\n     entitled to all the rights and privileges and immunities of native\r\n     Hebrews.  The Hebrew Slave Code, applicable to Enslaved Hebrews, is\r\n     in these words:\r\n\r\n     \"'And if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold\r\n     unto thee, and serve thee six years, then in the seventh year thou\r\n     shalt let him go Free from thee.'\r\n\r\n     \"Here I request the attention of those who claim compensation for\r\n     Emancipated Slaves to the text:\r\n\r\n     \"'And when thou sendest him out Free from thee, thou shalt not let\r\n     him go away empty:\r\n\r\n     \"'Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy floor'--\r\n\r\n     \"Which means granaries--\r\n\r\n     \"'and out of thy wine-press: of that wherewith the Lord thy God\r\n     hath blessed thee, thou shalt give unto him.'\r\n\r\n     \"'It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou sendest him away Free\r\n     from thee, for he hath been worth a double-hired servant to thee,\r\n     in serving thee six years.'\r\n\r\n     \"These Hebrew Statutes provide that the heathen might be purchased\r\n     and held as Slaves, and their posterity after them; that under\r\n     their Naturalization Laws all strangers and sojourners, Bond and\r\n     Free, have the privilege of acquiring the rights of citizenship;\r\n     that all Hebrews, natives or naturalized, might assert and maintain\r\n     their right to Freedom.\r\n\r\n     \"At the end of six years a Hebrew Slave thus demanding his Liberty,\r\n     was not to be sent away empty; the owner, so far from claiming\r\n     compensation from his neighbors or from the Public Treasury for\r\n     setting him Free, was bound to divide with the Freedman, of his own\r\n     possessions: to give him of his flocks, of his herds, of his\r\n     granary, and of his winepress, of everything with which the Lord\r\n     Almighty had blessed the master during the years of his Servitude;\r\n     and then the owner was admonished that he was not to regard it as a\r\n     hardship to be required to Liberate the Slave, and to divide with\r\n     him of his substance.\r\n\r\n     \"The Almighty places the Liberated Slave's claim to a division of\r\n     his former master's property on the eternal principles of Justice,\r\n     the duty to render an equivalent for an equivalent.  The Slave\r\n     having served six years must be paid for his Service, must be paid\r\n     liberally because he had been worth even more than a hired servant\r\n     during the period of his enslavement.\r\n\r\n     \"If, then,\" continued Mr. Harlan, \"the justice of this claim cannot\r\n     be found either in Reason, Natural Justice, or the principles of\r\n     the Common Law, or in any positive Municipal or Statute regulation\r\n     of any State, or in the Hebrew Code written by the Finger of God\r\n     protruded from the flame of fire on the summit of Sinai, I ask\r\n     whence the origin of the title to the services of the adult\r\n     offspring of the Slave mother?  or is it not manifest that there is\r\n     no just title?  Is it not a mere usurpation without any known mode\r\n     of justification, under any existing Code of Laws, human or\r\n     Divine?\"]\r\n\r\nHe also undertook to justify Secession on the singular ground that \"we\r\nare sprung from a Race of Secessionists,\" the proof of which he held to\r\nbe in the fact that, while the preamble to, as well as the body of the\r\nConvention of Ratification of, the old Articles of Confederation between\r\nthe States of New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island and\r\nProvidence Plantations, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,\r\nDelaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and\r\nGeorgia, declared that Confederation to be a \"Perpetual Union,\" yet,\r\nwithin nine years thereafter, all the other States Seceded from New\r\nYork, Virginia, North Carolina, and Rhode Island by ratifying the new\r\nConstitution for \"a more perfect Union.\"\r\n\r\nHe also endeavored to maintain the extraordinary proposition that \"if\r\nthe Senate of the United States were to adopt this Joint-resolution, and\r\nwere to submit it to all the States of this Union, and if three-fourths\r\nof the States should ratify the Amendment, it would not be binding on\r\nany State whose interest was affected by it, if that State protested\r\nagainst it!\"  And beyond all this, he re-echoed the old, old cry of the\r\nBorder-state men, that \"the time is unpropitious for such a measure as\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\nReverdy Johnson, of Maryland, however, by his great speech, of April\r\n5th, in the Senate, did much to clear the tangle in the minds of some\r\nfaltering Union statesmen on this important subject.\r\n\r\nHe reviewed the question of human Slavery from the time when the\r\nConstitutional Convention was held; showed that at that period, as well\r\nas at the time of the Declaration of our Independence \"there was but one\r\nsentiment upon the subject among enlightened Southern statesmen\"--and\r\nthat was, that Slavery \"is a great affliction to any Country where it\r\nprevails;\" and declared that \"a prosperous and permanent Peace can never\r\nbe secured if the Institution is permitted to survive.\"\r\n\r\nHe then traversed the various methods by which statesmen were seeking to\r\nprevent that survival of Slavery, addressing himself by turns to the\r\narguments of those who, with John Sherman, \"seemed,\" said he, \"to\r\nconsider it as within the power of Congress by virtue of its Legislative\r\nauthority;\" to those of the \"many well-judging men, with the President\r\nat their head, who,\" to again use his own words, \"seem to suppose that\r\nit is within the reach of the Executive;\" and lastly, to those \"who\r\nexpress the opinion that it is not within the scope of either Executive\r\nor Legislative authority, or of Constitutional Amendment;\" and after\r\ndemolishing the arguments of those who held the two former of these\r\npositions, he proceeded to rebut the assumption that Slavery could not\r\nbe abolished at all because it was not originally abolished by the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nContinuing, he said: \"Remember, now, the question is, can that\r\nInstitution, which deals with Humanity as Property, which claims to\r\nshackle the mind, the soul, and the body, which brings to the level of\r\nthe brute a portion of the race of Man, cease to be within the reach of\r\nthe political power of the People of the United States, not because it\r\nwas not at one time within their power, but because at that time they\r\ndid not exert the power?\r\n\r\n\"What says the Preamble to the Constitution?  How pregnant with a\r\nconclusive answer is the Preamble, to the proposition that Slavery\r\ncannot be abolished!  What does that Preamble state to have been the\r\nchief objects that the great and wise and good men had at heart, in\r\nrecommending the Constitution, with that Preamble, to the adoption of\r\nthe American People?  That Justice might be established; that\r\nTranquillity might be preserved; that the common Defense and general\r\nWelfare might be maintained; and, last and chief of all, that Liberty\r\nmight be secured.\r\n\r\n\"Is there no Justice in putting an end to human Slavery?  Is there no\r\ndanger to the Tranquillity of the Country in its existence?  May it not\r\ninterfere with the common Defense and general Welfare?  And, above all,\r\nis it consistent with any notion, which the mind of man can conceive, of\r\nhuman Liberty?\"\r\n\r\nHe held that the very Amendatory clause of the Constitution under which\r\nit was proposed to make this Amendment, was probably inserted there from\r\na conviction of that coming time \"when Justice would call so loudly for\r\nthe extinction of the Institution that her call could not be disobeyed,\"\r\nand, when \"the Peace and Tranquillity of the Land would demand, in\r\nthunder tones,\" its destruction, \"as inconsistent with such Peace and\r\nTranquillity.\"\r\n\r\nTo the atrocious pretence that \"there was a right to make a Slave of any\r\nhuman being\"--which he said would have shocked every one of the framers\r\nof the Constitution had they heard it; and, what he termed, the nauseous\r\ndeclaration that \"Slavery of the Black race is of Divine origin,\" and\r\nwas intended to be perpetual; he said:\r\n\r\n\"The Saviour of Mankind did not put an end to it by physical power, or\r\nby the declaration of any existing illegality, in word.  His mission\r\nupon Earth was not to propagate His doctrines by force.  He came to\r\nsave, not to conquer.  His purpose was not to march armed legions\r\nthroughout the habitable Globe, securing the allegiance of those for\r\nwhose safety He was striving.  He warred by other influences.  He aimed\r\nat the heart, principally.  He inculcated his doctrines, more ennobling\r\nthan any that the World, enlightened as it was before His advent upon\r\nEarth, had been able to discover.  He taught to Man the obligation of\r\nbrotherhood.  He announced that the true duty of Man was to do to others\r\nas he would have others do to him--to all men, the World over; and\r\nunless some convert to the modern doctrine that Slavery itself finds not\r\nonly a guarantee for its existence, but for its legal existence, in the\r\nScripture, excepts from the operation of the influences which His\r\nmorality brought to bear on the mind of the Christian world, the Black\r\nman, and shows that it was not intended to apply to Black men, then it\r\nis not true, it cannot be true, that He designed His doctrine not to be\r\nequally applicable to the Black and to the White, to the Race of Man as\r\nhe then existed, or as he might exist in all after-time.\"\r\n\r\nTo the assumption that the African Slaves were too utterly deficient and\r\ndegraded, mentally and morally, to appreciate the blessings of Freedom,\r\nhe opposed the eloquent fact that \"wherever the flag of the United\r\nStates, the symbol of human Liberty, now goes; under it, from their\r\nhereditary bondage, are to be found men and women and children\r\nassembling and craving its protection 'fleeing from' the iron of\r\noppression that had pierced their souls, to the protection of that flag\r\nwhere they are 'gladdened by the light of Liberty.'\"\r\n\r\n\"It is idle to deny,\" said he--\"we feel it in our own persons--how, with\r\nreference to that sentiment, all men are brethren.  Look to the\r\nillustrations which the times now afford, how, in the illustration of\r\nthat sentiment, do we differ from the Black man?  He is willing to incur\r\nevery personal danger which promises to result in throwing down his\r\nshackles, and making him tread the Earth, which God has created for all,\r\nas a man, and not as a Slave.\"\r\n\r\nSaid he: \"It is an instinct of the Soul.  Tyranny may oppress it for\r\nages and centuries; the pall of despotism may hang over it; but the\r\nsentiment is ever there; it kindles into a flame in the very furnace of\r\naffliction, and it avails itself of the first opportunity that offers,\r\npromising the least chance of escape, and wades through blood and\r\nslaughter to achieve it, and, whether it succeeds or fails,\r\ndemonstrates, vindicates in the very effort, the inextinguishable right\r\nto Liberty.\"\r\n\r\nHe thought that mischiefs might result from this measure, owing to the\r\nuneducated condition of the Slave, but they would be but temporary.  At\r\nall events to \"suffer those Africans,\" said he, \"whom we are calling\r\naround our standard, and asking to aid us in restoring the Constitution\r\nand the power of the Government to its rightful authority, to be reduced\r\nto bondage again,\" would be \"a disgrace to the Nation.\"  The\r\n\"Institution\" must be terminated.\r\n\r\n\"Terminate it,\" continued he, \"and the wit of man will, as I think, be\r\nunable to devise any other topic upon which we can be involved in a\r\nfratricidal strife.  God and nature, judging by the history of the past,\r\nintend us to be one.  Our unity is written in the mountains and the\r\nrivers, in which we all have an interest.  The very differences of\r\nclimate render each important to the other, and alike important.\r\n\r\n\"That mighty horde which, from time to time, have gone from the\r\nAtlantic, imbued with all the principles of human Freedom which animated\r\ntheir fathers in running the perils of the mighty Deep and seeking\r\nLiberty here, are now there; and as they have said, they will continue\r\nto say, until time shall be no more: 'We mean that the Government in\r\nfuture shall be, as it has been in the past--Once an exemplar of human\r\nFreedom, for the light and example of the World; illustrating in the\r\nblessings and the happiness it confers, the truth of the principles\r\nincorporated into the Declaration of Independence, that Life and Liberty\r\nare Man's inalienable right.\"\r\n\r\nFortunately the Democratic opposition, in the Senate, to\r\nthis measure, was too small in numbers to beat the proposed Amendment,\r\nbut by offering amendments to it, its enemies succeeded in delaying its\r\nadoption.\r\n\r\nHowever, on the 5th of April, an amendment, offered by Garrett Davis,\r\nwas acted upon.  It was to strike out all after the preamble of the\r\nXIIIth Article of Amendment to the Constitution, proposed by the\r\nJudiciary Committee, and insert the words:\r\n\r\n\"No Negro, or Person whose mother or grandmother is or was a Negro,\r\nshall be a citizen of the United States and be eligible to any Civil or\r\nMilitary office, or to any place of trust or profit under the United\r\nStates.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Davis's amendment was rejected by a vote of 5 yeas to 32 nays; when\r\nhe immediately moved to amend, by adding precisely the same words at the\r\nend of Section 1 of the proposed Article.  It was again rejected.  He\r\nthen moved to amend by adding to the said Section these words:\r\n\r\n\"But no Slave shall be entitled to his or her Freedom under this\r\nAmendment if resident at the time it takes effect in any State, the laws\r\nof which forbid Free Negroes to reside therein, until removed from such\r\nState by the Government of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThis also was rejected.  Whereupon Mr. Powell moved to add, at the end\r\nof the first Section, the words:\r\n\r\n\"No Slave shall be Emancipated by this Article unless the owner thereof\r\nshall be first paid the value of the Slave or Slaves so Emancipated.\"\r\n\r\nThis likewise was rejected, on a yea and nay vote, by 2 yeas (Davis and\r\nPowell) to 34 nays; when Mr. Davis moved another amendment, viz.: to add\r\nat the end of Section 2 of the proposed Article, the following:\r\n\r\n\"And when this Amendment of the Constitution shall have taken effect by\r\nFreeing the Slaves, Congress shall provide for the distribution and\r\nsettlement of all the population of African descent in the United States\r\namong the several States and Territories thereof, in proportion to the\r\nWhite population of each State and Territory to the aggregate population\r\nof those of African descent.\"\r\n\r\nThis met a like fate; whereupon the Senate adjourned, but, on the\r\nfollowing day, the matter came up again for consideration:\r\n\r\nHale, of New Hampshire, jubilantly declared that \"this is a day that I\r\nand many others have long wished for, long hoped for, long striven for.\r\n* * *  A day when the Nation is to commence its real life; or, if it is\r\nnot the day, it is the dawning of the day; the day is near at hand * * *\r\nwhen the American People are to wake up to the meaning of the sublime\r\ntruths which their fathers uttered years ago, and which have slumbered,\r\ndead-letters, upon the pages of our Constitution, of our Declaration of\r\nIndependence, and of our history.\"\r\n\r\nMcDougall, of California, on the other hand,--utterly regardless of the\r\ngrandly patriotic resolutions of the Legislature of his State, which had\r\njust been presented to the Senate by his colleague--lugubriously\r\ndeclared:\r\n\r\n\"In my judgment, it may well be said of us:\r\n\r\n               'Let the Heavens be hung in black\r\n               And let the Earth put mourning on,'\r\n\r\nfor in the history of no Free People, since the time the Persians came\r\ndown upon Athens, have I known as melancholy a period as this day and\r\nyear of Our Lord in our history; and if we can, by the blessing of God\r\nand by His favor, rise above it, it will be by His special providence,\r\nand by no act of ours.\"\r\n\r\nThe obstructive tactics were now resumed, Mr. Powell leading off by a\r\nmotion to amend, by adding to the Judiciary Committee's proposed\r\nThirteenth Article of the Constitution, the following:\r\n\r\n\"ART. 14.--The President and Vice-President shall hold their Offices for\r\nthe term of four--[Which he subsequently modified to: 'six years']\r\n--years.  The person who has filled the Office of President shall not be\r\nreeligible.\"\r\n\r\nThis amendment was rejected by 12 yeas to 32 nays; whereupon Mr. Powell\r\nmoved to add to the Committee's Proposition another new Article, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"ART. 14.--The principal Officer in each of the Executive Departments,\r\nand all persons connected with the Diplomatic Service, may be removed\r\nfrom office at the pleasure of the President.  All other officers of the\r\nExecutive Departments may be removed at any time by the President or\r\nother appointing power when their services are unnecessary, or for\r\ndishonesty, incapacity, inefficiency, misconduct, or neglect of duty,\r\nand when so removed, the removal shall be reported to the Senate,\r\ntogether with the reasons therefor.\"\r\n\r\nThis amendment also being rejected, Mr. Powell offered another, which\r\nwas to add a separate Article as follows:\r\n\r\n\"ART. 14.--Every law, or Resolution having the force of law, shall\r\nrelate to but one subject, and that shall be expressed in its title.\"\r\n\r\nThis also being rejected--the negative vote being, as in other cases,\r\nwithout reference to the merits of the proposition--and Mr. Powell\r\nhaving now apparently exhausted his obstructive amendatory talents, Mr.\r\nDavis came to the aid of his Kentucky colleague by moving an amendment,\r\nto come in as an additional Article, being a new plan of Presidential\r\nelection designed to do away with the quadrennial Presidential campaign\r\nbefore the People by giving to each State the right to nominate one\r\ncandidate, and leaving it to a Convention of both Houses of Congress\r\n--and, in case of disagreement, to the Supreme Court of the United States\r\n--to elect a President and a Vice-President.\r\n\r\nThe rejection of this proposition apparently exhausted the stock of\r\npossible amendments possessed by the Democratic opposition, and the\r\nJoint Resolution, precisely as it came from the Judiciary Committee,\r\nhaving been agreed to by that body, \"as in Committee of the Whole,\" was\r\nnow, April 6th, reported to the Senate for its concurrence.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, Mr. Hendricks uttered a lengthy jeremiad on the\r\nWar, and its lamentable results; intimated that along the Mississippi,\r\nthe Negroes, freed by the advance of our invading Armies and Navies,\r\ninstead of being happy and industrious, were without protection or\r\nprovision and almost without clothing, while at least 200,000 of them\r\nhad prematurely perished, and that such was the fate reserved for the\r\n4,000,000 Negroes if liberated; and declared he would not vote for the\r\nResolution, \"because,\" said he, \"the times are not auspicious.\"\r\n\r\nVery different indeed was the attitude of Mr. Henderson, of Missouri,\r\nBorder-State man though he was.  In the course of a speech, of much\r\npower, which he opened with an allusion to the 115,000 Slaves owned in\r\nhis State in 1860--as showing how deeply interested Missouri \"must be in\r\nthe pending proposition\"--the Senator announced that: \"Our great\r\ninterest, as lovers of the Union, is in the preservation and\r\nperpetuation of the Union.\"  He declared himself a Slaveholder, yet none\r\nthe less desired the adoption of this Thirteenth Article of Amendment,\r\nfor, said he: \"We cannot save the Institution if we would.  We ought not\r\nif we could.  * * *  If it were a blessing, I, for one, would be\r\ndefending it to the last.  It is a curse, and not a blessing.  Therefore\r\nlet it go.  * * * Let the iniquity be cast away!\"\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that a remarkable letter written by Mr. Lincoln\r\nto a Kentuckian, on the subject of Emancipation, appeared in print.  It\r\nis interesting as being not alone the President's own statement of his\r\nviews, from the beginning, as to Slavery, and how he came to be \"driven\"\r\nto issue the Proclamation of Emancipation, and as showing how the Union\r\nCause had gained by its issue, but also in disclosing, indirectly, how\r\nincessantly the subject was revolved in his own mind, and urged by him\r\nupon the minds of others.  The publication of the letter, moreover, was\r\nnot without its effect on the ultimate action of the Congress and the\r\nStates in adopting the Thirteenth Amendment.  It ran thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \"EXECUTIVE MANSION.\r\n                    \"WASHINGTON, April 4, 1864.\r\n\r\n\"A. G. HODGES, Esq., Frankfort, Ky.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR: You ask me to put in writing the substance of--what I\r\nverbally said the other day, in your presence, to Governor Bramlette and\r\nSenator Dixon.  It was about as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I am naturally anti-Slavery.  If Slavery is not wrong, nothing is\r\nwrong.  I cannot remember when I did not so think and feel, and yet I\r\nhave never understood that the 'Presidency conferred upon me an\r\nunrestricted right to act officially upon this judgment and feeling.\r\n\r\n\"It was in the oath I took, that I would to the best of my ability\r\npreserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.  I\r\ncould not take the Office without taking the oath.  Nor was it my view\r\nthat I might take an oath to get power, and break the oath in using the\r\npower.\r\n\r\n\"I understood, too, that in ordinary and Civil Administration this oath\r\neven forbade me to practically indulge my primary abstract judgment on\r\nthe moral question of Slavery.  I had publicly declared this many times,\r\nand in many ways.\r\n\r\n\"And I aver that, to this day, I have done no Official act in mere\r\ndeference to my abstract judgment and feeling on Slavery.\r\n\r\n\"I did understand, however, that my oath to preserve the Constitution to\r\nthe best of my ability, imposed upon me the duty of preserving by every\r\nindispensable means, that Government--that Nation, of which that\r\nConstitution was the Organic Law.\r\n\r\n\"Was it possible to lose the Nation and yet preserve the Constitution?\r\n\r\n\"By General Law, life and limb must be protected; yet often a limb must\r\nbe amputated to save a life; but a life is never wisely given to save a\r\nlimb.  I felt that measures, otherwise Unconstitutional, might become\r\nlawful, by becoming Indispensable to the Constitution through the\r\npreservation of the Nation.\r\n\r\n\"Right or wrong, I assumed this ground, and now avow it.  I could not\r\nfeel that, to the best of my ability, I have even tried to preserve the\r\nConstitution, if, to save Slavery, or any minor matter, I should permit\r\nthe wreck of Government, Country, and Constitution, altogether.\r\n\r\n\"When, early in the War, General Fremont attempted Military\r\nEmancipation, I forbade it, because I did not then think it an\r\nIndispensable Necessity.\r\n\r\n\"When, a little later, General Cameron, then Secretary of War, suggested\r\nthe Arming of the Blacks, I objected, because I did not yet think it an\r\nIndispensable Necessity.\r\n\r\n\"When, still later, General Hunter attempted Military Emancipation, I\r\nagain forbade it, because I did not yet think the Indispensable\r\nNecessity had come.\r\n\r\n\"When in March, and May, and July, 1862, I made earnest and successive\r\nappeals to the Border-States to favor compensated Emancipation, I\r\nbelieved the Indispensable Necessity for Military Emancipation and\r\narming the Blacks would come, unless averted by that measure.\r\n\r\n\"They declined the proposition, and I was, in my best judgment, driven\r\nto the alternative of either surrendering the Union, and with it, the\r\nConstitution, or of laying strong hand upon the Colored element.  I\r\nchose the latter.  In choosing it, I hoped for greater gain than loss,\r\nbut of this I was not entirely confident.\r\n\r\n\"More than a year of trial now shows no loss by it in our Foreign\r\nRelations, none in our home popular sentiment, none in our white\r\nMilitary force, no loss by it anyhow, or anywhere.  On the contrary, it\r\nshows a gain of quite a hundred and thirty thousand soldiers, seamen,\r\nand laborers.\r\n\r\n\"These are palpable facts, about which, as facts, there can be no\r\ncavilling.  We have the men; and we could not have had them without the\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\n\"And now let any Union man who complains of this measure, test himself\r\nby writing down in one line, that he is for subduing the Rebellion by\r\nforce of arms; and in the next, that he is for taking one hundred and\r\nthirty thousand men from the Union side, and placing them where they\r\nwould be best for the measure he condemns.  If he cannot face his case\r\nso stated, it is only because he cannot face the truth.\r\n\r\n\"I add a word which was not in the verbal conversation.  In telling this\r\ntale, I attempt no compliment to my own sagacity.  I claim not to have\r\ncontrolled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me.\r\nNow at the end of three years' struggle, the Nation's condition is not\r\nwhat either Party, or any man, devised or expected.  God alone can claim\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"Whither it is tending seems plain.  If God now wills the removal of a\r\ngreat wrong, and wills also that we of the North, as well as you of the\r\nSouth, shall pay fairly for our complicity in that wrong, impartial\r\nhistory will find therein new causes to attest and revere the Justice\r\nand goodness of God.\r\n                    \"Yours truly,\r\n                              \"A. LINCOLN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 8th of April (1864) turned out to be the decisive field-day in the\r\nSenate.  Sumner endeavored to close the debate on that day in a speech\r\nremarkable no less for its power and eloquence of statement, its\r\nstrength of Constitutional exposition, and its abounding evidences of\r\nextensive historical research and varied learning, than for its\r\npatriotic fervor and devotion to human Freedom.\r\n\r\nToward the end of that great speech, however, he somewhat weakened its\r\nforce by suggesting a change in the phraseology of the proposed\r\nThirteenth Amendment, so that, instead of almost precisely following the\r\nlanguage of the Jeffersonian Ordinance of 1787, as recommended by the\r\nJudiciary Committee of the Senate, it should read thus:\r\n\r\n\"All Persons are Equal before the Law, so that no person can hold\r\nanother as a Slave; and the Congress may make all laws necessary and\r\nproper to carry this Article into effect everywhere within the United\r\nStates and the jurisdiction thereof.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner's idea in antagonizing the Judiciary Committee's proposition\r\nwith this, was to introduce into our Organic Act, distinctive words\r\nasserting the \"Equality before the Law\" of all persons, as expressed in\r\nthe Constitutional Charters of Belgium, Italy and Greece, as well as in\r\nthe various Constitutions of France--beginning with that of September,\r\n1791, which declared (Art. 1) that \"Men are born and continue Free and\r\nEqual in Rights;\" continuing in that of June, 1793, which declares that\r\n\"All Men are Equal by Nature and before the Law:\" in that of June, 1814,\r\nwhich declares that \"Frenchmen are Equal before the Law, whatever may be\r\notherwise their title and ranks;\" and in the Constitutional Charter of\r\nAugust, 1830 in similar terms to the last.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said he, \"while desirous of seeing the great rule of Freedom\r\nwhich we are about to ordain, embodied in a text which shall be like the\r\nprecious casket to the more precious treasure, yet * * * I am consoled\r\nby the thought that the most homely text containing such a rule will be\r\nmore beautiful far than any words of poetry or eloquence, and that it\r\nwill endure to be read with gratitude when the rising dome of this\r\nCapitol, with the Statue of Liberty which surmounts it, has crumbled to\r\ndust.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner's great speech, however, by no means ended the debate.  It\r\nbrought Mr. Powell to his feet with a long and elaborate contention\r\nagainst the general proposition, in the course of which he took occasion\r\nto sneer at Sumner's \"most remarkable effort,\" as one of his \"long\r\nillogical rhapsodies on Slavery, like:\r\n\r\n                              '--a Tale\r\n               Told by an Idiot, full of sound and fury,\r\n               Signifying nothing.'\"\r\n\r\nHe professed that he wanted \"the Union to be restored with the\r\nConstitution as it is;\" that he verily believed the passage of this\r\nAmendment would be \"the most effective Disunion measure that could be\r\npassed by Congress\"--and, said he, \"As a lover of the Union I oppose\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n     [This phrase slightly altered, in words, but not in meaning, to\r\n     \"The Union as it was, and the Constitution as it is,\" afterward\r\n     became the Shibboleth under which the Democratic Party in the\r\n     Presidential Campaign of 1864, marched to defeat.]\r\n\r\nHe endeavored to impute the blame for the War, to the northern\r\nAbolitionists, for, said he: \"Had there been no Abolitionists, North,\r\nthere never would have been a Fire-eater, South,\"--apparently ignoring\r\nthe palpable fact that had there been no Slavery in the South, there\r\ncould have been no \"Abolitionists, North.\"\r\n\r\nHe heatedly denounced the \"fanatical gentlemen\" who desired the passage\r\nof this measure; declared they intended by its passage \"to destroy the\r\nInstitution of Slavery or to destroy the Union,\" and exclaimed: \"Pass\r\nthis Amendment and you make an impassable chasm, as if you were to put a\r\nlake of burning fire, between the adhering States and those who are out.\r\nYou will then have to make it a War of conquest and extermination before\r\nyou can ever bring them back under the flag of the Government.  There is\r\nno doubt about that proposition.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner, at this point, withdrew his proposed amendment, at the\r\nsuggestion of Mr. Howard, who expressed a preference \"to dismiss all\r\nreference to French Constitutions and French Codes, and go back to the\r\ngood old Anglo-Saxon language employed by our Fathers, in the Ordinance\r\nof 1787, (in) an expression adjudicated upon repeatedly, which is\r\nperfectly well understood both by the public and by Judicial Tribunals\r\n--a phrase, which is peculiarly near and dear to the people of the\r\nNorthwestern Territory, from whose soil Slavery was excluded by it.\"\r\n\r\n     [The following is the language of \"the Ordinance of 1787\" thus\r\n     referred to:\r\n\r\n     \"ART. 6.--There shall be neither Slavery nor Involuntary Servitude\r\n     in the said Territory, otherwise than in the punishment of crimes,\r\n     whereof the party shall have been duly convicted: * * *.\"]\r\n\r\nMr. Davis thereupon made another opposition speech and, at its\r\nconclusion, Mr. Saulsbury offered, as a substitute, an Article,\r\ncomprising no less than twenty sections--that, he said, \"embodied in\r\nthem some things\" which \"did not meet his personal approbation,\" but he\r\nhad consented to offer them to the Senate as \"a Compromise\"--as \"a Peace\r\noffering.\"\r\n\r\nThe Saulsbury substitute being voted down, the debate closed with a\r\nspeech by Mr. McDougall--an eloquent protest from his standpoint, in\r\nwhich, after endorsing the wild statement of Mr. Hendricks that 250,000\r\nof the people of African descent had been prematurely destroyed on the\r\nMississippi, he continued.\r\n\r\n\"This policy will ingulf them.  It is as simple a truth as has ever been\r\ntaught by any history.  The Slaves of ancient time were not the Slaves\r\nof a different Race.  The Romans compelled the Gaul and the Celt,\r\nbrought them to their own Country, and some of them became great poets,\r\nand some eloquent orators, and some accomplished wits, and they became\r\ncitizens of the Republic of Greece, and of the Republic of Rome, and of\r\nthe Empire.\r\n\r\n\"This is not the condition of these persons with whom we are now\r\nassociated, and about whose affairs we undertake to establish\r\nadministration.  They can never commingle with us.  It may not be within\r\nthe reading of some learned Senators, and yet it belongs to demonstrated\r\nScience, that the African race and the European are different; and I\r\nhere now say it as a fact established by science, that the eighth\r\ngeneration of the Mixed race formed by the union of the African and\r\nEuropean, cannot continue their species.  Quadroons have few children;\r\nwith Octoroons reproduction is impossible.\r\n\r\n\"It establishes as a law of nature that the African has no proper\r\nrelation to the European, Caucasian, blood.  I would have them kindly\r\ntreated.  * * *  Against all such policy and all such conduct I shall\r\nprotest as a man, in the name of humanity, and of law, and of truth, and\r\nof religion.\"\r\n\r\nThe amendment made, as in Committee of the Whole, having been concurred\r\nin, etc., the Joint Resolution, as originally reported by the Judiciary\r\nCommittee, was at last passed, (April 8th)--by a vote of 38 yeas to 6\r\nnays--Messrs.  Hendricks and McDougall having the unenviable distinction\r\nof being the only two Senators, (mis-)representing Free States, who\r\nvoted against this definitive Charter of American Liberty.\r\n\r\n     [The full Senate vote, on passing the Thirteenth Amendment, was:\r\n\r\n     YEAS-Messrs.

What would be its fate there?\r\nThis was a question which gave to Mr. Lincoln, and the other friends of\r\nLiberty and Union, great concern.\r\n\r\nIt is true that various votes had recently been taken in that body, upon\r\npropositions which had an indirect bearing upon the subject of\r\nEmancipation, as, for instance, that of the 1st of February, 1864, when,\r\nby a vote of 80 yeas to 46 nays, it had adopted a Resolution declaring\r\n\"That a more vigorous policy to enlist, at an early day, and in larger\r\nnumbers, in our Army, persons of African descent, would meet the\r\napprobation of the House;\" and that vote, although indirect, being so\r\nvery nearly a two-thirds vote, was most encouraging.  But, on the other\r\nhand, a subsequent Resolution, squarely testing the sense of the House\r\nupon the subject, had been carried by much less than a two-thirds vote.\r\n\r\nThis latter Resolution, offered by Mr. Arnold, after conference with Mr.\r\nLincoln, with the very purpose of making a test, was in these direct\r\nterms:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the Constitution shall be so amended as to Abolish\r\nSlavery in the United States wherever it now exists, and to prohibit its\r\nexistence in every part thereof forever.\"\r\n\r\nThe vote, adopting it, was but 78 yeas to 62 nays.  * This vote,\r\ntherefore, upon the Arnold Resolution, being nowhere near the two-thirds\r\naffirmative vote necessary to secure the passage through the House of\r\nthe Senate Joint Resolution on this subject amendatory of the\r\nConstitution, was most discouraging.\r\n\r\nIt was definite enough, however, to show the necessity of a change from\r\nthe negative to the affirmative side of at least fifteen votes.  While\r\ntherefore the outlook was discouraging it was far from hopeless.  The\r\ndebate in the Senate had already had its effect upon the public mind.\r\nThat, and the utterances of Mr. Lincoln--and further discussion in the\r\nHouse, it was thought, might produce such a pressure from the loyal\r\nconstituencies both in the Free and Border Slave-States as to compel\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nBut from the very beginning of the year 1864, as if instinctively aware\r\nthat their Rebel friends were approaching the crisis of their fate, and\r\nneeded now all the help that their allies of the North could give them,\r\nthe Anti-War Democrats, in Congress, and out, had been stirring\r\nthemselves with unusual activity.\r\n\r\nIn both Houses of Congress, upon all possible occasions, they\r\nhad been striving, as they still strove, with the venom of their\r\nwidely-circulated speeches, to poison the loyal Northern and\r\nBorder-State mind, in the hope that the renomination of Mr. Lincoln\r\nmight be defeated, the chance for Democratic success at the coming\r\nPresidential election be thereby increased, and, if nothing else came\r\nof it, the Union Cause be weakened and the Rebel Cause correspondingly\r\nstrengthened.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, evidently under secret instructions from their\r\nfriends, the Conspirators in arms, they endeavored to create\r\nheart-burnings and jealousies and ill-feeling between the Eastern\r\n(especially the New England) States and the Western States, and\r\nunceasingly attacked the Protective-Tariff, Internal Revenue, the\r\nGreenback, the Draft, and every other measure or thing upon which the\r\nlife of the Union depended.\r\n\r\nMost of these Northern-Democratic agitators, \"Stealing the livery of\r\nHeaven to serve the Devil in,\" endeavored to conceal their treacherous\r\ndesigns under a veneer of gushing lip-loyalty, but that disguise was\r\n\"too thin\" to deceive either their contemporaries or those who come\r\nafter them.  Some of their language too, as well as their blustering\r\nmanner, strangely brought back to recollection the old days of Slavery\r\nwhen the plantation-whip was cracked in the House, and the air was blue\r\nwith execration of New England.\r\n\r\nSaid Voorhees, of Indiana, (January 11, 1864) when the House was\r\nconsidering a Bill \"to increase the Internal Revenue and for other\r\npurposes:\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to know whether the West has any friends upon the floor of this\r\nHouse?  We pay every dollar that is to be levied by this Tax Bill.  * *\r\n*  The Manufacturing Interest pays not a dollar into the public Treasury\r\nthat stays there.  And yet airs of patriotism are put on here by men\r\nrepresenting that interest.  I visited New England last Summer, * * *\r\nwhen I heard the swelling hum of her Manufactories, and saw those who\r\nonly a short time ago worked but a few hands, now working their\r\nthousands, and rolling up their countless wealth, I felt that it was an\r\nunhealthy prosperity.  To my mind it presented a wealth wrung from the\r\nlabor, the sinews, the bone and muscle of the men who till the soil,\r\ntaxed to an illegitimate extent to foster and support that great System\r\nof local wealth.  * * *  I do not intend to stand idly by and see one\r\nportion of the Country robbed and oppressed for the benefit of another.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the same day, replying to Mr. Morrill of Vermont, he exclaimed: \"Let\r\nhim show me that the plethoric, bloated Manufacturers of New England are\r\npaying anything to support the Government, and I will recognize it.\"\r\n\r\nWashburne, of Illinois got back at this part of Mr. Voorhees's speech\r\nrather neatly, by defending the North-west as being \"not only willing to\r\nstand taxation\" which had been \"already imposed, but * * * any\r\nadditional taxation which,\" said he, \"may be necessary to crush out this\r\nRebellion, and to hang the Rebels in the South, and the Rebel\r\nsympathizers in the North.\"  And, he pointedly added: \"Complaint has\r\nbeen made against New England.  I know that kind of talk.  I have heard\r\ntoo often that kind of slang about New England.  I heard it here for ten\r\nyears, when your Barksdales, and your Keitts's, and your other Traitors,\r\nnow in arms against the Government, filled these Halls with their\r\npestilential assaults not only upon New England, but on the Free North\r\ngenerally.\"\r\n\r\nKelley of Pennsylvania, however, more fitly characterized the speech of\r\nVoorhees, when he termed it \"a pretty, indeed a somewhat striking,\r\nparaphrase of the argument of Mr. Lamar, the Rebel Agent,--[in 1886,\r\nSecretary of the Interior]--to his confreres in Treason, as we find it\r\nin the recently published correspondence: 'Drive gold coin out of the\r\nCountry, and induce undue Importation of Foreign products so as to\r\nstrike down the Financial System.  You can have no further hope for\r\nForeign recognition.  It is evident the weight of arms is against us;\r\nand it is clear that we can only succeed by striking down the Financial\r\nSystem of the Country.' It was an admirable paraphrase of the\r\nInstructions of Mr. Lamar to the Rebel Agents in the North.\"\r\n\r\nThe impression was at this time abroad, and there were not wanting\r\nelements of proof, that certain members of Congress were trusted\r\nLieutenants of the Arch-copperhead and Outlaw, Vallandigham.  Certain it\r\nis, that many of these leaders, six months before, attended and\r\naddressed the great gathering from various parts of the Country, of\r\nnearly one hundred thousand Vallandigham-Anti-War Peace-Democrats, at\r\nSpringfield, Illinois--the very home of Abraham Lincoln--which adopted,\r\nduring a lull, when they were not yelling themselves hoarse for\r\nVallandigham, a resolution declaring against \"the further offensive\r\nprosecution of the War\" as being subversive of the Constitution and\r\nGovernment, and proposing a National Peace Convention, and, as a\r\nconsequence, Peace, \"the Union as it was,\" and, substantially such\r\nConstitutional guarantees as the Rebels might choose to demand!  And\r\nthis too, at a time (June 13, 1863), when Grant, after many recent\r\nglorious victories, had been laying siege to Vicksburg, and its Rebel\r\nArmy of 37,000 men, for nearly a month, with every reason to hope for\r\nits speedy fall.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that under such circumstances, the news of such a gathering of\r\nthe Northern Democratic sympathizers with Treason, and of their adoption\r\nof such treasonable Resolutions, should encourage the Rebels in the same\r\ndegree that Union men were disheartened!  No wonder that Lee, elated by\r\nthis and other evidences of Northern sympathy with Rebellion, at once\r\ndetermined to commence a second grand invasion of the North, and on the\r\nvery next day (June 14th,) moved Northward with all his Rebel hosts to\r\nbe welcomed, he fondly hoped, by his Northern friends of Maryland and\r\nelsewhere!  As we have seen, it took the bloody Battle of Gettysburg to\r\nundeceive him as to the character of that welcome.\r\n\r\nFurther than this, Mr. Cox had stumped Ohio, in the succeeding election,\r\nin a desperate effort to make the banished Traitor, Vallandigham--the\r\nChief Northern commander of the \"Knights of the Golden Circle\"\r\n(otherwise known as the \"Order of the Sons of Liberty,\" and \"O. A. K.\"\r\nor \"Order of American Knights\")--Governor of that great State.\r\n\r\n     [The Rebel General Sterling Price being the chief Southern\r\n     commander of this many-named treasonable organization, which in the\r\n     North alone numbered over 500,000 men.\r\n\r\n     August, 1864.--See Report of Judge Advocate Holt on certain \"Secret\r\n     Associations,\" in Appendix,]\r\n\r\nAnd it only lacked a few months of the time when quantities of copies of\r\nthe treasonable Ritual of the \"Order of American Knights\"--as well as\r\ncorrespondence touching the purchase of thousands of Garibaldi rifles\r\nfor transportation to the West--were found in the offices of leading\r\nDemocrats then in Congress.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, it is said, and repeated, that there were not wanting\r\nelements of proof, outside of Congressional utterances and actions, that\r\nleading Democrats in Congress were trusted Lieutenants of the Supreme\r\nCommander of over half a million of Northern Rebel-sympathizers bound\r\ntogether, and to secrecy, by oaths, which were declared to be paramount\r\nto all other oaths, the violation of which subjected the offender to a\r\nshameful death somewhat like that, of being \"hung, drawn, and\r\nquartered,\" which was inflicted in the middle ages for the crime of\r\nTreason to the Crown--it will be seen that the statement is supported by\r\ncircumstantial, if not by positive and direct, evidence.\r\n\r\nWhether the Coxes, the Garret Davises, the Saulsburys, the Fernando\r\nWoods, the Alexander Longs, the Allens, the Holmans, and many other\r\nprominent Congressmen of that sort,--were merely in close communion with\r\nthese banded \"Knights,\" or were actual members of their secret\r\norganizations, may be an open question.  But it is very certain that if\r\nthey all were not oath-bound members, they generally pursued the precise\r\nmethods of those who were; and that, as a rule, while they often loudly\r\nproclaimed loyalty and love for the Union, they were always ready to act\r\nas if their loyalty and love were for the so-called Confederacy.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it was one of these other \"loyal\" Democrats, who even preceded\r\nVoorhees, in raising the Sectional cry of: The West, against New\r\nEngland.  It was on this same Internal Revenue Bill, that Holman of\r\nIndiana had, the day before Voorhees's attack, said:\r\n\r\n\"If the Manufacture of the Northwest is to be taxed so heavily, a\r\ncorresponding rate of increase must be imposed on the Manufactures of\r\nNew England and Pennsylvania, or, will gentlemen tax us without limit\r\nfor the benefit of their own Section?  * * * I protest against what I\r\nbelieve is intended to be a discrimination against one Section of the\r\nCountry, by increasing the tax three-fold, without a corresponding\r\nincrease upon the burdens of other Sections.\"\r\n\r\nBut these dreadfully \"loyal\" Democrats--who did the bidding of\r\ntraitorous masters in their Treason to the Union, and thus, while\r\nposturing as \"Patriots,\" \"fired upon the rear\" of our hard-pressed\r\nArmies--were super-sensitive on this point.  And, when they could get\r\nhold of a quiet sort of a man, inclined to peaceful methods of\r\ndiscussion, how they would, terrier-like, pounce upon him, and extract\r\nfrom him, if they could, some sort of negative satisfaction!\r\n\r\nThus, for instance, on the 22nd of January, when one of these quiet men\r\n--Morris of New York--was in the midst of an inoffensive speech, Mr. Cox\r\n\"bristled up,\" and blusteringly asked whether he meant to say that he\r\n(Cox) had \"ever been the apologist or the defender of a Traitor?\"\r\n\r\nAnd Morris not having said so, mildly replied that he did \"not so\r\ncharge\"--all of which little bit of by-play hugely pleased the touchy\r\nMr. Cox, and his clansmen.\r\n\r\nBut on the day following, their smiles vanished under the words of\r\nSpalding or Ohio, who, after referring to the crocodile-tears shed by\r\nDemocratic Congressmen over the Confiscation Resolution--on the pretense\r\nthat it would hunt down \"innocent women and children\" of the Rebels,\r\nwhen they had never a word of sympathy for the widows and children of\r\nthe two hundred thousand dead soldiers of the Union-continued:\r\n\r\n\"They can see our poor soldiers return, minus an arm, minus a leg, as\r\nthey pass through these lobbies, but their only care is to protect the\r\nproperty of Rebels.  And we are asked by one of my colleagues, (Mr. Cox)\r\ndoes the gentleman from New York intend to call us Traitors?  My friend,\r\nMr. Morris, modestly answered no!  If he had asked that question of me,\r\nhe knows what my answer would have been!  I have seen Rebel officers at\r\nJohnson's Island, and I have taken them by the hand because they have\r\nfought us fairly in the field and did not seek to break down the\r\nGovernment while living under its protection.  Yes, Sir, that gentleman\r\nknows that I would have said to him that I have more respect for an open\r\nand avowed Traitor in the field, than for a sympathizer in this Hall.\r\nFour months have scarcely gone by since that gentleman and his political\r\nfriends were advocating the election of a man for the Gubernatorial\r\noffice in my State, who was an open and avowed advocate of Secession--AN\r\nOUTLAW AT THAT!\"\r\n\r\nAnd old Thaddeus Stevens--the clear-sighted and courageous \"Old\r\nCommoner\"--followed up Spalding, and struck very close to the root and\r\nanimus of the Democratic opposition, when he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"All this struggle by calm and dignified and moderate 'Patriots;' all\r\nthis clamor against 'Radicals;' all this cry of 'the Union as it Was,\r\nand the Constitution as it Is;' is but a persistent effort to\r\nreestablish Slavery, and to rivet anew and forever the chains of Bondage\r\non the limbs of Immortal beings.  May the God of Justice thwart their\r\ndesigns and paralyze their wicked efforts!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n                        \"THE FIRE IN THE REAR.\"\r\n\r\nThe treacherous purposes of professedly-loyal Copperheads being seen\r\nthrough, and promptly and emphatically denounced to the Country by Union\r\nstatesmen, the Copperheads aforesaid concluded that the profuse\r\ncirculation of their own Treason-breeding speeches--through the medium\r\nof the treasonable organizations before referred to, permeating the\r\nNorthern States,--would more than counteract all that Union men could\r\nsay or do.  Besides, the fiat had gone forth, from their Rebel masters\r\nat Richmond, to Agitate the North.\r\n\r\nHence, day after day, Democrat after Democrat, in the one House or the\r\nother, continued to air his disloyal opinions, and to utter more or less\r\nvirulent denunciations of the Government which guarded and protected\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThus, Brooks, of New York, on the 25th of January (1864), sneeringly\r\nexclaimed: \"Why, what absurdity it is to talk at this Capitol of\r\nprosecuting the War by the liberation of Slaves, when from the dome of\r\nthis building there can be heard at this hour the booming of cannon in\r\nthe distance!\"\r\n\r\nThus, also, on the day following, Fernando Wood--the same man who,\r\nwhile Mayor of New York at the outbreak of the Rebellion, had, under\r\nRebel-guidance, proposed the Secession from the Union, and the\r\nIndependence, of that great Metropolis,--declared to the House that: \"No\r\nGovernment has pursued a foe with such unrelenting, vindictive malignity\r\nas we are now pursuing those who came into the Union with us, whose\r\nblood has been freely shed on every battle-field of the Country until\r\nnow, with our own; who fought by our side in the American Revolution,\r\nand in the War of 1812 with Great Britain; who bore our banners bravest\r\nand highest in our victorious march from Vera Cruz to the City of\r\nMexico, and who but yesterday sat in these Halls contributing toward the\r\nmaintenance of our glorious institutions.\"\r\n\r\nThen he went on, in the spirit of prophecy, to declare that: \"No purely\r\nagricultural people, fighting for the protection of their own Domestic\r\nInstitutions upon their own soil, have ever yet been conquered.  I say\r\nfurther, that no revolted people have ever been subdued after they have\r\nbeen able to maintain an Independent government for three years.\"  And\r\nthen, warming up to an imperative mood, he made this explicit\r\nannouncement: \"We are at War.  * * *  Whether it be a Civil War,\r\nRebellion, Revolution, or Foreign War, it matters little.  IT MUST\r\nCEASE; and I want this Administration to tell the American People WHEN\r\nit will cease!\"  Again, only two days afterward, he took occasion to\r\ncharacterize a Bill, amendatory of the enrollment Act, as \"this\r\ninfamous, Unconstitutional conscription Act!\"\r\n\r\nC. A. White, of Ohio, was another of the malcontents who undertook, with\r\nothers of the same Copperhead faith, to \"maintain, that,\" as he\r\nexpressed it, \"the War in which we are at present engaged is wrong in\r\nitself; that the policy adopted by the Party in power for its\r\nprosecution is wrong; that the Union cannot be restored, or, if\r\nrestored, maintained, by the exercise of the coercive power of the\r\nGovernment, by War; that the War is opposed to the restoration of the\r\nUnion, destructive of the rights of the States and the liberties of the\r\nPeople.  It ought, therefore, to be brought to a speedy and immediate\r\nclose.\"\r\n\r\nIt was about this time also that, emboldened by immunity from punishment\r\nfor these utterances in the interest of armed Rebels, Edgerton of\r\nIndiana, was put forward to offer resolutions \"for Peace, upon the basis\r\nof a restoration of the Federal Union under the Constitution as it is,\"\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThereafter, in both Senate and House, such speeches by\r\nRebel-sympathizers, the aiders and abettors of Treason, grew more\r\nfrequent and more virulent than ever.  As was well said to the House,\r\nby one of the Union members from Ohio (Mr. Eckley):\r\n\r\n\"A stranger, if he listened to the debates here, would think himself in\r\nthe Confederate Congress.  I do not believe that if these Halls were\r\noccupied to-day by Davis, Toombs, Wigfall, Rhett, and Pryor, they could\r\nadd anything to the violence of assault, the falsity of accusation, or\r\nthe malignity of attack, with which the Government has been assailed,\r\nand the able, patriotic, and devoted men who are charged with its\r\nAdministration have been maligned, in both ends of the Capitol.  The\r\nclosing scenes of the Thirty-Sixth Congress, the treasonable\r\ndeclarations there made, contain nothing that we cannot hear, in the\r\nfreedom of debate, without going to Richmond or to the camps of Treason,\r\nwhere most of the actors in those scenes are now in arms against us.\"\r\n\r\nWith such a condition of things in Congress, it is not surprising that\r\nthe Richmond Enquirer announced that the North was \"distracted,\r\nexhausted, and impoverished,\" and would, \"through the agency of a strong\r\nconservative element in the Free States,\" soon treat with the Rebels \"on\r\nacceptable terms.\"\r\n\r\nThings indeed had reached such a pass, in the House of Representatives\r\nespecially, that it was felt they could not much longer go on in this\r\nmanner; that an example must be made of some one or other of these\r\nCopperheads.  But the very knowledge of the existence of such a feeling\r\nof just and patriotic irritation against the continued free utterance of\r\nsuch sentiments in the Halls of Congress, seemed only to make some of\r\nthem still more defiant.  And, when the 8th of April dawned, it was\r\nknown among all the Democrats in Congress, that Alexander Long proposed\r\nthat day to make a speech which would \"go a bow-shot beyond them all\" in\r\nuttered Treason.  He would speak right out, what the other Conspirators\r\nthought and meant, but dared not utter, before the World.\r\n\r\nA crowded floor, and packed galleries, were on hand to listen to the\r\nwritten, deliberate Treason, as it fell from his lips in the House.  His\r\nspeech began with an arraignment of the Government for treachery,\r\nincompetence, failure, tyranny, and all sorts of barbarous actions and\r\nharsh intentions, toward the Rebels--which led him to the indignant\r\nexclamation:\r\n\r\n\"Will they throw down their arms and submit to the terms?  Who shall\r\nbelieve that the free, proud American blood, which courses with as quick\r\npulsation through their veins as our own, will not be spilled to the\r\nlast drop in resistance?\"\r\n\r\nWarming up, he proceeded to say: \"Can the Union be restored by War?  I\r\nanswer most unhesitatingly and deliberately, No, never; 'War is final,\r\neternal separation.'\"\r\n\r\nHe claimed that the War was \"wrong;\" that it was waged \"in violation of\r\nthe Constitution,\" and would \"if continued, result speedily in the\r\ndestruction of the Government and the loss of Civil Liberty, and ought\r\ntherefore, to immediately cease.\"\r\n\r\nHe held also \"that the Confederate States are out of the Union,\r\noccupying the position of an Independent Power de facto; have been\r\nacknowledged as a belligerent both by Foreign Nations and our own\r\nGovernment; maintained their Declaration of Independence, for three\r\nyears, by force of arms; and the War has cut asunder all the obligations\r\nthat bound them under the Constitution.\"\r\n\r\n\"Much better,\" said he, \"would it have been for us in the beginning,\r\nmuch better would it be for us now, to consent to a division of our\r\nmagnificent Empire, and cultivate amicable relations with our estranged\r\nbrethren, than to seek to hold them to us by the power of the sword.  *\r\n* * I am reluctantly and despondingly forced to the conclusion that the\r\nUnion is lost, never to be restored.  * * * I see neither North nor\r\nSouth, any sentiment on which it is possible to build a Union.  * * * in\r\nattempting to preserve our Jurisdiction over the Southern States we have\r\nlost our Constitutional Form of Government over the Northern.  * * * The\r\nvery idea upon which this War is founded, coercion of States, leads to\r\ndespotism.  * * * I now believe that there are but two alternatives, and\r\nthey are either an acknowledgment of the Independence of the South as an\r\nindependent Nation, or their complete subjugation and extermination as a\r\nPeople; and of these alternatives I prefer the former.\"\r\n\r\nAs Long took his seat, amid the congratulations of his Democratic\r\nfriends, Garfield arose, and, to compliments upon the former's peculiar\r\ncandor and honesty, added denunciation for his Treason.  After drawing\r\nan effective parallel between Lord Fairfax and Robert E. Lee, both of\r\nwhom had cast their lots unwillingly with the enemies of this Land, when\r\nthe Wars of the Revolution and of the Rebellion respectively opened,\r\nGarfield proceeded:\r\n\r\n\"But now, when hundreds of thousands of brave souls have gone up to God\r\nunder the shadow of the Flag, and when thousands more, maimed and\r\nshattered in the Contest, are sadly awaiting the deliverance of death;\r\nnow, when three years of terrific warfare have raged over us, when our\r\nArmies have pushed the Rebellion back over mountains and rivers and\r\ncrowded it back into narrow limits, until a wall of fire girds it; now,\r\nwhen the uplifted hand of a majestic People is about to let fall the\r\nlightning of its conquering power upon the Rebellion; now, in the quiet\r\nof this Hall, hatched in the lowest depths of a similar dark Treason,\r\nthere rises a Benedict Arnold and proposes to surrender us all up, body\r\nand spirit, the Nation and the Flag, its genius and its honor, now and\r\nforever, to the accursed Traitors to our Country.  And that proposition\r\ncomes--God forgive and pity my beloved State!--it comes from a citizen\r\nof the honored and loyal Commonwealth of Ohio!  I implore you, brethren\r\nin this House, not to believe that many such births ever gave pangs to\r\nmy mother-State such as she suffered when that Traitor was born!\"\r\n\r\nAs he uttered these sturdy words, the House and galleries were agitated\r\nwith that peculiar rustling movement and low murmuring sound known as a\r\n\"sensation,\" while the Republican side with difficulty restrained the\r\napplause they felt like giving, until he sadly proceeded:\r\n\r\n\"I beg you not to believe that on the soil of that State another such\r\ngrowth has ever deformed the face of Nature and darkened the light of\r\nGod's day.\"\r\n\r\nThe hush that followed was broken by the suggestive whisper:\r\n\"Vallandigham!\"\r\n\r\n\"But, ah,\" continued the Speaker--as his voice grew sadder still--\"I am\r\nreminded that there are other such.  My zeal and love for Ohio have\r\ncarried me too far.  I retract.  I remember that only a few days since,\r\na political Convention met at the Capital of my State, and almost\r\ndecided, to select from just such material, a representative for the\r\nDemocratic Party in the coming contest; and today, what claims to be a\r\nmajority of the Democracy of that State say that they have been cheated\r\nor they would have made that choice!\"\r\n\r\n     [This refers to Horatio Seymour, the Democratic Governor of New\r\n     York.]\r\n\r\nAfter referring to the \"insidious work\" of the \"Knights of the Golden\r\nCircle\" in seeking \"to corrupt the Army and destroy its efficiency;\" the\r\n\"riots and murders which,\" said he, \"their agents are committing\r\nthroughout the Loyal North, under the lead and guidance of the Party\r\nwhose Representatives sit yonder across the aisle;\" he continued: \"and\r\nnow, just as the time is coming on when we are to select a President for\r\nthe next four years, one rises among them and fires the Beacon, throws\r\nup the blue-light--which will be seen, and rejoiced over, at the Rebel\r\nCapital in Richmond--as the signal that the Traitors in our camp are\r\norganized and ready for their hellish work!  I believe the utterance of\r\nto-day is the uplifted banner of revolt.  I ask you to mark the signal\r\nthat blazes here, and see if there will not soon appear the answering\r\nsignals of Traitors all over the Land.  * * * If these men do mean to\r\nlight the torch of War in all our homes; if they have resolved to begin\r\nthe fearful work which will redden our streets, and this Capitol, with\r\nblood, the American People should know it at once, and prepare to meet\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nAt the close of Mr. Garfield's patriotic and eloquent remarks, Mr. Long\r\nagain got the floor, declared that what he had said, he believed to be\r\nright, and he would \"stand by it,\" though he had to \"stand solitary and\r\nalone,\" and \"even if it were necessary to brave bayonets, and prisons,\r\nand all the tyranny which may be imposed by the whole power and force of\r\nthe Administration.\"\r\n\r\nSaid he: \"I have deliberately uttered my sentiments in that speech, and\r\nI will not retract one syllable of it.\"  And, to \"rub it in\" a little\r\nstronger, he exclaimed, as he took his seat, just before adjournment:\r\n\"Give me Liberty, even if confined to an Island of Greece, or a Canton\r\nof Switzerland, rather than an Empire and a Despotism as we have here\r\nto-day!\"\r\n\r\nThis treasonable speech naturally created much excitement throughout the\r\nCountry.\r\n\r\nOn the following day (Saturday, April 9, 1864), immediately after\r\nprayer, the reading of the Journal being dispensed with, the Speaker of\r\nthe House (Colfax) came down from the Speaker's Chair, and, from the\r\nfloor, offered a Preamble and Resolution, which ended thus:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That Alexander Long, a Representative from the second\r\ndistrict of Ohio, having, on the 8th day of April, 1864, declared\r\nhimself in favor of recognizing the Independence and Nationality of the\r\nso-called Confederacy now in arms against the Union, and thereby 'given\r\naid, Countenance and encouragement to persons engaged in armed hostility\r\nto the United States,' is hereby expelled.\"\r\n\r\nThe debate which ensued consumed nearly a week, and every member of\r\nprominence, on both the Republican and Democratic sides, took part in\r\nit--the Democrats almost invariably being careful to protest their own\r\nloyalty, and yet attempting to justify the braver and more candid\r\nutterances of the accused member.\r\n\r\nMr. Cox led off, April 9th, in the defense, by counterattack.  He quoted\r\nremarks made to the House (March 18, 1864) by Mr. Julian, of Indiana, to\r\nthe effect that \"Our Country, united and Free, must be saved, at\r\nwhatever hazard or cost; and nothing, not even the Constitution, must be\r\nallowed to hold back the uplifted arm of the Government in blasting the\r\npower of the Rebels forever;\"--and upon this, adopting the language of\r\nanother--[Judge Thomas, of Massachusetts.]--Mr. Cox declared that \"to\r\nmake this a War, with the sword in one hand to defend the Constitution,\r\nand a hammer in the other to break it to pieces, is no less treasonable\r\nthan Secession itself; and that, outside the pale of the Constitution,\r\nthe whole struggle is revolutionary.\"\r\n\r\nHe thought, for such words as he had just quoted, Julian ought to have\r\nbeen expelled, if those of Long justified expulsion!\r\n\r\nFinally, being pressed by Julian to define his own position, as between\r\nthe Life of the Nation, and the Infraction of the United States\r\nConstitution, Mr. Cox said: \"I will say this, that UNDER NO\r\nCIRCUMSTANCES CONCEIVABLE BY THE HUMAN MIND WOULD I EVER VIOLATE THAT\r\nCONSTITUTION FOR ANY PURPOSE!\"\r\n\r\nThis sentiment was loudly applauded, and received with cries of \"THAT IS\r\nIT!\"  \"THAT'S IT!\" by the Democratic side of the House, apparently in\r\nutter contempt for the express and emphatic declaration of Jefferson\r\nthat: \"A strict observance of the written laws is doubtless one of the\r\nhighest duties of a good citizen, but it is not the highest.  The laws\r\nof Necessity, of Self-preservation, of SAVING OUR COUNTRY WHEN IN\r\nDANGER, are of higher obligation.  To LOSE OUR COUNTRY by a scrupulous\r\nadherence to written law WOULD BE TO LOSE THE LAW ITSELF, with Life,\r\nLiberty, Property, and all those who are enjoying them with us; thus\r\nabsolutely SACRIFICING THE END TO THE MEANS.\"\r\n\r\n     [In a letter to J.  B.  Colvin, Sept.  20, 1810, quoted at the time\r\n     for their information, and which may be found at page 542 of vol.\r\n     v., of Jefferson's Works.]\r\n\r\nIndeed these extreme sticklers for the letter of the Constitution, who\r\nwould have sacrificed Country, kindred, friends, honesty, truth, and all\r\nambitions on Earth and hopes for Heaven, rather than violate it--for\r\nthat is what Mr. Cox's announcement and the Democratic endorsement of it\r\nmeant, if they meant anything--were of the same stripe as those\r\nquerulous Ancients, for the benefit of whom the Apostle wrote: \"For THE\r\nLETTER KILLETH, but the Spirit giveth life.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now, inspired apparently by the reckless utterances\r\nof Long, if not by the more cautious diatribe of Cox, Harris of\r\nMaryland, determining if possible to outdo them all, not only declared\r\nthat he was willing to go with his friend Long wherever the House chose\r\nto send him, but added: \"I am a peace man, a radical peace man; and I am\r\nfor Peace by the recognition of the South, for the recognition of the\r\nSouthern Confederacy; and I am for acquiescence in the doctrine of\r\nSecession.\"  And, said he, in the midst of the laughter which followed\r\nthe sensation his treasonable words occasioned, \"Laugh as you may, you\r\nhave got to come to it!\"  And then, with that singular obfuscation of\r\nideas engendered, in the heads of their followers, by the astute\r\nRebel-sympathizing leaders, he went on:\r\n\r\n\"I am for Peace, and I am for Union too.  I am as good a Union man as\r\nany of you.  [Laughter.] I am a better Union man than any of you!\r\n[Great Laughter.] * * * I look upon War as Disunion.\"\r\n\r\nAfter declaring that, if the principle of the expulsion Resolution was\r\nto be carried out, his \"friend,\" Mr. Long, \"would be a martyr in a\r\nglorious cause\"--he proceeded to announce his own candidacy for\r\nexpulsion, in the following terms:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Speaker, in the early part of this Secession movement, there was a\r\nResolution offered, pledging men and money to carry on the War.  My\r\nprinciples were then, and are now, against the War.  I stood, solitary\r\nand alone, in voting against that Resolution, and whenever a similar\r\nproposition is brought here it will meet with my opposition.  Not one\r\ndollar, nor one man, I swear, by the Eternal, will I vote for this\r\ninfernal, this stupendous folly, more stupendous than ever disgraced any\r\ncivilized People on the face of God's Earth.  If that be Treason, make\r\nthe most of it!\r\n\r\n\"The South asked you to let them go in peace.  But no, you said you\r\nwould bring them into subjugation.  That is not done yet, and God\r\nAlmighty grant that it never may be.  I hope that you will never\r\nsubjugate the South.  If she is to be ever again in the Union, I hope it\r\nwill be with her own consent; and I hope that that consent will be\r\nobtained by some other mode than by the sword.  'If this be Treason,\r\nmake the most of it!'\"\r\n\r\nAn extraordinary scene at once occurred--Mr. Tracy desiring \"to know\r\nwhether, in these Halls, the gentleman from Maryland invoked Almighty\r\nGod that the American Arms should not prevail?\"  \"Whether such language\r\nis not Treason?\" and \"whether it is in order to talk Treason in this\r\nHall?\"--his patriotic queries being almost drowned in the incessant\r\ncries of \"Order!\"  \"Order!\"  and great disorder, and confusion, on the\r\nDemocratic side of the House.\r\n\r\nFinally the treasonable language was taken down by the Clerk, and, while\r\na Resolution for the expulsion of Mr. Harris was being written out, Mr.\r\nFernando Wood--coming, as he said, from a bed of \"severe sickness,\"\r\nquoted the language used by Mr. Long, to wit:\r\n\r\n\"I now believe there are but two alternatives, and they are either the\r\nacknowledgment of the Independence of the South as an independent\r\nNation, or their complete subjugation and extermination as a People; and\r\nof these alternatives I prefer the former\"--and declared that \"if he is\r\nto be expelled for the utterance of that sentiment, you may include me\r\nin it, because I concur fully in that sentiment.\"\r\n\r\n     [He afterwards (April 11,) said he did not agree with Mr. Long's\r\n     opinions.]\r\n\r\nEvery effort was unavailingly made by the Democrats, under the lead of\r\nMessrs. Cox--[In 1886 American Minister at Constantinople.]--and\r\nPendleton,--[In 1886 American Minister at Berlin.]--to prevent action\r\nupon the new Resolution of expulsion, which was in these words:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, Hon. Benjamin G. Harris, a member of the House of\r\nRepresentatives of the United States from the State of Maryland, has on\r\nthis day used the following language, to wit: 'The South asked you to\r\nlet them go in peace.  But no; you said you would bring them into\r\nsubjection.  That is not done yet, and God Almighty grant that it never\r\nmay be.  I hope that you will never subjugate the South.'  And whereas,\r\nsuch language is treasonable, and is a gross disrespect of this House:\r\nTherefore, 'Be it Resolved, That the said Benjamin G. Harris be expelled\r\nfrom this House.'\"\r\n\r\nUpon reaching a vote, however, the Resolution was lost, there being only\r\n81 yeas, to 58 (Democratic) nays--two-thirds not having voted\r\naffirmatively.  Subsequently, despite Democratic efforts to obstruct, a\r\nResolution, declaring Harris to be \"an unworthy Member\" of the House,\r\nand \"severely\" censuring him, was adopted.\r\n\r\nThe debate upon the Long-expulsion Resolution now proceeded, and its\r\nmover, in view of the hopelessness of securing a two-thirds affirmative\r\nvote, having accepted an amendment comprising other two Resolutions and\r\na Preamble, the question upon adopting these was submitted on the 14th\r\nof April.  They were in the words following:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, ALEXANDER LONG, a Representative from the second district of\r\nOhio, by his open declarations in the National Capitol, and publications\r\nin the City of New York, has shown himself to be in favor of a\r\nrecognition of the so-called Confederacy now trying to establish itself\r\nupon the ruins of our Country, thereby giving aid and comfort to the\r\nEnemy in that destructive purpose--aid to avowed Traitors, in creating\r\nan illegal Government within our borders, comfort to them by assurances\r\nof their success and affirmations of the justice of their Cause; and\r\nwhereas, such conduct is at the same time evidence of disloyalty, and\r\ninconsistent with his oath of office, and his duty as a Member of this\r\nBody: Therefore,\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the said Alexander Long, a Representative from the\r\nsecond district of Ohio, be, and he is hereby declared to be an unworthy\r\nMember of the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the Speaker shall read these Resolutions to the said\r\nAlexander Long during the session of the House.\"\r\n\r\nThe first of these Resolutions was adopted, by 80 yeas to 69 nays; the\r\nsecond was tabled, by 71 yeas to 69 nays; and the Preamble was agreed\r\nto, by 78 yeas to 63 nays.\r\n\r\nAnd, among the 63 Democrats, who were not only unwilling to declare\r\nAlexander Long \"an unworthy Member,\" or to have the Speaker read such a\r\ndeclaration to him in a session of the House, but also refused by their\r\nvotes even to intimate that his conduct evidenced disloyalty, or gave\r\naid and comfort to the Enemy, were the names of such democrats as Cox,\r\nEldridge, Holman, Kernan, Morrisson, Pendleton, Samuel J. Randall,\r\nVoorhees, and Fernando Wood.\r\n\r\nHence Mr. Long not only escaped expulsion for his treasonable\r\nutterances, but did not even receive the \"severe censure\" which, in\r\naddition to being declared (like himself) \"an unworthy Member,\" had been\r\nvoted to Mr. Harris for recklessly rushing into the breach to help him!\r\n\r\n     [The Northern Democracy comprised two well-recognized classes: The\r\n     Anti-War (or Peace) Democrats, commonly called \"Copperheads,\" who\r\n     sympathized with the Rebellion, and opposed the War for the Union;\r\n     and the War (or Union) Democrats, who favored a vigorous\r\n     prosecution of the War for the preservation of the Union.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n             \"THIRTEENTH AMENDMENT\" DEFEATED IN THE HOUSE.\r\n\r\nThe debate in the House of Representatives, upon the Thirteenth\r\nAmendment to the Constitution--interrupted by the treasonable episode\r\nreferred to in the last Chapter--was subsequently resumed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, Fort Pillow had been stormed, and its garrison of\r\nWhites and Blacks, massacred.\r\n\r\nAnd now commenced the beginning of the end-so far as the Military aspect\r\nof the Rebellion was concerned.  Early in May, Sherman's Atlanta\r\nCampaign commenced, and, simultaneously, General Grant began his\r\nmovement toward Richmond.  In quick succession came the news of the\r\nbloody battles of the Wilderness, and those around Spottsylvania, Va.;\r\nat Buzzard Roost Gap, Snake Creek Gap, and Dalton, Ga.; Drury's Bluff,\r\nVa.; Resaca, Ga.; the battles of the North Anna, Va.; those around\r\nDallas, and New Hope church, Ga; the crossing of Grant's forces to the\r\nSouth side of the James and the assault on Petersburg.  While the Union\r\nArmies were thus valiantly attacking and beating those of the Rebels, on\r\nmany a sanguinary field the loyal men of the North, both in and out of\r\nCongress, pressed for favorable action upon the Thirteenth Amendment.\r\n\"Friends of the wounded in Fredericksburg from the Battle of the\r\nWilderness\"--exclaimed Horace Greeley in the New York Tribune, of May\r\n31st,--\"friends and relatives of the soldiers of Grant's Army beyond the\r\nWilderness, let us all join hands and swear upon our Country's altar\r\nthat we will never cease this War until African Slavery in the United\r\nStates is dead forever, and forever buried!\"\r\n\r\nPeace Democrats, however, were deaf to all such entreaties.  On the very\r\nsame day, Mr. Holman, in the House, objected even to the second reading\r\nof the Joint Resolution Amendatory of the Constitution, and there were\r\nso many \"Peace Democrats\" to back him, that the vote was: 55 yeas to 76\r\nnays, on the question \"shall the Joint Resolution be rejected!\"\r\n\r\nThe old cry, that had been repeated by Hendricks and others, in the\r\nSenate and House, time and again, was still used--threadbare though it\r\nwas--\"this is not the right time for it!\"  On this very day, for\r\ninstance, Mr. Herrick said: \"I ask if this is the proper time for our\r\nPeople to consider so grave a measure as the Amendment of the\r\nConstitution in so vital a point?  * * * this is no fitting time for\r\nsuch work.\"\r\n\r\nVery different was the attitude of Kellogg, of New York, and well did he\r\nshow up the depths to which the Democracy--the Peace Democracy--had now\r\nfallen.  \"We are told,\" said he, \"of a War Democracy, and such there\r\nare--their name is legion--good men and true; they are found in the\r\nUnion ranks bearing arms in support of the Government and the\r\nAdministration that wields it.  At the ballot-box, whether at home or in\r\nthe camp, they are Union men, and vote as they fight, and hold little in\r\ncommon with the political leaders of the Democratic Party in or out of\r\nthis Hall--the Seymours, the Woods, the Vallandighams, the Woodwards,\r\nand their indorsers, who hold and control the Democratic Party here, and\r\ntaint it with Treason, till it is a stench in the nostrils of all\r\npatriotic men.\"\r\n\r\nAfter referring to the fact that the leaders of the Rebellion had from\r\nthe start relied confidently upon assistance from the Northern\r\nDemocracy, he proceeded:\r\n\r\n\"The Peace Democracy, and mere Party-hacks in the North, are fulfilling\r\ntheir masters' expectations industriously, unceasingly, and as far as in\r\nthem lies.  Not even the shouts for victory, in these Halls, can divert\r\ntheir Southern allies here.  A sullen gloom at the defeat and\r\ndiscomfiture of their Southern brethren settles down on their disastrous\r\ncountenances, from which no ray of joy can be reflected.  * * *  They\r\neven vote solid against a law to punish guerrillas.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" continued he, \"in my judgment, many of those who withhold from\r\ntheir Country the support they would otherwise give, find allegiance to\r\nParty too strong for their patriotism.  * * *  Rejecting the example and\r\ncounsels of Stanton and Dickinson and Butler and Douglas and Dix and\r\nHolt and Andrew Johnson and Logan and Rosecrans and Grant and a host of\r\nothers, all Democrats of the straightest sect, to forget all other ties,\r\nand cleave only to their Country for their Country's sake, and rejecting\r\nthe overtures and example of the Republican Party to drop and forget\r\ntheir Party name, that all might unite and band together for their\r\nCountry's salvation as Union men, they turn a deaf ear and cold\r\nshoulder, and sullenly pass by on the other side, thanking God they are\r\nnot as other men are, and lend, if at all, a calculating, qualified, and\r\nconditional and halting support, under protest, to their Country's\r\ncause; thus justifying the only hope of the Rebellion to-day, that Party\r\nspirit at the North will distract its counsels, divide and discourage\r\nand palsy its efforts, and ultimately make way for the Traitor and the\r\nparricide to do their worst.\"\r\n\r\nBesides the set speeches made against the proposed\r\nConstitutional amendment in the House, Peace-Democrats of the Senate\r\ncontinued to keep up a running fire at it in that Chamber, on every\r\npossible occasion.  Garrett Davis was especially garrulous on the\r\nsubject, and also launched the thunders of his wrath at the President\r\nquite frequently and even vindictively.  For instance, speaking in the\r\nSenate--[May 31,1864,]--of the right of Property in Slaves; said he:\r\n\r\n\"This new-born heresy 'Military Necessity,' as President Lincoln claims,\r\nand exercises it, is the sum of all political and Military villainies\r\n* * * and it is no less absurd than it is villainous.  * * * The man\r\nhas never spoken or lived who can prove by any provision of the\r\nConstitution, or by any principle, or by any argument to be deduced\r\nlogically and fairly from it, that he has any such power as this vast,\r\ngigantic, all-conquering and all-crushing power of Military Necessity\r\nwhich he has the audacity to claim.\r\n\r\n\"This modern Emperor, this Tiberius, a sort of a Tiberius, and his\r\nSejanus, a sort of a Sejanus, the head of the War Department, are\r\norganizing daily their Military Courts to try civilians.  * * *\r\n\r\n\"Sir, I want one labor of love before I die.  I want the President of\r\nthe United States, I want his Secretary of War, I want some of his high\r\nofficers in Military command to bring a civilian to a Military\r\nexecution, and me to have the proud privilege of prosecuting them for\r\nmurder.  * * * I want the law and its just retribution to be visited\r\nupon these great delinquents.\r\n\r\n\"I would sooner, if I had the power, bring about such an atonement as\r\nthat, than I would even put down the Rebellion.  It would be a greater\r\nvictory in favor of Freedom and Constitutional Liberty, a thousand-fold,\r\nof all the People of America besides, than the subjugation of the Rebel\r\nStates could possibly be.\"\r\n\r\nBut there seemed to be no end to the' attacks upon the Administration,\r\nmade, in both Houses, by these peculiar Peace-Democrats.  Union blood\r\nmight flow in torrents on the fields of the rebellious South, atrocities\r\ninnumerable might be committed by the Rebels, cold-blooded massacres of\r\nBlacks and Whites, as at Fort Pillow, might occur without rebuke from\r\nthem; but let the Administration even dare to sneeze, and--woe to the\r\nAdministration.\r\n\r\nIt was not the Thirteenth Amendment only, that they assailed, but\r\neverything else which the Administration thought might help it in its\r\neffort to put down the Rebellion.  Nor was it so much their malignant\r\nactivity in opposition to any one measure intended to strengthen the\r\nhands of the Union, but to all such measures; and superadded to this was\r\nthe incessant bringing forward, in both Houses of Congress, by these\r\nrestless Rebel-sympathizers, of Peace-Resolutions, the mere presentation\r\nof which would be, and were, construed by the Rebel authorities at\r\nRichmond, as evidences of a weakening.\r\n\r\nEven some of the best of the Peace-Democrats, like S. S.  Cox, for\r\ninstance, not only assailed the Tariff--under which the Union Republican\r\nParty sought to protect and build up American Industry, as well as to\r\nraise as much revenue as possible to help meet the enormous current\r\nexpenditures of the Government--but also denounced our great paper-money\r\nsystem, which alone enabled us to secure means to meet all deficiencies\r\nin the revenues otherwise obtained, and thus to ultimately conquer the\r\nhosts of Rebellion.\r\n\r\nHe declared (June 2, 1864) that \"The People are the victims of the\r\njoint-robbery of a system of bounties under the guise of duties, and of\r\nan inconvertible and depreciated paper currency under the guise of\r\nmoney,\" and added: \"No man is now so wise and gifted that he can save\r\nthis Nation from bankruptcy.  * * *  No borrowing system can save us.\r\nThe scheme of making greenbacks a legal tender, which enabled the debtor\r\nto cheat his creditor, thereby playing the old game of kingcraft, to\r\ndebase the currency in order to aid the designs of despotism, may float\r\nus for a while amidst the fluctuations and bubbles of the day; but as no\r\none possesses the power to repeal the Law of the Almighty, which decrees\r\n(and as our Constitution has established) that gold and silver shall be\r\nthe standard of value in the World, so they will ever thus remain,\r\nnotwithstanding the legislation of Congress.\"\r\n\r\nNot satisfied with this sort of \"fire in the rear,\" it was attempted by\r\nmeans of Democratic Free-Trade and antipaper-currency sophistries, to\r\narouse jealousies, heart-burnings and resentful feelings in the breasts\r\nof those living in different parts of the Union--to implant bitter\r\nSectional antagonisms and implacable resentments between the Eastern\r\nStates, on the one hand, and the Western States, on the other--and thus,\r\nby dividing, to weaken the Loyal Union States.\r\n\r\nThat this was the cold-blooded purpose of all who pursued this course,\r\nwould no doubt be warmly denied by some of them; but the fact remains no\r\nless clear, that the effect of that course, whether so intended or not,\r\nwas to give aid and comfort to the Enemy at that critical time when the\r\nNation most needed all the men, money, and moral as well as material\r\nsupport, it was possible to get, to put an end to the bloody Rebellion,\r\nnow--under the continuous poundings of Grant's Army upon that of Lee in\r\nVirginia, and the advance of Sherman's Army upon that of Johnston in\r\nGeorgia--tottering to its overthrow. Thus this same speaker (S. S. Cox),\r\nin his untimely speech, undertook to divide the Union-loving States\r\n\"into two great classes: the Protected States and the Unprotected\r\nStates;\" and--having declared that \"The Manufacturing States, mainly the\r\nNew England States and Pennsylvania, are the Protected States,\" and \"The\r\nAgricultural States,\" mainly the eleven Western States, which he named,\r\n\"are the Unprotected States\"--proceeded to intemperately and violently\r\narraign New England, and especially Massachusetts, in the same way that\r\nhad years before been adopted by the old Conspirators of the South when\r\nthey sought--alas, too successfully!--to inflame the minds of Southern\r\ncitizens to a condition of unreasoning frenzy which made attempted\r\nNullification and subsequent armed Rebellion and Secession possible.\r\n\r\nWell might the thoroughly loyal Grinnell, of Iowa--after exposing what\r\nhe termed the \"sophistry of figures\" by which Mr. Cox had seen fit \"to\r\nmisrepresent and traduce\" the Western States-exclaim: \"Sir, I have no\r\nwords which I can use to execrate sufficiently such language, in\r\narraying the Sections in opposition during a time of War; as if we were\r\nnot one People, descended from one stock, having one interest, and bound\r\nup in one destiny!\"\r\n\r\nThe damage that might have been done to the Union Cause by such\r\nmalignant Democratic attacks upon the National unity and strength, may\r\nbe imagined when we reflect that at this very time the annual expenses\r\nof our Government were over $600,000,000, and growing still larger; and\r\nthat $1.90 in legal tender notes of the United States was worth but\r\n$1.00 in gold, with a downward tendency.  Said stern old Thaddeus\r\nStevens, alluding on this occasion, to Statesmanship of the peculiar\r\nstamp of the Coxes and Fernando Woods: \"He who in this time will pursue\r\nsuch a course of argument for the mere sake of party, can never hope to\r\nbe ranked among Statesmen; nay, Sir, he will not even rise to the\r\ndignity of a respectable Demagogue!\"\r\n\r\nWithin a week after this, (June 9, 1864), we find in the Senate also,\r\nsimilarly insidious attacks upon the strength of the Government, made by\r\ncertain Northern Democrats, who never tired of undermining Loyalty, and\r\ncreating and spreading discontent among the People.  The Bill then up,\r\nfor consideration, was one \"to prohibit the discharge of persons from\r\nliability to Military duty, by reason of the payment of money.\"\r\n\r\nIn the terribly bloody Campaign that had now been entered upon by Grant\r\n--in the West, under Sherman, and in the East, under his own personal\r\neye--it was essential to send to the front, every man possible.  Hence\r\nthe necessity for a Bill of this sort, which moreover provided, in order\r\nas far as possible to popularize conscription, that all calls for drafts\r\ntheretofore made under the Enrolling Act of March 3, 1863, should be for\r\nnot over one year's service, etc.\r\n\r\nThis furnished the occasion for Mr. Hendricks, among other Peace\r\nDemocrats, to make opposing speeches.  He, it seems, had all along been\r\nopposed to drafting Union soldiers; and because, during the previous\r\nWinter, the Senate had been unwilling to abolish the clause permitting a\r\ndrafted man to pay a commutation of $300 (with which money a substitute\r\ncould be procured) instead of himself going, at a time when men were not\r\nquite so badly needed as now, therefore Mr. Hendricks pretended to think\r\nit very strange and unjustifiable that now, when everything depended on\r\ngetting every possible man in the field, the Senate should think of\r\n\"abandoning that which it thought right last Winter!\"\r\n\r\nHe opposed drafting; but if drafting must be resorted to, then he\r\nthought that what he termed \"the Horror of the Draft\" should be felt by\r\nas many of the Union people as possible!--or, in his own words: \"the\r\nHorror of the Draft ought to be divided among the People.\"  As if this\r\nwere not sufficient to conjure dreadful imaginings, he added: \"if one\r\nset of men are drafted this year to serve twelve months, and they have\r\nto go because the power of the Government makes them go, whether they\r\ncan go well or not, then at the end of the year their neighbors should\r\nbe subjected to the same Horror, and let this dreadful demand upon the\r\nservice, upon the blood, and upon the life of the People be distributed\r\nupon all.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, in order apparently to still further intensify public feeling\r\nagainst all drafting, and sow the seeds of dissatisfaction in the hearts\r\nof those drafted at this critical time, when the fate of the Union and\r\nof Republican Government palpably depended upon conscription, he added:\r\n\"It is not so right to say to twenty men in a neighborhood: 'You shall\r\ngo; you shall leave your families whether you can or not; you shall go\r\nwithout the privilege of commutation whether you leave starving wives\r\nand children behind you or not,' and then say to every other man of the\r\nneighborhood: 'Because we have taken these twenty men for three years,\r\nyou shall remain with your wives and children safely and comfortably at\r\nhome for these three years.'  I like this feature of the amendment,\r\nbecause it distributes the Horror of the Draft more equally and justly\r\nover the whole People.\"\r\n\r\nNot satisfied with rolling the \"Horror of the Draft\" so often and\r\ntrippingly over his tongue, he also essayed the role of Prophet in the\r\ninterest of the tottering god of Slavery.  \"The People,\" said he,\r\n\"expect great results from this Campaign; and when another year comes\r\nrolling around, and it is found that this War is not closed, and that\r\nthere is no reasonable probability of its early close, my colleague\r\n(Lane) and other Senators who agree with him will find that the People\r\nwill say that this effusion of blood must stop; that THERE MUST BE SOME\r\nADJUSTMENT.  I PROPHESY THIS.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, as a further declaration likely to give aid and comfort to the\r\nRebel leaders, he said: \"I do not believe many men are going to be\r\nobtained by a draft; I do not believe a very good Army will be got by a\r\ndraft; I do not believe an Army will be put in the field, by a draft,\r\nthat will whip General Lee.\"\r\n\r\nBut while all such statements were, no doubt, intended to help the foes\r\nof the Union, and dishearten or dismay its friends, the really loyal\r\nPeople, understanding their fell object, paid little heed to them.  The\r\npredictions of these Prophets of evil fell flat upon the ears of lovers\r\nof their Country.  Conspirators, however much they might masquerade in\r\nthe raiment of Loyalty, could not wholly conceal the ear-marks of\r\nTreason.  The hand might be the hand of Esau, but the voice was the\r\nvoice of Jacob.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of June--after a month of terrific and bloody fighting\r\nbetween the immediate forces of Grant and Lee--a dispatch from Sherman,\r\njust received at Washington, was read to the House of Representatives,\r\nwhich said: \"The Enemy is not in our immediate front, but his signals\r\nare seen at Lost Mountain, and Kenesaw.\"  So, at the same time, at the\r\nNational Capital, while the friends of the Union there, were not\r\nimmediately confronted with an armed Enemy, yet the signals of his\r\nAllies could be seen, and their fire upon our rear could be heard, daily\r\nand almost hourly, both in the Senate and the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nThe fight in the House, upon the Thirteenth Amendment, now seemed\r\nindeed, to be reaching a climax.  During the whole of June 14th, until\r\nmidnight, speech after speech on the subject, followed each other in\r\nrapid succession.  Among the opposition speeches, perhaps those of\r\nFernando Wood and Holman were most notable for extravagant and\r\nunreasoning denunciation of the Administration and Party in power--whose\r\nevery effort was put forth, and strained at this very time to the\r\nutmost, to save the Union.\r\n\r\nHolman, for instance, declared that, \"Of all the measures of this\r\ndisastrous Administration, each in its turn producing new calamities,\r\nthis attempt to tamper with the Constitution threatens the most\r\npermanent injury.\"  He enumerated the chief measures of the\r\nAdministration during its three and a half years of power-among them the\r\nEmancipation Proclamation, the arming of the Blacks, and what he\r\nsneeringly termed \"their pet system of finance\" which was to \"sustain\r\nthe public credit for infinite years,\" but which \"even now,\" said he,\r\n\"totters to its fall!\"  And then, having succeeded in convincing himself\r\nof Republican failure, he exultingly exclaimed: \"But why enumerate?\r\nWhat measure of this Administration has failed to be fatal!  Every step\r\nin your progress has been a mistake.  I use the mildest terms of\r\ncensure!\"\r\n\r\nFernando Wood, in his turn also, \"mildly\" remarked upon Republican\r\npolicy as \"the bloody and brutal policy of the Administration Party.\"\r\nHe considered this \"the crisis of the fate of the Union;\" declared that\r\nSlavery was \"the best possible condition to insure the happiness of the\r\nNegro race\"--a position which, on the following day, he \"reaffirmed\"\r\n--and characterized those members of the Democratic Party who saw Treason\r\nin the ways and methods and expressions of Peace Democrats of his own\r\nstamp, as a \"pack of political jackals known as War Democrats.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of June, Farnsworth made a reply to Ross--who had claimed to\r\nbe friendly to the Union soldier--in which the former handled the\r\nDemocratic Party without gloves.  \"What,\" said he, referring to Mr.\r\nRoss, \"has been the course of that gentleman and his Party on this floor\r\nin regard to voting supplies to the Army?  What has been their course in\r\nregard to raising money to pay the Army?  His vote will be found\r\nrecorded in almost every instance against the Appropriation Bills,\r\nagainst ways and means for raising money to pay the Army.  It is only a\r\nweek ago last Monday, that a Bill was introduced here to punish\r\nguerrillas * * *  and how did my colleague vote?  Against the Bill.* * *\r\nOn the subject of arming Slaves, of putting Negroes into the Army, how\r\nhas my colleague and his Party voted?  Universally against it.  They\r\nwould strip from the backs of these Black soldiers, now in the service\r\nof the Country, their uniforms, and would send them back to Slavery with\r\nchains and manacles.  And yet they are the friends of the soldier!\"* * *\r\n\"On the vote to repeal the Fugitive Slave Law, how did that (Democratic)\r\nside of the House vote?  Does not the Fugitive Slave Law affect the\r\nBlack soldier in the Army who was a Slave?  That side of the House are\r\nin favor of continuing the Fugitive Slave Law, and of disbanding Colored\r\ntroops.  How did that side of the House vote on the question of arming\r\nSlaves and paying them as soldiers?  They voted against it.  They are in\r\nfavor of disbanding the Colored regiments, and, armed with the Fugitive\r\nSlave Law, sending them back to their masters!\"\r\n\r\nHe took occasion also to meet various Democratic arguments against the\r\nResolution,--among them, one, hinging on the alleged right of Property\r\nin Slaves.  This was a favorite idea with the Border-State men\r\nespecially, that Slaves were Property--mere chattels as it were,--and,\r\nonly the day before, a Northern man, Coffroth of Pennsylvania, had said:\r\n\r\n\"Sir, we should pause before proceeding any further in this\r\nUnconstitutional and censurable legislation.  The mere abolition of\r\nSlavery is not my cause of complaint.  I care not whether Slavery is\r\nretained or abolished by the people of the States in which it exists\r\n--the only rightful authority.  The question to me is, has Congress a\r\nright to take from the people of the South their Property; or, in other\r\nwords, having no pecuniary interest therein, are we justified in freeing\r\nthe Slave-property of others?  Can we Abolish Slavery in the Loyal State\r\nof Kentucky against her will?  If this Resolution should pass, and be\r\nratified by three-fourths of the States--States already Free--and\r\nKentucky refuses to ratify it, upon what principle of right or law would\r\nwe be justified in taking this Slave-property of the people of Kentucky?\r\nWould it be less than stealing?\"\r\n\r\nAnd Farnsworth met this idea--which had also been advanced by Messrs.\r\nRoss, Fernando Wood, and Pruyn--by saying: \"What constitutes property?\r\nI know it is said by some gentlemen on the other side, that what the\r\nstatute makes property, is property.  I deny it.  What 'vested right'\r\nhas any man or State in Property in Man?  We of the North hold property,\r\nnot by virtue of statute law, not by virtue of enactments.  Our property\r\nconsists in lands, in chattels, in things.  Our property was made\r\nproperty by Jehovah when He gave Man dominion over it.  But nowhere did\r\nHe give dominion of Man over Man.  Our title extends back to the\r\nfoundation of the World.  That constitutes property.  There is where we\r\nget our title.  There is where we get our 'vested rights' to property.\"\r\n\r\nTouching the ethics of Slavery, Mr. Arnold's speech on the same occasion\r\nwas also able, and in parts eloquent, as where he said: 'Slavery is\r\nto-day an open enemy striking at the heart of the Republic.  It is the\r\nsoul and body, the spirit and motive of the Rebellion.  It is Slavery\r\nwhich marshals yonder Rebel hosts, which confront the patriot Armies\r\nof Grant and Sherman.  It is the savage spirit of this barbarous\r\nInstitution which starves the Union prisoners at Richmond, which\r\nassassinates them at Fort Pillow, which murders the wounded on the field\r\nof battle, and which fills up the catalogue of wrong and outrage which\r\nmark the conduct of the Rebels during all this War.\r\n\r\n\"In view of all the long catalogue of wrongs which Slavery has inflicted\r\nupon the Country, I demand to-day, of the Congress of the United States,\r\nthe death of African Slavery.  We can have no permanent Peace, while\r\nSlavery lives.  It now reels and staggers toward its last death-struggle.\r\nLet us strike the monster this last decisive blow.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, after appealing to both Border-State men, and Democrats of the Free\r\nStates, not to stay the passage of this Resolution which \"will strike\r\nthe Rebellion at the heart,\" he continued: \"Gentlemen may flatter\r\nthemselves with a restoration of the Slave-power in this Country.  'The\r\nUnion as it was!'  It is a dream, never again to be realized.  The\r\nAmerica of the past, has gone forever.  A new Nation is to be born from\r\nthe agony through which the People are now passing.  This new Nation is\r\nto be wholly Free.  Liberty, Equality before the Law, is to be the great\r\nCorner-stone.\"\r\n\r\nSo, too, Mr. Ingersoll eloquently said--among many other good things:\r\n--\"It is well to eradicate an evil.  That Slavery is an evil, no sane,\r\nhonest man will deny.  It has been the great curse of this Country from\r\nits infancy to the present hour, And now that the States in Rebellion\r\nhave given the Loyal States the opportunity to take off that curse, to\r\nwipe away the foul stain, I say let it be done.  We owe it to ourselves;\r\nwe owe it to posterity; we owe it to the Slaves themselves to\r\nexterminate Slavery forever by the adoption of the proposed Amendment to\r\nthe Constitution.  * * *  I believe Slavery is the mother of this\r\nRebellion, that this Rebellion can be attributed to no other cause but\r\nSlavery; from that it derived its life, and gathers its strength to-day.\r\nDestroy the mother, and the child dies.  Destroy the cause, and the\r\neffect will disappear.\r\n\r\n\"Slavery has ever been the enemy of liberal principles.  It has ever\r\nbeen the friend of ignorance, prejudice, and all the unlawful, savage,\r\nand detestable passions which proceed therefrom.  It has ever been\r\ndomineering, arrogant, exacting, and overbearing.  It has claimed to be\r\na polished aristocrat, when in reality it has only been a coarse,\r\nswaggering, and brutal boor.  It has ever claimed to be a gentleman,\r\nwhen in reality it has ever been a villain.  I think it is high time to\r\nclip its overgrown pretensions, strip it of its mask, and expose it, in\r\nall its hideous deformity, to the detestation of all honest and\r\npatriotic men.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Samuel J.  Randall had, at a somewhat later hour, pathetically\r\nand poetically invoked the House, in its collective unity, as a\r\n\"Woodman,\" to \"spare that tree\" of the Constitution, and to \"touch not a\r\nsingle bough,\" because, among other reasons, \"in youth it sheltered\"\r\nhim; and furthermore, because \"the time\" was \"most inopportune;\" and,\r\nafter Mr. Rollins, of Missouri, had made a speech, which he afterward\r\nsuppressed; Mr. Pendleton closed the debate in an able effort, from his\r\npoint of view, in which he objected to the passage of the Joint\r\nResolution because \"the time is not auspicious;\" because, said he, \"it\r\nis impossible that the Amendment proposed, should be ratified without a\r\nfraudulent use of the power to admit new States, or a fraudulent use of\r\nthe Military power of the Federal Government in the Seceded States,\"\r\n--and, said he, \"if you should attempt to amend the Constitution by such\r\nmeans, what binding obligation would it have?\"\r\n\r\nHe objected, also, because \"the States cannot, under the pretense of\r\namending the Constitution, subvert the structure, spirit, and theory of\r\nthis Government.\"  \"But,\" said he, \"if this Amendment were within the\r\nConstitutional power of amendment; if this were a proper time to\r\nconsider it; if three-fourths of the States were willing to ratify it;\r\nand if it did not require the fraudulent use of power, either in this\r\nHouse or in the Executive Department, to secure its adoption, I would\r\nstill resist the passage of this Resolution.  It is another step toward\r\nconsolidation, and consolidation is Despotism; confederation is\r\nLiberty.\"\r\n\r\nIt was about 4 o'clock in the afternoon of June 15th, that the House\r\ncame to a vote, on the passage of the Joint Resolution.  At first the\r\nstrain of anxiety on both sides was great, but, as the roll proceeded,\r\nit soon became evident that the Resolution was doomed to defeat.  And so\r\nit transpired.  The vote stood 93 yeas, to 65 nays--Mr. Ashley having\r\nchanged his vote, from the affirmative to the negative, for the purpose\r\nof submitting, at the proper time, a motion to reconsider.\r\n\r\nThat same evening, Mr. Ashley made the motion to reconsider the vote by\r\nwhich the proposed Constitutional Amendment was rejected; and the motion\r\nwas duly entered in the Journal, despite the persistent efforts of\r\nMessrs.  Cox, Holman, and others, to prevent it.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of June, just prior to the Congressional Recess, Mr. Ashley\r\nannounced that he had been disappointed in the hope of securing enough\r\nvotes from the Democratic side of the House to carry the Amendment.\r\n\"Those,\" said he, \"who ought to have been the champions of this great\r\nproposition are unfortunately its strongest opponents.  They have\r\npermitted the golden opportunity to pass.  The record is made up, and we\r\nmust go to the Country on this issue thus presented.\"  And then he gave\r\nnotice that he would call the matter up, at the earliest possible moment\r\nafter the opening of the December Session of Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n                      SLAVERY DOOMED AT THE POLLS.\r\n\r\nThe record was indeed made up, and the issue thus made, between Slavery\r\nand Freedom, would be the chief one before the People.  Already the\r\nRepublican National Convention, which met at Baltimore, June 7, 1864,\r\nhad not only with \"enthusiastic unanimity,\" renominated Mr. Lincoln for\r\nthe Presidency, but amid \"tremendous applause,\" the delegates rising and\r\nwaving their hats--had adopted a platform which declared, in behalf of\r\nthat great Party: \"That, as Slavery was the cause, and now constitutes\r\nthe strength, of this Rebellion, and as it must be, always and\r\neverywhere, hostile to the principles of Republican government, Justice\r\nand the National safety demand its utter and complete extirpation from\r\nthe soil of the Republic; and that while we uphold and maintain the Acts\r\nand Proclamations by which the Government, in its own defense, has aimed\r\na death-blow at this gigantic evil, we are in favor, furthermore, of\r\nsuch an Amendment to the Constitution, to be made by the People in\r\nconformity with its provisions, as shall terminate and forever prohibit\r\nthe existence of Slavery within the limits or the jurisdiction of the\r\nUnited States.\"\r\n\r\nSo, too, with vociferous plaudits, had they received and adopted another\r\nResolution, wherein they declared \"That we approve and applaud the\r\npractical wisdom, the unselfish patriotism and the unswerving fidelity\r\nto the Constitution and the principles of American Liberty, with which\r\nAbraham Lincoln has discharged, under circumstances of unparalleled\r\ndifficulty, the great duties and responsibilities of the Presidential\r\nOffice; that we approve and endorse, as demanded by the emergency, and\r\nessential to the preservation of the Nation, and as within the\r\nprovisions of the Constitution; the Measures and Acts which he has\r\nadopted to defend the Nation against its open and secret foes; that we\r\napprove, especially, the Proclamation of Emancipation, and the\r\nemployment, as Union soldiers, of men heretofore held in Slavery; and\r\nthat we have full confidence in his determination to carry these and all\r\nother Constitutional Measures essential to the salvation of the Country,\r\ninto full and complete effect.\"\r\n\r\nThus heartily, thoroughly and unreservedly, endorsed in all the great\r\nacts of his Administration--and even more emphatically, if possible, in\r\nhis Emancipation policy--by the unanimous vote of his Party, Mr.\r\nLincoln, although necessarily \"chagrined and disappointed\" by the\r\nHouse-vote which had defeated the Thirteenth Amendment, might well feel\r\nundismayed.  He always had implicit faith in the People; he felt sure\r\nthat they would sustain him; and this done, why could not the votes of a\r\ndozen, out of the seventy Congressional Representatives opposing that\r\nAmendment, be changed?  Even failing in this, it must be but a question\r\nof time.  He thought he could afford to bide that time.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of August, the Democratic National Convention met at\r\nChicago.  Horatio Seymour was its permanent President; that same\r\nGovernor of New York whom the 4th of July, 1863, almost at the moment\r\nwhen Vicksburg and Gettysburg had brought great encouragement to the\r\nUnion cause, and when public necessity demanded the enforcement of the\r\nDraft in order to drive the Rebel invader from Northern soil and bring\r\nthe Rebellion speedily to an end--had threateningly said to the\r\nRepublicans, in the course of a public speech, during the Draft-riots at\r\nNew York City: \"Remember this, that the bloody, and treasonable, and\r\nrevolutionary doctrine of public necessity can be proclaimed by a mob as\r\nwell as by a Government.  * * * When men accept despotism, they may have\r\na choice as to who the despot shall be!\"\r\n\r\nIn his speech to this Democratic-Copperhead National Convention,\r\ntherefore, it is not surprising that he should, at this time, declare\r\nthat \"this Administration cannot now save this Union, if it would.\"\r\nThat the body which elected such a presiding officer,--after the bloody\r\nseries of glorious Union victories about Atlanta, Ga., then fast leading\r\nup to the fall of that great Rebel stronghold, (which event actually\r\noccurred long before most of these Democratic delegates, on their\r\nreturn, could even reach their homes)--should adopt a Resolution\r\ndeclaring that the War was a \"failure,\" was not surprising either.\r\n\r\nThat Resolution--\"the material resolution of the Chicago platform,\" as\r\nVallandigham afterward characters it, was written and \"carried through\r\nboth the Subcommittee and the General Committee\" by that Arch-Copperhead\r\nand Conspirator himself.--[See his letter of October 22, 1864, to the\r\neditor of the New York News,]\r\n\r\nIt was in these words: \"Resolved, That this Convention does explicitly\r\ndeclare as the sense of the American People, that after four years of\r\nfailure to restore the Union by the experiment of War, during which,\r\nunder the pretense of a military necessity, or War-power higher than the\r\nConstitution, the Constitution itself has been disregarded in every\r\npart, and public Liberty and private right alike trodden down and the\r\nmaterial prosperity of the Country essentially impaired--Justice,\r\nHumanity, Liberty, and the public welfare demand that immediate efforts\r\nbe made for a cessation of hostilities, with a view to an ultimate\r\nConvention of the States, or other peaceable means, to the end that at\r\nthe earliest practicable moment Peace may be restored on the basis of\r\nthe Federal Union of the States.\"\r\n\r\nWith a Copperhead platform, this Democratic Convention thought it\r\npolitic to have a Union candidate for the Presidency.  Hence, the\r\nnomination of General McClellan; but to propitiate the out-and-out\r\nVallandigham Peace men, Mr. Pendleton was nominated to the second place\r\non the ticket.\r\n\r\nThis combination was almost as great a blunder as was the platform--than\r\nwhich nothing could have been worse.  Farragut's Naval victory at\r\nMobile, and Sherman's capture of Atlanta, followed so closely upon the\r\nadjournment of the Convention as to make its platform and candidates the\r\nlaughing stock of the Nation; and all the efforts of Democratic orators,\r\nand of McClellan himself, in his letter of acceptance, could not prevent\r\nthe rise of that great tidal-wave of Unionism which was soon to engulf\r\nthe hosts of Copperhead-Democracy.\r\n\r\nThe Thanksgiving-services in the churches, and the thundering salutes of\r\n100 guns from every Military and Naval post in the United States, which\r\n--during the week succeeding that Convention's sitting--betokened the\r\nNation's especial joy and gratitude to the victorious Union Forces of\r\nSherman and Farragut for their fortuitously-timed demonstration that the\r\n\"experiment of War\" for the restoration of the Union was anything but a\r\n\"Failure\" all helped to add to the proportions of that rapidly-swelling\r\nvolume of loyal public feeling.\r\n\r\nThe withdrawal from the canvass, of General Fremont, nominated for the\r\nPresidency by the \"radical men of the Nation,\" at Cleveland, also\r\ncontributed to it.  In his letter of withdrawal, September 17th, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"The Presidential contest has, in effect, been entered upon in such a\r\nway that the union of the Republican Party has become a paramount\r\nnecessity.  The policy of the Democratic Party signifies either\r\nseparation, or reestablishment with Slavery.  The Chicago platform is\r\nsimply separation.  General McClellan's letter of acceptance is\r\nreestablishment, with Slavery.  The Republican candidate is, on the\r\ncontrary, pledged to the reestablishment of the Union without Slavery;\r\nand, however hesitating his policy may be, the pressure of his Party\r\nwill, we may hope, force him to it.  Between these issues, I think no\r\nman of the Liberal Party can remain in doubt.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now, following the fall of Atlanta before Sherman's Forces, Grant\r\nhad stormed \"Fort Hell,\" in front of Petersburg; Sheridan had routed the\r\nRebels, under Early, at Winchester, and had again defeated Early at\r\nFisher's Hill; Lee had been repulsed in his attack on Grant's works at\r\nPetersburg; and Allatoona had been made famous, by Corse and his 2,000\r\nUnion men gallantly repulsing the 5,000 men of Hood's Rebel Army, who\r\nhad completely surrounded and attacked them in front, flank, and rear.\r\n\r\nAll these Military successes for the Union Cause helped the Union\r\npolitical campaign considerably, and, when supplemented by the\r\nremarkable results of the October elections in Pennsylvania, Indiana,\r\nand Maryland, made the election of Lincoln and Johnson a foregone\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nThe sudden death of Chief-Justice Taney, too, happening, by a strange\r\ncoincidence, simultaneously with the triumph of the Union Party of\r\nMaryland in carrying the new Constitution of that State, which\r\nprohibited Slavery within her borders, seemed to have a significance*\r\nnot without its effect upon the public mind, now fast settling down to\r\nthe belief that Slavery everywhere upon the soil of the United States\r\nmust die.\r\n\r\n     [Greeley well said of it: \"His death, at this moment, seemed to\r\n     mark the transition from the Era of Slavery to that of Universal\r\n     Freedom.\"]\r\n\r\nThen came, October 19th, the Battle of Cedar Creek, Va. where the Rebel\r\nGeneral Early, during Sheridan's absence, surprised and defeated the\r\nlatter's forces, until Sheridan, riding down from Winchester, turned\r\ndefeat into victory for the Union Arms, and chased the armed Rebels out\r\nof the Shenandoah Valley forever; and the fights of October 27th and\r\n28th, to the left of Grant's position, at Petersburg, by which the\r\nrailroad communications of Lee's Army at Richmond were broken up.\r\n\r\nAt last, November 8, 1864, dawned the eventful day of election.  By\r\nmidnight of that date it was generally believed, all over the Union,\r\nthat Lincoln and Johnson were overwhelmingly elected, and that the Life\r\nas well as Freedom of the Nation had thus been saved by the People.\r\n\r\nLate that very night, President Lincoln was serenaded by a Pennsylvania\r\npolitical club, and, in responding to the compliment, modestly said:\r\n\r\n\"I earnestly believe that the consequences of this day's work (if it be\r\nas you assure, and as now seems probable) will be to the lasting\r\nadvantage, if not to the very salvation, of the Country.  I cannot at\r\nthis hour say what has been the result of the election.  But whatever it\r\nmay be, I have no desire to modify this opinion, that all who have\r\nlabored to-day in behalf of the Union organization have wrought for the\r\nbest interests of their Country and the World, not only for the present\r\nbut for all future ages.\r\n\r\n\"I am thankful to God,\" continued he, \"for this approval of the People;\r\nbut, while deeply gratified for this mark of their confidence in me, if\r\nI know my heart, my gratitude is free from any taint of personal\r\ntriumph.  I do not impugn the motives of any one opposed to me.  It is\r\nno pleasure to me to triumph over any one; but I give thanks to the\r\nAlmighty for this evidence of the People's resolution to stand by Free\r\nGovernment and the rights of Humanity.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of November, in response to another serenade given at the\r\nWhite House, in the presence of an immense and jubilantly enthusiastic\r\ngathering of Union men, by the Republican clubs of the District of\r\nColumbia, Mr. Lincoln said:\r\n\r\n\"It has long been a grave question whether any Government, not too\r\nstrong for the Liberties of its People, can be strong enough to maintain\r\nits existence in great emergencies.  On this point the present\r\nRebellion.  has brought our Republic to a severe test, and a\r\nPresidential election, occurring in regular course during the Rebellion,\r\nhas added not a little to the strain.  * * *  But the election, along\r\nwith its incidental and undesired strife, has done good, too.  It has\r\ndemonstrated that a People's Government can sustain a National election\r\nin the midst of a great Civil War, until now it has not been known to\r\nthe World that this was a possibility.  It shows, also, how sound and\r\nhow strong we still are.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said he, \"the Rebellion continues; and now that the election is\r\nover, may not all having a common interest reunite in a common effort to\r\nsave our common Country?\r\n\r\n\"For my own part,\" continued he--as the cheering, elicited by this\r\nforcible appeal, ceased--\"I have striven, and shall strive, to avoid\r\nplacing any obstacle in the way.  So long as I have been here I have not\r\nwillingly planted a thorn in any man's bosom.  While I am deeply\r\nsensible to the high compliment of a reelection, and duly grateful, as I\r\ntrust, to Almighty God for having directed my countrymen to a right\r\nconclusion, as I think, for their own good, it adds nothing to my\r\nsatisfaction that any other man may be disappointed or pained by the\r\nresult.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, as the renewed cheering evoked by this kindly, Christian utterance\r\ndied away again, he impressively added: \"May I ask those who have not\r\ndiffered with me, to join with me in this same spirit, towards those who\r\nhave?\"\r\n\r\nSo, too, on the 17th of November, in his response to the complimentary\r\naddress of a delegation of Union men from Maryland.\r\n\r\n     [W. H. Purnell, Esq., in behalf of the Committee, delivered an\r\n     address, in which he said they rejoiced that the People, by such an\r\n     overwhelming and unprecedented majority, had again reelected Mr.\r\n     Lincoln to the Presidency and endorsed his course--elevating him to\r\n     the proudest and most honorable position on Earth.  They felt under\r\n     deep obligation to him because he had appreciated their condition\r\n     as a Slave-State.  It was not too much to say that by the exercise\r\n     of rare discretion on his part, Maryland to-day occupies her\r\n     position in favor of Freedom.  Slavery has been abolished therefrom\r\n     by the Sovereign Decree of the People.  With deep and lasting\r\n     gratitude they desired that his Administration, as it had been\r\n     approved in the past, might also be successful in the future, and\r\n     result in the Restoration of the Union, with Freedom as its\r\n     immutable basis.  They trusted that, on retiring from his high and\r\n     honorable position, the universal verdict might be that he deserved\r\n     well of mankind, and that favoring Heaven might 'Crown his days\r\n     with loving kindness and tender mercies.']\r\n\r\nThe same kindly anxiety to soften and dispel the feeling of\r\nbitterness that had been engendered in the malignant bosoms of the\r\nCopperhead-Democracy by their defeat, was apparent when he said with\r\nemphasis and feeling:\r\n\r\n\"I have said before, and now repeat, that I indulge in no feeling of\r\ntriumph over any man who has thought or acted differently from myself.\r\nI have no such feeling toward any living man;\" and again, after\r\ncomplimenting Maryland for doing \"more than double her share\" in the\r\nelections, in that she had not only carried the Republican ticket, but\r\nalso the Free Constitution, he added: \"Those who have differed with us\r\nand opposed us will yet see that the result of the Presidential election\r\nis better for their own good than if they had been successful.\"\r\n\r\nThe victory of the Union-Republican Party at this election was an\r\namazing one, and in the words of General Grant's dispatch of\r\ncongratulation to the President, the fact of its \"having passed off\r\nquietly\" was, in itself, \"a victory worth more to the Country than a\r\nbattle won,\"--for the Copperheads had left no stone unturned in their\r\nefforts to create the utmost possible rancor, in the minds of their\r\npartisans, against the Administration and its Party.\r\n\r\nOf twenty-five States voting, Lincoln and Johnson had carried the\r\nelectoral votes of twenty-two of them, viz.: Maine, New Hampshire,\r\nMassachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Vermont, New York,\r\nPennsylvania, Maryland, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Michigan,\r\nIowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota, California, Oregon, Kansas, West Virginia,\r\nand Nevada; while McClellan and Pendleton had carried the twenty-one\r\nelectoral votes of the remaining three, viz.: New Jersey, Delaware, and\r\nKentucky--the popular vote reaching the enormous number of 2,216,067 for\r\nLincoln, to 1,808,725 for McClellan--making Lincoln's popular majority\r\n407,342, and his electoral majority 191!\r\n\r\nBut if the figures upon the Presidential candidacy were so gratifying\r\nand surprising to all who held the cause of Union above all others, no\r\nless gratifying and surprising were those of the Congressional\r\nelections, which indicated an entire revulsion of popular feeling on the\r\nsubject of the Administration's policy.  For, while in the current\r\nCongress (the 38th), there were only 106 Republican-Union to 77\r\nDemocratic Representatives, in that for which the elections had just\r\nbeen held, (the 39th), there would be 143 Republican-Union to 41\r\nDemocratic Representatives.\r\n\r\nIt was at once seen, therefore, that, should the existing House of\r\nRepresentatives fail to adopt the Thirteenth Amendment to the\r\nConstitution, there would be much more than the requisite two-thirds\r\nmajority for such a Measure in both Houses of the succeeding Congress;\r\nand moreover that in the event of its failure at the coming Session, it\r\nwas more than probable that President Lincoln would consider himself\r\njustified in calling an Extra Session of the Thirty-ninth Congress for\r\nthe especial purpose of taking such action.  So far then, as the\r\nprospects of the Thirteenth Amendment were concerned, they looked\r\ndecidedly more encouraging.",
