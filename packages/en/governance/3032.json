It was in the Declaration of\r\nIndependence that this name was first and formally proclaimed to the\r\nworld, and to maintain its verity the war of the Revolution was fought.\r\nAmericans like to think that they were then assuming \"among the Powers\r\nof the Earth the equal and independent Station to which the Laws\r\nof Nature and of Nature's God entitle them\"; and, in view of their\r\nsubsequent marvelous development, they are inclined to add that it must\r\nhave been before an expectant world.\r\n\r\nIn these days of prosperity and national greatness it is hard to realize\r\nthat the achievement of independence did not place the United States on\r\na footing of equality with other countries and that, in fact, the new\r\nstate was more or less an unwelcome member of the world family. It is\r\nnevertheless true that the latest comer into the family of nations\r\ndid not for a long time command the respect of the world. This lack\r\nof respect was partly due to the character of the American population.\r\nAlong with the many estimable and excellent people who had come to\r\nBritish North America inspired by the best of motives, there had come\r\nothers who were not regarded favorably by the governing classes of\r\nEurope. Discontent is frequently a healthful sign and a forerunner of\r\nprogress, but it makes one an uncomfortable neighbor in a satisfied and\r\nconservative community; and discontent was the underlying factor in\r\nthe migration from the Old World to the New. In any composite immigrant\r\npopulation such as that of the United States there was bound to be a\r\nlarge element of undesirables. Among those who came \"for conscience's\r\nsake\" were the best type of religious protestants, but there were also\r\nreligious cranks from many countries, of almost every conceivable sect\r\nand of no sect at all. Many of the newcomers were poor. It was common,\r\ntoo, to regard colonies as inferior places of residence to which\r\nobjectionable persons might be encouraged to go and where the average\r\nof the population was lowered by the influx of convicts and thousands of\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\n\"The great number of emigrants from Europe\"--wrote Thieriot, Saxon\r\nCommissioner of Commerce to America, from Philadelphia in 1784--\"has\r\nfilled this place with worthless persons to such a degree that scarcely\r\na day passes without theft, robbery, or even assassination.\" ¹ It would\r\nperhaps be too much to say that the people of the United States were\r\nlooked upon by the rest of the world as only half civilized, but\r\ncertainly they were regarded as of lower social standing and of inferior\r\nquality, and many of them were known to be rough, uncultured, and\r\nignorant. Great Britain and Germany maintained American missionary\r\nsocieties, not, as might perhaps be expected, for the benefit of the\r\nIndian or negro, but for the poor, benighted colonists themselves; and\r\nGreat Britain refused to commission a minister to her former colonies\r\nfor nearly ten years after their independence had been recognized.\r\n\r\n¹ Quoted by W. E. Lingelbach, History Teacher's Magazine, March, 1913.\r\n\r\nIt is usually thought that the dregs of humiliation have been reached\r\nwhen the rights of foreigners are not considered safe in a particular\r\ncountry, so that another state insists upon establishing therein its own\r\ntribunal for the trial of its citizens or subjects. Yet that is what the\r\nFrench insisted upon in the United States, and they were supposed to be\r\nespecially friendly. They had had their own experience in America.\r\nFirst the native Indian had appealed to their imagination. Then, at\r\nan appropriate moment, they seemed to see in the Americans a living\r\nembodiment of the philosophical theories of the time: they thought that\r\nthey had at last found \"the natural man\" of Rousseau and Voltaire;\r\nthey believed that they saw the social contract theory being worked\r\nout before their very eyes. Nevertheless, in spite of this interest in\r\nAmericans, the French looked upon them as an inferior people over whom\r\nthey would have liked to exercise a sort of protectorate. To them the\r\nAmericans seemed to lack a proper knowledge of the amenities of life.\r\nCommissioner Thieriot, describing the administration of justice in the\r\nnew republic, noticed that: \"A Frenchman, with the prejudices of his\r\ncountry and accustomed to court sessions in which the officers have\r\nimposing robes and a uniform that makes it impossible to recognize\r\nthem, smiles at seeing in the court room men dressed in street clothes,\r\nsimple, often quite common. He is astonished to see the public enter and\r\nleave the court room freely, those who prefer even keeping their hats\r\non.\" Later he adds: \"It appears that the court of France wished to set\r\nup a jurisdiction of its own on this continent for all matters involving\r\nFrench subjects.\" France failed in this; but at the very time that\r\npeace was under discussion Congress authorized Franklin to negotiate a\r\nconsular convention, ratified a few years later, according to which the\r\ncitizens of the United States and the subjects of the French King in\r\nthe country of the other should be tried by their respective consuls or\r\nvice-consuls. Though this agreement was made reciprocal in its terms and\r\nso saved appearances for the honor of the new nation, nevertheless\r\nin submitting it to Congress John Jay clearly pointed out that it was\r\nreciprocal in name rather than in substance, as there were few or no\r\nAmericans in France but an increasing number of Frenchmen in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nSuch was the status of the new republic in the family of nations when\r\nthe time approached for the negotiation of a treaty of peace with the\r\nmother country. The war really ended with the surrender of Cornwallis\r\nat Yorktown in 1781. Yet even then the British were unwilling to concede\r\nthe independence of the revolted colonies. This refusal of recognition\r\nwas not merely a matter of pride; a division and a consequent weakening\r\nof the empire was involved; to avoid this Great Britain seems to have\r\nbeen willing to make any other concessions that were necessary. The\r\nmother country sought to avoid disruption at all costs. But the time had\r\npassed when any such adjustment might have been possible. The Americans\r\nnow flatly refused to treat of peace upon any footing except that of\r\nindependent equality. The British, being in no position to continue the\r\nstruggle, were obliged to yield and to declare in the first article of\r\nthe treaty of peace that \"His Britannic Majesty acknowledges the said\r\nUnited States ... to be free, sovereign, and independent states.\"\r\n\r\nWith France the relationship of the United States was clear and friendly\r\nenough at the time. The American War of Independence had been brought\r\nto a successful issue with the aid of France. In the treaty of alliance\r\nwhich had been signed in 1778 had been agreed that neither France nor\r\nthe United States should, without the consent of the other, make peace\r\nwith Great Britain. More than that, in 1781, partly out of gratitude but\r\nlargely as a result of clever manipulation of factions in Congress by\r\nthe French Minister in Philadelphia, the Chevalier de la Luzerne, the\r\nAmerican peace commissioners had been instructed \"to make the most\r\ncandid and confidential communications upon all subjects to the\r\nministers of our generous ally, the King of France; to undertake nothing\r\nin the negotiations for peace or truce without their knowledge and\r\nconcurrence; and ultimately to govern yourselves by their advice and\r\nopinion.\" ¹ If France had been actuated only by unselfish motives in\r\nsupporting the colonies in their revolt against Great Britain, these\r\ninstructions might have been acceptable and even advisable. But such was\r\nnot the case. France was working not so much with philanthropic purposes\r\nor for sentimental reasons as for the restoration to her former position\r\nof supremacy in Europe. Revenge upon England was only a part of a larger\r\nplan of national aggrandizement.\r\n\r\n¹ \"Secret Journals of Congress,\" June 15, 1781.\r\n\r\nThe treaty with France in 1778 had declared that war should be continued\r\nuntil the independence of the United States had been established, and it\r\nappeared as if that were the main purpose of the alliance. For her\r\nown good reasons France had dragged Spain into the struggle. Spain,\r\nof course, fought to cripple Great Britain and not to help the United\r\nStates. In return for this support France was pledged to assist Spain\r\nin obtaining certain additions to her territory. In so far as these\r\nadditions related to North America, the interests of Spain and those\r\nof the United States were far from being identical; in fact, they were\r\nfrequently in direct opposition. Spain was already in possession of\r\nLouisiana and, by prompt action on her entry into the war in 1780, she\r\nhad succeeded in getting control of eastern Louisiana and of practically\r\nall the Floridas except St. Augustine. To consolidate these holdings\r\nand round out her American empire, Spain would have liked to obtain\r\nthe title to all the land between the Alleghany Mountains and the\r\nMississippi. Failing this, however, she seemed to prefer that the region\r\nnorthwest of the Ohio River should belong to the British rather than to\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances it was fortunate for the United States that\r\nthe American Peace Commissioners were broad-minded enough to appreciate\r\nthe situation and to act on their own responsibility. Benjamin Franklin,\r\nalthough he was not the first to be appointed, was generally considered\r\nto be the chief of the Commission by reason of his age, experience, and\r\nreputation. Over seventy-five years old, he was more universally\r\nknown and admired than probably any man of his time. This many-sided\r\nAmerican--printer, almanac maker, writer, scientist, and philosopher--by\r\nthe variety of his abilities as well as by the charm of his manner\r\nseemed to have found his real mission in the diplomatic field, where he\r\ncould serve his country and at the same time, with credit to himself,\r\npreach his own doctrines.\r\n\r\nWhen Franklin was sent to Europe at the outbreak of the Revolution,\r\nit was as if destiny had intended him for that particular task. His\r\nachievements had already attracted attention; in his fur cap and\r\neccentric dress \"he fulfilled admirably the Parisian ideal of the forest\r\nphilosopher\"; and with his facility in conversation, as well as by the\r\nattractiveness of his personality, he won both young and old. But, with\r\nhis undoubted zeal for liberty and his unquestioned love of country,\r\nFranklin never departed from the Quaker principles he affected and\r\nalways tried to avoid a fight. In these efforts, owing to his shrewdness\r\nand his willingness to compromise, he was generally successful.\r\n\r\nJohn Adams, being then the American representative at The Hague, was the\r\nfirst Commissioner to be appointed. Indeed, when he was first named, in\r\n1779, he was to be sole commissioner to negotiate peace; and it was the\r\ninfluential French Minister to the United States who was responsible for\r\nothers being added to the commission. Adams was a sturdy New Englander\r\nof British stock and of a distinctly English type--medium height, a\r\nstout figure, and a ruddy face. No one questioned his honesty, his\r\nstraightforwardness, or his lack of tact. Being a man of strong mind,\r\nof wide reading and even great learning, and having serene confidence in\r\nthe purity of his motives as well as in the soundness of his judgment,\r\nAdams was little inclined to surrender his own views, and was ready\r\nto carry out his ideas against every obstacle. By nature as well as by\r\ntraining he seems to have been incapable of understanding the French; he\r\nwas suspicious of them and he disapproved of Franklin's popularity even\r\nas he did of his personality.\r\n\r\nFive Commissioners in all were named, but Thomas Jefferson and Henry\r\nLaurens did not take part in the negotiations, so that the only other\r\nactive member was John Jay, then thirty-seven years old and already a\r\nman of prominence in his own country. Of French Huguenot stock and type,\r\nhe was tall and slender, with somewhat of a scholar's stoop, and was\r\nusually dressed in black. His manners were gentle and unassuming, but\r\nhis face, with its penetrating black eyes, its aquiline nose and pointed\r\nchin, revealed a proud and sensitive disposition. He had been sent to\r\nthe court of Spain in 1780, and there he had learned enough to arouse\r\nhis suspicious, if nothing more, of Spain's designs as well as of the\r\nFrench intention to support them.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1782 Adams felt obliged to remain at The Hague in order\r\nto complete the negotiations already successfully begun for a commercial\r\ntreaty with the Netherlands. Franklin, thus the only Commissioner on the\r\nground in Paris, began informal negotiations alone but sent an urgent\r\ncall to Jay in Spain, who was convinced of the fruitlessness of his\r\nmission there and promptly responded. Jay's experience in Spain and his\r\nknowledge of Spanish hopes had led him to believe that the French were\r\nnot especially concerned about American interests but were in fact\r\nwilling to sacrifice them if necessary to placate Spain. He accordingly\r\ninsisted that the American Commissioners should disregard their\r\ninstructions and, without the knowledge of France, should deal directly\r\nwith Great Britain. In this contention he was supported by Adams when\r\nhe arrived, but it was hard to persuade Franklin to accept this point\r\nof view, for he was unwilling to believe anything so unworthy of his\r\nadmiring and admired French. Nevertheless, with his cautious shrewdness,\r\nhe finally yielded so far as to agree to see what might come out of\r\ndirect negotiations.\r\n\r\nThe rest was relatively easy. Of course there were difficulties and such\r\nsharp differences of opinion that, even after long negotiation, some\r\nmatters had to be compromised. Some problems, too, were found insoluble\r\nand were finally left without a settlement. But such difficulties as\r\ndid exist were slight in comparison with the previous hopelessness of\r\nreconciling American and Spanish ambitions, especially when the latter\r\nwere supported by France. On the one hand, the Americans were the\r\nprotégés of the French and were expected to give way before the claims\r\nof their patron's friends to an extent which threatened to limit\r\nseriously their growth and development. On the other hand, they were\r\nthe younger sons of England, uncivilized by their wilderness life,\r\nungrateful and rebellious, but still to be treated by England as\r\nchildren of the blood. In the all-important question of extent of\r\nterritory, where Spain and France would have limited the United States\r\nto the east of the Alleghany Mountains, Great Britain was persuaded\r\nwithout great difficulty, having once conceded independence to the\r\nUnited States, to yield the boundaries which she herself had formerly\r\nclaimed--from the Atlantic Ocean on the east to the Mississippi River\r\non the west, and from Canada on the north to the southern boundary\r\nof Georgia. Unfortunately the northern line, through ignorance and\r\ncarelessness rather than through malice, was left uncertain at various\r\npoints and became the subject of almost continuous controversy until the\r\nlast bit of it was settled in 1911. ¹\r\n\r\n¹ See Lord Bryce's Introduction (p. xxiv) to W. A. Dunning, The British\r\nEmpire and the United States (1914).\r\n\r\nThe fisheries of the North Atlantic, for which Newfoundland served as\r\nthe chief entrepôt, had been one of the great assets of North America\r\nfrom the time of its discovery. They had been one of the chief prizes\r\nat stake in the struggle between the French and the British for the\r\npossession of the continent, and they had been of so much value that\r\na British statute of 1775 which cut off the New England fisheries was\r\nregarded, even after the \"intolerable acts\" of the previous year, as the\r\nheight of punishment for New England. Many Englishmen would have been\r\nglad to see the Americans excluded from these fisheries, but John Adams,\r\nwhen he arrived from The Hague, displayed an appreciation of New England\r\ninterests and the quality of his temper as well by flatly refusing to\r\nagree to any treaty which did not allow full fishing privileges. The\r\nBritish accordingly yielded and the Americans were granted fishing\r\nrights as \"heretofore\" enjoyed. The right of navigation of the\r\nMississippi River, it was declared in the treaty, should \"forever\r\nremain free and open\" to both parties; but here Great Britain was simply\r\npassing on to the United States a formal right which she had received\r\nfrom France and was retaining for herself a similar right which might\r\nsometime prove of use, for as long as Spain held both banks at the mouth\r\nof the Mississippi River, the right was of little practical value.\r\n\r\nTwo subjects involving the greatest difficulty of arrangement were\r\nthe compensation of the Loyalists and the settlement of commercial\r\nindebtedness. The latter was really a question of the payment of British\r\ncreditors by American debtors, for there was little on the other side\r\nof the balance sheet, and it seems as if the frugal Franklin would have\r\npreferred to make no concessions and would have allowed creditors to\r\ntake their own chances of getting paid. But the matter appeared to\r\nAdams in a different light--perhaps his New England conscience was\r\naroused--and in this point of view he was supported by Jay. It was\r\ntherefore finally agreed \"that creditors on either side shall meet\r\nwith no lawful impediment to the recovery of the full value in sterling\r\nmoney, of all bona fide debts heretofore contracted.\" However just this\r\nprovision may have been, its incorporation in the terms of the treaty\r\nwas a mistake on the part of the Commissioners, because the Government\r\nof the United States had no power to give effect to such an arrangement,\r\nso that the provision had no more value than an emphatic expression of\r\nopinion. Accordingly, when some of the States later disregarded this\r\npart of the treaty, the British had an excuse for refusing to carry out\r\ncertain of their own obligations.\r\n\r\nThe historian of the Virginia Federal Convention of 1788, H. B. Grigsby,\r\nrelates an amusing incident growing out of the controversy over the\r\npayment of debts to creditors in England:\r\n\r\nA Scotchman, John Warden, a prominent lawyer and good classical scholar,\r\nbut suspected rightly of Tory leanings during the Revolution, learning\r\nof the large minority against the repeal of laws in conflict with the\r\ntreaty of 1783 (i. e., especially the laws as to the collection of debts\r\nby foreigners) caustically remarked that some of the members of the\r\nHouse had voted against paying for the coats on their backs. The story\r\ngoes that he was summoned before the House in full session, and was\r\ncompelled to beg their pardon on his knees; but as he rose, pretending\r\nto brush the dust from his knees, he pointed to the House and said\r\naudibly, with evident double meaning, 'Upon my word, a dommed dirty\r\nhouse it is indeed.' The Journal of the House, however, shows that the\r\nhonor of the delegates was satisfied by a written assurance from Mr.\r\nWarden that he meant in no way to affront the dignity of the House or to\r\ninsult any of its members.\r\n\r\nThe other question, that of compensating the Loyalists for the loss of\r\ntheir property, was not so simple a matter, for the whole story of the\r\nRevolution was involved. There is a tendency among many scholars of\r\nthe present day to regard the policy of the British toward their\r\nNorth American colonies as possibly unwise and blundering but as being\r\nentirely in accordance with the legal and constitutional rights of the\r\nmother country, and to believe that the Americans, while they may have\r\nbeen practically and therefore morally justified in asserting their\r\nindependence, were still technically and legally in the wrong. It is\r\nimmaterial whether or not that point of view is accepted, for its mere\r\nrecognition is sufficient to explain the existence of a large number of\r\nAmericans who were steadfast in their support of the British side of the\r\ncontroversy. Indeed, it has been estimated that as large a proportion\r\nas one-third of the population remained loyal to the Crown. Numbers must\r\nremain more or less uncertain, but probably the majority of the people\r\nin the United States, whatever their feelings may have been, tried to\r\nremain neutral or at least to appear so; and it is undoubtedly true\r\nthat the Revolution was accomplished by an aggressive minority and that\r\nperhaps as great a number were actively loyal to Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThese Loyalists comprised at least two groups. One of these was a\r\nwealthy, property-owning class, representing the best social element in\r\nthe colonies, extremely conservative, believing in privilege and\r\nfearing the rise of democracy. The other was composed of the royal\r\noffice-holders, which included some of the better families, but was more\r\nlargely made up of the lower class of political and social hangers-on,\r\nwho had been rewarded with these positions for political debts incurred\r\nin England. The opposition of both groups to the Revolution was\r\ninevitable and easily to be understood, but it was also natural that\r\nthe Revolutionists should incline to hold the Loyalists, without\r\ndistinction, largely responsible for British pre-Revolutionary policy,\r\nasserting that they misinformed the Government as to conditions and\r\nsentiment in America, partly through stupidity and partly through\r\nselfish interest. It was therefore perfectly comprehensible that the\r\nfeeling should be bitter against them in the United States, especially\r\nas they had given efficient aid to the British during the war. In\r\nvarious States they were subjected to personal violence at the hands of\r\nindignant \"patriots,\" many being forced to flee from their homes, while\r\ntheir property was destroyed or confiscated, and frequently these acts\r\nwere legalized by statute.\r\n\r\nThe historian of the Loyalists of Massachusetts, James H. Stark, must\r\nnot be expected to understate the case, but when he is describing,\r\nespecially in New England, the reign of terror which was established to\r\nsuppress these people, he writes:\r\n\r\nLoyalists were tarred and feathered and carried on rails, gagged and\r\nbound for days at a time; stoned, fastened in a room with a fire and the\r\nchimney stopped on top; advertised as public enemies, so that they would\r\nbe cut off from all dealings with their neighbors; they had bullets\r\nshot into their bedrooms, their horses poisoned or mutilated; money or\r\nvaluable plate extorted from them to save them from violence, and on\r\npretence of taking security for their good behavior; their houses and\r\nships burned; they were compelled to pay the guards who watched them in\r\ntheir houses, and when carted about for the mob to stare at and abuse,\r\nthey were compelled to pay something at every town.\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt also that the confiscation of property and the\r\nexpulsion of the owners from the community were helped on by people who\r\nwere debtors to the Loyalists and in this way saw a chance of\r\nescaping from the payment of their rightful obligations. The \"Act for\r\nconfiscating the estates of certain persons commonly called absentees\"\r\nmay have been a measure of self-defense for the State but it was passed\r\nby the votes of those who undoubtedly profited by its provisions.\r\n\r\nThose who had stood loyally by the Crown must in turn be looked out for\r\nby the British Government, especially when the claims of justice were\r\nreinforced by the important consideration that many of those with\r\nproperty and financial interests in America were relatives of\r\ninfluential persons in England. The immediate necessity during the war\r\nhad been partially met by assisting thousands to go to Canada--where\r\ntheir descendants today form an important element in the population and\r\nare proud of being United Empire Loyalists--while pensions and gifts\r\nwere supplied to others. Now that the war was over the British were\r\ndetermined that Americans should make good to the Loyalists for all that\r\nthey had suffered, and His Majesty's Commissioners were hopeful at least\r\nof obtaining a proviso similar to the one relating to the collection of\r\ndebts. John Adams, however, expressed the prevailing American idea\r\nwhen he said that \"paying debts and compensating Tories\" were two very\r\ndifferent things, and Jay asserted that there were certain of these\r\nrefugees whom Americans never would forgive.\r\n\r\nBut this was the one thing needed to complete the negotiations for\r\npeace, and the British arguments on the injustice and irregularity of\r\nthe treatment accorded to the Loyalists were so strong that the American\r\nCommissioners were finally driven to the excuse that the Government of\r\nthe Confederation had no power over the individual States by whom\r\nthe necessary action must be taken. Finally, in a spirit of mutual\r\nconcession at the end of the negotiations, the Americans agreed that\r\nCongress should \"recommend to the legislatures of the respective states\r\nto provide for the restitution\" of properties which had been confiscated\r\n\"belonging to real British subjects,\" and \"that persons of any other\r\ndescription\" might return to the United States for a period of\r\ntwelve months and be \"unmolested in their endeavours to obtain the\r\nrestitution.\"\r\n\r\nWith this show of yielding on the part of the American Commissioners it\r\nwas possible to conclude the terms of peace, and the preliminary treaty\r\nwas drawn accordingly and agreed to on November 30, 1782. Franklin had\r\nbeen of such great service during all the negotiations, smoothing\r\ndown ruffed feelings by his suavity and tact and presenting difficult\r\nsubjects in a way that made action possible, that to him was accorded\r\nthe unpleasant task of communicating what had been accomplished to\r\nVergennes, the French Minister, and of requesting at the same time \"a\r\nfresh loan of twenty million francs.\" Franklin, of course, presented\r\nhis case with much \"delicacy and kindliness of manner\" and with a fair\r\ndegree of success. \"Vergennes thought that the signing of the articles\r\nwas premature, but he made no inconvenient remonstrances, and procured\r\nsix millions of the twenty.\" ¹ On September 3, 1783, the definite\r\ntreaty of peace was signed in due time it was ratified by the British\r\nParliament as well as by the American Congress. The new state, duly\r\naccredited, thus took its place in the family of nations; but it was\r\na very humble place that was first assigned to the United States of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n¹ Channing, History of the United States, vol. iii, p. 368.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II TRADE AND INDUSTRY\r\n\r\nThough the word revolution implies a violent break with the past, there\r\nwas nothing in the Revolution that transformed the essential character\r\nor the characteristics of the American people. The Revolution severed\r\nthe ties which bound the colonies to Great Britain; it created some new\r\nactivities; some soldiers were diverted from their former trades and\r\noccupation; but, as the proportion of the population engaged in the war\r\nwas relatively small and the area of country affected for any length\r\nof time was comparatively slight, it is safe to say that in general the\r\nmass of the people remained about the same after the war as before. The\r\nprofessional man was found in his same calling; the artisan returned\r\nto his tools, if he had ever laid them down; the shopkeeper resumed\r\nhis business, if it had been interrupted; the merchant went back to\r\nhis trading; and the farmer before the Revolution remained a farmer\r\nafterward.\r\n\r\nThe country as a whole was in relatively good condition and the people\r\nwere reasonably prosperous; at least, there was no general distress or\r\npoverty. Suffering had existed in the regions ravaged by war, but no\r\nsection had suffered unduly or had had to bear the burden of war during\r\nthe entire period of fighting. American products had been in demand,\r\nespecially in the West India Islands, and an illicit trade with the\r\nenemy had sprung up, so that even during the war shippers were able to\r\ndispose of their commodities at good prices. The Americans are commonly\r\nsaid to have been an agricultural people, but it would be more correct\r\nto say that the great majority of the people were dependent upon\r\nextractive industries, which would include lumbering, fishing, and even\r\nthe fur trade, as well as the ordinary agricultural pursuits. Save for\r\na few industries, of which shipbuilding was one of the most important,\r\nthere was relatively little manufacturing apart from the household\r\ncrafts. These household industries had increased during the war, but as\r\nit was with the individual so it was with the whole country; the general\r\ncourse of industrial activity was much the same as it had been before\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\nA fundamental fact is to be observed in the economy of the young nation:\r\nthe people were raising far more tobacco and grain and were extracting\r\nfar more of other products than they could possibly use themselves; for\r\nthe surplus they must find markets. They had, as well, to rely upon the\r\noutside world for a great part of their manufactured goods, especially\r\nfor those of the higher grade. In other words, from the economic point\r\nof view, the United States remained in the former colonial stage of\r\nindustrial dependence, which was aggravated rather than alleviated by\r\nthe separation from Great Britain. During the colonial period, Americans\r\nhad carried on a large amount of this external trade by means of their\r\nown vessels. The British Navigation Acts required the transportation\r\nof goods in British vessels, manned by crews of British sailors, and\r\nspecified certain commodities which could be shipped to Great Britain\r\nonly. They also required that much of the European trade should pass by\r\nway of England. But colonial vessels and colonial sailors came under\r\nthe designation of \"British,\" and no small part of the prosperity of\r\nNew England, and of the middle colonies as well, had been due to the\r\ncarrying trade. It would seem therefore as if a primary need of the\r\nAmerican people immediately after the Revolution was to get access to\r\ntheir old markets and to carry the goods as much as possible in their\r\nown vessels.\r\n\r\nIn some directions they were successful. One of the products in greatest\r\ndemand was fish. The fishing industry had been almost annihilated by the\r\nwar, but with the establishment of peace the New England fisheries began\r\nto recover. They were in competition with the fishermen of France and\r\nEngland who were aided by large bounties, yet the superior geographical\r\nadvantages which the American fishermen possessed enabled them to\r\nmaintain and expand their business, and the rehabilitation of the\r\nfishing fleet was an important feature of their programme. In other\r\ndirections they were not so successful. The British still believed in\r\ntheir colonial system and applied its principles without regard to the\r\ninterests of the United States. Such American products as they wanted\r\nthey allowed to be carried to British markets, but in British vessels.\r\nCertain commodities, the production of which they wished to encourage\r\nwithin their own dominions, they added to the prohibited list. Americans\r\ncried out indignantly that this was an attempt on the part of the\r\nBritish to punish their former colonies for their temerity in revolting.\r\nThe British Government may well have derived some satisfaction from the\r\nfact that certain restrictions bore heavily upon New England, as John\r\nAdams complained; but it would seem to be much nearer the truth to\r\nsay that in a truly characteristic way the British were phlegmatically\r\nattending to their own interests and calmly ignoring the United States,\r\nand that there was little malice in their policy.\r\n\r\nEuropean nations had regarded American trade as a profitable field\r\nof enterprise and as probably responsible for much of Great Britain's\r\nprosperity. It was therefore a relatively easy matter for the United\r\nStates to enter into commercial treaties with foreign countries. These\r\ntreaties, however, were not fruitful of any great result; for, \"with\r\nunimportant exceptions, they left still in force the high import duties\r\nand prohibitions that marked the European tariffs of the time, as well\r\nas many features of the old colonial system. They were designed to\r\nlegalize commerce rather than to encourage it.\" ¹ Still, for a year or\r\nmore after the war the demand for American products was great enough\r\nto satisfy almost everybody. But in 1784 France and Spain closed their\r\ncolonial ports and thus excluded the shipping of the United States. This\r\nproved to be so disastrous for their colonies that the French Government\r\nsoon was forced to relax its restrictions. The British also made some\r\nconcessions, and where their orders were not modified they were evaded.\r\nAnd so, in the course of a few years, the West India trade recovered.\r\n\r\n¹ Clive Day, Encyclopedia of American Government, Vol. i, p. 340.\r\n\r\nMore astonishing to the men of that time than it is to us was the fact\r\nthat American foreign trade fell under British commercial control again.\r\nWhether it was that British merchants were accustomed to American ways\r\nof doing things and knew American business conditions; whether other\r\ncountries found the commerce not as profitable as they had expected, as\r\ncertainly was the case with France; whether \"American merchants and\r\nsea captains found themselves under disadvantages due to the absence\r\nof treaty protection which they had enjoyed as English subjects\"; ² or\r\nwhether it was the necessity of trading on British capital--whatever the\r\ncause may have been--within a comparatively few years a large part\r\nof American trade was in British hands as it had been before the\r\nRevolution. American trade with Europe was carried on through English\r\nmerchants very much as the Navigation Acts had prescribed.\r\n\r\n² C. R. Fish, American Diplomacy, pp. 56-57.\r\n\r\nFrom the very first settlement of the American continent the colonists\r\nhad exhibited one of the earliest and most lasting characteristics\r\nof the American people--adaptability. The Americans now proceeded to\r\nmanifest that trait anew, not only by adjusting themselves to renewed\r\ncommercial dependence upon Great Britain, but by seeking new avenues of\r\ntrade. A striking illustration of this is to be found in the development\r\nof trade with the Far East. Captain Cook's voyage around the world\r\n(1768-1771), an account of which was first published in London in 1773,\r\nattracted a great deal of attention in America; an edition of the New\r\nVoyage was issued in New York in 1774. No sooner was the Revolution over\r\nthan there began that romantic trade with China and the northwest coast\r\nof America, which made the fortunes of some families of Salem and Boston\r\nand Philadelphia. This commerce added to the prosperity of the country,\r\nbut above all it stimulated the imagination of Americans. In the same\r\nway another outlet was found in trade with Russia by way of the Baltic.\r\n\r\nThe foreign trade of the United States after the Revolution thus passed\r\nthrough certain well-marked phases. First there was a short period of\r\nprosperity, owing to an unusual demand for American products; this\r\nwas followed by a longer period of depression; and then came a gradual\r\nrecovery through acceptance of the new conditions and adjustment to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nA similar cycle may be traced in the domestic or internal trade. In\r\nearly days intercolonial commerce had been carried on mostly by water,\r\nand when war interfered commerce almost ceased for want of roads. The\r\nloss of ocean highways, however, stimulated road building and led to\r\nwhat might be regarded as the first \"good-roads movement\" of the new\r\nnation, except that to our eyes it would be a misuse of the word to call\r\nany of those roads good. But anything which would improve the means of\r\ntransportation took on a patriotic tinge, and the building of roads and\r\nthe cutting of canals were agitated until turnpike and canal companies\r\nbecame a favorite form of investment; and in a few years the interstate\r\nland trade had grown to considerable importance. But in the meantime,\r\nwater transportation was the main reliance, and with the end of the war\r\nthe coastwise trade had been promptly resumed. For a time it prospered;\r\nbut the States, affected by the general economic conditions and by\r\njealousy, tried to interfere with and divert the trade of others to\r\ntheir own advantage. This was done by imposing fees and charges and\r\nduties, not merely upon goods and vessels from abroad but upon those of\r\ntheir fellow States. James Madison described the situation in the words\r\nso often quoted: \"Some of the States, ... having no convenient ports\r\nfor foreign commerce, were subject to be taxed by their neighbors, thro\r\nwhose ports, their commerce was carryed on. New Jersey, placed between\r\nPhila. & N. York, was likened to a Cask tapped at both ends: and N.\r\nCarolina between Virga. & S. Carolina to a patient bleeding at both\r\nArms.\" ¹\r\n\r\n¹ Records of the Federal Convention, vol. iii, p. 542.\r\n\r\nThe business depression which very naturally followed the short revival\r\nof trade was so serious in its financial consequences that it has even\r\nbeen referred to as the \"Panic of 1785.\" The United States afforded\r\na good market for imported articles in 1788 and 1784, all the better\r\nbecause of the supply of gold and silver which had been sent into the\r\ncountry by England and France to maintain their armies and fleets and\r\nwhich had remained in the United States. But this influx of imported\r\ngoods was one of the chief factors in causing the depression of 1785, as\r\nit brought ruin to many of those domestic industries which had sprung\r\nup in the days of non-intercourse or which had been stimulated by the\r\nartificial protection of the war.\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, the currency was in a confused condition. \"In\r\n1784 the entire coin of the land, except coppers, was the product of\r\nforeign mints. English guineas, crowns, shillings and pence were still\r\npaid over the counters of shops and taverns, and with them were mingled\r\nmany French and Spanish and some German coins.... The value of the gold\r\npieces expressed in dollars was pretty much the same the country over.\r\nBut the dollar and the silver pieces regarded as fractions of a dollar\r\nhad no less than five different values.\" ¹ The importation of foreign\r\ngoods was fast draining the hard money out of the country. In an effort\r\nto relieve the situation but with the result of making it much worse,\r\nseveral of the States began to issue paper money; and this was in\r\naddition to the enormous quantities of paper which had been printed\r\nduring the Revolution and which was now worth but a small fraction of\r\nits face value.\r\n\r\n¹ McMaster, History of the People of the United States, vol. i, pp.\r\n190-191.\r\n\r\nThe expanding currency and consequent depreciation in the value of money\r\nhad immediately resulted in a corresponding rise of prices, which for a\r\nwhile the States attempted to control. But in 1778 Congress threw up its\r\nhands in despair and voted that \"all limitations of prices of gold and\r\nsilver be taken off,\" although the States for some time longer continued\r\nto endeavor to regulate prices by legislation. ¹ The fluctuating value\r\nof the currency increased the opportunities for speculation which\r\nwar conditions invariably offer, and \"immense fortunes were suddenly\r\naccumulated.\" A new financial group rose into prominence composed\r\nlargely of those who were not accustomed to the use of money and who\r\nwere consequently inclined to spend it recklessly and extravagantly.\r\n\r\n¹ W. E. H. Lecky, The American Revolution, New York, 1898, pp. 288-294.\r\n\r\nMany contemporaries comment upon these things, of whom Brissot de\r\nWarville may be taken as an example, although he did not visit the\r\nUnited States until 1788:\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants ... prefer the splendor of wealth and the show of\r\nenjoyment to the simplicity of manners and the pure pleasures which\r\nresult from it. If there is a town on the American continent where the\r\nEnglish luxury displays its follies, it is New York. You will find here\r\nthe English fashions: in the dress of the women you will see the most\r\nbrilliant silks, gauzes, hats, and borrowed hair; equipages are rare,\r\nbut they are elegant; the men have more simplicity in their dress; they\r\ndisdain gewgaws, but they take their revenge in the luxury of the table;\r\nluxury forms already a class of men very dangerous to society; I mean\r\nbachelors; the expense of women causes matrimony to be dreaded by men.\r\nTea forms, as in England, the basis of parties of pleasure; many things\r\nare dearer here than in France; a hairdresser asks twenty shilling a\r\nmonth; washing costs four shillings a dozen. ¹\r\n\r\n¹ Quoted by Henry Tuckerman, America and her Commentators, 1864.\r\n\r\nAn American writer of a later date, looking back upon his earlier years,\r\nwas impressed by this same extravagance, and his testimony may well be\r\nused to strengthen the impression which it is the purpose of the present\r\nnarrative to convey:\r\n\r\nThe French and British armies circulated immense sums of money in gold\r\nand silver coin, which had the effect of driving out of circulation\r\nthe wretched paper currency which had till then prevailed. Immense\r\nquantities of British and French goods were soon imported: our people\r\nimbibed a taste for foreign fashions and luxury; and in the course of\r\ntwo or three years, from the close of the war, such an entire change had\r\ntaken place in the habits and manners of our inhabitants, that it almost\r\nappeared as if we had suddenly become a different nation. The staid\r\nand sober habits of our ancestors, with their plain home-manufactured\r\nclothing, were suddenly laid aside, and European goods of fine quality\r\nadopted in their stead. Fine ruffles, powdered heads, silks and\r\nscarlets, decorated the men; while the most costly silks, satins,\r\nchintzes, calicoes, muslins, etc., etc., decorated our females. Nor was\r\ntheir diet less expensive; for superb plate, foreign spirits, wines,\r\netc., etc., sparkled on the sideboards of many farmers. The natural\r\nresult of this change of the habits and customs of the people--this\r\naping of European manners and morals, was to suddenly drain our country\r\nof its circulating specie; and as a necessary consequence, the people\r\nran in debt, times became difficult, and money hard to raise. ¹\r\n\r\n¹; Samuel Kercheval, History of the Valley of Virginia, 1833, pp.\r\n199-200.\r\n\r\nThe situation was serious, and yet it was not as dangerous or even as\r\ncritical as it has generally been represented, because the fundamental\r\nbases of American prosperity were untouched. The way by which Americans\r\ncould meet the emergency and recover from the hard times was fairly\r\nevident--first to economize, and then to find new outlets for their\r\nindustrial energies. But the process of adjustment was slow and painful.\r\nThere were not a few persons in the United States who were even disposed\r\nto regret that Americans were not safely under British protection\r\nand prospering with Great Britain, instead of suffering in political\r\nisolation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III THE CONFEDERATION\r\n\r\nWhen peace came in 1783 there were in the United States approximately\r\nthree million people, who were spread over the whole Atlantic coast\r\nfrom Maine to Georgia and back into the interior as far as the Alleghany\r\nMountains; and a relatively small number of settlers had crossed the\r\nmountain barrier. About twenty per cent of the population, or some\r\nsix hundred thousand, were negro slaves. There was also a large alien\r\nelement of foreign birth or descent, poor when they arrived in America,\r\nand, although they had been able to raise themselves to a position of\r\ncomparative comfort, life among them was still crude and rough. Many\r\nof the people were poorly educated and lacking in cultivation and\r\nrefinement and in a knowledge of the usages of good society. Not only\r\nwere they looked down upon by other nations of the world; there was\r\nwithin the United States itself a relatively small upper class inclined\r\nto regard the mass of the people as of an inferior order.\r\n\r\nThus, while forces were at work favorable to democracy, the gentry\r\nremained in control of affairs after the Revolution, although their\r\nnumbers were reduced by the emigration of the Loyalists and their power\r\nwas lessened. The explanation of this aristocratic control may be found\r\nin the fact that the generation of the Revolution had been accustomed\r\nto monarchy and to an upper class and that the people were wont to\r\ntake their ideas and to accept suggestions from their betters without\r\nquestion or murmur. This deferential attitude is attested by the\r\nindifference of citizens to the right of voting. In our own day, before\r\nthe great extension of woman suffrage, the number of persons voting\r\napproximated twenty per cent of the population, but after the Revolution\r\nless than five per cent of the white population voted. There were many\r\nlimitations upon the exercise of the suffrage, but the small number of\r\nvoters was only partially due to these restrictions, for in later years,\r\nwithout any radical change in suffrage qualifications, the proportion of\r\ncitizens who voted steadily increased.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that many of the people did not care to vote. Why should\r\nthey, when they were only registering the will or the wishes of their\r\nsuperiors? But among the relatively small number who constituted the\r\ngoverning class there was a high standard of intelligence. Popular\r\nmagazines were unheard of and newspapers were infrequent, so that men\r\ndepended largely upon correspondence and personal intercourse for the\r\ninterchange of ideas. There was time, however, for careful reading of\r\nthe few available books; there was time for thought, for writing, for\r\ndiscussion, and for social intercourse. It hardly seems too much to say,\r\ntherefore, that there was seldom, if ever, a people--certainly never\r\na people scattered over so wide a territory--who knew so much about\r\ngovernment as did this controlling element of the people of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe practical character, as well as the political genius, of the\r\nAmericans was never shown to better advantage than at the outbreak of\r\nthe Revolution, when the quarrel with the mother country was manifesting\r\nitself in the conflict between the Governors, and other appointed\r\nagents of the Crown, and the popularly elected houses of the colonial\r\nlegislatures. When the Crown resorted to dissolving the legislatures,\r\nthe revolting colonists kept up and observed the forms of government.\r\nWhen the legislature was prevented from meeting, the members would come\r\ntogether and call themselves a congress or a convention, and, instead of\r\nadopting laws or orders, would issue what were really nothing more\r\nthan recommendations, but which they expected would be obeyed by their\r\nsupporters. To enforce these recommendations extra-legal committees,\r\ngenerally backed by public opinion and sometimes concretely supported by\r\nan organized \"mob,\" would meet in towns and counties and would be often\r\neffectively centralized where the opponents of the British policy were\r\nin control.\r\n\r\nIn several of the colonies the want of orderly government became so\r\nserious that, in 1775, the Continental Congress advised them to form\r\ntemporary governments until the trouble with Great Britain had been\r\nsettled. When independence was declared Congress recommended to all the\r\nStates that they should adopt governments of their own. In accordance\r\nwith that recommendation, in the course of a very few years each\r\nState established an independent government and adopted a written\r\nconstitution. It was a time when men believed in the social contract\r\nor the \"compact theory of the state,\" that states originated through\r\nagreement, as the case might be, between king and nobles, between king\r\nand people, or among the people themselves. In support of this doctrine\r\nno less an authority than the Bible was often quoted, such a passage for\r\nexample as II Samuel v, 3: \"So all the elders of Israel came to the King\r\nto Hebron; and King David made a covenant with them in Hebron before\r\nthe Lord; and they anointed David King over Israel.\" As a philosophical\r\nspeculation to explain why people were governed or consented to be\r\ngoverned, this theory went back at least to the Greeks, and doubtless\r\nmuch earlier; and, though of some significance in medieval thought, it\r\nbecame of greater importance in British political philosophy, especially\r\nthrough the works of Thomas Hobbes and John Locke. A very practical\r\napplication of the compact theory was made in the English Revolution of\r\n1688, when in order to avoid the embarrassment of deposing the king, the\r\nconvention of the Parliament adopted the resolution: \"That King James\r\nthe Second, having endeavored to subvert the Constitution of the\r\nKingdom, by breaking the original Contract between King and People, and\r\nhaving, by the advice of Jesuits, and other wicked persons, violated\r\nthe fundamental Laws, and withdrawn himself out of this Kingdom, has\r\nabdicated the Government, and that the throne is hereby vacant.\"\r\nThese theories were developed by Jean Jacques Rousseau in his Contrat\r\nSocial--a book so attractively written that it eclipsed all other works\r\nupon the subject and resulted in his being regarded as the author of the\r\ndoctrine--and through him they spread all over Europe.\r\n\r\nConditions in America did more than lend color to pale speculation; they\r\nseemed to take this hypothesis out of the realm of theory and to give it\r\npractical application. What happened when men went into the wilderness\r\nto live? The Pilgrim Fathers on board the Mayflower entered into an\r\nagreement which was signed by the heads of families who took part in the\r\nenterprise: \"We, whose names are underwritten ... Do by these presents,\r\nsolemnly and mutually, in the Presence of God and one another, covenant\r\nand combine ourselves together into a civil Body Politick.\"\r\n\r\nOther colonies, especially in New England, with this example before\r\nthem of a social contract entered into similar compacts or \"plantation\r\ncovenants,\" as they were called. But the colonists were also accustomed\r\nto having written charters granted which continued for a time at least\r\nto mark the extent of governmental powers. Through this intermingling\r\nof theory and practice it was the most natural thing in the world, when\r\nAmericans came to form their new State Governments, that they should\r\nprovide written instruments framed by their own representatives,\r\nwhich not only bound them to be governed in this way but also placed\r\nlimitations upon the governing bodies. As the first great series\r\nof written constitutions, these frames of government attracted wide\r\nattention. Congress printed a set for general distribution, and numerous\r\neditions were circulated both at home and abroad.\r\n\r\nThe constitutions were brief documents, varying from one thousand to\r\ntwelve thousand words in length, which established the framework of the\r\ngovernmental machinery. Most of them, before proceeding to practical\r\nworking details, enunciated a series of general principles upon the\r\nsubject of government and political morality in what were called\r\ndeclarations or bills of rights. The character of these declarations may\r\nbe gathered from the following excerpts:\r\n\r\nThat all men are by nature equally free and independent, and have\r\ncertain inherent rights, ... the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the\r\nmeans of acquiring and possessing property, and pursuing and obtaining\r\nhappiness and safety.\r\n\r\nThat no man, or set of men, are entitled to exclusive or separate\r\nemoluments or privileges from the community, but in consideration of\r\npublic services.\r\n\r\nThe body politic is formed by a voluntary association of individuals;\r\nit is a social compact by which the whole people covenants with each\r\ncitizen and each citizen with the whole people that all shall be\r\ngoverned by certain laws for the common good.\r\n\r\nThat all power of suspending laws, or the execution of laws, by any\r\nauthority, without consent of the representatives of the people, is\r\ninjurious to their rights, and ought not to be exercised.\r\n\r\nThat general warrants, ... are grievous and oppressive, and ought not to\r\nbe granted.\r\n\r\nAll penalties ought to be proportioned to the nature of the offence.\r\n\r\nThat sanguinary laws ought to be avoided, as far as is consistent with\r\nthe safety of the State; and no law, to inflict cruel and unusual pains\r\nand penalties, ought to be made in any case, or at any time hereafter.\r\n\r\nNo magistrate or court of law shall demand excessive bail or sureties,\r\nimpose excessive fines ...\r\n\r\nEvery individual has a natural and unalienable right to worship God\r\naccording to the dictates of his own conscience, and reason; ...\r\n\r\nThat the freedom of the press is one of the great bulwarks of liberty,\r\nand can never be restrained but by despotic governments.\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived at once that these are but variations of the\r\nEnglish Declaration of Rights of 1689, which indeed was consciously\r\nfollowed as a model; and yet there is a world-wide difference between\r\nthe English model and these American copies. The earlier document\r\nenunciated the rights of English subjects, the recent infringement of\r\nwhich made it desirable that they should be reasserted in convincing\r\nform. The American documents asserted rights which the colonists\r\ngenerally had enjoyed and which they declared to be \"governing\r\nprinciples for all peoples in all future times.\"\r\n\r\nBut the greater significance of these State Constitutions is to be found\r\nin their quality as working instruments of government. There was\r\nindeed little difference between the old colonial and the new State\r\nGovernments. The inhabitants of each of the Thirteen States had been\r\naccustomed to a large measure of self-government, and when they took\r\nmatters into their own hands they were not disposed to make any radical\r\nchanges in the forms to which they had become accustomed. Accordingly\r\nthe State Governments that were adopted simply continued a framework of\r\ngovernment almost identical with that of colonial times. To be sure, the\r\nGovernor and other appointed officials were now elected either by the\r\npeople or the legislature, and so were ultimately responsible to the\r\nelectors instead of to the Crown; and other changes were made which in\r\nthe long run might prove of far-reaching and even of vital significance;\r\nand yet the machinery of government seemed the same as that to which\r\nthe people were already accustomed. The average man was conscious of no\r\ndifference at all in the working of the Government under the new order.\r\nIn fact, in Connecticut and Rhode Island, the most democratic of all\r\nthe colonies, where the people had been privileged to elect their own\r\ngovernors, as well as legislatures, no change whatever was necessary and\r\nthe old charters were continued as State Constitutions down to 1818 and\r\n1842, respectively.\r\n\r\nTo one who has been accustomed to believe that the separation from a\r\nmonarchical government meant the establishment of democracy, a reading\r\nof these first State Constitutions is likely to cause a rude shock.\r\nA shrewd English observer, traveling a generation later in the United\r\nStates, went to the root of the whole matter in remarking of the\r\nAmericans that, \"When their independence was achieved their mental\r\ncondition was not instantly changed. Their deference for rank and for\r\njudicial and legislative authority continued nearly unimpaired.\" ¹ They\r\nmight declare that \"all men are created equal,\" and bills of rights\r\nmight assert that government rested upon the consent of the governed;\r\nbut these constitutions carefully provided that such consent should\r\ncome from property owners, and, in many of the States, from religious\r\nbelievers and even followers of the Christian faith. \"The man of small\r\nmeans might vote, but none save well-to-do Christians could legislate,\r\nand in many states none but a rich Christian could be a governor.\" ² In\r\nSouth Carolina, for example, a freehold of £10,000 currency was required\r\nof the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, and members of the Council; £2,000\r\nof the members of the Senate; and, while every elector was eligible to\r\nthe House of Representatives, he had to acknowledge the being of a God\r\nand to believe in a future state of rewards and punishments, as well as\r\nto hold \"a freehold at least of fifty acres of land, or a town lot.\"\r\n\r\n¹ George Combe, Tour of the United States, vol. i, p. 205.\r\n\r\n² McMaster, Acquisition of Industrial, Popular, and Political Rights of\r\nMan in America, p. 20.\r\n\r\nIt was government by a property-owning class, but in comparison with\r\nother countries this class represented a fairly large and increasing\r\nproportion of the population. In America the opportunity of becoming a\r\nproperty-owner was open to every one, or, as that phrase would then\r\nhave been understood, to most white men. This system of class control is\r\nillustrated by the fact that, with the exception of Massachusetts, the\r\nnew State Constitutions were never submitted to the people for approval.\r\n\r\nThe democratic sympathizer of today is inclined to point to those\r\nfirst State Governments as a continuance of the old order. But to the\r\nconservative of that time it seemed as if radical and revolutionary\r\nchanges were taking place. The bills of rights declared, \"That no men,\r\nor set of men, are entitled to exclusive or separate emoluments or\r\nprivileges from the community, but in consideration of public services.\"\r\nProperty qualifications and other restrictions on office-holding and the\r\nexercise of the suffrage were lessened. Four States declared in their\r\nconstitutions against the entailment of estates, and primogeniture\r\nwas abolished in aristocratic Virginia. There was a fairly complete\r\nabolition of all vestiges of feudal tenure in the holding of land, so\r\nthat it may be said that in this period full ownership of property was\r\nestablished. The further separation of church and state was also carried\r\nout.\r\n\r\nCertainly leveling influences were at work, and the people as a whole\r\nhad moved one step farther in the direction of equality and democracy,\r\nand it was well that the Revolution was not any more radical and\r\nrevolutionary than it was. The change was gradual and therefore more\r\nlasting. One finds readily enough contemporary statements to the effect\r\nthat, \"Although there are no nobles in America, there is a class of men\r\ndenominated 'gentlemen,' who, by reason of their wealth, their talents,\r\ntheir education, their families, or the offices they hold, aspire to a\r\npreëminence,\" but, the same observer adds, this is something which\r\n\"the people refuse to grant them.\" Another contemporary contributes the\r\nobservation that there was not so much respect paid to gentlemen of rank\r\nas there should be, and that the lower orders of people behave as if\r\nthey were on a footing of equality with them.\r\n\r\nWhether the State Constitutions are to be regarded as\r\nproperty-conserving, aristocratic instruments, or as progressive\r\ndocuments, depends upon the point of view. And so it is with the spirit\r\nof union or of nationality in the United States. One student emphasizes\r\nthe fact of there being \"thirteen independent republics differing ...\r\nwidely in climate, in soil, in occupation, in everything which makes\r\nup the social and economic life of the people\"; while another sees \"the\r\nUnited States a nation.\" There is something to be said for both sides,\r\nand doubtless the truth lies between them, for there were forces making\r\nfor disintegration as well as for unification. To the student of the\r\npresent day, however, the latter seem to have been the stronger and more\r\nimportant, although the possibility was never absent that the thirteen\r\nStates would go their separate ways.\r\n\r\nThere are few things so potent as a common danger to bring discordant\r\nelements into working harmony. Several times in the century and a half\r\nof their existence, when the colonies found themselves threatened by\r\ntheir enemies, they had united, or at least made an effort to unite,\r\nfor mutual help. The New England Confederation of 1643 was organized\r\nprimarily for protection against the Indians and incidentally against\r\nthe Dutch and French. Whenever trouble threatened with any of the\r\nEuropean powers or with the Indians--and that was frequently--a plan\r\nwould be broached for getting the colonies to combine their efforts,\r\nsometimes for the immediate necessity and sometimes for a broader\r\npurpose. The best known of these plans was that presented to the Albany\r\nCongress of 1754, which had been called to make effective preparation\r\nfor the inevitable struggle with the French and Indians. The beginning\r\nof the troubles which culminated in the final breach with Great Britain\r\nhad quickly brought united action in the form of the Stamp Act\r\nCongress of 1765, in the Committees of Correspondence, and then in the\r\nContinental Congress.\r\n\r\nIt was not merely that the leaven of the Revolution was already working\r\nto bring about the freer interchange of ideas; instinct and experience\r\nled the colonies to united action. The very day that the Continental\r\nCongress appointed a committee to frame a declaration of independence,\r\nanother committee was ordered to prepare articles of union. A month\r\nlater, as soon as the Declaration of Independence had been adopted, this\r\nsecond committee, of which John Dickinson of Pennsylvania was chairman,\r\npresented to Congress a report in the form of Articles of Confederation.\r\nAlthough the outbreak of fighting made some sort of united action\r\nimperative, this plan of union was subjected to debate intermittently\r\nfor over sixteen months and even after being adopted by Congress, toward\r\nthe end of 1777, it was not ratified by the States until March, 1781,\r\nwhen the war was already drawing to a close. The exigencies of the hour\r\nforced Congress, without any authorization, to act as if it had been\r\nduly empowered and in general to proceed as if the Confederation had\r\nbeen formed.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin was an enthusiast for union. It was he who had\r\nsubmitted the plan of union to the Albany Congress in 1754, which with\r\nmodifications was recommended by that congress for adoption. It provided\r\nfor a Grand Council of representatives chosen by the legislature of\r\neach colony, the members to be proportioned to the contribution of\r\nthat colony to the American military service. In matters concerning the\r\ncolonies as a whole, especially in Indian affairs, the Grand Council was\r\nto be given extensive powers of legislation and taxation. The executive\r\nwas to be a President or Governor-General, appointed and paid by the\r\nCrown, with the right of nominating all military officers, and with a\r\nveto upon all acts of the Grand Council. The project was far in advance\r\nof the times and ultimately failed of acceptance, but in 1775, with the\r\nbeginning of the troubles with Great Britain, Franklin took his Albany\r\nplan and, after modifying it in accordance with the experience of\r\ntwenty years, submitted it to the Continental Congress as a new plan of\r\ngovernment under which the colonies might unite.\r\n\r\nFranklin's plan of 1775 seems to have attracted little attention in\r\nAmerica, and possibly it was not generally known; but much was made of\r\nit abroad, where it soon became public, probably in the same way that\r\nother Franklin papers came out. It seems to have been his practice to\r\nmake, with his own hand, several copies of such a document, which he\r\nwould send to his friends with the statement that as the document in\r\nquestion was confidential they might not otherwise see a copy of it. Of\r\ncourse the inevitable happened, and such documents found their way into\r\nprint to the apparent surprise and dismay of the author. Incidentally\r\nthis practice caused confusion in later years, because each possessor of\r\nsuch a document would claim that he had the original. Whatever may have\r\nbeen the procedure in this particular case, it is fairly evident that\r\nDickinson's committee took Franklin's plan of 1775 as the starting\r\npoint of its work, and after revision submitted it to Congress as their\r\nreport; for some of the most important features of the Articles of\r\nConfederation are to be found, sometimes word for word, in Franklin's\r\ndraft.\r\n\r\nThis explanation of the origin of the Articles of Confederation is\r\nhelpful and perhaps essential in understanding the form of government\r\nestablished, because that government in its main features had been\r\ndevised for an entirely different condition of affairs, when a strong,\r\ncentralized government would not have been accepted even if it had\r\nbeen wanted. It provided for a \"league of friendship,\" with the primary\r\npurpose of considering preparation for action rather than of taking the\r\ninitiative. Furthermore, the final stages of drafting the Articles of\r\nConfederation had occurred at the outbreak of the war, when the people\r\nof the various States were showing a disposition to follow readily\r\nsuggestions that came from those whom they could trust and when they\r\nseemed to be willing to submit without compulsion to orders from the\r\nsame source. These circumstances, quite as much as the inexperience of\r\nCongress and the jealousy of the States, account for the inefficient\r\nform of government which was devised; and inefficient the Confederation\r\ncertainly was. The only organ of government was a Congress in which\r\nevery State was entitled to one vote and was represented by a delegation\r\nwhose members were appointed annually as the legislature of the State\r\nmight direct, whose expenses were paid by the State, and who were\r\nsubject to recall. In other words, it was a council of States whose\r\nrepresentatives had little incentive to independence of action.\r\n\r\nExtensive powers were granted to this Congress \"of determining on peace\r\nand war, ... of entering into treaties and alliances,\" of maintaining an\r\narmy and a navy, of establishing post offices, of coining money, and\r\nof making requisitions upon the States for their respective share of\r\nexpenses \"incurred for the common defence or general welfare.\" But none\r\nof these powers could be exercised without the consent of nine States,\r\nwhich was equivalent to requiring a two-thirds vote, and even when such\r\na vote had been obtained and a decision had been reached, there\r\nwas nothing to compel the individual States to obey beyond the mere\r\ndeclaration in the Articles of Confederation that, \"Every State shall\r\nabide by the determinations of the United States in Congress assembled.\"\r\n\r\nNo executive was provided for except that Congress was authorized \"to\r\nappoint such other committees and civil officers as may be necessary\r\nfor managing the general affairs of the United States under their\r\ndirection.\" In judicial matters, Congress was to serve as \"the last\r\nresort on appeal in all disputes and differences\" between States; and\r\nCongress might establish courts for the trial of piracy and felonies\r\ncommitted on the high seas and for determining appeals in cases of prize\r\ncapture.\r\n\r\nThe plan of a government was there but it lacked any driving force.\r\nCongress might declare war but the States might decline to participate\r\nin it; Congress might enter into treaties but it could not make the\r\nStates live up to them; Congress might borrow money but it could not be\r\nsure of repaying it; and Congress might decide disputes without being\r\nable to make the parties accept the decision. The pressure of necessity\r\nmight keep the States together for a time, yet there is no disguising\r\nthe fact that the Articles of Confederation formed nothing more than a\r\ngentlemen's agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV THE NORTHWEST ORDINANCE\r\n\r\nThe population of the United States was like a body of water that was\r\nbeing steadily enlarged by internal springs and external tributaries. It\r\nwas augmented both from within and from without, from natural increase\r\nand from immigration. It had spread over the whole coast from Maine to\r\nGeorgia and slowly back into the interior, at first along the lines of\r\nriver communication and then gradually filling up the spaces between\r\nuntil the larger part of the available land east of the Alleghany\r\nMountains was settled. There the stream was checked as if dammed by the\r\nmountain barrier, but the population was trickling through wherever it\r\ncould find an opening, slowly wearing channels, until finally, when the\r\nobstacles were overcome, it broke through with a rush.\r\n\r\nTwenty years before the Revolution the expanding population had reached\r\nthe mountains and was ready to go beyond. The difficulty of crossing the\r\nmountains was not insuperable, but the French and Indian War, followed\r\nby Pontiac's Conspiracy, made outlying frontier settlement dangerous if\r\nnot impossible. The arbitrary restriction of western settlement by the\r\nProclamation of 1763 did not stop the more adventurous but did hold back\r\nthe mass of the population until near the time of the Revolution, when\r\na few bands of settlers moved into Kentucky and Tennessee and rendered\r\nimportant but inconspicuous service in the fighting. But so long as\r\nthe title to that territory was in doubt no considerable body of people\r\nwould move into it, and it was not until the Treaty of Peace in 1783\r\ndetermined that the western country as far as the Mississippi River was\r\nto belong to the United States that the dammed-up population broke over\r\nthe mountains in a veritable flood.\r\n\r\nThe western country and its people presented no easy problem to the\r\nUnited States: how to hold those people when the pull was strong to draw\r\nthem from the Union; how to govern citizens so widely separated from the\r\nolder communities; and, of most immediate importance, how to hold the\r\nland itself. It was, indeed, the question of the ownership of the land\r\nbeyond the mountains which delayed the ratification of the Articles of\r\nConfederation. Some of the States, by right of their colonial charter\r\ngrants \"from sea to sea,\" were claiming large parts of the western\r\nregion. Other States, whose boundaries were fixed, could put forward\r\nno such claims; and, as they were therefore limited in their area\r\nof expansion, they were fearful lest in the future they should be\r\noverbalanced by those States which might obtain extensive property in\r\nthe West. It was maintained that the Proclamation of 1763 had changed\r\nthis western territory into \"Crown lands,\" and as, by the Treaty of\r\nPeace, the title had passed to the United States, the non-claimant\r\nStates had demanded in self-defense that the western land should belong\r\nto the country as a whole and not to the individual States. Rhode\r\nIsland, Maryland, and Delaware were most seriously affected, and they\r\nwere insistent upon this point. Rhode Island and at length Delaware gave\r\nin, so that by February, 1779, Maryland alone held out. In May of\r\nthat year the instructions of Maryland to her delegates were read in\r\nCongress, positively forbidding them to ratify the plan of union unless\r\nthey should receive definite assurances that the western country would\r\nbecome the common property of the United States. As the consent of\r\nall of the Thirteen States was necessary to the establishment of the\r\nConfederation, this refusal of Maryland brought matters to a crisis.\r\nThe question was eagerly discussed, and early in 1780 the deadlock was\r\nbroken by the action of New York in authorizing her representatives to\r\ncede her entire claim in western lands to the United States.\r\n\r\nIt matters little that the claim of New York was not as good as that\r\nof some of the other States, especially that of Virginia. The whole\r\nsituation was changed. It was no longer necessary for Maryland to\r\ndefend her position; but the claimant States were compelled to justify\r\nthemselves before the country for not following New York's example.\r\nCongress wisely refrained from any assertion of jurisdiction, and only\r\nurgently recommended that States having claims to western lands should\r\ncede them in order that the one obstacle to the final ratification of\r\nthe Articles of Confederation might be removed.\r\n\r\nWithout much question Virginia's claim was the strongest; but the\r\npressure was too great even for her, and she finally yielded, ceding to\r\nthe United States, upon certain conditions, all her lands northwest of\r\nthe Ohio River. Then the Maryland delegates were empowered to ratify the\r\nArticles of Confederation. This was early in 1781, and in a very short\r\ntime the other States had followed the example of New York and Virginia.\r\nCertain of the conditions imposed by Virginia were not acceptable to\r\nCongress, and three years later, upon specific request, that State\r\nwithdrew the objectionable conditions and made the cession absolute.\r\n\r\nThe territory thus ceded, north and west of the Ohio River, constituted\r\nthe public domain. Its boundaries were somewhat indefinite, but\r\nsubsequent surveys confirmed the rough estimate that it contained from\r\none to two hundred millions of acres. It was supposed to be worth, on\r\nthe average, about a dollar an acre, which would make this property an\r\nasset sufficient to meet the debts of the war and to leave a balance\r\nfor the running expenses of the Government. It thereby became one of the\r\nstrong bonds holding the Union together.\r\n\r\n\"Land!\" was the first cry of the storm-tossed mariners of Columbus. For\r\nthree centuries the leading fact of American history has been that soon\r\nafter 1600 a body of Europeans, mostly Englishmen, settled on the edge\r\nof the greatest piece of unoccupied agricultural land in the temperate\r\nzone, and proceeded to subdue it to the uses of man. For three centuries\r\nthe chief task of American mankind has been to go up westward against\r\nthe land and to possess it. Our wars, our independence, our state\r\nbuilding, our political democracy, our plasticity with respect to\r\nimmigration, our mobility of thought, our ardor of initiative, our\r\nmildness and our prosperity, all are but incidents or products of this\r\nprime historical fact. ¹\r\n\r\n¹ Lecture by J. Franklin Jameson before the Trustees of the Carnegie\r\nInstitution, at Washington, in 1912, printed in the History Teacher's\r\nMagazine, vol. iv, 1913, p. 5.\r\n\r\nIt is seldom that one's attention is so caught and held as by the\r\nhappy suggestion that American interest in land--or rather interest\r\nin American land--began with the discovery of the continent. Even\r\na momentary consideration of the subject, however, is sufficient\r\nto indicate how important was the desire for land as a motive of\r\ncolonization. The foundation of European governmental and social\r\norganizations had been laid in feudalism--a system of landholding and\r\nservice. And although European states might have lost their original\r\nfeudal character, and although new classes had arisen, land-holding\r\nstill remained the basis of social distinction.\r\n\r\nOne can readily imagine that America would be considered as El Dorado,\r\nwhere one of the rarest commodities as well as one of the most precious\r\npossessions was found in almost unlimited quantities and could be had\r\nfor the asking. It is no wonder that family estates were sought in\r\nAmerica and that to the lower classes it seemed as if a heaven were\r\nopening on earth. Even though available land appeared to be almost\r\nunlimited in quantity and easy to acquire, it was a possession that was\r\ngenerally increasing in value. Of course wasteful methods of farming\r\nwore out some lands, especially in the South; but, taking it by and\r\nlarge throughout the country, with time and increasing density of\r\npopulation the value of the land was increasing. The acquisition of\r\nland was a matter of investment or at least of speculation. In fact, the\r\npurchase of land was one of the favorite get-rich-quick schemes of the\r\ntime. George Washington was not the only man who invested largely in\r\nwestern lands. A list of those who did would read like a political\r\nor social directory of the time. Patrick Henry, James Wilson, Robert\r\nMorris, Gouverneur Morris, Chancellor Kent, Henry Knox, and James Monroe\r\nwere among them. ¹\r\n\r\n¹ Not all the speculators were able to keep what they acquired. Fifteen\r\nmillion acres of land in Kentucky were offered for sale in 1800 for\r\nnon-payment of taxes. Channing, History of the United States, vol. iv,\r\np. 91.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore easy to understand why so much importance attached to\r\nthe claims of the several States and to the cession of that western land\r\nby them to the United States. But something more was necessary. If\r\nthe land was to attain anything like its real value, settlers must be\r\ninduced to occupy it. Of course it was possible to let the people go out\r\nas they pleased and take up land, and to let the Government collect\r\nfrom them as might be possible at a fixed rate. But experience during\r\ncolonial days had shown the weakness of such a method, and Congress was\r\napparently determined to keep under its own control the region which\r\nit now possessed, to provide for orderly sale, and to permit settlement\r\nonly so far as it might not endanger the national interests. The method\r\nof land sales and the question of government for the western country\r\nwere recognized as different aspects of the same problem. The Virginia\r\noffer of cession forced the necessity of a decision, and no sooner\r\nwas the Virginia offer framed in an acceptable form, in 1783, than two\r\ncommittees were appointed by Congress to report upon these two questions\r\nof land sales and of government.\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson was made chairman of both these committees. He was then\r\nforty years old and one of the most remarkable men in the country. Born\r\non the frontier--his father from the upper middle class, his mother \"a\r\nRandolph\"--he had been trained to an outdoor life; but he was also\r\na prodigy in his studies and entered William and Mary College with\r\nadvanced standing at the age of eighteen. Many stories are told of his\r\nprecocity and ability, all of which tend to forecast the later man of\r\ncatholic tastes, omnivorous interest, and extensive but superficial\r\nknowledge; he was a strange combination of natural aristocrat and\r\ntheoretical democrat, of philosopher and practical politician. After\r\nhaving been a student in the law office of George Wythe, and being\r\na friend of Patrick Henry, Jefferson early espoused the cause of\r\nthe Revolution, and it was his hand that drafted the Declaration\r\nof Independence. He then resigned from Congress to assist in the\r\norganization of government in his own State. For two years and a half he\r\nserved in the Virginia Assembly and brought about the repeal of the\r\nlaw of entailment, the abolition of primogeniture, the recognition\r\nof freedom of conscience, and the encouragement of education. He was\r\nGovernor of Virginia for two years and then, having declined reëlection,\r\nreturned to Congress in 1783. There, among his other accomplishments,\r\nas chairman of the committee, he reported the Treaty of Peace and, as\r\nchairman of another committee, devised and persuaded Congress to adopt a\r\nnational system of coinage which in its essentials is still in use.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to criticize Jefferson and to pick flaws in the things that\r\nhe said as well as in the things that he did, but practically every\r\none admits that he was closely in touch with the course of events\r\nand understood the temper of his contemporaries. In this period of\r\ntransition from the old order to the new, he seems to have expressed the\r\ngenius of American institutions better than almost any other man of his\r\ngeneration. He possessed a quality that enabled him, in the Declaration\r\nof Independence, to give voice to the hopes and aspirations of a rising\r\nnationality and that enabled him in his own State to bring about so many\r\nreforms.\r\n\r\nJust how much actual influence Thomas Jefferson had in the framing\r\nof the American land policy is not clear. Although the draft of the\r\ncommittee report in 1784 is in Jefferson's handwriting, it is altogether\r\nprobable that more credit is to be given to Thomas Hutchins, the\r\nGeographer of the United States, and to William Grayson of Virginia,\r\nespecially for the final form which the measure took; for Jefferson\r\nretired from the chairmanship and had already gone to Europe when the\r\nLand Ordinance was adopted by Congress in 1785. This ordinance has been\r\nsuperseded by later enactments, to which references are usually made;\r\nbut the original ordinance is one of the great pieces of American\r\nlegislation, for it contained the fundamentals of the American land\r\nsystem which, with the modifications experience has introduced, has\r\nproved to be permanently workable and which has been envied and in\r\nseveral instances copied by other countries. Like almost all successful\r\ninstitutions of that sort, the Land Ordinance of 1785 was not an\r\nimmediate creation but was a development out of former practices and\r\ncustoms and was in the nature of a compromise. Its essential features\r\nwere the method of survey and the process for the sale of land. New\r\nEngland, with its town system, had in the course of its expansion been\r\naccustomed to proceed in an orderly method but on a relatively small\r\nscale. The South, on the other hand, had granted lands on a larger scale\r\nand had permitted individual selection in a haphazard manner. The plan\r\nwhich Congress adopted was that of the New England survey with the\r\nSouthern method of extensive holdings. The system is repellent in its\r\nrectangular orderliness, but it made the process of recording titles\r\neasy and complete, and it was capable of indefinite expansion. These\r\nwere matters of cardinal importance, for in the course of one hundred\r\nand forty years the United States was to have under its control nearly\r\ntwo thousand million acres of land.\r\n\r\nThe primary feature of the land policy was the orderly survey in advance\r\nof sale. In the next place the township was taken as the unit, and its\r\nsize was fixed at six miles square. Provision was then made for the sale\r\nof townships alternately entire and by sections of one mile square, or\r\n640 acres each. In every township a section was reserved for educational\r\npurposes; that is, the land was to be disposed of and the proceeds used\r\nfor the development of public schools in that region. And, finally, the\r\nUnited States reserved four sections in the center of each township to\r\nbe disposed of at a later time. It was expected that a great increase\r\nin the value of the land would result, and it was proposed that the\r\nGovernment should reap a part of the profits.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the primary purpose of the public land policy as\r\nfirst developed was to acquire revenue for the Government; but it\r\nwas also evident that there was a distinct purpose of encouraging\r\nsettlement. The two were not incompatible, but the greater interest of\r\nthe Government was in obtaining a return for the property.\r\n\r\nThe other committee of which Jefferson was chairman made its report of a\r\nplan for the government of the western territory upon the very day that\r\nthe Virginia cession was finally accepted, March 1, 1784; and with some\r\nimportant modifications Jefferson's ordinance, or the Ordinance of\r\n1784 as it was commonly called, was ultimately adopted. In this case\r\nJefferson rendered a service similar to that of framing the Declaration\r\nof Independence. His plan was somewhat theoretical and visionary,\r\nbut largely practical, and it was constructive work of a high order,\r\ndisplaying not so much originality as sympathetic appreciation of what\r\nhad already been done and an instinctive forecast of future development.\r\nJefferson seemed to be able to gather up ideas, some conscious and some\r\nlatent in men's minds, and to express them in a form that was generally\r\nacceptable.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to find in the Articles of Confederation (Article\r\nXI) that, \"Canada acceding to this confederation, and joining in the\r\nmeasures of the United States, shall be admitted into, and entitled to\r\nall the advantages of this Union: but no other colony shall be admitted\r\ninto the same unless such admission be agreed to by nine States.\" The\r\nreal importance of this article lay in the suggestion of an enlargement\r\nof the Confederation. The Confederation was never intended to be a union\r\nof only thirteen States. Before the cession of their western claims it\r\nseemed to be inevitable that some of the States should be broken up into\r\nseveral units. At the very time that the formation of the Confederation\r\nwas under discussion Vermont issued a declaration of independence from\r\nNew York and New Hampshire, with the expectation of being admitted into\r\nthe Union. It was impolitic to recognize the appeal at that time, but\r\nit seems to have been generally understood that sooner or later Vermont\r\nwould come in as a full-fledged State.\r\n\r\nIt might have been a revolutionary suggestion by Maryland, when the\r\ncession of western lands was under discussion, that Congress should have\r\nsole power to fix the western boundaries of the States, but her further\r\nproposal was not even regarded as radical, that Congress should \"lay\r\nout the land beyond the boundaries so ascertained into separate and\r\nindependent states.\" It seems to have been taken as a matter of course\r\nin the procedure of Congress and was accepted by the States. But the\r\nidea was one thing; its carrying out was quite another. Here was a great\r\nextent of western territory which would be valuable only as it could\r\nbe sold to prospective settlers. One of the first things these settlers\r\nwould demand was protection--protection against the Indians, possibly\r\nalso against the British and the Spanish, and protection in their\r\nordinary civil life. The former was a detail of military organization\r\nand was in due time provided by the establishment of military forts and\r\ngarrisons; the latter was the problem which Jefferson's committee was\r\nattempting to solve.\r\n\r\nThe Ordinance of 1784 disregarded the natural physical features of the\r\nwestern country and, by degrees of latitude and meridians of longitude,\r\narbitrarily divided the public domain into rectangular districts, to the\r\nfirst of which the following names were applied: Sylvania, Michigania,\r\nCherronesus, Assenisipia, Metropotamia, Illinoia, Saratoga, Washington,\r\nPolypotamia, Pelisipia. The amusement which this absurd and thoroughly\r\nJeffersonian nomenclature is bound to cause ought not to detract from\r\nthe really important features of the Ordinance. In each of the districts\r\ninto which the country was divided the settlers might be authorized by\r\nCongress, for the purpose of establishing a temporary government, to\r\nadopt the constitution and laws of any one of the original States. When\r\nany such area should have twenty thousand free inhabitants it might\r\nreceive authority from Congress to establish a permanent constitution\r\nand government and should be entitled to a representative in Congress\r\nwith the right of debating but not of voting. And finally, when the\r\ninhabitants of any one of these districts should equal in number those\r\nof the least populous of the thirteen original States, their delegates\r\nshould be admitted into Congress on an equal footing.\r\n\r\nJefferson's ordinance, though adopted, was never put into operation.\r\nVarious explanations have been offered for this failure to give it a\r\nfair trial. It has been said that Jefferson himself was to blame. In the\r\noriginal draft of his ordinance Jefferson had provided for the abolition\r\nof slavery in the new States after the year 1800, and when\r\nCongress refused to accept this clause Jefferson, in a manner quite\r\ncharacteristic, seemed to lose all interest in the plan. There were,\r\nhowever, other objections, for there were those who felt that it was\r\nsomewhat indefinite to promise admission into the Confederation of\r\ncertain sections of the country as soon as their population should equal\r\nin number that of the least populous of the original States. If the\r\noriginal States should increase in population to any extent, the new\r\nStates might never be admitted. But on the other hand, if from any cause\r\nthe population of one of the smaller States should suddenly decrease,\r\nmight not the resulting influx of new States prove dangerous?\r\n\r\nBut the real reason why the ordinance remained a dead letter was that,\r\nwhile it fixed the limits within which local governments might act,\r\nit left the creation of those governments wholly to the future. At\r\nVincennes, for example, the ordinance made no change in the political\r\nhabits of the people. \"The local government bowled along merrily under\r\nthis system. There was the greatest abundance of government, for the\r\nmore the United States neglected them the more authority their officials\r\nassumed.\" ¹ Nor could the ordinance operate until settlers became\r\nnumerous. It was partly, indeed, to hasten settlement that the Ordinance\r\nof 1785 for the survey and sale of the public lands was passed. ²\r\n\r\n¹ Jacob Piat Dunn, Jr., Indiana: A Redemption from Slavery, 1888.\r\n\r\n² Although the machinery was set in motion, by the appointment of men\r\nand the beginning of work, it was not until 1789 that the survey of the\r\nfirst seven ranges of townships was completed and the land offered for\r\nsale.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime efforts were being made by Congress to improve the\r\nunsatisfactory ordinance for the government of the West. Committees were\r\nappointed, reports were made, and at intervals of weeks or months the\r\nsubject was considered. Some amendments were actually adopted, but\r\nCongress, notoriously inefficient, hesitated to undertake a fundamental\r\nrevision of the ordinance. Then, suddenly, in July, 1787, after a brief\r\nperiod of adjournment, Congress took up this subject and within a week\r\nadopted the now famous Ordinance of 1787.\r\n\r\nThe stimulus which aroused Congress to activity seems to have come from\r\nthe Ohio Company. From the very beginning of the public domain there\r\nwas a strong sentiment in favor of using western land for settlement by\r\nRevolutionary soldiers. Some of these lands had been offered as bounties\r\nto encourage enlistment, and after the war the project of soldiers'\r\nsettlement in the West was vigorously agitated. The Ohio Company of\r\nAssociates was made up of veterans of the Revolution, who were looking\r\nfor homes in the West, and of other persons who were willing to support\r\na worthy cause by a subscription which might turn out to be a good\r\ninvestment. The company wished to buy land in the West, and Congress had\r\nland which it wished to sell. Under such circumstances it was easy to\r\nstrike a bargain. The land, as we have seen, was roughly estimated at\r\none dollar an acre; but, as the company wished to purchase a million\r\nacres, it demanded and obtained wholesale rates of two-thirds of the\r\nusual price. It also obtained the privilege of paying at least a portion\r\nin certificates of Revolutionary indebtedness, some of which were worth\r\nabout twelve and a half cents on the dollar. Only a little calculation\r\nis required to show that a large quantity of land was therefore sold at\r\nabout eight or nine cents an acre. It was in connection with this land\r\nsale that the Ordinance of 1787 was adopted.\r\n\r\nThe promoter of this enterprise undertaken by the Ohio Company was\r\nManasseh Cutler of Ipswich, Massachusetts, a clergyman by profession who\r\nhad served as a chaplain in the Revolutionary War. But his interests and\r\nactivities extended far beyond the bounds of his profession. When the\r\npeople of his parish were without proper medical advice he applied\r\nhimself to the study and practice of medicine. At about the same time\r\nhe took up the study of botany, and because of his describing several\r\nhundred species of plants he is regarded as the pioneer botanist of New\r\nEngland. His next interest seems to have grown out of his Revolutionary\r\nassociations, for it centered in this project for settlement of the\r\nWest, and he was appointed the agent of the Ohio Company. It was in this\r\ncapacity that he had come to New York and made the bargain with Congress\r\nwhich has just been described. Cutler must have been a good lobbyist,\r\nfor Congress was not an efficient body, and unremitting labor, as well\r\nas diplomacy, was required for so large and important a matter. Two\r\nthings indicate his method of procedure. In the first place he found\r\nit politic to drop his own candidate for the governorship of the new\r\nterritory and to endorse General Arthur St. Clair, then President of\r\nCongress. And in the next place he accepted the suggestion of Colonel\r\nWilliam Duer for the formation of another company, known as the Scioto\r\nAssociates, to purchase five million acres of land on similar terms,\r\n\"but that it should be kept a profound secret.\" It was not an accident\r\nthat Colonel Duer was Secretary of the Board of the Treasury through\r\nwhom these purchases were made, nor that associated with him in this\r\nspeculation were \"a number of the principal characters in the city.\"\r\nThese land deals were completed afterwards, but there is little doubt\r\nthat there was a direct connection between them and the adoption of the\r\nordinance of government.\r\n\r\nThe Ordinance of 1787 was so successful in its working and its renown\r\nbecame so great that claims of authorship, even for separate articles,\r\nhave been filed in the name of almost every person who had the slightest\r\nexcuse for being considered. Thousands of pages have been written in\r\neulogy and in dispute, to the helpful clearing up of some points and to\r\nthe obscuring of others. But the authorship of this or of that clause is\r\nof much less importance than the scope of the document as a working plan\r\nof government. As such the Ordinance of 1787 owes much to Jefferson's\r\nOrdinance of 1784. Under the new ordinance a governor and three judges\r\nwere to be appointed who, along with their other functions, were to\r\nselect such laws as they thought best from the statute books of all the\r\nStates. The second stage in self-government would be reached when the\r\npopulation contained five thousand free men of age; then the people were\r\nto have a representative legislature with the usual privilege of\r\nmaking their own laws. Provision was made for dividing the whole region\r\nnorthwest of the Ohio River into three or four or five districts and the\r\nfinal stage of government was reached when any one of these districts\r\nhad sixty thousand free inhabitants, for it might then establish its own\r\nconstitution and government and be admitted into the Union on an equal\r\nfooting with the original States.\r\n\r\nThe last-named provision for admission into the Union, being in the\r\nnature of a promise for the future, was not included in the body of\r\nthe document providing for the government, but was contained in certain\r\n\"articles of compact, between the original States and the people and\r\nStates in the said territory, [which should] forever remain unalterable,\r\nunless by common consent.\" These articles of compact were in general\r\nsimilar to the bills of rights in State Constitutions; but one of them\r\nfound no parallel in any State Constitution. Article VI reads:\r\n\"There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said\r\nterritory, otherwise than in the punishment of crimes, whereof the party\r\nshall have been duly convicted.\" This has been hailed as a farsighted,\r\nhumanitarian measure, and it is quite true that many of the leading men,\r\nin the South as well as in the North, were looking forward to the time\r\nwhen slavery would be abolished. But the motives predominating at the\r\ntime were probably more nearly represented by Grayson, who wrote to\r\nJames Monroe, three weeks after the ordinance was passed: \"The clause\r\nrespecting slavery was agreed to by the southern members for the purpose\r\nof preventing tobacco and indigo from being made on the northwest side\r\nof the Ohio, as well as for several other political reasons.\"\r\n\r\nIt is over one hundred and forty years since the Ordinance of 1787 was\r\nadopted, during which period more than thirty territories of the United\r\nStates have been organized, and there has never been a time when one or\r\nmore territories were not under Congressional supervision, so that the\r\nprocess of legislative control has been continuous. Changes have been\r\nmade from time to time in order to adapt the territorial government to\r\nchanged conditions, but for fifty years the Ordinance of 1787 actually\r\nremained in operation, and even twenty years later it was specifically\r\nreferred to by statute. The principles of territorial government today\r\nare identical with those of 1787, and those principles comprise the\r\nlargest measure of local self-government compatible with national\r\ncontrol, a gradual extension of self-government to the people of a\r\nterritory, and finally complete statehood and admission into the Union\r\non a footing of equality with the other States.\r\n\r\nIn 1825, when the military occupation of Oregon was suggested in\r\nCongress, Senator Dickerson of New Jersey objected, saying, \"We have not\r\nadopted a system of colonization and it is to be hoped we never shall.\"\r\nYet that is just what America has always had. Not only were the first\r\nsettlers on the Atlantic coast colonists from Europe; but the men who\r\nwent to the frontier were also colonists from the Atlantic seaboard. And\r\nthe men who settled the States in the West were colonists from the older\r\ncommunities. The Americans had so recently asserted their independence\r\nthat they regarded the name of colony as not merely indicating\r\ndependence but as implying something of inferiority and even of\r\nreproach. And when the American colonial system was being formulated in\r\n1783-87 the word \"Colony\" was not used. The country under consideration\r\nwas the region west of the Alleghany Mountains and in particular the\r\nterritory north and west of the Ohio River and, being so referred to in\r\nthe documents, the word \"Territory\" became the term applied to all the\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\nThe Northwest Territory increased so rapidly in population that in 1800\r\nit was divided into two districts, and in 1802 the eastern part was\r\nadmitted into the Union as the State of Ohio. The rest of the territory\r\nwas divided in 1805 and again in 1809; Indiana was admitted as a State\r\nin 1816 and Illinois in 1818. So the process has gone on. There were\r\nthirteen original States and six more have become members of the Union\r\nwithout having been through the status of territories, making nineteen\r\nin all; while twenty-nine States have developed from the colonial\r\nstage. The incorporation of the colonies into the Union is not merely a\r\npolitical fact; the inhabitants of the colonies become an integral part\r\nof the parent nation and in turn become the progenitors of new colonies.\r\nIf such a process be long continued, the colonies will eventually\r\noutnumber the parent States, and the colonists will outnumber the\r\ncitizens of the original States and will themselves become the nation.\r\nSuch has been the history of the United States and its people. By 1850,\r\nindeed, one-half of the population of the United States was living\r\nwest of the Alleghany Mountains, and at the present time approximately\r\nseventy per cent are to be found in the West.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the Ordinance of 1787 was hardly overstated by Webster\r\nin his famous debate with Hayne when he said: \"We are accustomed ...\r\nto praise the lawgivers of antiquity; we help to perpetuate the fame of\r\nSolon and Lycurgus; but I doubt whether one single law of any lawgiver,\r\nancient or modern, has produced effects of more distinct, marked and\r\nlasting character than the Ordinance of 1787.\" While improved means\r\nof communication and many other material ties have served to hold the\r\nStates of the Union together, the political bond was supplied by the\r\nOrdinance of 1787, which inaugurated the American colonial system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V DARKNESS BEFORE DAWN\r\n\r\nJohn Fiske summed up the prevailing impression of the government of\r\nthe Confederation in the title to his volume, The Critical Period of\r\nAmerican History. \"The period of five years,\" says Fiske, \"following\r\nthe peace of 1783 was the most critical moment in all the history of the\r\nAmerican people. The dangers from which we were saved in 1788 were even\r\ngreater than were the dangers from which we were saved in 1865.\" Perhaps\r\nthe plight of the Confederation was not so desperate as he would have\r\nus believe, but it was desperate enough. Two incidents occurring between\r\nthe signing of the preliminary terms of peace and the definitive\r\ntreaty reveal the danger in which the country stood. The main body\r\nof continental troops made up of militiamen and short-term\r\nvolunteers--always prone to mutinous conduct--was collected at Newburg\r\non the Hudson, watching the British in New York. Word might come at any\r\nday that the treaty had been signed, and the army did not wish to be\r\ndisbanded until certain matters had been settled--primarily the question\r\nof their pay. The officers had been promised half-pay for life, but\r\nnothing definite had been done toward carrying out the promise. The\r\nsoldiers had no such hope to encourage them, and their pay was sadly in\r\narrears. In December, 1782, the officers at Newburg drew up an address\r\nin behalf of themselves and their men and sent it to Congress. Therein\r\nthey made the threat, thinly veiled, of taking matters into their own\r\nhands unless their grievances were redressed.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to suppose that back of this movement--or at least in\r\nsympathy with it--were some of the strongest men in civil as in military\r\nlife, who, while not fomenting insurrection, were willing to bring\r\npressure to bear on Congress and the States. Congress was unable\r\nor unwilling to act, and in March, 1783, a second paper, this time\r\nanonymous, was circulated urging the men not to disband until the\r\nquestion of pay had been settled and recommending a meeting of officers\r\non the following day. If Washington's influence was not counted upon,\r\nit was at least hoped that he would not interfere; but as soon as he\r\nlearned of what had been done he issued general orders calling for\r\na meeting of officers on a later day, thus superseding the\r\nirregular meeting that had been suggested. On the day appointed the\r\nCommander-in-Chief appeared and spoke with so much warmth and feeling\r\nthat his \"little address ... drew tears from many of the officers.\" He\r\ninveighed against the unsigned paper and against the methods that were\r\ntalked of, for they would mean the disgrace of the army, and he appealed\r\nto the patriotism of the officers, promising his best efforts in\r\ntheir behalf. The effect was so strong that, when Washington withdrew,\r\nresolutions were adopted unanimously expressing their loyalty and their\r\nfaith in the justice of Congress and denouncing the anonymous circular.\r\n\r\nThe general apprehension was not diminished by another incident in June.\r\nSome eighty troops of the Pennsylvania line in camp at Lancaster marched\r\nto Philadelphia and drew up before the State House, where Congress was\r\nsitting. Their purpose was to demand better treatment and the payment of\r\nwhat was owed to them. So far it was an orderly demonstration, although\r\nnot in keeping with military regulations; in fact the men had broken\r\naway from camp under the lead of noncommissioned officers. But when\r\nthey had been stimulated by drink the disorder became serious. The\r\nhumiliating feature of the situation was that Congress could do nothing,\r\neven in self-protection. They appealed to the Pennsylvania authorities\r\nand, when assistance was refused, the members of Congress in alarm fled\r\nin the night and three days later gathered in the college building in\r\nPrinceton.\r\n\r\nCongress became the butt of many jokes, but men could not hide the\r\nchagrin they felt that their Government was so weak. The feeling\r\ndeepened into shame when the helplessness of Congress was displayed\r\nbefore the world. Weeks and even months passed before a quorum could be\r\nobtained to ratify the treaty recognizing the independence of the United\r\nStates and establishing peace. Even after the treaty was supposed to\r\nbe in force the States disregarded its provisions and Congress could do\r\nnothing more than utter ineffective protests. But, most humiliating of\r\nall, the British maintained their military posts within the northwestern\r\nterritory ceded to the United States, and Congress could only request\r\nthem to retire. The Americans' pride was hurt and their pockets were\r\ntouched as well, for an important issue at stake was the control of the\r\nlucrative fur trade. So resentment grew into anger; but the British held\r\non, and the United States was powerless to make them withdraw. To make\r\nmatters worse, the Confederation, for want of power to levy taxes, was\r\nfacing bankruptcy, and Congress was unable to devise ways and means to\r\navert a crisis.\r\n\r\nThe Second Continental Congress had come into existence in 1775. It was\r\nmade up of delegations from the various colonies, appointed in more or\r\nless irregular ways, and had no more authority than it might assume and\r\nthe various colonies were willing to concede; yet it was the central\r\nbody under which the Revolution had been inaugurated and carried through\r\nto a successful conclusion. Had this Congress grappled firmly with the\r\nfinancial problem and forced through a system of direct taxation, the\r\nsubsequent woes of the Confederation might have been mitigated\r\nand perhaps averted. In their enthusiasm over the Declaration of\r\nIndependence the people--by whom is meant the articulate class\r\nconsisting largely of the governing and commercial elements--would\r\nprobably have accepted such a usurpation of authority. But with their\r\nlack of experience it is not surprising that the delegates to Congress\r\ndid not appreciate the necessity of such radical action and so were\r\nunwilling to take the responsibility for it. They counted upon the\r\ngoodwill and support of their constituents, which simmered down to a\r\nreliance upon voluntary grants from the States in response to appeals\r\nfrom Congress. These desultory grants proved to be so unsatisfactory\r\nthat, in 1781, even before the Articles of Confederation had been\r\nratified, Congress asked for a grant of additional power to levy a duty\r\nof five per cent ad valorem upon all goods imported into the United\r\nStates, the revenue from which was to be applied to the discharge of\r\nthe principal and interest on debts \"contracted ... for supporting\r\nthe present war.\" Twelve States agreed, but Rhode Island, after some\r\nhesitation, finally rejected the measure in November, 1782.\r\n\r\nThe Articles of Confederation authorized a system of requisitions\r\napportioned among the \"several States in proportion to the value of all\r\nland within each State.\" But, as there was no power vested in Congress\r\nto force the States to comply, the situation was in no way improved when\r\nthe Articles were ratified and put into operation. In fact, matters grew\r\nworse as Congress itself steadily lost ground in popular estimation,\r\nuntil it had become little better than a laughing-stock, and with the\r\nending of the war its requests were more honored in the breach than in\r\nthe observance. In 1782 Congress asked for $8,000,000 and the following\r\nyear for $2,000,000 more, but by the end of 1783 less than $1,500,000\r\nhad been paid in.\r\n\r\nIn the same year, 1783, Congress made another attempt to remedy the\r\nfinancial situation by proposing the so-called Revenue Amendment,\r\naccording to which a specific duty was to be laid upon certain articles\r\nand a general duty of five per cent ad valorem upon all other goods,\r\nto be in operation for twenty-five years. In addition to this it was\r\nproposed that for the same period of time $1,500,000 annually should\r\nbe raised by requisitions, and the definite amount for each State was\r\nspecified until \"the rule of the Confederation\" could be carried into\r\npractice. It was then proposed that the article providing for the\r\nproportion of requisitions should be changed so as to be based not upon\r\nland values but upon population, in estimating which slaves should be\r\ncounted at three-fifths of their number. In the course of three years\r\nthereafter only two States accepted the proposals in full, seven agreed\r\nto them in part, and four failed to act at all. Congress in despair then\r\nmade a further representation to the States upon the critical condition\r\nof the finances and accompanied this with an urgent appeal, which\r\nresulted in all the States except New York agreeing to the proposed\r\nimpost. But the refusal of one State was sufficient to block the\r\nwhole measure, and there was no further hope for a treasury that was\r\npractically bankrupt. In five years Congress had received less than two\r\nand one-half million dollars from requisitions, and for the fourteen\r\nmonths ending January 1, 1786, the income was at the rate of less\r\nthan $375,000 a year, which was not enough, as a committee of Congress\r\nreported, \"for the bare maintenance of the Federal Government on the\r\nmost economical establishment and in time of profound peace.\" In fact,\r\nthe income was not sufficient even to meet the interest on the foreign\r\ndebt.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of other means of obtaining funds Congress had resorted\r\nearly to the unfortunate expedient of issuing paper money based solely\r\non the good faith of the States to redeem it. This fiat money held its\r\nvalue for some little time; then it began to shrink and, once started\r\non the downward path, its fall was rapid. Congress tried to meet the\r\nemergency by issuing paper in increasing quantities until the inevitable\r\nhappened: the paper money ceased to have any value and practically\r\ndisappeared from circulation. Jefferson said that by the end of 1781\r\none thousand dollars of Continental scrip was worth about one dollar in\r\nspecie.\r\n\r\nThe States had already issued paper money of their own, and their\r\nexperience ought to have taught them a lesson, but with the coming of\r\nhard times after the war, they once more proposed by issuing paper to\r\nrelieve the \"scarcity of money\" which was commonly supposed to be one\r\nof the principal evils of the day. In 1785 and 1786 paper money parties\r\nappeared in almost all the States. In some of these the conservative\r\nelement was strong enough to prevent action, but in others the movement\r\nhad to run its fatal course. The futility of what they were doing should\r\nhave been revealed to all concerned by proposals seriously made that the\r\npaper money which was issued should depreciate at a regular rate each\r\nyear until it should finally disappear.\r\n\r\nThe experience of Rhode Island is not to be regarded as typical of\r\nwhat was happening throughout the country but is, indeed, rather to be\r\nconsidered as exceptional. Yet it attracted widespread attention and\r\nrevealed to anxious observers the dangers to which the country was\r\nsubject if the existing condition of affairs were allowed to continue.\r\nThe machinery of the State Government was captured by the paper-money\r\nparty in the spring election of 1786. The results were disappointing to\r\nthe adherents of the paper-money cause, for when the money was issued\r\ndepreciation began at once, and those who tried to pay their bills\r\ndiscovered that a heavy discount was demanded. In response to indignant\r\ndemands the legislature of Rhode Island passed an act to force the\r\nacceptance of paper money under penalty and thereupon tradesmen refused\r\nto make any sales at all--some closed their shops, and others tried to\r\ncarry on business by exchange of wares. The farmers then retaliated by\r\nrefusing to sell their produce to the shopkeepers, and general confusion\r\nand acute distress followed. It was mainly a quarrel between the farmers\r\nand the merchants, but it easily grew into a division between town and\r\ncountry, and there followed a whole series of town meetings and county\r\nconventions. The old line of cleavage was fairly well represented by the\r\nexcommunication of a member of St. John's Episcopal Church of Providence\r\nfor tendering bank notes, and the expulsion of a member of the Society\r\nof the Cincinnati for a similar cause.\r\n\r\nThe contest culminated in the case of Trevett vs. Weeden, 1786, which is\r\nmemorable in the judicial annals of the United States. The legislature,\r\nnot being satisfied with ordinary methods of enforcement, had provided\r\nfor the summary trial of offenders without a jury before a court whose\r\njudges were removable by the Assembly and were therefore supposedly\r\nsubservient to its wishes. In the case in question the Superior Court\r\nboldly declared the enforcing act to be unconstitutional, and for their\r\ncontumacious behavior the judges were summoned before the legislature.\r\nThey escaped punishment, but only one of them was re¨elected to office.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile disorders of a more serious sort, which startled the whole\r\ncountry, occurred in Massachusetts. It is doubtful if a satisfactory\r\nexplanation ever will be found, at least one which will be universally\r\naccepted, as to the causes and origin of Shays' Rebellion in 1786. Some\r\nhistorians maintain that the uprising resulted primarily from a scarcity\r\nof money, from a shortage in the circulating medium; that, while the\r\neastern counties were keeping up their foreign trade sufficiently at\r\nleast to bring in enough metallic currency to relieve the stringency and\r\ncould also use various forms of credit, the western counties had no\r\nsuch remedy. Others are inclined to think that the difficulties of the\r\nfarmers in western Massachusetts were caused largely by the return to\r\nnormal conditions after the extraordinarily good times between 1776 and\r\n1780, and that it was the discomfort attending the process that drove\r\nthem to revolt. Another explanation reminds one of present-day charges\r\nagainst undue influence of high financial circles, when it is\r\ninsinuated and even directly charged that the rebellion was fostered\r\nby conservative interests who were trying to create a public opinion in\r\nfavor of a more strongly organized government.\r\n\r\nWhatever other causes there may have been, the immediate source of\r\ntrouble was the enforced payment of indebtedness, which to a large\r\nextent had been allowed to remain in abeyance during the war. This\r\npostponement of settlement had not been merely for humanitarian reasons;\r\nit would have been the height of folly to collect when the currency was\r\ngreatly depreciated. But conditions were supposed to have been restored\r\nto normal with the cessation of hostilities, and creditors were\r\ngenerally inclined to demand payment. These demands, coinciding with\r\nthe heavy taxes, drove the people of western Massachusetts into revolt.\r\nFeeling ran high against lawyers who prosecuted suits for creditors, and\r\nthis antagonism was easily transferred to the courts in which the suits\r\nwere brought. The rebellion in Massachusetts accordingly took the form\r\nof a demonstration against the courts. A paper was carried from town\r\nto town in the County of Worcester, in which the signers promised to\r\ndo their utmost \"to prevent the sitting of the Inferior Court of Common\r\nPleas for the county, or of any other court that should attempt to take\r\nproperty by distress.\"\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts Legislature adjourned in July, 1786, without remedying\r\nthe trouble and also without authorizing an issue of paper money which\r\nthe hard-pressed debtors were demanding. In the months following mobs\r\nprevented the courts from sitting in various towns. A special session of\r\nthe legislature was then called by the Governor but, when that special\r\nsession had adjourned on the 18th of November, it might just as well\r\nhave never met. It had attempted to remedy various grievances and had\r\nmade concessions to the malcontents, but it had also passed measures to\r\nstrengthen the hands of the Governor. This only seemed to inflame the\r\nrioters, and the disorders increased. After the lower courts a move\r\nwas made against the State Supreme Court, and plans were laid for a\r\nconcerted movement against the cities in the eastern part of the State.\r\nCivil war seemed imminent. The insurgents were led by Daniel Shays, an\r\nofficer in the army of the Revolution, and the party of law and order\r\nwas represented by Governor James Bowdoin, who raised some four thousand\r\ntroops and placed them under the command of General Benjamin Lincoln.\r\n\r\nThe time of year was unfortunate for the insurgents, especially as\r\nDecember was unusually cold and there was a heavy snowfall. Shays could\r\nnot provide stores and equipment and was unable to maintain discipline.\r\nA threatened attack on Cambridge came to naught for, when preparations\r\nwere made to protect the city, the rebels began a disorderly retreat,\r\nand in the intense cold and deep snow they suffered severely, and many\r\ndied from exposure. The center of interest then shifted to Springfield,\r\nwhere the insurgents were attempting to seize the United States arsenal.\r\nThe local militia had already repelled the first attacks, and\r\nthe appearance of General Lincoln with his troops completed the\r\ndemoralization of Shays' army. The insurgents retreated, but Lincoln\r\npursued relentlessly and broke them up into small bands, which then\r\nwandered about the country preying upon the unfortunate inhabitants.\r\nWhen spring came, most of them had been subdued or had taken refuge in\r\nthe neighboring States.\r\n\r\nShays' Rebellion was fairly easily suppressed, even though it required\r\nthe shedding of some blood. But it was the possibility of further\r\noutbreaks that destroyed men's peace of mind. There were similar\r\ndisturbances in other States; and there the Massachusetts insurgents\r\nfound sympathy, support, and finally a refuge. When the worst was over,\r\nand Governor Bowdoin applied to the neighboring States for help in\r\ncapturing the last of the refugees, Rhode Island and Vermont failed to\r\nrespond to the extent that might have been expected of them. The danger,\r\ntherefore, of the insurrection spreading was a cause of deep concern.\r\nThis feeling was increased by the impotence of Congress. The Government\r\nhad sufficient excuse for intervention after the attack upon the\r\nnational arsenal in Springfield. Congress, indeed, began to raise\r\ntroops but did not dare to admit its purpose and offered as a pretext\r\nan expedition against the Northwestern Indians. The rebellion was over\r\nbefore any assistance could be given. The inefficiency of Congress and\r\nits lack of influence were evident. Like the disorders in Rhode Island,\r\nShays' Rebellion in Massachusetts helped to bring about a reaction and\r\nstrengthened the conservative movement for reform.\r\n\r\nThese untoward happenings, however, were only symptoms: the causes\r\nof the trouble lay far deeper. This fact was recognized even in Rhode\r\nIsland, for at least one of the conventions had passed resolutions\r\ndeclaring that, in considering the condition of the whole country, what\r\nparticularly concerned them was the condition of trade. Paradoxical as\r\nit may seem, the trade and commerce of the country were already on the\r\nupward grade and prosperity was actually returning. But prosperity\r\nis usually a process of slow growth and is seldom recognized by the\r\ncommunity at large until it is well established. Farsighted men forecast\r\nthe coming of good times in advance of the rest of the community, and\r\nprosper accordingly. The majority of the people know that prosperity has\r\ncome only when it is unmistakably present, and some are not aware of it\r\nuntil it has begun to go. If that be true in our day, much more was it\r\ntrue in the eighteenth century, when means of communication were so poor\r\nthat it took days for a message to go from Boston to New York and\r\nweeks for news to get from Boston to Charleston. It was a period of\r\nadjustment, and as we look back after the event we can see that the\r\nAmerican people were adapting themselves with remarkable skill to the\r\nnew conditions. But that was not so evident to the men who were feeling\r\nthe pinch of hard times, and when all the attendant circumstances,\r\nsome of which have been described, are taken into account, it is not\r\nsurprising that commercial depression should be one of the strongest\r\ninfluences in, and the immediate occasion of, bringing men to the point\r\nof willingness to attempt some radical changes.\r\n\r\nThe fact needs to be reiterated that the people of the United States\r\nwere largely dependent upon agriculture and other forms of extractive\r\nindustry, and that markets for the disposal of their goods were an\r\nabsolute necessity. Some of the States, especially New England and\r\nthe Middle States, were interested in the carrying trade, but all were\r\nconcerned in obtaining markets. On account of jealousy interstate trade\r\ncontinued a precarious existence and by no means sufficed to dispose of\r\nthe surplus products, so that foreign markets were necessary. The people\r\nwere especially concerned for the establishment of the old trade with\r\nthe West India Islands, which had been the mainstay of their prosperity\r\nin colonial times; and after the British Government, in 1783, restricted\r\nthat trade to British vessels, many people in the United States were\r\nattributing hard times to British malignancy. The only action which\r\nseemed possible was to force Great Britain in particular, but other\r\nforeign countries as well, to make such trade agreements as the\r\nprosperity of the United States demanded. The only hope seemed to lie\r\nin a commercial policy of reprisal which would force other countries\r\nto open their markets to American goods. Retaliation was the dominating\r\nidea in the foreign policy of the time. So in 1784 Congress made a new\r\nrecommendation to the States, prefacing it with an assertion of the\r\nimportance of commerce, saying: \"The fortune of every Citizen is\r\ninterested in the success thereof; for it is the constant source of\r\nwealth and incentive to industry; and the value of our produce and our\r\nland must ever rise or fall in proportion to the prosperous or adverse\r\nstate of trade.\"\r\n\r\nAnd after declaring that Great Britain had \"adopted regulations\r\ndestructive of our commerce with her West India Islands,\" it was further\r\nasserted: \"Unless the United States in Congress assembled shall be\r\nvested with powers competent to the protection of commerce, they can\r\nnever command reciprocal advantages in trade.\" It was therefore\r\nproposed to give to Congress for fifteen years the power to prohibit the\r\nimportation or exportation of goods at American ports except in vessels\r\nowned by the people of the United States or by the subjects of foreign\r\ngovernments having treaties of commerce with the United States. This\r\nwas simply a request for authorization to adopt navigation acts. But the\r\nindividual States were too much concerned with their own interests and\r\ndid not or would not appreciate the rights of the other States or the\r\ninterests of the Union as a whole. And so the commercial amendment of\r\n1784 suffered the fate of all other amendments proposed to the Articles\r\nof Confederation. In fact only two States accepted it.\r\n\r\nIt usually happens that some minor occurrence, almost unnoticed at the\r\ntime, leads directly to the most important consequences. And an incident\r\nin domestic affairs started the chain of events in the United States\r\nthat ended in the reform of the Federal Government. The rivalry and\r\njealousy among the States had brought matters to such a pass that either\r\nCongress must be vested with adequate powers or the Confederation must\r\ncollapse. But the Articles of Confederation provided no remedy, and it\r\nhad been found that amendments to that instrument could not be obtained.\r\nIt was necessary, therefore, to proceed in some extra-legal fashion.\r\nThe Articles of Confederation specifically forbade treaties or alliances\r\nbetween the States unless approved by Congress. Yet Virginia and\r\nMaryland, in 1785, had come to a working agreement regarding the use\r\nof the Potomac River, which was the boundary line between them.\r\nCommissioners representing both parties had met at Alexandria and soon\r\nadjourned to Mount Vernon, where they not only reached an amicable\r\nsettlement of the immediate questions before them but also discussed the\r\nlarger subjects of duties and commercial matters in general. When\r\nthe Maryland legislature came to act on the report, it proposed that\r\nPennsylvania and Delaware should be invited to join with them in\r\nformulating a common commercial policy. Virginia then went one step\r\nfarther and invited all the other States to send commissioners to a\r\ngeneral trade convention and later announced Annapolis as the place of\r\nmeeting and set the time for September, 1786.\r\n\r\nThis action was unconstitutional and was so recognized, for James\r\nMadison notes that \"from the Legislative Journals of Virginia it\r\nappears, that a vote to apply for a sanction of Congress was followed\r\nby a vote against a communication of the Compact to Congress,\" and he\r\nmentions other similar violations of the central authority. That this\r\ndid not attract more attention was probably due to the public interest\r\nbeing absorbed just at that time by the paper money agitation. Then,\r\ntoo, the men concerned seem to have been willing to avoid publicity.\r\nTheir purposes are well brought out in a letter of Monsieur Louis Otto,\r\nFrench Chargé d'Affaires, written on October 10, 1786, to the Comte de\r\nVergennes, Minister for Foreign Affairs, though their motives may be\r\nsomewhat misinterpreted.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are no nobles in America, there is a class of men\r\ndenominated \"gentlemen,\" who, by reason of their wealth, their talents,\r\ntheir education, their families, or the offices they hold, aspire to a\r\npreeminence which the people refuse to grant them; and, although many of\r\nthese men have betrayed the interests of their order to gain popularity,\r\nthere reigns among them a connection so much the more intimate as they\r\nalmost all of them dread the efforts of the people to despoil them of\r\ntheir possessions, and, moreover, they are creditors, and therefore\r\ninterested in strengthening the government, and watching over the\r\nexecution of the laws.\r\n\r\nThese men generally pay very heavy taxes, while the small proprietors\r\nescape the vigilance of the collectors. The majority of them being\r\nmerchants, it is for their interest to establish the credit of the\r\nUnited States in Europe on a solid foundation by the exact payment of\r\ndebts, and to grant to congress powers extensive enough to compel the\r\npeople to contribute for this purpose. The attempt, my lord, has been\r\nvain, by pamphlets and other publications, to spread notions of justice\r\nand integrity, and to deprive the people of a freedom which they have so\r\nmisused. By proposing a new organization of the federal government all\r\nminds would have been revolted; circumstances ruinous to the commerce of\r\nAmerica have happily arisen to furnish the reformers with a pretext for\r\nintroducing innovations.\r\n\r\nThey represented to the people that the American name had become\r\nopprobrious among all the nations of Europe; that the flag of the United\r\nStates was everywhere exposed to insults and annoyance; the husbandman,\r\nno longer able to export his produce freely, would soon be reduced to\r\nwant; it was high time to retaliate, and to convince foreign powers that\r\nthe United States would not with impunity suffer such a violation of the\r\nfreedom of trade, but that strong measures could be taken only with\r\nthe consent of the thirteen states, and that congress, not having the\r\nnecessary powers, it was essential to form a general assembly instructed\r\nto present to congress the plan for its adoption, and to point out the\r\nmeans of carrying it into execution.\r\n\r\nThe people, generally discontented with the obstacles in the way of\r\ncommerce, and scarcely suspecting the secret motives of their opponents,\r\nardently embraced this measure, and appointed commissioners, who were to\r\nassemble at Annapolis in the beginning of September.\r\n\r\nThe authors of this proposition had no hope, nor even desire, to see the\r\nsuccess of this assembly of commissioners, which was only intended\r\nto prepare a question much more important than that of commerce. The\r\nmeasures were so well taken that at the end of September no more than\r\nfive states were represented at Annapolis, and the commissioners from\r\nthe northern states tarried several days at New York in order to retard\r\ntheir arrival.\r\n\r\nThe states which assembled, after having waited nearly three weeks,\r\nseparated under the pretext that they were not in sufficient numbers to\r\nenter on business, and, to justify this dissolution, they addressed to\r\nthe different legislatures and to congress a report, the translation of\r\nwhich I have the honor to enclose to you. ¹\r\n\r\n¹ Quoted by Bancroft, History of the Formation of the Constitution, vol.\r\nii, Appendix, pp. 399-400.\r\n\r\nAmong these \"men denominated 'gentlemen'\" to whom the French Chargé\r\nd'Affaires alludes, was James Madison of Virginia. He was one of the\r\nyounger men, unfitted by temperament and physique to be a soldier, who\r\nyet had found his opportunity in the Revolution. Graduating in 1771\r\nfrom Princeton, where tradition tells of the part he took in patriotic\r\ndemonstrations on the campus--characteristic of students then as now--he\r\nhad thrown himself heart and soul into the American cause. He was a\r\nmember of the convention to frame the first State Constitution for\r\nVirginia in 1776, and from that time on, because of his ability, he was\r\nan important figure in the political history of his State and of his\r\ncountry. He was largely responsible for bringing about the conference\r\nbetween Virginia and Maryland and for the subsequent steps resulting\r\nin the trade convention at Annapolis. And yet Madison seldom took a\r\nconspicuous part, preferring to remain in the background and to\r\nallow others to appear as the leaders. When the Annapolis Convention\r\nassembled, for example, he suffered Alexander Hamilton of New York to\r\nplay the leading rôle.\r\n\r\nHamilton was then approaching thirty years of age and was one of the\r\nablest men in the United States. Though his best work was done in\r\nlater years, when he proved himself to be perhaps the most brilliant\r\nof American statesmen, with an extraordinary genius for administrative\r\norganization, the part that he took in the affairs of this period was\r\nimportant. He was small and slight in person but with an expressive\r\nface, fair complexion, and cheeks of \"almost feminine rosiness.\" The\r\nusual aspect of his countenance was thoughtful and even severe, but in\r\nconversation his face lighted up with a remarkably attractive smile. He\r\ncarried himself erectly and with dignity, so that in spite of his small\r\nfigure, when he entered a room \"it was apparent, from the respectful\r\nattention of the company, that he was a distinguished person.\" A\r\ncontemporary, speaking of the opposite and almost irreconcilable traits\r\nof Hamilton's character, pronounced a bust of him as giving a complete\r\nexposition of his character: \"Draw a handkerchief around the mouth of\r\nthe bust, and the remnant of the countenance represents fortitude and\r\nintrepidity such as we have often seen in the plates of Roman heroes.\r\nVeil in the same manner the face and leave the mouth and chin only\r\ndiscernible, and all this fortitude melts and vanishes into almost\r\nfeminine softness.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton was a leading spirit in the Annapolis Trade Convention and\r\nwrote the report that it adopted. Whether or not there is any truth in\r\nthe assertion of the French chargé that Hamilton and others thought\r\nit advisable to disguise their purposes, there is no doubt that the\r\nAnnapolis Convention was an all-important step in the progress of\r\nreform, and its recommendation was the direct occasion of the calling of\r\nthe great convention that framed the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe recommendation of the Annapolis delegates was in the form of a\r\nreport to the legislatures of their respective States, in which they\r\nreferred to the defects in the Federal Government and called for \"a\r\nconvention of deputies from the different states for the special purpose\r\nof entering into this investigation and digesting a Plan for supplying\r\nsuch defects.\" Philadelphia was suggested as the place of meeting, and\r\nthe time was fixed for the second Monday in May of the next year.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the States acted promptly upon this recommendation and in\r\nFebruary, 1787, Congress adopted a resolution accepting the proposal and\r\ncalling the convention \"for the sole and express purpose of revising\r\nthe Articles of Confederation and reporting ... such alterations ... as\r\nshall ... render the Federal Constitution adequate to the exigencies of\r\nGovernment and the preservation of the Union.\" Before the time fixed for\r\nthe meeting of the Philadelphia Convention, or shortly after that\r\ndate, all the States had appointed deputies with the exception of New\r\nHampshire and Rhode Island. New Hampshire was favorably disposed toward\r\nthe meeting but, owing to local conditions, failed to act before the\r\nConvention was well under way. Delegates, however, arrived in time to\r\nshare in some of the most important proceedings. Rhode Island alone\r\nrefused to take part, although a letter signed by some of the prominent\r\nmen was sent to the Convention pledging their support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI THE FEDERAL CONVENTION\r\n\r\nThe body of delegates which met in Philadelphia in 1787 was the\r\nmost important convention that ever sat in the United States. The\r\nConfederation was a failure, and if the new nation was to be justified\r\nin the eyes of the world, it must show itself capable of effective\r\nunion. The members of the Convention realized the significance of the\r\ntask before them, which was, as Madison said, \"now to decide forever\r\nthe fate of Republican government.\" Gouverneur Morris, with unwonted\r\nseriousness, declared: \"The whole human race will be affected by the\r\nproceedings of this Convention.\" James Wilson spoke with equal gravity:\r\n\"After the lapse of six thousand years since the creation of the world\r\nAmerica now presents the first instance of a people assembled to weigh\r\ndeliberately and calmly and to decide leisurely and peaceably upon\r\nthe form of government by which they will bind themselves and their\r\nposterity.\"\r\n\r\nNot all the men to whom this undertaking was entrusted, and who were\r\ntaking themselves and their work so seriously, could pretend to social\r\ndistinction, but practically all belonged to the upper ruling class. At\r\nthe Indian Queen, a tavern on Fourth Street between Market and Chestnut,\r\nsome of the delegates had a hall in which they lived by themselves.\r\nThe meetings of the Convention were held in an upper room of the State\r\nHouse. The sessions were secret; sentries were placed at the door to\r\nkeep away all intruders; and the pavement of the street in front of\r\nthe building was covered with loose earth so that the noises of passing\r\ntraffic should not disturb this august assembly. It is not surprising\r\nthat a tradition grew up about the Federal Convention which hedged it\r\nround with a sort of awe and reverence. Even Thomas Jefferson referred\r\nto it as \"an assembly of demigods.\" If we can get away from the glamour\r\nwhich has been spread over the work of the Fathers of the Constitution\r\nand understand that they were human beings, even as we are, and\r\ninfluenced by the same motives as other men, it may be possible to\r\nobtain a more faithful impression of what actually took place.\r\n\r\nSince representation in the Convention was to be by States, just as it\r\nhad been in the Continental Congress, the presence of delegations from\r\na majority of the States was necessary for organization. It is a\r\ncommentary upon the times, upon the difficulties of travel, and upon the\r\nleisurely habits of the people, that the meeting which had been called\r\nfor the 14th of May could not begin its work for over ten days. The 25th\r\nof May was stormy, and only twenty-nine delegates were on hand when\r\nthe Convention organized. The slender attendance can only partially be\r\nattributed to the weather, for in the following three months and a half\r\nof the Convention, at which fifty-five members were present at one time\r\nor another, the average attendance was only slightly larger than that\r\nof the first day. In such a small body personality counted for much,\r\nin ways that the historian can only surmise. Many compromises of\r\nconflicting interests were reached by informal discussion outside of\r\nthe formal sessions. In these small gatherings individual character was\r\noften as decisive as weighty argument.\r\n\r\nGeorge Washington was unanimously chosen as the presiding officer of the\r\nConvention. He sat on a raised platform; in a large, carved, high-backed\r\nchair, from which his commanding figure and dignified bearing exerted\r\na potent influence on the assembly, an influence enhanced by the formal\r\ncourtesy and stately intercourse of the times. Washington was the great\r\nman of his day and the members not only respected and admired him; some\r\nof them were actually afraid of him. When he rose to his feet he was\r\nalmost the Commander-in-Chief again. There is evidence to show that\r\nhis support or disapproval was at times a decisive factor in the\r\ndeliberations of the Convention.\r\n\r\nVirginia, which had taken a conspicuous part in the calling of the\r\nConvention, was looked to for leadership in the work that was to be\r\ndone. James Madison, next to Washington the most important member of\r\nthe Virginia delegation, was the very opposite of Washington in many\r\nrespects--small and slight in stature, inconspicuous in dress as in\r\nfigure, modest and retiring, but with a quick, active mind and wide\r\nknowledge obtained both from experience in public affairs and from\r\nextensive reading. Washington was the man of action; Madison, the\r\nscholar in politics. Madison was the younger by nearly twenty years,\r\nbut Washington admired him greatly and gave him the support of his\r\ninfluence--a matter of no little consequence, for Madison was the\r\nleading expert worker of the Convention in the business of framing the\r\nConstitution. Governor Edmund Randolph, with his tall figure, handsome\r\nface, and dignified manner, made an excellent impression in the position\r\naccorded to him of nominal leader of the Virginia delegation. Among\r\nothers from the same State who should be noticed were the famous\r\nlawyers, George Wythe and George Mason.\r\n\r\nAmong the deputies from Pennsylvania the foremost was James Wilson, the\r\n\"Caledonian,\" who probably stood next in importance in the convention to\r\nMadison and Washington. He had come to America as a young man just\r\nwhen the troubles with England were beginning and by sheer ability had\r\nattained a position of prominence. Several times a member of Congress, a\r\nsigner of the Declaration of Independence, he was now regarded as one of\r\nthe ablest lawyers in the United States. A more brilliant member of\r\nthe Pennsylvania delegation, and one of the most brilliant of the\r\nConvention, was Gouverneur Morris, who shone by his cleverness and quick\r\nwit as well as by his wonderful command of language. But Morris was\r\nadmired more than he was trusted; and, while he supported the efforts\r\nfor a strong government, his support was not always as great a help as\r\nmight have been expected. A crippled arm and a wooden leg might detract\r\nfrom his personal appearance, but they could not subdue his spirit and\r\naudacity. ¹\r\n\r\n¹ There is a story which illustrates admirably the audacity of Morris\r\nand the austere dignity of Washington. The story runs that Morris\r\nand several members of the Cabinet were spending an evening at the\r\nPresident's house in Philadelphia, where they were discussing the\r\nabsorbing question of the hour, whatever it may have been. \"The\r\nPresident,\" Morris is said to have related on the following day, \"was\r\nstanding with his arms behind him--his usual position--his back to the\r\nfire. I started up and spoke, stamping, as I walked up and down, with my\r\nwooden leg; and, as I was certain I had the best of the argument, as\r\nI finished I stalked up to the President, slapped him on the back, and\r\nsaid. 'Ain't I right, General?' The President did not speak, but the\r\nmajesty of the American people was before me. Oh, his look! How I wished\r\nthe floor would open and I could descend to the cellar! You know me,\"\r\ncontinued Mr. Morris, \"and you know my eye would never quail before\r\nany other mortal.\"--W. T. Read, Life and Correspondence of George Read\r\n(1870) p. 441.\r\n\r\nThere were other prominent members of the Pennsylvania delegation, but\r\nnone of them took an important part in the Convention, not even the aged\r\nBenjamin Franklin, President of the State. At the age of eighty-one his\r\npowers were failing, and he was so feeble that his colleague Wilson read\r\nhis speeches for him. His opinions were respected, but they do not seem\r\nto have carried much weight.\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy members of the Convention, though hardly in the first\r\nclass, were the handsome and charming Rufus King of Massachusetts,\r\none of the coming men of the country, and Nathaniel Gorham of the same\r\nState, who was President of Congress--a man of good sense rather than of\r\ngreat ability, but one whose reputation was high and whose presence was\r\na distinct asset to the Convention. Then, too, there were the delegates\r\nfrom South Carolina: John Rutledge, the orator, General Charles\r\nCotesworth Pinckney of Revolutionary fame, and his cousin, Charles\r\nPinckney. The last named took a conspicuous part in the proceedings in\r\nPhiladelphia but, so far as the outcome was concerned, left his mark on\r\nthe Constitution mainly in minor matters and details.\r\n\r\nThe men who have been named were nearly all supporters of the plan for\r\na centralized government. On the other side were William Paterson of New\r\nJersey, who had been Attorney-General of his State for eleven years\r\nand who was respected for his knowledge and ability; John Dickinson\r\nof Delaware, the author of the Farmer's Letters and chairman of\r\nthe committee of Congress that had framed the Articles of\r\nConfederation--able, scholarly, and sincere, but nervous, sensitive,\r\nand conscientious to the verge of timidity--whose refusal to sign the\r\nDeclaration of Independence had cost him his popularity, though he was\r\nafterward returned to Congress and became president successively\r\nof Delaware and of Pennsylvania; Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, a\r\nsuccessful merchant, prominent in politics, and greatly interested\r\nin questions of commerce and finance; and the Connecticut delegates,\r\nforming an unusual trio, Dr. William Samuel Johnson, Roger Sherman, and\r\nOliver Ellsworth. These men were fearful of establishing too strong a\r\ngovernment and were at one time or another to be found in opposition to\r\nMadison and his supporters. They were not mere obstructionists, however,\r\nand while not constructive in the same way that Madison and Wilson\r\nwere, they must be given some credit for the form which the Constitution\r\nfinally assumed. Their greatest service was in restraining the tendency\r\nof the majority to overrule the rights of States and in modifying the\r\ndesires of individuals for a government that would have been too strong\r\nto work well in practice.\r\n\r\nAlexander Hamilton of New York, as one of the ablest members of the\r\nConvention, was expected to take an important part, but he was out of\r\ntouch with the views of the majority. He was aristocratic rather than\r\ndemocratic and, however excellent his ideas may have been, they were too\r\nradical for his fellow delegates and found but little support. He threw\r\nhis strength in favor of a strong government and was ready to aid the\r\nmovement in whatever way he could. But within his own delegation he was\r\noutvoted by Robert Yates and John Lansing, and before the sessions were\r\nhalf over he was deprived of a vote by the withdrawal of his colleagues.\r\nThereupon, finding himself of little service, he went to New York and\r\nreturned to Philadelphia only once or twice for a few days at a time,\r\nand finally to sign the completed document. Luther Martin of Maryland\r\nwas an able lawyer and the Attorney-General of his State; but he was\r\nsupposed to be allied with undesirable interests, and it was said that\r\nhe had been sent to the Convention for the purpose of opposing a strong\r\ngovernment. He proved to be a tiresome speaker and his prosiness, when\r\nadded to the suspicion attaching to his motives, cost him much of the\r\ninfluence which he might otherwise have had.\r\n\r\nAll in all, the delegates to the Federal Convention were a remarkable\r\nbody of men. Most of them had played important parts in the drama of\r\nthe Revolution; three-fourths of them had served in Congress, and\r\npractically all were persons of note in their respective States and had\r\nheld important public positions. They may not have been the \"assembly of\r\ndemigods\" which Jefferson called them, for another contemporary insisted\r\n\"that twenty assemblies of equal number might be collected equally\r\nrespectable both in point of ability, integrity, and patriotism.\"\r\nPerhaps it would be safer to regard the Convention as a fairly\r\nrepresentative body, which was of a somewhat higher order than would\r\nbe gathered together today, because the social conditions of those\r\ndays tended to bring forward men of a better class, and because the\r\nseriousness of the crisis had called out leaders of the highest type.\r\n\r\nTwo or three days were consumed in organizing the Convention--electing\r\nofficers, considering the delegates' credentials, and adopting rules of\r\nprocedure; and when these necessary preliminaries had been accomplished\r\nthe main business was opened with the presentation by the Virginia\r\ndelegation of a series of resolutions providing for radical changes\r\nin the machinery of the Confederation. The principal features were the\r\norganization of a legislature of two houses proportional to population\r\nand with increased powers, the establishment of a separate executive,\r\nand the creation of an independent judiciary. This was in reality\r\nproviding for a new government and was probably quite beyond the ideas\r\nof most of the members of the Convention, who had come there under\r\ninstructions and with the expectation of revising the Articles of\r\nConfederation. But after the Virginia Plan had been the subject of\r\ndiscussion for two weeks so that the members had become a little more\r\naccustomed to its proposals, and after minor modifications had been made\r\nin the wording of the resolutions, the Convention was won over to its\r\nsupport. To check this drift toward radical change the opposition headed\r\nby New Jersey and Connecticut presented the so-called New Jersey\r\nPlan, which was in sharp contrast to the Virginia Resolutions, for it\r\ncontemplated only a revision of the Articles of Confederation, but after\r\na relatively short discussion, the Virginia Plan was adopted by a vote\r\nof seven States against four, with one State divided.\r\n\r\nThe dividing line between the two parties or groups in the Convention\r\nhad quickly manifested itself. It proved to be the same line that had\r\ndivided the Congress of the Confederation, the cleavage between the\r\nlarge States and the small States. The large States were in favor\r\nof representation in both houses of the legislature according to\r\npopulation, while the small States were opposed to any change which\r\nwould deprive them of their equal vote in Congress, and though outvoted,\r\nthey were not ready to yield. The Virginia Plan, and subsequently the\r\nNew Jersey Plan, had first been considered in committee of the whole,\r\nand the question of \"proportional representation,\" as it was then\r\ncalled, would accordingly come up again in formal session. Several weeks\r\nhad been occupied by the proceedings, so that it was now near the end of\r\nJune, and in general the discussions had been conducted with remarkably\r\ngood temper. But it was evidently the calm before the storm. And the\r\nissue was finally joined when the question of representation in the two\r\nhouses again came before the Convention. The majority of the States on\r\nthe 29th of June once more voted in favor of proportional representation\r\nin the lower house. But on the question of the upper house, owing to a\r\npeculiar combination of circumstances--the absence of one delegate and\r\nanother's change of vote causing the position of their respective States\r\nto be reversed or nullified--the vote on the 2d of July resulted in a\r\ntie. This brought the proceedings of the Convention to a standstill. A\r\ncommittee of one member from each State was appointed to consider the\r\nquestion, and, \"that time might be given to the Committee, and to\r\nsuch as chose to attend to the celebration on the anniversary of\r\nIndependence, the Convention adjourned\" over the Fourth. The committee\r\nwas chosen by ballot, and its composition was a clear indication that\r\nthe small-State men had won their fight, and that a compromise would be\r\neffected.\r\n\r\nIt was during the debate upon this subject, when feeling was running\r\nhigh and when at times it seemed as if the Convention in default of any\r\nsatisfactory solution would permanently adjourn, that Franklin proposed\r\nthat \"prayers imploring the assistance of Heaven ... be held in this\r\nAssembly every morning.\" Tradition relates that Hamilton opposed the\r\nmotion. The members were evidently afraid of the impression which would\r\nbe created outside, if it were suspected that there were dissensions in\r\nthe Convention, and the motion was not put to a vote.\r\n\r\nHow far physical conditions may influence men in adopting any particular\r\ncourse of action it is impossible to say. But just when the discussion\r\nin the Convention reached a critical stage, just when the compromise\r\npresented by the committee was ready for adoption or rejection, the\r\nweather turned from unpleasantly hot to being comfortably cool. And,\r\nafter some little time spent in the consideration of details, on the\r\n16th of July, the great compromise of the Constitution was adopted.\r\nThere was no other that compared with it in importance. Its most\r\nsignificant features were that in the upper house each State should\r\nhave an equal vote and that in the lower house representation should\r\nbe apportioned on the basis of population, while direct taxation should\r\nfollow the same proportion. The further proviso that money bills should\r\noriginate in the lower house and should not be amended in the upper\r\nhouse was regarded by some delegates as of considerable importance,\r\nthough others did not think so, and eventually the restriction upon\r\namendment by the upper house was dropped.\r\n\r\nThere has long been a prevailing belief that an essential feature of the\r\ngreat compromise was the counting of only three-fifths of the slaves in\r\nenumerating the population. This impression is quite erroneous. It was\r\none of the details of the compromise, but it had been a feature of the\r\nrevenue amendment of 1783, and it was generally accepted as a happy\r\nsolution of the difficulty that slaves possessed the attributes both\r\nof persons and of property. It had been included both in the amended\r\nVirginia Plan and in the New Jersey Plan; and when it was embodied in\r\nthe compromise it was described as \"the ratio recommended by Congress in\r\ntheir resolutions of April 18, 1783.\" A few months later, in explaining\r\nthe matter to the Massachusetts convention, Rufus King said that, \"This\r\nrule ... was adopted because it was the language of all America.\" In\r\nreality the three-fifths rule was a mere incident in that part of\r\nthe great compromise which declared that \"representation should be\r\nproportioned according to direct taxation.\" As a further indication of\r\nthe attitude of the Convention upon this point, an amendment to have the\r\nblacks counted equally with the whites was voted down by eight States\r\nagainst two.\r\n\r\nWith the adoption of the great compromise a marked difference was\r\nnoticeable in the attitude of the delegates. Those from the large States\r\nwere deeply disappointed at the result and they asked for an adjournment\r\nto give them time to consider what they should do. The next morning,\r\nbefore the Convention met, they held a meeting to determine upon\r\ntheir course of action. They were apparently afraid of taking the\r\nresponsibility for breaking up the Convention, so they finally decided\r\nto let the proceedings go on and to see what might be the ultimate\r\noutcome. Rumors of these dissensions had reached the ears of the public,\r\nand it may have been to quiet any misgivings that the following inspired\r\nitem appeared in several local papers: \"So great is the unanimity, we\r\nhear, that prevails in the Convention, upon all great federal subjects,\r\nthat it has been proposed to call the room in which they assemble\r\nUnanimity Hall.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the effect of this great compromise upon the delegates\r\nfrom the small States was distinctly favorable. Having obtained equal\r\nrepresentation in one branch of the legislature, they now proceeded with\r\nmuch greater willingness to consider the strengthening of the central\r\ngovernment. Many details were yet to be arranged, and sharp differences\r\nof opinion existed in connection with the executive as well as with the\r\njudiciary. But these difficulties were slight in comparison with those\r\nwhich they had already surmounted in the matter of representation. By\r\nthe end of July the fifteen resolutions of the original Virginia\r\nPlan had been increased to twenty-three, with many enlargements and\r\namendments, and the Convention had gone as far as it could effectively\r\nin determining the general principles upon which the government should\r\nbe formed. There were too many members to work efficiently when it came\r\nto the actual framing of a constitution with all the inevitable details\r\nthat were necessary in setting up a machinery of government. Accordingly\r\nthis task was turned over to a committee of five members who had already\r\ngiven evidence of their ability in this direction. Rutledge was made the\r\nchairman, and the others were Randolph, Gorham, Ellsworth, and Wilson.\r\nTo give them time to perfect their work, on the 26th of July the\r\nConvention adjourned for ten days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII FINISHING THE WORK\r\n\r\nRutledge and his associates on the committee of detail accomplished so\r\nmuch in such a short time that it seems as if they must have worked day\r\nand night. Their efforts marked a distinct stage in the development of\r\nthe Constitution. The committee left no records, but some of the members\r\nretained among their private papers drafts of the different stages of\r\nthe report they were framing, and we are therefore able to surmise the\r\nway in which the committee proceeded. Of course the members were bound\r\nby the resolutions which had been adopted by the Convention and they\r\nheld themselves closely to the general principles that had been laid\r\ndown. But in the elaboration of details they seem to have begun with the\r\nArticles of Confederation and to have used all of that document that was\r\nconsistent with the new plan of government. Then they made use of the\r\nNew Jersey Plan, which had been put forward by the smaller States, and\r\nof a third plan which had been presented by Charles Pinckney; for the\r\nrest they drew largely upon the State Constitutions. By a combination\r\nof these different sources the committee prepared a document bearing a\r\nclose resemblance to the present Constitution, although subjects were in\r\na different order and in somewhat different proportions, which, at the\r\nend of ten days, by working on Sunday, they were able to present to\r\nthe Convention. This draft of a constitution was printed on seven folio\r\npages with wide margins for notes and emendations.\r\n\r\nThe Convention resumed its sessions on Monday, the 6th of August, and\r\nfor five weeks the report of the committee of detail was the subject of\r\ndiscussion. For five hours each day, and sometimes for six hours, the\r\ndelegates kept persistently at their task. It was midsummer, and we read\r\nin the diary of one of the members that in all that period only five\r\ndays were \"cool.\" Item by item, line by line, the printed draft of the\r\nConstitution was considered. It is not possible, nor is it necessary, to\r\nfollow that work minutely; much of it was purely formal, and yet any one\r\nwho has had experience with committee reports knows how much importance\r\nattaches to matters of phrasing. Just as the Virginia Plan was made\r\nmore acceptable to the majority by changes in wording that seem to us\r\ninsignificant, so modifications in phrasing slowly won support for the\r\ndraft of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe adoption of the great compromise, as we have seen, changed the whole\r\nspirit of the Convention. There was now an expectation on the part of\r\nthe members that something definite was going to be accomplished, and\r\nall were concerned in making the result as good and as acceptable\r\nas possible. In other words, the spirit of compromise pervaded every\r\naction, and it is essential to remember this in considering what was\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest weaknesses of the Confederation was the inefficiency\r\nof Congress. More than four pages, or three-fifths of the whole printed\r\ndraft, were devoted to Congress and its powers. It is more significant,\r\nhowever, that in the new Constitution the legislative powers of the\r\nConfederation were transferred bodily to the Congress of the United\r\nStates, and that the powers added were few in number, although of course\r\nof the first importance. The Virginia Plan declared that, in addition to\r\nthe powers under the Confederation, Congress should have the right \"to\r\nlegislate in all cases to which the separate States are incompetent.\"\r\nThis statement was elaborated in the printed draft which granted\r\nspecific powers of taxation, of regulating commerce, of establishing\r\na uniform rule of naturalization, and at the end of the enumeration of\r\npowers two clauses were added giving to Congress authority:\r\n\r\nTo call forth the aid of the militia, in order to execute the laws\r\nof the Union, enforce treaties, suppress insurrections, and repel\r\ninvasions;\r\n\r\nAnd to make all laws that shall be necessary and proper for carrying\r\ninto execution the foregoing powers.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it was necessary to place some limitations upon\r\nthe power of Congress. A general restriction was laid by giving to\r\nthe executive a right of veto, which might be overruled, however, by a\r\ntwo-thirds vote of both houses. Following British tradition--yielding\r\nas it were to an inherited fear--these delegates in America were led to\r\nplace the first restraint upon the exercise of congressional authority\r\nin connection with treason. The legislature of the United States was\r\ngiven the power to declare the punishment of treason; but treason itself\r\nwas defined in the Constitution, and it was further asserted that\r\na person could be convicted of treason only on the testimony of two\r\nwitnesses, and that attainder of treason should not \"work corruption of\r\nblood nor forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted.\"\r\nArising more nearly out of their own experience was the prohibition\r\nof export taxes, of capitation taxes, and of the granting of titles of\r\nnobility.\r\n\r\nWhile the committee of detail was preparing its report, the Southern\r\nmembers of that committee had succeeded in getting a provision inserted\r\nthat navigation acts could be passed only by a two-thirds vote of\r\nboth houses of the legislature. New England and the Middle States were\r\nstrongly in favor of navigation acts for, if they could require all\r\nAmerican products to be carried in American-built and American-owned\r\nvessels, they would give a great stimulus to the ship-building and\r\ncommerce of the United States. They therefore wished to give Congress\r\npower in this matter on exactly the same terms that other powers were\r\ngranted. The South, however, was opposed to this policy, for it wanted\r\nto encourage the cheapest method of shipping its raw materials. The\r\nSouth also wanted a larger number of slaves to meet its labor demands.\r\nTo this need New England was not favorably disposed. To reconcile the\r\nconflicting interests of the two sections a compromise was finally\r\nreached. The requirement of a two-thirds vote of both houses for the\r\npassing of navigation acts which the Southern members had obtained was\r\nabandoned, and on the other hand it was determined that Congress should\r\nnot be allowed to interfere with the importation of slaves for twenty\r\nyears. This, again, was one of the important and conspicuous compromises\r\nof the Constitution. It is liable, however, to be misunderstood, for one\r\nshould not read into the sentiment of the members of the Convention\r\nany of the later strong prejudice against slavery. There were some\r\nwho objected on moral grounds to the recognition of slavery in the\r\nConstitution, and that word was carefully avoided by referring to \"such\r\nPersons as any States now existing shall think proper to admit.\" And\r\nthere were some who were especially opposed to the encouragement of\r\nthat institution by permitting the slave trade, but the majority of the\r\ndelegates regarded slavery as an accepted institution, as a part of the\r\nestablished order, and public sentiment on the slave trade was not much\r\nmore emphatic and positive than it is now on cruelty to animals. As\r\nEllsworth said, \"The morality or wisdom of slavery are considerations\r\nbelonging to the States themselves,\" and the compromise was nothing more\r\nor less than a bargain between the sections.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental weakness of the Confederation was the inability of the\r\nGovernment to enforce its decrees, and in spite of the increased powers\r\nof Congress, even including the use of the militia \"to execute the\r\nlaws of the Union,\" it was not felt that this defect had been entirely\r\nremedied. Experience under the Confederation had taught men that\r\nsomething more was necessary in the direction of restricting the\r\nStates in matters which might interfere with the working of the central\r\nGovernment. As in the case of the powers of Congress, the Articles of\r\nConfederation were again resorted to and the restrictions which had\r\nbeen placed upon the States in that document were now embodied in the\r\nConstitution with modifications and additions. But the final touch was\r\ngiven in connection with the judiciary.\r\n\r\nThere was little in the printed draft and there is comparatively little\r\nin the Constitution on the subject of the judiciary. A Federal Supreme\r\nCourt was provided for, and Congress was permitted, but not required, to\r\nestablish inferior courts; while the jurisdiction of these tribunals was\r\ndetermined upon the general principles that it should extend to cases\r\narising under the Constitution and laws of the United States, to\r\ntreaties and cases in which foreigners and foreign countries were\r\ninvolved, and to controversies between States and citizens of different\r\nStates. Nowhere in the document itself is there any word as to that\r\ngreat power which has been exercised by the Federal courts of\r\ndeclaring null and void laws or parts of laws that are regarded as in\r\ncontravention to the Constitution. There is little doubt that the more\r\nimportant men in the Convention, such as Wilson, Madison, Gouverneur\r\nMorris, King, Gerry, Mason, and Luther Martin, believed that the\r\njudiciary would exercise this power, even though it should not be\r\nspecifically granted. The nearest approach to a declaration of this\r\npower is to be found in a paragraph that was inserted toward the end\r\nof the Constitution. Oddly enough, this was a modification of a clause\r\nintroduced by Luther Martin with quite another intent. As adopted it\r\nreads: \"That this Constitution and the Laws of the United States ... and\r\nall Treaties ... shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges\r\nin every State shall be bound thereby; any Thing in the Constitution or\r\nLaws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\" This paragraph may\r\nwell be regarded as the keystone of the constitutional arch of national\r\npower. Its significance lies in the fact that the Constitution is\r\nregarded not as a treaty nor as an agreement between States, but as a\r\nlaw; and while its enforcement is backed by armed power, it is a law\r\nenforceable in the courts.\r\n\r\nOne whole division of the Constitution has been as yet barely referred\r\nto, and it not only presented one of the most perplexing problems which\r\nthe Convention faced but one of the last to be settled--that providing\r\nfor an executive. There was a general agreement in the Convention that\r\nthere should be a separate executive. The opinion also developed quite\r\nearly that a single executive was better than a plural body, but that\r\nwas as far as the members could go with any degree of unanimity. At the\r\noutset they seemed to have thought that the executive would be dependent\r\nupon the legislature, appointed by that body, and therefore more or\r\nless subject to its control. But in the course of the proceedings the\r\ntendency was to grant greater and greater powers to the executive; in\r\nother words, he was becoming a figure of importance. No such office as\r\nthat of President of the United States was then in existence. It was a\r\nnew position which they were creating. We have become so accustomed to\r\nit that it is difficult for us to hark back to the time when there was\r\nno such officer and to realize the difficulties and the fears of the men\r\nwho were responsible for creating that office.\r\n\r\nThe presidency was obviously modeled after the governorship of the\r\nindividual States, and yet the incumbent was to be at the head of the\r\nThirteen States. Rufus King is frequently quoted to the effect that the\r\nmen of that time had been accustomed to considering themselves subjects\r\nof the British king. Even at the time of the Convention there is good\r\nevidence to show that some of the members were still agitating the\r\ndesirability of establishing a monarchy in the United States. It was a\r\ncommon rumor that a son of George III was to be invited to come over,\r\nand there is reason to believe that only a few months before the\r\nConvention met Prince Henry of Prussia was approached by prominent\r\npeople in this country to see if he could be induced to accept the\r\nheadship of the States, that is, to become the king of the United\r\nStates. The members of the Convention evidently thought that they were\r\nestablishing something like a monarchy. As Randolph said, the people\r\nwould see \"the form at least of a little monarch,\" and they did not want\r\nhim to have despotic powers. When the sessions were over, a lady asked\r\nFranklin: \"Well, Doctor, what have we got, a republic or a monarchy?\" \"A\r\nrepublic,\" replied the doctor, \"if you can keep it.\"\r\n\r\nThe increase of powers accruing to the executive office necessitated\r\nplacing a corresponding check upon the exercise of those powers. The\r\nobvious method was to render the executive subject to impeachment,\r\nand it was also readily agreed that his veto might be overruled by a\r\ntwo-thirds vote of Congress; but some further safeguards were necessary,\r\nand the whole question accordingly turned upon the method of his\r\nelection and the length of his term. In the course of the proceedings of\r\nthe Convention, at several different times, the members voted in favor\r\nof an appointment by the national legislature, but they also voted\r\nagainst it. Once they voted for a system of electors chosen by the State\r\nlegislatures and twice they voted against such a system. Three times\r\nthey voted to reconsider the whole question. It is no wonder that Gerry\r\nshould say: \"We seem to be entirely at a loss.\"\r\n\r\nSo it came to the end of August, with most of the other matters disposed\r\nof and with the patience of the delegates worn out by the long strain\r\nof four weeks' close application. During the discussions it had become\r\napparent to every one that an election of the President by the people\r\nwould give a decided advantage to the large States, so that again there\r\nwas arising the divergence between the large and small States. In order\r\nto hasten matters to a conclusion, this and all other vexing details\r\nupon which the Convention could not agree were turned over to a\r\ncommittee made up of a member from each State. It was this committee\r\nwhich pointed the way to a compromise by which the choice of the\r\nexecutive was to be entrusted to electors chosen in each State as its\r\nlegislature might direct. The electors were to be equal in number to\r\nthe State's representation in Congress, including both senators and\r\nrepresentatives, and in each State they were to meet and to vote for\r\ntwo persons, one of whom should not be an inhabitant of that State. The\r\nvotes were to be listed and sent to Congress, and the person who had\r\nreceived the greatest number of votes was to be President, provided such\r\na number was a majority of all the electors. In case of a tie the Senate\r\nwas to choose between the candidates and, if no one had a majority, the\r\nSenate was to elect \"from the five highest on the list.\"\r\n\r\nThis method of voting would have given the large States a decided\r\nadvantage, of course, in that they would appoint the greater number\r\nof electors, but it was not believed that this system would ordinarily\r\nresult in a majority of votes being cast for one man. Apparently no one\r\nanticipated the formation of political parties which would concentrate\r\nthe votes upon one or another candidate. It was rather expected that\r\nin the great majority of cases--\"nineteen times in twenty,\" one of the\r\ndelegates said--there would be several candidates and that the selection\r\nfrom those candidates would fall to the Senate, in which all the States\r\nwere equally represented and the small States were in the majority. But\r\nsince the Senate shared so many powers with the executive, it seemed\r\nbetter to transfer the right of \"eventual election\" to the House of\r\nRepresentatives, where each State was still to have but one vote. Had\r\nthis scheme worked as the designers expected, the interests of large\r\nStates and small States would have been reconciled, since in effect the\r\nlarge States would name the candidates and, \"nineteen times in twenty,\"\r\nthe small States would choose from among them.\r\n\r\nApparently the question of a third term was never considered by the\r\ndelegates in the Convention. The chief problem before them was\r\nthe method of election. If the President was to be chosen by the\r\nlegislature, he should not be eligible to reëlection. On the other hand,\r\nif there was to be some form of popular election, an opportunity for\r\nreëlection was thought to be a desirable incentive to good behavior. Six\r\nor seven years was taken as an acceptable length for a single term and\r\nfour years a convenient tenure if reëlection was permitted. It was upon\r\nthese considerations that the term of four years was eventually agreed\r\nupon, with no restriction placed upon reëlection.\r\n\r\nWhen it was believed that a satisfactory method of choosing the\r\nPresident had been discovered--and it is interesting to notice the\r\nmembers of the Convention later congratulated themselves that at least\r\nthis feature of their government was above criticism--it was decided\r\nto give still further powers to the President, such as the making of\r\ntreaties and the appointing of ambassadors and judges, although the\r\nadvice and consent of the Senate was required, and in the case of\r\ntreaties two-thirds of the members present must consent.\r\n\r\nThe presidency was frankly an experiment, the success of which would\r\ndepend largely upon the first election; yet no one seems to have been\r\nanxious about the first choice of chief magistrate, and the reason is\r\nnot far to seek. From the moment the members agreed that there should be\r\na single executive they also agreed upon the man for the position.\r\nJust as Washington had been chosen unanimously to preside over the\r\nConvention, so it was generally accepted that he would be the first head\r\nof the new state. Such at least was the trend of conversation and even\r\nof debate on the floor of the Convention. It indicates something of the\r\nconception of the office prevailing at the time that Washington, when\r\nhe became President, is said to have preferred the title, \"His High\r\nMightiness, the President of the United States and Protector of their\r\nLiberties.\"\r\n\r\nThe members of the Convention were plainly growing tired and there\r\nare evidences of haste in the work of the last few days. There was a\r\ntendency to ride rough-shod over those whose temperaments forced them\r\nto demand modifications in petty matters. This precipitancy gave rise to\r\nconsiderable dissatisfaction and led several delegates to declare\r\nthat they would not sign the completed document. But on the whole the\r\nsentiment of the Convention was overwhelmingly favorable. Accordingly\r\non Saturday, the 8th of September, a new committee was appointed, to\r\nconsist of five members, whose duty it was \"to revise the stile of\r\nand arrange the articles which had been agreed to by the House.\" The\r\ncommittee was chosen by ballot and was made up exclusively of friends of\r\nthe new Constitution: Doctor Johnson of Connecticut, Alexander Hamilton,\r\nwho had returned to Philadelphia to help in finishing the work,\r\nGouverneur Morris, James Madison, and Rufus King. On Wednesday the\r\ntwelfth, the Committee made its report, the greatest credit for which\r\nis probably to be given to Morris, whose powers of expression were so\r\ngreatly admired. Another day was spent in waiting for the report to be\r\nprinted. But on Thursday this was ready, and three days were devoted to\r\ngoing over carefully each article and section and giving the finishing\r\ntouches. By Saturday the work of the Convention was brought to a close,\r\nand the Constitution was then ordered to be engrossed. On Monday, the\r\n17th of September, the Convention met for the last time. A few of\r\nthose present being unwilling to sign, Gouverneur Morris again cleverly\r\ndevised a form which would make the action appear to be unanimous: \"Done\r\nin Convention by the unanimous consent of the states present ... in\r\nwitness whereof we have hereunto subscribed our names.\" Thirty-nine\r\ndelegates, representing twelve States, then signed the Constitution.\r\n\r\nWhen Charles Biddle of Philadelphia, who was acquainted with most of the\r\nmembers of the Convention, wrote his Autobiography, which was published\r\nin 1802, he declared that for his part he considered the government\r\nestablished by the Constitution to be \"the best in the world, and as\r\nperfect as any human form of government can be.\" But he prefaced that\r\ndeclaration with a statement that some of the best informed members\r\nof the Federal Convention had told him \"they did not believe a single\r\nmember was perfectly satisfied with the Constitution, but they believed\r\nit was the best they could ever agree upon, and that it was infinitely\r\nbetter to have such a one than break up without fixing on some form of\r\ngovernment, which I believe at one time it was expected they would have\r\ndone.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the outstanding characteristics of the members of the Federal\r\nConvention was their practical sagacity. They had a very definite object\r\nbefore them. No matter how much the members might talk about democracy\r\nin theory or about ancient confederacies, when it came to action they\r\ndid not go outside of their own experience. The Constitution was devised\r\nto correct well-known defects and it contained few provisions which had\r\nnot been tested by practical political experience. Before the Convention\r\nmet, some of the leading men in the country had prepared lists of the\r\ndefects which existed in the Articles of Confederation, and in the\r\nConstitution practically every one of these defects was corrected and by\r\nmeans which had already been tested in the States and under the Articles\r\nof Confederation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII THE UNION ESTABLISHED\r\n\r\nThe course of English history shows that Anglo-Saxon tradition is\r\nstrongly in favor of observing precedents and of trying to maintain\r\nat least the form of law, even in revolutions. When the English people\r\nfound it impossible to bear with James II and made it so uncomfortable\r\nfor him that he fled the country, they shifted the responsibility from\r\ntheir own shoulders by charging him with \"breaking the original Contract\r\nbetween King and People.\" When the Thirteen Colonies had reached the\r\npoint where they felt that they must separate from England, their\r\nspokesman, Thomas Jefferson, found the necessary justification in the\r\nfundamental compact of the first settlers \"in the wilds of America\"\r\nwhere \"the emigrants thought proper to adopt that system of laws\r\nunder which they had hitherto lived in the mother country\"; and in the\r\nDeclaration of Independence he charged the King of Great Britain with\r\n\"repeated injuries and usurpations all having in direct object the\r\nestablishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it was with the change to the new form of government in the\r\nUnited States, which was accomplished only by disregarding the forms\r\nprescribed in the Articles of Confederation and has been called,\r\ntherefore, \"the Revolution of 1789.\" From the outset the new\r\nconstitution was placed under the sanction of the old. The movement\r\nbegan with an attempt, outwardly at least, to revise the Articles of\r\nConfederation and in that form was authorized by Congress. The first\r\nbreach with the past was made when the proposal in the Virginia\r\nResolutions was accepted that amendments made by the Convention in the\r\nArticles of Confederation should be submitted to assemblies chosen by\r\nthe people instead of to the legislatures of the separate States. This\r\nwas the more readily accepted because it was believed that ratification\r\nby the legislatures would result in the formation of a treaty rather\r\nthan in a working instrument of government. The next step was to\r\nprevent the work of the Convention from meeting the fate of all previous\r\namendments to the Articles of Confederation, which had required the\r\nconsent of every State in the Union. At the time the committee of detail\r\nmade its report, the Convention was ready to agree that the consent of\r\nall the States was not necessary, and it eventually decided that, when\r\nratified by the conventions of nine States, the Constitution should go\r\ninto effect between the States so ratifying.\r\n\r\nIt was not within the province of the Convention to determine what the\r\ncourse of procedure should be in the individual States; so it simply\r\ntransmitted the Constitution to Congress and in an accompanying\r\ndocument, which significantly omitted any request for the approval of\r\nCongress, strongly expressed the opinion that the Constitution should\r\n\"be submitted to a convention of delegates chosen in each state by the\r\npeople thereof.\" This was nothing less than indirect ratification by the\r\npeople; and, since it was impossible to foretell in advance which of the\r\nStates would or would not ratify, the original draft of \"We, the People\r\nof the States of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, ...\" was\r\nchanged to the phrase \"We, the People of the United States.\" No man of\r\nthat day could imagine how significant this change would appear in the\r\nlight of later history.\r\n\r\nCongress did not receive the new Constitution enthusiastically, yet\r\nafter a few days' discussion it unanimously voted, eleven States being\r\npresent, that the recommendations of the Convention should be followed,\r\nand accordingly sent the document to the States, but without a word of\r\napproval or disapproval. On the whole the document was well received,\r\nespecially as it was favored by the upper class, who had the ability and\r\nthe opportunity for expression and were in a position to make themselves\r\nheard. For a time it looked as if the Constitution would be readily\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nThe contest over the Constitution in the States is usually taken as\r\nmarking the beginning of the two great national political parties in\r\nthe United States. This was, indeed, in a way the first great national\r\nquestion that could cause such a division. There had been, to be sure,\r\nWhigs and Tories in America, reproducing British parties, but when the\r\ntrouble with the mother country began, the successive congresses of\r\ndelegates were recognized and attended only by the so-called American\r\nWhigs, and after the Declaration of Independence the name of Tory became\r\na reproach, so that with the end of the war the Tory party disappeared.\r\nAfter the Revolution there were local parties in the various States,\r\ndivided on one and another question, such as that of hard and soft\r\nmoney, and these issues had coincided in different States; but they were\r\nin no sense national parties with organizations, platforms, and leaders;\r\nthey were purely local, and the followers of one or the other would have\r\ndenied that they were anything else than Whigs. But a new issue was\r\nnow raised. The Whig party split in two, new leaders appeared, and the\r\nelements gathered in two main divisions--the Federalists advocating, and\r\nthe Anti-Federalists opposing, the adoption of the new Constitution.\r\n\r\nThere were differences of opinion over all the questions which had\r\nled to the calling of the Federal Convention and the framing of the\r\nConstitution and so there was inevitably a division upon the result of\r\nthe Convention's work. There were those who wanted national authority\r\nfor the suppression of disorder and of what threatened to be anarchy\r\nthroughout the Union; and on the other hand there were those who opposed\r\na strongly organized government through fear of its destroying liberty.\r\nEspecially debtors and creditors took opposite sides, and most of the\r\npeople in the United States could have been brought under one or\r\nthe other category. The former favored a system of government and\r\nlegislation which would tend to relieve or postpone the payment of\r\ndebts; and, as that relief would come more readily from the State\r\nGovernments, they were naturally the friends of State rights and State\r\nauthority and were opposed to any enlargement of the powers of the\r\nFederal Government. On the other hand, were those who felt the necessity\r\nof preserving inviolate every private and public obligation and who\r\nsaw that the separate power of the States could not accomplish what was\r\nnecessary to sustain both public and private credit; they were\r\ndisposed to use the resources of the Union and accordingly to favor the\r\nstrengthening of the national government. In nearly every State there\r\nwas a struggle between these classes.\r\n\r\nIn Philadelphia and the neighborhood there was great enthusiasm for the\r\nnew Constitution. Almost simultaneously with the action by Congress, and\r\nbefore notification of it had been received, a motion was introduced\r\nin the Pennsylvania Assembly to call a ratifying convention. The\r\nAnti-Federalists were surprised by the suddenness of this proposal and\r\nto prevent action absented themselves from the session of the Assembly,\r\nleaving that body two short of the necessary quorum for the transaction\r\nof business. The excitement and indignation in the city were so great\r\nthat early the next morning a crowd gathered, dragged two of the\r\nabsentees from their lodgings to the State House, and held them firmly\r\nin their places until the roll was called and a quorum counted, when the\r\nHouse proceeded to order a State convention. As soon as the news of this\r\nvote got out, the city gave itself up to celebrating the event by\r\nthe suspension of business, the ringing of church bells, and other\r\ndemonstrations. The elections were hotly contested, but the Federalists\r\nwere generally successful. The convention met towards the end of\r\nNovember and, after three weeks of futile discussion, mainly upon\r\ntrivial matters and the meaning of words, ratified the Constitution on\r\nthe 12th of December, by a vote of forty-six to twenty-three. Again the\r\ncity of Philadelphia celebrated.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania was the first State to call a convention, but its final\r\naction was anticipated by Delaware, where the State convention met and\r\nratified the Constitution by unanimous vote on the 7th of December. The\r\nNew Jersey convention spent only a week in discussion and then voted,\r\nalso unanimously, for ratification on the 18th of December. The next\r\nState to ratify was Georgia, where the Constitution was approved without\r\na dissenting vote on January 2, 1788. Connecticut followed immediately\r\nand, after a session of only five days, declared itself in favor of the\r\nConstitution, on the 9th of January, by a vote of over three to one.\r\n\r\nThe results of the campaign for ratification thus far were most\r\ngratifying to the Federalists, but the issue was not decided. With the\r\nexception of Pennsylvania, the States which had acted were of lesser\r\nimportance, and, until Massachusetts, New York, and Virginia should\r\ndeclare themselves, the outcome would be in doubt. The convention\r\nof Massachusetts met on the same day that the Connecticut convention\r\nadjourned. The sentiment of Boston, like that of Philadelphia, was\r\nstrongly Federalist; but the outlying districts, and in particular the\r\nwestern part of the State, where Shays' Rebellion had broken out, were\r\nto be counted in the opposition. There were 355 delegates who took part\r\nin the Massachusetts convention, a larger number than was chosen in\r\nany of the other States, and the majority seemed to be opposed to\r\nratification. The division was close, however, and it was believed that\r\nthe attitude of two men would determine the result. One of these was\r\nGovernor John Hancock, who was chosen chairman of the convention but\r\nwho did not attend the sessions at the outset, as he was confined to\r\nhis house by an attack of gout, which, it was maliciously said,\r\nwould disappear as soon as it was known which way the majority of the\r\nconvention would vote. The other was Samuel Adams, a genuine friend\r\nof liberty, who was opposed on principle to the general theory of the\r\ngovernment set forth in the Constitution. \"I stumble at the threshold,\"\r\nhe wrote. \"I meet with a national government, instead of a federal union\r\nof sovereign states.\" But, being a shrewd politician, Adams did not\r\ncommit himself openly and, when the tradesmen of Boston declared\r\nthemselves in favor of ratification, he was ready to yield his personal\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nThere were many delegates in the Massachusetts convention who felt that\r\nit was better to amend the document before them than to try another\r\nFederal Convention, when as good an instrument might not be devised. If\r\nthis group were added to those who were ready to accept the Constitution\r\nas it stood, they would make a majority in favor of the new government.\r\nBut the delay involved in amending was regarded as dangerous, and it was\r\nargued that, as the Constitution made ample provision for changes, it\r\nwould be safer and wiser to rely upon that method. The question was one,\r\ntherefore, of immediate or future amendment. Pressure was accordingly\r\nbrought to bear upon Governor Hancock and intimations were made to\r\nhim of future political preferment, until he was persuaded to\r\npropose immediate ratification of the Constitution, with an urgent\r\nrecommendation of such amendments as would remove the objections of\r\nthe Massachusetts people. When this proposal was approved by Adams, its\r\nsuccess was assured, and a few days later, on the 6th of February, the\r\nconvention voted 187 to 168 in favor of ratification. Nine amendments,\r\nlargely in the nature of a bill of rights, were then demanded, and the\r\nMassachusetts representatives in Congress were enjoined \"at all times,\r\n... to exert all their influence, and use all reasonable and legal\r\nmethods, To obtain a ratification of the said alterations and\r\nprovisions.\" On the very day this action was taken, Jefferson wrote\r\nfrom Paris to Madison: \"I wish with all my soul that the nine first\r\nconventions may accept the new Constitution, to secure to us the good\r\nit contains; but I equally wish that the four latest, whichever they may\r\nbe, may refuse to accede to it till a declaration of rights be annexed.\"\r\n\r\nBoston proceeded to celebrate as Philadelphia, and Benjamin Lincoln\r\nwrote to Washington, on the 9th of February, enclosing an extract from\r\nthe local paper describing the event:\r\n\r\nBy the paper your Excellency will observe some account of the parade of\r\nthe Eighth the printer had by no means time eno' to do justice to the\r\nsubject. To give you some idea how far he has been deficient I will\r\nmention an observation I heard made by a Lady the last evening who saw\r\nthe whole that the description in the paper would no more compare with\r\nthe original than the light of the faintest star would with that of the\r\nSun fortunately for us the whole ended without the least disorder\r\nand the town during the whole evening was, so far as I could observe\r\nperfectly quiet. ¹\r\n\r\nHe added another paragraph which he later struck out as being of little\r\nimportance; but it throws an interesting sidelight upon the customs of\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\nThe Gentlemen provided at Faneul Hall some biscuit & cheese four qr\r\nCasks of wine three barrels & two hogs of punch the moment they found\r\nthat the people had drank sufficiently means were taken to overset the\r\ntwo hogs punch this being done the company dispersed and the day ended\r\nmost agreeably ²\r\n\r\n¹ Documentary History, vol. iv, pp. 488-490. ² Ibid.\r\n\r\nMaryland came next. When the Federal Convention was breaking up, Luther\r\nMartin was speaking of the new system of government to his colleague,\r\nDaniel of St. Thomas Jenifer, and exclaimed: \"I'll be hanged if ever\r\nthe people of Maryland agree to it!\" To which his colleague retorted:\r\n\"I advise you to stay in Philadelphia, lest you should be hanged.\" And\r\nJenifer proved to be right, for in Maryland the Federalists obtained\r\ncontrol of the convention and, by a vote of 63 to 11, ratified the\r\nConstitution on the 26th of April.\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina, which was the Southern State next in importance to\r\nVirginia, the compromise on the slave trade proved to be one of the\r\ndeciding factors in determining public opinion. When the elections were\r\nheld, they resulted in an overwhelming majority for the Federalists, so\r\nthat after a session of less than two weeks the convention ratified the\r\nConstitution, on the 28th of May, by a vote of over two to one.\r\n\r\nThe only apparent setback which the adoption of the Constitution had\r\nthus far received was in New Hampshire, where the convention met early\r\nin February and then adjourned until June to see what the other States\r\nmight do. But this delay proved to be of no consequence for, when the\r\ntime came for the second meeting of the New Hampshire delegates, eight\r\nStates had already acted favorably and adoption was regarded as a\r\ncertainty. This was sufficient to put a stop to any further waiting, and\r\nNew Hampshire added its name to the list on the 21st of June; but the\r\ndivision of opinion was fairly well represented by the smallness of the\r\nmajority, the vote standing 57 to 46.\r\n\r\nNine States had now ratified the Constitution and it was to go into\r\neffect among them. But the support of Virginia and New York was of so\r\nmuch importance that their decisions were awaited with uneasiness. In\r\nVirginia, in spite of the support of such men as Washington and Madison,\r\nthe sentiment for and against the Constitution was fairly evenly\r\ndivided, and the opposition numbered in its ranks other names of almost\r\nequal influence, such as Patrick Henry and George Mason. Feeling ran\r\nhigh; the contest was a bitter one and, even after the elections had\r\nbeen held and the convention had opened, early in June, the decision was\r\nin doubt and remained in doubt until the very end. The situation was,\r\nin one respect at least, similar to that which had existed in\r\nMassachusetts, in that it was possible to get a substantial majority\r\nin favor of the Constitution provided certain amendments were made. The\r\nsame arguments were used, strengthened on the one side by what other\r\nStates had done, and on the other side by the plea that now was the time\r\nto hold out for amendments. The example of Massachusetts, however, seems\r\nto have been decisive, and on the 25th of June, four days later than\r\nNew Hampshire, the Virginia convention voted to ratify, \"under the\r\nconviction that whatsoever imperfections may exist in the Constitution\r\nought rather to be examined in the mode prescribed therein, than\r\nto bring the Union into danger by delay, with a hope of obtaining\r\namendments previous to the ratification.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the New York convention began its sessions on the 17th of June, it\r\nis said that more than two-thirds of the delegates were Anti-Federalist\r\nin sentiment. How a majority in favor of the Constitution was obtained\r\nhas never been adequately explained, but it is certain that the main\r\ncredit for the achievement belongs to Alexander Hamilton. He had early\r\nrealized how greatly it would help the prospects of the Constitution if\r\nthinking people could be brought to an appreciation of the importance\r\nand value of the new form of government. In order to reach the\r\nintelligent public everywhere, but particularly in New York, he\r\nprojected a series of essays which should be published in the\r\nnewspapers, setting forth the aims and purposes of the Constitution.\r\nHe secured the assistance of Madison and Jay, and before the end of\r\nOctober, 1787, published the first essay in The Independent Gazetteer.\r\nFrom that time on these papers continued to be printed over the\r\nsignature of \"Publius,\" sometimes as many as three or four in a week.\r\nThere were eighty-five numbers altogether, which have ever since been\r\nknown as The Federalist. Of these approximately fifty were the work of\r\nHamilton, Madison wrote about thirty and Jay five. Although the essays\r\nwere widely copied in other journals, and form for us the most important\r\ncommentary on the Constitution, making what is regarded as one of\r\nAmerica's greatest books, it is doubtful how much immediate influence\r\nthey had. Certainly in the New York convention itself Hamilton's\r\npersonal influence was a stronger force. His arguments were both\r\neloquent and cogent, and met every objection; and his efforts to win\r\nover the opposition were unremitting. The news which came by express\r\nriders from New Hampshire and then from Virginia were also deciding\r\nfactors, for New York could not afford to remain out of the new Union if\r\nit was to embrace States on either side. And yet the debate continued,\r\nas the opposition was putting forth every effort to make ratification\r\nconditional upon certain amendments being adopted. But Hamilton\r\nresolutely refused to make any concessions and at length was successful\r\nin persuading the New York convention, by a vote of 30 against 27, on\r\nthe 26th of July, to follow the example of Massachusetts and Virginia\r\nand to ratify the Constitution with merely a recommendation of future\r\namendments.\r\n\r\nThe satisfaction of the country at the outcome of the long and momentous\r\nstruggle over the adoption of the new government was unmistakable. Even\r\nbefore the action of New York had been taken, the Fourth of July was\r\nmade the occasion for a great celebration throughout the United States,\r\nboth as the anniversary of independence and as the consummation of the\r\nUnion by the adoption of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe general rejoicing was somewhat tempered, however, by the reluctance\r\nof North Carolina and Rhode Island to come under \"the new roof.\" Had\r\nthe convention which met on the 21st of July in North Carolina reached\r\na vote, it would probably have defeated the Constitution, but it was\r\ndoubtless restrained by the action of New York and adjourned without\r\ncoming to a decision. A second convention was called in September, 1789,\r\nand in the meantime the new government had come into operation and was\r\nbringing pressure to bear upon the recalcitrant States which refused to\r\nabandon the old union for the new. One of the earliest acts passed by\r\nCongress was a revenue act, levying duties upon foreign goods imported,\r\nwhich were made specifically to apply to imports from Rhode Island and\r\nNorth Carolina. This was sufficient for North Carolina, and on November\r\n21, 1789, the convention ratified the Constitution. But Rhode Island\r\nstill held out. A convention of that State was finally called to meet\r\nin March, 1790, but accomplished nothing and avoided a decision by\r\nadjourning until May. The Federal Government then proceeded to threaten\r\ndrastic measures by taking up a bill which authorized the President to\r\nsuspend all commercial intercourse with Rhode Island and to demand of\r\nthat State the payment of its share of the Federal debt. The bill passed\r\nthe Senate but stopped there, for the State gave in and ratified the\r\nConstitution on the 29th of May. Two weeks later Ellsworth, who was now\r\nUnited States Senator from Connecticut, wrote that Rhode Island had been\r\n\"brought into the Union, and by a pretty cold measure in Congress, which\r\nwould have exposed me to some censure, had it not produced the effect\r\nwhich I expected it would and which in fact it has done. But 'all is\r\nwell that ends well.' The Constitution is now adopted by all the States\r\nand I have much satisfaction, and perhaps some vanity, in seeing,\r\nat length, a great work finished, for which I have long labored\r\nincessantly.\" ¹\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most striking feature of these conventions is the trivial\r\ncharacter of the objections that were raised. Some of the arguments\r\nit is true, went to the very heart of the matter and considered the\r\nfundamental principles of government. It is possible to tolerate and\r\neven to sympathize with a man who declared:\r\n\r\nAmong other deformities the Constitution has an awful squinting. It\r\nsquints toward monarchy; ... your president may easily become a king....\r\nIf your American chief be a man of ambition and ability how easy it is\r\nfor him to render himself absolute. We shall have a king. The army will\r\nsalute him monarch. ²\r\n\r\nBut it is hard to take seriously a delegate who asked permission \"to\r\nmake a short apostrophe to liberty,\" and then delivered himself of this\r\nbathos:\r\n\r\nO liberty!--thou greatest good--thou fairest property--with thee I wish\r\nto live--with thee I wish to die!--Pardon me if I drop a tear on the\r\nperil to which she is exposed; I cannot, sir, see this brightest of\r\njewels tarnished! a jewel worth ten thousand worlds! and shall we part\r\nwith it so soon? O no! ³\r\n\r\n¹, ² \"Connecticut's Ratification of the Federal Constitution,\" by B.\r\nC. Steiner, in Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society, April,\r\n1915, pp. 88-89.\r\n\r\n³ Elliot's Debates on the Federal Constitution, vol. iii, p. 144.\r\n\r\nThere might be some reason in objecting to the excessive power vested\r\nin Congress; but what is one to think of the fear that imagined the\r\ngreatest point of danger to lie in the ten miles square which later\r\nbecame the District of Columbia, because the Government might erect a\r\nfortified stronghold which would be invincible? Again, in the light of\r\nsubsequent events it is laughable to find many protesting that, although\r\neach house was required to keep a journal of proceedings, it was only\r\nrequired \"from time to time to publish the same, excepting such parts\r\nas may in their judgment require secrecy.\" All sorts of personal charges\r\nwere made against those who were responsible for the framing of the\r\nConstitution. Hopkinson wrote to Jefferson in April, 1788:\r\n\r\nYou will be surprised when I tell you that our public News Papers have\r\nannounced General Washington to be a Fool influenced & lead by that\r\nKnave Dr. Franklin, who is a public Defaulter for Millions of Dollars,\r\nthat Mr. Morris has defrauded the Public out of as many Millions as you\r\nplease & that they are to cover their frauds by this new Government. ¹\r\n\r\n¹ Documentary History of the Constitution, vol. iv, p. 563.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that such\r\ncritics and detractors were trying to find excuses for their opposition.\r\n\r\nThe majorities in the various conventions can hardly be said really to\r\nrepresent the people of their States, for only a small percentage of the\r\npeople had voted in electing them; they were representative rather of\r\nthe propertied upper class. This circumstance has given rise to the\r\ncharge that the Constitution was framed and adopted by men who were\r\ninterested in the protection of property, in the maintenance of the\r\nvalue of government securities, and in the payment of debts which had\r\nbeen incurred by the individual States in the course of the Revolution.\r\nProperty-holders were unquestionably assisted by the mere establishment\r\nof a strong government. The creditor class seemed to require some\r\nspecial provision and, when the powers of Congress were under\r\nconsideration in the Federal Convention, several of the members argued\r\nstrongly for a positive injunction on Congress to assume obligations\r\nof the States. The chief objection to this procedure seemed to be based\r\nupon the fear of benefiting speculators rather than the legitimate\r\ncreditors, and the matter was finally compromised by providing that\r\nall debts should be \"as valid against the United States under\r\nthis Constitution as under the Confederation.\" The charge that the\r\nConstitution was framed and its adoption obtained by men of property and\r\nwealth is undoubtedly true, but it is a mistake to attribute unworthy\r\nmotives to them. The upper classes in the United States were generally\r\npeople of wealth and so would be the natural holders of government\r\nsecurities. They were undoubtedly acting in self-protection, but the\r\nresponsibility rested upon them to take the lead. They were acting\r\nindeed for the public interest in the largest sense, for conditions in\r\nthe United States were such that every man might become a landowner\r\nand the people in general therefore wished to have property rights\r\nprotected.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1788 the Congress of the old Confederation made\r\ntestamentary provision for its heir by voting that presidential electors\r\nshould be chosen on the first Wednesday in January, 1789; that these\r\nelectors should meet and cast their votes for President on the first\r\nWednesday in February; and that the Senate and House of Representatives\r\nshould assemble on the first Wednesday in March. It was also decided\r\nthat the seat of government should be in the City of New York until\r\notherwise ordered by Congress. In accordance with this procedure,\r\nthe requisite elections were held, and the new government was duly\r\ninstalled. It happened in 1789 that the first Wednesday in March was\r\nthe fourth day of that month, which thereby became the date for the\r\nbeginning of each subsequent administration.\r\n\r\nThe acid test of efficiency was still to be applied to the new machinery\r\nof government. But Americans then, as now, were an adaptable people,\r\nwith political genius, and they would have been able to make almost any\r\nform of government succeed. If the Federal Convention had never met,\r\nthere is good reason for believing that the Articles of Confederation,\r\nwith some amendments, would have been made to work. The success of the\r\nnew government was therefore in a large measure dependent upon the favor\r\nof the people. If they wished to do so, they could make it win out in\r\nspite of obstacles. In other words, the new government would succeed\r\nexactly to the extent to which the people stood back of it. This was the\r\ncritical moment when the slowly growing prosperity, described at length\r\nand emphasized in the previous chapters, produced one of its most\r\nimportant effects. In June, 1788, Washington wrote to Lafayette:\r\n\r\nI expect, that many blessings will be attributed to our new government,\r\nwhich are now taking their rise from that industry and frugality into\r\nthe practice of which the people have been forced from necessity. I\r\nreally believe that there never was so much labour and economy to be\r\nfound before in the country as at the present moment. If they persist\r\nin the habits they are acquiring, the good effects will soon be\r\ndistinguishable. When the people shall find themselves secure under an\r\nenergetic government, when foreign Nations shall be disposed to give us\r\nequal advantages in commerce from dread of retaliation, when the burdens\r\nof the war shall be in a manner done away by the sale of western lands,\r\nwhen the seeds of happiness which are sown here shall begin to expand\r\nthemselves, and when every one (under his own vine and fig-tree) shall\r\nbegin to taste the fruits of freedom--then all these blessings (for all\r\nthese blessings will come) will be referred to the fostering influence\r\nof the new government. Whereas many causes will have conspired to\r\nproduce them.\r\n\r\nA few months later a similar opinion was expressed by Crèvecœur in\r\nwriting to Jefferson:\r\n\r\nNever was so great a change in the opinion of the best people as has\r\nhappened these five years; almost everybody feels the necessity of\r\ncoercive laws, government, union, industry, and labor.... The exports of\r\nthis country have singularly increased within these two years, and the\r\nimports have decreased in proportion.\r\n\r\nThe new Federal Government was fortunate in beginning its career at the\r\nmoment when returning prosperity was predisposing the people to think\r\nwell of it. The inauguration of Washington marked the opening of a new\r\nera for the people of the United States of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX ¹\r\n\r\n¹ The documents in this Appendix follow the text of the Revised\r\nStatutes of the United States, Second Edition, 1878. THE DECLARATION OF\r\nINDEPENDENCE--1776. In Congress, July 4, 1776\r\n\r\nThe unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America\r\n\r\nWhen in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people\r\nto dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another,\r\nand to assume among the Powers of the earth, the separate and equal\r\nstation to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them,\r\na decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should\r\ndeclare the causes which impel them to the separation.\r\n\r\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,\r\nthat they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,\r\nthat among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That\r\nto secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving\r\ntheir just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any\r\nForm of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of\r\nthe People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government,\r\nlaying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in\r\nsuch form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety\r\nand Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long\r\nestablished should not be changed for light and transient causes; and\r\naccordingly all experience hath shown, that mankind are more disposed\r\nto suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by\r\nabolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train\r\nof abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a\r\ndesign to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is\r\ntheir duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for\r\ntheir future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these\r\nColonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter\r\ntheir former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of\r\nGreat Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all\r\nhaving in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over\r\nthese States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.\r\n\r\nHe has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for\r\nthe public good.\r\n\r\nHe has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing\r\nimportance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should\r\nbe obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nHe has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large\r\ndistricts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right\r\nof Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and\r\nformidable to tyrants only.\r\n\r\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual,\r\nuncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records,\r\nfor the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nHe has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with\r\nmanly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\r\n\r\nHe has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause\r\nothers to be elected; whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of\r\nAnnihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise;\r\nthe State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of\r\ninvasion from without, and convulsions within.\r\n\r\nHe has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that\r\npurpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing\r\nto pass others to encourage their migration hither, and raising the\r\nconditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\r\n\r\nHe has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent\r\nto Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.\r\n\r\nHe has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their\r\noffices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\r\n\r\nHe has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of\r\nOfficers to harrass our People, and eat out their substance.\r\n\r\nHe has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the\r\nConsent of our legislature.\r\n\r\nHe has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to\r\nthe Civil Power.\r\n\r\nHe has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to\r\nour constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to\r\ntheir acts of pretended Legislation:\r\n\r\nFor quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\r\n\r\nFor protecting them, by a mock Trial, from Punishment for any Murders\r\nwhich they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:\r\n\r\nFor cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:\r\n\r\nFor imposing taxes on us without our Consent:\r\n\r\nFor depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:\r\n\r\nFor transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:\r\n\r\nFor abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring\r\nProvince, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging\r\nits Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument\r\nfor introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:\r\n\r\nFor taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and\r\naltering fundamentally the Forms of our Government:\r\n\r\nFor suspending our own Legislature, and declaring themselves invested\r\nwith Power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\r\n\r\nHe has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection\r\nand waging War against us.\r\n\r\nHe has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and\r\ndestroyed the lives of our people.\r\n\r\nHe is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to\r\ncompleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun\r\nwith circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most\r\nbarbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.\r\n\r\nHe has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas\r\nto bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their\r\nfriends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.\r\n\r\nHe has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to\r\nbring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages,\r\nwhose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all\r\nages, sexes and conditions.\r\n\r\nIn every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in\r\nthe most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by\r\nrepeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act\r\nwhich may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free People.\r\n\r\nNor have We been wanting in attention to our Brittish brethren. We have\r\nwarned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend\r\nan unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the\r\ncircumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to\r\ntheir native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the\r\nties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would\r\ninevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence[.] They too\r\nhave been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must,\r\ntherefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation,\r\nand hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace\r\nFriends.\r\n\r\nWe, therefore, the Representative of the united States of America, in\r\nGeneral Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world\r\nfor the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority\r\nof the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That\r\nthese United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent\r\nStates; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown,\r\nand that all political connection between them and the State of Great\r\nBritain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and\r\nIndependent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace,\r\ncontract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and\r\nThings which Independent States may of right do. And for the support\r\nof this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the Protection of Divine\r\nProvidence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and\r\nour sacred Honor.\r\n\r\nJOHN HANCOCK.\r\n\r\nNew Hampshire.\r\n\r\nJosiah Bartlett, Wm.

And\r\nthe officers and men so cloathed, armed and equipped, shall march to the\r\nplace appointed, and within the time agreed on by the United States in\r\nCongress assembled.\r\n\r\nThe United States in Congress assembled shall never engage in a war, nor\r\ngrant letters of marque and reprisal in time of peace, nor enter into\r\nany treaties or alliances, nor coin money, nor regulate the value\r\nthereof, nor ascertain the sums and expenses necessary for the defence\r\nand welfare of the United States, or any of them, nor emit bills, nor\r\nborrow money on the credit of the United States, nor appropriate money,\r\nnor agree upon the number of vessels of war, to be built or purchased,\r\nor the number of land or sea forces to be raised, nor appoint a\r\ncommander in chief of the army or navy, unless nine States assent to\r\nthe same: nor shall a question on any other point, except for adjourning\r\nfrom day to day be determined, unless by the votes of a majority of the\r\nUnited States in Congress assembled.\r\n\r\nThe Congress of the United States shall have power to adjourn to any\r\ntime within the year, and to any place within the United States, so that\r\nno period of adjournment be for a longer duration than the space of\r\nsix months, and shall publish the journal of their proceedings monthly,\r\nexcept such parts thereof relating to treaties, alliances or military\r\noperations, as in their judgment require secresy; and the yeas and nays\r\nof the delegates of each State on any question shall be entered on the\r\njournal, when it is desired by any delegate; and the delegates of a\r\nState, or any of them, at his or their request shall be furnished with a\r\ntranscript of the said journal, except such parts as are above excepted,\r\nto lay before the Legislatures of the several States.\r\n\r\nArticle X. The committee of the States, or any nine of them, shall be\r\nauthorized to execute, in the recess of Congress, such of the powers of\r\nCongress as the United States in Congress assembled, by the consent of\r\nnine States, shall from time to time think expedient to vest them with;\r\nprovided that no power be delegated to the said committee, for the\r\nexercise of which, by the articles of confederation, the voice of nine\r\nStates in the Congress of the United States assembled is requisite.\r\n\r\nArticle XI.

Know ye that we the undersigned\r\ndelegates, by virtue of the power and authority to us given for\r\nthat purpose, do by these presents, in the name and in behalf of our\r\nrespective constituents, fully and entirely ratify and confirm each and\r\nevery of the said articles of confederation and perpetual union, and all\r\nand singular the matters and things therein contained: and we do further\r\nsolemnly plight and engage the faith of our respective constituents,\r\nthat they shall abide by the determinations of the United States in\r\nCongress assembled, on all questions, which by the said confederation\r\nare submitted to them.

He shall hold his Office during the Term of\r\nfour Years, and, together with the Vice President, chosen for the same\r\nTerm, be elected, as follows\r\n\r\n2 Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof\r\nmay direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators\r\nand Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress:\r\nbut no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust\r\nor Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.\r\n\r\n3 The Congress may determine the Time of chusing the Electors, and the\r\nDay on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same\r\nthroughout the United States.\r\n\r\n4 No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United\r\nStates, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be\r\neligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be\r\neligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty\r\nfive Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States.\r\n\r\n5 In Case of the Removal of the President from Office, or of his Death,\r\nResignation, or Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said\r\nOffice, the same shall devolve on the Vice President, and the Congress\r\nmay by Law provide for the Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or\r\nInability, both of the President and Vice President, declaring what\r\nOfficer shall then act as President, and such Officer shall act\r\naccordingly, until the Disability be removed, or a President shall be\r\nelected.\r\n\r\n6 The President shall, at stated Times, receive for his Services, a\r\nCompensation, which shall neither be encreased nor diminished during the\r\nPeriod for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive\r\nwithin that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n7 Before he enter on the Execution of his Office, he shall take the\r\nfollowing Oath or Affirmation:--\"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that\r\nI will faithfully execute the Office of the President of the United\r\nStates, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend\r\nthe Constitution of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nSection. 2. 1 The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and\r\nNavy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States,\r\nwhen called into the actual Service of the United States; he may\r\nrequire the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the\r\nexecutive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their\r\nrespective Offices, and he shall have Power to grant Reprieves and\r\nPardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of\r\nImpeachment.\r\n\r\n2 He shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate,\r\nto make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur;\r\nand he shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the\r\nSenate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls,\r\nJudges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United\r\nStates, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and\r\nwhich shall be established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vest\r\nthe Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the\r\nPresident alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.\r\n\r\n3 The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may\r\nhappen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which\r\nshall expire at the End of their next Session.\r\n\r\nSection. 3.

The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of\r\nthe United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and\r\nConviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE III.\r\n\r\nSection. 1. The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in\r\none supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from\r\ntime to time ordain and establish. The Judges, both of the supreme and\r\ninferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour, and\r\nshall, at stated Times, receive for their Services, a Compensation,\r\nwhich shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.\r\n\r\nSection. 2. 1 The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and\r\nEquity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States,\r\nand Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority;--to\r\nall Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls;--to\r\nall Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction;--to Controversies to\r\nwhich the United States shall be a Party;--to Controversies between two\r\nor more States;--between a State and Citizens of another State--between\r\nCitizens of different States,--between Citizens of the same State\r\nclaiming Lands under Grants of different States, and between a State, or\r\nthe Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects;\r\n\r\n2 In all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and\r\nConsuls, and those in which a State shall be Party, the supreme\r\nCourt shall have original Jurisdiction. In all the other Cases before\r\nmentioned, the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as\r\nto Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the\r\nCongress shall make.\r\n\r\n3 The Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by\r\nJury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes\r\nshall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the\r\nTrial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have\r\ndirected.\r\n\r\nSection. 3. 1 Treason against the United States, shall consist only in\r\nlevying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them\r\nAid and Comfort. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the\r\nTestimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in\r\nopen Court.\r\n\r\n2 The Congress shall have Power to declare the Punishment of Treason,\r\nbut no Attainder of Treason shall work Corruption of Blood, or\r\nForfeiture except during the Life of the Person attainted.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE IV.\r\n\r\nSection. 1.

The United States shall guarantee to every State in this\r\nUnion a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them\r\nagainst Invasion; and on Application of the Legislature, or of the\r\nExecutive (when the Legislature cannot be convened) against domestic\r\nViolence.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE V.\r\n\r\nThe Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it\r\nnecessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the\r\nApplication of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States,\r\nshall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either\r\nCase, shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as Part of this\r\nConstitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the\r\nseveral States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof, as the\r\none or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the Congress;\r\nProvided that no Amendment which may be made prior to the Year One\r\nthousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect the first\r\nand fourth Clauses in the Ninth Section of the first Article; and that\r\nno State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage\r\nin the Senate.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE. VI.\r\n\r\n1 All Debts contracted and Engagements entered into, before the Adoption\r\nof this Constitution, shall be as valid against the United States under\r\nthis Constitution, as under the Confederation.\r\n\r\n2 This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be\r\nmade in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be\r\nmade, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law\r\nof the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby,\r\nany Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary\r\nnotwithstanding.\r\n\r\n3 The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of\r\nthe several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers,\r\nboth of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by\r\nOath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious Test\r\nshall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust\r\nunder the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE VII.\r\n\r\nThe Ratification of the Conventions of nine States, shall be sufficient\r\nfor the Establishment of this Constitution between the States so\r\nratifying the Same.\r\n\r\nDone in Convention by the Unanimous consent of the States present the\r\nSeventeenth Day of September in the Year of our Lord one thousand seven\r\nhundred and Eighty seven and of the Independence of the United States of\r\nAmerica the Twelfth In witness whereof We have hereunto subscribed our\r\nNames,\r\n\r\nGO: WASHINGTON-- Presidt. and Deputy from Virginia.\r\n\r\nNew Hampshire.\r\n\r\nJohn Langdon Nicholas Gilman\r\n\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\nNathaniel Gorham Rufus King\r\n\r\nConnecticut.\r\n\r\nWm.

(1789, and\r\nsubsequently reprinted), gives but little space to this particular\r\nperiod, but it reveals the contemporary point of view. Richard\r\nHildreth's History of the United States, 6 vols. (1849-1852), is\r\nanother early work that is still of value, although it is written with\r\na Federalist bias. J. B. McMaster's History of the People of the United\r\nStates from the Revolution to the Civil War, 8 vols. (1883-1913),\r\npresents a kaleidoscopic series of pictures gathered largely from\r\ncontemporary newspapers, throwing light upon, and adding color to\r\nthe story. E. M. Avery's History of the United States, of which\r\nseven volumes have been published (1904-1910), is remarkable for its\r\nillustrations and reproductions of prints, documents, and maps. Edward\r\nChanning's History of the United States, of which four volumes have\r\nappeared (1905-1917), is the latest, most readable, and probably the\r\nbest of these comprehensive histories.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was subsequently published as Volume VI in a revised edition\r\nof his History of the United States of America, George Bancroft's\r\nHistory of the Formation of the Constitution, 2 vols. (1882), is really\r\na separate work. The author appears at his best in these volumes and has\r\nnever been entirely superseded by later writers. G. T. Curtis's History\r\nof the Constitution of the United States, 2 vols. (1854), which also\r\nsubsequently appeared as Volume I of his Constitutional History of the\r\nUnited States, is one of the standard works, but does not retain quite\r\nthe same hold that Bancroft's volumes do.\r\n\r\nOf the special works more nearly covering the same field as the present\r\nvolume, A. C. McLaughlin's The Confederation and the Constitution\r\n(1905), in the American Nation, is distinctly the best. John Fiske's\r\nCritical Period of American History (1888), written with the clearness\r\nof presentation and charm of style which are characteristic of the\r\nauthor, is an interesting and readable comprehensive account. Richard\r\nFrothingham's Rise of the Republic of the United States (1872; 6th ed.\r\n1895), tracing the two ideas of local self-government and of union,\r\nbegins with early colonial times and culminates in the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of peace opens up the whole field of diplomatic history,\r\nwhich has a bibliography of its own. But E. S. Corwin's French Policy\r\nand the American Alliance (1916) should be mentioned as the latest and\r\nbest work, although it lays more stress upon the phases indicated by\r\nthe title. C. H. Van Tyne's Loyalists in the American Revolution (1902)\r\nremains the standard work on this subject, but special studies are\r\nappearing from time to time which are changing our point of view.\r\n\r\nThe following books on economic and industrial aspects are not for\r\npopular reading, but are rather for reference: E. R. Johnson et al.,\r\nHistory of the Domestic and Foreign Commerce of the United States, 2\r\nvols. (1915); V. S. Clark, History of the Manufactures of the\r\nUnited States, 1607-1860 (1916). G. S. Callender has written short\r\nintroductions to the various chapters of his Selections from the\r\nEconomic History of the United States (1909), which are brilliant\r\ninterpretations of great value. P. J. Treat's The National Land System,\r\n1785-1820 (1910), gives the most satisfactory account of the subject\r\nindicated by the title. Of entirely different character is Theodore\r\nRoosevelt's Winning of the West, 4 vols. (1889-96; published\r\nsubsequently in various editions), which is both scholarly and of\r\nfascinating interest on the subject of the early expansion into the\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nOn the most important subject of all, the formation of the Constitution,\r\nthe material ordinarily wanted can be found in Max Farrand's Records of\r\nthe Federal Convention, 3 vols. (1910), and the author has summarized\r\nthe results of his studies in The Framing of the Constitution (1913). C.\r\nA. Beard's An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United\r\nStates (1913) gives some interesting and valuable facts regarding\r\neconomic aspects of the formation of the Constitution, and particularly\r\non the subject of investments in government securities. There is no\r\nsatisfactory account of the adoption of the Constitution, but the\r\ndebates in many of the State conventions are included in Jonathan\r\nElliot's Debates on the Federal Constitution, 5 vols. (1836-1845,\r\nsubsequently reprinted in many editions).\r\n\r\nA few special works upon the adoption of the Constitution in the\r\nindividual States may be mentioned: H. B. Grigsby's History of the\r\nVirginia Federal Convention of 1788, Virginia Historical Society\r\nCollections, N. S., IX and X (1890-91); McMaster and Stone's\r\nPennsylvania and the Federal Constitution, 1787-88 (1888); S. B.\r\nHarding's Contest over the Ratification of the Federal Constitution\r\nin the State of Massachusetts (1896); O. G. Libby's The Geographical\r\nDistribution of the Vote of the Thirteen States on the Federal\r\nConstitution, 1787-1788 (University of Wisconsin, Bulletin, Economics,\r\nPolitical Science, and History Series, I, No. 1, 1894).\r\n\r\nContemporary differences of opinion upon the Constitution will be found\r\nin P. L. Ford's Pamphlets on the Constitution, etc. (1888). The most\r\nvaluable commentary on the Constitution, The Federalist, is to be found\r\nin several editions of which the more recent are by E. H. Scott (1895)\r\nand P. L. Ford (1898).\r\n\r\nA large part of the so-called original documents or first-hand sources\r\nof information is to be found in letters and private papers of prominent\r\nmen. For most readers there is nothing better than the American\r\nStatesmen Series, from which the following might be selected: H. C.\r\nLodge's George Washington (2 vols., 1889) and Alexander Hamilton (1882);\r\nJ. T. Morse's Benjamin Franklin (1889), John Adams (1885), and Thomas\r\nJefferson (1883); Theodore Roosevelt's Gouverneur Morris, (1888). Other\r\nreadable volumes are P. L. Ford's The True George Washington (1896) and\r\nThe Many-sided Franklin (1899); F. S. Oliver's Alexander Hamilton, An\r\nEssay on American Union (New ed. London, 1907); W. G. Brown's Life\r\nof Oliver Ellsworth (1905); A. McL. Hamilton's The Intimate Life of\r\nAlexander Hamilton (1910); James Schouler's Thomas Jefferson (1893);\r\nGaillard Hunt's Life of James Madison (1902).\r\n\r\nOf the collections of documents it may be worth while to notice:\r\nDocumentary History of the Constitution of the United States, 5 vols.\r\n(1894-1905); B. P. Poore's Federal and State Constitutions, Colonial\r\nCharters, etc., 2 vols. (1877); F. N. Thorpe's The Federal and State\r\nConstitutions, Colonial Charters, and other Organic Laws, 7 vols.\r\n(1909); and the Journals of the Continental Congress (1904-1914), edited\r\nfrom the original records in the Library of Congress by Worthington C.\r\nFord and Gaillard Hunt, of which 23 volumes have appeared, bringing the\r\nrecords down through 1782.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES ON THE PORTRAITS OF MEMBERS OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION WHO SIGNED\r\nTHE CONSTITUTION By Victor Hugo Paltsis\r\n\r\nForty signatures were attached to the Constitution of the United\r\nStates in the Federal Convention on September 17, 1787, by thirty-nine\r\ndelegates, representing twelve States, and the secretary of the\r\nConvention, as the attesting officer. George Washington, who signed as\r\npresident of the Convention, was a delegate from Virginia. There\r\nare reproduced in this volume the effigies or pretended effigies\r\nof thirty-seven of them, from etchings by Albert Rosenthal in an\r\nextra-illustrated volume devoted to the Members of the Federal\r\nConvention, 1787, in the Thomas Addis Emmet Collection owned by the\r\nNew York Public Library. The autographs are from the same source. This\r\nseries presents no portraits of David Brearley of New Jersey, Thomas\r\nFitzsimons of Pennsylvania, and Jacob Broom of Delaware. With respect\r\nto the others we give such information as Albert Rosenthal, the\r\nPhiladelphia artist, inscribed on each portrait and also such other data\r\nas have been unearthed from the correspondence of Dr. Emmet, preserved\r\nin the Manuscript Division of the New York Public Library.\r\n\r\nConsiderable controversy has raged, on and off, but especially of late,\r\nin regard to the painted and etched portraits which Rosenthal produced\r\nnearly a generation ago, and in particular respecting portraits which\r\nwere hung in Independence Hall, Philadelphia. Statements in the case\r\nby Rosenthal and by the late Charles Henry Hart are in the American\r\nArt News, March 3, 1917, p. 4. See also Hart's paper on bogus\r\nAmerican portraits in Annual Report, 1913, of the American Historical\r\nAssociation. To these may be added some interesting facts which are not\r\nsufficiently known by American students.\r\n\r\nIn the ninth decade of the nineteenth century, principally from 1885\r\nto 1888, a few collectors of American autographs united in an informal\r\nassociation which was sometimes called a \"Club,\" for the purpose of\r\nprocuring portraits of American historical characters which they desired\r\nto associate with respective autographs as extra-illustrations. They\r\nwere pioneers in their work and their purposes were honorable. They\r\ncoöperated in effort and expenses, in a most commendable mutuality.\r\nPrime movers and workers were the late Dr. Emmet, of New York, and Simon\r\nGratz, Esq., still active in Philadelphia. These men have done much\r\nto stimulate appreciation for and the preservation of the fundamental\r\nsources of American history. When they began, and for many years\r\nthereafter, not the same critical standards reigned among American\r\nhistorians, much less among American collectors, as the canons\r\nnow require. The members of the \"Club\" entered into an extensive\r\ncorrespondence with the descendants of persons whose portraits they\r\nwished to trace and then have reproduced. They were sometimes misled\r\nby these descendants, who themselves, often great-grandchildren or more\r\nremoved by ties and time, assumed that a given portrait represented the\r\nparticular person in demand, because in their own uncritical minds a\r\ntradition was as good as a fact.\r\n\r\nThe members of the \"Club,\" then, did the best they could with the\r\nassistance and standards of their time. The following extract from a\r\nletter written by Gratz to Emmet, November 10, 1885, reveals much that\r\nshould be better known. He wrote very frankly as follows: \"What you say\r\nin regard to Rosenthal's work is correct: but the fault is not his. Many\r\nof the photographs are utterly wanting in expression or character; and\r\nif the artist were to undertake to correct these deficiencies by making\r\nthe portrait what he may suppose it should be, his production (while\r\npresenting a better appearance artistically) might be very much less\r\nof a likeness than the photograph from which he works. Rosenthal always\r\nshows me a rough proof of the unfinished etching, so that I may advise\r\nhim as to corrections & additions which I may consider justifiable &\r\nadvisable.\"\r\n\r\nOther correspondence shows that Rosenthal received about twenty dollars\r\nfor each plate which he etched for the \"Club.\"\r\n\r\nThe following arrangement of data follows the order of the names as\r\nsigned to the Constitution. The Emmet numbers identify the etchings in\r\nthe bound volume from which they have been reproduced.\r\n\r\n1. George Washington, President (also delegate from Virginia), Emmet\r\n9497, inscribed \"Joseph Wright Pinxit Phila. 1784. Albert Rosenthal\r\nPhila. 1888. Aqua fortis.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW HAMPSHIRE\r\n\r\n2. John Langdon, Emmet 9439, inscribed \"Etched by Albert Rosenthal\r\nPhila. 1888 after Painting by Trumbull.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Walter Langdon, of Hyde Park, N. Y., in January, 1885, sent to Dr.\r\nEmmet a photograph of a \"portrait of Governor John Langdon LL.D.\" An oil\r\nminiature painted on wood by Col. John Trumbull, in 1792, is in the Yale\r\nSchool of Fine Arts. There is also painting of Langdon in Independence\r\nHall, by James Sharpless.\r\n\r\n3. Nicholas Gilman, Emmet 9441, inscribed \"Etched by Albert Rosenthal\r\nPhila. 1888.\" A drawing by the same artist formerly hung in Independence\r\nHall. The two are not at all alike. No contemporary attribution is made\r\nand the Emmet correspondence reveals nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTS\r\n\r\n4. Nathaniel Gorham, Emmet 9443. It was etched by Albert Rosenthal but\r\nwithout inscription of any kind or date. A painting by him, in likeness\r\nidentical, formerly hung in Independence Hall. No evidence in Emmet\r\ncorrespondence.\r\n\r\n5. Rufus King, Emmet 9445, inscribed \"Etched by Albert Rosenthal Phila.\r\n1888 after Painting by Trumbull.\" King was painted by Col. John Trumbull\r\nfrom life and the portrait is in the Yale School of Fine Arts. Gilbert\r\nStuart painted a portrait of King and there is one by Charles Willson\r\nPeale in Independence Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONNECTICUT\r\n\r\n6. William Samuel Johnson, Emmet 9447, inscribed \"Etched by Albert\r\nRosenthal Phila. 1888 from Painting by Gilbert Stuart.\" A painting by\r\nRosenthal after Stuart hung in Independence Hall. Stuart's portrait of\r\nDr. Johnson \"was one of the first, if not the first, painted by Stuart\r\nafter his return from England.\" Dated on back 1792. Also copied by\r\nGraham.--Mason, Life of Stuart, 208.\r\n\r\n7. Roger Sherman, Emmet 9449, inscribed \"Etched by Albert Rosenthal\r\nPhila. 1888 after Painting by Earle.\" The identical portrait copied by\r\nThomas Hicks, after Ralph Earle, is in Independence Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW YORK\r\n\r\n8. Alexander Hamilton, Emmet 9452, inscribed \"Etched by Albert Rosenthal\r\n1888 after Trumbull.\" A full length portrait, painted by Col. John\r\nTrumbull, is in the City Hall, New York. Other Hamilton portraits by\r\nTrumbull are in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, the Boston\r\nMuseum of Art, and in private possession.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW JERSEY\r\n\r\n9. William Livingston, Emmet 9454, inscribed \"Etched by Albert Rosenthal\r\nPhila., 1888.\" A similar portrait, painted by Rosenthal, formerly hung\r\nin Independence Hall. No correspondence relating to it is in the Emmet\r\nCollection.\r\n\r\n10. David Brearley. There is no portrait. Emmet 9456 is a drawing of a\r\nBrearley coat-of-arms taken from a book-plate.\r\n\r\n11. William Paterson, Emmet 9458, inscribed \"Albert Rosenthal Phila.\r\n1888.\" A painted portrait by an unknown artist was hung in Independence\r\nHall. The Emmet correspondence reveals nothing.\r\n\r\n12. Jonathan Dayton, Emmet 9460, inscribed \"Albert Rosenthal.\" A\r\npainting by Rosenthal also formerly hung in Independence Hall. The two\r\nare dissimilar. The etching is a profile, but the painting is nearly a\r\nfull-face portrait. The Emmet correspondence reveals no evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\nPENNSYLVANIA\r\n\r\n13. Benjamin Franklin, Emmet 9463, inscribed \"C. W. Peale Pinxit. Albert\r\nRosenthal Sc.\"\r\n\r\n14. Thomas Mifflin, Emmet 9466, inscribed \"Etched by Albert Rosenthal\r\nPhila. 1888 after Painting by Gilbert Stuart.\" A portrait by Charles\r\nWillson Peale, in civilian dress, is in Independence Hall. The Stuart\r\nportrait shows Mifflin in military uniform.\r\n\r\n15. Robert Morris, Emmet 9470, inscribed \"Gilbert Stuart Pinxit. Albert\r\nRosenthal Sc.\" The original painting is in the Historical Society of\r\nPennsylvania. Stuart painted Morris in 1795. A copy was owned by the\r\nlate Charles Henry Hart; a replica also existed in the possession of\r\nMorris's granddaughter.--Mason, Life of Stuart, 225.\r\n\r\n16. George Clymer, Emmet 9475, inscribed \"Etched by Albert Rosenthal\r\nPhila. 1888 after Painting by C. W. Peale.\" There is a similar type\r\nportrait, yet not identical, in Independence Hall, where the copy was\r\nattributed to Dalton Edward Marchant.\r\n\r\n17. Thomas Fitzsimons. There is no portrait and the Emmet correspondence\r\noffers no information.\r\n\r\n18. Jared Ingersoll, Emmet 9468, inscribed \"Etched by Albert Rosenthal\r\nafter Painting by C. W. Peale.\" A portrait of the same origin, said to\r\nhave been copied by George Lambdin, \"after Rembrandt Peale,\" hung in\r\nIndependence Hall.\r\n\r\n19. James Wilson, Emmet 9472, inscribed \"Etched by Albert Rosenthal\r\n1888.\" Seems to have been derived from a painting by Charles Willson\r\nPeale in Independence Hall.\r\n\r\n20. Gouverneur Morris, Emmet 9477, inscribed \"Etched by Albert Rosenthal\r\nPhila. 1888 after a copy by Marchant from Painting by T. Sully.\" The\r\nEmmet correspondence has no reference to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nDELAWARE\r\n\r\n21. George Read, Emmet 9479, inscribed \"Etched by Albert Rosenthal\r\nPhila. 1888.\" There is in Emmet 9481 a stipple plate \"Engraved by J. B.\r\nLongacre from a Painting by Pine.\" It is upon the Longacre-Pine portrait\r\nthat Rosenthal and others, like H. B. Hall, have depended for their\r\nportrait of Read.\r\n\r\n22. Gunning Bedford, Jr., Emmet 9483, inscribed \"Etched by Albert\r\nRosenthal Phila. 1888.\" Rosenthal also painted a portrait, \"after\r\nCharles Willson Peale,\" for Independence Hall. The etching is the same\r\nportrait. On May 13, 1883, Mr. Simon Gratz wrote to Dr. Emmet: \"A very\r\nfair lithograph can, I think, be made from the photograph of Gunning\r\nBedford, Jun.; which I have just received from you. I shall call the\r\nartist's attention to the excess of shadow on the cravat.\" The source\r\nwas a photograph furnished by the Bedford descendants.\r\n\r\n23. John Dickinson, Emmet 9485, inscribed \"Etched by Albert Rosenthal\r\nPhila. 1888 after Painting by C. W. Peale.\" The Peale painting is in\r\nIndependence Hall.\r\n\r\n24. Richard Bassett, Emmet 9487, inscribed \"Albert Rosenthal.\" There\r\nwas also a painting by Rosenthal in Independence Hall. While similar in\r\ntype, they are not identical. They vary in physiognomy and arrangement\r\nof hair. There is nothing in the Emmet correspondence about this\r\nportrait.\r\n\r\n25. Jacob Broom. There is no portrait and no information in the Emmet\r\ncorrespondence.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARYLAND\r\n\r\n26. James McHenry, Emmet 9490, inscribed \"Etched by Albert Rosenthal\r\nPhila. 1888.\" Rosenthal also painted a portrait for Independence\r\nHall \"after Saint-Memin.\" They are not alike. The etching faces\r\nthree-quarters to the right, whilst the St. Memin is a profile portrait.\r\nIn January, 1885, Henry F. Thompson, of Baltimore, wrote to Dr. Emmet:\r\n\"If you wish them, you can get Portraits and Memoirs of James McHenry\r\nand John E. Howard from their grandson J. Howard McHenry whose address\r\nis No. 48 Mount Vernon Place, Baltimore.\"\r\n\r\n27. Daniel of St. Thomas Jenifer, Emmet 9494, inscribed \"Etched by\r\nAlbert Rosenthal Phila. 1888 after Trumbull.\" Rosenthal also painted a\r\nportrait for Independence Hall. They are not identical. A drawn visage\r\nis presented in the latter. In January, 1885, Henry F. Thompson of\r\nBaltimore, wrote to Dr. Emmet: \"Mr. Daniel Jenifer has a Portrait of\r\nhis Grand Uncle Daniel of St. Thomas Jenifer and will be glad to make\r\narrangements for you to get a copy of it.... His address is No. 281\r\nLinden Ave, Baltimore.\" In June, of the same year, Simon Gratz wrote to\r\nEmmet: \"The Dan. of St. Thos. Jenifer is so bad, that I am almost afraid\r\nto give it to Rosenthal. Have you a better photograph of this man (from\r\nthe picture in Washington [sic.]), spoken of in one of your letters?\"\r\n\r\n28. Daniel Carroll, Emmet 9492, inscribed \"Etched by Albert Rosenthal,\r\nPhila. 1888.\" Henry F. Thompson, of Baltimore, in January, 1885, wrote\r\nto Dr. Emmet: \"If you will write to Genl. John Carroll No. 61 Mount\r\nVernon Place you can get a copy of Mr. Carroll's (generally known as\r\nBarrister Carroll) Portrait.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVIRGINIA\r\n\r\n29. John Blair, Emmet 9500, inscribed \"Albert Rosenthal Etcher.\" He also\r\npainted a portrait for Independence Hall. The two are of the same type\r\nbut not alike. The etching is a younger looking picture. There is no\r\nevidence in the Emmet correspondence.\r\n\r\n30. James Madison, Jr., Emmet 9502, inscribed \"Etched by Albert\r\nRosenthal Phila. 1888 after Painting by G. Stuart.\" Stuart painted\r\nseveral paintings of Madison, as shown in Mason, Life of Stuart, pp.\r\n218-9. Possibly the Rosenthal etching was derived from the picture in\r\nthe possession of the Coles family of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTH CAROLINA\r\n\r\n31. William Blount, Emmet 9504, inscribed \"Etched by Albert Rosenthal\r\nPhila. 1888.\" He also painted a portrait for Independence Hall. The two\r\nare alike. In November, 1885, Moses White, of Knoxville, Tenn., wrote\r\nthus: \"Genl. Marcus J. Wright, published, last year, a life of Win.\r\nBlount, which contains a likeness of him.... This is the only likeness\r\nof Gov. Blount that I ever saw.\" This letter was written to Mr. Bathurst\r\nL. Smith, who forwarded it to Dr. Emmet.\r\n\r\n32. Richard Dobbs Spaight, Emmet 9506, inscribed \"Etched by Albert\r\nRosenthal Phila. 1887.\" In Independence Hall is a portrait painted by\r\nJames Sharpless. On comparison these two are of the same type but not\r\nalike. The etching presents an older facial appearance. On November 8,\r\n1886, Gen. John Meredith Read, writing from Paris, said he had found in\r\nthe possession of his friend in Paris, J. R. D. Shepard, \"St. Memin's\r\nengraving of his great-grandfather Governor Spaight of North Carolina.\"\r\nIn 1887 and 1888, Dr. Emmet and Mr. Gratz were jointly interested in\r\nhaving Albert Rosenthal engrave for them a portrait of Spaight. On\r\nDecember 9, 1887, Gratz wrote to Emmet: \"Spaight is worthy of being\r\netched; though I can scarcely agree with you that our lithograph is\r\nnot a portrait of the M. O. C. Is it taken from the original Sharpless\r\nportrait, which hangs in our old State House? ... However if you are\r\nsure you have the right man in the photograph sent, we can afford to\r\nignore the lithograph.\"\r\n\r\n33. Hugh Williamson, Emmet 9508, inscribed \"Etched by Albert Rosenthal\r\nafter Painting by J. Trumbull Phila. 1888,\" Rosenthal also painted\r\na copy \"after John Wesley Jarvis\" for Independence Hall. The two are\r\nundoubtedly from the same original source. The Emmet correspondence\r\npresents no information on this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTH CAROLINA\r\n\r\n34. John Rutledge, Emmet 9510, inscribed \"Etched by Albert Rosenthal\r\nPhila. 1888 after J. Trumbull.\" The original painting was owned by the\r\nMisses Rutledge, of Charleston, S. C.\r\n\r\n35. Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, Emmet 9512, inscribed \"Etched by Albert\r\nRosenthal Phila. 1888. Painting by Trumbull.\" An oil miniature on wood\r\nwas painted by Col. John Trumbull, in 1791, which is in the Yale School\r\nof Fine Arts. Pinckney was also painted by Gilbert Stuart and the\r\nportrait was owned by the family at Runnymeade, S. C. Trumbull's\r\nportrait shows a younger face.\r\n\r\n36. Charles Pinckney, Emmet 9514, inscribed \"Etched by Albert Rosenthal\r\nPhila. 1888.\" He also painted a portrait for Independence Hall. They are\r\nalike. In the Emmet correspondence the following information, furnished\r\nto Dr. Emmet, is found: \"Chas. Pinckney--Mr. Henry L. Pinckney of\r\nStateburg [S. C.] has a picture of Gov. Pinckney.\" The owner of this\r\nportrait was a grandson of the subject. On January 12, 1885, P. G.\r\nDe Saussure wrote to Emmet: \"Half an hour ago I received from the\r\nPhotographer two of the Pictures [one being] Charles Pinckney copied\r\nfrom a portrait owned by Mr. L. Pinckney--who lives in Stateburg, S. C.\"\r\nThe owner had put the portrait at Dr. Emmet's disposal, in a letter of\r\nDecember 4, 1884, in which he gave its dimensions as \"about 3 ft. nearly\r\nsquare,\" and added, \"it is very precious to me.\"\r\n\r\n37. Pierce Butler, Emmet 9516, inscribed \"Etched by Albert Rosenthal\r\nPhila. 1888.\" He also painted a portrait for Independence Hall. They are\r\ndissimilar and dubious. Three letters in the Emmet correspondence refer\r\nto the Butler portraiture. On January 31, 1887, Mrs. Sarah B. Wister,\r\nof Philadelphia, wrote to Dr. Emmet: \"I enclose photograph copies of\r\ntwo miniatures of Maj. Butler wh. Mr. Louis Butler [a bachelor then over\r\nseventy years old living in Paris, France] gave me not long ago: I did\r\nnot know of their existence until 1882, & never heard of any likeness of\r\nmy great-grandfather, except an oil-portrait wh. was last seen more\r\nthan thirty years ago in a lumber room in his former house at the n. w.\r\ncorner of 8th & Chestnut streets [Phila.], since then pulled down.\"\r\nOn February 8th, Mrs. Wister wrote: \"I am not surprised that the two\r\nminiatures do not strike you as being of the same person. Yet I believe\r\nthere is no doubt of it; my cousin had them from his father who was Maj.\r\nButler's son. The more youthful one is evidently by a poor artist, &\r\ntherefore probably was a poor likeness.\" In her third letter to Dr.\r\nEmmet, on April 5, 1888, Mrs. Wister wrote: \"I sent you back the photo.\r\nfrom the youthful miniature of Maj. Butler & regret very much that I\r\nhave no copy of the other left; but four sets were made of wh. I sent\r\nyou one & gave the others to his few living descendants. I regret\r\nthis all the more as I am reluctant to trust the miniature again to\r\na photographer. I live out of town so that there is some trouble in\r\nsending & calling for them; (I went personally last time, & there are no\r\nother likenesses of my great grandfather extant.)\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGIA\r\n\r\n38. William Few, Emmet 9518, inscribed \"Etched by Albert Rosenthal\r\nPhila. 1888.\" He also painted a portrait \"after John Ramage,\" for\r\nIndependence Hall. They are identical.\r\n\r\n39. Abraham Baldwin, Emmet 9520, inscribed \"Etched by Albert Rosenthal\r\nPhila. 1888.\" There is also a painting \"after Fulton\" in Independence\r\nHall. They are of the same type but not exactly alike, yet likely from\r\nthe same original. The variations may be just artist's vagaries. There\r\nis no information in the Emmet correspondence.\r\n\r\n40. William Jackson, Secretary, Emmet 9436, inscribed \"Etched by Albert\r\nRosenthal Phila. 1888 after Painting by J. Trumbull.\" Rosenthal also\r\npainted a copy after Trumbull for Independence Hall. They are identical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX A Adams, John, on American Peace Commission, 9 et seq.; personal\r\ncharacteristics, 10; negotiates commerical treaty with the Netherlands,\r\n11; on fisheries question, 13-14; on settlement of commercial\r\nindebtedness, 14-15; on granting compensation to Loyalists, 20;\r\ncomplains of trade restriction for New England, 26.

The\r\ndocuments were produced as typed in the paper book, with the exception\r\nof the signers of the document. The book had two signatures per line; we\r\nused one signature per line to allow for better formatting across e-book\r\npresentations. We transcribed the left column first, from top to bottom,\r\nand then the right column in the same manner. No other amendments were\r\nintentionally made to these four documents, which are facsimiles of\r\nthe actual documents as supervised by author and noted constitutional\r\nhistorian Max Farrand.\r\n\r\nObvious errors in the rest of the text have been corrected, and are\r\nlisted below:\r\n\r\nPage 53: Remove period after United States because the sentence\r\ncontinues with 'under their direction.\"' on Page 54.",
