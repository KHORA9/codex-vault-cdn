C. Bancroft Davis and the Honorable William\r\nA. Richardson, I am venturing upon the task of giving a sketch of my\r\nexperiences in life during three fourths of a century.  The wisdom of\r\nsuch an undertaking is not outside the realm of debate.  A large part\r\nof my manhood has been spent in the politics of my native state, and\r\nin the politics of the country.  For many years I have had the fortune\r\nto be associated with those in whose hands the chief powers were\r\nlodged.  I have been a witness of, and in some cases an actor in,\r\nevents that have changed the character of the institutions and affected\r\nthe fortunes of the country.  Those events and their consequences must\r\nin time disturb, if they do not change, the institutions of other\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this long period I have had opportunities to know\r\nsome of the principal actors in those important events.  In a few\r\ncases I am in possession of knowledge not now in the possession of any\r\nother person living.  These considerations may in some degree justify\r\nmy undertaking.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand I have not kept a record of events, and I have had\r\noccasion often, especially in the practice of my profession, to notice\r\nthe imperfections of the human memory.  Much that I shall write must\r\ndepend upon the fidelity of that faculty, although in some cases my\r\nrecollections may be verified or corrected by the public records.\r\n\r\nThe recollections of actors, when those recollections are reported in\r\ngood faith, constitute quite as safe a basis for an historical\r\njudgment as do the diaries in which are noted present impressions.\r\nUsually the writer of a diary has only an imperfect knowledge of the\r\nsubject to which the entries relate.  If he is himself an actor in\r\npassing events he makes and leaves a record colored and perhaps tainted\r\nby the personal and political passions of the times.  The teachings of\r\nexperience and that more moderate view of events, which we sometimes\r\ncall philosophy and sometimes the wisdom of age, may warrant the\r\nstudent and the historian in giving credence to mere recollections.\r\n\r\nThe writer of a diary takes little note of the importance of the events\r\nto which the entries relate.  Persons and events become important or\r\ncease to be important by the progress of time, but the life of an\r\nindividual is an adequate period usually for the formation of a\r\njudgment.  I cannot assume that it will be my fortune to make a wise\r\nselection in all cases.  Important events may be omitted, insignificant\r\ncircumstances may be recorded.\r\n\r\nI assume that my family and friends will take an interest in matters\r\nthat are purely personal:  therefore I shall record many incidents and\r\nevents that do not concern the public.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH\r\n\r\n_PRELIMINARY NOTE\r\n\r\nIn the presence of some misgivings as to the propriety of my course, I\r\nhave decided to print the article on my Life as a Lawyer, as it appears\r\nin the \"Memoirs of the Judiciary and the Bar of New England\" (for\r\nJanuary, 1901), published by the Century Memorial Publishing Company,\r\nBoston, Mass.\r\n\r\nMany of the facts were furnished by me.  The article was written by W.\r\nStanley Child, Esq., but it was not seen by me, nor was its existence\r\nknown to me until it appeared in the published work.  The paper in\r\nmanuscript and in proof was read and passed by the editors, Messrs.\r\nConrad Keno and Leonard A. Jones, Esquires.  The words of commendation\r\nare not mine, and it is manifest that any change made by me would place\r\nthe responsibility upon me for what might remain.  Hence I reprint the\r\npaper with only two or three changes where I have observed errors in\r\nstatements of facts._\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH [*]\r\n\r\nGeorge Sewall Boutwell, LL. D., Boston and Groton, the first\r\ncommissioner of internal revenue, secretary of the treasury under\r\nPresident Grant, and for many years one of the leading international\r\nlawyers, is the son of Sewall and Rebecca (Marshall) Boutwell, and was\r\nborn in Brookline, Mass., in what is now the old part of the Country\r\nClub house, January 28, 1818.  He comes from old and respected\r\nMassachusetts stock, being a lineal descendant of James Boutwell, who\r\nwas admitted a freeman in Lynn in 1638, and of John Marshall, who\r\ncame to Boston in the shop _Hopewell_ in 1634.  The family has always\r\nrepresented the sterling qualities of typical New Englanders.\r\nTradition asserts that one of his paternal ancestors received a grant\r\nof land for services in King Philip's War.  His maternal grandfather,\r\nJacob Marshall, was the inventor of the cotton press, an invention\r\noriginally made, however, for pressing hops.  His father, Sewall\r\nBoutwell, removed with his family in 1820 from Brookline to Lunenburg,\r\nMass., where he held several town offices; he was a member of the\r\nMassachusetts House of Representatives in 1843 and 1844 and of the\r\nConstitutional Convention of 1853.\r\n\r\nMr. Boutwell attended in his early years a public school in Lunenburg,\r\nwhere he became a clerk in a general store at the age of thirteen, thus\r\ngaining a practical as well as a theoretical knowledge of affairs.\r\nLater he supplemented this experience by teaching school at Shirley.\r\nHe also studied the classics, and in various ways improved every\r\nopportunity for advancement which limited circumstances afforded.  In\r\n1835 he went to Groton, Mass., as clerk in a store.  But to be a\r\nlawyer was his dream before he had ever seen a lawyer.  Endowed with\r\nunusual intellectual ability, which has been one of his chief\r\ncharacteristics from boyhood, he felt himself instinctively drawn to\r\nthe legal profession, and as early as possible entered his name as\r\na student at law.\r\n\r\nIn 1839 he was chosen a member of the Groton School Committee, and\r\nin 1840 he was an active Democrat, advocating the re-election of\r\nMartin Van Buren to the Presidency.  In the meantime he delivered a\r\nnumber of important lectures and political speeches, his first lecture\r\nbeing given before the Groton Lyceum when he was nineteen, and he was\r\nnow rapidly gaining a reputation in public affairs, in which he early\r\ntook a deep interest.  In January, 1842, he became a member of the\r\nlower House of the Massachusetts Legislature from Groton, and for ten\r\nyears thereafter his law studies were neglected.  He served during the\r\nsessions of 1842, 1843, 1844, 1847, 1848, 1849 and 1850, and was also\r\nat different times a railroad commissioner, a bank commissioner, and a\r\nmember of various other commissions of the commonwealth.\r\n\r\nAs a member of the House he made many important arguments that were\r\nlegal in name if not in fact.  One related to the Act of the\r\nLegislature of 1843, by which the salaries of the judges were reduced,\r\nand another upon a bill for the amendment of the charter of Harvard\r\nCollege.  On the latter question, which was in controversy for three\r\nyears, his opponents were Judge Benjamin R. Curtis and Hon. Samuel\r\nHoar.\r\n\r\nMr. Boutwell originated the movement for a change in the college\r\ngovernment, which was effected by a compromise in 1851.  Chief Justice\r\nLemuel Shaw, a member of the corporation, wrote an answer to his\r\nargument.  This led to Mr. Boutwell's appointment in 1851 as a member\r\nof the Harvard College Board of Overseers, which position he filled\r\nuntil 1860.  In January, 1851, he became Governor of Massachusetts by\r\na fusion of the Democratic and Free-soil members of the Legislature,\r\nand in 1852 was re-elected by the same body.  He served in that\r\ncapacity until January, 1853, a period of two years, and discharged\r\nthe duties of the office with ability, dignity, and honor.  As a\r\nmember of the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention of 1853, Mr.\r\nBoutwell had further and better opportunities to make the acquaintance\r\nand to observe the ways of the leading lawyers of the State.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the Constitutional Convention of 1853, Governor\r\nBoutwell entered the law office of Joel Giles, who was engaged in\r\npractice under the patent laws, and who as a mechanic and lawyer was\r\na well-equipped practitioner in Boston.  As a counselor in patent cases\r\nMr. Giles had few equals.  It was then Mr. Boutwell's purpose to pursue\r\nthe study and engage in the practice of the patent laws as a specialty,\r\nbut in October, 1855, without any solicitation and indeed without the\r\nslightest knowledge on his part, he was chosen secretary of the\r\nMassachusetts Board of Education, of which he had been a member from\r\n1853.  With much uncertainty as to the wisdom of his action in\r\naccepting the place, he entered upon his duties and faithfully and\r\nefficiently discharged them until January 1, 1861, although he had\r\ntendered his resignation in 1859.  His annual reports have always been\r\nregarded as models of preparation, and that of 1861--the twenty-fourth\r\n--contains a notable commentary on the school laws of the commonwealth.\r\nHe continued as a member of the board until 1863.\r\n\r\nAfter several years Mr. Boutwell severed his relations with Mr. Giles,\r\nand upon his admission to the Suffolk bar in January, 1862, on motion\r\nof the late Judge Josiah Gardner Abbott, he began active practice in\r\nBoston.  His first jury case was before the late Judge Charles Allen,\r\nof Worcester, yet at that time he had never seen a jury trial from the\r\nopening to the close.  Mr. Boutwell had scarcely entered upon his\r\nprofessional career when he was called to assume a most important place\r\nin national affairs, and one that was destined to keep him in close\r\nrelations with the Federal Government at Washington for many years\r\nafterward.\r\n\r\nAmong the historical events, originating in the Civil War, was the\r\npassage of the act \"to provide internal revenue to support the\r\ngovernment and to pay interest on the public debt,\" approved July 1,\r\n1862.  Mr. Boutwell organized the Office of Internal Revenue and was\r\nthe first internal revenue commissioner, receiving his appointment\r\nwhile at Cairo in the service of the War Department.  He arrived in\r\nWashington July 16, and entered upon his duties the following day.\r\nWithin a few days the Secretary of the Treasury assigned him a single\r\nclerk, then a second, and afterward a third, and the clerical force was\r\nincreased from time to time until at his resignation of the office of\r\ncommissioner on March 3, 1863, it numbered 140 persons.  To him is due\r\nits organization upon a basis which has more than fulfilled the most\r\ncherished hopes and expectations of those who conceived the idea and\r\nwhich has furnished from the first a valuable source of revenue for\r\nthe government with little hardship or unnecessary friction among the\r\npeople at large.  The stamp tax took effect nominally on the 1st of\r\nOctober, 1862, less than two and one-half months after Mr. Boutwell\r\nentered upon his duties as commissioner, yet before he resigned, five\r\nmonths later, he had the office so well established, and its work so\r\nthoroughly organized throughout the United States, that its usefulness\r\nwas assured and it has continued to the present time practically the\r\nsame lines that he laid down.  In July, 1863, three months after he\r\nretired from the office, he published a volume of 500 pages, entitled\r\n\"A Manual of the Direct and Excise Tax System of the United States,\"\r\nwhich included the act itself, the forms and regulations established\r\nby him, his decisions and rulings, extracts from the correspondence of\r\nthe office, and much other valuable information bearing on the subject.\r\nThis work has ever been accepted as authority, and still forms the\r\nbasis of the government of the internal revenue system.\r\n\r\nBefore Mr. Boutwell was admitted to the bar he was retained by the\r\ncounty commissioners of Middlesex County to appear before a\r\nlegislative committee of the years 1854 and 1855 against the division\r\nof that county and the erection of a new county to be called the county\r\nof Webster with Fitchburg for the shire.  Emory Washburn appeared for\r\nWorcester County and Rufus Choate for Fitchburg and the new county.\r\nThe application failed in 1855 and again in 1856.  Mr. Boutwell's\r\narguments on this petition, made March 25, 1855, and April 23, 1856,\r\nwere remarkable for power and eloquence, and largely influenced the\r\nfinal result.\r\n\r\nFrom 1862 to 1869 he was retained in many causes, the most important\r\nof which was the controversy over the contract between the commonwealth\r\nand Gen. Herman Haupt for the construction of the Hoosac Tunnel.  The\r\nhearing before a legislative committee occupied about twenty days and\r\nended in the annulment of the contract.  For several years Mr. Boutwell\r\nwas associated in Boston with J. Q. A. Griffin.  Afterward he was in\r\npartnership with Henry F. French until 1869, when he became Secretary\r\nof the Treasury in the Cabinet of President Grant.  He filled this\r\nposition with great ability for four years, originating and\r\npromulgating, among other measures, the plan of refunding the public\r\ndebt.  During that period he made but one argument, when he appeared\r\nin the Supreme Court on the appeal by his client of a patent case, of\r\nwhich he had had charge from the beginning.  From 1863 to 1869 he had\r\nbeen a member of the 38th, 39th, 40th and 41st Congresses, serving on\r\nthe committees on the judiciary and on reconstruction, and being\r\nchairman for a time of the latter body.  While representing his\r\ndistrict in Congress Mr. Boutwell gained considerable experience in\r\nthe proceedings against President Andrew Johnson, who was impeached for\r\nhigh crimes and misdemeanors, and he was selected as one of the\r\nmanagers on the part of the House.  In a remarkably brilliant speech\r\nbefore the House on December 5 and 6, 1867, he maintained the doctrine\r\nthat the president and all other civil officers could be impeached for\r\nacts that were not indictable, although the contrary was held by many\r\neminent lawyers, including President Dwight, of Columbia College, who\r\nwrote a treatise in support of his theory.  But the House preferred\r\narticles that did not allege an indictable offence and the Senate\r\nsustained them by a vote of thirty-five to eighteen, one less than the\r\nnumber necessary for conviction.  On April 22 and 23, 1868, Mr.\r\nBoutwell, on behalf of the managers, addressed the Senate, delivering\r\none of the strongest and ablest arguments on record, and thus\r\ncompleting, as a lawyer, the most exhaustive labor he ever attempted.\r\nHe was a member of the Committee of Fifteen which reported the\r\nFourteenth Amendment, and while serving on the committee on the\r\njudiciary he reported and carried through the House the Fifteenth\r\nAmendment to the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn 1873 Mr. Boutwell was chosen United States Senator from\r\nMassachusetts to fill the unexpired term of Hon. Henry Wilson, who had\r\nbeen elected Vice-President.  He continued in the Senate until 1877,\r\nwhen he was appointed by President Hayes, through Gen. Charles Devens,\r\nthen Attorney-General, commissioner to revise the statutes of the\r\nUnited States.  That great work was completed and the volume was\r\npublished in the autumn of 1878.  Some idea of the labor involved in\r\nthis undertaking may be gained from the index, which contains over\r\n25,000 references.  In 1878 Mr. Boutwell returned to Boston and resumed\r\nthe practice of law.  In 1880 William M. Evarts, then Secretary of\r\nState, and President Hayes, asked him to accept the position of counsel\r\nand agent for the United States before a Board of International\r\nArbitrators created by a treaty ratified in June, 1880, between the\r\nUnited States and France, for the settlement of claims against each\r\ngovernment by citizens of the other government.  The claims of French\r\ncitizens, 726 in number, arose from the operations of the Union armies\r\nin the South, principally in and around New Orleans, during the Civil\r\nWar, and the consideration of them occupied four years.  The counsel\r\nand the commissioners were called to the discussion of treaties, of\r\ninternational law, of citizenship, of the Legislation of France, of the\r\nrights of war, and of the conduct of military officers and military\r\ntribunals.  The claims amounted to $35,000,000, including interest; the\r\nrecoveries amount to about $625,000; the defence cost the Government\r\nabout $500,000; the record is contained in ninety printed volumes of\r\nabout one thousand pages each and the pleas and arguments of counsel\r\nfor the two governments fill eight large volumes.  Mr. Boutwell's own\r\narguments cover more than 1,100 pages.  Many of these cases rank as\r\n_causes celebre,_ notably those of Archbishop Joseph Napoleon Perche,\r\nNo. 3; Henri Dubos, No. 26; Joseph Bauillotte, No. 130; Bleze Motte,\r\nNo. 131; Theodore Valade, No. 214; Pierre S. Wiltz, No. 313; Remy\r\nJardel, No. 333; Etienne Derbee, No. 339; Arthur Vallon, No. 394;\r\nDavid Kuhnagel, No. 438; Dr. Denis Meng, No. 567; Azoline Gautherin,\r\nNo. 590; Oscar Chopin, No. 592; S. Aruns Sorrel, No. 594, in which he\r\nprobably made the best argument of his career; Jules Le More, No. 595;\r\nAthenais C. Le More, No. 598; Mary Ann Texier, No. 569; and Charles\r\nHeidsieck, No. 691.  That of Theodore Valade, No. 214, was a full\r\naccount of the battle of Donaldsonville, and those of Archbishop\r\nPerche, David Kuhnagel, and many other involved intricate and\r\ninteresting questions of citizenship as well as damages for the\r\ndestruction of property.  On May 10, 1884, Mr. Boutwell made an\r\nexhaustive and final report on all these claims to the Secretary of\r\nState, Hon. Frederick T. Frelinghuysen.\r\n\r\nMr. Boutwell was one of the counsel for the government of Hayti in the\r\ncelebrated case of Antonio Pelletier against that republic in 1885, and\r\nmade a most interesting oral argument.  This case was a romance of the\r\nsea as well as of international importance, involving a claim of\r\n$2,500,000 and questions of piracy and slave trading.  In 1893-94 Mr.\r\nBoutwell was retained as counsel on the part of Chili to defend their\r\ngovernment before an international commission created under a treaty\r\nwith the United States signed August 7, 1892.  About forty cases were\r\npresented, involving $26,300,000, and the final report was submitted\r\nApril 30, 1894.  Among the more important were those of Gilbert B.\r\nBorden, No. 9, and Frederick H. Lovett et al., No. 43, against the\r\nRepublic of Chili.  These as well as nearly all the others were argued\r\nby him with a brilliancy and eloquence that has marked his entire\r\ncareer at the bar.  Of the five courts martial that were held in\r\nWashington between 1880 and 1892 for the trial of officers of the army\r\nand navy Mr. Boutwell was retained for the defence in four cases, in\r\nthree of which the accused were convicted and in the other honorably\r\nacquitted.  In 1886 he was retained by the Mormon Church to appear\r\nbefore the judiciary committee of the House of Representatives against\r\nthe Edmunds bill, which was modified in particulars pointed out in the\r\ndiscussion.  The same year he appeared before the House committee on\r\nforeign affairs for the government of Hawaii in opposition to the\r\nproject for abrogating the treaty of 1875.\r\n\r\nMr. Boutwell's pleas and arguments have with few exceptions been\r\npublished in book or pamphlet form, or both, and form of themselves a\r\nmost valuable and interesting addition to legal literature.  They bear\r\nevidence of a profound knowledge of the law, of vast research and of\r\ngreat literary ability.  Among others may be mentioned those upon a\r\npetition to the Massachusetts Legislature for the removal of Joseph M.\r\nDay as judge of probate and insolvency for Barnstable County in March,\r\n1881; in the matter of the Pacific National Bank of Boston before the\r\nbanking and currency committee of the United State House of\r\nRepresentatives, March 22, 1884; and for the claimant in the case of\r\nthe Berdan Fire-Arms Manufacturing Company of New York vs. the United\r\nStates.  He is the author of \"Educational Topics and Institutions,\"\r\n1859; \"Speeches Relating to the Rebellion and the Overthrow of\r\nSlavery,\" collected and published in 1867; \"Why I am a Republican,\" a\r\nhistory of the Republican Party to 1884, republished in 1888; \"The\r\nLawyer, Statesman and Soldier,\" 1887; and the \"Constitution of the\r\nUnited States,\" embracing the substance of the leading decisions of the\r\nSupreme Court in which the several articles, sections and clauses have\r\nbeen examined, explained and interpreted, 1896.  In 1888 he wrote a\r\npamphlet on \"Protection as a Public Policy,\" for the American\r\nProtective Tariff League; on April 2, 1889, he read a paper on \"The\r\nProgress of American Independence,\" before the New York Historical\r\nSociety; and in February, 1896, he published a pamphlet on \"The\r\nVenezuelan Question and the Monroe Doctrine.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Boutwell has probably argued more cases involving international law\r\nthan any other living man, and in this department ranks among the\r\nablest and strongest that this country has ever produced.  For more\r\nthan forty years he was a prominent figure before the bar of the United\r\nStates Courts at Washington, where he achieved eminence as an advocate\r\nof the highest ability.  He was uniformly successful, and won a\r\nreputation which was not confined to this country.  He is an authority\r\non international and constitutional law.  His published writings stamp\r\nhim as a profound student of public questions and a man of rare\r\nliterary culture and genius.  He was a strong Abolitionist, and as\r\nlawyer, statesman and citizen he has faithfully and efficiently\r\nperformed his duties and won the confidence of both friends and\r\nopponents.  In politics he has been a leader of the Republican Party\r\nsince its organization.  He was a delegate to the Chicago Conventions\r\nof 1860 and 1880, and was chosen a delegate to the Baltimore\r\nConvention of 1864, but declined.  He was elected a member of the\r\nAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1857 and of the Phi Beta Kappa\r\nSociety of Harvard College in June, 1861, at which time he delivered\r\nthe Phi Beta Kappa oration.  In 1851 Harvard conferred upon him the\r\nhonorary degree of LL. D., and in 1861 he was a member of the Peace\r\nCongress at Washington.\r\n\r\nMr. Boutwell was married July 8, 1841, to Sarah Adelia, daughter of\r\nNathan Thayer of Hollis, N. H..  Their children are Georgianna A., born\r\nMay 18, 1843, and Francis M., born February 26, 1847.  Mr. Boutwell\r\nresides in Groton, Mass.\r\n\r\n_The eighth day of July, 1891, Mr. Boutwell's family and friends\r\ncelebrated the fiftieth anniversary of his marriage with Sarah Adelia\r\nThayer, daughter of Nathan and Hannah Jewett Thayer, of Hollis, N. H.;\r\nand on the eighth day of July, 1901, the family observed the sixtieth\r\nanniversary, but without ceremony, as Mrs. Boutwell was much impaired\r\nin health._\r\n\r\n[* Copyright, 1900, by the Mason Publishing and Printing Co.]\r\n\r\n\r\nREMINISCENCES\r\nOF\r\nSIXTY YEARS IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS\r\nVOLUME I\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\nINCIDENTS OF MY EARLY LIFE\r\n\r\nMy birthplace was at Brookline, Mass., near Boston, upon a farm in my\r\nfather's charge, and then owned by a Dr. Spooner of Boston.  The place\r\nhas had many owners and it has been used for various purposes.  In 1851\r\nand 1852 it was owned by a Dr. Trowbridge, who had a fancy for fine\r\nhorses.  Upon my election to the office of Governor, and when he had\r\nlearned that I was born upon his place, he insisted that I should use a\r\nlarge black stallion in the review of the troops at the annual parade.\r\nThe animal was of fine figure but not so subdued as to be manageable.\r\nIn one of those years General Wool came to Boston, upon an invitation\r\nto review the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company on Boston Common.\r\nI assigned the Trowbridge horse to General Wool.  The General rode him\r\nfor a minute or two, when he left the saddle and the reviewing officers\r\nwent through the ceremony on foot.  Since those days the Spooner place\r\nhas been converted into a trotting course known as Clyde Park, and the\r\nhouse is now used as a clubhouse by an association known as the Country\r\nClub.\r\n\r\nWhen I was about twenty-five years of age I was present at a temperance\r\nmeeting at Lowell, held in an unfinished factory building called the\r\nPrescott Mills.  After some speaking, in which I had taken a part, the\r\nRev. Dr. Pierce, then a white-headed gentleman of seventy years, whom\r\nI had seen as an overseer of Harvard College, came to me, introduced\r\nhimself, and after a little conversation he asked me where I was born.\r\nWhen I answered Brookline, on the Dr. Spooner place, he said:  \"Oh,\r\nyes, I remember when your father lived there, and I recall a\r\ncircumstance to which I think I owe my good health.  Dr. Spooner,\" said\r\nhe, \"resided in Boston in the winter and at Brookline in the summer.\r\nWhen he was at Brookline he had a child to be christened, and he\r\npreferred to have the city minister perform the ceremony.  After the\r\nservice we were invited to dine at Dr. Spooner's, and that minister ate\r\nso unmercifully of everything upon the table, that I then and there\r\nresolved that I would eat but one kind of meat at a meal, and I think\r\nmy good health is due in a measure to that resolution.\"  I made no\r\nresolution, but the circumstance produced an impression upon me, and in\r\nthe main I have observed his rule.  In seventy-seven years, within my\r\nrecollection, I have lain in bed but seven days.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1820, when I was hardly more than two years of age, my father\r\nmoved to Lunenburg, Worcester County, and settled upon a farm, a mile\r\nsouth-west of the village, which he had bought of Phinehas Carter, then\r\nan old man, who had been opulent as a farmer for the time and place,\r\nbut whose estates had been wasted by a moderate sort of intemperance,\r\nby idleness, and family expenses.  The house was large, well built for\r\nthe times, finished with clear, unpainted white pine, with dado work in\r\nthe front rooms below and in the chambers above.  It was situated on\r\nthe southern brow of a hill, and commanded a view of the Wachusett\r\nmountain, and the hills to the west, south and east over an expanse of\r\ntwenty miles in every direction, except the northern half of the\r\ncircle.  At a distance of eighty or one hundred rods from the house lay\r\nthe Whalom pond, a body of clear, deep spring water, of more than a\r\nhundred acres.  The farm contained one hundred and thirteen acres of\r\nland, somewhat rocky, but in quality better than the average New\r\nEngland farms.  At the time of the purchase one-half of the acres were\r\nwoodland with heavy timber.\r\n\r\nMy father relied upon that timber to meet the debt of one thousand\r\ndollars which rested upon the place.  In those days wood and timber\r\nwere abundant and money was scarce.  If the building of railroads could\r\nhave been foreseen and the timber saved for twenty-five years it would\r\nhave risen to twice the value of the farm at the time of the purchase.\r\nMy father's anxiety to be relieved of the debt was so great that he\r\nmade sales of wood and timber as he had the opportunity, but the\r\nproceeds, after much hard labor had been added, were very\r\ninsignificant.  As a result, the most valuable part of the timber was\r\nsold for ship-building, or to the coopers, or converted into boards\r\nand shingles, and a remnant of the debt remained for twenty years.\r\n\r\nThe farm yielded ample supplies of meat, milk, butter, cheese, grain,\r\nfruit, and vegetables, but groceries and clothing were difficult to\r\nprocure after such supplies were had as could be obtained by barter.\r\nOnce or twice, or possibly three times a year, my father drove an ox-\r\nteam or a team of one pair of oxen and one horse to Boston with cider,\r\napples, a hog or two, and poultry.  The returns enabled him to pay his\r\ntaxes, the interest on the debt, and perhaps something over.\r\n\r\nUntil the introduction of the cotton and woolen manufactures, and\r\nindeed, until the building of railways, the farmers of Massachusetts\r\nhad only limited means of comfort.  Their houses were destitute of\r\nfurniture, except of the plainest sort.  Of upholstered furniture they\r\nhad none.  Except a few school books for the children and the family\r\nBible there was no reading matter, unless in favored neighborhoods, a\r\nweekly paper carried the news to two or three families that were joint\r\nsubscribers.  The mails were infrequent, and the postage on letters,\r\nbased on the pieces of paper instead of weight, varied from six and one\r\nfourth cents for all distances within thirty miles to twenty-five cents\r\nfor distances of four hundred miles or more.  Intermediate rates were\r\nten, twelve and a half, and eighteen and three fourths cents.  These\r\nrates existed when mechanics could command only one dollar a day, and\r\nwhen ordinary laborers could earn only fifty cents or seventy-five\r\ncents--except in the haying season, when good mowers could command one\r\ndollar.  Servant girls and nurses received from one dollar to one\r\ndollar and fifty cents per week.  At the same time every variety of\r\nclothing was much more expensive than it now is, unless shoes and hats\r\nare exceptions.\r\n\r\nMy father was the best farmer in the neighborhood.  He had been\r\nemployed in the nursery and vegetable gardening at Newton, and for five\r\nyears he had had charge of the farm of Madam Coffin at Newton Corner,\r\nwidow of the Hon. Peleg Coffin, who had been a member of Congress from\r\nNantucket.  In a few years we had a supply of cherries, peaches, and\r\nchoice apples.  As my father understood budding and grafting tress, his\r\nimproved fruits were distributed to others.  I acquired the art of\r\nbudding when I could not have been more than ten years of age, and\r\nbefore I left home at the age of thirteen, I had practised the art in\r\nthe village and on the trees of the neighbors.\r\n\r\nPrevious to 1830 the era of invention had not opened, and the articles\r\nby whose aid domestic comfort has been promoted were unknown.  The only\r\nmeans of cooking were the open fire and the brick oven.  Meat for\r\nroasting was suspended by a cord from a hook in the ceiling in front of\r\nthe open fire and over a dripping pan.  The children found amusement\r\nand became useful in twisting the cord and then allowing the weight of\r\nthe meat to untwist it.  Even fire in the summer was obtained and kept\r\nwith difficulty.  There were no friction matches and not infrequently\r\na child was sent on a flying visit to a neighbor's house to borrow\r\nfire.  Indeed, the habit of borrowing and lending extended to nearly\r\nevery movable thing that any one possessed.  Tools, food, especially\r\nfresh meat, the labor of men, oxen and horses were borrowed and lent.\r\nFarming tools were few in number and rude in construction.  Many of\r\nthem were made upon the farms, either by the farmers themselves, or by\r\nthe help of poorly instructed mechanics.  The modern plough was\r\nunknown.  Hay and manure forks, scythes, hoes, were so rough, uncouth\r\nand heavy that they would now be rejected by the commonest laborer.  As\r\nearly as 1830 by father bought a cast-iron plough; it was the wonder of\r\nthe neighborhood and the occasion of many prophecies that were to be\r\nfalsified by events.\r\n\r\nMy father was a practical man and a gentleman by nature.  With him\r\ncivility was innate.  He was a close observer and something of a\r\nphilosopher.  I recall his statement made in my childhood that matter\r\nwas indestructible.  He was of even temper, and of an imperturbable\r\nspirit.  His paternal ancestor on this side of the Atlantic was made a\r\nfreeman at Lynn in 1638.  Of his arrival in the country there is no\r\nrecord.  From that date there had been no marriage except into English\r\nfamilies.  My father was purely English.  My mother, whose family name\r\nwas Marshall, and who was a descendant of John Marshall who came in the\r\n_Hopewell_, Captain Babb, in 1635, was English also through all her\r\nancestors from John Marshall.\r\n\r\nMy father enjoyed the respect and confidence of his fellow citizens and\r\nhe held many of the offices of the town and for many years.  In 1843\r\nand 1844 he was a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives\r\nand in 1853 he was a member of the Constitutional Convention.  I was\r\nalso a member of the same bodies, and the association with my father\r\nunder such peculiar circumstances is one of the pleasant recollections\r\nof my life.*  My mother belonged to a family of unusual intellectual\r\nendowment, and of great rigidity of opinion.  Her father, Jacob\r\nMarshall, was a student by tendency and habit, a stone mason and farmer\r\nby occupation, and the inventor of the press used for pressing hops and\r\ncotton in square bales.  He lived to be more than eighty years of age,\r\nwas twice married, and had a large family of children whom he educated\r\nand trained as well as children could be trained and educated at the\r\nclose of the last century in a country town in northern Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nFor the last fifty years of his life he devoted himself to the study of\r\nthe bible and such works of history as he could command.  His knowledge\r\nof the bible was so great that he was an oracle in the town, although\r\nhe departed from the popular faith and became a Universalist.  He lived\r\ncomfortably and without hard work, and in the later years of his life\r\nhe became the owner of two farms in the northerly part of Lunenburg.\r\nAs I recollect him and his farms he could not have been a good farmer.\r\nHis crop was hops, and that crop always commanded money, at a time when\r\nit was unusual to realize money for farm produce.\r\n\r\nAs my father's house was a mile from the District School, and as there\r\nwas a school within twenty or thirty rods of my grandfather's house, I\r\nwas sent to my grandfather's for my first winter's schooling.  I think\r\nit must have been the winter of 1823-4.  The teacher was Ithamar\r\nButters, called Dr. Butters from the circumstance that he had studied\r\nmedicine for a time with Dr. Aaron Bard, a physician in the village.\r\nOf Dr. Butters as a teacher I remember little.  He became a disbeliever\r\nin the Bible--an agnostic of those days.  I recollect a remark of his\r\nmade many years after:  That he would prefer the worst hell to\r\nannihilation, which he believed would be his fate.\r\n\r\nI learned to read by standing in front of my mother as she read the\r\nBible.  Of course all the letters were inverted, and the faculty of\r\nreading an inverted page, has remained.\r\n\r\nI went to the District School summer and winter, until I was ten years\r\nof age, and to the winter school until I passed my seventeenth\r\nbirthday, when my school life ended.  My father and mother were\r\nscrupulous about my attendance, and I cannot recall that I was ever\r\nallowed to be absent during the school term either for work or pleasure.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached the age of ten years I was kept on the farm during the\r\nsummer months, until I left home in December, 1830.  In those days\r\nfarmers' boys did not enjoy the luxury of shoes in the summer, nor\r\nindeed in the autumn season.  More than once I picked chestnuts bare-\r\nfooted and often I have tended the oxen in the mowing field frosty\r\nmornings and warmed my feet by standing on a stone.\r\n\r\nOnce only during my home life did I go to Boston with my father.  He\r\ncarried poultry in a one-horse wagon.  I accompanied him.  The year may\r\nhave been 1828, or '9 or '30.  On our way he stopped at one of the\r\nWaltham cotton factories to see a niece of my father who was there at\r\nwork.  We lodged that night at the house of Madam Coffin.  She was then\r\nalready old in my sight.  She seemed pleased with my father's visit,\r\nand the impression left upon my mind is that we were entertained with\r\nmarked consideration.  My father had managed her farm for about five\r\nyears from 1809 to 1814, when he volunteered for service in the army,\r\nand for ninety days he was on the island then known as Fort Warren.\r\n\r\nThe next morning we reached Boston and stationed our wagon at the\r\nnorthwest corner of Quincy Market, where we sold our poultry.  During\r\nthe day my father had occasion to go to the store of Joseph Mead, at\r\nthe corner of Lyman Place, and I was left in charge of the wagon.  I\r\nhad the fortune to sell some of the poultry.  My father thought that\r\nthe proceeds in money did not equal the decrease in stock, and so it\r\nproved--for the next Sunday morning when I dressed for meeting I found\r\na two dollar bill in my trousers' pocket.\r\n\r\nThat night we spent with Captain Hyde, at Newton Corner.  During the\r\nfirst year of my father's married life he had carried on a farm on the\r\nopposite side of the highway, and it was from Captain Hyde that he\r\nobtained his knowledge of budding and grafting, and some knowledge of\r\nthe art of gardening.  They always continued friends; Captain Hyde came\r\nto my father's, in after years, and supplied our farm with the best\r\nvarieties of cherry, peach and apple trees.\r\n\r\nThe day following we went to Brighton where my father purchased the\r\nremnant of a drove of cattle that had been driven from the State of\r\nMaine--twenty-four in number.  Of these nine were oxen and the rest\r\nwere young animals between two and four years of age, and all were\r\nbought for the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars.  My father was\r\nthen the overseer of the almshouse, and the purchase was primarily for\r\nthat establishment, but some of the animals were sold to the neighbors.\r\nThe result of the purchase was to me a short experience as a drover.\r\n\r\nAs I recollect the experiences of my life on my father's farm, there\r\nwere many amusements and relaxations mingled with the hardships.  In\r\nthe winter the house was cold, with only open fires for warming rooms.\r\nWe had, however, an abundance of wood, and in the evenings a supply of\r\ncider, apples and nuts for ourselves and for the neighbors.  There were\r\nalways one or two poor families in the neighborhood who enjoyed the\r\nmoderate comforts of our house.  I recall one man, who after a visit\r\nwould stop at the pile of wood, near the house, and carry a backload to\r\nhis home.  My father often saw the stealing, but the culprit never knew\r\nfrom any word or act that he had been discovered or suspected.\r\n\r\nThe ponds and brooks in the vicinity gave us a chance for fishing, and\r\nthere was some shooting, especially of pigeons in the autumn.  The oak\r\nforests had not then fallen, and the pigeons were abundant in September\r\nand until there were heavy night frosts, when they would leave for\r\nmilder regions.  For several years my father baited pigeons, and caught\r\nthem in a net.  To do this we were in the bough-house by daylight.  A\r\nwicked advantage was taken by soaking the grain in anise-seed cordial,\r\nwhich made the birds noisy and active, thus attracting other pigeons\r\nto the stand.  The device of taking pigeons in a net and wringing their\r\nnecks is a brutal business, as is all slaughtering of animals.\r\n\r\nFrom 1820 to 1830 religious controversies were violent and universal.\r\nNo one of the towns in Massachusetts was free from them.  Under the\r\ncolonial system each town was a religious corporation as well as a\r\npolitical one.  There was one church and one meetinghouse in each town,\r\nand the parochial expenses were paid from the municipal revenues.  In\r\n1780 when the constitution was adopted, some progress had been made,\r\nbut by the Third Article of the Bill of Rights, every citizen was\r\nrequired to be a member of some religious society.  As a result, new\r\nsocieties were formed, and in many instances there were so organized\r\nand managed as to avoid expenses.  About the same time attacks were\r\nmade upon the Third Article of the Bill of Rights, and after an excited\r\ncontroversy covering many years, the constitution was changed in that\r\nrespect, by an amendment in the nature of a substitute, which was\r\nadopted by the people at an election held in the month of November,\r\n1833.  By that amendment each citizen was authorized to file a\r\ncertificate of non-membership with the clerk of the society of which he\r\nwas a member and thereafter he was free from any contract or obligation\r\nof such society thereafter made.\r\n\r\nThe little town of Lunenburg participated actively in the contest.  My\r\nfather advocated the amendment.  At the ancient meetinghouse the\r\nancient doctrines of future punishment were preached and the literal\r\ninspiration of the Bible from Genesis to Revelation was not questioned.\r\nThose who denied the one or doubted the other were denounced as\r\ninfidels.  Religious topics were the leading subjects of conversation,\r\nand the fruitful source of personal and neighborhood controversies.  My\r\nfather rejected the doctrine of physical punishment in another state of\r\nexistence, and he came to regard the Bible as a record of events, and\r\nthe expression of human thought and feeling, rather than as a message\r\nof the Divine will.\r\n\r\nPerhaps as early as 1820 the Methodists had organized a church and\r\nsecured a place of meeting in the north part of the town on a by-road.\r\nThe building was not as good in quality or style as is a modern barn.\r\nMy father separated himself from the old society and joined the\r\nMethodist society.  In that organization each one paid what he chose.\r\nI recollect attending meetings in the old barn, but the distance was\r\ngreat and the inconveniences were numerous.  The converts could endure\r\nthe inconveniences, but as my father was not a convert nor a believer\r\nhis interest was slight.  Afterwards, however, the Methodists built a\r\nmeetinghouse in the village, and for several years we had seats and\r\nattended the services.  Once in two or three years the denomination\r\nheld camp meetings in the autumn and the work of conversions would go\r\non rapidly.  The scenes were such as are now reported of the negro\r\nrace in the states of the South.  Young girls would shout, crying out\r\nthat they had found Jesus, fall down, and lie senseless, or at least\r\nspeechless, for many minutes.  After brief periods of excitement many\r\nof the converts returned to their old ways of life, neither better nor\r\nworse.\r\n\r\nDuring these years the Universalists held meetings at Shirley Village,\r\nquite eight miles away.  My father attended occasionally, and not\r\ninfrequently I went with him.  I had therefore the opportunity to hear\r\nthe great preachers of the denomination--Russell Streeter, Sebastian\r\nStreeter, brothers; Thomas Whittemore, the editor of the _Trumpet_, the\r\norgan of the sect, Hosea Ballou, Walter Balfour, and others whose names\r\nI do not recall.  Balfour was a Scotchman, preaching with an accent,\r\nand rolling his scalp, from his eyes to the nape of his neck.  The\r\nsermons had two peculiarities.  First the text was examined carefully\r\nand so construed as to show that the author, whether Jesus, Peter, or\r\nPaul, taught the doctrine of universal salvation.  Then came a process\r\nof reasoning designed to show that God could not punish his creatures\r\nin a lake of fire and brimstone.  First, he was all-powerful; next, he\r\nwas all-wise; then he was infinitely just, and finally his mercy was\r\nwithout limit.  Could a being endowed with these attributes consign his\r\nchildren to unending misery?  From the first I saw the defect in the\r\nprocess of reasoning.  The premises were not faulty, but given a being\r\nwith infinite faculties, could another being, with finite faculties\r\nonly, forecast the result of the exercise or operation of the infinite?\r\n\r\nThe little town was made notorious by the career of the physician, Dr.\r\nAaron Bard.  He was born in Jaffrey, N. H., about the year 1770.  He\r\nobtained his medical education in part at least, at Troy, N. Y., from\r\nwhich place he fled to avoid arrest upon the charge of robbing graves.\r\nHis parents were rigid believers in the old faith, and in that faith\r\nthey had trained the son.  Against that faith the son rebelled, dropped\r\nthe second \"a\" in his baptismal name, and rejected the Scriptures as\r\nnot containing divine truth.  As the mass of the people believed\r\nimplicitly in the divine origin and plenary inspiration of the Bible, a\r\ndisbeliever was denounced as an infidel and punished by social outlawry.\r\n\r\nBard was not a quiet doubter.  He attacked the Bible, ridiculed much of\r\nthe Old Testament, accepted controversies with the clergy, although he\r\nattended their families without charge.  His reputation as a physician\r\nwas considerable, and although his enemies, who were many, made\r\nrepeated efforts to secure a competitor, the wary declined their\r\ninvitations, and the credulous were soon driven away by poverty, or the\r\nfear of it.  Bard was a bachelor, lived economically, never presented a\r\nbill, and when he died, about the year 1850, his books were free of\r\ncharges.  Before the repeal of the Third Article in the Bill of Rights,\r\nBard organized a society which by some art of logic was so far\r\nrecognized as a religious body as to exempt its members from taxation\r\nin the old parish.  It flourished until the Third Article was annulled,\r\nwhen it disappeared.  Bard purchased a Hebrew bible, lexicon and\r\ngrammar, and proceed to translate parts of the Old Testament,\r\nespecially the early chapters in Genesis, and in such manner as to\r\nthrow doubt upon the received version.  His Sundays were devoted to\r\ntalks in his office, where were gathered a few hearers, some because\r\nthey agreed with him, and others because they were interested in\r\nhearing what he had to offer.\r\n\r\nHe was of small size, hardy, ingenious, and free from meanness.  He\r\nwas economical and his ways of business forbade any extravagance.  When\r\nhe needed hay or grain for his horses or wood for his fire he called\r\nupon some of the farmers whose physician he was, and obtained a supply.\r\nBeyond this he made no demand for payment, though when it was offered\r\nhe accepted it.  Until he was about sixty years of age, he rode on\r\nhorseback, and always without an overcoat.  From my thirteenth to my\r\nseventeenth year I was boy and clerk in a store at a distance of less\r\nthan five rods from Bard's office.  I saw him constantly.  His\r\ndenunciations of Christianity were so violent and unreasonable that\r\nmany persons would revolt at the thought of accepting his theories.  He\r\nhad followers, however, and the trial of Abner Kneeland for blasphemy\r\npromoted the spread of infidel opinions.  I do not now recollect that\r\nI heard Bard express any opinion as to a future state of existence.  In\r\nthat particular he was probably an agnostic.  When in later years I saw\r\na plaster cast of the head of Voltaire at the Cambridge Museum of\r\nComparative Anatomy, I was impressed with the resemblance between\r\nBard's head and that cast.\r\n\r\nHis success as a physician was due probably to his ingenuity and keen\r\npowers of observation rather than to his learning.  All his faculties\r\nwere active, and he appreciated the importance of the laws of progress.\r\nWhen homeopathy had taken some hold upon public opinion, he said:\r\n\"There is nothing in it, but then it has done a great deal of good.  It\r\nhas taught us not to give so much medicine.  We killed a great many\r\npeople with medicine, but it is several years now since I killed a\r\nman.\"  This remark was made in 1842 or 1843.\r\n\r\nIn my boyhood the Rev. David Damon was the minister.  He was a graduate\r\nof Harvard College, a man of learning, of good standing in the\r\nprofession, and a satisfactory preacher.  His temper was mild, and it\r\nwas not easy for Bard to engage in bitter contests with him.  Mr. Damon\r\nleft Lunenburg about 1827, and settled in West Cambridge, where he died\r\nsuddenly in the pulpit.  Among the constant attendants upon Mr. Damon's\r\nSunday services at Lunenburg was a blacksmith named Kimball, who was\r\nafflicted with deafness.  From his trade perhaps he had come to be\r\ncalled Puffer Kimball.  From a front seat in the meetinghouse he had\r\nventured upon the pulpit stairs, and finally he had reached the\r\nposition of standing on an upper stair, resting his arms upon the desk,\r\nand with his hand to his ear listening to the services from beginning\r\nto end.  In the east part of the town was a farmer named James\r\nGilchrist, a Scotch Irishman, weighing not less than two hundred and\r\nfifty pounds, and the father of four grown sons who where his equals\r\nin weight, and all of them of great strength.  Gilchrist abandoned the\r\nSunday meetings and when Mr. Damon asked him for his reason he said he\r\nwouldn't have his religion strained through old Puffer Kimball.\r\n\r\nThis same Gilchrist had had a controversy ending in a slander suit with\r\nMr. Damon's predecessor, the Rev. Timothy Flint.  Mr. Flint was a man\r\nof recognized ability, a good preacher, but erratic in his ways.  For\r\nsome purpose not well understood, he built a furnace in the cellar of\r\nhis house.  His friends maintained that he was engaged in scientific\r\nexperiments, and such was his purpose, no doubt, but his enemies and\r\nthe more ignorant of the community assumed that his plan was to coin\r\nmoney.  One day, in a store kept by Mr. Cunningham (the grandfather or\r\ngreat-grandfather of Gen. James Cunningham,) Gilchrist exhibited a coin\r\nand said:  \"Here is a dollar that Tim Flint made.\"  Flint returned the\r\nchallenge with a suit, which I think was adjusted without a trial, but\r\nthe controversy contributed to the dissolution of the settlement.\r\nFlint left the town to which he returned once in my boyhood and\r\npreached a sermon in the new meetinghouse, that had been substituted\r\nfor the old one used in the days of Zabdiel Adams, of Timothy Flint,\r\nand David Damon.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Lunenburg Flint went with his family to the valley of the\r\nMississippi, and led the life of a wanderer, floating down the river\r\nwith his family and making his way back as best he might.  In these\r\nexpeditions children were born and children died.  He wrote two\r\nromances founded on Western primitive life, and a history of the\r\nMississippi Valley.  Time may give to his works a value that they did\r\nnot appear to possess when they were published.  Flint was recognized\r\nin the town as a man of ability, but he failed to secure the\r\naffections or even the confidence of the people.  He was a man of\r\nready faculty, being able to write his sermons Saturday evening, with\r\nhis children around him.\r\n\r\nParson Adams, a cousin of John Adams and the predecessor of Flint, had\r\nlived among his people as a chieftain.  He was not only the spiritual\r\nteacher, he was supreme in most other matters.  Unlike the Adams family\r\ngenerally, he had a rough wit and a sententious practical wisdom about\r\ncommon things not unlike the kindred conspicuous qualities in Dr.\r\nFranklin.  If the traditions that existed in my boyhood were\r\ntrustworthy, he said and did things that would have ruined an ordinary\r\nminister.  Adams gave an earnest support to the Revolution, and one\r\nof his sermons delivered at the opening of the war contained a view of\r\nthe coming greatness of the country that was truly prophetic.\r\n\r\nSamuel Dexter studied law at Lunenburg.  He was there married by the\r\nRev. Zabdiel Adams to a Miss Gordon, a daughter of an English lady.\r\n\r\nThe successor of Mr. Damon was the Rev. Joseph Hubbard, and during his\r\nministry the old society that represented the town of former days came\r\nto an end.  The first error was the scheme for erecting a new meeting-\r\nhouse.  The larger part of the village is on the southern side of a\r\nhill, and the first meetinghouse was midway on the slope and facing\r\nsouth.  The site was a triangular piece of land, of more than one\r\nhundred rods in extent, on which were shade trees planted in other\r\ndays.  If the whole town had been at command not another equally good\r\nsite could have been selected.  A spirit, called the spirit of\r\nprogress, had seized the leaders and it was resolved to build a new\r\nmeetinghouse on the top of the hill.  The house was built, but in the\r\nmeantime the society lost members.  Following the dedication of the new\r\nhouse, there came complaints against Hubbard as a preacher.  He made\r\nenemies, and his enemies promoted disturbances.  Efforts were made to\r\ndissolve the connection.  Hubbard having been settled for life, these\r\nefforts were ineffectual.  Finally his salary was withheld and the\r\nhouse was closed against him.  Sunday after Sunday, morning and\r\nafternoon, Hubbard would walk from the parsonage to the meetinghouse,\r\ntry the doors and then return home.  As long as the doors were open, I\r\nattended the services--the congregation diminishing until the pews were\r\ngiven up to the boys and those who attended from curiosity.  One\r\nmorning the seats of the singers were vacant, and Hubbard read the hymn\r\ncommencing:  \"Let those refuse to sing, who never knew their God.\"\r\nThat was the last, or near the last of his Sunday services.\r\n\r\nAs the controversy went on, the members of the parish withdrew, until\r\nthe only one remaining who possessed any property was an uncle of mine,\r\nTimothy Marshall.  He lived in the easterly part of the town, and he\r\nwas a Universalist in opinion.  He owned a small farm and a sawmill on\r\nthe Mulpus Brook.  His chief delights were reading, discussing\r\npolitical and religious questions, and gathering information in the\r\ndepartment of the natural sciences.  He associated a good deal with Dr.\r\nBard, but he never accepted Bard's views of the Bible.  He had\r\ncontinued with the old society from indisposition to disturb himself\r\nrather than from sympathy with its teachings, or regard for its\r\ninterests.  At the conclusion of the active controversy between Hubbard\r\nand the society, the unpaid salary amounted to several hundred dollars.\r\nHubbard threatened suit, and he may have commenced one.  In that\r\njuncture my uncle went over the town and gathered the signatures of\r\nthose nominal members who had no property, who had not paid taxes, and\r\nwhose eyes had not seen the inside of a meetinghouse.  A parish meeting\r\nwas called, composed by my uncle and his new adherents.  At the end\r\nauthority was given for the conveyance to Mr. Hubbard of the site of\r\nthe old meetinghouse in full satisfaction of his claim.  This spot was\r\nin the center of the village and in the view of the houses of the\r\nprincipal residents.  Not their curiosity merely, but their fears were\r\nexcited when they learned that their bitter enemy was to become the\r\nowner of the common in the center of the village.  To be sure the\r\nbounds were indefinite, but there was a spot belonging to the parish,\r\nand it included all that was not highway.\r\n\r\nMy uncle had an understanding with Hubbard that the land was to be\r\nconveyed to Hubbard and the society released from all its liabilities\r\nunder the contract.  Then the land was to be conveyed to my uncle for\r\nthe sum of six hundred dollars.  This was done, and my uncle became the\r\nowner of the common.  He was not a friend of the citizens of the\r\nvillage, and various uncomfortable surmises were set afloat.  But my\r\nuncle had but little malice in his nature, and moreover he was too\r\ninert to indulge in the luxury of avenging any wrong either real or\r\nimaginary.  The common was left to the use of stray cattle, the\r\nchildren of the neighborhood and of the school.  After a time the\r\nschool district decided to rebuild the school-house.  The old site was\r\nsmall, indeed, only sufficient for the building.  The citizens\r\ndivided, but the advocates of the old site prevailed, and a brick\r\nbuilding was erected.  Still the contest went on, and after a year or\r\ntwo the majority of the district voted to erect a new house, and the\r\nupper part of the common was selected for the site where a second\r\nhouse, of wood, was built.  Whether any title to the land was obtained\r\nfrom my uncle, I know not.  The new house was used for a time, when it\r\nwas sold, moved, and converted into a dwelling.\r\n\r\nWhen my uncle died at the age of about eighty-five years, the common\r\nwas unoccupied, and it had the appearance that property takes on when\r\nthe owner is intemperate or absent, or when the heirs cannot agree to\r\na division.  The settlement of my uncle's estate was put into the hands\r\nof Mr. Ephraim Graham, whose brother had married my uncle's eldest\r\ndaughter.  My uncle's children were scattered, and apparently they\r\ninherited their father's indifference to property.  Graham was unable\r\nto finish any business, and after ten or more years he died, leaving\r\nthe estate unsettled.  Finally, the ladies of the village took\r\npossession of the common, removed the rubbish, leveled the ground, and\r\nmade the spot an agreeable feature of the town.\r\n\r\nOf the teachers of the village school there are several that I remember\r\nwith gratitude, and I cannot but think that some of them were very good\r\nteachers.  My first teacher was Martha Putnam, afterwards Mrs.\r\nNathaniel F. Cunningham.  Of her as a teacher I can recall nothing.\r\nHer father, Major Daniel Putnam, was the principal trader in the\r\nvillage.  For the time and place his accumulations were very large.\r\nNancy Stearns, afterwards Mrs. Benjamin Snow, was the teacher of the\r\nsummer school for many years.  But beyond comparison Cyrus Kilburn was\r\nthe best teacher of the town, and a person who would have ranked high\r\namong teachers at any period in the history of the State.  He was not a\r\nlearned man in a large sense, but his habit was to investigate the\r\nsubjects within his scope, with great thoroughness.  Grammar was his\r\nfavorite study, and he devised a system of analysis in parsing quite in\r\nadvance of the time.  He had the faculty of putting questions and of\r\nchanging them to meet the capacities of the pupils.  He compelled\r\nthinking.  I attended the winter school about ten terms, and of these\r\nnot less than six terms were taught by Mr. Kilburn.\r\n\r\nIn later years we had Colburn's Sequel as the arithmetic.  From this I\r\npassed to algebra and geometry, and during the last two terms I\r\nstudied Latin Grammar.  My school-going days ended in February, 1835,\r\na month after my seventeenth birthday.\r\n\r\n[* During the session of the Legislature of 1843 or 1844, I walked with\r\nmy father on the ice from Boston to Fort Warren, a distance of about\r\nthree miles.  The authorities were then engaged in cutting a channel\r\nfor the departure of a Cunard steamer.]\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\nLIFE AS A STORE-BOY AND CLERK\r\n\r\nIn the month of December, 1830, when I was about one month less than\r\nthirteen years of age, Mr. Simeon Heywood, the postmaster at Lunenburg\r\nand the owner of a small store, proposed to my father that I should go\r\ninto his service to remain four years.  An arrangement was made by\r\nwhich I was to receive my board and clothes, and the privilege of\r\nattending school during the winter months.  I commenced my service the\r\n26th of December, 1830, and I remained until December 1, 1834.\r\n\r\nMy life with Mr. Heywood was a peculiar one.  The business of the store\r\nwas largely in the sale of goods for hats made of palm leaf.  The\r\nbusiness was comparatively new at the time.  For many previous years\r\nthe women had been employed in braiding straw and making hats and\r\nbonnets for market.  Gradually, work in palm leaf had taken the place\r\nof work in straw.  The neighbor of Heywood, Major Daniel Putnam, was\r\ndoing a large business in hats.  The preparation of the palm leaves was\r\nnot an easy business.  The leaves were stripped on the folds by the\r\nhand, then bleached with sulphur in large boxes.  The leaves were then\r\nsplit so as to produce straws from one twentieth to one eighth of an\r\ninch in width.  The first process of stripping the leaves on the folds\r\nwas paid for at the rate of ten cents per one hundred leaves.  I\r\ndevoted my leisure to the work, and thus earned a small sum of money.\r\nHeywood was a shoemaker by trade, and an end of the store was used as\r\na shop.  There one man and sometimes two men were employed.  From much\r\nseeing I was able to make a pair of shoes for myself--rather for the\r\namusement of the thing than from any advantage.  While at Heywood's\r\nstore, probably about 1834, I had a disagreeable experience, the\r\nrecollection of which has often returned.  A blacksmith, named Choate,\r\ndied, and with another boy, whose name I do not recall, I was\r\nsummoned to watch the body during a night.  We occupied an adjoining\r\nroom, and once an hour we were required to bathe the face of the corpse\r\nin spirits of camphor.  To this day I have never been able to\r\nunderstand why two half-grown boys were put to such service.\r\n\r\nHeywood was more of an inventor than a trader, and becoming interested\r\nin the manufacture of nail kegs he made an invention in connection with\r\nDr. Bard for sawing staves concave on one side and convex on the other.\r\nIn the year 1834 they obtained a patent for the invention.  As a\r\nconsequence the business of the store was neglected.  The invention did\r\nnot yield a large return in money, as it was soon superseded by other\r\ndevices.  The saw, a hoop-saw, was set up in a mill two miles away, and\r\nfrom time to time I tended the saw, and thus I began a training in\r\nmechanics which has been useful to me in my profession as a patent\r\nlawyer.  Heywood also invented a wheel for bringing staves to a bevel\r\nand taper, for the construction of barrels systematically.  Mr. Heywood\r\nremained in town eight or ten years, when he moved to Claremont, N. H.,\r\nwhere he died at the age of eighty years or more.  He was thoroughly\r\nupright, but he had too many schemes for a successful business man.\r\nDuring my term with Mr. Heywood, I had charge of the post-office,\r\nkeeping the accounts, which were then cumbrous, and I made the returns\r\nonce in three months.\r\n\r\nDuring a part of the time a stagecoach ran from Lowell, through\r\nTyngsboro, Pepperell, Townsend Harbor, Lunenburg and Fitchburg, and\r\nthence westward through Petersham and Belchertown to Springfield.  The\r\ndistance was about one hundred miles, and I was compelled to be ready\r\nto open the mail three mornings each week, at about two o'clock.  The\r\ndriver would sound his horn when he was eighty or one hundred rods\r\naway, and it was my duty to be ready to take the mail when the coach\r\narrived at the door.\r\n\r\nIt was when so summoned that it was my fortune to see the shower of\r\nfalling stars in November, 1833.  From the time I arose until after\r\ndaylight there was no part of the heavens that was not illuminated--not\r\nwith one meteor merely--but with many hundreds.  Many of them left a\r\nlong train, extending through twenty, thirty, or even forty degrees.  I\r\ncalled at Bard's window and told him that the stars were falling, but\r\nhe refused to get up, thinking it a joke.  The butcher of the town,\r\nAbijah Whitney, came out to commence preparations for his morning\r\nrounds, but conceiving that the day of judgment had come, he returned\r\ninto the house and gave up business for the day.  In the year 1901, I\r\nknow of one other person only, Mrs. Mary A. Livermore, who witnessed\r\nthat exhibition, and it has not been repeated.\r\n\r\nDuring my term with Mr. Heywood, and for many previous years, and for a\r\nshort period afterwards, the business of printing standard books,\r\nBibles, spelling-books and dictionaries had been carried on at\r\nLunenburg by Col. Edmund Cushing.  The books were bound, and then sent\r\nby teams to Boston.  The printing was on hand-presses, and upon\r\nstereotype plates.  Deacon William Harrington carried on a small\r\nbusiness as a bookbinder, and Messrs. William Greenough & Sons erected\r\na building on the farm now owned by Mr. Brown on the Lancaster road,\r\nand introduced the business of stereotyping--business then new, I\r\nthink.  These various industries gave employment of a large number of\r\nworkmen, mostly young men.  The establishment of Colonel Cushing was\r\nnear the store of Heywood, and it was at the bindery that I first saw\r\nAlvah Crocker, afterwards known in the politics of the State, and as\r\nthe projector of the Fitchburg railroad.  He was a maker of paper at\r\nFitchburg, and he came with a one-horse wagon to Cushing's place and\r\ncarried away the paper shavings produced in the bindery.  Crocker was\r\na lean and awkward man, remarkable for his voice, which could be heard\r\nover the larger part of the village.  When in after years we were\r\nassociated in the Massachusetts House of Representatives, and boarded\r\nat the same hotel, the Hanover House, I was compelled to hear the same\r\nvoice in constant advocacy of the Fitchburg railroad project.\r\n\r\nColonel Cushing was one of the foremost men in town, but his\r\naristocratic ways made him unpopular, and therefore he failed to secure\r\nofficial recognition.  He was the father of Luther S. Cushing, for many\r\nyears clerk of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, then\r\nreporter of the decisions of the Supreme Court, afterwards a judge upon\r\nthe bench of the Court of Common Pleas, and then the author of\r\nCushing's Manual.  Another of his sons, Edmund Cushing, Jr., was a\r\nmember of the Supreme Court of the State of New Hampshire.  Of his two\r\nother sons, one was a clergyman, and one a civil engineer.  The sons\r\nwere all my seniors, and my acquaintance with them was limited, but\r\nwhen I became a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives,\r\nin January, 1842, Luther S. Cushing, then the clerk, came to me, and\r\nafter some words of congratulation, gave me this advice:  \"Never\r\nchampion any private scheme, unless the parties are your constituents.\"\r\nGood advice, which I followed in all my legislative experience.\r\n\r\nDuring the four winters of my term with Mr. Heywood, I attended the\r\nschool, studying the usual branches with something of algebra,\r\ngeometry, and Latin grammar.  It was during these years that the\r\nteacher, Mr. Kilburn, created such an interest in his plans that he\r\nobtained a contribution of twenty-four dollars with which he\r\npurchased a twelve-inch celestial and a twelve-inch terrestrial globe.\r\nSeveral pleasant evenings were devoted to a study of the heavens with\r\nthe aid of the celestial globe.  I attended usually, and thus I gained\r\na partial knowledge of the constellations, and an acquaintance with\r\nsome of the stars by name and location.  The post-office gave me\r\naccess to several publications of the day, and in one or two instances\r\nI obtained a few subscribers to journals, and thus secured a free copy\r\nfor myself.  _The Penny Magazine_ I obtained in that way for two years.\r\nIn the cholera seasons of 1832-3 and 1834, the people were so alarmed\r\nthat they hesitated to take letters and papers from the post-office.\r\nFor a time gum-camphor was thought to be a preventive against the\r\ncontagion.\r\n\r\nBetween 1830 and 1834 the ambition of the town was stimulated by the\r\nbuilding of a new road from Fitchburg to Shirley.  It was claimed that\r\na shorter and more nearly level route to Boston from Fitchburg and the\r\ncountry above was thus secured.  For a time the travel was\r\nconsiderable, but the teamsters preferred the old roads, the old\r\ntaverns, and the old acquaintances.  The construction of the Fitchburg\r\nrailroad in 1844 ended the business from the country to Boston over the\r\nold highways.\r\n\r\nIn the month of November, 1834, I had a call from Mr. Joseph Hazen, of\r\nShirley, who asked me to accept the post of teacher in the school at\r\nPound Hill, half-way between Shirley Village and Shirley Centre.  The\r\npay was sixteen dollars per month in addition to board.  After making\r\nan arrangement with Mr. Heywood, by which I was to pay him eight\r\ndollars for the twenty-six days in December, I accepted the invitation,\r\nand after an examination conducted by the Rev. Seth Chandler and the\r\nRev. Hope Brown, I entered the school the first Monday of the month of\r\nDecember.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding June I had received my freedom suit of clothes--blue\r\ncoat, bright buttons, black trousers, and buff vest.  They were made by\r\nDaniel Cross, of Fitchburg, and, when in 1884, I visited that town, and\r\nfound him still engaged in the business, I ordered a dress suit from\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\nCHANGES AND PROGRESS\r\n\r\nAs I pass in this record from my childhood and early youth to the\r\nresponsibilities of life, I am led to some reflections upon the changes\r\nin opinions and the changes in the condition of the people in the more\r\nthan half-century from 1835 to 1899.  At the first period there was not\r\na clergyman of any of the Protestant denominations who questioned the\r\nplenary and verbal inspiration of the Scriptures, including the Old and\r\nNew Testaments.  The suggestion could not have safely been made in any\r\nNew England pulpit that there were errors of translation, and yet the\r\nChristian world, outside the Catholic Church, now accepts a revision\r\nthat changes the meaning of some passages and excludes others as\r\ninterpolations.  The account given in the first chapter of Genesis of\r\nthe creation of the world and of man was accepted according to the\r\nmeaning of the language used.  At the present moment there is not a\r\nwell-educated clergyman of any denomination who would not either treat\r\nthe account as a legend, or else explain the days as periods of\r\nindefinite duration.\r\n\r\nThe claim of the verbal and plenary inspiration of the Old Testament is\r\ndenied by many and doubted by others, and the volume is seen and\r\ntreated by them as a compilation of works or books in which are\r\nrecorded the thoughts and doings of men and tribes and nations that\r\nexisted at different periods and flourished or suffered as is the\r\nfortune of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe early chapters of Genesis were then a faithful history; they are\r\nnow a legend.  The Book of Job was then an inspiration; it is now a\r\npoem.  The reported interviews between Abraham and Jehovah were then\r\nthought to have been real; now they are treated as the visions of an\r\nexcited brain.  The ten commandments were then believed to have been\r\ndelivered to Moses by the Supreme Being; now they are regarded as the\r\nwork of a wise law-giver.  Kings and Chronicles are now authentic\r\nhistories written by honest men; then those records of events were\r\nattributed to the Supreme Ruler of the world.\r\n\r\nThe domain of prayer has been limited.  Prayers for rain, for health,\r\nfor mild winters and fruitful summers, were then made in all the\r\nchurches.  Now, with many exceptions no doubt, health is sought in\r\nobedience to the laws of our being, and the seasons find their quality\r\nin the operation of laws whose sources are in material organizations\r\nthat cannot yield to human impulses.\r\n\r\nThe sources of knowledge have been multiplied almost indefinitely.  In\r\n1835 the daily newspaper was not often seen in country towns, and the\r\ncirculation of the weekly paper was limited to a very small portion of\r\nthe families.  The postage was an important item.  Relatively, the cost\r\nof papers was enormous.  The mails were infrequent, and the people\r\ngenerally had not the means of paying the combined expenses.  Many,\r\nperhaps most, of the papers, were sent upon credit, and it was not\r\nunusual to find subscribers several years in arrears.  Many of the\r\npapers contained this notice:  \"No paper discontinued until all\r\narrearages are paid,\" as though sending a paper to a subscriber in\r\ndebt, would compel him to make payment.  New books were rare.  The\r\nfarmers and laborers had no slight difficulty in meeting the demands\r\nfor schoolbooks, and these and the Bible were the total stock in a\r\nmajority of houses.\r\n\r\nThe means of domestic comfort were limited to a degree not now easily\r\ncomprehended.  The brick oven and the open fire were the only means of\r\ncooking, and the open fire was the only means of warming the houses.\r\nSoon after 1835, and even before that year possibly, cylinder stoves\r\nwere introduced into shops and stores.  Stoves of other varieties soon\r\nfollowed.  Upholstered furniture and carpets were not found in the\r\nhouses of well-to-do farmers even.\r\n\r\nThe construction of railways and the invention of the telegraphic\r\nsystem of communication have revolutionized business and changed the\r\nhabits of the people, but only the beginnings of their power are yet\r\nseen.  They have made it possible for great free governments to exist\r\npermanently.  Except for differences of languages all Europe might\r\nbecome one state, if indeed, first, the individual states could over-\r\nthrow all dynastic institutions in families, and all forms of hierarchy\r\nin the churches.  These changes to be followed by the abolition of all\r\nforms of mortmain, by the free sale of land, by the distribution of the\r\nestates of deceased persons by operation of law, by compulsory\r\neducation with moral training, and the exclusion of all dogmatic\r\nteaching touching the origin or destiny of man.  This freedom and the\r\naggregation of small states in vast governments, by the consent of all\r\nparties, would be security for the peace of the world.  With general\r\npeace would come the abolition of great armies, freedom from public\r\ndebts, and numerous freeholders.  These are the conditions of domestic\r\nand social comfort, the chief and worthiest objects of the State\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nIn 1830 the movement against the use of intoxicating liquors began--or\r\nrather it was about that year that the movement was strong enough to\r\nlead a small number of country merchants to abandon the trade.  When I\r\nwent into Mr. Heywood's store, he had one hogshead of New England rum.\r\nThat was sold, and there the business ended.  As a general rule, the\r\nfarmers used rum daily during the summer season, and drank freely of\r\ncider during the winter.  On my father's farm, rum toddy was drunk\r\nthree times a day during the haying season, which lasted from the 4th\r\nof July to the 1st of August, or a little later.  There was no general\r\nuse of liquors at any other season.\r\n\r\nAt old election*--the last Wednesday in May--at Thanksgiving, the 4th\r\nof July, and when my grandfather visited us--which seems now not to\r\nhave been more than three or four times a year--a pitcher of West\r\nIndia rum toddy was made, seasoned with nutmeg and toasted crackers.\r\n\r\nThe poverty of farmers with respect of tools, made it almost impossible\r\nfor farmers to prosper, except by cattle-raising and the cultivation of\r\nsmall grains.  Farming is now an art, and the slavery of farm labor has\r\nin a degree disappeared.  Formerly the business of farming was limited\r\nby the home product of manure, but the manufacture of phosphates has\r\nenabled the farmer to enlarge his operations in every direction that\r\npromises a return.\r\n\r\nThe railway system had driven the eastern farmer from the cultivation\r\nof wheat and corn, as it is not possible for him to compete with the\r\nnew and fertile lands of the West.  In these sixty years the wheat\r\nfields have moved from the East to the West.  From 1820 to 1840 the\r\nvalleys of the Mohawk and the Genesee furnished the finer flour for the\r\ncities of New York and New England.  Pennsylvania, Maryland and\r\nVirginia supplied Baltimore and Philadelphia.  Then Ohio became the\r\nchief source of supply.  More recently the wheat region is the upper\r\nvalley of the Mississippi, and the State of California.  The time is\r\nnot far distant when a return movement will begin.  Domestic markets in\r\nthe vicinity of the great wheat fields will create a demand for other\r\nproducts.  With the exhaustion of the soil will come the necessity for\r\nthe use of artificial manures.  Thus will be established a permanent\r\ncondition of comparative equality between the East and the West.\r\n\r\nAlready the process has commenced in the culture of Indian corn.  For a\r\ntime the farmers of New England were unable to raise corn, even for\r\nfarm use, in competition with the West.  The fodder of the corn has now\r\nbecome valuable to farmers who produce milk for market, and already\r\nthey are finding it profitable to raise corn, even when the price at\r\nthe door does not exceed fifty cents per bushel.  Coincident with these\r\nchanges the States of the East have increased in population, and the\r\nproportion who live in cities is increasing at a greater ratio even.\r\nThe railway system and the system of protection to American industry\r\nhave been the chief instruments in the augmentation of population\r\ngenerally, and of the gains to cities.  These changes have inured to\r\nthe benefit of the Eastern farmers.\r\n\r\n[* Old election in Massachusetts was the last Wednesday in May, when,\r\nunder the Constitution of 1780, the governor was inaugurated.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\nSCHOOLS AND SCHOOL-KEEPING\r\n\r\nOf my pupils at Pound Hill an unusually large proportion were advanced\r\nin years.*  Several of the boys were my seniors, and in size they had\r\nquite an advantage over me, although my weight was then about 165\r\npounds.  That class gave me very little trouble.  The unruly boys were\r\nthose between ten and fifteen years of age.  With a few exceptions the\r\nleading people of the town were well-to-do farmers, and nearly every\r\nweek brought an invitation to a party at the house of some one of them.\r\nAn attendance of more than fifty persons was not an uncommon occurrence.\r\nThe term of the school was limited by the money, and either from the\r\nextra cost of firewood, or some other unusual expense, the school was\r\nbrought to a close two or three days sooner than was expected.  My\r\nfather was to come for me on a day named, but when my school was over,\r\nand I was free, I concluded to walk home, a distance of about six\r\nmiles, and return for my clothes when convenient.\r\n\r\nJust at that time there had been a heavy, warm rain, and a melting of\r\nsnow, which had raised the streams.  When I reached the bridge at the\r\nbrook on the west side of Flat Hill, the water was over the road to the\r\ndepth of twelve inches or more.  I concluded to wade across, which I\r\ndid.  My mother was frightened, but I escaped without any serious ill\r\neffect.  My school-keeping days were over.  My old teacher, Mr. Cyrus\r\nKilburn, had charge of the village school and I took my seat among the\r\npupils.  I remained in the school about two weeks, and then my school-\r\ndays were over.  Altogether I had the training of six or seven summer\r\nterms in schools kept by women, supplemented two or three times by a\r\nprivate school of a few weeks by the same teacher, and ten or eleven\r\nwinter terms.  In reading, spelling and grammar I had had a good\r\ntraining.  To those branches Mr. Kilburn devoted himself, and I recall\r\nhis teaching of grammar with great satisfaction.  He had no knowledge\r\nof object-teaching as applied to grammar, but he was skillful in\r\nanalysis, and his training was methodical and exact.  In fine, he was\r\nso much devoted to the work of teaching, that the discipline of the\r\nschool was neglected.  Of this there had been complaints for years.  At\r\nthat time I had a good command of arithmetic, I knew something of\r\nalgebra, and geometry seemed easy from the start.  In composition, so-\r\ncalled, I had had no experience.  Once only during my school life was\r\nan attempt made by a teacher to introduce the exercise of writing, and\r\nthat attempt I avoided.  In Latin I had not gone beyond the study of\r\nthe grammar, and the training that I had received was from persons\r\npoorly qualified to give instruction.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice the teacher had been a college undergraduate, and\r\nKilburn's knowledge of the language was measured by his acquisitions\r\nat the Groton Academy.  Of knowledge wholly useless to me I had learned\r\nto read the Hebrew alphabet from Dr. Bard's elementary Hebrew book.\r\nThe reading-books, especially Scott's Lessons, contained extracts from\r\ngood writers and speakers, with selections from the best of English\r\npoets, and these extracts and selections, I had read and had heard read\r\nso often that I could repeat many of them at full length.  Worcester's\r\nGeography, and Whelpley's Compend of History were among the books used\r\nin the schools.\r\n\r\n[* The Pound Hill schoolhouse has been sold to the owner of the Captain\r\nParker place and converted into a shop and tool-house.  A photograph\r\nhas been taken of the venerable relic.]\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\nGROTON IN 1835\r\n\r\nIn the month of February, 1835, I read an advertisement in the Lowell\r\n_Journal_, asking for a clerk in a store, application to be made at\r\nthe office.  I at once wrote to Joseph S. Hubbard,* a former\r\nschoolmate, asking him to call at the office and get the name of the\r\nadvertiser.  This he did, and gave me the name of Benj. P. Dix of\r\nGroton.  I wrote to Mr. Dix, and upon the receipt of an answer, I went\r\nwith my father to see him.  The result was an agreement to work for him\r\nfor three years.  Terms, board and one hundred dollars for the first\r\nyear, one hundred and twelve dollars for the second year, one hundred\r\nand twenty-five dollars for the third year.  I commenced my clerkship\r\nwith Mr. Dix the fifth day of March, and in the month of September my\r\ncontract was ended by his failure.  His business was small, his manners\r\nwere abrupt, his capital had been limited, and his family expenses, not\r\nextravagant, had exceeded his income, and bankruptcy in the end was\r\ninevitable.  His sales were chiefly of boots, shoes, leather, and\r\nmedicines, of which he kept the only stock in the village.\r\n\r\nMr. Dix was a man of exact ways of life.  The sales made were entered\r\neach day at the close of business, the cash was carefully counted, and\r\nthe cash-book was balanced.  But these careful and businesslike ways\r\ndid not save him, and in September he made an assignment of his\r\nproperty to his father Benj. Dix, and to Caleb Butler, for the benefit\r\nof his creditors according to the preferences specified in the\r\nassignment.  Mr. Butler was not a creditor, but Mr. Dix, senior, was\r\nmuch the largest creditor.  In fact he had furnished his son with the\r\nchief part of the means of doing business.  He was a tanner by trade,\r\nand he had gradually enlarged his business by employing workmen to make\r\nboots and shoes.  A portion of his product of leather and all his\r\nproduct of boots and shoes had been turned into the son's store.\r\n\r\nThe deficiency of means on the part of the son was represented at each\r\nsettlement by an addition to the debt due to the father.  The debts\r\namounted to about five thousand dollars.  Following the assignment Mr.\r\nDix left home, and he did not return until the spring or summer of\r\n1836.  Imprisonment for debt in a modified form then existed.  He and\r\nhis family were proud, and he may have wished to avoid seeing his\r\nneighbors and acquaintances while his misfortune was fresh upon him.\r\nHis wife was a granddaughter of General Ward, who had been the rival of\r\nGeneral Washington for the command of the army at the opening of the\r\nWar of the Revolution.  Mrs. Dix was proud, very properly, of her\r\npaternity, and of her grandfather's association with General\r\nWashington, and neither from her, nor from either of two brothers whom\r\nI subsequently met, did I ever hear a word of criticism upon the wisdom\r\nof the selection of General Washington.  Mrs. Dix had inherited many\r\nletters written by General Washington to her grandfather, and they were\r\nall written in a tone of sincere friendship.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dix's eldest brother, Mr. Nahum Ward, was one of the early\r\nsettlers, if not one of the founders of Marietta, Ohio.  Mr. Dix went\r\nto Marietta, where he was given some employment by Mr. Ward.  Neither\r\nMr. Butler nor Mr. Dix senior, had any knowledge of business, and I was\r\nemployed by them at a small advance in my pay, to sell the stock of\r\ngoods, and close the business of the store.  After such sales as could\r\nbe made, the remainder of the stock was sold at auction the 23d day of\r\nNovember.  During the preceding night there was a fall of snow, and the\r\ncompany came to the village in sleighs.  The winter was severe, and\r\nthe snow continued to cover the ground until the 18th of April, when\r\nthe stage coaches for the north went on runners for the last time.  The\r\nsummer of 1836 was so cold, that the corn crop was a failure.  During\r\nthe year following corn brought from New Jersey sold for $2.50 per\r\nbushel.\r\n\r\nIn 1835 the town of Groton was a place of much importance relatively.\r\nIt was the residence of several men of more than local fame.  Timothy\r\nFuller, the father of Margaret, was living there.  He was a lawyer of\r\nconsiderable distinction, and he had held important public positions.\r\nHe had been a representative and senator in the Massachusetts\r\nLegislature, speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives,\r\nand a member of Congress from the Cambridge district from 1817 to 1825.\r\nHe died in October, 1835.\r\n\r\nMr. Fuller was a man of careful and regular habits, indeed he belonged\r\nto a family noted for their devotion to the profession of law, and for\r\ntheir odd manners and styles of dress.\r\n\r\nMr. Fuller's eldest son, Eugene, was afterwards a student in the law\r\noffice of George F. Farley.  He was a good debater as a young man, but\r\nas a student rather irregular.  He went to New Orleans to reside,\r\nbecame an editor of, or writer on, the _Picayune_, and on a return\r\nvoyage from Boston he was lost overboard.\r\n\r\nMargaret Fuller continued to reside in Groton with her mother and the\r\nother members of the family for several years--until about 1841, I\r\nthink.  In the meantime I met her frequently, although she was several\r\nyears my senior.  She was a teacher in the Sunday school, and at the\r\nSunday-evening teachers' meetings she was accustomed to set forth her\r\nopinions with great frankness, and in a style which assumed that they\r\nwere not open to debate.  While she lived at Groton she contributed to\r\nthe _Dial_.\r\n\r\nIn personal appearance Margaret Fuller was less attractive than one\r\nmight imagine from the portraits and engravings now seen.  Her ability\r\nwas recognized, but the celebrity she attained finally was not\r\nanticipated, probably, by any of her town acquaintances.  Her writings\r\nmay justify the opinion that as a writer and thinker she is in the\r\nfront rank of American women.\r\n\r\nSamuel Dana, who had been a judge for many years, president of the\r\nMassachusetts Senate for three terms, and a member of Congress for one\r\nterm, was also a resident of Groton.  He had been an active politician\r\non the Democratic or Jeffersonian side in politics, and for many years\r\nin early life he had been the competitor of Timothy Bigelow, who had\r\nbeen a resident of Groton and a leader in the Federal Party of the\r\nState.  The town supported Bigelow and returned him to the House, where\r\nhe became speaker for many sessions.  Dana as a candidate for the\r\nMassachusetts Senate was elected by the county of Middlesex then\r\nDemocratic, and for three terms he was president of the Senate.  Judge\r\nDana was interested in a small social library that was kept in a\r\nchamber over the store.  It contained Josephus, Plutarch's Lives,\r\nRollins' Ancient History, and some other standard works whose titles I\r\ndo not now recall.\r\n\r\nJudge Dana was also interested in the organization of a reading room\r\nclub in a building connected with the store.  As clerk in charge of\r\nthe store I was custodian of the reading room and library.  I found\r\ntime to read Plutarch and Josephus, and I was skeptic enough to\r\nquestion in my own mind the passage in Josephus in regard to Jesus.\r\nJudge Dana died in the month of November, 1835, at the age of sixty.\r\nHis hair was white and long, and his appearance was so venerable that\r\nit is now difficult for me to realize that he was not seventy-five\r\nyears of age at least.  His abilities were considerable, and his\r\ndescendants, in more than one instance, have shown distinguished\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\nTwo other well-known lawyers, one of them a lawyer of eminence in the\r\nprofession, were also residents of the town; Benj. M. Farley and George\r\nF. Farley, brothers.  They were natives of the small town of Brookline,\r\nN. H.  The elder, Benj. M., had practised in Hollis, N. H., where by\r\neconomy and good care of his earnings he had acquired a competency.  At\r\nGroton he made no effort to obtain business, and acted for the most\r\npart as an associate or aid to his brother, who was in the enjoyment of\r\na large practice and income, for those days and parts.\r\n\r\nWith George F. Farley, whose age ran with the century, I was well\r\nacquainted from 1835 until his death in 1855.  He was one of the small\r\nnumber of men that I have known who underestimated their powers.  In\r\none respect, perhaps, this was not true of Farley.  He never appeared\r\nwanting in courage for any legal struggle with the leaders of the bar\r\nin New England.  In the twenty years that I knew him he had for his\r\nantagonists Webster, Choate, Davis, Curtis, Franklin, Dexter, and\r\nothers of eminence, and he never failed to sustain himself upon terms\r\nof equality.  This was remarkable in presence of the fact that he was\r\nlikely to be retained on the hard side of most cases.  This was due,\r\nperhaps, to his reputation for shrewdness, and for a quality in\r\npractice which has been called the inventive faculty.  When parties\r\nwere not allowed to testify, there was a wide field for the\r\nimagination, and for the exercise of the inventive faculties on the\r\npart of an advocate.  He had defended, successfully, the Ursuline\r\nConvent rioters, and he had been employed in many desperate cases on\r\nthe civil side and on the criminal side of the courts.\r\n\r\nIn his later years he read very little either in law, history, or\r\ngeneral literature.  His law library was meager, although he had\r\nusually one or two students in his office.  He preferred to discuss his\r\ncases with the loungers about the post-office and stores, getting\r\nthereby the benefit of the opinions of common men.\r\n\r\nHis manner in speaking was inartistic, and although he was a graduate\r\nof Harvard, he indulged himself in the use of country phrases and\r\nrustic pronunciation.  His logic was unanswerable, and his faculty of\r\ncross-examination of witnesses was worthy of emulation.\r\n\r\nHe enjoyed a few books, the classics in the originals, but he seldom\r\nindulged in a quotation.  Byron as a poet, and Locke as a logician he\r\ncommended to me--the latter, Locke on the Human Understanding, with\r\ngreat earnestness.  Under his advice I read it carefully, and for\r\nmental training he did not overvalue it.  Farley commenced the practice\r\nof his profession at New Ipswich, N. H., and that town elected him once\r\nor twice to the Legislature of the State.  Wishing for a wider field,\r\nhe came to Groton.  It was a day of small fees, and a good deal of the\r\nlitigation grew out of the intemperate habits of the farmers.\r\n\r\nIn New Hampshire fees were even more moderate than in Massachusetts.\r\nIf Farley had estimated his talents at their full value and had taken\r\nan office in Boston or New York, he could have gratified his love for\r\nmoney without disturbing his relations to his neighbors.  In minor ways\r\nhe was acquisitive and consequently there came to be a public sentiment\r\nwhich excluded him from public employments.  His political course was\r\nnot more erratic than that of many others, but his change of position\r\nwas ascribed to policy and not to principle.  In 1840 he was a Whig, in\r\n1850 he was a Free-soiler, and in 1855 he was a Republican.  In the\r\nautumn of the year 1855 he was elected a member of the State Convention\r\nof the Republican Party.\r\n\r\nA day or two before the meeting of the convention I was passing by his\r\npremises where he was engaged apparently in examining a buggy which his\r\nman had been putting in order.  The conversation turned upon politics,\r\nand I soon discovered that he wished for a nomination to the\r\nLegislature, and without admitting the fact, his remarks showed that he\r\ncomprehended the nature of the obstacles in his way.  At last he said:\r\n\"When I began I thought the main thing was to get money; and I have got\r\nit; and it is very convenient to have it, but it isn't just what I\r\nthought it was when I began.\"\r\n\r\nHe went to the convention, took a cold which developed into a fever,\r\nand in a week he died.\r\n\r\n[* When I became Secretary of the Treasury, in 1869, I appointed Hubbard\r\nto a minor office in the revenue service in the State of Kentucky,\r\nwhere he then lived.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\nGROTON IN 1835--(Continued)\r\n\r\nThere were two other lawyers in town, Caleb Butler, the postmaster, and\r\nBradford Russell.  Mr. Butler never appeared in court.  He gave advice\r\nin small matters, wrote deeds and wills, surveyed lands, and served his\r\nneighbors in fiduciary ways.  For many years he was a member, and a\r\nuseful member, of the Board of Commissioners for the County of\r\nMiddlesex.  That body laid out highways, superintended the public\r\nbuildings, and in a word did what no other authority in the county or\r\nState had a right to do.  Mr. Butler was a Whig, and after a time his\r\npolitics lost him the office of postmaster and the office of\r\ncommissioner.\r\n\r\nWith Bradford Russell I commenced the study of law, or rather I entered\r\nmy name with him and gave some night work to the study of books bearing\r\nupon the profession.  His office was over the store in which I became a\r\nclerk in December, 1835.  Russell was a graduate of Harvard, of the\r\nclass of 1818.  For many years two other members of that class resided\r\nat Groton--Dr. Joshua Green, and the Rev. Charles Robinson, pastor of\r\nthe old society, then ranked as Unitarian.  Mr. Russell had studied his\r\nprofession with Judge James Prescott, who was impeached and removed\r\nfrom the office of Judge of Probate for the county of Middlesex in the\r\nyear 1821.  Judge Prescott, whom I never saw, was a good lawyer in his\r\ntime, especially in the department of special pleading.  That branch of\r\nthe profession was then passing away, but there were lawyers who lived\r\nby their skill in preparing answers, rejoinders, sur-rejoinders,\r\nrebutters, and sur-rebutters.  Russell had acquired a large amount of\r\nspecial learning in the law, but he had no capacity to comprehend\r\nprinciples, nor could he see the application of old decisions to new\r\ncases.  In argument he was weak and inconclusive, but he was confident\r\nin his own powers, and favored as he was at times by the accidents and\r\nhazards of the profession, he gained some victories.  In the final\r\ntrials at the county court he usually secured the services of senior\r\ncounsel who could meet Farley, his usual antagonist, upon an equality\r\nof standing.  Most frequently he secured the services of Sam Mann of\r\nLowell, as he was then called.  The name of the town was affixed\r\ngenerally, as though the advocate had been so christened.\r\n\r\nMann was able, confident, and bold.  He died young, after a brilliant\r\ncareer.  In many cases Mann and Farley were associated.  When this\r\ncombination appeared, the opposing counsel were hard-pressed, usually.\r\nIn those days a story was set afloat which, though false, gave voice to\r\nthe popular notion.  When the court was held at Cambridge, Farley and\r\nMann boarded together at the Mansion House, Charlestown Square.  It was\r\nsaid that when they were associated in a case, they were in the habit\r\nof examining and cross-examining the witnesses.  On one of these\r\noccasions, as the story went, Mann conducted the examination, and\r\nFarley followed with the cross.  Under his hand the witnesses went to\r\npieces.  After the witnesses left, Farley said, \"We can never succeed\r\nif those are your witnesses.\"  Mann replied:  \"Oh, those are the\r\nwitnesses for the other side.  To-morrow evening I will show you my\r\nwitnesses.\"  When the evening came, the same witnesses came also.\r\nThey were again subject to examination and cross-examination, and\r\nproved impregnable under Farley's hand.  An invention, no doubt, and\r\nyet the story had a run.\r\n\r\nAlthough Russell was not a competitor in any sense with such\r\nantagonists as Farley and Mann, he was in the enjoyment of a practice\r\nthat was sufficient for a living, and a prudent man would have made it\r\nthe beginning of a moderate fortune.  He had neither skill in money\r\nmatters nor ordinary economy.  Hence he was always in debt.  At one\r\nterm of the court he entered fifty-eight writs, and there were terms\r\nwhen he had from seventy to one hundred cases on the docket.  Each of\r\nthese cases gave him thirty-three and one third cents costs for every\r\nday of the term.\r\n\r\nRussell held the office of Master in Chancery.  In 1838 the Insolvent\r\nLaw was enacted, and its administration was confided to Masters in\r\nChancery.  Russell soon gained a reputation for leniency in the matter\r\nof granting discharges to the insolvent debtors, and his business\r\nincreased rapidly.  His jurisdiction was the whole county, and although\r\nthere were several masters in the county, his fame was such that\r\npetitions came from Lowell, Waltham and other places where masters had\r\noffices.  I was appointed clerk in insolvency, at five dollars a day\r\nwhen a court was held.  In this way I gained some needed income,\r\nacquired a knowledge of the Insolvent Law, and more than all, I gained\r\nthe acquaintances of the leading lawyers of the county.  As debtors and\r\nwitnesses were examined, I may have gained something in practice.  The\r\nInsolvent Law, amended, to be sure, has remained on the statute books\r\nof Massachusetts to this day, and the United States Bankrupt Law was\r\nmodeled upon it.  Indeed, there can never by any wide departure from\r\nthe provisions of that statute, and from its principles no departure\r\nwhatever can be made.\r\n\r\nA leading man, and a character in the town, was Thomas A. Staples.  He\r\nwas a native of the neighboring town of Shirley.  He was a man of large\r\nsize, handsome figure, resolute in his purposes, and vindictive in his\r\nenmities.  His chief business was that of stage proprietor, and mail\r\ncontractor.  He was always in debt, and tardy, of course, in his\r\npayments.  He was involved in lawsuits, and many of his debts were paid\r\nupon executions.  His mail contracts were so large that he sublet many\r\nof the routes, and he was always in debt to sub-contractors.  He had a\r\nstage office in Boston for a time at the Hanover House, and after that\r\nat No. 9 Court Street.  His office was the headquarters of country\r\ntraders and others who patronized his lines of stages.  In the year\r\n1838 or later, I was in his office when Alvin Adams, the founder of the\r\nAdams Express Company, made his first trip to New York as an express\r\nmessenger.  Staples afterward stated in conversation that Adams had but\r\none parcel, and that he loaned him five dollars to meet his expenses.\r\nAt that time Harnden's express was in operation with an office at No. 8\r\nCourt Street.  Harnden's company disappeared in a few years, and the\r\nAdams Express Company became an institution that has the appearance of\r\nperpetuity.  At a time perhaps as late as 1850, I met Adams on\r\nWashington Street, when he expressed the opinion that his business was\r\nas profitable as any business in the country.\r\n\r\nStaples was engaged also in paper making with mills upon the upper\r\nfalls of the Squannacook River.  This branch of his business was\r\nespecially unfortunate, and in 1836 he assigned his property to Henry\r\nWoods, Daniel Shattuck, and Joshua B. Fowle.  Mr. Woods was a trader in\r\nwhose employment I then was, having let myself to him when I left the\r\nDix store December 1, 1835, for my board and $150 a year.  Agreement\r\nfor one year.  The assignees were all friends of Staples.  The last\r\nnamed was Calvin Childs, a blacksmith, to whom Staples owed about two\r\nthousand dollars.  The assignees proceeded to execute their trust, and\r\nas collections were made, payments were made until all the debts were\r\npaid except the debt to Childs.  Mr. Woods died in 1841.  Shattuck died\r\nin 1850, and the trust was not then executed.  Fowle paid Childs six\r\nhundred dollars, but he made no settlement of the trust.  In 1853\r\nChilds applied to Russell for counsel and assistance.  Russell filed a\r\nbill on the equity side of the court.  A lawyer, named Fiske, of\r\nBoston, was retained by Fowle.  Fiske answered.  Russell employed the\r\nHon. Charles R. Train to assist in the trial, but there was no hearing.\r\nIn 1858 Train was elected to Congress.  About 1860 Russell came to me\r\nfor assistance and put into my hands a large bundle of papers relating\r\nto the case.  At that time Russell was so impaired in health that he\r\ncould not aid in the investigation.  Upon an examination I found that\r\nthe testimony of Staples was important.  He then lived at Machias,\r\nMaine.  By writing and interviews when I found him in Boston, I became\r\nsatisfied that for a hidden reason he was resolved to have nothing to\r\ndo with the case.  As a last resort, I took out a commission and\r\nsubmitted interrogatories.  The answers were evasive or valueless from\r\nloss of memory.  Thus the case was delayed.  In 1862 I was elected to\r\nCongress.  Childs was an easy going man who made inquiries\r\noccasionally, but never complained.  Upon my return from a session,\r\nabout 1865, I resolved to bring the case to a close.  I examined the\r\npapers carefully, and I found full material for a statement, although\r\nit cost labor to analyze the accounts.  At that time Russell was dead\r\nand Fiske was dead.  Mr. John Loring, a former partner of Fiske, took\r\nthe case.  Loring agreed to a hearing at Chambers.  Chief Justice\r\nChapman named a day.  At the day named the clients and counsel\r\nappeared.  I presented my statement in writing.  Loring and Fowle said\r\nthey knew nothing about the matter.  My statement showed a balance of\r\nbetween $400 and $500 in Fowle's hands.  I asked for interest.  Fowle\r\nsaid he had been ready always to pay.  I contended it was his duty long\r\nbefore to have rendered an account, and made payment.  Judge Chapman,\r\nwith less reason than courts have usually for their decisions, held\r\nthat as he was always ready to pay, he was not justly chargeable with\r\ninterest.  I drew a decree, the judge signed it, Fowle paid, and Childs\r\nreturned home that night.  For ten years the case had been on the\r\ndocket, when, if some one had made an examination of the papers it\r\ncould have been disposed of in a day.\r\n\r\nThe controversy in New England between Trinitarians and Unitarians had\r\nculminated in Groton about the year 1825 in a division of the old town\r\nsociety and the organization of an orthodox church under the Rev. John\r\nTodd.  His successor, a Mr. Kittredge, had charge of the Society in\r\n1835, and for a short time afterwards.  He was succeeded by Dudley\r\nPhelps, who was a man of ability and liberal in his religious opinions.\r\nFrom 1838 to 1841 the post-office was in my charge, although I held the\r\noffice of postmaster only from February to April, 1841.  Mr. Phelps\r\nwas in the habit of sitting in the office and reading every sort of\r\nnewspaper from the _Trumpet_ to the _Investigator_.  Although he was\r\nmuch my senior, and of differing opinions in politics and religion our\r\nrelations were quite intimate.  For several years we were joint\r\nsubscribers for the four leading English reviews:--_Edinburgh, North\r\nBritish, Quarterly_ and _Westminster_.  My recollection is that he\r\nmade the dedicatory prayer at the new cemetery, and that he was the\r\nfirst person buried in it.  He was a man of talent and the father of\r\ntwo sons, who attained distinction at the bar in New York.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Charles Robinson was the pastor of the old society then\r\nUnitarian, but without question as to the plenary inspiration of the\r\nScriptures.  He was a graduate of Harvard, a man of learning, and a\r\nwriter of good sermons.  In the delivery he was faulty to the last\r\nstage of awkwardness.  His perceptive faculties were dull to a degree\r\nwithout parallel in my experience.\r\n\r\nIn 1835 and for some time afterwards, there were four taverns and\r\nthree stores at which intoxicating liquors were sold and the use of\r\nsuch liquors by farmers was greatly in excess of their use at the\r\npresent time.  In the early winter the country farmers from New\r\nHampshire and Vermont going to Boston, with butter, cheese, pork and\r\npoultry, patronized the taverns, and gave the town an appearance of\r\nbusiness which contrasts with the aspect of dullness that it now\r\nwears.  The prices for entertainment at the taverns were moderate,\r\nand none of the proprietors accumulated property.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\nBEGINNINGS IN BUSINESS\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1837 as my second year with Mr. Woods was approaching\r\na close, I informed him that I proposed to go to Exeter, N. H., attend\r\nthe Academy, and then either enter college or proceed with the study of\r\nthe law.  At about the same time I corresponded with Mr. Abbott, the\r\nprincipal of the Academy, in regard to terms, board, etc..  Upon this\r\nnotice Mr. Woods made me a proposition to continue with him and share\r\nthe business.  He offered to furnish the capital, to give me my board,\r\nand one fourth of the net profits.  My means were very small, the\r\nbusiness was quite sure to yield a profit, and the prospect of\r\ngaining a small amount of capital at the age of twenty-three, when the\r\npartnership was to end, controlled me and I accepted the proposition.\r\nThe partnership began March 1, 1838, when I was two months over twenty\r\nyears of age.  I had then been in Groton three years, and I had formed\r\nthe acquaintance of many young men in the Lyceum, in business and in\r\nsocial ways.  In connection with the Lyceum I prepared papers which I\r\nread as lectures.  One of these papers upon banking, signed B.,\r\nappeared in the Bay State _Democrat_, edited by Lewis Josselyn, the\r\npublisher.  Another upon Conservatism and Religion, was also printed in\r\nthe Bay State _Democrat_.  As I did not give my name to Mr. Josselyn,\r\nand as the letters were mailed at Groton, he came there and after\r\ninquiries, called upon me.  I admitted the authorship.  This\r\nacquaintance continued for many years, and for many years I was a\r\ncontributor to his paper.  He was elected secretary of the Senate in\r\n1843 by the Democratic Party.  A little later I wrote an article\r\ncalled \"Gibbet Hill\" in which I attempted to present the tradition\r\nconcerning the hill in Groton which bears that name.  That article was\r\nprinted in the _Yeoman's Gazette_ or the Concord _Freeman_.  For\r\nseveral years beginning about the year 1836, I wrote one paper each\r\nyear called a lecture.  Several of these papers were printed in Hunt's\r\n_Merchants' Magazine_.\r\n\r\nFrom 1835 to 1841 I occupied the store night and day and it was my\r\ncustom to read and write until twelve, one or two o'clock in the\r\nmorning.  These were my years of hard study.  Not infrequently, when\r\na tendency to sleep was too heavy for study, I bathed my face and head\r\nin cold water and thus revived my faculties--a practice, however, that\r\nI cannot commend.  Early in my residence in Groton, I formed the\r\nacquaintance and friendship of Dr. Amos B. Bancroft, a friendship which\r\ncontinued until his death in Italy in the year 1879.  It was with Dr.\r\nBancroft that I continued my studies in Latin.  In 1835, he had\r\nfinished his professional studies with Dr. Shattuck, of Boston, then\r\nan eminent physician.  Dr. Shattuck had studied his profession with Dr.\r\nAmos Bancroft, the father of Amos B.  Dr. Amos, as he was called, was\r\na graduate of Harvard College in the class of Wendell Phillips, and at\r\nthe close of his professional studies he was spoken of as the best\r\neducated physician who had entered the profession in Boston.  At the\r\ntime our acquaintance began, he was entering upon the practice of\r\nmedicine, at Groton, in place of his father, who was then about sixty-\r\nfive years of age, deaf, and not healthy in other respects, although he\r\nlived to the age of eighty years, and then died from an accident in\r\nState Street, Boston.  Dr. Bancroft, Sr., lived in a house which stood\r\nabout one hundred feet north of my present residence, and the office of\r\nDr. Amos was on the spot now occupied by the front of my house.  At the\r\nclose of business for the day, nine o'clock in the evening, I was in\r\nthe habit of going to the office and reciting my Latin lesson, after\r\nwhich we discussed other matters.  Upon my return to the store, I\r\nprepared myself for the next evening's recitation.  In this way I read\r\nCaesar and Virgil.  In a closet in Bancroft's office there was a\r\nskeleton.  That skeleton had a history, and possibly there may be a\r\nsequel to it.  It was understood to have been the skeleton of a man\r\nnamed Jack Frost, who was tried, convicted and executed at Worcester\r\nfor the crime of murder committed at or near Princeton.  Dr. Bancroft,\r\nSr., had been the owner of the skeleton.  Oftentimes I rode Sundays\r\nwith Dr. Amos.  On the occasion of one of these drives, and after the\r\ndeath of Dr. Bancroft, Sr., we passed the house of a waggish old man\r\nnamed Asa Tarbell.  After a little conversation Tarbell said, \"I shall\r\nbe over soon for Frost's skeleton.\"  Dr. Amos, amazed, looked over and\r\nthrough his glasses, and said, at length:  \"Why, what do you mean?\"\r\nSaid Tarbell:  \"Some years ago, your father and I were playing, and I\r\nproposed to put my uncle Ben against your Frost.  Your father agreed to\r\nthe game, and I won.  I told him I had no use for Frost at that time,\r\nand that he might keep him.\"  Tarbell's Uncle Ben was a man of inferior\r\nsize, hardly more than a dwarf, who had been a drummer boy in the\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nI bought the Bancroft estate in 1873, and my foreman, Mr. William A.\r\nChase informed me that he had found a skeleton, in a barrel in a shed,\r\nand that he had buried it on the place.  If again found it may lead to\r\nthe suspicion that it is the skeleton of a murdered man, and not that\r\nof a murderer.\r\n\r\nFrom 1835 to 1841, I read Locke, Say's Political Economy, Smith's\r\nWealth of Nations, Plutarch, Josephus, Herodotus, Lingard, Hume and\r\nSmollett, Cicero, Demosthenes, Homer, Pope, Byron, Shakespeare,\r\nBoswell's Johnson, Junius, The Tattler, The Rambler, the English\r\nReviews, French from text-books without a teacher and Rhetoric (Blair's\r\nfull edition).  Much of Blair's Rhetoric I studied carefully and with\r\ngreat benefit.  Some of my papers of those days were written and re-\r\nwritten four times.  On the law side I read a few text-books:\r\nBlackstone, Story on the Constitution, The Federalist, De Lohme on the\r\nBritish Constitution, and some other works, probably, which I do not at\r\nonce recall.  If I gained some knowledge of the law as practised in the\r\ncountry, that knowledge was gained from an acquaintance with the\r\nlawyers and from my opportunities as Clerk of the Insolvency Court.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1836, July 4, an Act was passed by Congress, granting to\r\na class of widows of soldiers of the War of the Revolution, a pension\r\nfor a term of five years.  The towns of Groton, Pepperell and Shirley\r\nhad supplied a large number of soldiers, and there were many widows who\r\nwere entitled to the benefits of the Act.  My acquaintance as clerk was\r\nalready large, and my studies with Russell had given me the faculty of\r\npreparing ordinary papers, and I at once commenced canvassing for the\r\nbusiness.  I obtained in all about fifty cases under the Act of 1836.\r\nSubsequently I obtained other cases under the Act of 1838.  I sent the\r\napplications forward to Washington, and in a few cases certificates\r\nwere received in return.  In a majority of cases there was a delay.\r\nThe women became anxious and their visits and importunities were\r\nannoying.  In the month of January, 1839, I joined Gen. Staples and\r\nmade a visit to Washington.  Staples' object was to make mail\r\ncontracts, or to arrange existing difficulties.  My purpose was to\r\nobtain action on pension applications.  Our journey was a slow one, if\r\nnot tedious.  From Groton to Boston by stage, and from Boston to\r\nStonington, Conn., by rail; from Stonington to New York by steamboat;\r\nfrom New York to Perth Amboy by steamboat; from Perth Amboy by rail, I\r\nthink, but possibly by stage to a town on the Delaware River, Franklin\r\nperhaps.  From that point to Philadelphia, by steamboat.  Our journey\r\nfrom Philadelphia to Washington was by rail in part and in part by\r\nstage.  We passed the creeks between the Susquehanna and Baltimore upon\r\na railroad.\r\n\r\nWe stopped overnight in New York, and went to the Park Theater.\r\nAnother night we spent in Philadelphia, and went to the Chestnut Street\r\nTheater.  Staples had a fondness for theaters, and on these occasions\r\nI followed his example.  I had been in a theater but one, when I saw\r\nForrest in Boston, in King Lear.  At Philadelphia I bought a copy of\r\nByron for three dollars.  That volume I have yet.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. William Parmenter, a Democrat, then represented the district\r\nin Congress, and I carried one or more letters to him--one from my\r\nemployer Mr. Henry Woods, who was an active Democrat.  Mr. Parmenter\r\nwas then about fifty years of age, of heavy frame, swarthy in\r\ncomplexion, and a man of good natural abilities.  He took me to Mr.\r\nVan Buren.  We found him alone, well dressed, polite and rather\r\ngracious than otherwise.  Quite early in my visit, Mr. Parmenter took\r\nme to the Pension Office, then presided over by Mr. Edwards.  Mr.\r\nParmenter stated his business, and immediately attention was given to\r\nmy applications.  In the course of a few days some of the cases were\r\ndisposed of, and in a few weeks my docket was clear.\r\n\r\nCaleb Butler was then postmaster at Groton.  He had had the place,\r\nprobably from the days of John Quincy Adams, for as he was a violent\r\nWhig, he could not have received his appointment from General Jackson.\r\nMy employer, Mr. Woods, was an applicant for the post-office, he being\r\nthe only Democrat in the street who had accommodations for the office.\r\nI carried papers in support of the application.  Those I gave probably\r\nto Mr. Parmenter, as I have no recollection of any interview with any\r\npost-office official.  Amos Kendall was then Postmaster-General.  He\r\nwas a native of Dunstable, and he had been a student at the Groton\r\nAcademy when Mr. Butler was the preceptor.  Naturally and properly he\r\nsustained his old teacher.  The change however was made, and upon the\r\nexpress instructions of Mr. Van Buren it was said.  Mr. Woods retained\r\nthe office until his death in January, 1841, when I was appointed\r\nwithout any agency of my own, but by the agency as I supposed of Gen.\r\nStaples.  Upon the election of General Harrison I was removed in the\r\nmonth of April, and Mr. Butler was reappointed, an act of which I\r\nnever complained, nor had I any reason to complain.\r\n\r\nAt Washington we stopped at Gadsby's Hotel, now the National.  There I\r\nmet and had some acquaintance with Matthew L. Davis, \"the Spy in\r\nWashington\" as he called himself.  He was a newspaper correspondent and\r\nthe biographer of Aaron Burr.  He was a great admirer of Burr.  Davis\r\nwore very thin clothing, scouted overcoats, and boasted that he slept\r\nalways in a room with open windows, and under very light bed clothing.\r\nHe was old and conceited, and as a permanent companion, he could not\r\nhave been otherwise than disagreeable.\r\n\r\nAt the Supreme Court I heard arguments by Webster and Crittenden, on\r\nopposite sides.  In the Senate I heard Webster, Clay, Calhoun, and\r\nothers in running debate, but not in prepared speeches.  The Senate\r\nthen contained many other men of note.  Silas Wright, of New York;\r\nPreston, of South Carolina; Benton, of Missouri; Linn, of Missouri,\r\nmore remarkable for personal beauty than talents.  In the House Mr.\r\nAdams was then a chief figure.  His contest over the right of petition\r\nhad commended him to one portion of the country, and made him the\r\nobject of hostility to another portion.  I recall one Monday, when he\r\nhad the right to present petitions, and although they were laid on the\r\ntable without debate he was able to consume time by presenting them\r\nsingly.  As the supply in his hands and on the table seemed\r\ninexhaustible, a compromise was made finally, and the petitions went in\r\nin a mass.  Of other speakers that I heard I recall Henry A. Wise, and\r\nSergeant S. Prentiss.  Of their style and quality I can say nothing.\r\nThe reported speeches of Prentiss do not justify the reputation that he\r\nenjoyed as an orator when living.\r\n\r\nThe incident which produced the most lasting impression upon me, when\r\nin Washington, was an interview with a slave, a woman fifty years or\r\nmore of age.  I had then no love for the system of slavery.  I had read\r\nClarkson's and Wilberforce's writings, and I knew the history of the\r\nstruggle in England for the abolition of the slave trade, and slavery\r\nin the British West Indies.  I had also attended some anti-slavery\r\nmeetings in Massachusetts, at which the leaders, Phillips, Garrison,\r\nFoster, Parker, and Pillsbury had denounced the institution.  Groton\r\nwas a center of anti-slavery operations in that part of the State.\r\nSeveral copies of the _Liberator_ were taken in the town, and anti-\r\nslavery meetings were held not infrequently.  The first speech that\r\nGeorge Thompson made in America was made in Groton.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday morning I walked out towards what is now called the Island.\r\nThe road was marked by a rail fence, but of buildings there were none.\r\nI went so far that I was near the slave pen, a building now standing\r\nand which I have visited within a few years.  It was of brick, enclosed\r\nwithin a brick wall, and all of a dingy straw color.  At a short\r\ndistance from the building, I met a black woman walking slowly away\r\nfrom it.  I said to her:  \"What building is that?\"  At once she was in\r\ntears, and she said:  \"That is the pen where the poor black people are\r\nkept who are going down to Louisiana.\"  She had then been to visit her\r\ndaughter, a girl of about eighteen years of age, according to the\r\nmother's statement, who was to leave the next morning.  She was the\r\nlast of a family of nine as the woman said, who had been sold and taken\r\naway from her.  As I was leaving I said:  \"Who is your master?\"  She\r\nanswered:  \"Mr. Blair, of the _Globe_.\"  In the fourteen years of my\r\nmanhood, that I acted with the Democratic party, I never said anything\r\nin favor of the system of slavery.  If otherwise I might have done so,\r\nthe interview with that old woman would have restrained me.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\nFIRST EXPERIENCE IN POLITICS\r\n\r\nAt the spring election of Groton in 1839, I was chosen a member of the\r\nschool committee.  The other members had been in the service in\r\nprevious years.  They were the Rev. Charles Robinson, the Rev. Mr.\r\nKittredge, Dr. Joshua Green, and Dr. George Stearns.  In the early\r\nColonial period the \"minister\" was often the schoolmaster also.\r\nNaturally he took an interest in the education of the children, and\r\nprevious to the time when school committees were required by statute,\r\nhe was the self-constituted guide of the teachers and schools.  Indeed,\r\nthe schools were parochial.  Whenever the minister visited a school he\r\nmade a prayer, and the morning exercise in reading was in the New\r\nTestament Scriptures--two verses by each pupil.  In 1840 the entire\r\nboard was rejected, and a board composed of school teachers and non-\r\nprofessional men was chosen.\r\n\r\nIn 1838 the Massachusetts Legislature passed what was known as the\r\nFifteen-Gallon Law.  The statute prohibited the sale of distilled\r\nspirits in \"less quantity than fifteen gallons.\"  It did not take\r\neffect immediately and the election of that year was not seriously\r\ndisturbed, but before the autumn of 1839 the State was thoroughly\r\naroused.  A cry was raised that it was a law to oppress the poor who\r\ncould not command means to purchase the quantity named, while the rich\r\nwould enjoy the use of liquor notwithstanding the statute.  The town of\r\nGroton was entitled to two members in the house of representatives.\r\nBoth parties nominated candidates who favored the repeal of the\r\nFifteen-Gallon Law.  The temperance voters put a ticket in the field,\r\nthe Rev. Amasa Sanderson, the minister of the Baptist Society, then a\r\nnew organization, and feeble in numbers and wealth, and myself.  At\r\nthat time my associations were largely with Whigs, but I was opposed to\r\na national bank, and in favor of free trade.  With those views it was\r\nnot possible for me to act with the Whig Party on national questions\r\nor in national contests.  Mr. Sanderson and I received about seventy-\r\nsix votes, and as none of the candidates had a majority, the town was\r\nunrepresented.\r\n\r\nEdward Everett was Governor when the law was passed, and he was a\r\ncandidate for re-election in 1839.  I supported Mr. Everett on the\r\ntemperance issue against Judge Marcus Morton, who was the candidate of\r\nthe Democratic Party.  Judge Morton had been on the bench of the\r\nSupreme Judicial Court where he had the reputation of an able judge by\r\nthe side of Shaw, Wilde and Putnam.  At that time I had not seen\r\nMorton or Everett.  In the year 1836 or 1837 I went to Boston to hear\r\nAlex. H. Everett deliver a Democratic Fourth of July oration.  The\r\neffort was a disappointment to me.  A. H. Everett had a reputation as\r\nan orator, but he was far inferior to his brother Edward.  In later\r\nyears I heard Edward Everett often.  His genius in preparation and in\r\nthe delivery of his orations and speeches was quite equal to anything\r\nwe can imagine at Athens and by Athenian orators, excepting only the\r\nforce of his argument.\r\n\r\nIn 1851 or 1852 I was present at an agricultural fair at Northampton\r\nand in company with Mr. Everett.  After dinner speeches were made.\r\nWhen we rode to the fair grounds in the morning a dense river fog\r\ncovered the valley but at ten o'clock it lifted, and the day became\r\nclear.  At the dinner Mr. Everett in his speech described the morning,\r\nthe dense fog, the lifting, the sun illuminating first the hills and\r\nthen the valleys, revealing the spires of the churches, etc.  For the\r\nmoment I was deceived.  But when he had concluded I saw him hand his\r\nmanuscript to a reporter and the speech appeared the next morning,\r\nverbatim as he had delivered it.  He knew the river towns, and he knew\r\nthat every fair day in autumn was preceded by a dense fog, and the\r\nspeech was written upon that theory.  What alternative he had prepared\r\nin case of a rain, I know not.\r\n\r\nAs a judge, and at the same time the candidate of the Democratic Party\r\nfor Governor for many years, the rank and file of the party came to\r\nregard Judge Morton as a man of fine abilities and sterling integrity.\r\nHis abilities were sturdy rather than attractive.  In this respect he\r\nwas the opposite of Governor Everett.  In the canvass of 1839 Morton\r\nwas elected by one vote in a contest of unusual warmth.  This election\r\nremoved him from the bench, much to his regret, it was said, as under\r\nthe circumstances he could hardly hope for a re-election.  The House\r\nand Senate were controlled by the Whigs, and the Governor was\r\nsurrounded by a council composed of Whigs.  The Fifteen-Gallon Law was\r\nrepealed and in other respects the government was not different from\r\nwhat it would have been had Mr. Everett been re-elected.\r\n\r\nGovernor Morton continued to be the Democratic candidate, and though\r\ndefeated in 1840 and 1841 by John Davis, he was again elected in 1843\r\nby the Legislature, there having been no choice by the people, a\r\nmajority being required.  The Senate was Democratic by a considerable\r\nmajority.  The House was equally divided at the opening of the session,\r\nand there were four abolitionists who held the balance of power.  After\r\nseveral trials the Whigs succeeded in electing Daniel P. King of\r\nDanvers, by the help of one or more of the abolitionists.  There were\r\nseveral contested seats, and when the house had been purged, as the\r\nprocess was called, the Democrats were in a majority.  The session was\r\na short one.  A few political measures were passed, salaries were\r\nreduced, and much below a reasonable compensation for those days even.\r\nGovernor Morton had a Democratic Council, but they were not agreed in\r\npolicy and the administration lost strength even with Democrats.  Its\r\ndefeat in the autumn was inevitable, and Gov. Morton ceased to be a\r\ncandidate for an office that he had sought in twenty elections and\r\ngained in two.  With others I lost confidence in his ability, but that\r\nconfidence I afterwards regained.\r\n\r\nHe was a member of the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention of 1853,\r\nand in that body his ability was conspicuous.  His style was clear and\r\nlogical, and his processes of reasoning were legal and judicial in\r\ncharacter.  In his speeches he avoided authorities and spurned notes.\r\nHe prepared himself by reading and reflection, and the arrangement was\r\ndictated by the logic of the case.  His speeches were the speeches of a\r\nstrong man, and he was a dangerous antagonist in debate.  His reasoning\r\nwas faultless and he kept his argument free from all surplus matter.\r\n\r\nIn a conversation that I once had with him at his home in Taunton, he\r\nsaid that the best legal argument to which he had ever listened was\r\nmade by Samuel Dexter.  As Governor Morton had heard Pinckney, Wirt,\r\nWebster, Mason, Choate, Curtis and many others, the praise of Dexter\r\nwas not faint praise.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\nTHE ELECTION OF 1840\r\n\r\nIn the early summer of 1840 the great contest began, which ended in the\r\ndefeat of Mr. Van Buren and the election of Gen. Harrison to the\r\nPresidency.  The real issues were not much discussed--certainly not by\r\nthe Whigs.  In reality the results were due to the general prostration\r\nof business and the utter discredit that had fallen upon General\r\nJackson's pet bank system.  The Independent Treasury System, as it was\r\ntermed by Democrats, or the Sub-Treasury System, as it was called by\r\nthe Whigs, had not been tested.\r\n\r\nThe country was tired of experiments and all the evils, which were\r\nmany, that then afflicted the people, were attributed to the\r\nexperiments of General Jackson in vetoing the bills for the recharter\r\nof the United States Bank and for the institution of the pet bank\r\nsystem.  In truth the country was wedded to the idea that the funds of\r\nthe government should be so placed that they could be used to\r\nfacilitate business.  That idea and the practice arising from it were\r\nfull of peril.  In the infancy of a country, when the resources are\r\ninadequate, a national bank, assuming that it is managed honestly and\r\nwisely, may be an important aid, but time being given, it will\r\ninevitably become a political machine in a country, like the United\r\nStates, where the political aspirations of the people are active and\r\nthe temptations to seek the aid of the money power are always great.\r\nEven in modern time, with a surplus of millions in the banks of the\r\ncity of New York, for which no proper use could be found, there are\r\nindications of a purpose to return to the pet bank system under\r\nanother name.\r\n\r\nGen. Harrison, the nominee of the Whig Party, was then sixty-seven\r\nyears of age by the record, but the public opinion credited him with\r\nseveral more years.  His mental powers were not of superior quality,\r\nand his life had not been of a sort to develop his faculties.  He had\r\ndone good service in the Indian wars of the frontier and as commander\r\nin the battle of Tippecanoe he had won a reputation as a soldier.\r\nDuring the war of 1812, he commanded the army of the Northwest, and\r\nwith honor.  He had had a seat in each House of Congress, he had\r\nrepresented the government at the capital of a South American Republic,\r\nand all with credit, and all without distinction.  His career had been\r\nsufficiently conspicuous to justify his friends in eulogies in the\r\nparty papers and speeches; and neither as good policy nor just\r\ntreatment should his opponents have been betrayed into criticisms of\r\nhis military and civil life.  The Democrats were unwise enough to raise\r\nan issue upon his military career, and the result was greatly to their\r\nloss.  His frontier life in a log cabin was also the subject of\r\nridicule at the opening of the campaign.  The Whigs accepted the issue,\r\nbuilt log cabins on wheels and drew them over the country from one mass\r\nmeeting to another.  The unfortunate remark was made by a writer or\r\nspeaker that if Harrison had a log cabin and plenty of hard cider he\r\nwould be content.  A barrel became the emblem of the Whig Party.  The\r\nlog cabin was furnished with a cider barrel at the door, and the\r\nemblematic barrel was seen on cane heads and breast pins.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster struck a fatal blow at the error of the Democratic Party:\r\n--\"Let him be the log cabin candidate.  What you say in scorn we will\r\nshout with all our lungs. * * * It did not happen to me to be born in a\r\nlog cabin; but my elder brother and sisters were born in a log cabin\r\nraised amid the snow drifts of New Hampshire, at a period so early that\r\nwhen the smoke first rose from its rude chimney and curled over the\r\nfrozen hills there was no similar evidence of a white man's habitation\r\nbetween it and the settlements on the rivers of Canada. * * * If ever I\r\nam ashamed of it, or if I ever fail in affectionate remembrance of him\r\nwho reared it, and defended it against savage violence and destruction,\r\ncherished all the domestic virtues beneath its roof, and through the\r\nfire and blood of a seven years' Revolutionary war, shrunk from no\r\ndanger, no toil, no sacrifice to save his country and to raise his\r\nchildren to a condition better than his own, may my name and the name\r\nof my posterity be blotted forever from the memory of mankind.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Tyler of Virginia, was placed on the Whig ticket as the candidate\r\nfor Vice-President.  Tyler had been a Democrat and the opinions of the\r\nStates Rights wing of the Democratic Party were his opinions,\r\nnotwithstanding his associations with the Whig Party.  His nomination\r\nwas due to the disposition to balance the ticket by selecting one of\r\nthe candidates from each wing of the party--and there are always two\r\nwings to a party.\r\n\r\nOf poetry the Whig writers furnished much more than was enjoyed by\r\nDemocrats.  An effort was made to stay the tide in favor of Harrison\r\nby poetry as well as by argument.  The effort was fruitless.  The\r\ncontest of 1840 had its origin in the most distressing financial\r\ndifficulties that ever rested upon the country, and it was conducted\r\non the part of the Whigs by large expenditure of money, for those days,\r\nand with a degree of hilarity and good nature that it is difficult now\r\nto realize.  This may have been due to general confidence, and to a\r\nconsequent belief that a change of administration would be followed by\r\ngeneral prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs were not under the necessity of submitting arguments to their\r\nfollowers, and the arguments of Democrats were of no avail.  The Whig\r\npapers in all parts of the country contained lists of names of\r\nDemocrats who were supporting General Harrison.  Occasionally the\r\nDemocratic papers could furnish a short list of Whigs who declared for\r\nVan Buren in preference to Harrison.  The most absurd stories were told\r\nof the administration, and apparently they were accepted as truth.\r\nCharles J. Ogle, of Pennsylvania, delivered a speech in the House of\r\nRepresentatives in which he marshaled all the absurd stories that were\r\nafloat.  He charged among other things that Van Buren had sets of gold\r\nspoons.  The foundation for the statement was the fact that there were\r\nspoons in the Executive Mansion that were plated or washed with gold on\r\nthe inside of the bowls.  The spoons were there in General Grant's\r\ntime, but so much like brass or copper in appearance that one would\r\nhesitate about using them.  Another idle story believed by the masses\r\nwas that the Navy bought wood in New Orleans at a cost of twenty-four\r\ndollars a cord and carried it to Florida for the use of the troops\r\nduring the Seminole war of 1837-8.  Isaac C. Morse, of Louisiana, was\r\none of the Congressional bearers or mourners at the funeral of John\r\nQuincy Adams, in 1848.  He was a Whig member and his district in 1840\r\nwas on the Texas frontier.  At one of the evening sessions of mourning,\r\nwhile the Committee was in Boston, he gave an account of his campaign,\r\nand he recited a speech made by a young orator who went out with him as\r\nan aid.  The speech opened thus:  \"Fellow Citizens; who is Daniel\r\nWebster?  Daniel Webster is a man up in Massachusetts making a\r\ndictionary.  Who is General Harrison?  Everybody knows who General\r\nHarrison is.  He is Tippecanoe and Tyler too.  But who is Martin Van\r\nBulen?  Martin Van Bulen!  He is the man who bought the wood in the\r\nOrleans, paid twenty-four dollars a cord for it, carried it round to\r\nFlorida and had to cut down the trees to land it.\"  A fellow in the\r\ncrowd cried out, \"Carrying coals to Newcastle.\"  \"Yes,\" said the\r\nspeaker, \"them coals he carried to Newcastle.  I don't know so much\r\nabout the coals, but about the wood I've got the documents.\"\r\n\r\nThe general public was not only disposed to accept every wild\r\nstatement, but the average intelligence was much below the present\r\nstandard, and the means of communication were poor.  If, however,\r\nthere had been no canvass, the overthrow of Van Buren would have\r\noccurred.  The defeat of the United States Bank, and the failure of\r\nthe pet bank system, had been attended by disorders in the finances,\r\nthe ruin of manufactures, a reduction in wages, with all the incident\r\nevils.  As these evils were coincident in time with the measures, the\r\nmeasures were treated as the guilty cause.  Beyond question, Mr. Clay's\r\ntariff bill contributed to the troubles.\r\n\r\nGeorge Bancroft, the historian, was then collector of the port of\r\nBoston.  He took an active part in the canvass in Massachusetts.\r\nOn the evening of Saturday previous to the election in Massachusetts,\r\nhe spoke at Groton in a building afterwards known as Liberty Hall.*\r\n\r\nMr. Bancroft had a full House, but not an enthusiastic one.  Many of\r\nhis hearers were Whigs, who came from the country, but not to cheer the\r\nspeaker.  Moreover, the news of the New York election, then held the\r\nfirst three days of the week, was not encouraging to Democrats.  After\r\nthe meeting Mr. Bancroft was taken to the tavern, where a supper was\r\nserved to him and to a small number of Democrats.  Mr. Bancroft was\r\nexcited, and walking the room he said:--\"I do believe if General\r\nHarrison is elected, Divine Providence will interfere and prevent his\r\never becoming President of the United States.\"  These words of\r\ndisappointment seemed prophecy, when the death of Harrison occurred\r\nwithin thirty days after his inauguration.\r\n\r\nIn his address Mr. Bancroft spoke with great confidence of the vote of\r\nNew York.  There were some conscientious Democrats in his audience, who\r\nremembered the remarks, and it was with great reluctance that they gave\r\nhim their votes when he was a candidate for Governor in 1844.\r\n\r\nThe more considerate members of the Democratic Party apprehended defeat\r\nfrom the opening of the canvass.  As early as June 17, the Whigs had\r\nenormous mass meetings at Boston and Bunker Hill.  The Democrats were\r\nnot inert.  The Governor of the State was a Democrat and there were\r\nthose who had hopes of his re-election.  In set-off of the great\r\nmeeting of the 17th of June at Charlestown, the Democrats prepared for\r\na similar meeting on Lexington Green, July 4.  The concourse of people\r\nwas large.  Governor Morton was present and spoke.  I there met William\r\nD. Kelley, who spoke to a portion of the crowd from a wagon.  He was\r\nthen employed in a jeweler's establishment in Boston.\r\n\r\nGroton sent a company of volunteers for the day numbering about\r\nseventy-five men, under command of Captain William Shattuck, then a\r\nsturdy Democrat and afterwards an equally sturdy Republican.  Shattuck\r\nwas the grandson of Captain Job Shattuck, of Shays' Rebellion.  Job\r\nShattuck had been a captain in the War of the Revolution, and he was\r\nalways an earnest patriot.  He was also a man of wealth, having large\r\npossessions in land, and being wholly exempt from the pecuniary\r\ndistresses that harassed the majority of men, from the close of the\r\nwar to the close of the century.  Job Shattuck's action was due to his\r\nsympathy for the sufferers and to his sense of justice.  In every town\r\nthere were traders and small capitalists who had supplied the families\r\nof soldiers who were absent in the service.\r\n\r\nEither by mortgage or by executions, the creditors had secured liens\r\nupon the homesteads of the soldiers and from 1783 to 1789 the liens\r\nwere enforced.  Petitions went up to the General Court for a stay act.\r\nJames Bowdoin was Governor.  The General Court did not listen to the\r\nappeal.  Daniel Shays and others organized forces for the suppression\r\nof the Courts.  Shattuck was the leader in the county of Middlesex,\r\nand at the head of his force he broke up the Court at Concord.  Finally\r\nhe was arrested.  Major Woods, who had been an officer in the war, was\r\nin command of the Government forces.  Shattuck was secreted at the\r\nhouse of one Gregg, who lived near where the house of John Gilson now\r\nstands.  The season was winter.  It was believed that Gregg betrayed\r\nShattuck.  When Shattuck discovered his peril, he fled and made his\r\nway toward the Nashua River, which was then frozen.  His pursuers\r\nfollowed, but at unequal pace.  When he had crossed the river, he saw\r\nthat the three men in sight were widely separated from each other.\r\nShattuck turned, and for a time he became the pursuer.  The first man\r\nran, then the second, but finally Shattuck fell on the ice, with\r\nsword in hand.  His pursuers seized him.  Upon his refusal to surrender\r\nhis sword, they cut the cords of his hand, and wounded him in the leg.\r\nHe was tried, sentenced to be hanged, and confined in the jail at\r\nConcord.\r\n\r\nThe election of 1786 turned upon the questions at issue, and especially\r\nupon the execution of the persons under sentence.  Bowdoin was the\r\ncandidate of the \"Law-and-Order Party,\" and John Hancock was nominated\r\nby the friends of the convicts.  Hancock was elected by a vote of about\r\nnineteen thousand against less than six thousand for Bowdoin.  The\r\nconvicts were pardoned, and a stay law was passed.  The demand of the\r\nShays men was reasonable, and the Government was guilty of a criminal\r\nerror in resisting it.\r\n\r\nThe Shays Rebellion was beneficial to Massachusetts, and it contributed\r\nto the argument in favor of the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe town of Groton continued in the control of Shattuck and his friends\r\nfor many years after the suppression of the Rebellion.  During that\r\nperiod he was drawn as a juror.  When his name was called the judge\r\nrepeated it, and said, \"Job Shattuck!  He can't sit on the jury in this\r\nCourt.\"  As Shattuck came out of the seat limping he said:  \"I have\r\nbroken up one Court here, and things won't be right, until I break up\r\nanother.\"\r\n\r\nSomething of the spirit of Job Shattuck has been exhibited in the\r\nlarger portion of his numerous descendants.  They have been devoted to\r\nliberty and just in their dealings.  These two qualities were\r\nconspicuous in his grandson, Captain William Shattuck.\r\n\r\nI took part in the canvass of 1840 and made speeches in Groton and in\r\nseveral of the towns in the vicinity.  I was also the candidate of the\r\nDemocratic Party for a seat in the House of Representatives.  There was\r\nno opposition for the nomination, although there were many Democrats\r\nwho thought my defection the preceding year had prevented the election\r\nof the Democratic candidates.  My temperance opinions were offensive to\r\nmany, if not to a majority of the party.  On the other hand there were\r\na number of young members of the Whig Party whose votes I could\r\ncommand.  As a final fact, the political feeling was then so strong\r\nthat all considerations yielded to the chances and hopes of success.\r\n\r\nMy opponent, and the successful candidate, was Mr. John Boynton,\r\nafterward, and for a single year, a member of the senate.  He was a\r\nnative of the town, a blacksmith by trade, and the son of a blacksmith.\r\nHe was a man of quiet ways, upright, and known to every voter.  He had\r\nbeen in the office of town clerk for many years, he had been kind to\r\neveryone, and he had no enemies.  Boynton was elected, but by a\r\nmoderate majority.  But for the excitement of the Presidential\r\nelection, the contest would have been very close.\r\n\r\nThe death of General Harrison and the elevation of John Tyler to the\r\nPresidency wrought a great change in the fortunes of the Whig Party.\r\nSoon after the assembling of Congress at the extra session, called by\r\nPresident Harrison, a bill for a Fiscal Bank was passed by the two\r\nHouses, and vetoed by President Tyler.  The veto message was so framed\r\nas to encourage the Whig leaders to pass a second bill in a form\r\ndesigned to avoid the objections of the President.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion upon the veto of the first bill, Mr. Clay assailed\r\nthe President in such terms that a reconciliation was impossible.  From\r\nthat moment it was the purpose of the President to co-operate with the\r\nDemocratic Party.  A second bill was passed.  That was also vetoed by\r\nthe President.  Early in September all the members of the Cabinet\r\nresigned except Mr. Webster.  The outgoing members gave reasons to the\r\npublic, and Mr. Webster gave reasons for not going.  Caleb Cushing,\r\nHenry A. Wise, and a few other Whigs, called the Omnibus Party chose\r\ntheir part with Webster and Tyler.  The Whig Party was divided,\r\nhopelessly.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the division, a bill had passed, which had been approved by\r\nthe President, for the repeal of the Independent Treasury System.  The\r\nardor of its enemies was such that no substitute was provided.  The\r\nexpectation was that a Fiscal Bank, or Fiscal Agent, would be created.\r\nThe failure of the bank bills left the Government without any lawful\r\nsystem of finance.  The pet bank system was restored, in fact.  The\r\nrupture in the Whig Party contributed to its defeat in Massachusetts\r\nat the election in 1842, but the party was so compact in 1841 that its\r\ntriumph was assured.  Mr. Webster defended his course, and with few\r\nexceptions his conduct was either approved or tolerated in\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\n[* It was then an unfinished building and stood where the Willow Dale\r\nroad connects with Hollis Street.  The building had been erected by a\r\nbody of people who advocated the union of all the churches.  They\r\ncalled themselves Unionists.  Their leader was the Rev. Silas Hawley.\r\nHe was a vigorous thinker, a close reasoner, and he displayed great\r\nknowledge of the Bible.  His following became considerable.  The\r\nexcitement extended to the neighboring towns and for a time serious\r\ninroads were made upon the churches of the village.\r\n\r\nThe no-creed doctrine was accepted by some who never believed in any\r\ncreed, and by others who had believed in creeds that they then thought\r\nwere false.  In the year 1838, Hawley convened a \"World's Convention\"\r\nat Liberty Hall, called by the wicked \"Polliwog Chapel,\" to consider\r\nthe subject of uniting all the churches in one church without a creed.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon early in the week of the session, I saw three men walking\r\non the street towards Liberty Hall, with knapsacks buckled on their\r\nbacks.  One of these was Theodore Parker, one George Ripley, and the\r\nthird, I think, was Charles A. Dana.  In this I may be in error.\r\nParker told me in after years when he had a wide-spread reputation,\r\nthat his first public speech was made in that convention.]\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\nMASSACHUSETTS MEN IN THE FORTIES\r\n\r\nIn 1841 I was again a candidate for the House, and I was elected by the\r\nmeager majority of one vote.  As a member for the year 1842 I made the\r\nacquaintance of many persons, some of whom became distinguished in\r\nstate and national politics.  The leading members on the Democratic\r\nside were Samuel C. Allen of Northfield; Nathaniel Hinckley of\r\nBarnstable; Seth Whitmarsh, of Seekonk; Seth J. Thomas, Richard\r\nFrothingham of Charlestown; and James Russell, of West Cambridge.\r\nAllen was a son of the Samuel C. Allen who had been a member of\r\nCongress, a member of the old Republican Party of Jefferson, and the\r\nauthor of the saying:  \"Associated wealth is the dynasty of modern\r\nstates.\"  Another son was Elisha Allen, who was then a member of\r\nCongress from Maine, elected in 1840.  He was afterwards our\r\nCommissioner to the Sandwich Islands, and subsequently he was Minister\r\nfrom the Islands to the United States.\r\n\r\nSamuel C. Allen, Jr., was a vigorous, incisive debater.  His speeches\r\nwere brief, direct, and disagreeable to his opponents.  He followed Mr.\r\nWebster's advice to the citizens of Boston--he \"made no long orations\"\r\nand in those days, he \"drank no strong potations.\"\r\n\r\nThomas was an energetic, capable man, a ready debater, although of\r\nlimited resources in learning.  Whitmarsh was an unlearned country\r\nleader, whose speeches were better adapted to a neighborhood gathering\r\nof political supporters, than to the deliberations of an assembly\r\ncharged with a share in the government of a state.  Hinckley was an\r\noriginal thinker, with a hobby.  His purpose was to secure the\r\nabolition of the rule which excluded from the witness-stand those who\r\ndid not believe in a personal God.  This he accomplished, and by the\r\naid of the arguments that are formulated in Stuart Mill's Treatise on\r\nLiberty, but they are not there more clearly presented by Mill than\r\nthey had been presented by Hinckley in the debates of 1842 and 1843 in\r\nthe Massachusetts House of Representatives.  Hinckley was a bore, but\r\nthe object was accomplished through his agency.  Since that time such\r\nparties have been permitted to testify, and the day should come\r\nspeedily when the laws should be so changed as to allow the husband\r\nand wife to testify in all cases where they happen to be jointly\r\ninterested or opposed to each other.\r\n\r\nIn judicial investigations, all who know anything should be permitted\r\nto speak, and of their credibility the court and the jury should judge.\r\nNo one should be kept from the witness-stand upon the ground of\r\ninterest or feeling.  Interest in a party or a cause may be a\r\ntemptation to perjury.  In a majority of contests, however, the truth\r\nwill be told voluntarily even by interested or infamous persons, and in\r\ncases where the witness indulges in falsehood the skill of attorneys\r\nand the judgment of the court will enable the jury to reach a correct\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nFrothingham was a student, a fair speaker, but destitute of the\r\nqualities of an orator and too timid for leadership.  A parliamentary\r\nleader may, or may not, be a leader of opinion.  Mr. Clay was both.\r\nMr. Webster was a leader in opinion, and whatever leadership was\r\naccorded to him in the Senate of the United States was due to the\r\nrecognized fact that he represented a constituency of opinion larger\r\nthan his constituency as a senator.  In the case of Mr. Sumner that was\r\nmore conspicuously true.  As a mere parliamentary leader, his standing\r\nwas low.  He was not fertile in resources; he was not ready in debate;\r\nhis arguments rested upon authorities; and these he could not always\r\ncommand in season for the emergency.  But it was admitted that he\r\neither represented a great body of American citizens in opinion, or\r\nthat a great body of American citizens would accept his opinions\r\nwhenever he made them known.\r\n\r\nIn competition with the leaders of the Democratic Party of the\r\nMassachusetts House of Representatives in 1842 it was not a hard task\r\nto acquire a fair standing, but in truth I never thought much of the\r\nresults of my labors as they might affect my standing.\r\n\r\nThe Whig side of the House was at once more able and more numerous.\r\nThe city of Boston was a Whig city by a large majority.  Its members,\r\nabout forty, were chosen on one ticket.  The list was prepared by the\r\ncity committee, and each year some young lawyers, merchants, and\r\ntradesmen, or mechanics, were brought forward.  The vacancies that\r\noccurred enabled the committee to compliment a retired merchant, or\r\nsuccessful mechanic, with a seat in the House.  The attendance of\r\nmembers was not enforced, and it was quite irregular.  A full House\r\nconsisted of about three hundred and fifty members, but sixty was a\r\nquorum.  It was common for merchants and lawyers to call at the House,\r\nlook at the orders of the day, and then go to business.  In an exigency\r\nthey were sent for and brought in to vote.\r\n\r\nThe House was not a place for luxurious ease.  The members sat on long\r\nseats without cushions, having only a narrow shelf on the back of the\r\nseat next in front on which with care a book might be laid or a\r\nmemorandum written.  A drawer under the seat for the documents\r\nconstituted a member's outfit.  There were four wood fires--one in each\r\ncorner of the great hall.  Members sat in their overcoats and hats, and\r\nin one of the rules it was declared that when \"a member rises to speak,\r\nhe shall take off his hat and address the speaker.\"\r\n\r\nBoston sent John C. Gray, John C. Park, Charles Francis Adams, George\r\nT. Bigelow (afterwards Chief Justice of the State), Edmund Dwight,\r\nCharles P. Curtis, George T. Curtis, John G. Palfrey and others who\r\nwere men of mark.\r\n\r\nFrom other parts of the State there were Alvah Crocker, of Fitchburg;\r\nHenry Wilson, of Natick; Thomas Kinnicutt and Benjamin F. Thomas, of\r\nWorcester; John P. Robinson and Daniel S. Richardson, of Lowell;\r\nSamuel H. Walley, Jr., of Roxbury, and others.\r\n\r\nMr. Gray was the son of William Gray, the leading merchant of Boston at\r\nthe close of the last century.  Mr. Gray was kept in the House for many\r\nyears.  He was familiar with the rules and usages, and his influence\r\nwithin certain limits was considerable.  His integrity was undisputed.\r\nNobody suspected him of personal interests in anything.  As chairman of\r\nthe Committee on Finance, he guided the expenditures of the State with\r\neconomy and rigid justice.  As a speaker his powers were limited to a\r\nstatement of the facts bearing upon the case.  To argument in any high\r\nsense he did not aspire.\r\n\r\nJohn C. Park was a good talker.  His resources were at his command.\r\nHis style was agreeable, his argument clear, his positions reasonable,\r\nand yet his influence was extremely limited.  His experience as a\r\nlawyer was the same, substantially.  He was not capable of carrying the\r\nmind of the hearer to conclusions from which there was no escape.\r\n\r\nOf the Whig members, Charles Francis Adams was the one person of most\r\nnote--due to his family and name.  He was then thirty-five years of\r\nage.  He was born into a family of culture, and from the first he\r\nenjoyed every advantage that could be derived from books and from the\r\nconversation of persons of superior intelligence.\r\n\r\nIf we include the earliest period of life, the majority of mankind\r\nacquire a larger share of knowledge from conversation than from\r\nreading or observation.  Mr. Adams had had the best opportunities for\r\ndevelopment and improvement from each and all of the three great\r\nsources of knowledge.  With all these advantages he could not have\r\nbeen included in the first ten on the Whig side of the House.  His\r\nstyle of speaking was at once nervous and oracular.  His voice and\r\nmanner were not agreeable, and he had a peculiar violent jerk of the\r\nhead, as though he would separate it from his body, whenever he became\r\nexcited or bestowed special emphasis upon a remark.  John Quincy Adams\r\nhad the same peculiarity which I had observed in 1839 in his\r\ncontroversy for the right of petition.  In political information Mr.\r\nAdams was the best instructed man in the House.\r\n\r\nIn those days the slavery question in some form was the topic of debate\r\nand of resolves by the two Houses.  Among these the right of petition\r\nand the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia were the most\r\nconspicuous.  In these debates and proceedings Mr. Adams was the\r\nleader.  When he became a member of the Thirty-sixth Congress and was\r\nappointed upon the committee of thirty-three, he accepted a surrender\r\nto the slave power, which would have given to slavery a perpetual lease\r\nof existence, if institutions and constitutions could have preserved\r\nit.  The surrender to slavery, had it been accepted, would have\r\nburdened a race with perpetual servitude and consigned the Republic to\r\nlasting disgrace.  It is to be said, however, that Mr. Adams but\r\nyielded to a public sentiment that was controlling in the city of\r\nWashington in the winter of 1860-61, and which was then formidable in\r\nall parts of the country.  The concession or surrender was accepted by\r\nmany Republicans, including Mr. Corwin of Ohio who was chairman of the\r\ncommittee of thirty-three.\r\n\r\nFrom 1840 to 1850 I was a member of the Legislature for seven years.  A\r\nlarge body of the people led by Robert Rantoul, Jr., William Lloyd\r\nGarrison and Wendell Phillips were in favor of the abolition of capital\r\npunishment.  Many of the clergy, especially of the orthodox clergy,\r\nopposed the change, and for support quoted the laws of Moses.  Sermons\r\nwere preached from the text:  \"Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall\r\nhis blood be shed.\"  If this text is treated as a philosophical\r\nstatement, based upon human nature, that those who resort to blood to\r\navenge their wrongs will get a like return, then the proposition has\r\nwisdom in it; but it is the essence of a bloody code if it mean that\r\neither the State or the individual sufferer should take a human life\r\neither for revenge, punishment, or example.\r\n\r\nAt a session in the Forties the House was made indignant one morning by\r\nthe introduction of a petition by Mr. Tolman, of Worcester, asking that\r\nthe clergy who approved of capital punishment should be appointed\r\nhangman.  A motion was made to reject the petition without reference.\r\nI interposed and called attention to the similarity between the\r\nposition the House was thus taking and the position occupied by the\r\nNational House of Representatives in regard to petitions upon the\r\nsubject of slavery.  The suggestion had no weight with the House.  The\r\npetition was rejected without a reference.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the messenger said Mr. Garrison wished to see me in\r\nthe lobby.  I found Mr. Garrison, Wendell Phillips and William Jackson\r\nwith bundles of petitions of the kind presented by Mr. Tolman.  They\r\nassumed that as I had advocated the reference of the Tolman petition I\r\nwould present others of a like character.  I said, \"Gentlemen, when\r\npetitions are presented by a member upon his personal responsibility I\r\nshall always favor a reference, but as to the presentation of\r\npetitions, I occupy a different position.  I must judge of the wisdom\r\nof the prayer.  In this case I must decline to take any responsibility.\"\r\nThe petitions were presented by Mr. Tolman and the House retreated from\r\nthe awkward position.\r\n\r\nGeorge T. Bigelow was one of the ablest, if not the very ablest, of the\r\nWhig leaders.  His style of speech was plain, direct, and free from\r\npartisan feeling.  His statements were usually within the limits of the\r\nfacts and authorities.  His temper was even and his judgment was free\r\nfrom feeling.  He possessed those qualities which made him an\r\nacceptable judge of the Court of Common Pleas, and afterwards, when he\r\nbecame Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, gave him a conspicuous and\r\nalmost eminent position as jurist.\r\n\r\nGeorge T. Curtis was fastidious, and sometimes he was supercilious, in\r\nhis speeches to the House.  His influence was exceedingly limited, and\r\nhe carried on a constant but useless struggle in the hope of extending\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSamuel H. Walley, Jr., of Roxbury, was for a time, chairman of the\r\nCommittee on Finance, and one whose integrity and competence were never\r\ndoubted by anyone.  The revenues and expenditure of the State were\r\nthen insignificant, relatively, in amount, but the people were poor as\r\ncompared with their condition in 1880 and subsequently.  Every\r\nappropriation was canvassed in every shop and on every farm.  Mr.\r\nWalley maintained a strict economy and the expenses of the State were\r\nkept at the lowest point consistent with the wise administration of\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the Democratic Party, acting in error, attacked the\r\nexpenses, discussed the items in the canvass of 1842, and when they\r\ncame to power in 1843 they made serious reductions, especially in the\r\nmatter of salaries of public officers, and all, as I now think,\r\nunwisely.\r\n\r\nIn the sessions of 1842 and 1843 there came from the town of Woburn,\r\nNathaniel A. Richardson.  When elected he was only twenty-one years of\r\nage.  His election was due to the local fame he had acquired as a\r\nspeaker in the Lyceum of the town.  His career was brief.  Whether he\r\nhad in him the elements of success cannot now be known, but it was\r\nmanifest that he did not get beyond words in his speeches.\r\n\r\nHis speeches were lacking in information and his powers of argument\r\nwere weak and limited.  His most noted speech was in support of a\r\nresolution in favor of refunding to General Jackson the fine of one\r\nthousand dollars that had been imposed upon him by a New Orleans judge.\r\nRichardson's opening sentence was this: \"I rise, Mr. Speaker, and throw\r\nmyself into the crackling embers of this debate,\"--from which, in the\r\njudgment of the House, he never emerged.\r\n\r\nThe Lyceum, as it existed from 1840 to 1850, has disappeared, and to\r\nthe loss of young men who may be called to take part in public affairs.\r\nIn many cases, however, it led to the development of a style of\r\nspeaking that was not adapted to political discussion or to the\r\nprofession of the law.  Speaking and writing should be pursued at the\r\nsame time, and study is an essential condition of success.  In public\r\nassemblies, even in those that are composed of selected persons, there\r\nis always an opportunity for a well-trained man, who is also carefully\r\nand fully informed upon the subject under debate, to exert an influence\r\nand not infrequently he may succeed in securing the acceptance of his\r\nopinions.\r\n\r\nBut study alone will not make a good or even an acceptable speaker,\r\nunless there is added also a period of careful practice.  There are\r\nmany men of learning whose faculty for speaking is so limited that\r\ntheir awkwardness is more conspicuous than their knowledge.  The Lyceum\r\nmay be made a school of practice.  The business should not be limited\r\nto topics that do not excite feeling.  The contests of the world rest\r\nlargely upon feeling, often degenerating into mere passion.  Those\r\nwho are to take part in such contests should learn at an early period\r\nof life to control their feelings and passions.  Such benign results\r\ncan be reached only by experience.  Let the debates of the Lyceum deal\r\nwith questions of living interest, and those who take part in such\r\ncontests will learn to control their feelings and thus prepare\r\nthemselves for the business of life.\r\n\r\nJohn P. Robinson, of Lowell, was the best equipped member of the House\r\nof 1842.  He was then in the prime of life in years, but already\r\nsomewhat impaired.  He was a thoroughly educated man, a trained lawyer,\r\nof considerable experience in country practice--a practice which\r\nrenders the members of the profession more acute than the practice of\r\ncities.  In the country the controversies are about small matters\r\nrelatively, but the clients are deeply interested, the neighborhood\r\nis enlisted on one side or the other, and the attendance at court of\r\nthe friends of the parties is often large.  The counsel is tried quite\r\nas rigorously and critically as is the case.  Such was the condition of\r\nthings previous to 1848.  Robinson was not only a good English scholar,\r\nbut he was devoted to the classics, and especially to the Greek\r\nclassics and history.  Afterwards he became a resident of Athens where\r\nhe lived for several years.  He was a good speaker in a high sense of\r\nthe phrase.  In the sessions of 1842 and 1843 the system of\r\ncorporations was in controversy.  The Democrats were in opposition\r\ngenerally.  The Whig Party favored the system.  In the session of 1842\r\nor 1843 citizens of Nantucket presented a petition for an Act of\r\nIncorporation as a \"Camel Company.\"  The town had been the chief port\r\nin the world for the whale-fishery business.  Its insular position\r\nrendered it necessary to obtain supplies from the mainland and to\r\ntransport the products of the fishery to the mainland.  The fact that\r\nthere was a bar across the harbor, which made it impossible to bring in\r\nvessels of the size of those engaged in the fishery was fast depriving\r\nit of its supremacy.  New London was already a rival.\r\n\r\nThe scheme for relief was to build what was called \"camels.\"  They were\r\nvessels capable of receiving a whale-ship and floating it over the bar.\r\nThey were to be made broad, of shallow draught, with air-tight\r\ncompartments.  These machines were to be taken outside the bar; the\r\ncompartments were to be filled with water and the camels sunk.  The\r\nwhale ship was then to be floated over the camel and the water was then\r\nto be pumped out of the compartments when the camel would rise with the\r\nship on its back and carry the whaler into the harbor.\r\n\r\nThe scheme seemed a wild one, but opinions were controlled by party\r\nfeeling.  The bill passed, the camels were built, and the scheme failed\r\nas a practical measure.  Nantucket was doomed as a trading and\r\ncommercial town.  As a watering place it had a future.  In one of the\r\ndebates upon corporations Robinson took part, perhaps upon the\r\nNantucket \"camel\" question, and made the best speech to which I have\r\never listened in defense of the system.\r\n\r\nThe corporation system has yielded larger returns to Massachusetts\r\nthan she has received from any other feature of her domestic policy,\r\nexcepting only her system of public instruction.\r\n\r\nRobinson lived, probably, on the verge of insanity, to which end he\r\ncame finally.  When a member of the House, he was restless, almost\r\nconstantly walking in the area or through the aisles, running his\r\nhands through his long black hair, engaged apparently in meditation\r\nupon topics outside of the business of the House.\r\n\r\nHe is immortalized in Lowell's \"Biglow Papers,\"\r\n\r\n  \"John P. Robinson, he\r\n   Says he won't vote for Governor B.\"\r\n\r\nThe Governor B. was Governor George N. Briggs, with whom Robinson had\r\na quarrel about the year 1845.\r\n\r\nHenry Wilson, afterwards Senator and Vice-President of the United\r\nStates, was a member of the House in 1842 and 1843.  He had risen to\r\nnotice in the campaign of 1840.  He was engaged by the Whig Party as\r\none of its speakers and announced as the \"Natick Cobbler.\"\r\n\r\nHe had worked in the trade of a shoemaker, and as the shoe interest was\r\nalready a large interest in the State, it was a matter of no slight\r\nimportance to give distinction to a representative of the craft.\r\nWilson's family were destitute of culture, and although he had had the\r\nadvantage of training at an academy for a year, perhaps, his\r\nattainments were very limited.  I recollect papers in his handwriting\r\nin which the rule requiring a sentence to commence with a capital\r\nletter was disregarded uniformly.  His style of speaking was heavy and\r\nunattractive.  This peculiarity remained to the end.  In those days\r\nWilson was known as an Anti-Slavery Whig.  In some respects Wilson's\r\npolitical career was tortuous, but in all his windings he was true to\r\nthe cause of human liberty.\r\n\r\nAlthough I was acquainted with Wilson from 1842 to the time of his\r\ndeath, I could never so analyze the man as to understand the elements\r\nof the power which he possessed.  It may have rested in the\r\ncircumstance that he appeared to be important, if not essential, to\r\nevery party with which he was identified.  His acquaintance was\r\nextensive and it included classes of men with whom many persons in\r\npublic life do not associate.  He made the acquaintance of all the\r\nreporters and editors and publishers of papers wherever he went.  He\r\nfrequented saloons and restaurants to ascertain public sentiment.  In\r\npolitical campaigns he was the prophet, foretelling results with\r\nunusual accuracy.\r\n\r\nBenjamin F. Thomas of Worcester was a leading man in the Whig Party, a\r\ngood speaker, saving only that he appeared to vociferate.  He was\r\nafterwards a judge of the Supreme Court of the State and for a single\r\nterm he was a member of Congress.\r\n\r\nAs a lawyer his rank was good, almost eminent, in the State, but his\r\ncareer in Congress was a failure.  He was a member of the Thirty-\r\nseventh Congress, and he failed to realize the issues and to comprehend\r\nthe duties of a public man in an hour of peril.  In 1862 he abandoned\r\nthe Republican Party, and joined himself to a temporary organization in\r\nthe State, called the People's Party.\r\n\r\nThe party disappeared upon its defeat in November, 1862, and Judge\r\nThomas disappeared from politics.\r\n\r\nMr. Kinnicutt, the Speaker, in 1842, was a gentleman of agreeable\r\nmanners, fair presence, and respectable, moderate abilities.  He\r\nadministered the office with entire fairness.  His elevation to the\r\npost of Speaker, then thought to be one of great importance, may have\r\nbeen due to his residence at Worcester.  In those days, as in these,\r\nWorcester was a center of political power and its leading men were able\r\nalways to command consideration.  When, in 1840, it was an urgency in\r\nparty politics to defeat Governor Morton, John Davis, of Worcester,\r\ncalled \"Honest John,\" was selected as the candidate, although he was\r\nthen a member of the United States Senate.\r\n\r\nIn the sessions of 1843 and 1844, I originated three measures and\r\nintroduced bills designed to give legal form to the measures.\r\n\r\n1.  A bill requiring cashiers of banks and treasurers of all other\r\ncorporations to return to the assessors of each city and town the names\r\nof stockholders residing in each such city or town, the shares held by\r\neach and the par value of the shares.  The bill was passed.  The\r\nholders of stock who had theretofore escaped taxation were enraged, and\r\na meeting to denounce the measure was held in Boston.\r\n\r\n2.  A bill to require the mortgagee to pay the tax on mortgaged real\r\nestate.  The bill was then defeated, but recently the measure has\r\nbecome a law.\r\n\r\n3.  The reduction of the poll tax.\r\n\r\nOn each of the last two measures I made a speech which was reported in\r\nthe Boston _Post_.  Upon the revival of the question concerning the\r\ntaxation of mortgaged real estate, my opinions were not as firmly in\r\nits favor as they had been in 1843, when I originated and advocated the\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\nThe assessment of a poll-tax as a prerequisite to the exercise of the\r\nright to vote is a relic of the property qualification and it ought not\r\nany longer to find a place in the policy of free States.  As persons\r\nwithout accumulated property enjoy the benefits of free schools, the\r\nuse of roads and bridges, and the protection of the laws, there is a\r\njustification for the assessment of a capitation tax, but the right to\r\nvote should not be dependent upon its payment.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\nTHE ELECTION OF 1842, AND THE DORR REBELLION\r\n\r\nThe election of 1842 was contested by the Democratic Party and\r\nsuccessfully, upon the charge that the Whig Administration had unwisely\r\nand illegally aided the \"law and order party\" in Rhode Island in the\r\ncontroversy with Thomas W. Dorr, the leader of the party engaged in an\r\nattempt to change the form of government in that State.  At that time\r\nthe people of Rhode Island were living under the charter granted by\r\nCharles II.  Its provisions were illiberal in the opinion of the\r\nmajority of the people of Rhode Island, but the majority of the voters\r\nunder the Charter thought otherwise.  Mr. Dorr represented the popular\r\nopinion, and Governor King represented the dominant class.  Governor\r\nKing was a Whig and, naturally the Whig Party of Massachusetts\r\nsympathized with him.  Gen. H. A. S. Dearborn, who had been an officer\r\nin the War of 1812, was then Adjutant-General of Massachusetts.  In his\r\nhaste to aid Governor King, he loaned to him quite a quantity of\r\nmuskets from the State Arsenal.  This act caused great criticism and\r\ncontributed to the overthrow of the Whig Party in 1842, if it did not\r\nin fact cause it.  Dorr had organized a government, under a\r\nconstitution which had been ratified by such of the people of Rhode\r\nIsland as chose to vote upon it.  The Dorr legislature assembled, a\r\nmilitary force was organized, and the State seemed to be on the eve of\r\na bloody contest.\r\n\r\nGovernor King appealed for aid to President Tyler.  The President\r\nrecognized Governor King as the head of the lawful government of the\r\nState, and although the aid was not granted, the Dorr Rebellion came\r\nto an end.  The courts followed the political department of the\r\ngovernment, and the attempt of Dorr and his associates was a failure in\r\nfact and in law.  The failure was followed, however, by the adoption of\r\na constitution from which the most objectionable features of the\r\nCharter were removed.\r\n\r\nIn 1842 Massachusetts was living under the majority system.  The\r\nAbolitionists placed a candidate in nomination.  As a consequence there\r\nwas no election of Governor by the people.  The Democrats succeeded in\r\nobtaining a majority of the Senators elected.  The House was about\r\nequally divided between the Whigs and the Democrats, and the balance of\r\npower was in the hands of four Abolitionists, who were led by one Lewis\r\nWilliams of Easton.  Williams was a sort of personage for ten or\r\ntwelve days, when he disappeared from public view.\r\n\r\nIn the contest for Speaker the Democrats supported Seth J. Thomas, of\r\nCharlestown, and the Whigs nominated Thomas Kinnicutt, of Worcester,\r\nwho had held the office of Speaker in 1842.  The Abolitionists voted\r\nfor Williams.  The struggle continued for two days without a result.\r\nOn the third day Mr. Kinnicutt withdrew his name, and his friends\r\npresented the name of Daniel P. King, of Danvers.\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas made a short speech in which he said that he was in the\r\nhands of his friends.  The Democrats attempted to change front, and\r\nto secure the election of Williams.  The attempt failed, and Mr. King\r\nwas elected.  Mr. King was a man of moderate abilities, but he had made\r\nhimself acceptable to the voting element of the Anti-Slavery Party.\r\nHis election as Speaker, was followed by his election to the Twenty-\r\neighth Congress.  The southern part of Essex County had been\r\nrepresented by Leverett Saltonstall, of Salem.  He was the candidate of\r\nthe Whig Party in 1842, but the votes of the Anti-Slavery men prevented\r\nhis election.  Mr. Saltonstall was a man of superior abilities and a\r\nperfect gentleman in bearing and conduct.  He had been a Federalist\r\nand my impressions were adverse to him.  In 1844 he came to the\r\nMassachusetts House of Representatives.  He was appointed Chairman of\r\nthe Judiciary Committee of which I was a member.  All my prejudices\r\nwere removed, and I came to admire his qualities as a man, and his\r\ncapacity as a legislator.\r\n\r\nUpon the organization of the House of Representatives, in 1843, the\r\ntwo Houses in convention, proceeded to the election of a Governor,\r\nLieutenant Governor, Council, and heads of the several administrative\r\nbureaus.  Marcus Morton, of Taunton, was elected Governor, Dr. Childs\r\nof Pittsfield (Henry H.) was chosen Lieutenant Governor, and of the\r\nsubordinate officers all were Democrats.\r\n\r\nThe nomination of John A. Bolles, for the office of Secretary of the\r\nCommonwealth, gave rise to a singular episode in politics.  John P.\r\nBigelow, of Boston, had held that office for several years.  He had\r\nperformed the duties acceptably, and there was a difference of opinion\r\nin the Democratic Party as to the expediency of a change.  The caucus\r\ndecided to make a change.  Upon the announcement of the nomination of\r\nMr. Bolles, Nathaniel Wood, who had been elected a Senator in\r\nconvention, from the county of Worcester, left the caucus and the next\r\nday he resigned his seat in the Senate.  His peculiarities did not end\r\nwith this act.  In 1850 he was elected to the House for the year 1851,\r\nas a Coalition Democrat.  He voted for Sumner, but he was greatly\r\nannoyed by the charge of the Whigs that there had been an unholy\r\ncoalition between a portion of the Democratic Party and the Free-\r\nsoilers.  In replying to the allegations, he made the counter charge\r\nthat there was a coalition between the Whigs and the \"old hunker\r\nDemocrats\" as they were called.  They were, in fact, the Democrats\r\nwho would not vote for Sumner.  A member called upon Wood for the\r\nevidence.  This question he had not anticipated, and after staggering\r\nfor a reply, he said--\"I have seen them whispering together.\"  As legal\r\nevidence the answer was faulty, but in a moral point of view it was not\r\nwithout force.\r\n\r\nGovernor Morton was a man of solid qualities.  He had been upon the\r\nbench of the Supreme Judicial Court of the State for many years and in\r\nthe fellowship of such jurists as Chief Justice Shaw, Judges Wilde,\r\nPutnam, Hubbard, and others, and he had borne himself with credit and\r\nperhaps even with distinction.  He was a favorite of the Democratic\r\nParty and for many years he had been its candidate for Governor, and\r\nalways without opposition.  His election in 1839 was due to the public\r\ndissatisfaction with the Temperance Act passed in 1838 and known as the\r\nFifteen-Gallon Law.  He became Governor in the year 1840, but as his\r\nCouncil and the two Houses were controlled by the Whig Party neither\r\nhis friends nor his enemies had any means of testing his quality as a\r\npolitical administrator.  In 1843, however, the circumstances were\r\ndifferent.  His political friends were in power in every branch of the\r\ngovernment.  Party expectations were not realized, and Governor\r\nMorton's administration was not popular with the party generally.\r\nEarly in the session, Benjamin F. Hallett, a member of the Executive\r\nCouncil, became alienated, and the spirit of harmony was banished from\r\nthat branch of the government.\r\n\r\nAs the election had been carried upon the Dorr Rebellion, it was\r\nthought expedient to recognize the event by a dinner in Faneuil Hall.\r\nDorr was then an exile, and the guest of Henry Hubbard, Democratic\r\nGovernor of New Hampshire.  Dorr was invited to the dinner, but he did\r\nnot attend.  It was asserted that he was given to understand that\r\nGovernor Morton would by placed in an unpleasant position if Dorr were\r\nto come to Massachusetts from New Hampshire, and at the same time, a\r\nrequisition should come from the Governor of Rhode Island for his\r\ndelivery to answer in that State to an indictment for treason.  The\r\nincident gave rise to a good deal of feeling, and finally, Governor\r\nMorton did not attend the banquet.  Thus it happened that neither of\r\nthe chiefs in whose honor the banquet was arranged, was in attendance\r\non the occasion.\r\n\r\nI was appointed Chairman of the Committee on Invitations.  These were\r\nsent to leading Democrats in all parts of the country and especially\r\nwere they sent to distinguished members of Congress.  The answers\r\ncontained only the most delicate and remote allusions to the object\r\nof the festival.  The letters were turned over to the officers of the\r\nmeeting.  For myself, I retained only the envelope of the letter of Mr.\r\nCalhoun with his frank upon the right-hand corner.  I had not\r\npreviously seen a letter envelope.\r\n\r\nGovernor Morton's administration was a failure, and at the election in\r\n1843 he was defeated by Governor Briggs.  The State was a Whig State,\r\nand a Democratic administration for two successive years was an\r\nimpossibility.  My impressions of Governor Morton underwent several\r\nchanges.  Previous to his election in 1843 I had regarded him as one\r\nof the able men of the country.  His lack of courage, and his apparent\r\ndesertion of his friends in 1843 produced an unfavorable impression\r\nupon me both of his character and of his abilities.  As to his\r\ncharacter, my impressions remain.  Of his abilities I can have no doubt.\r\n\r\nWith some exceptions the policy and measures of the Democratic Party\r\nin 1843 were crude and unwise.  They demanded changes under the name\r\nof reforms.  The chief measure was a bill to reduce the salaries of\r\npublic officers, including the salaries of the governor, the lieutenant\r\ngovernor, and the judges of all the courts.  The Whigs resisted the\r\npassage of the bill, upon the ground of its injustice to the persons in\r\noffice, and of its unconstitutionality in respect to the salaries of\r\nthe judges of the Supreme Judicial Court.\r\n\r\nThe bill became a law, and upon the return of the Whigs to power in\r\n1844, the salaries of the judges of the Supreme Judicial Court were\r\nrestored, and they were reimbursed for the loss sustained by the act\r\nof 1843.  At the session of 1844 I made an argument upon the\r\nconstitutional question, but it was of no avail.  As I have not read\r\nmy own argument since 1844 I am not prepared to say that it is\r\nunsound.\r\n\r\nBy the election of 1843 Governor Morton was defeated.  George N. Briggs\r\nwho had been for many years a member of Congress from the Berkshire\r\nDistrict, was elected Governor, and with him a majority of his\r\npolitical friends in the two Houses.  Governor Briggs held the office\r\nuntil January 1851.  He was a man of fair, natural abilities, with a\r\ntaste for politics.  He had risen from a low condition of life but he\r\nwas entirely free from the vices of the world.  As a rigid temperance\r\nman and opponent to slavery, the middle classes of the State became\r\nhis supporters without argument.  He held the office for seven years,\r\nbut he was defeated by the coalition of 1850.\r\n\r\nAmong the leading members of the House in 1844, was Joseph Bell, then\r\nrecently from Hanover, N. H.  He was named second on the Judiciary\r\nCommittee, and to him was committed the conduct of the bill to restore\r\nthe judges' salaries.  He was a man of massive frame and of great vigor\r\nof body.  His voice was loud, but it lacked those elements that come\r\nfrom cultivation.  He had accumulated considerable wealth in the\r\ncountry and he had come to Boston for ease and comfort in age.  His\r\ncareer was brief as he lived only a few years thereafter.\r\n\r\nOf the affirmative measures of the Legislature of 1844 the most\r\nimportant perhaps was the statute requiring the registration of births,\r\nmarriages, and deaths.  Previous to that time there was no\r\nauthoritative records of births, marriages, or deaths.  The books of\r\ntown clerks, the records of clergymen, and the entries in family Bibles\r\nwere the sources of information.  The information was never complete,\r\nand often that obtained was inaccurate.  The promoters of the measure\r\nwere Dr. Edward Jarvis of Dorchester and Lemuel Shattuck of Concord.\r\nThey were both enthusiastic upon the subject and when they had created\r\nin me an interest, they furnished me with books and documents including\r\nreports of the English and French systems.  The petition or memorial\r\nwas referred to the Judiciary Committee and it fell to me to prepare\r\nthe bill.  This I did with the aid, and largely under the direction, of\r\nShattuck and Jarvis.  Then for the first time I had practical use for\r\nthe small stock of knowledge that I had acquired of the French\r\nlanguage.  Previous to my election to the Legislature I had purchased a\r\nseries of books on the French language, known as \"French Without a\r\nTeacher.\"  My study of the language had been limited to fragments of\r\ntime that I could command while engaged in the business of the store.\r\nUpon my election to the Legislature I made the acquaintance of Count\r\nLa Porte who had been a professor of the French language at Cambridge.\r\nI took lessons from him during the sessions of 1842 and 1843.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1844 I received from the Democratic Party the nomination\r\nfor a seat in Congress.  It was a barren honor.  The district was in\r\nthe hands of the Whig Party by a respectable majority.  In the canvass\r\nof 1842 the Whigs had nominated John P. Robinson.  He was not an\r\nacceptable candidate, and the candidate of the Abolitionists received\r\na large vote.  The Democratic candidate was Joseph W. Mansur of\r\nLowell.  In the first contest he was near an election by a majority.\r\nAt the second trial his friends had high hopes of success.  At the\r\nclose of the contest it was found that he had lost votes.  His\r\nfriends charged that his loss was due to the secret opposition of\r\nJosiah G. Abbott, who was a rival to Mansur, in the city of Lowell.\r\nIn 1844 Mansur retired from the field and Abbott became a candidate.\r\nMansur's friends were opposed to the nomination of Abbott, and by their\r\naction the nomination came to me.  The district was then hopeless.  In\r\n1842 the Dorr question was uppermost in the public mind.  That had lost\r\nits power.  In a Presidential contest Massachusetts was Whig by an\r\nimmense majority.  National questions were all-controlling.  I was\r\nrenominated for Congress in 1846 and 1848.  I canvassed the district\r\nand made speeches in the principal places but as to success I never\r\nhad any hope.\r\n\r\nThe 17th day of June, 1843, Mr. Webster delivered the address upon the\r\ncompletion of the Bunker Hill Monument.  President Tyler and some\r\nmembers of his Cabinet were present.  The concourse of people was so\r\ngreat that experts were justified in estimating the number at one\r\nhundred thousand.  This was the third opportunity that I had had to\r\nhear Mr. Webster speak.  The first was in the Senate in January, 1839.\r\nA few days later I was present in the gallery of the Supreme Court\r\nroom, and heard the argument in the case of Smith _v._ Richards.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster appeared for Smith and Mr. Crittenden for Richards.  The\r\nsubject was the sale of a gold mine in which fraud was alleged by\r\nSmith.  The judgment was for Richards, three judges dissenting.  For\r\nthe first time I heard the word \"denizen,\" used by Mr. Crittenden.\r\n\r\nThe election of 1844 was disastrous to the Democratic Party of\r\nMassachusetts.  George Bancroft was its candidate for Governor.  He was\r\nan enthusiastic leader, but not a popular candidate.  I recall the\r\ncircumstance that I met him during the canvass at the head of Hanover\r\nStreet, Boston, when some news favorable to Polk had been received.  He\r\nhad a small cane in his hand which he whirled in the air, and shouted:\r\n\"Glorious!  Glorious!\" until we were surrounded by a crowd of men and\r\nboys.\r\n\r\nAt the November election I was defeated by a majority of seventy-six, I\r\nthink, in a vote of about four hundred.  I had some political sins of\r\nmy own that intensified the hostility of my Whig neighbors, and many\r\nDemocrats voted the Whig ticket.\r\n\r\nThe act requiring the treasurers and cashiers of corporations to return\r\nthe names of stockholders to the assessors of the cities and towns\r\nwhere the stockholders resided with the amount of stock held by each,\r\ncould not be overlooked by those who had suffered.  The recollection of\r\nmy part in the business was still fresh in the minds of the victims.\r\nNext the scheme for the annexation of Texas was treated as a Democratic\r\nmeasure, and every Democrat suffered for the sin of the party.  As to\r\nmyself, I had spoken in the House against the scheme.  I was a member\r\nof the Committee, of which Charles F. Adams was Chairman, that had made\r\nreports adverse to the measure.  The circumstances, however, availed\r\nnothing.  Mr. Clay's popularity was great, notwithstanding the\r\nindifference or concealed hostility of Mr. Webster.  Indeed, Mr.\r\nWebster's popularity had suffered from his connection with John Tyler.\r\n\r\nMr. Polk had no strength in Massachusetts.  He was the nominee of the\r\nDemocratic Party, nothing more.  Before the day of election came in\r\nMassachusetts the election of Polk was known and conceded.  New York\r\nvoted the Monday preceding the Monday of the election in Massachusetts,\r\nand the voting was not over until Wednesday night.  There was a mass\r\nmeeting at Pepperell, Thursday afternoon, at which Benjamin F. Hallett\r\nand myself spoke.  Mr. Hallett was very confident of Polk's election.\r\nI was in doubt.\r\n\r\nThat evening I spoke at Chelmsford, and upon my return to Groton, I\r\nfound several Whigs at Hoar's tavern, who were congratulating\r\nthemselves upon a Whig victory in New York.  Their authority was the\r\nBoston _Atlas,_ an authority not universally accepted at that time.  As\r\nI passed through the bar-room, after leaving my horse at the stable, I\r\nwas rallied, and the assertion was made with great confidence that Mr.\r\nClay was elected.  I could only say in reply that they had better wait\r\nuntil they had some other authority for the claim.  I went to my house,\r\nhowever, with many doubts as to the success of Polk.\r\n\r\nAt that time there was no railway communication between Boston and\r\nGroton.  The first intelligence from abroad came from Lowell.  My\r\nfriends there sent to me a copy of the _Vox Populi,_ printed during the\r\nnight, and which contained the truthful returns from New York.  At that\r\ntime the _Vox Populi_ was not in very good repute, and I thought it\r\nunwise to quote it to anyone.  I thrust it into my desk without\r\nmentioning its contents.\r\n\r\nUpon the arrival of the stage from Boston, I received a bundle of\r\npapers from my old friend General Staples, which confirmed the news\r\nfurnished by the _Vox Populi_.  These papers I also thrust into my\r\ndesk, and went to the post-office.  The outer room was filled with\r\nWhigs--not one Democrat present.  The Whigs were still reposing upon\r\nthe news printed in the Boston _Atlas,_ but my statement that I had\r\ninformation more recent and that Polk had carried New York disturbed\r\ntheir composure.\r\n\r\nAt length the postmaster, Caleb Butler, opened the slide door, and\r\npassed out a copy of the Boston _Courier_.  The receiver opened it.\r\nThere were no capitals, no signs of exultation, and without waiting\r\nfor the reading of the text, the assembly accepted the fact that Clay\r\nwas defeated.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs of Massachusetts and indeed of the whole country were deeply\r\ngrieved by the defeat of Mr. Clay.  In many instances his popularity\r\nhad ripened into personal friendship.  His defeat came to many families\r\nas a real loss.  Among the disappointed Whigs who had met at the post-\r\noffice that morning was a neighbor and friend of mine, Mr. Aaron\r\nPerkins.  In his excitement he said with an oath, \"Next Monday we will\r\ngive you a whipping.\"  His declaration was verified.  Many Democrats\r\nwhose names were never disclosed to me voted for the Whig candidate,\r\nDeacon William Livermore, and he was elected by a majority of more than\r\nseventy votes.  The next year he was re-elected by a diminished\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\nIn 1846 the Whig Party nominated a new candidate, Edwin Coburn, a young\r\nlawyer then in the office of George F. Farley, with whom Coburn had\r\nstudied his profession.  Coburn was a man of good parts intellectually,\r\na fair debater, and an intimate friend of mine.  The town was canvassed\r\nthoroughly.  Two ballots were taken during the first day.  I received\r\none hundred and ninety-six votes, and Coburn received one hundred and\r\nninety-six votes at each ballot, and there were four scattering votes.\r\nThe meeting was adjourned to the succeeding day.  That night there was\r\na rally of the absentees.  The Democrats sent to Lowell, Manchester,\r\nN. H., and Boston, there being an absentee at each of those places.\r\nUpon the first ballot the second day I received two hundred and eleven\r\nvotes and Coburn two hundred and seven.  Of scattering votes there were\r\nnone.  From that time forward the town was Democratic.  In all the\r\nprevious contests I had contended against a Whig majority.  My success\r\nhad been due to the friendship of a number of Whig families, to my\r\nstrength among the young men, and to a more perfect organization of the\r\nDemocratic Party.  The annexation of Texas, and the Mexican War, had\r\nalienated the support of some, and to this fact was due the closeness\r\nof the contest of 1846.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\nTHE LEGISLATURE OF 1847\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of the Legislature of 1847, some new members appeared.\r\nCaleb Cushing came from Newburyport, and Fletcher Webster, and J.\r\nLothrop Motley from Boston.  The Democrats of Boston and vicinity were\r\nthen engaged in raising and equipping a regiment for Mexico.  Cushing\r\nwas Colonel of the regiment and Edward Webster, a brother of Fletcher,\r\nwas the Captain of one of the companies.  On the first day of the\r\nsession Cushing introduced an order to appropriate twenty thousand\r\ndollars to aid in equipping the regiment for service.  The order was\r\nreferred to a special committee of which Cushing was made chairman.\r\nI was put upon the committee and the majority were friends of the\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\nUpon the report a discussion sprang up which was partisan with a few\r\nexceptions.  Conspicuous among the exceptions was Fletcher Webster.\r\nWebster supported the appropriation in a speech of signal ability.  His\r\ndrawback was the disposition to compare him with his father.  Fletcher\r\nwas aware of this, and I recollect his remarks upon the subject at an\r\naccidental meeting on Warren Bridge.  Fletcher was rather undersize,\r\nand he spoke of that fact as a hindrance to success in life, in\r\naddition to the disposition to compare him with his father.  In his\r\nspeech he made a remark not unlike the style of his father.  Addressing\r\nhimself to his Whig friends, he said that they would be required to\r\nexplain their opposition to the measure, and added, \"and explanations\r\nare always disagreeable.\"  My acquaintance with Fletcher Webster, was\r\nthe introduction to a limited acquaintance with his father, and it led\r\nto an act on the part of Mr. Webster which was of signal importance to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nMr. Cushing remained in the House until the loss of the appropriation,\r\nwhen he left for Washington.  President Polk gave him a commission as a\r\nBrigadier-General, and he left for Mexico.\r\n\r\nMotley was chairman of the Committee on Education, and as Chairman he\r\nreported a bill to divide a portion of the proceeds of the Maine lands,\r\namong the three colleges of the State.  Theretofore they had been added\r\nto the Common School Fund.  As a member of the committee, I opposed the\r\nmeasure, and the bill was lost.  The subject is mentioned in Holmes'\r\nLife of Motley, and a letter of mine is printed therein.  I had no idea\r\nat the time that Motley had any feeling on account of his defeat, but\r\nMr. Hooper informed me that it led him to abandon politics.  If so I\r\nmay have been the unconscious cause of a success in literature which he\r\nmight not have attained in public, political life.\r\n\r\nAt this session I inaugurated a movement for the reorganization of\r\nHarvard College.  The contest was continued in 1848, '49 and '50.  In\r\n1851 I was elected Governor and the Legislature, under the lead of\r\nCaleb Cushing, passed a bill by which the overseers of the College were\r\nmade elective by the Legislature.  It was a compromise measure, and its\r\nimmediate results were not favorable to the College.  The lobby became\r\ninfluential in the selection of overseers and unemployed clergymen of\r\nvarious denominations were active in lobbying for themselves.  After\r\na few years' experience the election of overseers was transferred to\r\nthe Alumni, with whom the power still remains.  The bill which I\r\nintroduced, the reports and arguments which I submitted to the House,\r\naimed at the reorganization of the corporation and the election of the\r\ncorporators by the Legislature.\r\n\r\nIn the years 1849 and 1850 the town of Concord was represented by the\r\nHon. Samuel Hoar, and he led in the defence of the College.  He was no\r\nordinary antagonist.  First and last I have been brought into\r\ncompetition with many men of ability, and I have not often met a more\r\nable reasoner.  He spoke without notes, his only aid being his pocket\r\nknife which he held in his right hand and dropped by regular processes\r\ninto his left hand, where he changed the ends of the knife and then\r\nresumed the automatic process.\r\n\r\nMy own argument I have not read for many years, but it is not unlikely\r\nthat it contains as much ingenuity as can be found in any argument that\r\nI have ever made.  The movement attracted a good deal of interest in\r\nthe State.  The College was in control of the Unitarians exclusively,\r\nand it was far from prosperous.  The final change of the Board of\r\nOverseers gave a popular character to the institution, and it was one\r\nof the elements of its recent prosperity.  For the moment the managers\r\nof the College were very hostile to me, but in the course of ten years\r\nall feeling had disappeared, and I enjoyed the friendship of Presidents\r\nSparks, Felton, and Walker.\r\n\r\nThe College conferred upon me the degree of LL.D. in 1851.  That honor\r\nhad no significance as it was given to every person who was elected\r\nGovernor and that without regard to his learning, attainments, or\r\nservices.*  Subsequently, however, I was elected a member of the\r\nAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences by the votes of those who were\r\ncontrolling the College.  In 1861 I was invited to deliver the Phi\r\nBeta Kappa oration, and I was then made a member of the society.  Since\r\nthe opening of the war I have been at Cambridge on two or three\r\noccasions only, and my present acquaintance with the persons in power\r\nis very limited.\r\n\r\nFrom 1844 to 1850 I received from Governor Briggs several appointments.\r\nIn 1845 or '46 the Legislature passed an Act authorizing the\r\nappointment of railway commissioners.  Governor Briggs sent me a\r\ncommission, which I declined.  The Board was never organized, and the\r\nact was soon repealed.  I was also appointed a member of a commission\r\non Boston Harbor.  At the time the public were anxious about the fate\r\nof the harbor in consequence of the drainage into it by Charles River,\r\nand numerous minor channels.  It was not then understood that all\r\ndeposits by drainage could be removed by dredging.  The members of the\r\nCommission were Judges Williams, Hopkinson, Cummins, the Hon. Chas.\r\nHudson and myself.  The three judges had then recently lost their\r\noffices by the abolition of the court of common pleas.  Mr. Hudson\r\nhad then recently left the United States House of Representatives, but\r\nwhether voluntarily or upon compulsion I cannot say.  He was a\r\nclergyman, a Universalist, but at an early age he had abandoned his\r\nprofession for politics.  After serving in the Massachusetts House,\r\nSenate and Council, he was elected to Congress from the Worcester\r\ndistrict, for which he sat during four Congresses.  He was a man of\r\nsolid qualities without genius of any sort.  He was distinguished in\r\nCongress as a Protectionist, and his speeches on the tariff question\r\nwere widely circulated by the Whig Party.  They were filled with\r\nstatistics, and like all arguments based on statistics, they were\r\nsubject to a good deal of criticism by the advocates of free trade.\r\n\r\nThe three judges were respectable, clear-headed gentlemen.  Of Cummins\r\nthe story is told that, when for the first time a plan of land was\r\nintroduced in a real-estate case, he refused to consider the document,\r\nsaying:  \"I will not allow a case to be won in my court by diagrams.\"\r\nWilliams had been chief justice of the common pleas court and he was\r\nestimated as the superior among his associates upon the bench.  Judge\r\nHopkinson was from Lowell, where he had been a favorite of the ruling\r\nclass in that city.  He was a man of moderate ability.  The work of the\r\ncommission continued through several months, and some of its\r\nrecommendations were adopted by the Legislature.\r\n\r\nAs the charters of all the banks in the State were to expire in 1850 or\r\n1851, in the latter year, I think, the Legislature authorized the\r\nappointment of a board of commissioners for the examination of the\r\nbanks.  The Governor and Council appointed Solomon Lincoln, of Hingham,\r\nJoseph S. Cabot of Salem, and myself.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln was a kind, capable man of considerable learning,\r\nespecially in Old Colony history and genealogy.  His first question to\r\nbank officers often related to them personally, and when he found a man\r\nwho traced his line to the Old Colony, he pressed him with questions\r\nuntil his whole history was disclosed.  Mr. Cabot sometimes anticipated\r\nMr. Lincoln, by saying at once, when we entered a bank, \"Is there\r\nanybody here from the Old Colony?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Cabot was a bachelor of fifty, and his ways were often odd, and\r\noccasionally they were disagreeable.  He had a custom of never locking\r\nhis sleeping-room door.  Of this he often boasted.  When we were at the\r\nAmerican House, Worcester, Mr. Cabot said upon his appearance in the\r\nmorning:  \"A very queer thing happened to me last night.  When I got up\r\nmy clothes were missing.  At last I opened the door, and there they\r\nwere in the hall.  I supposed that I had been robbed.  But I am all\r\nright,\" taking his wallet from his pocket.  I said:  \"Have you looked\r\nin your wallet?\"  He opened it to find that the money had disappeared.\r\nWe ventured to suggest that for a bank commissioner, he had not shown\r\na great amount of shrewdness.\r\n\r\nIn the years 1849 and 1850 the commission examined all the banks in the\r\nState.  Only one was found insolvent, a bank at Pawtucket on the\r\nRhode Island line.  The cashier, named Tillinghast, had been persuaded\r\nby a man named Marchant, of Rhode Island, to loan money without the\r\nknowledge of the officers of the bank.  The loan, at the time of the\r\ndiscovery, amounted to sixty thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nUpon the examination it appeared that there was a slight surplus of\r\nfunds over the amount required by the statement.  We insisted upon\r\nanother examination.  The cashier then reduced the balance by the\r\nstatement that certain notes sent forward for collection had been\r\ndiscounted.  It was impossible, however, to make the two sides of the\r\naccount equal each other.  At the end of the second day the cashier\r\nconfessed the crime, and transferred his private property to the bank.\r\nMarchant did nothing.  He came to the Rhode Island edge of the bridge,\r\nwhere we had some consultations with him, but without any result\r\nadvantageous to the bank.\r\n\r\nIn 1847 I was a member of a joint committee to investigate the subject\r\nof insanity in the State, and to visit asylums in other States, the\r\nobject being the erection of a second hospital for the care and\r\ntreatment of the insane.  At the time the only asylum under the control\r\nof the State was that at Worcester.  There was a second at Somerville\r\nfor the treatment of private patients.  This was under the control of\r\nthe Massachusetts General Hospital.  The hospital at Worcester was\r\nunder the management of Dr. Woodward, and each years for many years the\r\nreports had set it forth as a well organized and well managed\r\ninstitution.  At the beginning of our labors we visited the Worcester\r\nHospital.  I was then ignorant of the treatment of the insane, but I\r\nwas shocked by the sight of women in the cells in the basement, who had\r\nno bedding but straw, and some of whom had no clothing whatever.\r\n\r\nThe committee visited the McLean Asylum at Somerville; the Butler\r\nHospital, Rhode Island; the Utica and Bloomingdale Asylums, New York;\r\nthe Trenton Hospital, the Kirkbride Hospital, and the Philadelphia Alms\r\nHouse, and in none of these institutions did we find any person naked\r\nor confined in a cell.  The furiously insane were dressed, the arms\r\nwere tied so as to limit the use of the hands, and the hands were\r\ncovered with padded mittens.  The Worcester Hospital was the poorest\r\ninstitution of all.  Our chairman, the Rev. Orin S. Fowler, afterwards\r\na member of Congress, was very indignant, and his report to the\r\nLegislature aroused the State from its delusion in regard to the\r\nWorcester Hospital.  We examined many sites for the contemplated new\r\nhospitals, but the Legislature postponed action.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1847 I was a member of a committee to examine and\r\nreport upon the securities held by the State.  These securities were\r\nchiefly the property of the Common School Fund, and they had been\r\nderived from the sales of public lands in Maine owned jointly with\r\nthat State under the agreement made at the time of the separation.\r\nAmong these securities was a mortgage upon the property of Nathaniel\r\nJ. Wythe, at Fresh Pond.  Mr. Wythe had been a trapper for John Jacob\r\nAstor, and he had published a pamphlet upon the region of the Rocky\r\nMountains.  Elisha H. Allen afterwards our Consul to Honolulu, and then\r\nChief Justice of Hawaii, and more recently Minister from that country\r\nto the United States, was a member of the committee.  Mr. Allen and\r\nmyself were at Fresh Pond together and under the lead of Wythe we went\r\nto one of his large ice-houses.  The month was August and the men were\r\nengaged in removing ice from the house for loading upon the railway\r\ncars.  From the top of the house to the ground floor must have been\r\nsixty feet or more.  The cakes of ice were sent down in a run, and by\r\nthe side of the run there was a narrow foot track, over which the men\r\npassed.  Mr. Wythe with a lantern led in going up the track to the\r\nheight where the men were at work.  Allen followed and I was behind\r\nAllen.  When we had ascended about one third of the way, the men above\r\nsent down a cake of ice that seemed at first view to threaten the\r\npassengers on the side track.  Allen stepped back and fell outside the\r\ntrack and disappeared in the darkness.  The men were called and by the\r\naid of lights Allen was found in a pit about ten or twelve feet in\r\ndepth that had been made by removing ice.  By the help of a ladder he\r\nwas taken out, much frightened, but not injured seriously.  Mr. Allen\r\nwas the son of Sam. C. Allen of Northfield, formerly a member of\r\nCongress.  Mr. Elisha H. Allen was elected to Congress in 1840 from\r\nthe Bangor district, State of Maine.  He went to Hawaii in 1849 and he\r\nreturned in 1851 or 1852.  Upon his return I had several interviews\r\nwith him as he lived at the Adams House, Boston, for a time, where I\r\nwas then living.  From him I received the impression that he was\r\nauthorized to say to the Secretary of State that the authorities of\r\nHawaii were prepared to enter upon negotiations for the cession of the\r\nIsland to the United States.  I understood from Mr. Allen that Mr.\r\nWebster did not look with favor upon the scheme.  In later years I\r\nrenewed my acquaintance with Mr. Allen.  He was a man of quick\r\nperceptions, of much general information, and as a debater in the\r\nMassachusetts House of Representatives his standing was always good.\r\nAs to his integrity it was never brought into question.\r\n\r\n[* I was elected a member of the American Academy on my birthday, 1857.\r\nJ. Lothrop Motley and Charles Francis Adams were elected at the same\r\ntime.]\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\nLEGISLATIVE SESSION OF 1848--FUNERAL OF JOHN QUINCY ADAMS\r\n\r\nThe chief incident of the Legislative session of 1848 was the funeral\r\nof John Quincy Adams.  Mr. Adams died in February, 1848.  There were\r\nthen twenty-four States in the Union and the House of Representatives\r\nselected one member from each State to accompany the remains of Mr.\r\nAdams to Massachusetts.  Of these members I recall Talmadge of New\r\nYork; Newell* of New Jersey; Kaufmann of Texas; Morse of Louisiana;\r\nWentworth of Illinois; Bingham of Michigan; and Holmes of South\r\nCarolina.  The Massachusetts Legislature appointed a committee of the\r\nsame number to receive the Congressional Committee.  Of that committee\r\nI was a member and George T. Bigelow was the chairman.  Our first\r\nthought was of a hotel and the entertainment of the Committee.\r\n\r\nThe feeling in regard to temperance was active and we foresaw that the\r\ndoings of the committee would be subject to criticism.  Finally,\r\nBigelow suggested that we should go to the Tremont House and say to the\r\nlandlord that we wished him to provide suitable rooms and entertainment\r\nfor the Congressional Committee.  This we did, and nothing was said\r\nabout wines.  At the end we found that the bill was a large one, and\r\nthat the item of wines was a very important item.  It was paid by the\r\nGovernor and Council, and as one member of the committee I was ignorant\r\nof the amount.  The reporters made vain attempts to ascertain the\r\nfacts.  A portion of our committee met the Congressional Committee at\r\nSpringfield.  Many additions had then been made to the twenty-four.  At\r\nWorcester, and perhaps at other places, speeches were made to the\r\nCommittee by the local authorities and speeches in answer were\r\ndelivered by members of the Committee.  Mr. Holmes of South Carolina,\r\nwas one of the speakers.  He was an enthusiastic man, and he was\r\nendowed with a form of popular eloquence quite well adapted to the\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nI was assigned to the charge of Mr. Wentworth of Illinois.  His height\r\nwas such that he was already known as \"Long John.\"  We sat together in\r\nthe train for Quincy on the day of the funeral.  He was a good natured\r\nman, whose greatness was not altogether in the size of his body.  His\r\ntalents were far above mediocrity, indeed, nature had endowed him with\r\npowers of a high order, as I had the opportunity to learn when we were\r\nassociated in Congress.\r\n\r\nTwo banquets were given to the Committee, one by the State at the\r\nTremont House, and one by the City of Boston at the Revere House.  The\r\nnotable event at the Revere House was the speech of Harrison Gray Otis.\r\nMr. Otis was then about eighty years of age.  He was a well preserved\r\ngentleman, and in his deportment, dress and speech he gave evidence of\r\nculture and refinement.  He had been a Federalist and of course he had\r\nbeen a bitter opponent of Mr. Adams.  He seized the occasion to make a\r\ndefence of Federalism, and of the Hartford Convention.  While Mr. Adams\r\nwas President, he had written a pamphlet in vindication of a charge he\r\nhad made, in conversation with Mr. Jefferson, that, during the War of\r\n1812 the Federalists of New England, had contemplated a dissolution of\r\nthe Union, and the establishment of a northern confederacy.  This\r\ncharge Mr. Otis denied and he then proceeded at length to vindicate\r\nthe character of the old Federal Party.  He was a gentleman of\r\nrefinement of manners, but as I sat near him at the Revere House\r\ndinner, I overheard enough of his private conversation with Holmes of\r\nSouth Carolina, to satisfy me that he had a relish for coarse remarks,\r\nif they had in them a flavor of wit or humor.\r\n\r\nThe old controversy between John Quincy Adams, and the Federalists of\r\nBoston, once saved me, and helped me to escape from a position in\r\nwhich I found myself by an indiscretion in debate.  In 1843 the office\r\nof Attorney-General was abolished, by the active efforts of the\r\nDemocrats aided by the passiveness of the Whigs.  The Democrats thought\r\nthe office unnecessary, the Whigs were content to have it abolished,\r\nthat the party might get rid of the incumbent, James T. Austin.  At a\r\nsubsequent session of the Judiciary Committee, of which George Lunt was\r\na member, he reported a bill for the establishment of the office.  Mr.\r\nLunt was a poet, a lawyer, and a politician, and without excellence in\r\neither walk.  In public life he was destitute of the ability to adapt\r\nhimself to his surroundings.  In those days the farmers constituted a\r\nmajority of the House.  They were generally men of intelligence, and\r\nthey held about the same relation to the business of the House, that\r\njuries hold to the business of the Courts.  They listened to the\r\narguments, reasoned upon the case, and not infrequently the decision\r\nwas made by them.  Occasionally they gave a verdict upon a party\r\nquestion, adverse to the arguments of the leaders of the party in\r\npower.  In his opening argument, Mr. Lunt was unwise, to a degree\r\nunusual even for him.\r\n\r\nThe question he maintained was one which lawyers alone were competent\r\nto understand, and he also maintained that the majority of the House\r\nought to accept their views.  \"The question\" said he \"is _sui generis.\"_\r\n\r\nI was opposed to the bill.  At that time Richard Fletcher, then\r\nrecently a member of Congress, had been engaged in a controversy with\r\nthe Boston _Atlas,_ a leading organ of the Whig Party.  A question of\r\nveracity was raised and to the disadvantage of Fletcher.  Thereupon he\r\nresigned his seat in the House and returned to Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nMr. Frank B. Crowninshield was opposed to the bill, and anxious to\r\nsecure its defeat, but he was unwilling to take the responsibility of\r\ncontributing openly to that result.  Privately he informed me that the\r\npurpose was to make a place for Fletcher.  In the course of my remarks,\r\nin reply to Lunt I said that if the object of the managers was to\r\nprovide a place for a man who had fallen into discredit, in another\r\nbranch of the public service, then as far as I knew, the bill was _sui\r\ngeneris._\r\n\r\nSeveral members, among them General William Schouler, disclaimed all\r\nknowledge of any arrangement such as I had referred to.  These\r\nassertions of ignorance were not troublesome, but Otis P. Lord, of\r\nSalem, rose and after many personal compliments said \"I call upon the\r\nmember from Groton to give his authority for the suggestion he makes in\r\nregard to the purpose of this bill.\"  At that moment my mind reverted\r\nto the controversy between Adams and the Federalists.\r\n\r\nIn 1825 or 1826 Mr. Jefferson wrote a letter that was printed in the\r\n_National Intelligencer,_ in which he gave his version of statements\r\nmade by Mr. Adams.  Among others he said that Mr. Adams had told him\r\nthat he had evidence of the purpose of the Federalists during the War\r\nof 1812 to secure a dissolution of the Union, and the organization of\r\nan eastern confederacy.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams wrote a letter in which he explained some of Mr. Jefferson's\r\nstatements, but of this he took no notice.  Its accuracy, therefore,\r\nwas admitted.  Thereupon the Federalists of Boston, wrote to President\r\nAdams, demanding his authority for the statement.  That authority he\r\nrefused to give.  Alluding to the many names appended to the letter of\r\nthe Federalists, he said:  \"No array of numbers or of talent shall\r\ninduce me to make the disclosure sooner than my sense of duty requires,\r\nand when that time arrives, no array of numbers or talent shall deter\r\nme from it.\"  After some remarks intended to connect the Whig and\r\nFederal parties I repeated the conclusion of Mr. Adams' pamphlet and\r\nmade my escape in the smoke.  Crowninshield sat upon the dais in front\r\nof the speaker during the debate.  I made no allusion to him, for I\r\ncommanded my faculties sufficiently to enable me to realize that if he\r\ndenied my allegations the denial would be fatal to my standing, and\r\nthat he would be seriously injured if he accepted my statement.  The\r\nevent taught me a lesson, and thenceforward I have avoided all\r\nreference in debate to private conversations.\r\n\r\n[* Mr. Newell is the only member living, March, 1901.]\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\nTHE LEGISLATURE OF 1849\r\n\r\nIn the year 1849, two men were elected to the Massachusetts House of\r\nRepresentatives who have had conspicuous careers in the State and\r\nnation,--General Nathaniel P. Banks and Henry L. Dawes.  General Banks\r\nhad genius for politics and the generalities of public affairs.  As an\r\norator he was peculiar and attractive to an unusual degree.  For a long\r\nperiod his popularity was great in his town and district, and finally\r\nin the State.  A long life was the possession of General Banks, and I\r\nhave only to consider how its opportunities were treated, and its\r\nduties performed.  The beginnings of his life were humble enough, but\r\nthe beginnings of life, whether humble or otherwise, are of no\r\nconsiderable consequence to strong characters.\r\n\r\nGeneral Banks' public career began with his election to the\r\nMassachusetts House of Representatives, when he was far along in his\r\nthirty-third year.  His eminence as a debater and his pre-eminence as\r\na parliamentarian, were established without much delay, and in 1851 he\r\nwas raised to the speaker's chair.  In 1852, he was again elected\r\nspeaker of the house, and in 1853, and without debate, he was chosen to\r\npreside over the Constitutional Convention.  He was then elected to\r\nCongress, and thenceforward he was a conspicuous personality in the\r\ngreat events of the war; both on the civil and military side of\r\naffairs.  He achieved distinction in the Thirty-third Congress, and\r\nafter a long and bitter contest in the Thirty-fourth Congress, he was\r\nelected speaker of the House of Representatives.  His associates in\r\nthat House gave him rank next to Mr. Clay, and through tradition that\r\nrank is still accorded to him.\r\n\r\nDuring his administration as Governor of the State, from 1858 to 1861,\r\nhe made military preparations for that contest of arms, which even\r\nthen was thought by some not to be improbable and by a few thought to\r\nbe inevitable.  It was during that period that he delivered the\r\naddress at the dedication of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at\r\nCambridge.  The address met most fully the expectations of the\r\nauthorities at Cambridge, and it gave General Banks standing as an\r\norator when Massachusetts had orators--Everett, Choate, Phillips,\r\nHillard,--and when Harrison Gray Otis and Webster had not been\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the war Mr. Lincoln tendered to General Banks a\r\ncommission of the first rank, and a command of corresponding\r\nimportance.  He had not received a military education, and he was\r\nwithout experience in military life.  His selection was due to a\r\ngeneral and well founded opinion that he possessed military qualities,\r\ncourage and decision, and that he was inspired by a deep devotion to\r\nthe Union.  General Banks was a firm believer in the justice of our\r\ncause, and he was animated by an unbounded confidence in our success,--\r\na confidence which was not impaired in the darkest days of the Civil\r\nWar.  After the passing of a third of a century, a review of the entire\r\nfield on the Civil side does not reveal a character more worthy than\r\nGeneral Banks of high military command.  In all the vicissitudes of his\r\nmilitary career, and success did not always wait upon his undertakings,\r\nhe never lost the confidence of Mr. Lincoln, nor Mr. Stanton, who was\r\nthe most exacting of men, whenever an officer failed in his duties.\r\n\r\nGeneral Banks' military career may be considered in three parts.  As to\r\nthe campaigns of 1861 and 1862, on the Potomac, and in the valley of\r\nthe Shenandoah, it is to be said that his fortunes were in the main\r\nthe fortunes of McDowell, McClellan, and Pope, yet even in the presence\r\nof general disaster, he gained distinction by his courage, resolution,\r\nand equanimity of temper.  The capture of Port Hudson, undertaken and\r\naccomplished under his command, opened the Mississippi River below\r\nVicksburg to military operations and to business intercourse.  The\r\nevent was second only in importance to the surrender of Vicksburg.\r\n\r\nThe Red River campaign was an ill advised undertaking, for which\r\nGeneral Banks was in no degree responsible.  Indeed, he advised against\r\nthe movement.  This I say upon his specific statement made to me.  The\r\nundertaking was a great error.  There never was a day after April,\r\n1861, when it was not apparent that the south-western portion of the\r\nunion, beyond the Mississippi River, would yield whenever that river\r\nwas opened to the Gulf, and the army of Lee had capitulated.  Hence the\r\nunwisdom of the undertaking.  It is sufficient to say that nothing\r\noccurred in that campaign which was discreditable to General Banks.\r\nThe obstacles were too great to have been overcome, and nothing in the\r\nnature of success could have been attained by Sherman or Grant.  I turn\r\nagain to the aspect of General Banks' career on the civil side.\r\n\r\nIn knowledge of parliamentary law and in ability to administer that law\r\nit may be claimed justly that General Banks had no rival in his\r\ngeneration.  As a speaker he approached the rank of an orator, if he\r\ndid not attain to it.  His presence was stately and attractive, his\r\nvoice was agreeable, far reaching and commanding, and his control of an\r\naudience was absolute, for the time being.  That his auditors may at\r\ntimes have differed from his conclusions but only when the speech was\r\nended, and the spell was broken, is evidence of his power as a speaker.\r\n\r\nThat he came into public life as the associate and rival of Sumner,\r\nWilson, and Burlingame, and that in his whole career as a public man he\r\nkept his equal place to the end, and that in Congress he suffered\r\nnothing when compared with the able men who occupied seats in the lower\r\nHouse between the year 1850 and the year 1870, give him rank as one of\r\nthe foremost statesmen of his time.  If it be said that his name is not\r\nidentified with any important measure of the government the same may be\r\nsaid of Mr. Sumner, of Mr. Wilson, of Mr. Conkling, and others, whose\r\nspeeches and opinions have had large influence upon the policy of the\r\ncountry.  A great measure is the result of many causes and in its\r\npromulgation it may bear the name of a person whose contribution has\r\nbeen insignificant relatively.\r\n\r\nGeneral Banks had aptitude for public affairs--an aptitude which\r\napproached genius.  His mind dwelt upon great projects, and never upon\r\npetty schemes, nor upon intrigues as a means of success.  His warfare\r\nwas a bold one, and in the open field.  In politics he was deficient in\r\norganizing qualities, but he had unbounded confidence in his own\r\nability and in the ability of his associates and friends to command and\r\nto retain popular support.  As to himself, that confidence rested upon\r\nan adequate basis.  In the last fifty years there has been no other man\r\nin Massachusetts who was as generously supported, and by people of all\r\nclasses.  For the masses, who saw him and who knew him, only as he\r\nappeared on the platform, there was an inspiration in his presence and\r\nin his speeches, and for his associates and friends there was a\r\ngenerous companionship which none could resist--which none wished to\r\nresist.  In his private life there was no malice in his intercourse\r\nwith men; in the strife of war there was no vindictiveness in spirit\r\nnor in the means of prosecuting war.\r\n\r\nA patriotic man, who trusted the people, and a man whom the people\r\ntrusted; a brave soldier, who retained the confidence of his troops,\r\nand of his superiors in all the vicissitudes of war; a friend whose\r\nfriendship was not changed nor tempered by the changing events of life.\r\nSuch was General Banks to many and to myself, his companion, and often\r\nco-worker, and always friend through a lengthened half century.\r\n\r\nMr. Dawes was not a leader in the Massachusetts House of\r\nRepresentatives and no one could then have predicted his success in\r\npublic life.  Something of what the world calls fortune has attended\r\nhim.  He possessed the quality or faculty of industry, but his studies\r\ndid not extend beyond the current demands of the situation.  As a\r\nlawyer he was not distinguished.  He had none of the qualities of an\r\norator, indeed it was not always a pleasure to listen to his speeches.\r\nHis manners were not attractive, and of genial wit he was wholly\r\ninnocent.  He had a power of sarcasm, and in his speeches he presented\r\nhimself in the phase of umpire often, although at times he appeared in\r\nthe aspect of a contestant.  Indeed, this was in his nature.  He was a\r\nthorough partisan who seemed unwilling to own the fact.  His friends\r\ncould not claim for him any of the qualities for which successful men\r\nare commonly distinguished, and yet he has been one of the most\r\nsuccessful men that the State has produced.  Such success must rest on\r\na substantial basis of merit.\r\n\r\nFor a single term, between 1846 and 1850 Benjamin R. Curtis was a\r\nmember of the House.  He had already acquired fame as a jurist.  His\r\nspeeches in the house were the speeches that he made to courts and\r\njuries.  He was destitute of genius, and his speeches exhibited no\r\nvariety of talent.  They were adapted to the argument of questions of\r\nlaw before a court; hence he was not successful as a jury lawyer, and\r\nhis speeches in the house were usually convincing, although they were\r\nnever attractive.  Judge Curtis' intellectual faculties matured early.\r\nMr. Wilde, for many years the clerk of the court of Suffolk, expressed\r\nto me the opinion that Judge Curtis' first argument was as good as his\r\nlast argument.  There can be no doubt, however, that his legal\r\narguments were unrivalled in recent times.  He was equipped with all\r\nthe legal learning that could be required in any case.  He had the\r\ncapacity to see the points on which a case must turn, and he had the\r\ncourage to pass over the immaterial facts, and points in which other\r\nmen often lay stress to the injury of their arguments, and to the\r\nannoyance of the courts.  In his arguments in the impeachment case of\r\nPresident Johnson, he furnished the only ground on which the Senate\r\ncould stand in rendering a verdict of not guilty.\r\n\r\nDuring his service in the House he introduced an extraordinary bill\r\nwhich received little or no support from the members.  By that bill it\r\nwas made a misdemeanor to flow the land of another for any purpose\r\nwhatsoever, thus changing the ancient Mill Act of the State; provided,\r\nhowever, that it should not apply to any citizen of Massachusetts.  It\r\nwas said that Curtis had a client whose land had been flowed by a\r\nRhode Island man, and not being willing to pursue him in the courts of\r\nthe United States, he framed the bill in question.  Of course the bill\r\nfailed.  Again in 1851 he gave an opinion that Sumner, Wilson, myself\r\nand perhaps some others, could be indicted for the coalition by which\r\nthe Whig Party was driven from power in Massachusetts.  The opinion was\r\nprinted secretly and read in the Whig caucus, where it received so\r\nlittle support that it was suppressed.  When the parties had\r\ndisappeared, I read a copy that had been preserved in the office of the\r\nBoston _Journal._\r\n\r\nJudge Curtis was a jurist, and that only.  He had no literary taste in\r\nthe true sense, although the statement has been made that he was a\r\nconstant reader of novels.  However that may have been, his speeches\r\nwere seldom if ever adorned or burdened by illustrations or references\r\noutside of the books of the profession.\r\n\r\nGeorge T. Curtis, a brother of Benjamin R., was a member of the House\r\nfor several years, between 1840 and 1850.  With the overthrow of the\r\nWhig Party in 1851, he disappeared from the politics of the State, and\r\nat about the same time he removed to New York.  As a writer he is clear\r\nand methodical, but from choice or fortune many of his subjects have\r\nnot been acceptable, and his treatment of his subjects has been counter\r\nusually to the general opinion of the country.  As the son-in-law of\r\nJudge Story and the brother of Judge Curtis, there was a general\r\nexpectation that his career would be distinguished.  That expectation\r\nwas not realized.  His self-conceit was unbounded.  That defect made\r\nhim unpopular with his professional brethren, and at last it alienated\r\nhis clients.  Even Mr. Choate, the gentlest of men, could not endure\r\nMr. Curtis.  Of him he said, \"Some men we hate for cause, but George\r\nT. Curtis we hate peremptorily.\"\r\n\r\nCharles P. Curtis was also a member of the House for many years.  He\r\nwas a more genial man than either the Judge or George T.  The three\r\nconstituted the fraternity known as _the Curtii._  Chief Justice Shaw,\r\nwho had married a Curtis, was also included in the brotherhood.\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\nMASSACHUSETTS POLITICS AND MASSACHUSETTS POLITICIANS\r\n1850-51 AND 1852\r\n\r\nThe defeat of General Cass in 1848 changed the policy of the leaders of\r\nthe Democratic Party in Massachusetts.  These leaders were David\r\nHenshaw, Charles G. Greene, and as an assistant Benjamin F. Hallett.\r\nThe first two had controlled the patronage of the general government\r\nvery largely during the administrations of Jackson, Van Buren and Polk.\r\nThey looked to the election of General Cass as a continuation of that\r\npolicy.  These leaders considered the control of Massachusetts as\r\nhopeless, and not unlikely they considered the national patronage as\r\nmore valuable than the offices of the State.  Hence they were ready to\r\nendorse whatever the Washington authorities demanded.  Consequently\r\nour platforms tended to alienate voters rather than to attract them.\r\nThis policy was very disagreeable to the younger members of the party,\r\nbut they were unable to resist it.  The Boston _Post,_ owned by Colonel\r\nGreene, was the leading Democratic paper in the State.  Many of the\r\ncountry papers followed its lead.  The Worcester _Palladium_ was an\r\nexception, but its influence was limited.\r\n\r\nGreene and Hallett attributed the defeat of General Cass to the\r\ndefection of the South and for the time they were disposed to sanction\r\nor to permit a policy of retaliation.  Consequently the State\r\nConvention of 1849 was disposed to utter the sentiments of the party\r\nin regard to slavery.  For many years Hallett had been the chairman of\r\nthe Committee on Resolutions.  He was designated for that position in\r\n1849.  The Free-soil Party had already become a power in the State.\r\nIt was led by men who had been prominent in the Whig Party in its last\r\ndays.  Hallett reported a resolution in which was this expression:\r\n\"We are opposed to slavery throughout all God's heritage.\"  When the\r\nDemocratic Party regained power in 1853 this declaration threatened to\r\nimpede Hallett in his plans for office and influence.  Pierce made\r\nallowances for the circumstances and rewarded Hallett with the office\r\nof district attorney.  The resolutions, however, tended to conciliate\r\nthe anti-slavery element of the State and in many towns and in some of\r\nthe counties the Democrats and Free-soilers coalesced and elected a\r\nformidable minority of the Legislature.  The result of the coalition\r\ndemonstrated the possibility of a combination which could control the\r\nState.  The Convention gave me the nomination, and without any serious\r\nopposition.  Stephen C. Phillips of Salem, was the candidate of the\r\nFree-soil Party.  Together we had a majority of the popular vote, and\r\nGovernor Briggs was elected Governor by the Legislature.  The plurality\r\nrule had not then been adopted.\r\n\r\nIn 1850 each of the three parties nominated the same candidates and the\r\ncoalition in the towns, cities and counties was much more complete.\r\nThe victory was decisive.  When the Legislature assembled, Henry\r\nWilson, Free-soiler, was chosen president of the Senate and General\r\nBanks, Democrat, was chosen speaker of the House.  The candidates of\r\nthe Democratic Party were elected to the office of Governor and\r\nLieutenant Governor.  The council was divided between the parties.  The\r\nselection of a candidate for the Senate was left for the Free-soil\r\nParty.  The choice fell upon Mr. Sumner, although there was a large\r\npublic sentiment, especially in the Democratic Party, in favor of Mr.\r\nPhillips.  Such was my own opinion at the time, but the result showed\r\nthe wisdom or good fortune of the selection that was made.  Mr.\r\nPhillips was a man of education, a merchant by profession, and a\r\ngentleman who enjoyed the confidence of the public.  He was an Anti-\r\nSlavery man upon principle, but his intellectual movements were slow,\r\nand his power as a forensic speaker was moderate only.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1851, when these events were occurring, the prospects of\r\nthe National Democratic Party had improved.  The Henshaw wing of the\r\nparty in Massachusetts were anticipating a success in 1852.  Mr.\r\nWebster had made his famous and fatal speech on the 7th of March, 1850.\r\nPresident Taylor had died, and Mr. Fillmore was President.  He had\r\nreorganized the Cabinet and endorsed the Compromise Measures, and\r\nfinally the Whig Party was divided, hopelessly.  In this condition of\r\naffairs, Greene and Hallett entered upon a vigorous opposition to the\r\nelection of Sumner.  The Boston _Post_ called upon the Democratic\r\nmembers of the House to oppose his election.  About twenty-eight\r\nmembers known as \"old hunkers\" followed the lead of the _Post._  After\r\na long contest Mr. Sumner was elected by a single vote.  As far as I\r\nknow, Mr. Sumner was not a party to any arrangement as to a division of\r\nthe offices, and I am sure that I was never consulted upon the subject.\r\nAs far as arrangements were made, they were made by members of the\r\nLegislature.  The members had been elected by a coalition among the\r\npeople and they executed the will of the people.  The vacant places\r\nwere filled by representative men from each of the parties.  While the\r\nstruggle over the election of Senator was going on, the Legislature\r\nproceeded to elect a Senator for the term that was to expire the 4th\r\nof March, 1851.  It was the seat that Mr. Webster had vacated to take\r\nthe office of Secretary of State under Mr. Fillmore.  Governor Briggs\r\nhad appointed Robert C. Winthrop to the vacancy.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature elected Robert Rantoul, Jr., to the vacancy.  Mr.\r\nRantoul was then in the West, and his address was not known to any one.\r\nMr. Ezra Lincoln, a friend to Mr. Winthrop, came to me and said that\r\nMr. Winthrop wished to have Mr. Rantoul's credentials sent to him, as\r\nhe should feel unpleasant if they were sent to any one else.\r\nAccordingly they were so sent.  In a few days Mr. Lincoln called and\r\nsaid that Mr. Winthrop wished to know whether he should present the\r\ncredentials at once, or hold them until Mr. Rantoul appeared.  I said\r\nin reply that I was the agent of the Legislature for the transmission\r\nof the certificate, and that I did not feel at liberty to give\r\ninstructions.  Thereupon Mr. Winthrop presented the credentials of Mr.\r\nRantoul, and retired from the Senate.  This act was followed by attacks\r\nupon me, by Senators and by newspapers, the charge being that I had\r\ndriven Mr. Winthrop from the Senate and at a time when an important\r\nquestion relating to the tariff was pending.  Neither Mr. Winthrop nor\r\nany of his friends made any explanation.  Mr. Lincoln came to me and\r\nexpressed his regrets that the attacks had been made, and he\r\nvolunteered to use his influence with the _Daily Advertiser,_ and\r\ninduce it to suspend its attacks.  This he did, I presume, as that\r\npaper made no further allusion to the subject.  As for myself, I\r\nremained silent, following a rule that I had formed early in life, to\r\navoid public controversy concerning my own acts.  This rule, however,\r\nwas not an inflexible one.\r\n\r\nMr. Winthrop was then a candidate for the Senate against Mr. Sumner.\r\nHe was sensitive, no doubt, and he may have felt that it was his duty\r\nto present Mr. Rantoul's credentials without delay.  That was the\r\nproper course, probably, and the question whether his term in the\r\nSenate was continued a few days was of no public or personal\r\nconsequences whatsoever.  Up to that point Mr. Winthrop's career had\r\nbeen one of uninterrupted success.  He was the favorite of Boston, and\r\nhe belonged to an old and venerated family.  His talents were of a high\r\norder, his education the best that the times afforded, his character\r\nwithout a blemish, and there was no reason arising from personal\r\nconditions why he should not have become the representative man of the\r\nState.  With the event mentioned, his public life ended.  Mr. Sumner\r\nwas elected to the Senate.  The next year the Whig Party nominated Mr.\r\nWinthrop and I was brought into direct competition with him.  Again he\r\nfailed.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1855, the Republican Party was organized, a committee waited\r\nupon Mr. Winthrop, and invited him to join the movement.  His public\r\nrecord was satisfactory upon the slavery question, that is, it was\r\nbetter than that of many others who became Republicans.  He declined to\r\ntake a position, and gave as a reason that he was unwilling to act with\r\nthe men who were leading the movement.  He named Sumner, and Wilson.\r\nIf his decision had been otherwise, it is quite doubtful if his nerve\r\nwould have been equal to the contests through which the Republican\r\nParty was destined to pass.  Mr. Winthrop had in him nothing of the\r\nrevolutionary spirit.  In England, in the times of Cromwell he would\r\nhave followed the fortunes of the Stuarts, and it is difficult to\r\nimagine him as the associate of Samuel Adams, John Adams, and Thomas\r\nJefferson, in Revolutionary days.\r\n\r\nMr. Rantoul appeared in the Senate after a few days, and his term\r\nlasted about twenty days, giving him an opportunity to make one speech.\r\nHe was afterwards elected to the House of Representatives from the\r\nEssex District, and died while a member at the age of forty-seven\r\nyears.  His death was a serious loss to the anti-slavery Democrats of\r\nMassachusetts and the country.  He was one of the three distinguished\r\nmen that the county of Essex has produced in his century:  Choate,\r\nCushing and Rantoul.  In oratorical power he could not be compared to\r\nChoate.  In learning he was of the three the least well equipped.  In\r\nlogic he was superior to Cushing, and he was more direct, and more\r\neasily comprehended than either Cushing or Choate.  He had not much\r\nimagination, and his illustrations were simple and rather commonplace.\r\nAs a debater he has had but few equals in our State.  He was a radical,\r\na reformer by nature.  He was opposed to capital punishment, an\r\nadvocate of temperance, of prison reform, and a zealous free trader.\r\nHe made war upon the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 contending that the\r\nConstitution imposed upon the States the duty of returning fugitives\r\nfrom labor.  This theory seemed to me at the time, as the result of a\r\nviolent construction of the Constitution, and so it seems to me now.\r\nNevertheless it satisfied many who wised to oppose the Fugitive Slave\r\nLaw, and sustain the Constitution at the same time.\r\n\r\nDuring the Senatorial contest I was urged by the supporters of Sumner\r\nto aid his election, and by the \"hunker\" wing of the Democratic Party\r\n--I was urged to bring the influence of the administration to bear\r\nagainst Mr. Sumner.  To all I made the same reply.  I said:  \"I am not\r\npledged to elect Mr. Sumner, I am not pledged to defeat him.  The\r\nsubject is in the control of the Legislature.\"  I did, however, delay\r\nmaking removals and appointments and upon the ground that the election\r\nor defeat of Mr. Sumner would affect the appointments to office in the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nMr. Cushing had a violent prejudice against shoemakers.  Under the\r\ncoalition, Wilson became president of the Senate, Amasa Walker,\r\nSecretary of the Commonwealth, John B. Alley, a Senator, and member of\r\nthe Council, all shoemakers, or interested in the shoe and leather\r\ntrade.  In addition to these there were many persons of prominence and\r\ninfluence in the party who were in the same business.  The \"shoe towns\"\r\ngenerally supported the Free-soil Party.  One morning I received a call\r\nfrom Mr. Cushing, before I had taken my breakfast.  Evidently he had\r\nhad a conference with the leading \"hunkers\" who had deputed him to\r\nstate their case to me.  After considerable conversation, which perhaps\r\nwas not satisfactory to Mr. Cushing, he put this question to me, and\r\nwith great emphasis:  \"What I wish to know, Governor, is whether this\r\nState is to be 'shoemakerized' or not?\"  With a laugh I said, \"General,\r\nI cannot tell, whether it is to be 'shoemakerized' or not.\"  Upon this\r\nthe general left.  When he had had interviews with Greene and Hallett,\r\nhe became anxious for Sumner's defeat; when he was with the\r\ncoalitionists he would become, in a measure, reconciled to his\r\nelection.  The truth was, Cushing was destitute of convictions.  By his\r\nresidence in the east he had lost faith in our religion, in our\r\ncivilization, and, in a degree, in our political system.  However, he\r\nhad no stronger faith in any other system.  His purposes were not bad,\r\nand his disposition to aid others was a charming feature of his\r\ncharacter.  He would oblige an associate whenever he could do so.  As\r\na legislator he would perfect bills that he did not approve, and his\r\nstores of knowledge were at the service of any one who chose to make\r\nrequests of him.  Indeed he often volunteered information and\r\nsuggestions.  His reading was so vast and his experience so great,\r\nthat his professional arguments were often over-loaded.  As a jurist\r\nhis influence with courts was limited.  He did not aid the judicial\r\nmind.  It was seldom necessary for the court to either accept or\r\nanswer his arguments.  On one occasion, he commenced an argument to the\r\nSupreme Court of Massachusetts with the obscure philosophical\r\nobservation:  \"An impossibility is the greatest possible fact.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Cushing was learned in many ways, but his faculties were not\r\npractical, and he was too much inclined to adhere to the existing\r\npowers, and consequently he was ready to change whenever a new party\r\nor a new set of men attained authority.  As an official, he would obey\r\ninstructions, and as an assistant in legal, historical, or diplomatic\r\nresearches, he had no rival.  He attained to high positions, and yet he\r\nwas never fully trusted by any administration or party.  His personal\r\nhabits were peculiar.  In later years, his economy degenerated into\r\nparsimony.  This may have been due in part to his lack of financial\r\nskill.  First and last he was led into many unprofitable undertakings,\r\nand as a results, his patrimony, which was something, and his\r\nprofessional earnings which were considerable, were consumed.  He was\r\nin debt usually, and he limited his expenses that he might meet his\r\nliabilities.  He was eccentric.  I have met him at evening\r\nentertainments arrayed in a dress suit with a bright red ribbon for a\r\nnecktie.\r\n\r\nGeneral Cushing had great qualities, but he was not a great man.  He\r\nhad immense capacity that he could use in aid of others, but he lacked\r\nability to mark out a course for himself, or he lacked tenacity or\r\npurpose in pursuing it.  His ambition had no limits, and he would\r\nswerve from his personal obligations in the pursuit of place.  In my\r\nadministration he was made a judge of the Supreme Court of the State,\r\nand upon an understanding that he would retain the place.  During the\r\nfew months that he was upon the bench, he gave promise of success, but\r\nupon the election of President Pierce, he could not resist the offer of\r\na seat in his Cabinet.  As Attorney-General he did not add materially\r\nto his reputation, but his opinions are distinguished for research and\r\nfor learning.  The nomination of Pierce was promoted by the officers\r\nwho had served in Mexico.  Previous to the Democratic Convention of\r\n1852, Gideon J. Pillow came to Boston, and he and General Cushing\r\nvisited Pierce in New Hampshire.  They also called upon me and laid\r\nopen a scheme in which they invited me to take a part.  It was in fact\r\na project for an organization inside the Democratic Party, by which the\r\naction of the party should be controlled.  First, a central\r\norganization composed of a few men self-constituted; next a small\r\nnumber of assistants in each State who were to organize through\r\nconfidential agents in the counties, cities and large towns.  All these\r\nagencies through newspapers and by other expedient means would be able,\r\nit was thought, to control the party nominations, and the party policy.\r\nI had then declined a renomination to the office of Governor, and I was\r\nable to say with truth, that I intended to retire from active\r\nparticipation in politics.  I declined to consider the subject further.\r\nWhether or not the scheme was matured, I have no knowledge.\r\n\r\nThat campaign and his transfer to Pierce's Cabinet led Cushing to adopt\r\nthe views of southern men upon the slavery question, and his unwise\r\nspeeches and letters interrupted his success, finally, and at a moment\r\nwhen success was most important to him.  In the autumn or early in\r\nDecember, 1860, he made a succession of speeches at Newburyport which\r\nwere calculated to promote the views of the Secessionists.  At about\r\nthe same time he wrote a letter which was read before the Republican\r\nSenatorial Caucus, when his name was before the Senate for confirmation\r\nas Chief Justice of the United States.  That letter compelled President\r\nGrant to withdraw the nomination.  At a period during the war General\r\nCushing was disposed to enter the army, and there was a movement in\r\nfavor of his appointment as Brigadier-General.  Andrew, Sumner, and\r\nsome others, appeared in opposition, and the appointment was not made.\r\n\r\nWhile I held the office of Secretary of the Treasury, General Cushing\r\ngave to a friend of mine, and to myself, an invitation to drive out to\r\nhis farm, the Van Ness place, about six miles from Washington, on the\r\nVirginia heights, and take tea with him.  After business we drove to\r\nhis farm.  I took a seat with Cushing in his buggy-wagon, and my\r\nfriend followed in another vehicle.  As we were passing through\r\nGeorgetown, we stopped at a shop where Cushing obtained a loaf of\r\nbread.  Upon reaching his place we were taken over the land.  Its\r\nquality was inferior and it showed the neglect of former owners, and\r\nthere were indications that the present owner had done little or\r\nnothing for its improvement.  The foreman was a Virginian, with but\r\nlittle knowledge of farming.  The house-keeping was crude.  The table\r\nwas a coarse one.  There was neither tablecloth nor napkins.  The\r\nrepast consisted of tea, the bread purchased on the way, soft butter,\r\ncold corned beef, and blackberries.  When we entered the room Mr.\r\nCushing went to a bureau, and took from a drawer a package which\r\ncontained steel knives and forks, such as I had been accustomed to sell\r\nwhen a boy in a country store.  From the appearance the cutlery had\r\nnever been used, but its antiquity was marked by spots of rust.\r\n\r\nThis incident shows the democratic side of Mr. Cushing's character.  He\r\nhad also an aristocratic side.  During General Grant's administration,\r\na Mr. Kennedy, who had been a merchant at Troy, New York, came to\r\nWashington and distinguished himself by his somewhat ostentatious\r\nentertainments to diplomats and other notable persons.  This proceeding\r\nannoyed Mr. Cushing, and he gave voice to his feelings in this manner:\r\n--\"Mr. Kennedy, an ironmonger, comes here from Troy and sets himself\r\nup as a personage.  He is not a personage at all, sir:  not at all,\r\nsir.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I became Governor in January, 1851, there were a large number of\r\noffices at the disposal of the Governor and Council.  Of these there\r\nwere sheriffs, district attorneys, registers of probate, clerks of\r\ncourts, and registers of deeds.  There were also individual places\r\nthat were subject to executive control.  As a general fact, and I do\r\nnot recall an exception, all the officers were filled with Whigs.  We\r\nentered upon a policy of removing the incumbents and appointing\r\nmembers of the Democratic and Free-soil parties.\r\n\r\nI made one notable exception.  John H. Clifford was Attorney-General.\r\nI retained him while I held the office of Governor, and he became my\r\nsuccessor.  A part of his capital was in the circumstance that I had\r\nshown confidence in him.  He was a good officer and an upright man, but\r\nhe lacked the quality which enables a man to reach conclusions.  This\r\npeculiarity made him useful to me.  He would investigate a subject,\r\ngive me the authorities, and precedents, and leave the conclusions to\r\nme.  Next, there was no one in the administration party whom I wished\r\nto appoint.  Mr. Hallett was the candidate most generally supported.\r\nHe was full of prejudices and he was not well instructed as a lawyer.\r\nIn these respects Clifford was his opposite.  I chose, therefore, to\r\nretain Clifford and submit to the criticisms of my party supporters.\r\n\r\nAmong the persons removed was Mr. Fiske, register of probate for the\r\ncounty of Middlesex.  In 1854 the citizens of Fitchburg and the\r\nadjoining town petitioned the Legislature for an act authorizing a new\r\ncounty to be formed of towns from the counties of Middlesex and\r\nWorcester.  Mr. Choate appeared for the petitioners.  Emory Washburn\r\nappeared for the county of Worcester and I was retained for the county\r\nof Middlesex.  One point in our defence was to show that the Middlesex\r\ntowns were not subject to any inconvenience.  In the list of witnesses\r\nfurnished by the county commissioners was the name of Mr. Fiske.  When\r\nI read his name I had a feeling that he might give me some trouble, as\r\nI knew that he was very bitter in his feelings.  When he came upon the\r\nstand I approached him gently.  After the customary questions, I said:\r\n--\"Mr. Fiske, have you held office in the county of Middlesex?\"  \"Yes,\r\nsir.  I was register of probate from 1823 to 1851, when I was removed\r\nby Governor Boutwell,--the meanest act but one, that I ever knew.\"\r\nBeing so far in, and subject to considerable laughter from the\r\naudience, I thought it safe to go farther, and I said:--\"Will you be\r\nkind enough to mention the meaner act that you have in mind?\"  \"That\r\nI was not reappointed by Governor Clifford when he had the power.\"\r\nHaving thus unburdened his mind, the ex-register gave very satisfactory\r\ntestimony.\r\n\r\nOne of the important events that occurred during my administration was\r\nthe ceremony in honor of the opening of railway communication with\r\nCanada.  Distinguished persons were present.  President Fillmore; Mr.\r\nWebster; Mr. Stuart and Mr. Conrad of his Cabinet; Lord Elgin,\r\nGovernor-General of Canada; Sir Francis Hincks, Attorney-General of\r\nCanada, and afterwards Governor-General of Jamaica; Joseph Howe,\r\nProvincial Secretary of Nova Scotia; the Governors of several New\r\nEngland States, and others whose names I do not recall.  The time was\r\nSeptember, 1851.  Mr. Webster arrived in Boston a few days in advance\r\nof the President and took rooms at the Revere House.  I called to see\r\nhim.  In the course of the interview he said that whenever the State\r\nappeared he would be ready to take part if invited to do so, but as to\r\nthe city he should have nothing to do with it.  This resolution was due\r\nto the circumstance that the city government in the preceding year had\r\nrefused the use of Faneuil Hall that he might speak in explanation and\r\nvindication of his speech of the 7th of March, 1850.  John P. Bigelow\r\nwas Mayor of the city in 1850, and he was also Mayor in 1851.  Mr.\r\nWebster also said that when the State authorities made their formal\r\ncall upon the President, he should be glad to introduce the members of\r\nthe government.  Upon the arrival of the President, the officers of\r\nthe State government, to the number of about twenty, called at the\r\nRevere House, where we were received by J. Thomas Stevenson, a personal\r\nand political friend of Mr. Webster.  He informed Mr. Webster of our\r\npresence, and Mr. Webster soon appeared.  He was dressed in what was\r\nknown as his court dress.  A blue coat with bright buttons, buff vest,\r\nblack trousers, and patent leather shoes.  His white cravat was high\r\nand thick, over which was turned a wide collar.  After the gentlemen\r\nhad been presented, he took me by the arm and we proceeded to the\r\nreception room of the President.  At the moment of our arrival Mayor\r\nBigelow was presenting the members of the city government.  At once\r\nMr. Webster became excited, and advancing to the President, he took\r\npossession of the ground, treating the Mayor as though he were a dog\r\nunder his feet.  He introduced us in a loud voice, and at the end he\r\nseemed to regret that the State government was not a more numerous\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nThe day following had been designated for the public reception of the\r\nPresident and the members of his Cabinet in the Hall of the House of\r\nRepresentatives.  It followed that it was my official duty to deliver\r\nan address of welcome.  I prepared my address in which I made an\r\nallusion to the members of the Cabinet from other States, but strange,\r\nas it now appears, I made no allusion to Mr. Webster.  I gave the\r\naddress to the newspapers and it was not until eleven o'clock that I\r\nawoke to the fact of my neglect.  I prepared a paragraph and sent it\r\nto the papers in season for the afternoon edition.  Mr. Webster sat\r\non my left.  The President and the other members of the Cabinet were\r\non my right.  The President arose when I did and remained standing.\r\nWhen I alluded to Stuart and Conrad they gave no indication of their\r\npresence, but when I referred to Mr. Webster he rose at once and the\r\nHall resounded with the cheers of the audience.  Speeches in reply were\r\nmade by the President, by Mr. Webster, Mr. Stuart, and Mr. Conrad.\r\n\r\nAt the time Mr. Winthrop was the Whig candidate for Governor.  He was\r\npresent in the audience.  In the course of Mr. Webster's speech, he\r\ngave my administration an endorsement in these words:--\"I wish in the\r\nfirst place to say that from the bottom of my heart I wish entire\r\nsuccess to your administration of the affairs of this State.  Into\r\nwhosoever hands these affairs may fall, if they are fairly and\r\nimpartially administered, those hands shall have my hand in their\r\nsupport, and maintenance.\"  These words were received by the audience\r\nand the people of the State as a more full endorsement of my\r\nadministration then the printed text justified.  They gave Mr. Winthrop\r\nand his friends much uneasiness and it is quite likely that they\r\ncontributed to Mr. Winthrop's defeat and to my re-election.  In the\r\ncourse of his speech Mr. Webster used these words speaking of the\r\npeople of Massachusetts:  \"And yet all are full of happiness, and all\r\nare, as we say in the country, well-to-do in the world and enjoying\r\nneighbor's fare.\"  This phrase puzzled me, but at length I reached\r\nthe conclusion, that the people were living so well that they could\r\ninvite a neighbor who called without notice to take a seat at table\r\nwithout making any change.  In other words, that the daily fare of the\r\npeople was good enough for the neighbors.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1851 a meeting was called in aid of Smith O'Brien and\r\nhis associates, who then were in banishment at Van Diemen's Land.  Of\r\nthe project for the meeting I knew nothing until I received a call from\r\na committee of Irishmen asking me to preside.  I saw no reason for\r\ndeclining, and I therefore accepted the invitation, and without any\r\nthought of its significance in politics.  It was said afterwards that\r\nthe meeting had been promoted by the friends of Mr. Winthrop, with the\r\nexpectation that he would be invited to preside.  Upon the vote in\r\ncommittee, the invitation came to me, by a majority of one vote only.\r\nThe meeting was a great success, and probably it gave me some votes\r\namong the Irish population.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\nACTON MONUMENT\r\n\r\nWhile I held the office of Governor, two memorial events occurred, of\r\nsome importance.  The first was the erection and dedication of a\r\nmonument in the town of Acton, to the memory of Captain Isaac Davis,\r\nand two others, who were killed the 19th of April, 1775, at the Old\r\nNorth Bridge in Concord.  A feud had existed for many years between the\r\ntowns of Concord and Acton each claiming the honors of the battlefield\r\non that date.  Of Concord it was alleged that not a drop of blood was\r\nlost on the occasion.  Recently, however, it is claimed that one man\r\nwas wounded.  As to Acton there was no doubt that Captain Davis with\r\nhis company was assigned to the right of the line, and to the head of\r\nthe advancing column, although he was not by seniority entitled to\r\nthat place.  Davis and two of his company were killed by the first fire\r\nof the enemy.  In 1836 Concord had erected a monument which Emerson\r\nhas immortalized in his dedication hymn.  James T. Woodbury, a brother\r\nof Judge Levi Woodbury, was an orthodox minister settled in Acton.  He\r\nwas interested in politics, and in the year 1851 he was a member of the\r\nHouse of Representatives, where he championed the cause of Acton.  He\r\nasked for an appropriation of one thousand dollars to enable the town\r\nto erect a suitable monument.  He adorned his speech and gave effect to\r\nhis oratory by the introduction of the shoe-buckles which Davis wore,\r\nand the powder horn which another of the victims carried on the day of\r\nthe fight.  The appropriation was granted.  The preceding year the town\r\nof Concord had celebrated the seventy-fifth anniversary of the battle.\r\nRobert Rantoul, Jr., delivered the oration.  The town of Acton was\r\nrepresented, but the president of the day, the Hon. E. R. Hoar, chose,\r\nas it was said, to avoid calling upon Parson Woodbury, as he was then\r\ndesignated.  A Mr. Hayward, a man of some note, but not gifted in\r\nspeech, was invited to respond to the toast to Acton.  That he did in\r\nthis manner:  \"Concord Fight.  Concord furnished the ground, and Acton\r\nthe men.\"  This sally of history and sarcasm was attributed to Parson\r\nWoodbury.\r\n\r\nThe Governor was made a member of the committee to erect the monument.\r\nOur first real difficulty was upon the inscription.  It was claimed\r\nthat Davis had said as he took his place at the head of the line \"I\r\nhaven't a man who is afraid to go.\"  This indicated that cowardice had\r\nbeen manifested in some quarter.  Woodbury insisted that this\r\nexpression should be included in the inscription.  I was opposed to its\r\nuse on account of the implication it contained, and also for the reason\r\nthat it was no easy matter to incorporate it in a sentence that would\r\nbe tolerable upon granite.  Mr. Woodbury wrote two inscriptions.\r\nGeneral Cushing tried his hand.  I prepared one or two.  Finally\r\nWoodbury triumphed, and the monument bears the words attributed to\r\nDavis.  I was invited to deliver the address at the dedication, October\r\n29, 1851, and the Rev. John Pierpont was invited to deliver the poem.\r\nThe exercises were in a large tent capable of seating a thousand\r\npersons at dinner.  The day was dull but the attendance was large.  The\r\nsoldiers were on duty at an early hour, and they were ready for dinner\r\nwhen they entered the tent at about eleven o'clock.  The tables were\r\nspread and the soldiers and guests took their seats at the tables, but\r\nunder an injunction that the repast would not begin until the address\r\nand poem had been delivered.  Fortunately the address came first.  The\r\ndelivery occupied an hour or more.  Mr. Pierpont commenced reading his\r\npoem, but before he had made any considerable progress, a slight\r\nclicking of knives was heard from the extreme portion of the tent.  Mr.\r\nPierpont was an excitable man.  He had a reputation as a preacher,\r\nlecturer and poet.  It was apparent from his flushed face that his\r\npride was wounded.  I expected that Mr. Woodbury, who was president of\r\nthe day, would rise and ask the guests to abstain from eating until\r\nMr. Pierpont had finished reading his poem.  The parson gave no sign,\r\nhowever.  The disturbance increased, and finally, Mr. Pierpont, with\r\nface flushed to purple, threw down his manuscript under the box from\r\nwhich he was reading, and sat down.  I then expected that the president\r\nwould demand order.  On the contrary, he stuck his hands straight into\r\nthe air, and said:  \"Let us ask a blessing.\"  This he did with singular\r\nbrevity, and sitting down he helped himself from a plate of chicken\r\nthat stood before him, and at the same time turning to Mr. Pierpont he\r\nsaid:  \"The listened very well, 'till you got to Greece.  They didn't\r\ncare anything about Greece.\"\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of my address I found from the records that the town\r\nof Acton had as early as the year 1774 declared, by resolution in town\r\nmeeting, in favor of an American Republic, adding:  \"This is the only\r\nform of government we wish to see established.\"  Upon my own\r\ninvestigation and upon the opinion of Mr. Webster, whom I consulted,\r\nI ventured to say that this was the earliest declaration in favor of a\r\nrepublic that was officially made in the American colonies.\r\n\r\nMy address ran as follows:\r\n\r\nADDRESS ON THE ACTON MONUMENT\r\n\r\nThe events of the American Revolution can never fail to interest\r\nAmericans.  This assemblage, men of Middlesex, is an assurance that\r\nyou cherish the Revolutionary character of your county, and that you\r\nwill be true to the obligations and duties which it imposes.\r\n\r\nThe event we commemorate is not of local interest only.  It has,\r\nhowever, little value on account of the number of men who fought or\r\nfell; but it lives as the opening scene of a great revolution based\r\non principle, and destined to change the character of human\r\ngovernments and the condition of the human race.  The 19th of April,\r\n1775, is not immortal because men fell in battle, but because they\r\nfell choosing death rather than servitude.  The mere soldier who fights\r\nwithout a cause is unworthy our respect, but he who falls in defence\r\nof sound principles or valued rights deserves a nation's gratitude.\r\nHence the battlefields of the Revolution shall gain new lustre, while\r\nAusterlitz and Waterloo shall be dimmed by the lapse of ages.  Each\r\nnation cherishes and recurs to the leading events in its history.\r\nTime increases the importance of some of them and diminishes the\r\nmagnitude of others.  Many of them are eras in the history of countries\r\nand the world.  Such are the lives of great men--philosophers, poets,\r\norators, and statesmen.  Such are battles and conquests, the foundation\r\nof new empires and the fall of old ones, changes in governments, and\r\nthe administrations of renowned monarchs.  Such were the conquest of\r\nGreece, the division of the Macedonian empire, the rise and fall of\r\nRome, the discovery and settlement of this continent, the English\r\ncommonwealth, the accession of William and Mary to the British throne,\r\nthe American Revolution, and, finally the wars, empire, and overthrow\r\nof Napoleon.  A knowledge of these events is not only valuable in\r\nitself, but it enables us to penetrate the darkness which usually\r\nobscures the daily life and character of a people.  A true view of the\r\nlife of Socrates gives us an accurate idea of Athens and the Athenian\r\npeople.  The protectorate of Cromwell, the great event in all English\r\nhistory, presents a view of the British nation while passing from an\r\nabsolute government to a limited monarchy, slowly but certainly tending\r\nto republicanism.\r\n\r\nThe American Revolution was a clear indication in itself of what the\r\ncolonies had been, and what the republic was destined to be.  Had the\r\nRevolution been delayed, no history, however minute, could have given\r\nto the world as accurate knowledge of the colonists from 1770 to 1780\r\nas it now possesses.  It was the full development of all their history;\r\nit was the concise, vigorous, intelligible introduction to their\r\nfuture.  It was a great illustration of pre-existing American\r\ncharacter.  Neither religious nor political fanaticism was an element\r\nof the American Revolution.  It was altogether defensive--defensive\r\nin its assertion of principles--defensive in its warlike operations.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the Revolution was an important step towards freedom\r\nand equality, but the Revolutionists did not primarily contemplate the\r\ndestruction or abandonment of the principles of the British government,\r\nbut rather their preservation and perpetuity; and this in a great\r\ndegree they accomplished.  The two governments are dissimilar in many\r\nrespects, but the principles which lie at the foundation of the one led\r\nto the formation of the other.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution was conservative.  There was always a strong desire in\r\nthe American mind to preserve, perpetuate, and improve existing\r\ninstitutions.  Our fathers were not the enemies of government.  They\r\nwere ready at all times to sustain a government founded upon and\r\nrecognizing the principles of equality and justice.  Nor did they\r\nimagine that society could exist without the agency of a government in\r\nwhich force should be an element.  In the early part of the struggle,\r\nwhile they denounced the policy of the British Ministry, they gave to\r\nthe principles of the British system an unequivocal support.  Many\r\nlooked only to a reproduction of the home government upon these shores,\r\nbut that was as impossible as the continuance of English authority.\r\n\r\nIt is vain to search for the particular cause, or even occasion, of the\r\nRevolution.  It is not contained in any act of Parliament, or\r\ndeclaration of rights, or assertion of authority.  The truth is, the\r\ncolonies had reached that point of conscious strength when they must\r\nbecome an integral part of the British Empire, or be separated entirely\r\nfrom it.  If there ever had been, there was no longer a feeling of\r\ndependence:  they were capable of self-support and protection.  There\r\ncould be no allegiance except upon principles of equality--and this\r\nEngland refused.  The connection was unnatural and burdensome--the\r\nseparation was natural and beneficial.  It is not a declaration of the\r\nlaw alone which limits the control of the father over the son, but in\r\nthe order of nature there is a time when the son is capable of self-\r\njudgment, and thereafter as regards rights they are on terms of\r\nequality, and all civil and social arrangements proceed upon that\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nBut had Great Britain proposed union in 1775 to us, as in 1800 she did\r\nto Ireland, the obstacles were so serious that a separation must\r\nultimately have taken place.  One was the breadth of ocean between the\r\ntwo parts of the empire--then, and for sixty years, a more serious\r\nobstacle than at present.  Another was the peerage--a part of the\r\nBritish system which could not have been abolished without the\r\noverthrow of the government, and yet incapable of introduction here.\r\nThe proposition would have shocked the moral sentiment and the\r\npolitical principles of the whole people.  And finally, our growing\r\ncommerce, uneasy under monopolizing restraints and rival domination,\r\ndemanded the freedom of the sea.  Therefore it is evident that a union\r\ncould not have been formed with any hope of permanence and power.  Nor\r\ncould the separation have taken place at a more fortunate time.  The\r\nwhole world would have had cause to regret our participation in the\r\nwars of Napoleon, and from them we were saved by independence.\r\n\r\nAlthough the existence of these natural sources of alienation and\r\ndisunion must be admitted, they furnish no justification for the\r\ngeneral policy of England--first negligent, then jealous, then\r\noppressive, and finally reckless and sanguinary.\r\n\r\nBut we have come together from our various pursuits to contemplate the\r\nvirtue and power of the American Revolution in itself and in its\r\nconsequences, to show that the sentiment of gratitude is not dead\r\nwithin us--and finally, and above all, to thank God for the choice\r\ndisplays of His goodness to the American people.\r\n\r\nThere are men who deny the virtue of the Revolution.  They do it in\r\nobedience to the doctrine that all wars are wrong.  But those only can\r\nconsistently maintain this doctrine who also maintain that all\r\ngovernments are wrong.  The idea of government includes the idea that\r\nthere are governing and governed parties to it.  In this country the\r\ntwo are united.  But all governments which have ever existed, including\r\nour own, make war upon those who forcibly question their authority,\r\nundermine their power, violate their laws, outrage the persons or\r\nproperty of their citizens.  These are acts of hostility against a\r\nstate, and are prevented or redressed by force--the element of war.\r\nTherefore, in principle, the daily operations of a government in time\r\nof peace are not to be distinguished from its movements in war; and in\r\nwar as well as in peace each government is responsible for the manner\r\nin which it exercises its authority.\r\n\r\nIf we may employ force in support of good government, we may also\r\nemploy force in the overthrow of a bad government.  If we may forcibly\r\ndefend a natural right, we may employ force to regain natural rights\r\nof which we have been disseized.  It is admitted amongst us that of all\r\nwars the Revolution is the most easily to be defended; but I desire to\r\nsee it occupy the high moral ground which the most paternal and\r\nbeneficial government occupies when it defends the natural and\r\ninalienable rights of its citizens.\r\n\r\nThe real question was this:  Who may of right govern the North American\r\ncolonies? the colonists themselves, or the Parliament of Great Britain?\r\nIn the colonies there was no difference of opinion upon this point,\r\nthough there was some as to the mode of securing its exercise.  If,\r\nthen, the right of self-government were in the colonists, did they use\r\nall proper means of securing its exercise previous to a resort to\r\narms?  They spent ten years in the work of petition, remonstrance and\r\nexpostulation--and those ten years of experience convinced the people\r\nthat the policy of the British Ministry and Parliament was fixed and\r\nirreversible; that there was only resistance to the execution of this\r\npolicy on the one hand, and submission, which must end in abject\r\nslavery, on the other.  If the American Revolution be morally\r\nindefensible, then not only are all wars indefensible, but all human\r\ngovernments, the wisest and the best, equally so.\r\n\r\nThe sentiment of the Revolution was altogether moral.  There was an\r\nentire absence of the spirit of revenge, or rapine, or blood.  They\r\nnever for a moment placed as much reliance upon their numbers and\r\nstrength as upon the justice of their cause and the existence of a\r\nSupreme Ruler, who controls the affairs of men.  Such was the tone of\r\nthe press, the pulpit and the bar.  Everywhere the morality of the\r\ncontest was examined and the ground carefully tested at each step.  Not\r\nby leading men only, but by all those who had a vote to give in a\r\ntown meeting or an arm to sustain the weapons of war.  They were no\r\nzealots, like the crusaders; but plain, careful men, of sound moral\r\nprinciples and correct judgment.  It is true that they were descendants\r\nof those who rejoiced when Charles the First was beheaded and James the\r\nSecond was dethroned.  This feeling, however, had no mixture of cruelty\r\nin it, but it proceeded from a conviction that those monarchs were\r\nunworthy of the throne.  Their impulses were always in favor of\r\nliberty.  They sympathized with the members of the Republican Party in\r\nEngland, encouraged them at home, and welcomed them to these shores.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution was no sudden outbreak or the consummation of the wild\r\nenthusiasm which sometimes characterizes popular movements.  All\r\nthrough our colonial and provincial history, questions had arisen and\r\nbeen discussed which prepared the public mind for independence.  The\r\nstrength of the revolutionary spirit in the different colonies bore a\r\ndistinct relation to the fervor of the preceding local controversies.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to say at what moment the public mind was steadily\r\ndirected to independence, either as a possible or desirable termination\r\nof the controversies with the mother country.  Both the war with France\r\nand the peace with France precipitated the American Revolution.  The\r\nwar, by developing the military courage and skill of our people, and\r\nby increasing the burdens of Great Britain, thus affording a pretext\r\nfor additional taxation on America.  The peace, by relieving the\r\ncolonies of the presence of a foe which they dreaded on its own\r\naccount, as well as for its active agency in stimulating the Indians to\r\ndeeds of hostility.  Thus, in fact, England exchanged the thirteen\r\ncolonies to which she was allied by blood, language, and similarity of\r\ninstitutions, for the provinces of France, whose people even now reject\r\nher religion and system of government.  Thus the success of the\r\ncombined British and American forces in the French war developed the\r\nrevolutionary spirit, created new issues, and led to the early\r\ndismemberment of the British Empire.\r\n\r\nBut omitting the settlement of the country and the causes which led to\r\nit, there are incident all along our history which weakened the power\r\nof the home government.  The most important, perhaps, were the decree\r\nin chancery of 1684, which annulled the colonial charter, and the grant\r\nof a new charter in 1692 by William and Mary.  The first was an act of\r\nunmitigated despotism, the second of short-sighted selfishness.  The\r\ndecree in chancery was accepted, because the colonists had no hope of\r\nanything better.  Thus the character of the government was changed\r\nfundamentally without the consent of the governed.  The arrow aimed at\r\ncolonial independence rankled in the public breast until the\r\nindependence of America was achieved.  The effort to strengthen\r\nBritish authority, in reality weakened it.  Previous to 1684 religious\r\nprofession was the basis of political rights, and the clergy gave\r\ndirection to the policy of the state.  John Cotton well states the\r\nresult of the colony charter, to wit:  \"Such a form of government, as\r\nbest serveth to establish their religion, should, by the consent of\r\nall, be established in the civil state. . . . The effect of this\r\nconstitution was, first, that none but members of the church were\r\nfreemen of the state; secondly, as none could be church members whom\r\nthe minister did not approve, it followed that the ecclesiastical ruler\r\nhad an efficient negative on the admission of every freeman; and\r\nthereby, as excommunication from the church created a civil, as well as\r\necclesiastical disability, it also followed that both the attainment\r\nand continuance of political rights were, to all practical purposes, in\r\nthe hands of ecclesiastical rulers.\"  By the provincial charter all\r\nthis was abolished.  The new government had exclusively for its end\r\n\"the things about which the civil power is usually conversant; goods,\r\nlands, honors, the liberties and peace of the outward man.\"  The\r\ninfluence of the clergy, at all times very great in New England, was\r\nthus separated from the English government, and they were at once\r\nidentified in sympathy, hopes, and prospects, with the people of the\r\ncolony.  As I shall have occasion hereafter to say, this influence was\r\nessential to the success of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nIt is not likely that any form of government which Great Britain could\r\nhave established, especially if it excluded our people from its\r\ncontrol, could have maintained the union twenty-five years longer than\r\nthe relation actually existed.  The future in some particulars was as\r\nfull of hope then to them as it is now to us.  Many of their\r\nanticipations were so sanguine that the reality has not been equal to\r\nthem.  In 1763 an estimate was made that the population of New England\r\nin 1835 would be 4,000,000.  From this it is apparent that they had\r\nalready tasted prosperity and had come to understand the advantages of\r\nour country, especially in the character of its population, over the\r\nold countries of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe British Ministry did not discover the means by which the colonies\r\nwere to be retained, if retained at all.  Our ancestors had little\r\nrespect for hereditary privileges and the pretensions of birth.  They\r\nwere for the most part believers in the equality of the human race;\r\nand, moreover, in their municipal governments, they had learned the\r\nsafety and power of universal suffrage.  A few men only in England had\r\nan accurate idea of American principles, or the difficulty of holding\r\nin unwilling embrace three million people.  Among the representatives\r\nof this small class were the elder Pitt, Burke, and Wilkes.\r\n\r\nPitt declared that \"three million people, so dead to all the feelings\r\nof liberty as voluntarily to submit to be slaves, would have been fit\r\ninstruments to make slaves of ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nSaid Wilkes, \"Know, then, that a successful resistance is a revolution,\r\nnot a rebellion.  Who can tell whether in a few years the independent\r\nAmericans may not celebrate the glorious era of the revolution of 1775\r\nas we do that of 1688?\"  Nor did his prophetic eye fail to penetrate\r\neven the distant future.  \"Where your fleets and armies are stationed,\"\r\nsaid he, \"the possession will be secured, while they continue; but all\r\nthe rest will be lost.  In the great scale of empire, you will decline,\r\nI fear, from the decision of this day; and the Americans will rise to\r\nindependence, to power, to all the greatness of the most renowned\r\nstates; for _they build on the solid basis of general public liberty.\"_\r\nThese were words of wisdom; but nations, like individual men, learn\r\nanything sooner than their own faults, and confess anything sooner than\r\ntheir own mistakes.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for the historian to understand the policy of\r\nattempting to control America by force; for nothing is more certain\r\nthan that, if we had failed in establishing our independence, Great\r\nBritain would also have failed in subjecting us to her schemes.\r\nAfter the shedding of blood at Lexington, reconciliation was\r\nimpossible; nor is it certain that it could have been accomplished\r\nafter the massacre in King Street, in 1770.  To be sure the proceedings\r\nof the towns and the tone of all the memorials and petitions indicate\r\nthis; but there were unquestionably men who thought it better that the\r\nconnection should be dissolved at as early a period as possible.  These\r\nmen were right, both as regards our condition and the prosperity of\r\nEngland.  Had we remained her subjects, like all colonies, we should\r\nhave been of no advantage pecuniarily, and most likely a source of\r\nsome expense.  But with independence and the Constitution came\r\nprosperity to us, in which, through trade and the increased demand for\r\nher manufactures, England has largely participated.\r\n\r\nHad she consented, in 1775, to the peaceful dismemberment of her\r\nempire, the independence of America, under such circumstances, would\r\nhave increased her glory, spared her treasury, and saved her laborers\r\nform the pressure of taxes under which they have been weighed down.  It\r\nmay be, however, that the war was necessary to us.  In ante-\r\nRevolutionary times there was not a strong tendency to union--in many\r\nparts of the country the opposite feeling existed.  Even the\r\nConstitution was framed with difficulty, and received with hesitation\r\nand doubt.  The Constitution is not so much the result as the cause\r\nof our national character.  The colonies had had different foundations.\r\nSome were English, some were Dutch, some were Roundheads, some\r\nCavaliers, some were Catholics, some Protestants, some Baptists, some\r\nQuakers, some Congregationalists; and, finally, some of the colonies\r\nwere free and some held slaves.  It is apparent that there was not\r\nthat tendency to union which was necessary to the formation of the\r\nConstitution.  But the mutual dependence which the mutual necessities\r\nof the war produced convinced many of the propriety of a common\r\ngovernment--a government which should be adequate to a time of peace\r\nand to a condition of war--a government which should guard each State\r\nfrom civil commotion and protect its citizens and commerce in every\r\npart of the world.  It is evident that the free surrender of\r\njurisdiction would have left the colonies to many years of separate\r\nexistence, and controversies which might have passed into open\r\nhostility.  The period between peace and the adoption of the\r\nConstitution was hardly more desirable than the previous condition of\r\nwar.  The currency was disordered and without value, the revenue\r\nsystems of the different States were various and injurious to\r\nlegitimate commerce, while the want of uniform laws upon subjects\r\naltogether national, was everywhere observed.  A general government,\r\nadequate to the necessities of the nation, was not established until\r\nthe inadequacy of the State governments had been felt in peace and\r\nwar; but war more than peace created bonds of sympathy, and inspired\r\nconfidence among the States.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution opened in Massachusetts.  This province having been\r\nmarked by the British Government, was not at all reluctant to take a\r\nprominent position in the controversies from 1765 to 1775.  Therefore\r\nthe attack was properly directed here, and here with equal propriety\r\nthe first forcible resistance was made to British aggression.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties with Massachusetts were a century old.  The colony\r\ncharter had been annulled--her territory on the Merrimack and the\r\nNarragansett had been transferred to neighboring colonies, and the men\r\nwhom she had elected to preside in her House of Representatives had\r\nbeen repeatedly rejected.\r\n\r\nThere had been from the first an ardent desire in the colony to\r\nestablish a free Christian commonwealth, and on the part of England to\r\nmaintain, if not extend, the power of the British Parliament.  In May,\r\n1774, as the representative of the latter purpose, General Gage arrived\r\nin Boston, and was soon followed by considerable bodies of troops.  In\r\nAugust of the same year measures were taken for a Provincial Congress,\r\nto concert and execute an effectual plan for counteracting the system\r\nof despotism which had been introduced.  The Congress instructed the\r\ngeneral officers \"effectually to oppose and resist\" all attempts to\r\nexecute the obnoxious acts of the British Parliament; and by a singular\r\ncoincidence on the same day, February 9, 1775, the Parliament pledged\r\nthe lives and property of the Commons to the support of those laws.\r\nOn the side of the Americans, the courts were declared unconstitutional\r\nand their officers traitors--and the practice of the military art was\r\nearnestly recommended.\r\n\r\nBy the 1st of September, 1774, the issue was fairly presented.  The\r\nclaim on one side was the supremacy of the British Parliament, and on\r\nthe other the supremacy of the American people.  Parliament claimed the\r\nright to legislate for or over the colonies in all cases whatsoever;\r\nthis right the colonists denied.  Parliament had asserted its supremacy\r\nby the passage, in May, 1774, of \"An act for the better regulating the\r\ngovernment of the province of Massachusetts Bay,\" and \"An act for the\r\nmore impartial administration of justice in said province.\"  Submission\r\nto these acts was the test.  They would not execute themselves.  Their\r\nprecise character was of no great importance to the people.  It was a\r\nquestion of right, of authority, and not of detail.  Had the acts been\r\nless oppressive, or even more so, the principle at issue would not have\r\nbeen changed.  In August, 1774, one hundred and fifty of the best men\r\nof Middlesex assembled in the adjacent town of Concord, and uttered\r\nthese memorable words:\r\n\r\n\"We are obliged to say, however painful it may be to us, that the\r\nquestion now is, whether by a submission to some of the late acts\r\nof the Parliament of Great Britain, we are contented to be the most\r\nabject slaves, and entail that slavery on posterity after us, or, by\r\na manly, joint and virtuous opposition, assert and support our freedom.\r\nThere is a mode of conduct which, in our very critical circumstances\r\nwe wish to adopt--a conduct, on the one hand, never tamely submissive\r\nto tyranny and oppression; on the other, never degenerating into rage,\r\npassion and confusion.\"  Again, \"We must now exert ourselves, or all\r\nthose efforts which for ten years past have brightened the annals of\r\nthis country, will be totally frustrated.  Life and Death, or what is\r\nmore, Freedom and Slavery, are in a peculiar sense now before us; and\r\nthat choice and success, under God, depend greatly on ourselves.  We\r\nare therefore bound, as struggling not only for ourselves, but for\r\nfuture generations, to express our sentiments in the following resolves\r\n--sentiments which we think are founded in truth and justice, and\r\ntherefore sentiments we are determined to abide by.\"  In conclusion\r\nthey say \"no danger shall affright, no difficulties intimidate us; and\r\nif, in support of our rights, we are called to encounter even death,\r\nwe are yet undaunted, sensible that he can never die too soon who lays\r\ndown his life in support of the laws and liberties of his country.\"\r\n\r\nIf we for a moment forget the territorial and popular influence which\r\nbelongs to the action of sovereign States and large masses of men, we\r\nshall see no material difference between this language and that of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence.  It was a pledge of life to the support\r\nof the laws and liberties of the land.  It was at once a concise and\r\nforcible review of the past; a just and eloquent defence of the\r\nprinciples and conduct of the colony; a noble appeal in behalf of\r\nthat and future generations.  Memorable words for men to utter who\r\nled at Lexington, Concord and Bunker Hill!\r\n\r\nJames Prescott, of Groton, was chairman of the convention, and\r\nFrances Faulkner, John Hayward and Ephraim Hapgood were members from\r\nthe town of Acton.  This was the most important step taken prior to\r\nthe commencement of hostilities.  The convention attracted universal\r\nnotice.  Copies of its proceedings were sent to the Continental\r\nCongress, then sitting at Philadelphia, and they received cordial\r\napprobation.  But even as late as September, 1774, the patriots say to\r\nGeneral Gage, \"that their sole intention is to preserve pure and\r\ninviolate those rights to which, as men, and English Americans, they\r\nare justly entitled, and which have been guaranteed to them by his\r\nmajesty's royal predecessors.\"  Thus anxious were they at every point\r\nof the controversy to define the ground on which they stood.\r\n\r\nFrom August, 1774, to February, 1775, the British were engaged in\r\nexaminations of the country, in landing and drilling the troops,\r\nand in vain attempts to check the progress or expression of the\r\npublic sentiment of almost universal hostility.\r\n\r\nThe province was engaged in the organization and discipline of the\r\nminute men, and the collection and safe-keeping of stores, arms, and\r\nmunitions of war; preparations for attack on the one side, and\r\npreparations for defence on the other.  Nevertheless, this was a\r\nseason for reflection.  For six months after the issue was fairly\r\npresented, there were no evidences of fear, and but few indications of\r\na disposition to conciliate.\r\n\r\nGeneral Gage, however, appears not to have entertained the common\r\nnotion of English officers, that a small body of troops would put down\r\nall opposition.  He informed his government that the time for\r\n\"conciliation, moderation, reasoning was over,\" and that the first\r\ncampaign should be opened by the presence of twenty thousand men.  This\r\nwas wise advice, because it was such advice as a wise man would have\r\ngiven under the circumstances.  It was, however, a fortunate blunder\r\nin the English Government that they rejected it.  They held Boston with\r\nthe army they sent, and with a larger army they could have done nothing\r\nmore.  They might have made more frequent and more sanguinary forays\r\ninto the country, but the result of the campaign would have been the\r\nsame.  It was neither possible nor politic for the Americans in the\r\nRevolution to assemble large bodies of troops; therefore, the presence\r\nof twenty, or even fifty, thousand men, would not have been a matter\r\nof great importance to the colonies.\r\n\r\nEngland held us in 1775, as she holds many of her provinces now--by\r\ntheir own consent, but not otherwise.  That consent can be perpetual\r\nonly by the recognition of the principles of freedom and equality.  The\r\ncause of liberty raises up friends and advocates everywhere.  None of\r\nits martyrs ever die unwept, unhonored or unsung.  The human heart has\r\nnever been truer to any principle than to that of liberty.  It is not\r\nin America alone that the cause of freedom excites sympathy and enlists\r\nsupport.  Its voice is as potential, its victories as grateful\r\nelsewhere as with us.  And when its banner is borne down and trampled\r\nin the dust, it is not in America alone that true hearts sympathize\r\nand bleed.  There are noble men in England, France, Germany, Italy, and\r\nHungary, upon whom the blow falls, as upon the first victims of\r\nslavery.  But in the wisdom of God, the nation that is not just shall\r\nstand finally\r\n\r\n  \"Childless and crownless in her voiceless woe,\r\n   An empty urn within her withered hands.\"\r\n\r\nAnd thus shall it be with Austria.  With the judgment of the civilized\r\nworld against her, with her people disaffected and disloyal, her\r\ntreasury drained and her credit destroyed, she shall wither and fall.\r\nThe partition of Poland, and the dispersion of the Poles all over\r\nEurope, have been active agencies in the revolutionary movements of\r\nthat continent.  Thus do the results of tyranny aid in the overthrow\r\nof tyrants.  No government can now be considered strong, whether it\r\ncall itself republican or monarchial, unless its foundations are laid\r\ndeep in the affections of the people, and based upon the immutable\r\nprinciples of justice and equality.\r\n\r\nIn 1775, England had been engaged a century in the work of disunion.\r\nIn a hundred years great changes may be wrought.  The affections of a\r\nwhole people may be diverted from former objects and attached to new\r\nones.  This was the great change which took place in America.  England\r\nhad ceased to be the _mother country._  The colonists had less regard\r\nfor her in 1774 and 1775 than we have now.  All fear and, I trust, all\r\nprejudice have disappeared, and we may look upon her as she is.\r\nHowever England may regard us, we need only view her as a splendid\r\nexample of a nation great and powerful by the productiveness of her\r\nsoil and mines, the ability of her people, and the liberalizing spirit\r\nof her commerce.  In her present external condition, in her vast navy,\r\nher extensive commerce, in all save her insulated and secure position,\r\nwe may read our own near destiny.  Grasping, ambitious and powerful the\r\nBritish race certainly is; illiberal, cowardly or mean it certainly is\r\nnot.  Highly refined it never was, possibly never will be.  Neither the\r\nocean nor the mountain produces the highest refinement of manners or\r\nnicety of scientific investigation; but the shores of the ocean and the\r\nmountain valleys are the birthplaces of great men.\r\n\r\n  \"Chains may subdue the feeble spirit, but thee,\r\n   Man of the iron heart, they could not tame;\r\n   For thou wert of the mountains, they proclaim\r\n   The everlasting creed of liberty.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of April, 1775, the first movement was made which really\r\nput in danger the lives and property of the inhabitants of\r\nMassachusetts.  Its destination was Concord--its object the destruction\r\nof the stores secreted there, and incidentally the seizure of\r\nobnoxious patriots who were members of the Provincial Congress, which\r\nhad then but recently adjourned.  It was a test movement in the\r\ncontroversy.  If the British could make incursions and seize the public\r\nproperty of the province then the colonies would be disarmed and\r\nwithout the means of resisting the offensive acts of May, 1774.  Hence\r\nthe protection of the stores was the question of resistance or\r\nsubmission to the claims of Parliament.\r\n\r\nYou know the story of the stealthy, midnight march from Boston,--the\r\nsuccessful mission to Adams and Hancock,--the sudden fear which\r\nseized Colonel Smith, the commander of the expedition,--his call for\r\nreinforcements before he knew whether the yeomanry would fight or not,\r\n--the massacre at Lexington,--the alarm of the country,--the gathering\r\nof the minute men,--the arrival of the foe at Concord,--the division\r\nof the invading party to secure the entrance to the town,--the\r\nengagement at the Old North Bridge, where the resolutions of the county\r\nof Middlesex of August, 1774, were embodied in action,--the confusion\r\nconsequent upon so serious a matter as resistance to the Parliament and\r\nMinistry of England,--the retreat of the invading party,--the hot\r\npursuit,--the final flight,--and the electric shock which the\r\nproceedings of April 19 gave to the colonies and to Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThese events were long and well remembered, and the historian cannot\r\nomit to give them importance in his view of the progress of liberty,\r\nand especially of American liberty.  But my respect for your\r\nfamiliarity with the opening, thrilling scenes of the Revolution\r\ncounsels me to omit the details, even when we remember those whose\r\nnames have been made illustrious by the parts they bore.  All shall\r\nlive upon the just page of our own historian.  But the interest which\r\nbelongs to the events of that day is not more on account of the\r\nimportant results of the war, than from the sense of duty under\r\nwhich the contest was commenced.  It was this conviction which made\r\nAmerican invincible.  It produced that singular and highest quality\r\nof martyrdom which endures more than the worst enemies can inflict.\r\nIt was this sense of duty which gave courage to our soldiers and\r\ninspired all our families with that charity and patriotism on which\r\nthe army was so dependent for clothing and the necessities of life.\r\nThe sentiment was almost universal that the colonies were oppressed,\r\nthat the policy of the mother country was in violation of its own\r\nprinciples of government, that the colonists were refused the rights\r\nand privileges of British subjects, and lastly that Great Britain was\r\ndetermined to introduce a commercial system purposely detrimental to\r\ncolonial interests; in fine, that commerce was to be paralyzed,\r\nmanufactures discouraged, and agriculture reduced to a state of\r\nvassalage.\r\n\r\nThe public attention had been for many years directed to the\r\npossibility of a rupture,--none knew when or how terrible it would be.\r\nThere had, however, been a long season of preparation.  The courage\r\nnecessary to meet the crisis was quite different from that which the\r\nmere soldier requires.\r\n\r\nIn 1775 our fathers were called upon to judge of the morality of the\r\ncourse they were entering, not for themselves only, but for their\r\ncountry and for posterity.\r\n\r\nThey commenced as rebels; whether their career should be that of\r\npatriots or traitors was in some degree uncertain.  But a high sense of\r\nduty overcame all obstacles and led them with a firm reliance on Divine\r\nProvidence to take the great step which must lead to freedom and honor\r\nor slavery and disgrace.\r\n\r\nActon had uniformly supported the policy of the colony, and early\r\npledged itself to the town of Boston in favor of non-importation and\r\nnon-consumption of foreign products.  It declared in strong language\r\nits hostility to all those who did not subscribe to the merchants'\r\nagreement; even to denying them personal notice and social\r\nconversation.  In November, 1774, a company of minute men was raised\r\nand placed under the command of Isaac Davis.  It contained the hope of\r\nthe town,--young men from sixteen to thirty years of age.  They were\r\nfrequently drilled at the public cost, and they acquired a good deal\r\nof discipline.  On the morning of the 19th of April the town of Acton\r\nwas alarmed by some unknown person who hurried rapidly on to more\r\ninterior points.  Early in the day Captain Davis with his company,\r\nenrolling about forty men, reached the northerly side of Concord River\r\nand took his proper position on the left of the line under command of\r\nColonel Barrett.  About a hundred British troops were near the bridge,\r\nbut they soon removed to the opposite side of the river.  Another small\r\nbody had gone to Colonel Barrett's in search of stores secreted there.\r\nBefore any blood was shed the officers of the provincial troops held a\r\ncouncil at which it appears to have been understood that Captain Davis\r\nshould take the right of the line.  Whether the change was made in\r\nconsequence of the superior equipment, or better discipline, or reputed\r\nvalor of the Acton men, there is no reason to doubt it was made, and\r\nmade with the consent, if not at the request, of the officers and\r\nprincipal men upon the ground.  But for whatever reason made, it was\r\nnone the less creditable to the command which at once assumed the post\r\nof honor and the position of danger.\r\n\r\nThe column was led by Major Buttrick, Colonel Robinson and Captain\r\nDavis.  Colonel Robinson was lieutenant-colonel of Prescott's regiment,\r\nand on this occasion he volunteered for no purpose but the\r\nencouragement of the men.  At the first general fire from the British,\r\nCaptain Davis and Abner Hosmer, a private in Davis' company, were\r\nkilled.  Almost instantly the fire was returned, and one British\r\nsoldier was killed and several were wounded.  The engagement was at an\r\nend.\r\n\r\nThe two parties seem to have been equally confused by the fight.  The\r\nProvincials manifested no fear, but the contest so long anticipated\r\nhad actually taken place,--blood had been shed,--men had fallen on\r\nboth sides.  The responsibility of the moment was very great.  In\r\ncontemplation of law they had resisted the British Ministry, they had\r\nattacked the British throne.\r\n\r\nThe regulars retired to the village, and, the divisions of troops\r\nhaving joined each other, they commenced a retreat which for several\r\nmiles was a precipitous flight.\r\n\r\nHayward fell mortally wounded at Lexington in a personal recontre with\r\na British soldier.  It was fatal to both, though Hayward survived\r\nseveral hours.  With a religious patriotism he assured his father that\r\nthe day's doings gave him no regret.\r\n\r\nPatriotism is one of the most exalted virtues.  It is not, as some\r\nwould have us believe, a mere excitement, or even a passion.  It is\r\nhigh among the virtues which men in this state of existence may\r\nexhibit.  Patriotism is not merely a barren attachment to the country\r\nin which we were born, nor is it that narrow yet holy feeling which\r\nleads us to look with affection upon the spot of our nativity,--upon\r\nthe hills over which we have roamed in childhood and youth; but a large\r\nand noble view of the entire nation,--a regard for its institutions,\r\nsocial, moral, civil and religious, crowned by a manly spirit which\r\nleads its possessor to peril all in their defence.  The patriot is\r\ndevoted and self-sacrificing.\r\n\r\nSuch were Davis, Hayward and Hosmer.  Their names were comparatively\r\nhumble, yet they were men of duty, men of religion, men of a liberal\r\npatriotism.  Davis was about thirty years of age.  He was both a\r\nhusband and a father.  He left his family that morning with a firm\r\nconviction that he should see them no more.  If his lip quivered and\r\nhis eye moistened as he trod his own freehold for the last time, fear\r\nhad no part in those emotions.  He had not accepted a command and\r\ntrained his men for months without having anticipated the actual\r\ncondition of war which was then immediately before him.\r\n\r\nHayward and Hosmer were both sons of deacons in the church and were\r\nsent forth that morning upon an errand of death with the paternal\r\nblessing.  Neither churches nor clergy were indifferent to the result.\r\nThe clergy had counseled resistance.  The people had imbibed with their\r\nreligious opinions and sentiments a deep hatred of oppression.  The\r\nthree who fell were young men and well educated for the age in which\r\nthey lived.  They were of the yeomanry.  They did not serve on that\r\nday upon compulsion nor for mercenary motives.  They were the servants\r\nof the province; they were martyrs in the cause of freedom.\r\n\r\n  \"Their names mankind shall hold\r\n   In deep remembrance, and their memory shall be\r\n   A lasting monument, a sacred shrine\r\n   Of those who died for righteousness and truth.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Robinson was a native of the county of Essex, but then a\r\ncitizen of Westford.  In 1775 he was forty years of age, a veteran of\r\nthe French War, and at the time of his death in 1805 he had been\r\nengaged in nineteen battles.  Of his courage there was no doubt.\r\nThaxter says of him, \"a braver and more upright man I never knew.\"  At\r\nBunker Hill he served under Prescott, who pronounced him both honorable\r\nand brave.\r\n\r\nHis epitaph claims for him the honor of commanding at Concord Bridge,\r\nbut the weight of evidence is in favor of Major Buttrick as the active\r\ncommander.  And Robinson's fame can well spare even so distinguished\r\nan honor as the command at the North Bridge.  The name of Major\r\nButtrick, with that of Captain Davis, was early consecrated by the\r\nLegislature of the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nFrom ten to twelve o'clock, of the morning of the 19th, there was a\r\ncessation of hostilities.  This respite was the natural result of the\r\npolicy and purposes of the two parties.  The Americans' great idea was\r\nresistance.  Whatever may be said to the contrary, the officers in\r\ncommand did not regard it within their line of duty to make an attack.\r\nThe instruction of the Provincial Congress were explicit to the\r\ncontrary.  It was deemed a great point to show that the British fired\r\nfirst.  But even admitting the purpose of the Americans to make an\r\nattack, the village of Concord was most unfavorable.  The British\r\nwould have had the advantage of position, and at any moment might have\r\ninflicted irreparable injury in the destruction of the town.  To\r\nwhatever reason the alleged apathy of the Americans during those two\r\nhours is attributable, it was most fortunate for the cause they\r\ndefended.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the invaders, it is quite certain, was a retreat to\r\nBoston rather than a renewal of hostilities at Concord.  The fierce\r\nand continued attack of the Americans during the afternoon was\r\ninduced by a knowledge of what had happened at Lexington, by the\r\npresence of large numbers of men, and possibly by the advice and\r\ncounsel of Adams and Hancock.\r\n\r\nOf Davis' company there were men among the survivors who deserve well\r\nof posterity.  Thomas Thorp was an apprentice in Acton, having been\r\ntaken from the alms-house of the town of Boston.  He not only served\r\nat Concord but during the war; and his love of country shone as bright\r\nin the evening as in the morning of his days.\r\n\r\nIn Massachusetts the revolution was carried on by towns.  These\r\norganizations were proof against all the attacks of the British\r\nGovernment.  For ten years previous to 1775, they had passed\r\nresolutions and taken the initiatory steps of resistance.  The\r\ncolonies were more cumbrous, and opinion when expressed was necessarily\r\nrepresentative.  Representatives may go beyond, or fall short of, the\r\nopinions of their principals, but the people themselves make no such\r\nmistakes.  A New England town meeting is the most perfect democracy\r\nwhich the world has ever seen.  Citizens are upon an equality.  Votes\r\nare not given on account of wealth, standing, or official position,\r\nbut as the primary, legitimate right of each citizen.  Even at the\r\ncommencement of the Revolution we had had great experience in voting.\r\nIt was not a questionable right.  At all times, even when valued rights\r\nof British subjects were invaded, that of voting had never been\r\nassailed.  Towns not only chose their selectmen and representatives,\r\nbut with great freedom they expressed opinions upon public affairs and\r\nthe conduct of public men, even to the King upon his throne.  They had\r\nvoted men and supplies in the French war, and in the Revolution they\r\ndid the same.  In this province the people were reached through the\r\ntowns almost exclusively.  They voluntarily assumed the burdens of the\r\nwar, and hence they had great influence in its prosecution.  It is a\r\nsingular and most agreeable fact that the Revolution was eminently a\r\npopular movement; and in proportion as we appreciate correctly the\r\nburdens of the war does our respect increase for the men who\r\nvoluntarily assumed them.  When the army was famishing, when the\r\nsoldiers were destitute of clothing, when men and money were needed,\r\nthe appeal was made to the towns, and in their meetings the subject\r\nwas considered and determined.  I know not of a more gratifying fact\r\nin the Revolution than this, and I may venture to say that it is one\r\nwhose importance has been sometimes overlooked.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of patriotic Boston was the spirit of every municipality\r\nin the province, and there is no instance of devotion superior to that\r\nmanifested by all when Boston was the special object of ministerial\r\nwrath.  Her injuries were felt by each town as though the blow were\r\naimed at its own independence and integrity.  And so in fact it was.\r\nBut had Boston even fallen there were still strongholds of rebellion\r\nthroughout the province, and the principles of the revolution would\r\nhave survived.\r\n\r\nNor did the towns cease their efforts when they had voted supplies for\r\nthe prosecution of the war.  They took part early in favor of\r\nindependence.  In every town men sprung up equal to the crisis which\r\nexisted.  Our local histories will bear to posterity resolutions as\r\nimmortal in sentiment and principle as the Declaration of Independence\r\nitself.  The resolutions of the neighboring towns of Concord express\r\nthe views of Massachusetts towns.  They say:  \"As men we have a right\r\nto life, liberty and property; as Christians, we in this land (blessed\r\nbe God for it) have a right to worship God according to the dictates\r\nof our own consciences; and as subjects we have a right to personal\r\nsecurity, personal liberty, and private property.  These principal\r\nrights we have as subjects of Great Britain; and no power on earth can\r\nagreeably to our constitution take them from us, or any part of them\r\nwithout our consent.\"  Where such principles existed the Declaration of\r\nIndependence was a necessity; therefore when it came, most of our towns\r\nwere prepared not only to accept it but to sustain it.  They readily\r\naffirmed in their own names the principles which had been declared, and\r\nassumed the responsibilities which had been taken by their\r\nrepresentatives in the Continental Congress.\r\n\r\nNor did their active agency in the cause of liberty and government\r\ncease here.  They declared the principles on which the State government\r\nought to be based and the manner of framing it.  The resolutions of\r\nActon and Concord are full and explicit on this point.  They deny the\r\nauthority of the Legislature to frame a constitution because, says the\r\ntown of Acton, \"a constitution properly framed has a system of\r\nprinciples established to secure the subjects in the possession of\r\ntheir rights and privileges, against any encroachments of the\r\nLegislative part; and it is our opinion that the same body that forms\r\na constitution, have, of consequence, a power to alter it; and we\r\nconceive, that a constitution, alterable by the supreme legislative\r\npower, is no security to the subjects, against the encroachments of\r\nthat power on our right and privileges.\"  And it was resolved, \"that\r\nthe town thinks it expedient that a convention be chosen by the\r\ninhabitants of the several towns and districts in this state, being\r\nfree to form and establish a constitution for this state.\"  The\r\nconstitution proposed by the Legislature was rejected by a vote of\r\nabout three to one.\r\n\r\nSimilar resolutions were passed by Concord, and the legislative\r\nconstitution was unanimously rejected.  But the town of Acton, early\r\nand alone, so far as I can ascertain, made a distinct declaration in\r\nfavor of an American Republic.  On the 14th of June, 1776, twenty days\r\nbefore the Declaration of Independence, the inhabitants declared \"that\r\nthe many injuries and unheard of barbarities, which the colonies have\r\nreceived from Great Britain, confirm us in the opinion, that the\r\npresent age will be deficient in their duty to God, their posterity\r\nand themselves, if they do not establish an American republic.  This\r\nis the only form of government we wish to see established.\"\r\n\r\nIt is true that the idea of a common government was somewhat general,\r\nbut not my any means universal even in Massachusetts, while Maryland\r\nhad not then declared herself in favor of independence.\r\n\r\nIt was a liberal, enlarged, progressive idea which looked from beneath\r\nthe lowering clouds of war, tyranny and hardship to the existence of an\r\nAmerican republic which should include at least all the territory\r\nwithin the jurisdiction of the thirteen colonies.  For even at a much\r\nlater period there were men of exalted attainments who doubted the\r\napplicability of the republican principle to large sections of\r\nterritory, and who would have sough in the division of the country, or\r\nin the establishment of what was then deemed a stronger government\r\nthat security which they did not expect in an American republic.\r\n\r\nThe revolution through the town governments had three principal points\r\nof support.  First, _popular intelligence;_ secondly, _the influence of\r\nthe clergy;_ thirdly, _the possession of land._\r\n\r\nThe age of the Revolution was an intelligent, thinking age.  It cannot\r\nbe considered as one of refinement, but there was a great deal of\r\noriginal, independent, manly, intellectual activity.  It was an age\r\nof great men, both in this country and England.  It could boast of the\r\nPitts, Burke, Fox and Sheridan; of Washington, Franklin, Jefferson, the\r\nAdamses, Patrick Henry and the Lees.  It was an age of useful\r\nintelligence, of eminent practical wisdom.  The leading minds of a\r\ncountry to some extent represent its general characteristics.  A\r\npopular sentiment which sustained with fidelity the measures of non-\r\nintercourse, of resistance and of war; which gave a generous,\r\naffectionate, intelligent support to the leaders of the Revolution,\r\nmust have been liberal, sagacious and honest.  The common-school system\r\nhad been in operation more than a century and a quarter, and under its\r\ninfluence the patriotism of the Revolution was highly intelligent.\r\n\r\nThe clergy generally were warm supporters of the war.  Most of them\r\nwere graduates of Harvard College, whose influence was always on the\r\npatriot side.  The influence of the clergy was very great in New\r\nEngland; hence the two most powerful springs of human action, religious\r\nand political enthusiasm, were blended in the breasts of our fathers.\r\nSome of the clergy, like Emerson of Concord, gave their personal\r\nservices to the American cause; while others, like Adams and Clark,\r\nmade the points in controversy with the mother country themes of\r\nreligious discourse.  The religion of Massachusetts was patriotic.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Zabdiel Adams, of Lunenburg, in a sermon preached during the\r\nwar, uttered these prophetic words:  \"To encourage us to persevere, let\r\nus anticipate the rising glory of America.  Behold her seas whitened\r\nwith commerce, her capitals filled with inhabitants, and resounding\r\nwith the din of industry.  See her rising to independence and glory.\r\nContemplate the respectable figure she will one day make among the\r\nnations of the earth; behold her venerable for wisdom, for counsel,\r\nfor might; flourishing in science, in agriculture and navigation, and\r\nin the arts of peace.  Figure to yourselves that this your native\r\ncountry will ere long become the permanent seat of liberty, the retreat\r\nof philosophers, the asylum of the oppressed, the umpire of contending\r\nnations, and we would hope the glory of Christ.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Revolution a large portion of the people were land-holders,--men\r\nwho answer to the old Saxon term yeoman.  Of course it is not possible\r\nfor every man to own land, nor is it essential that every man should be\r\na land-holder, yet it is evident that a community loses nothing by an\r\nincrease of proprietors.\r\n\r\nWhen a man owns land, even though his acres be not broad, he feels a\r\nnew interest in the welfare and freedom of the state.  The possession\r\nof land creates a certain and desirable independence.  Inducements\r\nshould therefore be held out to every branch of society, that the\r\nennobling idea of home may be realized in every bosom.  Even to this\r\nday our unoccupied lands are the storehouse of American freedom,--they\r\nare father's mansions to which every son of the Republic, be he\r\nprodigal or not, may turn his steps and find a welcome.\r\n\r\nAnd when our population shall have reached two hundred million, may\r\nthere still be beneath the flag of the Republic a home for the\r\noppressed and a refuge for the down-trodden.\r\n\r\nIn 1775 the spirit of emigration had not developed itself in the\r\nNew England character; it was latent until Wayne's victory in 1794\r\nprepared for our fathers the fertile lands and inviting climate of\r\nOhio.  The proportion of land-holders in Massachusetts was much\r\ngreater then than at present, though the absolute number is now quite\r\nequal to that of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\r\n\r\nIn all other countries the possession of land has been the element of\r\naristocracy; but with us it has been made subservient to the principles\r\nof republicanism.  And as an aristocracy cannot exist unless the land\r\nis aggregated in the hands of a few, so a republic cannot exist unless\r\nthe land is divided among the many.  There can be no doubt that the\r\ngreat proportion of land-holders was an element of strength in the\r\nRevolution.  Patriotism is defined as love of country,--and part of\r\nthat love proceeds from the fact that within and under the protection\r\nof our country is our home.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of April, 1775, the men of Acton left their homes upon\r\nthese hills, and their families anxious and disconsolate, that they\r\nand their descendants might have homes undisturbed by the hand of the\r\noppressor.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of April, 1775, these homes were deserted that all might\r\npay the last tribute of respect to Davis, Hayward and Hosmer.  And\r\nnow after the lapse of seventy-six years the descendants of that\r\ngeneration have met, not as then to mingle their tears at the grave\r\nof departed friends and heroes, but to utter with all of filial respect\r\nthe names of worthy men, and to impress with new power upon their\r\nhearts the sentiment of gratitude for all who served and suffered in\r\nthe cause of American freedom.  And as we contemplate the glorious\r\ndeath of those who fell, shall we not say,\r\n\r\n  \"Since all must life resign,\r\n   Those sweet reward which decorate the brave\r\n   'Tis folly to decline,\r\n   And steal inglorious to the silent grave.\"\r\n\r\nAs compared with the existence of the world only a short space of time\r\nhas intervened between the 19th of April, 1775, and this day, yet three\r\ngenerations of men have trodden these fields and aided in the great\r\nwork of perfecting and preserving American institutions.  With what\r\nconfidence, fellow citizens, did your ancestors look to independence\r\nand the establishment of the form of government under which we have\r\nlived and prospered as a people?  Beyond this form neither the patriot\r\nnor statesman can look with hope.\r\n\r\nWho will propose to the now united American people either a return to\r\nthe almost forgotten confederacy of 1778, or the establishment of\r\nseveral governments?  Nobody,--nobody.  When we contrast our\r\ninstitutions with those of any other country, how ought we to thank God\r\nfor the measure of personal happiness and political security we have\r\nenjoyed.\r\n\r\nNot that our institutions are perfect,--nor that there is nothing which\r\nthe philanthropist may deplore or the statesman condemn.  All the\r\nanticipations of our ancestors have not been realized.  The past is\r\nnot all perfect; the future will not always cheer us with sunshine and\r\nsmiles; but he is a misanthrope who allows his opinions to be\r\ncontrolled by the exceptions to the general current of our national\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\nOur years of independence have been years of almost uninterrupted\r\nprosperity, but they have borne to the grave those who took part in\r\nthe later as well as earlier contests of the Revolution.  Of Lexington\r\nand Concord, one only remains; and from all the battlefields of the\r\nwar this occasion has brought together but two.\r\n\r\nBut, fellow citizens, the few survivors are not only venerable, they\r\nare sacred men.  They are the last of a noble generation.  They\r\nperiled their lives in behalf of liberty, when\r\n\r\n  \"'Twas treason to love her and death to defend.\"\r\n\r\nFortunate all are you whose eyes rest to-day on these few surviving\r\nsoldiers of the Revolution.  Fortunate are the youth and children\r\nwho on this occasion and in this presence can pledge themselves to\r\nthe cause of constitutional liberty.  Of these men the next generation\r\nshall know only from history.  Fortune then that your lives began\r\nbefore theirs ended.\r\n\r\nThe patriot should do homage to these men, the statesman may sit at\r\ntheir feet and learn lessons of fidelity to principle, and citizens\r\nall may see how noble ends the life begun in the performance of duty.\r\n\r\nTo-day the commonwealth of Massachusetts and the town of Acton dedicate\r\nthis monument to the memory of the early martyrs of the Revolution, and\r\nconsecrate it to the principles of liberty and of patriotism.  Here its\r\nbase shall rest and its apex point to the heavens through the coming\r\ncenturies.  Though it bears the names of humble men, and commemorates\r\nservices stern rather than brilliant, it shall be as immortal as\r\nAmerican history.  The ground on which it stand shall be made classical\r\nby the deeds which it commemorates.  And may this monument exist only\r\nwith the existence of the republic; and when God in His wisdom shall\r\nbring this government to nought, as all human governments must come to\r\nnought, may no stone remain to point the inquirer to fields of valor or\r\nto remind him of deeds of glory.  And finally, may the republic\r\nresemble the sun in his daily circuit, so that none shall know whether\r\nits path were more glorious in the rising or in the setting.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\nSUDBURY MONUMENT\r\n\r\nAt the session of 1851 the Legislature made an appropriation of five\r\nhundred dollars to aid the town of Sudbury in building a memorial to\r\nCaptain Wadsworth and the men of his command who were cut off at\r\nSudbury in the year 1676 in the war known as King Philip's War.\r\n\r\nAs Governor I was made a member of the committee for the erection of a\r\nmonument.  The first subject was the style of the memorial.  The\r\nartists of Boston and vicinity sent designs and plans.  Some of these\r\nwere very attractive.  It happened, however, that a member of my\r\nCouncil, the Hon. Isaac Davis, of Worcester, had returned recently from\r\na visit to Europe.  He informed me that he had seen at Lucca in Italy,\r\na pyramidal structure which was considered the finest monument of its\r\nsort to be found in Europe.  I sent immediately for the proportions of\r\nthe pyramid and the Sudbury monument was modeled upon the same plan.  I\r\nam of the opinion that it fully justified the claim made in behalf of\r\nthe original.\r\n\r\nA serious difficulty occurred in regard to the inscription upon the\r\nSudbury monument.  The original slab was erected in the year 1692 by\r\nBenjamin Wadsworth, a son of Captain Wadsworth.  The son was then\r\nPresident Wadsworth of Harvard College.  The inscription stated that\r\nthe fight took place April 18, 1676.  In later times it was discovered\r\nthat two old almanacs, one kept by Minister Hobart of Hingham and one\r\nby Judge Sewall, contained entries of the fight _on the 21st of April,\r\n1676._  I examined the question and became satisfied that those entries\r\nwere made on the day when the intelligence was received by the writers.\r\nAccordingly I followed President Wadsworth as to the date.  The\r\n_Genealogical Register,_ under the charge of a Mr. Drake, in two\r\narticles criticized my inscription.  I replied in the _Register_ and\r\nended my article with a sentence which Drake struck out.  The sentence\r\nwas this:  _\"The testimony of President Wadsworth as to the time of his\r\nfather's death is of more value than all the theories of all the\r\ngenealogists who have existed since their vocation was so justly\r\ncondemned by St. Paul.\"_\r\n\r\nA few months later I appeared in the court to try a case which involved\r\nmy client's reputation for truth, and a thousand dollars in money.  To\r\nmy dismay I saw that Drake was foreman of the jury.  I lost my case,\r\nbut I think justly upon the evidence.  My principal witness failed to\r\nmake good upon the stand the statement that he had made to me in my\r\noffice.  One of the perils in the practice of law is that clients and\r\nclients' witnesses either make misstatements or fail to make full\r\nstatements of the facts.\r\n\r\nIn the middle-third part of the nineteenth century, the date of\r\nSudbury Fight was a topic of serious controversy by genealogists and\r\nhistorians.  I was responsible for the date that appears upon the\r\nmonument that was erected in the year 1852.  The conclusion that I had\r\nreached was condemned by the _Genealogical Register_ and by a committee\r\nof the Society.  In the year 1866 I reviewed the evidence, on which my\r\nopponents relied, and I marshaled the evidence in support of the\r\naccuracy of the date that appeared upon the monument.  In the year 1876\r\nthe town of Sudbury observed the bi-centennial on the 18th day of\r\nApril, thus giving sanction to the date on the monument.\r\n\r\nAt the dedication of the Sudbury monument I made the following address:\r\n\r\nADDRESS\r\n\r\nFamilies, races and nations of men appear, act their respective parts,\r\nand then pass away.  Political organizations are dissolved by influence\r\nof time.  At some periods and in some portions of the world, barbarous\r\nraces appropriate to their use the former domain of civilization, while\r\nat other points of time and space nations are rapidly advancing in\r\nwealth and refinement.  If savage communities have been exterminated by\r\nsuperior races of men, so have the arts and civilities of the most\r\nenlightened people been displaced by the rude passions and rugged\r\nmanners of barbarism.  As in the natural world there is a slow\r\nrevolution of thousands of years, by which every part of this globe is\r\nbrought within the tropics and beneath the poles, so there appears to\r\nbe a great cycle of humanity, whose law is that every portion of the\r\nrace shall pass through each condition of social, intellectual and\r\nmoral existence.\r\n\r\nBut whatever may be the fate of families, races and nations, their\r\ninfluence is in some sense perpetual.  The Past is not dead.  By a\r\nmysterious cord it is connected with the Present.  Could we analyze\r\nour life, we should perhaps find that but few of the emotions we\r\nexperience are to be traced to events and circumstance which have\r\noccurred in our own time.\r\n\r\nWe admire the heroes of Grecian history and even of Grecian fable.  We\r\nare inspired by ancient poetry and eloquence, as well as by the bards\r\nand orators of modern times.  Painting and sculpture are the equal\r\nadmiration of every refined age.  The virtue of patriotism has been\r\nillustrated by savage as well as civilized life.  Thus every recorded\r\nevent of the past has somewhat of value for us.  Hence men seek to\r\nconnect themselves by blood and language with Europe, or even with\r\nAsia, and delight to trace their family and name into the dark\r\ncenturies of the Past.  We search for the truth amid the myths and\r\nfables of Grecian and Roman history, and have faith that the ruins of\r\nNinevah, Memphis and Palmyra shall yet declare the civilities,\r\nlearning, and religion of ancient days.\r\n\r\nFew nations have had a perfect history.  Valuable history can be\r\nderived only from the continued record of the transactions of a people.\r\nWherever governments have existed in fact before they have existed in\r\nform, or wherever the proceedings of a government have not been matters\r\nof record, there can be no trustworthy history.  In these respects\r\nMassachusetts has been fortunate.  Her government is older than her\r\nexistence as colonies, and from the first a faithful record of her\r\nproceedings has been made.  The foundations of New Plymouth and\r\nMassachusetts were laid more than two centuries ago; the circumstances\r\nof this occasion lead us to consider the least defensible portions of\r\ntheir history; yet the world cannot charge them with suppressing any\r\nfact necessary to a true appreciation of their policy and character.\r\nWhatever they did was in the fear of God and without the fear of man.\r\nConscious of their own integrity of purpose, they shrunk not from the\r\njudgment of posterity.  And though in this hour we may not always\r\napprove their policy, so neither can we comprehend their principles or\r\nappreciate their trials.  The human family has ever been subject to one\r\ngreat law.  It is this:  Inferior races disappear in the presence of\r\ntheir superiors, or become dependent upon them.  Now, while this law\r\nshall not stand as a defence for our fathers, it is satisfactory to\r\nfeel that no policy could have civilized or even saved the Indian\r\ntribes of Massachusetts.  The remnants that linger in our midst are\r\nnot the representatives of the native nobility of the forest two\r\ncenturies ago.  Nor did Williams or Eliot, by kindness or religion,\r\never command the fierce spirits of Miantonomo, Canonchet and Philip.\r\nNevertheless, let history exalt these men.  Let it speak truly of\r\ntheir genius, their courage, their patriotism, their devotion to their\r\nrace, and, as for Massachusetts, she shall be known and read of all\r\nfrom the dark day when the colony of Plymouth had not ten efficient\r\nmen, to this auspicious moment when within our borders a million of\r\nfree and happy people speak the language and glory in the descent of\r\nthe Pilgrim Fathers!\r\n\r\nThe existence of Massachusetts is properly divided into three parts.\r\n\r\nFirst, as a colony from the settlement of Plymouth in 1620, to the loss\r\nof the Massachusetts charter in 1684.  Second, as a province from the\r\ncharter for the Province of William and Mary in 1691, to the\r\nDeclaration of Independence in 1776.  Third, as a State from 1780 to\r\nthe present time.  As a colony, the civil rights of our ancestors were\r\nthose of British subjects, but their political and religious privileges\r\nwere much greater.  As a province their civil rights remained,\r\nreligious freedom was extended, while their political privileges were\r\nmaterially limited.\r\n\r\nThe occasion, these services, this monument and inscription, connect us\r\nwith the colony.  We are not here so much reminded of the men who fell,\r\nas of the sacrifices and sufferings of the colonies in 1675 and '76.\r\nThe period of King Philip's War was the most trying and perilous in our\r\nhistory.  The Revolution was a struggle for freedom; the contest with\r\nPhilip was for existence.  Philip contemplated the extermination of the\r\nEnglish in America, while King George only desired their subjugation to\r\nhis authority.  Nor was the latter ever so near the accomplishment of\r\nhis design as was the former in the autumn of 1675.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts has seen no other such winter as that which followed.\r\n\r\n  \"Morn came, and went--and came, and brought not day,\r\n   And men forgot their passions in the dread\r\n   Of this their desolation.\"\r\n\r\nAs late as March, 1676, says Hubbard, \"it was full sea with Philip's\r\naffairs.\"  And even on the 26th of April, the Plymouth colony writes\r\nthus to Massachusetts:\r\n\r\n\"The Lord undertake for us, for we are in a very low condition; and the\r\nspirits of our people begin to run low, also being now averse to going\r\nforth against the enemies.  The Lord have us patient to wait God's\r\ntime, although our salvation seems still to be far from us.\"\r\n\r\nThe war commenced on the 24th day of June, 1675, and ended on the 12th\r\nof August, 1676, by the death of Philip.\r\n\r\nThe colonies of Massachusetts, Plymouth, Connecticut and New Haven were\r\nunited, and Governor Josiah Winslow of Plymouth was appointed\r\ncommander-in-chief.\r\n\r\nNeither the population nor the available force of the colonies is now\r\nknown.  Some writers have estimated the population of New England at a\r\nhundred and twenty thousand.  This is plainly an exaggeration.  From a\r\nfew scattered fragments and facts we may conclude that Massachusetts\r\nhad a force of about 4,500 men, New Haven and Connecticut about 2,000,\r\nand Plymouth about 1,300; in all about 8,000 men.  Of these\r\nMassachusetts had a cavalry force seven hundred strong.  Upon this\r\nbasis the entire population could not have exceeded 60,000, and some\r\nwriters, on the other hand, have estimated it at only forty thousand\r\nsouls.  But, whatever may have been the number of able-bodied men in\r\nthe colonies, the available force for active service must have been\r\nsmall.  A large number of towns were to be garrisoned, and many men\r\nwere necessarily employed in the customary duties of life.\r\n\r\nStill less is known of the strength of Philip's confederated tribes.\r\nPestilence and war had depopulated New England previous to the arrival\r\nof the Pilgrims.  In 1675 the Pokanokets and Narragansets were the most\r\npowerful, and together mustered three or four thousand warriors.\r\nPhilip was sachem of the Pokanokets and Canonchet of the Narragansets.\r\nThese tribes constituted Philip's reliable strength, but he had\r\nconfederated with him and pledged to the common cause the smaller\r\nchiefs of the Piscataqua and Merrimack, of central Massachusetts and\r\nthe valley of the Connecticut.  The Narragansets occupied what is now\r\nRhode Island and the islands adjacent thereto, while Philip as the\r\nchief of the Pokanokets or Wampanoags had his seat at Montaup or Mount\r\nHope.  It was not, however, expedient or possible for him to consecrate\r\na large force upon any one point.  With his forces divided into war\r\nparties as necessity or circumstances dictated, he was able in the\r\nspace of thirteen months to attack and partially or entirely destroy a\r\ngreat number of towns, among which were Brookfield, Lancaster,\r\nMarlboro', Sudbury, Groton, Deerfield, Springfield, Hatfield,\r\nNorthfield, Northampton, Chelmsford, Andover, Medfield, Rehoboth,\r\nPlymouth, Scituate, Weymouth, and Middleborough in Massachusetts, and\r\nNew Plymouth, Providence and Warwick in Rhode Island.  Of these, twelve\r\nor thirteen were entirely destroyed.\r\n\r\nSix hundred dwellings were burned, and sixteen hundred persons slain\r\nor carried into captivity.  There was not a house standing between\r\nStonington and Providence.  It was as destructive as a war would now be\r\nto Massachusetts which should send twenty thousand able-bodied men to\r\nthe grave, and render twenty thousand families houseless, and for the\r\nmost part destitute.  Had all the events of the Revolution been crowded\r\ninto twelve months, the conflict would have been less terrible than was\r\nthe war with Philip.  His operations menaced and endangered the\r\nexistence of the colony.  There was a probability that the taunting\r\nthreat of John Monoco, the leader of the party which burned Groton,\r\nthat he would burn Chelmsford, Concord, Watertown, Cambridge,\r\nCharlestown, Roxbury and Boston, might even be executed.  Hardly\r\nanything else remained of the Massachusetts colony on which the power\r\nand vengeance of Philip could fall.  Points of the interior, to be\r\nsure, were garrisoned, but for the most part it was an unbroken forest,\r\nor marked only by heaps of smouldering ruins.\r\n\r\nAnd here may we well pause and reflect, that however we or posterity\r\nmay judge the Indian policy of our ancestors, the scenes through\r\nwhich they passed were not calculated to mitigate the horrors of war,\r\nor in the hour of triumph to awaken emotions of pity for the fallen.\r\n\r\nAs for the Indians, they were destroyed.  Their great sachems had\r\nfallen.  Anawon, Canonchet, Philip, were no more.  Nor had their\r\nfighting men survived them.  Their towns, of which they had many, were\r\nburned.  And why should the humble wigwam remain when the heroic spirit\r\nof its occupant had departed?\r\n\r\nAnd, worse than all, the women and children had been massacred or sold\r\ninto slavery.\r\n\r\n  ----\"few remain\r\n  To strive, and those must strive in vain.\"\r\n\r\nPeace came; but--sad thought--there was no treaty of peace.  It was a\r\nwar of extermination.  Not often in the history of the world has it\r\nhappened thus.  The colonists believed that they had been fighting the\r\nbattles of God's chosen people.  Mather says, \"the evident hand of\r\nHeaven appearing on the side of the people, whose hope and help were\r\nalone in the Almighty Lord of Hosts, extinguished those nations of\r\nsavages at such a rate, that there can hardly any of them now be found\r\nunder any distinction upon the face of the earth.\"\r\n\r\nAt some points in New Hampshire and the district of Maine, the fires of\r\nwar flickered ere they went forever out.  Omitting comparatively\r\nunimportant incursions, the Indian wars of Massachusetts and New\r\nPlymouth were ended.  The existence of these hitherto feeble\r\nsettlements was rendered certain.  Although political and religious\r\ncontroversies occupied the attention of the settlers, they yet found\r\nmeans to cultivate the arts of peace.  The forest was broken up,\r\ncommerce was increased, agriculture flourished, new settlements were\r\nmade, confidence was created, men saw before them a future in which\r\nthey had hope.  As our fathers passed from war to peace they forgot\r\nnot their religious duties, and the 29th of June in Massachusetts, and\r\nthe 17th of August in Plymouth, were set part as days of public\r\nthanksgiving and praise.  Days of sadness, too, they must have been;\r\ndays of woe as well as of triumph.  The colonies were bereaved in the\r\nloss of brave and valuable men,--families were bereaved in the loss of\r\nhomes,--and all were bereaved in the fall or captivity of kindred and\r\nfriends.  And could our ancestors have seen that this was the first\r\ngreat step in the red man's solemn march to the grave, a tear of\r\nsympathy would have fallen in behalf of a noble and heroic race.\r\n\r\nThe war was brief; its operations were rapid.  In the space of less\r\nthan fourteen months the Indians were exterminated and the whites\r\nreduced to the condition I have faintly portrayed.  Yet, until the\r\n19th of December, 1675, when the colonists made a most destructive\r\nattack upon the Indians at what is now South Kingston, the war had\r\nbeen confined chiefly to the valley of the Connecticut.  But from that\r\nmoment Philip was like a hungry tiger goaded in confinement, suddenly\r\nlet loose upon his prey.  The destruction of villages and the deadly\r\nambuscade of bodies of men followed each other in quick succession.  In\r\nthe space of sixty days his forces attacked Lancaster, Medfield,\r\nWeymouth, Groton, Warwick, Marlboro', Rehoboth, Providence, Chelmsford,\r\nAndover and Sudbury.  At least one half of the death and desolation of\r\nthis war was crowded into this short period of time.\r\n\r\nThere was no security except in garrisons defended by armed men.  The\r\nIndian marches exceeded in celerity the movements of well-furnished\r\ncavalry in civilized countries.  Their women even aided in the march\r\nand in the camp.  Accustomed to hardship and famine, they subsisted in\r\na manner incredible to our time and race.  And with one or two\r\nexceptions, when the colonists came upon the Indians unexpectedly, the\r\nlatter were superior in the strategic arts of war, though in open\r\nfight their fire was much less destructive.  It must be confessed that\r\nCaptain Lathrop at Bloody Brook, and Captain Wadsworth at Sudbury,\r\nwere, in a degree, incautious.  Hubbard closes his account of the\r\ndisaster with these words:\r\n\r\n\"Thus, as in former attempts of like nature, too much courage and\r\neagerness in pursuit of the enemy hath added another fatal blow to\r\nthis poor country.\"\r\n\r\nFor a long period a feeling of insecurity oppressed the settlers.  Each\r\ntown was furnished with a garrison.  The Indian trail was the signal\r\nfor alarm, and through long years the events of Philip's war were borne\r\nby tradition and history to itching ears and timid hearts in the\r\ngarrison and family circle.\r\n\r\nPassing from the principal features of this bloody contest, we feel\r\nthat its details are less certain.\r\n\r\nIn 1676, Sudbury was a frontier town, although settled as early as\r\n1638.  Marlboro' was attacked and nearly destroyed the 26th of March,\r\n1676.  Captain Sam'l Brocklebank, of Rowley, with a company of Essex\r\nmen, was stationed at Marlboro'; but his apprehensions of danger were\r\nso slight that he asked to be relieved from the service.  On the 27th\r\nof March, Lieutenant Jacobs, of Captain Brocklebank's company, with\r\nforty soldiers, one half of whom were Sudbury men, attacked a party\r\nof 300 sleeping Indians, and disabled thirty of them without the loss\r\nof a man.  The news of the attack upon Marlboro' early furnished by\r\nCaptain Brocklebank induced the Council to order Captain Wadsworth of\r\nMilton, with about fifty men, to its relief.  At or near Marlboro' he\r\nwas informed that Sudbury was the besieged town.  It is certain that he\r\nleft his young men in the garrison at Marlboro' under the command of\r\nLieutenant Jacobs, and he was probably joined by Captain Brocklebank\r\nwith a part or the whole of his command.  It is said that Wadsworth\r\nhad marched from Boston that day, yet he moved immediately for the\r\nrelief of Sudbury.  Presuming that the hill where this monument stands\r\nis that to which Captain Wadsworth was forced by the Indians, their\r\ndecoy-outposts must have been a mile or a mile and a half on the way\r\nto Marlboro'.\r\n\r\nCaptain Wadsworth estimated the number of Indians first discovered at\r\none hundred.  These he pursued about a mile, when he found himself\r\nsurrounded by a body of savages four or five hundred strong.  Captain\r\nWadsworth was probably at the bloody fight of the 19th of December, he\r\nwas in the Narraganset country about the 1st of January, and he had\r\nmarched at the head of forty men to the relief of Lancaster, yet he\r\nappears from the little truth within our reach, to have neglected those\r\nprecautions essential to safety in Indian warfare.  But is should be\r\nremembered that Captain Wadsworth and Captain Brocklebank were born\r\nabout the time of the Pequot War, and could have had no experience in\r\nsimilar service previous to hostilities with Philip.\r\n\r\nThe loss of men is not certainly known, nor do writers agree that the\r\nfight took place on the 18th of April.\r\n\r\nThe inscription upon the monument follows the authority of President\r\nWadsworth of Harvard College, son of Captain Wadsworth, and for a\r\nportion of his life minister of the first church in Boston.  He had\r\nsuperior facilities for ascertaining the truth and strong motives for\r\nstating it.  He puts the loss at twenty-nine officers and men, and\r\nfixes upon the 18th of April as the day of the fight.\r\n\r\nHis statement is sustained by the evidence I have gathered.  Some\r\nwriters have put the loss at fifty, and others as high as seventy men,\r\nbut these numbers exceed the truth.  Wadsworth had fifty men;\r\nBrocklebank may have had as many more.  We can account for about\r\nninety-six.  On the 24th of April, Lieutenant Jacobs acknowledges the\r\nreceipt of his charge as Captain, in place of Captain Brocklebank, and\r\ninforms the Governor and his Council that his company consists of\r\nabout forty-six men, a portion of whom were left at Marlboro' by\r\nCaptain Wadsworth.\r\n\r\nHubbard says, that of Wadsworth's company, not above twenty escaped,\r\nand Daniel Warren and Joseph Pierce, who buried the dead, say that\r\nfourteen or fifteen of Captain Wadsworth's men were concealed at Mr.\r\nNoist's mill.  Taking the statements of Hubbard and Jacobs, we\r\naccount for ninety-six officers and men, viz.:  forty-seven left at\r\nMarlboro', twenty-nine killed, and twenty escaped.\r\n\r\nSome writer has stated that the battle was fought on the 21st, instead\r\nof the 18th of April.  It may not be proved that the battle was fought\r\non the 18th, but it is determined that it was fought previous to the\r\n21st.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of April, the Massachusetts Council communicated the fact\r\nin writing to the Plymouth Colony.  It is true that Lieutenant Jacobs\r\ndoes not mention the loss of Wadsworth and Brocklebank in a letter to\r\nthe Governor and Council, dated at Marlboro' on the 22nd of April; but\r\nin his letter of the 24th, he refers to the subject as he might have\r\ndone, had he received the intelligence when he received his authority\r\nto take the command of the fort and men at Marlboro'.  And this was\r\nprobably the case.  That communication between the two towns was\r\nsuspended, is apparent from Jacobs' letter of the 22nd of April, to\r\nwhich I have referred.  The conclusion, I think, is that, under the\r\ncircumstances, there is a reasonable amount of evidence in support of\r\nthe statement of President Wadsworth.\r\n\r\nThe loss of Wadsworth and Brocklebank was severely felt by the colony.\r\nHubbard says, \"Wadsworth was a resolute, stout-hearted soldier, and\r\nBrocklebank a choice, spirited man.\"  Mather says, \"but the worst part\r\nof the story is, that Captain Wadsworth, one worthy to live in our\r\nhistory under the name of a good man, coming up after a long, hard,\r\nunwearied march with seventy men unto the relief of distressed Sudbury,\r\nfound himself in the woods on the sudden, surrounded with about five\r\nhundred of the enemy, whereupon our men fought like men, and more than\r\nso.\"\r\n\r\nCapt. Samuel Wadsworth was the youngest son of Christopher Wadsworth,\r\none of the early Plymouth Pilgrims, who settled at Duxbury with Capt.\r\nMiles Standish.  Samuel Wadsworth was born in Duxbury about 1630, and\r\nwas therefore forty-five or six years of age when he died.  He first\r\nappears at Milton, in 1656, where he took up three hundred acres of\r\nland near the center of the town.  He was interested in obtaining the\r\nseparation of the town from Dorchester and in its incorporation in\r\n1662.  In the new town he was the first captain of the militia, one of\r\nthe selectmen, a member of the House of Representatives, a trustee of\r\nthe church and active in church affairs.  That he was highly esteemed\r\nin the town is apparent from these facts as well as from a memorial of\r\nRobert Babcock, one of the selectmen of Milton.  He feelingly alludes\r\nto the loss in these words:  _\"Captain Wadsworth being departed from\r\nus, whose face we shall see here no more.\"_\r\n\r\nCapt. Samuel Brocklebank, of Rowley, was born in England, and was also\r\nabout forty-six years of age at the time of his death.  In November,\r\n1675, he informed Governor Leverett that he had impressed twelve men\r\nfor the war.  Of these, seven returned to Rowley.  His correspondence\r\nwith the Council shows him to have been a man of respectable attainments.\r\n\r\nAs then the colonies and the town shared a common grief in the loss of\r\nthese devoted men, so now it is appropriate that the State and town\r\nshould unite in the erection of this unpretending memorial of their\r\nnames and virtues.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1676, Philip's power was at its height.  But his successes\r\nhad weakened him.  His warriors were slain or scattered all over the\r\ncountry, his provisions and ammunition were exhausted, and Canonchet,\r\nhis most valuable ally, had planned his last ambuscade, and rallied\r\nhis Narragansets for the last time.  The rapidity of Philip's\r\nmovements, and the fierceness of his attacks, had deprived his\r\nwarriors of the moral power to withstand reverses.  His operations for\r\ntwo months had been those of a desperate man; and when desperation is\r\nfollowed by misfortune there is no hope of recovery.\r\n\r\nThe winter campaign of 1675-6 was opened and conducted with great vigor\r\non the part of the colonies.\r\n\r\nThe second of December was appointed and set apart as a day of solemn\r\nhumiliation for the imploring of God's special grace and favor to\r\nappear for his poor people.  Then the treasurer was clothed with\r\nunlimited power to borrow money, and authorized to pledge the public\r\nlands acquired and to be acquired for the payment of the war debt; one\r\nthousand stands of arms and a corresponding quantity of ammunition\r\nwere ordered; men were impressed for active service in the field, for\r\nthe erection and defence of garrisons, and for the tillage of the soil;\r\nthe women and children of the frontier towns were sent towards the\r\ncoast; the Indian trading houses were abolished; and even the members\r\nof Harvard College were required to pay their proportion of rates, and\r\nto serve in the army either personally or by substitute.\r\n\r\nThe Council were instructed to use their \"utmost endeavors, with\r\npromise of such rewards as they judge meet, to get the Mohegans and\r\nPequots\" to cut off the Indians of Philip.  Governor Winslow was\r\ncommander-in-chief, and was instructed by \"care, courage, diligence,\r\npolicy and favor, to discover, pursue and encounter, and by the help\r\nof God to vanquish and subdue the cruel, barbarous and treacherous\r\nenemy, whether Philip Sachem and his Wampanoags, or the Narraganset\r\nand his undoubted allies, or any other their friends and abettors.\"\r\n\r\nCanonchet, son of Miantonomo and grand nephew of Canonicus, was chief\r\nof the Narragansets.  When the colonists first became acquainted with\r\nthis tribe, Canonicus was their sachem, but his nephew Miantonomo was\r\nassociated with him in the government.  This sachem was never a friend\r\nto the English, and he early sent to Plymouth a bundle of arrows bound\r\nin a rattle-snake's skin as a war challenge.  Miantonomo was less\r\nhostile, but Canonchet manifested the spirit of his grand uncle.\r\nImmediately after hostilities commenced with Philip the English\r\ndemanded of Canonchet the surrender of certain Pokanokets alleged to be\r\nwithin his dominions.  This was his reply:  \"Deliver the Indians of\r\nPhilip!  Never.  Not a Wampanoag will I ever give up.  No.  Not the\r\nparing of a Wampanoag's nail.\"\r\n\r\nHe was of course charged with being in alliance with Philip.  A force\r\nof a thousand men with such Indian allies as could be mustered, was\r\nmarched immediately into his country.  This was the force engaged on\r\nthe 19th of December in the famous Swamp Fight, the most sanguinary\r\nbattle of Philip's War.  Six hundred warriors were slain, six hundred\r\nwigwams were burned, and an unknown number of women, children and old\r\nmen perished in the flames.  The English loss exceeded two hundred,\r\namong whom were several brave officers.  From this moment the fortunes\r\nof Canonchet were identified with Philip's, and he is supposed to have\r\ncommanded in many of the attacks upon the frontier towns.  About the\r\nlast of March, 1676, he visited the Connecticut River to urge, if not\r\nto superintend the planting of corn.  Finding his people destitute of\r\nseed, he returned to obtain a supply, but was arrested at Seekonk and\r\nexecuted at Stonington.  His death was a sad blow to Philip, and the\r\noccasion of a great joy in the colonies.  When told that he must die,\r\nhe said:\r\n\r\n\"It is well.  I shall die before my heart is soft.  I will speak\r\nnothing which Canonchet should be ashamed to speak.  It is well.\"\r\n\r\nThus fell Canonchet, the last great chief of the Narragansets.  A man\r\nso noble and chivalric in his spirit that his life and death commanded\r\nthe admiration of his worst enemies.  They vainly imagined that some\r\ndisembodied spirit of Greece or Rome had revisited the earth in the\r\nvast physical and mental proportions of Canonchet.\r\n\r\nForty years before, the friendship of his father, Miantonomo, and the\r\nqualified hostility he assumed towards Sassacus and the Pequots had\r\nsaved the infant colonies from destruction.  Sassacus, the Pequot\r\nchief, had proposed to Canonicus an alliance against the English, but\r\nin consequence of the advice of Roger Williams, Miantonomo visited\r\nGovernor Winthrop at Boston, was received and entertained with great\r\nceremony, and finally concluded with the colonies a treaty of peace\r\nand alliance.  Its main provisions were these:\r\n\r\n1st.  Peace with Massachusetts and the other English plantations.\r\n\r\n2nd.  Neither party to make peace with the Pequots without the consent\r\nof the other.\r\n\r\n3rd.  Neither party to harbor Pequots.\r\n\r\n4th.  Murderers escaping from either party to be put to death or\r\ndelivered up to the other.\r\n\r\n5th.  Fugitive servants to be returned.\r\n\r\nThis treaty rendered the cause of the Pequots hopeless, and secured the\r\nsafety of the English.\r\n\r\nIt was in the main observed by the Narragansets.  They allowed the\r\ncolonial army to pass through their territories, and furnished five\r\nhundred men for the war.\r\n\r\nUncas, the chief of the Mohegans, had also been an ally of the English\r\nagainst the Pequots.  After the destruction of this tribe, the three\r\nparties declared a peace, and the spoils of the war were divided\r\nbetween the allies.  But the Narragansets and Mohegans were naturally\r\nenemies.  The latter were of the Pequot race, and Uncas himself, having\r\nmarried the daughter of Sassacus, was but a revolted subject of that\r\ngreat chief.  It is said that one of Uncas' dependent sachems attacked\r\nMiantonomo, who referred the matter to the English and was told to take\r\nhis own course, and invaded the Mohegan country with a thousand\r\nwarriors.  The fortunes of war were against him and he fell into the\r\nhands of Uncas.  The victor now referred the fate of his victim to the\r\nEnglish.  They decided that the rules of war permitted, and the safety\r\nof Uncas required, the death of Miantonomo.  They were careful,\r\nhowever, not to permit his execution within their jurisdiction.  The\r\ncolonies were responsible for the death of this chief.  Uncas was\r\nnominally their ally, but really their subject.  From first to last\r\nhe did their bidding with a spirit so craven and a manner so\r\ntreacherous that he was neither trusted nor respected by them.  But\r\nthe English in their death-warrant voluntarily offered to protect\r\nUncas from the consequences of Miantonomo's death.  This was in 1643,\r\nand thus did the English observe the treaty of peace made seven years\r\nbefore under circumstances of extraordinary solemnity.  Miantonomo died\r\nthe victim of rivalry, jealousy and fear, yet with a spirit so heroic\r\nthat he scorned to ask the precious boon of life from those whom he had\r\nserved rather than wronged.  His death was the seed of the war of 1675,\r\n--for how, under these circumstances, could Canonchet, his son and\r\nsuccessor, be other than the enemy of the English, the ready and\r\nefficient ally of Philip.\r\n\r\nBut aside from particular incidents in the relations of the English to\r\nthe Indians there were three ever-operating causes of hostility.\r\n\r\n1st.  The mutual disposition of the English and the Indians to traffic\r\nwith each other.  The colonies passed the most stringent laws for the\r\nsuppression of this traffic, or to make it a monopoly in their own\r\nhands, and the government at home issued two or more proclamations.\r\nThese laws and proclamations had no great practical value, and the\r\nIndians were constantly supplied with spirits, clothing, munitions and\r\nweapons of war, either by the English, French, or Dutch.  Thus trade\r\nfurnished an occasion for hostility, and the means of gratifying the\r\nspirit of war.\r\n\r\n2nd.  There was a universal tendency in the people and governments of\r\nthe colonies to acquire land.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, a settled purpose on the part of the company in\r\nEngland and the governments here to make this spirit conform to the\r\nprinciples of honor and justice.  In the company's letter of\r\ninstruction of April 17, 1629, Endicott and his Council were told that\r\n\"If any of the savages pretend right of inheritance to all or any part\r\nof the lands granted in our patent, we pray you to endeavor to purchase\r\ntheir title, that we may avoid the least scruple of intrusion.\"  And in\r\na second letter of the 28th of May following, the same injunction is\r\nimposed upon the settlers.  Attempts were made to pursue the course\r\npointed out by the company, and a penalty of five pounds per acre was\r\nimposed upon any person who should receive an Indian title without the\r\nconsent of the government.  Governor Winslow, in 1676, writes thus:  \"I\r\nthink I can clearly say, that before the present trouble broke out, the\r\nEnglish did not possess one foot of land in this colony but what was\r\nfairly obtained by honest purchase of the Indian proprietors.\"\r\n\r\nIt is no doubt true that for the most part the lands were purchased,\r\nand, according to the idea of the English, honorably purchased, yet the\r\nnatives could not fail to foresee the result of these cessions of\r\nterritory.  There were English settlements at Bridgewater, Middleboro',\r\nTaunton, Rehoboth, Seekonk, and Swanzey, all within the ancient\r\njurisdiction of Massasoit.  And as a perpetual monitor to Philip of\r\nhis limited domains, though in obedience to a different and highly\r\nhonorable motive, the people erected a fence quite across the neck of\r\nland on the south of Swanzey, and thus confined the Pokanokets by metes\r\nand bounds.\r\n\r\nThat Philip was annoyed by applications for land is evident from his\r\nletter, without date, addressed to Governor Prince of Plymouth:\r\n\r\n\"Philip would intreat that favor of you, and any of the magistrates,\r\nif any English or Indians speak about any land, he pray to give them no\r\nanswer at all.  This last summer he made that promise with you, that\r\nhe would sell no land in seven years' time, for that he would have no\r\nEnglish trouble him before that time.  He has not forgot that you\r\npromise him.\"\r\n\r\nThe apostle Eliot, in a letter to the Massachusetts government, dated\r\nin 1684, asking that certain fraudulent purchases of the Indians might\r\nbe annulled, puts this suggestive inquiry:  \"Was not a principal cause\r\nof the late war about encroachments on Philip's land at Mount Hope?\"\r\n\r\nThe third disturbing cause was the desire of our ancestors to convert\r\nthe Indian chiefs and tribes to Christianity.  This was a primary and\r\nchief object of the settlement of the country.  Governor Craddock, in\r\na letter of February, 1629, to Endicott and his Council, says:  \"You\r\nwill demean yourselves justly and courteously toward the Indians,\r\nthereby to draw them to affect our persons, and consequently our\r\nreligion.\"  And the Governor of Massachusetts colony by his oath was\r\nrequired to use his \"best endeavor to draw on the natives of New\r\nEngland to the knowledge of the true God.\"  The company in England also\r\nexpressed the hope that the ministers who were sent out would, by\r\nfaithful preaching, godly conversation and exemplary lives, in God's\r\nappointed time, reduce the Indians to the obedience of the Gospel of\r\nChrist.  And there is no fact in the history of the colonists\r\ninconsistent with an earnest purpose to accomplish so desirable a\r\nresult.  But the most formidable and warlike of the Indian tribes\r\nresisted the introduction of Christianity, not on account of its\r\ndoctrines,--these they never comprehended; but its acceptance was\r\nregarded by them as an acknowledgment of political inferiority.  When\r\nPhilip protests against the jurisdiction of the English, he thinks to\r\nestablish his independence by asserting that he was never a praying\r\nIndian.  It naturally happened that those Indians who embraced\r\nChristianity were more or less attached to the English, and soon\r\nassumed the position of dependent inferiors.  They were consequently\r\ndespised by such fierce spirits as swayed the Narraganset and Pokanoket\r\ntribes.  But the English were instant in season and out of season in\r\nsecuring assent to their doctrines, though they must often have known\r\nthat there was neither conviction of the head nor conversion of the\r\nheart.  The colonists on some occasions even made a formal assent to\r\nthe Christian faith a condition of allegiance.\r\n\r\nAlthough Uncas never received the Christian religion, his friendly\r\nrelations with the English gave him an importance and power which were\r\noffensive to the neighboring tribes; and there is reason to suppose\r\nthat a desire to humble him was an element of the war.\r\n\r\nThe attack upon the Pequots, whether necessary or not, must have\r\nproduced an unfavorable impression upon the neighboring tribes; but\r\nthe death of Miantonomo was the cause of the undying hostility of the\r\nNarragansets, and made Canonchet the ready coadjutor of King Philip,--\r\nand without Canonchet Philip could never have been formidable to the\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nBut passing by all the occasions or causes of war to which I have\r\nreferred, we may presume from our knowledge of Philip's character,\r\nthat he considered his personal injuries a sufficient ground for\r\nhostilities.  Massasoit, his father, had been the firm friend but never\r\nthe subject of the English.  He was rather their protector, and the\r\ncolonists ever maintained towards him the kindest feelings.\r\n\r\nHis son Alexander succeeded him.  A suspicion was early entertained by\r\nthe English that he was plotting with the Narragansets.  He was\r\nsummoned to appear at Plymouth, but he avoided the summons upon some\r\npretence, which probably had no real foundation.  The Governor of\r\nPlymouth with about ten men proceeded to compel his attendance.\r\nAlexander was then upon a hunting excursion with a small party of\r\nwarriors.  He was found in Middleboro', refreshing himself in a tent\r\nafter the fatigues of the chase.  His arms, having been left outside,\r\nwere seized by the English.  Some accounts state that Alexander went\r\nvoluntarily towards Plymouth, others say that the Governor told him\r\nthat if he did not go he was a dead man.  But all accounts agree that\r\nhe was soon violently sick, and that the efforts to relieve him were\r\nunavailing.  He was allowed to return home and was borne away upon the\r\nshoulders of his faithful warriors.  Hubbard says, \"Such was the pride\r\nand height of his spirit, that the very surprisal of him so raised his\r\ncholer and indignation, that it put him into a fever, which,\r\nnotwithstanding all possible means that could be used, seemed mortal.\"\r\nAnd so it proved.\r\n\r\nPhilip witnessed this unjust arrest of his brother, chief of a proud\r\nand free race; he remembered his father's services and fidelity; he saw\r\nhis people dispossessed of their hunting grounds, and an unknown\r\nreligion zealously pressed upon them.  To him there was in the present\r\nonly humiliation and disgrace, in the future only ignominy and death.\r\nWith this history and these gloomy anticipations of the future, Philip\r\nbecame the sachem of the Pokanokets.  He had never been a favorite\r\nwith the English, yet early in life they had named him Philip, and\r\nhis brother Wamsutta, Alexander; a singular yet just appreciation of\r\ntheir high spirit and warlike character.  The colonists justly regarded\r\nthese young men as dangerous to the public peace, and there was never\r\na moment of true friendship after the death of Massasoit.\r\n\r\nThe particular occasion of the war was the murder by Philip's agents of\r\none Sassamon, an educated Indian, who had been his private secretary.\r\nHaving in this confidential station obtained a knowledge of Philip's\r\nplans, he went to the English, by whom he had been educated, and\r\nprobably disclosed his master's secrets.  Philip secured his death, and\r\nof all who fell in fight or fray, or on the gallows swung, none\r\ndeserved death before Sassamon.  The comprehensive mind of Philip saw\r\nat once the terrible nature and probable consequences of the war thus\r\nbrought upon him.  It is said that he wept, and that from that time\r\nforth he never smiled.  But he laid new sacrifices upon the altar of\r\nhis people's liberty, invoked the spirit of his ancestors, and\r\nexhibited resources and courage worthy of a heroic age.\r\n\r\nHe stood in a position of great and manifest peril.  The English were\r\nsuperior in numbers, comparatively well equipped, and above all united.\r\nThey had garrisoned towns to which they could fly.  Philip's own tribe\r\nwas comparatively weak, but he easily associated the Narragansets with\r\nhim.  But this combined force was inadequate to the emergency.  He\r\nunited many of the tribes of Massachusetts, New Hampshire and\r\nConnecticut, and as far as possible animated them with his own\r\nunconquerable will.  You may imagine him standing among the dark men of\r\nthe forest and with a rugged yet burning eloquence reciting the history\r\nof their common wrongs, or with prophetic power lifting the veil from\r\nthe shadowy, though not to him uncertain, future.\r\n\r\nHe was continually subject to great personal dangers.  A price was set\r\nupon his head, the Christian Indians were allies of the English and\r\ncontinually employed against him, while above all Uncas and the\r\nMohegans were his deadly enemies.  Hunted by English and Indians,\r\nassailed by famine and treachery, weakened by death and desertion, his\r\nfate was inevitable.  When his warriors had fallen in battle, been sold\r\ninto slavery or corrupted by bribes, when his old men and women, and\r\nchildren had perished, when the first of the enemy had laid in ashes\r\nthe wigwams and villages of the Pokanokets and their allies, when to\r\nhis race there was neither seed-time nor harvest, he came to the home\r\nof his ancestors, and there his troubled spirit, contrasting sadly in\r\ndeath as in life with the placid scenes of nature around, passed\r\nforever away.  He fell by the hand of his own race,--\r\n\r\n  \"Darkly, sternly, and all alone\r\n   A spoil--the richest and the last.\"\r\n\r\nPhilip's son, a boy nine years of age, was sold into slavery, and the\r\nroyal race of Massasoit was extinct.\r\n\r\nAs all our information of Carthage and the Punic wars has been\r\ntransmitted by Roman authors, so our knowledge of Philip and the war of\r\n1675-6, is derived from partial and in some instances prejudiced\r\nsources.  Yet it is just to say that our ancestors made no concealment\r\nof the facts, although the comments of Mather and Hubbard are often\r\nstrangely barbarous in spirit.  And further, we may be certain that our\r\nPilgrim Fathers were true to the light that was in them; and that their\r\nmemory will grow green with years and blossom through the flight of\r\nages.\r\n\r\nIf to-day we have seen the bright side of Indian character, contrasted\r\nwith the few harsh features of the New England colonists, it is that\r\nthis occasion, while it calls forth feelings of gratitude and reverence\r\nfor the men and history of the Past may have somewhat of a practical\r\nvalue in the Present and the Future.  The men of the forest have not\r\ndisappeared entirely, though\r\n\r\n  \"They waste--they shrink away;\r\n   And fast we follow, as they go\r\n   Towards the setting day.\"\r\n\r\nAnd if in the Providence of God the race is soon to be extinct, let not\r\ninjustice, oppression, or war, increase their woes or hasten their decay.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\nLOUIS KOSSUTH*\r\n\r\nWhen Louis Kossuth landed in New York, December 5, 1851, he was not an\r\nunknown personage.  He and his native land had been made known to the\r\npeople of the United States by the Revolution of 1848 and the contest\r\nof 1849 for the independence of Hungary.  Until those events occurred,\r\nHungary was only a marked spot on the map of Europe, and the name of\r\nKossuth, as a leader in industrial and social progress, had not been\r\nwritten or spoken on this side of the Atlantic; but in the year 1851\r\nthere was no other person of a foreign race and language of whose name\r\nand career as much was known.\r\n\r\nThere was no exaggeration in Mr. Emerson's words of address to Kossuth:\r\n\"You have got your story told in every palace, and log hut, and prairie\r\ncamp throughout this continent.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the first Kossuth recognized a special interest in the\r\ncommonwealth of Massachusetts.  This interest was due in part to the\r\nhistory of the State, from which he drew many lessons of instruction\r\nand much confidence that personal liberty and the independence and\r\nsovereignty of states would become universal possessions.  Beyond these\r\nconsiderations the invitation to him from Massachusetts was made\r\nJanuary 8, 1852,--among the first of the States of the Union.\r\n\r\nIn my annual address to the Legislature, delivered the 15th of January,\r\nI said:  \"Your action will be regarded as an expression of the sympathy\r\nof Massachusetts for the distinguished exile, and for the cause of\r\nEuropean liberty, which he so truly represents.  The common sentiment\r\nof America is on the side of constitutional governments.\"\r\n\r\nThe resolutions of the Legislature and the letter of the Governor were\r\npresented to Kossuth at Pittsburg, Pa., January 26, by Hon. Erastus\r\nHopkins, then a member of the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nKossuth's first speech in New England was made at New Haven, Thursday,\r\nApril 22.  From what he there said some inferences may be drawn as to\r\nhis religious opinions and the basis on which, to him, the principles\r\nof freedom seemed to rest:\r\n\r\n\"I know that there is one God in Heaven, the Father of all humanity,\r\nand Heaven is therefore one.  I know that there is one sun in the sky,\r\nwhich gives light to all the world.  As there is unity in God, and\r\nunity in the light, so is there unity in the principles of freedom.\"\r\n\r\nUpon his arrival in Boston, April 27, 1852, I met with him on the\r\nsteps of the State House, greeting him with the following speech:\r\n\r\n\"Governor Kossuth:  As the voice of the Legislature and people of\r\nMassachusetts, I welcome you to this capitol to-day.\r\n\r\n\"Your presence brings before us our own past, bitter in its experience,\r\nbut glorious in its history.  We once had apostles of liberty on\r\nwhose heads a price was set, who were hunted by tyranny from their\r\nhomes, and threatened with expulsion from civilized life.  That day of\r\noppression and anxiety with us is ended.  It introduced a contest for\r\nhuman rights, whose results on this continent you have seen, in the\r\nextent, character and power of the American republic.\r\n\r\n\"The people of Massachusetts, inspired by their early history and\r\nanimated by the impulses of their hearts, greet you as one who has\r\nnobly served and suffered in the cause of individual freedom and the\r\nrights of states.  Nor will their admiration be limited by any\r\nconsideration arising from the fate of your country, or the failure of\r\nthe patriotic hopes with which it was inspired.\r\n\r\n\"Liberty can never die.  The generations of men appear and pass away,\r\nbut the principles and aspirations of their nature are immortal.\r\n\r\n\"Despotism is of time.  It contains within itself the elements and the\r\nnecessity of decay and death.\r\n\r\n\"Fifty years of your eventful life are past; but take courage, sir, in\r\nthe belief that, in the providence of God, the moment is near when the\r\nlight of freedom shall penetrate the darkness of European despotism.\r\nThen shall your own Hungary welcome you to her fields and mountains, to\r\nher homes and heart; and we will welcome Hungary to the family of\r\nrepublican, constitutional, sovereign states.\r\n\r\n\"In the name of the people, I tender to you the hospitalities of a\r\ncommonwealth founded by Exiles and Pilgrims.\"\r\n\r\nTo this welcome to the capitol of Massachusetts, Kossuth replied as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"I feel deeply sensible of the immense benefit which a happy and\r\nprosperous people has conferred upon an unfortunate people.  Moments\r\nlike the present can only be felt, not spoken.  I feel a deep emotion,\r\nsir.  I am not ashamed of it.  Allow me to say that, in taking that\r\nhand, the hand of the people of Massachusetts, and having listened in\r\nyour voice to the sentiments and feelings of the people of\r\nMassachusetts, I indeed cannot forbear to believe that humanity has\r\narrived at a great turning point in its destinies, because such a\r\nsight was never yet seen on earth.\r\n\r\n\"Conquerors, triumphant and proud of success, confer honors and glory\r\non a poor exile, having nothing to speak for him but his misfortunes.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, the spirit of liberty is lasting; liberty cannot die, because it\r\nhas become the common sentiment of all humanity.  The spirit of liberty\r\ntakes itself wings,--you are happy to be the first-born son of that\r\nspirit; but we accept our condition just to be one of its martyrs; and\r\nI look with hope, I look with confidence, into the future, because that\r\nspirit which prepared for the poor exile the present day will be\r\nrecorded in the records of history, and will mark the destiny of coming\r\ncenturies.  I cannot speak further.  I am proud to have your hands in\r\nmine.\r\n\r\n\"And be sure, sir, and let your generous people be sure of it, that,\r\nwhatever be our future destiny, we shall never, in our struggles and\r\nmisfortunes and adversities, we shall never forget the generous\r\nGovernor of Massachusetts, and the generous people of Massachusetts,\r\nand they shall never have reason to regret that we have been honored\r\nin this immense nation.  God Almighty bless you, sir, and bless you all!\r\n\r\n\"I take these honors proudly, because I take them not for myself, but\r\nin the name of my people, in whose name I express my most humble, my\r\neternal thanks.\"\r\n\r\nKossuth's visit to New England was confined, I think, to the States of\r\nMassachusetts and Connecticut.  He spoke at Hartford, at Springfield,\r\nNorthampton, Worcester, Lynn, Salem, Lowell, Fall River, Plymouth,\r\nLexington and Concord, received everywhere by enormous crowds, and\r\nrousing everywhere an unexampled enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nDuring his stay in Massachusetts he was introduced to audiences by\r\ndistinguished men, some of whom had achieved no inconsiderable\r\nreputation as orators, and in most instances they were stimulated and\r\nadvanced rather then dwarfed by the presence of one whose powers were\r\nfar above the reach of ordinary speakers.  Of these it is not invidious\r\nto mention Emerson, Banks, Burlingame, Hopkins and Kellogg.\r\n\r\nOf the many who spoke in the presence of Kossuth there was no one whose\r\nwords were more acceptable than were those of the venerable Josiah\r\nQuincy.  He was then eighty years of age.  At the banquet in Faneuil\r\nHall he made a ten minutes' speech that glowed with the fire of youth.\r\nIts spirit can be exhibited in a quotation of two short sentences:\r\n\"Age chills the feelings, and renders the heart cold; but I have still\r\nfeeling enough left to say to the hero of the Old World, Welcome to the\r\nliberty of the New!  I can say to the hero of Hungarian liberty,\r\nWelcome to the peace and happiness of our western home.\"  At the\r\ncommencement of his speech Kossuth said:  \"Before all, let me express a\r\nword of veneration and thanks to that venerable gentleman\" (pointing to\r\nMr. Quincy).  \"Sir, I believe when you spoke of age cooling the hearts\r\nof men, you spoke the truth in respect to ordinary men, but you did\r\nyourself injustice.  The common excitement and warm blood of youth\r\npass away; but the heart of the wise man, the older it grows the\r\nwarmer it feels.\"  It is difficult to imagine a more graceful impromptu\r\nrecognition of words of praise.\r\n\r\nKossuth's speech at Bunker Hill, more than his other speeches in New\r\nEngland, bears marks of its Oriental origin.  Pointing to the monument\r\nhe said:  \"My voice shrinks from the task to mingle with the awful\r\npathos of that majestic orator.  Silent like the grave, and yet\r\nmelodious like the song of immortality upon the lips of cherubim, . . .\r\nand thus it speaks:  'The day I commemorate is the rod with which the\r\nhand of the Lord has opened the well of liberty.  Its waters will flow;\r\nevery new drop of martyr blood will increase the tide; it will overflow\r\nor break through.  Bow, and adore, and hope.'\"  In the course of his\r\nremarks he mentioned Gridley, Pollard, Knowlton and Warren, but he\r\nappears not to have heard of Putnam and Prescott.\r\n\r\nAt Lexington he said he was inclined to smile at the controversy with\r\nConcord, declaring that it was immaterial whether the fire of the\r\nBritish was first returned at Lexington or Concord; that its was\r\nimmaterial whether those who fell at Lexington were \"butchered martyrs,\r\nor victims of a battle-field.\"\r\n\r\nKossuth was presented to Amariah Preston, aged ninety-four years, and\r\nto Abijah Harrington, aged ninety-one years, veterans of the\r\nRevolutionary war, and to Jonathan Harrington, then ninety-four years\r\nof age, and the only survivor in Lexington of the action of April 19,\r\n1775.\r\n\r\nAt Concord, Emerson said to the exile:  \"There is nothing accidental in\r\nyour attitude.  We have seen that you are organically in that cause you\r\nplead.  The man of freedom, you are also the man of fate.  You do not\r\nelect, but you are elected by God and your genius to your task.  We do\r\nnot, therefore, affect to thank you.\"\r\n\r\nIn his reply Kossuth appealed to Emerson to give to him and to his\r\ncause the aid of his philosophical analysis, and to impress the\r\nconviction upon the public mind that the Revolution, of which Concord\r\nwas the preface, was full of a higher destiny,--of a destiny as broad\r\nas the world, as broad as humanity itself.\r\n\r\nIn that speech he anticipated Matthew Arnold in the remark, \"One thing\r\nI may own, that it is, indeed, true, everything good has yet been in\r\nthe minority; still mankind went on, and in going on to that destiny\r\nthe Almighty designed, when all good will not be confined to the\r\nminority, but will prevail amongst all mankind.\"  His speech at Concord\r\nwas not of his best, and there are indications that his estimate of\r\nEmerson's supremacy as a philosopher and thinker subjected him to a\r\ndegree of restraint which he could not overcome.\r\n\r\nOnly once, as far as I know, did Kossuth speak of himself, except as\r\nthe chosen and legitimate representative of down-trodden Hungary, and\r\nthat was in his parting speech in Faneuil Hall, May 14, 1852:  \"Some\r\ntake me here for a visionary.  Curious, indeed, if that man who, a\r\npoor son of the people, has abolished an aristocracy of a thousand\r\nyears old, created a treasury of millions out of nothing, an army\r\nout of nothing, and directed a revolution so as to fix the attention\r\nof the whole world upon Hungary, and has beaten the old, well-provided\r\npower of Austria, and crushed its future by its very fall, and\r\nforsaken, abandoned, alone, sustained a struggle against two empires,\r\nand made himself in his very exile feared by czars and emperors, and\r\ntrusted by foreign nations as well as his own,--if that man be a\r\nvisionary therefor, so much pride I may be excused, that I would like\r\nto look face to face into the eyes of a practical man on earth.\"\r\n\r\nIn closing so much of my review of Kossuth's sojourn in Massachusetts\r\nas relates to the incident of his visit to Boston and the neighboring\r\ncities and towns, I may be permitted to devote a few lines to my\r\nacquaintance with him.  To my position as Governor of the State, to the\r\nparagraph in my address to the Legislature, to my letter of invitation,\r\nand to my speech of welcome from the steps of the State House, he gave\r\nmuch more consideration than was deserved; and on many occasions I\r\nreceived evidences of his friendship and confidence.\r\n\r\nI class Kossuth among the small number of great men, whether he be\r\nclassed among orators, philosophers, students of history and\r\ngovernment, or as an advocate of the largest range of individual\r\nfreedom that is consistent with the good order of society.\r\n\r\nThe great orators have appeared and the great orations have been\r\ndelivered in revolutionary periods; and this has been illustrated most\r\nstrikingly when states have been menaced by the fear of transition from\r\na constitution of freedom to a government of tyranny.  Of the great\r\norations of this class, the most significant are the orations of\r\nDemosthenes in behalf of the imperiled liberties of Greece, and the\r\norations of Cicero in defence of his character and of his conduct in\r\nthe public service, and in denunciation of the crimes by which the\r\nRepublic of Rome was transformed into the Empire of the Caesars.  In\r\nmodern times attention may be directed to the speech of James Otis on\r\nthe Writs of Assistance, to Burke's speech on Conciliation with\r\nAmerica, to Fisher Ames' speech on the Jay Treaty, and to Webster's\r\nspeech on Nullification.\r\n\r\nIn all these speeches, the ancient and modern alike, with the\r\nexception of the speech of Fisher Ames, the inspiring, the controlling\r\nsentiment is the sentiment of patriotism,--the claim to continued\r\nindependence and sovereignty in an existing condition, and the claim\r\nto independence and sovereignty on the part of an aspiring people.\r\nBurke was animated by a sense of patriotic duty to Britain and by a\r\nsense of justice to her colonies in America.  Fisher Ames'\r\nargumentative speech was an appeal to the sense of justice of the\r\nHouse of Representatives.\r\n\r\nOf the speeches to which reference has been made, it is to be said that\r\nthe circumstances in which they had their origin were local, although\r\nthey may have embraced the affairs of an empire.  In the main, the\r\nconsiderations advanced were temporary in their relations to the\r\naffairs of mankind.  In its very nature patriotism is local, and the\r\nconsiderations by which the sentiment is stimulated relate usually to\r\nthe conditions and events in the country where the sentiment is\r\nevolved.  Moreover, a manifestation of the sentiment of patriotism in\r\none people is accompanied usually with a degree of hostility to some\r\nother community or nation, and in its excesses it often fosters a\r\ndisregard for the just rights of others.  Nor is the sentiment or\r\nsense of justice usually universal in its application.  As it is\r\nmanifested in individuals and communities, it too often embodies a\r\ndegree of selfishness, from which neither states nor individuals are\r\nexempt.\r\n\r\nIn like manner the words \"freedom\" and \"liberty,\" in their application,\r\nhave been limited to classes and castes, and to individual communities\r\nand states.  The earliest and best expression of the universality of\r\nthe idea of liberty belongs to America, but in America even its\r\npractical realization is a recent event.  Previous to the nineteenth\r\ncentury, America was the only land in which it was possible to found a\r\nstate freed from the domination of the church, or to establish a church\r\nfree from the domination of the state; and in one half of the American\r\ncontinent this degree of freedom does not exist even now, when we\r\napproach the twentieth century.\r\n\r\nOf the great orators of the world, it was Louis Kossuth who first gave\r\nto the word \"liberty\" the largest possible signification.  Burke\r\napproached the idea, but he seemed not to comprehend its universality.\r\nIn his oration on Conciliation with America he said:  \"In Virginia and\r\nthe Carolinas they have a vast multitude of slaves.  When this is the\r\ncase in any part of the world, those who are free are by far the most\r\nproud and jealous of their freedom.  Freedom is to them not only an\r\nenjoyment, but a kind of rank and privilege.  Not seeing, then, that\r\nfreedom as in countries where it is a common blessing, and as broad and\r\ngeneral as the air, may be united with much abject misery, with all the\r\nexterior of servitude, liberty looks among them like something that is\r\nmore noble and liberal.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough Burke speaks of countries where freedom was a common blessing,\r\nit is apparent that the expression was a figure of speech rather than a\r\nstatement of existing facts.  Kossuth came to the Western World, not as\r\nthe exponent merely of the sufferings and wrongs endured by the people\r\nof Hungary, but he announced and advocated boldly the most advanced\r\ntheories of individual and national freedom, and of the mutuality of\r\nthe obligations resting upon states.\r\n\r\nOf the many speeches made by Kossuth in the United States, precedence\r\nmay be given to his speech in Faneuil Hall, April 29, 1852.  In that\r\nspeech he announced in all its fulness his comprehensive idea of\r\nliberty:  \"Cradle of American Liberty! it is a great name; but there\r\nis something in it which saddens my heart.  You should not say\r\n_American liberty._  You should say _Liberty in America._  Liberty\r\nshould not be either American or European,--it should be just\r\n_liberty_.  God is God.  He is neither America's God nor Europe's God;\r\nhe is God.  So should liberty be.  'American liberty' has much the\r\nsound as if you would say 'American privilege.'  And there is the\r\nrub.  Look to history, and when your heart saddens at the fact that\r\nliberty never yet was lasting in any corner of the world, and in any\r\nage, you will find the key of it in the gloomy truth that all who were\r\nyet free regarded liberty as their privilege, instead of regarding it\r\nas a principle.  The nature of every privilege is exclusiveness, that\r\nof a principle is communicative.  Liberty is a principle,--its\r\ncommunity is it security,--exclusiveness is its doom.  What is\r\naristocracy?  It is exclusive liberty; it is privilege; and aristocracy\r\nis doomed, because it is contrary to the destiny and welfare of man.\r\nAristocracy should vanish, not _in_ the nations, but also from\r\n_amongst_ the nations.  So long as that is not done, liberty will\r\nnowhere be lasting on earth . . . A privilege never can be lasting.\r\nLiberty restricted to one nation never can be sure.  You may say, 'We\r\nare the prophets of God'; but you shall not say, 'God is only _our_\r\nGod.'  The Jews have said so, and the pride of Jerusalem lies in the\r\ndust.\"\r\n\r\nThrough all his speeches the thought of the universality of liberty,\r\nand the doctrine that there is a community in man's destiny, can be\r\ndiscerned.  His later speeches, and especially his speeches made after\r\nhis tour through the South, indicate a loss of confidence in the\r\ndisposition of the country to give substantial aid to the cause of\r\nHungary, and thenceforward the loss of hope was apparent in his\r\nconversation and speeches.  Indeed, before he left the country, his\r\nthoughts were directed most largely to the care of his mother, wife\r\nand sisters, who, like himself, were exiles and destitute of the means\r\nof subsistence.  It is not probable that he anticipated at any time\r\nany other assistance than that which might follow an official\r\nannouncement by the national authorities of an opinion adverse to\r\ninterference by any state in the affairs of other states.  His visit\r\nto Washington satisfied him that no such expression of opinion would\r\nbe made by Congress, or by the administration of President Fillmore.\r\n\r\nOn the thirtieth day of April, 1852, Kossuth closed a speech in\r\nFaneuil Hall, which had occupied two hours and a half in its delivery,\r\nwith these words:  \"I cannot better express my thanks than to pledge my\r\nword, relying, as I have said on another occasion of deep interest,\r\nupon the justice of our cause, the blessing of God, iron wills, stout\r\narms and good swords, and upon your generous sympathy, to do all in my\r\npower with my people, for my country, and for humanity.\"  Thus, as he\r\napproached the end of his career in America, he abandoned the thought\r\nof securing active interference, or, indeed, of official support in\r\nbehalf of Hungary, whatever might have been his hopes when he landed\r\nin the United States.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of Kossuth's visit, from December, 1851, to June,\r\n1852, the attention of the country was directed to the approaching\r\nPresidential election, and in public speeches and in conversations\r\nhe attributed his failure to secure the endorsement of Congress and of\r\nlegislative assemblies to that circumstance.  In his first speech in\r\nFaneuil Hall he said, \"Would it had been possible for me to have come\r\nto America either before that contest was engaged, or after it will be\r\ndecided!  I came, unhappily, in a bad hour.\"  That Kossuth attributed\r\ntoo much importance to that circumstance, there can be no doubt.\r\nOther, deeper-seated and more adverse causes were at work.  The advice\r\nand instructions of Washington as to the danger of entangling foreign\r\nalliances were accepted as authority by many, and as binding traditions\r\nby all.  Consequently, there was not, and could not have been, any time\r\nin the century when his appeal would have been answered by an\r\naggressive step, or even by an official declaration in behalf of his\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nCo-operating with this general tendency of public opinion, there\r\nexisted a latent sentiment in the slave States and everywhere among\r\nthe adherents and defenders of slavery that the mission of Kossuth was\r\na menace to that peculiar institution.  Of this face he was convinced\r\nby his visit to Washington and his brief tour in the slave States.  At\r\nWorcester a man in the crowd had shouted, \"We worship not the man, but\r\nwe worship the principle.\"  The slave-holders were interested in the\r\nman, but they feared his principles; and well they might fear his\r\nprinciples for he was the avowed enemy of all castes and all artificial\r\ndistinctions among men.  Hence it was that he was avoided by the\r\nleaders of the Democratic Party, and hence it was that his special\r\nfriends and supporters were Abolitionists, Free-soilers and Anti-\r\nslavery Democrats.\r\n\r\nThis condition of public opinion and of party division was reached as\r\nearly as the twenty-ninth day of April, when Kossuth said:  \"Many a man\r\nhas told me that if I had not fallen into the hands of the\r\nAbolitionists and Free-soilers, he would have supported me; and had I\r\nlanded somewhere in the South, instead of New York, I would have met\r\nquite different things from that quarter; but being supported by the\r\nFree-soilers, of course I must be opposed by the South.\"  All this was\r\nerror.  If Kossuth had been spurned by the Abolitionists and Free-\r\nsoilers, he would not have been accepted by the South; for there was\r\nnot a _quadrennium_ from 1832 to 1860 when that section would have\r\ncontributed to the election of Thomas Jefferson to the Presidency with\r\nthe weight of the Declaration of Independence upon his shoulders, as it\r\ncame from his pen, had he been in existence and eligible to the office.\r\n\r\nSupport of Kossuth, by aggressive action of by official declarations\r\nagainst Austria and Russia, was an impossibility for the country; and\r\nan open avowal of sympathy with his opinions and principles was an\r\nimpossibility for the South or for the Democratic Party.\r\n\r\nHenceforward Kossuth's hopes were limited to pecuniary aid for himself\r\nand his family and friends, and to expressions of sympathy for his\r\ndowntrodden country by individuals, by voluntary associations, and by\r\nmunicipalities.  All his speeches after his visit to Washington were\r\nladen with one thought, viz., the duty of all free countries to resist\r\nthe spread of absolutism.  Pre-eminently this duty was upon America.\r\n\"Republican America,\" said he, \"and all-overwhelming Russian\r\nabsolutism cannot much longer subsist together on earth.  Russia\r\nactive,--America passive,--there is an immense danger in the fact; it\r\nis like the avalanche in the Alps, which the noise of a bird's wing\r\nmay move and thrust down with irresistible force, growing every moment.\"\r\n\r\nHe quoted the declaration which the elder Cato made whenever he spoke,\r\nwhether in private or in public:  \"However, my opinion is that Carthage\r\nmust be destroyed.\"  Imitating the language and spirit of Cato, Kossuth\r\nsaid:  \"However, the law of nations should be maintained, and\r\nabsolutism not permitted to become permanent.\"\r\n\r\nThat he exaggerated the scope of what is called the law of nations\r\nthere can be no doubt.  Beyond a few points, such as the recognized\r\nrule in regard to piracy, the law of nations is very indefinite, and\r\nmost certainly it has but little relation, if indeed it can be said\r\njustly to have any relation, to what he called \"absolutism.\"  Moreover,\r\nit is very doubtful whether any interference by one nation in the\r\naffairs of another nation, in whatever considerate way such\r\ninterference might by presented, could produce aught but evil, in\r\narousing the passions of jealously and hostility.  Had England and the\r\nUnited States tendered any advice even in the affairs of Austria,\r\nHungary and Russia, such advice would have been rejected by the\r\nnations, and indignities would have been heaped upon the officious\r\nparties.  All that part of Kossuth's mission to England and the United\r\nStates was hopeless from the beginning, and it seems to be an\r\nimpeachment of his wisdom to assume that he ever entertained the\r\nthought that either country could or would make the cause of Hungary\r\nits own, whatever might be the general or official opinion as to the\r\njustice of the contest that Hungary had carried on.\r\n\r\nHis speeches and his private conversations justify the inference that\r\nhe had a hope that in some way the influence of England and the United\r\nStates might be exerted effectually in behalf of Hungary, and that\r\nthrough that influence the activity of Russia might be arrested.\r\nAlthough he looked to France for aid to the cause of Hungary, he\r\nregarded the _coup d'etat_ of Napoleon as an adverse event,--as a step\r\nand an important step in the direction of \"absolutism.\"  On one\r\noccasion he said:  \"Look how French Napoleonish papers frown\r\nindignantly at the idea that the Congress of the United States dared to\r\nhonor my humble self, declaring those honors to be not only offensive\r\nto Austria, but to all the European powers.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Webster delivered a speech in Boston in the month of November,\r\n1849, when it was apprehended that Russia might assume the task of\r\ndemanding of Turkey the surrender of Kossuth and others, and of\r\nexecuting them for crimes against Austria.  On that occasion Mr.\r\nWebster claimed that the Emperor of Russia was \"bound by the law of\r\nnations\"; and to that declaration Kossuth often referred.  The full\r\ntext of Mr. Webster's speech leaves upon the mind the impression that\r\nwhat he then called \"the law of nations\" was only that general judgment\r\nof the civilized nations before which the Czar of Russia \"would stand\r\nas a criminal and malefactor in the view of the public law of the\r\nworld.\"  Having this declaration in mind, Kossuth said:  \"It was a\r\nbeautiful word of a distinguished son of Massachusetts (Mr. Webster),\r\nwhich I like to repeat, that every nation has precisely the same\r\ninterest in international law that a private individual has in the laws\r\nof his country.\"  Mr. Webster's speech did not justify the inference\r\nwhich Kossuth drew from it; but the speech itself was much less\r\nreserved than that which Mr. Webster delivered in 1852, when he held\r\nthe office of Secretary of State, and spoke for the administration,\r\nat a banquet given in the city of Washington in Kossuth's honor.\r\n\r\nWhen Kossuth had abandoned the hope, which his intense interest in the\r\nfate of his country had inspired, that the United States might act in\r\nbehalf of Hungary, he yet returned again and again to the subject.  On\r\none occasion he said;  \"I take it for an axiom that there exist\r\ninterests common to every nation comprised within the boundaries of\r\nthe same civilization.  I take it equally for certain that among these\r\ncommon interest none is of higher importance than the principles of\r\ninternational law.\"  Nor did he hesitate to say that our indifference\r\nto the spread of \"absolutism\" would be attended with serious and\r\ngrievous consequences:  \"To look indifferently at these encroachments\r\nis as much as a spontaneous abdication of the position of a power on\r\nearth.  And that position abandoned, is independence abandoned.\"  He\r\ndeclared that neutrality did \"not involve the principles of\r\nindifferentism to the violation of the law of nations\"; and he\r\nattempted to stimulate the national pride by the declaration that\r\nneutrality was the necessity of weak states, like Belgium and Switzer-\r\nland, whose neutrality was due the rivalry of other powers, and not to\r\ntheir own will.\r\n\r\nThese appeals were in vain, although they were made in language most\r\nattractive, and although the sympathies of the people were sincere and\r\nactive in behalf of Hungary.  His mission was a failure, inasmuch as\r\nneither by argument, by eloquence, nor by sympathy was he able to\r\nsecure an official declaration or promise of a purpose in the national\r\nauthorities to interfere in the affairs of Continental Europe.\r\nKossuth's personal wants and the necessities of his family and friends\r\nwere met by the sale of Hungarian bonds and by voluntary contributions;\r\nbut no substantial aid was given to Hungary in its contest with Austria\r\nand Russia.\r\n\r\nIn his many speeches Kossuth set forth his views upon national and\r\ninternational topics with freedom, and often with great wisdom.  Said\r\nhe on one occasion:  \"I take political economy for a science not\r\nexactly like mathematics.  It is quite a practical thing, depending\r\nupon circumstances; but in certain proceedings a negative principle\r\nexists.  In political economy it is not good for the people that a\r\nprohibitory system be adopted.  Protection may sometimes be of service\r\nto a nation, but prohibition never.\"  Thus did he qualify the claim\r\nof authors and students, who assert that political economy deserves\r\nrank among the sciences, whether exact or speculative, and thus did he\r\nrecognize the protective theory as adapted to the condition of states\r\nwhile in the transition period in the development of the higher\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\nIt was a favorite thought with Kossuth that England would become\r\nrepublican, and that the United States and republican England could\r\nlead the world in civilization and in the work and duty of elevating\r\nthe masses.  His influence in Hungary had been due, in a large measure,\r\nto his active agency in the work of establishing associations for the\r\nadvancement of agriculture, public education, commerce, and the\r\nmechanic arts.  He deprecated the opposition of the Irish in America\r\nto any and every form of alliance with England, and he did not hesitate\r\nto condemn the demand of O'Connell for the repeal of the union between\r\nEngland and Ireland.  Said he:  \"If I could contribute one line more\r\nto the future unity in action of the United States and England, I\r\nshould more aid the Irish than by all exclamations against one or the\r\nother.  With the United States and England in union, the Continent of\r\nEurope would be republican.  Then, though England remained monarchist,\r\nIreland would be more free than it is now.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a singular incident in Kossuth's history, in connection with\r\nIrish affairs, that in one of his speeches he foreshadowed Gladstone's\r\nHome Rule policy,--but upon the basis of a legislative assembly for\r\neach of the three principal countries, England, Scotland and Ireland.\r\nThus did he indicate a public policy for Great Britain that has been\r\naccepted in part by the present government,--a policy that is to be\r\naccepted by the English nation and upon the broad basis laid down by a\r\nforeigner and sojourner, who had had only limited means for observation.\r\n\r\n\"If I were an Irishman, I would not have raised the standard of repeal,\r\nwhich offended the people of England, but the standard of municipal\r\nself-government against parliamentary omnipotence; not as an Irish\r\nquestion, but as a common question to all; and in this movement all\r\nthe people of England and Scotland would have joined, and there now\r\nwould have been a Parliament in England, in Ireland and Scotland.  Such\r\nis the geographical position of Great Britain that its countries\r\nshould be, not one, but united, each with its own parliament, but still\r\none parliament for all.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough forty years have passed without the fulfillment of Kossuth's\r\nprophetic declaration of a public policy, its realization is not only\r\npossible, but probable.  To the American mind, with our experience and\r\ntraditions, such a solution of the Irish question seems easy,\r\npracticable, safe.  We have States larger than Ireland, States smaller\r\nthan Ireland, in which the doctrine of self-government finds a\r\npractical application.  Not free from evils, not free from\r\nmaladministration; but if our States are judged at half-century\r\nintervals, it will appear that they are moving with regular and certain\r\nsteps towards better conditions.  There is not one American State in\r\nwhich the condition of the people in matters of education, in personal\r\nand public morals, in industrial intelligence, in wealth and in the\r\nmeans of further improvement, has not been advanced, essentially, in\r\nthe last fifty years.  If all the apprehensions touching the evils and\r\ndangers of self-government in Ireland were well founded, there is an\r\nassurance in our experience that the people themselves would discover\r\nand apply an adequate remedy.\r\n\r\nKossuth was an orator; and every orator is of necessity something of a\r\nprophet.  He is more than a historian who deals only with the past,\r\nillustrated with reflections, called philosophical, concerning the\r\nevents of the past.  With the orator those events are recalled and\r\nreviewed for encouragement or warning.  The eye of the orator is\r\nturned to the future.  The peroration of Mr. Webster's speech in reply\r\nto Hayne contains a prophetic description of the Civil War as it was\r\nexperienced by the succeeding generation.  Fisher Ames' bold prediction\r\nas to the disposition of convicts to found and to maintain good\r\ngovernment has been realized in the history of Van Diemen's Land.  Said\r\nAmes:  \"If there could be a resurrection from the foot of the gallows,\r\nif the victims of justice could live again, collect together, and form\r\na society, they would, however loath, soon find themselves obliged to\r\nmake justice--that justice under which they fell--the fundamental law\r\nof their state.\"\r\n\r\nNor did the spirit of prophecy desert Kossuth, in regard to Louis\r\nNapoleon.  In 1852 he said:  \"The fall of Louis Napoleon, though old\r\nmonarchial elements should unite to throw him up, can have no other\r\nissue than a republic,--a republic more faithful to the community of\r\nfreedom in Europe than all the former revolutions have been.\"\r\n\r\nHe seemed also to foresee the unity of Italy, although he overestimated\r\nthe tendency there towards republican institutions.  He declared that\r\nAustria studded the peninsula of Italy with bayonets, and that she was\r\nable to send her armies to Italy because Russia guarded her eastern\r\nfrontier.  His residence in Italy for a third of a century was due to\r\nhis admiration for the history of the Italian peoples, and his belief\r\nin the capacity of the Italian races for the business of government.\r\n\"The spirit of republican liberty, the warlike genius of ancient Rome,\r\nwere never extinguished between the Alps and the Faro.\"  He declared\r\nthat every stain upon the honor of Italy was connected with foreign\r\nrule, and that the petty tyrants of Italy had been kept on their\r\ntottering thrones through the intervention of Austria, Germany and\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nAt the end he placed the responsibility for the domination of\r\nabsolutism upon the Continent of Europe to the intervention of\r\nRussia and to her recognized supremacy in war.  He appreciated the\r\nfact that Russia in coalition with Austria or Germany or France was\r\nmore than the equal of the residue of the Continent, whether combined\r\nfor offensive or defensive operations.\r\n\r\nIn the many speeches which Kossuth made in the United States, he\r\nendeavored to impress upon his hearers the conviction that absolutism,\r\nunder which Europe was then groaning, would extend to America.  This\r\nview made a slight impression only.  To the common mind the ocean and\r\nthe distance seemed a sufficient protection.  In the lifetime of\r\nKossuth, absolutism, both in church and state, has lost much of power\r\non the Continent of Europe, while in America it has no abiding place.\r\n\r\nKossuth did not err in his opinion as to the policy of Russia in\r\nEuropean affairs; but that policy never extended to America, even in\r\nthought.  Of that policy Kossuth said:  \"It is already long ago that\r\nCzar Alexander of Russia declared that henceforth governments should\r\nhave no particular policy, but only a common one, the policy of safety\r\nto all governments; as if governments were the aim for which nations\r\nexist, and not nations the aim for which governments exist.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, he came to look upon Russia as the master of all Europe, and\r\nhe sought to impress upon his hearers in America the opinion that the\r\ntime would come when Russia would seek for mastery in the affairs of\r\nthis continent.  This apprehension on his part was not accepted by\r\nany class of his hearers and followers, and the cession of Alaska must\r\nhave quieted the apprehension which had taken possession of Kossuth's\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nIn passing from so much of Kossuth's career in America as relates to\r\nhis public policy and to his views upon public questions, it can be\r\nsaid that he entertained the broadest ideas of personal liberty and of\r\nthe independence and sovereignty of states, coupled with an obligation\r\nbinding all states to protect each and every state from the aggressive\r\naction of any other state.\r\n\r\nIt was his hope that England and the United States would unite, and\r\nby counsel, if not by active intervention, check, and in the end\r\ncontrol, Russia in its manifest purpose to dominate over the Continent\r\nof Europe.  This hope has not been realized.  In no instance have the\r\nUnited States and England co-operated for the protection of any other\r\nstate, and the influence of Russia on the Continent of Europe was\r\nnever greater than it now is.  Manifestly, England is the only\r\nobstacle to the domination of Russia over the Bosphorus.\r\n\r\nIn these forty years, Hungary has gained as a component part of the\r\nAustrian Empire, but, in the ratio of the augmentation of its power,\r\nthe tendency to independence and to a republican form of government\r\nhas diminished.  The demonstrations that followed Kossuth's death\r\nare evidence, however, that his teachings have affected the student\r\nclasses in Hungary, and it is possible that those teachings are\r\ndestined to work changes in Hungary and Italy in favor of republican\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nKossuth's teachings were in harmony with the best ideas that have\r\nbeen accepted in regard to state policy, international relations, and\r\nindividual rights; but he was in advance of his own age and in advance\r\nof this age.  For Europe he was an unpractical statesman, and in\r\nAmerica he demanded what could not be granted.  It does not follow,\r\nhowever, that his labors were in vain.  He aroused the American mind to\r\na higher sense of the power and dignity of the American nation, and he\r\nset forth the influence that England and the United States might exert\r\nin the affairs of the world whenever they should co-operate in an\r\ninternational public policy.  He maintained the cause of universal\r\nliberty.  At West Cambridge Kossuth said:  \"Liberty was not granted\r\nto your forefathers as a selfish boon; your destiny is not completed\r\ntill, by the aid and influence of America, the oppressed nations are\r\nregenerated and made free.\"\r\n\r\nThese words were not wholly visionary, and in these forty years since\r\nthey were uttered some progress has been made.  The empires of Brazil\r\nand France have been transformed into republics, slavery has been\r\nabolished in North and South America, the weak states of Italy have\r\nbeen united in one government, the German Empire has been created, and\r\nall in the direction of popular liberty and with manifest preparation\r\nfor the republican form of government.  Nor can it be said justly that\r\nthere has been a retrograde movement in any part of the world.  These\r\nchanges would have come to pass without Kossuth; but it is to his\r\ncredit that his teachings were coincident with the trend of events,\r\nand they may have contributed to the accomplished results.\r\n\r\nIn 1849 Mr. Webster compared Kossuth to Wycliffe, by the quotation of\r\nthe lines:\r\n\r\n  \"The Avon to the Severn runs,\r\n   The Severn to the sea;\r\n   And Wycliffe's dust shall spread abroad,\r\n   Wide as the waters be.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to form an opinion of Kossuth's place as an orator,\r\nwhen considered in comparison or in contrast with other orators.  He\r\nhad but one central theme, the cause of Hungary, and on that theme he\r\nspoke many hundred times, and never with any offensive or tedious\r\nrepetitions.  In Massachusetts alone he delivered thirty-four speeches\r\nand orations, and it may be said that all of them were carefully\r\nprepared, and most of them were reduced to writing.  His topics were\r\nthe wrongs inflicted upon Hungary, the sufferings endured by his\r\ncountry, the dominating and dangerous influence of Russia in the\r\naffairs of Europe, the duty of England and America to resist that\r\ninfluence, the mission of the government and people of the United\r\nStates to labor for the extension of free institutions and the\r\nblessings of liberty to the less favored nations of the world,--all\r\nmade attractive by references to general, local and personal histories.\r\nAs one test, and a very important test, of the presence of unusual\r\npower, it can be said that no other orator ever made so many acceptable\r\naddresses upon allied topics.\r\n\r\nHis cause did much for him.  For im and for his country there was deep-\r\nseated and universal sympathy.  In his case, with unimportant\r\nexceptions, there were no prejudices, or passions, or principles, or\r\ntraditions, to be overcome.  Our history, whether as exiles, as\r\nrevolutionists, or as pioneers in the cause of freedom, contributed\r\nmaterially to the success of his orations and speeches.  All who heard\r\nhim were astonished at the knowledge of our history, both local and\r\ngeneral, which he exhibited.  When he came to the old Hancock House in\r\nBoston, he mentioned the fact without waiting for information, so\r\ncarefully had he studied the features of the city in advance of his\r\nvisit.  There were three persons in his suite who devoted themselves\r\nto the preparation of his speeches,--Gen. Klapka, Count Pulszky and\r\nMadame Pulszky.  Their knowledge of Kossuth's mind was such that they\r\nwere able to mark the passages in local histories and biographies\r\nthat would be useful to him in his addresses.  Those of his speeches\r\nwhich were prepared were written by these assistants, to whom he\r\ndictated the text.  By their aid he was able to prepare his speeches\r\nwith a celerity that was incomprehensible to the Western mind.\r\n\r\nHis first speech in Boston was delivered the twenty-seventh day of\r\nApril, 1852, the day that he completed his fiftieth year.  When in\r\nprivate conversation I spoke of the circumstance that it was my\r\ngood fortune to welcome him to the State on that anniversary, he said:\r\n\"Yes, it is a marked day; but unless my poor country is saved I shall\r\nsoon wither away and die.\"\r\n\r\nHis voice, whether in public speech or in private conversation,\r\ncommanded sympathy by its tones, even when his words were not\r\ncomprehended.  In his oratory there was exaggeration in statement, a\r\ncharacteristic that is common to orators, but not more strongly marked\r\nin the speeches of Kossuth than in the speeches of those with whom he\r\nmight be compared.\r\n\r\nHis powers of imagination were not extraordinary, and of word painting\r\nhe has not left a single striking example,--not one passage that can be\r\nused for recitation or declamation in the schools.  His cause was too\r\npressing, his manner of life was too serious, for any indulgences in\r\nspeech.  In every speech he had an object in view; and even when he was\r\nwithout hope for Hungary in the near future, he yet announced and\r\nadvocated doctrines and truths on which he relied for the political\r\nregeneration of Europe.  He spoke to propositions,--clearly, concisely,\r\nconvincingly.\r\n\r\nIn one oratorical art Kossuth was a adept; he deprecated all honors to\r\nhimself, and with great tact he transferred them to his country and to\r\nthe cause that he represented:\r\n\r\n\"As to me, indeed, it would be curious if the names of the great men\r\nwho invented the plough and the alphabet, who changed the corn into\r\nflour and the flour into bread, should be forgotten, and my name\r\nremembered.\r\n\r\n\"But if in your expectations I should become a screen to divert, for a\r\nsingle moment, your attention from my country's cause and attract it\r\nto myself, I entreat you, even here, to forget me, and bestow all your\r\nattention and your generous sympathy upon the cause of my downtrodden\r\nfatherland.\"\r\n\r\nKossuth gave rise to just criticism in that he appealed too often and\r\ntoo elaborately to the local and national pride of his audiences.  This\r\ncriticism was applicable to his speeches in England and in America.\r\n\r\nIn every attempt to fix Kossuth's place in the list of historical\r\norators,--and in that list he must have a conspicuous place,--certain\r\nconsiderations cannot be disregarded, viz.:\r\n\r\nFirst, he spoke to England and American in a language that he acquired\r\nwhen he had already passed the middle period of life.  The weight of\r\nthis impediment he felt when he said, \"Spirit of American eloquence,\r\nfrown not at my boldness that I dare abuse Shakespeare's language in\r\nFaneuil Hall.\"\r\n\r\nSecond, we are to consider the amount of work performed in a brief\r\nperiod of time, and the conditions under which it was performed.\r\nBetween the twenty-fifth day of April and the fourteenth day of May,\r\n1852, Kossuth delivered thirty speeches in Massachusetts, containing,\r\non an average, more than two thousand words in each speech, and not a\r\nsentence inappropriate to the occasion.  These speeches were prepared\r\nand written in the intervals between the ceremonial proceedings, which\r\noccurred as often as every day.\r\n\r\nThird, though his theme had many aspects, and these varying aspects\r\nKossuth presented with such skill as to command the attention of his\r\nhearers, yet his theme was always the same,--the wrongs of Hungary.\r\n\r\nOn the twentieth, the twenty-fourth, and the twenty-fifth days of May,\r\n1859, Kossuth delivered speeches in London, Manchester, and Bradford,\r\nEngland.  The Lord Mayor presided at the meeting in London, and the\r\nmeetings one and all were designed to aid the Liberal Party in the\r\nthen pending general election.  Kossuth's visit to England and the\r\npurpose of the visit were due to an arrangement with the Emperor\r\nNapoleon, from which Kossuth was led to expect the liberation of\r\nHungary from the grasp of Austria as one of the essential purposes of\r\nthe war in which France and Austria were engaged.  As the result of an\r\ninterview with the Emperor on the night of the 5th of May, Kossuth\r\nvisited England in aid of the Liberal Party, and in the belief that\r\nthe accession of that party to power would secure the neutrality of\r\nthat country.  Hence the wisdom and the duty of neutrality were the\r\ntopics to which Kossuth devoted himself during his short stay in\r\nEngland.  The Liberal Party triumphed, but the triumph was brief, and\r\nthe disposition of the new ministry was not tested.\r\n\r\nKossuth's speeches of 1859 at the London Tavern, at a meeting presided\r\nover by the Lord Mayor, and at Manchester and at Bradford, present him\r\nat his best.  He had received a pledge from Napoleon that if he could\r\nsecure the neutrality of England, and would organize a Hungarian legion\r\nfor service in the war with Austria, the liberation of Hungary should\r\nbe regarded as a necessary condition of peace.  Such, at least, was the\r\ninterpretation which Kossuth put upon these words of the Emperor,\r\nspoken at the midnight meeting of May 5, 1859:  \"We beg you to proceed\r\nforthwith with your scheme; and be convinced that in securing the\r\nneutrality of England you will have removed the greatest obstacle that\r\nstands in the way of the realization of your patriotic hopes.\"\r\n\r\nIn a preliminary conversation with Prince Napoleon, held at the\r\ninstance of the Emperor, Kossuth had stipulated that the Emperor should\r\npublish a proclamation to the Hungarian nation, announcing his\r\nconfederation with the Hungarians as their friend and ally, and for the\r\npurpose of carrying into effect the Declaration of Independence of\r\n1849.  The obligations assumed by Kossuth were faithfully performed.\r\nGeneral Klapka organized a legion in Italy of four thousand Hungarians.\r\nThe overthrow of the Tory Party in England, which Kossuth had predicted\r\nand promised, was achieved, and thus the neutrality of Great Britain\r\nwas secured.\r\n\r\nKossuth's speeches in England were delivered under the influence of the\r\nhighest incentives by which an orator and patriot could be moved.  With\r\nthe utmost confidence in his ability to perform what he had promised,\r\nhe had pledged his honor for the neutrality of England.  As he then\r\nbelieved, the fate of Hungary was staked upon the fulfilment of that\r\npledge.  Hence it came to pass that his speeches in England in May,\r\n1859, were on a higher plane than the speeches that he delivered in\r\nthe years 1851 and 1852.  At the former period he had no hope of\r\nimmediate relief for Hungary; in 1859 he imagined that the day of the\r\ndeliverance of his country was at hand, and that the neutrality of\r\nEngland was a prerequisite, or at least a coincident condition.\r\n\r\nIt is not too much to say that the following extract from his speech in\r\nthe London Tavern justifies every claim that has been made in behalf of\r\nKossuth as a patriot and an orator:\r\n\r\n\"The history of Italy during the last forty years is nothing but a\r\nrecord of groans, of evergrowing hatred and discontent, of ever-\r\nrecurring commotions, conspiracies, revolts and revolutions, of\r\nscaffolds soaked in the blood of patriots, of the horrors of Spielberg\r\nand Mantua, and of the chafing anger with which the words, 'Out with\r\nthe Austrians,' tremble on the lips of every Italian.  These forty\r\nyears are recorded in history as a standing protest against those\r\nimpious treaties.  The robbed have all the time loudly protested, by\r\nwords, deeds, sufferings, and sacrifice of their lives, against the\r\ncompact of the robbers.  Yet, forsooth, we are still told that the\r\ntreaties of 1815 are inviolable.  Why, I have heard it reported that\r\nEngland rang with a merry peal when the stern inward judge, conscience,\r\nled the hand of Castlereagh to suicide; and shall we, in 1859, be\r\noffered the sight of England plunging into the incalculable calamities\r\nof a great war for no better purpose than to uphold the accursed work\r\nof the Castlereaghs, and from no better motive than to keep the House\r\nof Austria safe?\r\n\r\n\"Inviolable treaties, indeed.  Why, my lord, the forty-four years that\r\nhave since passed have riddled those treaties like a sieve.  The\r\nBourbons, whom they restored to the throne of France, have vanished,\r\nand the Bonapartes, whom they proscribed, occupy the place of the\r\nBourbons on the throne of France.  And how many changes have not been\r\nmade in the state of Europe, in spite of those 'inviolable treaties'?\r\nTwo of these changes--the transformation of Switzerland from a\r\nconfederation of states into a confederated state, and the independence\r\nof Belgium--have been accomplished to the profit of liberty.  But for\r\nthe rest, the distinctive features through which those treaties have\r\npassed is this, that every poor plant of freedom which they had spared\r\nhas been uprooted by the unsparing hand of despotism.  From the\r\nrepublic of Cracow, poor remnant of Poland, swallowed by Austria, down\r\nto the freedom of the press guaranteed to Germany, but reduced to such\r\na condition that, in the native land of Guttenberg, not one square yard\r\nof soil is left to set a free press upon, everything that was not evil\r\nin those inviolable treaties has been trampled down, to the profit of\r\ndespotism, of concordats, of Jesuits, and of benighting darkness.  And\r\nall these violations of the inviolable treaties were accomplished\r\nwithout England's once shaking her mighty trident to forbid them.  And\r\nshall it be recorded in history that when the question is how to drive\r\nAustria from Italy, when the natural logic of this undertaking might\r\npresent my own native country with a chance for that deliverance to\r\nwhich England bade God-speed with a mighty outcry of sympathy rolling\r\nlike thunder from John O'Groat's to Land's End,--that deliverance for\r\nwhich prayers have ascended, and are ascending still, to the Father of\r\nmankind from millions of British hearts,--shall it be recorded in\r\nhistory that at such a time, that under such circumstances, England\r\nplunged into the horrors and calamities of war, nay, that she took\r\nupon herself to make this war prolonged and universal, for the mere\r\npurpose of upholding the inviolability of those rotten treaties in\r\nfavor of Austria, good for nothing on earth except to spread darkness\r\nand to perpetuate servitude?\r\n\r\n\"There you have that Austria in Piedmont carrying on war in a manner\r\nthat recalls to memory the horrors of the long gone-by ages of\r\nbarbarism.  You may read in the account furnished to the daily papers,\r\nby their special correspondents, that the rigorously disciplined\r\nsoldiers of Austria were allowed to act the part of robbers let loose\r\nupon an unoffending population, to offer violence to unprotected\r\nfamilies, to outrage daughters in the presence of their parents, and\r\nto revel in such other savage crimes as the blood of civilized men\r\ncurdles at hearing and the tongue falters in relating.  Such she was\r\nalways--always.  These horrors but faintly reflect what Hungary had\r\nto suffer from her in our late war.  And shall it be said that England,\r\nthe home of gentlemen, sent her brave sons to shed their blood and to\r\nstain their honor in fighting side by side with such a _soldatesca_ for\r\nthose highwayman compacts of 1815 to the profit of that Austria?\"\r\n\r\nWith the treaty of Villafranca, July 11, 1859, Kossuth abandoned all\r\nhope of the independence of Hungary.  There can be no doubt that, from\r\nthe first, Napoleon intended to abandon Kossuth and his cause when he\r\nhad made use of his influence in England and in Italy for his own\r\npurposes.  The armistice and the peace with Austria were inaugurated by\r\nNapoleon; and when, at the last moment, Emperor Francis Joseph raised\r\ndifficulties upon some points in the treaty, Prince Napoleon, who was\r\na party to the conference, threatened him with a revolution in Italy\r\nand in Hungary.  As to Kossuth, his only solace was in the reflection\r\nthat he had stayed the tendency to revolution on the soil of Hungary,\r\nand thus his countrymen had been saved from new calamities.\r\n\r\nThenceforward Kossuth had before him only a life of exile; but he\r\nreserved for his children the right, and he set before them the duty,\r\nof returning to their native land.\r\n\r\nI am giving large space to the visit of Kossuth in the belief that the\r\ncountry is moving away from the doctrines of self-government as a\r\ncommon right of mankind, as they were taught by him and as they were\r\naccepted generally until we approached the end of the nineteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nIn Faneuil Hall Kossuth made these striking remarks.  Addressing\r\nhimself to America, he said:  \"You have prodigiously grown by your\r\nfreedom of seventy-five years; but what are seventy-five years to take\r\nfor a charter of immortality!  No, no, my humble tongue tells the\r\nrecord of eternal truth.  A privilege never can be lasting.  Liberty\r\nrestricted to one nation never can be sure.  You may say 'we are the\r\nprophets of God,' but you shall not say, 'God is only our God.'  The\r\nJews have said so and the pride of Jerusalem lies in the dust!  Our\r\nSaviour taught all humanity to say _'Our Father in Heaven,'_ and his\r\nJerusalem is 'lasting to the end of days.'\"\r\n\r\nHis style was that of a scholar who had mastered the English language\r\nby the aid of books.  His idiomatic expressions were few.  In one of\r\nhis speeches when urging his audience to demand active intervention in\r\nbehalf of Hungary he attempted to use the phrase, \"You should take time\r\nby the forelock.\"  At the last word he came to a dead pause and\r\nsubstituted a twist of his own forelock with his right hand.  He thus\r\ncommanded the hearty cheers of his hearers.  It is probable that the\r\nexpedient was forced upon Kossuth, but the art of a skilled orator\r\nmight have suggested such a device.\r\n\r\nKossuth was small in stature, not more than five feet seven inches in\r\nheight, and weighing not more than one hundred and forty pounds.  His\r\neyes and hair were black, his complexion dark, giving the impression\r\nthat he did not belong to the Caucasian race.  His career was a\r\nmeteoric display in political oratory, such as the world does not often\r\nwitness.  His integrity cannot be questioned, and for more than a third\r\nof a century he submitted to a life of exile rather than accept a home\r\nunder a government which he thought was a usurpation.  He gave to the\r\ncountry new ideas, and his name and fame will be traditional for a long\r\nperiod of time.\r\n\r\nWhen Kossuth was in America he looked upon General Gorgey as a traitor\r\nand he was so regarded by the friends of Hungary generally.  In the\r\nyear 1885, however, a testimonial was presented to General Gorgey by\r\nabout thirty of the survivors of the contest of 1848, in which they\r\nexonerated him from that charge.  General Klapka was among the signers,\r\nbut the name of Kossuth did not appear upon the memorial.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the nineteenth century neither Massachusetts nor any\r\nother State could or would accord to an exile for liberty the reception\r\nthat was given to Kossuth in 1852.\r\n\r\nThe expenses of his reception in Massachusetts, and of the\r\nentertainment of his suite were paid by an appropriation from the\r\npublic treasury.  He was given a public reception by the Governor of\r\nthe State, and a like reception was given to him by each House of the\r\nLegislature in suspended session.\r\n\r\nHe was further honored by a review on Boston Common of a fourth part of\r\nthe organized militia of the commonwealth.  The assemblages of citizens\r\nwere as large in proportion to the population of the State as were ever\r\ngathered upon any other occasion.\r\n\r\nKossuth visited fifteen of the principal cities and towns of the State\r\nand in each of them he delivered one address or more.  His theme was\r\nalways the same, but his variety of argument and illustration seemed\r\ninexhaustible.  At Cambridge he urged the students to so use their\r\npowers as to \"promote their country's welfare and the rights of\r\nhumanity.\"\r\n\r\nThe Legislature adopted a series of resolutions of sympathy and in\r\ncondemnation of Austria and Russia.  The opening resolution was in\r\nthese words:  \"Resolved, That every nation has the right to adopt such\r\nform of government as may seem to it best calculated to advance those\r\nends for which all governments are in theory established.\"  Can this\r\nresolution command an endorsement at the beginning of the twentieth\r\ncentury?\r\n\r\nThe States of Maine, Rhode Island, and Vermont adopted resolutions of\r\nsympathy with Hungary and of arraignment of Austria and Russia.\r\n\r\n[* This chapter was published substantially as it appears here in the\r\n_New England Magazine._  Copyright, 1903, by Warren F. Kellogg.]\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\nTHE COALITION AND THE STATE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION OF 1853\r\n\r\nThe controversy over slavery, which wrought a division in the Whig and\r\nDemocratic parties as early as the year 1848, led to a reorganization\r\nof parties in 1849, under the names of Whig, Democratic, and Free-soil\r\nparties, respectively.  Of these the Whig Party was the largest, but\r\nfrom 1849 to 1853 it was not able to command a majority vote in the\r\nState, and at that time a majority vote was required in all elections.\r\nThere was a substantial agreement between the Democratic and Free-soil\r\nparties upon the leading questions of State politics.  Of these\r\nquestions a secret ballot law and the division of counties for the\r\nelection of senators, and the division of cities for the election of\r\nrepresentatives, were the chief.  Under the law then existing the\r\ncounty of Middlesex, for example, elected six senators, and each year\r\nall were of the same party.  Boston was a Whig city, and each year it\r\nchose forty-six members of the House on one ballot, and always of the\r\nWhig Party.  What is now the system of elections was demanded by the\r\nDemocratic and Free-soil parties.  The change was resisted by the\r\nWhig Party.  In 1849 I was nominated by the Democratic Party for the\r\noffice of Governor, and a resolution was adopted denouncing the\r\nsystem of slavery.  In that year coalitions were formed in counties and\r\nin cities and towns between Democrats and Free-soilers, which\r\ndemonstrated the possibility of taking the State out of the hands of\r\nthe Whig Party, if the coalitions could be made universal.  This was\r\naccomplished in 1850, and in 1851 I became Governor by the vote of the\r\nLegislature, and Mr. Sumner was elected to the United States Senate.\r\nIt was the necessity of the situation that the two offices should be\r\nfilled, and the necessity was not less mandatory that one of the\r\nplaces should be filled by a Democrat, and the other by a member of the\r\nFree-soil Party.  There were expectations and conjectures, no doubt,\r\nbut until the Legislature assembled in 1851 no one knew what the\r\narrangement would be.  I am sure that I had no assurance that either\r\nplace would be assigned to me.  The leaders of the Free-soil Party were\r\nresolute in demanding the place in the Senate, so that their views on\r\nthe subject of slavery might be there set forth, and there were many\r\nDemocrats who preferred the control of the State.\r\n\r\nThe coalition had control of the State for the political years of 1851\r\nand 1852.  An act was passed which provided for a secret ballot, and by\r\nanother act the question of a Constitutional Convention was submitted\r\nto the voters of the State.  In March, 1853, an election was held for\r\nthe choice of delegates.  A majority of the delegates elected were\r\nmembers of the Democratic and Free-soil parties.\r\n\r\nAlthough I had made a resolution to retire from active participation in\r\npolitics at the end of my term as Governor, I was so much committed to\r\nthe objects of the Convention, and so much interested in its success,\r\nthat I could not avoid giving my time to the canvass for the election\r\nof members.  It happened, however, that I gave no attention to my own\r\ntown, and the Whig candidate, John G. Park, was elected.  My defeat was\r\ndue to my action upon the liquor bill, which was enacted at the session\r\nof 1852.  The Legislature passed a prohibitory law, subject to its\r\nratification by the people by the use of the open ballot.  The question\r\nof the secret ballot was one of the prominent questions between the\r\nparties, and at the session of 1851 the coalition had passed an act\r\nrequiring the votes to be deposited in envelopes of uniform character\r\nand to be furnished by the State.  I vetoed the bill upon the ground\r\nthat if the bill was to be submitted to the people the secret ballot\r\nshould be used.  Thereupon the Legislature passed a similar bill\r\nwithout a reference to the people.  The bill was passed by the help of\r\nthe Whig members from Boston, who were in fact opposed to the measure,\r\nand with the design of placing me in an unpleasant position.  Contrary\r\nto their expectation, I signed the bill.  As a temperance man, I could\r\nnot have done otherwise, although I thought it proper to submit the\r\nquestion to the people by the use of the secret ballot.\r\n\r\nMany members of the Democratic Party in Groton were users of liquor,\r\nand they voted for my opponent in the contest for a delegate to the\r\nConvention.  Mr. Park was a Whig, but moderate in his feelings, an\r\nupright man, and a fair representative of the Conservative feeling of\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\nIt was one of the peculiarities of the call for the Convention, that\r\neach constituency could elect a candidate from any part of the State.\r\nThat feature added immensely to the ability of the Convention.  Hon.\r\nHenry Wilson was the candidate of the coalition in the town of Natick,\r\nbut as he was not confident of an election he was a candidate also in\r\nthe town of Berlin.  He was elected in both towns.  Mr. Sumner was\r\nelected in Marshfield, the home of Mr. Webster, Mr. Burlingame was\r\nelected for Northboro, Mr. Hallett for Wilbraham, Mr. R. H. Dana, Jr.,\r\nfor Manchester, and others, not less than ten in all, were elected by\r\ntowns in which they did not live.  This circumstance gave occasion for\r\na turn upon words that attracted much attention at the time.  It came\r\nto be known that Mr. Burlingame had never been in Northboro.  Upon some\r\nquestion, the nature of which I do not recall, Mr. Burlingame made an\r\nattack upon the rich men of Boston, and intimated that their speedy\r\ntransfer to the Mount Auburn Cemetery would not be a public misfortune.\r\nMr. Geo. S. Hillard, in reply, referred to Mr. Burlingame as the\r\n\"member who represented a town he had not seen, and misrepresented one\r\nthat he had seen.\"  Unfortunately for Mr. Hillard he lost the value of\r\nhis sharp rejoinder by a statement in the same speech.  Referring to\r\nBoston, where he was a practising lawyer, he said that he \"would not\r\nstrike the hand that fed him.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the meeting of the Convention in May, Mr. Wilson resigned his\r\nseat for Berlin, and I was unanimously elected in his place.  It was\r\nmy fortune also to represent a town that I had not seen.\r\n\r\nI may mention the fact that my father received a unanimous vote for\r\nthe Convention in Lunenburg, the town of his residence.  There were\r\ntwo other cases of the election of father and son as members of the\r\nConvention.  Marcus Morton and Marcus Morton, Jr.; Samuel French and\r\nRodney French.\r\n\r\nThe two great subjects of debate and of anxious thought in the\r\nConvention were the representative system and the tenure of the\r\njudicial office.  It was my earnest purpose to preserve town\r\nrepresentation and in the debate I made two elaborate speeches.  It was\r\nthen and upon that subject that I encountered Mr. Choate for the first\r\ntime.  He was a supporter, and, of course, the leading advocate of the\r\ndistrict system.  The Convention adhered to town representation in a\r\nmodified form.  The proposition was defeated by the vote of Boston,\r\nwhich gave a majority against the new Constitution of about one\r\nthousand in excess of the negative majority of the entire State.\r\n\r\nMore serious difficulties, even, were encountered in the attempt to\r\nchange the tenure of judges.  No inconsiderable portion of the\r\nConvention favored an elective judiciary.  To that project I was\r\nopposed.  By the co-operation of a number of the members of the\r\ncoalition party with the Whigs the proposition was defeated.  Next,\r\na proposition was submitted by Mr. Knowlton of Worcester, to continue\r\nthe appointment in the Executive Department, limiting the tenure to\r\nseven years.  After an amendment had been agreed to extending the term\r\nto ten years, the proposition was adopted.  With some misgivings I\r\nassented to the compromise.  The attempt to change the tenure of the\r\njudges was a grave mistake, and it was the efficient cause of the\r\ndefeat of the work of the Convention.  Beyond this error, the defeat of\r\nthe new Constitution was made certain by the course of Bishop\r\nFitzpatrick of the Catholic Church.  For many years the Irish\r\npopulation of Boston had acted with the Democratic Party.  Upon the\r\nquestion of calling a Convention the adverse majority in Suffolk had\r\nbeen 2,800 only, but upon the question of ratifying the work of the\r\nConvention the adverse majority was nearly six thousand.  To this\r\nresult the influence of Bishop Fitzpatrick had contributed essentially.\r\nHis reason he did not disguise.  Portions of Boston were under the\r\ncontrol of the Irish.  A division of the city would open to them seats\r\nin the House and the Senate.  The Bishop deprecated their entrance\r\ninto active, personal politics.  Hence he used his influence against\r\nthe new Constitution.  Such was his frank statement when the contest\r\nwas over.\r\n\r\nAbout the twentieth of June, when I had been a member of the Convention\r\nfor twenty days only, General Banks said to me that it was the wish of\r\nour friends that I should move for a committee to prepare the\r\nConstitution for submission to the people.  At that time the thought of\r\nsuch a movement had not occurred to me.  The committee was appointed\r\nupon my motion, and, according to usage, I was placed at the head of\r\nit, and from that time I had in my own hands, very largely, the\r\ndirection of the business of the Convention.  As is usual, the work of\r\nthe committee fell upon a few members.  In this case the working\r\nmembers were Richard H. Dana, Jr., and myself.  Marcus Morton, Jr., a\r\nvolunteer, was a valuable aid.  After considerable experience in other\r\nplaces I can say that the preparation of the new Constitution was the\r\nmost exacting labor of my life.  The committee were to deal with the\r\nConstitution of 1780, with the thirteen amendments that had been\r\nadopted previous to 1853, and with thirty-five changes in the\r\nConstitution that had been agreed to by the Convention.  The practical\r\nproblem was this:--\r\n\r\n(1)  To eliminate from the Constitution of 1780 all that had been\r\nannulled by the thirteen amendments.\r\n\r\n(2)  To eliminate from the Constitution of 1780, and from each of the\r\nthirteen amendments, all the provisions that would be annulled by the\r\nadoption of the thirty-five changes that had been agreed to by the\r\nConvention.\r\n\r\n(3)  To furnish Constitutional language for the new features that were\r\nto be incorporated in the Constitution.\r\n\r\n(4)  To arrange the matter of the new Constitution, and to reproduce\r\nthe instrument, divided upon topics and into chapters and articles.\r\n\r\nAll the work under the first two heads was done by myself.  The\r\nlanguage was so much the subject of criticism and of rewriting that\r\nthe responsibility for item three cannot be put upon any one.  The\r\nsame may be said of the work under item four; although that work was\r\nunimportant comparatively.  The copy of the Constitution which was\r\nused by me in making the eliminations is still in my possession.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed that the Convention did not furnish language in\r\nwhich the amendments that had been agreed to were to be expressed in\r\nthe Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions, as adopted, were in the form following:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That it is expedient so to alter and amend the Constitution\r\nas to provide for a periodical division of the Commonwealth into equal\r\ndistricts on the basis of population.\"  This form was observed in all\r\nthe results reached by the Convention.  The Convention had named the\r\nfirst day of August as the day of adjournment, and the serious work of\r\npreparing the Constitution was entered upon about the 15th day of July.\r\nThe committee as a body, consisting of thirteen members, took no part\r\nin the preparation of the Constitution.  It sanctioned the work as it\r\nhad been done by Mr. Dana, Mr. Morton, and myself.\r\n\r\nAs my constant presence in the Convention was required, the work\r\nimposed upon me as chairman of the committee was performed in the\r\nmornings, in the evenings, and during the recesses.  Thus the days from\r\nthe early morning until ten o'clock at night were given to labor and\r\nwithout thought of eating or drinking.  At ten o'clock I ate a hearty\r\nsupper and then retired, always getting a sound sleep, whatever might\r\nhave been the work of the day preceding.\r\n\r\nIn the last fifteen days of the session the _projet_ of the\r\nConstitution was printed for proof-reading and for corrections twenty-\r\nfour times.  The record shows that there were but few changes made by\r\nthe Convention, and those were formal and unimportant; and never in the\r\ncanvass that followed was the suggestion made that the proposed\r\nConstitution failed to represent the mind and purpose of the Convention.\r\n\r\nThe Address to the People of the State was written by me on the last\r\nday of the Convention, August 1, 1853, and, as I now recall the events\r\nof that day, it was not submitted to the committee, although the\r\nmembers, by individual action, authorized me to make the report.  On\r\nthe same day and upon the motion of Mr. Frank W. Bird, of Walpole, the\r\nConvention adopted the following order:--\r\n\r\n\"Ordered, That the resolves contained in Document No. 128, and the\r\nAddress to the People signed by the president and secretaries, be\r\nprinted in connection with the copies of the Revised Constitution\r\nordered to be printed for distribution; and that thirty-five thousand\r\nadditional copies of said Constitution, with the Resolves and Address,\r\nbe printed for distribution, in accordance with the orders already\r\nadopted.\"  The Convention adjourned at ten minutes before two o'clock\r\non the morning of August 2.  The work as a whole was rejected by the\r\nvoters of the State, but the mind and purpose of the Convention have\r\nbeen expressed during the forty-four years now ended, in the many\r\namendments that have been engrafted upon the Constitution of 1780.\r\n\r\nMy intimate acquaintance with Mr. Choate began in this Convention.\r\nI had known him as early as 1842, when he came to Groton and made a\r\nspeech in defence of the Whig Party.  He was then a member of the\r\nSenate and in the fullness of his powers both intellectual and\r\nphysical.  In 1853 his physical system was impaired, but his intellect\r\nwas as supreme as it had ever been.  When I held the office of Governor\r\nI made a visit to Mr. Choate at his house.  My associate was Ellis Ames\r\nof Canton.  The circumstances were these.  The contest with Rhode\r\nIsland in regard to the boundary line had reached a crisis.  When I\r\ncame to office I found upon the Statute Book a resolution directing the\r\nGovernor to institute legal proceedings for the purpose of fixing the\r\nboundary unless Rhode Island should agree to proceed by a new\r\ncommission.  As Rhode Island had remained silent, I directed the\r\nAttorney-General to execute the statute.  After some time he informed\r\nme that the preparation of the bill involved a good deal of labor and\r\nthat some assistance should be had.  He suggested Ellis Ames who had\r\na reputation as an equity lawyer.  Mr. Ames was employed.  When the\r\nbill was prepared and submitted to me, I found that a claim was made\r\nto five towns that were originally in the Plymouth Colony, but which\r\nby a decree of the King in Council had been set over to Rhode Island\r\nin 1746.  I objected to the presentation of this claim and said that we\r\nshould only ask that the true line should be run agreeably to that\r\ndecree.  Soon after the Revolution the State of Rhode Island ran the\r\nline _ex parte_ and encroached upon the territory of Massachusetts\r\none-fourth to three-fourths of a mile.\r\n\r\nFrom that time both parties had asserted and exercised jurisdiction\r\nwhich had resulted in a number of controversies in the local courts.\r\nThe Attorney-General lived at New Bedford near the line.  The people\r\nwere constantly excited, and Mr. Clifford was unwilling to accept my\r\nproposed amendment.  After some delay he suggested an interview with\r\nMr. Choate, who had been counsel for the Town of Fall River in some one\r\nor more of the controversies involving the boundary.  I assented to the\r\nsuggestion, and an evening was fixed for a call upon Mr. Choate by Mr.\r\nAmes and myself.  The evening was a stormy one, but we made our way to\r\nMr. Choate's house.  He was in his library in the second story.  It\r\nconsisted of two rooms that had been connected by making an arch in the\r\npartition.  The shelves were filled, and the floor was covered with\r\nbooks.  Ames said:\r\n\r\n\"Why, Mr. Choate, what a quantity of books you have!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Choate, \"I have a good many books, more than I have\r\npaid for, but that is the book-seller's business, not mine.\"\r\n\r\nAfter some time had been spent in general conversation Ames introduced\r\nthe subject for which we had met, and stated the question of the claim\r\nto the five towns, to which Choate said:\r\n\r\n\"The best way is to go for enough and get what we can.\"\r\n\r\nI made no remark, and the business part of the interview ended.  Before\r\nwe left Mr. Choate ordered a bottle of wine and made the remark:\r\n\r\n\"I keep a little wine in my house, but as for myself, I don't drink a\r\nglass once in a thousand years.\"\r\n\r\nOne's first impressions of Mr. Choate were never disturbed by intimate\r\nacquaintance.  Many distinguished persons become insignificant upon\r\nclose inspection.  With Mr. Choate those who knew him best, estimated\r\nhim most highly.  He had no malice in his nature, and there was a\r\ngenial quality in his sharpest sallies of wit.\r\n\r\nIn the Convention we had end seats.  Mr. Choate occupied the seat\r\nimmediately in front of me.  Thus I had an opportunity for two months\r\nto observe his ways, and to enjoy his conversation.  Great as were his\r\nspeeches, they did not transcend his exhibitions of power in private\r\nconversation.  His great speech in the Convention was upon the\r\nJudiciary System, and his description of a good judge is one of the\r\nfinest paragraphs in oratory, ancient or modern.  His second, or\r\nperhaps his first great work in art is his sketch of Demosthenes in his\r\nlecture on the Eloquence of Revolutionary Periods.  As a specimen of\r\nessay writing it is not surpassed by any passage to be found in Macaulay.\r\n\r\nThe Convention of 1853 was the ablest body of men that ever met in\r\nMassachusetts.  The Convention of 1820 included Mr. Webster, an abler\r\nman than any of the members of the Convention of 1853, but the\r\nConvention as a whole was an inferior body of men.  Mr. Choate was the\r\nfirst man in the Convention of 1853, and he must ever remain one of\r\nthe great characters of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nSimon Greenleaf, the author of the work on Evidence, was a member of\r\nthe Convention, and his influence was considerable.  He was a dry,\r\nhard-headed lawyer.  His influence was due to his reputation rather\r\nthan to his power as a debater.  Had he come to the Convention as an\r\nunknown person, his standing would have been in the second or third class.\r\n\r\nRichard H. Dana, Jr., added to his reputation by his speeches in the\r\nConvention.  His style was free from exaggeration, and he addressed\r\nhimself to the question at issue and always with effect.  My intimate\r\nacquaintance with Mr. Dana began during the session of the Convention.\r\nIn 1854 and 1855 I visited him and his father, the poet, at their home\r\nin Manchester-by-the-Sea.  Mr. Dana, Sr., was a genial man, but\r\nreserved, and not much given to conversation.  My friendship with Mr.\r\nDana continued until General Butler became a candidate for Congress in\r\nthe Essex district, and Mr. Dana became the nominee of the dissenting\r\nRepublicans.  That year I placed myself in the hands of the State\r\nCommittee for a limited number of speeches, and by direction of the\r\nCommittee, I spoke twice in the Essex district in aid of General\r\nButler, who was the regular nominee of the party.  From that time Mr.\r\nDana avoided me, and when we met he addressed me with the coldest\r\nformality.  At a meeting in this canvass held in Gloucester, I combated\r\nthe charge of the Democrats that there had been many and great\r\ndefalcations under Republican rule, and among other things I said the\r\ngreatest defalcation was by a man who had been identified with the\r\nDemocratic Party.  A man in the gallery said:  \"Name him.\"  I answered:\r\n--\"His name is ----.\"  \"Oh,\" said my questioner, \"I don't care anything\r\nabout that!  I didn't know but it was General Butler.\"\r\n\r\nWhen General Grant nominated Mr. Dana for the English mission, I was in\r\nthe Senate, and I endeavored to secure his confirmation.  General\r\nButler appeared as his opponent.  The case at first turned upon his\r\nmanners and his responsibility in the matter of his edition of\r\nWheaton's International Law.  In the suit instituted by Beach Lawrence,\r\nthe Court had found that Dana had violated the copyright of Mr.\r\nLawrence.  I made a careful study of the case, and I flattered myself\r\nthat I had satisfied the Senate that Mr. Dana's offence was merely\r\ntechnical, and that it ought not to interfere with his confirmation.\r\nAt that moment there appeared a letter from Mr. Dana which contained\r\nan attack upon General Cameron, then a member of the Senate, and Mr.\r\nDana's case was rendered hopeless.  He secured his own defeat when his\r\nenemies were powerless to accomplish it.  He was, however, very\r\ngrateful to me for my effort in his behalf.  The result was a heavy\r\nblow to his ambition and he resolved to prepare a new work on\r\nInternational Law.  For that purpose he took his residence in Europe,\r\nbut death came too soon for the realization of his purpose.\r\n\r\nMr. Dana will be remembered by his tale of the sea, \"Two Years Before\r\nthe Mast.\"  He was a learned lawyer, an aristocrat by nature, and a man\r\nof eminent power.   He scorned the opinions of inferior men, and\r\ntherein was the cause of his failure.  By a hair's breadth he failed\r\nof success in all the public undertakings of his life, excepting only\r\nhis tale of the sea.\r\n\r\nMr. Burlingame was then an enthusiastic young man.  He had had some\r\nexperience in public affairs, but it could not have been predicted that\r\nhe would attain the distinction which he achieved subsequently, in the\r\nfield of diplomacy.  He made speeches in the Convention, but they\r\nproduced little or no effect upon the opinions of others.  When, on an\r\noccasion, he had made an elaborate speech, his father-in-law, Mr. Isaac\r\nLivermore, said he was glad it was delivered, as Anson had trodden down\r\nall the roses in the garden while reciting it to himself.  His speeches\r\nwere committed, and delivered without notes.\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner was a conspicuous figure in the Convention of 1853, but his\r\ninfluence upon its business was very limited.  Indeed, he seemed not to\r\naspire to leadership.  His faculties were not adapted to legislative\r\nbusiness.  He was not only not practical, he was unpractical and\r\nimpracticable.  Nor did experience in affairs give him an education in\r\nthat particular.  Of his long career in the Senate only his speeches\r\nremain.  During the period of my acquaintance with him there, he\r\nintroduced a large number of bills, several of them upon matters of\r\nfinance, but none, as far as I can recall them, stood the test either\r\nof logic or experience.  From his seat in the Senate he was able to\r\naffect and perhaps even to control the opinions of the country upon the\r\nslavery question, and thus indirectly he helped to shape the policy of\r\nthe Republican Party.  His knowledge of European diplomacy was far\r\ngreater than that of any other Senator and greater, probably than that\r\nof any other American, excepting only Mr. Bancroft Davis.  It was his\r\ngood fortune to live and act in a revolutionary period.  Had he fallen\r\nupon quiet times, when the ordinary affairs of men and states are the\r\nonly topics of thought and discussion, his career as a public man, if\r\nsuch a career should have been opened to him, would have been brief and\r\nvalueless alike to himself and to the public.  In all his life, he was\r\na victim to authority in affairs, and a slave to note- and common-place\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\nHenry Wilson, Sumner's future colleague in the Senate of the United\r\nStates, had large influence in securing the adoption of measures, but\r\nhis learning was inadequate to the preparation of specific provisions\r\nof a constitution.  Indeed, in his later years, he was unequal to the\r\nwork of composing and writing with even a fair degree of accuracy.  But\r\nhis judgment of the popular feeling was unequalled, and he had capacity\r\nfor shaping public opinion, whenever it was found to be hostile or\r\nuncertain, far superior to that of any of his contemporaries.  He was\r\nnot an orator, but his style of speaking was effective, and his\r\nspeeches, as they appeared in the columns of the newspapers, would bear\r\nthe test of ordinary criticism.  He was a thorough politician who aimed\r\nto have things right, but who would not hesitate to use doubtful\r\nmethods if thereby the right could be attained.  In the year 1854 he\r\njoined the Know Nothing Party in secret, while openly he was acting\r\nwith the Free-soil Party, that had placed him in nomination for the\r\noffice of Governor.  The result was the election of Henry J. Gardner,\r\nthe candidate of the Know Nothings, as Governor, and the election of\r\nHenry Wilson to the Senate of the United States.\r\n\r\nOf Mr. Wilson it cannot be said that he was false to friends or\r\nunfaithful to the slave.  Whatever criticisms may be made upon his\r\ncareer in politics, he kept himself true to the one idea--the overthrow\r\nof slavery.  He often vacillated in opinion upon passing questions, but\r\nat the end his votes were sound usually.  As a consequence, his votes\r\nand speeches were at times inconsistent.  He had a long career in the\r\nSenate, but his great service to the country was performed among the\r\npeople in the canvasses.  It may be said of him that at the time of\r\nhis death he had spoken to more people than any one of his\r\ncontemporaries or predecessors.  His influence was large, although he\r\ndid not often introduce any new view of a public question.  He was\r\ndirect in speech and he comprehended the popular taste and judgment.\r\nHe was regarded as a prophet in politics.  He was accustomed to make\r\npredictions, and not infrequently his predictions were verified.  At\r\nthe end it is to be said that a satisfactory analysis of his character\r\ncannot be made.  He was not learned, he was not eloquent, he was not\r\nlogical in a high sense, he was not always consistent in his political\r\nactions, and yet he gained the confidence of the people, and he\r\nretained it to the end of his life.  His success may have been due in\r\npart to the circumstance that he was not far removed from the mass of\r\nthe people in the particulars named, and that he acted in a period when\r\nfidelity to the cause of freedom and activity in its promotion\r\nsatisfied the public demand.\r\n\r\nFrancis W. Bird had been an active member of the Coalition on the\r\nFree-soil side, and an active supporter of the project for a\r\nConstitutional Convention.  It cannot be said of Mr. Bird that he did\r\nanything so well that one might say \"nobody could have done better,\"\r\nbut his zeal never flagged and hence he did much to secure results.\r\nLike Mr. Wilson, he knew every member, and he never hesitated to set\r\nforth his views.  He always had a following, and in those days it was\r\nsafe to follow him.  In 1872 he became alienated from General Grant\r\nand consequently from the Republican Party.  His influence was\r\npotential with Mr. Sumner, and it is not an over estimate of that\r\ninfluence to assume that he was responsible in a large degree for the\r\ndefection of Mr. Sumner.  Following that election, Mr. Bird became a\r\nmember of the Democratic Party, but upon what ground it is not easy to\r\nconjecture.  His whole life had been a protest against that party, and\r\nmuch of his public career had been directed to its defeat.  During the\r\nwar and the period of reconstruction, he had been its earnest and even\r\nbitter antagonist.  Mr. Bird was a public spirited man, and he was\r\nespecially liberal towards men and causes in whose fortunes or fate he\r\nhad become interested.  Upon the close of the war there was a tendency\r\nin the public mind to advance the successful military men to posts of\r\nhonor and power in civil life.  Some were chosen to the Senate and the\r\nHouse, some were appointed to important diplomatic places, and General\r\nGrant was elected President.  Many of the politicians were disturbed,\r\nand chief among them was Mr. Chase, who allowed the use of his name as\r\na candidate for the Presidency in the Democratic Convention of 1868.\r\nFrom that time many persons who had been conspicuous as anti-slavery\r\nmen before the war, separated from the Republican Party and joined the\r\nDemocracy.  Mr. Bird was one of many such.\r\n\r\nThere were a small number of men who had been members of the Convention\r\nof 1820 who were members of the Convention of 1853.  Of these Mr.\r\nRobert Rantoul, of Beverly, was conspicuous, partly on account of his\r\nage, partly on account of his services and character, and partly as\r\nthe father of Robert Rantoul, Jr.  He was a noticeable figure in the\r\nConvention of 1853.  Mr. Rantoul, Jr., had died at Washington the\r\npreceding year.  His death was a public loss, and especially so to the\r\nanti-slavery wing of the Democratic Party to which he maintained his\r\nallegiance up to the time of his death.  He had, however, taken issue\r\nwith the party upon the Fugitive Slave Act, and for his hostility to\r\nthat measure he was excluded from the Democratic Convention of 1852,\r\nalthough he had been duly elected by the Democrats of the county of\r\nEssex.  There can be no doubt that he would have acted with the\r\nRepublican Party had he lived to the period of its organization.  He\r\nwas one of the three distinguished persons who were born in the county\r\nof Essex early in the century--Cushing, Choate and Rantoul.  In\r\nmasterly ability Choate was the chief, unquestionably.  In the\r\nprofession, neither Cushing nor Rantoul could compare with Choate,\r\nalthough in learning Cushing may have been his rival.  In knowledge of\r\ndiplomacy and international law neither Choate nor Rantoul could be\r\ncompared to Cushing.  In the modern languages he was their superior\r\nalso, although it is probable that in the knowledge of Latin and Greek\r\nhe was inferior to Choate.  In business matters they were alike\r\ndefective.  In Rantoul there was a lack of continuity of purpose.  He\r\nwas guided by his feelings and opinions.  He had the temperament of a\r\nreformer.  Indeed, he was a reformer.  He abhorred slavery, he made\r\nwar upon intemperance, he was an advocate of reform in prison\r\ndiscipline, and he championed the abolition of capital punishment.  In\r\nneither of these movements did Cushing or Choate take an interest.\r\nThey thought slavery an evil, but they had no disposition to attack it.\r\nAlike, they feared unpleasant consequences.  Choate's devotion to the\r\nConstitution was akin to idolatry.\r\n\r\nCushing's support of the Constitution more nearly resembled\r\nprofessional duty.  Indeed, that peculiarity could be discovered in\r\nmuch of his public conduct.  In service to others he was liberal to a\r\nfault.  In conversation, he would make suggestions to politicians and\r\nto lawyers in aid of their views or their causes with great freedom\r\nand without apparent concern as to the effect upon parties or men.\r\nRantoul was not able to fix his attention upon any one branch of labor.\r\nHe was first of all a politician with an interest in social questions.\r\nThe profession of the law was not his mistress.  His arguments were\r\nclear and direct, but they lacked the quality that is near to genius.\r\nThis quality Choate possessed in a degree not elsewhere found in the\r\nlife or history of the American Bar.  Cushing's arguments were loaded\r\nwith learning and heavy with suggestions upon the general subject\r\nrather than upon the case.  This of his law arguments.  As I never saw\r\nhim before a jury I cannot speak of his quality as a _nisi prius_\r\nadvocate; but I cannot imagine that he could have had eminent success,\r\nand certainly he could not have had success, in the later period of his\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\nMr. Rantoul died at the age of forty-seven. Had he lived to take part\r\nin the affairs of the war and of reconstruction, there can be no doubt\r\nthat he would have achieved great distinction.  He had convictions in\r\nwhich Cushing was deficient.  He had courage in civil affairs, which\r\nMr. Choate did not possess.  Of Choate it can be said, that he lived\r\nlong enough to establish his claim to the first place at the American\r\nbar, if he be judged by what he said, and by what he did.  Mr. Cushing\r\nhad a long career.  As to him, there is no room for conjecture.  He\r\nhad great power for acquisition.  As an aid to others less well\r\nequipped his society and counsels were invaluable.  He had a vast fund\r\nof knowledge in law, in history, in diplomacy, and in general\r\nliterature.  It was his misfortune that he early lost the public\r\nconfidence, and it was a continuing misfortune that he never regained\r\nit.  While it cannot be claimed that either of these three persons is\r\nentitled to a place in general history, it may be said with truth,\r\nthat the birth of Cushing, Choate and Rantoul in a single county and\r\nin a single decade was an unusual circumstance in the affairs of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nMr. Robert Rantoul, Sr., as the oldest member, called the Convention to\r\norder and presided until the election of Mr. Banks as president.  His\r\nadministration of the duties of the chair commanded the approval of the\r\nConvention, and that without regard to personal or party feeling.\r\n\r\nThe election of General Pierce to the Presidency in 1852 was fatal to\r\nthe coalition in Massachusetts.  Upon his accession to the office, in\r\nMarch, 1853, General Cushing became Attorney-General of the United\r\nStates, and in the summer or autumn of 1853 he wrote a letter to a\r\ngentleman in Worcester, which was interpreted as a declaration of\r\nhostility on the part of the administration against all Democrats\r\nwho affiliated with Free-soil politicians.  The election of 1852 had\r\nbeen favorable to the Whigs of Massachusetts, but the contest was\r\nfatal to the Whig Party in a national point of view.  That party\r\ndisappeared in the country, and after two elections in Massachusetts,\r\nthat of 1852 and 1853, it ceased to have power in the State.  For many\r\nyears after, there were occasional attempts to revive it, but all such\r\nattempts were vain.  It was led by intelligent and well-disposed men,\r\nbut its principles were not accepted by the country, and it attempted\r\nto secure the recognition of its principles by a policy that was\r\ntemporizing and expedient.  It lacked the courage of the old Democratic\r\nParty.\r\n\r\nUpon the defeat of the Constitution, I turned my attention to the\r\nprofession in the office of Mr. Joel Giles, with whom I had studied.\r\nHe had been a lecturer at Cambridge, a member of the House and the\r\nSenate, and of the Constitutional Convention.  He was a bachelor,\r\neconomical in his expenditures, rigid in his opinions, just in every\r\nthing, and a most careful student and conscientious practitioner.  He\r\nwas a patent lawyer, and as lawyer and mechanic he was the superior of\r\nany other person that I have known.  As an advocate his services were\r\nnot valuable.  He seemed timid, and his style was not adapted to jury\r\ntrials nor to hearings by the court.  However, in patent cases he could\r\nmake himself understood by the court, and he had influence resting upon\r\nthe belief that he was free from deception which was the fact.\r\n\r\nMr. Giles was then attorney for Elias Howe, the inventor of the sewing\r\nmachine.  He had been counsel for Howe from the first, when Howe was in\r\nextreme poverty and unable to pay fees.  In the early stages of the\r\ncontest Mr. Giles conducted the case without present compensation, and\r\nat the end, when Howe's income was enormous for the period, Mr. Giles\r\naccepted only very moderate fees, and he was content therewith.  Mr.\r\nHowe was a peculiar character:  odd in his ways, but generous with his\r\nincome:--so generous that at his death his fortune was very small.  In\r\nmy long acquaintance with Mr. Giles I never knew that he made charges\r\nfor services against any one or that he ever presented a bill, although\r\nhe sometimes spoke of the indifference and neglect of his clients in\r\nthe matter of money.  Some paid and others did not.  Mr. Howe paid all\r\nthat Mr. Giles required, but that was very little compared with the\r\nservice rendered.  The litigation over the Howe patent was severe and\r\nthe questions in a mechanical point of view were nice questions.  Mr.\r\nGiles began with the invention, and he became a master of the case.\r\nMr. Howe was indebted to Mr. Giles for the success of his litigation\r\nwhich established his claim to the invention, secured to him as the\r\nproceeds what might have been an enormous fortune, and placed his name\r\nin the list of the names of great inventors.  The patent-law practice\r\nis the most exhausting branch of the legal profession, and the lawyers\r\nand experts suffer from brain diseases in excess of the average of\r\nsufferers in other branches of the profession.\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\nTHE YEAR 1854\r\n\r\nAt the session of the Legislature, January, 1854, the town of\r\nFitchburg, aided by towns and citizens of the vicinity, petitioned for\r\na new county to be composed of towns to be taken from the counties of\r\nMiddlesex and Worcester and to be called the county of Webster.  Mr.\r\nChoate was retained for the new county, and I appeared for the county\r\nof Middlesex.  The hearing by the committee occupied two weeks or more,\r\nfor an hour or an hour and a half a day.  The fees received seem now to\r\nhave been very small.  It was said that Mr. Choate received the sum of\r\nfive hundred dollars, and my fee was two hundred and fifty dollars.\r\nMr. Choate obtained a favorable report from the committee, but the\r\nproject failed in the Legislature.  It was renewed the succeeding year,\r\nwhen Emory Washburn appeared for the county of Worcester.  In those two\r\ncontests, covering a month of time in all, I had an opportunity to\r\nstudy Mr. Choate in his characteristics as an advocate and as an\r\nexaminer of witnesses, a branch of the profession in which he had great\r\nskill.\r\n\r\nVarious witnesses were called for the purpose of gathering facts as to\r\nthe inconveniences of which complaints were made and also for the\r\npurpose of showing the advantage to be derived from the proposed\r\nchange.  A witness of importance and altogether friendly, was Stuart\r\nJ. Park, of Groton.  He was a Scotchman by birth, his father having\r\nbeen employed upon the Argyle estates.  The father came to America\r\nwhile the son was a minor.  They were by trade stone masons.  Stuart\r\nJ. Park was then nearly seventy years of age.  He had represented the\r\ncounty in the State Senate and for many years he had been a person of\r\nnote, although his education was limited.  He had, however, an\r\nabundance of sound sense and an excess of will power, even for a\r\nScotchman.  In his business he had had a large and successful\r\nexperience.  He was the master builder of the Boston Mill Dam, of the\r\nCharlestown Dry Dock, of the State prison buildings in Massachusetts\r\nand New Hampshire, of the track of the Lowell railway, which was laid\r\noriginally on granite sleepers, and of many jails in New England.\r\nExperience proved that granite sleepers were too firm and sleepers of\r\nwood were substituted.\r\n\r\nOne of the county commissioners was John K. Going of Shirley.  I had\r\nknown him from my youth.  He was my senior by about ten years.  In my\r\nboyhood he called not infrequently at my father's house, driving an\r\nold horse in a second-hand, well worn sulky.  His business was trading\r\nin horses and watches, and gambling, as was reported, for small sums of\r\nmoney.  To myself and my brothers he was held up by my mother as a\r\nwarning.  Before he was twenty-one years of age he had induced his\r\nfather to mortgage his small homestead for four hundred dollars which\r\nJohn lost in unwise or unfortunate ventures.  Upon that experience he\r\nbegan to recover his fortunes.  He became a dealer in better horses,\r\nthen in hops, then in real estate, and to some extent he became an\r\noperator in Boston markets.  At the age of fifty he was worth,\r\nprobably, two hundred thousand dollars.  With the improvement of his\r\nfortunes, his character improved.  He was always temperate and his\r\nagreements were carefully kept.  He made ample provision for his\r\nparents, and for a sister; was a representative in the general court\r\nand for many years he was a capable and acceptable county commissioner.\r\nHe was one of a not numerous class of persons who escape from evil\r\nearly associations and habits of life.\r\n\r\nIn 1854 the Know Nothing Party took possession of Massachusetts.  Its\r\nsecrecy made it attractive to many persons.  Moreover, the then\r\nexisting parties were unsatisfactory to the people.  The Whigs, who had\r\nbeen out of power in 1851 and '52, had regained power, but the vitality\r\nof the party had disappeared forever.  Many of the leaders had joined\r\nthe Free-soil Party, and others were indifferent to its fortunes.  The\r\nDemocratic Party was dissatisfied with the national administration, and\r\nthe Free-soil Party was without hope.  The coalition could not be\r\nrepeated.  In the spring or summer of 1854 General Banks asked me\r\nwhether I intended to join the Know Nothings.  I said No, that I had\r\nleft politics and that I intended to practice law.  He said in reply,\r\n\"I am in politics and I must go on.\"  The success of the Know Nothing\r\nParty was without precedent.  They carried every city and town in the\r\nState, elected all the members of the Legislature, unless there may\r\nhave been an accidental exception, unseated all the members of\r\nCongress, elected Henry J. Gardner Governor by an immense majority,\r\nand elected Henry Wilson to the Senate of the United States.\r\n\r\nMr. Gardner was re-elected in 1855 by the momentum of the party,\r\nalthough it had fallen into discredit which would have led to its ruin\r\nin the face of a vigorous opposition.  The Whig Party had disappeared\r\nand the Republican Party had not reached a period when it could\r\ncommand its forces.  In 1856 the Know Nothing Party was yielding to\r\nthe Republican Party and Governor Gardner was accepted for a third term.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1854 I made a trip to the Adirondack woods and mountains.\r\nThe party was organized by Francis W. Bird, and it consisted of Mr.\r\nBird, Henry W. Pierce, D. W. Alvord, a Mr. Hoyt and myself.  We left\r\nour homes about the 20th of June and were absent about twenty days.\r\nWe entered the woods from Amsterdam, N. Y.  From that place we\r\ntravelled by a wagon to Lake Pleasant, about fifty-four miles.  We\r\nremained there two or three days at a hotel kept by a man named John\r\nC. Holmes, or rather by his wife, while Holmes retailed old stories to\r\nthe few guests.  The chief topic was the large trout caught in the\r\nlake and when and by whom.  The ten largest of the season caught in\r\nLake Pleasant and Round Lake weighed in the aggregate 154-1/2 pounds.\r\nA Mrs. Peters from New York was the champion; her prize having weighed\r\nsomething over 16 pounds.\r\n\r\nWe started for the woods on a Thursday taking with us eight guides, a\r\ndonkey and a considerable quantity of provisions.  As the protection\r\nwas insufficient, the bread, salt, pepper, etc., were soon ruined.  The\r\nsalt pork was saved.  At the end of three or four days we sent the\r\ndonkey and three men back to Lake Pleasant.  On this trip I had my\r\nfirst and indeed my only experience in sleeping on the ground.  At\r\nthe small lakes we found the hunters' camps, which were made by\r\nerecting poles and covering the scanty frame with the bark of cedar trees.\r\n\r\nSaturday night we divided our force as the camp at the lake where we\r\nintended to stop was too small for the accommodation of our whole\r\nparty.  Consequently some of the guides went on about four miles to a\r\nlake where there was another camp of larger size.  Hoyt was the\r\nenthusiast of the party, and it was his ambition to kill a deer,\r\nalthough the inhumane act was prohibited at that season of the year.\r\n\r\nOur leading guide was called Aaron Burr Sturgis.  Thursday evening Hoyt\r\ninsisted upon going out deer hunting upon the lake.  Burr took charge\r\nof him.  Hoyt had a shot, but missed the deer.  Friday evening the\r\neffort was renewed with the same result.  Burr insisted that the game\r\nwas in sight at a reasonable distance, and that Hoyt was a victim of\r\nthe disease known as _buck fever._  When Saturday evening came there\r\nwas a public sentiment in favor of changing the hunter as the party\r\nwere becoming weary of salt pork and trout.  Burr fixed upon me, and\r\nwarmly advocated my selection.  Hoyt was warm in advocacy of his own\r\nclaim.  Burr's partiality for me was due to the circumstance that at\r\nLake Pleasant I had sent a buck-shot fifteen rods straight to the mark.\r\nHoyt was finally driven from the field, his only consolation being my\r\npromise that I would fire but once, and whether successful or not, I\r\nwould return to the camp.\r\n\r\nThe hunter's boat was a narrow, long, flat-bottomed craft, capable of\r\ncarrying two persons if they were sober and careful.  I took my place\r\nin the bow of the boat, behind and rather under the jack.  I rested\r\nupon my knees, holding my gun in such a position that I could use it\r\nat short notice.  While we were crossing the lake to the feeding\r\nground, Burr gave me my instructions.  He said that when I saw the\r\ndeer in the light from the jack, he would look as though he were cut\r\nout of white paper.  Such proved to be the fact.  The light upon the\r\ndeer gave him the appearance of being white as the background was\r\nblack.  He appeared in profile only.  Next Burr said I must not fire\r\nuntil he gave me orders, as I could not judge of the distance.\r\n\r\nAfter a time the light fell upon a deer.  He raised his head and\r\ngazed upon the light.  Burr moved with the boat without making a\r\nripple and finally he held the boat with his oar and ordered me to\r\nfire.  This I did, and the deer ran for the shore, Burr pushed his\r\nboat to the quag, took the jack, and followed the track.  At the\r\ndistance of about fifteen rods he found the deer unable to move.  Burr\r\napplied his knife to the throat of the animal, and then dragged him to\r\nthe boat and we lifted him in.  As Burr turned the boat he said, \"Did\r\nyou her the deer whistle on the other side of the lake when you fired?\"\r\nI said no.  Burr said they whistled and he was going over to see if we\r\ncouldn't get a shot.  I referred to my promise to Hoyt, which Burr\r\nanswered with an oath of disapproval.  As I saw no reason for getting\r\nanother deer I was disgusted with the new movement, and neglected to\r\nre-load the empty barrel.  When we reached the other side, we could\r\nhear deer moving in the water among the tall grass, but we could not\r\nsee them.  After a time I became interested in the undertaking, and I\r\nraised myself upon my feet for the purpose of looking over the tall\r\ngrass.  At once I was seen by a deer, and he made for the shore without\r\ndelay.  In the excitement of the moment I discharged my remaining\r\nbarrel.  The deer stopped suddenly, raised his tail, and whistled.  I\r\nthought that I had shot him, and that he would soon fall into the\r\nwater.  I said to Burr, \"How am I to get that deer?\"  Burr said, \"I\r\ndon't know; you haven't hit him yet.\"  The deer stood for a minute\r\nwithin good range and fully exposed.  Luckily I had only an empty gun,\r\nor otherwise I might have killed a deer for which we had no use--for\r\nwhich there could have been no excuse.  The whistle of the animal was\r\na note of exultation and a notice that he was unharmed.  Had he been\r\nwounded he would have run without waiting to explain his condition.\r\nThis was the only success in deer hunting by any of the party.  Hoyt\r\nwent out several times, to return a disappointed man.\r\n\r\nI spent the larger part of a night upon Louis Lake with a Canadian\r\nFrenchman, of whom the rumor was, as I learned afterwards, that he was\r\na refugee charged with the murder of a woman.  While one might not\r\nchoose such a person for a guide upon a forest lake and in the night\r\ntime, yet criminals of that sort are very often safer companions than\r\nmany reckless persons not yet guilty of any great crime.  Murders\r\ncommitted under the influence of passion do not lead to other murders\r\nby the same parties.  On the Sunday following we arrived at a small\r\nlake where the camp was too limited for the accommodation of the\r\nentire party and those who had remained proceeded to join their\r\ncompanions.  The day was rainy and when we reached our destination, we\r\nfound that one end of the camp had been destroyed by fire and that the\r\npart standing furnished only inadequate room for the small party\r\nalready occupying it.  The building of a new and much larger camp was\r\nthe work of the entire party.  For a bed we cut great quantities of\r\nhemlock boughs and after shaking the water from them we laid them upon\r\nthe ground and in our blankets we lay down with our feet to a rousing\r\nfire which extended along the entire front of the camp not less than\r\ntwenty feet.  None of the party suffered from the experience.\r\n\r\nAt that time fishing for brook trout was not an art.  On one occasion\r\nI waded into the rapids of Racket River where the water was about two\r\nfeet deep, and as often as my hook struck the water, I would get a\r\nbite.  The fish were of uniform size and weighed about one pound each.\r\nWe had equally good fishing upon the streams which connect the\r\nEckford Lakes.  At Racket Lake a controversy arose about the route to\r\nbe taken.  Alvord and Hoyt had a plan which Bird did not approve.\r\nPierce and myself took no part in the debate; we had accepted Bird as\r\nleader and we chose to follow him.\r\n\r\nWe were quartered in a log house that had been built for the use of\r\nsome railway surveyors, but it was then occupied by a man who went by\r\nthe name of Wood.  It was rumored that he was a refugee from Lowell,\r\nMass.  He had lost both legs to the knees by freezing, and he walked\r\nupon the stumps with considerable speed.  He was able to walk to the\r\nsettlement at Lake Pleasant, a distance of thirty-eight miles.  He had\r\na wife and one daughter, who were as ignorant as barbarians.  After a\r\nwarm and almost bitter debate between Hoyt and Bird, a separation was\r\nresolved upon.  Hoyt and Alvord went northward and we resolved to\r\nreturn by the way of Indian and Louis Lakes to Lake Pleasant.  Bird\r\nhad incurred some expenses for our outfit, and Hoyt in his excitement\r\nresolved to pay his share at once.  He had no money nor was there any\r\nmoney of consequence in the party.  In this condition of affairs Hoyt\r\nexclaimed, \"Who will give me the money for a check on the Greenfield\r\nBank?\"\r\n\r\nBird, Pierce, and myself, with three guides, turned our faces toward\r\nthe Eckford Lakes and Mt. Emmons.  From Eckford we made our way to\r\nIndian Lake.  The day was warm and rainy in showers.  The guides were\r\nignorant of the route, having never passed over it, and the distance\r\nwas estimated at twenty miles.  We started in the morning in good\r\nspirits and confident of getting through to Forbes' Clearing on\r\nIndian Lake.  We followed a road made by the lumbermen and about noon\r\nwe crossed an upper branch of the Hudson and came upon a small dwelling\r\nwhere an Irishman and a boy were grinding an ax.\r\n\r\nThey were protected from flies and mosquitoes by a dull fire of chips\r\nand leaves called a smudge.  We asked for dinner and the way to Indian\r\nLake.  They could not give us a dinner nor say definitely how we were\r\nto get to Indian Lake.  The man said there was another house farther\r\nalong where we might get something to eat, and he would follow in a\r\nshort time and go with us to the lake.  We soon reached the second\r\ndwelling where we found a woman and children; the husband having gone\r\nto the settlement for supplies.  She gave us some ham and corn bread,\r\nto which we added tea from our own stock.  When we were approaching\r\nthe house, we saw a deer making for the thick forest.  This was the\r\nonly deer that I saw after my trip on the lake with Burr.  When our\r\nmeal was over, we followed the Irishman into the thick wood where\r\nthere was no path, and where our way was often blocked by fallen\r\ntrees.  Many times in the course of an hour we heard the noise caused\r\nby the fall of a tree, and once when winding our way by the steep side\r\nof a mountain, we saved ourselves by fleeing towards the lake.  The\r\ntree was a huge yellow birch and it was so much decayed that it was\r\nbroken into thousands of pieces, trunk as well as branches.\r\n\r\nWhen we began our trip, Pierce was unwell and the tramp of this day\r\nquite overcame him.  He often sat down upon fallen trees, and deplored\r\nhis folly in going into the woods.  He amused us by his bids, offering\r\nfirst five dollars and then from time to time advancing his offer to\r\nanyone who would set him down at old John C.'s.  When we came in sight\r\nof the lake we raised the sum of fifty cents for our guide and\r\ndismissed him.  We then proceeded up the lake, keeping ourselves within\r\nsight of it for the most part.  At about sunset we reached an opening\r\nwhere a small stream entered the lake.  Pierce sat down upon the ground\r\nand announced that he would not walk another step that night.  In that\r\ncondition of affairs we sent guides forward with such luggage as they\r\ncould take, and with directions to return with a boat as soon as they\r\nreached Forbes' Clearing.  During twilight we saw a boat coming down\r\nthe lake.  The boatman proved to be James Sturgis with a small boat\r\ndesigned to carry two persons.  We were four, and when we were seated\r\nthe water was within an inch of the top of the gunwale.  I told Sturgis\r\nto keep near the shore.  In doing so he ran upon the limb of a fallen\r\ntree.  The boat careened on one side and then the other, dipping water.\r\nAt last we got off and after an hour's rowing, we reached the clearing,\r\nwhere we got a supper and the privilege of sleeping on the floor of\r\nthe log house.\r\n\r\nThe next morning we obtained the use of a large flat-bottomed scow and\r\npaddled ourselves up the river which flows into the Indian Lake from\r\nLouis Lake.  The distance was about nine miles and through an intervale\r\nfrom half a mile to two miles in width.  This valley was studded with\r\nhuge trees at such a distance from each other that it might well be\r\ncalled a park, and when in a state of nature it must have been not only\r\nbeautiful, but magnificent.  The curse of civilization was upon it,\r\nhowever.  For lumbering purposes a dam had then been built across the\r\noutlet of Indian Lake, and the intervale had been overflowed until all\r\nthe trees were dead.  The grass was rich and we were told that it was\r\na favorite feeding ground of the deer.\r\n\r\nAt Louis Lake I made an excuse to visit Burr Sturgis' mother who lived\r\nwith her husband on the opposite side of the lake from our camp.  I\r\nasked Burr to take me across that I might get from his mother some\r\ncorn cakes.  We found Mrs. Sturgis to be a woman about forty-five years\r\nof age with some of the freshness of youth in her appearance, and in\r\nconversation quite above her surroundings.  She had had a large family\r\nof children all born in the woods.  The rumor among the guides was that\r\nshe was from Connecticut.  There were rumors about all the inhabitants\r\nof the woods, but of authentic history there was but little.  The\r\nimagination might sketch the history of Mrs. Sturgis.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--Burr Sturgis and James Sturgis were brothers.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\nORGANIZATION OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN MASSACHUSETTS IN 1855--AND THE\r\nEVENTS PRECEDING THE WAR\r\n\r\nIn the month of August 1855, the Republican Party of Massachusetts was\r\norganized, and under the head of those who signed the call, a\r\nconvention was held at Worcester, the eighteenth day of September, of\r\nthat year.  In Mr. Webster's time the Whig Party had been divided into\r\ntwo parts, known as Conscience Whigs and Cotton Whigs.  The Conscience\r\nWhigs had become Free-soilers, and the Cotton Whigs upheld the flag of\r\nthe party in the belief that trade would follow the flag.  The death of\r\nMr. Webster and the election of General Pierce ended the Whig Party in\r\nthe State.  In 1855 the Democratic Party was a nerveless organization,\r\nand without hope, except as the leaders looked to the supremacy of the\r\nparty in the country as a guaranty of office-holding to the few who\r\nwere in the ascendency in the commonwealth.  In one short year of power\r\nthe Know Nothing Party had destroyed its influence in the State.  Thus\r\nwas the way prepared for a new and formidable organization, destined\r\nto succeed under the declaration that slavery was not to be extended\r\nto the territories of the Union.\r\n\r\nThe first meeting of the men who led the organization of the Republican\r\nParty was held at the United States Hotel.  By adjournment the second\r\nmeeting was held at Chapman Hall.  At this meeting a committee of\r\ntwenty-seven persons was chosen, of which the Honorable Samuel Hoar was\r\nchairman.  He had been a Whig of the Federalist school, he was a\r\nlawyer of eminence, ranking all but the few greatest leaders of the\r\nbar, he had had a career of useful public service, and he enjoyed the\r\nrespect and the confidence of the commonwealth.  His associates were\r\nHomer Bartlett, Charles Francis Adams, George S. Boutwell, Stephen C.\r\nPhillips, George Bliss, H. L. Dawes, John Brooks, Charles Allen, Moses\r\nKimball, R. H. Dana, Jr., Marcus Morton, Jr., William H. Wood, W. S.\r\nBreckinridge, James H. Mitchell, George Grennell, D. W. Alvord,\r\nIncrease Sumner, William Clark, Charles W. Slack, Thomas D. Elliot,\r\nSamuel Bowles, William Brigham, Ivers Phillips, George Cogswell of\r\nBradford, John H. Shaw.  At this date, June 12, 1900, three of the\r\nsigners are living:  H. L. Dawes, George Cogswell, and the writer of\r\nthis volume.  A very exact account of the proceedings of the Chapman\r\nHall meeting may be found in the Boston _Journal_ under the dates of\r\nAugust 16, 17, 22, 23, and 30.\r\n\r\nMr. Franklin Dexter, a son of Samuel Dexter, was named upon the\r\ncommittee.  Mr. Dexter declined the appointment, and in a letter which\r\nis printed in the _Journal_ under one of the dates named, he gave his\r\nreasons.  The one controlling reason was the fear that the persons\r\nengaged in the movement would go too far and involve the country in\r\ntroubles and evils greater than those which the nation was then\r\nexperiencing.  To these considerations, Mr. Winthrop, in a private\r\ninterview, added objections of a personal nature.\r\n\r\nA supplementary call, signed by more than a hundred citizens, including\r\nSenator Wilson, was subjoined to the call of the committee.  The\r\nimpetus which the Know Nothing Party had received in the election of\r\n1854 was sufficient to secure the re-election of Governor Gardner over\r\nJulius Rockwell, the first candidate of the Republican Party in the\r\nState.  In 1856 Governor Gardner was elected as the candidate of the\r\nRepublican Party.  Since the year 1856 the Republican Party has given\r\ndirection to the policy of the State.\r\n\r\nIn 1858 my friends made an effort to secure my nomination for the\r\nUnited States House of Representatives.  I was indifferent to the\r\nmovement, although I did not decline to be considered for the\r\nnomination.  Some of my best friends urged me to remain where I was,\r\nand my opponents were certain that no one else could perform the\r\nduties in a manner so acceptable.  At the Convention I received sixty-\r\nthree votes, and my opponent, Charles R. Train, received sixty-six\r\nvotes.  Train was declared the nominee, and as such he was elected.\r\nAfter the Convention was over, some person of an inquiring turn of\r\nmind found that if every portion of the district had been represented\r\nthe total vote could not have exceeded one hundred and eighteen.  This\r\ndiscovery led to some crimination, each party charging the other with\r\nfraud.\r\n\r\nWhen in 1860 notices were posted in the town of Concord calling upon\r\nthe Republicans to meet in caucus, to choose delegates to the State\r\nConvention, Mr. Ralph Waldo Emerson called at the office of George M.\r\nBrooks, who was an active supporter of Mr. Train, and said:\r\n\r\n\"I see there is to be a caucus to choose delegates to the Convention,\r\nand I have called to make an inquiry about it, as Mr. Boutwell was\r\ncheated out of his nomination two years ago.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Brooks said in reply:\r\n\r\n\"This caucus is for delegates to the State Convention.  The District\r\nConvention has not been called.  But we thought the cheating was on\r\nthe other side.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Emerson.  \"I see that you are not for Mr. Boutwell.  Do\r\nyou know of anybody in the village who is for Mr. Boutwell?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Brooks did not give him the information, and he went away.  When\r\nthe evening came for the district caucus, the leading men who managed\r\nthe caucuses usually, went to the hall, and to their surprise they\r\nfound the transcendentalists in force, surrounded by a deep fringe of\r\nfarmers from all parts of the town.  The meeting was organized.  Four\r\ndelegates were to be chosen.  Upon the nomination of candidates the\r\nnames were placed upon a sheet of paper, and then the citizens passed\r\naround and each one marked against four names.  The friends of Train\r\nsecured the lead, in making nominations, and my friend followed with\r\nfour names.  When this ceremony was over, Mr. Emerson rose and said:\r\n\r\n\"The first four names on that paper are for Mr. Train.  The second four\r\nnames are for Mr. Boutwell.  We are for Mr. Boutwell, and our friends\r\nwill be careful not to vote for the first four names, but to vote for\r\nthe second four names.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Emerson's policy prevailed, and as far as I know, this was his\r\nonly appearance in Concord politics.  In that year I had a majority\r\nof the delegates to the convention, but I attended, withdrew my name,\r\nand nominated Mr. Train for election.  When I was elected in 1862, Mr.\r\nEmerson gave me his support and during my term I received many letters\r\nfrom him in approval of my course, which to many others seemed extreme\r\nand unwise.  My acquaintance with Mr. Emerson was never intimate, but\r\nit was always friendly and I rest in the belief that he so wished our\r\nrelations to continue.  It began in the Forties, when he honored me\r\nwith his presence at the Concord Lyceum, where, for a period, I had an\r\nopportunity to speak.  It was my better fortune to hear Mr. Emerson\r\nspeak on many occasions.  He was not an orator in a popular sense, but\r\nhe had the capacity to make his auditors anxious to hear what he would\r\nsay in his next sentence, which, not infrequently, was far removed from\r\nthe preceding sentence.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1859, I presided at a dinner in honor of Jefferson.  In the\r\nspeech that I then made, I predicted the Rebellion, although at that\r\ntime there were but few who expected an event more serious than a\r\npolitical struggle.  I then said:\r\n\r\n\"The great issue with slavery is upon us.  We cannot escape it.  The\r\npolicy of men may have precipitated the contest; but, from the first,\r\nit was inevitable.  The result is not doubtful.  The labor, the\r\nbusiness, the wealth, the learning, the civilization, of the whole\r\ncountry, South as well as North, will ultimately be found on the side\r\nof freedom.  The power of the North is not in injustice.  We are bound\r\nto be just; we can afford to be generous.  Concede to our brethren of\r\nthe South every constitutional right without murmuring and without\r\ncomplaint.  Under the Constitution and in the Union every difficulty\r\nwill disappear, every obstacle will be overcome.  But, rendering\r\njustice to others, let us secure justice for ourselves; and we of the\r\nNorth, not they of the South, shall be held responsible, if the slave-\r\ntrade upon the high seas is openly pursued or covertly permitted, if\r\nnew territory is consigned to slavery, or if the gigantic powers of\r\nthis government are longer perverted to the support of an institution\r\ndangerous to the welfare of the people and hostile to the perpetuity of\r\nthe Union.\"\r\n\r\nA letter from Abraham Lincoln was read at the Jefferson dinner.  As Mr.\r\nLincoln's letter has more value, manifestly, in the year 1901, than it\r\nappeared to have in the year 1859, I reprint the important parts of\r\nthat communication:\r\n\r\n\"Bearing in mind that about seventy years ago two great political\r\nparties were first formed in this country--that Jefferson was the head\r\nof one of them, and Boston the headquarters of the other, it is both\r\ncurious and interesting that those supposed to descend politically from\r\nthe party opposed to Jefferson should now be celebrating his birthday,\r\nin their own original seat of empire, while those claiming political\r\ndescent from him have nearly ceased to breathe his name everywhere.\r\nBut soberly, it is now no child's play to save the principles of\r\nJefferson from total overthrow in this nation.  One would state with\r\ngreat confidence that he could convince any sane child that the simpler\r\npropositions of Euclid are true; but nevertheless he would fail,\r\nutterly, with one who should deny the definitions and axioms.\r\n\r\n\"The principles of Jefferson are the definitions and axioms of free\r\nsociety.  And yet they are denied and evaded, with no small show of\r\nsuccess.  One dashingly calls them 'evident lies.'  And others\r\ninsidiously argue that they apply only to 'superior races.'\r\n\r\n\"These expressions, differing in form, are identical in object and\r\neffect--the supplanting the principles of free government, and\r\nrestoring those of classification, caste, and legitimacy.  They would\r\ndelight a convocation of crowned heads plotting against the people.\r\nThey are the vanguard--the sappers and miners of returning despotism.\r\nWe must repulse them, or they will subjugate us.  This is a world of\r\ncompensation; and he who would be no slave, must consent to have no\r\nslave.  Those who deny freedom to others, deserve it not for\r\nthemselves, and under a just God cannot long retain it.  All honor to\r\nJefferson--to the man who, in the concrete pressure of a struggle for\r\nnational independence by a single people, had the coolness, forecast\r\nand capacity to introduce into a merely revolutionary document an\r\nabstract truth, applicable to all men and all times, and so to embalm\r\nit there, that to-day and in all coming days, it shall be a rebuke and\r\na stumbling block to the very harbingers of reappearing tyranny and\r\noppression.\"\r\n\r\nIn the canvass of 1860 I made a speech at Cambridge in reply to a\r\nspeech made in Faneuil Hall by Mr. Yancey.  I again gave my opinion\r\nthat war was impending.  I then saw that the preliminary incidental\r\nconspiracy was in the Democratic Party, by which the party was to be\r\ndivided, and by which the Republican Party was assured of success.  Had\r\nthe government been continued in the hands of the Democrats there could\r\nhave been no pretext for rebellion.  The first necessary step in the\r\nmovement was the destruction of the Democratic Party.  That step was\r\ntaken, and thus the way was opened for the election of Mr. Lincoln.\r\nThe secession of the States, beginning with South Carolina, was a\r\nrecognition of the legitimacy of the Government, of which Mr. Lincoln\r\nbecame the head.  This recognition was consummated beyond question,\r\nwhen Vice-President Breckinridge announced the election of Mr. Lincoln,\r\nin February, 1861.\r\n\r\nThe interests of the seceding States would have been promoted as the\r\nmeasures of the incoming administration would have been retarded, if\r\nthe members from those States could have retained their seats in\r\nCongress.  It is probably that in the excitement of the time, the\r\nStates gave no thought to the question whether it would be wise to\r\nallow their members to remain in the old Congress, and there thwart the\r\nadministration in its efforts to raise men and money.  However that may\r\nhave been, when the Southern members left their seats they surrendered\r\nto the Republican Party that absolute power by which in the end the\r\nRebellion was suppressed.  Upon the theory of many Democrats and of\r\nsome Republicans, that the seceding States were never out of the Union,\r\nthey might have kept a representation in Congress while the States\r\nthemselves were carrying on a war for the destruction of the old\r\nGovernment.  Happily for the country the logic of events was mightier\r\nthan the logic of the schools.  The larger number of men who went out\r\nhaughtily in 1860 and 1861 never returned.\r\n\r\nIn 1861 I was invited to deliver an address at Charlestown, Mass., on\r\nthe anniversary of the Battle of New Orleans.  I said nothing of that\r\nbattle, for my thoughts were directed too exclusively to the prospect\r\nof war in the near future, to allow me to deal with the past except for\r\nthe purpose of warning or encouragement.  That address gave great\r\noffence to Democrats generally, and it led many Republicans to denounce\r\nme as unwise, and to declare that my counsels were dangerous.  Governor\r\nAndrew, who had just taken his seat as Governor, accepted the view that\r\nI expressed, as did his privy counsellor, Frank W. Bird, although they\r\nhad disagreed with me in the National Convention, of June, 1860.  They\r\nwere the earnest supporters of Mr. Seward, I was opposed to his\r\nnomination, and as I would not pledge myself to his support, I barely\r\nescaped defeat at the State Convention, which elected the delegates at\r\nlarge to the Chicago Convention.\r\n\r\nIn my address at Charlestown, I made these remarks, which gave no\r\ninconsiderable offence:\r\n\r\n\"In this juncture of affairs, we anxiously ask, what more remains to be\r\ndone?  I infer, from what I see and hear, that most of my countrymen\r\nbelieve that the election of Abraham Lincoln to the Presidency is to\r\nbe declared in the customary way, and that he is to be inaugurated at\r\nWashington on the 4th of March next.  The intentions of men are hidden\r\nfrom our view; but the necessities of the seceders we can appreciate,\r\nand the logic of events we can comprehend.  It is a necessity of the\r\nSouth to prevent the inauguration of Lincoln.  If he is inaugurated at\r\nWashington on the 4th of March, the cause of the secessionists is lost\r\nfor ever.  In all their proceedings, they have been wise and logical,\r\nthus far; and I assume that resistance to the inauguration of Lincoln\r\nis a part of their well-laid scheme.  No man can now tell whether this\r\nscheme will be abandoned, whether it will be tried and fail, or\r\nwhether it will be tried with success.  I believe it will be tried.\r\n\r\n\"True, the administration has put itself on the side of order; the city\r\nis alarmed for its existence, knowing full well that if it is given\r\nup to the military or the mob, and the representatives of eighteen free\r\nStates are, for a single hour only, fugitives from the capital of the\r\ncountry, its re-occupation will be upon terms less agreeable to the\r\ninhabitants of the District and the neighboring States.  The possession\r\nof Washington does, in a considerable degree, control the future of\r\nthis country.  Believing, as I do, in the stern purpose of these men;\r\nknowing, also, that Maryland and Virginia command on the instant the\r\npresence of large bodies of volunteers,--I deem it only an act of\r\ncommon prudence, for the free States, without menaces, without threats,\r\nwith solemn and official declarations even that no offensive movement\r\nwill be undertaken, to organize, and put upon a war footing, a force\r\nof one hundred thousand men, who may be moved at any moment when\r\ndesired by the authorities of the country.\r\n\r\n\"What, then, will be our position?  The way ought to be open for the\r\ninauguration of Mr. Lincoln; but there are those who demand a\r\ncompromise as a step necessary and preliminary to that event.  I do\r\nnot now speak of the demand made upon States, in their sovereign\r\ncapacity, to repeal certain laws, concerning personal liberty, alleged\r\nto be unconstitutional. . . .\r\n\r\n\"The compromises of which I speak are the various propositions, which\r\nproceed upon the idea that the election by the people of a President\r\nof the Republic, in constitutional ways and by constitutional means\r\nonly, shall not be consummated by his peaceful inauguration, unless the\r\ncharacter of the government is fundamentally changed previously, or\r\npledges given that such changes shall be permitted.  I see no great\r\nevidence that these demands are to be acceded to; but I see that the\r\ndemands themselves attack the fundamental principles of republican\r\nliberty.  If disappointed men, be they few or many, be they\r\nconspirators and traitors, or misguided zealots merely, can interpret\r\ntheir will, and arrest or divert or contravene the public judgment,\r\nconstitutionally expressed, then our government is no longer one of\r\nlaws, but a government of men.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\nAS SECRETARY OF THE MASSACHUSETTS BOARD OF EDUCATION\r\n\r\nIn the early autumn of 1855 the Board of Education elected me to the\r\noffice of secretary of the board.  The position was offered to Mr.\r\nGeorge B. Emerson, who declined to accept it for the reason that he\r\nwas unwilling to perform the necessary labor.  My predecessor was\r\nBarnas Sears, who resigned to accept the presidency of Brown\r\nUniversity.  I made no effort to secure the appointment; indeed, I was\r\ndoubtful as to the wisdom of accepting it.  I had been a member of the\r\nboard for several years, and I had had a limited acquaintance with Mr.\r\nMann during his term of office.  Mr. Mann had had a brilliant career.\r\nHe entered upon his duties at a time when the public schools of\r\nMassachusetts were in a low condition, and under his administration\r\nthere had been a revival of interest, whose force is felt, I imagine,\r\nto this day.  He attacked the customs and ridiculed the prejudices of\r\nthe people, made war upon the practice of corporal punishment, engaged\r\nin a controversy with the Boston schoolmasters, and in the end he\r\neither achieved a victory whenever a stand was made against him, or\r\nhe laid the foundation of ultimate success.\r\n\r\nDr. Sears was a man of peace.  He was a carefully educated scholar and\r\nprogressive in his ideas, but he relied upon quiet labor and carefully\r\nprepared arguments.  He was at the head of the school system for the\r\nlong period of thirteen years, and in that time great progress was\r\nmade.  He supplemented Mr. Mann by a steady and sturdy effort to\r\nestablish permanently the reforms which Mr. Mann had inaugurated.  One\r\nobnoxious relic of the ancient ways remained--the district system.  In\r\n1840 Governor Morton had called the school districts of the State,\r\n\"Little Democracies.\"  They were in fact little nurseries of\r\nselfishness and intrigue.  In the selection of teachers, in the\r\nerection and repairs of school houses, and even in the business of\r\nfurnishing the firewood, there were little intrigues and arrangements\r\nby which interested parties secured the appointment of a son or\r\ndaughter to the place of teacher, or a contract for wood or work.  The\r\nelection of the committee not infrequently turned upon the interest\r\nof some influential citizens.\r\n\r\nThe great evil was the inefficiency of the teachers.  Even in cases\r\nwhere the committeeman was left free to act, he was usually incapable\r\nof forming a safe opinion as to the quality of teachers.  To be sure\r\nthe examination and approval of candidates were left to the\r\nsuperintending committee, but most frequently the examination was\r\ndeferred to a time only one or two days prior to the day when the\r\nschool was to be commenced and the committee would too often yield to\r\nthe temptation to keep the candidate even though the qualifications\r\nwere unsatisfactory.  The contest with the district system fell upon\r\nme, and during my administration the system was abolished.  The end\r\nwas not accomplished without vigorous opposition.\r\n\r\nThe citizens of the town of Mansfield took the field and under a\r\nmemorial to the Legislature they appeared before the Committee on\r\nEducation.  The hearings were public in the hall of the House of\r\nRepresentatives.  They made personal attacks upon me--among other\r\nthings alleging that my traveling expenses were greater than the law\r\nallowed.  This charge was met successfully by an opinion that had\r\nbeen given by Attorney-General Clifford.  I changed the defence to an\r\nattack upon the promoters of the movement, and they retreated after a\r\ncontest of several days; one of the party admitting that they were\r\nwrong in their views and wrong in their actions.  For the most part,\r\nthey were well intentioned persons, but not informed, or rather they\r\nwere misinformed upon the subject of education.  They were unimportant\r\nin numbers, but for a time they strewed the State with handbills,\r\nplacards and newspaper articles.  They illustrated one half of the\r\nfable of the frog and the ox.\r\n\r\nIn my five years of service I made more than three hundred addresses\r\nupon educational topics.  In that service I visited most of the cities\r\nand towns, met the citizens individually and in masses, visited the\r\nfactories and shops, and thus I became well acquainted with the habits\r\nof the people, their industries and modes of life.  In each year I\r\nheld twelve teachers' institutes and each institute continued five days\r\nin session.  A portion of each day was given to criticisms, during\r\nwhich time the teachers of the institute and the lecturers were freely\r\ncriticised by cards sent to the chair without the names of the critics.\r\nHence there was the greatest freedom, and no one on the platform was\r\nallowed to escape.  It is an unusual thing to find a speaker, even of\r\nthe highest culture, who can speak an hour without violating the rules\r\nof pronunciation, or showing himself negligent in some important\r\nparticular.  The teachers of the teachers gained daily by these\r\ncritical exercises.\r\n\r\nAmong the lecturers and teachers were some men of admitted eminence.\r\nAgassiz was with me about two years as lecturer in Natural History.\r\nHis skill in drawing upon the blackboard while he went on with his oral\r\nexplanation was a constant marvel.  He was not a miser in matter of\r\nknowledge more than in money.  Of his vast stores of knowledge he gave\r\nfreely to all.  Any member of a class could get from him all that he\r\nknew upon any topic in his department.  When he was ignorant he never\r\nhesitated to say:  \"I don't know.\"  He was very chary of conjectures in\r\nscience.  Indeed, I cannot recall an instance of that sort.  He chose\r\nto investigate and to wait.  In all his ways he was artless.  He was a\r\nwell built man with a massive head and an intelligent face.  His\r\npresence inspired confidence.\r\n\r\nAssociated with him by nativity and ties of friendship, was Professor\r\nGuyot.  Professor Guyot taught physical geography, and previous to 1855\r\nhe had wrought a change in public opinion in regard to the method of\r\nintroducing the science to children.  All the then recent text-books\r\nomitted physical geography, or reserved it for a brief chapter at the\r\nclose of the work.  Guyot changed the course of study.  His motto was\r\nthis:  \"We must first consider this earth as one grand individual.\"\r\nOn this foundation he built his system.  Morse, the father of the\r\ninventor of the system of telegraphic communication, was the author of\r\na geography published in the eighteenth century, and he commenced with\r\nphysical geography.  His successors, Cummings, Worcester, and others\r\nabandoned that scientific arrangement and introduced the learners to\r\npolitical and descriptive geography.  Moreover, their teaching of\r\nphysical geography was devoted to definitions to be learned by rote.\r\nMany of the text-books in use in the schools were framed upon similar\r\nerroneous ideas.  The first sentence in Murray's Grammar was a\r\ndefinition of the science, and was in fact, the conclusion deduced\r\nfrom a full knowledge of the subject.\r\n\r\nGeorge B. Emerson, who was one of our teachers, gave a great impetus to\r\nthe art of teaching grammar.  He discarded books, and beginning with an\r\nobject, as a bell or an orange, he would give a child at the age of\r\ntwelve years a very good knowledge of the science in six lessons of an\r\nhour each.  Dr. Lowell Mason was a teacher in the institutes during my\r\nentire period of service, although he offered to retire on account of\r\nage.  He was an excellent teacher, and in the art practically, perhaps,\r\nthe best of all.  Professor William Russell was the teacher of\r\nelocution.  His recitations were good, as were his criticisms on\r\nlanguage, but as a teacher, he had not a high rank.  After the\r\nretirement of Professor Agassiz, I employed Sanborn Tenney, a young man\r\nof great industry and enthusiasm.  He had in him the promise of a\r\ngreat career in natural science, but he died prematurely in the State\r\nof Michigan while upon a lecturing tour.  From first to last I had\r\nthe benefit of a good corps of teachers with a single exception.  In\r\ndrawing I inherited from Dr. Sears a young man of English parentage.\r\nHis statements were so extraordinary often, that I lost confidence in\r\nhim.  One day he wandered from his subject and indulged himself in\r\ndenunciations of the English aristocracy.  He closed with this remark:\r\n\"Although I belong to the haristocracy, I 'ate 'em!\"  At the end of\r\nthe autumn term, I dismissed him.\r\n\r\nDuring my service as Secretary, I made the acquaintance of several\r\npersons whom I should not otherwise have known.  Among them were\r\nPresident Hopkins of Williams College, President Hitchcock of Amherst\r\nCollege, and President Felton of Harvard College.  Hopkins might\r\nproperly be termed a wise man.  He resembled President Walker who for\r\nseveral years presided over Harvard.  Felton was a genial man, of\r\nsufficient learning for his office, and exceedingly popular with the\r\nstudents and with the public.  It was during his administration that\r\nI was elected to membership in the American Academy of Arts and\r\nSciences, through his influence, and the influence of the professors\r\nat the College.\r\n\r\nI resigned the office of Secretary, January 1, 1861, with the purpose\r\nof resuming the practice of law.  During my term of office, I prepared\r\nfive annual reports, the last of which, the twenty-fourth in the\r\nSeries, was devoted to an analysis of the school laws with a history of\r\nthe educational and reformatory institutions of the State.  I also\r\npublished a volume of educational papers, which had a considerable\r\nsale, especially in the State of Ohio, where a copy was ordered for\r\neach school library.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\nPHI BETA KAPPA ADDRESS AT CAMBRIDGE\r\n\r\nAbout ten days before the 18th of June, 1861, Judge Hoar called at my\r\noffice and invited me to deliver the Phi Beta Kappa oration at\r\nCambridge on the 18th of the month.  Although I had but little time for\r\npreparation, I accepted the invitation upon the understanding, or\r\nrather upon his request, that I was to deal with the questions then\r\nagitating the country.  Among my hearers was the venerable Josiah\r\nQuincy, formerly President of the College.  My address was so radical\r\nthat the timid condemned it, and even Republican papers deprecated the\r\nviolence of my language--they then living in the delusion that\r\nconcessions, mild words and attitudes of humility could save the Union.\r\nMr. Quincy was not of those.  He gave to my address unqualified\r\nsupport, and I had no doubt that the majority of my audience\r\nsympathized with my views.  There were, however, copperheads, and\r\npeace-men at any price, and gradually there appeared a more troublesome\r\nclass of men who professed to be for the prosecution of the war, but\r\ncriticized and condemned all the means employed.  They were the\r\nhypocrites in politics--a class of men who affect virtue, and who\r\ntolerate and protect vice in government.\r\n\r\nMy address was called \"The Conspiracy--Its Purpose and Power,\" and as\r\nfar as I know, it was the first time that emancipation was demanded\r\npublicly, as a means of ending the war and saving the nation.  The\r\ndemand was made in a qualified form, but I renewed it in the December\r\nfollowing in an address that I delivered before the Emancipation\r\nLeague.  This address gave rise to similar or even to severer\r\ncriticisms from the same classes.  They were never a majority in\r\nMassachusetts, but they had sufficient power to impair the strength of\r\nthe state, and in 1862 under the style of the People's Party, they\r\nendangered the election of Governor Andrew.\r\n\r\nThese criticisms made no impression upon me, for my confidence was\r\nunbounded that emancipation was inevitable and I was willing to wait\r\nfor an improved public opinion.\r\n\r\nI quote a portion of my remarks at Cambridge, which gave rise to\r\ncriticism in some quarters, and provoked hostility among those whose\r\nsympathies were with the South:\r\n\r\n\"The settlers at Jamestown and Plymouth did not merely found towns or\r\ncounties or colonies, or States even; they also founded a great nation,\r\nand upon the idea of its unity.\r\n\r\n\"Their colonial charters extended from sea to sea.  Their origin, their\r\nlanguage, their laws, their civilization, their ideas, and now their\r\nhistory, constitute us one nation.  In the geological structure of this\r\ncontinent, Nature seems to have prepared it for the occupation of a\r\nsingle people.  I cannot doubt, then, that continental unity is the\r\ngreat, the supreme law of our public life.\r\n\r\n\"A division such as is sought and demanded by those who carry on this\r\nwar would do violence to our traditions, to our history, to those ideas\r\nthat our people South and North have entertained for more than two\r\ncenturies, and to the laws of Nature herself.  An agreement such as is\r\ndesired by the discontented would only intensify our alienations,\r\nembitter the strife, and protract the war upon subordinate and\r\ninsignificant issues.  Separation does not settle one difficulty at\r\npresent existing in the country; while it furnishes occasion, and\r\nnecessity even, for other controversies and wars, as long as the line\r\nof division remains.\r\n\r\n\"Nor can we doubt, that when, by division, you abandon the Union,\r\nacknowledge the Constitution to be a failure, the contest would be\r\ncarried on regardless of State sovereignty, and finally end in the\r\nsubjugation of all to one idea, and one system in government.  Whatever\r\nmay stand or fall, whatever may survive or perish, the region between\r\nthe Atlantic and the Rocky Mountains, between the great lakes and the\r\nGulf of Mexico, is destined to be and to continue under one form of\r\ngovernment. . . .\"\r\n\r\nI advanced a step further in December, as will be seen from the\r\nextracts from my speech on Emancipation:\r\n\r\n\"I say, then, it is a necessity that this war be closed speedily.  By\r\nblockade it cannot be; by battle it may be; but we risk the result upon\r\nthe uncertainty whether the great general of this continent is with\r\nthem or with us.  I come, then, to emancipation.  Not first,--although\r\nI shall not hesitate to say, before I close, that as a matter of\r\njustice to the slave, there should be emancipation,--but not first do I\r\nask my countrymen to proclaim emancipation to the slaves in justice to\r\nthem, but as a matter of necessity to ourselves; for, unless it be by\r\naccident, we are not to come out of this contest as one nation, except\r\nby emancipation.  And first, emancipation in South Carolina.  Not\r\nconfiscation of the property of rebels; that is inadequate longer to\r\nmeet the emergency.  It might have done in March or April or May, or\r\npossibly in July; but, in December, or January of the coming year,\r\nconfiscation of the property of the rebels is inadequate to meet the\r\nexigency in which the country is placed.  You must, if you do anything,\r\nproclaim at the head of the armies of the republic, on the soil of\r\nSouth Carolina, FREEDOM,--and then enforce the proclamation as far and\r\nfast as you have an opportunity; and you will have opportunity more\r\nspeedily then than you will if you attempt to invade South Carolina\r\nwithout emancipating her slaves.  Unsettle the foundations of society\r\nin South Carolina; do you hear the rumbling?  Not we, not we, are\r\nresponsible for what happens in South Carolina between the slaves and\r\ntheir masters.  Our business is to save the Union; to re-establish the\r\nauthority of the Union over the rebels in South Carolina; and, if\r\nbetween the masters and their slaves collisions arise, the\r\nresponsibility is upon those masters who, forgetting their allegiance\r\nto the Government, lent themselves to this foul conspiracy, and thus\r\nhave been involved in ruin.  As a warning, let South Carolina be the\r\nfirst of the States of the Republic in which emancipation to the\r\nenslaved is proclaimed.\"\r\n\r\nI left home for Washington on the Monday following the Sunday when the\r\nfirst battle of Bull Run was fought.  When near New Haven, the\r\nconductor brought me a copy of a press despatch which gave an account\r\nof the engagement and indicated or stated that the rebels had been\r\nsuccessful.  On the seat behind me were two men who expressed their\r\ngratification to each other, when they read the despatch over my\r\nshoulder.  When I had a fair view of them, I formed the opinion that\r\nthey were Southern men returning South to take part in the conflict.\r\nIt is difficult to comprehend the control which the States' Rights\r\ndoctrine had over the Southern mind.  In my conversations with General\r\nScott the influence which the course pursued by Virginia exercised\r\nover him was apparent.  Those conversations left upon me the impression\r\nthat he had debated with himself as to the course he ought to pursue.\r\nAttachment to Virginia was the sole excuse which Lee offered in his\r\nletter to his sister which contained a declaration that there was no\r\njust cause for secession.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1861, Washington was comparatively defenceless.  Mr. Lincoln\r\nwas calm, but I met others who were quite hopeless of the result.\r\n\r\nMy speech upon Emancipation in December, 1861, led to a request from\r\nthe publishers of the _Continental Magazine_ for an article upon the\r\nsubject.  It appeared in February, 1862, and in that article I set\r\nforth the necessity of immediate emancipation as a war measure, and\r\nby virtue of the war power, under the title, \"Our Danger, and Its\r\nCause.\"  Rapid changes were then taking place in public opinion, and\r\nin Massachusetts the tide was strong in favor of vigorous action.  It\r\nwas arrested temporarily in the summer of 1862, by the untoward events\r\nof the war, and the \"People's Party\" became formidable for a brief\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nOne of the peculiar circumstance of the contest was the acceptance by\r\nGeneral Devens of the post of candidate for Governor by the People's\r\nParty.  General Devens was then in the army, and with considerable\r\nexperience he had shown the qualities of a good soldier.  But he was\r\nnot a Republican.  In other days he had been a Webster Whig, and as\r\nmarshal of the district of Massachusetts he had charge officially of\r\nthe return of the negro Sims to slavery.\r\n\r\nThis act had brought down upon him criticisms, quite like maledictions,\r\nfrom the Anti-Slavery Party.  By these criticisms he had been\r\nembittered, and although he was hearty in support of the war, he had\r\nnot then reached a point in his experience when he could realize that\r\nthe only efficient way of supporting the war was to support the\r\nRepublican Party.\r\n\r\nAt a later period he identified himself with the Republican Party, and\r\nas a Republican he filled with honor a place upon the bench of the\r\nSupreme Court of Massachusetts, and upon the election of President\r\nHayes, he was made Attorney-General of the United States.  That office\r\nhe filled with tact, urbanity, and reasonable ability.  He belonged to\r\na class of orators of which Massachusetts has furnished a considerable\r\nnumber--Mr. Everett was the chief.  His disciples or followers\r\nincluded Hillard, Burlingame, Bullock, Devens, Long, and some others\r\nof lesser note.  The style of these men was attractive, sometimes\r\nornate, but lacking in the force which leaves an indelible impression\r\nupon the hearer.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV\r\nTHE PEACE CONVENTION OF 1861\r\n\r\nIn the month of January, 1861, the State of Virginia invited the States\r\nto send delegates to a congress or convention to be held in the city of\r\nWashington.  The call implied that the Union was a confederation of\r\nStates as distinguished from an independent and supreme and sovereign\r\ngovernment, set up and maintained by the people of the whole country,\r\nexcept as the States were made the servants of the nation for certain\r\nspecified purposes.  There was hesitation on the part of Massachusetts,\r\nand some of the States of the North declined to respond to the call.\r\nAfter delay, Governor Andrew appointed John Z. Goodrich, Charles Allen,\r\nGeorge S. Boutwell, T. P. Chandler, F. B. Crowninshield, J. M. Forbes,\r\nand Richard P. Waters as commissioners to the convention.\r\n\r\nThe meeting was held on the 6th of February in Willard's Hall, in the\r\ncity of Washington.  The door upon the street was closed, and the\r\ndelegates were admitted from Willard's Hotel through a side door, cut\r\nfor the purpose.  The entrance was guarded by a messenger, and only\r\nmembers were admitted.  There were no reporters, but Mr. Chittenden, of\r\nVermont, made notes from which he prepared a volume that was published,\r\nbut not until several years after the congress had ceased to exist.  A\r\nfew of the members furnished him with reports of their speeches, but\r\nnot always in the language used at the time of delivery.  My memory of\r\nwhat was said by Mr. Chase and Mr. Frelinghuysen did not correspond\r\nwith the Chittenden Report.  As the Convention had been in session\r\nseveral days when the Massachusetts delegation appeared, we were\r\nassigned to seats that were remote from the chair.\r\n\r\nThe convention was composed of three classes of men.  Secessionists,\r\nled by John Tyler, the president of the convention, Seddon of Virginia,\r\nand Davis and Ruffin of North Carolina; border State men from Virginia,\r\nMaryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Kentucky, who had faith in\r\ndiffering degrees that the Union might be saved, and war averted; and\r\nradical men who had no faith that anything could be done by which the\r\nUnion could be saved, except through war.  Soon after my arrival in\r\nWashington, I called on a Sunday upon Mr. Seddon.  We had a free\r\nconversation.  He said:\r\n\r\n\"It is of no use for us to attempt to deceive each other.  You have one\r\nform of civilization, and we have another.  You think yours is the best\r\nfor you, and we think that ours is the best for us.  But our culture is\r\nexhausting, and we must have new lands.  One part of your people say\r\nthat Congress shall exclude slavery from the territories, and another\r\nset of men say that it will be excluded by natural laws.  Under either\r\ntheory, somebody must go, and if we can't go with our slaves, we must\r\ngo without them and our country will be given up to the negroes.\"\r\n\r\nWith the system of slavery, and in the absence of knowledge of the\r\nvalue of manufactured fertilizers, this was not an unreasonable view.\r\nLooking forward a hundred years and assuming the continued existence\r\nof slavery, there was no conclusive solution of the problem presented\r\nby Mr. Seddon.  But he did not seem to consider that he was warring\r\nagainst nature as well as against the Union in his attempt to extend\r\nthe area of slavery.  His efforts, had they been successful, could\r\nonly have postponed the crisis for a period not definite, but surely\r\nnot of long duration.  When the Confederacy was formed, Mr. Seddon\r\nbecame Secretary of War, and when the war was over, I recognized his\r\nfriendship by securing the removal of his disabilities under the\r\nFourteenth Amendment.  Of the Secessionists, Mr. Seddon was the\r\nleading man upon the floor of the convention.  It was manifest that he\r\ndid not wish to secure the return of the seceded States.  On one\r\npoint he was anxious, and he did not attempt to disguise his purpose.\r\nHe sought to secure from the convention, or if not from the convention,\r\nfrom the delegates from the Republican States, an assurance that in no\r\nevent should there be war.  One of the errors, indeed, the greatest\r\nerror, was the failure of the Northern delegates to assert that in no\r\nevent should the Union be dissolved except through the success of the\r\nSouth in arms.  As far as I remember, this was not asserted by any one\r\nexcept myself.\r\n\r\nMany expressed their fear of war and urged the convention to agree to\r\nsome plan of settlement as the only means of averting war.  Mr.\r\nStockton, of New Jersey, went so far as to assert that in case of war\r\nthe North would raise a regiment to aid the South as often as one was\r\nraised to assail it.  Mr. Chase's remarks on the floor of the\r\nconvention indicated a disposition to allow the South to go without\r\nresistance on our part, and in a conversation that I had with him as\r\nwe walked one evening on Pennsylvania Avenue, toward Georgetown, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"The thing to be done is to let the South go.\"\r\n\r\nThe interest of the convention centred upon the Committee of Thirteen,\r\nof which Mr. Guthrie was chairman.  While the Committee of Thirteen was\r\nconsidering what should be done, Mr. John Z. Goodrich said that he had\r\ncalled upon Mr. Seward, and that Mr. Seward expressed a wish to see me.\r\nI had not the personal acquaintance of Mr. Seward, and Mr. Goodrich\r\noffered to take me to Mr. Seward's house.  We called in the evening.\r\nHis conversation and bearing were different from the conversation and\r\nbearing of most of the public men of the time.  He spoke as though the\r\nsubject of conversation was the chance of a client and the means of\r\nbringing him safely out of his perils.  He spoke of the speech he had\r\nmade in the Senate and said:\r\n\r\n\"My speech occupies the mind of the South for the present:  then the\r\nproceedings of the Peace Congress will attract attention, and by and\r\nby we shall have the President's inaugural which will probably have\r\na good influence.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not assume the probability of war.  Before we left he asked me\r\nwhether I had seen a certain number of the _Richmond Enquirer._  I said\r\nthat I had not.  He sent for it, and gave it to me with the request\r\nthat I should return it after reading the leading editorial.  The\r\neditorial was upon Mr. Seward, and it was written upon the theory that\r\nhe was engaged in a scheme for delaying definite action in Virginia\r\nand the other States of the South, until the inauguration of Mr.\r\nLincoln, when he would use both whip and spur.  From the conversation\r\nand the editorial I inferred that he intended to have me understand\r\nthat such was his purpose.  It is possible he may have thought that war\r\ncould be averted by dilatory proceedings.\r\n\r\nWhen the report of the Committee of Thirteen was made, the border State\r\nmen had high hopes that the country, both North and South, would accept\r\nits recommendations.  In truth, there was no ground for believing that\r\nthe Secessionists or the anti-slavery Republicans, would accept the\r\npropositions.  The recommendations were more offensive to the North\r\nthan the original constitution, with all the compromise legislation,\r\nconsidered together.\r\n\r\nI think that there were five speeches made in support of the\r\nresolutions before a speech was made in opposition, and it fell to me\r\nto make that speech.  One morning there was a conference between the\r\nMassachusetts delegation, which was composed of radical men only, and\r\nthe radical members of the New York delegation, at which it was\r\nagreed that a speech should be made in opposition, and that\r\nMassachusetts should lead.  The duty was put upon me, accompanied with\r\nthe suggestion that I should speak that day.  I had not made any\r\npreparation, but during the time that I had occupied a seat in the\r\nconvention, my conviction had been strengthened that it was impossible\r\nto adopt a plan that would be acceptable to the contending parties,\r\nand consequently that any scheme of compromise that could be framed\r\nwould result in a renewal of the controversy, under circumstances less\r\nfavorable to the North.  At that moment the government was in the\r\nhands of men who were incapable of decisive action.  While we could not\r\ncount upon active measures against secession on the part of Mr.\r\nBuchanan, on the other hand, the country had ample assurance that he\r\nwould do nothing in aid of the unlawful proceeding.  That he had\r\ndeclared in his message of December, 1860.  Beyond that, we had a right\r\nto assume that Mr. Lincoln would maintain the Union by force.  Hence, I\r\nresolved to say that no scheme would be accepted by us which did not\r\ncontain an abandonment of the doctrine of secession, an acknowledgment\r\nof the legality of Mr. Lincoln's election, and a declaration that it\r\nwas the duty of the whole body of citizens to render obedience to the\r\nGovernment.  I very well knew that these terms would be rejected with\r\nscorn, as I well knew that any other terms would be rejected.\r\nConspirators are never disposed to make terms with the party or person\r\nagainst whom their conspiracy is aimed, until the conspiracy has\r\nfailed.  Hence it was that those who humbled themselves in the dust\r\nwere treated with contumely, even more offensive than the invectives\r\nwhich the conspirators showered upon the heads of those who neither\r\nproffered nor accepted terms of compromise.\r\n\r\nMr. Chittenden's report is accurate in respect to the views that I\r\npresented, but it is incomplete, as I spoke about an hour.  When I\r\nbegan to speak, I advanced slowly up the aisle until I could look into\r\nthe faces of the Virginia delegation, who occupied the settee next to\r\nthe president's desk.  Mr. William C. Rives was one of the Virginia\r\ndelegation, a Union man, who sympathized with the border State men, and\r\nhoped by some concession to avert war.  When I said that if the South\r\npersisted in secession, \"the South would march its armies to the Great\r\nLakes, or we should march ours to the Gulf of Mexico,\" the tears came\r\ninto his eyes.  My remark that the North abhorred the institution of\r\nslavery, wounded the Southern men sorely.  They were not indignant, but\r\ngrieved rather.  At any rate, such was their aspect, and for many days\r\nthe remark was repeated or referred to with the hope, apparently, of\r\ninducing me to retract or qualify it.  I allowed it to stand as a\r\ntruth which they might well accept.\r\n\r\nWhen the day came for the final vote upon the first resolution relating\r\nto slavery as reported by the Committee of Thirteen, a meeting of the\r\nNew York delegation was called in consequence of the engagement of\r\nDavid Dudley Field to argue a case in the Supreme Court.  Mr. Field was\r\none of the six Republican members, and associated with them were five\r\nDemocrats and Conservatives.\r\n\r\nAs each State had one vote, his absence would set New York out of the\r\ncontest unless the Democrats would agree that Mr. Field's vote should\r\nbe counted in his absence.  This proposition the Democrats refused to\r\naccept, and they gave notice that the vote of New York would be lost\r\nunless Mr. Field remained and voted.  Mr. Field left, and the vote of\r\nthe State was lost.  There were twenty-one States represented,\r\nincluding Kansas, which was in a territorial condition when the\r\nconvention assembled, and the Territorial Governor had sent a\r\nConservative, Mr. Thomas Ewing, Jr.  His father was a member from Ohio.\r\nWhen the State government of Kansas was organized, the Governor\r\ndelegated a Republican.  Both were allowed seats, although manifestly,\r\nMr. Ewing should have retired.\r\n\r\nWhen the vote was declared, it appeared that eight States had voted in\r\nthe affirmative, and eleven States in the negative.  The border State\r\nmen were sorely disappointed, and some of them wept like children.  The\r\nresult they must have anticipated, but they had been wrought to a high\r\ncondition of nervous excitement, due in part to the circumstance that\r\nthey were unable to discuss the business of the convention in public.\r\nThe disagreeable silence which followed the announcement of the vote,\r\nwas broken by Mr. Francis Granger, who counseled calmness and\r\ndeliberation, and finally, he appealed to the States of the majority\r\nto move a reconsideration.  This was done by the State of Illinois,\r\nthrough Mr. Turner, who made the motion.  The next day the resolution\r\nwas adopted by a vote of nine to eight.  Upon this question the\r\nMissouri delegation refused to vote, under the lead, it was said, of\r\nGeneral Doniphan, who denounced the resolutions as not satisfactory to\r\neither side.  Doniphan was a large, muscular man, who acquired some\r\nfame in the Mexican war as the leader of a cavalry expedition to\r\nCalifornia, of which nothing was heard for about six months.\r\n\r\nThe reconsideration was attributed to the interference of Mr. Lincoln\r\nor of his recognized friends.\r\n\r\nWhen the convention was about to adjourn, President Tyler made a speech\r\nin which he thrice invoked the blessing of Heaven upon the doings of\r\nthe convention, and from that act he went to Richmond, and in less than\r\nthree days he was an avowed and recognized leader in secession.\r\nIndeed, it was understood in the convention that Mr. Seddon was his\r\nrepresentative on the floor.  The doings of the Congress were endorsed\r\nby Maryland, but in the National Congress, and in the States North and\r\nSouth they were neglected utterly.  The result which Mr. Seward\r\nanticipated was not realized by the country.\r\n\r\nAfter the arrival of Mr. Lincoln the Massachusetts delegation called\r\nupon him to recommend the selection of Mr. Chase for the Treasury\r\nDepartment in preference to General Cameron, and to say that the\r\ncapitalists of the East would have more confidence in the former than\r\nin the latter.  Mr. Lincoln did not say what his purposes were, but\r\nhe made this remark:\r\n\r\n\"From what I hear, I think Mr. Chase is about one hundred and fifty to\r\nany other man's hundred.\"\r\n\r\nOn the Saturday next but one, preceding the 4th of March, we called\r\nupon Mr. Buchanan at about eleven o'clock in the morning.  He said that\r\nhe should prefer to see us in the evening.  In the evening we found him\r\nalone.  He at once commenced conversation, which he continued with but\r\nslight interruptions on our part.  His chief thought seemed to be to\r\navert bloodshed during his administration.  Next, he thought he had\r\nbeen wronged by both sections.  Said he:\r\n\r\n\"When I rebuked the North for their personal-liberty bills, the South\r\napplauded; but when I condemned the secession movement, then they\r\nturned against me.\"\r\n\r\nHe referred to the _Charleston Mercury_ as having been very unjust, and\r\nthen putting his feet together, and with his head on one shoulder, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"I am like a man on a narrow isthmus, without a friend on either side.\"\r\n\r\nWithin a few days of this interview, we called upon General Cass, who\r\nwas then living in a house that is now annexed to the Arlington Hotel.\r\nHe had retired from the Cabinet of Mr. Buchanan, and he had regained\r\nsomething of his standing in the North, but he had been so long the\r\nadvocate of compromises and the servant of the slave power, that he was\r\nunable to place himself in line with the movement that was destined to\r\ndestroy slavery.  The slave power had more vitality than slavery\r\nitself; and after a third of a century its poison still disturbs the\r\npolitics of the country.  The call was made in the forenoon.  General\r\nCass sat at a small, plain table, engaged in writing.  He was in a\r\nlarge room, from which the furniture, including the carpets, had been\r\nremoved.  He said that he had been kept in Washington by the illness of\r\nhis daughter, and that upon her improvement he should leave for\r\nMichigan.  He was dressed in a much worn suit of black--his shirt had\r\nseen more than one day's service--he had not been shaved recently, and\r\nhis russet-colored wig was on awry.  The room had an aspect of\r\ndesolation, and General Cass appeared like a man to whom life had\r\nnothing of interest.  As soon as the ceremony of introduction was over,\r\nhe commenced walking and talking, while the tears ran down his wan and\r\nworn cheeks.  He gave us an account of his early life, of his residence\r\nin Virginia, and then he said:\r\n\r\n\"I crossed the Ohio with only a dollar in my pocket.  I went to\r\nMichigan.  I was four times Governor of the Territory, and on more than\r\none occasion I was confirmed by the Senate without a single dissenting\r\nvote.  I have been a Senator, and Minister to France; and I am going\r\nhome to Michigan to die.  If I wanted the office of constable, there\r\nisn't a town in the State that would elect me.\"\r\n\r\nHe reminded me of Cardinal Wolsey, rather than of the Senator, Minister\r\nto France, and Secretary of the Department of State that he had been.\r\nHe spoke of his course in politics, the substance of which was that he\r\nhad always opposed secession and nullification, although he had\r\nmaintained the right of the States to hold slaves if they chose to\r\ntolerate the institution.\r\n\r\nGeneral Cass was the last of the statesmen of the middle period of our\r\nhistory whom it was my fortune to meet.  As a whole, and as individuals\r\ntheir fortunes were unenviable.  They struggled against the order of\r\nthings.  They accomplished nothing, unless it may be said of them, that\r\nthey kept the ship afloat.  Their memories deserve commiseration,\r\npossibly gratitude.  No effort of theirs could have secured the\r\nabolition of slavery.  Any vigorous movement in that direction would\r\nhave ended in the destruction of the government.  From John Adams to\r\nLincoln, only three important measures remain:  The acquisition of\r\nLouisiana, the acquisition of California, and the Independent Treasury\r\nBill.  The war of 1812 was unwise, and in conduct it was weak.  The\r\npolicy of that middle period in regard to paper money, to internal\r\nimprovements, in regard to the protection of domestic industry, and in\r\nregard to slavery has been set aside or overthrown by the better\r\njudgment of recent years.  Yet so much are statesmen and parties the\r\nservants or victims of events, that our opinions should be tolerant of\r\nthe men who kept the system in motion.  Slavery was an inheritance, and\r\ntime was required for its destruction.\r\n\r\nI returned to Massachusetts without waiting for the inauguration.\r\n\r\nAs I spoke in the convention upon the request of the Republican members\r\nof the New York delegation, and as the Representative of the\r\nMassachusetts delegation; and as my remarks were not criticized\r\nadversely by either party, I reproduce the speech as it was reported by\r\nMr. Chittenden:\r\n\r\nSPEECH IN PEACE CONVENTION\r\n\r\nI have not been at all clear in my own mind as to when, and to what\r\nextent, Massachusetts should raise her voice in this convention.  She\r\nhas heard the voice of Virginia, expressed through her resolutions, in\r\nthis crisis of our country's history.  Massachusetts hesitated, not\r\nbecause she was unwilling to respond to the call of Virginia, but\r\nbecause she thought her honor touched by the manner of that call and\r\nthe circumstances attending it.  She had taken part in the election of\r\nthe 6th of November.  She knew the result.  It accorded well with her\r\nwishes.  She knew that the government whose political head for the\r\nnext four years was then chosen was based upon a Constitution which she\r\nsupposed still had an existence.  She saw that State after State had\r\nleft that government,--seceded is the word used,--had gone out from\r\nthis great confederacy, and that they were defying the Constitution and\r\nthe Union.\r\n\r\nCharge after charge has been vaguely made against the North.  It is\r\nattempted here to put the North on trial.  I have listened with grave\r\nattention to the gentleman from Virginia to-day; but I have heard no\r\nspecification of these charges.  Massachusetts hesitated, I say:  she\r\nhas her own opinion of the Government and the Union.  I know\r\nMassachusetts; I have been into every one of her more than three\r\nhundred towns; I have seen and conversed with her men and her women;\r\nand I know there is not a man within her borders who would not to-day\r\ngladly lay down his life for the preservation of the Union.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts has made war upon slavery wherever she had the right to\r\ndo it; but, much as she _abhors_ the institution, she would sacrifice\r\neverything rather than assail it where she has not the right to assail\r\nit.\r\n\r\nCan it be denied, gentlemen, that we have elected a President in a\r\nlegal and constitutional way?  It cannot be denied; and yet you tell\r\nus, in tones that cannot be misunderstood, that, as a precedent\r\ncondition of his inauguration, we must give you these guarantees.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts hesitated, not because her blood was not stirred, but\r\nbecause she insisted that the government and the inauguration should go\r\nin the manner that would have been observed had Mr. Lincoln been\r\ndefeated.  She felt that she was touched in a tender point when invited\r\nhere under such circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is true, and I confess it frankly, that there are a few men at the\r\nNorth who have not yielded that support to the grand idea upon which\r\nthis confederated Union stands that they should have yielded; who have\r\nbeen disposed to infringe upon, to attack certain rights which the\r\nentire North, with these exceptions, accords to you.  But are you of\r\nthe South free from the like imputations?  The John Brown invasion was\r\nnever justified at the North.  If, in the excitement of the time, there\r\nwere those to be found who did not denounce it as gentlemen think they\r\nshould, it was because they knew it was a matter wholly outside the\r\nConstitution,--that it was a crime to which Virginia would give\r\nadequate punishment.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I believe--yes, I know--that the people of the North are as\r\ntrue to the government and the Union of the States now as our fathers\r\nwere when they stood shoulder to shoulder upon the field, fighting for\r\nthe principles upon which that Union rests.  If I thought the time had\r\ncome when it would be fit or proper to consider amendments to the\r\nConstitution at all, I believe that we should have no trouble with you,\r\nexcept upon this question of slavery in the Territories.  You cannot\r\ndemand of us at the North anything that we will not grant, unless it\r\ninvolves a sacrifice of our principles.  These we shall not sacrifice;\r\nthese you must not ask us to abandon.  I believe, further,--and I\r\nspeak in all frankness, for I wish to delude no one,--if the\r\nConstitution and the Union cannot be preserved and effectually\r\nmaintained without these new guarantees for slavery, then the Union is\r\nnot worth preserving.\r\n\r\nThe people of the North have always submitted to the decisions of the\r\nproperly constituted powers.  This obedience has been unpleasant\r\nenough when they thought those powers were exercised for sectional\r\npurposes; but it has always been implicitly yielded.  I am ready, even\r\nnow, to go home and say that, by the decision of the Supreme Court,\r\nslavery exists in all the Territories of the United States.  We submit\r\nto the decision, and accept its consequences.  But, in view of all the\r\ncircumstances attending that decision, was it quite fair, was it quite\r\ngenerous, for the gentleman from Maryland to say that under it, by the\r\nadoption of these propositions, the South was giving up everything, the\r\nNorth giving up nothing?  Does he suppose the South is yielding the\r\npoint in relation to any territory which, by any probability, would\r\nbecome slave territory?  Something more than the decision of the\r\nSupreme Court is necessary to establish slavery anywhere.  The decision\r\nmay give the _right_ to establish it:  other influences must control\r\nthe question of its actual establishment.\r\n\r\nI am opposed, further, to any restrictions on the acquisition of\r\nterritory.  They are unnecessary.  The time may come when they would\r\nbe troublesome.  We may want the Canadas.  The time may come when the\r\nCanadas may wish to unite with us.  Shall we tie up our hands so that\r\nwe cannot receive them, or make it forever your interest to oppose\r\ntheir annexation?  Such a restriction would be, by the common consent\r\nof the people, disregarded.\r\n\r\nThere are seven States out of the Union already.  They have organized\r\nwhat they claim is an independent government.  They are not to be\r\ncoerced back, you say.  Are the prospects very favorable that they will\r\nreturn of their own accord?  But _they_ will annex territory.  They are\r\nalready looking to Mexico.  If left to themselves, they would annex her\r\nand all her neighbors, and we should lose our highway to the Pacific\r\ncoast.  They would acquire it, and to us it would be lost forever.\r\n\r\nThe North will consider well before she consents to this, before she\r\neven permits it.  Ever since 1820, we have pursued, in this respect,\r\na uniform policy.  The North will hesitate long, before, by accepting\r\nthe condition you propose, she deprives the nation of the valuable\r\nprivilege, the unquestionable right, of acquiring new territory in an\r\nhonorable way.\r\n\r\nI have tried to look upon these propositions of the majority of the\r\ncommittee as true measures of pacification.  I have listened patiently\r\nto all that has been said in their favor.  But I am still unconvinced,\r\nor, rather, I am convinced that they will do nothing for the Union.\r\nThey will prove totally inadequate; may perhaps be positively\r\nmischievous.  The North, the free States, will not adopt them,--will\r\nnot consent to these new endorsements of an institution which they do\r\nnot like, which the believe to the injurious to the interests of the\r\nrepublic; and if they did adopt them, as they could only do by a\r\nsacrifice of principles which you should not expect, the South would\r\nnot be satisfied:  the slave States would not fail to find pretexts\r\nfor a course of action upon which I think they have already determined.\r\nI see in these propositions anything but true measures of pacification.\r\n\r\nBut the North will never consent to the separation of the States.  If\r\nthe South persist in the course on which she has entered, we shall\r\nmarch our armies to the Gulf of Mexico, or you will march yours to the\r\nGreat Lakes.  There can be no peaceful separation.  There is one way\r\nby which war may be avoided, and the Union preserved.  It is a plain\r\nand a constitutional way.  If the slave States will abandon the design\r\nwhich we must infer from the remarks of the gentleman from Virginia\r\nthey have already formed, will faithfully abide by their constitutional\r\nobligations, and remain in the union until their rights are in _fact_\r\ninvaded, all will be well.  But, if they take the responsibility of\r\ninvolving the country in a civil war, of breaking up the government\r\nwhich our fathers founded and our people love, but one course remains\r\nto those who are true to that government.  They must and will defend it\r\nat every sacrifice--if necessary, to the sacrifice of their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the close of the session, and upon the request of my associates upon\r\nthe commission, I wrote a report to Governor Andrew, which was signed\r\nby all the members of the delegation.  Governor Andrew submitted the\r\nreport, with his approval, to the Legislature the 25th day of March.\r\n\r\nThe character of the convention, and something of the condition of the\r\ncountry may be gathered from the following extracts from the report:\r\n\r\n\"The resolutions of the State of Virginia were passed on the 19th of\r\nJanuary; and it was expected that within sixteen days thereafter the\r\nrepresentatives of this vast country would assemble for the purpose of\r\ndevising, maturing, and recommending alterations in the Constitution of\r\nthe Republic.  As a necessary consequence, the people were not\r\nconsulted in any of the States.  In several, the commissioners were\r\nappointed by the executive of each without even an opportunity to\r\nconfer with the Legislature; in others, the consent of the\r\nrepresentative body was secured, but in no instance were the people\r\nthemselves consulted.  The measures proposed were comparatively new;\r\nthe important ones were innovations upon the established principles of\r\nthe Government, and none of them had ever been submitted to public\r\nscrutiny.  They related to the institution of slavery; and the\r\nexperience of the country justifies the assertion that any proposition\r\nfor additional securities to slavery under the flag of the nation,\r\nmust be fully discussed and well understood before its adoption, or it\r\nwill yield a fearful harvest of woe in dissentions and controversies\r\namong the people.  Nor could the undersigned have justified the act to\r\nthemselves, if they had concurred in asking Congress to propose\r\namendments to the Constitution unless they were prepared also to\r\nadvocate the adoption of the amendments by the people.\r\n\r\n\"It is due to truth to say that the Convention did not possess all the\r\ndesirable characteristics of a deliberative assembly.  It was in some\r\ndegree disqualified for the performance of the important task assigned\r\nto it, by the circumstances of its constitution, to which reference has\r\nbeen already made.  Moreover, there were members who claimed that\r\ncertain concessions must be granted that the progress of the secession\r\nmovement might be arrested; and on the other hand there were men who\r\neither doubted or denied the wisdom of such concessions.\r\n\r\n\"The circumstances were extraordinary.  Within the preceding ninety\r\ndays the integrity of the Union had been assailed by the attempt of\r\nsix States to overthrow its authority; seven other States were\r\ndisaffected, and some of them had assumed a menacing and even hostile\r\nattitude.  The political disturbances had been associated with or\r\nfollowed by financial distress.\r\n\r\n\"The Convention was then a body of men without a recognized and\r\nascertained constituency, called together in an exigency and without\r\npreparation, and invited to initiate measures for the amendment of the\r\nConstitution in most important particulars, and all at a moment when\r\nthe public mind was swayed by fears and alarms such as have never\r\nbefore been experienced by the American people.\r\n\r\n\"In these circumstances the undersigned thought it inexpedient to\r\npropose amendments to the Constitution, believing that so important an\r\nact should not be initiated and accomplished without the greatest\r\ndeliberation and care.  Nor could the undersigned satisfy themselves\r\nthat any or all of the proposed amendments would even tend, in any\r\nconsiderable degree, to the preservation of the Union.  Although\r\ninquiries were repeatedly made, no assurance was given that any\r\nproposition of amendment would secure the return of the seceded States;\r\nand it was admitted that several of the border States would ultimately\r\nunite with the Gulf States, either within or without the limits of the\r\nUnion, as might be dictated by events yet in the future.  Indeed, no\r\nproposition was in any degree acceptable to the majority of delegates\r\nfrom the border slave States that did not provide for the extension of\r\nslavery to the Territories, and its protection and security therein.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV\r\nTHE OPENING OF THE WAR\r\n\r\nWhen the call was made for seventy-five thousand men, the Sixth\r\nRegiment of Massachusetts was one of the first to respond.  On the\r\nnight of the 16th of April some, if not all, of the regiment, were\r\nquartered in Boston.  I called upon Company B, of Groton, then in the\r\nhall over the Williams Market.  I found that they understood that the\r\nmovement meant war and duty.  One of the men said to me:\r\n\r\n\"Some of us will never see Massachusetts again.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the affair in Baltimore on the 19th of April, Governor Andrew\r\nasked me to go to Washington with despatches for Mr. Lincoln and\r\nGeneral Scott.  The message was communicated to me through Mr. John M.\r\nForbes.  In his letter of request and appointment Governor Andrew said:\r\n\r\n\"We need your information, influence and acquaintance with the Cabinet,\r\nand knowledge of Eastern public sentiment, to leave immediately for\r\nWashington.  Hope you will proceed at once and open and preserve\r\ncommunication between you and myself.\"  This letter was dated April 22.\r\nUnder the same date the Governor wrote to President Lincoln:\r\n\r\n\"Ex-Governor Boutwell has been appointed Agent of the commonwealth to\r\nproceed to Washington to confer with you in regard to the forts in\r\nMassachusetts and the militia.\"  I was instructed also to see General\r\nWool in New York.  I received a package of letters, the contents of\r\nwhich were disclosed to me, one hundred dollars in gold, and a small\r\nrevolver loaded.*  I took with me a young man named Augustus Bixby,\r\nwho then lived in Groton, but who had seen something of the world,\r\nand was not daunted by the uncertainties of life.  He was afterwards\r\na cavalry officer.  During the war I one day read in the papers that\r\nBixby had been promoted for gallantry in an affair in the Shenandoah\r\nValley.  Within a few days after I met him in Washington on a crutch,\r\nor walking with the help of a cane.  He had been wounded in the\r\ncontest.  I said:\r\n\r\n\"Bixby, what did you do?\"  He replied:\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, except I sailed in.\"\r\n\r\nAt New York I telegraphed Vice-President Hamlin, then in Maine, that\r\nhe should come as far South as New York, that he might be in a\r\nsituation to act in case of the death or capture of Mr. Lincoln, of\r\nwhom we then knew nothing.  At New York, April 24, I telegraphed\r\nGovernor Andrew:\r\n\r\n\"General Wool and Vice-President Hamlin are in favor of your taking the\r\nresponsibility of sending two regiments to take charge of the forts,\r\nand to furnish and arm three vessels for the protection of the coast.\r\nYou can exercise the power, under the circumstance, better than anybody\r\nelse.\"  The same day I sent this dispatch:  \"Send without delay a\r\nsteamer with provisions for General Butler's command at Annapolis.\"\r\n\r\nAt Perryville, at the mouth of the Susquehanna, I sent Bixby with the\r\ndespatches by the first boat to Annapolis, with instructions to make\r\nhis way to Washington at the earliest moment.  I followed in the next\r\nboat.  Upon my arrival at General Butler's headquarters, I learned that\r\nBixby had left on foot.  As the troops were at work in re-laying the\r\ntrack, there was no danger.  Indeed, the small squads of men who had\r\nburned bridges and torn up tracks disappeared with the arrival of\r\ntroops.  At nine o'clock in the evening, a train, the first train,\r\ncarrying the New York Sixty-ninth Regiment, left for Annapolis\r\nJunction, at which place we arrived at one o'clock in the morning.\r\nThe only light upon the train was the headlight, and we moved only\r\nthe length of the train at each inspection of the road.  I made a\r\npillow of my small valise, and a bed of my blanket, and camped on the\r\nfloor of one of the small houses at Annapolis Junction.  In the morning\r\nI found Colonel Butterfield of the New York Twelfth and Colonel Scott,\r\na nephew of General Scott, who assumed the direction of affairs.  He\r\nafterwards joined the rebels.  I observed also that our encampment was\r\ncommanded by hills on the north and east, and Colonel Butterfield\r\ninformed me that the picket line was a long way inside the base of the\r\nhills.  At about six o'clock in the evening, a train with troops and\r\nthree civilians was made ready for Washington.  The American flag was\r\ndisplayed at many of the houses on the line of the road.\r\n\r\nI arrived in Washington the 27th day of April.  I annex a copy of a\r\nletter that I wrote to Governor Andrew the day following:\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, April 28, 1861.\r\nTo His Excellency Governor Andrew.\r\n\r\nSir:--I arrived in Washington to-day, after a journey of forty-eight\r\nhours from Philadelphia by Annapolis.  There have been no mails from\r\nthe North for a week; and you may easily understand that the mighty\r\npublic sentiment of the Free States is not yet fully appreciated here.\r\n\r\nThe President and Cabinet are gaining confidence; and the measures of\r\nthe Administration will no longer be limited to the defence of the\r\ncapital.  Secretary Welles has already sent orders to Captain Hudson\r\nto purchase six steamers, with instructions to consult you in regard\r\nto the matter.  I regret that the Secretary was not ready to put the\r\nmatter into the hands of commissioners, who would have acted\r\nefficiently and promptly.\r\n\r\nMr. Welles will accept, as a part of the quota, such vessels as may\r\nhave been purchased by Mr. Forbes.\r\n\r\nSenator Grimes of Iowa will probably give Mr. Crowninshield an order\r\nfor arms.  The United States Government may do the same; but no\r\ndefinite action has yet been taken.\r\n\r\nMartial law will be proclaimed here to-morrow.  Colonel Mansfield will\r\nbe appointed general, and assigned to this district.  He is one of the\r\nmost efficient officers in the country.\r\n\r\nBaltimore is to be closed in from Havre-de-Grace, from the Relay House,\r\nfrom the Carlisle line, and by an efficient naval force.  She will be\r\nreduced to unconditional submission.  The passage of the troops through\r\nMaryland has had a great moral effect.  The people are changing rapidly\r\nin the country places.  Many instances of a popular revolution, in\r\ntowns through which troops have passed or been stationed, have come to\r\nmy knowledge.  I came to Washington with the Twelfth New York Regiment;\r\nand from Annapolis Junction there were cheers from three fourths of the\r\nhouses by the wayside.\r\n\r\nEverything appears well at Annapolis, where General Butler commands in\r\nperson.  There is a large body of troops, the people are gradually\r\ngaining confidence in the army and the Government, and the regulations\r\nseem to be effective.  General Butler is popular with the officers whom\r\nI met.  He has taken command of the highlands that command the town and\r\nthe encampment.  All sorts of rumors are spread among the troops\r\nconcerning an attack upon the Annapolis Station; but the place can be\r\ndefended under any conceivable circumstances.  I am sorry to say, that\r\neverything is in confusion at Annapolis Junction, and a moderate force\r\nmight, in a single night, break off the connection of this city with\r\nthe North.  Each colonel, as he moves towards Washington, commands for\r\ntwelve or twenty-four hours.  My own belief, however, is, that Maryland\r\nwill never see two thousand men together as a military organization\r\nin opposition to the Government.\r\n\r\nI presume that your Excellency has means of obtaining information\r\nconcerning the condition of Massachusetts men, morally and physically;\r\nbut, as I am here, I shall try to obtain and transmit any information\r\nthat seems important.  I may say now, that the Eighth Regiment is\r\nquartered in the rotunda of the Capitol; and a military man, not of\r\nMassachusetts, says, that they are already suffering from the cold\r\nand dampness of the place.  He advises tents and out-door encampment.\r\n\r\nI repeat what is every hour and in my hearing, that Massachusetts\r\nhas taken her place at the head of the column in support of the\r\nGovernment; and our regiments are everywhere esteemed as noble examples\r\nof citizen soldiers.  I, for one, feel anxious that everything that is\r\nproper should be done.\r\n\r\nI have written this communication in great haste; and I have only time\r\nto subscribe myself your Excellency's obedient servant.\r\n\r\nGEORGE S. BOUTWELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day I called upon General Scott.  It was apparent that he was\r\nin no condition to organize or lead armies.  He was lying upon a\r\nlounge, and when he arose he walked with his hand upon his hip and gave\r\nan account of his wound at the battle of Lundy's Lane.  He was national\r\nin his views of duty, and he spoke with earnestness in reprobation of\r\nthe conduct of Virginia.  He spoke also of the efforts that had been\r\nmade to induce him to go with his State.  He seemed like a man without\r\nhope, but there were no indications of a lack of fidelity to the\r\ncountry.  Aside from the circumstance that he was a native of Virginia\r\nand that Virginia was engaged in the Rebellion, it was too much to\r\nexpect that at his age he could cope with so formidable a movement\r\nas the rebellion of eleven States.  While I was in Washington I\r\npresented to General Scott a young man, Henry S. Briggs, a son of\r\nex-Governor Briggs, whom General Scott had known when Governor Briggs\r\nwas in Congress.  Young Briggs was a lieutenant in the Berkshire\r\nregiment, then on duty in Washington.  He wished for a corresponding\r\nappointment in the regular army.  This appointment General Scott\r\nsecured for him.  Afterwards he became colonel of a Massachusetts\r\nregiment of volunteers and at the end of the war he was a brigadier-\r\ngeneral of volunteers.\r\n\r\nI left Washington for Massachusetts May 1.  I was delayed a night and\r\nuntil four o'clock the day following at Annapolis, where General Butler\r\nwas in command.  I had my quarters with him, and during the night the\r\nlong roll was beaten.  The troops came out, and I waited for the\r\nresult, which was the discovery that the call was due to a\r\nmisunderstanding of the signal rockets.  I left Annapolis in a small\r\nsteam tug that came out of the Raritan Canal.  We were buffeted about\r\nin the bay by a heavy wind, the captain lost his reckoning, anchored,\r\nand the next morning we found ourselves uncomfortably near to the\r\nMaryland shore.\r\n\r\nThe next day, May 2, I reached New York and from there I sent the\r\nfollowing letter to Governor Andrew:\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, May 2, 1861.\r\n\r\nSir:--I arrived here this afternoon, and I hope to report to you in\r\nperson Saturday.  I had free conversation with the President, General\r\nScott, Mr. Seward, Mr. Chase, General Cameron, and Mr. Blair, upon\r\npublic affairs.  The impression I received from all, except perhaps\r\nMr. Seward, was favorable to a vigorous prosecution of the war.  Mr.\r\nSeward repeated his words of December and February.  \"The crisis is\r\nover.\"  It is, however, understood at Washington that Mr. Seward\r\nfavors vigorous measures.  Mr. Chase says that the policy of the\r\nAdministration is vigorous and comprehensive, as sure to succeed in\r\ncontrolling the Rebellion, and preserving the whole territory of the\r\nUnion.  I will only say now, that I left Washington with a more\r\nfavorable impression of the policy of the Government than I entertained\r\nwhen I left Boston.\r\n\r\nGeneral Cameron agreed to authorize Massachusetts to raise two\r\nregiments in addition to that of Dwight.  The papers were all made, and\r\nonly a Cabinet meeting prevented their completion on Tuesday.  I did\r\nnot wish to remain another day, and I left the papers with the chief\r\nclerk; and I also received the assurance of Colonel Ripley, that he\r\nwould give personal and prompt attention to transmitting them to\r\nBoston.  I shall expect them on Sunday.\r\n\r\nColonel Ripley issued an order on Tuesday for rifling cannon.  Mr.\r\nForbes' letter aided very much.\r\n\r\nI am truly your most obedient servant,\r\nGEORGE S. BOUTWELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was in Washington again in the month of May, and I made a third visit\r\nthe second day after the first battle of Bull Run.  At one of these\r\nvisits I met General Hooker, at Mr. Sumner's quarters on F. Street.  He\r\nhad then recently arrived from California and his appearance indicated\r\npoverty.  His dress was worn, and his apparel was that of a decayed man\r\nof the world.  He had called upon Senator Sumner to secure his aid in\r\nobtaining the command of a Massachusetts regiment, he being a\r\nMassachusetts man by birth.  In the course of the conversation Hooker\r\nsaid that if he could obtain a regiment, he would come to the command\r\nof the army, and take Richmond.  When he came to the command of the\r\narmy it seemed possible that his vain boast might be fulfilled in both\r\nparticulars.  The cause of his failure may be the subject of debate,\r\nbut, at Chancellorsville, his orders were not obeyed.  It is probable,\r\nhowever, that Hooker lacked the qualities of a great commander.  He\r\ninspired his soldiers with enthusiasm, he was brave, and his heart was\r\nin the cause.  With many faults, he was one of the great soldiers of\r\nthe war, and with less sensitiveness of spirit he might have been one\r\nof its renowned chieftains.\r\n\r\nI have obtained from the War Department copies of two letters that I\r\nwrote to Gen. Cameron, Secretary of War, dated at Havre de Grace,\r\nApril 26, 1861.  They throw some light on the war movements at that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nHAVRE DE GRACE, _April_ 26, 1861.\r\nHON. SIMON CAMERON:\r\n\r\n_Sir:_  I have written upon the letter of Governor Andrew which Mr.\r\nBixby will hand to you.\r\n\r\nI cannot too strongly impress upon the Government the importance of\r\nauthorizing Governor Andrew to procure three steamers for the\r\nprotection of the coast and to aid in a blockade of the southern ports.\r\nThe New York merchants are anxious to do the same.  I hope you will\r\ngrant the order.  Governor Andrew will put the work of preparation\r\ninto the hands of our best merchants, who will charge no commissions\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nThe whole North is wild and determined in its enthusiasm.  Should not\r\nthe Government make another requisition?  They will be needed, I fear,\r\nand a short and vigorous campaign round Washington will be advantageous\r\nin the highest degree.\r\n\r\nI am, very truly, your obedient servant,\r\nGEORGE S. BOUTWELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAVRE DE GRACE, _April_ 26, 1861.\r\nHON. SIMON CAMERON:\r\n\r\n_Sir:_  I have obtained an order from General Wool to garrison the\r\nforts and arsenals, but it is of the utmost importance to obtain\r\nauthority to purchase at least three steamers and equip them for coast\r\ndefense.  This can be done at a moderate cost and the merchants of\r\nBoston are anxious to secure so great a protection to commerce.  They\r\ncan be used effectively upon the Southern coast.  I trust that you will\r\ntransmit an order to Governor Andrew by the bearer of this, Mr.\r\nAugustus H. Bixby.\r\n\r\nI am, your obedient servant,\r\nGEORGE S. BOUTWELL.\r\n\r\n\r\n[* This revolver gave me and my friend, Ebenezer F. Stone, then\r\nAdjutant-General of the State, more anxiety than all things else\r\nconnected with the expedition.  It never occurred to me to return the\r\npistol.  I discharged the barrels and laid the weapon away, only too\r\nglad to have it out of sight.  Some years after the war, the Adjutant-\r\nGeneral's department was investigated, and a shortage of arms was\r\ndiscovered.  I received a letter asking me if I had a pistol belonging\r\nto the State.  I returned the weapon which I neither wanted nor needed,\r\nand to that extent I relieved General Stone.]\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI\r\nTHE MILITARY COMMISSION OF 1862 AND GENERAL FREMONT\r\n\r\nIn the month of May, or early in June 1862, I received a message from\r\nMr. Stanton asking me to report in Washington, prepared to serve upon\r\na commission at Cairo, Illinois.  Upon arriving at Washington, I was\r\ninformed that it would be the duty of the commission to examine claims\r\nthat might be preferred against the Government, from the States of\r\nMissouri, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio.  These claims had\r\narisen from the operations of General Fremont and they were of great\r\nvariety.  At the end the commission were of the opinion that he was\r\nan expensive commander.  Charles A. Dana was chairman of the\r\ncommission, and Judge Logan, of Springfield, Illinois, an old friend\r\nof President Lincoln, was my associate.  The health of Judge Logan\r\nsoon failed, and he was succeeded by Mr. Cullom, afterwards Governor\r\nof Illinois, and a member of the United States Senate.\r\n\r\nOur life at Cairo was disagreeable to an extent that cannot be\r\nrealized easily.  In the months of June and July the weather was\r\nextremely hot.  The army of General Grant had quartered in and around\r\nthe town during the preceding winter.  The larger portion of the town\r\ninside of the levee, had been covered with water to the depth of\r\nseveral feet.  Much of the refuse of the army, including some dead\r\nanimals, had been left upon the surface of the ground.  Sickness was\r\ngeneral among the inhabitants.  Health was the exception.  We had our\r\nquarters upon the levee, and before a long time had passed we\r\norganized a mess with General Strong, the officer in command at that\r\npoint.  For myself I drank only tea and water from Iowa ice.  With this\r\ndrink and a moderate diet, I preserved my health.  It was our fate\r\neach evening to witness and endure a collision of the thunder showers,\r\none coming down the Mississippi, and the other down the Ohio.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon we had the benefit of a trip upon a Government\r\nboat up the Ohio as far as Mound City.  Once of a Sunday we made a\r\ntrip to Columbus, Kentucky, then in command of General Quimby, of New\r\nYork.  We there met General Dodge, afterward a member of Congress from\r\nIowa and subsequently a successful railway operator.\r\n\r\nAt Columbus we had a collation on the boat, where speeches were made by\r\nofficers and civilians, in support of the war and for emancipation.\r\nOn our return to Cairo, we were met by the customary evening shower, an\r\nunwelcome attendant upon a steamboat excursion.\r\n\r\nMy acquaintance with Mr. Dana gave me a high opinion of his business\r\nhabits and faculties, and when General Grant became President and I was\r\nin charge of the Treasury, I urged the President to appoint Mr. Dana\r\ncollector of the port of New York.  The President had already selected\r\nMr. Grinnell, but whether he had communicated the fact to Mr. Grinnell\r\nI never knew.  Moreover, the President had formed an unfavorable\r\nopinion of Mr. Dana, arising from some intercourse during the war.\r\nConsequently, my advice was unavailing.  The President said, however,\r\nthat I might offer him the post of chief appraiser of the port of New\r\nYork.  The offer was declined; and from that time forward Mr. Dana was\r\nthe President's bitter enemy.  As another result, there was no further\r\ncommunication between Mr. Dana and myself.  Once I saw him upon a\r\nsteamer, but we did not recognize each other.  In the year 1887, in\r\nconsequence of a paragraph in the New York _Sun_ in which my name was\r\nmentioned, not unkindly, I wrote a brief note to Mr. Dana.  Without\r\ndelay I received from him a long and almost affectionate letter, in\r\nwhich he urged me to let him know when I was in New York, that he might\r\ncall upon me, and talk over some things old, and some things new.\r\n\r\nI called upon him in New York at his office, where we had a pleasant\r\nchat of an hour.  His office was plain, without carpets, the floor\r\nwas worn rough, rather than smooth, and the appearance of the rooms\r\nwas a striking contrast to the editorial rooms of prosperous\r\njournalists generally.\r\n\r\nMy experience at Cairo gave me a poor opinion of Fremont's qualities as\r\na business man, but in the early part of his career he had exhibited\r\ncapacity of a high order as a bold and successful explorer of the then\r\nunknown regions of the Rocky Mountains.  He had also exhibited genius\r\nas a soldier, which led to high expectations which were not realized\r\nwhen he came to important commands in the Civil War.  My studied\r\nopinion of General Fremont is contained in an article that I prepared\r\nfor the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, of which society he was\r\nan honorary member:\r\n\r\nARTICLE ON GENERAL FREMONT\r\n\r\nIt is a singular circumstance in the career of John C. Fremont that\r\nhis important services as an explorer and his contributions to science\r\nwere brought to a close when he was scarcely more than thirty-four\r\nyears of age.  He was born in the State of Georgia in the year 1813,\r\nand from the year 1842 to the year 1846 inclusive, he undertook and\r\ncarried to a successful result three expeditions from the Mississippi\r\nRiver across the plains, and finally over both chains of the Rocky\r\nMountains to the Pacific Ocean.  Mr. Jefferson, during his\r\nadministration had realized the importance of securing \"open over-land\r\ncommercial relations with Asia,\" as stated in one of his messages to\r\nCongress, and, as a preparation for establishing such relations with\r\nAsia, he originated and organized the expedition of Lewis and Clark,\r\nwhose duty it was to trace the affluents of the Columbia River now\r\nknown as Snake River and Clarke's Fork.\r\n\r\nFremont's early education was obtained under the charge largely of Dr.\r\nJohn Roberton, a Scotchman, who had been educated at Edinburgh, and who\r\nhad established himself at Charleston, S. C., as a teacher of the\r\nancient languages.  Dr. Roberton says that in the space of a year\r\nFremont read four books of Caesar, six books of Vergil, nearly all of\r\nHorace, and two books of Livy; and in Greek, all the Graeca Minora,\r\nabout half of the Graeca Majora, and four books of Homer's Iliad.  At\r\nthe end of a year he entered the Junior Class of Charleston College,\r\nwhere he gained high standing for study and in scholarship; but for\r\ninsubordination he was expelled from the college.\r\n\r\nIn 1833 he was appointed teacher of mathematics in the Navy, and made\r\na cruise to South America, which occupied about two and a half years\r\nof time.  While absent, a law was passed creating the office of\r\nprofessor of mathematics in the Navy, for which Fremont upon his return\r\nwas examined, and appointed.  Without entering upon the duties of the\r\nplace, he declined the position, and accepted the post of surveyor and\r\nrailroad engineer upon the railway line between Charleston and Augusta.\r\nIn 1838 and 1839 he was associated with M. Nicollet, a Frenchman and a\r\nmember of the Academy of Science, in an exploring expedition over the\r\nNorthwestern prairie and along the valley of the Mississippi.  During\r\nhis absence, he was appointed by President Van Buren a second\r\nlieutenant in the corps of topographical engineers.  Upon his return\r\nfrom the Upper Mississippi, and for the period of a year, he was\r\nengaged with Nicollet and Mr. Hassler, then the head of the Coast\r\nSurvey, in the arrangement of the scientific materials that had been\r\ncollected during the expedition, and in the preparation of a map and\r\na report.  In 1842 he was directed by Colonel Abert, the chief of the\r\ntopographical corps, to make an exploration of the Northwestern\r\nfrontier of the State of Missouri to the Rocky Mountains, and with\r\nspecial reference to an examination of what was known as South Pass in\r\nthose mountains.  This expedition was on a small scale, consisting of\r\ntwenty-one men only, most of whom were of French extraction.  In this\r\nexpedition he traced the waters of the Platte to the South Pass, which\r\nhe reached the 8th of August.  It was stated by Dr. Linn, then a\r\nSenator from the State of Missouri, that \"over the whole course of the\r\nroad barometrical observations were made by Mr. Fremont to ascertain\r\nthe elevations both of the plains and of the mountains, astronomical\r\nobservations were made to ascertain latitudes and longitudes, the\r\nface of the country was marked as arable or sterile, the facility of\r\ntraveling and the practicability of routes noted, the grand features\r\nof nature described and some represented in drawings, military\r\npositions indicated, and a large contribution to geology and botany\r\nwas made in varieties of plants, flowers, shrubs, trees and grasses,\r\nand rocks and earths, which were enumerated.\"  The second expedition\r\nof May, 1843, was upon a larger scale, and it was not completed until\r\nthe month of July, 1844.  He was directed to extend his survey across\r\nthe continent, on the line of travel between the State of Missouri and\r\nthe tide-water region of the Columbia.\r\n\r\nIn its execution, much more ground was covered than had been\r\ncontemplated in the order.  Fremont was the first person that visited\r\nthe basin of the Great Salt Lake who was able to furnish a scientific\r\nand accurate description of the region.  Von Humboldt, in his work\r\nentitled \"Aspects of Nature\" (pp. 32-34) has given a summary of the\r\nresults reached by Fremont in his first and second expeditions, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"Fremont's map and geographical researches embrace the immense tract\r\nof land extending from the confluence of the Kansas River with the\r\nMissouri to the cataracts of the Columbia, and the missions of Santa\r\nBarbara and the Pueblo de los Angeles in New California, presenting a\r\nspace amounting to 28 degrees of longitude (about 1,300 miles) between\r\nthe 34th and 35th parallels of north latitude.  Four hundred points\r\nhave been hypsometrically determined by barometrical measurements, and\r\nfor the most part astronomically; so that it has been rendered possible\r\nto delineate the profile above the sea's level of a tract of land\r\nmeasuring 3,600 miles, with all its inflections, extending from the\r\nnorth of Kansas to Fort Vancouver and to the coasts of the South Sea\r\n(almost 720 miles more than the distance from Madrid to Tobolsk).  As\r\nI believe I was the first who attempted to represent, in geognostic\r\nprofile, the configuration of Mexico, and the Cordilleras of South\r\nAmerica,--for the half-perspective projections of the Siberian\r\ntraveler, the Abbe Chappe* were based upon mere, and for the most part\r\non very inaccurate, estimates of the falls of rivers,--it has afforded\r\nme special satisfaction to there find the graphical method of\r\nrepresenting the earth's configuration in a vertical direction, that\r\nis, the elevation of a solid over fluid parts, achieved on so vast a\r\nscale.  In the mean latitude of 37 degrees to 43 degrees, the Rocky\r\nMountains present, besides the great snow-crowned summits, whose height\r\nmay be compared to that of the Peak of Teneriffe, elevated plateaux of\r\nan extent scarcely to be met with in any other part of the world, and\r\nwhose breadth from east to west is almost twice that of the Mexican\r\nhighlands.  From the range of mountains which being a little westward\r\nof Fort Laramie, to the farther side of the Wasatch Mountains, the\r\nelevation of the soil is uninterruptedly maintained from 5,000 to\r\nupwards of 7,000 feet above the sea level; nay, this elevated portion\r\noccupies the whole space between the true Rocky Mountains and the\r\nCalifornian snowy coast range from 34 degrees to 45 degrees north\r\nlatitude.  This district, which is a kind of broad longitudinal valley,\r\nlike that of Lake Titicaca, has been named the _Great Basin_ by Joseph\r\nWalker and Captain Fremont, travelers well acquainted with those\r\nwestern regions.  It is a _terra incognita_ of at least 128,000 English\r\nsquare miles, almost uninhabited, and full of salt lakes, the largest\r\nof which is 3,940 Parisian (or 4,200 English) feet above the level of\r\nthe sea, and is connected with the narrow Lake Utah,** into which the\r\n'Rock River' (_Timpan Ogo_ in the Utah language) pours its copious\r\nstream.\"\r\n\r\nFremont's third expedition was commenced August 16, 1845, under\r\ninstructions to explore the interior of the region known as the Great\r\nBasin, and the maritime ports of Oregon and California.  The first\r\nimportant incident of that expedition was the message of General\r\nCastro, ordering Fremont to leave the Territory.  This was in the\r\nmonth of March, 1846.  At the moment, Fremont refused to obey the\r\norder, and proceeded to fortify his camp, where he raised the United\r\nState flag, and remained for about three days.  On further\r\nconsideration, however, he left his camp and proceeded north towards\r\nOregon.  In the early part of the month of May he was overtaken by a\r\nmessenger named Neal, who informed him that Lieutenant Gillespie, an\r\nagent of the Government at Washington, was on his way, charged with\r\nthe delivery of letters, and with verbal instructions from the\r\nauthorities.  Upon receipt of this information, Fremont changed his\r\ncourse, and on the second day met Gillespie, who brought only a letter\r\nof introduction from the Secretary of State, Mr. Buchanan, with letters\r\nand papers from Senator Benton.  From Gillespie he learned that it was\r\nthe purpose of the authorities to ascertain the disposition of the\r\ninhabitants of California, to conciliate their feelings in favor of\r\nthe United States, and to counteract as far as possible any designs of\r\nthe British Government upon that Territory.  Fremont made his way to\r\nthe settled parts of California, near Monterey, where he found\r\nCommodore Sloat in command of a United States fleet.  In co-operation\r\nwith him and largely through Fremont's agency, the Mexican authorities\r\nwere dispersed, the flag of the United States was raised at Monterey\r\nand other points, and all was accomplished before information was\r\nreceived of the existence of war between the United States and Mexico.\r\nThese proceedings were justified by the Government of the United\r\nStates.  In the month of December following, Brigadier-General S. W.\r\nKearny arrived in the Territory, and ultimately there was a conflict\r\nbetween him and Commodore Stockton, who had succeeded Commodore Sloat,\r\nas to the command of the forces in California.  Until the arrival of\r\nKearny, Fremont had been acting under the orders of Commodore\r\nStockton, had raised troops, and had received from him the appointment\r\nof Governor of the Territory.  General Kearny, in asserting his\r\nauthority as commander-in-chief, ordered Fremont to raise troops and\r\nsubmit himself to his orders.  This Fremont declined to do, giving as\r\nhis reason that he had acted under Commodore Stockton, that it was\r\ntheir duty to adjust their differences, and that until they had done\r\nso, he should act under the orders of Commodore Stockton.  This course\r\non his part led to his arrest while on his way to Washington, and his\r\ntrial by a court martial upon three charges:  \"1st, mutiny; 2nd,\r\ndisobedience of orders; and 3d, conduct prejudicial to good order and\r\ndiscipline.\"  On these charges he was convicted, and sentenced by the\r\ncourt martial to be dismissed from the service.  Six of the officers\r\nwho were of the court recommended him to the clemency of the President.\r\nThe President disapproved of the findings of the court as to the charge\r\nof mutiny, but expressed the opinion that the second and third charges\r\nwere sustained by the proofs; but that, in consideration of the\r\nvaluable services of Lieutenant Colonel Fremont, the penalty of\r\ndismissal from the service was remitted.  When the findings of the\r\ncourt were announced, and the action of the President was made known to\r\nFremont, he wrote a letter to the Adjutant-General resigning his\r\ncommission as Lieutenant-Colonel of the Army, and giving as a reason\r\nthat he could not, by accepting the clemency of the President, admit\r\nthe justice of the sentence.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy, from a legal point of view, to justify the action of\r\nthe President.  If the conduct of Fremont in refusing to recognize the\r\nauthority of General Kearny was an offence, it must have rested upon\r\nthe fact that Kearny exhibited to him evidence which should have\r\nsatisfied a reasonable person that he had authority from the President\r\nto take command of the military forces in California; and if such\r\nauthority was exhibited to Fremont and he refused obedience, his\r\nrefusal constituted the crime of mutiny.  The other offences charged\r\nagainst Fremont would have followed as a matter of course; but in the\r\nabsence of proof that he was guilty of mutiny, there was no evidence\r\nwhatever on which the minor charges could be sustained.  Thus ended\r\nFremont's military services and his career as an explorer when he was\r\nless than thirty-four years of age.\r\n\r\nFremont's subsequent career may be considered under three heads.\r\nFirst, in business affairs, in which, apparently, he was unsuccessful.\r\nNext, he was the first candidate of the Republican Party for the office\r\nof President of the United States.  His acceptance of the nomination,\r\nand his letters and statements touching the policy and purposes of the\r\nnew organization were not merely formal, but they were pronounced\r\ndeclarations in favor of the movement, with clear expressions in\r\nharmony with the object of the party, which was the prevention of the\r\nextension of slavery in the Territories.  Although a Southern man by\r\nbirth his devotion to the freedom of the Territories was as ardent as\r\nthat of Lincoln, or any of the other leaders of the time.  Finally, in\r\nthe Civil War, he made a tender of his services to the Government, and\r\nas Major-General, and in command of the forces in the Department of\r\nMissouri, he issued a proclamation of emancipation of the slaves within\r\nhis jurisdiction.  This proclamation was countermanded by the\r\nPresident, and for the sufficient reason that he reserved to himself\r\nthe absolute control of the question of the abolition of slavery in the\r\nseceding States and within the lines of our armies.  It cannot be said\r\nthat Fremont's military career was marked by any signal successes, but\r\nthere can be no doubt of his ardent devotion to the cause of his country.\r\n\r\n[* Chappe d'Auteroche, \"Voyage en Sibirie,\" fait en 1761, 4 vols.,\r\n4th ed., Paris, 1768.\r\n\r\n** Fremont \"Report of the Exploring Expedition,\" pp. 154 and 273-276.]\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII\r\nORGANIZATION OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\nBefore the work at Cairo was finished I received a message from Mr.\r\nChase, Secretary of the Treasury, asking me to come to Washington and\r\ntake charge of the Internal Revenue Office, or rather, to organize it\r\nunder a statute then recently passed, but which I had not seen.  After\r\na conversation with Mr. Dana, who advised me to accept the place, I\r\nreturned to Washington, where I arrived July 16, 1862.  After an\r\ninterview with Mr. Chase I took the oath of office before Mr. Justice\r\nWayne of the Supreme Court.  He was then aged and that fact may have\r\ndeterred him from following the example of his younger associate,\r\nJustice Campbell, who resigned his office, and joined in the work of\r\nsecession.  Judge Wayne was disposed to conversation, but he made no\r\nallusion to the war and the issues involved.\r\n\r\nI was assigned to a small room on the first floor of the Treasury\r\nbuilding, on the right of the lower door fronting on Pennsylvania\r\nAvenue.  First, I read the statute and formed for myself an idea of\r\nthe process by which the machine was to be set in motion.  The statute\r\nwas a remarkable exhibition of legislative wisdom under the\r\ncircumstances, but it was incomplete in parts rather than imperfect in\r\nplan.  In the course of two or three days Mr. Chase assigned to me\r\nthree clerks from other offices in the Treasury, and all of them were\r\nvery competent assistants--Mr. Estes, Mr. George Parnell, and Mr. A. B.\r\nJohnson.  The order of assignment I do not recall.  Mr. Estes went to\r\nNew York in a few months, where he engaged in business.  Mr. Parnell\r\nremained in the department many years and until his death.  Mr. Johnson\r\nwas subsequently transferred to the Lighthouse Board, of which he is\r\nthe chief clerk.\r\n\r\nWe first considered what blanks would be needed to enable assessors\r\nand collectors to perform their duties and make proper records and\r\nreturns.  Then we devised the books for the local offices, and for the\r\noffices in Washington.  There was but one error as tested by experience\r\nin the preparations of the blanks and books, and the forms were\r\nfollowed in the department, except so far as changes in the law\r\nrequired alteration.  Thus far there has never been a fraud or\r\ndefalcation that was attributable to inadequate checks in the system.\r\nWhile I was at the head of the office, Mr. Chase never required me to\r\nretain a clerk who was incompetent or untrustworthy.  There were times,\r\nhowever, when he looked to appointments with reference to Presidential\r\npreferences, and he always considered himself in the line of succession.\r\n\r\nMr. Chase's mental processes were slow, but time being given, he had\r\nthe capacity to form sound opinions.  Not infrequently, when I called\r\nat his office for conference, he would say:  \"My mind is preoccupied--\r\nyou must either decide for yourself, or call again.\"  As a result, he\r\nnever gave an opinion or tendered any advice in relation to the\r\nbusiness of the Internal Revenue Office while I was at the head of it.\r\nMr. Chase had only a limited knowledge of the business of the\r\ndepartment.  Indeed, only a very extraordinary man could have\r\nadministered the business of the department systematically, with a\r\ndaily or frequent knowledge of the doings of the many heads of bureaus\r\nand divisions, and at the same time have matured and put into\r\noperation, the financial measures which were required by the exigencies\r\nof the war.\r\n\r\nMr. Chase's three great measures were the Abolition of State Banks\r\nand the substitution of the National Banking System, the issue of the\r\nUnited States legal tender notes, and the issue of the Five-Twenty\r\nBonds.  In combination, as a financial system, they enabled the country\r\nto carry a debt of three thousand million dollars, and it is probable\r\nthat a debt of six thousand million would not have paralyzed the\r\npublic credit.  It is an instance of the frailty of human nature, when\r\nmen are in the presence of great temptations, that when he became\r\nChief Justice of the United States, he announced the opinion that the\r\nissue of United States legal tender notes was unconstitutional.  That\r\nmeasure was the key to his financial system, and a measure\r\nindispensable to the prosecution of the war.  It was a forced loan, but\r\nin an exigency a government has as good a right to force capital into\r\nthe public service as to force men.  If in 1862 Mr. Chase had acted\r\nupon the doctrine set forth in his judicial opinion in the Hepburn\r\nand Griswold case, the probability is that the government of Mr.\r\nLincoln would have been reduced financially to an equality with the\r\ngovernment of the Confederate States.  The ultimate reversal of that\r\nopinion is the most important act of the Supreme Court.  It gives to\r\nthe political department of the Government, the power to convert all\r\nthe resources of the country into the means of defence in time of war,\r\nforeign or domestic.\r\n\r\nWhile I held the office of commissioner of internal revenue, I had\r\noccasion to consult Mr. Bates, the Attorney-General.  He was a kind\r\nhearted gentleman, but lacking in vigor and official independence.\r\n\r\nThere was no provision in the statute for a cashier.  The law\r\ncontemplated that the money would be paid to the commissioner.  As it\r\nwas impossible for me to perform that duty personally, I asked Mr.\r\nChase for authority to appoint Mr. Marshall Conant, who had been and\r\nperhaps then was principal of the Normal School, at Bridgewater, Mass.,\r\na clerk in the office, and assign him to duty as cashier.  He was\r\nappointed to a twelve hundred dollar clerkship, from which he was\r\nadvanced to fourteen and then to sixteen hundred dollars.  From\r\nSeptember 1, 1862, to March 3, 1863, he collected and accounted for\r\nabout thirty-seven million dollars, without any other security than his\r\nown good name, and all for a compensation of about eight hundred\r\ndollars.  I urged Congress to make some adequate compensation, but the\r\nrequest was neglected.  When I was in the Senate, I renewed the effort\r\nin behalf of his widow, but the attempt was a failure.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the office was effected by systematic processes.\r\nFrom manufacturers, from assessors and collectors, and from other\r\ninterested parties numerous inquiries came to the office.  The letters\r\ncontaining these inquiries were thrown into a basket, and reserved for\r\nthe evening sessions, at which the heads of divisions--as divisions were\r\ncreated--were required to attend.  These letters were read at the\r\nconferences, and when a conclusion was reached, the letter containing\r\nthe inquiry was put aside for answer.  The other letters were held for\r\nfurther consideration.  All unanswered letters were read and considered\r\nevery evening.  Letters often remained unanswered for days, and perhaps\r\nfor weeks, but at length the answer would be reached.  By this process\r\nthe decisions were rendered harmonious.  I had the aid of two short-\r\nhand writers, and between 8:30 and 10 A. M., I was able usually to\r\ndictate the answers and in sufficient quantity to occupy the short-hand\r\nwriters till 3 o'clock P. M., when the answers were submitted to me.\r\nThese I read, corrected and signed.  They were then referred to the\r\nrespective divisions for future guidance.  Thereafter all inquiries\r\nwhich had been so answered, were treated as routine business, and the\r\nletters in reply were signed without inquiry by clerks or by myself.\r\nThus it happened that we were not often compelled to reverse our\r\nrulings, and generally they were sustained by the courts.\r\n\r\nMr. S. M. Clark, then superintendent of the Bureau of Printing, was\r\ngreatly disappointed when I decided to reject all his designs for\r\nstamps, and required him to introduce the likeness of Washington after\r\nStuart into each stamp.  As far as I know, the internal revenue stamps\r\nwere never approved or criticized by the critics nor by the public.\r\nAfter advertisement a contract was made with Messrs. Butler and\r\nCarpenter, of Philadelphia, to furnish the stamps of all sizes, and\r\nto meet the expense of the engraving, at the rate of thirteen cents\r\nper thousand.  In the year 1873 I received from Mr. Carpenter an album\r\nwhich contained proof specimens of every internal revenue adhesive\r\nstamp, public and private, engraved and printed, previous to March,\r\n1873.  This volume may contain the only complete collection of stamps\r\nissued from the Internal Revenue Office previous to that year.\r\n\r\nWhen we were about to make appointments of assessors, and of collectors\r\nof internal revenue, Mr. Thurlow Weed called at the office, and said\r\nthat if I would allow him to see the New York papers he would give me\r\nhis opinion of the qualifications of the candidates, and any facts\r\nwithin his knowledge.  This he did, and with entire fairness, as I\r\nnow believe.  He distinguished between the Seward men and the opponents\r\nof Seward, treating their merits and weaknesses without prejudice or\r\nfeeling.  Again, when the collectors' bonds had been filed, he examined\r\nthem, and under his advice, the principals, in several cases, were\r\nrequired to add to the strength of the security.  Mr. Chase took no\r\npart in the appointment of collectors and assessors, beyond the\r\ndesignation of two collectors, one in Ohio, and one in Massachusetts,\r\nwith whom he was acquainted.  Mr. Lincoln also designated two, one in\r\nIllinois and one in California, and for the same reason.  Of these,\r\nthree proved unworthy.  They may have assumed upon the way of their\r\nappointment, as security against discipline or removal.  The rest were\r\nappointed upon written recommendations, and for the most part the\r\nduties were well performed to the end of their terms, and some of them\r\nheld their places for more than twenty years.  The appointments were\r\nmade in August and September when visits to Washington were not\r\nagreeable.  In a number of recommendations for a candidate, if he is\r\nnot entirely worthy, some of the letters of commendation will indicate\r\nweakness.  The whole ground will not be covered, or there will be\r\nqualifications.  A candidate so weakened should always be passed by.\r\nLetters are the safest basis of action in appointments to office.\r\nPersonal appeals are made most usually by interested parties.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the disasters to Pope and McClellan, Mr. Chase was\r\ndemoralized completely.  He said to me:\r\n\r\n\"We have only to wait for the end.\"\r\n\r\nHe took me to the President, and said that he could take no part in\r\nthe appointments.  In that period Mr. Chase was very bitter in his\r\ncriticisms of the President.  He thought him very slow in regard to\r\nemancipation.  Of this opinion there was a formidable knot around\r\nWashington, Mr. Chase and Mr. Sumner being at their head.  Indeed,\r\ntheir opinion in that particular was shared by many, myself among them,\r\nbut I never lost confidence in the purposes of Mr. Lincoln, and I well\r\nknew that the way of safety was to maintain the closest relations with\r\nhim.  No one who knew him had any ground to doubt his good intentions.\r\nThe truth was, that Mr. Chase was a candidate for the Presidency\r\nwhenever he had the courage to believe in the preservation of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nFrom July to the end of December, 1862, I went to the office before\r\nbreakfast, then during the day, and then again in the evening.  My only\r\nexercise was a ride on horseback after office hours and before dinner.\r\nWhen Pope's army was driven within the entrenchments of Washington,\r\nGeneral Banks was made military commander of the district.  I was then\r\nliving in a house at the corner of G and Twenty-first Streets, which my\r\nfriend Mr. Hooper tendered me during the recess of Congress upon the\r\ncondition that I would retain, pay and maintain his servants.  Among\r\nthem was his cook, Monaky, who had been cook for Mr. Webster.  When\r\nFletcher Webster was killed, she was in great grief.  I invited General\r\nBanks to make his quarters with me, and I had thus some means of\r\nknowing the condition of affairs in the army and around the district.\r\n\r\nWhile he was with me, we called upon General Hooker at the asylum, the\r\nInsane Hospital, on the east side of the east branch of the Potomac\r\nRiver, to which place he had been sent to be treated for a wound in his\r\nleg, which he had received at the Battle of Antietam.  He was violent\r\nin his denunciation of McClellan for not using his entire force, and\r\nfor not following the enemy--claiming that the whole body might have\r\nbeen destroyed.  Barring his violence of language, and the impropriety\r\nof criticising his commander, there can be no doubt of the justice of\r\nwhat he said.  McClellan retained upon the left bank of the Antietam,\r\na body of men whose participation in the battle at the opportune moment\r\nwould have changed a qualified victory into a rout of the enemy.  Lee\r\nwas saved at Antietam and at Gettysburg by the incompetency of\r\nMcClellan and Meade.\r\n\r\nThe movements by Lee in crossing the Potomac in 1862 and again in 1863\r\nwere most unfortunate for the Confederacy, and with Grant, or Sherman,\r\nor Sheridan, or Logan in command of our forces, must have resulted\r\ndisastrously.  It was the necessity of the situation that we were\r\ncompelled to go to Lee, wherever he might choose to place himself.\r\nWhen he assumed the offensive, and abandoned his base, he exchanged\r\npositions, and greatly to his disadvantage.  That he escaped\r\ndestruction was due to his good fortune and to our incompetency and\r\nnot to his own merit as commander.\r\n\r\nThe Sunday morning after Pope's defeat, David Dudley Field called at\r\nmy office at the Treasury, and after some conversation upon the\r\ncondition of affairs, he said he wished to see the President.  I aided\r\nhim in securing an interview.  What was the object of this interview\r\nwith the President I cannot say, but his conversation led my mind to\r\nthe conclusion that he thought himself qualified for the command of\r\nthe army.\r\n\r\nThe events of that day made a lasting impression upon my mind.  The\r\ncity was filled with troops, the hospitals, churches and other\r\nbuildings were crowded with the wounded; the streets were stuffed with\r\nambulances, baggage wagons, artillery, and material of war.  The hills\r\nwere dotted with tents, and the officers and men were discontented and\r\nalmost in a state of mutiny.  The demand for the restoration of\r\nMcClellan was almost universal.  There can be no doubt that he was then\r\nadored by the troops.  In six months that feeling had given place to a\r\nfeeling of indifference or positive distrust as to his capacity of\r\nintegrity of purpose.\r\n\r\nDuring the preceding week, I had made many attempts to secure an\r\ninterview with the President in regard to the appointment of collectors\r\nand assessors, as they were to commence their duties under the law\r\nSeptember 1.  Finally he gave me Sunday at 11 o'clock.  He canvassed\r\nthe papers and considered the merits of the candidates with as much\r\ncoolness and care apparently, as he would have exhibited in a condition\r\nof profound peace.  When the business was ended, he asked me what I\r\nthought about the command of the army.  I said unhesitatingly that the\r\nrestoration of McClellan seemed the only safe policy.  I had seen and\r\nheard so much, that I was apprehensive of serious trouble in the army\r\nif he should again be superseded.  I then said that emancipation\r\nseemed the only way out of our troubles.  He said in reply:\r\n\r\n\"Must we not wait for something that looks like a victory?  Would not\r\na proclamation now appear as _brutum fulmen?\"_--the only Latin I ever\r\nheard from the President.\r\n\r\nIn Gorham's Life of Stanton, it appears that the Cabinet advised\r\nagainst the restoration of McClellan, and that a vigorous protest was\r\nsigned by three members, which, however, was not presented.\r\n\r\nDuring the autumn and winter of 1862-3, I was in the habit of calling\r\nat the War Office for news, when I left the Treasury--usually between\r\nnine and eleven o'clock.  Not infrequently I met Mr. Lincoln on the\r\nway or at the department.  When the weather was cold he wore a gray\r\nshawl, muffled closely around his neck and shoulders.  There was great\r\nanxiety for General Grant in 1863, when he was engaged in the\r\nmovement across the Mississippi.  At that time I went to the War Office\r\ndaily.  One evening I met the President in front of the Executive\r\nMansion, on his way back from the War Department.  I said:\r\n\r\n\"Any news, Mr. President?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come in and I will tell you!\"\r\n\r\nI knew from the tones of his voice that he had good news.  He read the\r\ndispatch, and then by the maps followed the course that Grant had\r\ntaken.  The news he had received was from Grant himself.  From the 4th\r\nof March, 1861, I had not seen Mr. Lincoln as cheerful as he was when\r\nhe read the dispatch, and traced the campaign on the map.  He felt,\r\nevidently, that the end was approaching--although it was nearly two\r\nyears away.\r\n\r\nAs I had been elected to the House of Representatives in November,\r\n1862, I resigned my office of commissioner of internal revenue March\r\n3, 1863.  Mr. Chase was very unwilling to have me leave, and he\r\nendeavored to satisfy me that there was neither illegality nor\r\nimpropriety in my continuing until the meeting of Congress.  I did not\r\nagree to his view of the law, and moreover, Congress had so changed the\r\nlaw that the commissioner was required to give bonds.  In presence of\r\nthat requirement I should have left the place.  By the same act a\r\ncashier was authorized, and thus it happened that when the commissioner\r\nwas actually in receipt of the moneys the Government had no security\r\nand yet security was required when he was deprived of the power to\r\ntouch one cent of the receipts.  I remained at Washington from March 3\r\nto August, engaged in the preparation of a work upon the Revenue\r\nSystem.  This volume contains the rulings and decisions by me most of\r\nwhich have been sustained by the courts or justified by experience.*\r\n\r\nMy successor was Joseph J. Lewis, a country lawyer from Pennsylvania.\r\nHe had written a biography of Mr. Lincoln, and he had been the\r\nPresident's choice at the outset.  When I resigned, the President had\r\nhis way.  Whether Mr. Chase presented any other person I cannot say.\r\nMr. Lewis had no idea of the work of administration.  When questions\r\nwere submitted to the office, he proceeded to prepare an answer which\r\nhe wrote with a quill pen in his own hand.  At the beginning he sent\r\noff his answers without the knowledge of the chiefs of division, and in\r\nsome instances a newspaper report was the first information that the\r\nsubordinates obtained that a decision had been made.  In some instances\r\nhe passed upon old questions, without any inquiry or examination, until\r\nit was discovered that the head of a division was ruling one way and\r\nMr. Lewis was ruling another way at the same time.\r\n\r\nWhen I left the office in March, 1863, Mr. Chase said to me that it\r\nexceeded in magnitude the entire Treasury Department, March 1861.  It\r\nwas in fact the largest Government department ever organized in\r\nhistorical times, and it was organized without a precedent.  By its\r\nmachinery, it became finally so vast, that three hundred and fifty\r\nmillion dollars were assessed and collected in a single year.  In the\r\nthirty-eight years of its existence, the gross collections have\r\namounted to $5,524,363,255.89.  It has existed eight and thirty years\r\nwith no other changes than such as have been required by the change\r\nof laws.  The frame work, including the system of bookkeeping with its\r\nchecks and tests, remains.\r\n\r\nWhen I entered upon the work in July, I examined the records of the\r\nExcise Bureau established during the War of 1812, but they furnished\r\nno aid whatever in the execution of the work that was before me.  I had\r\nneither time nor opportunity to study the excise system of Great\r\nBritain; and hence the organization of the system of the United States\r\nwas based upon, and grew out of, the requirements of the law.  I do not\r\ndeem this a misfortune.  The public anxiety in regard to the\r\nconstruction of the law induced a large amount of correspondence with\r\npersons in various parts of the country, and in the month of October\r\nthe letters sent numbered occasionally eight hundred per day.  Many of\r\nthese letters were formal, and others were repetitions of those\r\npreviously given; but each day compelled attention to a large number\r\nof new questions.\r\n\r\nThe practice of our office in the construction of the law was\r\ncontrolled by a few leading principles.\r\n\r\nFirst:  to levy a tax in those cases only which were clearly provided\r\nfor by the statute and, consequently, whenever a reasonable doubt\r\nexisted, the decision was against the Government and in favor of the\r\ncontestant.\r\n\r\nSecond:  In deciding whether an article was or was not a manufacture,\r\nit was the practice to ascertain how it was regarded by business men at\r\nthe time the excise law was passed; in all cases abstaining from\r\ninquiry as to the mode of preparation, or the nature or extent of the\r\nchange produced.  If the article in question was regarded by the makers\r\nand by business men as an article of commerce, and it was produced by\r\nhand or machinery, it was the practice to treat it as a manufacture\r\nunder the law, unless specially exempt.\r\n\r\nThird:  Upon articles manufactured and removed for consumption by the\r\nmanufacturer, the tax was assessed precisely as it would have been\r\nassessed if the articles had been removed for sale.\r\n\r\nFourth:  In considering the law relating to the use of stamps, it was\r\nthe rule of the office to give that signification to the name used in\r\nthe statute descriptive of various instruments subject to stamp tax,\r\nwhich was ordinarily given to such descriptive terms by business and\r\nprofessional men.  In the year 1901 it may be assumed that the\r\nInternal Revenue Office will exist while the Government shall exist,\r\nalthough it came into being as a war measure and as a temporary policy.\r\n\r\n[* In the early sixties I was associated in the profession with a man\r\neight years my junior, John Quincy Adams Griffin.  He was a man of\r\ninfinite jest, but lacking in fancy.  His letters and other writings\r\nwould make a volume of no mean quality.  His death came too early for\r\nan extended and lasting reputation.  In his sallies he did not spare\r\nhis friends, and he wounded his opponents.  On one occasion as we were\r\nupon the street I was induced to buy a paper by a boy's cry \"Great\r\nbattle!\"  When I opened the paper the sheet was a blank.  I said:\r\n\r\n\"What do you suppose will become of that wretch?\"\r\n\r\nAlluding to the fact that I was about forty years of age when I was\r\nadmitted to the bar, Griffin said:\r\n\r\n\"I think he will study law and enter the profession rather late in\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\nHis last letter to me was as solemn as death itself, but he could not\r\nomit an instance of his habit:\r\n\r\n\"The doctors tell me that I have water around my heart, but I know it\r\nisn't so, for I have drank nothing but beer for six months.\"\r\n\r\nThis paragraph was commenced for the purpose of citing another instance\r\nof his quality.  In our office was a volume of my treatise on the\r\nExcise and Internal Revenue Laws of the United States.  Many years\r\nafter Griffin's death I found this entry on the fly-leaf of the volume:\r\n\r\n\"DEDICATION\r\n\"To the memory of Caesar Augustus in whose reign there went forth the\r\ndecree that all the world should be taxed, this book is respectfully\r\ndedicated by the AUTHOR.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL.
