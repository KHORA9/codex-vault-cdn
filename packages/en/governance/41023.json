WILL CROOKS\r\n\r\nTHIS SLIGHT RECORD OF HER HUSBAND'S CAREER\r\n\r\nIS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThis record of the career of a man whom I have known intimately in his\r\npublic and private life for over a dozen years can claim at least one\r\ndistinction. It is the first biography of a working man who has\r\ndeliberately chosen to remain in the ranks of working men as well as in\r\ntheir service. From the day in the early 'nineties when he was called\r\nupon to decide between a prospective partnership in a prosperous\r\nbusiness and the hard, joyless life of a Labour representative, with\r\npoverty for his lot and slander for his reward, he has adhered to the\r\nprinciple he then laid down, consistently refusing ever since the many\r\ninvitations received from various quarters to come up higher. There have\r\nbeen endless biographies of men who have risen from the ranks of Labour\r\nand then deserted those ranks for wealthy circles. Will Crooks, in his\r\nown words, has not risen from the ranks; he is still in the ranks,\r\nstanding four-square with the working classes against monopoly and\r\nprivilege.\r\n\r\nThis book would have been an autobiography rather than a biography could\r\nI have had my way. Nor was I alone in urging Crooks to write the story\r\nof his life, as strenuous in its poverty as it has been in its public\r\nservice. He always argued that that was not in his way at all--that, in\r\nfact, he did not believe in men sitting down to write about themselves\r\nany more than he believed in men getting up to talk about themselves.\r\n\r\nSo I have done the next best thing. Since the interpretation depends\r\nupon the interpreter, I have tried, in writing this account of his life,\r\nto make him the narrator as often as I could. Most of the incidents in\r\nhis career I have given in his own words, mainly from personal talks we\r\nhave had together during our years of friendship, sometimes by our own\r\nfiresides, sometimes amid the stress of public life, sometimes during\r\nlong walks in the streets of London. Nor do any of the incidents lose in\r\ndetail or in verity by reason of many of those cherished conversations\r\nhaving taken place long before either of us ever dreamed they would\r\nafterwards be pieced together in book form.\r\n\r\nNot to Crooks alone am I indebted for help in compiling this book. I owe\r\nmuch to members of his family, to my wife, and to other friends of his.\r\n\r\nGEORGE HAW.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n                                                    PAGE\r\nINTRODUCTION                                        xiii\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nEARLIEST YEARS IN A ONE-ROOMED HOME                    1\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nAS A CHILD IN THE WORKHOUSE                            8\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nSCHOOLS AND SCHOOLMASTERS                             16\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nROUND THE HAUNTS OF HIS BOYHOOD                       25\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nIN TRAINING FOR A CRAFTSMAN                           33\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nTRAMPING THE COUNTRY FOR WORK                         43\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nONE OF LONDON'S UNEMPLOYED                            50\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nTHE COLLEGE AT THE DOCK GATES                         57\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nFROM THE CHEERING MULTITUDE TO A SORROW-LADEN HOME    67\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nA LABOUR MEMBER'S WAGES                               75\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nON THE LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL                          85\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\nTWO OF HIS MONUMENTS                                  96\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\nTHE TASK OF HIS LIFE BEGINS                          105\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\nTHE MAN WHO FED THE POOR                             112\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\nTURNING WORKHOUSE CHILDREN INTO USEFUL CITIZENS      119\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\nON THE METROPOLITAN ASYLUMS BOARD                    128\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\nA BAD BOYS' ADVOCATE                                 134\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\nPROUD OF THE POOR                                    144\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\nTHE FIRST WORKING-MAN MAYOR IN LONDON                154\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\nTHE KING'S DINNER--AND OTHERS                        166\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\nTHE MAN WHO PAID OLD-AGE PENSIONS                    175\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\nELECTION TO PARLIAMENT                               186\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\nADVENT OF THE POLITICAL LABOUR PARTY                 195\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\nTHE LIVING WAGE FOR MEN AND WOMEN                    202\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\nFREE TRADE IN THE NAME OF THE POOR                   210\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\nPREPARING FOR THE UNEMPLOYED ACT                     219\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\nAGITATION IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS                    227\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\nTHE QUEEN INTERVENES                                 241\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\nHOME LIFE AND SOME ENGAGEMENTS                       252\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\nCOLONISING ENGLAND                                   264\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\nTHE REVIVAL OF BUMBLEDOM                             271\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\nAPPEAL TO THE PEOPLE                                 280\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\"THE HAPPY WARRIOR\"                                  296\r\n\r\nINDEX                                                303\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLIST OF PLATES\r\n\r\n\r\nWILL CROOKS, M.P.                      _Frontispiece_\r\n\r\nTHE CROOKS FAMILY                      _Facing p._ 18\r\n\r\nWILL CROOKS ADDRESSING AN OPEN-AIR\r\nMEETING AT WOOLWICH                        \"      192\r\n\r\nMR. AND MRS. WILL CROOKS                   \"      248\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Will Crooks, as I know him in his own house at Poplar and in that\r\nother House at Westminster, always seems to me to be something far\r\ngreater than a Labour Member of Parliament. He stands out as the supreme\r\ntype of the English working classes, who have chosen him as one of their\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\nRepresentative government, a mystical institution, is said to have\r\noriginated in some of the monastic orders. In any case, it is evident\r\nthat the character of it is symbolic, and that it is subject to all the\r\nadvantages and all the disadvantages of a symbol. Just exactly as a\r\nreligious ritual may for a time represent a real emotion, and then for a\r\ntime cease to represent anything, so representative government may for a\r\ntime represent the people, and for a time cease to represent anything.\r\nBut the peculiar difficulties attaching to the thing called\r\nrepresentative government have not been fully appreciated. The great\r\ndifficulty of representative governments is simply this: that the\r\nrepresentative is supposed to discharge two quite definite and distinct\r\nfunctions. There is in his position the idea of being a picture or copy\r\nof the thing he represents. There is also the idea of being an\r\ninstrument of the thing he represents, or a message from the thing he\r\nrepresents. The first is like the shadow a man throws on the wall; the\r\nsecond is like the stone that he throws over the wall. In the first\r\nsense, it is supposed that the representative is like the thing he\r\nrepresents. In the second case it is only supposed that the\r\nrepresentative is useful to the thing he represents. In the first case,\r\na parliamentary representative is used strictly as a parliamentary\r\nrepresentative. In the second case a parliamentary representative is\r\nused as a weapon. He is used as a missile. He is used as something to be\r\nmerely thrown against the enemy; and those who merely throw something\r\nagainst the enemy do not ask especially that the thing they throw shall\r\nbe a particular copy of themselves. To send one's challenge is not to\r\nsend one's photograph. When Ajax hurled a stone at his enemy, it was not\r\na stone carved in the image of Ajax. When a modern general causes a\r\ncannon-ball to be fired, he is not understood to indicate that the\r\ncontours of the cannon-ball represent in any exact way the curves of his\r\nown person. In short, we can in modern representative politics use a\r\npolitician as a missile without using him, in the fullest sense of the\r\nword, as a symbol.\r\n\r\nIn this sense most of our representatives in modern representative\r\ngovernment are merely used as missiles. Mr. Balfour is a missile. Mr.\r\nBalfour is hurled at the heads of his enemies like a boomerang or a\r\njavelin. He is flung by the great mass of mediocre Tory squires. He is\r\nflung, not because he is at all like them, for that he obviously is not.\r\nHe is flung because he is a particularly bright and sharp missile; that\r\nis to say, because he is so very unlike the men who fling him. Here,\r\nthen, is the primary paradox of representative government. Men elect a\r\nrepresentative half because he is like themselves and half because he is\r\nnot like themselves. They elect a representative half because he\r\nrepresents them and half because he misrepresents them. They choose Mr.\r\nBalfour (let us say) half because he does what they would do and half\r\nbecause he does what they could never do at all.\r\n\r\nWe are told that the Labour movement will be an exception to all\r\nprevious rules. The Labour movement has been no exception to this\r\nprevious rule. The Labour Members, as a class, are not representatives,\r\nbut missiles. Poor men elect them, not because they are like poor men,\r\nbut because they are likely to damage rich men: an excellent reason.\r\nLabour Members are the exceptions among Labour men. As I have said, they\r\nare weapons, missiles, things thrown. Working-men are not at all like\r\nMr. Keir Hardie. If it comes to likeness, working-men are rather more\r\nlike the Duke of Devonshire. But they throw Mr. Keir Hardie at the Duke\r\nof Devonshire, knowing that he is so curiously shaped as to hurt\r\nanything at which he is thrown. Unless this is thoroughly understood,\r\ngreat injustice will necessarily be done to the Labour movement; for it\r\nis obvious on the face of it that Labour Members do not represent the\r\naverage of labouring men. A man like Mr. J. R. Macdonald no more\r\nsuggests a Battersea workman than he suggests a Bedouin or a Russian\r\nGrand Duke. These men are not the representatives of the democracy, but\r\nthe weapons of the democracy. They are intended only to fulfil the\r\nsecond of those functions in the delegate which I have already defined.\r\nThey are the instruments of the people. They are not the images of the\r\npeople. They are fanatics for the things about which the people are\r\ngood-humouredly convinced. They are philosophers about the things which\r\nare to the people an easy and commonplace religion. In a word, they are\r\nnot representatives; they are not even ambassadors. They are\r\ndeclarations of war.\r\n\r\nSuch being the problem, we must reconcile ourselves to finding many of\r\nthe Labour Members men of a definite and even pedantic class; men whose\r\naustere and lucid tone, whose elaborate economic explanations smack of\r\nsomething very different from the actual streets of London. This\r\neconomic knowledge may be very necessary. It may remind us of our\r\nduties; but it does not remind us of the Walworth Road. It may enable a\r\nman to speak for the proletarians, but it does not enable a man to speak\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nNow, if a man has a good rough-and-ready knowledge of the mechanics of\r\nBattersea and the labourers of Poplar; if the same man has a good\r\nrough-and-ready knowledge of the men in the House of Commons (a vastly\r\ninferior company); he will come out of both those experiences with one\r\nquite square and solid conviction, a conviction the grounds of which,\r\nthough they may be difficult to define verbally, are as unshakable as\r\nthe ground. He will come out with the conviction that there is really\r\nonly one modern Labour Member who represents, who symbolises, or who\r\neven remotely suggests the real labouring men of London; and that is Mr.\r\nWill Crooks.\r\n\r\nMr. Crooks alone fulfils both the functions of the representative. He is\r\na representative who, like Mr. Keir Hardie and the others, fights,\r\ncleaves a way, does something that only a man of talent could do,\r\nexpresses the inexpressible, sacrifices himself. But also, unlike Mr.\r\nKeir Hardie, and the rest, he is a representative who represents. He is\r\na picture as well as a projectile; he is the stone carved in the image\r\nof Ajax. He is really like the people for whom he stands. A man can\r\nrealise this fact, merely as a fact, without implying any disrespect,\r\nfor instance, to the Scotch ideality of Mr. Keir Hardie, or the Scotch\r\nstrenuousness of Mr. John Burns. They are expressive of the English\r\ndemocracy, but not typical of it. The first characteristic of Mr.\r\nCrooks, which must strike anyone who has ever had to do with him, even\r\nfor ten minutes, is this immense fact of the absolute and isolated\r\ngenuineness of his connection with the working classes. To all the other\r\nLabour leaders we listen with respect on Labour matters, because they\r\nhave been elected by labourers. To him alone we should listen if he had\r\nnever been elected at all. Of him alone it can be said that if we did\r\nnot accept him as a representative, we should still accept him as a\r\ntype. I need not dwell, and indeed I feel no desire to dwell, on those\r\nqualities in Mr. Crooks which express just now the popular qualities of\r\nthe populace. I feel more interest in the unpopular qualities of the\r\npopulace.\r\n\r\nThe greatness of Mr. Crooks lies not in the fact that he expresses the\r\nclaims of the populace, which twenty dons at Oxford would be ready to\r\nexpress; it is that he expresses the populace: its strong tragedy and\r\nits strong farce. He is not a demagogue. He is not even a democrat. He\r\nis a demos; he is the real King. And his chief characteristic, as I have\r\nsuggested, is that he represents especially those popular good\r\nqualities which are unpopular in modern discussion. Will Crooks is to\r\nthe ordinary London omnibus conductor or cabman exactly what Robert\r\nBurns was to the ordinary puritanical but passionate peasant of the\r\nScotch Lowlands. He is the journeyman of genius. All that is good in\r\nthem is better in him; but it is the same thing. Walt Whitman has\r\nperfectly expressed this attitude of the average towards the fine type.\r\n\"They see themselves in him. They hardly know themselves, they are so\r\ngrown.\"\r\n\r\nIn numberless points Mr. Crooks thus completes and glorifies the common\r\ncharacter of the poor man. Take, for instance, the deep matter of\r\nhumour: humour in which the English poor are certainly pre-eminent among\r\nall classes of the nation and all nations of the world. By all\r\npoliticians, including Labour politicians, humour is only introduced\r\nexceptionally and elaborately; by all politicians the comic anecdote is\r\nled up to with dextrous prefaces and deep intonations, as if it were\r\nsomething altogether unique and separate. All politicians take their own\r\nhumour very seriously. Mr. Crooks recalls the real life of the streets\r\nin nothing so much as in the fact that humour is a constant condition.\r\nHe and the poor exist in a normal atmosphere of amiable irony. If\r\nanything, they have to make an effort to become verbally serious:\r\nsomething of the same kind of earnest that it costs an ordinary member\r\nof Parliament to become witty. Anyone who has heard Mr. Crooks talk\r\nknows that his permanent mood is humorous. He is never without a story,\r\nbut his face and his mind are humorous before he has even thought of the\r\nstory. He lives, so to speak, in a state of expectant reminiscence. The\r\nman who said that \"brevity was the soul of wit\" told a lie; nobody\r\nminds how long wit goes on so long as it is wit. Mr. Crooks belongs to\r\nthat strong old school of English humour in which Dickens was supreme;\r\nthat school which some moderns have called dull because it could go on\r\nfor a long time being interesting.\r\n\r\nI have merely taken this case of popular humour as one out of a hundred.\r\nA similar case of Mr. Crooks's popular sympathy might be found in his\r\npathos, which is equally uncompromising and direct. Even his political\r\nfaults, if they are faults, against which so much criticism has for a\r\ntime been raised, have still this pervading quality, that they are\r\nessentially the popular faults. This instinct for a prompt and practical\r\nand hand-to-mouth benevolence, this instinct for giving a very good time\r\nto those who have had a very bad time, this is the very soul of that\r\nimmense and astonishing altruism at which all social reformers have\r\nstood thunderstruck: the kindness of the poor to the poor. This attitude\r\nmay or may not be the great vice of the governors; there is no doubt\r\nthat it is the great virtue of the people. The charity of poor men to\r\npoor men has always been spontaneous, irregular, individual, liable\r\ntherefore in its nature to some faults of confusion or of favouritism.\r\n\r\nIt is the misfortune of Mr. Crooks that alone among modern\r\nphilanthropists and social reformers he has really been the typical poor\r\nman giving to poor men. This quality which has been seen and condemned\r\nin him is simply the quality which is the common and working morality of\r\nthe London streets. You may like it; you may dislike it. But if you\r\ndislike it you are simply disliking the English people. You have seen\r\nEnglish people perhaps for a moment in omnibuses, in streets on Saturday\r\nnights, in third-class carriages, or even in Bank Holiday waggonettes.\r\nYou have not yet seen the English people in politics. It has not yet\r\nentered politics. Liberals do not represent it; Tories do not represent\r\nit; Labour Members, on the whole, represent it rather less than Tories\r\nor Liberals. When it enters politics it will bring with it a trail of\r\nall the things that politicians detest; prejudices (as against\r\nhospitals), superstitions (as about funerals), a thirst for\r\nrespectability passing that of the middle classes, a faith in the family\r\nwhich will knock to pieces half the Socialism of Europe. If ever that\r\npeople enters politics it will sweep away most of our revolutionists as\r\nmere pedants. It will be able to point only to one figure, powerful,\r\npathetic, humorous, and very humble, who bore in any way upon his face\r\nthe sign and star of its authority.\r\n\r\nG. K. CHESTERTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM WORKHOUSE TO WESTMINSTER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nEARLIEST YEARS IN A ONE-ROOMED HOME\r\n\r\n     Difference between \"Will\" and \"William\"--Early Memories--Crying for\r\n     Bread--An Aspersion Resented--A Prophecy that has been\r\n     Fulfilled--Will earns his First Half-Sovereign.\r\n\r\n\r\nWill Crooks!\r\n\r\nIn the little one-roomed home where he was born at No. 2, Shirbutt\r\nStreet, down by the Docks at Poplar, it was the earnest desire of all\r\nwhom it concerned that he should be known to the world as William\r\nCrooks. The desire found practical expression in the register of Trinity\r\nCongregational Church in East India Dock Road close by. Thither, within\r\na few weeks of his birth, in the year 1852, he was carried with modest\r\nceremony and solemnly christened by a name which everybody ever since\r\nhas refused to give to him.\r\n\r\nFor somehow \"William Crooks\" does not sound like the man at all. Looking\r\nat it gives you no suggestion of the good-humoured, hard-headed Labour\r\nman, known as familiarly to his colleagues in the House of Commons as\r\nhe is to the great world of wage-earners outside by the shorter and more\r\nexpressive name of Will Crooks.\r\n\r\nBorn in poverty, the third of seven children, Will Crooks, who is\r\nblessed with keen powers of observation and a good memory, can carry his\r\nmind back to the days before he was put into breeches.\r\n\r\n\"I remember before my fourth year was out,\" I have heard him tell,\r\n\"something of the public rejoicings on the declaration of peace after\r\nthe Crimean War. The following year was also memorable to me as the time\r\nI witnessed troops of soldiers marching to the East India Docks on the\r\noutbreak of the Mutiny.\"\r\n\r\nThose were days of want and sorrow, as were many days that followed, in\r\nthe little one-roomed home in East London. His father was a ship's\r\nstoker, who lost an arm by the starting of the engines one day when he\r\nwas oiling the machinery as his vessel lay in the Thames.\r\n\r\n\"My very earliest recollections are associated with mother dressing\r\nfather's arm day after day. I was only three years old at the time, but\r\nI know that all our privations dated from the day of this accident to my\r\nfather, because he was forced to give up his work.\r\n\r\n\"It must have been with the aid of some good friends that at last my\r\nfather got an old horse, hoping to earn a little by leading and carting;\r\nbut nothing came of this small venture, and in time the horse had to be\r\nsold to pay the rent. Almost the only work of any kind that father,\r\nbeing thus disabled, could get to do was an odd job as watchman.\r\n\r\n\"Those were very lean years indeed, and I don't know what we should have\r\ndone but for mother. She used to toil with the needle far into the night\r\nand often all night long, slaving as hard as any poor sweated woman I\r\nhave ever known, and I have known hundreds of such poor creatures. Many\r\na time as a lad have I helped mother to carry the clothes she had made\r\nto Houndsditch. There were no trams running then, and the 'bus fare from\r\nPoplar to Aldgate was fourpence, a sum we never dared think of spending\r\non a ride.\r\n\r\n\"My elder brother was as clever with the needle as many a woman, and\r\noften he would stay up all through the night with mother, helping her to\r\nmake oil-skin coats.\"\r\n\r\nOne night, as the mother worked alone, young Will woke up in the little\r\norange-box bedstead by the wall where he slept with a younger brother.\r\nSilently he watched her plying the needle at the table until he noticed\r\ntears trickling down her cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"What are you crying for, mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, Will, my boy. You go to sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you must be crying about something, mother.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then, in a doleful tone, she said, \"It's through wondering where the\r\nnext meal is coming from, my boy.\"\r\n\r\nThe little chap pretended to go to sleep soon after; but now and again\r\nhe would peep cautiously over the side of the box at his mother silently\r\ncrying over her work at the table. And he puzzled his young head as to\r\nwhat it all meant.\r\n\r\n\"My mother crying because she can't get bread for us! Why can't she get\r\nbread? I saw plenty of bread in the shops yesterday. Do all mothers have\r\nto cry before they can get bread for their children?\"\r\n\r\nIt was the first incident that made him think.\r\n\r\nThere was one morning, the morning after a Christmas Day of all times in\r\nthe year, when his mother refused to let him or the others get up, even\r\nwhen she left the house. It was not until she returned after what seemed\r\na long time, bringing with her a portion of a loaf, that she allowed\r\nthem to get out of bed.\r\n\r\n\"It was many years afterwards before I learnt the reason for her strange\r\nconduct that Boxing Day morning. Then I found out that she had made a\r\nvow that her children should never get up unless there was some\r\nbreakfast for them.\r\n\r\n\"We were so poor that we children never got a drop of tea for months\r\ntogether. It used to be bread and treacle for breakfast, bread and\r\ntreacle for dinner, bread and treacle for tea, washed down with a cup of\r\ncold water. Sometimes there was a little variation in the form of\r\ndripping. At other times the variety was secured by there being neither\r\ntreacle nor dripping. The very bread was so scarce that mother could not\r\nafford to allow the three eldest, of whom I was one, more than three\r\nslices apiece at a meal, while the four youngest got two and a half\r\nslices. Whenever we could afford to buy tea or butter, it was only in\r\nounces. Once my brother and I were sent to buy a whole quarter of a\r\npound of butter--it turned out that auntie was coming to tea--and on the\r\nway we speculated seriously whether mother was going to open a shop.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps the first occasion upon which Crooks as a lad showed something\r\nof that spirited resentment at aspersions on the poor which ultimately\r\nled him into public life was one that arose in a cobbler's shop. He was\r\nabout eight years old, when his father sent him back with a pair of\r\nboots that had been repaired to ask that a little more be done to them\r\nfor the money.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what he wants for his ninepence,\" said the cobbler,\r\nreferring to the lad's father; \"but, there!\"--throwing the boots to his\r\nman--\"put another patch on. He's only a poor beggar.\"\r\n\r\nThere was an angry cry from the other side, of the counter. \"My father's\r\nnot a poor beggar!\" shouted the boy. \"He's as good a man as you, and\r\nonly wants what he has paid for.\"\r\n\r\nIf the boy thought much of the father the father thought much of the\r\nboy. It had often been his boast that \"Our Will will do things some\r\nday.\"\r\n\r\nOne little fancy of the old man's was brought to my notice the morning\r\nafter Crooks was first returned to Parliament for Woolwich. His elder\r\nbrother told me then of a little incident that took place over\r\nforty-five years before.\r\n\r\n\"We children were playing in the home together when young Will said\r\nsomething which made the dad look up surprised. And I heard him say to\r\nmother, 'That lad'll live to be either Lord Mayor of London or a Member\r\nof Parliament.'\"\r\n\r\nThe poverty deepened and darkened in the little one-roomed home during\r\nWill's boyhood. It soon became impossible even to spend an odd ninepence\r\non boot repairs. The mother met this emergency as she met nearly all the\r\nothers. She became the family cobbler, as she had all along been the\r\nfamily tailor. Often would she go on her knees, hammer in hand, mending\r\nthe boots. The children could not remember the time when she did not\r\nmake all their clothes.\r\n\r\n\"God only knows, God only will know, how my mother worked and wept,\"\r\nsays Crooks. \"With it all she brought up seven of us to be decent and\r\nuseful men and women. She was everything to us. I owe to her what little\r\nschooling I got, for, though she could neither read nor write herself,\r\nshe would often remark that that should never be said of any of her\r\nchildren. I owe to her wise training that I have been a teetotaller all\r\nmy life. I owe it to her that I was saved from becoming a little wastrel\r\nof the streets, for, as a Christian woman, she kept me at the Sunday\r\nSchool and took me regularly to the Congregational Church where I had\r\nbeen baptised.\r\n\r\n\"I can picture her now as I used to see her when I awoke in the night\r\nmaking oil-skin coats by candle-light in our single room. Youngster\r\nthough I was, I meant it from the very bottom of my heart when I used to\r\nwhisper to myself, as I peeped at her from the little box-bedstead by\r\nthe wall, 'Wait till I'm a man! Won't I work for my mother when I'm a\r\nman!'\"\r\n\r\nHe thought he was a man at thirteen, when he could bring home to her\r\nproudly five shillings every week, his wages in the blacksmith's shop.\r\nThere came a memorable Saturday night when, having worked overtime all\r\nthe week and earned an extra five shillings, he was paid his first\r\nhalf-sovereign. He threw on his coat and cap excitedly and ran all the\r\nway home from Limehouse Causeway, the half-sovereign clenched tightly in\r\nhis hand, until he burst breathlessly into the little room, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n\"Mother, mother, I've earned half a sovereign, all of it myself, and\r\nit's yours, all yours, every bit yours!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nAS A CHILD IN THE WORKHOUSE\r\n\r\n     With an Idiot Boy in the Workhouse--Life in the Poor Law School at\r\n     Sutton--At Home Once More--A Fashionable Knock for the Casual\r\n     Ward--A Bread Riot.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut we must go back a few years--to the evil day when, the father being\r\na cripple, the family have to enter the workhouse.\r\n\r\nThe mother had before this been forced to ask for parish relief. For a\r\ntime the Guardians paid her two or three shillings a week and gave her a\r\nlittle bread. Suddenly these scanty supplies were stopped. The mother\r\nwas told to come before the Board and bring her children.\r\n\r\nSix of them, clinging timidly to her skirt, were taken into the terrible\r\npresence. The Chairman singled out Will, then eight years of age, and,\r\npointing his finger at him, remarked solemnly:\r\n\r\n\"It's time that boy was getting his own living.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is at work, sir,\" was the mother's timid apology. \"He gets up at a\r\nquarter to five every morning and goes round with the milkman for\r\nsixpence a week.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't he earn more than that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, the milkman says he's a very willing boy and always\r\npunctual, but he's so little that he doesn't think he can pay him more\r\nthan sixpence yet.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the little boy looked furtively at the great man in the great chair,\r\nnever dreaming that the time would come when he would occupy that chair\r\nhimself, and that almost the first order he would issue from it would be\r\none putting an end to the bad practice of making mothers drag their\r\nyoung children before the Board.\r\n\r\nOn that unhappy afternoon the Guardians, firm in their resolve not to\r\nrenew the out-relief, offered to take the children into the workhouse.\r\nThe mother said 'No' at first, marching them all bravely home again.\r\nStern want forced her to yield at last. The day came when she saw the\r\nfive youngest, including Will, taken from home to the big poorhouse down\r\nby the Millwall Docks. The crippled father was admitted into the House\r\nat the same time.\r\n\r\nThey were put into a bare room like a vault, the father and two sons,\r\nwhile the three sisters were taken they knew not where. There the lads\r\nand their dad spent the night and the next day until the doctor saw them\r\nand passed them into the main workhouse building. Then Will lost sight\r\nof his father, though he was permitted to remain with his young brother\r\nand share with him the same bed.\r\n\r\nIn the dormitory was an idiot boy, who used to ramble in his talk all\r\nthrough the night, keeping the others awake. Sometimes Will succeeded in\r\ncoaxing his young brother off to sleep, but as for himself, he would\r\nlie awake for hours listening to the strange talk of the idiot boy, and\r\nthinking of his mother. Often in the night the idiot boy would cry out\r\nfor his own mother, leaving Will wondering who she was and where she\r\nwas, and whether the plaintive cry of her imbecile child ever reached\r\nher ears in the night's stillness.\r\n\r\nThe lad was ravenously hungry all the time he spent in the workhouse. He\r\noften felt at times as though he could eat leather; yet every morning,\r\nwhen the \"skilly\" was served for breakfast, he could not touch it.\r\nMorning after morning, spurred on by hunger, he forced the spoon into\r\nhis mouth, but the stomach revolted, and he always felt as though the\r\nfirst spoonful would turn him sick.\r\n\r\nSomehow his father, away in the men's ward, got to know that young Will,\r\nwho he knew could relish dry crusts at home with the best of them, was\r\nnot able to eat the fare provided in the workhouse. The men occasionally\r\ngot suet pudding, and one dinner-time the old man secretly smuggled his\r\nportion into his pocket. In the afternoon he made over to the children's\r\nquarters, hoping to hand it to Will. The pudding was produced, the lad's\r\nhungry eyes lighted up, when, behold! it was snatched away, almost from\r\nhis very grasp. The burly figure of the labour master interposed between\r\nfather and son. This was a breach of discipline not to be tolerated in\r\nthe workhouse.\r\n\r\n\"But the boy's hungry, and this is what I've saved from my own dinner,\"\r\nargued the father (all in vain). \"You don't know how that boy likes\r\nsuet pudding.\"\r\n\r\nFor two or three weeks the Crooks children were kept in the workhouse,\r\nbefore being taken away in an omnibus with other boys and girls to the\r\nPoor Law School at Sutton. Then came the most agonising experience of\r\nall to Will. They parted him from his young brother. In the great hall\r\nof the school he would strain his eyes, hoping to get a glimpse of the\r\nlone little fellow among the other lads, but he never set eyes on him\r\nagain until the afternoon they went home together.\r\n\r\n\"Every day I spent in that school is burnt into my soul,\" he has often\r\ndeclared since.\r\n\r\nHe could not sleep at night nor play with the other boys, haunted as he\r\nwas by the strange dread that he must have committed some unknown crime\r\nto be taken from home, torn from his young brother, and made a little\r\ncaptive in what seemed a fearful prison. The nights seemed endless, and\r\nwere always awful. He whispered his fears on the fourth day to another\r\nPoplar boy who was there.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! you just wait until Sunday,\" said the other lad. \"Every Sunday's\r\nlike a fortnight.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Sunday did come it proved to be one lasting agony. He thought time\r\ncould not be made more terrible to children anywhere. They had dinner at\r\ntwelve and tea at six, confined during the yawning interval in the dull\r\nday-room with nothing to do but to look at the clock, and then out of\r\nthe window, and then back at the clock again.\r\n\r\nDuring the week, after school hours, he hung about in abject misery all\r\nthe time. From the day he went in to the day he left he never smiled.\r\nOne afternoon he was loitering in the playground as the matron showed\r\nsome visitors round.\r\n\r\n\"Who is that sad-faced boy?\" he heard one of them ask.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he's one of the new-comers,\" the matron answered. \"He'll soon get\r\nover it.\"\r\n\r\nThe new-comer said to himself, \"I wonder whether you would soon get over\r\nit if you had been taken from your mother and parted from a young\r\nbrother?\"\r\n\r\nHow long he stayed in the workhouse school he has never been able to\r\ntell. It could not have been very long in point of time, but to the\r\nsensitive lad it seemed an age. An indescribable burden was lifted from\r\nhis shoulders when one day at dinner someone called him by his name.\r\n\r\nHe sprang to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Go to the tailor's shop after dinner and get your own clothes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What for, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are going home!\"\r\n\r\nHis heart leapt up. The boys crowded round him, wishing they were in his\r\nplace. Poor miserable lads, he parted from them with feelings of the\r\ndeepest pity.\r\n\r\nAt the gate he met his young brother and sisters again, and they were\r\ntaken back to Poplar, to be welcomed with open arms by their mother. She\r\nhad worked harder than ever to add to the family income in order to\r\njustify her in going before the Guardians to ask that her children be\r\nrestored to her own keeping.\r\n\r\nNot until thirty-three years later could he command the courage to enter\r\nthat same workhouse school again. Many changes for the good had been\r\nmade, but the sight of the same hall, with the same peculiar odour,\r\nbrought back the same old feeling of utter friendlessness and despair.\r\nAnd he saw in imagination a sad-faced boy sitting on the form, straining\r\nhis eyes in the vain search for his young brother.\r\n\r\nThe mother had moved to a cheaper room when the children returned home\r\nfrom the workhouse school. It was in a small house in the High Street,\r\nnext door to the entrance to the casual ward, with the main workhouse\r\nbuilding in the rear. This was Will's home for the rest of his boyhood.\r\n\r\nThere, with the workhouse surrounding him as it were, he got daily\r\nglimpses of the misery that hovers round the Poor Law. Men and women\r\nwould sit for hours huddled on the pavement in front of his home waiting\r\nfor the casual ward to open. Will came bounding out of the house in the\r\ndull dawn to go to work as an errand boy one morning, when he kicked\r\nviolently against a bundle of rags on the pavement.\r\n\r\nThere was a cry of pain in a woman's voice, and the lad pulled up sharp,\r\nfilled with remorse:\r\n\r\n\"I'm _so_ sorry, missus; I am really. I didn't see you.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, kiddie. I saw you couldn't help it. I'm used to being\r\nkicked about the streets.\"\r\n\r\nBut the lad could not forget it. And when he came home at dinner-time,\r\n\"Oh, mother,\" he said, \"I kicked a poor woman outside our door this\r\nmorning, and I wouldn't have done it for anything, had I known.\"\r\n\r\nSometimes a poor wayfarer would knock at the door, mistaking it for the\r\nentrance to the casual ward. In answer to a series of sharp raps one\r\nnight Will raced to the door with the mother of another family who\r\nrented the front room. She got there first and opened it, to find a\r\ntramp on the step.\r\n\r\n\"Is this the casual ward?\"\r\n\r\n\"The casual ward!\" cried the woman in disgust, turning away and leaving\r\nWill to direct him. \"That's a nice fashionable kind of knock to come\r\nwith asking for the casual ward!\"\r\n\r\nIt was from this house that he saw a bread riot in the winter of 1866,\r\nwhen he got the first of many impressions he was to receive of what a\r\nwinter of bad trade means to a district of casual labour like Poplar.\r\nHundreds of men used to wait outside the workhouse gates for a 2-lb.\r\nloaf each. The baker's waggon drove up with the bread one afternoon\r\nwhile they waited. The ravenous crowd would not let it pass into the\r\nworkhouse yard. They seized the bread, frantically struggling with each\r\nother. Almost as fiercely they tore the bread to pieces when they got it\r\nand devoured it on the spot.\r\n\r\nSights like these of his childhood, with the shuddering memories of his\r\nown dark days in the workhouse and the workhouse school, made him\r\nregister a vow, little chap though he was at the time, that when he grew\r\nup to be a man he would do all he could to make better and brighter the\r\nlot of the inmates, especially that of the boys and girls.\r\n\r\nSome children's dreams come true, and this was one of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nSCHOOLS AND SCHOOLMASTERS\r\n\r\n     The School of Life--Borrowed Magazines--Reading Dickens--Crooks's\r\n     Humour and Story-Telling Faculty--Discovering Scott--Declaiming\r\n     Shakespeare--Books that influenced him.\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle education of the ordinary kind came into Will's life as a lad. We\r\nhave seen that he turned out before five o'clock every morning at eight\r\nyears of age to take milk round for a wage of sixpence a week. Soon\r\nafter coming out of the workhouse he got a job as errand boy at a\r\ngrocer's at two shillings a week. At eleven he was in a blacksmith's\r\nshop, where he stayed until at fourteen he was apprenticed to the trade\r\nof cooper.\r\n\r\n\"In a sense, my training for becoming a servant of the people has been\r\nbetter than a University training,\" he tells you. \"My University has\r\nbeen the common people--the common people whom Christ loved, and loved\r\nso well that He needs must make so many of us. The man trained as I have\r\nbeen amid the poor streets and homes of London, who knows where the shoe\r\npinches and where there are no shoes at all, has more practical\r\nknowledge of the needs and sufferings of the people than the man who has\r\nbeen to the recognised Universities.\r\n\r\n\"I am the last to despise education. I have felt the need of more\r\neducation all my life. But I do protest against the idea that only those\r\nwho have been through the Universities or public schools are fit to be\r\nthe nation's rulers and servants. Legislation by the intellectuals is\r\nthe last thing we want. See to what extremes it sometimes leads. There\r\nwas a case under the Workmen's Compensation Act when eight leading\r\nlawyers argued for hours whether a well thirty feet deep was a building\r\nthirty feet high. Finally they decided solemnly that it was not. That\r\nwas legislation by the intellectuals being carried out by the\r\nintellectuals.\"\r\n\r\nHe once complained in the House of Commons that Mr. Balfour--then Prime\r\nMinister--was using a dead language in answering a Labour Member's\r\nquestion. He had asked whether the Aliens Bill would take precedence\r\nover Redistribution. Mr. Balfour replied that the two things were not at\r\nall _in pari materia_.\r\n\r\n\"Will the right hon. gentleman please speak in English?\" pleaded the\r\nquestioner. \"It is well known both inside and outside this House that I\r\ndo not know Latin.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Balfour said that what he meant to convey was that you could not\r\ncompare resolutions with a Bill, because a Bill involved a number of\r\ndifferent stages, while the other dealt with the matter as one\r\nsubstantive question.\r\n\r\n\"A very loose translation,\" remarked a Member, amid the laughter of the\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nCrooks was learning life at the time other lads are usually learning\r\nLatin. And his knowledge of life, carrying with it an unbounded\r\nsympathy with suffering, an intense love of truth and justice, has\r\nproved more useful to him and to the class he serves than any knowledge\r\nof a dead language would.\r\n\r\nYet it was a pleasure to him to go down to Oxford in the early part of\r\n1906 to speak on the need for University men taking up social work. It\r\nwas a greater pleasure to receive on his return the following letter\r\nfrom one in authority at Christ Church College:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     I am writing a line thanking you again for your kindness in coming\r\n     and speaking here on Saturday. From all sides I hear nothing but\r\n     commendation of your speech. There was a considerable number of our\r\n     men present, and as I surveyed them I was glad to see that some who\r\n     are really thinking about things were impressed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrooks always tells you that his best \"schoolmaster\" was his mother, the\r\nrighteous working woman who could not read a line or write a word.\r\n\r\nShe and one of her boys spent nearly three hours one evening preparing a\r\nletter to a far-away sister, the mother painfully composing the\r\nsentences, the lad painfully writing them down. The glorious epistle was\r\nat last complete, the first great triumph of a combined intellectual\r\neffort between mother and son. Proudly they held the letter to the\r\ncandle-light to dry the ink, when the flame caught it, and behold! the\r\nwork of three laborious hours destroyed in three seconds. It was more\r\nthan they could bear. Mother and son sat down and cried together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CROOKS FAMILY.\r\n\r\n(_Will is the second child from the right, looking over his father's\r\nleft shoulder._)]\r\n\r\n\"I have nothing but praise for my other schoolmaster,\" says Crooks. \"I\r\nmean the schoolmaster at the old George Green schools in East India Dock\r\nRoad. They were elementary schools then, and we paid a penny a week,\r\nthough even that small sum for all of us meant a sacrifice for mother.\r\nThe schoolmaster there was essentially a kind man. He had me under his\r\nteaching in the Sunday school as well as in the day school. During the\r\nfew years I was with him prior to my workhouse days I learnt much that\r\nhas been of service to me ever since.\"\r\n\r\nNeither books nor papers found their way into Shirbutt Street. The first\r\npaper he remembers reading was _The British Workman_, brought\r\noccasionally to the little house in High Street just after the workhouse\r\ndays. Then came a short spell of penny dreadfuls, from among which\r\n\"Alone in a Pirate's Lair\" stands out in memory riotous and reeking to\r\nthis day.\r\n\r\nThough the mother could not read herself, she encouraged her children by\r\nborrowing occasional magazines and inviting them to read the contents to\r\nher and her neighbours.\r\n\r\n\"I was about ten or eleven when _The Leisure Hour_ and _The Sunday at\r\nHome_ were started, and mother and the neighbours used to get these and\r\nask us boys to read the stories to them.\r\n\r\n\"I owe something to an old man who went round the poor people's houses\r\nselling books. From him I got some of Dickens's novels. I suddenly found\r\nmyself in a new and delightful world. Having been in the workhouse\r\nmyself, how I revelled in Oliver Twist! How I laughed at Bumble and the\r\ngentleman in the white waistcoat! I have seen that white waistcoat,\r\npompous and truculent, administering the Poor Law many times since.\r\n\r\n\"After the unceasing hunger I experienced in the workhouse, you can\r\nguess how I sympathised with Oliver in his demand for more. I thought\r\nthat a delightful touch in one of our L.C.C. day schools the other day.\r\nThe teacher asked a class what books they liked best.\r\n\r\n\"'Oliver Twist,' came one little chap's answer.\r\n\r\n\"'Why?'\r\n\r\n\"'Because he asked for more.'\"\r\n\r\nThis early reading of Dickens may have helped to develop his own quaint,\r\nrich humour. Will Crooks often reminds one of Charles Dickens. He knows\r\nthe Londoner of to-day, his oddities, whimsicalities, his trials,\r\nhumours, and sorrows, as thoroughly as Dickens knew the Londoner of\r\nfifty years ago. Many a time I have journeyed with him down to his home\r\nin East London, after he had finished a hard day's work in Parliament or\r\non the London County Council, possibly having been defeated on some\r\npublic question in a way that would make many men despair; and yet how\r\neasily he has put aside all the worries and work, and made the journey\r\ndelightful by his unfailing fund of Cockney anecdotes. He is one of the\r\nrare story-tellers you meet with in a lifetime. The charm, too, of all\r\nhis stories is that they never relate to what he has read, but always\r\nto what he has heard or observed himself.\r\n\r\nSome unknown friend at Yarmouth, who doubtless had heard him speak,\r\nseems to have been impressed by this ready way he has of taking his\r\nillustrations from the common things around him. Under the initials\r\nA. H. S. he sent the following \"Limerick\" to _London Opinion_:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     We smile when he's funny, or witty,\r\n     We yawn when he's wise: more's the pity,\r\n       For this best of the \"Crooks\"\r\n       Draws from life, not from books,\r\n     When he pleads for the people or city.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Dickens the lad discovered Scott. \"It was an event in my life\r\nwhen, in an old Scotch magazine, I read a fascinating criticism of\r\n'Ivanhoe.' Nothing would satisfy me until I had got the book; and then\r\nScott took a front place among my favourite authors.\r\n\r\n\"I was in my teens then, reading everything I could lay hands on. I used\r\nto follow closely public events in the newspapers. Not long ago I met a\r\nman in a car with whom I remonstrated for some rude behaviour to the\r\npassengers. He looked at me in amazement when I called him by his name.\r\n\r\n\"'Why,' he said, 'you must be that boy Will Crooks I knew long ago. Do\r\nyou know what I remember about you? I can see you now tossing your apron\r\noff in the dinner-hour and squatting down in the workshop with a paper\r\nin your hand.'\"\r\n\r\nCrooks was still an apprentice when, as he describes it, the great\r\nliterary event of his life occurred.\r\n\r\n\"On my way home from work one Saturday afternoon I was lucky enough to\r\npick up Homer's 'Iliad' for twopence at an old bookstall. After dinner I\r\ntook it upstairs--we were able to afford an upstairs room by that\r\ntime--and read it lying on the bed. What a revelation it was to me!\r\nPictures of romance and beauty I had never dreamed of suddenly opened up\r\nbefore my eyes. I was transported from the East End to an enchanted\r\nland. It was a rare luxury to a working lad like me just home from work\r\nto find myself suddenly among the heroes and nymphs and gods of ancient\r\nGreece.\"\r\n\r\nThe lad's imagination was also fired by \"The Pilgrim's Progress.\"\r\n\r\n\"I often think of that splendid passage describing the passing over the\r\nriver and the entry into Heaven of Christian and Faithful. I can\r\nsympathise with Arnold of Rugby when he said, 'I never dare trust myself\r\nto read that passage aloud.'\"\r\n\r\nWhile in the blacksmith's shop he learnt many portions of Shakespeare,\r\nwith a decided preference for Hamlet. Often in the little forge the men\r\nwould say, \"Give us a bit of Shakespeare, Will.\" The lad, nothing loath,\r\nwould declaim before them, more often than not in a mock heroic strain\r\nthat greatly delighted his grimy workmates.\r\n\r\nLike many other members of the Labour Party, he was greatly influenced\r\nin his youth by the principles of \"Unto this Last\" and \"Alton Locke.\"\r\nLater in life he was set thinking seriously by a course of University\r\nLectures on Political Economy delivered in Poplar by Mr. G. Armitage\r\nSmith.\r\n\r\nQuietly he began building up a little library of his own, supplemented\r\nin later years by an occasional autograph copy from authors whose\r\nfriendship he had made. Father Dolling, for instance, sent him a copy of\r\nhis \"Ten Years in a Portsmouth Slum,\" inscribed:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     WILL CROOKS.--The story of a kind of trying to do in a different\r\n     way what he is doing.--With the author's best Christmas wishes,\r\n     1898.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the flyleaf of this book Crooks keeps the following letter, received\r\nafter his election to Parliament from the author's sister:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     DEAR MR. CROOKS,--I have just seen the papers, and must send you a\r\n     word of congratulation on your success. If, as I believe, the\r\n     blessed dead are allowed to watch over and help us, I am sure my\r\n     dear brother is thinking of you and praying that in your new sphere\r\n     of usefulness you may be helped to do God's will.--Truly yours,\r\n\r\n     GERALDINE DOLLING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe book that he values most to-day is a pleasant little story for boys\r\ncalled \"Joe the Giant Killer.\" It was given to him by the author, Dr.\r\nChandler, Bishop of Bloemfontein, when rector of Poplar. The reason he\r\nvalues it so is because the printed dedication reads:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"_To_ WILL CROOKS, L.C.C.\r\n     _In memory of many years\r\n     Of delightful comradeship in Poplar._\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen, after the big victory in Woolwich, Crooks was able to add M.P. as\r\nwell as L.C.C. after his name, there came among hundreds of other\r\ncongratulations a cabled cheer from South Africa. It was signed\r\n\"Chandler.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nROUND THE HAUNTS OF HIS BOYHOOD\r\n\r\n     Proud of his Birthplace--Famous Residents at Blackwall--Memories of\r\n     Nelson's Flagship--Stealing a Body from a Gibbet--A Waterman who\r\n     Remembered Dickens.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf many interesting days spent with Crooks in Poplar, one stands out as\r\nthe day on which he showed me some of the haunts of his boyhood.\r\n\r\nPoplar is always picturesque with the glimpses it gives of ships' masts\r\nrising out of the Docks above the roofs of houses. With Crooks as guide,\r\nthis rambling district of Dockland, foolishly imagined by many people to\r\nbe wholly a centre of squalor, becomes as romantic as a mediæval town.\r\n\r\nIt was not always grey and poor, as so many parts of it are to-day,\r\nthough even these are not without their quaint and pleasant places.\r\n\r\nWe wended through several of its grey streets, making for the river at\r\nBlackwall. Everywhere women and children, as well as men, whom we passed\r\ngreeted Crooks cheerily.\r\n\r\n\"Can you wonder so many of our people take to drink?\" And he pointed to\r\nthe shabby little houses, all let out in tenements, in the street where\r\nhe was born. \"Look at the homes they are forced to live in! The men\r\ncan't invite their mates round, so they meet at 'The Spotted Dog' of an\r\nevening. During the day the women often drift to the same place. The\r\nboys and girls cannot do their courting in these overcrowded homes. They\r\nmake love in the streets, and soon they too begin to haunt the\r\npublic-houses.\"\r\n\r\nHe changed his tone when we entered the famous old High Street that runs\r\nbetween the West India Docks and Blackwall. He pointed out the house\r\nwhere he spent many years of his boyhood after his parents moved from\r\nShirbutt Street. The old home is associated with his errand-boy\r\nexperiences. In those days he finished work at midnight on Saturdays,\r\nand knowing that his parents would be in bed, he often lingered in the\r\nHigh Street into the early hours of Sunday, playing with other lads who,\r\nlike himself, had just finished work.\r\n\r\nAs we continued our way down the High Street together, he surprised me\r\nby his wonderful knowledge of the neighbourhood. Here was a Poplar man\r\nproud of Poplar. He told me that the now silent High Street was at one\r\ntime a sort of sailors' fair-ground, like the old Ratcliff Highway. It\r\nwas there, he said, that Poplar had its beginning, according to the\r\nhistorian Stow. There shipwrights and other marine men built large\r\nhouses for themselves, with small ones around for seamen.\r\n\r\nNot for these people alone were the houses built. Worthy citizens of\r\nLondon lived down there. Sir John de Poultney, four times Lord Mayor,\r\nlived in a quaint old house in Coldharbour, at Blackwall, that stood\r\nuntil recently. This same house once formed the home of the discoverer,\r\nSebastian Cabot. It was there that Cabot made friends with Sir Thomas\r\nSpert, Vice-Admiral of England, who also had a house at Poplar, and\r\npromised Cabot a good ship of the Government's for a voyage of\r\ndiscovery. And, later still, Sir Walter Raleigh is said to have been the\r\ntenant, and of course legend credits him with having smoked one of his\r\nearliest pipes there.\r\n\r\nGone are the old houses now, with the old traditions, the old gaiety,\r\nthe old mad enthusiasm for the sea. In his day the Blackwall seaman was\r\na dare-devil, efficient man, eagerly coveted by shipowners and captains\r\nalike. Never did a ship sail from Blackwall during Crooks's schooldays\r\nwithout most of the boys staying away from school, regardless of results\r\nto their skins the next morning, in order to join in the farewell\r\ncheering from the foreshore. The welcome home to the Blackwall ships was\r\nsomething to remember. It was always a bitter disappointment to the\r\nboys, since it robbed them of an opportunity of playing truant, if a\r\nship came home and docked during the night, having come up, as the old\r\ntide-master used to say, and brought her own news.\r\n\r\nLittle remains to suggest the sea in Poplar High Street to-day. The old\r\nhighway has lost its old glory. The old folks have forsaken the old\r\nhomesteads. Of the few old buildings that remain, nearly every one has\r\nbeen cut up into small shops and tenements. One or two general dealers\r\nstill pose as ships' outfitters, and an occasional shop remains as a\r\nmarine store, as though in a final feeble struggle to preserve the old\r\ntraditions.\r\n\r\nCrooks recollected well the period that costermongers thronged this\r\nriverside highway. They came about the time seamen were deserting it, so\r\nthat the street for some time lost nothing of its noise or bustle. The\r\nday came when they, too, departed, seeking a more profitable field in\r\nChrisp Street, on the northern side of East India Dock Road, where to\r\nthis day they still hold carnival. That they carried away something of\r\nthe seafaring character of their former highway is borne out by the\r\nnautical turn they give to some of their remarks.\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" cried a fish-dealer of their number the other day, holding aloft\r\na haddock, \"wot price this 'ere 'addick?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tuppence,\" suggested a woman bystander.\r\n\r\n\"Wot! tuppence! 'Ow would you like to get a ship, an' go out to sea an'\r\nfish for 'addicks to sell for tuppence in foggy weather like this?\"\r\n\r\nAs we passed down that portion of the High Street that skirts the\r\nRecreation Ground, Crooks pointed out the quaint old church of St.\r\nMatthias. He told me it was the oldest church in Poplar, built as a\r\nchapel-of-ease to the mother church of East London, St. Dunstan's. Then\r\nit was that all the parishes that now go to make up the teeming Tower\r\nHamlets were comprised in Stepney. As the Port of London in those days\r\nwas confined to the Pool and lower reaches and to the riverside hamlets\r\nof the East End, that was why people born at sea were often entered as\r\nhaving been born in the parish of Stepney.\r\n\r\nSt. Matthias' Church afterwards became the chapel of the old East India\r\nCompany. Poplar people sometimes call it that to this day. The Company's\r\nalmshouses were near, and the chapel ministered to the aged almoners\r\nalone. According to tradition, the teak pillars in the church served as\r\nmasts in vessels of the Spanish Armada. Upon the ceiling is the\r\ncoat-of-arms of the original East India Company. Adjoining the church is\r\nthe picturesque vicarage, where Crooks pointed out the coat-of-arms\r\nadopted by the United Company a hundred years later on the amalgamation\r\nwith the New East India Company.\r\n\r\nThis chapel contains a monument to the memory of George Green, who\r\nstands out as Poplar's worthiest philanthropist. Schools, churches, and\r\ncharities in Poplar to-day testify to his generosity. He was one of the\r\nowners of the famous Blackwall Shipbuilding Yard, that turned out some\r\nof the sturdiest of the wooden walls of England. They were proud in the\r\nshipyard of the _Venerable_ and the _Theseus_, the former Lord Duncan's\r\nflagship at the battle of Camperdown, the latter at one time Nelson's\r\nflagship, in the cockpit of which his arm was amputated.\r\n\r\nThe people of old Poplar had at times unpleasant things to tolerate.\r\nSometimes the pirates hung at Execution Dock, higher up the river, would\r\nbe brought down, still on their gibbets, and suspended for a long\r\nperiod at a place near Blackwall Point, as a warning to all seafarers\r\nentering the Port of London.\r\n\r\nOne of the old East India Company pensioners used to tell Crooks's\r\nfather how one of the bodies hanging on a gibbet was stolen during the\r\nnight, under romantic circumstances. An old waterman at the stairs was\r\nstartled at a late hour by a young and ladylike girl coming ashore in a\r\nboat and asking him to lend a hand with her father, who, she said, was\r\ndead drunk in the bottom of the skiff. A youth was with her, and the\r\nwaterman assisted them to carry the supposed drunken man to a carriage\r\nwhich was waiting. Not until the pirate's body was missing in the\r\nmorning did the old waterman know the truth.\r\n\r\nWe reached the river ourselves from the Blackwall end of the High\r\nStreet, while Crooks was giving me these entertaining glimpses into the\r\npast of his native Poplar. The sight of Blackwall Causeway and the river\r\ncrowded with craft instantly reminded him of the last mutiny in the\r\nThames, of which he has gruesome recollections, associated with bad\r\ndreams as a lad, caused by the knowledge that dead seamen lay in the\r\nbuilding adjoining his home. It was here at Blackwall Point that the\r\ncrew of the Peruvian frigate mutinied in 1861. He relates graphically\r\nhow the eleven men who were shot dead on the ship were brought ashore\r\nand laid in the mortuary next his mother's house by the casual ward.\r\n\r\nThe old watermen at the head of the Causeway, waiting to row people\r\nacross to the Greenwich side, welcomed Crooks with a cheerful word as we\r\napproached. They were soon full of talk. The eldest told how he went to\r\nsea as a boy in the famous wooden ships turned out of Blackwall Yard.\r\nHis aged companion remembered the stage coaches coming down from London\r\nto Blackwall. He was proud also of a memory of Queen Victoria's visit to\r\nthe neighbourhood to see a Chinese junk.\r\n\r\nThe two ancient watermen soon overflowed with reminiscences. One\r\nremembered his grandfather telling how King George the Fourth would come\r\ndown to see the ships built at Blackwall, and how on one occasion a\r\nsailor who had come ashore and got drunk took a pint of ale to his\r\nMajesty in a pewter and asked him to drink to the Army and Navy.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed the other, fetching a sigh; \"but don't you remember that\r\nold Yarmouth fisherman who used to bring his smack round here from the\r\nRoads and sell herrings out of it on this very Causeway?\"\r\n\r\n\"Remember! What do _you_ think? That was the old man who would never\r\nkeep farthings. In the evening, when he'd got a handful in the course of\r\nthe day's trade, he would pitch them in the river for the boys to find.\"\r\n\r\n\"Likely enough,\" interposed Crooks. \"I mudlarked about here myself as a\r\nlad.\"\r\n\r\nThe eldest of the ancient watermen would have it that this old boy from\r\nYarmouth was the original of Mr. Peggotty, and that it was at Blackwall\r\nDickens first made his acquaintance. He said he had often seen Dickens\r\nhimself about those parts.\r\n\r\nWe ventured a doubt.\r\n\r\n\"Why, bless my life!\" he cried; \"ain't I talked to him at the Causeway\r\nhere many a time?\"\r\n\r\nThis, of course, was unanswerable, so we asked what Dickens did when\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThe ancient waterman thought a moment.\r\n\r\n\"What did Dickens do?\" he ruminated. \"Now, let me see. What _did_\r\nDickens do? I know: Dickens used to go afloat!\"\r\n\r\nThe other declared that Dickens did more than that: he would often go\r\ninto the fishing-smack.\r\n\r\nWe immediately assumed that it was the fishing-smack of the old Yarmouth\r\nsalt that was meant. We were wrong. It was another \"Fishing Smack,\" one\r\nof the quaint old taverns by the river still standing in Coldharbour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nIN TRAINING FOR A CRAFTSMAN\r\n\r\n     Three years in a Smithy--Provoking a\r\n     Carman--Apprenticeship--Winning a Nickname--Activity of an Idle\r\n     Apprentice--\"Not Dead, but Drunk\"--A Boisterous Celebration--The\r\n     Workman's Pride in His Work.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe three years in the blacksmith's shop in Limehouse Causeway, that\r\ncommenced at the age of eleven after the errand-boy period, were years\r\nof hard work and long hours. The lad's working day began at six in the\r\nmorning and often did not close until eight at night. Working overtime\r\nmeant ten and twelve midnight before the day's work was done. He was\r\npaid for the overtime at the rate of a penny an hour.\r\n\r\nHe was kept hard at it all the time. Once, in the excitement of a\r\nGeneral Election, in the days of the old hustings, he stole away from\r\nthe forge for an hour. The smith had returned in his absence, and\r\ninquired angrily where he had been.\r\n\r\n\"Only to see the state of the poll.\"\r\n\r\n\"_You'll_ know the state of the poll on Saturday, young fellow.\"\r\n\r\nHe did. A shilling was taken from his week's wages.\r\n\r\nIt was a heavy blow. It delayed a promised pair of new trousers. The\r\nneed for a new pair was constantly being brought to his notice in a\r\nmore or less personal way. The biggest affront came from a tall boy at a\r\nshop he passed on the way home.\r\n\r\n\"Hi!\" this youth would call after him. \"Look at the kid wot's put his\r\nlegs too far frew his trowsis!\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the little chap in the short trousers was immensely proud\r\nto be at work. He would blacken his face before leaving for home so as\r\nto look like a working man.\r\n\r\nMany a long day's search had he before getting that job. He spent hours\r\none morning in calling at nearly all the shops in the two miles' length\r\nof Commercial Road between Poplar and the City. But nobody wanted so\r\nsmall a boy. On his way back, not yet wholly disheartened, he turned\r\ndown Limehouse Causeway and peeped in at the smithy.\r\n\r\n\"Can you blow the bellows, little 'un?\" he was asked.\r\n\r\nCouldn't he; you just try him!\r\n\r\nThey tried him for an hour, then told him he was just the boy they\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\nThey got a lot of smiths' work in connection with the fitting out of\r\nsmall vessels in Limehouse Basin and the West India Docks. The first job\r\nat which Will assisted was on board the barque _Violet_.\r\n\r\nThe Causeway where the smithy stood was so narrow that carts could not\r\npass each other. Two carmen driving in opposite directions met just\r\noutside the smithy door one afternoon. Neither would give way, and they\r\nfilled the air with lurid fancies. Young Will came out of the smithy and\r\ntook the part of the one whom he believed to have the right on his side.\r\n\r\nSeizing the bridle of the other driver's horse, he commenced to back the\r\ncart down the lane. The man's flow of language increased as he tried to\r\nget at the lad with his whip. Will dodged first to one side and then to\r\nthe other, then under the horse's nose, eluding the lash every time. At\r\nlast he got the cart backed right out of the lane, allowing the other\r\ndriver to pass in triumph.\r\n\r\nThe enraged carman sprang down and chased the lad back into the smithy.\r\nWill had just time to spring behind the big bellows out of sight before\r\nthe other appeared foaming at the door. With many oaths the man swore he\r\nwould have vengeance on the boy some day, come what would.\r\n\r\nSome years afterwards Crooks found himself at work in the same yard as\r\nhis burly enemy, but time, which had made little difference to the man,\r\nhad transformed the boy out of all recognition. Crooks asked him if he\r\nremembered the event.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; and if I came across that youngster to-day I'd break every bone in\r\nhis body.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think you would, Jack,\" Crooks replied, preparing to take off\r\nhis coat.\r\n\r\nThen the carman understood.\r\n\r\nIn his third year at the smithy Will was getting six shillings a week,\r\nwith something more than a penny an hour for overtime. Small though the\r\nwages were, they were very welcome at home; and it meant a great deal\r\nto his mother when she sacrificed more than half this amount in the\r\nlad's best interest.\r\n\r\nShe was as determined that her boys should learn a trade as that they\r\nshould learn to read and write. She took Will away from the smithy and\r\nhis six shillings a week, when she found he was not to be taught the\r\nbusiness but to be merely a smiths' labourer, and she apprenticed him to\r\nthe trade of cooper at a weekly wage of half a crown.\r\n\r\n\"The sacrifice of a few shillings a week,\" says Crooks, \"which mother\r\nmade in order that I should learn a trade was only one of the many\r\nthings she did for me as a boy for which I have blessed her memory in\r\nmanhood many times. I really don't know now how she managed to feed us\r\nall, after losing my three-and-six a week. I know that she always put up\r\na good dinner in a handkerchief for me to take to work. It may have got\r\nsmaller towards the end of the week, like many of the men's. I remember\r\none Monday dinner-time flopping down on a saw-tub and opening my\r\nhandkerchief as the foreman passed.\r\n\r\n\"'That looks a good meal to begin the week on,' he said. 'I see how it\r\nis;--\r\n\r\n\r\n     It's Monday plenty,\r\n     Tuesday some,\r\n     Wednesday a little,\r\n     Thursday none,\r\n     Don't worry about Friday,\r\n     You get your money on Saturday.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the workmen was a thinker and reformer far ahead of his times. It\r\nwas dangerous in those days for workmen to give expression to advanced\r\nviews, and as he was a married man he made no display of his opinions.\r\nHe seems to have seen promise in young Will, for he talked to him freely\r\non social and political matters, encouraging him to read by lending him\r\nbooks and papers, and inspiring him with an enthusiasm for the teaching\r\nof John Bright.\r\n\r\nSo much so, that at home Will was nicknamed Young John Bright. An uncle,\r\nlooking in on the eve of the General Election of 1868, said jokingly,\r\n\"Now, young John Bright, tell us all about what is going to happen.\"\r\nNothing loath, Will delivered a long speech on the political situation,\r\nand foretold, among other things, that the Liberals would sweep the\r\ncountry, and that one of their first acts would be to disestablish the\r\nChurch of Ireland. The prophecy, needless to say, was fulfilled.\r\n\r\nWill was one of half-a-dozen apprentices in the coopering establishment.\r\nWhile still the youngest among them he made his mark by acting as\r\nspokesman in a sudden emergency. The lads thought they had a grievance\r\nunder the piece-rate system. They went in a body to the head of the\r\nfirm, the eldest primed with a well-rehearsed speech stating their case.\r\n\r\nIf Will saved the situation, he began by nearly bringing disaster upon\r\nit. It happened that the spokesman's father was an undertaker in\r\nStepney, and that on Sundays the lad, with becoming gravity, frequently\r\nwalked as a mute at funerals.\r\n\r\nJust as the solemn procession of aggrieved apprentices was about to\r\nenter the office, the employer's wondering eye upon them through the\r\nwindow, Will called out in a stage whisper:\r\n\r\n\"Now, Joe, put on your best Sunday face!\"\r\n\r\nThe fearful tension was broken. All the boys burst into laughter. The\r\nlads tumbled over each other in their eagerness to get outside the\r\npassage. When the head of the firm opened his door Will alone remained.\r\n\r\n\"What's all this about, Crooks?\"\r\n\r\nThe youngest apprentice thereupon briefly ran over the lads' grievances,\r\nand on being asked why the deputation fled in laughter, he explained the\r\nmeaning of the Sunday face.\r\n\r\nThe employer laughed as boisterously as his boys. He told Crooks to go\r\nback to work, promising that the lads should have fair play. That very\r\nday he issued orders placing the apprentices under better conditions.\r\n\r\nOne of the lads, with an unconquerable liking for lying in bed, had not\r\nturned up by nine o'clock on a certain morning. The other apprentices\r\nstole out with a barrow and went to his house with the object of\r\nwheeling him to work.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later the lad rushed into the cooperage panting and\r\ndishevelled, his clothes torn, his hat missing.\r\n\r\n\"Done 'em!\" he gasped, after the manner of Alfred Jingle. \"I rushed out\r\no' the back door, got over the wall, over the next wall, fell on a\r\nflower-bed, man came out (such langwidge!), climbed his wall afore he\r\ncould ketch me, landed clean on a dog kennel, dog tore me clothes, got\r\nover another wall--into the street at last--boys caught sight o' me,\r\nhowling chase with barrow, woman let me run through her house, over\r\nanother wall. Done 'em!\"\r\n\r\nSomething more than laziness explained the occasional absence of others\r\nfrom work. Certain of the men would be missing for two or three days.\r\nDuring an unusually long absence of one of the older coopers, the men\r\nand lads rigged up a dummy figure, dressing it in whatever clothes of\r\ntheir own they could spare. They placed the dummy in an improvised\r\ncoffin by the side of their missing comrade's bench, with an imitation\r\ntombstone at the head, bearing the inscription, \"Not dead, but drunk.\"\r\n\r\nThe morning came when the delinquent turned up. A deep silence fell over\r\nthe workshop as he entered. Men and apprentices alike suddenly appeared\r\nto be absorbed in work. The late-comer pretended not to see the effigy\r\nby his bench. With quiet deliberation he took off his coat, rolled up\r\nhis sleeves, and lighted the furnace-fire. No one spoke. The old man\r\nbrought two handfuls of shavings and piled them on the fire until it\r\nroared again. Then suddenly he seized the dummy figure and hurled it on\r\nthe flames.\r\n\r\nEverybody sprang forward to snatch his garments from the fire. One\r\nrescued his coat, another his vest, another his cap, another his\r\nmuffler, another his pair of boots, the old man belabouring each in\r\nturn.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" he cried with a chuckle, as the singed garments were dragged away.\r\n\"I knew that would find you all out.\"\r\n\r\nQuaint and boisterous customs were observed when an apprentice was out\r\nof his time. The greater part of the day was given up by men and boys\r\nalike to revelry and horse-play.\r\n\r\nThe ceremonies began at about eleven o'clock in the morning, to be kept\r\nup for the rest of the day. First, the apprentice was seized and put\r\ninto a hot barrel. Round him stood some fifty men and boys checking\r\nevery attempt he made to get out, tapping him with hammers on the head\r\nand fingers and shoulders every time he made an effort to escape. When\r\nhis clothes--the last he was to wear as an apprentice--had been singed\r\nin the barrel out of all further use, he would be dragged out and tossed\r\nin the air by about a dozen of the strongest men.\r\n\r\nOnly once did the employer try to stop these boisterous interludes. He\r\nnever tried again. The men laid hold of him, and for about five minutes\r\ntreated him to a vigorous tossing.\r\n\r\nIt then became the bruised and singed apprentice's privilege to pay for\r\nbread and cheese and drink. In the afternoon the men turned the yard\r\ninto an imitation fair. Flags and bunting were put up and side shows\r\nwere improvised. One feature was to persuade the fattest men to walk the\r\ntight-rope.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, Will had a happy time as an apprentice, working hard and\r\nlaughing hard, more than once threatened with dismissal because his\r\nspirit of fun led him into mischief. He became a good craftsman, and to\r\nthis day boasts of being as skilful at his own trade as any man. He\r\nattributes this to the old spirit of craftsmanship that held good in his\r\nday. One incident during his apprenticeship helped to make him take a\r\npride in what he made with his own hands. An old workman in the shop,\r\nafter finishing a piece of work, set it in the middle of the floor and\r\nwalked round it admiringly several times.\r\n\r\n\"'Pon my honour, one would think you'd made a thousand-horse-power\r\nengine,\" said the apprentice.\r\n\r\n\"Never you mind, sonny,\" replied the old workman. \"Whether it's a\r\nthousand-horse-power engine or not, _I made it myself_!\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the spirit I want to see revived among workmen to-day,\" Crooks\r\ntold the Labour Co-partnership Association in 1905, relating the\r\nincident at their annual exhibition at the Crystal Palace. He went on to\r\nsay:\r\n\r\n\r\n     I want to see workmen proud of what they make with their own hands.\r\n     That is impossible in many workshops to-day because of the soulless\r\n     way in which they are conducted. Many workmen have got the idea\r\n     they only exist for what other people can get out of them. I blame\r\n     employers as much as workmen for this state of things. There are in\r\n     the country some excellent employers. Unfortunately, they are\r\n     becoming fewer. The individual employer is going out, and the\r\n     limited liability company coming in, having as its one object the\r\n     making of profit, utterly regardless of the bodies or souls of the\r\n     men or women from whom the profit is wrung. The result of running\r\n     works and factories for company dividends only has destroyed the\r\n     old school of masters and men, both of whom had a pride in their\r\n     work, both of whom stamped their work with the mark of their own\r\n     individuality.\r\n\r\n     To get back to a better state of things workmen must become their\r\n     own masters, and the Co-Partnership Association is showing men the\r\n     way. It is teaching them to live and work with and for each other.\r\n     I want men who groan under the injustice of so much in our\r\n     industrial system to understand that they can do much for\r\n     themselves. By combination and co-operation they can run businesses\r\n     of their own. But they must first take to the water before they can\r\n     swim. It means discipline, but trade unionism has meant discipline.\r\n     The administrative capacity of workmen can be developed to an\r\n     enormous extent yet.\r\n\r\n     How are we going to train our men and women workers to take on the\r\n     responsibilities of regulating their own lot in a better manner?\r\n     Trade unionists are now learning that instead of spending money on\r\n     strikes it is better to spend it in starting workshops of their\r\n     own. The time has come when Labour leaders and others might well\r\n     cease talking to the workers about their power and begin talking to\r\n     them about their responsibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day after this speech he received the following letter from George\r\nJacob Holyoake, a few months before that veteran co-operator passed\r\naway:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Against my will I was prevented from being present at the Crystal\r\n     Palace, but that does not disqualify me from expressing my thanks\r\n     for the wise and practical speech you made--in every way\r\n     admirable.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTRAMPING THE COUNTRY FOR WORK\r\n\r\n     Marriage--Dismissed as an Agitator--Home broken up--\"On the\r\n     Road\"--Timely Help at Burton--Finding Work at\r\n     Liverpool--Bereavement--Back in London--A Second Tramp to\r\n     Liverpool--Feelings of an \"Out-of-Work.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a grey morning in the December of 1871 two young people came out of\r\nSt. Thomas's Church, Bethnal Green, man and wife. Both were only\r\nnineteen years of age. The husband was Will Crooks; his wife the\r\ndaughter of an East London shipwright named South.\r\n\r\nThey set up their home in Poplar, near the coopering yard where Will was\r\nemployed. At first they had to be content with apartments; then came a\r\nsmall tenement; soon after a little house of their own.\r\n\r\nIt was fair and pleasant sailing for the first two or three years. He\r\ngot a journeyman's full wages the first week he was out of his\r\napprenticeship. It seemed as though he were to have an unbroken run of\r\ngood fortune. The bright hopes soon collapsed.\r\n\r\nGood craftsmanship and trade unionism, blended as they were in Crooks,\r\nmade him rebel against certain conditions of his work. Finally he\r\nrefused to use inferior timber on a job, and objected to excessive\r\novertime. Although the youngest among them, he addressed the workmen on\r\nthe subject. A few days afterwards he was dismissed.\r\n\r\nHe took his notice lightly enough, confident that as master of his trade\r\nhe could soon secure work again.\r\n\r\nIt was not to be. Every shop and yard in London was closed to him. Word\r\nhad gone round that he was an agitator.\r\n\r\nTry as he did, he could not break through the barrier that had been\r\nraised against him. Wherever he applied, whether in Rotherhithe,\r\nBattersea, Hackney, or Clerkenwell, he was known as the young fellow who\r\nwould not work with shoddy material and talked other men into the same\r\nview.\r\n\r\nThe experience was the same at every place of call.\r\n\r\n\"What's your name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Crooks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of Poplar?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's me.\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't want anyone.\"\r\n\r\nFrom several of these places he heard afterwards that the instant he was\r\ngone other men were taken on.\r\n\r\nSince London was a closed door to him, he turned his back upon it, and\r\nset out tramping the country in search of work. With a fully-paid-up\r\ntrade union card, he knew he could count on an occasional half-crown to\r\nhelp him on the way at those towns where his society had branches.\r\n\r\nHis home had to be broken up. His wife with their child went to her\r\nmother's, there to await for weary weeks the result of her husband's\r\nfirst quest into the country.\r\n\r\nThe only piece of good news came from Liverpool. Not until he reached\r\nthat city did he get a job. He tramped into Liverpool from\r\nBurton-on-Trent. Never in his life, either before or since, did a silver\r\ncoin mean so much to him as the half-crown given by a member of his own\r\ntrade to help him on the road as he set out from Burton for Liverpool.\r\n\r\nTwenty-nine years later Crooks was speaking at a meeting of co-operators\r\nin Burton when he recognised his former benefactor on the platform. He\r\ntold the audience of his last visit to their town, remarking how on that\r\noccasion no one but this man offered him hospitality, whereas now, if he\r\nlived to be a hundred and fifty years of age, he would not be able to\r\naccept all the invitations he had received from friends and would-be\r\nfriends to spend week-ends with them. His regret was, he told the\r\nmeeting, that those good people did not begin to ask him earlier and\r\nthat they did not think of asking other poor men in a similar plight to\r\nhis when he first entered Burton.\r\n\r\nBy the time he dragged himself into Liverpool he was without a sole to\r\nhis boots. The journey was completed on the uppers of his boots, with\r\nthe aid of string, a device he had learnt from friendly tramps on the\r\nroad. Having got what looked like a promising job, he invited his wife\r\nto join him with their child, enclosing the fare from his first week's\r\nwages.\r\n\r\nThis work in Liverpool had not been obtained without much weary\r\nsearching. A good friend to the young fellow in his distress was the\r\nY.M.C.A. in that city. Nearly thirty years later he addressed a crowded\r\npublic meeting in the large hall of the Liverpool Y.M.C.A. He had an\r\nenthusiastic welcome when he rose to speak.\r\n\r\n\r\n     I am very grateful to you for your kind welcome of me to-night.\r\n     This hall has carried my memory back to 1876 when I first visited\r\n     Liverpool. I was then looking for work, knowing what it was to want\r\n     a meal many a day. I don't know what I should have done without the\r\n     many kindnesses I met with from Liverpool people, and from none\r\n     more hearty and truly helpful than I received here in this\r\n     building.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Liverpool is associated with one of the saddest memories in his\r\nlife. This is how he refers to it:--\r\n\r\n\"My wife joined me, bringing our little girl, a bonny child of whom we\r\nwere immensely proud. The little one pined from the day it reached\r\nLiverpool and died within a month. I thought my wife would have followed\r\nthe child to the grave within a day or two. I never saw her so much\r\naffected in all my life. She pleaded to be taken away from that place.\r\n'Anywhere,' she said, 'only let's get away.' So we buried our little\r\ngirl in Liverpool one rainy Saturday afternoon, and came back to London\r\nto seek work the same night.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the most miserable railway journey of his life. If anything, the\r\nmisery was increased when as the dull dawn crept over London he and his\r\nwife stepped out of the train and walked the seven miles of silent\r\nstreets between Euston and Poplar.\r\n\r\nNo better fortune awaited them in London. The young husband sought work\r\nwith no success. News reached him that his trade was thriving again in\r\nLiverpool, so he set out to tramp there a second time.\r\n\r\n\"It is a weird experience, this, of wandering through England in search\r\nof a job,\" he says. \"You keep your heart up so long as you have\r\nsomething in your stomach, but when hunger steals upon you, then you\r\ndespair. Footsore and listless at the same time, you simply lose all\r\ninterest in the future.\r\n\r\n\"I have always been drawn towards Canon Liddon since reading an address\r\nof his in which he said that the roughest tramp upon the road was, in\r\nhis eyes, one who might come to be numbered among those favoured by\r\nChrist, and that the most brilliant and distinguished guest he had ever\r\nmet had no higher possibility than that.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing wearies one more than walking about hunting for employment\r\nwhich is not to be had. It is far harder than real work. The\r\nuncertainty, the despair, when you reach a place only to discover that\r\nyour journey is fruitless, are frightful. I've known a man say, 'Which\r\nway shall I go to-day?' Having no earthly idea which way to take, he\r\ntosses up a button. If the button comes down on one side he treks east;\r\nif on the other, he treks west.\r\n\r\n\"You can imagine the feeling when, after walking your boots off, a man\r\nsays to you, as he jingles sovereigns in his pocket, 'Why don't you\r\nwork?' That is what happened to me as I scoured the country between\r\nLondon and Liverpool, asking all the way for any kind of work to help me\r\nalong.\"\r\n\r\nI remember Crooks recalling his experience at a dinner-party given by\r\nthe Hon. Maud Stanley at her Westminster house. Crooks was then a\r\nfellow-member with Miss Stanley of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and\r\nshe invited us on that occasion to meet her friend Professor Wyckoff,\r\nthe American author, who wrote \"The Workers.\" In \"The Workers\" the\r\nauthor tells the story of how for a time he turned his back upon his\r\nusual well-to-do haunts in order to find out what earning one's own\r\nliving by tramping from place to place doing manual work was actually\r\nlike.\r\n\r\nCrooks, who, perhaps unconsciously to himself, had become the chief\r\nentertainer at table, showed Mr. Wyckoff in a moment that, realistic\r\nthough his experiences had been, he could not possibly enter into the\r\nfeelings of the real out-of-work who had nothing but sixpence between\r\nhim and starvation. However hard up Mr. Wyckoff might have been at\r\ntimes, he always had the consolation that if the worst came to the\r\nworst, funds awaited him at home. The ordinary workman tramping the\r\ncountry, said Crooks, had no such feeling of a sure foundation\r\nsomewhere, and it was only when you felt--as he had often felt when\r\ntramping for work--the utter hopelessness and loneliness of things,\r\nmade doubly worse by the knowledge that wife and children were suffering\r\ntoo, that you could enter fully into the feelings of an out-of-work.\r\n\r\nEvidently Mr. Wyckoff had not thought of this view before, but it seemed\r\nto me to mark the all-important difference between the amateur and the\r\nreal sufferer. There are some things no man can play at, and the game\r\nMr. Wyckoff, with the best intentions in the world, and with a good deal\r\nof self-imposed suffering, tried to play was one of them. There are some\r\nexperiences of life which no one can ever have for the seeking only.\r\nThey come; they can never be commanded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nONE OF LONDON'S UNEMPLOYED\r\n\r\n     A Casual Labourer at the Docks--A Typical Day's Tramping for Work\r\n     in London--Demoralising Effects of being Out of a Job--Emptying the\r\n     Cupboard for a Starving Family--Work found at last--Doing the\r\n     \"Railway Tavern\" a Bad Turn.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Liverpool again the prospect was not what he had been led to believe.\r\nAn odd job here and an odd job there still left him in want. At last, in\r\nresponse to the earnest entreaties of his wife, whom nothing could\r\npersuade to revisit Liverpool, he returned to take his chance again in\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nThis time Crooks determined to try to find work outside his own trade.\r\nHe went down to the Docks, where, by the aid of a friendly foreman, he\r\ngot occasional jobs as a casual labourer.\r\n\r\nThe sight of so many other poor fellows struggling at the Dock Gates\r\nproved more than he could bear. He turned away from the eager mass of\r\nmen one morning, resolved never to join in the demoralising scrimmage\r\nagain. With a trade of his own he felt he had no right to take a job for\r\nwhich so many men, more helpless than himself, were daily striving.\r\n\r\nThe morning he turned away finally from the Docks was the very one on\r\nwhich his friend the foreman had promised him a job if he turned up at\r\nthe gates by noon. The piteous appeals of the hundreds of other men for\r\nthe half-dozen places offered so affected him that he hung back and sat\r\ndown out of sight. He saw the foreman scan the crowd, looking for him,\r\nand then engage the number of men he wanted and go inside. Crooks went\r\noff to seek work in other quarters.\r\n\r\nOne typical day of tramping for work in London he described to me\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n\"I first went down to the river-side at Shadwell. No work was to be had\r\nthere. Then I called at another place in Limehouse. No hands wanted. So\r\nI looked in at home and got two slices of bread in paper and walked\r\neight miles to a cooper's yard in Tottenham. All in vain. I dragged\r\nmyself back to Clerkenwell. Still no luck. Then I turned towards home in\r\ndespair. By the time I reached Stepney I was dead beat, so I called at a\r\nfriend's in Commercial Road for a little rest. They gave me some Irish\r\nstew and twopence to ride home. I managed to walk home and gave the\r\ntwopence to my wife. She needed it badly.\r\n\r\n\"That year I know I walked London until my limbs ached again. I remember\r\nreturning home once by way of Tidal Basin, and turning into the Victoria\r\nDocks so utterly exhausted that I sank down on a coil of rope and slept\r\nfor hours.\r\n\r\n\"Another day I tramped as far as Beckton, again to no purpose. I must\r\nhave expressed keen disappointment in my face, for the good fellows in\r\nthe cooperage there made a collection for me, and I came home that night\r\nwith one and sevenpence.\r\n\r\n\"There are few things more demoralising to a man than to have a long\r\nspell of unemployment with day after day of fruitless searching for\r\nwork. It turns scores of decent men into loafers. Many a confirmed\r\nloafer to-day is simply what he is because our present social system\r\ntakes no account of a man being out of work. No one cares whether he\r\ngets a job or goes to the dogs. If he goes to the dogs the nation is the\r\nloser in a double sense. It has lost a worker, and therefore a\r\nwealth-maker. Secondly, it has to spend public money in maintaining him\r\nor his family in some kind of way, whether in workhouse, infirmary,\r\nprison or asylum.\r\n\r\n\"A man who is out of work for long nearly always degenerates. For\r\nexample, if a decent fellow falls out in October and fails to get a job\r\nsay by March, he loses his anxiety to work. The exposure, the\r\ninsufficient food, his half-starved condition, have such a deteriorating\r\neffect upon him that he becomes indifferent whether he gets work or not.\r\nHe thus passes from the unemployed state to the unemployable state. It\r\nought to be a duty of the nation to see that a man does not become\r\ndegenerate.\"\r\n\r\nIn his own unemployed days, he awoke every morning with the\r\nhalf-suppressed prayer: \"God help me to-day. Where shall I look for work\r\nto-day? Where can I earn a bob?\"\r\n\r\nActual starvation was only kept away by occasional help from his own\r\nand his wife's people and by the few shillings out-of-work pay which his\r\nTrade Union allowed him every week. Even in those days he was never so\r\nhard up as not to be ready to help others in greater privation. He was\r\nout one morning when he met a man whom he knew slightly near his own\r\nhouse. He could see that he looked ill and that he wanted to speak. So\r\nhe went up to him and said:\r\n\r\n\"Well, mate, what's amiss?\"\r\n\r\nWith tears in his eyes the man told his tale--his tale of starvation. He\r\nwas afraid or ashamed to ask for relief, and there had been no food in\r\nhis house for over twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nCrooks told the man to go home, promising to come to him presently. He\r\nhimself went back to his own home and told his wife.\r\n\r\n\"Let's see what we've got,\" she said.\r\n\r\nAll she found was a portion of a packet of cocoa and a loaf of bread.\r\nShe made a large jug of cocoa and gave her out-of-work husband that and\r\nthe loaf to take round to the other man's family.\r\n\r\n\"It's all we have in the house,\" she said; \"but we've had our breakfast,\r\nand they haven't.\"\r\n\r\nWork came at last in an unexpected way. He was returning home after\r\nanother empty day when he hailed a carman and asked for a lift.\r\n\r\n\"All right, mate, jump up,\" was the response.\r\n\r\nAs they sat chatting side by side, the carman learnt that his companion\r\nwas seeking work.\r\n\r\n\"What's yer trade?\" he inquired.\r\n\r\n\"A cooper.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, the guv'nor wants a cooper.\"\r\n\r\nSo instead of dropping off at Poplar, Crooks accompanied the carman to\r\nthe works, and he who had tramped the country and London so long in\r\nsearch of a job was at last driven triumphantly to work in a conveyance,\r\n\"like a Lord Mayor or a judge,\" as he afterwards described it.\r\n\r\nOn the first pay day, glad at heart, he was about to start for home. The\r\nmen stopped him.\r\n\r\n\"We always go to 'The Railway Tavern' on Saturdays. A decent chap keeps\r\nthe 'Railway.' Come and join us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Won't the missus let you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, she won't.\"\r\n\r\nThroughout the next week he was mercilessly \"chipped\" in the workshop\r\nand referred to as the man whose missus was waiting for him at the other\r\nend. At the close of the next week he was asked after pay-time--\r\n\r\n\"Did the missus meet you last week?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and she'll meet me this week too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come along, old chap, no kid, have a parting glass.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I can part without the glass.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of the third week a fellow-workman whispered: \"What time are\r\nyou going home, Will?\"\r\n\r\n\"Same time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me leave with you, will you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. Your missus been at you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; the fact is, Will, I stayed drinking down here until I'd blown\r\neight bob last week. It meant my two little girls had to go without\r\ntheir promised pairs of new boots.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Jim; I'll give you a whistle when it's time to go.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of six weeks the \"Railway\" was without a customer from that\r\nshop.\r\n\r\nThat work was a stepping-stone to another and a better job at\r\nWandsworth. His new employer urged him to leave Poplar and take a house\r\nnear the works.\r\n\r\n\"But suppose you pay me off when the busy time passes?\" said Crooks.\r\n\r\n\"I shan't do that,\" was the answer. \"I like your work too well.\"\r\n\r\nThe day came when Crooks was offered work nearer Poplar. When he handed\r\nin his notice the Wandsworth employer became wrathful.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, I'll come back here when I'm out of work again,\" said\r\nCrooks good-naturedly.\r\n\r\n\"Will you? I can promise you there'll be no more work for you here.\r\nLeaving me like this!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, there will. You haven't kept me on for love, you know. I like\r\nyou, and I'll come here for another job directly I'm out of work again.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not to be. Crooks was never out of work again in his life.\r\n\r\nYears later he found himself sitting next to his old Wandsworth employer\r\nat a public dinner.\r\n\r\n\"You never came back to claim that job,\" said the good-natured old man.\r\n\r\n\"I will when I'm out of work--as I promised.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! you don't know how often I wished you would come back. You may\r\nhave talked to the men a good deal about the rights of Labour, but I\r\nnever knew the rights of employers to be observed so honourably. You\r\nseemed to keep the men more sober and the work up to a higher level of\r\nefficiency than I had ever known before. That's why I wanted you to come\r\nand live near, thinking to make sure of you. That's why I was so angry\r\nwhen you handed in your notice.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE COLLEGE AT THE DOCK GATES\r\n\r\n     Commending himself to his Employers--\"Crooks's College\"--His Style\r\n     of Teaching--Specimens of his Humour--Admonitions against Drink and\r\n     Betting.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith regular work well assured, Crooks was able to give more time and\r\nstudy to public affairs and to the Labour Movement. For an unbroken\r\nperiod of ten years he held a good position in a large coopering\r\nestablishment in East London, where he was held in high esteem by men\r\nand masters alike, the latter more than once intimating to him they\r\nwould make it worth his while to remain in their service all his life.\r\n\r\nCrooks was always proud of the good standing he held in his employers'\r\neyes. He knew it was due solely to his skill as a workman, for it\r\ncertainly did not tell in his favour that he was beginning to be known\r\nmore widely than ever as a Labour agitator. This, as a term of derision,\r\nused to be applied to all Labour leaders in the 'eighties and long\r\nafterwards. Certain writers and speakers who wished to be particularly\r\nderisive would refer to them as paid agitators. Even to this day an\r\noccasional echo of the cry reaches the ears. The offenders belong to the\r\nsame school as the lady who withdrew her money from the bank after the\r\nGeneral Election of 1906 because so many Labour members had been\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\nIt was during these years of regular work that Crooks founded his famous\r\nCollege. He began a series of Sunday morning Labour meetings outside the\r\nEast India Dock Gates, which have been continued ever since. The place\r\nin association with these Sunday meetings came to be known among Poplar\r\nworkmen as Crooks's College.\r\n\r\nMany a useful lesson has he driven home to his working class audiences\r\nat his College at the Dock Gates. He generally leads off with some\r\nlittle humorous fancy.\r\n\r\n\"If you fellows only have a quid a week, don't despise your share in the\r\ncountry's government. You needn't go the length of the Cockney taxpayer\r\nwho rowed out to a man-o'-war at Portsmouth.\r\n\r\n\"'Ship ahoy!' he shouts. 'Ship ahoy!'\r\n\r\n\"At last he makes someone hear.\r\n\r\n\"'Is the captain aboard?' says he.\r\n\r\n\"'What d'yer want with the captain?' asks a bluejacket.\r\n\r\n\"'Feller,' says the taxpayer, big-like, 'just tell your captain that one\r\nof the owners of this 'ere ship wants to come aboard, and look slippy\r\nabout it.'\r\n\r\n\"The captain invites him on the deck, and he goes round the ship\r\nsniffing at this and complaining about that until the ship's carpenter\r\ngets riled.\r\n\r\n\"'Don't you know that I have a share in this ship, feller?' says the\r\ntaxpayer.\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, have yer?' says the carpenter, handing him a chip. 'You just take\r\nyour share then, and get over the side double quick, or I shall be under\r\nthe necessity of showing you the way.'\"\r\n\r\nWhen the East End was suffering from one of the water famines that used\r\nto be fairly common before the supply was taken over by a public\r\nauthority, he never tired of calling the attention of his Dock Gate\r\nmeetings to the fact that the company went on charging the same rates,\r\nwhether there was water or not.\r\n\r\n\"When I got home last night, my wife said, 'Will, the water's come on at\r\nlast; but just look at it--it's not fit to drink!' So I went to the tap\r\nand saw a lot of little things swimming about in the water. The wife was\r\nalarmed, and asked what we should do. 'My dear,' I replied, 'for\r\ngoodness sake don't say anything about it to anybody. If this gets to\r\nthe ears of the company they might charge us for the fish as well as for\r\nthe water.'\"\r\n\r\nNever was instruction at college imparted with so many human touches and\r\nhumorous sallies. He noticed that many of the men slunk away when the\r\npublic-houses opened. He made it a practice to commence his own address\r\na few minutes before the public-houses threw open their doors. In this\r\nway he kept most of the men about him. The waverers among them were\r\nshamed into staying by little thrusts like these:--\r\n\r\n\"Some of you chaps imagine you can only be men by taking the gargle. If\r\nyou could see yourselves sometimes after you've been indulging you\r\nwould jolly soon change your opinion. Perhaps you've heard of the man\r\nwho asked for a ticket at the railway junction.\r\n\r\n\"'What station?' asked the booking clerk.\r\n\r\n\"'What stations have you got?' he stammered, clinging to the ledge for\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n\"But even that chap was not so bad as the railway guard who went home a\r\nbit elevated. He saw the cat lying on the hearthrug, and chucked it in\r\nthe oven, slamming the door and yelling, 'Take yer seats for\r\nNottingham.'\r\n\r\n\"I've heard men say they only take it because the doctor orders it. One\r\nof these chaps was caught having secret nips of whiskey. 'Bless yer\r\nheart!' he says. 'Don't yer know I has ter take it for me health? I\r\nsuffers wiv tape worms.'\r\n\r\n\"One of the chief reasons some of you chaps booze is because you are too\r\nsociable-like in standing treat. A rattling boozer was once screwed up\r\nto the point of signing the pledge. He writes his name, puts his hand in\r\nhis pocket, and asks how much?\r\n\r\n\"'Nothing to pay,' says the young lady, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"'What? Nothing to pay?' he repeats in amazement. 'Do I get it for\r\nnothing? Do you mean to say that I, a working man, am offered something\r\nfor nothing?'\r\n\r\n\"'Nothing to pay,' repeats the young lady.\r\n\r\n\"'Well, 'pon my honour, this is the first time I've ever got anything\r\nfor nothing. Come and have a drink.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Some of you fellows who live on the Isle of Dogs have seen the\r\nallotment system started there. I asked one of the publicans of the\r\nneighbourhood why he complained about the allotments. 'Why,' said he,\r\n'the men used to come in and have a gargle on Saturday afternoons, but\r\nnow they go and dig clay.'\r\n\r\n\"But ask the men's wives what they say about the allotments, and you\r\nwill hear a different story. The men now have time not only to cultivate\r\ntheir plots, but to look after their families.\r\n\r\n\"How many of our poor women who give way to drink can trace their\r\ndescent to the neglect of the men who married them. It may be hard to be\r\nburdened with a drunken wife, but often enough a good deal of the fault\r\nis on the side of the husband because of his early neglect. He should\r\nhave strengthened her. He should have shared her sorrows as well as her\r\njoys. We ought not to leave a woman to bear all her own burdens. Many a\r\nyoung wife breaks down because of early neglect at a time when she ought\r\nto be built up, when it would be real manliness on the husband's part to\r\nput up with a little trouble for her sake.\r\n\r\n\"Some of you giggle when you see a man nursing a baby in long clothes.\r\nWhat is there to giggle at? I carried a baby in long clothes up the\r\nstairs of Shadwell Station the other day, because I saw it was too much\r\nfor the poor mother who was struggling along.\r\n\r\n\"'Here,' I said, 'hand it over; I'm used to that sort of job.'\r\n\r\n\"My wife heard of it before I got home, and she said to those who told\r\nher, 'Well, if the woman didn't thank him, I shall when he comes home.'\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you thought I looked a fool clambering up the stairs with a\r\nbaby in long clothes. I don't think so. I satisfied myself by doing what\r\nevidently wanted doing.\"\r\n\r\nHe hurried away from his college by the Dock Gates one Sunday morning to\r\nkeep an appointment to address the Isle of Dogs Progressive Club. He\r\nfound less than a dozen men in the lecture hall, while the bar and the\r\nbilliard room were crowded. He walked out without a word and sat down in\r\nthe club garden.\r\n\r\n\"This is all right. I'm enjoying myself perfectly here,\" he told the\r\nbewildered secretary. \"If they prefer to play at billiards and to drink\r\nbeer, let them. I am quite content to enjoy this garden.\"\r\n\r\nIn ten minutes time not a man remained in the bar or billiard room. The\r\nlecture hall was filled.\r\n\r\n\"We deserve your reproach, Will,\" shouted someone from the audience when\r\nat last he stepped on to the platform.\r\n\r\nIf he was severe on drink he was more severe on betting.\r\n\r\n\"Many a man here,\" he told one of his Sunday morning audiences at the\r\nDock Gates, \"can tell me the pedigree of half-a-dozen race-horses. It\r\nshows you can think if you like. But that kind of thinking is what I\r\ncall thinking off-side.\"\r\n\r\nCrooks had a hundred happy illustrations for urging upon his\r\nworking-class hearers the duty of citizenship and co-operation.\r\n\r\n\"We chaps are like the old lady's cow that gave a good pail of milk\r\nregular, but often kicked it over. We have built up trade unions and\r\nfriendly societies and co-operative societies that stand for the best\r\nworking class organisations in the world. But we have a weakness for\r\nkicking the pail over. How? Because we are constantly spoiling our own\r\ngood work by allowing other classes to do all the governing of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\"It reminds me of a group of boys I saw coming home from a football\r\nmatch.\r\n\r\n\"'How did yer get on?' they were asked by other lads in the street.\r\n\r\n\"'Won.'\r\n\r\n\"'How many?'\r\n\r\n\"'Seven to nothing.'\r\n\r\n\"'Been playing a blind school?'\"\r\n\r\nAnd then Crooks would go on: \"Well, we workers have been the blind\r\nschool, and we have been allowing other classes to score goals against\r\nus all the time. If we haven't been blind we've certainly been\r\nblindfold. Tear the bandage off your eyes. Be men.\"\r\n\r\nBehind all his banter there was a serious message in all his Sunday\r\nmorning addresses.\r\n\r\n\"Labour may be the new force by which God is going to help forward the\r\nregeneration of the world,\" he told his hearers. \"Heaven knows we need a\r\nlittle more earnestness in our national life to-day, and if the\r\nbest-born cannot give it, the so-called base-born may. We common people\r\nhave done it before. Who knows but what it is God's will that we should\r\ndo it again? We can all afford to laugh at that dear lady, bless her,\r\nwho could not bear the idea that some of the Apostles were fishermen,\r\nand who solemnly asked her minister whether there was not some authority\r\nfor believing that they were owners of smacks.\r\n\r\n\"We working men are gaining power. Let us see that we also gain\r\nknowledge to use the power, not to abuse it. Parliament is supposed to\r\nprotect the weak against the strong. It doesn't pan out like that. After\r\nall these years of popular education, isn't it about time we taught the\r\ndialectical champions in the House of Commons that the people are the\r\ncreators of Parliament, and that we demand as its creators that\r\nParliament should be at the service of the people and all the people,\r\ninstead of at the service of the powerful and the wealthy?\r\n\r\n\"But don't think that Parliament and municipality can do everything.\r\nThey are not going to make the world perfect. What they can do and what\r\nwe should insist on their doing is to make it easier to do right and\r\nmore difficult to do wrong. They can deal with those 'who turn aside the\r\nneedy from judgment and take away the right of the poor of My people,'\r\nbut they cannot make good men and good women. That must depend upon\r\nourselves.\"\r\n\r\nThat College at the Dock Gates can point to some notable achievements.\r\nThe Blackwall Tunnel, which has its entrance at the very spot where the\r\nmeetings take place, was one of the earliest things the College agitated\r\nfor. Between the dock wall and the tunnel is a large municipal gymnasium\r\nand recreation ground, the scheme for which was first unfolded by Crooks\r\nat the College, when the ground was a waste and the children were\r\nwithout play-places.\r\n\r\nCrooks's College began the campaign for a free library. The\r\nwell-equipped public library that now stands in the High Street was its\r\nfirst achievement. The College founded the Poplar Labour League, which\r\nfirst introduced Crooks to public life. Crooks's College first created\r\nthe demand for a technical institute for Poplar. The institute is now an\r\naccomplished fact, comprising the best municipal school of marine\r\nengineering in the country. Crooks's College started the campaign for\r\nthe footway tunnel under the Thames between the Isle of Dogs and\r\nGreenwich, which now serves the daily convenience of thousands of\r\nwork-people. Crooks's College began that policy of humane treatment of\r\nworkhouse inmates which had a great deal to do with improved\r\nadministration of the Poor Law all over the country. Crooks's College\r\nwas the originator of the farm colony system in this country. Crooks's\r\nCollege stood out for the welfare of Poor Law children. Crooks's College\r\nbroke down the corrupt practices on three of the old municipal\r\nauthorities in Poplar.\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps the greatest occasion in the history of the College at the\r\nDock Gates was that Sunday morning in June, 1906, that followed the\r\nopening of the Local Government Board Inquiry into the administration of\r\nthe guardians. For the week previously the Press and the local Municipal\r\nAlliance had done their best to poison the mind of Poplar against its\r\nlong-trusted Labour man.\r\n\r\nHow would the College fare now? The attendance at the Dock Gates that\r\nmorning was one of the largest on record. Thousands of ratepayers were\r\nthere, and when Crooks walked through their ranks to the little portable\r\nrostrum he had one of the great receptions of his life. He urged them\r\nnot to be discouraged because their cause seemed to be under a cloud,\r\nbut to strengthen his hands in maintaining the integrity of public life\r\nand to possess themselves in quietness, confident that before long the\r\naccused would become the accusers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nFROM THE CHEERING MULTITUDE TO A SORROW-LADEN HOME\r\n\r\n     The Dock Strike of 1889--\"Our Dock Strike Baby\"--At the Point of\r\n     Death--Discouraging a Missioner--Before a House of Lords\r\n     Committee--Entrance upon Public Life--A Widower with Six\r\n     Children--Second Marriage.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great Dock Strike of 1889 nearly brought Crooks to his grave. Much\r\nof the brunt and burden of that famous struggle fell upon his shoulders.\r\nMonths before, he had prepared the way by his Dock Gate meetings. When\r\nat last the disorganised bands of dock and river-side labourers startled\r\nthe industrial world by standing together as one man for better\r\nconditions of work and a minimum wage of sixpence an hour, Will Crooks\r\nwas one of the half-dozen Labour Leaders who directed the campaign to\r\nits historic triumph.\r\n\r\nSeldom, while the strike lasted, did he take his clothes off. He worked\r\nat his own trade during the day and gave nearly the whole of the night\r\nto the strikers. The outdoor meetings he addressed kept him going up to\r\nmidnight. The early morning hours saw him lending a hand at the\r\norganising offices and relief stations until the dawn called him to his\r\nordinary daily work again.\r\n\r\nThere were times when he gave both day and night to the dockers,\r\npreferring to lose time at his own work rather than miss an opportunity\r\nof lending a hand to his less fortunate fellows. Sometimes he would\r\naccompany the men in their demonstrations through the City and the\r\nWest-End.\r\n\r\nThose daily marches of the dock labourers opened London's eyes. The\r\norderliness of the ragged battalions, headed by \"the man in the straw\r\nhat,\" who was afterwards to take a seat in the Cabinet--John Burns--was\r\nas impressive as their numbers. They were forbidden to use bands of\r\nmusic in the City streets, so the men conceived the ingenious device of\r\nwhistling. It had a curious effect, some fifty thousand men whistling\r\nthe \"Marseillaise\" all the way from Aldgate to Temple Bar.\r\n\r\nWhen Crooks did get home for an hour or two in the evening it was not to\r\nrest, but to sit by the bedside of his ailing wife and tend the youngest\r\nof his children. Ill though his wife was, little though she saw of him\r\nduring the strike, she urged him from her sick bed to keep on helping\r\nthe dockers.\r\n\r\n\"Don't mind me, Will,\" she told him, when he would peep in anxiously\r\nafter many hours' absence. \"I shall be all right if you can only pull\r\nthose poor dockers through.\"\r\n\r\nHe came in one night after nearly two days' absence, having arranged to\r\nspend the whole of that evening by her bedside. She had just given birth\r\nto a son--\"our Dock Strike baby,\" as he came to be called for long\r\nafterwards, now a promising apprentice in a Thames shipbuilding yard.\r\nShe was very happy at the good news he brought of the progress of the\r\nstrike. She was happier still at the prospect of his being spared for\r\nhis first evening at home. Presently the sound of hurrying footsteps was\r\nheard in the street. Something important had happened. The men wanted\r\nWill Crooks. Would he come again?\r\n\r\nHe looked at his wife. She must decide.\r\n\r\n\"Go, Will,\" she said. \"Never let it be said your wife kept you from\r\nhelping those in need.\"\r\n\r\nThe reaction came after the victory. When the dockers in their thousands\r\nwere back at work rejoicing at having won their sixpence an hour, Crooks\r\nlay at the point of death in the London Hospital in Whitechapel Road. It\r\nwas the first time he had been ill in his life. Friends feared this\r\nfirst illness was to be his last. Not until after a struggle of thirteen\r\nweeks could he be pronounced out of danger.\r\n\r\nHe is fond of telling this incident that occurred in the hospital:--\r\n\r\n\"When I was approaching convalescence, and naturally fairly happy at the\r\nthought of soon being able to get out and return home, a missioner, as I\r\nthink he was called, came to see me as I lay in bed in the hospital. He\r\nsaid to me quite bluntly, 'Are you not a miserable sinner?'\r\n\r\n\"I said: 'No; I may be a sinner, but I am not a miserable one just now.'\r\n\r\n\"The missioner left my side in disgust, and then returned and asked to\r\nbe allowed to send me a Testament. I consented, and received in a day\r\nor two one marked in several places with red ink, apparently intended to\r\nimpress upon me what a depraved and miserable creature I was.\r\n\r\n\"The missioner called again, and questioned me as to whether I had read\r\nthe marked passages and what I thought of them.\r\n\r\n\"I told him that, as applied to me, they were not true.\r\n\r\n\"I shall never forget the look I received, and I expect I was given up\r\nas a lost man.\r\n\r\n\"A few minutes after he had left my ward a patient from another ward\r\ncame to see me, and said:--\r\n\r\n\"'I say, Twenty-five, that's the way to get rid of them.'\r\n\r\n\"I said, 'What have _you_ done to get rid of him?'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh,' he answered. 'The missioner said, \"Are you not a miserable\r\nsinner?\" and I said \"Yes\"; and then he said, \"Thank God for that,\" and\r\nwent away.'\"\r\n\r\nSoon after Crooks came out of the hospital he made his first appearance\r\nin a public capacity in Parliament. He was invited on July 11th, 1890,\r\nto give evidence before the Committee of the House of Lords on the\r\nInfant Life Insurance Bill. It was seriously argued at the time that\r\nworking class parents deliberately neglected their children for the sake\r\nof the insurance money. The Bill actually proposed that the insurance\r\nmoney be kept out of the hands of the parents altogether and paid to\r\nthe undertaker. The offending clause disappeared after Crooks's\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nThe _Evening News_, which headed its report of the day's proceedings \"A\r\nWorking Man shows the Weak Points in the New Bill,\" summarised what\r\nCrooks told the Committee thus:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     A journeyman cooper from Poplar, evidently a thoroughly\r\n     straightforward and independent working-man of more than average\r\n     intelligence and facility of expression, gave evidence yesterday\r\n     before the Committee of the House of Lords, presided over by the\r\n     Bishop of Peterborough.\r\n\r\n     He said he objected to the provision in the Bill for the payment of\r\n     insurance money to the undertaker. It was not merely to cover the\r\n     actual expenses of burial that the working man insured his child,\r\n     but to provide \"black\" and to meet other unavoidable expenses. If\r\n     insurance were abolished workmen would be obliged to fall back on\r\n     the old practice of \"Friendly Leads,\" which generally led to\r\n     drinking at public-houses.\r\n\r\n     He knew thousands of families of working people, and was perfectly\r\n     certain that there was not among them one mother lacking maternal\r\n     affection. There was no sacrifice the poor would not make for their\r\n     children, and it would be felt as a great reproach to say that a\r\n     child had not been properly cared for. In other cases bad mothers\r\n     would be bad mothers under any circumstances, and it was for the\r\n     criminal law to find them out; but if there was one bad in a\r\n     thousand he did not see why nine hundred and ninety-nine\r\n     respectable persons should be punished.\r\n\r\n     To stop child insurance, witness said in reply to Lord Norton,\r\n     would punish honest parents and do no good whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that the working people of Poplar began to urge\r\nhim to go into public life. They elected him a member of the Poplar\r\nBoard of Trustees, in regard to which he had recently unearthed a\r\nnotorious scandal. Then he was made a Library Commissioner in\r\nrecognition of the prominent part he had taken in persuading Poplar to\r\nadopt the Act. Soon afterwards he was returned as one of the two Poplar\r\nrepresentatives to the London County Council.\r\n\r\nThe cloud that had hung over his home all through the Dock Strike was to\r\ngrow yet darker. He had not been on the County Council many weeks when\r\nhis wife died. She had barely recovered from the illness that kept her\r\nbedfast during the exciting days of the strike. Then there came the\r\nthree anxious worrying months as her husband lay between life and death\r\nin the hospital. The worry wore her out, and a brave God-fearing woman\r\nof the people went down to her grave commanding her husband to work on.\r\n\r\nThus, at the commencement of his public career and while still in his\r\nthirties, Crooks found himself a widower with six children on his hands,\r\nthe youngest a baby.\r\n\r\nAmong the many letters of sympathy that poured in upon him, that which\r\ngot nearest to his heart came from one whose acquaintance he had but\r\nrecently made, who described himself as \"a fellow sufferer under a like\r\nbereavement.\" The writer was Lord Rosebery, then Chairman of the London\r\nCounty Council.\r\n\r\nAll that first year of Crooks's public life was gone through while he\r\nwas bearing heavy burdens at home. His new duties as London County\r\nCouncillor, the many urgent calls to help the Labour movement in other\r\nquarters, now that he was beginning to be known far beyond the bounds of\r\nPoplar, kept him away from home often until a late hour. All this added\r\ngreatly to his domestic cares, since he had to be both mother and father\r\nto his children. The eldest daughter, fourteen years of age, managed\r\nbravely; but many a night he turned away from addressing the cheering\r\nmultitude of a crowded, glittering hall and went to a cheerless home to\r\nfind the youngest children crying. He would help to wash them, to mend\r\ntheir clothes, and to cook for them.\r\n\r\nA year's experience convinced him that neither he nor the children could\r\ngo on in that way. His aged mother rendered all the help her growing\r\ninfirmities would allow. The old lady, with her married children's aid,\r\nnow lived in modest comfort in a little house off the High Street. There\r\nlodged with her a young nurse engaged at a neighbouring institution,\r\nwhose maiden name was Elizabeth Lake, a native of Gloucestershire.\r\nCrooks laid his case before her. She consented to become his wife and\r\nbring up his children. They were married in Poplar Parish Church in\r\n1893.\r\n\r\nThe union has been a singularly happy one. Mrs. Crooks has done more\r\nthan bring up the children. She has guided and inspired her husband in\r\nall his public life. So much so, that when some eight years later he\r\nlaid down his robes of office after a successful year as Mayor of\r\nPoplar, he stated publicly in acknowledging a presentation to himself\r\nand the Mayoress:--\r\n\r\n\"Without my wife's aid I would have been of little use in my public\r\nwork. Whenever I return home troubled or anxious, or defeated on some\r\npet scheme, I never have from my wife anything but cheering and\r\nencouraging words. She it is who has made my public life possible. She\r\nit is who deserves your thanks far more than I.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nA LABOUR MEMBER'S WAGES\r\n\r\n     The Will Crooks Wages Fund formed--The Poplar Labour\r\n     League--Crooks's Election to the London County Council--Friends\r\n     outside the Labour Movement--Money no Substitute for Personal\r\n     Service--Refusing highly-paid Posts--Offer of a House rent-free for\r\n     Life declined--Not Risen from the Ranks.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow came it that a working man like Crooks was able to give his whole\r\ntime to public work?\r\n\r\nIt was simply because his fellow workmen wished it. They went to him in\r\ndeputation in the early 'nineties, and said to him in effect:--\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Crooks. You can be more useful to us in public life than at\r\nthe workman's bench. We want you to stand for the London County Council\r\nand some of the local bodies. Give up your work and we'll raise for you\r\nfrom among ourselves an amount equal to your present wages.\"\r\n\r\nTo which Crooks replied:--\r\n\r\n\"All right, mates, since you wish it. But understand! as soon as you\r\ntire of me, no grumbling behind my back. Come forward and say so\r\nplainly, and I'll go back to the bench at once.\"\r\n\r\nSo the Will Crooks Wages Fund was formed by the Poplar Labour League.\r\nThe first treasurer was the Rev. H. A. Kennedy, of All Hallows',\r\nBlackwall. Afterwards the then Rector of Poplar (Dr. Chandler) was\r\ninvited by the working men to become treasurer of the fund, and he held\r\nthe office until called away to a Colonial bishopric.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how the Poplar Labour League came into being. It was one of\r\nthe first achievements of Crooks's College by the Dock Gates. Originally\r\nit was named the Poplar Labour Election Committee. Its first executive\r\nconsisted of the Rev. H. A. Kennedy and local representatives of the\r\nLondon Trades Council, the Engine Drivers' and Firemen's Union, the\r\nWatermen's Society, the Dockers' Union, the Philanthropic Coopers'\r\nSociety, the East London Plumbers' Union, the Federated Trade and Labour\r\nUnions, and the Gasworkers' Union.\r\n\r\nThe League was one of the pioneers of Labour Representation in this\r\ncountry. Long before the British Labour Party organised the present\r\nsystem of paying its Members of Parliament, this little League in Poplar\r\nfor an unbroken period of a dozen years had shown how men from the ranks\r\nof Labour could be maintained in public life. The League had a motto:\r\n\"The aim of every workman, whatever his task, whether he labours with\r\naxe, chisel, or lathe, loom or last, hammer or pen, hands or head,\r\nshould be the ideal, the best, the perfect.\"\r\n\r\nThe League was successful from the start. Its earliest effort was put\r\nforth at the London County Council election of 1892. The result of that\r\neffort can be judged from the following remarks in the League's first\r\nannual report:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     The return of Will Crooks to the London County Council marks an\r\n     epoch in the life of industrial Poplar.\r\n\r\n     From time immemorial this hive of industry has been represented by\r\n     employers of labour and wealthy capitalists. Their record is now\r\n     broken. Labour has awakened to a sense of its duty. We hope the\r\n     awakening will be permanent, and that worthy representatives may be\r\n     found to fill the vacancies on the various administrative and\r\n     legislative bodies.\r\n\r\n     We suggest to all working men's societies that wherever and\r\n     whenever it is possible they should subscribe to the Labour\r\n     Member's Wages Fund, for be it remembered that our Member is a\r\n     representative of all classes and not of one particular individual\r\n     class; and so long as he retains our confidence it is our duty to\r\n     support him to our utmost ability.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe response of the trade societies and workmen and friends generally\r\nwas such that within a few months the League by a unanimous vote decided\r\nto raise the Labour Member's wages from £3 to £3 10s. a week to meet his\r\ntravelling expenses. For the first seven or eight years of his public\r\nlife that was absolutely the only source of Crooks's income.\r\n\r\nThe League remained faithful to its early pledge all the time. Through\r\ngood and ill report, through all the changes and dissensions which such\r\nan organisation was bound to cause, the League never once faltered in\r\nits support of Crooks. Regularly at its annual meetings the League\r\npassed a vote of thanks to \"our representative on the L.C.C. for his\r\nuntiring devotion to Labour's cause and his perseverance in initiating\r\nsocial reform so beneficial to the working classes. They further desire\r\nto record their perfect confidence in him and congratulate him on the\r\nsuccess of his work.\"\r\n\r\nMany trade societies other than those on the original list became\r\nsubscribers to the Wages Fund through their local branches. Among them\r\nwere the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, the Stevedores' Labour\r\nProtection League, the London Saddle and Harness Makers' Society, the\r\nPostmen's Federation, the London Carmen's Trade Union, the Friendly\r\nSociety of Ironfounders, the Municipal Employees' Association, and the\r\nAmalgamated Society of Railway Servants.\r\n\r\nCertain admirers of Crooks outside the Labour Movement also sent\r\nsubscriptions to the League for the Wages Fund. Canon and Mrs. Barnett\r\nand Dr. Clifford were occasional subscribers; so were Mrs. Bernard Shaw,\r\nMr. Cyril Jackson, Mrs. Ruth Homan, Mr. G. W. E. Russell, Mr. Sidney\r\nWebb, Sir Melville Beachcroft, Canon Scott Holland, Mr. Fred Butler, the\r\neditors of two or three London newspapers, and both Conservative and\r\nLiberal Members of Parliament.\r\n\r\nOccasionally working men in distant parts of the country who had heard\r\nCrooks speak or watched his public work would send in their mite,\r\ngenerally anonymously. One such contribution, sent during the Woolwich\r\nby-election, consisted of four penny stamps, stuck on a torn piece of\r\ndirty paper, on which were written the words:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Will you please except four stamps toward the expens of will\r\n     Crooks election and may god bless him in being successful in\r\n     winning the seat for Labour\r\n\r\n     from a working man.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat was all. Crooks keeps the stamps and the note to this day.\r\n\r\nThis may be the proper place to make public another fact bearing on his\r\nfinancial position. Many people have sent cheques to him direct, some of\r\nthese marked for his own personal use, some for helping the poor as he\r\nthought best, others containing nothing beyond a brief note without name\r\nor address like the following:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     This is sent by a well-wisher, who believes that you are an honest,\r\n     straightforward fellow with a large heart for those less fortunate\r\n     than yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery sum received in this way Crooks has given to the poor. He has\r\nneither taken a penny for his own personal use nor allowed a penny to\r\npass into the coffers of the Labour League. In one distressful winter\r\nover £300 was thus sent to him and his wife. With the co-operation of a\r\nlocal committee, the whole of this sum was spent in employing\r\nout-of-work women and girls in making garments for their needy\r\nneighbours. By these means dozens of families were saved from the\r\nworkhouse.\r\n\r\nCrooks discourages those who give money only. \"Give part of yourself\r\nrather than part of your wealth,\" he tells them.\r\n\r\nHe has little sympathy with people who give money and then run away. A\r\nperson once called at his house during a bad winter and offered him\r\n£500.\r\n\r\n\"I am anxious about the poor people, Mr. Crooks,\" said the visitor, \"so\r\nI've brought down this money for you to help them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you?\" was the response. \"But what are _you_ going to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm going to the south of France. I cannot bear England in the\r\nwinter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I advise you to take the five hundred pounds with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you refuse it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely. It is cowardly for a man like you to offer five hundred\r\npounds and then run away. You ought to do more than give it; you ought\r\nto spend it. Come down and see that the proper people get it. It is not\r\nso hard to raise five hundred pounds for the poor as it is to distribute\r\nit properly among the poor.\"\r\n\r\nThe Labour League did more than send Crooks to the London County\r\nCouncil. It secured representation on the local Poor Law and municipal\r\nbodies. It promoted social life as well as public life among the working\r\nclasses of Poplar. By entertainments, lectures, and excursions it\r\ncarried brightness and pleasure into the lives of the workmen, their\r\nwives, and children. At Christmas time it acted as a kind of Santa Claus\r\nto the poorest children of the district. It established a Loan and\r\nThrift Society, which soon had an annual turnover of £2,000. Throughout\r\nit all the League never for a moment deserted its Labour Member.\r\n\r\nCrooks in his turn remained faithful to the League in face of several\r\nalluring offers. The one that tempted him most came from his own trade.\r\nBefore he quitted the workshop for public life a future managership had\r\nbeen hinted at. He had not been on the County Council more than a few\r\nmonths when a vacancy in his former workshop occurred. At once he was\r\napproached and urged to give up the L.C.C.\r\n\r\nThe post offered him carried with it a salary of £500. He had six\r\nchildren to bring up. There was the uncertainty as to the Labour League\r\nbeing able to keep up the Wages Fund. He pondered over the matter\r\ncarefully. His decision changed the current of his life. A manager, no\r\nmatter how sympathetic, could not have remained long in the Labour\r\nMovement. Besides, in this case there were hints of a future\r\npartnership. Then it was that he decided calmly and deliberately to give\r\nhis life not to money-making, but to the service of the people. He\r\ndeliberately chose to remain a poor man in the service of poor men.\r\nHaving been made to bear so much of the care of this world, he\r\ndetermined that he would know nothing of the deceitfulness of riches.\r\n\r\nNothing has ever shaken him from that decision. From various quarters\r\nsince then other good offers have come his way. One of them, a\r\nGovernment post, must be regarded as a singular tribute to his worth,\r\nsince the offer came from a Conservative Cabinet Minister.\r\n\r\nThe manager of a large firm engaged in carrying out public works to the\r\nvalue of over a million sterling, gave me at the time a frank opinion of\r\nCrooks from the employers' standpoint.\r\n\r\n\"I can't help liking that chap Crooks. But it's a pity he's on what I\r\ncall the wrong side. He's been negotiating with our firm until he has\r\ncompelled us to pay our men several thousand pounds a year extra in\r\nwages. And a lot of thanks they give him for it! I overhear them\r\nsometimes talking at work. They say he wouldn't have got them more money\r\nif he hadn't been getting something out of it himself. Now if Crooks\r\nwould only place his ability on the employers' side he could earn a\r\nthousand a year easily.\"\r\n\r\nFor ten years after he entered public life Crooks was content with the\r\nsame five-roomed house in Northumberland Street where the deputation of\r\nworking men found him when they came to invite him to stand for the\r\nCounty Council. When he did move it was into a neighbouring street,\r\nGough Street, where the upgrown family had the advantage of an\r\nadditional room. That remains his home to this day.\r\n\r\nOne of his ardent admirers in Poplar, a well-to-do man, on learning he\r\nwas moving from Northumberland Street, offered him a house of his own\r\nrent free. It was a large and pleasant house in East India Dock Road,\r\nboasting a garden front and back. The owner implored him to take it for\r\nthe rest of his life, \"as a small tribute from one who appreciates the\r\nsplendid public services you have rendered to Poplar.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would never do for me to live in such a house,\" was Crooks's reply\r\nin thanking the well-wisher. \"My friends among the working people would\r\nfear I was deserting their class, and would not come to me as freely as\r\nthey come now. My enemies would say, 'Look at that fellow Crooks; he's\r\nmaking his pile out of us.' A Labour man like me must leave no opening\r\nfor his enemies.\"\r\n\r\nWe have seen, then, that the only source of Crooks's income during the\r\nfirst years of his public life was the £3 10s. a week paid by the Poplar\r\nLabour League. After six or seven years this salary was increased to £4\r\nin view of his greatly widened sphere of public service. This payment\r\nwas stopped in 1903, when Crooks joined the official Labour Party in the\r\nHouse of Commons. Then he received the usual payment of £200 a year,\r\ngiven to each member of that party by the Trade Unionists of the\r\ncountry. A small additional sum has since been voted to him annually by\r\nthe Poplar League and the Woolwich Labour Representation Association to\r\nmeet the out-of-pocket expenses inseparable from a Member of\r\nParliament's life. In addition he has received an occasional fee for a\r\npublic address.\r\n\r\nLet these simple facts, then, be the answer to those people who,\r\nsurprised at the amount of public work he carries out, keep asking\r\nsuspiciously how he does it. Crooks himself never hesitates to speak\r\nout, either in public or private, as to his financial position.\r\n\r\n\"How do I do it?\" Crooks repeats to his working class audiences. \"As a\r\npioneer of paid Labour representation I have been confronted with this\r\nquestion through the whole of my public career. All well and good; but\r\nwhy is the question not put to other politicians and public men? You\r\nworking men have been the worst offenders. You never think of asking the\r\nquestion of such men seeking public positions as monopolists, food\r\nadulterators, scamping contractors, property sweaters, bogus company\r\npromoters, and others who fleece you at every turn. You never dream of\r\nasking it of young untried men fresh from the Universities, who in many\r\ncases are only after the spoils of office. You are inclined to regard\r\nall these people as gentlemen. But let a man from your own ranks offer\r\nto serve you in public life, and always there are a crowd of objectors,\r\ngenerally thickest at public-house bars, who want to know where the\r\nLabour man gets his money from? Talk about the fierce light that beats\r\nupon a throne, what is it to the fierce light turned upon a Labour\r\nrepresentative?\r\n\r\n\"How often, as I go about, do I hear of people saying sneeringly: 'Look\r\nat that fellow Crooks. Who is he? He's only one of us, who has risen\r\nfrom the ranks.' You just tell these people that Will Crooks has not\r\nrisen from the ranks; he is still in the ranks, standing four-square\r\nwith the working classes against monopoly and privilege.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nON THE LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL\r\n\r\n     The Labour Bench at the L.C.C.--Its First Party Meeting--The\r\n     Programme--Crooks's First Speech in the County Hall--The Trade\r\n     Union Wages Principle Adopted--One of the Master-builders of the\r\n     New London--Retrospect--Chairman of the Public Control\r\n     Committee--Keeping an Eye on the Coal Sack--The End of Baby-farming\r\n     in London.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Crooks entered the London County Council in 1892 he was a stranger\r\nto almost all outside the little circle of Labour men sent up from other\r\ndivisions.\r\n\r\nAs a pioneer in Labour representation in London he had more than the\r\nusual amount of suspicion and opposition to surmount. In those days a\r\nLabour representative was often subjected to fierce personal attacks\r\nboth from the class he represented and from the better-off classes whose\r\ndomains for the first time working-men were entering. His every word and\r\nact were under a double microscope. He had to be a Spartan in endurance\r\nand a saint in character.\r\n\r\n\"Imagine,\" he once said to me during his early days on the Council, at\r\nthe time when one of its members, a peer, was associated with a\r\nnotorious case in the High Court, \"imagine what an outcry there would\r\nhave been up and down the land if that Councillor, instead of belonging\r\nto the House of Lords, had been a Labour representative.\"\r\n\r\nThe Labour bench at the County Council set the standard for sound and\r\nsteady municipal administration to the Labour Party of the entire\r\ncountry. John Burns sat at one end of the bench, Will Crooks at the\r\nother. Between them sat, at different times, men like Will Steadman,\r\nsecretary of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress\r\nand M.P. for Stepney and later for Central Finsbury; J. Ramsay\r\nMacdonald, secretary of the Labour Party and M.P. for Leicester; Isaac\r\nMitchell, then secretary of the General Federation of Trade Unions; H.\r\nR. Taylor, of the Bricklayers' Society, at one time Mayor of Camberwell;\r\nC. W. Bowerman, of the London Society of Compositors and M.P. for\r\nDeptford; George Dew, of the Carpenters' and Joiners' Society and\r\nsecretary of the Workmen's Cheap Trains Association; Harry Gosling, of\r\nthe Watermen's and Lightermen's Society; and W. Sanders, of the Fabian\r\nSociety and Independent Labour Party.\r\n\r\nCrooks took the minutes of the first party meeting of the Labour Bench,\r\nand he holds the document to this day. The meeting was held at the\r\noffices of the Dockers' Union in the Mile End Road on April 26th, 1892,\r\na few weeks after the election which first made a L.C.C. Labour Party\r\npossible. A line of policy was laid down that looks quite modest to-day,\r\nnow that it has become an integral part of ordinary L.C.C.\r\nadministration. At the time it was regarded by people outside the Labour\r\nMovement as rank revolution.\r\n\r\nIn the dull and dingy room in Mile End this little band of Labour men\r\ndeclared for direct employment of labour and municipal workshops. The\r\nL.C.C. Works Department, the first of its kind in the country, was the\r\nresult. They agreed on a minimum wage of sixpence an hour for labourers\r\nand ninepence for artisans, with a maximum working week of fifty-four\r\nhours. In many L.C.C. departments higher wages were afterwards secured,\r\nand in others an eight-hour day was introduced. They demanded a system\r\nof retiring pensions for workmen as for officials. This, too, in certain\r\ndepartments soon became practical politics on the County Council.\r\n\r\nA few days later Crooks was making his first speech at the County Hall.\r\nHe took part in the debate on the Fair Wages Clause, the final form of\r\nwhich was settled on the principle he laid down. Up to the birth of the\r\nLondon County Council, which was only three years old when Crooks joined\r\nit, municipal bodies knew nothing of Fair Wages Clauses in contracts.\r\nThe London County Council set an example which has since been followed\r\nby public authorities all over the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThis triumph for Labour was not won without a keen struggle. All kinds\r\nof proposals were discussed with a view to defining a fair wage. It\r\nlooked as though the Labour Bench were in danger of losing the day, when\r\nthe situation was saved by what John Burns afterwards told Crooks was a\r\nhappy inspiration.\r\n\r\nThe County Council was about to adopt what the Labour Bench regarded as\r\nan unsatisfactory resolution. Crooks hastily wrote out an amendment\r\nwhich ultimately formed the basis of a settlement. He showed it to\r\nBurns, as leader of the Labour Party, and the latter immediately got up\r\nand moved it. The words are worth repeating, since they supplied the\r\nfoundation for a Fair Wages Clause destined to become famous:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     That all contractors be compelled to sign a declaration that they\r\n     pay the trade union rate of wages and observe the hours of labour\r\n     and conditions recognised by the London Trade Unions, and that the\r\n     hours of labour be inserted in and form part of the contract by way\r\n     of schedule, and that penalties be enforced for any breach of\r\n     agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore long this was the only proposal before the Council. The original\r\nmotion was withdrawn, while amendment after amendment directed against\r\nthe proposal Crooks had prepared was thrown out. Moderate and\r\nProgressive members got up to say that to enforce trade union wages was\r\nto fly in the face of political economy. It was this remark that drew\r\nfrom Crooks his maiden speech. How little he was known then may be\r\njudged from the fact that the _Daily Chronicle's_ report the next day\r\nreferred to him as Mr. Brooks. Thus:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Mr. Brooks said that political economy never took humanity into\r\n     account, but unless humanity was considered there could be no\r\n     justice to the worker. No contractor had ever been ruined by paying\r\n     trade union rates of wages. The best wages had always meant the\r\n     best workmen. Trade unions were anxious that the surplus labour of\r\n     the country should be employed, and they only asked the Council to\r\n     fix a minimum rate of wages. The sooner the Council employed men\r\n     direct the better. In the name of humanity and Christianity he\r\n     appealed to the Council to adopt trade union rates of wages.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day this report appeared Crooks received the following letter from\r\n\"Marxian,\" of the _Labour Leader_, his friend George Samuel:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR CROOKS,--Are you the Mr. Brooks of to-day's _Chronicle_\r\n     report? If so, permit me to congratulate you on your speech. It\r\n     struck the one true note in all the weary debate. The awakened\r\n     consciousness of man has already interfered pretty considerably\r\n     with the economic \"law of population\" and must interfere even more\r\n     drastically with the economic \"law of supply and demand.\" Both laws\r\n     are for semi-brutes and not for men. To say that supply and demand\r\n     shall settle wages is brutal. You may not be a very learned man,\r\n     friend Crooks, but at any rate you are not weighted with that false\r\n     learning which slays the heart to feed the head.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fair wages debate went on from week to week at the County Hall, not\r\nwearily, as Crooks's correspondent suggests, but with much spirit and\r\nparty feeling. Finally Lord Rosebery, as chairman, advised the Council\r\nto hold a special meeting to settle the question. Before that meeting\r\ntook place the chairman invited Crooks to discuss the matter with him\r\nwith a view to arriving at a compromise likely to commend itself to the\r\nmajority. Crooks refused to withdraw his claim for trade union wages,\r\nand after the two had had a long informal talk on the question, Lord\r\nRosebery accepted the Labour member's view.\r\n\r\nWhen the special meeting assembled the late Lord Farrer (then Sir\r\nThomas Farrer) carried an amendment to the trade union motion. By this\r\namendment the word \"London\" was deleted from the motion, and it was made\r\nto read that contractors should \"pay the trade union rate of wages and\r\nobserve the hours of labour and conditions recognised by the trade\r\nunions _in the place or places where the contract is executed_.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, then, that the principle of trade union wages as laid\r\ndown by Crooks remained intact. On this principle the L.C.C. Fair Wages\r\nClause was established. It stipulates that the \"rates of pay are to be\r\nnot less nor the hours of labour more than those recognised by\r\nassociations of employers and trade unions and in practice obtained.\" It\r\nprovides further that \"where in any trade there is no trade union, the\r\nCouncil shall fix the rates of wages and the hours of labour.\"\r\n\r\nThe Labour Councillor for Poplar was soon on the warpath again. He\r\ncalled the Council's attention to the low wages paid to some of the park\r\nattendants. He instanced the man in charge of Red Lion Square, who was\r\nreceiving no more than thirteen shillings a week.\r\n\r\n\"The man's not worth more,\" shouted a member. \"He's got a wooden leg.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but he hasn't got a wooden stomach,\" came the retort from the\r\nLabour Bench.\r\n\r\nAnd the man with the wooden leg, as well as other park attendants, had\r\ntheir wages brought up to the living standard.\r\n\r\nCrooks soon became a good all-round municipal administrator, as well as\r\na Labour representative. He had stated in his first election address:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     As a workman I should seek especially to represent the interests of\r\n     the working classes who form three-fourths of the ratepayers of\r\n     Poplar, while giving every attention to the general work of the\r\n     London County Council and to the general interests of Poplar.\r\n\r\n     I am heartily in favour of what is known as the London\r\n     programme--of Home Rule for London, as enjoyed by other\r\n     municipalities; of the relief of the present ratepayers by taxing\r\n     the owner as well as the occupier; and of the equalisation of rates\r\n     throughout London for the relief of the poorer districts.\r\n\r\n     I am in favour of municipal ownership or control of water,\r\n     tramways, markets, docks, lighting, parks, and the police.\r\n\r\n     I would support all measures which would help to raise the standard\r\n     of life for the poor, especially in the way of better housing and a\r\n     strict enforcement of the Public Health Acts.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrooks, in fact, became one of the master-builders of the New London\r\nwhich the L.C.C. created. In face of heavy opposition he was one of that\r\nstrenuous band of stalwarts who in the 'nineties raised London out of\r\nthe chaos and darkness that reigned before the County Council was called\r\ninto being, and gave the capital for the first time a sense of civic\r\nunity.\r\n\r\nIn later years the claims of Parliament turned much of his energy into\r\nother useful channels. But to this day he still remains a member of the\r\nLondon County Council, and though now so much engrossed in national\r\npolitics, he is none the less proud of his record in the service of\r\nLondon. He never looks back to the strenuous 'nineties on the County\r\nCouncil without being thankful.\r\n\r\n\"I believe we put new life into the municipal politics of the whole\r\ncountry in those days,\" he tells you. \"The London County Council showed\r\nthe people of England what great powers for good lay in the hands of\r\nmunicipalities. We became a terror to all the monopolists who had\r\nfattened on London for generations. We struck at slum-owners, ground\r\nlandlords, the music-hall offenders, food adulterators, and those who\r\nrobbed the poor by unjust weights. We swept the tramway and water\r\ncompanies out of London, and by substituting public control gave the\r\npeople better and cheaper services. We broke down the contractors' ring\r\nand started our own Works Department, the worst abused but the most\r\nsuccessful and the most daring municipal undertaking of the last quarter\r\nof a century.\r\n\r\n\"They were glorious days. That ten years' struggle between the people\r\nand the monopolists was a strife of giants. The victory we gained in\r\nLondon was a victory for progressive municipal government all over the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\"We on the Labour Bench were in the front of the battle all the time.\r\nWhile the big campaigns were going on we were not neglecting the smaller\r\nduties. We carried the County Council right into the working-man's home.\r\nWe not only protected poor tenants from house-spoilers and extortionate\r\nwater companies, we gave a helping hand to the housewife. We saw that\r\nthe coal sacks were of proper size, that the lamp oil was good, the\r\ndustbin emptied regularly, that the bakers' bread was of proper weight,\r\nthat the milk came from wholesome dairies and healthy cows, that the\r\ncoster in the street and the tradesman in the shop gave good weight in\r\neverything they sold.\"\r\n\r\nFor several years Crooks was a member and at one time chairman of the\r\nPublic Control Committee of the London County Council. It was this\r\ncommittee that looked after these numerous small duties bearing so\r\nimportant a relation to the working-man's home. Crooks kept a keen eye\r\non the coal sack. It was found that all over London coal was being\r\ndelivered in sacks too small to hold the prescribed weight. There was\r\nconsternation among the offending dealers when the County Council began\r\nto pounce down upon them.\r\n\r\nIn reference to this matter Crooks tells a quaint story. During one of\r\nthe L.C.C. elections he heard a couple of lads in heated altercation.\r\n\r\n\"The County Council! Don't you talk to me about them people,\" one of\r\nthem cried. \"They oughter be all at the bottom of the sea. They nearly\r\nruined my pore ole dad.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's bad. How was it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Afore the County Council was heard of a two-hundredweight sack didn't\r\nhave to be no bigger 'n that\"--holding his hand on a level with his\r\nchest--\"but now they have to be this size\"--and his hand went above his\r\nhead. \"Nearly ruined the pore ole man,\" he added. \"He ain't got over it\r\nyet.\"\r\n\r\nThe Public Control Committee did more than ensure proper weight; it saw\r\nto it that dealers did not deliver coal inferior in quality to that\r\ndescribed on the ticket. It recovered damages from a merchant who\r\nmisrepresented the quality of his coals. When the case was reported to\r\nthe L.C.C. one of the older members, to whom this kind of thing was\r\nwholly a new exercise of public duty, declared that he supposed the\r\nCouncil would next be insisting that the workman's Sunday joint\r\nconsisted of nothing but good meat.\r\n\r\n\"And why not?\" asked Crooks, who followed him in the debate. \"If the man\r\npays for fresh meat and receives bad meat, and is too poor to take\r\naction himself, it is the duty of the public authority to see that he\r\ngets justice.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no more ardent believer than Crooks in Ruskin's dictum that\r\nwhen a people apologises for its pitiful criminalities and endures its\r\nfalse weights and its adulterated food, the end is not far off.\r\n\r\nOne at least of the pitiful criminalities of our modern\r\ncivilisation--baby-farming--was dealt a blow during his chairmanship of\r\nthe Public Control Committee from which it is not likely ever to\r\nrecover. He represented the L.C.C. before the Committee of the House of\r\nCommons which considered the Infant Life Protection Bill promoted by the\r\nCouncil. That was before his own Parliamentary career began. Day after\r\nday the Labour man strove with barristers and Members of Parliament in\r\nthe Commons Committee Room to safeguard infants of misfortune from\r\ncruelty and neglect. His advocacy prevailed. The Bill was passed.\r\nBaby-farming as then existing in London came to an end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTWO OF HIS MONUMENTS\r\n\r\n     Testimony from Sir John McDougall and Lord Welby--Declining the\r\n     Vice-chairmanship of the L.C.C.--How Crooks Lost His Overcoat--Work\r\n     on the Technical Education Board--The Blackwall Tunnel--Chairman of\r\n     the Bridges Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the first, Crooks has shared the representation of Poplar on the\r\nLondon County Council with Sir John McDougall. The retired merchant was\r\nat the top of the poll in 1892, while the Labour man found himself\r\nelected as the second member with a thousand majority over the two\r\nModerate candidates. At every L.C.C. election since Crooks has headed\r\nthe poll.\r\n\r\nTwo such men, of course, differ in their public policy widely. This\r\nnotwithstanding, Sir John paid his Labour colleague a striking tribute\r\nduring the parliamentary by-election in Woolwich. Sir John was Chairman\r\nof the London County Council at the time. This is what he wrote to the\r\nWoolwich electors a few days before the poll:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Mr. Crooks has been my colleague on the London County Council for\r\n     the last twelve years, and during the whole of that time he has\r\n     worked with great zeal and ability for the good of London.... His\r\n     zeal is great, and his wisdom is as great as his zeal. I doubt\r\n     whether anyone in London has done so much as he in all the\r\n     measures which tend to the uplifting and the good of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Welby, another of his colleagues on the County Council, seized the\r\nsame opportunity to tell the electors what he thought of their Labour\r\ncandidate. The two opinions, coming from men who had often opposed his\r\npolicy, and whose walks of life lay so widely apart from his own, form\r\nno small tribute to the worth of his municipal work. Said Lord Welby:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Mr. Crooks's knowledge, his experience, his courage, his readiness\r\n     of humour, his good temper, and, above all, his devotion to the\r\n     work he has undertaken have made him one of the most useful, as\r\n     well as one of the most popular, members of the London County\r\n     Council.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis devotion was shown by his attendance. For thirteen years in\r\nsuccession he never missed a single Council meeting. Until Parliament\r\nbegan to claim his time his record of attendance every year, both at\r\nCouncil and Committee meetings, stood among the half-dozen highest.\r\n\r\nAfter such a long unbroken service, it was bitter to be kept at home by\r\nan illness one Tuesday, the day the L.C.C. meets. Only one other\r\ncouncillor--Sir William Collins--had kept pace with him during those\r\nthirteen years. Crooks wrote to his friendly rival from a sick bed:--\r\n\r\n\"To-day you go ahead in this long and pleasant competition between us. I\r\ncannot help thinking that after all it is a case of the survival of the\r\nfittest, for I cannot leave my room.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hate to win under such conditions,\" said Sir William in his cheering\r\nreply.\r\n\r\nAt one time the Progressive party proposed to nominate him as\r\nvice-chairman, a position entitling the holder to the L.C.C.\r\nchairmanship in the year following. The honour was declined. He believed\r\nhe could be more useful as an independent member.\r\n\r\nSo the sequel proved. As a member of the Parks Committee he never\r\nwearied in working for more open spaces and children's play-places in\r\nthe poorer parts of London. It had long been a grievance to the working\r\nclasses of London that nearly all the parks lay in the West End and the\r\nsuburbs. Since the poor districts were now too thickly covered with\r\nhouses ever to permit of spacious parks being provided in their midst,\r\nCrooks was one of the most earnest in pleading that the Council should\r\nmake amends by rescuing every vacant plot of land that remained and\r\nconverting it into a recreation ground, no matter how small.\r\n\r\nHis strenuous plea secured for the East-End alone three splendid open\r\nspaces. These are the Bromley Recreation Ground, the Tunnel Gardens at\r\nPoplar, and the Island Gardens that take their name from the Isle of\r\nDogs. To visit any one of these, and see therein children playing and\r\ntired people finding rest, is to feel deeply what a benign influence has\r\nfallen over these poor neighbourhoods.\r\n\r\nCrooks obtained this recreation ground for Bromley at the cost of his\r\novercoat. The open space was formed out of something like a morass by\r\nthe banks of the Lea. It lay hidden away in that labyrinth of sterile\r\nstreets stretching southwards from Bow Bridge to the spot where the\r\nlesser river loses itself in the Thames.\r\n\r\nHe had persuaded a party of his County Council colleagues to go with him\r\nto the neighbourhood. They all left their overcoats in the private\r\nomnibus that took them down from the County Hall, while he showed them\r\nover the unwholesome little waste, as it then was, and pointed out its\r\npossibilities as a recreation ground. When they returned they learnt\r\nthat one of the overcoats had been stolen.\r\n\r\n\"I see it's not mine,\" said Lord Monkswell, pointing to his astrachan.\r\n\r\n\"Nor mine,\" added the Hon. Lionel Holland, then M.P. for the division,\r\nas he picked up one lined with fur.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Crooks; \"people about here daren't wear overcoats like those.\r\nIf there's one missing, it's bound to be mine worse luck.\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed at the loss then and many times afterwards, though he had a\r\nprivate reason for lamenting it; it was a recent gift from half a dozen\r\nworking-men admirers. He laughed because he found he was able to make\r\nuse of the incident in his long agitation on the L.C.C. to get the waste\r\nreclaimed.\r\n\r\nWhenever his colleagues inquired where was this mysterious outlandish\r\nplace he was so anxious to convert into a recreation ground, he would\r\nmake reply:--\r\n\r\n\"It's the place where they preferred my coat to Lord Monkswell's.\"\r\n\r\nIt came to be so well known on the County Council as the place where\r\nCrooks lost his overcoat, that when finally he got a definite proposal\r\nto buy the ground brought forward there was nothing but a good-natured\r\nacquiescence from every member.\r\n\r\nOn the formation of the L.C.C. Technical Education Board, he pleaded the\r\ncause of good craftsmanship with some effect. He carried a resolution\r\nconferring special facilities for technical instruction upon\r\nworking-class districts.\r\n\r\nLong after he retired from the Board he received from a working-man's\r\nson a little proof of the practical results of his efforts. It came in\r\nthe following letter:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     You will probably remember how some years ago you pleaded my case\r\n     on the L.C.C., and how, through your influence, I was enabled to\r\n     complete my studies in naval architecture at Greenwich College.\r\n\r\n     I am sure you will be glad to know that I have now passed my final\r\n     examination and have just been admitted a member of the Royal Corps\r\n     of Naval Constructors. My official appointment is that of Assistant\r\n     Constructor in one of the principal Government Dockyards, where I\r\n     have been on probation for the last twelve months or more. The\r\n     final examinations were held last July in London and occupied more\r\n     than three weeks, with an exam, almost daily.\r\n\r\n     I feel that I owe you a debt of gratitude for pleading my cause at\r\n     the time. My father had spent his all on me while I was at the\r\n     college, and he being a toolsmith with seven children, you can well\r\n     understand that what he had by him he could ill afford on me.\r\n\r\n     My father and the others of the family desire to join with me in\r\n     this letter of thanks and gratitude to you.\r\n\r\n\r\nMention has already been made of how Crooks and the Poplar Labour League\r\noriginated at the Dock Gate meetings the scheme for a technical\r\ninstitute for his native borough. So many times was this project delayed\r\nthat he often told his Poplar audiences he feared he would go down to\r\nposterity as the man who talked of an institute that never came. It was\r\nnot until the early part of 1906 that the institute was opened. There is\r\na reference to it in the annual report of the Poplar Labour League for\r\nthat year:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Some years ago the League mooted the idea of a technical institute\r\n     for Poplar. Mr. Crooks took it up and carried it to official\r\n     quarters, never letting the subject drop, until it stands at last\r\n     an accomplished fact. A School of Marine Engineering and Nautical\r\n     Academy has recently been opened in Poplar.\r\n\r\n     A handsome building has been erected in High Street, and in it will\r\n     be taught seamanship and navigation, marine engineering and naval\r\n     architecture and propulsion, general mechanical engineering,\r\n     electrical engineering, pattern making, carpentry and woodwork, and\r\n     theoretical and practical chemistry, physics, and mechanics.\r\n     Nothing more appropriate could have been built in Poplar. It is\r\n     mainly due to the tireless efforts of Mr. Crooks that it exists,\r\n     and it will stand as a monument to him.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Poplar boasts a greater monument to its Labour Councillor. He was on\r\nthe L.C.C. Bridges Committee during the making of Blackwall Tunnel. In\r\nits day the largest subaqueous tunnel in the world, its construction\r\ninvolved years of anxious labour.\r\n\r\nThe tunnel carries vehicular and passenger traffic under the Thames\r\nbetween Poplar and Greenwich, five miles below the nearest bridge, that\r\nat the Tower. Before it was made the two million Londoners living east\r\nof the bridges were without any public means of crossing the river. To\r\nbuild an ordinary bridge was impossible with so many ships passing night\r\nand day to and from the London Pool. It was decided to take the traffic\r\nunder the Thames by descending roadways leading to a tunnel some seventy\r\nfeet below high-water mark.\r\n\r\nFrom the time he joined the Council to that day in May, 1897, when the\r\nKing as Prince of Wales went down to Poplar to open the tunnel, on\r\nbehalf of Queen Victoria, Crooks was among the keenest of the public men\r\nengaged in carrying that great engineering feat through. He made himself\r\nso thoroughly master of the details that he was in great demand all over\r\nLondon as a lecturer on the tunnel. The chief engineers on the works who\r\nheard the lecture congratulated him on the way he made intelligible and\r\ninteresting the complicated system by which the tunnel was bored through\r\nthe clay within a foot or two of the river bed.\r\n\r\nSo satisfied were his fellow County Councillors with the practical work\r\nhe did at Blackwall that on its completion they elected him Chairman of\r\nthe Bridges Committee. In that capacity he steered through the Council\r\nand through a Committee of the House of Commons two other schemes for\r\ntunnels under the Thames, one for foot passengers only between Greenwich\r\nand the Isle of Dogs, and the other for general traffic between Shadwell\r\nand Rotherhithe, designed on a larger scale than the tunnel at\r\nBlackwall. Interest in these schemes, however, can never be so great as\r\nit was in the Blackwall experiment, the first of its kind attempted.\r\n\r\nIn the special Blackwall Tunnel number issued by the _Municipal\r\nJournal_, Crooks figures among those described as \"the men who made the\r\ntunnel.\" Following sketches and portraits of Sir Alexander Binnie (then\r\nthe L.C.C. engineer, who designed the tunnel), of Sir Weetman Pearson,\r\nM.P. (the contractor who executed the work), of Sir William Bull, M.P.\r\n(who was then chairman of the Bridges Committee), is a reference to\r\nother members of the Committee who took a prominent part in the work.\r\nThe first place after the chairman is given to Crooks. The _Municipal\r\nJournal_ says:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Mr. Will Crooks, more than any other man, has made Londoners\r\n     acquainted with the tunnel. His popular lecture on Blackwall Tunnel\r\n     has been given in all parts of London to all kinds of audiences,\r\n     and everywhere the clear, picturesque description Mr. Crooks has\r\n     given, aided by the lantern and his own genial wit, has made\r\n     intelligible to Londoners, old, young, rich, and poor, what is,\r\n     after all, a somewhat dry and difficult subject.\r\n\r\n     This only goes to show how closely Mr. Crooks himself has been\r\n     identified with the construction of the tunnel. As one of the\r\n     representatives of the Poplar district, he has turned his\r\n     membership of the Bridges Committee to good account by giving to\r\n     the tunnel his special attention. No Councillor has been so\r\n     frequent a visitor to the various works, and it is doubtful\r\n     whether any outsider went so many times into the compressed air.\r\n\r\n     The workmen had just cause to bless the Poplar County Councillor.\r\n     It was owing to Mr. Crooks's efforts that a revised schedule of\r\n     wages was adopted. The result of this was that the contractors paid\r\n     an additional £26,000 in wages. With all his zeal for the workmen,\r\n     Mr. Crooks never once came in conflict with either the contractors\r\n     or the engineers. Men and masters at Blackwall have all held the\r\n     worthy Labour Councillor in the highest regard, and both are sorry\r\n     that their long and cheerful connection must now be severed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same number of the _Municipal Journal_ contained an article by\r\nCrooks himself, entitled, \"A Labour View of the Blackwall Tunnel.\" The\r\narticle displayed with what tact and modesty the Labour member had\r\nsafeguarded the interests of his own class without neglecting the\r\ninterests of the people of London. It bore out the statement made in his\r\nfirst speech to the Council, that no contractor ever lost by paying the\r\ntrade union rate of wages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE TASK OF HIS LIFE BEGINS\r\n\r\n     Elected to the Poplar Board of Guardians--Bumbledom in\r\n     Power--Prison preferred to Workhouse--Poverty treated like Crime.\r\n\r\n\r\nSix months after his return to the London County Council, Poplar elected\r\nCrooks to the Board of Guardians. When he took his seat as a member in\r\nthe very Board-room where thirty years before he clung timorously to his\r\nmother's skirt he knew that the task of his life had begun.\r\n\r\nHe and his friend George Lansbury were elected together--the only Labour\r\nmen on a Board of twenty-four. They were the firstfruits of the reduced\r\nqualification for Guardians introduced by Mr. (afterwards Lord) Ritchie,\r\nat that time President of the Local Government Board.\r\n\r\nTo Crooks belongs much of the credit for this welcome change. He felt\r\nkeenly that working-men and women could never become Guardians of the\r\nPoor so long as the £40 property qualification remained. He persuaded\r\nthe Poplar Trustees, of whom he was one, to ask the Local Government\r\nBoard to make it possible for workpeople to become Guardians. Mr.\r\nRitchie, ever sympathetic towards the East-End, a division of which he\r\nwas then representing in Parliament, met this request from Poplar by\r\nlowering the qualification to £10. His successor at the Local Government\r\nBoard, Sir Henry Fowler, abolished the property qualification\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Crooks's election the dissatisfaction felt by ratepayers\r\nwith the old Guardians was deep and bitter. The Local Government Board\r\nhas evidence in its possession that poor people of the district were\r\nsaying at the time that if you wanted out-relief you must move into such\r\nand such a street, where rents were collected by someone who had\r\ninfluence with the Board.\r\n\r\nInside the workhouse Crooks found a state of things that seems\r\nincredible to-day. Bumbledom held sway over paupers and Guardians alike.\r\n\r\nThere were Guardians who had never been inside the workhouse once. When\r\nCrooks attempted to enter as a Guardian he found that the Master had\r\npower to shut the gate upon him. Without the Master's permission, except\r\non the regular House Committee days, Guardians had no legal right inside\r\nthe workhouse at all.\r\n\r\nThe two Labour men raised such a hubbub over this anomaly that Sir Henry\r\nFowler issued an order giving a Guardian the right to enter the\r\nworkhouse at any reasonable hour. As a result there began, not only in\r\nPoplar but all over the country, a marked improvement in the treatment\r\nof old people in workhouses.\r\n\r\nHere was a distinct score at the first venture. With the right of\r\nadmission established, Crooks made full use of it. He found most of the\r\nofficers hostile. So much so, that during a fire that broke out in the\r\nworkhouse bakery, bringing the brigade engines round, one of the\r\nofficers exclaimed, in the presence of the others when the fire was at\r\nits height:--\r\n\r\n\"The only thing wanting now is that Crooks and Lansbury should be put on\r\nthe top of it.\"\r\n\r\nThe cheers with which this remark was received were soon to give way to\r\ngrave concern. It was clear the two Labour men meant to put an end to\r\nmany things. Several of the officers were summarily suspended by Crooks\r\none morning when he appeared on the scene unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nA woman inmate had contrived to escape from the workhouse. She came\r\nround to his house and knocked him up. In consequence of an alarming\r\nstory she told him respecting the conditions under which a fellow inmate\r\nhad died in her arms that very night, Crooks hurried round to the\r\ninstitution and suspended certain of the officers on the spot.\r\n\r\nThe officers whom Crooks had suspended were dismissed by the Board. Nor\r\nwere they by any means the last to be dismissed or to take their\r\ndeparture, for other scandals were brought to light.\r\n\r\n\"We found the condition of things in the House almost revolting,\" Crooks\r\nstated in evidence before the Local Government Board Inquiry of 1906.\r\n\"The place was dirty. The stores were empty. The inmates had not\r\nsufficient clothes, and many were without boots to their feet. The food\r\nwas so bad that the wash-tubs overflowed with what the poor people\r\ncould not eat. It was almost heart-breaking to go round the place and\r\nhear the complaints and see the tears of the aged men and women.\r\n\r\n\"'Poverty's no crime, but here it's treated like crime,' they used to\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n\"Many of them defied the regulations on purpose to be charged before a\r\nmagistrate, declaring that prison was better than the workhouse.\r\n\r\n\"One day I went into the dining-room and found women sitting on the long\r\nforms, some sullen, some crying. In front of each was a basin of what\r\nwas alleged to be broth. They called it greasy water, and that was\r\nexactly what it looked and tasted like. They said they had to go out and\r\nwash blankets on that. I appealed to the master to give them something\r\nto eat, as they said they would sooner go to prison than commence work\r\non that. Those women, like the men, were continually contriving to get\r\nsent to prison in order to escape the workhouse. After a few heated\r\nwords between the master and me he gave them some food, and none of them\r\nwent to prison that day.\r\n\r\n\"A few weeks later I was in the workhouse when these same women were\r\ncreating a fearful uproar.\r\n\r\n\"'Ah, there you are,' said the master, meeting me. 'Go and look at your\r\nangels now! A nice lot they are to stick up for!'\r\n\r\n\"I went to the dining-room. There was a dead silence the moment I\r\nentered.\r\n\r\n\"'I am right down ashamed of you,' I said. 'When you were treated like\r\nanimals, no wonder you behaved like animals. Now that Mr. Lansbury and I\r\nhave got you treated like human beings, we expect you to behave like\r\nhuman beings.'\r\n\r\n\"They said not a word, and later in the day the ringleaders, without any\r\nprompting, came to me and expressed their regret. From that day to this\r\nno such scene among the workhouse women has ever been repeated.\r\n\r\n\"The staple diet when I joined the Board was skilly. I have seen the old\r\npeople, when this stuff was put before them, picking out black specks\r\nfrom the oatmeal. These were caused by rats, which had the undisturbed\r\nrun of the oatmeal bin. No attempt was made to cleanse the oatmeal\r\nbefore it was prepared for the old people.\r\n\r\n\"Whenever one went into the men's dining-room there were quarrels about\r\nthe food. I have had to protect old and weak men against stronger men,\r\nwho would steal what was eatable of their dinners. There was no\r\ndiscipline. The able-bodied men's dining-room on Sundays gave one as\r\nnear an approach to hell as anything on this earth. It was everybody for\r\nhimself and the devil take the hindmost. If a fellow could fight he got\r\nas much as he wanted. If he could not, he got nothing. Fights, followed\r\nby prosecutions at the police courts, were common. The men boasted that\r\nprison had no worse terrors than that place. They were absolutely beyond\r\ncontrol. They wandered about all over the place, creating all kinds of\r\ndiscord, and even threatening to murder the officers. Two labour masters\r\nnearly lost their lives in trying to control them.\r\n\r\n\"The inmates were badly clothed as well as badly fed. Not one of them\r\nhad a change of clothing. Their under-clothes were worn to rags. If they\r\nwashed them they had to borrow from each other in the interval.\r\n\r\n\"The inmates' clothes were not only scanty, they were filthy. On one\r\noccasion the whole of the workhouse linen was returned by the laundry\r\npeople because it was so over-run with vermin that they would not wash\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"One of the inmates--a woman--who was doing hard work at scrubbing every\r\nday, asked me whether she couldn't have a pair of boots.\r\n\r\n\"'Surely,' I said, putting her off for the time, 'nobody here goes\r\nwithout boots?'\r\n\r\n\"A second and a third time when I came across her scrubbing the floors\r\nshe pleaded for boots. She raised her skirt from the wet stone floor,\r\nand showed two sloppy pieces of canvas on her feet, and that was all she\r\nhad in the way of boots.\"\r\n\r\nCrooks went on to relate that he walked along the corridor and saw a\r\nfemale officer. \"There's a woman over there who has asked me three times\r\nto get her a pair of boots,\" he said.\r\n\r\nShe drew her skirt round her and said, \"Oh, why do you worry about\r\nthese people; they are not our class.\"\r\n\r\n\"Worry about them!\" Crooks rejoined. \"What do you mean by our class? We\r\nare here to see these people properly clothed. I do not want to quarrel,\r\nbut that woman must have a pair of boots to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE MAN WHO FED THE POOR\r\n\r\n     Chairman of the Poplar Board of Guardians--Bumbledom\r\n     Dethroned--Paupers' Garb Abolished--Two Presidents of the Local\r\n     Government Board Approve Crooks's Policy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis, then, was the state of the workhouse when Crooks went on the\r\nBoard. It was soon evident that a strong man had arrived. He whom some\r\nof the Guardians at first described as \"a ranter from the Labour mob\"\r\nsoon proved himself the best administrator among them.\r\n\r\nWithin five years of his election he was made Chairman. The Board\r\ninsisted on his retaining the chair for ten consecutive years. During\r\nthat time he wrought out of the shame and degradation he found in the\r\nworkhouse a system of order and decency and humane administration that\r\nfor a long time made the Poplar Union a model among Poor Law\r\nauthorities, and one frequently recommended by the Local Government\r\nBoard.\r\n\r\nOf course he made enemies. Some of the old Guardians whom he had turned\r\nout of public life nursed their resentment in secret. Others joined\r\nthem, including contractors who had fared lavishly under the old\r\n_régime_. Presently a Municipal Alliance was formed, and though it could\r\ndo nothing against Crooks at the poll, since the ratepayers would\r\npersist in placing him at the top, it found other methods of attacking\r\nhim, of which more hereafter.\r\n\r\nOne of the first things he aimed at was a change in the character both\r\nof officers and of Guardians. He saw no hope for the poor under the old\r\nrulers. At each succeeding election his opposition brought about the\r\ndefeat of the worst of them.\r\n\r\nThe officers could not be dealt with so publicly. Some of the officers\r\nin the infirmary, addicted to drunkenness, were able to defy the\r\nGuardians for an obvious reason. It was one of their duties to take\r\nwhisky and champagne into the infirmary for the delectation of some of\r\nthe Guardians, whom a billiard table often detained into the early\r\nhours. Crooks and Lansbury raised such indignation in the district as to\r\nmake it impossible for this state of things to continue.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 the Master and Matron resigned. Gradually the old school of\r\nworkhouse officials who had run the place as they liked were weeded out.\r\nA more intelligent, more sympathetic, better disciplined staff grew up\r\nin their place. Bumbledom was dethroned. The sick were nursed better.\r\nThe inmates were clothed better. All, both old and young, were fed\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nThe tell-tale pauper's garb disappeared altogether. When the old people\r\nwalked out they were no longer branded by their dress. They wore simple,\r\nhomely garments. They all rejoiced in the change save a few like the old\r\nwoman Crooks came across one afternoon on her day out. She was looking\r\nclean and comfortable, and he asked how she liked the new clothes.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all, Mr. Crooks. Nobody thinks you come from the workhouse now,\r\nso they don't give you anything.\"\r\n\r\nHis greatest reform had reference to the food. \"Skilly\" went the way of\r\n\"greasy water.\" Good plain wholesome meals appeared on the tables.\r\n\r\n\"And became more expensive,\" say the critics.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Crooks retorts; \"but to economise on the stomachs of the poor is\r\nfalse economy. If it's only cheapness you want, why don't you set up the\r\nlethal chamber for the old people? That would be the cheapest thing of\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\nLet us see what he actually gave these people to eat, since for feeding\r\nthe poor he was afterwards called to the bar of public opinion.\r\n\r\nFirst he developed the system of bread-baking in the workhouse, in order\r\nto get better and cheaper bread than was being supplied under contract\r\nfrom outside. Under the direction of one or two skilled bakers, the work\r\nprovided many of the inmates with pleasant and useful occupation. They\r\nmade all the bread required in the workhouse for both officers and\r\ninmates, all the bread required in the children's schools, all the\r\nloaves given away as out-relief.\r\n\r\nInstead of being likened to india-rubber, as it used to be in the old\r\ndays, the bread now came to be described by the _Daily Mail_ as equal to\r\nwhat could be obtained in the best restaurants in the West-End. Yet\r\nthey were making this bread in the workhouse cheaper than it was\r\npossible to buy ordinary bread outside.\r\n\r\nAnd then, for the benefit of the infirm old folk, Crooks persuaded the\r\nGuardians to substitute butter for margarine, and fresh meat for the\r\ncheap stale stuff so often supplied. He held out for milk that had not\r\nbeen skimmed, and for tea and coffee that had not been adulterated. He\r\neven risked his reputation by allowing the aged women to put sugar in\r\ntheir tea themselves, and the old men to smoke an occasional pipe of\r\ntobacco.\r\n\r\nRumours of this new way of feeding the workhouse poor reached the\r\naustere Local Government Board. First it sent down its inspectors, and\r\nthen the President himself appeared in person. And Mr. Chaplin saw that\r\nit was good, and told other Boards to do likewise. He issued a circular\r\nto the Guardians of the country recommending all that Poplar had\r\nintroduced. More, he proposed that for deserving old people over\r\nsixty-four years of age \"the supply of tobacco, dry tea, and sugar be\r\nmade compulsory.\"\r\n\r\nThis humane order of things, you may be sure, did not commend itself to\r\nall Guardian Boards; and when later there came further instructions from\r\nheadquarters that ailing inmates might be allowed \"medical comforts,\"\r\nthe revolt materialised. A deputation of Guardians went to Whitehall to\r\ntry to argue the President into a harder heart. Crooks and Lansbury were\r\nthere to uphold the new system. Mr. Walter Long had succeeded Mr.\r\nChaplin then. He listened patiently to ingenious speeches in which\r\nhonourable gentlemen tried to show that it was from no lack of love for\r\nthe poor they had not carried out the new dietary scale, but----\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" Mr. Long interrupted at last, \"am I to understand you do\r\nnot desire to feed your poor people properly?\"\r\n\r\nThen all with one accord began to make excuse. It was the difficulty of\r\nbook-keeping, they said. It appeared they were prepared to stint the\r\npoor rather than add to the book-keeping.\r\n\r\nFrom that day an improved dietary scale was introduced into our\r\nworkhouses. The man who fed the poor in Poplar saw the workhouse poor of\r\nthe kingdom better fed in consequence.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of food was it that Poplar dared to give to the poor? Those\r\n\"luxuries for paupers\" down at Poplar, about which the world was to hear\r\nso much, what were they? A working-man had appeared, and after years of\r\nunwearied well-doing had got rid of \"skilly\" and \"greasy water,\"\r\nsubstituting, with the approval of two Presidents of the Local\r\nGovernment Board, the following simple articles of food.\r\n\r\nObserve the list carefully, for the kinds and quantities of food here\r\nset out were precisely those supplied to the able-bodied inmates during\r\nthe outcry that arose over \"paupers' luxuries\" at the time of the Local\r\nGovernment Board Inquiry in 1906. The list is the official return of the\r\nfood supplied in one week to each inmate.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   A MAN'S DIET FOR A WEEK.\r\n\r\n                         (COST, 4s. 2d.)\r\n\r\n     Breakfasts   Bread                  3½ lbs.\r\n                  Butter                 3½ ozs.\r\n                  Coffee                 7 pints.\r\n     Dinners      Mutton                 13½ ozs.\r\n                  Beef                   4½ ozs.\r\n                  Bacon                  3 ozs.\r\n                  Irish stew             1 pint.\r\n                  Boiled pork            4½ ozs.\r\n                  Bread                  14 ozs.\r\n                  Potatoes and greens    4½ lbs.\r\n     Suppers      Bread                  3½ lbs.\r\n                  Butter                 3½ ozs.\r\n                  Tea                    7 pints.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 A WOMAN'S DIET FOR A WEEK.\r\n\r\n                          (COST, 4s.)\r\n\r\n     Breakfasts   Bread                  2-5/8 lbs.\r\n                  Butter                 3½ ozs.\r\n                  Coffee                 7 pints.\r\n     Dinners      Mutton                 12 ozs.\r\n                  Beef                   4 ozs.\r\n                  Bacon                  3 ozs.\r\n                  Irish stew             1 pint.\r\n                  Boiled pork            4 ozs.\r\n                  Bread                  1¾ lbs.\r\n                  Potatoes and greens    3 lbs.\r\n     Suppers      Bread                  2-5/8 lbs.\r\n                  Butter                 3½ ozs.\r\n                  Tea                    7 pints.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you read down that list and think of the scare headlines that\r\nappeared in London daily papers during the Inquiry--\"Splendid Paupers,\"\r\n\"Luxuries for Paupers,\" \"A Pauper's Paradise\"--you may well ask, Are we\r\nliving in bountiful England? Or have we fallen upon an England of meagre\r\ndiet and mean men, an England that whines like a miser when called upon\r\nto feed on homely fare its broken-down veterans of industry?\r\n\r\nDickens is dead, else would he have shown us Bumble reincarnated in the\r\neditors of certain London newspapers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTURNING WORKHOUSE CHILDREN INTO USEFUL CITIZENS\r\n\r\n     A Home for Little \"Ins-and-Outs\"--Technical Education for Workhouse\r\n     Children--A Good Report for the Forest Gate Schools--Trophies won\r\n     by Scholars--The Children's Pat-a-Cakes.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter he had fed the old people and clothed the old people, and in other\r\nways brought into their darkened lives a little good cheer, Crooks\r\nturned his care upon the workhouse children.\r\n\r\nThe Guardians' school at Forest Gate lay four miles from the Union\r\nbuildings at Poplar. With five or six hundred children always under\r\ntraining in the school there still remained varying batches of neglected\r\nlittle people in the workhouse. The greater number of these belonged to\r\nparents who came into the House for short periods only.\r\n\r\nThese little \"ins-and-outs\" were getting no schooling and no training\r\nsave the training that fitted them for pauperism. What to do with them\r\nhad long been a perplexing problem. If they were sent to Forest Gate one\r\nday their parents in the workhouse could demand them back the next day\r\nand take their discharge, even though they and their children turned up\r\nat the gates for re-admission within the next twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nWhen Crooks proposed the simple expedient of sending these children to\r\nthe surrounding day-schools everybody seemed amazed.\r\n\r\nThe idea had never been heard of before. The London School Board of the\r\nday did not take kindly to it at all. It poured cold water on the\r\nproject at first. The neighbouring schools were nearly all full, and the\r\nBoard thought it would hear no more of the matter by suggesting that if\r\nthe Guardians could find vacant places they were at liberty of course to\r\nsend the children.\r\n\r\nCrooks framed an answering letter that it was the School Board's duty to\r\nfind the places, and that, come what would, the Guardians were\r\ndetermined to send the children to the day schools.\r\n\r\nSoon places were found for all. The little people who, through neglect\r\nand idleness in the workhouse, had been getting steeped in pauperism,\r\nwere now dressed in non-institution clothes, and they went to and from\r\nthe neighbouring schools, playing on the way like any other children.\r\n\r\nThat was the beginning of a system destined to have a far-reaching\r\neffect on Poor Law children all over the country. Other Unions, faced\r\nwith the same problem, seeing how well it had been dealt with at Poplar,\r\nwent and did likewise.\r\n\r\nThe Labour Guardian did not rest there. The children were a great deal\r\nbetter for coming in daily contact with the outside world, but much of\r\nthe good work was undone by their having to spend every night in the\r\nworkhouse. He wanted to keep them away altogether from its\r\ncontaminating influence. He persuaded the Guardians to purchase a large\r\ndwelling house about a quarter of a mile away from the workhouse. This\r\nbecame a real home for the children. There they are brought up and\r\nregularly sent to the public day schools outside, entirely free from\r\nworkhouse surroundings.\r\n\r\nSo long as the mark of the workhouse clings to children, so long, says\r\nCrooks, will children cling to the workhouse. That is what makes him so\r\nkeen in getting rid of the institution dress and of everything else\r\nlikely to brand a child.\r\n\r\nHe helped to banish all that suggested pauperism from the Forest Gate\r\nSchool. The children were educated and grew up, not like workhouse\r\nchildren, as before, but like the children of working parents. With what\r\nresult? Marked out in their childhood as being \"from the workhouse,\"\r\nthey often bore the stamp all their life and ended up as workhouse\r\ninmates in their manhood and womanhood. Under the new system, they were\r\nmade to feel like ordinary working-class children. They grew up like\r\nthem, becoming ordinary working-men and working-women themselves; so\r\nthat the Poor Law knew them no longer.\r\n\r\n\"If I can't appeal to your moral sense, let me appeal to your pocket,\"\r\nCrooks once remarked at a Guildhall Poor Law Conference. \"Surely it is\r\nfar cheaper to be generous in training Poor Law children to take their\r\nplace in life as useful citizens than it is to give the children a\r\nniggardly training and a branded career. This latter way soon lands\r\nthem in the workhouse again, to be kept out of the rates for the rest of\r\ntheir lives.\"\r\n\r\nHow far the principle was carried out at Forest Gate may be judged from\r\nthe report made by Mr. Dugard, H.M. Inspector of Schools, after one of\r\nhis visits. Thus:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     There is very little (if any) of the institution mark among the\r\n     children.... Both boys' and girls' schools are in a highly\r\n     satisfactory state, showing increased efficiency, with increased\r\n     intelligence on the part of the children.... They compare very\r\n     favourably with the best elementary schools.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all that related to games and healthful recreation Crooks agreed in\r\ngiving the scholars the fullest facilities. The lads were encouraged to\r\nsend their football and cricket teams to play other schools. The girls\r\ndeveloped under drill and gymnastic training, and became proficient\r\nswimmers.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the scholars at Forest Gate began to count for something. They\r\nlearnt to trust each other and to rely upon themselves. They grew in\r\nhope and courage. They learnt to walk honourably before all men. In\r\nconsequence, thousands of them have become merged in the great working\r\nworld outside, self-respecting men and women.\r\n\r\nI met Crooks looking elated one evening, and he told me he had just come\r\nfrom the Poor Law schools' swimming competition at Westminster baths.\r\n\r\n\"There were three trophies,\" he said. \"The first, the London Shield, was\r\nfor boys. Poplar won that with 85 marks, five more than the next best.\r\nThe second, the Portsmouth Shield, was for girls, with a Portsmouth\r\nschool competing. Our Poplar girls won that with 65 marks, the two next\r\nschools getting only 35 each. The third trophy, the Whitehall Shield,\r\nfor the school as a whole with the highest number of marks, was also won\r\nby Poplar. I feel as pleased as though I'd done it myself.\"\r\n\r\nThe best administration in an out-of-date building is always hampered.\r\nForest Gate belonged to the old order of Poor Law schools known as\r\nbarrack buildings. Although the Guardians made the very best of the\r\nschool, there were structural defects that hindered the work seriously.\r\nIt was therefore decided to build cottage homes at Shenfield in Essex,\r\nwhere a special effort is being made to train the girls as well as the\r\nboys in rural pursuits in order to keep them out of the overcrowded\r\ncities.\r\n\r\nThe Parliamentary Committee on Poor Law Schools that sat in 1896 invited\r\nCrooks to give evidence. Many of the things he urged were included in\r\nthe Committee's recommendations. Among them was the extension of the\r\nfull benefit of the Education Act and the Technical Education Acts to\r\nall Poor Law children.\r\n\r\n\"The wine and spirit dues that provide the technical education grants,\"\r\nhe told the committee, \"might be said to belong to Poor Law children by\r\nright, because it is always being urged that it is owing to drunken\r\nparents that these children get into the workhouse. I don't believe it,\r\nbut there is the claim.\"\r\n\r\nAt that time the Poor Law schools received no benefits in the way of\r\nscholarships or technical education grants. It was largely due to his\r\nadvocacy that the scholars were at last given the same opportunities as\r\nother children. One of the great moments of his life was when he opened\r\na letter from the headmaster at the Hunslet Poor Law school, telling him\r\nthat \"in consequence of what you have done, one of our boys has just\r\ntaken a County Scholarship--the first Poor Law child to benefit under\r\nthe Technical Education Acts.\"\r\n\r\nCrooks would like to go much further. Until Poor Law children are taken\r\nentirely away from the control of Guardians he will never be satisfied.\r\nWhy should the authority that looks after workhouses for the old and\r\ninfirm be entrusted with the task of training the young? The two duties\r\nlie as far apart as East from West. He would place these children wholly\r\nunder the education authority.\r\n\r\nNo matter where, he is always ready to put in a word for Poor Law\r\nchildren on the least opportunity. It was news to his colleagues on the\r\nLondon County Council when, in the course of a debate in the summer of\r\n1894, he told of his own experience in a Poor Law school. He seems to\r\nhave made a deep impression by his speech on that occasion, judging by\r\nthe following comment made shortly afterwards by the _Municipal\r\nJournal_;--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Those who heard Mr. Crooks's speech in the Council Chamber, when\r\n     the subject of the training of Poor Law children came up on a side\r\n     issue, will not readily forget it. One of the daily papers, in its\r\n     admiration the next day, declared it to be the best speech heard at\r\n     the Council. Be that as it may, the speech, coming spontaneously\r\n     with the pent-up indignation of a soul that had suffered sorely\r\n     from a pernicious system, was a marvellous one, producing a\r\n     marvellous effect. Councillors in the front benches turned round\r\n     and visitors in the gallery stretched forward to catch a glimpse of\r\n     the short dark figure on the Labour bench pleading so powerfully\r\n     for the children of the poor.\r\n\r\n\r\nNor had he been in the House of Commons long before his voice was heard\r\nthere on behalf of workhouse children. Speaking in a debate in 1903 on\r\nthe various methods of dealing with these children, he said:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     At one time there was no stronger advocate of boarding-out than\r\n     myself. It is an ideal system in theory, but its success by\r\n     practical application has yet to be proved. Many requests are made\r\n     by country people to be allowed to adopt children on charitable\r\n     grounds, but when inquiries come to be made into the incomes of\r\n     these people the Guardians generally find it is hoped to make a\r\n     profit out of the children. I have visited a village where a widow\r\n     boarded four children--two more than the law allows. For these\r\n     children she was paid sixteen shillings a week. She lived in a\r\n     district where the labourer's wages were only eleven shillings.\r\n\r\n     In regard to another case I personally investigated, I asked how\r\n     the boy was getting on.\r\n\r\n     \"Oh, all right; but he is growing so big and eats such a lot that I\r\n     wish you would take him away and send me a smaller boy.\"\r\n\r\n     The boarded-out children, so far from losing the pauper taint, are\r\n     more frequently known by the name of the Union from which they\r\n     come than by their own names. In fact, in some villages, I found\r\n     \"boarding-out\" a staple industry. Boarding-out is all right in good\r\n     homes; the difficulty is to find good homes.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot long after he made this speech, there was an outcry in a section of\r\nthe Press over \"an amazing example of extravagance\" at Poplar. It\r\nappeared in the form of a letter from a correspondent. The\r\ncorrespondent--who turned out to be a member of a firm of\r\ncontractors--waxed virtuously indignant over the Guardians' tenders\r\nbecause they included, he alleged, supplies of luxuries for paupers. The\r\nso-called luxuries for the most part proved to be medical comforts\r\nordered by the doctor for the ailing. Among the other items was 1 cwt.\r\nof pat-a-cake biscuits, and these were singled out specially as a\r\nspecimen of how the workhouse inmates were pampered.\r\n\r\nI met Crooks in the Lobby of the House of Commons at the time of the\r\noutcry, and asked what he thought of it all.\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly true,\" he said. \"We in Poplar are guilty of the great crime\r\nof inviting tenders for the supply of a few pat-a-cakes; but our\r\nhorrified critics are in error in assuming that the pat-a-cakes are for\r\nthe workhouse inmates. They are for the children. We order 1 cwt. for\r\nthe half-year, which I believe works out at the rate of a cake for each\r\nchild about once a week. There's extravagance for you! Isn't it\r\nscandalous? Just imagine our kiddies in the workhouse school getting a\r\nwhole pat-a-cake to eat!\r\n\r\n\"That's not the worst of it. Those youngsters of ours, not content with\r\ngetting an occasional pat-a-cake, have actually been overheard to sing\r\nthe nursery rhyme on the subject. We shall be having a Local Government\r\nBoard inspector sent down to stop it if it leaks out. You should hear\r\nthe little ones holding forth!\r\n\r\n\r\n     Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake, baker's man,\r\n     Bake me a cake as fast as you can!\r\n     Prick it, and pat it, and mark it with T,\r\n     And put it in the oven for Tommy and me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The youngsters lie awake at nights, wondering when their turn will come\r\nagain to have a farthing pat-a-cake. One of the little girls came\r\nrunning up to me in the playground the other day, exclaiming: 'Oh, Mr.\r\nCrooks, what do you think? I had a pat-a-cake for tea last Sunday. They\r\npromised it to us the day before, and I was so pleased when I went to\r\nbed that night that I nearly forgot to go to sleep.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nON THE METROPOLITAN ASYLUMS BOARD\r\n\r\n     Mr. Chaplin's Humane Circular to Poor Law Guardians--Crooks\r\n     Appointed a Member of the Metropolitan Asylums Board--Chairman of\r\n     the Children's Committee--His Knack of Getting His Own\r\n     Way--Reorganising the Labour Conditions of the Board's Workmen.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the policy of Poor Law reform which Crooks was\r\ncarrying out at Poplar won the good-will of the Local Government Board.\r\nSoon after Mr. Henry Chaplin took his seat in Lord Salisbury's Cabinet\r\nof 1895 he sent for Crooks, and the two spent a whole morning discussing\r\nthe weak points in our Poor Law system. Mr. Chaplin made many notes\r\nduring the conversation, and at parting good-naturedly remarked that\r\nCrooks had given him enough work to occupy the next two or three years.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards, the Minister and the Labour man made a personal\r\ninvestigation of Poplar and other East-End workhouses and infirmaries.\r\nThe visit to each institution was a surprise one. When the two men\r\nentered the children's ward of the Mile End workhouse, they found the\r\nnurses absent and the children screaming. In about half a minute Crooks\r\nhad all the children laughing.\r\n\r\n\"What's the secret of your magic?\" asked the President of the Local\r\nGovernment Board.\r\n\r\n\"It comes natural when you are used to them,\" said Crooks.\r\n\r\nAs already shown, Mr. Chaplin declared emphatically for the Poplar\r\npolicy. His notable circular to Poor Law Guardians, for which as\r\nPresident of the Local Government Board he will perhaps be best\r\nremembered, gave the support of the Government of the day to that policy\r\nof humane administration of the Poor Law which Crooks had established at\r\nPoplar. It laid down three principles which the Labour man had urged\r\nupon the President at their first meeting:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     1. Children to be entirely removed from association with the\r\n     workhouse and workhouse surroundings.\r\n\r\n     2. Old people of good character who have relatives or friends\r\n     outside not to be forced into the workhouse, but to be given\r\n     adequate out-relief.\r\n\r\n     3. Old people in the workhouse of good behaviour to be provided\r\n     with additional comforts.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Chaplin further showed his confidence in the Labour Chairman of the\r\nPoplar Guardians by inviting him to become one of the Local Government\r\nBoard's representatives on the Metropolitan Asylums Board. The work\r\nmeant a heavy addition to Crooks's public duties, with the London County\r\nCouncil and the Poplar Guardians demanding so much of his time. There\r\nwas no hesitation, however, in accepting the new office when he found it\r\nafforded further opportunities to serve the afflicted poor and help\r\nneglected children. Mr. Chaplin's successor at the Local Government\r\nBoard, Mr. Walter Long, twice re-nominated Crooks to the same position.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Asylums Board comes but little before public notice, except\r\nin times of epidemic, it has far-reaching powers. It is the largest\r\nhospital authority that any country can show. It has fourteen infectious\r\ndisease hospitals with accommodation for nearly seven thousand people.\r\nIt maintains six thousand imbecile patients in four asylums. It looks\r\nafter the welfare of several hundred boys on a Thames training-ship, and\r\nof some two thousand children in various homes.\r\n\r\nThe members, or \"managers,\" as they are called, are all nominated either\r\nby London Boards of Guardians or by the Local Government Board. An\r\nindirectly elected body is the last that expects to see a representative\r\nof Labour. Imagine, therefore, the amazement of this somewhat select\r\ncompany when, in May, 1898, a Labour man walked into their midst as the\r\nnominee of a Conservative Cabinet Minister.\r\n\r\nHe was eyed at first with suspicion. The suspicion soon changed to\r\ncuriosity. The Labour man never spoke. The managers expected a torrent\r\nof loud criticism, and here was immovable silence. For the first five\r\nmonths Crooks never opened his mouth at the Board meetings.\r\n\r\n\"What's your game?\" asked a friendly member in an aside one afternoon.\r\n\r\n\"I'm learning the business,\" was the quiet reply. \"This is an old\r\nestablished Board with notions of its own, and it's not going to be\r\ndictated to by new-comers. But you wait, my friend, and you'll find\r\nbefore long I'll be getting my own way in everything here.\"\r\n\r\nSo it proved. During the two or three years that he was Chairman of the\r\nChildren's Committee and of a special committee that reorganised the\r\nhours and wages of the Board's large staff, he never lost a single\r\nrecommendation he brought before the Board.\r\n\r\n\"How is it, Mr. Crooks, that whatever you ask this Board for you always\r\nget?\" he was once asked by Sir Edwin Galsworthy, for many years the\r\nBoard's Chairman.\r\n\r\nCrooks returned the sally that it was because he was always right. His\r\nreal secret was--convert the whole of your committee. A majority vote in\r\ncommittee never satisfied him. Nothing short of the support of every\r\nsingle member would suffice. Many times in committee has he adjourned\r\nthe discussion rather than snatch a bare majority.\r\n\r\n\"Let's take it home with us,\" he would say jocularly from the chair.\r\n\"Perhaps after a week's thought you'll all come back converted to my\r\nview. If not, then you must come better prepared to convince me that I\r\nam wrong than you are now.\"\r\n\r\nThe difficult and delicate work of reorganising the Labour conditions of\r\nthe Board's workmen and attendants was at last brought to a triumph. He\r\ncame out of the chair with the goodwill of the whole staff and of the\r\nentire Board of Managers. His colleagues included large employers of\r\nlabour, eminent medical men, and retired army and navy officers. All\r\nagreed that he had settled for them Labour difficulties which had\r\ncreated nothing but confusion and perplexity before.\r\n\r\nWorking on his invariable rule that it pays best in every department of\r\nwork to observe fair conditions, he scored a signal success on the very\r\nbody where before his coming Labour members were regarded as\r\nrevolutionaries. As at Blackwall Tunnel, he gained his points without\r\nlosing the trust or friendship of the employers of labour.\r\n\r\nThe task put his administrative ability to a test which only able\r\nstatesmen can stand. The rare faculty he has of obtaining the maximum of\r\nreform out of existing agencies carried him safely over every shoal.\r\n\r\nCrooks is every inch an Englishman as well as every inch a Labour\r\nmember. He applies his Labour principles on typical English lines; hence\r\nhis success among all bodies of Englishmen, no matter what their party\r\nor class.\r\n\r\nFew men have higher ideals or feel more deeply the injustice of much in\r\nour present-day social system, but Crooks recognises that the only way\r\nto get reform is to put your hand to the plough with things as they are,\r\nand not wait for the millennium before getting to work.\r\n\r\nHe sees the crooked things of this life as keenly as anyone, but because\r\nthe things cannot be put wholly straight in his own day he does not\r\nhold aloof. He does what he can in the living present to put them as\r\nnearly straight as existing machinery makes possible, trusting that the\r\nnext or some succeeding generation will continue the work until the\r\nthings are put perfectly straight at last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nA BAD BOYS' ADVOCATE\r\n\r\n     Efforts on behalf of Diseased and Mentally-deficient\r\n     Children--Altering the Law in Six Weeks--Establishing Remand Homes\r\n     for First Offenders--London's Vagrant Child-Life--Reformatory and\r\n     Industrial Schools--The Boy who Sat on the Fence--Theft of a Donkey\r\n     and Barrow--Lads who want Mothering.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon the call of the children reached his ears again.\r\n\r\nHe had barely finished reorganising the labour conditions on the Asylums\r\nBoard when he undertook a great task in the interests of the two\r\nthousand children who had just been placed under the Board's care. These\r\nchildren were all sufferers from some physical or mental trouble, and it\r\nwas because they required special treatment that a Parliamentary\r\nCommittee had recommended that they be transferred from the London\r\nGuardians to the Asylums Board.\r\n\r\nA comprehensive scheme had to be framed by the Board for looking after\r\nits new charges. Crooks gave three hard years to these children's\r\nwell-being. During that time, as Chairman of the Children's Committee,\r\nhe wrought some remarkable changes in the lot of the diseased and\r\nmentally-deficient little people handed over to the Board's keeping.\r\n\r\nNew homes were set up in the country and at the seaside for the\r\nafflicted and convalescent children. The little people's meals were made\r\npleasant, their clothes deprived of the institutional taint. They were\r\nfree to be merry, and their laughter was better medicine than the\r\ndoctor's.\r\n\r\nThe sad lot of the mentally-deficient children, some of them little\r\nbetter than imbeciles, appealed greatly to the strong, clear-brained\r\nLabour man from Poplar. There were three or four hundred of these, all\r\nfrom London workhouses, the sight of whom so often reminded Crooks of\r\nthe idiot boy who slept in his dormitory when he, as a child, was an\r\ninmate at Poplar.\r\n\r\nThe Asylums Board was not allowed to keep these mentally-deficient boys\r\nand girls after sixteen years of age. The children had thus to be sent\r\naway only half trained, often direct to the workhouse again, from which\r\nthey never emerged unless to be taken to an institution more hopeless\r\nstill.\r\n\r\nCrooks conceived the idea that if the Board kept these luckless little\r\npeople until they completed their twenty-first year it might be possible\r\nto give them such a training as would enable them to look after\r\nthemselves outside, and live useful lives, instead of being a\r\nlife-burden to the State and of no use to anyone. The Local Government\r\nBoard agreed, and the managers now train these youthful charges till\r\nthey reach manhood and womanhood.\r\n\r\nThe experiment has already justified itself. Many a youth and maid who\r\nwould have been left in mental darkness all their lives have by this\r\nlonger period of training gained a glimmering of light. Their limited\r\nintelligence has been sufficiently developed to enable them to assist at\r\nearning their own living and to look after themselves.\r\n\r\nOther children under the Board's care might be said to suffer from an\r\nexcess rather than from a lack of intelligence. On the Asylums Board\r\nthey are known as remand children. In the police courts they are known\r\nas first offenders. They consist of boys and girls who, having been\r\ncharged before a magistrate with offences which render them liable to be\r\nsent to an industrial or a reformatory school, get remanded for\r\ninquiries.\r\n\r\nAt one time, pending the inquiries, these youthful offenders used to be\r\ndetained in prison. When Crooks joined the Asylums Board they had been\r\ntransferred to the workhouse. The influence for evil was little better\r\nin the one place than in the other. The one introduced them to\r\ncriminality, the other to pauperism.\r\n\r\n\"These children want keeping as far as possible from both prison and\r\nworkhouse,\" argued Crooks with his colleagues. \"We ought to put them in\r\nsmall homes and give them school-time and playtime, like other children,\r\nuntil their cases come before the magistrate again.\"\r\n\r\nSo two or three dwelling-houses were taken in different quarters of\r\nLondon and adapted as Remand Homes. Crooks headed a deputation from the\r\nAsylums Board to the London magistrates at Bow Street to urge them in\r\nfuture to commit all remand children to the Homes. The magistrates were\r\nsympathetic enough, but showed it was their duty to carry out the law,\r\nand that the law clearly laid it down that youthful offenders under\r\nremand must be sent to the workhouse.\r\n\r\n\"We'll alter the law, then,\" was Crooks's reply. \"For I'm determined\r\nthese youngsters shall no longer be sent to the workhouse.\"\r\n\r\nIn the record time of six weeks the law was altered. It sounds\r\nmiraculous to those who know the ways of Whitehall. Crooks's resource\r\nproved more than equal to red-tapeism.\r\n\r\nFirst the Asylums Board wrote to the Home Office. Then the Home Office\r\nsent the usual evasive reply. The correspondence would have gone on\r\nindefinitely had not Crooks waited on the Home Secretary in person.\r\n\r\nAs the Labour man expected, Mr. Ritchie knew nothing about the matter,\r\nthe Home Office officials having settled it without consulting the\r\nSecretary of State. Always willing to co-operate in anything that\r\npromised to keep children away from the workhouse, Mr. Ritchie asked\r\nCrooks what he had to suggest. The visitor pointed out that the Juvenile\r\nOffenders' Bill was at that very moment before Parliament, and that the\r\ninsertion in that measure of an additional clause of half a dozen lines\r\nonly would keep remand children away from the workhouse for all time.\r\nThe Home Secretary seized the idea at once, and Crooks's suggestion\r\nbecame law the following month.\r\n\r\nThe first of the Remand Homes was opened at Pentonville Road for the\r\nconvenience of children charged at the police courts of North London and\r\nthe East-End. Sometimes as many as fifty young offenders, boys and\r\ngirls, can be seen there at the same time.\r\n\r\nInstead of loafing about the workhouse, as before, and becoming inured\r\nto pauper surroundings, they are now taught as in a day school. They\r\nhave play in the open air and recreation indoors in the way of games and\r\nbooks. Moreover, the girls are taught to sew and knit, the boys\r\ninstructed in manual work. Though seldom there more than a fortnight\r\nbefore being taken back to the police court, they go away cleaner,\r\nbetter informed, not without hope. And the magistrates now feel\r\njustified in sending about 80 per cent. of them back to their parents.\r\n\r\nA visit to this Remand Home at Pentonville will teach you disquieting\r\ntruths about the vagrant child-life of London. These wayward youngsters\r\ntell their tales with startling frankness.\r\n\r\nThat bright-faced lad of twelve--why is he here?\r\n\r\n\"Stealing,\" he answers us.\r\n\r\n\"What did you steal?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some stockings outside a shop.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"To get money for sweets.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where did you sell the stockings?\"\r\n\r\n\"In a pub.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever stolen before?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"How often?\"\r\n\r\n\"A good many times, but never been caught before.\"\r\n\r\nTwo of the oldest lads approached, and we questioned them.\r\n\r\n\"I was took up for begging,\" said No. 1. \"But I weren't begging--on'y\r\nlooking for work.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"At King's Cross--me and him,\" pointing to his neighbour. \"We was\r\noffering to carry people's bags when the copper come and took us up.\"\r\n\r\nThe teacher explained that boys soliciting passengers around the big\r\nrailway stations were becoming such a nuisance that the police sometimes\r\nhad to take them into custody.\r\n\r\n\"We didn't get hold of a man's arm and say, 'Give us threepence,' as the\r\ncopper said,\" the youthful informant went on. \"We was on'y looking for\r\nwork.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long have you been looking for this kind of work?\"\r\n\r\n\"We goes an' looks for it every day,\" said No. 2 (in shirt sleeves, like\r\nhis pal). \"And sometimes we makes half a crown, and sometimes three\r\nshillings a day, carrying gentlemen's bags. I've been a-doing of it five\r\nmonths. It pays better than reg'lar work, where I used to make ten\r\nshillings a week.\"\r\n\r\nNo. 1 could not forget his grievance against the police.\r\n\r\n\"Puts us in the cell all night,\" he interposed, \"and gives us coffee and\r\ntwo thick slices of bread for supper. And takes us in a bumpy ole van\r\nto the police court in the morning along of a lot of others. Then we was\r\nsent here, where we has to write and read--just like going back to\r\nschool again.\"\r\n\r\nAnother lad was there for \"stopping out all night,\" according to his own\r\nrendering. When we asked \"Why?\" the answer came prompt enough, \"'Cos I\r\nlikes it.\"\r\n\r\n\"How many nights did you stay out?\"\r\n\r\n\"Me and them,\" indicating others higher up the room, \"we slept behind\r\nthe fire station four nights and then went home.\"\r\n\r\n\"What happened then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mother said nofink, but she got a stick----\"\r\n\r\nHe paused sufficiently long for us to take the sequel for granted, then\r\nadded quietly:--\r\n\r\n\"So I stopped out the next night.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the copper came.\"\r\n\r\nYes, they need \"homes,\" indeed, these wayward youngsters, ensnared by\r\nthe temptations of London's streets. Some are here for gambling in the\r\ngutter, many for playing truant, some for sleeping out, and others for\r\nfelony. Generally they are sent home if it be a first offence, or to a\r\nreformatory if the case be a bad one.\r\n\r\nThere are girls here, too. What of them?\r\n\r\n\"Me and my sister was taken up by the police for sleeping on a\r\ndoorstep,\" said one sad-eyed little maid in a blue frock.\r\n\r\n\"Why on a doorstep?\"\r\n\r\n\"Father left us, and when mother died the landlord turned us out.\"\r\n\r\nTrue enough, and the sisters will be sent to a girls' home shortly.\r\n\r\nThat is the best that can be done for the girls, especially the large\r\nnumber that are brought away from houses of ill-repute.\r\n\r\nThe boys who get committed to reformatories still find themselves under\r\nCrooks's eye. While the Asylums Board looks after them when under\r\nremand, the London County Council becomes responsible once the lads are\r\ncommitted. This dual control Crooks is trying to get rid of, in the hope\r\nthat the duty will be given wholly into the hands of one authority.\r\n\r\nFor several years he was a member and at one time Chairman of the L.C.C.\r\nCommittee that looks after the industrial and reformatory schools. The\r\ncommittee meets at Feltham, where is the largest of the institutions\r\nunder its charge. It was rare for Crooks to be absent during his\r\nmembership of the committee.\r\n\r\nHe and Colonel Rotton, who was also Chairman for a period, could\r\ngenerally make the lads on arrival understand them without much\r\nparleying. Every lad, on being committed to the school by a magistrate,\r\nhad to appear before the committee. Here are some characteristic\r\ndialogues:--\r\n\r\n\"Well, my boy, what are you here for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Burglary.\" The burglar was nine years of age.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you can't be a burglar here, but you can be a good lad. Everyone\r\ncan be a good lad here if he likes. If he doesn't like we make him. What\r\nwill you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I fink I'll like, sir.\"\r\n\r\nGenerally the lads do not admit their offence so readily. They are not\r\nalways so frank as you find them in the Remand Homes. Most of them, when\r\nbefore the Committee, find excuses, like the boy who was caught with\r\nothers stealing in a railway goods yard.\r\n\r\n\"Please, sir, it weren't me at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"We always get the wrong boy. What are you supposed to be here for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fieving, sir. But I didn't do it. I were on'y sitting on the fence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let this be a lesson to you. Never sit on the fence. Do you know\r\nthe Ten Commandments?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you say the Lord's Prayer?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; we wasn't taught it at the school wot I used to go to.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you didn't go to school.\"\r\n\r\n\"The boy wot did go told me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we'll see to it that you do go to school now.\"\r\n\r\nAnother new-comer excused himself more ingeniously:--\"Me and my mate we\r\nfound a donkey and barrer at Covent Garden. We saw a man's name on the\r\nbarrer, and fought if we went off wif the donkey we would git a shilling\r\nthe next day for taking it back to him. But a copper stopped us as we\r\nwas leading the donkey over Waterloo Bridge. So we hadn't a chance to\r\ntake it back, as we was going to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, you must stay with us until you learn that donkeys in\r\nbarrows are not necessarily lost.\"\r\n\r\nCrooks believed in giving the boys plenty of play and plenty of work.\r\nNearly all their offences he believed to be due to excess of vitality.\r\nThey had never had a chance of working it off in a proper way before.\r\nBesides, many of the lads needed mothering. It was always his regret\r\nthat he could not persuade his colleagues on the Committee to adopt a\r\nsystem he found in vogue in the Moss Hill industrial school in Glasgow.\r\nWhen visiting that institution he was agreeably surprised to find about\r\na dozen \"mothers\" on the staff. If a lad tore his coat or pulled off a\r\nbutton, he knew which particular \"mother\" to run to in order to be\r\npatched up.\r\n\r\n\"I have always said, and shall always continue to say,\" he states, \"that\r\nreformatory schools ought to be made a State charge entirely. If there\r\nis any part of the community that can be called a national debt, it is\r\nthis class of poor, misguided lads who, if they were properly cared for,\r\nwould soon become a valuable national asset.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nPROUD OF THE POOR\r\n\r\n     The Handy Man of Poplar--Peacemaker among his Neighbours--Piloting\r\n     the Author of \"In His Steps\" through the Slums--Difference between\r\n     a Street Arab and a Prince--Object Lesson for a Professor of\r\n     Political Economy--How the Poor help the Poor.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring these years the saying grew up among his neighbours that nothing\r\nhappens in Poplar without someone running to Will Crooks about it. His\r\nlittle house at 28, Northumberland Street, to the north of East India\r\nDock Road, was the gathering ground of all kinds of deputations and of\r\ntroubled individuals seeking advice on every subject under the sun. He\r\nwas a court of appeal in family troubles as well as on public questions.\r\n\r\nA small girl came to the door one night with the announcement:\r\n\r\n\"If you please, father's took to drink again, and mother says will Mr.\r\nCrooks come round and give him a good hiding?\"\r\n\r\nAppeals like that of an old labourer who could neither read nor write\r\nbecame common. The old man stood sobbing on the step without a word when\r\nCrooks's youngest daughter opened the door. Instinct told her it was her\r\nfather that was wanted, and she called him.\r\n\r\n\"Well, old Charley, what's the matter now?\" when Crooks recognised his\r\ncaller.\r\n\r\n\"She's turned me out again,\" came the words between sobs. \"If you would\r\non'y go and speak to her, Mr. Crooks, and put in a word for me! She\r\nain't half a bad wife, you know. It's on'y her temper and me as don't\r\nagree.\"\r\n\r\nHe invited the aggrieved husband inside, going off himself alone, to\r\nreturn in half an hour with the news that the road was now clear.\r\n\r\nAbout a month later in the main road he was hailed from over the way.\r\nThe old labourer came hobbling towards him.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Mr. Crooks, I don't know what yer said to my ole woman that night,\r\nbut she's bin a perfect angel since.\"\r\n\r\nWhat Crooks had said was simple enough. On reaching the court he found\r\nthe good wife gossiping.\r\n\r\n\"Here's Mr. Crooks!\" cried the little company of women as he approached.\r\n\r\nHe spoke no word, but with a mysterious air beckoned the aggressive wife\r\naside.\r\n\r\n\"Heard the news about your old man?\" he asked with a long face.\r\n\r\nAssuming the worst, she immediately began to weep into her apron.\r\n\r\n\"It's my fault, Mr. Crooks,\" she whimpered. \"He often threatened to\r\ndrown hisself, but I never thought he'd go and do it!\"\r\n\r\nAnd then again, amid broken sobs:--\"I've al'ays bin a good wife to him,\r\nMr. Crooks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know you have; and he knows it, too. He's often told me what a\r\nsplendid wife you are. But you shouldn't cheek him so. You take my\r\nadvice and coax him a little; coax him, and then you'll find you can do\r\nwhat you like with him afterwards. Why, bless you, if it hadn't been for\r\nsome of us he might have drowned himself to-night. Now you just give him\r\na good supper, like a sensible woman, when we send him home, and begin\r\ncoaxing him from this very night. And, mind, not a word about this to\r\nanyone, for fear you excite him again.\"\r\n\r\nWhen again he met the old labourer it was evident the good relations\r\nwere growing.\r\n\r\n\"Give her a treat last Saturday afternoon, Mr. Crooks--a fair knock-out.\r\nTook her for a 'bus ride to Ludgit Circis, and showed her the Thames\r\nEmbankmint. Never seen anyfink so fine in all her life. Nearly made her\r\nfaint. When she got home she dropped into a chair and said, 'I feel I\r\ncould die now, Charlie, after that.'\"\r\n\r\n\"And you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I said, 'If you talk like that I'll go for Mr. Crooks again.' That\r\nfetched her round, 'pon me honour.\"\r\n\r\nThe good people of Poplar expect Crooks to meet all their needs. It was\r\nnot very inspiring to be knocked up in the middle of the night and find\r\na carman groaning at the door.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Will, I'm that bad with the spasms!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you go to the doctor?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've bin to him and he ain't done me no good. I thought as how if\r\nyou'd come along with me he'd be sure to give me the right stuff.\"\r\n\r\nLater in the same week the man's wife arrived breathless in the early\r\nmorning. \"Would Mr. Crooks come at once?\"\r\n\r\n\"What's happened now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dick took a drop too much at the 'Ship' last night, and when he come\r\nin, me having gone to bed, he mistook the paraffin oil bottle for his\r\nmedicine. Two whole spoonfuls he took, Mr. Crooks, and we've only found\r\nit out this morning. He says he must see you now afore he dies.\"\r\n\r\nCurious ideas are held as to what Crooks's duties are. One irate citizen\r\ndeclared to his mates that he was done with Will Crooks for ever. He was\r\nappealed to for the reason.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" said he, \"there's our sink bin stopped up nigh on three weeks,\r\nand he ain't bin round yet!\"\r\n\r\nAll who labour and are poor in Poplar look upon Crooks as the unfailing\r\nfriend. The coal-man crying coals in the street all in vain, one morning\r\nhails him in passing:--\r\n\r\n\"Wot's wrong with people this morning, Mr. Crooks? One would think I was\r\nselling tombstones!\"\r\n\r\nAnother day it is the chimney-sweep who stops him.\r\n\r\n\"Talk about the County Council's schools in Poplar, Mr. Crooks; I calls\r\nit a scandal, I does.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sending their chimbleys up to Bethnal Green to be swept instead of\r\nemploying local labour!\"\r\n\r\nThe callers at his house were in no sense confined to his neighbours.\r\nOne day it would be C. B. Fry, the cricketer, another day G. K.\r\nChesterton the critic--neither of them for the first time; and again\r\nGeorge R. Sims, Beerbohm Tree, Lord and Lady Denbigh, Miss Gertrude\r\nTuckwell, Father Adderley, Bernard Shaw, Earl Carrington, and the Rev.\r\nCharles Sheldon from the United States--to mention but a few of the men\r\nand women of widely different walks of life who are pleased to number\r\nhim among their friends.\r\n\r\nMr. Sheldon called soon after the great boom of \"In His Steps.\" On\r\nseveral occasions Crooks piloted him through the slums of the East End.\r\nWhile looking round a typical court the American minister asked one of\r\nthe women when they had seen a parson there.\r\n\r\nThe answer came, \"We ain't seen no parson down here since we lived here,\r\nfifteen years.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't wonder that people are bad,\" remarked Mr. Sheldon to Crooks.\r\n\"The wonder is that people are so good as they are.\"\r\n\r\nBefore returning to America Mr. Sheldon sent Crooks a parting note,\r\nending, \"I shall always remember you as you stand, 'in the thick of it,'\r\nfor the rights of little children and brother men.\"\r\n\r\nOutsiders who visit Crooks find him precisely the same man as his\r\nneighbours find him. He has personal friends in the Peers' House as well\r\nas in the Poor's House, but his manner changes not in the company of\r\neither.\r\n\r\nThis characteristic trait in Crooks led Mr. Chesterton, in his book on\r\n\"Charles Dickens,\" into an instructive comparison:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     The English democracy is the most humorous democracy in the world.\r\n     The Scotch democracy is the most dignified, while the whole\r\n     _abandon_ and satiric genius of the English populace come from its\r\n     being quite undignified in every way. A comparison of the two types\r\n     might be found, for instance, by putting a Scotch Labour leader\r\n     like Mr. Keir Hardie alongside an English Labour leader like Mr.\r\n     Will Crooks. Both are good men, honest and responsible and\r\n     compassionate, but we can feel that the Scotchman carries himself\r\n     seriously and universally, the Englishman personally and with an\r\n     obstinate humour. Mr. Keir Hardie wishes to hold up his head as\r\n     Man, Mr. Crooks wishes to follow his nose as Crooks. Mr. Keir\r\n     Hardie is very like a poor man in Walter Scott. Mr. Crooks is very\r\n     like a poor man in Dickens.\r\n\r\n\r\nA little incident bears out Mr. Chesterton to the letter. While Crooks\r\nwas showing a party of titled people at their request round some of the\r\ndark corners of Poplar he was greeted as usual by all the children\r\nplaying in the streets. Seizing the blackest of them he presented the\r\nyoungster to one of the ladies of the party, a well-known peeress.\r\n\r\n\"If this little chap,\" said he, \"was as clean as I could wash him and as\r\nwell dressed as you could dress him, what difference would there be\r\nbetween him and a little prince?\"\r\n\r\nAfter the party had finished their round of inspection somebody\r\nsuggested tea.\r\n\r\n\"It's no use looking for swell tea shops in Poplar,\" said Crooks. \"But\r\nif you care to come with me, my wife will just be getting tea ready for\r\nthe children coming home from school, and no doubt we can find a corner\r\nfor you at the same table.\"\r\n\r\nAnd straightway he led them to Northumberland Street and into his own\r\nhouse without warning, where they shared with the children at the deal\r\ntable in the kitchen.\r\n\r\nSometimes for whole weeks together in the black days of distress he\r\ncould never finish his breakfast without being called to the door to\r\nadvise an out-of-work man or some sorrow-laden woman, or to deal with\r\nsome case of starvation that brooked no delay.\r\n\r\nOf course he often defied the laws of political economy. That is\r\nsometimes the only way to prevent people dying from want. A learned\r\nprofessor of political economy, whose name I am not at liberty to\r\nmention, was converted to some part at least of Crooks's view in a\r\nsingle morning. The Professor called on him during a winter of hard\r\ntimes, and Crooks showed him how some of his neighbours were living.\r\n\r\n\"Hunger we can sometimes stand, 'cos we gets used to it,\" they heard\r\nfrom one woman, surrounded in her bare tenement by lean and shivering\r\nbabies; \"but to be frozen with cold on the top of the hunger--that's the\r\nthing that makes yer squirm, guv'nor--ain't it, Mr. Crooks?\"\r\n\r\nThen the Labour man led the Professor to a slum court. On the muddy\r\nground in the far corner a woman sat weeping.\r\n\r\n\"She ain't been living here long, Mr. Crooks,\" volunteered another woman\r\nfrom her doorstep. \"Her husband's no work, and this morning she were\r\na-sending her four children to school without a bite, so I calls 'em in\r\nhere, and shared out wot we was having for breakfast.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what was that?\" asked the Professor.\r\n\r\nThe woman seemed to resent the question from a well-dressed stranger.\r\n\r\n\"It weren't ham and eggs,\" she said, curtly.\r\n\r\n\"Tell my friend here what you gave them, Mrs. B----\" Crooks requested.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's just like this here, Mr. Crooks,\" she said apologetically.\r\n\"My man's out of work hisself, and we on'y had one loaf, so I cuts it up\r\nbetween her children and mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why is she crying now?\"\r\n\r\n\"She ain't been used to it like some of us, and it's all along of her\r\nwondering where the children's next meal is a-coming from.\"\r\n\r\nAs the two men came away, \"I'm proud of the poor,\" said Crooks. \"And I\r\ndeclare it's a dirty insult for outsiders to say that these people are\r\ndegraded by the feeble efforts I make as a Guardian to give bread to the\r\nhungry. It's nothing to what they do for each other. That woman sharing\r\nher last loaf with another woman's children is typical of what you'll\r\nfind in every street and corner of Poplar where the pinch of hunger is\r\nfelt.\"\r\n\r\nThe Professor walked on silently.\r\n\r\n\"What are we to do for them?\" resumed the Labour man. \"Sometimes people\r\nas badly off as these we have just seen come to my house in the early\r\nmorning, begging me as a Guardian to give their children bread before\r\nthey send them to school. Sometimes they bring their children with them\r\nas though to prove by their hungry eyes the truth of what they tell me.\r\n\r\n\"And I say to them, 'You shouldn't come to me; you should go to the\r\nrelieving officer.'\"\r\n\r\n\"And they reply, 'But what are you Guardians for? We've been to the\r\nMayor, and he refers us to the Guardians. We go to the Guardians, and\r\nthey refer us to the relieving officer. We go to the relieving officer,\r\nand he tells us to attend the relief committee. We inquire about the\r\nrelief committee, and find it doesn't meet for two or three days.\r\nMeanwhile, what are our children to do for bread?'\r\n\r\n\"Do you think,\" Crooks went on to ask the Professor, \"that I can finish\r\nmy own breakfast, or that any other man could with a spark of feeling in\r\nhim, after being called to the door to listen to these pleadings morning\r\nafter morning? Do you think, after these daily experiences, that I care\r\nhow the outside public and the Press attack us because we as Guardians\r\ndare to spend public money in saving these people from starvation?\r\n\r\n\"What is a Board of Guardians to do, with its awful responsibilities and\r\nits awful obligations, during such distressful winters as Poplar\r\nsometimes witnesses? Remember, we Guardians live among the poor. We are\r\nnot carriage folk who can return to the West End and talk about the poor\r\nover dinners of a dozen courses. What else can we do but try to keep the\r\nbodies and souls of these poor people together in times of trade\r\ndepression and cold weather?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST WORKING-MAN MAYOR IN LONDON\r\n\r\n     Elected Mayor of Poplar--\"No Better than a Working-man\"--Shouted\r\n     Down at the Mansion House--The Lord Mayor Defends Him--Refusing a\r\n     Salary--Slums and Fair Rent Courts--Fighting the Public-House\r\n     Interests--Crying not for the Moon, but for the Sun.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn November, 1901, Crooks was chosen to be Mayor of Poplar. In this, as\r\nin all his public offices, he was not the seeker, but the sought-after.\r\nOf the many public positions he has filled, not one has come of his own\r\nseeking. It has always been at the earnest solicitation of others that\r\nhe has gone into office. Moreover, the request in every instance but one\r\nhas come from working-men.\r\n\r\nThe proposal to put him forward for Mayor was made to him before he had\r\nbeen a member of the Poplar Borough Council many months. The Labour\r\nParty was barely half a dozen strong on the Council, so that even with\r\nthe support of the Progressives it was extremely doubtful whether he\r\ncould command a majority of votes. This he pointed out in reply to his\r\nparty's entreaties. Since his arguments were all unavailing, he agreed\r\nat last to be nominated, making one very emphatic condition. That\r\ncondition was, that were he elected there should be no talk of paying\r\nthe Mayor a salary.\r\n\r\nAny of the London Borough Councils can vote a salary to the Mayor, and\r\nin some of the boroughs £300 and £500 a year was being paid. Crooks felt\r\nhe could better retain the confidence of his neighbours, and better meet\r\nthe criticisms of opponents, by refusing a Mayoral grant entirely.\r\nBesides making this the condition of his nomination, he influenced the\r\nBorough Council, some few days before the Mayor was to be elected, to\r\npass a resolution declining to pay a salary.\r\n\r\nOn the night the new Mayor was elected there were some curious scenes\r\nboth inside and outside the Municipal Buildings. To be Mayor in\r\nCoronation Year seemed to be the desire of half the public men in the\r\nkingdom. There were several aspirants in Poplar, and when the number was\r\nreduced to two, Crooks's name was one of them.\r\n\r\nTwice amid the greatest tension in the crowded Council Chamber the\r\nvoting on the two names resulted in a tie. Twice the retiring Mayor\r\nappealed to the Council to come to a decision without his casting vote.\r\nSince nothing would alter the equality of the votes, the Mayor finally\r\nhit upon the device of writing both names on separate slips of paper and\r\ndrawing one at random from a covered bowl.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the tension had become too much for some burly working-men in\r\nthe public gallery. They could be heard blubbering. When you looked up\r\nyou saw them mopping their grimy faces with red-spotted handkerchiefs\r\nor the ends of their scarfs.\r\n\r\nThese men, with many of their mates, had crowded into the Council\r\nChamber on their way home from the engineering yards and railway goods\r\nsidings in Millwall and from all the neighbouring docks. Those who could\r\nnot get inside formed a dense crowd in the streets below. As the news\r\nwas brought out from time to time, how two ballots had been taken and\r\nthe votes were still equal, a silence strange and solemn fell upon the\r\nmassed crowds surging round the Municipal Buildings in the lamp-lighted\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\nSoon the silence gave way to a roar of working-men's voices.\r\n\r\n\"Crooks has got it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Our Will's made Mayor!\"\r\n\r\n\"God bless the Mayor!\"\r\n\r\nAmong that rough-jacketed company could be seen men falling on each\r\nother's necks. And as they streamed homeward in all directions the\r\nstreets of Poplar echoed with the cry that lingered far into the night,\r\n\"Will Crooks is Mayor!\"\r\n\r\nHe was the first Labour Mayor in London. As such he did not make the\r\nmistake of trying to fill the office like the ordinary middle-class man.\r\nHe faced all the world essentially as a working-man Mayor. He showed how\r\nwell a workman can carry out the administrative and ceremonial duties\r\ninseparable from the office. In doing that he dispelled for ever the old\r\nillusion that only men of means can become mayors.\r\n\r\n\"What d'yer think?\" he overheard a tradesman's wife ask another in\r\ndisgust. \"They've made that common fellow Crooks Mayor! And he no better\r\nthan a working-man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite right, madam,\" he interposed, raising his hat as she turned\r\nround, crimson, and recognised him. \"No better than a working-man!\"\r\n\r\nIt was evident, too, that at first certain of the other metropolitan\r\nmayors thought him a common fellow, far beneath their notice. The first\r\noccasion that saw him in their midst was a conference of mayors at the\r\nMansion House. It was convened by the Lord Mayor to consider\r\narrangements for the Coronation Dinner to the Poor. Crooks listened for\r\nan hour to all kinds of suggestions put forward by men who knew little\r\nabout the poor before rising at last to make a proposal of his own.\r\n\r\nThe instant he rose there was a howl of disapproval.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down--sit down!\" \"Who are you?\" \"We want none of your opinions.\"\r\n\"Sit down--sit down!\"\r\n\r\nThe wrath of some of these funny little functionaries at the idea of a\r\nLabour man daring to address them was something he laughed at for a long\r\ntime after. Several of them had lost their heads entirely at being\r\ninvited to discuss a matter which so closely concerned the King and\r\nQueen. The very presence of a Labour man at such an august gathering was\r\nfelt to be an insult.\r\n\r\nThey drowned his voice each time he attempted to speak, until it began\r\nto dawn upon them that instead of gaining favour with the Lord Mayor,\r\nwho was in the chair, they were incurring his displeasure.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" he cried, \"I protest against this conduct. I call upon _my\r\nfriend_, Mr. Crooks, to speak.\"\r\n\r\nYou should have seen their faces then! They had forgotten that the Lord\r\nMayor (Sir Joseph Dimsdale) and Crooks had been colleagues together for\r\nyears on the County Council.\r\n\r\nHaving got a hearing, the Labour man spoke evidently very much to the\r\npoint. Sir Thomas Lipton, who represented the King at that and the\r\nsubsequent conferences, declared afterwards that the one mayor in London\r\nwho seemed to know what was wanted was the working-man Mayor of Poplar.\r\nAt any rate, the final arrangements for the King's Dinner were left to a\r\nsmall sub-committee, of which Crooks was unanimously elected one by the\r\nbody that first tried to howl him down.\r\n\r\nThe illusion that working-men cannot make mayors died hard. It lingered\r\nlast in the columns of the _Times_. Crooks had been in office several\r\nmonths when that journal called public attention to the fact that the\r\nMayor of Poplar lived in a house \"only rated at £11 a year.\" From this\r\ncircumstance the _Times_ drew the rash conclusion that a man so poor\r\ncould not necessarily fill the office of mayor properly.\r\n\r\nAfter this, nobody could be surprised at the wild mis-statements that\r\nfollowed. The _Times_ went on to say that before Crooks's election the\r\nLabour Party of Poplar seemed to think his income of £3 10s. a week\r\ninsufficient for the mayoralty, and that they started a movement \"in\r\nfavour of paying future mayors of the borough a salary at the rate of\r\nfrom £500 to £1,000 a year.\"\r\n\r\nHow completely the facts tell a different story has already appeared.\r\nWhat movement there was in Poplar for paying a salary originated with\r\nthe previous mayor, Mr. R. H. Green, a large employer of labour. Mr.\r\nGreen did not wish for a salary himself, being a man of means; he was\r\nonly anxious that his colleagues should understand that he favoured the\r\nprinciple. His successor, the Labour man, was equally anxious his\r\ncolleagues should understand that he did not favour payment.\r\n\r\nThe real facts were placed before the _Times_, but although its original\r\nmis-statements were copied into several other newspapers and led the\r\n_St. James's Gazette_ to publish a foolish leader on the subject, the\r\n_Times_ offered neither an explanation as to how it fell into its\r\nculpable error nor an apology for its amazing exhibition of bad taste.\r\n\r\nIn reality, his position as Mayor was strengthened by his refusal to\r\ntake a salary. He stated in an interview in the _Daily Telegraph_\r\ntowards the end of his year of office:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     I have only had to do what I have done in every other position I\r\n     have held--let people understand that I have nothing to give away.\r\n     Since my position has become generally known people have let me\r\n     alone, except when I get an appeal like this one--to support a\r\n     football club as a lover of British sports and pastimes. Nobody\r\n     seems to think the worse of me for refusing.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the last, however, he was not forgiven by many people for daring to\r\nbe poor. A worthy lady at a church sewing-party in a London suburb\r\nbecame very indignant at the mention of the name of the Labour Mayor of\r\nPoplar. One of the members present--to whom I am indebted for the\r\nincident--happened to make an incidental reference to Crooks. \"It's a\r\nshame, I say, to let such people be made important,\" cried the good lady\r\nwith much feeling, stopping for a moment her work of making garments for\r\nthe church bazaar. \"Look how they interfere with business. My husband\r\nused to get fifteen per cent. from his Poplar property before they made\r\nthat man Crooks Mayor. Now, what with being compelled to spend so much\r\non repairs and new drains, it's as much as he can do to get ten per\r\ncent.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Crooks heard of the incident, he said he had little doubt the\r\nhusband was an ordinary decent man who invested in poor property,\r\nbecause, as house investment agencies sometimes state in their\r\nadvertisements, it pays better than any other kind.\r\n\r\n\"Probably he is one of that large class who leave the collection of the\r\nrents and all control to agents. That is why slum property has paid so\r\nwell in the past. It has been neglected. Nothing has been spent on\r\nordinary repairs. Whatever expense we as a Municipal Council may put the\r\nowners to in order to make their property healthy, is strictly regulated\r\nby law. We cannot go beyond the letter of the law. The reason why\r\ninvestors in slum property have reaped such a rich harvest in the past\r\nis because neither they nor the local authorities have carried out the\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n\"No man with ordinary sentiment can own slum property and collect his\r\nown rents. A flint-hearted agent generally has control. I know such a\r\none well. If the tenant does not pay up by Saturday he waits and watches\r\nround the corner on Sunday morning. As soon as he sees the wife turn out\r\nto buy a piece of meat or a few vegetables from a coster's stall for\r\nSunday's dinner, he pounces down on her and demands her few pence on\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n\"It's so easy to run away from responsibility by simply saying, 'This is\r\na mere investment, and I am not concerned with the tenants.'\r\n\r\n\"A very wealthy man who owns a lot of small houses in Poplar had his\r\nattention called to the hardship inflicted by the heavy increase in\r\nrents. He was told that a widow whose rent had just been doubled would\r\nhave to seek parish relief if the new demand were enforced. 'My dear\r\ngood fellow,' said the owner, 'I leave these matters to my agent. I\r\ndon't want the woman's money. Look here,' pulling a handful of\r\nsovereigns out of his pocket. 'Why should I care about the woman's rent?\r\nI leave these trifles to my agent, and never interfere.'\r\n\r\n\"Can you wonder that so many of our people are driven to drink and\r\nimmorality?\" Crooks went on after telling this incident. \"Sweated as\r\nthey are for rent in this way, they begin to live in an unholy state of\r\novercrowding. House speculators, Jewish and English, gamble with the\r\npeople's homes. Nearly every time a house changes hands the rent is\r\nraised. The overcrowding is thus made worse than ever. The family living\r\nin three rooms takes two. The family in two rooms pushes its furniture\r\ncloser together and goes into one.\r\n\r\n\"Surely something should be done by the State to prevent this gambling\r\nwith poor people's rents. I would like to see Fair Rent Courts, where\r\nthe rents could be fixed in fair proportion to the value of the house.\r\nSomething of the kind has been done in Ireland; why not in England?\r\n\r\n\"One thing is certain: the more crowded the home is, the more convenient\r\nbecomes the public-house, with its welcome light and deceptive\r\ncheerfulness tempting the wretched. Of course, in theory it is easy to\r\nargue that the poorer the man the more reason there is that he should\r\nnot place in the publican's till the money that ought to be spent on\r\nfood. I fear few of us would retain the moral courage to resist if we\r\nhad to eat, live, and sleep in the same room, sometimes in the company\r\nof a corpse for several days.\"\r\n\r\nProperty owners were not alone in their opposition to the Labour Mayor.\r\nThe publicans almost in a body were ranged against him. Nor was this\r\nonly because of his uncompromising attack on the drink interests as\r\nsuch. It was mainly because he insisted on public-houses being rated on\r\nthe same principle as the grocer's shop or the working-man's\r\ndwelling-house.\r\n\r\nFor several years before his mayoralty he had been Chairman of the\r\nPoplar Assessment Committee. He found that while small tradesmen and\r\nhouseholders were rated to the full market value of their shops and\r\ndwellings, public-houses were very much under-assessed. He therefore\r\npersuaded the Committee, in face of all that the publicans said and\r\nthreatened, to raise their assessments to the proper scale. The\r\npublicans brought the whole strength of their organisation against him,\r\nbriefing counsel in appeals and subsidising opposition candidates at the\r\nlocal elections. This kind of thing had no fears for Crooks. His policy\r\nprevailed.\r\n\r\nSorely though the problem of housing vexed him, he rarely came away from\r\na slum visit without some instance of quaint humour. On one occasion he\r\nwas called into a tenement when the woman told him to mind the hole in\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you ask the landlord to repair it?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I did tell him about it,\" she answered in despair, \"but he only said,\r\n'What! the floor fallen in? Why, you must have been walking on it!'\"\r\n\r\nHe feels keenly that we are allowing the English working-class home to\r\nbe broken up by the gambling of speculators. By the time the gamblers\r\nare finished, it will be found they have broken more than the poor man's\r\nhome. It will be found they have broken the English race.\r\n\r\nThe cost to the municipality of preventing the existence of slums is\r\nsmall, he maintains, compared with the cost to the Poor Law authority of\r\ndealing with the human wreckage that slums create. He brought out this\r\nfact in a striking way in a paper he read before the Central Poor Law\r\nConference at the Guildhall. His subject was \"Pauperism and\r\nOvercrowding.\" He estimated from a study of the official returns that\r\novercrowding and insanitation in the homes of the poor threw an\r\nadditional expenditure on the Poor Law every year in London of about\r\n£134,000. He obtained this figure by estimating the number of people\r\nforced into workhouse infirmaries or requiring the outside attendance of\r\nthe parish doctor owing to sickness solely caused by slumdom.\r\n\r\nAs regards the inmates of public asylums, he showed that London was\r\ninvolved in a still heavier yearly outlay. The number of such inmates\r\nper thousand inhabitants of London varied from 1.9 in the healthy\r\ndistricts to 10.1 in the overcrowded districts. The mean rate was 4.7.\r\nThe numbers above this mean rate were all found in the slum quarters. By\r\nadding them up he arrived at a total of 2,700 people who were forced\r\ninto asylums as the results of ill-housing. It cost London £70,000 a\r\nyear to maintain this number in asylums. He further argued that an\r\nadditional sum of half a million sterling must be put down as\r\nrepresenting the cost of providing the necessary asylum accommodation\r\nfor these 2,700 inmates, the creation of our slums.\r\n\r\n\"So if the public refuse to spend a few hundreds on improving the homes\r\nand conditions of the poor, they are compelled to spend tens of\r\nthousands after the slums have robbed their denizens of health and\r\nreason. I know some of the poor do not live the cleanest and best lives.\r\nThey live down to their environment. And if we don't improve the\r\nenvironment, then, apart from all the higher considerations, we are\r\npenalised for our neglect by having to pay for their care and keep in\r\nasylums and infirmaries.\r\n\r\n\"We Labour men are sometimes accused of crying for the moon. No; we are\r\ncrying for the sun, and before we are finished we mean to get a little\r\nmore sun into the homes and hearts of the people.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE KING'S DINNER--AND OTHERS\r\n\r\n     A Dinner to the Labour Mayor--The Mayoress--The King's Twenty-five\r\n     Thousand Guests--The Prince and Princess of Wales at\r\n     Poplar--Organising a Coronation Treat for Children--A Little Girl's\r\n     Thanks--At the Lord Mayor's Banquet in a Blue Serge Suit--The Mayor\r\n     of Poplar's Carriage at St. Paul's--A Testimonial on Quitting\r\n     Office.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the Labour Mayor was debarred by what he called his \"chronic want\r\nof wealth\" from entertaining at his own expense, the Poplar Labour\r\nLeague decided to entertain him at a dinner on their own part by way of\r\ncommemorating his election. Directly the project was talked about,\r\nfriends of his of all classes expressed a wish to attend.\r\n\r\nThe dinner was given on January 11th, 1902. An old Chartist was in the\r\nchair, Mr. Nathan Robinson, one of the Mayor's colleagues on the London\r\nCounty Council. Lord Monkswell sat at the same table with stevedores and\r\ngas-workers. Some of the Mayor's fellow-workers on the Asylums Board\r\nfraternised with some of the Mayor's fellow-workers on the Labour\r\nLeague. Nearly every trade and every church in Poplar were represented.\r\nDean Lawless of the Roman Catholics, the Rev. Mr. Nairn of the\r\nPresbyterians, and Father Dolling of the Anglicans, sat at meat together\r\nfor the first time in their lives, drawn by the engaging personality of\r\nthe Labour Mayor.\r\n\r\n\"I must just write a word of congratulation on our dinner of Saturday,\"\r\nwrote Dolling from St. Saviour's Clergy House a couple of days later. \"I\r\nthink it was just splendid. It is given to few men to gain the respect,\r\nconfidence, and esteem--I might say the affection--of friends and foes,\r\ncolleagues and opponents. God grant you strength and perseverance.\"\r\n\r\nThe same spirit breathed through a letter from the Roman Catholic\r\nDean:--\"God bless you and God speed you; and also your gentle wife, the\r\nMayoress.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Crooks, by the way, filled the office of Mayoress with a quiet\r\ndignity and grace that won everyone's regard. As her husband stood\r\nprimarily as a working-man Mayor, she too as Mayoress made no pretence\r\nat being other than a working-man's wife. She could be seen cleaning her\r\nown doorstep as housewife in the morning and taking part in some public\r\nfunction as Mayoress in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe day the appointment was announced a journalist from an evening paper\r\nwent down to Poplar, hoping evidently to find the new Mayoress greatly\r\nelated. He seemed surprised to find her so busy in the kitchen preparing\r\nthe children's dinner that she had barely time to grant him the\r\ninterview he sought.\r\n\r\n\"Why should you think it would make any difference to us?\" she asked\r\nhim, with natural simplicity. \"Dad will just be the same plain and\r\ncheery Will Crooks that he has always been. Of course, we'll do our best\r\nas Mayor and Mayoress, but it will simply be as ordinary\r\nworking-people.\"\r\n\r\nWith perfect self-possession and a modest, dignified bearing, which\r\nremained the same when she was receiving the Prince and Princess of\r\nWales as when attending a conference of working women, Mrs. Crooks\r\ncarried out her duties as Mayoress of Poplar and won good opinions on\r\nevery hand.\r\n\r\nThe unbounded pride of the poor in their Mayor was something to\r\nremember. For the first time they became conscious of a personal tie\r\nbetween themselves and a public office that previously had always seemed\r\nfar removed from them. They followed him admiringly. They hovered about\r\nhis door until the Mayoress despaired of keeping the step clean. If they\r\ncould obtain a momentary glimpse of him in his robes and chain, or\r\nbetter still, pass a few words with him, it was something to boast of.\r\nSpeculation as to where he kept the mayoral chain reached the length of\r\none wild suggestion that he put it under his pillow at night.\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday morning that the Mayor and Council went in state to the\r\nparish church, nearly all Poplar turned out to honour the occasion. The\r\nstreets were lined with spectators as for a royal pageant. Work-people\r\nalone would have filled the spacious church of All Saints four or five\r\ntimes over could they have obtained admission.\r\n\r\nEven the children at the Poor Law school at Forest Gate, four miles\r\naway, joined in the chorus of congratulations.\r\n\r\n\"The boys and girls here have toasted your election as Mayor with cheers\r\nthat you might almost have heard at Poplar,\" wrote the superintendent.\r\n\"We all feel that in a way we have some share in your new dignity.\"\r\n\r\nCoronation year was a busy year for the London mayors. Crooks, who had a\r\ngreat share in organising the King's Dinner to the Poor of the whole of\r\nLondon, carried through the local arrangements in Poplar for feeding\r\ntwenty-five thousand without a hitch. It is notorious that the\r\ndeplorable muddle which marked the dinner arrangements in some of the\r\nWest End boroughs brought a Royal request to the mayors for an\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nThe King had made known his intention to visit Poplar during the dinner.\r\nIt is known how his illness prevented him from leaving Buckingham Palace\r\non the memorable Saturday. The Prince and Princess of Wales, on behalf\r\nof the King, attended the two or three centres he had arranged to visit.\r\nMuch to the consternation of metropolitan mayors in wealthier districts,\r\nwho were competing among themselves to secure the Royal visitors, the\r\nPrince and Princess went to Poplar.\r\n\r\nThe King's guests, we have seen, numbered twenty-five thousand in Poplar\r\nalone. Of these, three thousand dined under a great awning in the Tunnel\r\nGardens, one of the open spaces Crooks had secured for the borough. The\r\nMayor passed among the motley throng like a benediction, receiving the\r\ngood-natured chaff of the men and their wives concerning his gold-laced\r\nhat and scarlet robe. Only one of the three thousand, a steward, was\r\ninclined to be cantankerous, though not in the Mayor's hearing. Pointing\r\nto Crooks with a carving-knife he said to his companion:--\r\n\r\n\"I wonder he ain't ashamed of himself. Why couldn't we have had a\r\ngentleman for mayor like Morton? I've been a sheriff's officer myself,\r\nand I call it a disgrace to Poplar.\"\r\n\r\nHe changed his tone when the Prince and Princess of Wales arrived and\r\nwere formally received by the Mayor and Mayoress, before going round the\r\ntables, chatting and joking with Crooks.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that takes the cake!\" said the ex-sheriff's officer in amazement.\r\n\"There's the Prince of Wales talking to that fellow Crooks just as\r\nthough he was talking to a gentleman!\"\r\n\r\nLater on the mayors of other London boroughs, chiefly out of their own\r\nprivate purses, gave a special Coronation treat to the children. It\r\nlooked as though the children of Poplar, in the absence of a wealthy\r\nmayor, would receive no such favours.\r\n\r\nCrooks met the need by a public appeal. Nearly £300 was subscribed,\r\nchiefly by local employers and residents, enabling the Mayor to\r\nentertain about eight thousand children. Some five thousand were divided\r\namong four garden parties. Infants to the number of three thousand were\r\nentertained at their own schools. All the crippled children in the\r\nborough were taken in brakes to Epping Forest for the day.\r\n\r\nA couple of days later Crooks received through the post an unsigned\r\nletter in a child's large round hand-writing. This is what it said:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     All the little boys and girls in our school want to thank you for\r\n     the very nice party we had in honour of the King's Coronation. Some\r\n     of us had chocolate and very nice medals, and all the school had\r\n     cakes, lemonade, fruit, sweets, and a little medal. We had sports\r\n     in the playground and prizes for those who won the races. And we\r\n     all enjoyed it very much.\r\n\r\n     Please accept the best thanks from the children of the Infants'\r\n     School, Wade Street.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe tells many amusing stories about the mayoralty. An ardent admirer\r\nchased him over half of Poplar one night, following him from the Town\r\nHall to a chapel bazaar and from the bazaar to a Labour meeting,\r\nguarding carefully under his arm a brown paper parcel. At last he saw\r\nhis chance of getting a private word with the Mayor.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, Will, but I've just heard as how you've been asked to dine\r\nat the Mansion House with all the other mayors. And I thought I'd like\r\nto offer to lend you my ole dress suit. I couldn't abear the thought of\r\nour Mayor not looking as good as the other blokes. 'Tain't much to speak\r\nof, Will\"--unfolding the parcel--\"but perhaps your missus can touch it\r\nup a bit.\"\r\n\r\nCrooks did not go to the City banquet on that occasion. It was not until\r\nthree years later that, on the invitation of Lord Mayor Pounds, he\r\nattended the Ninth of November banquet at the Guildhall. Then he turned\r\nup in his blue serge suit, which, in a way, made him one of the most\r\nconspicuous figures present, since all the other guests were in Court\r\ndress, uniform, or ordinary evening dress. A crowded company in the\r\nreception room broke out into rounds of applause when the Labour man in\r\nhis plain attire walked down the room after being announced. He was\r\nreceived in the most cordial way by the Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress.\r\n\r\nHe had an amusing experience in connection with a State service at St.\r\nPaul's, to which he was invited as Mayor of Poplar.\r\n\r\n\"I took train to the City, and was walking towards the Cathedral when a\r\ncabman from my own district accosted me.\r\n\r\n\"'I say, Mr. Crooks, let me give you a lift up to the Cathedral, so that\r\nI can get a chance to see what's going.'\r\n\r\n\"'All right,' said I; and I got into his cab, and was driven up with as\r\nmuch dignity as the cab and horse could command.\r\n\r\n\"The cabman then rode away and took up his position in waiting. The\r\nservice over, all the titled people crowded out, and there was an eager\r\ndemand for carriages. A stout policeman at the door called out the\r\nnames.\r\n\r\n\"'The Duke of ----'s carriage.' 'The Mayor of Westminster's carriage.'\r\n'Lady ----'s carriage.' And so on, as each swell conveyance rolled up.\r\nThen, when the policeman learnt who I was, he yelled, 'The Mayor of\r\nPoplar's carriage.'\r\n\r\n\"Up drove my cabby with his growler.\r\n\r\n\"'Take that thing away!' shouted the policeman. 'Make room for the\r\nMayor of Poplar's carriage.'\r\n\r\n\"'Who yer getting at?' said cabby mischievously. 'This _is_ the Mayor of\r\nPoplar's carriage.'\r\n\r\n\"'All right, constable,' I said, as I went down the steps; 'that's my\r\ncab.'\r\n\r\n\"The policeman immediately began to apologise. Cabby said he wouldn't\r\nhave missed the fun for fifty quid.\"\r\n\r\nAt the Coronation ceremony at the Abbey, to which all the London mayors\r\nwere invited, Crooks asked to be exempt from wearing Court dress. The\r\nKing sent him the exemption he asked for.\r\n\r\n\"I attended the Abbey in my mayoral robes, and when the ceremony was\r\nover I escaped from the crowd as quickly as I could, and was going to a\r\nhouse near by to take off my robes. I found myself in Dean's Yard, which\r\nwas quiet and almost deserted, save for a few youngsters.\r\n\r\n\"'I say, Tom, here's the King,' I heard one of them remark as I\r\napproached.\r\n\r\n\"'That ain't the King,' said a second youngster; 'that's the Dook of\r\nConnort.'\r\n\r\n\"'Garn! he ain't no royalty!' said another of the lads. And looking up\r\ninto my face, he asked, 'Who is yer, guv'nor?'\r\n\r\n\"The question was more than I could stand, and I had to hurry away\r\nlaughing heartily.\"\r\n\r\nHis year of office was pronounced by opponents and supporters to be a\r\ntriumphant success. From the very first the Labour Mayor proved that he\r\nknew his duties. He had not been in office long before he obtained a\r\ngift of £15,000 for the building of three additional public libraries\r\nfor Poplar. As an administrator he brought about many changes in the\r\nBorough Council's methods of doing work, introducing into the municipal\r\nlife of Poplar something of the business-like methods of the L.C.C.\r\n\r\nHow far his efforts succeeded is shown by the presentation made to him\r\nand Mrs. Crooks at the close of the mayoral year. All parties on the\r\nBorough Council combined in a gift of silver plate to the Mayoress, and\r\nan illuminated address to the Mayor.\r\n\r\n\"Had we only known what a good mayor you would have made, Mr. Crooks,\"\r\nsaid one of the Conservative members, \"we should never have opposed your\r\nelection.\"\r\n\r\nIn thanking his colleagues on behalf of himself and his wife, Crooks\r\nclosed his speech with these words:--\"We are as poor now as when we\r\nbegan, but money cannot buy the satisfaction we possess. We have had\r\nopportunities of being useful, and we have done the best we could with\r\nour opportunities. As I have lived, so I hope to end my days--a servant\r\nof the people.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE MAN WHO PAID OLD AGE PENSIONS\r\n\r\n     Address to the National Committee on Old Age Pensions--Paying\r\n     Pensions through the Poor Law--A Walk from West to East--The Living\r\n     Pension and the Living Wage--Scientific Starvation under\r\n     Bumbledom--Defending the Living Pension at the L.G.B.\r\n     Inquiry--Poplar \"a Shining Light.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWith several other Labour leaders, Crooks was invited to join the\r\nNational Committee on Old Age Pensions that arose out of Mr. Charles\r\nBooth's Conferences at Browning Hall. Mr. Richard Seddon, on his last\r\nvisit to England, described at one of the conferences the New Zealand\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nIt was news to all the members of the Committee to hear Crooks unfold\r\nthe details of a scheme differing largely both from Mr. Booth's and Mr.\r\nSeddon's. It was one that had been forced upon him after much reflection\r\nand experience.\r\n\r\n\"For two or three generations the working classes of this country have\r\nbeen asked to vote for Doodle or Foodle and Old Age Pensions. The\r\nelector of to-day, like his father and grandfather before him, is still\r\nwaiting for the fulfilment of the promise. It seems a vain hope. He,\r\ntoo, like those before him, may die of old age still waiting, perhaps\r\nending his days in the workhouse.\r\n\r\n\"Now I for one have got tired of waiting. I've commenced to pay\r\npensions already. I maintain that it is both lawful, and right to pay\r\npensions through the Poor Law. And I intend to go on paying them, and to\r\nurge others to pay them, until Liberal and Conservative politicians\r\ncease deluding the people by promises and establish a State system.\"\r\n\r\nHe put forward his scheme before many other assemblies. To the argument\r\nthat this is only a system of \"glorified out-relief,\" he makes answer,\r\n\"So are most pensions. At the risk of outraging the feelings of\r\neconomists, I hold that out-relief to the poor is no more degrading than\r\nout-relief to the rich. We hear no talk of endangering the independence\r\nof Cabinet Ministers or of Civil Servants when they are paid old age\r\npensions.\r\n\r\n\"It is argued the poor have the workhouse provided for them. True; but\r\nwas it not Ruskin who pointed out that--\r\n\r\n\r\n     The poor seem to have a prejudice against the workhouse which the\r\n     rich have not; for, of course, everyone who takes a pension from\r\n     Government goes into the workhouse on a grand scale; only the\r\n     workhouses for the rich do not involve the idea of work, and should\r\n     be called playhouses. But the poor like to die independently, it\r\n     appears. Perhaps, if we make the playhouses pretty and pleasant\r\n     enough, or give them their pensions at home, their minds might be\r\n     reconciled to the conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Look down as you may on these veterans of almost endless toil, but\r\ndon't forget they have made our country what it is. They have fought in\r\nthe industrial army for British supremacy in the commercial world and\r\nobtained it. The least their country can do is to honour their old\r\nage.\"\r\n\r\nThe twofold character of Crooks's Poor Law policy has already appeared.\r\nWhile he wants to make life in the workhouse less like life in prison,\r\nhe is also anxious that all worn-out old men and women, who have friends\r\nto look after them, should be kept as far from the workhouse as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\"To do that means the granting of a pension. Call it outdoor relief if\r\nyou like, but at the same time call the Right Honourable Gerald\r\nBalfour's and Lord Eversley's pensions outdoor relief.\r\n\r\n\"At any rate, relief must be on a more generous scale than it usually is\r\nif you are going to keep honourable old people out of the workhouse.\r\nFailing that, out-relief has a tendency to perpetuate sweating. Mr.\r\nChaplin was not alone in deprecating inadequate out-relief. The Aged\r\nPoor Commission, of which the King was a member, reporting in 1895,\r\ncalled attention to the ill-effects of inadequate out-door grants and\r\nsuggested that the amounts be increased.\"\r\n\r\nIn one of our many walks together about the streets of London, I\r\nremember with what animation and depth of feeling he discussed this\r\nsubject. We began somewhere in Westminster with the intention of taking\r\na 'bus at Charing Cross. We found ourselves still walking eastward as we\r\npassed Temple Bar, and then agreed to mount a 'bus at Ludgate Circus. We\r\nwere still on our feet as we went through St. Paul's Churchyard, so\r\ndecided to walk on to the Bank. But he forgot everything but the poor\r\nagain until we stopped our walk for a moment at Aldgate Church. Before a\r\n'bus could arrive he was deep in the subject again, and almost\r\nmechanically resumed walking. And so, on through Whitechapel and Stepney\r\nand Limehouse into Poplar, he discoursed earnestly all the way on the\r\nneed for poor people's pensions.\r\n\r\n\"Since I prefer to call out-relief a pension,\" he said, \"I'm going to\r\nsee that it is a real pension, and not a dole. Inadequate out-relief\r\ngives the sweater his opportunity. A sympathetic half-crown a week to a\r\nworn-out old woman making shirts at ninepence the dozen has the effect\r\nof dragging the struggling young widow with a family of children down to\r\naccepting the same price. It sometimes takes a whole week to earn\r\none-and-six, so little wonder that the pinch of hunger sends many a\r\nyoung widow to the devil. We may preach that the wages of sin is death,\r\nbut life isn't worth living at all to many people. An unknown hell has\r\nno more terrors to them than an awful earth.\r\n\r\n\"How would I stop this? I would stop it by making it impossible for the\r\nold woman to be the unconscious instrument in encompassing the ruin of\r\nthe young woman. The old woman cannot live on a half-crown dole from the\r\nGuardians; so to make a shilling or two more she undercuts the young\r\nwoman, and the sweater gets them both at reduced wages. Now if the old\r\nwoman deserves help at all, the help ought to be sufficient to keep her\r\nwithout the necessity of falling into the sweater's net and dragging\r\nothers with her. The help must be a pension on which she can live. It\r\nought not to be a dole on which she starves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you stand for the Living Pension as well as for the Living Wage?\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely. But nearly all pension schemes, like most out-relief\r\nsystems, fix the allowance at a starvation figure. Sums of four or five\r\nshillings won't save old people from hardship. For example, we have in\r\nthe Poplar workhouse old pensioners who received as much as six\r\nshillings a week. They found they couldn't live outside on that, and so\r\nhad no alternative but the House. Only the other day there was another\r\nsix-shilling pensioner admitted to the House. He had struggled on\r\noutside in his one room, selling and pawning his few things bit by bit\r\nto eke out a living until he hadn't a stick left. So, although receiving\r\na pension of six shillings a week, he was forced into the workhouse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you find the same thing happening in regard to old people assisted\r\nby a friendly society or a trade union?\"\r\n\r\n\"Occasionally we do,\" answered Crooks. \"The other day, for instance, a\r\nsuperannuated trade unionist came before the Board, an old man blunt in\r\nspeech and not without independence.\r\n\r\n\"'We understand you have a pension of six shillings a week,' says the\r\nChairman.\r\n\r\n\"'That's all right, guv'nor. But how could you pay three shillings a\r\nweek out of that for the rent of our one room and then you and the wife\r\nlive on the rest?'\r\n\r\n\"Take another case,\" resumed Crooks as we crossed Commercial Road. \"A\r\nfine-looking old woman enters the relief committee room, scrupulously\r\nclean but poorly clad--a splendid specimen of a self-respecting\r\nhonourable old English woman.\r\n\r\n\"'Now, my good woman, what can we do for you?'\r\n\r\n\"'Well, sir, we've nothing left in the world, and I've come to see if\r\nyou can assist us?'\r\n\r\n\"'Where's your husband?'\r\n\r\n\"'He's ill in bed to-day. He's turned seventy-three. I'm seventy-five\r\nmyself. We've been living on his club money until now. He had six\r\nmonths' full pay and six months' half-pay. That's as much as the club\r\nallows. Now we've got nothing. He worked up to a little more than a year\r\nago; At seventy-three he can't work any longer.'\r\n\r\n\"'We are very sorry,' says the Chairman, 'but the Poor Law practice is\r\nto ask old people like you to come into the workhouse.'\r\n\r\n\"'Anything but that, sir,' pleads the old lady tearfully. 'Both of us\r\nover seventy; we should feel it so much now after working all our lives.\r\nWe can look after ourselves outside if you can give us a little help.'\r\n\r\n\"Here, then, you have an honest, hard-working old couple still faced\r\nwith nothing but the workhouse, although they have been thrifty and done\r\neverything which the political promoters of old-age pensions say ought\r\nto be done. We made full inquiries, and for a time at least we thought\r\nwe would meet their wishes and let them live outside. We gave them six\r\nshillings a week, and watched the case carefully. We saw that to eke out\r\nexistence, one by one their articles of furniture were going. Struggle\r\nand strive as they did on their six shillings a week, they would have\r\nbeen compelled to come into the House ultimately after a few further\r\nstages of this system of scientific starvation if we hadn't found\r\noutside help for them from another quarter.\"\r\n\r\n\"You want, then, to base out-relief, like an old-age pension, on the\r\nLiving Wage principle?\"\r\n\r\n\"No other plan will work. No other plan is just,\" he said in his earnest\r\nway. \"The out-relief ought to be the pension. There are a lot of old\r\npeople receiving out-relief grants of three or four shillings. What is\r\nthe result? They toil and struggle and pine outside on an amount which\r\nbarely keeps body and soul together. They reach the workhouse at last,\r\nas a rule, through the infirmary. That means they break down and have to\r\nget medical orders for admission. It has been proved that thirty per\r\ncent. of the people in Poor Law infirmaries are suffering ailments of\r\nsome kind or other due to want of proper nourishment.\r\n\r\n\"That is what I mean when I say that the present Poor Law, as Bumbledom\r\nwould administer it, has nothing better to prescribe than scientific\r\nstarvation to old people who refuse the House. If one is foolish enough\r\nto grow old without being artful enough to get rich, this world is the\r\nwrong place to be in.\r\n\r\n\"When old age comes to working people, both thrifty and unthrifty have\r\nin most instances to turn to one of two things--precarious charity or\r\nthe Poor Law. Charity is a splendid exercise for many people, but no law\r\nor custom exists compelling its practice. Now the Poor Law can be\r\nenforced; only it has been used to terrorise the poor. The State sets up\r\na system to save old people from starvation, and then allows it to be\r\nused to perpetuate starvation.\r\n\r\n\"It won't do. So long as we have this system, I'm going to make not the\r\nworst use of it, but the best use of it. And I believe in paying old-age\r\npensions through the Poor Law. The Poor Law ought not to degrade any\r\nmore than the Rich Law degrades under which Ministers and officers of\r\nthe State receive their pensions. Why do I say pay pensions through the\r\nPoor Law? Because it is here. It is something to begin with at once. It\r\nis the thin edge of the wedge of a system of universal old-age pensions,\r\nfree and adequate.\"\r\n\r\nPending the adoption of some national system, he practises in Poplar the\r\npolicy he urges in public, that of paying a living pension through the\r\nPoor Law.\r\n\r\nHis policy received unexpected endorsement in a letter sent to him by an\r\nold woman of eighty-three in a provincial town. She wrote to him in the\r\nsummer of 1906 at the time others were attacking him for his policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Your noble efforts on behalf of penniless old people like me I see\r\n     are being condemned in some of the papers. They can't know the\r\n     facts. I was managing very comfortably until the Liberator crash\r\n     took away my income. I started a small school and maintained myself\r\n     until I was seventy. After that I was no good for work. What I\r\n     should have done I don't know had it not been for a few friends\r\n     who, like yourself, believe in out-relief grants of sufficient\r\n     amount to keep a person living; and they persuaded the Guardians to\r\n     help me. I thank you for the fight you are making on behalf of\r\n     hundreds of helpless old people like myself. May the King soon call\r\n     you Sir Will Crooks.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was examined at some length on his Living Pension policy at the Local\r\nGovernment Board Inquiry into the Poplar Guardians' administration. He\r\nadmitted that old people over sixty receiving out-relief in Poplar were\r\ncosting the borough a sixpenny rate.\r\n\r\n\"I say it is wicked to compel us,\" he stated in evidence, \"to maintain\r\nout of our local rates these old people who ought to be a charge--as I\r\nhave said hundreds of times, and repeat--for the whole metropolis or for\r\nthe nation rather than the locality. These industrial veterans are\r\nthrust upon us in Poplar to maintain, notwithstanding that most of the\r\nwealth they created has been enjoyed by people who live elsewhere, and\r\nthus escape their share of the burden of maintaining their old workers\r\nin old age. But because this unjust state of things exists, are we, with\r\na full sense of our responsibility, to tell these broken-down old\r\nworkers that we refuse to bear the burden ourselves, and that they must\r\ndo the best they can?\"\r\n\r\nThen followed a rapid fire of questions and answers between himself and\r\nthe legal representative of the Poplar Municipal Alliance.\r\n\r\n_Q._--Is not that rather a dangerous doctrine? If local authorities\r\ngenerally allowed their sympathies to carry them into acts not\r\ncontemplated by their constitution and their powers, what do you think\r\nthe general result would be?\r\n\r\n_A._--It _is_ contemplated by our constitution. We are here to relieve\r\ndistress. We are created for that purpose.\r\n\r\n_Q._--Do you say there is any machinery or power in the Poor Law which\r\nauthorises you to give allowances which are, in fact, old age pensions\r\nto these people?\r\n\r\n_A._--It allows us to give out-door relief. You can call it what you\r\nlike.... We cannot refuse to give people help and assistance in old age.\r\n\r\n_Q._--I am not quarrelling for a moment with the proposition in the\r\nabstract; I am quarrelling with your method of carrying it out in your\r\nlocal machinery.\r\n\r\n_A._--Tell me what you would do--leave them to starve on the streets?\r\n\r\n_Q._--I suggest, is it not a dangerous doctrine for local authorities to\r\nexceed their statutory powers?\r\n\r\n_A._--I assure you we have never done anything of the kind, and I\r\nchallenge you to prove it.\r\n\r\n_Q._--I ask you to show me any authority for a grant continuously of,\r\nsay, ten shillings a week to these old people?\r\n\r\n_A._--The Local Government Board issued an order dealing with the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nThe Inspector:--You rely on Mr. Chaplin's circular?\r\n\r\n_A._--Yes, with regard to the treatment of the aged and deserving poor.\r\nThat circular reads:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     It has been felt that persons who have habitually led decent and\r\n     deserving lives should, if they require relief in their old age,\r\n     receive different treatment from those whose previous habits and\r\n     character have been unsatisfactory, and who have failed to exercise\r\n     thrift in bringing up their families or otherwise. The Local\r\n     Government Board consider that aged and deserving persons should\r\n     not be urged to enter the workhouse at all unless there is some\r\n     cause which renders such a course necessary, such as infirmity of\r\n     mind or body, the absence of house accommodation, or of a suitable\r\n     person to care for them, or some similar cause; but think they\r\n     should be relieved by giving adequate outdoor relief. The Board are\r\n     happy to think it is commonly the practice of Boards of Guardians\r\n     to grant outdoor relief in such cases, but they are afraid that too\r\n     frequently such relief is not adequate in amount. They are desirous\r\n     of pressing upon the Boards of Guardians that such relief should,\r\n     when granted, be always adequate.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is our authority for what we are doing.... For once in a way one\r\ncan say this Inquiry at least will be an enlightening one.\r\n\r\n_Q._--I hope it will, Mr. Crooks.\r\n\r\n_A._--I am sure it will.\r\n\r\n_Q._--To other places than Poplar?\r\n\r\n_A._--I hope so indeed. Poplar will be a shining light in the days to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nELECTION TO PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\n     Labour Candidate for Woolwich--Lord Charles Beresford describes\r\n     Crooks as a Fair and Square Opponent--How the Election Fund was\r\n     Raised--Crooks recommended by John Burns as \"Wise on Poor\r\n     Law\"--Half-loaf and Whole Loaf--\"Greatest By-election Victory of\r\n     Modern Times.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of February 19th, 1903, the Press stated that\r\nconsiderable excitement was created in London on the previous day by the\r\nannouncement that Lord Charles Beresford had been offered the command of\r\nthe Channel squadron, and that he was about to resign his Parliamentary\r\nseat in Woolwich.\r\n\r\nA few days later the genial admiral, from a public platform, was bidding\r\ngood-bye to his constituents and introducing to them the Conservative\r\ncandidate in the person of Mr. Geoffrey Drage. He took occasion to throw\r\nout the warning that the opposition candidate was a strong man, whom he\r\nknew to be a fair and square opponent.\r\n\r\nThe reference was to Crooks. He had been adopted as Labour candidate\r\nsome few weeks previously. The invitation sent to him by the Woolwich\r\nLabour Representation Association was a unanimous one. It surprised him\r\nto receive it, since his association with Woolwich--on the other side\r\nof the Thames two miles below Poplar--was a very slight one. When he\r\naccepted the invitation it was believed there would be at least two\r\nyears to prepare for the General Election. The Labour candidate had\r\nbarely made his _début_ before the by-election was announced.\r\n\r\nNobody but the little band of Labour men in the constituency believed in\r\nCrooks's chances. The honours had fallen so easily hitherto to the\r\nConservatives. Lord Charles Beresford got the seat without a contest.\r\nSir Edwin Hughes before him was returned unopposed in 1900, while for\r\nsixteen years previously he held the seat by majorities averaging more\r\nthan two thousand. The majority at the previous contest (which took\r\nplace in 1895) reached 2,805.\r\n\r\nFaced with this formidable figure, Crooks entered upon the contest with\r\nall his usual zeal and good humour. There was first the difficulty of\r\nthe election expenses. The Labour Association quickly raised £200 from\r\namong its members. It soon became evident, however, that before the\r\nLabour Party could get in touch with the sixteen thousand voters on the\r\nregister and meet the returning officer's fees, a sum four or five times\r\nas large as that would be needed.\r\n\r\nAn appeal to the public was sent out by the Association, signed by S. H.\r\nGrinling, M.A. (chairman), W. Barefoot (treasurer), and A. Hall\r\n(secretary). The appeal was taken up by the _Daily News_, which opened a\r\nWoolwich Election Fund. In about a fortnight that paper raised £1,000.\r\nContributions poured in from all classes, in every part of the kingdom,\r\naccompanied by a chorus of well-wishes of which any public man might\r\nindeed be proud.\r\n\r\nAs from day to day the amounts were acknowledged in the _Daily News_,\r\none saw side by side with the modest two shillings from \"Four workers\"\r\n£10 from Lord Portsmouth. Among the shillings and sixpences from working\r\nwomen and girls appeared £5 from Lady Trevelyan, and a list of\r\nsubscriptions from Father Adderley, containing one \"From a lady in lieu\r\nof a new hat.\" The day \"Two Chalfont lads\" sent \"a bob each,\" two sums\r\nof £50 were acknowledged from the Right Hon. Sydney Buxton and Mr.\r\nGeorge Cadbury. The authors of \"The Heart of the Empire,\" with a gift of\r\n£25, shared the same spirit with \"A Leominster working-man,\" who\r\nforwarded three shillings, and \"Four working men of Cirencester,\" who\r\nsent four shillings between them. Dr. Clifford, the Rev. Stopford\r\nBrooke, and Canon Scott Holland swelled the list, together with old\r\nLabour Members of Parliament like Mr. T. Burt and Mr. H. Broadhurst.\r\n\r\n\"A fellow worker of Mr. Crooks on the Asylums Board\" was responsible for\r\n£10, while colleagues of his on the London County Council contributed\r\nabout £100 between them.\r\n\r\nFrom Porchester Square came a substantial cheque with an unsigned note\r\nwritten in the third person, to this effect:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     The lady who sends the enclosed is nearly eighty-four, and\r\n     therefore cannot offer any help in person, but she most heartily\r\n     wishes Mr. Crooks success in his brave fight, as she has for a long\r\n     time past desired to see more Labour representatives in the House\r\n     of Commons.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe campaign went on merrily. The magnetic personality of the Labour\r\ncandidate drew to his side every Progressive section in the\r\nconstituency. It was not only that working-men threw themselves into the\r\nfight with Herculean energy, but the temperance societies and the\r\nchurches of nearly every denomination became enthusiastic in his\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nThey seemed to share the same estimate of the candidate as Mr. Keir\r\nHardie, who wrote to the electors describing Crooks as \"a first-class\r\nfighting man, and the best of good fellows, who would, if returned,\r\nbring credit and honour to the constituency.\"\r\n\r\nMr. John Burns went down to Woolwich to pay his tribute in person. With\r\nthe Labour candidate he addressed a mass meeting of over five thousand\r\nelectors in the Drill Hall, while crowds surged outside the doors,\r\ndelaying the tram traffic in the streets. Mr. Burns fell into glowing\r\nperiods in his eulogy of his old colleague:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Woolwich has in Mr. Crooks a man who not only carries a banner\r\n     which typifies a cause, but honours the army for which he works. By\r\n     his tolerance and sweet-tempered geniality, he has united the\r\n     Progressive forces of Woolwich as they have never been united\r\n     before. In securing what is possible to-day, Mr. Crooks never\r\n     forgets his ideal, but with a brotherly love and Christian charity\r\n     pursues the line of least resistance in a way which Labour has not\r\n     always shown.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore sitting down, Mr. Burns took occasion to tell his five thousand\r\nhearers that among other reasons why he was there to commend their\r\ncandidate was because Crooks was \"wise on Poor Law.\"\r\n\r\nAs the contest developed, Crooks found that much the same kind of thing\r\nwas being said against him as he had heard during his mayoralty in\r\nPoplar. He told one of his public meetings:--\r\n\r\n\"Lovely ladies are already going about with lovely stories. As they\r\ncanvass for my opponent they tell the elector or his wife that the rates\r\nwill go up if a Labour candidate is elected. They say that because he is\r\na poor man he will have to be paid a salary of £500 a year out of the\r\nrates. You tell these alluring ladies that Will Crooks has been in\r\npublic life for fourteen years, and has never had a penny from the rates\r\nall the time. Tell them further that if he remains in public life\r\nanother fifty years, he will still never have a penny from the rates.\"\r\n\r\nEvidently those good ladies had not read his election address. There he\r\nstated:--\r\n\r\n\"I have no desire to enter Parliament unless it be for the opportunities\r\nit may afford me of continuing and extending my life's work. If I can\r\nfurther the well-being of my country by assisting in the developing of a\r\nnation of self-respecting men and women, whose children shall be\r\neducated and physically and mentally fitted to face their\r\nresponsibilities and duties, I shall be content.\r\n\r\n\"I therefore ask those of you who believe that the greatness of our\r\nEmpire rests on the happiness and prosperity of its people to consider\r\ncarefully the importance of the present election.\r\n\r\n\"I am of opinion that a strong Labour Party in the House of Commons,\r\ncomprised of men who know the sufferings and share the aspirations of\r\nall grades of workmen, is certain to exercise greater influence for good\r\nthan the academic student.\"\r\n\r\nAs the day of the poll (March 11th) drew near, confident hopes of\r\nvictory began to be entertained by many outside the Labour Party. The\r\nmost telling election cry used by his supporters was innocently supplied\r\nby the opposition candidate, Mr. Drage, a gentleman who at one time sat\r\nwith Crooks on the Asylums Board. At one of his public meetings early in\r\nthe campaign, Mr. Drage attempted to justify certain low wages paid in\r\nthe Woolwich Arsenal by remarking that half a loaf was better than no\r\nbread.\r\n\r\nThe Labour Party seized upon the words at once. \"No half-loaf policy for\r\nus; we want the whole loaf,\" was their immediate retort.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment the loaf became the feature of the fight. As Free Trade\r\nand Protection were also to the front, the loaf had a double\r\nsignificance. Crooks's supporters carried about the streets, on the end\r\nof poles, loaves and half-loaves to represent the rival policies. \"F. C.\r\nG.,\" in one of his _Westminster Gazette_ cartoons, represented Crooks\r\nstanding firm and solid on the whole loaf, while his opponent balanced\r\nhimself with some temerity on a tottering half-loaf.\r\n\r\nPolling day dawned hopefully. Sunshine illumined the streets, while the\r\nLabour candidate's carriages filled them. For once a Labour man\r\nout-classed a Conservative in the number and style of his conveyances.\r\nFriends of Crooks sent four-in-hands, motor cars, two-horse carriages,\r\ntraps, drags, vans, coal-carts, and donkey shays. The bakers of the\r\ndistrict had made thousands of miniature loaves about the size of\r\nwalnuts, which were in evidence everywhere. With stalks through them,\r\nthese loaves were sold in the streets and shops for a penny. Men wore\r\nthem in their buttonholes, boys in their caps, and women on their\r\ndresses as a symbol of the Labour man's policy of the whole loaf.\r\n\r\nVictory had been hoped for, but victory such as that achieved was beyond\r\nthe wildest dreams. A Conservative majority of 2805 was turned by Crooks\r\ninto a Labour majority of 3229--\"the greatest by-election victory of\r\nmodern times,\" as the _Speaker_ described it. The actual poll was:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Crooks (Labour)        8687\r\n     Drage  (Conservative)  5458\r\n                            ----\r\n            Majority        3229\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILL CROOKS ADDRESSING AN OPEN-AIR MEETING IN BERESFORD\r\nSQUARE DURING THE WOOLWICH BYE-ELECTION IN 1903.]\r\n\r\nTo the little company of supporters of both parties assembled in the\r\ncounting room of the Town Hall, Crooks turned after the declaration of\r\nthe result, and proposed the usual vote of thanks to the returning\r\nofficer. He added:--\r\n\r\n\"May I say, now that I am elected Member for Woolwich, that it will be\r\nmy aim and desire to serve all sections of the people of Woolwich,\r\nincluding, of course, those who voted for Mr. Drage, as well as those\r\nwho voted for me. So far as Mr. Drage and myself are concerned, we shall\r\nstill retain the same friendship we have had for years.\"\r\n\r\nIn seconding the vote, Mr. Drage congratulated Mr. Crooks on the great\r\nvictory he had won, and assured him that their friendship had not been\r\nshaken by the campaign.\r\n\r\nA roar from the streets told that the news had reached the waiting\r\ncrowds. The new Member with his wife and a few friends passed out of the\r\nTown Hall into the midst of the multitude. It was only by the aid of the\r\npolice, who opened a passage through the serried ranks, that Crooks was\r\nable to reach the market square by the Arsenal gates, where it had been\r\narranged he should speak.\r\n\r\nIt was then nigh on midnight, but when he mounted a cart he looked out\r\non a sea of faces in the glare of improvised torches and the street\r\nlamps such as had never been witnessed at that hour in Woolwich before.\r\n\r\nAmid the exuberant joy of this multitude, it was in vain he tried to\r\nspeak. One sentence only, sharp and clear, broke in between the\r\ncheering:--\r\n\r\n\"To-night Woolwich has sent a message of love and hope to Labour all\r\nover the country.\"\r\n\r\nNot another word could be heard. Finally he gave up the attempt to\r\nspeak. The crowd was content to roll out its cheers. These increased in\r\nvolume when someone from the dark mass passed up a large bouquet of\r\nflowers to Mrs. Crooks.\r\n\r\nSo the curtain fell on a great fight. Mrs. Crooks, with her presentation\r\nbouquet, the happiest woman in England. The crowd of workers, who felt\r\nthat a workers' battle had been won and a new hope arisen. And the new\r\nMember of Parliament, very tired, cheery, undisturbed, desirous only\r\nthat the efforts of those who had assisted should be gratefully\r\nacknowledged and no undue credit given to the vigorous and magnetic\r\npersonality who had focussed all the enthusiasm and driven it forward\r\ninto an unprecedented victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nADVENT OF THE POLITICAL LABOUR PARTY\r\n\r\n     Congratulations--A Letter from Bishop Talbot--Bar-parlour\r\n     Opinion--The Press on the Victory--The Birth of a Party--An\r\n     Opponent of the South African War.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore Crooks went down to the House of Commons on the following day, he\r\nhad a busy morning opening telegrams to the number of two or three\r\nhundred.\r\n\r\nMr. John Burns, Mr. Keir Hardie, Mr. David Shackleton, wired their\r\ncongratulations from the House of Commons. Other messages came from\r\ntrade unions and groups of working-men and working-women in various\r\nparts of the country. Among them were telegrams from dockers at\r\nMiddlesbrough, coopers at Birmingham, postmen in London, engineers at\r\nNewcastle, and cycle-makers at Coventry.\r\n\r\nThese well-wishes from the ranks of Labour poured in simultaneously with\r\ncongratulations from Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, the Hon. Maud\r\nStanley, Lord Tweedmouth, Mr. Beerbohm Tree, and many ministers of\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nThe late Sir Wilfrid Lawson, as was his wont dropped into verse. He\r\nwired from Carlisle:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Hurrah! The future brighter looks;\r\n     We worry on by hooks and Crooks.\r\n     Oh, what a heavy, heavy blow\r\n     Last night you struck on Jingo Joe!\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Bishop's House, Kennington, S.E., Dr. Talbot wrote:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     I wish, as one to whom, as its Bishop, the affairs of Woolwich are\r\n     of great interest, to offer you my sincere good wishes for your\r\n     Parliamentary course.\r\n\r\n     I am aware that by so writing at this moment I may risk\r\n     misunderstanding and seem to \"worship the rising sun,\" and that you\r\n     may not care for words when there were not deeds in support.\r\n\r\n     But I venture to risk this: and to trust you to take as genuine\r\n     what is genuinely said. I think you are the man to do this.\r\n\r\n     I cannot but feel and I desire to express great satisfaction that\r\n     the needs and interests of Labour should have their representative\r\n     in one who has given such proof of desire to work and suffer for\r\n     the welfare of his fellow-men as you have done.\r\n\r\n     All that I have heard of you commands my admiration and respect. It\r\n     will be a great pleasure to find there are occasions when we may\r\n     co-operate for the public welfare in Woolwich.\r\n\r\n     Had the Bishop of Bloemfontein--Chandler--been in England, I might\r\n     have asked him for an introduction to you; as it is, may our common\r\n     friendship for him serve the purpose.\r\n\r\n     You will come into Parliament with great power from your character\r\n     and experience, and as the representative by such a majority of\r\n     such a place. May you seek, and may God Almighty give you, the\r\n     wisdom and strength to use rightly this great position.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo turn from the Bishop to the bar-parlour will help us to preserve the\r\nbalance of things human. While Dr. Talbot was sending his blessing from\r\nthe Bishop's House, there came a chorus of good-wishes from nearly every\r\npublic-house in Woolwich. This was all the more remarkable because\r\nCrooks had made the constituency hold its sides with laughter over the\r\ninnumerable stories he told during the campaign against beer-drinkers.\r\nThose who laughed the loudest were the drinkers themselves, admitting\r\nwhile so doing they had never heard a teetotaler put the case against\r\nthem so well before.\r\n\r\nIt was a great delight to Crooks to learn that even the regular tipplers\r\nwere saying among themselves that \"although that chap Crooks don't spare\r\nus blokes, he's the man for our money.\"\r\n\r\nOne conversation reported to him from a public-house a few days after\r\nthe election was certainly quaint and amusing. The narrator was the best\r\nof mimics. He told how the subject of the election was introduced by \"a\r\nlong thin man with a sheeny nose,\" who had just come in.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" began the new-comer, without any preliminary, \"I've read 'The\r\nFifteen Decisive Battles of the World,' but I tell you Woolwich licks\r\nthe lot.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about Napoleon Bonaparty?\" ventured one of the company.\r\n\r\n\"Bonaparty? What did Bony do? Why, ten years after Wellington won\r\nWaterloo things was back worse than they was before.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought Bill Adams won the battle of Waterloo,\" called out a voice\r\nfrom the corner bench.\r\n\r\n\"You shouldn't think; it might hurt yer head.\"\r\n\r\n\"D'yer reckon as Crooks is bigger nor Bony was?\" inquired the first\r\nquestioner.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly I do,\" said the long thin one, severely. \"What did Bony do?\r\nWhy, he made men fight for him. But what did Crooks do? Why, he taught\r\nmen to fight for themselves and their families. See? Bony built his\r\nhouse on the sands, and the tide of humanity has washed it away. Now\r\nCrooks taught us men to build our own house, and nothing can destroy it\r\nwhile we stick together.\"\r\n\r\nTo the new Member there came in due time congratulatory messages from\r\nEurope, America, South Africa, and Australia. Children also sent him\r\ntheir well-wishes--children are always writing to Crooks--one letter\r\nbeing signed by a whole family of them in Plumstead with their ages set\r\nout like stepping-stones after each signature. This \"little household,\"\r\nas they called themselves, told him how eagerly they had \"watched the\r\npapers,\" and how glad they were he had won.\r\n\r\nOne only of the many letters that poured in sounded a despondent note.\r\nIt was signed by two desolate old women who lived together in Poplar.\r\n\r\n\"We have just heard,\" they wrote, \"you have been elected Member for\r\nWoolwich. Does this mean you are going to leave Poplar? If so, please\r\ngive up Parliament, for who have we to look to for help if you go away?\"\r\n\r\nSome of his supporters were anxious to serve him in a practical way.\r\nThe workers at a tailoring establishment in Woolwich asked him to allow\r\nthem to make him a suit of clothes \"as a thank-offering for the splendid\r\nvictory.\" When a fortnight later they sent the suit it was with an\r\nexpression of \"regret that it is not like our esteem--warranted not to\r\nwear out.\"\r\n\r\nThe Press all over the country was profoundly impressed by the result.\r\nThe Liberal papers for the most part were too eager to hail it as a blow\r\nat the Conservative Government to see its true significance. The\r\nConservative papers, in attempting to lessen its effect on their own\r\nparty, got nearer to the real meaning that lay behind the victory.\r\n\r\nAs the _Times_ put it:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     The result ... means that the questions bound up with the existence\r\n     of an organised Labour Party which have been hitherto regarded as\r\n     chimerical are coming to the front in practical politics.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Pall Mall Gazette_ also got near the mark:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Mr. Crooks's return is first and most obviously an indication of\r\n     the growing strength of the idea of an organised Labour Party, such\r\n     as under the name of Socialism is so potent a force in Continental\r\n     politics.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Woolwich was the first manifestation to the public of the birth of\r\nthe political Labour Party.\r\n\r\nThe election came within a few weeks of the famous Newcastle conference\r\nof the Labour Representation Committee, whose delegates represented over\r\na million organised workmen in the country. That was the conference\r\nwhich decided on the absolute independence of the Labour Party. Almost\r\nthe first duty of its secretary, Mr. J. R. Macdonald, on his return from\r\nNewcastle was to issue an appeal \"to everyone in London interested in\r\nthe formation of a Labour Party in the House of Commons to go to\r\nWoolwich to help Mr. Crooks.\"\r\n\r\nThe best explanation of the striking Labour triumph was given by Crooks\r\nhimself in the _Daily News_:--\r\n\r\n\"The workman is learning after years of unfulfilled pledges and broken\r\npromises of the usual party stamp that before he can get anything like\r\njustice he must transfer his faith from 'gentlemen' candidates to Labour\r\ncandidates. The workman has seen how the 'gentlemen' of England have\r\ntreated him in the last few years--taxed his bread, his sugar, his tea;\r\ntampered with his children's education, attacked his trade unions, made\r\nlight of the unemployed problem, and shirked old-age pensions.\r\n\r\n\"What the workman has done in Woolwich, you will find he will do in\r\nother towns.\"\r\n\r\nHis prophecy was fulfilled within three years. The General Election of\r\n1906 saw Labour men for the first time returned for two or three dozen\r\nconstituencies, some with the greatest majorities known to political\r\nhistory. As the amazing results poured in from day to day, with their\r\nthree and five and even six thousand majorities, a prominent public man\r\ndeclared at the time:--\"This is the Party that was born at Woolwich.\"\r\n\r\nOne significant phase of the Woolwich by-election was emphasised by the\r\n_Speaker_. Here, in a district where the majority of workers earn their\r\ndaily bread in the Government Arsenal, a man was elected who had\r\nbitterly opposed the South African war, which from the material\r\nstandpoint had brought a period of prosperity to Woolwich without\r\nparallel. The _Speaker_ went on to say:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Mr. Crooks was among the sturdiest and most outspoken opponents of\r\n     the war and its objects, and a man who survived that ordeal may be\r\n     trusted to stand to his colours in the next emergency. He was a\r\n     conspicuous member of what was called the \"Pro-Boer\" party. He was\r\n     one of the orators at the famous Trafalgar Square meeting that the\r\n     jingoes broke up.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the pages of the same weekly journal the new member for Woolwich\r\nwrote an article on the Labour Party. \"The Labour Party,\" he said, \"is\r\nquite a natural result of the failure of rich people legislating for the\r\npoor. The one hope of the workman is a strong Labour Party.... The\r\nLabour Member has nothing but his service to give in return for support.\r\nPerhaps he is dependent on his fellows for his maintenance until Payment\r\nof Members is secured. The continued selection of rich men for\r\nworking-class constituencies is a perversion of representation, and\r\nquite as absurd as it would be to attempt to run a Labour candidate for\r\nthe aristocratic West-End division of St. George's, Hanover Square.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nTHE LIVING WAGE FOR MEN AND WOMEN\r\n\r\n     Crooks's Maiden Speech--A Welcome from the Treasury Bench--Demand\r\n     for a Fair Wage in Government Workshops--Advocating the Payment of\r\n     Members and the Enfranchisement of Women--Crooks's Hold upon the\r\n     House.\r\n\r\n\r\nA fortnight after his election to Parliament, Crooks made his maiden\r\nspeech. He called attention to the fact that the Government was allowing\r\nportions of the national workshops at Woolwich Arsenal to remain idle\r\nwhile it was giving work that could be done in them to outside\r\ncontractors.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know how it appears to other hon. members,\" he told the House,\r\n\"but it seems to me that every department of a Government which claims\r\nto be a business Government ought to have the right to make the first\r\nuse of all the resources which the nation has placed at its disposal\r\nbefore considering outside contractors.... The contractors have fairly\r\ngood representation in this House, and many things are to be said in\r\ntheir favour; but the Government has no right to use the money of the\r\nnation in building machinery and then to allow it to stand idle in the\r\ninterests of outside firms, no matter who they are or what influence\r\nthey may have.\"\r\n\r\nIn the opening words of his reply, the Minister for War (Mr. Brodrick)\r\nsaid he was sure that whatever their opinion as to the views of the hon.\r\nmember (Mr. Crooks), all sections of the House would welcome his\r\nappearance in debate on a subject on which he was so fully informed.\r\n\r\nThe same day Crooks called the attention of the House to the low wages\r\npaid to labourers in the national workshops.\r\n\r\n\"I maintain that it is not cheap for the Government to pay men 21s. per\r\nweek, although other employers may be able to get them for that amount.\r\nIf the men had more money they would be able to get better house\r\naccommodation, and the ratepayers would be saved the substantial sums\r\nnow paid under the Poor Law for medical orders for people brought up in\r\nover-crowded homes. The President of the Local Government Board knows\r\nthat in consequence of over-crowding in London, hundreds of such medical\r\norders go to people living under unhealthy conditions, impossible to\r\navoid when the family depends on this weekly wage of 21s. paid to\r\nGovernment employees. Such earnings are barely sufficient for food, let\r\nalone shelter. An order has been issued by the Local Government Board\r\ninstructing Guardians to feed the inmates of workhouses properly. The\r\nminimum scale laid down for persons in workhouses is of a character that\r\nno man with a family can approach if he is only earning 21s. a week.\r\nWhat I urge is that the men in the employment of the State should have\r\na Local Government Board existence, if nothing else--that the men in the\r\nnational workshops should no longer have to live on a lower food scale\r\nthan that prescribed for workhouses.\"\r\n\r\nBefore he had been in Parliament a month, he got an opportunity to\r\nintroduce a proposal in favour of the payment of members. The House was\r\nwell filled when he rose to move the following motion:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     That, in the opinion of this House, it is desirable and expedient\r\n     that, in order to give constituencies a full and free choice in the\r\n     selection of Parliamentary candidates, the charges now made by the\r\n     returning officer to the candidates should be chargeable to public\r\n     funds, and that all members of the House of Commons should receive\r\n     from the State a reasonable stipend during their Parliamentary\r\n     life.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe addressed the House at some length on this motion. Here is a summary\r\nof his speech:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     There was a good deal of talk about there being absolute equality\r\n     in this country, but there was, as every member knew, only one way\r\n     of getting into the House, and that was by spending substantial\r\n     sums of money. A considerable sum of money was spent in securing\r\n     his election, but he did not have to find a farthing of it. The\r\n     cash was subscribed openly and freely. But he had often heard it\r\n     asked when a poor man was standing: \"Who is finding your money?\"\r\n\r\n     Only the other day he saw the following advertisement in the\r\n     _Yorkshire Post_:--\r\n\r\n          M.P.--A gentleman, thirty, holding a responsible\r\n          position in London, desirous of entering Parliament,\r\n          wishes to meet with an affectionate and wealthy lady,\r\n          view matrimony. Genuine. Highest credentials.\r\n\r\n     It might be suggested that men would go into the House of Commons\r\n     simply to make a living out of it. But was there not in the present\r\n     House more than one member who made a pretty good thing out of the\r\n     privilege of being able to attach the magic letters \"M.P.\" to their\r\n     names? However that might be, he ventured to assert that the\r\n     administrative capacity of this country had never yet been properly\r\n     tapped.\r\n\r\n     It was said a man needed to be trained for political life. Yes, but\r\n     where? Was it at the University? Was it by taking a double first at\r\n     Oxford or Cambridge that he would turn out a great law-maker, or\r\n     was it by constant contact with humanity? He had seen in the Press\r\n     an observation to the effect that it was all very well for Labour\r\n     to have its representatives in Parliament, but what did they know\r\n     of those great historic and important questions which so vitally\r\n     affected the interests and welfare of the nation? His answer to\r\n     that was that it was infinitely more important to the average\r\n     industrial worker of this country that the conditions of life\r\n     should be bettered, and that an opportunity should be given for men\r\n     to enter the House who knew what he wanted.\r\n\r\n     He was one of those who believed that practical knowledge of\r\n     working men would prove exceedingly helpful in the deliberations of\r\n     the House. There were too many academically-trained men and too few\r\n     practical men engaged in the government of the country. He had been\r\n     in touch with working-men for years and years; he had sat with them\r\n     on administrative bodies, and his experience was that one touch of\r\n     nature was worth infinitely more than all the academic training\r\n     Oxford or Cambridge could give.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe speech was listened to with sympathetic interest, frequently\r\nproducing laughter and cheers. The motion, however, was talked out by\r\nthe Government's supporters.\r\n\r\nIn his election address Crooks had shown that he wanted women to have\r\nthe vote. It was with much satisfaction, therefore, that he introduced\r\nthe Women's Enfranchisement Bill prepared by the Independent Labour\r\nParty. The second reading not having been reached when the Session\r\nclosed, the Bill fell through. Similar measures which have his support\r\nhave been introduced since. He hopes they will be brought forward\r\nregularly until a woman's right to the franchise is recognised.\r\n\r\nHe gave in the _Review of Reviews_ his reasons for introducing the Bill\r\nthat bore his name:--\r\n\r\n\"It is because in all my public work I aim at making the people\r\nself-reliant, able to think and act for themselves, that I want women to\r\nhave the power and the responsibility that the possession of the vote\r\ngives. It is by this rather than by any consideration of how their votes\r\nwould be used that I ask for woman's suffrage. At the same time I\r\nbelieve that the cause of progress has nothing to fear from this reform.\r\nWe entrust to women as teachers and as mothers the all-important work of\r\neducating the future citizens. How absurd, then, to hesitate to give to\r\nwomen the rights of a citizen. As regards the women of the\r\nworking-class, I point out constantly that all the many social questions\r\nthat are pressing for settlement affect these women as much as, if not\r\nmore than, they affect their husbands. We must give women a share in\r\nsettling such questions.\"\r\n\r\nHe went on, in the course of further remarks in the same magazine, to\r\nlay great stress on the importance of organisation and of agitation in\r\norder to secure the vote for women. There should be local workers in\r\nevery constituency. Every member of the House of Commons should have\r\nstrong pressure brought to bear upon him. No woman, he urged, should\r\nwork for any candidate who is not a supporter of women's franchise. If\r\nthe candidate put forward by her own political party cannot support\r\nthis, she should work for the candidate who can, no matter to what party\r\nhe belonged.\r\n\r\n\"If women are in earnest on this question,\" he added, \"they must prove\r\nit by putting principle before party, and making the enfranchisement of\r\ntheir sex the first object of all their political work.\"\r\n\r\nOn political platforms he often mentioned an incident that arose in\r\nconnection with a protest he made against the low wages paid to women in\r\nthe Government's Victualling Yard at Deptford.\r\n\r\n\"It's starvation,\" he told one of the responsible officials, \"to pay\r\nwidows with families 14s. a week.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it's constant,\" said the amazed official.\r\n\r\n\"So, you see,\" Crooks adds in telling the incident, \"that Government\r\nofficials think starvation's all right so long as it's constant. Do you\r\nthink this system of constant starvation would be tolerated for a day if\r\nwomen had the vote?\"\r\n\r\nBefore Mr. Balfour's Government came to an end, Crooks had become one of\r\nthe popular speakers of the House. He brought into Parliament a lively\r\nconversational style rarely found in that assembly. His quaint\r\nwitticisms, his telling illustrations from the every-day life of the\r\npeople, together with his downright sincerity, his tolerance and\r\nrestraint, won him the good-will of both sides of the House. Whether\r\npleading for underfed school children, for the unemployed, or speaking\r\nagainst the taxation of the people's food, he was generally admitted to\r\nbe bright and forceful. He never spoke without bringing a new point of\r\nview to the debate. \"Jehu Junior,\" writing in _Vanity Fair_, said of\r\nhim:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     His tact and common-sense served him as well in the House as they\r\n     had done in settling Labour disputes at Poplar. By never debating\r\n     any subject but those on which he has special knowledge, and by his\r\n     perfect good temper and modesty, he became one of the men whose\r\n     politics arouse no personal animosity on the \"other side.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOf him and the other Labour men in that Parliament--the small band of\r\nstalwarts who were reinforced so strongly at the General Election of\r\n1906--Mr. John Morley, addressing his own constituents at Montrose,\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Will anybody, who has watched the life of the House of Commons, say\r\n     that in moderation of demeanour, in decency of manners, in\r\n     self-respect, in freedom from swagger and assumption, these men\r\n     have shown themselves inferior to men sitting by their side who\r\n     have had all the opportunities of wealth, education, and culture?\r\n     If I were leaving the House of Commons to-morrow, and were called\r\n     upon to adjudicate a prize, I would impartially give the prize for\r\n     good manners, for self-respect, for moderation of statement, for\r\n     respect for the audience they addressed in the House of Commons, to\r\n     the dozen Labour men whom we have had the pleasure of having among\r\n     us rather than to a dozen gentlemen I could name if I liked.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the other side of the House came the testimony of Sir John Gorst.\r\nThe ex-Conservative Minister brought out his book, \"The Children of the\r\nNation\"--wherein he argues that it is the duty of the State to see that\r\nthe nation's children are well fed, well housed, and well clothed--with\r\nthe following dedication:--\"To the Labour Members of the House of\r\nCommons in token of my belief that they are animated by a genuine desire\r\nto ameliorate the condition of the people.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nFREE TRADE IN THE NAME OF THE POOR\r\n\r\n     M.P.'s Investments and their Votes--A Lecture from a Lady of\r\n     Title--Urged to give up some of his Public Work--Defending Free\r\n     Trade throughout the Country--Ridiculing Tariff Reform at\r\n     Birmingham--A Brush with Mr. Chamberlain--Real \"Little Englanders.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Show me where a man has his money invested and I will tell you how he\r\nwill vote.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was Crooks's way of summing up the House of Commons before he had\r\nbeen a Member many months. Someone had expressed surprise to him that\r\nboth Liberal and Conservative Members should have combined to support\r\nthe proposed Electric Trust for London when the L.C.C. was promoting a\r\nmunicipal scheme.\r\n\r\n\"The first lesson one learns in Parliament,\" he replied, \"is that the\r\ntwo great parties generally forget their political differences when the\r\njust claims of the people threaten their pockets.\"\r\n\r\nIt amused him to find that many Members preferred the smoking room and\r\nthe Terrace to the House. It was on the Terrace he overheard a\r\nConservative Member ask a Liberal:--\r\n\r\n\"Are you in favour of this Bill?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I am,\" came the halting reply.\r\n\r\n\"That's all right, then; I'm against it. We needn't go up to\r\nvote--we'll pair.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Crooks left those British legislators smoking on the Terrace, since\r\nit was too much trouble to them to go inside and vote.\r\n\r\nIt was on the Terrace one afternoon that a party of titled ladies,\r\ntaking tea, sought his acquaintance. They immediately began to lecture\r\nhim on his duty to the poor.\r\n\r\n\"I think you are supremely stupid to bother about the poor as you do,\r\nMr. Crooks,\" said one of the dames from behind her fan. \"I am told they\r\nare always coming to your house to consult you about their troubles. If\r\nthey came to my house I should order them away.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure you would, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if those dreadful people were only like me they wouldn't listen to\r\nwhat you tell them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure they wouldn't, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\"You needn't be sarcastic, Mr. Crooks. I would send them to the Poor Law\r\nofficers or the Charity Organisation people.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then, as another honourable member joined the party, the good lady\r\nturned to him:\r\n\r\n\"I'm just teaching Mr. Crooks his place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed,\" said the Labour man, \"I thought I was teaching you yours.\"\r\n\r\nIt was more agreeable to him when accosted by one of the policemen on\r\nduty in the House.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Crooks, how's Poplar?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know Poplar?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I used to be stationed that way. I well remember your Dock Gate\r\nmeetings. I liked the Poplar people better than the West Enders. You\r\ntake it from me, Mr. Crooks, there's far more respect for law and order\r\nin Poplar than there is in the West End.\"\r\n\r\nHe still kept his College by the Dock Gates going, notwithstanding his\r\nelection to Parliament. Indeed, he was still as much the servant of\r\nPoplar as of Woolwich.\r\n\r\nParliament, of course, added enormously to his work. Friends urged him\r\nto give up several of his public posts. He was advised to retire from\r\nthe Asylums Board, and doubtless would have done so but for a powerful\r\nappeal sent to him not to desert the Board's children. He wanted to\r\nresign from the Poplar Board of Guardians, of which he had then been\r\nChairman for half a dozen successive years; but all parties in the\r\nborough pleaded with him to remain, and the Conservatives and Liberals\r\nwithdrew their candidates in his ward in order that he might be returned\r\nunopposed. He was showered with requests to remain for the sake of the\r\npoor. At last he agreed, on the understanding that he should give less\r\ntime to the work. This was perhaps an unwise decision, for owing to the\r\nslackening of his personal vigilance the administration was besmirched\r\nby irregularities which of course laid the Chairman's Poor Law policy\r\nopen to the attacks of his opponents.\r\n\r\nThe only post he gave up was that on the Poplar Borough Council. The\r\nLabour League would not hear of his resigning from the London County\r\nCouncil, and within a year of his election to Parliament, Poplar\r\nre-elected him to the L.C.C. with a majority of over 1,600.\r\n\r\nThe demands made upon him to address public meetings in other parts of\r\nthe country became terrific after Woolwich. I found him one afternoon\r\nturning over the pages of his engagement book with a worried look.\r\n\r\n\"I'm just wondering whether I can do it,\" he said. \"I find I'm booked to\r\nspeak at thirteen different meetings at different places within the next\r\nfortnight, and I've just got a pressing appeal to speak at another\r\nwithin the same time.\"\r\n\r\nThe appeals came from the churches, from temperance societies, from\r\nAdult Sunday Schools, from P.S.A.'s, as well as from Labour\r\norganisations.\r\n\r\nThe Labour Party, which was then organising for its great political\r\ntriumph of 1906, had his first consideration always. He addressed Labour\r\nmeetings all over the country, nearly always with an audience of three\r\nor four thousand. He was at Glasgow, Birmingham, Leicester, Plymouth,\r\nLiverpool, Exeter, Darlington, Ipswich, Chatham, Newcastle, Blackburn,\r\nBarnard Castle, Huddersfield, Edinburgh, Cardiff, all within a few\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nEverywhere he turned Mr. Chamberlain's tariff proposals into ridicule.\r\nHe made his great Birmingham audience laugh the loudest. He told that\r\nand other audiences:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Mr. Chamberlain has shown you two loaves, the Free Trade loaf and\r\n     the Protection loaf.\r\n\r\n     \"There's hardly any difference between them,\" he tells you. \"Why\r\n     make all this fuss?\"\r\n\r\n     Let him take the two loaves down a Birmingham court and ask a poor\r\n     woman with children to cut them up. She'll soon tell him the\r\n     difference between the solid Free Trade loaf and the spongy\r\n     Protectionist loaf. You trust the mother of a family to know the\r\n     difference between good bread and blown-out pastry.\r\n\r\n     \"Ah, but we must make sacrifices in the interest of the Empire,\"\r\n     says Mr. Chamberlain.\r\n\r\n     Let him come down our way and talk like that in Poplar. I tried it\r\n     the other day.\r\n\r\n     \"Times is awful bad just now, Mr. Crooks,\" said one of a party of\r\n     women who stopped me on my way to the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n     \"Yes,\" I said, \"but don't you know the new kind of comfort the\r\n     Imperialists have found for you? They say you belong to an Empire\r\n     on which the sun never sets. It's so filling, isn't it, when you're\r\n     hungry?\"\r\n\r\n     \"An Empire on which the sun never sets!\" cried one of the women,\r\n     pointing towards her slum tenement. \"What's the good of talking to\r\n     us like that? Why, the sun never rises on our court!\"\r\n\r\n     \"That may be,\" I say, \"but you've got to pay more for your bread\r\n     and your meat, all in the interests of the Empire. You've got to\r\n     learn to make sacrifices for the Empire.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Look here, Will,\" says the eldest among them; \"I've known you\r\n     since you was in petticoats, and you've never deceived me yet.\r\n     Wot's the use of talking to us about sacrifices when we can't make\r\n     both ends meet as it is?\"\r\n\r\n     \"Both ends meet!\" exclaimed one of the women. \"We think we are\r\n     lucky if we can get one end meat and the other end bread.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Wot's it all about, Mr. Crooks?\" asked another. \"Here's bread\r\n     gone up a ha'penny a loaf. And sugar and tea's gone up. And the\r\n     children say they don't get so many sweets for a farthing now as\r\n     they used to.\"\r\n\r\n     \"And,\" I added, \"meat's likely to go up too--all in the interests\r\n     of the Empire. Twopence a pound more for Colonial mutton.\"\r\n\r\n     \"What!\" they cried in a body. \"Twopence more for mutton!\"\r\n\r\n     \"Haven't you heard?\" I went on. \"The Tariff Reformers have a great\r\n     scheme to bind the Empire together by letting the Colonies charge\r\n     us more for our food. If you don't agree with them they'll call you\r\n     little Englanders.\"\r\n\r\n     \"That's just it,\" said one of the women. \"If I'm to pay another\r\n     twopence a pound for meat my children will soon be Little\r\n     Englanders!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThen turning suddenly from his anecdotal style, Crooks would go on to\r\nask his audience how a worthy Imperial race was to be built up on a lack\r\nof food?\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Empire begins in the workman's kitchen. The imposition of new\r\n     duties on food imports, though no more than a penny or twopence,\r\n     means to many a poor housewife the difference between having and\r\n     going without.\r\n\r\n     I know one large family where the recent addition of a half-penny\r\n     on the loaf robbed the children of a slice of bread a day. Do you\r\n     know what that means? Have you ever lived in a family where the\r\n     slices have to be counted, and where every child could eat twice as\r\n     much as its allowance? I belonged to such a family as a child, and\r\n     when a clergyman came round once and found my mother crying over an\r\n     empty cupboard, he said:\r\n\r\n     \"Ah, well; God sends the bread for all the mouths.\"\r\n\r\n     \"That's all very fine,\" my mother said; \"but He seems to send the\r\n     mouths to our house and the bread to yours.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe policy of Preference came in for his banter equally with that of\r\nProtection. Under any scheme of Preference, the relation of this\r\ncountry, with its large imports, to our Colonies, which take\r\ncomparatively few of our exports, he used to say reminded him of a\r\nboxing-match between a thin man and a fat man. After the first round or\r\ntwo the fat man stops and says:\r\n\r\n\"This ain't fair; you've got more to strike at than I have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then,\" says the thin man, \"let's chalk my size out on your\r\nbody, and all blows outside the chalk mark don't count.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain seems to have heard how Crooks was riddling with\r\nridicule his Protection and Preference policies up and down the country.\r\nAt any rate, the ex-Minister began his favourite policy of Retaliation.\r\nAt some of his public meetings he supported his argument by representing\r\nCrooks as having said at Leith that the poor of this country were worse\r\noff than the poor of any other country.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Crooks heard of this he wrote to Mr. Chamberlain:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     SIR,--I do not for a moment think you deliberately misquoted the\r\n     words I used at Leith, but whoever sent you the information is\r\n     absolutely without excuse for the blunder. For what I said I have\r\n     said in twenty different parts of the kingdom to tens of thousands\r\n     of our fellow-countrymen--viz. \"that even if, as Mr. Chamberlain\r\n     suggests, the Colonies do desire Preference, it is no reason why\r\n     the poor of Great Britain should pay more for their bread to help\r\n     those Colonies which have no poor, or certainly no poverty\r\n     compared with the poverty we have in this country.\"\r\n\r\n     This, as you will note, makes a very great difference in the\r\n     reading of your quotation of what I really did say.\r\n\r\n     I am, yours truly,\r\n\r\n     WILL CROOKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn reply Mr. Chamberlain sent a tardy apology, thus:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     SIR,--I have your letter of December 17th, and in reply I beg to\r\n     say that the statement which you say you have repeatedly used is in\r\n     no sense inconsistent with the statement which you were reported to\r\n     have made at Leith, and which referred not to the Colonies but to\r\n     foreign countries. Unfortunately, I have only the extract which was\r\n     sent to me and not the whole speech, and of course if you deny\r\n     having used the words which I quoted I most readily accept your\r\n     contradiction.\r\n\r\n     I am, yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n     JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nA fallacy very popular with Protectionists was neatly dealt with by\r\nCrooks at a meeting of the London County Council. One of the Moderate\r\nmembers asked whether an assurance could be given that certain tramway\r\nmaterials would be of British manufacture.\r\n\r\nThe reply was that since the Council worked under Free Trade conditions,\r\nno such assurance could be given.\r\n\r\n\"Will not trade union conditions be observed?\" inquired another Moderate\r\nmember.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you call that acting on a Free Trade basis?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some members,\" interposed Crooks, \"seem to identify trade union\r\nconditions with Protection.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite right too,\" shouted the Moderate.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" came Crooks's retort; \"but the one kind of Protection is the\r\nprotection of the workers against the sweater, and the other kind is the\r\nprotection of the sweater against the workers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nPREPARING FOR THE UNEMPLOYED ACT\r\n\r\n     Principles for dealing with Unemployed--Twenty-four Per Cent. of\r\n     Poplar's Wage-earners out of Work--Folly of Stone-breaking and\r\n     Oakum-picking--Public Warning by Crooks and Canon Barnett--How\r\n     Crooks used a Gift of £1,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrooks's three years in Mr. Balfour's Parliament had a remarkable\r\ntriumph in the Unemployed Act. No one needs reminding that the measure\r\nwas introduced by the Government; but as the sequel will show, it is\r\ndoubtful whether it would have seen the light, and it is certain it\r\nwould never have been passed but for his untiring advocacy.\r\n\r\nThis was so far recognised at the time that one of the bitterest\r\nopponents of the measure, Sir William Chance, a stern disciple of the\r\nCharity Organisation Society, described it as \"a Poplar Bill framed to\r\nmeet Poplar's needs.\"\r\n\r\nSo it was. For Poplar's needs just then were the needs of the\r\nunemployed. And the unemployed's needs were the same all the country\r\nover. The Bill was introduced about the time the Poplar Guardians took a\r\ncensus of the unemployed in typical working-class streets in the\r\ndistrict, revealing over twenty-four per cent. of the wage-earners out\r\nof work.\r\n\r\nThe Bill was based on the principle which had guided Crooks in all his\r\ndealings with the unemployed. The only sound way to help an unemployed\r\nman, he maintains, is by work rather than by relief. The condition he\r\nimposes on the provision of such work is that it must be useful. He will\r\nhave nothing to do with \"works\" provided only as \"relief.\" Work that is\r\nnot useful can never relieve.\r\n\r\nHis agitation in Parliament put the crown on fifteen years of laborious\r\nstriving to make the State admit a duty to its unemployed citizens.\r\n\r\nAs far back as September, 1893, he was appealing in the _Daily\r\nChronicle_ to the Board of Trade and the Thames Conservancy to help in\r\nallaying the threatened distress of the coming winter by reclaiming\r\nforeshores. His appeal was taken up at the time by other papers, which\r\ncomplimented him upon the practical common-sense character of his\r\nproposals.\r\n\r\nSomewhere in the archives of the Board of Trade that scheme of his\r\ndoubtless lies buried to this day. He is still confident it will be\r\ncarried out some time. He is fond of saying that it takes Parliament\r\nseven years to grasp a new idea and seven more to carry it out.\r\n\r\nCompressed into a few lines in his own words, the story of his effort\r\nruns in this way:--\"It was in the November of 1893 that in consequence\r\nof what I had been saying at public meetings and in the Press, I was\r\nurged to lay the scheme before Mr. Mundella, who was President of the\r\nBoard of Trade at the time. There was great suffering that winter, and\r\nthe Local Government Board advised all the local authorities to put in\r\nhand as much public work as possible. Well and good, I said, but let the\r\nGovernment do the same. I pointed out that under the Foreshores Act of\r\n1866 the Board of Trade had power to reclaim land. Again, under an Act\r\nof 1857 the Thames Conservancy could reclaim miles of foreshore in and\r\nbelow London. I showed that this was just the kind of work to absorb\r\nunskilled labour, and supplied examples of the success of reclaiming\r\nland on the banks of the Forth and the Tay and on the Lincolnshire\r\ncoast.\"\r\n\r\nAs his Poor Law duties crowded heavily upon him he had opportunities as\r\na Guardian of carrying out in his own district his guiding principle in\r\nregard to the provision of useful work. He found the usual \"task\" work\r\ngoing on in the workhouse. He saw its degrading uselessness and\r\nabolished it. In place of oakum-picking and stone-breaking he\r\nsubstituted useful and profitable work like clothes-making, laundry\r\nwork, bread-baking, wood-chopping, painting, and cleaning.\r\n\r\nFor every ton of oakum picked in the workhouse the ratepayers were\r\ninvolved in an expenditure of £10. The Guardians were often glad to get\r\nrid of the oakum when picked by returning it free to the firm supplying\r\nit. At the best they got 2s. 6d. per ton for it.\r\n\r\nTo a man like Crooks, holding firmly to Ruskin's theory that the\r\nemployment of persons on a useless business cannot relieve ultimate\r\ndistress, all work of that kind was wicked as well as wasteful.\r\n\r\nHe told his own Board so very plainly in 1895. It was a bitter winter.\r\nRiver and docks were frozen for weeks, closing the door against work to\r\nhalf the men in Poplar. The Guardians were besieged by starving\r\nfamilies. Well-nigh in despair the Board arranged that the relieving\r\nofficers should send the out-of-work men to break stones at three\r\nstoneyards specially opened in different parts of the district.\r\n\r\n\"It's a mistake,\" he argued. \"You are putting men to break stones which\r\nnobody wants. You are wasting men and money by inventing work which is\r\nutterly useless. Plenty of useful work can be found with care and\r\norganisation.\"\r\n\r\nAfter six disastrous weeks the Guardians admitted he was right. Only the\r\nworst class of men went into the stoneyards. He showed that this work of\r\nbreaking stones was costing £3 2s. 6d. per yard, whereas the work could\r\nbe done outside at trade union rate of wages for 2s. 6d. per yard.\r\n\r\nWhen the stoneyards were closed and it became known to the loafers\r\nthriving under the system that Crooks was responsible, they threatened\r\nhis life. These men knew they had been sent to the stoneyard simply to\r\njustify the Guardians in paying them wages. They grumbled and idled most\r\nof the time. Self-respecting men out of work refused to mix with them.\r\n\r\nSome time later Crooks joined with Canon Barnett, George Lansbury, and\r\nothers in a letter to the _Times_ and the Press generally, uttering a\r\nnote of warning to municipal authorities against \"made work\" for the\r\nunemployed. This joint letter stated:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Made work tends to be regarded as a source of relief rather than of\r\n     earnings. It is often as tempting to the idler as it is repugnant\r\n     to the self-respecting workman....\r\n\r\n     We would therefore submit that the municipalities which may decide\r\n     to take part in meeting present needs could best do so by leaving\r\n     distinctively \"relief\" duties to Guardians and other agencies; by\r\n     starting and carrying on, as good employers, works which have a\r\n     definite public advantage, and by requiring of each worker the best\r\n     work during a continuous period under thorough supervision.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most successful scheme for relieving distress with which Crooks was\r\nassociated in the severe winters of the early 'nineties was one on which\r\na dozen years later the Unemployed Act was based. It represented\r\nco-operation between a committee of citizens and the local authorities.\r\n\r\nThe Committee was formed in the first instance as a relief committee by\r\nthe Rector of Poplar. When Crooks joined at the rector's request and\r\nfound himself sitting among none but parsons, representing every\r\ndenomination in the district, he told them their first duty was to widen\r\ntheir ranks.\r\n\r\n\"You will never do anything so long as your committee is confined to\r\ngentlemen like these,\" he told the clerical chairman. \"What you need is\r\nto get hold of trade union secretaries and the secretaries of the\r\nfriendly and temperance societies and members of working men's clubs.\r\nThey will soon discriminate between the waster and the deserving man.\r\nThe waster is always boasting that parsons are so easily deceived.\"\r\n\r\nBesides the Labour men, representatives of other classes were invited to\r\njoin the committee. The Bishop of London and Canon Scott Holland backed\r\nup the Committee's appeal to the public for funds, and about £5,000 was\r\nraised to meet Poplar's needs.\r\n\r\nIt was amusing to see how often the working men members had to undeceive\r\nthe parsons. One good vicar tearfully brought forward several cases\r\nwhich the Labour men proved had been manufactured for him by\r\nprofessional cadgers.\r\n\r\n\"I have never known a distress committee to equal that one,\" was\r\nCrooks's verdict.\r\n\r\nIt taught him that a shilling given to an unemployed man for work done\r\nwas better than a sovereign given simply as charity.\r\n\r\nEver since he has steadily worked for the unemployed under that\r\nconviction. He changed that committee from a relief committee into a\r\ncommittee for providing work.\r\n\r\nIn its second winter he received an offer for the unemployed of £1,000\r\nfrom Mr. A. F. Hills, of the Thames Ironworks, on condition that he\r\nshould raise a similar sum. He took the offer at once to the Poplar\r\nDistrict Board, the precursor of the Borough Council. They agreed to\r\nvote another £1,000, and to put men to work on repaving roads and\r\nlime-whiting courts and alleys. So far was the local authority\r\nsatisfied with the way the work was done that, after spending Mr.\r\nHills's £1,000 in wages and the second £1,000 they themselves had\r\npromised, they voted another £3,000 during the prevalence of the\r\ndistress.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Crooks had brought about co-operation between the rector's\r\nDistress Committee and the local authority. The Committee went on as\r\nusual investigating the condition of families, with the great advantage\r\nof now being able to offer a job rather than relief to the out-of-work\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n\"When we came to starving families, as we did very often, we fed them up\r\nuntil the man was able to go to work. As soon as a man was able to work\r\nwe sent him to the local authority. If he failed to turn up for the\r\nwork, but came round later for relief, he got this answer: 'We can't\r\nafford to play the fool in this business. If you won't turn up to work\r\nyou can't be in distress. All we can do for you now is to put you at the\r\nbottom of our list. When we reach your name again we'll give you one\r\nmore chance. If you don't take the work then, don't come here any more.'\r\n\r\n\"Of course, the cost of the labour to the District Board was somewhat\r\nhigher than it would have been in the hands of skilled road-makers. You\r\nmust always allow for a loss due to the want of experience (as well as\r\nthe want of food) when you engage unemployed men. But remember we had a\r\nfree gift of £1,000 from Mr. Hills, which more than met the extra\r\nexpense, so that the ratepayers lost nothing. On the other hand, the\r\ncommunity got something that it needed. How much better, then, to pay\r\nthis little difference in price by employing out-of-work men on public\r\nworks than by giving them relief under the guise of stone-breaking,\r\nwhich costs the community over £3 per ton when it can be done in the\r\nopen market for 2s. 6d. a ton.\"\r\n\r\nThe winter that witnessed this scheme was described as \"a red-letter one\r\nin the history of the unemployed difficulty in the East End of London.\"\r\nThe words appear in the report of the Poplar District Board. In summing\r\nup what had been done, the Board further stated that \"on every ground\r\nmuch good has been accomplished and a valuable lesson learned.\" The\r\nBoard also thanked the local Relief Committee and Mr. Hills and Crooks\r\npersonally for their co-operation.\r\n\r\nThe lesson that had been learned saw fruit in the Unemployed Act a dozen\r\nyears later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nAGITATION IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS\r\n\r\n     How the Workless Man Degenerates--Pleading the Cause of the\r\n     Unemployed in the House--Creation of the Central Unemployed\r\n     Committee--Feeding the Starving out of the Rates--\"Would a Hen\r\n     bring 'em off?\"--A Letter from the Prime Minister--Crooks's\r\n     Rejoinder.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe interval was one of unwearied agitation. Of all his other pressing\r\npublic duties he gave first place to this of urging the State to deal\r\nwith the unemployed.\r\n\r\n\"This unemployed question is a terrible worry, Crooks,\" said a\r\nConservative member, walking with him out of the House of Commons into\r\nPalace Yard one evening.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Crooks replied as the other stepped into his motor car, \"it is a\r\nterrible worry when you have it for breakfast, dinner, tea, and supper.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the beginning of the winter of 1904. He had spent the afternoon\r\nin one of his interminable battles in Parliament urging that\r\npreparations should be made to act wisely instead of waiting until\r\npanic-stricken, and that the usual wild schemes for helping the\r\nunemployed would once again result in waste and demoralisation.\r\n\r\n\"I stood for a minute or two interested in the hurry and scurry of\r\npeople hastening to clubland, to dinner parties, and to theatres,\" he\r\nafterwards remarked when recalling the incident. \"Then, turning my back\r\non the West End, I wended my way eastward. Yes, a terrible worry the\r\nunemployed, and yet how few people seemed to realise it. Never-ending\r\nlines of conveyances, long queues of pleasure-seekers thronging the\r\ntheatre doors, all the externals of my surroundings pointed to\r\neverything but unemployment. But straight in front of me was my home in\r\nPoplar, and I knew that in a few more minutes I should be hearing a tale\r\nof some family's misery, considering myself a lucky man if I spent a few\r\nminutes indoors without someone calling to ask, 'Can you help to get me\r\na job?'\r\n\r\n\"Truly to some of us the unemployed are a terrible worry, not only in\r\nDecember, January, and February, but summer and winter, night and day,\r\nall the year round. But more terrible than the unemployed themselves is\r\nthe heart-breaking carelessness of the British public, which, generous\r\nto a fault, will not make up its mind until stirred by sensational\r\nappeals.\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, but,' some of my political opponents say to me, 'the unemployed\r\nare generally such a shiftless, good-for-nothing class. What good can\r\nyou expect to do with such men? I quite sympathise with your keenness,\r\nbut they are a very worthless, thankless lot, and you are wasting a lot\r\nof time over them.'\r\n\r\n\"Well, suppose we allow that as a class the unemployed retain a large\r\nmeasure of original sin. I know other classes possessing the same\r\nweakness, but neither class prejudices nor racial hatreds interest me\r\nvery much. So, for the sake of argument, we will say that the unemployed\r\nare very imperfect. This is one of the reasons why my Labour colleagues\r\nand I want to press home the importance of England making a praiseworthy\r\neffort to grapple with the problem. We see how quickly a workless man\r\ndeteriorates. A person out of work in October, unless promptly dealt\r\nwith, is in danger of becoming by the following March that social wreck\r\nknown as a loafer. And I object to loafers at both ends of the scale,\r\nwhether in Park Lane or in Poplar.\"\r\n\r\nIn the issue of _Vanity Fair_ containing \"Spy's\" popular cartoon of\r\nCrooks, the Labour member himself had an article on the unemployed.\r\n\r\n\"If _Vanity Fair_ will train the rich, the Labour men will guide the\r\npoor,\" he wrote. Further: \"Old England is as dear to the Labour man with\r\npoverty for his birthright as to the hereditary legislator with a county\r\nfor a heritage. But wealth, and the carelessness that wealth often\r\ninduces, are blind to the causes which heap misery and discontent upon\r\nthe people from generation to generation. To the wealthy the whole\r\nbusiness is a social phenomenon, but to us it is a permanent terror.\r\n\r\n\"And so, whatever our differences may appear to be, our Labour hopes are\r\nconcentrating upon sound practical methods by which the conditions and\r\nopportunities of the people shall be improved.\r\n\r\n\"You who read this are invited to remember that organised work is the\r\nfirst step which will separate the workman from demoralising charity,\r\nhis wife from the pawnshop, and his children from the streets. Sentiment\r\nand sympathy need no longer be the prey of the fawning cadger, or the\r\nvictim of hypocritical distress.\r\n\r\n\"To keep England in the forefront of the nations of the earth we must\r\nbegin in the homes of our people, there to raise a truly Imperial and\r\npatriotic race of good, healthy, honest men and women. The task is\r\nadmittedly a difficult one, for social reconstruction is as much moral\r\nas economic, but helping hands stretch out in every direction. The one\r\ngreat need is to change a national apathy into keen, sympathetic,\r\nwell-balanced criticism.\"\r\n\r\nHis agitation for the unemployed in the House of Commons, which formed\r\nthe main part of his parliamentary life for a couple of years, began\r\nwith the opening of the Session of 1904. He seconded Mr. Keir Hardie's\r\namendment to the Address, regretting, \"in view of distress arising from\r\nlack of employment,\" that no proposal was made for helping out-of-work\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nCrooks began his speech by declaring that mere relief schemes encouraged\r\nthe loafer. He knew well both the loafer and the man who was born tired.\r\nThe wife of one such got up early and wakened her husband in time for\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\"Is it raining?\" the man asked from the folds of the bedclothes.\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does it look like raining?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I wish it was Sunday.\"\r\n\r\nWith a sudden change of tone and manner, Crooks then went on to tell the\r\nHouse that if an able-bodied man out of a job was driven into the\r\nworkhouse, he generally remained a workhouse inmate for the rest of his\r\nlife. It degraded and demoralised him. It took away his muscle to stand\r\nup and fight for himself. If the Local Government Board would permit\r\nGuardians to take land, this man could be put to useful work. Even\r\nable-bodied men of the \"in-and-out\" type would be better for being put\r\nto work on the land under powers of compulsory detention. Of course,\r\nthese men should be allowed to go out if they really desired to look for\r\nother work. What they should not be allowed to do was to drag their\r\nwives and children about the country, vagrants bringing up more\r\nvagrants. Employment on farm colonies would quickly get rid of the tramp\r\ndifficulty. Such men, trained in useful agricultural work, if they felt\r\nthey had little chance in this country, would then have some equipment\r\nfor the colonies. A country like Canada, for instance, had no use for\r\nmen who had simply been loafing about English towns, but would very\r\nquickly find work for men who had had a little training and discipline\r\non the land. It would be better for the whole community that something\r\nof this sort should be done than that we should go on with the present\r\nsystem of doles and relief, whose effects, like idleness, only\r\ndemoralised.\r\n\r\nThe appeal to the House on that occasion fell on deaf ears.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1904 was made memorable to him by the creation of the\r\nCentral Unemployed Committee. For several years he had urged that the\r\nPoor Law Unions of London should be empowered to form a central\r\ncommittee to deal with the unemployed on well-organised lines. With the\r\nseveral Unions acting separately, confusion and waste followed on\r\nwell-meaning efforts. The genuine unemployed received little real help.\r\n\r\nFew public men took his scheme for a central organisation seriously at\r\nfirst. He was well-nigh worn out with his failures when unexpectedly the\r\nthen President of the Local Government Board came to his aid. Crooks,\r\nwith several other Members of Parliament, had waited upon Mr. Long in\r\ndeputation. The result was the calling together of the famous Unemployed\r\nConference at the Local Government Board on October 14th, 1904.\r\n\r\nTo that Conference the Poplar Guardians sent Crooks and Lansbury, armed\r\nwith a series of carefully-thought-out proposals. Some of them found a\r\nready acceptance on the part of Mr. Long. Others were adopted by the\r\nsucceeding Government.\r\n\r\nSince those Poplar proposals have already figured prominently in\r\nunemployed schemes and promise to appear in projects yet to be framed,\r\nthe substance of them is here set out:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     1. The President of the Local Government Board to combine the\r\n     London Unions for the purpose of dealing with the unemployed and\r\n     the unemployable.\r\n\r\n     2. Such central authority to take over the control of all\r\n     able-bodied inmates in London workhouses.\r\n\r\n     3. Farm colonies to be established by the central authority for\r\n     providing work.\r\n\r\n     4. Local Distress Committees to be also set up, consisting of\r\n     members of Borough Councils and Boards of Guardians, to work on the\r\n     lines already laid down by the Mansion House and the Poplar\r\n     Distress Committees.\r\n\r\n     5. The cost to these local committees of dealing with urgent need\r\n     occasioned by want of work to be a charge on the whole of London or\r\n     on the National Exchequer, instead of being a charge on the\r\n     locality, \"always provided that the payment given be for work done\r\n     on lines similar to those adopted by the Mansion House and the\r\n     Poplar Distress Committees.\"\r\n\r\n     6. Rural District Councils to be asked to supply the Local\r\n     Government Board with information when labourers are wanted on the\r\n     land, such information to be sent to the Local Distress Committees.\r\n\r\n     7. Parliament to take in hand the question of afforestation, the\r\n     reclamation of foreshores, and the building of sea walls along the\r\n     coast where the tide threatens encroachment.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately after the Whitehall Conference Mr. Long formed a\r\nCentral Unemployed Committee for London, personally arranging that\r\nCrooks and Lansbury should become members. He also advised the formation\r\nof local Distress Committees by the Poor Law and Municipal authorities.\r\n\r\nWhile Crooks was calling the nation's attention in Parliament and at\r\npublic meetings throughout the country to the wasteful and disorganised\r\nway in which we met these recurring periods of distress, he was making\r\nreasonable use of the local machinery at his hands.\r\n\r\nLittle could be done through the newly-formed committees in the way of\r\nproviding work during that winter. Want was felt keenly all over the\r\nEast End. Distress brooded over West Ham, for instance, like a black\r\ncloud. To such a plight was that district reduced owing to lack of work\r\nthat the _Daily Telegraph_ and the _Daily News_ between them raised\r\n£30,000 for relief.\r\n\r\nWest Ham's neighbour, Poplar, was in an equally bad plight, but there\r\nthe Guardians made an attempt to deal with the distress themselves. They\r\ngrappled boldly with a terrible state of things. The newspaper funds, by\r\nbringing bread to West Ham, saved that district, according to the\r\ntestimony of the local police superintendent, from serious rioting.\r\nPoplar, too, said the _Daily Mail_ at the time, was only saved from a\r\nseries of bread riots by the promptness of Will Crooks.\r\n\r\nHe talked into calmness a lean and clamorous crowd of starving men who\r\nswarmed into the Guardians' offices one day. He promised that their\r\nclaims should be considered and their cases investigated, and advised\r\nthem to go away quietly.\r\n\r\nPoplar fed its starving poor, and in doing so the Guardians did not\r\nhesitate to raise the rate for the time being by fourpence. In no single\r\ncase, however, was money given to families where the out-of-work husband\r\nwas under sixty years of age. All they got was a few shillings' worth\r\nof food, just enough to keep body and soul together until the husband\r\nfound work again. Had food not been given in this way, scores of\r\nfamilies would have been forced into the workhouse, where the cost of\r\ntheir keep would have been four or five times greater.\r\n\r\nIn the following winter, in face of similar distress, the same policy\r\nwas followed. It was mainly for thus feeding the starving that the\r\nPoplar Board was afterwards so violently attacked. But, given the like\r\ndistress, Crooks stoutly maintains he will apply the same remedy.\r\n\r\n\"The Poor Law is entrusted to us to prevent starvation,\" he holds. \"My\r\ndead friend and neighbour Dolling used to say that 'the law that\r\nsafeguards the poor is always in the hands of those who do not put it\r\ninto force.' So long as I live that shall not be said of Poplar.\"\r\n\r\nWith all the pressing claims of Poplar and his daily duties in\r\nParliament, together with the calls made upon his time by the London\r\nCounty Council and the Asylums Board, he was yet constant in his\r\nattendance at the Guildhall meetings of the Central Unemployed\r\nCommittee. He and Lansbury spared themselves in nothing on that\r\nCommittee. They believed that on its success depended the future of\r\nState-aid for the unemployed. They believed that such a crisis as they\r\nwere grappling with in Poplar in the winter of 1904 would never recur\r\nonce they got the State to recognise its duty to assist in organising\r\nuseful work for hard times.\r\n\r\n\"The lesson of all our work on Mr. Long's Unemployed Committee was\r\nthis,\" he told me. \"The only way to deal properly with the unemployed in\r\nwinter is to make your preparations in summer. The test of the Central\r\nUnemployed Committee will be the character of its organisation in good\r\ntimes. Only by being well organised when there is little distress will\r\nit prove a success when times are bad. It is far harder to organise\r\nuseful work for the unemployed through public bodies than it is to raise\r\nmoney for their relief.\"\r\n\r\nCrooks himself had seen the dark shadows of that winter creeping up\r\nominously in the previous summer. Before Parliament adjourned in August\r\nhe uttered a warning note in the House of Commons. He asked the Prime\r\nMinister whether the various Government Departments could not do\r\nsomething to prepare for the exceptional needs. Mr. Balfour's reply was\r\nto the effect that inquiries would be made.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, those inquiries!\" said Crooks, recalling the promise at a public\r\nmeeting in Woolwich. \"I've seen a good many inquiries and Royal\r\nCommissions in my time, and they always remind me of the East Ender who\r\nwent down Petticoat Lane on market day. He saw on a barrow some\r\nhard-boiled eggs which had been dyed various colours, evidently for\r\nchildren. He'd seen nothing like them before.\r\n\r\n\"'Wot kind of eggs is them?' says he.\r\n\r\n\"'Them? Them's pheasants' eggs,' says the coster.\r\n\r\n\"'Would a hen bring 'em off?'\r\n\r\n\"'Rather!'\r\n\r\n\"'How much for a sitting?'\r\n\r\n\"'Eighteenpence and half yer luck.'\r\n\r\n\"A month or two later the same man was down that way again. The coster\r\nsaw him.\r\n\r\n\"'Ain't you the bloke as bought them pheasants' eggs?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes.'\r\n\r\n\"'How'd yer get on?'\r\n\r\n\"'Well,' he says mournful like, 'that old hen sat and sat and sat until\r\nI'm blowed if she didn't cook them pheasants' eggs at last.'\r\n\r\n\"And,\" added Crooks, \"I have never known a Royal Commission or a\r\nGovernment Inquiry yet that didn't sit and sit and sit until its report\r\nwas cooked by the time it had done with it.\"\r\n\r\nAs the distress deepened with the approach of winter, the Poplar\r\nGuardians pressed for an Autumn Session of Parliament. They wrote to the\r\nGovernment welcoming Mr. Long's scheme of Distress Committees, but\r\ndoubting their efficacy unless power was granted to raise a halfpenny\r\nrate for providing the unemployed with work.\r\n\r\nAs Chairman of the Board, Crooks himself wrote a long letter to the\r\nPrime Minister on November 21st. He supplied official figures, showing\r\nthe exceptional distress then prevailing, and pointed out that the\r\nGuardians' request for an Autumn Session was supported by fifty-six\r\nother Poor Law Unions and no fewer than eighty municipalities throughout\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nTo that letter Mr. Balfour sent the following reply:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     10, Downing Street, Whitehall, S.W. _November 28th, 1904._\r\n\r\n     DEAR MR. CROOKS,--\r\n\r\n     I am well aware that in many parts of the metropolis--and more\r\n     particularly, I fear, in the district in which as a Guardian you\r\n     are immediately concerned--much temporary distress prevails at the\r\n     present moment.\r\n\r\n     How best to deal with the situation thus created has, as you know,\r\n     been the subject of most anxious consideration on the part of the\r\n     President of the Local Government Board; and Mr. Walter Long has\r\n     established a scheme--now, I understand, in actual working--which\r\n     will have the effect of organising and generalising methods which\r\n     local experience has already proved to be useful, thereby greatly\r\n     increasing both their economy and their efficiency.\r\n\r\n     You are, I gather, of opinion that this by itself is not\r\n     sufficient, and you suggest that a special Session of Parliament is\r\n     required to meet the emergency. I would venture, however, to make\r\n     two remarks on this project. In the first place, I think we ought\r\n     to wait and see how far the new machinery fulfils the hope of its\r\n     designers; and, in the second place, I think we should abstain from\r\n     basing exaggerated hopes upon anything which may be immediately\r\n     accomplished by Parliamentary debates. These are invaluable for the\r\n     purpose of criticising legislative proposals or executive action.\r\n     They may educate the public mind. They may prepare the way for a\r\n     constructive policy. They can hardly, however, frame one. And, so\r\n     far as I can judge, an abstract discussion upon the general\r\n     situation would not only be of little present value to those whom\r\n     it is intended to benefit, but it would do them a positive injury.\r\n     Organised effort would be paralysed till the decision of Parliament\r\n     was known; and between the beginning of our debates and the moment\r\n     when their result could be embodied in a working shape much\r\n     preventable suffering would inevitably have occurred.\r\n\r\n     Yours very truly,\r\n     ARTHUR JAMES BALFOUR.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his reply on behalf of the Guardians, Crooks said:\r\n\r\n\"From a purely academic standpoint your argument is doubtless correct;\r\nbut while Mr. Long's scheme does, in a general way, show a departure in\r\nthe direction of making London a unit for dealing with the unemployed,\r\nyet it has no power to enforce contributions from anyone. Thus all poor\r\nparts, where work-people are aggregated, have to bear abnormal burdens\r\nwhich should be shared, if not by the nation, then at least by the\r\nmetropolis.\r\n\r\n\"The position in this district has reached a stage where something\r\nimmediate has to be done, and the only course open to the Guardians is\r\nto meet the numerous applications made to them by grants of out-door\r\nrelief. The total amount of out-door relief now being granted by the\r\nGuardians exceeds £690 per week, and is borne entirely by local rates,\r\nwhich already stand at 10s. in the £, and will considerably increase by\r\nthe addition of this extra relief.\r\n\r\n\"If the public were assured that the problem would be seriously taken up\r\nby his Majesty's Government at an early date, funds might be forthcoming\r\nto bridge over the present period of anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"The Guardians desire to emphasise the fact that this question of\r\ndealing with the unemployed has been several times before Parliament,\r\nand if the Government really desire to grapple with this great evil,\r\nthey could, in a short time, with the expert advice at the disposal of\r\nthe Government, set in operation a great deal of work useful to the\r\nnation. The Guardians, therefore, sincerely hope that their previous\r\nrepresentations will be acted upon, and that you will give an assurance\r\nthat the matter shall be laid before Parliament at the earliest possible\r\nmoment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE QUEEN INTERVENES\r\n\r\n     A Breakdown from Overwork--Health Permanently Impaired--Appointment\r\n     of a Royal Commission on the Poor Law--Saving the Unemployed\r\n     Bill--Need of Money to Work the Bill--Mrs. Crooks heads the Women's\r\n     March to Whitehall--Mr. Balfour's Sympathetic but Unsatisfactory\r\n     Reply--Queen Alexandra's Intervention--A Vote of Money in the New\r\n     Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe labour and anxiety, the long arduous days and the sleepless nights\r\nCrooks endured that winter for the unemployed, culminated in a sudden\r\nand serious illness.\r\n\r\nThe attack was short, but dangerous. His doctor reported that unless a\r\nchange took place within a few hours it would be a case for confinement\r\nto bed for at least three months. Fortunately, the welcome change came.\r\n\r\nA few days before he took to his bed he got a severe shaking by a fall\r\nwhile jumping off a 'bus in the Strand. That was not the cause of his\r\nillness, however. The real cause, as his medical man declared, was\r\nnervous breakdown due to overwork. His overwork had all been in the\r\ndirection of trying to get work for the unemployed.\r\n\r\nHe fretted himself into a worse condition during the first few days of\r\nhis illness. Every night, instead of sleeping, he was mentally putting\r\nhosts of unemployed men to work.\r\n\r\nThe sympathy and affection shown during his illness by his neighbours at\r\nPoplar affected him deeply. All day long callers of all sorts and\r\nconditions were making inquiries and leaving messages of good-will.\r\nLabourers, mechanics, widows, children, tradesmen, public men,\r\nofficials, Free Church ministers, Anglican clergymen, Roman Catholic\r\npriests, and Sisters of the Poor were among those who came to the door\r\nonce the news leaked out that the man from their midst, whom they had so\r\noften delighted to honour, lay sick and in danger. Their sympathy was\r\nintensified by the knowledge that Mrs. Crooks herself had not wholly\r\nrecovered from a serious operation that had kept her for weeks in\r\nhospital.\r\n\r\nThat breakdown shattered him for life. He has never been the same in\r\nhealth since, and knows he can never be the same again. Sometimes for\r\nweeks together he endures agonising nervous pains, deprived of sleep and\r\nrest, yet all the time steadily refusing to slacken his labours for\r\nthose whom he is fond of calling \"the people at our end of the town.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was able to get out again in the New Year (1905), he took\r\nup the case for the unemployed, if not with all his former zeal,\r\ncertainly with all the zeal he could then command.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of January he had so far recovered as to be able to\r\nattend the Liverpool Conference of the Labour Representation Committee.\r\nHe was then in a position to make public for the first time that the\r\nKing's Speech at the opening of Parliament in the following month would\r\nin all likelihood promise an Unemployed Bill. On his motion the\r\nConference decided:\r\n\r\n\r\n     That the policy of the Labour Party in Parliament relating to\r\n     unemployment should be to secure fuller powers for the local\r\n     authorities to acquire and use land, to re-organise the local\r\n     administrative machinery for dealing with poverty and unemployment,\r\n     to bring pressure on the Government to put the recommendations of\r\n     the Afforestation Committee into effect, to undertake forthwith,\r\n     through the Board of Trade, the reclamation of foreshores, and to\r\n     create a Labour Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis forecast of the King's Speech proved correct. An Unemployed Bill was\r\npromised. It was introduced on April 18th by Mr. Gerald Balfour, who had\r\nsucceeded Mr. Long at the Local Government Board. The Bill confirmed Mr.\r\nLong's scheme of Distress Committees in London, and provided for the\r\nformation of similar bodies in provincial towns. It granted the\r\nprinciple of State aid by permitting the cost of organisation, including\r\nthe provision of farm colonies, to be charged to the rates, leaving it\r\nto voluntary subscriptions to provide a fund for paying the men's wages.\r\n\r\nThat Session was made memorable to Crooks in another sense. A Royal\r\nCommission on the Poor Law was appointed, and although it was little\r\nfaith he had in Commissions generally, he believed that, whatever came\r\nof the recommendations of this one, it would help the people of England\r\nto see, while its investigations were going on, something of the cruelty\r\nand folly of a system which had been ruthlessly thrust upon the voteless\r\nlabouring people by the middle class individualists who came into power\r\nafter the Reform Act of 1832. His fellow Guardian, George Lansbury, was\r\nappointed a member of the Commission--a notable compliment to Poplar,\r\nwhich for a dozen years had striven to make this soulless system humane\r\nand helpful.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Unemployed Bill passed second reading with a majority of\r\n217, the Session dragged wearily on with little prospect of its getting\r\nthrough the Committee stage and becoming law. When August dawned and the\r\nHouse found itself within a week of adjournment, everyone but Crooks\r\ndespaired of getting the measure through. The Prime Minister told the\r\nHouse there was no time for the Bill. Several of Crooks's Labour\r\ncolleagues declared the Bill to be too meagre a thing to fight for.\r\n\r\n\"I admit its faults and shortcomings as readily as anyone,\" he argued\r\nwith his Party; \"but it contains the germ of a great principle--State\r\nrecognition of the need and State aid in carrying out the organisation.\"\r\n\r\nAlmost alone he fought for the Bill in the last days of the Session. He\r\nurged the Government to save the unemployed from foolish and useless\r\nrioting by holding out to them the hope which the passing of the Bill\r\nwould convey.\r\n\r\nBy a dramatic coincidence, on the very afternoon he was thus warning\r\nthe Government the police were charging a crowd of desperate unemployed\r\nin Manchester.\r\n\r\n\"The Prime Minister urges the plea that there is no time,\" Crooks went\r\non to tell the House. \"What would the business men of this House think,\r\nwhen they went down to their offices to-morrow, if they were told by the\r\nmanager that grouse-shooting would begin on the Twelfth and that\r\ntherefore business would have to be suspended? Does the Government\r\nprefer grouse-shooting to finding work for honest men? Was this Bill of\r\ntheirs only introduced to kill time--to wait until the birds were big\r\nenough to be shot? I don't want to stop your holidays. Go and kill your\r\ngrouse and your partridges. But are you going to put dead birds before\r\nliving men?\r\n\r\n\"There was the day on which the Eton and Harrow match was played. What\r\nwill the unemployed say when they hear that the Government could not\r\nfind time to discuss this Bill because Ministers wished to see two\r\nschools play cricket? Do you think the working man gets a day off to see\r\nhis sons play cricket in the public parks? Unlike many hon. members of\r\nthis House, workmen do not live by dividends. They have nothing to sell\r\nbut their labour. When out of work a little help often saves them from\r\nruin and pauperism. They are only asking to be given an opportunity to\r\nfulfil the Divine curse by earning their living in the sweat of their\r\nbrow.\"\r\n\r\nHis appeal went home. The following day the Government sprang a\r\nsurprise on the House. The Bill would be taken that week. It was passed\r\nwithin a few days. \"H. W. M.,\" in his parliamentary sketch in the _Daily\r\nNews_ of August 5th, referring to what he called \"the strange story of\r\nthe passing of the Unemployed Bill,\" said:\r\n\r\n\r\n     At the end of last week its chances seemed to have disappeared.\r\n     To-day it has passed Committee, and Monday will see it through the\r\n     Commons. The Member chiefly responsible for this issue is Mr.\r\n     Crooks, who has shown undoubted subtleness as a Parliamentary\r\n     tactician.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his final speech on the Bill, Crooks argued that even the loafer\r\nwould become a better man by being given, not the charity that\r\ndemoralised, but a day's work for a day's pay. Such a man, by being put\r\non a farm colony for a few months, would be turned into a good citizen.\r\nHe stood for discipline in Labour as the Government stood for discipline\r\nin the Army and Navy. He wanted to preserve the manhood of the nation\r\nrather than to see it degraded, as it was by the present system of\r\ndespising an unemployed man. The type of men who hung idle about all our\r\nlarge towns was the type that filled the workhouses and prisons. Take\r\nthem in their early stages of unemployment, put them under proper\r\ndiscipline on the land, and he was prepared to prophesy they would\r\nbecome useful citizens. It was a loss to the nation that men and women\r\nshould be going about without the common necessaries owing to being out\r\nof work.\r\n\r\nSo the Bill went through, and people of all classes agree with his old\r\nfriend, Mr. A. F. Hills, a large employer, who wrote to him a letter on\r\nthe subject, ending with the words: \"I believe that generations yet\r\nunborn will in the years to come rise up and call you blessed.\"\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of many people well able to gauge the distress and\r\ndiscontent of the country, the Act came just in time to prevent serious\r\ndisorders in the large towns. For the winter that immediately followed\r\nfound the unemployed in a worse plight than ever.\r\n\r\nPromptly the Distress Committees formed under the Act got to work. The\r\nLondon Committees found themselves at first stranded for funds. The weak\r\npoint in the Act was that which allowed only the expense of organisation\r\nto be made a public charge. The Committees found themselves asking, What\r\nwas the use of organising work for the unemployed when there were no\r\nmeans of paying wages? It looked as though public subscriptions were not\r\nto be forthcoming. Was the Act, so hardly won, to fail on its first\r\ntrial?\r\n\r\nAgain Poplar fought the cause of the poor for the whole country. This\r\ntime the workless men's wives took action. The women of Poplar met in\r\nthe Town Hall, Mrs. Crooks in the chair, with the object of urging\r\nParliament to vote money to the Distress Committees set up under the new\r\nAct.\r\n\r\nMrs. Crooks, as reported in the _Times_, said:\r\n\r\n\r\n     They were endeavouring to enlist the help and sympathy of those in\r\n     high places to give some little time to the consideration of the\r\n     claims of the wives and children of men who were willing to work,\r\n     but who were unable to find the wherewithal to feed those near and\r\n     dear to them. The Queen had more than once shown her desire to\r\n     help. Was it, then, too much to expect that their wealthy sisters\r\n     would use their influence with their all-too-powerful husbands to\r\n     appeal, with the women of Poplar, to the King and Government to\r\n     call Parliament together with a view to passing estimates to enable\r\n     work to be undertaken--work that would give them their daily bread?\r\n     Theirs was a cry for national defence, and Parliament must see to\r\n     it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe meeting decided to petition the King to instruct the Prime Minister\r\nto call Parliament together. In acknowledging a vote of thanks to his\r\nwife for taking the chair, Crooks said the mothers and sisters had\r\nremained too long indoors, suffering in silence. If the King could see\r\nthat meeting it would make him realise what unemployment meant to the\r\nwives and mothers of his industrial army, and he would no doubt do\r\nsomething to ensure that they should not lack the sustenance needed to\r\nbring up strong daughters and strong sons as faithful and loyal\r\ncitizens. They had got the machinery, and they had got certain powers,\r\nbut they needed funds. They had got an organisation that could gather up\r\nall the information as to useful work that needed doing--work that would\r\nbe profitable and inspiring to the men who did it, instead of being\r\ndegrading, like the foolish and useless and expensive task-work which\r\nwas all the Poor Law had to offer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MR. & MRS. WILL CROOKS\r\n\r\n_Photo: G. Dendry._]\r\n\r\nAbout a month later took place the memorable women's march to Whitehall.\r\nThe day, November 6th, was truly a tragic and historic one in the\r\nsocial life of London.\r\n\r\nHeaded by Mrs. Crooks and the then Mayoress of Poplar (Mrs. Dalton),\r\nsome six thousand poor women gathered on the Thames Embankment, near\r\nCharing Cross Bridge, and marched to the offices of the Local Government\r\nBoard in order to back up their appeal to the Premier to aid their\r\nout-of-work husbands and brothers. The women came not only from Poplar,\r\nwhere the march had been organised by George Lansbury, but from\r\nEdmonton, Paddington, West Ham, Woolwich, and Southwark. Some carried\r\ninfants in arms; others had children dragging at their skirts.\r\n\r\n\"Work for our men--Bread for our children.\" So ran the appeal on the\r\nbanner that floated above the Southwark contingent, led by Mrs. Herbert\r\nStead.\r\n\r\nThe Embankment was deep in mud, and, as the women trudged bravely\r\nthrough it--those carrying babies unable to save their skirts from\r\ndragging in the road--the scene was one that filled you with an\r\nindignant shame. Even those other women in motors and carriages, who had\r\ndriven down to see the sight out of curiosity, sank back into their\r\ncushions aghast, sickened, ashamed at this spectacle of their sisters'\r\nplight.\r\n\r\nIn Whitehall the processionists told off a dozen of their number to form\r\nthe deputation to Mr. Balfour. The women were accompanied into the Local\r\nGovernment Board offices by Crooks and Lansbury and two or three other\r\nmen from the Central Workers' Unemployed Committee.\r\n\r\nThe object of the visit was explained by Lansbury, and then a working\r\nwoman from Poplar read the women's memorial. The memorial spoke of the\r\nmisery, degradation, and desperation of the women which had driven them\r\nto determine to bear their lot in silence no longer. They thought that\r\nParliament should make it impossible for unscrupulous employers to grind\r\nthe faces of the poor. The Government had gone to the aid of the\r\ntenantry of Ireland. The plight of the poor in London was worse. If war\r\nwere threatened, ways would be found for raising money. The country was\r\nfaced with a worse evil than war in the presence of starving citizens.\r\nIn the name of their country, their homes, and their children, they\r\nappealed to the Prime Minister not to send them empty away.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the workless men's wives who, it had been arranged, should\r\nspeak broke down; so Mrs. Crooks explained they had not come to utter\r\nwords only; they had come as Englishwomen, driven to despair, in the\r\nhope that the Premier, as the chief Minister of the King, would no\r\nlonger leave them in a worse condition than that of his dogs and horses.\r\n\r\nMr. Balfour was sympathetic, but had nothing to suggest. He saw no hope\r\nof Parliament voting money. The deputation came away sullen and\r\ndisappointed. For the time it looked as though the women's march had\r\nbeen in vain. But, before a week passed, another woman spoke. The need\r\nwas met by Queen Alexandra. On November 13th her Majesty issued her\r\nfamous appeal:\r\n\r\n\"I appeal to all charitably disposed people in the Empire, both men and\r\nwomen, to assist me in alleviating the suffering of the poor starving\r\nunemployed during this winter. For this purpose I head the list with\r\n£2,000.\"\r\n\r\nBefore the winter was over the public, in response to this appeal,\r\nsubscribed £150,000--a sum that proved sufficient that winter to keep\r\nDistress Committees going in London and elsewhere during the time of\r\ngreatest privation.\r\n\r\nThe needs of the next winter were provided for by the State. The new\r\nLiberal Government had not been in office many months before it voted\r\n£200,000 to the Distress Committees appointed under the Unemployed Act.\r\n\r\nPoplar had done its work. The women had marched to victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nHOME LIFE AND SOME ENGAGEMENTS\r\n\r\n     Crooks becomes a Grandfather--A Glimpse of his Home Life--Mr. G. R.\r\n     Sims on \"A Morning with Will Crooks\"--Crooks's Daily\r\n     Post-bag--Sample Letters--Speaking at Religious and Temperance\r\n     Meetings--On Adult Sunday Schools--On the Licensing Bill--A Homily\r\n     to Free Churchmen.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy this time Crooks had moved from Northumberland Street to Gough\r\nStreet, a few minutes' walk away. The change was from a five-roomed\r\nhouse to a six-roomed house, \"with exactly three and a half feet more\r\nspace for a garden at the back,\" as he jocularly described it.\r\n\r\nHis two eldest daughters had both married, and his eldest son, who was\r\ndoing well at the same trade his father learnt--that of cooper--had also\r\nsettled down to married life in Poplar. This son had the pleasure one\r\nday of telephoning to his father at the County Council offices, just\r\nafter the latter had passed his fiftieth birthday, \"You became a\r\ngrandfather this morning. Cheer up!\"\r\n\r\nAnother daughter qualified at the Cheltenham Training College as a\r\nschool teacher. The youngest daughter elected to be \"mother's right hand\r\nat home.\" The youngest son was apprenticed in a Thames shipbuilding\r\nyard.\r\n\r\nOf his children he would often remark, during the controversy over\r\nreligious education in schools, that they seemed to disprove the\r\ntheories of both contending parties. One of his daughters and a son, who\r\nwere educated in Board Schools, became communicating members of the\r\nChurch of England, while two daughters educated in Church of England\r\nschools afterwards became Nonconformists.\r\n\r\nA glimpse of his home life was given in the \"Celebrities at Home\"\r\nseries, published in the _World_. The writer described Gough Street as a\r\nrow of tiny houses so much alike that the only difference between one\r\nand another was the number on the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n     But if you did not know Mr. Crooks's number, you could guess his\r\n     house by waiting at the corner of the street. Because, between\r\n     half-past nine and half-past ten, the door-knocker of No. 81 will\r\n     beat a tattoo twelve or twenty times to the hour, when all the\r\n     other knockers are silent. For this is the hour when Mr. Crooks is\r\n     at home and receives his visitors, while he takes his breakfast in\r\n     a spasmodic and interrupted manner--bad, one feels sure, for his\r\n     digestion. They are not social callers. They come because they want\r\n     something--an order for free medicine or for an artificial limb,\r\n     for advice as to a likely quarter to get work, for a hundred and\r\n     one needs of poor people who have no resources of their own.\r\n\r\n     They are pleasant rooms in which the Labour member finds the best\r\n     happiness of his life. They are not large. They are not handsomely\r\n     furnished, for a Labour member has no need of luxury; but to Mr.\r\n     Crooks every little adornment in them has its own story to tell and\r\n     its own pleasant memory. On one of the walls are two oil paintings\r\n     of ships in distress--\"good or bad,\" says Mr. Crooks, \"I'm no\r\n     judge,\" But they are valuable to him, because they were painted by\r\n     a man down on his luck, as a thanksgiving for a good turn done to\r\n     him by the only friend he had.\r\n\r\n     \"Bless you,\" says Mr. Crooks, \"they all bring me little things, and\r\n     I can't refuse them. See that champagne glass on the piano? That\r\n     was given me by a poor old lady I used to look after a bit. That\r\n     wine glass on the other side came from another old friend. Someone\r\n     will bring me a China shepherd, another a vase or candlestick, or a\r\n     comic pig. It's pleasant, you know!\"...\r\n\r\n     Mr. Crooks is one of the pleasantest and most interesting men to\r\n     visit. If you take him at the right time--half-past nine\r\n     o'clock--it means an early journey from the West!--he will sit you\r\n     down to a plate of porridge and give you more information about the\r\n     life of the working-classes in the course of an hour than the most\r\n     laborious reading of Blue-books will do in a lifetime.\r\n\r\n     The visitor must be prepared for interruptions. In a corner of the\r\n     breakfast-room is a member of the family who likes to have his say.\r\n     It is a poll-parrot--\"as cunning as a barge-load of monkeys,\" says\r\n     his owner affectionately. He has a peculiar habit of cracking\r\n     invisible filbert-nuts at the back of his throat, rather\r\n     disconcerting to a stranger; and although he dotes on Mr. Crooks,\r\n     it is a little game of his to snub the Labour member by\r\n     depreciatory remarks and scornful whistles of derision. But he\r\n     always has an affectionate \"Goo'-bye, Will!\" for his master when he\r\n     puts on his hat in the morning. To Mrs. Crooks he is always\r\n     courteous. \"Goo'-morning, mother!\" he says, when the lady comes\r\n     down to breakfast, and thrusts his beak out for a kiss. Then he\r\n     calls \"Tilly! Tilly!\" in a shrill voice, like an elderly landlady,\r\n     and is not satisfied till Mrs. Crooks's pretty, black-eyed daughter\r\n     has given him his morning greeting.\r\n\r\n     \"He has his little prejudices, like the rest of us,\" says Mr.\r\n     Crooks. \"He can't abide babies, and squawks at them fearfully.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. George R. Sims gave a sketch of \"A Morning with Will Crooks\" in the\r\n_Daily Chronicle_ of May 2nd, 1906. He suggested that if 81, Gough\r\nStreet--Crooks's Castle, as he called it--had a brass plate on the door,\r\nthe most appropriate device to be inscribed upon it would be, \"Inquire\r\nwithin upon everything.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     It was twenty minutes past ten when I arrived. At half-past ten we\r\n     were due at the relieving office. But before we started, some three\r\n     or four pathetic narratives had found their way into the little\r\n     hall for Mr. Crooks to mark, learn, and inwardly digest.\r\n\r\n     I appreciated the situation, and expressed sympathy.\r\n\r\n     \"It is depressing,\" said the people's M.P., \"but, after all,\r\n     somebody's got to listen and somebody's got to help.\"\r\n\r\n     We went out into the street. In the hundred yards that we walked to\r\n     our destination six sad riddles of life were submitted to Mr.\r\n     Crooks for solution.\r\n\r\n     The broad-shouldered, black-bearded, smiling politician of the\r\n     people had a cheery word of advice for all applicants, and scarcely\r\n     had these pavement consultations ended before we were seated in the\r\n     relieving office listening to tales of woe told by a procession of\r\n     poor petitioners with whom the world had gone woefully wrong.\r\n\r\n     The committee of relief were generous and sympathetic. Poplar has a\r\n     reputation for generosity in this matter. It struck me that at\r\n     times the committee might have impressed a little more earnestly\r\n     upon the recipients of out-relief the other side of the situation;\r\n     but I am bound to admit that undeserving cases--cases which had a\r\n     history of drink and thriftlessness--were dismissed with no\r\n     illusions....\r\n\r\n     We went to the workhouse at the dinner hour. A comfortable place\r\n     certainly, and the dinner probably better than a good many of the\r\n     inmates had been accustomed to when they were earning their own\r\n     living....\r\n\r\n     A pleasant hour with Mr. and Mrs. Crooks and their daughters at\r\n     the castle, a stroll in the little garden which is Mrs. Crooks's\r\n     delight, a short interview with Tommy the Tortoise, and it is time\r\n     for the Member for Woolwich to start for Westminster and take his\r\n     place in the National Assembly.\r\n\r\n     He takes up a leather case containing some sixty or seventy letters\r\n     to be answered, and we go out into the street, which is happily\r\n     bathed in sunshine. We get on the top of an omnibus, and I listen\r\n     to the merry stories merrily told until we arrive at Aldgate\r\n     Station and bid each other good-bye.\r\n\r\n     I have spent a most interesting and instructive morning with a\r\n     typical Englishman, a man who has laboured with skill and used his\r\n     brains as well as his hands to good purpose--a man who has fought\r\n     his way up from boyhood, a man whose heart is as big as his\r\n     shoulders are broad.\r\n\r\n     Beyond his sterling common sense and his sympathy with suffering,\r\n     Will Crooks has one golden quality in a tribune of the people. He\r\n     has a sense of humour. It does your eyes good to see him smile. And\r\n     he has a laugh that makes you feel the sunshine even when the north\r\n     wind blows.\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes the Labour man has nearly a hundred letters a day to deal\r\nwith. First attention is always given to those from people seeking\r\ncounsel or help in Poplar and Woolwich.\r\n\r\nAn old man of ninety-four asks him to visit him for old times' sake. A\r\nwidow has lost her property--will Mr. Crooks see her righted? A sick\r\nwoman wants to know how she can get into a convalescent home. An anxious\r\nfather asks him to speak to a wayward son, because \"the lad sets such\r\nstore by what you say, Mr. Crooks.\" Again, it is a distracted mother\r\nwho writes, maybe about a son or a daughter who has run away or fallen\r\ninto trouble.\r\n\r\nAmusing letters come sometimes, varying the note of sorrow sounded in so\r\nmany of the others. This, for instance, from a sympathetic Frenchman,\r\nwho evidently imagines that a place called Poplar must be studded with\r\ntrees of that name and surrounded by open fields. \"I see,\" wrote this\r\nsympathiser from across the Channel, \"that you are doing much for the\r\nunemployed, and I have pleasure in sending you enclosed cheque for them.\r\nI would suggest, in view of the importance of the poor children having\r\npure milk, that the money be spent in putting unemployed men to work in\r\ncleaning out the ponds in the fields and lanes of Poplar where the\r\ncattle drink.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Crooks is essentially a home-loving man, counting it one of his\r\nchief joys to have an evening free or a week-end to call his own, he\r\nregards it as a duty to speak at religious and temperance meetings, and\r\non behalf of other movements not necessarily allied with the Labour\r\nParty.\r\n\r\nOne day finds him with the Bishop of London at the Mansion House meeting\r\nof the United Temperance Council. Another day he is speaking with the\r\nPresident of the Baptist Union, the Rev. John Wilson, one of his best\r\nsupporters in Woolwich, at the Union's annual gathering. Another day he\r\nis congratulating Canon Hensley Henson, at the annual meeting of the\r\nLondon Wesleyan Mission, on having \"six of his parishioners on the\r\nplatform\"--a reference to the presence of half a dozen members of\r\nParliament, Canon Henson being rector of the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nAfter addressing the Baptist Union on a second occasion, a letter came\r\nto him from the secretary, the Rev. J. H. Shakespeare:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     On behalf of the Council of the Baptist Union and on my own behalf\r\n     I beg to thank you most warmly for the magnificent services you\r\n     rendered to us last Tuesday night. It was delightful to hear you. I\r\n     personally was very curious to see you managing a dense crowd of\r\n     men. It does not seem to me that there is any reason why you should\r\n     ever stop drawing from the rich and endless resources of your\r\n     eloquence and wit and your wise sayings.\r\n\r\n     I feel very deeply indebted to you for having kept your engagement\r\n     under such trying circumstances, and I hope you were not too\r\n     fatigued afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nA different letter was one from his old friend the Hon. and Rev. J. G.\r\nAdderley, announcing his call to Birmingham:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Alas! I leave dear old London on November 2nd. Thank you for all\r\n     you have been to me during my time here. I have known you now\r\n     fifteen years.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe many occasions on which he addressed working men at adult Sunday\r\nschools in different parts of the country forced him to this conclusion,\r\nto which he gave public expression:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     The adult school movement has, I do sincerely believe, done more to\r\n     make men understand that Brotherhood is not merely a word, but a\r\n     real living thing, than any other movement of recent days. Men\r\n     under the influence of adult schools now begin to see that their\r\n     whole life on earth does not consist merely in eating, drinking,\r\n     and working and going to a place of worship, but in taking a\r\n     living part in God's work personally--in a word, in striving for\r\n     some of Christ's ideals on earth as in Heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe assisted at conducting something like an adult school in Poplar.\r\nBesides the Sunday morning meetings at the Dock Gates, the Labour\r\nLeague, in conjunction with the Rector of Poplar, carry on a winter\r\nseries of addresses at the Town Hall on Sunday afternoons, to which\r\nCrooks and his friend, Mr. Fred Butler, give a good deal of their time.\r\nOf these Town Hall meetings he wrote in the article he contributed to\r\nthe volume of essays on \"Christianity and the Working Classes\":--\r\n\r\n\r\n     The meetings are always crowded with working-men and their wives\r\n     and working girls and lads. The rector or myself takes the\r\n     chair--often we are both on the platform together. The gatherings\r\n     are not religious in the orthodox sense, nor is any attempt made to\r\n     teach religion, but I venture to say they have as much influence\r\n     for good on the work-people of Poplar as many of the churches. We\r\n     nearly always begin with music by singers or players who give their\r\n     services, and then we have a \"talk,\" generally by a public man, on\r\n     social questions, on education, on books, and authors, and\r\n     citizenship. Some of our speakers take Biblical subjects.\r\n\r\n     Thus every week we get together a good company of work-people who\r\n     ordinarily attend no place of worship on Sunday; and if nothing\r\n     more, we keep them out of the public-house, we make them think for\r\n     themselves, we awaken some sense of citizenship. The presence of\r\n     the rector has convinced many, who were formerly hostile to all\r\n     parsons, Anglican and Nonconformist, that the Churches and Labour\r\n     can work in harmony. Without pretending to be this, that, or the\r\n     other, our gatherings have made for the love of one's neighbour,\r\n     and therefore for the cause of Christ.\r\n\r\n\r\nNearly every P.S.A. and adult school and men's Sunday meeting in London\r\nwanted him. He would be at the Whitefield Tabernacle one Sunday, at the\r\nLeysian Mission another, at Dr. Clifford's church another.\r\n\r\nThe demands made upon him by temperance bodies redoubled after the\r\nintroduction of the Licensing Bill of 1904, of which he was an\r\nuncompromising opponent. In nearly all his temperance addresses, full as\r\nthey were of his humorous fancies, he denounced the practice, followed\r\nby so many temperance reformers, of making cheap jests at the men or\r\nwomen whom drink has degraded.\r\n\r\n\"We who can overcome temptation should be the last to make light of\r\nthose who have failed to overcome temptation. Rather should we use our\r\ngreater power to assist them.\"\r\n\r\nWhat he said from public platforms he did not hesitate to repeat on the\r\nfloor of the House of Commons. Speaking after Mr. Balfour, in one of the\r\ndebates on the Licensing Bill, he said:--\r\n\r\n\"I wish to take the opportunity, while the Prime Minister is in the\r\nHouse, to say a few words on the question of temptation, because the\r\nimpression left on my mind by the remarks of the right hon. gentleman is\r\nthat every man who indulges in drink is capable of taking care of\r\nhimself and of overcoming the drink habit by his own efforts. I hold\r\nthat there are thousands of our fellow-men and women who cannot resist\r\ntemptation when the opportunity to drink is put in their way. No doubt\r\nif everyone had the moral fibre of the Prime Minister there would be\r\nlittle need for a measure of temperance reform. Those hon. members who\r\nattend prayers at the opening of the proceedings of this House listen to\r\nthe words, 'Lead us not into temptation.' I ask the Prime Minister\r\nwhether he has ever thought that the thousands of people in our asylums\r\nthrough drink are there because they are capable of looking after\r\nthemselves? No; it is because temptation has been too much for them.\r\nDoes not that involve an obligation on the State to take temptation out\r\nof their way?\"\r\n\r\nThe National Free Church Council invited him to address their annual\r\ngathering in 1906. The Council met in Birmingham in March, and the\r\nPresident (the Rev. J. Scott Lidgett), in introducing Crooks, said the\r\ninvitation to him had not been given lightly. It was a deliberate\r\nrecognition of the claim that Labour had upon the thought, energy, and\r\nprayer of the Free Churches. Then, turning to Crooks, he clasped his\r\nhand. \"Thus,\" said the President, \"Labour and the Free Churches are\r\njoined in their endeavour to solve some of the great human problems.\"\r\n\r\n\"The world,\" said Crooks in his opening remarks, \"could be divided into\r\ntwo classes--some willing to work and the rest willing to let them.\" He\r\nwent on to ask the representatives of the churches to put it out of\r\ntheir heads that the workman who did not go to a place of worship was a\r\nman utterly without religion. Such a man often had greater faith and\r\nmore works to his credit than many regular worshippers.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards the Free Church Council asked him to the banquet\r\ngiven at the Hotel Cecil in celebration of the return of nearly two\r\nhundred Free Churchmen to the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n\"You Free Churchmen,\" he said in his after-dinner speech, \"have to come\r\nout of yourselves a great deal more in the future than you have in\r\nby-gone days. You cannot live for Sunday alone. You have to live for all\r\nthe seven days of the week, and we expect you to come out and take a\r\nshare of the work of social reorganisation. You are all of you, or the\r\nmajority of you, a little bit ashamed of South Africa, and some of you\r\nwish you had got your tongues loose two or three years ago instead of\r\nnow. You can imagine how I feel about this. A few of us at that time had\r\nto take our lives in our hands because we dared to say that that was a\r\nwicked war. Remember, the Empire does not consist in yelling about the\r\nUnion Jack; the Empire begins in the workman's kitchen....\r\n\r\n\"I have been told plenty of times that our men and women are not\r\nGod-fearing. Aren't they? I know the stories they tell you parsons\r\nsometimes; but down at the bottom of their hearts is a deep religious\r\nfeeling which some of us would be better for having. Why can I always\r\nget the truth from the poor, who so often deceive you parsons? Why,\r\nbecause they feel I am a brother, and they have a doubt about you. You\r\nhave got to wear that doubt off. You have got to make the humblest of\r\nour brothers and sisters understand that you do really care for them,\r\nthat you intend to use the Parliamentary machine to abolish sweating\r\nand slumdom. We have got to promote industry in such a way that every\r\nhonest worker may find useful work to do. We have to deal with the\r\nshirker whether he wears a top hat or hobnail boots.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nCOLONISING ENGLAND\r\n\r\n     Signs of Progress--a Crown Farm Cut Up into Small Holdings--The\r\n     Colony Experiment at Laindon--How it was Killed by the Local\r\n     Government Board--The Hollesley Bay Farm--A Minister for Labour\r\n     Wanted.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter nearly twenty years of hard public service, Crooks saw some of the\r\nthings for which he had striven so strenuously adopted as part of the\r\npolicy of two successive Governments.\r\n\r\nWoolwich re-elected him at the General Election with over nine thousand\r\nvotes, some three or four hundred more than it gave him at the famous\r\nby-election three years before. He saw the new Government back up the\r\nUnemployed Act. He saw the Poor Law Commission at work. He saw the\r\nappointment of another Commission to consider the question of coast\r\nerosion and the reclamation of foreshores, which makes him believe there\r\nis still a chance for the scheme he laid before the Board of Trade in\r\n1893.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, he believes he has done something practical in Parliament for\r\nthe unemployed in another direction. He discovered that of the 70,000\r\nacres of agricultural Crown lands, about 5,000 had been lying idle for\r\nmany years. Thereupon he promptly reminded Sir Henry\r\nCampbell-Bannerman's Government, in the early days of its first\r\nSession, that at the General Election they had talked about the need for\r\ncolonising England. Here, he told the House, was a chance to give effect\r\nto the promise. Cut up the idle land into small holdings, and it would\r\nlet at once. Make better use of the other land by dividing it into\r\nsmaller farms. Further, why not try a scheme of afforestation on some\r\nportion of these Crown lands, which, after all, were the lands of the\r\npeople?\r\n\r\nHe exacted a promise from the Government that the question of giving the\r\nBoard of Agriculture some control of Crown lands, instead of leaving\r\nthem in the hands of the Department of Woods and Forests, would be\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nSomething was done sooner than he expected. The President of the Local\r\nGovernment Board (Mr. John Burns) informed the House that a scheme of\r\nafforestation would be started on Crown lands the succeeding year.\r\nMoreover, Lord Carrington, whose encouragement of small holdings on his\r\nown estates Crooks had commended in the Commons, was added to the\r\nCommission of Woods and Forests in his capacity as President of the\r\nBoard of Agriculture. A start was immediately made by cutting up into\r\nsmall parcels a Crown farm of 916 acres at Burwell in Cambridgeshire.\r\n\r\nThis quiet little reform Crooks hails as affording further means of\r\nsolving the problem of unemployment.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever may be said to the contrary,\" is his way of putting it, \"I\r\nmaintain that even the town wastrel takes more kindly to the land than\r\nto anything else. Of course, I know that before he can be made of any\r\nuse on the land he must be trained; but then it is well known that I\r\nfavour farm colonies for training him.\"\r\n\r\nSince he entered Parliament he had seen farm colonies for the unemployed\r\nbecome realities. His own Board of Guardians was the pioneer of the\r\nmodern farm colony in this country. For nearly a dozen years the\r\nGuardians pleaded with the Local Government Board to be allowed to take\r\na farm. Consent was at last obtained in 1903, when the Guardians had an\r\noffer of 100 acres at Laindon, in Essex, rent free for three years. The\r\noffer was made by Mr. Joseph Fels, a London manufacturer, who had been\r\nfavourably impressed by a system he had seen in Philadelphia, whereby\r\nunemployed men were put to cultivate vacant land.\r\n\r\nAt first the Guardians' experiment was confined to able-bodied men from\r\nthe workhouse. Its scope was widened with the coming of winter. The\r\nPoplar Unemployed Committee, which had the Mayor at its head and Crooks\r\nand Lansbury among its members, agreed on the suggestion of these latter\r\nto send a number of out-of-work men to this farm, meeting the expenses\r\nby a public appeal.\r\n\r\nThe need for giving out-of-work men proper training on the land was\r\nbeing urged at the same time by Mr. John Burns. That winter, as chairman\r\nof the Unemployed Conference called by the London County Council, Mr.\r\nBurns and Canon Escreet, the vice-chairman, signed a report urging that\r\nevery opportunity should be taken to provide such training on the land\r\nas would fit the workers for efficient labour. The report went on:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Efforts in this direction are already made in the case of emigrants\r\n     to the Colonies, but it does not seem altogether reasonable that\r\n     special efforts should be made which would have the effect of\r\n     providing the colonies with specially trained labour if no efforts\r\n     in this direction are made on behalf of the Home Country. It is not\r\n     suggested that training for colonial life should not be provided,\r\n     but merely that the needs of the United Kingdom should be equally\r\n     borne in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I've seen wastrels,\" says Crooks, \"who were going from bad to worse in\r\nour back streets in Poplar regain health and strength when sent to our\r\nfarm at Laindon, and as they felt their muscles strengthening turn to\r\nwork like men. I have seen many a decent unemployed man tided over hard\r\ntimes by being sent to work on our farm. The result of our first\r\nwinter's experiment was that twenty-five of the men emigrated to Canada,\r\nthe better for the training we had given them on the land. A dozen\r\nobtained work on their own account. And then, as the winter passed and\r\ntrade got better, we began to discharge the men gradually. Over one\r\nhundred of the discharged men have never asked for relief from the\r\nGuardians since. If we had taken them into the workhouse at the time of\r\ntheir destitution, as the Poor Law prescribes, the greater part of them\r\nwould have become permanent charges on the rates for the rest of their\r\nlives.\"\r\n\r\nThis promising experiment was killed by the Local Government Board. The\r\nLocal Government Board refused to allow the farm to be continued except\r\nas a branch workhouse. Mr. Fels, at the end of the three years' trial,\r\nwrote to the Guardians:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     I desire to emphasise that my offer of the farm in the first\r\n     instance was not for the purpose of establishing a branch\r\n     workhouse, and in that way perpetuating stone yards, oakum picking,\r\n     and corn grinding, and other useless tasks, which seems to be all\r\n     the Local Government Board want to do.\r\n\r\n     On the contrary, I hoped that your Board would be allowed to try to\r\n     re-establish men who were down on their luck. I never for one\r\n     moment dreamed that your Board would be forced by the Local\r\n     Government Board to keep 150 men on one hundred acres of land, it\r\n     being obvious to me then, as now, that neither men nor staff could\r\n     have a chance in such conditions. Although the Local Government\r\n     Board has stifled this experiment, I am convinced that some such\r\n     Poor Law reform is bound to come.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Poplar experiment certainly satisfied Mr. Long when he was at the\r\nLocal Government Board. He expressly stated, when suggesting the\r\nformation of his Central Unemployed Committee, that farm colonies\r\nrepresented one means by which the Committee could assist men out of\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nOne of the first things the Committee did was to take the Hollesley Bay\r\nFarm, where both Crooks and Lansbury as active members of the Committee\r\nhelped to develop the work. Mr. Fels again assisted, this time building\r\na number of cottages with a view to drafting off some of the colonists\r\ninto a position of independence, joined by their wives and families\r\nfrom London. The hope is entertained that some proportion of them may\r\nbecome small holders. Hollesley Bay Farm, which had been an agricultural\r\ntraining college for the sons of rich men going to the colonies, thus\r\nbecame a centre for training poor men to colonise their own country.\r\n\r\nAll these practical schemes for helping the unemployed and saving the\r\ncities from recurring periods of distress, which Crooks had done so much\r\nto set going, lend colour to his claim that the time has come for the\r\naddition to all future Cabinets of a new member to be styled the\r\nMinister for Labour. For nearly twenty years we have seen this labouring\r\nman, content with his three or four pounds a week, in a working-man's\r\nhouse in a working-man's neighbourhood, devising and carrying out social\r\nmeasures for the well-being of the nation that ought rightly to have\r\ncome from the Government.\r\n\r\n\"The first thing a Labour Minister would do,\" he says, \"would be to take\r\nover the Labour Department and other more or less allied departments of\r\nthe Board of Trade. The present Labour returns of the Board of Trade are\r\nno good to anybody. I would have the Labour Minister obtain from all the\r\nlocal authorities a statement of what they regard as useful public works\r\nfor their own districts. As soon as a spell of bad trade set in in any\r\nparticular district our Minister of Industry would turn up the\r\nsuggestions that had reached him from the affected quarter and make a\r\nnational grant towards starting the local works.\r\n\r\n\"Then again I should leave to his Department rather than to the Local\r\nGovernment Board the duty of controlling farm colonies. I want to see\r\nthe Government responsible for three separate kinds of labour colonies.\r\nFirst I want a farm colony for the habitual able-bodied pauper. He needs\r\nto have his muscles hardened and to be trained to work. The tasks set\r\nsuch a man in the workhouse are wasteful, and do him no good. You might\r\nhave a combination of Poor Law Unions interested in such a colony. The\r\nsecond class of farm colony would be for habitual tramps. These men need\r\nto be kept entirely separate from able-bodied paupers. The third class\r\nwould be voluntary colonies, to which unemployed men could be sent and\r\ntrained in market gardening and farming.\r\n\r\n\"In fact, the practical work a Minister of Labour could do is endless.\r\nHe could settle differences between masters and men before a strike was\r\nthought of. To him could be referred disputes as to machinery, questions\r\nas to safeguards, matters affecting hours, meal-times, overtime, and\r\nwomen's work. He would be the most useful Minister in the Cabinet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nTHE REVIVAL OF BUMBLEDOM\r\n\r\n     Crooks's Poor Law Policy Attacked--How a Local Government Board\r\n     Inquiry was Conducted--Crooks's Mistake in Remaining Chairman of\r\n     the Board of Guardians--The Inspector's Report--Why the Poor Die\r\n     rather than go to Poplar Workhouse.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand that the humane spirit Crooks had infused into\r\nPoor Law administration, and the fact of his having made the State\r\nrecognise a duty to the unemployed, was not acceptable to the old order\r\nof Poor Law administrators, nor to some of the officials of the Local\r\nGovernment Board.\r\n\r\nWhen Crooks entered upon Poor Law work he found it bound hand and foot\r\nby red tape. The men elected by the people did not rule at all. They\r\nwere little more than the servants of paid officials, whether in the\r\nperson of Bumble in the workhouse or of Bumble at the Local Government\r\nBoard.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how he fought against Bumble administration, and how\r\nsuccessive Presidents of the Local Government Board lent him their\r\nsupport. Mr. Ritchie, at the request of Poplar, reduced the\r\nqualification for Guardians. Sir Henry Fowler abolished it, and, again\r\nat Poplar's request, deprived workhouse masters of the power to refuse\r\nadmission to Guardians. Mr. Henry Chaplin ordered \"workhouse comforts\"\r\nand \"adequate out-relief.\" Mr. Walter Long improved the dietary scale\r\nand formed the Central Unemployed Committee. Mr. Gerald Balfour passed\r\nthe Unemployed Act.\r\n\r\nAll these reforms were more or less unwelcome to Bumbledom. One can\r\nunderstand how impatiently those who stood for the old harsh order of\r\nthings waited for an opportunity to break into revolt. Their opportunity\r\ncame in June, 1906, at the Local Government Board Inquiry into Poplar's\r\nPoor Law administration.\r\n\r\nCrooks, who was still Chairman, courted the fullest and most open\r\ninvestigation. Directly he heard that the Poplar Municipal Alliance was\r\nmaking charges against the Guardians to the Local Government Board, he\r\nappealed for a public Inquiry.\r\n\r\nOn the opening day of the public Inquiry at Poplar Crooks and his\r\ncolleague George Lansbury felt it to be their duty to protest against\r\nits being conducted by an Inspector who, they alleged, had his verdict\r\nin his pocket. They wished to make no reflection upon the Inspector's\r\npersonal integrity, but they declared then and afterwards that it\r\nappeared to them to be \"quite unjust to appoint so extreme an opponent\r\nof their policy to conduct the inquiry.\"\r\n\r\nFor fifteen out of the twenty days that the inquiry lasted the Inspector\r\nallowed the Municipal Alliance practically to direct the proceedings.\r\nThey did their best to discredit Crooks's Poor Law policy on account of\r\nthe malpractices of some of his colleagues, of which, up to then, owing\r\nto the pressure of his other public duties, he had been ignorant.\r\n\r\nThe Inspector, whose knowledge might have taught him how far from true\r\nmany of the innuendoes were, made no attempt to stop them. He appeared\r\nto think it quite right to allow statements to go forth to the public\r\nthat paupers were being fed on all kinds of delicacies, and that\r\nserviettes, pocket handkerchiefs, and outfits for girls going to service\r\nwere for the use of the ordinary inmates of the workhouse.\r\n\r\nThe public did not know at the time that the \"Linen Collars for\r\nWorkhouse Inmates,\" blazoned forth in the Press as an example of\r\nPoplar's extravagance, were simply what were supplied to the boys in the\r\nschool, that they too, like the girls, might go out into the world no\r\nlonger branded, but self-respecting.\r\n\r\nAll through the Inquiry the public was given to understand that Poplar\r\nwas an example of what happens under Labour administration. Since the\r\ntwo most prominent Guardians, Crooks and Lansbury, were known everywhere\r\nas Labour leaders, the whole Board was wrongly supposed to consist of\r\ntheir followers. In reality, out of a Board of twenty-four members only\r\nten were Labour representatives, and not half of these Socialists. The\r\nmajority of the Guardians were Conservatives and Liberals.\r\n\r\nThe policy of Crooks and Lansbury did to a large extent dominate the\r\nBoard, due no doubt to their ability and personal magnetism. But\r\nbetween the _policy_ of these two men and the _administration_ of\r\ncertain of their colleagues lay a gulf that neither the Inspector nor\r\nthe Press seemed to see at the time. These two were held responsible for\r\ncertain faults of administration committed by individual members of the\r\nBoard belonging to the Liberal and Conservative parties. They were\r\nactually held up to reproach and ridicule for faults and follies\r\ncommitted by colleagues who had bitterly opposed their policy at every\r\nstep.\r\n\r\nThe Inquiry taught Crooks his mistake in consenting to remain Chairman\r\nof the Board after his election to Parliament. We have seen that his\r\nconsent to remain was given reluctantly, and on the understanding that\r\nhe should devote less time to the work. He little thought that some of\r\nthose who pressed him to stay would take advantage of his relaxed\r\nattention to bring discredit on the Board's administration. He therefore\r\nseized an early opportunity in the succeeding year of resigning the\r\noffice, informing the Board by word of mouth, and the people of Poplar\r\nby circular letter, that in doing so, owing to the press of other public\r\nduties, he did not propose to abandon in the smallest way any part of\r\nthat policy of Poor Law reform to which the best years of his public\r\nlife had been devoted. He also publicly declared in Poplar repeatedly\r\nthat he would do his best to expose and turn out of public life any\r\nperson guilty of corruption, and even while the Inquiry was going on he\r\nappealed to the Inspector more than once to order a prosecution of\r\nsuspected Guardians and contractors.\r\n\r\nAfter the dust and din caused by the Municipal Alliance had died down,\r\nthat body found itself largely discredited in Poplar. One of its members\r\nwrote to the Press:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Over this Inquiry we have already made many enemies.... It would be\r\n     difficult to define what the Alliance set out to do, but the\r\n     methods employed in doing it were, to say the least, unworthy....\r\n\r\n     I did not think, when we embarked on this expensive trip, that we\r\n     were going to attempt to cover with ridicule men who, it must be\r\n     admitted, have devoted a considerable portion of their time to the\r\n     affairs of the Union, and are now proved to have been thoroughly\r\n     honest in their policy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Alliance was to receive a heavier blow from the Poplar people. To\r\nthem an insult to Crooks was an insult to Poplar. The Borough Council\r\nElections followed soon after the Inquiry, the Alliance throwing all its\r\nweight into the local campaign. In nearly all the other London boroughs\r\nthe Progressives and Labour men were badly beaten. In Poplar the Labour\r\nParty went back larger in numbers and backed by a stronger vote of the\r\nelectors than they had ever had before. Lansbury defeated the Chairman\r\nof the Alliance.\r\n\r\n\"That,\" said Crooks at the time, in an interview in one of the daily\r\npapers, \"is the answer of the people of Poplar to the slanders and\r\nmisrepresentations levelled against me. The people of Poplar know the\r\ntruth about my policy, whatever may have been the shortcomings of some\r\nof my colleagues; the people of London do not know--they only have the\r\nYellow Press version.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, when a few weeks later the triennial election for the London\r\nCounty Council took place, the people of Poplar stood by their Labour\r\nmember. Progressive and Labour seats fell all over London in March,\r\n1907, but Crooks was re-elected for Poplar at the top of the poll with\r\n3,504 votes, though the Alliance strained every nerve to oust him.\r\n\r\nThen it was that his outside accusers began to suspect they had been\r\nmisled. Here was a prophet in his own country indeed--accused and\r\nslandered outside, but trusted and honoured by his neighbours. And when\r\na month later the election of Guardians took place, and Poplar, put to a\r\nthird test, declared more emphatically than ever for the Crooks policy\r\nby defeating about two-thirds of the Alliance candidates and electing an\r\nincreased number of Labour men, the eyes of the public were opened.\r\n\r\nBut the revival of Bumbledom was not yet at an end. The Local Government\r\nBoard Inspector's report came out three and a half months after the\r\ninquiry closed. The unusual course was followed of publishing it before\r\nthe evidence. When the evidence did appear it disproved many of the\r\nInspector's conclusions.\r\n\r\nThe Inspector was bound to say there was no reflection upon the\r\n\"personal integrity of Mr. Crooks and Mr. Lansbury.\"\r\n\r\nWhile deprecating the standard of comfort in the workhouse, the\r\nInspector made no reference to the doctor's statement that he did not\r\nthink the inmates were too well fed or clad. Rather, he tried to\r\nundermine Crooks's policy by remarks of this kind:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Mr. Crooks in his evidence admitted that the dietary in the\r\n     workhouse was better than could be obtained by the independent\r\n     labourer in the borough with a wife and two children to keep who\r\n     received anything under 30s. a week.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evidence gives a different version. What Crooks said (page 389)\r\nwas:--\r\n\r\n\"A man with 30s. a week with a wife and two children can only just keep\r\nhimself in decency. When he gets below that he gets below the Local\r\nGovernment Board diet.... The men in the workhouse get a bare\r\nsubsistence, and no man outside ought to be paid wages less than enable\r\nhim to get that kind of living. What you have to prove is that we are\r\ngiving the people in the workhouse such luxury as a man in ordinary work\r\nat from thirty to forty shillings a week could not get at home. But what\r\nhe\" [the legal representative of the Municipal Alliance] \"does not say\r\nis that we are dealing with the very aged in the workhouse--the\r\nable-bodied, as you know, are exceedingly limited in number--but he does\r\nnot appreciate for a moment that after all a man's liberty is worth\r\nsomething. Liberty has not fallen in value. It is a priceless something.\r\nA man will die for it. And our people will die--a good many of\r\nthem--rather than go into the workhouse.\"\r\n\r\nIt happened that the people of Poplar were dying for it about that very\r\ntime. While the Local Government Board was harassing Crooks for his\r\nefforts to save the poor from starvation, another Department of the\r\nState was in correspondence with the Guardians over two cases of people\r\nwho had died from starvation in Poplar. This was the Home Office.\r\n\r\nIt is a theory of the British Constitution that no person in the kingdom\r\nshould die of starvation. Yet in London alone forty-eight people died of\r\nstarvation in the winter of 1905-6. Whitechapel, which gives no\r\nout-relief, and is held up as a model by the Inspector who conducted the\r\nPoplar inquiry, had ten deaths from starvation within its borders during\r\nthe year. Poplar, where the Guardians are said to be too generous in\r\ntheir treatment of the poor, was unable, with all its zeal, to prevent\r\ntwo people dying from want of food.\r\n\r\nOne of the victims was a child whose father refused to go into Poplar\r\nworkhouse--this so-called \"palace of luxury\"--because he thought he\r\nmight still be able to earn a trifle outside. Out-relief in the way of\r\nfood was given to the value of 3s. 6d. a week, but that not being enough\r\nfor a family of five, the youngest defied the British Constitution by\r\nquietly slipping into the grave--\"Died of asthenia and bronchitis,\" was\r\nthe coroner's verdict, \"due to mother's want of food, accelerated by\r\nwant of proper clothing.\"\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards a married labourer in Old Ford, faced with\r\nstarvation, refused to apply to the Poplar Guardians because it had\r\nbecome common talk among the poor of the district that the Local\r\nGovernment Board would no longer allow the Guardians to assist people\r\noutside the workhouse. And one morning this unemployed man had to run to\r\nthe nearest doctor's because one of his children was \"took queer.\" What\r\nfollowed was told by the doctor in evidence a few days later at the\r\nPoplar Coroner's Court. He related how he was knocked up in the early\r\nmorning, and how, when he went to the house, he found no sign of food,\r\nno fire, and, lying on some scanty bedding, a girl-child, who had been\r\ndead about an hour. Death, he added, was due to exhaustion from want of\r\nsufficient food. He was so shocked with the poverty of the home that he\r\ngave the parents five shillings out of his own pocket, and sent them\r\nsomething to eat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nAPPEAL TO THE PEOPLE\r\n\r\n     Crooks Appeals to the Public--\"This Insult to the Poor\"--Resentment\r\n     all over the Country--A Voice from the Hungry 'Forties--Cheering\r\n     Letters--A Government Department's Blunder--Poplar's Appeal to\r\n     Crooks.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day after the report of the Local Government Board Inspector was\r\npublished, Crooks sent his decision upon it to the Press. He wrote from\r\nthe House of Commons, where, as he stated in his letter, \"the unfairness\r\nand injustice of the report in its bearings on my Poor Law policy are so\r\nfar recognised that to-day I have been told by members of all parties\r\nthat the report is not only wicked but brutal.\" He further stated in his\r\nletter to the Press:--\r\n\r\n\"Will you permit me to make it public through your columns that I accept\r\nthe challenge thrown down in the Local Government Board report? Against\r\nall its strictures I intend to maintain my stand on that policy of\r\nhumanising the Poor Law, to which I have given the greater part of my\r\nlife. And in doing so I propose to appeal from the Local Government\r\nBoard to the public.\r\n\r\n\"If the public upholds this insult to the poor I shall be painfully\r\nsurprised. After twenty days of a searching inquiry, and after twice\r\ntwenty pages of a strained attack on Mr. Lansbury and myself, there is\r\nnothing to show that we have done anything against the actual orders and\r\nregulations of the very Board that now rises in mock-heroic wrath to\r\nslay us. Our only crime is that we have humanised a system framed in\r\n1834, when the voteless working classes were dragooned by a middle-class\r\nmajority....\r\n\r\n\"My present duty is clear. The public may remember that at Mr. Chaplin's\r\nrequest I went as a nominee of the Local Government Board on the\r\nMetropolitan Asylums Board. It may remember that I was co-opted on the\r\nCentral Unemployed Body on the suggestion of Mr. Walter Long. Now that\r\nthe Local Government Board, under the new Government, has seen fit to\r\nattack me and my Labour colleagues, and to flout the poor as I venture\r\nto say they have never been flouted by that Department before, I can no\r\nlonger hold those two positions. I propose to resign. Nor until its\r\nattitude towards the poor and the unemployed changes will I ever consent\r\nto represent the Local Government Board on any public body again. I\r\nprefer to represent the people....\r\n\r\n\"The faults of administration at Poplar, so grossly magnified in this\r\nreport, are common to all such bodies, and Poplar will do its best to\r\navoid them. But the policy will not change. By that we stand or fall.\"\r\n\r\nThe reason for that policy was briefly explained in a special report\r\nissued by the Poplar Guardians and signed by Crooks as Chairman. It\r\nformed part of the Board's reply to the Inspector's report. Thus:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     This policy was never put in force with the idea that it would lead\r\n     to a reduction in rates or in the number applying for relief. No\r\n     one imagines that decent treatment of the poor will choke off\r\n     applicants in the manner that harsh treatment will, but we claim\r\n     that under the Act of Elizabeth, the poor (not merely the\r\n     destitute, but the poor) are entitled to come to society in time of\r\n     need.\r\n\r\n     The State provides all kinds of services for the community, such as\r\n     roads, sewers, light, police, army, navy, education, etc., and we\r\n     all enjoy those privileges. The State pensions its well-paid\r\n     Cabinet Ministers and officials; and we claim that the poor, whose\r\n     charter is the 43rd of Elizabeth, instead of being penalised when\r\n     needing help, should receive such help in an ungrudging measure and\r\n     in a manner which would most effectively preserve their\r\n     self-respect.\r\n\r\n     Finally, we would again repeat that our pauperism is due to our\r\n     poverty, that our policy is based on the claims recognised by\r\n     statute as the due right of the poor. We neither palliate nor\r\n     excuse any lapses either on the part of members or officers of the\r\n     Board, but we claim that as a Board we have carried out our duties\r\n     as efficiently and as economically as we were able, that we have\r\n     never given indiscriminate relief either in or out of the\r\n     workhouse, and in the main have usefully tried to do our duty both\r\n     to the poor, who have our first claim, and to the ratepayers.\r\n\r\n     We have never ceased to urge for the past ten years that the poor\r\n     are a metropolitan charge, that unemployment is a national\r\n     question, that the Poor Law should be reformed. We are glad to know\r\n     that our work, despite this present attack, has been successful,\r\n     and that the poor of Poplar are better cared for, and not only the\r\n     poor of Poplar, but the poor of the United Kingdom generally, as a\r\n     result of our effort.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis appeal to the public won an inspiring response. Bumbledom was\r\nagainst him, but the people were with him. While a section of the Press\r\nwas attacking him, it was so far ignorant of what the people of England\r\nwere thinking as to know nothing at all of the tremendous meetings he\r\nwas addressing all over the country.\r\n\r\nHis meetings in Poplar and Woolwich, where he was supported with rousing\r\nenthusiasm, were the largest he had ever had in those boroughs. At\r\nChesterfield he addressed an open-air meeting of nearly twenty thousand\r\nMidland miners, when his reference to his Poor Law policy was cheered to\r\nthe echo. The Cleveland miners were equally enthusiastic when he went up\r\nto their annual gathering. It was the same at public meetings in\r\nNewcastle, Burton, Huddersfield, Rossendale, Stockport, Batley,\r\nSunderland, Penarth--the man who had stood out against one of\r\nBumbledom's fiercest onslaughts had the good-will and confidence of the\r\nworking people of England. At his indoor meetings there were rarely\r\nfewer than two thousand people present. Often he had audiences of four\r\nand five thousand.\r\n\r\nIt looked as though a recurrence of his old illness would prevent him\r\nfrom keeping an appointment to speak on his Poor Law policy at Bradford.\r\nSuch was the strength of the appeal sent to him, however, that he\r\ndetermined to risk it. He had to be helped by his wife on the journey,\r\nand when at the meeting it was found he was unable to stand there was a\r\nunanimous call that he be allowed to keep his chair while speaking.\r\nSeated in the middle of the platform, he held an audience of two or\r\nthree thousand people for upwards of an hour. The response he wrung from\r\nthe crowded hall moved him deeply. Bumbledom never had a worse hour.\r\n\r\nOf course his first public meeting after the publication of the Local\r\nGovernment Board's report took place at the Dock Gates in Poplar.\r\n\r\n\"We never had a better meeting,\" he wrote to me the next day. \"The\r\naudience backed me to a man and woman--and, by the way, we never had so\r\nmany women present before. It did me good.\"\r\n\r\nAt some of his provincial meetings there were people who well-nigh\r\nworshipped him. Old men in particular who had known the Hungry 'Forties\r\nwould come up to him after the meeting and say:--\r\n\r\n\"Let me shake you by the hand, Mr. Crooks. We read about it in the\r\npapers, but the papers don't understand. We've been through it, and\r\nknow. Don't be down-hearted, Mr. Crooks. God bless you!\"\r\n\r\nAt a small country town a bed had been reserved for him at the little\r\nhotel outside the railway station. He arrived about midnight, and found\r\nthe place in darkness. He knocked loudly for some time. At last a man's\r\nvoice was heard from the railway line.\r\n\r\n\"Is that Mr. Crooks? Lord love yer, we knew you'd be late, and gone\r\nagain early in the morning, and so that I shouldn't miss seeing you I\r\ntold the hotel-keeper to go to bed and let me have the keys, so that\r\nyou couldn't get in without me shaking you by the hand.\"\r\n\r\nHis first public meeting in Woolwich after the Local Government Board\r\nInquiry drew an audience of over five thousand people to the Drill Hall.\r\nHis colleague Lansbury shared in the inspiring reception and addressed\r\nthe meeting.\r\n\r\nCrooks told the audience it was no wonder that Lansbury and he got angry\r\nat times over our iniquitous Poor Law system. Such was the injustice of\r\nthe rating system in London that Poplar--which was spending out of the\r\nrates per head of population less than half what West-End districts like\r\nKensington and Marylebone were spending--appeared to outsiders to be\r\nextravagant. If those West-End Boroughs had Poplar's poor to look after,\r\ntheir rates, instead of being about 7s., would be about 15s. in the\r\npound. The poor of Poplar were London's poor; yet the cost of looking\r\nafter them was borne mainly by the people of Poplar. London was the only\r\ncity in the world where those who grew rich on the labour of the poor\r\nwere able to segregate themselves in favoured quarters, and escape their\r\nobligation to help the aged poor unable to work longer.\r\n\r\nHe went on to show the iniquities of our Poor Law system from a national\r\nstandpoint. About £28,000,000 a year was raised in the name of the Poor\r\nLaw. Of this only £14,000,000 had any connection with the Poor Law at\r\nall. And how were the fourteen millions spent? The poor got seven and a\r\nhalf millions, while the remaining six and a half millions were spent\r\nin administrative charges. That meant that every 5s. given to the poor\r\nout of the rates cost the ratepayers another 4s. 9d. to give it. No\r\nwonder that Bumbledom became nervous when Guardians urged that the poor\r\nrather than officials should receive more of this money raised for the\r\npoor. The Local Government Board Inspector, when deploring that Poplar's\r\nexpenditure on the poor had gone up during the last ten years, might\r\nhave added that during the same period the cost of collecting rates in\r\nthe City had gone up from £11,000 to £23,000. It seemed to be all right\r\nwhen officials got the money, but all wrong when the poor got it.\r\n\r\n\"I believe in being a true Guardian of the poor, and not merely a\r\nGuardian of the Poor Rate. We in Poplar have preferred to save the lives\r\nof the poor rather than the rates. Even then we have administered with\r\nremarkable economy; for Poplar's rates would not be high if London as a\r\nwhole paid its proper share towards maintaining London's poor. We in\r\nPoplar, however, have not allowed an unjust rating system to prevent us\r\nfrom doing our duty to broken-down old people, to the starving and to\r\nthe unemployed. We agree with Carlyle that 'to believe practically, that\r\nthe poor and luckless are here only as a nuisance to be abraded and\r\nabated, and in some permissible manner made away with, and swept out of\r\nsight, is not an amiable faith. To say to the poor: Ye shall eat the\r\nbread of affliction and drink the water of affliction and be very\r\nmiserable while here, requires not so much a stretch of heroic faculty\r\nin any sense as due toughness of bowels.'\"\r\n\r\nFrom Stockport, where he had been addressing one of a series of public\r\nmeetings in the Midlands, he wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"How good the people are! Whenever I mention Poplar, it is truly\r\ninspiring to hear the magnificent response. Last night the moment the\r\nword passed my lips an audience of two thousand cheered like one man. It\r\nsometimes overwhelms me almost. Who am I to deserve it?...\r\n\r\n\"I am sometimes told that I affect to despise my critics. You know\r\nbetter, of course. But, really, after such experiences as these, I can't\r\nhelp laughing at them when I think of their ponderous official\r\npronouncements against my policy and of the equally ponderous lectures\r\nread to me by certain sections of the Press and the Church. When will\r\nthe Press and the Church, and 'all who are put in authority over us,'\r\ncome to learn what the mind of the people really is, and begin to\r\ninterpret it rightly? I know the heart of the people to be true. That is\r\nwhy I laugh and go on my way confident that the little piece of\r\nwell-doing I have aimed at on behalf of the poor and the unemployed will\r\nin the end put to 'silence the ignorance of foolish men.'\"\r\n\r\nIf his meetings were inspiring, the same can be said of his\r\ncorrespondence. Public men, in various parts of the country, including\r\nGuardians, wrote to congratulate him on the brave stand he had made\r\nagainst the forces of Bumbledom. From other quarters he had many\r\nencouraging letters.\r\n\r\nCanon Scott Holland wrote: \"You know how your friends feel for you in\r\nthis cruel trouble. We need not tell you how we trust you, and believe\r\nin you, and stand by you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have made many lives happier and better by your work on behalf of\r\nthe poor,\" wrote a high official from a central Poor Law establishment.\r\n\"I thought it might be a comfort to you to know we feel indignant that\r\nyou have been rudely assailed.\"\r\n\r\nIt was encouraging also to receive a note from a prominent Woolwich\r\nConservative. The writer commenced by saying that although he was a\r\npolitical opponent, and would continue to be so, he had the greatest\r\nrespect for Crooks personally, and wished to assure him that he did not\r\nagree with the attacks that had been made on his Poor Law policy.\r\n\r\n\"Cheer up,\" came a message from the Rev. A. Tildsley, pastor of the\r\nPoplar and Bromley Tabernacle. \"Don't get off your high pedestal to go\r\ndown to your opponents' level. Leave the mud alone. The sun shines\r\ndaily, and will soon dry it. Then it will drop off itself. All good men\r\nhave to pay the price. This is not your first baptism of fire in defence\r\nof the poor.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the Oxford House Settlement, Bethnal Green, the Rev. H. S.\r\nWoolcombe wrote:--\"I am perfectly certain that this attack cannot do you\r\nany permanent harm, and that you and Lansbury are both men too big to\r\nlet it abate your courage and determination to go on with your work.\"\r\n\r\nLetters came to him from abroad long after the Inquiry. Unknown friends\r\nin America, France, and other countries sent him sympathetic letters. He\r\ntold one of his Woolwich meetings--according to the report in the Labour\r\nParty's weekly newspaper, the _Woolwich Pioneer_:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     He had had a few letters that were not sympathetic (Laughter, and a\r\n     voice, \"Rub it in for Robb\"). Well, he had rubbed it in as well as\r\n     he could. Mr. Robb [the legal representative of the Alliance at the\r\n     Inquiry] was not a bad chap at all. A man must earn his money, and\r\n     Mr. Robb had earned his very well. He (Mr. Crooks) had not a word\r\n     to say against anybody. Some mud had been thrown, but it would\r\n     easily brush off. After all, there still remained the obligation to\r\n     look after those who were unable to look after themselves, and to\r\n     give to the poor and little children left to their care and mercy\r\n     the best of their ability and service. They were proud that God had\r\n     given them the opportunity to do the work they had done. And they\r\n     were not ashamed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that when the Local Government Board was investigating\r\nthe Guardians' contracts something was brought to light which even the\r\nInspector records to the credit of Poplar. He found that some years\r\npreviously the Guardians, recognising that the system of dealing with\r\ncontracts by Poor Law authorities was a faulty one, liable to abuse, had\r\nappealed to the Local Government Board to establish a central authority\r\nfor dealing with all Poor Law contracts in London, thus removing from\r\nthe local Guardians the temptation towards favouritism and loose\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nThat appeal was disregarded, though it is understood the Local\r\nGovernment Board will shortly be compelled to carry out Poplar's\r\nsuggestion, because of the demoralisation which the loose system has\r\ncreated. Had the appeal been heeded at the time--originated as it was by\r\nthe Labour Members at Poplar--much of the corruption brought to light in\r\nseveral Poor Law Unions in respect to contracts could never have taken\r\nplace. The Local Government Board's own loose system, therefore, has\r\nbeen indirectly responsible for corruption on Poor Law bodies.\r\n\r\nThis fact doubtless influenced Canon Barnett to pass very severe\r\nstrictures on the Local Government Board's gross neglect of duty. \"The\r\ninspectors of the Local Government Board,\" he stated in the _Daily\r\nNews_, \"hold inquiries into scandals for which they are themselves\r\nlargely responsible. Why did they not discover and report these matters\r\nyears ago? We ought to have independent inquiries, in which the\r\ninspectors are subjected to examination, for it is their perfunctory\r\ninspection which has allowed the growth of such evil.\"\r\n\r\nDefeated over the Inquiry the Local Government Board carried out a\r\nminute analysis of the Guardians' accounts. The ordinary Local\r\nGovernment Board audit occupies only three days. In the case of Poplar,\r\nit was on this occasion extended over three months. Every item was\r\ncarefully examined in accounts representing an expenditure of over a\r\nquarter of a million sterling. On the whole of this sum, the auditor,\r\nafter his three months' investigation, only found half a dozen trifling\r\nitems that he could question. These represented a few shillings for\r\n\"Guardians' and other persons' teas,\" and about £5 in respect to\r\nexcessive fares under the head of travelling expenses. These items were\r\nsurcharged to the individual Guardians responsible, of whom Crooks,\r\nneedless to say, was not one. Indeed, he as Chairman assisted the\r\nauditor in bringing to light what he considered the excessive fares\r\nwhich had been charged by some of his colleagues on the Board.\r\n\r\nThe surcharge for the teas revealed Bumbledom at its worst. The \"other\r\npersons' teas\" referred to included the occasional afternoon cup offered\r\nto the ladies of the Brabazon Society on their visiting days. Bumbledom,\r\nwhich connives at Guardians' six-course dinners at five shillings per\r\nhead in other Unions, proved itself to be so far embittered against\r\nPoplar that it actually objected to a cup of tea and a lunch biscuit to\r\nlady visitors belonging to a society which has given thousands of pounds\r\nfrom the private purses of its members for brightening our workhouses.\r\n\r\nIt happened that these ladies were presenting their yearly report on\r\nPoplar Workhouse about the same time the Local Government Board attack\r\ntook place. These good women are not influenced by the Local Government\r\nBoard or by Municipal Alliances or by the party differences among the\r\nGuardians. Their opinion is that of a quiet body of independent,\r\nintelligent women. In their report on Poplar Workhouse they say:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     During the year forty-six meetings have been held, and at each some\r\n     part of the House has been visited. The year has been singularly\r\n     free from complaints, all the inmates seeming happy and contented.\r\n\r\n     The nurses in charge are kindness itself, and are uniformly\r\n     good-tempered and active. The whole House is kept beautifully\r\n     clean, and each ward is a picture of cosiness and comfort.\r\n\r\n     Every useful aid is procured for the infirm, to help them to move\r\n     about easily. The sick are kindly tended, and the little children's\r\n     health and comfort carefully supervised.\r\n\r\n\r\nObserve, in connection with this three months' audit, that not a penny\r\nwas surcharged in respect to the out-relief grants. Notwithstanding all\r\nthe wild charges that had been made, not a single case could be found\r\nwhere Crooks's policy of helping the poor could be proved to be illegal.\r\nAfter all the hubbub, a three months' scrutiny under the eye of a\r\ncapable Government auditor proved that Poplar had simply been carrying\r\nout the law relating to the poor.\r\n\r\nThe Local Government Board was badly beaten in its attempt to discredit\r\nCrooks's policy. Finally, it was argued on the Board's behalf, as though\r\nin a last grasp at a straw, that the decrease in the amount of\r\nout-relief during the year of the Inquiry was in itself a justification\r\nof the Local Government Board's action. Everybody outside the Board\r\nknows differently. The year referred to (1906) was the most prosperous\r\nthis country has ever experienced. If anything, the industries of\r\nPoplar shared in that prosperity to a larger extent than other parts of\r\nthe country. The primary cause of the decrease was not the Inquiry, but\r\nthe lessening of want brought about by an extraordinary trade revival.\r\n\r\n\"Give us,\" Crooks has repeatedly stated in public, \"the same terrible\r\nstate of things that we had in some of the previous winters, and I shall\r\napply the same remedy again. The law is there for the sake of the poor,\r\nnot for the sake of officials. My policy is not a haphazard one. It is\r\nthe outcome of years of experience. It is fundamentally sound, and will\r\none day become a national policy.\"\r\n\r\nCrooks had indeed played a part for the poor of the whole nation. Before\r\nthe echoes of the Bumbledom agitation had died away the very Government\r\nwhich allowed one of its Departments to be made an instrument in that\r\nagitation was promising to carry out the very reforms for which Crooks\r\nhad striven and suffered--Old Age Pensions, Amendment of the Poor Law,\r\nand Equalisation of London Rates.\r\n\r\nThe Government, however, shirked a discussion of the Poplar Report in\r\nthe House of Commons. The Labour Party, backed by Conservative Members,\r\npressed the Prime Minister for an opportunity to discuss the report. Mr.\r\nKeir Hardie and Crooks pointed out that, as the report stood, an\r\ninjustice was done to a popularly elected body, the effect of which\r\nwould be to deter other Boards of Guardians from carrying out the Poor\r\nLaw in a humane spirit. They further maintained that the country was now\r\nwithout guidance as to how to treat poor people out of work and in need\r\nof food.\r\n\r\nBut the Government had learnt by this time that a departmental blunder\r\nhad been committed by associating the Poor Law policy of Crooks with the\r\nfaulty administration of some of his colleagues. The Prime Minister got\r\nout of the difficulty by informing the House that the report was not\r\nmade by the Local Government Board, but to that Board by one of their\r\nofficers, \"and,\" he added, \"I don't understand that it is proposed to\r\ncall in question any action of my right hon. friend the President in\r\nregard to the report.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, the President of the Local Government Board assured a friend of\r\nCrooks in a conversation in the Lobby that there had been a\r\nmisunderstanding somewhere. He sought an early opportunity of giving\r\nCrooks a similar assurance.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was said of Crooks in Poplar about that time that he was going to\r\nleave the neighbourhood never to return. Working-men came round to him\r\nin solemn deputation, and women and children stopped him in the street,\r\nin order to hear from his own lips that the bodeful rumour bore no\r\nmeaning. The rumour, which never had the smallest basis of truth,\r\nreached the workhouse, where he had not been seen for two or three\r\nweeks, weighed down as he was by a hundred public attacks, his own\r\nwearing illness and a heavy domestic trouble. But one afternoon he found\r\ntime to go and see the inmates again. And old men hobbled towards him\r\nand clutched his arm and hand as they broke down in their efforts to\r\ntell him what was in their hearts. When he entered the women's wards\r\nthere was a chorus of almost tearful appeals. \"Say it isn't true, Mr.\r\nCrooks.\" \"Don't go away and leave us, Mr. Crooks.\"\r\n\r\nSitting alone at the end of a bench was one old dame talking to herself\r\nin that vague, mumbling way common to many old women in our workhouses.\r\nAs she rambled on in her talk she took up the cry:--\r\n\r\n\"Don't leave us, Mr. Crooks. For over seventy years I worked hard, Mr.\r\nCrooks, ever since I was eight years of age. Brought up a family of\r\nten--two boys died in the wars, one drowned at sea. All the others left\r\nme long ago, and I don't know where they are. And my man was buried in\r\n'eighty-nine--buried near the brickfields where we worked together\r\nthirty years before. And I kept myself outside for fifteen years, a lone\r\nold woman; and you helped me, Mr. Crooks, until I couldn't look after\r\nmyself any longer, and then you made me comfortable here. So now I count\r\nthe days between your coming to see us to cheer us up. So please don't\r\nleave us, Mr. Crooks. Don't--don't leave us, Mr. Crooks.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\n\"THE HAPPY WARRIOR\"\r\n\r\n     A Cheerful Invalid and his Neighbours--The Starving Children in the\r\n     Schools--Public Confidence in Crooks--Left Smiling.\r\n\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards he was laid low for two or three weeks, the victim of\r\nhis old enemy, muscular rheumatism.\r\n\r\n\"Some of my ancestors must have been aristocrats,\" he used to tell his\r\nvisitors good-naturedly from his sick bed in explanation of his\r\nrecurring complaint.\r\n\r\nAs usual, the knocker at No. 81, Gough Street, knew no rest during his\r\nillness. Hundreds of people called to leave sympathetic little messages\r\nof goodwill. From Woolwich came a telegram from a party of children. An\r\nold bedridden man laboriously penned a letter, brought round by his aged\r\nwife, to say that Mr. Crooks might like to know that an \"ole bloke as is\r\npegging out fast\" was thinking of him all day, and hoping he would soon\r\nget well.\r\n\r\nThis message cheered the invalid greatly, and he sent back a reply that\r\nrenewed the old man's youth for weeks. For Crooks never lost his\r\ncheerfulness when lying bandaged in bed. He used to banter his wife and\r\ndaughters, and his Labour colleagues in Parliament who came to visit\r\nhim, until they had to hold their sides with laughter. His cheery doctor\r\nused to store up good stories for the invalid's delectation; but he\r\nalways had to admit that Crooks could cap them all with better ones.\r\n\r\nOnce back at work again, Crooks threw all the time and energy he could\r\nspare from Parliament and his Labour meetings into a campaign for\r\nfeeding starving school children. Perhaps the best instance of the\r\npeople's trust in him was supplied by what happened in consequence of a\r\npowerful plea for hungry children he made on the London County Council.\r\nThe Moderates were then in power, and he pleaded with them to persist no\r\nlonger in their policy of refusing to exercise their powers under the\r\nNecessitous School Children's Act, which enables them to spend public\r\nmoney on food for starving scholars.\r\n\r\nIt was nigh on midnight before he got an opportunity of raising the\r\nquestion, and then--according to the _Daily Mail_, which had often been\r\none of his bitterest opponents--he \"electrified his sleepy colleagues as\r\nhe expressed the agony of hungry children and the despair of parents\r\nunable to satisfy their cravings. The speech was spoken without a single\r\nnote; it came from his heart. When Mr. Crooks sat down, exhausted by the\r\neffort--he was far from well--there was a moment of dead silence. Then\r\nthere broke out the applause which relieved the tension. There was\r\nscarcely a dry eye in the Council chamber.\"\r\n\r\nIn the course of his speech to the Council Crooks said:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     There are no hard-hearted men and there are no hard-hearted women;\r\n     there are only men and women ignorant of the need. Only the other\r\n     day a teacher in one of our schools showed me a letter from a\r\n     mother of three fatherless girls. It ran:--\r\n\r\n          Dear Teacher,--Will you allow my little girls to\r\n          come home at half-past three? I shall have earned sixpence\r\n          by then, and shall be able to give them something warm to eat.\r\n          They have had nothing all day.\r\n\r\n     Here are we, satisfied after a good dinner. Yet I know that this\r\n     very night hundreds of little children have gone to bed with\r\n     nothing but a cup of cold water for their supper, and that in the\r\n     morning they will have nothing but water for their breakfasts. What\r\n     do you expect them to become? What sort of citizens of this great\r\n     Empire City will they make?\r\n\r\n     I have seen the poor as they live, and I tell you that, much as\r\n     they may forgive you for many things, they will never forgive you\r\n     for neglecting the children--the children stunted in body and mind\r\n     for want of food, old before their time, with the souls, not of\r\n     children, but of old men and women.\r\n\r\n     A nation which neglects its children is damned. You are neglecting\r\n     London's hungry children by leaving the provision of meals to\r\n     private subscriptions which all over London have failed to meet the\r\n     little people's need. You never talk of running the Army and Navy\r\n     and the defence of the Empire generally by means of private\r\n     subscriptions and charitable doles. Yet the thing that is of\r\n     greater importance at the present moment than the Army and Navy to\r\n     us, as an Imperial people, is that the children who are going to\r\n     inherit the responsibility of the government of our vast Empire\r\n     should be properly fed and clothed _now_.\r\n\r\n     What have you to say to facts like these? A woman, early the other\r\n     morning, as soon as the shutters were down, entered a pawnbroker's\r\n     shop, and took from under her shawl, in a shamefaced manner, a\r\n     small bundle. The pawnbroker's assistant unrolled the bundle, and\r\n     there, clean washed and scarcely dry, was the woman's chemise. She\r\n     had taken it off her body, washed and partly dried it, and to the\r\n     pawnbroker's assistant she said:\r\n\r\n     \"For the love of God, lend me sixpence on this.\"\r\n\r\n     \"I cannot,\" said the assistant. \"It's not worth it.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Then give me threepence,\" pleaded the woman. \"I must give my\r\n     children a mouthful before they go to school this morning.\"\r\n\r\n     You object to feed the children because it would increase the\r\n     rates. Yes, it would increase the rates by a farthing. But\r\n     indirectly you are increasing the rates to a far greater extent by\r\n     starving the children. By neglecting them now you will be compelled\r\n     to feed and shelter them later in life in workhouses and\r\n     infirmaries.\r\n\r\n     I appeal to you to rise to a sense of your responsibilities, and\r\n     see that these children are fed. If it meant that I should be\r\n     driven out of public life by feeding starving children out of the\r\n     rates, I should feed them out of the rates. I should then have done\r\n     my duty.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe appeal moved the Council deeply, but on a party vote he was\r\ndefeated, many of the Councillors who voted against him crowding round\r\nhim afterwards to assure him of their individual sympathy.\r\n\r\nThe sequel came the day after his speech was reported in the Press. From\r\nall parts of London he and his wife had cheques and postal orders\r\nshowered upon them from people in all walks of life, from little\r\nchildren to old people. Nearly £200 in all came to hand, together with\r\nhuge parcels of boots and clothing, every donor leaving it entirely in\r\nCrooks's hands as to how the money and the things were distributed, so\r\nlong as the needy children got them.\r\n\r\nThis is just the kind of thing that he deprecates, but, public bodies\r\nhaving failed to meet the need, he and his wife set to work, and did\r\ntheir best to meet it in their own neighbourhood. With the aid of a few\r\nfriends they got in touch with some of the poorest schools in the East\r\nEnd, and soon thousands of hungry school children were fed and hundreds\r\nof the naked clothed.\r\n\r\nCrooks gave the London County Council no rest on this subject. He went\r\non agitating until the Moderate majority in the succeeding winter at\r\nlast gave in and agreed to make the feeding of necessitous scholars a\r\npublic charge.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus we leave him, still in the ranks fighting. We must part from him\r\nwith a smile, since that is how he likes best to leave both friend and\r\nenemy. And those who heard him speak in the winter of 1908 at the City\r\nTemple smile every time they think of the occasion--a mass meeting of\r\nthe London Federation of Pleasant Sunday Afternoon Brotherhoods.\r\n\r\nNo written word can adequately describe the hilarious effect of Crooks's\r\nspeech. Without the man behind them, the words alone convey little, as I\r\nmany times have been made to feel keenly while writing this narrative.\r\nIndeed, one of Mr. Crooks's colleagues in Parliament, a staid, dull man\r\nof much wealth, accosted him in the House one afternoon with the remark:\r\n\"How is it, Mr. Crooks, that when I repeat your stories to my\r\nconstituents, they never laugh?\"\r\n\r\nAt the City Temple Crooks told his great audience how delighted he had\r\nbeen to observe the growth of the religious and civic spirit among the\r\nworking classes since this movement for Sunday afternoon meetings began.\r\n\r\n\"At the meetings in the early days,\" he said, \"you know how you used to\r\nbe troubled with the irrelevant questioner. I was present once when the\r\nspeaker, after narrating his experiences abroad, was asked whether he\r\nwas in favour of compulsory vaccination! Another time a man got up, and\r\nafter reading out a list of parsons who had been sentenced asked me what\r\nI had to say to that?\r\n\r\n\"'A bad lot,' I answered, 'but it doesn't shake my faith in Christianity\r\nany more than to-day's fog shakes my faith in the sun.\"\r\n\r\n\"On another occasion a man asked me what I meant by condemning betting,\r\nseeing that the aristocracy backed horses.\r\n\r\n\"'But the aristocracy know no better. You do. So set them an example.'\r\n\r\n\"Then there was the heckler who wanted to know whether I objected to a\r\nman leaving money for the propagation of atheism.\r\n\r\n\"'If he likes to do it, let him,' I answered. 'He's sure to regret it as\r\nsoon as he is dead.'\r\n\r\n\"And that reminds me,\" continued Crooks, \"of what happened at the last\r\nCounty Council election. A local undertaker, who had always supported me\r\nbefore, stopped me in the street to say he was going to vote on the\r\nother side this time.\r\n\r\n\"''Tain't as I don't believe in you, Mr. Crooks. I likes you as well as\r\never I did; but men in our calling must keep an eye on the party that\r\nbest helps business, you know!'\r\n\r\n\"I told him I did not understand.\r\n\r\n\"'Why,' said the undertaker, 'I could make a decent living when the\r\ndeath rate was 20 per 1,000. I can even get along nicely when it's 18;\r\nbut since you've bin on the move, Mr. Crooks, I can't make a living\r\nnohow, with a death rate no more'n 14.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\nAdult Sunday Schools, 213, 259\r\n\r\nAfforestation for unemployed, 265\r\n\r\n\r\nB\r\n\r\nBaby-farming in London, 94\r\n\r\nBalfour, Mr. Arthur, 17, 238, 261\r\n\r\nBaptist Union, Crooks addresses the, 257\r\n\r\nBarnett, Canon, 222, 290\r\n\r\nBeresford, Lord Charles, 186, 187\r\n\r\nBishop of London, The, 257\r\n\r\nBlackwall Tunnel, Crooks and the, 101-04\r\n\r\nBoarding-out children, 125\r\n\r\nBorough Councillor, Crooks as a, 68, 154-74, 212\r\n\r\nBrabazon Society and Poplar Workhouse, 291\r\n\r\nBrotherhoods, Men's, 300\r\n\r\nBurns, Mr. John, 68, 189, 195, 265, 266, 294\r\n\r\n\r\nC\r\n\r\nCampbell-Bannerman, Sir H., 195, 294\r\n\r\nCanada and the unemployed, 231, 267\r\n\r\nCentral Unemployed Committee, 232, 235\r\n\r\nChamberlain, Mr. Joseph, 214, 217\r\n\r\nChandler, Bishop, 23, 76\r\n\r\nChaplin, Mr. Henry, 115, 144, 185\r\n\r\nChesterton, Mr. G.
