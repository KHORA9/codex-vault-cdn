V.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Twenty-fifth Regiment, Connecticut Volunteers, (George P. Bissell,\r\nColonel), was recruited in Hartford and Tolland Counties, in the fall\r\nof 1862. The regiment was composed of the very best material, being\r\nalmost exclusively young men impelled by patriotic motives, and from\r\nthe first they took a high stand for efficiency and good discipline.\r\n\r\nLater in its history, when the regiment had been tried in marches and\r\nbattles, it was thus described by Adjutant-General Morse in his report\r\nto the Legislature for 1864: \"This is one of the best of our nine\r\nmonths' regiments and bore a conspicuous part in the advance upon, and\r\nthe campaign preceding, the fall of Port Hudson. By the bravery always\r\ndisplayed on the field of battle, and the patience and endurance\r\nmanifested on many long and arduous marches, it has won for itself a\r\nhigh and lasting reputation.\"\r\n\r\nThe Twenty-fifth was mustered into the United States service November\r\n11, 1862, and on the 14th sailed from Hartford for Centerville, L.I.,\r\nto join at that rendezvous the Banks Expedition. The muster-roll showed\r\n811 men thoroughly drilled and well appointed, except that they were\r\nwithout rifles which were later served to them on the ship after their\r\narrival on the Mississippi River. The regiment embarked November 29,\r\n1862, in two divisions;--one division of five companies under command\r\nof Colonel Bissell on the Steamer Mary Boardman; and the remainder\r\nunder command of Lieutenant-Colonel Stevens on the Steamer Empire City.\r\nThe destination of the expedition was unknown when the vessels sailed\r\nas the sealed orders were not to be opened until we had sailed\r\ntwenty-four hours to the southward and eastward. The orders, when\r\nopened, were found to be simply to report at Ship Island, off the mouth\r\nof the Mississippi River, allowing a stop at Dry Tortugas for coal if\r\nnecessary. The ships duly arrived at Ship Island and proceeded at once\r\nup the river to New Orleans where they arrived on the 14th of December,\r\n1862. On the 16th, the Mary Boardman, with several of the other ships\r\nproceeded to Baton Rouge, where they arrived the next day. The Empire\r\nCity landed the left wing of the regiment at Camp Parapet, just above\r\nNew Orleans. The forces landed at Baton Rouge after a brief bombardment\r\nof the city and the Twenty-fifth (five companies), went into camp first\r\non the United States Arsenal ground in the city and later near the\r\ncemetery, back of the city, where after some delay the left wing joined\r\nthe colonel's command and the regiment was once more united and in\r\nfighting trim. The regiment was first brigaded under General Albert E.\r\nPayne of Wisconsin, a noble and brave officer, afterwards with the\r\nThirteenth Connecticut. The Twenty-sixth Maine and One-Hundred and\r\nFifty-ninth New York, under Colonel H. W. Birge, of the Thirteenth\r\nConnecticut, as Brigade Commander, an officer of rare ability and\r\nbravery and a disciplinarian of the best stamp. Under his command the\r\nTwenty-fifth served during its entire term of service. He led them in\r\nmany battles and marches and while he was strictness personified, he\r\nwas so magnanimous, brave, reasonable and such a thorough soldier, that\r\nthe men worshiped him and would follow him into the face of any fire.\r\nNow that he is gone they revere his memory.\r\n\r\nThe first work of the regiment was on the advance on Port Hudson, March\r\n10, 1863, when Colonel Bissell, in command of his own regiment, two\r\ndetachments of cavalry and a regular army battery, occupied Bayou\r\nMontesano, constructed earthworks and built a bridge across Bayou Sara.\r\nThis bridge was designed by Sergeant William Webster of Company I,\r\nafter a West Point engineer had despaired of the job. The regiment was\r\nseven miles in advance of the rest of the army and in a very exposed\r\nand dangerous position. This position they held under a frequently\r\nsevere fire till the remainder of the army came up when they joined the\r\ncolumn and went on to Port Hudson. They were in the front of the land\r\nforces when Farragut sailed by the forts in the Flagship Hartford. From\r\nthe banks of the river the Twenty-fifth witnessed this grand\r\nbombardment and the burning of the frigate Mississippi in the night.\r\n\r\nWhen the object of the expedition had been accomplished (to use the\r\nwords of General Banks' order), the regiment returned to Baton Rouge,\r\npassing a wet and dreary night in Camp Misery, a night which will never\r\nbe forgotten, nor will any one ever forget the noble act of\r\nQuartermaster John S. Ives, who rode his tired horse several miles to\r\nBaton Rouge and brought out to the men coffee, which they managed to\r\nprepare over small fires and which no doubt saved many a man's life.\r\nAfter a short stay at Baton Rouge, the army made another advance on the\r\nwest bank of the Mississippi, starting March 28th, 1863, marching with\r\nfrequent skirmishes, sailing up the Atchafalaya bayou and landing at\r\nIrish Bend, where the regiment engaged in its first real battle, April\r\n14th, 1863. The severity of this battle may be judged of as we read in\r\nthe Adjutant-general's report: \"Our loss, as you will see from the\r\naccompanying returns of the casualties has been very severe, being in\r\nall, ninety-six killed and wounded out of 350 with which the regiment\r\nwent into action.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this point the regiment marched up to within six miles of the Red\r\nRiver and of this march the regimental report speaks thus: \"What with\r\nour loss in battle, details for special service and the number who have\r\ngiven out on our very long and severe marches, this regiment is much\r\nreduced and has today only 299 men present of whom but 248 are fit for\r\nduty. You will thus see, though this campaign has been eminently\r\nsuccessful, driving the enemy before us through the entire valley of\r\nthe Teche, from its mouth to its source, it has been very trying upon\r\nthe troops. Four engagements and 300 miles march in twenty days call\r\nfor proportionate suffering which cannot be avoided.\"\r\n\r\nDuring May and June the regiment was actively engaged in the siege of\r\nPort Hudson, and was almost constantly under fire in the trenches and\r\nin the various assaults on that stronghold, leading the advance on the\r\n23rd of May when a junction was formed with General Auger's column\r\nwhich completed the investment of the place. During all the siege the\r\nregiment was constantly in the front and finally participated in the\r\nglories of the surrender of the fortress on the 8th of July, having\r\nbeen in almost constant, arduous duty, marching and fighting since\r\nearly in March.\r\n\r\nAfter the surrender of Port Hudson, the regiment returned to\r\nDonaldsonville, where it encamped till the expiration of term of\r\nservice. Colonel Bissell sent to General Banks and offered himself and\r\nhis command to remain longer in the department if our services were\r\nneeded; but he replied that there would probably be no more fighting,\r\nand thanking us for our offer, he issued an order returning us to our\r\nhomes. The regiment was finally mustered out at Hartford, August 26,\r\n1863.\r\n\r\nIn closing this brief sketch of the history of the gallant Twenty-fifth\r\nRegiment, a few words may be permitted in praise of the good and true\r\nmen of which it was composed. With very few and unimportant exceptions,\r\nthey were of the best sort of men, who were ever banded together for\r\nthe defense of their country. They submitted to rigorous discipline\r\ncheerfully, they marched promptly and they fought bravely. A review of\r\nofficial records shows that the regiment was complimented a great many\r\ntimes by General Grover A. Birge for the promptness with which it\r\nalways moved and for its bravery as shown time and again in battle and\r\nunder severe fire.\r\n\r\nEver ready and always pushed to the front in time of danger of an\r\nattack, the Twenty-fifth was an organization of which the state need\r\nnot be ashamed. When it was in the field it was an honor to the army\r\nand to the volunteer service of our country, and now that fifty years\r\nhave rolled by the heart of many a survivor swells with just pride as\r\nhe says to his children and grandchildren: \"I was a member of the\r\nTwenty-fifth Connecticut.\"\r\n\r\nIn closing this brief sketch of the Twenty-fifth Regiment, of which\r\nColonel Bissell is the author, you will see that he was very proud of\r\nthe men under his command and if you could have seen him drilling his\r\nregiment at that time, as I still see him in memory, you would know\r\nthat he fairly worshiped them. I am sure the men would have followed\r\nhim into any fire against overwhelming odds. And now he is gone, the\r\nmen that are left cherish his memory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERESTING REMINISCENCES AND EXPERIENCES BY SAMUEL K. ELLIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn opening the subject of my experiences as a private in the War of the\r\nRebellion, I hardly know how to begin as this is the first time I have\r\nattempted to write at length upon this subject. I earnestly hope that\r\nall those who read this little book will excuse all grammatical errors.\r\n\r\nFifty years have come and gone and as my life has been spared to see\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of my army life, and as I kept a diary during\r\nmy term of service in the War of the Rebellion, I thought it no more\r\nthan right and just to myself and descendants that I leave in book form\r\nsome of the many experiences I saw and passed through during that time.\r\nIt seemed to me that it was a grand opportunity on this the fiftieth\r\nanniversary to do it, if I ever did. Hoping that this account of my\r\narmy life may be highly appreciated and prized by my children and\r\ngrandchildren and any others that may be interested, I will endeavor to\r\ngive a complete account as I saw and recorded events.\r\n\r\nI was a Vernon Center boy but was working in the town of Glastonbury,\r\nwhen the war broke out, with Hubbard and Broadhead at teaming and farm\r\nwork. At this time the gloom was deep but the people were not\r\ndiscouraged. At the request of the governors of eighteen loyal states,\r\nPresident Lincoln, on July 2nd, 1862, called out three hundred thousand\r\nmen for three years' service, and on August 4, ordered a call for three\r\nhundred thousand men for nine months. At this time it was hard to tell\r\nwhat one's duty was, but I had made up my mind to go and of course I\r\nhave never been sorry, as I look back and say with just pride that I\r\nwas one who went out to help save our Republic from dissolution and\r\npreserve civilization itself on this Western Hemisphere from\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nI fear I have been wandering from my subject already but I could not\r\nhelp giving expression to the thoughts that were burning within me.\r\nYes, I was a Vernon Center boy, my father moving there when I was\r\nsixteen years old. I enlisted September 2nd, 1862, in Company G,\r\nTwenty-fifth Regiment, C.V. Our company met in Hartford, near the old\r\nState House (what is now City Hall), on the morning of September 8th.\r\nWe marched down to camp before noon on that day, but instead of finding\r\ntents to sleep in we found a string of barracks long enough for a\r\nthousand men. I want to tell you how they looked as I remember them.\r\nThey resembled the cattle sheds that we see nowadays at our fairs,\r\nexcept that they were built with three tiers, instead of one. The bunks\r\nwere made for two men, one above the other, about four feet wide. Of\r\ncourse we had to have a little straw to lay over the \"soft side\" of the\r\nboards. This building I believe we named \"The Palace Hotel\" because of\r\nits \"great beauty and comfort.\" I wonder if you can imagine how\r\ntempting those bunks looked after leaving the good beds that we had\r\nbeen accustomed to. I think there were some pretty homesick boys that\r\nfirst night in our new quarters, if I remember correctly. But the food!\r\nWell, I don't think I had better say much about that, for I had been a\r\nfarmer boy and I think I had the advantage over some of the boys, as I\r\nknew what it was to rough it and go without my dinner in the winter\r\ntime when the days were short and I would be out in the woods all day\r\nchopping, or drawing logs with an ox team.\r\n\r\nWe left our old camp ground on November 18, 1862, with flying colors,\r\nto the tune of \"Dixie\" and \"The Star Spangled Banner,\" and other\r\npatriotic airs. But all this did not occur without many tearful eyes,\r\nfor the streets were crowded with friends and loved ones that were to\r\nbe left behind. We pulled out of the dock at the foot of State street\r\non the steamer City of Hartford about four o'clock in the afternoon. We\r\narrived at Williamsburg, L.I., early the next morning, and the good\r\npeople of that city treated us with all the sandwiches and coffee that\r\nwe wanted. We marched about ten miles, with a portable bureau or what\r\nyou might call a knapsack on our backs, before one o'clock that day, to\r\nthe Centerville race course. We pitched our tents and made things as\r\ncomfortable as we could for the night as you must know it was quite\r\ncold weather, it being the last of November. There is no place that\r\nreveals the real character of a man so quickly and so clearly as a\r\nshelter tent in an army on the field. All there is in him, be it noble\r\nor base, strong or weak, is brought to the front by the peculiar\r\nexperiences of the soldier. The life of a soldier in camp is tedious\r\nand wearisome, but when a regiment starts for the field under a\r\ngovernment not prepared for war (ours was not), the real trials of the\r\nsoldier begin. When our regiment arrived at the camp at Centerville,\r\nafter a march of ten miles, we found that no provision had been made\r\nfor us,--and it now being the last of November. In the small hours of\r\nthe morning Colonel Bissell drilled the regiment on a double quick\r\nmovement on the race course to warm us up. The regiment was ordered to\r\nembark on November 29. The Twenty-fifth regiment was to have started on\r\nSaturday when lo! just as we were drawn up in line preparatory to a\r\nstart, General Banks' orderly gallops up, bringing an order for\r\nCompanies C, D, F, and G to remain behind and go with the Twenty-sixth\r\nConnecticut. Here was a pretty fix, for tents, baggage, and everything\r\nhad already gone. To add to our troubles up came one of the hardest\r\nrainstorms, such as only Long Island can produce. As there was no other\r\nplace, we were compelled to quarter in the old barn which was later\r\nturned into a guard house, where we slept on bare boards. Not a wisp of\r\nstraw had we to lie on, for it was so rainy we could not gather any.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the fourth of December, we received marching orders,\r\nand at about 8 o'clock, we were very glad to get away from this\r\nforsaken place, which we did in a hurry. We arrived in Brooklyn about\r\n12 o'clock that night and I assure you it was no easy matter to find a\r\nplace to stay till morning. It was a long cold December night. The men\r\ngot places wherever they could find them. I and several other comrades\r\nstayed with a Doctor Green. We were up early in the morning and the\r\ndoctor wanted us all to stay and have breakfast with him, an invitation\r\nwhich we accepted with thanks. I wrote a letter to my mother while\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the fifth of December we embarked on the steamer\r\nEmpire City with the Twenty-sixth Connecticut Regiment. The men of the\r\nTwenty-sixth were in the hold of the vessel while the Twenty-fifth men\r\ntook a deck passage which we didn't appreciate especially at this\r\nseason of the year, December 6th. We left the Atlantic Dock, Brooklyn,\r\nat six o'clock that morning. We hadn't been out long before the water\r\nbecame quite rough and the steamer plunged and rolled dreadfully which\r\nmade the soldiers very sea-sick.\r\n\r\nDecember 7th was dark and boisterous and the good old ship creaked and\r\nswayed on the mighty deep. By the way, I hadn't been sea-sick since we\r\nleft the Atlantic dock, but I could not help laughing, the first day we\r\nwere out, to see the guards of the vessel from stem to stern lined up\r\nwith anxious sea-gazers, their knees knocking together, their\r\ncountenances ashen and a very intimate connection evidently existing\r\nbetween the stomach and the mouth. Even my risibiles were aroused\r\nthough myself not entirely insensible to the attractions of Neptune.\r\n\r\nDecember 8th. It was Sunday and when daylight came it brought with it a\r\ncalmer sea and a more jolly set of soldiers, although the water was\r\nseveral inches deep on deck. That day was spent, as all others, without\r\nany religious exercises so we had nothing to do but watch the\r\nporpoises, of which there had been a great many in sight all day.\r\n\r\nWe had been out of sight of land since the previous day at noon. Well,\r\nwe had found out where our expedition was going. It was going to sea.\r\nOne thing was certain, we were going pretty far south.\r\n\r\nDecember 9th. The weather had become quite fine. The boys had, most of\r\nthem, gotten over being sea-sick. As the Twenty-sixth boys began to\r\nfeel as though they had rather be on deck than down in that dirty hole,\r\nwe were in pretty close quarters, for I think there were as many as\r\ntwelve hundred men on this old unseaworthy ship which had been used as\r\na transport in the California trade for a great many years. So I was\r\ntold by Harlan Skinner, who went out as Sutler's clerk of the\r\nTwenty-fifth Regiment. (He was a brother of Town Clerk Francis B.\r\nSkinner of Rockville and went to California on board of her in 1849.)\r\n\r\nDecember 10th. We were still out of sight of land. Some of us might be\r\nimagined reading the Bible or some other interesting book and others\r\nwere lying asleep on deck, while the rest were watching and wondering\r\nwhere we were going to land, I suppose.\r\n\r\nDecember 11th. It was much warmer, and very pleasant. We were still out\r\nof sight of land. Spying an English vessel, we ran up the Stars and\r\nStripes and they ran up their flag to let us know that all was right.\r\nSome of the boys sang out, just for a little fun, that the old Rebel\r\ngunboat Alabama was in sight.\r\n\r\nDecember 12th we came in sight of the coast of Florida. We had seen the\r\ntrees and the snow white beach about all day. We also saw several\r\nlighthouses. The porpoises and flying fish attracted a great deal of\r\nattention and when a school came in sight, all eyes were turned upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nDecember 13th. It has been very pleasant and there has been a smooth\r\nsea, consequently we have had a very pleasant day's sail, with a cool\r\nbreeze. We have been out of sight of land all day, and we long to be on\r\nshore once more. As we are so dove-tailed in, when we try to lie down\r\nat night, we get very little sleep.\r\n\r\nDecember 14th, Sunday. We were now in the Gulf of Mexico and there had\r\nnot been a living thing in sight all day. We had a sermon preached on\r\ndeck. The text was, \"Thou shall not take the name of the Lord, thy God,\r\nin vain.\"\r\n\r\nDecember 15th. We arrived at Ship Island at noon and found about the\r\nmost God forsaken, miserable hole, man ever got into. The sand was\r\nankle deep everywhere. And such a lot of Negroes; shiftless, lazy dogs,\r\nblack as the ace of spades and twice as natural. But the little \"nigs\"\r\nkill me outright, they looking so much like a lot of monkeys, I know of\r\nnothing so comical. I could sit half the morning watching them and\r\nhearing them jabber.\r\n\r\nDecember 16th. We arrived at the mouth of the Mississippi River. A\r\npilot came aboard and took us over the bar in the river in compliance\r\nwith the rules of navigation. We had a very pleasant day's sail coming\r\nup the old Mississippi. We saw many half clad slaves on the banks who\r\nseemed much pleased to think that Massa Lincoln's soldiers were coming\r\nto set them free. We arrived in New Orleans, La., on the 17th of\r\nDecember and got our fill of oranges and victuals before the peddlers\r\nwere stopped from supplying us.\r\n\r\nI want to tell you here what a beautiful sight a sunrise and sunset is\r\nat sea. There is something very fascinating about it.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Carrollton, just above New Orleans, and went ashore at\r\nCamp Parapet, on the morning of December 18. We pitched our tents in\r\nthe afternoon and were very glad to be on land once more and have room\r\nto lie down at night.\r\n\r\nThis completes my narrative of our sea voyage which I certainly have\r\nnever forgotten, after having such an experience as I had on a vessel\r\ncrowded to its utmost capacity and a deck passage at that.\r\n\r\nDecember 19th. We have cleaned up, washed our clothing and are drying\r\nit upon our backs, thereby saving the trouble of hanging it on the\r\nbushes to dry.\r\n\r\nDecember 20th. We received our rifles and now I suppose we shall have\r\nto put on our accoutrements and get right down to drilling in the\r\nmanual of arms.\r\n\r\nDecember 21st. I was on guard for the first time at Camp Parapet. I am\r\nbeginning to find out that camp life in Hartford, Connecticut, was\r\nquite different from camp life of instruction at Camp Parapet, La.\r\n\r\nFrom this date I shall omit many of the dates and unimportant events of\r\ncamp life, as one day we drill the next have inspection, so every day\r\nbrings us many troubles.\r\n\r\nChristmas Day. We don't expect a very elaborate dinner. No doubt we\r\nshall be thinking of the good things our friends and loved ones are\r\nhaving at home. Such was a soldier's life fifty years ago.\r\n\r\nDecember 30th. Wrote a letter to mother and put some small magnolia\r\nleaves, a magnolia bud, a live oak, a cypress and several other\r\nvarieties into it which I have in my possession to this day. I had an\r\nexquisitely fine sympathy with vegetable life in all its forms and\r\nespecially with trees.\r\n\r\nI wrote at that time: \"The country charms me with its magnificent lemon\r\nand orange groves. The trees are perfectly bowed down with their weight\r\nof fruit. Upon my word, I am in love with the Sunny South. I think when\r\nthis cruel war is over and I can find my affinity, I shall settle down\r\nin this beautiful country for life. But I am not thinking much about\r\nthat just now, for the girls are not much in love with the Union\r\nsoldiers. The ladies here wear secesh cockades in their bonnets and it\r\nis really amusing to see the curl of the lip and the contempt of\r\ncountenance with which they sweep by us. Of course it is no wonder,\r\nwhen we take into consideration the way they have always lived, and\r\nthought that they were fighting for a just cause.\"\r\n\r\nThe object of our expedition was to cooperate with General Grant in the\r\nreduction of Vicksburg, but General Banks did not know until he arrived\r\nat New Orleans that Port Hudson was fortified and manned by almost as\r\nlarge a force as he could bring against it, or that fifty miles west of\r\nNew Orleans was a force of five or six thousand men ready to move on\r\nthe city and cut his lines of communication the moment he moved up the\r\nriver. In addition to this he was furnished with transportation for\r\nonly one division of his army and instructions from General Grant.\r\nThere was only one thing that could be done and that was to destroy the\r\nConfederate Army west of the Mississippi; before he could, with safety,\r\nleave New Orleans in the rear, and advance on Port Hudson. Therefore,\r\nconcentrating his army at Donaldsonville, we marched across the country\r\nto Burwick's Bay and followed up the Bayou Teche to Alexandra, on the\r\nRed River, to the Mississippi. We advanced upon Port Hudson from the\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of January, 1863, our regiments at New Orleans were sent up\r\nthe river. We went on board a little steamer, called the Laurel Hill at\r\nabout eight o'clock in the evening. We arrived in Baton Rouge about one\r\no'clock on the sixteenth of January and had our tents pitched before\r\nnight. We were brigaded with the Thirteenth Connecticut, the\r\nTwenty-sixth Maine and the One Hundred and Fifty-ninth New York, under\r\nColonel H. W. Birge as brigade commander. These regiments formed the\r\nThird Brigade of the Fourth Division of the Nineteenth Army Corps,\r\nGeneral Grover division commander.\r\n\r\nJanuary 25th. We were now in the presence of the enemy and the position\r\nassigned to the Twenty-fifth was on the extreme left in advance and we\r\nwere getting our first taste of active service.\r\n\r\nJanuary 26th. Our camp was about half a mile from the town, just on the\r\nedge of a dense forest and cypress swamp. Last night I went out on\r\npicket duty for the first time in Baton Rouge. General Payne warned us\r\nthat we must look out for the enemy. In the afternoon the officer of\r\nthe day came running his horse out where we were on picket and ordered\r\nus to stand by our arms for there was danger of an attack. Toward night\r\nwe had a man badly wounded and he was sent to the hospital. During the\r\nnight there was a great deal of firing upon the out-posts. We certainly\r\nthought there was going to be an attack and half the camp was up all\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nJanuary 27th. I came in from picket in the morning. We were relieved by\r\nthe Twenty-sixth Maine. We fired off our rifles at a target and started\r\nfor camp. We thought sometimes that Louisiana was a very \"quare\r\ncountry,\" as the Irish man said when he got lost in the woods, and ran\r\nup against an owl in a tree, and thought it was a man calling to him.\r\nThe woods were plentifully stocked with game and we could hear most\r\nevery sound from the hooting of the owls, growling of wild hogs, to the\r\nsnarl of the wild-cat and cry of the opossum. It was also a strange\r\nsight to see the limbs festooned from tree to tree. Some of them were\r\ngigantic. The trees were covered with moss or vines that encircled\r\nthem. Strange as it may seem, we gathered this moss for bedding. I\r\nwonder it didn't kill the whole lot of us, but I think the country\r\nagreed with me, for I could sleep right on the ground under the\r\nmagnolia trees with nothing but a log for a pillow, while some of our\r\nsentry kept watch.\r\n\r\n    [_January 28, 1913. It is with great sorrow that I sit down to\r\n    resume this narrative of my army life, for since my last writing I\r\n    have lost a dear son by death. He died on the morning of January\r\n    7th, after a long and painful illness of seventeen weeks, and was\r\n    laid to rest in Grove Hill cemetery on the afternoon of January\r\n    9th. Strange that this affliction should come on the fiftieth\r\n    anniversary of my hardships in the Civil War, but I thought that I\r\n    couldn't proceed until I had made mention of this sad trial._]\r\n\r\nAnd now I must resume my story as best I can. For some weeks we had\r\nbeen very busy doing picket and guard duty, and acquiring the use of\r\nfire-arms. Everything seemed peaceful and quiet, but it was fearfully\r\ncold. It was very singular weather. Following every rain-storm it\r\ncleared intensely cold for several days; then it became very hot again;\r\nnext we had another storm to subdue the intense heat. I don't think\r\nthese sudden changes agreed with the men for we had a large number on\r\nthe sick list. Our ranks were very much reduced by sickness. Some of\r\nthe companies dwindled down to about half their original number. The\r\nresult was we had to work very hard; every day we had to have a large\r\nnumber for picket and guard duty. It was a comical sight to see the men\r\ngoing out on picket. First we had our overcoats and fixings, then our\r\ncartridge box and belt, then in a sling a good sized blanket and a\r\nrubber blanket, then the haversack with a day's rations and lastly the\r\ncoffee cup and canteen. The boys got up some fine dishes, although we\r\nhardly knew how to name some of them, but they were fine. I managed to\r\nget hold of some fish and made a delicious fry. Soaked it over night\r\nwith some hard tack and the next morning threw the pieces into a frying\r\npan (that our company had confiscated) along with a little salt pork;\r\nto this I added a little concentrated milk that I happened to have;\r\nnext toasted some bread and poured the whole over it; why it was a dish\r\nfit for anybody. We were glad to be able to get some soft bread; at\r\nfirst we couldn't get anything but hard tack and very little of that.\r\nFresh meat we hadn't tasted since we landed till one day, when out on\r\npicket, one of our boys caught a pig and we forthwith skinned and\r\nroasted it. You can imagine that that pig tasted pretty good after\r\ngoing without meat for over a month. The next day when we were out on\r\npicket, a contraband brought us some fresh eggs and sweet potatoes, but\r\nsuch instances were not very common. Why I became a nine-days' wonder\r\non returning to camp and relating my experience. We managed to get some\r\nfun out of camp life, and my health was good (about this time I was\r\nflourishing like the owl of the desert and the pelican of the\r\nwilderness). One thing we missed was books. The only books we had were\r\nour Testaments which I enjoyed reading very much, for I meant to read\r\nsome of it every day. The Testament I had was presented to me, about\r\nthe time we left Hartford for the seat of war, by a Vernon lady, and I\r\nhave it in my possession yet. I prize it still as a great treasure.\r\n\r\nFebruary 22d, Sunday, Washington's Birthday. Had inspection in the\r\nforenoon and in afternoon we had a sermon preached to us by our\r\nchaplain, Mr. Oviate, whom some might remember when he preached in\r\nSomers, Connecticut.\r\n\r\nFebruary 23rd. I was detailed to go on guard duty this morning for 24\r\nhours. The day was celebrated as Washington's Birthday and the boys had\r\na ball game. At sunset we had a dress parade and brigade review. Most\r\nof the boys were getting pretty short of money, and if we sent any\r\nletters home we had to have them franked as soldiers' letters. This\r\nmeans that soldiers' letters can be sent without a stamp.\r\n\r\nFebruary 24th. Came off guard this morning; had the forenoon to myself;\r\nin the afternoon we had a brigade drill under General Birge in the\r\nunpleasant duty of reversed arms and rest, a duty which we were called\r\nupon to perform quite often those days.\r\n\r\nFebruary 25th. I went to the hospital with Sergeant Sam Harding of our\r\ncompany. It was a sickening sight to go over the hospital and see the\r\nthin and wasted sufferers, many of them stretched on the floor with\r\nonly a blanket and scarce a comfort, let alone a luxury of any kind;\r\nmany of them stricken down in their strength by swamp fever; and one by\r\none they dropped off. They had not even seen the enemy. Poor fellows!\r\n\r\nFebruary 26th. It was a very rainy day and we stayed in our tents and\r\ncleaned our muskets. Mortar and gunboats are daily arriving at this\r\nport. We have six of the former and four or five of the latter. The\r\nConfederate gunboats are continually making reconnoissance up the river\r\nand occasionally give Port Hudson a taste of their shells. But most of\r\nthem give her a wide berth and I think they had better. By the way I\r\nwant to tell you how hard it was for us poor boys to get reading\r\nmatter. When the New York papers arrived they commanded 25 and 30 cents\r\napiece. You can see that we fellows had to go without, for we had not\r\nreceived a cent of pay since arriving here. You can't imagine what it\r\nis to be cut off from all communication from the outer world for a week\r\nor ten days at a time as we were and during that interval hear nothing\r\nbut discouraging rumors and false reports circulated by the Rebels.\r\n\r\nFebruary 27th. Came off guard in a soaking rain, in a very cross state\r\nof mind, but being neither sugar nor salt didn't melt away; but I felt\r\nthat I could stand it awhile longer if our hard-tack and salt horse\r\nheld out as well as it had and I felt it would, for I noticed that it\r\nstood by pretty well.\r\n\r\nHaving a prisoner consigned to my tender mercy to be fed on the bread\r\nof affliction and waters of repentance until further orders, this same\r\nprisoner did at dead hour of night break from the guard-house and\r\nabscond to his quarters, did there fare sumptuously on hard-tack and\r\nsalt-horse. This coming to the ears of the colonel he did get angry\r\nwith the officer of the guard and sending this same officer of the\r\nguard a pair of hand-cuffs, did order to arrest this delinquent and\r\nconfine him in close quarters and in this performance a spirited\r\nencounter did thereupon take place in which the offender did get upset\r\nin one corner and the officer very nearly in the other; this criminal\r\nbeing finally secured did create such a row he was forced to be gagged\r\nand bound hand and foot.\r\n\r\nThat the weather hath proved very unpleasant for some time raining hard\r\nmost of the time when your humble servant did hope to go round and view\r\nthe pretty maidens of Baton Rouge and now that our three commissioned\r\nofficers not knowing better than to all fall sick at once and go to the\r\nhospital, it bringeth us many cares when we had to have Lieutenant\r\nGoodell of Company F detailed to take command of our company and that\r\nthe paymaster, (that much desired individual), hath again disappointed\r\nus and we are here as usual without a cent to buy anything for our\r\ncomfort or luxury of any kind.\r\n\r\nMarch 7th. However, this camp life was not to last. Admiral Farragut\r\nwished to run his fleet past the batteries of Port Hudson so that we\r\nmight intercept the Red River traffic and cooperate with General Grant\r\nat Vicksburg. Therefore he asked General Banks to make a demonstration\r\nbehind the fortress. This movement was intended to divert the attention\r\nof the enemy. General Banks at once put his army in motion, and our\r\narmy, with a squadron of cavalry and a battery of regular artillery\r\nmen, commenced the advance.\r\n\r\nMarch 9th. Had marching orders this morning and struck our tents about\r\nseven o'clock. And we have been here all day waiting for orders to\r\nstart.\r\n\r\nMarch 10th. We had marching orders this morning and left camp about\r\nfive o'clock; when we got outside the picket lines, our regiment was\r\ndetailed to do skirmish duty and we immediately deployed on both sides\r\nof the road and into the woods, when we came to the remnants of a\r\nbridge that had been destroyed by the Confederates. We halted here and\r\nour regiment was sent out on picket duty for the night.\r\n\r\nMarch 11th. This morning we had a sharp skirmish with the enemy. One\r\nman was killed in Company I. His name was Rockwell.\r\n\r\nMarch 12th. Last night one-half of our regiment stood by our arms for\r\nfear of an attack. Sergeant Benjamin Turner and myself were up together\r\non the same post. Our army at this time was within cannon shot of the\r\nConfederate works, but they could not get their guns up in time to be\r\nof any service. We were witnesses of a terrible scene, at 1:20 A.M. Two\r\nrockets burst into the air and in an instant all the guns of the\r\nfortress lit up the darkness with the flash of their firing. The fleet\r\nreplied and until half past one, the roar of one hundred and fifty guns\r\nwas incessant. To add terror to the awful scene, the U.S. Frigate\r\nMississippi, which had grounded, was set on fire to save her from\r\ncapture. She was soon wrapped in flames and lighted up the sky for\r\nmiles around. This good old gunboat which had been in so many battles\r\nwent up with a terrific explosion. This desperate enterprise consisted\r\nof four ships, and three gunboats, the latter being lashed to the port\r\nside of the ships. But only the Hartford, which flew the Admiral's\r\ndauntless blue, and her consort, the little Albatross, succeeded in\r\nrunning past the batteries. The other ships were disabled by the\r\nenemy's fire and dropped down stream. The Mississippi, which had no\r\nconsort, grounded and to save the lives of her men was abandoned and\r\nfired.\r\n\r\nMarch 15th. We started at two o'clock on our return march for Baton\r\nRouge. When we had been on our way a short time, a hard thunder shower\r\ncame up, and it rained hard until we halted for camp about eight miles\r\nfrom Baton Rouge. It was a wet, muddy place, and we named it Camp\r\nMisery. It was very dark and it continued to rain at times during all\r\nthat long dreary night. Our quartermaster, John Ives, furnished us with\r\ncoffee which he brought from Baton Rouge. I think that we must have had\r\nit about every hour during the night.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DR. ALDEN B. SKINNER\r\n               Deceased\r\n               1st Surgeon 25th Regiment, Connecticut Volunteers, who\r\n                   enlisted at the age of 62.]\r\n\r\nI cannot refrain from speaking right here of our first surgeon, Dr.\r\nAlden Skinner, who went out with the Twenty-fifth Regiment. For it was\r\nat Camp Misery that Dr. Alden Skinner, father of Town Clerk Francis B.\r\nSkinner, contracted a cold that developed into pneumonia and resulted\r\nin his death a short time later. Dr. Skinner, after whom the Rockville\r\nSons of Veterans named their camp, was a highly respected Rockville\r\nphysician, who went with us down into that Rebel stronghold in 1862, as\r\nmany in town will remember. He was a man of many noble qualities. I\r\nknew him personally, for I had lived with him one winter when I\r\nattended school in Rockville. I felt it a great personal loss, as well\r\nas a loss to the regiment when he died. I desire to express myself at\r\nsome length relative to this good man who gave his life for our\r\ncountry's cause fifty years ago about March 30th, 1863. He was very\r\nkind to me when we were encamped at Baton Rouge and especially when\r\nthat thunder shower came up, as we were marching back from our first\r\nadvance on Port Hudson. This experience was on Sunday, March 15, 1863.\r\nDr. Skinner was on horseback and I can see him now in memory, as he was\r\nin that drenching rain, wet to the skin, as all were. That was the last\r\ntime I ever saw Dr. Skinner, for he died a few days after in the\r\nhospital at Baton Rouge. He was brought home and was laid to rest in\r\nour beautiful Grove Hill Cemetery.\r\n\r\nMarch 16th. It cleared off very pleasant this morning. Had breakfast of\r\nhard-tack and coffee. We had orders to march, about three o'clock in\r\nthe afternoon. We marched about ten miles and went into camp on the\r\nbank of the Mississippi River. We managed to get some fence rails,\r\nbuild a fire and dry off, I was so drenched it took me nearly all day\r\nto get thoroughly dry. I felt much happier upon this old cotton\r\nplantation, for it was about as pleasant a place as I had seen in\r\nLouisiana. We were situated on a high bluff overlooking the Mississippi\r\nRiver, which spread out before us like a broad lake. The banks were\r\nlined with live-oak, and back of us were dense forests. Hardly had we\r\narrived when I was detailed to go on guard duty. Pretty rough on a\r\nfellow who hadn't slept any for about forty-eight hours, but most of us\r\nwere in the same predicament. We were a pretty sleepy set to go on\r\nguard but we had to stand it, two hours on and four off, until morning,\r\nwhen our cavalry were driven back upon us without loss. At three\r\no'clock, I was relieved and lying down on the ground I slept like a\r\nstone till eight o'clock when the new guard came on. Here let me say,\r\nthat the thunder storm we had on a Sunday afternoon was very likely the\r\nmeans of saving many lives, as the Confederates, when they found that\r\nwe were retreating, turned out infantry, cavalry and artillery and\r\npressed hard upon us but the rain Providentially deterred them. The\r\nThirteenth and Twenty-fifth Connecticut Regiments covered the\r\nretreating column.\r\n\r\nMarch 17th found us still in Camp Alden, for so we had named our new\r\ncamp ground. In the afternoon a half dozen of us went out on a foraging\r\nexpedition. We spotted a cow, which a bullet soon laid low. When we got\r\nher dressed, we started for a sugar plantation, a short distance away.\r\nWe found it entirely deserted but lots of sugar and molasses, as this\r\nhad not been confiscated by the United States government. We helped\r\nourselves and managed to get a small quantity of the sweetening\r\ningredient up to camp, where we received a warm reception. We were all\r\nout of sugar for our coffee and also meat for soup. That was about all\r\nthe old cow was fit for. We held dress parade at sunset in marching\r\ncostume. I was quite ragged by this time, having torn the legs nearly\r\noff my trousers, and my blouse had been badly torn while skirmishing\r\nthrough the woods and cane brakes.\r\n\r\nMarch 18th. Spent most of the forenoon mending the holes in my\r\nbreeches. In the afternoon visited the Twelfth Connecticut regiment for\r\nthe first time in Louisiana. Saw some of the Hartford boys and had a\r\ngood time generally. After dress-parade went out on a foraging\r\nexpedition, with several others, after fence rails, as we had to have a\r\nfire to keep warm, also to make coffee and soup. I am sure the Rebs had\r\ngood reason to bring \"railing accusations\" against us, for I am quite\r\ncertain there wasn't a rail left within several miles of Baton Rouge.\r\n\r\nMarch 19th. There was an order for inspection of arms this morning.\r\nWhile waiting I, with several others, was detailed to go out foraging\r\nafter corn. Went out a short distance and got all that we could bring\r\ninto camp. We received marching orders at nine o'clock in the evening.\r\n\r\nMarch 20th. We were up early and on our way at four o'clock this\r\nmorning. After a weary, hot march we reached our old camp-ground at\r\nBaton Rouge at seven o'clock. As we marched past General Banks'\r\nheadquarters he came out and saluted, while the bands of the different\r\nregiments played and we marched past at shoulder arms. That night we\r\nlay on the ground again for it was too late and the men were too tired\r\nto pitch the tents.\r\n\r\nMarch 21st. In the morning we pitched our tents, cleaned up and put our\r\nold Camp Grover in order once more.\r\n\r\nMarch 22nd, Sunday. We were ordered to be ready for inspection but\r\nthere was none on account of some of the rifles being loaded. Toward\r\nnight we were ordered to be ready for marching, and have such things as\r\nwe could get along without, packed in boxes. It was raining as we were\r\ngetting ready for another start. Horace Newbury of our company died\r\nlast night and we laid him to rest this morning under a beautiful\r\nmagnolia tree.\r\n\r\nMarch 24th. In the forenoon we worked on our guns and in the afternoon\r\nwe had inspection and dress-parade.\r\n\r\nMarch 25th. I was detailed to go on picket duty this morning.\r\nLieutenant Gorman was officer of the picket. The night was cool and\r\nclear and everything was quiet all along the lines.\r\n\r\nMarch 26th. A beautiful morning with the birds singing merrily. I got\r\ninto camp about eleven o'clock. We had orders about nine o'clock in the\r\nevening to be ready for marching. It was very rainy weather and there\r\nwas very little done in camp.\r\n\r\nMarch 27th. We had orders to march and all was packing and confusion. I\r\nwas ordered to help put our tents and baggage aboard the boat, the St.\r\nMary. We had all our things aboard this little craft about five o'clock\r\nin the afternoon. At last, after being over a week packing up, waiting\r\nfor orders, we were on the move. We left Baton Rouge at five o'clock\r\nand reached this place at nine, (as luck would have it) in a\r\nrain-storm. Lay on the ground under the trees all night.\r\n\r\nMarch 28th. We just received marching orders again. Where we were going\r\nto nobody seemed to know. I supposed our destination was Brashear City\r\nand Burwick Bay, but beyond that nothing was known. Rumor said, Texas\r\nand Red River. We took tents and all our baggage and did not expect\r\nagain to see Baton Rouge.\r\n\r\nSunday morning, March 29th. Arrived in Donaldsonville about nine\r\no'clock last evening. Slept on the ground all night. In the morning had\r\nsome hard-tack and coffee. We received a mail. I got several letters,\r\none was from mother. I went to a Catholic meeting. Donaldsonville is an\r\nexceedingly pretty place, very old-fashioned, shingled-roofed town. A\r\nbayou extends through the center, some three hundred yards wide; it\r\nruns to the gulf and is so deep that a frigate lies in it about a mile\r\nfrom where it sets in from the Mississippi. The catalpa and China-bell\r\ntrees were in full blossom and the pecans were leafing out. There was a\r\nCatholic church here that looked like a barn outside but quite pretty\r\ninside, as I saw for myself, and thither the people who were mostly\r\nFrench and Spanish, were flocking. We here enjoyed the luxury of seeing\r\nladies, in clean white petticoats, walking the streets. And really we\r\nhad to laugh, for actually those petticoats were the most home-like\r\nthings we had seen for some months. \"Billy\" Wilson's Zouaves, who were\r\nin our division, were placed under arrest and had their arms taken from\r\nthem. They got very drunk coming down on the boat and mutinied.\r\n\r\nMarch 30th. You can't imagine how beautiful the flowers were looking.\r\nCherokee roses, jessamines, jonquils, and a great variety of flowers\r\nwere in blossom. We lived out under the trees with the rain pattering\r\nupon us. We were greatly bothered with vermin, which it is almost\r\nimpossible to pick off. Campaigning evidently agreed with me, for I had\r\ngained several pounds since leaving New York.\r\n\r\nApril 1st. We were on the march very early. Our brigade went ahead as\r\nskirmishers. We went through a very pleasant country. We started about\r\nseven o'clock on the morning of April 2nd. Our company was guard of the\r\nbaggage train. We went through a place called Thibodeaux, a very pretty\r\nvillage. We stopped \"a right smart way,\" from Thibodeaux, as the\r\ncontrabands used to tell us when we inquired the distance of them. We\r\nwere there only a short time, when we were crowded on to some freight\r\ncars like cattle and transported to Bayou Boeuf, arriving at ten\r\no'clock at night, pretty well fagged out.\r\n\r\nWe had some awfully hot and fatiguing marches and the boys were very\r\nfoot-sore. I held out wonderfully; did not so much as raise a sign of a\r\nblister, though carrying a rubber blanket, a heavy overcoat, canteen\r\nfull of water, haversack, with two days' rations in it,--by no means a\r\nsmall load as I found after a few miles' march. My nose and cheeks\r\nunderwent a skinning operation on our Port Hudson expedition and I felt\r\nquite badly when I found that they were again peeling.\r\n\r\nApril 3rd. We have fixed up our shelter tents, and I helped unload our\r\nbaggage. The day was pleasant but Bayou Boeuf was a very unpleasant\r\nplace. A comrade came into our camp from the Twelfth Regiment, C.V.\r\nHis name was Wells Hubbard of Glastonbury, Conn.\r\n\r\nApril 5th, Sunday. On camp guard I was stationed in front of General\r\nGrover's headquarters for the night. During the day we crossed over the\r\nBayou Lefourche to the main part of the town and spent some time in\r\nexploring it. It must have been an exceedingly beautiful place before\r\nthe bombardment a short time before. Many of the houses were lying in\r\nruins. Then there was a very pretty cemetery embowered in red and white\r\nroses which hung in clusters over the monuments. I saw on some of the\r\ngraves fresh wreaths of roses and pinks and on many pictures were\r\nhanging showing the weeping survivors beneath a weeping willow. Blue\r\npinks seemed to be a favorite flower and were planted around a great\r\nmany of the graves. There were some old tombstones at that place. On\r\none was the following inscription:\r\n\r\n    \"Affliction sore, long time I bore;\r\n      Physicians were in vain,\r\n    Till God did please, that death should come,\r\n      And ease me of my pain.\"\r\n\r\nAgain we were all packed up and on the move at about 8 A.M. The road,\r\nin fact all the way to Thibodeaux, lay along the Bayou Lefourche, a\r\nclear and cool stream, on which our steamers were passing bearing the\r\nsick and baggage. As we wound along under the catalpa and China-ball\r\ntrees, the people were out on the piazzas watching us; this seemed to\r\nbe their occupation almost everywhere. Such a slovenly set you never\r\nsaw,--the women with frizzled hair and slipshod shoes. They were\r\nevidently very poor. But, oh, the fine clover fields we passed. The\r\nheart of a cow would have leaped with joy at the sight; and it was just\r\nso all the way to Thibodeaux. It must have been a splendid farming\r\ncountry. Sugar cane and cotton fields were also looking fine. After\r\nmarching about twelve miles we encamped at Paincourtville, pretty well\r\ntired out. There were plenty of chickens, pigs, and sheep running loose\r\nof which we were not slow to avail ourselves. About the last thing I\r\nsaw when I had lain down for the night was a porker squealing for all\r\nhe was worth and charging blindly among the camp-fires over bunks and\r\nslumbering soldiers pursued by a band of shouting men discharging all\r\nkinds of deadly missiles at him.\r\n\r\nApril 7th. We were off at 7 A.M. Still among clover fields. On our\r\nmarch we passed some beautiful plantations; one was especially so. It\r\nwas perfectly embowered in trees, had a smooth-cut lawn. There was a\r\nfountain and some swans swimming in the pond in front of the house. On\r\nthe veranda there were two ladies working and some little children were\r\nplaying. It was the prettiest sight I had seen in Louisiana. It fairly\r\nstilled the boys, seeing those children, and I heard more than one\r\ntough fellow sing out \"God bless them.\" At another little white cottage\r\nwe saw a lady whose husband had fallen in the army. She sent her slaves\r\nout where we were with pails of cool water. It was a simple act but we\r\ncould not help blessing her for it.\r\n\r\nAnd then we resumed our dusty way. The heat and dust were very intense;\r\nnot a breath of air was stirring. We marched fourteen miles to\r\nLabadieville, and camped for the night on a sugar plantation, where we\r\njust had sugar and molasses to our hearts' content. Early the next\r\nmorning we started in a flood of moonlight that silvered the grass with\r\ndew-drops. There is something very fascinating in camping-out; the\r\ncamp-fires far and wide, the hum and bustle everywhere. It makes one\r\nforget his troubles.\r\n\r\nApril 9th. We had marching orders this morning. We marched as far as\r\nBrashear City, and camped for the night. It was the hardest day's march\r\nof all. The men staggered over the road from fatigue and sore feet. We\r\nfelt better when we passed from the road into the clover field to lie\r\ndown. At 6 P.M. came the order to fall in and we were ordered on board\r\nthe little steamer, St. Mary. We stayed there all night,--expecting to\r\nstart every minute.\r\n\r\nApril 11th. Although it was a small boat, the Fifty-second\r\nMassachusetts, the Twenty-fourth and Twenty-fifth Connecticut, and a\r\nbattery with horses, were just packed on board. Just imagine how we\r\nmust have been crowded together.\r\n\r\nApril 12th. We steamed out of the bay at 9 o'clock, the Clifton\r\nflagship ahead, then the Calhoun, Arizona, Laurel Hill, and St. Mary,\r\nalso several tugs. We were now under convoy of these gunboats; they\r\nwere to pilot us up through the chain of lakes from Burwick Bay into\r\nGrand Lake, where we arrived about 12 o'clock. It was an extremely hot\r\nday for so many to be crowded together, and we slept but little.\r\n\r\nApril 13th. We went ashore at one o'clock. There was some firing on our\r\npicket line at night. I was detailed to go back to the lake and help\r\nbring up some rations where our forces were stationed. There was a\r\nheavy thunder shower and we slept but little all night.\r\n\r\nI want to say here that we landed our forces, after sending out a party\r\nto reconnoitre under cover of the Calhoun, which shelled the woods\r\nwhile we came ashore. Our object was to cut off the retreat of the\r\nConfederates while Emory's and Sherman's division crossed Burwick Bay\r\nto attack them.\r\n\r\nApril 14th. On this date came the hard-fought battle of Irish Bend. We\r\nstarted out at daylight as skirmishers without any breakfast. When we\r\nhad gone about a mile, brisk firing commenced on both sides. We\r\nadvanced very fast, loading and firing as we went. When we had advanced\r\nvery near the Rebel batteries and supposed that everything was going\r\nwell, we were flanked by the enemy. We were immediately ordered to fall\r\nback a short distance. The Thirteenth Connecticut took our places soon\r\nin solid column, when the tune changed and the Confederates retreated\r\ninto the woods, whence they came. When our brigade got together and\r\nformed in line of battle, we were again ordered to the front, where the\r\nRebels sent shells into our ranks from their gunboat Diana. They burned\r\nher about two o'clock and retreated.\r\n\r\nApril 15th. This morning I thought I must write a little in my diary. I\r\nthink it was through the mercy of God that my life was spared through\r\nthe previous day's fight. It seemed a miracle that one came out alive.\r\nI felt very thankful that I was able to come out of the Battle of Irish\r\nBend without a scratch, after hearing the horrible results. Our\r\nregiment suffered severely. For about two hours we were under a hot\r\nfire entirely unsupported. We went into the fight with 380 men and lost\r\n83 killed and wounded and 14 missing. Our third brigade was about the\r\nonly one engaged and we lost in that short space of time over 300 men\r\nkilled, wounded and missing. Colonel Birge had his horse shot from\r\nunder him. We had two officers killed and four wounded. It seems almost\r\na miracle, when I think of it at this time, that so many escaped\r\nwithout a mark. We started on the march on the morning of April 15,\r\nabout nine o'clock pursuing the Rebels very closely through the day. It\r\nwas a fine rich country that we passed through; the cane and cotton\r\nfields were looking finely. We went into camp at night near a sugar\r\nmill that had a quantity of sugar in it, to which we helped ourselves.\r\nThere was considerable firing through the day.\r\n\r\nA more detailed account of the Battle of Irish Bend is here given by\r\nMajor Thomas McManus of the Twenty-fifth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF IRISH BEND.\r\n\r\nInteresting Reminiscences of Terrible Conflict Between States.\r\n\r\nHorrors of War Graphically Told by General Thomas McManus, Who Was\r\nMajor of the Twenty-fifth Regiment, Connecticut Volunteers.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy request of Major Thomas McManus I will give a brief account of the\r\ncountry of lower Louisiana and the battle of Irish Bend, as given by\r\nhim in an address at St. Patrick's Church, Collinsville, April 23,\r\n1893, and published in the Hartford Post of the date of April 14, 1913,\r\nbeing fifty years to a day after that terrible conflict:\r\n\r\nLower Louisiana is a marshy, swampy level stretch of country with an\r\nimperceptible coast line. No one can tell where the solid ground ends\r\nor where the sea begins. Approaching from the Gulf of Mexico, you find\r\nyour ship in muddy waters, and by and by you see here and there a speck\r\nof mud itself, emerging above the surface, and barely large enough to\r\nbe noticed, and after a while these small islands grow together and you\r\nbegin to realize that there are distinctly defined banks each side of\r\nthe broad muddy channel through which you are sailing, intersected here\r\nand there by other channels extending in every direction. Twenty miles\r\nperhaps from the place where you first perceived indications of real\r\nmud, the land will be firm enough to sustain a few piles supporting a\r\nfisherman's cabin or pilot's hut. Ten miles further on and you may see\r\nsigns of life and cultivation. The river banks have risen to a height\r\nof two or three feet above the level of the water. The whole\r\nsouthwestern part of the state is a network of bayous or natural\r\ncanals, usually narrow and always deep. In summer they are mere\r\nchannels of drainage, but in spring they are full to the top and often\r\noverflowing thus making a system of natural waterways that reach within\r\na mile or two of every plantation with currents strong enough to carry\r\nthe flat boats laden with sugar, cotton and corn to New Orleans,\r\nBrashear or the ports on the coast. Here and there the yet unfilled\r\ndepressions in the soil form large but shallow lakes, that in the dry\r\nseason are mere marshes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAJOR THOMAS M'MANUS\r\n               Hartford, Conn.\r\n               Major of 25th Regiment, Connecticut Volunteers.]\r\n\r\nThis was the region where it was fated that the Twenty-fifth\r\nConnecticut regiment should make its spring campaign in 1863. Early in\r\nDecember we had taken possession of Baton Rouge on the Mississippi and\r\nhad employed our time in practically learning the art of war, and we\r\nprided ourselves on our proficiency in drill and discipline. The winter\r\nhad been, to us who were accustomed to our rigorous climate here, very\r\nmild, but we had begun to feel as early as the end of March, a\r\nforetaste of that terrible enervation that the coming summer was to\r\nbring to our men habituated to our bracing air of Connecticut. We were\r\nsomewhat hardened to the little outdoor inconveniences of Louisiana. We\r\ndidn't mind the mosquitoes, although they were ten times as big--a\r\nhundred times as hungry and a thousand times as vicious as those we\r\nraise here. We didn't mind the wood-ticks, and although we preferred\r\nnot to have moccasin snakes in our tents, they would come sometimes. We\r\nhad made a movement on Port Hudson early in March and the Twenty-fifth\r\nwas in the lead, seven miles in advance of the main army. We had built\r\na bridge over the Bayou Montecino, and had lain on our arms all night\r\nawaiting orders to attack Port Hudson, when Farragut's fleet attempted\r\nto pass the batteries. Only two of his ships, the Hartford and\r\nAlbatross, succeeded, while the Richmond was disabled and the\r\nMississippi was destroyed. We had engaged in a night skirmish with the\r\nenemy at Montecino, and had lost one man in that affair. We had retired\r\nfrom Port Hudson as rear guard to the column. Ours was the post of\r\ndanger every time, and we had encountered the worst storm and waded\r\nthrough the deepest mud to be found on the continent and had bivouacked\r\nin a field almost as dry as the bottom of Lake Ontario.\r\n\r\nWith these experiences we felt like veterans, but we didn't then know\r\nhow much we had to learn. On March 31, our regiment was transported to\r\nDonaldsonville, fifty miles below Baton Rouge, from there we marched\r\nbeside Bayou Lefourche to Thibodeaux and then took the cars for Bayou\r\nBoeuf, and after a few days' halt, marched over to Brashear. We knew\r\nthat something was going to be done, but didn't know what. We knew that\r\nsomebody was going to be hurt, but didn't know who. We knew that some\r\nfolks were going to get badly whipped, but it wasn't us. We were\r\ncertain of that. Our superior officer and officers couldn't tell us\r\nanything or wouldn't tell us anything, and I have since come to the\r\nconclusion that they were very much like some of the wire pulling\r\npoliticians of the present day. They didn't know themselves. It may be\r\nwisdom sometimes in war and in politics, not to let your followers know\r\njust what you intend to make them do, but it's mighty poor policy to\r\nlet your enemy know it first.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, April 11, 1863, the Twenty-fifth Connecticut, less than\r\n500 strong, embarked on the steamer St. Mary, a New York and Galveston\r\nliner built to carry 500 passengers at a pinch, but loaded on this\r\noccasion with 2,500.\r\n\r\nWe were crowded. We were just packed as close as the squares of\r\nhardtack in the bread barrels, closer than sardines in a box. So close\r\nthat we didn't have room to sweat. We had to hold our haversacks that\r\ncontained three days' rations of sheet iron biscuit and salt pork, on\r\nour heads. The decks were covered with a solid mass of humanity. We\r\ncast off the lines and our ship slowly steamed up the Atchafalaya, now\r\nand then rubbing the banks so closely that we could grasp the branches\r\nof the magnolia and cypress that formed one green, unbroken fringe on\r\neither side.\r\n\r\nGeneral Emory's division of Banks' army had already moved up the west\r\nbank of the Bayou Teche, fighting its way against the fresh active\r\ntroops of Dick Taylor. We were in General Cuvier Grover's division, and\r\nwere expected to sail up Grand Lake and disembark at Hutchins Landing,\r\nwhere the Teche, by a sharp bend, comes within two miles of the lake;\r\nand on this narrow strip was the only road (as we supposed) over which\r\nan army and especially artillery and baggage wagons could pass. During\r\nSaturday night, Sunday, and Sunday night we were crammed, stifled and\r\nsuffocated on the steamer's deck, as she slowly felt her way up through\r\nthe muddy and shallow water of Grand Lake. To have run aground would\r\nhave been disastrous failure to the whole expedition. Towing astern\r\nwere large flat bottomed scows, loaded with artillery and artillery\r\nmen. These were indispensable when on Monday morning we found that it\r\nwas impossible for our ship to approach within half a mile of the\r\nshore, and the men were ferried from the steamer to the bank, where a\r\nlively little skirmish was going on between some Confederate scouts and\r\nCol. Dick Holcomb's First Louisiana. General Grover was ahead of us,\r\nsmoking as usual, and in his excitement he had lighted a second cigar\r\nand was vigorously puffing and pulling at both corners of his mouth. He\r\ngrasped Colonel Bissell by the hands in welcome, as the colonel leaped\r\nfrom the boat. No delay now, forward! A few hundred yards brought us to\r\nthe woods. Our skirmishers went through and we soon had orders to\r\nfollow. We halted at the open clearing on the other side and awaited to\r\nhear from General Grover, who had gone ahead to reconnoitre. Off to the\r\nsouthwest we could hear the artillery firing that told us that Emory's\r\nforces were having a fierce fight with Taylor's, only a few miles away.\r\nAnother half mile advance, another halt and again forward. Just as the\r\nsun was going down we crossed the Teche over a drawbridge and filed\r\ninto the main road and skirted the fertile plantation of Madame Porter.\r\nThis stately, handsome lady, surrounded by scores of fat, happy looking\r\nand well clad slaves, stood in front of her elegant home and sadly\r\nwatched us as we passed. No farm in Connecticut, however carefully\r\nsupervised, could show better evidences of wise management than this.\r\nThe houses, fences, granaries, fields, slave quarters and everything,\r\nwere in perfect order--all were clean, whole, and systematically\r\narranged. The fertile soil seemed to proclaim audibly to our farmer\r\nboys its readiness to give back a hundred and fifty fold for its seed\r\nand care. The shades of night were falling fast when we filed into an\r\nopen ploughed field and moved by the right of companies to the rear\r\ninto columns. We halted, stacked arms, ate hardtack and raw pork, and\r\nrested. The ground was soft alluvial; mist came with sundown and rain\r\ncame with the darkness, and the surface of the earth was soon\r\ntransformed into soft, deep mud. There was no noise, no music, no\r\nlaughter. Every man knew instinctively that the morrow's sun would\r\nshine upon many a corpse. Our generals had believed, and we had hoped,\r\nthat as soon as Taylor would find this large force of ours suddenly\r\noccupying the road in his rear, he would submit to the inevitable and\r\nsurrender, but he had not surrendered and would not surrender, and that\r\nmeant a fierce engagement for us. As soon as darkness had set in,\r\nGeneral Grover sent up rockets to apprise General Banks of our\r\nposition. Sleep was impossible. Colonel Bissell and I sat on a bread\r\nbox, back to back, our feet in the soft mud and our clothing gradually\r\nabsorbing the rain that fell steadily upon us. The hours dragged slowly\r\nalong, and before daybreak our men were aroused, made a hasty\r\nbreakfast, and in the grey of the morning we set out in advance of our\r\nbrigade that consisted of the Thirteenth and Twenty-fifth Connecticut,\r\nTwenty-sixth Maine and One Hundred and Fifty-ninth New York, Colonel\r\nBirge in command. We were all on foot, officers and men alike. Our\r\nhorses, baggage, and impediments had been left at Brashear to follow\r\nthe column of General Emory.\r\n\r\nFor a mile below Madame Porter's plantation the Bayou Teche runs to the\r\nsoutheast and then turns sharply to the southwest towards Franklin, a\r\nvery pretty village, some five miles below. The road following the\r\nsinuosities of the stream runs parallel to it, with a strip of a few\r\nrods in width between. We enter an immense cane field, its furrows in\r\nline with the road. On the west the field was bounded by a rail fence,\r\nbeyond which arose a dense wood of magnolias, cotton wood and\r\nsemi-tropical trees looking like a long green wall. Far in front arose\r\na transverse wall like to the first, and making at its intersection a\r\nright angle. At this angle, the road entered the wood, near to the\r\nground this forest was absolutely impenetrable to the sight, by reason\r\nof the suffocating growth of briars, vines, palmettos and underbrush.\r\nWe ought to have occupied these woods the night before, and have hemmed\r\nthe enemy in the open beyond. We now knew that the foe was in our\r\nimmediate front. We marched down the field, the right wing deployed as\r\nskirmishers, the left wing in close battalion front following a few\r\nrods in its rear. By and by a puff of smoke from the green wall in\r\nfront of us and a second or two afterwards the crack of a rifle. The\r\nfight had begun; another puff, another crack then more and more,\r\nmultiplying as we approached. The bend in the road is now disclosed,\r\nthe enemy's skirmishers disappeared from our front to reappear in\r\ngreater numbers on our right. Our skirmishers were called in and we\r\nchanged front forward on first company, moved down towards the wood on\r\nthe right, and halting about 150 yards from the fence, we poured a\r\nvolley into the enemy's ranks. The One Hundred and Fifty-ninth New York\r\ncame down into line on our left, the Twenty-sixth Maine formed in our\r\nrear, the Thirteenth Connecticut took position on our extreme left\r\noccupying both sides of the road. The canes of the previous year's\r\nsugar crop stood in the field and their volley firing didn't get our\r\nrange, and our lines were parallel with the furrows. The enemy's shot\r\nrattled through the dry stalks, crackling like hail against the\r\nwindows. The enemy were armed with the smooth bores, every cartridge\r\ncharged with a bullet and three buck shot, while our regiment was armed\r\nwith Enfield rifles and so the Rebels, man for man were giving us four\r\nshots to our one in return.\r\n\r\nThe enemy had an immense advantage in position and the conviction was\r\nstealing over us that they had the advantage in numbers also. Our men\r\nhad warmed up to their work; every soldier had long before drained the\r\nlast drop from his canteen; the sun was rising high and hot and we\r\nlearned then that there is no thirst so burning and terrible as that\r\nwhich seizes upon the soldier in battle. Every command given by the\r\nConfederate officers was as distinctly heard by us as if given in our\r\nown companies. Their lines already extended far beyond our flank and\r\ntheir oft-repeated cheers told us how rapidly their ranks were being\r\nincreased by new arrivals. Suddenly a loud cheer from the Rebels; then\r\nthe thundering war of a field piece, and in an instant from overhead\r\ncame a crack, with a rain of iron fragments as a shell exploded right\r\nover our line; another roar, a crack, and iron shower and we see to our\r\ndismay two brazen guns admirably served, trained directly upon us\r\npouring shell grape and cannister into our ranks, while their musketry\r\nfire grew hotter and fiercer than ever. Our men were nearing the end of\r\ntheir supply of ammunition. If the Confederates had charged upon us at\r\nthis time they would have annihilated our brigade!\r\n\r\nWounded men were crawling to the rear, where Dr. Wood, with McGill and\r\nhis assistants, stood under their yellow hospital flag. Col. Bissell's\r\nvoice rang clear and cheerful as ever, but his face was anxious. Down\r\ninto the field came Bradley's battery at a gallop and very soon their\r\nguns were answering the enemy's. Up went Bissell's sword, with a joyful\r\ncheer, as he shouted to Lieutenant Dewey \"There's music in the air!\"\r\nOur re-enforcements of artillery gave us renewed spirits but it was in\r\nvain to hope for victory against a better posted and overwhelming\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nHurrah! At last, here comes Dwight's brigade. But suddenly, as if\r\nevoked by magic, arose a long gray line of armed men. They had crawled\r\nunperceived through the thick high canes and our first intimation of\r\ntheir presence was a murderous volley raking our lines from right to\r\nleft. Bradley's battery was retreating to the rear, with nine of his\r\nmen dead or disabled on the ground. \"Fall back!\" shouted the Colonel.\r\nOur right wing was in confusion and disorder. The left wing fell back\r\nsteadily but only for a few rods, the advancing brigade opened ranks to\r\nlet us pass and we halted and we formed in its rear and sank exhausted\r\non the ground anxiously watching the fate of our gallant supporters.\r\nNinety-five of our brave boys were dead or wounded, nine-tenths of them\r\nby that terrible flank fire. In our last five minutes on the field lay\r\nthe lifeless bodies of Captain Hayden and young Lieutenant Dewey.\r\nArnold and Wilson lay dead. Lieutenant Oliver had been carried from the\r\nfield with a bullet in his head, to linger for six weeks before death\r\ncame to his relief. Lieutenant Waterman stood resolute at the head of\r\nhis company with his arm bandaged and bleeding. Lieutenant Harkness\r\nlimped painfully along disabled by a spent bullet. John H. Hunt of\r\nCoventry had his side torn open by an explosion, and his sufferings\r\nwere intense. It was strange that he didn't die instantly, yet he\r\nlingered for seven days. John Martin fell dead at the final volley from\r\nthe Rebels. Old Button was carried off the field, his shoulder mangled,\r\nthe bone splintered in the socket and with but a few days more of life\r\nbefore him. Graham lay dead. Brooks, the tall young sapling whose\r\nextraordinary height made him a conspicuous mark, had fallen pierced by\r\na dozen bullets. Sergeant Taft, with a shattered arm, was carried off\r\nthe field by his lieutenant. Brennan, Gray, Prindle, Lawton, Holden and\r\nCarlos Bissell lay dead. Cook lay mortally wounded. Lieutenant Banning\r\nwas crippled for life. John Thompson of Ellington had a bullet hole\r\nthrough his jaws, incapacitating him for further service. Goodwin,\r\nLincoln, and Avery Brown were also seriously injured in this battle, as\r\nwere also many others whom I cannot name.\r\n\r\n                    *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nApril 16th. We started at seven o'clock, marching quite slowly through\r\nthe day. We were on the way to Newton or New Iberia, distance about 35\r\nmiles from Irish Bend,--where the battle took place. It was very hot\r\nand dusty and the men were getting very foot sore; a good many had to\r\nfall out by the road-side to rest. We had formed a junction with\r\nEmory's division and Weitzel's brigade and were at this time in close\r\npursuit of the enemy, seven miles from New Iberia. We had taken a large\r\nnumber of prisoners, three pieces of artillery and several caissons and\r\nthe Confederates fearful of the gunboats Diana and the Queen of the\r\nWest falling into our hands burned them. In addition to this the\r\nArizona engaged and blew up a Rebel gunboat. We were in hot pursuit of\r\nthe Rebels, our advance skirmishing with Rebel General Moulton's rear\r\nguard.\r\n\r\nApril 17th. We were up at three o'clock, and started soon after getting\r\nsome hard-tack and coffee. Our division was alone, Emory's division\r\nhaving taken a different route. We made a hard march of twenty miles. A\r\ngreat many men fell out, but we pushed the Rebels hard. At 5 P.M. they\r\nmade a stand and an artillery duel ensued in which we lost a few men.\r\nThe Confederates then retired, burning the bridge over the bayou. We\r\nthen halted for the night, supposing that our next move would be\r\nAlexandra, via Opelousas, which since the capture of Baton Rouge had\r\nbeen the capital of the state of Louisiana.\r\n\r\nApril 19th, Sunday. This morning we had a hard thunder shower, arousing\r\nus from our bunks and soaking us thoroughly. We started on the march at\r\neight o'clock. It was very muddy and we had to march very slow on that\r\naccount. We went into camp at night pretty well fagged out. About\r\nmidnight I was called up to go out quite a distance to an out-post on\r\npicket. We had a very hard time of it, for we had to be up until\r\nmorning and stand by our arms.\r\n\r\nApril 20th. We marched rather slow on account of it being so\r\nexcessively hot. We forded quite a bayou where the Rebels had burned\r\nanother bridge. We went into camp at night at Opelousas, where we\r\nexpected to have a fight but on our approach, we found the Rebels had\r\nretreated from the town, which was pretty good news for us.\r\n\r\nOpelousas, April 21st. I will endeavor to give a few of my experiences\r\nat this place. Here General Banks gave his worn and tired army a rest.\r\nThe Twenty-fifth Connecticut took position about seven miles east of\r\nheadquarters, at Barre's Landing. While we privates were enjoying a\r\nsuspension of active operations, the officers were unusually busy, as\r\ntheir numbers were greatly reduced by resignation, sickness and death.\r\nWe were still wondering why that long looked for paymaster had not\r\nblessed us with his appearance and we were still in despair about it.\r\nSince the battle of Irish Bend we pressed the Confederates hard all the\r\nway to Opelousas, fighting their rear guard and taking prisoners every\r\nday. Our cavalry made a fierce charge at New Iberia. With sabers drawn\r\nthey charged into the Texicans, scattering them in every direction. We\r\nwere then at the port of Opelousas and shipping cotton at a great rate.\r\nWe had shipped some two thousand bales; there was still a large\r\nquantity at the landing and more coming in hourly. We had to all take\r\nhold and help load it on the boat. While we were out on picket one day\r\nwe had the good luck to come across one hundred and thirty bales.\r\nOpelousas was a very pleasant little city of several thousand\r\ninhabitants. There were some splendid mansions with grounds laid out in\r\nfine style. There was a small foundry in the place and two magazines;\r\none of its three churches was stored with powder and ammunition,\r\nabandoned by the Confederates in their flight. The people were more\r\nUnion than any we had previously seen and were of a better class.\r\nProvisions were sold at fabulous prices; eggs fifty cents a dozen,\r\ncoffee five dollars a pound, and flour fifty dollars a barrel, and\r\nscarcely any at that. We learned from some of our Rebel prisoners how\r\ntheir soldiers lived. They had only one commissary wagon drawn by three\r\nyoke of oxen for an army of five thousand men. They lived principally\r\nupon the plantations as they passed along, as we had done.\r\n\r\nThe slaves appeared to me, all the way through this long march, to be\r\ncontented and happy with their families in their cabins. I think they\r\nlived principally on corn which they ground by hand power and made into\r\ncorn bread and hoe cake, with plenty of sweet potatoes which grew\r\nabundantly in Louisiana. I think they must have gotten along pretty\r\nwell. At many plantations where the Union soldiers would stop at\r\nnightfall for chickens, the slaves would come out of their cabins and\r\nplead with us to let them be. This, our boys were very loath to do, and\r\nI don't know as anyone could blame them, for a good chicken was a great\r\ntemptation after a long hard day's march.\r\n\r\nMay 5th. We started on our return march this morning very early. We\r\ncame through a little village by the name of Washington. We marched\r\ntwenty miles and went into camp for the night very tired and some very\r\nfoot-sore. I was sick all day but managed to keep up with the regiment.\r\nIt was very hot and dry.\r\n\r\nMay 7th. This morning I was sick and got a pass from Doctor Wood, our\r\narmy surgeon, to go on to the ambulance wagon. But found on\r\ninvestigation that there was no room for me, as the wagons were full of\r\nsick men unable to sit up. Therefore I was obliged to ride on a baggage\r\nwagon all day. Went into camp at night feeling some better. Went out\r\nwith other comrades and bought some chickens of the darkies. About this\r\ntime the paymaster arrived. It was a time of great interest to the men,\r\nas we had not been paid for more than four months. A great many wanted\r\nto send money to their families and friends who, in some cases were in\r\ngreat need. But we were about two hundred miles from New Orleans, the\r\nnearest point from which money could be sent with safety. There were no\r\nConfederates in arms between us and New Orleans but the country was\r\nfull of men who had broken all laws and who held any human life very\r\ncheap, when money was at stake. How to send home the money the soldiers\r\ncould spare was a very important question. In a chapter printed\r\nelsewhere in this book, entitled \"How the Pay of the Regiment was\r\nCarried to New Orleans by Lieutenant Henry Hill Goodell,\" it will be\r\ntold how it was accomplished.\r\n\r\nOn May 21st we received marching orders and about noon we embarked on\r\nboard the little steamer Empire Parish along with the One Hundred and\r\nFifty-ninth New York and the Thirteenth Connecticut. I wonder if anyone\r\ncan imagine how crowded we were, also taking into consideration that a\r\ngood many of the soldiers were inclined to be troublesome. Colonel\r\nBissell was taken quite sick at about this time and had to find a place\r\nto lie down. Soon after 3 P.M., while the rest of the boats were being\r\nloaded we shipped from the dock and away up the Atchafalaya to the Red\r\nRiver where we passed the Switzerland and another little boat watching\r\nfor Rebel craft. Here we slipped down the Red River to the Mississippi,\r\nwhere we came upon the grim old Hartford, Rear Admiral Farragut's\r\nflagship. The Thirteenth Connecticut band saluted her as we passed,\r\nwith \"The Star Spangled Banner\" and \"Yankee Doodle.\" At about midnight\r\nwe went ashore at Bayou Sara, sixteen miles from Port Hudson. A portion\r\nof our brigade marched on and left our regiment to unload the boats. It\r\nwas after 2 A.M. before we had any chance to lie down.\r\n\r\nMay 22nd, at about four o'clock, we started, breakfastless, to overtake\r\nthe rest of our brigade. Colonel Bissell was left at a house with a\r\nguard. Major McManus assumed command of the regiment. We marched a\r\nshort distance and found the remainder of our brigade encamped at St.\r\nFrancisville, which was upon a hill the first we had seen since coming\r\nto Louisiana. Soon after eight o'clock our column was set in motion,\r\nthe Third brigade in advance. As we passed through the village of St.\r\nFrancisville the people thronged to the doors. Some would curse and\r\nswear, while others seemed glad to see us. One woman in a spiteful tone\r\ncalled out to another woman: \"Come in, for God's sake, and don't stay\r\nthere looking at those Yankee devils.\" The manners of these Southern\r\nwomen were astonishing. They would curse and call us vile names and\r\ncall upon God to save a just cause. We had a hard march climbing up\r\nhill between magnificent hedges of jessamine in bloom, the flowers of\r\nwhich were very beautiful. We advanced very slowly for it was quite\r\nwarm and the dust was stifling. To add to all this it was a terrible\r\ncountry to skirmish through. We had two men seriously wounded during\r\nthat day. At about 4 o'clock we halted and our regiment was ordered to\r\nthe front as advance picket for the night. We deployed into a field\r\nnear a beautiful creek,--Thompson's,--where the water was knee-deep and\r\nvery clear. Our forces were ordered across the creek to the edge of the\r\nadjoining woods. After a short skirmish we succeeded in accomplishing\r\nour object. It rained quite hard and we had to be upon the watch most\r\nof the night.\r\n\r\nMay 23rd. We started on the march, our men pretty well tired out by two\r\nnights' duty. But we had no mercy shown us. The Twenty-fifth regiment\r\nwas ordered to take the advance as skirmishers and a hard time we had\r\nof it, forcing our way through bamboo brake, pushing over vine and\r\nbushes, wading through water, scratching and tearing ourselves with\r\nthorns and stumbling over ploughed fields. It was very hard work and\r\nmany a strong man gave out with fatigue and exhaustion. At 10 o'clock\r\nA.M. we met the advance of Colonel Grierson's cavalry. Our wearied\r\ncolumn of soldiers were called in, therefore we were very much pleased\r\nto see them. We advanced a short distance and halted near a well of\r\ndelicious cool water, some two miles from Port Hudson. In a few\r\nminutes, General Augur rode up and held a conference with General\r\nGrover.\r\n\r\nAt 7 P.M. I was detailed to go on picket. Rather rough on a fellow to\r\nbe two days and nights on duty. But a soldier's first duty is to obey\r\nwithout grumbling and so I went, but I could hardly keep from going to\r\nsleep. It was a beautiful moonlight night and I stood and watched the\r\nbombs from the mortar boats curling around in the sky and bursting in a\r\nfiery show, making a splendid sight. The night passed quietly, save for\r\na couple of false alarms. At about 5 o'clock A.M., Jared Wells, my old\r\ntent mate, and I went out blackberrying. In a little while we had\r\nenough for a good meal for ourselves and some for the boys in camp.\r\nThis was the 24th of May, under the guns of Port Hudson. We got back\r\ninto camp about 9 o'clock and commenced making preparations for a\r\nSunday advance on the fortifications. The Second Brigade was in advance\r\nand the Twenty-fourth Connecticut lost a few men; at about noon the\r\nfirst earthworks were taken and we deployed into the woods on our\r\nright. We lay here for two long hours while shells burst all around us,\r\nbut we were mercifully preserved, though in great danger.\r\n\r\nSoon after 4 P.M., our regiment was ordered out as picket-skirmishers\r\nand we were stationed behind trees all through the woods to keep the\r\nenemy back. On our right was the Thirteenth Connecticut and on the left\r\nwas the One Hundred and Fifty-ninth New York. This was the third night\r\nthat we had been on duty and we were pretty well tired out but it seems\r\nthey hadn't got through with the Twenty-fifth yet.\r\n\r\nMay 25th. At about 9 A.M. we were relieved and called in. As we were\r\nbeing relieved by the Twelfth Maine we had to pass over a place\r\ncommanded by the sharpshooters of the enemy. The bullets whizzed most\r\nunpleasantly near, killing one man of the Thirteenth Connecticut. We\r\nthought that after being relieved we should get some rest. But about as\r\nsoon as we got into camp we were ordered to fall in again. We marched\r\nout of the woods, over the hill and the entrenchments taken the day\r\nbefore, immediately coming under a sharp fire from the Rebel\r\nsharpshooters. We were immediately ordered to fire upon them and drive\r\nthem out. After a sharp skirmish of half an hour we drove them clear\r\nout of the woods and into their rifle-pits. We then occupied the woods,\r\nand we kept up such a sharp fire upon them that not one of the rascally\r\nRebs dared lift his head above the works. We were just in time to save\r\nthe Twelfth Maine from being flanked and cut to pieces.\r\n\r\nAbout 3 P.M. General Weitzel's brigade attacked, and after a severe\r\nfight, drove the Rebels out of the woods. While this was going on our\r\nright, we could hear the yells, hurrahs and the crackle of musketry,\r\nroar of artillery and many other concomitants of the fight, but could\r\nsee but little. Consequently we stood and fidgeted round not knowing\r\nwhen our turn might come.\r\n\r\nMay 26th. Our regiment remained on the reserve till 5 P.M., when the\r\nfour right companies were ordered to the front. We had a splendid view\r\nof an artillery duel. The work of Nim's battery was perfect. Our\r\nartillery unlimbered two or three guns and their fire was so sharp, the\r\nRebel gunners did not dare load their pieces.\r\n\r\nMay 27th. We were relieved at about 6 P.M., by the Twelfth Maine\r\nregiment, but we were almost immediately ordered out to the support of\r\nNim's battery which had just been put into position. Here we lay five\r\nor six hours while the enemy's shells burst in most unpleasant\r\nproximity. Then our regiment and the One Hundred and Fifty-ninth New\r\nYork were ordered out to the support of General Weitzel on our right.\r\nWe marched on the double-quick down through the woods, when we were\r\nordered by General Grover to advance to the front and carry the\r\nearthworks. We were informed that there were hardly any Rebels there.\r\nMajor Burt of the One Hundred and Fifty-ninth, who was in command, was\r\ntold that his regiment alone would be able to carry the works and to\r\nsend back our regiment if it wasn't needed. But we found out very soon\r\nthat our assistance would be necessary to carry the earthworks. We\r\nrushed on through the woods and down a hill, swept by the enemy's\r\nartillery. Here we turned to the right and emerged on to a plain. I\r\nshall never forget that sight. The valley was filled with felled trees,\r\nand heavy underbrush, while thick and black rolled the battle-smoke.\r\nThere was a hill on our left, strongly entrenched and from here loomed\r\nup a big gun. Just below on a little bridge was planted a stand of the\r\nStars and Stripes, the glorious old banner, and gathered around it\r\nstood a handful of brave men firing a stream of bullets upon that\r\npiece. For six long hours the gunners did not dare approach to load and\r\nthat wicked looking gun was kept silent. It was here that we had a\r\ntaste of real war in all its horrors. It was a sort of a floating\r\npanorama that passed before me, a hideous dream. There was a roaring\r\nand crashing of artillery, bursting of shells and the rattle of\r\nmuskets, with hissing and whistling of minie balls and battle-smoke\r\nlowering down upon us. There were men dropping here and there and all\r\nthe horrid experiences of war. Still we kept on; there was a short turn\r\nto the right and in single file we commenced ascending through a deep\r\nravine. Wading through water, stumbling over and under fallen trees, we\r\nfinally came to a pit about six feet deep; when we had gotten out of\r\nthat we were on the side of the hill where we had to prepare to make a\r\ncharge. It was a wicked place to charge. The nature of the ground was\r\nsuch it was impossible to form in battle line, so to make the attack in\r\nthree columns over felled trees which were cris-crossed in every shape\r\nimaginable. We waited here for a few moments with beating hearts,\r\nwaiting for the forward charge. The word came and with a terrifying\r\nyell we rose to our feet and rushed forward. It was a terrible time,\r\nwhen bounding over the last tree and crashing through some brush we\r\ncame out within a short distance of the enemy's entrenchments, and it\r\nseemed as though a thousand rifles were cracking our doom. This fire\r\nwas too deadly for men to stand against. Our brave fellows, shot down\r\nas fast as they could come up, were beaten back. Then occurred one of\r\nthose heroic deeds we sometimes read about. The colors of the One\r\nHundred and Fifty-ninth were left on the hill, their color sergeant\r\nhaving been killed. Corporal Buckley of our regiment calmly worked back\r\nin that terrific fire, picked up the dear old flag and brought it in,\r\nturned to pick up his gun and was killed. He was a noble fellow and\r\nmuch beloved in the regiment.\r\n\r\nResting here a short time, we made a second charge with the same deadly\r\nresults. Our regiment and the One Hundred and Fifty-ninth New York lost\r\n80 men killed and wounded. It was a terrible position we were in.\r\nSharpshooters on the left picking us off; sharpshooters on right giving\r\nit to us and the rifle pits in front. Here we had to stay till after 10\r\no'clock that night when the order came to fall back, which we did,\r\nbringing off our wounded. I was so tired I fell asleep and barely woke\r\nin time to get away. We had several killed and wounded in our regiment.\r\nI will say here that our little company was not entirely dissolved at\r\nthis time though reduced to less than 20 men. Our colonel we missed\r\nsadly, but earnestly hoped to welcome him back soon. Our regiment\r\nnumbered 162 men and eight officers at this time.\r\n\r\nMay 28th. There was lively firing this morning on the picket lines, but\r\nthe cannons were quiet. We were expecting reinforcements and we needed\r\nthem if we were ever to take Port Hudson. This was the seventh day of\r\nthe siege and we were pretty well fagged out. We had to fight for every\r\nfoot of ground. But we had carried the first two earthworks by storm.\r\nIt had been one continual fight since we started in but there was a\r\ncessation of hostilities for a short time, and the lull was a great\r\nrelief, for my ears had been half-deafened by the awful roar of\r\nartillery and cracking of musketry. There were three men killed and\r\nabout twenty wounded, and thirty in our regiment missing. Again in our\r\nlittle company we had several wounded, one fatally. So I think that I\r\nmust have been in great danger several times, but I felt that a kind\r\nProvidence watched over me, and brought me out safely. The regiment at\r\nthis time was under the command of Major McManus, Colonel Bissell being\r\nsick with remittent fever at Bayou Sara and the lieutenant-colonel\r\nprostrated at New Orleans. The colored regiments fought bravely and\r\nmade some splendid charges.\r\n\r\nMay 31st. There has been some firing by the infantry and artillery\r\nduring the day. About ten o'clock last night we withdrew our forces\r\nvery cautiously, bringing away all the wounded we could reach, but\r\nthere were some poor unfortunates lying up under the breastworks that\r\nit was impossible to reach. Every time we tried to get to them the Rebs\r\nwould fire on us. We threw them canteens of water but it was of little\r\nuse. We marched back and lay upon the battlefield of the preceding day.\r\n\r\nJune 1st. We marched back into the woods and were there in support of a\r\nbattery. It was very trying for us. The Rebs had a perfect range on us\r\nand several times a day they would throw those immense twelve-inch\r\nshells right into our midst. We could hear them coming for several\r\nseconds and we all stood close to the trees for protection. There must\r\nhave been a large number killed that day. The next day there was a\r\ncessation of hostilities to bury the dead. At about seven o'clock the\r\nenemy made a terrible onslaught on our right but they were repulsed\r\nwith heavy loss. We fell into our places expecting to be called into\r\naction but we were spared for once. We remained there until the 7th\r\nwhen Lieutenant-Colonel Weld came up from New Orleans and assumed\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nJune 7th. We were ordered to the front to relieve the One Hundred and\r\nFifty-ninth New York in the rifle-pits. We went out in the night as the\r\nenemy's sharpshooters rendered it very dangerous to go in the daytime.\r\nWe had rifle pits dug about two hundred yards from the rifle-pits of\r\nthe Rebs, and we had loop-holes made from which to fire. About one\r\nhundred yards back of us was planted one of our batteries and as they\r\nfired over our heads anyone might imagine what a deafening report rang\r\nin our ears. We boys got the range of the rifle-pits of \"Mr. Secesh\"\r\nopposite, perfectly, consequently they didn't dare show their heads.\r\nThough from their hiding place they annoyed us all day. After dark we\r\nusually held some conversation with the Rebs across the ravine. We\r\nwould ask them if they wanted any soft bread. If they did we would put\r\nsome in a mortar and send it over. They said they didn't care to have\r\nany sent that way and as we didn't have much to spare we didn't send\r\nany. Our bean soup and coffee and such other food as might be handy was\r\nsent out before daylight in the morning and after dark at night. We\r\nwere here in this trench or pit for three long days and nights and one\r\ncan imagine how we suffered from heat and thirst. We were relieved on\r\nthe tenth by the One Hundred and Fifty-ninth New York. We returned to\r\nour old camp-ground June 11th between 12 and 1 A.M. A general assault\r\nwas planned but owing to some misunderstanding the plan failed.\r\n\r\nJune 14th, Sunday. The day was an eventful one in the siege of Port\r\nHudson, of which the Twenty-fifth Connecticut was engaged. We were\r\nunder way at an early hour, for we formed the reserve in the attacking\r\ncolumn. Colonel Birge was in command of the reserve. We were up at 3\r\nA.M., had a little hard-tack and coffee and started under command of\r\nCaptain Naughton at 4. Suddenly we heard a terrifying yell and the\r\ncrash and roar of artillery and musketry. Soon the dead and wounded\r\nbegan to be brought in. All kinds of conflicting stories were\r\ncirculated as to the success of our brave fellows. Very soon General\r\nPayne was wounded, and Colonel H. W. Birge assumed command, we forming\r\nthe reserve. Soon we were ordered forward. On through the scene of our\r\nfirst day's fight, then down through a ravine, where a road had been\r\ncut. Here we halted at the foot of the hill where we formed in battle\r\nline and made another charge right up over the hill, exposed to a\r\nraking fire, as we went over the crest and down through the ravine\r\nbefore we could reach the breastworks. There we lost two lieutenants. A\r\nlarge number of men were killed or wounded. We arrived at the other\r\nside of the hill in great confusion. I shall never forget that horrible\r\nscene. There were parts of several regiments all mixed up together,\r\nentangled among fallen trees. But after getting straightened out, and\r\nthe line once more formed, the order to charge was countermanded and we\r\nhad to lay up there in that fearful hot sun all day. I was taken sick\r\nand had to rest for awhile but I soon got better and joined the\r\nregiment. At about 10 P.M. we were ordered down into the outer ditch of\r\nthe breastworks. We were there but a short time, when we were ordered\r\nto the right to our old position in the rifle-pits, which we reached at\r\nmidnight.\r\n\r\nGeneral Payne had been wounded in the leg in the forenoon, but we could\r\nnot get up where he was to give him any aid, consequently he had to lay\r\nthere in the burning sun till night, when he was brought away in\r\nsafety. It was a scorching hot day and a number were sunstruck, some\r\ncases proving fatal. I was exhausted and had to lie down in the shade.\r\nIt was a miserable Sunday scrape and ended like all the rest that had\r\nbeen started on a Sunday, disastrously. The loss of life was very\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\nWe were relieved at night by the Twenty-eighth Connecticut and returned\r\nonce more to our old camp-ground, where, after the whizzing of the\r\nbullets and the cracking of firearms had died away, all was still but\r\nthe groans that could be heard upon the bloody battlefield.\r\n\r\nJune 15th. The day after the second assault on Port Hudson, General\r\nBanks issued a call for volunteers \"for a storming column of a thousand\r\nmen to vindicate the Flag of the Union, and the memory of its defenders\r\nwho had fallen. Let them come forward, every officer and soldier who\r\nshares its perils and its glory shall receive a medal fit to\r\ncommemorate the first grand success of the campaign of 1863 for the\r\nfreedom of the Mississippi River. His name will be placed upon the roll\r\nof honor.\" The next day, June 16, the order was promulgated and two\r\ndays later, June 18, these \"stormers,\" as they were called, were\r\ngathered into a camp by themselves and put into training calculated to\r\npromote physical strength and endurance. By every conceivable way they\r\nprepared themselves for the work that they were expected to do. These\r\nbrave men knew that all the arrangements for their support had been\r\nmade but the expected order did not come. They had had three or four\r\ndreadful experiences in charging earthworks and yet these men were\r\nwilling to assault those same earthworks again.\r\n\r\nJune 26th. There has been considerable bombarding on account of the\r\nRebels opening some big guns but I think they are doing very little\r\ndamage. We heard today that the enemy had driven our army across the\r\nPotomac and that there was great excitement throughout the North. We\r\nhoped that the report was false. Last night I was detailed to go on\r\npicket being sent out to an outpost about a mile from the reserve. We\r\nstood by our arms most of the time during the night. There was brisk\r\nfiring on our left most of the time.\r\n\r\nJune 27th. Came in from picket. Today we have been reviewed by\r\nMajor-General Banks. He made a temperance speech to us. I think he must\r\nhave thought that we were getting to be a pretty tough set of fellows.\r\nI don't see how he could have thought that, when we couldn't get very\r\nmuch that was intoxicating, only what quinine and whiskey Uncle Sam\r\nissued to us when we came off picket duty.\r\n\r\nJuly 1st. There has been a reason for my not writing in my diary for a\r\nfew days. We had been told that no soldiers' letters could be sent\r\nNorth and I put off writing in the hope that I could record the fall of\r\nPort Hudson, that Rebel stronghold. But still the siege drags slowly\r\nalong. Our days were divided between rifle-pits and making assaults.\r\nThe Rebs hold their rifle-pits and we advance ours or remain\r\nstationary.\r\n\r\nYesterday, the colored brigade carried a hill by storm and have held\r\nit, notwithstanding the great effort made by the Rebels to regain it.\r\n\r\nSunday, July 3rd. We attacked Port Hudson at two points, but were\r\nbeaten back with great loss. The battle still rages and omnipotence\r\nstill holds the scales in equal balance. This is the 25th day of the\r\nsiege and we are still stuck outside the fortification. Last Sunday we\r\nmade a general assault. We got inside three times but for want of\r\nsupport were driven back. Men were mowed down on our right and left. It\r\nwas a wonder how I was preserved. I have been in four direct assaults\r\non the breastworks, several skirmishes and yet not a scratch have I\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nPort Hudson, July 4th, (Independence Day). As will be seen, we had no\r\nidea of what was going on more than two hundred miles up the river at\r\nVicksburg, or fifteen hundred miles at Gettysburg. At Vicksburg,\r\nGeneral Grant was quietly smoking a cigar when he wrote a dispatch to\r\nbe sent to Cairo to be telegraphed to the General-in-Chief at\r\nWashington: \"The enemy surrendered this morning. The only terms allowed\r\nis their parole as prisoners of war.\" The same dispatch was sent to\r\nGeneral Banks at Port Hudson. At Gettysburg the army of the Potomac had\r\ninflicted a terrible defeat on the army of Northern Virginia. I really\r\nbelieve this is the quietest Fourth of July I have ever spent. Verily,\r\nI don't believe there has been as much powder burnt here as in New York\r\nor Boston. I wouldn't wonder if Hartford, with its swarm of boys, could\r\noutstrip us. Every little while there's a bang, a boom and the bursting\r\nof a shell, for we must keep the besieged from falling asleep and stir\r\nthem up occasionally. Now, the music is becoming lively, the gunboats\r\nand the batteries are pitching in and altogether we are giving them\r\nHail Columbia to the tune of Yankee Doodle.\r\n\r\nFor the last few days we have been in a very enviable frame of mind,\r\nexpecting every day to be ordered to participate in another assault.\r\nYet the orders have not come and each night we have drawn a long breath\r\nand exclaimed one more day of grace. Well, so it is, but while we are\r\ngetting uneasy for another fight we have a strong desire to avoid\r\ncharging on the breastworks again. We've been in three, and some of us\r\nfour, assaults on the Rebel fortifications and each time we have been\r\ndriven back. The first of July, General Banks made us a great speech\r\npromising us that within three days we would be inside Port Hudson. But\r\nthe three days have passed and those rascally Rebs still persist in\r\nkeeping us outside. Although the fortifications could probably be\r\nstormed any day, yet why waste life when a few days will bring them to\r\nterms, as they are now reduced to mule-meat and a little corn.\r\nDeserters are coming in fast. One day as many as one hundred and fifty\r\ncame in saying they couldn't stand mule-meat any longer. Now I am\r\nfeeling sure that within a few days I shall be able to record the fall\r\nof Port Hudson. The Rebel cavalry are harassing our rear ranks\r\ncontinually. They made a dash day before yesterday from Clinton and\r\nJackson, striking here and there and picked up some stragglers and\r\nforaging parties. A few days ago they dashed into Springfield Landing\r\nwhence we draw our stores and ammunition, but our cavalry went after\r\nthem so quick they found pressing business in other quarters.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the Mississippi quite a force came down. They\r\nattacked Donaldsonville a few days ago demanding the surrender of the\r\ntown. But the provost-marshal gathered his forces together, amounting\r\nto about two hundred, got inside his fortifications, and waited for\r\nthem to come up. The contest was kept up from midnight till daylight,\r\nwhen the sudden appearance of a gunboat caused the Rebels to skedaddle,\r\nleaving about one hundred dead on the field, several hundred wounded\r\nand one hundred and twenty prisoners.\r\n\r\nNow comes the great surprise of all. The confounded Rebs have got into\r\nBayou Boeuf and destroyed or captured the whole of our division\r\nproperty stored there. Tents, baggage, knapsacks, company and\r\nregimental books are all gone. At this time we were all as poor as\r\nJob's turkey. Except for the rags that cover us, we haven't a thing.\r\nWere I where I could, I should like to write a letter to the Soldiers'\r\nAid Society for some handkerchiefs, being reduced to the last shift, i.\r\ne., the flap of an old shirt picked up in a deserted mansion. Word\r\ncomes from Colonel Bissell that he is slowly improving. We are hoping\r\nthat we shall see him with us again soon. But I really believe his\r\nsickness saved his life, for it is doubtful if he would have come out\r\nalive from the charge the regiment made on the 27th of May. We are\r\nhaving some very hot weather. We are spending most of our time on\r\npicket duty and trying to keep cool. You would have laughed if you\r\ncould have seen us at our meals wearing only shirt and drawers, while\r\nour comical colored boy, Adam, squatted down on the ground in front of\r\nus keeping the flies off. This Adam was a corker. Speaking of Mobile\r\none day, he said: \"Reckon you couldn't fool dis nigga much in dat town.\r\nSpecks he was born and raised dar. Yah! yah! yah! Reckon he knows ebry\r\nhole dar from de liquor-shops to de meeting houses.\"\r\n\r\nJuly 8th. The dispatch from General Grant, previously referred to, was\r\nreceived. The booming of big guns, the cheers and shouts of the Union\r\nsoldiers and the strains of patriotic music informed the besieged that\r\nsomething had happened. They were not slow to find out the cause of the\r\nrejoicing. General Gardner sent a flag of truce to General Banks to\r\nknow if the report that Vicksburg had surrendered was true and received\r\nin reply a copy of General Grant's dispatch. The garrison had done\r\ntheir duty with brave fortitude. The Union lines were already in some\r\nplaces up to their breastworks. Starvation was staring them in the face\r\nand taking everything into consideration about the only thing for\r\nGeneral Gardner to do was to surrender. Should the expected charge have\r\nbeen made by the \"stormers\" it would have been a waste of life for they\r\ncould not expect to hold their position.\r\n\r\nThe 8th was spent in arranging terms for the surrender of the fortress\r\nand on the 9th, the storming column led the advance as the victorious\r\narmy marched into Port Hudson to put the Stars and Stripes in the place\r\nof the stars and bars.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln's long-desired hope was realized and he could now\r\nsay: \"The Father of Waters again goes unmolested to the sea.\" The time\r\nof the nine-months' men was soon to expire and the Twenty-fifth\r\nConnecticut left very soon for New Orleans, but was detained at\r\nDonaldsonville for a few days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAMUEL KIMBALL ELLIS\r\n               This picture was taken at time of enlistment Sept. 12,\r\n                   1863, at the age of 22. He enlisted as a private in\r\n                   Company G, 25th Regiment, Connecticut Volunteers.]\r\n\r\nAbout fifty years ago the people in the North were probably in a frenzy\r\nof excitement. We soldiers in the South had learned to take things\r\ncool. Vicksburg, the stumbling block, had fallen; Port Hudson had caved\r\nin; Lee and his army had gone to one eternal smash; Port Hudson had\r\nscarcely surrendered when we were called upon again to take the field.\r\nThose confounded Rebels didn't know how to stay whipped, and General\r\nTaylor, reinforced by General Magruder's Texicans, had again taken the\r\nfield. They attacked us at Donaldsonville with a much larger force in\r\nproportion to ours but got soundly thrashed; we being strongly\r\nreinforced, came out to meet them and got whipped, and so the matter\r\nrested. The commanding officer of the brigade was flanked through\r\ncarelessness and they had to fall back with a loss of two cannon. Our\r\nbrigade was on the reserve. We fell in and rushed to the rescue but too\r\nlate, for they were in full retreat. A new line was formed, the\r\nTwenty-fifth deployed as skirmishers and sent forward. After advancing\r\nquite a distance through the corn we were ordered back and our whole\r\nforce fell back about half a mile, where we were still holding a strong\r\nposition. The Rebels meanwhile had left and fortified at Labordieville,\r\nsome twenty miles distant. The Twenty-fifth Connecticut regiment, after\r\none of the most trying campaigns of the war, was about to take another\r\nsea voyage.\r\n\r\nHere are a few verses which I have written on the siege of Port Hudson:\r\n\r\n    PORT HUDSON.\r\n\r\n    Well do I remember, how fifty years ago,\r\n    Down on the banks of the Mississippi,\r\n    We met the Southern foe,\r\n    And faced a storm of shot and shell;\r\n    That many a life was sacrificed\r\n    Mid battle hell of smoke and flame\r\n    On the field of Port Hudson.\r\n\r\n    Well do I remember, how those days,\r\n    The gallant Third Brigade went\r\n    Marching down into the woods\r\n    Like men on dress parade;\r\n    Though from the wood in front\r\n    The foe their deadly missiles sent.\r\n    Thinning our ranks\r\n    Those days at Bloody Port Hudson.\r\n\r\n    How on the left the Connecticut Thirteenth engaged in desperate fight\r\n    And left in front the Twenty-fifth was marshaled on the right;\r\n    Side by side, New York and Maine for honors did contend,\r\n    When Rebel yell and Yankee cheer was heard at Port Hudson.\r\n\r\n    And though we drove away the foe\r\n    How dear was victory won,\r\n    For when the din of battle ceased,\r\n    The burning sun shone down upon the bloody field\r\n    And shone on foe and friend,\r\n    Who bravely met a soldier's fate,\r\n    That day on the field of Port Hudson.\r\n\r\n    Now fifty years have gone,\r\n    How soon they pass away,\r\n    Since we did wear the army blue;\r\n    And now we wear the gray,\r\n    For time has turned our hair to gray,\r\n    To show us near the end,\r\n    And soon will none be left to\r\n    Tell the tale of Port Hudson.\r\n\r\n    Were I to pledge those bygone days\r\n    Oh this would be my toast:\r\n    \"Here's to the dear old Stars and Stripes,\r\n    Our country's pride and boast;\r\n    Here's to the Union Volunteers,\r\n    Who did the flag defend,\r\n    And here's to my old comrades\r\n    Who fought at Port Hudson.\"\r\n\r\nAugust 8th. It was a beautiful morning and we were in camp waiting for\r\norders to start. We had orders to be ready to go on board the Steamer\r\nThomas Scott at twelve o'clock. At two o'clock we were gliding down the\r\nold Mississippi. We stopped at New Orleans, took some horses aboard and\r\nstarted again at about six o'clock. Arrived at the mouth of the\r\nMississippi at midnight. Here we waited for a pilot, took him on board\r\nand was off again.\r\n\r\nAugust 9th, Sunday. At 6:30 o'clock we passed the bar, left the pilot\r\nand in a short time were out of sight of land. The captain of the boat\r\nsaid he would land us in New York by Saturday night, if all went well.\r\n\r\nAugust 10th. It was a fine morning and we were enjoying ourselves with\r\na deck passage at that.\r\n\r\nAugust 11th. This morning we passed several lighthouses; one was upon\r\nTortugas Island.\r\n\r\nAugust 12th. The old steamer was making good speed. Comrade Chadwick\r\ndied last night; this morning he was buried at sea. He was a member of\r\nour regiment and enlisted from Andover, this state.\r\n\r\nAugust 13th. This morning was very fine, but the ship rolled and\r\npitched considerable, owing to being in the Gulf Stream.\r\n\r\nAugust 14th. The old ship was making good speed and we were hoping to\r\nget into New York harbor by Saturday night, as it was getting pretty\r\ntiresome on the old filthy vessel, with the vermin almost unbearable.\r\n\r\nAugust 15th. This was a beautiful day and the old steamer continued\r\nmaking good time.\r\n\r\nAugust 16th. The day was fine and we expected to get into port at night\r\nand our expectations were realized, about seven o'clock after being in\r\nthis dirty place for a whole week.\r\n\r\nAugust 17th. We arrived in port last night but had to stay upon the\r\nship another night. I managed to get a small loaf of bread and if I\r\nremember correctly, I wasn't long devouring it, for we had had nothing\r\nbut hard-tack and raw salt pork to eat and condensed water to drink\r\nsince we went aboard the ship at New Orleans. This (Sunday) morning we\r\nwere allowed to go ashore and were kept penned up till about night when\r\nwe went aboard the good-looking old boat, City of Hartford. We arrived\r\nin Hartford, if my memory serves me correctly, at about 10 o'clock\r\nMonday morning, August 18th, 1863, and I guess we were about as tough a\r\nlooking set of fellows as ever came off the boat. Yes, I must admit, we\r\nwere a pretty hard looking set, what there was left of us, for we had\r\ndwindled down to less than one-third the number which left Hartford\r\nabout a year previous. What a change had come over us. Why, some of our\r\nfriends didn't know us, we had changed so. One comrade in particular I\r\nwill mention, Wm. Goodrich. He went from Glastonbury in my company. He\r\nwas a big fine looking man, weighing two hundred and fifty pounds when\r\nwe went away, and when he came home he hardly weighed one hundred and\r\nfifty. Was it any wonder that our friends couldn't recognize us with\r\nthe beards we had grown on our faces, and the soiled clothing we were\r\nwearing? Well, I finally reached home and you can imagine how glad I\r\nwas. I think that I felt much as the Prodigal Son did when he returned\r\nhome. To get my clothes off and get into a good bed, (which I had not\r\ndone for about a year) and to be cared for by a kind and loving mother,\r\nI never felt more like singing, \"Home, Sweet Home.\"\r\n\r\nIn closing this sketch of the gallant Twenty-fifth Regiment, I would\r\nsay that war, as far as my experience goes, is not the thing it's\r\ncracked up to be. Though anyone can get used to all kinds of horrid\r\nsights, in a measure, I could tell some things that I don't think one\r\nwould care to hear. But I will omit all description as it is best\r\nlearned by experience. I think scant justice has been done to the\r\nNineteenth Army Corps and General Banks, inasmuch as the field of\r\naction while in Louisiana was far away and until the fall of Port\r\nHudson, was cut off from the North except by the sea. The public\r\nattention was taken up in the States along the border and even our\r\ngreat victory at Port Hudson was eclipsed and looked upon as a\r\nconsequence of the fall at Vicksburg. But they did a great deal of hard\r\nfighting and made hundreds of miles of hard marchings in a climate to\r\nwhich the men were not accustomed.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Interesting Incident.\r\n\r\nIt was in the Spring of 1863, and General Banks had inaugurated the\r\ncampaign which ended in the capture of the last stronghold. We had\r\nmarched to the very outworks of Port Hudson, and engaged the\r\nConfederate forces, on that historic night, when lashed to the maintop,\r\nhigh above the boiling surges, stout-hearted, Farragut, drove his\r\nvessels through the storm of shot and shell, that was hurled upon him\r\nfrom the heights above, and cut the Rebel communications between Port\r\nHudson and Vicksburg. These two fortified places were the only ones\r\nleft on the Mississippi River, not in our hands. Grant, was already\r\nhammering at Vicksburg, but before Port Hudson could be invested, it\r\nwas necessary to dispose of Confederate General Taylor and his forces,\r\nwho from their position in the South, could fall upon our unprotected\r\nrear or make a dash for New Orleans. Returning then, to our camp at\r\nBaton Rouge, after a few days' rest, we were suddenly divided into two\r\nforces, one marching down through the country, to engage the enemy at\r\nNew Iberia, and the rest of us sent around by water and up through the\r\nAtchafalaya to intercept and cut them to pieces. It was only a partial\r\nsuccess. Driven from their position in Fort Bisland, they fell upon us\r\nbefore we were fairly in position, and held us in check while the whole\r\narmy slipped by. Then commenced a long pursuit, enlivened by daily\r\nskirmish and fighting which lasted from the shores of the Gulf to\r\nShreveport, in the extreme northwestern corner of the state where they\r\nwere driven across the border into Texas.\r\n\r\nIt was on this march that the incident occurred which I am about to\r\nnarrate. We had been marching all day, in fact, from before the dawn,\r\ntrying to reach the Bayou Vermillion, before the enemy could destroy\r\nthe bridge. Men fell out by the scores, but still we hurried on with\r\nall the speed our wearied limbs could support. Just as it was growing\r\ntoo dark to see, a battery opened upon us, and there was a sharp charge\r\nof cavalry. We were hastily thrown into position to receive them, but\r\nin an instant, wheeling, they dashed across the bridge, destroying it\r\nin our very faces before it could be prevented.\r\n\r\nThe next day was Sunday and while we camped there waiting for the\r\nconstruction of a new bridge, about half the advance division took the\r\nopportunity to strip and go in bathing. Suddenly, without an instant's\r\nwarning, a troupe of cavalry dashed down the opposite bank, and opened\r\nfire upon us. Such a spectacle never before was seen. The long roll was\r\nsounding and naked men, in every direction were making a dash for their\r\nguns, trying to dress as they ran. Some with their trousers on hind\r\nside before, didn't know whether they were advancing or retreating, and\r\nsome ran the wrong way, others, with simply a shirt and cap, were\r\ntrying to adjust their belts. Officers were swearing and mounted aids\r\nwere dashing about, trying to make order out of confusion.\r\n\r\nThe next day we were ordered to Barry's Landing, to act as guard for a\r\nsteamer coming up through the bayous with supplies, and here my story\r\nproperly begins. It was April 22, 1863, and the regiment, exhausted by\r\nthe conflict of the 14th, and the rapid march ensuing, following hard\r\nupon the track of Taylor's flying forces, from Franklin to Opelousas,\r\nwas resting at Barry's Landing, when suddenly the whole camp was thrown\r\ninto a ferment of excitement by the news that the paymaster had\r\narrived, and would be at headquarters at 12 o'clock. Oh, welcome news\r\nto men who had been without pay for six months. How the eye glistened,\r\nand the mouth watered for the leeks and flesh-pots of Louisiana!\r\n\r\nWhat visions of Sutler's delicacies opened up once more to those whom\r\nlong-tick had gradually restricted to a Spartan diet of hard-tack and\r\nsalt pork. What thoughts of home and the money that could be sent to\r\nloved ones far away, suffering, perhaps for lack of that very\r\nmoney--but how to do it,--there was the question. Here we were in the\r\nvery heart of the Rebel country, two hundred miles at least from New\r\nOrleans, in the midst of an active campaign. No opportunity to send\r\nletters except such as chance threw in the way, and no certainty that\r\nsuch letters would ever reach their destination. Added to this, came\r\nthe order to be ready to march at four o'clock. Whither we knew not,\r\nbut the foe was ahead, and our late experience had taught us that life\r\nwas but an uncertain element and that a Rebel bullet had a very\r\ncareless way of seeking out and finding its victim. In the midst of all\r\nthe bustle and confusion, the sergeant-major, William E. Simonds came\r\ntearing along through the camp excitedly inquiring for Lieut. Goodell.\r\nThat estimable officer, I am sorry to say, having received no pay,\r\nowing to some informality in his papers when mustered in from second to\r\nfirst lieutenant, had retired into the shade of a neighboring magnolia\r\ntree, and was there meditating on the cussedness of paymasters,\r\nmustering officers, the army in general. In fact, everything looked\r\nuncommonly black and never before had he so strongly believed in\r\nuniversal damnation. To him, then, thus communing came Sergeant-major\r\nSimonds, and said: \"You will report for duty at once to headquarters;\r\nyou are directed to receive the pay of the regiment and proceed\r\nforthwith to New Orleans, there to express same home, returning to the\r\nregiment as soon thereafter as practicable.\"\r\n\r\nThe rest we will let Lieut. Goodell tell in his own way:\r\n\r\n                    *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n    How the Pay of a Regiment Was Carried to New Orleans\r\n    by Lieutenant Henry Hill Goodell.\r\n\r\n    \"Gone at once were my sulks, vanished in an instant my ill-humor,\r\n    black demons and everything. Though I could not help wondering how\r\n    in all creation I was going to perform a journey of several hundred\r\n    miles that would occupy a week at least without a cent of money in\r\n    my pocket, a clerk was detailed to assist me, and for the next hour\r\n    I counted money over a hard-tack box, jamming it away instantly\r\n    into my haversack while he entered in a little book the amount\r\n    received from each person, the sums given to pay for its expressage,\r\n    and the addresses to which it was to be sent. No time to make\r\n    change. Even sums were given, counted, and tucked away with rapidity.\r\n    At the landing was a little stern-wheel steamer, captured from the\r\n    Rebels, which was to leave from Brashear City in an hour or two.\r\n    The sick and wounded were hastily transferred to it, and as the\r\n    regiment marched off, I stepped on board with my precious haversack,\r\n    now swollen out to unwonted proportions. Not a state-room, not a\r\n    berth was to be had. There was no safe in which I could deposit\r\n    valuables. Too many knew what I was carrying, and I dared not for\r\n    an instant lift the weight from my shoulder or to remove my sword\r\n    and pistol. Like Mary's lamb, where'er I went, the haversack was\r\n    sure to go.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HENRY HILL GOODELL\r\n               Deceased\r\n               Served as 2nd and 1st Lieutenant, Co. F, 25th Regiment,\r\n                   Connecticut Volunteers.]\r\n\r\n    \"Never shall I forget the beauty of that sail, and but for the\r\n    feeling of distrust and suspicion that made me look upon every man\r\n    that approached me, as a personal enemy, I should have thoroughly\r\n    enjoyed it. We were dropping down one of those little bayous that\r\n    intersect the state in every direction. The spring freshets had\r\n    swollen the stream and set its waters far back into the forests\r\n    that lined its banks on either side. Festoons of Spanish moss,\r\n    drooped like a mourning veil from bough to bough. Running vines\r\n    with bright colored sprays of flowers twined in and out among the\r\n    branches of the trees. The purple passion flowers flung out its\r\n    starry blossoms to the world, the sign and symbol of the suffering\r\n    Saviour. While the air was heavy with the scent of magnolias and\r\n    yellow jassamine. Crested herons, snowy white, rose from the water,\r\n    and stretching their long necks and legs out into a straight line\r\n    with their bodies winged their flight above the tree-tops. Pelicans\r\n    displayed their ungainly forms, as they snapped at the passing fish\r\n    and neatly laid them away for future reference in their pouches.\r\n    Strange birds of gaudy plumage flew from side to side, harshly\r\n    screaming as they hid themselves in the dense foliage. Huge\r\n    alligators sunned themselves along the shore, or showed their\r\n    savage muzzles, as they slowly swam across our path. Frequently at\r\n    some sharp bend, it seemed as if we must certainly run ashore, but\r\n    the engine being reversed, the current would swing the bow around\r\n    and by dint of hard pushing with poles, we would escape the\r\n    threatened danger, and start again in our new direction. Sunset\r\n    faded into twilight, and twilight deepened into the darkness, and\r\n    silence of a Southern night, and then the entire loneliness and\r\n    responsibility of my position suddenly overwhelmed me. I had no\r\n    place to lie down, and hardly dared sit for fear of falling asleep.\r\n    It seemed as though I could hear whispers behind me, and every now\r\n    and then I would catch myself nodding, and wake with a cold chill\r\n    running up and down the small of my back, as I felt sure that some\r\n    unlawful hand was tampering with my burden. With the coming of the\r\n    dawn, I breathed more freely, and the day seemed interminable, and\r\n    it became a very burden to live. Twice we broke down and tying up\r\n    to a friendly tree repaired the damage. Night came again and found\r\n    us still miles away from our destination. It was horrible. I walked\r\n    the deck, drank coffee, pinched myself. 'Oh, if I can only keep\r\n    awake!' I kept repeating to myself. But at 2 o'clock in the morning\r\n    we broke down again, with the prospect of being detained some\r\n    hours. I knew that if I did not reach Brashear City by 7 o'clock I\r\n    should be another dreary day on the way, and lose my connections\r\n    with the single train for New Orleans. Time was an element of\r\n    importance, for I should lose the mail steamer for New York and be\r\n    delayed in my return to the regiment which I had left in the heart\r\n    of Louisiana marching onward--I knew not where, but with faces set\r\n    toward the North.\r\n\r\n    \"Finding that we were distant from eight to twelve miles across\r\n    country according to the different estimates, I determined to make\r\n    the attempt to reach it on foot. Any danger, anything seemed\r\n    preferable to staying on the boat. With the first breaking of the\r\n    dawn, when I could get my bearings, I slung myself ashore. A\r\n    private in my regiment discharged for disability, begged to\r\n    accompany me. With weapons ready for instant use, we pushed along,\r\n    afraid of our own shadows, looking for a lurking foe behind every\r\n    bush, and when some startled bird suddenly broke from its cover,\r\n    the heart of one at least stood still for a moment and then\r\n    throbbed away like a steam engine. If a man was seen, however\r\n    distant, we dropped to cover and watched him out of sight before we\r\n    dared move. For the first mile our progress was very slow--now\r\n    wading through water, now sinking in the mud, floundering about as\r\n    best we could, while the mosquitoes and gnats settled down on us in\r\n    swarms, uttering a triumphant buzzing as though they recognized the\r\n    fact that they had fresher blood to feed on than that offered by\r\n    the fever-stricken victims of the South and were determined to make\r\n    the most of their opportunity. But the open country once reached we\r\n    lengthened out our steps and struck into a six-mile gait. Soon my\r\n    companion began to falter and fall behind. But I could not afford\r\n    to wait, telling him I presumed he was all right, but I could not\r\n    run any risks, I stood him up by a tree and taking his gun, marched\r\n    off a couple hundred yards, then laying it down I shouted to him to\r\n    come on, and, setting off at the top of my speed, saw him no more.\r\n    Whether he ever reached his destination or whether wandering\r\n    helplessly along--he was swooped down upon by some gorilla, and led\r\n    away to starve and die in a Southern prison, I did not learn for\r\n    many years. At the last reunion I attended, I was called upon to\r\n    respond to the toast 'The Postal Service of the Regiment, and What\r\n    You Know About It,' and at the conclusion of my remarks, a stout\r\n    grizzled veteran grasped my hand and said: 'Look, I'm glad to see\r\n    you. I thought it pretty cruel to leave me alone in Dixie, but you\r\n    had warned me beforehand and I guess you were right.'\r\n\r\n    \"Avoiding the houses and striking across the fields, I made the\r\n    last part of my way at full run, and drew up panting and exhausted\r\n    at Berwick Bay shortly after six. Not a moment was to be lost. I\r\n    could hear the engine puffing across the waters. Shouting to a\r\n    darkey, who seemed to rise up preternaturally out of the ground, I\r\n    ordered him to row me over; and a more astonished man I think I\r\n    never saw than he was. When on reaching the opposite shore, with\r\n    but ten minutes to spare, I bolted from the boat without a word,\r\n    and started on the run for headquarters. The general was asleep,\r\n    but an aid carried in my pass, signed by General Banks, brought it\r\n    back countersigned, and in five minutes more I was aboard the train\r\n    moving on to New Orleans.\r\n\r\n    \"Of this part of my journey I have a very indistinct remembrance.\r\n    My impression is that I dozed whenever I sat down, and I was so\r\n    tired I could hardly stand. I had had nothing to eat since the\r\n    night before and was faint and exhausted with hunger, and my\r\n    exertions. Nothing but the special training my class had taken in\r\n    gymnasium during the previous year, for just such an emergency,\r\n    pulled me through the long run and long fast following it. It was\r\n    only a run of 100 miles but I think we must have stopped to wood\r\n    and water at every cotton-wood grove and swamp along the way; and I\r\n    remember at one of these periodical stops, going out on the\r\n    platform, and falling into an altercation with a little red-headed\r\n    doctor, who, whether he had scented my secret or not, with that\r\n    divine intuition for discovering the hidden, peculiar to the craft,\r\n    had made himself officially offensive to me, and now, wanted to\r\n    borrow my revolver to shoot a copper-head that lay coiled up by the\r\n    side of the track. Refused in that, he next wanted to examine my\r\n    sword, and when under some trifling pretext, I abruptly left him\r\n    and going inside the car, sat down as near as possible to a\r\n    bluff-looking lieutenant, whose honest face seemed a true\r\n    indication of character, his wrath knew no bounds and was quite\r\n    outspoken. 'Peace to your injured spirit, oh fiery-headed son of\r\n    Esculapius, if you are still in the land of the living! I here\r\n    tender you my humble apologies. Doubtless you intended nothing more\r\n    than to compare the efficiency of my leaden balls with one of your\r\n    own deadly Bolouses or to see how my cleaver compared in sharpness\r\n    with one of your own little scalpels.' But at that particular time\r\n    I should have been suspicious of my own brother had he desired to\r\n    inspect or use my arms.\r\n\r\n    \"It was late Saturday afternoon when, tired and faint, I landed in\r\n    the city. Pushing straight to the office of the Adams Express\r\n    Company, I told them I had the pay of a regiment to express home\r\n    and wanted five or six hundred money order blanks and envelopes. I\r\n    shall never forget the look of incredulity with which the clerk\r\n    looked at me. I was dirty and ragged, just in from the front, with\r\n    no shoulder-straps, for we had been ordered to remove them and\r\n    diminish the chances of being picked off by the sharpshooters but\r\n    had sword and pistol and an innocent looking haversack hanging at\r\n    my side. However, he said not a word, but passed over the papers.\r\n\r\n    \"My next adventure was in a saloon where on calling for a drink of\r\n    whiskey, I was informed that they were not allowed to sell to\r\n    privates. On my throwing down my pass signed by Gen. Banks, the\r\n    courteous keeper acknowledged his mistake, and invited me to take\r\n    something at his expense. Immediately after supper to which--it is\r\n    hardly necessary to say--I was accompanied by that confounded\r\n    haversack, I fairly loathed it by this time--I retired to my room,\r\n    locked the door and went to work. Excitement kept me up and by 2\r\n    o'clock everything was done. The money counted and placed in the\r\n    envelopes, and the blanks filled out, and the footing correctly\r\n    made. Then, only did I know how much I had carried with me and how\r\n    precious were the contents of my haversack. Barricading my door,\r\n    with the table, and wedging a chair in between it and the bed, I\r\n    thrust the haversack between the sheets, slid in after it, laid my\r\n    revolver by the pillow, and in an instant was sound asleep. The\r\n    next morning on going down to breakfast I innocently inquired of\r\n    the clerk in the office if he would give me a receipt for\r\n    valuables. 'Certainly,' was his smiling rejoinder. 'For how much?'\r\n    'Twenty-four thousand three hundred and forty-six dollars,' I\r\n    replied and half opening my haversack, showed him the bundles of\r\n    express envelopes, explaining that it was the pay of a regiment.\r\n    'Where did you keep this last night?' was the next question. 'In my\r\n    room.' 'You d---- fool, it might have been stolen.' 'True, but I\r\n    thought it would be safe enough and besides I did not know how much\r\n    I had.'\r\n\r\n    \"Breakfast over I repaired at once to the office of the express\r\n    company and by noon, with my receipts in my pocket, I stepped\r\n    forth, feeling as if a gigantic load had rolled from my shoulders.\r\n\r\n    \"Of my journey back there is no need to speak; suffice it to say\r\n    that two or three weeks thereafter, one night as the sun was\r\n    setting, I stood with beating heart on the levee, outside of\r\n    Simsport on the Red River, waiting for the coming of the regiment\r\n    on its march down from Alexandria. Column after column passed and\r\n    still I waited. But suddenly I caught the roll of drums and there\r\n    came a dimness over my eyes, for I recognized familiar forms. The\r\n    colonel riding at the head, the little drum major, the colors and\r\n    each well known face. As they came up I saluted, someone recognized\r\n    me, and called my name. Instantly the cry, 'Lieutenant Goodell has\r\n    come!' swept down the line, and with one mighty shout, the boys\r\n    welcomed back the bearer of their pay. That night I went from\r\n    camp-fire to camp-fire and gave to each orderly sergeant the\r\n    receipts for his company. Of all that money, only one envelope went\r\n    astray, and the express company made good the loss.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROSTER.\r\n\r\nThe following gives as near a complete list of those who served with my\r\nregiment:\r\n\r\nCOMPANY A.\r\n\r\nCaptains.\r\n\r\nMacon C.
