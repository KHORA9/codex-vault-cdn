1770.]\r\n--\"And the Governor for the time being shall have full power and\r\nauthority from time to time as he shall judge necessary, to adjourn,\r\nprorogue and dissolve all Great and General Courts or Assemblies met\r\nand conven'd as aforesaid.\"--1\r\n\r\nTHE power delegated by this clause to the Governor was undoubtedly\r\nintended in favor of the people--The necessity and importance of a\r\nlegislative in being, and of its having the opportunity of exerting\r\nitself upon all proper occasions, must be obvious to a man of common\r\ndiscernment. Its grand object is the REDRESS OF GRIEVANCES: And for\r\nthis purpose it is adjudg'd that parliaments ought to be held\r\nfrequently--The people may be aggriev'd for the want of having a good\r\nlaw made, as well as repealing a bad one: So they may be, by the mal\r\nconduct of the executive in its manner of administring justice\r\nwrongfully under colour of law. In all these cases and many others,\r\nthe necessity of the frequent interposition of the legislative\r\nevidently appears. And if either of them, much more, if all of them\r\nshould at any time be justly complain'd of by the people, the\r\nadjourning, proroguing or dissolving the legislative, at such a\r\njuncture, must be the greatest of all grievances--There may be other\r\nreasons for the sitting of an American assembly besides the correcting\r\nany disorders arising from among the people within its own\r\njurisdiction.--Some of the Acts of the British parliament are\r\ngenerally thought to be grievous in their operation, and dangerous in\r\ntheir consequences to the liberties of the American subjects: An\r\nAmerican legislative therefore, in which the whole body of the people\r\nis represented, ought certainly to have the opportunity of explaining\r\nand remonstrating their grievances to the British parliament, and the\r\nfull exercise of that invaluable and uncontroulable Right of the\r\nsubject to petition the King, as often as they judge necessary, 'till\r\nthey are removed. To postpone a meeting of this universal body of the\r\npeople till it is too late to make such application must be a\r\nfrustration of one grand design of its existance; and it naturally\r\ntends to other arbitrary exertions.--I have often tho't that in former\r\nadministrations such delays to call the general assembly, were\r\nintended for the purpose above-mentioned: And if others should have\r\nthe same apprehension at present I cannot help it, nor am I answerable\r\nfor it. It may not be amiss however for every man to make it a subject\r\nof his contemplation. We all remember that no longer ago than the last\r\nyear, the extraordinary dissolution by Governor Bernard, in which he\r\ndeclared he was merely ministerial, produced another assembly, which\r\ntho' legal in all its proceedings, awaked an attention in the very soul\r\nof the British empire.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be expected that in ordinary times, much less at such an\r\nimportant period as this is, any man, tho' endowed with the wisdom of\r\nSolomon, at the distance of three thousand miles, can be an adequate\r\njudge of the expediency of proroguing, and in effect even putting an\r\nend to an American legislative assembly; and more especially at a time\r\nwhen the evil spirit of Misrepresentation is become so atrocious, that\r\neven M. . .y itself is liable to be wrongly informed!--It is for this\r\nreason that the delegation of this power to the governor for the time\r\nbeing, appears to be intended in favor of the people: That there might\r\nbe always at the head of the province, and resident therein, as the\r\ncharter provides, a person of untainted integrity, candor,\r\nimpartiality and wisdom, to judge of and determine so essential a\r\npoint--A point, in which I should think, no person who justly deserves\r\nthis character, can be passive or merely ministerial, against his own\r\njudgment and conscience. Whenever therefore a Governor for the time\r\nbeing, adjourns, prorogues or dissolves the general assembly, having\r\nthe full power and authority delegated to him of judging from time to\r\ntime of the Necessity of it, we ought to presume that he exercises\r\nthat power with freedom: That he determines according to the light of\r\nhis own understanding, and not anothers: That he clearly sees that it\r\nwill answer those purposes which he himself judges to be best; having,\r\nas a man of fidelity in his station ought, thoro'ly revolv'd the\r\nmatter in his own mind: And, that however flattering the concurrent\r\nsentiments of any other man may be, he would have been impelled to do\r\nit, from the dictates of his own judgment, resulting from his own\r\ncontemplation of the matter, if he had not received the \"express\r\ncommand of his superior.\" Such a man \"will bravely act his mind, and\r\nventure--Death.\"\r\n\r\nVINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n1B. P. Poore, The Federal and State Constitutions, 1878, vol. i., p.\r\n949. vol. ii.--i.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE SIGNED \"DETERMINATUS.\"\r\n\r\n[Boston Gazette, January 8, 1770.]\r\n\r\nTo the Printers.\r\n\r\nThe agreement of the Merchants of this distressed and insulted\r\ncontinent, to with hold importations from Great Britain, it seems to\r\nbe allowed on all sides, has the strongest tendency towards the repeal\r\nof the acts of parliament for raising a revenue in America without our\r\nconsent. It is no wonder then, that it was oppos'd with so much\r\nvehemence at first, by the Cabal; who knew full well, that their\r\nPlaces and their Pensions, and all teh delectable profits which they\r\nexpected to reap, and are now actually reaping, at the expence of the\r\npeople in town and country, would entirely cease, if these acts, by\r\nthe means of which their places, pensions and profits arise should be\r\nrepealed--When they could no longer with any face call it the last\r\nefforts of a dying faction, (for the measure was so rational and\r\npacific, that it soon spread far and wide, and was chearfully adopted\r\nby all disinterested friends of the country thro'-out the continent)\r\nthey put on the appearance of the Sons of Liberty; and now their cry\r\nis, Where is that Liberty so much boasted of and contended for? We\r\nhear them very gravely asking, Have we not a right to carry on our own\r\ntrade and sell our own goods if we please? who shall hinder us? This\r\nis now the language of those who had before seen the ax laid at the\r\nvery root of all our Rights with apparent complacency,--And pray\r\ngentlemen, Have you not a right if you please, to set fire to your own\r\nhouses, because they are your own, tho' in all probability it will\r\ndestroy a whole neighbourhood, perhaps a whole city! Where did you\r\nlearn that in a state or society you had a right to do as you please?\r\nAnd that it was an infringement of that right to restrain you? This is\r\na refinement which I dare say, the true sons of liberty despise. Be\r\npleased to be informed that you are bound to conduct yourselves as the\r\nSociety with which you are joined, are pleased to have you conduct, or\r\nif you please, you may leave it. It is true the will and pleasure of\r\nthe society is generally declared in its laws: But there may be\r\nexceptions, and the present case is without doubt one.--Suppose there\r\nwas no law of society to restrain you from murdering your own father,\r\nwhat think you? If either of you should please to take it into your\r\nhead to perpetrate such a villainous act, so abhorrent to the will of\r\nthe society, would you not be restrained? And is the Liberty of your\r\nCountry of less importance than the life of your father! But what is\r\nmost astonishing is, that some two or three persons of very little\r\nconsequence in themselves, have Dared openly to give out that They\r\nWill vend the goods they have imported, tho' they have Solemnly\r\npledg'd Their Faith to the body of merchants, that they should remain\r\nin store 'till a general importation should take place! Where then is\r\nthe honor! where is the shame of these persons, who can look into the\r\nfaces of those very men with whom they have contracted, & tell them\r\nWithout Blushing that they are resolved to Violate the contract! Is it\r\navarice? Is it obstinacy, perverseness, pride, or from what root of\r\nbitterness does such an unaccountable defection from the laws of\r\nhonor, honesty, and even humanity spring? Is it the Authority Of An\r\nUnnatural Parent--the advice of some false friend, or their own want\r\nof common understanding, and the first principles of virtue, by which\r\nthese unhappy young persons have been induced, or left to resolve upon\r\nperpetrating that, at the very tho't of which they should have\r\nshudder'd! By this resolution they have already disgrac'd themselves;\r\nif they have the Hardiness to put the resolution into practice, who\r\nwill ever hereafter confide in them? Can they promise themselves the\r\nregards of the respectable body of merchants whom they have affronted?\r\nor can they even wish for the esteem of their country which they have\r\nbasely deserted, or worse, which they have attempted to wound in the\r\nvery heart.--If they imagine they can still weary the patience of an\r\ninjured country with impunity.--If--I will not utter it--would not the\r\ngrateful remembrance of unmerited kindness and Generosity, if there\r\nwas the least spark of ingenuity left, have Influenced to a far\r\ndifferent resolution!--If this agreement of the merchants is of that\r\nconsequence to All America which our brethren in All the other\r\ngovernments, and in Great-Britain Itself think it to be--If the fate\r\nof Unborn Millions is suspended upon it, verily it behooves, not the\r\nmerchants Only, but every individual of Every class in City and\r\nCountry to aid and support them and Peremptorily To Insist upon its\r\nbeing Strictly adhered to.\r\n\r\nDETERMINATUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TOWN OF BOSTON TO THE LIEUTENANT-GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS1\r\n\r\n[MS., Office of the City Clerk of Boston.]\r\n\r\nTo his Honor the Lieutenant Governor in Council\r\n\r\nThe Memorial of the Town of Boston legally assembled in Faneuil Hall\r\nMonday March 19 1770\r\n\r\nHumbly shews\r\n\r\nThat with deep Concern they are made to understand that thro the\r\nProvidence of God diverse of his Majestys Justices of the Superior\r\nCourt are renderd unable to attend the Duties of their important Trust\r\nby bodily Indisposition.\r\n\r\nThat there are a great Number of Prisoners now in his Majestys Gaol in\r\nthe County of Suffolk, of whom fifteen are confind for Tryal for\r\ncapital offences.\r\n\r\nThat the Sherriff of said County has been under Apprehension of the\r\nEscape of said Prisoners as appears by his Letter to the Town hereto\r\nannexd to be laid before your honor.\r\n\r\nThat there are a great Number of Witnesses in the Cases of the late\r\nTrajical Murder in Boston many of whom are Seamen & detaind to their\r\nvery great Disadvantage & possibly some of them may be under\r\nTemptation to absent themselves from the Tryal.\r\n\r\nAll which the Town beg leave humbly to represent to your honor as\r\ncogent Reasons for the Tryal of the said Prisoners as early as\r\npossible in the present Term.\r\n\r\nWherefore your Memorialists humbly pray your Honor to appoint special\r\nJustices in the Room of those taken off as aforesaid,2 in order for\r\nthe Tryal of the said Prisoners, or otherwise that your Honor wd take\r\nsuch Steps to prevent the Delay of Justice at this important Crisis as\r\nin your Wisdom shall seem meet.\r\n\r\nAnd as in Duty bound your Memsts shall ever pray.\r\n\r\nSignd in Behalf of the Town at the Meeting aforesaid.\r\n\r\n1Samuel Adams, John Hancock, and John Barret were on March 19, 1770,\r\nappointed by the Boston town-meeting \"a Committee to draw up a\r\nMemorial to the Lieuvetenant Governor and Council praying that special\r\nJustices may be appointed for the Superior Court now sitting in the\r\nroom of those who may be necessarily prevented by sickness from\r\nattending their duty; that so the Tryals of the many Criminals now\r\ncommitted may not be postponed. . . .\" At the same session the\r\ncommittee reported a draft, which was accepted.--Boston Record\r\nCommissioners' Report, vol. xviii., p. 15.

I could not think you had sufficient Ground to deprive the\r\nTown of one whom I have a Right to say is a most valueable Member,\r\nsince you had within three of the unanimous Suffrages of your Fellow\r\nCitizens, & one of the negative Votes was your own.1 You say you have\r\nbeen spoken ill of. What then? Can you think that while you are a good\r\nMan that all will speak well of you--If you knew the person who has\r\ndefamd you nothing is more likely than that you would justly value\r\nyour self upon that mans Censure as being the highest Applause. Those\r\nwho were fond of continuing Mr Otis on the Seat, were I dare say to a\r\nMan among your warmest friends: Will you then add to their\r\nDisappointment by a Resignation, merely because one contemptible\r\nperson, who perhaps was hired for the purpose, has blessd you with his\r\nreviling--Need I add more than to intreat it as a favor that you would\r\nalter your Design.\r\n\r\nI am with strict truth\r\nYour affectionate friend & Brother.\r\n\r\n\r\n1At the Boston town-meeting on May 8, 1770, Hancock received, as a\r\ncandidate for representative, 511 out of 513 votes.

We were very apprehensive that all attempts would be\r\nmade to gain this Advantage against us: and as there is no occasion to\r\nthink that the malice of our Enemies is in the least degree abated, it\r\nhas been thought necessary that our friends on your side the Water,\r\nshould have a true state of the Circumstances of the Town and of\r\neverything which has materially occurred, since the removal of the\r\nTroops to the Castle. For this purpose we are appointed a Committee:2\r\nBut the time will not admit of our writing so fully by this\r\nConveyance, as we intend by the next, in the mean time we intreat your\r\nfurther friendship for the Town, in your Endeavours to get the\r\nJudgment of the Public suspended, upon any representation that may\r\nhave been made by the Commissioners of the Customs and others, until\r\nthe Town can have the Opportunity of knowing what is alleged against\r\nit, and of answering for itself. We must confess that we are\r\nastonished to hear that the Parliament had come to a determination, to\r\nadmit Garbled extracts from such Letters as may be received from\r\nAmerica by Administration and to Conceal the Names of the Persons who\r\nmay be the Writers of them. This will certainly give great\r\nEncouragement to Persons of wicked Intentions to abuse the Nations &\r\ninjure the Colonies in the grossest manner with Impunity, or even\r\nwithout detection. For a Confirmation hereof we need to recur no\r\nfurther back than a few months, when undoubtedly the Accounts and\r\nLetters carried by Mr. Rob[in]son would have been attended with very\r\nunhappy if not fatal effects, had not this Town been so attentive as\r\nto have Contradicted those false accounts by the depositions of many\r\ncredible persons under Oath. But it cannot be supposed that a\r\nCommunity will be so Attentive but upon the most Alarming Events: In\r\ngeneral Individuals are following their private concerns, while it is\r\nto be feared the restless Adversaries are forming the most dangerous\r\nPlans for the Ruin of the Reputation of the People, in order to build\r\ntheir own Greatness on the Distruction of their liberties. This Game\r\nthey have been long playing; and tho' in some few instances they have\r\nhad a loosing hand, yet they have commonly managed with such Art, that\r\nthey have so far succeeded in their Malicious designs as to involve\r\nthe Nation and the Colonies in Confusion and distress. This it is\r\npresumed they never could have accomplished had not these very letters\r\nbeen kept from the view of the Public, with a design perhaps to\r\nconceal the falsehood of them the discovery of which would have\r\nprevented their having any mischievous effects. This is the Game which\r\nwe have reason to believe they are now playing; With so much Secrecy\r\nas may render it impossible for us fully to detect them on this Side\r\nof the Water; How deplorable then must be our Condition, if ample\r\nCredit is to be given to their Testimonies against us, by the Government\r\nat home, and if the Names of our Accusers are to be kept a profound\r\nSecret, and the World is to see only such parts or parcells of their\r\nRepresentations as Persons, who perhaps may be interested in their\r\nfavor, shall think proper to hold up--Such a Conduct, if allowed,\r\nseems to put it into the Power of a Combination of a few designing\r\nmen to deceive a Nation to its Ruin. The measures which have been\r\ntaken in Consequence of Intelligence Managed with such secrecy,\r\nhave already to a very great degree lessened that Mutual Confidence\r\nwhich had ever Subsisted between the Mother Country and the Colonies,\r\nand must in the Natural Course of things totally alienate their\r\nAffections towards each other and consequently weaken, and in the\r\nEnd destroy the power of the Empire. It is in this extended View\r\nof things that our minds are affected--It is from these Apprehensions\r\nthat we earnestly wish that all communication between the two Countries\r\nof a public nature may be unvailed before the public: with the names\r\nof the persons who are concerned therein, then and not till then will\r\nAmerican affairs be under the direction of honest men, who are never\r\nafraid or ashamed of the light. And as we have abudent reason to be\r\njealous that the most mischievous and virulent accounts have been\r\nvery lately sent to Administration from Castle William where the\r\nCommissioners have again retreated for no reason that we can conceive\r\nbut after their former manner to misrepresent and injure this Town and\r\nProvince,--we earnestly intreat that you would use your utmost influence\r\nto have an Order passed that the whole of the packetts sent by the\r\nCommissioners of the Customs and others under the care of one Mr Bacon\r\nlate an officer of the Customs in Virginia, who took his passage the\r\nlast week in the Brigantine Lydia Joseph Wood Commander may be laid\r\nbefore his Majesty in Council--\r\n\r\nIf the Writers of those Letters shall appear to be innocent, no harm\r\ncan possibly arise from such a measure; if otherwise, it may be the\r\nmeans of exploring the true Cause of the National and Collonial\r\nMalady, and of affording an easy remedy, and therefore the measure\r\nmust be justified & applauded by all the World.\r\n\r\nWe have observed in the English Papers, the most notorious falsehoods\r\npublished with an apparent design to give the World a prejudice\r\nagainst this Town, as the Aggressors in the unhappy Transaction of the\r\n5th of March, but no account has been more repugnant to the truth,\r\nthan a paper printed in the public Advertiser3 of the 28th of April\r\nwhich is called The case of Capt. Preston. As a Committee of this Town\r\nwe thought ourselves bound in faithfulness to wait on Capt Preston to\r\nenquire of him whether he was the Author--he frankly told us that he\r\nhad drawn a state of his case, but that it had passed thro different\r\nhands and was altered at different times, and finally the Publication\r\nin the Advertiser was varied from that which he sent home as his own;\r\nwe then desired him to let us know whether several parts which we\r\nmight point to him and to which we took exception were his own, but he\r\ndeclined Satisfying us herein, saying that the alterations were made\r\nby Persons who he supposed might aim at serving him, though he feared\r\nthey might have a Contrary effect, and that his discriminating to us\r\nthe parts of it which were his own from those which had been altered\r\nby others might displease his friends at a time when he might stand in\r\nneed of their essential Service; this was the Substance of the\r\nConversation between us, whereupon we retired and wrote to Capt\r\nPreston a Letter the Copy of which is now inclosed.4\r\n\r\nThe next day not receiving an answer from Capt. Preston at the time we\r\nproposed, we sent him a message desiring to be informed whether we\r\nmight expect his answer to which he replied by a Verbal Message as\r\nours was that he had nothing further to add to what he had said to us\r\nthe day before, as you'l please to observe by the inclosed\r\nCertificate--\r\n\r\nAs therefore Capt Preston has utterly declined to make good the\r\ncharges against the Town in the Paper called his case or to let us\r\nknow to whom we may apply as the Author or Authors of those parts\r\nwhich he might have disclaimed, and especially as the whole of his\r\ncase thus stated directly militates not only with his own Letter\r\npublished under his hand in the Boston Gazette, but with the\r\ndepositions of others annexed to our Narrative which were taken, not\r\nbehind the Curtain as some may have been, but openly and fairly, after\r\nnotifying the Parties interested, and before Magistrates to whose\r\ncredit the Governor of the Province has given his full attestation\r\nunder the Province Seal, we cannot think that the Paper called the\r\nCase of Capt. Thomas Preston, or any other Paper of the like import\r\ncan be deemed in the opinion of the sensible and impartial part of\r\nmankind as sufficient, in the least degree to prejudice the Character\r\nof the Town. It is therefore altogether needless for us to point out\r\nthe many falsehoods contained in this Paper; nor indeed would there be\r\ntime for it at present for the reason above mentioned--We cannot\r\nhowever omit taking notice of the artifice made use of by those who\r\ndrew up the statement, in insinuating that it was the design of the\r\nPeople to plunder the King's Chest, and for the more easily effecting\r\nthat to murder the Centinel posted at the Custom House where the money\r\nwas lodged. This intelligence is said to have been brought to Capt\r\nPreston by a Townsman, who assured him that he heard the mob declare\r\nthey would murder the Centinel.--The townsman probably was one\r\nGreenwood a Servant to the Commissioners whose deposition Number 96.5\r\nis inserted among others in the Narrative of the Town and of whom it\r\nis observed in a Marginal Note, that: \"Through the whole of his\r\nexamination he was so inconsistent, and so frequently contradicted\r\nhimself, that all present were convinced that no credit ought to be\r\ngiven to his deposition, for which reason it would not have been\r\ninserted had it not been known that a deposition was taken relating to\r\nthis affair, from this Greenwood by Justice Murray and carried home by\r\nMr. Robinson,\" and further \"this deponent is the only person, out of a\r\ngreat number of Witnesses examined, who heard anything mentioned of\r\nthe Custom House.\" Whether this part of the Case of Capt Preston was\r\ninserted by himself or some other person we are not told. It is very\r\nmuch to be questioned whether the information was given by any other\r\nthan Greenwood himself, and the sort of Character which he bears is so\r\nwell known to the Commissioners and their Connections some of whom\r\nprobably assisted Capt Preston in stating his Case, as to have made\r\nthem ashamed if they regarded the truth, to have given the least\r\ncredit to what he said.--Whoever may have helped them to this\r\nintelligence, we will venture to say, that it never has been and never\r\ncan be supported by the Testimony of any Man of a tolerable\r\nreputation. We shall only observe upon this occasion, how inveterate\r\nour Enemies here are, who, rather than omit what they might think a\r\nlucky opportunity of Slandering the Town, have wrought up a Narrative\r\nnot only unsupported by, but contrary to the clearest evidence of\r\nfacts and have even prevailed upon an unhappy Man under pretence of\r\nfriendship to him, to adopt it as his own: Though they must have known\r\nwith a common share of understanding, that it's being published to the\r\nworld as his own must have injured him, under his present\r\nCircumstances, in the most tender point, and so shocked was Capt\r\nPreston himself, at its appearing in the light on this side the Water,\r\nthat he was immediately apprehensive so glaring a falsehood would\r\nraise the indignation of a people to such a pitch as to prompt them to\r\nsome attempts that would be dangerous to him, and he accordingly\r\napplyed to Mr Sheriff Greenleaf for special protection on that\r\naccount: But the Sheriff assuring him that there was no such\r\ndisposition appearing among the People (which is an undoubted truth)\r\nCapt Preston's fears at length subsided: and he still remains in safe\r\ncustody, to be tried by the Superior Court of Judicature, at the next\r\nterm in August; unless the Judges shall think proper further to\r\npostpone the Trial, as they have done for one whole term, since he was\r\nindicted by the Grand Jury.\r\n\r\nBefore we conclude it may not be improper to observe that the removal\r\nof the troops was in the Slowest order, insomuch that eleven days were\r\nspent in carrying the two Regiments to Castle Island, which had before\r\nlanded in the Town in less than forty eight hours; yet in all this\r\ntime, while the number of the Troops was daily lessening, not the\r\nleast disorder was made by the inhabitants, tho' filled with a just\r\nindignation and horror at the blood of their fellow Citizens, so\r\ninhumanely spilt! And since their removal the Common Soldiers, have\r\nfrequently and even daily come up to the Town for necessary\r\nprovisions, and some of the officers, as well as several of the\r\nfamilies of the soldiers have resided in the Town and done business\r\ntherein without the least Molestation; yet so hardy have our Enemies\r\nbeen as to report in London that the enraged populace had hanged up\r\nCapt Preston.\r\n\r\nThe strange and irreconcileable conduct of the Commissioners of the\r\nCustoms since the 5th of March--their applying for leave to retire to\r\nthe Castle as early as the tenth, and spending their time in making\r\nexcursions into the Country 'till the 20th of June following, together\r\nwith other material Circumstances, are the subject of our present\r\nenquiry; the result of which you will be made acquainted with by the\r\nnext conveyance. In the mean time we remain with strict truth.--\r\n\r\nSir\r\nYour much obliged\r\nand most Obedient Servants\r\n\r\nTHOMAS CUSHING,WM PHILLIPS,\r\nRI DANA,WM MOLINEUX,\r\nSAML ADAMS,EBENEZER STORER,\r\nJOHN HANCOCK,WM GREENLEAF\r\n\r\n1Under the date of March 23, 1770, James Bowdoin, Samuel Pemberton and\r\nJoseph Warren, as a committee of the town of Boston, wrote to Lord\r\nDartmouth, enclosing a narrative of the events of March 5 and a\r\ncertified copy of the vote of town, on March 22, directing them to\r\ntransmit the printed narrative. The original letter is No. 320 of Lord\r\nDartmouth's American MSS., at Patshull House. The text of the same\r\nletter, which was addressed to the Duke of Richmond and others, is in\r\nA Short Narrative of the Horrid Massacre in Boston, New York, 1849.\r\n(This is reprinted, with notes by John Doggett, Jr., from a copy of\r\nthe original edition of 1770, in the library of the New York\r\nHistorical Society. Another reprint, with notes by Frederic Kidder,\r\nwas published at Albany, 1870.) The Additional Observations to a Short\r\nNarrative, 1770, are reprinted by Doggett, pp. 109-117.

After the most repeated &\r\nattentive Examination of your Speech, we find Nothing to induce us to\r\nalter our Opinion, and very little that is new & material in the\r\nControversy: But as we perceive it is publishd, it may possibly be\r\nread by some who have never seen the Reasons of the House; and as\r\nthere are specious things containd in it, which may have a Tendency to\r\nmake an unhappy Impression on some minds, we have thought proper to\r\nmake a few Observations upon it.\r\n\r\nYou are pleasd to say, \"you meet us at Cambridge, because you have no\r\nReason to think there has been any Alteration in his Majestys\r\nPleasure, which you doubt not was determind by wise motives, & with a\r\ngracious Purpose to promote the Good of the province.\" We presume not\r\nto call in Question the Wisdom of our Sovereign or the Rectitude of\r\nhis Intentions: But there have been Times, when a corrupt and\r\nprofligate Administration have venturd upon such Measures, as have had\r\na direct Tendency, to ruin the Interest of the People as well as that\r\nof their Royal Master.\r\n\r\nThis House have great Reason to doubt, whether it is, or ever was his\r\nMajestys Pleasure that your Honor should meet the Assembly at\r\nCambridge, or that he has ever taken the matter under his Royal\r\nConsideration: Because, the common and the best Evidence in such\r\nCases, is not communicated to us.\r\n\r\nIt is needless for us to add any thing to what has been heretofore\r\nsaid, upon the Illegality of holding the Court any where except in the\r\nTown of Boston: For admitting the Power to be in the Governor to hold\r\nthe Court in any other place when the publick Good requires it; yet,\r\nit by no means follows that he has a Right to call it at any other\r\nplace, when it is to the manifest Injury & Detriment of the Publick\r\n\r\nThe Opinion of the Attourney and Solicitor General has very little\r\nWeight with this House in any Case, any farther than the Reasons which\r\nthey expressly give are convincing. This Province has sufferd so much\r\nby unjust, groundless & illegal Opinions of those officers of the\r\nCrown, that our Veneration or Reverence for their Opinions is much\r\nabated. We utterly deny that the Attuorny & Solicitor General have any\r\nAuthority or Jurisdiction over us; any Right to decide Questions in\r\nControversy, between the several Branches of the Legislature here: Nor\r\ndo we concede, that even his Majesty in Council has any Constitutional\r\nAuthority to decide such Questions, or any other Controversy whatever\r\nthat arises in this Province, excepting only such Matters as are\r\nreservd in the Charter. It seems a great Absurdity, that when a\r\nDispute arises between the Governor and the House, the Governor should\r\nappeal to his Majesty in Council to decide it. Would it not be as\r\nreasonable for the House to appeal to the Body of their Constituents\r\nto decide it? Whenever a Dispute has arisen within the Realm, between\r\nthe Crown & the two Houses of Parliament, or either of them, was it\r\never imagind that the King in his privy Council had Authority to\r\ndecide it? However there is a Test, a Standard common to all, we mean\r\nthe publick Good. But your Honor must be very sensible that the\r\nIllegality of holding the Court in any other place besides the Town of\r\nBoston is far from being the only Dispute between your Honor & this\r\nHouse: we contend, that the People & their Representatives have a\r\nRight to withstand the abusive Exercise of a legal & constitutional\r\nPrerogative of the Crown. We beg Leave to recite to your Honor what\r\nthe Great Mr Locke has advancd in his Treatise of civil Government,\r\nupon the like Prerogative of the Crown. \"The old Question, says he,\r\nwill be asked in this matter of Prerogative, who shall be Judge when\r\nthis Power is made a right Use of?\" And he answers, \"Between an\r\nexecutive Power in being with such a Prerogative, and a Legislature\r\nthat depends upon his Will for their convening, there can be no Judge\r\non Earth, as there can be none between the Legislative & the People,\r\nshould either the Executive or Legislative when they have got the\r\nPower in their Hands, design or go about to enslave or destroy them.\r\nThe People have no other Remedy in this, as in all other Cases, where\r\nthey have no Judge on Earth, but to appeal to Heaven. For the Rulers,\r\nin such Attempts, exercising a Power the People never put into their\r\nHands (who can never be supposd to consent that any Body should rule\r\nover them for their Harm) do that which they have not a Right to do.\r\nAnd when the Body of the People or any single Man is deprivd of their\r\nRight, or under the Exercise of a Power without Right, and have no\r\nAppeal on Earth, then they have a Liberty to appeal to Heaven whenever\r\nthey judge the Cause of sufficient moment. And therefore, tho the\r\nPeople cannot be judge, so as to have by the Constitution of that\r\nSociety any superior Power to determine and give effective Sentence in\r\nthe Case; yet they have by a Law antecedent & paramount to all\r\npositive Laws of men, reservd that ultimate Determination to\r\nthemselves which belongs to all Mankind where there lies no Appeal on\r\nEarth viz to judge whether they have just Cause to make their Appeal\r\nto Heaven.\" We would however, by no means be understood to suggest\r\nthat this People have Occasion at present to proceed to such\r\nExtremity.\r\n\r\nYour Honor is pleasd to say, \"that the House of Representatives in the\r\nyear 1728, did not think the Form of the Writ, sufficient to justify\r\nthem in refusing to do Business at Salem\"; It is true they did not by\r\nany Vote or Resolve determine not to do Business yet the House, as we\r\nread in your Honors History, \"met and adjournd from Day to Day without\r\ndoing Business\";3 and we find by the Records, that from the 31 of\r\nOctober 1728 to the 14th of December following the House did meet and\r\nadjourn without doing Business; And then they voted to proceed to the\r\npublick & necessary Affairs of the province \"provided no Advantage be\r\nhad or made, for and by Reason of the aforesaid Removal (meaning the\r\nRemoval to Salem) or pleaded as a precedent for the future.\" Yet your\r\nHonor has been pleasd to quote the Conduct of that very House, as a\r\nprecedent for our Imitation. We apprehend their proceeding to\r\nBusiness, & the Consequences of it viz, the Encouragement it gave to\r\nGovernor Burnet to go on with his Design of harrassing them into\r\nunconstitutional Compliances, and the Use your Honor now makes of it\r\nas an Authority and a Precedent, ought to be a Warning to this House\r\nto make a determind & effectual Stand. Their Example, tho respectable,\r\nis not obligatory upon this House.--They lived in times, when the\r\nEncroachments of Despotism were in their Infancy.--They were carried\r\nto Salem, by the mere Caprice of Governor Burnet, who never pleaded an\r\nInstruction for doing this--An Instruction from a Ministry who had\r\nbefore treated them with unexampled Indignity--An Instruction which\r\nthey were not permitted to see. They had no Reason to apprehend a fixd\r\nDesign to alter the Seat of Government, to their great Inconvenience\r\nand the manifest Injury of the Province.\r\n\r\nWe are not disposd to dispute the Understanding, Integrity, Familys &\r\nEstates of the Council in 1728. We believe them to have been such,\r\nthat if they were now upon the Stage, they would see so many\r\nadditional & more weighty Reasons against proceeding to Business out\r\nof Boston, that they would fully approve of the Resolution of this\r\nHouse; as well as of what has been lately advancd by their Successors,\r\nwho are also Gentlemen of Understanding, Integrity, Fortune and\r\nFamily, in the following Words; \"Governor Burnets Conduct in convening\r\nthe General Court out of Boston, cannot be deemd an acknowlegd or\r\nconstitutional Precedent, because, it was not founded on the only\r\nReason on which the Prerogative of the Crown can be justly founded,\r\nThe Good of the Community.\" We shall only add, that the Rights of the\r\nprovince having been of late years most severely attackd, has inducd\r\nGentlemen to examine the Constitution more thorowly, & has increasd\r\ntheir Zeal in its Defence.\r\n\r\nYou are pleasd to adduce an Instance in 1754 in Addition to that in\r\n1747, which you say \"makes it probable, that the House of\r\nRepresentatives rather chose that the Court should sit elsewhere, when\r\na Comittee was chosen to consider of and report a proper place for a\r\nCourt House at a Distance from Boston\". We beg Leave here to observe,\r\nthat both these are Instances of the House's interresting themselves\r\nin this Affair, which your Honor now claims as a Prerogative: If the\r\nHouse were in no Case to have a Voice, or be regarded, in chusing a\r\nplace to hold the Court, how could they think of building a House in a\r\nplace, to which they never had been, and probably, never would be\r\ncalled.--\r\n\r\nWhile the House have been from time to time, holding up to View, the\r\ngreat Inconveniencys and manifest Injurys resulting from the Sitting\r\nof the Assembly at Cambridge, and praying a Removal to Boston, it is\r\nwith Pain that they have heard your Honor, instead of pointing out any\r\none good Purpose which can be answerd by it, replying that your\r\nInstructions will not permit you to remove the Court to Boston. By a\r\nroyal Grant in the Charter, in favor of the Commons of this province,\r\nthe Governor has the sole power of adjourning, proroguing and\r\ndissolving the General Court: And the Wisdom of that Grant appears in\r\nthis, that a person residing in the province, must be a more competent\r\nJudge, of the Fitness of the Time, and we may add, the place of\r\nholding the Court, than any person residing in Great Britain. We do\r\nnot deny, that there may be Instances when the Comander in Chiefe,\r\nought to obey the Royal Instructions: And should we also admit, that\r\nin ordinary Cases he ought to obey them, respecting the convening,\r\nholding, proroguing, adjourning & dissolving the General Court,\r\nnotwithstanding that Grant; yet we clearly hold, that whenever\r\nInstructions cannot by complyd with, without injuring the people, they\r\ncease to be binding. Any other Supposition would involve this\r\nAbsurdity in it, that a Substitute by Means of Instructions from his\r\nPrincipal, may have a greater Power than the Principal himself; or in\r\nother Words, that a Representative of a King who can do no Wrong, by\r\nmeans of Instructions may obtain a Right to do Wrong: for that the\r\nPrerogative extends not to do any Injury, never has and never can be\r\ndenyd. Therefore this House are clearly of Opinion, that your Honor is\r\nunder no Obligation to hold the General Court at Cambridge, let your\r\nInstructions be conceivd in Terms ever so peremptory, in as much as it\r\nis inconvenient and injurious to the province.--As to your Commission,\r\nit is certain, that no Clause containd in that, inconsistent with the\r\nCharter can be binding: To suppose, that when a Grant is made by\r\nCharter in favor of the people, Instructions shall supercede that\r\nGrant, and oblige the Governor to act repugnant to it, vacating the\r\nCharter at once, by the Breath of a Minister of State. Your Honor\r\nthinks you may safely say, \"there is not one of us, who if he was in\r\nyour Station, would venture to depart from the Instructions .\" As you\r\nhad not the least Shadow of Evidence to warrant this, we are sure you\r\ncould not say it with Safety: And we leave it with your Honor to\r\ndetermine, how far it is reconcileable with Delicacy to suggest it. In\r\nwhat particulars the holding the General Court at Cambridge is\r\ninjurious to us and the Province, has already been declared by the\r\nHouse, and must be too obvious to escape your Honors Observation. Yet\r\nyou are pleasd to tell us, that \"the Inconveniences can easily be\r\nremovd, or are so inconsiderable that a very small publick Benefit\r\nwill outweigh them\"--That they are not inconsiderable, every Days\r\nExperience convinces us; nor are our Constituents insensible of them:\r\nBut how they can be easily removd, we cannot conceive, unless by\r\nremoving the Court to Boston. Can the publick Offices & Records, to\r\nwhich we are under the Necessity of recurring, almost every Hour, with\r\nany Safety or Convenience to the publick be removd to Cambridge? Will\r\nour Constituents consent to be at the Expence of erecting a proper\r\nHouse at Cambridge, for accommodating the General Court, especially\r\nwhen they have no Assurance that the next Freak of a capricious\r\nMinister will not remove the Court to some other place? Is it possible\r\nto have that Communication with our Constituents, or to be benefited\r\nby the Reasonings of the people without Doors here, as at Boston? We\r\ncannot but flatter ourselves, that every judicious and impartial\r\nPerson will allow, that the holding the General Court at Cambridge, is\r\ninconvenient and hurtful to the Province; Nor has your Honor ever yet\r\nattempted to show a single Instance, in which the province can be\r\nbenefited by it: No good purpose which can be answerd by it, has ever\r\nyet been suggested by any one to this House. And we have the utmost\r\nConfidence, that our gracious Sovereign, has no Desire to hold the\r\nGeneral Court at any place inconvenient to its Members, or injurious\r\nto the province; but rather, that he will frown upon those, who have\r\nprocurd its Removal to such a place, or persist in holding it there.\r\n\r\nWe are not indeed sure, that the Ministry caused the Assembly to be\r\nremovd to Cambridge, in order to worry them into a Compliance with any\r\narbitrary Mandate, to the Ruin of our own or our Constituents\r\nLibertys: But we know, that the General Assembly has in Times past\r\nbeen treated with such Indignity and Abuse, by the Servants of the\r\nCrown, and a wicked Ministry may attempt it again.\r\n\r\nYour Honor observes, that \"the same Exception may be made to the Use\r\nof every other part of the prerogative, for every part is capable of\r\nAbuse.\" We shall never except to the proper Use of the prerogative: We\r\nhold it sacred as the Liberty of the Subject. But every Abuse of it,\r\nwill always be excepted to, so long as the Love of Liberty, or any\r\npublick Virtue remains. And whenever any other part of the prerogative\r\nshall be abusd, the House will not fail to judge for themselves of the\r\nGrievance, nor to exert every power with which the Constitution hath\r\nentrusted them, to check the Abuse, and redress the Grievance.\r\n\r\nThe House had expressd to your Honor their Apprehension of a fixd\r\nDesign, either to change the Seat of Government, or to harrass us, in\r\norder to bring us into Compliance with some arbitrary Mandate: Your\r\nHonor says, you know of no fixd Design to harrass us &c.: Upon which\r\nwe cannot but observe, that if you did not know of a fixd Design to\r\nchange the Seat of Governmt you would not have omitted so fair an\r\nOpportunity to satisfy the Minds of the House, in a Matter of such\r\nImportance to the Province. As to your very condescending and liberal\r\nProfessions, of exercising patience, or using Dispatch, as would be\r\nmost agreable to us, we shall be very much obligd to your Honor, for\r\nthe Exercise of those Virtues, whenever you shall see Cause to remove\r\nus to our ancient and established Seat: But these professions can be\r\nno Temptations to us, to give up our Privileges.\r\n\r\nYour Honor is pleasd to say, that \"we consider the Charter as a\r\nCompact between the Crown and the People of this province\" and to ask\r\na Question \"Shall one Party to the Compact be held, and not the\r\nother\"? It is true, we consider the Charter as such a Compact, and\r\nagree that both Parties are held. The Crown covenants, that a Great &\r\nGeneral Court shall be held, every last Wednesday in May for ever; The\r\nCrown therefore, doubtless is bound by this Covenant. But we utterly\r\ndeny, that the people have covenanted to grant Money, or to do\r\nBusiness, at least any other Business than chusing Officers and\r\nCouncellors to compleat the General Court, on the last Wednesday of\r\nMay, or in any other Day or Year whatever: Therefore this House, by\r\nrefusing to do Business, do not deprive the Crown of the Exercise of\r\nthe prerogative, nor fail of performing their part of the Compact.\r\nYour Honor wd doubtless have been culpable had you refusd to call a\r\nGeneral Court on the last Wednesday in May: And the House might have\r\nbeen equally culpable, if they had refusd to chuse a Speaker and\r\nClerk, or to elect Councellors, whereby to compleat the General Court;\r\nfor in Case of Omission in either part, a Question might arise,\r\nWhether the people would have a Legislature. When the General Assembly\r\nis thus formd, they are impowerd by the Charter, to make, ordain and\r\nestablish all Manner of wholesome and reasonable Orders, Laws,\r\nStatutes & Ordinances, Directions and Instructions, either with\r\npenaltys or without. But the Charter no where obliges the Genl Court,\r\nto make any Orders, Laws, Statutes or Ordinances, unless they, at that\r\ntime judge it conducive to the publick Good to make them: Much less\r\ndoes it oblige them to make any Laws &c, in any particular Session,\r\nyear or number of years, whenever they themselves shall judge them not\r\nto be for the publick Good. Such an Obligation would leave them the\r\nleast Color of Freedom, but reduce them to a mere machine; to the\r\nState the Parliament would have been in, if the Opinion of the two\r\nChiefe Justices and the three puisne Judges had prevaild in the Reign\r\nof Richard the second \"that the King hath the Governance of\r\nParliament, and may appoint what shall be first handled, and so\r\ngradually what next, in all matters to be treated of in parliament,\r\neven to the End of the parliament; and if any person shall act\r\ncontrary to the Kings pleasure made known therein, they are to be\r\npunishd as Traitors\"--for which opinion those five Judges had Judgment\r\nas in Case of high Treason.--Your Honor will allow us to ask, Whether\r\nthe Doctrine containd in your Question viz, \"If you should refuse to\r\ndo Business now you are met, would you not deprive the Crown of the\r\nExercise of the prerogative, and fail of performing your part of the\r\nCompact\" which implys a strong affirmation, is not in a Degree, the\r\nvery Doctrine of Chiefe Justice Tresilian and the four other Judges\r\njust now mentiond? By convening in Obedience to his Majesty's Writ,\r\ntested by your Honor, and again, at the time to which we are prorogud,\r\nwe have submitted to the prerogative, and performd our part of the\r\nCompact.\r\n\r\nThis House has the same inherent Rights in this Province, as the House\r\nof Commons has in Great Britain. It is our Duty to procure a Redress\r\nof Grievances, and we may constitutionally refuse to grant our\r\nConstituents money to the Crown, or to do any other Act of Government,\r\nat any given time, that is not affixd by Charter to a certain Day,\r\nuntil the Grievances of the people are redressd. We do not pretend,\r\nthat our Opinion is to prevail against his Majestys Opinion: We never\r\nshall attempt to adjourn or prorogue or dissolve the General Court:\r\nBut we do hope, that our Opinion shall prevail, against any Opinion\r\nwhatever, of the proper time to make Laws and to do Business. And by\r\nexerting this Power which the Constitution has given us, we hope to\r\nconvince your Honor and the Ministry of the Necessity of removing the\r\nCourt to Boston.--All judicious Men will allow that the proper time\r\nfor the House to do their part of the Business of the province, is for\r\nthe House to judge of and determine. The House think it is not, in the\r\npresent Circumstances of the province, a proper time to do this\r\nBusiness, while the Court is constraind to hold their Session out of\r\nBoston: Your Honor is of a different Opinion: We have conformd to this\r\nOpinion as far as the Constitution requires us, And now our right of\r\njudging commences. If your Honors or even his Majestys Opinion\r\nconcerning this Point is to prevail against the Opinion of the House,\r\nwhy may not the Crown, according to the Tresilian Doctrine, as well\r\nprescribe what Business we shall do, and in what Order.\r\n\r\nThe House is still ready to answer for all the ill Consequences which\r\ncan justly be attributed to them; nor are they sensible of any Danger\r\nfrom exerting the power which the Charter has given them of doing\r\ntheir part of the Business in their own time.--That the Province has\r\nEnemies who are continually defaming it, and their Charter, is\r\ncertain; that there are Persons who are endeavoring to intimidate the\r\nprovince from asserting and vindicating their just Rights and\r\nLiberties, by Insinuations of Danger to the Constitution, is also\r\nindisputable; But no Instance happend, even in the execrable Reign of\r\nthe worst of the Stuart Race, of a Forfeiture of a Charter, because\r\nany one Branch of a Legislature, or even because the whole Government\r\nunder the Charter, refusd to do Business at a particular time, under\r\ngrievous Circumstances of Ignominy, Disgrace and Insult; and when\r\ntheir Charter had explicitly given to that Government the sole power\r\nof judging of the proper Season & Occasion of doing Business.\r\n\r\nWe are obligd at this time to struggle, with all the Powers with which\r\nthe Constitution hath furnishd us, in Defence of our Rights; to\r\nprevent the most valueable of our Libertys, from being wrested from\r\nus, by the subtle Machinations, and daring Encroachments of wicked\r\nMinisters. We have seen of late, innumerable Encroachments on our\r\nCharter: Courts of Admiralty extended from the high Seas, where by the\r\nCompact in the Charter, they are confind, to numberless important\r\nCauses upon Land: Multitudes of civil Officers, the Appointment of all\r\nwhich is confind by Charter to the Governor and Council, sent here\r\nfrom abroad by the Ministry: A Revenue, not granted by us, but torn\r\nfrom us: Armys stationd here without our Consent; and the Streets of\r\nour Metropolis, crimsond with the Blood of our fellow\r\nSubjects.--These, and other Grievances and Cruelties, too many to be\r\nhere enumerated, and too melancholly to be much longer born by this\r\ninjurd People, we have seen brot upon us by the Devices of Ministers\r\nof State. We have seen & had of late, Instructions to Governors which\r\nthreaten to destroy all the remaining Privileges of our Charter. In\r\nJune 1768, the House, by an Instruction were orderd to rescind an\r\nexcellent Resolution of a former House, on pain of Dissolution;4 they\r\nrefusd to comply with so impudent a Mandate, and were dissolvd. And\r\nthe Governor, tho' repeatedly requested, and tho' the Exigences of the\r\nProvince demanded a General Assembly, refusd to call a new one, till\r\nthe following May. In the last year, the General Court was forcd to\r\ngive Way to regular Troops, illegally quarterd in the Town of Boston,\r\nin Consequence of Instructions to Crown Officers, and whose main Guard\r\nwas most daringly and insultingly placd at the Door of the State\r\nhouse; and afterwards they were constraind to hold their Session at\r\nCambridge. The present year the Assembly is summond to meet, and is\r\nstill continued there in a kind of Duress, without any Reason that can\r\nbe given--any Motive whatever, that is not as great an Insult to them,\r\nand Breach of their Privilege, as any of the foregoing.--Are these\r\nthings consistent with the Freedom of the House; or, could the General\r\nCourts tamely submiting to such Usage, be thought to promote his\r\nMajestys Service!\r\n\r\nShould these Struggles of the House prove unfortunate and ineffectual,\r\nthis Province will submit, with pious Resignation to the Will of\r\nProvidence; but it would be a kind of Suicide, of which we have the\r\nutmost Horror, thus to be made the Instruments of our Servitude.\r\n\r\nWe beg leave before we conclude, to make one Remark on what you say,\r\nthat \"our Compliance can be of no Benefit to our Sovereign, any\r\nfarther than as he interests himself in the Happiness of his\r\nSubjects.\" We are apprehensive that the World may take this for an\r\nInsinuation, very much to our Dishonor: As if the Benefit of our\r\nSovereign were a Motive in our Minds, against a Compliance. But as\r\nthis Imputation would be extremely unjust, so we hope it was not\r\nintended by your Honor. We are however obligd in Justice to our selves\r\nand our Constituents to declare that if we had Reason to believe, that\r\na Compliance would by any, the least Benefit to our Sovereign, it\r\nwould be a very powerful Argument with us; But we are on the Contrary,\r\nfully perswaded, that a Compliance at present, would be very injurious\r\nand detrimental to his Majestys Service.\r\n\r\n1From this point the manuscript is wholly in the handwriting of Adams.\r\n2Massachusetts State Papers, pp. 237-240.\r\n3Inaccurately quoted from T.

He who should not have\r\nemployed bad Men, or at least should have restrained or punished them,\r\nincurred the same Censure as if he himself had done it!--It is the\r\ncommon Craft of corrupt Ministers to represent their Cause as the\r\nCause of their Prince.\"\r\n\r\nHis Honor the Lieutenant Governor, in his late Reply2 to the House of\r\nRepresentatives, tells them, that \"a Secretary of State has by Virtue\r\nof his Office free Access\" to the King; & \"receives the Signification\r\nof his Majesty's pleasure\"; from whence he concludes that \"he will\r\ngive no directions but what he knows to be agreable thereto\", and\r\ntherefore \"every order coming from a Minister of State, must be\r\nsuppos'd to come immediately from the Crown\"--This is reasoning\r\nplausibly enough; but before I can give my full Assent to the\r\nConclusion, I must have good Grounds to believe this same Secretary to\r\nbe a Man of Wisdom and Integrity; a Character, which however\r\nrequisite, does not always belong to a Minister of State. If he is\r\ndeficient in both or either of these, we can have no Assurance, that\r\nevery Order coming from him is declaratory of the Pleasure of the\r\nSovereign: His want of Wisdom may render him altogether incapable of\r\nunderstanding the Mind of his royal Master; or, failing in point of\r\nIntegrity he may maliciously and traiterously pervert his benevolent\r\nIntentions for the Good of his Subjects. Whenever Orders are given by\r\na Secretary of State, that are evidently calculated to injure the\r\nPublick, we are by no Means to suppose them to come immediately from\r\nthe Crown, for the King can do no Wrong: Will his Honor have us\r\nbelieve that the King can do a weak & foolish, or a malevolent and\r\nwicked Act? If not, such Instructions are to be look'd upon as the\r\nacts of the Minister and not of the King. Ministers of state were\r\nformerly shields to the persons of Kings from such kind of\r\nimputations; but it is much to be feared, if care is not taken to\r\nprevent it, the idle whimsies of Ministers, their weakness and folly,\r\nor their daring and impudent attempts to destroy the Liberties of the\r\nPeople, will be attributed to a Cause which no one, to be sure at\r\npresent, will chuse to mention.--I hope his Honor's reasoning, and his\r\ncorrespondent Conduct, does not lead to this--The House of\r\nRepresentatives seem to be aware of the Danger of such Doctrine, when\r\nthey expressly say, \"They presume not to call in question the Wisdom\r\nof their Sovereign or the rectitude of his Intentions\"; at the same\r\ntime that they speak with a manly Freedom, of certain Instructions\r\nthat have come from Ministers of State, and even treat them with\r\nIndignity and Contempt. His Honor presumes \"they would not have done\r\nthis, if they had known it to be an Order from his Majesty.\" I believe\r\nthey would not; they saw reason to think that the Mandate to rescind\r\nin June 1768, was the mere act of a weak Minister; and as his Honor\r\ndoes not give the least Intimation, that he either knows or believes\r\nto the Contrary, I must beg leave to say, that in my poor Opinion, the\r\nEpithet given to it by the House, is neither \"coarse\" nor \"indecent.\"\r\n\r\nWe seem, Messrs. Printers, to be drawing very near the time, when some\r\npeople will be hardy enough to dispute, whether we are to be governed\r\naccording to the rule of the Constitution, the building of which has\r\nbeen the Work of Ages, or to use the words of the House, by the\r\n\"breath of a Minister of State.\"--Instructions, form'd by a set of\r\nMinisters, calculated for certain purposes and sent over to a\r\nGovernor, who to avoid their high Displeasure and the terrible Effects\r\nof it, must implicitly believe, or say he believes them, to come\r\nimmediately from the King; and the House of Representatives must by no\r\nmeans controvert them, lest, as Bernard once impudently told them,\r\nthey should be chargeable with \"oppugnation against the King's\r\nauthority.\"3\r\n\r\nThere is a sort of Impropriety, as I take it, in saying that every\r\nOrder from a Minister of State comes immediately from the Crown.\r\nHowever, little Inaccuracies in diction are not to be regarded in a\r\nperformance fraught with reason and sound argument: It is rather to be\r\nwondered at that we meet with so few Imperfections, since we are\r\nassured by his Honor that he had taken \"one Day only for his Reply\" to\r\nan Answer which he intimates cost a Committee of the House full Eight\r\nDays hard Labor.4 Some men are said to have intuitive knowledge; and\r\nsuch have nothing to do but write down pages of unanswerable reasons\r\nas fast as the Ink can flow.\r\n\r\nIt was doubtless from this opinion that \"every Order from a Secretary\r\nof State comes immediately from the King,\" or as his Honor elsewhere\r\nmore properly expresses it, is a 'Signification of his Majesty's\r\npleasure,' that he concludes it to be his Majesty's pleasure that he\r\nshould not communicate them; for such a prohibitory order is said to\r\ncome from the Secretary. But the House seemed to think it impossible\r\nthat our gracious King, should hold his Subjects to a blind obedience\r\nto Orders which they were not permitted to see; and therefore\r\nconcluded, and as I humbly conceive very justly, that this order in a\r\nparticular manner, was to be suppos'd to be an Act of the Minister and\r\nnot of the King--His Honor indeed speaks of it with great Veneration;\r\nand tells them that \"the restraint he is under appears to him to be\r\nfounded upon wise Reasons.\" But from this alone, he could not with\r\ncertainty conclude that the Order came immediately from the King; for\r\nit is undoubtedly his Honor's opinion, that the present set of\r\nMinisters are very wise men, tho' not so wise as his Majesty; and\r\ntherefore he might take it for granted, the Order was founded on wise\r\nreasons if it had come from them only. But as in these times of Light\r\nand Liberty, every man chuses to see and judge for himself, especially\r\nin all matters which are prescribed to him as rules of faith and\r\npractice; it is pity his Honor did not condescend to communicate those\r\nwise reasons, that the House and the People without Doors, here and\r\nthere \"a transient Person\" who may have a common share of\r\nunderstanding, might judge whether they appeared to them to be reasons\r\nbecoming the Wisdom of a King, or only as the House somewhere express\r\nit, \"the freaks of a capricious Minister of State.\"\r\n\r\nIf I have leisure I shall write you again.

The house of\r\nRepresentatives say, \"the province has suffer'd much by their unjust,\r\ngroundless and illegal opinions\"--2 Among other instances of weakness\r\nor wickedness in some persons who have filled these offices, I shall\r\nonly mention one which now occurs to my mind--There is an act of\r\nParliament which exempts seamen from an impress in America: This act\r\nwas upon several occasions urged by the Americans, and it has been the\r\nopinion of attornies and sollicitors general, at different times, that\r\nthe act was limitted to a time of war, when in truth there was no part\r\nor clause whatever in it to justify such opinion.--Well then may it be\r\ncalled a groundless opinion; and if groundless, will any one insist\r\nthat there was no defect in these instances in point of integrity, if\r\nnot of learning--Perhaps these opinions may appear to his Honor to be\r\nfounded upon wise reasons; but others who cannot see the force of\r\nthese reasons, have a right to think differently; and such a freedom\r\nis not likely to bring dishonor upon them--It is enough for those who\r\nare dependent upon the great for commissions, pensions, and the like,\r\nto preach up implicit faith in the great--Others whose minds are\r\nunfettered will think for themselves--They will not blindly adopt the\r\nopinions even of persons who are advanced to the first stations in the\r\ncourts of law and equity, any further than the reasons which they\r\nexpressly give are convincing.--They will judge freely of every point\r\nof state doctrine, & reject with disdain a blind submission to the\r\nauthority of mere names, as being equally ridiculous, as well as\r\ndangerous in government and religion.--It may have been, Messirs.\r\nPrinters, too much the practice of late, for some plantation\r\ngovernors, like Verres either ancient or modern, to oppress and plague\r\nthe people they were bound to protect, and, perhaps in obedience to\r\n\"orders that have come from secretaries of state\"--These orders truly\r\nwere to be treated with as profound veneration, without the least\r\nenquiry into their nature and tendency, as ever a poor deluded\r\nCatholic reverenc'd the decree of Holy Father at Rome.--While such a\r\ndisposition prevailed, O how orderly were the people, how submissive\r\nto government! But when once a statute or the constitution was\r\npleaded, which it was as dangerous for the people to look into, as it\r\nwould be for an Italian, after the example of the noble Bereans, to\r\nsearch the scriptures, the secretary of state was to be informed that\r\nthe people were become rebellious; as they said of St. Paul for\r\npreaching doctrines opposite to the humour of the Jewish Masters, that\r\nhe \"turned the world upside down\"--The whole ministerial cabal was\r\nsummoned; opinions were called for and taken--and however ludicrous,\r\nto say the best of them, those opinions were, if the people did not\r\nswallow them down as law & reason, they were told, that the freedom\r\nthey used with the characters of great men forsooth \"would bring\r\ndishonor upon them\" and standing armies were sent to convince them of\r\nthe reasonableness of these opinions--I confess that \"too great a\r\nrespect cannot be paid to the honorable part of the profession of the\r\nlaw,\" but when state-lawyers, attorneys and sollicitors general, &\r\npersons advanced to the highest stations in the courts of law,\r\nprostitute the honor of the profession, become tools of ministers, and\r\nemploy their talents for explaining away, if possible the Rights of a\r\nkingdom, they are then the proper objects of the odium and indignation\r\nof the public.--A very judicious author has observed that \"our\r\nmaladies and dangers have originated chiefly in the errors and\r\nmisconduct of ministers; who from defect of ability or fidelity, or\r\nboth, were unequal to the wants of a kingdom: A great genius, infinite\r\nknowledge and infinite care, says he, are requisite to form a prime\r\nminister; but youth and dissipation, with the trainings of the turf\r\nand the gaming table, will now suffice to make a man master of the\r\nmost difficult trade in the world, without learning it\"--Such were the\r\nmen, under whose Influence Attorneys and Sollicitors General, within\r\nthese fifty Years past, have held their places, and have even been\r\nadvanced to the highest Stations in the Courts of Law, without any\r\nother recommendation than a servile disposition to prostitute the Law\r\nand the Constitution, whenever their Masters should require it of\r\nthem--Such have been the Men, from whom Orders have come to Governors\r\nand Commanders in Chief, civil and military in America! And shall we\r\neasily be persuaded to take it for granted that such men are incapable\r\nof abusing the high trust reposed in them, and that Orders coming from\r\nthem are always to be considered as \"Significations of the pleasure of\r\nthe Sovereign.\"--\r\n\r\nYour's,\r\n\r\nA CHATTERER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE SIGNED \"A CHATTERER.\"\r\n\r\n[Boston Gazette, August 27, 1770.]\r\n\r\nMESSIEURS PRINTERS,\r\n\r\nI Find in the last Monday's Evening Post,1 a Piece, signed Probus; the\r\nIntention of which seems to be, at least in Part, to show that I must\r\nbe \"effectually disappointed in my Attempt to convince the World that\r\nI am a greater Scholar than the Lieutenant-Governor of this Province\"!\r\nNow upon the Word of a Chatterer, I declare to all my kind Readers, as\r\nwell as Hearers, that I never did make the least Pretension to\r\nScholarship; and besides, the World must long have been so fully\r\nconvinced of the \"profound Erudition\" of the Lieutenant-Governor of\r\nthis Province, that it would be the highest Degree of Vanity in any\r\nMan to think of rivaling him as a Scholar. It was obvious to common\r\nReaders that \"what comes from the King thro' his Minister, does not\r\ncome immediately from the King\"--And yet every Paper of the 6th of\r\nAugust led us to think that an \"Expression in itself repugnant and\r\nabsurd\", had, perhaps thro' Inadvertency, drop't even from a learned\r\nPen--So far was I from \"bravely attacking the Word immediately,\" or\r\n\"entering into a formal Criticism,\" or any Criticism at all, that I\r\nbut barely mentioned it as a \"little inaccuracy\"; at the same Time\r\nmaking the best Apology I could for it, by saying that as his Honor\r\nhad assured us he \"had taken one Day only for his Reply\" it was rather\r\nto be wonder'd at, that we met with so few Imperfections of that kind.\r\nBut Probus has rectify'd the Mistake, and Probus has vindicated the\r\nLt. Governor of this Province as a Scholar.--We Chatterers, Messrs.\r\nPrinters, have as much Pretension to the Character of the Gentleman,\r\nas any such formal and grave kind of folks as Probus: But I did not\r\nthink myself under any obligation \"as a Gentleman or an honest Man\" to\r\nhunt after the Original, and therefore I have no Acknowlegment to make\r\nto any one for \"a faulty Neglect in not seeing it before my\r\nPublication.\" I suppos'd, as any one might, that the printed Copies\r\nwere agreable to the original; and, that our Enemies may not avail\r\nthemselves of the common Artifice, in representing the Advocates for\r\nthe People as endeavoring to deceive the public I do again declare,\r\nthat \"in my Conscience I thought the printed Copy to be genuine\"; and\r\nI hereby bear my Testimony, as far as that will go, against any Abuse\r\nbeing offered to Probus, which, poor Man, he either is, or affects to\r\nbe under Apprehensions of, for rectifying this Mistake: But as few\r\npersons beside his Honor the Pope, lay Claim to Infallibility, upon\r\ndue Consideration it seemeth not, that I am guilty of such high Crime\r\nand Misdeameanour, as by any Rule in Law to be subjected to Indictment\r\nor ex officio Information. However, I think it incumbent on you to\r\nsuffer your Readers to be advertiz'd, that instead of immediately in\r\nhis Honor's Reply to the House of Representatives, as published in\r\nyour Paper of the 6th of August, they ought to read mediately; which\r\nmay prevent some other Chatterer from rudely attempting to convince\r\nthe World that he is \"a greater Scholar than the Lt. Governor of this\r\nProvince;\" Such an attempt perhaps may otherwise be made at a Distance\r\nwhere Probus may not have it in his Power to set right this notable\r\nMistake--The Word being thus restored, the Passage will remain just as\r\nliable to the Chatterer's Exception, notwithstanding all that Probus\r\nhas said, as if it stood as it did; for the whole that was intended,\r\nwas, to show, that we ought to take the Characters of Ministers of\r\nState into Consideration, before we conclude, as his Honor would have\r\nus, that every Order from them comes mediately from the Crown, or is a\r\nSignification of his Majesty's Pleasure.\r\n\r\nThere is in the same Evening Post, as well as the Boston Post-Boy &\r\nAdvertiser,2 & also in the Gazette of Thursday last, an Advertisement\r\nwherein the same Notice is taken of this Assault and Battery of mine\r\nupon the Scholarship of the Lieutenant Governor of this Province--I am\r\nsorry that my poor Publication, which seems after all to be of no more\r\nSignificancy in their Opinion than \"a Man of Straw\" has given so great\r\nUneasiness to some of his Honor's Friends--This Advertiser indirectly\r\nchargeth me with Indecency in \"undertaking to answer a Governor's\r\nMessage.\" Now I did not undertake to anwer a Governor's Message; and\r\nto speak plain, I did not think it worth while to undertake it--I\r\nbelieve I am not alone in the Opinion, that some messages might easily\r\nbe answered, & possibly each in \"one Day only\": But if I had\r\nundertaken it, where in the Name of common sense would have been the\r\nIndecency of it? I know very well that it has been handed as a\r\npolitical Creed of late, that the Reasoning of the People without\r\nDoors is not to be regarded--But every \"transient Person\" has a Right\r\npublickly to animadvert upon whatever is publickly advanc'd by any\r\nMan, and I am resolv'd to exercise that Right, when I please, without\r\nasking any Man's Leave--And moreover, I am free to say, that if ever a\r\nGovernor's Message should happen to be below the Attention of a\r\nScholar, no Person can more aptly take Notice of it, that I know of,\r\nthan\r\n\r\nA CHATTERER.\r\n\r\n\r\n1The Boston Evening Post, published by T. & J.

What\r\nwould be the feelings of our fellow-subjects in Britain, if contrary\r\nto their Bill of Rights, and indeed to every principle of civil\r\ngovernment, soldiers were posted even in their captial, without the\r\nconsent of their Parliament? And yet the subjects of the same Prince\r\nin America who are entitled to the same freedom, are compelled to\r\nsubmit to as great a military power as administration shall please to\r\norder to be posted among them in a time of profound peace, without the\r\nconsent of their assemblies! And this military power is allowed to\r\ntrample upon the laws of the land, the common security, without\r\nrestraint! Such an instance of absolute uncontroul'd military tyranny\r\nmust needs be alarming, to those who have before in some measure\r\nenjoy'd, and are still entitled to the blessings of a free government,\r\nhaving never forfeited the character of loyal subjects.--After the\r\nfatal tragedy of the fifth of March, the regiments under the command\r\nof Lieut. Colonel Dalrymple were removed from the Town of Boston to\r\nthe Barracks on Castle Island, in consequence of a petition from the\r\ntown to the Lieutenant Governor and his Prayer to the Colonel; since\r\nwhich, in pursuance of Instruction to the Lieut. Governor, the\r\ngarrison there in the pay of the province, is withdrawn, and a\r\ngarrison of his Majesty's regular troops placed in their stead. And\r\nalthough this exchange is made ostensively by the immediate order of\r\nthe lieutenant-governor, yet it appears by the inclosed depositions,\r\nthat Col. Dalrymple in reality took the custody and government of the\r\nfortress by order of general Gage; and therefore the lieutenant\r\ngovernor has no longer that command, which he is vested with by the\r\nroyal charter.\r\n\r\nWe cannot help observing upon this occasion, that the instructions\r\nwhich have of late been given to the governor, some of them at least,\r\ndirectly militate, as in the present instance, with the charter of the\r\nprovince; And these instructions are not always adapted to promote his\r\nMajesty's service, or the good of the people within this province, but\r\noften appear to be solely calculated to further and execute the\r\nmeasures, and enforce the laws of a different state; by which means\r\nhis Majesty's colonies may be entirely subjected to the absolute will\r\nof his other subjects in Great Britain, for which there can be no\r\npretence of right, but what is founded in mere force.--By virtue of\r\ntheir positive instructions, the general assembly of the province has\r\nbeen remov'd from its ancient establish'd and only convenient seat in\r\nBoston, and is still obliged to hold its session at Harvard College in\r\nCambridge, to the great inconvenience of the members and injury of the\r\npeople, as well as detriment of that seminary of learning, without any\r\nreason that can be assigned but will and pleasure: And thus the\r\nprerogative of the King, which is a trust reposed in him to be\r\nimproved only for the welfare of his subjects, is perverted to their\r\nmanifest injury.\r\n\r\nAnd what is still more grievous is, that the Governor of the province\r\nis absolutely inhibited, as we are told, from laying before the\r\nassembly any instruction, which he receives, even such as carry in\r\nthem the evident marks of his Majesty's displeasure: By which means\r\nthe House of Representatives cannot have it in their power to obtain\r\nhere, that precise knowledge of the grounds of our Sovereign's\r\ndispleasure, which we are in reason and justice entitled to, nor can\r\nthe ministry be made responsible for any measures they may advise to\r\nin order to introduce and establish an illegal and arbitray government\r\nover his Majesty's subjects in the colonies.--We have an instance of\r\nthis kind now before us; the Lt. Governor of the province having in\r\nhis speech at the opening of this session, given a dark intimation of\r\nsomething intended against the province, and when the House of\r\nRepresentatives earnestly desired him to explain it, that they might\r\nhave a clear understanding of what was inteded therein, he declared as\r\nhe had before done in other like cases, that he was not at liberty to\r\nmake public or to communicate by speech or message an order from his\r\nMajesty in council which he had received, although in consequence\r\nthereof the state of the province was to be laid before parliament. By\r\nsuch conduct in the ministry it appears that we may be again accus'd\r\nand censur'd by parliament as we have heretofore been, and perhaps\r\nsuffer the greatest injury without knowing our accusers or the matters\r\nthat may be alleg'd against us.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, by an order of parliament that the names of persons\r\ngiving intelligence to the ministry which may at any time be laid\r\nbefore parliament, shall be made secret even to the members\r\nthemselves, the greatest encouragement is given to persons inimical to\r\nthe province, to send home false relations of speeches and proceedings\r\nin public assemblies, and elsewhere, containing injurious charges upon\r\nindividuals as well as publick bodies: Some of which have been\r\ntransmitted home under the seal of the province, without the least\r\nnotice given to those individuals, or any but the few in the secret to\r\nattend and cross-examine such witnesses. Thus even parliament itself\r\nmay be misled into measures highly injurious and destructive to the\r\nprovince, by the calumny and detraction of those who are not and\r\ncannot be known, and whose falsehoods cannot therefore be\r\ndetected.--So wretched is the state of this province, not only to be\r\nsubjected to absolute instructions, given to the governor to be the\r\nrule of his administration, whereby some of the most essential clauses\r\nof our charter, vesting in him powers to be exercis'd for the good of\r\nthe people are totally rescinded, which in reality is a state of\r\ndespotism; but also, to a standing army, which being uncontroul'd by\r\nany authority within the province, must soon tear up the very,\r\nfoundations of civil government.\r\n\r\nMoreover we have the highest reason to complain that since the late\r\nparliamentary regulations of the colonies, the jurisdiction of the\r\ncourt of admiralty has been extended to so enormous a length, as\r\nitself to threaten the very being of the constitution: By the statute\r\n4th Geo. 3 chap. 15, \"All forfeitures and penalties inflicted by this\r\nor any other act of parliament relating to the trade and plantations\r\nin America which shall be incur'd there, may be prosecuted, sued for\r\nand recovered in any court of admiralty in the said colonies.\" Thus a\r\nsingle judge, independent of the people, and in a civil law court, is\r\nto try these extraordinary forfeitures and penalties without a jury:\r\nWhereas the same stature provides, that all penalties and forfeitures\r\nwhich shall be incurred in Great Britain, shall be prosecuted, sued\r\nfor and recovered in any of his Majesty's courts of record, in\r\nWestminster or in the court of exchequer in Scotland respectively.\r\nHere is the most unreasonble and unjust distinction, made between the\r\nsubjects in Britain and America; as tho' it were designed to exclude\r\nus from the least share in that clause of Magna-Charta, which has for\r\nmany centuries been the noblest bulwark of the English liberties, &\r\nwhich cannot be too often repeated; \"No freeman shall be taken or\r\nimprison'd or disseiz'd of his freehold, or liberties, or free\r\ncustoms, or be outlaw'd, or exil'd, or any otherwise destroyed, nor\r\nwill we pass upon him nor condemn him, but by the judgment of his\r\npeers or the law of the land.\"\r\n\r\nThese are some of the insupportable grievances which this province has\r\nlong been laboring under, and which still remain altogether\r\nunredressed: For although they have been set forth in the clearest\r\nmanner by humble petitions to the throne, yet such an ascendency over\r\nus have the officers of the crown here in the minds of administration,\r\nthat our complaints are scarcely heard; our very petitions are deemed\r\nfactious, and instead of obtaining any relief, our oppressions have\r\nbeen more aggravated, & we have reason to apprehend will be still\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nFor by the best intelligence from England, we are under strong\r\napprehensions that by virtue of an act of parliament of the 7 Geo.3.2\r\nwhich impowers his Majesty to appropriate a part of the revenue raised\r\nin America, for the support of civil government, and the\r\nadministration of justice in such colonies where he shall judge it\r\nnecessary, administration is determined to bestow large salaries upon\r\nthe attorney-general, judges and governor of this province; whereby\r\nthey will be made not only altogether independent of the people, but\r\nwholly dependent upon the ministry for their support. These\r\nappointments will be justly obnoxious to the other colonies, and tend\r\nto beget and keep up a perpetual discontent among them; for they will\r\ndeem it unjust as well as unnecessary to be oblig'd to bear a part of\r\nthe support of government in this province, and even in the courts of\r\nlaw; especially if designs are also meditating to make other important\r\nalterations in our Charter, by appointing the Council from home, &c.\r\nwhereby the executive will be rendered absolute, and the legislative\r\ntotally ineffectual to any valuable purpose. The assembly is in all\r\nreason sufficiently dependent already upon the Crown: The one branch\r\nannually for its being, as it is subject to the negative of the\r\nGovernor; and both the branches for every grant and appropriation of\r\ntheir money, and also for their whole defence and security, as he is\r\nCaptain-General, and has by Charter the sole military command within\r\nthe province: All civil officers are either nominated and appointed by\r\nhim with the advice and consent of his Majesty's Council, or if\r\nelected they are subject to his negative: And our laws, after being\r\nconsented to by his Majesty's Governor, are by the first opportunity\r\nfrom the making thereof, to be transmitted to his Majesty for his\r\napprobation or disallowance: Three years they are subject to the\r\nrevision of the crown lawyers in Britain, who my always be strangers\r\nto our internal polity, & sometimes disaffected to us: And at any time\r\nwithin the three years, His Majesty in his privy council may, if he\r\nthinks proper, reject them, and then they become utterly void. Surely\r\nthe parliament of Great Britain cannot wish for greater checks, both\r\nupon the legislative and executive of a colony, unless we are to be\r\nconsidered as bastards and not Sons.--A step further will reduce us to\r\nabsolute subjection. If administration is resolved to continue such\r\nmeasure of severity, the colonies will in time consider the\r\nmother-state as utterly regardless of their welfare: Repeated acts of\r\nunkindness on one side, may by degrees abate the warmth of affection\r\non the other, and a total alienation may succeed to that happy union,\r\nharmony and confidence, which has subsisted, and we sincerely wish may\r\nalways subsist: If Great Britain, instead of treating us as their\r\nfellow-subjects, shall aim at making us their vassals and slaves, the\r\nconsequence will be, that although our merchants have receded from\r\ntheir non-importation agreement, yet the body of the people will\r\nvigorously endeavor to become independent of the mother-country for\r\nsupplies, and sooner than she may be aware of it, will manufacture for\r\nthemselves. The colonists, like healthy young sons, have been\r\nchearfully building up the parent state, and how far Great Britain\r\nwill be affected, if they should be rendered even barely useless to\r\nher, is an object which we conceive is at this very juncture worth the\r\nattention of a British Parliament.\r\n\r\nYour own acquaintance with this province, and your well known\r\nattachment to it, will lead you to exert all your powers in its\r\ndefence: And as the Council have made choice of William Bollan, Esq;\r\nfor their agent, you will no doubt confer with him, and concert such\r\nmeasures as will promote our common interest: Your abilities we\r\ngreatly confide in; but if you shall think it for the advantage of the\r\nprovince to consult with and employ council learned in the law, the\r\nimportance of your agency will be a motive sufficient for us to\r\nacquiesce in such expence on that account, as your own judgment shall\r\ndictate to you to be necessary.\r\n\r\nIncluded are the proceedings of his Majesty's Council of this\r\nprovince, upon an affidavit of Mr. Secretary Oliver, which this House\r\napprehend has a tendency to make a very undue impression on the minds\r\nof his Majesty's ministers and others, respecting the temper and\r\ndisposition of the people, previous to the tragical transaction of the\r\nfifth of March last: You are therefore desired to make such use of\r\nthem as shall prevent such unhappy consequences from taking effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n1Attributed to Adams by Governor Hutchinson.

I return the Letters signd\r\nJunius Americanus deliverd to me by Mr Cary,4 by your direction to be\r\na valueable present. The Author has servd the American Cause in a\r\nmanner in which I have long wishd some able pen would have undertaken\r\nto do it by appealing to the good Sense of the Body of the Nation. I\r\nbelieve the general Inclination there is to wish that we may preserve\r\nour Liberties; and perhaps even the Ministry could for some Reasons\r\nfind it in their hearts to be willing that we shd be restord to the\r\nState we were in before the passing of the Stamp Act, were it not that\r\na Set of detestable Men were continually writing from hence that we\r\nshd carry our Claims still higher & there wd be no Bounds to our\r\nDemands. I can venture to assure you that there is no Foundation for\r\nsuch Assertions, nor do I think they are really believd by any. The\r\nPeople here are indeed greatly tenacious of their just Rights & I hope\r\nin God they will ever firmly maintain them. Every Attempt to enforce\r\nthe plan of Despotism will certainly irritate them; While they have a\r\nSense of freedom they will oppose the Efforts of Tyranny; and altho\r\nthe Mother Country may at present boast of her Superiority over them,\r\nshe may perhaps find the Want of that Superiority, when by repeated\r\nprovocations she shall have totally lost their Affections.--All Good\r\nMen surely wish for a cordial Harmony between the two Countrys. Great\r\nBritain can lose Nothing which she ought to retain by restoring the\r\nAmericans to their former State, & they I am satisfied will no further\r\ncontend; While the Struggle continues Manufactures will still increase\r\nin America in spite of all Efforts to prevent it; & how far Britain\r\nwill be injurd by it, ought certainly to be well considerd on your\r\nside the Atlantick.\r\n\r\nOur Merchants have receded from their Nonimportation Agreement. They\r\nheld it much longer than I ever thought they would or could. It was a\r\ngrand Tryal which pressd hard upon their private Interest. But the\r\nLandholders find it for their Interest to manufacture and it is their\r\nhappy Consideration that while they are most effectually serving their\r\nCountry they are adding to their private fortunes. The representatives\r\nof the people have this day agreed to promote Manufactures in their\r\nrespective Towns, & the House have appointed a special Committee5 to\r\nform a plan for the effectual Encouragement of Arts Agriculture\r\nManufactures & Commerce in this province; & even the Administration of\r\na Bernard could not tend more to sharpen the Edge of resentment which\r\nwill perpetually keep alive the Spirit of Manufactures than that which\r\nwe are now blessd with. Lt Governor Hutchinson, more plausible indeed\r\nthan Bernard, seems resolvd to push the same plan & the people plainly\r\nsee that a Change of Men is not likely to produce a Change of\r\nMeasures--so soon are the Words of the one verified when he said of\r\nthe other that he could rely upon him as he could on himself.\r\n\r\nOur House of Representatives have been inducd to do Business this\r\nSession, against their former remonstrances, principally from a\r\nNecessity which they apprehended they were under of attending to what\r\nmt be doing on your Side the Water. They accordingly chose an Agent. I\r\ngave my Suffrage with about a third part of the House, for Dr Lee--but\r\nDr Franklin being personally known to many of the Members had the\r\npreference--both the Gentlemen were highly spoken of in the House, &\r\nafterwards Dr Lee was appointed to the Trust, by a very full vote in\r\nCase of the Death or Absence of Dr Franklin.\r\n\r\nOur State Tryals as we may call them have at length come on. Preston\r\nis acquitted by a Jury!6 It is to be remarkd that the Baker of the\r\nRegiment, who indeed wd have had himself excusd, and three others were\r\nput on as Talesmen Preston having challengd Eighteen. One of the three\r\nwas a known Intimate of Prestons and another had declared before that\r\nif he was to be of the Jury he wd sit till Doomsday before he wd\r\nconsent to a Verdict agt him. Evidence to prove that the Soldiers were\r\nthe Aggressors of which there was plenty was not admitted. The main\r\nQuestion was whether he orderd the Men to fire--diverse persons swore\r\npositively that he did, but they differing about the Circumstance of\r\nhis Dress, & others swearing, one that he was very near him & did not\r\nhear him give the orders, & others that some other person unknown gave\r\nthem, operated in his favor. But no Weight that I can learn was given,\r\nto full proof that he led the Soldiers armd with loaded Musquets &\r\nBayonets. This he had a Right, nay it was his Duty to do, because the\r\nCentinel was in Danger & we must presume the People were the\r\nAggressors. This Principle I suppose will clear the Soldiers whose\r\nTryals begin on Tuesday next.7 Richardson who was convicted of the\r\nMurder of young Snider so long ago as March, remains unhangd, the\r\nCourt not having yet determind upon his Motion for another Tryal. You\r\nmay easily observe that we have catchd the impartial Spirit of the\r\nKings friends, a synonimous term for friends of Govt here, from the\r\nMother Country. I had not the opportunity of attending Prestons Tryal,\r\nbut am in hopes of having a minute Accot of it from a sensible\r\nGentleman who was present--if I can obtain it I will write you more\r\nprecisely upon the Subject.\r\n\r\nBefore I conclude I must mention to you that the Minister has taken a\r\nMethod which in my Opinion has a direct tendency to set up a despotism\r\nhere, or rather is the thing it self--and that is by sending\r\nInstructions to the Governor to be the rule of his Administration &\r\nforbiding him as the Govr declares to make them known to us, the\r\nDesign of which may be to prevent his ever being made responsible for\r\nany measures he may advise in order to introduce & establish arbitrary\r\npower over the Colonies. Mr Hutchinson has pushd this point with all\r\nthe Vigour of Bernard, which has occasiond warm messages between him &\r\nthe Assembly as you may observe in the Boston Gazette for several\r\nWeeks past. But of this I shall be more particular in my next.\r\n\r\nI shall be proud of an epistolary Correspondence with you, and with Dr\r\nLee to whom tho personally unknown to him I beg you wd make my\r\nCompliments. I am with strict truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n1A resident of London, and at one time sheriff; his relations with the\r\ncolonists appear in the letters printed in this volume.\r\n2A copy is in S. A.

And\r\nshould any Amendments in, or Addition to the Laws for regulating the\r\nMilitia of this Province be thought needful, at the next Session of\r\nthe General Court the House of Representatives will chearfully do all\r\nin their Power towards putting the Militia on a respectable Footing.\r\n\r\n1On November 19, 1770, Samuel Adams was appointed a member of a\r\ncommittee to draft a message to the Lieutenant Governor with reference\r\nto the vacancies in the militia. On the following day Adams reported\r\nto the House a draft, which was accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE SIGNED “A TORY.”\r\n\r\n[Boston Gazette, November 26, 1770.]\r\n\r\nI have thought of several things that have taken place since the\r\npresent a-----n1 began, which must needs have given sensible pleasure\r\nto every friend of this province, and possibly were alluded to in a\r\nlate pr-----n.2 ---In the first place, the friends of government have\r\nso far prevailed against the faction, as to get the non-importation\r\nplan broke thro’, which had for so long time embarrassed the Ministry\r\nin thier laudable efforts to ESTABLISH A REVENUE in the colonies. The\r\nconsequence of this, it is hoped, will be, that the worthy\r\nCommissioners of the customs will be continued; and the troops which\r\nhave so eminently protected the lives, and reformed the morals of the\r\npeople, will be reinstated; so that the well-affected may enjoy their\r\nplaces and PENSIONS without molestation from the vulgar. In the next\r\nplace, our Castle-William is taken out of the hands of the rude\r\nnatives, and put under the government of regular forces; this was an\r\nadmirable manoeuvre, which has occasioned the highest joy in the\r\nfriends of government, (thank his ----- for it) and in proportion\r\ndamp’d the spirits of the faction. And then, such a grand appearance\r\nof tall ships of war in our capital harbour, which were certainly\r\ndesigned to show us the marks of the greatest respect, (for what other\r\nend could the wise ministry have had in view) and may serve to make\r\nup for the loss of troops, if we should unfortunately not be favoured\r\nwith more! --There is also the advantage which his H----r the Lt.\r\nG-----r must reap from some late instructions, which, no doubt, “are\r\nfounded in wise reasons,” whereby the great defects in our Charter,\r\nwhich the friends of government have been long complaining of, may\r\nbe supply’d. --I might mention also, a late remarkable deliverance\r\nfrom death and danger, (blessed a-m-----n!) for it would have been a\r\ngreat discouragement to the efforts of government. --But no more--\r\nthese may be thought to be matters of great thankfulness, and may\r\nsuitably employ our minds at the approaching solemnity.\r\n\r\nYour’s\r\n\r\nA TORY.\r\n\r\nCambridge, Nov. 20, 1770.\r\n\r\n1Administration.\r\n2Proclamation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PETER TIMOTHY1\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBoston Novr 21 1770\r\n\r\nSIR\r\n\r\nEver since I recd your favr of Sept 222 I have been incessantly\r\nemployd in the Genl Assembly which met AGREABLE TO INSTRUCTIONS at\r\nHar[vard] Coll[ege] in Cam[bridge]. This I hope will be some Apology\r\nfor my not acknowleging it before.\r\n\r\nI had recd a Letter from Mr John Neufville Chairman of the Come of\r\nMerchts in Charlestown, inclosing Letters for the Sons of Liberty in\r\nBoston Connecticutt & N Hampshire. The two last of which I forwarded\r\nas soon as possible to such Gentn in the repsective places as I judgd\r\nworthy so excellent a Character. That which was directed for Boston\r\nI unseald, professing my self a Son of Liberty but found it was\r\ndesignd for the Trade, with whom I was not connected, but as an\r\nAuxiliary in their Nonimportaton Agreement. I therefore deliverd it\r\nto the Chairman of the Come here, and it was read with very great\r\nApprobation, in a large Meeting of the Body of the people. I desire\r\nyou wd make my Compts and Apology to Mr Neufville. I verily believd\r\nthat the Come of Merchants had duly honord his Letter by returning\r\nan Answer to it, as they had orderd it to be publishd in our papers;\r\nand I candidly suppose they had the same Expectation from me which\r\nmay be the occasion that the Letter remaind unanswerd.\r\n\r\nThe Nonimportation Agreemt since the Defection of New York is entirely\r\nat an end. From the Begining I have been apprehensive it wd fall\r\nshort of our Wishes. It was continued much beyond my Expectation:\r\nThere are here & I suppose every where, men interrested enough to\r\nrender such a plan abortive. Thro the Influence of the Come & Tories\r\nhere, Boston had been made to APPEAR in an odious Light; but I wd\r\nnot have you believe it to be the true Light. The Merchts in general\r\nhave punctually abode by their Agreemt, to their very great private\r\nloss; Some few have found means to play a dishonorable Game without\r\nDetection, tho the utmost pains have been taken. The Body of the\r\npeople remaind firm till the Merchts receded. I am very sorry that\r\nthe Agreemt was ever enterd into as it has turnd out ineffectual.\r\nLet us then ever forget that there has been such a futile\r\nCombination, & awaken our Attention to our first grand object. Let\r\nthe Colonies still convince their implacable Enemies, that they are\r\nunited in constitutional Principles, and are resolvd they WILL NOT be\r\nSlaves; that their Dependance is not upon Merchts or any particular\r\nClass of men, nor is their dernier resort, a resolution BARELY to\r\nwithhold Commerce, with a nation that wd subject them to despotic\r\nPower. Our house of reps[sic] have appointed a Come to correspond\r\nwith our friends in the other Colonies,3 & AMERICAN MANUFACTURES shd\r\nbe the constant Theme.\r\n\r\nOur young men seem of late very ambitious of making themselves\r\nmasters of the art MILITARY.\r\n\r\n1Of Charleston, South Carolina.\r\n2Asking why an earlier letter of the Charleston committee had not\r\nbeen answered.

But being afterwards told by a Friend of yours that\r\nyou were desirous yourself that Dr Lee might be chosen, which by no\r\nmeans lessened my Opinion of your Merit, & having also a great\r\nOpinion of Dr Lee, I thought myself happy in a Conclusion that your\r\nInclination perfectly coincided with my own Judgment. At the same\r\ntime, such was my Opinion of your honest Zeal for the Rights of\r\nAmerica and of your Ability to defend them that I could with equal\r\nSatisfaction have voted for Mr Sayer. I am perfectly of your Opinion\r\nthat no man shd be the object of our Choice who holds any place at\r\nthe Will of the present Administration; how far the House have been\r\ninfluencd by this Principle you are able to judge.\r\n\r\nYou will observe by the inclosd papers, to how great a degree\r\nministerial Instructions are enforcd here. They not only prescribe to\r\nthe Assembly which ought to be free the forms of Legislation in the\r\nmost essential Parts, but even annihilate the Powers of the Govr\r\nvested in him by Charter.3 Could it possibly be imagind that a man\r\nwho is bone of our Bone, & flesh of our flesh--who boasts that his\r\nAncestors were of the first Rank & figure in the Country, who has had\r\nall the Honors lavishly heapd upon him which his Fellow Citizens had\r\nit in their power to bestow, who with all the Arts of personal\r\nAddress professes the strongest Attachmt to his native Country & the\r\nmost tender feeling for its Rights. Could it be imagind htat such a\r\nMan shd be so lost to all sense of Gratitude & publick Love, as to aid\r\nthe Designs of despotick power for the sake of rising a single step\r\nhigher.\r\n\r\n“Who would not weep if such a Man there be\r\nWho would not weep if H-----n were he.”\r\n\r\nAut Caesar aut nullus, is inscribd on the Hearts of some Men who have\r\nneither Caesars Learning nor Courage. Caesar three times refusd the\r\nCrown; His Heart & his Tongue evidently gave each other the Lye. Our\r\nmodern GREAT MAN, would fain have it thought that he has refusd a\r\nGovernment, which his Soul is every day panting after & without the\r\nPossesion of which his Ambition & Lust of Power will perpetually\r\ntorment him.\r\n\r\nThe Intelligence in Your Letter of the 18 Sept which I have just now\r\nwith pleasure receivd, does not at all surprize me--”His former\r\nLetters” “wrote before Bernard embarkd for England” “have been equally\r\noppugnant to the Form of your Govt”--And yet this very Man gives out,\r\nthat in six months, the Province will be convincd that his Letters are\r\nwritten in defence of our Charter! So I remember Bernard himself, not\r\nlong before his own Letters returnd, declard to both Houses of\r\nAssembly, that if he was at Liberty to make publick the Letters he had\r\nwritten to the several Boards in favor of the Province, his Enemies\r\nwd blush.--Why does not this Man make his Letters publick? Would not\r\na Roman Senator have seizd the opportunity of appeasing the Jealousys\r\nof the angry Citizens? But the Body of the people are contemptible.4\r\nThis People who know not the Law are accursed, said a haughty Jewish\r\npriest. It has been his Principle from a Boy, that Mankind are to be\r\ngovernd by the discerning few--and it has ever since been his\r\nAmbition to be the Hero5 of the few.\r\n\r\nI have long since been of your Opinion that few great Men in Britain\r\nare entitled to an American Confidence--They will all in their Turns\r\nclamour for us while it is their Interest so to do.--It is the\r\nBusiness of America to take Care of herself--her salvation as you\r\njustly observe depends upon her own Virtue. Arts & Manufactures aided\r\nby Commerce have raised Great Britain to its present Pitch of\r\nGrandeur. America will avail herself by imitating her. We have already\r\nseen her troops and AS WE HAVE A PROSPECT OF A WAR I hope I may safely\r\ntell you that our YOUNG MEN begin to be ambitious of making themselves\r\nperfect Masters of the Art MILITARY. Amidst the innumerable Evils\r\nwhich we complain of from the bad policy of YOUR Ministry, this is\r\nthe happy Effect of Britains transplanting her Arms in America.\r\n\r\n1The prorogation, on November 20, was until January 23, 1771; the next\r\nsession actually began April 3, 1771.\r\n2Delivered by Richard Cary.

I did not write--but it was owing to incessant Avocations at\r\nCambridge & not to an unmindfulness of my promise or a Want of\r\nInclination to fulfil it. I hope ere now you are safe arrivd.

Ibid.\r\n\r\nMessieurs PRINTERS,\r\n\r\nSome time ago I took the liberty of making a few remarks in my poor\r\nmanner, upon a SPEECH deliver’d at the close of a session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly: I then thought, and still think that I had good\r\nright and lawful authority so to do, notwithstanding the rebuke which\r\nthe VENERABLE Mr. Probus1 then “thought fit” to give me. In imitation\r\nof some of my BRETHREN, I solemnly warned my readers, by way of\r\napplications, of the danger of certain INSTRUCTIONS, or as they were\r\nterm’d, “MINISTERIAL MANDATES” we had about that time been told of;\r\nwhich appear’d to me to be equal to that of REVENUE ACTS, or STANDING\r\nARMIES to ENFORCE them: I little thought that these instructions, or\r\nmandates, call them what you will, would in their effects have made\r\nso rapid a progress, in so short a time, as I find they have since\r\nTHE PRESENT ADMINISTRATION began: For I perceive that our house of\r\nrepresentatives have plainly told the Lt. Governor that “merely in\r\nobedience to INSTRUCTIONS, he has made an ABSOLUTE SURRENDER of Castle\r\nWilliam to his Majesty’s forces, with a MOST EXPRESS RESIGNATION of\r\nhis POWER OF GARRISONING the same to Lt. Col. Dalrymple”: and to prove\r\nit they recite his Honor’s orders UNDER HIS OWN HAND, to Capt.\r\nPhillips, to deliver that Fort into the hands of the commanding\r\nofficer of his Majesty’s regular forces then upon the island, TO BE\r\nGARRISON’D by such detachment as HE SHOULD ORDER! To this indeed his\r\nhonor says, “There is nothing in the orders which I gave to Capt.\r\nPhillips, which does not perfectly consist with my retaining the\r\ncommand of the Castle, and my right to exchange the present garrison\r\nfor the former or any other, as I shall think proper”: But I must\r\nconfess, it is mysterious to me, how his Honor can retain the Right\r\nto dismiss Col. Dalrymple and his detachment, WHEN HE PLEASES, or\r\nexchange the present garrison for any other AS HE SHALL THINK PROPER,\r\nafter having delivered the fort without any reservation, into the\r\nhands of Col. Dalrymple, in consequence of EXPRESS ORDERS from\r\nanother, to be garrison’d by such detachment AS HE SHALL ORDER. I am\r\nnot so certain that his Honor, who pays a sacred regard to\r\ninstructions, will easily be perswaded to exchange the present\r\ngarrison for the former, or any other, however necessary such\r\nexchange may be, without first having leave from the right Hon. the\r\nEarl of Hillsborough, as full and EXPRESS as the orders he receiv’d\r\nfrom his lordship to place the present garrison there--Others may\r\nreconcile an absolute delegation of power without any reserve, by the\r\nexpress orders of a superior, with a right retain’d in the person who\r\nis THUS ORDER’D to delegate, to exercise the same power when he\r\npleases; I have not that INTUITIVE knowledge which some men are said\r\nto be bless’d with, and therefore it will not be thought strange if I\r\ndo not see clearly through this mystery in POLITICS.--The house\r\nfurther observe, that “as his Honor has heretofore repeatedly declared\r\nthat he has no authority over the King’s troops in the province,2 it\r\nwas absurd to suppose he COULD have the command of a fort, thus\r\nunreservedly surrendered to, and in full possession of such troops”:\r\nWhich appears to be a just conclusion; for can any one believe that\r\nCol. Dalrymple will hold himself oblig’d to march the King’s troops\r\nunder his command out of that fort, in obedience to the orders of one\r\nwho has no authority over them? Think not, Mess. Printers, that I am\r\nnow finding fault: For if his Honor has “in this instance divested\r\nhimself of a power of governing which is vested in him by the Charter\r\nFOR THE SAFETY of the province”, as wiser heads than mine have\r\ndetermin’d, who WILL DARE to find fault? It was done by virtue of\r\ninstructions; and we are told that instructions from a minister of\r\nstate come MEDIATELY from the K-----, and his Honor knows that\r\ninstructions, whatever “coarse epithet” may have been bestow’d upon\r\nthem, are “founded in very wise reasons”, and ought not to be treated\r\nwith contempt--HOLT, SOMERS and others, who near eighty years ago\r\nlaid their heads together to form our Charter, were certainly wise\r\nand great men; and King William who gave it was as certainly a wise\r\nand good King: But does not the wisdom of my Lord of H-----h far\r\nexceed theirs? Pray, does not every measure which he has advis’d,\r\nfully evince this to the conviction of all but a few factious fellows\r\nhere and there. The FRIENDS OF GOVERNMENT are willing to submit WHAT\r\nJUDGEMENT THEY HAVE to such profound wisdom; and what if our OLD\r\nFASHION Charter should be pared down by INSTRUCTIONS, and a power or\r\ntwo of the G-----r, vested in him FOR THE SAFETY OF THE PEOPLE, should\r\neven be annihilated by them, we are only to BELIEVE there are very\r\nwise reasons for it, and we shall find that all is for the best.\r\n\r\nBut it is said that “Mr. Hall the late chaplain (whose deposition was\r\nalso taken) has not only not given the House the form of words in\r\nwhich his Honor committed the CUSTODY of the Castle “according to the\r\nCharter” to Col. Dalrymple, but has substituted words which carry a\r\nvery different meaning.” --It is strange that Mr. Hall, whom his\r\nHonor directed to attend him--I suppose as a witness--should so\r\ngrosly mistake the meaning of the words. But whatever he may lack in\r\ncomprehension, memory or VERACITY, he shall, IF HE LIKES IT, be\r\ntouch’d up with the reputation of a very MODEST KIND OF GENTLEMAN;\r\n“he has with GREAT MODESTY declared that he COULD NOT RECOLLECT THE\r\nWORDS”--Mr. Hall’s expression is, “PERHAPS I MAY not recollect the\r\nwords EXACTLY”;--and “could ONLY recollect the impression they made\r\nupon his mind”--Here again we find Mr. Hall’s expression to be, “This\r\nas far as I can recollect is the impression they made upon my mind.”\r\nHe spoke upon memory, and if he delivered the SUBSTANCE of what he\r\nheard, his not being certain that he recollected the words EXACTLY,\r\nis not material--What then is the substance as deliver’d by Mr. Hall\r\nUNDER OATH, who has the character both of an honest and a sensible\r\nman, altho’ it is said that he substituted words which convey a very\r\ndifferent meaning? It is this; “By virtue of authority deriv’d from\r\nhis Majesty to govern this province, and in consequence of EXPRESS\r\nORDERS from the Right Hon. the Earl of Hillsborough to deliver this\r\nfort into the hands of the commanding officer of the King’s troops\r\nnow upon the island to be garrison’d by such detachment or detachments\r\nas HE SHALL THINK PROPER I deliver these keys to you as commanding\r\nofficer”. If his Honor has a copy of the EXACT FORM OF WORDS, and will\r\nfavor the publick with it, we shall be able to judge where the\r\ndifference is, and whether “in our opinion” it is MATERIAL. Perhaps\r\nthe words “according to the Charter” which I observe are comma’d in\r\nhis Honor’s reply as emphatical, are omitted by Mr. Hall: But if THEY\r\nare a part of the FORM OF WORDS, the house seem to have fully taken\r\nthem up by affirming that his Honor has no authority either BY THE\r\nCHARTER or his commission to delegate the power of garrisoning the\r\nCastle to any other person: And “that the SHEW of the authority of\r\nthe Governor thus held up serv’d only to make the surrender the more\r\nsolemn and formal.” If then he had no such authority to do it either\r\nby Charter or Commission, how could he do it by virtue of the\r\nauthority deriv’d from his Majesty to govern the province? unless\r\nthat authority is deriv’d to him to govern, SOLELY by the “EXPRESS\r\nORDERS from the Rt. Hon. the Earl of Hillsborough”--If so, where\r\nindeed “is the freedom of the Governor of this province”: I desire to\r\nknow, how his Honor in delivering the keys of the Castle and the\r\npower of garrisoning it to Col. Dalrymple, can be suppos’d to have\r\nexercis’d HIS OWN judgment and election, when he declares he did it\r\nin consequence of EXPRESS ORDERS from another? And that other does not\r\nappear to be his Majesty, but the Rt. Hon. the Earl of Hillsborough\r\n--The whole matter that could exercise his judgment, as it appears to\r\nme, must have been whether he should deliver the fort to Col.\r\nDalrymple to be garrison’d by such detachment of the regular forces as\r\nhe should think proper, in obedience to the EXPRESS ORDERS of Lord\r\nHillsborough, or retain the Right of committing the custody and\r\ngovernment thereof to such person or persons as to him should seem\r\nmeet, by virtue of the authority deriv’d from his Majesty to govern\r\nthe province according to the EXPRESS TERMS of the Charter.\r\n\r\nI may venture to say, there has not been an instance of this kind\r\nsince the date of our Charter; and in the opinion of judicious and\r\nunprejudiced persons, it is a matter of very great moment. Our enemies\r\nmay now have the pleasure of seeing the principal fort & key of the\r\nprovince in the hands of persons who have not the least dependance\r\nupon it; the captial environ’d with ships of war; the General Assembly\r\nremoved from its ancient seat, into the country; and the College,\r\nwhich has been liberally supported by the people for the education of\r\nour youth, has been made a seat of government, under a pretence, as\r\nit is said, of a prerogative in the Crown, to take up any public\r\nbuildings;--All by virtue of instructions, which we are implicitly to\r\nbelieve are founded in wise reasons; while the people thro’out the\r\nprovince, whether they are sensible of it or not, are every day\r\ncontributing to a revenue rais’d by the act of a legislature in which\r\nthey are not and cannot be represented, and against their most\r\nearnest petitions and warmest remonstrances! Surely these are not the\r\nblessings of adm-----n for which we are this week to return to\r\nAlmighty God our unfeigned thanks.\r\n\r\nWhen the public observe that the House had ordered Mr. Hall’s\r\ndeposition to be published at large, and that his Honor was DULY\r\nNOTIFIED TO BE PRESENT at the caption, perhaps it may be thought that\r\nthe mention that is made of the “care INDUSTRIOUSLY taken by the\r\nHouse to omit the reserve” Mr. Hall had made, because it “did not\r\nsuit their purpose”, might have been spared. Its not suiting their\r\npurpose, might be a sufficient reason for their ommitting it: But\r\npossibly his Honor’s manner of introducing it, may be taken be some\r\n“to convey a very different meaning.”\r\n\r\nAs to “the formality of delivering the keys of the fort,” I suppose\r\nit to have been in much the same FORM OF WORDS, as is used, when a\r\ngovernor who is recalled, delivers them to another who is to succeed\r\nhim in the government of the province by his Majesty’s appointment.\r\n--Col. Dalrymple accepted them “in consequence of orders from General\r\nGage,” without recognizing any subordination to his Honor. Whether he\r\nwill ever deliver them to any person, but such as may claim more\r\nauthority over the King’s troops in the province than the Lieutenant\r\nGovernor has, I very much doubt.--You shall hear from me again.---\r\n\r\nIn the mean while, I am yours,\r\n\r\nA CHATTERER.\r\n\r\n1See above, p. 43.\r\n2The identical words used by that warm friend to this province, the\r\ncolonies, the nation and all men but himself, Sir F.

Preston and the Soldiers who were indicted for the\r\nmurder of Messrs. Gray, Maverick, Caldwell, Carr and Attucks, on the\r\nfatal fifth of March last, occasions much speculation in this Town:\r\nAnd whatever may be the sentiments of men of the coolest minds abroad,\r\nconcerning the issue of this trial, we are not to doubt, but the\r\nCourt,1 the Jury, the Witnesses, and the Council on both sides, have\r\nconscienciously acquitted themselves: To be sure, no one in his\r\nsenses will venture to affirm the contrary.\r\n\r\nI am free to declare my opinion, that a cause of so great importance,\r\nnot only to this town, but to all his Majesty’s subjects, especially\r\nto the inhabitants of cities and sea-port towns; who are expos’d to\r\nhave troops posted among them, whenever the present administration\r\nshall take it into their heads in his Majesty’s name to send them;\r\nsuch a cause, I say, ought to be fairly stated to the public; that we\r\nmay from thence learn how far we are bound to submit to every band of\r\nsoldiers we may meet in the streets, and in what instances we may\r\nventure to interpose and prevent their murdering those whom we may\r\nthink to be innocent persons without being liable to be censured for\r\nacting unlawfully, if we escape with our own heads, if we should fall\r\nvictims to their rage and cruelty.\r\n\r\nIt was a question put by the chief magistrate of this province to the\r\nofficer who commanded on that bloody evening. “Did you not know that\r\nyou should not have fired without the order of a civil magistrate”.\r\nAnd it was sworn in court in the case of Capt. Preston, that he\r\nanswered, “I did it to save my Sentry”: But whatever his answer was,\r\nor however “unsatisfactory” to his Honor, the question plainly implies\r\nthat it was the judgment of his Honor, that the soldiers could not\r\njustify themselves in firing upon the people without the order of the\r\ncivil magistrate. Yet they did fire without such orders, and killed\r\nfive of his Majesty’s good subjects; most, if not all of whom were at\r\nthat time, for aught that has yet appear’d, in the peace of God and\r\nthe King! They not only fired without the orders of the civil\r\nmagistrate, but they never called for one, which they might easily\r\nhave done--They went down of their own accord, arm’d with musquets,\r\nand bayonets fix’d, presuming that they were cloath’d with as much\r\nauthority by the law of the land, as the Posse Comitatus of the\r\ncountry with the high sheriff at their head--How little regard is due\r\nto the word fo a m--r, who would fain have flatter’d us into a belief\r\nthat the troops were sent here to aid the civil magistrate, and were\r\nnever to act without one? And let me observe, how fatal are the\r\neffects, the danger of which I long ago mention’d, of posting a\r\nstanding army among a free people!\r\n\r\nIf his Honor was not mistaken in his judgment, and I presume he was\r\nnot, viz. that it was unlawful for them to fire without the order of\r\nthe civil magistrate, they were certainly from the beginning, at\r\nleast very imprudent and fool-hardy, in going down, arm’d as they\r\nwere, with weapons of death, without the direction of the civil\r\nmagistrate; especially, if they intended to fire, as I think it is\r\nmanifest they did.-- When Captain Preston was asked, Whether the\r\nsoldiers intended to fire, he answer’d they could not fire without\r\nhis orders: No one will pretend that they had not strength or skill\r\nto pull their trickers; but by the rules of the army, their own rules,\r\nthey were restrained from firing till he first gave them orders: Yet\r\ncontrary to those very rules they all did fire; all but one, and he\r\ndid all he could to fire, for his gun flush’d in the pan--it is said\r\nthat when it was urg’d by the council for the crown, that by the\r\nrules of law they ought to have retreated if they were in danger of\r\ntheir lives; it was answered, that by the rules of the army they\r\nwere chain’d as it were to their post--that they dared not to retreat\r\nwithout the orders of their captain--that in so doing they would have\r\n‘expos’d themselves to a sentence of death in a court martial:’--Yet\r\nwe have it from great authority that they would have been distracted\r\nif they had not fired, upon a supposition that they were in danger;\r\naltho’ by the same rules of war they could not have fired any more\r\nthan they could have retreated, till the captain order’d them; and\r\nthey expos’d themselves to be shot by the sentence of a court martial\r\nif they did fire, as much as they would have done if they had\r\nretreated without his order--Certainly it will not be said, it was\r\nmore becoming the bravery of a British soldier, to stand his ground\r\nagainst the subjects of his own King, and kill them upon the spot,\r\nthan to have retreated and deserted the glorious cause, and thus have\r\nsaved the lives of his Majesty’s subsjects.\r\n\r\nThe behavior of the party as they went from the main guard discover’d\r\nan haughty air--they push’d their bayonets and damn’d the people as\r\nthey went along--and when they arriv’d at their post, one witness who\r\nis a young gentleman of a liberal education and an unspotted\r\ncharacter, declared, that when they came down there were about ten\r\npersons round the sentry--that one of the prisoners whom he\r\nparticularly named, loaded his gun, pushed him with his bayonet and\r\ndamn’d him--that about fifty or sixty persons came down with the\r\nparty, and that he did not observe the people press on. Another\r\ndeclared, that when the soldiers were loading, about a dozen\r\nsurrounded them, and that several of them struck their guns--that he\r\nsaw ice or snow balls thrown, but did not apprehend himself or the\r\nsoldiers in danger by any thing he saw--This witness was very near\r\nthe soldiers; and will any one wonder, that when the soldiers were\r\nto all appearance meditating the death of people by loading their\r\nguns, while there was no apparent danger to them, some of the people\r\nshould strike their guns, to prevent the mischief which they seem’d\r\nto be resolv’d upon.\r\n\r\nAnother declared, that one of the prisoners whom he also named, struck\r\nhim upon the arm with his bayonet as the party came down before they\r\nformed; and that he had then told Capt. Preston that every body was\r\nabout dispersing--The characters of these witnesses will not be\r\ncontested. Such a conduct surely did not discover the most peaceable\r\ndisposition in this lawful assembly of soldiers--One would think that\r\nthey intended to assassinate those, who they had no reason to think\r\nhad the least inclination to injure them--If these are not instances\r\nof assault, I know not what an assault is: And if they were not an\r\nunlawful assembly before, it may well be suppos’d they were at this\r\ntime doing an unlawful act--an act that to be sure very ill became\r\ngentlemen soldiers sent here to curb a rebellious spirit and keep the\r\npeace: But there is a colouring at hand; and because this party did\r\nnot knock a witness down, or run him thro’, who had the audacity to\r\nrefuse at their sovereign order to move out of the way for them as\r\nthey pass’d the street from the main guard to the custom-house, tho’\r\nhe had then been push’d with a bayonet by one of them, it is\r\nsufficient to convince all the world of their lamb-like meekness and\r\nimmaculate innocence.\r\n\r\nI have in a former paper consider’d soldiers when quarter’d in free\r\ncities, in the light of other inhabitants, under the same direction\r\nof the civil magistrate and the same controul of the law of the land:\r\nand that by this law, like all other men, they are to be protected,\r\ngovern’d, restrain’d, rewarded or punish’d. If then a soldier has the\r\nright in common with other men, to arm himself for his defence when\r\nhe thinks there is a necessity for it, he has certainly no more right\r\nthen they, to use his weapons of death at random; or at all under a\r\npretence of suppressing riots, or any other pretence, without the\r\npresence of the civil magistrate, unless his own life is in danger,\r\nand he cannot retreat: Such a liberty would tend to increase the\r\ndisorder rather than suppress it, and would endanger life rather than\r\nsave it: In the instances I have mention’d, the lives of the soldiers\r\nwere not in danger from the men whom they assaulted: This was early\r\nin the tragical scene, and it was an assault personally upon those\r\nwho had not attempted to do them the least injury: How far their lives\r\nwere in danger afterwards, and who were in fault, shall be the subject\r\nof free Enquiry in a future paper.\r\n\r\nVINDEX.\r\n\r\n1The published report, cited above, p. 60, contains the charge to the\r\njury as given only by Judge Trowbridge and Judge Oliver. All that is\r\nextant of Judge Lynde’s charge to the jury is printed in The Diaries\r\nof Benjamin Lynde and of Benjamin Lynde, Jr., pp. 228-230.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE SIGNED “VINDEX”\r\n\r\nTo the Printers.\r\n\r\nThat the trial of the soldiers concern’d in the carnage on the\r\nmemorable 5th of March, was the most solemn trial that ever was had\r\nin this country, was pronounc’d from the bench. To see eight\r\nprisoners bro’t to the bar together, charg’d with the murder of five\r\npersons at one time, was certainly, as was then observ’d, affecting:\r\nBut whoever recollects the tragedy of that fatal evening, will I\r\nbelieve readily own that the scene then was much more affecting--There\r\nis something pleasing and solemn when one enters into a court of law\r\n--Pleasing, as there we expect to see the scale held with an equal\r\nhand--to find matters deliberately and calmly weigh’d and decided,\r\nand justice administered without any respect to persons or parties,\r\nand from no other motive but a sacred regard to truth--And it is\r\nsolemn as it brings to our minds the tribunal of GOD himself! before\r\nwhose judgment-seat the scriptures assure us all must appear: And I\r\nhave often tho’t that no one will receive a greater share of rewards\r\nat that decisive day, than he who has approv’d himself a faithful\r\nupright judge.\r\n\r\nWitnesses who are bro’t into a court of justice, while their veracity\r\nis not impeach’d, stand equal in the eye of the judge; unless he\r\nhappens to be acquainted with their different characters, which is\r\nnot presum’d--The jury who are taken from the vicinity, are suppos’d\r\nto know the credibility of the witnesses: In the late trials the\r\nwitnesses were most if not all of them either inhabitants of this town\r\nor transient persons residing in it, and the jurors were all from the\r\ncountry: Therefore it is not likely that they were acquainted with the\r\ncharacters of all the witnesses; and it is more than probable that in\r\nso great a number of witnesses there were different characters, that\r\nis, that some of them were more, others less creditable. If then the\r\njudge, whose province it is to attend to the law, and who, not knowing\r\nthe characters of the witnesses, presumes that they are all good, &\r\ngives an equal credit to them, it is the duty of the jurors who are\r\nsovereign in regard to facts, to determine in their own minds the\r\ncredibility of those who are sworn to relate the facts: And this in a\r\ntrial for murder requires great care and attention. I would just\r\nobserve here, that in the last trial there were not less than eighty-\r\ntwo witnesses for the jury to examine and compare, which was an\r\narduous task indeed! And I will venture further to observe, that some\r\nof these witnesses who swore very positively were not so creditable\r\nas others, and the testimony of one of them in particular, which was\r\nvery precisely related & very peremptory, might have been invalidated\r\nin every part of it. I shall not at present suggest what I take to be\r\nthe reason why it was not done. These matters will no doubt have\r\ntheir place in the history of the present times in some future day,\r\nwhen the faithful recorder it is to be hoped will, to use the language\r\nof our courts of justice, relate the truth, the whole truth, and\r\nnothing but the truth.\r\n\r\nIt is enough for the jury to receive the law from the bench: They may\r\nindeed determine this for themselves; but of facts they are ever the\r\nuncontroulable judges. They ought therefore to receive the facts from\r\nthe mouths of the witnesses themselves, and implicitly from no other:\r\nUnless the jury particularly attend to this, they may be in danger of\r\nbeing misled by persons who would be far from doing it with design:\r\nFor instance, if one should swear that A being foreworn’d against it,\r\nlevell’d his gun and kill’d B: and afterwards it should be forgot,\r\nthat the witness also swore that A immediately advanc’d & push’d his\r\nbayonet at C, which pass’d between his waistcoat and his skin; if this\r\nI say should be forgot, and should be overlook’d by the jury when they\r\nare together, perhaps instead of bringing it in murder according to\r\nthe rules of the law laid down by the bench, they would bring it in\r\nmanslaughter--I do not here affirm that this has ever been a fact: I\r\nmention it as what may hereafter be a fact, and to show the necessity\r\nof a jury’s relying upon facts as they receive them from the witnesses\r\nthemselves, and from them alone.\r\n\r\nThe furor brevis which we have heard much of, the fury of the blood\r\nwhich the benignity of the law allows for upon sudden provocation, is\r\nsuppos’d to be of short duration--the shooting a man dead upon the\r\nspot, must have stopp’d the current in the breast of him who shot him,\r\nif he had not been bent upon killing--an attempt to stab a second\r\nperson immediately after, infers a total want of remorse at the\r\nshedding of human blood; and such a temper of mind afterwards\r\ndiscovers the rancorous malice before, especially if it be proved that\r\nthe same man had declated that he would never miss an opportunity so\r\nto do:  If this does not imply malice at first, I do not see but he\r\nmight have gone on stabbing people in his furor brevis, till he had\r\nkill’d an hundred; and after all, it might have been adjudg’d, in\r\nindulgence to the human passions, excuseable homicide.\r\n\r\nThe law in its benignity makes allowance for human passions: But the\r\nlaw is just; and make this allowance upon the principles of justice:\r\nIt gives no indulgence to malice and rancour against any individual;\r\nmuch less against a community or the human species--He who threatens\r\nor thirsts for the blood of the community is an enemy to the publick;\r\nand hostis humani generis, the enemy of mankind consummates the\r\nvillain. I will not take upon myself to say that either of these\r\ncharacters belong to any of the late prisoners--There are two\r\nremaining yet in gaol, convicted of manslaughter, and waiting\r\njudgment of the court. With regard to one of these, namely, Kilroi,\r\nit was sworn that about a week or a fortnight before (the 5th of\r\nMarch, which must be before the affray at the ropewalks, that\r\nhappening on the 2d) he said he would never miss an opportunity of\r\nfiring upon the inhabitants, and that he had wanted such--It is said\r\nthat these might be words spoken in jest, or without any intention,\r\nwhen they were spoken, of acting according to their true import &\r\nmeaning: But the witness said, he repeated the words several times:\r\nAnd that after he had told him he was a very great fool for saying so,\r\nhe again declared he would never miss an opportunity.--It appears that\r\nthe witness himself, as any one might, tho’t him to be in earnest,\r\nand rebuked him for saying so; and in truth, none but a madman, or one\r\nwhose heart was desperately wicked, would repeatedly, especially after\r\nsuch wholesome reproof, have persisted in such a threat; It\r\ndiscovered, to borrow the expression of a very polite & humane\r\ngentleman, upon another late occasion, a malignity beyond what might\r\nhave been expected from a Barbarian.\r\n\r\nIt was also sworn, that this same Kilroi was with a party of soldiers\r\nin the affray at the Ropewalks a few evenings before the 5th of March,\r\n--and that they had clubs & cutlasses--That Kilroi was of the party of\r\nsoldiers that fired in King-street--that as the party came round\r\nbefore they form’d, Kilroi struck a witness upon his arm--and after\r\nthe firing began, Kilroi struck at the same witness, tho’ he had\r\nhear’d nothing said, nor seen any thing done to provoke the soldiers.\r\n--Another witness declared, that he saw Kilroi there, that he knew\r\nhim well before, and was positive it was he--that he heard the word\r\nfire, twice, upon which he said to the soldiers, damn you, don’t fire,\r\nand Kilroi fired at once, and killed Gray, who had no weapon, and his\r\narms were folded in his bosom. Gray fell at the feet of this witness,\r\nand immediately Kilroi pushed his bayonet at the witness, which pass’d\r\nthro’ all his clothes, and came out at his surtuit behind, and he was\r\noblig’d to turn round to quit himself of the weapon--the witness\r\nsuppos’d he designed to kill them both.--How long is this furor\r\nbrevis, this short hurricane of passion to last in the breast of a\r\nsoldier, when called, not by the civil magistrate, but by his military\r\nofficer, under a pretence of protecting a Centinel, and suppressing a\r\nRiot? who had taken with him weapons, not properly of defence, but of\r\ndeath, and was calm enough in this impetuosity of anger, to load his\r\ngun, and perhaps with design, to level it, for it killed one of the\r\nvery men with whom he had had a quarrel but a few evenings before: He\r\nhad now a fair opportunity, which he had wished for, and resolved\r\nnever to miss, of firing upon the inhabitants. It was said upon the\r\nwords he uttered, that if all the unjustifiable words that had been\r\nspoken by the inhabitants of this town, were to be bro’t in judgment\r\nagainst them, they would have much to answer for.--Those who believe\r\nthe letters of governor Bernard, the Commissioners of the customs,\r\nand some others whom I could name, and will name in proper time, may\r\nthink so. I dare say, if Bernard could have proved one overt-act of\r\nrebellion or treason, after the many things he pretended had been\r\nsaid, and he or his tools could have had any influence, the words if\r\nprov’d, would have been adjudg’d to have been said in sober earnest,\r\nand would have been considered as material to have shown the\r\nmalignancy of the heart.\r\n\r\nThis Kilroi’s bayonet was prov’d to be the next morning bloody five\r\ninches from the point. It was said to be possible that this might be\r\noccassion’d by the bayonet’s falling into the human blood, which ran\r\nplentifully in the street, for one of their bayonets was seen to fall.\r\nIt is possible, I own; but much more likely that this very bayonet was\r\nstab’d into the head of poor Gray after he was shot, and that this\r\nmay account for its being bloody five inches from the point--Such an\r\ninstance of Savage barbarity there undoubtedly was.--It was sworn\r\nbefore the Magistrate who first examined into this cruel tragedy,\r\nthough the witness who then swore it, being out of this province,\r\ncould not be produced in Court upon the trial. It is not to be\r\nwonder’d at that any material witness was out of the way, when it is\r\nconsider’d that the trial did not come on till the secord term, and\r\nnine months after the facts were committed. I shall continue the\r\nsubject at my leisure.\r\n\r\nVINDEX.\r\n\r\nDec. 11th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE SIGNED “VINDEX.”\r\n\r\n[Boston Gazette, December 24, 1770.]\r\n\r\nTo the Printers.\r\n\r\nIn the late trials of Preston and the Soldiers, it was observ’d that\r\nthe Court constantly from day to day adjourn’d at noon and at sun-set\r\n--Our enemies, who are fruitful in their inventions, may possibly from\r\nhence take occasion to represent that it was dangerous for the Court\r\nto sit in the tumultuous town of Boston after dark. At the first view\r\nit may perhaps bear this complexion in the eye of a prejudiced\r\nstranger; for such adjournments in capital causes it may be were never\r\nbefore known here: But the representation would be without the least\r\nfoundation in truth. It is possible that among other reasons this\r\nmight be one, that the judges are all of them, to use the words of a\r\ngood old Patriarch, well stricken in years, and one of them labours\r\nunder infirmities of Body. I have another observation to make on this\r\noccasion, but I reserve it till a future opportunity.\r\n\r\nI have already said that the Soldiers in coming down from the main-\r\nguard to the custom-house behaved with an haughty air--that they\r\nabused the people as they pass’d along--pushing them with their\r\nbayonets--and damning them; and when they had got to their post, they\r\nin like manner abused and struck innocent persons there who offer’d\r\nthem no injury--and all this was even before they form’d, in doing\r\nwhich it does not appear to be danger to them or any one else. These\r\nfacts, I think were prov’d, if we may believe persons of good credit,\r\nwho declared them upon their oaths in Court:--And that they came down\r\nunder a pretence of suppressing a riot, without a civil magistrate or\r\npeace officer, which ought always to be remembered, no one will\r\ndispute.\r\n\r\nThere was indeed a sort of evidence bro’t into Court, which, if it is\r\nat all to be rely’d upon, may serve to invalidate in some measure what\r\nhas been said--namely the declaration of one of the deceas’d persons,\r\nas it was related by a gentleman who dress’d his wounds, and to whom\r\nhe is said to have declared it. This man, as the doctor testified,\r\ntold him among many other things, that he saw some Soldiers passing\r\nfrom the main-guard to the custom-house and the people pelted them as\r\nthey went along. But whether these Soldiers were Preston and his\r\nparty; or other Soldiers who are mention’d by another witness, as\r\ngoing from the main-guards towards the Centry, having short coats and\r\narm’d with bayonets, swords or sticks, and one of them with a pair of\r\nkitchen tongs, chasing the people as they went, must remain an\r\nuncertainty--If he meant the former, it is somewhat strange that among\r\nall the witnesses on both sides, no one saw the people pelting them as\r\nthey went along but he. This man confess’d to the doctor that he was\r\na fool to be there--was surprized at the forbearance of the soldiers;\r\nbelieved that they fired in their own defence & freely forgave the man\r\nthat shot him. But it is to be observed, he did not declare this under\r\noath nor before a magistrate: It was however the dying speech,--very\r\naffecting and all, true no doubt; altho’ no one knew the character of\r\nthis believing penitent either in point of veracity or judgment.--By\r\nthe testimony of his land-lady in Court, one would not form the best\r\nopinion of him; but de mortuis nil nisi bonum.\r\n\r\nThere were others ready to be sworn, if the Council for the crown had\r\nthought it worth while to have bro’t them forward, that they also\r\ncould relate what this man had told them, viz. that his doctors had\r\nencouraged him that he would soon recover of his wounds, and he hoped\r\nto live to be a swift witness against the soldiers--Great stress was\r\nlaid by some upon the simple declaration of this man, who in all\r\nprobability died in the faith of a roman catholick. This, however, I\r\nam apt to think, will not disparage his declaration in the opinion\r\nof some great men at home, even tho’ he did not make his confession to\r\na ghostly physician.\r\n\r\nBefore I proceed to enquire into the danger the Soldiers were in, if\r\nthey were in any at all, and who were in fault, I will take the\r\nliberty to lead the reader back to a consideration of the temper the\r\nSoldiers in general discovered, and their correspondent conduct, for\r\nsome considerable time before the fatal tragedy was acted--It is well\r\nknown indeed that from their first landing, their behavior was to a\r\ngreat degree insolent; and such as look’d as if they had enter’d\r\ndeeply into the spirit of those who procur’d them,--and really\r\nbelieved, that we were a country of rebels and they were sent here to\r\nsubdue us. But for some time before the fifth of March, they more\r\nfrequently insulted the inhabitants who were quietly passing the\r\nstreets; and gave out many threats, that on that very night the blood\r\nwould run down the streets of Boston, and that many who would dine on\r\nMonday would not breakfast on Tuesday; and to show that they were in\r\nearnest they forewarn’d their particular acquaintance to take care of\r\nthemselves--These things were attested before the magistrates by\r\ncredible persons under oath.--Accordingly when the Monday evening came\r\non, they were early in every part of the town arm’d with bludgeons,\r\nbayonets and cutlasses, beating those whom they could, and assaulting\r\nand threatning others--By the way, I will just observe for the\r\ninformation of a certain honorable gentleman, that the name of\r\nbludgeons was unheard of in this town till the Soldiers arrived--This\r\nbehavior put the inhabitants in mind of their threatenings; and was\r\nthe reason that those of them who had occasion to walk the streets,\r\ncame out arm’d with canes or clubs. Between eight and nine o’clock,\r\nthe Soldiers in Murray’s barracks in the centre of the town rush’d out\r\nwith their naked cutlasses insulting, beating and wounding the\r\ninhabitants who were passing along: This, in so frequented a street,\r\nnaturally collected numbers of people who resented the injury done\r\nand an affray ensued--About the same time a difference arose in King-\r\nstreet, between a centry there and a barber’s boy, who said to his\r\nfellow-apprentice in the hearing of the centry “there goes Capt.-----\r\nwho has not paid my master for dressing his hair:” The centry\r\nfoolishly resented it, and word took place; and the boy answering him\r\nwith pertness, & calling him a name, the centry struck him. Here was\r\nthe first assault in King-street.--But for what reason the evidence\r\nof this matter was not bro’t into Court, at the last trial, as it had\r\nbeen at the trial of Preston, the reader if he pleases may conjecture.\r\nAt the same time a gentleman not living far from the custom-house,\r\nand hearing as he tho’t a distant cry of murder, came into the street,\r\nwhich he had just before left perfectly still, and to use his words,\r\n“never clearer”: He there saw a party of Soldiers issue from the\r\nmainguard, and heard them say, damn them where are they, by Jesus let\r\nthem come; and presently after another party rush’d thro’ Quaker-lane\r\ninto the street, using much such expressions:--Their arms glitter’d in\r\nthe moon-light. These cried fire, and ran up the street and into\r\nCornhill which leads to Murray’s barracks; in their way they knocked\r\ndown a boy of twelve years old, a son of Mr. Appleton, abused and\r\ninsulted several gentlemen at their doors and others in the street:--\r\nTheir cry was, damn them, where are they, knock them down; and it is\r\nsuppos’d they join’d in the affray there, which still continued--They\r\nalso then cried fire, which one of the witnesses took to be their\r\nwatch-word.\r\n\r\nBy this time the barber’s boy had return’d to the centry with a\r\nnumber of other boys to resent the blow he had received: The centry\r\nloaded his gun and threatened to fire upon them, and they threatened\r\nto knock him down--The bells were ringing as for fire: Occasion’d\r\neither by the Soldiers crying fire as is before mention’d, for it is\r\nusual in this town when fire is cried, for any one who is near a\r\nchurch to set the bells a ringing; or it might be, to alarm the town,\r\nfrom an apprehension of some of the inhabitants, that the Soldiers\r\nwere putting their former threats into execution, and that there\r\nwould be a general massacre: It is not to be wonder’d at, that some\r\npersons were under such apprehensions; when even an officer at\r\nMurray’s barracks, appeared to encourage the Soldiers and headed them,\r\nas it was sworn before the magistrate.--This officer was indicted by\r\nthe grand jury, but he could not be found afterwards--Some other\r\nofficers, and particularly lieutenants Minchen and Dickson, discovered\r\na very different temper.\r\n\r\nThe ringing of the bells alarmed the town, it being suppos’d by the\r\npeople in general there was fire; and occasion’d a concourse in King-\r\nstreet which is a populous part of it. As the people came into the\r\nstreet, the barber’s boy told them that the centry had knock’d him\r\ndown--and a person who had come into the street thro’ Royal-exchange\r\nlane, which leads from Murray’s barracks, (and possibly had observ’d\r\nthe behavior of the Soldiers there) and seeing the centry, cried\r\nhere’s a Soldier--Various were the dispositions and inclinations of\r\nthe people according to their various “feelings” no doubt; for\r\nmankind, it is said, “act from their feelings more than their reason:”\r\nThe cooler sort advis’d to go home: The curious were willing to stay\r\nand see the event, and those whose feelings were warmer, perhaps\r\npartook of the boys resentment. So it had been before at Murray’s\r\nbarracks, and so it always will be among a multitude: At the barracks\r\nsome, to use the expression of one of the witnesses, called out home,\r\nhome; while some in their heat cried, huzza for the main-guard--there\r\nis the nest--This was said by a person of distinction in court, to\r\nsavour of treason! Tho’ it was allow’d on both sides, that the main-\r\nguard was not molested thro’ the whole evening.\r\n\r\nI would here beg the reader’s further patience, while I am a little\r\nmore particular, in relation to the affray at Murray’s barracks; for\r\nit may be of importance to enquire how it began there.--Mr. Jeremiah\r\nBelknap, an householder of known good reputation, had been sworn\r\nbefore the magistrate; and why he was not bro’t in as a witness at the\r\ntrial, is not my business to say, and I shall not at present even\r\nconjecture--Mr. Belknap, who lived in Cornhill near Murray’s barracks,\r\ntestified, that on the first appearance of the affray there, hearing\r\na noise he ran to his door, and heard one say he had been struck by\r\na Soldier: he presently saw eight or nine Soldiers arm’d with clubs\r\nand cutlasses, come out of Boylston’s alley, which is a very short\r\npassage leading from Murray’s barracks into the street--he desired\r\nthem to retire to the barracks--one of them with a club in one hand\r\nand a cutlass in the other, with the latter, made a stroke at him:\r\nFinding no prospect of stopping them, he ran to the main-guard and\r\ncalled for the officers of the guard--he was inform’d, there was no\r\nofficer there--he told the Soldiers, with drawn cutlasses, who he\r\nsuppos’d were of the party from Murray’s barracks--Another gentleman,\r\none of the prisoners witnesses, swore in Court, that a little after\r\neight o’clock he saw at his own door, which is very near the barracks,\r\nseveral Soldiers passing and repassing, some with clubs, others with\r\nbayonets: And then he related the noise & confusion he afterwards\r\nheard, & the squabble he saw, but no blows--that he saw two Soldiers,\r\neach at a different time, present his gun at the people, threatning\r\nto make a lane through them; but the officers drove them in--The\r\ntragedy was compleated very soon in King-street--The firing was\r\nreserv’d for another party of Soldiers, not much if at all to their\r\ndiscredit in the judgment of some, and under the command of an officer\r\nwho did not restrain them. The witness heard the report of the first\r\ngun soon after the people cried home, home; and declared that he tho’t\r\nthey had fired upon the main guard, for he heard the drum at the main\r\nguard beat to arms--Another, who was sworn in Court, a witness for the\r\nCrown declared, that about nine o’clock, passing near Draper’s (or\r\nBolyston’s) alley, which leads into Murray’s barracks, and thro’ which\r\nhe intended to go, he heard some boys huzzaing--he judged there were\r\nnot more than six or seven, and they were small; they ran thro’\r\ndock-square towards the Market--Presently after he saw two or three\r\npersons in the alley with weapons--a number of Soldiers soon sallied\r\nout, arm’d with large naked cutlasses, assaulting every body coming in\r\ntheir way--that he himself narrowly escaped a cut from the foremost\r\nof them who pursued him; and that he saw a man there, who said he was\r\nwounded by them and he felt of the wound--The wounded man stopped, and\r\nthis occasioned the people who were passing to gather round him--\r\nThinking it dangerous fo him to proceed, the witness returned home--\r\nA Captain of the 14th, one of the prisoners witnesses was also sworn\r\nin Court: He testified that in Cornhill he saw a mob collected at the\r\npass (Boylston’s alley) leading to Murray’s barracks--the people were\r\npelting the Soldiers he tho’t had a fire-shovel--as soon as they\r\nknew him, he prevailed on them to go to the bottom of the pass, and\r\nwith some difficulty he got down--This witness, it seems, must have\r\nbeen later than the others; and Mr. Belknap, perhaps gives as early\r\nan account of it, as any can, but the Soldiers themselves.\r\n\r\nI would only ask how it came to pass that the Soldiers, on that\r\nparticular evening, should be seen abroad, in every part of the town,\r\ncontrary to the rules of the army, after eight o’clock--If the\r\nofficers, who should have restrain’d them, were careless of their\r\nduty, whence was so general a carelessness among the officers at that\r\njuncture? It was said, there was no officer at the main-guard, which\r\nmay in part account for it. Or, if the Soldiers were all at once\r\nungovernable by their officers, and could not be restrain’d by them,\r\na child may judge from the appearance they made, that there had been\r\na general combination, agreable to their former threats, on that\r\nevening to put in execution some wicked and desperate design.\r\n\r\nVINDEX.\r\n\r\nDec. 18th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE SIGNED “VINDEX.”\r\n\r\n[Boston Gazette, December 24, 1770.]\r\n\r\nTo the Printers.\r\n\r\nSOMEBODY, in Mr. Draper’s paper of Thursday last, charges me with\r\nPARTIALITY, in my two first performances on the subject of the late\r\nTrial--I DENY THE CHARGE, AND DESIRE HE WOULD EXPLAIN HIMSELF. He\r\nalso says, I freely charge PARTIALITY on others: I UTTERLY DENY THAT\r\nALSO; AND CALL UPON HIM TO POINT OUT ONE INSTANCE. He desires the\r\npublick would not be influenced by any remarks made by me on the late\r\nTrials: WITH REGARD TO THAT, THE PUBLICK WILL DO AS THEY PLEASE. He\r\nINSINUATES that I have cast the most INJURIOUS reflections upon\r\nJudges, Jury and Witnesses: AGAIN, I DENY IT.--It remains then that\r\nhe either retract his charges or proves them: Otherwise the publick\r\nwill judge him to be guilty of something worse than “THE FAULT” OF\r\nPARTIALITY. He THREATENS to bring out some facts which were not\r\nallowed to be given in evidence: THIS IS WHAT I EARNESTLY DESIRE, FOR\r\nTHE REASONS I HAVE ALREADY MENTION’D. And among other FACTS he\r\nintends, to ASCERTAIN THE PERSON IN A RED CLOAK, mention’d on the\r\ntrial, IF VINDEX AND HIS Adherents DESIRE it. Vindex has no\r\nAdherents but in the cause of truth: And Vindex, FOR THE SAKE OF\r\nTRUTH, REQUESTS IT AS A FAVOR THAT THE PERSON IN A RED CLOAK MAY BE\r\nASCERTAINED. He says that this person WAS DECLARED BE SOME OF THE\r\nWITNESSES, TO HAVE BEEN VERY BUSY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TRAGEDY; I\r\naffirm, that neither of the witnesses declared that he was VERY BUSY\r\nat the beginning, or any part, of the Tragedy. There were two only\r\nthat made mention of him, viz. Mr. WILLIAM HUNTER & Mr. JAMES SELKRIG:\r\nThe one declared that in dock-square “there was a tall gentleman in\r\na red Cloak; that he stood in the midst of them (the people); that\r\nthey were whist for some time, and presently huzza’d for the main\r\nguard: The other said, there was a gentleman with a red Cloak & a\r\nlarge white Wig; that he made a speech to them (the people) 4 or 5\r\nminute--(this witness mention’d nothing of their HUZZAING for the main\r\nguard, which one would have thought must have been OBSERVABLE by ALL,\r\nbut only adds) they went and knock’d with their sticks, and said they\r\nwould do for the soldiers--What THE TALL GENTLEMAN said, neither of\r\nthem could tell.--I cannot help observing here, that some of the late\r\nLETTER-WRITERS from hence to London, have mark’d the RED CLOAK AND\r\nWHITE WIG, as the garb of a Boston HYPOCRITE; but I have never yet\r\nheard it hinted, that such a dress was the peculiarity of an ACTOR in\r\nTRAGEDIES--Great pain have been taken to make the world believe that\r\nmen of “estates, of figure and religion” had formed a plan, BEFORE THE\r\n5TH OF MARCH, to drive off the soldiers; witness a DEPOSITION LATELY\r\nPUBLISH’D: And perhaps it may be the LOW CUNNING of this writer to\r\nINSINUATE, that there was a mob at that time, AND FOR THAT PURPOSE,\r\non dock-square; and that their leader MUST be a man of figure in the\r\ntown, BECAUSE HE WORE A RED CLOAK--As it is not yet known what the\r\nTALL GENTLEMAN WITH A RED CLOAK said to the people; whether he gave\r\nthem good or ill advice, or any advice at all, we may possibly form\r\nsome conjecture concerning it, when his PERSON is ascertained. THE\r\nSOONER IT IS DONE THE BETTER.\r\n\r\nVINDEX.\r\n\r\nDec. 22.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN WILKES.\r\n\r\n[MS., British Museum; a draft is in the Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox\r\nLibrary; a text is in W. V. Wells, Life of Samuel Adams, vol. i.,\r\npp. 377, 378.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON Decr 28 1770\r\n\r\nSIR\r\n\r\nHaving been repeatedly sollicited by my friend, Mr William Palfrey,1\r\nI embrace this opportunity of making my particular compliments to you,\r\nin a Letter which he will deliver. My own Inclination had coincided\r\nwith his Request; for I should pride myself much, in a Correspondence\r\nwith a Gentleman, of whom I have long entertaind so great an Opinion.\r\n--No Character appears with a stronger Luster in my Mind, than that\r\nof a Man, who nobly perseveres in the Cause of publick Liberty,\r\nand Virtue, through the Rage of Persecution: Of this, you have\r\nhad a large Portion; but I dare say, you are made the better by\r\nit: At least I will venture to say, that the sharpest Persecution\r\nfor the sake of ones Country, can never prove a real Injury to an\r\nhonest Man.\r\n\r\nIn this little Part of the World - a Land, till of late happy in\r\nits Obscurity - the Asylum, to which Patriots were formerly wont\r\nto make their peaceful Retreat; even here the stern Tyrant has\r\nlifted up his iron Rod, and makes his incessant Claim as Lord of\r\nthe Soil: But I have a firm Perswasion in my Mind, that in every\r\nStruggle, this Country will approve her self, as glorious in\r\ndefending & maintaining her Freedom, as she has heretofore been\r\nhappy in enjoying it.\r\n\r\nWere I a Native and an Inhabitant of Britain, & capable of\r\naffording the least Advice, it should constantly be; to confirm\r\nthe Colonies in the fullest Exercise of their Rights, and even to\r\nexplore for them every possible Avenue of Trade, which should not\r\ninterfere with her own Manufactures. From the Colonies, when she\r\nis worn with Age, she is to expect renewed Strength. But the Field\r\nI am entering, is too large for the present: May Heaven forbid,\r\nthat it should yet be truly said of Great Britain, Quam Deus yult\r\nperdere, -!\r\n\r\nI am with strict Truth\r\nSir\r\nYour most humbe Servt\r\n\r\n\r\n1See above, page 9.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE [SIGNED \"VINDEX.\"]1\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nTo THE PRINTER\r\n\r\nIn my last I considerd the Temper which the Soldiers in general\r\nhad discoverd and the threats they had [utter'd] previous to the\r\nfifth of March together with their correspondent Behavior on that\r\nalarming Evening. I was the more brief, because there had been a\r\nnarrative of the horrid massacre, printed by the order of this\r\nTown, which was drawn up by a Comt appointed for that purpose; and\r\nreported by their Chairman, JAMES BOWDOIN Esqr. The affidavits\r\nwhich are annexd to the narrative were each of them taken before\r\ntwo Justices of the Peace Quorum Unus to perpetuate the remembrance of\r\nthe thing: Coll William Dalrymple, chiefe Commander of the Soldiers,\r\nwas duly notified by the Justices to attend the Captions: And His\r\nHonor the Lt Governor certified, under his Hand with the province Seal\r\nannexd, that full faith & Credit was & ought to be given to the\r\nseveral Acts & Attestations of the Justices, both in Court & without.\r\n\r\nThe Candor of the Town indeed was such, that at their meeting in\r\nMarch, 2 by a Vote they restraind their Committee from publishing\r\nthe narrative, lest it might unduly prejudice those whose lot it\r\nshould be to be jurors to try these Causes: This restraint they\r\ncontinued by a Vote at their meeting in May,3 & untill the\r\nTrials should be over . . . plaud; as it discovered a Sense of\r\nJustice; as well as the greatest Humanity4 towards those men who\r\nhad wantonly lit the hearts Blood of citizens like Water upon\r\nGround. A Temper far from vindictive; calm and moderate, at a\r\ntime, when if ever they might have been expected to be off their\r\nGuard: And yet, so barbarous & cruel, so infamously mean & base\r\nwere the Enemies of this Town, who are the common Enemies of all\r\nAmerica & of the Truth it self, that they falsly inserted in the\r\npublick news papers in London the Inhabitants had seizd upon Capt\r\nPreston hung & hung him like Porteus upon a Sign Post! -\r\n\r\nI shall now in a few ......... endeavor to show the Temper which\r\nsome of the Soldiers, (by whom I do not now particularly mean the\r\nlate Prisoners), discoverd at & after the fatal Catastrophes.\r\nReaders may have observd, that I am careful to distinguish between\r\nthe evidence given in Court from that which was given out of\r\nCourt, Witnesses to this point, it ought not to be supposd, were\r\nadmissible at the Trial, unless perhaps the one immediately\r\nfollowing: That a credible Person, who is mistress of a reputable\r\nfamily in the Town. She testified before the Magistrates, & was\r\nready to swear it in Court, if she had been called, that on the\r\nEvening of the 5 of March a number of Soldiers were assembled from\r\nGreens Barracks & opposite to her Gate, which is near those\r\nBarracks - that they stood very still until the Guns were fired in\r\nKingstreet; then they clapd their Hands & gave a Cheer, saying,\r\nthis is all we want; they then ran to their Barrack &\r\ncame out again in a few minutes, all with their arms, & ran\r\ntowards Kingstreet.5 These Barracks were about a quarter of a mile\r\nfrom Kingstreet: Their standing very still, untill they heard the\r\nfiring, compared with their subsequent Conduct, looks as if they\r\nexpected it; it seems, as though they knew what the Signal should\r\n[be], & the part they were to act in Consequence of it. This\r\nperhaps may be thought by some to be too straining: I will not\r\nurge it, but leave it to any one to judge, how far if at all, it\r\naffords Grounds of Suspicion, that there was an understanding\r\nbetween the Soldiers in Kingstreet at the time of the firing &\r\nthese; especially, if it be true as has been said, that they fired\r\nwithout the Command of their officers - There was another Witness\r\nsimilar to this; an housholder of good reputation, who testified,\r\nthat the Soldiers from Greens Barracks rushd by him with their\r\nArms towards Kingstreet, saying this is our time or chance; that\r\nhe never saw6 Dogs so greedy for their prey as they seemd to be,\r\nand the Sergeants could hardly keep them in their ranks.7\r\n\r\nAnother swore, that after the firing, he saw the Soldiers drawn up\r\nin the Street, and heard Officers [as] they walked backwards &\r\nforwards say, Damn it, what a fine fire that was! How bravely it\r\ndispersd the mob!8 A person belonging to Hallifax in Nova Scotia,\r\ntestified that when the Body of troops was drawn up before the\r\nGuard house (which was presently after the Massacre) he heard an\r\nofficer say to another, that this was fine work, just what he\r\nwanted.9 I shall add but one more to this List, and that is the\r\nTestimony of a Witness, well known for an honest man in this Town,\r\nwho declared, that at about one o'Clock the next morning, as he\r\nwas going alone from his own house to the Town House, he met a\r\nSergeant of the 29th with Eight [or] nine Soldiers, all with very\r\nlarge Clubs & Cutlasses when one of them speaking of the\r\nSlaughter, swore by God it was a fine thing & said you shall see\r\nmore of it.10 These Testimonies it is confessd would not be\r\npertinent to the Issue of the late Tryal: But I think it necessary\r\nto adduce them here to convince the World of the wretched\r\nCondition this town was in, the Reasons they had to apprehend &\r\nthe necessity they were under constantly to be upon their Guard\r\nwhile such were quarterd among them: Much was brot into Court to\r\nshow that the Town was in a State of disorder on the Evening of\r\nthe 5 of March previous to the Affray at Murrays Barracks;\r\nWitnesses were admitted to testify that they were met by one &\r\nanother armd with Clubs.11 But Nothing appeard there to show the\r\nCause & even the Necessity of it.11\r\n\r\nTo these, I cannot help subjoining the Testimony of Mr John Cox, a\r\nvery reputable Inhabitant of this town; who swore in Court at one\r\nof the late trials, that after the firing, he went to take up the\r\ndead - that he told the Soldiers, it was a cowardly trick in them\r\nto kill men within reach of their Bayonets, with nothing in their\r\nhands, and that the officer said, damn them, fire again & let them\r\ntake the Consequence! - to which he replyd you have killed . . .\r\nalready to hang you all - But he was mistaken.\r\n\r\nIt is a Mistake to say the soldiers were in danger from the\r\nInhabitants. The reverse is true; the Inhabitants were in danger\r\nfrom the Soldiers. With all the Indulgence which was & perhaps\r\nought to be shown to Prisoners upon Tryal for Life, not a single\r\nInstance of any Injury offerd to Soldiers was provd, except at\r\nMurrays Barracks, & not even there but in return for intollerable\r\nInsults. Many Witness[es] were ready if called for to testify to\r\nthe Insults & Abuse offerd by the Soldiers to the Inhabitants in\r\nvarious parts of the Town.\r\n\r\nThus one of the prisoners Witnesses testified in Court that at 7\r\no'Clock going to the South End he met forty or fifty in small\r\nParties, four or five in a party. It has been testified by a\r\ncredible Witness that before the fifth of March, the Soldiers were\r\nnot only seen making their Clubs, but from what the Witness could\r\ncollect from their Conversation, they were resolvd to be revengd\r\non Monday13 and divers others swore to the same purpose; They did\r\nnot indeed say, whether they knew them to be soldiers or\r\nInhabitants: It is as probable that they were Soldiers as\r\nInhabitants; for it was sworn before the magistrates by a person\r\nof Credit, that on the Saturday before he saw the Soldiers\r\nmaking Clubs; Another was ready to testify in Court that thirty of\r\nthese Clubs or Bludgeons were made, by the Soldiers, in his own\r\nShop. And in the part of the Town where the Witness was going, a\r\nGentleman was attackd by two Soldiers, one of them armd with a\r\nClub & the other with a broad Sword; the latter struck him, &\r\nthreatned that he should soon hear more of it. It was notorious\r\nthat the Soldiers were seen frequently on that evening armd with\r\nClubs - but in the Judgment of some men, every party that was seen\r\nwith Clubs, or in the modern term, Bludgeons, to be sure must have\r\nbeen Inhabitants. If the Soldiers were in such Danger why were\r\nthey not kept in their Barracks after Eight o'clock agreable to\r\ntheir own orders? In stead of this we find the Testimony of a\r\nperson, who was not an Inhabitant of the Town, that being at the\r\nSouth End on that Evening exactly at Eight o'Clock he saw there\r\nEleven Soldiers: An officer met them .....orderd them to appear at\r\ntheir respective places at the time: and if they should see any of\r\nthe Inhabitants of the Town, or any other people not belonging to\r\nthem, with Arms, Clubs or any other warlike weapon more than two\r\nbeing assembled together to order them to stop, & if they refusd,\r\nto stop them with their firelocks, and all that should take their\r\npart - the officer went Northward & the Soldiers Southward.\r\n\r\nThese were orders discretely given indeed! And well becoming a\r\nGentleman in any Command, over troops sent here, or as the\r\nMinister pretended, to aid the civil Magistrate in keeping the\r\npeace, & with directions never to act without . . . Will any one\r\nthink the Town could be safe, even from this band of Soldiers\r\nonly, especially while under such direction & influence - This is\r\na single Instance -No wonder that when the Bells soon after rang\r\nas for fire, & the people in that same part of the town came into\r\nthe Streets with Bucketts, they should be told by some, as a\r\nGentleman who was a Witness in Court for the prisoners swore they\r\nwere, that they had better bring Clubs than Bucketts - Such\r\nAppearances were enough to put the Town in Motion. It is a Mistake\r\nto say the Soldiers were in danger from the Inhabitants; the\r\nreverse is true: The Inhabitants were in danger from the Soldiers.\r\nWith all the Indulgence which was shown, and perhaps ought to be\r\nshown to Prisoners at the bar, upon trial for Life, not a single\r\nInstance was provd, of any Abuse offerd to any Soldier that\r\nEvening, previous to the insolent Behavior of those of them who\r\nrushd out of Murrays Barracks & fell upon all whom they met: on\r\nthe Contrary, there had been many Instances of their insulting &\r\nassaulting the Inhabitants indiscriminately in every part of the\r\nTown.\r\n\r\nAs it was said in Court that the unhappy persons who fell a\r\nSacrifice to the Cruel Revenge of the Soldiers, had brot their\r\nDeath upon their own heads, I shall finish this paper in saying\r\nwhat ought to be said in behalf of those who cannot now speak for\r\nthemselves. - Mr Maverick a young Gentleman of a good family & a\r\nblameless Life, was at Supper in the House of one of his friends,\r\nand went Out when the bells rang as for fire. .Mr Caldwell, young\r\nSeaman & of a good Character, had been at School to perfect\r\nhimself in the Art of Navigation, and had just returnd to the\r\nhouse of a reputable Person in this town to whose daughter he made\r\nhis visits with the honorable Intention of Marriage: He also went\r\nout when the bells rang. W Gray was of a good family, he was at\r\nhis own house the whole of the Evening, saving his going into a\r\nNeighbours house to borrow the News paper of the day & returning:\r\nHe went out on the ringing of the Bells; and altho a Child swore\r\nin Court that he saw him with a Stick after the bells rang, yet\r\nanother Witness saw him before he got into Kingstreet without a\r\nStick, Others saw him in Kingstreet & testified that he had no\r\nStick, and when he was shot, the Witness then testified, as is\r\nmentiond in a former paper, that he had no Stick & his Arms were\r\nfolded in his bosom; so that it is probable the young Witness\r\nmistook the person. Mr Attucks, it is said was at his Lodgings &\r\nat Supper when the bells rang; Witnesses indeed swore that they\r\nafterwards saw him with a Club, & great pains were taken to make\r\nit appear that he attackd the Soldiers, but the proof faild; even\r\nAndrew, a Negro Witness whom I shall hereafter mention, testifies\r\nthat he thot Attucks was the Man who struck one of the Soldiers,\r\nbut could not account how he could get at such a Distance, as he\r\nwas when he fell, the Soldier firing so soon. Others swear that he\r\nwas leaning on his Stick when he fell, which certainly was not a\r\nthreatning posture. It may be supposd that he had as good Right to\r\ncarry a Stick, even a Bludgeon, as the Soldier who shot him had,\r\nto be armd with Musquet & ball; & if he at any time lifted up his\r\nWeapon of Defence, it was surely not more than a Soldiers leveling\r\nhis Gun at the Multitude chargd with Death - If he had killed a\r\nSoldier, he might have been hangd for it, & as a traitor too, for\r\nto attack a Soldier upon his post, was declared Treason; But the\r\nSoldier shot Attucks & killed him, & he was convicted of Man\r\nSlaughter! As to Mr Car, the other deceasd person, it is doubtful\r\nwith what Intent he came out. He was at Mr Fields house when the\r\nBells rang; Mr Field & another Witness who was at the House,\r\ntestify that Car went upstairs and got his Sword.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 This article in the form as published is printed at pages 110-\r\n122.\r\n2 March 26.

I was the more brief, because there had been a\r\n\"Narrative of the horrid Massacre,\" printed by the Order of this\r\nTown; which was drawn up by a Committee appointed for that\r\npurpose, and reported by their Chairman, James Bowdoin, Esq. The\r\nAffidavits which are annexed to the Narrative, were each of them\r\ntaken before two Justices of the Peace, Quorum Unus, to perpetuate\r\nthe remembrance of the thing: Col. William Dalrymple, chief\r\nCommander of the Soldiers, was duly notified by the Justices to\r\nattend the Captions: And his Honor the lieutenant-governor,\r\ncertified under his hand with the Province Seal affixed, that full\r\nfaith and credit was, and ought to be given to the several Acts\r\nand Attestations of the Justices, both in Court and out. - It will\r\nbe own'd by the impartial World, that nothing could be fairer: I\r\nam not, however, at all surprized, to find, publish'd in a late\r\nNew-York Paper, a letter said to be written in this Town, in which\r\namong other chit-chat, it is asserted, that from the borders of\r\nConnecticut to Boston, there are people who \"exclaim against the\r\nTown for imposing on the Country by false Representations:\" This\r\nNarrative has been in a Manner adopted by the Province; for I am\r\nassured, that in the last Session of the General Assembly, the\r\nHouse of Representatives, generously granted to the Town a sum of\r\nMoney to defrey the Charge of a vessel, hired for no other Purpose\r\nbut to carry it to London; that his Majesty's Council concurr'd\r\nwith the House in the grant, and his Honor the lieutenant-governor\r\ngave his Assent to it. - Arts have been used, and are still using,\r\nto detach the rest of the Colonies from this Province; and the\r\nsame arts are every day practised, to divide the Towns in this\r\nProvince from the Capital. It is the Machiavellian Doctrine,\r\nDivide et impera -Divide and Rule: But the people of this Province\r\nand of this Continent are too wise, and they are lately become too\r\nexperienc'd, to be catch'd in such a snare. While their common\r\nRights are invaded, they will consider themselves, as embark'd in\r\nthe same bottom: And that Union which they have hitherto\r\nmaintain'd, against all the Efforts of their more powerful common\r\nEnemies, will still cement, notwithstanding such trifling letter\r\nwriters as these.\r\n\r\nThe candor of this Town was indeed such, that at their annual\r\nMeeting in March, by a vote, they restrain'd their Committee from\r\npublishing the Narrative here, altho' it was printed, lest it\r\nmight unduly prejudice those, whose Lot it might be, to be Jurors\r\nto try these Causes: This Restraint, they continued at their\r\nMeeting in May, and untill the Trials should be over.-A Caution,\r\nwhich all good Men will applaud: As it discover'd a sense of\r\nJustice; as well as the greatest Humanity towards those Men, who\r\nhad spilt the blood of Citizens, like Water upon the Ground! -A\r\ntemper far from vindictive - Calm and sedate, when it might have\r\nbeen expected, if ever, they would be off their guard. And yet so\r\nbarbarous and cruel, so infamously mean and base were the Enemies\r\nof this Town, who are the common Enemies of all America and of the\r\nTruth itself, that they had it falsely inserted in the public\r\nNews-Papers in London, that the Inhabitants had seiz'd upon Capt.\r\nPreston and hung him, like Porteus upon a sign-post!\r\n\r\nI shall now, in a few instances, endeavor to show, the temper\r\nwhich many of the Soldiers discover'd after the fatal Catastrophe\r\nwas over. The Reader may have observed, that I am careful to\r\ndistinguish, between the Evidence given in Court, from that which\r\nwas given out of Court: Witnesses to this point, it is not to be\r\nsuppos'd, were admissible at the Trial; unless perhaps the one\r\nimmediately following: This is a creditable person who is Mistress\r\nof a reputable family in the Town. She testified before the\r\nMagistrates, and was ready to swear it in Court, if she had been\r\ncalled, that on the Evening of the 5th of March, a number of\r\nSoldiers were assembled at Green's Barracks, and opposite to her\r\nGate, which is near those Barracks; that they stood very still,\r\nuntil the Guns were fired in King-Street; then they clapped their\r\nhands and gave a Cheer, saying, this is all we want; they then ran\r\nto their Barracks and came out again in a few minutes, all with\r\ntheir arms, and ran towards King-Street.1 - These Barracks are\r\nabout a quarter of a Mile from King-Street: Their standing very\r\nstill untill they heard the firing, compared with their subsequent\r\nConduct, looks as if they expected  it: It seems as tho' they knew\r\nwhat the signal should be, and the part they were to act in\r\nconsequence of it. This, perhaps, may be tho't by some to be too\r\nstraining: I will not urge it; but leave it to any one to judge,\r\nhow far, if at all, it affords grounds of Suspicion, that there\r\nwas an understanding, between the Soldiers in King-Street at the\r\ntime of the firing, and these; especially if it be true, as has\r\nbeen said, that they fired without the command of their officer.-\r\nThere was also a Witness, an householder of good reputation, whose\r\ntestimony was similar to this: That the Soldiers from Green's\r\nBarracks, on that Evening, rushed by him, with their arms, & ran\r\ntowards King-Street, saying, this is our time or chance; that he\r\nnever saw Dogs so greedy for their Prey, and the Serjeants could\r\nhardly keep them in their Ranks 2 - Another swore, that after\r\nthe firing, he saw the Soldiers drawn up under Arms, and heard the\r\nofficers, as they walked backwards and forwards say to one another,\r\nDamn it, what a fine fire that was! How bravely it dispers'd the Mob3\r\n- A gentleman belonging to Halifax in Nova Scotia testified that when\r\nthe body of Troops was drawn up before the guardhouse (which was\r\npresently after the Massacre) he heard an Officer say to another,\r\nthat this was fine work, just what he wanted!4 - I shall add but\r\none more to this list, and that is, the testimony of a Witness,\r\nwell known in this Town for an honest man; who declared that at\r\nabout one o'Clock the next morning, as he was going alone from his\r\nown House to the Town-House, he met a Serjeant of the 29th with\r\neight or nine Soldiers, all with very large Clubs and Cutlasses,\r\nwhen one of them, speaking of the Slaughter, swore by God, it was\r\na fine thing, and said, you shall see more of it.5 - To these I\r\ncannot help subjoining, the testimony of Mr. John Cox, a very\r\nreputable Inhabitant of this Town ; who swore in Court at one of\r\nthe late trials, that after the firing, he went to take up the\r\ndead; that he told the Soldiers, it was a cowardly trick in them\r\nto kill men within reach of their Bayonets, with nothing in their\r\nhands; and that the officer said, damn them, fire again, and let\r\nthem take the consequence - to which he replied, you have killed\r\nenough already to hang you all: But it has since appeared that he\r\nwas mistaken. - There are others, who saw, a very large party from\r\nthe Southguard, after the firing, take their post under Liberty-\r\nTree; by which one would think they intended to act the same part\r\nwhich the Soldiers in New-York had before done, as indeed some of\r\nthem had threatened they would, and which would probably have bro't on\r\na new scene of confusion. But the commanding officer, very prudently\r\nordered the regiment to be under arms, which prevented it.\r\n\r\nIf these testimonies would not have been pertinent to the issue of\r\nthe late trial, I think it necessary to adduce them here, to\r\nconvince the world of the wretched state this Town had been in;\r\nthe reason they had to apprehend, while such blood-thirsty inmates\r\nwere quarter'd among them ; and the necessity they were tinder,\r\nconstantly to be on their guard, while there were even such\r\nexultations at the barbarous \"action\" of the Evening.\r\n\r\nMuch was bro't into Court, to show that the Town was in a state of\r\ndisorder on that Evening, and previous to the Affray at Murray's\r\nBarracks; Witnesses were admitted to testify, that they had been\r\nmet by one and another arm'd with Clubs; but nothing appeared\r\nthere, to show the Cause and even the necessity of it: Thus, one\r\nof the prisoners witnesses testified in Court, that at seven\r\no'clock, going to the South-End of the Town, he met forty or fifty\r\nin small parties, four or five in a party; and divers others swore\r\nto the same purpose: They did not indeed say, whether they knew\r\nthem to be Inhabitants; it is as probable, that they were\r\nSoldiers, as inhabitants, if not more so; for it was sworn before\r\nthe Magistrates, by a person of credit, that on the Saturday\r\nbefore, he saw the Soldiers making Clubs.6 Another was ready to\r\ntestify in Court, that thirty of these Clubs or Bludgeons, were made\r\nby the Soldiers, in his own Shop. And in the part of the Town where\r\nthe before-mentioned witness was going, a gentleman was early in the\r\nEvening attacked by two Soldiers, one of them arm'd with a Club, and\r\nthe other with a broad Sword; the latter struck him, and threatned\r\nthat he should soon hear more of it.7 It was notorious, that the\r\nSoldiers were frequently seen on that Evening, arm'd with Clubs, as\r\nwell as other Weapons; and the night before, very late, it can be\r\nprov'd that forty or fifty of them were seen, thus arm'd, in several\r\nparts of the Town in terror of his Majesty's subjects: But in the\r\njudgment of some men, every party that was seen with Clubs, or in\r\nthe modern term, bludgeons, to be sure, must have been\r\ninhabitants. It had been testified, that on the Saturday before\r\nthe fifth of March, the Soldiers, had not only been seen making\r\ntheir Clubs, as is before mentioned, but from what the witness\r\ncould collect from their conversation, they were resolved to be\r\nreveng'd on the Monday.8 If they were in such danger, as some will\r\npretend they were, pray, why were they not kept in their Barracks,\r\nespecially after eight o'clock, according to their own rules?\r\nInstead of this, we find the testimony of a person, who was not an\r\ninhabitant of the Town: that being at the South-End on that Evening,\r\nexactly at Eight o'Clock, he saw there Eleven Soldiers; an officer\r\nmet them, and order'd them to appear at their respective places at\r\nthe time; and if they should see any of the inhabitants of the Town,\r\nor any other people not belonging to them, with Arms, Clubs or any\r\nother warlike Weapon, more than two being assembled together, to\r\norder them to stop: and if they refused, to stop them with their\r\nfirelocks, and all that should take their part - The officer went\r\nNorthward and the Soldiers Southward9 - Here were orders discretely\r\ngiven indeed! And well becoming a gentleman, in any command over\r\ntroops, sent here, as the Minister pretended, to aid the civil\r\nMagistrate in keeping the peace; and with directions never to act\r\nwithout one. Will any one suppose, that the Town could be safe, even\r\nfrom this band of Soldiers only; especially while under such\r\ndirection and influence. This is a single instance -No wonder that\r\nwhen the bells soon after rang as for fire, & the people in that\r\nsame part of the Town, came into the Street with their Buckets,\r\nthey were told by some, as a gentleman who was a witness in Court\r\nfor the prisoners said they were, that they had better bring their\r\nClubs than their Buckets - Such appearances were enough to put the\r\nTown in Motion - It is a glaring mistake to say, the Soldiers were\r\nin danger from the inhabitants: The reverse is true; the inhabitants\r\nwere in danger from the Soldiers. - With all the indulgence which\r\nwas shown, and perhaps ought to have been shown to prisoners at\r\nthe bar, upon trial for life, not a single instance was prov'd, of\r\nabuse offer'd to Soldiers that Evening, previous to the insolent\r\nbehavior of those who rush'd out of Murray's Barracks, with\r\nCutlasses, Clubs and other Weapons, and fell upon all whom they\r\nmet: On the contrary, there had been many instances of their\r\ninsulting and even assaulting the Inhabitants in every part of\r\nthe Town; and that without Discrimination ; which did not look, as\r\nif they design'd to seek revenge, for any former Quarrel, upon\r\nparticular persons.\r\n\r\nAs it was said, in Court that the unhappy Persons who fell a\r\nsacrifice to the cruel revenge of the Soldiers, had brought their\r\ndeath upon their own heads, I must not omit saying, what I think\r\nought to be said, in behalf of those who cannot now speak for\r\nthemselves - Mr. Maverick, a young gentleman of a good family and\r\na blameless life, was at supper in the house of one of his\r\nfriends, and went out when the Bells rang as for fire. Mr.\r\nCaldwell, a young seaman and of a good character, had been at\r\nSchool to perfect himself in the art of Navigation; and had just\r\nreturn'd to the house of a reputable person in this town, to whose\r\ndaughter he made his visits, with the honorable intention of\r\nMarriage: He also went out when the bells rang. Mr. Gray was of a\r\ngood family; he was at his own house the whole of the Evening,\r\nsaving his going to a neighbour's house to borrow the News-Paper\r\nof the day and returning; He went out on the ringing of the bells;\r\nand altho' a child swore in Court, that he saw him with a stick,\r\nafter the bells rang, yet another witness saw him before he got\r\ninto King-Street without a stick; others saw him in King-Street\r\nand testified that he had no stick; and when he was shot, the\r\nWitness at whose feet he fell, declared, as is mentioned in a\r\nformer Paper, that he had no stick, and his arms were folded in\r\nhis bosom; so that it is probable, the young Witness mistook the\r\nperson. Mr. Attucks, it is said, was at supper when the bells\r\nrang; he went out as others did, to enquire where the fire was; in\r\npassing thro' Dock-Square, he saw the affray at Murray's Barracks;\r\nand hearing a man say that if any one would join, he would drive\r\nthe Soldiers into the Barracks, he join'd; & they two were\r\nprincipally concerned in doing that piece of service. Great pains\r\nwere taken to make it appear that he attacked the Soldiers in\r\nKing-Street, but the proof fail'd: He was leaning upon his stick\r\nwhen he fell, which certainly was not a threatning posture: It may\r\nbe supposed that he had as good right, by the law of the land, to\r\ncarry a stick for his own and his neighbor's defence, in a time of\r\nsuch danger, as the Soldier who shot him had, to be arm'd with\r\nmusquet and ball, for the defence of himself and his friend the\r\nCentinel: And if he at any time, lifted up his weapon of defence,\r\nit was surely, not more than a Soldiers levelling his gun charg'd\r\nwith death at the multitude: If he had killed a Soldier, he might\r\nhave been hanged for it, and as a traitor too; for even to attack\r\na Soldier on his post, was pronounc'd treason: The Soldier shot\r\nAttucks, who was at a distance from him, and killed him,. - and he\r\nwas convicted of Manslaughter. - As to Mr. Carr, the other\r\ndeceas'd person, it is doubtful with what intent he came out: He\r\nwas at the house of one Mr. Field, when the bells rang; Mrs.\r\nField, and another witness who was at the house, declared that\r\nCarr went up Stairs, and got his Sword, which he put between his\r\nCoat and his Surtout, and it was with difficulty that they\r\nprevail'd upon him to lay by his Sword: They could not persuade\r\nhim to keep in: It does not appear that he took any part in the\r\ncontest of the Evening: He was soon shot: and tho' dead, he\r\nafterwards spoke in Court, by the mouth of another, in favour of\r\nthe prisoners; declaring among other things already mentioned,\r\nthat he was a native of Ireland, and had often seen mobs and\r\nSoldiers fire upon them there, but never saw them bear half so\r\nmuch before they fired as these did.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the Soldiers and of the people in King-Street,\r\nshall be the Subject of a future Paper. In the mean time, I must\r\ndesire Philanthrop, who appear'd in the last Evening Post, if he\r\npleases, to read again what I observ'd upon the case of Killroi in\r\nparticular, in this Gazette of the 17th Inst;1 and to consider,\r\nwhether he did me justice in saying, that I had publish'd \"the\r\nonly piece of Evidence produc'd against Killroi and argued upon\r\nthat alone:\" I then publish'd several material pieces of Evidence\r\nagainst him; and upon the whole concluded, that what was called\r\nthe furor brevis was, in my opinion, of rather too long - a\r\ncontinuance, to come within the indulgence of the law. I then\r\ntho't, and I believe I am far from being singular in thinking it;\r\nthat for a man repeatedly to say, that he had wanted an\r\nopportunity of firing upon the inhabitants ever since he had been\r\nin the Country and that he would never miss an opportunity of\r\ndoing it; and afterwards, when forewarn'd against it, to fire upon\r\nthe inhabitants, kill one man upon the spot, and then\r\nunrelentingly attempt to stab another, who had not offer'd him any\r\ninjury, all which was sworn in open Court: If such a man is not,\r\nhostis humanis generis, he discover'd at least, a total want of\r\nremorse at the shedding of human blood, as well as rancorous\r\nmalice from the beginning. Philanthrop further says, that \"there\r\nwas no evidence given in Court\" of the wound in Mr. Gray's head;\r\nand \"that it is, in the highest degree unjust, to blame the Court\r\nand jury for not regarding evidence which they never heard\": If he\r\nwill candidly recur to the aforementioned Paper he will find, that\r\nI expressly said, that the witness being out of the Province, the\r\nevidence of so savage an act of barbarity could not be produc'd in\r\nCourt; nor did I take it upon me to \"blame the Court and Jury for\r\nnot regarding it \" - \"I do not charge Philanthrop with a design\"\r\nto amuse his readers in this, or any other instance; but if he\r\nintends to continue the subject, I would advise him to be more\r\ncautious lest he misleads them for the future. Again he says \"the\r\nimpossibility of the bayonets being bloody the next morning, is\r\ndemonstrable from this, that every gun and bayonet of the party\r\nwas scowered clean that very night\"; but to borrow his own words\r\n\"it is certain no such evidence was given in Court\": If this could\r\nhave been proved, I dare say it would have been done without fail.\r\nPhilanthrop may suppose it to be true, from its being, as he says,\r\n\"the constant practice of the army after firing\"; but such a vague\r\nsupposition will not invalidate the oaths of creditable witnesses\r\nin open Court, who swore that Killroi's bayonet was bloody, five\r\ninches from the point.\r\n\r\nTo vilify and abuse \"the most amiable and respectable characters,\"\r\nI detest from the bottom of my heart: At the same time, I leave it\r\nto Philanthrop, or any one who pleases, to write Panegyricks, on\r\nthe living or the dead.\r\n\r\nVINDEX.\r\nDec. 25th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Narrative Appendix p. 68\r\n2 Idem p. 68\r\n3 Idem 69.\r\n4 Idem. 22.\r\n5 Idem.61\r\n6 Idem.4.\r\n7 Idem. 12.\r\n8 Idem. p. 4, This alludes to the affray at the Ropewalks: The\r\nSoldiers at Green's Barracks had made three attacks upon the\r\nRopemakers, while they were at work, in revenge, for one of them\r\nbeing told by a hand in the Walk that \"if he wanted work he might\r\nempty his Vault\": Enough, to enkindle the flame of resentment, in\r\nthe breast of a common Soldier, who of all men has the most delicate\r\nsentiments of Honor.

P. 48.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE SIGNED \"VINDEX.\"\r\n\r\n[Boston Gazette, December 31, 1770.]\r\n\r\nMessieurs PRINTERS.\r\n\r\nI Desire you would correct the following mistake I made in your\r\nlast paper. I said \"there were two only of the witnesses in the\r\nlate trial that made mention of the tall Gentleman in a red cloak\r\nand white wig, viz. Mr. Hunter and Mr. Selkrig\": In looking over\r\nmy minutes, I find there was another, viz. Mr. Archibald Bowman,\r\nwho also made mention of him. Mr. Bowman testified, that they (the\r\npeople in dock-square) \"stood thick round him some time, and after\r\ncried huzza for the main guard\"; in which he agreed with Mr.\r\nHunter: But he declared, that he did not remember their striking\r\ntheir sticks at Simpson's Store, & saying, they would do for the\r\nSoldiers, tho' Mr. Selkrig, who was with him at the same time,\r\ndeclared, that those words were spoken by numbers at Simpson's\r\nStore. Mr. Selkrig mention'd nothing of their saying huzza, &c.\r\nFrom all which we may conclude, that these cries were not general;\r\nespecially, as other witnesses declared that the people also cried,\r\nhome, home. Mr. David Mitchelson testified, that \"they cried, they\r\nwould go to the main guard, and that the effect soon followed\": But\r\nthey went not to the main guard, nor was the main guard attack'd thro'\r\nthe whole evening. He further said, the bells were ringing. - The\r\ntruth is, the generality of the people of the town thought there was\r\na fire; but not knowing where, they naturally, in passing thro' the\r\nmain streets, from the north and south parts of the town, stopped in\r\ndock square, which is in the center: There, they found there was\r\nnot fire; but that the soldiers at Murray's barracks, had, if I\r\nmay use the expression, broke loose. Mr. Selkrig said, that the\r\n[people] \"made unsuccessful attacks upon the barracks\"; but\r\nimmediately adds, \"that he saw nothing\" (of the attacks, I suppose;\r\nfor it was impossible he should see them, there being a stone\r\nbuilding between the house in which he was, and the barracks) but\r\nthat \"they went up the alley and came back suddenly\"; which\r\ncorresponds with what another of the prisoners witnesses said,\r\nwho was on the other side of the stone building, and therefore\r\ncould see; viz, that the soldiers several times presented their\r\nguns at the people: Mr. Selkrig must be candidly suppos'd to intend,\r\nthat he judg'd the people to have made attacks upon the barracks,\r\nand unsuccessfully, from seeing them retreat only: But his conclusion\r\nmight not be well grounded: It is as natural to conclude that these\r\nsudden retreats were occasioned by the soldiers attacking the people,\r\nas they had before done; and their levelling their guns and threatning\r\nto make a lane thro' them, as was sworn in open court. Mr. Dickson,\r\nwho was with Mr. Selkrig, and the other Scotch gentleman at Mr.\r\nHunter's house, declared, that \"a party came running down the alley,\r\nas if they had met with opposition there\"; which confirms what Mr.\r\nSelkrig had said of their sudden retreats, and strengthens the\r\nsupposition I have now made.\r\n\r\nBut the writer in Mr. Draper's paper of the 20th Instant, has not\r\nyet fulfilled his promise to \"ascertain the person\" in a red\r\ncloak: I am sollicitous that the publick should know the very man;\r\nand the rather, because it has been impudently insinuated, that he\r\nwas a gentleman in office in this town.\r\n\r\nVINDEX.\r\nDec. 27.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE SIGNED “VINDEX.\"\r\n\r\n[Boston Gazette, January 7, 1771]\r\n\r\nTo the PRINTERS.\r\n\r\nI Have taken occasion to mention the unhappy persons, who lost\r\ntheir lives on the fatal fifth of March And I think it must appear\r\nto every candid reader, that they were totally unconnected with\r\neach other; and that it cannot be even suspected, that either, or\r\nto be sure, more than one of them had any ill intention in coming\r\nabroad on that evening; much less, that they were combin'd\r\ntogether to do any sort of mischief: Nay, it is even to be\r\ndoubted, whether they ever had any knowledge of each other. I will\r\nfurther observe, that there was not the shadow of evidence to\r\nprove, that any other persons, excepting the Soldiers, had form'd a\r\ndesign to commit disorders at that or any other time: Unless credit\r\nis to be given in a court of law, to the hearsay of an hearsay; the\r\nstory which one man told another at sea, and months after the facts\r\nwere committed: Evidence which was in vain objected to by the council\r\nfor the crown; but to the honor of one of the prisoners council was\r\nby him interrupted and stopped. This worthy gentleman declared in\r\nopen court that it was not legal, and that it ought not to have the\r\nleast weight in the minds of the jurors; upon which it was ruled,\r\nthat the witness should proceed no further, and he was dismiss'd.\r\n\r\nI come now to consider the tragical scene, as it was acted in\r\nKing-street; in doing which, I shall confine myself chiefly, to\r\nthe evidence as it was given in court: If I vary from the truth,\r\nlet Philanthrop, or any one else correct me; it is far from my\r\ndesign: And I am willing to appeal for facts, to the book which\r\nPhilanthrop has told us of; provided always, that the facts are\r\nthere stated with impartiality and truth: This I think it\r\nnecessary to premise, because I find it advertiz'd, that the book\r\nis to be publish'd, not by the direction, but with the permission\r\nof the court: A distinction, which appears to me to be of some\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nIt may be necessary, first to enquire into the situation the\r\ncentinel was in, for whose relief the party was said to have\r\nafterwards gone down. By the testimony given in court, by Col.\r\nMarshall, who had spent the evening at a friend's house in dock-\r\nsquare, it appears that at nine o'clock all was quiet there; and\r\npassing thro' Royal - exchange lane into King street, where the\r\ncentry was, he found all as peaceable there; \"the street never\r\nclearer,\" was his expression. It is probable that very soon after\r\nthis, the difference arose between the centry and the barber's\r\nboy; for Col. Marshall testified, that some time after, he heard a\r\ndistant cry of murder; and it is without doubt the centry struck\r\nthe boy, with his gun, - It was then that Colonel Marshall saw a\r\nparty turn out from the main-guard, and soon after another party\r\nrush'd thro' Quaker-lane, all arm'd - It is probable, that these\r\nwere the Soldiers who, as they ran into Cornhill, abus'd the\r\npeople there, as I have before mention'd: Upon the appearance of\r\nthese parties, it is said, that the barber's boy, and his fellow-\r\napprentice, ran either into his Master's or a neighbor's shop. -\r\nMr. William Parker, one of the prisoner's witnesses declared, that\r\nwhen he came into King street, which was after the affray began at\r\nMurray's barracks, all was quiet and peaceable: But presently the\r\nbarber's boy, with two or three more, came to the centry - they\r\npush'd one another against him (in resentment it is to be suppos'd\r\nfor) they said, he had knock'd the boy down - In the trial of\r\nCapt. Preston, the boy himself swore in Court, that the centry had\r\nstruck him with his bayonet. Mr. Parker adds, that presently a\r\nnumber, about fifteen, came thro' Silsby's lane, which leads from\r\nMurray's barracks, with sticks like pieces of pine in their hands\r\n- The most of them small boys, 1 or 2 of them large lubbers, as he\r\ncalled them - they said, let us go to the main-guard; by which it\r\ndoes not appear that they interested themselves in the dispute\r\nwith the centry, nor does it appear that they molested the main-\r\nguard, if they went up to it - Soon after, five or six more came\r\nup Royal exchange lane, which also leads from Murray's barracks,\r\nwith sticks like the others; but neither did the witness say, that\r\nthese interfered with the centry - Mr. Parker further said, that\r\nhe went up by Mr. Jackson's corner, and met twenty or thirty more\r\ncoming out of Cornhill, a good many men among them, some with\r\nsticks and some with walking canes - These opened the matter to\r\nhim; and told him there had been a squabble at Murray's barracks,\r\nbut that the Soldiers were driven in, and all was over. -  These\r\ndifferent parties met in a cluster, at and near Quaker lane, and\r\nnot long after seem'd to disperse; and he soon went off himself,\r\nnot leaving above twelve or fifteen in the street: And, just as he\r\ngot home, which might not be more than ten minutes, he heard the\r\nbells ring, and the guns discharg'd - No one I believe will\r\ndispute the veracity, either of Col. Marshall or Mr. Parker\r\nMr Edward Payne, a merchant of note in this town, was also\r\nsummoned as a witness for the prisoners, and his testimony will\r\nundoubtedly be rely'd upon, by all who know him or his character.\r\nMr. Payne came out after Mr. Parker left the street; for he\r\ndeclared in Court, that at 20 minutes after nine, when the bells\r\nrang, he went out into the street, and was told, as Mr. Parker had\r\nbeen, that the soldiers had sallied out of their barracks, and had\r\ncut & wounded a number, but were driven in again - He declared\r\nthat the centinel was walking by himself, and no body near him -\r\nso that the barber's boy and his three or four comrades, were at\r\nthat time gone off - He heard a considerable noise in Cornhill,\r\nand a noise of people coming up Silsby's alley - they were\r\ninhabitants: Fourteen or fifteen, perhaps twenty, passed by him,\r\nsome with sticks, others without; as many of the latter as the\r\nformer - They cried where are they? It is necessary to connect the\r\ncircumstances, as the facts are related: Here therefore I will\r\nremind the reader, that besides the Soldiers that came out of\r\nMurray's barracks, and who now may be suppos'd to have been driven\r\nin, there was also a party that had issued from the main guard,\r\nand another party of Soldiers who came thro' Quaker-lane, all\r\narm'd with naked cutlasses, &c. who went into Cornhill not long\r\nbefore, and there insulted every person they met: These were the\r\nmen whom the persons mentioned by Mr. Payne, in all probability\r\nrefer'd to, when they cried, where are they. -  Certainly no\r\npersons could be tho't blame-worthy, for pursuing a banditti, who\r\nhad already put a number of peaceable people in great terror of\r\ntheir lives, with a design to prevent their doing further mischief:\r\nThere is no foundation to suppose, that they had any other design:\r\nYet these are the persons, who, as some would have it, were the\r\nfaulty cause of the slaughter, that afterwards ensued: It was\r\nindeed unfortunate that they happened to take that rout; for Mr.\r\nPayne added, that a lad came up and said, that the centry had\r\nknock'd down a boy, upon which the people turn'd about, and went\r\ndirectly to the centry: By which, one would think, that they had\r\nno design to attack the centry before: and that they would not\r\neven have spoken to him, had they not been told that he had\r\ninjured the boy: Till then, the centry had not been the object of\r\ntheir attention; and I must insist upon it, that they had then as\r\ngood right by the law, to resent the injury done to the boy, as\r\nthe party from the main-guard had afterwards, to resent the injury\r\ndone, if there was any, to the centry - The prudence in either\r\ncase I will not undertake to vindicate - Mr. Payne further said,\r\nhe was afraid of what might happen from the peoples surrounding\r\nthe centry, and wished they might be taken off - He returned to\r\nhis own door, which is nearly on the opposite side of the street,\r\nand there heard the people cry to the centry, fire, damn you, why\r\ndon't you fire. - I have just observ'd, that Mr. Payne expressed\r\nhis concern at the peoples surrounding the centry: Mr. Henry Knox,\r\nanother witness for the prisoners, a young gentleman of a very\r\ngood reputation, was probably near the centry while Mr. Payne was\r\nat his own door - He testified in court, that the people were\r\nround the centry, and they said he was going to fire - That he was\r\nwaving his gun- That he (Mr. Knox) told him, if he fired he must\r\ndie - That in return he damn'd them, and said, that if they\r\nmolested him, he would fire - That the boys were damning him and\r\ndaring him     to fire - That he heard one say he would go and\r\nknock him down for sweeping (his gun) - that he thought the centry\r\nsnapped - He added that he saw nothing thrown at the centry,\r\naltho' he was near him till after the party came down and Mr.\r\nPayne finished his testimony with saying, that he perceived\r\nnothing but the talk that led him to think the Soldiers would fire.\r\n\r\nMr. Leigh, and Mr. Frost, both witnesses for the prisoners,\r\ntestified, that the barber's boy came up to the people, and\r\npointing at the centry, said, here 's the son of a b--ch that\r\nknocked me down; upon which one of the witnesses said, the people\r\ncried kill him - Both said, that the centry ran to the custom-\r\nhouse steps, knocked at the door, but could not get in - neither\r\nof them mention'd any thing thrown at him, nor any attack upon him\r\n- he prim'd and loaded his gun and levelled it; told the people to\r\nstand off, and called to the main-guard; upon which Capt. Preston\r\nand his party came down - Mr. Bulkly, summoned also by the\r\nprisoners, testified that he thought the centry was in danger, by\r\nthe number of people about him, and the noise; and mentioned no\r\nother reason for his thinking so - he said that a person told\r\nCapt. Preston, that they were killing the centry - This person was\r\nprobably one Thomas Greenwood, a servant in the custom-house; for\r\nhe himself declared before the magistrates, that he was in the\r\ncustom-house, and went from thence to the main-guard, and told one\r\nof the Soldiers, if they did not go down to the centry, he was\r\nafraid they would hurt him, tho' he had not seen any person insult\r\nhim - This man, at the same time depos'd, that he saw two or three\r\nsnow balls fall near the steps of the custom-house, but saw no\r\nperson throw any stones; tho' he had placed himself in the most\r\nconvenient room in the house for observation - Mr. Harrison Gray\r\nmention'd the people round the centry, making use of opprobrious\r\nlanguage, and threatening; but said nothing of their attacking\r\nhim, or throwing anything at him - Mr. Hinckley declared, that the\r\npeople went to the centry, and at last some of them cried kill\r\nhim, but did not see any attempt to hurt him - Mr. Cornwall swore,\r\nthat he saw snow balls and 2 or 3 oyster shells thrown at the\r\ncentry, but did not think they hit him - he heard several young\r\ngentlemen perswading the people to go off, and believed they all\r\nwould have gone off, if the Soldiers had not come down - Mr.\r\nHelyer declared, that he came into King-street, and saw the centry\r\nand twenty or thirty persons - some boys at their diversion - The\r\ncentry wav'd his gun in a way that had a tendency to exasperate\r\nthe people - Mr. Brewer saw the centry with his bayonet breast\r\nhigh - a number of boys, twenty or more round him, talking but\r\ndoing nothing. Mr. Bailey was standing with the centry on the\r\ncustom-house steps - saw 20 or 30 boys of about 14 years old -\r\nthey were throwing pieces of ice at him, large and hard enough to\r\nhurt him, but did not know whether they hit him. This must appear\r\nvery strange as he was so near him - his standing with him on the\r\nsteps, would lead one to think he was an acquaintance of the\r\ncentry; which is confirmed by another circumstance, for he said\r\nthat when the party came down, one of the Soldiers put his bayonet\r\nto his breast, and the centry told him not to hurt him - Mr.\r\nSimpson swore, that the centry knock'd at the customhouse door -\r\nthat a person came to the door and spoke to him, upon which he\r\nturn'd and loaded his gun - There was one witness, and I think but\r\none, who mention'd pieces of sea-coal thrown at the centry; and\r\nthat was Andrew a Negro - A fellow of a lively imagination indeed!\r\n- One, who I believe could tell as good a story even to my lord of\r\nH. and give his lordship as circumstantial an account of \"the\r\nunhappy transaction\", as some, who have already had the honor of\r\ndoing it, & who may think themselves to be Andrew's betters - he\r\nis remarkable for telling romantick stories in the circles of his\r\nacquaintance - And whether his fancy had beguil'd his own\r\njudgment, or whether he had a mind to try his success at painting\r\nupon so serious an occasion, or lastly, whether he was resolv'd to\r\ndo his utmost to save the prisoners, I pretend not to say; but he\r\ncertainly made some folks believe, that the ashes made of sea-coal\r\nburnt with great savings in the adjacent offices, were like the\r\ncinders thrown out of a blacksmith's shop -Andrew's evidence, if\r\nnot his judgment, was greatly rely'd upon; and the more, because\r\nhis master, who is in truth an honest man, came into court and\r\nswore to his character; and further said, that Andrew had told\r\nhim, that He really believ'd the inhabitants were to blame - It\r\nis, I am apt to think, in general true, that no man knows so\r\nlittle of the real character of his servant, as the master himself\r\ndoes: It is well known, that the Negroes of this town have been\r\nfamiliar with the soldiers; and that some of them have been\r\ntamper'd with to cut their master's throats: I hope Andrew is not\r\none of these. His character for integrity and even for learning,\r\nfor he can both read & write, has been upon this occasion wrought\r\nto so high a pitch, that I am loth even to hint any thing that may\r\ntend to depreciate it; otherwise, I should say, that there are\r\nsome, whose kitchens Andrew has frequented, who will not give him\r\nquite so exalted a character, as others, who had not known him,\r\nthought he deserved. - Several others, witnesses for the prisoners\r\ntestified to the same purpose; that the people encroach'd upon the\r\ncentry; that he loaded his gun and threatned to fire upon them;\r\nand that they in return dared him to fire, and throw'd a few snow\r\nballs. Mr. Hall said, that he presented his gun at the people, and\r\nthey threw snow balls and some oyster-shells at him; and they hit\r\nhis gun two or three times - Mr. Payne who saw the centry when he\r\nwas alone, and until the party came up and fired, \"perceived\r\nnothing but the talk, that he thought would have induced him or\r\nany of the Soldiers to fire\": Words are not an assault, and could\r\nnot warrant him to fire: Mr. Knox and others saw nothing thrown at\r\nhim nor any attack made on him: Mr.-----and some others said, they\r\nsaw snow balls and other things thrown at him; but it appears very\r\nprobable, from the course of the evidence, that if any thing was\r\nthrown at him, it was not till he had loaded his gun, threatened\r\nto fire, & waved it in such a manner as tended to exasperate\r\npeople; and as Mr. Knox tho't, had snapped his gun. The first\r\nassault was made by the centry himself, when upon a foolish\r\nprovocation in words only, he struck the barber's boy: He renewed\r\nthe assault, when he loaded his gun and presented it upon the\r\npeople, threatning to fire upon them: In doing this, he put his\r\nMajesty's subjects in terror of their lives, against the law of\r\nthe land; and they would have been justified in seizing him at\r\nleast - If he had thought himself in danger, instead of threatning\r\nthe lives of others, he must first, according to the law of the\r\nland, have retreated if he could, and even from his post: Other\r\ndoctrine, I know, has been strongly inculcated of late, by those\r\nwho would set up, or tamely yield to, an uncontroulable military\r\npower; but I trust in God, it will never be established here: It\r\nnever can, while the people entertain a just idea of the nature of\r\ncivil government, and are upon their guard against the daring\r\nencroachments of arbitrary, despotic power. The people were\r\ninclin'd to disperse, and did disperse, in the beginning of this\r\nchildish dispute; as appeared by the evidence of Mr. Parker: And\r\nnotwithstanding the mutual animosity, if the reader pleases, which\r\nafterwards arose between the centry and them, they would have\r\nfinally dispers'd, in the opinion of another witness, if the party\r\nhad not come down from the main-guard.\r\n\r\nVINDEX.\r\nJan. i.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO STEPHEN SAYRE.\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\nBOSTON Jany 12 1771\r\n\r\nSIR\r\n\r\nI wrote you p Capt Hall who saild about ten days ago, & then\r\ninclosd, some papers publishd in the Boston Gazette upon the\r\nSubject of the late Trial of the Soldiers.

Some of the\r\nwitnesses, sworn in open court, who I believe, are allow'd to be\r\nof equal credit with any of the rest, and were present thro' the\r\nwhole bloody scene, declared, that they perceived nothing thrown\r\nat the centry - Nothing but the number of people and the noise\r\nthey made, that led them to apprehend he was in danger - Nothing\r\nbut the talk, that induc'd them to think he would fire: Others\r\nindeed saw snow balls, and other things thrown at him, after he\r\npresented his gun, and wav'd it in an exasperating manner,\r\nand threatened to fire: - One in particular, declared, that he saw\r\nballs of ice thrown, large & hard enough to hurt any man: It is\r\nstrange, if he thought the centry in danger, that he should stand\r\nso near him, as by his own testimony it is evident he did, till\r\nthe Soldiers came down: I think, upon the whole, we may fairly\r\nconclude, that but few of these things were thrown at him; and\r\nthat they were in consequence of his loading his gun, & presenting\r\nit at the people: It was the opinion of one of the witnesses for the\r\nprisoners, that the people would have dispersed, if the soldiers had\r\nnot come down: It was then unfortunate, that the soldiers were so\r\nsuddenly order'd down. Whether it was regular, for a captain to take a\r\ncorporal's command, or was ever done before in the army, I leave\r\nothers to say, who are better acquainted with the art military,\r\nthan I pretend to be: If not, it may be difficult to account for\r\nCapt. Preston's great readiness to undertake so disagreable and\r\ndangerous a task.\r\n\r\nIn the publick Advertiser, printed in London, the 28th of April\r\nlast, I have seen a paper called, the Case of Capt. Thomas\r\nPreston: It was published in his name, tho' not wholly his own\r\ndraft; as he declared to a committee of this town, who waited upon\r\nhim for an explanation of some passages in it,1 which were\r\nnotoriously false, and grosly reflecting upon some of the\r\nmagistrates, as well as the people of the town and province. I may\r\nhereafter particularly consider this paper, which has had its run\r\nthro' Britain and America; and point out\r\nthe many \"faults of partiality\" which are contain'd in it: The\r\nonly reason why I have not already done it, was, because I agreed\r\nin the general sentiment of the inhabitants of this town, that\r\nnothing of this kind should be publish'd, at so critical a\r\njuncture, lest it might be tho't to prejudice the minds of Jurors\r\non a trial for life.2- It may be perhaps more easy, and of full\r\nas much importance to the publick, to ascertain the person, who\r\nseveral times alter'd the state of the case; and, as Capt. Preston\r\nhimself declared, even after it finally came out of his hands, as\r\nit would be, to ascertain the person in a red cloke; which the\r\nwriter in Draper's paper has been so often in vain called upon to\r\ndo, in fulfillment of his voluntary promise. - In this paper,\r\nCapt. Preston, or his friend in his behalf, says, \"he sent a non-\r\ncommission'd officer and twelve men, and very soon follow'd\r\nhimself:\" The witnesses in court, on both sides declared, that\r\nCapt. Preston himself came down with the party. Again he says, he\r\nfollowed, \"lest the officer and soldiers should be thrown off\r\ntheir guard, and commit some rash act\": But, did he restrain them\r\nfrom commiting so rash an act, as firing upon the multitude? - He\r\nsurely must have observ'd the violent temper which the soldiers\r\ndiscover'd, as \"they rushed thro' the people\" according to his own\r\naccount; \"upon the trot, in a threatning manner, damning the\r\npeople and pushing them with their bayonets\", as Mr. Knox and\r\nothers swore in court: He knew their guns were charg'd with ball;\r\nhe declar'd it at the time, and on the spot, as Mr. Palmes testified:\r\nShould he not then, at the very instant, when he must if ever, have\r\nbeen apprehensive, that they would commit some rash act, at least\r\nhave caution'd them, not to fire, till he himself should give the\r\norders? Instead of this, by his own, or his friend's account,\r\npublish'd as his own, we find no such prudent directions to the men\r\nunder his command; who by the rules of the army, would have been\r\nliable to suffer death, if they had disobey'd! What single step did\r\nhe take, to prevent their committing a rash act, for the sake of which\r\nalone, he tells us, he followed down? Not one according to the state\r\nof his case, till after they began to fire: \"Upon my asking the men,\r\nsays he, why they fired without orders, they said, they heard the\r\nword, fire, and suppos'd it come from me\": It seems, it was the\r\napprehension of the Soldiers, that he order'd them to fire; and we\r\nmust suppose, that the Soldiers were particularly attentive to their\r\ncommanding officer: But he adds, \"I assured them my words were,\r\ndon't fire\"; from hence it is plain that he gave them some order.\r\nI am no Soldier, and never desire to be one: But I appeal to those\r\nwho are, whether the words, \"don't fire,\" are words of command in\r\nthe British army; and whether there is not some other word which\r\nSoldiers are taught to understand, more proper to be given on such\r\nan occasion, or, as I chuse to express it, in the heat of action,\r\nwhich would have prevented such rashness, and even put it out of\r\ntheir power to have fired, at least to have done any mischief.\r\nThese words, I well remember, it was said were made use of in\r\ncommand, at another time, and by another officer of the same\r\nregiment; when one of the soldiers, thro' mistake, fired upon the\r\nmarch, in the street, and very nearly effected the death; not to\r\nsay, the murder of a worthy citizen: The soldier was soon jostled\r\nfrom the reach of civil power; which was a mighty easy thing to be\r\ndone, as was found by experience, at a time when the first\r\nmagistrate of the province had publickly declared, that he had no\r\nauthority over the King's troops, which has since been repeated:\r\nThe good men of the county however, found a bill of indictment\r\nagainst the officer who commanded the party: But when the matter\r\ncame upon trial before the superior court, altho' some positively\r\nswore that he gave the word, fire, yet because the soldiers swore\r\nthat his words were don't fire, a doubt arose; and a doubt you\r\nknow, must turn in favor of the accused party; for the good old\r\nmaxim is, whether founded in the law of Moses, the common law, the\r\nlaw of nature and reason, or the safety of human societies, better\r\nten villains escape than one honest, harmless man be hang'd-\r\nWhether the officer would have so luckily escaped, upon a trial\r\nbefore a court martial, for giving a word of command,\r\nunintelligible in a military sense, I very much doubt.. - Capt.\r\nPreston further said, that \"his intention was not to act\r\noffensively, nor even the contrary part, without compulsion\": That\r\nis, when he should think himself compelled, he was to act defensively;\r\nand in what way could he or his soldiers act upon the defence, with\r\nmuskets charg'd with ball, but by discharging them upon the people,\r\nwhich he must have concluded would have kill'd some of them? No\r\nmatter, the people were the agressors; and besides, \"the King's money\r\nwas to be protected\" as well as the centinel - Here I will acquit\r\nCapt. Preston, as a man of too much honor to suggest a known falshood:\r\nIt has been the constant practice of a certain set of men, meanly to\r\ninsinuate, that the Americans in their exertions against lawless\r\npower, have always had something dishonorable in view: At present, it\r\nis the plundering the King's chest; altho' even Greenwood himself, an\r\nhired servant in the custom-house, a dependent upon dependents, if\r\nhe is to be believed, depos'd before the magistrate, that amidst\r\nthe whole volley, as some would have it, of snow balls, oyster\r\nshells, ice, and as Andrew said, sea coal, thrown at the centinel,\r\n\"not a single Pane of the custom-house windows were broken; nor\r\ndid he see any person attempt to get into the house, or break even\r\na square of glass \" - The soldiers acted defensively, and it seems\r\nas tho' Preston thought they were at length compelled to do it;\r\nfor if it was done against his orders, or barely without his\r\norders, with what propriety could he say to the person of the\r\nfirst character in the province, \"I did it to save my men,\" - A\r\nprecise answer indeed, to the question put to him; and therefore,\r\nI should have thought, not \"unsatisfactory,\" or \"imperfect \", as\r\nit was afterwards affirmed to have been.\r\n\r\nSuch were the effects of Capt. Preston's sending the non-\r\ncommission'd officer and the soldiers to protect the centinel and\r\nthe King's money; and of his following very soon after, to prevent\r\ntheir committing a rash act: But if Capt. Preston had a right to\r\ngo to the protection of any man whom he thought in danger, had he or\r\nhis party a right to engage in an affray, and carry into an incensed\r\nmob, as he calls it, weapons which could not be used without killing,\r\nand there make use of them as he should judge necessary? Ought he not\r\nto have called upon a civil officer, and put himself, and his men, if\r\nrequired, under his direction, before he went upon so desperate a\r\ndesign? Or, does the law of the land, invest every, or any military\r\nofficer, even of the highest rank, with the right, above all other\r\ncitizens, of making himself a party in a riot, under a pretence of\r\nsuppressing it; of carrying with him soldiers arm'd with weapons of\r\ndeath, and making use of them at discretion, without even the presence\r\nof a civil officer - This is a point of too much importance to be\r\nyielded; for the lives of subjects are not to depend, upon the\r\njudgment or discretion, much less upon the will and pleasure, or\r\nwanton humour of his Majesty's military servants.\r\n\r\nI am sensible, I have heretofore taken up too much room in your\r\nuseful paper: I shall avoid it at present; and the rather, to\r\nafford you the opportunity of inserting an address \"to the\r\nPROTESTANTS of the three Kingdoms, and the COLONIES\"; being the\r\npreface to a late publication in London, containing a series of\r\nimportant letters of the Earl of Hillsborough, the Marquiss of\r\nRockingham, and others, from a gentleman whose signature is Pliny,\r\njunior.\r\n\r\nVINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n1 See above, page 14\r\n.\r\n2 See above, page 102.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE SIGNED \"VINDEX.\"\r\n\r\n[Boston Gazette, January 21, 1771.]\r\n\r\nTo the PRINTERS.\r\n\r\nAs the lives of five of his Majesty's subjects were unfairly lost\r\non the evening of the 5th of March last, it follows that some\r\npersons must have been in fault:\r\n\r\nThe unhappy sufferers, for ought that has ever appeared, were in\r\nthe peace of God and the King; let their memories then, so far at\r\nleast as respects this matter, remain unreproach'd. It appeared by\r\nthe evidence in court, that all the prisoners were present in king\r\nstreet; that they all discharg'd their musquets but one, and his\r\nflush'd in the pan; and that the deceas'd were all kill'd by\r\nmusquet balls. Six of the prisoners were acquitted by the jury,\r\nand two were found guilty of manslaughter. In ordinary cases, the\r\npublick ought to rest satisfied, with the verdict of a jury; a\r\nmethod of trial, which an Englishman glories in as his greatest\r\nsecurity: It is a method peculiar to the English; and as a great\r\nwriter observes, has been a probable means of their having\r\nsupported their liberties thro' so many ages past: Among the most\r\nsubstantial advantages arising from trials by juries, there is\r\nthis incidental one, in this province especially; that by our\r\nlaws, no man being oblig'd to serve as a juryman more than once in\r\nthree years, it falls upon the freemen as it were by rotation; by\r\nthis means, the people in general are in their turns called to\r\nthat important trust; by attending in courts of law and justice,\r\nit is to be presum'd that their minds are there impress'd with a\r\nsense of justice; and that they gain that general idea of right or\r\nlaw, which it is necessary that all men in a free country should\r\nhave. \"It is an admirable institution, by which every citizen may\r\nbe plac'd in a situation, that enables him to contribute to the\r\ngreat end of society, the distributing justice; and it every where\r\ndiffuses a spirit of true patriotism, which is zealously employed\r\nfor the publick welfare.\" I am not about to arraign the late\r\njurors before the bar of the publick: They are accountable to God\r\nand their own consciences, and in their day of trial, may God send\r\nthem good deliverance. But in times when politicks run high, we\r\nfind by the experience of past ages, it is difficult to ascertain\r\nthe truth even in a court of law: At such times, witnesses will\r\nappear to contradict each other in the most essential points of\r\nfact; and a cool conscientious spectator is apt to shudder for\r\nfear of perjury: If the jurors are strangers to the characters of\r\nthe several witnesses, it may be too late for them to make the\r\nenquiry, when they are upon their seats: The credibility of a\r\nwitness perhaps cannot be impeac'd in court, unless he has been\r\nconvicted of perjury: But an immoral man, for instance one who\r\nwill commonly prophane the name of his maker, certainly cannot be\r\nesteemed of equal credit by a jury, with one who fears to take\r\nthat sacred name in vain: It is impossible he should in the mind\r\nof any man: Therefore, when witnesses substantially differ in\r\ntheir relation of the same facts, unless the jury are acquainted\r\nwith their different characters, they must be left to meer chance\r\nto determine which to believe; the consequence of which, may be\r\nfatal to the life of the prisoner, or to the justice of the cause,\r\nor perhaps both. It was for this reason, that I was concern'd,\r\nwhen the council for the crown objected the notoriety of the\r\nimmoral character of a witness, that he was stopped by one of the\r\ncouncil on the other side. In a court of justice, it is beneath\r\nany character to aim at victory and triumph: Truth, and truth\r\nalone is to be sought after.\r\n\r\nWhile the soldiers were passing from the main guard to the custom-\r\nhouse, it did not appear by any of the witnesses, that they were\r\nmolested by the people; if we except what was mention'd, as having\r\nbeen said by Mr. Car, one of the deceased persons: His doctor\r\ntestified, that he told him, the \"people pelted them as they went\r\nalong\". - The declaration of a dying man commonly carries much\r\nweight, and oftentimes, possibly more than it ought: This man's\r\ndeclaration was not made upon oath, nor in the presence of a\r\nmagistrate: The doctor had a curiosity, as most had, to know how\r\nmatters were, and enquired of his patient who he thought could\r\ninform him; it may be, not expecting to be called to relate it\r\nbefore a court, nine months afterwards, when he might have nothing\r\nbut memory to recur to: No one disputes the doctor's understanding\r\nor integrity: I have before said, that others were ready to\r\ntestify, that Car gave them a very different account from that\r\nwhich he gave to his doctor: It ought to be remembered, that the\r\nunhappy man was laboring under the pains and anxiety occasioned by\r\na mortal wound; and might not be able at all times to attend duly\r\nto such questions as were asked him: What makes it highly probable\r\nthat he must have been mistaken, is, that among the many\r\nwitnesses, not one on either side, mention'd their seeing the\r\nleast ill usage offer'd to the soldiers as they pass'd from the\r\nmain guard; not even Mr. Gridley, whose declared intention was, at\r\nthe request of some gentlemen, with whom he had been in company,\r\nto\r\n\r\nIt is agreed by the witnesses for the prisoners, who mention'd\r\ntheir seeing the soldiers upon their first coming down, that they\r\nloaded their guns, levelled them at the people & began to insult &\r\nabuse them, (as indeed they did upon their march); before any just\r\nprovocation had been offer'd to them. - Mr. Hinckley saw the party\r\ncome down - they loaded - push'd their bayonets and pricked the\r\npeople - Mr. Wilkinson also saw the party come down; did not see\r\nanything thrown at them, tho' he stood at two or three yards\r\ndistance - Mr. Murray said they came down and cried make way -\r\nAndrew declared, that the party planted themselves at the custom-\r\nhouse - the people gave three cheers - he heard one of the\r\nsoldiers say, damn you stand back - one of them had like to have\r\nprick'd a man as he was passing by, and swore by God he would stab\r\nhim - several persons were talking with the captain, and a number\r\npressing on to hear what they said; one of the persons talking\r\nwith the officer said \"he is going to fire\"; the people shouted\r\nand said, he dare not fire; and then they began to throw snow\r\nballs. Even by Andrews account, the people were rather curious to\r\nknow what the soldiers design'd to do, than intent upon doing\r\n\r\nthem any hurt, untill they were assaulted by them; which I am apt to\r\nthink is true; because Newtown Prince, another Negro, of whom for my\r\nown part I conceive a better opinion than of Andrew, declared, that\r\nthe Soldiers planted themselves in a circle - their guns breast high\r\n-and, the people crowded on, to speak with Capt. Preston - and\r\nfurther, several of the witnesses swore that they themselves talked\r\nwith the Captain, and one of them caution'd him against firing\r\n- Capt. Preston himself also in his printed state of his case says,\r\nthat he reasoned with \"some well behav'd persons\": To show that \"as\r\nhe was advanced before the muzzels of their pieces, he must fall a\r\nsacrifice if they fired \" -and that his ordering them to fire \"upon\r\nthe half cock and charged bayonets would prove him no officer\"; all\r\nwhich might be true, and yet in my humble opinion not quite so\r\n\"satisfactory\" as the answer which he afterwards gave to the\r\nLieutenant Governor; for he might, I suppose, in an instant shift his\r\nstation, and the soldiers, by a proper word of Command, might\r\ndischarge their musquets without his falling a sacrifice or forfeiting\r\nthe character of a soldier - Such a manner of reasoning upon their\r\nquestion, whether he intended to order the men to fire, was evasive;\r\nand may serve to show Captain Preston's opinion, that however well\r\nbehav'd these gentlemen were, they were no Soldiers.\r\n\r\nI shall now take notice of what the witnesses for the crown testified\r\nconcerning the behavior of the Soldiers, upon their first arrival at\r\nthe custom-house. Mr. Austin saw the party come down; the captain was\r\nwith them; McCauley, one of the prisoners, loaded his gun, push'd at\r\nhim with his bayonet and damn'd him - He did not observe the people\r\npress on - Mr. Bridgham declared, that about a dozen surrounded the\r\nSoldiers and struck their guns with their sticks: But he also said the\r\nSoldiers were loading at the same time - He further added, that he did\r\nnot apprehend himself or the Soldiers in any danger by any thing he\r\nsaw, from whence it may be suppos'd, that as the people struck their\r\nguns only, when they might as easily have have knocked them down,\r\ntheir intention was not to hurt them, but rather to prevent their\r\nloading - Mr. Brewer saw the party come down - told Captain Preston\r\nthat every body was about dispersing; in which he agreed with another\r\nwitness, who was of the opinion that the people would have dispers'd\r\nif the Soldiers had not come down; Mr. Brewer added, that Killroi, one\r\nof the prisoners, struck him with his bayonet before they formed, and\r\nthat he saw no blows and nothing thrown before the firing - Mr. Bailey\r\ntestified, that when the party came down, Carrol one of the prisoners\r\nput his bayonet to his breast. Mr. Wilkinson stood at about two yards\r\ndistance from the Soldiers all the while they were there - He saw no\r\nice nor snow balls thrown; in which he agreed with Mr. Austin - Mr.\r\nFosdick testified, that he was push'd as the party came down - that\r\nafterwards they wounded him in the breast - two different bayonets\r\nwere thrust into his arm - all this while there had been no blows that\r\nhe saw, nor did he know the cause of their firing - Mr. Palmes saw\r\nCapt. Preston at the head of the Soldiers who were drawn up with their\r\nguns breast high and their bayonets fixed; and Preston told him they\r\nwere loaded with powder and ball - I think I have mentioned all the\r\nwitnesses, who testified in court to what they saw upon the first\r\narrival of the party at the customhouse: And by their testimonies the\r\nreader will judge, whether the Soldiers had just provocation to fire\r\nupon the people; or whether they were in danger of their lives or had\r\nany reason to think they were: On the contrary, whether they did not\r\nthemselves first assault the people as they were coming from the main\r\nguard; and afterwards, by levelling their guns loaded with ball in an\r\nexasperating manner at the people; pushing their bayonets at some of\r\nthem, wounding others and threatning all, even before any injury had\r\nbeen offer'd to them.\r\n\r\nI shall conclude what I have to say upon this interesting subject in\r\nmy next. In the mean time let me assure Philanthrop, that I am fully\r\nof his mind, that a true patriot \"will not from private views, or by\r\nany ways or means foment and cherish groundless fears and jealousies\":\r\nBut perhaps we may not be so well agreed in our determination, when\r\nthe fears and jealousies of our fellow citizens are groundless - It is\r\nI believe the general opinion of judicious men, that at present there\r\nare good grounds to apprehend a settled design to enslave and ruin the\r\ncolonies; and that some men of figure and station in America, have\r\nadopted the plan, and would gladly lull the people to sleep, the\r\neasier to put it in execution: But I believe Philanthrop would be far\r\nfrom acknowledging that he is of that opinion. The fears and\r\njealousies of the people are not always groundless: And when they\r\nbecome general, it is not to be presum'd that they are; for the people\r\nin general seldom complain, without some good reason. The inhabitants\r\nof this continent are not to be dup'd \"by an artful use of the words\r\nliberty and slavery, in an application to their passions,\" as\r\nPhilanthrop would have us think they are; like the miserable Italians,\r\nwho are cheated with the names \" Excommunication, Bulls, Crusades,\"\r\n&c. They can distinguish between \"realities and sounds\"; and by a\r\nproper use \"of that reason which Heaven has given them \", they can\r\njudge, as well as their betters, when there is danger of slavery. They\r\nhave as high a regard for George the III. as others have, & yet can\r\nsuppose it possible they may be made slaves, without \"enslaving\r\nthemselves by their own folly and madness\"; They can believe, that men\r\nwho \"are bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh, born and bred among\r\nus,\" may, like Achan, for a wedge of gold, detach themselves from the\r\ncommon interest, and embark in another bottom; in hopes that they,\r\n\"with their wives and children\" will one day stand and see, and enjoy,\r\nand triumph, in the ruins of their country: Such instances there have\r\nbeen frequently in times past; and I dare not say, we have not at\r\npresent, reason enough for \"exclaiming with the roman patriot, 0\r\ntempora, 0 mores \". The true patriot therefore, will enquire\r\ninto the causes of the fears and jealousies of his countrymen; and if\r\nhe finds they are not groundless, he will be far from endeavoring to\r\nallay or stifle them: On the contrary, constrain'd by the Amor Patrae,\r\nand from public views, he will by all proper means in his power foment\r\nand cherish them: He will, as far as he is able, keep the attention of\r\nhis fellow citizens awake to their grievances; and not suffer them to\r\nbe at rest, till the causes of their just complaints are removed. - At\r\nsuch a time Philanthrop's Patriot may be \"very cautious of charging\r\nthe want of ability or integrity to those with whom any of the powers\r\nof government are entrusted\": But the true patriot, will constantly be\r\njealous of those very men: Knowing that power, especially in times of\r\ncorruption, makes men wanton; that it intoxicates the mind; and unless\r\nthose with whom it is entrusted, are carefully watched, such is the\r\nweakness or the perverseness of human nature, they will be apt to\r\ndomineer over the people, instead of governing them, according to the\r\nknown laws of the state, to which alone they have submitted. If he\r\nfinds, upon the best enquiry, the want of ability or integrity; that\r\nis, an ignorance of, or a disposition to depart from, the\r\nconstitution, which is the measure and rule of government &\r\nsubmission, he will point them out, and loudly proclaim them: He will\r\nstir up the people, incessantly to complain of such men, till they are\r\neither reform'd, or remov'd from that sacred trust, which it is\r\ndangerous for them any longer to hold. -Philanthrop may tell us of the\r\nhazard \"of disturbing and inflaming the minds of the multitude whose\r\npassions know no bounds\": A traitor to the constitution alone can\r\ndread this: The multitude I am speaking of, is the body of the people\r\n- no contemptible multitude - for whose sake government is instituted;\r\nor rather, who have themselves erected it, solely for their own good -\r\nto whom even kings and all in subordination to them, are strictly\r\nspeaking, servants and not masters. \"The constitution and its\r\nlaws are the basis of the public tranquility - the firmest support of\r\nthe public authority, and the pledge of the liberty of the citizens:\r\nBut the constitution is a vain Phantom, and the best laws are useless,\r\nif they are not religiously observed. The nation ought then to watch,\r\nand the true patriot will watch very attentively, in order to render\r\nthem equally respected, by those who govern, and the people destin'd\r\nto obey \" - To violate the laws of the state is a capital crime; and\r\nif those guilty of it, are invested with authority, they add to this\r\ncrime, a perfidious abuse of the power with which they are entrusted:\r\n\"The nation therefore, the people, ought to suppress those abuses with\r\ntheir utmost care & vigilance\" - This is the language of a very\r\ncelebrated author, whom I dare say, Philanthrop is well acquainted\r\nwith, and will acknowledge to be an authority.\r\n\r\nPhilanthrop, I think, speaks somewhat unintelligibly, when he tells us\r\nthat the well being and happiness of the whole depends upon\r\nsubordination; as if mankind submitted to government, for the sake of\r\nbeing subordinate: In the state of nature there was subordination: The\r\nweaker was by force made to bow down to the more powerful. This is\r\nstill the unhappy lot of a great part of the world, under government:\r\nSo among the brutal herd, the strongest horns are the strongest laws.\r\nMankind have entered into political societies, rather for the sake of\r\nrestoring equality; the want of which, in the state of nature,\r\nrendered existence uncomfortable and even dangerous. I am not of\r\nlevelling principles: But I am apt to think, that constitution of\r\ncivil government which admits equality in the most extensive degree,\r\nconsistent with the true design of government, is the best; and I am\r\nof this opinion, because I agree with Philanthrop and many others,\r\nthat man is a social animal. Subordination is necessary to promote the\r\npurposes of government; the grand design of which is, that men might\r\nenjoy a greater share of the blessings resulting from that social\r\nnature, and those rational powers, with which indulgent Heaven has\r\nendow'd us, than they could in the state of nature: But there is a\r\ndegree of subordination, which will for ever be abhorrent to the\r\ngenerous mind; when it is extended to the very borders, if not within\r\nthe bounds of slavery: A subordination, which is so far from conducing\r\n\"to the welfare and happiness of the whole\", that it necessarily\r\ninvolves the idea of that worst of all the evils of this life, a\r\ntyranny: An abject servility, which instead of \"being essential\r\nto our existence as a people,\" disgraces the human nature, and sinks\r\nit to that of the most despicable brute.\r\n\r\nI cannot help thinking, that the reader must have observed in\r\nPhilanthrop's last performance, that a foundation is there laid for a\r\ndangerous superstructure: and that from his principles, might easily\r\nbe delineated a plan of despotism, which however uncommon it may be,\r\nfor the laws and constitution of the state to be openly and boldly\r\noppos'd, our enemies have long threatened to establish by violence. If\r\nPhilanthrop upon retrospection shall think so, he will, like a prudent\r\nphysician, administer an antidote for the poison: If not, I hope the\r\nattention of others will be awakened to that excellent maxim, \"no less\r\nessential in politicks than in morals\", principiis obsta. It is\r\nimpolitick to make the first attempt to enslave mankind by force: This\r\nstrikes the imagination, and is alarming: \"Important changes\r\ninsensibly happen: It is against silent & slow attacks that a nation\r\nought to be particularly on its guard.\"\r\n\r\nVINDEX.\r\nJan. 15th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE SIGNED VINDEX.\"\r\n[Boston Gazette, January 28, 1771]\r\n\r\nTo the PRINTERS.\r\n\r\nIn my last, I recollected the testimonies of the witnesses on both\r\nsides, who related in court the behavior of the soldiers and the\r\npeople, on the fatal evening of the fifth of March last. The reader,\r\nif he pleases, will judge; whether the people struck the soldiers\r\nguns, or threw snow balls or any other thing, or offer'd them the\r\nleast violence, from their first turning out till they had march'd to\r\nthe custom-house, abused, threatned, beat and wounded the people,\r\nloaded their guns with powder and ball, levelled them, and waved\r\nthem in an exasperating manner, and gave out that they would fire; for, if\r\nAndrew is to be believed, he testified, that when one of the persons\r\ntalking with the officer, turn'd and said, \"they are going to fire \",\r\nthe people shouted, and said \"they dare not fire \", and then they\r\nbegan to throw snow balls. If all these things were done by the\r\nsoldiers, before the people offer'd them any injury, I would ask, who\r\nmade the first assault? If there was an unlawful assembly, who were\r\nthey? Were the people the unlawful assembly, who were collected\r\ntogether, some from an apprehension of fire in the town, and with the\r\nnecessary preparations, engines and buckets, to have extinguish'd it,\r\nif there had been one; others from the more alarming apprehension,\r\nthat the soldiers had issued from the barracks, as indeed they had\r\ndone, and that agreable to their threatnings many days before, and\r\ntheir correspondent behavior on that very evening, they were\r\nmassacreing the inhabitants? Were they, who bore all that insolent and\r\nirritating language from the soldiers, as they march'd from the main\r\nguard, and before they form'd at the customhouse; who were push'd at,\r\nstruck with bayonets and wounded, to be charg'd with being the\r\naggressors, because they finally, when they saw them bent upon firing\r\nagainst repeated warnings, took such methods as their understanding\r\ndictated to them, in the midst of such a scene, to prevent their\r\n\"committing so rash an act\"? An act, which it was the duty as well as\r\nthe profess'd design of their officer to have prevented; and which, in\r\nthe opinion of some, he might have prevented if he would: And yet we\r\nfind a person of high rank and figure in this province, testifying in\r\ncourt in the case of Capt. Preston, that such was his opinion of the\r\nprudence of this same officer, that he should have chosen him out to\r\nhave commanded upon a like occasion.\r\n\r\nI believe, that in ordinary times, if a banditti of men of violence\r\nhad been seen, with guns loaded and bayonets fix'd, trembling with\r\nrage, and ready to fire upon a multitude in the street, it would have\r\nbeen counted meritorious, in any man or number of men, at all events\r\nto have disarm'd them; and if death had ensued in the attempt, perhaps\r\nit would not have been adjudg'd excuseable homicide or manslaughter. I\r\nam sensible it is said by some, that it was the duty of the soldiers\r\nto maintain their post: It was sworn by a military officer in court,\r\nthat \"the centinel at the custom-house, was station'd and appointed by\r\nthe commanding officer, Lieut. Colonel Dalrymple; that they could not\r\nstir from their post, and it was at their peril if they did\"; and\r\nCapt. Preston in his state of the case says, \"He sent a party to\r\nprotect the centinel\": But this is military language; to be used in\r\ncamps and garrison'd towns, not in free cities; in courts martial, and\r\nnot in courts of common law: It is dangerous to adopt military maxims,\r\nhowever pleasing they may be to some men, and to bring them into use\r\nin civil societies: If the centinel had been in danger, as was\r\npretended, the law of the land, to which the most distinguish'd\r\nofficer in the King's army is subjected, would have protected that\r\ncentinel: Or, if there had indeed been a dangerous mob,\r\nthe law would have suppress'd it; and no soldier should have dared to\r\nhave interfered, as a soldier, without the command of a civil\r\nmagistrate.\r\n\r\nCapt. Preston in his state has said, \"The mob still increas'd, and was\r\nmore outrageous\": And what did he say the mob did after they became\r\nmore outrageous? Why, \"they struck their clubs or bludgeons one\r\nagainst another: and called out, come on you rascals, bloody backs,\r\nlobster scoundrels, fire if you dare, we know you dare not fire, and\r\nmuch more such language\": But surely it will not be said, that all\r\nthis would justify or excuse their firing: This was after the soldiers\r\nhad insulted and wounded the people, and had loaded their guns and\r\nthreatned to fire, as appears by the current evidence; and yet\r\nhitherto, by his own account, we find no violence nor even threat\r\noffer'd to the soldiers; nothing but hard names and daring them to\r\nfire. He adds, \"while I was parleying and endeavoring all in my power\r\nto perswade them to retire peaceably - they advanced to the points of\r\nthe bayonets, struck some of them, and even the muzzels of the\r\npeices\"; which corresponds with the testimonies of some of the\r\nwitnesses in court before mentioned, who said that while they were\r\nloading, the people struck their guns; very probably, however\r\nindiscrete it might be, to prevent their firing. He further says \"they\r\nseem'd to be endeavoring to close in with the soldiers\" : This was not\r\nmention'd by any witness in court, nor does it seem to be likely:\r\nIndeed, I cannot see how Capt. Preston could imagine, that they seem'd\r\nto be endeavoring to close in with the soldiers: He says, \"he was\r\ntalking with some well behaved persons, who had asked him whether he\r\nintended to order the men to fire\": Some of the witnesses mention'd\r\nthe people's pressing in, and more naturally accounted for it, viz,\r\nfrom a curiosity \"to know what was said \". Capt. Preston adds,\r\n\"while I was thus speaking (with the well behaved persons, and in all\r\nlikelihood at the very instant, when Andrew testified it was said,\r\nthey were going to fire) one of the soldiers having received a severe\r\nblow with a stick, stepped a little on one side and instantly fired.\"\r\nUpon this, says Capt. Preston, \"a general attack was made upon the\r\nmen\": So that there was no general attack, according to his account,\r\ntill after the firing; which agrees with Mr. Bridgham and other\r\nunexceptionable witnesses in court, who declared, that \"there was no\r\ndanger to the soldiers from any thing they saw \" -- \" no molestation,\r\nnor any thing which they thought could produce firing\": Indeed, one of\r\nthe witnesses for the prisoners, Mr. Nath. Russell testified, that\r\n\"the soldiers were in a trembling situation, and seemed to apprehend\r\nthemselves in immediate danger of death\"; but being interrogated,\r\nwhether their trembling might not be the effect of rage, he replied,\r\nperhaps it might proceed both from fear and rage. If there had been\r\nsuch a general attack as Capt. Preston mentions, after one of the\r\nsoldiers had actually fired, and the others appear'd to be just ready\r\nto fire (for they all discharg'd their guns in a few minutes\r\nafterwards) it would have been such an appearance as might naturally\r\nhave been expected; and therefore Capt. Preston, who, as he says,\r\n\"followed\" the party for that very purpose, should have taken more\r\neffectual care than he did to have \"prevented so rash an act \" - There\r\nwas time enough for him to have at least prevented the continuance of\r\nthe firing after the first gun was discharg'd, and consequently to\r\nhave saved the lives of some of his Majesty's subjects ; for Mr.\r\nBridgham testified, that there  was half a minute between the first\r\nand the second gun.\r\n\r\nIt seems by the evidence, that Montgomery, one of the prisoners, was\r\nthe first who fired: It is probable that he was the man, whom Captain\r\nPreston mentions, as having received a blow: The witnesses varied in\r\ntheir testimonies concerning this fact: He was struck with a stick,\r\neither flung from behind or otherwise: Some say he was knock'd down;\r\nothers, that he did not fall: Capt. Preston himself said, \"he stepped\r\na little on one side\": Mr. Palmes, who gave, I think, the clearest\r\naccount of this matter, declared, that he saw Montgomery struck; he\r\nstepped or sallied back, he could not say which - he did not fall; he\r\nwas sure he was not knock'd down before he fired; he could not be, &\r\nhe not see it, for his hand was laid familiarly on Capt. Preston's\r\nshoulder, and the soldier stood close to the Captain; he added, that\r\nhe himself knock'd Montgomery down, after they had all fired; and the\r\nreason was, that because even then, he was going to prick him with his\r\nbayonet. It seems, the rage of passion in the breast of this soldier,\r\nlike that in Killroi's, had not abated, after discharging his piece\r\nupon the people: His thirst was not even then asswaged:' Upon his\r\nattempt, after all the firing, and while numbers were dead on the spot\r\nbefore him, to stab Mr. Palmes, he struck with his stick, and knock'd\r\nhis gun out of his hand; and then he struck the first man he could,\r\nwhich happened to be Preston: A circumstance related by Preston\r\nhimself, with this difference; he says he received the blow, as he\r\nturned to the man who fired, and asked him why he fired without\r\norders; Mr. Palmes said, it was after all the guns were fired: So that\r\nif Mr. Palmes was not mistaken, Capt. Preston did not put that\r\nnecessary question, till after all the firing was over, tho' there was\r\nhalf a minute's distance between the first and second gun! Mr. Palmes\r\nspake upon oath in court; Capt. Preston did not: Which of them was the\r\nmore disinterested person, the reader will judge. Mr. Palmes mentioned\r\na further struggle between him and Montgomery; and the soldier, after\r\nthe third attempt to stab him, in missing him fell to the ground, and\r\nhe escaped with his life. - Mr. Danbrook saw Montgomery fire, and two\r\npersons fall - Mr. Bass also saw the same soldier fire; was sure he\r\ndid not fall before he fired; he stood where he must have seen it; he\r\nthought he fell afterwards, which co-operates with Mr. Palmes's\r\ntestimony. - Mr. Burdick went up to one of the soldiers, whom he took\r\nto be the bald man (pointing at Montgomery); asked him whether he\r\nintended to fire; he answered, yes by the eternal God! A soldier\r\npush'd his bayonet at him, upon which he struck at him a violent blow\r\nand hit the cock of his gun; he saw but one thing thrown, and that was\r\na short stick ; he heard a ratling, & took it to be the knocking of\r\nthe soldiers guns together; for the ground was slippery, and they were\r\ncontinually pushing at the people; after the firing, while the people\r\nwere taking up the dead, the soldiers began to present and cock their\r\nguns, and then the officer said don't fire any more. - Andrew\r\ndeclared, that the soldiers were pushing with their bayonets\r\nall the time he was there; and that the people (being advis'd so to do\r\nbefore any gun was discharged) seemed to be turning away to leave the\r\nsoldiers : he gives a very minute account of three or four person's\r\ncoming round Jackson's corner, with a stout man at their head - his\r\nthrowing himself in and making a stroke at the officer - their paying\r\nupon each others heads - and the soldiers paying upon the heads of the\r\npeople too; and concludes this part of his narrative, with the\r\nsoldiers firing: It seems however, to be the account of the contest\r\nbetween Mr. Palmes and Montgomery, after all the firing was over, as\r\nrelated by Mr. Palmes; and wro't up and embellished, in a manner in\r\nwhich Andrew was said to be capable of doing, and sometimes to have\r\ndone upon occasions of mirth, and to divert company.\r\n\r\nIt appears from what has been said, that after the Soldiers had\r\nrepeatedly put the lives of individuals in danger, by pushing them\r\nwith their bayonets and stabbing them; and had loaded their guns and\r\nthreatned to fire upon the multitude indiscriminately, and the people\r\nhad reason to apprehend they were just about to put their threats into\r\nexecution, by a stick thrown as is most probable, Montgomery received\r\na blow: That this was tho't by him sufficient provocation to fire upon\r\nthe people, by which one of the witnesses said, two persons were\r\nkilled; that Capt. Preston, at so alarming a juncture took no method\r\nto prevent the rest from firing, if what was testified, in court is to\r\nbe credited; or, if his own account must be rely'd upon, he exerted no\r\nauthority over his men, but used expostulations only: \"I asked him\r\n(who first fired and as soon as he had fired) why he fired without\r\norder\"; very faintly said indeed, by a gentleman in command, and who\r\nhad followed the party to \"prevent their committing a rash act\": What\r\nensued was enough to show, either that he had no command over the men,\r\nor that they did not apprehend he was much adverse to their firing;\r\nfor they soon after fired, and as we are told, without orders - That\r\nafter they had all fired, Montgomery made three attempts to stab Mr.\r\nPalmes, who defended himself, and with difficulty escaped with his\r\nlife - That the Soldiers had even at that time, again loaded their\r\nguns and were then, ready to repeat the bloody \"action\", and fire upon\r\nthe people as they were taking care of the dead! Then, for the first\r\ntime, we hear of a positive order from Capt. Preston \"don't fire\r\nanymore\": His order before should have been, \"don't fire by any means\r\n\", or some other order equivalent to the last, and more regular\r\nperhaps than either. - It further appeared by the evidence in court,\r\nthat when the first gun was fired, the people began to disperse: Mr.\r\nBridgham, whose testimony I presume, will not be disputed, said \"they\r\nretired after the first gun\": Was it not then \"such malignity as might\r\nhardly have been expected from barbarians,\" to continue firing!\r\nAstonishing as it may be to humanity, this they did: And being\r\nresolved to do further execution, Mr. Williams, a person of known\r\ncredit, testified, that \"they waved their guns at the people as\r\nthey ran\": And what, if possible, is still more barbarous, the last\r\nman that fired, as Mr. Bridgham testified, \"level'd his gun at a boy,\r\nand mov'd it along, with the motion of the lad\"; which testimony, if\r\nit needs it, is confirmed by that of Mr. Helyer: Both agreed that the\r\nlad was not wounded.\r\n\r\n\"I shall make no further comments; there needs none\": I will just say,\r\nthat however safely Philanthrop may speak, when he tells us, that \"no\r\nindividual can have a right, openly to complain or murmur\"; if the\r\ntimes at present were even such, as not to allow one openly to declare\r\nthe utmost detestation of such slavish doctrine, I would still venture\r\nto declare my opinion to all the world, that no individual is bound,\r\nnor is it in the power of the tyrants of the earth to bind him, to\r\nacquiesce in any decision, that upon the best enquiry, he cannot in\r\nhis conscience approve of. I pretend not to judge the hearts of men:\r\nThe \"temptations that some men could be under, to act otherwise than\r\nconformably to the sentiments of their own hearts\" are obvious: But I\r\nwould ask Philanthrop, whether, if a man should openly say, that those\r\ntemptations have had their genuine effects, he would not expose\r\nhimself to have a bill of information filed against him, by the\r\nattorney general, and to be dealt with in a summary way.\r\n\r\nAs it was published to the world by Mr. Draper, that the witnesses in\r\nthe trial of the custom-house officers, were not credited, I may\r\npossibly hereafter, when I shall be more at leisure, make that the\r\nsubject of a free enquiry.\r\n\r\nVINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES LUCAS.1\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library; the text is in W.

The Generality are necessarily engagd in Application to\r\nprivate Business for the Support of their own families and when at a\r\nlucky Season the publick are awakened to a Sense of Danger, & a manly\r\nresentment is enkindled, it is difficult, for so many separate\r\nCommunities as there are in all the Colonies, to agree in one\r\nconsistent plan of Opposition while those who are the appointed\r\nInstruments of Oppression, have all the Means put into their hands, of\r\napplying to the passions of Men & availing themselves of the\r\nNecessities of some, the Vanity of others & the timidity of all.\r\n\r\nI have long thought that a Design has been on foot to render\r\nineffectual the Democratical part of this Government, even before the\r\nprovince was cursd with the Appointment of Bernard, and so unguarded\r\nhave the people been in former times, so careless in the Choice of\r\ntheir representatives as to send too many who either through Ignorance\r\nor Wickedness have favord that Design. Of late the lower house of\r\nAssembly have been more sensible of this Danger & supported in some\r\nMeasure their own Weight, which has alarmd the Conspirators and been\r\nin my opinion the true Source of Bernards Complaint against them as\r\nhaving set up a faction against the Kings Authority. The 4 Judges of\r\nthe Supreme Court, the Secretary & the Kings Attourny who had been\r\nCouncellors were left out at the annual Election in 1766; this gave\r\ngreat offence to the Govr, and was followd with two Speeches to both\r\nHouses perhaps as infamous & irritating as ever came from a Stuart to\r\nthe English parliamt.2 Happy indeed it was for the Province that such\r\na Man was at the Head of it, for it occasiond such a Jealousy &\r\nWatchfulness in the people as prevented their immediate & total Ruin.\r\n\r\nThe plan however is still carried on tho in a Manner some what\r\ndifferent; and that is by making the Governor altogether independent\r\nof the People for his Support; this is depriving the House of\r\nRepresentatives of the only Check they have upon him & must\r\nconsequently render them the Objects of the Contempt of a Corrupt\r\nAdministration. Thus the peoples Money being first taken from them\r\nwithout their Consent, is appropriated for the Maintenance of a\r\nGovernor at the Discretion of one in the Kingdom of Great Britain upon\r\nwhom he absolutely depends for his Support. If this be not a Tyranny I\r\nam at a Loss to conceive what a Tyranny is. The House of\r\nRepresentatives did a few days since, grant the Govr the usual Sum for\r\nhis Support and it is expected that this Matter will be made certain\r\nupon his refusal of it. The Govr of New York was explicit at the late\r\nSession of their Assembly, upon the like Occasion: But I confess I\r\nshould not be surprisd if our good Govr, should accept the Grant &\r\ndiscount it out of what he is to receive out of the Kings Chest;\r\nthinking it will be conceivd by the Minister as highly meritorious in\r\nhim, in thus artfully concealing his Independency (for the\r\nApprehension of it is alarming to the people) & saving 1000 Pounds\r\nsterling of the revenue at the same time.\r\n\r\nWhile the Representative Body of the people is thus renderd a mere\r\nName, it is . . . considerd that the other Branch of the Legislative\r\ntho annually elective, is at the same time subject to the Governors\r\nNegative: A Consideration which I doubt not has its full Weight in the\r\nminds of some of them at least, whenever any Matter comes before them\r\nwhich they can possibly think will affect the Measures of\r\nAdministration. You will easily conjecture how far this may tend to\r\nannihilate that Branch or produce Effects more fatal.\r\n\r\nIt seems then that we are in effect to be under the absolute Governm'\r\nof one Man - ostensively the Governor of the province but in Reality\r\nsome other person residing in Great Britain, whose Instructions the\r\nGovr must punctually observe upon pain of forfeiting his place. So\r\nthat any little advantage that might now & then arise from his\r\nhappening to form Connections with wise Men in the province are\r\ntotally lost. As Matters are now circumstancd he must associate with\r\nPensioners, Commissioners of the Customs Officers of the Army & Navy,\r\nTools Sycophants &c who together with him are to make such\r\nrepresentations as to them shall seem meet, & joyntly if Occasion\r\nshall require it, execute such Orders as they shall from time to time\r\nreceive. Such is to be the happy Government of free British Subjects\r\nin America. I will however do Govr Hutchinson the Justice to say that\r\ntho he may 3 . . yet he has a very natural Connection with some of the\r\nprincipal Gentlemen Inhabitants of the province for his Excellencys\r\nown Brother is a Justice of the Superior Court, & also a Judge of the\r\nprobate of Wills & he has also a Brother by marriage upon the same\r\nsuperior Bench. Moreover the Lt Govr is his Brother by marriage who\r\nhas an own Brother & a Brother by marriage who are justices of the\r\nSuperior Court. As these Gentlemen are Natives of the province it is\r\nhoped the Channells of Justice will remain unpolluted notwithstanding\r\nhis Excellencys other Connections.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 On January 10, 1771, Lee wrote to Adams: Our friend Mr. Sayre has\r\ndone me the favour of communicating to me your very obliging\r\ninvitation to a correspondence.\"-R.

Such an Act of Hostility, we conceive\r\ncould not but be followd with the most spirited Resolution on the part\r\nof the British Administration, to obtain a Satisfaction fully adequate\r\nto the Insult offerd to his Majesty, & the Injuries his Subjects there\r\nhave sustaind. Your Excellency tells us that it is probable\r\nSatisfaction may have been made; for this Hostile act of the\r\nSpaniards: If it is so, the publick Tranquility of his Majestys\r\nDominions so far as it has been disturbd, by this unwarrantable\r\nProceeding, is again restored; and therefore it seems to us reasonable\r\nto suppose, that the proposd Plan of Augmentation of Troops on the\r\nBritish Establishment is already receded from ; which renders any\r\nConsideration upon that Subject on our part unnecessary.\r\n\r\nWe owe our Gratitude to his Majesty for his repeated Assurances\r\nexpressd to your Excellency by his Secretary of State, that the\r\nSecurity of his Dominions in America, will be a principal Object of\r\nhis most gracious Care & Attention. This Province has frequently in\r\ntimes past expended much Blood & Treasure for the Enlargement as well\r\nas the Support of those Dominions: And when our natural &\r\nconstitutional Rights & Liberties, without which no Blessing can be\r\nsecure to us, shall be fully restord & establishd upon a firm\r\nFoundation, as we shall then have the same Reasons and Motives\r\ntherefor as heretofore, we shall not fail to continue those Exertions\r\nwith the utmost Chearfulness & to the Extent of our Ability.\r\n\r\nAs your Excellency has no particular interior Business of the Province\r\nto lay before us, it would have given us no uneasiness, if an End had\r\nbeen put to the present Assembly, rather than to have been again\r\ncalled to this Place: And we are unwilling to admit the Beliefe, that\r\nwhen the Season for calling a new Assembly agreable to the Charter\r\nshall arrive, your Excellency will continue an Indignity, & a\r\nGrievance so flagrant & so repeatedly remonstrated by both Houses as\r\nthe Deforcement of the General Assembly of its ancient & Rightful\r\nSeat.1\r\n\r\nYour Excellency is pleasd to acquaint us in Form, that you have\r\nreceivd his Majestys Commission appointing you Captain General &\r\nCommander in Chiefe in and over the Province. Your having had your\r\nBirth & Education in this Province, and sustaind the highest Honors\r\nwhich your Fellow Subjects could bestow, cannot fail to be the\r\nstrongest Motives with your Excellency to employ those Powers which\r\nyou are now vested with, for his Majestys real Service & the best\r\nInterest of this People. The Duties of the Governor & Governed are\r\nreciprocal: And by our happy Constitution their Dependence is mutual:\r\nNothing can more effectually produce & establish that Order and\r\nTranquility in the Province so often disturbd under the late\r\nunfortunate Administration: Nothing will tend more to conciliate the\r\nAffections of this People, & ensure to your Excellency those Aids\r\nwhich you will constantly stand in Need of from their Representatives,\r\nthan, as a wise and faithful Administrator to make Use of the publick\r\nPower, with a View only to the publick Welfare: And while your Excy\r\nshall religiously regard the Constitution of this Province; while you\r\nshall maintain its fundamental Laws, so necessary to secure the\r\npublick Tranquility, you may be assured, that his Majestys faithful\r\nCommons of this Province, will never be wanting in their utmost\r\nExertions to support you in all such measures, as shall be calculated\r\nfor the publick Good, & to render your Administration prosperous &\r\nhappy.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 On April 3 the House had appointed a committee, and on April 4 two\r\ncommittees, in connection with the requests to the Governor to remove\r\nthe General Court to Boston. Adams was a member of each of these\r\ncommittees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF MASSACHUSETTS TO THE GOVERNOR.1\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library; a text, with modifications,\r\nis in Massachusetts State Papers, p. 298; a text is also in Journal of\r\nthe House of Representatives, 1770-1771, p. 246.]\r\n\r\nIn the House of Representatives April 25 1771\r\n\r\nOrderd that Mr Saml Adams Brig Ruggles Mr Hersy Coll Bowers & Mr\r\nGodfrey be a Committee to wait on his Excellency with the following\r\nmessage.\r\n\r\nMay it please your Excellency.\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives after Enquiry of the Secretary cannot be\r\nmade certain whether you have yet given your Assent to two Bills which\r\nwere laid before your Excellency early in this Session: The one for\r\ngranting the Sum of five hundred and Six pounds for your Services when\r\nLieutenant Governor and Commander in Chiefe; and the other for\r\ngranting the usual Sum of Thirteen hundred Pounds to enable your\r\nExcellency, as Governor, to carry on the Affairs of this Province.\r\n\r\nAnd as your Excellency was not pleasd to give your Assent to another\r\nBill passd in the last Session of this Assembly, for granting the Sum\r\nof three hundred & twenty five pounds for your Services, when in the\r\nChair, as Lieutenant Governor, the House are apprehensive that you are\r\nunder some Restraint; and they cannot account for it upon any other\r\nPrinciple, but your having Provision for your Support, in some new and\r\nunprecedented manner. If the Apprehensions of the House are not\r\ngroundless, they are sollicitous to be made certain of it, before an\r\nEnd is put to the present Session;2 and think it their Duty to pray\r\nyour Excellency to inform them, whether any provision is made for your\r\nSupport, as Governor of this Province, independent of his Majestys\r\nCommons in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 On April 24, Adams moved that the House send a message to the\r\nGovernor asking whether provision had been made for his support\r\nindependently of the legislature. The motion was carried, and Adams\r\nwas named as the first member of the committee to prepare such a\r\nmessage. On April 25, he was named as the first of a committee to\r\npresent the message to the Governor.\r\n2 The General Court was dissolved on April 26.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE SIGNED \"CANDIDUS.\"\r\n\r\n[Boston Gazette, June 10, 1771.]\r\n\r\nMessieurs EDES & GILL,\r\n\r\nBENEVOLUS, in Mr. Draper's Gazette seems to have no doubts in his\r\nmind, but that \"a general air of satisfaction arising from the\r\naccounts given in the last Monday's papers of the present state of our\r\npublick affairs will shew itself universally thro' the province.\" I\r\nhave no inclination to disturb the sweet repose of this placid\r\ngentleman; but I must confess I see no cause for such a general air of\r\nsatisfaction from those accounts, and I will venture to add, that\r\nthere is no appearance of it in this town - Does Benevolus think it\r\npossible for the good people of this province to be satisfied, when\r\nthey are told by the Governor, as appears by the last Monday's papers,\r\nthat he is restrained from holding the court in its antient, usual and\r\nmost convenient place without his Majesty's express leave? Does not\r\nthe charter say that the Governor shall have the power of acting in\r\nthis matter \"as he shall judge necessary\"?\r\n\r\nIs it not of great importance to the welfare of the province that the\r\nGovernor should be vested with such a power, and that he should\r\nexercise it without restraint? While he is, or thinks himself\r\nfetter'd, by an absolute instruction to hold the assembly out of the\r\ntown of Boston, to the inconvenience of the members. and the injury of\r\nthe people, as the present House of Representatives express it, can he\r\nbe said to have the free exercise of all the powers vested in him by\r\nthe charter, which is our social compact? Will it yield such a general\r\nsatisfaction to the people as Benevolus expects, to see their Governor\r\nthus embarrass'd in his administration, and to hear him expressly\r\ndeclaring, that he must ask leave, and be determin'd by the judgment\r\nof another in the matter in which it is his indispensible duty to act\r\nwith freedom, and by the determination of his own judgment. - Is not\r\nthis power devolv'd upon him by the constitution  of the province for\r\nthe good of the people? Is it not a beneficiary grant, and therefore a\r\nright of the people? And if instructions may controul him in the\r\nexercise of one charter right, may they not controul in the exercise\r\nof any or every one? And yet Benevolus would fain have it thought that\r\nthere is a general satisfaction in the town of Boston arising from\r\nthis account, and doubts not but it will run thro' the province. Does\r\nnot the present House of Representatives in their Remonstrance to the\r\nGovernor against the holding the assembly at Cambridge, instead of\r\n\"departing from the principles\" as Benevolus would insinuate, adopt\r\nthe remonstrances of the two houses of the last year as founded upon\r\njust principles? Do they not tell his Excellency that the holding the\r\nassembly at Cambridge \"was consider'd as a GRIEVANCE by the people in\r\ngeneral in the province; and that while it is continued it will have a\r\ntendency to prevent a restoration of that harmony, between the several\r\nbranches of the general assembly, which is so earnestly to be desired\r\nby all good men\"? And is it so pleasant a story to be told to the\r\npeople of the province, that the Governor either cannot, or will not,\r\nremove a Grievance of so fatal a tendency, though expressly vested by\r\nthe charter with the power of doing it if he pleases, without asking\r\nleave to do it? How then can Benevolus possibly entertain the least\r\nhopes that a general air of satisfaction will run thro' the province?\r\nIs not this Instruction a novelty? Was ever a Governor before thus\r\nrestrain'd? And is it not a mortifying circumstance that a gentleman\r\nfrom whom the clergy of the province, (I mean the goodly number of\r\nSEVENTEEN out of near four hundred in the province, full seven eighths\r\nof whom never heard that an address was intended) have express'd the\r\nmost sanguine expectations as being born and educated among us, and\r\nwho we are told accepted the government with great reluctance, should\r\nsubmit to be shackled with an instruction so grievous to the people\r\nwhile it is obey'd: And if HE is as resolv'd as any other Governor\r\nwould be, to make Instructions the rule of his governing, and give\r\nthem the force of laws in this province, as he certainly appears to\r\nbe, what \"distinguishing mark of favor\" is it, or what satisfaction\r\ncan it afford the people in general, that \"a native of the province is\r\nappointed to preside over it\"? - Surely Benevolus must either be\r\ntotally inadvertent to the accounts of the state of our publick\r\naffairs as given to us in the last Mondays papers, or he must have\r\naltogether confided in the accounts of a confused writer in the\r\nEvening-Post, who in the old stile of the hackney'd writers in\r\nBernard's administration, tells us that FACTION is now at an end; and\r\nwith an awkward air of gravity insinuates, that the people, after\r\nhaving nobly struggled for their freedom, are, under the benign\r\ninfluence of the present administration, \"returning to their right\r\nsenses \". A firm and manly opposition to the attempts that have\r\nbeen made, and are still making, to enslave and ruin this continent,\r\nhas always been branded by writers of this stamp, with the name of a\r\nFACTION. Governor Bernard used to tell his Lordship, that it was an\r\n\"expiring faction\"; with as little reason it is now said to have given\r\nup the ghost: Gladly would some, even of the Clergy, persuade this\r\npeople to be at ease; and for the sake of peace under the\r\nadministration of \"a son of the province\", to acquiesce in\r\nunconstitutional revenue acts, arbitrary ministerial mandates, and\r\nabsolute despotic independent governors, &c. &c. But the time is not\r\nyet come; and I am satisfied that, notwithstanding the address of a\r\nfew who took the opportunity to carry it through, while only the small\r\nnumber of twenty-four were present, there is in that venerable order a\r\ngreat majority, who will not go up to the house of Rimmon, or bow the\r\nknee to Baal.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANDIDUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE SIGNED \"CANDIDUS.\"\r\n\r\n[Boston Gazette, June 17, 1771.]\r\n\r\nMessieurs EDES & GILL,\r\n\r\nIt is not very material whether the Address of the Convention of the\r\nClergy, as it is called by the Layman, in Mr. Draper's last Paper, was\r\nthe Act of seventeen or twenty three Gentlemen, or whether there were\r\nonly twenty-four or thirty present, when the Vote was procured. - Be\r\nit as it may, it is a Question, why this Matter was bro't on and\r\nfinished so early, and when so small a Number as thirty, if so many,\r\nwere present. - It is said that after the Address was Voted, the\r\nNumber increased to Sixty; and upon a Proposal to reconsider the Vote,\r\n\"not above Ten of that Number voted for such Reconsideration.\"\r\nAllowing this to be the Case, it appears, that not more than one in\r\nseven of the Congregational Clergy of this Province were at the\r\nMeeting, and in all Probability seven-eighths of that Denomination\r\nnever heard that an Address was intended; for I am told, that upon a\r\nmoderate Computation, their Number in the Province is at least upwards\r\nof Four-Hundred. I should be glad therefore, if the Reverend Doctor\r\nwho presided at the Meeting, would inform us, with what Propriety the\r\nWorld is told, that this was \"the Address of the Congregational\r\nMinisters of the Province.\"\r\n\r\nFor my own Part, I pay very little Regard to Addresses to Great Men:\r\nWhenever they appear to be but the Breath of Flattery, they must be\r\noffensive to the Ears of any Man who has the Feelings of Truth and\r\nSincerity in his own Breast. -There is no Question but the Clergy have\r\na Right to address whom they please; and it is not strange to find\r\nsome of them ready to make their Compliments to a Governor - It is in\r\nCourse: But of all Men, we are to expect from them, even upon such\r\nOccasions, Examples of that Simplicity and godly Sincerity, which we\r\nso often hear them inculcate from the Pulpit - I do not pretend to\r\ncharge them with a Failure in this Instance: But I cannot help\r\nthinking, that rather more of those excellent Christian Graces would\r\nhave appeared in these Reverend Addressers, if they had ascertained\r\nthe Number present. This might have prevented a Mistake in many of the\r\ndistant Readers, who may possibly conceive that \"so kind, so\r\naffectionate an Address,\" contained the declared Sentiments of a\r\nMajority at least of the \"respectable and venerable\" Body of the\r\nClergy of the Province; which cannot be true, if in Fact not more than\r\na seventh Part of them knew any Thing about it - I am with due\r\nVeneration for \"the Congregational Ministers of the Province.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCANDIDUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\r\nTO BENJAMIN FRANKLIN.1\r\n\r\n[Boston Gazette, July 29, 1771; a text from the Bowdoin MS. is in\r\nProceedings of Massachusetts Historical Society, Ser. I., vol. viii.,\r\npp. 468-473.]\r\n\r\nPROVINCE OF MASSACHUSETTS BAY,\r\n\r\nJune 29, 1771.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 5th of February2 has been laid before the House:\r\nThe contents are important and claim our fixed attention.\r\n\r\nWe cannot think the doctrine of the right of Parliament to tax us is\r\ngiven up, while an act remains in force for that purpose, and is daily\r\nput in execution; and the longer it remains the more danger there is\r\nof the people's becoming so accustomed to arbitrary and\r\nunconstitutional taxes, as to pay them without discontent; and then,\r\nas you justly observe, no Minister will ever think of taking them off,\r\nbut will rather be encouraged to add others. - If ever the provincial\r\nassemblies should be voluntarily silent, on the Parliament's taking\r\nupon themselves a power thus to violate our constitutional and Charter\r\nRights, it might be considered as an approbation of it, or at least a\r\ntacit consent, that such a power should be exercised at any future\r\ntime. It is therefore our duty to declare our Rights and our\r\ndetermined Resolution at all times to maintain them: The time we know\r\nwill come, when they must be acknowledged, established and secured to\r\nus and our posterity.\r\n\r\nWe severely feel the effects, not of a revenue raised, but a tribute\r\nextorted, without our free consent or controul. Pensioners and\r\nPlacemen are daily multiplying; and fleets and standing armies posted\r\nin North America, for no other apparent or real purpose, than to\r\nprotect the exactors and collectors of the tribute; for which they are\r\nto be maintained, & many of them in pomp & pride to triumph over and\r\ninsult an injured people, and suppress if possible, even their\r\nmurmurs. And there is reason to expect, that the continual increase of\r\ntheir numbers will lead to a proportionable increase of a tribute to\r\nsupport them. What would be the consequence? Either on the one hand,\r\nan abject slavery in the people, which is ever to be deprecated; or, a\r\ndetermined resolution, openly to assert and maintain their rights,\r\nliberties and privileges. The effects of such a resolution may for\r\nsome time be retarded by flattering hopes and prospects; and while it\r\nis the duty of all persons of influence here to inculcate the\r\nsentiments of moderation, it will in our opinion, be equally the\r\nwisdom of the British administration, to consider the danger of\r\nforcing a free people by oppressive measures into a state of\r\ndesperation. We have reason to believe that the American Colonies,\r\nhowever they may have disagreed among themselves in one mode of\r\nopposition to arbitrary measures, are still united in the main\r\nprinciples of constitutional & natural liberty; and that they will not\r\ngive up one single point in contest of any importance, tho' they may\r\ntake no violent measures to obtain them. - The taxing their property\r\nwithout their consent, and thus appropriating it to the purposes of\r\ntheir slavery and destruction, is justly considered, as contrary to\r\nand subversive of their original social compact, and their intention\r\nin uniting under it: They cannot therefore readily think themselves\r\nobliged to renounce those forms of government, to which alone for the\r\nadvantages imply'd or resulting, they were willing to submit. We are\r\nsensible, as you observe, that the design of our enemies in England,\r\nas well as those who reside here, is to render us odious as well as\r\ncontemptible, and to prevent all concern for us in the friends of\r\nliberty in England; and perhaps to detach our Sister Colonies from us,\r\nand prevent their aid and influence in our behalf, when the projects\r\nof oppressing us further and depriving us of our Rights by various\r\nviolent measures, should be carried into execution. In this however,\r\nwe flatter ourselves they have failed: But should all the other\r\nColonies become weary of their liberties, after the example of the\r\nHebrews, this Province we trust, will never submit to the authority of\r\nan absolute government.\r\n\r\nWe are now led to take notice of another fatal consequence, which we\r\nare under strong apprehensions will follow from these parliamentary\r\nrevenue laws; and that is, the making the governors of the colonies,\r\nand other officers, independent of the people for their support. You\r\ntell us there is no doubt of such intention, and that it will be\r\npersisted in, if the American revenue is found sufficient. We are the\r\nmore inclin'd to believe it, not only because the governor of the\r\nprovince of New-York has openly declared it with regard to himself, to\r\nthe assembly there; but because the present governor of this province\r\nhas repeatedly refused to accept of the usual grant for his support,\r\ntho' he has not been so explicit as to assign a reason for it. The\r\ncharter of this province recognizes the natural Right of all men to\r\ndispose of their property: And the governor here, like all other\r\ngovernors, kings and potentates, is to be supported by the free grants\r\nof the Representatives of the people. Every one sees the necessity of\r\nthis to preserve the balance of power and the freedom of any state: A\r\npower without a check, is subversive of all freedom: If therefore the\r\ngovernor, who is appointed by the crown, shall be totally independent\r\nof the free grants of the people for his support, where is the check\r\nupon his power? He becomes absolute and may act as he pleases: He may\r\nmake use of his power, not for the good of those who are under it, but\r\nfor his own private separate advantage, or any other purpose to which\r\nhe may be inclined, or instructed by him upon whom alone he depends.\r\nSuch an independency threatens the very being of a free constitution;\r\nand if it takes effect, will produce and firmly establish a tyranny\r\nupon its ruin. The act of parliament of the 7 Geo. 3.3 intitled, \"An\r\nact for granting certain duties in the Colonies, &c.\" declares That it\r\nis expedient that a revenue should be raised in his Majesty's\r\ndominions in America, for making more certain and adequate provision\r\nfor the defraying the charge of the administration of justice, and the\r\nsupport of civil government in such colonies where it shall be found\r\nnecessary; and, towards further defreying the expences of defending,\r\nprotecting and securing the said dominions. - These are the very\r\npurposes for which this government by the Charter is empowered to\r\ngrant taxes: So that by the act aforementioned, the Charter is in\r\neffect made void. Agreeable to the design of that act, the governor it\r\nseems is first to be made independent; and in pursuance of the plan of\r\ndespotism, the judges of the land, and all other important civil\r\nofficers, successively: Next follows an independent military power, to\r\ncompleat the ruin of our civil liberties. - Let us then consider the\r\npower the Governor already has, and his Majesty's negative on all our\r\nacts, and judge whether the purposes of tyranny will not be amply\r\nanswered! Can it be expected that any law will pass here, but such\r\nas will promote the favourite design? And the laws already made, as\r\nthey will be executed by officers altogether dependent on the crown,\r\nwill undoubtedly be perverted to the worst purposes. The governor of\r\nthe province, and the principal fortress in it, are probably already\r\nthus supported. These are the first fruits of the system: If the rest\r\nshould follow, it would be only in a greater degree, a violation of\r\nour essential, natural rights. For what purpose then will it be to\r\npreserve the old forms without the substance? In such a state, and\r\nwith such prospects, can Britain expect anything but a gloomy\r\ndiscontent in the Colonies? Let our fellow-subjects there recollect,\r\nwhat would have been their fate long ago, if their ancestors had\r\nsubmitted to the unreasonable and uncharitable usurpations, exactions\r\nand impositions of the See of Rome, in the reign of Henry the VIII.\r\nSoon would they have sunk into a state of abject slavery to that\r\nhaughty power, which exalteth itself above all that is called God: But\r\nthey had the true spirit of liberty, and by exerting it, they saved\r\nthemselves and their posterity; The act of parliament passed in the\r\n25th of that reign,4 is so much to our present purpose, that we cannot\r\nomit transcribing a part of it, and refer you to the statute at large.\r\nIn the preamble it is declared, that \"the realm of England hath been\r\nand is free from subjection to any man's law but only to such as have\r\nbeen devised, made and ordained within the realm for the wealth of the\r\nsame.\" And further, \"it standeth therefore with natural equity and\r\ngood reason, that in every such law humane made within this realm by\r\nthe said sufferance, consents and customs, your Royal Majesty and your\r\nLords spiritual and temporal and Commons representing the whole state\r\nof your realm in this your Majesty's high court of parliament, hath\r\nfull power and authority, not only to dispense, but also to authorize\r\nsome elect person or persons to be sent to dispense with those and all\r\nother humane laws in this your realm, and with every one of them, as\r\nthe quality of the persons and matter may require. And also the said\r\nlaws and every one of them to abrogate, annul, amplify or diminish, as\r\nit shall seem to your Majesty and the Nobles and Commons of your realm\r\npresent in parliament meet and convenient for the wealth of your\r\nrealm. And because that it is now in these days present seen, that the\r\nstate, dignity and superiority, reputation and authority of the said\r\nimperial crown of this realm, by the long sufferance of the said\r\nunreasonable and uncharitable usurpation and exaction is much and sore\r\ndecayed, and the people of this realm thereby much impoverished.\" It\r\nis then enacted, that \"no person or persons of the realm, or of any\r\nother his Majesty's dominions, shall from henceforth pay any pensions,\r\ncenses, portions, peter pence, or any other impositions to the use of\r\nthe said Bishop of the See of Rome; but that all such pensions, &c.\r\nwhich the said Bishop or Pope hath heretofore taken - shall clearly\r\nsurcease, and never more be levied or paid to any person or persons in\r\nany manner or wise.\" - Nothing short of the slavery and ruin of the\r\nnation would have been the consequence of their submitting to those\r\nexactions: And the same will be the fate of America, if the present\r\nrevenue laws remain, and the natural effect of them, the making\r\ngovernors independent, takes place.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore with entire approbation that we observe your purpose\r\nfreely to declare our Rights, and to remonstrate against the least\r\ninfringement of them. The capital complaint of all North-America, hath\r\nbeen, is now and will be until relieved, a subjugation to as arbitrary\r\na tribute as ever the Romans laid upon the Jews, or their other\r\ncolonies: The repealing these duties in part is not considered by this\r\nhouse as a renunciation of the measure: It has rather the appearance\r\nof a design to sooth us into security in the midst of danger: Any\r\nspecies of tribute unrepealed, will stand as a precedent, to be made\r\nuse of hereafter as circumstances and opportunity may admit: If the\r\nColonies acquiesce in a single instance, it will in effect be yielding\r\nup the whole matter and controversy. We therefore desire it may be\r\nuniversally understood, that altho' the tribute is paid, it is not\r\npaid freely: It is extorted and torn from us against our will: We bear\r\nthe insult and the injury for the present, grievous as it is, with\r\ngreat impatience; hoping that the wisdom and prudence of the nation\r\nwill at length dictate measures consistent with natural justice and\r\nequity: For what shall happen in future, We are not answerable: Your\r\nobservation is just, that it was certainly as bad policy, when they\r\nattempted to heal our differences, by repealing part of the duties\r\nonly, as it is bad Surgery to leave splinters in a wound which must\r\nprevent its healing, or in time occasion it to open afresh.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine, that no agent ought to be received or attended to by\r\ngovernment, who is not appointed by an act of the general court, to\r\nwhich the governor has given his assent, if established, must be\r\nattended with very ill consequences; for, besides the just remarks you\r\nmade upon it, if whatever is to be transacted between the assemblies\r\nof the Colonies and the government, is to be done by agents appointed\r\nby and under the direction of the three branches, it will be utterly\r\nimpracticable for an assembly ever to lay before the Sovereign their\r\ncomplaints of grievances occasioned by the corrupt and arbitrary\r\nadministration of a governor. This doctrine, we have reason to think,\r\nwas first advanced by governor Bernard, at a time when he became the\r\nprincipal agent in involving the nation and the Colonies in\r\ncontroversy and confusion: Very probably, it now becomes a subject of\r\ninstruction to governor Hutchinson5 who refuses to confirm the grants\r\nof the Assembly to the Agents for the respective houses. In this he\r\ncarries the point beyond Governor Bernard who assented to grants made\r\nin general terms for services performed, without holding up the name\r\nof agent: But governor Hutchinson declines his assent even in that\r\nform; so that we are reduced to a choice of difficulties, either to\r\nhave no agent at all, but such as shall be under the influence of the\r\nminister; or to find some other way to support an agent than by grants\r\nof the general assembly. - But we are fallen into times, when\r\ngovernors of colonies seem to think themselves bound to conform to\r\ninstructions, without any regard to the civil constitution, or even\r\nthe public safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Page 46, note, applies also to the authorship of this letter.\r\n2 J.

The quotation from the statute is inexact.\r\n5 Since the writing of this letter an Instruction of this kind is\r\narrived, which has been communicated by the Governor to his Majesty's\r\nCouncil; and is recorded in their Journal 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE SIGNED \"CANDIDUS.\"\r\n\r\n[Boston Gazette, July 1, 1771.]\r\n\r\nMESSIEURS EDES & GILL,\r\n\r\nThe Layman, who again appeared in Mr. Draper's last Thursday's\r\nGazette, is sollicitous to know why Candidus \"pitched upon the\r\nspecific Number seventeen, as present at the late Convention of the\r\nClergy, and voting for an Address to his Excellency the Governor; and\r\nfurther, he asks, Whether \"it was not purposely done to throw an\r\nundeserved Reproach on that reverend Body.\" - I will endeavour to\r\nanswer the Layman in a Manner not \"militating,\" as he charges me with\r\nhaving done before, \"with my assumed denomination.\" - I mentioned that\r\n\"specific number,\" because I was told by several reverend Gentlemen\r\nwho were present at the Convention, that the Address was bro't on\r\nearly, when only twenty-four had got together; and that of this\r\nnumber, seventeen only voted in favor of it. I own I thought it\r\nunlucky, that the precise Number seventeen should appear to\r\ncountenance the Address, because I agree with the Layman that it has\r\nof late become an \"obnoxious Number.\" I have Reason to think I was\r\ntruly informed; if it was a misrepresentation, the Reverend Doctor who\r\npresided at the Meeting, may set us right, if he thinks it worth his\r\nWhile. I am still of Opinion, that is immaterial to my Purpose,\r\nwhether twenty-four or thirty Gentlemen were present, when the Address\r\nwas carried through; either of those numbers being very\r\ninconsiderable, when compared with the whole Number of Congregational\r\nMinisters in the Province, which is said to be at least four Hundred.\r\nAllowing that the Number, after the Address had passed, was augmented\r\nto Sixty, and that Fifty of them were against reconsidering the\r\nMatter, it is not certainly to be inferred from thence, that all those\r\nFifty would have voted for an Address, if they had been present when\r\nit was first proposed. But however that might be, the Propriety (to\r\nsay the least) of calling it, An Address of the Congregational\r\nMinisters of the Province, when not more than about One in Seven of\r\nthem were present, or in any Likelihood ever had heard that any\r\nAddress was intended, yet remains a Question: And I again say, I\r\nshould be glad to see it reconciled with that Simplicity and Godly\r\nSincerity which we often hear inculcated from the Pulpit. - The Layman\r\nsupposes, that it is with the Convention as \"with other Corporate\r\nBodies, convened at stated Time and Place \" - Now other corporate\r\nBodies are notified of the Matters to be transacted at Time & Place;\r\nbut no Notice was given to \"the Congregational Ministers of the\r\nProvince\" that an Address to his Excellency the Governor was to\r\nbe proposed; and as this is said to be the first Instance of an\r\n\r\nAddress to a Governor ever made by the Convention, it is not\r\nlikely that seven-eighths of them, who were absent, ever had it in\r\ncontemplation. But after all, I would ask, \"with Modesty, Decency,\r\nand Charity,\" and with Humility too, all which I take to be\r\nexcellent Christian Graces, as well as Sincerity; by what\r\nAuthority is the Convention of the Clergy, as it is called,\r\nconstituted \"a corporate Body\"? I am nevertheless, with all due\r\nRespect to the Ministers of the Congregational Churches,\r\n\r\nYour's,\r\nCANDIDUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. Perhaps an Address of Thanks from the Convention of the\r\nReverend & very venerable Dr. Chauncy, for his excellent Defence\r\nof their ecclesiastic Constitution, at a Time when they stood in\r\nneed of so able a Defender, may be judg'd by some to be rather\r\nmore in Character than a political Address to the Man in Power\r\nC.\r\n\r\nPostscript the 2d. I am inform'd that it was first propos'd to\r\naddress his Excellency at Cambridge, after Dinner on the Day of\r\nElection, and that the Reason assign'd for it was, because it had\r\nbeen unjustly asserted that his had stood Sponsor at a Christening\r\n- The Truth of which Assertion, however, it is also said, might\r\nhave been made evident by enquiring of a worthy Clergyman of the\r\nChurch of England in that Town,\r\nC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ARTHUR LEE.\r\n\r\n[R. H. Lee, Life of Arthur Lee, vol. ii., pp. 173-577.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, July 31st, 1771.\r\n\r\nSIR,-\r\n\r\nSince I received your favour of the 28th of March, I have observed\r\nby the London papers that the lord-mayor and alderman are\r\nliberated. From the wisdom and firmness which formerly\r\ndistinguished that opulent and independent city, we expected that\r\nwhen they had so fair an occasion for exerting themselves, the\r\npower which has too long oppressed and insulted the nation and the\r\ncolonies, would have been made to bend. But we have seen\r\ncomplimentary letters and addresses to the imprisoned gentlemen,\r\nand their answers; while by a stretch of arbitrary power they have\r\nbeen kept in confinement, till by a prorogation instead of a\r\ndissolution, they have been discharged of course. Is this my\r\nfriend a matter of such triumph? Does it not show that Britons are\r\nunfeeling to their condition? Or has brutal force at length become\r\nso formidable, that after having in vain petitioned those whose\r\nduty it is to redress their grievances, they are afraid to imitate\r\nthe virtue of their ancestors in similar cases, and redress their\r\ngrievances themselves?\r\n\r\nMr. Hume, if I mistake not, somewhere says, that if James the\r\nSecond had had the benefit of the riot-act, and such a standing\r\narmy as has been granted since his time, it would have been\r\nimpracticable for the nation to have wrought its own delivery, and\r\nestablish the constitution of '88. If the people have put it in\r\nthe power of a wicked and corrupt ministry to make themselves\r\nabsolute lords and tyrants over them by means of a standing army,\r\nwe may at present pity them under the misfortune; but future\r\nhistorians will record the story with astonishment and\r\nindignation, and posterity, who will share in the fatal effects of\r\ntheir folly and treachery, will accuse them. Has there not for a\r\nlong time past been reason to apprehend the designs of a restless\r\nfaction to oppress the nation; and the more easily to affect their\r\npurposes, to render the king's government obnoxious, and if\r\npossible put an end to a family which has heretofore supported the\r\nrights of the nation, its happiness and grandeur?\r\n\r\nIn this colony we are every day experiencing the miserable effects\r\nof arbitrary power. The people are paying the unrighteous tribute,\r\n(I wish I could say they were groaning under it, for that would\r\nseem as if they felt they are submitting to it,) in hopes that the\r\nnation will at length revert to justice. But before that time\r\ncomes, it is to be feared they will be so accustomed to bondage,\r\nas to forget they were ever free. Swarms of locusts and\r\ncaterpillars are maintained by this tribute in luxury and\r\nsplendour, and a standing army, (not in the city thank God, since\r\nthe 5th March 1770, but within call upon occasion). While our\r\nindependent governor is found to crouch to his superiors, and to\r\nlook down upon and sneer at those below him, he is from time to\r\ntime receiving instructions how to govern this people, to govern!\r\nrather to harass and insult his country in distress. . .where his\r\nadulating priestlings are reminding him he was born and educated,\r\nforgetting perhaps if they ever knew, that the tyrants of Rome\r\nwere the natives of Rome. Among other edicts which have been\r\nlately sent to this governor, there is one which prohibits his\r\nassenting to any tax-bill, unless the commissioners and other\r\nofficers, whose salaries are not paid out of moneys granted by\r\nthis government, are exempted from a tax on the profits of their\r\ncommissions. Nothing that I can say will heighten the resentment\r\nof a man of sense and virtue against such a mandate; and yet our\r\ngovernor would have us think it is a mark of his paternal\r\ngoodness. Another instruction forbids the governor to give his\r\nassent to grants to any agent, unless he is appointed by a law of\r\nthe province, or a resolve of the assembly, to which his\r\nexcellency consents. And a third requires him to refuse his assent\r\nto a future election of such councillors as shall presume to meet\r\ntogether as a council, without being summoned by him into his\r\npresence. These instructions, so humiliating to the council, the\r\nsecretary by the governor's order has entered on their journals\r\n\r\nIt has been observed that the nearer any man approaches to an\r\nabsolute independence, the more he will be flattered; and flattery\r\nis always great in proportion as the motives of flatterers are\r\nbad. These observations are so disgraceful to human nature that I\r\nwish I could say they were not founded in experience. Perhaps\r\nthere never was a man in this province more flattered, or who bore\r\nit better, I mean who was better pleased with it, than Governor\r\nHutchinson. You have seen Miss in her teens, surrounded with dying\r\nlovers, praising her gay ribbons, the dimples in her cheeks or the\r\ntip of her ear! In imitation of the mother country, whom we are\r\ntoo apt to imitate in fopperies, addresses have been procured and\r\npresented to his excellency, chiefly from dependants and\r\nexpectants. Indeed some of the clergy have run into the stream of\r\ncivility, which is the more astonishing, when it is considered\r\nthat they altogether depend upon the ability and good disposition\r\nof their parishes for their support. But it is certain that not a\r\nfifth part, some say not an eighth part of the clergy, were\r\npresent. It cannot, therefore, be said to be the language of the\r\nbody of the clergy, and all ages have seen that some of that order\r\nhave ever been ready to sacrifice the rights as well as the\r\nhonoured religion of their country, to the smiles of the great. It\r\nis a sore mortification that the independent house of\r\nrepresentatives, and the town of Boston have refused to make their\r\ncompliments to a man, whose administration since the departure of\r\nthe Nettleham Baronet, they can by no means approve of. From hence\r\nyou will judge whether these addresses speak the sentiments of the\r\npeople in general, or are any more than the foul breath of\r\nsycophants and hirelings.\r\n\r\nThe province of North Carolina, by accounts from thence, appears\r\nto have been involved in a civil war. It is the general opinion\r\nhere that the people in the back parts of that province have been\r\ngreatly oppressed, and that the governor, instead of hearkening to\r\ntheir complaints and redressing their grievances, has raised an\r\narmy and spilt their blood. This it must be confessed, is treating\r\nthe people under his government much in the same manner as his\r\nsuperiors have treated the nation and the colonies. But their\r\nexample may prove dangerous to be followed by a plantation\r\ngovernor. At this distance from Carolina we have not yet received\r\na perfect account from thence. I hope your friends in the adjacent\r\ncolony of Virginia have wrote you particularly of this important\r\nmatter. Tryon has arrived at New York, where he is appointed\r\ngovernor. He has already been addressed with all the expressions\r\nof court sincerity, and perhaps he may hereafter receive the\r\nreward of a baronet for his fidelity and courage. 'When vice\r\nprevails and impious men bear sway, the post of honour is the\r\nprivate station.'\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE SIGNED \"CANDIDUS.\"\r\n\r\n[Boston Gazette, August 5, 1771.j\r\n\r\nMessieurs EDES & GILL,\r\n\r\nOne who stiles himself, in Mr. Draper's paper, a Layman, having\r\nrepeatedly endeavoured in vain to make the Public believe, that\r\nthe paper presented to governor Hutchinson, by about a fifth part,\r\naccording to his own account, and as others say, not more than an\r\neighth part of the congregational ministers of this province,\r\nought still to be called \"an address of the congregational\r\nministers of this province\"; and that its being thus represented\r\nin the newspapers, did not betray any want of that simplicity and\r\ngodly sincerity, which we have so often heard inculcated from the\r\npulpit; and what is still more extraordinary in a vindication of\r\nreverend addressers, having sneer'd at me for expressing my regard\r\nfor these and other eminent christian graces, which however, I\r\nhave reason to hope are the peculiar ornaments of the generality\r\nof the ministers of that denomination; I say, after all this, he\r\nproceeds to tell us, that there never has been an instance of a\r\nmajority of the clergy present at any convention; and that the\r\nindividuals who compose that reverend corporate body, as he would\r\nfain have us think it to be, have never before been notified of\r\nsuch political or other matters as a few of them may have taken it\r\ninto their heads to transact at any future time or place - Are we\r\nto infer from thence by any means, that it was fair to call this\r\nthe address of the body of the congregational ministers of the\r\nprovince? For so it was manifestly intended to be understood, and\r\nso it is plain his Excellency himself chose to understand it, as\r\nappears by his calling it in his answer, \"so kind, so affectionate\r\nan address, from so respectable and venerable a body of men \" -\r\nAye, but says the Layman, it has been customary for a minority of\r\nthe congregational ministers of the province, to meet in\r\nconvention, and address the new governors, without notifying the\r\nmajority of them, (who have always been absent) of the matter. If\r\nthis be true, it argues that such former addresses can no more\r\nthan the last, be fairly called addresses of the body of the\r\nclergy, or be so represented or receive - This Layman, as he calls\r\nhimself, mentions the convention in one of his performances, as\r\nacting like \"other corporate bodies,\" at the meetings of which the\r\npresence of a majority of the members may not be necessary to\r\nwarrant their proceedings; but he does not incline to answer my\r\nquestion, viz. When and by whom they were incorporated? But if\r\nthey had been a corporate body, the members should have been duly\r\nwarned of the matters to be transacted, as well as the time and\r\nplace; otherwise, who does not know that their proceedings must be\r\ninvalid? To be sure if, without such notification, not a sixth\r\npart of them should be present, which is the fact, no one in his\r\nsenses would plead that they could with fairness be called the\r\nproceedings of that corporate body - However, thus it has been\r\nrepresented by the Layman: The reverend addressers themselves,\r\ncall their address, \"An address of the ministers of the\r\ncongregational churches in the province,\" and his Excellency\r\nreceives it very kindly, as coming from so \"respectable and\r\nvenerable a body \" - Whatever some of those reverend gentlemen, (I\r\ncare not how small a number is supposed, for I would be tender of\r\nthe character of the cloth,) I say, whether some of them might not\r\nthink, that if the address was supposed to be the declared\r\nsentiment of the whole body of the clergy of the province, it\r\nwould be further supposed, to speak the sentiments of the whole\r\nbody of the people of the province, and whether they were not\r\nunder this temptation to give their address so pompous an\r\nintroduction, I will not presume to say; I shall only in my usual\r\nway, and with my usual modesty, as the Layman witnesses, ask\r\nwhether there is not reason to think it. If this was actually the\r\ncase, I will just remark, that though the body of the people of\r\nthis province, treat the clergy, as I hope they always will, with\r\nall due respect, yet they are not priest-ridden as in some other\r\nparts of the world, and I hope in God they never will be - They\r\nclaim a right of private judgment; and they will always venture to\r\nexpress their own sentiments of men or things, of politicks or\r\nreligion, against the sentiments of the clergy, whenever they\r\nthink the clergy in the wrong\r\n\r\nThis indefatigable Layman threatens to \"chastise\" me for falshood,\r\nin saying I had heard, or \"it is said\" that this is the first\r\ninstance of an address ever made to a governor by the convention;\r\nbut strictly speaking it was truly said, according to his own\r\naccount; for if a majority of the members which compose the\r\nconvention, have never met, nor any of the members ever been\r\nnotified of time, place or matters to be transacted, how can any\r\nact be said to have been the act of the convention? But this is\r\nnot what I intended - I was told, or to use my own words, it was\r\nsaid in my hearing, that this was the first address to a governor\r\never made by the convention: I understood it to be the first\r\naddress ever made to a governor by any number of ministers calling\r\nthemselves the ministers of the congregational churches of this\r\nprovince met in convention: The Layman has convinced me that I was\r\nmisinformed: Does it follow that I am chargeable with falshood? a\r\ngross violation of truth? Fie, fie, Layman! As your client's cause\r\nrequires the utmost candor, learn to exercise a little of it\r\ntowards others; it is a shame for you to rail in behalf of the\r\nclergy - An instance is bro't of an address to Governor Pownal,\r\nand another to Bernard! But in neither of these instances, as the\r\nLayman tells us, were the members of the convention notified, or\r\nthe majority of them present. Perhaps only SEVENTEEN met, and an\r\nhour before the usual time, as was said by one of the convention\r\nto be the case, when the late address was first carried. The\r\nLayman indeed insists upon twenty-four; it is immaterial as I said\r\nbefore, since either of these numbers is inconsiderable, in\r\ncomparison with 300, some say 400 ministers of that denomination\r\nin the province. If the Layman thinks it material, I am sorry the\r\nRev. Dr. who presided at the meeting, though repeatedly requested,\r\nwill not condescend to ascertain it for him - With regard to\r\naddresses to governors upon their promotion, so far as it can be\r\npresumed that they are well qualified and well dispos'd to employ\r\ntheir shining talents, (for such they all have, if we are to\r\nbelieve the late addresses here and elsewhere,) and to make\r\nthemselves \"diffusive blessings in their exalted stations,\" those\r\nof the clergy and others, who are so very fond of congratulating,\r\nlet them congratulate, if they please. I believe many of the\r\nclergymen who congratulated the Nettleham baronet, and others\r\nbesides, have since been fully convinced that they have no reason\r\nto pride themselves in it. The truth is, every man in power will\r\nbe adulated by some sort of men in every country, because he is a\r\nman in power - TRYON arrives from the bloody scenes of Alamance,\r\nand receives the high encomiums of New York, the clergy as well as\r\nothers, for having \"saved a sister colony\" by his noble exploit;\r\nand another is flattered as being the \"father of his country,\" and\r\n\"the delight of an obliged and grateful people,\" by those very men\r\nwho now detest the administration of BERNARD whom they had before\r\ncannonized, altho' he has assured his noble patron, and many\r\nbelieve it, that this Father of his country is just such an one as\r\nhimself; that he is pushing forward with the utmost vehemence,\r\ntho' in different modes, the same measures, and that he may be\r\ndepended upon by his Lordship equally with himself. I am with\r\ngreat respect to the congregational ministers,\r\n\r\nCANDIDUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE SIGNED \"CANDIDUS.\r\n\r\n[Boston Gazette, August 19, 1771.]\r\n\r\nMessieurs Edes & Gill.\r\n\r\nIt has become of late so fashionable for some persons to make\r\ntheir addresses to every one whom they call a great man, that one\r\ncan hardly look upon them as the genuine marks of respect to any\r\none who is really a good man. Their addresses seem to spring\r\naltogether from political views; and without the least regard to\r\nthe character or merit of the persons whom they profess to\r\ncompliment in them. From the observations I have been able to\r\nmake, I have been led to think that one of their designs in\r\naddressing, is to give occasion to my Lord of H- and other great\r\nmen to think, or at least to say it, whether they think so or not,\r\nthat the scales have at length fallen from the eyes of the people\r\nof this town and province; and that in consequence thereof, they\r\nhave altered their sentiments, & are become perfectly reconciled\r\nto the whole system of ministerial measures; for otherwise, they\r\nmight argue, could they possibly be so liberal in their addresses and\r\ncompliments to those persons who are employed, and no question, are\r\nvery active in carrying those measures into execution. But I should\r\nthink that if a question of this consequence, namely, Whether the\r\npeople have altered their sentiments in so interesting a point, is to\r\nbe decided by their apparent disposition to compliment this or that\r\nparticular gentleman, because he is employed in the service of\r\nadministration in America, it would be the fairest method to call a\r\nmeeting of the inhabitants of the Town, duly notifying them of the\r\noccasion of the meeting, and let the matter be fully debated if needbe,\r\nand determined by a vote. Every one would then see, if the vote\r\nwas carried in favour of addressing, or which upon my supposition\r\nis the same thing, in favour of the measures of administration,\r\nwhether it obtain'd by a large or small majority of the whole; and\r\nwe might come to the knowledge of the very persons, which is much\r\nto be desired, as well as the weight of understanding and property\r\non each side.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I cannot but at present be of opinion, and \"I\r\nhave reason to believe\" that my opinion is well founded, that the\r\nmeasures of the British administration of the colonies, are still\r\nas disgustful and odious to the inhabitants of this respectable\r\nmetropolis in general, as they ever have been:\r\nAnd I will venture further to add, that nothing, in my opinion,\r\ncan convey a more unjust idea of the spirit of a true American,\r\nthan to suppose he would even compliment, much less make an\r\nadulating address to any person sent here to trample on the Rights\r\nof his Country; or that he would ever condescend to kiss the hand\r\nwhich is ready prepared to rivet his own fetters - There are among\r\nus, it must be confess'd, needy expectants and dependents; and a\r\nfew others of sordid and base minds, form'd by nature to bend and\r\ncrouch even to little great men: - But whoever thinks, that by the\r\nmost refined art and assiduous application of the most ingenious\r\npolitical oculist, the \"public eye\" can yet look upon the chains\r\nwhich are forg'd for them, or upon those detestable men who are\r\nemploy'd to put them on, without abhorrence and indignation, are\r\nvery much mistaken - I only wish that my Countrymen may be upon\r\ntheir guard against being led by the artifices of the tools of\r\nAdministration, into any indiscreet measures, from whence they may\r\ntake occasion to give such a coloring. \"There have been, says the\r\ncelebrated American Farmer, in every age and in every country bad\r\nmen: Men who either hold or expect to hold certain advantages by\r\nfitting examples of SERVILITY to their countrymen: Who train'd to\r\nthe employment, or self-taught by a natural versatility of genius,\r\nserve as decoys for drawing the innocent and unwary into snares.\r\nIt is not to be doubted but that such men will diligently bestir\r\nthemselves on this and every like occasion, to spread the\r\ninfection of their meanness as far as they can. On the plans they\r\nhave adopted this is their course. This is the method to recommend\r\nthemselves to their patrons. They act consistently in a bad cause.\r\nThey run well in a mean race. From them we shall learn, how\r\npleasant and profitable a thing it is, to be, for our submissive\r\nbehavior, well spoken of at St. James's or St. Stephen's, at\r\nGuildhall or the Royal Exchange.\"\r\n\r\nWe cannot surely have forgot the accursed designs of a most\r\ndetestable set of men, to destroy the Liberties of America as with\r\none blow, by the Stamp-Act; nor the noble and successful efforts\r\nwe then made to divert the impending stroke of ruin aimed at\r\nourselves and our posterity. The Sons of Liberty on the 14th of\r\nAugust 1765, a Day which ought to be for ever remembered in\r\nAmerica, animated with a zeal for their country then upon the\r\nbrink of destruction, and resolved, at once to save her, or like\r\nSamson, to perish in the ruins, exerted themselves with such\r\ndistinguished vigor, as made the house of Dogon to shake from its\r\nvery foundation; and the hopes of the lords of the Philistines\r\neven while their hearts were merry, and when they were\r\nanticipating the joy of plundering this continent, were at that\r\nvery time buried in the pit they had digged. The People shouted;\r\nand their shout was heard to the distant end of this Continent. In\r\neach Colony they deliberated and resolved, and every Stampman\r\ntrembled; and swore by his Maker, that he would never execute a\r\ncommission which he had so infamously received\r\n\r\nWe cannot have forgot, that at the very Time when the stamp-act\r\nwas repealed, another was made in which the Parliament of Great-\r\nBritain declared, that they had right and authority to make any\r\nlaws whatever binding on his Majesty's subjects in America - How\r\nfar this declaration can be consistent with the freedom of his\r\nMajesty's subjects in America, let any one judge who pleases - In\r\nconsequence of such right and authority claim'd, the commons of\r\nGreat Britain very soon fram'd a bill and sent it up to the Lords,\r\nwherein they pray'd his Majesty to accept of their grant of such a\r\npart as they were then pleas'd, by virtue of the right and\r\nauthority inherent in them to make, of the property of his\r\nMajesty's subjects in America by a duty upon paper, glass,\r\npainter's colours and tea. And altho' these duties are in part\r\nrepeal'd, there remains enough to answer the purpose of\r\nadministration, which was to fix the precedent. We remember the\r\npolicy of Mr. Grenville, who would have been content for the\r\npresent with a pepper corn establish'd as a revenue in America: If\r\ntherefore we are voluntarily silent while the single duty on tea\r\nis continued, or do any act, however innocent, simply considered,\r\nwhich may be construed by the tools of administration, (some of\r\nwhom appear to be fruitful in invention) as an acquiescence in the\r\nmeasure, we are in extreme hazard; if ever we are so distracted as\r\nto consent to it, we are undone.\r\n\r\nNor can we ever forget the indignity and abuse with which America\r\nin general, and this province and town in particular, have been\r\ntreated, by the servants & officers of the crown, for making a\r\nmanly resistance to the arbitrary measures of administration, in\r\nthe representations that have been made to the men in power at\r\nhome, who have always been dispos'd to believe every word as\r\ninfallible truth. For opposing a threatned Tyranny, we have been\r\nnot only called, but in effect adjudged Rebels & Traitors to the\r\nbest of Kings, who has sworn to maintain and defend the Rights and\r\nLiberties of his Subjects - We have been represented as inimical to\r\nour fellow subjects in Britain, because we have boldly asserted those\r\nRights and Liberties, wherewith they, as Subjects, are made free.\r\n-When we complain'd of this injurious treatment; when we\r\npetition'd,and remonstrated our grievances: What was the Consequence?\r\nStill further indignity; and finally a formal invasion of this town by\r\na fleet and army in the memorable year 1768.\r\n\r\nOur masters, military and civil, have since that period been\r\nfrequently chang'd; and possibly some of them, from principles\r\nmerely political, may of late have look'd down upon us with less\r\nsternness in their countenances than a BERNARD or a . . .: But\r\nwhile there has been no essential alteration of measures, no real\r\nredress of grievances, we have no reason to think, nay we deceive\r\nourselves if we indulge a thought that their hearts are changed.\r\nWe cannot entertain such an imagination, while the revenue, or as\r\nit is more justly stiled, the TRIBUTE is extorted from us: while\r\nour principal fortress, within the environs of the town, remains\r\ngarrison'd by regular troops, and the harbour is invested by ships\r\nof war. The most zealous advocates for the measures of\r\nadministration, will not pretend to say, that these troops and\r\nthese ships are sent here to protect America, or to carry into\r\nexecution any one plan, form'd for the honor or advantage of\r\nGreat-Britain. It would be some alleviation, if we could be\r\nconvinced that they were sent here with any other design than to\r\ninsult us.\r\n\r\nHow absurd then must the addresses which have been presented to\r\nsome particular gentlemen, who have made us such friendly visits,\r\nappear in the eyes of men of sense abroad! Or, if any of them have\r\nbeen so far impos'd upon, as to be induc'd to believe that such\r\naddresses speak the language of the generality of the people, how\r\nridiculous must the generality of the people appear! On the last\r\nsupposition, would not a sensible reader of those addresses, upon\r\ncomparing them with the noble resolutions which this town, this\r\nprovince and this continent have made against SLAVERY, and the\r\njust and warm resentment they have constantly shown against EVERY\r\nman whatever, who had a mind sordid and base enough, for the sake\r\nof lucre, or the preservation of a commission, or from any other\r\nconsideration, to submit to be made even a remote instrument in\r\nbringing and entailing it upon a free and a brave people; upon\r\nsuch a comparison, would he not be ready to conclude, \"that we had\r\nforgot the reasons which urged us, with unexampled unanimity a few\r\nyears ago - that our zeal for the public good had worn out, before\r\nthe homespun cloaths which it had caused us to have made - and,\r\nthat by our present conduct we condemned our own late successful\r\nexample! -Although this is altogether supposition, without any\r\nfoundation in truth, yet, so our enemies wish it may be in\r\nreality, and so they intend it shall be - To prevent it, let us\r\nADHERE TO FIRST PRINCIPLES.

Under the influence of\r\nthe wisest administration which has ever appeared since the\r\npresent reign began: The hateful act was at length repeal'd; to\r\nthe joy of every friend to the rights of mankind in Britain, and\r\nof all America, except the few who either from the prospect of\r\ngain by it, or from an inveterate envy which they had before and\r\nhave ever since discovered, of the general happiness of the people\r\nof America, were the promoters if not the original framers of it.\r\nThis restless faction could not bear to see the Americans restored\r\nto the possession of their rights and liberties, and sitting once\r\nmore in security under their own vines and their own fig trees:\r\nUnwearied in their endeavours to introduce an absolute tyranny\r\ninto this country, to which they were instigated, some from the\r\nprinciples of ambition or a lust of power, and others from an\r\ninordinate love of money which is the root of all evil, and which\r\nhad before possessed the hearts of those who had undertaken to\r\ndistribute the stamped papers, they met together in cabal and laid\r\na new plan to render the people of this continent tributary to the\r\nmother country - Having finished their part of the plan, their\r\nindefatigable Randolph was dispatched to Great-Britain to\r\ncommunicate it to the fraternity there, in order that it might be\r\nripen'd and bro't to perfection: But even before his embarkation,\r\nhe could not help discovering his own weakness, by giving a broad\r\nhint of the design - This parricide pretended that his intention\r\nin making a voyage to England at that time, was to settle a\r\nprivate affair of his own; that he had nothing else in view; and\r\nthat having settled that private affair, he should immediately\r\nreturn, and as he express'd it, lay his bones in his native\r\ncountry. Full of the appearance of love for his country, he\r\nexpress'd the greatest solicitude to do the best service he could\r\nfor it, while in England; but unluckily drop'd a question, strange\r\nand inconsistent as it may appear to the reader, \"What do you\r\nthink, sir, of a small Duty upon divers articles of importation\r\nfrom Great-Britain?\" No sooner had he arriv'd in London, than the\r\nnews was dispatch'd from the friends of America there, of a design\r\nto lay a duty upon paper, glass, painter's colours, and tea\r\nimported into America, with the sole purpose of raising a revenue\r\n- The lucrative commission which he obtain'd while in England, in\r\nconsequence of the passing of the act of parliament, whereby he\r\nwas appointed one of the principal managers of this very revenue,\r\naffords but little room to doubt what his intention was in his\r\nvoyage to London, notwithstanding his warm professions of concern\r\nfor his native country - It is not always a security against a\r\nman's sacrificing a country, that he was born and educated in it.\r\nThe Tyrants of Rome were Natives of Rome. Such men indeed incur a\r\nguilt of a much deeper dye, than Strangers, who commit no such\r\nviolation of duty and of feeling. - There was another of the cabal\r\nwho embark'd about the same time, but he was call'd out of this\r\nlife before he reach'd London, and de mortuis nil dico - Of the\r\nliving I shall speak, as occasion shall call for it, with a\r\nbecoming freedom.\r\n\r\nThe whole continent was justly alarmed at the parliament's\r\nresuming the measure of raising a revenue in America without their\r\nconsent, which had so nearly operated the ruin of the whole\r\nBritish empire but a few months before; & that this odious measure\r\nshould be taken, so soon after the happy coalition between Britain\r\nand the colonies which the repeal of the stamp-act had occasion'd\r\nfor if one may judge by the most likely appearances, the\r\naffections of her colonists, were upon this great event, more\r\nstrongly attached to the mother country if possible, than ever\r\nthey had been. But the great men there had been made to believe\r\notherwise - Nay the governor of this province had gone such a\r\nlength as to assure them, that the design of the Americans in\r\ntheir opposition to the stamp-act, was to bring the authority of\r\nparliament into contempt - Many of his adherents privately wrote\r\nto the same purpose - All which had a tendency to break that\r\nharmony, which after the only interruption that had ever taken\r\nplace and that of short continuance, had been renewed, and\r\ndoubtless would have been confirmed to mutual advantage for ages,\r\nhad it not been for that pestilent few, who first to aggrandize\r\nthemselves and their families, interrupted the harmony, and then\r\nto preserve their own importance, took every step their malice\r\ncould invent, with the advantage they had gain'd of a confidence\r\nwith the ministry, to prevent it's ever being restored.\r\n\r\nUpon the fatal news (fatal, I call it, for I very much fear it will\r\nprove so in its consequences, how remote I will not take upon me to\r\npredict) upon the news of the passing of another revenue act, the\r\ncolonies immediately took such measures as were dictated to them, not\r\nby passion and rude clamour, but by the voice of reason and a just\r\nregard to the safety of themselves and their posterity. The assembly\r\nof this province, being the first I suppose who had the opportunity of\r\nmeeting, prepared and forwarded a humble, dutiful & loyal petition to\r\nthe King1 and wrote letters to such of the British nobility2 and\r\ngentry as had before discovered themselves friends to the rights of\r\nAmerica & of mankind, beseeching their interposition and influence on\r\ntheir behalf. At the same time they wrote a circular letter to each of\r\nthe other colonies3, letting them know the steps they had taken and\r\ndesiring their advice & joint Assistance - This letter had its\r\ndifferent effects; on the one hand, in the deep resentment of my Lord\r\nof Hillsborough, who was pleased to call it \"a measure of an\r\ninflamatory nature - Evidently tending to create unwarrantable\r\ncombinations, to excite an unjustifiable opposition to the\r\nconstitutional authority of parliament and to revive unhappy divisions\r\nand distractions,\" &c. While on the other hand, the colonies, as\r\nappears by their respective polite answers, receiv'd it with the\r\nhighest marks of approbation, as a token of sincere affection to them,\r\n& a regard to the common safety; and they severally proceeded to take\r\nconcurrent measures. No one step I believe, united the colonies\r\nmore than this letter; excepting his lordship's endeavors by his\r\nown circular letter to the colonies, to give it a different turn -\r\nBut however decent and loyal -However warrantable by or rather\r\nconformable to the spirit and the written rules of the British\r\nconstitution, the petitions of right and other applications of the\r\ndistressed Americans were, they shared the same fate which those\r\nof London, Westminster, Middlesex, & other great cities & counties\r\nhave since met with! No redress of grievances ensued: Not even the\r\nleast disposition in administration to listen to our petitions;\r\nwhich is not so much to be wondered at, when we consider the\r\ntemper of the ministry, which was incessantly acted upon by\r\nGovernor Bernard in such kind of language as this \"The authority\r\nof the King, the supremacy of parliament, the superiority of\r\ngovernment are the real objects of the attack\"; while nothing is\r\nmore certain, than that the house of representatives of this\r\nprovince in their petition to the king, and in all their letters,\r\nthat in particular which was address'd to the other colonies, the\r\nsentiment of which was recogniz'd by them, expressly declare,\r\n\"that his Majesty's high court of parliament is the supreme\r\nlegislative power over the whole empire, in all cases which can\r\nconsist with the fundamental rights of the constitution,\" and that\r\n\"it was never questioned in this province, nor as they conceive in\r\nany other.\" They indeed in all their letters insist upon the right\r\nof granting their own money, as a right founded in nature, the\r\nexercise of which no man ever relinquished to another & remain'd\r\nfree - A right therefore which no power on earth, not even the\r\nacknowledged supreme legislative power over the whole empire hath\r\nany authority to divest them of - \"The supreme power says Mr.\r\nLocke, is not, nor can possibly be absolutely arbitrary, over the\r\nlives and fortunes of the people - The supreme power cannot take\r\nfrom any man any part of his property without his own consent. For\r\nthe preservation of property being the end of government, and that\r\nfor which men enter into society; it necessarily supposes and\r\nrequires that the people should have property, without which they\r\nmust be supposed to lose that by entering into society, which was\r\nthe end for which they entered into it. Men therefore in society\r\nhaving property, they have such a right to the goods which by the\r\nlaw of the community are theirs, that no body hath a right to take\r\ntheir substance or any part of it from them without their consent.\r\nWithout this, they have no property at all: For I have truly no\r\nproperty in that, which another can by right take from me when he\r\npleases, against my consent\" - These are the principles upon which\r\nalone, the Americans founded their opposition to the late acts of\r\nparliament. How then could governor Bernard with any colour of\r\ntruth declare to a minister of state in general terms, that \"the\r\nauthority of the King, the supremacy of parliament, the\r\nsuperiority of government, were the objects of the attack?\" Upon\r\nthe principles of reason and nature, their opposition is\r\njustifiable: For by those acts the property of the Colonists is\r\ntaken from them without their consent. It is by no means\r\nsufficient to console us, that the duty is reduced to the single\r\narticle of Tea, which by the way is not a fact; but if it should\r\nbe admitted, it is because the parliament for the present are\r\npleased to demand no more of us: Should we acquiesce in their\r\ntaking three pence only because they please, we at least tacitly\r\nconsent that they should have the sovereign controul of our\r\npurses; and when they please they will claim an equal right, and\r\nperhaps plead a precedent for it, to take a shilling or a pound -\r\nAt present we have the remedy in our own hands; we can easily\r\navoid paying the TRIBUTE, by abstaining from the use of those\r\narticles by which it is extorted from us: - and further, we can\r\nlook upon our haughty imperious taskmasters, and all those who are\r\nsent here to aid and abet them, together with those sons of\r\nservility, who from very false notions of politeness, can seek and\r\ncourt opportunities of cringing and fawning at their feet, of\r\nwhom, thro' favor, there are but few among us: we may look down\r\nupon all these, with that sovereign contempt and indignation, with\r\nwhich those who feel their own dignity and freedom, will for ever\r\nview the men, who would attempt to reduce them to the disgraceful\r\nstate of SLAVERY.\r\n\r\nI shall continue to send you an account of facts, as my leisure\r\nwill admit. In the mean time,\r\n\r\nI am yours,\r\nCANDIDUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Vol. I., page 162.\r\n2 Vol. I., pages 152, i66, 169, 173, 180.\r\n3 Vol. I., page 184.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE SIGNED \"CANDIDUS.\"\r\n\r\n[Boston Gazette, September 16, 1771.]\r\n\r\nMessieurs EDES & GILL,\r\n\r\n1 have already mentioned the circular letter written by the house\r\nof representatives of this province to the other colonies, dated\r\nthe 11th of February, 1768; and the very different treatment it\r\nmet with from the Earl of Hillsborough and the respectable bodies\r\nto whom it was addressed. And also the circular letter which his\r\nlordship himself was pleased to send to those colonies, wherein he\r\nrecommended to them \"to treat it with the contempt it deserved \" -\r\nBut as the sentiments contained in the letter of the house were so\r\nexactly similar to those of the other colonies, and the subject of\r\nit was of equal importance to them all, it was not in the power of\r\nhis lordship to efface the impressions it made, or to disturb that\r\nharmony which was the happy effect of it - Vis unita fortior -\r\nThat union of the colonies in their common danger, by which they\r\nbecame powerful, was the occasion of the greatest perplexity to\r\ntheir enemies on both sides the atlantick; and it has been ever\r\nsince their constant endeavor by all manner of arts to destroy it.\r\nIn this, it must be confess'd, they have discovered an unanimity, zeal\r\nand\r\nperseverance, worthy to be imitated by those who are embark'd in\r\nthe cause of American freedom. - It is by united councils, a\r\nsteady zeal, and a manly fortitude, that this continent must\r\nexpect to recover its violated rights and liberties.\r\n\r\nSuch was the resentment which the circular letter enkindled in the\r\nbreasts of administration, that it was immediately followed by a\r\nMandate from lord  Hillsborough to governor Bernard, to require the\r\nsucceeding house to rescind the resolution which had given birth to\r\nit, upon pain of a dissolution of the assembly in case of a refusal. -\r\nGovernor Bernard added to the severity of this mandate by assuring the\r\nhouse in a message to them, that \"if he should be obliged to dissolve\r\nthe general court, he should not think himself at liberty to call\r\nanother, till he should receive his Majesty's command for that\r\npurpose.\"   - It appeared that administration had been greatly\r\nmisinformed with regard to the circumstances of this resolution of the\r\nhouse, particularly in a representation that it was brought on when\r\nthe members present were few, and at the end of the session; and that\r\nit was therefore a very unfair proceeding procured by surprize and\r\ncontrary to the real sense of the house - But the house made it\r\nevident in their letter to his lordship afterwards, from their own\r\nminutes and journals, that it was the declared sense of a large\r\nmajority when the house was full - It was the constant practice of\r\ngovernor Bernard and his adherents, to represent the opposition of the\r\nhouse to the pernicious designs of the enemies of the colonies,\r\nwhich generally consisted of full three quarters of the members\r\nand sometimes more, as the feeble efforts of an expiring faction.\r\n\r\nThis direct and peremptory requisition, of a new and strange\r\nconstructure, and so strenuously urg'd by the governor, was taken\r\ninto consideration by the house, on the next day after it was laid\r\nbefore them; and as is usual in all matters of importance, was\r\nthen referred to a large committee further to consider it, and\r\nreport their opinion of what was expedient to be done: As the\r\ngovernor had assured the house in his message, that \"their\r\nresolution thereon would have the most important consequences to\r\nthe province,\" the committee were the more deliberate in their\r\nconsultations; very reasonably expecting, that after such an\r\nassurance given to the house, the governor would indulge them with\r\nsufficient time thoroughly to digest it.However sanguine the\r\nexpectation of lord Hills-borough might be, through the artful\r\ninsinuation of governor Bernard that, the \"attempts of a desperate\r\nfaction (as his lordship expressed it) would be      discountenanced,\r\nand that the execution of the measure recommended would not meet with\r\nany\r\ndifficulty;\" the governor himself, who was fully acquainted with\r\nthe sentiments of the house, as well as of the generality of the\r\npeople without doors, had no \"grounds to hope\" that the requisition\r\nwould be comply'd with; and therefore as a dissolution was to be the\r\nimmediate consequence of a refusal, and as his lordship had directed\r\nthe governor to \"transmit to him an account of their proceedings to be\r\nlaid before his Majesty, to the end that his Majesty might, if he\r\ntho't proper, lay the whole matter before his parliament,\" it might\r\nhave been well supposed that a longer time was necessary for them to\r\nstate the reasons of their own conduct, and to set the transactions of\r\nthe former house, which had been grossly misrepresented, in a true\r\npoint of light, in order to vindicate themselves, when their whole\r\nproceedings should be laid before his Majesty and the parliament.\r\n\r\nBut before the committee were ready to make their report, the\r\ngovernor sent down a message to the house, signifying that it was\r\nfull a week since he had laid his Majesty's requisition before\r\nthem, and that he could not admit of a much longer delay, without\r\nconsidering it as an answer in the negative - Upon which the\r\nhouse, being desirous that the sense of the people concerning this\r\nimportant matter might be known as explicitly as possible, which\r\nwould also have determined beyond all doubt, their sense of the\r\nrevenue acts, and the opposition made to them by the American\r\nassemblies, requested a recess of the general court, that they\r\nmight have the opportunity of taking the instructions of their\r\nconstituents. But though his lordship in his letter to the\r\ngovernor, express'd a satisfaction in \"that spirit of decency and\r\nlove of order which has discovered itself in the conduct of the\r\nmost considerable of the inhabitants of the province;\" and the\r\ngovernor himself in his speech at the close of the preceeding\r\nassembly, insinuated that matters had been conducted by a party in\r\nthe house; and declared that \"the evils which threatened this\r\ninjured country, arose from the machinations of a few, very few\r\ndiscontented men\" - \"false patriots who were sacrificing their\r\ncountry to the gratification of their own passions,\" and that it\r\nwas \"by no means to be charged upon the generality of the people,\"\r\nyet he did not think it proper to comply with the request of the\r\nhouse for a recess, that the sentiment of the generality of\" this\r\ngood people,\" as he calls them in this same speech, might be\r\ntaken. Had he not the fairest opportunity upon this motion of the\r\nhouse, if there had been any grounds for his representations that\r\nthe opposition to the revenue acts was confined to a few, very few\r\ndiscontented men, to have made it evident beyond all contradiction?\r\nBut he dared not rest the matter upon this issue: He knew very well\r\nthat it would put an end to his darling topic; and that the\r\ndetermination of the generality of the people, would put it out of his\r\npower any longer to hold up an expiring faction to administration with\r\nsuccess - A low piece of cunning, of which he was a perfect master,\r\nand which he had constantly practiced to induce them to a perseverance\r\nin their measures.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th June 1768, the committee, having maturely considered\r\nthe requisition made to the house in its nature and consequences\r\nreported a letter to the Earl of Hillsborough1 his Majesty's\r\nsecretary of state for the American department, and laid it on the\r\ntable; wherein they observe to his lordship, that a requisition of\r\nsuch a nature, to a British house of commons had been very unusual\r\nand perhaps altogether unprecedented since the revolution: That\r\nsome very aggravated representations must have been made to his\r\nMajesty of the resolution of the former house, to induce him to\r\nrequire this house to rescind it, upon pain of forfeiting their\r\nexistence - That the people in this province had attended with anxiety\r\nto the acts of the British parliament for raising a revenue in America\r\n- That this concern was not limited within the circle of a few\r\ninconsiderate persons; the most respectable for fortune, rank and\r\nstation, as well as probity and understanding in the province,\r\nwith very few exceptions, being alarm'd with apprehensions of the\r\nfatal consequences, of a power exercised in any part of the\r\nBritish empire, to command and apply the property of their fellow\r\nsubjects at discretion: That as all his Majesty's North American\r\nsubjects were alike affected by those revenue acts, the former\r\nhouse very justly supposed that each of the assemblies on the\r\ncontinent would take such methods of obtaining redress as should\r\nbe thought by them respectively to be regular and proper; and\r\nbeing desirous that the several applications should harmonize with\r\neach other, they resolved on their circular letter; wherein they\r\nonly acquainted their sister colonies with the measures they had\r\ntaken, without calling upon them to adopt those measures or any\r\nother - That this was perfectly consistent with the constitution, and\r\nthat, so far from being criminal, or a measure \"of an inflammatory\r\nnature,' it had a natural tendency to compose his majesty's subjects\r\nin the colonies, till they should obtain relief; at a time when it\r\nseem'd to be the evident design of a party, they might have said a\r\nfaction, to prevent calm, deliberate, rational and constitutional\r\nmeasures being pursued, or to stop the distresses of the people\r\nfrom reaching his Majesty's ear, and consequently to precipitate\r\nthem into a state of desperation. They therefore leave it to his\r\nlordship's impartial judgment, whether the representations that\r\nhad been made of this resolution, were not injurious to the house,\r\nand an affront to his Majesty himself. And after proceeding to\r\ngive his lordship a full detail of all the circumstances relating\r\nto the resolution which gave birth to the circular letter, and\r\nwhich they were required to rescind, they add, that they rely upon\r\nit that to petition his Majesty will not be deemed by him to be\r\ninconsistent with the British constitution; that to acquaint their\r\nfellow subjects, involved in the same distress, even if they had\r\ninvited the union of all America in one joint supplication, would not\r\nbe discountenanced by his Majesty as a \"measure of an inflammatory\r\nnature;\" and that \"when his lordship shall injustice lay a true state\r\nof those matters before his Majesty, he will no longer consider them\r\nas tending to create unwarrantable combinations, or to excitte an\r\nunjustifiable opposition to the constitutional authority of\r\nparliament.\" This is the substance of the letter; which being\r\ntwice read in the house, was accepted by a large majority of\r\nninety-two out of one hundred and five members, and ordered to be\r\ntransmitted by the speaker to his lordship as soon as might be.\r\nAfter which it was immediately mov'd, that the question be put,\r\nWhether the house would rescind the resolution of the last house\r\nwhich gave birth to the circular letter; and the question being\r\naccordingly put, it pass'd in the negative, there appearing on a\r\ndivision upon the question to be seventeen yeas and ninety-two nays.\r\nThus the house determined upon as extraordinary a mandate as\r\nperhaps was ever laid before a free assembly. - It is to us, said\r\nthe house in their message to the governor, altogether\r\nincomprehensible, that we should be required on the peril of a\r\ndissolution of the great and general court or assembly of this\r\nprovince, to rescind a resolution of a former house of\r\nrepresentatives, when it is evident that such resolution has no\r\nexistence, but as a mere historical fact. Your excellency must\r\nknow, that the resolution referred to, is, to speak in the language of\r\nthe common law, not now \"executory,\" but to all intents and purposes\r\n\"executed.\" The circular letter has been sent and answered by many of\r\nthe colonies: These answers are now in the public papers; the public\r\nwill judge of the proposals, purposes and answers. We could as well\r\nrescind those letters as the resolves; and both would be equally\r\nfruitless, if by rescinding, as the word properly imports, is meant a\r\nrepeal and nullifying of the resolution referred to. But if, as is\r\nmost probable, by the word, rescinding, is intended the passing a vote\r\nof this house, in direct and express disapprobation of the measure\r\nabove mentioned, as \"illegal, inflammatory and tending to promote\r\nunjustifiable combinations\" against his Majesty's peace, crown and\r\ndignity, we take the liberty to testify and publickly to declare, that\r\nit is the native, inherent and indefeasible right of the subject,\r\njointly or severally, to petition the King for the redress of\r\ngrievances. - And we are clearly and very firmly of Opinion that the\r\npetition of the late dutiful and loyal house, and the other very\r\norderly applications for the redress of grievances, have had the most\r\ndesirable tendencies and effects - In another part they say, \"we\r\ncannot but express our deep concern, that a measure of the late house\r\nin all respects so innocent, in most so virtuous and laudable, and as\r\nwe conceive, so truly patriotic, should be represented to\r\nadministration in the odious light of a party and factious\r\nmeasure,\" and finally they say, that in refusing to comply with\r\nthe requisition, \"they have been actuated by a conscientious and a\r\nclear and determined sense of duty to God, their King, their\r\ncountry, and their latest posterity.\" This determination of the\r\nhouse gave general satisfaction, not only to the people of this\r\nprovince, but of the other colonies also; as well as the friends\r\nof liberty in Britain. It was spoken of by all except the\r\ndisappointed few, with great applause. Indeed the essential rights\r\nof all were involved in the question: A different determination\r\nwould therefore have been to the last degree infamous and attended\r\nwith fatal consequences. Not only the right of the subjects\r\njointly to petition for the redress of grievances which all alike\r\nsuffer, but also that of communicating their sentiments freely to\r\neach other upon the subject of grievances, and the means of\r\nredress, which was the sole purport of the circular letter, would\r\nin effect have been given up. I have often thought that in this\r\ntime of common distress, it would be the wisdom of the colonists,\r\nmore frequently to correspond with, and to be more attentive to\r\nthe particular circumstances of each other. It seems of late to\r\nhave been the policy of the enemies of America to point their\r\nartillery against one province only; and artfully to draw off the\r\nattention of the other colonies, and if possible to render that\r\nsingle province odious to them, while it is suffering ministerial\r\nvengeance for the sake of the common cause. But it is hoped that\r\nthe colonies will be aware of this artifice. At this juncture an\r\nattempt to subdue one province to despotic power, is justly to be\r\nconsidered as an attempt to enslave the whole. The colonies \"form\r\none political body, of which each is a member.\" -The liberties of\r\nthe whole are invaded - It is therefore the interest of the whole\r\nto support each individual with all their weight and influence.\r\nWhen the legislative of the colony of New-York was suspended, the\r\nhouse of representatives of this province consider'd it \"as\r\nalarming to all the colonies;\" and bore their testimony against\r\nit, in a letter to their agent, the sentiments of which they\r\ndirected him to make known to his Majesty's ministers. - That\r\nsuspension, says the patriotic Pennsylvania Farmer, is a\r\nparliamentary assertion of the supreme authority of the British\r\nlegislature over these colonies in point of taxation; and is\r\nintended to COMPEL New-York into a submission to that authority.\r\nIt seems therefore to me as much a violation of the liberty of the\r\npeople of that province, and consequently of all these Colonies,\r\nas if the Parliament had sent a number of regiments (which has\r\nsince been the fate of this province) to be quartered upon them\r\ntill they should comply. - Whoever, says he, seriously considers\r\nthe matter, must perceive, that a dreadful stroke is aimed at the\r\nliberty of these Colonies: For the cause of one is the cause of\r\nall. If the parliament may lawfully deprive New-York of any of its\r\nRights, it may deprive any or all the other Colonies of their\r\nRights; and nothing can so much encourage such attempts, as a\r\nmutual inattention to the interests of each other. To divide and\r\nthus to destroy, is the first political maxim in attacking those\r\nwho are powerful by their union. - When Mr. Hampden's ship money\r\ncause for three shillings and four pence was tried, all the people\r\nof England, with anxious expectation, interested themselves in the\r\nimportant decision: And when the slightest point touching the\r\nfreedom of a single Colony is agitated, I earnestly wish, that all\r\nthe rest may with equal ardour support their sister. - These are\r\nthe generous sentiments of that celebrated writer, whom several\r\nhave made feeble attempts to answer, but no one has yet done it.\r\nMay the British American Colonies be upon their guard; and take\r\ncare lest by a mutual inattention to the interest of each other,\r\nthey at length become supine and careless of the grand cause of\r\nAmerican Liberty, and finally fall a prey to the MERCILESS HAND OF\r\nTYRANNY.\r\n\r\nI am,\r\nYour's,\r\nCANDIDUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1Vol. I., page 219.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE SIGNED \"CANDIDUS.\"\r\n\r\n[Boston Gazette, September 23, 1771.]\r\n\r\nMessieurs EDES & GILL,\r\n\r\nThe consequence of the determination of the house of\r\nRepresentatives not to rescind the resolution of the former house,\r\nof which I gave you a particular account in my last, was an\r\nimmediate prorogation of the general assembly, and the next day a\r\ndissolution, agreeable to the orders of a minister of state! -\r\nGovernor Bernard in a subsequent letter to lord Hillsborough,\r\npressed his lordship for further orders respecting the calling a\r\nnew assembly; and acquainted him that \"when the usual time should\r\ncome, it would be quite necessary that the governor should be able\r\nto vouch positive orders for his not calling the assembly, if he\r\nwas not to do it,\" and he adds that, \"with regard to calling the\r\nnew assembly in May, it would require much consideration.\" By the\r\nCharter of this province, which is a Compact between the Crown and\r\nthe People, it is ordained that a General Assembly shall be called\r\non every last Wednesday in May yearly: Did gov. Bernard then think\r\nthat his lordship, to whom in one instance at least, he had\r\nsurrendered the power of the governor of the province, could by\r\nanother order rescind that effectual Right of the Charter? It\r\nwould in truth require much consideration with one, even of his\r\nlordship's peculiar turn of mind, before he would assume an\r\nauthority to put an end to the constitution of the province: He\r\nhad gone far enough already. - The Charter further ordains, that\r\nthe assembly shall be held \"at all such other times as the\r\ngovernor shall think fit.\" Not as lord Hillsborough shall think\r\nfit, for he is not the governor. Could the governor think that the\r\npeople were so stupid as to be satisfied with his vouching -\r\norders for neglecting that which it was his indispensable duty to\r\ndo as governor of the province; and by neglecting which, either\r\nwith or without his lordship's orders, there would be an end to\r\nthe supreme legislative power; the establishing of which, as Mr.\r\nLocke says, is the first and fundamental positive law of the\r\ncommonwealth. The general assembly is constituted by the charter,\r\nthe legislative of the province; having full power and authority\r\nto make all such orders, laws, statutes, &c. not repugnant to the\r\nlaws of England, as they shall judge to be for the good and\r\nwelfare of the province. - \"The first framers of the government,\r\nnot being able by any foresight to prefix so just periods of\r\nreturn and duration to the assemblies of the legislative, in all\r\ntimes to come, that might exactly answer all the emergencies of\r\nthe commonwealth, the best method that could be found, was to\r\ntrust this to the prudence of one, who was always to be present,\r\nand whose business it should be to watch over the commonwealth.\"\r\nHence the charter provides, that the governor who is to reside in\r\nthe province, and who, being always present, must be acquainted\r\nwith the state and exigences of the public affairs, shall have\r\nfull power and authority to adjourn or dissolve the assembly, and\r\ncall a new one from time to time as he shall judge necessary: But\r\nour governors have of late given up this power of judging - to a\r\nminister of state; residing at a thousand leagues distance, and\r\ntherefore utterly unable to determine, if it was lawful for him to\r\ndo it, at what time the necessities of the state might require the\r\nimmediate exertion of legislative power. This ministerial\r\nmanoeuvre, to speak in modern language, which threatens the\r\ndestruction of the constitution, will, it is hoped, be the subject\r\nof national enquiry, when the present confusion in Britain and\r\nAmerica shall, as it must soon, be brought to a happy issue. \"The\r\nlegislative is sacred and unalterable in the hands where the\r\ncommunity has fixed it.\" In this province it is fixed by the\r\ncommunity, in the hands of the Governor, Council and House of\r\nRepresentatives: In their hands therefore, it ought to rest sacred\r\nand unalterable; to be sure as long as the express conditions of\r\nthe compact are fulfilled. - Lord Stafford, and many lords and\r\ngreat men before him, suffered death for attempting to overthrow\r\nthe constitution of the state. - Their crime was called, and I\r\nsupposed justly called, Treason: It surely could not have been\r\ntreason therefore, to have disturbed and resisted them in their\r\nmad attempts, even though they might have produced the orders of a\r\nking - What punishment awaits those who have manifestly attempted\r\nto overthrow the constitution of the American colonies, the time\r\nwhich we hope for, and is hastening on, will determine. If the\r\nvery being of the legislative of this province is for the future\r\nto depend upon the mere will and pleasure of an arbitrary minister\r\n- if he may take it upon him to dictate such measures as he pleases,\r\nand to dissolve them, or which is the same thing, order an obsequious\r\ngovernor to do it, upon their non-compliance with his will and\r\npleasure, surely we have little to boast of in such an assembly. The\r\ncharter may be taken away in tarts as well as in the whole: And it\r\nseems by some later ministerial mandates and measures, as if there was\r\na design to deprive us of our Charter-Rights by degrees. An attempt\r\nupon the whole by one stroke would perhaps be thought too bold an\r\nundertaking. His lordship could not indeed have chosen a more\r\neffectual step to deprive us of the whole benefit of a free\r\nconstitution, than by attempting to controul the debates and\r\ndeterminations of the House of Representatives, which ought forever to\r\nbe free, and suspending the legislative power of the province, for\r\ntheir refusing to obey any mandate, especially when it is not only\r\ncontrary to their judgments and consciences, but, as it appeared to\r\nthem, absurd. It is a pitiful constitution indeed, which so far from\r\nbeing fixed and permanent as it should be - sacred and unalterable in\r\nthe hands of those where the community has placed it, depends entirely\r\nupon the breath of a minister, or of any man: But it is to be feared\r\nfrom this as well as other more recent instances, that there is a\r\ndesign to rase the foundations of the constitutions of these colonies,\r\nand place them upon this precarious and sandy foundation. - I have\r\nseen a letter from the agent of this province to the government here,\r\ndated so long ago as March the 7th, 1750; wherein he says, \"I am\r\nafraid there is at bottom in the minds of some, a fixed design of\r\ngetting a parliamentary sanction of some kind or other, if possible,\r\nto the King's instructions on this occasion;\" which was the redressing\r\nthe inconveniencies proceeding from the paper bills. And in another\r\nletter of the 12th of April following, he writes, \"Since my last, I\r\nhave found too great reason to confirm my apprehensions, that some\r\npersons of consequence here, are determined, if possible, to put the\r\nfuture use of the credit of the several governments of New England,\r\nwholly under the power of an instruction; and what tendency that\r\nmay have to introduce the King's instructions into the government\r\nof the other colonies, in other instances, I need not observe\r\nThis design seems to be conducted with great art.\" The fears of\r\nthat watchful agent, there is reason to apprehend, from the\r\nperfect good understanding that now exists between the ruling men\r\nin the American department, on both sides the atlantic, may very\r\nsoon be far from appearing groundless. Instructions have of late\r\nbeen so frequent, and in every instance so punctiliously obeyed,\r\nthat there is reason to fear, unless greater attention is had to\r\nthem, they soon will be established as rules of administration, not\r\nonly to governors as servants of the crown, but to legislatures. The\r\nenforcing them seems to be conducted with equal art on this side of\r\nthe water at present, to that with which the original design of\r\nintroducing them was conducted on the other side, when that agent\r\nwrote. They may soon therefore be regarded as fixed laws in the\r\ncolonies, even without the sanction or intervention of parliament\r\nPrincipiis obsta, is a maxim worth regarding in politics as well as\r\nmorals, and it is more especially to be observed, when those who are\r\nthe most assiduous in their endeavours to alter the civil\r\nConstitution, are not less so in persuading us to go to sleep and\r\ndream that we are in a state of perfect security. - What benefit\r\nis it to us to have a governor residing in the province, invested\r\nwith certain powers of judging -, and acting according to his own\r\njudgment, for the good of the people, if he submit to be made a\r\nman of wire, & for the sake of preserving the emolument of a\r\ngovernor, with the name only, is turned this way or that, as the\r\nminister directs, without any judgment of his own? And of what use\r\ncan a legislative be to us, without the free exercise of the\r\npowers of legislation? Liable to be thrown out of existence for\r\nnot acting in conformity to the will of another? Can there be any\r\nmaterial difference between such a legislative and none at all?\r\nThe original constitution of this province, the charter, required\r\nthe convening of a new general assembly in May: The public\r\nexigencies might have required it sooner: But governor Bernard was\r\ndetermined in neither of these cases to convene an assembly, if he\r\ncould but vouch the positive orders of the minister, who had no\r\nright or legal authority at all to interpose in the matter. \"The\r\nusing of force upon the people without authority, and contrary to\r\nthe trust reposed in him that does so, is a state of war with the\r\npeople;\" This is the judgment of one of the greatest men that ever\r\nwrote. \"If the executive power, being possessed of the power of\r\nthe commonwealth, shall make use of that force to hinder the\r\nmeeting and acting of the legislative, when the original\r\nconstitution or the public exigencies shall require it, the people\r\nhave a right to reinstate their legislative in the exercise of\r\ntheir power: For having erected a legislative, with an intent they\r\nshould exercise the power of making laws, either at certain set\r\ntimes or when there is need of it, if they are hindered by any\r\nforce from what is so necessary to the society, and wherein the\r\nsafety and preservation of the people consists, they have a right\r\nto remove it by force.\" From this instance of the dissolution of\r\nthe assembly of this province, as well as that of the suspension\r\nof the legislative of New York, for refusing to execute an act of\r\nparliament, requiring them to give and grant away their own and\r\ntheir constituents money for the support of a standing army,\r\nposterity will form a judgment of the temper of the British\r\nadministration at that time: Whether a different disposition has\r\nsince prevailed, will appear from the measures they have taken in\r\ngeneral; and particularly from the answers to the addresses,\r\npetitions and remonstrances which we have lately seen. One would\r\nhave thought that the American legislative assemblies had become\r\ntoo harmless bodies to have been the object of ministerial rage,\r\nsince the passing of acts of parliament for the sole purpose of\r\nraising revenues at the expence of the colonists, without their\r\nconsent, and for appropriating those revenues as they should think\r\nproper. The most essential Rights of American legislation, are\r\nthose of raising and applying their own monies for the support of\r\ntheir own government, and for their own defence: By the late\r\nrevenue acts, these rights are in effect superseded; the\r\nparliament having already granted, such sums as they please, out\r\nof the purses of the colonists, for the same purposes. Thus the\r\nshadow of legislation only remains to them: Their importance is at\r\nan end. They may indeed, as the Pennsylvania farmer observes,\r\nwhose works I wish every American would read over again, \"They may\r\nperhaps be allowed to make laws for yoking of hogs or pounding of\r\nstray cattle: Their influence will hardly be permitted to extend\r\nso high as the keeping roads in repair; as that business may more\r\nproperly be executed by those who receive the public cash.\" Their\r\nsubstantial rights and powers, lord Hillsborough himself should know,\r\nare as really annihilated by these acts, as they would be, if they\r\nwere deprived of all existence. \"Upon what occasion, says that elegant\r\nwriter, will the crown ever call our assemblies together, when, the\r\ncharges of the administration of justice, the support of civil\r\ngovernment, and the expences of protecting, defending and securing us,\r\nare provided for\" by the parliament? \"Some few of them may meet of\r\ntheir own accord, by virtue of their several charters: But what will\r\nthey have to do when they are met? To what shadows will they be\r\nreduced? The men, whose deliberations heretofore, had an influence on\r\nevery matter relating to the liberty and happiness of themselves and\r\ntheir constituents, and whose authority in domestic affairs at least,\r\nmight well be compared to that of Roman senators, will find their\r\ndeterminations to be of no more consequence than that of constables.\"\r\n- And this will not be the utmost extent of our misery and infamy\r\n\r\nCANDIDUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ARTHUR LEE.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library; a text, with variations, is\r\nin R. H. Lee, Life of Arthur Lee, vol. ii., pp. 177-183.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON Sept 27 1771\r\n\r\nSIR\r\n\r\nI am greatly indebted to you for your several Letters of [the 10th\r\nand 14th of June].\r\n\r\nTo let you know that I am far from being inattentive to the favors\r\nyou have done me I inclose you a Letter I wrote you some time past,\r\nbut was prevented putting it in the Bag by an Accident. I have since\r\nbeen confind to my house by Sickness & by a late Excursion into the\r\nCountry I have fully recoverd my Health.\r\n\r\nI take particular Notice of the Reasons you assign for a whole\r\nSession of parliamt being spent without one offensive Measure to\r\nAmerica. You account for our being flatterd that all Designs against\r\nthe Charter of the Colony are laid aside, in a manner perfectly\r\ncorresponding with the Sentiments I had preconceivd of it. The\r\nopinion you have formd of the ruling men on both sides the Atlantick,\r\nis exactly mine and as I have the most unfavorable Idea of the Heads\r\nor the Hearts of the present Administration, I cannot hope for much\r\nGood from the Services of any man who can submit to be dependent on\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nI was pleasd with the petition & remonstrance of the City of London -\r\nbut are not the Ministry lost to all Sensibility to the peoples\r\nComplaints, & like the Egyptian Tyrant, do they not harden their\r\nHearts against their repeated Demands for a redress of Grievances.\r\nDoes it not fully appear not only that they neither fear God nor\r\nregard Man, but that they are not even to be wearied, as one of their\r\nancient predecessors was, by frequent Applications. What do you\r\nconceive to be the Step next to be taken by an abused people? For\r\nanother must be taken either by the ministry or the people or in my\r\nopinion the nation will fall into that ruin of which they seem to me\r\nto be now at the very precipice. May God afford them that Prudence,\r\nStrength & fortitude by which they may be animated to maintain their\r\nown Liberties at all Events. By your last letter you appear to resolve\r\nwell; if ever the Spirit of impeaching should rise in Britain. But how\r\nis it possible such a Spirit should rise. In all former Struggles the\r\nHouse of Commons has naturally taken Sides with the people against\r\noppressing Ministers & Favorites. But whether that is the Case at\r\npresent or not, is no secret to the World. We have indeed heard little\r\nof the Business of impeaching since the Revolution. A corrupt\r\nministerial Influence has been gradually & too insensibly increasing\r\nfrom that OEra, & is at length become so powerful (for which I think\r\nthe Nation is particularly beholden to Sir R. Walpole) as to render it\r\nimpracticable to have even one capital Object of the peoples just\r\nVengeance impeachd. The proposals you were so kind as [to] favor me\r\nwith, I cannot but highly approve of. I communicated them to two or\r\nthree intimate & judicious friends who equally approvd of them. But\r\nthey cannot be carried into Execution till the present parliamt is at\r\nan End. And if it is not to be dissolvd before the End of its\r\nseptennial Duration, is it not to be feard that before its Expiration\r\nthere will be an End of Liberty. If I mistake not there is an Act of\r\nparliamt whereby the Seats of placemen and pensioners in the House of\r\nCommons (who were not such at the time of their Election) shall be\r\nvacated, & their Electors have a right to the Choice of another if\r\nthey see proper. Perhaps there never was a time when the Advantages of\r\nthis Law were more apparent. Would it not then be doing the most\r\nimportant Service to the Cause of Liberty if the Gentlemen of the Bill\r\nof Rights, who I pray God may be united in their Councils, would exert\r\ntheir utmost Influence to prevail upon the Constituents of such rotten\r\nMembers to claim that privilege & make a good Use of it? If there is\r\nany Virtue among the people, I should think this might easily be done.\r\nIf it be impracticable, I fear another general Election wd only serve\r\nto convince all of what many are apprehensive, that there is a total\r\nDepravation of principles & manners in the Nation, or in other Words\r\nthat it is already irrecoverably undone.\r\n\r\nWe are in a State of perfect Despotism. Our Governmt is essentially\r\nalterd. Instead of having a Gov exercising Authority within the Rules\r\n& Circumscription of the Charter which is the Compact between the King\r\n& the People, & dependent upon the people for his Support, we have a\r\nMan with the Name of a Governor only. He is indeed commissiond by the\r\nKing, but under the Controul of the Minister, to whose Instrucctions\r\nhe yields an unlimitted Obedience, while he is subsisted with the\r\nMoney of that very people who are thus governd, by virtue of an\r\nAssumd Authority of the British Parliament to oblige them to grant\r\nhim such an annual Stipend as the King shall order. Can you tell me\r\nwho is Governor of this province? Surely not Hutchinson, for I cannot\r\nconceive that he exercises the power of judging vested in him by the\r\nConstitution, in one Act of Govt which appears to him to be\r\nimportant. The Govt is shifted into the Hands of the Earl of\r\nHillsborough whose sole Councellor is the Nettleham Baronet. Upon\r\nthis Governor aided by the Advice of this Councellor depends the time\r\n& place of the Sitting of the legislative Assembly or whether it\r\nshall sit at all. If they are allowd to sit, they are to be dictated\r\nby this duumvirate, thro the Instrumentality of a third, & may be\r\nthrown out of Existence for failing in one point to conform to their\r\nsovereign pleasure, a Legislative to be sure worthy to be boasted of\r\nby a free people. If our nominal Governor by all the Arts of\r\nperswasion, can prevail upon us to be easy under such a Mode of\r\nGovernment, he will do a singular piece of Service to his Lordship,\r\nas it will save him the trouble of geting our Charter vacated by the\r\nformal Decision of parliamt & the tedious process of Law.\r\n\r\nThe Grievances of Britain & the Colonies as you observe spring from\r\nthe same root of Bitterness & are of the same pernicious Growth. The\r\nUnion of Britain & the Colonies is therefore by all means to be\r\ncultivated. If in every Colony Societies should be formd out of the\r\nmost respectable Inhabitants, similar to that of the Bill of Rights,\r\nwho should once in the year meet by their Deputies, and correspond\r\nwith such a Society in London, would it not effectually promote such\r\nan Union? And if conducted with a proper spirit, would it not afford\r\nreason for the Enemies of our common Liberty, however great, to\r\ntremble. This is a sudden Thought & drops undigested from my pen. It\r\nwould be an arduous Task for any man to attempt to awaken a\r\nsufficient Number in the Colonies to so grand an Undertaking. Nothing\r\nhowever should be despaird of.\r\n\r\nIf it should ever become a practicable thing to impeach a corrupt\r\nAdministration I hope the Minister who advisd to the introducing\r\narbitrary power into America will not be overlookd. Such a Victim I\r\nimagine will make a figure equal to Lord Strafford in the Reign of\r\nCharles, or de le Pole & others in former times. \"The Conduct of the\r\nJudges touching 'Juries\" appears to be alarming on both sides of the,\r\nWater & ought to be strictly enquired into. And are they not\r\nestablishing the civil Law which Mr Blackstone says is only permitted\r\nin England to the prejudice of the Common Law, the Consequence of\r\nwhich will prove fatal to the happy Constitution. I observe that one\r\nof your proposals is that a Law may be made \"subjecting each Candidate\r\nto an Oath against having used Bribery\" to obtain his Election. Would\r\nthere not be a danger that a Law by which a Candidate may purge\r\nhimself by his Oath would exclude some other more certain Evidence\r\nthan the Oath of one who has already prostituted his Conscience for a\r\nSeat than his own Declaration of his Innocence even upon Oath? I am of\r\nopinion that He who can be so sordid as to gain an Election by Bribery\r\nor any other illegal means, must be lost to all such feelings as those\r\nof Honor or Conscience or the Obligation of an Oath. With Regard the\r\nGrievances of the Americans it must be owned that the Violation of\r\nthe essential Right of taxing themselves is a Capital one. This Right\r\nis founded in Nature. It is unalienable & therefore it belongs to us\r\nexclusively. The least Infringement on it is Sacrilege. But there\r\nare other Methods taken by Lord Hillsbro & punctually put into\r\nExecution by Govr Hutchinson, which in my Opinion would give a mortal\r\nStab to Our essential Rights, if the Parliament had not by their\r\ndeclaratory Act claimd Authority to make use of our money to\r\nestablish a standing army over us & an host of pensioners and\r\nplacemen civil & ecclesiastical, which are as terrible as an Army of\r\nSoldiers. And if the Commons of this province cannot impeach, we have\r\nnothing to rely upon but the Interposition of our friends in Britain,\r\nor the ultima Ratio.\r\n\r\nInclosd you have a Copy of the protests of divers patriotick\r\nClergymen in Virginia against an Episcopate in America. It is part of\r\nthe plan the design of which is to secure a ministerial Influence in\r\nAmerica, which in all Reason is full strong enough without the Aid of\r\nthe Clergy. The Junction of the Cannon & the feudal Law you know has\r\nbeen fatal to the Liberties of Mankind. The Design of the first\r\nSettlers of New England in particular was to settle a plan of govt\r\nupon the true principles of Liberty in which the Clergy should have\r\nno Authority. It is no Wonder then that we should be alarmd at the\r\nDesigns of establishing such a power. It is a singular pleasure to us\r\nthat the Colony of Virginia tho episcopalian should appear against it\r\nas you will see by the Vote of thanks of the House of Burgesses to\r\nthe protesting Gentlemen; they declare their protest to be \"a wise &\r\nwell timed opposition.\" I wish it could be publishd in London. I had\r\nthe pleasure of knowing Mr Hewet who was in this Town about two years\r\nago in Company with Mr Eyre of Northhampton County, in Virginia, who\r\nis a member of the House of Burgesses. I did not then know that Mr\r\nHewet was a Clergyman.\r\n\r\nI fear I have tired your patience & conclude by assuring you that I\r\nam in strict Truth\r\nSir Your friend & hume servt\r\n\r\nP.S.-The Bearer hereof is William Story Esqr formerly of this Town,\r\nbut now of Ipswich a Town about 30 Miles East. He was Deputy Register\r\nin the Court of Vice Admiraltry before & at the time of the Stamp Act\r\n& would then have given up the Place as he declared but his Friends\r\nadvisd him against it - he sufferd the Resentment of the people on the\r\n26 of August 1765, together with Lt Govr Hutchinson & others for which\r\nhe was recompencd by the Genl Assembly, as he declares in part only.\r\nHe tells me that his Design in going home is to settle an Affair of\r\nhis own relating to the Admiraltry Court, in which the Commissioners\r\nof the Customs as he says declare it is out of their power to do him\r\nJustice. One would think it was never in their Power or Inclination to\r\ndo any man Justice. Mr Story has always professd himself a Friend to\r\nLiberty for many years past. I tell him that I make no doubt but you\r\nwill befriend him as far as shall be in your power in obtaining\r\nJustice, in which you will very much oblige,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE SIGNED \"CANDIDUS.\"\r\n\r\n[Boston Gazette, September 30, 1771.]\r\n\r\nMessieurs EDES & GILL,\r\n\r\nA General Assembly, when actuated with a becoming spirit of public\r\nliberty against the attacks of arbitrary and despotic ministers,\r\nappeared to be as disgustful to Gov. Bernard, as parliaments were to\r\nJames the first; with whom it was even an aphorism that the lords and\r\ncommons were two bad co-partners with a monarch: Having got rid of\r\nsuch a troublesome assembly at least for one year, he was more at\r\nleisure, in conjunction with the commissioners of the customs and his\r\nother confederates, to attend to the plan which their hearts had been\r\nlong set upon, of introducing into the province a military power for\r\ntheir aid. -Accordingly every little occurrence, which a man of sense\r\nwho had no political designs in view would not have thought worth his\r\nnotice such as frequently happen in the most orderly cities, was\r\ngathered up with uncommon industry and made the subject of\r\nrepresentation to the ministry - He even descended so low as to give\r\nlord Hillsborough a detail of the diversion of a few boys in the\r\nstreet with a drum, which at no time is unusual in populous places,\r\nand pictured it to his lordship, who, it seems gave it its full\r\nweight, as a prelude to a designed insurrection, in which \"persons of\r\nall kinds, sexes and ages,\" were to bear their part - The common\r\namusements of children were construed rebellion, and his lordship had\r\nminute accounts of them sent to him by this busy journalist, as\r\ngrounds upon which he might form measures of administration. But his\r\nletters, together with those of general Gage and commodore Hood, and\r\nthe memorials, &c. of the commissioners of the customs, have already\r\nbeen sufficiently animadverted upon-\" No one, says the town of\r\nBoston, in a pamphlet, entitled, An appeal to the World,2 can read\r\nthem without being astonished at seeing a person in so important a\r\ndepartment as governor Bernard sustained, descending in his letters\r\nto a minister of state to such trifling circumstances and such\r\nslanderous chit-chat: Boasting as he does in one of them of his\r\nover-reaching those with whom he was transacting publick business;\r\nand in order to prejudice the most respectable bodies, meanly\r\nfilching from individuals belonging to those bodies, what had been\r\ndrop'd in the course of business or debate: Journalizing every idle\r\nreport bro't to him, and in short acting the part of a pimp rather\r\nthan a governor.\" Sufficient however were they finally to prevail\r\nupon administration, which had before been full ready eno' to employ\r\nthe military force in England, to order four regiments and part of a\r\nfifth, for the preservation of the peace in the town of Boston. The\r\nonly disorders in the town that could give any colouring to measures\r\nso severe, and not more severe than unjustifiable by the constitution,\r\nhappened on the 18th of March and 10th of June, 1768 - The first was\r\nnothing more than the parading of the lower sort of people thro' the\r\nstreets at the close of an anniversary festivity; when no injury was\r\noffered to any person whatever, no harm was done, nor did even Governor\r\nBernard himself pretend that any was intended. General Gage, in a\r\nletter to Lord Hillsborough, mentioned this disorder as \"trifling.\"\r\nThe other was occasioned by the unprecedented and unlawful manner of\r\nseizing a vessel by the collector and comptroller - His Majesty's\r\nCouncil after full enquiry into this disorder and the cause of it,\r\ndeclared, that it \"was occasioned by the making a seizure (in a\r\nmanner unprecedented) in the town of Boston on the 10th of June,1 a\r\nlittle before sun-set, when a vessel was seized by the officers of\r\nthe customs; and immediately after, upon a signal given by one of\r\nsaid officers, in consequence of a preconcerted plan, several armed\r\nboats from the Romney man-of-war took possession of her.\" - The\r\nofficers who made the seizure were insulted, some of the windows of\r\ntheir dwelling houses were broke, and other disorders were committed\r\n- But the council further declared, that it was \"highly probable that\r\nno such disorders would have been committed if the vessel had not\r\nbeen with an armed force and with many circumstances of insults &\r\nthreats carried away from the wharf.\" They also say, that the\r\ndisorder \"seemed to spring wholly from the persons who complained of\r\nit,\" and that it \"was probable that an uproar was hoped for, and\r\nintended to be occasioned by the manner of proceeding in making the\r\nseizure.\" This representation of the matter was made by those very\r\ngentlemen, of whom governor Bernard not above 3 or 4 months before,\r\nhad given this ample testimony to Lord Hillsborough; that \"they had\r\nshown great attention to the support of government,\" and \"upon many\r\noccasions a resolution and steadiness in promoting his Majesty's\r\nservice, which would have done honor to his Majesty's appointment, if\r\nthey had held their places under it:\" And to whom he about the same\r\ntime very warmly returned his thanks, \"for their steady, uniform and\r\npatriotic conduct, which had shown them impressed with a full\r\nsense of their duty both to their king & their country.\" A\r\nrepresentation of matters of fact, made by gentlemen whom governor\r\nBernard had so highly applauded for their attention to the support of\r\ngovernment, and resolution and steadiness in promoting his majesty's\r\nservice, must surely meet with full credit with the friends of\r\ngovernment; and induce a conclusion, even in their minds, that if\r\nthere was a necessity of troops in the town of Boston to keep the\r\npeace, it arose not from the \"madness of the people,\" (a decent\r\nexpression of General Gage) but altogether from the extravagance\r\nof the servants of the crown; who after a preconcerted plan, according\r\nto the account given by the council, hoped for, and intended that an\r\nuproar should be occasion'd, by the manner of their proceeding with\r\nan armed force, and many circumstances of insult and threats in making\r\na seizure. -This disturbance, after a few hours, wholly subsided, thro'\r\nthe interposition of the inhabitants of the town, & no great mischief\r\nwas done; yet the most aggravated accounts were given of it by the Cabal,\r\nto answer their own purposes. The Romney ship of war, had before been\r\nordered by commodore Hood to this place, in consequence of\r\ninformation sent to him of a factious and turbulent spirit among the\r\npeople. The captain thought it his duty to acquaint the commodore of\r\nthis fresh disturbance; and the Beaver sloop, being then in the\r\nharbour, and preparing for her station at Philadelphia, was remanded\r\nback to Halifax for that purpose, and with such speed as to be\r\nobliged to leave part of her provisions behind - Large packets were\r\nsent by this vessel to the commodore, and others for England, where\r\nit was proposed by the cabal she should be immediately dispatched\r\nfrom Halifax. The comptroller of the customs embark'd on board the\r\nsame sloop very privately, by whom letters in abundance were sent to\r\nLondon. In these letters a number of gentlemen, who were called the\r\nleaders of the faction, were proscribed. Some of the cabal could not\r\nconceal their designs; for it was even then given out by them, that\r\ntroops would probably soon arrive from Halifax, and that two\r\nregiments of Irish troops were to be sent to this town; all which\r\naccordingly took place in about four months afterwards, being the\r\ntime in which they might have been expected by orders of the ministry\r\nin consequence of these letters. Indeed we have since been made\r\ncertain by a publication of their own letters, that they had\r\nearnestly sollicited the sending of troops about this time. The\r\ncommissioners of the customs in a letter to the lords of the\r\ntreasury, acquainted that board \"that there had been a long concerted\r\nand extensive plan of resistance to the authority of Great Britain,\r\nand that the seizure had hastened the people to the commission of\r\nactual violence sooner than was intended\" and further, \"that nothing\r\nbut the exertion of military power would prevent an open revolt in\r\nthis town, which would probably spread throughout the provinces.\" The\r\ncollector and comptroller in their letters upon this occasion to the\r\ncommissioners, which was laid before administration tell their\r\nhonors, \"that it appeared evident to them that a plan of insurrection\r\nof a very dangerous and extensive nature had long been in\r\nagitation, & now brought nearly to a crisis.\" But it is needless to\r\nrepeat the many exaggerated accounts given by the governor and his\r\nconfederates, of this occurrence, which on the part of the people was\r\naltogether unexpected; and as the Council observed, \"seem'd to have\r\nsprang wholly from the persons who complained of it.\" - To crown all,\r\nthe Commissioners pretended that \"they had reason to expect further\r\nviolences,\" and fled, Bernard says in a letter to lord Hillsborough,\r\n\"were driven\" to Castle William; where they represented to the lords\r\nof the treasury that the \"protection afforded them by Commodore Hood,\r\nviz, the Romney and one or two sloops of war, was the most\r\nseasonable, as without it they should not have considered themselves\r\n(even there) in safety, nor his Majesty's Castle secured from falling\r\ninto the hands of the people,\" and \"that it was impossible for them\r\nto set foot in Boston, until there were two or three regiments in the\r\ntown, to restore and support government.\" - However true it may be,\r\nthat the Commissioners had rendered themselves the objects of the\r\npublick resentment, which their letters and memorials have had no\r\ntendency to abate, they never had been, to use an expression of Gov.\r\nBernard, the objects of popular fury; not the least injury had ever\r\nbeen offer'd to their persons or property. They had landed without\r\nopposition, and had lived in the town many months, if despis'd and\r\nhated, yet unmolested: For this we have the testimony of his\r\nMajesty's Council; \"They were not, say they, oblig'd to quit the town\r\n- it was a voluntary act of their own - there never had been any\r\ninsult offer'd Them - and when they were at the Castle there was\r\nno occasion for men of war to protect them.\" And even after their\r\nvoluntary flight, they often made excursions upon the main, for the\r\npurpose of amusement and recreation, for which, having quitted the\r\nsevere exercises of their employment in the town, they now had\r\nsufficient leisure: There, they might easily have been insulted if\r\nthere had been any such disposition in the people. It has long been\r\nevident that all this pretended apprehension of danger, and their\r\nflight first to the Romney ship of war, and then to the castle for\r\nprotection, was intended to cooperate with & confirm the letters and\r\nmemorials sent home, and to facilitate the prosecution of their design.\r\nSuch were the methods us'd by a restless set of men, to hold up this\r\ntown and province, to the nation and to the world, in a false and\r\nodious light. It was therefore peculiarly incumbent upon all, and those\r\npersons especially, who were entrusted by the publick, to be vigilant\r\nfor it, at a time when they who were seeking its ruin, were\r\nremarkably attentive to and active in prosecuting their plans. And\r\ncan any one say there is reason to think that a minister of the\r\ntemper of Lord H---h, perpetually acted upon by the implacable hatred\r\nof Bernard, has yet abandon'd, or is likely to abandon, his favorite\r\nsystem, while there is ONE left on this side the water who is ready\r\nto put it in execution? - No - The disputes with the court of Spain\r\nand the city of London during the late session of parliament, may\r\nhave prov'd so embarrassing to A---n as to have caus'd a suspension\r\nof the execution of it for a while; but to trust that it is therefore\r\nwholly laid aside, is a degree of credulity and infatuation, which I\r\nhope will never be impos'd by any man on this country. Great pains we\r\nknow are taken to perswade and assure us, that as long as we continue\r\nquiet, nothing will be done to our prejudice: But let us beware of\r\nthese soothing arts. - Has anything been done for our relief? - Has\r\nany one grievance which we have complained of been redressed? On the\r\ncontrary, are not our just causes of complaint and remonstrance daily\r\nincreasing, at a time when we were flattered that a change of men\r\nwould produce a change of measures? Have our petitions for the\r\nredress of grievances ever been answered or even listened to? If not,\r\nwhat can be intended by all the fair promises made to us by tools and\r\nsycophants, but to lull us into that quietude and sleep by which\r\nslavery is always preceeded. - While treachery and imposition is the\r\nfort of any man, let us remember, there is always most danger when\r\nhis professions are warmest.\r\n\r\nCANDIDUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1See Vol. I., page 396.\r\n2 See Vol. I., page 245.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ARTHUR LEE.\r\n\r\n[R.

Hutchinson, which may possibly recommend him for some place by\r\nway of compensation for his joint sufferings with the governor. I do\r\nnot think it possible for any man to receive his lordship's favour,\r\nwithout purchasing it by having done or promising to do some kind of\r\njobs. If Mr. Story should form connexions with administration upon\r\nany principles inconsistent with those of a friend to liberty, he\r\nwill then appear to be a different character from that which I\r\nrecommended to your friendship. I mention this for your caution, and\r\nin confidence; and am with great regard sir, your humble servant,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE SIGNED \"CANDIDUS.\"\r\n\r\n[Boston Gazette, October 7, 1771.]\r\n\r\nMessieurs EDES & GILL,\r\nInstead of voted Aid,\r\n\r\n\"Th' illegal imposition followed harsh\r\nWith Execration given, or ruthless squeez'd\r\nFrom an insulted People.\"\r\nTHOMPSON.\r\n\r\nI Think it necessary the publick should be inform'd, that his\r\nExcellency Thomas Hutchinson, Esq; Governor of this Province, has\r\nlately receiv'd, a warrant from the Lords of the Treasury in England,\r\nfor the Sum of Twenty-two Hundred and fifty Pounds Sterling for his\r\nServices for one year and a half, being at the rate of Fifteen\r\nHundred Sterling or Two Thousand L. M. per Ann. - The payment is to\r\nbe made out of the Commissioners Chest; wherein are reposited the\r\nTreasures that are daily collected, tho' perhaps insensibly, from the\r\nEarnings and Industry of the honest Yeomen, Merchants and Tradesmen,\r\nof this continent, against their Consent; and if his friends speak the\r\ntruth, against his own private judgment. - This treasure is to be\r\nappropriated according to the act of parliament so justly and loudly\r\ncomplain'd of by Americans, for the support of civil government, the\r\npayment of the charges of the administration of justice, and the\r\ndefence of the colonies: And it may hereafter be made use of, for the\r\nsupport of standing armies and ships of war; episcopates & their\r\nnumerous ecclesiastical retinue; pensioners, placemen and other\r\njobbers, for an abandon'd and shameless ministry; hirelings, pimps,\r\nparasites, panders, prostitutes and whores - His Excellency had\r\nrepeatedly refused to accept the usual Salary out of the treasury of\r\nthis province; which leads us to think that his eminent patron the\r\nEarl of Hillsborough, or his most respected friend Sir Francis\r\nBernard, who is ever at his Lordship's elbow, had given him certain\r\ninformation that this honorable stipend would be allow'd to him -\r\nWhether he tho't the generous grant of a thousand sterling, annually\r\nmade to his predecessors, and offer'd to him, by the assembly, not\r\nadequate to his important services to the province in supporting and\r\nvindicating its charter and constitutional rights and liberties; or\r\nwhether he was forbid by instruction from his Lordship to receive it,\r\nwhich is probable from his own words, \"I could not consistent with my\r\nduty to the King\"; or lastly, and which is still more probable,\r\nWhether he was ambitious of being, beyond any of his predecessors, a\r\nGovernor independent of the free grants of the assembly, which is no\r\ndoubt reconcileable with his Excellency's idea of a constitutional\r\ngovernor of a free people, are matters problematical. - Adulating\r\nPriestlings and others, who have sounded his high praises in the\r\nnews-papers, and in the church of God, as well as in other solemn\r\nassemblies, may perhaps echo the fallacious reasoning from one of his\r\npublick speeches, \"The people will not blame (him) for being willing\r\nto avoid burdening them with his support, by the increase of the tax\r\nupon their polls and estates,\" since it is now \"provided for another\r\nway.\" In all ages the supercilious part of the clergy have adored the\r\nGreat Man, and shown a thorough contempt of the understanding of the\r\npeople. But the people, and a great part, I hope, of the clergy of\r\nthis enlightened country, have understanding enough to know, that a\r\nGovernor independent of the people for his support, as well as his\r\npolitical Being, is in fact, a MASTER; and may be, and probably, such\r\nis the nature of uncontroulable power, soon will be a TYRANT. It will\r\nbe recorded by the faithful historian, for the information of\r\nposterity, that the first American Pensioner - the first independent\r\nGovernor of this province, was, not a stranger, but one \"born and\r\neducated\" in it - Not an ANDROSS or a RANDOLPH; but that cordial\r\nfriend to our civil constitution -that main Pillar of the Religion\r\nand the Learning of this country; the Man, upon whom she has, (I will\r\nnot say wantonly) heaped all the Honors she had to bestow -\r\nHUTCHINSON!! - We are told that the Justices of the Superior Court\r\nare also to receive fixed salaries out of this American revenue! -\r\n\"Is it possible to form an idea of slavery, more compleat, more\r\nmiserable, more disgraceful, than that of a people, where justice is\r\nadminister'd, government exercis'd, and a standing army maintain'd, at\r\nthe expence of the people, and yet without the least dependence upon\r\nthem? If we can find no relief from this infamous situation\" - I\r\nrepeat it, \"If we can find no relief from this infamous situation \",\r\nlet the ministry who have stripped us of our property and liberty,\r\ndeprive us of our understanding too; that unconscious of what we have\r\nbeen or are, and ungoaded by tormenting reflections, we may tamely bow\r\ndown our necks, with all the stupid serenity of servitude, to any\r\ndrudgery which our lords & masters may please to command\" - I appeal\r\nto the common sense of mankind. To what a state of misery and infamy\r\nmust a people be reduced! To have a governor by the sole\r\nappointment of the crown, under the absolute controul of a weak and\r\narbitrary minister, to whose dictates he is to yield an unlimited\r\nobedience, or forfeit his political existence while he is to be\r\nsupported at the expence of the people, by virtue of an authority\r\nclaimed by strangers, to oblige them to contribute for him such an\r\nannual stipend, however unbounded, as the crown shall be advised to\r\norder! If this be not a state of despotism, what is? Could such a\r\ngovernor, by all the arts of persuasion, prevail upon a people to be\r\nquiet and contented under such a mode of government, his noble patron\r\nmight spare himself the trouble of getting their Charter vacated by a\r\nformal decision of parliament, or in the tedious process of law -\r\nWhenever the relentless enemies of America shall have compleated their\r\nsystem, which they are still, though more silently pursuing, by subtle\r\narts, deep dissimulation, and manners calculated to deceive, our\r\ncondition will then be more humiliating and miserable, and perhaps\r\nmore inextricable too, than that of the people of England in the\r\ninfamous reigns of the Stuarts, which blacken the pages of history;\r\nwhen,\r\n\r\n\"Oppression stalk'd at large and pour'd abroad\r\nHer unrelenting Train; Informers - Spies -\r\nHateful Projectors of aggrieving Schemes\r\nTo sell the starving many to the few,\r\nAnd drain a thousand Ways th' exhausted Land...\r\nAnd on the venal Bench\r\nInstead of Justice, Party held the Scale,\r\nAnd Violence the Sword.\"\r\n\r\nYour's,\r\nCANDIDUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE SIGNED \"CANDIDUS.\"\r\n\r\n[Boston Gazette, October 14, 1771.]\r\n\r\nMessieurs EDES & GILL,\r\n\r\n\"Ambition saw that stooping Rome could bear\r\nA MASTER, nor had Virtue to be free.\"\r\n\r\nI Believe that no people ever yet groaned under the heavy yoke of\r\nslavery, but when they deserv'd it. This may be called a severe\r\ncensure upon by far the greatest part of the nations in the world who\r\nare involv'd in the misery of servitude: But however they may be\r\nthought by some to deserve commiseration, the censure is just.\r\nZuinglius, one of the first reformers, in his friendly admonition to\r\nthe republic of the Switzers, discourses much of his countrymens\r\nthrowing off the yoke: He says, that they who lie under oppression\r\ndeserve what they suffer, and a great more; and he bids them perish\r\nwith their oppressors. The truth is, All might be free if they valued\r\nfreedom, and defended it as they ought. Is it possible that millions\r\ncould be enslaved by a few, which is a notorious fact, if all\r\npossessed the independent spirit of Brutus, who to his immortal\r\nhonor, expelled the proud Tyrant of Rome, and his \"royal and\r\nrebellious race?\" If therefore a people will not be free; if they\r\nhave not virtue enough to maintain their liberty against a\r\npresumptuous invader, they deserve no pity, and are to be treated\r\nwith contempt and ignominy. Had not Caesar seen that Rome was ready\r\nto stoop, he would not have dared to make himself the master of that\r\nonce brave people. He was indeed, as a great writer observes, a\r\nsmooth and subtle tyrant, who led them gently into slavery; \"and on\r\nhis brow, 'ore daring vice deluding virtue smil'd\". By pretending to\r\nbe the peoples greatest friend, he gain'd the ascendency over them:\r\nBy beguiling arts, hypocrisy and flattery, which are even more fatal\r\nthan the sword, he obtain'd that supreme power which his ambitious\r\nsoul had long thirsted for: The people were finally prevail'd upon to\r\nconsent to their own ruin: By the force of perswasion, or rather by\r\ncajoling arts and tricks always made use of by men who have ambitious\r\nviews, they enacted their Lex Regia: whereby Quod placuit principi\r\nlegis habuit vigorem; that is, the Will and pleasure of the Prince\r\nhad the force of law. His minions had taken infinite pains to paint\r\nto their imaginations the god-like virtues of Caesar: They first\r\npersuaded them to believe that he was a deity, and then to sacrifice\r\nto him those Rights and Liberties which their ancestors had so long\r\nmaintained, with unexampled bravery, and with blood & treasure. By\r\nthis act they fixed a precedent fatal to all posterity: The Roman\r\npeople afterwards, influenced no doubt by this pernicious example,\r\nrenew'd it to his successors, not at the end of every ten years, but\r\nfor life. They transfer'd all their right and power to Charles the\r\nGreat: In eum transtulit omne suum jus et poteslatem. Thus, they\r\nvoluntarily and ignominiously surrendered their own liberty, and\r\nexchanged a free constitution for a TYRANNY!\r\n\r\nIt is not my design at present to form the comparison between the\r\nstate of this country now, and that of the Roman Empire in those\r\ndregs of time; or between the disposition of Caesar, and that of ---;\r\nThe comparison, I confess, would not in all parts hold good: The\r\nTyrant of Rome, to do him justice, had learning, courage, and great\r\nabilities. It behoves us however to awake and advert to the danger we\r\nare in. The Tragedy of American Freedom, it is to be feared is nearly\r\ncompleated: A Tyranny seems to be at the very door. It is to little\r\npurpose then to go about cooly to rehearse the gradual steps that\r\nhave been taken, the means that have been used, and the instruments\r\nemployed, to encompass the ruin of the public liberty: We know them\r\nand we detest them. But what will this avail, if we have not courage\r\nand resolution to prevent the completion of their system?\r\n\r\nOur enemies would fain have us lie down on the bed of sloth and\r\nsecurity, and persuade ourselves that there is no danger They are\r\ndaily administering the opiate with multiplied arts and delusions,\r\nand I am sorry to observe, that the gilded pill is so alluring to\r\nsome who call themselves the friends of Liberty. But is there no\r\ndanger when the very foundations of our civil constitution tremble? -\r\nWhen an attempt was first made to disturb the corner-stone of the\r\nfabrick, we were universally and justly alarmed: And can we be cool\r\nspectators, when we see it already removed from its place? With what\r\nresentment and indignation did we first receive the intelligence of a\r\ndesign to make us tributary, not to natural enemies, but infinitely\r\nmore humiliating, to fellow subjects? And yet with unparallelled\r\ninsolence we are told to be quiet, when we see that very money which\r\nis torn from us by lawless force, made use of still further to\r\noppress us - to feed and pamper a set of infamous wretches, who swarm\r\nlike the locusts of Egypt; and some of them expect to revel in wealth\r\nand riot on the spoils of our country. - Is it a time for us to sleep\r\nwhen our free government is essentially changed, and a new one is\r\nforming upon a quite different system? A government without the least\r\ndependance upon the people: A government under the absolute controul\r\nof a minister of state; upon whose sovereign dictates is to depend\r\nnot only the time when, and the place where, the legislative assembly\r\nshall sit, but whether it shall sit at all: And if it is allowed to\r\nmeet, it shall be liable immediately to be thrown out of existence,\r\nif in any one point it fails in obedience to his arbitrary mandates.\r\nHave we not already seen specimens of what we are to expect under\r\nsuch a government, in the instructions which Mr. HUTCHINSON has\r\nreceived, and which he has publickly avow'd, and declared he is bound\r\nto obey? - By one, he is to refuse his assent to a tax-bill, unless\r\nthe Commissioners of the Customs and other favorites are exempted:\r\nAnd if these may be freed from taxes by the order of a minister, may\r\nnot all his tools and drudges, or any others who are subservient to\r\nhis designs, expect the same indulgence? By another he is to forbid\r\nto pass a grant of the assembly to any agent, but one to whose\r\nelection he has given his consent; which is in effect to put it out\r\nof our power to take the necessary and legal steps for the redress of\r\nthose grievances which we suffer by the arts and machinations of\r\nministers, and their minions here. What difference is there between\r\nthe present state of this province, which in course will be the\r\ndeplorable state of all America, and that of Rome, under the law\r\nbefore mention'd? The difference is only this, that they gave their\r\nformal consent to the change, which we have not yet done. But let us\r\nbe upon our guard against even a negative submission; for agreeable\r\nto the sentiments of a celebrated writer, who thoroughly understood\r\nhis subject, if we are voluntarily silent, as the conspirators would\r\nhave us to be, it will be consider'd as an approbation of the change.\r\n\"By the fundamental laws of England, the two houses of parliament in\r\nconcert with the King, exercise the legislative power: But if the two\r\nhouses should be so infatuated, as to resolve to suppress their\r\npowers, and invest the King with the full and absolute government,\r\ncertainly the nation would not suffer it.\" And if a minister shall\r\nusurp the supreme and absolute government of America, and set up his\r\ninstructions as laws in the colonies, and their Governors shall be so\r\nweak or so wicked, as for the sake of keeping their places, to be\r\nmade the instruments in putting them in execution, who will presume\r\nto say that the people have not a right, or that it is not their\r\nindispensible duty to God and their Country, by all rational means in\r\ntheir power to RESIST THEM.\r\n\r\n\"Be firm, my friends, nor let UNMANLY SLOTH\r\nTwine round your hearts indissoluble chains.\r\nNe'er yet by force was freedom overcome.\r\nUnless CORRUPTION first dejects the pride,\r\nAnd guardian vigour of the free-born soul,\r\nAll crude attempts of violence are vain.\r\nDetermined, hold\r\nYour INDEPENDENCE; for, that once destroy'd,\r\nUnfounded Freedom is a morning dream.\"\r\n\r\nThe liberties of our Country, the freedom of our civil constitution\r\nare worth defending at all hazards: And it is our duty to defend them\r\nagainst all attacks. We have receiv'd them as a fair Inheritance from\r\nour worthy Ancestors: They purchas'd them for us with toil and danger\r\nand expence of treasure and blood; and transmitted them to us with\r\ncare and diligence. It will bring an everlasting mark of infamy on\r\nthe present generation, enlightned as it is, if we should suffer them\r\nto be wrested from us by violence without a struggle; or be cheated\r\nout of them by the artifices of false and designing men. Of the\r\nlatter we are in most danger at present: Let us therefore be aware of\r\nit. Let us contemplate our forefathers and posterity; and resolve to\r\nmaintain the rights bequeath'd to us from the former, for the sake of\r\nthe latter. - Instead of sitting down satisfied with the efforts we\r\nhave already made, which is the wish of our enemies, the necessity of\r\nthe times, more than ever, calls for our utmost circumspection,\r\ndeliberation, fortitude and perseverance. Let us remember, that \"if\r\nwe suffer tamely a lawless attack upon our liberty, we encourage it,\r\nand involve others in our doom.\" It is a very serious consideration,\r\nwhich should deeply impress our minds, that millions yet unborn may\r\nbe the miserable sharers in the event.\r\n\r\nCANDIDUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE SIGNED “VALERIUS POPLICOLA.\"1\r\n\r\n[Boston Gazette, October 28, 1771; the text is also in W. V. Wells,\r\nLife of Samuel Adams, vol. 1., pp. 427-432.]\r\n\r\nMessieurs EDES & GILL,\r\n\r\nTHE writer of the history of Massachusetts Bay tells us, that \"our\r\nancestors apprehended the acts of trade to be an invasion of the\r\nrights, liberties and properties of the subjects of his Majesty in\r\nthe colony, they not being represented in parliament; and according\r\nto the usual sayings of the learned in the law, the laws of England\r\nwere bounded within the four seas, and did not reach America.\r\nHowever, they made provision by an act of the colony, that they, i.e.\r\nthe acts of trade should be strictly attended from time to time\" -\r\n\r\nThe passing of this law of the colony, and thus making it an act of\r\ntheir own legislature, he says, \"plainly shows the wrong sense they\r\nhad of the relation they stood in to England \" - And he further adds,\r\nthat \"tho' their posterity have as high notions of English Liberties\r\nas they had, yet they are sensible that they are Colonists, and\r\ntherefore subject to the controul of the parent state.\" As I am not\r\ndisposed to yield an implicit assent to any authority whatever, I\r\nshould have been glad if this historian, since he thought proper to\r\npronounce upon so important a matter, had shown us what was the\r\npolitical relation our ancestors stood in to England, and how far, if\r\nat all, their posterity are subject to the controul of the parent\r\nstate. - If he had vouchsafed to have done this, when he published his\r\nhistory, he would have rendered the greatest service both to\r\nGreat-Britain and America, and eased the minds of multitudes who have\r\nbeen unsatisfied in points of such interesting importance.\r\n\r\nMr. Locke, in his treatise on government discovers the weakness of\r\nthis position, That every man is born a subject to his Prince, and\r\ntherefore is under the perpetual tie of subjection and allegiance;\r\nand he shows that express consent alone, makes any one a member of\r\nany commonwealth. He holds that submission to the laws of any country,\r\n& living quietly & enjoying privileges & protection under them, does\r\nnot make a man a member of that society, or a perpetual subject of\r\nthat commonwealth, any more than it would make a man subject to\r\nanother, in whose family he found it convenient to abide for some\r\ntime, tho' while he continued under it, he were obliged to comply with\r\nthe laws, and submit to the government he found there. Every man was\r\nborn naturally free; nothing can make a man a subject of any\r\ncommonwealth, but his actually entering into it by positive\r\nengagement, and express promise & compact.\r\n\r\nIf the sentiments of this great man are well grounded, our historian\r\nbefore he asserted so peremptorily that the ancestors of this country\r\nas colonists were subject to the controul of the parent state, should\r\nhave first made it appear that by positive engagement, or express\r\npromise or contract, they had thus bound themselves.\r\n\r\nEvery man being born free, says another distinguished writer, the son\r\nof a citizen, arrived at the years of discretion, may examine whether\r\nit be convenient for him to join in the society for which he was\r\ndestined by birth. If he finds that it will be no advantage for him\r\nto remain in it, he is at liberty to leave it, preserving as much as\r\nhis new engagements will allow him, the love and gratitude he owes\r\nit.2 He further says, \"There are cases in which a citizen has an\r\nabsolute right to renounce his country, and abandon it for ever\";\r\nwhich is widely different from the sentiment of the historian, that\r\n\"allegiance is not local, but perpetual and unalienable\": And among\r\nother cases in which a citizen has this absolute right, he mentions\r\nthat, when the sovereign, or the greater part of the nation will\r\npermit the exercise of only one religion in the state; which was the\r\ncase when our ancestors forsook their native country.\r\n\r\nThey were denied the rights of conscience. They left, it however with\r\nthe consent of the nation: It is allowed by this historian that they\r\ndeparted the kingdom with the leave of their prince. They removed at\r\ntheir own expence and not the nation's, into a country claimed and\r\npossessed by independent princes, whose right to the lordship and\r\ndominion thereof has been acknowledged by English kings; and they\r\nfairly purchased the lands of the rightful owners, and settled them\r\nat their own and not the nation's expence. It is incumbent then upon\r\nthis historian to show, by what rule of equity or right, unless they\r\nexpressly consented to it, they became subject to the controul of the\r\nparent state. - The obligation they had been under to submit to the\r\ngovernment of the nation, by virtue of their enjoyment of lands which\r\nwere under its jurisdiction, according to Mr. Locke, began and ended\r\nwith the enjoyment. That was but a tacit consent to the government;\r\nand when by donation, sale or otherwise, they quitted the possession\r\nof those lands, they were at liberty, unless it can be made to appear\r\nthey were otherwise bound by positive engagement or express contract,\r\nto incorporate into any other commonwealth, or begin a new one in\r\nvacuis locis, in any part of the world they could find free and\r\nunpossessed. - They entered into a compact, it is true, with the king\r\nof England, and upon certain conditions become his voluntary\r\nsubjects, not his slaves. But did they enter into an express promise\r\nto be subject to the controul of the parent state? What is there to\r\nshow that they were any way bound to obey the acts of the British\r\nparliament, but those very acts themselves? Is there any thing but\r\nthe mere ipse dixit of an historian, who for ought any one can tell,\r\ndesign'd to make a sacrifice to the ruling powers of Great-Britain,\r\nto show that the parent state might exercise the least controul over\r\nthem as Colonists, any more than the English parliament could\r\nexercise controul over the dominions which the Kings formerly held in\r\nFrance, or than it can now over the inhabitants of the moon, if there\r\nbe any?\r\n\r\nBy the charter of this province, the legislative power is in the\r\nGovernor, who is appointed by the King, the Council and House of\r\nRepresentatives. The legislative of any commonwealth must be the\r\nsupreme power. But if any edict or instruction of any body else, in\r\nwhat form soever conceiv'd, or by what power soever backed, can have\r\nthe force and obligation of a law in the province which has not its\r\nsanction from that legislative, it cannot be the supreme power. Its\r\nlaws however salutary, are liable at any time to be abrogated at the\r\npleasure of a superior power. No body can have a power to make laws\r\nover a free people, but by their own consent, and by authority\r\nreceiv'd from them: It follows then, either that the people of this\r\nprovince have consented & given authority to the parent state to make\r\nlaws over them, or that she has no such authority. No one I believe\r\nwill pretend that the parent state receives any authority from the\r\npeople of this province to make laws for them, or that they have ever\r\nconsented she should. If the people of this province are a part of\r\nthe body politick of Great Britain, they have as such a right to be\r\nconsulted in the making of all acts of the British parliament of what\r\nnature soever. If they are a separate body politick, and are free,\r\nthey have a right equal to that of the people of Great Britain to\r\nmake laws for themselves, and are no more than they, subject to the\r\ncontroul of any legislature but their own. \"The lawful power of\r\nmaking laws to command whole politick societies of men, belongs so\r\nproperly unto the same intire societies, that for any prince or\r\npotentate of what kind soever upon earth to exercise the same of\r\nhimself, and not by express commission immediately and personally\r\nreceiv'd from God, or else from authority deriv'd at the first from\r\ntheir consent, upon whose persons they impose laws, is no better than\r\nmere tyranny. Laws therefore they are not which publick approbation\r\nhath not made so.3 This was the reason given by our ancestors why\r\nthey should not be bound by the acts of parliament, because not being\r\nrepresented in parliament, the publick approbation of the province\r\nhad not made them laws. And this is the reason why their posterity do\r\nnot hold themselves rightly oblig'd to submit to the revenue acts now\r\nin being, because they never consented to them. The former, under\r\ntheir circumstances, thought it prudent to adopt the acts of trade,\r\nby passing a law of their own, and thus formally consenting that they\r\nshould be observ'd. But the latter I presume will never think it\r\nexpedient to copy after their example.\r\n\r\nThe historian tells his readers that \"They (the people of this\r\nprovince) humbly hope for all that tenderness and indulgence from a\r\nBritish parliament, which the Roman senate, while Rome remain'd free,\r\nshewed to Roman colonies\" - Why the conduct of Rome towards her\r\ncolonies should be recommended as an example to our parent state,\r\nrather than that of Greece, is difficult to conjecture, unless it was\r\nbecause as has been observed, the latter was more generous and a\r\nbetter mother to her colonies than the former. Be that as it may, the\r\ncolonists have a right to expect from the parent state all possible\r\ntenderness; not only as they sprang from her, and are subjects of the\r\nsame King, but as they have greatly contributed to her wealth &\r\ngrandeur: And we are willing to render to her respect and certain\r\nexpressions of honor and reverence as the Grecian colonies did to the\r\ncity from whence they deriv'd their origin, as Grotius says, so long\r\nas the colonies were well treated. By our compact with our King,\r\nwherein is contain'd the rule of his government and the measure of our\r\nsubmission, we have all the liberties and immunities of Englishmen,\r\nto all intents, purposes and constructions whatever; and no King of\r\nGreat-Britain, were he inclin'd, could have a right either with or\r\nwithout his parliament, to deprive us of those liberties - They are\r\noriginally from God and nature, recognized in the Charter, and\r\nentail'd to us and our posterity: It is our duty therefore to\r\ncontend for them whenever attempts are made to violate them.\r\n\r\nHe also says that \"the people of Ireland were under the same\r\nmistake\" with our ancestors; that is, in thinking themselves exempt\r\nfrom the controul of English acts of parliament. But nothing drops\r\nfrom his pen to shew that this was a mistake, excepting that\r\n\"particular persons in Ireland did pennance for advancing and\r\nadhering to those principles.\" The same mighty force of reasoning is\r\nused to prove that this colony was mistaken, viz. \"They suffer'd the\r\nloss of the charter.\" Such arguments may serve to evince the power\r\nof the parent state, but neither its wisdom nor justice appears from\r\nthem. The sense of the nation however was very different after the\r\nrevolution. The House of Commons voted the judgment against the\r\nCharter a Grievance; and a bill was brought in and passed that house\r\nfor restoring the Charters, among which that of this province was\r\nexpresly mentioned; notwithstanding the mistake abovemention'd was\r\none great article of charge against it.

Lee, Life of Arthur Lee, vol. ii., pp. 184-187.]\r\nBOSTON Octob 31 1771.\r\n\r\nSir\r\n\r\nI Inclose a printed Copy of a Resolve of the Council of this\r\nprovince, whereby Junius Americanus is censurd for asserting that\r\nthe late Secretary Oliver stood recorded in the Councils Books as a\r\nperjurd traitor. You may easily suppose that the Friends of America\r\nfor whom that Writer has been & is a firm & able Advocate, resent\r\nthis Conduct of the Council whose Ingratitude to say nothing of the\r\nInjustice of this proceeding is the more extraordinary as Junius\r\nAmericanus has taken so much pains to vindicate that very Body\r\nagainst the malignant Aspersions of Bernard & others. There was\r\nhowever only Eight of twenty six Councellors present when they were\r\nprevaild upon by an artful man to pass this Resolve. You will see by\r\nthe inclosd some remarks upon the former proceedings of the Council,\r\nor rather a recital of parts of them, by which I think it appears\r\nthat the Assertion could not be groundless nor malicious; nor can it\r\nbe false if their own publication is true. I can conceive that the\r\nDesign of the first mover of this Resolve was to injure the Credit\r\nof all the Writings of Junius Americanus, which I believe he very\r\nsensibly feels, & also to make it appear to the World that the\r\nCouncil, as they had before said of the House, had departed from &\r\ndisavowd the Sentiments of former Assemblys; and that this Change\r\nhas been effected by the Influence of Mr. Hutchinson. With Regard to\r\nthe Council, it is hardly possible for any one at a distance to\r\nascertain their political Sentiments from what they see of their\r\ndeterminations publishd here in general, for it has been the\r\npractice of the Governor to summon a general Council at the Time\r\nwhen the Assembly is sitting & of Course the whole Number of\r\nCouncillors is present - but in their Capacity of Advisers to the\r\nGovernor they are adjournd from week to week during the Session of\r\nthe Assembly & till it is over when the Country Gentlemen Members of\r\nCouncil return home. Thus the general Council being kept alive by\r\nAdjournments, the principal & most important part of the Business of\r\ntheir executive department is done by seven or eight who live in &\r\nabout the Town, & if the Governor can manage a Majority of so small\r\na Number, Matters will be conducted according to his mind. I believe\r\nI may safely affirm that by far the greater Number of civil officers\r\nhave been appointed at these adjournments; so that it is much the\r\nsame as if they were appointed solely by our ostensible Governor or\r\nrather by his Master, the Minister for the time being. You will not\r\nthen be surprisd if I tell you that among the five Judges of our\r\nSuperior Court of Justice, there are the following near Connections\r\nwith the first & second in Station in the province. Mr Lynde is\r\nChiefe Justice; his Daughter is married to the Son of Mr Oliver, the\r\nLt Govr; Mr Oliver another of the Judges is his Brother; his Son\r\nmarried Gov Hutchinsons Daughter; & Judge Hutchinson lately\r\nappointed, who is also Judge of the probate of Wills for the first\r\nCounty, an important department, is the Govrs brother. Besides which\r\nthe young Mr Oliver is a Justice of the Common pleas for the County\r\nof Essex. Mr Cotton a Brother in Law of the Govr is deputy Secretary\r\nof the province & Register in the probate office under Mr\r\nHutchinson; a cousin german of the Govr was sent for out of another\r\nprovince to fill up the place of Clerk to the Common pleas in this\r\nCounty; & the eldest Son of the Govr will probably soon be appointed\r\na Justice of the same Court in the room of his Uncle advancd to the\r\nsuperior bench. I should have first mentiond that the Gov & the Lt\r\nGov' are Brothers by Marriage.\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives, notwithstanding the Advantages which a\r\nnew Governor always has in his hands I have reason to think will be\r\nso firm as at least not to give up any Right. The Body of the people\r\nare uneasy at the large Strides that are made & making towards an\r\nabsolute Tyranny - many are alarmd but are of different Sentiments\r\nwith regard to the next step to be taken - some indeed think that\r\nevery Step has been taken but one & the ultima Ratio would require\r\nprudence unanimity and fortitude. The Conspirators against our\r\nLiberties are employing all their Influence to divide the people,\r\npartly by intimidating them for which purpose a fleet of Ships lies\r\nwithin gun Shot of the Town & the Capital Fort within three miles of\r\nit is garrisond by the Kings Troops, and partly by Arts & Intrigue;\r\nby flattering those who are pleasd with Flattery; forming\r\nConnections with them, introducing Levity Luxury & Indolence &\r\nassuring them that if they are quiet the Ministry will alter their\r\nMeasures. I fear some of the Southern Colonies are taken with this\r\nBait, for we see hardly anything in their publick papers but\r\nAdvertisements of the Baubles of Britain for sale. This is the\r\ngeneral Appearance of things here while the people are anxiously\r\nwaiting for some happy Event from your side the Water - for my own\r\npart I confess I have no great Expectations from thence, & have long\r\nbeen of Opinion that America herself under God must finally work out\r\nher own Salvation.\r\n\r\nI have been told by a friend that a Manuscript has been sent from\r\nhence upon the Subject of the Tryals of Preston & the Soldiers, for\r\nyour perusal entitled a Hue & Cry &c. Had I seen & thought it\r\nanswerable to what I have heard of it, I should have endeavord to\r\nhave had it publishd here. I wish it had been or still might be\r\npublishd in London if you have seen it & think it worth while,\r\nsubject entirely to your Correction and Amendment. But after all\r\nwhat will the best & most animating publications signify, if the\r\nmany are willing to submit & be enslavd by the few.\r\n\r\nI wrote you about a fortnight past by Capt.

However mysterious fawning priests and flatterers may\r\naffect to think it, Kings and Governors may be guilty of treason and\r\nrebellion: And they have in general in all ages and countries been\r\nmore frequently guilty of it, than their subjects. Nay, what has\r\nbeen commonly called rebellion in the people, has often been nothing\r\nelse but a manly & glorious struggle in opposition to the lawless\r\npower of rebellious Kings and Princes; who being elevated above the\r\nrest of mankind, and paid by them only to be their protectors, have\r\nbeen taught by enthusiasts to believe they were authoriz'd by GOD to\r\nenslave and butcher them! It is not uncommon for men, by their own\r\ninattention and folly, to suffer those things which an all-gracious\r\nprovidence design'd for their good, to become the greatest evils. If\r\nwe look into the present state of the world, I believe this will\r\nhold good with regard to civil government in general: And the\r\nhistory of past ages will inform us, that even those civil\r\ninstitutions which have been best calculated for the safety and\r\nhappiness of the people, have sooner or later degenerated into\r\nsettled tyranny; which can no more be called civil government, and\r\nis in fact upon some accounts a state much more to be deprecated\r\nthan anarchy itself. It may be said of each, that it is a state of\r\nwar: And it is beyond measure astonishing that free people can see\r\nthe miseries of such a state approaching to them with large and\r\nhasty strides, and suffer themselves to be deluded by the artful\r\ninsinuations of a man in tower, and his indefatigable sychophants,\r\ninto a full perswasion that their liberties are in no danger. May we\r\nnot be allow'd to adopt the language of scripture, and apply it upon\r\nso important a consideration; that seeing, men will see and not\r\nperceive, and hearing, they will hear and not understand?\r\n\r\nJeroboam must needs have been a very wicked Governor: And he\r\ndiscover'd so much of the malignancy of treason against his people,\r\nin making them to sin against the supreme Being upon whose power and\r\nprotection the welfare of nations as well as individuals so\r\nmanifestly depends, and by whose goodness that people in particular\r\nwere so greatly oblig'd, that one would have thought, they would\r\nupon a retrospect of their folly, in being thus seduc'd, have\r\ntestified to future generations their just resentment and\r\nindignation, by at least dethroning so impious a traitor. Perhaps\r\nthey relented when they consider'd that their Governor was \"born and\r\neducated among them\": But this heightened his wickedness; as it\r\nmight have convinc'd them, that he was as destitute of the common\r\nfeelings of love for one's native country, as he was of religion and\r\npiety. This, and many other instances of later date may serve to\r\nshow, that the people have no solid reason to depend upon every man\r\nthat he will be a good Governor, merely because of his having had\r\nhis birth and education among them; as well as the folly and\r\nwickedness of priests and minions, who would from such a\r\ncircumstance endeavor to dupe the people into a perswasion of their\r\nsecurity under any man's administration. - The sin which the people\r\nof Israel were prevail'd upon by Jeroboam the son of Nebat to\r\ncommit, respected their religious worship on a Thanksgiving day: He\r\nhad ordained a solemn festival to be kept at Bethel; in which, it\r\nseems, he had a particular view to serve a political purpose: And\r\nthe people knew it, although he had artfully endeavored to colour it\r\nwith a plausible appearance. At this festival, through his\r\ninfluence, they sacrificed unto Calves! This was the dire effect of\r\ntheir foolish adulation of their Governor, while they professed to\r\nobserve a day set apart in honor to the King of kings. - Their\r\nthanksgiving began with prophaness & ended in idolatry; or rather it\r\nbegan & ended with both. There is no question but the priests were\r\nthe vicegerents of the Governor, or his heralds to publish his\r\nimpious proclamations to the people. But is it not strange that the\r\npeople were so king-ridden and priest-ridden, especially in matters\r\nwhich concern'd their Religion, as to look upon the joint authority\r\nof their Governor and Clergy, sufficient to justify them in sinning\r\nagainst the authority of God himself: and in acting in open violation\r\nof his law, revealed to them from Heaven with signs and miracles at\r\nMount Sinai, and register'd in their book of the law, as well as\r\nengrav'd on the tables of their hearts! - It is no unusual thing for\r\npeople to complement their Governors with the sacrifice of their\r\nconsciences, after they have surrender'd to them their civil liberty,\r\nwhich had been the folly of that people long before; for they grew\r\nweary of their liberty in the days of Samuel the prophet, and\r\nexchanged that civil government which the wisdom of heaven had\r\nprescribed to them, for an absolute despotic monarchy; that they might\r\nin that regard be like the nations round about them. - Even in these\r\nenlightened times, the people in some parts of the world are so\r\nbewitched by the enchantments of priest-craft and king- craft, as to\r\nbelieve that tho' they sin against their own consciences, in\r\ncompliance with the instruction of the one, or in obedience to the\r\ncommand of the other, they shall never suffer, but shall be rewarded\r\nin the world to come, for being so implicitly subject to the higher\r\npowers: And the experience of the world tells us that there are, and\r\nalways have been various ways of rewarding them for it in this world.\r\nOn the contrary, if they hesitate to declare a blind belief in the\r\nmost palpable absurdities in government and religion, they are sure to\r\nfall into the immediate hands of spiritual inquisitors, to be whipped\r\nand tortured into an acknowledgment of the error, or threatened with\r\nthe further pains of eternal damnation if they persist in their\r\ncontumacy. Thanks be to GOD, there is not yet so formidable a junction\r\nof the secular and ecclesiastical powers in this country; and there is\r\nreason to hope there are but few of the clergy who would desire it.\r\nYet such is the deplorable condition we are in, and so notorious is it\r\nto all, that should any man, be he who he may, tell me that our civil\r\nliberties were continued, or that our religious privileges were not in\r\ndanger, I should detest him, if in his senses, as a perfidious man.\r\nAnd if any clergyman should in compliance with the humours or designs\r\nof a man in power, echo such a false declaration in the church of GOD,\r\nhe would in my opinion do well seriously to consider, whether an\r\nexcessive complaisance may not have betrayed him into the sin of\r\nAnanias and Saphira, in lying against the Holy Ghost! This is a most\r\nweighty consideration: But the times require plain dealing. We hope\r\nand believe, nay we know that there are more than seven thousand who\r\nwill never bow the knee to Baal, or servilely submit to Tyranny,\r\ntemporal or spiritual: But are we not fallen into an age when some\r\neven of the Clergy think it no shame to flatter the Idol; and\r\nthereby to lay the people, as in the days of Jeroboam, the son of\r\nNebat, under a temptation to commit great wickedness, and sin\r\nagainst God? Let us beware of the poison of flattery - If the people\r\nare tainted with this folly, they will never have VIRTUE enough to\r\ndemand a restoration of their liberties in the very face of a\r\nTYRANT, if the necessity of the times should call for so noble an\r\nexertion. And how soon there may be such NECESSITY, GOD only knows.\r\nMay HE grant them FORTITUDE as well as SOUND PRUDENCE in the day of\r\nTRIAL! He who can flatter a despot, or be flattered by him, without\r\nfeeling the remonstrances of his own mind against it, may be\r\nremarkable for the guise and appearance of sanctity, but he has very\r\nlittle if any true religion - If he habitually allows himself in it,\r\nwithout any remorse, he is a hardened impenitent sinner against GOD\r\nand his COUNTRY. Whatever his profession may be, he is not fit to be\r\ntrusted; and when once discover'd, he will never be trusted by any\r\nbut fools and children. To complement a great man to the injury of\r\ntruth and liberty, may be in the opinion of a very degenerate age,\r\nthe part of a polite and well-bred gentleman - Wise men however will\r\ndenominate him a Traitor or a Fool. But how much more aggravated\r\nmust be the folly and madness of those, who instead of worshipping\r\nGOD in the solemn assembly, \"in spirit and in truth,\" can utter a\r\nlie TO HIM!! -in order to render themselves acceptable to a man who\r\nis a worm or to the son of a man who is a worm.\r\n\r\nCANDIDUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ARTHUR LEE.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library; a text with variations is\r\nin R. H. Lee, Life of Arthur Lee, vol. ii., pp. 187-189.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON Novr 13 1771.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR, - Several Vessells have lately arrivd from London, but\r\nI have not had the pleasure of a Line from you by either of them.\r\nSince the Resolve of Council, by which Junius Americanus was so\r\nseverely censurd, there has been a proclamation issued by the\r\nGovernor with their Advice, for a general Thanksgiving which has\r\nbeen the practice of the Country at this time of the year from its\r\nfirst Settlement. The pious proclamation has given the greatest\r\noffence to the people in general, as it appears evidently to be\r\ncalculated to serve the purpose of the British Administration,\r\nrather than that of Religion. We were the last year called upon to\r\nthank the Almighty for the Blessings of the Administration of\r\nGovernment, in this Province, which many lookd upon as an impious\r\nFarce. Now we are demurely exhorted to render our hearty & humble\r\nThanks to the same omniscient Being for the Continuance of our civil\r\n& religious Privileges & the Enlargement of our Trade. This I imagine\r\nwas contrivd to try the feelings of the people; and if the Governor\r\ncould dupe the Clergy as he had the Council, & they the people, so\r\nthat the proclamation should be read as usual in our Churches, he\r\nwould have nothing to do but acquaint Lord Hillsborough that most\r\ncertainly the people in General acquiescd in the measures of\r\nGovernment, since they had appealed even to God himself that\r\nnotwithstanding the faction & turbulence of a party, their Liberties\r\nwere continued & their Trade enlargd. I am at a loss to say whether\r\nthis measure was more insolent to the people or affrontive to the\r\nMajesty of Heaven, neither of whom however a modern Politician\r\nregards, if at all, so much as the Smiles of his noble Patron. But\r\nthe people saw thro it in general, & openly declared that they would\r\nnot hear the proclamation read. The Consequence was, that it was\r\nread in but two of all our Churches in this Town consisting of\r\ntwelve besides three Episcopalian Churches; there indeed it has not\r\nbeen customary ever to read them. Of those two Clergymen who read\r\nit, one of them being a Stranger in the province, & having been\r\nsettled but about Six Weeks, performd the servile task a week before\r\nthe usual Time when the people were not aware of it, they were\r\nhowever much disgusted at it. The Minister of the other is a known\r\nFlatterer of the Governor & is the very person who formd the fulsome\r\nAddress of which I wrote you some time ago - he was deserted by a\r\ngreat number of his Auditory in the midst of his reading. Thus every\r\nArt is practisd & every Tool employd to make it appear as if this\r\npeople were easy in their Chains, & that this great revolution is\r\nbrought about by the inimitable Address of Mr Hutchinson. There is\r\none part of the proclamation which I think deserves Notice on your\r\nside the Water, & that relates to the Accommodation with the\r\nSpaniards in the Affair of Faulkland Island. This must have been\r\nreferrd to under the Terms of the preservation of the peace of\r\nEurope. From what I wrote you last you cannot wonder if the Governor\r\ncarrys any thing he pleases in his Divan here. His last Manoevre has\r\nexposd him more than any thing. Ne lude cum sacris is a proverb.\r\nShould he once lose the Reputation which his friends have with the\r\nutmost pains been building for him among the Clergy for these thirty\r\nyears past, as a consummate Saint, he must fall like Samson when his\r\nLocks were cut off. The people are determind to keep their Day of\r\nFestivity but not for all the purposes of the infamous proclamation.\r\nI beg you would omit no Opportunity of writing to me & be assured\r\nthat I am in a Stile too much out of fashion\r\n\r\nYour Friend\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE SIGNED \"COTTON MATHER.\"1\r\n\r\n[Boston Gazette, November 25, 1771.]\r\n\r\nMESSIEURS EDES & GILL,\r\n\r\nMucius SCAEVOLA, a writer whom I very much admire, tells us, \"A\r\nMassachusetts Governor the King by Compact may nominate and appoint,\r\nbut not pay: For his support he must stipulate with the people, &\r\nuntil he does, he is no legal Governor; without this, if he undertakes\r\nto rule he is a USURPER.\" - These sentiments have given great disgust\r\nto the Governor & Council, and the publisher, it is said, is to be\r\nprosecuted: But if he has spoken the words of truth and soberness,\r\nwhy should he be punished? Is there any man in the community that\r\ncan procure harm in a process of law, to him who speaks necessary\r\nand important truths? If there be such a man, mark him for a Tyrant.\r\nIs there any man whose publick conduct will not bear the scrutiny of\r\ntruth? he is a Traitor, and it is high time he was pointed out.\r\n\r\nI have upon this occasion looked into the Charter of the province in\r\nwhich the COMPACT between the King and the people is contain'd, and\r\nI find not a single word about the King's paying his Governor. If\r\ntherefore the Charter is altogether silent about it, Mucius is\r\ncertainly to be justified in saying that by the compact the King may\r\nnot pay him; that is, there is nothing in the Charter to warrant it.\r\nBut it is asked, whether the King may not pay his Governor\r\nnotwithstanding? And ought it not to be looked upon as a mark of\r\nroyal bounty and goodness, thus to save the people from being\r\n\"burdened by a tax upon their polls and estates for a Governor's\r\nsupport?\" This is the Court language; and great pains have been\r\ntaken by some gentlemen, whose particular business it is to ride\r\nthrough the several counties, to spread it in every part of the\r\nprovince. But it has a tendency to mislead and ensnare. It no doubt\r\nsounds very agreeably in the ears of an unwary man, that by this\r\nministerial manoeuvre, the province have a saving of a thousand\r\npounds sterling every year, for the support of a Governor. Let us\r\nconsider the matter a little. Did not our ancestors, when they\r\naccepted this Charter, understand that they had contracted for a\r\nfree government? And did not the King on his part intend that it\r\nshould be so? Was it not understood, that by this contract every\r\npower of government was to be under a check adequate to the\r\nimportance of it, without which, according to the best reasoners on\r\ngovernment, and the experience of mankind in all ages of the world,\r\nthat power must be a tyranny? Undoubtedly it was the sense of both\r\nparties in the contract, that the government to be erected by the\r\nCharter, should be a free government, and that every power of it\r\nshould be properly controuled in order to constitute it so. I would\r\nthen ask, what weight remains in the scale of the democratick part\r\nof the constitution to check the monarchick in the hands of the\r\ngovernor, if the king has not only an uncontroulable power to\r\nnominate and appoint a governor, but may pay him too? If any one\r\nwill point out to me a sufficient weight to balance the scale, I\r\nwill differ from Mucius: But until that is done, I must be of his\r\nmind, that the king has no right to pay his governor: \"For that, he\r\nmust stipulate with the people;\" otherwise our civil constitution is\r\nrendered materially different from what the contracting parties\r\nintended it should be, viz, a free constitution. It places the\r\ngovernor in such a state of independency as must make any man\r\nformidable. - It puts it in his power in many instances to act the\r\ntyrant, even under the appearance of all the forms of the\r\nconstitution. The man who is possessed of a power to act the tyrant\r\nwhen he thinks proper, let him become possessed of it as he may, is\r\nat least an USURPER of power that cannot belong to him in any free\r\nstate - Power is intoxicating: There have been few men, if any, who\r\nwhen possessed of an unrestrained power, have not made a very bad\r\nuse of it - They have generally exercised such a power to the terror\r\nboth of the good and the evil, and of the good more than the evil -\r\nWhile a governor is possessed of a power without any other check\r\nthan that which the constitution has provided, upon a supposition\r\nthat the king by charter may pay him as well as appoint him, for\r\naught I can see, under such an administration as the present, I mean\r\nin England, he may make the people slaves as soon as he pleases and\r\nkeep them so as long as he pleases. I have heard it asked, What! may\r\nnot the king make a present to his governor of fifteen hundred\r\nsterling every year, if he sees fit? Is not his MAJESTY allowed to\r\nbe upon a footing with even a private subject? This reasoning is\r\nvery plausible, but I think not just. In some respects the king is\r\nmore restrained than the lowest of his subjects. He may not for\r\ninstance, turn a Roman Catholic, or marry one of that religion and\r\nhold his crown: He forfeits it by law if he does. And why? Because\r\nit has been found that the Roman Catholic principles are\r\ninconsistent with the principles of the British constitution, which\r\nis the rule of his government. And there is the same reason why the\r\ngovernor who is appointed by the crown, should stipulate with the\r\npeople for his support, if that mutual check among the several\r\npowers of government, which is essential to every free constitution,\r\nis otherwise destroyed. - If the king's paying or making yearly\r\npresents to his governor, renders him a different being in the state\r\nfrom that which the Charter intends he shall be, and that to the\r\nprejudice of the people, the king by the compact may not pay him,\r\nfor in such a case, it would be inconsistent with the principles of\r\nour constitution - No king can have a right to put it in the power\r\nof his governor to become a tyrant, or govern arbitrarily; for he\r\ncannot be a tyrant or govern arbitrarily himself.\r\n\r\nI beg leave to make a supposition; If his Holiness the Pope, for the\r\nsake of once more having a Catholic King seated on the British\r\nthrone, should make him a present yearly of eight hundred thousand\r\npounds sterling, for the support of himself and his household, it\r\nwould be a great saving indeed to the nation; but would the people,\r\nthink you, consent to it because of that saving? Should we not hear\r\nthe faithful Commons objecting to it as an innovation big with\r\ndanger to the rights and liberties of the nation? I believe it would\r\nbe in vain to flatter them that their constituents would be eas'd of\r\na burden of a tax upon their polls and estates, by means which would\r\nrender their king thus independent of them, and place him in a state\r\nof absolute dependance, for his support, upon another, who had\r\nespecially for a long course of years, tried every art and\r\nmachination to overthrow their constitution in church and state -\r\nWould not the people justly think there would be danger that such a\r\nking thus dependent on the pope, and oblig'd by him, would be as\r\nsubservient to the admonitions of his Holiness, or his Legate in his\r\nname, as a certain provincial governor, we know, has been to the\r\ninstructions of a minister of state, upon the bare prospect of his\r\nbeing made independent of the people for his support.\r\n\r\nCOTTON MATHER.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Attributed to Adams in the Dorr file of the Gazette.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE SIGNED \"CANDIDUS.\"\r\n\r\n[Boston Gazette, December 2, 1771.]\r\n\r\nMessieurs EDES & GILL,\r\n\r\nNo methods are yet left untried by the writers on the side of the\r\nministry, to perswade this People that the best way to get rid of\r\nour Grievances is to submit to them. This was the artifice of\r\nGovernor Bernard, and it is urg'd with as much zeal as ever, under\r\nthe administration of Governor Hutchinson. They would fain have us\r\nendure the loss of as many of our Rights and Liberties as an\r\nabandon'd ministry shall see fit to wrest from us, without the least\r\nmurmur: But when they find, that they cannot silence our complaints,\r\n& sooth us into security they then tell us, that \"much may be done\r\nfor the publick interest by way of humble & dutiful representation,\r\npointing out the hardships of certain measures\" - This is the\r\nlanguage of Chronus in the last Massachusetts Gazette. But have we\r\nnot already petition'd the King for the Redress of our Grievances\r\nand the Restoration of our Liberties? - have not the House of\r\nRepresentatives done it in the most dutiful terms imaginable? - Was\r\nit not many months before that Petition was suffer'd to reach the\r\nroyal hand? - And after it was laid before his Majesty, was he not\r\nadvis'd by his ministers to measures still more grevious and severe?\r\nHave any lenient measures been the consequence of our humble\r\nrepresentations of \"the hardship of certain measures,\" which were\r\nset forth by the house of assembly in the most decent and respectful\r\nletters to persons of high rank in the administration of government\r\nat home? Did not the deputies of most of the towns and districts in\r\nthis province met in Convention in the year 1768, when Bernard had\r\nin a very extraordinary manner dissolv'd the General Assembly? - Did\r\nthey not, I say, in the most humble terms, petition the Throne for\r\nthe Redress of the intolerable grievances we then labor'd under? -\r\nHas not the Town of Boston most submissively represented \"the\r\nhardship of certain measures\" to their most gracious Sovereign, and\r\npetition'd for Right and Relief? - Was not petitioning and humbly\r\nsupplicating, the method constantly propos'd by those very persons\r\nwhom Chronus after the manner of his brethren, stiles \"pretended\r\npatriots \", and constantly adopted till it was apparent that our\r\npetitions and representations were treated with neglect and\r\ncontempt? - Till we found that even our petitioning was looked upon\r\nas factious, and the effects of it were the heaping Grievance upon\r\nGrievance? - Have not the people of this province, after all their\r\nhumble supplications, been falsly charg'd with being \"in a state of\r\ndisobedience to all law and government?\" And in consequence of\r\npetitioning, has not the capital been filled with soldiers to quiet\r\ntheir murmurs with the bayonet; & to murder, assassinate & plunder\r\nwith impunity? -Have we not borne for these seven years past such\r\nindignity as no free people ever suffer'd before, and with no other\r\ntokens of resentment on our part, than pointing out our hardships,\r\nand appealing to the common sense of mankind, after we had in vain\r\npetition'd our most gracious Sovereign? - And now we are even\r\ninsulted by those who have bro't on us all these difficulties, for\r\nuttering our just complaints in a publick Newspaper! Pointing out\r\nthe hardships of our sufferings, and calling upon the impartial\r\nworld to judge between us and our oppressors, and protesting before\r\nGod and man against innovations big with ruin to the public Liberty,\r\nis call'd by this writer, \"a stubborn opposition to public authority,\"\r\nand \"a high hand opposition and repugnancy to government\" For God's\r\nsake, what are we to expect from petitioning? Have we any prospect in\r\nthe way of humble and dutiful representation? Let us advert to the\r\nnation of which this writer says we are a part. Are not they suffering\r\nthe same grievances, under the same administration? Have not they\r\nrepeatedly petitioned and remonstrated to the throne, and \"pointed out\r\nthe hardships of certain measures,\" to the King himself? And has not\r\nhis Majesty been advised by his ministers, to treat them as imaginary\r\ngrievances only? And yet after all, against repeated facts, and common\r\nexperience to the contrary, we are told, that \"much might be done\r\nfor the public interest, by way of hunible and dutiful\r\nrepresentation!\" If there were even now, any hopes that the King\r\nwould hear us, while his present counsellors are near him, I should\r\nbe by all means for petitioning again; but every man of common\r\nobservation will judge for himself of the prospect.\r\n\r\nI am not of this writers opinion that the claims of our sister\r\ncolonies, New-Hampshire and Rhode-Island, were so very reasonable,\r\nwhen disputes arose about the dividing lines; nor do I believe any\r\nof his disinterested readers will think his bare ipse dixit, however\r\nperemptory, a sufficient evidence of it. - It seems in the\r\nestimation of Chronus and his few confederates, all are \"intemperate\r\npatriots \", who will not yield the public rights to every demand,\r\nhowever unjust it may appear. - Thus a whole General Assembly is\r\nbranded by this writer, with the character of \"wrong-headed\r\npoliticians \", for not surrendering a part of the territory of this\r\nprovince to New-Hampshire and Rhode-Island, because they demanded\r\nit. It is no uncommon thing for those who are resolved to carry a\r\nfavorite point, when they cannot reason with their opponents, to\r\nrail at them. -I shall not take upon me at present to say, whether\r\nthe claims of those governments were right or wrong; but if the\r\ngovernor of the province, & a majority of the two houses, whom\r\nChronus does not scruple to call \"pretended patriots \", then judged\r\nthem to be wrong, their conduct in contending for the interest of\r\nthe province, affords sufficient evidence, that they were real\r\npatriots. These instances are bro't by Chronus to show the wisdom\r\n\"of scorning the influence, and rejecting the rash and injudicious\r\nclamour of pretended patriots, and wrong-headed politicians,\" in the\r\npresent assembly; who by their \"indecent treatment of his Majesty's\r\ngovernor, are pressing him to comply with measures contrary to his\r\ninstructions\": But if his Majesty's governor's instructions are\r\nrepugnant to the Rights and Liberties of his Majesty's subjects\r\nof this province, and those who are elected by the people to be the\r\nguardians of their rights and liberties, are really of that mind;\r\nespecially if they also think that such instructions are design'd to\r\nhave the force of laws; is it reasonable or decent for Chronus, tho'\r\nhe may think differently, to call them mere pretended patriots, which\r\nconveys the idea of false-hearted men, for protesting against such\r\ninstructions, as dangerous innovations, threatning the \"very being of\r\ngovernment\", as constituted by the Charter? Chronus and his brethren\r\nwould do well to consider, that \"a high handed opposition and\r\nrepugnance, ('tis a wonder he did not in the style of his friend\r\nBernard, call it 'oppugnation') to government \", is as dangerous when\r\nlevel'd at the representative body of the people, as at \"his Majesty's\r\nGovernor\": An attack upon the constitution especially in that silent\r\nmanner in which it has of late been attacked, is more dangerous than\r\neither. - He says that those \"wretched politicians \", \"have made the\r\nGovernor's subsistence to depend upon his compliance with measures\r\ncontrary to his instructions.\" If this had been true, it would have\r\nbeen treating the Governor in a manner in which the British\r\nparliaments, when free, have treated their sovereign: No supplies\r\ntill grievances are redressed, has been the language of those \"wrong\r\nheaded politicians \", the British house of commons in former, and\r\nbetter times, than these - If the commons of this province have at\r\nany time withheld their grant for the support of a governor, till he\r\nshould comply with measures contrary to his instructions, they\r\nlooking upon those instructions, as they have been, in fact,\r\nrepugnant to the very spirit of the charter, and subversive of the\r\nliberty of their constituents, who can blame them? They are in my\r\nopinion highly to be commended, for making use of a power vested in\r\nthem, or rather reserv'd by the constitution, & originally intended\r\nto check the wanton career of imperious governors - A power, in the\r\ndue exercise of which, even KINGS, their masters, have sometimes\r\nbeen brought to their senses, when they had any. But Chronus cannot\r\nshow an instance of this conduct in the house of representatives for\r\nmany years past, I dare say. It must therefore be a mistake in him\r\nto suppose that this conduct of \"our intemperate patriots\", has\r\n\"occasion'd his Majesty to render him more independent, by taking\r\nthe payment of his governor upon himself.\" I make no doubt but some\r\nother motive occasion'd the minister to advise an independent\r\ngovernor in this province, which will in all probability take place\r\nin every colony throughout America. - The motive is too obvious to\r\nneed mentioning - If Chronus will make it appear that a governor's\r\nbeing made independent of the people, is not repugnant to the\r\nprinciples of the charter of this province, or any free government,\r\nhe will do more than I at present think he or any other can - Till\r\nthis is done, it is in vain to flatter a sensible people with the\r\nprospect of enjoying \"peace, happiness or any other blessing they\r\nhave reason to desire,\" and right to expect from good government,\r\nwhile the measure is persisted in.\r\n\r\nCANDIDUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE SIGNED \"CANDIDUS.\"\r\n\r\n[Boston Gazette, December 9, 1771.]\r\n\r\nMESSIEURS EDES & GILL,\r\n\r\n\"Whene'er from putrid Courts foul Vapours rose,\r\nwith vigorous wholesome Gales\r\nThe Winds of OPPOSITION fiercely blew,\r\nWhich purg'd and clear'd the agitated State\"\r\n\r\nIf the liberties of America are ever compleatly ruined, of which in\r\nmy opinion there is now the utmost danger, it will in all\r\nprobability be the consequence of a mistaken notion of prudence,\r\nwhich leads men to acquiesce in measures of the most destructive\r\ntendency for the sake of present ease. When designs are form'd to\r\nrase the very foundation of a free government, those few who are to\r\nerect their grandeur and fortunes upon the general ruin, will employ\r\nevery art to sooth the devoted people into a state of indolence,\r\ninattention and security, which is forever the fore-runner of\r\nslavery - They are alarmed at nothing so much, as attempts to awaken\r\nthe people to jealousy and watchfulness; and it has been an old game\r\nplayed over and over again, to hold up the men who would rouse their\r\nfellow citizens and countrymen to a sense of their real danger, and\r\nspirit them to the most zealous activity in the use of all proper\r\nmeans for the preservation of the public liberty, as \"pretended\r\npatriots,\" \"intemperate politicians,\" rash, hot-headed men,\r\nIncendiaries, wretched desperadoes, who, as was said of the best of\r\nmen, would turn the world upside down, or have done it already. -\r\nBut he must have a small share of fortitude indeed, who is put out\r\nof countenance by hard speeches without sense and meaning, or\r\naffrighted from the path of duty by the rude language of\r\nBillingsgate - For my own part, I smile contemptuously at such\r\nunmanly efforts: I would be glad to hear the reasoning of Chronus,\r\nif he has a capacity for it; but I disregard his railing as I would\r\nthe barking of a \"Cur dog\".\r\n\r\nThe dispassionate and rational Pennsylvania Farmer has told us, that\r\n\"a perpetual jealousy respecting liberty, is absolutely requisite in\r\nall free states.\" The unhappy experience of the world has frequently\r\nmanifested the truth of his observation. For want of this jealousy,\r\nthe liberties of Stain were destroyed by what is called a vote of\r\ncredit; that is, a confidence placed in the King to raise money upon\r\nextraordinary emergencies, in the intervals of parliament. France\r\nafterwards fell into the same snare; and England itself was in great\r\ndanger of it, in the reign of Charles the second; when a bill was\r\nbrought into the house of commons to enable the King to raise what\r\nmoney he pleased upon extraordinary occasions, as the dutch war was\r\npretended to be - And the scheme would doubtless have succeeded to\r\nthe ruin of the national liberty, had it not been for the\r\nwatchfulness of the \"intemperate patriots \", and \"wrong-headed\r\npoliticians\" even of that day.\r\n\r\nHow much better is the state of the American colonies soon likely to\r\nbe, than that of France and Spain or than Britain would have been\r\nin, if the Bill before mention'd had pass'd into an act? Does it\r\nmake any real difference whether one man has the sovereign disposal\r\nof the peoples purses, or five hundred? Is it not as certain that\r\nthe British parliament have assumed to themselves the power of\r\nraising what money they please in the colonies upon all occasions,\r\nas it is, that the Kings of France and Spain exercise the same power\r\nover their subjects upon emergencies? Those Kings by the way, being\r\nthe sole judges when emergencies happen, they generally create them\r\nas often as they want money. And what security have the colonies\r\nthat the British parliament will not do the same? It is dangerous to\r\nbe silent, as the ministerial writers would have us to be, while such\r\na claim is held up; but much more to submit to it. Your very silence,\r\nmy countrymen, may be construed a submission, and those who would\r\nperswade you to be quiet, intend to give it that turn. Will it be\r\nlikely then that your enemies, who have exerted every nerve to\r\nestablish a revenue, rais'd by virtue of a suppos'd inherent right in\r\nthe British parliament without your consent, will recede from the\r\nfavorite plan, when they imagine it to be compleated by your\r\nsubmission? Or if they should repeal the obnoxious act, upon the terms\r\nof your submitting to the right, is it not to be apprehended that your\r\nown submission will be brought forth as a precedent in a future time,\r\nwhen your watchful adversary shall have succeeded, and laid the most\r\nof you fast asleep in the bed of security and insensibility. Believe\r\nme, should the British parliament, which claims a right to tax you at\r\ndiscretion, ever be guided by a wicked and corrupt administration,\r\nand how near they are approaching to it, I will leave you to judge,\r\nyou will then find one revenue act succeeding another, till the\r\nfatal influence shall extend to your own parliaments. Bribes and\r\ntensions will be as frequent here, as they are in the unhappy\r\nkingdom of Ireland, and you and your posterity will be made, by\r\nmeans of your own money, as subservient to the will of a British\r\nministry, or an obsequious Governor, as the vassals of France are to\r\nthat of their grand monarch. What will prevent this misery and\r\ninfamy, but your being finally oblig'd to have recourse to the\r\nultima ratio! But is it probable that you will ever make any manly\r\nefforts to recover your liberty, after you have been inur'd, without\r\nany remorse, to contemplate yourselves as slaves? Custom, says the\r\nFarmer, gradually reconciles us to objects even of dread and\r\ndetestation. It reigns in nothing more arbitrarily than in publick\r\nAffairs. When an act injurious to freedom has once been done, and\r\nthe people bear it, the repetition of it is more likely to meet with\r\nsubmission. For as the mischief of the one was found to be\r\ntolerable, they will hope that the second will prove so too; and\r\nthey will not regard the infamy of the last, because they are\r\nstain'd with that of the first.\r\n\r\nThe beloved Patriot further observes, \"In mixed governments, the\r\nvery texture of their constitution demands a perpetual jealousy; for\r\nthe cautions with which power is distributed among the several\r\norders, imply, that each has that share which is proper for the\r\ngeneral welfare, and therefore that any further imposition must be\r\npernicious\". The government of this province, like that of Great\r\nBritain, of which it is said to be an epitome, is a mixed\r\ngovernment. It's constitution is delicately framed; and I believe\r\nall must acknowledge, that the power vested in the crown is full as\r\ngreat as is consistent with the general welfare. The King, by the\r\ncharter, has the nomination and appointment of the governor: But no\r\nmention being therein made of his right to take the payment of his\r\ngovernor upon himself, it is fairly concluded that the people have\r\nreserv'd that right to themselves, and the governor must stipulate\r\nwith them for his support. That this was the sense of the\r\ncontracting parties, appears from practice contemporary with the\r\ndate of the charter itself, which is the best exposition of it; and\r\nthe same practice has been continued uninterruptedly to the present\r\ntime - But the King now orders his support out of the American\r\nrevenue: Chronus himself, acknowledges that he is thereby \"render'd\r\nmore independent of the people.\" - Consequently the balance of power\r\nif it was before even is by this means disadjusted. Here then is\r\nanother great occasion of jealousy in the people. No reasonable man\r\nwill deny that an undue proportion of power added to the monarchical\r\npart of the constitution, is as dangerous, as the same undue\r\nproportion would be, if added to the democratical. Should the people\r\nrefuse to allow the governor the due exercise of the powers that are\r\nvested in him by the Charter, I dare say they would soon be told,\r\nand very justly, of \"the mischief that would be the consequence of\r\nit.\" And is there not the same reason why the people may and ought\r\nto speak freely & LOUDLY of the mischief which would be the\r\nconsequence of his being rendered more independent of them; or which\r\nis in reality the same thing, his becoming possessed of more power\r\nthan the charter vests him with? For the annihilating a\r\nconstitutional check, in the people, which is necessary to prevent\r\nthe Governor's exercise of exorbitant power, is in effect to enable\r\nhim to exercise that exorbitant power, when he pleases, without\r\ncontroul. A Governor legally appointed may usurp powers which do not\r\nbelong to him: And it is ten to one but he will, if the people are\r\nnot jealous and vigilant. Charles the first was legally appointed\r\nking: The doctrines advanced by the clergy in his father's infamous\r\nreign, led them both to believe that they were the LORD'S anointed\r\nand were not accountable for their conduct to the people. - It is\r\nstrange that kings seated on the English throne, should imbibe such\r\nopinions: But it is possible they were totally unacquainted with the\r\nhistory of their English predecessors. - Charles, by hearkening to\r\nthe council of his evil ministers, which coincided with the\r\nprinciples of his education, and his natural temper, and confiding\r\nin his corrupt judges, became an usurper of powers which he had no\r\nright to; and exercising those powers, he became a Tyrant: But the\r\nend proved fatal to him, and afforded a solemn lesson for all\r\nsucceeding usurpers and tyrants: His subjects who made him king,\r\ncalled him to account, dismiss'd and PUNISH'D him in a most\r\nexemplary manner! Charles was obstinate in his temper, and thought\r\nof nothing so little as concessions of any kind: If he had been well\r\nadvis'd, he would have renounced his usurped powers: Every wise\r\ngovernor will relinquish a power which is not clearly\r\nconstitutional, however inconsiderable those about him may perswade\r\nhim to think it; especially, if the people regard it as a PART\r\nOF A SYSTEM OF OPPRESSION, and AN EVIDENCE OF TYRANNICAL DESIGNS.\r\nAnd the more tenacious he is of it, the stronger is the reason why\r\n\"the SPIRIT OF APPREHENSION\" should be kept up among them in its\r\nutmost VIGILANCE.\r\n\r\nCANDIDUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE SIGNED \"CANDIDUS.\"\r\n\r\n[Boston Gazette, December 16, 1771.]\r\n\r\nMessieurs EDES & GILL,\r\n\r\nI Profess to be more generous than to make severe remarks upon the\r\napparent absurdities that run through the whole of Chronus's\r\nperformance in the last Massachusetts-Gazette. He tells us that \"he\r\nseldom examines political struggles that make their weekly\r\nappearance in the papers \". If by this mode of expression he means\r\nto inform us, that he seldom reads the papers with impartiality and\r\nattention, as every one ought, who designs to make his own\r\nobservations on them, I can easily believe him; for it is evident in\r\nthe piece now before me, that thro' a want of such impartiality or\r\ndue attention, to the political struggles which he examines, he\r\nmistakes one writer for another, and finds fault with Candidus for\r\nnot vindicating what had been advanc'd by Mutius Scaevola. I am no\r\nparty man, unless a firm attachment to the cause of Liberty and\r\nTruth will denominate one such: And if this be the judgment of those\r\nwho have taken upon themselves the character of Friends to the\r\nGovernment, I am content to be in their sense of the word a party\r\nman, and will glory in it as long as I shall retain that small\r\nportion of understanding which GOD has been pleas'd to bless me\r\nwith. If at any time I venture to lay my own opinions before the\r\npublic, which is the undoubted right of every one, I expect they\r\nwill be treated, if worth any notice, with freedom and candor: But I\r\ndo not think myself liable to be called to account by Chronus, or\r\nany one else, for not answering the objections they are pleased to\r\nmake to what is offered by another man, and not by me. Whatever may\r\nbe the opinion of Mr. Hutchinson, as a Usurper or a Tyrant or not,\r\nor as Governor or no Governor, if Chronus had fairly \"examined the\r\npolitical struggles\" which have appeared in the papers, he must have\r\nknown that I had not published my sentiments about the matter; I\r\nshall do it however, as soon as I think proper. - I would not\r\nwillingly suppose that Chronus artfully intended to amuse his\r\nreaders, and \"mislead them to believe \", that his address to the\r\npublick of the 28th of November, was particularly applicable to me,\r\nas having advanced the doctrine which has given so much disgust to\r\nsome gentlemen, and from whence he draws such a long string of\r\nterrible consequences. Whether the denying the governor's authority\r\nbe right or wrong, or whether upon Mutius's hypothesis it be\r\nvindicable or not, it is a \"maxim,\" (to use his own word) upon which\r\nit no more concerned me to pass my judgment than it did any other\r\nman in the community. Had Chronus then a right to press me into this\r\n\"political struggle,\" or to demand my opinion of what he had so\r\nsagely observed upon a subject which I had never engag'd in? Yes, by\r\nall means; says he, \"I pointed out some of the mischiefs that would\r\ninevitably follow upon denying the Governor's authority, if that\r\nmaxim should be generally received\"; and adds, \"what now has\r\nCandidus reply'd to all this? Why truly nothing, but - altum\r\nsilentium\" in English, a profound silence; that is in the words of\r\nan honest Teague on another occasion \"he answered and said nothing\"\r\n- But notwithstanding the deep silence that I preserv'd when I made\r\nmy answer, it seems that \"I assured him that the way of peaceable,\r\ndutiful and legal representations of our grievances had already been\r\ntried to no purpose\": With the most profound Taciturnity I \"was\r\npleas'd most largely to expatiate upon this point\", & with all my\r\n\"altum silentium\" my \"interrogations follow'd one another with such\r\namazing rapidity, that he (poor man) was almost out of breath in\r\nrepeating them.\" - Here, gentle reader, is presented to you a group\r\nof ideas in the chaste, the elegant style of CURONUS, which required\r\nmuch more skill in the English language than I am a master of, to\r\nreduce to the level of common sense. Thus I have given you a short\r\nspecimen of the taste of Chronus, who is said to be the top hand on\r\nthe side of the ministry: For want of leisure I must omit taking\r\nnotice of his \"method of reasoning\" till another time.\r\n\r\nCANDIDUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nDecbr 18 I771.\r\n\r\nThis day I waited on Mr Harrison Gray junr to acquaint him that I\r\nhad been informd that he had told John Hancock Esqr that he heard me\r\nsay in a threatning manner that Mr Hancock might think as he pleasd,\r\nMr Otis had friends & his (Mr Hancocks) treatment of Mr Otis would\r\nprejudice his (Mr Hancocks) Election. Mr Gray declard to me that he\r\ndid not hear me mention a Word of Mr Hancocks Election - that a\r\nconversation happend between Mr John Cotton & my self (Mr Gray being\r\npresent) relative to Mr Otis - that Mr Cotton said Mr Otis' Conduct\r\nmust be the Effect of Distraction or Drunkeness - that I said I did\r\nnot think so - but that it rather proceeded from Irritation - that\r\nhe (Mr Gray) said if Mr Otis is distracted why should Mr Hancock\r\npursue him - & that I answerd that Mr Hancock might be stirred up by\r\nothers to do it, but I thought he had better not or it was a pity he\r\nshould. This Mr Gray declared was all that I said relative to Mr\r\nHancock, in answer to his Question as is before mentiond & that it\r\ndid not appear to him that I discoverd the least Unfriendliness\r\ntowards Mr Hancock.

Those\r\n\"intemperate patriots\" it seems, the majority of both houses of the\r\ngeneral assembly, not hearkning to the cool advice of the few wise\r\nmen within and without doors, must needs make their humble\r\nrepresentations to the King and Council upon the claims of New-\r\nHampshire and Rhode-Island: And what was the consequence? Why, he\r\nsays the province lost ten times the value of the land in dispute.\r\nDid Chronus mean by this and such like instances, to enforce the\r\nmeasure which he had recommended? They certainly afford a poor\r\nencouragement for us to persevere in the way of petitioning and\r\nhumble representation. But perhaps he will say, the General Assembly\r\nhad at that time no reason to complain of the incroachment of these\r\nsister colonies their claims were just; and the discerning few who\r\nwere in that mind were in the right. Just so he says is the case\r\nnow. For he tells us that \"no one has attempted to infringe the\r\npeoples rights.\" Upon what principle then would he have us petition?\r\nIt is possible, for I would fain understand him, that what Candidus\r\nand others call an invasion of our rights, he may choose to\r\ndenominate a Grievance; for if we suffer no Grievance, he can\r\ncertainly have no reason to advise us to represent the hardship of\r\ncertain measures. And I am the rather inclin'd to think, that this\r\nis his particular humour, because I find that the stamp-act, which\r\nalmost every one looked upon as a most violent infraction of our\r\nnatural and constitutional rights, is called by this writer a\r\nGrievance. And he is so singular as to enquire, \"What Liberties we\r\nare now deprived of,\" aitho' an act of parliament is still in being,\r\nand daily executed, very similar to the stamp-act, and form'd for\r\nthe very same purpose, viz, the raising and establishing a revenue\r\nin the colonies by virtue of a suppos'd inherent right in the\r\nBritish parliament, where the colonies cannot be represented, and\r\ntherefore without their consent. The exercise of such a power\r\nChronus would have us consider as a Grievance indeed, but not by any\r\nmeans a deprivation of our rights and liberties, or even so much as\r\nthe least infringement of them. Mr. Locke has often been quoted in\r\nthe present dispute between Britain and her colonies, and very much\r\nto our purpose. His reasoning is so forcible, that no one has even\r\nattempted to confute it. He holds that \"the preservation of property\r\nis the end of government, and that for which men enter into society.\r\nIt therefore necessarily supposes and requires that the people\r\nshould have property, without which they must be suppos'd to lose\r\nthat by entering into society, which was the end for which they\r\nenter'd into it; too gross an absurdity for any man to own. Men\r\ntherefore in society having property, they have such a right to the\r\ngoods, which by the law of the community are theirs, that no body\r\nhath the right to take any part of their subsistence from them\r\nwithout their consent: Without this, they could have no property at\r\nall. For I truly can have no property in that which another can by\r\nright take from me when he pleases, against my consent. Hence, says\r\nhe, it is a mistake to think that the supreme power of any\r\ncommonwealth can dispose of the estates of the subjects arbitrarily,\r\nor take any part of them at pleasure. The prince or senate can never\r\nhave a power to take to themselves the whole or any part of the\r\nsubjects property without their own consent; for this would be in\r\neffect to have no property at all.\" - This is the reasoning of that\r\ngreat and good man. And is not our own case exactly described by\r\nhim? Hath not the British parliament made an act to take a part of\r\nour property against our consent? Against our repeated submissive\r\npetitions and humble representations of the hardship of it? Is not\r\nthe act daily executed in every colony? If therefore the\r\npreservation of property is the very end of government, we are\r\ndepriv'd of that for which government itself is instituted. - Tis\r\ntrue, says Mr. Locke, \"Government cannot be supported without great\r\ncharge; and tis fit that every one who enjoys a share in the\r\nprotection should pay his proportion for the maintenance of it. But\r\nstill it must be with their own consent, given by themselves or\r\ntheir representatives.\" Chronus will not say that the monies that\r\nare every day paid at the custom-houses in America for the express\r\npurpose of maintaining all or any of the Governors therein, were\r\nrais'd with the consent of those who pay them, given by themselves\r\nor their representatives - \"If any one, adds Mr. Locke, shall claim\r\na power to lay and levy taxes on the people by his own authority &\r\nwithout such consent of the people, he thereby subverts the end of\r\ngovernment.\" - Will Chronus tell us that the British parliament doth\r\nnot claim authority to lay and levy such taxes, and doth not\r\nactually lay and levy them on the colonies without their consent?\r\nThis is the case particularly in this province. If therefore it is a\r\nsubversion of the end of government, it must be a subversion of our\r\ncivil liberty, which is supported by civil government only. And this\r\nI think a sufficient answer to a strange question which Chronus\r\nthinks it \"not improper for our zealous Patriots to answer, viz.\r\nWhat those liberties and rights are of which we have been deprived.\r\n- If Chronus is really as ignorant as he pretends to be, of the\r\npresent state of the colonies, their universal and just complaints\r\nof the most violent infractions of their liberties, and their\r\nrepeated petitions to the throne upon that account, I hope I shall\r\nbe excused in taking up any room in your valuable paper, with a view\r\nof answering a question, which to him must be of the utmost\r\nimportance. - But if he is not, I think his question not only\r\nimpertinent, but a gross affront to the understanding of the public.\r\nWe have lost the constitutional right which the Commons of America\r\nin their several Assemblies have ever before possessed, of giving\r\nand granting their own money, as much of it as they please, and no\r\nmore; and appropriating it for the support of their own government,\r\nfor their own defence, and such other purposes as they please. The\r\ngreat Mr. Pitt, in his speech in parliament in favor of the repeal\r\nof the stamp-act, declared that \"we should have been slaves if we\r\nhad not enjoy'd this right.\" This is the sentiment of that patriotic\r\nmember, and it is obvious to the comnmon sense of every man. -If the\r\nparliament have a right to take as much of our money as they please,\r\nthey may take all. And what liberty can that man have, the produce\r\nof whose daily labour another has the right to take from him if he\r\npleases, and which is similar to our case, takes a part of it to\r\nconvince him that he has the power as well as the pretence of right?\r\n- That sage of the law Lord Camden declar'd, in his speech upon the\r\ndeclaratory bill, that \"his searches had more and more convinced him\r\nthat the British parliament have no right to tax the Americans. Nor,\r\nsaid he, \"is the doctrine new: It is as old as the constitution:\r\nIndeed, it is its support.\" The taking away this right must then be\r\nin the opinion of that great lawyer, the removal of the very support\r\nof the constitution, upon which all our civil liberties depend. He\r\nspeaks in still stronger terms-\" Taxation and representation are\r\ninseparably united: This position is founded on the laws of nature:\r\nIt is more: It is itself an eternal law of nature - Whatever is a\r\nman's own is absolutely his own; and no man has a right to take it\r\nfrom him without his consent, either express'd by himself or his\r\nrepresentative - Whoever attempts to do it, attempts an injury:\r\nWhoever does it, commits a ROBBERY: He throws down the distinction\r\nbetween liberty and slavery\" - Can Chronus say, that the Americans\r\never consented either by themselves or their representatives, that\r\nthe British parliament should tax them? That they have taxed us we\r\nall know: We all feel it: I wish we felt it more sensibly: They have\r\ntherefore, according to the sentiments of the last mention'd\r\nNobleman, which are built on nature and common reason, thrown down\r\nthe very distinction between liberty and slavery in America - And\r\nyet this writer. like one just awoke from a long dream, or, as I\r\ncannot help thinking there are good grounds to suspect, with a\r\ndesign to \"mislead his unwary readers (and unwary they must needs\r\nbe, if they are thus misled,) to believe that all our liberties are\r\nperfectly secure, he calls upon us to show \"which of our liberties\r\nwe are deprived of;\" and in the face of a whole continent, as well\r\nas of the best men in Europe, he has the effrontery to assert,\r\nwithout the least shadow of argument, that \"no one has attempted to\r\ninfringe them.\" One cannot after all this, be at a loss to conceive,\r\nwhat judgment to form of his modesty, his understanding or\r\nsincerity.\r\n\r\nIt might be easy to show that there are other instances in which we\r\nare deprived of our liberties. - I should think, a people would\r\nhardly be perswaded to believe that they were in the full enjoyment of\r\ntheir liberties, while their capital fortress is garrison'd by troops\r\nover which they have no controul, and under the direction of an\r\nadministration in whom, to say the least, they have no reason to place\r\nthe smallest confidence that they shall be employ'd for their\r\nprotection, and not as they have been for their destruction - While\r\nthey have a governor absolutely independent of them for his support,\r\nwhich support as well as his political being - depends upon that same\r\nadministration, tho' at the expence of their own money taken from them\r\nagainst their consent - While their governor acts not according to the\r\ndictates of his own judgment, assisted by the constitutional advice of\r\nhis council, if he thinks it necessary to call for it, but according\r\nto the edicts of such an administration - Will it mend the matter that\r\nthis governor, thus dependent upon the crown, is to be the judge of\r\nthe legality of instructions and their consistency with the Charter,\r\nwhich is the constitution? Or if their present governor should be\r\npossess'd of as many angelic properties as we have heard of in the\r\nlate addresses, can they enjoy that tranquility of mind arising from\r\ntheir sense of safety, which Montesquieu defines to be civil\r\nliberty, when they consider how precarious a person a provincial\r\ngovernor is, especially a good one? And how likely a thing it is, if\r\nhe is a good one, that another may soon be placed in his stead,\r\npossessed of the principles of the Devil, who for the sake of\r\nholding his commission which is even now pleaded as a weighty motive,\r\nwill execute to the full the orders of an abandon'd minister, to the\r\nruin of those liberties which we are told are now so secure - Will a\r\npeople be perswaded that their liberties are safe, while their\r\nrepresentatives in general assembly, if they are ever to meet\r\nagain, will be deprived of the most essential privilege of giving\r\nand granting what part of their own money they are yet allowed to\r\ngive and grant, unless, in conformity to a ministerial instruction\r\nto the governor, solemnly read to them for their direction, they\r\nexempt the commissioners of the customs, or any other favorites or\r\ntools of the ministry, from their equitable share in the tax? All\r\nthese and many others that might be mention'd, are the natural\r\neffects of that capital cause of complaint of all North-America,\r\nwhich, to use the language of those \"intemperate patriots \", the\r\nmajority of the present assembly, is \" a subjugation to as\r\narbitrary a TRIBUTE as ever the Romans laid upon the Jews, or\r\ntheir other colonies\" - What now is the advice of Chronus? Why,\r\n\"much may be done, says he, by humble petitions and\r\nrepresentations of the hardships of certain measures\" - Ask him\r\nwhether the colonies have not already done it? Whether the\r\nassembly of this province, the convention, the town of Boston,\r\nhave not petitioned and humbly represented the hardship of certain\r\nmeasures, and all to no purpose, and he tells you either that he\r\nis \"a stranger to those  petitions\", or \"that they were not duly\r\ntimed, or properly urged,\" or \"that the true reason why ALL our\r\npetitions and representations met with no better success was,\r\nbecause they were accompanied with a conduct quite the reverse of\r\nthat submission and duty which they seem'd to express\" - that \"to\r\npresent a petition with one hand, while the other is held up in a\r\nthreatning posture to enforce it, is not the way to succeed\" -\r\nSearch for his meaning, and enquire when the threatning hand was\r\nheld up, and you'll find him encountering the Resolves of the Town\r\nof Boston to maintain their Rights, (in which they copied after\r\nthe patriotic Assemblies of the several Colonies) and their\r\nInstructions to their Representatives. Here is the sad source of\r\nall our difficulties. - Chronus would have us petition, and humbly\r\nrepresent the hardships of certain measures, but we must by no\r\nmeans assert our Liberties. We must acknowledge, at least tacitly,\r\nthat the Parliament of Great Britain has a constitutional\r\nauthority, \"to throw down the distinction between Liberty and\r\nslavery\" in America. We may indeed, humbly represent it as a\r\nhardship, but if they are resolved to execute the purpose, we must\r\nsubmit to it, without the least intimation to posterity, that we\r\nlook'd upon it as unconstitutional or unjust. Such advice was\r\nsagely given to the Colonists a few years ago, at second hand, by\r\none who had taken a trip to the great city, and grew wonderfully\r\nacquainted, as he said, with Lord Hillsborough; but his foibles\r\nare now \"buried under the mantle of charity.\" Very different was\r\nhis advice from that of another of infinitely greater abilities,\r\nas well as experience in the public affairs of the nation, and the\r\ncolonies: I mean Doctor Benjamin Franklin, the present agent of\r\nthe House of Representatives. His last letter to his constituents,\r\nas I am well informed, strongly recommends the holding up our\r\nconstitutional Rights, by frequent Resolves, &c. This we know will\r\nbe obnoxious to those who are in the plan to enslave us: But\r\nremember my countrymen, it will be better to have your liberties\r\nwrested from you by force, than to have it said that you even\r\nimplicitly surrendered them.\r\n\r\nI have something more to say to Chronus when leisure will admit of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nCANDIDUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HENRY MARCHANT.1\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON Jan 7 1772\r\n\r\nSIR\r\n\r\nI wrote you soon after your departure from hence but am lately\r\ninformd by Mr F. Dana that you have not receivd my Letter; he has\r\nput me in the way of a more sure direction under an Inclosure to\r\nMess Trecothick & Apthorp.\r\n\r\nBy our last Vessells from London we have an Account of the Choice\r\nof Mr Nash for the Lord Mayor, & that he was brot in by\r\nministerial Influence. It gives great Concern to the Friends of\r\nLiberty here that any Administration much more such as the present\r\nappears to be, should have an Ascendency in the important\r\nElections of that City, which has heretofore by her Independency &\r\nIncorruption been the great Security of the Freedom of the nation.\r\nIt is questionable however\r\n\r\n1 Attorney-General of Rhode Island. The letter was addressed to\r\nMarchant at London, where he was acting as the agent of Rhode\r\nIsland. He left Rhode Island in July, 1771, and returned in the\r\nautumn of 1772. Cf., Records of the Colony of Rhode Island, vol. vii.,\r\npp. 27-31, 197.\r\n\r\nwhether the Ministry would have gaind their point, if they had not\r\naccording to the Machiavellian plan accomplishd a Division among\r\nthose who profess to be Patriots. The same Art is now practicd by\r\ntheir Tools & Dependents on this side the Water. They have been\r\nendeavoring to excite a Jealousy among the Colonies, each one of\r\nthe others, & in a great measure brought it about by the\r\nunfortunate failure of the Nonimportation Agreement. Perhaps every\r\nColony was faulty in that matter in some degree but neither chose\r\nto take any of the Blame of it to its self, & to shift it off each\r\ncast the whole upon the others. The Truth is there were so many of\r\nthe Merchants under the Court Influence in all of them as that\r\nthey were able to defeat the plan, & for that Reason I was\r\ndoubtful from the beginning of the Success of it. The Agents of\r\nthe Ministry have since been trying to perswade the people to\r\nbelieve that they are sick of their measures & would be glad to\r\nrecede, but cannot consistent with their own honor while the\r\nColonies are clamoring against them - they would therefore have us\r\nto be quite silent as tho we enjoyd our Rights & Liberties to the\r\nfull, & trust that those who have discoverd the greatest\r\nperseverance in every Measure to enslave us, will of their own\r\nAccord & without the least Necessity give up their Design. This\r\nsoothing & dangerous Doctrine I fear has had an effect in some of\r\nthe Colonies, but I am in hopes that those who have been ready to\r\ntrust to the false promises of Courtiers begin to see through the\r\nDelusion. It was impossible that many persons could be catchd in\r\nsuch a Snare in this province, where absolute Despotism appears to\r\nbe continually making large Strides with barefaced Impudence. It\r\nwill not be easy to convince this people that the Ministry have in\r\ntheir hearts any favor towards them, while they are taking their\r\nmoney out of their pockets, & appropriating it for the maintenance\r\nof a Governor who because of his absolute Dependence upon them\r\nwill always yield obedience to their Instructions, and a standing\r\nArmy in their Capital fortress, over which that Governor I presume\r\nto say dares not exercise any Authority, tho invested with it by\r\nthe Charter, without express Leave from his Masters.\r\nAdministration must be strangely blind indeed, or they must think\r\nus the most foolish and ductile people under Heaven (in which they\r\nare greatly mistaken) to imagine that in such a Condition we are\r\nto be flatterd with hopes of any kind Disposition of theirs\r\ntowards us. The Governor & other Friends to the Ministry or rather\r\nfriends to themselves would fain have it thought in England, that\r\nthe People in general are easy & contented or to use the Words of\r\nhis Speech at the opening of the last Session, that they are\r\nreturnd to Good order & Government1 this may tend to establish him\r\nin his Seat as one who can carry the most favorite points but\r\nNothing can afford greater Evidence to the Contrary than the\r\ngeneral Contempt and Indignation with which his proclamation for\r\nan annual Thanksgiving was treated, because we were therein\r\nexhorted to return Thanks to Almighty God that \"our religious &\r\ncivil privileges were continued to us\" & that \"our Trade was\r\nenlargd\" - It is said & I believe it to be a fact, that full two\r\nthirds of the congregational Clergy refusd to read the proclamation, &\r\nperhaps not more of them than appeard the last Spring in favor [of]\r\nthe pompous congratulatory Address, that is not a Sixth part of them\r\ntook any notice of those Clauses in the religious Services of the\r\nday. It is for the Interest of the Crown Officers here who are\r\ndependent upon the Ministers to make them believe that they have\r\nby their Art & policy reconciled the people to their Measures, &\r\nif the Nation is so far misled as to believe so, the Ministry may\r\navail themselves of it, but if the Contrary should happen to be\r\ntrue, as it appears to me to be, such Events may sooner than we\r\nare aware of it take place, as may afford the Nation Grounds to\r\nrepent of her Credulity. It may be thought arrogant for an\r\nAmerican thus to express himself, but let Britain consider that\r\nher own & her Colonies dependence is at present mutual which may\r\nnot & probably will not be the Case in some hereafter. Why should\r\neither side hasten on the alarming Crisis. I am a friend to both,\r\nbut I confess my friendship to the latter is the most ardent -\r\nthey have in time past and if by the severe treatment which the\r\nColonies have receivd, Confidence in the Mother Country is not in\r\ntoo great a Degree lost, they may still for some time to come\r\nadminister to each others Happiness & Grandeur. This in my humble\r\nOpinion greatly depends upon a Change of Ministers & Measures\r\nwhich it is not in my power & I presume not in yours however\r\nearnestly we both may desire it, to accomplish.\r\n\r\nI wait in daily Expectation of a Letter from you.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 May 30, 1771. Massachusetts State Papers, p. 300.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ARTHUR LEE.\r\n\r\n[R. H. Lee, Life of Arthur Lee, vol. ii., pp., 189-192; a draft is\r\nin the Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, January 14th, 1772.\r\n\r\nSIR, -\r\n\r\nYour latest letter to me is of the 10th June,1 since which I have\r\nseveral times written to you and have been impatiently waiting for\r\nyour farther favours. I suppose by this time the parliament is\r\nsitting for the despatch of business, and we shall soon discover\r\nwhether administration have had it in their hearts, as we have\r\nbeen flattered, to recede from their oppressive measures, and\r\nrepeal the obnoxious revenue acts. Is it not a strange mode of\r\nexpression of late years made use of, that administration intends\r\nthat this law shall be enacted, or that repealed? It is language\r\nadapted to the infamy of the present times, by a nation which\r\nboasts of the freedom and independency of her parliaments. I\r\nbelieve almost any of the American assemblies would highly resent\r\nsuch an imperious tone, even in the honourable board of\r\ncommissioners of the customs, who I dare say think themselves\r\nequal in dignity, at least in proportion to the different\r\ncountries, to his majesty's ministers of state. A Bostonian, I\r\nassure you, would blush with indignation to hear it said that his\r\nmajesty's commissioners of the customs (though perhaps they are of\r\nhis excellency's privy council) had held a consultation at\r\nButcher's Hall, upon the affairs of the province, and that they\r\nhad come to a conclusion that the house of representatives should\r\nrescind their late protest against any doctrines which tend to give\r\nroyal instructions to the governor, the force of laws. This protest it\r\nis said, his majesty's wise ministers were so hugely affronted at,\r\nas to alter their determination upon a question, in which the fate\r\nof the British nation was involved, namely, whether our general\r\nassembly should sit at Cambridge or in Boston. I confess this was\r\na question of such astonishing importance to the millions of\r\nBritons and their descendants, and decided no doubt with such\r\nrefined discrimination of judgment, that is not so much to be\r\nwondered at, if all national wisdom is to be ascribed to such a\r\nbed of counsellors, who seem to have possessed themselves of all\r\nnational power. But as the circumstances of things may alter, and\r\nhis majesty may be obliged through necessity to have recourse to\r\nmen of common understanding, when these are gone to receive their\r\njust rewards in another life, would it not be most proper that the\r\nparliament should be at least the ostensive legislature, for there\r\nis danger in precedents, and in time to come the supreme power of\r\nthe nation may be the dupes of a ministry, who may have no more\r\nunderstanding than themselves. It has been said that the king's\r\nministers have for years past received momentary hints respecting\r\nthe fabrication of American revenue laws and other regulations,\r\nfrom some very wise heads on this side of the water, and\r\nparticularly of this place; and perhaps Great Britain may be more\r\nindebted to some Bostonians or residents in Boston than she may\r\nimagine, however reproachfully she may have spoken of them.\r\nBernard publicly declared that he did not obtrude his advice on\r\nhis majesty's ministers unasked; and therefore we may naturally\r\nconclude that my lord of Hillsborough, (sublime as his\r\nunderstanding is) the minister in the department, stood in need of\r\nand asked his advice, when the baronet journalized the necessary\r\nmeasures of administration for the colonies, which he retailed in\r\nweekly and sometimes daily letters to his lordship. On his\r\ndeparture he recommended Mr Hutchinson, though a Bostonian, \"born\r\nand educated\" as one upon whom his lordship might depend as much\r\nas upon himself; and in this one thing I believe Bernard wrote the\r\ntruth, for if they have not equal merit for their faithful\r\nservices to administration, Mr. Hutchinson, I verily believe, has\r\nthe greatest share. It is whispered here that the honourable board\r\nof commissioners have represented to administration that the\r\npresent revenue is not sufficient to answer all demands, which are\r\ndaily increasing, and therefore it will be necessary for their\r\nlordships to establish an additional fund. This is an important\r\nhint, which may relieve their lordships, unless a new manoeuvre\r\nshould succeed, of which we have an account in the Boston Gazette\r\nenclosed. By a vessel just arrived from London, the friends of\r\ngovernment, as they call themselves, pretend that they have\r\ncertain assurances from administration, that in three months we\r\nshall not be troubled with commissioners or standing armies. This,\r\nif we could depend upon court promises, would afford an agreeable\r\nprospect. But the root of all our grievances is the parliament's\r\ntaxing us, which they cannot do, but upon principles repugnant to\r\nand subversive of our constitution. If their lordships, the\r\nministry, would be pleased to repeal the revenue acts, they would\r\nstrike a blow at the root.\r\n\r\nThe grand design of our adversaries is to lull us into security,\r\nand make us easy while the acts remain in force, which would prove\r\nfatal to us.\r\n\r\nI have written in great haste, and am sincerely your friend and\r\nhumble servant,\r\n\r\n\r\n1 R. H. Lee, Life of Arthur Lee, vol. i., pp. 215-219.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE SIGNED \"CANDIDUS.\"\r\n\r\n[Boston Gazette, January 20, 1772.]\r\n\r\nMessieurs EDES & GILL,\r\n\r\nIN the Massachusetts-Gazette of the 9th instant, Chronus attempts\r\nto prove that \"the Parliament's laying duties upon trade, for the\r\nexpress purpose of raising a revenue, is not repugnant to and\r\nsubversive of our constitution.\" In defence of this proposition,\r\nhe proceeds to consider the nation as commercial, and from thence\r\nto show the necessity of laws for the regulation of trade. - In\r\nthe nation he includes Great-Britain and all the Colonies, and\r\ninfers that these acts for the regulation of trade, \"should extend\r\nto all the British dominions, to prevent one part of the national\r\nbody from injuring another.\" And, says he, \"If laws for the\r\nregulation of trade are necessary, who so proper to enact them,\r\n&c. as the British parliament, or to dispose of the fines &\r\nforfeitures arising from the breach of such acts?\" And then he tells\r\nus, that as a number of preventive officers will hereupon become\r\nnecessary, the parliament have thought proper to assign to his\r\nMajesty's revenue \"the profits arising on the duties of importation\r\nfor the payment of those officers \". This is Chronus's \"method of\r\nreasoning \", to prove that because it is necessary that the parliament\r\nshould enact laws for the regulation of trade, about which there has\r\nas yet been no dispute that I know of, and because it is proper that\r\nsuch preventive officers as shall be found needful to carry those\r\nlaws into execution, should be paid out of the fines and\r\nforfeitures arising from the breach of them, Therefore, the\r\nparliament hath a right to make laws imposing duties or taxes, for\r\nthe express purpose of raising a revenue in the colonies without\r\ntheir consent; and that this is not (as is alledg'd by our\r\nPatriots \") \"repugnant to or subversive of our constitution \".\r\nEvery one may easily see how Chronus evades the matter in dispute,\r\nand aims at amusing his readers according to his usual manner, by\r\nendeavouring, and that without a shadow of argument, to prove one\r\npoint, instead of another which is quite distinct from it, and\r\nwhich he ought to prove, but cannot. He is indeed sensible that\r\nhis artifice is seen through; that it will be urged that \"he has\r\nevaded the chief difficulties,\" and that \"the objection doth not\r\nlie against the regulation of trade, but against the imposing\r\nduties for the express purpose of raising a revenue.\" And he is\r\nfull ready to remove this objection. But how? Why, by asking a\r\nquestion, which he often substitutes in the room of argument. Are\r\nwe not, says he, \"fellow-subjects with our brethren at home, and\r\nconsequently bound to bear a part according to our ability, in\r\nsupporting the honor & dignity of the crown?\" It is allow'd that\r\nwe are the subjects of the same prince with our brethren at home,\r\nand are in duty bound, as far as we are able, to support the honor\r\nand dignity of our Sovereign, while he affords us his protection.\r\nBut does Chronus from thence infer an obligation on us to yield\r\nobedience to the acts of the British parliament imposing taxes\r\nupon us with the express intention of raising a revenue, to be\r\nappropriated for such purposes as that legislative thinks proper,\r\nwithout our consent? 0, says he, \"there is good reason for this.\"\r\nWhat is the good reason? Why \"if we will not consent to do\r\nanything ourselves \", \"our money will be taken from us without our\r\nconsent.\" This is conclusive argument indeed. And then he, as it\r\nwere, imperceptibly glides into that which has ever appeared to be\r\nhis favorite topick, however impertinent to the present point,\r\nviz, an independent support for the governor. He boldly affirms,\r\nwhat is a notorious untruth, that \"we are unwilling to pay his\r\nMajesty's substitute in such a manner as should leave him that\r\nfreedom and independency which is necessary to his station, and\r\nwith which he is vested by the constitution:\" And therefore the\r\nparliament hath a right to enable his Majesty to pay his\r\nsubstitute, out of a revenue extorted from us against our consent.\r\nIf his premises were well grounded, his conclusion would not\r\nfollow: And the question would still remain, to which Chronus has\r\nnot attempted to give any rational answer, namely, By what\r\nauthority doth the parliament these things, and who gave them this\r\nauthority? Thus we still continue to dispute the authority of the\r\nparliament to lay duties and taxes upon us, with the express\r\npurpose of raising a revenue, as \"repugnant to, and subversive of\r\nour constitution;\" and for a reason which I dare say Chronus will\r\nnever get over, namely, because as he himself allows,\" we are not\r\nrepresented in it.\" -\r\n\r\nThe English constitution, says Baron Montesquieu, has Liberty for\r\nits direct object: And the constitution of this province, as our\r\nown historian,1 informs us, is an epitome of the British\r\nconstitution; and it undoubtedly has the same end for its object:\r\nWhatever laws therefore are made for our government, either in a\r\nmanner, or for purposes subversive of Liberty, must be subversive\r\nof the end of the constitution, and consequently of the\r\nconstitution itself. -  No free people, as the Pennsylvania Farmer\r\nhas observed, ever existed, or ever can exist without, to use a\r\ncommon but strong expression, keeping the purse-strings in their\r\nhands: But the parliament's laying taxes on the Colonies for the\r\nexpress purpose of raising a revenue, takes the purse strings out\r\nof their hands, and consequently it is \"repugnant to, and\r\nsubversive of (the end of) our constitution \"-Liberty. Mr. Locke\r\nsays, that the security of property is the end for which men enter\r\ninto society; and I believe Chronus will not deny it: Whatever\r\nlaws therefore are made in any society, tending to render property\r\ninsecure, must be subversive of the end for which men prefer\r\nsociety to the state of nature; and consequently must be\r\nsubversive of society itself:\r\n\r\nBut the parliament in which the Colonies have no voice, taking as\r\nmuch of their money as it pleases, and appropriating it to such\r\npurposes as it pleases, even against their consent, and as they\r\nthink repugnant to their safety, renders all their property\r\nprecarious, and therefore it is subversive of the end for which\r\nmen enter into society and repugnant to every free constitution. -\r\nMr. Hooker in his ecclesiastical polity, as quoted by Mr. Locke,\r\naffirms that \"Laws they are not, which the public approbation hath\r\nnot made so.\" This seems to be the language of nature and common\r\nsense; for if the public are bound to yield obedience to the laws,\r\nto which they cannot give their approbation, they are slaves to\r\nthose who make such laws and enforce them: But the acts of\r\nparliament imposing duties, with the express purpose of raising a\r\nrevenue in the colonies, have received every mark of the public\r\ndisapprobation in every colony; and yet they are enforced in all,\r\nand in some with the utmost rigour. The British constitution\r\nhaving liberty for its object, is so framed, as that every man who\r\nis to be bound by any law about to be made, may be present by his\r\nrepresentative in parliament, who may employ the whole force of\r\nhis objections against it, if he cannot approve of it: If after\r\nfair debate, it is approv'd of by the majority of the whole\r\nrepresentative body of the nation, the minority, by a rule\r\nessential in society, and without which it could not subsist, is\r\nbound to submit to it: But the colonies had no voice in parliament\r\nwhen the revenue acts were made; nay, though they had no\r\nrepresentatives there, their petitions were rejected, because they\r\nwere against duties to be laid on; and they have been called factious,\r\nfor the objections they made, not only against their being taxed\r\nwithout their consent, which was a sufficient objection, but against\r\nthe appropriation of the money when rais'd to purposes which as the\r\nFarmer has made to appear, will supersede the authority in our\r\nrespective assemblies, which is most essential to liberty.\r\nRepresentation and Legislation, as well as taxation, are inseparable,\r\naccording to the spirit of our constitution; and of all others that\r\nare free. Human foresight is incapable of providing against every\r\naccident. A small part of the nation may be \"at sea, as Chronus tells\r\nus, when writs are issued out for the election of members of\r\nparliament\"; and to admit that they, after their return \"should be\r\nexempt from any acts of parliament, the members of which were chosen\r\nin their absence \", would be attended with greater evil to the\r\ncommunity, the safety and welfare of which is the end of all\r\nlegislation, than the misfortune of their voluntary absence, if it\r\nshould prove one, could be to them. I say, if it should prove a\r\nmisfortune to them; for those acts being made by the consent of\r\nrepresentatives chosen by all the rest of the nation, it is presum'd\r\nthey are calculated for the good of the whole, of which they, as a\r\npart, must necessarily partake: But the supposed case of these persons\r\nis far different from that of the colonists; who are, not by a\r\nvoluntary choice of their own, but through necessity, not by mere\r\naccident, but by means of the local distance of their constant\r\nresidence, excluded from being present by representation in the\r\nBritish legislature. Chronus allows that by means of their distance,\r\n\"they are become incapable of exercising their original right of\r\nchoosing representatives for the British parliament.\" If so, they\r\ncannot without subversion of the end of the British constitution, be\r\nbound to obedience, against their own consent, to such laws as are\r\nthere made; especially such laws as tend to render precarious their\r\nproperty, the security of which is the end of men's entering into\r\nsociety. If they are thus bound, they are slaves and not free men: But\r\nslavery must certainly be \"repugnant to the constitution\" which has\r\nliberty for its direct object. If the supreme legislative of Great\r\nBritain, cannot consistently with the British constitution or the\r\nessential liberty of the colonies, make laws binding upon them, and\r\nChronus for ought I can see, has not attempted to make it rationally\r\nappear that it can, it is dangerous for the colonies to admit any\r\nof its laws. For however upright some may think the present\r\nparliament to be, in intention, they may ruin us through mistake\r\narising from an incurable ignorance of our circumstances; and\r\nthough Chronus may be so singular as to judge the present revenue\r\nacts of parliament binding upon the colonies, to be salutary, the\r\ntime may perhaps come, when even he may be convinced, that future\r\nones may be oppressive and tyrannical, not only in their\r\nexecution, but in the very intention of those that may make them.\r\n\r\nChronus says, that \"he has all along taken it for granted, that\r\nthe kingdom and the colonies are one dominion.\" If so he must\r\nallow the colonies to take it for granted that they have an equal\r\nshare with the inhabitants of Britain in the rights belonging to\r\nthis one dominion, and particularly in the cardinal right of being\r\nrepresented in the supreme legislature. But that right, he says,\r\nthey are \"incapable of exercising,\" by reason of their distance.\r\nWe all agree in this, and it is not their fault? Why then should\r\nthey not have the right of legislating for themselves, as well as\r\nthat other part of this one dominion? Why truly, we have \"a right\r\nof choosing an assembly, which with the concurrence of his\r\nMajesty's Governor, hath a power of enacting local statutes,\r\nestablishing taxes, &c. - Yet still in subordination to the\r\ngeneral laws of the empire, reserving the full right of supremacy\r\n& dominion, which are in themselves unalienable.\" If I understand\r\nhis meaning in this dark expression, it is this, we have a right\r\nof choosing an assembly, but this assembly is controulable in all\r\nits acts, by another assembly which we have no right to choose,\r\nand which has this right of controul in itself unalienable. But\r\nthe question still recurs, How came this right to be in the\r\nBritish parliament? Chronus says that \"admitting that we are all\r\none dominion, there is, and must be, a supreme, irresistible,\r\nabsolute, uncontrouled authority, in which must reside the power\r\nof making and establishing laws,\" \"and all others must conform to\r\nit, and be govern'd by it\". But if we are all one dominion; or if\r\nI understand him, the members of one state, tho' so remotely\r\nsituated, the kingdom from the Colonies, as that we cannot all\r\npartake of the rights of the supreme Legislature, why may not this\r\n\"irresistible, absolute, uncontrouled,\" and controuling\r\n\"authority, in which the jura summi imperii, or the rights of the\r\ngovernment reside\", be established in America, or in Ireland, as well\r\nas in Britain. Is there any thing in nature, or has Ireland or America\r\nconsented that the part of this one dominion called Britain shall\r\nbe thus distinguished? Or are we to infer her authority from her\r\npower? But it must be, and Chronus gives us no other reason for it\r\nthan his bare affirmation, that \"the King, Lords and Commons of\r\nGreat-Britain form the supreme Legislature of the British\r\ndominions\". And he adds, \"to say that each of the Colonies had\r\nwithin itself a supreme independent Legislature, and that\r\nnevertheless the kingdom and the Colonies are all one dominion, is\r\na solecism:\" Let him then view the Kingdom and the Colonies in\r\nanother light, and see whether there will be a solecism in\r\nconsidering them as more dominions than one, or separate states.\r\nIt is certainly more concordant with the great law of nature and\r\nreason, which the most powerful nation may not violate and cannot\r\nalter, to suppose that the Colonies are separate independent and\r\nfree, than to suppose that they must be one with Great-Britain and\r\nslaves. And slaves they must be, notwithstanding all which Chronus\r\nhas said to the contrary, if Great Britain may make all laws\r\nwhatsoever binding upon them, especially laws to take from them\r\nwhat portions of their property she pleases, without and against\r\ntheir consent.\r\n\r\nI shall make further remarks upon Chronus, when I shall be at\r\nleisure.\r\n\r\nCANDIDUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Mr. Hutchinson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE SIGNED \"CANDIDUS.\"\r\n\r\n[Boston Gazette, January 27, 1772; a complete draft of this article\r\nis in the Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nMessieurs EDES & GILL,\r\n\r\nI have observed from Baron Montesquieu, that the British\r\nconstitution has liberty for its direct object and that the\r\nconstitution of this province, according to Mr. Hutchinson, is an\r\nepitome of the British constitution: That the right of\r\nrepresentation in the body that legislates, is essential to the\r\nBritish constitution, without which there cannot be liberty; and\r\nChronus himself acknowledges, that the Americans are \"incapable of\r\nexercising this right\": Let him draw what conclusion he pleases.\r\nAll I insist upon is, that the conclusion cannot be just, that\r\n\"the parliament's laying duties upon trade with the express\r\npurpose of raising a revenue, is not repugnant to or subversive of\r\nour constitution.\" This doctrine, tho' long exploded by the best\r\nwriters on both sides of the atlantic, he now urges; and he is\r\nreduced to this necessity, in order to justify or give coloring to\r\nhis frequent bold assertions, that \"no one has attempted even to\r\ninfringe our liberties,\" and to his ungenerous reflections upon\r\nthose who declare themselves of a different mind, as \"pretended\r\npatriots,\" \"overzealous,\" \"intemperate politicians,\" \"men of no\r\nproperty,\" who \"expect to find their account\" in perpetually\r\nkeeping up the ball of contention. But after all that Chronus and\r\nhis associates have said, or can say, the people of America have\r\njust \"grounds still to complain\" that their rights are violated.\r\nThere seems to be a system of \"tyranny and oppression\" already\r\nbegun. It is therefore the duty of every honest man, to alarm his\r\nfellow-citizens and countrymen, and awaken in them the utmost\r\nvigilance and circumspection. Jealousy, especially at such a time,\r\nis a political virtue: Nay, I will say, it is a moral virtue; for\r\nwe are under all obligations to do what in us lies to save our\r\ncountry.\" Tyrants alone, says the great Vatel, will treat as\r\nseditious, those brave and resolute citizens, who exhort the\r\npeople to preserve themselves from oppression, in vindication of\r\ntheir rights and privileges: A good prince, says he, will commend\r\nsuch virtuous patriots\" and will \"mistrust the selfish suggestions\r\nof a minister, who represents to him as rebels, all those citizens\r\nwho do not hold out their hands to chains, who refuse lamely to\r\nsuffer the strokes of arbitrary power.\"\r\n\r\nI cannot help observing how artfully Chronus expresses his\r\nposition, that the  \"parliament's laying duties upon trade with\r\nthe express purpose of raising a revenue, is not repugnant to our\r\nconstitution.\" It has not been made a question, that I know of,\r\nwhether the parliament hath a right to make laws for the\r\nregulation of the trade of the colonies. Power she undoubtedly has\r\nto enforce her acts of trade: And the strongest maritime power\r\ncaeteris paribus, will always make the most advantageous treaties,\r\nand give laws of trade to other nations, for whom there can be no\r\npretence to the right of legislation. The matter however should be\r\nconsidered equitably, if it should ever be considered at all: If\r\nthe trade of the Colonies is protected by the British navy, there\r\nmay possibly be from thence inferr'd a just right in the\r\nparliament of Great Britain to restrain them from carrying on\r\ntheir trade to the injury of the trade of Great Britain. But this\r\nbeing granted, it is very different from the right to make laws in\r\nall cases whatever binding upon the Colonies, and especially for\r\nlaying duties upon trade for the express purpose of raising a\r\nrevenue. In the one case it may be the wisdom of the Colonies,\r\nunder present circumstances to acquiesce in reasonable\r\nrestrictions, rather than lose their whole trade by means of the\r\ndepredations of a foreign power: In the other, it is a duty they\r\nowe themselves and their posterity, by no means to acquiesce;\r\nbecause it involves them in a state of perfect slavery. I say\r\nperfect slavery: For, as political liberty in its perfection\r\nconsists in the people's consenting by themselves or their\r\nrepresentatives, to all laws which they are bound to obey, so\r\nperfect political slavery consists in their being bound to obey\r\nany laws for taxing them, to which they cannot consent. If a\r\npeople can be deprived of their property by another person or\r\nnation, it is evident that such a people cannot be free. Whether\r\nit be by a nation or a monarch, is not material: The masters\r\nindeed are different, but the government is equally despotic; and\r\ntho' the despotism may be mild, from principles of policy, it is\r\nnot the less a despotism.\r\n\r\nChronus talks of Magna Charta as though it were of no greater\r\nconsequence than an act of parliament for the establishment of a\r\ncorporation of buttonmakers. Whatever low ideas he may entertain\r\nof that Great Charter, and such ideas he must entertain of it to\r\nsupport the cause he hath espous'd, it is affirm'd by Lord Coke,\r\nto be declaratory of the principal grounds of the fundamental laws\r\nand liberties of England. \"It is called Charta Libertatum Regni,\r\nthe Charter of the Liberties of the kingdom, upon great reason,\r\nsays that sage of the law, because liberos facit, it makes and\r\npreserves the people free.\" Those therefore who would make the\r\npeople slaves, would fain have them look upon this charter, in a\r\nlight of indifference, which so often affirms sua jura, suas\r\nlibertates, their own rights, their own liberties: But if it be\r\ndeclaratory of the principal grounds of the fundamental laws and\r\nliberties of England, it cannot be altered in any of its essential\r\nparts, without altering the constitution. Whatever Chronus may\r\nhave adopted from Mr. Hume, Vatel tells us plainly and without\r\nhesitation, that \"the supreme legislative cannot change the\r\nconstitution,\" \"that their authority does not extend so far,\" &\r\n\"that they ought to consider the fundamental laws as sacred, if\r\nthe nation has not, in very express terms, given them power to\r\nchange them.\" And he gives a reason for it solid and weighty; for,\r\nsays he, \"the constitution of the state ought to be fixed.\" Mr.\r\nHume, as quoted by Chronus, says, the only rule of government is\r\nthe established practice of the age, upon maxims universally\r\nassented to. If then any deviation is made from the maxims upon\r\nwhich the established practice of the age is founded, it must be\r\nby universal assent. \"The fundamental laws,\" says Vatel, \"are\r\nexcepted from their (legislators) commission,\" \"nothing leads us\r\nto think that the nation was willing to submit the constitution\r\nitself to their pleasure.\" \"They derive their authority from the\r\nconstitution, how then can they change it without destroying the\r\nfoundation of their own authority?\" If then according to Lord\r\nCoke, Magna Charta is declaratory of the principal grounds of the\r\nfundamental laws and liberties of the people, and Vatel is right\r\nin his opinion, that the supreme legislative cannot change the\r\nconstitution, I think it follows, whether Lord Coke has expressly\r\nasserted it or not, that an act of parliament made against Magna\r\nCharta in violation of its essential parts, is void. - \"By the\r\nfundamental laws of England, says Vatel, the two houses of\r\nparliament in concert with the King, exercise the legislative\r\npower: But if the two houses should resolve to suppress\r\nthemselves, and to invest the King with the full and absolute\r\ngovernment, certainly the nation would not suffer it, \"although it\r\nwas done by a solemn act of parliament. But such doctrine is\r\ndirectly the reverse of that which Chronus holds; which amounts to\r\nthis, that if the two houses should give up to the King, any, the\r\nmost essential rights of the people declared in Magna Charta, the\r\nnation has not a power either de jura or de facto to prevent it. I\r\nmay hereafter quote for his serious perusal, the reasoning of the\r\nimmortal Locke upon this important subject, and am, in the mean time,\r\n\r\nYour's,\r\nCANDIDUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF MASSACHUSETTS TO THE GOVERNOR,\r\nAPRIL 10, 1772.\r\n\r\n[Massachusetts State Papers, pp. 315, 316; a draft, is in the\r\nSamuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nMay it please your Excellency.\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives have duly considered your speech1 to\r\nboth Houses, at the opening of this session. Your Excellency is\r\npleased to acquaint us, that, \"if we had desired you to carry the\r\nCourt to Boston, because it is the most convenient place; and the\r\nprerogative of the Crown to instruct the Governor to convene the\r\nCourt at such place as his Majesty may think proper, had not been\r\ndenied; you should have obtained leave to meet us in Boston, at\r\nthis time; but that you shall not be at liberty to do so, whilst\r\nthis denial is persisted in.\"\r\n\r\nWe have maturely considered this point; and are still firmly in\r\nopinion, that such instruction is repugnant to the royal charter,\r\nwherein the Governor is vested with the full power of adjournment,\r\nproroguing and dissolving the General Assembly, as he shall judge\r\nnecessary. Nothing in the charter, appears to us to afford the\r\nleast grounds to conclude, that a right is reserved to his Majesty\r\nof controling the Governor, in thus exercising this full power.\r\nNor indeed does it seem reasonable that there should for, it being\r\nimpossible that any one, at the distance of three thousand miles,\r\nshould be able to foresee the most convenient time or place of holding\r\nthe Assembly, it is necessary that such discretionary power should be\r\nlodged with the Governor, who is, by Charter, constantly to reside\r\nwithin the Province.\r\n\r\nWe are still earnestly desirous of the removal of this Assembly to\r\nthe Court House, in Boston; and we are sorry that your\r\nExcellency's determination thereon, depends upon our disavowing\r\nthese principles; because we cannot do it consistently with the\r\nduty we owe our constituents. We are constrained to be explicit at\r\nthis time; for if we should be silent, after your Excellency has\r\nrecommended it to us, as a necessary preliminary, to desist from\r\nsaying any thing upon this head, while we request your Excellency\r\nfor a removal of the Assembly, for reasons of convenience only, it\r\nmight be construed as tacitly conceding to a doctrine injurious to\r\nthe constitution, and in effect, as rescinding our own record, of\r\nwhich we still deliberately approve.\r\n\r\nThe power of adjourning and proroguing the General Assembly, is a\r\npower in trust, to be exercised for the good of the province; this\r\nHouse have a right to judge for themselves, whether it was thus\r\nexercised. We cannot avoid taking this occasion, freely to declare\r\nto your Excellency, that the holding of the Assembly in this\r\nplace, without any good reason which we can conceive of, under the\r\nmany and great inconveniences which this, and former Houses, have\r\nso fully set forth to your Excellency, is, in our opinion, an\r\nundue exercise of power; and a very great grievance, which we\r\nstill hope will soon be fully redressed.\r\n\r\nYour Excellency may be assured, that this House will, with all\r\nconvenient despatch, take into our most serious consideration,\r\nthat part of your speech which concerns the establishment of a\r\npartition line between this province and the province of New York;\r\nand that we will, with great candor, contribute every thing in our\r\npower, to accomplish the same equitable terms.\r\n\r\nThe other parts of your Excellency's speech, have had the proper\r\nattention of the House; and we are determined, during the\r\nremainder of the session, which must be short, to consult his\r\nMajesty's real service - the true interest of the province.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 The original message of Governor Hutchinson of April 8, 1772, is\r\namong the Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library, and on it is\r\nendorsed, in the handwriting of Adams, the fourth paragraph of the\r\nfollowing reply.\r\n2 Massachusetts State Papers, pp. 313-315.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE SIGNED \"VINDEX.\"\r\n\r\n[Boston Gazette, April 20, 1772.]\r\n\r\nMessieurs EDES & GILL,\r\n\r\nPhilanthrop Jun. in Draper's paper of the 9th current tells us,\r\nthat \"For four or five years together nobody could appear in print\r\nunless he was a favourer of what is call'd Liberty,\" and therefore\r\nconcludes, \"Falshood has been imposed on the credulous readers of\r\nNews-papers, and has spread through the country for truth, because\r\nno one would contradict it.\" What fortitude must a man be\r\npossess'd of that can offer two such sentences to the eye of the\r\npublic in a paper which for that space has contained nothing else\r\nin the political way? Again, why have we a mark of distinction in\r\nthe signature? Was Philanthrop senior a liberty writer? Was the\r\nTrue Patriot a liberty writer? Were all the scribblers in Mein's\r\nChronicle friends or favourers of what is called liberty? Blush!\r\nreformer blush at imposition of so gross a kind!\r\n\r\nBut what are the falshoods these credulous people have been led to\r\nbelieve? Why it seems that men from Lancaster and elsewhere, have\r\nbeen insinuating that we laboured under grievances in commerce,\r\nlegislation, and execution of the wholesome laws of the land, when\r\nno such thing has been seen, felt, heard or understood among us;\r\nand one Lancaster man in particular, has been furnished with all\r\nhis prejudices from the letters of Junius Americanus, a despicable\r\ncreature (as we say) who has certainly blackened some men and\r\nmeasures in both Englands, in such manner as defies time itself to\r\nbleach their characters. And till the officious Philanthrop\r\nengaged, every one judged the friends, at least, of those\r\nrespectable men, would avoid the provocation of fresh caustics to\r\nsuch rankled ulcers; but luxuriant flesh forever interrupts the\r\nefficacy of the most healing plaisters, and must be removed as\r\nfast as it puts forth. Indeed gentlemen, I myself who live in\r\nBoston, the centre of American politicks, have suspected we had\r\nsome grievances to complain of before either Junius Anglicanus or\r\nAmericanus ever published a letter on the subject to my knowledge:\r\nI thought the stamp-act a grievance, I think the extension of the\r\nvice-admiralty courts a grievance, I think the captious and\r\nunprecedented treatment of our legislature a grievance; and above\r\nall, I think the alteration of our free and mutually dependent\r\nconstitution, into a dependent ministerial despotism a grievance\r\nso great, so ignominious and intolerable, that in case I did not\r\nhope things would in some measure regain their ancient situation,\r\nwithout more blood shed and murder than has already been\r\ncommitted, I could freely wish at the risk of my all to have a\r\nfair chance of offering to the manes of my slaughtered countrymen\r\na libation of the blood of the ruthless traitors who conspired\r\ntheir destruction. It is here I confess my fingers would fall with\r\nweight, let those of Dr. Y -g, Mr. -x, or even Mr. A -s, fall how\r\nor where they pleased.\r\n\r\nVINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF MASSACHUSETTS TO THE GOVERNOR.\r\nJULY 14, 1772.1\r\n\r\n[Massachusetts State Papers, pp. 330, 331 ; extracts are printed\r\nin W. V. Wells, Life of Samuel Adams, vol. i., p. 482, with the\r\nstatement that such extracts were copied from an original draft in the\r\nautograph of Adams.2]\r\n\r\nMay it please your Excellency,\r\n\r\nIn answer to your message of yesterday, this House beg leave to\r\nobserve, that they are not unapprized that the Province House is\r\nout of repair, and that expense might be saved, by making such\r\nrepairs as are necessary, as soon as may be. But, that building\r\nwas procured for the residence of a Governor, whose sole support\r\nwas to be provided for by the grants and acts of the General\r\nAssembly, according to the tenor of the charter: and, it is the\r\nopinion of this House, that it never was expected by any Assembly of\r\nthis province, that it would be appropriated for the residence of any\r\nGovernor, for whose support, adequate provision should be made in\r\nanother way. Upon this consideration, we cannot think it our duty to\r\nmake any repairs, at this time.\r\n\r\nYour Excellency may be assured, that this House is far from being\r\ninfluenced by any personal disrespect. Should the time come, which\r\nwe hope for, when your Excellency shall think yourself at liberty\r\nto accept of your whole support from this province, according to\r\nancient and invariable usage, we doubt not, but you will then find\r\nthe Representatives of this people ready to provide for your\r\nExcellency a house, not barely tenantable, but elegant. In the\r\nmean time, as your Excellency receives from his Majesty a certain\r\nand adequate support, we cannot have the least apprehensions that\r\nyou will be so far guided by your own inclination, as that you\r\nwill make any town in the province the place of your residence,\r\nbut where it shall be most conducive to his Majesty's service, and\r\nthe good and welfare of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 On this date the Governor prorogued the General Court to meet\r\nagain September 30.

No Prince can levy\r\nit unless through Tyranny and under Penalty of Excommunication. But\r\nthere are those who are Bruitish enough not to know what they can do\r\nor omit in this Affair.\r\n\r\nSuch is the language of a great and good Historian and Statesman,\r\na Subject of France. Had the English Politicians and Ministers\r\nbeen either half as honest or half as wise as he, they would never\r\nhave driven the American Revenue without the Grant or Consent of\r\nthose who pay it, to such a length, as to cause an Alienation of\r\naffection which perhaps may not easily if ever be recovered. By\r\nthis kind of politics, says the worthy Frenchman, Charles the\r\nseventh brought a heavy Sin upon his own Soul and upon that of his\r\nSuccessors, and gave his Kingdom a Wound which would continue long\r\nto bleed. The British Ministers, possibly, may entertain different\r\nIdeas of Morals from those of the French Historian, if indeed they\r\nhave any such kind of ideas at all. However, the Nation, I fear,\r\nwill have Occasion to rue the day, when they suffer'd their\r\nPolitics so far to prevail, as to gain such an Influence in their\r\nParliament as they certainly did in the last, to say nothing of\r\nthe present. The Impositions upon the French, says Mr. Gordon,2\r\ngrew monstrous almost as soon as they grew arbitrary. Charles the\r\nseventh, who began them, never rais'd annually more than one\r\nhundred and eighty thousand Pounds. His Son Lewis the eleventh\r\nalmost trebled the Revenue; and since then, all that the Kingdom and\r\nPeople had, even to their Skins, has hardly been thought\r\nsufficient for their Kings.\" An awakening Caution to Americans!\r\nLest by tamely submitting to be plundered, they encourage their\r\nPlunderers to grasp at all they have.\r\n\r\nThe Merchants of this Continent have passively submitted to the\r\nIndignity of a Tribute; and the Landholders, tho' Sharers in the\r\nIndignity, have been perhaps too unconcern'd Spectators of the\r\nhumiliating Scene. Posterity, who will no doubt revenge their\r\nFathers Wrongs, may also be ashamed, when in the Page of History\r\nthey are informed of their tame Subjection. Had the Body of this\r\nPeople shown a proper Resentment, at the time when the proud\r\nTaskmasters first made their appearance, we should never have seen\r\nPensioners multiplying like the Locusts in Egypt, which devoured\r\nevery green Thing. I speak with Assurance; because it seldom has\r\nhappened if ever, that even a small People has been kept long in\r\nBondage, when they have unitedly and perseveringly resolv'd to be\r\nFree.\r\n\r\nAt that critical Period, we hearkened to what we then took to be,\r\nthe Dictates of sound policy and Prudence. We were led to place a\r\nConfidence in those, whose Protection we had a right to claim, and\r\nwe hoped for Deliverance in dry Remonstrances and humble\r\nSupplication. We have petition'd, repeatedly petition'd, and our\r\nPetitions have been heard, barely heard! The Grievances of this\r\nContinent have no doubt \"reached the Royal Ear\"; I wish I could\r\nsee reason to say they had touch'd the Royal Heart. No - They yet\r\nremain altogether unredress'd. Such has been the baneful Influence\r\nof corrupt and infamous Ministers and Servants of the Crown; that\r\nthe Complaints of three Millions of loyal Subjects have not yet\r\npenetrated the Royal Breast, to move it even to pity.\r\n\r\nHave not our humble Petitions, breathing a true Spirit of rational\r\nLoyalty, and expressive of a just Sense of those Liberties the\r\nRestoration of which we implored, been followed with Grievance\r\nupon Grievance, as fast as the cruel Heart and Hand of a most\r\nexecrable Paricide could invent and fabricate them? I will not at\r\npresent enumerate Grievances; they are known, sufficiently known,\r\nfelt and understood. Is it not enough, to have a Governor, an\r\navowed Advocate for ministerial Measures, and a most assiduous\r\nInstrument in carrying them on - moddel'd, shaped, controul'd, and\r\ndirected-totally independant of the people over whom he is\r\ncommissioned to govern, and yet absolutely dependent upon the\r\nCrown - pensioned by those on whom his existence depends, and paid\r\nout of a Revenue establish'd by those who have no Authority to\r\nestablish it, and extorted from the People in a Manner most\r\nOdious, insulting and oppressive. Is not this, Indignity enough to\r\nbe felt by those who have any feeling? Are we still threatned with\r\nmore? Is Life, Property and every Thing dear and sacred, to be now\r\nsubmitted to the Decisions of PENSION'D JUDGES, holding their\r\nplaces during the pleasure of such a Governor, and a Council\r\nperhaps overawed! To what a State of Infamy, Wretchedness and\r\nMisery shall we be reduc'd if our Judges shall be prevail'd upon\r\nto be thus degraded to Hirelings, and the Body of the People shall\r\nsuffer their free Constitution to be overturn'd and ruin'd.\r\nMerciful GOD! Inspire Thy People with Wisdom and Fortitude, and\r\ndirect them to gracious Ends. In this extreme Distress, when the\r\nPlan of Slavery seems nearly compleated, 0 save our Country from\r\nimpending Ruin - Let not the iron Hand of Tyranny ravish our Laws\r\nand seize the Badge of Freedom, nor avow'd Corruption and the\r\nmurderous Rage of lawless Power be ever seen on the sacred Seat of\r\nJustice!\r\n\r\nIs it not High Time for the People of this Country explicitly to\r\ndeclare, whether they will be Freemen or Slaves? It is an\r\nimportant Question which ought to be decided. It concerns us more\r\nthan any Thing in this Life. The Salvation of our Souls is\r\ninterested in the Event: For wherever Tyranny is establish'd,\r\nImmorality of every Kind comes in like a Torrent. It is in the\r\nInterest of Tyrants to reduce the People to Ignorance and Vice.\r\nFor they cannot live in any Country where Virtue and Knowledge\r\nprevail. The Religion and public Liberty of a People are\r\nintimately connected; their Interests are interwoven, they cannot\r\nsubsist separately; and therefore they rise and fall together. For\r\nthis Reason, it is always observable, that those who are combin'd\r\nto destroy the People's Liberties, practice every Art to poison\r\ntheir Morals. How greatly then does it concern us, at all Events,\r\nto put a Stop to the Progress of Tyranny. It is advanced already\r\nby far too many Strides. We are at this moment upon a precipice.\r\nThe next step may be fatal to us. Let us then act like wise Men;\r\ncalmly took around us and consider what is best to be done. Let us\r\nconverse together upon this most interesting Subject and open our\r\nminds freely to each other. Let it be the topic of conversation in\r\nevery social Club. Let every Town assemble. Let Associations &\r\nCombinations be everywhere set up to consult and recover our just\r\nRights.\r\n\r\n\" The Country claims our active Aid.\r\nThat let us roam; & where we find a Spark\r\nOf public Virtue, blow it into Flame.\"\r\n\r\nVALERIUS POPLIC0LA.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Attributed to Adams by W.

I therefore upon the first Notice, make use of\r\nthis Conveyance to assure you of my tender Regards & Affection for\r\nyou as a Brother; sincerely hoping this will meet yourself &\r\nFamily in health & happiness. Indeed common Experience convinces\r\nme that there is very little Dependence upon either in this Life;\r\nWe too often mistake our true Happiness, and when we arrive to the\r\nEnjoyment of that which seemd to promise it to us, we find that it is\r\nall an imaginary Dream, at the best fleeting & transitory. We have an\r\naffecting Instance of this within our own Connections; Your amiable\r\nSister Kitty was agreably married, and when in the daily Expectation\r\nof seeing the happy Pledge of conjugal Affection, cutt off without a\r\nmoments Warning of the fatal Stroke of Death! Still more happy\r\nhowever in another Life as we [have] abundant Reason to be\r\nassured; for the Christian Temper & Behavior she constantly\r\nexhibited, when she least expected it, afford us more solid hopes\r\nof her present Happiness, than any Expressions she might have made\r\nuse of, had she been permitted, at the time of her Departure. One\r\nwould from this & other like Instances conclude, that to be\r\npossessd of the Christian Principles, & to accommodate our whole\r\nDeportment to such Principles, is to be happy in this Life; it is\r\nthis that sweetens every thing we enjoy; indeed of it self it\r\nyields us full Satisfaction, & thus puts it out of the power of\r\nthe World to disappoint us by any of its frowns.\r\n\r\nYour last Letter mentioned your Expectation of the sudden\r\nDissolution of your General Assembly, which I perceive afterwards\r\ntook place. It appears still to be the determination of the\r\nministry to enslave the Colonies, and the Governors are to be the\r\nInstruments. It therefore behoves every Colony to be vigilant; &\r\nagreably to the Advice of the Pennsylvania Farmer, Each should\r\nsupport the others. This Province seems to be devoted to\r\nministerial Vengeance. We have been long struggling against the\r\nIncroachments of Tyranny, which now threatens its Completion by\r\nthe Independency of the Governor & the Judges of the superior\r\nCourt. If the Tribute which is by Acts of Parliament extorted from\r\nthe Americans, is appropriated for making the executive Power\r\ntotally independent of the People for their Support, while it is\r\nabsolutely dependent upon the Crown for its being as well as\r\nSubsistence, there will be an End of freedom. In such Courts &\r\nunder such an Administration, you will easily conceive what\r\nConstructions of Law & what Decisions the people are to expect. I\r\nsend you two or three of our latest papers; there may be some\r\nSpeculations upon the Subject in them, which you may think proper\r\nto get republishd in your papers.\r\n\r\nYou mentiond in one of your Letters your Intention to send your\r\nDaughter here, than which nothing would be more agreable to us.\r\n\r\nYour Sister, my dear Betsy,2 joyns with me in Expressions of Love\r\nto Mrs Wells, & begs me to assure you that she is, as I am in\r\nstrict truth\r\nYours affectionately,\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Brother-in-law of Adams.\r\n2 Mrs. Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ELBRIDGE GERRY.\r\n\r\n[J. T. Austin, Life of Elbridge Gerry, vol. i., Pp. 9, 10.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, October 27, 1772.\r\n\r\nI have just now received your favour, dated this day. I am\r\nperfectly of your opinion with regard to the independency of the\r\njudges.  It is a matter beyond doubt in my mind. I was told yesterday,\r\nby one of his majesty's council, that Mr. Hutchinson has a letter by\r\nthe packet, from Bernard, which advises him of it as a fact. This town\r\nis to meet to-morrow, to consider what is proper for them to do. We\r\nhave looked upon it as of so interesting a nature to us, that even the\r\nreport should alarm us. It is proposed by many among us to apply\r\nto the judges for their explicit declaration, whether they will\r\naccept of so odious a support, and to apply also to the governour\r\nfor a general assembly forthwith. I will write you on Thursday,\r\nand let you know the event. Our enemies would intimidate us, by\r\nsaying our brethren in the other towns are indifferent about this\r\nmatter, for which reason I am particularly glad to receive your\r\nletter at this time. Roxbury, I am told, is thoroughly awake. I wish\r\nwe could arouse the continent.\r\n\r\nI write in the utmost haste,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ELBRIDGE GERRY.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library; a text with slight\r\nvariations is in J. T. Austin, Life of Elbridge Gerry, vol. i., pp.\r\n10-12.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON Oct 29 1772\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nI wrote you in great Haste on Tuesday last. Since which the\r\nFreeholders & other Inhabitts of this Town have had a Meeting,1 to\r\nenquire into the Grounds of the Report that the Salaries of the\r\nJudges are fixd & paid by order of the Crown, and to determine upon\r\nsuch measures as should be proper for them to take upon so alarming\r\nan Occasion.\r\n\r\nThe inclosd paper contains a short but true Account of their\r\nproceedings. It is proposd by some to petition the Governr to\r\norder a session of the Genl Assembly, and that the Town should\r\nexpressly declare their natural & Charter Rights to their\r\nRepresentatives, and the Instances in which they have been\r\nviolated peremptorily requiring them to take every Step which the\r\nConstitution prescribes to redress our Grievances, or if every\r\nsuch Step has been already taken, to inform their Constituents,\r\nthat they may devise such Measures as they may see their way clear\r\nto take, or patiently bear the Yoke. I will acquaint you with the\r\nproceedings of the Town as they pass. In the mean time I wish your\r\nTown would think it proper to have a Meeting, which may be most\r\nseasonable at this time. For as the Superr Court is to be held at\r\nSalem next Week, you will have the Oppy of making a decent\r\nApplication to them, & enquiring of the Certainty of this Report,\r\n& other matters mentd in your Letter to me. Which Enquiry will be\r\nmore naturally made to them in Case the Govr should decline\r\nanswering the message of this Town, or do it, if I may be allowd\r\nthe Expression, equivocally.\r\n\r\nThis Country must shake off their intollerable burdens at all\r\nEvents. Every day strengthens our oppressors & weakens us. If each\r\nTown would declare its Sense of these Matters I am perswaded our\r\nEnemies would not have it in their power to divide us, in whh they\r\nhave all along shown their dexterity. Pray use your Influence with\r\nSalem & other Towns - But I am now going with our Comt to his\r\nExcellency.2 Shall be glad of a Letter from you. Your last I read\r\nto the Town to their great Satisfaction though I concealed the\r\nname of its worthy Author.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 October 28, Boston Record Commissioners' Report, vol. xviii., p.\r\n88.\r\n2 Adams, Otis and Joseph Warren were members of a committee of\r\nseven appointed by the Town of Boston on October 28 to present to\r\nthe Governor the address adopted by the Town on that date.

Lee, Life of Arthur Lee, vol. ii., Pp. 193-195.]\r\nBOSTON Novr 3 1772\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR/\r\n\r\nSince my last we have Advice that Lord Hillsborough is removd from\r\nthe American Department, & tho he makes his Exit with the smiles &\r\nhonors of the Court, he has the Curses of the disinterrested &\r\nbetter part of the Colonists. Not that it is thought his Lordship\r\nis by any means to be reckoned the most inveterate & active of all\r\nthe Conspirators against our Rights: There are others on this Side\r\nof the Atlantick who have been more assiduous in plotting the Ruin\r\nof our Liberties than even he, and they are the more infamous,\r\nbecause the Country they would enslave, is that very Country in which\r\n(to use the Words of their Adulators & Expectants) they were \"born &\r\neducated.\"\r\n\r\nThe Character of Lord Dartmouth has been unexceptionable in\r\nAmerica in point of moral Virtue; I wish it could be ascertaind of\r\nall his Majestys Ministers and Servants. It is the opinion I have\r\nof them that makes me tremble for his Lordship, lest in the Circle\r\nhe should make Shipwreck of his Virtue. I am well informd that he\r\nhas wrote a very polite Letter to Hutchinson, in which he\r\nexpresses a Satisfaction in his Conduct, & tells him he has always\r\nbeen of Opinion that the King has a Right to pay his Governors &\r\nother officers but surely he should have made himself thoroughly\r\nacquainted with the several political Institutions and Charters of\r\nthe Colonies as well as the nature of free Governments in general\r\nbefore he explicitly & officially declares such an Opinion. I wish\r\na Consideration that he has to correspond with the most artful\r\nplausible and insinuating Geniusses, & some of them the most\r\nmalicious Enemies of the common Rights of Mankind, might induce\r\nhis Lordship to be upon his Guard against too suddenly giving full\r\nCredit to their Representations, which perhaps was the capital\r\nmistake of his predecessor in office - our Conspirators were\r\nalarmd at his Appointment & I believe are determined if they can\r\nto impose upon his Credulity, if he has any such Weakness about\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWe are now alarmd with the Advice that the Judges of our Superior\r\nCourt, have Salaries appointed by order of the Crown, independent\r\nof the people. This has occasiond a meeting of this metropolis,\r\nthe proceedings of which you have in the inclosed papers. At the\r\nfirst meeting on the Wednesday2 & at the last Adjournment on the\r\nMonday3 following, there was a respectable Appearance of the\r\nInhabitants, tho not so full as has sometimes been on Occasions of\r\nmuch less Importance; owing partly to its being the Season of the\r\nyear when the Town is filled with our Country folks & every one is\r\nlaying up provisions necessary for the approaching long Winter,\r\npartly from the Industry of the Enemies to prevent a full meeting\r\nas they before had been to prevent any meeting at all (for they\r\ndread nothing more) & partly from the Opinion of some that there\r\nwas no method left to be taken but the last, which is also the\r\nOpinion of many in the Country. However as I said before, there\r\nwas a respectable meeting; and I think the Town has taken a\r\nnecessary Step to ascertain the true Sense of the Country with\r\nregard to our Grievances, which being known, it will be the easier\r\nto determine upon & prosecute to Effect the Methods which ought to\r\nbe taken for the Redress of our intollerable Grievances. The\r\nTories give out, tho in Whispers, that they expect what they call\r\na Breese before long, which they say they gather from the slow,\r\nbut regular Approaches that are made. They will form what Judgment\r\nthey please. Perhaps they begin to be apprehensive that the body\r\nof a long insulted people will bear the Insults & Oppression no\r\nlonger than untill they feel in themselves Strength to shake off the\r\nYoke. If this is their Determination, it is justifiable as far as the\r\nDeclaration of Mr. H. himself has Weight; for I am told by a Gentleman\r\nwhom I can credit, that in Conversation he said there was nothing in\r\nMorality that forbid Resistance.\r\n\r\nIn your last you expressd your hopes of the removal of\r\nHillsborough. I could not joyn with you; for if I am to have a\r\nmaster, let me have a severe one that I may always have the\r\nmortifying Sense of it. I shall then always be disposed to take\r\nthe first fair Opportunity of ridding my self of Slavery. There is\r\ndanger of the peoples being flatterd with such partial Reliefe as\r\nLord Dartmouth may be able, (if disposed) to obtain for them &\r\nbuilding upon vain Hopes till their Chains are rivetted. Are they\r\nnot still heaping Grievance upon Grievance, & while they remain,\r\nto what purpose would it be if his Lordship should get a few\r\nboyish Instructions to the Govr relaxed? Would this be a reason\r\nfor a final Submission to a Tribute & Egyptian Taskmasters in\r\nSupport of despotick Power! The Tribute, the Tribute is the\r\nIndignity which I hope in God will never be patiently borne by a\r\nPeople who of all the people on the Earth deserve most to be free.\r\n\r\nI am astonishd that [Dr. Franklin] has written no Letter to the\r\nSpeaker.\r\n\r\nI shall write you by the next Ship.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Arthur Lee to Samuel Adams, January 25, 1773: \"I have just now\r\nreceived your favour of Nov. 3, 1772, together with a pamphlet and\r\nsome papers, for which I am extremely obliged to you. . . . I\r\nshall take the liberty of putting the first part of your letter in\r\nthe newspapers here, as I think it extremely proper my Lord\r\nDartmouth should read the excellent admonition it contains.\" R.

T. Austin, Life of Elbridge Gerry, vol. i., pp. 15-l8.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON 5 Novr 1772\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\nI recd with pleasure your Letter of the 2d Inst. I was sure you cd\r\nnot but be of Opinion, that Unanimity in the Measures taken by the\r\nfriends of the Country is of the utmost Importance. I must with\r\ngreat Deferrence to your Judgment, think that even in our wretched\r\nState, the mode of petitioning the Govr will have a good Effect. I\r\nwas aware that his Answers would be in the same high tone, in\r\nwhich we find them expressd; yet our requests have been so\r\nreasonable that in refusing to comply with them he must have put\r\nhimself in the wrong -, in the opinion of every honest & sensible\r\nman; the Consequence of which will be, that such measures as the\r\npeople may determine upon to save themselves, if rational & manly,\r\nwill be the more reconcileable even to cautious minds, & thus we\r\nmay expect that Unanimity which we wish for.\r\n\r\nI have the satisfaction of inclosing the last proceedings of our\r\nTown meeting, in which I think you will perceive a Coincidence\r\nwith your own Judgment, in a plan concerted for the whole to act\r\nupon. Our timid sort of people are disconcerted, when they are\r\npositively told that the Sentiments of the Country are different\r\nfrom those of the City. Therefore a free Communication with each\r\nTown will serve to ascertain this matter; and when once it appears\r\nbeyond Contradiction, that we are united in Sentiments there will\r\nbe a Confidence in each other, & a plan of Opposition will be\r\neasily formed, & executed with Spirit. In such a Case (to return\r\nyour own Language with entire Approbation) those \"who have Virtue\r\nenough to oppose the wicked designs of the Great, will have this\r\nfor their boast that they have struggled for & with an honest\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\nI was at first of your Opinion \"that it wd be most proper for a\r\nCome from Boston, united with Comtes from two or three other Towns\r\nto wait on the Judges\" &c. and I mentiond it to several Gentlemen\r\nof the Neighboring Towns who approved of it, but so much Caution\r\nprevails, that they suspected whether their respective towns wd\r\nstir till Boston had given the Lead, (a needless Compliment to the\r\nCapital); This turnd our Thoughts to the Measures taken by the\r\nTown, & led me to conceive hopes, that as the Superr Court wd be\r\nsoon sitting at Salem, Mbl Head & other towns in that County would\r\ncome into such a proposal.\r\n\r\nI take Notice of what you observe \"that our whole dependence as\r\npeople seems to be upon our own Wisdom & Valor,\" in which I fully\r\nagree with you. It puts me in mind of a Letter I recd not along\r\nago from a friend of mine of some note in London, wherein he says,\r\n\"your whole dependence under God is upon your own Virtue, (Valor).\r\nI know of no Noblemen in this Kingdom who care any thing about\r\nyou, excepting Lords Chatham & Shelburne, & you would do well to\r\nbe watchful even of them.\"\r\n\r\nI earnestly wish that the Inhabitants of Marblehead & other Towns\r\nwould severally meet, & if they see Cause, among other Measures,\r\nsecond this town & appoint a Come to be ready to communicate with\r\nours1 when ready. This would at once discover an Union of Sentiments\r\nthus far & have its Influence on other Towns. It wd at least show that\r\nBoston is not wholly deserted, & might prevent \"its falling a\r\nSacrifice to the Rage or ridicule of our (common) Enemies.\"\r\nI shall be pleasd with your further Sentiments & am in strict truth,\r\n\r\n\r\n1 The Boston Committee of Correspondence was appointed on November\r\n2. \"It was then moved by Mr Samuel Adams, That a Committee of\r\nCorrespondence be appointed to consist of twenty one Persons - to\r\nstate the Rights of the Colonists and of this Province in\r\nparticular, as Men, as Christians, and as Subjects; to communicate\r\nand publish the same to the several Towns in this Province and to\r\nthe World as the sense of this Town, with the Infringements and\r\nViolations thereof that have been, or from time to time may be\r\nmade - Also requesting of each Town a free communication of their\r\nSentiments on this Subject - And the Question being accordingly\r\nput - Passed in the Affermative.

It is a great Satisfaction to me to be assured from you\r\nthat the Friends to Liberty in Marblehead are active & that there\r\nis like to be a Town meeting there. Our Committee are industrious,\r\nand I think I may promise you, they will be ready to report to the\r\nTown in two or three days; so that if your Town should think\r\nproper to make an Adjournment for ten days or a Fortnight, they\r\nwill doubtless by that time if not before have an Opportunity of\r\nacting upon our Resolutions. I am sorry when any of our Proceedings\r\nare not exactly according to your Mind. The Word you object to2 in our\r\nresolves was designd to introduce into our State of Grievances\r\n\"the Chh Innovations and the Establishment of those Tyrants in\r\nReligion, Bishops\" which as you observe will probably take place.\r\nI cannot but hope, when you consider how indifferent too many of\r\nthe Clergy are to our just & righteous Cause, that some of them\r\nare the Adulators of our Oppressors, and even some of the best of\r\nthem are extremely cautious of recommending (at least in their\r\npublick performances), the Rights of their Country to the\r\nprotection of Heaven, lest they should give offence to the little\r\nGods on Earth, you will judge it quite necessary that we should\r\nassert [and] vindicate our Rights as Christians as well as Men &\r\nSubjects.\r\n\r\nThe Town of Roxbury are to meet on Monday next; and a great Number\r\nin Cambridge have subscribed a Petition to their Selectmen for a\r\nMeeting there. I have recd a Letter from a Gentleman of Influence\r\nin Plymouth who is pleasd to say, he thinks the general plan\r\nadopted here will produce great Consequences if supported with\r\nSpirit in the Country; & that he believes there will be no\r\nDifficulty in getting a Meeting there & carrying the point in\r\nseconding this town. He tells me, the Pulse of his fellow Townsmen\r\nbeat high and their resentment he supposes is equal to that of any\r\nother Town.  May God grant, that the Love of Liberty & a Zeal to\r\nsupport it may enkindle in every town. If the Enemies should see\r\nthe flame bursting in different parts of the Country & distant\r\nfrom each other, it might discourage their attempts to damp &\r\nquench it. I am well assured they are alarmd at the Measure now\r\ntaking, being greatly apprehensive of the same Consequences from\r\nit which our good friend at Plymouth hopes and expects. This\r\nshould animate us in carrying it into Execution. I beg you would\r\nexert your utmost Influence in your neighboring towns and\r\nelsewhere. I hear Nothing of old Salem.

Also requesting of each\r\nTown a free Communication of their Sentiments Reported First, a State\r\nof the Rights of the Colonists and of this Province in particular --\r\nSecondly, A List of the Infringements, and Violations of those Rights.\r\n-- Thirdly, A Letter of Correspondence with the other Towns. -- 1st.\r\nNatural Rights of the Colonists as Men. -- Among the Natural Rights of\r\nthe Colonists are these First. a Right to Life; Secondly to Liberty;\r\nthirdly to Property; together with the Right to support and defend\r\nthem in the best manner they can - Those are evident Branches of,\r\nrather than deductions from the Duty of Self Preservation, commonly\r\ncalled the first Law of Nature -\r\n\r\nAll Men have a Right to remain in a State of Nature as long as\r\nthey please: And in case of intollerable Oppression, Civil or\r\nReligious, to leave the Society they belong to, and enter into\r\nanother. -- When Men enter into Society, it is by voluntary\r\nconsent; and they have a right to demand and insist upon the\r\nperformance of such conditions, And previous limitations as form\r\nan equitable original compact. ---\r\n\r\nEvery natural Right not expressly given up or from the nature of a\r\nSocial Compact necessarily ceded remains.\r\n\r\nAll positive and civil laws, should conform as far as possible, to\r\nthe Law of natural reason and equity. -\r\n\r\nAs neither reason requires, nor religeon permits the contrary,\r\nevery Man living in or out of a state of civil society, has a\r\nright peaceably and quietly to worship God according to the\r\ndictates of his conscience. -\r\n\r\n\"Just and true liberty, equal and impartial liberty\" in matters\r\nspiritual and temporal, is a thing that all Men are clearly\r\nentitled to, by the eternal and immutable laws Of God and nature,\r\nas well as by the law of Nations, & all well grounded municipal\r\nlaws, which must have their foundation in the former. -\r\n\r\nIn regard to Religeon, mutual tolleration in the different professions\r\nthereof, is what all good and candid minds in all ages have ever\r\npracticed; and both by precept and example inculcated on mankind:\r\nAnd it is now generally agreed among christians that this spirit\r\nof toleration in the fullest extent consistent with the being of\r\ncivil society \"is the chief characteristical mark of the true\r\nchurch \" 3 & In so much that Mr Lock has asserted, and proved\r\nbeyond the possibility of contradiction on any solid ground, that\r\nsuch toleration ought to be extended to all whose doctrines are\r\nnot subversive of society. The only Sects which he thinks ought to\r\nbe, and which by all wise laws are excluded from such toleration, are\r\nthose who teach Doctrines subversive of the Civil Government under\r\nwhich they live. The Roman Catholicks or Papists are excluded by\r\nreason of such Doctrines as these \"that Princes excommunicated may be\r\ndeposed, and those they call hereticks may be destroyed without\r\nmercy; besides their recognizing the Pope in so absolute a manner,\r\nin subversion of Government, by introducing as far as possible\r\ninto the states, under whose protection they enjoy life, liberty\r\nand property, that solecism in politicks, Imperium in imperio 4\r\nleading directly to the worst anarchy and confusion, civil\r\ndiscord, war and blood shed -\r\n\r\nThe natural liberty of Men by entring into society is abridg'd or\r\nrestrained so far only as is necessary for the Great end of\r\nSociety the best good of the whole-\r\n\r\nIn the state of nature, every man is under God, Judge and sole\r\nJudge, of his own rights and the injuries done him: By entering\r\ninto society, he agrees to an Arbiter or indifferent Judge between\r\nhim and his neighbours; but he no more renounces his original\r\nright, than by taking a cause out of the ordinary course of law,\r\nand leaving the decision to Referees or indifferent Arbitrations.\r\nIn the last case he must pay the Referees for time and trouble; he\r\nshould be also willing to pay his Just quota for the support of\r\ngovernment, the law and constitution; the end of which is to\r\nfurnish indifferent and impartial Judges in all cases that may\r\nhappen, whether civil ecclesiastical, marine or military. -\r\n\r\n\"The natural liberty of man is to be free from any superior power\r\non earth, and not to be under the will or legislative authority of\r\nman ; but only to have the law of nature for his rule.\"-\r\n\r\nIn the state of nature men may as the Patriarchs did, employ hired\r\nservants for the defence of their lives, liberty and property: and\r\nthey should pay them reasonable wages. Government was instituted\r\nfor the purposes of common defence; and those who hold the reins\r\nof government have an equitable natural right to an honourable\r\nsupport from the same principle \"that the labourer is worthy of\r\nhis hire\" but then the same community which they serve, ought to\r\nbe assessors of their pay: Governors have no right to seek what\r\nthey please; by this, instead of being content with the station\r\nassigned them, that of honourable servants of the society, they\r\nwould soon become Absolute masters, Despots, and Tyrants. Hence as\r\na private man has a right to say, what wages he will give in his\r\nprivate affairs, so has a Community to determine what they will\r\ngive and grant of their Substance, for the Administration of\r\npublick affairs. And in both cases more are ready generally to\r\noffer their Service at the proposed and stipulated price, than are\r\nable and willing to perform their duty. -\r\n\r\nIn short it is the greatest absurdity to suppose it in the power\r\nof one or any number of men at the entering into society, to\r\nrenounce their essential natural rights, or the means of\r\npreserving those rights when the great end of civil government\r\nfrom the very nature of its institution is for the support,\r\nprotection and defence of those very rights: the principal of\r\nwhich as is before observed, are life liberty and property. If men\r\nthrough fear, fraud or mistake, should in terms renounce and give\r\nup any essential natural right, the eternal law of reason and the\r\ngreat end of society, would absolutely vacate such renunciation;\r\nthe right to freedom being the gift of God Almighty, it is not in\r\nthe power of Man to alienate this gift, and voluntarily become a\r\nslave --\r\n\r\n2d The Rights of the Colonists as Christians - These may be best\r\nunderstood by reading - and carefully studying the institutes of\r\nthe great Lawgiver and head of the Christian Church: which are to\r\nbe found closely5 written and promulgated in the New Testament -\r\n\r\nBy the Act of the British Parliament commonly called the\r\nToleration Act, every subject in England Except Papists &c was\r\nrestored to, and re-established in, his natural right to worship\r\nGod according to the dictates of his own conscience. And by the\r\nCharter of this Province it is granted ordained and established\r\n(that it is declared as an original right) that there shall be\r\nliberty of conscience allowed in the worship of God, to all\r\nchristians except Papists, inhabiting or which shall inhabit or be\r\nresident within said Province or Territory.6 Magna Charta itself\r\nis in substance but a constrained Declaration, or proclamation,\r\nand promulgation in the name of King, Lord, and Commons of the\r\nsense the latter had of their original inherent, indefeazible\r\nnatural Rights,7 as also those of free Citizens equally perdurable\r\nwith the other. That great author that great jurist, and even that\r\nCourt writer W Justice Blackstone holds that this recognition was\r\njustly obtained of King John sword in hand: and peradventure it must\r\nbe one day sword in hand again rescued and preserved from total\r\ndestruction and oblivion.\r\n\r\n3d. The Rights of the Colonists as Subjects\r\n\r\nA Common Wealth or state is a body politick or civil society of\r\nmen, united together to promote their mutual safety and prosperity,\r\nby means of their union.8\r\n\r\nThe absolute Rights of Englishmen, and all freemen in or out of\r\nCivil society, are principally, personal security personal liberty\r\nand private property.\r\n\r\nAll Persons born in the British American Colonies are by the laws\r\nof God and nature, and by the Common law of England, exclusive of\r\nall charters from the Crown, well Entitled, and by the Acts of the\r\nBritish Parliament are declared to be entitled to all the natural\r\nessential, inherent & inseperable Rights Liberties and Privileges\r\nof Subjects born in Great Britain, or within the Realm. Among\r\nthose Rights are the following; which no men or body of men,\r\nconsistently with their own rights as men and citizens or members\r\nof society, can for themselves give up, or take away from others\r\n\r\nFirst, \"The first fundamental positive law of all Commonwealths or\r\nStates, is the establishing the legislative power; as the first\r\nfundamental natural law also, which is to govern even the legislative\r\npower itself, is the preservation of the Society.\"9\r\n\r\nSecondly, The Legislative has no right to absolute arbitrary power\r\nover the lives and fortunes of the people: Nor can mortals assume\r\na prerogative, not only too high for men, but for Angels; and\r\ntherefore reserved for the exercise of the Deity alone. -\r\n\r\n\"The Legislative cannot Justly assume to itself a power to rule by\r\nextempore arbitrary decrees; but it is bound to see that Justice\r\nis dispensed, and that the rights of the subjects be decided, by\r\npromulgated, standing and known laws, and authorized independent\r\nJudges;\" that is independent as far as possible of Prince or\r\nPeople. \"There shall be one rule of Justice for rich and poor; for\r\nthe favorite in Court, and the Countryman at the Plough.\"10\r\n\r\nThirdly, The supreme power cannot Justly take from any man, any\r\npart of his property without his consent, in person or by his\r\nRepresentative. -\r\n\r\nThese are some of the first principles of natural law & Justice,\r\nand the great Barriers of all free states, and of the British\r\nConstitution in particular. It is utterly irreconcileable to these\r\nprinciples, and to many other fundamental maxims of the common\r\nlaw, common sense and reason, that a British house of commons,\r\nshould have a right, at pleasure, to give and grant the property\r\nof the Colonists. That these Colonists are well entitled to all\r\nthe essential rights, liberties and privileges of men and freemen,\r\nborn in Britain, is manifest, not only from the Colony charter, in\r\ngeneral, but acts of the British Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe statute of the 13th of George 2. c. 7. naturalizes even\r\nforeigners after seven years residence. The words of the\r\nMassachusetts Charter are these, \"And further our will and\r\npleasure is, and we do hereby for us, our heirs and successors,\r\ngrant establish and ordain, that all and every of the subjects of\r\nus, our heirs and successors, which shall go to and inhabit within\r\nour said province or territory and every of their children which\r\nshall happen to be born there, or on the seas in going thither, or\r\nreturning from thence shall have and enjoy, all liberties and\r\nimmunities of free and natural subjects within any of the\r\ndominions of us, our heirs and successors, to all intents\r\nconstructions & purposes whatsoever as if they and every of them\r\nwere born within this our Realm of England.\" Now what liberty can\r\nthere be, where property is taken away without consent? Can it be\r\nsaid with any colour of truth and Justice, that this Continent of\r\nthree thousand miles in length, and of a breadth as yet\r\nunexplored, in which however, its supposed, there are five\r\nmillions of people, has the least voice, vote or influence in the\r\ndecisions of the British Parliament? Have they, all together, any\r\nmore right or power to return a single number11 to that house of\r\ncommons, who have not inadvertently, but deliberately assumed a'\r\npower to dispose of their lives,12 Liberties and properties, then13\r\nto choose an Emperor of China! Had the Colonists a right to\r\nreturn members to the british parliament, it would only be\r\nhurtfull; as from their local situation and circumstances it is\r\nimpossible they should be ever truly and properly represented\r\nthere. The inhabitants of this country in all probability in a few\r\nyears will be more numerous, than those of Great Britain and\r\nIreland together; yet it is absurdly expected by the promoters of\r\nthe present measures, that these, with their posterity to all\r\ngenerations, should be easy while their property, shall be\r\ndisposed of by a house of commons at three thousand miles distant\r\nfrom them; and who cannot be supposed to have the least care or\r\nconcern for their real interest: Who have not only no natural care\r\nfor their interest, but must be in effect bribed against it; as\r\nevery burden they lay on the colonists is so much saved or gained\r\nto themselves. Hitherto many of the Colonists have been free from\r\nQuit Rents; but if the breath of a british house of commons can\r\noriginate an act for taking away all our money, our lands will go\r\nnext or be subject to rack rents from haughty and relentless\r\nlandlords who will ride at ease, while we are trodden in the dirt.\r\nThe Colonists have been branded with the odious names of traitors\r\nand rebels, only for complaining of their grievances; How long\r\nsuch treatment will, or ought to be born is submitted.\r\n\r\nA List of Infringements & Violations of Rights\r\n\r\nWe cannot help thinking, that an enumeration of some of the most\r\nopen infringments of our rights, will by every candid Person be\r\nJudged sufficient to Justify whatever measures have been already\r\ntaken, or may be thought proper to be taken, in order to obtain a\r\nredress of the Grievances under which we labour.\r\n\r\nAmong many others we Humbly conceive, that the following will not\r\nfail to excite the attention of all who consider themselves\r\ninterested in the happiness and freedom of mankind in general, and\r\nof this continent and province in particular.\r\n\r\n1st - The British Parliament have assumed the power of legislation\r\nfor the Colonists in all cases whatsoever, without obtaining the\r\nconsent of the Inhabitants, which is ever essentially necessary to\r\nthe right establishment of such a legislative -\r\n\r\n2d - They have exerted that assumed power, in raising a Revenue in\r\nthe Colonies without their consent; thereby depriving them of that\r\nright which every man has to keep his own earnings in his own\r\nhands until he shall in person, or by his Representative, think\r\nfit to part with the whole or any portion of it. This infringement\r\nis the most extraordinary, when we consider the laudable care\r\nwhich the British House of Commons have taken to reserve intirely\r\nand absolutely to themselves the powers of giving and granting\r\nmoneys. They not only insist on originating every money bill in\r\ntheir own house, but will not even allow the House of Lords to\r\nmake an amendment in these bills. So tenacious are they of this\r\nprivilege, so jealous of any infringement of the sole & absolute\r\nright the people have to dispose of their own money. And what\r\nrenders this infringement the more grievous is, that what of our\r\nearnings still remains in our own hands is in a great measure\r\ndeprived of its value, so long as the British Parliament continue\r\nto claim and exercise this power of taxing us; for we cannot\r\nJustly call that our property which others may, when they please\r\ntake away from us against our will. -\r\n\r\nIn this respect we are treated with less decency and regard than\r\nthe Romans shewed even to the Provinces which They had conquered.\r\nThey only determined upon the sum which each should furnish, and\r\nleft every Province to raise it in the manner most easy and\r\nconvenient to themselves -\r\n\r\n3d - A number of new Officers, unknown in the Charter of this\r\nProvince, have been appointed to superintend this Revenue, whereas\r\nby our Charter the Great & General Court or Assembly of this\r\nProvince has the sole right of appointing all civil officers,\r\nexcepting only such officers, the election and constitution of\r\nwhom is in said charter expressly excepted; among whom these\r\nOfficers are not included. -\r\n\r\n4th - These Officers are by their Commission invested with powers\r\naltogether unconstitutional, and entirely destructive to that\r\nsecurity which we have a right to enjoy; and to the last degree\r\ndangerous, not only to our property; but to our lives: For the\r\nCommissioners of his Majestys customs in America, or any three of\r\nthem, are by their Commission impowered,\" by writing under their\r\nhands and seales to constitute and appoint inferior Officers in\r\nall and singular the Port within the limits of their commissions\"\r\nEach of these. petty officers so made is intrusted with power more\r\nabsolute and arbitrary than ought to be lodged in the hands of any\r\nman or body of men whatsoever; for in the commission\r\naforementioned, his Majesty gives & grants unto his said\r\nCommissioners, or any three of them, and to all and every the\r\nCollectors Deputy Collectors, Ministers, Servants, and all other\r\nOfficers serving and attending in all and every the Ports and\r\nother places within the limits of their Commission, full power and\r\nauthority from time to time, at their and any of their wills and\r\npleasures, as well By Night as by day to enter and go on board any\r\nShip, Boat, or other Vessel, riding lying or being within, or\r\ncoming into any Port, Harbour, Creek or Haven, within the limits\r\nof their commission; and also in the day time to go into any\r\nhouse, shop, cellar, or any other place where any goods wares or\r\nmerchandizes lie concealed, or are suspected to lie concealed,\r\nwhereof the customs & other duties, have not been, or shall not\r\nbe, duly paid and truly satisfied, answered or paid unto the\r\nCollectors, Deputy Collectors, Ministers, Servants, and other\r\nOfficers respectively, or otherwise agreed for; and the said\r\nhouse, shop, warehouse, cellar, and other place to search and\r\nsurvey, and all and every the boxes, trunks, chests and packs then\r\nand there found to break open.\" -\r\n\r\nThus our houses and even our bed chambers, are exposed to be\r\nransacked, our boxes chests & trunks broke open ravaged and\r\nplundered by wretches, whom no prudent man would venture to employ\r\neven as menial servants; whenever they are pleased to say they\r\nsuspect there are in the house wares &c for which the dutys have\r\nnot been paid. Flagrant instances of the wanton exercise of this\r\npower, have frequently happened in this and other sea port Towns.\r\nBy this we are cut off from that domestick security which renders\r\nthe lives of the most unhappy in some measure agreable. Those\r\nOfficers may under colour of law and the cloak of a general\r\nwarrant, break thro' the sacred rights of the Domicil, ransack\r\nmens houses, destroy their securities, carry off their property,\r\nand with little danger to themselves commit the most horred\r\nmurders. -\r\n\r\nAnd we complain of it as a further grievance, that notwithstanding\r\nby the Charter of this Province, the Governor and the Great and\r\nGeneral Court or Assembly of this Province or Territory, for the\r\ntime being shall have full power and authority, from time to time,\r\nto make, ordain and establish all manner of wholesome and\r\nreasonable laws, orders, statutes, and ordinances, directions and\r\ninstructions, and that if the same shall not within the term of\r\nthree years after presenting the same to his Majesty in privy\r\ncouncil be disallowed, they shall be and continue in full force\r\nand effect, untill the same shall be repealed by the Great and\r\nGeneral Assembly of this Province: Yet the Parliament of Great\r\nBritain have rendered or attempted to render, null and void a law\r\nof this Province made and passed in the Reign of his late Majesty\r\nGeorge the first, intitled \"An Act stating the Fees of the Custom-\r\nhouse Officers within this Province\" and by meer dint of power, in\r\nviolation of the Charter aforesaid, established other and\r\nexorbitant fees, for the same Officers; any law of the Province to\r\nthe contrary notwithstanding -\r\n\r\n5th - Fleets and Armies have been introduced to support these\r\nunconstitutional Officers in collecting and managing this\r\nunconstitutional Revenue; and troops have been quarter'd in this\r\nMetropolis for that purpose. Introducing and quartering standing\r\nArmies in a free Country in times of peace without the consent of\r\nthe people either by themselves or by their Representatives, is,\r\nand always has been deemed a violation of their rights as freemen;\r\nand of the Charter or Compact made between the King of Great\r\nBritain, and the People of this Province, whereby all the rights\r\nof British Subjects are confirmed to us. -\r\n\r\n6th - The Revenue arising from this tax unconstitutionally laid,\r\nand committed to the management of persons arbitrarily appointed\r\nand supported by an armed force quartered in a free City, has been\r\nin part applyed to the most destructive purposes.  It is\r\nabsolutely necessary in a mixt government like that of this\r\nProvince, that a due proportion or balance of power should be\r\nestablished among the several branches of legislative. Our\r\nAncestors received from King William & Queen Mary a Charter by\r\nwhich it was understood by both parties in the contract, that such\r\na proportion or balance was fixed; and therefore every thing which\r\nrenders any one branch of the Legislative more independent of the\r\nother two than it was originally designed, is an alteration of the\r\nconstitution as settled by the Charter; and as it has been untill\r\nthe establishment of this Revenue, the constant practise of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to provide for the support of Government, so it\r\nis an essential part of our constitution, as it is a necessary\r\nmeans of preserving an equilibrium, without which we cannot\r\ncontinue a free state. -\r\n\r\nIn particular it has always been held, that the dependence of the\r\nGovernor of this Province upon the General Assembly for his\r\nsupport, was necessary for the preservation of this equilibrium;\r\nnevertheless his Majesty has been pleased to apply fifteen hundred\r\npounds sterling annually out of the American revenue, for the\r\nsupport of the Governor of this Province independent of the\r\nAssembly, whereby the ancient connection between him and this\r\npeople is weakened, the confidence in the Governor lessened and\r\nthe equilibrium destroyed, and the constitution essentially\r\naltered. -\r\n\r\nAnd we look upon it highly probable from the best intelligence we\r\nhave been able to obtain, that not only our Governor and\r\nLieuvetenant Governor, but the Judges of the Superior Court of\r\nJudicature, as also the Kings Attorney and Solicitor General are\r\nto receive their support from this Grievous tribute. This will if\r\naccomplished compleat our slavery. For if taxes are raised from us\r\nby the Parliament of Great Britain without our consent, and the\r\nmen on whose opinions and decisions our properties liberties and\r\nlives, in a great measure depend, receive their support from the\r\nRevenues arising from these taxes, we cannot, when we think on the\r\ndepravity of mankind, avoid looking with horror on the danger to\r\nwhich we are exposed? The British Parliament have shewn their\r\nwisdom in making the Judges there as independent as possible both\r\non the Prince and People, both for place and support: But our\r\nJudges hold their Commissions only during pleasure; the granting\r\nthem salaries out of this Revenue is rendering them independent on\r\nthe Crown for their support. The King upon his first accession to\r\nthe Throne, for giving the last hand to the independency of the\r\nJudges in England, not only upon himself but his Successors by\r\nrecommending and consenting to an act of Parliament, by which the\r\nJudges are continued in office, notwithstanding the demise of a\r\nKing, which vacates all other Commissions, was applauded by the\r\nwhole Nation. How alarming must it then be to the Inhabitants of\r\nthis Province, to find so wide a difference made between the\r\nSubjects in Britain and America, as the rendering the Judges here\r\naltogether dependent on the Crown for their support. -\r\n\r\n7th - We find ourselves greatly oppressed by Instructions sent to\r\nour Governor from the Court of Great Britain, whereby the first\r\nbranch of our legislature is made merely a ministerial engine. And\r\nthe Province has already felt such effects from these\r\nInstructions, as We think Justly intitle us to say that they\r\nthreaten an entire destruction of our liberties, and must soon, if\r\nnot checked, render every branch of our Government a useless\r\nburthen upon the people. We shall point out some of the alarming\r\neffects of these Instructions which have already taken place. -\r\n\r\nIn consequence of Instructions, the Governor has called and\r\nadjourned our General Assemblies to a place highly inconvenient to\r\nthe Members and grately disadvantageous to the interest of the\r\nProvince, even against his own declared intention -\r\n\r\nIn consequence of Instructions, the Assembly has been prorogued\r\nfrom time to time, when the important concerns of the Province\r\nrequired their Meeting -\r\n\r\nIn obedience to Instructions, the General Assembly was Anno 1768\r\ndissolved by Governor Bernard, because they would not consent to\r\nrescind the resolution of a former house, and thereby sacrifise\r\nthe rights of their constituents. -\r\n\r\nBy an Instruction, the honourable his Majesty Council are forbid\r\nto meet and transact matters of publick concern as a Council of\r\nadvice to the Governor, unless called by the Governor; and if they\r\nshould from a zealous regard to the interest of the Province so\r\nmeet at any time, the Governor is ordered to negative them at the\r\nnext Election of Councellors. And although by the Charter of this\r\nProvince the Great & General Court have full power and authority\r\nto impose taxes upon the estates and persons of all and every the\r\nproprietors and inhabitants of this Province, yet the Governor has\r\nbeen forbidden to give his consent to act imposing a tax for the\r\nnecessary support of government, unless such persons as were\r\npointed out In the said instruction, were exempted from paying\r\ntheir Just proportion of said tax -\r\n\r\nHis Excellency has also pleaded Instructions for giving up the\r\nprovincial fortress, Castle William into the hands of troops, over\r\nwhom he had declared he had no controul (and that at a time when\r\nthey were menaceing the Slaughter of the Inhabitants of the Town,\r\nand our Streets were stained with the blood which they had\r\nbarbariously shed) Thus our Governor, appointed and paid from\r\nGreat Britain with money forced from us, is made an instrument of\r\ntotally preventing or at least of rendering [futile], every\r\nattempt of the other two branches of the Legislative in favor of a\r\ndistressed and wronged people: And least the complaints naturally\r\noccasioned by such oppression should excite compassion in the\r\nRoyal breast, and induce his Majesty seriously to set about\r\nrelieving us from the cruel bondage and insult which we his loyal\r\nSubjects have so long suffered, the Governor is forbidden to\r\nconsent to the payment of an Agent to represent our grievances at\r\nthe Court of Great Britain, unless he the Governor consent to his\r\nelection, and we very well know what the man must be to whose\r\nappointment a Governor in such circumstances will consent -\r\n\r\nWhile we are mentioning the infringement of the rights of\r\nthis Colony in particular by means of Instructions, we cannot help\r\ncalling to remembrance the late unexampled suspension of the\r\nlegislative of a Sister Colony, New York by force of an\r\nInstruction, untill they should comply with an Arbitrary Act of\r\nthe British Parliament for quartering troops, designed by military\r\nexecution, to enforce the raising of a tribute. -\r\n\r\n8th - The extending the power of the Courts of Vice Admirality to\r\nso enormous a degree as deprives the people in the Colonies in a\r\ngreat measure of their inestimable right to tryals by Juries.,\r\nwhich has ever been Justly considered as the grand Bulwark and\r\nsecurity of English property.\r\n\r\nThis alone is sufficient to rouse our jealousy:And we are again\r\nobliged to take notice of the remarkable contrast, which the\r\nBritish Parliament has been pleased to exhibit between the\r\nSubjects in Great Britain & the Colonies. In the same Statute, by\r\nwhich they give up to the decision of one dependent interested\r\nJudge of Admirality the estates and properties of the Colonists,\r\nthey expressly guard the estates & properties of the people of\r\nGreat Britain; for all forfeitures & penalties inflicted by the\r\nStatute of George the Third, or any other Act of Parliament\r\nrelative to the trade of the Colonies, may be sued for in any\r\nCourt of Admiralty in the Colonies; but all penalties and\r\nforfeitures which shall be incurred in Great Britain, may be sued\r\nfor in any of his Majestys Courts of Record in Westminster or in\r\nthe Court of Exchequer in Scotland, respectively. Thus our Birth\r\nRights are taken from us; and that too with every mark of\r\nindignity, insult and contempt. We may be harrassed and dragged\r\nfrom one part of the Continent to the other (which some of our\r\nBrethren here and in the Country Towns already have been) and\r\nfinally be deprived of our whole property, by the arbitrary\r\ndetermination of one biassed, capricious Judge of the Admirality.\r\n\r\n9th - The restraining us from erecting Stilling Mills for\r\nmanufacturing our Iron the natural produce of this Country, Is an\r\ninfringement of that right with which God and nature have invested\r\nus, to make use of our skill and industry in procuring the\r\nnecessaries and conveniences of life. And we look upon the\r\nrestraint laid upon the manufacture and transportation of Hatts to\r\nbe altogether unreasonable and grievous. Although by the Charter\r\nall Havens Rivers, Ports, Waters, &c. are expressly granted the\r\nInhabitants of the Province and their Successors, to their only\r\nproper use and behoof forever, yet the British Parliament passed\r\nan Act, whereby they restrain us from carrying our Wool, the\r\nproduce of our own farms, even over a ferry; whereby the\r\nInhabitants have often been put to the expence of carrying a Bag\r\nof Wool near an hundred miles by land, when passing over a River\r\nor Water of one quarter of a mile, of which the Province are the\r\nabsolute Proprietors, would have prevented all that trouble. -\r\n\r\n10th - The Act passed in the last Session of the British\r\nParliament, intitled, An Act for the better preserving his\r\nMajestys Dock Yards, Magizines, Ships, Ammunition and Stores, is,\r\nas we apprehend a violent infringement of our Rights. By this Act\r\nany one of us may be taken from his Family, and carried to any\r\npart of Great Britain, there to be tried whenever it shall be\r\npretended that he has been concerned in burning or otherwise\r\ndestroying any Boat or Vessel, or any Materials for building &c.\r\nany Naval or Victualling Store &c. belonging to his Majesty. For\r\nby this Act all Persons in the Realm, or in any of the places\r\nthereto belonging (under which denomination we know the Colonies\r\nare meant to be included) may be indicted and tryed either in any\r\nCounty or Shire within this Realm, in like manner and form as if\r\nthe offence had been committed in said County, as his Majesty and\r\nhis Successors may deem Most expedient. Thus we are not only\r\ndeprived of our grand right to tryal by our Peers in the Vicinity,\r\nbut any Person suspected, or pretended to be suspected, may be\r\nhurried to Great Britain, to take his tryal in any County the King\r\nor his Successors shall please to direct; where, innocent or\r\nguilty he is in great danger of being condemned; and whether\r\ncondemned or acquitted he will probably be ruined by the expense\r\nattending the tryal, and his long absence from his Family and\r\nbusiness; and we have the strongest reason to apprehend that we\r\nshall soon experience the fatal effects of this Act, as about the\r\nyear 1769 the British Parliament passed Resolves for taking up a\r\nnumber of Persons in the Colonies and carrying them to Great\r\nBritain for tryal, pretending that they were authorised so to do,\r\nby a Statute passed in the Reign of Henry the Eighth, in which\r\nthey say the Colonies were included, although the Act was passed\r\nlong before any Colonies were settled, or even in contemplation. -\r\n\r\n11th - As our Ancestors came over to this Country that they might\r\nnot only enjoy their civil but their religeous rights, and\r\nparticularly desired to be free from the Prelates, who in those\r\ntimes cruilly persecuted all who differed in sentiment from the\r\nestablished Church; we cannot see without concern the various\r\nattempts, which have been made and are now making, to establish an\r\nAmerican Episcopate. Our Episcopal Brethren of the Colonies do\r\nenjoy, and rightfully ought ever to enjoy, the free exercise of\r\ntheir religeon, we cannot help fearing that they who are are so\r\nwarmly contending for such an establishment, have views altogether\r\ninconsistent with the universal and peaceful enjoyment of our\r\nchristian privileges: And doing or attempting to do any thing\r\nwhich has even the remotest tendency to endanger this enjoyment,\r\nis Justly looked upon a great grievance, and also an infringement\r\nof our Rights, which is not barely to exercise, but peaceably &\r\nsecurely to enjoy, that liberty wherewith CHRIST has made us free.\r\n\r\nAnd we are further of Opinion, that no power on Earth can justly\r\ngive either temporal or spiritual Jurisdiction within this\r\nProvince, except the Great & General Court. We think therefore\r\nthat every design for establishing the Jurisdiction of a Bishop in\r\nthis Province, is a design both against our Civil and Religeous\r\nrights: And we are well informed, that the more candid and\r\nJudicious of our Brethren of the Church of England in this and the\r\nother Colonies, both Clergy and Laity, conceive of the\r\nestablishing an American Episcopate both unnecessary and\r\nunreasonable. -\r\n\r\n12th - Another Grievance under which we labour is the frequent\r\nalteration of the bounds of the Colonies by decisions before the\r\nKing and Council, explanatory of former grants and Charters. This\r\nnot only subjects Men to live under a constitution to which they\r\nhave not consented, which in itself is a great Grievance; but\r\nmoreover under color, that the right of Soil is affected by such\r\ndeclarations, some Governors, or Ministers, or both in\r\nconjunction, have pretended to Grant in consequence of a Mandamus\r\nmany thousands of Acres of Lands appropriated near a Century past;\r\nand rendered valuable by the labors of the present Cultivators and\r\ntheir Ancestors. There are very notable instances of Setlers, who\r\nhaving first purchased the Soil of the Natives, have at\r\nconsiderable expence obtained confermation of title from this\r\nProvince; and on being transferred to the Jurisdiction of the\r\nProvince of New Hampshire have been put to the trouble and cost of\r\na new Grant or confermation from thence and after all this there\r\nhas been a third declaration of Royal Will, that they should\r\nthence forth be considered as pertaining To the Province of New\r\nYork. The troubles, expences and dangers which hundreds have been\r\nput to on such occasions, cannot here be recited; but so much may\r\nbe said, that they have been most cruelly harrassed, and even\r\nthreatned with a military force, to dragoon them into a\r\ncompliance, with the most unreasonable demands.\r\n\r\nA Letter of Correspondence to the Other Towns.\r\nBoston November 20: 1772\r\n\r\nGentlemen We the Freeholders and other Inhabitants of Boston in\r\nTown Meeting duly Assembled, according to Law, apprehending there\r\nis abundant to be alarmed at14 the plan of Despotism, which the\r\nenemies of our invaluable rights have concerted, is rapidly\r\nhastening to a completion, can no longer conceal our impatience\r\nunder a constant, unremitted, uniform aim to enslave us, or confide in\r\nan Administration which threatens us with certain and inevitable\r\ndestruction. But, when in addition to the repeated inroads made upon\r\nthe Rights and Liberties of the Colonists, and of those in this\r\nProvince in particular, we reflect on the late extraordinary measure\r\nin affixing stipends or Salaries from the Crown to the Offices of the\r\nJudges of the Superior Court of Judicature, making them not only\r\nintirely independent of the people, whose lives and properties are so\r\nmuch in their power, but absolutely dependent on the Crown (which may\r\nhereafter, be worn by a Tyrant) both for their appointment and\r\nsupport, we cannot but be extremely alarmed at the mischievous\r\ntendency of this innovation; which in our opinion is directly contrary\r\nto the spirit of the British Constitution, pregnant with innumerable\r\nevils, and hath a direct tendency To deprive us of every thing\r\nvaluable as Men, as Christians and as Subjects, entitled, by the Royal\r\nCharter, to all the Rights, liberties and privileges of native\r\nBritons. Such being the critical state of this Province, we think it\r\nour duty on this truly distressing occasion, to ask you, What can\r\nwithstand the Attacks of mere power? What can preserve the liberties\r\nof the Subject, when the Barriers of the Constitution are taken away?\r\nThe Town of Boston consulting on the matter above mentioned, thought\r\nproper to make application to the Governor by a Committee; requesting\r\nhis Excellency to communicate such intelligence as he might have\r\nreceived relative to the report of the Judges having their support\r\nindependent of the grants of this Province a Copy of which you have\r\nherewith in Paper N. 1.15 To which we received as answer, the Paper N.\r\n2.16 The Town on further deliberation, thought it advisable to refer\r\nthe matter to the Great and General Assembly; and accordingly in a\r\nsecond address as N. 3.17 they requested his Excellency that the\r\nGeneral Court might Convene at the time to which they then stood\r\nprorogued; to which the Town received the reply as in N. 4.18 in which\r\nwe are acquainted with his intentions further to prorogue the General\r\nAssembly, which has since taken place. Thus Gentlemen it is evident\r\nhis Excellency declines giving the least satisfaction as to the matter\r\nin request. The affair being of publick concernment, the Town of\r\nBoston thought it necessary to consult with their Brethren throughout\r\nthe Province; and for this purpose appointed a Committee, to\r\ncommunicate with our fellow Sufferers, respecting this recent instance\r\nof oppression, as well as the many other violations of our Rights\r\nunder which we have groaned for several Years past - This Committee\r\nhave briefly Recapitulated the sense we have of our invaluable Rights\r\nas Men, as Christians, and as Subjects; and wherein we conceive those\r\nRights to have been violated, which we are desirous may be laid before\r\nyour Town, that the subject may be weighed as its importance requires,\r\nand the collected wisdom of the whole People, as far as possible, be\r\nobtained, on a deliberation of such great and lasting moment as to\r\ninvolve in it the fate of all our Posterity - Great pains has been\r\ntaken to perswade the British Administration to think that the good\r\nPeople of this Province in general are quiet and undisturbed at the\r\nlate measures; and that any uneasiness that appears, arises from a few\r\nfactious designing and disaffected men. This renders it the more\r\nnecessary, that the sense of the People should be explicitly declared.\r\n- A free communication of your sentiments to this Town, of our common\r\ndanger, is earnestly solicited and will be gratefully received. If you\r\nconcur with us in opinion, that our Rights are properly stated, and\r\nthat the several Acts of Parliament, and Measures of Administration,\r\npointed out by us are subversive of these Rights, you will doubtless\r\nthink it of the utmost importance that we stand firm as one man, to\r\nrecover and support them; and to take such measures by directing our\r\nRepresentatives, or otherwise, as your wisdom and fortitude shall\r\ndictate, to rescue from impending ruin our happy and glorious\r\nconstitution. But if it should be the general voice of this Province,\r\nthat the Rights as we have stated them, do not belong to us; or that\r\nthe several measures of Administration in the British Court, are no\r\nviolations of these Rights, or that if they are thus violated or\r\ninfringed, they are not worth contending for, or resolutely\r\nmaintaining; - should this be the general voice of the Province, we\r\nmust be resigned to our wretched fate; but shall forever lament the\r\nextinction of that generous ardor for Civil and Religeous liberty,\r\nwhich in the face of every danger, and even death itself, induced our\r\nfathers to forsake the bosom of their Native Country, and begin a\r\nsettlement on bare Creation - But we trust this cannot be the case: We\r\nare sure your wisdom, your regard to yourselves and the rising\r\nGeneration, cannot suffer you to dose, or set supinely indifferent on\r\nthe brink of destruction, while the Iron hand of oppression is dayly\r\ntearing the choicest Fruit from the fair Tree of Liberty, planted by\r\nour worthy Predecessors, at the expence of their treasure, &\r\nabundantly water'd with their blood - It is an observation of an\r\neminent Patriot, that a People long inured to hardships, loose by\r\ndegrees the very notions of liberty; they look upon themselves as\r\nCreatures at mercy, and that all impositions laid on by superior\r\nhands, are legal and obligatory. - But thank Heaven this is not\r\nyet verified in America! We have yet some share of publick virtue\r\nremaining: we are not afraid of poverty, but disdain slavery. -\r\nThe fate of Nations is so Precarious and revolutions in States so\r\noften take place at an unexpected moment, when the hand of power\r\nby fraud or flattery, has secured every Avenue of retreat, and the\r\nminds of the Subject debased to its purpose, that it becomes every\r\nwell wisher to his Country, while it has any remains of freedom,\r\nto keep an Eagle Eye upon every inovation and stretch of power, in\r\nthose that have the rule over us. A recent instance of this we\r\nhave in the late Revolutions in Sweden, by which the Prince once\r\nsubject to the laws of the State, has been able of a sudden to\r\ndeclare himself an absolute Monarch The Sweeds were once a free,\r\nmartial and valient people: Their minds are now so debaced, that\r\nthey rejoice at being subject to the caprice and arbitrary power\r\nof a Tyrant & kiss their Chains. It makes us shudder to think, the\r\nlate measures of Administration may be productive of the like\r\nCatastrophe; which Heaven forbid! - Let us consider Brethren, we\r\nare struggling for our best Birth Rights & Inheritance; which\r\nbeing infringed, renders all our blessings precarious in their\r\nenjoyments, and consequently trifling in their value. Let us\r\ndisappoint the Men who are raising themselves on the ruin of this\r\nCountry. Let us convince every Invader of our freedom, that we will be\r\nas free as the Constitution our Fathers recognized, will Justify. - 19\r\n\r\n\r\n1 A complete draft of the \"Rights of the Colonists,\" in the\r\nhandwriting of Adams, is in the Committee of Correspondence\r\nPapers, Lenox Library; in the same collection is a copy of the\r\n\"List of Violations,\" said to be in the handwriting of William\r\nEustis, a medical student under Joseph Warren; also in the same\r\ncollection is a draft of the \" Letter of Correspondence,\" with\r\ncorrections in the autograph of Adams.

A--N D-----s.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nThe weakness of an adversary with a man of understanding will\r\nfrequently disarm him of his resentment: Who would chuse to enter the\r\nlists, when even victory is attended with disgrace? A--n D--s as a\r\nHockster of small Wares, within the Bar-room; or laudably vending Milk\r\nand Water, might have grubbed on unnoticed, and not superlatively\r\ncontemptible; but when he so far mistakes his proper department, as to\r\nblunder into the field of politicks, and assume a dictatorial and\r\noffensive part, we are compelled with reluctance to scourge the\r\ninsect, tho' convinced 'tis but an insect still. We are informed by\r\nyour fellow townsman, whom we presume must know you well, that you are\r\ndestitute of feeling; your unexampled effrontery in the publick\r\ntransaction which has unhappily brought you into notice, added to the\r\nconsummate assurance evidenced in the stupid composition to which you\r\nhave tacked your name, are strong circumstances in favour of this\r\nposition But is your modesty truly impregnable? cannot the weapon of\r\nstern rebuke arouse your sensibility? must honest indignation mourn a\r\ndefeat? I intend to try the doubtful experiment, tho' you should\r\nanalize a satyr to be a proof of your general consequence, and extract\r\nincense to your vanity from the blackest records of your shame.\r\n\r\nIn your courageous zeal for the cause of christianity, and the\r\nVirgin Mary, permit me to question your sincerity: It is evident\r\nfrom your notable performance, that you have been acquainted with\r\nthe religious principles and immoral practices of the gentleman so\r\nvery exceptionable to you; for some years past: That he was then\r\nas thorough-paced an infidel as virulent an opposer of our holy\r\nreligion, as he is now: That he was doing discredit to the Bible\r\nthen, or to adopt your own phrase, was undeceiving mankind as\r\nactively as at any time since: That you was acquainted with the\r\nopen profanity of his conversation, and if we may take your word\r\nfor it, was an earwitness of his oaths and execrations: Why did\r\nyou not commence a champion in the cause of christianity some\r\nmonths earlier? it would have had a better appearance, if in your\r\nebullient zeal you had endeavoured to prevent his disseminating\r\nsuch mischievous principles, and seasonably entered your caveat\r\nagainst the pernicious effects of his example. But the cause of\r\nchristianity abstracted from political concerns, was not\r\nsufficient to awaken your resentment: Will not this my dear sir!\r\noccasion suspicions, that all your flaming professions of\r\npatriotism will neither discredit nor remove?\r\n\r\nDoctor Young (I dare you to contradict me) has ever been an\r\nunwearied assertor of the rights of his countrymen: has taken the\r\npost of hazard, and acted vigorously in the cause of American\r\nfreedom: Such endeavours and exertions, have justly entitled him\r\nto the notice, to the confidence of the people; they, from a\r\nthorough conviction of his political integrity have united him\r\nwith several gentlemen, against whom we presume you can have no\r\njust exception, to explain their rights and state their\r\ngrievances; was not your conscience so delicately offensible, I\r\nwould ask such an immaculate christian, whether your ideas of\r\nreprobation extended not only to the whole committee, but to every\r\ntransaction in which they could possibly be employed? If not, are\r\nyou not ashamed of your capricious folly, in rejecting a cause\r\nwhich you profess to have at heart, for the sake of an individual,\r\nagainst whom, your spotless purity has matter of objection.\r\n\r\nShall I be arraigned for want of charity, if I here express my\r\ndoubt of your veracity in this matter? The cloak of christianity\r\nis the threadbare garb of hypocrisy; and novel cover for political\r\napostates: I suspect 't is the cause that renders the man obnoxious;\r\nthe infidel might have perverted the world, and your zeal been\r\nsmothered in its native bosom of sanctity: in short, had not the\r\ncause of liberty found a busy advocate in the man you brand with\r\nirreligion, your abhorrence would probably never have found a tongue.\r\n\r\nYou do not chuse to have any thing to do with measures wherein you\r\nmust follow the lead of such men as Dr. Young: I apprehend you\r\nconfine yourself here to political matters; if so, what must those\r\nrejected measures be? if just, right and reasonable, the man must\r\nbe an incorrigible blockhead to reject them, let them originate\r\nwhere they will: if on the contrary, they are improper and\r\nexceptionable; you might have discountenanced the measure, without\r\nvillifying the man.\r\n\r\nInconsiderable and weak as I esteem you, you have still an\r\ninterest in the constitutional claims of an English subject, equal\r\nto a nobleman, equal to an intelligent being: these you have no\r\nright to sacrifice even to your own predominant folly. You assert\r\nthat you are, and ever have been as steady a friend to the rights\r\nand privileges of your country, as any man whatsoever, &c. what\r\nthen is that exact point of difference, that chaste line of\r\ndecorum, to which your love of your country will carry you, and no\r\nfurther? all those concerned in consulting and labouring for the\r\nredemption of their country, must be very exemplary christians, or\r\nyour patriotism hangs so loosely about you, that your country may\r\nperish rather than you will unite for its salvation, with a man\r\nnot compleatly orthodox: For no political measures can possibly be\r\nreasonable or just, which are not dictated by men of piety and\r\nreal christianity: The truth of this observation will appear with\r\npeculiar lustre, when we consider what a paultry figure, those\r\nantient heathenish states of Greece and Rome made in the primitive\r\nages. You elsewhere shrewdly remark, that it has always been\r\nastonishing to the world, how any important trusts came to be\r\ncommitted to Doctor Young; the best account that can be given for\r\nit, YOU BELIEVE is, that he has appeared ready to lead in such\r\nbold and exceptional measures, as rather savoured of faction, than\r\nboded any good to the public: which is in plain English, that because\r\nthe measures he proposed, were dangerous and exceptionable, Therefore\r\nthe town approved and confided in him. To wave the illiberal slander\r\nupon the town; I question, most christian sir! whether any article of\r\nDoctor Young's CREED will shock decency and common sense more than\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nThe present crisis is truly an alarming one to your country; the\r\nfew friends of the people have abundant necessity to have their\r\nhands strengthened: the man who deserts now, is the worst enemy of\r\nhis country: You sir! have done this, with the aggravated guilt of\r\nendeavouring to load with obloquy the cause you abandon - I scorn\r\nto keep terms with a man I esteem so base - You have provided\r\nyourself a Retreat, being assured of the smiles of power; nay\r\nmore, you are entitled to their favour, for the rank injury you\r\nmeant to the oppressed people; and we shall probably see such\r\nbaseness distinguished in the commissioned scroll of SCOUNDRELLS\r\nand RESCINDERS.\r\n\r\nVINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 The following note by the publishers is printed with this article:\r\n“Dr. Young's Letter to Mr. Aaron Davis, Jun. should have had a\r\nPlace in this Day's Paper had we not been pre engaged with the\r\nfollowing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ARTHUR LEE.\r\n\r\n[R. H. Lee, Life of Arthur Lee, vol. ii., pp. 196, 197.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, Nov. 31st, 1772.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR, - My last letter to you was of the 3d inst. I now\r\nenclose the proceedings of this town at a meeting appointed to\r\nreceive the report of the committee, which is attested by the\r\ntown-clerk, and published by order of the town.\r\n\r\nOur enemies are taking all imaginable pains to disparage the\r\nproceedings, and prevent their having any effect in the country.\r\nThey are particularly endeavouring to have it believed, that the\r\nvote was carried at a very thin meeting; and in the Court Gazette\r\nof last week have had the assurance to say, that there were not\r\nmore than twenty persons present, and that not ten voted for it;\r\nwhereas it was much such a meeting, or rather fuller than the\r\nlast. The town of Roxbury, adjacent to this, have met, and against\r\nthe efforts of the whole cabal have raised a committee of nine\r\npersons to take our proceedings into consideration, and report at\r\nan adjournment; having before voted the independency of the\r\njudges, \"a most dangerous innovation.\" Plymouth, another large\r\ntown, forty miles distant, has also met, but we have not yet heard\r\nwhat has been done there;1 from the spirit of the petitions to\r\ntheir selectmen for a meeting, among the enclosed papers, I hope\r\nto send you an agreeable account. Other towns are in motion of\r\ntheir accord, for our pamphlet is not yet sent into the country towns,\r\nRoxbury excepted. The conspirators are very sensible that if our\r\ndesign succeeds, there will be an apparent union of sentiments among\r\nthe people of this province, which may spread through the continent.\r\nYou cannot then wonder that their utmost skill is employed to oppose\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI intended to have sent my last by Capt. Scott, but having failed\r\nin that design, I herewith enclose it. I am disappointed if I do\r\nnot receive a letter from you by every vessel that arrives here.\r\nBe assured that I am with great esteem sir, your humble servant,\r\n\r\n\r\n1 See below, page 394.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ELBRIDGE GERRY.\r\n\r\n[J.

I shall lay it before our\r\ncommittee as soon as may be. Hope you have had a happy meeting\r\nthis day, and rest with esteem,\r\n\r\nSir, your friend,\r\nMonday, 10 o'clock evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 J.

If any Consideration has\r\nbrot you to a Resolution no longer to keep up an Epistolary\r\nConversation with me, I must on my part cease; but while I remember\r\nformer Connections, I shall never forget the only surviving Branch of\r\na Family I loved, and shall make my self as happy as possible, in\r\nsilently wishing the best Welfare of him whose Regards I think I have\r\nnot forfeited.\r\n\r\nIt is not an easy thing at this time of my Life, to put me out of the\r\npossession of my self. I have been used to the alternate Frowns &\r\nSmiles of many who call themselves, & some of them in truth are my\r\nFriends. I bear it all with OEquanimity, infinitely better pleasd with\r\nthe Approbation of my own mind, than I should be with the flatteries\r\nof the Great, & in the Sunshine of power. Those who love this Country,\r\nI have the Vanity to think are in Reality, my friends; for they must\r\nbe convincd that the small Share of Ability which Gracious Heaven has\r\nbeen pleasd to bestow on me, has ever been employd for its Happiness.\r\nIf I have mistaken its true Happiness (which by the Way I think I have\r\nnot) it belongs to the Candid to overlook it; the Opinion of others I\r\nvery little regard, & have a thorough Contempt for all men, be their\r\nNames Characters & Stations what they may, who appear to be the\r\nirreclaimable Enemies of Religion & Liberty. Had I not thought it\r\nwould have been rather an Inconvenience to you, I should have sent\r\nyou the last Week the Votes & proceedings of your native town; If I\r\ncan be informd by you that it will not be disagreable, I will send you\r\na printed Copy by the next post.\r\n\r\nAltho I have already transgressd the Bounds of a Letter to so great a\r\nStranger, yet having a warm friendship for Mrs Checkley, I cannot help\r\ndesiring you to make mention of my own & my family regards to her.\r\nHaving said this I must beg you to believe, whatever others may have\r\nwhisperd to the Contrary, that I am Yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Addressed, \"in the Customs, Providence.\" Cf. Literary Diary of\r\nEzra Stiles, vol. i., p. 58.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE SIGNED \"CANDIDUS.\"\r\n\r\n[Boston Gazette, December 14, 1772.]\r\n\r\nTo the PRINTERS,\r\n\r\nNOTWITHSTANDING the ministerial Tools have so often puff'd upon\r\nthe Impartiality of the Court Gazette, we have had a second\r\nInstance of the Necessity the Selectmen of this Town have thought\r\nthemselves under to vindicate the Cause of Liberty & Truth, from\r\nthe gross Misrepresentation of well known Facts that have been\r\nmade in that immaculate Paper. If Mr. Draper had had the least\r\nInclination to have ascertained the Falsehood of the Paragraph\r\ninserted in his Paper of the 26th of November, it was so\r\nnotorious, that without giving the Selectmen the Trouble of it, he\r\nmight have done it himself, by enquiring of perhaps the first\r\nhonest Man he had met in the Street: But it was calculated to\r\nmislead the Reader into a Belief, that \"not ten Persons voted for\r\nsending the Letter of Correspondence\" into the Country, and\r\ntherefore it must, to answer so good a Purpose, be inserted in that\r\n\"circulating\" Gazette, whether true or false; and the Publisher, very\r\ndemurely, by Way of Atonement, after the Falsehood is detected,\r\npromises the injur'd Publick \" to enquire into the Foundation\r\nof it.\"-!!!\r\n\r\nIn his last Gazette he informs his Readers that he had accordingly\r\napply'd to his Author; who, he says, \"does not deny the Number\r\npresent\" at the Meeting \"as declared by the Selectmen when the\r\nfirst Vote pass'd.\" Now the Selectmen declare, \"that a respectable\r\nNumber of the Inhabitants attended the Meeting through the Day,\r\nand when the Letter, after being twice read and amended in the\r\nMeeting was voted, and accepted to be sent, it appeared to them,\r\nand they are well satisfied, that there was not less than three\r\nHundred Inhabitants present, and in the Opinion of others the\r\nNumber was much larger\"; which is undoubtedly the Fact. But Mr.\r\nDraper's Author of the Note (if he had any) had said that \"when\r\nthe Votes pass'd for sending the letter, there was not twenty Men\r\npresent besides the Gentlemen Selectmen & some of the Committee\".\r\nThe Contradiction appear'd so glaring even in Mr. Draper's eyes,\r\nas well as others, that after he had publish'd it to the World, he\r\nthought his own Reputation concern'd, as indeed it was, to enquire\r\ninto the Foundation of the Report, which he ought to have done\r\nbefore. The Man of Verity his Author, makes a shift to tell him,\r\nthat truly \"it was a Vote that pass'd half an Hour after Nine\r\no'Clock that he meant in his Note, when most of the Inhabitants\r\nhad withdrawn\"; but he does not now say what Vote he meant in his\r\nNote, though when he reported it \"with some Confidence\" he plumply\r\nsaid it was the Vote for sending the Letter. The Man who is\r\nresolv'd to serve a Party at the expence of Truth, should have the\r\nbest of Memories; the want of which has render'd the Court Writers\r\noftentimes inconsistent with themselves and with each other. But\r\nwhat else are we to expect from Champions of a Cause which has\r\nonly the feeble Props of Misrepresentation and low Artifice to\r\nsupport it! As this Author reported according to Draper with some\r\nConfidence, he ought to have inform'd himself of a known Fact,\r\nthat the question debated at half an Hour after Nine o'Clock, as\r\nhe now says, or at about Ten as he had asserted in his Note, was\r\nnot whether the Letter should be sent to the Selectmen of the\r\nTowns in the Country; - That had been determin'd by a full Vote\r\nNem. Con. before \"most of the Inhabitants had withdrawn \". It was\r\nafter this Vote had pass'd, and when it is allow'd the Meeting was\r\nthin, a Question of much less Importance than the other was\r\ndebated, viz. In what Manner the Letter should be sent; upon which\r\nit was agreed that the Town-Clerk should sign and forward it by\r\nthe Direction of the Committee.1 Accordingly, I am well assured,\r\nit has been forwarded to four fifths of the Gentlemen Selectmen in\r\nthe Country, the representatives of the several Towns, the Members\r\nof his Majesty's Council and others of Note, by the Direction of\r\nthe Committee, in Pursuance of the Vote of the Town, with less\r\nExpence for Carriage than two Dollars.  I have a better Opinion of\r\nthe good Sense of the People of this Country, than to believe they\r\nwill be diverted from an Attention to Matters which essentially\r\nconcern their own and their Childrens best Birthrights, and which\r\nevery Day become more serious and alarming, by the Trifles that\r\nare every Week thrown out perhaps with that very Design in the\r\nCourt Gazette more especially. The Ax is laid at the Root of our\r\nhappy civil Constitution: Our religious Rights are threatned:\r\nThese important Matters are the Subjects of the Letter of this\r\nTown to our Friends and Fellow Sufferers in the Country. Whether\r\nthere were present at the Meeting three Hundred or three Thousand,\r\nit was a legal Meeting: As legal as a Meeting of the General\r\nAssembly convened by the King's Writ or a Meeting of his Majesty's\r\nCouncil summoned by his Excellency the Governor: This I say with\r\ndue respect to those great Assemblies. The Selectmen, among whom\r\nis the honorable Gentleman who was Moderator2 of the Meeting, have\r\ncondescended to publish it under their Hands, that \"a very\r\nrespectable Number attended the Meeting through the Day\":-If it\r\nhad been as thin a Meeting as Mr. Draper's Writers would fain have\r\nthe Country think it was, still, being a legal Meeting, their\r\nproceedings according to the Warrant for calling it, would have\r\nbeen as legal as those of his Majesty's Council when seven\r\nGentlemen only (which Number by the Charter constitutes a Quorum)\r\nout of their whole Number, Twenty-Eight, happen to be present. If\r\nthe Generality of my Countrymen shall think those Proceedings to\r\nbe of any Importance to them, and shall act upon them with their\r\nown good Sense and Understanding, I care not who concern themselves\r\nin adjusting the private, moral or religious Characters of Dr. Young\r\nand the Lieutenant Governor. The part which each of these Gentlemen\r\nhas acted upon the political Stage is well known.\r\n\r\nI would just observe to Mr. Draper, that the Name of the Gentleman\r\nwho furnish'd him with the Note before refer'd to, is perhaps not\r\nso deep a Secret as he may imagine it to be. It may be, he had then no\r\nthought that a Story inadvertently told, would have been immediately\r\nwork'd up by the Press: This however has been done, and the Publick\r\nhas been thereby abused: It should make one cautious not too suddenly\r\nto communicate any Piece of Intelligence, especially of Importance,\r\nand still more especially of political Importance, to one whose\r\nBusiness it is to publish what he hears. Mr. Draper may flatter\r\nhimself that \"the Credit of his Paper has not yet suffered\": It is\r\nsometimes not an easy thing, to perswade a Man to believe that to be\r\ntrue, which he wishes may not be true: It must needs be difficult to\r\nestablish in the minds of impartial Men, the Reputation of a Paper,\r\nthe Publisher of which (to use the mild, very mild Expressions of the\r\nSelectmen) \"has suffered \", it may be said repeatedly, \"what was so\r\ndifferent from the fact to be inserted,\" before he \"had Opportunity to\r\nbe very particular in his Inquiries about it; especially as it was a\r\nMatter, by his own Concession, so interesting to the People in the\r\nCountry, as that \"they ought to be satisfied whether the Report be\r\ntrue or false\". This, we hope, by the Interposition of the Selectmen\r\nis now done; and it was the more necessary, because the same Gentleman\r\nwho furnished Mr. Draper with the Note, as he calls it, had related\r\nthe story which is now detected, to a Person going, and since gone\r\ninto a distant Country in this Province.\r\n\r\nWhether Mr. Draper in the Conclusion of what he inserted in his\r\nlast, sign'd the Printer, had an Intention obliquely to reflect on\r\nthe Honor of the Selectmen, those Gentlemen, if they please will\r\nconsider.\r\n\r\nCANDIDUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Record commissioners' Report, vol. xviii., p. 94.\r\n2 John Hancock, Esq;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ELBRIDGE GERRY.\r\n\r\n[J. T. Austin, Life of Elbridge Gerry, vol. i., pp. 23-25.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, Dec. 23, 1772.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nThe further proceedings of the truly patriotic town of Marblehead,\r\ntogether with your own esteemed favours of the 16th and 21st\r\ninstant, came to my hand in due season, The proceedings I\r\nimmediately communicated to our chairman; and from your hint that\r\nit was thought proper to suspend the publication, together with\r\nassurances of letters from some other towns speedily, we agreed\r\nalso to suspend the calling a meeting of our committee, which\r\nhowever will be done soon. Agreeably to the intimations in your\r\nlast I find in the Essex Gazette1 a, - what shall I call it? a\r\ndisapprobation, to use their own term, signed by a few men, of the\r\nproceedings of a whole town. If \"in fact there was but about twenty\r\npersons who voted at the meeting\" and all the rest were against the\r\nmeasure, I wonder much that they did not follow the example of so\r\neminent a person as the single dissentient and outvote you when\r\nthey had it in their power. Or why could not the twenty-nine\r\ndisapprobators have attended the meeting the second time and prevented\r\nyour taking such measures from which they \"are apprehensive the town\r\nwill incur a great deal of public censure\"? This would indeed have\r\nbeen meritorious. I am a stranger to most of the gentlemen who have\r\nthus signalized themselves; Mr. Mansfield I once thought a zealous\r\nwhig, perhaps I was mistaken. After all, the whole seems to be but a\r\nweak effort; their third reason appears to me so excessively puerile,\r\nthat I am surprised that gentlemen of character could deliberately set\r\ntheir hands to it.\r\n\r\nYour last proceedings sent to us in manuscript are attested by the\r\ntown clerk. I am sorry to observe that the printed copy in the Essex\r\nGazelle is without his attestation, because an advantage may be made\r\nof it in our Court Gazette to lessen its credit and authority; to\r\nprevent which I intend the next Monday's papers shall have it from the\r\nmanuscript unless (which I cannot much expect) I shall be otherwise\r\nadvised by you.\r\n\r\nI was thinking that you might turn the tables upon your disapprobating\r\nfriends, by getting a much larger subscription from persons who were\r\nnot at the meeting and approve of the proceedings. Whether it be\r\nprudent or worth while to try this method you must certainly be a\r\nbetter judge than I am.\r\n\r\nThe tools of power, little and great, are taking unwearied pains to\r\nprevent the meeting of the towns, but they do not succeed altogether\r\nto their wishes. I cannot help entertaining some sanguine hopes that\r\nthe measures we have pursued will have a happy event.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Published at Salem, by S. and E.

The Subject is weighty, &\r\nrequires more of my Attention than a few Hours, to give you my\r\ndigested Sentiments of it; neither have I yet had an Opportunity of\r\nadvising with the few among my Acquaintances, whom I would chuse to\r\nconsult upon a Matter, which in my Opinion may involve the Fate of\r\nAmerica. This, I intend soon to do; and shall then, I hope, be able\r\nto communicate to you (before the Time you have set shall expire) such\r\nThoughts, as in your Judgment, may perhaps be wise and salutary on so\r\npressing an Occasion. Thus much however seems to me to be obvious at\r\nfirst View; that the whole Act of Parliament so far as it relates to\r\nthe Colonies, & consequently the Commission which is founded upon it,\r\nis against the first Principles of Government and the English\r\nConstitution, Magna Charta & many other Acts of Parliament,\r\ndeclaratory of the Rights of the Subject; & therefore the Guardians\r\nof the Rights of the Subject will consider whether it be not their\r\nDuty, so far from giving the least Countenance to the Execution of it,\r\nto declare it, ipso Facto null & Void. This Commission seems to be\r\nsubstituted in the Room of a Grand Jury, which is one of the greatest\r\nBulwarks of the Liberty of the Subject; instituted for the very\r\nPurpose of preventing Mischeife being done by false Accusers. By the\r\nAct of Parliament of the 25th of Ed. 3d (in the true Sense of the\r\nWords the best of Kings) it is establishd, that none shall be taken by\r\nSuggestion made to the King or his Council (which seems to me to be\r\nthe present Point) unless it be by Indictment or Presentment of good &\r\nlawful People of the same Neighbourhood, where such Deeds be done -\r\nAnd, \"if any thing be done against the same it shall be redressd &\r\nholden for none.\" But certain Persons proscribd in the Colony of Rhode\r\nIsland, are to be taken without such Indictment or Presentment, &\r\ncarried away from the Neighborhood where Deeds unlawful are suggested\r\nto the King to have been committed, & there put to answer contrary to\r\nthat Law, which even so long ago was held to be the old Law of the\r\nLand. - One Reason given in the Act for taking away that accursed\r\nCourt called the Star Chamber was, because all Matters examinable &\r\ndeterminable before that Court might have their due Punishment and\r\nCorrection by the Common Law of the Land and in the ordinary Course of\r\nJustice elsewhere. But here seems to be a stopping of the ordinary\r\nCourse of Justice; & by setting up a Court of Enquiry founded upon\r\na Suggestion of evil Deeds made to the King & of certain Persons\r\nsupposd to be concernd therein, Jurisdiction is given to others than\r\nthe constituted ordinary Courts of Justice, & in a Way other than the\r\nordinary Course of the Law, that is, an arbitrary Way to examine &\r\ndraw into Question Matters & things which, by the Act for regulating\r\nthe privy Council it is declared, that neither his Majesty nor his\r\nprivy Council have or ought to have any Jurisdiction Power or\r\nAuthority to do. In short, this Measure appears to me to be repugnant\r\nto the first Principles of natural Justice. The interrested Servants\r\nof the Crown, and some of them pensiond, perhaps byassd & corrupted\r\nbeing the constituted Judges, whether this or that Subject shall be\r\nput to answer for a supposd Offence against the Crown, & that in a\r\ndistant Country, to their great Detriment & Danger of Life & Fortune,\r\neven if their Innocence shd be made to appear. What Man is safe from\r\nthe malicious Prosecution of such Persons, unless it be the cringing\r\nSycophant, and even he holds his Life and Property at their Mercy. It\r\nshould awaken the American Colonies, which have been too long dozing\r\nupon the Brink of Ruin. It should again unite them in one Band. Had\r\nthat Union which once happily subsisted been preservd, the\r\nConspirators against our Common Rights would never have venturd such\r\nbold Attempts. It has ever been my Opinion, that an Attack upon the\r\nLiberties of one Colony is an Attack upon the Liberties of\r\nall; and therefore in this Instance all should be ready to yield\r\nAssistance to Rhode Island. But an Answer to the most material Part of\r\nyour Letter must be referd, for the Reasons I have given, to another\r\nOpportunity. In the mean time I am with due Regards to the Gentlemen\r\nwho have honord me with their Letter\r\n\r\nYour assured Friend & very hbl Servt\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Of Providence, R. I.

A copy is in S. A. Wells, Samuel Adams and the American\r\nRevolution, vol. i., pp. 363-365. A copy of a letter, under date of\r\nFebruary 15, 1773, from Sessions, Hopkins, Cole, and Brown to Adams,\r\nacknowledging the receipt of three letters from Adams in response to\r\ntheir letter of December 25, 1772, is in ibid., pp. 370, 371. In this\r\nletter to Adams his correspondents comment as follows: \"At or about\r\nthe time we wrote you, we transmitted copies of the same to several\r\ngentlemen in North America, from the most of whom we have received\r\nanswers, agreeing nearly in sentiments, with those you were pleased to\r\ncommunicate to us though no one has entered into a disquisition of the\r\nsubject so fully and satisfactorily as you have.\" The original letter\r\nis also in the Lenox Library.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMITTEE OF CORRESPONDENCE OF BOSTON TO\r\nTHE COMMITTEE OF CORRESPONDENCE OF CAMBRIDGE.1\r\n\r\n[MS., Committee of Correspondence Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON Decr 29 1772\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN\r\n\r\nYour cordial Approbation2 of our sincere Endeavors for the Common\r\nSafety, affords us great Encouragement to persevere with Alacrity in\r\nthe Execution of our Trust. Our hands have been abundantly strengthend\r\nby the generous and manly Resolves of our worthy Brethren in the\r\nseveral Towns who have hitherto acted.\r\n\r\nShould such Sentiments, which we are convincd generally prevail\r\nthrough the province, be as generally expressd, it must refute the\r\ninsidious misrepresentation so industriously propagated on both sides\r\nof the Atlantick, that the people have not Virtue enough to resist the\r\nEfforts made to enslave them! It affords us the greatest Satisfaction\r\nto find the Opportunity offerd to our Fellow Countrymen to wipe off so\r\nignominious a Reproach so readily embraced. We trust in God, & in the\r\nSmiles of Heaven on the Justice of our Cause, that a Day is hastening,\r\nwhen the Efforts of the Colonists will be crownd with Success; and the\r\npresent Generation furnish an Example of publick Virtue, worthy the\r\nImitation of all Posterity. In this we are greatly encouraged, from\r\nthe thorough Understanding of our civil & Religious Rights Liberties &\r\nPrivileges, throughout this province: The Importance of which is so\r\nobvious, that we are satisfied, nothing we can offer, would strengthen\r\nyour Sense of it.\r\n\r\nIt gives us Pleasure to be assured from you, that the meetings of the\r\nTown of Cambridge on the Occasion have been so respectable; as, in our\r\nOpinion, it is an Evidence of their virtuous Attachment to the Cause\r\nof Liberty.\r\n\r\nIt shall be our constant Endeavor to collect and communicate to our\r\nesteemed fellow Countrymen every Interresting Information we can\r\nprocure; in pursuance thereof we take the Liberty to inclose, a\r\nmaterial Extract of a Letter from the Right Honorable the Earl of\r\nDartmouth to his Honor the Governor of Rhode Island, Dated White Hall,\r\nSept. 7 1772; which we have good reason to assure you is genuine.3\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Addressed to \"Capt Ebenezer Stedman & others, a Committee of\r\nCorrespondence in\r\nCambridge.\"\r\n2 Boston Gazette, December 28, 1772.\r\n3 The form of signature is \"Signd by order of the Committee for\r\nCorrespondence in Boston William Cooper, Clerk.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMITTEE OF CORRESPONDENCE OF BOSTON TO\r\nTHE COMMITTEE OF CORRESPONDENCE OF PLYMOUTH.1\r\n\r\n[MS., Committee of Correspondence Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON Decr 29 1772\r\n\r\nMUCH RESPECTE'D GENTLEMEN\r\n\r\nWe the Committee of Correspondence for the Town of Boston, have\r\nreceivd your kind Letters inclosing the noble & patriotick Resolves of\r\nthe Metropolis of the ancient Colony of Plymouth.\r\n\r\nIt must give singular Pleasure to the friends of this Country to find\r\nin all times of Difficulty & Danger, the worthy Inhabitants of\r\nPlymouth, [are] ready to assert the natural religious & civil Rights\r\nof the Colonists in general & of this by a new Charter united province\r\nin particular.\r\n\r\nYour thorough knowledge of those Rights the Sense you have of the many\r\nlate Infractions thereof, the manly & becoming Spirit with which you\r\nhave always expressd your selves on such Occasions, must best appear\r\nwithout any Comment, from your Resolves for a number of years past;\r\nmore especially your last which are before the publick Eye.\r\n\r\nWe heartily congratulate you on the return of that great Anniversary,\r\nthe landing of the first Settlers at Plymouth, & on the religious &\r\nrespectful Manner, in which it has been celebrated.\r\n\r\nYou may say without Vanity, and surely we may affirm without any such\r\nImputation, that a handful of persecuted brave people, then made way\r\nfor the extensive Settlement of New England: That had it not been for\r\ntheir Efforts, Virginia would have soon been abandoned: That the\r\nFrench who were then settled at Quebec; & the Dutch interloping in\r\nHudsons River with the Assistance they might have derived from the\r\nNatives, and the Aid at all times ready to be afforded, by the Crown\r\nof Spain, then in possession of South America, against the Crown of\r\nEngland, would have availd themselves of all the Continent of North\r\nAmerica. And that at this very period Great Britain might have thought\r\nherself well off, with such trifling Islands as are now in the\r\npossession of the Dane. In pursuance of our Instruction from this Town\r\nto communicate any new Infractions of our Rights & Liberties we\r\ninclose an Extract of a Letter from Lord Dartmouth to the Governor of\r\nRhode Island & shall take the earliest Opportunity to advise you of\r\nevery thing Important that may occur to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Addressed to \"Joseph Warren Esq & others a Committee of Correspondence for the\r\nTown of Plymouth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DARIUS SESSIONS.\r\n\r\n[MS., Samuel Adams Papers, Lenox Library.]\r\n\r\nBOSTON Jan 2 1773.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI wrote you on Monday last acknowledging the Receipt of a Letter\r\ndirected to me from your self & other worthy Gentlemen in Providence.\r\nThe Question proposed was in what manner your Colony had best behave\r\nin this critical Situation & how the Shock that is coming upon it may\r\nbe best evaded or sustaind. It appears to me probable that the\r\nAdministration has a design to get your Charter vacated. The\r\nExecution of so extraordinary a Commission, unknown in your Charter &\r\nabhorrent to the principles of every free Government, wherein Persons\r\nare appointed to enquire into Offences committed against a Law of\r\nanother Legislature, with the Power of transporting the persons they\r\nshall suspect beyond the Seas to be tryed, would essentially change\r\nyour Constitution; and a Silence under such a Change would be\r\nconstrued a Submission to it. At the same time it must be considerd\r\nthat an open declaration of the Assembly against the Appointment &\r\norder of the King, in which he is supported by an Act of the British\r\nParliament, would be construed by the Law Servants of the Crown &\r\nother ministers such a Defiance of the Royal Authority, as they would\r\nadvise proper to be recommended to the Consideration & Decision of\r\nParliament. Should your Governor refuse to call the Commissioners\r\ntogether, or when called together, the civil magistrates\r\nrefuse to take measures for arresting & committing to Custody such\r\npersons as upon Information made shall be chargd with being concernd\r\nin burning the Gaspee, or if they should issue their precepts for that\r\npurpose the Officers should refuse to execute them, the Event would be\r\nperhaps the same as in the Case of an open Declaration before\r\nmentiond, for in all these Cases it would be represented to the King &\r\nthe parliament that it was to be attributed to what they will call\r\nthe overbearing popularity of your Government, & the same pretence\r\nwould be urgd for the Necessity of an Alteration in order to support\r\nthe Kings Authority in the Colony. As the chiefe Object in the View of\r\nAdministration seems to be the vacating your Charter, I cannot think\r\nthe Commissioners in case they should meet together, would upon any of\r\nthe aforementiond Occasions, chuse to call upon General Gage for the\r\nAid of the Troops or make any more than the Shew of a Readiness to\r\nexecute their Commission; for they might think the grand purpose\r\nwould be sufficiently answerd without their Discussing such danger to\r\ntheir Reputation, if not their persons. If the foregoing Hypotheses\r\nare well grounded, I think it may be justly concluded that since the\r\nConstitution is already destined to suffer unavoidable Dissolution, an\r\nopen & manly Determination of the Assembly not to consent to its ruin\r\nwould show to the World & posterity that the people were virtuous\r\nthough unfortunate, & sustaind the Shock with Dignity.\r\n\r\nYou will allow me to observe, that this is a Matter in which the whole\r\nAmerican Continent is deeply concernd and a Submission of the Colony\r\nof Rhode Island to this enormous Claim of power would be made a\r\nPrecedent for all the rest; they ought indeed to consider deeply their\r\nInterest in the Struggle of a single Colony & their Duty to afford her\r\nall practicable Aid. This last is a Consideration which I shall not\r\nfail to mention to my particular friends when our Assembly shall sit\r\nthe next Week.\r\n\r\nShould it be the determination of a weak Administration to push this\r\nMeasure to the utmost at all Events, and the Commissioners call in the\r\nAid of troops for that purpose it would be impossible for me to say\r\nwhat might be the Consequence, Perhaps a most violent political\r\nEarthquake through the whole British Empire if not its total\r\nDestruction.\r\n\r\nI have long feard that this unhappy Contest between Britain & America\r\nwill end in Rivers of Blood; Should that be the Case, America I think\r\nmay wash her hands in Innocence; yet it is the highest prudence to\r\nprevent if possible so dreadful a Calamity. Some such provocation as\r\nis now offerd to Rhode Island will in all probability be the immediate\r\nOccasion of it. Let us therefore consider whether in the present Case\r\nthe Shock that is coming upon you may not be evaded which is\r\na distinct part of the Question proposed. For this purpose, if your\r\nGovernor should omit to call the Commissioners together, in\r\nConsequence of a representation made to him by the Assembly, that the\r\nInnovation appears to them of a most dangerous Tendency; and\r\naltogether needless, inasmuch as the same Enquiry might be made as\r\neffectually (and doubtless would be) by a Grand Jury, as is proposed\r\nto be made by the Commissioners; which would be agreable to the\r\nConstitution & in the ordinary Course of Justice. A representation of\r\nthis kind made by the Assembly to the Governor, would afford him a\r\nreasonable plea for suspending the Matter till he could fully state\r\nthe Matter to Lord Dartmouth & the odious light in which the\r\nCommission is viewd by that & the other Colonies as a measure\r\nincompatible with the English Constitution & the Rights of the\r\nColonists together with the fatal Consequences of which it might\r\nprobably be productive. This perhaps could not be done till the rising\r\nof Parliament, & before the next Session a war or some other important\r\nEvent might take place which would bury this Affair in Oblivion. Or if\r\nit should ever come before Parliament in this Manner, the Delay on the\r\npart of the Governor would appear to be made upon motives of sound\r\nprudence & the best Advice which would tend to soften their Spirits.\r\nAnd besides, its appearing to be founded not directly on the\r\nprinciples of Opposition to the Authority of Parliament, the sacred\r\nImportance of Charters upon which many of the Members hold their\r\nSeats, might be considerd without prejudice, & the Matter might\r\nsubside even in Parliament. Should that be the Case it would\r\ndisappoint the designs & naturally abate the Rigour of Administration\r\n& so the Shock might be evaded.\r\n\r\nIf, without being called together by Governor Wanton who is first\r\nnamed, the rest of the Commissioners should meet upon the Business of\r\ntheir Commission, which I cannot suppose they will do, especially if\r\nthe Governor should acquaint them with the Reason of his not calling\r\nthem, it would show a forward Zeal to execute an order new arbitrary &\r\nuniversally odious, & how far that might justly insence the people\r\nagainst them personally, & lessen them in the Esteem of all\r\njudicious Men, they would do well calmly to consider; and how far also\r\nthey would be answerable for the fatal Effects that might follow such\r\na forwardnesss all the world and Posterity will judge: For such an\r\nEvent as this will assuredly go down to future Ages in the page of\r\nHistory, & the Colony & all concernd in it will be characterizd by the\r\npart they shall act in the Tragedy. Upon the whole it is my humble\r\nOpinion, that the grand Purpose of Administration is either to\r\nintimidate the Colony into a Compliance with a Measure destructive of\r\nthe freedom of their Constitution, or to provoke them to such a Step\r\nas shall give a pretext for the Vacation of their Charter which I\r\nshould think must sound like Thunder in the Ears of Connecticutt\r\nespecially. Whatever Measures the Wisdom of your Assembly may fix upon\r\nto evade the impending Stroke, I hope nothing will be done which may\r\nby the Invention of our Adversarys, be construed as even the\r\nAppearance of an Acquiescence in so grasping an Act of Tyranny.\r\n\r\nThus I have freely given my Sentiments upon the Question proposed;\r\nwhich I should not have venturd to do had it not been requested. I\r\nhave done it with the greatest Diffidence because I think I am fully\r\nsensible of my Inability to enter into a Question of so delicate a\r\nNature & great Importance especially as I have not had that\r\nopportunity to consult my friends which I promisd my self. I hope\r\nthe Assembly of Rhode Island will in their Conduct exhibit an Example\r\nof true Wisdom Fortitude & Perseverance. And with the greatest Respect\r\nto the Gentlemen to whose superior Understanding this and my former\r\nLetter to you is submitted, I\r\n\r\nremain\r\nSir\r\nYour assured friend\r\n& humble servant\r\n\r\nP.S. I beg just to propose for Consideration whether a circular Letr\r\nfrom your Assembly on this Occasion, to those of the other Colonies\r\nmight not tend to the Advantage of the General Cause & of R Island in\r\nparticular; I should think it would induce each of them, at least to\r\ninjoyn their Agents in Great Britain to represent the Severity of your\r\nCase in the strongest terms.\r\n\r\nTo the Hon Darius Sessions Esqr\r\nto be communicated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF MASSACHUSETTS TO\r\nTHE GOVERNOR. JANUARY 26, I773.1\r\n\r\n[Massachusetts State Papers, pp. 351-364; also printed in the Boston\r\nGazette, February 1, 1773, and in The Speeches of His Excellency\r\nGovernor Hutchinson (Boston, 1773), pp. 33-58.]\r\n\r\nMay it please your Excellency,\r\n\r\nYour Excellency's speech to the General Assembly, at the opening of\r\nthis session,2 has been read with great attention in this House.\r\n\r\nWe fully agree with your Excellency, that our own happiness, as well\r\nas his Majesty's service, very much depends upon peace and order; and\r\nwe shall at all times take such measures as are consistent with our\r\nconstitution, and the rights of the people, to promote and maintain\r\nthem.  That the government at present is in a very disturbed state, is\r\napparent. But we cannot ascribe it to the people's having adopted\r\nunconstitutional principles, which seems to be the cause assigned for\r\nit by your Excellency. It appears to us, to have been occasioned\r\nrather by the British House of Commons assuming and exercising a power\r\ninconsistent with the freedom of the constitution, to give and grant\r\nthe property of the colonists, and appropriate the same without their\r\nconsent.\r\n\r\nIt is needless for us to inquire what were the principles that induced\r\nthe councils of the nation to so new and unprecedented a measure. But,\r\nwhen the Parliament, by an act of their own, expressly declared, that\r\nthe King, Lords, and Commons, of the nation \"have, and of right ought\r\nto have full power and authority to make laws and statutes of\r\nsufficient force and validity, to bind the colonies and people of\r\nAmerica, subjects of the Crown of Great Britain, in all cases\r\nwhatever,\" and in consequence hereof, another revenue act was made,\r\nthe minds of the people were filled with anxiety, and they were justly\r\nalarmed with apprehensions of the total extinction of their liberties.\r\n\r\nThe result of the free inquiries of many persons, into the right of\r\nthe Parliament, to exercise such a power over the colonies, seems, in\r\nyour Excellency's opinion, to be the cause, of what you are pleased to\r\ncall the present \"disturbed state of the government;\" upon which, you\r\n\"may not any longer, consistent with your duty to the King, and your\r\nregard to the interest of the province, delay communicating your\r\nsentiments.\" But that the principles adopted in consequence hereof,\r\nare unconstitutional, is a subject of inquiry. We know of no such\r\ndisorders arising therefrom, as are mentioned by your Excellency. If\r\nGrand Jurors have not, on their oaths, found such offences, as\r\nyour Excellency, with the advice of his Majesty's Council, have\r\nordered to be prosecuted, it is to be presumed, they have followed the\r\ndictates of good conscience. They are the constitutional judges of\r\nthese matters, and it is not to be supposed, that moved from corrupt\r\nprinciples, they have suffered offenders to escape a prosecution, and\r\nthus supported and encouraged them to go on offending. If any part of\r\nauthority shall, in an unconstitutional manner, interpose in any\r\nmatter, it will be no wonder if it be brought into contempt; to\r\nthe lessening or confounding of that subordination, which is necessary\r\nto a well regulated state. Your Excellency's representation that the\r\nbands of government are weakened, we humbly conceive to be without\r\ngood grounds; though we must own, the heavy burdens unconstitutionally\r\nbrought upon the people, have been, and still are universally, and\r\nvery justly complained of, as a grievance.\r\n\r\nYou are pleased to say, that, \"when our predecessors first took\r\npossession of this plantation, or colony, under a grant and charter\r\nfrom the Crown of England, it was their sense, and it was the sense of\r\nthe kingdom, that they were to remain subject to the supreme authority\r\nof Parliament;\" whereby we understand your Excellency to mean, in the\r\nsense of the declaratory act of Parliament afore mentioned, in all\r\ncases whatever. And, indeed, it is difficult, if possible, to draw a\r\nline of distinction between the universal authority of Parliament over\r\nthe colonies, and no authority at all. It is, therefore, necessary for\r\nus to inquire how it appears, for your Excellency has not shown it to\r\nus, that when, or at the time that our predecessors took possession of\r\nthis plantation, or colony, under a grant and charter from the Crown\r\nof England, it was their sense, and the sense of the kingdom, that\r\nthey were to remain subject to the authority of Parliament. In making\r\nthis inquiry, we shall, according to your Excellency's recommendation,\r\ntreat the subject with calmness and candor, and also with a due regard\r\nto truth.\r\n\r\nPrevious to a direct consideration of the charter granted to the\r\nprovince or colony, and the better to elucidate the true sense and\r\nmeaning of it, we would take a view of the state of the English North\r\nAmerican continent at the time, when, and after possession was first\r\ntaken of any part of it, by the Europeans. It was then possessed by\r\nheathen and barbarous people, who had, nevertheless, all that right to\r\nthe soil, and sovereignty in and over the lands they possessed, which\r\nGod had originally given to man. Whether their being heathen, inferred\r\nany right or authority to christian princes, a right which had long\r\nbeen assumed by the Pope, to dispose of their lands to others, we will\r\nleave your Excellency, or any one of understanding and impartial\r\njudgment, to consider. It is certain, they had in no other sense,\r\nforfeited them to any power in Europe. Should the doctrine be\r\nadmitted, that the discovery of lands owned and possessed by pagan\r\npeople, gives to any christian prince a right and title to the\r\ndominion and property, still it is vested in the Crown alone. It was\r\nan acquisition of foreign territory, not annexed to the realm of\r\nEngland, and, therefore, at the absolute disposal of the Crown. For we\r\ntake it to be a settled point, that the King has a constitutional\r\nprerogative, to dispose of and alienate, any part of his territories\r\nnot annexed to the realm. In exercise of this prerogative, Queen\r\nElizabeth granted the first American charter; and, claiming a right by\r\nvirtue of discovery, then supposed to be valid, to the lands which are\r\nnow possessed by the colony of Virginia, she conveyed to Sir Walter\r\nRawleigh, the property, dominion, and sovereignty thereof, to be held\r\nof the Crown, by homage, and a certain render, without any reservation\r\nto herself, of any share in the Legislative and Executive authority.\r\nAfter the attainder of Sir Walter, King James the I. created two\r\nVirginian companies, to be governed each by laws, transmitted to them\r\nby his Majesty, and not by the Parliament, with power to establish,\r\nand cause to be made, a coin to pass current among them; and vested\r\nwith all liberties, franchises and immunities, within any of his other\r\ndominions, to all intents and purposes, as if they had been abiding\r\nand born within the realm. A declaration similar to this, is contained\r\nin the first charter of this colony, and in those of other American\r\ncolonies, which shows that the colonies were not intended, or\r\nconsidered to be within the realm of England, though within the\r\nallegiance of the English Crown. After this, another charter was\r\ngranted by the same King James, to the Treasurer and Company of\r\nVirginia, vesting them with full power and authority, to make, ordain,\r\nand establish, all manner of orders, laws, directions, instructions,\r\nforms and ceremonies of governments, and magistracy, fit and\r\nnecessary, and the same to abrogate, &c. without any reservation for\r\nsecuring their subjection to Parliament, and future laws of England. A\r\nthird charter was afterwards granted by the same King, to the\r\nTreasurer and Company of Virginia, vesting them with full power and\r\nauthority to make laws, with an addition of this clause, \"so,\r\nalways, that the same be not contrary to the laws and statutes of this\r\nour realm of England.\" The same clause was afterwards copied into the\r\ncharter of this and other colonies, with certain variations, such as,\r\nthat these laws should be \"consonant to reason,\" \"not repugnant to the\r\nlaws of England,\" \"as nearly as conveniently may be to the laws,\r\nstatutes and rights of England,\" &c. These modes of expression, convey\r\nthe same meaning, and serve to show an intention, that the laws of the\r\ncolonies should be as much as possible, conformable in the spirit of\r\nthem, to the principles and fundamental laws of the English\r\nconstitution, its rights and statutes then in being, and by no means\r\nto bind the colonies to a subjection to the supreme authority of the\r\nEnglish Parliament. And that this is the true intention, we think it\r\nfurther evident from this consideration, that no acts of any colony\r\nLegislative, are ever brought into Parliament for inspection there,\r\nthough the laws made in some of them, like the acts of the British\r\nParliament, are laid before the King for his dissent or allowance.\r\n\r\nWe have brought the first American charters into view, and the state\r\nof the country when they were granted, to show, that the right of\r\ndisposing of the lands was, in the opinion of those times, vested\r\nsolely in the Crown; that the several charters conveyed to the\r\ngrantees, who should settle upon the territories therein granted, all\r\nthe powers necessary to constitute them free and distinct states; and\r\nthat the fundamental laws of the English constitution should be the\r\ncertain and established rule of legislation, to which, the laws to\r\nbe made in the several colonies, were to be, as nearly as conveniently\r\nmight be, conformable, or similar, which was the true intent and\r\nimport of the words, \"not repugnant to the laws of England,\"\r\n\"consonant to reason,\" and other variant expressions in the different\r\ncharters. And we would add, that the King, in some of the charters,\r\nreserves the right to judge of the consonance and similarity of their\r\nlaws with the English constitution, to himself, and not to the\r\nParliament; and, in consequence thereof, to affirm, or within a\r\nlimited time, disallow them.\r\n\r\nThese charters, as well as that afterwards granted to Lord Baltimore,\r\nand other charters, are repugnant to the idea of Parliamentary\r\nauthority; and, to suppose a Parliamentary authority over the\r\ncolonies, under such charters, would necessarily induce that solecism\r\nin politics, imperium in imperio. And the King's repeatedly exercising\r\nthe prerogative of disposing of the American territory by such\r\ncharters, together with the silence of the nation thereupon, is an\r\nevidence that it was an acknowledged prerogative.\r\n\r\nBut, further to show the sense of the English Crown and nation, that\r\nthe American colonists, and our predecessors in particular, when they\r\nfirst took possession of this country, by a grant and charter from the\r\nCrown, did not remain subject to the supreme authority of Parliament,\r\nwe beg leave to observe, that when a bill was offered by the two\r\nHouses of Parliament to King Charles the I. granting to the subjects\r\nof England, the free liberty of fishing on the coast of America, he\r\nrefused his royal assent, declaring as a reason, that \"the colonies\r\nwere without the realm and jurisdiction of Parliament.\"\r\n\r\nIn like manner, his predecessor, James the I. had before declared,\r\nupon a similar occasion, that \"America was not annexed to the realm,\r\nand it was not fitting that Parliament should make laws for those\r\ncountries.\" This reason was, not secretly, but openly declared in\r\nParliament. If, then, the colonies were not annexed to the realm, at\r\nthe time when their charters were granted, they never could\r\nafterwards, without their own special consent, which has never since\r\nbeen had, or even asked. If they are not now annexed to the realm,\r\nthey are not a part of the kingdom, and consequently not subject to\r\nthe Legislative authority of the kingdom. For no country, by the\r\ncommon law, was subject to the laws or to the Parliament, but the\r\nrealm of England.\r\n\r\nWe would, if your Excellency pleases, subjoin an instance of conduct\r\nin King Charles the II. singular indeed, but important to our purpose,\r\nwho, in 1769, framed an act for a permanent revenue for the support of\r\nVirginia, and sent it there by Lord Culpepper, the Governor of that\r\ncolony, which was afterwards passed into a law, and \"enacted by the\r\nKing's most excellent Majesty, by, and with the consent of the General\r\nAssembly of Virginia.\" If the King had judged the colony to be a part\r\nof the realm, he would not, nor could he, consistently with Magna\r\nCharta, have placed himself at the head of, and joined with any\r\nLegislative body in making a law to tax the people there, other than\r\nthe Lords and Commons of England.\r\n\r\nHaving taken a view of the several charters of the first colony in\r\nAmerica, if we look into the old charter of this colony, we shall find\r\nit to be grounded on the same principle; that the right of disposing\r\nthe territory granted therein, was vested in the Crown, as being that\r\nChristian Sovereign who first discovered it, when in the possession of\r\nheathens; and that it was considered as being not within the realm,\r\nbut being only within the Fee and Seignory of the King. As, therefore,\r\nit was without the realm of England, must not the King, if he had\r\ndesigned that the Parliament should have any authority over it, have\r\nmade special reservation for that purpose, which was not done?\r\n\r\nYour Excellency says, \"it appears from the charter itself, to have\r\nbeen the sense of our predecessors, who first took possession of this\r\nplantation, or colony, that they were to remain subject to the\r\nauthority of Parliament.\" You have not been pleased to point out to\r\nus, how this appears from the charter, unless it be in the observation\r\nyou make on the above mentioned clause, viz.: \"that a favorable\r\nconstruction has been put upon this clause, when it has been allowed\r\nto intend such laws of England only, as are expressly made to respect\r\nus,\" which you say, \"is by charter, a reserve of power and authority\r\nto Parliament, to bind us by such laws, at least, as are made\r\nexpressly to refer to us, and consequently is a limitation of the\r\npower given to the General Court.\" But, we would still recur to the\r\ncharter itself, and ask your Excellency, how this appears, from\r\nthence, to have been the sense of our predecessors? Is any reservation\r\nof power and authority to Parliament thus to bind us, expressed or\r\nimplied in the charter? It is evident, that King Charles the I. the\r\nvery Prince who granted it, as well as his predecessor, had no such\r\nidea of the supreme authority of Parliament over the colony, from\r\ntheir declarations before recited. Your Excellency will then allow us,\r\nfurther to ask, by what authority, in reason or equity, the Parliament\r\ncan enforce a construction so unfavorable to us. Quod ab initio\r\ninjustum est, nullum potest habere juris efectum, said Grotius. Which,\r\nwith submission to your Excellency, may be rendered thus: whatever is\r\noriginally in its nature wrong, can never be sanctified, or made right\r\nby repetition and use.\r\n\r\nIn solemn agreements, subsequent restrictions ought never to be\r\nallowed. The celebrated author, whom your Excellency has quoted, tells\r\nus, that, \"neither the one or the other of the interested, or\r\ncontracting powers, hath a right to interpret at pleasure.\" This we\r\nmention, to show, even upon a supposition, that the Parliament had\r\nbeen a party to the contract, the invalidity of any of its subsequent\r\nacts, to explain any clause in the charter; more especially to\r\nrestrict or make void any clause granted therein to the General Court.\r\nAn agreement ought to be interpreted \"in such a manner as that it may\r\nhave its effect.\" But, if your Excellency's interpretation of this\r\nclause is just, \"that it is a reserve of power and authority to\r\nParliament to bind us by such laws as are made expressly to refer to\r\nus,\" it is not only \"a limitation of the power given to the General\r\nCourt\" to legislate, but it may, whenever the Parliament shall think\r\nfit, render it of no effect; for it puts it in the power of\r\nParliament, to bind us by as many laws as they please, and even to\r\nrestrain us from making any laws at all. If your Excellency's\r\nassertions in this, and the next succeeding part of your speech, were\r\nwell grounded, the conclusion would be undeniable, that the charter,\r\neven in this clause, \"does not confer or reserve any liberties,\" worth\r\nenjoying, \"but what would have been enjoyed without it;\" saving that,\r\nwithin any of his Majesty's dominions, we are to be considered\r\nbarely as not aliens. You are pleased to say, it cannot \"be contended,\r\nthat by the liberties of free and natural subjects,\" (which are\r\nexpressly granted in the charter, to all intents, purposes and\r\nconstructions, whatever,) \"is to be understood, an exemption from acts\r\nof Parliament, because not represented there; seeing it is provided by\r\nthe same charter, that such acts shall be in force.\" If, says an\r\neminent lawyer, \"the King grants to the town of D. the same liberties\r\nwhich London has, this shall be intended the like liberties.\" A grant\r\nof the liberties of free and natural subjects, is equivalent to a\r\ngrant of the same liberties. And the King, in the first charter to\r\nthis colony, expressly grants, that it \"shall be construed, reputed\r\nand adjudged in all cases, most favorably on the behalf and for the\r\nbenefit and behoof of the said Governor and Company, and their\r\nsuccessors - any matter, cause or thing, whatsover, to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding.\" It is one of the liberties of free and natural\r\nsubjects, born and abiding within the realm, to be governed, as your\r\nExcellency observes, \"by laws made by persons, in whose elections\r\nthey, from time to time, have a voice.\" This is an essential right.\r\nFor nothing is more evident, than, that any people, who are subject to\r\nthe unlimited power of another, must be in a state of abject slavery.\r\nIt was easily and plainly foreseen, that the right of representation\r\nin the English Parliament, could not be exercised by the people of\r\nthis colony. It would be impracticable, if consistent with the English\r\nconstitution. And for this reason, that this colony might have and\r\nenjoy all the liberties and immunities of free and natural subjects\r\nwithin the realm, as stipulated in the charter, it was necessary, and\r\na Legislative was accordingly constituted within the colony one branch\r\nof which, consists of Representatives chosen by the people, to make\r\nall laws, statutes, ordinances, &c. for the well ordering and\r\ngoverning the same, not repugnant to the laws of England, or, as\r\nnearly as conveniently might be, agreeable to the fundamental laws of\r\nthe English constitution. We are, therefore, still at a loss to\r\nconceive, where your Excellency finds it \" provided in the same\r\ncharter, that such acts,\" viz, acts of Parliament, made expressly to\r\nrefer to us, \" shall be in force \" in this province. There is nothing\r\nto this purpose, expressed in the charter, or in our opinion, even\r\nimplied in it. And surely it would be very absurd, that a charter,\r\nwhich is evidently formed upon a supposition and intention, that a\r\ncolony is and should be considered as not within the realm; and\r\ndeclared by the very Prince who granted it, to be not within the\r\njurisdiction of Parliament, should yet provide, that the laws which\r\nthe same Parliament should make, expressly to refer to that colony,\r\nshould be in force therein. Your Excellency is pleased to ask, \"does\r\nit follow, that the government, by their (our ancestors) removal from\r\none part of the dominion to another, loses its authority over that\r\npart to which they removed; and that they are freed from the\r\nsubjection they were under before?\" We answer, if that part of the\r\nKing's dominions, to which they removed, was not then a part of the\r\nrealm, and was never annexed to it, the Parliament lost no authority\r\nover it, having never had such authority; and the emigrations were\r\nconsequently freed from the subjection they were under before their\r\nremoval. The power and authority of Parliament, being constitutionally\r\nconfined within the limits of the realm, and the nation collectively,\r\nof which alone it is the representing and Legislative Assembly. Your\r\nExcellency further asks, \"will it not rather be said, that by this,\r\ntheir voluntary removal, they have relinquished, for a time, at least,\r\none of the rights of an English subject, which they might, if they\r\npleased, have continued to enjoy, and may again enjoy, whenever they\r\nreturn to the place where it can be exercised?\" To which we answer;\r\nthey never did relinquish the right to be governed by laws, made by\r\npersons in whose election they had a voice. The King stipulated with\r\nthem, that they should have and enjoy all the liberties of free and\r\nnatural subjects, born within the realm, to all intents, purposes and\r\nconstructions, whatsoever; that is, that they should be as free as\r\nthose, who were to abide within the realm: consequently, he stipulated\r\nwith them, that they should enjoy and exercise this most essential\r\nright, which discriminates freemen from vassals, uninterruptedly,\r\nin its full sense and meaning; and they did, and ought still to\r\nexercise it, without the necessity of returning, for the sake of\r\nexercising it, to the nation or state of England.\r\n\r\nWe cannot help observing, that your Excellency's manner of reasoning\r\non this point, seems to us, to render the most valuable clauses in our\r\ncharter unintelligible: as if persons going from the realm of England,\r\nto inhabit in America, should hold and exercise there a certain right\r\nof English subjects; but, in order to exercise it in such manner as to\r\nbe of any benefit to them, they must not inhabit there, but return to\r\nthe place where alone it can be exercised. By such construction, the\r\nwords of the charter can have no sense or meaning. We forbear\r\nremarking upon the absurdity of a grant to persons born without the\r\nrealm, of the same liberties which would have belonged to them, if\r\nthey had been born within the realm.\r\n\r\nYour Excellency is disposed to compare this government to the variety\r\nof corporations, formed within the kingdom, with power to make and\r\nexecute bylaws, &c.; and, because they remain subject to the supreme\r\nauthority of Parliament, to infer, that this colony is also subject to\r\nthe same authority: this reasoning appears to us not just. The members\r\nof those corporations are resident within the kingdom; and residence\r\nsubjects them to the authority of Parliament, in which they are also\r\nrepresented; whereas the people of this colony are not resident within\r\nthe realm. The charter was granted, with the express purpose to\r\ninduce them to reside without the realm; consequently, they are not\r\nrepresented in Parliament there. But, we would ask your Excellency,\r\nare any of the corporations, formed within the kingdom, vested with\r\nthe power of erecting other subordinate corporations? of enacting and\r\ndetermining what crimes shall be capital? and constituting courts of\r\ncommon law, with all their officers, for the hearing, trying and\r\npunishing capital offenders with death? These and many other powers\r\nvested in this government, plainly show, that it is to be considered\r\nas a corporation, in no other light, than as every state is a\r\ncorporation. Besides, appeals from the courts of law here, are not\r\nbrought before the House of Lords; which shows, that the peers of the\r\nrealm, are not the peers of America: but all such appeals are brought\r\nbefore the King in council, which is a further evidence, that we are\r\nnot within the realm.\r\n\r\nWe conceive enough has been said, to convince your Excellency, that,\r\n\"when our predecessors first took possession of this plantation, or\r\ncolony, by a grant and charter from the Crown of England, it was not,\r\nand never had been the sense of the kingdom, that they were to remain\r\nsubject to the supreme authority of Parliament. We will now, with your\r\nExcellency's leave, inquire what was the sense of our ancestors, of\r\nthis very important matter.\r\n\r\nAnd, as your Excellency has been pleased to tell us, you have not\r\ndiscovered, that the supreme authority of Parliament has been called\r\nin question, even by private and particular persons, until within\r\nseven or eight years past; except about the time of the anarchy and\r\nconfusion in England, which preceded the restoration of King Charles\r\nthe II. we beg leave to remind your Excellency of some parts of your\r\nown history of Massachusetts Bay. Therein we are informed of\r\nthe sentiments of \"persons of influence,\" after the restoration; from\r\nwhich, the historian tells us, some parts of their conduct, that is,\r\nof the General Assembly, \"may be pretty well accounted for.\" By the\r\nhistory, it appears to have been the opinion of those persons of\r\ninfluence, \"that the subjects of any prince or state, had a natural\r\nright to remove to any other state, or to another quarter of the\r\nworld, unless the state was weakened or exposed by such remove;\r\nand, even in that case, if they were deprived of the right of all\r\nmankind, liberty of conscience, it would justify a separation, and\r\nupon their removal, their subjection determined and ceased.\" That \"the\r\ncountry to which they had removed, was claimed and possessed by\r\nindependent princes, whose right to the lordship and sovereignty\r\nthereof had been acknowledged by the Kings of England,\" an instance of\r\nwhich is quoted in the margin. \"That they themselves had actually\r\npurchased, for valuable consideration, not only the soil, but the\r\ndominion, the lordship and sovereignty of those princes;\" without\r\nwhich purchase, \"in the sight of God and men, they had no right or\r\ntitle to what they possessed.\" They had received a charter of\r\nincorporation from the King, from whence arose a new kind of\r\nsubjection, namely, \"a voluntary, civil subjection;\" and by this\r\ncompact, \"they were to be governed by laws made by themselves.\" Thus\r\nit appears to have been the sentiments of private persons, though\r\npersons by whose sentiments the public conduct was influenced, that\r\ntheir removal was a justifiable separation from the mother state, upon\r\nwhich, their subjection to that state, determined and ceased. The\r\nsupreme authority of Parliament, if it had then ever been asserted,\r\nmust surely have been called in question, by men who had advanced such\r\nprinciples as these.\r\n\r\nThe first act of Parliament, made expressly to refer to the colonies,\r\nwas after the restoration. In the reign of King Charles the II.\r\nseveral such acts passed. And the same history informs us, there was a\r\ndifficulty in conforming to them; and the reason of this difficulty is\r\nexplained in a letter of the General Assembly to their Agent, quoted\r\nin the following words; \"they apprehended them to be an invasion of\r\nthe rights, liberties and properties of the subjects of his Majesty,\r\nin the colony, they not being represented in Parliament, and according\r\nto the usual sayings of the learned in the law, the laws of England\r\nwere bounded within the four seas, and did not reach America: However,\r\nas his Majesty had signified his pleasure, that those acts should be\r\nobserved in the Massachusetts, they had made provision, by a law of\r\nthe colony, that they should be strictly attended.\"3 Which provision,\r\nby a law of their own, would have been superfluous, if they had\r\nadmitted the supreme authority of Parliament. In short, by the same\r\nhistory it appears, that those acts of Parliament, as such, were\r\ndisregarded; and the following reason is given for it: \"It seems to\r\nhave been a general opinion, that acts of Parliament have no other\r\nforce, than what they derived from acts made by the General Court, to\r\nestablish and confirm them.\"\r\n\r\nBut, still further to show the sense of our ancestors, respecting this\r\nmatter, we beg leave to recite some parts of a narrative, presented to\r\nthe Lords of Privy Council, by Edward Randolph, in the year 1676,\r\nwhich we find in your Excellency's collection of papers lately\r\npublished.4 Therein5 it is declared to be the sense of the colony,\r\n\"that no law is in force or esteem there, but such as are made by the\r\nGeneral Court; and, therefore, it is accounted a breach of their\r\nprivilegčs, and a betraying of the liberties of their commonwealth, to\r\nurge the observation of the laws of England.\" And, further, \"that no\r\noath shall be urged, or required to be taken by any person, but such\r\noath as the General Court hath considered, allowed and required.\" And,\r\nfurther, \"there is no notice taken of the act of navigation,\r\nplantation or any other laws, made in England for the regulation of\r\ntrade.\" \"That the government would make the world believe, They are a\r\nfree state, and do act in all matters accordingly.\" Again, \"these\r\nmagistrates ever reserve to themselves, a power to alter, evade and\r\ndisannul any law or command, not agreeing with their humor, or the\r\nabsolute authority of their government, acknowledging no superior.\"\r\nAnd, further, \"he (the Governor) freely declared to me, that the laws\r\nmade by your Majesty and your Parliament, obligeth them in nothing,\r\nbut what consists with the interests of that colony; that the\r\nLegislative power and authority is, and abides in them solely.\" And in\r\nthe same Mr. Randolph's letter to the Bishop of London, July 14.,\r\n1682, he says, \"this independency in government is claimed and daily\r\npractised.\"6 And your Excellency being then sensible, that this was\r\nthe sense of our ancestors, in a marginal note, in the same collection\r\nof papers, observes, that, \"this, viz, the provision made for\r\nobserving the acts of trade, is very extraordinary, for this provision\r\nwas an act of the colony, declaring the acts of trade shall be in\r\nforce there.\" Although Mr. Randolph was very unfriendly to the colony,\r\nyet, as his declarations are concurrent with those recited from your\r\nExcellency's history, we think they may be admitted, for the purpose\r\nfor which they are now brought.\r\n\r\nThus we see, from your Excellency's history and publications, the\r\nsense our ancestors had of the jurisdiction of Parliament, under the\r\nfirst charter. Very different from that, which your Excellency in your\r\nspeech, apprehends it to have been.\r\n\r\nIt appears by Mr. Neal's History of New England, that the agents, who\r\nhad been employed by the colony to transact its affairs in England, at\r\nthe time when the present charter was granted, among other reasons,\r\ngave the following for their acceptance of it, viz. \"The General Court\r\nhas, with the King's approbation, as much power in New England, as the\r\nKing and Parliament have in England; they have all English privileges,\r\nand can be touched by no law, and by no tax but of their own making.\"7\r\nThis is the earliest testimony that can be given of the sense our\r\npredecessors had of the supreme authority of Parliament, under the\r\npresent charter. And it plainly shows, that they, who having been\r\nfreely conversant with those who framed the charter, must have well\r\nunderstood the design and meaning of it, supposed that the terms in\r\nour charter, \"full power and authority,\" intended and were considered\r\nas a sole and exclusive power, and that there was no \"reserve in the\r\ncharter, to the authority of Parliament, to bind the colony\" by any\r\nacts whatever.\r\n\r\nSoon after the arrival of the charter, viz, in 1692, your Excellency's\r\nhistory informs us,8 \"the first act\" of this Legislative, was a sort\r\nof Magna Charta, asserting and setting forth their general privileges,\r\nand this clause was among the rest; \"no aid, tax, tallage, assessment,\r\ncustom, loan, benevolence, or imposition whatever, shall be laid,\r\nassessed, imposed, or levied on any of their Majesty's subjects, or\r\ntheir estates, on any pretence whatever, but by the act and consent of\r\nthe Governor, Council, and Representatives of the people assembled in\r\nGeneral Court.\" And though this act was disallowed, it serves to show\r\nthe sense which the General Assembly, contemporary with the granting\r\nthe charter, had of their sole and exclusive right to legislate for\r\nthe colony. The history says, \"the other parts of the act were copied\r\nfrom Magna Charta;\" by which, we may conclude that the Assembly then\r\nconstrued the words, \"not repugnant to the laws,\" to mean, conformable\r\nto the fundamental principles of the English constitution. And it is\r\nobservable, that the Lords of Privy Council, so lately as in the reign\r\nof Queen Anne, when several laws enacted by the General Assembly were\r\nlaid before her Majesty for her allowance, interpreted the words in\r\nthis charter, \"not repugnant to the laws of England,\" by the words,\r\n\"as nearly as conveniently may be agreeable to the laws and statutes\r\nof England.\" And her Majesty was pleased to disallow those acts, not\r\nbecause they were repugnant to any law or statute of England, made\r\nexpressly to refer to the colony, but because divers persons, by\r\nvirtue thereof, were punished, without being tried by their peers in\r\nthe ordinary \"courts of law,\" and \"by the ordinary rules and known\r\nmethods of justice,\" contrary to the express terms of Magna Charta,\r\nwhich was a statute in force at the time of granting the charter, and\r\ndeclaratory of the rights and liberties of the subjects within the\r\nrealm.\r\n\r\nYou are pleased to say, that \"our provincial or local laws have, in\r\nnumerous instances, had relation to acts of Parliament, made to\r\nrespect the plantations, and this colony in particular.\" The authority\r\nof the Legislature, says the same author who is quoted by your\r\nExcellency, \"does not extend so far as the fundamentals of the\r\nconstitution. They ought to consider the fundamental laws as sacred,\r\nif the nation has not in very express terms, given them the power to\r\nchange them. For the constitution of the state ought to be fixed;\r\nand since that was first established by the nation, which afterwards\r\ntrusted certain persons with the Legislative power, the fundamental\r\nlaws are excepted from their commission.\" Now the fundamentals of the\r\nconstitution of this province, are stipulated in the charter; the\r\nreasoning, therefore, in this case, holds equally good. Much less,\r\nthen, ought any acts or doings of the General Assembly, however\r\nnumerous, to neither of which your Excellency has pointed us,\r\nwhich barely relate to acts of Parliament made to respect the\r\nplantations in general, or this colony in particular, to be taken\r\nas an acknowledgment of this people, or even of the Assembly,\r\nwhich inadvertently passed those acts, that we are subject to the\r\nsupreme authority of Parliament; and with still less reason are\r\nthe decisions in the executive courts to determine this point. If\r\nthey have adopted that \"as part of the rule of law,\" which, in\r\nfact, is not, it must be imputed to inattention or error in\r\njudgment, and cannot justly be urged as an alteration or\r\nrestriction of the Legislative authority of the province.\r\n\r\nBefore we leave this part of your Excellency's speech, we would\r\nobserve, that the great design of our ancestors in leaving the\r\nkingdom of England, was to be freed from a subjection to its\r\nspiritual laws and courts, and to worship God according to the\r\ndictates of their consciences. Your Excellency, in your history\r\nobserves, that their design was \"to obtain for themselves and\r\ntheir posterity, the liberty of worshipping God in such manner as\r\nappeared to them most agreeable to the sacred scriptures.\" And the\r\nGeneral Court themselves declared in 1651, that \"seeing just cause\r\nto fear the persecution of the then Bishop, and high commission\r\nfor not conforming to the ceremonies of those under their power,\r\nthey thought it their safest course, to get to this outside of the\r\nworld, out of their view and beyond their reach.\" But, if it had\r\nbeen their sense, that they were still to be subject to the\r\nsupreme authority of Parliament, they must have known that their\r\ndesign might, and probably would be frustrated; that the\r\nParliament, especially considering the temper of those times,\r\nmight make what ecclesiastical laws they pleased, expressly to\r\nrefer to them, and place them in the same circumstances with\r\nrespect to religious matters, to be relieved from which, was the\r\ndesign of their removal; and we would add, that if your\r\nExcellency's construction of the clause in our present charter is\r\njust, another clause therein, which provides for liberty of\r\nconscience for all christians, except papists, may be rendered\r\nvoid by an act of Parliament made to refer to us, requiring a\r\nconformity to the rights and mode of worship in the church of\r\nEngland, or any other.\r\n\r\nThus we have endeavored to show the sense of the people of this\r\ncolony under both charters; and, if there have been in any late\r\ninstances a submission to acts of Parliament, it has been, in our\r\nopinion, rather from inconsideration, or a reluctance at the idea\r\nof contending with the parent state, than from a conviction or\r\nacknowledgment of the Supreme Legislative authority of Parliament.\r\n\r\nYour Excellency tells us, \"you know of no line that can be drawn\r\nbetween the supreme authority of Parliament and the total\r\nindependence of the colonies.\" If there be no such line, the\r\nconsequence is, either that the colonies are the vassals of the\r\nParliament, or that they are totally independent. As it cannot be\r\nsupposed to have been the intention of the parties in the compact,\r\nthat we should be reduced to a state of vassalage, the conclusion\r\nis, that it was their sense that we were thus independent. \"It is\r\nimpossible,\" your Excellency says, \"that there should be two\r\nindependent Legislatures in one and the same state.\" May we not\r\nthen further conclude, that it was their sense, that the colonies\r\nwere, by their charters, made distinct states from the mother\r\ncountry? Your Excellency adds, \"for although there may be but one\r\nhead, the King, yet the two Legislative bodies will make two\r\ngovernments as distinct as the kingdoms of England and Scotland,\r\nbefore the union.\" Very true, may it please your Excellency; and\r\nif they interfere not with each other, what hinders, but that\r\nbeing united in one head and common Sovereign, they may live\r\nhappily in that connection, and mutually support and protect each\r\nother? Notwithstanding all the terrors which your Excellency has\r\npictured to us as the effects of a total independence, there is\r\nmore reason to dread the consequences of absolute uncontroled\r\npower, whether of a nation or a monarch, than those of a total\r\nindependence. It would be a misfortune \"to know by experience, the\r\ndifference between the liberties of an English colonist and those\r\nof the Spanish, French, and Dutch\": and since the British\r\nParliament has passed an act, which is executed even with rigor,\r\nthough not voluntarily submitted to, for raising a revenue, and\r\nappropriating the same, without the consent of the people who pay\r\nit, and have claimed a power of making such laws as they please,\r\nto order and govern us, your Excellency will excuse us in asking,\r\nwhether you do not think we already experience too much of such a\r\ndifference, and have not reason to fear we shall soon be reduced\r\nto a worse situation than that of the colonies of France, Spain,\r\nor Holland?\r\n\r\nIf your Excellency expects to have the line of distinction between\r\nthe supreme authority of Parliament, and the total independence of\r\nthe colonies drawn by us, we would say it would be an arduous\r\nundertaking, and of very great importance to all the other\r\ncolonies; and therefore, could we conceive of such a line, we\r\nshould be unwilling to propose it, without their consent in\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, these are great and profound questions. It is the\r\ngrief of this House, that, by the ill policy of a late injudicious\r\nadministration, America has been driven into the contemplation of\r\nthem. And we cannot but express our concern, that your Excellency,\r\nby your speech, has reduced us to the unhappy alternative, either\r\nof appearing by our silence to acquiesce in your Excellency's\r\nsentiments, or of thus freely discussing this point.\r\n\r\nAfter all that we have said, we would be far from being understood\r\nto have in the least abated that just sense of allegiance which we\r\nowe to the King of Great Britain, our rightful Sovereign; and should\r\nthe people of this province be left to the free and full exercise of\r\nall the liberties and immunities granted to them by charter, there\r\nwould be no danger of an independence on the Crown. Our charters\r\nreserve great power to the Crown in its Representative, fully\r\nsufficient to balance, analogous to the English constitution, all the\r\nliberties and privileges granted to the people. All this your\r\nExcellency knows full well; and whoever considers the power and\r\ninfluence, in all their branches, reserved by our charter, to the\r\nCrown, will be far from thinking that the Commons of this province are\r\ntoo independent.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Adams was a member of the committee appointed by the House on\r\nJanuary 8 to prepare this answer, and also a member of the committee\r\nappointed January 26 to present the answer to the Governor.\r\nConcerning the authorship of the answer, see W.

I hope your Governor\r\nwill not think it proper for him to act in the Commission if the\r\nothers should determine so to do. Will it not be construed as\r\nconceding on his part to the Legality of it? Every Movement on the\r\nSide of the Commissioners & the Assembly must be important. I trust no\r\nConcessions will be made on your part which shall have the remotest\r\ntendency to fix a precedent; for if it is once establishd, a thousand\r\nCommissions of the like arbitrary kind may be introducd to the utter\r\nruin of your free Constitution. The promoters of ministerial measures\r\nin this Town are pleasd to hear from one of the Commissioners that\r\nthey are treated with great respect: Even common Civility will be thus\r\ncolourd to serve the great purpose. Will it not be necessary at all\r\nEvents for the Assembly to enter a protest on their Journal against so\r\nunconstitutional a proceeding. This is the Sentiment of a Gentleman\r\nhere whose Judgment I very much regard. Such has been the constant\r\npractice of the Assembly of this province in like Cases, for some\r\nyears past. You will see by our Governors Speech what Use is made of\r\nMistakes of this Sort; they are even Improved as Arguments of our\r\nhaving voluntarily consented to be the Vassals of the British\r\nParliament. Indeed the Doctrine he has advancd strikes at the root of\r\nevery civil Constitution in America. If it be admissible, you have no\r\njust Cause to complain of the present Measure for it is founded upon\r\nthe Authority of that parliament, to the Jurisdiction of which\r\nnotwithstanding your Charter, you remain subject.\r\n\r\nI shall receive a Letter from you by the return of the post if\r\nyour Attention to the publick Affairs will admit of it, as a great\r\nfavor. In the mean time I beg you to excuse this hasty Scrawl &\r\nbelieve me to be &c\r\n\r\n\r\n1 See above, page 389. note.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\nTO THE GOVERNOR. FEBRUARY 12, 1773.1\r\n\r\n[Massachusetts State Papers, pp. 366, 367; printed also in the\r\nGentleman's Magazine, vol. xliii., Pp. 198, 199.]\r\n\r\nMay it please your Excellency,\r\n\r\nYour message of the 4th instant,2 informs this House, that his\r\nMajesty has been pleased to order that salaries shall be allowed\r\nto the Justices of the Superior Court of this province.\r\n\r\nWe conceive that no Judge, who has a due regard to justice, or\r\neven to his own character, would choose to be placed under such an\r\nundue bias as they must be under, in the opinion of this House, by\r\naccepting of, and becoming dependent for their salaries upon the\r\nCrown.\r\n\r\nHad not his Majesty been misinformed, with respect to the\r\nconstitution and appointment of our Judges, by those who advised\r\nto this measure, we are persuaded, he would never have passed such\r\nan order; as he was pleased to declare, upon his accession to the\r\nthrone, that \"he looked upon the independence and uprightness of\r\nthe Judges, as essential to the impartial administration of\r\njustice, as one of the best securities of the rights and liberties\r\nof his subjects, and as most conducive to the honor of the Crown.\"\r\n\r\nYour Excellency's precaution to prevent all claim from the\r\nprovince for any services, for which the Justices may also be\r\nentitled to a salary from the King, is comparatively, of very\r\nsmall consideration with us.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the many attempts that have been made,\r\neffectually to render null and void those clauses in our charter,\r\nupon which the freedom of our constitution depends, we should be\r\nlost to all public feeling, should we not manifest a just\r\nresentment. We are more and more convinced, that it has been the\r\ndesign of administration, totally to subvert the constitution, and\r\nintroduce an arbitrary government into this province; and we\r\ncannot wonder that the apprehensions of this people are thoroughly\r\nawakened.\r\n\r\nWe wait with impatience to know, and hope your Excellency will\r\nvery soon be able to assure us, that the Justices will utterly\r\nrefuse ever to accept of support, in a manner so justly obnoxious\r\nto the disinterested and judicious part of the good people of this\r\nprovince, being repugnant to the charter, and utterly inconsistent\r\nwith the safety of the rights, liberties and properties of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Stated to have been written by Adams, in W.

MARCH 2, 1773.1\r\n\r\n[Massachusetts State Papers, pp. 384-396; printed also in the\r\nBoston Gazette, March 8, 1773, and in The Speeches of His\r\nExcellency Governor Hutchinson, pp. 90-113.]\r\n\r\nMay it please your Excellency,\r\n\r\nIn your speech, at the Opening of the present session2, your\r\nExcellency expressed your displeasure, at some late proceedings of\r\nthe town of Boston, and other principal towns in the province. And,\r\nin another speech3 to both Houses, we have your repeated exceptions\r\nat the same proceedings, as being \"unwarrantable,\" and of a dangerous\r\nnature and tendency; \"against which, you thought yourself bound to\r\ncall upon us to join with you in bearing a proper testimony.\" This\r\nHouse have not discovered any principles advanced by the town of\r\nBoston, that are unwarrantable by the constitution; nor does it appear\r\nto us, that they have \"invited every other town and district in the\r\nprovince, to adopt their principles.\" We are fully convinced, that it\r\nis our duty to bear our testimony against \"innovations, of a dangerous\r\nnature and tendency;\" but, it is clearly our opinion, that it is the\r\nindisputable right of all, or any of his Majesty's subjects, in\r\nthis province, regularly and orderly to meet together, to state\r\nthe grievances they labor under; and, to propose, and unite in\r\nsuch constitutional measures, as they shall judge necessary or proper,\r\nto obtain redress. This right has been frequently exercised by his\r\nMajesty's subjects within the realm; and, we do not recollect an\r\ninstance, since the happy revolution, when the two Houses of\r\nParliament have been called upon to discountenance, or bear their\r\ntestimony against it, in a speech from the throne.\r\n\r\nYour Excellency is pleased to take notice of some things, which we\r\n\"allege,\" in our answer to your first speech; and, the observation\r\nyou make, we must confess, is as natural, and undeniably true, as\r\nany one that could have been made; that, \"if our foundation shall\r\nfail us in every part of it, the fabric we have raised upon it,\r\nmust certainly fall.\" You think this foundation will fail us; but,\r\nwe wish your Excellency had condescended to a consideration of\r\nwhat we have \"adduced in support of our principles.\" We might\r\nthen, perhaps, have had some things offered for our conviction,\r\nmore than bare affirmations; which, we must beg to be excused, if\r\nwe say, are far from being sufficient, though they came with your\r\nExcellency's authority, for which, however, we have a due regard.\r\n\r\nYour Excellency says, that, \"as English subjects, and agreeable to\r\nthe doctrine of the feudal tenure, all our lands are held mediately,\r\nor immediately, of the Crown.\" We trust, your Excellency does not mean\r\nto introduce the feudal system in its perfection; which, to use the\r\nwords of one of our greatest historians, was \"a state of perpetual\r\nwar, anarchy, and confusion, calculated solely for defence against the\r\nassaults of any foreign power; but, in its provision for the interior\r\norder and tranquillity of society, extremely defective. A\r\nconstitution, so contradictory to all the principles that govern\r\nmankind, could never be brought about, but by foreign conquest or\r\nnative usurpation.\" And, a very celebrated writer calls it, \"that most\r\niniquitous and absurd form of government, by which human nature\r\nwas so shamefully degraded.\" This system of iniquity, by a strange\r\nkind of fatality, \"though originally formed for an encampment, and\r\nfor military purposes only, spread over a great part of Europe;\"\r\nand, to serve the purposes of oppression and tyranny, \"was adopted\r\nby princes, and wrought into their civil constitutions;\" and,\r\naided by the canon law, calculated by the Roman Pontiff, to exalt\r\nhimself above all that is called God, it prevailed to the almost\r\nutter extinction of knowledge, virtue, religion, and liberty from\r\nthat part of the earth. But, from the time of the reformation, in\r\nproportion as knowledge, which then darted its rays upon the\r\nbenighted world, increased, and spread among the people, they grew\r\nimpatient under this heavy yoke; and the most virtuous and\r\nsensible among them, to whose steadfastness, we, in this distant\r\nage and climate, are greatly indebted, were determined to get rid\r\nof it; and, though they have in a great measure subdued its power\r\nand influence in England, they have never yet totally eradicated\r\nits principles.\r\n\r\nUpon these principles, the King claimed an absolute right to, and\r\na perfect estate in, all the lands within his dominions; but, how\r\nhe came by this absolute right and perfect estate, is a mystery which\r\nwe have never seen unravelled, nor is it our business or design, at\r\npresent, to inquire. He granted parts or parcels of it to his\r\nfriends, the great men, and they granted lesser parcels to their\r\ntenants. All, therefore, derived their right and held their lands,\r\nupon these principles, mediately or immediately of the King; which\r\nMr. Blackstone, however, calls, \"in reality, a mere fiction of our\r\nEnglish tenures.\"\r\n\r\nBy what right, in nature and reason, the christian princes in\r\nEurope, claimed the lands of heathen people, upon a discovery made\r\nby any of their subjects, is equally mysterious. Such, however,\r\nwas the doctrine universally prevailing, when the lands in America\r\nwere discovered; but, as the people of England, upon those\r\nprinciples, held all the lands they possessed, by grants from the\r\nKing, and the King had never granted the lands in America to them,\r\nit is certain they could have no sort of claim to them. Upon the\r\nprinciples advanced, the lordship and dominion, like that of the\r\nlands in England, was in the King solely; and a right from thence\r\naccrued to him, of disposing such territories, under such tenure,\r\nand for such services to be performed, as the King or Lord thought\r\nproper. But how the grantees became subjects of England, that is,\r\nthe supreme authority of the Parliament, your Excellency has not\r\nexplained to us. We conceive that upon the feudal principles, all\r\npower is in the King; they afford us no idea of Parliament. \"The\r\nLord was in early times, the Legislator and Judge over all his\r\nfeudatories,\" says Judge Blackstone. By the struggle for liberty\r\nin England, from the days of King John, to the last happy\r\nrevolution, the constitution has been gradually changing for the\r\nbetter; and upon the more rational principles, that all men, by\r\nnature, are in a state of equality in respect of jurisdiction and\r\ndominion, power in England has been more equally divided. And\r\nthus, also in America, though we hold our lands agreeably to the\r\nfeudal principles of the King; yet our predecessors wisely took\r\ncare to enter into compact with the King, that power here should\r\nalso be equally divided, agreeable to the original fundamental\r\nprinciples of the English constitution, declared in Magna Charta,\r\nand other laws and statutes of England, made to confirm them.\r\n\r\nYour Excellency says, \"you can by no means concede to us that it\r\nis now, or was, when the plantations were first granted, the\r\nprerogative of the Kings of England, to constitute a number of new\r\ngovernments, altogether independent of the sovereign authority of\r\nthe English empire.\" By the feudal principles, upon which you say\r\n\"all the grants which have been made of America, are founded, the\r\nconstitutions of the Emperor, have the force of law.\" If our\r\ngovernment be considered as merely feudatory, we are subject to\r\nthe King's absolute will, and there is no authority of Parliament,\r\nas the sovereign authority of the British empire. Upon these\r\nprinciples, what could hinder the King's constituting a number of\r\nindependent governments in America? That King Charles the I. did\r\nactually set up a government in this colony, conceding to it\r\npowers of making and executing laws, without any reservation to\r\nthe English Parliament, of authority to make future laws binding\r\ntherein, is a fact which your Excellency has not disproved, if you\r\nhave denied it. Nor have you shewn that the Parliament or nation\r\nobjected to it; from whence we have inferred that it was an\r\nacknowledged right. And we cannot conceive, why the King has not the\r\nsame right to alienate and dispose of countries acquired by the\r\ndiscovery of his subjects, as he has to \"restore, upon a treaty of\r\npeace, countries which have been acquired in war,\" carried on at the\r\ncharge of the nation; or to \"sell and deliver up any part of his\r\ndominions to a foreign Prince or state, against the general sense of\r\nthe nation;\" which is \"an act of power,\" or prerogative, which your\r\nExcellency allows. You tell us, that, \"when any new countries are\r\ndiscovered by English subjects, according to the general law and usage\r\nof nations, they become part of the state. The law of nations is, or\r\nought to be, founded on the law of reason. It was the saying of\r\nSir Edwin Sandis, in the great case of the union of the realm of\r\nScotland with England, which is applicable to our present purpose,\r\nthat \"there being no precedent for this case in the law, the law\r\nis deficient; and the law being deficient, recourse is to be had\r\nto custom; and custom being insufficient, we must recur to natural\r\nreason;\" the greatest of all authorities, which, he adds, \"is the\r\nlaw of nations.\" The opinions, therefore, and determinations of\r\nthe greatest Sages and Judges of the law in the Exchequer Chamber,\r\nought not to be considered as decisive or binding, in our present\r\ncontroversy with your Excellency, any further, than they are\r\nconsonant to natural reason. If, however, we were to recur to such\r\nopinions and determinations, we should find very great authorities\r\nin our favor, to show, that the statutes of England are not binding on\r\nthose who are not represented in Parliament there. The opinion of Lord\r\nCoke, that Ireland was bound by statutes of England, wherein they were\r\nnamed, if compared with his other writings, appears manifestly to be\r\ngrounded upon a supposition, that Ireland had, by an act of their own,\r\nin the reign of King John, consented to be thus bound; and, upon any\r\nother supposition, this opinion would be against reason; for consent\r\nonly gives human laws their force. We beg leave, upon what your\r\nExcellency has observed of the colony becoming a part of the state, to\r\nsubjoin the opinions of several learned civilians, as quoted by a very\r\nable lawyer in this country. \"Colonies,\" says Puffendorf, \"are\r\nsettled in different methods; for, either the colony continues a\r\npart of the Commonwealth it was set out from, or else is obliged\r\nto pay a dutiful regard to the mother Commonwealth, and to be in\r\nreadiness to defend and vindicate its honor, and so is united by a\r\nsort of unequal confederacy; or, lastly, is erected into a\r\nseparate Commonwealth and assumes the same rights, with the state\r\nit descended from.\" And, King Tullius, as quoted by the same\r\nlearned author, from Grotius, says, \"we look upon it to be neither\r\ntruth nor justice, that mother cities, ought, of necessity, and by\r\nthe law of nature, to rule over the colonies.\"\r\n\r\nYour Excellency has misinterpreted what we have said, \"that no\r\ncountry, by the common law, was subject to the laws or the\r\nParliament, but the realm of England;\" and, are pleased to tell\r\nus, \"that we have expressed ourselves incautiously.\"4 We beg leave\r\nto recite the words of the Judges of England, in the before\r\nmentioned case, to our purpose. \"If a King go out of England with\r\na company of his servants, allegiance remaineth among his subjects\r\nand servants, although he be out of his realm, whereto his laws\r\nare confined.\" We did not mean to say, as your Excellency would\r\nsuppose, that \"the common law prescribes limits to the extent of\r\nthe Legislative power,\" though, we shall always affirm it to be\r\ntrue, of the law of reason and natural equity. Your Excellency\r\nthinks, you have made it appear, that the \"colony of Massachusetts\r\nBay is holden as feudatory of the imperial Crown of England;\" and,\r\ntherefore, you say, \"to use the words of a very great authority in\r\na case, in some respects analogous to it,\" being feudatory, it\r\nnecessarily follows, that \"it is under the government of the\r\nKing's laws.\" Your Excellency has not named this authority; but,\r\nwe conceive his meaning must be, that being feudatory, it is under\r\nthe government of the King's laws absolutely; for, as we have\r\nbefore said, the feudal system admits of no idea of the authority\r\nof Parliament; and this would have been the case of the colony,\r\nbut for the compact with the King in the charter.\r\n\r\nYour Excellency says, that \"persons thus holding under the Crown\r\nof England, remain, or become subjects of England,\" by which, we\r\nsuppose your Excellency to mean, subject to the supreme authority\r\nof Parliament, \"to all intents and purposes, as fully, as if any of\r\nthe royal manors, &c. within the realm, had been granted to them upon\r\nthe like tenure.\" We apprehend, with submission, your Excellency is\r\nmistaken in supposing that our allegiance is due to the Crown of\r\nEngland. Every man swears allegiance for himself, to his own King, in\r\nhis natural person. Every subject is presumed by law to be sworn to\r\nthe King, which is to his natural person,\" says Lord Coke. Rep. on\r\nCalvin's case.5 \"The allegiance is due to his natural body;\" and,\r\nhe says, \"in the reign of Edward II. the Spencers, the father and\r\nthe son, to cover the treason hatched in their hearts, invented\r\nthis damnable and damned opinion, that homage and oath of allegiance\r\nwas more by reason of the King's Crown, that is, of his politic\r\ncapacity, than by reason of the person of the King; upon which\r\nopinion, they inferred execrable and detestable consequents.\" The\r\nJudges of England, all but one, in the case of the union between\r\nScotland and England, declared, that \"allegiance followeth the natural\r\nperson, not the politic;\" and, \"to prove the allegiance to be tied to\r\nthe body natural of the King, and not to the body politic, the Lord\r\nCoke cited the phrases of divers statutes, mentioning our natural\r\nliege Sovereign.\" If, then, the homage and allegiance is not to the\r\nbody politic of the King, then it is not to him as the head, or any\r\npart of that Legislative authority, which your Excellency says, \"is\r\nequally extensive with the authority of the Crown throughout every\r\npart of the dominion;\" and your Excellency's observations thereupon,\r\nmust fail. The same Judges mention the allegiance of a subject to the\r\nKings of England, who is out of the reach and extent of the laws of\r\nEngland, which is perfectly reconcileable with the principles of\r\nour ancestors, quoted before from your Excellency's history, but,\r\nupon your Excellency's principles, appears to us to be an\r\nabsurdity. The Judges, speaking of a subject, say, \"although his\r\nbirth was out of the bounds of the kingdom of England, and out of\r\nthe reach and extent of the laws of England, yet, if it were\r\nwithin the allegiance of the King of England, &c. Normandy,\r\nAquitain, Gascoign, and other places, within the limits of France,\r\nand, consequently, out of the realm or bounds of the kingdom of\r\nEngland, were in subjection to the Kings of England.\" And the\r\nJudges say, \"Rex et Regnum, be not so relatives, as a King can be\r\nKing but of one kingdom, which clearly holdeth not, but that his\r\nkingly power extending to divers nations and kingdoms, all owe him\r\nequal subjection, and are equally born to the benefit of his\r\nprotection; and, although he is to govern them by their distinct\r\nlaws, yet any one of the people coming into the other, is to have\r\nthe benefit of the laws, wheresoever he cometh.\" So they are not\r\nto be deemed aliens, as your Excellency in your speech supposes,\r\nin any of the dominions, all which accords with the principles our\r\nancestors held. \"And he is to bear the burden of taxes of the\r\nplace where he cometh, but living in one, or for his livelihood in\r\none, he is not to be taxed in the other, because laws ordain taxes,\r\nimpositions, and charges, as a discipline of subjection,\r\nparticularized to every particular nation.\" Nothing, we think, can\r\nbe more clear to our purpose than this decision of Judges, perhaps\r\nas learned, as ever adorned the English nation, or in favor of\r\nAmerica, in her present controversy with the mother state.\r\n\r\nYour Excellency says, that, by \"our not distinguishing between the\r\nCrown of England, and the Kings and Queens of England, in their\r\npersonal or natural capacities, we have been led into a\r\nfundamental error.\" Upon this very distinction we have availed\r\nourselves. We have said, that our ancestors considered the land,\r\nwhich they took possession of in America, as out of the bounds of\r\nthe kingdom of England, and out of the reach and extent of the\r\nlaws of England; and, that the King also, even in the act of\r\ngranting the charter, considered the territory as not within the\r\nrealm; that the King had an absolute right in himself to dispose\r\nof the lands, and that this was not disputed by the nation; nor\r\ncould the lands, on any solid grounds, be claimed by the nation;\r\nand, therefore, our ancestors received the lands, by grant, from\r\nthe King; and, at the same time, compacted with him, and promised\r\nhim homage and allegiance, not in his public or politic, but\r\nnatural capacity only. If it be difficult for us to show how the\r\nKing acquired a title to this country in his natural capacity, or\r\nseparate from his relation to his subjects, which we confess, yet\r\nwe conceive, it will be equally difficult for your Excellency to\r\nshow how the body politic and nation of England acquired it. Our\r\nancestors supposed it was acquired by neither; and, therefore,\r\nthey declared, as we have before quoted from your history, that\r\nsaving their actual purchase from the natives, of the soil, the\r\ndominion, the lordship, and sovereignty, they had in the sight of\r\nGod and man, no right and title to what they possessed. How much\r\nclearer then, in natural reason and equity, must our title be, who\r\nhold estates dearly purchased at the expense of our own, as well\r\nas our ancestors labor, and defended by them with treasure and\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nYour Excellency has been pleased to confirm, rather than deny or\r\nconfute, a piece of history, which, you say, we took from an\r\nanonymous pamphlet, and by which you \"fear we have been too easily\r\nmisled.\" It may be gathered from your own declaration, and other\r\nauthorities, besides the anonymous pamphlet, that the House of\r\nCommons took exception, not at the King's having made an absolute\r\ngrant of the territory, but at the claim of an exclusive right to\r\nthe fishery on the banks and sea coast, by virtue of the patent.\r\nAt this you say, \"the House of Commons was alarmed, and a bill was\r\nbrought in for allowing a free fishery.\" And, upon this occasion,\r\nyour Excellency allows, that \"one of the Secretaries of State\r\ndeclared, that the plantations were not annexed to the Crown, and\r\nso were not within the jurisdiction of Parliament.\" If we should\r\nconcede to what your Excellency supposes might possibly or\r\n\"perhaps,\" be the case, that the Secretary made this declaration,\r\n\"as his own opinion,\" the event showed that it was the opinion of\r\nthe King too; for it is not to be accounted for upon any other\r\nprinciple, that he would have denied his royal assent to a bill,\r\nformed for no other purpose, but to grant his subjects in England,\r\nthe privilege of fishing on the sea coasts in America. The account\r\npublished by Sir Ferdinando Gorges himself, of the proceedings of\r\nParliament on this occasion, your Excellency thinks, will remove\r\nall doubt, of the sense of the nation, and of the patentees of\r\nthis patent or charter, in 1620. \"This narrative,\" you say, \"has\r\nall the appearance of truth and sincerity,\" which we do not deny;\r\nand, to us, it carries this conviction with it, that \"what was\r\nobjected\" in Parliament, was the exclusive claim of fishing only.\r\nHis imagining that he had satisfied the House, after divers\r\nattendances, that the planting a colony was of much more\r\nconsequence than a simple disorderly course of fishing, is\r\nsufficient for our conviction. We know that the nation was at that\r\ntime alarmed with apprehensions of monopolies; and, if the patent\r\nof New England was presented by the two Houses as a grievance, it\r\ndid not show, as your Excellency supposes, \"the sense they then\r\nhad of their authority over this new acquired territory,\" but only\r\ntheir sense of the grievance of a monopoly of the sea.\r\n\r\nWe are happy to hear your Excellency say, that \"our remarks upon,\r\nand construction of the words, not repugnant to the laws of\r\nEngland, are much the same with those of the Council.\" It serves\r\nto confirm us in our opinion, in what we take to be the most\r\nimportant matter of difference between your Excellency and the two\r\nHouses. After saying, that the statute of 7th and 8th of William\r\nand Mary favors the construction of the words, as intending such\r\nlaws of England as are made more immediately to respect us, you\r\ntell us, that \"the province Agent, Mr. Dummer, in his much\r\napplauded defence, says, that, then a law of the plantations may\r\nbe said to be repugnant to a law made in Great Britain, when it\r\nflatly contradicts it, so far as the law made there, mentions and\r\nrelates to the plantations.\"6 This is plain and obvious to common\r\nsense, and, therefore, cannot be denied. But, if your Excellency\r\nwould read a page or two further in that excellent defence,7 you\r\nwill see that he mentions this as the sense of the phrase, as\r\ntaken from an act of Parliament, rather than as the sense he would\r\nchoose himself to put upon it; and, he expressly designs to show,\r\nin vindication of the charter, that, in that sense of the words,\r\nthere never was a law made in the plantations repugnant to the\r\nlaws of Great Britain. He gives another construction, much more\r\nlikely to be the true intent of the words, namely, \"that the\r\npatentees shall not presume, under color of their particular\r\ncharters, to make any laws inconsistent with the great charter,\r\nand other laws of England, by which the lives, liberties, and\r\nproperties of Englishmen are secured.\"8 This is the sense in which\r\nour ancestors understood the words; and, therefore, they are\r\nunwilling to conform to the acts of trade, and disregarded them\r\ntill they made provision to give them force in the colony, by a\r\nlaw of their own; saying, that \"the laws of England did not reach\r\nAmerica; and those acts were an invasion of their rights, liberties,\r\nand properties,\" because they were not \"represented in Parliament.\"\r\nThe right of being governed by laws, which were made by persons, in\r\nwhose election they had a voice, they looked upon as the foundation\r\nof English liberties. By the compact with the King, in the charter,\r\nthey were to be as free in America, as they would have been if they\r\nhad remained within the realm; and, therefore, they freely asserted,\r\nthat they \"were to be governed by laws made by themselves, and by\r\nofficers chosen by themselves.\" Mr. Dummer says, \"it seems reasonable\r\nenough to think that the Crown,\" and, he might have added, our\r\nancestors, \"intended by this injunction to provide for all its\r\nsubjects, that they might not be oppressed by arbitrary power; but\r\nbeing still subjects, they should be protected by the same mild laws,\r\nand enjoy the same happy government, as if they continued within the\r\nrealm.\"9 And, considering the words of the charter in this light,\r\nhe looks upon them as designed to be a fence against oppression\r\nand despotic power. But the construction which your Excellency\r\nputs upon the words, reduces us to a state of vassalage, and\r\nexposes us to oppression and despotic power, whenever a Parliament\r\nshall see fit to make laws for that purpose, and put them in\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nWe flatter ourselves, that, from the large extracts we have made\r\nfrom your Excellency's history of the colony, it appears\r\nevidently, that under both charters, it hath been the sense of the\r\npeople and of the government, that they were not under the\r\njurisdiction of Parliament. We pray you again to turn to those\r\nquotations, and our observations upon them; and we wish to have your\r\nExcellency's judicious remarks. When we adduced that history, to prove\r\nthat the sentiments of private persons of influence, four or five\r\nyears after the restoration, were very different from what your\r\nExcellency apprehended them to be, when you delivered your speech, you\r\nseem to concede to it, by telling us, \"it was, as you take it, from\r\nthe principles imbibed in those times of anarchy, (preceding the\r\nrestoration,) that they disputed the authority of Parliament;\"\r\nbut, you add, \"the government would not venture to dispute it.\" We\r\nfind in the same history,10 a quotation from a letter of Mr.\r\nStoughton, dated seventeen years after the restoration, mentioning\r\n\"the country's not taking notice of the acts of navigation, to\r\nobserve them.\" And it was, as we take it, after that time, that\r\nthe government declared, in a letter to their Agents, that they\r\nhad not submitted to them; and they ventured to \"dispute\" the\r\njurisdiction, asserting, that they apprehended the acts to be an\r\ninvasion of the rights, liberties, and properties of the subjects\r\nof his Majesty in the colony, they not being represented in\r\nParliament, and that \"the laws of England did not reach America.\"\r\nIt very little avails in proof, that they conceded to the supreme\r\nauthority of Parliament, their telling the Commissioners, \"that\r\nthe act of navigation had for some years before, been observed\r\nhere; that they knew not of its being greatly violated; and that,\r\nsuch laws as appeared to be against it, were repealed.\" It may as\r\ntruly be said now, that the revenue acts are observed by some of the\r\npeople of this province; but it cannot be said that the government and\r\npeople of this province have conceded, that the Parliament had\r\nauthority to make such acts to be observed here. Neither does their\r\ndeclaration to the Commissioners, that such laws as appeared to be\r\nagainst the act of navigation, were repealed, prove their concession\r\nof the authority of Parliament, by any means, so much as their making\r\nprovision for giving force to an act of Parliament within this\r\nprovince, by a deliberate and solemn act or law of their own, proves\r\nthe contrary.\r\n\r\nYou tell us, that \"the government, four or five years before the\r\ncharter was vacated, in more explicitly,\" that is, than by a\r\nconversation with the Commissioners, \"acknowledged the authority\r\nof Parliament, and voted, that their Governor should take the oath\r\nrequired of him, faithfully to do and perform all matters and\r\nthings enjoined him by the acts of trade.\" But does this, may it\r\nplease your Excellency, show their explicit acknowledgment of the\r\nauthority of Parliament? Does it not rather show directly the\r\ncontrary? For, what could there he for their vote, or authority,\r\nto require him to take the oath already required of him, by the\r\nact of Parliament, unless both he, and they, judge that an act of\r\nParliament was not of force sufficient to bind him to take such\r\noath? We do not deny, but, on the contrary, are fully persuaded,\r\nthat your Excellency's principles in governments are still of the\r\nsame with what they appear to be in the history; for, you there\r\nsay, that \"the passing this law, plainly shows the wrong sense\r\nthey had of the relation they stood in to England.\" But we are\r\nfrom hence convinced, that your Excellency, when you wrote the\r\nhistory, was of our mind in this respect, that our ancestors, in\r\npassing the law, discovered their opinion, that they were without\r\nthe jurisdiction of Parliament; for it was upon this principle\r\nalone, they shewed the wrong sense they had in your Excellency's\r\nopinion, of the relation they stood in to England.\r\n\r\nYour Excellency, in your second speech, condescends to point out\r\nto us the acts and doings of the General Assembly, which relates\r\nto acts of Parliament, which, you think, \"demonstrates that they\r\nhave been acknowledged by the Assembly, or submitted to by the\r\npeople;\" neither of which, in our opinion, shows that it was the\r\nsense of the nation, and our predecessors, when they first took\r\npossession of this plantation, or colony, by a grant and charter\r\nfrom the Crown, that they were to remain subject to the supreme\r\nauthority of the English Parliament.\r\n\r\nYour Excellency seems chiefly to rely upon our ancestors, after\r\nthe revolution, \"proclaiming King William and Queen Mary, in the\r\nroom of King James,\" and taking the oaths to them, \"the alteration\r\nof the form of oaths, from time to time,\" and finally, \"the\r\nestablishment of the form, which every one of us has complied\r\nwith, as the charter, in express terms requires, and makes our\r\nduty.\" We do not know that it has ever been a point in dispute,\r\nwhether the Kings of England were ipso facto Kings in, and over,\r\nthis colony, or province. The compact was made between King\r\nCharles the I. his heirs and successors, and the Governor and\r\ncompany, their heirs and successors. It is easy, upon this\r\nprinciple, to account for the acknowledgment of, and submission to\r\nKing William and Queen Mary, as successors of Charles the I. in\r\nthe room of King James; besides, it is to be considered, that the\r\npeople in the colony, as well as in England, had suffered under\r\nthe tyrant James, by which, he had alike forfeited his right to\r\nreign over both. There had been a revolution here, as well as in\r\nEngland. The eyes of the people here, were upon William and Mary;\r\nand the news of their being proclaimed in England, was, as your\r\nExcellency's history tells us, \"the most joyful news ever received\r\nin New England.\"11 And, if they were not proclaimed here, \"by\r\nvirtue of an act of the colony,\" it was, as we think may be\r\nconcluded from the tenor of your history, with the general or\r\nuniversal consent of the people, as apparently, as if \"such act\r\nhad passed.\" It is consent alone, that makes any human laws\r\nbinding; and as a learned author observes, a purely voluntary\r\nsubmission to an act, because it is highly in our favor and for\r\nour benefit, is in all equity and justice, to be deemed as not at\r\nall proceeding from the right we include in the Legislators, that\r\nthey, thereby obtain an authority over us, and that ever\r\nhereafter, we must obey them of duty. We would observe, that one\r\nof the first acts of the General Assembly of this province, since\r\nthe present charter, was an act, requiring the taking the oaths\r\nmentioned in an act of Parliament, to which you refer us. For what\r\npurpose was this act of the Assembly passed, if it was the sense of\r\nthe Legislators that the act of Parliament was in force in the\r\nprovince? And, at the same time, another act was made for the\r\nestablishment of other oaths necessary to be taken; both which acts\r\nhave the royal sanction, and are now in force. Your Excellency says,\r\nthat when the colony applied to King William for a second charter,\r\nthey knew the oath the King had taken, which was to govern them\r\naccording to the statutes in Parliament, and (which your Excellency\r\nhere omits,) the laws and customs of the same. By the laws and customs\r\nof Parliament, the people of England freely debate and consent to\r\nsuch statutes as are made by themselves, or their chosen\r\nRepresentatives. This is a law, or custom, which all mankind may\r\njustly challenge as their inherent right. According to this law,\r\nthe King has an undoubted right to govern us. Your Excellency,\r\nupon recollection, surely will not infer from hence, that it was\r\nthe sense of our predecessors that there was to remain a supremacy\r\nin the English Parliament, or a full power and authority to make\r\nlaws binding upon us, in all cases whatever, in that Parliament\r\nwhere we cannot debate and deliberate upon the necessity or\r\nexpediency of any law, and, consequently, without our consent;\r\nand, as it may probably happen, destructive of the first law of\r\nsociety, the good of the whole. You tell us, that \"after the\r\nassumption of all the powers of government, by virtue of the new\r\ncharter, an act passed for the reviving, for a limited time, all\r\nthe local laws of the Massachusetts Bay and New Plymouth\r\nrespectively, not repugnant to the laws of England. And, at the\r\nsame session, an act passed establishing naval officers, that all\r\nundue trading, contrary to an act of Parliament, may be\r\nprevented.\" Among the acts that were then revived, we may\r\nreasonably suppose, was that, whereby provision was made to give\r\nforce to this act of Parliament, in the province. The\r\nestablishment, therefore, of the naval officers, was to aid the\r\nexecution of an act of Parliament, for the observance of which,\r\nwithin the colony, the Assembly had before made provision, after\r\nfree debates, with their own consent, and by their own act.\r\n\r\nThe act of Parliament, passed in 1741,12 for putting an end to\r\nseveral unwarrantable schemes, mentioned by your Excellency, was\r\ndesigned for the general good; and, if the validity of it was not\r\ndisputed, it cannot be urged as a concession of the supreme\r\nauthority, to make laws binding on us in all cases whatever. But,\r\nif the design of it was for the general benefit of the province,\r\nit was, in one respect, at least greatly complained of, by the\r\npersons more immediately affected by it; and to remedy the\r\ninconvenience, the Legislative of this province, passed an act,\r\ndirectly militating with it; which is the strongest evidence, that\r\nalthough they may have submitted, sub silentio, to some acts of\r\nParliament, that they conceived might operate for their benefit,\r\nthey did not conceive themselves bound by any of its acts, which,\r\nthey judged, would operate to the injury even of individuals.\r\n\r\nYour Excellency has not thought proper, to attempt to confute the\r\nreasoning of a learned writer on the laws of nature and nations,\r\nquoted by us, on this occasion, to shew that the authority of the\r\nLegislature does not extend so far as the fundamentals of the\r\nconstitution. We are unhappy in not having your remarks upon the\r\nreasoning of that great man; and, until it is confuted, we shall\r\nremain of the opinion, that the fundamentals of the constitution\r\nbeing excepted from the commission of the Legislators, none of the\r\nacts or doings of the General Assembly, however deliberate and\r\nsolemn, could avail to change them, if the people have not, in\r\nvery express terms, given them the power to do it; and, that much\r\nless ought their acts and doings, however numerous, which barely\r\nrefer to acts of Parliament made expressly to relate to us, to be\r\ntaken as an acknowledgment, that we are subject to the supreme\r\nauthority of Parliament.\r\n\r\nWe shall sum up our own sentiments in the words of that learned\r\nwriter, Mr. Hooker, in his Ecclesiastical Policy, as quoted by Mr.\r\nLocke. \"The lawful power of making laws to command whole political\r\nsocieties of men, belonging so properly to the same entire\r\nsocieties, that for any prince or potentate of what kind soever,\r\nto exercise the same of himself, and not from express commission,\r\nimmediately and personally received from God, is no better than\r\nmere tyranny. Laws, therefore, they are not, which public\r\napprobation hath not made so; for human laws, of what kind soever,\r\nare available by consent.\" \"Since men, naturally, have no full and\r\nperfect power to command whole politic multitudes of men,\r\ntherefore, utterly without our consent, we could in such sort, be\r\nat no man's commandment living. And to be commanded, we do not\r\nconsent, when that society. whereof we be a party, hath at any\r\ntime before consented.\" We think your Excellency has not proved,\r\neither that the colony is a part of the politic society of\r\nEngland, or that it has ever consented that the Parliament of\r\nEngland or Great Britain, should make laws binding upon us, in all\r\ncases, whether made expressly to refer to us or not.\r\n\r\nWe cannot help, before we conclude, expressing our great concern,\r\nthat your Excellency has thus repeatedly, in a manner, insisted\r\nupon our free sentiments on matters of so delicate a nature and\r\nweighty importance. The question appears to us, to be no other,\r\nthan, whether we are the subjects of absolute unlimited power, or\r\nof a free government, formed on the principles of the English\r\nconstitution. If your Excellency's doctrine be true, the people of\r\nthis province hold their lands of the Crown and people of England;\r\nand their lives, liberties, and properties, are at their disposal,\r\nand that, even by compact and their own consent. They were subject\r\nto the King as the head alterius populi of another people, in\r\nwhose Legislative they have no voice or interest. They are,\r\nindeed, said to have a constitution and a Legislative of their\r\nown; but your Excellency has explained it into a mere phantom;\r\nlimited, controled, superseded, and nullified, at the will of\r\nanother. Is this the constitution which so charmed our ancestors,\r\nthat, as your Excellency has informed us, they kept a day of\r\nsolemn thanksgiving to Almighty God when they received it? And\r\nwere they men of so little discernment, such children in\r\nunderstanding, as to please themselves with the imagination, that\r\nthey were blessed with the same rights and liberties which natural\r\nborn subjects in England enjoyed, when, at the same time, they had\r\nfully consented to be ruled and ordered by a Legislative, a\r\nthousand leagues distant from them, which cannot be supposed to be\r\nsufficiently acquainted with their circumstances, if concerned for\r\ntheir interest, and in which, they cannot be in any sense\r\nrepresented?\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Hutchinson is the principal authority for the statement that\r\nthis document, as well as that of January 26, 1773, was prepared\r\nby Adams.
