The one has a history,\r\nwhich the other as yet has not, and of all people in the world, our own\r\ndear countrymen--with all their talk about Niagara, and enormous lakes,\r\nand prodigious rivers--care the least for great natural features of\r\ncountry, and the most for historical and romantic associations. When an\r\nEnglishman, landing at New York, begins at once to inquire for the\r\nprairies, it is only very polite New Yorkers who can refrain from\r\nlaughing at him.\r\n\r\nBut it is not so much of natural features that I wish to speak at\r\npresent. Illinois has been abused lately; brought into discredit by the\r\nmisbehavior of some of her sons; but this only makes her loyal friends\r\nlove her the more, knowing well how good her heart is, how high-toned\r\nher feeling, how determined her courage.\r\n\r\nLooking at this State from New York, the image is that of a great green\r\nprairie, the monotony of whose surface is scarcely broken by the rivers\r\nwhich cross it here and there, and the great lines of railroad that\r\nserve as causeways through the desperate mud of spring and winter. A\r\nscattered people, who till the unctuous black soil only too easily, and\r\nleave as much of the crop rotting on the ground through neglect as would\r\nsupport the entire population; rude though thriving towns, where the\r\ngrocery and the tavern, the ball room and the race course are more\r\nlovingly patronized than the church, the Sunday school, and the lyceum;\r\nwhere party spirit runs high, and elections are attended to, whatever\r\nelse may be forgotten; where very unseemly jokes are current, and\r\nlanguage far from choice passes unrebuked in society; in short, where\r\nwhat are known as 'Western characteristics' bear undisputed sway, making\r\ntheir natal region anything but a congenial residence for strangers of\r\nan unaccommodating disposition--such is the picture.\r\n\r\nIt were useless to deny that most of the points here indicated would be\r\nrecognized and placed on his map by a Moral and Social topographer who\r\nshould make the tour of the entire State from Cairo to Dunleith, both\r\ninclusive; but it is none the less certain that if he noted only these\r\nhe would ill deserve his title. Cicero had a huge, unsightly wart on\r\nhis eloquent nose; the fair mother of Queen Elizabeth, a 'supplemental\r\nnail' on one of her beautiful hands; Italy has her Pontine Marshes, New\r\nYork city her 'Sixth Ward'; but he must be a green-eyed monster indeed\r\nwho would represent these as characteristics. Illinois deserves an\r\nexplorer with clear, kind eyes, and a historiographer as genial as\r\nMotley. All in good time. She will 'grow' these, probably. While we are\r\nwaiting for them, let us prepare a few jottings for their use.\r\n\r\nA great State is a great thing, certainly, but mere extent or mere\r\nmaterial wealth, without intellectual and social refinement and a high\r\nmoral tone, can never excite very deep interest. Not that we can expect\r\nto find every desirable thing actually existent in a country as soon as\r\nit is partially settled and in possession of the first necessities of\r\nhuman society. But we may expect aspirations after the best things, and\r\na determination to acquire and uphold them. These United States of\r\nours--God bless them forever!--have a constitutional provision against\r\nthe undue preponderance of physical advantages over those of a higher\r\nkind. Rhode Island (loyal to the core), and Delaware (just loyal enough\r\nto keep her sweet), each sends her two Senators to Congress; and huge\r\nIllinois--whom certain ill-advised Philistines are trying to make a\r\nblind Samson of--can send no more. If we say the State that sends the\r\nbest men is the greatest State (for the time, especially the present\r\ntime), 'all the people shall answer Amen!' for one loyal heart, just\r\nnow, is more precious than millions of fat acres. Whether Illinois could\r\nprudently submit to this appraisal, just at the present moment, remains\r\nto be proved; but that her heart is loyal as well as brave, there can be\r\nno question.\r\n\r\nWithout going back, in philosophical style, to the creation of the\r\nworld, we may say that the State had a good beginning. Father Marquette\r\nand his pious comrade Allouez, both soldiers of the Cross, explored her\r\nnorthern wilds for God, and not for greed. They saw her solid and serene\r\nbeauty, and presaged her greatness, and they did all that wise and\r\ndevoted Catholic missionaries could do toward sanctifying her soil to\r\ngood ends forever. They found 'a peaceful and manly tribe' in her\r\ninterior, the name Illinois signifying 'men of men,' and the superiority\r\nof the tribe to all the other Indians of the region justifying the\r\nappellation. Allouez said, 'Their country is the best field for the\r\ngospel,' and he planted it as well as he could with what he believed to\r\nbe the Tree of Life, long nourished with the prayers and tears of\r\nhimself and his successors. The Indians took kindly to the teaching of\r\nthe good and wise Frenchman, and it is said that even after troubles had\r\nbegun to arise, owing, as usual, to the misconduct of rapacious and\r\nunprincipled white settlers, many of the Indians held fast by their\r\nnewly adopted faith, and even showed some good fruits of it in\r\nforbearance and honesty of dealing. All this was not far from\r\ncontemporary with the period when Cotton Mather, in New England, while\r\nteaching the principles of civil government, was persecuting Quakers and\r\nburning witches; and in yet another part of the new country, William\r\nPenn, neither Catholic nor Puritan, was making fair and honest treaties\r\nwith savages, and winning them, by the negative virtue of truthfulness,\r\nto believe that white men could be friends.\r\n\r\nThe Great Colbert, minister to Louis XIV, under whose auspices the\r\nFrench missionaries had been sent out, very soon came to the conclusion\r\nthat it was important to enlarge and strengthen French influence in this\r\ngreat new country, particularly after he had ascertained the existence\r\nof the 'Great River,' which Father Marquette had undertaken to explore,\r\nand by means of which he expected to open trade with China! But the\r\nminister of finance required rather more worldly agents than the\r\nsingle-hearted and devoted ministers of religion, and he found a fitting\r\ninstrument in the young and ardent Robert de la Salle, a Frenchman of\r\nenterprise and sagacity, worldly enough in his motives, but of\r\nindomitable energy and perseverance. He was very successful in\r\nestablishing commerce in furs and other productions of the country, but\r\nlost his life somewhere near the mouth of the Mississippi, which he\r\nfirst explored, after escaping a thousand dangers. His name is famous in\r\nthe land, and a large town was called after it; but what would he say if\r\nhe heard his patronymic transformed into 'Lay-séll,' as it is,\r\nuniversally, among the 'natives'?\r\n\r\nIt is in La Salle's first _procès verbal_ for his government that we\r\nfind the first mention of the river 'Chekagou,' a lonely stream then,\r\nbut which now reflects a number of houses and stores, tall steeples,\r\ncolossal grain depots, and--the splendid edifice which fitly enshrines\r\nthe northern terminus of the Illinois Central Railroad, the greatest\r\nrailway in the world, and certainly one of the wonders which even the\r\nambitious and sanguine La Salle never dreamed of; a daily messenger of\r\nlight and life through seven hundred miles of country, which, without\r\nit, would have remained a wilderness to this day.\r\n\r\nThe first settler on the banks of this now so famous river was a black\r\nman from St. Domingo, Jean Baptiste Point-au-Sable by name, who brought\r\nsome wealth with him, and built a residence which must have seemed grand\r\nfor that time and place. He did not stay long, however, and the Indians,\r\nwho had probably suffered some things from the arrogance of their white\r\nneighbors, thought it a good joke to say that 'the first 'white man'\r\nthat settled there was a negro.' Like some other jokes, this one seems\r\nto have rankled deep and long, for to this day Illinois tolerates\r\nneither negro nor Indian. The Indian, _as_ an Indian, has no foothold in\r\nthe State; and the negro, even in the guise of born and skilled laborer\r\nin the production of the crops which form the wealth of the country, and\r\nof the new ones which are to be transplanted hither in consequence of\r\nthe war, is forbidden, under heavy penalties, to set foot within her\r\nboundaries--the threat of slavery, like a flaming sword, guarding the\r\nentrance of this paradise of the laborer.\r\n\r\nIllinois has not suffered as much in tone and character from\r\nunprincipled speculators as some others of the new States. Her early\r\nsettlers were generally men of muscle, mental as well as bodily; men who\r\ndid not so much expect to live by their wits and other people's folly,\r\nas by their own industry and enterprise. Among the early inhabitants of\r\nChicago and other important towns, were some whose talents and character\r\nwould have been valuable anywhere. Public spirit abounded, and the men\r\nof that day evidently felt as men should feel who are destined to be the\r\nancestors of great cities. In 1837, when the business affairs of Chicago\r\nwere in a distressing state, and private insolvency was rather the rule\r\nthan the exception, many debtors and a few demagogues called a public\r\nmeeting, the real though not the avowed object of which was to bring\r\nabout some form of repudiation. Some inflammatory suggestions, designed\r\nto excite to desperate thoughts those whose affairs were cruelly\r\nembarrassed, having wrought up the assembly to the point of forgetting\r\nall but the distresses of the moment, a call was made for the mayor, who\r\ncame forward, and in a few calm and judicious words besought all present\r\nto pause before they ventured on dishonorable expedients. He entreated\r\nthem to bear up with the courage of men, remembering that no calamity\r\nwas so great as the loss of self-respect; that it were better for them\r\nto conceal their misfortunes than to proclaim them; that many a fortress\r\nhad been saved by the courage of its defenders, and their determination\r\nto conceal its weakened condition at all sacrifices. 'Above all things,'\r\nhe said, 'do not tarnish the honor of our infant city!'\r\n\r\nThese manly words called up manly thoughts, and the hour of danger\r\npassed by.\r\n\r\nAt one time the legislature were induced, by means of various tricks,\r\ntogether with some touches of that high-handed insolence by which such\r\nthings are accomplished, to pass a resolution for a convention to alter\r\nthe constitution of the State, with a view to the introduction of\r\nSLAVERY. One of the newspapers ventured an article which exposed the\r\nscandalous means by which the resolutions had been carried through the\r\nHouse. The 'proofs' of this article were stolen from the printing\r\noffice, and the parties implicated in this larceny attempted to induce a\r\nmob to demolish the office and the offending editor. But the pluck which\r\noriginated the stinging article sufficed for the defence of the office.\r\nThe effort to establish slavery in Illinois was kept up for a year or\r\nmore, but the bold editor and other friends of freedom labored\r\nincessantly for the honor of the State, and succeeded at length in\r\nprocuring an overwhelming vote against the threatened disgrace.\r\n\r\nLaws against duelling are laughed at in other States, but Illinois made\r\nhers in earnest, affixing the penalty of death to the deliberate killing\r\nof a man, even under the so-called code of honor. This severe law did\r\nnot suffice to prevent a fatal duel, the actors of which probably\r\nexpected to elude the penalty with the usual facility. The State,\r\nhowever, in all simplicity, hung the survivor, and from that day to this\r\nhas had no further occasion for such severity.\r\n\r\nOf late, the same Personage who has in all ages been disposed to buy\r\nmen's souls at his own delusive price, and to make his dupes sign the\r\ninfernal contract with their blood, has been very busy in certain parts\r\nof the State, trying to get signatures, under the miserable pretence\r\nthat party pays better than patriotism, and that times of whirlwind and\r\ndisaster are those in which he, the contractor, has most power to\r\nadvance the interests of his adherents. But some of those who listened\r\nmost greedily to the glozings of the arch deceiver begin already to\r\nrepent, and are ready to call upon higher powers to interfere and efface\r\nthe record of their momentary weakness. In all _diablerie_ the _fiat_ of\r\na superior can release a victim, so we may hope that godlike patriotism\r\nmay not only forgive the penitent, but absolve him from the consequences\r\nof his own rash folly. To have been instrumental in dimming for one\r\nmoment the glorious escutcheon of Illinois, requires pardon. To such\r\nwords as have been spoken by some of her sons we may apply the poet's\r\nsentence:\r\n\r\n  'To speak them were a deadly sin!\r\n  And for having but thought them thy heart within\r\n  A treble penance must be done.'\r\n\r\nThe recent Message of Governor Yates is full of spirit, the right\r\nspirit, a warm and generous, a courageous and patriotic one. He glories\r\nin the great things he has to tell, but it is not 'as the fool\r\nboasteth,' but rather as the apostle, who, when he recounts only plain\r\nand manifest truths, says, 'Bear with me.' And truly, what wonders have\r\nbeen achieved by the 'men of men'! Since the war began, Illinois, though\r\nshe has given one hundred and thirty-five thousand of her able-bodied\r\nmen to the field, and though the closing of the Mississippi has produced\r\nincalculable loss, has sent away food enough to supply ten millions of\r\npeople, and she has now remaining, of last year's produce, as much as\r\ncan be shipped in a year. This enormous productiveness has given rise to\r\nthe idea that Illinois is principally a grain-growing State, but she\r\nnone the less possesses every requisite for commerce and manufactures.\r\nNot content even in war time with keeping up all her old sources of\r\nwealth, she has added to the list the production of sugar, tobacco, and\r\neven cotton, all of which have been found to flourish in nearly every\r\nportion of the State. The seventh State in point of population in 1850,\r\nshe was the fourth in 1860, and in the production of coal she has made a\r\nsimilar advance. In railroads she is in reality the first, though\r\nnominally only the second; possessing three thousand miles, intersecting\r\nthe State in all directions. Ten years ago the cost of all the railroad\r\nproperty within her bounds was about $1,500,000; in 1860 it was\r\n$104,944,561--an instance of progress unparalleled. But these are not\r\nthe greatest things.\r\n\r\nEducation receives the most enlightened attention, and all that the\r\nruling powers can accomplish in persuading the people to avail\r\nthemselves of the very best opportunities for mental enlargement and\r\ngenerous cultivation is faithfully done. It is for the people themselves\r\nto decide whether they will be content with the mere rudiments of\r\neducation, or accept its highest gifts, gratis, at the hands of the\r\nState. If the pursuit of the material wealth which lies so temptingly\r\naround them should turn aside their thoughts from this far greater boon,\r\nor so pervert their minds as to render them insensible to its value,\r\nthey will put that material wealth to shame. It is true that in some\r\ncases the disgust felt by loyal citizens at infamous political\r\ninterference may have operated to prevent their sending their children\r\nto school; but these evils are sectional and limited, and the schools\r\nthemselves will, before long, so enlighten the dark regions as to render\r\nsuch stupidity impossible. It is to the infinite credit of the State\r\nthat since the war began there has been no diminution, but on the\r\ncontrary, an increase in schools, both private and public, in number of\r\npupils, teachers, school houses, and amount of school funds. Of eight\r\nthousand two hundred and twenty-three male teachers in 1860, _three\r\nthousand_ went to the war, showing that it is among her most intelligent\r\nand instructed classes that we are to look for the patriotism of\r\nIllinois. The deficiency thus created operated legitimately and\r\nadvantageously in giving employment to a greatly increased number of\r\nfemale teachers.\r\n\r\nAs to patriotism, let not the few bring disgrace upon the many. It is\r\ntrue that scarcely a day passes unmarked by the discovery that some\r\ngrovelling wretch has been writing to the army to persuade soldiers to\r\ndesert on political grounds; yet as these disgraceful letters, as\r\npublished in the papers, give conclusive proof of the utter ignorance of\r\ntheir writers, we must not judge the spirit of the State by them, any\r\nmore than by the louder disloyal utterances of men who have not their\r\nexcuse. Governor Yates speaks for the PEOPLE when he says:\r\n\r\n     'Our State has stood nobly by the Constitution and the Union. She\r\n     has not faltered for a moment in her devotion. She has sent her\r\n     sons in thousands to defend the Flag and avenge the insults heaped\r\n     upon it by the traitor hordes who have dared to trail it in the\r\n     dust. On every battle field she has poured out her blood, a willing\r\n     sacrifice, and she still stands ready to do or die. She has sent\r\n     out also the Angel of Mercy side by side with him who carries the\r\n     flaming sword of War. On the battle field, amid the dying and the\r\n     dead; in the hospital among the sick and wounded of our State, may\r\n     be seen her sons and daughters, ministering consolation and\r\n     shedding the blessings of a divine charity which knows no fear,\r\n     which dreadeth not the pestilence that walketh by night or the\r\n     bullet of the foe by day.'\r\n\r\nGovernor Yates himself, on receiving intelligence of the battle of Fort\r\nDonelson, repaired at once to the scene of suffering, feeling--like the\r\nlamented Governor Harvey of Wisconsin, who lost his life in the same\r\nservice--that where public good is to be done, the State should be\r\nworthily and effectively represented by her chief executive officer.\r\nThere on the spot, trusting to no hearsay, Mr. Yates, while distributing\r\nthe bounteous stores of which he was the bearer, ascertained by actual\r\nobservation the condition and wants of the troops, and at once set about\r\ndevising measures of relief. After Shiloh, that Golgotha of our brave\r\nboys, the Governor organized a large corps of surgeons and nurses, and\r\nwent himself to Pittsburg Landing to find such suffering and such\r\ndestitution as ought never to exist on the soil of our bounteous land,\r\nunder any possible conjuncture of circumstances, however untoward and\r\nunprecedented. Without surgeons or surgical appliances, without hospital\r\nsupplies, and, above all, worse than all, without SYSTEM, there lay the\r\ndefenders of our national life, their wounds baking in the hot sun,\r\nworms devouring their substance while yet the breath of life kept their\r\ndesolate hearts beating. Doing all that could be done on the spot, and\r\nbringing away all who could be brought, the Governor returned, sending\r\nthe adjutant-general back on the same errand, and going himself a second\r\ntime as soon as a new supply of surgeons and sanitary stores,\r\ncontributed by private kindness, could be got together. And so on, as\r\nlong as the necessity existed. The great expenses involved in the relief\r\nand transportation of many thousands of sick and wounded, expenses\r\nunusual and not provided for by law, were gladly borne by the State, and\r\ncareful provision was made against the recurrence of the evil. May our\r\nHeavenly Father in His great mercy so order the future as to make these\r\npreparations unnecessary, wise and humane though they be! Says Governor\r\nYates:\r\n\r\n     'I have hope for my country, because I think the right policy has\r\n     been adopted. There remains but one other thing to make my\r\n     assurance doubly sure; and that is, I want to see no divisions\r\n     among the friends of the Union in the loyal States. Could I know\r\n     that the people of the Free States were willing to ignore party,\r\n     and resolved to act with one purpose and one will for the vigorous\r\n     prosecution of the war and the restoration of the Union, then I\r\n     should have no doubt of a happy end to all our difficulties. * * *\r\n\r\n     'If the members of this General Assembly, and the press and people\r\n     of Illinois, in the spirit of lofty patriotism, could lay aside\r\n     everything of a party character, and evince to the country, to our\r\n     army, and, especially to the secession States, that we are one in\r\n     heart and sentiment for every measure for the vigorous prosecution\r\n     of the war, it would have a more marked effect upon the suppression\r\n     of the rebellion than great victories achieved over the enemy upon\r\n     the battle field. For, when the North shall present an undivided\r\n     front--a stern and unfaltering purpose to exhaust every available\r\n     means to suppress the rebellion, then the last prop of the latter\r\n     will have fallen from under it, and it will succumb and sue for\r\n     peace. Should divisions mark our councils, or any considerable\r\n     portion of our people give signs of hesitation, then a shout of\r\n     exultation will go up, throughout all the hosts of rebeldom, and\r\n     bonfires and illuminations be kindled in every Southern city,\r\n     hailing our divisions as the sure harbingers of their success. We\r\n     must stand by the President, and send up to him, and to our brave\r\n     armies in the field, the support of an undivided sentiment and one\r\n     universal cheer from the masses of all the loyal States. The stern\r\n     realities of actual war have produced unanimity among our soldiers\r\n     in the army. With them the paltry contests of men for political\r\n     power dwindle into insignificance before the mightier question of\r\n     the preservation of the national life. Coming into closer contact\r\n     with Southern men and society, the sentiments of those who looked\r\n     favorably upon Southern institutions have shifted round. They have\r\n     now formed their own opinions of the proper relations of the\r\n     Federal Government to them, which no sophistry of the mere\r\n     politician can ever change. Seeing for themselves slavery and its\r\n     effects upon both master and slave, they learn to hate it and swear\r\n     eternal hostility to it in their hearts. Fighting for their\r\n     country, they learn doubly to love it. Fighting for the Union, they\r\n     resolve to preserve, at all hazards, the glorious palladium of our\r\n     liberties.\r\n\r\n     'I believe this infernal rebellion can be, ought to be, and will be\r\n     subdued. The land may be left a howling waste, desolated by the\r\n     bloody footsteps of war, from Delaware bay to the gulf, but our\r\n     territory shall remain unmutilated--the country shall be one, and\r\n     it shall be free in all its broad boundaries, from Maine to the\r\n     gulf, and from ocean to ocean.\r\n\r\n     'In any event, may we be able to act a worthy part in the trying\r\n     scenes through which we are passing; and should the star of our\r\n     destiny sink to rise no more, may we feel for ourselves and may\r\n     history preserve our record clear before heaven and earth, and hand\r\n     down the testimony to our children, that we have done all, perilled\r\n     and endured all, to perpetuate the priceless heritage of Liberty\r\n     and Union, unimpaired to our posterity.'\r\n\r\nAnd in this fervid utterance of our warm-hearted Governor, the free\r\nchoice of a free people, let us consider Illinois as expressing her\r\nhonest sentiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA WINTER IN CAMP.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was painfully infusing my own 'small Latin and less Greek' into the\r\nyoung Shakspeares of a Western college, when the appointment of a friend\r\nto the command of the ----th Iowa regiment opened to me a place upon his\r\nstaff. Three days afterward, in one of the rough board-shanties of Camp\r\nMcClellan, I was making preparations for my first dress parade. The less\r\nsaid of the _dress_ of that parade, the better. There was no lack of\r\ncomfortable clothing, but every man had evidently worn the suit he was\r\nmost willing to throw away when his Uncle Samuel presented him with a\r\nnew one; and a regiment of such suits drawn up in line, made but a sorry\r\nfigure in comparison with the smartly uniformed ----th, which had just\r\nleft the ground. Their colonel, in the first glory of his sword and\r\nshoulder straps, was replaced by a very rough-looking individual, with a\r\nshabby slouched hat pushed far back on his head, and a rusty overcoat,\r\nopen just far enough to show the place where a cravat might have been.\r\nIt was very plain, as he stood there with his arms folded, thin lips\r\ncompressed, and gray eyes hardly visible under their shaggy brows, that\r\nwhether he _looked_ the colonel or not was the last thought likely to\r\ntrouble him. I fancied that he did, in spite of all, and that he saw a\r\ngreat deal of good stuff in the party-colored rows before him, which he\r\nwould know how to use when the right moment came: subsequent events\r\nproved that I was not mistaken. The regiment had no reason to be ashamed\r\nof their rough colonel, even when the two hundred that were left of them\r\nlaid down their arms late in the afternoon of that bloody Sabbath at\r\nShiloh, on the very spot where the swelling tide of rebels had beaten\r\nupon them like a rock all day long.\r\n\r\nBut these after achievements are no part of my present story. The more\r\nstriking passages of this great war for freedom will be well and fully\r\ntold. Victories like Donelson, death-struggles like that on the plains\r\nof Shiloh, will take their place in ample proportions on the page of\r\nhistory. As years roll on they will stand out in strong relief, and be\r\nthe mountain tops which receding posterity will still recognize when all\r\nthe rest has sunk beneath the horizon. It were well that some record\r\nshould also be made of the long and dull days and weeks and months that\r\nintervened between these stirring incidents: at least that enough should\r\nbe told of them to remind our children that they existed, and in this as\r\nin all other wars, made up the great bulk of its toils. This indeed\r\nseems the hardest lesson for every one but soldiers to learn. Few but\r\nthose who have had actual experience know how small a part fighting\r\nplays in war; how little of the soldier's hardships and privations, how\r\nlittle of his dangers even are met upon the battle field. Tame as\r\nstories of barrack life must seem when we are thrilling with the great\r\nevents for which that life furnishes the substratum, it is worth our\r\nwhile, for the sake of this lesson, to give them also their page upon\r\nthe record, to spread these neutral tints in due proportion upon the\r\nbroad canvas. It is partly for this reason that I turn back to sketch\r\nthe trivial and monotonous scenes of a winter in barracks. It is well to\r\nremind you, dear young friends, feminine and otherwise, at home, that a\r\ngreat many days and nights of patient labor go to one brilliant battle.\r\nWhen your loudest huzzas and your sweetest smiles are showered on the\r\nlucky ones who have achieved great deeds and walked through the red\r\nbaptism of fire, remember also how much true courage and fortitude have\r\nbeen shown in bearing the daily hardships of the camp, without the\r\nexcitement of hand-to-hand conflict.\r\n\r\nThe new uniforms came at last, and all the slang epithets with which our\r\nregiment had been received were duly transferred to the newly arrived\r\nsquads of the next in order. Then we began to speculate on the time and\r\nmode of our departure. It was remarkable how keenly the most contented\r\ndispositions entered into these questions. There is in military life a\r\nmonotony of routine, and at the same time a constant mental excitement,\r\nthat make change--change of some sort, even from better to worse--almost\r\na necessity. I had already stretched myself in my bunk one evening, and\r\nwas half asleep, when I heard joyful voices cry out, 'That's good!' and\r\nunerring instinct told me that orders had come for the ----th to move.\r\nOn the third day again we stood in our ranks upon the muddy esplanade of\r\nthe Benton Barracks, patiently waiting for the A. A. A. G. and the P. Q.\r\nM. to get through the voluminous correspondence which was to result in\r\nquarters and rations. At least twenty thousand men were crowded at that\r\ntime into this dismal quadrangle. Perseverance and patience could\r\novercome the prevalent impression at the commissary that every new\r\nregiment was a set of unlawful intruders, to be starved out if possible,\r\nbut could not conquer the difficulty of crowding material bodies into\r\nless space than they had been created to fill. Two companies had to be\r\npacked into each department intended for one. As for 'field and staff,'\r\nthey were worse off than the privates, and took their first useful\r\nlesson in the fact that they were by no means such distinguished\r\nindividuals in the large army as they had been when showing off their\r\nnew uniforms at home. It must have been comforting to over-sensitive\r\nprivates to hear how colonels and quartermasters were snubbed in their\r\nturn by the 'general staff.' The regimental headquarters, where these\r\ncrest-fallen dignitaries should have laid their weary heads, were\r\ntenanted by Captains A., who had a pretty wife with him, and B., who\r\ngave such nice little suppers, and C., whose mother was first cousin to\r\nthe ugly half-breed that blew the general's trumpet from the roof of the\r\ngreat house in the centre. Wherefore the colonel, the surgeon, the\r\nchaplain, the quartermaster, and the 'subscriber' were content to spread\r\ntheir blankets for the first night with a brace of captains, on the\r\nparticularly dirty floor of Company F., and dream those 'soldier dreams'\r\nin which Mrs. Soldier and two or three little soldiers--assorted\r\nsizes--run down to the garden gate to welcome the hero home again, while\r\nguardian angels clap their wings in delight and take a receipt for him\r\nas 'delivered in good order and well-conditioned' to the deities that\r\npreside over the domestic altar.\r\n\r\nSuch dreams as these were easy matters for most of us, who had no\r\nexperience. With our regimental colors fresh from the hands of the two\r\ninevitable young ladies in white, who had presented them (with remarks\r\nsuitable to the occasion), we saw nothing before us but a march of\r\ndouble quick to 'glory or the grave.' Luckily we had cooler heads among\r\nus: men who had fought in Mexico, camped in the gulches of California,\r\ndrilled hordes of Indians in South America, led men in desperate\r\nstarving marches over the plains. These went about making us comfortable\r\nin a very prosaic, practical way. The first call for volunteers from the\r\nranks was not to defend a breach or lead a forlorn hope, as we had\r\nnaturally expected, but--for carpenters. They were set to knocking down\r\nthe clumsy bunks in the men's quarters and rebuilding them in more\r\nconvenient shape, piercing the roof for ventilators, building shanties\r\nfor the dispensary and the quartermaster's stores. Colonel and chaplain\r\nmade a daily tour of the cook rooms and commissary, smelt of meat,\r\ntasted hard bread, dived into dinner pots, examined coffee grounds to\r\nsee whether any of the genuine article had accidentally got mixed with\r\nthe post supply of burnt peas. The surgeon commenced vaccinating the\r\nmen, and taking precautions against every possible malady, old age, I\r\nbelieve, included. Meanwhile the adjutant and the sergeant-major shut\r\nthemselves up in a back room like a counting house, and were kept busy\r\ncopying muster rolls, posting huge ledger-like books, making out daily\r\nand nightly returns, receiving and answering elaborate letters from the\r\nofficial personages in the next building. The company officers and men\r\nwere assigned their regular hours for drill, as well as for everything\r\nelse that men could think of doing in barracks. In short, we found\r\nourselves all drawn into the operations of a vast, cumbrous, slow-moving\r\nmachine, with a great many more cogs than drivers, through which no\r\nregiment or any other body could pass rapidly. The time required in our\r\ncase was nearly three months.\r\n\r\nHow much of this delay was necessary or beneficial I leave for wiser\r\nmilitary critics than myself to discuss. The complaint it awakened at\r\nthe time has almost been forgotten in the glory of the achievements\r\nwhich followed when the great army actually began to move. Perhaps it is\r\nremembered only by those who mourn the brave young hearts that never\r\nreached the battle field, but perished in the inglorious conflict with\r\ndisease and idleness. Few appreciate the fearful loss suffered from\r\nthese causes, unless they were present from day to day, watching the\r\nregular morning reports, or meeting the frequent burial squads that\r\nthronged the road to the cemetery. Even in a place like St. Louis, with\r\namply provided hospitals, and all the appliances of medical skill at\r\nhand, men died at a rate which would have carried off half the army\r\nbefore its three years' service expired. And of these deaths by far the\r\ngreater portion were the direct consequence of idleness and its\r\nconsequent evils in camp. The healthiest body of troops I saw in\r\nMissouri were busy night and day with scouting parties, and living in\r\ntheir tents upon a bleak hilltop, ten miles from the nearest hospital or\r\nsurgeon. When their regiment was concentrated after four months'\r\nservice, this company alone marched in the hundred and one men it had\r\nbrought from home, not a single man missing or on the sick list.\r\nPerhaps another such instance could scarcely be found in the whole army.\r\n\r\nBut it was not by death alone that precious material wasted faster than\r\na whole series of battles could carry it off. Under such circumstances\r\nthe living rot as well as the dead. Physically and morally the men\r\ndeteriorate for want of occupation that interests them. Most of our\r\nWestern volunteers were farmers' boys, fresh from an active, outdoor\r\nlife. They were shut up in the barracks, with no exercise but three or\r\nfour hours of monotonous drill, no outdoor life but a lounge over the\r\nlevel parade ground, and no amusements but cards and the sutler's shop.\r\nTheir very comforts were noxious. The warm, close barracks in which they\r\nspent perhaps twenty hours out of the twenty-four, would enervate even a\r\nman trained to sedentary habits; and the abundant rations of hot food,\r\nconsumed with the morbid appetite of men who had no other amusement,\r\nrendered them heavy and listless. In our regiment, at least, it was\r\nabsolutely necessary to cut down the rations of certain articles, as for\r\ninstance of coffee, and to prevent their too frequent use. The cooks\r\ntold us that it was not an uncommon thing for a man to consume from four\r\nto six quarts of hot coffee at the three meals of a single day.\r\n\r\nUpon their minds the influence was even greater than upon their bodies.\r\nMore enthusiastic soldiers never assembled in the world than came up\r\nfrom all parts of the country to the various rendezvous of our\r\nvolunteers. This is not merely the partial judgment of a fellow\r\ncountryman. In conversation with old European officers of great\r\nexperience, who had spent the autumn in instructing different regiments,\r\nI have heard testimony to this effect more flattering than anything\r\nwhich I, as an American, should dare to say. Of course a part of this\r\nenthusiasm was founded on an illusion which experience must sooner or\r\nlater have dispelled; but wise policy would have husbanded it as long as\r\npossible, by putting them into service which should at the same time\r\nhave fed their love of adventure and given them practice in arms. Even\r\nas a matter of drill--which to some of our officers seems to be the\r\ngreat end, and not merely the means of a soldier's life--this would have\r\nbeen an advantage. The drill of a camp of instruction is not only\r\nmonotonous, but meaningless, because neither officers nor men are yet\r\nalive to its practical application. Had these men been placed at once\r\nwhere something _seemed_ to depend on their activity, instruction in\r\ntactics would have been eagerly sought after, instead of being looked\r\nupon as an irksome daily task. Nor would it have been necessary for this\r\npurpose to place raw troops in positions of critical importance. The\r\nvast extent of our line of operations, and the wide tracts of\r\ndisaffected country which were, or _might easily have been_, left behind\r\nit, offered an ample field for a training as thorough as the most rigid\r\nmartinet could desire, at a safe distance from any enemy in force, but\r\nwhere they would have been kept under the _qui vive_ by the belief that\r\nsomething was intrusted to them. Drill or no drill, I do not think there\r\nwas a colonel in the barracks who did not know that his men would have\r\nbeen worth more if marched from the place of enlistment directly into\r\nthe open field, than they were after months in a place where the whole\r\ntendency was to chill their patriotism by making them feel useless, and\r\nto wear off the fine edge of their patriotism by subjection to the\r\nmerest mechanical process of instruction.\r\n\r\nBut without dwelling longer on a subject still so delicate as this, let\r\nit be said that the advantages of the camp of instruction were\r\nprincipally with the officers. These really learned many things they\r\nneeded to know, and perhaps unlearned some that they needed as much to\r\nforget. I have hinted already at one of these latter lessons--that of\r\ntheir own insignificance. Familiarity breeds contempt, even with\r\nshoulder straps. It did the captains and majors and colonels, each of\r\nwhom had been for a time the particular hero of his own village or\r\ncounty, not a little good to find themselves lost in the crowd, and\r\nquite overshadowed by the stars of the brigadiers. Even these latter did\r\nnot look quite so portentous and dazzling when we saw them in whole\r\nconstellations, paling their ineffectual rays before the luminary of\r\nheadquarters. Many an ambitious youth, who had come from home with very\r\ngrand though vague ideas of the personal influence he was to have upon\r\nthe country's destinies, found it a wholesome exercise to stand in the\r\nmud at the gate all day as officer of the guard, and touch his hat\r\nobsequiously to the general staff. If there was good stuff in him he\r\nsoon got over the first disappointment, and learned to put his shoulder\r\nmore heartily to that of his men, when he found that his time was by no\r\nmeans too valuable to be chiefly spent in very insignificant\r\nemployments. Some few, it is true, never could have done this, even if\r\nthey had been brayed in a mortar. I remember one fussy little cavalry\r\nadjutant, who never allowed a private to pass him without a salute, or\r\nsit down in his presence. I lost sight of the fellow soon afterward, but\r\nit was with great satisfaction that I saw his name gazetted a week or\r\ntwo since, 'dismissed the service.'\r\n\r\nAs for regular instruction in tactics, there was perhaps as much as the\r\nnature of the case admitted, to wit, none at all. Every now and then a\r\nfine system would be organized, and promulgated in general orders.\r\nSometimes a series of recitations were prescribed that would have\r\ndismayed a teachers' institute. Field officers were to say their lessons\r\nevery evening at headquarters, and head classes from their own line in\r\nthe forenoon. The company officers in turn were to teach\r\nnon-commissioned ideas how to shoot. Playing truant was strictly\r\nforbidden; careless officers who should 'fail to acquire the lesson set\r\nfor them' were to be reported, and, I presume, the unlucky man who\r\nmissed a question would have seen 'the next' go above him till the\r\nbright boy of each class had worked his way up to the head. These\r\nsystems did _not_ prove a failure: they simply never went at all, but\r\nwere quietly and unanimously ignored by teacher and teachee. Every man\r\nwas left to thumb his Hardee in private, and find out what he lacked by\r\nhis daily blunders on drill. These furnished ample subject for private\r\nstudy, as well as for animated discussion among the other military\r\ntopics that occupied our leisure. Emulation and the fear of ridicule\r\nkept even the most indolent at work.\r\n\r\nIt was amusing to see how rapidly the _esprit de corps_--their own\r\nfavorite word, which they took infinite pleasure in repeating on all\r\noccasions--grew upon our newly made warriors. How learned they were upon\r\nall the details of 'the service,' and how particularly jealous of the\r\nhonors and importance of their own particular 'arm!' I used to listen\r\nwith infinite relish to the discussion in our colonel's quarters, which\r\nhappened to be a favorite rendezvous for the field officers of some half\r\ndozen different regiments, during the idle hours of the long winter\r\nevenings. No matter how the conversation commenced, it was sure to come\r\ndown to this at last, and cavalry, infantry, and artillery blazed away\r\nat each other in a voluble discussion that was like Midshipman Easy's\r\ntriangular duel multiplied by six.\r\n\r\n'There's no use talking, colonel, you never have done anything against\r\nus in a fair hand-to-hand fight, and you never can.'\r\n\r\n(_You_ on this occasion may be supposed to be cavalry, personified in a\r\nlong, lantern-jawed attorney from Iowa, while _us_ stands for infantry,\r\nrepresented by an ex-drover from Indiana.)\r\n\r\n'Never done anything, eh?' replies the attorney, who, on the strength of\r\na commission and mustache of at least six months' date, ranks as quite a\r\nveteran in the party; 'what did you do at Borodino? Pretty show you made\r\nthere when we came charging down upon you!'\r\n\r\n'Oh, that was all somebody's fault--what's his name's, you know, that\r\ncommanded there. Didn't find those charges work so well at Waterloo, did\r\nyou?' Thus the ex-drover, fresh from the perusal of Halleck on Military\r\nScience.\r\n\r\n'Ah, but you see they could not stand our grape and canister,'\r\ninterposes artillery (Major Phelim O. Malley, now of the 99th Peoria\r\nBattery, till last month real-estate and insurance broker, No.----\r\nDearborn street, basement).\r\n\r\n'If we ploy into a hollow square'--\r\n\r\n'Yes, but you see we come down obliquely and cut off your corners'--\r\n\r\n'All they want then is a couple of field pieces; zounds, sir!'--(the\r\nmajor has found this expletive in Lever's novels, and adopted it as\r\nparticularly becoming to a military man.)\r\n\r\n'Echelon--charge--right guides--Buny Visty--Austerlitz'--\r\n\r\nMeanwhile old Brazos and the Swiss major sit grimly silent, one nursing\r\nhis lame shin, where the Mexican bullet struck him, the other drawing\r\nhard on his pipe and puffing out wreaths of smoke that hang like\r\nLinden's 'sulphurous canopy' over the combatants. I have no doubt a\r\ngreat deal of excellent tactics was displayed in these discussions;\r\nstill less, if possible, that the zeal of the disputants was all the\r\nmore creditable to them for their peaceful antecedents during their\r\nwhole lives; but the ludicrous side of the scene was brought out all the\r\nmore strongly by the silence of these old soldiers, who alone out of the\r\nwhole party had ever seen what men actually could and did do on the\r\nbattle field.\r\n\r\nSometimes these conversations took a high range, and dwelt upon the\r\ncauses and the policy of the contest in which we were engaged. I do not\r\nthink, however, that these were half so much talked or thought of among\r\nthe officers as in the barracks of the men; and it is only justice to\r\nadd, that among a large class of the privates I have heard them\r\ndiscussed with a clearness, a freedom from all prejudices and present\r\ninterests, that surpassed the average deliberations of the shoulder\r\nstraps. There never probably was so large an army assembled in the world\r\nwhere so great a proportion of the intelligence could be found in the\r\nranks. Marked individual instances were constantly met with. There was\r\nat least one corporal in the ----th, who occupied his leisure hours with\r\nthe Greek Testament, that the time spent in fighting for his country\r\nmight not be all lost to his education for the ministry. I hope the\r\nnoble fellow will preach none the less acceptably without the arm that\r\nhe left at Donelson. Another of our non-commissioned officers was a\r\nmember of the Iowa Legislature. Could there be a happier illustration of\r\nthe fine compliment paid by President Lincoln in his message of last\r\nsummer to the rank and file of our army? Pity it must be added that no\r\nrepresentations could procure him a furlough to allow him to take his\r\nseat during the session. Had he been a colonel, with $3,000 a year, the\r\npath would have been wide and smooth that led from his duties in the\r\ncamp to his seat in Congress, or any other good place he was lucky\r\nenough to fill.\r\n\r\nThis, by the way, is only one instance of the greatest defect in our\r\nvolunteer system: the broad and almost impassable gulf of demarcation\r\nbetween commissioned officers and enlisted men. The character of the\r\narmy requires that this should be eradicated as soon as possible.\r\nEnthusiastic patriotism might make men willing to bear with it for a\r\ntime, or while the war seemed a temporary affair. But since the\r\nconviction has settled down upon the popular mind that we are in for a\r\nlong and tedious struggle, and that a great army of American citizens\r\nmust be kept on foot during the whole of it, overshadowing all peaceful\r\npursuits, and remoulding the whole character of our people, there begins\r\nto be felt also the need of organizing that army as far as possible in\r\nconformity with the genius of our people and Government. The greenest\r\nrecruit expects to find in the army a sharp distinction of rank, and a\r\nstrict obedience to authority, to which he has been a stranger in\r\npeaceful times. But he is disappointed and discouraged when he finds a\r\nneedless barrier erected to divide men into two classes, of which the\r\nsmallest retains to itself all the profits and privileges of the\r\nservice. He comprehends very well that a captain needs higher pay and\r\nmore liberty than a private, and a general than a captain; but he fails\r\nto see the reason why a second lieutenant should have four or five times\r\nthe pay of an orderly sergeant, and be officially recognized all through\r\nthe army regulations as a gentleman, while he who holds the much more\r\narduous and responsible office is simply an 'enlisted man,' It will be\r\nmuch easier for him to discover why this is so than to find any good\r\nreason why it should remain so. We are managing an army of half a\r\nmillion by the routine intended for one of ten thousand, and we are\r\norganizing citizen volunteers under regulations first created for the\r\nmost dissimilar army to be found in the civilized world. We adopted our\r\narmy system from England, where there are widely and perpetually\r\ndistinct classes of society in peace as well as war; the nobility and\r\ngentry furnishing all the officers, while the ranks are filled up with\r\nthe vast crowd, poor and ignorant enough to fight for sixpence a day. To\r\nour little standing army of bygone days the system was well enough\r\nadapted, for in that we too had really two distinct classes of men. West\r\nPoint furnished even more officers than we needed, with thorough\r\neducation, and the refined and expensive habits that education brings\r\nwith it. The ranks were filled with foreigners and broken-down men, who\r\nhad neither the ambition nor the ability to rise to anything higher. But\r\nwe have changed all that. The healthiest and best blood of our country\r\nis flowing in that country's cause. Our army is composed of more than\r\nhalf a million citizens, young, eager, ambitious, and trained from\r\ninfancy each to believe himself the equal of any man on earth. With the\r\nprivates under their command the officers have for the most part been\r\nplaymates, schoolmates, associates in business, all through life. A\r\ntrifle more of experience or of energy, or the merest accident sometimes\r\nhas made one captain, while the other has gone into the ranks; but\r\nunless those men were created over again, you could not make between\r\nthem the difference that the army regulations contemplate. Once off\r\nduty, there is nothing left to found it on.\r\n\r\n'I say, Jack,' said an officer at Pittsburg Landing to an old crony who\r\nwas serving as private in another company, 'where did you get that\r\nturkey?'\r\n\r\n'Well, cap, I want to know first whether you ask that question as an\r\nofficer or as a friend.'\r\n\r\n'As a friend, of course, Jack.'\r\n\r\n'Then it's none of your d---- business, Tom!'\r\n\r\nThe difference in pay is not only too great, but is made up in a way\r\nthat shows its want of reason. Both have lived on the same fare all\r\ntheir lives, and the captain knows that it is an absurdity for him to be\r\ndrawing the price of four rations a day on the supposition that he has\r\nbeen luxuriously trained, while in reality he satisfies his appetite\r\nwith the same plain dishes served out to his brother in the ranks. He\r\nknows that it is an absurdity for him to receive a large pay in order to\r\nsupport his family according to their supposed rank, while the private's\r\nwife and children are to be made comfortable out of thirteen dollars a\r\nmonth; the fact being that Mrs. Captain and Mrs. Private probably live\r\nnext door to each other at home, and exchange calls and groceries, and\r\nwear dresses from the same piece, and talk scandal about each other, all\r\nin as neighborly a manner as they have been accustomed to do all their\r\nlives. Indeed, whatever aristocracy of wealth and elegance was growing\r\nup among us has been set back at least a generation by this war, which\r\nhas brought out into such prominent notice and elevated so high in our\r\nhearts the rougher merits of the strong arm and the dextrous hand. Every\r\nmonth sees a larger proportion of officers coming from among those whose\r\nhabits have been the reverse of luxury. It is hard to say which would be\r\nmore mischievous and absurd: for these to spend their extra pay and\r\nrations in an effort to copy the traditional style of an English\r\nGuardsman, or to keep on in their old way of life, and pocket large\r\nsavings that are supposed to be thus spent.\r\n\r\nWe need therefore to root out entirely this division of the army into\r\ntwo classes. Let the scale of rank and pay rise by regular steps from\r\ncorporal to general, so that the former may be as much or as little a\r\n'commissioned officer' as his superiors. Abolish all invidious\r\ndistinctions by a regular system of promotions from the ranks, and only\r\nfrom the ranks, except so far as West Point and kindred schools furnish\r\nmen educated to commence active service at a higher round of the ladder.\r\nThen we shall have an army into which the best class of our youth can go\r\nas privates without feeling that they have more to dread in their own\r\ncamps than on the battle field.\r\n\r\nNo doubt there would be an outcry against such a change from those who\r\nhave been accustomed to the old system and enjoyed its benefits. This of\r\nitself would be no great obstacle, unless supported by a vague\r\nimpression among the people at large that there must be some good reason\r\nfor the present state of things, and that civilians had better not\r\nmeddle with it. I see them sinking down covered with confusion when some\r\nred-faced old 'regular' bursts out upon them with 'Stuff, sir! What do\r\n_you_ know about military matters?' The best answer to this is, that\r\nother nations, like the French, have set us the example, though by no\r\nmeans so well provided with intelligent material to draw from in the\r\nranks; and that in fact England and the United States are about the only\r\ncountries in which the evil is allowed to exist. In both of these it has\r\nremained from the fact that the body of the citizens have never been\r\ninterested in the rank and file of the army. In this country we have now\r\nan entirely new state of things to provide for; and Yankee ingenuity\r\nmust hide its head for shame if a very few years do not give us a\r\nrepublican army better organized and more efficient than any the world\r\nhas yet seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTAMMANY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  And at their meeting all with one accord\r\n    Cried: 'Down with LINCOLN and Fort Lafayette!'\r\n  But while jails stand and some men fear the LORD,\r\n    How _can_ ye tell what ye may chance to get?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN MEMORIAM.\r\n\r\n  In the dim and misty shade of the hazel thicket,\r\n    Three soldiers, brave Harry, and Tom with the dauntless eyes,\r\n  And light-hearted Charlie, are standing together on picket,\r\n    Keeping a faithful watch 'neath the starry skies.\r\n\r\n  Silent they stand there, while in the moonlight pale\r\n    Their rifle barrels and polished bayonets gleam;\r\n  Nought is heard but the owl's low, plaintive wail,\r\n    And the soft musical voice of the purling stream;\r\n\r\n  Save when in whispering tones they speak to each other\r\n    Of the dear ones at home in the Northland far away,\r\n  Each leaving with each a message for sister and mother,\r\n    If he shall fall in the fight that will come with the day.\r\n\r\n  Slowly and silently pass the hours of the night,\r\n    The east blushes red, and the stars fade one by one;\r\n  The sun has risen, and far away on the right\r\n    The booming artillery tells that the fight is begun.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  'Steady, boys, steady; now, forward! charge bayonet!'\r\n    Onward they sweep with a torrent's resistless might;\r\n  With the rebels' life-blood their glittering blades are wet,\r\n    And many a patriot falls in the desperate fight.\r\n\r\n  The battle is ended--the victory won--but where\r\n    Are Harry and Charlie, and Tom with the dauntless eyes,\r\n  Who went forth in the morn, so eager to do and to dare?--\r\n    Alas! pale and pulseless they lie 'neath the starry skies.\r\n\r\n  Together they stood 'mid the storm of leaden rain,\r\n    Together advanced and charged on the traitor knaves,\r\n  Together they fell on the battle's bloody plain,\r\n    To-morrow together they'll sleep in their lowly graves.\r\n\r\n  A father's voice fails as he reads the list of the dead,\r\n    And a mother's heart is crushed by the terrible blow;\r\n  Yet there's something of pride that gleams through the tears they shed,\r\n    Pride, e'en in their grief, that their boys fell facing the foe.\r\n\r\n  And though the trumpet of fame shall ne'er tell their story,\r\n    Nor towering monument mark the spot where they lie,\r\n  Yet round their memory lingers an undying glory:\r\n    They gave all they could to their country--they only could die.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA MERCHANT'S STORY.\r\n\r\n'All of which I saw, and part of which I was.'\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nI found Selma plunged in the deepest grief. The telegram which informed\r\nher of Preston's death was dated three days before (it had been sent to\r\nGoldsboro for transmission, the telegraph lines not then running to\r\nNewbern), and she could not possibly reach the plantation until after\r\nher father's burial; but she insisted on going at once. She would have\r\nhis body exhumed; she must take a last look at that face which had never\r\nbeamed on her but in love!\r\n\r\nFrank proposed to escort her, but she knew he could not well be spared\r\nfrom business at that season; and, with a bravery and self-reliance not\r\ncommon to her years and her sex, she determined to go alone.\r\n\r\nShortly after my arrival at the house, she retired to her room with\r\nKate, to make the final arrangements for the journey; and I seated\r\nmyself with David, Cragin, and Frank, in the little back parlor, which\r\nthe gray-haired old Quaker and his son-in-law had converted into a\r\nsmoking room.\r\n\r\nAs Cragin was lighting his cigar, I said to him:\r\n\r\n'Have you heard the news?'\r\n\r\n'What news?'\r\n\r\n'The dissolution of Russell, Rollins & Co.'\r\n\r\n'No; there's nothing so good stirring. But you'll hear it some two years\r\nhence.'\r\n\r\n'Read that;' and I handed him the paper which Hallet had signed.\r\n\r\n'What is it, father?' asked Frank, his face alive with interest.\r\n\r\n'Cragin will show it to you, if it ever gets through his hair. I reckon\r\nhe's learning to read.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I believe I _can't_ read. What the deuce does it mean?'\r\n\r\n'Just what it says--Frank is free.'\r\n\r\nThe young man glanced over the paper. His face expressed surprise, but\r\nhe said nothing.\r\n\r\n'Then you've heard how things have been going on?' asked Cragin.\r\n\r\n'No, not a word. I've _seen_ that Hallet was abusing the boy shamefully.\r\nI came on, wanting an excuse to break the copartnership.'\r\n\r\n'Do you know you've done me the greatest service in the world? I told\r\nHallet, the other day, that we couldn't pull together much longer. He\r\nrefused to let me off till our term is up; but I've got him now;' and he\r\nlaughed in boyish glee.\r\n\r\n'Of course, the paper releases you as well as Frank. It's a general\r\ndissolution.'\r\n\r\n'Of course it is. How did you manage to get it? Hallet must have been\r\ncrazy. He wasn't _John Hallet_, that's certain!'\r\n\r\n'The _genuine_ John, but a _little_ excited.'\r\n\r\n'He must have been. But I'm rid of him, thank the Lord! Come, what do\r\nyou say to Frank's going in with me? I'll pack him off to Europe at\r\nonce--he can secure most of the old business.'\r\n\r\n'_He_ must decide about that. He can come with me, if he likes. He'll\r\nnot go a begging, that's certain. He'll have thirty thousand to start\r\nwith.'\r\n\r\n'Thirty thousand!' exclaimed Frank. 'No, father, you can't do that; you\r\nneed every dollar you've got.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I do, and more too. But the money is yours, not mine. You shall\r\nhave it to-morrow.'\r\n\r\n'Mine! Where did it come from?'\r\n\r\n'From a relative of yours. But he's modest; he don't want to be known.'\r\n'But I _ought_ to know, I thought I had no relatives.'\r\n\r\n'Well, you haven't--only this one, and he's rich as mud. He gave you the\r\nfive thousand; but this is a last instalment--you won't get another red\r\ncent.'\r\n\r\n'I don't feel exactly like taking money in that way.'\r\n\r\n'Pshaw, my boy! I tell you it's yours--rightfully and honestly. You\r\nought to have more; but he's close-fisted, and you must be content with\r\nthis.'\r\n\r\n'Well, Frank,' said Cragin, 'what do you say to hitching horses with me?\r\nI'll give you two fifths, and put a hundred against your thirty.\r\n\r\n'What shall I do?' said Frank to me.\r\n\r\n'You'd better accept. It's more than I can allow you.'\r\n\r\n'Then it's a trade?' asked Cragin.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said Frank.\r\n\r\n'Well, old gentleman, what do _you_ say--will you move the old stool?'\r\nsaid Cragin, addressing David.\r\n\r\n'Yes; I like Frank too well to stay with even his father.'\r\n\r\nIn the gleeful mood which had taken possession of the old man, the words\r\nslipped from his tongue before he was aware of it. He would have\r\nrecalled them on the instant, but it was too late. Cragin caught them,\r\nand exclaimed:\r\n\r\n'His father! Well, that explains some riddles. D--d if I won't call the\r\nnew firm Hallet, Cragin & Co. I've got him all around--ha! ha!'\r\n\r\nFrank seemed thunderstruck. Soon he plied me with questions.\r\n\r\n'I can say nothing; I gave my word I would not. David has betrayed it;\r\nlet him explain, if he pleases.'\r\n\r\nThe old bookkeeper then told the young man his history, revealing\r\neverything but the degradation of his poor mother. Frank walked the\r\nroom, struggling with contending emotions. When David concluded, he put\r\nhis hand in mine, and spoke a few low words. His voice sounded like his\r\nmother's. It was again _her_ blessing that I heard.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo weeks afterward, the old sign came down from the old warehouse--came\r\ndown, after hanging there three quarters of a century, and in its place\r\nwent up a black board, on which, emblazoned in glaring gilt letters,\r\nwere the two words,\r\n\r\n\r\n        'JOHN HALLET.'\r\n\r\nOn the same day, the busy crowd passing up old Long Wharf might have\r\nseen, over a doorway not far distant, a plainer sign. It read:\r\n\r\n        'CRAGIN, MANDELL & Co.'\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nKate heard frequently from Selma within the first two months after her\r\ndeparture, but then her letters suddenly ceased. Her last one expressed\r\nthe intention of returning to the North during the following week. We\r\nlooked for her, but she did not come. Week after week went by, and still\r\nshe did not come. Kate wrote, inquiring when we might expect her, but\r\nreceived no reply. She wrote again and again, and still no answer came.\r\n'Something has happened to her. _Do_ write Mrs. Preston,' said Kate. I\r\nwrote her. She either did not deign to reply, or she did not receive the\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nNone of Selma's friends had heard from her for more than three months,\r\nand we were in a state of painful anxiety and uncertainty, when, one\r\nmorning, among my letters, I found one addressed to my wife, in Selma's\r\nhandwriting. Her previous letters had been mailed at Trenton, but this\r\nwas post-marked 'Newbern.' I sent it at once to my house. About an hour\r\nafterward I was surprised by Kate's appearance in the office. Her face\r\nwas pale, her manner hurried and excited. She held a small carpet bag in\r\nher hand.\r\n\r\n'You must start at once by the first train. You've not a moment to\r\nspare!'\r\n\r\n'Start where?'\r\n\r\nShe handed me the letter. 'Read that.'\r\n\r\nIt was hurriedly and nervously written. I read:\r\n\r\n     'MY DEAREST FRIEND: I know _you_ have not forsaken me, but\r\n     I have written you, oh! so many times. To-day, Ally has told me\r\n     that perhaps our letters are intercepted at the Trenton post\r\n     office. It must be so. He takes this to Newbern. Is he not kind? He\r\n     has been my faithful friend through all. Though ordered away from\r\n     the plantation, he refused to go, and stood by me through the\r\n     worst. He whom my own sister so cruelly wronged, has done\r\n     everything for me! Whatever may become of me, I shall ever bless\r\n     him.\r\n\r\n     'I have not heard from or seen any of my friends. Even my brother\r\n     has not answered my letters; but he must be here, on the 17th, at\r\n     the sale. That is now my only hope. I shall then be freed from this\r\n     misery--worse than death. God bless you!\r\n                                                 Your wretched SELMA.'\r\n\r\n'I will go,' was all that I said. Kate sat down, and wept 'Oh! some\r\nterrible thing has befallen her! What can it be?'\r\n\r\nI was giving some hurried directions to my partners, when a telegram was\r\nhanded in. It was from Boston, and addressed to me personally. I opened\r\nit, and read:\r\n\r\n     'I have just heard that Selma is a slave. To be sold on the\r\n     seventeenth. I can't go. You must. Buy her on my account. Pay any\r\n     price. I have written Frank. Let nothing prevent your starting at\r\n     once. If your partners should be short while you're away, let them\r\n     draw on me.\r\n                                                    'AUGUSTUS CRAGIN.'\r\n\r\nIt was then the morning of the twelfth. Making all the connections, and\r\nthere being no delay of the trains, I should reach the plantation early\r\non the seventeenth.\r\n\r\nAt twelve o'clock I was on the way. Steam was too slow for my\r\nimpatience. I would have harnessed the lightning.\r\n\r\nAt last--it was sundown of the sixteenth--the stage drove into Newbern.\r\n\r\nWith my carpet bag in my hand, I rushed into the hotel. Four or five\r\nloungers were in the office, and the lazy bartender was mixing drinks\r\nbehind the counter.\r\n\r\n'Sir, I want a horse, or a horse and buggy, at once.'\r\n\r\n'A horse? Ye're in a hurry, hain't ye?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'Wall, I reckon ye'll hev ter git over it. Thar hain't a durned critter\r\nin th' whole place.'\r\n\r\n'I'm in no mood for jesting, sir. I want a horse _at once_. I will\r\ndeposit twice his value.'\r\n\r\n'Ye couldn't git nary critter, stranger, ef ye wus made uv gold. They're\r\nall off--off ter Squire Preston's sale.'\r\n\r\n'The sale! Has it begun?'\r\n\r\n'I reckon! Ben a gwine fur two days.'\r\n\r\nMy heart sank within me. I was too late!\r\n\r\n'Are all the negroes sold?'\r\n\r\n'No; them comes on ter morrer. He's got a likely gang.'\r\n\r\nI breathed more freely. At this moment a well-dressed gentleman,\r\nfollowed by a good-looking yellow man, entered the room. He wore spurs,\r\nand was covered with dust. Approaching the counter, he said:\r\n\r\n'Here, you lazy devil--a drink for me and my boy. I'm drier than a\r\nparson--Old Bourbon.'\r\n\r\nAs the bartender poured out the liquor, the new comer's eye fell upon\r\nme. His face seemed familiar, but I could not recall it. Scanning me for\r\na moment, he held out his hand in a free, cordial manner, saying:\r\n\r\n'Ah! Mr. Kirke, is this you? You don't remember me? my name is Gaston.'\r\n\r\n'Mr. Gaston, I'm glad to see you,' I replied, returning his salutation.\r\n\r\n'Have a drink, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Thank you.' I emptied the glass. I was jaded, and had eaten nothing\r\nsince morning. 'I'm in pursuit of a horse under difficulties, Mr.\r\nGaston. Perhaps you can tell me where to get one. I must be at Preston's\r\nto-night.'\r\n\r\n'They're scarcer than hen's teeth round here, just now, I reckon. But\r\nhold on; I go there in the morning. I'll borrow a buggy, and you can\r\nride up with me.'\r\n\r\n'No, I must be there to-night. How far is it?'\r\n\r\n'Twenty miles.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I'll walk. Landlord, give me supper at once.'\r\n\r\n'_Walk_ there! My dear sir, we don't abuse strangers in these diggin's.\r\nThe road is sandier than an Arab desert. You'd never get there afoot.\r\nTom,' he added, calling to his man, 'give Buster some oats; rub him\r\ndown, and have him here in half an hour. Travel, now, like greased\r\nlightning.' Then turning to me, he continued: 'You can have _my_ horse.\r\nHe's a spirited fellow, and you'll need to keep an eye on him; but he'll\r\nget you there in two hours.'\r\n\r\n'But how will _you_ get on?'\r\n\r\n'I'll take my boy's, and leave the darky here.'\r\n\r\n'Mr. Gaston, I cannot tell you the service you are doing me.'\r\n\r\n'Don't speak of it, my dear sir. A stranger can have anything of mine\r\nbut my wife;' and he laughed pleasantly.\r\n\r\nHe went with me into the supper room, and there told me that the sale of\r\nPreston's plantation, furniture, live stock, farm tools, &c., had\r\noccupied the two previous days; and that the negroes were to be put on\r\nthe block at nine o'clock the next morning. 'I've got my eye on one or\r\ntwo of them, that I mean to buy. The niggers will sell well, I reckon.'\r\n\r\nAfter supper, we strolled again into the bar room. Approaching the\r\ncounter, my eye fell on the hotel register, which lay open upon it. I\r\nglanced involuntarily over the book. Among the arrivals of the previous\r\nday, I noticed two recorded in a hand that I at once recognized. The\r\nnames were, 'JOHN HALLET, _New Orleans_; JACOB LARKIN, _ditto_.'\r\n\r\n'Are these gentlemen here?' I asked the bartender.\r\n\r\n'No; they left same day the' come.'\r\n\r\n'Where did they go?'\r\n\r\n'Doan't know.'\r\n\r\nIn five minutes, with my carpet bag strapped to the pommel of the\r\nsaddle, I was bounding up the road to Trenton.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly ten o'clock when I sprang from the horse and rang the bell\r\nat the mansion. A light was burning in the library, but the rest of the\r\nhouse was dark. A negro opened the door.\r\n\r\n'Where is master Joe, or Miss Selly?'\r\n\r\n'In de library, massa. I'll tell dem you'm here.'\r\n\r\n'No; I'll go myself. Look after my horse.'\r\n\r\nI strode through the parlors and the passage way to the old room. Selma\r\nwas seated on a lounge by the side of Joe, her head on his shoulder. As\r\nI opened the door, I spoke the two words: 'My child!'\r\n\r\nShe looked up, sprang to her feet, and rushed into my arms.\r\n\r\n'And you are safe!' I cried, putting back her soft brown hair, and\r\nkissing her pale, beautiful forehead.\r\n\r\n'Yes, I am safe. My brother is here--I am _safe_.'\r\n\r\n'Joe--God bless you!--you're a noble fellow!'\r\n\r\nHe was only twenty-three, but his face was already seamed and haggard,\r\nand his hair thickly streaked with white! We sat down, and from Selma's\r\nlips I learned the events of the preceding months.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nSelma arrived at home about a week after her father's funeral. The\r\naffairs of the plantation were going on much as usual, but Mrs. Preston\r\nwas there in apparently the greatest grief. She seemed inconsolable;\r\ntalked much of her loss, and expressed great fears for the future. Her\r\nhusband had left no will, and nothing would remain for her but the dower\r\nin the real estate, and that would sell for but little.\r\n\r\nThe more Preston's affairs were investigated, the worse they appeared.\r\nHe was in debt everywhere. An administrator was appointed, and he\r\ndecided that a sale of everything--the two plantations and the\r\nnegroes--would be necessary.\r\n\r\nSelma felt little interest in the pecuniary result, but sympathy for her\r\nstepmother induced her to remain at home, week after week, when her\r\npresence there was no longer of service. At last she made preparations\r\nto return; but, as she was on the point of departure, Mrs.\r\nPreston--whose face then wore an expression of triumphant malignity\r\nwhich chilled Selma's very life-blood--told her that she could not go;\r\nthat she was a part of her father's estate, and must remain, and be sold\r\nwith the other negroes!\r\n\r\nDawsey, shortly prior to this, had become a frequent visitor at the\r\nplantation; and, the week before, Phylly had been dreadfully whipped\r\nunder his supervision. Selma interceded for her, but could not avert the\r\npunishment. She did not at the time know why it was done, but at last\r\nthe reason was revealed to her.\r\n\r\nAmong the papers of the first Mrs. Preston, the second wife had found a\r\nbill of sale, by which, in consideration of one gold watch, two diamond\r\nrings, an emerald pin, two gold bracelets, some family plate, and other\r\njewelry, of the total value of five hundred dollars, General ----, of\r\nNewbern, had conveyed a negro girl called 'Lucy', to Mrs. Lucy Preston,\r\nwife of Robert Preston, Esq. Said girl was described as seven years old,\r\nlight complexioned, with long, curly hair, of a golden brown; and the\r\nchild of Phyllis, otherwise called Phyllis Preston, then the property of\r\nJacob Larkin.\r\n\r\nMrs. Preston inquired of Phyllis what had become of the child. The nurse\r\ndenied all knowledge of it; but Selma's age, her peculiar hair, and her\r\nstrong resemblance to Rosey, excited the Yankee woman's suspicions, and\r\nshe questioned the mother more closely. Phyllis still denied all\r\nknowledge of her child, and, for that denial, was whipped--whipped till\r\nher flesh was cut into shreds, and she fainted from loss of blood. After\r\nthe whipping, she was left in an old cabin, to live or die--her mistress\r\ndid not care which; and there Ally found her at night, on his return\r\nfrom his work in the swamp. Wrapping her mangled body in an oiled sheet,\r\nhe conveyed her to his cabin. Dinah carefully nursed her, and ere long\r\nshe was able to sit up. Then Mrs. Preston told her that, as soon as she\r\nwas sufficiently recovered to live through it, she would be again and\r\nagain beaten, till she disclosed the fate of the child.\r\n\r\nShe still denied all knowledge of it; but, fearing the rage of her\r\nmistress, she sent for her husband, then keeping a small groggery at\r\nTrenton, four miles away. He came and had a conference with Ally and\r\nDinah about the best way of saving his wife from further abuse. Phyllis\r\nwas unable to walk or to ride, therefore flight was out of the question.\r\nAlly proposed that Mulock should oversee his gang for a time while he\r\nremained about home and kept watch over her. None of the negroes could\r\nbe induced to whip her in his presence; and if Dawsey or any other white\r\nman attempted it, he was free--he would meet them with their own\r\nweapons. Mulock agreed to this, and the next day went to the swamp.\r\n\r\nLearning of his presence on the plantation, the mistress sent for him,\r\nand, by means of a paltry bribe, induced him to reveal all! Selma\r\nthought he loved Phyllis as much as his brutal nature was capable of\r\nloving, and that he betrayed her to save her mother from further ill\r\nusage.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, four strong men entered Ally's cabin before he had\r\nleft his bed, bound him hand and foot, and dragged Phyllis away, to be\r\nagain whipped for having refused to betray Selma. Unable to stand, she\r\nwas tied to a stake, and unmercifully beaten. Weak from the effects of\r\nthe previous whipping, and crushed in spirit by anxiety for her child,\r\nnature could no longer sustain her. A fever set in, and, at the end of a\r\nweek, she died.\r\n\r\nSelma was told of their relation to each other. The nurse, so devotedly\r\nattached to her, and whom she had so long loved, was her own mother! She\r\nlearned this only in time to see her die, and to hear her last blessing.\r\n\r\nThen Selma experienced all the bitterness of slavery. She was set at\r\nwork in the kitchen with the other slaves. It seemed that Mrs. Preston\r\ntook especial delight in assigning to the naturally high-spirited and\r\nsensitive girl the most menial employments. Patiently trusting in God\r\nthat He would send deliverance, she endeavored to perform,\r\nuncomplainingly, her allotted tasks. Wholly unaccustomed to such work,\r\nweary in body and sick at heart, she dragged herself about from day to\r\nday, till at last Mrs. Preston, disgusted with her 'laziness,' as she\r\ntermed it, directed her to be taken to the quarters and beaten with\r\nfifty lashes!\r\n\r\nAlly had been ordered away by the mistress, and that morning had gone to\r\nTrenton to consult the administrator, and get his permission to stay on\r\nthe plantation. That gentleman--a kind-hearted, upright man--not only\r\ntold him he could remain, but gave him a written order to take and keep\r\nSelma in his custody.\r\n\r\nHe returned at night, to find she had been whipped. His blood boiling\r\nwith rage, he entered the mansion, and demanded to see her. Mrs. Preston\r\ndeclined. He then gave her the order of the administrator. She tore it\r\ninto fragments, and bade him leave the house. He refused to go without\r\nSelma, and quietly seated himself on the sofa. Mrs. Preston then called\r\nin ten or twelve of the field hands, and told them to eject him. They\r\neither would not or dared not do it; and, without more delay, he\r\nproceeded to search for Selma. At last he found her apartment. He burst\r\nopen the door, and saw her lying on a low, miserable bed, writhing in\r\nagony from her wounds. Throwing a blanket over her, he lifted her in his\r\narms, and carried her to his cabin. Dinah carefully attended her, and\r\nthat night she thanked God, and--slept.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, before the sun was fully up, Dawsey and three other\r\nwhite men, heavily armed, came to the cabin, and demanded admittance.\r\nAlly refused, and barricaded the door. They finally stealthily effected\r\nan entrance through a window in the kitchen, and, breaking down the\r\ncommunication with the 'living room,' in which apartment the mulatto man\r\nand his mother were, they rushed in upon them. Ally, the previous day,\r\nhad procured a couple of revolvers at Trenton, and Dinah and he,\r\nplanting themselves before the door of old Deborah's room, in which\r\nSelma was sleeping, pointed the weapons at the intruders. The assailants\r\npaused, when Dawsey shouted out: 'Are you afraid of two d--d\r\nniggers--and one a woman!' Aiming his pistol at Ally, he fired. The ball\r\nstruck the negro's left arm. Discharging two or three barrels at them,\r\nthe old woman and her son then rushed upon the white men, and they FLED!\r\nall but one--he remained; for Dinah caught him in a loving embrace, and\r\npummelled him until he might have been mistaken for calves-foot jelly.\r\n\r\nAlly then sent a messenger to the administrator, who rode over in the\r\nafternoon, and took Selma to his own house. There she remained till her\r\nbrother reached the plantation--three days before my arrival.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she was safely at Trenton, Selma wrote to her friends,\r\nmailing the letters at that post office. She received no answers. Again\r\nand again she wrote; the administrator also wrote, but still no replies\r\ncame. At last Ally suggested mailing the letters at Newbern, and rode\r\ndown with one to Joe, one to Alice, and one to Kate.\r\n\r\nHer brother came on at once. In the first ebullition of his anger he\r\nejected his stepmother from the mansion. She went to Dawsey's, and, the\r\nnext day, appeared at the sale with that gentleman; and then announced\r\nthat for two months she had been the woman-whipper's wife.\r\n\r\nDawsey had bought the plantation, and most of the furniture, the day\r\nbefore, and had said he intended to buy all of the 'prime' negroes.\r\n\r\nAs Selma concluded, Joe quietly remarked:\r\n\r\n'He'll be disappointed in that. I allowed him the plantation and\r\nfurniture, because I've no use for them; but I made him pay more than\r\nthey are worth. The avails will help me through with father's debts; but\r\nnot a single hand shall go into his clutches, I shall buy them myself.'\r\n\r\n'What will you do with them?'\r\n\r\n'I have bought a plantation near Mobile. I shall put them upon it. Joe\r\nwill manage them, and I'll live there with Selly.'\r\n\r\n'You're a splendid fellow, Joe. But it seems a pity that woman should\r\nprofane your father's house.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! there's no danger of that. I've engaged 'furnished apartments' for\r\nher elsewhere.'\r\n\r\n'What do you mean?'\r\n\r\n'The sheriff is asleep up stairs. He has a warrant against her for the\r\nmurder of Phyllis. When she comes here in the morning, it will be\r\nserved!'\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I rose early, and strolled out to the negro quarters.\r\nAt the distance of about a hundred yards from the mansion, the sun was\r\ntouching the tops of about thirty canvas camps, and, near them, large\r\nnumbers of horses, 'all saddled and bridled,' were picketed among the\r\ntrees. Some dozens of 'natives' were littered around, asleep on the\r\nground; and here and there a barelegged, barefooted woman was lying\r\nbeside a man on a 'spring' mattress, of the kind that is supposed to\r\nhave been patented in Paradise.\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful morning in May, and one would have thought, from the\r\nappearance of the motley collection, that the whole people had 'come up\r\nto worship the Lord in their tents,' after the manner of the Israelites.\r\nThe rich planter, the small farmer, the 'white trash'--all classes, had\r\ngathered to the negro sale, like crows to a feast of carrion.\r\n\r\nA few half-awake, half-sober, russet-clad, bewhiskered 'gentry' were\r\nlighting fires under huge iron pots; but the larger portion of the\r\n'congregation' was still wrapped in slumber.\r\n\r\nPassing them, I knocked at the door of Ally's cabin. The family was\r\nalready astir, and the various members gave me a greeting that cannot be\r\n_bought_ now anywhere with a handful of 'greenbacks.' Boss Joe, Aggy,\r\nand old Deborah had arrived, and were quartered with Ally.\r\n\r\n'An' 'ou wusn't a gwine ter leff massa Preston's own chile be sole\r\nwidout bein' yere; wus 'ou, massa Kirke?' cried Dinah, her face beaming\r\nall over with pleasurable emotion.\r\n\r\n'No, Dinah; and I've come here so early to tell you how much I think of\r\n_you_. A woman that can handle four white men as you did is fit to head\r\nan army.'\r\n\r\n'Lor' bress 'ou, massa! dat wusn't nuffin'. I could handle a whole\r\nmeetin'-house full ob sech as dem.'\r\n\r\n'Joe, you know your master's plans, I suppose?'\r\n\r\n'Yas, massa Kirke; he mean ter buy all de folks.'\r\n\r\n'But can he raise money enough for the whole?'\r\n\r\n'I reckon so. Massa Joe got a heap.'\r\n\r\n'But don't you want to borrow some to help out your pile?'\r\n\r\n'I'se 'bliged ter you, sar; but I reckon I doan't. I'se got nigh on ter\r\nfree thousan', an' nary one'll pay more'n dat fur a ole man an' two ole\r\nwimmin.'\r\n\r\n'I hope not.'\r\n\r\nI remained there for a half hour, and then strolled back to the mansion.\r\nOn the lawn, at the side of the house, was the auction block--the\r\ncarpenter's bench which had officiated at Ally's wedding. It was\r\napproached by a flight of steps, and at one end was the salesman's\r\nstand--a high stool, in front of which was a small portable desk\r\nsupported on stakes driven into the ground. Near the block was a booth\r\nfitted up for the special accommodation of thirsty buyers. The\r\nproprietor was just opening his own and his establishment's windows, and\r\nI looked in upon him. His red, bloated visage seemed familiar to me.\r\nPerceiving me, he said:\r\n\r\n'How is ye, stranger? Hev a eye-opener?'\r\n\r\n'I reckon not, old fellow; but I ought to know you. Your name is Tom.'\r\n\r\n'Thomas, stranger; but Tom, fur short.'\r\n\r\n'Well, Thomas, I thought you had taken your last drink. I saw your store\r\nwas closed, as I came along.'\r\n\r\n'Yas; th' durned 'ristocrats driv me out uv thet nigh a yar ago.'\r\n\r\n'And where are you now?'\r\n\r\n'Up ter Trenton. I'm doin' right smart thar. Me an' Mulock--thet used\r\nter b'long yere--is in partenship. But war moight ye hev seed me,\r\nstranger?'\r\n\r\n'At your store, over ten years since. I bought a woman there. You were\r\nhaving a turkey match at the time.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, yas! I 'call ye now. An' th' pore gal's dead! Thet d--d Yankee\r\n'ooman shud pull hemp fur thet.'\r\n\r\n'Yes; but the devil seldom gets his due in this world.'\r\n\r\n'Thet ar's a fact, stranger. Come, hev a drink; I woan't ax ye a red.'\r\n\r\n'No, excuse me, Tom; it's before breakfast;' and, walking off, I entered\r\nthe mansion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShortly after breakfast the people from the neighboring plantations\r\nbegan to gather to the sale, and, by the hour appointed for it to\r\ncommence, about five hundred men and women had collected on the ground.\r\nSome were on horseback, some in carriages, but the majority were seated\r\non the grass, or on benches improvised for the occasion.\r\n\r\nA few minutes before the 'exercises' commenced, the negroes were marched\r\nupon the lawn. No seats had been provided for them, and they huddled\r\ntogether inside a small area staked off for their reception. They were\r\nof all colors and ages. Husbands and wives, parents and children,\r\ngrandparents and grandchildren, aunts, uncles, and cousins, gathered in\r\nlittle family groups, and breathlessly awaited the stroke of the hammer\r\nwhich was to decide their destiny. They were all clad in their Sunday\r\nclothes, and looked clean and tidy; but on every face except Joe's was\r\ndepicted an ill-defined feeling of dread and consternation. Husbands\r\nheld their wives in their arms, and mothers hugged their children to\r\ntheir bosoms, as if they might soon part forever; but when old Joe\r\npassed among them, saying a low word to this one and the other, their\r\ncloudy visages brightened, and a heavy load seemed to roll off their\r\nhearts. Joe was as radiant as a summer morning, and walked about with a\r\nquiet dignity and unconcern that might have led one to think him the\r\nowner of the entire 'invoice of chattels.'\r\n\r\nAs the auctioneer--a spruce importation from Newbern--mounted the bench,\r\na splendid carriage, drawn by two magnificent grays, and driven by a\r\ndarky in livery, made its way through the crowd, and drew up opposite\r\nthe stand. In it were Dawsey and his wife!\r\n\r\nThe salesman's hammer came down. 'Gentlemen and ladies,' he said, 'the\r\nsale has commenced. I am about to offer you one hundred and sixty-one\r\nlikely negro men and women, belonging to the estate of Robert Preston,\r\nEsq., deceased. Each one will be particularly described when put up, and\r\nall will be warranted as represented. They will be sold in families;\r\nthat is, husbands and wives, and parents and young children, will not be\r\nseparated. The terms are, one quarter cash, the balance in one year,\r\nsecured by an approved indorsed note. Persons having claims against the\r\nestate will be allowed to pay by authenticated accounts and duebills.\r\nThe first lot I shall offer you will be the mulatto man Joe and his wife\r\nAgnes. Joe is known through all this region as a negro of uncommon worth\r\nand intelligence. He is'--\r\n\r\nHere he was interrupted by Dawsey, who exclaimed, in a hurried manner:\r\n\r\n'I came here expecting this sale would be conducted according to\r\ncustom--that each hand would be put up separately. I protest against\r\nthis innovation, Mr. Auctioneer.'\r\n\r\nThe auctioneer made no reply; but the administrator, a small,\r\nself-possessed man, mounted the bench, and said:\r\n\r\n'Sir, _I_ regulate this sale. If you are not satisfied with its\r\nconditions, you are not obliged to bid.'\r\n\r\nDawsey made a passionate reply. In the midst of it, Joe sprang upon the\r\nstand, and, in a clear, determined voice, called out:\r\n\r\n'Mr. Sheriff, do your duty.'\r\n\r\nA large, powerful man, in blue coat and brass buttons, stepped to the\r\nside of the carriage, and coolly opening the door, said:\r\n\r\n'Catharine Dawsey, you are charged with aiding and abetting in the\r\nmurder of Phyllis Preston. I arrest you. Please come with me.'\r\n\r\n'By ----, sir!' cried Dawsey; 'this lady is my wife!'\r\n\r\n'It makes no difference whose wife she is, sir. She is my prisoner.'\r\n\r\n'She must not be touched by you, or any other man!' yelled Dawsey,\r\ndrawing his pistol. Before he could fire, he rolled on the ground,\r\ninsensible. The sheriff had struck him a quick blow on the head with a\r\nheavy cane.\r\n\r\nAs her husband fell, Mrs. Dawsey sprang upon the driver's seat, and,\r\nseizing the reins from the astonished negro, applied the lash to the\r\nhorses. They reared and started. The panic-stricken crowd parted, like\r\nwaves in a storm, and the spirited animals bounded swiftly down the\r\navenue. They had nearly reached the cluster of liveoaks which borders\r\nthe small lake, when a man sprang at their heads. He missed them, fell,\r\nand the carriage passed over him; but the horses shied from the road\r\ninto the trees, and in an instant the splendid vehicle was a mass of\r\nfragments, and Mrs. Dawsey and the negro were sprawling on the ground.\r\n\r\nThe lady was taken up senseless, and badly hurt, but breathing. The\r\ndriver was dead!\r\n\r\nThe crowd hurried across the green to the scene of disaster. Joe and I\r\nreached the man in the road at the same instant. It was Ally! We took\r\nhim up, bore him to the edge of the pond, and bathed his forehead with\r\nwater. In a few minutes he opened his eyes.\r\n\r\n'Are you much hurt, Ally?' asked Joe, with almost breathless eagerness.\r\n\r\n'I reckon not, massa Joe,' said Ally; 'my head, yere, am sore, an' dis\r\nankle p'raps am broke. Leff me see;' and he rose to his feet, and tried\r\nhis leg. 'No, massa Joe; it'm sound's a pine knot. I hain't done fur\r\n_dis_ time.'\r\n\r\n'Thank God!' exclaimed Joe, with an indescribable expression of relief.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dawsey was borne to the mansion, the negro carried off to the\r\nquarters, and, in a few moments, the crowd once more gathered around the\r\nauctioneer's stand. Dawsey, by this time recovered from the sheriff's\r\nblow, was cursing and swearing terribly over the disaster of his wife\r\nand--his property.\r\n\r\n'Twenty-five hundred dollars gone at a blow! D--n the woman; didn't she\r\nknow better than that?'\r\n\r\nAs he followed his wife into the house, the sheriff said to the\r\nadministrator, who was a justice of the peace:\r\n\r\n'Make me out a warrant for that man--obstructing the execution of the\r\nlaw.'\r\n\r\nThe warrant was soon made out, and in fifteen minutes, Dawsey, raving\r\nlike a wild animal, was driven off to jail at Trenton. Mrs. Dawsey, too\r\nmuch injured to be removed, was left under guard at the mansion, and the\r\nsale proceeded.\r\n\r\nBoss Joe and Aggy ascended the block, and 'Master Joe' took a stand\r\nbeside them.\r\n\r\n'How much is said for these prime negroes?' cried the auctioneer.\r\nEverybody knows what they are, and there's no use preaching a sermon\r\nover them. Boss Joe might do that, but _I_ can't. He can preach equal to\r\nany white man you ever hard. Come, gentlemen, start a bid. How much do\r\nyou say?'\r\n\r\n'A thousand,' said a voice in the crowd.\r\n\r\n'Eleven hundred,' cried another.\r\n\r\n'It's a d--d shame to bid on them, gentlemen. Boss Joe has been saving\r\nmoney to buy himself; and I think no white man should bid against him,'\r\ncried a man at my elbow.\r\n\r\nIt was Gaston, who had just arrived on the ground.\r\n\r\n'Thet's a fact.' 'Them's my sentiments.' 'D--n th' man thet'll bid agin\r\na nigger.' 'Thet's so, Gaston,' echoed from all directions.\r\n\r\n'But I yere th' darky's got a pile--some two thousan'; _thet_ gwoes\r\n'long with him, uv course,' yelled one of the crowd.\r\n\r\n'Of course it don't!' said young Joe, from the stand. 'He's saved about\r\nthree thousand out of a commission his master allowed him; but he _gave_\r\nthat _to me_, long before my father died. It is _mine_--not _his_. I bid\r\ntwelve hundred for him and his wife; and I will say to the audience,\r\nthat I shall advance on whatever sum may be offered for them. So fire\r\naway, gentlemen; I ask no favors.'\r\n\r\n'Is there any more bid for this excellent couple?' cried the auctioneer.\r\n'It is my duty to cry them, and to tell you they're worth twice that\r\nmoney.'\r\n\r\nThere was no more bid, and Boss Joe and Aggy were struck down at twelve\r\nhundred dollars--about two thirds their market value.\r\n\r\n'Now, gentlemen, we will offer you the old negress, Deborah, the mother\r\nof Joe. Bring her forward!' cried the man of the hammer.\r\n\r\nFour strong negroes lifted the chair of the aged African, and bore her\r\nto the block. When the strange vehicle reached the steps, young Preston\r\nsteadied it into its appropriate position, and then took a stand beside\r\nit.\r\n\r\n'This aged lady, gentlemen, is warranted over eighty; she may be a\r\nhundred. She can't walk, but she can pray and sing to kill. How much is\r\nbid for all this piety done up in black crape?' cried the auctioneer,\r\nsmiling complacently, as if conscious of saying a witty thing.\r\n\r\nJoe turned on him quickly. 'Sir, you are employed to _sell_ these\r\npeople, not to sport with their feelings. Let me hear no more of this.'\r\n\r\n'No offence, Mr. Preston. Gentlemen, how much is bid for old Deborah?'\r\n\r\n'Five dollars,' said young Preston.\r\n\r\nThe old negress, who sat nearly double, straightened up her bent form,\r\nand, looking at Joe with a sad, pleading expression, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n'Oh, massa Joe! ole nussy'm wuth more'n dat. 'Ou woan't leff har be sole\r\nfur no sech money as dat, will 'ou, massa Joe?'\r\n\r\n'No aunty; not if you want to bring more. I'd give your weight in gold\r\nfor you;' and, turning to the auctioneer, he said: 'A hundred dollars is\r\nmy bid, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Bress 'ou, massa Joe! bress 'ou! 'Ou'm my own dear, bressed chile!'\r\nexclaimed the old negress, clutching at his hand, and, with a sudden\r\neffort, rising to her feet. She stood thus for a moment, then she\r\nstaggered back, fell into her chair, uttered a low moan, and--was FREE!\r\n\r\nA wild excitement followed, during which the body was borne off. It was\r\na full half hour before quiet was restored and the sale resumed. Then\r\nabout twenty negroes, of both sexes, were put up singly. All of them\r\nwere bought by Joe, except a young woman, whose husband belonged to\r\nGaston. The bidding on her was spirited, and she was run up to ten\r\nhundred and fifty dollars. As Gaston bid that sum, he jumped upon a\r\nbench, and called out:\r\n\r\n'Gentlemen, I can stand this as long as you can. I mean to have this\r\nwoman, anyhow.'\r\n\r\nNo one offered more, and 'the lot' was struck off to Gaston. Joe did not\r\nbid on her at all.\r\n\r\nWhen the next negro ascended the stand, Joe beckoned to me, and said:\r\n\r\n'Selly is next on the catalogue. Will you bring her here?'\r\n\r\nAs I entered the mansion, she met me. Her face was pale, and there was a\r\nnervous twitching about her mouth, but she quietly said:\r\n\r\n'You have come for me?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, my child. Have courage; it will soon be over.'\r\n\r\nShe laid her head upon my shoulder for a moment; then, turning her\r\nlarge, clear, but tearless eyes up to mine, she said:\r\n\r\n'I trust in GOD!'\r\n\r\nI took her arm in mine, and walked out to the stand. The auctioneer was\r\nwaiting for her, and we ascended the block together. A slight tremor\r\npassed over her frame as she met the sea of upturned faces, all eagerly\r\ngazing at her; and, putting my arm about her, I whispered:\r\n\r\n'Do not fear. Lean on me.'\r\n\r\n'I do not fear,' was the low reply.\r\n\r\n'Now, gentlemen,' cried the auctioneer, in an unfeeling, business-like\r\nway, 'I offer you the girl, Lucy Selma. She is seventeen years old; in\r\ngood health; well brought up--a superior lot every way. She has recently\r\nbeen employed at cooking, but, as you see, is better adapted to lighter\r\nwork. How much shall I have for her? Come, bid fast gentlemen; we are\r\ntaking up too much time.'\r\n\r\nBefore any response could be made to this appeal, Joe stepped to the\r\nside of Selma, and, in a slow, deliberate voice, said:\r\n\r\n'Gentlemen, allow me a few words. This young lady is my sister. I have\r\nalways supposed--she has always supposed that she was the legitimate\r\nchild of my father. She was not. My mother bought her when she was very\r\nyoung; gave her jewels--all she had--for her, and adopted her as her own\r\nchild. The law does not allow a married woman to hold separate property,\r\nand Selma is therefore inventoried in my father's estate, and must be\r\nsold. Rightfully she belongs to me! She has been delicately and tenderly\r\nreared, and is totally unfitted for any of the usual work of slave\r\nwomen. Her value for such purposes is very little. I shall bid a\r\nthousand dollars for her, which is more than she is worth for any honest\r\nuse. If any man bids more, it is HIS LIFE OR MINE _before he leaves the\r\nground!_'\r\n\r\nA breathless silence fell on the assemblage. It lasted for a few\r\nmoments, when Gaston called out:\r\n\r\n'Come, Joe, this isn't fair. You've no right to interfere with the sale.\r\nI came here prepared to go twenty-five hundred for her myself.'\r\n\r\nIn a firm but moderate tone, the young man replied:\r\n\r\n'I intend no disrespect to you, Mr. Gaston, or to any gentleman\r\npresent; but I mean what I say. I shall stand by my words!'\r\n\r\n'Come, youngster, none uv yer brow-beatin' yere. It woan't gwo down,'\r\ncried a rough voice from among the audience. 'I've come all th' way from\r\nOrleans ter buy thet gal; an' buy har I shill!'\r\n\r\nQuite a commotion followed this speech. It lasted some minutes, and the\r\nspeaker was the object of considerable attention.\r\n\r\n'He's some on th' trigger, ole feller,' cried one. 'He kin hit a\r\nturkey's eye at two hundred paces, he kin,' said another. 'He'll burn\r\nyer in'ards, shore,' shouted a third. 'Ye'll speak fur warm lodgin's, ef\r\nye bid on thet gal, ye wull,' cried a fourth.\r\n\r\n'Come, my friends, ye karn't skeer me,' coolly said the first speaker,\r\nmounting one of the rough benches. 'I've h'ard sech talk afore. It\r\ndoan't turn _me_ a hair. I come yere ter buy thet gal, an' buy har I\r\nshill, 'cept some on ye kin gwo higher'n my pile; an' my pile ar\r\n_eighty-two hundred dollars_!'\r\n\r\nHe was a tall, stoutly-built man, with bushy gray whiskers and a clear,\r\nresolute eye. It was Larkin!\r\n\r\nTurning to Joe, I exclaimed:\r\n\r\n'I understand this. Get the auctioneer to postpone the sale for half an\r\nhour for dinner. Take Selly into the house.'\r\n\r\n'No. It might as well be over first as last. Let him bid--he's a dead\r\nman!' replied Joe coolly, but firmly.\r\n\r\n'You're mad, boy. Would you take his life needlessly?'\r\n\r\nThe auctioneer, who overheard these remarks, then said to me:\r\n\r\n'I will adjourn the sale, sir;' and, turning to the audience, he cried,\r\ndrawing out his watch: 'Gentlemen, it is twelve o'clock. The sale is\r\nadjourned for an hour, to give you a chance for dinner.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK vs. ANTONIO.\r\n\r\nOPINION OF THE VICAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Vicar desires briefly, modestly, and by way of suggestion, rather as\r\nAmicus Curiæ than as an advocate, to lay before his learned brethren of\r\nthe law a legal point or two, for their consideration.\r\n\r\nThe case to which I refer is well known to all the members of the bar as\r\nthat of Shylock--_versus_ Antonio, reported, in full, in 2 Shakspeare\r\n299. The decision which I am desirous of having reviewed, is that of the\r\nChief Justice, or Ducal Magistrate, who heard that curious case, and who\r\nyielded to the extraordinary arguments of the young woman, Portia. The\r\njudgment rendered, and the argument or decision of the Lady Advocate, on\r\nthat occasion, have been regarded as models of judicial acumen, have\r\nreceived the approbation of many worthy and enlightened students, and,\r\nwhen theatrically represented, have been greeted with the plaudits of\r\nnearly every theatre. It may be arrogant to impugn a judicial decision\r\nof such antiquity and acknowledged authority; but, as a member in full\r\nstanding of the worshipful P. B., I have the right to be slightly\r\narrogant; for I am well aware that this is a tribunal the circumference\r\nof whose jurisdiction is infinite, or rather is a circle whose centre is\r\na little village on the Hudson river, where I reside.\r\n\r\nNo false modesty shall restrain me, therefore, from discussing this case\r\nupon its merits. Before entering upon it, however, I desire to call your\r\nattention to a few preliminary points.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, I ask you--who are all familiar with the record--if\r\nan undue sympathy for the defendant, Antonio, was not felt on the trial?\r\nThe favor and good wishes of the court, the spectators, and of the\r\nreporter, were evidently enlisted for him as against his opponent. This\r\nAntonio, perhaps, was a very worthy fellow in his way; and in a criminal\r\naction--as on an indictment for murdering a family or two, or\r\nslaughtering a policeman--might have been, able to prove previous good\r\ncharacter. But such a plea, in a civil action for _debt_, is entitled to\r\nno weight, while the fact that he was a good fellow in a series of\r\nscrapes, not the least of which was matrimony, does not entitle him to\r\nour sympathy. The prejudices of the court ought to have been against\r\ninstead of for him. He had failed in business, could not pay his\r\noutstanding liabilities, and thus stood before the commercial world in\r\nthe position of bankruptcy. The fact that he had made a foolish\r\ncontract, which imperilled his life, does not improve his moral\r\ncondition, or entitle him to any just sympathy, unless it could be shown\r\nthat there was insanity in his family. No such plea was entered. His\r\ncounsel did not attempt to prove that his great-grandfather owned a mad\r\ndog; a plea from which the court, fortified by many modern criminal\r\ndecisions, might have inferred his moral insanity. No such attempt to\r\nrelieve Antonio from the consequences of his criminal folly was made,\r\nand I can see nothing in the case to entitle him to the sympathy which\r\nwas and had been always entertained for him.\r\n\r\nAgain: The lengthy and much-admired plea of the defendant's counsel on\r\nthe subject of mercy was clearly out of place, especially if, as I have\r\nendeavored to show, the defendant was not entitled to any particular\r\nclemency or sympathy. The remarks of Portia, commencing,\r\n\r\n  'The quality of Mercy is not strained,'\r\n\r\n(and, by the way, who but a woman would talk of straining an emotion as\r\none strains milk?) are wholly irrelevant to the issue, and ought not to\r\nhave been allowed. They were eloquent, indeed, but had nothing whatever\r\nto do with _the trial_, which arose on a very plain case at law: A owed\r\nB three thousand ducats, due and not paid on an ascertained day.\r\nWhereupon B moves the court for the penalty, and demands judgment. If\r\nthe defendant had no answer at law, there is an end to the case; and it\r\nwas very irregular, impertinent, and contrary to well-settled practice\r\nfor the defendant's counsel to endeavor to lead off the mind of the\r\ncourt from the true issue of the case. Portia, in what she says of mercy\r\nbeing 'twice blessed' and 'dropping like the gentle rain from heaven,'\r\n&c., &c., was, I fear, 'talking buncombe,' and all that part of her\r\nspeech should be stricken from the record, especially as it was\r\naddressed to the plaintiff instead of the court, a highly indecorous\r\nproceeding. Instead of indulging in all this sentimentality, her true\r\ncourse would have been to have filed a bill in equity against Shylock,\r\nand have obtained an injunction on an _ex parte_ affidavit, which only\r\nrequires a little strong swearing; or to have patched up a suit against\r\nhim for obtaining his knife under false pretences; than which (under the\r\nNew York code of procedure) nothing can be easier. But what better\r\nconduct of a suit can you expect from a she-advocate--an\r\nattorney-in-petticoats?\r\n\r\nAnd this brings me to another point of some delicacy, and which nothing\r\nbut a conscientious devotion to abstract justice would induce me to\r\ntouch upon. What law, or what precedent, can be cited to authorize a\r\nwoman to appear as an advocate in a court of justice and usurp the\r\noffices and prerogatives of a man? I will not dwell upon the impropriety\r\nof such conduct; but on my honor, as a member of the bar, the behavior\r\nof Portia was outrageous. This young female, not content with\r\n'cavorting' around the country in a loose and perspicuous style,\r\nactually practises a gross swindle on the court. She assumes to be a man\r\nwhen she is only a woman, dons the breeches when she is only entitled to\r\nthe skirts, and imposes herself upon the Duke of Venice as a learned\r\nyoung advocate from Rome, when in fact she is only a young damsel of\r\nBelmont, with half a dozen lovers on hand, on her own showing. And yet\r\nthis young baggage, whose own father would not trust her to choose a\r\nhusband, whose brains are addled by her own love affairs, and who had no\r\nmore business in court than the deacon would have in Chancellor\r\nWhiting's suit in the Lowber claim, not only came into court under a\r\nfraudulent disguise, argued the case under false pretences, but actually\r\ntook the words from the judge's own mouth, and decided her case on her\r\nown responsibility. I venture to say that such unparalleled impudence\r\nwas never witnessed out of the court of a justice of the peace, and that\r\neven Judge ---- (unless the editor of the ---- had interfered) would have\r\nmarched this false pretender out of court, or have deposited her in the\r\nTombs on an attachment of contempt.\r\n\r\nBut these preliminary points appear of small moment when we come to\r\nconsider the plea, if it be worthy of that name, which the counsel for\r\nthe defendant opposed to the suit of the plaintiff. The bond is\r\nadmitted, the penalty is confessed, the pound of flesh is forfeited, the\r\nbosom of Antonio is bared to the knife--when this brief but brief-less\r\nbarrister, this skylarking young judge of Belmont steps jauntily\r\nforward, with a most preposterous quibble on her lips, and manages by an\r\nadroit subtlety to defeat the judgment to which the plaintiff is legally\r\nentitled. She awards the flesh, fibres, nerves, adipose matter, in\r\ncontroversy, to Shylock; but declares his life and fortune confiscate if\r\nhe sheds a drop of blood, or takes more or less than the exact pound.\r\n\r\nNow if there be one principle of law better settled than another (and\r\nprobably it was as clearly set forth in the Revised Statutes of Venice\r\nas is set forth in our own common law), it is that a party entitled to\r\nthe possession of a commodity, whether grain, guano, dead or live men's\r\nflesh, bones and sinews, is entitled, also, to pursue the usual\r\nnecessary and appropriate means of obtaining the possession of the same.\r\nI appeal to Colonel W---- if this be not good law, and asking whether,\r\nif he be entitled to a dinner, he has not a right to seize upon it,\r\nwhenever or however he can find it; whether, if a man owes him a bottle\r\nof champagne, he has not the right to break the neck of the bottle if a\r\ncorkscrew is not convenient? So, to use a drier example, the sale of\r\nstanding timber entitles the purchaser to enter the land upon which it\r\nis situated, and to cut down and carry off his own property. On the same\r\nprinciple, if A sells B a house and lot, entirely surrounded by other\r\nland owned by A, B has clearly a right of way to his own wife and\r\nfireside over A's land. (2 Blackstone 1149.) A hundred examples might be\r\ngiven in point, but it would be insulting the dignity of this court to\r\nargue at length a theory so transparently clear. If the shedding of a\r\nfew drops of blood, more or less, was incidental and necessary to the\r\nrights of the plaintiff, if the article of personal property, forfeited\r\nto him on the bond, could be obtained in no other way, then, according\r\nto all the principles of law and common sense, he _had_ a right to spill\r\nthose drops, more or less; and that, too, without legal risk.\r\n\r\nIf the penalty was legal, and that were admitted, the method of exacting\r\nit was legal also. Portia's quibble was so transparent and barefaced\r\nthat the decision of the court can only be explained on the theory that\r\nthe court was drunk, or in love, which seems to have been the condition\r\nof several of the prominent parties in this proceeding, excepting always\r\nthe plaintiff. As to the other part of Portia's plea, it is doubtless\r\ntrue that the plaintiff would take more of the commodity involved in the\r\nsuit than the court awarded him at his peril; but as half a pound, or a\r\nquarter of a pound, cut off from the right spot would have answered his\r\npurpose, I do not see under what principle of law he was defrauded of\r\nthat satisfaction. There was nothing to have prevented him from cutting\r\nless than a pound from Antonio's body, and of so releasing him, the\r\ndefendant, from a portion of the penalty; and the court should have\r\ninstructed the plaintiff as to his rights in this particular, instead of\r\nadopting a quibble worthy of only a Tombs lawyer or a third-rate\r\npettifogger.\r\n\r\nI cannot then believe that Mr. Reporter Shakspeare, in handing down to\r\nposterity the record of this remarkable case, meant to express an\r\napproval of Portia's subterfuge. My inference rather is that he was\r\naiming a covert sarcasm at those women who thrust themselves\r\nconspicuously upon the notice of the public, and that he meant to hint\r\nthat those who thus unsex themselves often make a showy appearance\r\nwithout displaying much solid merit. If this subtle, sharp, and\r\nstrong-minded female did not turn out to be something of a shrew, before\r\nher husband was done with her, I am much mistaken. Possibly, however,\r\nShakspeare's sarcasm might bear a more general interpretation, and\r\nimplies that women in an argument seldom meet the true issue presented\r\nto them, but are prone to go off at a tangent on some side quibble, and\r\nto repel the arguments of their antagonists by the subtlety of their\r\ninventions rather than by the cogency of their logic. I appeal to my\r\nfriend, the sage of Cattaraugus, who has a large knowledge of the\r\ncustoms of the sex, if this be not the usual result.\r\n\r\nNot to cut the reply of the deacon too short, I go on to remark that\r\nwhether he agrees with me or not, neither he nor any other well-balanced\r\nman would have descended, on the trial of so important a case as the one\r\nwe are discussing, to a trivial playing upon words. Even my friend, the\r\ndistrict attorney, than whom no man is more remorselessly given--in\r\nprivate life--to the depraved habit of quibbling, and who never\r\nhesitates to impale truth upon the point of a verbal criticism, would by\r\nthe temptation of a fee commensurate with the vigor of the moral effort\r\nrequired, have discussed the question on broader and truer principles.\r\nHad he been retained on the part of Antonio, he would have proved\r\nhimself equal to the occasion, and have unfolded a logical and\r\nconsistent answer to the claim of the plaintiff.\r\n\r\nHe would have boldly attacked the bond itself, as absolutely void in its\r\ninception, because it was aimed at the life of a citizen of Venice, and\r\nwould have called upon the court to abrogate a contract which violated\r\nthe very laws that the court was bound to administer. With his usual\r\neloquence, he would have urged that a penalty so illegal, immoral, and\r\nmonstrous, and which involved the commission of the highest crime,\r\nexcept treason, known to the laws of the state, could never be enforced\r\nin a civilized country. He would have offered to the court no woman's\r\nquibble like that of Portia, based upon the assumption that the penalty\r\nof a bond which sanctioned a high and capital crime could be enforced in\r\na court of law; and in fine, would have addressed an argument to the\r\nreason and understanding of the court which might render a consideration\r\nof this case by the tribunal unnecessary.\r\n\r\nBut no good plea to the plaintiff's cause of action was made on the\r\ntrial, and the court was, and I fear that the whole world has been\r\ndeceived by Portia's subterfuge. We must, therefore, regard Shylock as a\r\nbadly used man. After all, he was no worse than many creditors and note\r\nshavers of this day, who _only_ demand the life blood of their victims,\r\nand if on the pleas before the court he was entitled to judgment, like\r\nthem he should have had it. Doubtless in private life Shylock was a very\r\nhonest and well-behaved gentleman, not a mere mountebank as he is\r\nsometimes represented on the stage, but a vigorous and energetic man of\r\nthe world, shrewd, sagacious, and long sighted in business, honored on\r\nchange, respected by his friends, and a pattern of prudence and\r\nmorality. And then, perhaps, he was only carrying on a joke, a kind of\r\n_Jew d'esprit_, conceived in a moment of amiable eccentricity, and never\r\nto be executed. If not a joke, however, the judgment of Judge Portia\r\nshould be set aside, and a new trial, with costs, should, in my opinion,\r\nhave been ordered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA HEROINE OF TO-DAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had watched with her alternate nights throughout all her illness, but\r\nthis night we thought would be her last, and neither of us was willing\r\nto leave her. The surgeons and nurses had gone, and we were at last\r\nalone. We sat through the remaining hours in deathly stillness,\r\noccasionally moistening the lips and tongue of the sufferer. It was the\r\nlast office of friendship, and I yielded it, though reluctantly, to her\r\nearliest and dearest friend. Monotonous the hours were, but not long. We\r\nwould have made them longer if we could, for though the waning life\r\nbefore us was but the faintest shadow of the life we had companioned\r\nwith, we were loath to lose it--to face the blank that would be left\r\nwhen it was gone.\r\n\r\nOne, two, three o'clock sounded, and still no perceptible change; but\r\nsoon after the breathing became shorter, a slight film gathered on her\r\neyes, and we stood in the presence of the last great mystery. Shorter\r\nand shorter grew the breath, deeper and deeper the film, till, just as\r\nthe first gray light showed itself in the eastern horizon, came the last\r\nsigh, and Mrs. Simmons, leaning forward, exclaimed in a low voice, 'It\r\nis over.' As for me, I buried my face in the pillow and wept\r\nunrestrainedly.\r\n\r\nIn a hospital the day treads closely on the night, and soon the morning\r\ncame. We retired to our apartment for rest, but we could not sleep. We\r\ncould only think of our loss, and after an hour or two we rose, somewhat\r\nrested, but not refreshed. Ever since my first acquaintance with\r\nLaetitia Sunderland, I had eagerly desired to learn her previous life.\r\nGlimpses of it I had obtained, but I wanted it as a whole, and now I was\r\nwith one, perhaps for the last time, who could give me a full account of\r\nit. It was an opportunity not to be lost, and while partaking of our\r\nmorning coffee, I asked Mrs. Simmons if she would tell me what I so\r\nlonged to know. She willingly assented, and as I was relieved from duty\r\nfor the day, and the morning was mild and beautiful, we sought a rustic\r\nseat in the garden, and there in a little nook retired from view, I\r\nheard the story of that life to which my own during the past year had\r\nbeen so closely knit.\r\n\r\n'There is one thing,' said Mrs. Simmons, 'in regard to our friend, to\r\nwhich we have never alluded, and which, perhaps, you would rather have\r\nme now pass over; but on that very thing her whole character and history\r\nturn, and to omit it would leave nothing worth the telling--I mean her\r\npersonal appearance.\r\n\r\n'When I was a child, my parents moved into the suburbs of Condar, and as\r\nthere were no houses between ours and Mr. Sunderland's, the two families\r\nsoon became well acquainted. On the day that I was ten years old, my\r\nmother told me there was a baby girl at Mrs. Sunderland's, and said she\r\nwould take me to see it. I was delighted, and wanted to go immediately,\r\nbut mother said I must wait till to-morrow. To-morrow came, and I was\r\nsick; and at last the baby was a week old when I was taken, the happiest\r\nlittle mortal in existence, into that upper room where the little one\r\nlay in its nurse's arms. I looked at it, and then at my mother.'\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter, Mary?' said she.\r\n\r\n\"It isn't a very pretty baby, is it, mother?'\r\n\r\n\"Oh it will grow prettier,\" said my mother, and with that I was\r\nsatisfied. I was extravagantly fond of babies, and this one I adopted as\r\nmy especial care, for there was no other in the neighborhood; and\r\nbesides, in my childish confusion of ideas, I supposed we were twins,\r\nour birthdays being the same.\r\n\r\n'From the time Laetitia first learned to speak, she came to me with all\r\nher troubles and her interests, and I was always glad to be her\r\nsympathizer, her counsellor, and her playmate. When she was five or six\r\nyears old she went to the nearest district school. She was always a\r\nmarked girl, from her extreme homeliness, her excellent scholarship, her\r\nboldness in all active sports, and an odd humor which never failed to\r\ninterest and amuse. My mother's prophecy, alas! was not fulfilled. She\r\ngrew no prettier, but rather the reverse. She was the same in childhood\r\nas when you knew her, with the high, bold forehead, crowned with white,\r\ntowy hair, small greenish-gray eyes, shaded and yet not shaded with\r\nlight yellowish eyelashes, short and thin; scanty eyebrows of the same\r\ncolor; a nose so small and flat it seemed scarcely a projection from her\r\nface; teeth tolerably good, but chin and mouth receding in a peculiar\r\nmanner, and very disagreeably; and a thick, waxy complexion, worse in\r\nchildhood than of late years, for the spirit had not then found its way\r\nthrough it, as it did afterward. Moreover, by a singular malignancy of\r\nfortune, when she was twelve years old, she was attacked with varioloid,\r\nand taking a severe cold as she was getting well, had a relapse, and was\r\nleft as you see her, not closely marked, but sufficiently pitted to\r\nattract attention.\r\n\r\n'My parents thought more of education than the Sunderlands, and my\r\nadvantages were much better than Laetitia's. I went for some time to a\r\ngood select school in the town, and afterward two years to an excellent\r\nboarding school. When Laetitia had learned all that her instructors in\r\nthe little district school could teach her, she came to me and begged\r\nthat I would let her read with me. I was very glad to do so, and soon\r\nafter my cousin and niece joined us. To those readings I am indebted for\r\nsome of the most delightful hours of my life. My pupils, as I used to\r\ncall them, were at that age when childhood is verging into womanhood,\r\nand it was my delight to watch the first dawnings of consciousness in\r\ntheir minds, the first awakening to the realities of life. Laetitia was\r\nthe youngest of the three, but she was as intelligent and mature as the\r\nothers. How well I remember the glow of enthusiasm with which she read\r\nof the heroes and martyrs of old, the intense sympathy with which she\r\nentered into the _amor patriæ_ of the Greek and Roman, and her fervent\r\nadmiration for the nobleness of action which this feeling called forth\r\nin them!\r\n\r\n'The second year I began to see the development of new sentiments. The\r\nromance of life, as well as its heroism and duties, was revealed to\r\nthem. Pieces of poetry which before had been read listlessly, or with\r\nonly a distant apprehension of their meaning, were now full of interest.\r\nThe sentiment which had passed unnoticed, now kindled their imaginations\r\nwith delight; and there came, too, all the new attentions to dress and\r\nlooks which first show themselves at this time. Life lay before them,\r\ngolden and beautiful, and they saw all its shining angels coming to meet\r\nthem--love, friendship, duty, praise, self-sacrifice, each with a joy in\r\nher hand, but the sorrow was concealed from their eyes, or, rather, was\r\nbut another form of joy. They admitted its probability, but it was with\r\nthe disguised pleasure which we feel in the troubles of the heroines of\r\nromance.\r\n\r\n'Laetitia shared these feelings with the others, though with less\r\nreason; but her thought and imagination were so vivid, and gave color so\r\ncompletely to her life, that it would have been as absurd for her as for\r\nthem to have looked at the probabilities of the case. Never once did she\r\nsay to herself, that to one in her circumstances, life would most likely\r\nbe full of disappointments and commonplace incidents. But time, the\r\ngreat revealer, soon opened to her those pages which her wisest friend\r\nwould not have dared to show her so early.\r\n\r\n'One evening I went to Mrs. Sunderland's on some trivial errand. The\r\nfamily were all out excepting Laetitia, whom I found sitting by the\r\nwindow, in the dark, with her head resting on her hand. Her manner\r\nindicated great depression; and I looked at her a moment and said, 'My\r\ndear child, what is the matter with you this evening?'\r\n\r\n'Her head dropped upon the table, and she burst into tears. She\r\ncontinued to weep and sob, till, seeing she was not relieved, I put my\r\nhand upon her shoulder and said, 'Laetitia, Laetitia, don't cry so.'\r\n\r\n'Don't call me Laetitia,' she replied. 'I shall never be Laetitia\r\nagain.'\r\n\r\n'The answer seemed melodramatic, but I knew she was suffering. Still I\r\nresponded lightly: 'Oh yes, you will be Laetitia many, many times yet.\r\n'Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning,' you\r\nknow.'\r\n\r\n'She did not reply, and we sat a while in silence, till at length I\r\nbegged of her to tell me the cause of her grief, just to see if I could\r\nnot help her. I think she wanted to tell it, for she tried two or three\r\ntimes, but could not get any further than 'Yesterday afternoon'--At last\r\nshe said, 'I have a very great trouble; it will never be any less as\r\nlong as I live, and it will forever keep me from being happy. I _cannot_\r\ntell it to you: can you help me without knowing it?'\r\n\r\n'This was a new appeal, and I did not know how to answer it, but a\r\nthought came to me, and I replied: 'Go and tell God about it.'\r\n\r\n'This I said at a venture, for, old as I was, I had never called upon\r\nHim in deep distress, and I did not know what the effect would be; but I\r\nsaw immediately that the advice was unexpected, and seemed to meet the\r\nexigency.\r\n\r\n'Her mother's voice was at that moment heard at the door, and I went out\r\nto give Laetitia an opportunity of slipping off to her room without\r\nmeeting the family.\r\n\r\n''Have you seen 'Titia?' said Mrs. Sunderland to me.\r\n\r\n''Yes, she has just gone to her room.'\r\n\r\n''Well, I don't know what's the matter with the child since last night,\r\nshe's acted so queer. I 'spect she'll get over it, though; she always\r\ndid have tantrums.'\r\n\r\n'In one sense, however, she never did get over it, and it was many years\r\nbefore she really recovered much of her old light-heartedness, although\r\nshe had an appearance of it to superficial companions. For a long time\r\nher inner life was shut from the view of her friends; but I am at\r\npresent able to read it for you, partly from what she herself told me\r\nafterward, and partly from that insight which we all have into those\r\nlives and experiences with which we are in sympathy.\r\n\r\n'One afternoon she left me very happy and gay, and went to see a friend\r\nnear the town. She was returning slowly toward home, satisfied with\r\nherself, and enjoying intensely the beauty of the season, when she saw\r\ntwo ladies approaching her. They were strangers, and she looked at them\r\nwith interest, attracted by their pleasing faces and graceful bearing.\r\nAs they passed her, she overheard one of them say in an undertone, 'What\r\na frightfully homely girl!'\r\n\r\n'There could be no mistake. She only was meant, and the words went like\r\na sharp dagger to her heart.\r\n\r\n'While she was thinking how charming they were, she to them appeared\r\nonly frightful. The whole future in an instant opened before her, and\r\nshe saw herself, as she moved through it, constantly exciting, wherever\r\nshe went, only repulsion in the minds of strangers and friends.\r\n\r\n'All the charm and interest of life fled at the moment. That day and the\r\nnext she was in a stupor of grief, from which she was first awakened by\r\nmy tones of sympathy. My advice, too, opened a door of relief by giving\r\nher something to _do_. For the first time she remembered there was a\r\nBeing who knew all about her sorrow, knew it was coming, understood its\r\ncause, and its effects. This Being she could open her mind to, and only\r\nto Him. He would not be surprised, and He would not annoy her with\r\nsympathy which could not cure and would only irritate. She knelt down,\r\nand with minute fidelity told Him every thought of her heart. The next\r\nday she felt cheerful--she thought she was resigned; but it was only the\r\nreaction caused by the tears and confession of the previous night, and\r\nit soon passed away. The words 'frightfully homely' echoed and re-echoed\r\nthrough her heart. All that was dreary, hopeless, and miserable\r\nclustered around them, and shut out from her the bright, happy life of\r\nthe past. Her duties were performed as before. With others she was\r\nsufficiently animated; but when alone, she was wretched. Thus the months\r\nrolled on, till they became a year; and I, who had never been deceived\r\nby her occasional liveliness, began to think what I could do to change\r\nthe current of her thoughts, which seemed to have no tendency to change\r\nof themselves.\r\n\r\n'But Laetitia's life was not all feeling. Feeling suffers passively,\r\nwith greater or less endurance, according to the strength of the\r\nphysical frame, but the intellect always seeks a remedy for sorrow. It\r\nseemed horrible to her that she of all the world--of all her world, at\r\nleast--should be so homely that no one could look on her without pain.\r\nIt was intolerable, it ought not to have been, but it _was_ permitted,\r\nit must be. Rebellion came of course, bitter rebellion, but it could do\r\nno good. There was the fate, it was impossible to escape it. What then?\r\nDrag through a miserable life till death came happily to relieve it? She\r\nwas too young. Fifty, sixty years of travel over a dreary, barren waste,\r\nwith no joy upon it? No, no, she could not do it--suicide first. But\r\nsuicide was wrong, and could never be resorted to. There _must_ be some\r\nrelief elsewhere. Where was it? what was it?\r\n\r\n'Continual dropping will wear away a stone, and continual thinking will\r\nwear a hollow into the stoniest of mysteries. At length, through all the\r\nmists of proximate causes and natural laws, some glorious truths became\r\nclear to her. The near and the visible receded to their proper\r\nimportance, and she learned to hold principles and ideas more dear than\r\nthe externals which embody them. She saw that God loves His children\r\nequally, and though the laws of nature must take their course, there is\r\nroom for each result in His design; and in the infinite of His heart and\r\nHis work each individual has place and purpose. She found, too, that\r\nangels laden with joy might descend and ascend between His soul and hers\r\nwithout a ladder made of earthly triumphs and successes. Thus in place\r\nof rebellion came happy acquiescence.\r\n\r\n'But she was not yet contented. She was convinced that there was a life\r\nfor her which she could not or would not lead if she were like others;\r\nbut this life she could not find. She saw no intimations of it in\r\nherself. She had no genius for any special thing, and she continued\r\nrestless and disturbed, wondering what it was appointed to her to do. At\r\nlength it came to her.\r\n\r\n'One day, as she was passing the house of her physician, through the\r\nopen window she saw and heard that which induced her to go in and offer\r\nher services. A man in a disgusting stage of intoxication had cut his\r\narm badly, and had come to have it bound up. His little child was with\r\nhim, shrieking with terror, her face and clothes covered with dirt. The\r\ndoctor roughly and with ill-concealed repugnance was caring for the\r\nwound, while the cook, with no attempt at concealment, was loudly\r\nexpressing her disapprobation of the whole proceeding. Laetitia assisted\r\nthe doctor, and washed off the blood; then took the child home with her,\r\nbathed her, gave her clean clothes and a dinner, and sent her away with\r\na new happiness in her heart. While she was doing all this, she found\r\nwhat she had been seeking. There are very many things in this world\r\ndisagreeable in the extreme, which ought to be done with interest, with\r\ncare, with _love_. Why should she not undertake to do them? In\r\nthemselves they would be repugnant, but _she_ would do them for God, and\r\nshe loved her Heavenly Father so well that the hardest thing done for\r\nHim would be the sweetest. In a day or two the feeling settled itself:\r\nit was firmly impressed upon her mind that in these employments she\r\nwould have rest.\r\n\r\n'One morning, about two years perhaps after the first day of her sorrow,\r\nshe dropped into my room with something of her old suddenness, and,\r\nafter the customary greetings, said simply: 'I am happy again now.'\r\n\r\n''You need not tell me that: I can see it in your face.'\r\n\r\n'The pleased expression remained for a moment, and then an intensely\r\nblack cloud fell upon her countenance. She said nothing more, and in a\r\nfew minutes went away. You see how it was--by one of those freaks by\r\nwhich the imagination loves to torture us, my remark recalled her whole\r\nmisery and its unalterable cause, and having lost for the time the\r\nkeynote to her new-found joy, the other took entire possession of her\r\nmind and overwhelmed it. In a few days she came back to me, and I said:\r\n'I pained you when you were here before. I do not know how, but I am\r\nvery sorry.'\r\n\r\n'You did pain me, but you were entirely innocent. Afterward it grieved\r\nme still more that I _was_ pained--that what you said had the _power_ to\r\npain me. I will tell you all, if you will hear it;' and, without waiting\r\nfor my answer, she gave me the key to the last two years of her life.\r\n\r\n'She finished, but I had nothing to reply. She had said all. Hitherto I\r\nhad led her, but now her experience was deeper than mine. Besides, I\r\ncould then less than ever understand the life that was opening before\r\nher, for I had just yielded my heart and promised my hand to one whom I\r\nloved; and though I by no means thought it impossible that she, too,\r\nmight have tried the same path, yet I knew she thought so; and I could\r\nnot conceive how she could look forward with contentment to a life in\r\nwhich that element of happiness was wanting. I could only assure her of\r\nmy own warm affection, an assurance which gave her a pleasure that it\r\nalways makes me happy to think of.\r\n\r\n'Notwithstanding the apparently contradictory evidence of her late\r\ndepression, her new experience was not precarious and uncertain: it was\r\nfirm, enduring, to be _rested_ upon in the most trying emergencies; yet\r\nit was not, for many years, unwavering. During all that period of a\r\nwoman's life when looks and manners pass for so much, and the real\r\ncharacter for so little, she suffered at times greatly. As she went\r\nonward, every new phase of the feelings which possess a girl's heart\r\nbrought with it its own pang, and each had to be overcome, some by\r\nstifling, some by postponement to another existence, and others by\r\nstudying to dissever, if possible, the essential sentiment from the\r\nshows in which it was imbedded. She was unwilling passively to outgrow\r\nher trials, feeling that thereby she would lose the strength they were\r\nintended to give. Her work, however, helped her more than anything. She\r\nwas not eager to enter upon it. She did not stretch forth impatient,\r\nunskilled hands toward what her Father had designed for her. Entirely\r\nconfident, she was right, she was at ease, knowing her work would come\r\nto her in the proper time, and it did.\r\n\r\n'I must say something about this work of hers, else you will be misled.\r\nShe undertook to do that which others would not do, or would not do\r\nwell, owing to a natural dislike to the thing itself. Not intending to\r\nbecome a drudge, she did not allow indolence or sentimentality to shift\r\nupon her that which others would be all the better for doing themselves.\r\nShe knew what Master she served, and looked to Him for guidance, and not\r\nto the wishes and opinions of her fellow mortals. Gradually she found\r\nenough to do, first in her own house, and then outside. Friends and\r\nacquaintances called upon her, philanthropic societies applied for her\r\nservices, surgeons and nurses sought her assistance, and even strangers\r\nlearned that there was one who would willingly do for them, in cases of\r\nemergency, what they could not do, and what no wages could procure well\r\ndone. As her life became known, she obtained the respect of some, the\r\ncontempt of others, and the wonderment of most. I will not specify what\r\nshe did, for my story is already getting too long; but you would be\r\nsurprised to know how often she was needed.\r\n\r\n'Her means, though small, were large enough to allow her to do most of\r\nher work gratuitously, but she received sufficient pecuniary\r\ncompensation during the year to enable her to provide well for herself\r\nand give much to others.\r\n\r\n'In pursuing the duties of her vocation, she came in contact at one time\r\nor another with almost every kind of misery, and though, from\r\nfamiliarity, she ceased to be shocked at new forms of suffering, yet she\r\nnever became hardened, but each year grew more tender and sympathizing.\r\n\r\n'In due time the practical workings of the great sin of the nineteenth\r\ncentury came under her observation. She talked with fugitive slaves, and\r\nall the pent-up fire within her burst forth in intense indignation. She\r\nhad not thought of the question before--it had not been in her way; but\r\nnow every feeling, her love of God, her love of country, her great\r\ninterest in human rights and destinies, conspired to make her throw her\r\nwhole soul into it, and she saw slavery as it is, its intense wickedness\r\nand its fearful results. She looked with dismay at its effect upon the\r\ncountry, its 'trail' upon everything in it, on church, on politics, on\r\nsociety, on commerce, on manufactures, on education. There was nothing\r\nwhich had not been corrupted by it--it was fast eating into the vitals\r\nof religion and liberty. The more she studied the subject the more\r\nearnest grew her feeling. But what should she do? She had not lost\r\nself-love, that passion which never deserts us; but she had lost its\r\n_glamour_--eyes that have wept much see clear--and she knew that the\r\nleast valuable offering which a woman without good looks, high position,\r\nor great talent, can make to an unpopular cause, is--herself. So far\r\nfrom her conspicuous support of a new thing being an encouragement and\r\nassistance to others, it would be a hindrance: fear of being identified\r\nwith her would be another lion to be encountered in the path.\r\n\r\n'She loved her cause better than she loved herself, and would not make\r\nit more odious by any marked advocacy of it. It was a new trial to her,\r\nbut she did not murmur. One who in early youth has rebelled against the\r\nvery laws by which he has his existence, and has become reconciled, does\r\nnot go through life hitting his head against every projection which\r\nsociety thrusts in his way. She did what she could. She cleared\r\n_herself_, as far as possible, from all participation in the sin, gladly\r\navowed her views when called upon, and never hesitated to show, by\r\nsuitable words and acts, her sympathy with a despised people. Yet she\r\ncould not accomplish much. But if she did little for the cause, it did a\r\ngreat deal for her. It broadened her life, enlarged her views, increased\r\nher comprehension of the world's progress as revealed in history, and\r\nbrought her into closer sympathy with reformers of all ages. It gave her\r\na perpetual object of interest. It was like a great drama, whose acts\r\nwere years and whose scenes were continually passing before her. It gave\r\na new zest to life, made this world more real, and diminished her\r\nlongings for the next. In narrowing her friendships it made them more\r\nvital and satisfactory; and being in communion with hundreds of other\r\nminds in the country, reading their thoughts became almost like personal\r\nintercourse with them, and was a new happiness to her. Studying daily a\r\nsubject of such vast complications, her mind perceptibly grew, and from\r\nyear to year she was able to grasp new and higher truths. She gained the\r\nhatred of a few clear-sighted opponents, but most persons only ridiculed\r\nher, contemptuously wondering why she should pursue this course when her\r\ninterest lay so clearly the other way. But she was now far beyond the\r\nreach of such weapons.\r\n\r\n'I have given you, thus, a sketch of the history and character of\r\nLaetitia, but I cannot reproduce her as she appears to my own mind. You\r\nmust fill up the outlines from your own personal knowledge. I fear I\r\nhave rendered her too intense, and, perhaps, too sombre. Intense she\r\ncertainly was, but it did not oppress one in ordinary intercourse; and\r\nshe was not at all sombre. After she recovered fully from her youthful\r\ngrief, her elasticity of temperament returned, and her love of fun. She\r\nlooked on the bright side of all things, and was full of encouragement\r\nand hope for her friends. To me, besides being, during the last five\r\nyears particularly, a valuable friend and adviser--no one but myself can\r\nknow how valuable--she was always an interesting companion. And yet she\r\nwas not generally liked. She was seldom understood. Her life was so\r\ndeep, her tone of thought so peculiar; and her dependence upon the\r\nopinions of others so slight, that persons ordinarily could not 'make\r\nher out,' as they said. Still she had very warm friends, and derived\r\ngreat pleasure from their friendship. I have never seen any one derive\r\nmore. But she distrusted strangers; I mean their interest in her. She\r\ndid not expect new persons to care for her, and it took her a long while\r\nto be sure that they did. I must myself confess, for the first and last\r\ntime, that until within two or three years I never met her after an\r\nabsence without being newly impressed with her exceeding homeliness. It\r\nwas a sin against friendship, I knew, and I was glad when I felt I was\r\nfree from it.'\r\n\r\n'It was not so with me,' I said. 'After I became accustomed to her face\r\nit never affected me unpleasantly. I did not see the features, but the\r\nspirit which animated them.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, you were with her continually, and, besides, she must have been so\r\ncompletely identified in your mind with the relief of pain, that you\r\ncould think of her only as an angel of mercy. It was a great advantage\r\nto her that she was always scrupulously neat in her dress and person;\r\nand her clothes, too, were well put on, if without a great deal of\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n'Upon the whole, her life was a happy one, though not perhaps triumphant\r\nexcept in periods of exaltation, for there was a large part of her\r\nnature unsatisfied; but she was thoroughly contented, willingly living\r\nas long as was necessary, glad to go whenever the time came. She never\r\nexpected to die young, but she did; she was only thirty-six.'\r\n\r\n'She seemed older,' I said.\r\n\r\n'Yes, she always looked older than she was, and then she had lived so\r\nmuch that she necessarily impressed one as being old.\r\n\r\n'She followed,' continued Mrs. Simmons, resuming her narrative, 'with\r\nincreasing interest the progress of the grand anti-slavery drama, until\r\nthat winter which, in defiance of all mathematical measurements, every\r\nAmerican _knows_ to be the longest in the annals of his country. With\r\nfixed attention she watched every event, every indication. What next\r\nwould come she could not see, but she felt sure she should have some\r\npart in it, whatever it was. At length the signal gun pealed forth, the\r\nfirst shot was fired, the spell was broken. She wrote me, 'America calls\r\nher sons and daughters. Up! up! to work! all true-hearted men and women!\r\nlive for me, die for me, and your reward shall be everlasting. There is\r\na work for all, for all who love freedom, for all who love democracy,\r\nfor all who love humanity, for all who love right law, union, and\r\npeace.'\r\n\r\n'She felt that all her life had been preparing for this moment. Averse\r\nto war as she was from instinct and principle, she yet believed it\r\nnecessary in the progress of the world, and her clear eyes scattered all\r\nthe sophisms which made both sides partly wrong and partly right. She\r\nlooked only at essential principles, and she saw that on one side was\r\nGod, and in the current of His good will to men they were fighting; on\r\nthe other was Satan, and by whatever plausible arguments he might\r\ndeceive some, he could never do aught but cause and perpetuate evil. Her\r\nmind was quickly made up, and she asked me in her letter what steps she\r\nshould take. I sent for her to come to me, and we applied to a committee\r\nto receive her as nurse. A great many questions were asked her, and then\r\nher application was accepted; but she was kept waiting for the final\r\nanswer more than a week. Fast as heads and hearts and hands moved in\r\nthose days, still time could not be annihilated--it must have its place\r\nin every work. I was present when her case was discussed.\r\n\r\n''I think she is an enthusiast,' said one; 'I am sure she will not do.'\r\n\r\n''We are all enthusiasts now,' answered another; 'that does not make any\r\ndifference.'\r\n\r\n''I don't believe she is,' exclaimed a pretty young woman; 'behind such\r\na face there can be only a very matter-of-fact mind.'\r\n\r\n'A tall, cold-looking lady said: 'No, she is a devotee; I know it by her\r\nmanner. We do not want such persons.'\r\n\r\n''I do not think we can afford to lose her services,' interrupted\r\nanother, who had been looking over a pile of papers. 'Listen to her\r\ntestimonials. Here is one from Dr. Weston, another from the Rev. Mr.\r\nSamuels, and others. Listen, she is just the one we want.'\r\n\r\nAll listened, and when Laetitia came, after another flood of questions,\r\nher credentials were given her. During this delay, though she was, like\r\nall the rest of us, at white heat regarding her country, she was\r\nentirely quiet about herself. I asked her what she would do if she were\r\nnot accepted. 'I shall go,' said she, 'whatever obstacles are thrown in\r\nthe way.' She started very soon for the seat of war. I came here with\r\nher to see that she had everything she needed, and you know the rest\r\nbetter than I do.'\r\n\r\nYes, I knew the rest, for I had been with her ever since.\r\n\r\nThough a resident of Washington, I was not 'to the manor born,' but a\r\n'mudsill' from Vermont, and when the war broke out I applied to be\r\nreceived into the hospitals, but was refused on account of want of\r\nexperience. Intent, notwithstanding, upon making my services necessary,\r\nI passed part of every day in one or other of them. One day I noticed a\r\nnew comer. Her head was bent down as I approached her; but when I\r\npassed, she looked up for a moment, and I had a glimpse of her face.\r\n'That is the homeliest face I ever saw,' said I to myself. It will be a\r\nperpetual annoyance to me. I am sorry she has come.' The next day I was\r\nagain in that hospital, and, standing near a door which opened into a\r\nside room, I overheard a conversation going on between a surgeon and a\r\nlady. It was not of a private nature, and I kept my place and listened\r\nto it. I was charmed by the agreeable tones of the lady, her well-chosen\r\nwords, and the great good sense and tender kindness of her remarks. 'I\r\nmust know that woman,' said I, 'she will be a treasure if she is going\r\nto stay here.' She came out, and I recognized the homely nurse of the\r\nprevious day. I was astonished, but my prejudice was entirely disarmed.\r\nI soon made her acquaintance, and gradually established myself as her\r\nassistant, until, at her request, I was allowed to take up my abode in\r\nthe building.\r\n\r\nHer presence in the hospital was soon evident. The surgeons found with\r\nsurprise that her skill and knowledge were equal to every requirement,\r\nthat she shrank from no task, however fearfully repelling it might be,\r\nand they quickly began to avail themselves of her womanly deftness. To\r\nthe soldiers she was a perpetual blessing. Every means which her\r\nthoughtful experience could suggest she put in requisition to soothe\r\ntheir pain or strengthen them to bear it. Nature, who never denies all\r\ngifts to any of her children, had given her a good voice, not powerful,\r\nbut sweet and penetrating, and often, when all else failed, I have seen\r\nher lull a patient to sleep with some favorite tune set to appropriate\r\nwords. Priceless indeed were her services, and priceless was the\r\nrecompense she received.\r\n\r\nBut for the humor that peeped out occasionally in Miss Sunderland, to an\r\nordinary observer her character--as she moved unambitiously through the\r\nwards, doing always the right thing at the right time, unexpectant of\r\nblame and regardless of praise, obeying directions apparently to the\r\nvery letter, yet never allowing the mistakes or carelessness of the\r\ndirector to mar her own work--would have seemed almost colorless; but I\r\nhave never considered myself an ordinary observer where character is\r\nconcerned, and I soon saw that hers was not the unreasoning goodness of\r\ninstinct, that it derived life and tone from a past full of culture and\r\ndiscipline. I noticed in her three things particularly: First, complete\r\nand unusual happiness, a happiness entirely independent of the incidents\r\nof the day. It was as if an unclouded sun were perpetually shining in\r\nher heart. This came, I knew afterward, from the fact that she was\r\nserving the cause she loved most, that she was doing her work well, and\r\nthat through it and connected with it she found place for all her best\r\nqualities and highest knowledge. Second, her thorough refinement.\r\nWithout, as I perceived, hereditary breeding, and without conventional\r\npruderies, she had a rare purity and elevation of feeling, which exerted\r\na manifest and constant influence, sadly needed in a soldiers' hospital.\r\nThird, her life within. From choice, not from necessity, her life\r\ncontinually turned upon itself; from within she found her chief motive,\r\nsanction, and reward, and this took from her intercourse with others all\r\npettiness, and made their relations to herself uncommonly truthful.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, as the scene of battle shifted, we removed to other\r\nhospitals, I always accompanying Miss Sunderland; but at last, in the\r\nspring, we again got back to Washington. The battles all around were\r\nraging fearfully, and the wounded were continually brought to us in\r\nscores. Day and night Miss Sunderland was engaged. Usually careful of\r\nherself in the extreme, she seemed now to forget all prudence.\r\n\r\n'You cannot endure this,' said I one day to her. 'Your first duty is to\r\ntake care of your health.'\r\n\r\n'No, no,' said she, 'my first duty is to save the lives of these men;\r\nthe second, to take care of my health for their future benefit; but I\r\ncannot give out now. Don't you see how necessary my work is?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I see it,' I replied. 'I don't know how you could spare yourself,\r\nbut it does not seem right that you should be entirely worn out.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, it _is_ right,' answered she; 'a life saved now is of as much\r\nconsequence as one saved next year. I am useful at this time, for I\r\nunderstand my profession; but others are learning the art of nursing in\r\nno feeble school, and if I die, you will find plenty of new comers ready\r\nto fill my place.'\r\n\r\nI knew from this that she anticipated the result, yet neither did I\r\nmyself see how it could be avoided; but I resolved to watch and spare\r\nher all I could.\r\n\r\nDuring all the year, notwithstanding her unceasing cares, she had kept\r\nherself well informed on public affairs. She knew every incident of the\r\nwar, and particularly all its moral defeats and victories. At one time\r\ndefeats of both kinds seemed to come thick and fast. She would shudder\r\nsometimes, as she laid down the newspaper, and say: 'This prolongs the\r\nwar such a time;' weeks, months, or years, as it might be; but she never\r\nwas really disheartened. She did not doubt that the contest, when it did\r\ncome to a conclusion, would end in the triumph of the right, in the\r\ntriumph of freedom, in the regeneration of the nation; and her courage\r\nnever yielded, her resolution never faltered, till one day in the latter\r\npart of May.\r\n\r\nShe went out then in the afternoon to breathe the fresh air she so much\r\nneeded, but in a half hour came back with a new look in her face. A\r\nstern, forbidding expression did not leave her during the day, and at\r\nnight she tossed about on her bed, wakeful and disturbed. At length she\r\nrose, and sat for more than an hour by the window in the darkness,\r\nseeking that peace which had left her so unaccountably. A new thought,\r\nin time, took possession of her. She went back, and slept. In the\r\nmorning she called me to her, and told me that on the previous day she\r\nhad seen a black man knocked down in the streets of Washington and\r\ncarried in chains to slavery. Then she said in earnest tones: 'Child'\r\n(she always called me _child_, though I was not much younger than\r\nherself), 'have you in your life done all that you could do against this\r\nabomination?'\r\n\r\n'No,' said I.\r\n\r\n'You hate it?' She asked; 'you understand its vileness, and hate it?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I do now, from the bottom of my heart.'\r\n\r\n'Will you not promise me that until you die, you will, regardless of\r\nself, use every effort in your power against it?'\r\n\r\n'I will, in all solemness and truth.'\r\n\r\nShe was satisfied, and said no more, for she never wasted words, and I\r\nrecognized this as her legacy to me. The next day she was taken ill. I\r\nimmediately sent for Mrs. Simmons, who thought she would be able to take\r\nher home with her; but before she arrived, I saw it would not be\r\npossible. Her only hope of recovery was in remaining where she was.\r\n\r\nMrs. Simmons came, and Miss Sunderland, notwithstanding our careful\r\npreparations, was so overcome with emotion at meeting her old friend,\r\nthat for some time she could scarcely speak. After this warmth of\r\nfeeling had subsided, she looked up in her face with a pleasant smile,\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n'I was well named, after all. I have entered into the joy of my Lord.'\r\n\r\nThe next day she had an earnest talk with her friend on the present\r\nstate of the country. Her faith had returned through intuition, but the\r\ngrasp of her intellect was weakened by disease, and she could not see\r\nclearly the grounds of it. Mrs. Simmons, though she had, like the rest\r\nof us, seasons of doubt, was in a very hopeful mood that morning,\r\nhopeful for our leading men, for the common people, and for the tendency\r\nof events; and she explained the reasons for her belief that the\r\nenormities of that period were no new crime, but a remnant of the old\r\nnot to be eradicated at once, any more than it is possible for an\r\nindividual to turn from great baseness to real goodness without some\r\nbackslidings, even after the most unmistakable of conversions. Miss\r\nSunderland was satisfied, the future again became clear to her, and\r\nafter that she seemed to lose interest in the details of affairs. Her\r\nthoughts and conversation were filled with heaven and a regenerated\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nWe clung to hope as long as possible, but she herself saw the end of the\r\ndisease from the beginning. She talked with us, and with the soldiers\r\nwho were permitted to see her, as long as she was able. Wise words she\r\nspoke, and words ever to be remembered; but at last weakness overcame\r\nher, and her life was but a succession of gasps. One morning, after\r\nbeing unconscious for many hours, she opened her eyes wide and looked at\r\nus. She glanced from one to the other, and then, fixing her gaze on Mrs.\r\nSimmons, said:\r\n\r\n'Mary, I am glad--I am glad'--but she was too weak, she could not finish\r\nthe sentence. Again she essayed. We heard the words 'frightfully\r\nhomely,' but we could not catch the rest. The light faded from her eyes,\r\nand we thought we had seen the last expression of that wise and vigorous\r\nmind; but the next day the bright, conscious look came again into her\r\nface, but it gave no evidence of recognition, though ardent affection\r\nsought eagerly for it. For a moment she lay still, and then said, in a\r\nfeeble but distinct voice:\r\n\r\n'It is better to enter into life maimed and halt than, having two hands\r\nand two feet, to be cast into hell.' A half hour afterward she said\r\nsoftly, as if to herself:\r\n\r\n'The joy of my Lord.'\r\n\r\nThey were her last words. She relapsed into unconsciousness, and\r\nlingered till the dawn of the next day, when she went to join that\r\nglorious and still-increasing band of martyrs who have been found worthy\r\nto die for our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIMONY.\r\n\r\n  Thou hast diamonds and emeralds and greenbacks,\r\n    Thou hast more than a mortal can crave;\r\n  Thou canst make a big pile, yet be honest,\r\n    Contractor--oh, why wilt thou shave?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIONAL ODE.\r\n\r\nSUGGESTED BY THE PRESIDENT'S PROCLAMATION OF JANUARY 1, 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I.\r\n\r\n  Shine forth upon the earth,\r\n  Bright day of dedicated birth,\r\n    And breathe in thundering accents thy command!\r\n  A mighty nation's heart awake,\r\n  Her self-enwoven fetters shake,\r\n    And vivify the pulses of the land!\r\n        Arising from the past\r\n        With stormy clouds o'ercast,\r\n  And darkened by a long-enduring night,\r\n  The Future's child and Freedom's--seraph bright!\r\n  Arise great day, and legions of the free,\r\n  Beneath thy conquering flag, lead forth to victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n  II.\r\n\r\n  Great Freedom dead!

PHILIP, ON THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI.\r\n\r\n\r\nA complete history of the bombardment and subsequent surrender of Forts\r\nJackson and St. Philip, and of the brilliant passage of our fleet up the\r\nMississippi river, which resulted in the capitulation of New Orleans, is\r\nyet wanting, to afford the public a full comprehension of all the\r\nattendant circumstances, respecting which there appears to have been\r\nsome misunderstanding. The daring exploit of running by the forts must\r\nbe recorded as another evidence of the historic valor and coolness of\r\nthe American navy. No less renown will attach in future times to the\r\nbombardment of the forts by the mortar fleet, conducted as it was\r\nentirely on scientific principles, and proving the efficiency of\r\nmortars, when used with discretion and with a knowledge of the\r\nlocalities. The great destruction in the forts was only fully\r\nascertained after the surrender, and shows that the success of the\r\nfleet, in passing them safely, depended, in a great measure, upon the\r\ninability of greater resistance on the part of Fort Jackson.\r\n\r\nA number of vessels, comprising the 'Western Gulf Squadron,' were\r\ncommanded by comparatively young officers, and that very important\r\nbranch of the same, the mortar flotilla, was mostly under the individual\r\nguidance of captains (acting masters) selected from the merchant marine.\r\nIt became necessary for the navy department to select a\r\ncommander-in-chief (flag officer) and a commander for the mortar\r\nflotilla, possessed of such qualities as to manage and render effective\r\nthe various branches of this peculiar combination of armed vessels, as\r\nwell as to inspire confidence and give satisfaction to their respective\r\ncommands.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of Captain David G. Farragut as flag officer of the\r\nsquadron, was acknowledged as a judicious one. He was popular in his\r\nfleet, and has realized the expectations of the country. His personal\r\nbravery was demonstrated during the hazardous passage of the\r\nforts--while his ship was enveloped in flames, kindled from an opposing\r\nfire raft--by his dashing attack on the Chalmette forts near New\r\nOrleans, and his speedy reduction of the city.\r\n\r\nThe choice of a suitable commander for the mortar flotilla was less\r\ndifficult, inasmuch as this little fleet was a creation of the officer\r\nwho was chosen as its leader. David D. Porter, for gallantry and\r\ningenuity, for theoretical and practical seamanship, and for general\r\npopularity among the officers of his own rank and date, has no superior\r\nin the navy, and his appointment to this command was truly fortunate.\r\n\r\nThe squadron, after having rendezvoused at Key West and Ship Island,\r\narrived without any material detention, at the South West Pass of the\r\nMississippi. A want of acquaintance with the changes in the bar,\r\noccasioned probably by the sinking of four or five rafts, flatboats, and\r\nan old dry dock by the enemy, resulted in some delays, but the whole\r\nsquadron at length, with the exception of the frigate Colorado, got\r\nsafely over, and anchored twelve miles up the river at the head of the\r\npasses.\r\n\r\nThe efficiency of mortars, elevated permanently at forty-five degrees,\r\ndepends chiefly upon an accurate knowledge of the distance to the object\r\nto be fired upon. This distance determines the quantity of powder\r\nnecessary for the discharge, and the length of the fuses to be employed.\r\nCaptain Porter understood the impossibility of judging and estimating\r\ndistances and bearings correctly, particularly when the objects are for\r\nthe most part hidden from view, as was the case with the forts on the\r\nwooded and crooked Mississippi, and had therefore requested of the\r\ndepartment the aid of a party from the U. S. coast survey, and the writer\r\nof these notes had been detailed by Prof. A. D. Bache, the\r\nsuperintendent of that work. One acting assistant, two sub-assistants,\r\nand one aid were attached to the party, and the steam gunboat Sachem was\r\nplaced at their disposal. This vessel arrived in the Mississippi on the\r\n11th of April. Captain Porter at once requested Mr. Gerdes to furnish a\r\nreliable survey of several miles of the river, below and including the\r\nfortifications. In this service a number of gunboats belonging to the\r\nfleet and to the mortar flotilla accompanied the Sachem, partly to\r\nafford protection, and partly to draw the enemy's attention from the\r\noperations of the surveyors. Mr. Gerdes commenced work with his party on\r\nthe 13th of April, and continuing for five consecutive days, made a\r\nreliable map of the river and its shores from the 'Jump' to and\r\nincluding Forts Jackson and St. Philip, with their outworks and water\r\nbatteries; the hulks, supporting the chain across the river, and every\r\nsingular and distinguishable object along its banks. The survey was made\r\nby triangulation carried forward simultaneously on both sides of the\r\nriver. Two coast survey signals were found, the 'Jump telegraph post,'\r\nand 'Salt-work's chimney top,' of which the geodetic relations were\r\nknown, and the work was founded upon a base line connecting these two\r\npoints. Sub-assistant Oltmanns, and Mr. Bowie as aid, were detailed for\r\nthe west shore, Mr. Gerdes and acting assistant Harris taking the\r\neastern side, while sub-assistant Halter observed angles from permanent\r\nstations. The angular measurements were made with all kinds of\r\ninstruments found suitable to the locality. Only a few of the stations\r\nwere on solid ground, nearly all the shore being overflowed. Frequently\r\nthe members of the party were compelled to mount their instruments on\r\nthe chimney tops of dilapidated houses. In other places boats were run\r\nunder overhanging trees on the shore, in which signal flags were\r\nhoisted, and the angles measured below with sextants. It was very\r\nsatisfactory, however, that the last measurement determined (leading to\r\nthe flagstaff on St. Philip) agreed almost identically with the location\r\ngiven by the coast survey several years ago. It seemed to be a regular\r\noccupation of the garrison in the fort, to destroy, during the\r\nnight-time, the marks and signals which were left daily by the party;\r\nand for this reason, Mr. Gerdes caused numbered posts to be set in the\r\nriver banks, and screened with grass and reeds so that they could not be\r\nfound by the enemy in the dark. From these marks, which were separately\r\ndetermined, he was enabled to furnish to Captain Porter the distances\r\nand bearings, from almost any point on the river to the forts, and by\r\nthe resulting data the commander selected the positions for his mortar\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th day of April the mortar schooners were moved to their\r\ndesignated positions, and the exact distances and bearings of each\r\nvessel being ascertained from the map, were furnished to the respective\r\ncaptains. Then the bombardment fairly commenced, and was continued, with\r\nonly slight intermission, for six days. Twice Captain Porter ordered\r\nsome of the vessels to change their positions when he found localities\r\nthat would answer better; the coast survey party furnished the new data\r\nrequired. From the schooners, which were fastened to the trees on the\r\nriverside, none of the works of the enemy were visible, but the exact\r\nstation of each vessel and its distance and bearings from the forts had\r\nbeen ascertained from the chart. The mortars were accordingly charged\r\nand pointed and the fuses regulated. Thus the bombardment was conducted\r\nentirely upon theoretical principles, and as such with its results,\r\npresents perhaps a new feature in naval warfare. When the whole number\r\nof shells discharged from the flotilla is compared with those that fell\r\nand left their marks on the dry parts of Fort Jackson (to which must be\r\nadded, in the same ratio, all those falling in the submerged parts), the\r\nprecision of the firing appears truly remarkable, and must command our\r\nhighest admiration, particularly when we consider that every shot was\r\nfired upon a _computed_ aim.\r\n\r\nDuring the days of the bombardment, the exact damage done to the forts\r\ncould not be ascertained. A deserter from the garrison came to the fleet\r\nand stated that Jackson was a complete wreck, but his information was\r\nconsidered rather doubtful. After six days' firing, when the forts\r\nshowed no disposition to surrender, and when our stock of ammunition was\r\nconsiderably reduced, Captain Porter submitted to the flag officer a\r\nplan for passing with the fleet between the forts. The order to pass the\r\nforts was given on the 23d of April, and a favorable reference in this\r\norder was made to Captain Porter's plan. On the morning of the 24th of\r\nApril, at three o'clock, the fleet got under weigh. The steam gunboats\r\nof the flotilla ran up close to the western fort and engaged the water\r\nbattery and the rampart guns, and from the mortar vessels a shower of\r\nshells was thrown into the besieged work. This bombardment made it\r\nimpossible for the leaders of the enemy to keep their men on the\r\nramparts. Three times they broke, although they were twice driven back\r\nto their guns at the point of the bayonet. From Fort St. Philip a much\r\ngreater resistance was offered to the ships in their passage up between\r\nthe works, as that fort had not been (comparatively speaking) so\r\neffectively attacked, nor had it suffered previously nearly so much as\r\nthe other from the mortars of Captain Porter. That the resistance of\r\nJackson was much slighter on this occasion, is further demonstrated, by\r\nthe fact, that our ships received little injury from the port side (Fort\r\nJackson), while nearly all the shot holes were found to be on the\r\nstarboard, the Fort Philip side.\r\n\r\nAfter the fleet had thus passed the stronghold of the enemy, and\r\ndestroyed ten or twelve of his armed steamers, the famous ram 'Manassas'\r\namong them, Captain Farragut gallantly ascended the river, took and\r\noccupied the quarantine, where he paroled the garrison, and then\r\ncontinued his course for New Orleans. In the mean time, it had been\r\nascertained, that the iron-clad battery Louisiana, fourteen guns, and\r\ntwo or three other armed steamers of the enemy were still unharmed near\r\nthe forts, and it appeared therefore precarious, for Captain Porter to\r\nremain with his mortar schooners (all sailing vessels) quite unprotected\r\nand liable to momentary attack from such overpowering structures. He\r\nconsequently despatched them to the gulf, to watch and cut off in the\r\nrear all communication with the forts, while he remained with the few\r\nsteam gunboats of the flotilla, at the station occupied during the\r\nbombardment. The Sachem, commanded by Mr. Gerdes, he had sent east of\r\nFort St. Philip, to aid Major-General Butler in landing troops by the\r\nback bayou, leading to the quarantine. This duty was successfully\r\nexecuted by the coast survey party. They sounded the channel, and buoyed\r\nit out with lamps, and thus facilitated the landing of about one\r\nthousand five hundred soldiers during the night in boats and launches of\r\nthe transports.\r\n\r\nBy this time, flag officer Admiral Farragut had successfully silenced\r\nthe extensive batteries of Chalmette, and finally appeared with his\r\nfleet before New Orleans.\r\n\r\n  LIST of the Mortar Flotilla, attached to the\r\n  Western Gulf Squadron, under the command\r\n  of Com.

Duncan, he accepted terms\r\nfor the surrender of Forts Jackson and St. Philip to Commodore Porter.\r\nWhile negotiations were progressing on board the 'Harriet Lane,' between\r\nour own and the confederate officers, (that vessel, and the Westfield,\r\nClifton, Jackson, and Owasco, were at anchor between the two forts, each\r\ncarrying a large white flag at the masthead,) the leaders of the enemy's\r\nmarine forces set fire to the iron-clad battery Louisiana, cast her\r\nloose, and sent her adrift straight for our fleet. This dishonorable act\r\non the part of the enemy during a time of truce, and while their own\r\nofficers were in consultation with the commander of our forces, on board\r\nof a United States vessel, might have resulted in a very serious\r\ndisaster to us, had not the magazine of the Louisiana exploded before\r\nshe reached the fleet, which it did in full view of our vessels, and not\r\nfar off. This explosion was succeeded by a crash, presenting a scene\r\nsuch as has been rarely witnessed. After this fearful episode, the\r\ncapitulation was concluded, and both the forts, the garrison, the\r\narmament, ammunition, stock, and provisions, were formally surrendered\r\nto Commander Porter, of the mortar flotilla, and transferred by him, on\r\nthe next day, to Major-General Butler, commanding the United States army\r\nin the Department of the Gulf.\r\n\r\nMany contradictory opinions existed regarding the actual damage\r\ninflicted by the bombardment, as well as by the broadside fire of the\r\npassing fleet; and, Captain Porter desired Mr. Gerdes to make such a\r\nsurvey of Fort Jackson, as would settle all doubts touching the matter\r\nin question. Under his supervision, Acting Assistant Harris, aided by\r\nthe other members of his party, traced in their corresponding places on\r\nthe large existing detailed plan of the fort, all the injuries arising\r\nfrom the attack. Every hole in the ground, (whether caused by the mortar\r\nshells or round shot,) break in the walls, crack in the masonry, each\r\ngun dismantled or disabled, the burnt citadel, the hospital and\r\noutbuildings, the destroyed bridges and injured magazines, were noted by\r\nactual measurement.\r\n\r\nThe levees, which before the attack had kept the high water of the\r\nMississippi from entering the fort, were found destroyed in numerous\r\nplaces by bomb-shells. Much of the area of the fort was in consequence\r\noverflowed. The number of balls and shells which fell in the inundated\r\nparts, was estimated from the proportion found in the dry parts. In the\r\nplan, the submerged parts were distinctly marked, and it plainly shows,\r\nthat hardly one quarter of the whole area remained dry or above the\r\nlevel of the water.\r\n\r\nFrom this survey the following statistics are gathered:\r\n\r\n  1. Number of 13 in. shells fired\r\n  from the mortar flotilla that fell\r\n  on solid ground                            1,113\r\n\r\n  2. Number of shells purposely\r\n  exploded over the forts                    1,080\r\n\r\n  3. Number of shells that fell in\r\n  overflowed ground (computed)               3,339\r\n\r\n  4. Number of round shot visible\r\n  on dry ground fired from the\r\n  fleet and the gunboat of the\r\n  flotilla                                                            87\r\n\r\n  5. Number of round shot that\r\n  fell on overflowed ground\r\n  (computed)                                                         261\r\n\r\n  6. The total destruction of the citadel\r\n  of the forts, of the hospitals, the outbuildings,\r\n  the magazines, the bridges,\r\n  and of thirteen scows for use in the\r\n  moat.\r\n\r\n  7. The very severe injury to the ramparts,\r\n  particularly on the northwest side\r\n  to the casemates, all along the front,\r\n  (which were cracked from end to end,)\r\n  to the levees, which were completely\r\n  riddled, and to the works in general.\r\n  The demolition was so great, that the\r\n  shell holes in the ground left hardly\r\n  anywhere a free passage for walking.\r\n\r\nIt is further ascertained from this survey, that the armament of the\r\nfort consisted of fifty 32-pounders, seven columbiads, ten short guns,\r\nthree rifle guns, two brass field pieces, and three mortars, in all\r\nseventy-five guns.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following are extracts from Mr. Harris' report to Assistant Gerdes,\r\naccompanying the plan, which was published by the Navy Department:\r\n\r\n     'My informant, (an intelligent and reliable eyewitness,)\r\n     voluntarily gave the credit of reducing the forts to the bomb\r\n     fleet. The fort was so much shaken by this firing, that it was\r\n     feared the casemates would come down about their ears. The loss of\r\n     life by the bombs was not great, as they could see them coming\r\n     plainly, and avoid them, but the effect of their fall and explosion\r\n     no skill could avert.\r\n\r\n     'About one shell in twenty failed to explode; even those that fell\r\n     in the water going off. It is worth noticing, that the bombs that\r\n     fell in the ditches close to the walls of the fort and exploded\r\n     there, shook the fort much more severely, than any of those that\r\n     buried themselves in the soft ground.\r\n\r\n     'The fort was in perfect order when the bombardment commenced, the\r\n     dirt which now disfigures everything is the accumulation of a few\r\n     days. The water did not enter the fort until the levee had been\r\n     broken by the bombs; during the summer of 1861, when the\r\n     Mississippi was even higher, the parade ground remained entirely\r\n     dry.'\r\n\r\nThe above statistics and information show, that the surrender of the\r\nforts was caused by the terrific bombardment of the mortar fleet, a fact\r\nwhich should always remain identified with the brilliant achievements,\r\nthat ended in the recapture of the second commercial city of our\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASON, RHYME, AND RHYTHM.\r\n\r\n\r\n  All arts are one, howe'er distributed they stand,\r\n  Verse, tone, shape, color, form, are fingers on one hand.'\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION TO VOLUME FIRST.\r\n\r\nThe first volume of this work contains an inquiry into the principles of\r\nart, and an attempt to present a rational solution of the delight felt\r\nin the contemplation of Beauty. The related thoughts upon art and\r\nbeauty, found scattered almost at random over so many pages, and in so\r\nmany different tongues, have been brought together, and, closely linked\r\nin logical sequences, placed in such connections that they now mutually\r\nillustrate and corroborate one another. No longer drifting apart in the\r\nbewildering chaos of multitudinous pages, they now revolve round a\r\ncommon centre, the heart of all artistic beauty, through whose\r\nmanifestations alone it gains its power to charm the human soul: viz.,\r\n'the infinite attributes of the Author of all true Beauty.'\r\n\r\nThese thoughts on Art and Beauty have been carefully compiled,\r\ncondensed, and arranged from many writers of eminence: Tissandier,\r\nRuskin, Schlegel, etc., etc.; and are interwoven with much original\r\nmatter, placing their great truths in new relations, and developing\r\ntheir complex meanings. By working up _with them_ the thoughts suggested\r\n_by them_, the author has sedulously endeavored to form them into a\r\nwhole of higher power.\r\n\r\nThe first volume being devoted to the theory of art, an attempt has been\r\nmade in the second to bring the more general thoughts to a focus, and\r\nconcentrate their light upon the vexed and confused subject of\r\nversification. The second volume may indeed be considered as a 'Manual\r\nof Rhythm,' for the most _practical_ rules are given for its\r\nconstruction and criticism, and simple and natural solutions offered of\r\nits apparent irregularities and anomalies; while examples of sufficient\r\nlength are cited from our most musical poets to give just ideas of the\r\ncharacteristics and power of all the measures in use in English\r\nversification.\r\n\r\nThat the book may prove useful to the reader, is the earnest wish of the\r\nauthor!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLOVINGLY DEDICATED TO EUGENE B. COOK.\r\n\r\nWhen the busy little sailor bird builds himself a nest in which he--with\r\nhis mate and their tiny brood--may swing secure through the sudden\r\nstorms of fitful springs, and find shelter from the heats of summer,\r\nsewing it so tightly together that the rain cannot permeate it, nor the\r\nwild winds waft away the light beams and rafters of the swinging home,\r\nwe do not quarrel with the little architect because he has industriously\r\ngleaned such materials as were needed for his purpose, because he has\r\ntorn his leaves from the great forest book of nature. The leaves are\r\nfreely given by God, and the little builder has a natural right to play\r\nthe artist with them, if he can succeed in forming them into a _new\r\nwhole_, fitted for the maintenance of a higher order of life. Thus the\r\nthoughts of great men are the common heritage of humanity.\r\n\r\nOr, when we eat of the fragrant honey, we do not quarrel with the thymy\r\nbees because they have blended for us the sweets of Hybla. The flowers\r\nfrom which they were drawn are lovely and perfumed as before, but the\r\nworkers have made from them a _new whole_, in which the pilfered sweets\r\nhave gained a higher value from their perfect union. Those who prefer\r\nthe dewy juice as it exists in the plant, may use their own powers to\r\nextract it, for the bee has not injured the flowers, and they may still\r\nbe found blooming in the keen mountain air; but let those who may not\r\nscale the heights, nor work the strange transmutation, who yet love the\r\nfragrant honey, eat--blessing the little artist for his waxen cells and\r\nwinged labor.\r\n\r\nWho would quarrel with a friend because he had roamed through many a\r\nclime to find flowers for a wreath woven for our pleasure? Virgin Lilies\r\nfrom the still lakes of Wordsworth, Evergreens from the labyrinthine\r\nforests of Schlegel, Palm from the holy hills of Tissandier, Amaranth\r\nwith the breath of angels fresh upon it from the Paradise groves of\r\nRuskin, interwoven with Passion Flowers and Anemones of his own\r\nwilds,--shall we not acknowledge our wreath as a new whole, seeing that\r\nthe isolated fractions are raised to a higher power in becoming\r\nessential parts of a new unity?\r\n\r\nEugene, the wreath of Lilies, Evergreen, Palm, and Amaranth--the honey\r\nof Hybla--the many-leaved nest of the little architect, in which you may\r\nswing through the storms of the finite, into the deep and cloudless blue\r\nof the infinite,--are now before you!\r\n\r\nWill you not look up from the fleshless and skeleton perfection of the\r\nproblemed forms, which start at your slightest touch from the formal\r\nsquares of the chess board,--forms which confuse me with their\r\ncomplexity, bewilder me in the mazes of their ceaseless combinations,\r\ndazzle me with their chill erudition, and appal me with want of\r\nlife,--and smile acceptance on the glowing gifts here lovingly tendered\r\nyou?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCONTENTS OF VOLUME FIRST.\r\n\r\n  CHAP.

Such\r\nan analysis is necessary, as an introductory study, to the full and\r\ncomplete comprehension of any specific branch of art.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, every specific art has its own special theory,\r\ndesigned to teach the limits of its means, and the difficulties peculiar\r\nto the medium through which it is to manifest the Beautiful, with the\r\nvarious rules by which it must be regulated in its realization of the\r\nfundamental laws of Beauty.\r\n\r\nA clear, deep, and comprehensive view of the origin and nature of the\r\nFine Arts, is the work most needed by the readers and thinkers of the\r\npresent century. Some noble attempts have indeed been made in this\r\ndirection, but, valuable as such essays may be, they do not yet\r\ncorrespond to the growing, requisitions of the public mind. It is true\r\nsuch a work would be one of great difficulty, exacting immense stores of\r\ninformation, and highly cultivated tastes. The writer must possess the\r\nlogical power requisite for the most subtle analyses; he must have the\r\n_creative_ genius to combine the scattered facts of natural beauty, with\r\ntheir varied effects upon the human consciousness, into one great whole;\r\nwhile, at the same time, the tenderness and susceptibility of the\r\n_receptive_ genius must be equally developed in him. He should blend the\r\nloving and devout soul of a Fra Angelico with the logical acumen of a\r\nBacon. How seldom is the creative genius sufficiently tender and humble\r\nto be, in the full sense of the term, at the same time, _receptive_!\r\n\r\nAfter its treatment of the philosophical theory of Art, such a work\r\nshould also throw its light upon the special theories, and more general\r\nrules of specific arts; for such rules, when true, are never arbitrary,\r\nbut spring from the fundamental laws, of universal Beauty. They are but\r\nthe external manifestation, through material mediums, of eternal laws.\r\n\r\nThe compiler of the present article can offer no such great work to the\r\nreader. An earnest effort will however be made to bring together the\r\nrelated thoughts upon Art and Beauty. They are found scattered almost at\r\nrandom over so many pages; to link them together by arranging them in\r\ntheir logical sequences, placing them so that they will illustrate and\r\nmutually corroborate one another: and, working up with them the thoughts\r\nsuggested by them, the author has labored to form of them a compact and\r\neasily perused _whole._ For the ideas selected are _essentially\r\nrelated_, and, scattered as they may have hitherto been, naturally\r\ngravitate round a common centre. No longer drifting apart through the\r\nchaos of multitudinous pages, they are now formed into a system of\r\norder, a galaxy of which the central sun is--the Divine attributes as\r\nmanifested through the Beautiful.\r\n\r\nIf the writer shall succeed in suggesting to some lucid and\r\ncomprehensive mind the fact that a noble field for the culture of the\r\nhuman heart and soul remains almost unexplored, and induce one worthy of\r\nthe task to undertake its cultivation; or if her humble work shall\r\ninduce one lover of pure art to direct his attention to the glorious\r\npromises which it reveals to him of a closer communion with the Great\r\nArtist, the beneficent Creator of the Beautiful--she will feel herself\r\nmore than compensated for her 'pleasant labor of love.'\r\n\r\nAll true art is symbolic; a thought, an idea, must always constitute the\r\nsignificance, the soul of its outward form. The mere delusive\r\nimitations, the servile copyings of the actual shapes of reality, are\r\nnot the proper objects of art. To form a master work of art, the idea\r\nsymbolized must be pure and noble; the technical execution, faultless.\r\nNo heavier censure can, however, be passed upon an artist, than that he\r\npossesses only the technic or rhetoric of art, without having penetrated\r\nto its subtle essence of forming thought.\r\n\r\nMan is chiefly taught through _symbolism_. Living in a symbolic world of\r\nsensuous emblems, he seeks in them a substitute for the wondrous powers\r\nof immediate cognition which he lost in his fall. His highest\r\ndestination is _symbolical_, for is he not made in the Divine image?\r\nThrough the symbolism of the matter is the soul taught its first lessons\r\nin the school of life: when it is known and felt that nature is but the\r\nsymbol of the Great Spirit, the instinct of our own immortality awakes.\r\nIn the Old Covenant, the twilight of faith was studded with the starry\r\nsplendor of a marvellous symbolism; and the new era of the ascending and\r\never-brightening dawn still bears on its front the glittering morning\r\nstar of symbolic Christian art.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding its earthly intermixture, however it may have wandered\r\nfrom its true source, however sensuous and worthless it may have become,\r\nart, in its essence, is still divine. Men devoted to the pursuit of mere\r\nmaterial well being, have been too long in the habit of regarding poetry\r\nand the arts as mere recreations, to be taken up at spare moments,\r\npursued when we have nothing better to do; as a relief for the ennui of\r\nidleness, or an ornament for the centre table; without remembering how\r\nmany good and great men have given up their whole lives to its\r\nadvancement; without considering into how many hearts it has borne its\r\nsoothing lessons of faith and love.\r\n\r\nMen look upon art as if it were to be pursued merely for the sake of\r\nart, for the egotistic pleasure of the artist, and not as a moral power\r\nfull of responsibility and dignity. We might as well suppose that\r\nscience is to be pursued merely for the sake of science, that we are to\r\nthink only that we may think. But while everything has its determinate\r\nend in the lower world of matter, concurring in its degree to the life\r\nof the whole; can there exist faculties and tendencies without aim in\r\nthe soul; permanent, regular, and general facts without a final cause?\r\nCan art exist as an accidental fact in the bosom of society? Is it not\r\nrather an important means for the development of the finer feelings of\r\nthe heart, the higher faculties of the soul?\r\n\r\nMan was created 'to glorify God and enjoy him forever,' says the\r\nelementary catechism of the sternest of all creeds. Anything, therefore,\r\nwhich sets before us more preëminently the glory of God, thus placing\r\nmore vividly before us the only source of all true enjoyment, must be,\r\nin the highest sense of the word, useful to us, as enabling us to fulfil\r\nthe very end of our creation. Things that only help us to draw material\r\nbreath, are only useful to us in a secondary sense: if they alone are\r\nthought of, they are worse than useless; for it would be better we\r\nshould not exist at all, than that we should guiltily disappoint the\r\npurposes of our existence. Yet men in this material age speak as if\r\nhouses and lands, food and raiment, were alone useful; as if the open\r\neye and loving appreciation of all that He hath made were quite\r\nprofitless; as if the meat were more than the life, the raiment than the\r\nbody. They look upon the earth as a stable, its fruit as mere fodder,\r\nloving the corn they grind and the grapes they crush better than the\r\ngardens of the angels upon the slopes of Eden, so that the woe of the\r\nPreacher has fallen upon us: 'Though God has made everything beautiful\r\nin his time, also He hath set the world in their heart, so that no man\r\ncan find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.'\r\n\r\n            'The age culls simples.\r\n    With a broad clown's back turned broadly to the glory of the stars;\r\n  We are gods by our own reck'ning, and may well shut up our temples--\r\n    And wield on, amid the incense steam, the thunder of our cars.\r\n\r\n  'For we throw out acclamations of self-thanking, self-admiring,\r\n    With, at every mile run faster, 'Oh, the wondrous, wondrous age,'\r\n  Little thinking if we work our souls as nobly as our iron,\r\n    Or if angels will commend us at the goal of pilgrimage.'\r\n\r\nUtility has a nobler sense than a mere ministering to our physical\r\nwants, a mere catering to our sense of luxury. Geology is surely higher\r\nwhen refleshing the dry bones and revealing to us the mysteries of a\r\nlost creation, than when tracing veins of lead and beds of iron;\r\nastronomy, when opening the houses of heaven for us, than when teaching\r\nus the laws of navigation. That these things are useful to us in a lower\r\nsense, is God's merciful condescension to the wants of our material\r\nlife;--that we may discern their eternal beauty, and so glorify their\r\nMaker in the enjoyment of His attributes, is an earnest, even here, of\r\nour blissful immortality.\r\n\r\nIf art has frequently fallen from its high mission, if it has often\r\nfailed to incarnate the divine ideas from which all its glories must\r\nflow, it must be attributed in part to the artists themselves; in part\r\nto the public for whom they labor, and whom they too often seek only to\r\namuse. They clutch at the ephemeral bouquets of the passing passions of\r\na day, not caring to wait for the unfading crowns of amaranth. If the\r\nartist will stoop to linger in the Circean hall of the senses, he must\r\nnot be astonished if good and earnest men should reproach him with the\r\ntriviality of a misspent and egotistic life.\r\n\r\nIf we should pause and examine into the reasons for the different\r\nestimation in which art is held by different persons, we should find\r\nthem in the various definitions of the Beautiful which would be offered\r\nus by the individuals in question. Let us linger for a moment to examine\r\nsuch definitions.\r\n\r\nOne class of men would tell us that the Beautiful is that which is\r\nagreeable to the senses of sight and hearing. They would admire, in\r\npainting, the delineation of naked flesh, luxuriant as it glows upon the\r\ncanvas of Vandyke and Rubens; in statuary, they would seek voluptuous\r\nand sensual positions; while in music, they would love that which\r\ntitillates the ear, which lulls them into an indolent yet delicious\r\nlanguor. Such men are the dwellers in the halls of Circean senses; they\r\ncan appreciate only the sensuous. The poets of this class are very\r\nnumerous. They never rise to those general ideas which are found in the\r\nuniversal consciousness, but are forever occupied with fugitive\r\nthoughts, passing as the hour in which they are born. They delight in\r\nrepresenting the _accidental_, the exceptional, the peculiar, the\r\nfashion, mode, or exaggeration of the flying hour. They never sing of\r\nthe high and tender feelings which pervade the human heart; of the joys\r\nand sorrows of the soul in its mystic relations with God, its\r\nsympathetic affections with humanity; but delight in describing furtive\r\nsensations, passing impressions, individual and subjective bliss and\r\nwoe. Never daring to grapple with the sublime yet tender simplicity of\r\nnature, they sport with eccentricity, delight in fantastically related\r\nideas, revel in surprises, in sudden and unforeseen developments. Their\r\nstyle is full of individualities and mannerisms, ornaments and\r\nintricacies; the _coloring_ is always worth more than the _form_, the\r\nsensation than the idea. Their heroes and heroines are grotesque beings,\r\nsentimental caricatures, souls not to be comprehended, always placed in\r\nunnatural situations, and surrounded with dark, gloomy, and impenetrable\r\nmysteries. If their readers can be made to exclaim at every page:\r\n'Inconceivable! astonishing! original!' they consider their work\r\nperfect. Such poets seldom attempt long poems; if they should\r\nimprudently do so, we find but little sequence, and nothing of that\r\nclear order, of that marvellous _unity_, which mark the works of the\r\nmasters. Everything is sought to flatter that pretentious vanity of the\r\nlimited understanding which piques itself on its stereotyped knowledge,\r\nalways striving to usurp the higher empire of the divining soul. Such\r\nwriting certainly requires subtlety of intellect, for talent is required\r\nto discover that which no one can see; to invent relations where none\r\nexist. We may, indeed, often observe great perfection in the details,\r\nhigh finish in the execution, keen intellect in the analysis; but\r\nnothing in the thoughts which appeals to the universal heart. Brilliant\r\npictures succeed to brilliant pictures, decoration to decoration, but\r\nthere is an utter want of essential unity. Absorbed in the sensuous\r\ngorgeousness of highly colored details, if they can but glue together\r\nstartling and overwrought images, they are satisfied, even while\r\nneglecting the principal idea. They seize everything by the outside;\r\nnothing by the heart.\r\n\r\nThe painters of this class give us glaring colors and violent contrasts;\r\nthe musicians, antitheses, concetti, ingenious combinations, _tours de\r\nforce_, rather than flowing melodies or profound harmonies. The power\r\nthey _wish_, to possess spoils that they _really have_; all _true_\r\ninspiration abandons the hopeless artist in the midst of his ingenious\r\nsubtleties; it flies before his fantastic conceits; laughs at the\r\nfollies of his prurient fancies; and withdraws its solemn light from the\r\nvain and presumptuous intellect, doting ever over its own fancied\r\nsuperiority. Inspiration, that holy light only vouchsafed to the loving\r\nsoul, speaks to man in the silence of the subjective intellect. If the\r\nheart is tossed by a thousand passing and selfish passions, how can its\r\nsolemn but simple and tender voice be heard? Suffering such inflated\r\nspirits to plume themselves upon the transitory admiration they are\r\nalways sure of obtaining, it allows them to take the evil for the good;\r\nthe grotesque for the beautiful; the meteors of vanity for the heaven\r\nstars of truth.\r\n\r\nSuch artists love not the mighty arches of gothic architecture, in whose\r\nvast curves and dim recesses lurks the mystic idea of the infinite; they\r\ntake no interest in the ascetic faces which the old masters loved to\r\npicture, worn into deep furrows of care by penitence and holy sorrow,\r\nthough lighted with the triple ray of Faith, Hope, and Love. They have\r\nno sympathies with the saints and heroes who have been great through\r\nself-abnegation, for such lives are a constant reproach to their own\r\nsybaritical tendencies. Constantly mistaking the effervescence of\r\npassion for the fire of genius; viewing the sublime realities of\r\nreligion only as fantastic dreams; seeing nothing but the gloom of the\r\ngrave beyond the fleeting shadows of the present life; granting reality\r\nto nothing but that which is essentially variable, phenomenal, and\r\ncontingent; forever revelling in the luxuriousness of mere\r\nsensation--they understand only that which can be seen and handled. But\r\nthe devotion to the True in art is a disinterested worship--a worship\r\nrequiring the most heroic self--abnegation; for the love of fame, of\r\nself, of pleasure, will so bewilder and confuse the artist, that he will\r\nnever be able to sound the depths of any art. And now, can we wonder if\r\npure and earnest men utterly refuse to acknowledge the dignity and worth\r\nof art, when manifested to them through the works of fantastically\r\nsensuous, or voluptuously sensual artists? This misconception of the\r\ntrue aim of art, of the meaning of the Beautiful--with its natural\r\nconsequence, merely sensuous manifestations of Beauty through the medium\r\nof different arts--has been one of the causes of the violent and\r\ninveterate prejudices which have arisen against art itself in the minds\r\nof many good men; and, were this view of beauty and art the true one, we\r\ncould not deny that such prejudices or opinions would be but too well\r\nfounded. To combat such debasing and false views of the aims of art,\r\nwill be the chief object of the present volume. If art were to be\r\ndegraded into the servant and minister of the senses, we would be among\r\nthe first to condemn it. But all Beauty proceeds from the All Fair, who\r\nhath pronounced all 'good,' and 'loveth all that He hath made.'\r\n\r\nLeaving the 'men of the senses' in their Circean sleep, we proceed to\r\nquestion the 'men of the schools' with regard to their conception of\r\nart, their definition of the Beautiful. Erudite as they may be, their\r\nresponse to our question is scarcely more satisfactory. The Beautiful,\r\nin their estimation, is but the realization of _known rules_, fixed and\r\nsanctioned by long usage. Such men are the connoisseurs in art, the\r\nstudents of manuals, who are familiar with all the acknowledged _chefs\r\nd'oeuvre_, and all the possible resources of art; they have traced for\r\ngenius itself the path in which it must walk, and will accept none as\r\ntrue artists who wander from it. They are not ashamed to take a poet\r\nsuch as Shakespeare, to compare his wonderful creations with the rules\r\nthey have acquired with so much labor, and, seeking in his living dramas\r\nonly the application of the principles with which _they_ are familiar,\r\nscruple not to condemn the immortal works of the greatest of all\r\nuninspired writers. Madame de Staël truly says: 'Those who believe\r\nthemselves qualified to pronounce sentence upon the Beautiful, have more\r\nvanity than those who believe they possess genius.' Taste in the fine\r\narts, like fashion in society, is indeed considered as a proof of\r\n_haut-ton_, a claim to fashionable and personal distinction.\r\nShould a man of the most cultivated mind and soul, venture to pronounce a\r\njudgment upon the character of some great architectural work,\r\nwithout being versed in the terms and technics of scientific\r\narchitecture--remark with what profound contempt his opinion on its\r\neffect will be received by the pompous men of the schools! Or, let him\r\nventure to take pleasure in a musical composition not approved by the\r\nmusical savants, in which they have detected various crimes against the\r\nlaws of harmony, the fixed rules of counter point--and behold the men of\r\nthe schools, how they will shrug their classic shoulders in contempt at\r\nhis name and besotted ignorance! Or, should he venture to delight in the\r\noriginal and naive lyrics of some untaught bard of nature, without being\r\nable to justify his admiration by learned citations from Virgil and\r\nHorace, to say nothing of the categories of Aristotle--he is considered\r\nas an ignoramus, who might possibly impose upon those ignorant as\r\nhimself, but who should at least have the modesty to yield up at once\r\nhis opinion to the conclusive decisions of the great literary pundits!\r\nIn vain may he assert that such and such a passage is touching and\r\nnoble; in vain, may he say it has appealed to his inmost soul, and\r\nawakened deep and holy emotions, that it has made him a better man;--the\r\nsame wise shrug of contempt greets him; he is told 'such effects are\r\nimpossible, for the work in question offends a fixed rule!'\r\n\r\nYet what great diversity of opinion obtains among the very band of\r\nself-constituted elect! How few possess the requisite mastery of the\r\nrules, and what an immense number of the human race would thus be\r\nexcluded from the elevating sources of enjoyment to be found in poetry\r\nand the fine arts! Such scholastic critics confound two things to be\r\ndistinguished in every work in all branches of art; viz., the _pure\r\nidea_, and the _material form_ through which it is manifested. It is\r\nindeed necessary that the artist should make severe studies, and\r\nthoroughly master the technics of his chosen art, whatever it may be;\r\nfor, as means to facilitate the clearest manifestation of his\r\nconceptions, such formulæ are of immense importance;--but an erudite\r\nacquaintance with the technics of art is not necessary for the\r\ncomprehension of the _idea_, manifested; for the _idea_ itself is ever\r\nwithin the range of the human intellect, and the soul may always\r\nconsider the thought of the soul, when appropriately manifested, _face\r\nto face_. 'Imbibe not your opinions from professional artists,' says\r\nDiderot; 'they always prefer the difficult to the beautiful!'\r\n\r\nArtistic judgment is, indeed, too apt to be satisfied with correct\r\ndrawing and harmony of colors; harmony and keeping of plastic forms;\r\nharmony of tones; harmony of thoughts in relation to one another;\r\nwithout considering that to these necessary harmonies two more,\r\nprimarily essential, must be added: harmony of thought with the eternal,\r\nwith the divine attributes of truth, infinity, unity, and love; and\r\nharmony of expression with what ought to be--which is indeed to assert\r\nthat true Beauty is neither sensuous nor scholastic, but vitally and\r\nessentially moral. True Beauty lingers not in the soft halls of the\r\nCircean senses; it wanders not in the trim paths, beaten walks, or dusty\r\nhighways of the schools, though the artist must indeed be familiar with\r\nall the intricacies of their windings, that he may there master the laws\r\nand proportions of the form through which he is to manifest the supernal\r\nessence through our senses to our souls; it dwells above, too high to be\r\ndegraded by our low sensualism, too ethereal to lose its sweet freedom\r\nin the logically woven links of our scholastic trammels. 'Ye shall know\r\nthe _truth_, and it shall make you free,' is a proposition not only of\r\nmoral, but of universal artistic application.\r\n\r\nDisgusted by the idle pretensions and stilted pedantry of the men of the\r\nschools, can we wonder if good and earnest men still refuse to\r\nacknowledge the high worth and dignity of art, which, in accordance with\r\nsuch definitions, would be nothing but a manifestation and studied\r\napplication of the rules and laws of the limited and pedantic human\r\nunderstanding? To prove art essentially _moral_, in exact correspondence\r\nwith the triune being of man addressing itself _through_ his senses, in\r\naccordance with the requisitions of his understanding, _to_ his\r\nsoul--and that it is only delightful to the soul created for the\r\nenjoyment of God, in so far as it is successful in manifesting or\r\nsuggesting some portion of the Divine attributes--are the chief objects\r\nof the book here offered to the reader. If art were indeed to be\r\ndegraded into nothing higher than the exponent or incarnation of the\r\nlogical data and rigid formulæ of the limited understanding of man, the\r\nwriter would be frozen to death in the attempt to plant its chilling\r\nbanner. She too would regard it but as a solemn trifling with time and\r\nthe fearful responsibilities of eternity.\r\n\r\nHaving failed to obtain any elevated or satisfactory definition of Art\r\nand Beauty from the men of the senses, or the men of the schools; as the\r\nsupporters of a government founded upon a belief in the virtues of the\r\npeople, we turn to them in our despair to ask for deeper insight into\r\nthese important subjects. Alas! they are as yet too busy and too\r\nignorant to formulate for us a definite reply! But from them must come\r\nthe sibylline response, for the true artist has no home upon earth save\r\nthe heart of humanity! The kingdom of the Beautiful belongs not\r\nexclusively to the luxurious, nor to any aristocracy of the refined and\r\ncultivated, but, like the blue depths of God's heaven arch, spans the\r\nworld, everywhere visible, and everywhere beneficent!\r\n\r\nAs they may not formulate for us a definite reply, let us place our ears\r\nclose to the throbbing heart of the masses, that we may hear what effect\r\nthe Beautiful, as manifested in art, has upon the electric pulses. And\r\nnow our despair passes forever, for men made in the image of God, when\r\nnot degraded by a corrupting materialism, nor lost in the bewildering\r\nmazes of a luxurious sensualism, nor puffed up with the vain conceit of\r\nthe limited understanding, and thus holding themselves above all the\r\nhigh enthusiasm and holy mysteries of art, always seem able to recognize\r\nthat which awakens in them noble thoughts or tender feelings; so that\r\nwhen a poet sings to them of heroism, of liberty, of fraternity, of\r\njustice, of love, of home, of God, if he can succeed in causing their\r\nhearts to throb with generous emotions, they stop not to consult the\r\ncritics, they listen only to the voice of their own naive souls, and at\r\nonce and with one accord enthusiastically cry: 'Beautiful! beautiful!\r\nhow beautiful!' La Bruyère himself says: 'When a poem elevates your\r\nmind, when it inspires you with noble and heroic feeling, it is\r\naltogether useless to seek other rules by which to judge it; it is--it\r\nmust be good, and the work of a true artist.' Such is really the\r\ncriterion consulted by the people, and on this broad and just base rests\r\nthe general correctness of their judgments.\r\n\r\nUncultured as they may be, is it not, indeed, among the people that we\r\nsee the most vivid sympathies with the really great artists, the true\r\npoets? It is among them we most frequently find that glowing enthusiasm\r\nwhich excites and transports them until they lose all selfish thoughts;\r\ncontrasting strongly with the measured calm, the still and prudent\r\nreserve of the elite, the connoisseurs, which an impassioned artist\r\n(Liszt) truly says 'is like the glacés on their own tables.' Let the\r\nartist but strike some of the simple but sublime chords which, the\r\nCreator has tuned to the same harmony in human bosoms, and they will\r\nrespond from the heart of the people in an instantaneous thrill of noble\r\ninstincts and generous emotions. It is ever with the people that the\r\nartist meets with that profound and _loving_ admiration which so greatly\r\nincreases his own powers, and which always leads them to noble acts of\r\ndevotion for those who have succeeded in touching the harmonizing chords\r\nvibrating through the mighty bosom of humanity made in the image of God!\r\n\r\nIf we would learn something of the effect of art on the soul, and\r\nunderstand the secrets of its power, we should go to a representation of\r\none of Shakspeare's tragedies, and mark the attentive crowd silently\r\ncontemplating the high scenes which the poet unrolls before them.\r\nImmersed in poverty and suffering as they may themselves be, we will see\r\nthat at the words 'glory, honor, liberty, patriotism, love'; at the\r\nsight of the courageous struggle of the just against the unjust; at the\r\nfall of the wicked, the triumph of the innocent,--the furrowed and\r\nrugged faces glow with sympathy, all hearts proclaim the loveliness of\r\nvirtue, or are unanimous in the condemnation of vice. Full of just\r\nindignation against the aggressor, of generous sympathy with the\r\noppressed, shall the palpitating throng stay the quick throbbing of\r\ntheir hearts to inquire of the men of the senses if they may _admire_,\r\nor of the critics and schoolmen if they may _approve_? Their intuitions\r\nhave already decided the question for them. Why do the masses always\r\naccord in their estimation of the just and unjust? why do they always\r\nagree about glory and shame, vice and virtue, courage and cowardice? why\r\ndo they always find Beauty in the success of suffering virtue, the\r\ntriumph of oppressed innocence, the rescue of the wronged and helpless?\r\nThe answer throws its light over the whole world of art: Because God's\r\njustice, even when it condemns themselves, is one of the Divine\r\nattributes for whose enjoyment they were created; because it stands\r\npledged that whatever may be the disorder visible upon earth, it will\r\nrule in awful majesty over the final ordering of all things. The soul,\r\nurged on by an unconscious yet imperative thirst for the Absolute,\r\nhaving in vain tried to find its realization in a world furrowed by\r\nvanities and scared by vices, takes its flight to the clime of the\r\nideal, to find there the growth of eternal realities. The poet builds\r\nideal worlds in which he strives to find the absolute, adorning them\r\nwith all the beauties for which the human heart pines: heroism,\r\npatriotism, devotion, love, take form and find appropriate expression;\r\nfor all is wisdom, power, liberty, and harmony in the artistic realms.\r\nArt is a celestial vision which God sends to his exiled children, to\r\ngive them news of the invisible world for which they were created, to\r\nsoothe their sorrows, to turn their thoughts and affections to their\r\ntrue centre. Art is the transient realization, the momentary possession\r\nof the desires of the soul!\r\n\r\nThere is then a Beauty inaccessible to the senses, above the narrow\r\nlimit of technical laws, which a simple and uncorrupted people\r\nintuitively feel and love, for which the masses reserve their most\r\nprofound admiration, and which it is unquestionably the province of the\r\ntrue artist to manifest through whatever medium he may have chosen as\r\nhis specific branch of art. The delight felt in the Beautiful arises\r\nfrom the fact that it manifests or suggests, in a greater or less\r\ndegree, some portion of the Divine attributes for whose enjoyment we\r\nwere created. Is it not then time that the good and earnest men of our\r\nown broad land should cease to ignore, if not to persecute, art; should\r\nindeed reverently pause to inquire into the resources and capabilities\r\nof the mighty symbolism used and wielded by the fine arts?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VALUE OF THE UNION.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nWe are engaged in a life-and-death struggle for our national\r\nexistence--for the preservation of the Union, for these are synonymous.\r\nTo succeed, we need an animating spirit that shall carry us through all\r\nobstacles; that shall smile at repeated defeat; that shall ever buoy us\r\nup with strong hope and confidence in the ultimate success of our\r\nefforts. Such a spirit cannot flow from a simple love of opposition,\r\nexcited by the wicked bravado of our opponents; nor from a desire to\r\nprove ourselves the stronger: neither can it flow from the mere wish to\r\ndestroy slavery. None of these motives singly, nor all of them combined,\r\nare sufficient to sustain us in this hour of trial, or to carry us clear\r\nthrough to the desired goal. The only motive which can do this, and\r\nwhich, in the heart of every loyal man, should be of such large\r\nproportions as immensely to dwarf all lower ones, is one that can flow\r\nonly from a clear comprehension of the value of the Union, coupled with\r\na conviction, arising out of this intelligent valuation, that the Union,\r\nbeing what it is--containing within itself untold, and yet undeveloped\r\nblessings to ourselves and to the human race at large--is nothing less\r\nthan a most precious gift of God; given into our charge, to be ours as\r\nlong as we deserve its enjoyment by our individual and national\r\nadherence to truth and right; a conviction also, that our Union, from\r\nthe very marked Providential circumstances attending its establishment,\r\nis in no small sense a divine work; and hence, that we may rest in the\r\nsure hope that God will not permit His own work to be destroyed, except\r\nby our refusing to coöperate with Him in its preservation.\r\n\r\nAll our blessings, natural and spiritual, are enjoyed by us only in the\r\ndegree of our free and voluntary coöperation with the intentions of the\r\nDivine Giver. No good thing is forced upon us, and nothing that we ought\r\nto have is withheld if we put forth the power granted us to obtain it.\r\nThe atmosphere surrounds us, but the lungs must open and expand to\r\nreceive it. The food is before us, but the mouth must open, and the\r\nhands convey it thither, or it is of no service. Light flows from the\r\nsun, but the eye must open to enjoy it. And so with the blessings which\r\nwe enjoy in the Union; we must use our active powers to profit by them;\r\nand at this crisis we must not only act to enjoy them, but must strain\r\nevery nerve to preserve them. The nation is now on its trial, to be\r\ntested, as to whether it adequately values the divine gift of the Union.\r\nIf it does thus value it, it will use diligently and carefully all the\r\nabundant resources which lie around it and within it, like an\r\natmosphere--wealth, population, energy, intelligence, mechanical\r\ningenuity, scientific skill, and all the needed _materièl_ of warfare.\r\nIt is rich in all this, far more so than the South. All this, Providence\r\nlays at the feet of the nation. It can do no more. The nation, as one\r\nman, must now do _its_ part, or continue to do as it has done; it must\r\ncoöperate, must put forth a determined _will_--a will tenfold more\r\nresolute, more fixed and immovable to preserve the Union, than is that\r\nof its enemies to destroy it. This will cannot exist without a clear,\r\nintellectual appreciation of the worth of the Union; of its value as an\r\nagent, which, if rightly employed, will continue to develop increasing\r\npower to humanize and Christianize men, and to elevate, to broaden, and\r\nintensify human life and happiness more than any form of political\r\ninstitution that the world has ever witnessed.\r\n\r\nFull of this conviction, we shall then, individually and collectively,\r\nbe resolved that this noble continent, stretching three thousand miles\r\nfrom ocean to ocean, and opened like a new world to man, just at an\r\nepoch when religious and political liberty, starting into life in\r\nEurope, might be transplanted into this virgin soil, where thus far they\r\nhave developed into this fair republic--we shall then be resolved that\r\nthis broad, rich territory shall be forever devoted\r\n\r\n  To man's development--not to his\r\n    debasement.\r\n\r\n  To liberty and free order--not despotism\r\n    and forced order.\r\n\r\n  To an ever-advancing civilization--not\r\n    to a retrograding barbarism.\r\n\r\n  To popular self-government--not to\r\n    the rule of a slave-holding oligarchy.\r\n\r\n  To religion, education, and morality--not\r\n    to irreligion, ignorance, and\r\n    licentiousness.\r\n\r\n  To educated and dignified labor--not\r\n    to brutalized labor under the lash.\r\n\r\n  To individual independence and\r\n    equal rights--not to individual\r\n    subjugation to caste.\r\n\r\n  To peace--and not to border wars between\r\n    conflicting States.\r\n\r\n  To unity, harmony, and national\r\n    strength--not to disunity, civil discord,\r\n    and subjection to foreign\r\n    powers.\r\n\r\nAll these blessings on the one hand are guaranteed in the Union, and\r\nonly there--all their opposite horrors are involved as inevitably and\r\ncertainly in the Southern lunacy, resting on slavery and secession as\r\nits corner stones! Madness most unparalleled!\r\n\r\nWe will look now at a singular and beautiful fact--for fact it is,\r\naccount for it as we may. It is this: The course of civilization upon\r\nthis globe has apparently followed the course of the sun. Sunlight and\r\nwarmth travel from east to west. The moral and intellectual illumination\r\nof the nations has travelled the same route. From central or farther\r\nAsia, it goes to Assyria, and successively to Egypt, to Greece--thence\r\nto Italy and Rome--then to western Europe, England, France, Spain. From\r\nthence it leaps the Atlantic. The Bible, church, and school house, with\r\nthe Pilgrims and other colonies, scatter the primeval darkness and\r\nsavagism from the Atlantic coast. Still 'westward the march of empire\r\ntakes its way' to the Alleghanies, to the Mississippi; thence, by\r\nanother leap, across two thousand miles of continent, where it sparkles\r\nwith a golden lustre on the queenly California, enthroned upon the\r\nfar-off Pacific shore (yet by the miraculous telegraph within whispering\r\ndistance). There the newest and highest civilization comes face to face\r\nwith the oldest on the earth--hoary with ages; greets it in China across\r\nthe wide Pacific, and the circle of the globe is joined.\r\n\r\nNow the civilization inaugurated upon our continent, in these United\r\nStates, may be said to be, indeed is, the result of all that have\r\npreceded it. It combines somewhat of the elements of all the\r\ncivilizations that have been strung along the earth's eastern\r\nsemi-circumference, besides others, peculiar to itself. And why should\r\nit not be considered as the bud and opening flower growing out of the\r\nsummit of all the past, and for which the long ages have made toilsome\r\npreparation. Long time does it take for stem and leaves to unfold, but\r\nin the end comes the flower, and then the fruit. But here, in this bud\r\nof splendid promise, the American Union, lurks the foul worm of slavery,\r\nthreatening to blast the fondest hopes of mankind by destroying this\r\nglorious augury of a mature civilization, where man shall develop into\r\nthe full earthly stature of a being created in the divine image. Shall\r\nit be? Not if the North is faithful to God, to mankind, and to itself.\r\n\r\nLet us take courage. The westward-travelling sunbeams have ever to\r\noppose the western darkness, but they conquer always. So American\r\ncivilization, also, has its darkness and barbaric elements to battle\r\nwith, but they too, God willing, shall vanish before it.\r\n\r\nWhy have we been forced into this desperate, unexpected conflict? One\r\nreason may possibly be, that by it, we may be aroused to a living sense\r\nof the great value of our inheritance, the Union, when threatened with\r\nits loss. 'Blessings brighten as they take their flight.' Benefit's\r\ndaily enjoyed, with hardly a care or effort on our part, are not prized\r\nas they should be. When, however, we are threatened with their loss, we\r\nawaken from indifference. A new sense of their value springs up, and a\r\nsevere contest for their preservation stamps their true worth indelibly\r\non the heart. Threaten to cut off the air a man breathes, the food and\r\ndrink that sustains him, and you rouse all his energies into new life;\r\nand he now prizes these common but unthought-of blessings as he never\r\ndid before. And so it will be one effect of this contest, to arouse us\r\nas a nation to see clearly our vantage ground in the world's progress,\r\nand to stir us up as individuals, to lead higher and truer lives, each\r\nfor his own and for his country's sake. And when this Southern insane\r\nwickedness is quelled, and the great American nation can rest and\r\nbreathe freely once more, it will then calmly ponder the past, and\r\nsurvey the future. In the degree of its religion and virtue, and next of\r\nits intelligence and energy, it will, in the course of time, clearly\r\nperceive and wisely inaugurate a new social and industrial life, which\r\nwill be as far in advance of the present system of free labor as the\r\nlatter is itself in advance of slavery. What that is, cannot here be\r\nstated. It will, however, be but the inevitable result of agencies and\r\ninfluences now at work, and only interrupted and endangered by this\r\npro-slavery rebellion.\r\n\r\nWith these remarks, we enter upon our topic: 'Why is the Union\r\npriceless?'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons, among others, why it is so, upon which we shall\r\ndwell at some length.\r\n\r\nThe first is involved in the great fact that such is man's nature as\r\nbestowed by the Creator, that only in the society of his fellows can\r\nthat nature be developed into all its grandeur, and thus bestow and\r\nreceive the utmost amount of happiness. The old adage, 'the more, the\r\nmerrier,' might be truly amplified in many ways. When numbers are\r\nengaged in common pursuits, common interests, common views, common\r\njoys--each one zealous, earnest, life-giving and life-receiving--the\r\nhappiness of the whole flows in upon each, and multiplies it a\r\nthousandfold.\r\n\r\nNow if we look at history, keeping in mind the fact that the sole end of\r\nthe Creator is the happiness of his creatures, and that this happiness\r\nis multiplied in proportion to the number of those who can be brought\r\ninto accord and concert of action (and action, too, as diversified as\r\npossible)--looking at history, we say, under the light of this fact, it\r\nwould seem as if Providence, in the course of human events, was in the\r\ncontinual effort, so to speak, to bring mankind into ever closer, more\r\nharmonious, and more multiplied and diverse relations; ever striving to\r\nmass the human race more and more into larger and larger communities;\r\nthe different portions of which should still retain all the freedom they\r\nwere prepared for, or needed to enjoy, while at the same time, they were\r\nin close but free membership with the common body and its central head.\r\n\r\nWe say that this seems to be the aim of Providence; while on the other\r\nhand, there is just as evidently to be seen the working of an opposing\r\nforce, viz., human selfishness, human ignorance, individual ambition,\r\never seeking its own at the expense of others. A selfish, energetic,\r\nand ignorant spirit of individualism (as distinguished from an\r\nenlightened, large-minded, _social_ individualism, which only becomes\r\nmore marked and healthily developed by wide social intercourse), has in\r\nall ages tended to split up society into smaller parts, animated by\r\nmutual rivalry, jealousy, and hostility. When these antagonisms have\r\nbeen carried to a certain length the evil cures itself, by the rise of a\r\ndespotism, which, as the instrument in the hands of Providence, brings\r\nall these clashing communities under a strong government, that binds\r\nthem over, as it were, to keep the peace. By this, leisure and\r\nopportunity are given for the cultivation of the arts, the sciences, and\r\nindustries, which tend to humanize men, and lessen the restless war\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nThus the massing of many petty and warring tribes of barbarians into one\r\nlarge nation, and under a strong despotic monarchy, without which they\r\ncould neither have been brought together nor kept together, is so much\r\ngained for human progress.\r\n\r\nAfter this has continued for a time, when certain changes, certain\r\nameliorations have been effected in the intellectual, social, and moral\r\ncharacter of the nation, from the cultivation of the arts of peace, it\r\nis then allowed to be broken up, as the period may have arrived for the\r\ninfusion of new elements and agencies of social progress which shall\r\nplace men upon a higher plane of national existence. It falls to pieces\r\nthrough its own corruption and degeneracy, or by the invasion of\r\nstronger neighbors. It is swallowed up by the destroying force, and its\r\npeople, its institutions, its ideas, its arts and sciences, its customs,\r\nlaws, modes of life, or whatever else it may have elaborated, become\r\nmingled with those of surrounding nations, and a new political and\r\nsocial structure, formed out of the old and the new elements recombined\r\nanew and useless matter eliminated--stands forth in history; a structure\r\ntending still more than previous conditions to raise men in the scale of\r\ncivilization--to bring them into closer relations--to enlarge and\r\nmultiply their ideas--to quicken their moral and social impulses--to rub\r\noff the harsh angles of a selfish, narrow-minded individualism, and, in\r\na word, to advance them yet more toward that degree of virtue and\r\nintelligence which is absolutely indispensable to the union of large\r\nmasses of men into a nation, whose political system shall at once unite\r\nthe utmost freedom for each individual with the most perfect general\r\norder also.\r\n\r\nFor the establishment of such a government we think the world has been\r\ncarried through a long educational process; for in such a government,\r\nmen will find the greatest earthly happiness, and also the greatest\r\nfacilities and inducements to live in such a way as shall secure the\r\nhappiness that lies beyond. And we think that the course of events in\r\nhistory will show that such a method as that described has been pursued\r\nby Providence, gathering men from the isolation and warfare of petty and\r\nindependent tribes, into large despotisms, where the lower, rude, and\r\nselfish passions of wild men being held in restraint, some opportunity\r\nis given for peaceful pursuits and the development of a higher range of\r\nmental qualities--breaking these despotisms up again at certain periods,\r\nand massing their constituent elements into larger or differently\r\nconstituted governments, with new agencies of progress added, according\r\nas human mental conditions and needs required.\r\n\r\nThat those great ancient monarchies, as the Assyrian, Persian, etc., had\r\nthis effect, cannot well be doubted. But in the rise and fall of the\r\ngreat Roman empire, this appears very plainly. How many nations and\r\nsmall communities--far and near--isolated, independent, and more or less\r\nengaged in wars among themselves or in the constant apprehension of\r\nit--how many, we say, of such communities were gathered under the broad\r\nwings of the Roman eagle! From Spain and England on the west, to the\r\nborders of India on the east--from the Baltic on the north, to the\r\ndeserts of Africa on the south--all were brought under the Roman sway;\r\nwere brought under a common tranquillity (such as it was), under a\r\ncommon government, common laws, a common civilization more or less. All\r\nthese countries were raised from a lower to a higher condition by their\r\nsubjection to Roman domination. How far superior in England was the\r\nRoman civilization, its laws, manners, institutions, to the rude\r\nAnglican and Saxon life!\r\n\r\nRome thus established a grand humanizing unity over all these different\r\nregions, which otherwise had remained divided, hostile, or isolated from\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, through the instrumentality of this Roman unity,\r\nChristianity was established with comparative ease over the greater part\r\nof the then known world. This would perhaps have been very difficult if\r\nnot impossible had these regions been occupied by a multitude of\r\nindependent, and most likely, warring sovereignties.\r\n\r\nChristianity thus widely planted, and firmly rooted upon this Roman\r\ncivilization and by means of it, and this civilization, now perfected as\r\nfar as it was capable of being, or standing in the way of further human\r\nprogress, the empire fell to pieces, to make room for a new order of\r\nthings, in which Christianity, the remains of Roman civilization, and\r\nthe peculiar features of northern barbarian life, were the ingredients.\r\nThese elements, after numberless combinations, dissolutions, and\r\nreconstructions, have resulted in the civilization of modern Europe. The\r\nprogress toward this civilization has everywhere exhibited a constant\r\ntendency to larger and larger national unities--parts coalescing into\r\nwholes, and these into yet larger units. Witness the reduction of the\r\nnumber of German principalities, from one hundred or more to forty in\r\nthe present day--the movement now on foot in Germany for a federal union\r\namong these forty--also the new Italian nationality. These we mention\r\nbut incidentally, not intending here to trace the steps of this advance.\r\n\r\nThis progress toward unity has also been accompanied with a constant\r\nthough slow advance in the principles of religious and political\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nBut now, out of this European civilization, the result itself of the\r\nbreaking up of the Roman semi-pagan, semi-Christian empire, and the\r\nmultiplied interminglings, changes, and reconstructions of the\r\nRoman, the ecclesiastical, and northern barbarian elements--out\r\nof this European civilization, with its movements toward large\r\nnationalities--its progress toward religious and political freedom, and\r\ntoward the acknowledgment and recognition of human rights; the\r\nsubstitution of constitutional monarchies for absolute, and the creation\r\nof representative bodies from the people as part of the government--out\r\nof all this, there springs as the fruit of all the long turmoil, the\r\nwars, the blood and treasure, the groans and tears, the martyrdoms of\r\ncountless human lives, that during these long ages have, apparently in\r\nvain, been offered up in the cause of liberty, of order, of national\r\npeace, unity and freedom, of the right of man to the full and legitimate\r\nuse of all his God-given faculties--there springs, we say, as the fruit,\r\nthe result of all this suffering, our glorious American republic! our\r\nsacred--yes, our sacred Union! The fairest home that man has ever raised\r\nfor man! To lay violent hands on which, should be deemed the blackest,\r\nmost unpardonable sacrilege. It is the actualization of a dazzling\r\nvision, that may have often glowed in the imagination of many a patriot\r\nand statesman of olden times--which he may have vainly struggled to\r\nrealize in his own age and nation, and died at last, heart-broken, amid\r\nthe carnage of civil strife.\r\n\r\nOur republic, we repeat, is the fruit of European struggles. If Europe\r\nhad not passed through what she has, the United States would never have\r\narisen. The principles of religious and political liberty sprang to\r\nbirth in Europe, but there they have been of tardy growth, because\r\nsurrounded and opposed by habits and institutions of early ages. They\r\nneeded transplantation to a new and unoccupied soil, where they could\r\nenjoy the free air and sunshine, and not be overshadowed by anything\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nHere then we have our American civilization, formed out of what was good\r\nin European, combined with much else that has had its origin upon our\r\nown shores--the result of free principles allowed _almost_ unobstructed\r\nplay.\r\n\r\nLet us survey the many elements of unity which we possess.\r\n\r\nFirst in large measure, a common origin, viz., from England--that\r\ncountry of Europe farthest advanced of any other in religion, in\r\npolitics, in freedom, and in science and industry.\r\n\r\nNext, a common birth, as it were, in the form of numerous colonies, from\r\nthe mother country; planted almost simultaneously, it may be said;\r\npossessed of common charters, which differed but slightly--containing\r\nsystems of colonial administration, full of the spirit of popular rights\r\nand representation.\r\n\r\nNext, a common language, a common literature, a common religion, and\r\ncommon interests, that should bind us together against all foes.\r\n\r\nLastly, a common territory, washed by the two remote oceans--a\r\nterritory, in the present advanced state of science and of improved\r\nmodes of travel and of communication, without any material dividing\r\nlines or barriers; but having, on the contrary, an immense river in the\r\ncentre, stretching its arms a thousand miles on either side, as if on\r\npurpose to keep the vast region forever one and united.\r\n\r\nNever was the birth of a nation so full of promise--so full of all the\r\nelements of a prosperous growth. If any one event can be said to be,\r\nmore than another, under the divine guidance, then, all the\r\ncircumstances attending the colonization of these shores and the\r\nformation of this Union, have been most minutely and marvellously\r\nprovidential. 'Here at last,' we may conceive some superior being to\r\nexclaim, who from his higher sphere has watched with deep sympathy the\r\nweary earth-journey of the human race, 'here at last, after these long\r\nages of discipline and suffering, has a long desired goal been reached.\r\nHere a portion of the human family, having attained to such a degree of\r\nvirtue and intelligence, combined with skill in political arrangements,\r\nand a commensurate knowledge of art, and science, and industrial\r\npursuits--may be intrusted with liberty proportioned to their moral and\r\nintellectual advancement. Here they shall begin to live unitedly, more\r\nand more in accordance with the divine intentions than man has ever yet\r\ndone. Millions on millions shall here be banded together into one vast,\r\nfree, yet orderly community, where each individual shall enjoy all the\r\nliberty to which he is entitled by his moral character, and possess all\r\npossible facilities for the full and healthy development of his entire\r\nnature. Here, under the combined influence of true religion,\r\nintelligence, and freedom--and these must go hand in hand--the millions\r\ncomposing this great nation must become ever more and more united,\r\nprosperous, and happy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis then, is the first reason why the Union is priceless--because in\r\nthis Union, Providence appears to have reached an end, a goal, to which\r\nit has long been in the effort to conduct the human race, viz., the\r\nbringing a larger and more rapidly increasing population into a more\r\nfree, united, and happy life, one more in accordance with human wants,\r\nand with the measureless divine benevolence, than has ever yet been\r\nbrought about in the annals of mankind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe proceed now to consider the second reason why the Union is priceless.\r\n\r\nThis reason lies in the _method_ of the organization of this Government.\r\n\r\nWhat is this plan or method?\r\n\r\nWe reply that the immense value of the Union rests also upon the\r\nincontrovertible fact (perhaps not widely suspected, but evident enough\r\nwhen looked for) that the system of government of these United States,\r\nthe mode in which the smaller and larger communities are combined into\r\nthe great whole, together with the working of all in concert, _comes the\r\nnearest of any other political structure to the Creator's method of\r\ncombining parts into wholes throughout the universe_.\r\n\r\nWherever we behold a specimen of the divine creative skill, whether in\r\nthe mineral, vegetable, animal, or human kingdoms; whether it be a\r\ncrystal, a tree, a bird, or beast, a man, or a solar system, in all\r\nthese we observe one universal method of grouping, common to all\r\nconditions. This method is that of grouping parts around centres, and\r\nseveral of such groups around larger centres, upward and onward\r\nindefinitely; while in living beings, according to their complexity,\r\neach individual part, and each individual group of parts with its\r\ncentre, _is left free to move within its own sphere, yet at the same\r\ntime is harmonized with the movements of its neighbors through the\r\nmedium of the common centre_.\r\n\r\nEvery such work of the Creator is an _E pluribus unum_, a one out of\r\nmany--a unit composed of many diversified parts, exhibiting a marvellous\r\nunity, with an equally wonderful variety. Look at yonder tree, examine\r\nits parts, leaves, twigs, branches, trunk, all endowed with a common\r\nlife. Yet each little individual leaf lives and moves freely upon its\r\ncentre or twig, which is a common centre for many leaves. Many little\r\ntwigs in their turn, each free to move by itself within a certain limit,\r\nare ranged along their common centre, a branch. Many branches cluster\r\naround a large one, and all the largest branches in their turn cluster\r\naround the common trunk, or great centre supporting the whole fabric.\r\nEach leaf and twig and branch contributes its share to the life of the\r\nwhole tree, and is in turn supported by the general life and circulating\r\nsap.\r\n\r\nAll this is repeated with far greater fulness and complexity in the\r\nliving animal, or in the human body. How numerous are the parts\r\ncomposing a single organ! How many organs go to one system, how many\r\nsystems, bony, muscular, fibrous, circulatory, nervous, combine to make\r\nup the entire body! Then again, all the members of the body move,\r\n_within a certain limit_, in perfect independence of all the rest. The\r\nfinger can move without the hand, the hand can move without the arm, the\r\nforearm without the upper arm, the entire arm without any other limb;\r\nand yet all the parts of one limb, and all the limbs together, are\r\nharmonized in action by the central brain.\r\n\r\nSo also in the solar system. The moons move around the planets; the\r\nplanets around the sun; our group of suns around their magnetic axis,\r\nthe milky way; yet each of these heavenly bodies rolls freely in its own\r\norbit. In all these instances we have the great problem solved, of\r\nreconciling liberty with order, liberty of the individual parts with\r\nperfect order in the whole.\r\n\r\nAs far then as human governments imitate this divine method of\r\norganization seen in created objects, so far do they solve this problem\r\nin the sphere of political arrangements, making due allowance of course\r\nfor the disturbing influence acting in man's own mental constitution, by\r\nreason of his fall from the innocence and holiness in which he was\r\ncreated. It is just because this divine and universal method has been\r\nunconsciously followed by the good and wise and immortal framers of the\r\nnational Constitution, and also because the morality and intelligence of\r\nthe people were adapted to this wise political structure, that the\r\nAmerican nation has prospered as it has, and become the envy of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIs it asked in what consists this resemblance? We reply that it is in\r\nthe grouping of\r\n\r\n     Individuals into townships;\r\n\r\n     Of the townships into counties;\r\n\r\n     Of the counties into States;\r\n\r\n     Of the States into the national Union, with a central government.\r\n\r\nThe township acts in township affairs through its officers, who\r\ncollectively compose its centre, and harmonize the actions of all the\r\nindividuals of the township in all matters which concern that individual\r\ntownship. Through their officers, the people of the township act freely\r\ntogether within the lawful sphere of the township. The common wants of\r\nthe township are attended to by the people through their officers, who\r\ncompose the centre around which all township action revolves.\r\n\r\nA number of townships, having common wants, are erected into a county.\r\nThe county officers and county court form the harmonizing centre of this\r\nlarger organization.\r\n\r\nA number of counties, having common wants, are erected into a State,\r\nwith a State government. This is the harmonizing centre, concentrating\r\nthe efforts of as many counties, townships, and individuals as may be\r\nrequisite to accomplish an object in any portion of the State, or in the\r\nwhole of it. At ten days' notice by its Governor, Pennsylvania sent near\r\none hundred thousand men into the field. Without political organization\r\nthis could never have been effected. What a power is here exhibited, and\r\nyet all emanating directly from the people, without coercion of any\r\nkind, beyond respect for their own-made laws! The spectacle is truly\r\ngrand.\r\n\r\nFinally, the States altogether have common wants, which only a central,\r\nnational government can supply. (Oh the deep wickedness or trebly\r\nintensified insanity of secession! Language fails to express the utter\r\nmadness of the rebel leaders: the recklessness of a suicide is nothing\r\nin comparison; for here are eight millions of men intent upon their own\r\ndestruction; fighting the North like fiends, because it would rescue\r\nthem from themselves, and save both North and South from a common abyss\r\nof ruin!) The national government alone is strong at home and respected\r\nabroad. It alone can concentrate the energies and resources of\r\nthirty-four States, and of thirty-one millions of people, into any one\r\nor many modes of activity which the nation may judge best for its own\r\ninterest. It is thus resistless. No single foreign power in the world\r\nnor any probable or possible alliance of foreign powers could hope to\r\neffect anything, with an army of three or four millions of soldiers that\r\nthe entire republic could raise and keep in the field. Thus in union is\r\nour strength at home, for it gives the whole power and resources of the\r\nnation to works of common utility and necessity. Such are the\r\nmaintenance of the army and navy, the building and support of forts,\r\nlighthouses, and customhouses, collection of the revenue, the keeping\r\nrivers and harbors navigable, the establishment of a general post\r\noffice, and its countless ramifying branches, constructing immense\r\npublic works, like the Pacific railroad, providing for extensive coast\r\nsurveys, and the like. Then in a different department, harmonizing the\r\naction of States by national laws, by the Supreme Court, and by the\r\nnational courts in each State, dispensing an even justice throughout the\r\nentire Union, by deciding appeals from State and county courts. Each\r\nState enjoys the benefits of these national functions, with the least\r\npossible cost to itself; and were there no national government, each\r\nState would have to provide itself with all these things, or what\r\nproportion of them it required, at a very heavy outlay of its own more\r\nlimited resources, and would be obliged to double, perhaps quadruple its\r\ntaxes. Each State requires the means of its own defence; and as they\r\nwould all be independent sovereignties, each would be compelled, like\r\nthe European nations, to keep its own standing army, and watch its\r\nneighbors closely, and be ready to bristle up on the least sign of\r\naggression on their part. The soldiers of each standing army would be,\r\nas in Europe, so much power withdrawn from productive industry, kept in\r\nidleness, and supported by those who were left free to labor. Each State\r\nrequires a postal system; those on the seaboard require tariffs, a navy,\r\netc., and in the absence of a national government we can hardly form an\r\nidea of the endless disputes that would ensue from these and a thousand\r\nother sources. For this reason the old federation of the States was an\r\nexperience of inexpressible value. It settled forever, in the minds of\r\nall communities who are governed by cool common sense and not mad\r\npassion, the utter impracticability (for efficient coöperation, and\r\npeaceful union) of a mere league or confederacy among sovereign and\r\nindependent States. While the seven years' war of independence lasted,\r\nit managed to hold the States together; but when peace was restored the\r\nevils of the league were so glaring, and the dangers in the future so\r\nimminent, that the good sense of the people saved the young nation in\r\ntime, by sheltering it under that broad, strong roof, the present\r\nnational Constitution. Thus the individual States legislate and act for\r\nthemselves in all that concerns themselves alone. But in that which\r\nconcerns themselves in connection and in common with other States, and\r\nwhere, if each State were absolutely independent, such State action\r\nwould come into conflict with the wants or rights of other States, and\r\nalso be a great cost to the single State--all such common and general\r\nmatters are accomplished with uniformity and harmony by all the States\r\ncollectively through the general or central government.\r\n\r\nBut further.--This central government itself, like the nation which it\r\nserves, is a compound body; a unit composed of parts, each of which in\r\nits own sphere is independent, yet beyond that sphere is limited by the\r\nfunctions of the other parts. This government is a _triple_ compound,\r\nand consists of the legislative, the judicial, and the executive\r\ndepartments.\r\n\r\nThe legislative, or Congress, declares the will of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe judicial or judging department decides and declares the proper ways\r\nand means, the how, the when, the persons and conditions, according to\r\nwhich this national will is to be carried out, and--the executive\r\ndepartment is the arm and hand that does the carrying out; that performs\r\nby its proclamations and by its civil and military agents, what the\r\nCongress and judicial departments have willed and constitutionally\r\ndecided shall be done.\r\n\r\nThus is perceived a beautiful analogy between these three departments\r\nacting separately and yet in concert--and the will, the intellect, and\r\nthe bodily powers of the individual man. A man's will is very different\r\nand distinct from his intellect or reasoning faculty; and both will and\r\nintellect are widely distinct from the bodily powers. Not only are these\r\nthree distinct and totally different elements in man's nature, but only\r\nin the degree that they remain distinct, and that they are duly balanced\r\nagainst each other, and that they all act in concert--only in this\r\ndegree is the life of the individual self-poised, harmonious, and free.\r\n\r\nAnd precisely the same is true of these three functions of government.\r\nIt is essential to a free republican state that these functions should\r\nremain distinct, and administered by different bodies. When they are all\r\nmerged into each other, and rested in a single individual or a single\r\nbody of individuals, the government is then a despotism. The very\r\nessence of what we understand by despotism, is this massing, this fusing\r\ntogether of elements that can properly and justly live and act _only_\r\nwhen each is at liberty, in freedom to be itself, in order that it may\r\nperform its own, its peculiar and appropriate function, in harmonious\r\nconnection with others performing theirs. Despotism is the binding,\r\ncompressing, suffocating of individual life; first of the three\r\nfunctions of government, which should always be kept separate, and next,\r\nas a natural and inevitable consequence, of those who come under that\r\nsolidified administration. The nation governed by a despotism must be\r\nmoulded after the same pattern; it must necessarily have the variety and\r\nfreedom of its many constituent parts destroyed, and be massed and\r\nmelted together into a homogeneous and indiscriminate whole; only\r\npermeated in all directions by the channels conveying the will of the\r\ndespotic head.\r\n\r\nThus the province of free government is not to be conceived of as that\r\nof restraining, repressing, punishing. This is only its negative\r\nfunction. Its positive office is the very opposite, and is truly a most\r\nexalted one. And this is, to remove every barrier to the freest outflow\r\nof human energies. It is to give an open field and the widest scope for\r\nthe play of every human faculty consistent with right. Government does\r\nthis, by establishing order among multitudes teeming with life and\r\nactivity--each seeking, in his own way, the broadest vent for his\r\nGod-given energies. These human energies are given to men for the very\r\npurpose that they may flow forth in a thousand modes of activity and\r\nindustry, and that, thus, men may mutually impart an exalted happiness\r\nupon each other. These energies are to be repressed only when they are\r\nwrong, when they take a wrong direction, when they conflict with the\r\nwelfare of the community. When these energies, these human impulses to\r\nact, are right, when they aim at useful results, then they must have\r\nevery facility, every possible channel opened to their outflow. And the\r\nvery first and most essential condition of this free outflow of life\r\namong multitudes is, that there be order among them--that there be some\r\nsystem, some methodical arrangement whereby concert and unity of action\r\nmay be effected among this diversified life. Without this order\r\n--without systems or common methods of action in the thousand affairs\r\nwhich concern every community, it is evident that there must be\r\n_dis_order, confusion, and clashing. The activity of each individual,\r\nand of each class of individuals, will come into collision, and be\r\nrepressed by the like activity of others. It is utterly impossible, in a\r\ncommunity where there is no order, no mutually understood arrangement of\r\nrelations, duties, and pursuits; in other words, where there is no\r\ngovernment; it is impossible, under such conditions, for individuals, if\r\neven of the best intentions, to live and do as they wish. For many wills\r\nmust come into conflict, unless they can be harmonized, unless they have\r\na mutual understanding and consent among each other that there shall be\r\ncommon and well-defined methods of procedure, under the countless\r\ncircumstances in which men _must_ act together, or not act at all.\r\n\r\nNow, it is the true function of government to establish, these common or\r\ngeneral modes of procedure, termed laws, among masses, and to punish\r\ndepartures from them. Government is thus the great social harmonizer of\r\nthese otherwise necessarily conflicting and mutually interfering human\r\nenergies.\r\n\r\nGovernment coördinates, harmonizes, concentrates the efforts of\r\nmultitudes. It does this by establishing and maintaining _order_, an\r\norderly arrangement of human activities--arrangements, methods of\r\nprocedure, which are adapted to the wants of the community, and _into_\r\nwhich men's activities flow freely and spontaneously, and without\r\ncompulsion (except in the case of violators of law), because of their\r\nadaptation to the public wants.\r\n\r\nBut now, what constitutes order? What is its essential nature?\r\n\r\nThe answer is, that order is the harmonious relation of parts in a\r\nwhole; and parts can have no orderly, that is, symmetrical and\r\nharmonious, relation to each other, except through their relation to a\r\ncommon centre.\r\n\r\nOrder is the _sub_ordination of things, of things lower to something\r\nthat is higher; and _sub_ordination is the ordination or ordering of\r\nparts _under_ something that is above--something to which the rest must\r\n_con_form, that is, must form themselves or be formed _with_ it, in\r\nharmony with it, if order is to result.\r\n\r\nThis something is thus, of course, that which is central--the chief\r\nelement in the group; that which is the most prominent feature, and\r\nwhich gives character to all subordinate parts.\r\n\r\nIt is thus clearly evident that the very essence of government, of\r\norder, of harmony, of subordination, is the grouping of individual parts\r\naround centres; of these compound units as larger individuals, around\r\nsome higher centre again, and so on, until a limit is prescribed by the\r\nvery nature of the thing thus organized into an ascending series of\r\ncompounds.\r\n\r\nThis method of grouping and organizing parts into wholes, is, as we have\r\nalready seen, the divine method; and, of course, being such, as has also\r\nbeen said, it is seen in every created object--in minerals, plants,\r\nanimals, and in the systems of suns and planets.\r\n\r\nIt is the method of man's bodily organization, and much more, if\r\npossible, is it the method of his mental organization. Man's mind\r\nconsists of powers of affection and thought. His affections, loves,\r\ndesires, or whatever they may be termed, all group themselves around\r\nsome leading motive, some ruling passion, which is central for a part or\r\nthe whole of a lifetime. All minor motives and ends of action are\r\nsubordinate, and only subservient as a means to satisfy the central,\r\ndominant passion. They revolve around it, like satellites around their\r\nprimary, or like planets around their sun.\r\n\r\nHis thoughts, likewise--the method of his intellectual operations, obey\r\nthe same law. In every subject which he investigates, he marshals a\r\nmultitude of facts around central principles or conclusions. He shuts\r\nthem up under a general, chief, leading fact or law. A number of\r\nconclusions, again, are marshalled around one still more general and\r\ncomprehensive, and thus he mounts up into the highest and most universal\r\nprinciples. All the knowledge stored away in his mind is thus organized,\r\nalmost without his consciousness, into groups of lower and higher facts\r\nand details, ranged under or around their central principles.\r\n\r\nThe closer and more symmetrical is this grouping of particulars and\r\ngenerals in the intellect, or, rather, the greater the power thus to\r\narrange them, the more logical and compactly reasoning is that mind. The\r\nlooser and less connected is this grouping, the less logical is the\r\nmind; and when the proper connection fails to be made between\r\nparticulars and generals, between facts and their principles, or between\r\nparts and their centre, then the mind is in an idiotic or insane\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nNow, man's mental movements, being thus themselves obedient to this\r\ngreat order-evolving method, then, of course, when he applies his\r\nfaculties to investigate the objects and phenomena of the outer world,\r\nhe classifies, arranges, and disposes them strictly after the same\r\nmethod, because he cannot help doing so. The naturalist studies\r\nminerals, plants, animals--and each kingdom, at his bidding, marshals\r\nitself into order before him. Each resolves its otherwise confused\r\nhosts into groups and series of groups, each with its own centre and\r\nleading type. The animal kingdom has its sub-kingdoms, classes, orders,\r\nfamilies, and species. Botanists speak of divisions, classes, orders,\r\ngenera, and species, &c., species being the first assemblage of\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, seen that, by the very necessity of the case, when men\r\nthemselves are to be massed into communities and nations, they come\r\ninevitably under the same universal method of organization. Whether the\r\ngovernment be free, or whether it be despotic, it must, in either case,\r\nbe organized, and organized according to this universal method. It must\r\nconsist of parts with their centres, compounded into wholes, and of\r\nthese compound units formed into still larger ones; until the entire\r\nnation, as a grand whole, revolves upon a central pivot, or national\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nBut here there presents itself a vast distinction between despotic and\r\nfree governments--a distinction which arises out of the different\r\nrelations sustained, in these respective modes of administration,\r\nbetween the government and the people--between the centre and the\r\nsubordinate parts. What is this difference?\r\n\r\nIf we look around through nature, we shall find that all organized\r\nbeings, that is, beings composed of different parts or organs, all\r\naiding, in their several ways, to the performance of a common function,\r\nor a number of harmonized functions--in such an organized structure,\r\nwhether it be a plant, an animal, the human body, or even the globe\r\nitself, we shall find two reciprocal movements--one from the centre,\r\noutward, and another from without, inward, or toward the centre; and\r\nfurther, that the integrity of the life of the individual depends upon\r\nthe harmonious relation or balance between these two opposite movements.\r\n\r\nThe individual man, for instance, is a centre of active energies that\r\nare ever radiating from himself toward men and things around him; and he\r\nreceives from them, in return, countless impressions and various\r\nmaterials for supporting his own life. What is thus true of the man\r\nhimself, is also true of the organs and systems of organs of which his\r\nbody is composed. The nervous system exhibits nerves with double\r\nstrands; one set (the motor fibres) conveying nervous force from the\r\ncentre as motor power to the limbs; the other, conveying sensations _to_\r\nthe centre, from without.\r\n\r\nThe heart, again, the centre of the circulating system, sends forth its\r\ncrimson tide to the farthest circumference, and receives it back as\r\nvenous blood--to send it forth afresh when purified in the lungs.\r\n\r\nThe plant has its ascending and descending sap; it drinks in the air and\r\nsunshine, and gives these forth again in fragrance and fruit. The very\r\nglobe receives its life from the sun--and radiates back, forces into\r\nspace.\r\n\r\nHuman governments--human political and social organizations, are no\r\nexceptions to this general law. Every government, even the most\r\ndespotic, while it rules a nation with a rod of iron, depends for its\r\nlife upon the people whom it oppresses. While the central head radiates\r\nits despotic will through its pliant subordinates, down through all\r\nranks and classes of the community, it receives from them the means of\r\nits own preservation.\r\n\r\nA free government likewise radiates authority from the central head, and\r\nalso depends for its life on the people whom it governs. What is the\r\npoint of difference between them?\r\n\r\nIt is simply this:\r\n\r\nThere are two elements of power in a nation.\r\n\r\nOne is _moral_, viz., the free-will and consent of the people.\r\n\r\nThe other is _physical_, viz., military service, and revenue from\r\ntaxation.\r\n\r\nThe free consent of the people is the _soul_ of the national strength.\r\n\r\nThe treasure and the armies which they furnish, constitute the _body_.\r\n\r\nFor the highest efficiency, soul and body must act as one, whether in\r\nthe individual or in the collective man. They must not be separated.\r\nHence the perfect right of men who would be free to refuse to be taxed\r\nby government without being represented--without having a voice in its\r\nmanagement. The _material_ support must not be given without the\r\n_moral_--that is one form of slavery.\r\n\r\nBut of these two elements of national strength, a despotism, a\r\ngovernment of force, possesses and commands only the physical or\r\nmaterial, viz., military service and revenue. It controls only the\r\n_body_ of the national powers. Not resting upon the broad basis of the\r\nfree choice and consent of the people, it is like a master who can force\r\nthe body of another to do his bidding, while the spirit is in concealed\r\nrebellion. Such a government, in proportion as it severs this national\r\nsoul from the body, is weak through constant liability to overthrow,\r\nfrom any chance failure of its material props.\r\n\r\nA free government, on the other hand, possesses both the elements of\r\nstrength. It rests upon the free will and affection of the people, as\r\nwell as upon the abundant material support which they must ever yield to\r\na government of their own creation, and which exists solely for their\r\nown use and benefit. Such a government is capable and strong in exact\r\nproportion to the virtue and intelligence of the masses from whom it\r\nemanates.\r\n\r\nThus it is seen that a despotism differs from a free government as to\r\nthe reciprocal action that takes place between the people and the\r\ngovernment. In a despotism, all authority flows only in one direction,\r\nviz., from the central head down to the different ranks of subordinate\r\nofficers, and through these numerous channels it reaches all classes of\r\nthe people. But there is no returning stream of authority from the\r\npeople to the government, from the parts to the centre. The only return\r\nflow is that of military service and revenue.\r\n\r\nBut a free government returns to the people all that it receives from\r\nthem. From the masses there converges, through a thousand channels, to\r\nthe central government, both the elements of national strength, viz.,\r\nauthority to act, and the means of carrying out this authority, that is,\r\nmoney and military service--the body, of which the popular will and\r\nauthority is the soul. The people declare their will that such and such\r\nindividuals shall be clothed with, and represent their united power, and\r\nact for them in this representative capacity. The persons thus chosen,\r\nand who constitute the government or central head, with its subordinate\r\nagencies, declare from this central position of authority with which\r\nthey have been invested by the people, that such and such things are\r\nnecessary for the welfare and orderly activity of the people, and in the\r\nname, and with the coöperation of the people, they _will_ to carry these\r\nmeasures out.\r\n\r\nThus life, energy, power, from the people, flow from all points to the\r\ngovernment, to the centre; and from the government it flows back again\r\nto the people as _order_, as the force that arranges, methodizes,\r\nharmonizes, and regulates the outflow of the popular energies in all the\r\ndepartments of human activity. It clears the channels of national\r\nindustry of all obstacles. By its legislative, judicial, and executive\r\nfunctions, it establishes, on the one hand, common methods of action\r\namong multitudes having common interests and aims, and thus obviates\r\nclashing and confusion; and, on the other, it punishes those who would\r\ninterfere with and obstruct or destroy this order.\r\n\r\nThe government is the concentrated will and intelligence of the people,\r\ndirected to the wise guidance of the national life--directed to the\r\nharmonizing of the diversified activity and industry of the nation, to\r\nthe opening of all possible channels for that activity, and to the\r\nremoval of everything that would obstruct and counteract the nation's\r\nutmost development and progress.\r\n\r\nIn this way, a free government exhibits, as far as human imperfection\r\nadmits, the union of the two great principles, _liberty_ and _order_.\r\nThe people are free to think, talk, write, and act as they see fit; but\r\nsince there can be no liberty, but only license, or lawlessness, without\r\norder--without beneficent methods, symmetrical forms and arrangements,\r\n_in which_ that liberty can be enjoyed by individuals and communities,\r\nwithout conflicting with other individuals and communities, parts of the\r\nsame free whole--therefore government is created by the people to\r\nprescribe and maintain this order, essential to this common liberty; an\r\norder which is the _form_, or _forms_, under which both individuals and\r\ncommunities shall act, singly or in concert, in the countless relations\r\nin which the members of the same community or nation come into contact\r\nwith each other.\r\n\r\nNow, in the United States, the chart of this orderly and symmetrical\r\nnetwork of political arrangements for the free movement among each other\r\nof the individuals in the township, of the townships in the county, of\r\nthe counties in the State, and of the States in the Union--and within\r\nthe protecting lines of which political arrangements, the people are\r\nenabled to pursue their industrial avocations without mutual\r\ninterference and collision, and to attend in peace and security to all\r\nthe employments that tend to elevate, refine, and freely develop the\r\nindividual man (for government is only and solely a _means_ to this\r\ngreat end)--the chart, we say, of all these orderly arrangements, is our\r\nimmortal national Constitution, together with the State constitutions\r\nthat cluster around it, as their centre, axis, and support.\r\n\r\nThrough each State constitution, the national and central one sends down\r\nan iron arm, clasping them all by a firm bond to itself and to each\r\nother. And in each, the grasp of this arm is riveted and double riveted,\r\nabove and below, by these two comprehensive, unmistakable articles,\r\nwithout which the others had else been valueless; and for which the\r\nframers of this great instrument are entitled to our lasting gratitude\r\nand admiration.\r\n\r\nThe articles are these, viz.: Art. 6th, sec. 2d: 'This Constitution, and\r\nthe laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof\r\n... _shall be the supreme law of the land_ ... anything in the\r\nconstitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.'\r\n\r\nAnd art. 4th, sec. 4th: 'The United States shall _guarantee_ to every\r\nState in the Union a _republican_ form of government, and shall protect\r\neach of them against invasion....'\r\n\r\nThe first of these admits of no separation or secession. The second\r\npreserves everywhere that form of government under which alone the\r\nfullest political freedom can be enjoyed. In fighting, then, for the\r\nConstitution, we fight for an undivided Union on the one hand, and, on\r\nthe other, for a Union that guarantees to each member of it that form of\r\ngovernment which secures the greatest liberty to those who live under\r\nit. May we not, we say again, rest in an all but certain hope that the\r\nDivine Being will see fit to preserve His own work? For such, though\r\naccomplished through human agency, we feel constrained to believe, have\r\nbeen this Union and its remarkable constitution.\r\n\r\nWe have regarded the Union as the culmination of a long series of\r\nendeavors, so to call them, on the part of Providence, to bring men from\r\na social condition characterized by the multiplicity, diversity,\r\nseparation, antagonism, and hostility of independent, warring, petty\r\nstates, into that larger, higher form of political and social life, that\r\nshall combine in itself the three conditions of unity--variety in unity,\r\nand of the utmost liberty with order--as the soul and life of the\r\npolitical body. And that it has also been the aim of Providence, in the\r\nformation of this Union, to accomplish the above object on as large a\r\nscale as possible, in the present moral and intellectual condition of\r\nthe race.\r\n\r\nCan we be far wrong in such a view? Think of our republic embracing in\r\nits wide extent, one, two, three, or more hundred millions of human\r\nbeings, all in political union, enjoying the largest liberty possible in\r\nthe present life, as well as the ever-increasing influence and light of\r\nreligion, science, and education, giving augmented power to preserve and\r\nrightly use that liberty. Extent of territory in the present age, is no\r\nbar to the union of very distant regions. When the telegraph, that\r\nmodern miracle, brings the shores of the Pacific within three hours'\r\ntime of the Atlantic seaboard--when railroads contract States into\r\ncounties, and counties into the dimensions of an average farm, as to the\r\ntime taken to traverse them--when _spaces_ are thus brought into the\r\nclosest union, it is but the counterpart and prophecy of the close moral\r\nand industrial union of the people who inhabit the spaces. When slavery,\r\nthat relic of barbarism, that demon of darkness and discord, is\r\ndestroyed, we can conceive of nothing that shall possess like power to\r\nsunder one section of the Union from another--of nothing that shall not\r\nbe within the power of the people to settle by rational discussion or\r\namicable arbitration. No! Slavery once destroyed, an unimagined Future\r\ndawns upon the republic. The Southern rebellion, and the _utterly\r\nunavoidable_ civil war thence arising--as these are the two\r\ninstrumentalities by which slavery will be cut clean away from the\r\nvitals of the nation, and the Union left untrammelled, to follow its\r\ngreat destiny--these twin events, we say, will, in after ages, be looked\r\nback upon as blessings in disguise--as the knife of the surgeon, that\r\ngives the patient a new lease of a long, prosperous, and happy life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have contemplated the Union, and seen something of its matchless\r\nsymmetry, beauty, and indefinite capabilities, ever unfolding, to\r\npromote human welfare, through its unity with variety, its liberty with\r\norder, its freedom of action of each part in its own sphere, coëxisting\r\nwith the harmonious working of all together as one grand whole--all of\r\nwhich arises, as was said, from the unconscious modelling (on the part\r\nof its authors) of our political structure upon the Divine and universal\r\nplan of organization in mineral, in plant, in animal, in the planetary\r\nsystems, and, above all, in man himself, body and mind.\r\n\r\nWe saw that the method of this organization was the grouping of\r\nindividual parts into wholes around a centre; of many such compound\r\nunits around a yet higher centre, and so on, indefinitely, onward and\r\nupward. That by such an organization, individual freedom was secured to\r\neach part, within a certain limit, wide enough for all its wants, and\r\nyet perfectly subordinated to the freedom and order of all the parts\r\ncollectively, revolving or acting freely around the common centre and\r\nhead. We saw that in the Divine creations--in all the objects of the\r\nthree kingdoms of nature, the two great principles of liberty and order\r\nwere thus perfectly reconciled and harmonized (true _order_ being only\r\nthe _form_ under which true _liberty_ appears, or can appear); and,\r\nfurther, that in proportion as human affairs and institutions obey the\r\nsame law, or, rather, in proportion as men individually and collectively\r\nadvance in virtue and intelligence, do they unconsciously, and more or\r\nless spontaneously, come into this Divine order, both in the regulation\r\nof personal motive and conduct, and in outward political and social\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nHence, as has already been stated, the near approach to this method in\r\nthe political organization of the United States was the result of an\r\namount of moral and intellectual culture, first in the colonies, and\r\nafterward in the contrivers and adopters of our political framework,\r\nwithout which it could never have been formed; and in the degree that\r\nthis mental condition is maintained and advanced yet more and more, will\r\nthe citizens of the Union apply the same method of organization to the\r\nless general affairs of industrial and social life. Now, all this is not\r\nfancy; human progress in the direction indicated, can be scientifically\r\ndemonstrated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR SONG:--EARTH'S LAST BATTLE.\r\n\r\nDedicated To\r\n\r\nTHE SOLDIERS OF THE UNION.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Up with the Flag of Hope!\r\n    Let the winds waft her\r\n  On through the depths of space\r\n    Faster and faster!\r\n  Up, brave and sturdy men!\r\n    Down with the craven!\r\n  He who but falters now,\r\n    Fling to the raven!\r\n\r\n  CHORUS: On while the blood is hot--on to the battle!\r\n          Flash blade and trumpet sound! let the shot rattle!\r\n\r\n  Come from your homes of love\r\n    Wilder and faster!\r\n  Hail balls and sabres flash!\r\n    Wrong shall not master!\r\n  Strike to the throbbing heart\r\n    Brother or stranger!\r\n  Traitors would murder hope!\r\n    Freedom's in danger!\r\n\r\n  CHORUS: On for the rights of man--just is the battle!\r\n          Flesh deep the naked blade! let the shot rattle!\r\n\r\n  Men of the rugged North,\r\n    Dastards they deem you!\r\n  Wash out the lie in blood,\r\n    As it beseems you!\r\n  Glare in the Southern eye\r\n    Freedom, defiance!\r\n  Traitors with death and hell\r\n    Seal their alliance!\r\n\r\n  CHORUS: On--shed your heart's best blood! glorious the battle!\r\n          Freedom is born while death peals his shrill rattle!\r\n\r\n  Down with, the rattlesnake!\r\n    Armed heel upon it!\r\n  Rive the palmetto tree--\r\n    Cursed fruit grows on it!\r\n  Up with the Flag of Light!\r\n    Let the old glory\r\n  Flash down the newer stars\r\n    Rising in story!\r\n\r\n  CHORUS: On--manhood's hot blood burns!

I suppose it was partly owing to\r\nthe fact of my having arrived at a more thoughtful age, or it may be\r\nthat their peculiarities of disposition exhibited themselves more\r\nstrongly among strangers. They were neither of them surface characters.\r\nMiriam was too reserved, and Annie too artful to be easily understood.\r\nBut no one who had once known Miriam could, ever forget her. Her parents\r\ncalled her 'a peculiar child;' among her friends the old people called\r\nher 'queer,' and the young ones 'cracked,' She was not pretty, but\r\neverybody pronounced her a fine-looking girl. Her eyes were the only\r\npeculiarity in her face. They were of a rich, dark-gray color, small,\r\nand deeply set; but at times--her 'inspired times,' as Annie called\r\nthem--they would dilate and expand, until they became large and\r\nluminous. At such times she would relate with distinctness, and often\r\nwith minuteness, events which were transpiring in another house, and\r\nsometimes in another part of the world.\r\n\r\nIt was seldom that we had an opportunity of testing the truth of these\r\n'visions,' but when we did we found them exact in every particular.\r\n\r\nAt other times her mind took a wider range, and she would see into the\r\nfuture. When we were children, I remember the awe with which we used to\r\nlisten to 'Miriam the prophetess,' as we called her, and the wonder with\r\nwhich we remarked that her prophecies invariably were fulfilled. But, as\r\nI grew older, my awe and wonder diminished in proportion, and, being of\r\na very practical turn of mind myself, and very skeptical of spiritual\r\nagencies, mesmerism, and clairvoyance, and indeed of anything out of the\r\nordinary course of events, I put no faith whatever in any of Miriam's\r\nvisions and prophecies; especially as I noticed they only occurred when\r\nshe was sick, or suffering under depression of spirits. Annie either did\r\nbelieve, or professed to believe, every word she said. As Miriam grew\r\ninto womanhood it was only to Annie and me that she confided her strange\r\nvisions, although she well knew I did not believe in their reality. We\r\nwere the only ones who never laughed at her, and she was very sensitive\r\non the subject.\r\n\r\nAnnie was so beautiful that it was a delight to look at her lovely face,\r\nlisten to her musical voice, and watch her graceful motions. She fully\r\nappreciated her own charms, and had a way of making others appreciate\r\nthem also. She had many more friends than Miriam, for who could resist\r\nthe charm of her face and manner?\r\n\r\nShe had become quite accomplished, for she possessed a good deal of\r\ntalent, but was worldly minded, vain, and selfish. It may be matter of\r\nsurprise that such a girl should have been my intimate friend, and still\r\nstranger that she should have been the friend of Miriam; but she was\r\nlively and agreeable, and when we were children together we did not care\r\nto analyze her character, and when we knew her thoroughly we still loved\r\nher--from habit, I suppose. At all events, whatever were the sympathies\r\nwhich bound us together, we continued firm friends until we were\r\neighteen, when we left Madame Orleans' school, where we had resided for\r\nfour years.\r\n\r\nAt that time Annie returned to our native village, while Miriam and I\r\nwent to a Southern city, intending to spend the winter with her uncle's\r\nfamily; but we liked our new home so much that we prolonged our visit\r\ntwo years. After we had been there a few months, by some chance, which I\r\nhave now forgotten, Henry Ackermann came to the city where we resided.\r\nHe was a few years older than we, but had been one of our playmates in\r\nchildhood. His parents had removed from our native village, and gone to\r\nCalifornia some years before, when the gold fever was at its height,\r\nsince which time we had heard little about them, and Henry had nearly\r\nfaded out of our recollections, until now he suddenly appeared, destined\r\nto be the controlling fate in the life of one of us, for Miriam and he\r\nsoon grew to love one another; though what affinity there was between\r\ntheir natures I never could imagine. But he told me that he loved her,\r\nand she told me that she was very happy, and I was bound to believe them\r\nboth, and thought that on the whole they would be a better-matched\r\ncouple than most of those I saw about me.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say much of their courtship. Their engagement was not\r\nmade public, therefore it was not necessary to make a parade of their\r\naffection before indifferent acquaintance, Miriam's love, like that of\r\nall proud, reserved natures, was intense. Ackermann's attentions to her\r\nwere graceful and delicate, and he ever manifested toward her in his\r\nwhole manner that silent devotion, unobtrusive and indescribable, which\r\nis so gratifying to woman. It was evident that he understood her\r\nthoroughly: whether he appreciated her as thoroughly was another matter,\r\nabout which I had my doubts.\r\n\r\nIt was true that strange rumors had floated from California to our\r\ndistant little city in regard to Ackermann. Evil rumors they were--they\r\ncould scarcely be called rumors--nobody repeated them, nobody believed\r\nthem--and yet they were whispered into the ear so stealthily that it\r\nseemed as if they were breathed by the very air which surrounded\r\nAckermann. I paid no heed to them. Miriam heard them, did not care for\r\nthem--why should I?\r\n\r\nMonths passed away--happily to the lovers--pleasantly to me.\r\nCircumstances then compelled Ackermann to return to our village, while\r\nMiriam felt it to be her duty to remain where she was; but she expected\r\nto follow him in a few months at latest. He carried with him a letter of\r\nintroduction to Annie, in which Miriam told her of her engagement to the\r\nbearer, and requested Annie to be his friend for her sake. This was soon\r\nanswered by a characteristic letter from Annie congratulating Miriam on\r\nher choice, pronouncing Ackermann the most delightful of men, etc.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter which followed, Miriam seemed quietly happy and always\r\npleasant and cheerful. Henry's letters were frequent, and so were\r\nAnnie's. I did not see the former, but they appeared to afford a great\r\ndeal of satisfaction to Miriam. Annie's letters were as lively and merry\r\nas herself, and contained frequent hints that the devoted attentions of\r\na certain Mr. Etheridge--a wealthy, middle-aged suitor--were not\r\nentirely disagreeable to her; that she thought she should like right\r\nwell to be mistress of his fine mansion; with much more nonsense of the\r\nsame kind.\r\n\r\nI should have mentioned that Miriam had never told her lover of the\r\npeculiar gifts of prophecy and second sight which she had, or fancied\r\nthat she had. She was too happy at the time he was with her to be\r\nvisited by her 'visions.' I thought they had ceased altogether, and I\r\nthink Miriam believed they had, and was happy to be done with them\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nI was quite surprised then to see her walk into my room one day in a\r\nhurried manner, with a face ghastly pale, and eyes unusually distended,\r\nand gazing at me with a wild, fixed stare. She trembled exceedingly,\r\nand tried to speak, but the words refused to come at her bidding. I was\r\nmuch alarmed, and, remembering there was a glass of wine in the closet,\r\nI brought it to her, but she motioned it away. I opened the window, and\r\nthe rush of cold air revived her. She sat down by it, and after a little\r\ntime, she said:\r\n\r\n'Hester, do you remember the little sitting room of Annie's, at the foot\r\nof the back stairs, with windows opening into the garden?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I remember it perfectly. Why do you ask?'\r\n\r\n'She has had it newly furnished, and very elegantly.'\r\n\r\n'How do you know?'\r\n\r\n'Because I was there this afternoon; spent some time in it.'\r\n\r\n'You! in Annie's room!'\r\n\r\n_I_ was there, in Annie's room--that is, the only part of me that is\r\nworth anything; my body remained here, in my own room, I suppose.'\r\n\r\nI saw at once that the old spell was on her again, and, as I made it a\r\npoint to fall in with her humor on such occasions, I said:\r\n\r\n'Well, what did you see there?'\r\n\r\n'I saw an open piano, and books and music scattered around. There were a\r\ngreat many flowers in the room. A bright fire was in the grate, and\r\nPompey--the house dog--was stretched on a rug before it. A large\r\neasy-chair, covered with blue damask, stood near the fireplace. Henry\r\nAckermann was seated in it. Annie was kneeling before him. He talked to\r\nher while he stroked her hair. I heard every word that he said.'\r\n\r\nHere she paused. I was getting quite excited with her narrative, but I\r\nspoke as calmly as I could:\r\n\r\n'You have only fancied these things, Miriam. You are ill.'\r\n\r\n'The _material_ part of my nature may be ill. I do not know. But the\r\n_immaterial_ is sound and healthy. It sometimes leaves its grosser\r\ncompanion, and makes discoveries for itself. This is not the first time\r\nit has happened, as you well know. I have been particular in my\r\ndescription, in order that I might convince you that I have actually\r\nbeen there. You know that the description I have given is entirely\r\ndifferent from the appearance of Annie's room in former times. I have\r\nnever heard that she had newly furnished it. Write to her, and ask her\r\nto describe her room to you, and you will find that I have seen all that\r\nI have told you.'\r\n\r\nFinding her so calm, and so willing to reason on what she had seen, I\r\nventured to ask:\r\n\r\n'And what did Ackermann say to her?'\r\n\r\n'Only a very little thing,' said she, with bitter emphasis. 'That he\r\nloved her--and admired me; she stirred the depths of his heart--I\r\nexcited his intellect; she was his darling--I, his sphinx.'\r\n\r\n'Are you sure it is not all a dream?'\r\n\r\n'I have not closed my eyes to-day.'\r\n\r\nI did not know what to say to her. I still thought what she had related\r\nwas but a delusion, but to her it was a reality, and I knew her outward\r\ncalmness was but the expression of intense excitement of mind. Thinking\r\nI might divert her mind, I read to her a letter I had received but a few\r\nminutes before. It was from my sister, who had just returned from\r\nEurope, with her husband and children; and had taken a house in our\r\nnative village. She wished me to come to her at once. At any other time\r\nMiriam would have manifested the greatest interest in this\r\ncommunication. It had been a source of regret to her that I was\r\nseparated from this sister, who was the only near relative I had. Now\r\nshe sat, perfectly unmoved, gazing out into the sunshine as if it\r\nbewildered her. I did not know whether she had heard a word I said. I\r\nlaid down the letter, and took up a book, glancing at her occasionally.\r\nI continued reading for about two hours, while she sat there as if\r\nturned to stone. Then she turned to me and said:\r\n\r\n'Hester, would you not like to see your sister very much?'\r\n\r\n'Very much.'\r\n\r\n'Then let us return home at once.'\r\n\r\n'I am very willing.'\r\n\r\n'Mr. Sydenham leaves here to-morrow night for New York. Let us go with\r\nhim.'\r\n\r\nI hesitated. It seemed such a hasty departure from the friends who had\r\nbeen so kind to us, but a glance at the pale, eager face of Miriam\r\ndecided me. I consented.\r\n\r\nThe nest day brought a letter from Ackermann. Miriam showed it to me. It\r\nwas the only letter of his I was ever permitted to read. It was a good\r\nletter--very lover-like, but earnest and manly. It seemed to me the\r\ntruth of the writer was palpable in every line.\r\n\r\n'Of course this has removed all your doubts,' I said, as I returned the\r\nletter to Miriam.\r\n\r\n'It has not shaken my faith in the evidence of the finest of my senses,'\r\nwas her only reply.\r\n\r\nSince we had left our pretty little village, a railroad track had been\r\nlaid through, it. The depot was near Annie's house. As we had apprised\r\nno one of our arrival, we found ourselves alone on the platform when we\r\nstepped out of the cars.\r\n\r\n'Let us call and see Annie,' said Miriam.\r\n\r\n'Before you visit your father and mother?' said I, surprised.\r\n\r\n'This is the hour Ackermann usually visits her.'\r\n\r\n'I will go with you.'\r\n\r\nIt was but a few minutes' walk. We felt perfectly at home there. We\r\nopened the front door, and walked in without ceremony. No one was in the\r\nfront rooms. We passed quickly through them into the little room at the\r\nfoot of the back stairs. I noticed the furniture as soon as I entered.\r\nIt was new, and was arranged pretty much as Miriam had described it.\r\nAckermann and Annie stood by the window looking into the garden. I am\r\nnot sure, but I think he was holding her hand. They turned as we\r\nentered, and, for a few minutes, were speechless with amazement. Annie\r\nwas the first to recover herself.\r\n\r\n'What a delightful surprise!' she exclaimed, running toward us; but she\r\nstopped before she was half across the room. Something in Miriam's\r\nmanner arrested her. Ackermann's perceptions were quicker. He saw at one\r\nglance that Miriam knew all, and, though very much agitated, he stood,\r\nlooking defiantly at her. She took no notice of Annie, but said to\r\nAckermann:\r\n\r\n'I trusted you. You have deceived me. I believed in your love so fully\r\nthat I would have been yours faithfully until death. You lightly threw\r\nmine away. I thought your words of love so sacred that I kept them hid\r\nin my heart from the sight of the most faithful friends. You have made\r\nmine the subjects of jest. But I do not come here to reproach you.\r\nHenceforth you are nothing to me. I came to demand my ring.'\r\n\r\n'I have no ring of yours,' said he, with calm decision. 'This ring that\r\nI wear you put upon my finger, and told me not to part with it under\r\n_any_ circumstances. You charged me to wear it until death. It is mine.\r\nI will not part with it, even to you.'\r\n\r\nMiriam looked at him incredulously for a moment. Her fortitude began to\r\ngive way.\r\n\r\n'I do not know,' she said slowly, 'why you wish to keep that ring. You\r\ncan never look at it without thinking of me, and of the words of love I\r\nhave spoken to you. It is hateful to me to think that you have anything\r\nto remind you of the past. For this reason I want the ring. I will not\r\nwear it. I will not keep it. I will destroy it utterly. But by the\r\nmemory of my past trust, I beseech you to give me that ring.'\r\n\r\nA sneer curled the lip of Ackermann.\r\n\r\n'I will not give it to you!' he said, decidedly.\r\n\r\nMiriam did not look at him now, but at the ring. It glowed on his hand\r\nlike a flame; for it was set with a cluster of diamonds.\r\n\r\n'It will ruin you,' she said, raising her eyes slowly, and fixing them\r\non his face. 'It will be your curse.'\r\n\r\nShe turned and left the room. Ackermann looked displeased, and annoyed.\r\nAnnie was pale and frightened. I did not know whether to follow Miriam,\r\nor remain to hear Annie's explanations. I finally decided to do neither,\r\nand, walking out of the open window into the garden, I took another\r\nroute to my sister's.\r\n\r\nThey say that no nature is thoroughly evil, that every man has some\r\nredeeming qualities. This is probably true, and I suppose Ackermann had\r\nhis virtues, but I was never able to discover any. The only sides of his\r\ncharacter presented to my observation were evil, and wholly evil. He\r\nloved Annie, it is true, but it was an unnatural, selfish, exacting\r\nlove. Such a love is a curse to any woman, and it was doubly so to\r\nAnnie, who loved him too entirely to see any faults in him, and was too\r\nweak minded to resist his merciless exactions. So thoroughly selfish was\r\nhe that, notwithstanding his love for Annie, he would have married\r\nMiriam if she had not so peremptorily broken the engagement. Miriam was\r\nvery wealthy, while Annie was comparatively poor. Ackermann himself was\r\nworth nothing. Why he persisted in keeping the ring I never knew, unless\r\nit was that Miriam's proud contempt and indifference roused his\r\nmalignant temper to oppose her in the only way which lay in his power.\r\nHe possessed the art of making himself agreeable, and had a very fair\r\nseeming, so that when his engagement to Annie was made public, she was\r\nwarmly congratulated. His former engagement to Miriam was unknown, even\r\nto her own parents.\r\n\r\nI saw but little of Ackermann and Annie, and never met them but in\r\npublic. His wickedness and her weakness made them both contemptible in\r\nmy eyes. And my mind was occupied in other matters. Miriam resolved to\r\nmake the tour of Europe, and I was to accompany her--for she would take\r\nno denial. For many weeks we were busied in preparations for our\r\ndeparture; Miriam had settled all her affairs satisfactorily, and we\r\nwere thinking of making the last farewells, when she was taken ill. The\r\ndoctors said it was an organic disease of the heart. This was an\r\nhereditary disease in the family, but Miriam up to the time of her\r\nacquaintance with Ackermann had been entirely free from any symptom of\r\nit, or of any particular disease whatever. Whether this sudden\r\nexhibition of it was the effect of natural causes, or was produced by\r\nmortified love and pride, I leave the reader to conclude.\r\n\r\nI was her constant attendant during her sickness. She could scarcely\r\nbear me out of her sight. She had never spoken to me of Ackermann since\r\nthe interview in Annie's room. Now she seemed to take delight in talking\r\nabout him, and I was amazed at the intense hatred with which she\r\nregarded him. She was gentle and patient under her sufferings, and\r\ntender and loving at all times, except when speaking of him. Then all\r\nthe bad passions of her nature were aroused. It was in vain that I\r\nrepresented to her that at such a time she should endeavor to be at\r\npeace with all the world, and forgive as she hoped to be forgiven.\r\n\r\n'If I have sinned against my God, as Henry Ackermann has sinned against\r\nme, I neither expect or wish to be forgiven,'--was the only reply she\r\nwould make to such arguments. She had not the slightest feeling of ill\r\nwill against Annie; she spoke of her as a misguided, loving girl; but\r\noften repeated the assertion that Ackermann and Annie would never be\r\nmarried.\r\n\r\nThe physicians were inclined to think that Miriam would recover from\r\nthis attack, but she knew, she said, that she must die, and she exacted\r\na promise from me that I would watch over her body until it was\r\nconsigned to the grave, imploring me not to let indifferent people be\r\nwith her after death. I readily gave the promise, little knowing what a\r\nfearful obligation I was taking upon myself.\r\n\r\nOne morning I left Miriam's bedside, and walked through the village in\r\norder to get some exercise, and breathe the fresh air. I remember the\r\nday well. It was in the latter part of May--a warm, sweet, sunny day,\r\nwith enough of chilliness in the air to give a zest to walking. I was\r\nsurprised at the ripeness and luxuriance of the foliage, so early for a\r\nNew England spring; but I was still more surprised at the aspect of our\r\nusually silent village. The streets were full of men hurrying to and\r\nfro, and groups of men, and women, too, stood at some of the corners. To\r\nmy utter amazement I learned that Annie had disappeared mysteriously the\r\nnight before. She had left home alone early in the evening, saying she\r\nwas going to the river, and had not returned. Search was made for her\r\nduring the night in all the houses of the village; that morning the\r\nriver had been dragged; but not the slightest trace of Annie was\r\nanywhere to be found. Of course everybody was in a state of intense\r\nexcitement. Ackermann was represented to me as almost distracted with\r\ngrief, but he had been active in conducting the search for her.\r\n\r\nI thought it best to tell this to Miriam as soon as I returned. It\r\nproduced a strange effect upon her. It gave her a most intense desire\r\nfor life.\r\n\r\n'I do not desire life for myself,' said she to me, the next day, 'nor\r\nfor any happiness it could confer upon me, for it has no gift that I\r\nvalue; but I wish to live that I may show Ackermann to the world, as he\r\nis, false, and cruel, and revengeful. I feel that I would have the power\r\nto do it, had I but health and strength; but what can a dead body do?\r\nCan the soul return to it again? Where does the soul go?'\r\n\r\nI made no reply to this. I had gone over this ground very often with\r\nMiriam. It was not strange that one who had had such remarkable mental\r\nexperiences should be a believer in spiritual agencies. She was also a\r\nfirm believer in all the doctrines of the Bible, but she always\r\nmaintained that this sacred book nowhere taught that the soul, on its\r\nrelease from the body, went directly to heaven. She argued that it was\r\n_impossible_ for it to go there immediately. Then where did it go? These\r\nideas disposed her to a mystical kind of reading, with which I did not\r\nsympathize, and in which I never indulged.\r\n\r\nI stood at the window some time, looking out, but seeing nothing, for I\r\nwas thinking how strange it was that two girls so entirely opposite as\r\nMiriam and Annie should love the same man, and he so different from\r\nboth. I was aroused by Miriam's voice hurriedly calling me. I hastened\r\nto her side. Never shall I forget her eyes as she fixed them upon me.\r\nThe pupils were dilated, and intensely black, while they shone so\r\nbrilliantly that it seemed as if a fire were burning within them. She\r\nspoke eagerly:\r\n\r\n'Promise me once more, Hester, that you will not leave my body, after\r\nthe soul has left it, until it is laid in the grave, and that you will\r\nnot let idle curiosity come and gaze at it.'\r\n\r\nI readily gave her this promise, thinking it was very little to do for a\r\ndying friend. The unnatural expression faded from her eyes. She seemed\r\nentirely satisfied.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the afternoon that I was aroused from a sound sleep by\r\nthe intelligence that Miriam was dead. She died while asleep, without a\r\nstruggle, or a groan. I called in Mrs. Grove, the housekeeper, who had\r\nbeen devotedly attached to Miriam, and we dressed her in a white robe,\r\nand scattered fragrant flowers around her, to take away, if possible,\r\nthe horror and ghastliness of death. She did not look at all like the\r\nMiriam I had known and loved. Her features were sharp and pinched, and\r\nher face looked careworn, and _anxious_--if anything so lifeless can be\r\nsaid to have expression.\r\n\r\nNo one came into the room that evening but the family, and they retired\r\nearly, and left me alone with the dead. Mrs. Grove sat up all night in\r\nthe dining room, which was separated from Miriam's room by a narrow\r\nentry. She would have remained with me, but I saw that she was very\r\nnervous and timid, and insisted that she should leave me. I could not\r\nunderstand her feeling. I felt not the slightest fear of the inanimate\r\nbody before me, or of the disembodied spirit. She had been my friend\r\nduring her whole life--why should she harm me now?\r\n\r\nI put out the light, and seated myself by the open window at the foot of\r\nthe bed. The round, full moon, in a cloudless sky, made every object in\r\nthe room and out of it as distinct as in the day. I looked at the\r\nfountain, which spun its threads of light under the window; and at the\r\nlittle flowers just peeping above the ground; and at the foliage, with\r\nits many-shaded green; and occasionally I looked at the body stretched\r\nupon the bed. And each time that I looked it seemed to me that it gently\r\nstirred. This did not startle me at all, for I was accustomed to the\r\nappearance of death. Who that has lost a friend does not find it\r\nimpossible to realize that the form is utterly without life? And who has\r\never gazed long at a corpse without fancying that it moved? So again and\r\nagain I looked at Miriam, and again and again I fancied there was a\r\nslight motion, scarcely perceptible. At last the constant repetition of\r\nthis feeling made me uneasy, and to quiet my mind, and satisfy myself\r\nthat it was only _seeming_, I went to the bed and bent over Miriam.\r\n\r\nMy blood ran cold in my veins, as I encountered the eyes of Miriam,\r\nopen, dilated, and black, fixed upon mine! There was a strange light in\r\nthem. It scarcely looked like life, and yet it surely could not be\r\ndeath. It seemed more like a light shining far down some black and deep\r\nsepulchre. Half frenzied with terror, and scarcely knowing what I did, I\r\nforced down the eyelids and shut out that hateful light; but the instant\r\nI removed my fingers the eyes opened upon me again. This time it seemed\r\nthe expression was more life-like--there was _eagerness_ in it. Again I\r\npressed down the eyelids, but now there was resistance to my touch. I\r\ncould feel it. The hands, which had lain quiet on her breast, were\r\nconvulsively raised. I stepped back from the bed, and Miriam sat\r\nupright! Incredible as it may appear, the frenzy of my terror was gone.\r\nMiriam looked like herself. The ghastly pallor of death, the sunken\r\ncheek, the pinched features were all there; but there was something in\r\nthe face which made me think of the Miriam of olden days--the Miriam I\r\nhad known before this last terrible sickness came upon her. I was not\r\nentirely free from fear, but it was a charmed fear. I never thought of\r\ncalling any one. I could do nothing but watch Miriam.\r\n\r\nAfter a few convulsive efforts she got off the bed, and stood erect for\r\na moment. I remember thinking that all this was very strange, and\r\nwondering what she would do next. She moved slowly to the door. I\r\nfollowed her with my eyes. At the door she turned, and looked at me. And\r\nthen there rushed upon my mind the whole weight and responsibility of\r\nthe promise I had made her, that I would never leave her body until it\r\nwas consigned to the tomb! I comprehended that I must follow her, and\r\nmechanically I obeyed the impulse. She took her way through the dining\r\nroom. Mrs. Grove was sitting in an easy-chair, fast asleep. I wondered\r\nhow she could sleep with this awful presence in the room. Miriam did not\r\nglance at her, but passed out of the front door, into the street. My\r\nmind was in a constant state of activity. My will was under the guidance\r\nof Miriam. I had no control over it. My thoughts were my own, and\r\nwandered from object to object. As we were passing down the steps I\r\nthought how beautifully the river would look in the moonlight; but\r\nMiriam turned in an opposite direction from the river, and I was\r\ndisappointed. How fearfully quiet was everything! I would have given\r\nworlds, had I possessed them, if I could have seen a familiar face. I\r\neven had a half-formed thought to scream loudly for help, but I could\r\nnot do it. My will was utterly powerless. We approached the house where\r\nAckermann resided, and I was seized with horror, thinking it possible\r\nthat she might murder him while I witnessed the bloody deed, powerless\r\nto prevent it. But she never once looked at the house while passing it.\r\nThis phantom--whatever it might be--seemed to be entirely free from\r\nhuman feelings. I do not think this idea tended to reassure me, and when\r\nwe left the closely built street, and merged into the open country,\r\nwhere the fields stretched away on every side of us, with no life in\r\nthem, and where loneliness and desolation reigned supreme, I felt a new\r\nterror, and longed to turn, and flee back to human life. But no! I must\r\nfollow my conductress wherever she chose to lead me!\r\n\r\nMiriam walked slowly at first, but had increased her speed as she\r\nproceeded, and now she was walking so swiftly that I could scarcely keep\r\npace with her. I saw white marbles gleaming among the trees at the top\r\nof a hill, and knew that we were approaching the graveyard. It was a\r\ndreary-looking place--a disgrace to the village. The stone wall was in a\r\ndilapidated condition, and in some places there were gaps in it. The\r\ngraves were overgrown with rank weeds, and many old gray tombstones lay\r\non the ground. The gate was swinging loosely on its hinges, and we\r\npassed swiftly through it. And now, thought I, the mystery is solved.\r\nMiriam is going to bury herself, and has brought me to fill the grave,\r\nso that no one may see her body but me, I can never, never do it, if she\r\nfixes those terrible eyes upon me! An open grave lay in our pathway. The\r\nred clay soil, which was heaped around it, was moist. I felt my feet\r\nsink in it as we passed over it--for around the grave we went on our\r\nswift, unerring course--although I knew the grave had been that day dug\r\nfor Miriam! Did she know this? If so, she gave no sign of that\r\nknowledge, and I breathed more freely when we were fairly out of the\r\ngraveyard. On the other side of it was a thick wood, into which I had\r\nnever penetrated. Indeed the thorny thickets, and low, poisonous bushes\r\nmade it impenetrable to any one, and yet it was into this wood that\r\nMiriam led the way. How we pushed through it I do not know. My clothes\r\nwere nearly torn into rags, and so were Miriam's. My flesh was torn also\r\nin several places. I had no means of knowing whether hers was torn also.\r\n\r\nAt last she stopped before a mass of--but my heart grows sick and my\r\nbrain dizzy when I think of that--I cannot describe it, but I knew by\r\nunmistakable evidences that the lost Annie was found!\r\n\r\nI looked at Miriam, but she did not return my glance. I could not see\r\nher face. She stopped only a moment, and continued her walk. And now I\r\nfollowed fearlessly. As soon as I discovered that the phantom had a\r\n_human_ purpose, my terror abated. I was now in a state of feverish\r\nexcitement, wondering what other discoveries would be made. Our way lay\r\nalong the bank of a little brook. The space was more open. The weeds and\r\nbushes had evidently been trampled down, and broken away. Miriam walked\r\nmore slowly, and looked upon the ground. At last she again paused, and\r\npointed with a rigid, bony finger to a little alder twig, which was\r\ntrembling in the breeze. I could see nothing there but a dewdrop\r\nsparkling in the moonlight; but, obeying the impulse of my will, which\r\nwas in obedience to Miriam, I stooped to touch the dewdrop, and instead,\r\nI took off the twig--a ring! It was the diamond ring, which Miriam had\r\ngiven to Ackermann. I clutched it in my hand, and turned to Miriam, but\r\nshe was retracing her steps.\r\n\r\nI remember nothing of the return home. I saw nothing, felt nothing. I\r\nseemed to be sailing through the air, so exhilarated was I. I can\r\ncompare my state to nothing but that of a person who has been taking\r\nether. I took but little notice of Miriam, until we entered the village,\r\nwhen I observed that she walked more slowly. After a time it seemed to\r\nbe an effort to her to walk at all, until finally she tottered, and fell\r\nclose by her own door. I stood an instant, and looked at her. She lay on\r\nthe step, a stiff and rigid corpse. Her eyes were open, but they were\r\nfixed in the glassy stare of death! I ran into the house. Mrs. Grove was\r\nin the dining room, sleeping heavily. I was about to awaken her, when I\r\nremembered that I would have to account for the strange fact of the body\r\nlying at the front door. How could I tell Mrs. Grove, who had showed\r\nherself to be a weak and nervous woman, the wonderful story of our night\r\nwalk? Would she be able to help me if she knew it? I thought of calling\r\nupon Miriam's father, but that seemed horrible. These thoughts rushed\r\nthrough my mind with the rapidity of lightning, and I ran out of the\r\ndoor again, not knowing what to do. A man was standing on the step: I\r\nsuppose he happened to be passing, and stopped in amazement at the\r\nsight; but I did not pause to look at him, or ask him any questions. I\r\nhad no time to give him explanations, for I saw the gray dawn was\r\nbreaking in the eastern sky, and feared that soon other persons might\r\ncome along the street. I gave him a confused and hurried account of how\r\nwe had thought Miriam dead, and how she had walked that far, and fallen;\r\nand I begged him to help me carry her in the house. He consented, and\r\nthen I remembered that there was a side door, which was near Miriam's\r\nroom, and if we carried the body through that we should avoid waking\r\nMrs. Grove. I passed silently through the dining room, and, having\r\nunbolted the door, I returned, and lifted the body of my poor friend in\r\nmy arms, while the stranger raised her head. And thus we carried her in\r\nthe house, and laid her on the bed. I smoothed her dishevelled hair, and\r\narranged her torn dress, forgetting that any one else was in the room,\r\nuntil I was startled by a groan. And then for the first time I looked at\r\nthe stranger. It was Ackermann!\r\n\r\nMy fingers involuntarily closed tighter around the ring, which, all this\r\ntime, I had kept shut up in my hand. Not for the world would I have had\r\nhim to see it then. I was more afraid of him than I had been of Miriam\r\nduring all our journey. She might be called an Avenging Angel. He was a\r\ndestroying Fiend.\r\n\r\nHe trembled violently. He laid his hand heavily upon my arm. It was as\r\ncold as ice, and made a chilly horror creep over me.\r\n\r\n'Tell me, Hester,' he said, in a hoarse voice, 'what is the meaning of\r\nthis? You and Miriam have been farther than the front door, or your\r\nclothes would not be in this cut and ragged condition. Why do you look\r\nat me so strangely--so horribly? Speak to me! Speak!'\r\n\r\nI longed to show him the ring, and confront him then with his horrid\r\ncrimes, but he looked so fiercely I dared not. It is well that I did\r\nnot. I know not what might have been the result. Justice might have been\r\ncheated of her proper prey, and I not have been here to write this tale.\r\nI made my escape from the room, and left him with his dead victim.\r\n\r\nI have a confused recollection of being surrounded with pale and eager\r\nfaces, and of telling them my wonderful story, and showing them the\r\nring. And then I remember nothing more for many hours, for I fell into a\r\nheavy sleep.\r\n\r\nThat night, so full of horrors, did not turn my hair white, or make me\r\nill, or cause me to lose my reason. I was subject to a nervous\r\nirritability for some time afterward, but that passed away, and the only\r\nfeeling I have left to remind me of that terrible night is my aversion\r\nto sit up with a dead body. I have never done it since.\r\n\r\nThe route that Miriam and I had followed was carefully traced. Our\r\ntracks were not discernible until the graveyard was nearly reached.\r\nThere they found the print of our shoes in the wet gravel; and in the\r\nloose soil around the newly dug grave. On Annie was found a note from\r\nAckermann appointing a meeting with her on that evening when she had so\r\nmysteriously disappeared.\r\n\r\nAckermann was arrested and brought to trial. When he learned the nature\r\nof the evidence against him it seemed to fill him with a superstitious\r\nhorror, which drew from him a full confession of his guilt, although, at\r\nfirst, he protested his innocence. He gave in his confession, and met\r\nhis ignominious death with the same bold front and reckless daring he\r\nhad manifested during all his life.\r\n\r\nIt only remains to tell how Ackermann was led to murder a woman he\r\nloved--for he certainly loved Annie. It seems that Annie, in her light,\r\ntrifling way, had seriously wounded him by flirting with one of her\r\nformer suitors. He remonstrated, but his evident distress only urged the\r\ngiddy girl to further trials of her power. And she had an object in\r\narousing his jealousy, for she too was jealous of Miriam's ring. He\r\npersisted in wearing it, notwithstanding her entreaties, and she feared\r\nsome lingering affection for the giver gave rise to the reluctance to\r\npart with the gift. On the night of the murder, high words had passed\r\nbetween them in regard to it. In the heat of the discussion, Annie had\r\nmanaged dexterously to slip the ring off his finger. He struggled to\r\nregain it. She threw it away. The quarrel now grew more violent, until\r\nat last, in his rage, and as unconscious of what he was doing as an\r\nintoxicated man, he struck the fatal blow, and Annie fell dead at his\r\nfeet. In the midst of his horror and remorse--for even he was filled\r\nwith horror at such a deed--he thought of himself, and provided for his\r\nsafety by hiding the body among the thorny and poisonous bushes, knowing\r\nit would be more unlikely to be found there than if he threw it into the\r\nriver, or dug a grave for it. Creeping carefully in and out among the\r\nthick, thorny bushes, so as to disarrange them as little as possible, he\r\nfirst deposited his dead burden, and then returned to the place of the\r\nlast fatal struggle, that he might look for the lost ring.\r\n\r\nThe moon had risen, and he could see every object with great\r\ndistinctness. He looked carefully along the ground, pushing aside the\r\nweeds, and removing every stone under which it might have rolled. After\r\na few minutes' search he became conscious that some one else was looking\r\nfor the ring! He was angry with himself for entertaining such a\r\ndelusion; but still, in spite of his efforts to get rid of it, the\r\nfeeling continued. He had a dim and vague idea that something impalpable\r\nwas near him, now by his side, now before him, _never behind him_,\r\nlooking as eagerly and as anxiously as himself for the lost diamonds. He\r\ninwardly cursed his own cowardice, for he thought this apparition was\r\nborn from his guilty conscience, and he determined to pay no heed to it.\r\n\r\nAt last he approached a cluster of alder bushes, which he now remembered\r\nto have been the place where Annie threw away the ring. He was about to\r\ncommence a search among these, when suddenly Miriam stood between him\r\nand the bushes. He saw her distinctly for a moment, and then she\r\nvanished from his gaze. He pursued her in the direction she had taken,\r\nbut no trace of her could he find. Then, recollecting how very ill she\r\nwas, he became convinced that he had become subject to an optical\r\nillusion. But he had now become fearful and nervous, and dared not\r\nreturn to the spot to renew the search. And thus it was that the ring\r\nwas left upon the twig of alder to bear witness against him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNAPOLEON'S TOMB.\r\n\r\n_Written by_ HON. ROBERT J. WALKER (_then a student_) _in 1821,\r\non hearing of the death of Napoleon_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  See where amid the Ocean's surging tide\r\n  A little island lifts its desert side,\r\n  Where storms on storms in ceaseless torrents pour,\r\n  And howling billows lash its rocky shore--\r\n  There lies Napoleon in his island tomb:\r\n  Nations combined to antedate his doom.\r\n  Mars nursed the infant in a thundercloud,\r\n  France gave him empire, Britain wrought his shroud.\r\n  Danger and glory claimed him as their own,\r\n  And Fortune marked him as her favorite son;\r\n  Science seemed dozing in eternal sleep,\r\n  And superstition brooded o'er the deep;\r\n  Black was the midnight of the human soul,\r\n  Such Gothic darkness shrouds the icy pole:\r\n  Napoleon bade his conquering legions pour\r\n  The blaze of battle on from shore to shore:\r\n  Though blood and havoc marked the victor's way,\r\n  Blest Science shed her genial ray.\r\n  Betrayed, not conquered, round the hero's sleep\r\n  The Arts shall mourn, and Genius vigil keep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DESTINY OF THE AFRICAN RACE IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany persons may be disposed to receive with a large share of scepticism\r\nthe affirmation that there is an aspect of the 'negro question,' which\r\nhas not, within the last thirty years of ceaseless agitation, undergone\r\na thorough discussion. Yet such an assertion would be perfectly true.\r\nThere is one side of that question, at which, during all the fierce\r\nexcitements of the time, we have scarcely looked; and which many, even\r\nthose who have taken an active and leading part in the controversy, have\r\nnot carefully studied.\r\n\r\nThe morality of our system of slavery has been fully and thoroughly\r\ndiscussed, and may be considered as finally and forever settled, in the\r\njudgment of all right-minded and impartial men throughout Christendom.\r\nIt may henceforth be taken as the _consensus omnium gentium_, that men\r\nand women, with their children and their children's children forever,\r\ncannot rightfully be made, by human laws, chattels personal and articles\r\nof merchandise.\r\n\r\nThe economy of slavery has been discussed. Its relations to wealth, to\r\nindustry, to commerce, manufactures, and the arts, as well as to\r\neducation, public intelligence, and public morals, are so well\r\nunderstood, that it is not probable that the efforts even of Jefferson\r\nDavis, or the whole 'Southern confederacy,' with the aid of such\r\ntransatlantic allies as the London _Times_, will be able, in respect to\r\nsuch matters as these, to change or even to unsettle the judgment of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nBut there is another class of questions on which the public mind is as\r\nunthoughtful and unenlightened, as in respect to these it is thoughtful\r\nand intelligent. We have pretty well considered what consequences may be\r\nexpected from the continuance of slavery; but we have neglected to\r\ninquire, on the supposition of the emancipation of the negro, what will\r\nbe his condition, what his future, and what his influence on our\r\nnational destiny. Upon such questions as these, we have, during the\r\ncontroversy, dogmatized much, and thought little. They have called forth\r\nmany outbursts of passion, but very little calm, thoughtful discussion.\r\n\r\nThere is no lack of earnest and confident opinions in the public mind in\r\nrelation to this class of questions. It is in respect to this very side\r\nof the negro question, that prejudices the most intense and inveterate\r\nare widely prevalent; prejudices, too, which have exerted the most\r\ndecisive influence on the controversy, through every stage of its\r\nprogress. The masses of the American people believe in those principles\r\nof political equality upon which all our constitutions are founded. They\r\nnot only believe in them, but they cherish and love them. They perceive,\r\ntoo, by a kind of instinct, what many a would-be philosopher has failed\r\nto see, that the application and carrying out of those principles\r\nnecessarily involve the fusion of the entire mass to which they are\r\napplied, into one homogeneous whole; that we cannot have a government\r\nfounded on political equality, consistently with our having an inferior\r\nand proscribed class of citizens; a class from whose daughters our sons\r\nmay not take their wives, and to whose sons we are not willing, either\r\nin this or in any future generation, to give our daughters in marriage.\r\nPolitical equality implies that the son of any parents may be raised to\r\nthe highest offices in the government, and wear the most brilliant\r\nhonors which a free people can confer. And the masses of the people\r\ninstinctively see, or rather feel, that it is impossible to admit to\r\nsuch equality a class to whom we deny, and always intend to deny all\r\nequality in the social state; and with whom we are shocked at the very\r\nthought of ever uniting our race and our blood.\r\n\r\nI am not now saying where the moral right of this matter lies; or\r\nwhether, in this inveterate hostility to a social equality with the\r\nnegro, the masses of the people are right or wrong. I am only affirming,\r\nwhat certainly cannot be successfully denied, that while they retain and\r\ncherish it, they will never be willing to apply to him this doctrine of\r\npolitical equality. They will always resist it, as carrying with it, by\r\ninevitable consequence, that social equality to which they are\r\ndetermined never to submit. If the doctrine of political equality, so\r\nfundamental, to our system of government, is ever to be extended so as\r\nto embrace the colored man, it can only be done by overcoming and\r\nutterly obliterating this social aversion.\r\n\r\nIf it were proved to be ever so desirable to effect such a change in the\r\ntastes and prejudices of the American people, history does not lend any\r\ncountenance to the belief that it is possible. Wherever one people has\r\nconquered another, the conquerors and their descendants have always\r\nasserted for themselves a political superiority for ages; and that\r\npolitical superiority has extended itself into all the relations of\r\nsocial life. This has taken place with such uniformity, as to impress\r\nupon the mind the belief that it occurs in obedience to some great law\r\nof human nature, which may be expected to baffle all attempts at\r\nresistance in the future, as it has done in the past. The testimony of\r\nhistory is, that equality can be the law of national life only when the\r\nnation was originally formed from equal elements. But two peoples never\r\nmet on the same soil, and under the same government, under conditions so\r\nwidely unequal as the European and the African populations of this\r\ncountry. The Europeans are, to a great extent, the descendants of the\r\nmost enlightened men of the world, heirs by birth to the highest\r\ncivilization of the nineteenth century. The Africans, on the contrary,\r\nare the known descendants of parents who were taken by force from their\r\nown country, and brought hither as merchandise, sold as chattels and\r\nbeasts of burden to the highest bidder; and have even now no\r\ncivilization except what they have acquired in this condition of abject\r\nslavery; separated, too, from the dominant class, not only by this\r\nstigma of slavery, but by complexion and features so marked and\r\npeculiar, that a small taint of the blood of the servile class can be\r\ndetected with unerring certainty. If history decides anything, it is\r\nthat a system of political equality cannot be formed out of such\r\nelements. The experience of the world is against it.\r\n\r\nThis deeply seated aversion to the recognition of the equality of the\r\nwhite man and the black man is a potent force, which has been\r\nincessantly active in all our history, and furnishes the only\r\nsatisfactory explanation of the fact that slavery did not perish, at\r\nleast from all the Northern slave-holding States, long ago. There is,\r\nespecially in the Border Slave States, a large non-slave-holding class,\r\nwho know that the existence of slavery is utterly prejudicial to their\r\ninterests and destructive of their prosperity as free laborers. They are\r\nso keenly sensible of this, that they regard with almost equal hatred\r\nthe system of slavery, the negro, and the slave owner. But one\r\nconsideration, which is never absent from their minds, always prevails,\r\neven over their regard for their own interests, and receives their\r\nsteady and invariable coöperation with the slave owner in perpetuating\r\nthe enslavement of the colored man. That consideration is the dread of\r\nnegro equality. If, say they, the colored man becomes a freeman, then\r\nwhy not entitled to all the privileges and franchises which other\r\nfreemen enjoy? And if admitted to political, then surely to social\r\nequality also.\r\n\r\nAnd to many it seems perfectly clear that the universal emancipation of\r\nthe negro carries with it by inevitable necessity his admission to the\r\nfull enjoyment of all equality, political and social, and his becoming\r\nhomogeneous with the mass of the American people; and the fact that they\r\nthink so is the only adequate explanation of the inflexible energy of\r\nwill with which they resist all measures which are supposed to tend in\r\nthe smallest degree toward emancipation. And they think themselves able\r\nto give unanswerable reasons for the bitterness with which they note\r\neverything which is expressed by the word 'abolitionism.' They assume it\r\nfor a fact, which admits no contradiction, that the natural increase of\r\nthe negro race in this country is more rapid than that of the white man.\r\nSo far as my observation extends, the great majority of the people\r\nbelieve this with an undoubting faith. It is constantly asserted in\r\nconversation, and in the most exaggerated form in newspaper paragraphs;\r\nalthough (as I shall presently show) a mere glance at our census tables\r\ndisproves it. It is also assumed, with a faith equally undoubting, that\r\nif the slaves were all emancipated, the negro race would still increase\r\nas rapidly in freedom as in slavery. Emancipation, it is said, would at\r\nonce cast upon the country four millions and a half of free negroes; and\r\nby the rapidity of their increase, they would, at no distant day, become\r\na majority of the whole population.\r\n\r\nIf then, it is further argued, you emancipate them, and yet withhold\r\nfrom them a full participation in all our political privileges, they\r\nwill be hostile to our government, a great nation of aliens in the midst\r\nof us, who would be the natural enemies of our institutions. An\r\ninternecine war of races, it is said, must follow. Even here it would be\r\nwell for persons who entertain such gloomy apprehensions, to remember\r\nthat if these assumptions were all true (though I will show in the\r\nsequel that they are not), even then, emancipation could not make of the\r\nnegroes more dangerous enemies to our institutions than slavery has made\r\nof the masters. It is also said that the only possible mode of escaping\r\nall these horrible results, would be to admit the negro, if he must be\r\nfreed, to all the privileges and franchises of the Constitution, and\r\namalgamate him entirely with the mass of American society. Thus it is\r\ntaken for proved that emancipation would carry with it the equality of\r\nthe negro and the white man in all their relations.\r\n\r\nI believe it to be true beyond reasonable doubt, that the great majority\r\nof the American people do at this time accept this substantially as\r\ntheir creed on the question of emancipation. They do not mean to justify\r\nslavery; they abhor and hate it; they regard it as economically,\r\nsocially, politically, and morally wrong. But they regard emancipation\r\nas tending directly and inevitably to incorporate the negro into the\r\nmass of American society, and compel us to treat him as homogeneous with\r\nit. To such a solution of the question they feel an unconquerable\r\naversion. It shocks their taste; it violates their notions of propriety\r\nand fitness; they resist it by a sort of instinct, rather than from set\r\nconviction and purpose.\r\n\r\nNor is there one man in a thousand of us, who is not conscious in\r\nhimself of a certain degree of sympathy with this view of the subject,\r\nhowever much we may think that we morally disapprove it. With enslaving\r\nthe negro, and reducing him to an article of merchandise, or depriving\r\nhim of one of those moral rights which God has given him as a man, we\r\nhave no sympathy. But if, in full view of a proposition to break down\r\nall the social barriers which now divide the races, so that our\r\ndescendants and those of the colored man shall form one homogeneous\r\npeople, we interrogate our own consciousness, we shall discover that\r\nwe, even those of us who have most eloquently and indignantly denounced\r\n'prejudice against color,' are compelled to own ourselves in sympathy\r\nwith the great mass of the American people, in utter and unconquerable\r\naversion to such an arrangement.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that this article may fall into the hands of some friends\r\nof mine whose judgment I greatly respect, and whose feelings I should be\r\nmost reluctant to wound, to whom these sentiments will at first view be\r\nfar from agreeable. But for many years I have entertained them with\r\nundoubting confidence of their truth; and at this solemn crisis of our\r\nnation's destiny it becomes us to lay aside all our prejudices, and to\r\nendeavor to reach the truth on this momentous question. I repeat it:\r\nthis side of the subject has not been fairly met and considered in this\r\ndiscussion. The time has come when we must meet it. Emancipation is an\r\nindispensable condition of the restoration and perpetuity of the Union,\r\nperhaps even of our continued national existence. The one great\r\nobjection to emancipation, in the minds of the people, North and South,\r\nis the belief, so confidently and even obstinately entertained, that it\r\ncarries with it as an inevitable consequence, either an internecine war\r\nof races, which would destroy us, or the amalgamation of our race and\r\nblood with that of the negro. If we mean, as practical men and\r\nstatesmen, to seek our country's salvation by means of emancipation, we\r\nmust, in some way, relieve the national mind from the pressure of this\r\nobjection. Till we do so, the masses of the people will say to us: 'We\r\ndo not approve of slavery; we abhor it; but if we are to have the negro\r\namong us, we believe in keeping him in slavery.' All of us, who are in\r\nthe habit of talking with the people on this subject, know that almost\r\nin these very words we are met at every street corner. We must answer\r\nit, or in some form slavery will still continue to be the curse of our\r\ncountry, and to hurry it on to an untimely and ignominious end.\r\n\r\nLet it be distinctly borne in mind that it is not the _moral_ equality\r\nof the negro to the white man, which is under consideration. That indeed\r\nis only indirectly assailed by the inveterate national prejudice of\r\nwhich I speak. Those masses of the people who have no pecuniary interest\r\nin slavery, trample on the moral rights of the colored man only because\r\nthey are made to believe themselves placed under the hard necessity of\r\ndoing so, in order to resist any approach toward that political and\r\nsocial equality with him to which they are determined never to submit.\r\nShow them how they can concede to him the former without conceding the\r\nlatter, and they will gladly do it. For myself, nothing can be added to\r\nthe intensity of my conviction not only that the colored man must be\r\nprotected in the full enjoyment of all the moral rights of humanity, as\r\na condition of our prolonged national existence; but that the masses of\r\nthe people never will consent to a political and social equality with\r\nthe negro race.\r\n\r\nHow then can the public mind be assured that to emancipate the enslaved\r\nrace, to confer on them all the moral rights of humanity, does not\r\ninvolve by any necessity or even remote probability, either an\r\ninternecine war of races on our own soil, or the fusion of the two races\r\ninto one homogeneous people? One answer, which satisfies many, is, the\r\nfreedmen must be colonized in some unoccupied region of the earth, where\r\nthey may be separated from the white man, and build up for themselves an\r\nindependent and homogeneous nationality. I have no controversy with this\r\nproposed solution of the difficulty, or with the excellent men who are\r\nadvocating and promoting it, with an earnest patriotism worthy of all\r\nhonor. But I have grave doubts of the adequacy of this solution to meet\r\nthe momentous exigencies of the present crisis. At least, I feel no\r\nnecessity of resting the whole cause upon it, when there is another\r\nsolution at hand, which certainly is adequate, furnished by the very\r\nlaws of nature which the Creator has established, and so certain in its\r\noperation, that we have only to strike the fetters from the limbs of the\r\npoor slave, and recognize his manhood, and God will take care of the\r\nrest, and protect our country from the evils we have so much dreaded.\r\n\r\nThat solution is found in a great law of population. It is necessary,\r\ntherefore, that I should state this law, and prove its reality, and its\r\nadequacy to meet all the necessities of the case in hand.\r\n\r\nWhenever two peoples, one of which is little removed from barbarism, and\r\nthe other having the full strength of a mature civilization, are placed\r\nin juxtaposition with each other, on terms of free labor and free\r\ncompetition, the stronger will always either amalgamate itself with the\r\nweaker, or extinguish it. In the former case, civilization undergoes an\r\neclipse, almost an extinction. The homogeneous people resulting from\r\nsuch a union, occupies a position in the scale of civilization much\r\nnearer to that of their barbarous than that of their civilized parents.\r\nNumerous and conclusive examples of this have occurred in the progress\r\nof the French, Spanish, and Portuguese colonies in proximity to the\r\nvarious native tribes of this continent. They have generally amalgamated\r\nfreely with their savage neighbors; and a deep eclipse of civilization\r\nhas in every instance resulted. When that eclipse is to end, we have not\r\nthe foresight to determine.\r\n\r\nThe English colonies, on the other hand, in all parts of the world, have\r\nsteadily refused to enter into any marriage relations with their\r\nbarbarous neighbors, or to recognize as belonging to their community any\r\nhalf-breeds springing from licentious and illicit connection with them.\r\nHere, too, the results are almost entirely uniform. The extinction of\r\nsuch barbarous tribes brought within the sphere of their competition has\r\nbeen rapid and almost if not absolutely invariable; while the English\r\ncolonies themselves have preserved the civilization of the parent stock\r\nin almost undiminished vigor.\r\n\r\nA mere general view of the history of European colonization in barbarous\r\nregions of the earth, does therefore afford a very striking proof of the\r\ntruth of my proposition. And it is much to our purpose here to remark,\r\nthat the very aversion to incorporating the negro into our nationality,\r\nwhich is so firmly fixed in the minds of the masses of the people, is no\r\nnew thing in our history, and no outgrowth of slavery. It is the same\r\nnational characteristic which, in all parts of the world, has prevented\r\nthe English colonist from intermarrying with his barbarous neighbor.\r\nCall it by what hard name you please, call it 'prejudice against color,'\r\nand denounce it as eloquently and indignantly as you may, it is one of\r\nthe most remarkable and one of the most respectable features of the\r\nEnglish colonies wherever found, and one of the chief causes of their\r\npreëminence over those of other European nations, in civilization,\r\nwealth, and power. But what it is chiefly to our purpose to remark is,\r\nthat while it is to the colonies themselves the cause of unequalled\r\nprosperity and rapidity of growth in all the elements of national\r\ngreatness, to their savage neighbors it is the cause of rapid and\r\ncertain extinction.\r\n\r\nPrecisely in such relations to each other will the white and colored\r\npopulations of the United States be placed by an act of universal\r\nemancipation, the substitution of free labor and free competition for\r\nthe compulsory power of the master. And while on the one hand the\r\nhistory of the colonial off-shoots of England shows that the\r\namalgamation of the races will not follow, it shows with equal clearness\r\nand certainty that the rapid extinction of the colored race will\r\nfollow. Here I might rest the whole argument, with a high degree of\r\nassurance of the soundness and certainty of my conclusion, that the\r\nresult of emancipation must be, not the amalgamation of the races, not\r\nan internecine war between them, but the inevitable extinction of the\r\nweaker race by the competition of the stronger. I say the _competition_\r\nof the stronger, because, to avoid extending this article to a very\r\nunreasonable length, I must assume that the reader is sufficiently\r\nversed in American history to know that even the Indian perishes, for\r\nthe most part, not by the sword or the rifle of the white man, but by\r\nthe simple competition of civilization with the Indian's means of\r\nsubsistence.\r\n\r\nI might, I say, leave my argument here; but to do so would be great\r\ninjustice to the subject. There are abundant and unquestionable facts,\r\nwhich show to a demonstration, that the case of the negro in his\r\nrelations to the European population of this country is embraced in the\r\nlaw just stated.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the two races are not amalgamated. Intermarriages\r\nbetween them are so rare, that few of the readers of this article can\r\nremember ever to have known one. Such marriages are regarded as\r\nmonstrous and disgraceful, though the law should, as in some of the\r\nStates, recognize them. One sentiment in respect to them pervades the\r\nwhole community, and that a sentiment of aversion. Those half-breeds\r\nwhich spring from licentiousness, or even from the very few lawful\r\nmarriages which have occurred, are not accepted as standing in any\r\nnearer relations to the white man than the pure-blooded African. In\r\nthose States where slavery has been longest extinct, and the colored man\r\nhas been relieved from all legal disabilities, the line between the two\r\nraces is as sharply drawn to-day as it was two hundred years ago. On\r\nsuch a question two hundred years and more is long enough for an\r\nexperiment. The experiment already tried does prove that the\r\nAnglo-American and African populations of this country cannot be\r\namalgamated, either by freedom or slavery; and those who pretend to fear\r\nit, are either trying to deceive others for selfish and criminal\r\npurposes, or else they are wofully deceived themselves.\r\n\r\nNor are the apprehensions of those who dread the rapid increase of the\r\nnegro, at all sustained by facts. That fear of a coming internecine war\r\nof races, in case the colored man is emancipated, which haunts some\r\nminds, has no foundation except in ignorance of the real facts. In no\r\nportion of our history has our colored population ever increased with a\r\nrapidity nearly so great as the white population. From 1790 to 1860 the\r\ncolored population increased in the ratio of 1 to 5.86; and the white\r\npopulation in the ratio of 1 to 8.50. If we compare them for any shorter\r\nperiod, we shall always find that the white population increased the\r\nmore rapidly of the two. From 1790 to 1808, we might perhaps expect to\r\nfind it otherwise; for during that period the slave trade was in full\r\nactivity, and tens of thousands of Africans were imported as articles of\r\nmerchandise. But from 1790 to 1810, while the colored population\r\nincreased in the ratio of 1 to 1.81, the white population increased in\r\nthe ratio of 1 to 1.84, although during that period the white population\r\nof the country was very little increased by immigration. How it has\r\nhappened that this point, which our tables of population make so\r\nentirely plain, has been so much misapprehended, and why the prevailing\r\nnotions respecting it are so erroneous, is not easy to explain. The\r\nabove estimate also reckons all half breeds as belonging to the colored\r\npopulation. (See De Bow's 'Compendium of the United States Census of\r\n1850,' Tables 18, 42, and 71.)\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. A careful examination of Tables 42 and 71 of the\r\nvolume above referred to, will show that the increase of the colored\r\nrace in freedom is certainly not half so great as in slavery. Indeed\r\nthere is great reason to doubt whether our colored population has ever\r\nincreased at all, except in slavery. From 1790 to 1800 the free colored\r\npopulation almost doubled, evidently by the emancipation of slaves; for\r\nduring that period the slave population of Connecticut, Delaware, New\r\nHampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont was greatly\r\ndiminished, while that of New Jersey and Maryland was very little\r\nincreased. In the last mentioned the increase of her slave population\r\nwas only 21/2 per cent. in ten years, while the increase of her free\r\ncolored population was 1431/2 per cent. in the same period. These\r\nfigures leave no room for doubt that the rapid increase of the free\r\ncolored population in all that decade was caused by the fact that the\r\ngreat mass of the people were honestly opposed to slavery, and therefore\r\nthe work of emancipation went on with rapidity.\r\n\r\nFrom 1800 to 1810 the increase of the free colored population was 72 per\r\ncent., under the continued though somewhat slackened operation of the\r\nsame cause. From 1810 to 1820 the increase had declined from 72 to 25\r\nper cent.; for the very obvious reason that most of the Northern States\r\nhad now no slaves to emancipate, while the Southern States were holding\r\nto the system of slavery with increased tenacity, and emancipation was\r\nbecoming less frequent. From 1820 to 1830 the ratio of increase was\r\nagain raised to 37 per cent. in ten years. By referring again to Table\r\n71, it will be seen that in that decade, New York and New Jersey\r\nemancipated more than 15,000 slaves, adding them to the free colored\r\npopulation. From 1830 to 1840 the rate of increase declined to 21 per\r\ncent., and from 1840 to 1850 to only 121/4 per cent., and to 10 per\r\ncent. from 1850 to 1860.\r\n\r\nThese figures prove that from 1790 to 1840 the increase of the free\r\ncolored population depended chiefly on the emancipation of slaves, and\r\nleave no reason to believe that its own natural increase ever exceeded\r\n121/4 per cent. in ten years; while the average increase of the slave\r\npopulation is nearly 28 per cent. in ten years, and of the white\r\npopulation 34 per cent. in ten years. Thus, beyond controversy, the\r\nreproductive power of the colored population, always greatly inferior to\r\nthat of the white population, is yet not half so great in freedom as in\r\nslavery. This difference is to be accounted for in great measure by the\r\nwicked and beastly stimulus applied to the increase of slaves, that the\r\nchattel market may be kept supplied.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to suppose that the increase of the free colored\r\npopulation would be in a greater ratio if all were emancipated; but, as\r\nwill appear from considerations yet to be presented, much for supposing\r\nthat it would be in a much smaller ratio. How then would the case stand\r\non that supposition? In 1860 there were about 27,000,000 of our white\r\npopulation, increasing at the rate of 34 per cent. in ten years; and\r\nless than 4,500,000 of colored population, increasing (on the\r\nsupposition of universal freedom) in a ratio not exceeding 121/4 per\r\ncent. in ten years. Surely, that must be a very timid man who, in this\r\nrelation of the parties, fears anything from the increase of free\r\nnegroes. A war between these two races, so related to each other, is\r\nsimply absurd, and the fear of it childish and cowardly. Slavery may\r\nmultiply the colored population till its numbers shall become alarming;\r\nbut if we will give freedom to the black man, we have nothing to fear\r\nfrom his increase.\r\n\r\nBut this certainly is not the full strength of the case. There is no\r\ngood reason to believe that the natural increase of the free colored\r\npopulation is even 121/4 per cent. in ten years, but much for\r\nsuspecting that even this apparent increase is the result of\r\nemancipation, either by the slave's own act, or by the consent of the\r\nmaster. If we take our departure from Chicago, make the tour of the\r\nlakes to the point where the boundary line of New York and Pennsylvania\r\nintersects the shore of Lake Erie, thence pass along the southern\r\nboundary of New York, till it intersects the Hudson river, thence along\r\nthat river and the Atlantic coast to the southern boundary of Virginia,\r\nthence along the southern boundaries of Virginia and Kentucky to the\r\nMississippi, thence along that river to the point where the northern\r\nboundary of Illinois intersects it, and thence along that boundary and\r\nthe shore of Lake Michigan to the place of departure, we shall have\r\nembraced within the line described ten of the thirty-four States of the\r\nUnion. By an examination of Table 42, already referred to, it will be\r\nseen that outside of those ten States the free colored population not\r\nonly did not increase between 1840 and 1850, but actually diminished,\r\nand that all the increase of that decade was in those ten States.\r\n\r\nWhy then was there an increase in those ten States, while in the other\r\ntwenty-four there was an actual decrease? I think this question can only\r\nbe answered by ascribing that increase to emancipation. In Kentucky,\r\nVirginia, Maryland, and Delaware, slavery is unprofitable and declining,\r\nand acts of emancipation frequently occur. Pennsylvania and New Jersey,\r\nbefore the passage of the fugitive slave law of 1850, were favorite\r\nresorts of fugitives, perhaps partly on account of the known sympathies\r\nof the Quakers. Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, were also resorted to by\r\nfugitives, both on account of their easy accessibility from adjacent\r\nSlave States, and their proximity to Canada, and also because such labor\r\nas a fugitive from slavery is best able to do, is there always in\r\ndemand. These States have also received thousands of colored persons,\r\nbrought to them by humane and conscientious masters, for the very\r\npurpose of emancipating them.\r\n\r\nFrom 1850 to 1860 the facts are still more striking. The increase which\r\noccurred was not, as would have been true of a natural increase,\r\nscattered over our whole territory, and in some proportion to the\r\ncolored population previously existing, but almost wholly, either where\r\nthe unprofitableness and decline of slavery was leading to emancipation,\r\nor where from any cause the fugitive slave law of 1850 was not strictly\r\nenforced. Examples of the former are Maryland, Virginia, and Missouri,\r\nand of the latter are Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, Iowa, and even\r\nMassachusetts and Connecticut, in the latter of which it had been\r\ndeclining for twenty years previous.\r\n\r\nWith the facts before us, then, furnished by the United States Census,\r\nfrom 1790 to 1860, how is it possible to believe that the colored\r\npopulation of this country has ever increased at all, except hi slavery?\r\nHow can we help seeing that it is slavery, and slavery alone, which has\r\nswelled their numbers from a little more than half a million, as it was\r\nin 1790, to near four and a half millions at the present time? Yet there\r\nare millions among us that turn pale at the thought of emancipation,\r\nlest thereby we should be overrun by the multiplication of the colored\r\nrace! There are millions who would be thought intelligent men, who think\r\nthey have propounded an unanswerable argument against emancipation When\r\nthey have asked, 'What will you do with the negro?' We may well ask what\r\nshall we do with the negro, if we continue to multiply the race in\r\nslavery as beasts of burden and articles of merchandise. But on the\r\nsupposition of freedom, the question has no significance. The men who\r\nare always scaring themselves and others by such fears are either very\r\nignorant or very hypocritical.\r\n\r\nBut the case will be still stronger when we come to inquire, as we must\r\nbefore we close, into the causes of the facts which have just been\r\npresented. There is no reason to believe that the slower increase of the\r\ncolored race is at all due to any original inferiority in the powers of\r\nreproduction, or that any such inferiority exists. Its causes are to be\r\nfound wholly in the different circumstances, characters, and habits of\r\nthe two peoples. The negro is, to a great extent, a barbarian in the\r\nmidst of civilization. He is destitute of those comforts of life, that\r\ncare, skill, and intelligent watchfulness, which are indispensable to\r\nsuccess in rearing children in the midst of the dangers, exposures, and\r\ndiseases of infancy. His dwelling does not afford the necessary\r\nprotection from the cold and storms of winter, or from the heats of\r\nsummer: it is ill warmed and ill ventilated; he has not an unfailing\r\nsupply of food and clothing suited to the wants of that most frail and\r\ndelicate of living creatures, a human infant. Hence a large portion of\r\nhis children die in infancy.\r\n\r\nOn the last page of the Appendix to the volume already referred to, is a\r\nmost instructive table, showing the truth of this operation. Thus in\r\n1850 the white population of Alabama was 426,514; the colored\r\npopulation, slave and free, was 365,109. In that year the deaths of\r\nwhite children under five years of age were 1,650; of colored children,\r\n2,463. That is, only two thirds as many white children died as colored;\r\nand yet the white population was greater almost in the ratio of 7 to 6.\r\nBy running the eye down the table, it will be seen that similar facts\r\nexist in every State where there is a large colored population. These\r\nfacts leave us in no doubt as to the reason why the increase of the\r\ncolored population is always slower than that of the white population.\r\n\r\nThis occurs, as the table just referred to shows, under slavery, where\r\nthe pecuniary interest of the master will secure his watchful\r\ncoöperation with the parent to preserve the life of the infant. But in\r\nfreedom the same causes act upon the colored race with vastly more\r\ndestructive effect. The preservation of infant life and health is then\r\nleft solely to the care, skill, and resources of the parent. The result\r\nis that decay of the colored race which we have seen indicated in the\r\ncensus. It is essential to our purpose that this point should be made\r\nquite plain.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that there is in every community a lower stratum of\r\npopulation, in which wages are sufficient to support the individual\r\nlaborer in comfort, but not sufficient for the support of a family. This\r\nnot only always has been so, but it always must be, as long as\r\ncompetition continues to be the test of value; and competition must\r\ncontinue to be the test of value as long as the individual right of\r\nproperty is protected and preserved. Nor is this, as many superficial\r\nthinkers of our day have thought it, merely the hard and selfish rule by\r\nwhich Shylock oppresses and grinds the face of his victim: it is a\r\nnecessary and beneficent law of the best forms of society which can ever\r\nexist in this world. The welfare of society in all the future\r\nimperatively requires that it should be propagated from the strong, the\r\nsound, the healthy, both in body and mind, from the strongest, most\r\nvigorous, and noblest specimens of the race; and not from the diseased,\r\nthe weak, the vicious, the degraded, the broken-down classes. Thus only\r\ncan the life and health of society be preserved age after age. This is\r\nas necessary as it is that the farmer should propagate his domestic\r\nanimals from the finest of his stock, and not from the diminutive, the\r\nweak, and the sickly. And it is accomplished in well ordered society by\r\nthat very law of wages just stated. As a general rule, it is the very\r\npersons who are unfit to be the parents of the coming generation, that\r\nare thrown into that lower stratum where wages are insufficient for the\r\nsupport of a family. And just in proportion as the entire structure of\r\nsociety is pervaded by intelligence and virtue, this class of persons\r\nwill abstain from marriage, by prudently considering that they have not\r\na satisfactory prospect of being able to support a family. It is thus\r\nonly that the horrors of extreme poverty can be avoided at the bottom of\r\nthe social pyramid. The severity of this law of wages and population can\r\nthus be greatly mitigated and the comforts of life be universally\r\nenjoyed; but the law itself is necessary and beneficent, and never can\r\nbe repealed till human nature and human society are constructed on other\r\nprinciples than those known to us.\r\n\r\nTo apply this to the question before us: When by the act of emancipation\r\nthe negro is made a free laborer, he is brought into direct competition\r\nwith the white man; that competition he is unable to endure; and he soon\r\nfinds his place in that lower stratum, which has just been spoken of,\r\nwhere he can support himself in tolerable comfort as a hired servant,\r\nbut cannot support a family. The consequence is inevitable. He will\r\neither never marry, or he will, in the attempt to support a family,\r\nstruggle in vain against the laws of nature, and his children will, many\r\nof them at least, die in infancy. It is not necessary to argue to\r\nconvince a candid man (and for candid men only is this article written)\r\nthat this is, as a general rule, the condition of the free negro. And it\r\nshows, beyond the possibility of mistake, what in this country his\r\ndestiny must be. Like his brother, the Indian of the forest, he must\r\nmelt away and disappear forever from the midst of us. I do not affirm or\r\nintimate that this must be his destiny in all countries. In the tropical\r\nregions of the earth, where he may have little to fear from the\r\ncompetition of the more civilized white man, he may preserve and\r\nmultiply his race. Let him try the experiment. It is worth trying.\r\n\r\nFar be it from me to intimate that the negro is the only class of our\r\npopulation that are in this sad condition. In our large cities and towns\r\nthere are hundreds of thousands of men who have no drop of African blood\r\nin their veins, and who are more clamorous than any other class against\r\nnegro equality, who, through ignorance or vice, or superstition, or\r\ninevitable calamity, are in the same hard lot; their children, if they\r\nhave any, perish in great numbers in infancy, and they will add nothing\r\nto the future population of our country. That will be derived from a\r\nstronger, nobler parentage. Their race will become extinct. Their case\r\ndiffers from that of the colored man only in this, that they are not\r\ndistinguished by color and features from the rest of the population; so\r\nthat the decay of their race cannot be traced by the eye and the memory,\r\nand expressed in statistical tables.\r\n\r\nWe are now prepared to see why the colored population has been, for a\r\nconsiderable time, declining in New York and New England. In those\r\nStates population is dense; all occupations which afford a comfortable\r\nliving for a family are crowded and the competition of the white man is\r\nquite too much for the negro. If emancipation were now to be made\r\nuniversal, the same thing would rapidly occur in all parts of our\r\ncountry. The white laborer would rush in and speedily crowd every avenue\r\nto prosperity and wealth; and the negro, with his inferior civilization,\r\nwould be crowded everywhere into the lower stratum of the social\r\npyramid, and in a few generations be seen no more. The far more rapid\r\nincrease of the white race would render the competition more and more\r\nsevere to him with each successive generation, and render his decay more\r\nrapid, and his extinction more certain.\r\n\r\nI am well aware that this article may fall into the hands of many\r\nexcellent men who will not relish this argument, nor this conclusion.\r\nThey will say it were better then to keep the poor negro in slavery. But\r\nthey would not say so if they would consider the whole case. If slavery\r\nwere a blessing to the black man, it is so great a curse to the white\r\nman that it should never be permitted to exist. The white man can afford\r\nto be kind to the negro in freedom; but he cannot afford to curse\r\nhimself with being his master and owning him as his property. On this\r\npoint I need not enlarge, for I am devoutly thankful that the literature\r\nof Christendom is full of it.\r\n\r\nBut slavery is not a blessing to the negro, even in the view of his\r\ncondition which I have presented; it is an _unmitigated curse_. To a man\r\nof governed passions and virtuous life, it is infinitely better to be an\r\nunmarried freeman, enjoying the comforts of this life, and the hopes of\r\nthe life to come, than to live and die a slave, and the parent of an\r\ninterminable posterity of slaves. To a being of vicious life and\r\nungoverned passions, all life is a curse, whether in slavery or freedom;\r\nand it surely is not obligatory on us, or beneficial to the colored man,\r\nto preserve the system of slavery for the sake of perpetuating a\r\nsuccession of such lives down through coming generations.\r\n\r\nSlavery, by forced and artificial means, propagates society from its\r\nlowest and most degraded class, from a race of barbarians held within\r\nits bosom from generation to generation, without being permitted to\r\nshare its civilizing influences. It thus propagates barbarism from age\r\nto age, till at last it involves both master and slave in a common ruin.\r\nFreedom recruits the ranks of a nation's population from the homes of\r\nthe industrious, the frugal, the strong, the enlightened, the virtuous,\r\nthe religious; and leaves the ignorant, the superstitious, the indolent,\r\nthe improvident, the vicious, without an offspring, and without a name\r\nin future generations. Freedom places society, by obeying the law of\r\npropagation which God imposed on it, upon an ascending plane of\r\never-increasing civilization; slavery, by a forced and unnatural law of\r\npropagation, places it upon a descending plane of ever-deepening vice\r\nand barbarism.\r\n\r\nThat dread of negro equality which is perpetually haunting the\r\nimaginations of the American people, is, therefore, wholly without\r\nfoundation in any reality. It is a delusion, which has already driven\r\nus, in a sort of madness, far on the road to ruin. It is, I fear, a\r\njudicial blindness, which the all-wise and righteous Ruler of the\r\nuniverse has sent upon us for the punishment of our sins. The negro does\r\nnot aspire to political or social equality with the white man. He has\r\nevidently no such destiny, no such hope, no such possibility. He is\r\nweak, and constantly becoming weaker; and nothing can ever make him\r\nstrong but our continued injustice and oppression. He appeals not to our\r\nfears, but to our compassion. He asks not to rule us: he only craves of\r\nus leave to toil; to hew our wood and draw our water, for such miserable\r\npittance of compensation as the competition of free labor will award\r\nhim--_a grave_. If we deny him this humble boon, we may expect no end to\r\nour national convulsions but in dissolution. If we promptly grant it,\r\nover all our national domain, we may expect the speedy return of peace,\r\nand such prosperity as no nation ever before enjoyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAS HE SUCCESSFUL?\r\n\r\n     'Do but grasp into the thick of human life! Every one _lives_\r\n     it--to not many is it _known_; and seize it where you will, it is\r\n     interesting.'--GOETHE.\r\n\r\n     SUCCESSFUL.--Terminating in accomplishing what is wished\r\n     or intended.'--WEBSTER'S _Dictionary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nWe go tack to look a little at the fortunes of the Meeker family.\r\nTwenty-three years have passed since we introduced it to the reader, on\r\nthe occasion of Hiram's birth. Time has produced his usual tokens. Mr.\r\nMeeker is already an old man of seventy, but by no means infirm. His\r\ndays have been cheerful and serene, and his countenance exhibits that\r\ncontented expression which a happy old age produces.\r\n\r\nA happy old age--how few of the few who reach the period enjoy _that_!\r\nMr. Meeker's life has been unselfish and genuine; already he reaps his\r\nreward.\r\n\r\nMrs. Meeker, too, is twenty-three years older than when we first made\r\nher acquaintance. She is now over sixty. She still possesses her fair\r\nproportions; indeed, she has grown somewhat stouter with advancing\r\nyears. Her face is sleek and comely, but the expression has not\r\nimproved. When she wishes to appear amiable, she greets you with the\r\nsame pleasing smile as ever; but if you watch her features as they\r\nrelapse into their natural repose, you will discover a discontented,\r\ndissatisfied air, which has become habitual. Why? Mrs. Meeker has met\r\nwith no reverses or serious disappointments in the daily routine of her\r\nlife. But, alas! its sum total presents no satisfactory consequences.\r\nShe has become, though unconscious of it, weary of the changeless\r\nformality of her religious duties, performed as a ceaseless task,\r\nwithout any real spirit or true devotion. Year after year has run its\r\ncourse and carried her along, through early womanhood into mature life,\r\non to the confines of age. What has she for all those years? Nothing but\r\ndisquiet and solicitude, and a vague anxiety, without apparent cause or\r\nsatisfactory object.\r\n\r\nAs they advance in age, Mr. and Mrs. Meeker exhibit less sympathy in\r\neach other's thoughts and views and feelings. By degrees and\r\ninstinctively the gulf widens between them--until it becomes impassable.\r\nEverything goes on quietly and decorously, but there is no sense of\r\nunited destiny, no pleasurable desire for a union beyond the grave.\r\n\r\nThe children are scattered; the daughters are all married. Jane and\r\nLaura have gone 'West,' and Mary is living in Hartford. Doctor Frank we\r\nwill give an account of presently. George is a practical engineer, and\r\nis employed on the Erie canal. William, who was to remain at home and\r\nmanage the farm, is married, and lives in a small house not far off. His\r\nmother would permit no 'daughter-in-law' with her. She did not like the\r\nmatch. William had fallen in love with a very superior girl,\r\nfine-looking and amiable, but not possessed of a penny. Besides, she\r\nbelonged to the Methodist church, a set who believed in falling from\r\ngrace! Mrs. Meeker had peremptorily forbid her son marrying 'the girl,'\r\nbut after a year's delay, and considerable private conversation with his\r\nfather, William _had_ married her, and a small house which stood on the\r\npremises had been put in order for him. What was worse, William soon\r\njoined the same church with his wife, and then the happiness of the\r\nyoung couple seemed complete. Mrs. Meeker undertook, as she said, to\r\n'make the best of a bad bargain,' so the two families were on terms of\r\nfriendly intercourse, but they continued to remain separated.\r\n\r\nDr. Frank, as he was called, had taken his medical degree, and, by the\r\nindulgence of his father, whose heart yearned sympathetically toward\r\nhis firstborn, opportunity was afforded him to spend a year in Paris.\r\nMrs. Meeker groaned over this unnecessary expense. When she saw that on\r\nthis occasion she was not to have her own way, she insisted that the\r\nmoney her husband was wasting on Frank should be charged against his\r\n'portion.' She never for a moment forgot Hiram's interest. She had\r\nschemed for years so to arrange affairs that the homestead proper would\r\nfall to him, notwithstanding George was to be the farmer. Mrs. Meeker\r\ncalculated on surviving her husband for a long, indefinite period. She\r\nwas several years younger, and, as she was accustomed to remark, came of\r\na long-lived race. 'Mr. Meeker was failing fast' (she had said so for\r\nthe last fifteen years)--'at his age he could not be expected to hold\r\nout long. He ought to make his will, and do justice to Hiram, poor boy.\r\nAll the rest had received more than their share. _He_ was treated like\r\nan outcast.'\r\n\r\nThis was the burden of Mrs. Meeker's thoughts, the latter portion of\r\nwhich found expression in strong and forcible language. For she\r\ncalculated, by the aid of her 'thirds' as widow, to so arrange it as to\r\ngive her favorite the most valuable part of the real estate.\r\n\r\nThere was a fixedness and a tenacity about this woman's regard for her\r\nyoungest child that was, in a certain sense, very touching. It could not\r\nbe termed parental affection--that is blind and indiscriminating; it was\r\nrather a sympathetic feeling toward a younger second self, with which,\r\ndoubtless, was mingled the maternal interest. Whatever touched Hiram\r\naffected her; she understood his plans without his explaining them; she\r\nforesaw his career; she was anxious, hopeful, trembling, rejoicing, as\r\nshe thought of what he must pass through before he emerged rich and\r\npowerful.\r\n\r\nHiram visited home but seldom. Even when at Burnsville, he came over\r\nscarcely once in three months. Often, when expecting him, his mother\r\nwould sit by the window the whole afternoon, watching for her son to\r\narrive. Many a time was supper kept hot for him till late into the\r\nnight, while she sat up alone to greet him; but he did not come. I\r\nhardly know how to record it, but I am forced to say that Hiram cared\r\nvery little about his mother. Could he have possibly cared much for\r\nanybody, he would probably for her, for he knew how her heart was bound\r\nup in him. He knew it, and, I think, rather pitied the old lady for her\r\nweakness. His manner toward her was all that could be desired--very\r\ndutiful, very respectful. So it was to his father. For Hiram did not\r\nforget the statement of his Sunday-school teacher, which was made when\r\nhe was a very young child, about the 'commandment _with promise_.' Thus\r\nhis conduct toward his parents was, like his conduct generally,\r\nunexceptionable.\r\n\r\nFor Frank, the eldest, however, Hiram felt a peculiar aversion. It was a\r\nlong time before the former entertained any other feeling for his\r\n'little brother' than one of the most affectionate regard. By many years\r\nthe youngest of the family, Hiram, while a child, was the pet and\r\nplaything of the older ones, and especially of Frank, who in his college\r\nvacations took pleasure in training the little fellow, who was just\r\nlearning his letters, and in teaching him smart sayings and cunning\r\nexpressions. As Hiram grew up and began to display the characteristics I\r\nhave already so fully described, Frank, who was quick and sensitive in\r\nhis appreciation of qualities, could not, or at least did not, conceal\r\nthe disgust he felt for these exhibitions. He took occasion on his\r\nvisits home to lecture the youngster soundly. Hiram was not\r\ndemonstrative in return, but Mrs. Meeker gave way to undue warmth and\r\nexcitement in taking his part. This was when Hiram was at the village\r\nacademy. From that time, there was coolness between the brothers,\r\nincreased by the total difference of their notions, which ripened in\r\ntime to settled aversion. After Hiram went to Burnsville, they did not\r\nmeet. Dr. Frank, after spending his year abroad, had returned and\r\naccepted the appointment of demonstrator of anatomy in a medical school\r\nin Vermont. Thence he was called to a chair, in what was then the only\r\nmedical college in the city. He was at the time about thirty-six years\r\nold, and a splendid fellow. Enthusiastically devoted to his profession,\r\nDr. Frank had looked to the metropolis as the field of his ultimate\r\nlabors. But he knew the difficulties of getting established, and it was\r\nnot till he was assured of a respectable foothold through his\r\nappointment that he ventured on the change. Doubtless the fact of his\r\nhaving a wife and children made him cautious. Now, however, we behold\r\nhim settled in town, zealously engaged with his class at lecture hours,\r\nand making his way gradually in public favor.\r\n\r\nIt was with some surprise that, one evening, while making a short call\r\nat Mr. Bennett's, he encountered Hiram, who had just removed to the\r\ncity. The brothers had not met for four years. On this occasion they\r\nshook hands with a species of cordiality--at least on the Doctor's\r\npart--while Hiram preserved a bearing of humility and injured innocence.\r\nThe Doctor asked his brother many questions. Was he living in town--how\r\nlong since he had come to New York--was he engaged with Mr.\r\nBennett--what was he doing? Hiram returned short answers to these\r\nqueries--very short--acting the while as if he were in pain under a\r\ncertain infliction. He looked up, as much as to say, 'Now, let me alone;\r\nplease don't persecute me.' But the Doctor did not give the matter up.\r\nHe invited Hiram to come and see him, and told him, with a smile, to be\r\nsure and let him know if he should be taken sick. Hiram wriggled in his\r\nseat, and looked more persecuted than ever; he replied that his health\r\nwas very good, and likely to continue so. The words were scarcely out of\r\nhis mouth, before it struck him that such an observation was a direct\r\ntempting of Providence, to trip his heels and lay him on a sickbed for\r\nhis boast. So, after a slight hesitation, he added, 'But the race is not\r\nto the swift, brother, and I am wrong to indulge in vainglory about\r\nanything. Life and death are uncertain; none realize it, I trust, more\r\ndeeply than I do.'\r\n\r\n'I was in hopes, Hiram, you had quit talking cant,' said Dr. Frank, in a\r\ntone of disgust. 'Take my advice, and stop it, that is, if it is not too\r\nlate.'\r\n\r\nHe did not wait for a response, but, much to Hiram's satisfaction, rose,\r\nand saying to Mrs. Bennett that he had overstayed his time, bade a rapid\r\n'good evening' to all, and left the room.\r\n\r\n'It is dreadful to feel so toward a brother. It is of no use. I won't\r\nattempt to resist it. The least we see of each other the better--but,\r\ngood God, what's to become of him!' Such was the Doctor's soliloquy as\r\nhe walked rapidly on. Other thoughts soon occupied his mind, and Hiram\r\nwas forgotten. The latter, however, did not forget. The Doctor's rebuke\r\nfilled his heart with rage; still he consoled himself with the thought\r\nthat his brother was an infidel, and would unquestionably be damned.\r\nMeantime he was forced to hear various encomiums on him from Mrs.\r\nBennett and her daughters--[Doctor Frank, as we have intimated, was a\r\nbrilliant fellow, and in the very prime of life]--and was still further\r\nannoyed by a remark of Mr. Bennett, that 'the Doctor was doing very\r\nwell; gaining ground fast; getting some of our best families.' Hiram\r\ndeparted from the house in an uncomfortable state of mind. All the way\r\nhome he indulged in the bitterest feelings: so strong were these that\r\nthey found expression in ominous mutterings to himself, among which\r\nwere, 'Conceited fool,' 'I hate him,' and the like.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Hiram's thoughts appeared to take a new direction. He stopped\r\nshort, and exclaimed aloud: 'What have I done? O God, have mercy on me.\r\nGod forgive me!'\r\n\r\nWhen he reached his room he hastily struck a light and seized his Bible.\r\nTurning the leaves rapidly in search of something, his eyes were at\r\nlength fastened on a verse, and he trembled from head to foot, and his\r\nbreath nearly failed him, while he read as follows:\r\n\r\n     _'But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother\r\n     without a cause, shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever\r\n     shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council:\r\n     but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell\r\n     fire.'_\r\n\r\n'The very word; oh, the very, very word!' he exclaimed. 'I have said\r\nit--said that word--said 'fool,' and I am in danger of hell fire, if I\r\ndo belong to the church. Yes, hell fire--oh-oh--oh, hell fire. I wish\r\nmother was here. I know what I will do. I will write a confession, and\r\nsend it to my brother to-morrow. I will abase myself before him. Yes, I\r\nwill. Oh, oh, hell fire! What _will_ become of me!' Hiram prayed, a good\r\nportion of the night, for a remission of the awful sentence; the bare\r\npossibility of its being carried out filled him with terror.\r\n\r\nAt last, overcome by weariness and exhaustion, he fell asleep.\r\n\r\nHe awoke early. He lay several minutes, revolving the last night's\r\nscene. Presently his countenance brightened. He sprang from the bed, and\r\nagain turned to the dreaded text, but not with his previous alarm. On\r\nthe contrary, he was hopeful. He read the verse over carefully, and said\r\nto him self: 'I am all right, after all. It means whosoever shall say\r\nthe word _to_ his brother. I did not make any reply to Frank, much as he\r\nirritated me. I restrained my anger, and suffered humiliation before\r\nhim. I may have been too violent in giving utterance to these\r\nexpressions, but it is doubtful if I have even incurred _any_ penalty,\r\nfor I surely was not angry _without a cause_. God has heard my prayers,\r\nand has relieved my mind in answer thereto. I shan't have to make a\r\nconfession either. Glad of that. How he would have triumphed over me!'\r\n\r\nSo Hiram went forth to his usual 'duties,' his complacency fully\r\nrestored, and his faith confirmed that he was one of the 'elect.'\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n'Already she guessed who it was!'\r\n\r\nAnd who _could_ he be--the intelligent, handsome, but, as it would seem,\r\nover-bold young man, who had presumed to place himself so confidently in\r\nher path and interrupt her walk till he had said his say, and then\r\ndisappear as abruptly as he came?\r\n\r\nShe guessed who.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of her father with the guest he was to bring proved she had\r\ndivined right. For coming up the avenue, she saw that it was the same\r\nhandsome young man she had a little before encountered. And she could\r\nperceive in her father's countenance a glowing look of satisfaction as\r\nthe two mounted the steps (Sarah was peeping through the blinds) and\r\nproceeded to enter the house. Before they had accomplished this,\r\nhowever, the room was vacant. Sarah was nowhere to be found--that is,\r\nfor the moment; but in due time she presented herself, and thereupon Dr.\r\nJames Egerton--that was his name--was formally introduced to her.\r\n\r\n'I recollect you now,' said Sarah, seriously. 'Your features have not at\r\nall changed, except they seem larger and--'\r\n\r\n'Older, doubtless,' interrupted the young man. 'You, too, have changed,\r\neven more than I; but I knew you the moment my eyes fell on you.' * * *\r\n\r\nSeven years had passed since grievous afflictions befell Joel\r\nBurns--when his wife died and his daughter was stricken low, and he\r\nhimself was brought to the very gates of death. The reader has already\r\nbeen made acquainted with these circumstances, and will scarcely forget\r\nthat, when the famous medical man returned to New Haven after visiting\r\nSarah, he despatched his favorite student, with directions to devote\r\nhimself to the case. It is known, too, with what earnestness and skill\r\nthe youth--for he was little more than a youth--performed his\r\nresponsible duties.\r\n\r\nHere I had thought to take leave of him, but as he has abruptly come on\r\nthe stage as a visitor at Burnsville, and as Sarah Burns already\r\nexhibits an incipient interest in the young doctor, I must let the\r\nreader into the secret of his sudden appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNION.\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nRHODE ISLAND AND DELAWARE COMPARED.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1790 the population of Rhode Island was 69,110, and that of Delaware\r\n59,096. In 1860 the former numbered 174,620, the latter 112,216. Thus,\r\nfrom 1790 to 1860, the ratio of increase of population of Rhode Island\r\nwas 152.67 per cent., and of Delaware, 89.88. At the same relative rate\r\nof increase, for the next, as for the last seventy years, the population\r\nof Rhode Island in 1930, would be 441,212, and of Delaware, 213,074.\r\nThus in 1790, Rhode Island numbered but 10,014 more than Delaware,\r\n62,404 more in 1860, and, at the same ratio of increase, 228,138 more in\r\n1930. Such has been and would be the effect of slavery in retarding the\r\nincrease of Delaware, as compared with Rhode Island. (Census Table,\r\n1860, No. 1.)\r\n\r\nThe population of Rhode Island per square mile in 1790, was 52.15, and\r\nin 1860, 133.71; that of Delaware, 27.87 in 1790, and 59.93 in 1860. The\r\nabsolute increase of population of Rhode Island, per square mile, from\r\n1790 to 1860, was 80.79, and from 1850 to 1860, 20.74; that of Delaware,\r\nfrom 1790 to 1860 was 25.05, and from 1850 to 1860, 9.76. (Ib.)\r\n\r\nAREA.-The area of Rhode Island is 1,306 square miles, and of\r\nDelaware, 2,120, being 38 per cent., or much more than one third larger\r\nthan Rhode Island. Retaining their respective ratios of increase, per\r\nsquare mile, from 1790 to 1860, and reversing their areas, the\r\npopulation of Rhode Island in 1860, would have been 283,465, and of\r\nDelaware, 78,268.\r\n\r\nIn natural fertility of soil Delaware is far superior to Rhode Island,\r\nthe seasons much more favorable for crops and stock, and with more than\r\ndouble the number of acres of arable land.\r\n\r\nPROGRESS OF WEALTH.--By Census Tables 33 and 36 (omitting\r\ncommerce), it appears that the products of industry as given, viz., of\r\nagriculture, manufactures, mines, and fisheries, were that year, in\r\nRhode Island, of the value of $52,400,000, or $300 per capita, and in\r\nDelaware, $16,100,000, or $143 per capita. That is, the average annual\r\nvalue of the product of the labor of each person in Rhode Island is\r\ngreatly more than double that of the labor of each person in Delaware,\r\nincluding slaves. This, we have seen, would make the value of the\r\nproducts of labor in Rhode Island in 1930, $132,363,600, and in\r\nDelaware, only $30,469,582, notwithstanding the far greater area and\r\nsuperior natural advantages of Delaware as compared with Rhode Island.\r\n\r\nAs to the rate of increase: the value of the products of Delaware in\r\n1850 was $7,804,992, in 1860, $16,100,000; and in Rhode Island, in 1850,\r\n$24,288,088, and in 1860, $52,400,000 (Table 9, Treas. Rep., 1856),\r\nexhibiting a large difference in the ratio in favor of Rhode Island.\r\n\r\nBy Table 36, p. 196, Census of 1860, the cash value of the farm lands of\r\nRhode Island in 1860 was $19,385,573, or $37.30 per acre (519,698\r\nacres), and of Delaware, $31,426,357, or $31.39 per acre. (1,004,295\r\nacres). Thus, if the farm lands of Delaware were of the cash value of\r\nthose of Rhode Island per acre, it would increase the value of those of\r\nDelaware $5,935,385, whereas the whole value of her slaves is but\r\n$539,400.\r\n\r\nBut by Table 35, Census of 1860, the total value of the real and\r\npersonal property of Rhode Island in 1860, was $135,337,588, and of\r\nDelaware, $46,242,181, making a difference in favor of Rhode Island,\r\n$89,095,407, whereas, we have seen, in the absence of slavery, Delaware\r\nmust have far exceeded Rhode Island in wealth and population.\r\n\r\nThe earnings of commerce are not given by the census, but, to how vast\r\nan extent this would swell the difference in favor of Rhode Island, we\r\nmay learn from the Census, Bank Table No. 34. The number of the banks of\r\nRhode Island in 1860, was 91; capital, $20,865,569; loans, $26,719,877;\r\ncirculation, $3,558,295; deposits, $3,553,104. In Delaware, number of\r\nbanks, 12; capital, $1,640,775; loans, $3,150,215; circulation,\r\n$1,135,772; deposits, $976,223.\r\n\r\nHaving shown how much slavery has retarded the material progress of\r\nDelaware, let us now consider its effect upon her moral and intellectual\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nNEWSPAPERS AND PERIODICALS.--The number of newspapers and\r\nperiodicals in Rhode Island in 1860, was 26, of which 18 were political,\r\n6 literary, and 2 miscellaneous. (Census, Table No. 37.) The number in\r\nDelaware was 14, of which 13 were political, and 1 literary. Of\r\nperiodicals, Delaware had none; Rhode Island, 1. The number of copies of\r\nnewspapers and periodicals issued in Rhode Island in 1860 was 5,289,280,\r\nand in Delaware only 1,010,776, or largely more than five to one in\r\nfavor of Rhode Island.\r\n\r\nAs regards schools, colleges, academies, libraries, and churches, I must\r\ntake the census of 1850, those tables for 1860 not being yet arranged or\r\npublished. The number of public schools in Rhode Island in 1850 was 426,\r\nteachers 518, pupils 23,130; attending school during the year, as\r\nreturned by families, whites, 28,359; native adults of the State who\r\ncannot read or write, 1,248; public libraries, 96; volumes, 104,342;\r\nvalue of churches, $1,293,600; percentage of native free adults who\r\ncannot read or write, 149. Colleges and academies, pupils, 3,664. (Comp.\r\nCensus of 1850.) The number of public schools in Delaware in 1850, was\r\n194, teachers 214, pupils 8,970; attending school during the year,\r\nwhites, as returned by families, 14,216; native free adults of the State\r\nwho cannot read or write, 9,777; public libraries, 17; volumes, 17,950;\r\nvalue of churches, $340,345; percentage of native free adults who cannot\r\nread or write, 23.03; colleges and academies, pupils, 764. (Comp.\r\nCensus, 1850.)\r\n\r\nThese official statistics enable me then again to say, that slavery is\r\nhostile to the progress of _population_, _wealth_, and _education_, to\r\n_science_ and _literature_, to _schools_ and _colleges_, to _books_ and\r\n_libraries_, to _churches_ and _religion_, to the _press_, and therefore\r\nto FREE GOVERNMENT; hostile to the _poor_, keeping them in _want_ and\r\n_ignorance_; hostile to _labor_, reducing it to _servitude_, and\r\ndecreasing _two thirds_ the value of its products; hostile to MORALS,\r\nrepudiating among slaves the _marital_ and _parental_ condition,\r\nclassifying them by law as CHATTELS, darkening the immortal soul, and\r\nmaking it a _crime_ to teach millions of human beings to _read_ or\r\n_write_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAUSES AND RESULTS OF THE WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are certain theories in regard to the causes of the present war,\r\nwhich are so generally accepted as to have fortified themselves strongly\r\nin the principle of '_magna est veritas_ et prevalebit.' Theories based,\r\nhowever, upon facts which have taken their rise long since the true\r\ncauses of the war had begun to work, and which, consequently, mistaking\r\nthe effect for the cause, are from their nature ephemeral, and farther\r\nfrom the truth than they were at their origin. Few thinkers have looked\r\nbelow the surface of the matter, and the majority of Christendom,\r\nignoring any other past than the few brief years that have rolled over\r\nour national existence, forgetting that great causes oft-times smoulder\r\nunseen for centuries ere they burst forth in effects the more powerful\r\nfrom their long suppression, shaking the earth with the pent-up fury of\r\nages--forgetting these things and arguing in the present instance from\r\nthe few palpable facts found floating upon the surface of our society,\r\nby a tacit consent lay the burden of the war upon the present generation\r\nand its immediate predecessors. Herein lies the error which blinds the\r\nworld as well to the warning of the past as to the momentous issue\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\nWhere then shall we look for the cause of that antagonism in which North\r\nand South are arrayed--that bitter hostility setting brother against\r\nbrother, and father against child, dividing into two separate portions a\r\nnation descended from the same stock, whose archives are one, all whose\r\nassociations of a glorious past are the same, and which has hitherto\r\nswept swiftly on to unparalleled wealth and power, seemingly\r\nindissolubly united, and looking forward to the same glorious and\r\never-expanding future? Not to the errors in our political system, for no\r\nfaults of government could, in a brief century, have produced such an\r\nupheaving of the foundations of society as we now behold--could have\r\nawakened such a thunder peal as is now causing the uttermost corners of\r\nthe earth to tremble with dismay. Not to the institution of slavery, for\r\nhowever great a curse it maybe to our people and soil, however\r\nbrutalizing in its tendencies, however unjust to the negro race, and\r\nopposed to all the principles of enlightenment and human progress--of\r\nwhatever crimes it may have been guilty, this last and greatest of\r\ncrimes cannot be laid at its door: for the bitterness of feeling between\r\nNorth and South existed long before the agitation of slavery was dreamed\r\nof, and the latter has only been seized upon as the ready means of\r\naccomplishing a greater design. Finally, not to any supposed desire in\r\nthe Southern mind of establishing an independent empire of the South,\r\nwhose people should be homogeneous, whose individual interests\r\nidentical, and whose climate, productions, and institutions should move\r\non in undisturbed harmony forever. For to this last a motive is wanting.\r\nUnder no government that the world has ever known could the South have\r\nenjoyed so much freedom, such unexampled prosperity, such a rapid growth\r\nin wealth and power, in a word, so much real happiness--which is the sum\r\nof all earthly gifts--as under this which they are so earnestly\r\nendeavoring to tear down and blot from the face of the earth. Men's\r\nminds do not eagerly grasp and sternly pursue an abstract idea divorced\r\nfrom every consideration of self-interest, such as this would be. Even\r\nthe greatest of moral principles are indebted to self-interest for their\r\nsuccess, and without it the sublimest of creeds, the loftiest of\r\nprinciples would soon wither and die for lack of support. With every\r\nblessing that heart could wish in the present, and with no hope through\r\nchange of bettering their condition in a practical point of view in the\r\nfuture, the idea of a great Southern empire, based upon such uncertain\r\npossibilities, would soon have disappeared from the Southern mind, even\r\nif it had ever existed.\r\n\r\nNay; the true cause is beneath and behind all these, taking its rise\r\nfrom the very foundations of English society in the dark ages, from the\r\nestablishment of classes and distinctions of rank. In English history\r\nthis principle reached its culmination in the wars of the Parliament,\r\nthat great political tempest which changed the whole destiny and guided\r\nthe future of that powerful nation, making it, as it is to-day, the\r\ndominant race of the old world. Its greatest development, however, was\r\nreserved for our day and our land. The England of the subsequent era was\r\na new government, a new people. She reaped her harvest of good from her\r\ngigantic struggles, and so must we reap our harvest from ours. From the\r\nmoment when the first settlers set foot upon our shores our inevitable\r\ndestiny was foreshadowed; the seeds of the 'Great Rebellion' were even\r\nthen deeply implanted, and all causes have since that day worked\r\ntogether for its fulfilment. We too must be purified by fire and sword;\r\nand may we not hope that our beloved country may emerge from the\r\nslaughter, the ruin, and the conflagration, more prosperous, more\r\npowerful than ever before, and casting off the slough of impurity that\r\nhas for long years been hardening upon her, renovated and redeemed by\r\nthe struggle, sweep majestically on to a purer and nobler destiny than\r\neven our past has given promise of, and attain a loftier position than\r\nany nation on earth has yet acquired?\r\n\r\nThe intimate relation of the feudal ages, between baron and retainer,\r\nestablished at first upon principles of individual safety and the public\r\nweal, soon degenerated into that of noble and serf. That which at first\r\nwas but an honorable distinction between knight service on the one hand,\r\nand protection and patronage on the other, became, in the course of\r\ntime, the baser relation of haughty assumption and oppression on the one\r\nhand, and the most abject servitude on the other. Descended from the\r\nsame stern Saxon stock, separated only by purely artificial barriers, by\r\nthe fortuitous circumstance of birth, the sturdy peasant could ill brook\r\nthe tyranny of the privileged class--those 'lords rich in some dozen\r\npaltry villages.' That stern independence which has ever been the\r\nprominent characteristic of the Saxon mind, revolted at the palpable\r\ninjustice of the relation of lord and serf. The aristocracy, on the\r\ncontrary, fortified in their arrogance, at a later day, by the irruption\r\nof the Norman nobility, with their French ideas and customs, so far from\r\nyielding to the signs of the times and the light of dawning\r\ncivilization, refused to give up one tittle of their assumed\r\nprerogatives, and became even more exacting in their demands, more lofty\r\nin their supposed superiority. Thus was engendered between the two\r\nclasses a bitterness of feeling, a spirit of antagonism, that has never\r\nyet disappeared. Patiently did the peasant bide his time, and only when\r\nthe tyranny became utterly unendurable did the movement commence which\r\nhas swept downward to our time, reiving away one by one the miscalled\r\nprivileges of the favored class, bringing, year by year, the condition\r\nof the laborer nearer to the true balance of society.\r\n\r\nThis antagonism reached its height in the Cromwellian era, and the men\r\nof those times stand forth upon the page of history as the exponents of\r\nthe great principles of civil freedom. The strength of the Cromwellian\r\nparty lay in the fact that it was composed almost entirely of the\r\nlaboring and the middle classes, the bone and sinew of the land. Then\r\nfor the first time in English history the world saw the plebeian pitted\r\nagainst the aristocrat, and the strife which ensued involved not so much\r\nthe question of kingly prerogative and the 'divine right' of monarchs,\r\nas the pent-up feuds of ages--feuds arising from the most flagrant\r\ninjustice and wrong on the one hand and forced submission on the other.\r\nThis of itself was enough to lend to the contest a character of ferocity\r\nwhich well might make civilization turn pale. But even this bitterness\r\nwas slight compared with that engendered by the _religious_ element of\r\nthe war. The history of the world has shown no wars so cruel and bloody,\r\nno crimes so heinous, no hatred so deep seated and abiding as those\r\nproduced by religious differences. Strange that it should be so! Strange\r\nthat the sacred cause whose province is to develop the purest and\r\nholiest emotions of the soul, should call forth and develop the\r\nfiercest, the darkest, and most unrelenting passions of the human heart!\r\nYet so it proved in this instance. Their fierce, fanatical enthusiasm\r\nwas a powerful element of strength to the Roundheads, which was lacking\r\nto the effeminate, corrupt, and godless Cavaliers. With such an\r\nauxiliary the struggle could not be doubtful; religious fanaticism\r\ncarried the day.\r\n\r\nIn the years succeeding the Restoration, the evil effects of this\r\nreligious antagonism were modified by mutual concessions, and in time\r\nalmost disappeared under the impartial administration of a government\r\nfounded upon a firmer basis than ever before, and more consonant to\r\nSaxon ideas of justice and social equality. But with us of America there\r\nwas no such modification, for from the midst of this time of war and\r\ntumult, of savage hatred and unrelenting persecution, American society\r\nsprang. Our country was settled by representatives of these two extremes\r\nof English society, and in their choice of abode the hand of Providence\r\nis distinctly seen laying the foundations of our struggle of to-day,\r\nwhich is to prove the refining fire, the purification and regeneration\r\nof our race. Had the Cavaliers landed upon the shores of New England,\r\nthe bracing winds of that northern clime, the rugged and intractable\r\nnature of the soil, the constant presence of dangers from the fiercer\r\nIndian tribes of the north, and the absolute necessity of severe and\r\nincessant toil to support existence, would have awakened and developed\r\nin them those manly qualities which for centuries had lain dormant in\r\ntheir souls--would have imparted new strength to their frames, new vigor\r\nand energy to their modes of thought; their indolence and effeminacy\r\nwould soon have passed away, and they would have constantly approached,\r\ninstead of departing from the true Puritan type. While, on the other\r\nhand, the stern, rough, almost savage peculiarities of the Puritan would\r\nin like manner have been modified by the genial influences of a southern\r\nsun and a teeming soil, and while the severe training and rough\r\nexperiences of centuries, as well as their peculiar mental constitution,\r\nwould have prevented their entirely lapsing into the indolence and\r\neffeminacy of the Cavalier, the whole race would nevertheless have\r\nundergone a softening change, bringing them in their turn nearer the\r\ntype of their old antagonists; and thus each succeeding year would have\r\nseen these two extremes of social life drawing nearer and nearer\r\ntogether, and at last blending in dull, contented, plodding harmony. And\r\nthe result would doubtless have been the degeneration of the entire\r\nrace, and our fate that of the Spanish American colonies.\r\n\r\nBut this did not suit the designs of Providence. It was His purpose that\r\nthere should be here those manifold social and political conflicts which\r\nare the life of a great nation--which are, indeed, the motive power to\r\nthe wheels of human progress. A great problem in human destiny was here\r\nto be wrought out; a powerful nation was to arise, bearing within itself\r\nthe elements of its own continual purification. The Cavalier landed\r\nupon the shores of Virginia, and spread his settlements southward. The\r\ninfluence of climate upon both the physical and mental constitution of\r\nman is well known. The enervating climate of the 'sunny South,' the soil\r\nfruitful beyond a parallel, pouring forth its products almost\r\nspontaneously, and, above all, the 'peculiar institution,' which\r\nreleased the planter from the necessity of toil, all tended to aggravate\r\nthe peculiarities of mind and body which the settlers inherited from\r\ntheir ancestors; and the result has been a race which, while it presents\r\nhere and there an example of brilliant, meteoric genius, is, in the\r\nmain, both intellectually and physically inferior to the hardy denizens\r\nof the North and West. The same influences have fostered the\r\naristocratic notions of the early settlers of the Southern States. With\r\nevery element of a monarchy in their midst, the Gulf States have long\r\nbeen anything but a republic. De Bow, when, a few years since, he\r\nbroached in his Review the idea, and prophesied the establishment of a\r\nmonarch in our midst, was but giving expression to a feeling which had\r\nlong been dominant in the Southern heart. All their institutions,\r\nassociations, and reminiscences have tended steadily to this result, and\r\nin the event of the success of the rebellion, it needs but some bold\r\napostle to take upon himself the propagation and execution of the plan,\r\nto make the idea a startling reality. And herein lies the secret of the\r\nsympathy of the English aristocracy with the confederates in their\r\nstruggle for independent existence.\r\n\r\nThe Puritan, guided by the hand of God, planted his future abode on the\r\nshores of New England, a land truly congenial to him, whose whole mental\r\nand physical life had hitherto been one of storm and tempest. Nor could\r\na fitter type in the human race have been found than he to tame the\r\nrock-crowned hills, to brave the rigors of such winters as Old England\r\nnever knew, and the lurking dangers at the hands of a powerful and\r\njealous race. Here was no place for indolence and luxurious ease. Only\r\nby the most persevering and painful labors could the bleak hills and\r\ngorge-like valleys be made to yield the fruits of life. Only by\r\nunremitting energy and the most patient self-denial could starvation be\r\nkept from his door, while constant watchfulness and never-flinching\r\ncourage were required to ward off the many dangers that beset his path.\r\nNature herself seemed pitted against him to contest every inch of his\r\nprogress. But his nature was as stern and rough as that of the land he\r\nhad come to tame. Accustomed to move steadily on in the pursuit of some\r\none great purpose, to surmount every obstacle and crush every\r\nimpediment, looking neither to the right nor the left, nor even pausing\r\nto pluck the flowrets that bloomed by the wayside, there was for him no\r\nsuch word as fail. Here the unbounded resources and exhaustless energy\r\nof body and mind found fitting scope. What to ordinary men would seem\r\nbut hopeless, cheerless toil, was to him but pastime. The Puritan was\r\njust the man for New England, and New England the land for the Puritan.\r\nHow he succeeded let all Christendom proclaim, for his works were not\r\nfor himself nor his immediate posterity, but for the whole world.\r\n\r\nBut it is not so much with the results of his labors that we have to do\r\nas with their effects upon himself and his posterity. Here, as in the\r\ncase of the Cavalier, every circumstance of his life tended to aggravate\r\nthe hereditary peculiarities of his class. The success of his\r\nenterprise, the crowning of those hopes which had led him to cast off\r\nall ties of the old world, the lofty spirit which induced him to reject\r\nall external aid, and, above all, the crisp, free mountain air he\r\nbreathed, begot in him a feeling of independence and superiority, and,\r\nat the same time, ideas of social equality, which have made themselves\r\nmanifest to all time. Where all were toilful laborers, and few possessed\r\nmore than a sufficiency of worldly goods to provide for the necessities\r\nof the day, there was no room for the distinctions of rank. Power, with\r\nthem, resided in the masses; the results of their labor were common\r\nstock; their interests were one and the same. Add to these facts their\r\nancient hatred of the aristocracy, and we have the influences Under\r\nwhich New England has ever tended to republicanism. The Puritan race has\r\never been republican to the core, and this is one great and vital\r\nrespect in which they have continually diverged from their Southern\r\nbrethren.\r\n\r\nYet with, all their virtues, with all their sublime heroism, was blended\r\nan inordinate, morbid selfishness. Shut in within their little republic\r\nfrom all Communion with the outer world, lacking the healthful\r\ninfluences of conflicting ideas and that moral attrition which polishes\r\nthe cosmopolitan man, enlarging his views of life and giving broader\r\nscope as well to the active energies of the soul as to the kinder\r\nsympathies and benevolent sensibilities of the heart, this little\r\ncommunity became more set in their traditional opinions, and gradually\r\nimbibed a hearty contempt for all beyond the pale of their own religious\r\nbelief, which soon extended to all without the bounds which\r\ncircumscribed their narrow settlements. Living alike, thinking alike,\r\nfeeling alike, placing under solemn ban all speculations in religion,\r\nand even all research into the deeper mysteries of natural science,\r\ngrinding with iron heel the very germ of intellectual progress, in their\r\nblind presumption they would have closed the doors of heaven itself upon\r\nall mankind save the called and elected of the Puritan faith. This\r\nintellectual life was one of mere abstractions, and as a natural\r\nconsequence all their thoughts and emotions, their joys and sorrows,\r\ntheir loves and hatreds, became morbid to the last degree. But the bent\r\nbow will seek release; the reaction came at last, and the astonishing\r\nmental progress of the New England of to-day, the wild speculation upon\r\nall questions of morals and religion, rivalling in their daring scope\r\nthe most impious theories of the German metaphysicians, which our New\r\nEngland fosters and sustains, and above all, the proverbial trickery of\r\nthe Yankee race, are but the reaction of the stern and gloomy tenets of\r\nthat olden time which would have made of our earth a charnel house\r\ncrowded with mouldering bones.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this intensely morbid Puritan life, no more eligible\r\nobject could have been presented for the exercise of their bitterest\r\nantipathies than the descendants of their ancient enemies, the\r\nCavaliers,--who were already rivalling them in the South, and who, as we\r\nhave shown, were equally ready to cast or lift the gauntlet. Occupying\r\nthe very extremes of religious faith, radically differing in their views\r\nof public polity, of bitterly hostile antecedents and traditions, the\r\none looking upon the other as an outcast from salvation itself, and the\r\nother in its turn nothing loth brands its opponent with the epithets of\r\nsurly, hypocritical, psalm-singing knaves, then as now, and as they have\r\never been since the foundations of our country were laid, these two\r\nclasses stood arrayed against each other in every respect save that of\r\nopen, carnal warfare. The bitterest of foes in the beginning,\r\ndiametrically opposed in every possible respect, each has plodded on in\r\nhis own narrow path, and the two paths have continually diverged to our\r\nday, and the present outbreak is but as the breaking of a sore which has\r\nlong been ripe. It is of such antagonisms that nations are made: it is\r\nbut differences such as these that have separated the common stock of\r\nAdam into so many distinct races and nationalities through all the ages\r\nof the world. Such a result we see to-day in our country, in two\r\nseparate and distinct nations, hitherto nominally united under one form\r\nof government--nations as distinct as ever were the Roman and the Greek.\r\nAs the Cavalier of the Cromwellian era was a horror to the pharisaical\r\nPuritan, and the Puritan in his turn a contempt and an abomination to\r\nthe reckless, pleasure-hunting Cavalier, so to-day is the\r\n'psalm-singing, clock-peddling Yankee' a foul odor to the fastidious\r\nnostrils of the lordly Southerner, and the reckless prodigal, dissipated\r\nand soul-selling planter a thorn in the flesh of Puritan morality. The\r\nYankee is to the Southerner a synonym for all that is low and base and\r\ncunning, and the Southerner is to the Yankee the embodiment of all\r\nworthlessness and crime. The same spirit is observable in those Northern\r\nStates which were settled by a mixed emigration from both portions of\r\nthe country, and the fact is well known that even in those loyal Western\r\nStates where the Southern element most predominates, is found the\r\nbitterest hatred and denunciation of the Yankee; so that he is no sage\r\nwho draws the line east and west, north and south, and in every mixed\r\ncommunity, between the descendant of the Cavalier, and the man of\r\nPuritan stock. Shall any one say that this is but the result of the war?\r\nWhere then does history record a like instance? Where can be found the\r\nrecord of a civil war where the people, descended from a common stock\r\nand bound together by a common interest, sprang with such alacrity to\r\nthe call to arms, and waged a war so relentless and cruel even in its\r\nvery commencement, except there had been radical antagonisms existing\r\nthrough a long series of years?\r\n\r\nBut it may be urged that a large portion of the Southern population are\r\nemigrants from the New England States, and consequently of Puritan\r\ndescent, and that while this very class of slaveholders are notoriously\r\nthe most cruel and exacting of masters, they stand in the front ranks of\r\nsecession and are the most deadly enemies of the North. True, but the\r\nenmity of this class, wherever it exists, is that of the most sordid,\r\nunprincipled self-interest. Gold is their god, and all things else are\r\nsacrificed to the unhallowed lust. But this enmity is oftentimes assumed\r\nfrom motives of self-preservation. Objects of suspicion to the\r\nSimon-Pure Southerner from the very fact of their nativity, and visited\r\nwith the most horrible retribution wherever they have shown a leaning\r\ntoward the land of their birth, they find it necessary to out-herod\r\nHerod in order to preserve their social status and the possessions which\r\nare their earthly all. Hence, to disarm suspicion, often those have been\r\nmade to take the more prominent positions in this tragic drama who, did\r\ncircumstances permit the expression of their true sentiments, would be\r\nfound to be at heart the most truly loyal citizens of the South. Another\r\nclass--and this includes more particularly the descendants of Northern\r\nemigrants--born and bred among the moral influences of Southern society,\r\nimbibing all the ideas and prejudices of their surroundings, lose their\r\nidentity as effectually as the raindrop is lost in the surging billows\r\nof the ocean. Drinking in with their years the prevailing hatred of the\r\nvery stock from which their own descent is derived, they become part and\r\nparcel of the people among whom their lot is cast, and ordinarily run to\r\nthe farthest extreme of the new nationality. Herein is seen the fallacy\r\nof the ancient maxim--_Coelum, non animum mutant qui trans mare\r\ncurrant_. The all-potent influence of self-interest, the overshadowing\r\nsway of undisputed dogmas, soon sweep away the lessons and prejudices of\r\nearlier years, and effectually transform the foreign born into the\r\ncitizen of the new clime and nation. Were the population of the South\r\nmore equally divided between the Northern and Southern born, this would\r\nnot be the case; but in all the slave-holding States the Cavalier\r\nelement so overwhelmingly predominates as to crush before it all\r\nopposing ideas, prejudices, and opinions.\r\n\r\nThis radical antagonism, smouldering for years, found its first great\r\nexpression in the Tariff question of 1832, which was not so much a\r\nquestion of State rights and agricultural interests as the vehicle, or\r\nrather the weapon of the pent-up hatred of years. General Jackson saw\r\nthe true bearing and origin of the dispute; and when he prophesied that\r\nthe slavery question would be the next issue sprung by the designing\r\nrevolutionists of the South, he did but show his appreciation of the\r\ngreat fact of the moral and physical antagonism between the descendants\r\nof the Cavalier and the Puritan. He might, and probably would, had\r\ncircumstances required it, have gone farther, and prophesied, that\r\nshould the slavery question in its turn be settled, some other cause of\r\ndispute would soon be found and grasped by the apostles of separation\r\nand revolution, as a means for the accomplishment of their great design.\r\nHe alone, of all our statesmen, with his far-seeing eye saw and\r\nappreciated the tremendous issue involved. He was sternly opposed to the\r\ncompromise which was subsequently made, well knowing that if the\r\nquestion were not then settled, at once and forever, the flame was but\r\nsmothered for a time, to break out again in future years, with far\r\ngreater vehemence. His policy was to crush the malcontents by the strong\r\narm of power, to make such a display of the strength and resources of\r\nthe Federal Government, such an example of the fate which must ever\r\nawait treason in our midst, and, above all, such a convincing\r\nmanifestation of the utter hopelessness of all attempts to destroy a\r\ngreat and good government, deriving its powers and functions from the\r\npeople themselves, as to put forever at rest the machinations of\r\ntraitors and anarchists. Experience has shown that he was right, and\r\nshown us, too, that if, in this our day, a second compromise be adopted,\r\nand a peace patched up upon a basis ignoring the true cause of dispute,\r\nor of oblivion to the past, or, worst of all, of yielding, on our part,\r\none jot or tittle to the demands of our antagonists, as sure as there is\r\na God in heaven--as sure as that retribution follows the sinner, the war\r\nwill have to be fought over again, more savage, more bloody, and more\r\ndesolating than ever, by our posterity, if not even in our own time.\r\nFought over again, not once, but again and again, as often as the\r\nrevolving wheel of human progress and enlightenment shall bring to the\r\nsurface the black waters of the steaming cesspool below.\r\n\r\nBut what of the result? Watchman! what of the night? The night is stormy\r\nand dark; men's hearts are failing them for fear; those who see clearly\r\nin the day time, now grope helplessly in the dark; the blind are leading\r\nthe blind; society is at a stand still, waiting and watching for the\r\ncoming day. Yet afar off in the east the patriot's eye may even now see\r\nthe first faint streaks of that light which shall usher in the golden\r\ndawn.\r\n\r\nThe result, in the event of the success of the North, is too palpable to\r\nrequire a moment's thought, involving, as it does, every possible\r\nblessing to our race, every advantage to the progress of the new\r\ntheories of social equality, and of man's capacity for self-government.\r\nBut what in the other event? The evils would be legion--countless in\r\nnumber and direful in effect, not to us alone, but to the whole American\r\nrace. First and foremost is that hydra _precedent_. We are fighting, not\r\nalone for the stability of any particular form of government, not alone\r\nfor the sustaining of an administration, not alone for the upholding of\r\nthose God-given ideas which have made America the most favored land on\r\nearth; but against a PRECEDENT, which involves and would destroy them\r\nall. Precedent which is, and ever has been, all powerful to overturn\r\ntheories and systems, to topple kings from their thrones, and plunge\r\nnations into slavery. Of all dangers which every liberal form of\r\ngovernment has to shun, none is so deadly as this. Grave and venerable\r\njudges, sages though they may be, rest upon it, and thereon base\r\ndecisions involving millions of property, and sometimes life itself. And\r\nthough, as Blackstone has declared, a bad precedent in law is\r\ncomparatively harmless, inasmuch as succeeding judges are in no wise\r\nbound by it, but free, and in fact bound to decide the law as it was\r\nbefore the evil precedent was established, and to interpret it as it\r\nought to be, yet in national affairs this is not so. No matter how bad\r\nor absurd a precedent may be, designing men will be found in all ages\r\nand climes to avail themselves of it, honestly or dishonestly. Men's\r\nminds are not constructed alike, and that which seems evil to one is to\r\nanother good. The foulest of all theories, the basest of systems, the\r\nmost suicidal of policies, will at all times find sincerely honest\r\nadherents and supporters. Individuality of mind admits a million of\r\nshades and degrees of right and wrong. Moreover, an idea once broached\r\nbefore the people, no matter how detestable it may at first appear, is\r\nalready halfway advanced upon the road to execution. Thousands of\r\ncriminals have been executed for crimes their minds would never have\r\nconceived save for the suggestion of some artful apostle of evil. Give\r\nme but a precedent once firmly established, I care not how bad it may\r\nbe, and I shall revolutionize the world.\r\n\r\nAnd what is the precedent against which we have to contend? It is that\r\nof separation. If secession would stop where it has begun, if the result\r\nof our defeat were to be but two great republics of the North and South\r\nupon our continent, there would still be room for the development of\r\nboth, and we might even look forward to such a peace with some degree of\r\ncomplacency, and with hope for a future of happiness and prosperity. But\r\nit will not stop here. As surely as that an overruling Providence\r\ndirects the affairs of men, the movement will go on until there are as\r\nmany separate and hostile republics as there are States in our Union.\r\nThe mutterings of separation--which have already been heard in the West,\r\nare but the precursors of the storm which can only be forever allayed by\r\nthe triumph of our arms in the present contest. The slightest\r\ndisagreement between the East and the West would soon be made a pretext\r\nfor secession: the least dispute or conflicting interest between any two\r\ngreat portions of our country would find a speedy remedy in separation.\r\nThe West would divide from the East, the Atlantic States from the Lake\r\nStates, the Mississippi States from the Pacific, the North Pacific\r\nStates from the South Pacific, and where would be the end? Already the\r\ngreat West has learned her own gigantic strength, which before she knew\r\nnot that she possessed, and if the time should come when her interests\r\nshould apparently point in a different direction from those of the East,\r\nwith such a precedent before her, would she not avail herself of that\r\nnew-found strength? Already the soldiers of the West have begun to sneer\r\nat the achievements of those of the East, and to consider themselves the\r\nbraver and the manlier of the two. Are these not the signs of the times?\r\nAnd do they not betoken a future of anarchy in the event of the\r\nestablishment of this most pernicious and monstrous of doctrines?\r\n\r\nAnd is it to be expected that these many republics, monarchies,\r\naristocracies, or whatever form they may take, will long remain at peace\r\nwith each other? Ask the muse who presides over the pages of history how\r\noften has her pen been called upon to record the circumstance of\r\nseparate nations, of the same blood and antecedents, lying quietly and\r\npeaceably beside each other. Family quarrels are proverbially the most\r\nbitter of all on earth, and family hatreds the most unrelenting. It was\r\nbut the ties of kin that lent such a character of ferocity to our wars\r\nwith England and to the present contest with the South.\r\n\r\nBut what shall we say of that scheme which aims at a reconstruction of\r\nthe Union by leaving New England out? Simply this: that, aside from any\r\nconsiderations of policy--without attempting to argue the question of a\r\ngood or evil result from such a movement, the answer is plain enough:\r\n_you cannot do it_--and that which is impossible needs no argument for\r\nor against. The energy and activity of mind and body, the lofty\r\nindependence, the firm self-reliance, the dogged determination and\r\nundaunted adherence to a great and high purpose, of the whole Saxon\r\nrace, is concentrated in the people of that mountain land. Theirs have\r\nbeen the heads to plan and the hands to execute every great work we have\r\naccomplished since the foundation of our nationality. The railroads and\r\ncanals and telegraphs of the North, the South, the East, and the West\r\nare their work; and their capital and their inventive, energetic minds\r\nstill shape and control every great commercial enterprise of our land.\r\nTheir sturdy emigrants have pushed civilization across the boundless\r\nprairies of the West, and opened the primeval forests of the Pacific\r\nStates. Go where you will on the face of the earth, and you find them\r\nthere before you, and ever the same busy, tireless apostles of progress,\r\nthe leaders in every great work, and the rulers of commerce, everywhere\r\nlooked up to as the type of the executive mind, and, by the tacit\r\nconsent of Christendom, intrusted with the guidance of every enterprise\r\nrequiring pluck, perseverance, and ceaseless activity. And theirs will\r\nstill be the brains to control the destinies of our race, however\r\nisolated they may become, however they may be made the objects of\r\ndistrust and contempt. Ay! shut them out if you will, and from that\r\nmoment New England becomes the Switzerland of America, the home of great\r\nideas and great men, the temple where Freedom shall take up her\r\neverlasting abode, and the altar fires of Liberty shall never die away.\r\nAnd her people will become the priests of that great religion which,\r\ntaking its rise in a lofty appreciation of the true end of human\r\nexistence, is already bursting out all over the Christian world, in\r\nfitful flames, which shall yet become the devouring element that shall\r\nwither and consume away oppression and kingcraft from the face of the\r\nearth. Shut her out, then, if you will, but you cannot shut out the\r\nflame which she shall kindle; you cannot shut out the tones of her\r\ntrumpet voice, proclaiming to the world the doctrines of eternal truth.\r\nSelf-reliant, possessing within themselves every element of success, her\r\npeople can and will make their way, as heretofore, alone and unaided.\r\nAsking no favors of the world, they will pursue the even tenor of their\r\nway, undisturbed by the mutterings and growlings of their impotent foes,\r\nwhile their little republic, like a city set upon a hill, continues to\r\nreflect from her glittering pinnacles the sunlight of heaven to all\r\nquarters of the earth. The petty vengeance which the disunionists of\r\nto-day are attempting to wreak upon her will recoil upon their own\r\nheads, and they themselves may yet be forced some day to look to little\r\nNew England as their redeemer from anarchy. A purely commercial people,\r\nher interests are not circumscribed by her narrow geographical limits,\r\nbut are, as well as her tastes and sympathies, cosmopolitan. She\r\nstretches out her feelers to all parts of the earth, wherever her\r\nwandering sons may have betaken themselves, and fastens there a little\r\nvine or creeper whose roots are still in her own bosom. It is a part and\r\na necessity of her very existence, to handle and direct catholic\r\ninterests. This, as well as her position in other respects, has made her\r\nthe arbiter of this nation and country, and you can no more shut her out\r\nfrom participation in the affairs of this continent than you can shut in\r\nthe mighty river from its outlet to the ocean. And if you cut her off,\r\nsee to it that she does not become the little Rome whose conquering arms\r\nshall reduce all the nations of the continent to her sway.\r\n\r\nNo! New England has planted herself too deeply in the hearts of the\r\nAmerican people--she has sprinkled too many of her scions among the\r\npopulation of the West and South--to allow of a moment's serious thought\r\nof cutting her off from our communion. The cry is but the party cry of\r\nthe designing and evil disposed, the traitors to our name and nation;\r\nand with the crushing out of the rebellion and the restoration of our\r\nnationality; it will pass away forever.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the direct results of the war. Having shown the\r\nthreatened evils of separation, our province leads us no farther, for\r\nthis comprises _all_ the evils within the scope of man's imagination.\r\nSee, then, the issue involved: in our success lie all our hopes of\r\nfuture stability and prosperity; in our failure lies simply--inevitable\r\nruin. With such a prospect before them--with existence itself hanging in\r\nthe balance--why are the people of the North asleep? Why will they not\r\nsee the true bearings of the war in this light, and arise in all their\r\npower and strength, determined to crush out this infamous rebellion,\r\neven at the cost of the last dollar and the last drop of blood! Shall we\r\ngrumble at the cost of the war? Shall we growl over the paltry taxes\r\nwhich, even yet, are scarcely felt? Shall the father grieve for the loss\r\nof half his wealth which goes to redeem his only son from death--his\r\n'darling from the power of the lions'? Shall the house-holder grumble\r\nover the reward he has offered for the rescue of his wife and little\r\nones from the burning house? Shall the felon begrudge the last cent of\r\nhis earthly possessions that purchases his relief from the gallows?\r\nBetter that we should all be ruined--better that the land should be\r\nentirely depleted of its youth, and the country irretrievably in debt,\r\nwith a prospect of a future and lasting peace, than a compromise now,\r\nwith the inevitable certainty of everlasting war and tumult and\r\nbloodshed, worse, a thousand times worse than that of the South American\r\nStates. Shall we make a peace now, only that we may again go to war\r\namong ourselves? Would this not be literally 'jumping out of the frying\r\npan into the fire'? The _war_ men of the North are the men of peace, and\r\nthe so-called peace men are the men of eternal war; those are they who\r\nwould prolong the miseries of our country, simply by turning them in a\r\nnew direction--by turning all our hostilities into our own bosoms and\r\nagainst out own wives and children. Nay I there can be no pausing now.\r\nWe have everything to gain by prosecuting the war to the bitter, even\r\nruinous end; everything to lose by leaving the work half done. The South\r\nis said to be fighting for its very existence; yet not by a thousand\r\ndegrees can this be as truly said of them as of us. Therefore should our\r\nearnestness, our enthusiasm, our determination, our _desperation_ be a\r\nthousand times greater than theirs. Do you tell me that we cannot\r\nconquer so united, so brave, and so desperate a people? I answer, WE\r\nMUST. In the whole wide world of human destiny there is no other road\r\nleft open for us; the path to defeat is blocked by our own dead bodies.\r\nUnless the people of the North arouse and take hold of the work with an\r\nenergy, an earnestness of purpose, to which the past bears no parallel,\r\ntoo late will they repent the folly of their own supineness, their own\r\nblindness. As in the affairs of men, so in those of nations, there is a\r\ncritical point when those who hope for success must seize the winged\r\nmoment as it flies and work steadily on with singleness of aim and\r\nunchangeable, unfaltering devotion of purpose. That moment, once past,\r\nwill never return. Now is our golden opportunity, and according as we\r\nimprove or neglect it will our future be one of greatness and power or\r\none of utter nothingness among the nations of the earth. No subsequent\r\ntime can repair the errors or failures of to-day.\r\n\r\nSince the greater part of this article was written, the prospect of our\r\nsuccess has immeasurably brightened. But let us not by the fairness of\r\nthe sky be lulled into a false sense of security; let us not be again\r\ndeceived by the _ignis fatuus_ glare which plays around our banners, and\r\nwhich has already so often lured us to forgetfulness and defeat. For the\r\nstorm may again break forth in a moment when we think not of it, and\r\nfrom a quarter where we seemed the most secure. A single week may\r\nreverse every move upon the great chess board of strategy. There should\r\nbe no relaxation of the sinews of war until the end is accomplished. So\r\nshould we be safest in our watchfulness and strength, and, by the\r\nirresistible influence of overwhelming numbers and might, render that\r\npermanent which is now but evanescent.\r\n\r\nBut, it will be asked, if there is between North and South an antipathy\r\nso deep seated and of such long standing, how shall we ever succeed in\r\nconquering a lasting peace? how shall we ever persuade the people of the\r\nSouth to live in amity with a race so cordially hated and despised? The\r\nquestion has often been asked, but always by those faint-hearted ones\r\nwhose clamors for a disgraceful peace have added strength to the cause\r\nof our opponents. The answer is so plain that it requires no\r\ndemonstration. There is but one remedy for so sore a disease, and\r\nhowever severe it may be, however revolting to the tender sensibilities\r\nof peace-loving men, the inevitable and inexorable MUST urges\r\nit on to execution, and stands like a giant, blocking up every other\r\npath. It is like those dangerous remedies which the physician applies\r\nwhen the patient's recovery is otherwise utterly hopeless, and which\r\nmust result either in recovery or in death by its own agency rather than\r\nthat of the disease. Concession has been tried in vain, 'moral suasion'\r\nhas been proved to be of no avail. The South must be shown how entirely\r\nhopeless must be every effort, in all time, to overturn such a\r\ngovernment as ours. They must be made to feel our immense superiority in\r\npower and resources; they must be shown in unmistakable colors the\r\nunconquerable might of nationality in strong contrast with the weakness\r\nof sectionalism, as well as their own dependence upon the North; in a\r\nword, every atom of resistance must be utterly and forever crushed out\r\nby brute force. To no other argument will they listen, as experience has\r\nproved; and this 'last resort of kings' must be exerted in all its\r\nstrength and proclaimed in thunder tones, even though its reverberations\r\nshould shake the earth to its very core. This done, and peace once more\r\nestablished, the South must be, _not_ abolitionized, not colonized, not\r\nPuritanized, nor yet oppressed, but AMERICANIZED. They must be\r\nfamiliarized with those immortal principles of justice and freedom, to\r\nwhich they have hitherto been strangers, which lie at the heart of all\r\nnational success among an enlightened and Christian people. They must be\r\nmade acquainted with the all-important fact that we are a nation of one\r\nblood, one common ancestry; that we can never live at peace as separate\r\nnationalities, and that only in unity and mutual concession and\r\nforbearance can a glorious destiny be wrought out for our common\r\ncountry. _Then_, not now, will be the time for conciliation on our part,\r\nbut yet conciliation never divided from the utmost vigilance and a firm\r\nsupport of the doctrine of national supremacy, as opposed to, and\r\nparamount to the iniquitous dogma of State rights. The people of the\r\nNorth must first divest themselves of all prejudices, all hereditary\r\nantipathies, and wipe away old scores in the dawn of a golden future.\r\nThen will our brethren of the South not be slow to respond to the\r\nproffered peace and good will and brotherly kindness, and again we\r\nshall become a prosperous, united, and happy people.\r\n\r\nAnd what a future lies before our country! What a wealth of uncultivated\r\nfields lies waiting for the plough of the adventurous emigrant! What\r\nunmeasured wilds wait but for the touch of enlightened and educated\r\nlabor, to blossom like the rose, to become the site of great cities and\r\nsmiling villages, the resting place of the wanderer from all quarters of\r\nthe globe, the residence of a great people, the component parts of a\r\nmighty nation whose parallel earth has not seen since the days of the\r\ncreation! It needs but ordinary human foresight to see that here is to\r\nbe the fountain head, the permanent abiding place, of four great\r\ninterests, with which we shall rule the world: manufactures, grain,\r\ncotton, and wine. The Great West is to feed all Europe with her harvests\r\nof yellow grain; the South, with her cotton interest, is to clothe, not\r\nEurope only, but the world; the Pacific States will be the 'vineland' of\r\nAmerica, furnishing the wherewithal to 'gladden the heart of man,' while\r\nthe manufactures of New England and the Middle States shall furnish the\r\nimplements of labor to the brethren all over the continent, and turn the\r\nraw material both of the South and of their own sheep-feeding hills into\r\ngarments for the toiling millions of America. Here, then, we shall\r\nproduce, as no other country can, the great staples of life; and when we\r\nadd to them those considerable minor interests which we share more\r\nequally with the rest of the world, namely, wool-growing and _mining_,\r\nas well of the precious ores as of coal and the baser metals, how\r\nstupendous seem our resources, how tremendous the influence we are to\r\nwield among the great human family! And is it a necessity of social life\r\nthat these great interests should jar? that political and commercial\r\nantagonisms should spring up between these cumulators of the world's\r\ngreat stock of wealth, for no better reason than that their hands are\r\nengaged upon a different work, or, rather, upon different branches of\r\nthe same great work of production? Nay, verily! So long as we are bound\r\ntogether by a common tie of country, living and working under the same\r\nlaws and institutions, such antagonisms can only exist in the trains of\r\ndesigning demagogues. So far from conflicting, these great interests\r\nwill, from the very nature of the law of exchange, work harmoniously\r\ntogether, blending the one into the other as perfectly fitting parts of\r\none concordant whole. One section will play into the hands of another,\r\nsustaining each other from the very necessity of self-preservation; and\r\neach will find in his brother the readiest consumer of the products of\r\nhis labor. Only in the event of separation can jealousies, antipathies,\r\nand narrow-minded prejudices spring up between the different sections,\r\nand healthy competition be degraded into low and mercenary jobbing; only\r\nby separation can the onward march of the American race be retarded and\r\nthe arm of American industry paralyzed. Accursed, then, be the hand that\r\naims a blow at the foundations of our fair fabric of Liberty; thrice\r\naccursed he whose voice is raised in the promulgation of those\r\npernicious doctrines whose end is to lead a great people astray.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREAT HEART.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Great Heart is sitting beneath a tree:\r\n  Never a horse upon earth has he;\r\n  But he sings to the wind a hearty song,\r\n  Leaves of the oak trees rustling along:\r\n  'Over the mountain and over the tide,\r\n  Over the valley and on let us ride!'\r\n\r\n  There's many a messenger riding past,\r\n  And many a skipper whose ship sails fast;\r\n  But none of them all, though he rides or rows,\r\n  Flies as free as the heart of Great Heart goes,\r\n  Free as the eagle and full as the tide:\r\n  'And over the valley and on let us ride!'\r\n\r\n  Many a sorrow might Great Heart know,\r\n  Thick as the oak leaves which over him grow\r\n  Many a trouble might Great Heart feel,\r\n  Close as the grass blades under his heel;\r\n  But sorrow will never by Great Heart bide,\r\n  Singing 'Over the valley and on let us ride!'\r\n\r\n  'But tell me, good fellow, where Great Heart dwells?'\r\n  In the wood, by the sea, in the city's cells;\r\n  Where the Honest, the Beautiful, and True\r\n  Are free to him as they are to you;\r\n  Where the wild birds whistle and waters glide,\r\n  Singing 'Over the valley and on let us ride!'\r\n\r\n  Few of his fellows doth Great Heart see;\r\n  Seldom he knows where their homes may be;\r\n  But the fays of the greenwood are still on earth--\r\n  To many a Great Heart they'll yet give birth;\r\n  And thousands of voices will sing in pride,\r\n  'All over the wide world and on let us ride!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERARY NOTICES\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF CHOPIN. By F. LISZT. Published by F. Leypoldt:\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\nLiszt's Life of Chopin! What a combination of names to wing the\r\nimagination upward into the ethereal regions of beauty, pure art, and\r\nlofty emotion! The imperial pianist discourses upon the genius and\r\npeculiar gifts of his brother musician. Before us arises a vision of the\r\nstrong and fiery Hungarian, with clanger of steel, flash of spur, and\r\nring of hoof, compelling his audiences to attention and enthusiastic\r\nadmiration; and also of the gentle-mannered and suffering, but no less\r\nfiery Pole, shrinking from all rude contact, and weaving enchanted\r\nmelodies and harmonies, teeming with ever-varying pictures of tender\r\nlove, hopeless despair, chivalric daring, religious resignation,\r\npassionate pleading, eloquent disdain, the ardor of battle with the\r\nthunder of artillery, the hut of the peasant with its pastoral\r\npleasures, and the assemblage of the noble, the distinguished, the\r\nbeautiful, with the nameless fascinations of feminine loveliness, the\r\nwitching caprices of conscious power,--while through all and above all\r\nglows the memory of the glorious past and mournful present of his\r\nbeloved country. The book, in fact, opens a vista into modes of life,\r\nmanners of being, and trains of thought little known among us, and hence\r\nis most deeply interesting. The style is eminently suited to the\r\nsubject, and the translation of Liszt's French is equal to the original.\r\nThis is saying much, but not too much; for when a cognate mind becomes\r\nthoroughly imbued with the spirit of an author, the transmutation of his\r\nideas into another form of speech becomes a simple and natural process.\r\nTo those who already know Chopin and are striving to play his music,\r\nthis book will be invaluable, as giving a deep insight into the meaning\r\nand proper mode of rendering his compositions. To those who know nothing\r\nof him, and who are still floundering amid the _fade_ and flimsy\r\nproductions that would fain hide their emptiness and vulgarity under the\r\nnoble name of music, this life of a true musician will reveal a new\r\nworld, a new purpose for the drudgery of daily practice, and the\r\nexpenditure of time, patience, and money.\r\n\r\nThe work, however, is not alone useful for those especially interested\r\nin music, but, being free from all repulsive technicalities, will be\r\nfound highly attractive to the general reader. It contains a subtle\r\ndissection of a deeply interesting character, sketches of Heine, George\r\nSand, Eugene de la Croix, Mickiewicz, and other celebrities in the world\r\nof literature and art, together with a most vivid portraiture of social\r\nlife in Poland, a land which has ever excited so much admiration for its\r\nheroism, and compassion for its misfortunes.\r\n\r\nMr. Leypoldt, the enterprising publisher of this work, merits the\r\nencouragement of the American people, inasmuch as he has not feared to\r\nrisk the publication of a work deemed by many too excellent to be\r\ngenerally appreciated by our reading community. He however has faith in\r\nthe good sense of that community, and so have we.\r\n\r\nFragmentary portions of Liszt's 'Chopin,' about 60 pages out of 202,\r\nwere translated by Mr. Dwight of Boston, and appeared in the 'Journal of\r\nMusic.' Those portions were favorably received, and all who thus formed\r\na partial acquaintance with the work will doubtless desire now to\r\ncomplete their knowledge, especially as some of the most vivid and\r\ncharacteristic chapters were omitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DIARY NORTH AND SOUTH. By WILLIAM HOWARD RUSSELL.\r\nT. O. H. P. Burnham. New York: O. S. Felt, 36 Walker Street. 1863.\r\n(Cloth, one dollar; paper covers, fifty cents.)\r\n\r\nIt is amusing to read over, at this stage of the war, these letters, in\r\nwhich the Thunderer, as represented by Mr. Russell, dwindled down to a\r\nvery small squib indeed. Few men ever prophesied more brazenly as to the\r\nwar,--very few ever had their prophecies so pitiably falsified. Other\r\nmen have guessed right now and then, by chance; but poor Russell\r\ncontrived, by dint of conceit and natural obtuseness, to make himself as\r\nthoroughly ridiculous to those who should review him in the future as\r\nwas well possible. It is, however, to be hoped that these letters will\r\nbe extensively read, that the public may now see who and _what_ the\r\ncorrespondent really was, through whom England was to be specially\r\ninstructed as to the merits of this country and its war. When we\r\nremember the advantages which poor Russell enjoyed for acquiring\r\ninformation, his neglect of matters of importance seems amazing--until\r\nwe find, in scores of petty personal matters and silly egotisms, a key\r\nto the whole. He is a small-souled man, utterly incapable of mastering\r\nthe great principles involved in this war,--a man petrified in English\r\nconceit, and at the end of his art when, like a twopenny reporter, he\r\nhas made a smart little sneer at something or somebody. He writes on\r\nAmerica as Sala wrote on Russia, in the same petty, frivolous vein, with\r\nthe same cockney smartness; but fails to be funny, whereas Sala\r\nfrequently succeeds. He came here to write for England, not the truth,\r\nbut something which his readers _expected_. His object was to supply a\r\ndemand, and he did it. He learned nothing, and returned as ignorant, so\r\nfar as really _understanding_ the problems he purposed to study, as he\r\ncame. Those who can penetrate the depths of such pitiful characters\r\ncannot fail to feel true sorrow that men should exist to whom all life,\r\nall duty, every opportunity to tell great truths and to do good, should\r\nsimply appear as opportunities to turn out a _pièce de manufacture_, and\r\nearn salaries. Mr. Russell could have done a great work in these\r\nletters--he leaves the impression on our minds that in _his_ opinion his\r\nboots and his breakfast were to him matters of much more importance than\r\nthe future of all North America.\r\n\r\n\r\nWANDERINGS OF A BEAUTY: A Tale of the Real and Ideal. By\r\nMRS. EDWIN JAMES. New York: Carleton. 1863.\r\n\r\nAn entertaining little romance, which will be specially acceptable to\r\nthe 'regular English novel' devourers--a by no means inconsiderable\r\nproportion of the public. Its heroine--a beauty--moves in English\r\nsociety, is presented to the Queen, is victimized by a rascally husband\r\nor two, and visits America, where she ends her adventures--_à la Marble\r\nFaun_--rather more obscurely than we could have wished, by 'enduring and\r\nsuffering,' but on the whole happily, so far as sentiment is concerned.\r\nAs the story contains to perfection every element of the most popular\r\nEnglish novels of the day, yet in a more highly concentrated form than\r\nthey usually present, we have no doubt that its sale will be very great.\r\nThe volume contains a very beautifully engraved portrait-vignette,\r\n'after a miniature by Thorburn,' which is worth the price of the book,\r\nand is neatly bound. Gentlemen wishing to make an acceptable gift to\r\nnovel-reading friends will find the 'Wanderings of a Beauty' well suited\r\nto the purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRISONER OF STATE. By D. H. MAHONEY. New York:\r\nCarleton. 1863.\r\n\r\nWe may well ask 'what sustains the hopes of the rebels?' when such a\r\nmass of treason as this wretched volume contains is suffered to be\r\nfreely published and circulated. That the Administration can find the\r\nforce to oppose open foes in the field, and yet make no exertion to\r\nsuppress traitors at home who are doing far more than any armed rebels\r\nto reduce our country to ruin, is a paradox for whose solution we have\r\nfor some time waited, _not_ by any means in patience.\r\n\r\nThat a Copperhead, who from his own account richly deserves the halter,\r\nshould have the impudence to publish a complaint of being simply\r\n_imprisoned_, is indeed amusing. But could the mass of vindictiveness,\r\nsophistry, and vulgarity which these pages contain be simply submitted\r\nto impartial and intelligent men, we should have little dread of any\r\ngreat harm resulting from them. Unfortunately this Copperhead poison,\r\nwith its subtle falsehoods and detestable special pleading, its habeas\r\ncorpus side-issues and Golden-Circle slanders, is industriously\r\ncirculated among many who are still frightened by the old bugbear of\r\n'Abolition,' and who, like the majority in all wars whatever, have\r\naccustomed themselves to grumble at those who conduct hostilities. Such\r\npersons do not reflect that a great crisis requires great measures, and\r\nthat in a war involving such a tremendous issue as the preservation of\r\nthe Federal Union and the development of the grandest phase which human\r\nprogress has ever assumed, we are not to give up everything to our foes\r\nbecause Mr. Mahoney and a few congenial traitors have, justly or\r\nunjustly, been kept on crackers and tough beef. When a city burns and it\r\nis necessary to blow up houses with gunpowder, it is no time to be\r\ntalking of actions for trespass.\r\n\r\nIf we had ever had a doubt of the rightfulness of the course which\r\nGovernment has taken in imprisoning Copperheads, it would have been\r\nremoved on reading this miserable book. A man who holds on one page that\r\nevery private soldier is to be guided by his own will as regards obeying\r\norders, and on another sneers at our army as demoralized,--who calls\r\nhimself a friend of the Union, and is yet a sympathizer with the enemies\r\nof the Union,--who abuses in the vilest manner our Government and its\r\nofficers in a crisis like the present, is one who, according to all\r\nprecedents of justice, should be richly punished under military law, if\r\nthe civil arm be too weak to grasp him. It was such Democrats as\r\nMahoney, who yelled out indignantly in the beginning at every measure\r\nwhich was taken to protect us against the enemy, who, when they had\r\nnearly ruined our cause by their efforts, attributed the results of\r\ntheir treason to the Administration, and who now, changing their cry,\r\ninstead of clamoring for more vigor against the rebels, boldly hurrah\r\nfor the rebellion itself. It is strange that they cannot see that they\r\nare now bringing themselves out distinctly as tories, and men to be\r\nbranded in history. Do they suppose that such a revolution as this--a\r\nrevolution of human rights and free labor against the last great form of\r\ntyranny--is going _backward_? Do the events of the last thirty years\r\nindicate that Southern aristocracy and Copperhead ignorance and evil are\r\nto achieve a final victory over republicanism? Yet it is in this faith,\r\nthat demagoguism will be stronger than a great principle, that such men\r\nas Mahoney write and live.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD SCENES IN SOUTH AMERICA; or, Life in the Llanos of\r\nVenezuela. By DON RAMON PAEZ. New York: Charles Scribner, 124\r\nGrand Street.\r\n\r\nThe work before us takes the reader not only through all the adventures\r\nand chances of the desperate life of the llaneros or herdsmen of South\r\nAmerica, but also gives many startling scenes from the revolutions of\r\nColombia, embracing an excellent biography of the truly great general\r\nPaez, the friend and colleague of Bolivar. But when we remember that it\r\ncontains such a mass of valuable historical material, from the pen of a\r\nson of General Paez, aide-de-camp to his father, and an eyewitness of,\r\nor actor in, some of the bloody scenes of a civil war, and that even the\r\ndescription of herdsman's life is filled with deeply interesting\r\nscientific records of the natural history and botany of our southern\r\ncontinent, it seems strange that such a volume could appear under a\r\ntitle smacking of the veriest book-making for the cheap Western market.\r\n\r\nThe writer, Don Ramon Paez, who was born among the people whom he\r\ndescribes, and was afterward well educated in England, was probably the\r\nbest qualified man in South America to depict the life of the llaneros,\r\nof whom his father was long the literal chief. Half of his pages are\r\noccupied with the account of a grand cattle-hunt, involving sufferings\r\nand adventures of a very varied and remarkable description, giving the\r\nworld, we believe, the best account of wild herdsman American-Spanish\r\nlife ever written. A very curious study of the character of the writer\r\nhimself is one of the many interesting traits of this volume. A love of\r\nliterature, of science, of much that is beautiful and refined, contrasts\r\npiquantly with occasional glimpses of true Creole character, and of a\r\nson of 'the best horseman in South America,' who is too much at home\r\namong the fierce people whom he describes to fully assume the tone of a\r\nforeigner and amateur. In this latter respect Don Ramon seems to have\r\nbeen influenced by regarding as models the works of European travellers,\r\nas well as by a very commendable spirit of modesty; for modest he\r\ncertainly is when speaking of himself, when we consider the temptations\r\nto self-glorification which his adventures would have presented to any\r\nof the English adventurers of the present day!\r\n\r\nThe book cannot fail to be extensively read, since it is not only\r\nentertaining, but instructive. Its sketches of the _causes_ of the\r\ncontinual civil wars in South America are not only explanatory, but may\r\nserve as a lesson to us in this country to give ourselves heart and soul\r\nto the Union, and to crush out treason and faction by every means in our\r\npower. If the rebels and Copperheads triumph, we shall soon see the\r\nUnited States reduced to the frightful anarchy of South America.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONTINENTAL MONTHLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe readers of the CONTINENTAL are aware of the important\r\nposition is has assumed, of the influence which it exerts, and of the\r\nbrilliant array of political and literary talent of the highest order\r\nwhich supports it. No publication of the kind has, in this country, so\r\nsuccessfully combined the energy and freedom of the daily newspaper with\r\nthe higher literary tone of the first-class monthly; and it is very\r\ncertain that no magazine has given wider range to its contributors, or\r\npreserved itself so completely from the narrow influences of party or of\r\nfaction. In times like the present, such a journal is either a power in\r\nthe land or it is nothing. That the CONTINENTAL is not the\r\nlatter is abundantly evidenced _by what it has done_--by the reflection\r\nof its counsels in many important public events, and in the character\r\nand power of those who are its staunchest supporters.\r\n\r\nThough but little more than a year has elapsed since the CONTINENTAL was\r\nfirst established, it has during that time acquired a strength and a\r\npolitical significance elevating it to a position far above that\r\npreviously occupied by any publication of the kind in America. In proof\r\nof which assertion we call attention to the following facts:\r\n\r\n1. Of its POLITICAL articles republished in pamphlet form, a\r\nsingle one has had, thus far, a circulation of _one hundred and six\r\nthousand_ copies.\r\n\r\n2. From its LITERARY department, a single serial novel, \"Among\r\nthe Pines,\" has, within a very few months, sold nearly _thirty-five\r\nthousand_ copies. Two other series of its literary articles have also\r\nbeen republished in book form, while the first portion of a third is\r\nalready in press.\r\n\r\nNo more conclusive facts need be alleged to prove the excellence of the\r\ncontributions to the CONTINENTAL, or their _extraordinary\r\npopularity_; and its conductors are determined that it shall not fall\r\nbehind. Preserving all \"the boldness, vigor, and ability\" which a\r\nthousand journals have attributed to it, it will greatly enlarge its\r\ncircle of action, and discuss, fearlessly and frankly, every principle\r\ninvolved in the great questions of the day. The first minds of the\r\ncountry, embracing the men most familiar with its diplomacy and most\r\ndistinguished for ability, are among its contributors; and it is no mere\r\n\"flattering promise of a prospectus\" to say that this \"magazine for the\r\ntimes\" will employ the first intellect in America, under auspices which\r\nno publication ever enjoyed before in this country.\r\n\r\nWhile the CONTINENTAL will express decided opinions on the\r\ngreat questions of the day, it will not be a mere political journal:\r\nmuch the larger portion of its columns will be enlivened, as heretofore,\r\nby tales, poetry, and humor. In a word, the CONTINENTAL will be\r\nfound, under its new staff of Editors, occupying a position and\r\npresenting attractions never before found in a magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\nTERMS TO CLUBS.\r\n\r\n  Two copies for one year,       Five dollars.\r\n  Three copies for one year,     Six dollars.\r\n  Six copies for one year,       Eleven dollars.\r\n  Eleven copies for one year,    Twenty dollars.\r\n  Twenty copies for one year,    Thirty-six dollars.\r\n\r\nPAID IN ADVANCE.\r\n\r\n_Postage, Thirty-six cents a year_, TO BE PAID BY THE SUBSCRIBER.\r\n\r\n\r\nSINGLE COPIES.\r\n\r\nThree dollars a year, IN ADVANCE. _Postage paid by the Publisher._\r\n\r\nJOHN F.

No State in the Valley of the\r\nMississippi offers so great an inducement to the settler as the State of\r\nIllinois. There is no part of the world where all the conditions of\r\nclimate and soil so admirably combine to produce those two great\r\nstaples, CORN and WHEAT.\r\n\r\n\r\n~CLIMATE.~\r\n\r\nNowhere can the industrious farmer secure such immediate results from\r\nhis labor as on those deep, rich, loamy soils, cultivated with so much\r\nease. The climate from the extreme southern part of the State to the\r\nTerre Haute, Alton and St. Louis Railroad, a distance of nearly 200\r\nmiles, is well adapted to Winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n~WHEAT, CORN, COTTON, TOBACCO.~\r\n\r\nPeaches, Pears, Tomatoes, and every variety or fruit and vegetables is\r\ngrown in great abundance, from which Chicago and other Northern markets\r\nare furnished from four to six weeks earlier than their immediate\r\nvicinity. Between the Terre Haute, Alton & St. Louis Railway and the\r\nKankakee and Illinois Rivers, (a distance of 115 miles on the Branch,\r\nand 136 miles on the Main Trunk,) lies the great Corn and Stock raising\r\nportion of the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n~THE ORDINARY YIELD~\r\n\r\nof Corn is from 50 to 80 bushels per acre. Cattle, Horses, Mules, Sheep\r\nand Hogs are raised here at a small cost, and yield large profits. It is\r\nbelieved that no section of country presents greater inducements for\r\nDairy Farming than the Prairies of Illinois, a branch of farming to\r\nwhich but little attention has been paid, and which must yield sure\r\nprofitable results. Between the Kankakeee and Illinois Rivers, and\r\nChicago and Dunleith, (a distance of 56 miles on the Branch and 147\r\nmiles by the Main Trunk,) Timothy Hay, Spring Wheat, Corn, &c., are\r\nproduced in great abundance.\r\n\r\n\r\n~AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS.~\r\n\r\nThe Agricultural products of Illinois are greater than those of any\r\nother State. The Wheat crop of 1861 was estimated at 85,000,000 bushels,\r\nwhile the Corn crop yields not less than 140,000,000 bushels besides the\r\ncrop of Oats, Barley, Rye, Buckwheat, Potatoes, Sweet Potatoes,\r\nPumpkins, Squashes, Flax, Hemp, Peas, Clover, Cabbage, Beets, Tobacco,\r\nSorgheim, Grapes, Peaches, Apples, &c., which go to swell the vast\r\naggregate of production in this fertile region. Over Four Million tons\r\nof produce were sent out the State of Illinois during the past year.\r\n\r\n\r\n~STOCK RAISING.~\r\n\r\nIn Central and Southern Illinois uncommon advantages are presented for\r\nthe extension of Stock raising. All kinds of Cattle, Horses, Mules,\r\nSheep, Hogs, &c., of the best breeds, yield handsome profits; large\r\nfortunes have already been made, and the field is open for others to\r\nenter with the fairest prospects of like results. DAIRY FARMING also\r\npresents its inducements to many.\r\n\r\n\r\n~CULTIVATION OF COTTON.~\r\n\r\n_The experiments in Cotton culture are of very great promise. Commencing\r\nin latitude 39 deg. 30 min. (see Mattoon on the Branch, and Assumption\r\non the Main Line), the Company owns thousands of acres well adapted to\r\nthe perfection of this fibre. A settler having a family of young\r\nchildren, can turn their youthful labor to a most profitable account in\r\nthe growth and perfection of this plant._\r\n\r\n\r\n~THE ILLINOIS CENTRAL RAILROAD~\r\n\r\nTraverses the whole length of the State, from the banks of the\r\nMississippi and lake Michigan to the Ohio. As its name imports, the\r\nRailroad runs through the centre of the State, and on either side of the\r\nroad along its whole length lie the lands offered for sale.\r\n\r\n\r\n~CITIES, TOWNS, MARKETS, DEPOTS,~\r\n\r\nThere are Ninety-eight Depots on the Company's Railway, giving about one\r\nevery seven miles. Cities, Towns and Villages are situated at convenient\r\ndistances throughout the whole route, where every desirable commodity\r\nmay be found as readily as in the oldest cities of the Union, and where\r\nbuyers are to be met for all kinds of farm produce.\r\n\r\n\r\n~EDUCATION.~\r\n\r\nMechanics and working-men will find the free school system encouraged by\r\nthe State, and endowed with a large revenue for the support of the\r\nschools. Children can live in sight of the school, the college, the\r\nchurch, and grow up with the prosperity of the leading State in the\r\nGreat Western Empire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n~PRICES AND TERMS OF PAYMENT--ON LONG CREDIT.~\r\n\r\n80 acres at $10 per acre, with interest at 8 per ct. annually on the\r\nfollowing terms:\r\n\r\n  Cash payment . . . . . . . $ 48.00\r\n  Payment in one year  . . .   48.00\r\n     \"    in two years . . .   48.00\r\n     \"    in three years . .   48.00\r\n     \"    in four years  . .  236.00\r\n     \"    in five years  . .  224.00\r\n     \"    in six years . . .  212.00\r\n     \"    in seven years . .  209.00\r\n\r\n  40 acres, at $10.00 per acre:\r\n\r\n  Cash payment . . . . . . . $ 24.00\r\n  Payment in one year  . . .   24.00\r\n     \"    in two years . . .   24.00\r\n     \"    in three years . .   24.00\r\n     \"    in four years  . .  118.00\r\n     \"    in five years  . .  112.00\r\n     \"    in six years . . .  106.00\r\n     \"    in seven years . .  100.00\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNumber 18.             25 Cents.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONTINENTAL MONTHLY.\r\n\r\nDEVOTED TO\r\n\r\nLiterature and National Policy.\r\n\r\nJUNE, 1863.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK: JOHN F.
