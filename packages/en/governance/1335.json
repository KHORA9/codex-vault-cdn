It was therefore impossible for me in these\r\nLectures, to say much which had to be said, in drawing a just and\r\ncomplete picture of the Ancien Regime in France.  The passages inserted\r\nbetween brackets, which bear on religious matters, were accordingly not\r\nspoken at the Royal Institution.\r\n\r\nBut more.  It was impossible for me in these Lectures, to bring forward\r\nas fully as I could have wished, the contrast between the continental\r\nnations and England, whether now, or during the eighteenth century.  But\r\nthat contrast cannot be too carefully studied at the present moment.  In\r\nproportion as it is seen and understood, will the fear of revolution (if\r\nsuch exists) die out among the wealthier classes; and the wish for it (if\r\nsuch exists) among the poorer; and a large extension of the suffrage will\r\nbe looked on as--what it actually is--a safe and harmless concession to\r\nthe wishes--and, as I hold, to the just rights--of large portion of the\r\nBritish nation.\r\n\r\nThere exists in Britain now, as far as I can see, no one of those evils\r\nwhich brought about the French Revolution.  There is no widespread\r\nmisery, and therefore no widespread discontent, among the classes who\r\nlive by hand-labour.  The legislation of the last generation has been\r\nsteadily in favour of the poor, as against the rich; and it is even more\r\ntrue now than it was in 1789, that--as Arthur Young told the French mob\r\nwhich stopped his carriage--the rich pay many taxes (over and above the\r\npoor-rates, a direct tax on the capitalist in favour of the labourer)\r\nmore than are paid by the poor.  \"In England\" (says M. de Tocqueville of\r\neven the eighteenth century) \"the poor man enjoyed the privilege of\r\nexemption from taxation; in France, the rich.\"  Equality before the law\r\nis as well-nigh complete as it can be, where some are rich and others\r\npoor; and the only privileged class, it sometimes seems to me, is the\r\npauper, who has neither the responsibility of self-government, nor the\r\ntoil of self-support.\r\n\r\nA minority of malcontents, some justly, some unjustly, angry with the\r\npresent state of things, will always exist in this world.  But a majority\r\nof malcontents we shall never have, as long as the workmen are allowed to\r\nkeep untouched and unthreatened their rights of free speech, free public\r\nmeeting, free combination for all purposes which do not provoke a breach\r\nof the peace.  There may be (and probably are) to be found in London and\r\nthe large towns, some of those revolutionary propagandists who have\r\nterrified and tormented continental statesmen since the year 1815.  But\r\nthey are far fewer in number than in 1848; far fewer still (I believe)\r\nthan in 1831; and their habits, notions, temper, whole mental\r\norganisation, is so utterly alien to that of the average Englishman, that\r\nit is only the sense of wrong which can make him take counsel with them,\r\nor make common cause with them.  Meanwhile, every man who is admitted to\r\na vote, is one more person withdrawn from the temptation to disloyalty,\r\nand enlisted in maintaining the powers that be--when they are in the\r\nwrong, as well as when they are in the right.  For every Englishman is by\r\nhis nature conservative; slow to form an opinion; cautious in putting it\r\ninto effect; patient under evils which seem irremediable; persevering in\r\nabolishing such as seem remediable; and then only too ready to acquiesce\r\nin the earliest practical result; to \"rest and be thankful.\"  His faults,\r\nas well as his virtues, make him anti-revolutionary.  He is generally too\r\ndull to take in a great idea; and if he does take it in, often too\r\nselfish to apply it to any interest save his own.  But now and then, when\r\nthe sense of actual injury forces upon him a great idea, like that of\r\nFree-trade or of Parliamentary Reform, he is indomitable, however slow\r\nand patient, in translating his thought into fact: and they will not be\r\nwise statesmen who resist his dogged determination.  If at this moment he\r\ndemands an extension of the suffrage eagerly and even violently, the wise\r\nstatesman will give at once, gracefully and generously, what the\r\nEnglishman will certainly obtain one day, if he has set his mind upon it.\r\nIf, on the other hand, he asks for it calmly, then the wise statesman\r\n(instead of mistaking English reticence for apathy) will listen to his\r\nwishes all the more readily; seeing in the moderation of the demand, the\r\nbest possible guarantee for moderation in the use of the thing demanded.\r\n\r\nAnd, be it always remembered, that in introducing these men into the\r\n\"balance of the Constitution,\" we introduce no unknown quantity.\r\nStatesmen ought to know them, if they know themselves; to judge what the\r\nworking man would do by what they do themselves.  He who imputes virtues\r\nto his own class imputes them also to the labouring class.  He who\r\nimputes vices to the labouring class, imputes them to his own class.  For\r\nboth are not only of the same flesh and blood, but, what is infinitely\r\nmore important, of the same spirit; of the same race; in innumerable\r\ncases, of the same ancestors.  For centuries past the most able of these\r\nmen have been working upwards into the middle class, and through it,\r\noften, to the highest dignities, and the highest family connections; and\r\nthe whole nation knows how they have comported themselves therein.  And,\r\nby a reverse process (of which the physiognomist and genealogist can give\r\nabundant proof), the weaker members of that class which was dominant\r\nduring the Middle Age have been sinking downward, often to the rank of\r\nmere day-labourers, and carrying downward with them--sometimes in a very\r\ntragical and pathetic fashion--somewhat of the dignity and the refinement\r\nwhich they had learnt from their ancestors.\r\n\r\nThus has the English nation (and as far as I can see, the Scotch\r\nlikewise) become more homogeneous than any nation of the Continent, if we\r\nexcept France since the extermination of the Frankish nobility.  And for\r\nthat very reason, as it seems to me, it is more fitted than any other\r\nEuropean nation for the exercise of equal political rights; and not to be\r\ndebarred of them by arguments drawn from countries which have been\r\ngoverned--as England has not been--by a caste.\r\n\r\nThe civilisation, not of mere book-learning, but of the heart; all that\r\nwas once meant by \"manners\"--good breeding, high feeling, respect for\r\nself and respect for others--are just as common (as far as I have seen)\r\namong the hand-workers of England and Scotland, as among any other class;\r\nthe only difference is, that these qualities develop more early in the\r\nricher classes, owing to that severe discipline of our public schools,\r\nwhich makes mere lads often fit to govern, because they have learnt to\r\nobey: while they develop later--generally not till middle age--in the\r\nclasses who have not gone through in their youth that Spartan training,\r\nand who indeed (from a mistaken conception of liberty) would not endure\r\nit for a day.  This and other social drawbacks which are but too patent,\r\nretard the manhood of the working classes.  That it should be so, is a\r\nwrong.  For if a citizen have one right above all others to demand\r\nanything of his country, it is that he should be educated; that whatever\r\ncapabilities he may have in him, however small, should have their fair\r\nand full chance of development.  But the cause of the wrong is not the\r\nexistence of a caste, or a privileged class, or of anything save the\r\nplain fact, that some men will be always able to pay more for their\r\nchildren's education than others; and that those children will,\r\ninevitably, win in the struggle of life.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in this fact is to be found the most weighty, if not the only\r\nargument against manhood suffrage, which would admit many--but too many,\r\nalas!--who are still mere boys in mind.  To a reasonable household\r\nsuffrage it cannot apply.  The man who (being almost certainly married,\r\nand having children) can afford to rent a 5 pound tenement in a town, or\r\nin the country either, has seen quite enough of life, and learnt quite\r\nenough of it, to form a very fair judgment of the man who offers to\r\nrepresent him in Parliament; because he has learnt, not merely something\r\nof his own interest, or that of his class, but--what is infinitely more\r\nimportant--the difference between the pretender and the honest man.\r\n\r\nThe causes of this state of society, which is peculiar to Britain, must\r\nbe sought far back in the ages.  It would seem that the distinction\r\nbetween \"earl and churl\" (the noble and the non-noble freeman) was\r\ncrushed out in this island by the two Norman conquests--that of the Anglo-\r\nSaxon nobility by Sweyn and Canute; and that of the Anglo-Danish nobility\r\nby William and his Frenchmen.  Those two terrible calamities, following\r\neach other in the short space of fifty years, seem to have welded\r\ntogether, by a community of suffering, all ranks and races, at least\r\nsouth of the Tweed; and when the English rose after the storm, they rose\r\nas one homogeneous people, never to be governed again by an originally\r\nalien race.  The English nobility were, from the time of Magna Charta,\r\nrather an official nobility, than, as in most continental countries, a\r\nseparate caste; and whatever caste tendencies had developed themselves\r\nbefore the Wars of the Roses (as such are certain to do during centuries\r\nof continued wealth and power), were crushed out by the great\r\nrevolutionary events of the next hundred years.  Especially did the\r\ndiscovery of the New World, the maritime struggle with Spain, the\r\noutburst of commerce and colonisation during the reigns of Elizabeth and\r\nJames, help toward this good result.  It was in vain for the Lord Oxford\r\nof the day, sneering at Raleigh's sudden elevation, to complain that as\r\non the virginals, so in the State, \"Jacks went up, and heads went down.\"\r\nThe proudest noblemen were not ashamed to have their ventures on the high\r\nseas, and to send their younger sons trading, or buccaneering, under the\r\nconduct of low-born men like Drake, who \"would like to see the gentleman\r\nthat would not set his hand to a rope, and hale and draw with the\r\nmariners.\"  Thus sprang up that respect for, even fondness for, severe\r\nbodily labour, which the educated class of no nation save our own has\r\never felt; and which has stood them in such good stead, whether at home\r\nor abroad.  Thus, too, sprang up the system of society by which (as the\r\nballad sets forth) the squire's son might be a \"'prentice good,\" and\r\nmarry\r\n\r\n   \"The bailiff's daughter dear\r\n   That dwelt at Islington,\"\r\n\r\nwithout tarnishing, as he would have done on the Continent, the scutcheon\r\nof his ancestors.  That which has saved England from a central despotism,\r\nsuch as crushed, during the eighteenth century, every nation on the\r\nContinent, is the very same peculiarity which makes the advent of the\r\nmasses to a share in political power safe and harmless; namely, the\r\nabsence of caste, or rather (for there is sure to be a moral fact\r\nunderlying and causing every political fact) the absence of that wicked\r\npride which perpetuates caste; forbidding those to intermarry whom nature\r\nand fact pronounce to be fit mates before God and man.\r\n\r\nThese views are not mine only.  They have been already set forth so much\r\nmore forcibly by M. de Tocqueville, that I should have thought it\r\nunnecessary to talk about them, were not the rhetorical phrases, \"Caste,\"\r\n\"Privileged Classes,\" \"Aristocratic Exclusiveness,\" and such-like,\r\nbandied about again just now, as if they represented facts.  If there\r\nremain in this kingdom any facts which correspond to those words, let\r\nthem be abolished as speedily as possible: but that such do remain was\r\nnot the opinion of the master of modern political philosophy, M. de\r\nTocqueville.\r\n\r\nHe expresses his surprise \"that the fact which distinguishes England from\r\nall other modern nations, and which alone can throw light on her\r\npeculiarities, . . . has not attracted more attention, . . . and that\r\nhabit has rendered it, as it were, imperceptible to the English\r\nthemselves--that England was the only country in which the system of\r\ncaste had been not only modified, but effectually destroyed.  The\r\nnobility and the middle classes followed the same business, embraced the\r\nsame professions, and, what is far more significant, intermarried with\r\neach other.  The daughter of the greatest nobleman\" (and this, if true of\r\nthe eighteenth century, has become far more true of the nineteenth)\r\n\"could already, without disgrace, marry a man of yesterday.\" . . .\r\n\r\n\"It has often been remarked that the English nobility has been more\r\nprudent, more able, and less exclusive than any other.  It would have\r\nbeen much nearer the truth to say, that in England, for a very long time\r\npast, no nobility, properly so called, have existed, if we take the word\r\nin the ancient and limited sense it has everywhere else retained.\" . . .\r\n\r\n\"For several centuries the word 'gentleman'\" (he might have added,\r\n\"burgess\") \"has altogether changed its meaning in England; and the word\r\n'roturier' has ceased to exist.  In each succeeding century it is applied\r\nto persons placed somewhat lower in the social scale\" (as the \"bagman\" of\r\nPickwick has become, and has deserved to become, the \"commercial\r\ngentleman\" of our day).  \"At length it travelled with the English to\r\nAmerica, where it is used to designate every citizen indiscriminately.\r\nIts history is that of democracy itself.\" . . .\r\n\r\n\"If the middle classes of England, instead of making war upon the\r\naristocracy, have remained so intimately connected with it, it is not\r\nespecially because the aristocracy is open to all, but rather, because\r\nits outline was indistinct, and its limit unknown: not so much because\r\nany man might be admitted into it, as because it was impossible to say\r\nwith certainty when he took rank there: so that all who approached it\r\nmight look on themselves as belonging to it; might take part in its rule,\r\nand derive either lustre or profit from its influence.\"\r\n\r\nJust so; and therefore the middle classes of Britain, of whatever their\r\nspecial political party, are conservative in the best sense of that word.\r\n\r\nFor there are not three, but only two, classes in England; namely, rich\r\nand poor: those who live by capital (from the wealthiest landlord to the\r\nsmallest village shopkeeper); and those who live by hand-labour.  Whether\r\nthe division between those two classes is increasing or not, is a very\r\nserious question.  Continued legislation in favour of the hand-labourer,\r\nand a beneficence towards him, when in need, such as no other nation on\r\nearth has ever shown, have done much to abolish the moral division.  But\r\nthe social division has surely been increased during the last half\r\ncentury, by the inevitable tendency, both in commerce and agriculture, to\r\nemploy one large capital, where several small ones would have been\r\nemployed a century ago.  The large manufactory, the large shop, the large\r\nestate, the large farm, swallows up the small ones.  The yeoman, the\r\nthrifty squatter who could work at two or three trades as well as till\r\nhis patch of moor, the hand-loom weaver, the skilled village craftsman,\r\nhave all but disappeared.  The handworker, finding it more and more\r\ndifficult to invest his savings, has been more and more tempted to\r\nsquander them.  To rise to the dignity of a capitalist, however small,\r\nwas growing impossible to him, till the rise of that co-operative\r\nmovement, which will do more than any social or political impulse in our\r\nday for the safety of English society, and the loyalty of the English\r\nworking classes.  And meanwhile--ere that movement shall have spread\r\nthroughout the length and breadth of the land, and have been applied, as\r\nit surely will be some day, not only to distribution, not only to\r\nmanufacture, but to agriculture likewise--till then, the best judges of\r\nthe working men's worth must be their employers; and especially the\r\nemployers of the northern manufacturing population.  What their judgment\r\nis, is sufficiently notorious.  Those who depend most on the working men,\r\nwho have the best opportunities of knowing them, trust them most\r\nthoroughly.  As long as great manufacturers stand forward as the\r\npolitical sponsors of their own workmen, it behoves those who cannot have\r\nhad their experience, to consider their opinion as conclusive.  As for\r\nthat \"influence of the higher classes\" which is said to be endangered\r\njust now; it will exist, just as much as it deserves to exist.  Any man\r\nwho is superior to the many, whether in talents, education, refinement,\r\nwealth, or anything else, will always be able to influence a number of\r\nmen--and if he thinks it worth his while, of votes--by just and lawful\r\nmeans.  And as for unjust and unlawful means, let those who prefer them\r\nkeep up heart.  The world will go on much as it did before; and be always\r\nquite bad enough to allow bribery and corruption, jobbery and nepotism,\r\nquackery and arrogance, their full influence over our home and foreign\r\npolicy.  An extension of the suffrage, however wide, will not bring about\r\nthe millennium.  It will merely make a large number of Englishmen\r\ncontented and loyal, instead of discontented and disloyal.  It may make,\r\ntoo, the educated and wealthy classes wiser by awakening a wholesome\r\nfear--perhaps, it may be, by awakening a chivalrous emulation.  It may\r\nput the younger men of the present aristocracy upon their mettle, and\r\nstir them up to prove that they are not in the same effete condition as\r\nwas the French noblesse in 1789.  It may lead them to take the warnings\r\nwhich have been addressed to them, for the last thirty years, by their\r\ntruest friends--often by kinsmen of their own.  It may lead them to ask\r\nthemselves why, in a world which is governed by a just God, such great\r\npower as is palpably theirs at present is entrusted to them, save that\r\nthey may do more work, and not less, than other men, under the penalties\r\npronounced against those to whom much is given, and of whom much is\r\nrequired.  It may lead them to discover that they are in a world where it\r\nis not safe to sit under the tree, and let the ripe fruit drop into your\r\nmouth; where the \"competition of species\" works with ruthless energy\r\namong all ranks of being, from kings upon their thrones to the weeds upon\r\nthe waste; where \"he that is not hammer, is sure to be anvil;\" and he who\r\nwill not work, neither shall he eat.  It may lead them to devote that\r\nenergy (in which they surpass so far the continental aristocracies) to\r\nsomething better than outdoor amusements or indoor dilettantisms.  There\r\nare those among them who, like one section of the old French noblesse,\r\ncontent themselves with mere complaints of \"the revolutionary tendencies\r\nof the age.\"  Let them beware in time; for when the many are on the\r\nmarch, the few who stand still are certain to be walked over.  There are\r\nthose among them who, like another section of the French noblesse, are\r\nready, more generously than wisely, to throw away their own social and\r\npolitical advantages, and play (for it will never be really more than\r\nplaying) at democracy.  Let them, too, beware.  The penknife and the axe\r\nshould respect each other; for they were wrought from the same steel: but\r\nthe penknife will not be wise in trying to fell trees.  Let them accept\r\ntheir own position, not in conceit and arrogance, but in fear and\r\ntrembling; and see if they cannot play the man therein, and save their\r\nown class; and with it, much which it has needed many centuries to\r\naccumulate and to organise, and without which no nation has yet existed\r\nfor a single century.  They are no more like the old French noblesse,\r\nthan are the commercial class like the old French bourgeoisie, or the\r\nlabouring like the old French peasantry.  Let them prove that fact by\r\ntheir deeds during the next generation; or sink into the condition of\r\nmere rich men, exciting, by their luxury and laziness, nothing but envy\r\nand contempt.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, behind all classes and social forces--I had almost said, above\r\nthem all--stands a fourth estate, which will, ultimately, decide the form\r\nwhich English society is to take: a Press as different from the literary\r\nclass of the Ancien Regime as is everything else English; and different\r\nin this--that it is free.\r\n\r\nThe French Revolution, like every revolution (it seems to me) which has\r\nconvulsed the nations of Europe for the last eighty years, was caused\r\nimmediately--whatever may have been its more remote causes--by the\r\nsuppression of thought; or, at least, by a sense of wrong among those who\r\nthought.  A country where every man, be he fool or wise, is free to speak\r\nthat which is in him, can never suffer a revolution.  The folly blows\r\nitself off like steam, in harmless noise; the wisdom becomes part of the\r\ngeneral intellectual stock of the nation, and prepares men for gradual,\r\nand therefore for harmless, change.\r\n\r\nAs long as the press is free, a nation is guaranteed against sudden and\r\ncapricious folly, either from above or from below.  As long as the press\r\nis free, a nation is guaranteed against the worse evil of persistent and\r\nobstinate folly, cloaking itself under the venerable shapes of tradition\r\nand authority.  For under a free press, a nation must ultimately be\r\nguided not by a caste, not by a class, not by mere wealth, not by the\r\npassions of a mob: but by mind; by the net result of all the common-sense\r\nof its members; and in the present default of genius, which is un-common\r\nsense, common-sense seems to be the only, if not the best, safeguard for\r\npoor humanity.\r\n\r\n1867\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE I--CASTE\r\n\r\n\r\n[Delivered at the Royal Institution, London, 1867.]\r\n\r\nThese Lectures are meant to be comments on the state of France before the\r\nFrench Revolution.  To English society, past or present, I do not refer.\r\nFor reasons which I have set forth at length in an introductory\r\ndiscourse, there never was any Ancien Regime in England.\r\n\r\nTherefore, when the Stuarts tried to establish in England a system which\r\nmight have led to a political condition like that of the Continent, all\r\nclasses combined and exterminated them; while the course of English\r\nsociety went on as before.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, England was the mother of every movement which\r\nundermined, and at last destroyed, the Ancien Regime.\r\n\r\nFrom England went forth those political theories which, transmitted from\r\nAmerica to France, became the principles of the French Revolution.  From\r\nEngland went forth the philosophy of Locke, with all its immense results.\r\nIt is noteworthy, that when Voltaire tries to persuade people, in a\r\ncertain famous passage, that philosophers do not care to trouble the\r\nworld--of the ten names to whom he does honour, seven names are English.\r\n\"It is,\" he says, \"neither Montaigne, nor Locke, nor Boyle, nor Spinoza,\r\nnor Hobbes, nor Lord Shaftesbury, nor Mr. Collins, nor Mr. Toland, nor\r\nFludd, nor Baker, who have carried the torch of discord into their\r\ncountries.\"  It is worth notice, that not only are the majority of these\r\nnames English, but that they belong not to the latter but to the former\r\nhalf of the eighteenth century; and indeed, to the latter half of the\r\nseventeenth.\r\n\r\nSo it was with that Inductive Physical Science, which helped more than\r\nall to break up the superstitions of the Ancien Regime, and to set man\r\nface to face with the facts of the universe.  From England, towards the\r\nend of the seventeenth century, it was promulgated by such men as Newton,\r\nBoyle, Sydenham, Ray, and the first founders of our Royal Society.\r\n\r\nIn England, too, arose the great religious movements of the seventeenth\r\nand eighteenth centuries--and especially that of a body which I can never\r\nmention without most deep respect--the Society of Friends.  At a time\r\nwhen the greater part of the Continent was sunk in spiritual sleep, these\r\nmen were reasserting doctrines concerning man, and his relation to his\r\nCreator, which, whether or not all believe them (as I believe them) to be\r\nfounded on eternal fact, all must confess to have been of incalculable\r\nbenefit to the cause of humanity and civilisation.\r\n\r\nFrom England, finally, about the middle of the eighteenth century, went\r\nforth--promulgated by English noblemen--that freemasonry which seems to\r\nhave been the true parent of all the secret societies of Europe.  Of this\r\ncurious question, more hereafter.  But enough has been said to show that\r\nEngland, instead of falling, at any period, into the stagnation of the\r\nAncien Regime, was, from the middle of the seventeenth century, in a\r\nstate of intellectual growth and ferment which communicated itself\r\nfinally to the continental nations.  This is the special honour of\r\nEngland; universally confessed at the time.  It was to England that the\r\nslowly-awakening nations looked, as the source of all which was noble,\r\ntrue, and free, in the dawning future.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, from what I have said, that I consider the Ancien Regime\r\nto begin in the seventeenth century.  I should date its commencement--as\r\nfar as that of anything so vague, unsystematic, indeed anarchic, can be\r\ndefined--from the end of the Thirty Years' War, and the peace of\r\nWestphalia in 1648.\r\n\r\nFor by that time the mighty spiritual struggles and fierce religious\r\nanimosities of the preceding century had worn themselves out.  And, as\r\nalways happens, to a period of earnest excitement had succeeded one of\r\nweariness, disgust, half-unbelief in the many questions for which so much\r\nblood had been shed.  No man had come out of the battle with altogether\r\nclean hands; some not without changing sides more than once.  The war had\r\nended as one, not of nations, not even of zealots, but of mercenaries.\r\nThe body of Europe had been pulled in pieces between them all; and the\r\npoor soul thereof--as was to be expected--had fled out through the gaping\r\nwounds.  Life, mere existence, was the most pressing need.  If men\r\ncould--in the old prophet's words--find the life of their hand, they were\r\ncontent.  High and low only asked to be let live.  The poor asked\r\nit--slaughtered on a hundred battle-fields, burnt out of house and home:\r\nvast tracts of the centre of Europe were lying desert; the population was\r\ndiminished for several generations.  The trading classes, ruined by the\r\nlong war, only asked to be let live, and make a little money.  The\r\nnobility, too, only asked to be let live.  They had lost, in the long\r\nstruggle, not only often lands and power, but their ablest and bravest\r\nmen; and a weaker and meaner generation was left behind, to do the\r\ngoverning of the world.  Let them live, and keep what they had.  If signs\r\nof vigour still appeared in France, in the wars of Louis XIV. they were\r\nfeverish, factitious, temporary--soon, as the event proved, to droop into\r\nthe general exhaustion.  If wars were still to be waged they were to be\r\nwars of succession, wars of diplomacy; not wars of principle, waged for\r\nthe mightiest invisible interests of man.  The exhaustion was general;\r\nand to it we must attribute alike the changes and the conservatism of the\r\nAncien Regime.  To it is owing that growth of a centralising despotism,\r\nand of arbitrary regal power, which M. de Tocqueville has set forth in a\r\nbook which I shall have occasion often to quote.  To it is owing, too,\r\nthat longing, which seems to us childish, after ancient forms,\r\netiquettes, dignities, court costumes, formalities diplomatic, legal,\r\necclesiastical.  Men clung to them as to keepsakes of the past--revered\r\nrelics of more intelligible and better-ordered times.  If the spirit had\r\nbeen beaten out of them in a century of battle, that was all the more\r\nreason for keeping up the letter.  They had had a meaning once, a life\r\nonce; perhaps there was a little life left in them still; perhaps the dry\r\nbones would clothe themselves with flesh once more, and stand upon their\r\nfeet.  At least it was useful that the common people should so believe.\r\nThere was good hope that the simple masses, seeing the old dignities and\r\nformalities still parading the streets, should suppose that they still\r\ncontained men, and were not mere wooden figures, dressed artistically in\r\nofficial costume.  And, on the whole, that hope was not deceived.  More\r\nthan a century of bitter experience was needed ere the masses discovered\r\nthat their ancient rulers were like the suits of armour in the Tower of\r\nLondon--empty iron astride of wooden steeds, and armed with lances which\r\nevery ploughboy could wrest out of their hands, and use in his own\r\nbehalf.\r\n\r\nThe mistake of the masses was pardonable.  For those suits of armour had\r\nonce held living men; strong, brave, wise; men of an admirable temper;\r\ndoing their work according to their light, not altogether well--what man\r\ndoes that on earth?--but well enough to make themselves necessary to, and\r\nloyally followed by, the masses whom they ruled.  No one can read fairly\r\nthe \"Gesta Dei per Francos in Oriente,\" or the deeds of the French\r\nNobility in their wars with England, or those tales--however legendary--of\r\nthe mediaeval knights, which form so noble an element in German\r\nliterature, without seeing, that however black were these men's\r\noccasional crimes, they were a truly noble race, the old Nobility of the\r\nContinent; a race which ruled simply because, without them, there would\r\nhave been naught but anarchy and barbarism.  To their chivalrous ideal\r\nthey were too often, perhaps for the most part, untrue: but, partial and\r\ndefective as it is, it is an ideal such as never entered into the mind of\r\nCelt or Gaul, Hun or Sclav; one which seems continuous with the spread of\r\nthe Teutonic conquerors.  They ruled because they did practically raise\r\nthe ideal of humanity in the countries which they conquered, a whole\r\nstage higher.  They ceased to rule when they were, through their own\r\nsins, caught up and surpassed in the race of progress by the classes\r\nbelow them.\r\n\r\nBut, even when at its best, their system of government had in it--like\r\nall human invention--original sin; an unnatural and unrighteous element,\r\nwhich was certain, sooner or later, to produce decay and ruin.  The old\r\nNobility of Europe was not a mere aristocracy.  It was a caste: a race\r\nnot intermarrying with the races below it.  It was not a mere\r\naristocracy.  For that, for the supremacy of the best men, all societies\r\nstrive, or profess to strive.  And such a true aristocracy may exist\r\nindependent of caste, or the hereditary principle at all.  We may\r\nconceive an Utopia, governed by an aristocracy which should be really\r\ndemocratic; which should use, under developed forms, that method which\r\nmade the mediaeval priesthood the one great democratic institution of old\r\nChristendom; bringing to the surface and utilising the talents and\r\nvirtues of all classes, even to the lowest.  We may conceive an\r\naristocracy choosing out, and gladly receiving into its own ranks as\r\nequals, every youth, every maiden, who was distinguished by intellect,\r\nvirtue, valour, beauty, without respect to rank or birth; and rejecting\r\nin turn, from its own ranks, each of its own children who fell below some\r\nlofty standard, and showed by weakliness, dulness, or baseness,\r\nincapacity for the post of guiding and elevating their fellow-citizens.\r\nThus would arise a true aristocracy; a governing body of the really most\r\nworthy--the most highly organised in body and in mind--perpetually\r\nrecruited from below: from which, or from any other ideal, we are yet a\r\nfew thousand years distant.\r\n\r\nBut the old Ancien Regime would have shuddered, did shudder, at such a\r\nnotion.  The supreme class was to keep itself pure, and avoid all taint\r\nof darker blood, shutting its eyes to the fact that some of its most\r\nfamous heroes had been born of such left-handed marriages as that of\r\nRobert of Normandy with the tanner's daughter of Falaise.  \"Some are so\r\ncurious in this behalf,\" says quaint old Burton, writing about 1650, \"as\r\nthese old Romans, our modern Venetians, Dutch, and French, that if two\r\nparties dearly love, the one noble, the other ignoble, they may not, by\r\ntheir laws, match, though equal otherwise in years, fortunes, education,\r\nand all good affection.  In Germany, except they can prove their\r\ngentility by three descents, they scorn to match with them.  A nobleman\r\nmust marry a noblewoman; a baron, a baron's daughter; a knight, a\r\nknight's.  As slaters sort their slates, do they degrees and families.\"\r\n\r\nAnd doubtless this theory--like all which have held their ground for many\r\ncenturies--at first represented a fact.  These castes were, at first,\r\nactually superior to the peoples over whom they ruled.  I cannot, as long\r\nas my eyes are open, yield to the modern theory of the equality--indeed\r\nof the non-existence--of races.  Holding, as I do, the primaeval unity of\r\nthe human race, I see in that race the same inclination to sport into\r\nfresh varieties, the same competition of species between those varieties,\r\nwhich Mr. Darwin has pointed out among plants and mere animals.  A\r\ndistinguished man arises; from him a distinguished family; from it a\r\ndistinguished tribe, stronger, cunninger than those around.  It asserts\r\nits supremacy over its neighbours at first exactly as a plant or animal\r\nwould do, by destroying, and, where possible, eating them; next, having\r\ngrown more prudent, by enslaving them; next, having gained a little\r\nmorality in addition to its prudence, by civilising them, raising them\r\nmore or less toward its own standard.  And thus, in every land,\r\ncivilisation and national life has arisen out of the patriarchal state;\r\nand the Eastern scheik, with his wives, free and slave, and his hundreds\r\nof fighting men born in his house, is the type of all primaeval rulers.\r\nHe is the best man of his horde--in every sense of the word best; and\r\nwhether he have a right to rule them or not, they consider that he has,\r\nand are the better men for his guidance.\r\n\r\nWhether this ought to have been the history of primaeval civilisation, is\r\na question not to be determined here.  That it is the history thereof, is\r\nsurely patent to anyone who will imagine to himself what must have been.\r\nIn the first place, the strongest and cunningest savage must have had the\r\nchance of producing children more strong and cunning than the average; he\r\nwould have--the strongest savage has still--the power of obtaining a\r\nwife, or wives, superior in beauty and in household skill, which involves\r\nsuperiority of intellect; and therefore his children would--some of them\r\nat least--be superior to the average, both from the father's and the\r\nmother's capacities.  They again would marry select wives; and their\r\nchildren again would do the same; till, in a very few generations, a\r\nfamily would have established itself, considerably superior to the rest\r\nof the tribe in body and mind, and become assuredly its ruling race.\r\n\r\nAgain, if one of that race invented a new weapon, a new mode of tillage,\r\nor aught else which gave him power, that would add to the superiority of\r\nhis whole family.  For the invention would be jealously kept among them\r\nas a mystery, a hereditary secret.  To this simple cause, surely, is to\r\nbe referred the system of hereditary caste occupations, whether in Egypt\r\nor Hindoostan.  To this, too, the fact that alike in Greek and in\r\nTeutonic legend the chief so often appears, not merely as the best\r\nwarrior and best minstrel, but as the best smith, armourer, and\r\nhandicraftsman of his tribe.  If, however, the inventor happened to be a\r\nlow-born genius, its advantages would still accrue to the ruling race.\r\nFor nothing could be more natural or more easy--as more than one legend\r\nintimates--than that the king should extort the new secret from his\r\nsubject, and then put him to death to prevent any further publicity.\r\n\r\nTwo great inventive geniuses we may see dimly through the abysses of the\r\npast, both of whom must have become in their time great chiefs, founders\r\nof mighty aristocracies--it may be, worshipped after their death as gods.\r\n\r\nThe first, who seems to have existed after the age in which the black\r\nrace colonised Australia, must have been surely a man worthy to hold rank\r\nwith our Brindleys, Watts, and Stephensons.  For he invented (and mind,\r\none man must have invented the thing first, and by the very nature of it,\r\ninvented it all at once) an instrument so singular, unexpected, unlike\r\nanything to be seen in nature, that I wonder it has not been called, like\r\nthe plough, the olive, or the vine, a gift of the immortal gods: and yet\r\nan instrument so simple, so easy, and so perfect, that it spread over all\r\nraces in Europe and America, and no substitute could be found for it till\r\nthe latter part of the fifteenth century.  Yes, a great genius was he,\r\nand the consequent founder of a great aristocracy and conquering race,\r\nwho first invented for himself and his children after him a--bow and\r\narrow.\r\n\r\nThe next--whether before or after the first in time, it suits me to speak\r\nof him in second place--was the man who was the potential ancestor of the\r\nwhole Ritterschaft, Chivalry, and knightly caste of Europe; the man who\r\nfirst, finding a foal upon the steppe, deserted by its dam, brought it\r\nhome, and reared it; and then bethought him of the happy notion of making\r\nit draw--presumably by its tail--a fashion which endured long in Ireland,\r\nand had to be forbidden by law, I think as late as the sixteenth century.\r\nA great aristocrat must that man have become.  A greater still he who\r\nfirst substituted the bit for the halter.  A greater still he who first\r\nthought of wheels.  A greater still he who conceived the yoke and pole\r\nfor bearing up his chariot; for that same yoke, and pole, and chariot,\r\nbecame the peculiar instrument of conquerors like him who mightily\r\noppressed the children of Israel, for he had nine hundred chariots of\r\niron.  Egyptians, Syrians, Assyrians, Greeks, Romans--none of them\r\nimproved on the form of the conquering biga, till it was given up by a\r\nrace who preferred a pair of shafts to their carts, and who had learnt to\r\nride instead of drive.  A great aristocrat, again, must he have been\r\namong those latter races who first conceived the notion of getting on his\r\nhorse's back, accommodating his motions to the beast's, and becoming a\r\ncentaur, half-man, half-horse.  That invention must have tended, in the\r\nfirst instance, as surely toward democracy as did the invention of\r\nfirearms.  A tribe of riders must have been always, more or less, equal\r\nand free.  Equal because a man on a horse would feel himself a man\r\nindeed; because the art of riding called out an independence, a\r\nself-help, a skill, a consciousness of power, a personal pride and\r\nvanity, which would defy slavery.  Free, because a tribe of riders might\r\nbe defeated, exterminated, but never enchained.  They could never become\r\n_gleboe adscripti_, bound to the soil, as long as they could take horse\r\nand saddle, and away.  History gives us more than one glimpse of such\r\ntribes--the scourge and terror of the non-riding races with whom they\r\ncame in contact.  Some, doubtless, remember how in the wars between\r\nAlfred and the Danes, \"the army\" (the Scandinavian invaders) again and\r\nagain horse themselves, steal away by night from the Saxon infantry, and\r\nride over the land (whether in England or in France), \"doing unspeakable\r\nevil.\"  To that special instinct of horsemanship, which still\r\ndistinguishes their descendants, we may attribute mainly the Scandinavian\r\nsettlement of the north and east of England.  Some, too, may recollect\r\nthe sketch of the primeval Hun, as he first appeared to the astonished\r\nand disgusted old Roman soldier Ammianus Marcellinus; the visages \"more\r\nlike cakes than faces;\" the \"figures like those which are hewn out with\r\nan axe on the poles at bridge-ends;\" the rat-skin coats, which they wore\r\ntill they rotted off their limbs; their steaks of meat cooked between the\r\nsaddle and the thigh; the little horses on which \"they eat and drink, buy\r\nand sell, and sleep lying forward along his narrow neck, and indulging in\r\nevery variety of dream.\"  And over and above, and more important\r\npolitically, the common councils \"held on horseback, under the authority\r\nof no king, but content with the irregular government of nobles, under\r\nwhose leading they force their way through all obstacles.\"  A race--like\r\nthose Cossacks who are probably their lineal descendants--to be feared,\r\nto be hired, to be petted, but not to be conquered.\r\n\r\nInstances nearer home of free equestrian races we have in our own English\r\nborderers, among whom (as Mr. Froude says) the farmers and their farm-\r\nservants had but to snatch their arms and spring into their saddles and\r\nthey became at once the Northern Horse, famed as the finest light cavalry\r\nin the world.  And equal to them--superior even, if we recollect that\r\nthey preserved their country's freedom for centuries against the superior\r\nforce of England--were those troops of Scots who, century after century,\r\nswept across the border on their little garrons, their bag of oatmeal\r\nhanging by the saddle, with the iron griddle whereon to bake it; careless\r\nof weather and of danger; men too swift to be exterminated, too\r\nindependent to be enslaved.\r\n\r\nBut if horsemanship had, in these cases, a levelling tendency it would\r\nhave the very opposite when a riding tribe conquered a non-riding one.\r\nThe conquerors would, as much as possible, keep the art and mystery of\r\nhorsemanship hereditary among themselves, and become a Ritterschaft or\r\nchivalrous caste.  And they would be able to do so: because the conquered\r\nrace would not care or dare to learn the new and dangerous art.  There\r\nare persons, even in England, who can never learn to ride.  There are\r\nwhole populations in Europe, even now, when races have become almost\r\nindistinguishably mixed, who seem unable to learn.  And this must have\r\nbeen still more the case when the races were more strongly separated in\r\nblood and habits.  So the Teutonic chief, with his gesitha, comites, or\r\nselect band of knights, who had received from him, as Tacitus has it, the\r\nwar-horse and the lance, established himself as the natural ruler--and\r\noppressor--of the non-riding populations; first over the aborigines of\r\nGermany proper, tribes who seem to have been enslaved, and their names\r\nlost, before the time of Tacitus; and then over the non-riding Romans and\r\nGauls to the South and West, and the Wendish and Sclavonic tribes to the\r\nEast.  Very few in numbers, but mighty in their unequalled capacity of\r\nbody and mind, and in their terrible horsemanship, the Teutonic\r\nRitterschaft literally rode roughshod over the old world; never checked,\r\nbut when they came in contact with the free-riding hordes of the Eastern\r\nsteppes; and so established an equestrian caste, of which the [Greek\r\ntext] of Athens and the Equites of Rome had been only hints ending in\r\nfailure and absorption.\r\n\r\nOf that equestrian caste the symbol was the horse.  The favourite, and\r\ntherefore the chosen sacrifice of Odin, their ancestor and God, the\r\nhorse's flesh was eaten at the sacrificial meal; the horse's head, hung\r\non the ash in Odin's wood, gave forth oracular responses.  As\r\nChristianity came in, and the eating of horse-flesh was forbidden as\r\nimpiety by the Church, while his oracles dwindled down to such as that\r\nwhich Falada's dead head gives to the goose-girl in the German tale, the\r\nmagic power of the horse figured only in ballads and legends: but his\r\nreal power remained.\r\n\r\nThe art of riding became an hereditary and exclusive science--at last a\r\npedantry, hampered by absurd etiquettes, and worse than useless\r\ntraditions; but the power and right to ride remained on the whole the\r\nmark of the dominant caste.  Terribly did they often abuse that special\r\npower.  The faculty of making a horse carry him no more makes a man a\r\ngood man, than the faculties of making money, making speeches, making\r\nbooks, or making a noise about public abuses.  And of all ruffians, the\r\nworst, if history is to be trusted, is the ruffian on a horse; to whose\r\nbrutality of mind is superadded the brute power of his beast.  A ruffian\r\non a horse--what is there that he will not ride over, and ride on,\r\ncareless and proud of his own shame?  When the ancient chivalry of France\r\ndescended to that level, or rather delegated their functions to\r\nmercenaries of that level--when the knightly hosts who fought before\r\nJerusalem allowed themselves to be superseded by the dragoons and\r\ndragonnades of Louis XIV.--then the end of the French chivalry was at\r\nhand, and came.  But centuries before that shameful fall there had come\r\nin with Christianity the new thought, that domination meant\r\nresponsibility; that responsibility demanded virtue.  The words which\r\ndenoted rank, came to denote likewise high moral excellencies.  The\r\nnobilis, or man who was known, and therefore subject to public opinion,\r\nwas bound to behave nobly.  The gentleman--gentile-man--who respected his\r\nown gens, or family and pedigree, was bound to be gentle.  The courtier,\r\nwho had picked up at court some touch of Roman civilisation from Roman\r\necclesiastics, was bound to be courteous.  He who held an \"honour\" or\r\n\"edel\" of land was bound to be honourable; and he who held a \"weorthig,\"\r\nor worthy, thereof, was bound himself to be worthy.  In like wise, he who\r\nhad the right to ride a horse, was expected to be chivalrous in all\r\nmatters befitting the hereditary ruler, who owed a sacred debt to a long\r\nline of forefathers, as well as to the state in which he dwelt; all\r\ndignity, courtesy, purity, self-restraint, devotion--such as they were\r\nunderstood in those rough days--centred themselves round the idea of the\r\nrider as the attributes of the man whose supposed duty, as well as his\r\nsupposed right, was to govern his fellow-men, by example, as well as by\r\nlaw and force;--attributes which gathered themselves up into that one\r\nword--Chivalry: an idea, which, perfect or imperfect, God forbid that\r\nmankind should ever forget, till it has become the possession--as it is\r\nthe God-given right--of the poorest slave that ever trudged on foot; and\r\nevery collier-lad shall have become--as some of those Barnsley men proved\r\nbut the other day they had become already:\r\n\r\n   A very gentle perfect knight.\r\n\r\nVery unfaithful was chivalry to its ideal--as all men are to all ideals.\r\nBut bear in mind, that if the horse was the symbol of the ruling caste,\r\nit was not at first its only strength.  Unless that caste had had at\r\nfirst spiritual, as well as physical force on its side, it would have\r\nbeen soon destroyed--nay, it would have destroyed itself--by internecine\r\ncivil war.  And we must believe that those Franks, Goths, Lombards, and\r\nBurgunds, who in the early Middle Age leaped on the backs (to use Mr.\r\nCarlyle's expression) of the Roman nations, were actually, in all senses\r\nof the word, better men than those whom they conquered.  We must believe\r\nit from reason; for if not, how could they, numerically few, have held\r\nfor a year, much more for centuries, against millions, their dangerous\r\nelevation?  We must believe it, unless we take Tacitus's \"Germania,\"\r\nwhich I absolutely refuse to do, for a romance.  We must believe that\r\nthey were better than the Romanised nations whom they conquered, because\r\nthe writers of those nations, Augustine, Salvian, and Sidonius\r\nApollinaris, for example, say that they were such, and give proof\r\nthereof.  Not good men according to our higher standard--far from it;\r\nthough Sidonius's picture of Theodoric, the East Goth, in his palace of\r\nNarbonne, is the picture of an eminently good and wise ruler.  But not\r\ngood, I say, as a rule--the Franks, alas! often very bad men: but still\r\nbetter, wiser, abler, than those whom they ruled.  We must believe too,\r\nthat they were better, in every sense of the word, than those tribes on\r\ntheir eastern frontier, whom they conquered in after centuries, unless we\r\ndiscredit (which we have no reason to do) the accounts which the Roman\r\nand Greek writers give of the horrible savagery of those tribes.\r\n\r\nSo it was in later centuries.  One cannot read fairly the history of the\r\nMiddle Ages without seeing that the robber knight of Germany or of\r\nFrance, who figures so much in modern novels, must have been the\r\nexception, and not the rule: that an aristocracy which lived by the\r\nsaddle would have as little chance of perpetuating itself, as a\r\npriesthood composed of hypocrites and profligates; that the mediaeval\r\nNobility has been as much slandered as the mediaeval Church; and the\r\nexceptions taken--as more salient and exciting--for the average: that\r\nside by side with ruffians like Gaston de Foix hundreds of honest\r\ngentlemen were trying to do their duty to the best of their light, and\r\nwere raising, and not depressing, the masses below them--one very\r\nimportant item in that duty being, the doing the whole fighting of the\r\ncountry at their own expense, instead of leaving it to a standing army of\r\nmercenaries, at the beck and call of a despot; and that, as M. de\r\nTocqueville says: \"In feudal times, the Nobility were regarded pretty\r\nmuch as the government is regarded in our own; the burdens they imposed\r\nwere endured in consequence of the security they afforded.  The nobles\r\nhad many irksome privileges; they possessed many onerous rights: but they\r\nmaintained public order, they administered justice, they caused the law\r\nto be executed, they came to the relief of the weak, they conducted the\r\nbusiness of the community.  In proportion as they ceased to do these\r\nthings, the burden of their privileges appeared more oppressive, and\r\ntheir existence became an anomaly in proportion as they ceased to do\r\nthese things.\"  And the Ancien Regime may be defined as the period in\r\nwhich they ceased to do these things--in which they began to play the\r\nidlers, and expected to take their old wages without doing their old\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nBut in any case, government by a ruling caste, whether of the patriarchal\r\nor of the feudal kind, is no ideal or permanent state of society.  So far\r\nfrom it, it is but the first or second step out of primeval savagery.  For\r\nthe more a ruling race becomes conscious of its own duty, and not merely\r\nof its own power--the more it learns to regard its peculiar gifts as\r\nentrusted to it for the good of men--so much the more earnestly will it\r\nlabour to raise the masses below to its own level, by imparting to them\r\nits own light; and so will it continually tend to abolish itself, by\r\nproducing a general equality, moral and intellectual; and fulfil that law\r\nof self-sacrifice which is the beginning and the end of all virtue.\r\n\r\nA race of noblest men and women, trying to make all below them as noble\r\nas themselves--that is at least a fair ideal, tending toward, though it\r\nhas not reached, the highest ideal of all.\r\n\r\nBut suppose that the very opposite tendency--inherent in the heart of\r\nevery child of man--should conquer.  Suppose the ruling caste no longer\r\nthe physical, intellectual, and moral superiors of the mass, but their\r\nequals.  Suppose them--shameful, but not without example--actually sunk\r\nto be their inferiors.  And that such a fall did come--nay, that it must\r\nhave come--is matter of history.  And its cause, like all social causes,\r\nwas not a political nor a physical, but a moral cause.  The profligacy of\r\nthe French and Italian aristocracies, in the sixteenth century, avenged\r\nitself on them by a curse (derived from the newly-discovered America)\r\nfrom which they never recovered.  The Spanish aristocracy suffered, I\r\ndoubt not very severely.  The English and German, owing to the superior\r\nhomeliness and purity of ruling their lives, hardly at all.  But the\r\ncontinental caste, instead of recruiting their tainted blood by healthy\r\nblood from below, did all, under pretence of keeping it pure, to keep it\r\ntainted by continual intermarriage; and paid, in increasing weakness of\r\nbody and mind, the penalty of their exclusive pride.  It is impossible\r\nfor anyone who reads the French memoirs of the sixteenth and seventeenth\r\ncenturies, not to perceive, if he be wise, that the aristocracy therein\r\ndepicted was ripe for ruin--yea, already ruined--under any form of\r\ngovernment whatsoever, independent of all political changes.  Indeed,\r\nmany of the political changes were not the causes but the effects of the\r\ndemoralisation of the noblesse.  Historians will tell you how, as early\r\nas the beginning of the seventeenth century, Henry IV. complained that\r\nthe nobles were quitting their country districts; how succeeding kings\r\nand statesmen, notably Richelieu and Louis XIV., tempted the noblesse up\r\nto Paris, that they might become mere courtiers, instead of powerful\r\ncountry gentlemen; how those who remained behind were only the poor\r\n_hobereaux_, little hobby-hawks among the gentry, who considered it\r\ndegradation to help in governing the parish, as their forefathers had\r\ngoverned it, and lived shabbily in their chateaux, grinding the last\r\nfarthing out of their tenants, that they might spend it in town during\r\nthe winter.  No wonder that with such an aristocracy, who had renounced\r\nthat very duty of governing the country, for which alone they and their\r\nforefathers had existed, there arose government by intendants and sub-\r\ndelegates, and all the other evils of administrative centralisation,\r\nwhich M. de Tocqueville anatomises and deplores.  But what was the cause\r\nof the curse?  Their moral degradation.  What drew them up to Paris save\r\nvanity and profligacy?  What kept them from intermarrying with the middle\r\nclass save pride?  What made them give up the office of governors save\r\nidleness?  And if vanity, profligacy, pride, and idleness be not\r\ninjustices and moral vices, what are?\r\n\r\nThe race of heroic knights and nobles who fought under the walls of\r\nJerusalem--who wrestled, and not in vain, for centuries with the equally\r\nheroic English, in defence of their native soil--who had set to all\r\nEurope the example of all knightly virtues, had rotted down to this;\r\ntheir only virtue left, as Mr. Carlyle says, being--a perfect readiness\r\nto fight duels.\r\n\r\nEvery Intendant, chosen by the Comptroller-General out of the lower-born\r\nmembers of the Council of State; a needy young plebeian with his fortune\r\nto make, and a stranger to the province, was, in spite of his greed,\r\nambition, chicane, arbitrary tyranny, a better man--abler, more\r\nenergetic, and often, to judge from the pages of De Tocqueville, with far\r\nmore sympathy and mercy for the wretched peasantry--than was the count or\r\nmarquis in the chateau above, who looked down on him as a roturier; and\r\nlet him nevertheless become first his deputy, and then his master.\r\n\r\nUnderstand me--I am not speaking against the hereditary principle of the\r\nAncien Regime, but against its caste principle--two widely different\r\nelements, continually confounded nowadays.\r\n\r\nThe hereditary principle is good, because it is founded on fact and\r\nnature.  If men's minds come into the world blank sheets of paper--which\r\nI much doubt--every other part and faculty of them comes in stamped with\r\nhereditary tendencies and peculiarities.  There are such things as\r\ntransmitted capabilities for good and for evil; and as surely as the\r\noffspring of a good horse or dog is likely to be good, so is the\r\noffspring of a good man, and still more of a good woman.  If the parents\r\nhave any special ability, their children will probably inherit it, at\r\nleast in part; and over and above, will have it developed in them by an\r\neducation worthy of their parents and themselves.  If man were--what he\r\nis not--a healthy and normal species, a permanent hereditary caste might\r\ngo on intermarrying, and so perpetuate itself.  But the same moral reason\r\nwhich would make such a caste dangerous--indeed, fatal to the liberty and\r\ndevelopment of mankind, makes it happily impossible.  Crimes and follies\r\nare certain, after a few generations, to weaken the powers of any human\r\ncaste; and unless it supplements its own weakness by mingling again with\r\nthe common stock of humanity, it must sink under that weakness, as the\r\nancient noblesse sank by its own vice.  Of course there were exceptions.\r\nThe French Revolution brought those exceptions out into strong light; and\r\nlike every day of judgment, divided between the good and the evil.  But\r\nit lies not in exceptions to save a caste, or an institution; and a few\r\nRichelieus, Liancourts, Rochefoucaulds, Noailles, Lafayettes were but the\r\nstorks among the cranes involved in the wholesale doom due not to each\r\nindividual, but to a system and a class.\r\n\r\nProfligacy, pride, idleness--these are the vices which we have to lay to\r\nthe charge of the Teutonic Nobility of the Ancien Regime in France\r\nespecially; and (though in a less degree perhaps) over the whole\r\ncontinent of Europe.  But below them, and perhaps the cause of them all,\r\nlay another and deeper vice--godlessness--atheism.\r\n\r\nI do not mean merely want of religion, doctrinal unbelief.  I mean want\r\nof belief in duty, in responsibility.  Want of belief that there was a\r\nliving God governing the universe, who had set them their work, and would\r\njudge them according to their work.  And therefore, want of belief, yea,\r\nutter unconsciousness, that they were set in their places to make the\r\nmasses below them better men; to impart to them their own civilisation,\r\nto raise them to their own level.  They would have shrunk from that which\r\nI just now defined as the true duty of an aristocracy, just because it\r\nwould have seemed to them madness to abolish themselves.  But the process\r\nof abolition went on, nevertheless, only now from without instead of from\r\nwithin.  So it must always be, in such a case.  If a ruling class will\r\nnot try to raise the masses to their own level, the masses will try to\r\ndrag them down to theirs.  That sense of justice which allowed\r\nprivileges, when they were as strictly official privileges as the salary\r\nof a judge, or the immunity of a member of the House of Commons; when\r\nthey were earned, as in the Middle Age, by severe education, earnest\r\nlabour, and life and death responsibility in peace and war, will demand\r\nthe abolition of those privileges, when no work is done in return for\r\nthem, with a voice which must be heard, for it is the voice of truth and\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nBut with that righteous voice will mingle another, most wicked, and yet,\r\nalas! most flattering to poor humanity--the voice of envy, simple and\r\nundisguised; of envy, which moralists hold to be one of the basest of\r\nhuman passions; which can never be justified, however hateful or unworthy\r\nbe the envied man.  And when a whole people, or even a majority thereof,\r\nshall be possessed by that, what is there that they will not do?\r\n\r\nSome are surprised and puzzled when they find, in the French Revolution\r\nof 1793, the noblest and the foulest characters labouring in concert, and\r\nside by side--often, too, paradoxical as it may seem, united in the same\r\npersonage.  The explanation is simple.  Justice inspired the one; the\r\nother was the child of simple envy.  But this passion of envy, if it\r\nbecomes permanent and popular, may avenge itself, like all other sins.  A\r\nnation may say to itself, \"Provided we have no superiors to fall our\r\npride, we are content.  Liberty is a slight matter, provided we have\r\nequality.  Let us be slaves, provided we are all slaves alike.\"  It may\r\ndestroy every standard of humanity above its own mean average; it may\r\nforget that the old ruling class, in spite of all its defects and crimes,\r\ndid at least pretend to represent something higher than man's necessary\r\nwants, plus the greed of amassing money; never meeting (at least in the\r\ncountry districts) any one wiser or more refined than an official or a\r\npriest drawn from the peasant class, it may lose the belief that any\r\nstandard higher than that is needed; and, all but forgetting the very\r\nexistence of civilisation, sink contented into a dead level of\r\nintellectual mediocrity and moral barbarism, crying, \"Let us eat and\r\ndrink, for to-morrow we die.\"\r\n\r\nA nation in such a temper will surely be taken at its word.  Where the\r\ncarcase is, there the eagles will be gathered together; and there will\r\nnot be wanting to such nations--as there were not wanting in old Greece\r\nand Rome--despots who will give them all they want, and more, and say to\r\nthem: \"Yes, you shall eat and drink; and yet you shall not die.  For I,\r\nwhile I take care of your mortal bodies, will see that care is taken of\r\nyour immortal souls.\"\r\n\r\nFor there are those who have discovered, with the kings of the Holy\r\nAlliance, that infidelity and scepticism are political mistakes, not so\r\nmuch because they promote vice, as because they promote (or are supposed\r\nto promote) free thought; who see that religion (no matter of what\r\nquality) is a most valuable assistant to the duties of a minister of\r\npolice.  They will quote in their own behalf Montesquieu's opinion that\r\nreligion is a column necessary to sustain the social edifice; they will\r\nquote, too, that sound and true saying of De Tocqueville's: {1} \"If the\r\nfirst American who might be met, either in his own country, or abroad,\r\nwere to be stopped and asked whether he considered religion useful to the\r\nstability of the laws and the good order of society, he would answer,\r\nwithout hesitation, that no civilised society, but more especially none\r\nin a state of freedom, can exist without religion.  Respect for religion\r\nis, in his eyes, the greatest guarantee of the stability of the State,\r\nand of the safety of the community.  Those who are ignorant of the\r\nscience of government, know that fact at least.\"\r\n\r\nM. de Tocqueville, when he wrote these words, was lamenting that in\r\nFrance, \"freedom was forsaken;\" \"a thing for which it is said that no one\r\nany longer cares in France.\"  He did not, it seems to me, perceive that,\r\nas in America the best guarantee of freedom is the reverence for a\r\nreligion or religions, which are free themselves, and which teach men to\r\nbe free; so in other countries the best guarantee of slavery is,\r\nreverence for religions which are not free, and which teach men to be\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\nBut what M. de Tocqueville did not see, there are others who will see;\r\nwho will say: \"If religion be the pillar of political and social order,\r\nthere is an order which is best supported by a religion which is adverse\r\nto free thought, free speech, free conscience, free communion between man\r\nand God.  The more enervating the superstition, the more exacting and\r\ntyrannous its priesthood, the more it will do our work, if we help it to\r\ndo its own.  If it permit us to enslave the body, we will permit it to\r\nenslave the soul.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so may be inaugurated a period of that organised anarchy of which the\r\npoet says:\r\n\r\n   It is not life, but death, when nothing stirs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE II--CENTRALISATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe degradation of the European nobility caused, of course, the increase\r\nof the kingly power, and opened the way to central despotisms.  The\r\nbourgeoisie, the commercial middle class, whatever were its virtues, its\r\nvalue, its real courage, were never able to stand alone against the\r\nkings.  Their capital, being invested in trade, was necessarily subject\r\nto such sudden dangers from war, political change, bad seasons, and so\r\nforth, that its holders, however individually brave, were timid as a\r\nclass.  They could never hold out on strike against the governments, and\r\nhad to submit to the powers that were, whatever they were, under penalty\r\nof ruin.\r\n\r\nBut on the Continent, and especially in France and Germany, unable to\r\nstrengthen itself by intermarriage with the noblesse, they retained that\r\ntimidity which is the fruit of the insecurity of trade; and had to submit\r\nto a more and more centralised despotism, and grow up as they could, in\r\nthe face of exasperating hindrances to wealth, to education, to the\r\npossession, in many parts of France, of large landed estates; leaving the\r\nnoblesse to decay in isolated uselessness and weakness, and in many cases\r\ndebt and poverty.\r\n\r\nThe system--or rather anarchy--according to which France was governed\r\nduring this transitional period, may be read in that work of M. de\r\nTocqueville's which I have already quoted, and which is accessible to all\r\nclasses, through Mr. H. Reeve's excellent translation.  Every student of\r\nhistory is, of course, well acquainted with that book.  But as there is\r\nreason to fear, from language which is becoming once more too common,\r\nboth in speech and writing, that the general public either do not know\r\nit, or have not understood it, I shall take the liberty of quoting from\r\nit somewhat largely.  I am justified in so doing by the fact that M. de\r\nTocqueville's book is founded on researches into the French Archives,\r\nwhich have been made (as far as I am aware) only by him; and contains\r\ninnumerable significant facts, which are to be found (as far as I am\r\naware) in no other accessible work.\r\n\r\nThe French people--says M. de Tocqueville--made, in 1789, the greatest\r\neffort which was ever made by any nation to cut, so to speak, their\r\ndestiny in halves, and to separate by an abyss that which they had\r\nheretofore been, from that which they sought to become hereafter.  But he\r\nhad long thought that they had succeeded in this singular attempt much\r\nless than was supposed abroad; and less than they had at first supposed\r\nthemselves.  He was convinced that they had unconsciously retained, from\r\nthe former state of society, most of the sentiments, the habits, and even\r\nthe opinions, by means of which they had effected the destruction of that\r\nstate of things; and that, without intending it, they had used its\r\nremains to rebuild the edifice of modern society.  This is his thesis,\r\nand this he proves, it seems to me, incontestably by documentary\r\nevidence.  Not only does he find habits which we suppose--or supposed\r\ntill lately--to have died with the eighteenth century, still living and\r\nworking, at least in France, in the nineteenth, but the new opinions\r\nwhich we look on usually as the special children of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, he shows to have been born in the eighteenth.  France, he\r\nconsiders, is still at heart what the Ancien Regime made her.\r\n\r\nHe shows that the hatred of the ruling caste, the intense determination\r\nto gain and keep equality, even at the expense of liberty, had been long\r\ngrowing up, under those influences of which I spoke in my first lecture.\r\n\r\nHe shows, moreover, that the acquiescence in a centralised\r\nadministration; the expectation that the government should do everything\r\nfor the people, and nothing for themselves; the consequent loss of local\r\nliberties, local peculiarities; the helplessness of the towns and the\r\nparishes: and all which issued in making Paris France, and subjecting the\r\nwhole of a vast country to the arbitrary dictates of a knot of despots in\r\nthe capital, was not the fruit of the Revolution, but of the Ancien\r\nRegime which preceded it; and that Robespierre and his \"Comite de Salut\r\nPublic,\" and commissioners sent forth to the four winds of heaven in\r\nbonnet rouge and carmagnole complete, to build up and pull down,\r\naccording to their wicked will, were only handling, somewhat more\r\nroughly, the same wires which had been handled for several generations by\r\nthe Comptroller-General and Council of State, with their provincial\r\nintendants.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know,\" said Law to the Marquis d'Argenson, \"that this kingdom of\r\nFrance is governed by thirty intendants?  You have neither parliament,\r\nnor estates, nor governors.  It is upon thirty masters of request,\r\ndespatched into the provinces, that their evil or their good, their\r\nfertility or their sterility, entirely depend.\"\r\n\r\nTo do everything for the people, and let them do nothing for\r\nthemselves--this was the Ancien Regime.  To be more wise and more loving\r\nthan Almighty God, who certainly does not do everything for the sons of\r\nmen, but forces them to labour for themselves by bitter need, and after a\r\nmost Spartan mode of education; who allows them to burn their hands as\r\noften as they are foolish enough to put them into the fire; and to be\r\nfilled with the fruits of their own folly, even though the folly be one\r\nof necessary ignorance; treating them with that seeming neglect which is\r\nafter all the most provident care, because by it alone can men be trained\r\nto experience, self-help, science, true humanity; and so become not\r\ntolerably harmless dolls, but men and women worthy of the name; with\r\n\r\n   The reason firm, the temperate will,\r\n   Endurance, foresight, strength, and skill;\r\n   The perfect spirit, nobly planned\r\n   To cheer, to counsel, and command.\r\n\r\nSuch seems to be the education and government appointed for man by the\r\nvoluntatem Dei in rebus revelatum, and the education, therefore, which\r\nthe man of science will accept and carry out.  But the men of the Ancien\r\nRegime--in as far as it was a Regime at all--tried to be wiser than the\r\nAlmighty.  Why not?  They were not the first, nor will be the last, by\r\nmany who have made the same attempt.  So this Council of State settled\r\narbitrarily, not only taxes, and militia, and roads, but anything and\r\neverything.  Its members meddled, with their whole hearts and minds.  They\r\ntried to teach agriculture by schools and pamphlets and prizes; they sent\r\nout plans for every public work.  A town could not establish an octroi,\r\nlevy a rate, mortgage, sell, sue, farm, or administer their property,\r\nwithout an order in council.  The Government ordered public rejoicings,\r\nsaw to the firing of salutes, and illuminating of houses--in one case\r\nmentioned by M. de Tocqueville, they fined a member of the burgher guard\r\nfor absenting himself from a Te Deum.  All self-government was gone.  A\r\ncountry parish was, says Turgot, nothing but \"an assemblage of cabins,\r\nand of inhabitants as passive as the cabins they dwelt in.\"  Without an\r\norder of council, the parish could not mend the steeple after a storm, or\r\nrepair the parsonage gable.  If they grumbled at the intendant, he threw\r\nsome of the chief persons into prison, and made the parish pay the\r\nexpenses of the horse patrol, which formed the arbitrary police of\r\nFrance.  Everywhere was meddling.  There were reports on\r\nstatistics--circumstantial, inaccurate, and useless--as statistics are\r\ntoo often wont to be.  Sometimes, when the people were starving, the\r\nGovernment sent down charitable donations to certain parishes, on\r\ncondition that the inhabitants should raise a sum on their part.  When\r\nthe sum offered was sufficient, the Comptroller-General wrote on the\r\nmargin, when he returned the report to the intendant, \"Good--express\r\nsatisfaction.\"  If it was more than sufficient, he wrote, \"Good--express\r\nsatisfaction and sensibility.\"  There is nothing new under the sun.  In\r\n1761, the Government, jealous enough of newspapers, determined to start\r\none for itself, and for that purpose took under its tutelage the _Gazette\r\nde France_.  So the public newsmongers were of course to be the\r\nprovincial intendants, and their sub-newsmongers, of course, the\r\nsub-delegates.\r\n\r\nBut alas! the poor sub-delegates seem to have found either very little\r\nnews, or very little which it was politic to publish.  One reports that a\r\nsmuggler of salt has been hung, and has displayed great courage; another\r\nthat a woman in his district has had three girls at a birth; another that\r\na dreadful storm has happened, but--has done no mischief; a fourth--living\r\nin some specially favoured Utopia--declares that in spite of all his\r\nefforts he has found nothing worth recording, but that he himself will\r\nsubscribe to so useful a journal, and will exhort all respectable persons\r\nto follow his example: in spite of which loyal endeavours, the journal\r\nseems to have proved a failure, to the great disgust of the king and his\r\nminister, who had of course expected to secure fine weather by nailing,\r\nlike the schoolboy before a holiday, the hand of the weather-glass.\r\n\r\nWell had it been, if the intermeddling of this bureaucracy had stopped\r\nthere.  But, by a process of evocation (as it was called), more and more\r\ncauses, criminal as well as civil, were withdrawn from the regular\r\ntribunals, to those of the intendants and the Council.  Before the\r\nintendant all the lower order of people were generally sent for trial.\r\nBread-riots were a common cause of such trials, and M. de Tocqueville\r\nasserts that he has found sentences, delivered by the intendant, and a\r\nlocal council chosen by himself, by which men were condemned to the\r\ngalleys, and even to death.  Under such a system, under which an\r\nintendant must have felt it his interest to pretend at all risks, that\r\nall was going right, and to regard any disturbance as a dangerous\r\nexposure of himself and his chiefs--one can understand easily enough that\r\nscene which Mr. Carlyle has dramatised from Lacretelle, concerning the\r\ncanaille, the masses, as we used to call them a generation since:\r\n\r\n\"A dumb generation--their voice only an inarticulate cry.  Spokesman, in\r\nthe king's council, in the world's forum, they have none that finds\r\ncredence.  At rare intervals (as now, in 1775) they will fling down their\r\nhoes, and hammers; and, to the astonishment of mankind, flock hither and\r\nthither, dangerous, aimless, get the length even of Versailles.  Turgot\r\nis altering the corn trade, abrogating the absurdest corn laws; there is\r\ndearth, real, or were it even factitious, an indubitable scarcity of\r\nbroad.  And so, on the 2nd day of May, 1775, these waste multitudes do\r\nhere, at Versailles chateau, in widespread wretchedness, in sallow faces,\r\nsqualor, winged raggedness, present as in legible hieroglyphic writing\r\ntheir petition of grievances.  The chateau-gates must be shut; but the\r\nking will appear on the balcony and speak to them.  They have seen the\r\nking's face; their petition of grievances has been, if not read, looked\r\nat.  In answer, two of them are hanged, on a new gallows forty feet high,\r\nand the rest driven back to their dens for a time.\"\r\n\r\nOf course.  What more exasperating and inexpiable insult to the ruling\r\npowers was possible than this?  To persist in being needy and wretched,\r\nwhen a whole bureaucracy is toiling day and night to make them prosperous\r\nand happy?  An insult only to be avenged in blood.  Remark meanwhile,\r\nthat this centralised bureaucracy was a failure; that after all the\r\ntrouble taken to govern these masses, they were not governed, in the\r\nsense of being made better, and not worse.  The truth is, that no\r\ncentralised bureaucracy, or so-called \"paternal government,\" yet invented\r\non earth, has been anything but a failure, or is it like to be anything\r\nelse: because it is founded on an error; because it regards and treats\r\nmen as that which they are not, as things; and not as that which they\r\nare, as persons.  If the bureaucracy were a mere Briareus giant, with a\r\nhundred hands, helping the weak throughout the length and breadth of the\r\nempire, the system might be at least tolerable.  But what if the\r\nGovernment were not a Briareus with a hundred hands, but a Hydra with a\r\nhundred heads and mouths, each far more intent on helping itself than on\r\nhelping the people?  What if sub-delegates and other officials, holding\r\noffice at the will of the intendant, had to live, and even provide\r\nagainst a rainy day?  What if intendants, holding office at the will of\r\nthe Comptroller-General, had to do more than live, and found it prudent\r\nto realise as large a fortune as possible, not only against disgrace, but\r\nagainst success, and the dignity fit for a new member of the Noblesse de\r\nla Robe?  Would not the system, then, soon become intolerable?  Would\r\nthere not be evil times for the masses, till they became something more\r\nthan masses?\r\n\r\nIt is an ugly name, that of \"The Masses,\" for the great majority of human\r\nbeings in a nation.  He who uses it speaks of them not as human beings,\r\nbut as things; and as things not bound together in one living body, but\r\nlying in a fortuitous heap.  A swarm of ants is not a mass.  It has a\r\npolity and a unity.  Not the ants but the fir-needles and sticks, of\r\nwhich the ants have piled their nest, are a mass.\r\n\r\nThe term, I believe, was invented during the Ancien Regime.  Whether it\r\nwas or not, it expresses very accurately the life of the many in those\r\ndays.  No one would speak, if he wished to speak exactly, of the masses\r\nof the United States; for there every man is, or is presumed to be, a\r\npersonage; with his own independence, his own activities, his own rights\r\nand duties.  No one, I believe, would have talked of the masses in the\r\nold feudal times; for then each individual was someone's man, bound to\r\nhis master by ties of mutual service, just or unjust, honourable or base,\r\nbut still giving him a personality of duties and rights, and dividing him\r\nfrom his class.\r\n\r\nDividing, I say.  The poor of the Middle Age had little sense of a common\r\nhumanity.  Those who owned allegiance to the lord in the next valley were\r\nnot their brothers; and at their own lord's bidding, they buckled on\r\nsword and slew the next lord's men, with joyful heart and good\r\nconscience.  Only now and then misery compressed them into masses; and\r\nthey ran together, as sheep run together to face a dog.  Some wholesale\r\nwrong made them aware that they were brothers, at least in the power of\r\nstarving; and they joined in the cry which was heard, I believe, in\r\nMecklenburg as late as 1790: \"Den Edelman wille wi dodschlagen.\"  Then,\r\nin Wat Tyler's insurrections, in Munster Anabaptisms, in Jacqueries, they\r\nproved themselves to be masses, if nothing better, striking for awhile,\r\nby the mere weight of numbers, blows terrible, though aimless--soon to be\r\ndispersed and slain in their turn by a disciplined and compact\r\naristocracy.  Yet not always dispersed, if they could find a leader; as\r\nthe Polish nobles discovered to their cost in the middle of the\r\nseventeenth century.  Then Bogdan the Cossack, a wild warrior, not\r\nwithout his sins, but having deserved well of James Sobieski and the\r\nPoles, found that the neighbouring noble's steward had taken a fancy to\r\nhis windmill and his farm upon the Dnieper.  He was thrown into prison on\r\na frivolous charge, and escaped to the Tatars, leaving his wife\r\ndishonoured, his house burnt, his infant lost in the flames, his eldest\r\nson scourged for protesting against the wrong.  And he returned, at the\r\nhead of an army of Tatars, Socinians, Greeks, or what not, to set free\r\nthe serfs, and exterminate Jesuits, Jews, and nobles, throughout Podolia,\r\nVolhynia, Red Russia; to desecrate the altars of God, and slay his\r\nservants; to destroy the nobles by lingering tortures; to strip noble\r\nladies and maidens, and hunt them to death with the whips of his\r\nCossacks; and after defeating the nobles in battle after battle, to\r\ninaugurate an era of misery and anarchy from which Poland never\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\nThus did the masses of Southern Poland discover, for one generation at\r\nleast, that they were not many things, but one thing; a class, capable of\r\nbrotherhood and unity, though, alas! only of such as belongs to a pack of\r\nwolves.  But such outbursts as this were rare exceptions.  In general,\r\nfeudalism kept the people divided, and therefore helpless.  And as\r\nfeudalism died out, and with it the personal self-respect and loyalty\r\nwhich were engendered by the old relations of master and servant, the\r\ndivision still remained; and the people, in France especially, became\r\nmerely masses, a swarm of incoherent and disorganised things intent on\r\nthe necessaries of daily bread, like mites crawling over each other in a\r\ncheese.\r\n\r\nOut of this mass were struggling upwards perpetually, all who had a\r\nlittle ambition, a little scholarship, or a little money, endeavouring to\r\nbecome members of the middle class by obtaining a Government appointment.\r\n\"A man,\" says M. de Tocqueville, \"endowed with some education and small\r\nmeans, thought it not decorous to die without having been a Government\r\nofficer.\"  \"Every man, according to his condition,\" says a contemporary\r\nwriter, \"wants to be something by command of the king.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not merely the \"natural vanity\" of which M. de Tocqueville accuses\r\nhis countrymen, which stirred up in them this eagerness after place; for\r\nwe see the same eagerness in other nations of the Continent, who cannot\r\nbe accused (as wholes) of that weakness.  The fact is, a Government\r\nplace, or a Government decoration, cross, ribbon, or what not, is, in a\r\ncountry where self-government is unknown or dead, the only method, save\r\nliterary fame, which is left to men in order to assert themselves either\r\nto themselves or their fellow-men.\r\n\r\nA British or American shopkeeper or farmer asks nothing of his\r\nGovernment.  He can, if he chooses, be elected to some local office\r\n(generally unsalaried) by the votes of his fellow-citizens.  But that is\r\nhis right, and adds nothing to his respectability.  The test of that\r\nlatter, in a country where all honest callings are equally honourable, is\r\nthe amount of money he can make; and a very sound practical test that is,\r\nin a country where intellect and capital are free.  Beyond that, he is\r\nwhat he is, and wishes to be no more, save what he can make himself.  He\r\nhas his rights, guaranteed by law and public opinion; and as long as he\r\nstands within them, and (as he well phrases it) behaves like a gentleman,\r\nhe considers himself as good as any man; and so he is.  But under the\r\nbureaucratic Regime of the Continent, if a man had not \"something by\r\ncommand of the king,\" he was nothing; and something he naturally wished\r\nto be, even by means of a Government which he disliked and despised.  So\r\nin France, where innumerable petty posts were regular articles of sale,\r\nanyone, it seems, who had saved a little money, found it most profitable\r\nto invest it in a beadledom of some kind--to the great detriment of the\r\ncountry, for he thus withdrew his capital from trade; but to his own\r\nclear gain, for he thereby purchased some immunity from public burdens,\r\nand, as it were, compounded once and for all for his taxes.  The petty\r\nGerman princes, it seems, followed the example of France, and sold their\r\nlittle beadledoms likewise; but even where offices were not sold, they\r\nmust be obtained by any and every means, by everyone who desired not to\r\nbe as other men were, and to become Notables, as they were called in\r\nFrance; so he migrated from the country into the nearest town, and became\r\na member of some small body-guild, town council, or what not, bodies\r\nwhich were infinite in number.  In one small town M. de Tocqueville\r\ndiscovers thirty-six such bodies, \"separated from each other by\r\ndiminutive privileges, the least honourable of which was still a mark of\r\nhonour.\"  Quarrelling perpetually with each other for precedence,\r\ndespising and oppressing the very _menu peuple_ from whom they had for\r\nthe most part sprung, these innumerable small bodies, instead of uniting\r\ntheir class, only served to split it up more and more; and when the\r\nRevolution broke them up, once and for all, with all other privileges\r\nwhatsoever, no bond of union was left; and each man stood alone, proud of\r\nhis \"individuality\"--his complete social isolation; till he discovered\r\nthat, in ridding himself of superiors, he had rid himself also of\r\nfellows; fulfilling, every man in his own person, the old fable of the\r\nbundle of sticks; and had to submit, under the Consulate and the Empire,\r\nto a tyranny to which the Ancien Regime was freedom itself.\r\n\r\nFor, in France at least, the Ancien Regime was no tyranny.  The middle\r\nand upper classes had individual liberty--it may be, only too much; the\r\nliberty of disobeying a Government which they did not respect.  \"However\r\nsubmissive the French may have been before the Revolution to the will of\r\nthe king, one sort of obedience was altogether unknown to them.  They\r\nknew not what it was to bow before an illegitimate and contested power--a\r\npower but little honoured, frequently despised, but willingly endured\r\nbecause it may be serviceable, or because it may hurt.  To that degrading\r\nform of servitude they were ever strangers.  The king inspired them with\r\nfeelings . . . which have become incomprehensible to this generation . . .They loved him with the affection due to a father; they revered him\r\nwith the respect due to God.  In submitting to the most arbitrary of his\r\ncommands, they yielded less to compulsion than to loyalty; and thus they\r\nfrequently preserved great freedom of mind, even in the most complete\r\ndependence.  This liberty, irregular, intermittent,\" says M. de\r\nTocqueville, \"helped to form those vigorous characters, those proud and\r\ndaring spirits, which were to make the French Revolution at once the\r\nobject of the admiration and the terror of succeeding generations.\"\r\n\r\nThis liberty--too much akin to anarchy, in which indeed it issued for\r\nawhile--seems to have asserted itself in continual petty resistance to\r\nofficials whom they did not respect, and who, in their turn, were more\r\nthan a little afraid of the very men out of whose ranks they had sprung.\r\n\r\nThe French Government--one may say, every Government on the Continent in\r\nthose days--had the special weakness of all bureaucracies; namely, that\r\nwant of moral force which compels them to fall back at last on physical\r\nforce, and transforms the ruler into a bully, and the soldier into a\r\npoliceman and a gaoler.  A Government of parvenus, uncertain of its own\r\nposition, will be continually trying to assert itself to itself, by\r\nvexatious intermeddling and intruding pretensions; and then, when it\r\nmeets with the resistance of free and rational spirits, will either\r\nrecoil in awkward cowardice, or fly into a passion, and appeal to the\r\nhalter and the sword.  Such a Government can never take itself for\r\ngranted, because it knows that it is not taken for granted by the people.\r\nIt never can possess the quiet assurance, the courteous dignity, without\r\nswagger, yet without hesitation, which belongs to hereditary legislators;\r\nby which term is to be understood, not merely kings, not merely noblemen,\r\nbut every citizen of a free nation, however democratic, who has received\r\nfrom his forefathers the right, the duty, and the example of\r\nself-government.\r\n\r\nSuch was the political and social state of the Ancien Regime, not only in\r\nFrance, but if we are to trust (as we must trust) M. de Tocqueville, in\r\nalmost every nation in Europe, except Britain.\r\n\r\nAnd as for its moral state.  We must look for that--if we have need,\r\nwhich happily all have not--in its lighter literature.\r\n\r\nI shall not trouble you with criticisms on French memoirs--of which those\r\nof Madame de Sevigne are on the whole, the most painful (as witness her\r\ncomments on the Marquise de Brinvilliers's execution), because written by\r\na woman better and more human than ordinary.  Nor with \"Menagiana,\" or\r\nother 'ana's--as vain and artificial as they are often foul; nor with\r\nnovels and poems, long since deservedly forgotten.  On the first perusal\r\nof this lighter literature, you will be charmed with the ease, grace,\r\nlightness with which everything is said.  On the second, you will be\r\nsomewhat cured of your admiration, as you perceive how little there is to\r\nsay.  The head proves to be nothing but a cunning mask, with no brains\r\ninside.  Especially is this true of a book, which I must beg those who\r\nhave read it already, to recollect.  To read it I recommend no human\r\nbeing.  We may consider it, as it was considered in its time, the typical\r\nnovel of the Ancien Regime.  A picture of Spanish society, written by a\r\nFrenchman, it was held to be--and doubtless with reason--a picture of the\r\nwhole European world.  Its French editor (of 1836) calls it a _grande\r\nepopee_; \"one of the most prodigious efforts of intelligence, exhausting\r\nall forms of humanity\"--in fact, a second Shakespeare, according to the\r\nlights of the year 1715.  I mean, of course, \"Gil Blas.\"  So picturesque\r\nis the book, that it has furnished inexhaustible motifs to the\r\ndraughtsman.  So excellent is its workmanship, that the enthusiastic\r\neditor of 1836 tells us--and doubtless he knows best--that it is the\r\nclassic model of the French tongue; and that, as Le Sage \"had embraced\r\nall that belonged to man in his composition, he dared to prescribe to\r\nhimself to embrace the whole French language in his work.\"  It has been\r\nthe parent of a whole school of literature--the Bible of tens of\r\nthousands, with admiring commentators in plenty; on whose souls may God\r\nhave mercy!\r\n\r\nAnd no wonder.  The book has a solid value, and will always have, not\r\nmerely from its perfect art (according to its own measure and intention),\r\nbut from its perfect truthfulness.  It is the Ancien Regime itself.  It\r\nset forth to the men thereof, themselves, without veil or cowardly\r\nreticence of any kind; and inasmuch as every man loves himself, the\r\nAncien Regime loved \"Gil Blas,\" and said, \"The problem of humanity is\r\nsolved at last.\"  But, ye long-suffering powers of heaven, what a\r\nsolution!  It is beside the matter to call the book ungodly, immoral,\r\nbase.  Le Sage would have answered: \"Of course it is; for so is the world\r\nof which it is a picture.\"  No; the most notable thing about the book is\r\nits intense stupidity; its dreariness, barrenness, shallowness, ignorance\r\nof the human heart, want of any human interest.  If it be an epos, the\r\nactors in it are not men and women, but ferrets--with here and there, of\r\ncourse, a stray rabbit, on whose brains they may feed.  It is the inhuman\r\nmirror of an inhuman age, in which the healthy human heart can find no\r\nmore interest than in a pathological museum.\r\n\r\nThat last, indeed, \"Gil Blas\" is; a collection of diseased specimens.  No\r\nman or woman in the book, lay or clerical, gentle or simple, as far as I\r\ncan remember, do their duty in any wise, even if they recollect that they\r\nhave any duty to do.  Greed, chicane, hypocrisy, uselessness are the\r\nruling laws of human society.  A new book of Ecclesiastes, crying,\r\n\"Vanity of vanity, all is vanity;\" the \"conclusion of the whole matter\"\r\nbeing left out, and the new Ecclesiastes rendered thereby diabolic,\r\ninstead of like that old one, divine.  For, instead of \"Fear God and keep\r\nhis commandments, for that is the whole duty of main,\" Le Sage sends\r\nforth the new conclusion, \"Take care of thyself, and feed on thy\r\nneighbours, for that is the whole duty of man.\"  And very faithfully was\r\nhis advice (easy enough to obey at all times) obeyed for nearly a century\r\nafter \"Gil Blas\" appeared.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time there appeared, by a remarkable coincidence, another\r\nwork, like it the child of the Ancien Regime, and yet as opposite to it\r\nas light to darkness.  If Le Sage drew men as they were, Fenelon tried at\r\nleast to draw them as they might have been and still might be, were they\r\ngoverned by sages and by saints, according to the laws of God.\r\n\"Telemaque\" is an ideal--imperfect, doubtless, as all ideals must be in a\r\nworld in which God's ways and thoughts are for ever higher than man's;\r\nbut an ideal nevertheless.  If its construction is less complete than\r\nthat of \"Gil Blas,\" it is because its aim is infinitely higher; because\r\nthe form has to be subordinated, here and there, to the matter.  If its\r\npolitical economy be imperfect, often chimerical, it is because the mind\r\nof one man must needs have been too weak to bring into shape and order\r\nthe chaos, social and economic, which he saw around him.  M. de\r\nLamartine, in his brilliant little life of Fenelon, does not hesitate to\r\ntrace to the influence of \"Telemaque,\" the Utopias which produced the\r\nrevolutions of 1793 and 1848.  \"The saintly poet was,\" he says, \"without\r\nknowing it, the first Radical and the first communist of his century.\"\r\nBut it is something to have preached to princes doctrines till then\r\nunknown, or at least forgotten for many a generation--free trade, peace,\r\ninternational arbitration, and the \"carriere ouverte aux talents\" for all\r\nranks.  It is something to have warned his generation of the dangerous\r\novergrowth of the metropolis; to have prophesied, as an old Hebrew might\r\nhave done, that the despotism which he saw around him would end in a\r\nviolent revolution.  It is something to have combined the highest\r\nChristian morality with a hearty appreciation of old Greek life; of its\r\nreverence for bodily health and prowess; its joyous and simple country\r\nsociety; its sacrificial feasts, dances, games; its respect for the gods;\r\nits belief that they helped, guided, inspired the sons of men.  It is\r\nsomething to have himself believed in God; in a living God, who, both in\r\nthis life and in all lives to come, rewarded the good and punished the\r\nevil by inevitable laws.  It is something to have warned a young prince,\r\nin an age of doctrinal bigotry and practical atheism, that a living God\r\nstill existed, and that his laws were still in force; to have shown him\r\nTartarus crowded with the souls of wicked monarchs, while a few of kingly\r\nrace rested in Elysium, and among them old pagans--Inachus, Cecrops,\r\nErichthon, Triptolemus, and Sesostris--rewarded for ever for having done\r\ntheir duty, each according to his light, to the flocks which the gods had\r\ncommitted to their care.  It is something to have spoken to a prince, in\r\nsuch an age, without servility, and without etiquette, of the frailties\r\nand the dangers which beset arbitrary rulers; to have told him that\r\nroyalty, \"when assumed to content oneself, is a monstrous tyranny; when\r\nassumed to fulfil its duties, and to conduct an innumerable people as a\r\nfather conducts his children, a crushing slavery, which demands an heroic\r\ncourage and patience.\"\r\n\r\nLet us honour the courtier who dared speak such truths; and still more\r\nthe saintly celibate who had sufficient catholicity of mind to envelop\r\nthem in old Grecian dress, and, without playing false for a moment to his\r\nown Christianity, seek in the writings of heathen sages a wider and a\r\nhealthier view of humanity than was afforded by an ascetic creed.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that the appearance of \"Telemaque,\" published in Holland\r\nwithout the permission of Fenelon, delighted throughout Europe that\r\npublic which is always delighted with new truths, as long as it is not\r\nrequired to practise them.  To read \"Telemaque\" was the right and the\r\nenjoyment of everyone.  To obey it, the duty only of princes.  No wonder\r\nthat, on the other hand, this \"Vengeance de peuples, lecon des rois,\" as\r\nM. de Lamartine calls it, was taken for the bitterest satire by Louis\r\nXIV., and completed the disgrace of one who had dared to teach the future\r\nking of France that he must show himself, in all things, the opposite of\r\nhis grandfather.  No wonder if Madame de Maintenon and the court looked\r\non its portraits of wicked ministers and courtiers as caricatures of\r\nthemselves; portraits too, which, \"composed thus in the palace of\r\nVersailles, under the auspices of that confidence which the king had\r\nplaced in the preceptor of his heir, seemed a domestic treason.\"  No\r\nwonder, also, if the foolish and envious world outside was of the same\r\nopinion; and after enjoying for awhile this exposure of the great ones of\r\nthe earth, left \"Telemaque\" as an Utopia with which private folks had no\r\nconcern; and betook themselves to the easier and more practical model of\r\n\"Gil Blas.\"\r\n\r\nBut there are solid defects in \"Telemaque\"--indicating corresponding\r\ndefects in the author's mind--which would have, in any case, prevented\r\nits doing the good work which Fenelon desired; defects which are natural,\r\nas it seems to me, to his position as a Roman Catholic priest, however\r\nsaintly and pure, however humane and liberal.  The king, with him, is to\r\nbe always the father of his people; which is tantamount to saying, that\r\nthe people are to be always children, and in a condition of tutelage;\r\nvoluntary, if possible: if not, of tutelage still.  Of self-government,\r\nand education of human beings into free manhood by the exercise of self-\r\ngovernment, free will, free thought--of this Fenelon had surely not a\r\nglimpse.  A generation or two passed by, and then the peoples of Europe\r\nbegan to suspect that they were no longer children, but come to manhood;\r\nand determined (after the example of Britain and America) to assume the\r\nrights and duties of manhood, at whatever risk of excesses or mistakes:\r\nand then \"Telemaque\" was relegated--half unjustly--as the slavish and\r\nchildish dream of a past age, into the schoolroom, where it still\r\nremains.\r\n\r\nBut there is a defect in \"Telemaque\" which is perhaps deeper still.  No\r\nwoman in it exercises influence over man, except for evil.  Minerva, the\r\nguiding and inspiring spirit, assumes of course, as Mentor, a male form;\r\nbut her speech and thought is essentially masculine, and not feminine.\r\nAntiope is a mere lay-figure, introduced at the end of the book because\r\nTelemachus must needs be allowed to have hope of marrying someone or\r\nother.  Venus plays but the same part as she does in the Tannenhauser\r\nlegends of the Middle Age.  Her hatred against Telemachus is an integral\r\nelement of the plot.  She, with the other women or nymphs of the romance,\r\nin spite of all Fenelon's mercy and courtesy towards human frailties,\r\nreally rise no higher than the witches of the Malleus Maleficanum.\r\nWoman--as the old monk held who derived femina from fe, faith, and minus,\r\nless, because women have less faith than men--is, in \"Telemaque,\"\r\nwhenever she thinks or acts, the temptress, the enchantress; the victim\r\n(according to a very ancient calumny) of passions more violent, often\r\nmore lawless, than man's.\r\n\r\nSuch a conception of women must make \"Telemaque,\" to the end of time,\r\nuseless as a wholesome book of education.  It must have crippled its\r\ninfluence, especially in France, in its own time.  For there, for good\r\nand for evil, woman was asserting more and more her power, and her right\r\nto power, over the mind and heart of man.  Rising from the long\r\ndegradation of the Middle Ages, which had really respected her only when\r\nunsexed and celibate, the French woman had assumed, often lawlessly,\r\nalways triumphantly, her just freedom; her true place as the equal, the\r\ncoadjutor, the counsellor of man.  Of all problems connected with the\r\neducation of a young prince, that of the influence of woman was, in the\r\nFrance of the Ancien Regime, the most important.  And it was just that\r\nwhich Fenelon did not, perhaps dared not, try to touch; and which he most\r\ncertainly could not have solved.  Meanwhile, not only Madame de\r\nMaintenon, but women whose names it were a shame to couple with hers,\r\nmust have smiled at, while they hated, the saint who attempted to\r\ndispense not only with them, but with the ideal queen who should have\r\nbeen the helpmeet of the ideal king.\r\n\r\nTo those who believe that the world is governed by a living God, it may\r\nseem strange, at first sight, that this moral anarchy was allowed to\r\nendure; that the avenging, and yet most purifying storm of the French\r\nRevolution, inevitable from Louis XIV.'s latter years, was not allowed to\r\nburst two generations sooner than it did.  Is not the answer--that the\r\nquestion always is not of destroying the world, but of amending it?  And\r\nthat amendment must always come from within, and not from without?  That\r\nmen must be taught to become men, and mend their world themselves?  To\r\neducate men into self-government--that is the purpose of the government\r\nof God; and some of the men of the eighteenth century did not learn that\r\nlesson.  As the century rolled on, the human mind arose out of the slough\r\nin which Le Sage found it, into manifold and beautiful activity,\r\nincreasing hatred of shams and lies, increasing hunger after truth and\r\nusefulness.  With mistakes and confusions innumerable they worked: but\r\nstill they worked; planting good seed; and when the fire of the French\r\nRevolution swept over the land, it burned up the rotten and the withered,\r\nonly to let the fresh herbage spring up from underneath.\r\n\r\nBut that purifying fire was needed.  If we inquire why the many attempts\r\nto reform the Ancien Regime, which the eighteenth century witnessed, were\r\nfailures one and all; why Pombal failed in Portugal, Aranda in Spain,\r\nJoseph II. in Austria, Ferdinand and Caroline in Naples--for these last,\r\nbe it always remembered, began as humane and enlightened sovereigns,\r\npatronising liberal opinions, and labouring to ameliorate the condition\r\nof the poor, till they were driven by the murder of Marie Antoinette into\r\na paroxysm of rage and terror--why, above all, Louis XVI., who attempted\r\ndeeper and wiser reforms than any other sovereign, failed more\r\ndisastrously than any--is not the answer this, that all these reforms\r\nwould but have cleansed the outside of the cup and the platter, while\r\nthey left the inside full of extortion and excess?  It was not merely\r\ninstitutions which required to be reformed, but men and women.  The\r\nspirit of \"Gil Blas\" had to be cast out.  The deadness, selfishness,\r\nisolation of men's souls; their unbelief in great duties, great common\r\ncauses, great self-sacrifices--in a word, their unbelief in God, and\r\nthemselves, and mankind--all that had to be reformed; and till that was\r\ndone all outward reform would but have left them, at best, in brute ease\r\nand peace, to that soulless degradation, which (as in the Byzantine\r\nempire of old, and seeming in the Chinese empire of to-day) hides the\r\nreality of barbarism under a varnish of civilisation.  Men had to be\r\nawakened; to be taught to think for themselves, act for themselves, to\r\ndare and suffer side by side for their country and for their children; in\r\na word, to arise and become men once more.\r\n\r\nAnd, what is more, men had to punish--to avenge.  Those are fearful\r\nwords.  But there is, in this God-guided universe, a law of retribution,\r\nwhich will find men out, whether men choose to find it out or not; a law\r\nof retribution; of vengeance inflicted justly, though not necessarily by\r\njust men.  The public executioner was seldom a very estimable personage,\r\nat least under the old Regime; and those who have been the scourges of\r\nGod have been, in general, mere scourges, and nothing better; smiting\r\nblindly, rashly, confusedly; confounding too often the innocent with the\r\nguilty, till they have seemed only to punish crime by crime, and replace\r\nold sins by new.  But, however insoluble, however saddening that puzzle\r\nbe, I must believe--as long as I believe in any God at all--that such men\r\nas Robespierre were His instruments, even in their crimes.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the French Revolution, indeed, the wickedness of certain\r\nof its leaders was part of the retribution itself.  For the noblesse\r\nexisted surely to make men better.  It did, by certain classes, the very\r\nopposite.  Therefore it was destroyed by wicked men, whom it itself had\r\nmade wicked.  For over and above all political, economic, social wrongs,\r\nthere were wrongs personal, human, dramatic; which stirred not merely the\r\nsprings of covetousness or envy, or even of a just demand for the freedom\r\nof labour and enterprise: but the very deepest springs of rage, contempt,\r\nand hate; wrongs which caused, as I believe, the horrors of the\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nIt is notorious how many of the men most deeply implicated in those\r\nhorrors were of the artist class--by which I signify not merely painters\r\nand sculptors--as the word artist has now got, somewhat strangely, to\r\nsignify, at least in England--but what the French meant by\r\n_artistes_--producers of luxuries and amusements, play-actors, musicians,\r\nand suchlike, down to that \"distracted peruke-maker with two fiery\r\ntorches,\" who, at the storm of the Bastile, \"was for burning the\r\nsaltpetres of the Arsenal, had not a woman run screaming; had not a\r\npatriot, with some tincture of natural philosophy, instantly struck the\r\nwind out of him, with butt of musket on pit of stomach, overturned the\r\nbarrels, and stayed the devouring element.\"  The distracted peruke-maker\r\nmay have had his wrongs--perhaps such a one as that of poor Triboulet the\r\nfool, in \"Le Roi s'amuse\"--and his own sound reasons for blowing down the\r\nBastile, and the system which kept it up.\r\n\r\nFor these very ministers of luxury--then miscalled art--from the periwig-\r\nmaker to the play-actor--who like them had seen the frivolity, the\r\nbaseness, the profligacy, of the rulers to whose vices they pandered,\r\nwhom they despised while they adored!  Figaro himself may have looked up\r\nto his master the Marquis as a superior being as long as the law enabled\r\nthe Marquis to send him to the Bastile by a lettre de cachet; yet Figaro\r\nmay have known and seen enough to excuse him, when lettres de cachet were\r\nabolished, for handing the Marquis over to a Comite de Salut Public.\r\nDisappointed play-actors, like Collet d'Herbois; disappointed poets, like\r\nFabre d'Olivet, were, they say, especially ferocious.  Why not?\r\nIngenious, sensitive spirits, used as lap-dogs and singing-birds by men\r\nand women whom they felt to be their own flesh and blood, they had, it\r\nmay be, a juster appreciation of the actual worth of their patrons than\r\nhad our own Pitt and Burke.  They had played the valet: and no man was a\r\nhero to them.  They had seen the nobleman expose himself before his own\r\nhelots: they would try if the helot was not as good as the nobleman.  The\r\nnobleman had played the mountebank: why should not the mountebank, for\r\nonce, play the nobleman?  The nobleman's God had been his five senses,\r\nwith (to use Mr. Carlyle's phrase) the sixth sense of vanity: why should\r\nnot the mountebank worship the same God, like Carriere at Nantes, and see\r\nwhat grace and gifts he too might obtain at that altar?\r\n\r\nBut why so cruel?  Because, with many of these men, I more than suspect,\r\nthere were wrongs to be avenged deeper than any wrongs done to the sixth\r\nsense of vanity.  Wrongs common to them, and to a great portion of the\r\nrespectable middle class, and much of the lower class: but wrongs to\r\nwhich they and their families, being most in contact with the noblesse,\r\nwould be especially exposed; namely, wrongs to women.\r\n\r\nEveryone who knows the literature of that time, must know what I mean:\r\nwhat had gone on for more than a century, it may be more than two, in\r\nFrance, in Italy, and--I am sorry to have to say it--Germany likewise.\r\nAll historians know what I mean, and how enormous was the evil.  I only\r\nwonder that they have so much overlooked that item in the causes of the\r\nRevolution.  It seems to me to have been more patent and potent in the\r\nsight of men, as it surely was in the sight of Almighty God, than all the\r\npolitical and economic wrongs put together.  They might have issued in a\r\nchange of dynasty or of laws.  That, issued in the blood of the\r\noffenders.  Not a girl was enticed into Louis XV.'s Petit Trianon, or\r\nother den of aristocratic iniquity, but left behind her, parents nursing\r\nshame and sullen indignation, even while they fingered the ill-gotten\r\nprice of their daughter's honour; and left behind also, perhaps, some\r\nunhappy boy of her own class, in whom disappointment and jealousy were\r\ntransformed--and who will blame him?--into righteous indignation, and a\r\nvery sword of God; all the more indignant, and all the more righteous, if\r\neducation helped him to see, that the maiden's acquiescence, her pride in\r\nher own shame, was the ugliest feature in the whole crime, and the most\r\npotent reason for putting an end, however fearful, to a state of things\r\nin which such a fate was thought an honour and a gain, and not a disgrace\r\nand a ruin; in which the most gifted daughters of the lower classes had\r\nlearnt to think it more noble to become--that which they became--than the\r\nwives of honest men.\r\n\r\nIf you will read fairly the literature of the Ancien Regime, whether in\r\nFrance or elsewhere, you will see that my facts are true.  If you have\r\nhuman hearts in you, you will see in them, it seems to me, an explanation\r\nof many a guillotinade and fusillade, as yet explained only on the ground\r\nof madness--an hypothesis which (as we do not yet in the least understand\r\nwhat madness is) is no explanation at all.\r\n\r\nAn age of decay, incoherence, and makeshift, varnish and gilding upon\r\nworm-eaten furniture, and mouldering wainscot, was that same Ancien\r\nRegime.  And for that very reason a picturesque age; like one of its own\r\nlandscapes.  A picturesque bit of uncultivated mountain, swarming with\r\nthe prince's game; a picturesque old robber schloss above, now in ruins;\r\nand below, perhaps, the picturesque new schloss, with its French\r\nfountains and gardens, French nymphs of marble, and of flesh and blood\r\nlikewise, which the prince has partially paid for, by selling a few\r\nhundred young men to the English to fight the Yankees.  The river, too,\r\nis picturesque, for the old bridge has not been repaired since it was\r\nblown up in the Seven Years' War; and there is but a single lazy barge\r\nfloating down the stream, owing to the tolls and tariffs of his Serene\r\nHighness; the village is picturesque, for the flower of the young men are\r\nat the wars, and the place is tumbling down; and the two old peasants in\r\nthe foreground, with the single goat and the hamper of vine-twigs, are\r\nvery picturesque likewise, for they are all in rags.\r\n\r\nHow sad to see the picturesque element eliminated, and the quiet artistic\r\nbeauty of the scene destroyed;--to have steamers puffing up and down the\r\nriver, and a railroad hurrying along its banks the wealth of the Old\r\nWorld, in exchange for the wealth of the New--or hurrying, it may be,\r\nwhole regiments of free and educated citizen-soldiers, who fight, they\r\nknow for what.  How sad to see the alto schloss desecrated by tourists,\r\nand the neue schloss converted into a cold-water cure.  How sad to see\r\nthe village, church and all, built up again brand-new, and whitewashed to\r\nthe very steeple-top;--a new school at the town-end--a new crucifix by\r\nthe wayside.  How sad to see the old folk well clothed in the fabrics of\r\nEngland or Belgium, doing an easy trade in milk and fruit, because the\r\nland they till has become their own, and not the prince's; while their\r\nsons are thriving farmers on the prairies of the far West.  Very\r\nunpicturesque, no doubt, is wealth and progress, peace and safety,\r\ncleanliness and comfort.  But they possess advantages unknown to the\r\nAncien Regime, which was, if nothing else, picturesque.  Men could paint\r\namusing and often pretty pictures of its people and its places.\r\n\r\nConsider that word, \"picturesque.\"  It, and the notion of art which it\r\nexpresses, are the children of the Ancien Regime--of the era of decay.\r\nThe healthy, vigorous, earnest, progressive Middle Age never dreamed of\r\nadmiring, much less of painting, for their own sake, rags and ruins; the\r\nfashion sprang up at the end of the seventeenth century; it lingered on\r\nduring the first quarter of our century, kept alive by the reaction from\r\n1815-25.  It is all but dead now, before the return of vigorous and\r\nprogressive thought.  An admirer of the Middle Ages now does not build a\r\nsham ruin in his grounds; he restores a church, blazing with colour, like\r\na medieval illumination.  He has learnt to look on that which went by the\r\nname of picturesque in his great-grandfather's time, as an old Greek or a\r\nMiddle Age monk would have done--as something squalid, ugly, a sign of\r\nneglect, disease, death; and therefore to be hated and abolished, if it\r\ncannot be restored.  At Carcassone, now, M. Viollet-le-Duc, under the\r\nauspices of the Emperor of the French, is spending his vast learning, and\r\nmuch money, simply in abolishing the picturesque; in restoring stone for\r\nstone, each member of that wonderful museum of Middle Age architecture:\r\nRoman, Visigothic, Moslem, Romaine, Early English, later French, all is\r\nbeing reproduced exactly as it must have existed centuries since.  No\r\ndoubt that is not the highest function of art: but it is a preparation\r\nfor the highest, a step toward some future creative school.  As the early\r\nItalian artists, by careful imitation, absorbed into their minds the\r\nbeauty and meaning of old Greek and Roman art; so must the artists of our\r\ndays by the art of the Middle Age and the Renaissance.  They must learn\r\nto copy, before they can learn to surpass; and, meanwhile, they must\r\nlearn--indeed they have learnt--that decay is ugliness, and the imitation\r\nof decay, a making money out of the public shame.\r\n\r\nThe picturesque sprang up, as far as I can discover, suddenly, during the\r\ntime of exhaustion and recklessness which followed the great struggles of\r\nthe sixteenth century.  Salvator Rosa and Callot, two of the earliest\r\nprofessors of picturesque art, have never been since surpassed.  For\r\nindeed, they drew from life.  The rags and the ruins, material, and alas!\r\nspiritual, were all around them; the lands and the creeds alike lay\r\nwaste.  There was ruffianism and misery among the masses of Europe;\r\nunbelief and artificiality among the upper classes; churches and\r\nmonasteries defiled, cities sacked, farmsteads plundered and ruinate, and\r\nall the wretchedness which Callot has immortalised--for a warning to evil\r\nrulers--in his Miseres de la Guerre.  The world was all gone wrong: but\r\nas for setting it right again--who could do that?  And so men fell into a\r\nsentimental regret for the past, and its beauties, all exaggerated by the\r\nforeshortening of time; while they wanted strength or faith to reproduce\r\nit.  At last they became so accustomed to the rags and ruins, that they\r\nlooked on them as the normal condition of humanity, as the normal field\r\nfor painters.\r\n\r\nOnly now and then, and especially toward the latter half of the\r\neighteenth century, when thought began to revive, and men dreamed of\r\nputting the world to rights once more, there rose before them glimpses of\r\nan Arcadian ideal.  Country life--the primaeval calling of men--how\r\ngraceful and pure it might be!  How graceful--if not pure--it once had\r\nbeen!  The boors of Teniers and the beggars of Murillo might be true to\r\npresent fact; but there was a fairer ideal, which once had been fact, in\r\nthe Eclogues of Theocritus, and the Loves of Daphnis and Chloe.  And so\r\nmen took to dreaming of shepherds and shepherdesses, and painting them on\r\ncanvas, and modelling them in china, according to their cockney notions\r\nof what they had been once, and always ought to be.  We smile now at\r\nSevres and Dresden shepherdesses; but the wise man will surely see in\r\nthem a certain pathos.  They indicated a craving after something better\r\nthan boorishness; and the many men and women may have become the gentler\r\nand purer by looking even at them, and have said sadly to themselves:\r\n\"Such might have been the peasantry of half Europe, had it not been for\r\ndevastations of the Palatinate, wars of succession, and the wicked wills\r\nof emperors and kings.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE III--THE EXPLOSIVE FORCES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a former lecture in this Institution, I said that the human race owed\r\nmore to the eighteenth century than to any century since the Christian\r\nera.  It may seem a bold assertion to those who value duly the century\r\nwhich followed the revival of Greek literature, and consider that the\r\neighteenth century was but the child, or rather grandchild, thereof.  But\r\nI must persist in my opinion, even though it seem to be inconsistent with\r\nmy description of the very same era as one of decay and death.  For side\r\nby side with the death, there was manifold fresh birth; side by side with\r\nthe decay there was active growth;--side by side with them, fostered by\r\nthem, though generally in strong opposition to them, whether conscious or\r\nunconscious.  We must beware, however, of trying to find between that\r\ndecay and that growth a bond of cause and effect where there is really\r\nnone.  The general decay may have determined the course of many men's\r\nthoughts; but it no more set them thinking than (as I have heard said)\r\nthe decay of the Ancien Regime produced the new Regime--a loose metaphor,\r\nwhich, like all metaphors, will not hold water, and must not be taken for\r\na philosophic truth.  That would be to confess man--what I shall never\r\nconfess him to be--the creature of circumstances; it would be to fall\r\ninto the same fallacy of spontaneous generation as did the ancients, when\r\nthey believed that bees were bred from the carcass of a dead ox.  In the\r\nfirst place, the bees were no bees, but flies--unless when some true\r\nswarm of honey bees may have taken up their abode within the empty ribs,\r\nas Samson's bees did in that of the lion.  But bees or flies, each sprang\r\nfrom an egg, independent of the carcass, having a vitality of its own: it\r\nwas fostered by the carcass it fed on during development; but bred from\r\nit it was not, any more than Marat was bred from the decay of the Ancien\r\nRegime.  There are flies which, by feeding on putridity, become poisonous\r\nthemselves, as did Marat: but even they owe their vitality and\r\norganisation to something higher than that on which they feed; and each\r\nof them, however, defaced and debased, was at first a \"thought of God.\"\r\nAll true manhood consists in the defiance of circumstances; and if any\r\nman be the creature of circumstances, it is because he has become so,\r\nlike the drunkard; because he has ceased to be a man, and sunk downward\r\ntoward the brute.\r\n\r\nAccordingly we shall find, throughout the 18th century, a stirring of\r\nthought, an originality, a resistance to circumstances, an indignant\r\ndefiance of circumstances, which would have been impossible, had\r\ncircumstances been the true lords and shapers of mankind.  Had that\r\nlatter been the case, the downward progress of the Ancien Regime would\r\nhave been irremediable.  Each generation, conformed more and more to the\r\nelement in which it lived, would have sunk deeper in dull acquiescence to\r\nevil, in ignorance of all cravings save those of the senses; and if at\r\nany time intolerable wrong or want had driven it to revolt, it would have\r\nissued, not in the proclamation of new and vast ideas, but in an anarchic\r\nstruggle for revenge and bread.\r\n\r\nThere are races, alas! which seem, for the present at least, mastered by\r\ncircumstances.  Some, like the Chinese, have sunk back into that state;\r\nsome, like the negro in Africa, seem not yet to have emerged from it; but\r\nin Europe, during the eighteenth century, were working not merely new\r\nforces and vitalities (abstractions which mislead rather than explain),\r\nbut living persons in plenty, men and women, with independent and\r\noriginal hearts and brains, instinct, in spite of all circumstances, with\r\npower which we shall most wisely ascribe directly to Him who is the Lord\r\nand Giver of Life.\r\n\r\nSuch persons seemed--I only say seemed--most numerous in England and in\r\nGermany.  But there were enough of them in France to change the destiny\r\nof that great nation for awhile--perhaps for ever.\r\n\r\nM. de Tocqueville has a whole chapter, and a very remarkable one, which\r\nappears at first sight to militate against my belief--a chapter \"showing\r\nthat France was the country in which men had become most alike.\"\r\n\r\n\"The men,\" he says, \"of that time, especially those belonging to the\r\nupper and middle ranks of society, who alone were at all conspicuous,\r\nwere all exactly alike.\"\r\n\r\nAnd it must be allowed, that if this were true of the upper and middle\r\nclasses, it must have been still more true of the mass of the lowest\r\npopulation, who, being most animal, are always most moulded--or rather\r\ncrushed--by their own circumstances, by public opinion, and by the wants\r\nof five senses, common to all alike.\r\n\r\nBut when M. de Tocqueville attributes this curious fact to the\r\ncircumstances of their political state--to that \"government of one man\r\nwhich in the end has the inevitable effect of rendering all men alike,\r\nand all mutually indifferent to their common fate\"--we must differ, even\r\nfrom him: for facts prove the impotence of that, or of any other\r\ncircumstance, in altering the hearts and souls of men, in producing in\r\nthem anything but a mere superficial and temporary resemblance.\r\n\r\nFor all the while there was, among these very French, here and there a\r\nvariety of character and purpose, sufficient to burst through that very\r\ndespotism, and to develop the nation into manifold, new, and quite\r\noriginal shapes.  Thus it was proved that the uniformity had been only in\r\ntheir outside crust and shell.  What tore the nation to pieces during the\r\nReign of Terror, but the boundless variety and originality of the\r\ncharacters which found themselves suddenly in free rivalry?  What else\r\ngave to the undisciplined levies, the bankrupt governments, the parvenu\r\nheroes of the Republic, a manifold force, a self-dependent audacity,\r\nwhich made them the conquerors, and the teachers (for good and evil) of\r\nthe civilised world?  If there was one doctrine which the French\r\nRevolution specially proclaimed--which it caricatured till it brought it\r\ninto temporary disrepute--it was this: that no man is like another; that\r\nin each is a God-given \"individuality,\" an independent soul, which no\r\ngovernment or man has a right to crush, or can crush in the long run: but\r\nwhich ought to have, and must have, a \"carriere ouverte aux talents,\"\r\nfreely to do the best for itself in the battle of life.  The French\r\nRevolution, more than any event since twelve poor men set forth to\r\nconvert the world some eighteen hundred years ago, proves that man ought\r\nnot to be, and need not be, the creature of circumstances, the puppet of\r\ninstitutions; but, if he will, their conqueror and their lord.\r\n\r\nOf these original spirits who helped to bring life out of death, and the\r\nmodern world out of the decay of the mediaeval world, the French\r\n_philosophes_ and encyclopaedists are, of course, the most notorious.\r\nThey confessed, for the most part, that their original inspiration had\r\ncome from England.  They were, or considered themselves, the disciples of\r\nLocke; whose philosophy, it seems to me, their own acts disproved.\r\n\r\nAnd first, a few words on these same _philosophes_.  One may be\r\nthoroughly aware of their deficiencies, of their sins, moral as well as\r\nintellectual; and yet one may demand that everyone should judge them\r\nfairly--which can only be done by putting himself in their place; and any\r\nfair judgment of them will, I think, lead to the conclusion that they\r\nwere not mere destroyers, inflamed with hate of everything which mankind\r\nhad as yet held sacred.  Whatever sacred things they despised, one sacred\r\nthing they reverenced, which men had forgotten more and more since the\r\nseventeenth century--common justice and common humanity.  It was this, I\r\nbelieve, which gave them their moral force.  It was this which drew\r\ntowards them the hearts, not merely of educated bourgeois and nobles (on\r\nthe _menu peuple_ they had no influence, and did not care to have any),\r\nbut of every continental sovereign who felt in himself higher aspirations\r\nthan those of a mere selfish tyrant--Frederick the Great, Christina of\r\nSweden, Joseph of Austria, and even that fallen Juno, Catharine of\r\nRussia, with all her sins.  To take the most extreme instance--Voltaire.\r\nWe may question his being a philosopher at all.  We may deny that he had\r\neven a tincture of formal philosophy.  We may doubt much whether he had\r\nany of that human and humorous common sense, which is often a good\r\nsubstitute for the philosophy of the schools.  We may feel against him a\r\njust and honest indignation when we remember that he dared to travestie\r\ninto a foul satire the tale of his country's purest and noblest heroine;\r\nbut we must recollect, at the same time, that he did a public service to\r\nthe morality of his own country, and of all Europe, by his\r\nindignation--quite as just and honest as any which we may feel--at the\r\nlegal murder of Calas.  We must recollect that, if he exposes baseness\r\nand foulness with too cynical a license of speech (in which, indeed, he\r\nsinned no more than had the average of French writers since the days of\r\nMontaigne), he at least never advocates them, as did Le Sage.  We must\r\nrecollect that, scattered throughout his writings, are words in favour of\r\nthat which is just, merciful, magnanimous, and even, at times, in favour\r\nof that which is pure; which proves that in Voltaire, as in most men,\r\nthere was a double self--the one sickened to cynicism by the iniquity and\r\nfolly which he saw around him--the other, hungering after a nobler life,\r\nand possibly exciting that hunger in one and another, here and there, who\r\nadmired him for other reasons than the educated mob, which cried after\r\nhim \"Vive la Pucelle.\"\r\n\r\nRousseau, too.  Easy it is to feel disgust, contempt, for the\r\n\"Confessions\" and the \"Nouvelle Heloise\"--for much, too much, in the\r\nman's own life and character.  One would think the worse of the young\r\nEnglishman who did not so feel, and express his feelings roundly and\r\nroughly.  But all young Englishmen should recollect, that to Rousseau's\r\n\"Emile\" they owe their deliverance from the useless pedantries, the\r\ndegrading brutalities, of the medieval system of school education; that\r\n\"Emile\" awakened throughout civilised Europe a conception of education\r\njust, humane, rational, truly scientific, because founded upon facts;\r\nthat if it had not been written by one writhing under the bitter\r\nconsequences of mis-education, and feeling their sting and their brand\r\nday by day on his own spirit, Miss Edgeworth might never have reformed\r\nour nurseries, or Dr. Arnold our public schools.\r\n\r\nAnd so with the rest of the _philosophes_.  That there were charlatans\r\namong them, vain men, pretentious men, profligate men, selfish,\r\nself-seeking, and hypocritical men, who doubts?  Among what class of men\r\nwere there not such in those evil days?  In what class of men are there\r\nnot such now, in spite of all social and moral improvement?  But nothing\r\nbut the conviction, among the average, that they were in the right--that\r\nthey were fighting a battle for which it was worth while to dare, and if\r\nneed be to suffer, could have enabled them to defy what was then public\r\nopinion, backed by overwhelming physical force.\r\n\r\nTheir intellectual defects are patent.  No one can deny that their\r\ninductions were hasty and partial: but then they were inductions as\r\nopposed to the dull pedantry of the schools, which rested on tradition\r\nonly half believed, or pretended to be believed.  No one can deny that\r\ntheir theories were too general and abstract; but then they were theories\r\nas opposed to the no-theory of the Ancien Regime, which was, \"Let us eat\r\nand drink, for to-morrow we die.\"\r\n\r\nTheories--principles--by them if men do not live, by them men are, at\r\nleast, stirred into life, at the sight of something more noble than\r\nthemselves.  Only by great ideas, right or wrong, could such a world as\r\nthat which Le Sage painted, be roused out of its slough of foul\r\nself-satisfaction, and equally foul self-discontent.\r\n\r\nFor mankind is ruled and guided, in the long run, not by practical\r\nconsiderations, not by self-interest, not by compromises; but by theories\r\nand principles, and those of the most abstruse, delicate, supernatural,\r\nand literally unspeakable kind; which, whether they be according to\r\nreason or not, are so little according to logic--that is, to speakable\r\nreason--that they cannot be put into speech.  Men act, whether singly or\r\nin masses, by impulses and instincts for which they give reasons quite\r\nincompetent, often quite irrelevant; but which they have caught from each\r\nother, as they catch fever or small-pox; as unconsciously, and yet as\r\npractically and potently; just as the nineteenth century has caught from\r\nthe philosophers of the eighteenth most practical rules of conduct,\r\nwithout even (in most cases) having read a word of their works.\r\n\r\nAnd what has this century caught from these philosophers?  One rule it\r\nhas learnt, and that a most practical one--to appeal in all cases, as\r\nmuch as possible, to \"Reason and the Laws of Nature.\"  That, at least,\r\nthe philosophers tried to do.  Often they failed.  Their conceptions of\r\nreason and of the laws of nature being often incorrect, they appealed to\r\nunreason and to laws which were not those of nature.  \"The fixed idea of\r\nthem all was,\" says M. de Tocqueville, \"to substitute simple and\r\nelementary rules, deduced from reason and natural law, for the\r\ncomplicated traditional customs which governed the society of their\r\ntime.\"  They were often rash, hasty, in the application of their method.\r\nThey ignored whole classes of facts, which, though spiritual and not\r\nphysical, are just as much facts, and facts for science, as those which\r\nconcern a stone or a fungus.  They mistook for merely complicated\r\ntraditional customs, many most sacred institutions which were just as\r\nmuch founded on reason and natural law, as any theories of their own.  But\r\nwho shall say that their method was not correct?  That it was not the\r\nonly method?  They appealed to reason.  Would you have had them appeal to\r\nunreason?  They appealed to natural law.  Would you have had them appeal\r\nto unnatural law?--law according to which God did not make this world?\r\nAlas! that had been done too often already.  Solomon saw it done in his\r\ntime, and called it folly, to which he prophesied no good end.  Rabelais\r\nsaw it done in his time; and wrote his chapters on the \"Children of\r\nPhysis and the Children of Antiphysis.\"  But, born in an evil generation,\r\nwhich was already, even in 1500, ripening for the revolution of 1789, he\r\nwas sensual and, I fear, cowardly enough to hide his light, not under a\r\nbushel, but under a dunghill; till men took him for a jester of jests;\r\nand his great wisdom was lost to the worse and more foolish generations\r\nwhich followed him, and thought they understood him.\r\n\r\nBut as for appealing to natural law for that which is good for men, and\r\nto reason for the power of discerning that same good--if man cannot find\r\ntruth by that method, by what method shall he find it?\r\n\r\nAnd thus it happened that, though these philosophers and encyclopaedists\r\nwere not men of science, they were at least the heralds and the\r\ncoadjutors of science.\r\n\r\nWe may call them, and justly, dreamers, theorists, fanatics.  But we must\r\nrecollect that one thing they meant to do, and did.  They recalled men to\r\nfacts; they bid them ask of everything they saw--What are the facts of\r\nthe case?  Till we know the facts, argument is worse than useless.\r\n\r\nNow the habit of asking for the facts of the case must deliver men more\r\nor less from that evil spirit which the old Romans called \"Fama;\" from\r\nher whom Virgil described in the AEneid as the ugliest, the falsest, and\r\nthe cruellest of monsters.\r\n\r\nFrom \"Fama;\" from rumours, hearsays, exaggerations, scandals,\r\nsuperstitions, public opinions--whether from the ancient public opinion\r\nthat the sun went round the earth, or the equally public opinion, that\r\nthose who dared to differ from public opinion were hateful to the deity,\r\nand therefore worthy of death--from all these blasts of Fame's lying\r\ntrumpet they helped to deliver men; and they therefore helped to insure\r\nsomething like peace and personal security for those quiet, modest, and\r\ngenerally virtuous men, who, as students of physical science, devoted\r\ntheir lives, during the eighteenth century, to asking of nature--What are\r\nthe facts of the case?\r\n\r\nIt was no coincidence, but a connection of cause and effect, that during\r\nthe century of _philosopher_ sound physical science throve, as she had\r\nnever thriven before; that in zoology and botany, chemistry and medicine,\r\ngeology and astronomy, man after man, both of the middle and the noble\r\nclasses, laid down on more and more sound, because more and more extended\r\nfoundations, that physical science which will endure as an everlasting\r\nheritage to mankind; endure, even though a second Byzantine period should\r\nreduce it to a timid and traditional pedantry, or a second irruption of\r\nbarbarians sweep it away for awhile, to revive again (as classic\r\nphilosophy revived in the fifteenth century) among new and more energetic\r\nraces; when the kingdom of God shall have been taken away from us, and\r\ngiven to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.\r\n\r\nAn eternal heritage, I say, for the human race; which once gained, can\r\nnever be lost; which stands, and will stand; marches, and will march,\r\nproving its growth, its health, its progressive force, its certainty of\r\nfinal victory, by those very changes, disputes, mistakes, which the\r\nignorant and the bigoted hold up to scorn, as proofs of its uncertainty\r\nand its rottenness; because they never have dared or cared to ask\r\nboldly--What are the facts of the case?--and have never discovered either\r\nthe acuteness, the patience, the calm justice, necessary for ascertaining\r\nthe facts, or their awful and divine certainty when once ascertained.\r\n\r\n[But these philosophers (it will be said) hated all religion.\r\n\r\nBefore that question can be fairly discussed, it is surely right to\r\nconsider what form of religion that was which they found working round\r\nthem in France, and on the greater part of the Continent.  The quality\r\nthereof may have surely had something to do (as they themselves asserted)\r\nwith that \"sort of rage\" with which (to use M. de Tocqueville's words)\r\n\"the Christian religion was attacked in France.\"\r\n\r\nM. de Tocqueville is of opinion (and his opinion is likely to be just)\r\nthat \"the Church was not more open to attack in France than elsewhere;\r\nthat the corruptions and abuses which had been allowed to creep into it\r\nwere less, on the contrary, there than in most Catholic countries.  The\r\nChurch of France was infinitely more tolerant than it ever had been\r\npreviously, and than it still was among other nations.  Consequently, the\r\npeculiar causes of this phenomenon\" (the hatred which it aroused) \"must\r\nbe looked for less in the condition of religion than in that of society.\"\r\n\r\n\"We no longer,\" he says, shortly after, \"ask in what the Church of that\r\nday erred as a religious institution, but how far it stood opposed to the\r\npolitical revolution which was at hand.\"  And he goes on to show how the\r\nprinciples of her ecclesiastical government, and her political position,\r\nwere such that the _philosophes_ must needs have been her enemies.  But\r\nhe mentions another fact which seems to me to belong neither to the\r\ncategory of religion nor to that of politics; a fact which, if he had\r\ndone us the honour to enlarge upon it, might have led him and his readers\r\nto a more true understanding of the disrepute into which Christianity had\r\nfallen in France.\r\n\r\n\"The ecclesiastical authority had been specially employed in keeping\r\nwatch over the progress of thought; and the censorship of books was a\r\ndaily annoyance to the _philosophes_.  By defending the common liberties\r\nof the human mind against the Church, they were combating in their own\r\ncause: and they began by breaking the shackles which pressed most closely\r\non themselves.\"\r\n\r\nJust so.  And they are not to be blamed if they pressed first and most\r\nearnestly reforms which they knew by painful experience to be necessary.\r\nAll reformers are wont thus to begin at home.  It is to their honour if,\r\nnot content with shaking off their own fetters, they begin to see that\r\nothers are fettered likewise; and, reasoning from the particular to the\r\nuniversal, to learn that their own cause is the cause of mankind.\r\n\r\nThere is, therefore, no reason to doubt that these men were honest, when\r\nthey said that they were combating, not in their own cause merely, but in\r\nthat of humanity; and that the Church was combating in her own cause, and\r\nthat of her power and privilege.  The Church replied that she, too, was\r\ncombating for humanity; for its moral and eternal well-being.  But that\r\nis just what the _philosophes_ denied.  They said (and it is but fair to\r\ntake a statement which appears on the face of all their writings; which\r\nis the one key-note on which they ring perpetual changes), that the cause\r\nof the Church in France was not that of humanity, but of inhumanity; not\r\nthat of nature, but of unnature; not even that of grace, but of disgrace.\r\nTruely or falsely, they complained that the French clergy had not only\r\nidentified themselves with the repression of free thought, and of\r\nphysical science, especially that of the Newtonian astronomy, but that\r\nthey had proved themselves utterly unfit, for centuries past, to exercise\r\nany censorship whatsoever over the thoughts of men: that they had\r\nidentified themselves with the cause of darkness, not of light; with\r\npersecution and torture, with the dragonnades of Louis XIV., with the\r\nmurder of Calas and of Urban Grandier; with celibacy, hysteria,\r\ndemonology, witchcraft, and the shameful public scandals, like those of\r\nGauffredi, Grandier, and Pere Giraud, which had arisen out of mental\r\ndisease; with forms of worship which seemed to them (rightly or wrongly)\r\nidolatry, and miracles which seemed to them (rightly or wrongly)\r\nimpostures; that the clergy interfered perpetually with the sanctity of\r\nfamily life, as well as with the welfare of the state; that their evil\r\ncounsels, and specially those of the Jesuits, had been patent and potent\r\ncauses of much of the misrule and misery of Louis XIV.'s and XV.'s\r\nreigns; and that with all these heavy counts against them, their morality\r\nwas not such as to make other men more moral; and was not--at least among\r\nthe hierarchy--improving, or likely to improve.  To a Mazarin, a De Retz,\r\na Richelieu (questionable men enough) had succeeded a Dubois, a Rohan, a\r\nLomenie de Brienne, a Maury, a Talleyrand; and at the revolution of 1789\r\nthoughtful Frenchmen asked, once and for all, what was to be done with a\r\nChurch of which these were the hierophants?\r\n\r\nWhether these complaints affected the French Church as a \"religious\"\r\ninstitution, must depend entirely on the meaning which is attached to the\r\nword \"religion\": that they affected her on scientific, rational, and\r\nmoral grounds, independent of any merely political one, is as patent as\r\nthat the attack based on them was one-sided, virulent, and often somewhat\r\nhypocritical, considering the private morals of many of the assailants.\r\nWe know--or ought to know--that within that religion which seemed to the\r\n_philosophes_ (so distorted and defaced had it become) a nightmare dream,\r\ncrushing the life out of mankind, there lie elements divine, eternal;\r\nnecessary for man in this life and the life to come.  But we are bound to\r\nask--Had they a fair chance of knowing what we know?  Have we proof that\r\ntheir hatred was against all religion, or only against that which they\r\nsaw around them?  Have we proof that they would have equally hated, had\r\nthey been in permanent contact with them, creeds more free from certain\r\nfaults which seemed to them, in the case of the French Church,\r\nineradicable and inexpiable?  Till then we must have charity--which is\r\njustice--even for the _philosophes_ of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nThis view of the case had been surely overlooked by M. de Tocqueville,\r\nwhen he tried to explain by the fear of revolutions, the fact that both\r\nin America and in England, \"while the boldest political doctrines of the\r\neighteenth-century philosophers have been adopted, their anti-religious\r\ndoctrines have made no way.\"\r\n\r\nHe confesses that, \"Among the English, French irreligious philosophy had\r\nbeen preached, even before the greater part of the French philosophers\r\nwere born.  It was Bolingbroke who set up Voltaire.  Throughout the\r\neighteenth century infidelity had celebrated champions in England.  Able\r\nwriters and profound thinkers espoused that cause, but they were never\r\nable to render it triumphant as in France.\"  Of these facts there can be\r\nno doubt: but the cause which he gives for the failure of infidelity will\r\nsurely sound new and strange to those who know the English literature and\r\nhistory of that century.  It was, he says, \"inasmuch as all those who had\r\nanything to fear from revolutions, eagerly came to the rescue of the\r\nestablished faith.\"  Surely there was no talk of revolutions; no wish,\r\nexpressed or concealed, to overthrow either government or society, in the\r\naristocratic clique to whom English infidelity was confined.  Such was,\r\nat least, the opinion of Voltaire, who boasted that \"All the works of the\r\nmodern philosophers together would never make as much noise in the world\r\nas was made in former days by the disputes of the Cordeliers about the\r\nshape of their sleeves and hoods.\"  If (as M. de Tocqueville says)\r\nBolingbroke set up Voltaire, neither master nor pupil had any more\r\nleaning than Hobbes had toward a democracy which was not dreaded in those\r\ndays because it had never been heard of.  And if (as M. de Tocqueville\r\nheartily allows) the English apologists of Christianity triumphed, at\r\nleast for the time being, the cause of their triumph must be sought in\r\nthe plain fact that such men as Berkeley, Butler, and Paley, each\r\naccording to his light, fought the battle fairly, on the common ground of\r\nreason and philosophy, instead of on that of tradition and authority; and\r\nthat the forms of Christianity current in England--whether Quaker,\r\nPuritan, or Anglican--offended, less than that current in France, the\r\ncommon-sense and the human instincts of the many, or of the sceptics\r\nthemselves.]\r\n\r\nBut the eighteenth century saw another movement, all the more powerful,\r\nperhaps, because it was continually changing its shape, even its purpose;\r\nand gaining fresh life and fresh adherents with every change.  Propagated\r\nat first by men of the school of Locke, it became at last a protest\r\nagainst the materialism of that school, on behalf of all that is, or\r\ncalls itself, supernatural and mysterious.  Abjuring, and honestly, all\r\npolitics, it found itself sucked into the political whirlpool in spite of\r\nitself, as all human interests which have any life in them must be at\r\nlast.  It became an active promoter of the Revolution; then it helped to\r\ndestroy the Revolution, when that had, under Napoleon, become a levelling\r\ndespotism; then it helped, as actively, to keep revolutionary principles\r\nalive, after the reaction of 1815:--a Protean institution, whose power we\r\nin England are as apt to undervalue as the governments of the Continent\r\nwere apt, during the eighteenth century, to exaggerate it.  I mean, of\r\ncourse, Freemasonry, and the secret societies which, honestly and\r\nhonourably disowned by Freemasonry, yet have either copied it, or\r\nactually sprung out of it.  In England, Freemasonry never was, it seems,\r\nmore than a liberal and respectable benefit-club; for secret societies\r\nare needless for any further purposes, amid free institutions and a free\r\npress.  But on the Continent during the eighteenth century, Freemasonry\r\nexcited profound suspicion and fear on the part of statesmen who knew\r\nperfectly well their friends from their foes; and whose precautions were,\r\nfrom their point of view, justified by the results.\r\n\r\nI shall not enter into the deep question of the origin of Freemasonry.\r\nOne uninitiate, as I am, has no right to give an opinion on the great\r\nquestions of the mediaeval lodge of Kilwinning and its Scotch degrees; on\r\nthe seven Templars, who, after poor Jacques Molay was burnt at Paris,\r\ntook refuge on the Isle of Mull, in Scotland, found there another Templar\r\nand brother Mason, ominously named Harris; took to the trowel in earnest,\r\nand revived the Order;--on the Masons who built Magdeburg Cathedral in\r\n876; on the English Masons assembled in Pagan times by \"St. Albone, that\r\nworthy knight;\" on the revival of English Masonry by Edwin, son of\r\nAthelstan; on Magnus Grecus, who had been at the building of Solomon's\r\nTemple, and taught Masonry to Charles Martel; on the pillars Jachin and\r\nBoaz; on the masonry of Hiram of Tyre, and indeed of Adam himself, of\r\nwhose first fig-leaf the masonic apron may be a type--on all these\r\nmatters I dare no more decide than on the making of the Trojan Horse, the\r\nbirth of Romulus and Remus, or the incarnation of Vishnoo.\r\n\r\nAll I dare say is, that Freemasonry emerges in its present form into\r\nhistory and fact, seemingly about the beginning of George I.'s reign,\r\namong Englishmen and noblemen, notably in four lodges in the city of\r\nLondon: (1) at The Goose and Gridiron alehouse in St. Paul's Churchyard;\r\n(2) at The Crown alehouse near Drury Lane; (3) at The Apple Tree tavern\r\nnear Covent Garden; (4) at The Rummer and Grapes tavern, in Charnel Row,\r\nWestminster.  That its principles were brotherly love and good\r\nfellowship, which included in those days port, sherry, claret, and punch;\r\nthat it was founded on the ground of mere humanity, in every sense of the\r\nword; being (as was to be expected from the temper of the times) both\r\naristocratic and liberal, admitting to its ranks virtuous gentlemen\r\n\"obliged,\" says an old charge, \"only to that religion wherein all men\r\nagree, leaving their particular opinions to themselves: that is, to be\r\ngood men and true, or men of honour and honesty, by whatever\r\ndenominations or persuasions they may be distinguished; whereby Masonry\r\nbecomes the centre of union and means of conciliating true friendship\r\namong persons that otherwise must have remained at a distance.\"\r\n\r\nLittle did the honest gentlemen who established or re-established their\r\nsociety on these grounds, and fenced it with quaint ceremonies, old or\r\nnew, conceive the importance of their own act; we, looking at it from a\r\ndistance, may see all that such a society involved, which was quite new\r\nto the world just then; and see, that it was the very child of the Ancien\r\nRegime--of a time when men were growing weary of the violent factions,\r\npolitical and spiritual, which had torn Europe in pieces for more than a\r\ncentury, and longed to say: \"After all, we are all alike in one thing--for\r\nwe are at least men.\"\r\n\r\nIts spread through England and Scotland, and the seceding bodies which\r\narose from it, as well as the supposed Jacobite tendency of certain\r\nScotch lodges, do not concern us here.  The point interesting to us just\r\nnow is, that Freemasonry was imported to the Continent exclusively by\r\nEnglish and Scotch gentlemen and noblemen.  Lord Derwentwater is said by\r\nsome to have founded the \"Loge Anglaise\" in Paris in 1725; the Duke of\r\nRichmond one in his own castle of Aubigny shortly after.  It was through\r\nHanoverian influence that the movement seems to have spread into Germany.\r\nIn 1733, for instance, the English Grand Master, Lord Strathmore,\r\npermitted eleven German gentlemen and good brethren to form a lodge in\r\nHamburg.  Into this English Society was Frederick the Great, when Crown\r\nPrince, initiated, in spite of strict old Frederick William's objections,\r\nwho had heard of it as an English invention of irreligious tendency.\r\nFrancis I. of Austria was made a Freemason at the Hague, Lord\r\nChesterfield being in the chair, and then became a Master in London under\r\nthe name of \"Brother Lothringen,\" to the discontent of Maria Theresa,\r\nwhose woman's wit saw farther than her husband.  Englishmen and Scotchmen\r\nintroduced the new society into Russia and into Geneva.  Sweden and\r\nPoland seem to have received it from France; while, in the South, it\r\nseems to have been exclusively an English plant.  Sackville, Duke of\r\nMiddlesex, is said to have founded the first lodge at Florence in 1733,\r\nLord Coleraine at Gibraltar and Madrid, one Gordon in Portugal; and\r\neverywhere, at the commencement of the movement, we find either London or\r\nScotland the mother-lodges, introducing on the Continent those liberal\r\nand humane ideas of which England was then considered, to her glory, as\r\nthe only home left on earth.\r\n\r\nBut, alas! the seed sown grew up into strange shapes, according to the\r\nsoil in which it rooted.  False doctrine, heresy, and schism, according\r\nto Herr Findel, the learned and rational historian whom I have chiefly\r\nfollowed, defiled the new Church from its infancy.  \"In France,\" so he\r\nbemoans himself, \"first of all there shot up that baneful seed of lies\r\nand frauds, of vanity and presumption, of hatred and discord, the\r\nmischievous high degrees; the misstatement that our order was allied to\r\nthe Templars, and existed at the time of the Crusades; the removal of old\r\ncharges, the bringing in surreptitiously of a multitude of symbols and\r\nforms which awoke the love of secrecy; knighthood; and, in fact, all\r\nwhich tended to poison Freemasonry.\"  Herr Findel seems to attribute\r\nthese evils principally to the \"high degrees.\"  It would have been more\r\nsimple to have attributed them to the morals of the French noblesse in\r\nthe days of Louis Quinze.  What could a corrupt tree bring forth, but\r\ncorrupt fruit?  If some of the early lodges, like those of \"La Felicite\"\r\nand \"L'Ancre,\" to which women were admitted, resembled not a little the\r\nBacchic mysteries of old Rome, and like them called for the interference\r\nof the police, still no great reform was to be expected, when those\r\nSovereign Masonic Princes, the \"Emperors of the East and West,\"\r\nquarrelled--knights of the East against knights of the West--till they\r\nwere absorbed or crushed by the Lodge \"Grand Orient,\" with Philippe\r\nEgalite, Duc de Chartres, as their grand master, and as his\r\nrepresentative, the hero of the diamond necklace, and disciple of Count\r\nCagliostro--Louis, Prince de Rohan.\r\n\r\nBut if Freemasonry, among the frivolous and sensual French noblesse,\r\nbecame utterly frivolous and sensual itself, it took a deeper, though a\r\nquestionably fantastic form, among the more serious and earnest German\r\nnobility.  Forgetful as they too often were of their duty to their\r\npeoples--tyrannical, extravagant, debauched by French opinions, French\r\nfashions, French luxuries, till they had begun to despise their native\r\nspeech, their native literature, almost their native land, and to hide\r\ntheir native homeliness under a clumsy varnish of French outside\r\ncivilisation, which the years 1807-13 rubbed off them again with a brush\r\nof iron--they were yet Germans at heart; and that German instinct for the\r\nunseen--call it enthusiasm, mysticism, what you will, you cannot make it\r\nanything but a human fact, and a most powerful, and (as I hold) most\r\nblessed fact--that instinct for the unseen, I say, which gives peculiar\r\nvalue to German philosophy, poetry, art, religion, and above all to\r\nGerman family life, and which is just the complement needed to prevent\r\nour English common-sense, matter-of-fact Lockism from degenerating into\r\nmaterialism--that was only lying hidden, but not dead, in the German\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nWith the Germans, therefore, Freemasonry assumed a nobler and more\r\nearnest shape.  Dropping, very soon, that Lockite and _Philosophe_ tone\r\nwhich had perhaps recommended it to Frederick the Great in his youth, it\r\nbecame mediaevalist and mystic.  It craved after a resuscitation of old\r\nchivalrous spirit, and the virtues of the knightly ideal, and the old\r\nGerman _biederkeit und tapferkeit_, which were all defiled and overlaid\r\nby French fopperies.  And not in vain; as no struggle after a noble aim,\r\nhowever confused or fantastic, is ever in vain.  Freemasonry was the\r\ndirect parent of the Tugenbund, and of those secret societies which freed\r\nGermany from Napoleon.  Whatever follies young members of them may have\r\ncommitted; whatever Jahn and his Turnerei; whatever the iron youths, with\r\ntheir iron decorations and iron boot-heels; whatever, in a word, may have\r\nbeen said or done amiss, in that childishness which (as their own wisest\r\nwriters often lament) so often defaces the noble childlikeness of the\r\nGerman spirit, let it be always remembered that under the impulse first\r\ngiven by Freemasonry, as much as that given by such heroes as Stein and\r\nScharnhorst, Germany shook off the chains which had fallen on her in her\r\nsleep; and stood once more at Leipsic, were it but for a moment, a free\r\npeople alike in body and in soul.\r\n\r\nRemembering this, and the solid benefits which Germany owed to Masonic\r\ninfluences, one shrinks from saying much of the extravagances in which\r\nits Masonry indulged before the French Revolution.  Yet they are so\r\ncharacteristic of the age, so significant to the student of human nature,\r\nthat they must be hinted at, though not detailed.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that Masonry was at first a movement confined to the\r\naristocracy, or at least to the most educated classes; and clear, too,\r\nthat it fell in with a temper of mind unsatisfied with the dry dogmatism\r\ninto which the popular creeds had then been frozen--unsatisfied with\r\ntheir own Frenchified foppery and pseudo-philosophy--unsatisfied with\r\nwant of all duty, purpose, noble thought, or noble work.  With such a\r\ntemper of mind it fell in: but that very temper was open (as it always\r\nis) to those dreams of a royal road to wisdom and to virtue, which have\r\nhaunted, in all ages, the luxurious and the idle.\r\n\r\nThose who will, may read enough, and too much, of the wonderful secrets\r\nin nature and science and theosophy, which men expected to find and did\r\nnot find in the higher degrees of Masonry, till old Voss--the translator\r\nof Homer--had to confess, that after \"trying for eleven years to attain a\r\nperfect knowledge of the inmost penetralia, where the secret is said to\r\nbe, and of its invisible guardians,\" all he knew was that \"the documents\r\nwhich he had to make known to the initiated were nothing more than a well\r\ngot-up farce.\"\r\n\r\nBut the mania was general.  The high-born and the virtuous expected to\r\ndiscover some panacea for their own consciences in what Voss calls, \"A\r\nmultitude of symbols, which are ever increasing the farther you\r\npenetrate, and are made to have a moral application through some\r\narbitrary twisting of their meaning, as if I were to attempt expounding\r\nthe chaos on my writing-desk.\"\r\n\r\nA rich harvest-field was an aristocracy in such a humour, for quacks of\r\nevery kind; richer even than that of France, in that the Germans were at\r\nonce more honest and more earnest, and therefore to be robbed more\r\neasily.  The carcass was there: and the birds of prey were gathered\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nOf Rosa, with his lodge of the Three Hammers, and his Potsdam\r\ngold-making;--of Johnson, alias Leuchte, who passed himself off as a\r\nGrand Prior sent from Scotland to resuscitate the order of Knights\r\nTemplars; who informed his disciples that the Grand Master Von Hund\r\ncommanded 26,000 men; that round the convent (what convent, does not\r\nappear) a high wall was erected, which was guarded day and night; that\r\nthe English navy was in the hands of the Order; that they had MSS.\r\nwritten by Hugo de Paganis (a mythic hero who often figures in these\r\nfables); that their treasure was in only three places in the world, in\r\nBallenstadt, in the icy mountains of Savoy, and in China; that whosoever\r\ndrew on himself the displeasure of the Order, perished both body and\r\nsoul; who degraded his rival Rosa to the sound of military music, and\r\nafter having had, like every dog, his day, died in prison in the\r\nWartburg;--of the Rosicrucians, who were accused of wanting to support\r\nand advance the Catholic religion--one would think the accusation was\r\nvery unnecessary, seeing that their actual dealings were with the\r\nphilosopher's stone, and the exorcism of spirits: and that the first\r\napostle of the new golden Rosicrucian order, one Schropfer, getting into\r\ndebt, and fearing exposure, finished his life in an altogether\r\nun-catholic manner at Leipsic in 1774, by shooting himself;--of Keller\r\nand his Urim and Thummim;--of Wollner (who caught the Crown Prince\r\nFrederick William) with his three names of Chrysophiron, Heliconus, and\r\nOphiron, and his fourth name of Ormesus Magnus, under which all the\r\nbrethren were to offer up for him solemn prayers and intercessions;--of\r\nBaron Heinrich von Ekker and Eckenhofen, gentleman of the bed-chamber and\r\ncounsellor of the Duke of Coburg Saalfeld, and his Jewish colleague\r\nHirschmann, with their Asiatic brethren and order named Ben Bicca,\r\nCabalistic and Talmudic; of the Illuminati, and poor Adam Weisshaupt,\r\nProfessor of Canon and National Law at Ingoldstadt in Bavaria, who set up\r\nwhat he considered an Anti-Jesuitical order on a Jesuit model, with some\r\nvague hope, according to his own showing, of \"perfecting the reasoning\r\npowers interesting to mankind, spreading the knowledge of sentiments both\r\nhumane and social, checking wicked inclinations, standing up for\r\noppressed and suffering virtue against all wrong, promoting the\r\nadvancement of men of merit, and in every way facilitating the\r\nacquirement of knowledge and science;\"--of this honest silly man, and his\r\nattempts to carry out all his fine projects by calling himself Spartacus,\r\nBavaria Achaia, Austria Egypt, Vienna Rome, and so forth;--of Knigge, who\r\npicked his honest brains, quarrelled with him, and then made money and\r\nfame out of his plans, for as long as they lasted;--of Bode, the knight\r\nof the lilies of the valley, who, having caught Duke Ernest of Saxe\r\nGotha, was himself caught by Knigge, and his eight, nine, or more\r\nascending orders of unwisdom;--and finally of the Jesuits who, really\r\nwith considerable excuses for their severity, fell upon these poor\r\nfoolish Illuminati in 1784 throughout Bavaria, and had them exiled or\r\nimprisoned;--of all this you may read in the pages of Dr. Findel, and in\r\nmany another book.  For, forgotten as they are now, they made noise\r\nenough in their time.\r\n\r\nAnd so it befell, that this eighteenth century, which is usually held to\r\nbe the most \"materialistic\" of epochs, was, in fact, a most\r\n\"spiritualistic\" one; in which ghosts, demons, quacks, philosophers'\r\nstones, enchanters' wands, mysteries and mummeries, were as\r\nfashionable--as they will probably be again some day.\r\n\r\nYou have all heard of Cagliostro--\"pupil of the sage Althotas, foster-\r\nchild of the Scheriff of Mecca, probable son of the last king of\r\nTrebizond; named also Acharat, and 'Unfortunate child of Nature;' by\r\nprofession healer of diseases, abolisher of wrinkles, friend of the poor\r\nand impotent; grand-master of the Egyptian Mason-lodge of High Science,\r\nspirit-summoner, gold-cook, Grand-Cophta, prophet, priest, Thaumaturgic\r\nmoralist, and swindler\"--born Giuseppe Balsamo of Palermo;--of him, and\r\nof his lovely Countess Seraphina--nee Lorenza Feliciani?  You have read\r\nwhat Goethe--and still more important, what Mr. Carlyle has written on\r\nhim, as on one of the most significant personages of the age?  Remember,\r\nthen, that Cagliostro was no isolated phenomenon; that his success--nay,\r\nhis having even conceived the possibility of success in the brain that\r\nlay within that \"brass-faced, bull-necked, thick-lipped\" head--was made\r\npossible by public opinion.  Had Cagliostro lived in our time, public\r\nopinion would have pointed out to him other roads to honour--on which he\r\nwould doubtless have fared as well.  For when the silly dace try to be\r\ncaught and hope to be caught, he is a foolish pike who cannot gorge them.\r\nBut the method most easy for a pike-nature like Cagliostro's, was in the\r\neighteenth century, as it may be in the latter half of the nineteenth, to\r\ntrade, in a materialist age, on the unsatisfied spiritual cravings of\r\nmankind.  For what do all these phantasms betoken, but a generation\r\nashamed of its own materialism, sensuality, insincerity, ignorance, and\r\nstriving to escape therefrom by any and every mad superstition which\r\nseemed likely to give an answer to the awful questions--What are we, and\r\nwhere? and to lay to rest those instincts of the unseen and infinite\r\naround it, which tormented it like ghosts by day and night: a sight\r\nludicrous or pathetic, according as it is looked on by a cynical or a\r\nhuman spirit.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to call such a phenomenon absurd, improbable.  It is rather\r\nrational, probable, say certain to happen.  Rational, I say; for the\r\nreason of man tells him, and has always told him, that he is a\r\nsupernatural being, if by nature is meant that which is cognisable by his\r\nfive senses: that his coming into this world, his relation to it, his\r\nexit from it--which are the three most important facts about him--are\r\nsupernatural, not to be explained by any deductions from the impressions\r\nof his senses.  And I make bold to say, that the recent discoveries of\r\nphysical science--notably those of embryology--go only to justify that\r\nold and general belief of man.  If man be told that the microscope and\r\nscalpel show no difference, in the first stage of visible existence,\r\nbetween him and the lower mammals, then he has a right to answer--as he\r\nwill answer--So much the worse for the microscope and scalpel: so much\r\nthe better for my old belief, that there is beneath my birth, life,\r\ndeath, a substratum of supernatural causes, imponderable, invisible,\r\nunknowable by any physical science whatsoever.  If you cannot render me a\r\nreason how I came hither, and what I am, I must go to those who will\r\nrender me one.  And if that craving be not satisfied by a rational theory\r\nof life, it will demand satisfaction from some magical theory; as did the\r\nmind of the eighteenth century when, revolting from materialism, it fled\r\nto magic, to explain the ever-astounding miracle of life.\r\n\r\nThe old Regime.  Will our age, in its turn, ever be spoken of as an old\r\nRegime?  Will it ever be spoken of as a Regime at all; as an organised,\r\norderly system of society and polity; and not merely as a chaos, an\r\nanarchy, a transitory struggle, of which the money-lender has been the\r\nreal guide and lord?\r\n\r\nBut at least it will be spoken of as an age of progress, of rapid\r\ndevelopments, of astonishing discoveries.\r\n\r\nAre you so sure of that?  There was an age of progress once.  But what is\r\nour age--what is all which has befallen since 1815--save after-swells of\r\nthat great storm, which are weakening and lulling into heavy calm?  Are\r\nwe on the eve of stagnation?  Of a long check to the human intellect?  Of\r\na new Byzantine era, in which little men will discuss, and ape, the deeds\r\nwhich great men did in their forefathers' days?\r\n\r\nWhat progress--it is a question which some will receive with almost angry\r\nsurprise--what progress has the human mind made since 1815?\r\n\r\nIf the thought be startling, do me the great honour of taking it home,\r\nand verifying for yourselves its truth or its falsehood.  I do not say\r\nthat it is altogether true.  No proposition concerning human things,\r\nstated so broadly, can be.  But see for yourselves, whether it is not at\r\nleast more true than false; whether the ideas, the discoveries, of which\r\nwe boast most in the nineteenth century, are not really due to the end of\r\nthe eighteenth.  Whether other men did not labour, and we have only\r\nentered into their labours.  Whether our positivist spirit, our content\r\nwith the collecting of facts, our dread of vast theories, is not a\r\nsymptom--wholesome, prudent, modest, but still a symptom--of our\r\nconsciousness that we are not as our grandfathers were; that we can no\r\nlonger conceive great ideas, which illumine, for good or evil, the whole\r\nmind and heart of man, and drive him on to dare and suffer desperately.\r\n\r\nRailroads?  Electric telegraphs?  All honour to them in their place: but\r\nthey are not progress; they are only the fruits of past progress.  No\r\noutward and material thing is progress; no machinery causes progress; it\r\nmerely spreads and makes popular the results of progress.  Progress is\r\ninward, of the soul.  And, therefore, improved constitutions, and\r\nimproved book instruction--now miscalled education--are not progress:\r\nthey are at best only fruits and signs thereof.  For they are outward,\r\nmaterial; and progress, I say, is inward.  The self-help and\r\nself-determination of the independent soul--that is the root of progress;\r\nand the more human beings who have that, the more progress there is in\r\nthe world.  Give me a man who, though he can neither read nor write, yet\r\ndares think for himself, and do the thing he believes: that man will help\r\nforward the human race more than any thousand men who have read, or\r\nwritten either, a thousand books apiece, but have not dared to think for\r\nthemselves.  And better for his race, and better, I believe, in the sight\r\nof God, the confusions and mistakes of that one sincere brave man, than\r\nthe second-hand and cowardly correctness of all the thousand.\r\n\r\nAs for the \"triumphs of science,\" let us honour, with astonishment and\r\nawe, the genius of those who invented them; but let us remember that the\r\nthings themselves are as a gun or a sword, with which we can kill our\r\nenemy, but with which also our enemy can kill us.  Like all outward and\r\nmaterial things, they are equally fit for good and for evil.  In England\r\nhere--they have been as yet, as far as I can see, nothing but blessings:\r\nbut I have my very serious doubts whether they are likely to be blessings\r\nto the whole human race, for many an age to come.  I can conceive\r\nthem--may God avert the omen!--the instruments of a more crushing\r\nexecutive centralisation, of a more utter oppression of the bodies and\r\nsouls of men, than the world has yet seen.  I can conceive--may God avert\r\nthe omen!--centuries hence, some future world-ruler sitting at the\r\njunction of all railroads, at the centre of all telegraph-wires--a world-\r\nspider in the omphalos of his world-wide web; and smiting from thence\r\neverything that dared to lift its head, or utter a cry of pain, with a\r\nswiftness and surety to which the craft of a Justinian or a Philip II.\r\nwere but clumsy and impotent.\r\n\r\nAll, all outward things, be sure of it, are good or evil, exactly as far\r\nas they are in the hands of good men or of bad.\r\n\r\nMoreover, paradoxical as it may seem, railroads and telegraphs, instead\r\nof inaugurating an era of progress, may possibly only retard it.  \"Rester\r\nsur un grand succes,\" which was Rossini's advice to a young singer who\r\nhad achieved a triumph, is a maxim which the world often follows, not\r\nonly from prudence, but from necessity.  They have done so much that it\r\nseems neither prudent nor possible to do more.  They will rest and be\r\nthankful.\r\n\r\nThus, gunpowder and printing made rapid changes enough; but those changes\r\nhad no farther development.  The new art of war, the new art of\r\nliterature, remained stationary, or rather receded and degenerated, till\r\nthe end of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nAnd so it may be with our means of locomotion and intercommunion, and\r\nwhat depends on them.  The vast and unprecedented amount of capital, of\r\nsocial interest, of actual human intellect invested--I may say locked\r\nup--in these railroads, and telegraphs, and other triumphs of industry\r\nand science, will not enter into competition against themselves.  They\r\nwill not set themselves free to seek new discoveries in directions which\r\nare often actually opposed to their own, always foreign to it.  If the\r\nmoney of thousands are locked up in these great works, the brains of\r\nhundreds of thousands, and of the very shrewdest too, are equally locked\r\nup therein likewise; and are to be subtracted from the gross material of\r\nsocial development, and added (without personal fault of their owners,\r\nwho may be very good men) to the dead weight of vested selfishness,\r\nignorance, and dislike of change.\r\n\r\nYes.  A Byzantine and stationary age is possible yet.  Perhaps we are now\r\nentering upon it; an age in which mankind shall be satisfied with the\r\n\"triumphs of science,\" and shall look merely to the greatest comfort\r\n(call it not happiness) of the greatest number; and like the debased Jews\r\nof old, \"having found the life of their hand, be therewith content,\" no\r\nmatter in what mud-hole of slavery and superstition.\r\n\r\nBut one hope there is, and more than a hope--one certainty, that however\r\nsatisfied enlightened public opinion may become with the results of\r\nscience, and the progress of the human race, there will be always a more\r\nenlightened private opinion or opinions, which will not be satisfied\r\ntherewith at all; a few men of genius, a few children of light, it may be\r\na few persecuted, and a few martyrs for new truths, who will wish the\r\nworld not to rest and be thankful, but to be discontented with itself,\r\nashamed of itself, striving and toiling upward, without present hope of\r\ngain, till it has reached that unknown goal which Bacon saw afar off, and\r\nlike all other heroes, died in faith, not having received the promises,\r\nbut seeking still a polity which has foundations, whose builder and maker\r\nis God.\r\n\r\nThese will be the men of science, whether physical or spiritual.  Not\r\nmerely the men who utilise and apply that which is known (useful as they\r\nplainly are), but the men who themselves discover that which was unknown,\r\nand are generally deemed useless, if not hurtful, to their race.  They\r\nwill keep the sacred lamp burning unobserved in quiet studies, while all\r\nthe world is gazing only at the gaslights flaring in the street.  They\r\nwill pass that lamp on from hand to hand, modestly, almost stealthily,\r\ntill the day comes round again, when the obscure student shall be\r\ndiscovered once more to be, as he has always been, the strongest man on\r\nearth.  For they follow a mistress whose footsteps may often slip, yet\r\nnever fall; for she walks forward on the eternal facts of Nature, which\r\nare the acted will of God.  A giantess she is; young indeed, but humble\r\nas yet: cautious and modest beyond her years.  She is accused of trying\r\nto scale Olympus, by some who fancy that they have already scaled it\r\nthemselves, and will, of course, brook no rival in their fancied monopoly\r\nof wisdom.\r\n\r\nThe accusation, I believe, is unjust.  And yet science may scale Olympus\r\nafter all.  Without intending it, almost without knowing it, she may find\r\nherself hereafter upon a summit of which she never dreamed; surveying the\r\nuniverse of God in the light of Him who made it and her, and remakes them\r\nboth for ever and ever.  On that summit she may stand hereafter, if only\r\nshe goes on, as she goes now, in humility and in patience; doing the duty\r\nwhich lies nearest her; lured along the upward road, not by ambition,\r\nvanity, or greed, but by reverent curiosity for every new pebble, and\r\nflower, and child, and savage, around her feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n{1}  Mr. H.
