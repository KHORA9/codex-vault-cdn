The Government has\r\nseen fit, at various times, through its authorities, civil and military,\r\nto suppress the circulation and even the publication of journals which,\r\nin its judgment, gave aid and comfort to the enemy, either by disloyal\r\npublications in reference to our affairs, or by encouraging and\r\nlaudatory statements concerning the enemy. The various papers of the\r\ncountry have severally censured or commended the course of the\r\nGovernment in this matter, and the issue between the Press and the\r\nAuthorities has been regarded as of a sufficiently serious nature to\r\ndemand a convocation of editors to consider the subject; of which\r\nconvention Horace Greeley was chairman. A few remarks on the nature of\r\nthe liberty of the press and on its relations to the governing powers\r\nwill not, therefore, at this time, be inopportune.\r\n\r\nMen are apt, at times, in the excitement of political partisanship, to\r\nforget that the freedom of the press is, like all other social liberty,\r\nrelative and not absolute; that it is not license to publish whatsoever\r\nthey please, but only that which is _within certain defined limits_\r\nprescribed by the people as the legitimate extent to which expression\r\nthrough the public prints should be permitted; and that it is because\r\nthese limits are regulated by the whole people, for the whole people,\r\nand not by the arbitrary caprice of a single individual or of an\r\naristocracy, that the press is denominated free. Let it be remembered,\r\nthen, as a starting point, that the press is amenable to the people;\r\nthat it is controlled and regulated by them, and indebted to them for\r\nwhatever measure of freedom it enjoys.\r\n\r\nThe scope of this liberty is carefully defined by the statutes, as also\r\nthe method by which its transgression is to be punished. These\r\nenactments minutely define the nature of an infringement of their\r\nprovisions, and point out the various methods of procedure in order to\r\nredress private grievance or to punish public wrong, in such instances.\r\nThese statutes emanate from the people, are the expression of their\r\nwill, and in consonance with them the action of the executive\r\nauthorities must proceed, whenever the civil law is sufficient for the\r\nexecution of legal measures.\r\n\r\nBut there comes a time, in the course of a nation's existence, when the\r\nusual and regular methods of its life are interrupted; when peaceful\r\nsystems and civilized adaptations are forced to give place to the ruder\r\nand more peremptory modes of procedure which belong to seasons of\r\nhostile strife. The slow, methodical, oftentimes tedious contrivances of\r\nordinary law, admirably adapted for periods of national quietude, are\r\nutterly inadequate to the stern and unforeseen contingencies of civil\r\nwar. Laws which are commonly sufficient to secure justice and afford\r\nprotection, are then comparatively powerless for such ends. The large\r\nmeasure of liberty of speech and of the press safely accorded when there\r\nis ample time to correct false doctrines and to redress grievances\r\nthrough common methods, is incompatible with the rigorous promptitude,\r\nenergy, celerity, and unity of action necessary to the preservation of\r\nnational existence in times of rebellion. If an individual be suspected\r\nof conspiring against his country, at such a time, to leave him at\r\nliberty while the usual processes of law were being undertaken, would\r\nperhaps give him opportunity for consummating his designs and delivering\r\nthe republic into the hands of its enemies. If a portion of the press\r\ncirculate information calculated to aid the foe in the defeat of the\r\nnational armies, to endeavor to prevent this evil by the slow routine of\r\ncivil law, might result in the destruction of the state. The fact that\r\nwe raise armies to secure obedience commonly enforced by the ordinary\r\ncivil officers is a virtual and actual acknowledgment that a new order\r\nof things has arisen for which the usual methods are insufficient, civil\r\nauthority inadequate, and to contend with which powers must be exercised\r\nnot before in vogue. Codes of procedure arranged for an established and\r\nharmoniously working Government cannot answer all the requirements of\r\nthat Government when it is repudiated by a large body of its subjects,\r\nand the existence of the nation itself is in peril.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, therefore, that at times the accustomed methods of Civil\r\ngovernment must, in deference to national safety, be laid aside, to some\r\nextent, and the more vigorous adaptations of Military government\r\nsubstituted in their stead. But it does not follow from this that\r\n_arbitrary_ power is necessarily employed, or that such methods are not\r\nstrictly legal. There is a despotic Civil government and a despotic\r\nMilitary government, a free Civil government and a free Military\r\ngovernment. The Civil government of Russia is despotic; so would its\r\nMilitary government be if internal strife should demand that military\r\nauthority supersede the civil; the Civil government of the United States\r\nis free, so must its Military government be in order to be sustained.\r\n\r\nBut what is a free Military government? There is precisely the same\r\ndifference between a free and a despotic _military_ polity as between a\r\nfree and a despotic _civil_ polity. It is the essential nature of\r\n_despotic_ rule that it recognizes the fountain head of all power to be\r\nthe ruler, and the people are held as the mere creatures of his\r\npleasure. It is the essence of _free_ government that it regards the\r\npeople as the source of all power, and the rulers as their agents,\r\npossessing only such authority as is committed by the former into the\r\nhands of the latter. It matters not, therefore, whether a ruler be\r\nexercising the civil power in times of peaceful national life, or\r\nwhether, in times of rebellion, he wields the military authority\r\nessential to security, he is alike, at either time, a despot or a\r\nrepublican, accordingly as he exercises his power without regard to the\r\nwill of the people, or as he exercises such power only as the national\r\nvoice delegates to him.\r\n\r\nWendell Phillips said in his oration before the Smithsonian Institute:\r\n'Abraham Lincoln sits to-day the greatest despot this side of China.'\r\nThe mistake of Mr. Phillips was this: He confounded the method of\r\nexercising power with the nature of the power exercised. It is the\r\nlatter which decides the question of despotism or of freedom. The\r\nmethods of the republican governor and of the despot may be, in times of\r\nwar _must_ be, for the most part, identical. But the one is,\r\nnevertheless, as truly a republican as the other is a despot. Freedom of\r\nspeech, freedom of the press, the right of travel, the writ of _habeas\r\ncorpus_--these insignia of liberty in a people are dispensed with in\r\ndespotic Governments, because the ruler chooses to deprive the people of\r\ntheir benefits, and for that reason only; they were suspended in our\r\nGovernment because the national safety seemed to demand it, and because\r\nthe President, as the accredited executive of the wishes of the people,\r\nfulfilled their clearly indicated will. In the former case it is lordly\r\nauthority overriding the necks of the people for personal pride or\r\npower; in the latter, it is the ripe fruit of republican civilization,\r\nwhich, in times of danger, can with safety and security overleap, for\r\nthe moment, the mere forms of law, in order to secure its beneficial\r\nresults. They seem to resemble each other; but are as wide apart as\r\nirreligion and that highest religious life which, transcending all\r\nexternal observances, seems to the mere religious formalist to be\r\nidentical with it.\r\n\r\nBut how is the Executive to ascertain the behest of the people? In\r\naccordance with the modes which they, as a part of their behest,\r\nindicate. But as there are two methods of fulfilling the wishes of the\r\npeople, one adapted to the ordinary routine of peaceful times, and\r\nanother to the more summary necessities of war, so there are two\r\nmethods, calculated for these diverse national states, by which the\r\nGovernment must discover the will of the people. The slow, deliberate\r\naction of the ballot box and of the legislative body is amply\r\nexpeditious for the purposes of undisturbed and tranquil periods. But in\r\ntimes of rebellion or invasion, the waiting and delay which are often\r\nessential to the prosecution of forms prescribed for undisturbed epochs\r\nare, as has been said, simply impossible. War is a period in which\r\nmethods and procedures are required diametrically opposite to those\r\nwhich are so fruitful of good in days of peace. The lawbreaker who comes\r\nwith an army at his back cannot be served with a sheriff's warrant, nor\r\narrested by a constable. War involves unforeseen emergencies, to meet\r\nwhich there is no time for calling Congress together, or taking the\r\nsense of the populace by a ballot. It is full of attempted surprises,\r\nwhich must be guarded against on the instant, and of dangers which must\r\nbe quickly avoided, but for whose guardance or avoidance the statutes\r\nmake no provision. Hence arises a necessity for a mode of ascertaining\r\nthe will of the people other than the slow medium of formal legislation\r\nor of balloting.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the United States is the servant of its people. It was\r\nordained to insure for _them_ 'domestic tranquillity, provide for the\r\ncommon defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of\r\nliberty to' themselves and their posterity. Its laws and statutes are\r\nbut the forms by which the people attempt to secure these things. But\r\nthe people are sovereign, even over their laws. As they have instituted\r\nthem _for their own good_, so may they dispense with them for their own\r\ngood, whenever the national safety requires this. As they have\r\nestablished certain modes of lawful procedure _for their own security_,\r\nso may they adopt other modes when their safety demands it. Their laws\r\nand their codes of procedure are for their _uses_, not for their\r\ndestruction. 'When a sister State is endangered, red tape must be cut,'\r\nsaid Governor Seymour, when it was telegraphed to him that some delaying\r\nforms must be gone through in order to arm and send off our State\r\ntroops who were ordered to the defence of Harrisburg; and all the people\r\nsaid, Amen! The people of the United States inaugurated a government,\r\nwhose forms of law were admirably suited to times of peace, but have\r\nbeen found inadequate to seasons of intestine strife. They have, as we\r\nhave seen, superadded, in some degree, other methods of action,\r\nindorsing and adopting those to which the Executive was compelled to\r\nresort as better adapted to changed conditions. They have not done this\r\nin accordance with prescribed forms, in all instances, because the forms\r\nof _civil_ government do not provide for a condition of society in which\r\ncivil authority is virtually abrogated, to a greater or less extent, for\r\nmilitary authority.\r\n\r\nIn the same way and by virtue of the same sovereignty, the people of the\r\nUnited States may lay aside the common method of indicating their\r\npleasure to the Executive, and substitute one more in consonance with\r\nthe requirements of the times. They may make known that they _do_ lay\r\naside an established mode, either by a formal notice or by a general\r\ntacit understanding, as the exigencies of the case require. They may\r\nrecognize the right, aye, the _duty_ of the Executive to act in\r\naccordance with other methods than those prescribed for ordinary\r\nseasons, in cases where the national security demands this.\r\n\r\nBut this is not an abandonment of the methods and forms of law! This is\r\nnot the establishment of an _arbitrary_ government! This is not passing\r\nfrom freedom to despotism! The _people_ of this country are sovereign,\r\nlet it be repeated. So long as its Government is conducted as its people\r\nor as the majority of them wish, it is conducted in accordance with its\r\nestablished principle. There were no freedom if the vital spirit of\r\nliberty were to be held in bondage to the dead forms of powerless or\r\nobsolete prescriptions in the very crisis of the nation's death\r\nstruggle! Freedom means freedom to act, in all cases and under all\r\ncircumstances, so as to secure the highest individual and national\r\nwell-being. It does _not_ mean freedom to establish certain codes of\r\nprocedure under certain regulations, and to be forever bound under these\r\nwhen the preservation of liberty itself demands their temporary\r\nabeyance. So long as the Government fulfils the wishes of the people, it\r\nis not arbitrary, it is not despotic, no matter what methods an\r\nemergency may require it to adopt for this purpose, or in what manner it\r\nascertains these wishes; provided always that the methods adopted and\r\nthe modes of ascertainment are also in accordance with the people's\r\ndesires.\r\n\r\nBut how is the Executive to discover the will of the people if he does\r\nnot wait for its formal expression? How is he to be sure that he does\r\nnot outrun their desires? How is he to be checked and punished, should\r\nhe do so? Precisely the same law must apply here as has been indicated\r\nto be the true one in reference to the fulfilment of the people's\r\nbehest. Fixed, definite, precise, formal expressions of popular will,\r\nwhen time is wanting for these, must be replaced by those which are more\r\nquickly ascertained and less systematically expressed. The Executive\r\nmust forecast the general desire and forestall its commands, regarding\r\nthe tacit acceptance of the people or their _informal_ laws, such as\r\nresolutions, conventions, and various modes of expressing popular accord\r\nor dissent, as indications of the course which they approve. Nor is this\r\nan anomaly in our legal system. The citizen ordinarily is not at liberty\r\nto take the law into his own hands; he must appeal to the constituted\r\nauthorities, and through the machinery of a law court obtain his redress\r\nor protection. But there are times when contingencies arise in which\r\nmore wrong would be done by such delay than by a summary process\r\ntranscending the customary law. The man who sees a child, a woman, or\r\neven an animal treated with cruelty, does not wait to secure protection\r\nfor the injured party by the common methods of legal procedure, but, on\r\nthe instant, prevents, with blows if need be, the outrage. He oversteps\r\nthe forms of law to secure the ends of law, and rests in the\r\nconsciousness that the law itself will accept his action. When the case\r\nis more desperate, his usurpation of power generally prohibited to him\r\nis still greater, up to that last extremity in which he deliberately\r\ntakes the whole law into his own hands, and, acting as accuser, witness,\r\njudge, executioner, slays the individual who assaults him with deadly\r\nweapons or with hostile intent.\r\n\r\nIn this case now stands the nation. Along her borders flashes the steel\r\nof hostile armies, their cannon thunder almost in hearing of our\r\ncapitol, their horses but recently trampled the soil of neighboring\r\nStates. A deadly enemy is trying to get its gripe upon the republic's\r\nthroat and its knife into her heart. The nation must act as an\r\nindividual would under similar circumstances; and the nation must act\r\nthrough its Executive. If one person, attacked by another, should snatch\r\nfrom the hands of a passer his cane, in order to defend his life; if, in\r\nhis struggles with his assailant, he should strike a second through\r\nmisconception, how immeasurably ridiculous would be the action of these\r\nindividuals, should they, while the death struggle were still raging,\r\nberate the man, one for breaking the law by taking away his cane, and\r\nthe other for breaking the law by the commission of a battery! Every man\r\nfeels instinctively that in such a crisis all weapons of defence are at\r\nhis disposal, and that he takes them, _not_ in violation of law, but in\r\nobedience to the law of extraordinary contingencies, which every\r\ncommunity adopts, but which no community can inscribe upon its statute\r\nbook, _because it is_ the law of contingencies.\r\n\r\nThe Executive of this, as of every country, resorts to this law when, in\r\nthe nature of things, the statute law is inadequate. In doing this, he\r\ndoes not violate law; he only adopts another kind of law. A subtle,\r\ndelicate law, indeed, which can neither be inscribed among the\r\nenactments, nor exactly defined, circumscribed, or expressed. When it is\r\nto be substituted for the ordinary modes of legal procedure, how far it\r\nis to be used, when its use must cease--these are questions which the\r\npeople, as the sole final arbiters, must decide. As the individual in\r\nsociety must judge wisely when the community will sanction his use of\r\nthe contingent law, the law of private military power, so to speak, in\r\nhis own behalf; so must the Executive judge when the urgency of the\r\nnational defence demands the exercise of the summary power in the place\r\nof more technical methods. If the public sentiment of the community\r\nsustain the individual, it is an indorsement that he acted justifiably\r\nin accordance with this exceptional law; if it do not, he is liable for\r\nan unwarranted usurpation of power. The Executive stands in the same\r\nrelation to the nation. The Mohammedans relate that the road to heaven\r\nis two miles long, stretching over a fathomless abyss, the only pathway\r\nacross which is narrower than a razor's edge. Delicately balanced must\r\nbe the body which goes over in safety! The intangible path which the\r\nExecutive must walk to meet the people's wishes on the one side, and to\r\navoid their fears upon the other, in the national peril, is narrower\r\nthan the Mahommedan's road to heaven, and cautiously bold must be the\r\nfeet that safely tread it! Blessed shall that man be who succeeds in\r\ncrossing. The nations shall rise up and call him blessed, and succeeding\r\ngenerations shall praise him.\r\n\r\nWe come then to the relations of the press and the Executive. We have\r\nseen that all liberty is _relative_, and not _absolute_; that the\r\npeople, the sovereigns in this country, have prescribed certain methods\r\nfor securing, in ordinary periods, those blessings which it is their\r\ndesire to enjoy; that when, under special contingencies, these methods\r\nbecome insufficient for this purpose, the people may, in virtue of their\r\nsovereignty, suspend them and adopt others adequate to the occasion;\r\nthat these may not, indeed, from their very nature, cannot be of a fixed\r\nand circumscribed kind, but must give large discretionary power into the\r\nhands of the Executive, to be used by him in a summary manner as\r\ncontingencies may indicate; that this abrogation or suspension, for the\r\ntime, of so much of the ordinary civil law, in favor of the contingent\r\nlaw, is not an abandonment of free government for arbitary or despotic\r\ngovernment, because it is still in accordance with the will of the\r\npeople, and hence is merely the substitution of a new form of law,\r\nwhich, being required for occasions when instant action is demanded, is\r\nnecessarily summary in its character; that the extent to which this law\r\nis to be substituted for the ordinary one is to be discovered by the\r\nExecutive from the general sense of the nation, when it cannot be made\r\nknown through the common method of the ballot box and the legislature;\r\nthat in the people resides the power ultimately to determine whether\r\ntheir wishes have been correctly interpreted or not; and, finally, that\r\nthe Executive is equally responsible for coming short of the behests of\r\nthe nation in the use of the contingent law or for transgressing the\r\nboundaries within which they desire him to constrain his actions.\r\n\r\nThe press of the United States has always been free to the extent that\r\nit might publish whatsoever it listed, _within certain limits prescribed\r\nby the law_. The press may still do this. But the nature of the law\r\nwhich prescribes the limits has changed with the times. The constituted\r\nauthorities of the people of the United States are obliged now, in the\r\npeople's interest, to employ the processes of summary rather than those\r\nof routine law. Hence when the press infringes too violently the\r\nboundaries indicated, and persists in so doing, the sterner penalty\r\ndemanded by the dangers of the hour is enforced by the sterner method\r\nlikewise rendered necessary. So long as Executive action concerning the\r\npress shall be _in accordance_ with the general sentiment of the people,\r\nit will be within the strict scope of the highest law of the land.\r\nShould the Executive persistently exercise this summary law in a manner\r\nnot countenanced by the nation, he is amenable to it under the strict\r\nletter of the Constitution for high crimes or misdemeanors, not the\r\nleast of which would be the usurpation of powers not delegated to him by\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nThe Executive of the United States occupies at this time an exceedingly\r\ntrying and dangerous position, which demands for him the cordial,\r\npatient, and delicate consideration of the American nation. He is placed\r\nin a situation where the very existence of the republic requires that he\r\nuse powers not technically delegated to him, and in which the people\r\nexpect, yea, demand him, to adopt methods transcending the strict letter\r\nof statute law, the use of which powers and the adoption of which\r\nmethods would be denounced as the worst of crimes, even made the basis\r\nof an impeachment, should the mass of the populace be dissatisfied with\r\nhis proceedings. It is easy to find fault, easy in positions devoid of\r\npublic responsibility to think we see how errors might have been\r\navoided, how powers might have been more successfully employed and\r\ngreater results achieved. But the American Executive is surrounded with\r\ndifficulties too little appreciated by the public, while an almost\r\nmerciless criticism, emanating both from injudicious friends and\r\nvigilant foes, follows his every action. Criticism should not be\r\nrelaxed; but it should be exercised by those only who are competent to\r\nundertake its office. The perusal of the morning paper does not\r\nordinarily put us in possession of sufficient information to enable us\r\nto understand, in all their bearings, the measures of the Government.\r\nSomething more is required than a reading of the accounts of battles\r\nfurnished by the correspondents of the press to entitle one to express\r\nan opinion on military movements. It should not be forgotten that the\r\nofficers engaged in the army of the United States are better judges of\r\nmilitary affairs than civilians at home; that the proceedings of the\r\nGovernment, with rare exceptions, possibly, are based upon a fuller\r\nknowledge of all the facts relating to a special case, than is obtained\r\nby private persons, and that its judgment is therefore more likely to be\r\ncorrect, in any given instance, than our own. The injury done to the\r\nnational cause by the persistent animadversion of well-intentioned men,\r\nwho cannot conceive that their judgments may perchance be incorrect, is\r\nscarcely less, than the openly hostile invective of the friends of the\r\nSouth. The intelligent citizens of the North, especially those who\r\noccupy prominent positions as teachers and instructors of the people\r\nthrough the press, the pulpit, and other avenues, should ever be mindful\r\nthat the _political_ liberty which they possess of free thought and free\r\nspeech, has imposed upon them the moral duty of using this wisely for\r\nthe welfare of humanity, and that they cannot be faithless to this\r\nobligation without injuring their fellow men and incurring a heavy moral\r\nguilt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BROTHERS.\r\n\r\nAN ALLEGORY.\r\n\r\nDEDICATION, TO ONE WHO WILL UNDERSTAND IT:\r\n\r\n\r\n  'I love thee freely, as men strive for right;\r\n  I love thee purely, us they turn from praise\r\n  I love thee with the passion put to use\r\n  In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith;\r\n  I love thee with a love I seemed to lose\r\n  With my lost saints,--I love thee with the breath,\r\n  Smiles, tears, of all my life!--and, if God choose,\r\n  I shall but love thee dearer after death.'\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Creator still loved and guarded the earth, although its children had\r\ndeparted from their early obedience. In evidence of His care, He sent,\r\nfrom time to time, gifted spirits among men to aid them in developing\r\nand elevating the souls so fallen from their primal innocence. These\r\nspirits He clad in sensuous bodies, that they might be prepared to enter\r\nthe far country of Human Life. Earth was rapidly falling under the\r\nmerciless rule of a hopeless and crushing materialism, when He\r\ndetermined upon sending among men, Anselm, the saint; Angelo, the tone\r\nartist; Zophiel, the poet; and Jemschid, the painter. The spirits\r\nmurmured not, although they knew they were to relinquish their heaven\r\nlife for that torment of perpetual struggle which the forbidden\r\nknowledge of Good and Evil has entailed upon all incarcerated in a human\r\nform.\r\n\r\n  _For self-abnegation is the law of heaven!_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'Brothers,' said the merciful Father, 'go, and sin not, for of all\r\nthings that pass among men must a strict account be rendered. For are\r\nnot their evil deeds written upon the eternally living memory of a just\r\nGod? Evil lurks in the land of your exile; it may find its way into your\r\nown hearts, for you are to become wholly human, and to lose for a time\r\nthe memory of your home in heaven. But even in that far country you will\r\nfind the Book of Life, which I have given for the guidance and\r\nconsolation of the fallen. For it is known even there that 'God is\r\nLove!''\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen the journey of the Heaven Brothers began through the blinding\r\nclouds and trailing mists of chaos, in whose palpable gloom all memories\r\nare obliterated. Naked, trembling, and human, they arrived upon the\r\nshifting sands of the world of Time and Death.\r\n\r\nA vague, shadowy sense, like a forgotten dream which we struggle vainly\r\nto recall, often flitted through their clay-clogged souls, of a\r\nstrangely glorious life in some higher sphere; but all attempts to give\r\ndefinite form to such bewildering visions ended but in fantastic\r\nreveries of mystic possibilities or dim yearnings of unseen glories.\r\nThey found the Book of Life, but they remembered not that the Father had\r\ntold them the Word was His.\r\n\r\nFor the thread of _Identity_, on which are strung the pearls of\r\n_Memory_, in the passage through chaos had snapped in twain!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLike the silver light through the storm clouds flitting over the fair\r\nface of the moon, gleam the antenatal splendors through the gloom of the\r\nearth life.\r\n\r\nAs Anselm wonderingly turned the pages of the Book of Life, strange\r\nmemories awoke within him. So inextricably were the dreams of his past\r\nwoven with the burning visions of the Prophets, that the darkness of\r\nRevelation, like the heaven vault at midnight, was illumined by the\r\nlight of distant worlds; his own vague reminiscences supplying the inner\r\nsense of the inspired but mystic leaves. What wonder that he loved the\r\nBook, when in its descriptions of the life to _come_, he felt the\r\nhistory of the life already _past_; and through its sternest\r\nthreatenings, like the rainbow girdling storm clouds, shone the promise\r\nof a blessed future!\r\n\r\nHe spent the hours of exile in a constant effort to commune with the\r\nFather; in humble prayer and supplication for strength to resist the\r\npower of sin. For he feared the Evil which lurked in the land. He\r\nexamined the springs of his own actions, analyzed his motives, and\r\ntortured himself lest any of the evils denounced in the Book should lurk\r\nin the folds of his own soul. In contemplating the awful justice of the\r\nFather, he sometimes forgot that He is Love. He feared close commune\r\nwith the children of the earth, for Evil dwelt among them; he looked not\r\ninto the winecup, nor danced with the maidens under the caressing\r\ntendrils of the vine or the luxuriant branches of the myrtle--nay, the\r\nrose cheek of the maiden was a terror to him, for lo! Evil might lurk\r\nunder its brilliant bloom. The Dread of Evil sapped the Joy of Life!\r\n\r\nHe turned from all the lovely Present, to catch faint traces of the dim\r\nPast, to picture the unseen Future, about which it is vain to disquiet\r\nourselves, since, like everything else, it rests upon the heart of God!\r\nHis life was holy, innocent, and self-sacrificing. He sought to serve\r\nhis fellow men, yet feared to give them his heart, lest he should rob\r\nthe Father of His just due. He knew not from his own experience that\r\nLove is infinite, and grows on what it gives. He bore religious\r\nconsolation to the afflicted, aid to the needy, sympathy to the\r\nsuffering. He was universally esteemed, but the spirit of his brethren\r\nbroke not into joy at his approach, for the _trusting_ heart of genial\r\nhumanity throbbed not in his sad breast. He was no Pharisee, but he\r\ndined not with the Publican, and the precious ointment of the Magdalen\r\nnever bathed his weary head. His language was: 'All is fleeting and\r\nevil, save Thee, O my Father; in Thee alone can rest be found!'\r\n\r\nSolace for human anguish can only be found upon the heart of love. 'Thou\r\nshalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, with\r\nall thy mind: and thy neighbor as thyself!' Blessed Son of Mary! Thou\r\nalone hast fully kept these _two_ commandments!\r\n\r\n'For wisdom is justified of her children!'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAngelo, Zophiel, and Jemschid also resolved to avoid the Evil spoken of\r\nin the Book of Life. But the far country into which the Father had sent\r\nthem was lovely in their eyes, and they were charmed with the Beauty\r\nwith which He had surrounded them. They dreamed by the shady fountains,\r\nwith their silver flow and gentle ripples; roamed by the darker rivers\r\nas they hurry on to plunge themselves into the sea; gazed on the\r\nrestless ocean breakers when the dying sun fringes their crest with\r\nrainbow hues, and the flushing sky, to cool her burning blushes, flings\r\nherself into the heart of the restless waters. They loved to breathe the\r\n'difficult air' of mountain tops, so softly pillowed and curtained by\r\nthe fleecy vapors, which they win again from heaven in limpid streams,\r\nleading them in wild leaps through gloomy chasms fringed by timid\r\nharebells, whose soft blue eyes look love upon the rocks, while the\r\nmyriad forest leaves musically murmur above their flinty couch. They\r\nwatched the fitful shadow-dance of clouds over the green earth. They\r\nloved to see these heaven tents where Beauty dwells chased by the young\r\nzephyrs, or, driven on in heavy masses by the bolder winds, blush under\r\nthe fiery glances of the sun, and melt into the sky upon his nearer\r\napproach. Ah! these clouds and vapors had more than human tenderness,\r\nfor had they not seen them throng around the ghastly disc of the\r\nstar-deserted moon, weaving their light webs into flowing veils to\r\nshadow the majestic sorrow written upon her melancholy but lovely face,\r\nshielding the mystic pallor of the virgin brow from the desecrating gaze\r\nof the profane?\r\n\r\nThe three brothers were happy upon earth, for they looked into the heart\r\nof their fellow mortals, and felt the genial feeling beating there; and\r\nso luxuriantly twined its vivid green around, that the evil core was\r\nhidden from their charmed eyes, and they ceased not to bless the Father\r\nfor a gift so divine as Human Love! They could not weep and pray the\r\nlong night through, as did the saintly Anselm, for their eyes were\r\nfastened upon the wildering lustre of the thronging stars as they wove\r\ntheir magic rings through the dim abysses of distant space, yet the\r\nincense of constant praise rose from their happy souls to the\r\nBeauty-giving Father.\r\n\r\nThey struggled to awake the sleeping powers of men to a perception of\r\nthe glories of creation; to lead them 'through nature up to nature's\r\nGod.' The Artist-Brothers were closely united in feeling, striving\r\nthrough different mediums to refine the soul of man.\r\n\r\nFor the spirit of Beauty always awakens the spirit of Love, sent by God\r\nto elevate and consecrate the heart of man!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf a more subtle genius and more daring spirit than Zophiel or Jemschid,\r\nAngelo boldly launched into the bewildering chaos of the realm of\r\nsound. As yet the laws of the Acoustic Prism were unknown; the\r\nseven-ranged ladder was all unformed, and without its aid it seemed\r\nimpossible to scale the ever-renewing heights, to sound the ever-growing\r\ndepths of this enchanted kingdom. But Angelo was a bold adventurer.\r\nHaunted by the heaven sounds, vague memories of his antenatal existence,\r\nalthough he had entirely lost the _meaning_ of their flow, as one may\r\nrecall snatches of the melody of a song when he cannot remember one of\r\nits words--he commenced his subtle task. He resolved the Acoustic Prism;\r\nhe built the seven-runged ladder; he charmed the wandering Tones, and\r\nbound them in the holy laws of Rhythm. Divining the hidden secrets of\r\ntheir affiliations, relations, loves, and hates, he wrought them into\r\ngorgeous webs of harmonics, to clothe the tender but fiery soul of\r\never-living melodies. Soothing their jarring dissonances into sweet\r\naccord, he filled their pining wails with that 'divine sorrow,' that\r\nmystic longing for the Infinite, which is the inner voice of every\r\ncreated heart. If he could not find the _heaven sense_ of the tones, he\r\nfound their _earthly meaning_, and caused them to repeat or suggest\r\nevery joy and sorrow of which our nature is capable. He forced the\r\nheaven tongue to become _human_, while it retained its _divine_. Without\r\na model or external archetype, he formed his realm and divined its\r\nchanging limits; wide enough to contain all that is noble, holy enough\r\nto exclude all that is low or profane. He forever exorcised the spirits\r\nof Evil--the strong Demons of materialism--from his rhythmed world.\r\nFlinging his spells on the unseen air, he forced it to breathe his\r\npassion, his sighs; he saddened it with his tears, kindled it with his\r\nrapture, until fired and charged with the electric breath of the soul,\r\nit glowed into an atmosphere of Life, swaying at will the wild and\r\nrestless heart. He created _Music, the only universal language_, holding\r\nthe keys of Memory, and wearing the crown of Hope. Angelo, strange\r\narchitect in that dim domain of chaos, thy creation, fleeting,\r\ninvisible, and unembodied, is in perpetual, flow; changeful as the play\r\nof clouds, yet stable as the eternal laws by which they form their misty\r\ntowers, their glittering fanes, and foam-crested pinnacles! Trackless as\r\nthe wind, yet as powerful, thy sweet spirit, Music, floats wherever\r\nbeats the human heart, for Rhythm rocks the core of life. Music nerves\r\nthe soul with strength or dissolves it in love; she idealizes Pain into\r\nsoul-touching Beauty; assuming all garbs, robing herself in all modes,\r\nand moving at ease through every phase of our complicated existence.\r\nWhite and glittering are her robes, yet she is no aristocrat. She\r\ndisdains not to soothe the weary negro in his chains, or to rock the\r\ncradle of the child of shame, as the betrayed and forsaken girl murmurs\r\nbroken-hearted lullabies around the young 'inheritor of pain.' She is\r\nwith the maiden in the graceful mazes of the gay Mazourka; she inflames\r\nthe savage in the barbaric clang of the fierce war-dance; or marks the\r\nmeasured tramp of the drilled soldiery of civilization. She is in the\r\ncourt of kings; she makes eloquent the ripe lip of the cultured beauty;\r\nshe chants in the dreary cell of the hermit; she lightens the dusty\r\nwallet of the wanderer. She glitters through the dreams of the Poet; she\r\nbreathes through the direst tragedies of noblest souls. On--on she\r\nfloats through the wide world, everywhere present, everywhere welcome,\r\nrefining, and consecrating our dull life from the Baptismal Font to the\r\nGrave!\r\n\r\nAll the inner processes of life are guarded by the hand of nature. In\r\nvain would the curiosity of the scalpel knife invade the sanctuary of\r\nthe beating heart to lay open the burning mystery of Being. The outraged\r\nLife retreats before it to its last citadel, and the indignant heart,\r\nupon its entrance, refuses to throb more. The citadel is taken; but the\r\nsecret of _Life_ is not to be discovered in the kingdom of _Death_. It\r\nis because Music is essentially a _living_ art that we find it\r\nimpossible to read the mystery of its being. If Painting touch us, we\r\ncan always trace the emotion to its exciting cause; if we weep over the\r\npages of the Poet, it is because we find our own blighted hopes imaged\r\nthere. But why does Music sway us? Where did we learn that language\r\nwithout words? in what consists its mystic affinities with our spirits?\r\nWhy does the harp of David soothe the insanity of Saul? Is not its\r\nfestal voice too triumphant to be the accompaniment of our own sad,\r\nfallen being; its breath of sorrow too divine to be the echo of our\r\npetty cares? All other arts arise from the facts of our earthly\r\nexistence, but Music has no external archetype, and refuses to submit\r\nher ethereal soul to our curious analysis. _'I am so, because so I am,'_\r\nis the only answer she gives to the queries of materialism. Like the\r\nprimitive rock, the skeleton of earth's burning heart, she looms up\r\nthrough the base of our existence. Addressing herself to some mystic\r\nfaculty born before thought or language, she lulls the suffering baby\r\ninto its first sleep, using perhaps the primeval and universal language\r\nof the race. For the love which receives the New Born, cadences the\r\nmonotonous chant; and human sympathies are felt by the innocent and\r\nconfiding infant before his eyes are opened fully upon the light, before\r\nhis tongue can syllable a word, his ear detect their divisions, or his\r\nmind divine their significations. But Music looms not only through the\r\nbase of our being; like the encompassing sky, her arch spans our\r\nhorizon. Lo! is it not the language through which the Angels convey the\r\nsecrets of their profound adoration to the Heart of God!\r\n\r\n'Having every one of them harps'--'and they _sung_ a new song'--in which\r\nare to join 'every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and\r\nunder the earth, and such as are in the sea'--'and the number of them\r\nwas ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands.'\r\n(Revelation, chap, v.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile Angelo linked the fiery tones in rhythmed laws, Zophiel sketched\r\nwith glowing pen the joys of virtue, the glories of the intellect, and\r\nthe pleasures, pains, raptures, woes, and loves of the heart. The deeds\r\nof heroes were sung in Epic; Dramas, Elegies, and Lyrics syllabled the\r\ninner life; men listened to the ennobling strains, and became _freemen_\r\nas they heard. The intermingling flow of high thought and melodious\r\nmeasures elevated and soothed the soul, and love for, and faith in,\r\nhumanity, were awakened and nourished by the true Poet.\r\n\r\nJemschid wrought with brush and pencil, until the canvas imaged his\r\nloved skies and mountains, glowed with the noble deeds of men, and\r\npictured that spiritual force which strangely characterizes and mingles\r\nwith the ethereal grace of woman's fragile form.\r\n\r\nThrough the artists, life grew into loveliness, for all was idealized,\r\nand the scattered and hidden beauties of the universe were brought to\r\nlight. The plan of creation is far too vast to be embraced in its\r\ncomplex unity by the finite: it is the province of art to divide,\r\ncondense, concentrate, reunite, and rearrange the vast materials in\r\nsmaller frames, but the new work must always be a _whole_. Angelo\r\naroused and excited the emotions of the soul, which Zophiel analyzed and\r\ndescribed in words most eloquent; while Jemschid made clearer to his\r\nbrethren that Beauty of creation which is an ever visible proof of the\r\nlove of God. His portraits illumined the walls of the bereaved, keeping\r\nfresh for them the images of the loved and lost. Historical pictures\r\nenlarged the mind of his people, keeping before it the high deeds of its\r\nchildren and stimulating to noble prowess. His landscapes warmed the\r\ndingy city homes, bringing even there the blue sky, the clouds, the\r\nstreams, the forests, the mountains, moss, and flowers.\r\n\r\nMen became happier and better, for the Brothers, in showing the\r\n_universal Beauty_, awakened the _universal Love_.\r\n\r\nFor the true essence of man, made in the image of God, is also Love!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe artists turned not from the rose-cheek of the maiden, nor refused\r\nthe touch of the ruby lip; but they loved her too well to sully by one\r\nwronging thought the tender confidence of perfect innocence, or cause\r\nher guileless heart a single pang. For womanhood was holy in their\r\nsight!\r\n\r\nAmong earth's purest maidens shone a fair Lily, whose virgin leaves had\r\nall grown toward the sky; whose cup of snow had never been filled save\r\nby the dews of heaven; whose tall circlet of golden stamens seemed more\r\nlike altar lamps arranged to light a sanctuary, than meant to warm and\r\nbrighten the heart of human love. But the devotion of a noble heart is a\r\nholy thing; Genius is full of magic power, and the maiden did not always\r\nremain insensible to the love of Angelo, for he was spiritually\r\nbeautiful, and when he moved in the world of his own creation, his face\r\nshone as it were the face of an angel. In ethereal 'fantasies' and\r\ndivine 'adagios,' he won the Lily to rest its snowy cup upon his manly\r\nheart. He soothed the earth cares with the heaven tones and beautified\r\nthe bitter realities of life by transfiguring them into passionate\r\nlongings for the Perfect. Bathed in Music's heavenly dew, and warmed by\r\nthe fire of a young heart, the snow petals of the Lily multiplied, the\r\nbud slowly oped, and allowed the perfumed heart to exhale its blessed\r\nodor; and as Love threw his glowing light upon the leaves, they blushed\r\nbeneath his glance of fire--and thus the pale flower grew into a\r\nfragrant Rose, around which one faithful Bulbul ever sang. Sheltered in\r\nthe close folds of the perfumed leaves, what chill could reach the heart\r\nof Angelo? His Rose cradled his genius in her heart, while he poured for\r\nher the golden flow of the tones, coloring them with the hues of Love,\r\nand filling them with the joys of Purity and Peace. Alike in their\r\nsusceptibility to tenderness and beauty are the woman and the artist;\r\nand she who would find full sympathy and comprehension must seek it in\r\nhis heart!\r\n\r\nTime passed on with Anselm, the Saint; Angelo, the Musician; Zophiel,\r\nthe Poet; Jemschid, the Painter. But the _artists_ grew not old, for\r\nBeauty keeps green the heart of her worshippers; and Art, immortal\r\nthough she be, is indigenous, and, happy in her natal soil, exhausts not\r\nthe heart of her children. Anselm, however, seemed already old, with his\r\npure heart sick--sick for the Evil possessing the earth. Alas! holiness\r\nis an exotic here, soon exhausting the soil of clay in which it pines,\r\nand ever sighing to win its transplantation to its native clime.\r\n\r\n  'The Lethe of Nature\r\n    Can't trance him again,\r\n  Whose soul sees the Perfect\r\n    His eyes seek in vain.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was midnight, and Anselm, worn with fasts and pale with vigils, knelt\r\nat his devotions in his lonely cell. Lo! a majestic form of fearful but\r\nperfect beauty stood beside him. The Angel was clad in linen, white as\r\nsnow, and his voice startled the soul like the sound of the last\r\ntrumpet.\r\n\r\n'Gird up thy loins like a man, for the darksome doors of Death stand\r\nopen before thee, and this night thy Lord requires thy spirit!' said the\r\nmighty messenger.\r\n\r\nAnselm trembled. He feared to stand before the All-seeing Eye, whose\r\ndread majesty subdued his soul.\r\n\r\n'Behold! He putteth no trust in His saints, and the heavens are not\r\npure in His sight,' he murmured. But he hesitated not to obey, and\r\ngiving his hand to the Angel, said:\r\n\r\n'Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him!'\r\n\r\nHis earnest lips still thrilling with a prayer for mercy, together they\r\ndeparted 'for that bourne from which no traveller returns.' Between the\r\nimperfections of the created and the perfections of the Creator, what\r\ncan fill the infinite abyss? Infinite Love alone!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe artist-brothers had never separated. Music, Poetry, and Painting\r\nspring from the triune existence of man, represent his life in its\r\ntriune being, and thus move harmoniously together.\r\n\r\nThey had made their home the happiest spot on earth.\r\n\r\nIt was evening, and the Poet seemed lost in revery as he gazed on the\r\ndying light. His hand rested tenderly on the shoulder of a dark but\r\nbrilliant woman, who loved him with the strength of a fervid soul.\r\n\r\n'Sibyl,' said he softly to his young wife, 'were I now to leave thee,\r\nhow many of my lines would remain written on thy heart?'\r\n\r\n'All! they are all graven there,' replied the enthusiast, 'for the\r\nglowing words of a pure poet are the true echoes of a woman's soul!'\r\n\r\nThe Painter sat near them, putting the last touches upon a picture of a\r\nVirgin and Child, which he was striving so to finish that his brethren\r\nmight be able to grasp more fully that sweet scene of human love and\r\nGod's strange mercy.\r\n\r\nTender were the shadows that fell from the veiling lashes on the rounded\r\ncheek of his fair model; lustrous, yet soft and meek, the light from the\r\nmaiden's eye as she gazed upon the beautiful infant resting on her\r\nbosom. The name of the child was Jemschid, and there was in that name a\r\ncharm sufficient to awaken her innocent love.\r\n\r\nShe was the betrothed of the Painter.\r\n\r\n'Imogen!' said he to the fair model, 'I know not why the thought rushes\r\nso sadly over me, but I feel I shall never finish this picture. The\r\ntraits escape me--I cannot find them.'\r\n\r\n'Never finish the beautiful Madonna, to which you have given so much\r\ntime, and on which you have expended so much care!' Then with a sudden\r\nchange of tone, in which astonishment darkened into fear, she exclaimed:\r\n'Are you ill, Jemschid? You have already worked too long upon it. You\r\nwill destroy your health; you need rest.'\r\n\r\n'Nay, sweet Imogen, not so; I am well, quite well, and too happy for\r\nwords. But I cannot finish the picture. I have lost the expression for\r\nthe face of the Madonna. Six months ago, when I began it, your face was\r\nso meek and tranquil it served me well, but now, even with its present\r\nair of meek entreaty, it is too passionate for the mother of God. It is\r\nfar dearer thus to me, Imogen--but I can never finish the painting\r\nnow--and only an angel can, for your young face is fairer and purer than\r\naught else on earth.'\r\n\r\nAgain fell the heavy lashes, half veiling the innocent love in the timid\r\neyes, as the Painter parted the massive braids from the spotless brow,\r\nand softly kissed the snowy forehead of his betrothed.\r\n\r\nThe harp of Angelo quivered, as the sun set behind the crimson clouds,\r\nunder his nervous touch. Some sadness seemed to weigh upon his buoyant\r\nspirit too, in this eventful eve. His music always pictured the depths\r\nof his own soul, and he forced the heaven tones to wail the human\r\nMiserere. But the Beauty into which the sorrow was transfigured gave\r\npromise that it would end in the triumphant chorus of the 'Hosanna in\r\nExcelsis.' For music gives the absolute peace in the absolute conflict;\r\nthe absolute conflict to terminate in the absolute peace.\r\n\r\nFair as the Angel of Hope, the Rose listened with her heart. Her\r\nchildlike, deep blue eyes were raised to heaven, while her long golden\r\ncurls, lighting rather than shading her pale brow, like the halos of dim\r\nglory which the light vapors wreathe round the moon, mingled with the\r\ndarker flow of wavy hair falling upon the shoulder of the harpist, on\r\nwhich she leaned as if to catch the flying sounds as they soared from\r\nthe heart of the loved one.\r\n\r\n'Thy song is very sad,' said the Rose, as her eyes rested tenderly upon\r\nthe inspired face. 'Is there no Gloria to-night, Angelo?'\r\n\r\n'I cannot sing it now, sweet Rosalie! The Hosanna is for heaven; not for\r\na world in which Love is, and Death may enter. If I am to lose thee, my\r\nsoul must chant the Miserere. Ah! that thought unmans me. I cannot part\r\nfrom thee, sweet wife. Cling closer, closer to me, Rosalie. There! Death\r\nmust be strong to untwine that clasp! But he alone is strong--and\r\nLove'--\r\n\r\n'Love is stronger far!' cried the startled Rose, as she buried her face\r\nin the bosom of her husband, to hide the unwonted tears which dimmed her\r\ntrustful eyes.\r\n\r\n'Parting! there is no parting for those whom God has joined. His ties\r\nare for eternity. The Merciful parts not those whom He has made for each\r\nother. Even if we must chant the Miserere here, together will we chant\r\nthe Gloria before the throne of our Creator. Ah, Angelo, do you not feel\r\nthat but _one_ life throbs in our _two_ hearts? Parting and Death are\r\nonly seeming!'\r\n\r\nThus sped time on until midnight was upon the earth. The little group\r\nwere still together; mystic thoughts and previsions were upon them.\r\nZophiel read at intervals weird passages from the Book of Life; Jemschid\r\ntouched, now and then, the face of the Madonna, and some unwonted spirit\r\nof sorrow brooded over the harp of Angelo.\r\n\r\n'Rosalie! once more the Miserere ere we sleep,' said he. Scarcely had he\r\ncommenced the solemn chant, when, suddenly resting his hand on the\r\nchords, he cried: 'Hark! brothers. It is the voice of Anselm--he calls\r\nhe calls us--but I hear not what he says. Listen!'\r\n\r\nLo! a Shining One from the court of the Great King suddenly stands among\r\nthem. His gossamer robes seemed woven of the deep blue of the fields of\r\nspace through which he had just passed, and the stars were glittering\r\nthrough the graceful folds bound with rare devices, wrought from the\r\njasper, onyx, and chrysoprase of the heavenly city.\r\n\r\n'Brothers!' said the sweet voice of the beautiful vision, 'the term of\r\nexile is past; the Father has sent me to recall His children.'\r\n\r\nBut the heart of the artists sank, for the human love was strong in\r\ntheir bosoms.\r\n\r\nJemschid gazed upon the betrothed bride; the unfinished picture; and\r\ntears rushed into his sad eyes.\r\n\r\nThe Angel was touched with pity for the double grief of artist and\r\nlover, and said:\r\n\r\n'Gaze not so sorrowfully upon the unwedded maiden; the unfinished\r\npicture! She shall yet be thine-and the picture shall be dear to thy\r\nfellow men. Lo! I am Rubi, the angel of Beauty!'\r\n\r\nThen, taking the brush in his glittering hands, with rapid touch he gave\r\nthe lovely face an expression of tender innocence, of virgin purity, of\r\nmaternal love and adoration, which will never cease to thrill the heart\r\nof the faithful.\r\n\r\n'It is the Mother of our Lord!' said the astonished brothers, as they\r\ngazed upon the finished work.\r\n\r\n'Zophiel!' continued the pitying angel, 'the lips of Sibyl shall repeat\r\nthy songs, for they are all graven upon her heart! But you are now to\r\nchant in heaven, and the canticle is to be for His praise who made all;\r\nand when you exalt Him, put forth all your strength, and be not weary;\r\nfor you can never go far enough!\r\n\r\n'Angelo! the Hosanna is for heaven. The Rose lingers not here to chant\r\nalone the Miserere.'\r\n\r\nAlas! the wild human dread and sorrow overpowered all else in the\r\nbreasts of the brothers as they gazed upon the women of their love. A\r\nstrange smile played over the heavenly face of the Angel as he murmured:\r\n_'Are they not safe in the bosom of the everlasting Love?'_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSlowly through the Valley of the Shadow--and then more rapid than the\r\nflight of thought, moved the brothers, on--on--through myriads upon\r\nmyriads of blazing suns, of starry universes; on--on--until they reached\r\nthe limits of space, the boundary of material worlds. The angels left\r\nthem as they entered the primeval night of chaos, the shoreless ocean\r\nbetween the sensuous and spiritual life. For alone with God through\r\nchaos do we arrive at the sensuous body; alone with God in chaos do we\r\nleave this body of corruption, from which is evolved the Body of the\r\nSpirit, 'glorious and unchangeable.' And again is clasped the thread of\r\n_Identity,_ on which are strung the pearls of memory, and the Past and\r\nFuture of Time become the Eternal Present!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nClothed in immortal vesture, the brothers now stand before that Great\r\nWhite Throne, which has no shadow, but is built of Light inaccessible,\r\nand full of Glory.\r\n\r\nSummoned by the Holy Lawgiver, the meek Anselm knelt before Him, blinded\r\nwith splendor, dazzled with fathomless majesty.\r\n\r\n'Behold thy creature before thee for judgment, O Thou in whose sight the\r\nangels are not pure! We are born to evil, and who may endure thy\r\njustice? Look not into my weak and sinful heart, O God, but upon the\r\nface of Thy Anointed, in whom is all my trust! Have mercy upon me!'\r\n\r\nTears of mingled gratitude and penitence welled up, as in the days of\r\nexile, from his self-accusing breast.\r\n\r\nWonderful condescension the Father Himself wiped them from the downcast\r\neyes!\r\n\r\nAnd the Saviour of men clothed him in a garment of fine linen, white and\r\npure, and 'to him was given the hidden manna, and a white stone, and in\r\nthe stone a new name written, which no man knoweth but he that receiveth\r\nit.'\r\n\r\nThen the words over whose mystic meaning he had so often pondered, came,\r\nlike the sound of many waters, upon his ear:\r\n\r\n'And he that shall overcome, and keep my works unto the end, to him I\r\nwill give power over the nations; and he shall rule them with a rod of\r\niron, and as the vessel of a potter they shall be broken.\r\n\r\n'And I will give him the morning star.'\r\n\r\nThus the humble and self-abnegating Anselm, who had kept the\r\ncommandments and loved his Maker, passed in glory to the Saints of\r\nPower. The morn of the Eternal Present dawned upon him, and the sublime\r\n'_vision in God_' was open before him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen were the artists summoned before the Throne. Awed yet enchanted,\r\nthey bowed before their Maker, with raised hands clasped in gratitude\r\nfor the happiness they had known on earth. Then spoke Angelo, the\r\nmusician:\r\n\r\n'Behold thy grateful children at thy feet, O Father of earth and heaven!\r\nWe truly repent of all we may have done amiss in Thy lower world. Thy\r\nheritage was very fair, and the exceeding Beauty thereof covered the\r\nEvil, and in all things were planted the germs of Good. 'Our prayer was\r\nin our work,' and all things spake to us of Thee, for the hand of a\r\nFather made all. Forgive us if we have loved life too well; we have\r\nalways felt that the rhythmed pulse of our own hearts throbbed but in\r\nobedience to Thy tuneful laws! Loving our fellow men, we have labored to\r\nawake them to a sense of Thy tenderness, O Creator of Love and of\r\nBeauty, so unsparingly casting the ever-new glories around them! Father,\r\nwe have loved Thee in thy glorious creation.\r\n\r\n\"For Thou lovest all things that are, and hatest none of the things that\r\nthou hast made, for thou didst not appoint or make anything hating it.\r\nFor He made the nations of the earth for health: and there is no poison\r\nof destruction in them, nor kingdom of hell upon earth.\r\n\r\n\"For justice is perpetual and immortal.'\r\n\r\n\"We have looked upon the rainbow, and blessed Him that made it: for it\r\nwas very beautiful in its brightness.'\r\n\r\n\"For by the greatness of the Beauty, and of the creature, the Creator of\r\nthem may be seen so as to be known thereby.'\r\n\r\n\"It is good to give praise to the Lord: to show forth thy loving\r\nkindness in the morning, and thy truth in the night;\r\n\r\n\"Upon an instrument of ten strings, upon the psaltery, upon the harp\r\nwith a solemn sound.\r\n\r\n\"For thou, Lord, hast made me glad through thy works, and in the works\r\nof thy hand I shall rejoice.'\r\n\r\n'Have mercy upon us for the sake of the Redeemer, whose Perfection\r\ncrowns the universe, who has not disdained to give Himself to us, and\r\nfor us: the chief among ten thousand, and altogether lovely. Mercy for\r\nourselves--and for those whom we have left on earth, we beseech Thee!'\r\n\r\nGently smiled the Virgin Mother, whose humble heart had cradled the\r\nEverlasting Love! 'All generations shall call her blessed,' for on that\r\ntender woman bosom rests that wondrous God-built arch spanning the awful\r\nChaim between the sinful human and the Perfect Infinite! 'For _He_ was\r\nborn of a Virgin.'\r\n\r\nThe heart of Anselm throbbed through his garments white and pure; he\r\nloved his brothers, and feared that human art would be deemed vain and\r\nworthless in heaven. _For the saints forget that God himself is the\r\nGreat Artist!_\r\n\r\nThen was there silence in heaven, and the brothers knelt before the\r\nThrone.\r\n\r\nThe Father spoke:\r\n\r\n'Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord. Enter into his gates\r\nwith thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise, be thankful unto\r\nhim, and bless his name: the Lion of the tribe of Judah hath conquered.\r\nHe will give to him that overcometh to eat of the Tree of Life, which is\r\nin the Paradise of God.'\r\n\r\nThe silence that ensued was the bliss of heaven!\r\n\r\nAs Rubi, the Angel of Beauty, advanced to greet the spirits whom he had\r\nleft on the confines of chaos, the triumphant song burst from the young\r\nchoir of angels: 'For they shall not hunger nor thirst any more; neither\r\nshall the sun fall on them or any heat. For the Lamb, which is in the\r\nmidst of the throne, shall rule them, and shall lead them to the\r\nfountains of the waters of life, and God shall wipe away all tears from\r\ntheir fives.'\r\n\r\nJoy! joy! for the soul of the musician! The heart of the Rose had broken\r\nwhile chanting the last Miserere, and she was again at his side to catch\r\nhis first Hosanna!\r\n\r\n'Angelo--Angelo--parting and death are only seeming!'\r\n\r\nTo the soul of the poet was given the highest theme, the splendor and\r\nlove of the Eternal City, and power to join the scribes of heaven. And\r\nthe painter looked upon the face of the Virgin, the strange lights, the\r\nforms of Cherubim and Seraphim, and the twelve gates and the golden\r\nstreets of that city; 'which needeth not sun or moon to shine in it, for\r\nthe glory of God hath enlightened it; and the Lamb is the light\r\nthereof.'\r\n\r\nWho can imagine that region of supernal splendor, 'whose glories eye\r\nhath not seen, ear hath not heard, neither hath it entered into the\r\nheart of man to conceive'?\r\n\r\nThe strings of Angelo's heaven harp quivered as though stirred by the\r\nbreath of God.\r\n\r\nThen did he first truly discern the _soul_ of that divine language whose\r\n_form_ he had made known on earth.\r\n\r\nThen arose 'as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice\r\nof many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying:\r\nAlleluia! for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.'\r\n\r\nLoud rang the heaven harps: 'Holy--Holy--Holy! To Him that sitteth on\r\nthe Throne, and to the Lamb, Benediction, and Honor, and Glory, and\r\nPower, forever and ever!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNUTTERED.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Said a poet, sighing lowly,\r\n                  As his life ebbed slowly, slowly,\r\n  And upon his pallid features shone the sun's last rosy light,\r\n                  Shedding there a radiance tender,\r\n                  Softened from the dazzling splendor\r\n  Of the burning clouds of sunset, gleaming in the west so bright,\r\n  Glancing redly, ere forever lost within the gloom of night:\r\n\r\n                  'Gold and crimson clouds of even,\r\n                  Kindling the blue vault of heaven,\r\n  Ye are types of airy fancies that within my spirit glow!\r\n                  Thou, O Night, so darkly glooming,\r\n                  And those brilliant tints entombing\r\n  In thy black and heavy shadows, thou art like this life of woe,\r\n  Prisoning all the glorious visions that still beat their wings to go!\r\n\r\n                  'Oh, what brilliancy and glory\r\n                  Had illumed my life's dull story,\r\n  Could those thoughts have found expression as within my soul they shone!\r\n                  But though there like jewels gleaming,\r\n                  And with golden splendor streaming,\r\n  Cold and dim their lustre faded, tarnished, like the sparkling stone\r\n  That, from out the blue waves taken, looks a pebble dull alone.\r\n                  'For within my heart forever\r\n                  Was a never-dying river,\r\n  Was a spring of deathless music welling from my deepest soul!\r\n                  And all Nature's deep intonings,\r\n                  Merry songs, and plaintive meanings,\r\n  Floated softly through my spirit, swelling where those bright waves stole,\r\n  Till the prisoning walls seemed powerless 'gainst that billowy rush and roll.\r\n\r\n                  'Oh, the surging thoughts and fancies;\r\n                  Oh, the wondrous, wild romances\r\n  That from morn till dewy twilight murmured through my haunted brain!\r\n                  Thoughts as sweet as summer roses,\r\n                  And with music's dreamiest closes,\r\n  Dying faintly into silence, from the full and ringing strain\r\n  That through all my spirit sounded with a rapture half of pain.\r\n\r\n                  'How I longed those words to utter\r\n                  That within my heart would flutter,\r\n  Beating wild against their prison, as its walls they'd burst in twain:\r\n                  But it broke not, throbbing only,\r\n                  Aching in a silence lonely,\r\n  Till my very life was flooded with a wild, delicious pain;\r\n  Kindled with a blaze illuming all the chambers of my brain!\r\n\r\n                  'And to me death had been glorious,\r\n                  If those burning words, victorious,\r\n  Had at last surged o'er their prison, bearing my departing soul!\r\n                  Gladly were my heart's blood given,\r\n                  If those bonds I might have riven;\r\n  If, with every crimson lifedrop that from out my full heart stole,\r\n  I might hear that swelling chorus upward in its glory roll.\r\n\r\n                  'Sad and low my heart is beating!\r\n                  Each pulsation still repeating\r\n  'All in vain those eager longings, all in vain that burning prayer.\r\n                  See the breezes, 'mid the bowers,\r\n                  Sigh above the fragrant flowers,\r\n  And from out those drooping roses, their heart-folded sweetness bear--\r\n  But no heaven-sent wind shall whisper thy soul-breathings to the air.'\r\n\r\n                  'But upon my darkened vision\r\n                  Comes a gleam of light Elysian;\r\n  And a seraph voice breathes softly--'Answered yet shall be that prayer!\r\n                  For the spirit crushed and broken\r\n                  By those burning words unspoken,\r\n  Soon shall hear them swelling, floating far upon the heavenly air,\r\n  And its deepest inmost visions shall have perfect utterance there!''\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM LILLY, ASTROLOGER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A cunning man, hight Sidrophel,\r\n  That deals in destiny's dark counsels,\r\n  And sage opinions of the moon sells,\r\n  To whom all people, far and near,\r\n  On deep importances repair.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Do not our great reformers use\r\n  This Sidrophel to forebode news?\r\n  To write of victories next year,\r\n  And castles taken yet i' the air?\r\n  Of battles fought at sea, and ships\r\n  Sunk two years hence--the great eclipse?\r\n  A total overthrow given the king\r\n  In Cornwall, horse and foot, next spring?'\r\n\r\nThus much, and more, wrote Butler in his 'Hudibras' of William Lilly,\r\nwho was famous in London during that eventful period of English history\r\nfrom the time of Charles I, onward through the Commonwealth and the\r\nProtectorate, to the Restoration: a time of civil commotions and wars,\r\nwhen political parties and religious sects, striving for mastery, or\r\nstruggling for existence, made the lives and estates of men insecure,\r\nand their outlook in many respects a troubled one. Lifelong connections\r\nof families and neighbors were then rudely severed, and doubt, distrust,\r\nand discontent filled all minds, or most. Of this widespread commotion\r\nLondon was the active centre; and there a judgment of God, called the\r\nplague, had, in the year 1625, desolated whole streets. The timid,\r\ntime-serving, faithless, a wavering host, peered anxiously into the\r\nfuture, eager to know what might be hidden there, so that they could\r\nshape their course accordingly for safety or for profit. Finding their\r\nown short vision inadequate, they turned for aid to the professional\r\nprophets of that troublous time--magicians who could call forth spirits\r\nand make them speak, or astrologers who could read the stars, and show\r\nhow the great Disposer of events could be forestalled. These discoverers\r\nof the hidden, disclosers of the future, though branded now as\r\nimpostors, were not therefore worse than their dupes; for in all ages\r\nthe two classes, deceivers and deceived, are essentially alike;\r\npositives and negatives of the same thing. 'Men are not deceived; they\r\ndeceive themselves.' Witness a great American nation, in these latter\r\ndays, electing its ablest man to its highest place, and choosing between\r\na Fremont and a Buchanan! But let us turn quickly to the seventeenth\r\ncentury again, and leave the nineteenth to its day of judgment.\r\n\r\nAmong the many astrologers dwelling in London at the time of which we\r\ntreat, William Lilly was the most famous; and his life being of great\r\ninterest to himself, he wrote an account of it for the instruction of\r\nmankind--or for some other purpose; and we will now get from it what we\r\nconveniently can.[1]\r\n\r\n'I was born,' says this renowned astrologer, 'in the county of\r\nLeicester, in an obscure town, in the northwest part thereof, called\r\nDiseworth, seven miles south of the town of Derby, one mile from Castle\r\nDonnington.' 'This town of Diseworth is divided into three parishes; one\r\npart belongs under Lockington, in which stands my father's house (over\r\nagainst the steeple), in which I was born' on the first day of May,\r\n1602. After this rather too minute account of his birthplace, Lilly\r\ntells us of his ancestors, substantial yeomen for many generations, who\r\n'had much free land and many houses in the town;' but all the family\r\nestates were 'sold by my grandfather and father, so that now our family\r\ndepends wholly on a college lease.' 'Of my infancy I can speak but\r\nlittle; only I do remember that in the fourth year of my age I had the\r\nmeasles.' 'My mother intended I should be a scholar from my infancy,\r\nseeing my father's backslidings in the world, and no hopes by husbandry\r\nto recruit a decayed estate.' Therefore, after some schooling at or near\r\nhome, the boy, when eleven years old, was sent to Ashby-de-la-Zouch,\r\nLeicester, to the school of Mr. John Brinsley, who 'was very severe in\r\nhis life and conversation, and did breed up many scholars for the\r\nuniversities; in religion he was a strict Puritan.' 'In the fourteenth\r\nyear of my age, about Michaelmas, I got a surfeit, and thereupon a\r\nfever, by eating beechnuts.' 'In the sixteenth year of my age I was\r\nexceedingly troubled in my dreams concerning my salvation and damnation,\r\nand also concerning the safety and destruction of my father and mother:\r\nin the nights I frequently wept and prayed, and mourned, for fear my\r\nsins might offend God.' 'In the seventeenth year of my age my mother\r\ndied.' The next year, 'by reason of my father's poverty, I was enforced\r\nto leave school, and so came home to my father's house, where I lived in\r\nmuch penury one year, and taught school one quarter of a year, until\r\nGod's providence provided better for me. For the last two years of my\r\nbeing at school I was of the highest form of the school, and chiefest of\r\nthat form. I could then speak Latin as well as English; could make\r\nextempore verses upon any theme.' 'If any scholars from remote schools\r\ncame to dispute, I was ringleader to dispute with them.' 'All and every\r\nof those scholars, who were of my form and standing, went to Cambridge,\r\nand proved excellent divines; only I, poor William Lilly, was not so\r\nhappy, fortune then frowning on my father's condition, he not in any\r\ncapacity to maintain me at the university.'\r\n\r\nSo this poor scholar, first of his class, bright visions of the\r\nuniversity, and of what might lie beyond, all fading into darkness, went\r\ndown to his father's house in the country, where his acquirements were\r\nuseless. He says: 'I could not work, drive plough, or endure any country\r\nlabor; my father oft would say, 'I was good for nothing,' and 'he was\r\nwilling to be rid of me.' A sorrowful time for the poor young fellow,\r\nwithout any outlook toward a better. But at last, one Samuel Smatty, an\r\nattorney, living in the neighborhood, took pity on the lad, and gave him\r\na letter to Gilbert Wright, of London, who wanted a youth who could read\r\nand write, to attend him. Thereupon Lilly, in a suit of fustian, with\r\nthis letter in his pocket, and ten shillings, given him by his friends,\r\ntook leave of his father, who was then in Leicester jail for debt, and\r\nset off for London with 'Bradshaw, the carrier.' He 'footed it all\r\nalong,' and was six days on the way; spending for food two shillings and\r\nsixpence, and nothing for lodgings; but he was in good heart, I think,\r\nfor almost the only joyous expression in his autobiography is this one,\r\nrelating to this time: 'Hark, how the wagons crack with their rich\r\nlading!'\r\n\r\nGilbert Wright, who had been 'servant to the Lady Pawlet in\r\nHertfordshire,' had married a widow with property, and lived afterward\r\n'on his annual rents;' or on his wife's, and 'was of no calling or\r\nprofession.' This man had real need of a servant who could read and\r\nwrite, for he himself could do neither; but he was, however, 'a man of\r\nexcellent natural parts, and would speak publicly upon any occasion very\r\nrationally and to the purpose.' Lilly was kindly received by Master\r\nWright, who found, it seems, employment enough for him. 'My work was to\r\ngo before my master to church; to attend my master when he went abroad;\r\nto make clean his shoes; sweep the street; help to drive bucks when he\r\nwashed; fetch water in a tub from the Thames--I have helped to carry\r\neighteen tubs of water in one morning;--weed the garden. All manner of\r\ndrudgery I willingly performed.'\r\n\r\nMrs. Wright, who brought money to her husband, brought also a jealous\r\ndisposition, and made his life uncomfortable. 'She was about seventy\r\nyears of age, he sixty-six,' 'yet was never any woman more jealous of a\r\nhusband than she!' She vexed more than one man, too, and her first\r\nhusband had temptations to cut his own throat and escape from trouble\r\nso; but he, as we shall learn by and by, got some relief otherwise, and\r\nlived till death came by better means.\r\n\r\nTally had difficulty in keeping on good terms 'with two such opposite\r\nnatures' as those of his master and mistress, that he managed it\r\nsomehow, and says: 'However, as to the things of this world, I had\r\nenough, and endured their discontents with much sereneness. My mistress\r\nwas very curious to know of such as were then called cunning, or wise\r\nmen, whether she should bury her husband. She frequently visited such\r\npersons, and this begot in me a little desire to learn something that\r\nway; but wanting money to buy books, I laid aside these notions, and\r\nendeavored to please both master and mistress.'\r\n\r\nThis mistress had a cancer in her left breast, and Lilly had much\r\nnoisome work to do for her; which he did faithfully and kindly. 'She was\r\nso fond of me in the time of her sickness, she would never permit me out\r\nof her chamber.' 'When my mistress died (1624) she had under her armhole\r\na small scarlet bag full of many things, which one that was there\r\ndelivered unto me. There were in this bag several sigils, some of\r\nJupiter in Trine; others of the nature of Venus; some of iron, and one\r\nof gold, of pure virgin gold, of the bigness of a thirty-three shilling\r\npiece of King James coin. In the circumference on one side was engraven,\r\n_Vicit Leo de Tribu Judæ Tetragrammation_~+~: within the middle there\r\nwas engraven a holy lamb. In the other circumference there was\r\n_Amraphel_, and three ~+ + +~. In the middle, _Sanctus Petrus_, _Alpha_\r\nand _Omega_.'\r\n\r\nThis sigil the woman got many years before of Dr. Samuel Foreman, a\r\nmagician or astrologer; the same who 'wrote in a book left behind him,'\r\n'This I made the devil write with his own hand, in Lambeth Fields, 1596,\r\nin June or July, as I now remember.' This sigil the woman got from the\r\ndoctor, who was evidently a foreman among liars, for her first husband,\r\nwho had been 'followed by a spirit which vocally and articulately\r\nprovoked him to cut his own throat.' Her husband, wearing this sigil\r\n'till he died, was never more troubled by spirits' of this kind of call;\r\nbut on the woman herself it seems to have failed of effect, for though\r\nshe too wore it till she died, she was continually tormented by an\r\nauthentic spirit of jealousy--a torment to herself and to her husband.\r\n\r\nAfter this mistress had gone, Lilly lived very comfortably, his 'master\r\nhaving a great affection' for him; and also a great confidence in him,\r\nit seems; for when the plague (1625) began to rage in London, the master\r\nwent for safety into Leicestershire, leaving Lilly and a fellow servant\r\nto keep the house, in which was much money and plate, belonging to his\r\nmaster and others. Lilly was faithful to his charge in this fearful\r\ntime, and kept himself cheerful by amusements. 'I bought a bass viol,\r\nand got a master to instruct me; the intervals of time I spent in\r\nbowling in Lincoln's Inn Fields with Watt, the cobbler, Dick, the\r\nblacksmith, and such-like companions.' Nor did he neglect more serious\r\nbusiness, but attended divine service at the church of St. Clement\r\nDanes, where two ministers died in this time; but the third, Mr.\r\nWhitacre, 'escaped not only then, but all contagion following,' though\r\nhe 'buried all manner of people, whether they died of the plague or\r\nnot,' and 'was given to drink, so that he seldom could preach more than\r\none quarter of an hour at a time.' This year of plague was indeed a\r\nfearful one in London, and Lilly says elsewhere, 'I do well remember\r\nthis accident, that going in July, 1625, about half an hour after six in\r\nthe morning, to St. Antholine's church, I met only three persons on the\r\nway, from my house over against Strand bridge, till I came there; so few\r\npeople were there alive and the streets so unfrequented.' 'About fifty\r\nthousand people died that year;' but Lilly escaped death, though his\r\n'conversation was daily with the infected.'[2]\r\n\r\nMaster Wright did not continue long a widower, but took to himself\r\nanother wife, and a younger, who was of 'brown ruddy complexion,' and of\r\nbetter disposition than her predecessor in the household. Master Wright\r\nwas probably a happy man for a time; but only for a short time; for in\r\nMay, 1627, he died, and the estate, by agreement of the parties in it,\r\nwas assigned to Lilly for payment of its debts. The trust was not\r\nmisplaced; the debts were all paid, and the remainder of the estate,\r\nexcept an annuity of twenty pounds, which his master had settled on\r\nLilly, he returned to the executors.\r\n\r\nMistress Wright, the widow, 'who had twice married old men,' had now\r\nmany suitors; 'old men, whom she declined; some gentlemen of decayed\r\nfortunes, whom she liked not, for she was covetous and sparing;'\r\n'however, all her talk was of husbands,' and, in short, William Lilly\r\nbecame the happy man; made happy within four months of the death of the\r\nold master. 'During all the time of her life, which was till October,\r\n1633, we lived very lovingly; I frequenting no company at all; my\r\nexercises were angling, in which I ever delighted; my companions, two\r\naged men.' 'I frequented lectures, and leaned in judgment to Puritanism;\r\nand in October, 1627, I was made free of the Salters' company of\r\nLondon.'\r\n\r\nUp to this time, therefore, the history of William Lilly, so far as he\r\nhas made it known, is briefly this: Born poor, the grandfather and\r\nfather having wasted the family estates, he was sent by his mother, who\r\nintended him from his infancy for a scholar, to the school of\r\nAshby-de-la-Zouch; where, at one time, he was in trouble about his soul\r\nand the souls of his parents; and he 'frequently wept, prayed, and\r\nmourned, for fear his sins might offend God.' But the mother died, the\r\nfather got into prison for debt, and poor Lilly, who had made himself\r\nthe best scholar in the school, could not go up to the university as he\r\nhad hoped to do, but after a wretched year at his father's house, where\r\nhe was accounted useless and an encumbrance, he had to become the\r\nservant of one who could neither read nor write, doing all kinds of\r\ndrudgery. Serving faithfully, the much-enduring young man won the love\r\nand confidence of the old master and mistress, and at last married the\r\nyoung widow, who was a wholesome-looking woman, of brown ruddy\r\ncomplexion, and had property, which served, among other things, to make\r\nLilly 'free of the Salters' company.' Not a bad history, certainly, if\r\nnot one of the best: he was a thriving young man, not a complaining one;\r\nbut one who accepted the conditions under which he was placed, and made\r\nthe best of them; which is what all young men ought to do.\r\n\r\nAnd now Lilly--being a man of some property and standing, without any\r\nprofession or regular business, but with an inclination to the occult\r\narts, begot in him probably by the folly of old Mistress Wright--tells\r\nus how he 'came to study astrology.' 'It happened on one Sunday, 1632,\r\nas myself and a justice of peace's clerk were, before service,\r\ndiscoursing of many things, he chanced to say that such a person was a\r\ngreat scholar; nay, so learned that he could make an almanac, which to\r\nme was strange: one speech begot another, till at last he said he could\r\nbring me acquainted with one Evans, who lived in Gunpowder alley, who\r\nformerly lived in Staffordshire, that was an excellent wise man, and\r\nstudied the black art. The same week (after) we went to see Mr. Evans.\r\nWhen we came to his house, he, having been drunk the night before, was\r\nupon his bed--if it be lawful to call that a bed whereon he lay.' 'He\r\nwas the most saturnine man my eyes ever beheld either before I practised\r\n(astrology) or since: of middle stature, broad forehead, beetle browed,\r\nthick shoulders, flat nosed, full lips, down looked, black, curling,\r\nstiff hair, splay footed;' 'much addicted to debauchery, and then very\r\nabusive and quarrelsome; seldom without a black eye, or one mischief or\r\nanother.' A very good description this, save that the shoulders of it\r\nare between the brow and nose: not a handsome man, certainly; a kind of\r\nwhite negro, we should say, and not the better for being white:\r\nnevertheless men of high rank came to see him, and readers who have made\r\nacquaintance with Sir Kenelm Digby will not be astonished to learn that\r\nhe was one of them. He came with Lord Bothwell, and 'desired Evans to\r\nshow them a spirit.' But 'after some time of invocation, Evans was taken\r\nout of the room, and carried into the fields near Battersea causeway,\r\nclose to the Thames:' taken by the spirits, because the magician 'had\r\nnot at the time of invocation made any suffumigation;' for spirits must\r\nalways be treated gingerly. 'Sir Kenelm Digby and Lord Bothwell went\r\nhome without any harm;' which was better than they deserved.\r\n\r\nLilly, after many lessons given him by this Evans, was doubtful about\r\nthe black art, as he might well be; but, he says, 'being now very\r\nmeanly introduced, I applied myself to study those books I had obtained,\r\nmany times twelve or fifteen or eighteen hours a day and night: I was\r\ncurious to discover whether there was any verity in the art or not.\r\nAstrology at this time, viz. 1633, was very rare in London; few\r\nprofessing it that understood anything thereof.' Lilly gives us next\r\nsome account of the astrologers of his time; but the reader need form no\r\nfurther acquaintance of this kind; acquaintance with Lilly, who was the\r\nbest of them, will be enough for him.\r\n\r\nIn October of this year, 1633, Lilly's wife died, and left him 'very\r\nnear to the value of one thousand pounds sterling'--all she had to\r\nleave. He continued a widower 'a whole year,' which he, as that phrase\r\nimplies, held to be a long time in such bereavement--and followed his\r\nstudies in astrology very diligently. So diligently that he soon had\r\nknowledge to impart to others, and he 'taught Sir George Knight\r\nastrology, that part which concerns sickness, wherein he so profited\r\nthat in two or three months he would give a very good discovery of any\r\ndisease only by his figures.'\r\n\r\nWith a new wife, which he got the next year (1634), Lilly had £500\r\nportion; but 'she was of the nature of Mars,' which is surely not a good\r\nnature in a wife. In that same year he, with some 'other gentlemen,'\r\nengaged in an adventure for hidden treasure: they 'played the hazel rod\r\nround about the cloyster,' and digged, in the place indicated, six feet\r\ndeep, till they came to a coffin; but they did not open it, for which\r\nthey were afterward regretful, thinking that _it_ probably contained the\r\ntreasure. Suddenly, while they were at this work, a great wind arose,\r\n'so high, so blustering, and loud,' that all were frightened, 'and knew\r\nnot what to think or do;' all save Lilly, who gave 'directions and\r\ncommands to dismiss the dæmons,' and then all became quiet again. These\r\ndoings Lilly did not approve, and says he 'could never again be induced\r\nto join in such kind of work.' He engaged, however, in another\r\ntransaction of still worse character, which seems to have been even\r\nmore unpleasant to him; for he says: 'After that I became melancholy,\r\nvery much afflicted with the hypochondriac melancholy, growing lean and\r\nspare, and every day worse; so that in the year 1635, my infirmity\r\ncontinuing and my acquaintance increasing, I resolved to live in the\r\ncountry, and in March and April, 1636, I removed my goods unto Hersham\r\n(Horsham in Sussex, thirty-six miles from London), where I continued\r\nuntil 1641, no notice being taken who or what I was:' and in this time\r\nhe burned some of his books, which treated of things he did not approve,\r\nand which he disliked to practise; for this man really had a conscience\r\nas good as the average, or even better: he was driven into solitude by\r\nthe reproaches of it--or, perhaps, by the scoldings of a wife who 'was\r\nof the nature of Mars.'\r\n\r\nThus far we have followed Lilly's account of himself closely, using\r\noften his own words, because they give a more correct idea of the man\r\nthan could be got from the words of another; but henceforth to the end,\r\nwe will skip much and be brief. This astrologer did not always rely on\r\nhis special art to discover things hidden, but used often quite ordinary\r\nmeans; sometimes such as are common to officers of detective police. His\r\nconfessions of doings in that kind are candid enough, and we must say of\r\nhis 'History of his Life and Times' that it is, on the whole, a simple,\r\ntruthful statement of facts; not an apology for a life at all; for he\r\nseldom attempts to excuse or justify his actions, but leaves a plain\r\nrecord with the reader for good or evil.\r\n\r\nA man, it is sometimes said, is to be judged by the company he keeps,\r\nand we will therefore say a few words of this astrologer's friends. Of\r\nmen like William Pennington, of Muncaster, in Cumberland, 'of good\r\nfamily and estate,' introduced to Lilly by David Ramsay, the king's\r\nclockmaker, in 1634, who are otherwise unknown to us, we will say\r\nnothing. But the reader surely knows something of Hugh Peters, the\r\nPuritan preacher--who could do other things as well as preach: with him\r\nLilly had 'much conference and some private discourses,' and once in the\r\nChristmas holidays, a time of leisure, Peters and the Lord Gray of Groby\r\ninvited him to Somerset House, and requested him to bring two of his\r\nalmanacs. At another time Peters took Lilly along with him into\r\nWestminster Hall 'to hear the king tried.' But the most influential\r\nfriend, perhaps, was Sir Bulstrode Whitlocke, a man well known to\r\nreaders of English history as very prominent in the time of the\r\nCommonwealth and Protectorate. He was high steward of Oxford, member of\r\nthe council of state, one of the keepers of the great seal, a man very\r\nlearned in the law, who made long discourses to Oliver Cromwell on the\r\nmatter of the kingship, and on other matters. He went to Sweden as\r\nCromwell's ambassador, and was one of the great men of that time, or one\r\nof the considerable men. Sir Bulstrode, according to Ashmole, was\r\nLilly's patron; and indeed the great man did befriend him long, and help\r\nhim out of difficulties. The acquaintance began in this wise: Sir\r\nBulstrode being sick, Mrs. Lisle, 'wife to John Lisle,' afterward one of\r\nthe keepers of the great seal, came to Lilly, bringing a specimen of the\r\nsick man. Whereupon the astrologer, having inspected the specimen, 'set\r\na figure,' and said, 'the sick for that time would recover, but by means\r\nof a surfeit would dangerously relapse within one month; which he did,\r\nby eating of trouts at Mr. Sands' house in Surrey.' Therefore, as there\r\ncould no longer be any doubt of Lilly's skill, he, at the time of Sir\r\nBulstrode's second sickness, was called to him daily; and though the\r\nfamily physician said 'there was no hope of recovery,' the astrologer\r\nsaid there was 'no danger of death,' and 'that he would be sufficiently\r\nwell in five or six weeks; and so he was.' This Mrs. Lisle, who brought\r\nthe specimen, being apparently one of Lilly's she friends, we will add\r\nthat she made herself remarkable by saying at the martyrdom of King\r\nCharles I, in 1648, that 'her blood leaped within her to see the tyrant\r\nfall.' For this, and for other things, the woman was finally beheaded;\r\nit being impossible otherwise to stop her tongue; and I have no tear for\r\nher.\r\n\r\nLilly's most intimate friend, however, was Elias Ashmole, Esq. Born in\r\n1617, the name for him agreed on among his friends was Thomas; but at\r\nthe baptismal font the godfather, 'by a more than ordinary impulse of\r\nspirit,' said Elias; and under that prophetic name the boy grew up to\r\nmanhood, and became for a time rather famous in high places. He was a\r\nlearned antiquary, and made a description of the consular and imperial\r\ncoins at Oxford, and presented it, in three folio volumes, to the\r\nlibrary there. He made also a catalogue and description of the king's\r\nmedals; a book on the Order of the Garter; a book entitled, _Fasciculus\r\nChemicus_, and another, _Theatrum Chemicum_. He published, moreover, a\r\nbook called 'The Way to Bliss;' but if he himself ever arrived at that\r\nthing, he found the way uncomfortable, if we may judge from his diary,\r\nhalf filled with record of his ailments, surfeits, and diseases, and of\r\nthe sweatings, purgings, and leechings consequent thereupon, or intended\r\nas preventives thereof. To one kind of bliss, however, he did certainly\r\nattain--that of high society; dining often with lords, earls, and dukes,\r\nbishops and archbishops, foreign envoys, ambassadors, and princes; and\r\nthey, many of them, came in turn, and dined with him, who had made a\r\nbook on the Order of the Garter, and who understood the art of dining.\r\nContinental kings sent to this man chains of gold, and his gracious\r\nmajesty, Charles II, was very gracious to him, and gave him fat offices,\r\nmostly sinecures: and over and above all he gave a pension. This world\r\nis a very remarkable one--especially remarkable in the upper crust of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nLilly's acquaintance with Ashmole began in 1646, and continued till\r\ndeath did them part in 1681. Through all these thirty-five years there\r\nwas a close intimacy, Ashmole being a frequent visitor at Lilly's house\r\nin the country, staying there often months at a time, and Lilly in\r\nreturn coming often to London, and staying weeks with his honored\r\nfriend--a kind of Damon and Pythias affair without the heroics. Ashmole,\r\nwe said, was famous in his time; but indeed he has a kind of fame now,\r\nand cannot soon be altogether forgotten, for he founded the Ashmolean\r\nMuseum at Oxford, and in the library there the curious can probably find\r\nall his books, and read them, if they will; but I, who have read one of\r\nthem, shall not seek for more.[3]\r\n\r\nBut indeed Lilly attracted the attention of Oliver Cromwell himself, and\r\nonce had an interview with him--a remarkably silent one. The occasion of\r\nit was as follows: The astrologer, in his _Martinus Anglicus_\r\n(astrological almanac) for 1650, had written that 'the Parliament should\r\nnot continue, but a new government should arise;' and the next year he\r\n'was so bold as to aver therein that the Parliament stood upon a\r\ntottering foundation, and that the commonalty and soldiers would join\r\ntogether against it.' These things, and others, published in _Anglicus_,\r\noffended the Presbyterians, and on motion of some one of them, it was\r\nordered that '_Anglicus_ should be inspected by the committee for\r\nplundered ministers;' and the next day thereafter Lilly was brought\r\nbefore the committee, which was very full that day (thirty-six in\r\nnumber), for the matter was an interesting one, whispered of before in\r\nprivate, and now made public by prophecy. The astrologer, by skilful\r\nmanagement of friends, and some lies of his own, got off without damage\r\nto himself.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the first day's proceedings in committee, as the\r\nsergeant-at-arms was carrying Lilly away, he was commanded to bring him\r\ninto the committee room again. 'Oliver Cromwell, lieutenant-general of\r\nthe army, having never seen me, caused me to be produced again, where he\r\nsteadfastly beheld me for a good space, and then I went with the\r\nmessenger.' This first meeting was, it appears, the only one, for Lilly\r\nspeaks of no other; but Cromwell spoke a good word for him that same\r\nnight, and was ever after rather friendly to him, or at least tolerant\r\nof him. The lieutenant-general, looking fixedly at this man 'for a good\r\nspace,' saw nothing very bad in him; and knowing that his prophecies\r\nfavored the good cause, he, a man of strong, practical sense, was\r\nwilling to let him work as one of the influences of that time.\r\n\r\nThis was not Lilly's only appearance before Parliament; sixteen years\r\nlater we shall find him there again; but of that at its time; and we\r\nwill look first at some of his doings in the interim. With another\r\ngeneral our astrologer had a meeting too, but with him--General\r\nFairfax--there was talk, not so full of meaning to me as the silence of\r\nCromwell. 'There being,' says Lilly, 'in those times, some smart\r\ndifference between the army and Parliament, the headquarters of the army\r\nwere at Windsor, whither I was carried with a coach and four horses, and\r\nJohn Boker (an astrologer) with me. We were welcomed thither, and\r\nfeasted in a garden where General Fairfax lodged. We were brought to the\r\ngeneral, who bid us kindly welcome to Windsor.' Lilly tells what Fairfax\r\nsaid, and what he himself said in reply; but if these speeches were all\r\nthat was there said and done, the coach and four, and the time spent,\r\nseem to me wasteful. The speeches ended, 'we departed, and went to visit\r\nMr. Peters (Hugh Peters), the minister, who lodged in the castle; whom\r\nwe found reading an idle pamphlet come from London that morning.' He\r\nsaid--what gives proof, if proof be needed, that there was idle talk\r\ncurrent in that time, as indeed there is in all times.\r\n\r\nOur astrologer, professing a high art, standing above the common level,\r\ndid not give 'up to party what was meant for mankind.' The stars look\r\ndown, from their high places, on sublunary things, with a sublime\r\nindifference; and he, their interpreter, was at the service of all\r\ncomers, or of all who could pay. Many came to him; among others came\r\n'Madam Whorwood,' from King Charles, who intended to escape from Hampton\r\nCourt, where he was held prisoner by the army. She came to inquire 'in\r\nwhat quarter of this nation he (the king) might be most safe?' Lilly,\r\nafter 'erection of his figure,' said, 'about twenty miles from London,\r\nand in Essex,' 'he might continue undisturbed;' but the poor king,\r\nmisguided by himself, or others, 'went away in the night time westward,\r\nand surrendered to Hammond in the Isle of Wight. Twice again, according\r\nto Lilly, Madam Whorwood came to him, asking advice and assistance for\r\nthe king. This Madam Whorwood I have not met with elsewhere in my\r\nreading, and the name may be a fictitious one; but that King Charles, in\r\nhis straits, sought aid of William Lilly, who by repute could read the\r\nstars, is not improbable. In 1648, Lilly gave to the council of state\r\n'some intelligence out of France,' which he got by means not\r\nastrological, or in any way supernatural; and the council thereupon gave\r\nhim 'in money fifty pounds, and a pension of one hundred pounds per\r\nannum,' which he received for two years, 'but no more.'\r\n\r\nSo Lilly, whose business as astrological prophet brought him into close\r\ncontact with many kinds of men--men of all parties and sects--went on\r\ngetting information of all, and by all kinds of means; and imparting it\r\nagain to all who had need; but always he had an eye to the 'main\r\nchance,' and provided well for himself. With each of his three wives he\r\ngot money. The second one, who, as we remember, 'was of the nature of\r\nMars,' died in February, 1654, and the bereaved man says that he\r\nthereupon 'shed no tear;' which we can well believe. Dry eyed, or with\r\nonly such moisture as comes of joy, he, within eight months after the\r\ndeparture of Mrs. Mars, took another to his bosom, one who, he says, 'is\r\nsignified in my nativity by Jupiter in Libra, and she is so totally in\r\nher conditions, to my great comfort.'\r\n\r\nAfter the Restoration, Lilly was apprehended and committed to the Gate\r\nHouse. 'I was had,' he says, 'into the guard room, which I thought to be\r\nhell: some therein were sleeping, others swearing, others smoking\r\ntobacco. In the chimney of the room I believe there were two bushels of\r\nbroken tobacco-pipes, and almost half one load of ashes.' A sad time and\r\nplace: but his 'old friend, Sir Edward Walker, garter king-at-arms,'\r\nmade interest for him in the right quarters, and he was released from\r\nthe place he 'thought to be hell.' In 1660 he sued out his pardon for\r\nall offences 'under the broad seal of England.'\r\n\r\nOf Lilly's religion (so called) there is not much to be said: in early\r\nlife he 'leaned to Puritanism,' as we have been told, and he probably\r\nleaned on that so long as he could find support in it; but after the\r\nRestoration (in 1663) he was made churchwarden of Walton-upon-Thames,\r\nand settled 'the affairs of that distracted parish' as well as he could;\r\nand upon leaving the place, 'forgave them seven pounds' which was due to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nSoon after this, when the great plague of 1665 came upon London, Lilly\r\ngave up business there and retired into the country to his wife and\r\nfamily, and continued there for the remainder of his life; going up to\r\nthe great city occasionally to visit his friends, or on calls to\r\nbusiness in his special line: one call from a high quarter came to him\r\nin this shape:\r\n\r\n\r\n'Monday, _22d October_, 1666.\r\n\r\nAt the committee appointed to inquire after the causes of the late\r\nfires:\r\n\r\n'_Ordered_, That Mr. Lilly attend the committee on Friday next, being\r\nthe 25th day of October, at two o'clock in the afternoon, in the\r\nspeaker's chamber, to answer such questions as shall be then and there\r\nasked him.\r\n\r\n'ROBERT BROOKE.'\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question before Parliament was in relation to the great fire in\r\nLondon: 'as to the causes of the late fire; whether there might be any\r\ndesign therein;' and Lilly was supposed to know something about that\r\nmatter, because he, in his book or pamphlet entitled 'Monarchy or no\r\nMonarchy,' published in 1651, had printed on page seventh a hieroglyphic\r\n'representing a great sickness and mortality, wherein you may see the\r\nrepresentation of people in their winding sheets, persons digging graves\r\nand sepultures, coffins, etc.;' and on another page another hieroglyphic\r\nrepresenting a fire: two twins topsy-turvy, and back to back, falling\r\nheadlong into a fire. 'The twins signify Gemini, a sign in astrology\r\nwhich rules London:' all around stand figures, male and female, pouring\r\nliquids (oil or water?) on the flames. When, therefore, the great fire\r\nof 1666 followed the plague of the preceding year, these hieroglyphics\r\nagain attracted attention, and the maker of them was called before\r\nParliament to declare if he, who had foreseen these events, could see\r\ninto them, and give any explanation of their causes. But Lilly was\r\nprudent: to the question, 'Did you foresee the year of the fire?' he\r\nreplied: 'I did not; nor was I desirous; of that I made no scrutiny.' As\r\nto the cause of the fire, he said: 'I have taken much pains in the\r\nsearch thereof, but cannot, or could not, give myself any the least\r\nsatisfaction therein: I conclude that it was only the finger of God;\r\nbut what instruments he used therein I am ignorant.'\r\n\r\nThat William Lilly, who, as we have seen, was twice called before\r\nParliament and questioned, attracted much attention elsewhere by his\r\nprophecies and publications, there can be no doubt; and his books found\r\nmany readers. Their titles, so far as known to us, are as follows:\r\n'Supernatural Insight;' 'The White King's Prophecy;' 'The Starry\r\nMessenger;' 'A Collection of Prophecies;' an introduction to astrology,\r\ncalled, 'Christian Astrology;' 'The World's Catastrophe;' 'The\r\nProphecies of Merlin, with a Key thereto;' 'Trithemius of the Government\r\nof the World by the Presiding Angels;' 'A Treatise of the Three Suns\r\nseen the preceding winter,' which was the winter of 1648; 'An\r\nAstronomical Judgment;' 'Annus Tenebrosus;' 'Merlinus Anglicus,' a kind\r\nof astrological almanac, published annually for many years, containing\r\nmany prophecies--a work which got extensive circulation, 'the Anglicus\r\nof 1658 being translated into the language spoken in Hamburg, printed\r\nand cried about the streets as it is in London;' and his 'Majesty of\r\nSweden,' of whom 'honorable mention' was made in Anglicus, sent to the\r\nauthor of it 'a gold chain and a medal worth about fifty pounds.'\r\n\r\nOf these books made by Lilly, we, having little knowledge, indeed none\r\nat all of the most of them, do not propose to speak; but one who has\r\nlooked into the 'Introduction to Astrology' can say that it has\r\nsomething of method and completeness, and he can readily conceive how\r\nLilly, studying astrology through long years very diligently, then\r\npractising it, instructing other men in it, writing books about it,\r\ncould have himself some kind of belief in it; such belief at least as\r\nmany men have in the business they study, practise, and get fame and\r\npudding by. Consider, too, how his belief in his art must have been\r\nstrengthened and confirmed by the belief of other men in it; able men of\r\nformer times, and respectable men of his own time. Indeed we will say of\r\nastrology generally that it is a much better thing than the spiritualism\r\nof this present day, with its idle rappings and silly mediums.\r\n\r\nWe have named some of Lilly's friends--those only of whom we happened to\r\nhave some knowledge; but he had many friends, or many acquaintances--a\r\nlarge circle of them. There were 'astrologers' feasts' in those days,\r\nheld monthly or oftener. Ashmole (called, by a more than ordinary\r\nimpulse of spirit, Elias) makes record in his Diary: 'Aug. 1, 1650, the\r\nastrologers' feast at Painter's Hall, where I dined;' 'Oct. 31, the\r\nastrologers' feast;' and other entries there are to the same effect.\r\nSome ten years after, Lilly seems to have had these festivals, or\r\nsimilar ones, in his own house; and on the 24th October, 1660, one\r\nPepys, well known to literary men, 'passed the evening at Lilly's house,\r\nwhere he had a club of his friends.'[4]\r\n\r\nThus far, namely, to the year 1666, Lilly brought the history of his\r\nlife: and in the continuation of it by another hand, we learn that in\r\nthe country at Horsham, near London, 'he betook himself to the study of\r\nphysic;' and in 1670, his old and influential friend, Mr. Ashmole, got\r\nfor him from the archbishop of Canterbury a license for the practice of\r\nit. 'Hereupon he began to practise more openly and with good success;\r\nand every Saturday rode to Kingston, where the poorer sort flocked to\r\nhim from several parts, and received much benefit by his advice and\r\nprescriptions, which he gave them freely and without money. From those\r\nthat were more able he now and then received a shilling, and sometimes a\r\nhalf crown, if they offered it to him; otherwise he received nothing;\r\nand in truth his charity toward poor people was very great, no less than\r\nthe care and pains he took in considering and weighing their particular\r\ncases, and applying proper remedies to their infirmities, which gained\r\nhim extraordinary credit and estimation.' So William Lilly lived at\r\nHorsham, publishing his 'astronomical judgments' yearly, and helping as\r\nhe could the poor there and in the neighborhood, till the 9th day of\r\nJune, 1681, when he died. The 'great agony' of his diseases, which were\r\ncomplicated, he bore 'without complaint.' 'Immediately before his breath\r\nwent from him, he sneezed three times;' which, we will hope, cleared his\r\nhead of some nonsense.\r\n\r\nIn the judgment of his contemporaries, this William Lilly, astrologer,\r\nwas, as we can see, 'a respectable man.' Such judgment, however, is\r\nnever conclusive; for the time clement is always a deceptive one; and,\r\nas all navigators know, the land which looms high in the atmosphere of\r\nto-day does often, in the clearer atmosphere of other days, prove to be\r\nas flat as a panecake: but we must say of Lilly, that though\r\nunfortunately an impostor, he was really rather above the common level\r\nof mankind--a little hillock, if only of conglomerate or pudding stone:\r\nfor, in his pamphlet entitled 'Observations on the Life and Times of\r\nCharles I,' where he, looking away from the stars and treating of the\r\npast, is more level to our judgment, he is still worth reading; and does\r\ntherein give a more impartial and correct character of that unhappy king\r\nthan can be found in any other contemporary writing; agreeing well with\r\nthe best judgments of this present time, and showing Lilly to be a man\r\nof ability above the common. On the whole, we will say of him, that he\r\nwas the product of a mother who was good for something, and of a father\r\nwho was good for nothing, or next to that; that with such parentage, and\r\nunder such circumstances as we have seen, he became an astrologer, the\r\nbest of his kind in that time.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to institute other moral reflections, and to pass\r\npositive judgment on the man: but instead thereof I will place here two\r\nquestions:\r\n\r\n_First_: Did William Lilly, in the eighteenth year of his age, need\r\nanything except a little cash capital to enable him to go up to the\r\nuniversity and become a respectable clergyman of the Church of England,\r\nor the minister of some dissenting congregation, if he had liked that\r\nbetter?\r\n\r\n_Second_: When this impostor and the clergymen, who as boys stood\r\ntogether in the same form of the school at Ashby-de-la-Zouch, come\r\ntogether before the judgment bar of the Most High, will the Great Judge\r\nsay to each of the clergymen: Come up hither; and to the impostor:\r\nDepart, thou cursed?\r\n\r\n'A fool,' it is said, 'may ask questions which wise men cannot answer;'\r\nand the writer, having done his part in asking, leaves the more\r\ndifficult part for the consideration of the reader.[5]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Lives of those eminent Antiquaries, Elias Ashmole,\r\nEsquire, and Mr. William Lilly, written by themselves; containing first,\r\nWilliam Lilly's History of his Life and Times, with Notes by Mr Ashmole;\r\nsecondly, Lilly's Life and Death of Charles I; and lastly, the Life of\r\nElias Ashmole, Esq., by way of Diary, etc. London, 1774.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Lilly's Life and Death of King Charles I.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The Lives of those eminent Antiquaries, Ellas Ashmole and\r\nWilliam Lilly, &c.

CON.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEFFERSON DAVIS--REPUDIATION, RECOGNITION, AND SLAVERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER NO. II, FROM HON. ROBERT J WALKER.\r\n\r\nLONDON, 10 HALF MOON STREET, PICCADILY}\r\n        _July 30th, 1863._            }\r\n\r\nIn my publication of the 1st inst., it was proved by the two letters of\r\nMr. Jefferson Dans of the 25th May, 1849, and 29th August, 1849, that he\r\nhad earnestly advocated the repudiation of the bonds of the State of\r\nMississippi issued to the Union Bank. It was then shown that the High\r\nCourt of Errors and Appeals of Mississippi, the tribunal designated by\r\nthe Constitution of the State, had _unanimously_ decided that these\r\nbonds were constitutional and valid, and that more than seven years\r\nthereafter, Mr. Jefferson Davis had nevertheless sustained the\r\nrepudiation of those bonds.\r\n\r\nIn his letter before quoted, of the 23d March last, Mr. Slidell, the\r\nminister of Jefferson Davis at Paris, says, 'There is a wide difference\r\nbetween these (Union) bonds and those of the Planters' Bank, for the\r\nrepudiation of which neither excuse nor palliation can be offered.' And\r\nyet I shall now proceed to prove, that Mr. Jefferson Davis did not only\r\n_palliate and excuse_, but justified the repudiation, in fact, of those\r\nbonds by the State of Mississippi. First, then, has Mississippi\r\nrepudiated those bonds? The principal and interest now due on those\r\nbonds exceed $5,000,000 (£1,000,000), and yet, for a quarter of a\r\ncentury, the State has not paid one dollar of principal or interest. 2.\r\nThe State, by act of the Legislature (ch. 17), referred the question of\r\ntaxation for the payment of those bonds to the vote of the people, and\r\ntheir decision was adverse. As there was no fund available for the\r\npayment, except one to be derived from taxation, this popular vote (to\r\nwhich the question was submitted by the Legislature) was a decision of\r\nthe State for repudiation, and against payment. 3. The State, at one\r\ntime (many years after the sale of the bonds), had made them receivable\r\nin purchase of certain State lands, but, as this was 'at three times its\r\ncurrent value,' as shown by the London _Times_, in its article\r\nheretofore quoted by me, this was only another form of repudiation. 4.\r\nWhen a few of the bondholders commenced taking small portions of these\r\nlands in payment, because they could get nothing else, the State\r\nrepealed the law (ch. 22), and provided no substitute. 5. The State, by\r\nlaw, deprived the bondholders of the stock of the Planters' Bank\r\n($2,000,000), and of the sinking fund pledged to the purchasers for the\r\nredemption of these bonds when they were sold by the State. Surely there\r\nis here ample evidence of repudiation and bad faith.\r\n\r\nThe bonds issued by the State of Mississippi to the Planters' Bank were\r\nbased upon a law of the State, and affirmed, by name, in a specific\r\nprovision of the State Constitution of 1832. The State, through its\r\nagent, received the money, and loaned it to the citizens of the State,\r\nand the validity of these obligations is conceded by Mr. Slidell and Mr.\r\nDavis.\r\n\r\nThese bonds were for $2,000,000, bearing an interest of six per cent.\r\nper annum, and were sold at a premium of 13-1/2 per cent For those\r\nbonds, besides the premium, the State received $2,000,000 of stock of\r\nthe Planters' Bank, upon which, up to 1838, the State realized ten per\r\ncent. dividends, being $200,000 per annum. In January, 1841, the\r\nLegislature of Mississippi _unanimously_ adopted resolutions affirming\r\nthe validity of these bonds, and the duty of the State to pay them.\r\n(Sen. Jour. 314.)\r\n\r\nIn his message to the Legislature of 1843, Governor Tucker says:\r\n\r\n     'On the 1st of January, 1838, the State held stock in the Planters'\r\n     Bank for $2,000,000, which stock had, prior to that time, yielded\r\n     to the State a dividend of $200,000 per annum. I found also the\r\n     first instalment of the bonds issued on account of the Planters'\r\n     Bank, $125,000, due and unpaid, as well as the interest for several\r\n     years on said bonds.' (Sen. Jour. 25.)\r\n\r\nThe Planters' Bank (as well as the State), by the express terms of the\r\nlaw, was bound for the principal and interest of these bonds. Now, in\r\n1839, Mississippi passed an act (Acts, ch. 42), 'to transfer the stock\r\nnow held by the State in the Planters' Bank, and invest the same in\r\nstock of the Mississippi Railroad Company.' By the first section of this\r\nact, the Governor was directed to subscribe for $2,000,000 of stock in\r\nthe railroad company for the State, and to pay for it by transferring to\r\nthe company the Planters' Bank stock, which had been secured to the\r\nState by the sale of the Planters' Bank bonds. The 10th section released\r\nthe Planters' Bank from the obligation to provide for the payment of\r\nthese bonds or interest. Some enlightened members, including Judge\r\nGholson, afterward of the Federal Court, protested against this act as\r\nunconstitutional, by impairing the obligation of contracts, and as a\r\nfraud on the bondholders.\r\n\r\nThey say in this protest:\r\n\r\n     'The money which paid for the stock proposed to be transferred from\r\n     the Planters' Bank to the Mississippi Railroad Company, was, under\r\n     the provisions of the charter, obtained by loans on the part of the\r\n     State, for the payment of which the stock, in addition to the faith\r\n     of the Government, was pledged to the holders of the bonds of the\r\n     State. By the terms of the contract between the commissioners on\r\n     the part of the State and the purchasers of the bonds, the interest\r\n     on the loans is required to be paid semiannually out of the\r\n     semiannual dividends _accruing upon the said stock_; and the\r\n     surplus of such dividends, after paying the said interest, is to be\r\n     converted into a _sinking fund_ for the payment and liquidation of\r\n     said loans. The bill, as the title purports, simply provides for\r\n     the transfer of the stock now held by the State in the Planters'\r\n     Bank, and that the same shall be invested in the stock of the\r\n     Mississippi Railroad Company, leading from Natchez to Canton, which\r\n     has banking privileges to twice the amount of capital stock paid\r\n     in. The transferring of the stock and dividend to another\r\n     irresponsible corporation, and the appropriation of the same to the\r\n     construction of a road, is a violation of and impairing the\r\n     obligation of the contract made and entered into with the\r\n     purchasers or holders of the bonds of the State, under a solemn act\r\n     of the Legislature. If it should be thought that a people, composed\r\n     of so much virtue, honor, and chivalry, as the noble and generous\r\n     Mississippians, would disdain, and consequently refrain, from\r\n     repealing or violating their plighted faith, it may be answered,\r\n     that the faith of the State, solemnly and sacredly pledged by an\r\n     act of the Legislature, with all the formality and solemnity of a\r\n     constitutional law, is violated by the provisions of this very bill\r\n     under consideration. The faith of the State is pledged to the\r\n     holders of the bonds, by the original and subsequent acts\r\n     incorporating the Planters' Bank, as solemnly as national or\r\n     legislative pledges can be made, that the stock and dividends\r\n     accruing thereon shall be faithfully appropriated to the redemption\r\n     and payment of said loans and all interest thereon, as they\r\n     respectively become due; the appropriation of this fund to an other\r\n     purpose is, therefore, a violation of the faith of the State.'\r\n     (House Jour. 443.)\r\n\r\nThus was it, that the stock of the bank, which for so many years had\r\nbeen yielding a dividend far exceeding the interest on the loan, and\r\nwhich stock had been pledged for the redemption of the loan, was\r\ndiverted to the building of a railroad, which never did or could yield a\r\nsingle dollar, and the company soon became insolvent. By another clause\r\nof this act of 1839, the Planters' Bank, which, by the loan act, was\r\nmade responsible (together with the State) for the payment of these\r\nbonds, was released from the obligation to make such payments.\r\n\r\nAnd now, what is the answer of Jefferson Davis on this subject? He says,\r\nin his letter of the 25th May, 1849, before quoted:\r\n\r\n     'A smaller amount is due for what are termed Planters' Bank bonds\r\n     of Mississippi. These evidences of debt, as well as the coupons\r\n     issued to cover accruing interest, are receivable for State lands,\r\n     and no one has a right to assume they will not be provided for\r\n     otherwise, by or before the date at which the whole debt becomes\r\n     due.'\r\n\r\nTo this the London _Times_ replied, in its editorial of the 13th July,\r\n1849, before quoted, as follows:\r\n\r\n     'The assurance in this statement that the Planters' Bank, or\r\n     non-repudiated bonds, are receivable for State lands, requires this\r\n     addition, which Mr. Jefferson Davis has omitted, that they are only\r\n     so receivable upon land being taken at three times its current\r\n     value. The affirmation afterward, that no one has a right to assume\r\n     that these bonds will not be fully provided for before the date at\r\n     which the principal falls due, is simply to be met by the fact,\r\n     that portions of them fell due in 1841 and 1846, and that on these,\r\n     as well as on all the rest, both principal and interest remain\r\n     wholly unpaid.'\r\n\r\nMr. Davis's 'palliation and excuse' for the non-payment of these bonds\r\nwas: 1st. That the principal was not due. If this were true, it would be\r\nno excuse for the non-payment of the semi-annual interest. But the\r\nstatement of Jefferson Davis as to the principal was not true, as shown\r\nby the _Times_, and as is clear upon the face of the law. Then, as to\r\nthe lands. The bonds, principal aid interest, were payable in money, and\r\nit was a clear case of repudiation to substitute lands. But when, as\r\nstated by the _Times_, this land was only receivable '_at three times\r\nits current value_,' Mr. Davis's defence of the repudiation of the\r\nPlanters' Bank bonds by Mississippi, is exposed in all its deformity.\r\nWhen, however, we reflect, as heretofore shown, that the law authorizing\r\nthe purchase of these lands by these bonds was repealed, and the\r\nbondholders left without any relief, and the proposition for taxation to\r\npay the bonds definitively rejected, it is difficult to imagine a case\r\nmore atrocious than this.\r\n\r\nThe whole debt, principal and interest, now due by the State of\r\nMississippi, including the Planters' and Union Bank bonds, exceeds\r\n$11,250,000 (£2,250,000). Not a dollar of principal or interest has been\r\npaid by the State for more than a fourth of a century on any of these\r\nbonds. The repudiation is complete and final, so long as slavery exists\r\nin Mississippi. Now, would it not seem reasonable that, before\r\nMississippi and the other Confederate States, including Florida and\r\nArkansas, ask another loan from Europe, they should first make some\r\nprovision for debts now due, or, at least, manifest a disposition to\r\nmake some arrangement for it at some future period. If a debtor fails to\r\nmeet his engagements, especially if he repudiates them on false and\r\nfraudulent pretexts, he can borrow no more money, and the same rule\r\nsurely should apply to states or nations. Nor can any pledge of property\r\nnot in possession of such a borrower, or, if so, not placed in the hands\r\nof the lender, change the position. It is (even if the power to pay\r\nexists) still a question of good faith, and where that has been so often\r\nviolated, all subsequent pledges or promises should be regarded as\r\nutterly worthless.\r\n\r\nThe _Times_, in reference to the repudiation of its Union Bank bonds by\r\nMississippi, and the justification of that act by Jefferson Davis, says:\r\n\r\n     'Let it circulate throughout Europe that a member of the United\r\n     States Senate in 1849 has openly proclaimed, that at a recent\r\n     period the Governor and legislative assemblies of his own State\r\n     deliberately issued fraudulent bonds for five millions of dollars\r\n     to 'sustain the credit of a rickety bank;' that, the bonds in\r\n     question having been hypothecated abroad to innocent holders, such\r\n     holders have not only no claim against the community by whose\r\n     executive and representatives this act was committed, but that they\r\n     are to be taunted for appealing to the verdict of the civilized\r\n     world rather than to the judgment of the legal officers of the\r\n     State by whose functionaries they have been already robbed; and\r\n     that the ruin of toil-worn men, of women, of widows, and of\r\n     children, and the 'crocodile tears' which that ruin has occasioned,\r\n     is a subject of jest on the part of those by whom it has been\r\n     accomplished; and then let it be asked if any foreigner ever penned\r\n     a libel on the American character equal to that against the people\r\n     of Mississippi by their own Senator.'\r\n\r\nSuch was the opinion then expressed by the London _Times_ of Jefferson\r\nDavis and of the repudiation advocated by him. It was denounced as\r\n_robbery_, 'the ruin of toil-worn men, of women, of widows, and of\r\nchildren.' And what is to be thought of the '_faith_' of a so-called\r\nGovernment, which has chosen this repudiator as their chief, and what of\r\nthe value of the Confederate bonds now issued by him? Why, the legal\r\ntender notes of the so-called Confederate Government, fundable in a\r\nstock bearing eight per cent, interest, is now worth in gold at their\r\nown capital of Richmond, less than ten cents on the dollar (2_s._, on\r\nthe pound), whilst in two thirds of their territory such notes are\r\nutterly worthless; and it is TREASON for any citizen of the\r\nUnited States, North or South, or any ALIEN resident there, to\r\ndeal in them, or in Confederate bonds, or in the cotton pledged for\r\ntheir payment. No form of Confederate bonds, or notes, or stock, will\r\never be recognized by the Government of the United States, and the\r\ncotton pledged by slaveholding traitors for the payment of the\r\nConfederate bonds is all forfeited for treason, and confiscated to the\r\nFederal Government by act of Congress. As our armies advance, this\r\ncotton is either burned by the retreating rebel troops, or seized by our\r\nforces, and shipped and sold from time to time, for the benefit of the\r\nFederal Government. By reference to the census of 1860, it will be seen\r\nthat three fourths of the whole cotton crop was raised in States (now\r\nheld by the Federal army and navy) touching the Mississippi and its\r\ntributaries, and all the other ports are either actually held or\r\nblockaded by the Federal forces. The traitor pledge of this cotton is,\r\nthen, wholly unavailing; the bonds are utterly worthless; they could not\r\nbe sold at any price in the United States, and those who force them on\r\nthe London market, in the language of the _Times_, before quoted, will\r\nonly accomplish '_the ruin of toil-worn, men, of women, of widows, and\r\nof children_.'\r\n\r\nBut the advocacy of repudiation by Jefferson Davis has not been confined\r\nto his own State, as I shall proceed to demonstrate in my next letter.\r\n\r\nR.J. WALKER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIARY OF FRANCES KRASINSKA;\r\n\r\nOR, LIFE IN POLAND DURING THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY,\r\n\r\n\r\nTuesday, _March 19th_.\r\n\r\nThe Prince and Princess Lubomirski left us about half an hour ago; they\r\nhad decided upon going yesterday, but my father told them that Monday\r\nwas an unfortunate day, and fearing that this argument would not possess\r\nsufficient weight, he ordered the wheels to be taken off their carriage.\r\n\r\nThey overwhelmed me with kindness during their sojourn in the castle;\r\nthe princess, especially, treated me with great affability. Both she and\r\nthe prince take a deep interest in my future lot; they endeavored to\r\npersuade my parents to send me to Warsaw to finish my education.\r\n\r\nA foreigner, Miss Strumle, who, however, receives universally the title\r\nof madame, has recently opened a young ladies' boarding school in\r\nWarsaw. This school enjoys a high reputation, and all the young ladies\r\nof distinction are sent there to finish their education. It is the same\r\nfor a young lady to have been some time at Madame Strumle's as for a\r\nyoung gentlemen to have been at Luneville. The prince palatine advised\r\nmy mother to send me for a year to Madame Strumle. My parents prefer the\r\nSisters of the Holy Sacrament; they say that nothing can be better than\r\na convent.\r\n\r\nI do not know what will be their final decision, but I feel restless and\r\nagitated. I no longer find pleasure in my reading; my work is tedious to\r\nme, and not so well executed as formerly; the future occupies my mind\r\nmuch more than the present; in short, I am in a constant state of\r\nexcitement, as if awaiting some great event. Since the visit of the\r\nprince and princess I have an entirely different opinion of myself, and\r\nI am by no means so happy as I was before.... In truth, I no longer\r\nunderstand myself.\r\n\r\n\r\nSunday, _March 24th_.\r\n\r\nAh I God be praised, my suspense is over, and we leave day after\r\nto-morrow for Warsaw. My parents have been suddenly called there on\r\nmatters of business connected with the recent death of my uncle, Blaise\r\nKrasinski, who has left a large fortune and no children. I do not yet\r\nknow whether I am to be placed at a boarding school or not, but I\r\nbelieve it will be a long time before I return to Maleszow.\r\n\r\nAh! how happy the idea of this journey makes me! We will go a little out\r\nof our way, that we may stop at Sulgostow. Her ladyship the starostine\r\nhas at length, after a very agreeable tour, returned to her palace. The\r\nstarost has introduced her to all his cousins, friends, and neighbors;\r\nshe was everywhere admirably received, and will now settle down in her\r\nown mansion, at which prospect she is very well pleased; she has all the\r\nnecessary qualifications for becoming a good housekeeper. The Palatine\r\nSwidzinski spoke of her so affectionately in one of his letters that my\r\nparents wept hot tears, but tears of joy, so sweet and go rare. Barbara\r\nhas always been a source of happiness to her parents.\r\n\r\n\r\nWarsaw, Sunday, _April 7th_.\r\n\r\nI can scarcely believe it, but here I am fairly installed in Madame\r\nStrumle's famous boarding school. The princess palatine's advice has\r\nprevailed, and Madame Strumle has received the preference over the\r\nSisters of the Holy Sacrament. God be praised, for I really was very\r\nanxious to come here. I received a most flattering reception.\r\n\r\nOn our way to Warsaw we stopped at Sulgustow. We found her ladyship the\r\nstarostine gay and most hospitable; the presence of our dear parents\r\nfilled the measure of her happiness. She assured me that the delight of\r\nreceiving one's parents in one's own house could be neither expressed\r\nnor understood. 'You must yourself experience it,' added she, 'before\r\nyou can form any idea of it.'\r\n\r\nOn the table were all the dishes, confections, and beverages preferred\r\nby our parents. Barbara forgot nothing which could be agreeable to them,\r\nand the starost aided her wonderfully in all her efforts. My mother\r\nremarked that Barbara was still better since her marriage than before,\r\nto which the starost replied:\r\n\r\n'Indeed, she is no better, for thus did I receive her from the hands of\r\nyour highnesses. But she gladly profits by the present opportunity to\r\ntestify her gratitude; she shows here those lovely and precious\r\nqualities which you have cultivated in her soul, and during the past\r\nthree days she has been for her parents what she is every day for me.'\r\n\r\nThere was no flattery in what the starost said--it came really from his\r\nheart. He adores Barbara, and she respects, honors, and obeys him as if\r\nhe were her father.\r\n\r\nShe understands perfectly the whole management of a household, and does\r\nthe honors of her mansion most gracefully. Every one praises her, and\r\nthe young ladies and waiting women who followed her from Maleszow are\r\ndelighted with their new position.\r\n\r\nMy parents regretted the necessity of parting from their daughter; they\r\nwould willingly have remained longer; but I must confess I was very\r\nanxious to see Warsaw, and was charmed when they received letters\r\nobliging them to hasten their departure.\r\n\r\nIt was really a true instinct which gave me a preference for this place.\r\nI study well, and must improve. My education will be complete, and I may\r\nperhaps become a superior woman, as I have always desired to do; but I\r\nneed much study and close application to bring me to that point; above\r\nall, must I chain my wandering fancies, and not suffer them to stray\r\nabout so vaguely as I have hitherto done.\r\n\r\nYesterday my mother came to take me to church. I made my confession, and\r\ncommuned for the intention of using well the new acquirements which I\r\nhave now the opportunity of making.\r\n\r\nWhen I am well established here, I will write in my journal every day as\r\nI did at Maleszow; but I am still in a state of excitement from all I\r\nhave seen, and I must first become better acquainted with my new\r\ndwelling.\r\n\r\n\r\nWednesday, _April 17th_.\r\n\r\nI am already quite familiar with all the regulations of the school. I am\r\nvery well pleased with Madame Strumle; she has excellent manners, and is\r\nvery kind to me. I might perhaps regret our court, the magnificence,\r\nbustle, and gayety of our castle, but there comes a time for everything,\r\nand we live here very happily and comfortably.\r\n\r\nThat which seems most strange and entirely new to me is, that there is\r\nnot even a little boy in the house, no men servants, women always, and\r\nonly women; they wait upon us even at table.\r\n\r\nThere are about fifteen boarders, all young, and belonging to the best\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\nEvery one speaks highly of Miss Marianne, the Starost Swidzinski's\r\nsister, now married to the Castellan of Polaniec; she spent two years at\r\nthe school, and has left an ineffaceable impression in the hearts of\r\nMadame Strumle and her young companions. They say she was very\r\naccomplished, very good and sensible, very gay, and very studious.\r\n\r\nMy parents, after having made a thorough examination of the school, felt\r\nquite satisfied; and truly they might well be so, for no one could be\r\nmore securely guarded in a convent than here. Madame keeps the key of\r\nthe front door always in her pocket; no one can go out or come in\r\nwithout her knowledge, and were it not for two or three aged masters of\r\nmusic and the languages, we might be in danger of forgetting the very\r\nexistence of _man_-kind.\r\n\r\nIt is expressly forbidden to receive visits even from one's male cousins\r\nwithin the walls of the school. The dancing master desired that the\r\nyoung potockis should come and learn quadrilles with their sisters and\r\nmyself, but madame rejected this proposition at once, saying, 'These\r\ngentlemen are not the brothers of all my boarders, and I cannot permit\r\nthem to enter my school.'\r\n\r\nWe have masters in French and German, as also in drawing, music, and\r\nembroidery. We learn music on a fine piano of five octaves and a half.\r\nWhat an improvement on that of Maleszow! Some of the scholars play\r\npolonaises very well, but not by rote; they read them from the notes. My\r\nmaster tells me that in six months I will have reached this perfection;\r\nbut then I already had some ideas of music when I came.\r\n\r\nI draw quite well from the patterns set before me, but ere I proceed any\r\nfurther, I wish to paint a tree in oil colors. On one of the branches I\r\nwill hang a garland of flowers, encircling the cypher of my parents, and\r\nwill thus testify to them my gratitude for all they have done for me,\r\nand especially for the care they have bestowed upon my education.\r\n\r\nThe young Princess Sapieha, who has been here a year, is at present\r\nemployed upon such a picture, and I envy her her pleasure every time my\r\neyes fall upon the work.\r\n\r\nWhat a fine effect my picture will make in our hall at Maleszow, beneath\r\nthe portrait of our good uncle, the Bishop of Kamieniec!\r\n\r\nOur dancing master, besides the minuet and quadrilles, teaches us to\r\nwalk and courtesy gracefully. To tell the truth, I was so ignorant when\r\nI came, that I knew but one mode of making a salutation; but there are\r\nseveral kinds, which must be employed toward personages of different\r\nranks; one for the king, another for the princes of the blood, and still\r\nanother for lords and ladies of rank.\r\n\r\nI learned first how to salute the prince royal, and succeeded quite\r\nwell; some day, perhaps, this knowledge may be useful to me.\r\n\r\nMy lessons follow one another regularly, and I am so anxious to learn\r\nthat the time passes rapidly and agreeably.\r\n\r\nMy mother is very much occupied with family affairs, and has been only\r\nonce to see me.\r\n\r\nWhen I first entered the school, everything surprised me, but what\r\nseemed to me most strange was that I was continually reproved, and even\r\nobliged to undergo real penance. An iron cross was placed at my back to\r\nmake me hold myself upright, and my limbs were enclosed in a kind of\r\nwooden box, to straighten them. I must however think that they were\r\nalready quite straight enough. All that was not very amusing for me, who\r\nthought myself already a young lady. Since Barbara's marriage I had\r\nmyself been asked in marriage, and the prince palatine had not treated\r\nme as if I were a child!\r\n\r\nMadame Strumle has commanded me to omit in future these words from my\r\nprayers: 'O my God, give me a good husband,' and to say instead, 'Give\r\nme the grace to profit by the good education I am receiving.'\r\n\r\nOne must here work continually, or think of one's work, and of nothing\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nSunday, _April 28th_.\r\n\r\nI have been nearly three weeks at Madame Strumle's school, and my poor\r\njournal has been quite neglected during all that time; but the\r\nuniformity of my life, these monotonous hours, all passed in the\r\nconstant repetition of the same occupations, afford no matter for\r\ninteresting details or descriptions.\r\n\r\nAt this very moment, when I hold the pen in my hand, I am ready to lay\r\nit down, so great is the poverty of my observations.\r\n\r\nMy parents will soon leave. The princess palatiness has honored me with\r\na visit; she remarked that my carriage was much improved. My masters are\r\nall satisfied with the closeness of my application. Madame is especially\r\nkind to me, and my companions are polite and friendly.... But is all\r\nthis worth the trouble of writing?\r\n\r\nI sometimes fancy that I am not really in Warsaw, so ignorant am I with\r\nregard to all political events. I have seen neither the king nor the\r\nroyal family. At Maleszow we at least hear the news, and occasionally\r\nsee Borne distinguished men.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Courland is absent, and will not return for some time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSunday, _June 9th_\r\n\r\nIf I were to live forever in this school, I should give up writing in my\r\njournal, and it really serves one very valuable purpose; for I find I am\r\nin great danger of forgetting Polish. With the exception of the letters\r\nI write to my parents, and the few words I say to my maid, I always\r\nwrite and speak French.\r\n\r\nI progress in all my studies, and if I am sometimes melancholy, at least\r\nmy time is not lost.\r\n\r\nThe princess palatiness has again been to see me. A month had passed\r\nsince her last visit; she found me considerably taller, and was kind\r\nenough to praise my manners and bearing.\r\n\r\nI am the tallest of all our boarders, and it really pleases me\r\nexceedingly to find that my waist is not quite a half yard round.\r\n\r\nSummer has come, the fine weather has returned, but I cannot go out--a\r\nprivation which is really quite vexatious. Ah! how I wish I were a\r\nlittle bird! I would fly away, far away--and then I would return to my\r\ncage.\r\n\r\nBut my days and my nights must all be spent in this dull house and in\r\nthis ugly street; I believe that Cooper street (ulika Bednarska) is the\r\ndarkest, dingiest, and dirtiest street in Warsaw. God willing, next year\r\nI shall be no longer here.\r\n\r\n\r\nFriday, _July 28th_.\r\n\r\nLabor has at least the good quality of making the time pass more\r\nrapidly; our days vanish one by one, without distractions or news from\r\nwithout.\r\n\r\nI just now felt a desire to write in my journal, and when I consulted\r\nthe almanac to find out the day of the month, I was quite surprised to\r\nfind that seven whole weeks had passed since I had written a single word\r\nin my poor diary.\r\n\r\nThis day certainly deserves to be noted down, for never since I was born\r\ndid such a thing happen to me as I experienced this morning. I received\r\na letter by the mail, and the world is no longer ignorant that the\r\nCountess Frances Krasinska is now living in Warsaw! I danced with joy\r\nwhen I saw my letter, my own letter! It came from her ladyship, the\r\nStarostine Swidzinska; I shall keep it as a precious and delightful\r\nremembrance. My sister writes to me that she is quite well, and happy\r\nbeyond all I can imagine; she was kind enough to send me four gold\r\nducats, which she has saved from her own private purse.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in my life I have money to spend as I will, which\r\ngives me great pleasure. With the money came the desire to spend, and a\r\nvariety of projects; it seemed to me as if I could buy the whole city.\r\n\r\nThanks to my parents, I need nothing, and I will buy nothing for myself;\r\nbut I would have liked to leave a pretty remembrance to each of my\r\ncompanions, a gold ring, for example; but madame quite distressed me by\r\ntelling me that my four ducats would only buy four rings-a real\r\naffliction to me, who had hope to purchase, besides the rings, a blonde\r\nmantle for Madame Strumle herself.... All my projects are overturned; I\r\nhave learned that the mantle will cost at least a hundred ducats, and\r\nhave thence determined to give one ducat to the parish church, to have a\r\nmass said in the chapel of Jesus to draw the blessing of Heaven upon the\r\naffairs now occupying my parents, and for the continuation of the\r\nhappiness of her ladyship the starostine. I will have another ducat\r\nchanged into small coin, to be distributed among all the servants in the\r\nhouse; there will still remain two ducats, which will buy a charming\r\ncollation for my companions on Sunday next. We will have coffee, an\r\nexcellent beverage, which we never see here, cakes, and fruit. Madame\r\nStrumle willingly consented to this last project.\r\n\r\nMay God reward my dear starostine for the happiness she has bestowed\r\nupon me! There can be no greater pleasure than that of making presents\r\nand regaling one's friends. If I am anxious to have a husband richer\r\nthan I am myself, it is solely that I may be very generous.\r\n\r\nI am not losing my time; I improve daily. I can already play several\r\nminuets and cotillons from the notes, and will soon learn a polonaise.\r\nThe most fashionable one just now has a very strange name; it is called\r\nthe Thousand Fiends.\r\n\r\nIn one month more I shall begin my tree in oil colors, with its\r\nallegoric garland.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding my more serious studies, I by no means neglect my little\r\nfeminine occupations. I am embroidering on canvas a huntsman carrying a\r\ngun, and holding his hound by a leash.\r\n\r\nI read a great deal, I write under dictation, I copy good works, an\r\nexcellent method of forming one's own style. I speak French quite as\r\nwell as Polish, perhaps even better; in short, I think I will soon be\r\nfitted to make my appearance in the best society.\r\n\r\nAs for dancing, I need scarcely say that that progresses wonderfully; my\r\nmaster, who has no reason to flatter me, assures me that in all Warsaw\r\nno one dances better than I do.\r\n\r\nI occasionally visit the Prince and Princess Lubomirski, but at times\r\nwhen they have no company. I always hear there many agreeable and\r\nflattering things, especially from the prince. He is desirous that I\r\nshould leave school now, but the princess and my parents wish me to\r\nremain here during the winter. It is now only the end of July! How many\r\nhours and days must pass before the winter sets in! Will that time ever\r\ncome?\r\n\r\n\r\nThursday, _December 26th_.\r\n\r\nFinally, God be praised, the time has come for leaving school; a new\r\nexistence is opening before me; my journal will be overflowing, and I\r\nshall have no lack of matter, but plenty of charming things to say.\r\n\r\nThe prince and princess are so kind to me; they have obtained permission\r\nfrom my parents for me to pass the winter with them, and they will\r\nintroduce me into society. I shall leave this place day after to-morrow,\r\nand will reside with the Princess Lubomirska. I am quite sorry to part\r\nfrom Madame Strumle and my companions, to many of whom I am sincerely\r\nattached, but my joy is greater than my sorrow, for I shall see the\r\nworld, and fly away from this narrow cage.\r\n\r\nI shall be taken to court and presented to the king and the royal\r\nfamily; the Duke of Courland is expected daily; I shall see him at last!\r\n\r\nThe days have become intolerably long since I knew I was to leave\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n\r\nWARSAW, Saturday, _December 28th, 1759_.\r\n\r\nNever, never can I forget this day. The Princess Lubomirska came for me\r\nquite early. I bade adieu to Madame Strumle and my companions. I was\r\nglad to go, and yet I wept when I parted from them!\r\n\r\nBefore going to her own house, the princess took me to church; but I\r\ncould scarcely force my recollection; there was a whole future in my\r\nbrain, a whole world in my thoughts.\r\n\r\nI am now established with the princess; her palace is situated in the\r\nquarter named after Cracow, nearly opposite to the residence of the\r\nPrince Palatine of Red-Russia, Czartoryski.\r\n\r\nThe palace in which we live is not very large, but very elegant; the\r\nwindows upon one side overlook the Vistula and a handsome garden. My\r\nchamber is delightful, and will be still more agreeable in summer; it\r\ncommunicates on the right with the apartments of the princess, and on\r\nthe left with my waiting maid's room.\r\n\r\nThe tailor came yesterday to take my measure; he is to make me several\r\ndresses. I do not know what they will be, as the princess has ordered\r\nthem without consulting my taste. She inspires me with so much respect,\r\nor perhaps awe, that I do not venture to ask her the least question. I\r\nam much less afraid of the prince; his manners are so gentle and\r\nengaging. He has gone to Bialystok, where he expects to meet the Duke of\r\nCourland; he is in high favor with the duke.\r\n\r\nWe are to make some visits to-morrow, when the princess will introduce\r\nme into some of the most distinguished houses; one must thus make one's\r\nappearance, if one desires to be invited to balls and parties. I am\r\nglad, and yet I am a little frightened at the idea of these visits: I\r\nshall be so looked at, perhaps criticized; however, I shall see many new\r\nthings and will have much to observe, which thought affords me much\r\nconsolation in my new and trying position.\r\n\r\nSunday, _December 29th_.\r\n\r\nAt least, now I have some news to tell, and my journal will no longer be\r\nso dry and uninteresting. The prince royal, accompanied by the prince\r\npalatine, arrived yesterday about one o'clock. Indeed I am quite\r\nconfused by the palatine's overwhelming kindness; he received me as if I\r\nhad been his daughter, and there is no kind of friendship or interest\r\nwhich he has not testified toward me.\r\n\r\nWe accomplished our visits and went to about fifteen different houses,\r\nbut were not everywhere admitted. At the French and Spanish ambassadors'\r\nand the prince primate's, etc., the princess merely left cards.\r\n\r\nOur first visit was to Madame Humiecka, wife of the swordbearer to the\r\ncrown; this lady is my aunt. We then went to see the Princess\r\nLubomirska, wife of the general of the advance guard of the royal\r\narmies; she is a full cousin to the princess palatine. She was born a\r\nPrincess Czartoryska, is very young and very beautiful; she holds the\r\nfirst rank among the younger ladies, and loves passionately everything\r\nFrench. I am so glad I am a proficient in the French language; besides\r\nbeing very useful, it will cause me to be much more sought after in\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nFrench is here spoken in nearly all the more distinguished houses; only\r\nthe older men retain the tiresome custom of mingling Latin in their\r\nconversation; the young people avoid this pedantry and speak French,\r\nwhich is much better; at least, I can understand them, which I cannot\r\nthe others.\r\n\r\nWe also went to see the wife of the Grand-General Branicki. Her husband\r\nis one of the most wealthy lords of Poland, but is not very favorably\r\nregarded at court.\r\n\r\nWe then visited the Princess Czartoryska, Palatiness of Red-Russia. The\r\nconversation there was held entirely in Polish; she is quite aged, and\r\nconsequently no admirer of new fashions. She introduced to us her only\r\nson, a very handsome young man, with polished and elegant manners; he\r\noverwhelmed me with the most graceful compliments. This visit was more\r\nagreeable than any of the others. But no--I think I was quite as much\r\npleased at the palace of the Castellane of Cracow, Poniatowska. She is\r\na very superior person; she talks a great deal, it is true, but then she\r\nspeaks with enthusiasm and in a very interesting manner. We found her\r\nquite elated with the pleasure of welcoming her son after a long\r\nabsence. Many think that this much-loved son may one day be king of\r\nPoland; I do not believe that will ever be, but I did not the less\r\nexamine him with great attention. I frankly confess that I was not\r\npleased with him, and yet he is handsome and amiable; but he has a kind\r\nof stiffness in his manners, a pretension to dignity and to airs of\r\ngrandeur, which injure his bearing.\r\n\r\nI must not forget, in enumerating our visits, to mention that paid to\r\nthe Palatiness of Podolia, Rzewuska. This visit possessed a doubled\r\ninterest for me; I was anxious to see Rzewuski, the vice-grand-general\r\nof the crown, because I had heard my father speak of him so often.\r\n\r\nThe vice-grand-general, although belonging to an illustrious family, was\r\nbrought up among the children of the common people; he went barefooted\r\nas they did, and shared all their pleasures (very rustic indeed, it\r\nseems to me). This strange education has given him great strength and a\r\nwonderful constitution. He is now quite aged; he is more than fifty\r\nyears old, and yet he walks and rides like a young man. Following the\r\nold Polish custom, he permits his beard to grow, and this gives him a\r\nvery grave appearance.\r\n\r\nThey say he has composed some very fine tragedies. We also called upon\r\nMadame Brühl, who received us most politely. Her husband, the king's\r\nfavorite minister, is not much esteemed, but they are visited for the\r\nsake of etiquette, and likewise for that of Madame Brühl, who is very\r\namiable.\r\n\r\nWe saw too Madame Soltyk, Castellane of Sandomir; she is a widow, but\r\nstill young and beautiful. Her son is nine years old; he is a charming\r\nchild, already possessing all the manners of the best society. As we\r\nentered, he offered me a chair, and made me, at the same time, a very\r\ngraceful compliment; the castellane was kind enough to say that he was a\r\ngreat admirer of pretty faces and black eyes. The Bishop of Cracow is\r\nthis child's uncle; he was anxious to have the charge of him, but his\r\nmother was not willing to part with him.\r\n\r\nOf all the persons whom I saw, I was the most pleased with Madame\r\nMoszynska, the widow of the grand-treasurer of the crown. She received\r\nme most affectionately, and I feel a strong attraction toward her. She\r\nexpressed much admiration for me; but indeed, I received commendation\r\neverywhere, and everywhere did I hear that I was beautiful. Perhaps I\r\nowe a great part of these praises to my costume; I was so well\r\ndressed! ... much better than at Barbara's wedding! I wore a white silk\r\ndress with gauze flounces, and my hair was dressed with pearls.\r\n\r\nIf I had seen the Duke of Courland, I should have been perfectly\r\nsatisfied; but I met him in none of the houses to which I went. They say\r\nhe is so happy to be once more with his family that he devotes all his\r\ntime to them. This feeling seems very natural to me, for when I was at\r\nboarding school, I was very melancholy whenever I thought of my parents,\r\nand I felt an imperative desire to see them, surpassing anything I had\r\nbefore experienced.\r\n\r\nThe carnival will soon begin; every one says it will be very brilliant,\r\nand that there will be many balls; it is impossible that I should not\r\nsomewhere meet the Duke of Courland.\r\n\r\n\r\nWednesday, _January 1st, 1750_.\r\n\r\nAll my desires have been gratified, and far beyond my hopes; I have seen\r\nthe prince royal! I have seen and spoken to him! ... I must indeed be\r\ndreaming; my mind is filled with the most lively impressions, strange\r\nand wild fancies surge through my brain, and I feel at once exalted and\r\ndepressed, transported with joy and tremulous through fear. I would not\r\ndare to confide to any one that which I am about to write; it is all\r\nperhaps only illusion, deception, error.... But yet, I have always\r\nhitherto judged correctly of the effect which I produced; I\r\ninstinctively divined the degree in which I pleased; I have never been\r\ndeceived; can I be mistaken now? ... And indeed, why should not a prince\r\nfind me beautiful, when all other men tell me that I am so? But there\r\nwas more than admiration in the prince royal's eyes, which have a\r\npeculiarly penetrating expression; his look was more kind than ordinary\r\nglances, and said more than any words. Perhaps all princes may be thus!\r\n\r\nBut that I may remember during my whole life, or rather that I may one\r\nday read all this again, I will now write down a detailed account of\r\nlast evening and of the few hours immediately preceding.\r\n\r\nYesterday morning the Princess Lubomirska sent for me and said, 'To-day\r\nis the last of the year, and there will be to-night a grand festival, a\r\nmasked ball; all the nobility will be there, and even the king and his\r\nsons; at least, I think so. I have selected a dress for you; you will go\r\nas a virgin of the sun.'\r\n\r\nI was so charmed with the choice of this costume, that I kissed the hand\r\nof the princess.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner all the maids came to assist at my toilet, and most\r\nassuredly it was no ordinary toilet. My hair was not powdered and I wore\r\nno hoop, whence the prince said to me, quite gravely, 'This costume is\r\nnot at all in accordance with received notions and fashions; any other\r\nwoman would certainly be lost were she to wear it; but I am sure you\r\nwill supply by the severity of your deportment and the propriety of your\r\nmanners whatever may be lacking in dignity, or too light, in your\r\ndress.'\r\n\r\nI did not forget his advice: notwithstanding my vivacity, I can assume\r\nupon occasion a very majestic air; and indeed, I overheard some one\r\nsaying at the ball, 'Who is that queen in disguise?'\r\n\r\nAh! I know that I was more beautiful than I usually am. My hair, without\r\npowder and black as ebony, fell in curls over my forehead, my neck, and\r\nmy shoulders; my dress was made of white gauze, and had not that long\r\ntrain which hides the feet and impedes the motions. I wore a zone of\r\ngold and precious stones round my waist, and was entirely enveloped in a\r\ntransparent white veil; I seemed to be in a cloud. When I looked in my\r\nmirror, I could scarcely recognize myself.\r\n\r\nThe ball room, brilliantly lighted, and glittering with gold and the\r\nmost gorgeous costumes, presented a dazzling spectacle; the women,\r\nnearly all robed in fancy dresses, were charming; I did not know to\r\nwhich one I should give the preference.\r\n\r\nA few moments after our arrival, we learned that the Duke of Courland\r\nwas in the hall; my eyes sought and found him, surrounded by a brilliant\r\ngroup of young men. His dress differed but little from that of the lords\r\nof his court; but I could distinguish him among them all. His figure is\r\ntall and dignified, his air noble and affable; his beautiful blue eyes\r\nand his charming smile eclipse all that approach him; where he is, no\r\none can see anything but himself.\r\n\r\nI looked at him until our eyes met; then I avoided his gaze, but found\r\nit always fixed upon me. But what was my confusion when I understood\r\nthat he was asking the Prince Palatine Lubomirski who I was! His face\r\nlighted up with joy when he heard the answer; be made no delay in\r\napproaching the Princess Lubomirska, and saluted her with a grace\r\npeculiar to himself. After the exchange of the preliminary compliments,\r\nthe princess introduced me as her niece. I do not know what kind of a\r\ncourtesy I made, doubtless quite different from that which I had learned\r\nfrom my dancing master; I was so agitated, and still am so much so,\r\nthat I cannot remember the words used by the prince as he saluted me;\r\nbut the impression is not fugitive like the words.\r\n\r\nWhat an evening! The prince opened the ball with the princess\r\npalatiness, and danced the second polonaise--with me; he had then time\r\nto speak to me; and I, at first so timid, embarrassed, and agitated,\r\nfound myself replying to him with inconceivable assurance. He questioned\r\nme about my parents, my sister the starostine, and all the details of\r\nher marriage. I was surprised to find him so well acquainted with my\r\nfamily affairs; but then I remembered that Kochanowski, son of the\r\ncastellan, is his favorite. What a good, forgiving soul that Kochanowski\r\nmust have; not only has he digested the goose dressed with the black\r\nsauce, but he has said so many kind things of us all!\r\n\r\nThe prince danced with me nearly the whole evening, and talked all the\r\ntime ... The words would seem insignificant and absurd, were I to write\r\nthem down; but with him, tone, manner, expression, all speak and say\r\nmore than words, and yet his very words signify more, depict better, and\r\npenetrate more deeply than those of others. I keep them in my memory,\r\nand fear to weaken their impression should I write them.\r\n\r\nWhen, at midnight, the cannon were fired to announce the end of one year\r\nand the beginning of another, the prince said to me, 'Ah! never can I\r\nforget the hours I have just passed; this is not a new year which I am\r\nbeginning, but a new life which I am receiving.'\r\n\r\nThis is but one of the many things he said to me; but as he always spoke\r\nFrench, I should find great difficulty, in my present agitated state of\r\nmind, in translating his conversation into Polish.\r\n\r\nAll that I have read in Mademoiselle Scudery, or in Madame de Lafayette,\r\nis flat, compared with what the prince himself said to me; but perhaps\r\nthis may all be nothing more than simple politeness. Ah! merciful\r\nHeaven, if it should be indeed an illusion, a mere court flattery,\r\napplicable to all women, or, perhaps,--a series of empty compliments,\r\ndue solely to my dress, which became me wonderfully well! I am a prey to\r\nthe most inconceivable perplexities, and dare confide in no one; I\r\nshould not venture to say to any one: 'Has he a real preference for me?'\r\n\r\nMy parents are far away, and the princess does not invite my confidence;\r\nI fear her as a cold, severe, and uninterested judge.... The prince\r\npalatine is very kind, but can one expose to a man all the weakness of a\r\nwoman's heart? ... I am then abandoned to myself, without a standard of\r\njudgment, without experience or advice.... Yesterday, I was at school,\r\nstudying as a child, and now I am thrown into a world entirely new, and\r\nin which I am playing a part envied by all my sex.... I surely dream, or\r\nI have lost my reason.\r\n\r\nIn ten days Barbara will be here, and she must be my good angel; she\r\nwill guide and protect me: she is so wise, and has so much judgment! I\r\nwill be so glad to lay my soul bare before her; I have no fear of her,\r\nshe is so compassionate; she is beautiful and happy, and I have always\r\nremarked that such women are the best.\r\n\r\nI have not seen my dear sister for nine months; but I see from her\r\nletters that she is every day more and more loved by her husband, and\r\nsatisfied with her destiny.\r\n\r\nShall I again see the prince royal? Will he recognize me in my ordinary\r\ndress, and will he still think me beautiful?...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAIDEN'S DREAMING.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Fast the sunset light is fading,\r\n    Nearer comes the lonely night,\r\n  On a maid intently dreaming\r\n    Dimly falls the evening light.\r\n\r\n  Far into the future gazing,\r\n    Heeds she not the waning light;\r\n  By the fireside softly dreaming,\r\n    Heeds she not the minutes' flight.\r\n\r\n  Heeds she not the firelight flickering\r\n    Bright upon her dark brown hair,\r\n  Tresses where the gold still lingers--\r\n    Loth to quit a home so fair.\r\n\r\n  On her lap a book is lying,\r\n    Clasped her hands upon her knee;\r\n  Dreaming of the distant future--\r\n    Wonders what her fate will be.\r\n\r\n  Dreams of knights of manly bearing,\r\n    Nodding plumes and shining casques,\r\n  Wearing all her favorite colors,\r\n    Quick to do whate'er she asks.\r\n\r\n  Dreams of castles old and stately,\r\n    Vaulted halls all life and light,\r\n  Courtly nobles stepping through them,\r\n    Smiling dames with jewels bright.\r\n\r\n  Round her own brow, in her dreaming,\r\n    She a coronet has bound;\r\n  Round her waist, so lithe and slender,\r\n    Venus' girdle she has wound.\r\n\r\n  Charms the knights of manly bearing,\r\n    Courtly nobles seek her grace,\r\n  Maidens free from envious passions\r\n    Love her kind and smiling face.\r\n\r\n  Now her dreams are growing fainter,\r\n    And her eyelids heavy grow;\r\n  Dull the waning firelight flickers\r\n    On her brow as white as snow.\r\n\r\n  Lower droop the heavy eyelids--\r\n    Weary eyes they cover quite--\r\n  And the dreamy girl is sleeping\r\n    Softly in the red firelight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRTY DAYS WITH THE SEVENTY-FIRST REGIMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 71st Regiment N.Y.S.N.G. left New York to aid in repelling the\r\ninvasion of Pennsylvania on the 17th of June. On the 19th, having\r\nmeantime determined to 'go to the wars,' Dick and I presented ourselves\r\nat the armory, inquiring whether we could follow and join the regiment,\r\nand were told briefly to report there at one o'clock on Monday next, and\r\ngo on with a squad.\r\n\r\nSo at one o'clock on Monday we stood ready in the armory, duly clothed\r\nin blue and buttons; but long after the appointed hour we waited without\r\nmoving, I taking the chance to practise in putting on my knapsack and\r\naccoutrements, whose various straps and buckles seemed at first as\r\nintricate as a ship's rigging, and benefiting by the kindly hints of\r\nregular members who sent substitutes this trip.\r\n\r\nAt length came the word, 'Fall in,' and the squad formed, about a\r\nhundred. A few minutes' drill ensued, sufficing to show me that I needed\r\nconsiderably more, and then out--down Broadway to Cortlandt\r\nstreet--aboard the ferry boat--into the cars, and about half past seven\r\nactually off, amid the cheers and wavings of the bystanders, men, women,\r\nand children.\r\n\r\n'Gone for a soger!' Should I ever come back? Perhaps I should wish\r\nmyself home again soon enough. However, that couldn't be now, so good-by\r\neverything and everybody, and into it head and heels.\r\n\r\nI went, among other reasons, chiefly to see _what it was like_, and I\r\nwill record my experience;--for though, since the war began, tales and\r\nsketches of military life have been written and read without number, and\r\nwe have all become sufficiently learned in warlike matters to see how\r\nignorant of, and unprepared for war the nation was at the outbreak of\r\nthe rebellion; yet, all I saw and learned was new to me, and may prove\r\ninteresting to some others.\r\n\r\nTuesday morning by daylight we were in Harrisburg, and marched from the\r\ncars to the Capitol grounds through the just awaking town, escorted by\r\none policeman armed with a musket. There a wash at a hydrant refreshed\r\nme--then to breakfast in a temporary shed-like erection near the depot.\r\n\r\nAn army breakfast! Huge lumps of bread and salt junk, and coffee. To\r\nthis I knew it must come; but just then, after spending the night in the\r\ncars, the most I could do was to swallow some coffee, scorning however\r\nto join those who dispersed through the town for a civilized\r\nbreakfast--wherein I intended to be soldierly, though before long I\r\nlearned that your old soldier is the very man who goes upon the plan of\r\nsnatching comfort whenever he can.\r\n\r\nBut the regiment was at Chambersburg; so for Chambersburg we took the\r\ncars, a distance, I believe, of about fifty miles.\r\n\r\nChambersburg, however, we were not destined to reach. Along the route we\r\nmet all sorts of rumors: 71st cut up; six men in the 8th killed;\r\nfighting still going on a little in front, &c., &c.;--a prospect of\r\nimmediate work. So in ignorance and doubt we came to Carlisle. Here we\r\nwere greeted by part of the 71st, and the truth proved to be that the\r\n8th and 71st had retreated to this place the night before. 'Not, not the\r\nsix hundred,' however, for the left wing of our regiment had somehow\r\nbeen left behind, and nothing was certainly known of it. At all events,\r\nwe were to go no farther, and out of the cars we came. Old members\r\nexchanged greetings, and recruits made acquaintances.\r\n\r\nBut what were we going to do? I could not learn. We waited, having\r\nstacked arms, some sleeping beneath the trees in the College grounds,\r\nuntil the lieutenant-colonel appeared upon the scene. Then we marched,\r\nback and forth; toward the cars--'going back to Harrisburg;' past the\r\ncars--'no, not to Harrisburg'--through the main street, and turned away\r\nfrom the town, still unconscious of officers' intentions. We privates\r\nnever know anything of plans or objects. We never know where we are\r\ngoing till we get there, nor what we are to do till we do it, and then\r\nwe don't know what we are going to do next. I soon got used to this; and\r\nalthough conjectures and prophecies fly through the ranks, of all kinds,\r\nfrom shrewd to ridiculous, I very early learned it was sheer bother of\r\none's brains attempting to discover anything, and ceased to ask\r\nquestions or form theories--getting up when I heard 'Company I, fall\r\nin,' without seeking to know whether it was for march, drill, picket\r\nduty, or what not. Company officers seldom know more about the matter\r\nthan their men, and I speedily came to content myself with trying to\r\nextract from past work and present position some general notion of the\r\n'strategy' of our movements. Nor is this ignorance wholly unblissful, as\r\nleaving always room for hope that the march is to be short or the coming\r\nwork pleasant. Well, in the present case, just out of the town we halted\r\nin the Fair grounds; an ample field, a high tight face around it, a\r\nlarge shed in the centre. We all stacked arms--most went to sleep. I\r\nalways took sleep when I could, because, in a regiment constantly on the\r\nmove as ours was, if you don't want it now, you will before long.\r\n\r\nBy and by, in came the left wing, weary but safe, and were greeted with\r\nthree tremendous cheers. I hastened to find Company I. The first\r\nlieutenant had come on with us--the captain I had not yet seen. To him I\r\nwas now introduced.\r\n\r\nVery soon the Fair ground was a camp; we on one side--the 8th N.Y.,\r\nColonel Varian, opposite. Tents were up, fires blazing, and cooking and\r\neating going on. As I had not started with the regiment, I had no tent,\r\nand none could be had here, so my camping consisted of piling my traps\r\nin a heap. But I needed none, and indeed, throughout the whole time was\r\nunder one but twice. Tents are all very well, when you are quietly\r\nencamped for any length, of time; but when, as with us, you are on the\r\nmore continually, I consider them a humbug and nuisance. You must carry\r\nhalf a one all day, and at night join it with your comrade's half. The\r\ncommon shelter tent, which is the only one that can be so carried, is a\r\npoor protection against heavy rain, for the water can beat in at the\r\nsides and form pools beneath you; against midday sun you can guard with\r\na blanket and two muskets, and at any other time you need no shelter.\r\n\r\nThat night I went on guard. Two hours you watch, four for sleep, and\r\nthen two hours you watch again. All quiet, save that two or three\r\nprisoners are brought in from the front to be deposited in limbo, and\r\ngazed at in the morning by recruits who have never seen a live rebel.\r\n\r\nThe most surprising thing I learned in these first days, was that\r\neverything one has will certainly be stolen by his own regiment, even by\r\nhis own company, if he does not watch it carefully. This practice is\r\nstyled '_winning_.' It is simple, naked stealing, in no wise to be\r\nexcused or palliated, and utterly disgraceful. It imposes, moreover, the\r\ngrievous nuisance of remaining to guard your property when you would be\r\nloafing about, or of carrying everything--no light load--with you,\r\nwherever you go. Of course, all colonels should prevent this, and one of\r\nany force and energy could easily do so; but Colonel ---- is not of that\r\nkind. An excellent company officer, as I judge, he has not the activity\r\nand nerve required in the commander of a regiment, and many a wish did\r\nI hear expressed in those thirty days that his predecessor, Colonel\r\nMartin, were still in command. Confidence in his bravery before the\r\nenemy, was universal; but many things necessary to the decorum,\r\ndiscipline, health, &c., of the regiment devolve duties finally upon the\r\ncolonel, for whose discharge other qualities than bravery are needed.\r\n\r\nThe next afternoon, the 24th, our laziness is disturbed by orders to\r\ntake three days' rations; our knapsacks are to be sent to Harrisburg; we\r\nare to pack up everything, to be ready to move, Nobody knows, of course,\r\nwhat it means; but a decided conviction prevails that 'something heavy\r\nis up.' Presently a hollow square is 'up,' formed of the 8th and\r\nourselves, field officers in the centre. Colonel Varian advances.\r\nUnquestionably a speech. Perhaps a few Napoleonic words on the eve of\r\nbattle. No; Colonel Varian wishes to explain that it was nobody's fault\r\nthat our left wing was deserted at Chambersburg, in order to prevent ill\r\nfeeling between the regiments. He does so, and appeals to our\r\nlieutenant-colonel. Our lieutenant-colonel verifies and indorses.\r\nPerfectly satisfactory; in evidence of which the two commands exchange\r\ncheers.\r\n\r\nHenceforth we and the 8th are fast friends. We have other friends\r\nalso--Captain Miller's battery, of Pennsylvania, has been in front with\r\nus, and though out for 'the emergency,' declares it will stay as long as\r\nthe 71st. So we all fraternize, hailing any member as '8th,' '71st,' or\r\n'Battery,' and cheer when we pass each other. The 8th are good cheerers,\r\nand though we outnumbered them, I think they outdid us in three times\r\nthree and a 'tiger,' the inevitable refrain. The 'tiger' (sounding\r\ntig-a-h-h) is the test of a cheer. If the cheer be a spontaneous burst\r\nof hearty good feeling, the tiger concentrates its energy, and is full\r\nand prolonged--if it be only the cheer courteous or the cheer civil, the\r\ntiger will fall off and die prematurely.\r\n\r\nJust at dark we left camp, passed rapidly through the town, along the\r\nturnpike about two miles, and halted in a cornfield beside the road,\r\nwhere we formed line of battle. We received orders to 'load at will,'\r\nand fire low. The 8th were on the opposite side of the road, and their\r\nbattery somewhere near us. After some time, nobody appearing, permission\r\nwas given to thrust our muskets by the bayonets in the ground; and soon\r\nafter, one by one, the men dropped off asleep. The evening had been\r\nextremely sensational. The sudden departure, the rapid march, whither\r\nand for what we knew not, yet full of momentary expectation; the orders\r\nand preparations indicating the imminence of grim, perhaps ghastly work,\r\nin the night hours; the line of men, stretching beyond sight in the\r\ndarkness, far from home, and, it might be, near to death, sleeping yet\r\nwaiting:--the total was singularly impressive.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I too was soon asleep, and slept undisturbed till morning.\r\nThen, rebels or no rebels, we must have breakfast. There was none to be\r\nhad in the regiment; but the farmhouses supplied us, and an ancient dame\r\nintermitted packing her goods for flight, to cook the pork which made\r\npart of my three days' rations. Then I stretched myself beneath the\r\nshade of a roadside house within sound of orders, and having nothing\r\nelse on hand, went to sleep again.\r\n\r\nI was now broken in. Camp rations I could eat; camp coffee, though\r\nalways _sans_ milk and often _sans_ sugar, I deemed good; a wash was a\r\nluxury, not a necessity; and I could sleep anywhere.\r\n\r\nWhen I was aroused, I found a barricade thrown up across the road, and a\r\nforce of contrabands digging a trench across the field. A cavalry picket\r\nreported the enemy within half a mile, advancing. The citizens came out\r\nfrom Carlisle to aid us, and we went in line into the trenches. Two men\r\nwere detailed from each company to carry off the wounded; the red\r\nhospital flag fluttered upon a house behind us, and the colonel,\r\npassing in front, told us they were very near, and exhorted us not to\r\nlet them pass. But the day wore on to evening, and no rebels appeared,\r\nand at dark we moved again. Starting in a heavy rain, we marched nine\r\nmiles to the borders of a town known as New Kingston. Here we halted\r\nwhile quarters were hunted up. Every man, tired with the rapid walking\r\nthrough rain and mud, squatted at once in the road, no matter where, and\r\nthen along the whole column singing began. A soldier will sing under all\r\ncircumstances, comfortable or uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nAt length we moved into the town and took possession of a church,\r\ndistributing ourselves in aisles, pews, and pulpit. What little remained\r\nof the night, we were glad to have in quiet. It had been questionable\r\nwhether we could reach Kingston, for on the march it was rumored that we\r\nwere flanked; and a man, emerging from the shade as we passed, had asked\r\na question of the chaplain, and, receiving no answer, had retreated a\r\nfew yards, and fired his piece in the air, which looked very like a\r\nsignal. The next morning, the 26th, we went into camp in woods just in\r\nfront of the town, while the general and the surgeon established\r\nheadquarters in the town.\r\n\r\nHere we repeated substantially the programme of the day before, except\r\nthat continuous rain was substituted for the baking sun, and proved far\r\nmore endurable.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the 27th we marched some seven or eight miles, and\r\nencamped at night in Oyster Point, about two miles from Harrisburg.\r\n\r\nSunday! the 28th of June. My first Sunday with the regiment. No rumors\r\nof the enemy reach us, and to us privates the prospect is of a quiet\r\nday. The boys gather round the chaplain for divine service. And as for a\r\nfew minutes we renew our connection with civilization, and, amid stacked\r\narms, tents, camp fires, and the paraphernalia of war, sing psalms and\r\nhymns, and listen to the chaplain's prayer, I decide that this surpasses\r\nall luxury possible in camp. I shall never forget that 'church.'\r\n\r\nBut no Sunday in camp. Hardly were the services concluded, when we went\r\nforward a little to an orchard, and then line of battle again. This\r\nperformance of 'laying for a fight' which never came, had by this time\r\ngrown tame, in fact intolerably stupid, and I for one was growing tired\r\nof sitting in silence, when boom! crash! a cannon shot in front of us,\r\nthe smoke visible too, curling above the woods, and showing how near it\r\nhad been fired. A smothered 'Ah!' and 'Now you've got it, boys,' went\r\nthrough the ranks. It was no humbug this time. The rebels were shelling\r\nthe woods as they advanced.\r\n\r\nBut it appeared we were not to receive them at that spot, for suddenly\r\nwe were ordered off again, and marched across lots, to the destruction\r\nof many a bushel of wheat, clear into the intrenchments in front of\r\nHarrisburg. There for the remainder of the day we waited in line. Other\r\nregiments, we knew not what, were near us in different positions. The\r\nsignal flags were waving, and officers galloping by constantly, of whom\r\nthe quartermaster was hailed with shouts of 'Grub, grub.'\r\n\r\nThat night my company and two others went out on picket, taking position\r\nnear our camp of the day before. In the morning we advanced a little to\r\na lane--a cobbler's stall was converted into headquarters, and the half\r\nof the company not on duty went foraging for dinner. Pigs and chickens\r\nwere captured, and cooking began in the kitchen of a deserted house\r\nclose by. Apple butter, too, the prevalent institution in Pennsylvania,\r\nwas found in plenty. So the two halves of the company relieved each\r\nother in standing guard and picnicking. Meantime, however, the rebels,\r\nfrom the woods just in front, were paying their respects with two-inch\r\nshell, which shrieked and crashed through the branches, bursting over\r\nus, around us, and many of them altogether too near to be pleasant.\r\nMoreover, by one of those blunders which cannot always be avoided, some\r\nof our own men, mistaking us, opened fire on our rear; but to this a\r\nstop was speedily put by a flag of truce, improvised from a ramrod and a\r\nwhite handkerchief. We were allowed to fire only three or four volleys\r\nin return. This skirmishing tries courage, I believe, more than a\r\npitched battle. To lie on the ground for hours, two or three miles in\r\nfront of your main body, ten feet from the nearest man, and be fired at\r\nwithout firing yourself or making any noise, is a different thing from\r\nstanding in your place amid the throng and all the noise, excitement,\r\nand enthusiasm of a battle, earnestly occupied in firing as fast as you\r\ncan. In a battle all the circumstances combine to produce high\r\nexcitement and drive fear out of a man, leaving room only for that kind\r\nof courage properly called fearlessness or _intrepidity_, belonging to\r\nmen like Governor Pickens, 'born insensible to fear.' But the highest\r\ngrade of courage is that which, despite of fear, stands firm. That is\r\nthe courage of principle, of _morale_, as opposed to purely physical\r\ncourage. It is the last degree--at the next step we rise into heroism.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon we were relieved by a Pennsylvania company, and as we\r\nretired in full sight of the rebels, the rascals yelled at us, and gave\r\nus several volleys, from which it is wonderful that every man escaped.\r\n\r\nThat evening we moved to the extreme rear, into Fort Washington, on the\r\nbank of the river in front of Harrisburg. Here it was said our advance\r\nwork was over, and we were promised comfortable quarters and rest.\r\n\r\nAny one nowadays can see a camp, but only one who has seen it can\r\nunderstand how picturesque it is. The night scene at Harrisburg was\r\nbeautiful in the extreme. Behind us slept the city--we guarded it in\r\nfront, and the river rolled between. The moonlight, illuminating a most\r\nexquisite scenery, between the foliage gave glimpses of that placid\r\nstream, and shone upon the tents and bayonets of some six thousand men\r\nwithin the formidable works; the expiring fires sent up wreaths of\r\nsmoke; grim guns looked over the ramparts down the gentle slope in front\r\nand up the beautiful Cumberland Valley; and only the occasional call of\r\nthe sentry for the corporal of the guard broke the serene stillness.\r\n\r\nHere were our friends of the 8th, and here we regained our knapsacks.\r\nMany of them had been 'gone through,' and everything 'won.' The 56th and\r\n22d New York, the 23d and 18th Brooklyn, besides others, were encamped\r\ninside.\r\n\r\nHere we were sworn into the United States service for thirty days from\r\nthe 17th June.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, July 1st, all our prospect of camp life, with its\r\nregularity of drill, inspection, and, above all, of rations, was dashed\r\nby orders to move in the morning to Carlisle. General Knipe, riding\r\nthrough camp, was asked where he was going to take us. 'Right into the\r\nface of the enemy,' said he. 'Hi, hi!' shouted the men.\r\n\r\nSo away we went again. I was detailed to guard baggage, and remained,\r\nloading wagons, &c., subject to the quartermaster, and went on in the\r\ncars to Carlisle, where, on the evening of the 3d, I joined the regiment\r\nwhen it came in.\r\n\r\nSince we left Carlisle the rebels had been there and burned the\r\nbarracks. They had shelled the town the night before, and the 37th had\r\nhad a sharp skirmish with them.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 4th July we started about ten thousand strong--a\r\nmovement in force. The battle of Gettysburg had been fought, the danger\r\nto Harrisburg was past, and, without knowing exactly where we were\r\nbound, it was plain that we were to cooperate with Meade. That day we\r\nmade a long march. Our knapsacks were left behind. The first six miles\r\nwere well enough. We move on slowly, the sun overclouded, the road good,\r\nand marching, as always is allowed on a long march (save when we pass\r\nthrough a town), without order or file. The men talk, laugh, and sing,\r\nget water and tobacco from the roadside dwellers, and chaff them with\r\nall sorts of absurd questions. The first six miles are pleasant. At the\r\nfoot of the South Mountains we rest. This is Papertown. Papertown, as\r\nfar as visible, consists of one house. From the piazza of said house, an\r\n8th makes a speech: I am not near enough to hear, but suppose it funny,\r\nfor colonels and all laugh. Some go to eating, some to sleep, some take\r\nthe chance, as is wise, to wash their feet at the stream below, the best\r\npreventive of blisters.\r\n\r\nIn an hour it begins to rain, and we start to go through the Gap, along\r\nwhich we meet squads of prisoners and deserters from Lee's army. Eleven\r\nmiles through that rain. I have never seen such rain before; it is\r\ncredited to the cannonading which for days past has been going on all\r\naround. Trudge, trudge; in fifteen minutes soaked through, in half an\r\nhour walking in six inches of water, in two hours walking in six inches\r\nof mud. Then throw away blankets and overcoats--men fall behind done\r\nup--men can go no farther for sore feet.\r\n\r\nAt Pine Grove, that night, Company I, out of seventy men, musters thirty\r\nat roll call. The different regiments scatter over half a mile of\r\nground. Every fence about is converted into fuel. The cattle and hogs in\r\nthe fields are levied upon--shot, dressed, cooked, and eaten. There is\r\nnothing else to be had, and the wagons cannot follow us for some time\r\nover such roads. So officers shut their eyes. It rains still, but we can\r\nbe no wetter than we are, so we lie down and take it. This is our\r\nglorious Fourth!\r\n\r\nIn the morning--Sunday morning again--there is nothing to eat. In the\r\ntown, which comprises half a dozen houses and an old foundery, the\r\nanswer is, 'The rebels has eat us all out.' A few secure loaves of\r\nbread, paying as high as a dollar; another few boil what coffee they had\r\ncarried with them and contrived to save from the rain. The rest have\r\nnothing. Henceforth the order of the day is march and starve, and the\r\nstory is only of ceaseless fatigue, hunger, and rain. Thus far we have\r\nstood stiff and taken it cheerfully. There was growling before we got\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nOff again over the mountains.\r\n\r\nIf I have enough to eat, I can stand anything--if not, I break down. In\r\ntwo miles I 'caved in.' The captain thought the regiment would return\r\nshortly. So I staid behind. On Monday afternoon, however, they had not\r\ncome back, and I started after them. I got a meal and passed the night\r\nin a house on the mountain, and, after some sixteen miles' walking,\r\ncaught them on the broad turnpike the next day, and marched some seven\r\nmiles farther, to Funkstown, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nHere an episode. As we started the next morning (in the rain, of\r\ncourse), I was sent to the rear to report to a sergeant. The sergeant,\r\nwith nine besides me, reported to the brigade quartermaster. The\r\nquartermaster distributed the ten, with an equal number of the 23d,\r\nthrough ten army wagons, to drive and guard. We went through\r\nChambersburg to Shippensburg, where we loaded with provisions. Here I\r\nheard abundance of the doings of the rebels, who loaded seven hundred\r\nwagons at this place. I bought Confederate money and got meals at a\r\nhotel--at my own expense.\r\n\r\nOn Friday evening, the 10th, we rejoined the column at Waynesboro', a\r\nwelcome arrival, for grub was terribly scarce. Here was the Sixth Corps,\r\nArmy of the Potomac, under General Neal--'Bucky Neal,' a 'Potomaker'\r\ncalled him. For a time we belonged to it, and adorned our caps with the\r\nbadge of the corps, cut out of cracker.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday evening we crossed the line into Maryland, fording the\r\nAntietam creek, the bridge over which the rebs had burned; and Sunday we\r\nfooted it back and forth over roads and across lots, bringing up at\r\nCavetown.\r\n\r\n'Earthquakes, as usual,' wrote Lady Sale, in her 'Diary.' 'Rain, as\r\nusual,' wrote we. And such rain! They do a heavy business in rain in\r\nthat region, and in thunder and lightning, too. I have heard Western\r\nthunder storms described, but I doubt if they surpass such as are common\r\nbeneath these mountains. Four poor fellows of the 56th, who were sitting\r\nbeneath a tree, were struck by lightning--one of them killed.\r\n\r\nOn Monday we camped at Boonsboro', and on Tuesday beside a part of\r\nMeade's army. When I saw all the wagons here, and what an immense job it\r\nis to move any considerable force, with all the delays that may come\r\nfrom broken wheels, lame horses, and bad roads, I could not but smile at\r\nthe military critics at home, who show you how general this should have\r\nmade a rapid movement so; or general that hurled a force upon that\r\npoint, &c.\r\n\r\nHere, near Boonsboro', on Tuesday night, the 14th, news of the riot in\r\nNew York reached us. The near approach of the expiration of our time had\r\nalready made much talk of home, and now anxiety was doubled. Rumors flew\r\nthrough camp, and all ears and mouths were open, and before we settled\r\nfor the night it came. Orderlies carried directions through the ranks to\r\nhave all ready and clean up pieces to go home.\r\n\r\nIn the morning our Battery friends came up to say good-by. Seventy-first\r\nbuttons were exchanged for their crossed-cannon badges, songs sung and\r\ncheers given _ad lib_.\r\n\r\nSoon we all started, bound, we knew, for the cars at Frederick City. The\r\nlast march! It was very warm, and the road across the mountains often\r\nsteep, but there was little straggling.\r\n\r\nMost incidents of soldier life grow tame, but to the last the spectacle\r\nof the column on march retained its impressiveness for me.\r\n\r\nWe passed through Frederick just at dusk--ejaculating tenderly 'Ah! ah!'\r\nas fair damsels waved handkerchiefs at us--and went out to the junction.\r\nThe cars were ready. We had done the last march. Twenty-five miles that\r\nday! And I had gone through this month of walking without foot trouble,\r\nfor which I am indebted to my 'pontoons,' i.e., Government shoes. Take\r\nthem large enough, and they are the only things to walk in.\r\n\r\nMarching is the hardest thing I met with. I have always been a regular\r\nand good walker. But ordinary walking is no preparation for marching.\r\nThe weight of musket and accoutrements, the dust (rain and mud in our\r\ncase), the inability to see before you, and the necessity of keeping up\r\nin place, are all wearing and nervously exhausting.\r\n\r\nWe did not get off at once. Red tape delayed us, and we growled\r\nsavagely. But we had plenty to eat, and a river beside us. So, bathing\r\nand eating, we passed Thursday in sight of the train. At length red tape\r\nwas untied, and Thursday night the 8th and 71st set off, in cattle cars.\r\nThis time the advance was a privilege. In Baltimore we were beset by\r\nwomen trying to sell cakes, and boys trying to beg cartridges. Along the\r\nroad we ate, smoked, and slept. In Philadelphia we had 'supper' in the\r\n'United States Volunteers' Refreshment Saloon.' I remember a bright girl\r\nthere, who got me a second cup of coffee.\r\n\r\nAnd so, Saturday morning, the 18th, we took the boat at Amboy, within\r\ntwo hours of home! But there was less hilarity than usual on the return\r\nof a regiment. Our news from the city was not the latest, and our\r\ngrimmest work might be to come--and in New York! Woe to any show of a\r\nmob we had met! The indignation was deep and intense.\r\n\r\nBut in two minutes after we landed on the Battery, papers were\r\ncirculated through the ranks, and we knew all was quiet.\r\n\r\nSo up Broadway. We were too early in the street to gather much of a\r\ncrowd. Those who were out hailed us heartily, and at the corner of Grand\r\nstreet or thereabouts an ardent individual from a fourth-story window,\r\nplying two boards cymbal-wise (_clap_-boards, say), initiated a\r\nrespectable noise. And so round the corner and into the armory at Centre\r\nMarket. The campaign was over, and a few days after we were paid off and\r\nmustered out.\r\n\r\nAs I said, I went to see what it was like, and I saw. It is a strange\r\nlife, but a wholesome one, if you get a tolerable sufficiency to eat,\r\nand not too heavy a dose of marching. So severe a time as we had is\r\nterribly _physical_, and benumbs the brain somewhat. The campaign was\r\nshort, but the utmost was crowded into those thirty days.\r\n\r\nThe first portion was advance work, always arduous. General Knipe's work\r\nwas to check the rebel advance. He did so by going to the front and\r\nmeeting them, and then retreating slowly before them, making a stand and\r\ndemonstration of fight, at which their advance would fall back on the\r\nmain body, at whose approach he would up stakes, run a few miles, and\r\nmake another show. Thus he gained ten days' time, which enabled General\r\nCouch, in command of the department, to fortify, and collect and\r\norganize troops, and probably saved Harrisburg. And for the manner in\r\nwhich he did it, without, too, the loss of a man, he deserves credit.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, did I like it? Well, I am glad I have been. But the exact\r\nanswer to that question is a sentence of Winthrop's, in his paper\r\n'Washington as a Camp': 'It is monotonous, it is not monotonous, it is\r\nlaborious, it is lazy, it is a bore, it is a lark, it is half war, half\r\npeace, and totally attractive, and not to be dispensed with from one's\r\nexperience in the nineteenth century.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASON, RHYME, AND RHYTHM.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.--TRUTH AND LOVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Divine Attributes, the base of all true Art.\r\n\r\nArt must be based upon a study of Nature, upon a clear and comprehensive\r\nknowledge of natural laws. No man was ever yet a _great_ poet without\r\nbeing at the same time a profound philosopher, for Poetry is the blossom\r\nand fragrance of all human knowledge, human thoughts, human passions,\r\nand human emotions. The poet must have the ability to observe things as\r\nthey really are, in order to depict them with accuracy, unchanged by any\r\npassion in the mind of the describer, whether the things to be depicted\r\nare actually present to the senses, or have a place only in the memory.\r\n\r\nNature may be regarded either as the home of man, and consequently\r\nassociated with all the phases of his existence; or as an assemblage of\r\nsymbols, manifesting the thoughts of the Creator. In accordance with the\r\nfirst view, the poet may give it its place in the different scenes of\r\nhuman life, animated with our passions, sympathizing with us, and\r\nexpressing our feelings; in the second, he must try to interpret this\r\ndivine language, to seize the idea gleaming through the veil of the\r\nmaterial envelope, for there is an established harmony between material\r\nnature and intellectual. Every thought has its reflection in a visible\r\nobject which repeats it like an echo, reflects it like a mirror,\r\nrendering it sensible first to the senses by the visible image, then to\r\nthe thought by the thought.\r\n\r\nGenius is the instinct of discovering some more of the words in this\r\ndivine language of universal analogies, the key of which God alone\r\npossesses, but some portions of whose stores he sometimes deigns to\r\nunclose for man. Therefore in earlier times the Prophet, an inspired\r\npoet; and the poet, an uninspired prophet--were both considered holy.\r\nThey are now looked upon as insane or useless; and indeed, this is but a\r\nlogical consequence of the so-called _utilitarian_ views. If only the\r\nmaterial and palpable part of nature which may be calculated, percented,\r\nturned into gold, or made to minister to sensual pleasures, is to be\r\nregarded with interest; if the lessons of the harvest, with its 'good\r\nseed and tares,' and the angels, its reapers; the teachings of the\r\nsparrow and the Divine Love which watched over them; the grass and the\r\nlilies of the field clothed in splendor by their Creator, are to awaken\r\nneither hope nor fear--then men are right in despising those who\r\npreserve a deep reverence for moral beauty; the idea of God in his\r\ncreation; and respect the language of images, the mysterious relations\r\nbetween the visible and invisible worlds. Is it asked what does this\r\nlanguage prove? The answer is, God and Immortality! Alas! they are worth\r\nnothing on 'Change!\r\n\r\nYet let him who would study his own happiness and well-being, follow the\r\nadvice given in the Good Book:\r\n\r\n     'Look upon the rainbow, and bless Him that made it, _for it is very\r\n     beautiful_.\r\n\r\n     'It encompasseth the heavens about with the circle of its glory;\r\n     the hands of the Most High have displayed it.'\r\n\r\nAs creation is symbolic, and the province of the poet is humbly to\r\nimitate the works of the Great Artist, we must expect to find him also\r\nmake use of symbolic language, imagery.\r\n\r\nMetaphor (metapherô) is the application of a physical fact to the moral\r\norder; the association of an external material fact to one internal and\r\nintellectual. As this association is not reflective, but spontaneous,\r\nand is found pervading the infancy of languages; as it is intuitively\r\nand generally understood; it must take place in accordance with a mental\r\nlaw which establishes natural relations of analogy between the moral\r\nworld and the physical. To become perceptible, thought must be imaged,\r\nreflected upon a sensuous form; the definition by an image is generally\r\nthe most clear and complete. We may have clear enough ideas of some\r\ninvisible truth in our own minds, but if we would convey our conception\r\nto another, we cannot give it to him by a pure idea, for then we would\r\nstill be in the internal world of intellect; we must go out from this\r\ninternal world, we must seek a sign in the physical world that he can\r\nsee and contemplate; we select some phenomenon which can be easily\r\nobserved, and in accordance with the law of analogy of which we have\r\njust spoken, we associate our thought with it, and in this manner we can\r\nclearly communicate the thought we have conceived.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the ideas we have of the moral world are expressed through\r\nmetaphors: thus we say the _movements_ or _emotions_ of the soul; the\r\n_clearness_ or _coloring_ of a style; the _heat_ or _warmth_ of a\r\ndiscourse; the _hardness_ or _softness_ of the heart, &c., &c. Language\r\n_expresses_ the invisible thought of the soul; in accordance with the\r\netymology of the word (exprimere) it _presses_ them from the soul, from\r\nthe realm of internal thought, to transport them to the visible sphere.\r\nBut the etymology itself is nothing but a metaphor, for the immaterial\r\nfacts of the soul always remain in their own region inaccessible to the\r\nsenses, and the instinctive facts of the organism always remain in the\r\nvisible world, so that there can be no actual passage from one to the\r\nother, for an immaterial fact cannot be changed into a material\r\none:--association, simultaneousness, correlation may obtain between\r\nthem, but nothing more.\r\n\r\nSaint Thomas Aquinas asserts 'that in our present state of degradation\r\nthe intellect comprehends nothing without an image.' Language is in\r\nreality the association of material facts to facts of the will, heart,\r\nand intellect. Apparently insufficient to give a full idea of material\r\nthings alone, it would seem almost impossible that it should ever be\r\nable to express the facts of the invisible world; but the human spirit,\r\nin accordance with the mental law impressed upon it by the Hand Divine,\r\nseizes the analogies of the _moral_ phenomena with the phenomena of\r\n_nature_, and, seeing physical facts used as symbols by the Creator to\r\nconvey ethical, also instinctively uses them to express the facts of the\r\nmoral world; and thus is born the _human Word_ which, invisibly\r\nploughing the waves of the unseen air, can convey the most subtile\r\nthought, the most evanescent shade of feeling, the wildest, darkest, and\r\ndeepest emotion. Language is man's expression of the finite, with its\r\ninfinite meanings modified by the extent of his intelligence and his\r\npower of expression. It is truly a universal possession, but every man\r\ngifts it with his own individualities, his own idiosyncrasies. The\r\nstyle, one might almost say, is the man.\r\n\r\nThus the imagery of language finds its base in the very essence of our\r\nbeing. The poet is one gifted to seize upon these hidden analogies, to\r\nread these mystic symbols, and, through the force of his own\r\nimagination, to reveal them to his brethren in truth and love.\r\n\r\nThe imagination has two distinct functions. It combines, and by\r\ncombination creates new forms; it penetrates, analyzes, and realizes\r\ntruths _discoverable by no other faculty_.\r\n\r\nAn imagination of high power of combination seizes and associates at the\r\n_same moment all_ the important ideas of its work or poem, so that while\r\nit is working with any one of them, it is at the same instant working\r\nwith and modifying them all in their several relations to it. It never\r\nonce loses sight of their bearings upon each other--as the volition\r\nmoves through every part of the body of a snake at the same moment,\r\nuncoiling some of its involute rings at the very instant it is coiling\r\nothers. This faculty is inconceivable, admirable, almost divine; yet no\r\nless an operation is necessary for the production of any great work, for\r\nby the definition of unity of membership above given, not only certain\r\ncouples or groups of parts, but _all_ the parts of a noble work must be\r\nseparately imperfect; each must imply and ask for all the rest; the\r\nglory of every one of them must consist in its relation to the rest;\r\nneither while so much as _one_ is wanting can _any_ be right. This\r\nfaculty is indeed something that looks as if its possessor were made in\r\nthe Divine image!\r\n\r\n  'The hand that rounded Peter's dome,\r\n  And groined the aisles of Christian Rome,\r\n  Wrought in a sad sincerity;\r\n  Himself from God he could not free;\r\n  He builded better than he knew;--\r\n  The conscious stone to beauty grew.'\r\n\r\nEMERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the power of the combining imagination various ideas are chosen from\r\nan infinite mass, ideas which are separately imperfect, but which shall\r\ntogether be perfect, and of whose unity therefore the idea must be\r\nformed at the very moment they are seized, as it is only in that unity\r\nthat their appropriateness consists, and therefore only the conception\r\nof that unity can prompt the preference. Therefore he alone can conceive\r\nand compose who sees the _whole_ at once before him.\r\n\r\nShakspeare is the great example of this marvellous power. Not only is\r\nevery word which falls from the lips of his various characters true to\r\nhis first conception of them, so true that we always know how they will\r\nact under any given circumstances, and we could substitute no other\r\nwords than the words used by them without contradicting our first\r\nimpression of them; but every character with which they come in contact\r\nis not only ever true to itself, but is precisely of the nature best\r\nfitted to develop the traits, vices, or virtues of the main figure. So\r\nperfect and complete is this lifelike unity, that we can scarcely think\r\nof one of his leading characters without recalling all those with whom\r\nit is associated. If we name Juliet, for instance, not only is her idea\r\ninseparable from that of Romeo, but the whole train of Montagues and\r\nCapulets, Mercutio, Tybalt, the garrulous nurse, the lean apothecary,\r\nthe lonely friar, sweep by. What an exquisite trait of the poetic\r\ntemperament, tenderness, and human sympathies of this same lonely friar\r\nis given us in his exclamation:\r\n\r\n  'Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot\r\n  Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint.'\r\n\r\nIt also explains to us that it was the good friar's unconscious\r\naffection for Juliet, the pure sympathies of a lonely but loving heart,\r\nwhich so imprudently induced him to unite the unfortunate young lovers.\r\nThe men and women of Shakspeare live and love, and we cannot think of\r\nthem without at the same time thinking of those with whom they lived and\r\nwhom they loved. Indeed, when we can wrest any character in a drama from\r\nthose which surround it, and study it apart, the unity of the _whole_ is\r\nbut apparent, never vital. Simplicity, harmony, life, power, truth, and\r\nlove, are all to be found in any high work of the _associative_\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\nWe now proceed to characterize the _penetrative_ imagination, 'which\r\nanalyzes and realizes truths discoverable by no other faculty.' Of this\r\nfaculty Shakspeare is also master. Ruskin, from whom we continue to\r\nquote, says: It never stops at crusts or ashes, or outward images of any\r\nkind, but ploughing them all aside, plunges at once into the very\r\ncentral fiery heart; its function and gift are the getting at the root;\r\nits nature and dignity depend on its holding things always _by the\r\nheart_. Take its hand from off the beating of that, and it will prophesy\r\nno longer; it looks not into the eyes, it judges not by the voice, it\r\ndescribes not by outward features; all that it affirms, judges, or\r\ndescribes, it affirms from _within_. There is _no reasoning_ in it; it\r\nworks not by algebra nor by integral calculus; it is a piercing\r\nPholas-like mind's tongue that works and tastes into the very\r\nrock-heart; no matter what be the subject submitted to it, substance or\r\nspirit, all is alike divided asunder, joint and marrow; whatever utmost\r\ntruth, life, principle it has laid bare, and that which has no truth,\r\nlife, nor principle, is dissipated into its original smoke at a touch.\r\nThe whispers at men's ears it lifts into visible angels. Vials that have\r\nlain sealed in the sea a thousand years it unseals, and brings out of\r\nthem genii.\r\n\r\nEvery great conception of Art is held and treated by this faculty. Every\r\ncharacter touched by men like Æschylus, Homer, Dante, or Shakspeare, is\r\nby them held by the _heart_; and every circumstance or sentence of their\r\nbeing, speaking, or seeming, is seized by a process from _within_, and\r\nis referred to that inner secret spring of which the hold is never lost\r\nfor a moment; so that every sentence, as it has been thought out from\r\nthe heart, opens a way down to the heart, and leads us to the very\r\ncentre of life. Hence there is in every word set down by the Imagination\r\nan awful undercurrent of meaning--an evidence and shadow upon it of the\r\ndeep places out of which it has come.\r\n\r\nIn this it utterly differs from the Fancy, with which it is often\r\nconfounded.\r\n\r\nFancy sees the outside, and is able to give a portrait of the outside,\r\nclear, brilliant, and full of detail. The Imagination sees the heart and\r\ninner nature, and makes them felt; but in the clear seeing of things\r\nbeneath, is often impatient of detailed interpretation, being sometimes\r\nobscure, mysterious, and abrupt. Fancy, as she stays at the externals,\r\nnever feels. She is one of the hardest hearted of the intellectual\r\nfaculties; or, rather, one of the most purely and simply intellectual.\r\nShe cannot be made serious; no edge tools but she will play with; while\r\nthe Imagination cannot but be serious--she sees too far, too darkly, too\r\nsolemnly, too earnestly, to smile often! There is something in the heart\r\nof everything, if we can reach it, at which we shall not be inclined to\r\nlaugh. Those who have the deepest sympathies are those who pierce\r\ndeepest, and those who have so pierced and seen the melancholy deeps of\r\nthings, are filled with the most intense passion and gentleness of\r\nsympathy. The power of an imagination may almost be tested by its\r\naccompanying degree of tenderness; thus there is no tenderness like\r\nDante's, nor any seriousness like his--such seriousness that he is quite\r\nincapable of perceiving that which is commonplace or ridiculous.\r\n\r\nImagination, being at the heart of things, poises herself there, and is\r\nstill, calm, and brooding; but Fancy, remaining on the outside of\r\nthings, cannot see them all at once, but runs hither and thither, and\r\nround about, to see more and more, bounding merrily from point to point,\r\nglittering here and there, but necessarily always settling, if she\r\nsettle at all, on a _point_ only, and never embracing the whole. From\r\nthese simple points she can strike out analogies and catch resemblances,\r\nwhich are true so far as the point from which she looks is concerned,\r\nbut would be false, could she see through to the other side. This,\r\nhowever, she does not care to do--the point of contact is enough for,\r\nher; and even if there be a great gap between two things, she will\r\nspring from one to the other like an electric spark, and glitter the\r\nmost brightly in her leaping. Fancy loves to follow long chains of\r\ncircumstance from link to link; but the Imagination grasps a link in the\r\nmiddle that implies all the rest, and settles there.\r\n\r\n  'Bring the rathe primrose that forsaken dies,\r\n                                  [Imagination.\r\n\r\n  The tufted crowtoe and pale jessamine,\r\n                                     [Nugatory.\r\n\r\n  The white pink and the pansy streaked with jet,\r\n                                        [Fancy.\r\n\r\n  The glowing violet,\r\n                                  [Imagination.\r\n\r\n  The musk rose and the well attired woodbine,\r\n                                [Fancy, vulgar.\r\n\r\n  With cowslips wan that hang the pensive head,\r\n                                  [Imagination.\r\n\r\n  And every flower that sad embroidery wears.\r\n                                        [Mixed.\r\n\r\n                                      MILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      'Oh, Proserpina,\r\n  For the flowers now that frighted thou lett'st fall\r\n  From Dis's wagon. Daffodils\r\n  That come before the swallow dare, and take\r\n  The winds of March with beauty. Violets, dim,\r\n  But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes\r\n  Or Cytherea's breath; pale primroses\r\n  That die unmarried, ere they can behold\r\n  Bright Phoebus in his strength, a malady\r\n  Most incident to maids.'\r\n\r\nHere the Imagination goes into the inmost soul of every flower, after\r\nhaving touched them all with that heavenly timidness, the shadow of\r\nProserpine's; and, gilding them all with celestial gathering, never\r\nstops on their spots or their bodily shape; while Milton sticks in the\r\nstains upon them, and puts us off with that unhappy streak of jet in the\r\nvery flower that without this bit of paper staining would have been the\r\nmost precious to us of all.\r\n\r\n  'There is pansies--that's for thoughts.'\r\n\r\nCan the tender insight of the Imagination be more fully manifested than\r\nin the grief of Constance?\r\n\r\n  'And, father cardinal, I have heard you say\r\n  That we shall see and know our friends in heaven:\r\n  If that be true, I shall see my boy again;\r\n  For, since the birth of Cain, the first male child,\r\n  To him that did but yesterday suspire,\r\n  There was not such a gracious creature born.\r\n  But now will canker sorrow eat my bud,\r\n  And chase the native beauty from his cheek;\r\n  And he will look as hollow as a ghost,\r\n  As dim and meagre as an ague's fit;\r\n  And so he'll die; and, rising so again,\r\n  When I shall meet him in the court of heaven\r\n  I shall not know him: therefore, never--never--\r\n  Shall I behold my pretty Arthur more.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Grief fills the room up of my absent child,\r\n  Lies in his bed, walks up and down with me;\r\n  Puts on his pretty looks, repeats his words,\r\n  Remembers me of all his gracious parts,\r\n  Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form;\r\n  Then have I reason to be fond of grief.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  O lord, my boy, my Arthur, my fair son!\r\n  My life, my joy, my food, my all the world!\r\n  My widow-comfort and my sorrow's cure.'\r\n\r\nThis is the impassioned but simple eloquence of Nature, and Nature's\r\nchild: Shakspeare.\r\n\r\nIn these examples the reader will not fail to remark that the\r\nImagination seems to gain much of its power from its love for and\r\nsympathy with the objects described. Not only are the objects with which\r\nit presents us _truthfully_ rendered, but always _lovingly_ treated.\r\n\r\nWith the Greeks, the Graces were also the _Charities_ or _Loves_. It is\r\nthe love for living things and the sympathy felt in them that induce the\r\npoet to give life and feeling to the plant, as Shelley to the 'Sensitive\r\nPlant;' as Shakspeare, when he speaks to us through the sweet voices of\r\nOphelia and Perdita; as Wordsworth, in his poems to the Daisy, Daffodil,\r\nand Celandine; as Burns in his Mountain Daisy. As a proof of the power\r\nof the Imagination, through its _Truth,_ and _Love_, to invest the\r\nlowest of God's creatures with interest, we offer the reader one of\r\nthese simple songs of the heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO A MOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On turning her up in her nest with the plough,\r\nNovember, 1785._\r\n\r\n  Wee, sleekit, cow'rin, tim'rous beastie,\r\n  O, what a panic's in thy breastie!\r\n  Thou need na start awa sae hastie,\r\n                  Wi' bickering brattle!\r\n\r\n  I wad be laith to rin an' chase thee,\r\n                  Wi' murd'ring pattle!\r\n\r\n  I'm truly sorry man's dominion\r\n  Has broken nature's social union,\r\n  An' justifies that ill opinion\r\n                  Which makes thee startle\r\n  At me, thy poor earth-born companion\r\n                  An' fellow mortal!\r\n\r\n  I doubt na, whyles, but thou may thieve;\r\n  What then? poor beastie, thou maun live!\r\n  A daimen icher in a thrave\r\n                 'S a sma' request;\r\n  I'll get a blessin' wi' the lave\r\n                  An' never miss't!\r\n\r\n  Thy wee bit housie, too, in ruin!\r\n  Its silly wa's the win's are strewin'!\r\n  An' naething, now, to big anew ane,\r\n                  O' foppage green!\r\n  An' bleak December's winds ensuin',\r\n                  Baith snell and keen!\r\n\r\n  Thou saw the fields laid bare an' waste,\r\n  An' weary winter comin' fast,\r\n  An' cozie here beneath the blast,\r\n                  Thou thought to dwell,\r\n  Till crash! the cruel coulter past\r\n                  Out thro' thy cell.\r\n\r\n  That wee bit heap o' leaves an' stibble,\r\n  Has cost thee mony a weary nibble!\r\n  Now thou's turned out, for a' thy trouble,\r\n                  Nor house nor hald,\r\n  To thole the winter's sleety dribble\r\n                  An' cranreuch cold!\r\n\r\n  But, mousie, thou art no thy lane,\r\n  In proving foresight may be vain:\r\n  The best laid schemes o' mice an' men\r\n                  Gang aft agley,\r\n  An' lea'e us nought but grief an' pain,\r\n                  For promised joy.\r\n\r\n  Still thou art blest, compared with _me!_\r\n  The _present_ only toucheth thee:\r\n  But och! I _backward_ cast my e'e,\r\n                  On prospects drear;\r\n  An' _forward_, though I canna see,\r\n                  I guess and fear!\r\n\r\nPoor Burns! Seventy years and more have passed since that cold November\r\nmorning on which he sang this simple and tender song, yet it is as fresh\r\nin its rustic pathos, bathed in the quickening dews of the poet's heart,\r\nas if it had sprung from the soul but an hour since: and fresh it will\r\nstill be long after the fragile hand now tracing this tribute to the\r\nheart of love from which it flowed shall have been cold in an unknown\r\ngrave!\r\n\r\nSuch poems are worth folios of the erudite and stilted pages which are\r\nnow so rapidly pouring their scoria around us. Men seem ashamed now to\r\nbe simply natural. Either they have ceased to love, or to believe in the\r\ndignity of loving. The great barrier to all real greatness in this\r\npresent age of ours is the fear of ridicule, and the low and shallow\r\nlove of jest and jeer, so that if there be in any noble work a flaw or\r\nfailing, or unclipped vulnerable part where sarcasm may stick or stay,\r\nit is caught at, pointed at, buzzed about, and fixed upon, and stung\r\ninto, as a recent wound is by flies, and nothing is ever taken seriously\r\nor as it was meant, but always perverted and misunderstood. While this\r\nspirit lasts, there can be no hope of the achievement of high things,\r\nfor men will not open the secrets of their hearts to us, if we intend to\r\ndesecrate the holy, or to broil themselves upon a fire of thorns.\r\n\r\nAs the poet is full of love for all that God has made, because his\r\nimagination enables him to seize it by the heart, he would in this love\r\nfain gift the inanimate things of creation with life, that he might find\r\nin them that happiness which pertains to the living; hence the constant\r\n_personification_ of all that is in his pages. He personifies, he\r\nindividualizes, he gifts creation with life and passion, not willingly\r\nconsidering any creature as subordinate to any purpose quite out of\r\nitself, for then some of the pleasure he feels in its beauty is lost,\r\nfor his sense of its happiness is in that case destroyed, as its\r\nemanation of inherent life is no longer pure. Thus the bending trunk,\r\nwaving to and fro in the wind above the waterfall, is beautiful because\r\nit seems happy, though it is, indeed, perfectly useless to us. The same\r\ntrunk, hewn down and thrown across the stream, has lost its beauty. It\r\nserves as a bridge--_it has become useful_, it lives no longer _for\r\nitself_, and its pleasant beauty is gone, or that which it still retains\r\nis purely typical, dependent on its lines and colors, not on its\r\nfunctions. Saw it into planks, and though now fitted to become\r\npermanently _useful_, its whole beauty is lost forever, or is to be\r\nregained only in part, when decay and ruin shall have withdrawn it again\r\nfrom _use_, and left it to receive from the hand of Nature the velvet\r\nmoss and varied lichen, which may again suggest ideas of inherent\r\nhappiness, and tint its mouldering sides with hues of life. For the\r\nImagination, unperverted, is essentially _loving_, and abhors all\r\nutility based on the pain or destruction of any creature. It takes\r\ndelight in such ministering of objects to each other as is consistent\r\nwith the essence and energy of both, as in the clothing of the rock by\r\nthe herbage, and the feeding of the herbage by the stream.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the soul rejects exaggeration or falsehood in Art, and\r\nindeed all high Art, that which men will not suffer to perish, has no\r\nfood, no delight, no care, no perception, except of truth; it is forever\r\nlooking under masks and burning up mists; no fairness of form, no\r\nmajesty of seeming will satisfy it; the first condition of its existence\r\nis incapability of being deceived; and though it may dwell upon and\r\nsubstantiate the fictions of fancy, yet its peculiar operation is to\r\ntrace to their farthest limits the _true laws_ and likelihoods even of\r\nsuch fictitious creations.\r\n\r\nAs to its love, that is not only seen in its wish and struggle to\r\nquicken all with the warm throb of happy life, but is also clearly\r\nmanifested in the lingering over its creations with clinging fondness,\r\n'hating nothing that it maketh,' pruning, elaborating, and laboring to\r\ngift with beauty the works of its patient hands, finishing every line in\r\nlove, that it too may feel its creations to be 'good.' For Love not only\r\ngives wings, but also vital heat and life, to Genius.\r\n\r\nThus we again arrive at the fact that the two Divine attributes of Truth\r\nand Love, in their finite form indeed, but still 'images,' are\r\nabsolutely necessary for the creation of any true work of Art. No work\r\ncan be great without their manifestation; unless they have brooded with\r\ntheir silvery wings over its progress to perfection; and in exact\r\nproportion to their manifestation will be its greatness. On these two\r\nattributes in God repose in holy trust the universes He hath made; and\r\nthat which typifies or suggests His faithfulness and love to the soul\r\ncreated to enjoy Him, must be a source, not only of Beauty, but of\r\nDelight.\r\n\r\n     'For He made all things in wisdom; and Truth is perpetual and\r\n     immortal.'\r\n\r\n     'For Thou _lovest_ all things that are, and hatest none of the\r\n     things Thou hast made; for Thou didst not appoint or make anything,\r\n     hating it.'\r\n\r\nWe make no attempt to give an enumeration of the attributes on which\r\nBeauty is based; we would rather induce the reader to examine his\r\nMaker's great Book of Symbols for himself. We hope we have turned his\r\nattention to the fact that every Letter in this sacred Language is full\r\nof meaning; enough to induce him to investigate the glorious mysteries\r\nof the '_Open Secret_.'\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the decisions of the men of the senses, or the men of\r\nthe schools, let him fearlessly condemn any work in which he cannot find\r\nwrought into its very heart suggestions or manifestations of the Divine\r\nattributes, or an earnest effort on the part of its author, naive and\r\nunconscious as it may be, to imitate the Spirit of the Great Artist.\r\n\r\nWe have placed the Rosetta stone of Art, with its threefold inscriptions\r\nin Sculpture, Painting and Music, with their union or _resumé_ in\r\nPoetry, before him; we have given him the key to some of its wondrous\r\nhieroglyphics; let him study the remaining letters of this mystical\r\nalphabet for himself! These inscriptions are indeed trilingual,\r\nphonetic, and sacred, yet the simple and loving soul may decipher them\r\nwithout the genius of Champollion; their meaning is written within it.\r\nIt will readily learn to connect the sign with the thing signified, and\r\nunder the fleeting forms of rhythmed time and measured space, learn to\r\ndetect the immutable principles which are to be its glory and joy for\r\neternity!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCURRENCY AND THE NATIONAL FINANCES.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _History of the Bank of England, its Times and Traditions, from 1694\r\nto 1844._ By JOHN FRANCIS.

SMITH HOMANS, jr.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bank of England was created during the urgent necessities of\r\nnational finance. It was a concession of a valuable privilege to a few\r\nrich men, in consideration of their loaning the capital to the treasury.\r\n'The estimates of Government expenditure in the year 1694 were\r\nenormous,' says Macaulay, in his fourth volume. King William asked to\r\nhave the army increased to ninety-four thousand, at an annual expense of\r\nabout two and a half millions sterling--a small sum compared with what\r\nit costs in the year 1862 to maintain an army of equal numbers.\r\n\r\nAt the period of the charter of the bank, the minds of men were on the\r\nrack to conceive new sources of revenue with which to meet the increased\r\nexpenditures of the nation. The land tax was renewed at four shillings\r\nin the pound, and yielded a revenue of two millions. A poll tax was\r\nestablished. Stamp duties, which had prevailed in the time of Charles II\r\nhad been allowed to expire, but were now revived, and have ever since\r\nbeen among the most prolific sources of income, yielding to the British\r\nGovernment in the year 1862 no less than £8,400,000 sterling. Hackney\r\ncoaches were taxed, notwithstanding the outcries of the coachmen and the\r\nresistance of their wives, who assembled around Westminster Hall and\r\nmobbed the members. A new duty on salt was imposed, and finally resort\r\nwas had to the lottery, whereby one million sterling was raised. All\r\nthese resources were not sufficient for the growing wants of the\r\nGovernment, and the plan of the Bank of England was devised to furnish\r\nimmediate relief to the finances. Montague brought the measure forward\r\nin Parliament, and 'he succeeded,' as Macaulay remarks, 'not only in\r\nsupplying the wants of the state for twelve months, but in creating a\r\ngreat institution, which, after the lapse of more than a century and a\r\nhalf, continues to flourish, and which he lived to see the stronghold,\r\nthrough all vicissitudes, of the Whig party, and the bulwark, in\r\ndangerous times, of the Protestant succession.'\r\n\r\nThe birth of the bank and the birth of the English national debt were\r\nboth in King William's time. In 1691, when England was at war with\r\nFrance, the national debt unfunded was £3,130,000, at an annual interest\r\nof £232,000. In 1697, at the Peace of Ryswick, this debt had swollen to\r\n£14,522,000. At the Peace of Utrecht, in 1713, it had reached\r\n£34,000,000. The war with Spain in 1718 brought it up to forty millions\r\nsterling. And here it might have rested, had the advice of Shakspeare\r\nbeen followed:\r\n\r\n  'Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace.'\r\n\r\nBut England went to war with Spain 'on the right of search.' From 1691\r\nto this time the debt had increased on an average about a million\r\nsterling per year. As early as 1745 the credit of the bank was so\r\nidentified with that of the state, that during the invasion of the\r\nPretender, whose forces were at Derby, only one hundred and twenty miles\r\nfrom London, the creditors of the bank flocked in crowds to its counter\r\nto obtain specie for its notes. The merchants intervened and signed an\r\nagreement to make the bank's notes receivable in all business\r\ntransactions.\r\n\r\nThe war of the Austrian succession followed in 1742, and at the Peace of\r\nAix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, 'forever to be maintained,' the English were\r\nsaddled with a debt of £75,000,000.\r\n\r\n  'Peace hath her victories,\r\n  No less renowned than war.'\r\n\r\nIt was early in the last century that the abuse of paper money gave a\r\nlasting and unfavorable impression against such issues. The scheme of\r\nJohn Law and the South Sea Bubble about the same time broke and\r\nscattered their fragments over both England and France. It was in the\r\nlatter scheme or folly that Pope lost a large portion of his earnings,\r\nfrom which we may infer that his temper was not improved. He wrote, in\r\nhis Third Epistle, dedicated to Lord Bathurst:\r\n\r\n  'Statesman and patriot ply alike the stocks;\r\n  Peeress and butler share alike the box;\r\n  And judges job, and bishops bite the town,\r\n  And mighty dukes pack cards for half a crown.'\r\n\r\nIn the same 'Moral Essay' he alludes to paper money in the following\r\nlines:\r\n\r\n  'Blest paper credit! last and best supply!\r\n  That lends corruption lighter wings to fly!\r\n  Gold imp'd by thee, can compass hardest things,\r\n  Can pocket states, can fetch or carry kings;\r\n  A single leaf shall waft an army o'er,\r\n  Or ship off senates to a distant shore;\r\n  A leaf, like Sibyl's, scatter to and fro\r\n  Our fates and fortunes, as the winds shall blow:\r\n  Pregnant with thousands flits the scrap unseen,\r\n  And silent sells a king, or buys a queen.'\r\n\r\nThese are among the earliest tirades against paper money; which, like\r\nmany other good things, is condemned because its power has been abused\r\nand prostituted.\r\n\r\nEngland's enormous debt, which should have warned the Georges against\r\nfurther war, was not contracted without severe sacrifices. The legal\r\nrate of interest at the opening of the funding system was six per cent.\r\nIn 1714 it was reduced to five per cent. Loans during the early wars of\r\nthe eighteenth century were raised on annuities for lives on very high\r\nterms, fourteen per cent. being granted for single lives, twelve per\r\ncent. for two lives, and ten per cent. for three lives. But so far was\r\nEngland from being awake to the enormous debt she was creating by her\r\nexpensive wars, that the seventy-five millions existing in 1748 became\r\n£132,000,000 at the close of the Seven Years' War in 1763. This volume\r\nwas enlarged at the end of the American Revolution to £231,000,000.\r\nDuring all this time the bank was the lever with which these enormous\r\nsums were raised; but the end was not yet.\r\n\r\nThe French war with Napoleon became more exhaustive, and within twenty\r\nyears from the peace with America to the Peace of Amiens, in 1802, the\r\ndebt went up from £231,000,000 to £537,000,000 sterling. From this\r\nperiod to 1815 the debt accumulated annually, until it reached its\r\nmaximum, or eight hundred and sixty-one millions sterling.\r\n\r\nDuring these severe changes, reverses, extravagance, and extraordinary\r\ngovernmental expenditure, the bank was considered the prop of national\r\nfinance. The French Revolution and its consequent war with England led\r\nto many heavy outlays by the British Government. In 1795 the bank\r\ndesired the chancellor of the exchequer to make his arrangements for the\r\nyear without 'any further assistance' from the bank. This was again\r\nurged in 1796, and the bank appealed again to Mr. Pitt.\r\n\r\n     'The only reply from Mr. Pitt was a request for a further\r\n     accommodation, on the credit of the consolidated fund, which the\r\n     court refused to sanction, until they had received satisfaction on\r\n     the topic of the treasury bills, and requested Mr. Pitt to enter\r\n     into a full explanation on this subject, which was not even touched\r\n     upon in his letter. This resolution being communicated, Mr. Pitt\r\n     wrote to the governor and deputy-governor on the 12th August, that\r\n     'they might depend upon measures being immediately taken for the\r\n     payment of one million, and a further payment, to the amount of one\r\n     million, being made in September, October, and November, in such\r\n     proportions as might be found convenient. But, as fresh bills might\r\n     arrive, he was under the necessity of requesting a latitude to an\r\n     amount not exceeding one million.' About the same period the court\r\n     'desired the governor and deputy-governor would express their\r\n     earnest desire that some other means might be adopted for the\r\n     future payment of bills of exchange drawn on the treasury.' (_Vide_\r\n     'History Bank of England,' pp. 114, 115.)\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of the nation and of the bank were known to the\r\ncapitalists and to the people. Hence various causes of uneasiness and\r\ndistress. The bank loaned the public treasury seven and a half millions\r\nin the years 1794, 1795, 1796, and the more they loaned to the\r\nexchequer, the less they could loan to the people. Thus followed a\r\ndiminution of gold in the bank, and hoarding by the people. Gold was\r\nexported more freely to the Continent, and reduced accommodation was\r\ngiven to the merchants. Finally, on the 26th February, 1797, the king's\r\ncouncil passed an order for the suspension of cash payments.\r\n\r\nThe bank was on the eve of suspension in the year 1847. On the 25th of\r\nOctober the cabinet authorized a violation of the charter, thereby\r\nacknowledging the inability of the bank to maintain specie payments.\r\nThis order of Lord John Russell inspired fresh confidence, and the bank\r\nimmediately recovered strength, and reduced the rate of interest from 8\r\nper cent. in October to 7 per cent. in November, to 6 and 5 per cent. in\r\nDecember, to 4 per cent. in January, and to 3-1/2 in June following. The\r\ndistress and revulsion of 1847 were consequent upon the over-trading\r\nand railway mania of 1844, 1845, and 1846, and the failure of crops in\r\nIreland and England in 1847.\r\n\r\nThe distress of England in 1847 was scarcely over when France was more\r\nseverely affected than at any period since the Continental War. Louis\r\nPhilippe abdicated in February, 1848, when consols closed at 88-7/8. By\r\nthe close of the week they fell to 83, upon the formation of a\r\nprovisional government. The political dissensions and commercial\r\nrevulsion led to a large withdrawal of gold from the Bank of France, and\r\nfinally the Government authorized, in March, the suspension of the bank,\r\nwhich was followed by the suspension of the Bank of Belgium and by the\r\n_Société Generale_.\r\n\r\nAgain, in 1857, the Bank of England was on the verge of suspension. Lord\r\nPalmerston and the then cabinet issued an order, November 12,\r\nauthorizing the bank, if they thought it advisable, again to violate the\r\ncharter; but it was found at the last moment unnecessary.\r\n\r\nNovember was the critical period of the year 1857. The _Times_ of\r\nNovember 12, 1857, contained these announcements:\r\n\r\n1. Bank charter suspended.\r\n\r\n2. Interest in London, 10 per cent.\r\n\r\n3.    \"     in Hamburg, 10 per cent.\r\n\r\n4.    \"     in Paris, 8-1/2 per cent.\r\n\r\n5.    \"     in New York, 25 per cent.\r\n\r\n6. Suspension of cash payments generally\r\nby all banks in the United States.\r\n\r\n7. Two banks stopped in Glasgow,\r\nand one in Liverpool, and a great bill\r\npanic in London.\r\n\r\n8. Commercial credit and transactions\r\nalmost suspended in the country.\r\n\r\n9. Bullion in the bank, £7,170,000.\r\n\r\n10. Reserve notes in the bank, £975,000.\r\n\r\n11. Bank liabilities, £40,875,000.\r\n\r\n     'One gentleman, during the heat of the excitement at Glasgow, went\r\n     into the Union Bank and presented a check for £500. The teller\r\n     asked him if he wished gold. 'Gold!' replied he, 'no; give me\r\n     notes, and let the fools who are frightened get the gold,' Another\r\n     gentleman rushed into the same bank in a great state of excitement,\r\n     with a check for £1,400. On being asked if he wished gold he\r\n     replied, 'Yes.' 'Well,' said the teller, 'there is £1,000 in that\r\n     bag and £400 in this one.' The gentleman was so flurried by the\r\n     readiness with which the demand was granted that he lifted up the\r\n     bag with the £400 only, and walked off, leaving the £1,000 on the\r\n     counter. The teller, on discovering the bag, laid it aside for the\r\n     time. Late in the day the gentleman returned to the bank in great\r\n     distress, stating he had lost the bag with the £1,000, and could\r\n     not tell whether he dropped it in the crowd or left it behind him\r\n     on leaving the bank. 'Oh, you left it on the counter,' said the\r\n     teller, quietly, 'and if you call to-morrow you will get your\r\n     £1,000.' (_Vide_ 'History Bank of England,' p. 429.)\r\n\r\nThe facts and statistics from the year 1844 to 1860 relating to the bank\r\nare superadded to the English work by the American editor. Of the\r\nimportant phases of this period the editor gives a slight sketch in the\r\nfollowing paragraphs. The prominent financial movements in England,\r\nFrance, and the United States are given in the subsequent pages of the\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\n     'The sixteen years which followed the last charter of the bank have\r\n     been pregnant with important events of a financial character; the\r\n     most important, perhaps, during the whole history of the\r\n     institution. The bank has twice, during this short period, been on\r\n     the brink of suspension, and was relieved only by the interference\r\n     of Government. The second instance occurred after new gold, to the\r\n     extent of one hundred millions sterling, or more, had been poured\r\n     into Western Europe from California and Australia. The Bank of\r\n     France had, during the same period, suspended specie payment. Two\r\n     financial revulsions have occurred in the United States, when, with\r\n     few exceptions, the banks of the whole country suspended specie\r\n     payments. The production of gold and silver throughout the world,\r\n     which, up to 1844, was annually about ten or twelve millions\r\n     sterling, had recently advanced from twenty-five to thirty millions\r\n     sterling per annum, thus stimulating industry and production\r\n     largely throughout Europe and America. Sir Robert Peel, the author\r\n     of the new charter of the bank, has left the world's stage, after\r\n     witnessing the failure of the charter to fully accomplish the end\r\n     promised; Europe and America, Asia and Europe, have been knit\r\n     together by a wire cord, and capital is now subscribed to\r\n\r\n         'Put a girdle round about the earth,'\r\n\r\n     whereby London may speak to San Francisco (the prospective\r\n     commercial centre of the world) in less than '_forty minutes_.'\r\n     During the same short space of sixteen years the suspended States\r\n     of this Union (five at least) have resumed payment of their\r\n     obligations; two violent wars, with sundry revolutions, have\r\n     occurred in Europe; the ancient city of the Cortez has been\r\n     conquered by the 'hordes of the North,' and magnanimously given up\r\n     by the captors to the possession of their weaker enemy, and\r\n     millions were paid to the latter for portions of their territory;\r\n     the northwest passage of the American continent has been\r\n     discovered; steam has accomplished wonders between Europe and\r\n     America, and between Europe and their distant colonies of Asia,\r\n     Africa, and Australia; Ireland has been on the verge of\r\n     starvation,[6] when 600,000 of her people died from hunger alone\r\n     and its effects, and her population was reduced two millions by\r\n     emigration and privation; England's minister has been expelled from\r\n     the capital of the United States; speculation has been rife in\r\n     Europe and America, and its inevitable effects, revulsion and\r\n     bankruptcy, have followed in its train; the railway and the\r\n     telegraph have brought remote regions together; China, with her\r\n     four hundred millions of people, has been conquered by the united\r\n     forces of the English and the French.\r\n\r\n     'The Bank of England, instead of pursuing one even course, with a\r\n     view to permanent commercial interests, has unfortunately, and, we\r\n     fear, from selfish and individual views, fostered speculation by\r\n     reducing her rate of discount to 2 per cent., and soon after, but\r\n     too late, discovered the error, and forced her borrowers to pay\r\n     from 6 to 10 per cent.\r\n\r\n     'We propose to give the leading events of each year, from 1844 to\r\n     1861, referring the reader to authorities where more copious\r\n     information can be gained by those who wish to study the invariable\r\n     connection between commerce and money.\r\n\r\n     'The bank shares in the depressed period of 1847-8 fell to 180,\r\n     after having reached, in the flattering times of 1844-'5, 215 per\r\n     share, or 115 per cent. advance. Consols, at the same depressed\r\n     period, fell to 78-3/4, when starvation stared Ireland in its face,\r\n     and the bank simultaneously sought protection from the Cabinet.'\r\n\r\nAttention has been recently directed in this country to the premium on\r\ngold, or to the alleged fall in the value of bank paper and Government\r\nnotes. Although the premium on gold as an article of merchandise has\r\nreached a high rate during the present year, it will be seen, on\r\nreference to the reliable tables in the History of the Bank of England,\r\nthat a great difference occurred during the suspension of the bank in\r\n1797 to 1819. Gold at one time (1812) reached £5 8_s._, a difference of\r\n30 per cent.

During the four years\r\n1813 to 1816, when war raged with England, the whole expenses of the\r\nGovernment were $108,537,000. During the Mexican war, when the\r\ndisbursements of the treasury were much heavier, the average annual\r\nexpenses of the Government were about 35 to 48 millions. It will be well\r\nto recur to these tabular details for future history. They are presented\r\nas follows, for the whole period of the General Government.\r\n\r\nEXPENDITURES _of the United States, exclusive of Payments on account of\r\nthe Public Debt._\r\n\r\nYears 1789-1792,  Washington,           $3,797,000\r\n  \"   1793-1796,      \"                 12,083,000\r\n  \"   1797-1800,  John Adams,           21,338,000\r\n  \"   1800-1804,  Jefferson,            17,174,000\r\n  \"   1805-1808,      \"                 23,927,000\r\n  \"   1809-1812,  Madison,              36,147,000\r\n  \"   1813-1816,     \"                 108,537,000\r\n  \"   1817-1821,  Monroe,               58,698,000\r\n  \"   1821-1824,    \"                   45,665,000\r\n  \"   1825-1828,  John Quincy Adams,    49,313,000\r\n  \"   1829-1832,  Jackson,              56,249,000\r\n  \"   1833-1836,     \"                  87,130,000\r\n  \"   1837-1840,  Van Buren,           112,188,000\r\n  \"   1841-1844,  Harrison and Tyler,   81,216,000\r\n  \"   1846-1848,  Polk,                146,924,000\r\n  \"   1849-1852,  Taylor and Fillmore, 194,647,000\r\n  \"   1853-1856,  Pierce,              211,099,000\r\n  \"   1857-1860,  Buchanan,            262,974,000\r\n\r\nDuring the past fiscal year, 1862-3 and the year 1863-4, the Government\r\nexpenditures are estimated at ten hundred millions of dollars. These\r\nheavy disbursements cannot be carried on merely by the ordinary bank\r\npaper and the gold and silver of the country. Instead of sixty-five\r\nmillions of dollars, the average annual expenditures of the Government\r\nduring the last administration, these now involve the sum of five\r\nhundred millions annually. Hence the obvious obligation on the part of\r\nthe Government of putting in circulation the most reliable currency, and\r\nof avoiding those of local banks, which do not possess the confidence of\r\nthe people at a distance. This can be done only by maintaining a\r\ncurrency of Government paper which every holder will have full\r\nconfidence in, and in which no loss can be sustained.\r\n\r\nThere is here no conflict or competition between the Government and the\r\nState banks. The latter have the benefit of their legitimate circulation\r\nin their own respective localities; while the national treasury\r\nfurnishes to the troops and to the creditors of the nation a circulation\r\nof treasury notes which must possess confidence as long as the\r\nGovernment lasts.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the English Government in this respect was a wise one. At\r\nthe adoption of the last charter of the bank (1844) the Government\r\nallowed the country banks to maintain from that time forward the\r\ncirculation then outstanding, which was not to be increased; and as fast\r\nas the banks failed or were wound up voluntarily, their circulation was\r\nretired and the vacuum became filled by the notes of the Bank of\r\nEngland. The latter was forbidden by its new charter to exceed certain\r\nprescribed limits in its issues. They could issue to the amount of their\r\ncapital, £14,000,000, and beyond that to the extent of gold in the\r\nvaults. Thus the bank circulation of England, Scotland, and Ireland is\r\nless now than in 1844, when the new principle was established, viz.:\r\n\r\nBANK CIRCULATION.\r\n\r\n      Bank of England. Country Banks.  Ireland.   Scotland.  TOTAL.\r\n\r\n1844,   £22,015,000     £7,797,000    £7,716,000 £3,804,000 £41,325,000\r\n1862,    20,190,000      5,680,000     5,519,000  4,053,000  35,442,000\r\n\r\nHad this principle been adopted in the United States at the same\r\nperiod, the excesses and extravagance of 1856-'7 might have been\r\nobviated, as well as the revulsion of the latter year, and the distress\r\nwhich followed.\r\n\r\nLet us recur to the eventful history of the bank. Although a private\r\ninstitution, owned and controlled by private capital, its large profits\r\naccruing for the benefit of its own shareholders, yet it became so\r\nclosely interwoven with the commerce, manufactures, trade, and the\r\npublic finances of the nation, that it may be considered as in reality a\r\nnational institution. At its inception its whole capital was swallowed\r\nby the treasury. This was a part of the contract of charter. Its\r\nsubsequent accumulations of capital, from £1,200,000, have likewise been\r\nabsorbed by the Government, until now the bank reports the Government\r\ndebt to them to be £11,015,100, and the Government securities held, to\r\nbe £11,064,000. Without the aid of the bank, the national treasury could\r\nnot, probably, have made the enormous disbursements which were actually\r\nmade between the commencement of the American Revolution in 1776, and\r\nthe termination of the continental war of 1815. The bank here furnished,\r\nalmost alone, 'the sinews of war.'\r\n\r\nDuring this eventful period there were large numbers of provincial banks\r\nof issue created in England and Ireland. These were managed mainly with\r\na view to private profit, while the public interests have suffered\r\nseverely from the frequent expansions and contractions of the volume of\r\nthe currency through such private management, and from the numerous\r\nfailures of these concerns. The evils of this system were for many years\r\nthe subject of discussion in Parliament and among prominent journals. In\r\n1826 the Edinburgh _Review_ expressed the opinion that\r\n\r\n     'So long, therefore, as any individual, or association of\r\n     individuals, may issue notes of a low value, to be used in the\r\n     common transactions of life, without lodging any security for their\r\n     ultimate payment, so long is it _certain_ that those panics which\r\n     must necessarily occur every now and then, and against which no\r\n     effectual precaution can be devised, must occasion the destruction\r\n     of a greater or smaller number of banking establishments, and by\r\n     consequence a ruinous fluctuation in the supply and value of\r\n     money.' (_Edinburgh Review_, February, 1826.)\r\n\r\nThis was a period of great speculation in England. In the year 1823 no\r\nless than 532 companies were chartered, with a nominal capital of 441\r\nmillions sterling. These speculations were fostered by the increasing\r\nvolume of bank paper. The evil increased, and was allowed to exist until\r\nthe year 1844, when a stop was put to the further increase of the volume\r\nof bank circulation, and to the further incorporation of joint stock\r\nbanks.\r\n\r\nWe learn one lesson here, which may have a good effect upon us if we\r\nwill bear it in mind in our future legislation, and take warning from\r\nthe experiences of our contemporaries. We allude to the obvious\r\nnecessity in a country like ours, and, indeed, in any country, of\r\nmaintaining a national moneyed institution as a check upon the\r\nvacillation, expansions, and contractions which mark the policy of small\r\nbanks of issue. This national institution, while free from individual\r\nprofit, and without power to grant individual favors, should create and\r\nperform the functions of a national currency, and execute all the\r\ndetails required by or for the national treasury. Its chief utility\r\nwould be as a check upon the excess to which all joint stock banks are\r\nliable--a sort of controlling and conservative power to prevent that\r\nmischief which our past experience shows has been the result of paper\r\nmoney when issued merely for private gain.\r\n\r\nThe advantage, the convenience, we may say the _necessity_, of a\r\nnational circulation of paper money, are fully demonstrated by our own\r\npast history, and by the history of European nations. This circulation\r\nshould be dictated by the wants of the National Government, and\r\nconvertible, at the will of the holder, into specie. With these obvious\r\nrestraints it would accomplish its ends and aims.\r\n\r\nThe Bank of England, in its early stages, was endangered by various and\r\nextraordinary circumstances. Within three years of its establishment it\r\nwas compelled to suspend payment to its depositors in cash, and issued\r\ncertificates therefor payable ten per cent. every fortnight. In 1709 the\r\nSacheverell riots occurred in London, and fears were felt that the bank\r\nwould be sacked; but this violence was obviated by well-trained troops.\r\nIn 1718 John Law's bank was established in France, and for two years\r\nkept the people in a ferment. This was followed by the South Sea scheme\r\nin England, in 1720, 'a year (the historian Anderson says) remarkable\r\nbeyond any other which can be pitched upon for extraordinary and\r\nromantic projects.' The bank, of course, suffered by these speculative\r\nmeasures, and was repeatedly exposed to a run upon its specie resources.\r\n\r\nIn 1722 the _rest_ (or reserve fund) was established by the bank, as a\r\nmeasure to cover extraordinary losses in the future, and to inspire more\r\nconfidence among the public as to the ability of the bank to meet\r\nreverses. This fund, in July, 1862, had accumulated to £3,132,500\r\nsterling, or about twenty-one and a half per cent. of the capital.\r\n\r\nThe first forged note of the Bank of England was presented in the year\r\n1758, or sixty-four years after the bank was established. In 1780 these\r\nforgeries became more numerous, and were so well executed as to deceive\r\nthe officers of the bank.\r\n\r\nLet us now recur to some of the incidents connected with the bank in\r\nearly ages. Of these, the author, Mr. Francis, furnishes numerous\r\ninstances.\r\n\r\nAmong other frauds upon the bank was that of clipping the guineas, by\r\none of the clerks employed in the bullion office. This occurred in 1767.\r\n\r\nThe forgery of its notes having been made a capital offence, the waste\r\nof life in consequence was severe. During the eight years, 1795 to 1803,\r\nthere were one hundred and forty executions for this crime; and two\r\nhundred and nine between 1795 and 1809; and from 1797 to 1811 the\r\nexecutions were 469. 'The visible connection between the issue of small\r\nnotes and the effusion of blood, is one of the most frightful parts of\r\nthis case.'\r\n\r\nIn 1803 a fraud on the bank to the extent of £320,000 was perpetrated by\r\nMr. Robert Astlett, a cashier of the bank. This was in the re-issue of\r\nexchequer bills that had been previously redeemed, but which were not\r\ncancelled. This fraud amounted to about 2-1/2 per cent. of the capital,\r\nand although it did not prevent a dividend, it prevented the\r\ndistribution of a bonus which would otherwise have been paid to the\r\nshareholders.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1822 another fraud on the bank came to light. This was\r\nperpetrated by a bookkeeper, and amounted to £10,000. In 1824 the fraud\r\nof Mr. Fauntleroy on the bank was discovered, amounting to £360,000.\r\nThis was done by forged powers of attorney for the transfer of\r\nGovernment consols.\r\n\r\nThe bank was brought near suspension again in 1825 by the imprudent\r\nexpansion of its notes. After the resumption of specie payments in\r\n1820-'21, the true policy of the bank would have been to maintain an\r\neven tenor of its way; instead of which it increased its circulation\r\ntwenty-five per cent. in the year 1825 (or from £18,292,000 to\r\n£25,709,000), while the issues of the country banks were equally\r\nenlarged, giving encouragement to violent speculation among the people.\r\nThe specie reserve of the Bank of England fell from £14,200,000 in\r\nJanuary 1824 to £1,024,000 in December, 1825. This difficulty of the\r\nbank was relieved by the issue of a few thousand bills of £1 and £2.\r\n\r\nSpeculation had been rife in 1824; no less than 624 companies were\r\nstarted with a nominal capital of £372,000,000, including mining, gas,\r\ninsurance, railroad, steam, building, trading, provision, and other\r\ncompanies. At the same time foreign loans were contracted in England to\r\nthe extent of £32,000,000, of which over three fourths were advanced in\r\ncash.\r\n\r\nThe country banks of England had increased their circulation from\r\n£9,920,000 in 1823 to £14,980,000 in 1825, or over fifty per cent., thus\r\nstimulating prices, and promoting speculation widely throughout the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nImmediately following the revulsion at the close of the year 1825, Mr.\r\nHuskisson's free trade policy was advocated in the House of Commons by a\r\nvote of 223 to 40. In the same year lotteries were suppressed in\r\nEngland. In 1828 branches of the Bank of England were established--a\r\nmeasure, of course, unpopular among the provincial joint stock banks.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1832-'3 were brought forward three important measures in\r\nParliament. One was the abolishment of the death penalty for forgery;\r\nanother was the modification of the usury laws; the third was the\r\nre-charter of the bank.\r\n\r\nThe last criminal executed for forgery was a man by the name of Maynard,\r\nin December, 1829. Public sentiment had long been opposed to the\r\ninfliction of this punishment for the offence of forgery, and\r\ntransportation was now substituted in the prominent cases. England, at\r\nthe same time, opened the way for a gradual abolishment of the usury\r\nlaws. At first the relief was extended to short commercial paper,\r\nafterward to all paper having not over twelve months to run, 1837; and\r\nfinally, in 1854, the usury laws were removed from all negotiable paper,\r\nas well as from bonds and mortgages.\r\n\r\nBy the new charter of 1833, Bank of England notes were, for the first\r\ntime, made a legal tender, except at the bank itself. Joint stock banks\r\nwere authorized in the metropolis, but were prohibited from issuing\r\nnotes.\r\n\r\nThe English work of Mr. Francis is anecdotical in its character. The\r\nAmerican edition conveys to the reader, for the first time, a resumé of\r\nthe leading movements in Parliament on the subject of the bank, and its\r\nclose connection with the Government finances. The part which Mr. Pitt,\r\nMr. Canning, Sir Robert Peel, and other distinguished statesmen took in\r\nthe relations between the bank and the exchequer, is in the\r\nsupplementary portion of the new edition shown, as well as the views of\r\nLord Althorpe, Lord Ashburton, Lord Geo. Bentinck, Mr. Thomas Baring,\r\nLord Brougham, Mr. Gilbart, Sir James Graham, Lord King, Earl of\r\nLiverpool, Jones Loyd, Lord Lyndhurst, Mr. Rothschild, and others who\r\nexercised a large influence over the monetary interests of their day.\r\n\r\nIn the consideration of the banking and currency questions of the day\r\nand of the last and present century, it is desirable to have thus\r\nbrought together in a single work, a continuous history of the\r\ninstitution which has had so large an influence upon the public\r\ninterests of Europe, and a review of the important circumstances which\r\nmarked the progress of the bank in its successful efforts to sustain\r\nEngland against foreign enemies and domestic revulsions, an index to the\r\nspeculative movements of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when\r\ncommerce, trade, and the vast monetary interests of Europe and America\r\nhave been unnecessarily and cruelly involved.\r\n\r\nThe letter addressed by Secretary Chase, of the Treasury Department, to\r\nthe chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, and to the chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance,\r\nunder date June 7th, 1862, suggested the power by Congress to the\r\ntreasury to issue $150,000,000 in treasury notes, in addition to this\r\nsum, authorized by the act of February 25th, 1862; also, authority to\r\nreceive fifty millions of dollars on deposit, in addition to fifty\r\nmillions previously authorized by Congress. These suggestions were\r\nfavorably considered in both Houses, and the recommendations of the\r\nSecretary were adopted fully, leading to the adoption of a national\r\nsystem of finance, which will eventually reëstablish and preserve\r\nnational credit. Fears have been expressed in some quarters that this\r\nincreased volume of paper money would be a public evil, and serve to\r\ndisturb the value of property and the price of labor. This might be\r\nreasonably anticipated if the country were at peace, and the Government\r\nexpenditures were upon a peace footing.\r\n\r\nBut a state of things exists now in this country hitherto unknown. The\r\ncontracts of the Government involve the expenditure of larger sums than\r\nwere ever paid before in the same space of time by this or any other\r\nGovernment. In the disbursements of these large sums it is an obvious\r\nduty of Congress to provide a national circulation of uniform value\r\nthroughout the whole country--a circulation of a perfectly reliable\r\ncharacter, not subject in the least to the ordinary vicissitudes of\r\ntrade or to the revulsions which have frequently marked our history.\r\nThese revulsions have been witnessed, and their results seen by the\r\nleading public men of the century. Mr. Madison saw at an early day the\r\nimportance of creating and sustaining a government circulation. His\r\nlanguage was: 'It is essential to every modification of the finances\r\nthat the benefits of an uniform national currency should be restored to\r\nthe community.'\r\n\r\nMr. Calhoun, in 1816, said: 'By a sort of undercurrent, the power of\r\nCongress to regulate the money of the country has caved in, and upon its\r\nruin have sprung up those institutions which now exercise the right of\r\nmaking money in and for the United States.'\r\n\r\n'It is the duty of government,' says a well known writer, 'to interfere\r\nto regulate every business or pursuit that might otherwise become\r\npublicly injurious. On this principle it interferes to prevent the\r\ncirculation of spurious coin.' Counterfeit coin is more readily detected\r\nthan a fictitious paper currency, yet no sane man would advocate the\r\nrepeal of the laws which prohibit it. Why, then, permit the unlimited\r\nmanufacture of paper money of an unreliable character?\r\n\r\nIn the consideration of this subject we should divest ourselves of all\r\nselfish views of private profit and advantage. We should look only to\r\nthe public good, to stability in trade and commerce, and to the general\r\ninterests of the people at large as distinguished from those of a few\r\nindividuals. It is clearly then the province of government to establish\r\nand to regulate the paper money of the nation, so that it shall possess\r\nthe following attributes:\r\n\r\nI. To be uniform in value throughout all portions of the country.\r\n\r\nII. To be perfectly reliable at all times as a medium for the payment of\r\ndebts.\r\n\r\nIII. To be issued in limited amounts, and under the control of the\r\nGovernment only.\r\n\r\nIV. To be convertible, at the pleasure of the holder, into gold or\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\nIt must be conceded that these requisites do not belong, and never can\r\nbelong, to paper issued by joint stock banks, which are governed with a\r\nview to the largest profit, and which are but little known beyond their\r\nown immediate localities.\r\n\r\nRecent history assures us that abuses have been practised in reference\r\nto the bank circulation of the country, which have led to violent\r\nrevulsions and severe loss. England experienced the same results between\r\nthe years 1790 and 1840, and to such an extent that in the year 1844 her\r\nstatesmen devised a system whereby no further expansion of paper money\r\nshould occur. The amount then existing was assumed to be a minimum of\r\nthe amount required for commercial transactions, and it was ordered that\r\nall bank issues beyond that sum shall be represented by a deposit of\r\ngold.\r\n\r\nIf the Bank of England had been governed by considerations of public\r\nwelfare, and not by those of private interest, it would not have reduced\r\nthe rate of interest to 2-1/2 per cent. in 1844-'5, thus producing\r\nviolent speculation, and leading to the revulsion of 1849. Nor would the\r\nbank have established low rates of interest only in the year 1857, thus\r\nleading this powerful institution to the verge of bankruptcy, and to the\r\nclemency of the British Cabinet in November of that year.\r\n\r\nEngland has checked the paper circulation of the country, but has not\r\nwithdrawn from the bank the power to promote speculation by extravagant\r\nloans at a low rate of discount.\r\n\r\nThe Governments of France and England have both assumed control of the\r\npaper currency of their respective countries. This is sound policy, and\r\nit is one of the prerogatives that must be exercised, in its full force,\r\nby the Government of the United States and by all other governments, if\r\nstability, permanency, consistency are to be observed or maintained for\r\nthe people. This is obviously necessary in a time of peace and\r\nprosperity; it is perhaps more so in a time of rebellion or war, like\r\nthe present. Circumstances may arise where it will be the course of\r\nwisdom and safety to suspend specie payment; and, in some extreme\r\nexigencies, to forbid the export of specie.\r\n\r\nThis position was well explained by Mr. J.W. Gilbart, manager of the\r\nLondon and Westminster Bank, who, in his testimony before Sir Robert\r\nPeel, in 1843, said, 'If I were prime minister, I would immediately, on\r\nthe commencement of war, issue an order in council for the bank to stop\r\npayment. I stated also that I spoke as a politician, not as a banker.\r\n* * * I came to the conclusion that, under the circumstances of the war of\r\n1797, a suspension of cash payments was not a matter of choice, _but of\r\nnecessity_.' (_Vide_ 'History of the Bank of England,' New York edition,\r\np. 130.)\r\n\r\nWe come now to consider what is necessary, in order to restore the\r\ncurrency of the United States to a specie footing. This restoration is\r\ndemanded alike by motives of justice and sound policy. No contracts can\r\nbe well entered into, unless the currency of the country is upon a\r\nsubstantial and permanent footing of redemption. It is a matter which\r\nconcerns every individual in the community; it is especially so to the\r\nGeneral Government in view of its extraordinary expenditures: and no\r\ncommercial prosperity can be maintained without it.\r\n\r\nA restoration of public and private credit can be accomplished only by\r\nan observance of those sound principles of finance that have been\r\nannounced by the wise men of our own and other countries. Mr. Alexander\r\nHamilton, Mr. Gallatin, Mr. Jefferson, Mr. Madison, each in his turn\r\nadvocated a national institution, by which the currency of the country\r\ncould be placed upon a reliable and permanent footing. Such an\r\ninstitution should control the currency and receive surplus capital on\r\ndeposit; but need not interfere with the legitimate operations of the\r\nState banks as borrowers and lenders of money, nor encourage in the\r\nslightest degree, through loans, any speculative movements among the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nIn the next place our people must resort to and maintain more economy in\r\ntheir individual expenditure, and thus preserve a balance of foreign\r\ntrade in our own favor. It is shown that, during the fiscal year ending\r\n30 June, 1860, there were imported into the United States goods, wholly\r\nmanufactured, of the value of ... $166,073,000, partially manufactured,\r\n62,720,000.\r\n\r\nWe can dispense with two thirds of such articles during our present\r\nnational reverses, and rely upon our own domestic labor for similar\r\nproducts, viz.:\r\n\r\n  Manufactures of Wool,                       $37,937,000\r\n      \"        of Silk,                        32,948,000\r\n      \"        of Cotton,                      32,558,000\r\n      \"        of Flax,                        10,736,000\r\n  Laces and Embroideries,                       4,017,000\r\n  Gunny Cloths, Mattings,                       2,386,000\r\n  Clothing,                                     2,101,000\r\n  Iron, and Manufactures of Iron and Steel,    18,694,000\r\n  China and Earthenware,                        4,387,000\r\n  Clocks, Chronometers, Watches,                2,890,000\r\n  Boots, Shoes, and Gloves,                     2,230,000\r\n  Miscellaneous,                               15,189,000\r\n                                              -----------\r\n                                              166,073,000\r\n\r\nbesides other articles exceeding one hundred millions in value.\r\n\r\nRather than send abroad thirty or forty millions in gold annually, as we\r\nhave done of late years, let us dispense with foreign woollen goods,\r\nsilk and cotton goods, laces, &c., and encourage our own mills, at least\r\nuntil the war and its debt are over.\r\n\r\nMr. Madison said much in a few words, when he said:\r\n\r\n     'The theory of '_let us alone_' supposes that all nations concur in\r\n     a perfect freedom of commercial intercourse. Were this the case,\r\n     they would, in a commercial view, be but one nation, as much as the\r\n     several districts composing a particular nation; and the theory\r\n     would be as applicable to the former as the latter. But this golden\r\n     age of free trade has not yet arrived, nor is there a single nation\r\n     that has set the example. No nation can, indeed, safely do so,\r\n     until a reciprocity, at least, be insured to it. * * A nation,\r\n     leaving its foreign trade, in all cases, to regulate itself, might\r\n     soon find it regulated by other nations into subserviency to a\r\n     foreign interest.'\r\n\r\nThere is much good sense, too, in the views promulgated by another\r\npresident, who said, in relation to our independence of other nations:\r\n\r\n     'The tariff bill before us, embraces the design of fostering,\r\n     protecting, and preserving within ourselves the means of national\r\n     defence and independence, _particularly in a state of war_. * *\r\n     *The experience of the late war (1812) taught us a lesson, and one\r\n     never to be forgotten. If our liberty and republican form of\r\n     government, procured for us by our Revolutionary fathers, are worth\r\n     the blood and treasure at which they were obtained, it surely is\r\n     our duty to protect and defend them. * * * What is the real\r\n     situation of the agriculturist? Where has the American farmer a\r\n     market for his surplus product? Except for cotton, he has neither a\r\n     foreign nor home market. Does not this clearly prove, when there is\r\n     no market either at home or abroad, that there is too much labor\r\n     employed in agriculture, and that the channels of labor should be\r\n     multiplied? Common sense points out the remedy. Draw from\r\n     agriculture the superabundant labor; employ it in mechanism and\r\n     manufactures; thereby creating a home-market for your\r\n     bread-stuffs, and distributing labor to the most profitable account\r\n     and benefits to the country. Take from agriculture in the United\r\n     States six hundred thousand men, women and children, and you will\r\n     at once give a home-market for more bread-stuffs than all Europe\r\n     now furnishes us. In short, sir, _we have been too long subject to\r\n     the policy of British merchants_. It is time that we should become\r\n     a little more Americanized; and, instead of feeding the paupers and\r\n     laborers of England, feed our own; or else, in a short time, by\r\n     continuing our present policy, we shall be rendered paupers\r\n     ourselves.'\r\n\r\nMr. Bigelow, in his late and highly valuable work on the tariff, says\r\ntruly (p. 103):\r\n\r\n     'Can any one question that our home production far outweighs in\r\n     importance all other material interests of the nation? * * * It is\r\n     the nation of great internal resources, of vigorous productive\r\n     power and self-dependent strength, which is always best prepared\r\n     and most able, not only to defend itself, but to lend others a\r\n     helping hand.'\r\n\r\nIf our people would maintain their own national integrity, their own\r\nindividual independence, and their true status in the great family of\r\nnations of the earth, they will [at least until the present rebellion is\r\ncrushed, and until the public debt thereby created shall be\r\nextinguished] pursue a strict course of public and private economy. Let\r\nus encourage and support our own manufactures, and thereby contribute to\r\nthe subsistence and wealth of our own laborers instead of contributing\r\nmillions annually to the pauper labor of European nations; especially of\r\nthose nations that have failed to give us countenance in the present\r\nstruggle and that have, on the contrary, given both direct and indirect\r\naid to the rebels of the South.\r\n\r\nThe United States have within themselves, in great abundance,\r\ncontributed by a bountiful Providence, the leading products of the\r\nearth. In metals and in agricultural products, we exceed any and all\r\nother countries of the earth. If we encourage the labor of our own\r\npeople in the development of the great resources of the country, we\r\nshall not only preserve our own commercial independence, but we shall\r\nsoon be, as we ought to be in view of such advantages, the creditor\r\nnation of the world, and compel other countries to resort to us for the\r\nraw materials for their own manufacturing districts.\r\n\r\nWith the aid of the vast iron and coal mines of our own country, we can\r\nconstruct and keep in force an adequate navy for peace or for war. Our\r\nskilled industry can produce firearms equal to any in the world. The\r\nvast agricultural resources of the West yield abundance for ourselves\r\nand a large surplus for other countries. The breadstuffs of the West and\r\nNorthwest; the tobacco of the Middle States, and the cotton of the South\r\nare in demand, throughout nearly all Europe. Let us then be independent\r\nourselves of foreign manufacturers, and endeavor to place the rest of\r\nthe world under obligations to our own country for the necessaries of\r\nlife. This will do more to preserve peace than all the arguments of\r\ncabinets or the combined navies and armies of the world.\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston and Lord John Russell said,[7] in parliament, in 1842,\r\nfive years before the famine in Ireland: 'We are not, we cannot be,\r\nindependent of foreign nations, any more than they can of us: * * * two\r\nmillions of our people have been dependent on foreign countries for\r\ntheir daily food. At least five millions of our people are dependent on\r\nthe supplies of cotton from America, of foreign wool or foreign silk. *\r\n* * The true independence of a great commercial nation is to be found,\r\nnot in raising all the produce it requires within its own bound, _but in\r\nattaining such a preëminence in commerce that the time can never arise\r\nwhen other nations will not be compelled, for their own sales, to\r\nminister to its wants_.'\r\n\r\nNow this principle, enunciated twenty years ago by men, who now hold the\r\nreins of the English Government, _is especially one for us to bear in\r\nmind_. While England, from her limited surface, can never be independent\r\nof other countries for the supply of food, we may say, and we can\r\ndemonstrate, that the United States can reach that preëminence to which\r\nthe great English statesman alluded--a preëminence which he would gladly\r\nattain for his own countrymen.\r\n\r\nTo the General Government was confided by the framers of the\r\nConstitution the power to 'coin money, and regulate the value thereof;'\r\nand the States were forbidden to 'emit bills of credit;' from which we\r\nmay infer that it was intended to place the control of the currency in\r\nthe hands of the General Government. It will be generally conceded that\r\nit would be wiser to have one central point of issue than several\r\nhundred as at present. There should be but one form for, and one source\r\nof, the currency. It should emanate from a source where the power cannot\r\nbe abused, and where the interests of the people at large, and not of\r\nindividuals, will be consulted.\r\n\r\nThe people have thus an interest at stake. It is for their benefit that\r\na national circulation, of a perfectly reliable character, should be\r\nestablished. The remark made by Sir Robert Peel, in parliament, in May,\r\n1844, at the time of the recharter of the bank, applies with equal force\r\nto the national currency of this or any other country.\r\n\r\n     'There is no contract, public or private, national or individual,\r\n     which is unaffected by it. The enterprises of trade--the\r\n     arrangements made in all the domestic relations of society--the\r\n     wages of labor--pecuniary transactions of the highest amount and\r\n     the lowest--the payment of the national debt--the provision for the\r\n     national expenditure--the command which the coin of the lowest\r\n     denomination has over the necessaries of life--are all affected by\r\n     the decision to which we may come.'\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel wisely comprehended the powers and attributes of a\r\nnational currency, and we may wisely adopt his idea that such a national\r\ncurrency, controlled by the national legislature, for the use and\r\nbenefit of the people, is the only one that can be safely adopted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe national banking system established by Congress, in the year 1863,\r\nat the suggestion of Secretary Chase, of the Treasury Department, is the\r\ninitiatory step toward a highly desirable reform in the paper currency\r\nof the country. Already over seventy national banks have been organized,\r\nunder the act of Congress, with a combined capital of ten millions of\r\ndollars, whose circulation will have not only a uniform appearance, but\r\na uniform value throughout the whole country. Numerous others are in\r\nprocess of organization. To the community at large the new system is\r\ndesirable, because it secures to the people a currency of uniform value\r\nand perfect reliability. The notes of these institutions will be at par\r\nin every State in the Union, and holders may rely upon the certainty of\r\nredemption upon demand: whether the institution be solvent or not--in\r\nexistence or not--the Government holds adequate security for instant\r\nredemption of all notes issued under the law.\r\n\r\nThis feature of the paper currency of the country is one that has long\r\nbeen needed. For the want of it the States have been for many years\r\ncrowded with a currency of unequal market value, and of doubtful\r\nsecurity. Added to this is a marked feature of the new system which did\r\nnot pertain to the Bank of the United States in its best days. Its\r\nworkings are free from individual favoritism. No loans are granted to\r\npolitical or personal friends, at the risk of the Government, and all\r\ntemptation to needless and hurtful expansion is thus destroyed. There is\r\nno mammoth institution, under the control of one or a few individuals,\r\nliable at times to be prostituted to political and personal ends of an\r\nobjectionable character. While the banks under the new system are spread\r\nover a large space, they perform what is needed of the best managed\r\ninstitutions; and although perfectly independent of each other in their\r\nliabilities, expenses, losses, and in their action generally, yet\r\ntogether they form a practical unit, and will be serviceable in\r\ncounteracting that tendency to inflation and speculation which has\r\nmarked many years in the commercial history of this country.\r\n\r\nWe consider the Bank Act of 1863 as one of the most important features\r\nof the Thirty-seventh Congress, and of this Administration. It will\r\ncreate a link long wanted between the States and Territories, and do\r\nmuch to strengthen the Union and maintain commercial prosperity. The\r\ncountry will hereafter honor Secretary Chase for the conception and\r\nsuccess of this scheme, even if there were no other distinguished traits\r\nin his administration of the Treasury and the Government finances.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: 'The scenes exhibited far exceeded in horror _anything yet\r\nrecorded in European history_.'

We were mounted on the small horses of the country, whose first\r\nappearance excited some doubts in the mind of a friend whether he was to\r\ncarry the horse or the horse him. However, they are not quite ponies,\r\nand their blood is more noble than their size, being a good deal of it\r\nArab. They are decidedly preferable for mountain travel to larger\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nWe directed our course over the hot plains towards the mountains which\r\nrose invitingly before us, ready to receive us into their green depths.\r\nOn leaving the town, we passed first through sandy lanes bordered by\r\ncactus hedges, rising in columnar rows, and then came out upon the\r\nexcellent macadamized road over which thirteen of the sixteen miles of\r\nour journey lay. As we went along we met a continual succession of\r\ngroups of the country people, mostly women and children, coming into\r\nKingston with their weekly load of provisions to sell. They eyed us with\r\nexpressions varying from good-natured cordiality to sullenness, and\r\noccasionally we heard a rude remark at the expense of the 'Buckras;' but\r\nfor the most part their demeanor was civil and pleasant. Most of them\r\nhad the headloads without which a negro woman seems hardly complete in\r\nthe road, varying in dimensions from a huge basket of yams or bananas to\r\nan ounce vial. How such a slight thing manages to keep its perpendicular\r\nwith their careless, swinging gait, is something marvellous, but they\r\nmanage it to perfection. Almost every group, in addition, had a\r\nwell-laden donkey--comical little creatures, looking hardly bigger under\r\ntheir huge hampers than well-sized Newfoundland dogs, and hurrying\r\nnimbly along, with a speed that betokened a wholesome remembrance of a\r\ngood many hard thrashings in the past and a reasonable dread of similar\r\nones in the future. If I held the doctrine of transmigration, I should\r\nbe firmly persuaded that the souls of parish beadles, drunken captains,\r\nand other petty tyrants, shifted quarters into the bodies of Jamaica\r\nnegroes' donkeys. One patriotic black woman, whose donkey was rather\r\nrefractory, relieved her mind by exclaiming, in a tone of infinite\r\ndisgust, 'O-h-h you Roo-shan!' accompanying her objurgation by several\r\nemphatic demonstrations on his hide of how she was disposed to treat a\r\n'Rooshan' at that present moment.[8]\r\n\r\nGoing on, we passed several beautiful 'pens,' as farms devoted to\r\ngrazing are called. These near town are little more than mere pieces of\r\nland surrounding elegant villas, the residence of wealthy gentlemen\r\nwhose business lies in Kingston. Here you see 'the one-storied house of\r\nthe tropics, with its green jalousies and deep veranda,' surrounded by\r\nhandsomely kept meadows of the succulent Guinea grass, which clothes so\r\nlarge a part of the island with its golden green, and enclosed by wire\r\nfences or by the intricate but delicate logwood hedges, or else by stone\r\nwalls. On either side of the carriage road which swept round before the\r\nmost elegant of these villas, that of Mr. Porteous, we noticed rows of\r\nthe mystic century plant.\r\n\r\nAt last we left the comparatively arid plain, with its scantier\r\nvegetation, and began to ascend Stony Hill, which is 1,360 feet high\r\nwhere the road passes over it. The cool air passing through the gap, and\r\nour increasing elevation, now began to temper the heat, and soon the\r\nclouds began to gather again, and a slight rain fell. But I did not\r\nnotice it, for every step of the journey now seemed to bring me farther\r\ninto the heart of fairyland. It was not any variety of colors, but the\r\nunutterable depth of green, enclosing us, as we ascended, more and more\r\ncompletely in its boundless exuberance. From that moment the richest\r\nverdure of my native country has seemed pale and poor. Reaching the top\r\nof the hill, we saw above us the higher range, looking down on us\r\nthrough the shifting mists, with that inexpressible gracefulness which\r\ntempers the grandeur of tropical mountains.\r\n\r\nWe descended the hill on the other side into a small inland valley,\r\ncontaining the two estates of Golden Spring and Temple Hall. The\r\nformer, which presented nothing very noticeable then, has since passed\r\nunder the management of a gentleman who to a judicious and energetic\r\npersonal oversight has added a kindliness and strict honesty in his\r\ndealings with the laborers much more desirable than frequent in the\r\nisland. As a result of this, Golden Spring has become a garden. A great\r\nmany more dilapidated estates would become gardens under the same\r\nefficacious mode of treatment.\r\n\r\nThe streams were so swollen by the rain that on coming to what is\r\ncommonly a trifling rivulet, we found it so high as to cost us some\r\ntrouble to cross. However, we all got over, although one servant boy\r\nwith his pack horse was caught by the current and carried down several\r\nrods almost into the river, which was rushing by in a turbid torrent. I\r\nought to have been much alarmed, but having a happy way, in new\r\ncircumstances, of taking it for granted that everything which happens is\r\njust what ought to happen then and there, I stood composedly on the\r\nfarther bank, nothing doubting that the boy and the beast had their own\r\ngood reasons for striking out a new track, and it was not till they were\r\nboth safe on land that I learned with some consternation that they had\r\ncome within an inch of being drowned.\r\n\r\nAt length we turned aside into a byroad leading up a steep hill,\r\nslippery with mud, and left this pleasant valley. I passed through it\r\nmany a time afterwards, and never lost the impression of its peaceful\r\nrichness.\r\n\r\nWe now found ourselves in the wild country in which our missionary\r\nstations lie. Hills rose around on every side; their surfaces broken and\r\nfurrowed into every fantastic variety of shape, with only distance\r\nenough between their bases for the mountain streams to flow. In our\r\nlatitude such a country would be much of the time a bleak desolation.\r\nBut here the mantle of glorious and everlasting green softens and\r\nenriches the broken and fluctuating surfaces into luxuriant and cloying\r\nbeauty. In such an ocean of verdure we now found ourselves, its emerald\r\nwaves rolling above, below, and around us. Our road, when once we had\r\nsurmounted the short hill, was a narrow, winding bridle path, which kept\r\nalong almost upon a level over a continual succession of natural\r\ncauseways, spanning the gullies with such an appearance of art as I have\r\nnever seen elsewhere. I afterward learned that these are dikes of trap,\r\nfrom which the softer rock has been gradually disintegrated, leaving\r\nthem thus happily arranged for human convenience.\r\n\r\nAfter three miles' travel over these roads of nature's making, in a rain\r\nwhich at last became quite uncomfortable, we came finally to Oberlin\r\nMission House. A West Indian country house, without fire or carpets,\r\nmust be very pleasingly fitted up not to look dreary in a wet day, and\r\nOberlin House appeared rather cheerless as we alighted with streaming\r\ngarments, the romance pretty well soaked out of us for the time. But\r\nafter supper and a change of clothes, and the clearing away of the\r\nclouds, our dismal spirits cleared up too, and we went out into the\r\ngarden to enjoy the rare flowers and plants--the crimson-leaved\r\nponsetto, the Bleeding Heart, with its ensanguined centre, the curiously\r\npied and twisted Croton Pictum, the Plumbago, well named from the leaden\r\nhue of its flowers, the long, deep-red leaves of the Dragon's Blood, the\r\npurple magnificence of the Passion flower, relieved by the more familiar\r\nbeauty of the Four o'clock and of the Martinique rose. Seeing something\r\nthat pleased me, I stepped forward to view it more narrowly, when a\r\nsudden access of acute pain in one foot, quickly spreading to the knee,\r\nadmonished me that I had got into mischief in the shape of an ant's\r\nnest, and gave me the first instalment of a lesson I learned in due time\r\nvery thoroughly, that the beauties of Jamaica are to be enjoyed with a\r\nvery cautious regard to the paramount rights of the insect creation.\r\n\r\nWhen I went to bed, I found the bedclothes saturated with dampness. But\r\nI learned that it was like a Newport fog, too saline to be mischievous.\r\nThe atmosphere of the island, even in the brightest and most elastic\r\nweather, is so impregnated with moisture, that a Leyden jar will lose\r\nits charge in being taken across the room, and an electrical machine\r\nwill not work without a pan of coals under the cylinder. But as no part\r\nof the island is more than twenty-five miles from the sea, this\r\ncontinual moisture appears to be quite innocuous, its worst effect being\r\nthe musty smell which it causes in everything in the mountains, where\r\nthere is the most rain. Use fortunately takes from us the perception of\r\nthis, or it would be quite intolerable. Perpetual summer, and the utmost\r\nglory of earth, sky, and sea, are not to be enjoyed without drawbacks\r\nthat would make a careful housekeeper very doubtful about the\r\ndesirableness of the exchange. And so ended my first day in the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF THE ISLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nI had intended writing some of my first impressions about Jamaica,\r\nparticularly its negro population. But I find, on reviewing my residence\r\nof five years and a half in the tranquil island, that first impressions\r\nmelt so imperceptibly into final conclusions, that it appears best not\r\nto attempt a too formal separation of them. Before recounting the\r\nresults of my own experience, however, in any form, it will not be amiss\r\nto attempt some general description of the island and of its population,\r\nand to give a slight sketch of its history.\r\n\r\nThe parallel of 18° N lat. passes through the island of Jamaica, which\r\nhas thus a true tropical climate. It is 160 miles in length and 40 in\r\naverage breadth, having thus a plane area of 6,400 square miles, being\r\nabout equal to the united area of Connecticut and Rhode Island. Although\r\nthe third in size of the Greater Antilles, it comes at a great remove\r\nafter Hayti, the second, being not more than one-fourth as large. Nor\r\ndoes it compare in fertility with either Hayti or Cuba. The former\r\nisland is the centre of geological upheaval, and the great rounded\r\nmasses, sustaining a soil of inexhaustible depth, run off from thence\r\nsplintering into sharp ridges, which in Jamaica become veritable knife\r\nedges, sustaining a soil comparatively thin. The character of the island\r\nis that of a mountain mass, which, as the ancient watermark on the\r\nnorthern coast shows, has at some remote period been tilted over, and\r\nhas shot out an immense amount of detritus on its southern side, forming\r\nthus the plains which extend along a good part of that coast, varying in\r\nbreadth from ten to twenty miles, besides the alluvial peninsula of\r\nVere. In the interior, also, there is an upland basin of considerable\r\nextent, looking like the dry bed of a former lake, which now forms the\r\nchief part of the parish of St. Thomas-in-the-Vale. The mountain mass\r\nwhich makes the body of the island, running in various ranges through\r\nits whole length, culminates in the eastern part of it in the Blue\r\nMountains, whose principal summit, the Blue Mountain Peak, is 7,500 feet\r\nhigh. It is said that Columbus, wishing to give Queen Isabella an\r\nimpression of the appearance of these, took a sheet of tissue paper, and\r\ncrumpling it up in his hand, threw it on a table, exclaiming, 'There!\r\nsuch is their appearance.' The device used by the great discoverer to\r\nconvey to the mind of the royal Mother of America some image of her\r\nnew-found realms, forcibly recurs to the mind of the traveller as he\r\nsails along the southeastern coast, and notices the strange contortions\r\nof the mountain surfaces. But seen from the northern shore, at a greater\r\ndistance, through the purple haze which envelops them, their outlines\r\nleave a different impression. I shall always remember their aspect of\r\ngraceful sublimity, as seen from Golden Vale, in Portland, and of\r\nmassive sweetness, as seen from Hermitage House, in the parish of St.\r\nGeorge. The gray buttresses of their farthest western peak, itself over\r\n5,000 feet in height, rose in full view of a station where I long\r\nresided, and the region covered by their lower spurs, ranging in\r\nelevation from seven to ten and twelve hundred feet, is that which\r\nespecially deserves the name of the 'well-watered land,' or, as it is\r\npoetically rendered, the 'isle of springs,' of which Jamaica, or perhaps\r\nmore exactly Xaymaca, is the Indian equivalent. There you meet in most\r\nabundance with those crystal rivulets, every few hundred yards threading\r\nthe road, and going to swell the wider streams which every mile or two\r\ncross the traveller's way, laving his horse's sides with refreshing\r\ncoolness, as they hurry on in their tortuous course from the mountain\r\nheights to the sea. Farther west the mountains and hills assume gentler\r\nand more rounded forms, particularly in the parish of St. Anne, the\r\nGarden of Jamaica. I regret that I know only by report the scenes of\r\nEden-like loveliness of this delightful parish. It is principally\r\ndevoted to grazing, and its pastures are maintained in a park-like\r\nperfection. Grassy eminences, crowned with woods, and covered with herds\r\nof horses and the handsome Jamaica cattle, descend, in successive\r\nundulations, to the sea. Over these, from the deck of a vessel a few\r\nmiles out, may be seen falling the silver threads of many cascades.\r\nExcellent roads traverse the parish, which is inhabited by a gentry in\r\neasy circumstances, and by a contented and thriving yeomanry. St. Anne\r\nappears to be truly a Christian Arcadia.\r\n\r\nIn respect of climate and vegetation, there are three Jamaicas--Jamaica\r\nof the plains, Jamaica of the uplands, and Jamaica of the high\r\nmountains. The highest summit of the mountain region, is below the line\r\nat which snow is ever formed in this latitude, and it is disputed\r\nwhether an evanescent hoarfrost even is sometimes seen upon it. As high\r\nas four and five thousand feet there are residences, which, however,\r\npurchase freedom from the lowland heats at the expense of being a large\r\npart of the time enveloped in chilling fogs. Here the properly tropical\r\nproductions cease to thrive, and melancholy caricatures of northern\r\nvegetables and fruits take their place. You see in the Kingston market\r\ndiminutive and watery potatoes and apples, that have come down from the\r\nclouds, and on St. Catherine's Peak I once picked a few strawberries,\r\nwhich had about as much savor as so many chips. The noble forest trees\r\nof the lower mountains, as you go up, give way to an exuberant but\r\nspongy growth of tree-ferns and bushes. Great herds of wild swine,\r\ndescended from those introduced by the Spaniards, roam these secluded\r\nthickets, and once furnished subsistence to the runaway negroes who,\r\nunder the name of Maroons, for several generations annoyed and terrified\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\nIn these high mountains the sense of deep solitude is at once heightened\r\nand softened by the flute-like notes of the solitaire. I shall never\r\nforget the impression produced by first hearing this. It was on the top\r\nof St. Catherine's Peak, fifty-two hundred feet above the sea, in the\r\nearly morning, when the mountain solitude seemed most profound, that my\r\ncompanion and I heard from the adjacent woods its mysterious note. It\r\nwas a soft and clear tone, somewhat prolonged, and ending in a\r\nmodulation which imparted to it an indescribable effect, as if of\r\nsupernal melancholy. It seemed almost as if some mild angel were\r\nlingering pensively upon the mountain tops, before pursuing his downward\r\nflight among the unhappy sons of men.\r\n\r\nThe uplands of the island, from 800 to 1,500 feet above the sea, are a\r\ncheerful, sunny region, in which the tropical heat is tempered by\r\nalmost constant refreshing breezes, and, in the eastern part at least,\r\nby abundant showers. Some of the western parishes not unfrequently\r\nsuffer terribly from drought. There are two or three which have not even\r\na spring, depending wholly upon rain water collected in tanks. These\r\nsometimes become dry, causing unutterable distress both to man and\r\nbeast. We hear even sometimes of poor people starving during these\r\nseasons of drought. But our more favored region in the east scarcely\r\nknows dearth. Our mighty mountain neighbors seldom permitted us even to\r\nfear it, and were more apt to send us a deluge than a drought.\r\n\r\nIn the uplands our winter temperature was commonly about 75° in the\r\nshade at noon, and the summer temperature about ten degrees higher. The\r\nnights are almost always agreeably cool, and frequent showers and\r\nbreezes allay the sultriness of the days. I never saw the thermometer\r\nabove 90° in the shade, and seldom below 65°. It once fell to 54°, to\r\nthe lamentable discomfort of our feelings and fingers. Of course, where\r\nthe sun for months is nearly vertical, and twice in the summer actually\r\nso, the heat of his direct beams is intense. But those careful\r\nprecautions of avoiding travelling in the middle of the day, on which\r\nsome lay such stress, we never concerned ourselves with in Jamaica, and\r\nI could not discover that we were ever the worse for it. An umbrella was\r\nenough to stand between us and mischief.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, it may safely be said that there is no climate more like\r\nthat which we imagine of Eden than that of the highland region of\r\nJamaica during a large part of the year. It is true that after a while\r\nnorthern constitutions begin to miss the stimulus of occasional cold.\r\nBut for a few years nothing could be more delightful. The chief drawback\r\nis that at uncertain cycles there come incessant deluges of rain for\r\nmonths together, making it dreary and uncomfortable both in doors and\r\nout. Years will sometimes pass before there is any excessive amount of\r\nthese, and then sometimes for years together they will prevail to a most\r\ndisagreeable extent. They break up the mountain roads and swell the\r\nmountain streams to such a degree as to render travelling almost\r\nimpossible, and in a country where your friends are few, you do not like\r\nto be kept back from seeing them by the imminent risk of finding no road\r\nat all on the side of a hill where at best there is barely room enough\r\nbetween the bank and the gully for one horse to pass another, or of\r\nfinding yourself between two turns of a stream, with a sudden shower\r\nmaking it impossible for you to get either forward or back. But during\r\nmy residence I had just enough of these adventures to give a pleasant\r\nzest to life. And after a tremendous rain of hours, when the sun\r\nreappeared, and the banks of fleecy cloud were once more seen floating\r\ntranquilly in heaven, and the streams ran again crystal clear, and the\r\nhills smiled again in all the glory of their brilliant green, and the\r\nair had again its wonted temper, at once balmy and elastic, it was\r\nenough to make amends for all previous discomfort.\r\n\r\nAlthough no part of the island is peculiarly favorable to constitutions\r\nof the European race, yet with prudence and temperance foreigners find\r\nthis midland region reasonably healthy. The missionaries, who have\r\nmostly resided in the uplands, have but seldom fallen victims to fevers.\r\nForeigners must not expect to live here without occasional attacks of\r\nfever; but with care, there need be little apprehension of a fatal\r\nresult, except to those of a sanguine temperament or of a corpulent\r\nhabit. And the general exemption from the dreadful ravages of\r\nconsumption may well be thought to compensate the somewhat greater risks\r\nfrom fever. Even on the plains, that immense mortality of whites from\r\nthe mother country which once gave to Jamaica the ominous name of 'The\r\nGrave of Europeans,' was caused as much by their reckless intemperance\r\nas by any necessity of the climate. Or, rather, habits which in Great\r\nBritain might have been indulged in with comparative impunity, in\r\nJamaica were rapidly fatal. It is said that another cause of the\r\nexcessive mortality among the overseers was that they were often\r\nsecretly poisoned by the blacks. On some plantations, I have heard it\r\nsaid, overseer after overseer was poisoned off, almost as soon as he\r\narrived. In most cases, I dare say, it would be found that over-liberal\r\npotations of Jamaica rum were the poison that did the mischief. But the\r\nreports have probably some foundation in truth. An oppressed race,\r\nseldom daring to strike openly, would be very apt to devise subtle ways\r\nof vengeance. It will be remembered that one of the most frequent items\r\nin our own Southern newspapers used to be accounts of attempts made by\r\nslave girls to poison their masters' families. Arsenic, which they\r\ncommonly used, is a clumsy means, almost sure to be detected; but in the\r\nWest Indies, where the proportion of native Africans was always very\r\nlarge, the African sorcerers, the dreaded Obi-men, who exercise so\r\nbaleful a power over the imaginations of the blacks, appear also to have\r\navailed themselves of other than imaginary charms to keep up their\r\ncredit as the disposers of life and death, and to have often gained such\r\na knowledge of slow vegetable poisons as made them formidable helpers of\r\nrevenge, whether against their own race or against the race of their\r\noppressors. In a recent Jamaica story of Captain Mayne Reid's, the plot\r\ncentres in the hideous figure of an old Obi-man, who wreaks his revenge\r\nfor former wrongs in this secret way, destroying victim after victim\r\nfrom among the lords of the soil. The piece is stocked with horrors\r\nenough for the most ravenous devourer of yellow-covered literature, but\r\nnevertheless it is so true to the conditions of life in the old days of\r\nJamaica, that it is well worth reading for a lively sense of the time\r\nwhen the fearful influences of savage heathenism, slavery, and tropical\r\npassion were working together in that land of rarest beauty and of\r\nfoulest sin. Evil enough remains, but, thank God, the hideous shadows of\r\nthe past have fled away forever.\r\n\r\nBut these tragical remembrances and suspicions belong rather to the\r\nplains, into which we are about to descend. Here we feel distinctly that\r\nwe are in the tropics. The sweltering heat, tempered, indeed, by the\r\nland and sea breezes, but still sufficiently oppressive, and almost the\r\nsame day and night, leaves no doubt of this fact. Vegetation, too,\r\nappears more distinctly tropical. The character of the landscape in the\r\ntwo regions is quite different. In the uplands the wealth of glowing\r\ngreen swallows up peculiarities of form, and presents little difference\r\nof color except the endless diversity of its own shades. There are,\r\nhowever, some distinct features of the landscape. Conspicuous on every\r\nhillside are the groves 'where the mango apples grow,' their mass of\r\ndense rounded foliage looking not unlike our maples, and giving a\r\npleasant sense of home to the northern sojourner. The feathery bamboo,\r\nmost gigantic of grasses, runs in plumy lines across the country. Around\r\nthe negro cottages, here and there, rise groups of the cocoanut palms,\r\ngiving, more than anything else, a tropical character to the landscape.\r\nOn a distant eminence may perhaps be seen a lofty ceiba or cotton tree,\r\nits white trunk rising sixty or seventy feet from the ground without a\r\nlimb, and then putting out huge, scraggy arms, loaded with parasites.\r\nEvery lesser feature is swamped in verdure, except that here and there\r\nthe whitewashed walls of a negro cottage of the better sort gleam\r\npleasantly forth from embowering hedges and fruit trees. I do not know\r\nhow Wordsworth's advice to make country houses as much as possible of\r\nthe color of the surrounding country may apply among the gray hills of\r\nWestmoreland; but among the green hills of Jamaica, the white which he\r\ndeprecates forms a welcome relief to the splendid monotony of glowing\r\nemerald. It is not amiss to call it emerald, for there are so many\r\nplants here with glossy leaves, that under the brilliant sunlight the\r\nlustre of the green is almost more than the eye can bear. To the\r\nsouthward of Oberlin station, formerly belonging to our mission, rises a\r\nrange of verdant hills, which in some lights has so much the pure,\r\ncontinuous color of a gem, as almost to realize Arabian fables to the\r\neye. Indeed, I have gazed at it sometimes with such a feeling as Aladdin\r\nhad when the magician had left him confined in the Hall of Jewels, and\r\nhave almost wished for an earthquake to cleave its oppressive superbness\r\nand give a refreshing sight of the blue sea beyond.\r\n\r\nBut on descending to the plains, where there is less moisture, and where\r\nvegetation therefore is scantier, we find the unwonted forms of growth\r\nmore distinct, and have the full sense of being in a southern land. Here\r\nthe thorn palms, the cactus hedges, the penguin fences, resembling huge\r\npineapple plants, and various trees and shrubs, being seen more\r\nisolated, make a stronger impression of the peculiarities of tropical\r\nforms. Here too we meet in greater abundance with the cocoanut tree,\r\noccasionally forming long avenues of lofty palms on the estates. And\r\nhere we see more frequently the huge squares of many acres, heavy with\r\nthe luxuriant wealth of the cane, and thronged by dusky laborers. The\r\nheat, which in the uplands is pleasant, though rather too steady in the\r\nplains, becomes oppressive and enervating. The distinction between the\r\nwet and dry seasons, also, is much more distinctly marked, and, in\r\nshort, everything corresponds more fully with the usual idea of a\r\ntropical land.\r\n\r\nThe luxuriance and the glory of nature are the same now as ever; but\r\neverywhere over the island the traveller sees the melancholy evidences\r\nof the decay of former wealth. You may travel over miles and miles on\r\nthe plains once rich with the cane, or ridge after ridge in the uplands\r\nonce covered with the dark-green coffee plantations, which now are\r\nalmost a wilderness. To quote the language of another, 'ridges,\r\novergrown with guava bushes, mark the cornfields; rank vegetation fills\r\nthe courtyard, and even bursts through the once hospitable roof. A curse\r\nseems to have fallen upon the land, as if this generation were atoning\r\nfor the sins of the past. For while we lament the ruin of the present\r\nproprietors, we cannot forget the unrequited toil which in times gone by\r\ncreated the wealth they have lost; nor that hapless race, the original\r\nowners of the soil, whose fate darkens the saddest page in history.'\r\n\r\nA passing traveller will see little to compensate the sadness occasioned\r\nby old magnificence thus in ruins, strewing the whole island with its\r\nmelancholy wrecks. What there is to set off against it, we shall\r\nconsider hereafter.\r\n\r\nWhat survives of the agriculture and commerce of Jamaica is still, as\r\nformerly, mainly dependent on the two great staples, sugar and coffee;\r\nthe former being raised chiefly in the plains and valleys, the latter in\r\nthe uplands and mountains. There was, it is said, an indigenous sugar\r\ncane in the West Indies, when first discovered; but if so, it has long\r\nbeen supplanted by the Mauritius cane, which is now cultivated. The\r\njoints of the cane, being cut and laid horizontally in furrows, which\r\nare then covered over, spring up in a crop which comes to maturity in\r\nabout a year; and when this is cut, the roots rattoon, or send up shoots\r\nfor five or six years in succession. This is one reason why Jamaica\r\nsugar planters find it so hard to compete with Cuban production. On the\r\ndeep soil of Cuba the cane rattoons, it is said, not five or six, but\r\nforty years in succession.\r\n\r\nThe coffee plant is a beautiful shrub. Left to itself, it would grow\r\ntwenty or thirty feet high; but it is kept down to such a height as that\r\nthe berries can easily be picked by the hand. Its glossy, dark-green\r\nleaves resemble a good deal the jessamine; and the resemblance is\r\nincreased during the time of flowering, by the beautiful white blossoms,\r\nof a faint, delicate fragrance, which are scattered over the branches\r\nlike a light powdering of snow. It thrives well in a moist air; and\r\ncoffee plantations may be seen clothing the sides of mountains three,\r\nfour, and even five thousand feet above the sea. The history of the way\r\nin which coffee was introduced to the West Indies is really quite a\r\nlittle romance, though an authentic one. It is well known that Holland\r\nused to practise the most odious commercial monopoly ever known among\r\nChristian nations. Her spice islands were guarded with a cruel jealousy\r\nrivalling the fables of the dragon that guarded the golden apples; and\r\nher great coffee island, Java, was equally locked up from the world. To\r\ngive a spice plant or a coffee plant to a stranger, was an offence\r\ninexorably punished with death. A single coffee plant, however, was\r\nallowed to come to Europe as an ornament to the conservatory of a\r\nwealthy Amsterdam burgomaster. This was still more jealously watched\r\nthan its fellows in the East Indies; but at length a French visitor\r\nmanaged to secrete a living berry, and, taking it with him to Paris, to\r\nraise a plant. From this again a young plant was taken to Martinique,\r\none of the French West Indies. When the young stranger, freighted with\r\nsuch possibilities of wealth, arrived there, it was found that the\r\nexposure of the voyage had nearly extinguished its vitality. It was\r\ntended with the most anxious care; but for two or three years it\r\ncontinued to languish, and threatened by an untimely death to give Dutch\r\nselfishness a triumph after all. At last, however, it took a happy\r\nstart, and from that plant the whole West Indies have derived their\r\ncoffee. It was introduced into Jamaica in 1720, and Temple Hall, one of\r\nthe two estates which I have mentioned as being in the beautiful valley\r\nbetween Kingston and the American Mission, has the honor of showing the\r\noldest coffee walk in the island.\r\n\r\nJamaica coffee is of an excellent quality; the berries, it is said, if\r\nkept two years, being equal to the best Mocha. As some one laments that\r\nthe cooks and grooms of the Romans spoke better Latin than even Milton\r\namong the moderns could write, so I can boast in behalf of the Jamaica\r\nnegroes, that even Delmonico, unless he could secure the services of one\r\nof them who understands the true method of reducing the browned berry to\r\nan impalpable powder, by pulverizing it between a flat stone and a round\r\none, must give up all hopes of presenting his guests with the ideal cup\r\nof coffee. I would give the whole process by which an amber-colored\r\nstream, of perfect flavor, might be poured out, without a trace of\r\nsediment, to the very last drop, did I not reflect with pity that\r\nprobably in all the wide extent of my country there is neither the\r\napparatus of grinding nor the sable domestic with skill to use it. Nay,\r\neven in Jamaica, where one would think they could afford to be slow\r\n_for_ a good thing, since they are so amazingly slow _to_ every good\r\nthing, I grieve to say that the barbarous mill, hacking and mangling the\r\nfragrant berry, has almost universally supplanted the more laborious\r\nancient method by which it was gently reduced to its most perfect\r\nattrition, yielding up every particle of its aromatic strength. Thus the\r\nmodern demon of expedition, to whom quickness is so much more than\r\nquality, has invaded even the slumberous repose of our fair island,\r\nbringing under his arm, not a locomotive, but a coffee mill. There are,\r\nto be sure, two or three locomotives on the twelve-mile railway between\r\nKingston and Spanishtown, but it would be a cruel sarcasm to intimate\r\nthat the genius of expedition ever brought them.\r\n\r\nThere are several other vegetable products of Jamaica, which it owes\r\nlikewise to a happy accident. The mango, for instance, which now grows\r\nin such profusion on uplands and plains, that if the groves should be\r\ncut down, the face of the country would seem naked, was a spoil of war,\r\nbeing brought from a French ship destined for Martinique, somewhere\r\nabout 1790. At first it is said the mangoes sold for a guinea a piece,\r\nwith the express stipulation that the seed should be returned. Now, in a\r\ngood bearing season, I have actually seen a narrow mountain road fetlock\r\ndeep with decaying mangoes, besides the thousands consumed by man and\r\nbeast. During the summer, in the good years, they furnish the main\r\nsubsistence to the negro children, and a large part of the subsistence\r\nof the adults, and make a grateful and wholesome change from the yam and\r\nsalt fish which constitute the staples of their diet the rest of the\r\ntime. It is this, probably, which has given rise to the absurd report\r\nthat the negroes live principally on fruits spontaneously growing.\r\n\r\nThe young leaves of the mango are of a brownish red; and amid the\r\ngeneral profusion of green, they impart a not ungrateful relief to the\r\neye. Even their russet blossoms have a pleasant look. But in a good\r\nseason, when the fruit is ripe, the groves have a magnificently rich\r\nappearance. Rows upon rows of yellow fruit look like lines of golden\r\napples. Most people are extravagantly fond of them; but for myself I\r\nmust say that, excepting the superb 'No. 11'--so named from being thus\r\nnumbered on the captured French ship--and one or two other rare kinds, I\r\nconcur with the late Prof. Adams, of Amherst, in thinking that a very\r\ngood mango might be made by steeping raw cotton in turpentine, and\r\nsprinkling a little sugar over it.\r\n\r\nAnother fortuitous gift to Jamaica, so far as human intention is\r\nconcerned, was the invaluable donation of the Guinea grass. Toward a\r\ncentury ago some African birds were brought as a present to a gentleman\r\nin the west of the island. Some grass seeds had been brought along for\r\ntheir feed; and when they reached their journey's end, the seeds were\r\nthrown away. After a while it was noticed that the cattle were very\r\neager to reach the grass growing on a certain spot, and on examination\r\nit was found that the seeds thrown away had come up as a grass of\r\nremarkable succulence and nutritiousness. It was soon distributed, and\r\nnow it is spread over the island. You pass rich meadows of it on every\r\nlowland estate; and it clothes hundreds of hills to their tops with its\r\nyellowish green. I do not see what the island would do without it. The\r\npens or grazing farms in particular have been almost wholly created by\r\nit.\r\n\r\nJamaica has, of course, the usual West Indian fruits, the orange, the\r\nshaddock, the lime, the pineapple, the guava, the nispero, the banana,\r\nthe cocoanut, and many others not much known abroad. But the\r\nlusciousness of tropical fruits compares ill with the thousand delicate\r\nflavors which cultivation has extended through our temperate clime;\r\nwhile, at the same time, steam makes nearly all the best fruits of the\r\nWest Indies familiar to our markets. The resident of New York or\r\nPhiladelphia, and still more of Baltimore has small occasion to wish\r\nhimself in the tropics for the sake of fruit.\r\n\r\nThe great staple of negro existence, and therefore the great staple of\r\nexistence to the immense majority of the inhabitants, is the yam. There\r\nare some indigenous kinds; but the species most in use appear to have\r\nbeen brought in by the imported African slaves. This solid edible dwarfs\r\nour potatoes, a single root varying in weight from five to ten pounds,\r\nand sometimes even reaching the weight of fifty pounds. They are of all\r\nshapes, globular, finger shaped, and long; and the latter, with their\r\nthick, brown rinds, look more like billets of wood, crusted with earth,\r\nthan anything else. People in this country are apt to imagine them to be\r\na huge kind of sweet potato, with which they have no other connection\r\nthan that both are edible roots. The white yams, boiled and mashed, are\r\nscarcely distinguishable from very superior white potatoes. Above ground\r\nthe plant is a vine, requiring to be trained on a pole, and a yamfield\r\nlooks precisely like a vineyard. But oh, the difference! while the\r\nvineyard calls up a thousand recollections of laughing girls treading\r\nthe grape, and the sunny lands of story, a yamfield reminds you only\r\nthat under the ground is a bulky esculent, which some months hence will\r\nbe put into a negro pot, and boiled and eaten, with an utter absence of\r\npoetry, or of anything but appetite and salt. It is plain that in this\r\ncase solid usefulness stands no chance with erratic and rather\r\nloose-mannered brilliancy. And yet some kinds of yam in flower diffuse a\r\nfragrance more exquisite, I am persuaded, than comes from any vineyard.\r\nSo that, after all, their homely prose has some flavor of poetry, which,\r\nwhen African poets arise, will doubtless be duly canonized in song.\r\n\r\nAs yet the small freeholders have chiefly occupied themselves in raising\r\nthese 'ground provisions,' as yams, plantains, bananas, and the various\r\nvegetables are called. But they are more and more largely planting cane\r\nand coffee, greatly to their own advantage and that of the island.\r\n\r\nIf in this favored zone the earth is pleasant underneath, nothing can be\r\nmore glorious than the heavens above. Being under the parallel of 18° N.\r\nlat., of course we have a full view of all the northern heavens, and of\r\nall the southern heavens, except 18° about the South Pole. The rarefied\r\natmosphere gives peculiar brilliancy to the stars; and on a clear\r\nnight--and most nights are clear--the heavens are indeed flooded with\r\nwhite fire, while, according to the season of the year, Orion and his\r\nnorthern company appear with a lustre unwonted to us, or the Scorpion\r\nunfolds his sparkling length, or the Ship displays its glittering\r\nconfusion of stars, or the Southern Cross rears aloft its sacred symbol.\r\nMeanwhile, well down toward the northern horizon, the pole star holds\r\nits fixed position, and the Great and the Little Bear, dipping toward\r\nthe ocean wave, but not yet dipping in it, pursue their nightly\r\nrevolutions. Long after sunset, and long before sunrise, night after\r\nnight, the faint, nebulous gleam of the zodiacal lights stretches up\r\ntoward the zenith. The shortness of the twilight frequently leaves the\r\nfugacious planet, Mercury, so seldom seen at the north, in distinct\r\nview. While Venus not merely casts a shadow in a clear night, as she\r\ndoes with us, but when she is brightest, actually shines through the\r\nclouds with an illumining power.\r\n\r\nAlternating with these glories of the starry firmament, the moon at the\r\nfull fills the lower air with a soft, yet bright light, in which you can\r\nread without difficulty the smallest print. Under this milder\r\nillumination, the overpowering luxuriance of the landscape loses its\r\noppressiveness, the hills assume more rounded forms, and from the\r\ngeneral obscurity, the palms, a tree made for moonlight, stand out in\r\nsoft distinctness. At such a time we forget the foul crimes which\r\ndisfigure the past, and the vices which degrade the present of this fair\r\nland, and can easily imagine ourselves in the garden where the yet\r\nunfallen progenitors of mankind walked under a firmament 'glowing with\r\nliving sapphires,' and together hymned the praises of their Creator.\r\nDaylight chases away this illusion, but brings back the reality of\r\nChristian work, whose rugged but cheerful tasks replace the delicious\r\nbut ineffectual dreams of Paradise Lost, by the hope of contributing, in\r\nsome humble measure, toward restoring in a province of fallen earth the\r\nlineaments of Paradise Regained.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: This was during the Crimean war.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RESTORATION OF THE UNION.\r\n\r\n\r\nGod is on the side of our country. Let us reverently thank him that he\r\nhas favored the general march of our arms toward the sacred end of our\r\nexertions--the defeat of the daring attempt against the unity of our\r\nnational power and the integrity of our free institutions. Not always in\r\nhuman affairs has the cause of right and freedom prevailed. In the\r\ngradual development of human society, as unfolded in the lapse of long\r\nages, the oppressor has generally triumphed, and history has full often\r\nbeen compelled to record the failure of the noblest efforts, and the\r\ndownfall of the most righteous designs conceived for the benefit of man.\r\nSuch has been the experience of the race in those parts of the world\r\nwhich have longest been the theatre of human enterprise and of\r\nestablished government. But the American continent seems to present an\r\nexception to this uniformity of sinister events: it is destined to be\r\nthe seat of civil liberty. The success of our institutions in\r\nwithstanding the awful trial to which they have just been subjected,\r\nindicates the existence of providential designs toward our favored\r\ncountry, not to be thwarted by any mortal agency at home or abroad. Such\r\na combination of hostile elements, so powerful and determined, has never\r\nbefore assailed any political structure without overthrowing it. The\r\nfailure in the present instance shows that our great destiny will be\r\naccomplished in the face of all obstacles, however insurmountable they\r\nmay appear to be.\r\n\r\nProvidence always accomplishes its ends by appropriate\r\ninstrumentalities; and in our case there are natural causes adequate to\r\nthe great result which seems to be inevitable. In North America the\r\nprinciple of equal rights and of unobstructed individual progress has\r\nbecome the fundamental law of society. It is needless to trace the\r\norigin and growth of this principle; but its operation has been so\r\npowerful and productive, so fully imbued with moral and intellectual\r\npower, so solid and safe as a basis of national organization, as shown\r\nin the marvellous history of the United States, that no uncongenial\r\nprinciple is capable of resisting it, or even of maintaining an\r\nexistence by its side. This is true not only with regard to that\r\nantagonistic principle which is now desperately but hopelessly waging a\r\nsuicidal war within the bosom of the great republic; but it is equally\r\ntrue with regard to that insidious germ of despotism, which threatens to\r\npush its way through the soil of a neighboring country, displacing the\r\nfree institutions which have long and sadly languished amid the civil\r\nwars of a most unhappy people. The same vigorous vitality which will\r\nrenew the growth of our national authority and maintain it in the Union,\r\nwill, at the same time, establish its predominant influence on the\r\ncontinent. Having overborne and rooted out every opposing principle\r\nwithin the boundaries of our own imperial domain, its growth will be so\r\nmajestic that every unfriendly influence which may possibly have secured\r\na feeble foothold in its vicinity during its perilous struggle, will\r\nsoon wither in the shadow of its greatness and disappear from around it.\r\nForeign nations may exert their sinister authority in the Old World, and\r\nplant their peculiar institutions in that congenial soil, with their\r\naccustomed success; but no amount of skilful manipulation will preserve\r\nthese exotics when transplanted in the American soil. The prevailing\r\nelements are not suited to their organization; they cannot be\r\nnaturalized and acclimated. This continent, with its peculiar population\r\nand antecedents, has its own political _fauna_ and _flora_, fixed by\r\nnature and destiny, which cannot be utterly changed at the will of any\r\nhuman authority.\r\n\r\nThe most wicked and disastrous experiment of the age has been tried upon\r\nthe grandest scale. It was a bold undertaking to break up the American\r\nUnion, and to arrest the progress of its benign principles. To the great\r\nrelief and joy of almost universal humanity, the monstrous attempt is\r\nabout to result in disgraceful failure. Yet this prodigious enterprise\r\nof destruction was initiated under the most favorable circumstances,\r\nwith the most auspicious promise for its fatal success. The malignant\r\nenvy of all the instruments of despotism throughout the whole civilized\r\nworld were brought to bear against us for the accomplishment of a work\r\nof stupendous ruin--the annihilation of American nationality, American\r\npower, and American freedom. All the bad, restless, retrogressive\r\nelements of our own population sought alliance with the foreign enemies\r\nof human liberty; and, for the most selfish and detestable of all social\r\nand political schemes, attempted to prostrate the paternal government of\r\ntheir country, before the expiration of the first century of its\r\nunexampled career. Vast armies of deluded citizens, led by degenerate\r\nsons of the republic--ingrates, educated at her own military\r\nschools--have impiously defied her lawful authority, and sometimes\r\nassailed her with unnatural triumph over her arms; while foreign\r\ncapital, subsidized by prospective piratical plunder, has filled the\r\nocean with daring cruisers to destroy her commerce, and thus to weaken\r\nthe right hand of her power. Feathers from the wing of her own eagle\r\nhave plumed the arrows directed at her heart; while the barb has been\r\nsteeled and sharpened by the aid of mercenary enemies in distant\r\nlands--aid purchased by means of the robberies which have desolated one\r\nhalf the land. Deep and dangerous have been the wounds inflicted on our\r\nunhappy country through this shameless combination of traitors at home\r\nand enemies of humanity abroad; but she still stands erect, though\r\nbleeding, with her great strength yet comparatively undiminished, and\r\nwith her foot uplifted ready to be planted on the breast of her\r\nprostrate foes. She holds aloft the glorious banner, its stars still\r\nundimmed, and with her mild but penetrating voice, she still proclaims\r\nthe principles of universal freedom to all who may choose to claim it;\r\nand with the sublimity of the most exalted human charity, she invites\r\neven the fallen enemy--the misguided betrayers of their country--to\r\nreturn to her bosom and share the protection of her generous\r\ninstitutions. In the hour of her triumph she seeks no bloody vengeance,\r\nbut tenders a magnanimous forgiveness to her repenting children, wooing\r\nthem back to the shelter of re-established liberty and vindicated law.\r\nAll hail to the republic in the splendor of her coming triumph and the\r\nrenewal of her beneficent power!\r\n\r\nIt has not been within the ability of reckless treason and armed\r\nrebellion to break down the Constitution of the country and permanently\r\ndestroy its institutions; so will it be as far beyond the capacity, as\r\nit ought to be distant from the thoughts of the men now wielding the\r\nFederal authority, to operate unauthorized changes in the fundamental\r\nlaw which they have solemnly sworn to support. The strength of the\r\npeople has been put forth, through the Government--their blood has been\r\nprofusely poured out, for the sole purpose of maintaining its legitimate\r\nascendency, and of overthrowing and removing the obstacles opposed by\r\nthe hand of treason to its constitutional action. To uphold the\r\nsupremacy of the Constitution and laws, is the very object of the war;\r\nand it would be a gross perversion of the authority conferred and a\r\npalpable misuse of the means so amply provided by Congress, to use them\r\nfor the purpose of defeating the very end intended to be accomplished.\r\nNeither the legislative nor the executive department of the Government\r\ncould legitimately undertake to destroy or change the Constitution, from\r\nwhich both derive their existence and all their lawful power. It is true\r\nthat pending a war, either foreign or civil, the Constitution itself\r\nconfers extraordinary powers upon the Government--powers far\r\ntranscending those which it may properly exercise in time of peace.\r\nThese war powers, however, great as they are, and limited only by the\r\nlaws of and usages civilized nations, are not extra-constitutional; they\r\nare expressly conferred, and are quite as legitimate as those more\r\nmoderate ones which appropriately belong to the Government in ordinary\r\ntimes. But when there is no longer any war--when the Government shall\r\nhave succeeded in completely suppressing the rebellion--what then will\r\nbe the proper principle of action? Will not the Constitution of itself,\r\nby the simple force of its own terms, revert to its ordinary operation,\r\nand spread its benign protection over every part of the country? Will\r\nnot all the States, returning to their allegiance, be entitled to hold\r\ntheir place in the Union, upon the same footing which they held prior to\r\nthe fatal attempt at secession? These are indeed momentous questions,\r\ndemanding a speedy solution.\r\n\r\nIf we say that the Federal Government may put the States upon any\r\ndifferent footing than that established by the existing Constitution,\r\nthen we virtually abrogate that instrument which accurately prescribes\r\nthe means by which alone its provisions can be altered or amended. But,\r\non the other hand, if we concede the right of each State, after making\r\nwar on the Union until it is finally conquered, quietly to return and\r\ntake its place again with all the rights and privileges it held before,\r\njust as if nothing had happened in the _interim_, then, indeed, do we\r\nmake of the Federal Government a veritable temple of discord. We subject\r\nit to the danger of perpetual convulsions, without the power to protect\r\nitself except by the repetition of sanguinary wars, whenever the caprice\r\nor ambition of any State might lead her into the experiment of\r\nrebellion. Between these two unreasonable and contradictory\r\nalternatives--the right of the Government to change its forms, and the\r\nright of the rebellious State to assume its place in the union without\r\nconditions--there must be some middle ground upon which both parties may\r\nstand securely without doing violence to any constitutional principle.\r\nThe Federal Government is clothed with power, and has imposed upon it\r\nthe duty, to conquer the rebellion. This is an axiom in the political\r\nphilosophy of every true Union man, and we therefore do not stop to\r\nargue a point disputed only by the enemies of our cause. But if the\r\nGovernment has power to conquer the domestic enemy in arms against it,\r\nthen, as a necessary consequence, it must be the sole judge as to when\r\nthe conquest has been accomplished; in other words, it must pronounce\r\nwhen and in what manner the state of internal war shall cease to exist.\r\nThis implies nothing more than the right claimed by every belligerent\r\npower, and always exercised by the conqueror--that of deciding for\r\nitself how far the war shall be carried--what amount of restraint and\r\npunishment shall be inflicted--what terms of peace shall be imposed.\r\nThe Constitution of the United States does not seem to contemplate the\r\nholding, by the Federal Government, of any State as a conquered and\r\ndependent province; but in authorizing it to suppress rebellion, it\r\nconfers every power necessary to do the work effectually. It authorizes\r\nthe use of the whole military means of the Government, to be applied in\r\nthe most unrestricted manner, for the destruction of the rebellious\r\npower. If a State be in rebellion, then the State itself may be held and\r\nrestrained by military power, so long as may be necessary, in order to\r\nsecure its obedience to the Federal laws and the due performance of its\r\nconstitutional obligations. It would be contradictory and wholly\r\ndestructive of the right of suppressing rebellion by military power, to\r\nadmit the irreconcilable right of the State unconditionally to assume\r\nits place in the Union, only to renew the war at its own pleasure.\r\nActing in good faith, the Federal Government has the undoubted right to\r\nprovide for its own security, and to follow its military measures with\r\nall those supplementary proceedings which are usual and appropriate to\r\nthis end. This principle surely cannot be questioned; and if so, it\r\ninvolves everything, leaving the question one only of practical\r\nexpediency and of good faith in the choice of means.\r\n\r\nBut it is said there is and indeed can be no war between the Government\r\nand any of the States; but only between the former, and certain\r\nrebellious individuals in the States. We are well aware that in the\r\nordinary operation of the Federal Government, it acts directly on\r\nindividuals and not on States. The cause of this arrangement and its\r\npurpose are well understood. But in case of war or insurrection, the\r\npower must be coextensive with the emergency which calls it forth. If\r\nStates are actually in rebellion, then of necessity the Government must\r\ntreat that fact according to its real nature. The fiction of supposing\r\nthe State to be loyal when its citizens are all traitors, and of\r\nconsidering it incapable of insurrection when all its authorities are\r\nnotoriously in open rebellion, would be not less pernicious in its folly\r\nand imbecility than it would be absurd to the common sense of mankind.\r\nUndoubtedly it may be true in some instances, that the rebellion has\r\nusurped authority in the States. The will of the people may have been\r\nutterly disregarded, and set aside by violence or fraud. The\r\ninsurrectionary government of the State may be only the government _de\r\nfacto_ and not _de jure_, using these terms with reference only to the\r\nState and its people, and not with reference to the paramount authority\r\nof the Union which, under all circumstances, deprives the\r\ninsurrectionary State organization of any legal character whatever. In\r\nall cases of such usurped authority, the people of the States would have\r\nthe unquestionable right to be restored to the Union upon the terms of\r\ntheir recent connection, without any conditions whatever. It would be\r\nthe solemn duty of the United States to defend each one of its members\r\nfrom the violence which might thus have overthrown its legitimate\r\ngovernment. But, on the other hand, when the people of the States\r\nthemselves have inaugurated the insurrectionary movement and have\r\nvoluntarily sustained it in its war upon the Government, then no such\r\nfavor can reasonably be claimed for them. If excitement and delusion\r\nhave suddenly hurried them into rebellion against their better judgments\r\nand their real inclinations, they are to be pitied for their misfortune,\r\nand ought to be treated with great leniency and favor; but they cannot\r\nclaim exemption from those conditions which may be imperatively demanded\r\nfor the future security and tranquillity of the country.\r\n\r\nIf by possibility there might be some technical legal difficulty in this\r\nview, there would be none whatever of a practical nature; for any mind\r\ngifted with the most ordinary endowment of reason would not fail to be\r\nimpressed with the gross inconsistency and inequality of holding that\r\nrebels may not only set aside the Constitution at their will and make\r\nwar for its destruction, but may set it up again and claim its\r\nprotection; while its defenders and faithful asserters must be held to\r\nsuch strict and impracticable regard for its provisions that they may\r\nnot take the precautions necessary to preserve it, even in the emergency\r\nof putting down a rebellion against it. Such an irrational predicament\r\nof constitutional difficulties and political contradictions would soon\r\nnecessitate its own solution. The revolution on the one side would\r\ninduce a similar revolutionary movement on the other; attempted\r\ndestruction by violence would justify the measures necessary to the\r\nrestoration of the Government and to its permanent security in the\r\nfuture. There would be little hesitation in adopting these measures in\r\nspite of any doubt as to their regularity. The public safety would be\r\nacknowledged as the supreme law, and they who had placed themselves in\r\nthe attitude of public enemies could not complain of the rigid\r\napplication of its requirements to them.\r\n\r\nThe most inveterate of the rebels certainly do not anticipate the\r\nrelaxation of this principle. They are careful to make known to the\r\nSouthern people the impossibility of returning to the Union, except upon\r\nsuch conditions as may be prescribed by the conquering power. It is true\r\nthey do this to deter their followers from indulging the thought of any\r\nrestoration of their former Federal relations; but this fact of itself\r\nshows their consciousness of the justice of the position. They have\r\nbetrayed their people into a situation from which they cannot reasonably\r\nhope to escape without making important concessions to the Federal\r\nGovernment. Their effort now is to convince the misguided population of\r\nthe South that the required concessions will be more intolerable than\r\nthe indefinite continuance of a hopeless and destructive civil war.\r\n\r\nThere is no necessity, however, to go beyond the limits of the\r\nConstitution; nor is there any reason to believe that the Government, in\r\nany event, will be disposed to exact terms inconsistent with the true\r\nspirit of our institutions. A great danger, such as now threatens our\r\ncountry, might, in some circumstances, justify a revolution, altering\r\neven the fundamental laws, for the purpose of preserving our national\r\nunity. The justification would depend upon the nature of the\r\ncircumstances--the extremity and urgency of the peril; and the change\r\nwould be recognized and defended as the result of violence, irregular\r\nand revolutionary. At a more tranquil period, in the absence of danger\r\nand excitement, it would be practicable to return to the former\r\nprinciples of political action; or, in case of necessity, the sanction\r\nof the people might be obtained in the forms prescribed by the\r\nConstitution, and the change found necessary in the revolutionary period\r\nwould either be approved and retained, modified, or altogether rejected.\r\n\r\nBut fortunately no constitutional obstacle whatever stands in the way of\r\nmaking such stipulations as may be appropriate between the Federal\r\nGovernment and the States; nor would they at all imply any admission of\r\nthe right of secession, or of the actual efficacy of the attempted\r\nwithdrawal from the Union. On the contrary, any agreement with the State\r\nwould, _ex vi termini_, admit the integrity of its organization under\r\nthe Constitution. Special agreements are usually made whenever a new\r\nState is admitted into the Union; and as all the States, old and new,\r\nstand upon an equal footing, there can be nothing in the ordinances\r\nusually adopted by the new States, conflicting with the principles on\r\nwhich the Government is organized. The States are prohibited from\r\nmaking 'any agreement or compact' with each other, without the consent\r\nof the Federal Government; but there is no prohibition against making\r\nsuch agreements with the Federal Government itself. What the new States\r\nmay do upon entering the Union, the old States may do at any time upon\r\nthe same conditions This principle was settled upon the admission of\r\nTexas into the Union; it has been sanctioned in many other instances;\r\nand we are not aware that there is or can be any question of its\r\nsoundness. Surely, if there could ever be an occasion proper for a\r\nsolemn compact between the General Government and any of the separate\r\nStates, it will be found at the conclusion of this unhappy war, when it\r\nwill be necessary to heal the wounds of the country, and provide for its\r\npermanent peace and security. To quell an insurrection so extensive,\r\ninvolving so many States in its daring treason, especially when it has\r\nassumed an organized form and been recognized not only by other nations\r\nbut even by ourselves, as a belligerent entitled to the rights of war,\r\nimplies the necessity, in addition to the annihilation of its armies and\r\nall its warlike resources, of removing the causes of its\r\ndissatisfaction, and destroying its means of exciting disturbance. The\r\nGovernment is by no means bound unconditionally to recognize the old\r\nrelations of States which, as such, have taken part in the rebellion;\r\nwhich have themselves repudiated all their constitutional rights and\r\nobligations; and which may again, at any time, renew the war, from the\r\nsame impulse and for the same cause. On the contrary, the close of the\r\ndisastrous contest will be a most favorable opportunity for compelling\r\nthe conquered insurrection to submit to terms such as will deprive it of\r\nall capacity for similar mischief in the future. The insurrection will\r\nnot be effectually suppressed unless its active principle is destroyed.\r\nNothing can be plainer than the right and the solemn duty of the\r\nGovernment in this great emergency.\r\n\r\nSupposing these principles to be admitted, there still remains for\r\ndetermination the most important question as to the nature of the\r\nconditions which ought to be exacted of the returning States--a problem\r\nof the most difficult character, involving the most delicate of all\r\nconsiderations, and demanding for its solution the highest practical\r\nstatesmanship and the most profound wisdom, based upon moderation,\r\nfirmness, liberality, and justice. In this problem several elements\r\nexist in complicated combination, and each one of these must be fairly\r\nconsidered in the adjustment whenever it may be made. The measures of\r\nsafety which the Government has been compelled to adopt in the progress\r\nof the war, and to which it may be committed without recall; the\r\ncondition of the rebellious States, and their demands and propositions;\r\nand finally, the interests, rights, and just expectations of the African\r\nrace, which has become so intimately involved in this terrible\r\nstrife--all these must be weighed accurately in the scales of truth, and\r\nwith the impartial hand of disinterested patriotism. No mere partisan\r\nconsiderations, no promptings of selfish ambition, and no miserable\r\nsectional enmities or fierce desires for revenge, ought to be allowed to\r\nmingle with our thoughts and feelings when we approach this great\r\nsubject of restoring peace and harmony to the people and States of this\r\nmighty republic. Awful will be the responsibility of those men in\r\nauthority, who shall fail to rise to the height of this momentous\r\nemergency in the history of our country--who shall be wanting in the\r\ncourage, the purity, the magnanimity necessary to save the nation from\r\ndisunion and anarchy.\r\n\r\nWhat ought to be the conditions upon which the rebellious States are to\r\nbe reëstablished in their old relations, it is perhaps premature now to\r\nattempt to determine. The war is not yet closed, although we are\r\nsufficiently sanguine to believe that we have already seen 'the\r\nbeginning of the end.' But the still nearer approach of the final acts\r\nin the great drama will give a mighty impetus to events, and many great\r\nchanges will be wrought in the condition of the Southern people, and in\r\ntheir feelings toward the Union, against which too many of them are\r\nstill breathing hate and vengeance. They have scarcely yet been\r\nsufficiently chastened even by the fiery ordeal through which they have\r\nbeen compelled to pass. Every day, however, increases the bitterness of\r\nthe scourge under which they suffer, and if it does not avail to humble\r\nthem, it tends at least to convince them, in their hearts, of the\r\nterrible mistake into which they have been led. We may well hope and\r\nbelieve that the masses of the people will soon be brought to that\r\nrational frame of mind which will incline them to acknowledge the\r\nirresistible exigencies of their situation, and to make those\r\nconcessions that may be found indispensable to peace and union. As we\r\napproach the moment of decisive action, experience will teach us the\r\nsolemn duty devolving upon us. While we may not at present anticipate\r\nfully what will then be necessary, we can nevertheless determine some\r\nfew principles of a general nature which must control the adjustment.\r\n\r\nWe will be compelled to consider not only the duty which the Government\r\nowes the people, in the matter of their own permanent security, but also\r\nthe obligations it has assumed, the promises it has made, and the hopes\r\nit has excited in the bondsmen of the rebellious States. There must be\r\ngood faith toward the black man. It would be infamous to have incited\r\nhim to escape from slavery only to remand him again, upon the\r\nrestoration of the Union, to the tender mercies of his master. What\r\ndifferences of opinion may have existed in the beginning as to the\r\nlegality and policy of the Proclamation and of employing the liberated\r\nslaves as soldiers, the Government and people are too far committed in\r\nthis line of action to be able now to withdraw without dishonour and\r\nfoul injustice. Many of the consequences of the war may be remedied, and\r\neven the last vestiges of them obliterated. Cities may be rebuilt,\r\ndesolated fields made to bloom again with prosperity, and commerce may\r\nreturn to its old channels with even increased activity and volume. Many\r\nwounds may be healed, and may separations may be brought to an end by\r\nthe renewal of friendships broken by the war; but the separation of the\r\nslave from his mater, so far as it has been caused by any action of the\r\nGovernment, can never be remedied. That must be an eternal separation,\r\nresting for its security upon the humanity as well as the honor of the\r\nAmerican people. What! Shall we restore the States unconditionally, and\r\npermit the fugitive slave law again to operate as it did before the\r\nrebellion? Shall we consent to see the men whom we have invited away\r\nfrom the South dragged back into slavery tenfold more severe by reason\r\nof our act inducing them to escape? This is plainly impossible. Argument\r\nis wholly out of place; felling and conscience revolt at the very idea.\r\nIt may be admitted that this question, with its peculiar complications,\r\npresents the most difficult and dangerous of all problems; but there is\r\nno alternative: we must meet and solve it at the close of this\r\nrebellion. We have to combat the selfish interests of a class still\r\npowerful, aided by the great strength of a popular prejudice almost\r\nuniversal. The emergency will require the exertion of all our wisdom and\r\nall our energy.\r\n\r\nThe vast body of slaves in the South have not yet been incited to\r\naction, either by the movements of our armies or by the potency of the\r\nProclamation. Whether they will be, and to what extent, depends upon the\r\ncontinuance of the war, and its future progress. The result in this\r\nparticular remains to be seen, and cannot now be anticipated. What legal\r\neffect the measures of the Government may have upon the slaves remaining\r\nin the South would be a question for the decision of the courts; and\r\ndoubtless most of them would be entitled to liberation as the penalty of\r\nthe treason of their masters, who may have participated in the\r\nrebellion. But it is well worthy of consideration whether it would not\r\nbe wise and better for all parties, including the slaves, to commute\r\nthis penalty by a compact with the States for the gradual emancipation\r\nof the slaves remaining at the time of the negotiation. The sudden and\r\nutter overthrow of the existing organization of labor and capital in\r\nthose States, coming in addition to the awful devastation which the war\r\nhas produced, will deal a disastrous blow, not alone to those\r\nunfortunate States, but to the commerce and industry of the whole\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nBut neither the Government of the United States alone, nor this together\r\nwith the Africans, liberated and unliberated, can prescribe their own\r\nrequirements, as the law of the emergency, without reference to other\r\ngreat interests involved. The question must necessarily be controlled by\r\nthe sum of all the political elements which enter into it. It is\r\ndesirable to restore the States to the Union with as little\r\ndissatisfaction as possible, and even with all the alleviation which can\r\nproperly be afforded to the misfortunes of the people who have so sadly\r\nerred in their duty to themselves and to their country. After any\r\nsettlement--the most favorable that can be made--heavy will be the\r\npunishment inflicted by the great contest upon the unhappy population of\r\nthe rebellious region. In many things, it is true, they will suffer only\r\nin common with the people of all the States; but they will also have\r\ntheir own peculiar misfortunes in addition to the common burdens. A\r\ngenerous Government, in the hour of its triumph, will seek to lessen\r\nrather than to aggravate their misfortunes, even though resulting from\r\ntheir crimes. Having received them back into the bosom of the Union, it\r\nwill do so heartily and magnanimously, yielding everything which does\r\nnot involve a violation of principle, and endanger the future\r\ntranquillity of the country. The harmony of the States, their\r\nhomogeneity, and their general progress in all that contributes to the\r\ngreatness and happiness of communities, ought to be, and doubtless will\r\nbe, the benign object of the Government in the settlement of the\r\nexisting difficulty. If these high purposes necessarily require in their\r\ndevelopment a provision for the rapid disappearance of slavery, the\r\nrequirement will not arise from any remaining hostility to the returning\r\nStates; on the contrary, it will look to their own improvement and\r\nprosperity, quite as much as to the peace and security of the whole\r\ncountry. The day will yet arrive when these States themselves will\r\ngratefully acknowledge that all the sacrifices of the war will be fully\r\ncompensated by the advantages of that great and fundamental change,\r\nwhich they will undoubtedly now accept only with the utmost reluctance\r\nand aversion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAS HE SUCCESSFUL?\r\n\r\n     'Do but grasp into the thick of human life! Every one _lives_\r\n     it--to not many is it _known_; and seize it where you will, it be\r\n     interesting.'--GOETHE.\r\n\r\n     'SUCCESSFUL.--Terminating in accomplishing what is wished or\r\n     intended.'--WEBSTER'S _Dictionary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nHiram was never in serious difficulty before.\r\n\r\nWhen he came carefully to survey the situation, he felt greatly\r\nembarrassed, and in real distress. To understand this, you have only to\r\nrecollect what value he placed on church membership. In this he was\r\nperfectly sincere. He felt, too, as he afterward expressed it to Mr.\r\nBennett, that he had not 'acted just right toward Emma Tenant,' but he\r\nhad not the least idea the matter could possibly become a subject of\r\nchurch discipline. The day for such extraordinary supervision over one's\r\nprivate affairs had gone by, it is true, but Dr. Chellis, roused and\r\nindignant, would no doubt revive it on this occasion.\r\n\r\nHiram had absented himself the first Sunday after his interview with his\r\nclergyman, but on the following he ventured to take his accustomed seat.\r\nThe distant looks and cold return to his greeting which he received from\r\nthe principal members of the congregation, were unmistakable. Even the\r\nfemale portion, with whom he was such a favorite, had evidently declared\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\nHe had gone too far.\r\n\r\nHowever, he went into Sunday school, and took his accustomed seat with\r\nthe class under his instruction. It was the first time he had been with\r\nit since he left town to attend on his mother. The young gentleman who\r\nhad assumed a temporary charge of this class, which was one of the\r\nfinest in the school, shook hands with cool politeness with Hiram, but\r\ndid not offer to yield the seat. The latter, already nervous and ill at\r\nease by reason of his reception among his acquaintances, did not dare\r\nassume his old place, lest he should be told he had been superseded. He\r\ncontented himself with greeting his pupils, who appeared glad to see\r\nhim, and sitting quietly by while they recited their lesson. Then,\r\ntaking advantage of the few moments remaining, he gave them a pathetic\r\naccount of the loss of his mother, and exhorted them all to honor and\r\nobey their parents. In the afternoon he did not go back to church, but\r\nwent to hear Dr. Pratt, the clergyman who, the reader may recollect, had\r\nbeen recommended by Mr. Bennett on Hiram's first coming to new York. Our\r\nhero was not at all pleased with this latter gentleman. The fact is, to\r\na person of Hiram's subtle intellect, a man like Dr. Chellis was a\r\nthousand times more acceptable than a milk-and-water divine.\r\n\r\nFrom Dr. Pratt's, Hiram proceeded to his room, to take a careful survey\r\nof his position, and, as we said at the beginning of the chapter, he\r\nfound himself in serious difficulty, greatly embarrassed and in real\r\ndistress. He could not join another church, for a letter had been\r\nformally refused from his own. He could not remain where he was, for the\r\nfeeling there was too strong against him, besides, evidently, Dr.\r\nChellis was determined to institute damaging charges against him. He\r\nthought of attempting to make friends with Mr. and Mrs. Tenant, and\r\nhumbly asking them to intercede for him, but the recollection of his\r\nlast interview with Mrs, Tenant discouraged any hope of success. Emma,\r\nalas! was away, far away, else he would go and appeal to her--not to\r\nreinstate him as her accepted, but--to aid him to get right with Dr.\r\nChellis. Such were some of the thoughts that went through his brain as\r\nhe sat alone by his open window quite into the twilight. He felt worse\r\nand worse. Prayer did not help him, and every chapter which he read in\r\nthe Bible added to his misery. At last it occurred to him to step to his\r\ncousin's house, not far distant, and talk the whole matter over there.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mr. Bennett's family were out of town during the summer, he was\r\nobliged to remain most of the season, on account of his business. Up to\r\nthis time he had not mentioned the fact of the breaking his engagement;\r\nindeed, he had avoided the subject whenever the two had met, because he\r\nknew he was wrong, and there was something about Mr. Bennett,\r\nnotwithstanding his keen, shrewd, adroit mercantile habits, which was\r\nvery straightforward and aboveboard, and which Hiram disliked to\r\nencounter. Besides, he had always been praised by his cousin for his\r\ntact and management, and he felt exceedingly mortified at being obliged\r\nto confess himself cornered. But something must be done, and that\r\nspeedily. Yes, he would go and consult him. Hiram took his hat and\r\nwalked slowly to Mr. Bennett's house. He found him extended on a sofa in\r\nhis front parlor, quite alone and in the dark, enjoying apparently with\r\nmuch zest a fine Havana segar. It was by its light that Hiram was\r\nenabled to discover the smoker.\r\n\r\n'Why, Hiram, is it you? Glad to see you!'--so his greeting ran. 'Didn't\r\nknow you ever went out Sunday evenings except to church. Take a\r\nsegar--oh, you don't smoke. It's deuced lonesome here without the folks.\r\nMust try and get off for a week or two myself. Why didn't I think to ask\r\nyou to come and stay with me? Well, we will have some light on the\r\noccasion, and a cup of tea.' And he rose to ring the bell.\r\n\r\n'Not just yet, if you please,' said Hiram, checking the other. 'I want\r\nto have some conversation with you, and I need your advice. I am in\r\ntrouble.'\r\n\r\nBy a singular coincidence, these were the very words which Mr. Tenant\r\nemployed when he went to consult his friend Dr. Chellis. As Hiram\r\ndiffered totally from Mr. Tenant, so did the drygoods jobbing merchant\r\nfrom the Doctor. Both were first-rate advisers in their way: the Doctor\r\nin a humane and noble sort, after his kind; the merchant in a shrewd,\r\nadroit, quick-witted, fertile manner, after his kind.\r\n\r\nMr. Bennett and Hiram both sat on the sofa, even as the Doctor and Mr.\r\nTenant had sat together. It was quite dark, as I have said, and this\r\ngave Hiram a certain advantage in telling his story, for he dreaded his\r\ncousin's scrutinizing glance.\r\n\r\nMr. Bennett was much alarmed at Hiram's announcement. 'In trouble?' What\r\ncould that mean but financial disaster?\r\n\r\n'I was afraid he would speculate too much,' said Mr. Bennett to himself;\r\n'but how could he have got such a blow as this? I saw him the day after\r\nhis return, and he said everything had gone well in his absence.'\r\n\r\nHe settled himself, however, resolutely to hear the worst, and, to his\r\npraise be it spoken, fully determined to do what he could to aid the\r\nyoung man in his difficulties.\r\n\r\nHiram was brief in his communication. When he chose, he could go as\r\nstraight to the point as any one. He did not attempt to gloss over his\r\nstory, but put his cousin in possession of the facts pretty much as the\r\nreader understands them.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if Mr. Bennett was much relieved by the communication.\r\nIndeed, I think he would have preferred to have some pecuniary tangle\r\nout of which to extricate his cousin. In fact, it was impossible for him\r\nto suppress a feeling of contempt, not to say disgust, at Hiram's\r\nconduct. For, worldly minded as he was, It was what he never would have\r\nbeen guilty of. Indeed, it so happened that Mr. Bennett had actually\r\nmarried his wife under circumstances quite similar, three months after\r\nher father's failure, and one month after his death; so that where be\r\nexpected a fortune, he had taken a portionless wife and her widowed\r\nmother. What is more, he did it cheerfully, and was, as he used to say,\r\nthe happiest fellow in the world in consequence. It would have been\r\nsingular, therefore, if while hearing Hiram's story he had not recurred\r\nto his own history. In indulging his contempt for him, he unconsciously\r\npractised an innocent self-flattery.\r\n\r\nHe did not immediately reply after Hiram concluded, but waited for this\r\nfeeling to subside, and for the old worldly leaven to work again.\r\n\r\n'A nice mess you're in,' he said, at length, 'and all from not seeking\r\nmy advice in time. Do you know, Hiram, you made a great mistake in\r\ngiving up that girl? I'm not talking of any matter of affection or\r\nsentiment or happiness, or about violating pledges and promises. That is\r\nyour own affair, and I've nothing to do with it. I have often told you\r\nthat you have much to learn yet, and here is a tremendous blunder to\r\nprove it. The connection would have been as good as a hundred thousand\r\ndollars cash capital, if the girl hadn't a cent. That clique is a\r\npowerful one, and they all hang together. Mark my words: they won't let\r\nthe old man go under, and it would have been a fortune to you to have\r\nstood by him. You've taken a country view of this business, Hiram. There\r\nevery man tries to pull his neighbor down. Here, we try to build one\r\nanother up.'\r\n\r\n'You are doubtless correct,' replied Hiram, 'but the mischief is done,\r\nand I want you to help me remedy it. If you can't aid me, nobody can.'\r\n\r\nMr. Bennett was not insensible to the compliment.\r\n\r\n'Certainly, certainly,' he answered, 'you know you can count on me. I\r\nhave always told you that you could, and I meant what I said. But you\r\nmust permit me to point out your mistakes, and I tell you you should\r\nhave asked my advice in this affair.'\r\n\r\n'Very true.'\r\n\r\n'You think Dr. Chellis won't yield?'\r\n\r\n'I am sure of it.'\r\n\r\nMr. Bennett sat fixed in thought for at least five minutes, during which\r\ntime, I am inclined to think, Hiram's countenance, could it have been\r\nseen through the darkness, would have been a study for an artist. For it\r\ndoubtless exhibited (because it could _not_ be seen) his actual feelings\r\nand anxieties. He was startled at last into an exclamation of fright by\r\nreceiving an unexpected slap on his shoulder, which came from Mr.\r\nBennett, who, rising at that moment, gave this as a token of having\r\narrived at a happy solution of the difficulty. In this respect he was as\r\nabrupt as Dr. Chellis had been with his friend.\r\n\r\n'The thing is settled. There is but one course to pursue, and you must\r\ntake it. I will explain when we can have more light on the subject, to\r\nsay nothing of our cup of tea.'\r\n\r\nHe rang the bell, the parlor was lighted, and tea served, when Mr.\r\nBennett again broke the silence.\r\n\r\n'Hiram,' he said, abruptly, 'you must quit the Presbyterian church.'\r\n\r\nHiram's heart literally stopped beating. He turned deadly pale.\r\n\r\nMr. Bennett perceived it. 'Don't be frightened,' he said. 'You have made\r\na great mistake, and I would help you repair it. I repeat, you must quit\r\nthe Presbyterian church, and you must join ours. You must indeed,' he\r\ncontinued, seeing Hiram look undecided.\r\n\r\n'Does it teach the true salvation?' asked Hiram, doubtingly.\r\n\r\n'How can you ask such a question?' replied Mr. Bennett, in a severe\r\ntone; 'are we not in the apostolic line? Are not the ordinances\r\nadministered by a clergy whose succession has never been broken?\r\nYou--you Presbyterians, _may_ possibly be saved by the grace of God, but\r\nyou have really no church, no priesthood, no ordinances. We won't\r\ndiscuss this. I will introduce you to our clergyman, and you shall\r\nexamine the subject for yourself. Perhaps you don't know it, Hiram, but\r\nI have been confirmed; yes, I was confirmed last spring. When I had that\r\nfit of sickness in the winter, I thought more about these matters than I\r\never did before, and I came to the conclusion that it was my duty to be\r\nconfirmed. I have felt much more comfortable ever since, I assure you.\r\nMy wife, you know, is a strict churchwoman. She and you will agree first\r\nrate if you come with us. For my part, I don't pretend to be so very\r\nexact. I believe in the spirit more than the letter, and our clergyman\r\ndon't find any fault with me. What say you, will you call on him? If\r\nyes, I will open up a little plan which I have this moment concocted for\r\nyour particular benefit. But you must first become a churchman.\r\n\r\nHiram sat stupefied, horrified, in a trance, in a maze. Cast loose from\r\nhis church, within whose pale he was accustomed to think salvation could\r\nonly be found, the possibility that there might be hope for him in\r\nanother quarter nearly took away his senses. He had been accustomed to\r\nregard the Episcopalians as little better than Papists, and _they_ were\r\nthe veritable children of wrath. Could he have been mistaken? He was now\r\nwilling to hope so. It could certainly do no harm to confer with the\r\nclergyman. He would hear what he had to say, and then judge for himself,\r\nand so he told his cousin.\r\n\r\n'All right; you talk like a sensible man. Now, Hiram, between us two, I\r\nam going to find you a wife.'\r\n\r\nHiram started. His pulse began again to beat naturally.\r\n\r\n'Yes, I have found you a wife, that is, if you will do as I advise you,\r\ninstead of following your own head. I tell you what it is, Hiram; you're\r\ngreen in these matters.'\r\n\r\nHiram smiled an incredulous smile, and asked, in a tone which betrayed a\r\ngood deal of interest, 'Who is the young lady?'\r\n\r\n'Never mind who she is until you come over to us. Then my wife shall\r\nintroduce you. But I'll tell you this much, Hiram: she has a clear two\r\nhundred thousand dollars--no father, no mother, already of age, in our\r\nfirst society, and very aristocratic.'\r\n\r\n'Is she pious?' asked Hiram, eagerly.\r\n\r\n'Excessively so. Fact is, she is the strictest young woman in the church\r\nin--Lent. She belongs to all the charitable societies, and gives away I\r\ndon't know how much.'\r\n\r\n'Humph,' responded Hiram. The last recommendation did not seem specially\r\nto take with him. Still his eyes glistened at the recital. He could not\r\nresist asking several questions about the young lady, but Mr. Bennett\r\nwas firm, and would not communicate further till Hiram's decision was\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nThus conversing, they fell into a pleasant mood, and so the evening wore\r\naway. When Hiram rose to leave, he found it was nearly midnight. His\r\ncousin insisted he should remain with him, and Hiram was glad to accept\r\nthe invitation. He did not feel like returning to his solitary room with\r\nhis mind unsettled and his feelings discomposed.\r\n\r\nIn a most confidential mood the two walked up stairs together, and Mr.\r\nBennett bade Hiram good night in a tone so cheerful that the latter\r\nentered his room quite reassured. He proceeded, as was his habit, to\r\nread a chapter in the Bible, but his teeth chattered when, on opening\r\nthe volume, he discovered it to be--the prayer book!--something he had\r\nbeen accustomed to hold in utter abomination. He controlled his feelings\r\nsufficiently to glance through the book, and at last, selecting a\r\nchapter from the Psalter, he perused it and retired. He dreamed that he\r\nwas married to the rich girl, and had the two hundred thousand dollars\r\nsafe in his possession. And so real did this seem that he woke in the\r\nmorning greatly disappointed to find himself minus so respectable a sum.\r\n\r\n'I must not lose the chance,' said Hiram to himself, as he jumped out of\r\nbed. 'With that amount in cash I would teach all South street a lesson.\r\nI wonder if this is the true church after all;' and he took up the\r\nprayer book this time without fear, as if determined to find out.\r\n\r\nHe spent some time in reading the prayers, and confessed to himself that\r\nthey were quite unobjectionable. Mr. Bennett's warning that there was no\r\ncertainty of salvation, out of the _church_ (i.e. his church) was not\r\nwithout its effect. As Hiram sought religion for the purpose of security\r\non the other side, you can readily suppose any question of the validity\r\nof his title would make him very nervous; once convinced of his mistake,\r\nhe would hasten to another church, just as he would change his insurance\r\npolicies, when satisfied of the insolvency of the company which had\r\ntaken his risks.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast Hiram renewed the subject of the last night's\r\nconversation, and Mr. Bennett was pleased to find that his views were\r\nalready undergoing a decided change.\r\n\r\n'Now, Hiram,' he exclaimed, 'if you do come over to us, it's no reason\r\nyou should join _my_ church. You may not like our clergyman. You know,\r\nwhen you first came to New York, I recommended you to join Dr. Pratt's\r\ncongregation instead of Dr. Chellis's; but you wanted severe preaching,\r\nand you have had it. Now there are similar varieties among the\r\nEpiscopalians. Dr. Wing, though a strict churchman, will give you sharp\r\nexercise, if you listen to him. He will handle you without gloves. He is\r\nfond of using the sword of the spirit, and you had best stand from\r\nunder, or he will cleave you through and through. My clergyman, Mr.\r\nMyrtle, is a very different man. He believes in the gospel as a message\r\nof peace and love, and his sermons are beautiful. One feels so safe and\r\nhappy to hear him discourse of the mercy of God, and the joys of\r\nheaven.'\r\n\r\n'Nevertheless,' replied Hiram, stoutly, 'I hold to my old opinion, and I\r\nconfess I prefer such a preacher as Dr. Wing to one like Mr. Myrtle. But\r\nunder existing circumstances I shall go with you.'\r\n\r\nHe was thinking about the splendid match Mr. Bennett had hinted at.\r\n\r\n'I am glad to hear you say so,' said Mr. Bennett; 'it will bring us more\r\nfrequently together. You have a brilliant future, if you will listen to\r\nme; but it won't do to make another blunder, such as you have just\r\ncommitted.'\r\n\r\n'I suppose you will tell me now about that young lady?' asked Hiram,\r\nwith an interest he could not conceal.\r\n\r\n'Not one word, not one syllable,' replied the other, good humoredly,\r\n'until you are actually within the pale. Don't be alarmed,' he\r\ncontinued, seeing Hiram look disappointed. 'To tell you would not do the\r\nleast good, and might frustrate my plans. But I will work the matter for\r\nyou, my boy, if it is a possible thing; and for my part I see no\r\ndifficulty in it. When my family come in town we will organize. Meantime\r\nlet me ask, have you learned to waltz?'\r\n\r\n'To waltz?' exclaimed Hiram, in horror. 'No. I don't even know how to\r\n_dance_; I was taught to believe it sinful. As to waltzing, how can you\r\nask me if I practise such a disgusting, such an immoral style of\r\nperformance, invented by infidel German students to give additional zest\r\nto their orgies.'\r\n\r\n'Did Dr. Chellis tell you that,' said Mr. Bennett, with something like a\r\nsneer.\r\n\r\n'No; I read it in the _Christian Herald_.'\r\n\r\n'I thought so. Dr. Chellis has too much sense to utter such stuff.'\r\n\r\n'Does Mr. Myrtle approve of waltzing?' inquired Hiram, with a groan.\r\n\r\n'Hiram, don't be a goose. Of course, Mr. Myrtle does not exactly\r\n_approve_ of it. That is, he don't waltz himself, his wife don't waltz,\r\nand his children are not old enough; but he does not object to any\r\n'rational amusement,' and he leaves his congregation to decide what _is_\r\nrational.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I shall not waltz, that's certain.'\r\n\r\n'Yes you will, too. The girl you are to marry--the girl who has a clear\r\ntwo hundred thousand in her own right--_she_ waltzes, and _you_ have got\r\nto waltz.'\r\n\r\nHiram's head swam, as if already giddy in the revolving maze; but it was\r\nthe thought of the two hundred thousand dollars, nothing else, which\r\nturned his brain. The color in his face went and came; he hesitated.\r\n\r\n'I will think of it,' at last he ejaculated.\r\n\r\n'Of course you will,' cried Mr. Bennett, 'of course you will, and decide\r\nlike a sensible man afterward, not like an idiot; but you must decide\r\nquick, for I must put you in training for the fall campaign.'\r\n\r\n'What do you mean?'\r\n\r\n'Why, simply this; the girl will not look at you unless you are a\r\nfashionable fellow--don't put on any more wry faces, but think of the\r\nprize--and I must have you well up in all the accomplishments. For the\r\nrest, you are what I call, a finely-formed, good-looking, and rather\r\ngraceful fellow, if you are my cousin.'\r\n\r\nHiram's features relaxed.\r\n\r\n'When can I call on Mr. Myrtle?' he asked.\r\n\r\n'Not for several weeks. He is taking a longer vacation than usual.\r\nHowever, come with me every Sunday, and you will hear Mr. Strang, our\r\ncurate, who officiates in Mr. Myrtle's absence. A most excellent man,\r\nand a very fair preacher.'\r\n\r\n'Have you a Sunday school connected with the church?'\r\n\r\n'Do you think we are heathen, Hiram? Have we a Sunday school? I should\r\nsuppose so! What is more, the future Mrs. Meeker is one of the\r\nteachers,'\r\n\r\n'Yet she waltzes?'\r\n\r\n'Yet she waltzes.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I hope I shall understand this better by and by.'\r\n\r\n'Certainly you will.'\r\n\r\nThe two proceeded down town to their business.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a very few days after, Hiram Meeker was the pupil--the private\r\npupil--of Signor Alberto, dancing master to _the_ aristocracy of the\r\ntown. [That is not what he called himself, but I wish to be\r\nintelligible.] Alberto had directions to perfect his pupil in every step\r\npractised in the world of fashion. Hiram proved an apt and ready\r\nscholar. He gave this new branch of education the same care and\r\nassiduity that he always practised in everything he undertook. Mr.\r\nBennett was not out of the way in praising his parts. Signor Alberto was\r\ndelighted with his pupil. His rapid progress was a source of great\r\npleasure to the master. To be sure, he could not get on quite as well as\r\nif he had consented to go in with a class; but this Hiram would not\r\nthink of. Still the matter was managed without much difficulty, as the\r\nSignor could always command supernumeraries.\r\n\r\nWhen it came to the waltz, Alberto was kind enough to introduce to Hiram\r\na young lady--a friend of his--who, he said, was perfectly familiar with\r\nevery measure; and who would, as a particular favor, take the steps with\r\nhim, under the master's special direction. It took Hiram's breath away,\r\npoor fellow, to be thrown so closely into the embraces of such a\r\nfine-looking, and by no means diffident damsel. It was what he had not\r\nbeen accustomed to. True, _he_ had been in the habit at one time of\r\nplaying the flirt, of holding the girls' hands in his, and pressing them\r\nsignificantly, and sighing and talking sentimental nonsense; but here\r\nthe tables were turned. Hiram was the bashful one, and the young lady\r\napparently the flirt. She explained, with, tantalizing _nonchalance_,\r\nhow he ought to take a more encircling hold of her waist. She\r\nillustrated _practically_ the different methods--close waltzing, medium\r\nwaltzing, and waltzing at arms' length. She would waltz light and\r\nheavy--observing to Hiram that he might on some occasion have an awkward\r\npartner, and it was well to be prepared.\r\n\r\nTo better explain, the young lady would become the gentleman; and in\r\nwhirling Hiram round, she exhibited a strength and vigor truly\r\nastonishing.\r\n\r\nAll the while Hiram, with quick breath, and heightened color, and\r\nwhirling brain, was striving hard and failing fast to keep his wits\r\nabout him. What was most annoying of all, the young lady, though so\r\naccommodating and familiar as a partner to practise with under the\r\nmaster's eye, when the exercise was over appeared perfectly and\r\nabsolutely indifferent to Hiram. She was quite insensible to every\r\nlittle byplay of his to attract her notice, which, as he advanced in her\r\nacquaintance, he began to practice before the lesson commenced, or after\r\nit was finished. The fact is, whoever or whatever she might be, she\r\nevidently held Hiram in great contempt as a greenhorn. Strange to say,\r\nfor once all his powers of fascination failed; and the more he tried to\r\ncall them forth, the more signal was his discomfiture. It does not\r\nappear that Hiram, after finishing his education with Signor Alberto,\r\nattempted to continue his acquaintance with his partner in the waltz.\r\nOnce during the course he did ask the young lady where she lived, and\r\nintimated that he would be pleased to call and see her; but the\r\nobservation was received with such evident signs of dissatisfaction,\r\nthat he never renewed the subject, and it is doubtful if he ever\r\nexplained to himself satisfactorily his failure to get in the good\r\ngraces of such a handsome girl and so perfect a waltzer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Augustus Myrtle, rector of St. Jude's, was one of those\r\ncircumstances of nature which are only to be encountered in metropolitan\r\nlife. This seems a paradox. I will explain. All his qualities were born\r\nwith him, not acquired, and those qualities could only shine in the\r\naristocratic and fashionable circles of a large city. As animals by\r\ninstinct avoid whatever is noxious and hurtful, so Augustus Myrtle from\r\nhis infancy by instinct avoided all poor people and all persons not in\r\nthe 'very first society.'\r\n\r\nChildren are naturally democrats; school is a great leveller. Augustus\r\nMyrtle recognized no such propositions. While a boy at the academy,\r\nwhile a youth in college, he sought the intimacy of boys and youths of\r\nrich persons of _ton_. It was not enough that a young fellow was well\r\nbred and had a good social position--he must be rich. It was not enough\r\nthat he was rich--he must have position.\r\n\r\nI do not think that Augustus Myrtle sat down carefully to calculate all\r\nthis. So I say it was instinctive--born with him. A person who frequents\r\nonly the society of the well bred and the wealthy must, to a degree at\r\nleast, possess refined and elegant and expensive tastes, and it was so\r\nin the case of Myrtle. His tastes were refined and elegant and\r\nexpensive.\r\n\r\nHis parents were themselves people of respectability, but very poor. His\r\nmother used to say that her son's decided predilections were in\r\nconsequence of her unfortunate state of mind the season Augustus was\r\nborn, when poverty pinched the family sharply. Mr. Myrtle was a man of\r\ncollegiate education, with an excellent mind, but totally unfitted for\r\nactive life. The result was, after marrying a poor girl, who was,\r\nhowever, of the 'aristocracy,' he became, through the influence of her\r\nfriends, the librarian of the principal library in a neighboring city,\r\nwith a fair salary, on which, with occasional sums received for\r\nliterary productions, he managed to bring up and support his small\r\nfamily. At times, when some unexpected expenses had to be incurred, as I\r\nhave hinted, poverty seemed to poor Mrs. Myrtle a very great hardship,\r\nand such was their situation the year Augustus was born.\r\n\r\nHe was the only son, and the hope of the parents centred on him. It was\r\nsettled that he should be sent to the best schools and to a first-class\r\ncollege. He had, perhaps, rather more than ordinary ability, the power\r\nto display to the best advantage the talents and acquirements he did\r\npossess, together with attractive manners, which, though reserved, were\r\npleasing. He was slight, gracefully formed, and a little above the\r\nordinary height. He had a dark complexion, a face thin and colorless,\r\nwith fine, large, black eyes.\r\n\r\nWhen I say Augustus Myrtle sought only the intimacy of the rich and well\r\nbred, you must not suppose he was a toady, or practised obsequiously.\r\nNot at all. He mingled with his associates, assuming to be one of\r\nthem--their equal. True, his want of money led to desperate economical\r\ncontrivances behind the scenes, but on the stage he betrayed by no sign\r\nthat affairs did not flow as smoothly with him as with his companions.\r\nIn all this, he had in his mother great support and encouragement. Her\r\nrelations were precisely of the stamp Augustus desired to cultivate, and\r\nthis gave him many advantages. As usually happens, he found what he\r\nsought. By the aid of the associations he had formed with so much\r\nassiduity, to say nothing of his own personal recommendations, he\r\nmarried a nice girl, the only child of a widowed lady _in the right\r\n'set' and with sixty thousand dollars_, besides a considerable\r\nexpectancy on the mother's decease. Shortly after, he became rector of\r\nSt. Jude's, the most exclusive 'aristocratic' religious establishment in\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\nAt this present period, the Rev. Augustus Myrtle was but thirty-five,\r\nand, from his standing and influence, he considered it no presumption to\r\nlook forward to the time when he should become bishop of the diocese.\r\n\r\nHis health was excellent, if we may except some _very_ slight\r\nindications of weakness of the larynx, which had been the cause of his\r\nmaking two excursions to Europe, each of six months' duration, which\r\nwere coupled with an appropriation of twenty-five hundred dollars by his\r\nindulgent congregation to pay expenses.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Myrtle and his family were still absent, Hiram had made very\r\nsensible progress in mastering the mysteries of the Episcopal form of\r\nworship, and became fully versed in certain doctrinal points, embracing\r\nall questions of what constitutes a 'church' and a proper 'succession.'\r\nHis investigations were carried on under the direction of the Rev. Mr.\r\nStrang, a man of feeble mind (Mr. Myrtle was careful to have no one near\r\nhim unless the contrast was to his advantage), but a worthy and\r\nconscientious person, who believed he was doing Heaven service in\r\nbringing Hiram into the fold of the true church. Hiram was again in his\r\nelement as an object of religious interest. Before the rector had\r\nreturned, he became very impatient to see him. It was a long while since\r\nhe had been at communion, and he began to fear his hold on heaven would\r\nbe weakened by so long an absence from that sacrament. Besides, he felt\r\nquite prepared and ready to be confirmed.\r\n\r\nThe Myrtles returned at last. In due time, Mrs. Bennett talked the whole\r\nmatter over with Mrs. Myrtle. Hiram was represented as 'a very rich\r\nyoung merchant, destined to be a leading man in the city--of an ancient\r\nand honorable New England family--very desirable in the church--a\r\ncousin'--[here several sentences were uttered in a whisper, accompanied\r\nby nods and signs significant, which I shall never be able to\r\ntranslate]--'must secure him--ripe for it now.'\r\n\r\nI think I forgot to say that Mrs. Myrtle and Mrs. Bennett were in the\r\nsame 'set' as young ladies, and were very intimate.\r\n\r\nThe nest day Mrs. Bennett opened the subject to Mr. Myrtle, his wife\r\nhaving duly prepared him. The object was to introduce Hiram into the\r\nchurch in the most effective manner. This could only be done through the\r\ninstrumentality of the reverend gentleman himself. Everything went\r\nsmoothly. Mr. Myrtle was not insensible to the value of infusing new and\r\nfresh elements into his congregation.\r\n\r\n'Of course,' he observed, 'this wealthy young man will take an entire\r\npew.' (The annual auction of rented pews was soon to come off, and Mr.\r\nMyrtle liked marvellously to see strong competition. It spoke well for\r\nthe church.)\r\n\r\n'He will _purchase_ a pew, if a desirable one can be had,' answered Mrs.\r\nBennett.\r\n\r\n'Oh, that is well. How fortunate! The Winslows are going to Europe to\r\nreside, and I think will sell theirs. One of the best in the church.\r\nPray ask Mr. Bennett to look after it.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you. How very considerate, how very thoughtful! We will see to it\r\nat once.'\r\n\r\nThe interview ended, after some further conversation, in a manner most\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was a magnificent autumnal afternoon, the second week of October,\r\nwhen Hiram Meeker, by previous appointment, called at the residence of\r\nthe Rev. Augustus Myrtle. The house was built on to the church, so as to\r\ncorrespond in architecture, and exhibited great taste in exterior as\r\nwell as interior arrangement. Hiram walked up the steps and boldly rang\r\nthe bell. He had improved a good deal in some respects since his passage\r\nat arms with Dr. Chellis, and while under the auspices of Mr. Bennett.\r\nHe had laid aside the creamy air he used so frequently to assume, and\r\nhad hardened himself, so to speak, against contingencies. I was saying\r\nhe marched boldly up and rang the bell.\r\n\r\nA footman in unexceptionable livery opened the door. Mr. Myrtle was\r\nengaged, but on Hiram's sending in his name, he was ushered into the\r\nfront parlor, and requested to sit, and informed that Mr. Myrtle would\r\nsee him in a few minutes. This gave Hiram time to look about him.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that it was the occasion of a preliminary gathering for\r\nthe season (there had been no meeting since June) of those who belonged\r\nto the 'Society for the Relief of Reduced Ladies of former Wealth and\r\nRefinement.' This 'relief' consisted in furnishing work to the\r\nrecipients of the _bounty_ at prices about one quarter less than they\r\ncould procure elsewhere, and without experiencing a sense of obligation\r\nwhich these charitable ladies managed to call forth.\r\n\r\nThere was already in the back parlor a bevy of six or eight, principally\r\nyoung, fine-looking, and admirably dressed women.\r\n\r\nArrayed in the most expensive silks, of rich colors, admirably\r\ncorresponding with the season, fitted in a mode the most faultless to\r\nthe exquisite forms of these fair creatures, or made dexterously to\r\nconceal any natural defect, they rose, they sat, they walked up and down\r\nthe room, greeting from time to time the new comers as they arrived.\r\n\r\nThe conversation turned meanwhile on the way the summer had been spent,\r\nand much delicate gossip was broached or hinted at, but not entered\r\ninto. Next the talk was about dress. The names of the several\r\nfashionable dressmakers were quoted as authority for this, and\r\ndenunciatory of that. Congratulations were exchanged: 'How charmingly\r\nyou look--how sweet that is--what a lovely bonnet!'\r\n\r\nAll this Hiram Meeker drank in with open ears and eyes, for from where\r\nhe was sitting, he could see everything that was going on, as well as\r\nhear every word.\r\n\r\nOne thing particularly impressed him. He felt that never before had he\r\nbeen in such society. The ladies of Dr. Chellis's church were\r\nintelligent, refined, and well bred, but here was TON--that\r\nunmistakable, unquestionable _ton_ which arrogates everything unto\r\nitself, claims everything, and with a certain class _is_ everything.\r\n\r\nI need not say, to a person of Hiram's keen and appreciative sense, the\r\npicture before him was most attractive. How perfect was every point in\r\nit! What minute and fastidious attention had been devoted to every\r\narticle of dress! How every article had been specially _designed_ to set\r\noff and adorn! The hat, how charming; the hair, how exquisitely coiffed;\r\nthe shawl, how magnificent; the dress how rich! The gloves, of what\r\nadmirable tint, and how neatly fitted; and how wonderfully were the\r\nwalking boots adapted to display foot and ankle! And these did not\r\ndistinguish one, but _every one_ present.\r\n\r\nI do not wonder Hiram was carried away by the spectacle. There is\r\nsomething very overpowering in such a scene. Who is sufficient to resist\r\nits seductive influences?\r\n\r\nIn the midst of what might be called a trance, when Hiram's senses were\r\nwrapt in a sort of charmed Elysium, the Rev. Augustus Myrtle entered the\r\nroom. He did not look toward Hiram, but passed directly into the back\r\nparlor. He walked along, not as if he were stepping on eggs, but very\r\nsmoothly and noiselessly, as if treading (as he was doing) on the finest\r\nof velvet carpets.\r\n\r\nInstantly what a flutter! How they ran up to him, ambitious to get the\r\nfirst salute, and to proffer the first congratulation! How gracefully\r\nthe Rev. Augustus Myrtle received each! Two or three there were (there\r\nwere reasons, doubtless) whose cheeks he kissed decorously, yet possibly\r\nwith some degree of relish. The rest had to content themselves with\r\nshaking hands. Many and various were the compliments he received. Their\r\n'delight to see him, how well he was looking,' and so forth.\r\n\r\nPresently he started to leave them.\r\n\r\n'Oh, you must not run off so soon, we shall follow you to your\r\n_sanctum_.'\r\n\r\n'An engagement,' replied Mr. Myrtle, glancing into the other room.\r\n\r\nA score of handsome eyes were turned in the direction where Hiram was\r\nseated, listening with attention, and watching everything. Discomfited\r\nby such an array, he colored, coughed, and nervously shifted his\r\nposition. Some laughed. The rest looked politely indifferent.\r\n\r\n'A connection of the Bennetts,' whispered Mrs. Myrtle, 'a fine young\r\nman, immensely rich. He is to come in future to our church.'\r\n\r\n'Ah,' 'Yes,' 'Indeed,' 'Excellent.' Such were the responses.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mr. Myrtle had greeted Hiram courteously, and invited him to\r\nhis library. This was across the hall, in a room which formed a part of\r\nthe church edifice.\r\n\r\nAs Hiram followed Mr. Myrtle out of the parlor, several of the ladies\r\ntook another look at him. They could not but remark that he was finely\r\nformed, fashionably dressed, and, thanks to Signor Alberto, of a very\r\ngraceful carriage.\r\n\r\nThe interview between Mr. Myrtle and Hiram was brief. The latter,\r\nthoroughly tutored by his cousin, was careful to say nothing about his\r\nprevious conviction and wonderful conversion, but left Mr. Myrtle, as\r\nwas very proper, to lead in the conversation. He had previously talked\r\nwith Mr. Strang, which, with the recommendation of Mrs. Bennett, left no\r\ndoubt in his mind as to Hiram's fitness to receive confirmation.\r\n\r\nIt was very hard for him to be informed that his early baptism must go\r\nfor nothing--what time his father and mother, in their ignorance and\r\nsimplicity, brought their child to present before God, and receive the\r\nbeautiful rite of the sprinkling of water.\r\n\r\nA dreadful mistake they made, since no properly consecrated hands\r\nadministered on that occasion. But nevertheless, Hiram is safe. Lucky\r\nfellow, he has discovered the mistake, and repaired it in season.\r\n\r\n'I think, Mr. Meeker, your conversations with Mr. Strang have proved\r\nvery instructive to you. Here is a work I have written, which embraces\r\nthe whole of my controversy with Mr. Howland on the true church (and\r\nthere is not salvation in any other) and the apostolic succession.\r\nHaving read and approved this,' he added with a pleasant smile, 'I will\r\nvouch for you as a good churchman.'\r\n\r\nHiram was delighted. He took the volume, and was about to express his\r\nthanks, when Mrs. Myrtle appeared at the door, which had been left open.\r\n\r\n'My dear, I regret to disturb you, but'--\r\n\r\n'I will join you at once,' said Mr. Myrtle, rising. This is Mr. Meeker,\r\na cousin of your friend Mrs. Bennett'--as if she did not know it.\r\n\r\nMrs. Myrtle bowed graciously, and said, with charming condescension:\r\n\r\n'Then it is _you_ I have heard such a good report of. You are coming to\r\nour church away from----'\r\n\r\n'Never mind from where, my dear,' said Mr, Myrtle pleasantly, and he\r\nbowed Hiram out in a manner which positively charmed our hero.\r\n\r\nThat evening Mr. Bennett told Hiram he had purchased a pew for\r\nhim--price sixteen hundred and fifty dollars.\r\n\r\n'Sixteen hundred and fifty dollars,' exclaimed the other, in amazement.\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'Why, I can't stand that. The dearest pews in Dr. Chellis's church were\r\nnot over six hundred. You are joking.'\r\n\r\n'You are an idiot,' retorted Mr. Bennett, half pettishly, half\r\nplayfully. 'Have you not placed yourself in my hands? Shall I not manage\r\nyour interests as I please? I say I want sixteen hundred and fifty\r\ndollars. I know you can draw the money without the least inconvenience.\r\nIf I thought you could not, I would advance it myself. Are you content?'\r\n\r\nHiram nodded a doubtful assent.\r\n\r\nHow fortunate,' continued Mr. Bennett, that the Winslows are going to\r\nEurope, and how lucky I got there the minute I did! Young Bishop came in\r\njust as I closed the purchase. I know what _he_ wanted it for, and I\r\nknow what _I_ wanted it for. Hiram, a word in your ear--your pew is\r\nimmediately in front of our heiress! Bravo, old fellow! Now, will you\r\npay up?'\r\n\r\nHiram nodded this time with satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe second Sunday thereafter one might observe that the Winslows' pew\r\nhad been newly cushioned and carpeted, and otherwise put in order.\r\nSeveral prayer books and a Bible, elegantly bound, and lettered 'H.\r\nMeeker,' were placed in it. This could not escape the notice of the very\r\nelegant and fashionably dressed young lady in the next slip. Strange to\r\nsay, the pew contained no occupant. But just before the service was\r\nabout to commence, Hiram, purposely a little late, walked quietly in,\r\nand took possession of his property. His _pose_ was capital. His ease\r\nand _nonchalance_ were perfectly unexceptionable, evidencing _haut ton_.\r\nHe had been practising for weeks.\r\n\r\n'Who can he be?' asked the elegant and fashionably dressed young lady of\r\nherself. She was left to wonder. When he walked homeward, Hiram was\r\ninformed by Mr. Bennett that the elegant and fashionably dressed young\r\nlady was Miss Arabella Thorne, without father, without mother, of age,\r\nand possessed of a clear sum of two hundred thousand dollars in her own\r\nright!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN FINANCES AND RESOURCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER NO. I, FROM HON. ROBERT J. WALKER.\r\n\r\nLONDON, 10 Half Moon Street, Piccadilly, _August 5, 1863_.\r\n\r\nThe question has been often asked me, here and on the continent, _how\r\nhas your Secretary of the Treasury (Mr. Chase) so marvellously sustained\r\nAmerican credit during this rebellion, and when will your finances\r\ncollapse?_ This question I have frequently answered in conversations\r\nwith European statesmen and bankers, and the discussion has closed\r\ngenerally in decided approval of Mr. Chase's financial policy, and great\r\nconfidence in the wonderful resources of the United States.\r\n\r\nThus encouraged, I have concluded to discuss the question in a series of\r\nletters, explaining Mr. Chase's system and stating the reasons of its\r\nremarkable success. The interest in such a topic is not confined to the\r\nUnited States, nor to the present period, but extends to all times and\r\nnations. Indeed, finance, as a science, belongs to the world. It is a\r\nprincipal branch of the doctrine of 'the wealth of nations,' discussed,\r\nduring the last century, with so much ability by Adam Smith. Although\r\nmany great principles were then settled, yet political economy is\r\nemphatically progressive, especially the important branches of credit,\r\ncurrency, taxation, and revenue.\r\n\r\nMr. Chase's success has been complete under the most appalling\r\ndifficulties. The preceding administration, by their treasonable course,\r\nand anti-coercion heresies, had almost paralyzed the Government. They\r\nhad increased the rate of interest of Federal loans from six to nearly\r\ntwelve per cent. per annum. Their Vice-president (Mr. Breckenridge),\r\ntheir Finance Minister (Mr. Cobb), their Secretary of War (Mr. Floyd),\r\ntheir Secretary of the Interior (Mr. Thompson), are now in the traitor\r\narmy. Even the President (Mr. Buchanan), with an evident purpose of\r\naiding the South to dissolve the Union, had announced in his messages\r\nthe absurd political paradox, that _a State has no right to secede, but\r\nthat the Government has no right to prevent its secession_. It was a\r\nconspiracy of traitors, at the head of which stood the President,\r\nsecretly pledged, at Ostend and Cininnati, to the South (as the price of\r\ntheir support), to aid them to control or destroy the republic. Thus was\r\nit that, in time of profound peace, when our United States six per\r\ncents. commanded a few weeks before a large premium, and our debt was\r\nless than $65,000,000, that Mr. Buchanan's Secretary of the Treasury\r\n(Mr. Cobb) was borrowing money at an interest of nearly twelve per cent.\r\nper annum. Most fortunately that accursed administration was drawing to\r\na close, or the temporary overthrow of the Government would have been\r\neffected. Never did any minister of finance undertake a task apparently\r\nso hopeless as that so fully accomplished by Mr. Chase in reviving the\r\npublic credit. A single fact will illustrate the extraordinary result.\r\nAt the close of the fiscal year ending 1st July, 1860, our public debt\r\nwas only $64,769,703, and Secretary Cobb was borrowing money at twelve\r\nper cent. per annum. On the first of July 1863, in the midst of a\r\nstupendous rebellion, our debt was $1,097,274,000, and Mr. Chase had\r\nreduced the average rate of interest to 3.89 per cent. per annum, whilst\r\nthe highest rate was 7.30 for a comparatively small sum to be paid off\r\nnext year. This is a financial achievement without a parallel in the\r\nhistory of the world. If I speak on this subject with some enthusiasm,\r\nit is in no egotistical spirit, for Mr. Chase's system differs in many\r\nrespects widely from that adopted by me as Minister of Finance during\r\nthe Mexican war, and which raised United States _five per cents._ to a\r\npremium. But my system was based on specie, or its real and convertible\r\nequivalent, and would not have answered the present emergency, which, by\r\nour enormous expenditure, necessarily forced a partial and temporary\r\nsuspension of specie payments upon our banks and Government. Mr. Chase's\r\nsystem is exclusively his own, and, in many of its aspects, is without a\r\nprecedent in history. When first proposed by him it had very few\r\nfriends, and was forced upon a reluctant Congress by the great\r\nemergency, presenting the alternative of its adoption or financial ruin.\r\nIndeed, upon a test vote in Congress in February last, it had failed,\r\nwhen the premium on gold rose immediately over twenty per cent. This\r\ncaused a reconsideration, when the bills were passed and the premium on\r\ngold was immediately reduced more than the previous rise, exhibiting the\r\nextraordinary difference in a few days of twenty-three per cent., in the\r\nabsence of any intermediate Federal victories in the field.\r\n\r\nSuch are the facts. Let me now proceed to detail the causes of these\r\nremarkable results. The first element in the success of any Minister of\r\nFinance is the just confidence of the country in his ability, integrity,\r\ncandor, courage, and patriotism. He may find it necessary, in some great\r\nemergency, like our rebellion, to diverge somewhat from the _via trita_\r\nof the past, and enter upon paths not lighted by the lamp of experience.\r\nHe must never, however, abandon great principles, which are as\r\nunchangeable as the laws developed by the physical sciences. When Mr.\r\nChase, in his first annual Treasury Report of the 9th of December, 1861,\r\nrecommended his system of United States banks, organized by Congress\r\nthroughout the country, furnishing a circulation based upon private\r\nmeans and credit, but secured also by an adequate amount of Federal\r\nstock, held by the Government as security for its redemption, it was\r\nvery unpopular, and encountered most violent opposition. The State\r\nbanks, and all the great interests connected with them, were arrayed\r\nagainst the proposed system. When we reflect that many of these banks\r\n(especially in the great State of New York) were based on State stocks,\r\nand in many States that the banks yielded large revenues to the local\r\nGovernment;--when we see, by our Census Tables of 1860 (p. 193), that\r\nthese banks numbered 1642, with a capital paid up of $421,890,095, loans\r\n$691,495,580, and a circulation and deposits, including specie, of\r\n$544,469,134,--we may realize in part the tremendous power arrayed\r\nagainst the Secretary. This opposition was so formidable, that neither\r\nin the public press nor in Congress did this recommendation of Mr. Chase\r\nreceive any considerable support. Speaking of the _currency_ issued by\r\nthe State banks, and of the substitute proposed by Mr. Chase, he\r\npresented the following views in his first annual Report before referred\r\nto, of December, 1861:--\r\n\r\n     'The whole of this circulation constitutes a loan without interest\r\n     from the people to the banks, costing them nothing except the\r\n     expense of issue and redemption and the interest on the specie kept\r\n     on hand for the latter purpose; and it deserves consideration\r\n     whether sound policy does not require that the advantages of this\r\n     loan be transferred in part at least, from the banks, representing\r\n     only the interests of the stockholders, to the Government,\r\n     representing the aggregate interests of the whole people.\r\n\r\n     'It has been well questioned by the most eminent statesmen whether\r\n     a currency of bank notes, issued by local institutions under State\r\n     laws, is not, in fact, prohibited by the national Constitution.\r\n     Such emissions certainly fall within the spirit, if not within the\r\n     letter, of the constitutional prohibition of the emission of bills\r\n     of credit by the States, and of the making by them of anything\r\n     except gold and silver coin a legal tender in payment of debts.\r\n     'However this may be, it is too clear to be reasonably disputed\r\n     that Congress, under its constitutional powers to lay taxes, to\r\n     regulate commerce, and to regulate the value of coin, possesses\r\n     ample authority to control the credit circulation which enters so\r\n     largely into the transactions of commerce and affects in so many\r\n     ways the value of coin.\r\n\r\n     'In the judgment of the Secretary the time has arrived when\r\n     Congress should exercise this authority. The value of the existing\r\n     bank note circulation depends on the laws of thirty-four States and\r\n     the character of some sixteen hundred private corporations. It is\r\n     usually furnished in greatest proportions by institutions of least\r\n     actual capital. Circulation, commonly, is in the inverse ratio of\r\n     solvency. Well-founded institutions, of large and solid capital,\r\n     have, in general, comparatively little circulation; while weak\r\n     corporations almost invariably seek to sustain themselves by\r\n     obtaining from the people the largest possible credit in this form.\r\n     Under such a system, or rather lack of system, great fluctuations,\r\n     and heavy losses in discounts and exchanges, are inevitable; and\r\n     not unfrequently, through failures of the issuing institutions,\r\n     considerable portions of the circulation become suddenly worthless\r\n     in the hands of the people. The recent experience of several States\r\n     in the valley of the Mississippi painfully illustrates the justice\r\n     of these observations; and enforces by the most cogent practical\r\n     arguments the duty of protecting commerce and industry against the\r\n     recurrence of such disorders.\r\n\r\n     'The Secretary thinks it possible to combine with this protection a\r\n     provision for circulation, safe to the community and convenient for\r\n     the Government.\r\n\r\n     'Two plans for effecting this object are suggested. The first\r\n     contemplates the gradual withdrawal from circulation of the notes\r\n     of private corporations and for the issue, in their stead of United\r\n     States notes, payable in coin on demand, in amounts sufficient for\r\n     the useful ends of a representative currency. The second\r\n     contemplates the preparation and delivery, to institutions and\r\n     associations, of notes prepared for circulation under national\r\n     direction, and to be secured as to prompt convertibility into coin\r\n     by the pledge of United States bonds and other needful regulations.\r\n\r\n     'The first of these plans was partially adopted at the last session\r\n     of Congress in the provision authorizing the Secretary to issue\r\n     United States notes, payable in coin, to an amount not exceeding\r\n     fifty millions of dollars. That provision may be so extended as to\r\n     reach the average circulation of the country, while a moderate tax,\r\n     gradually augmented, on bank notes, will relieve the national from\r\n     the competition of local circulation. It has been already suggested\r\n     that the substitution of a national for a State currency, upon this\r\n     plan, would be equivalent to a loan to the Government without\r\n     interest, except on the fund to be kept in coin, and without\r\n     expense, except the cost of preparation, issue, and redemption;\r\n     while the people would gain the additional advantage of a uniform\r\n     currency, and relief from a considerable burden in the form of\r\n     interest on debt. These advantages are, doubtless, considerable;\r\n     and if a scheme can be devised by which such a circulation will be\r\n     certainly and strictly confined to the real needs of the people,\r\n     and kept constantly equivalent to specie by prompt and certain\r\n     redemption in coin, it will hardly fail of legislative sanction.\r\n\r\n     'The plan, however, is not without serious inconveniences and\r\n     hazards. The temptation, especially great in times of pressure and\r\n     danger, to issue notes without adequate provision for redemption;\r\n     the ever-present liability to be called on for redemption beyond\r\n     means, however carefully provided and managed; the hazards of\r\n     panics, precipitating demands for coin, concentrated on a few\r\n     points and a single fund; the risk of a depreciated, depreciating,\r\n     and finally worthless paper money; the immeasurable evils of\r\n     dishonored public faith and national bankruptcy; all these are\r\n     possible consequence of the adoption of a system of government\r\n     circulation. It may be said, and perhaps truly, that they are less\r\n     deplorable than those of an irredeemable bank circulation. Without\r\n     entering into that comparison, the Secretary contents himself with\r\n     observing that, in his judgment, these possible disasters so far\r\n     outweigh the probable benefits of the plan that he feels himself\r\n     constrained to forbear recommending its adoption.\r\n\r\n     'The second plan suggested remains for examination. Its principal\r\n     features are, (1st) a circulation of notes bearing a common\r\n     impression and authenticated by a common authority; (2d) the\r\n     redemption of these notes by the associations and institutions to\r\n     which they may be delivered for issue; and (3d) the security of\r\n     that redemption by the pledge of the United States stocks, and an\r\n     adequate provision of specie.\r\n\r\n     'In this plan the people, in their ordinary business, would find\r\n     the advantages of uniformity in currency; of uniformity in\r\n     security; of effectual safeguard, if effectual safeguard is\r\n     possible, against depreciation; and of protection from losses in\r\n     discount and exchanges; while in the operations of the Government\r\n     the people would find the further advantage of a large demand for\r\n     Government securities, of increased facilities for obtaining the\r\n     loans required by the war, and of some alleviation of the burdens\r\n     on industry through a diminution in the rate of interest, or a\r\n     participation in the profit of circulation, without risking the\r\n     perils of a great money monopoly.\r\n\r\n     'A further and important advantage to the people may be reasonably\r\n     expected in the increased security of the Union, springing from the\r\n     common interest in its preservation, created by the distribution of\r\n     its stocks to associations throughout the country, as the basis of\r\n     their circulation.\r\n\r\n     'The Secretary entertains the opinion that if a credit circulation\r\n     in any form be desirable, it is most desirable in this. The notes\r\n     thus issued and secured would, in his judgment, form the safest\r\n     currency which this country has ever enjoyed; while their\r\n     receivability for all Government dues, except customs, would make\r\n     them, wherever payable, of equal value, as a currency, in every\r\n     part of the Union. The large amount of specie now in the United\r\n     States, reaching a total of not less than two hundred and\r\n     seventy-five millions of dollars, will easily support payments of\r\n     duties in coin, while these payments and ordinary demands will aid\r\n     in retaining this specie in the country as a solid basis both of\r\n     circulation and loans.\r\n\r\n     'The whole circulation of the country, except a limited amount of\r\n     foreign coin, would, after the lapse of two or three years, bear\r\n     the impress of the nation whether in coin or notes; while the\r\n     amount of the latter, always easily ascertainable, and, of course,\r\n     always generally known, would not be likely to be increased beyond\r\n     the real wants of business.\r\n\r\n     'He expresses an opinion in favor of this plan with the greater\r\n     confidence, because it has the advantage of recommendation from\r\n     experience. It is not an untried theory. In the State of New York,\r\n     and in one or more of the other States, it has been subjected, in\r\n     its most essential parts, to the test of experiment, and has been\r\n     found practicable and useful. The probabilities of success will not\r\n     be diminished but increased by its adoption under national sanction\r\n     and for the whole country.\r\n\r\n     'It only remains to add that the plan is recommended by one other\r\n     consideration, which, in the judgment of the Secretary, is entitled\r\n     to much influence. It avoids almost, if not altogether, the evils\r\n     of a great and sudden change in the currency by offering\r\n     inducements to solvent existing institutions to withdraw the\r\n     circulation issued under State authority, and substitute that\r\n     provided by the authority of the Union. Thus, through the voluntary\r\n     action of the existing institutions, aided by wise legislation, the\r\n     great transition from a currency heterogeneous, unequal, and\r\n     unsafe, to one uniform, equal, and safe, may be speedily and almost\r\n     imperceptibly accomplished.\r\n\r\n     'If the Secretary has omitted the discussion of the question of the\r\n     constitutional power of Congress to put this plan into operation,\r\n     it is because no argument is necessary to establish the proposition\r\n     that the power to regulate commerce and the value of coin includes\r\n     the power to regulate the currency of the country, or the\r\n     collateral proposition that the power to effect the end includes\r\n     the power to adopt the necessary and expedient means.\r\n\r\n     'The Secretary entertains the hope that the plan now submitted, if\r\n     adopted with the limitations and safeguards which the experience\r\n     and wisdom of senators and representatives will, doubtless,\r\n     suggest, may impart such value and stability to Government\r\n     securities that it will not be difficult to obtain the additional\r\n     loans required for the service of the current and the succeeding\r\n     year at fair and reasonable rates; especially if the public credit\r\n     be supported by sufficient and certain provision for the payment of\r\n     interest and ultimate redemption of the principal.'\r\n\r\nCongress adjourned after a session of eight months, and failed to adopt\r\nMr. Chase's recommendation. Indeed, it had then but few advocates in\r\nCongress or the country. Events rolled on, and our debt, as anticipated\r\nby Mr. Chase, became of vast dimensions. In his Report of December,\r\n1861, the public debt on the 30th June, 1862 (the close of the fiscal\r\nyear), was estimated by the Secretary at $517,372,800; and it was\r\n$514,211,371, or more than $3,000,000 less than the estimate. In his\r\nReport of December 4, 1862, our debt, on the 30th June, 1863, was\r\nestimated by Mr. Chase at $1,122,297,403, and it was $1,097,274,000,\r\nbeing $25,023,403 less than the estimate. The _average_ rate of interest\r\non this debt was 3.89, being $41,927,980, of which $30,141,080 was\r\npayable in gold, and $11,786,900 payable in Federal currency. It will\r\nthus be seen that the whole truth, as to our heavy debt, was always\r\ndistinctly stated in advance by Mr. Chase, and that the debt has not now\r\nquite reached his estimate. Long before the date of the second annual\r\nReport of the Secretary, the banks had suspended specie payments, and\r\nthe Secretary renewed his former recommendation on that subject in these\r\nwords:--\r\n\r\n     'While the Secretary thus repeats the preference he has heretofore\r\n     expressed for a United States note circulation, even when issued\r\n     direct by the Government, and dependent on the action of the\r\n     Government for regulation and final redemption, over the note\r\n     circulation of the numerous and variously organized and variously\r\n     responsible banks now existing in the country; and while he now\r\n     sets forth, more fully than heretofore, the grounds of that\r\n     preference, he still adheres to the opinion expressed in his last\r\n     Report, that a circulation furnished by the Government, but issued\r\n     by banking associations, organized under a general act of Congress,\r\n     is to be preferred to either. Such a circulation, uniform in\r\n     general characteristics, and amply secured as to prompt\r\n     convertibility by national bonds deposited in the treasury, by the\r\n     associations receiving it, would unite, in his judgment, more\r\n     elements of soundness and utility than can be combined in any\r\n     other.\r\n\r\n     'A circulation composed exclusively of notes issued directly by the\r\n     Government, or of such notes and coin, is recommended mainly by two\r\n     considerations:--the first derived from the facility with which it\r\n     may be provided in emergencies, and the second, from its cheapness.\r\n\r\n     'The principal objections to such a circulation as a permanent\r\n     system are, 1st, the facility of excessive expansion when\r\n     expenditures exceed revenue; 2d, the danger of lavish and corrupt\r\n     expenditure, stimulated by facility of expansion; 3d, the danger of\r\n     fraud in management and supervision; 4th, the impossibility of\r\n     providing it in sufficient amounts for the wants of the people\r\n     whenever expenditures are reduced to equality with revenue or below\r\n     it.\r\n\r\n     'These objections are all serious. The last requires some\r\n     elucidation. It will be easily understood, however, if it be\r\n     considered that a government issuing a credit circulation cannot\r\n     supply, in any given period, an amount of currency greater than the\r\n     excess of its disbursements over its receipts. To that amount, it\r\n     may create a debt in small notes, and these notes may be used as\r\n     currency. This is precisely the way in which the existing currency\r\n     of United States notes is supplied. That portion of the expenditure\r\n     not met by revenue or loans has been met by the issue of these\r\n     notes. Debt in this form has been substituted for various debts in\r\n     other forms. Whenever, therefore, the country shall be restored to\r\n     a healthy normal condition, and receipts exceed expenditures, the\r\n     supply of United States notes will be arrested, and must\r\n     progressively diminish. Whatever demand may be made for their\r\n     redemption in coin must hasten this diminution; and there can be no\r\n     reissue; for reissue, under the conditions, necessarily implies\r\n     disbursement, and the revenue, upon the supposition, supplies more\r\n     than is needed for that purpose. There is, then, no mode in which a\r\n     currency in United States notes can be permanently maintained,\r\n     except by loans of them, when not required for disbursement, on\r\n     deposits of coin, or pledge of securities, or in some other way.\r\n     This would convert the treasury into a government bank, with all\r\n     its hazards and mischiefs.\r\n\r\n     'If these reasonings be sound, little room can remain for doubt\r\n     that the evils certain to arise from such a scheme of currency, if\r\n     adopted as a permanent system, greatly overbalance the temporary\r\n     though not inconsiderable advantages offered by it.\r\n\r\n     'It remains to be considered what results may be reasonably\r\n     expected from an act authorizing the organization of banking\r\n     associations, such as the Secretary proposed in his last Report.\r\n\r\n     'The central idea of the proposed measure is the establishment of\r\n     one sound, uniform circulation, of equal value throughout the\r\n     country, upon the foundation of national credit combined with\r\n     private capital.\r\n\r\n     'Such a currency, it is believed, can be secured through banking\r\n     associations organized under national legislation.\r\n\r\n     'It is proposed that these associations be entirely voluntary. Any\r\n     persons, desirous of employing real capital in sufficient amounts,\r\n     can, if the plan be adopted, unite together under proper articles,\r\n     and having contributed the requisite capital, can invest such part\r\n     of it, not less than a fixed minimum, in United States bonds, and,\r\n     having deposited these bonds with the proper officer of the United\r\n     States, can receive United States notes in such denominations as\r\n     may be desired, and employ them as money in discounts and\r\n     exchanges. The stockholders of any existing banks can, in like\r\n     manner, organize under the act, and transfer, by such degrees as\r\n     may be found convenient, the capital of the old to the use of the\r\n     new associations. The notes thus put into circulation will be\r\n     payable, until resumption, in United States notes, and, after\r\n     resumption, in specie, by the association which issues them, on\r\n     demand; and if not so paid will be redeemable at the treasury of\r\n     the United States from the proceeds of the bonds pledged in\r\n     security. In the practical working of the plan, if sanctioned by\r\n     Congress, redemption at one or more of the great commercial\r\n     centres, will probably be provided for by all the associations\r\n     which circulate the notes, and, in case any association shall fail\r\n     in such redemption, the treasurer of the United States will\r\n     probably, under discretionary authority, pay the notes, and cancel\r\n     the public debt held as security.\r\n\r\n     'It seems difficult to conceive of a note circulation which will\r\n     combine higher local and general credit than this. After a few\r\n     years no other circulation would be used, nor could the issues of\r\n     the national circulation be easily increased beyond the legitimate\r\n     demands of business. Every dollar of circulation would represent\r\n     real capital, actually invested in national stocks, and the total\r\n     amount issued could always be easily and quickly ascertained from\r\n     the books of the treasury. These circumstances, if they might not\r\n     wholly remove the temptation to excessive issues, would certainly\r\n     reduce it to the lowest point, while the form of the notes, the\r\n     uniformity of the devices, the signatures of national officers, and\r\n     the imprint of the national seal authenticating the declaration\r\n     borne on each that it is secured by bonds which represent the faith\r\n     and capital of the whole country, could not fail to make every note\r\n     as good in any part of the world as the best known and best\r\n     esteemed national securities.\r\n\r\n     'The Secretary has already mentioned the support to public credit\r\n     which may be expected from the proposed associations. The\r\n     importance of this point may excuse some additional observations.\r\n\r\n     'The organization proposed, if sanctioned by Congress, would\r\n     require, within a very few years, for deposit as security for\r\n     circulation, bonds of the United States to an amount not less than\r\n     $250,000,000. It may well be expected, indeed, since the\r\n     circulation, by uniformity in credit and value, and capacity of\r\n     quick and cheap transportation, will be likely to be used more\r\n     extensively than any hitherto issued, that the demand for bonds\r\n     will overpass this limit. Should Congress see fit to restrict the\r\n     privilege of deposit to the bonds known as five-twenties,\r\n     authorized by the act of last session, the demand would promptly\r\n     absorb all of that description already issued and make large room\r\n     for more. A steady market for the bonds would thus be established\r\n     and the negotiation of them greatly facilitated.\r\n\r\n     'But it is not in immediate results that the value of this support\r\n     would be only or chiefly seen. There are always holders who desire\r\n     to sell securities of whatever kind. If buyers are few or\r\n     uncertain, the market value must decline. But the plan proposed\r\n     would create a constant demand, equalling and often exceeding the\r\n     supply. Thus a steady uniformity in price would be maintained, and\r\n     generally at a rate somewhat above those of bonds of equal credit,\r\n     but not available to banking associations. It is not easy to\r\n     appreciate the full benefits of such conditions to a government\r\n     obliged to borrow.\r\n\r\n     'Another advantage to be derived from such associations would be\r\n     found in the convenient agencies which they would furnish for the\r\n     deposit of public moneys.\r\n\r\n     'The Secretary does not propose to interfere with the independent\r\n     treasury. It may be advantageously retained, with the assistant\r\n     treasurers already established in the most important cities, where\r\n     the customs may be collected as now, in coin or treasury notes\r\n     issued directly by the Government, but not furnished to banking\r\n     associations.\r\n\r\n     'But whatever the advantages of such arrangements in the commercial\r\n     cities in relation to customs, it seems clear that the secured\r\n     national circulation furnished to the banking associations should\r\n     be received everywhere for all other dues than customs, and that\r\n     these associations will constitute the best and safest depositaries\r\n     of the revenues derived from such receipts. The convenience and\r\n     utility to the Government of their employment in this capacity, and\r\n     often, also, as agents for payments and as distributors of stamps,\r\n     need no demonstration. The necessity for some other depositaries\r\n     than surveyors of ports, receivers, postmasters, and other\r\n     officers, of whose responsibilities and fitness, in many cases,\r\n     nothing satisfactory can be known, is acknowledged by the provision\r\n     for selection by the Secretary contained in the internal revenue\r\n     act; and it seems very clear that the public interest will be\r\n     secured far more certainly by the organization and employment of\r\n     associations organized as proposed than by any official selection.\r\n\r\n     'Another and very important advantage of the proposed plan has\r\n     already been adverted to. It will reconcile, as far as practicable,\r\n     the interest of existing institutions with those of the whole\r\n     people.\r\n\r\n     'All changes, however important, should be introduced with caution,\r\n     and proceeded in with careful regard to every affected interest.\r\n     Rash innovation is not less dangerous than stupefied inaction. The\r\n     time has come when a circulation of United States notes, in some\r\n     form, must be employed. The people demand uniformity in currency,\r\n     and claim, at least, part of the benefit of debt without interest,\r\n     made into money, hitherto enjoyed exclusively by the banks. These\r\n     demands are just and must be respected. But there need be no sudden\r\n     change; there need be no hurtful interference with existing\r\n     interests. As yet the United States note circulation hardly fills\r\n     the vacuum caused by the temporary withdrawal of coin; it does not,\r\n     perhaps, fully meet the demand for increased circulation created by\r\n     the increased number, variety, and activity of payments in money.\r\n     There is opportunity, therefore, for the wise and beneficial\r\n     regulation of its substitution for other circulation. The mode of\r\n     substitution, also, may be judiciously adapted to actual\r\n     circumstances. The plan suggested consults both purposes. It\r\n     contemplates gradual withdrawal of bank note circulation, and\r\n     proposes a United States note circulation, furnished to banking\r\n     associations, in the advantages of which they may participate in\r\n     full proportion to the care and responsibility assumed and the\r\n     services performed by them. The promptitude and zeal with which\r\n     many of the existing institutions came to the financial support of\r\n     the Government in the dark days which followed the outbreak of the\r\n     rebellion is not forgotten. They ventured largely, and boldly, and\r\n     patriotically on the side of the Union and the constitutional\r\n     supremacy of the nation over States and citizens. It does not at\r\n     all detract from the merit of the act that the losses, which they\r\n     feared but unhesitatingly risked, were transmuted into unexpected\r\n     gains. It is a solid recommendation of the suggested plan that it\r\n     offers the opportunity to these and kindred institutions to\r\n     reorganize, continue their business under the proposed act, and\r\n     with little loss and much advantage, participate in maintaining the\r\n     new and uniform national currency.\r\n\r\n     'The proposed plan is recommended, finally, by the firm anchorage\r\n     it will supply to the union of the States. Every banking\r\n     association whose bonds are deposited in the treasury of the Union;\r\n     every individual who holds a dollar of the circulation secured by\r\n     such deposit; every merchant, every manufacturer, every farmer,\r\n     every mechanic, interested in transactions dependent for success\r\n     on the credit of that circulation, will feel as an injury every\r\n     attempt to rend the national unity, with the permanence and\r\n     stability of which all their interests are so closely and vitally\r\n     connected. Had the system been possible, and had it actually\r\n     existed two years ago, can it be doubted that the national\r\n     interests and sentiments enlisted by it for the Union would have so\r\n     strengthened the motives for adhesion derived from other sources\r\n     that the wild treason of secession would have been impossible?\r\n\r\n     'The Secretary does not yield to the phantasy that taxation is a\r\n     blessing and debt a benefit; but it is the duty of public men to\r\n     extract good from evil whenever it is possible. The burdens of\r\n     taxation may be lightened and even made productive of incidental\r\n     benefits by wise, and aggravated and made intolerable by unwise,\r\n     legislation. In like manner debt, by no means desirable in itself,\r\n     may, when circumstances compel nations to incur its obligations, be\r\n     made by discreet use less burdensome, and even instrumental in the\r\n     promotion of public and private security and welfare.\r\n\r\n     'The rebellion has brought a great debt upon us. It is proposed to\r\n     use a part of it in such a way that the sense of its burden may be\r\n     lost in the experience of incidental advantages. The issue of\r\n     United States notes is such a use; but if exclusive, is hazardous\r\n     and temporary. The security by national bonds of similar notes\r\n     furnished to banking associations is such a use, and is\r\n     comparatively safe and permanent; and with this use may be\r\n     connected, for the present, and occasionally, as circumstances may\r\n     require, hereafter, the use of the ordinary United States notes in\r\n     limited amounts.\r\n\r\n     'No very early day will probably witness the reduction of the\r\n     public debt to the amount required as a basis for secured\r\n     circulation. Should no future wars arrest reduction and again\r\n     demand expenditures beyond revenue, that day will, however, at\r\n     length come. When it shall arrive the debt may be retained on low\r\n     interest at that amount, or some other security for circulation may\r\n     be devised, or, possibly, the vast supplies of our rich mines may\r\n     render all circulation unadvisable except gold and the absolute\r\n     representatives and equivalents, dollar for dollar, of gold in the\r\n     treasury or on safe deposit elsewhere. But these considerations may\r\n     be for another generation.\r\n\r\n     'The Secretary forbears extended argument on the constitutionality\r\n     of the suggested system. It is proposed as an auxiliary to the\r\n     power to borrow money; as an agency of the power to collect and\r\n     disburse taxes; and as an exercise of the power to regulate\r\n     commerce, and of the power to regulate the value of coin. Of the\r\n     two first sources of power nothing need be said. The argument\r\n     relating to them was long since exhausted, and is well known. Of\r\n     the other two there is not room, nor does it seem needful to say\r\n     much. If Congress can prescribe the structure, equipment, and\r\n     management of vessels to navigate rivers flowing between or through\r\n     different States as a regulation of commerce, Congress may\r\n     assuredly determine what currency shall be employed in the\r\n     interchange of their commodities, which is the very essence of\r\n     commerce. Statesmen who have agreed in little else have concurred\r\n     in the opinion that the power to regulate coin is, in substance and\r\n     effect, a power to regulate currency, and that the framers of the\r\n     Constitution so intended. It may well enough be admitted that while\r\n     Congress confines its regulation to weight, fineness, shape, and\r\n     device, banks and individuals may issue notes for currency in\r\n     competition with coin. But it is difficult to conceive by what\r\n     process of logic the unquestioned power to regulate coin can be\r\n     separated from the power to maintain or restore its circulation, by\r\n     excluding from currency all private or corporate substitutes which\r\n     affect its value, whenever Congress shall see fit to exercise that\r\n     power for that purpose.\r\n\r\n     'The recommendations, now submitted, of the limited issue of United\r\n     States notes as a wise expedient for the present time, and as an\r\n     occasional expedient for future times, and of the organization of\r\n     banking associations to supply circulation secured by national\r\n     bonds and convertible always into United States notes, and after\r\n     resumption of specie payments, into coin, are prompted by no favor\r\n     to excessive issues of any description of credit money.\r\n\r\n     'On the contrary, it is the Secretary's firm belief that by no\r\n     other path can the resumption of specie payments be so surely\r\n     reached and so certainly maintained. United States notes receivable\r\n     for bonds bearing a secure specie interest are next best to notes\r\n     convertible into coin. The circulation of banking associations\r\n     organized under a general act of Congress, secured by such bonds,\r\n     can be most surely and safely maintained at the point of certain\r\n     convertibility into coin. If, temporarily, these associations\r\n     redeem their issues with United States notes, resumption of specie\r\n     payments will not thereby be delayed or endangered, but hastened\r\n     and secured; for, just as soon as victory shall restore peace, the\r\n     ample revenue, already secured by wise legislation, will enable the\r\n     Government, through advantageous purchases of specie, to replace at\r\n     once large amounts, and, at no distant day, the whole, of this\r\n     circulation by coin, without detriment to any interest, but, on the\r\n     contrary, with great and manifest benefit to all interests.\r\n\r\n     'The Secretary recommends, therefore, no mere paper money scheme,\r\n     but, on the contrary, a series of measures looking to a safe and\r\n     gradual return to gold and silver as the only permanent basis,\r\n     standard, and measure of values recognized by the\r\n     Constitution--between which and an irredeemable paper currency, as\r\n     he believes, the choice is now to be made.'\r\n\r\nCongress, however, was still unwilling to adopt the recommendations of\r\nthe Secretary, until the necessity was demonstrated by the course of\r\nevents. On reference to the laws, which are printed in the Appendix, it\r\nwill be found, that the great features of the system of the Secretary\r\nwere as follows:\r\n\r\n1. A loan to the Government upon its bonds reimbursable in twenty years,\r\nbut redeemable after five years, at the option of the nation, the\r\ninterest being six per cent., payable semi-annually in _coin_, as is\r\nalso the principal.\r\n\r\n2. The issue of United States legal tender notes, receivable for all\r\ndues to the nation except customs, and fundable in this United States\r\n5--20 six per cent. stock.\r\n\r\n3. The authorization of the banks recommended in his Report, whose\r\ncirculation would be secured not only by private capital, but by\r\nadequate deposits of United States stock with the Government.\r\n\r\n4. To maintain, in the meantime, as near to specie as practicable, this\r\nFederal Currency,--1st, by making it receivable in all dues to the\r\nGovernment except for customs; 2d, by the privilege of funding it in\r\nUnited States stock; 3d, by enhancing the benefit of this privilege, not\r\nonly by making the stock, both principal and interest, payable in\r\nspecie, but by making it gradually the ultimate basis of our whole bank\r\ncirculation, which, as shown by the census tables before referred to\r\n(including deposits), nearly doubles every decade.\r\n\r\n5. By imposing such a tax on the circulation of the State banks, as,\r\ntogether with State or municipal taxes, would induce them to transfer\r\ntheir capital to the new banks proposed by the Secretary.\r\n\r\n6. To relieve the _new banks_ from all State or municipal taxation.\r\n\r\n7. In lieu thereof, to impose a moderate Federal tax on all bank\r\ncirculation, as a bonus to be paid cheerfully by these banks for the\r\ngreat privilege of furnishing ultimately the whole paper currency of the\r\ncountry, and the other advantages secured by these bills.\r\n\r\nThis tax, as proposed by the Secretary, was one per cent. semi-annually,\r\nwhich _in effect_ would have reduced the interest on our principal loans\r\nfrom six to four per cent. per annum, so far as those loans were made\r\nthe basis of bank circulation. Congress, however, fixed this tax at\r\nabout one half, thus making the interest on such loans equivalent in\r\nfact to five per cent. per annum, so far as such loans, at the option of\r\nthe holder, are made the basis of banking and of bank circulation. This\r\nis a privilege which gives great additional value to these loans, for\r\nthe right to issue the bank paper circulation of the country free from\r\nState or municipal taxes, is worth far more than one half per cent,\r\nsemi-annually, to be paid on such circulation. That this privilege is\r\nworth more than the Federal tax, is proved by the fact, that many banks\r\nare already being organized under this system, and by the further fact,\r\nthat more than $200,000,000 of legal tenders have already been funded in\r\nthis stock, and the process continues at the rate of from one to two\r\nmillions of dollars a day. It will be observed, that the holders of such\r\nbonds can keep them, _if they please_, disconnected with all banks,\r\nreceiving the principal at maturity, as well as the semi-annual\r\ninterest, in gold, free from all taxes.\r\n\r\nThis system has been attended with complete success, and notwithstanding\r\nthe increase of our debt, the premium on gold, for our Federal currency,\r\nfundable in this stock, has fallen from 73 per cent. in February last,\r\nbefore the adoption of Mr. Chase's system, to 27 per cent. at present;\r\nand before the 30th of June next, it is not doubted that this premium\r\nmust disappear. No loyal American doubts the complete suppression of the\r\nrebellion before that date, in which event, our Federal currency will\r\nrise at once to the par of gold. In the meantime, however, gold is at a\r\npremium of 27 per cent., which is the least profit (independent of\r\nfuture advance above par) so soon to be realized by those purchasing\r\nthis currency now, and waiting its appreciation, or investing it in our\r\nUnited States 5--20 six per cent. stock.\r\n\r\nBut, besides the financial benefits to the Government of Mr. Chase's\r\nsystem, its other advantages are great indeed. It will ultimately\r\ndisplace our whole State bank system and circulation, and give us a\r\n_national currency_, based on ample private capital and Federal stocks,\r\na currency of _uniform_ value throughout the country, and always\r\ncertainly convertible on demand into coin. Besides, by displacing the\r\nState bank circulation, the whole bank note currency of the Union will\r\nbe based on the stocks of the Government, and give to every citizen who\r\nholds the bonds or the currency (which will embrace the whole community\r\nin every State), a direct interest in the maintenance of the Union.\r\n\r\nThe annual losses which our people sustain under the separate State bank\r\nsystem, in the rate of exchange, is enormous, whilst the constant and\r\never-recurring insolvency of so many of these institutions, accompanied\r\nby eight general bank suspensions of specie payment, have, from time to\r\ntime, spread ruin and devastation throughout the country. I believe\r\nthat, in a period of twenty years, the saving to the people of the\r\nUnited States, by the substitution of the new system, would reach a sum\r\nvery nearly approaching the total amount of our public debt, and in time\r\nlargely exceeding it. As a question, then, of national wealth, as well\r\nas national unity, I believe the gain to the country in time by the\r\nadoption of the new system, will far exceed the cost of the war. It was\r\nthe State bank system in the rebel States that furnished to secession\r\nmainly the sinews of war. These banks are now generally insolvent, but,\r\nif the banking system now proposed had been in existence, and the\r\ncirculating medium in all the States had been an uniform national\r\ncurrency based entirely on the stocks of the United States, the\r\nrebellion could never have occurred. Every bank, and all its\r\nstockholders, and all the holders of the stock and notes of all the\r\nbanks, embracing our whole paper currency, would have been united to the\r\nGovernment by an interest so direct and universal, that rebellion would\r\nhave been impossible. Hamilton and Madison, Story and Marshall, and the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States, have declared that to the Federal\r\nGovernment belongs the 'entire regulation of the currency of the\r\ncountry.' That power they have now exercised in the adoption of the\r\nsystem recommended by the Secretary. Our whole currency, in coin as well\r\nas paper, will soon, now, all be national, which is the most important\r\nmeasure for the security and perpetuity of the Union, and the welfare of\r\nthe people, ever adopted by Congress. It is to Congress that the\r\nConstitution grants the exclusive power 'to regulate commerce with\r\nforeign nations and among the States;' and a sound, uniform currency, in\r\ncoin, or convertible on demand into coin, is one of the most essential\r\ninstrumentalities connected with trade and exchanges.\r\n\r\nAfter these preliminary remarks, I shall proceed with the discussion of\r\nthe subject in my next letter.\r\n\r\nR.J. WALKER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOICELESS SINGERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A bird is singing in the leaves\r\n    That quiver on yon linden tree;\r\n  So soft and clear the song he sings,\r\n    The roses listen dreamily.\r\n\r\n  The crimson buds in clusters cling;\r\n    The full, sweet roses blush with bloom;\r\n  And, white as ocean's swaying foam,\r\n    The lily trembles from the gloom.\r\n\r\n  I know not why that happy strain\r\n    That dies so softly on the air,\r\n  That perfect utterance of joy,\r\n    Has left a strange, dim sadness there.\r\n\r\n  Perchance the song, so silver-sweet,\r\n    The roses' regal blossoms shrine:\r\n  Perchance the bending lily droops,\r\n    And trembles, 'neath its thrill divine.\r\n\r\n  It may be that all beauteous things,\r\n    Though lacking music's perfect key,\r\n  Have with their inmost being twined\r\n    The hidden chords of melody.\r\n\r\n  So pine they all, to hear again\r\n    The song they know, but cannot sing;\r\n  The living utterance, full and clear,\r\n    Whose voiceless breathings round them cling.\r\n\r\n  Yet still those accents waken not;\r\n    The bird has left the linden tree;\r\n  A summer silence falls once more\r\n    Upon the listening rose and me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA DETECTIVE'S STORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following is a true story, by a late well-known member of the\r\nDetective service, and, with, the exception of some names of persons and\r\nplaces, is given precisely as he himself related it.\r\n\r\nLate one Friday afternoon, in the latter part of November, 18--, I was\r\nsent for by the chief of the New York Police, and was told there was a\r\ncase for me. It was a counterfeiting affair. Notes had been forged on a\r\nPennsylvania bank; two men had been apprehended, and were in custody.\r\nThe first, Springer, had turned State's evidence on his accomplice; who,\r\naccording to his account, was the prime mover in the business. This man,\r\nDaniel Hawes by name, had transferred the notes to a third party, of\r\nwhom nothing had been ascertained except that he was a young man, wrote\r\na beautiful hand, and had been in town the Monday before. He was the man\r\nI was to catch.\r\n\r\nIt was sundown when I left the superintendent's office. I had not much\r\nto guide me: there were hundreds of young men who wrote a beautiful\r\nhand, and had been in town last Monday. But I did not trouble myself\r\nabout what I did not know: I confined myself to what I did know. Upon\r\nreflection I thought it probable that _my man_ had been in intimate\r\nrelations with Hawes for the last few days, probably since Monday last,\r\nalthough it was not known that he had been in town since that day. He\r\nmight not be a resident in the city; but I decided to seek him\r\nhere--since, if he had not left town before the arrest of Springer and\r\nHawes, he would not just now run the risk of falling into the hands of\r\nthe police by going to any railroad station or steamer wharf.\r\n\r\nI determined, therefore, to follow up the track of Hawes, and thereby,\r\nif possible, strike that of his confederate--which was, in fact, all\r\nthat could be done.\r\n\r\nHawes was a small broker. He lived in Eighteenth street, and had an\r\noffice in Wall street.\r\n\r\nHe lived too far up town, I thought, to go home every day to his dinner;\r\nhe went then, most probably, always to the same eating house, and one\r\nnot far from his office.\r\n\r\nAfter inquiring at several restaurants near by, I came to one in Liberty\r\nstreet, where, on asking if Mr. Hawes was in the habit of dining there,\r\nthe waiter said yes.\r\n\r\n'Have you seen a young man here with him, lately?' I inquired.\r\n\r\n'No--no one in particular,' replied the waiter.\r\n\r\n'Are you sure of it? Come, think.'\r\n\r\nAfter scratching his head for a moment, he said:\r\n\r\n'Yes, there has been a young man here speaking to him once or twice.'\r\n\r\n'How did he look?'\r\n\r\n'He was short, and had black hair and eyes.'\r\n\r\n'Who is he? What does he do?'\r\n\r\n'He is clerk to Mr. L----, the linen importer.'\r\n\r\n'Where does Mr. L---- live?'\r\n\r\nThe waiter did not know. Looking into a Directory, I ascertained his\r\nresidence to be in Fourteenth street. The stores by this time were\r\nclosed, so I went immediately to Mr. L----'s house, and asked to see\r\nhim. He was at dinner.\r\n\r\n'I am sorry to disturb him,' said I to the servant, 'but I wish to speak\r\nwith him a moment on a matter of importance, and cannot wait.'\r\n\r\nMr. L---- came out, evidently annoyed at the intrusion.\r\n\r\n'Have you such a person in your employment?' said I, describing him.\r\n\r\n'No, sir, I have not.'\r\n\r\n'You had such a person?'\r\n\r\n'I have not now.'\r\n\r\n'Did you discharge him?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'Why?'\r\n\r\n'What business is that of your's?' he asked, rather huffily.\r\n\r\n'My name, sir, is M----, of the police. I am after this fellow, that's\r\nall. Tell me, if you please, why you discharged him?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I beg your pardon,' said Mr. L----. 'I took you for one of his\r\nrascally associates. I discharged him a week or ten days ago. He was a\r\ndissipated, good-for-nothing fellow.'\r\n\r\n'Was he your bookkeeper?'\r\n\r\n'No, he was a junior clerk.'\r\n\r\n'Have you any of his handwriting that you can show me?'\r\n\r\nHe fumbled in a side pocket and drew out a pocketbook from which he took\r\na memorandum of agreement, or some paper of the sort, to the bottom of\r\nwhich a signature was attached as witness.\r\n\r\n'That's his writing,' said he.\r\n\r\nIt was a stiff schoolboy's scrawl.\r\n\r\nThis was not my man then. I apologized to Mr. L---- for the trouble I\r\nhad given him, and withdrew.\r\n\r\nLost time, said I to myself. I am on the wrong track. I must back to the\r\neating house, and begin the chase again from the point where I left off.\r\nI saw the same waiter.\r\n\r\n'I want you to think again,' said I, 'Try hard to remember whether there\r\nwas never any other man here with Hawes on any occasion.'\r\n\r\nAfter reflecting for a little while, he said he thought he recollected\r\nhis going up stairs not long ago, with another man, to a private room.\r\n\r\n'Did you wait on him yourself at the time you speak of?' I asked.\r\n\r\n'No--most likely it was Joe Harris.'\r\n\r\n'Will you send for him, if you please.'\r\n\r\nJoe Harris came.\r\n\r\n'You waited on Mr. Hawes a few days ago, when he dined with another\r\ngentleman in a private room up stairs, didn't you?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Who was that other man?'\r\n\r\n'He is a young man who is clerk in a livery stable in Sullivan street.'\r\n\r\n'What are his looks?'\r\n\r\n'He is tall and light haired.'\r\n\r\n'Do you know his name?'\r\n\r\n'His name is Edgar.'\r\n\r\nI hurried up to Sullivan street, went into the first livery stable I\r\ncame to, inquired for the proprietor, and asked him if he had a young\r\nman in his stable of the name of Edgar.\r\n\r\nHe said he had.\r\n\r\n'Does he keep your books?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, he takes orders for me.'\r\n\r\n'Let me see some of his handwriting, if you please.'\r\n\r\nHe stepped back into the office and took from a desk a little order\r\nbook. I opened it: there were some orders, hastily written, no doubt,\r\nbut in a hand almost like beautiful copperplate.\r\n\r\nThis was my man--I felt nearly certain of it. I asked where he lived,\r\nand was told, with his mother, a widow woman, at such a number in Hudson\r\nstreet. I started for the place. It was now nine o'clock. Arriving at\r\nthe house, I rang the bell. It was answered by a servant girl.\r\n\r\n'Does Mr. Edgar live here?' I inquired.\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Is he at home?'\r\n\r\n'No, sir.'\r\n\r\n'When will he come home?'\r\n\r\n'I don't know.'\r\n\r\n'Does he sleep here?'\r\n\r\n'Sometimes he does, and sometimes he doesn't.'\r\n\r\n'Where is he likely to be found? I should like to see him.'\r\n\r\nShe said she really didn't know, unless perhaps he might be at a\r\nbilliard saloon not far off. I went there. A noisy crowd was around the\r\nbar. I looked around the room and closely scrutinized every face. No\r\ntall, light-haired young man was there. I asked the barkeeper if Mr.\r\nEdgar had been there that evening. He said no, he had not seen anything\r\nof him for two or three days, I asked him if there was any other place\r\nhe knew of that Edgar frequented, and was told he went a good deal to a\r\nbowling alley in West Broadway near Duane street. Not much yet, I\r\nthought, as I hurried on to West Broadway. Descending a few steps into a\r\nbasement, I entered a sort of vestibule or office to the bowling saloon.\r\n'Has Mr. Edgar been here this evening?' I inquired of the man in\r\nattendance.\r\n\r\n'He is here now,' was the reply, 'in the other room, through that door.'\r\n\r\nI passed through the door indicated into the bowling alley, and accosted\r\nthe marker:\r\n\r\n'Is Mr. Edgar here?'\r\n\r\n'He has just gone--fifteen minutes ago.'\r\n\r\n'Do you know where he went to?'\r\n\r\n'Seems to me some of them said something about going to the Lafayette\r\nTheatre.'\r\n\r\nI am on his track now--I said to myself--only fifteen minutes behind\r\nhim. I bent my steps to the theatre--taking with, me a comrade in the\r\npolice service, whom I had encountered as I was leaving the saloon. We\r\nhurried on with the utmost rapidity, but on reaching the theatre, found,\r\nto my disgust, what I had already feared, that the play was over, and\r\nthe theatre just closed.\r\n\r\n'Better give it up for to-night,' said my companion; 'we know enough\r\nabout him now, and can take up the search again to-morrow.'\r\n\r\n'It won't do, Clarke,' said I, 'we have inquired for him at too many\r\nplaces. Stay, I've a notion he may be heard of at some of these oyster\r\ncellars hereabouts.'\r\n\r\nI went down into one of them, and asked if a tall young man with light\r\nhair had been there that evening. A tall young man with light hair and\r\nmustache had come in from the theatre with a lady, and had just left. I\r\nasked my informant if he knew the lady. She was a Miss Kearney, he\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\n'What?' I continued, 'didn't her sister marry the actor Levison?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, the same person.'\r\n\r\n'He lives in Walker street, near the Bowery, I believe?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I think so,' replied the man.\r\n\r\nI considered a moment. Of course no one could tell me where Edgar had\r\ngone to; but I was tolerably certain he had gone home with the girl.\r\nWhere she lived I did not know, but I thought it probable the actor\r\ncould tell me. So we started on to Walker street. There are--or were at\r\nthe time I speak of--several boarding houses in Walker street. We passed\r\none or two three-story houses with marble steps. 'Shall I ask along\r\nhere?' said Clarke. 'No,' I answered; 'poor actors don't board there; we\r\nmust look for him farther on.' We kept on, and after a little while, we\r\nfound one that seemed to me to be likely to be the house we were looking\r\nfor. I rang the bell and inquired for Mr. Levison. He was gone to bed.\r\nIt was now twelve o'clock. I desired the man that opened the door to\r\ntell him that some one was below who wished to see him immediately. He\r\nsoon returned, saying that Mr. Levison was in bed, and could not be\r\ndisturbed: I must leave my business, or call again next day.\r\n\r\nI thought it necessary to frighten him a little; so I sent up word that\r\nI was an officer of police, and he must come down instantly, or I should\r\ngo up and fetch him. In a few moments the actor made his appearance,\r\nterribly frightened. Before I could say anything he began to pour out\r\nsuch a flood of questions and asseverations that I could not get a word\r\nin: What did I want with him? I had come to the wrong man; he hadn't\r\nbeen doing anything, etc., etc. 'I don't want you,' I began--but it was\r\nof no use, I could not stop him; his character was excellent, anybody\r\nwould vouch for him; I ought to be more sure what I was about before I\r\nroused people from their beds at midnight, etc., etc. His huddled words\r\nand apprehensive looks made me suspect there was something wrong with\r\nhim; but it was no concern of mine then. I seized him by the shoulder,\r\nand ordered him to be quiet.\r\n\r\n'Don't utter another word,' said I, 'except to answer my questions, or\r\nI'll carry you off and lock you up. I have not come to arrest you. I\r\nonly want to ask you a few questions. Haven't you a sister-in-law named\r\nMiss Kearney?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, what do you want with her?'\r\n\r\n'I am not going to do her any harm. I only want to know where she\r\nlives.'\r\n\r\n'Oh I she lives in ---- street.'\r\n\r\n'Do you know the number?'\r\n\r\n'Goodness, yes; it is number 34. I have boarded there myself until only\r\na little while ago.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed!'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I have got a dead-latch key somewhere about.'\r\n\r\n'The deuce you have! Give it to me; it is just what I want.'\r\n\r\n'Give you a dead-latch key! a pretty notion!'\r\n\r\n'I wouldn't give it to any man--not to all the detective squad in New\r\nYork.'\r\n\r\n'Look here, my friend, I am M----, pretty well known in this town. I\r\nhave a good many opportunities in the course of my business to do people\r\ngood turns, and not a few to do them ill turns. It is a convenient\r\nvocation to pay off scores, particularly to persons of your sort. If you\r\nwill give me that key, I'll make it worth your while the first chance I\r\nhave. If you don't, you'll be sorry; that's all.\"\r\n\r\nI gave him a significant look as I concluded. He looked me in the face a\r\nminute--as if to see how much I meant, or if I suspected anything; then\r\nturned and ran up stairs. In a few moments he came down, and handed me\r\nthe key. I took it with satisfaction.\r\n\r\n'Now,' said I, 'you'll have no objections to telling me where your\r\nsister-in-law's room in the house is.'\r\n\r\n'Third story, back room, second door to the left from the head of the\r\nstairs.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you, good night.'\r\n\r\nWe walked rapidly to ---- street, and reaching the house, I stopped a\r\nmoment to examine my pistols, by the street lamp, and then softly opened\r\nthe door. Clarke and I stepped in, and I shut the door.\r\n\r\nLeaving my comrade in the hall, I crept noiselessly up stairs, and\r\ntapped at the door of the room.\r\n\r\n'Who is there?' called out a woman's voice. 'Open the door,' I replied,\r\n'and I'll tell you what I want.'\r\n\r\n'You can't come in. I have gone to bed.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, well, I am a married man; I'll do you no harm; but you must let me\r\nin, or I shall force the door.'\r\n\r\nAfter a moment's delay the door was opened by a young woman in a morning\r\nwrapper, who stood as if awaiting an explanation of the intrusion. I\r\npassed by her, and walked up to a young man sitting in a low chair by\r\nthe fire, and tapping him on the shoulder, said: 'You are my prisoner.'\r\nHe raised his head and looked up. 'Why, Bill,' I exclaimed, 'is this\r\nyou? I have been looking for you all night under a wrong name. If I had\r\nknown it was you, I'd have caught you in an hour.' And so I would.\r\n\r\nIt is only necessary to say further, that he was the man I was set to\r\ncatch. I may add, however, that a large amount of the counterfeit notes,\r\nand the plates on which they were printed, were secured, and the\r\ncriminal sent to Sing Sing in due course of law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERARY NOTICES.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLOWER FOR THE PARLOUR AND GARDEN. By EDWARD SPRAGUE RAND, jr. Boston:\r\nJ.E. Tilton & Co. Price $2.50.\r\n\r\nJ.E. Tilton & Co. are the publishers of the series of photographic and\r\nlithographic cards of flowers, leaves, mosses, butterflies,\r\nhummingbirds, &c., noted for their beauty of execution. 'Flowers are so\r\nuniversally loved, and accepted everywhere as necessities of the moral\r\nlife, that whatever can be done to render their cultivation easy, and\r\nto bring them to perfection in the vicinity of, or within, the\r\nhousehold, must be regarded as a benefaction.' This benefit our author\r\nhas certainly conferred upon us. The gift is from one who must himself\r\nhave loved these lily cups and floral bells of perfume, and will be\r\nwarmly welcomed by all who prize their loveliness. In the pages of this\r\nbook may be found accurate and detailed information on all subjects\r\nlikely to be of interest to their cultivators. We give a list of the\r\ncontents of its chapters, to show how wide a field it covers. Chap. I.\r\nThe Green-House and Conservatory. Chap. II. Window Gardening. Chap.\r\nIII, IV, V, VI.

It is a real\r\npleasure to turn over its attractive leaves with the names of loved old\r\nflower-friends greeting us on every page, and new claimants with new\r\nhopes and types of beauty constantly starting up before us. What with\r\nWaltonian cases, hanging baskets, Wardian cases, &c., our ladies may\r\nadorn their parlors with _artistic_ taste with these fragrant, fragile,\r\nrainbow-hued children of Nature.\r\n\r\n  'Bright gems of earth, in which perchance we see\r\n  \"What Eden was, what Paradise may be.'\r\n\r\n'From the contemplation of nature's beauty there is but the uplifting of\r\nthe eye to the footstool of the Creator.'\r\n\r\n\r\nHOSPITAL TRANSPORTS. A Memoir of the Embarkation of the Sick and\r\nWounded from the Peninsula of Virginia in the Summer of 1862. Compiled\r\nand published at the request of the Sanitary Commission. Boston:\r\nTicknor & Fields. For sale by D. Appleton & Co., New York.\r\n\r\nA book which should be in the hands of all who love their country. The\r\nSanitary Commission deserve the undying gratitude of the nation. Their\r\norganization is one of pure benevolence; the men and women working\r\neffectively through its beneficent channel have given evidence of some\r\nof the noblest and divinest attributes of the human soul. It is\r\ndifficult to form any idea of the magnitude and importance of the work\r\nthe commission has achieved. 'Never till every soldier whose last\r\nmoments it has soothed, till every soldier whose flickering life it has\r\ngently steadied into continuance, whose waning reason it has softly\r\nlulled into quiet, whose chilled blood it has warmed into healthful\r\nplay, whose failing frame it has nourished into strength, whose fainting\r\nheart it has comforted with sympathy,--never, until every full soul has\r\npoured out its story of gratitude and thanksgiving, will the record be\r\ncomplete; but long before that time, ever since the moment that its\r\nhelping hand was first held forth, comes the Blessed Voice: 'Inasmuch as\r\nye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done\r\nit unto me.''\r\n\r\n'The blessings of thousands who were ready to perish, and tens of\r\nthousands who love their country and their kind, rest upon those who\r\noriginated, and those who sustain this noble work.'\r\n\r\nThis book is full of vivid interest, of true incident, of graphic\r\nsketches, of loyalty, patriotism, and self-abnegation, whether of men or\r\nof noble women, and recommends itself to all who love and would fain\r\nsuccor the human race.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUSTIN ELLIOT. BY HENRY KINGSLEY, Author of Ravenshoe, etc.\r\nBoston: Ticknor & Fields. For sale by D. Appleton & Co. New York.\r\n\r\nA graphic novel of considerable ability, and more than usual interest.\r\nThe tone is highly moral throughout. The lessons on duelling are\r\nexcellent. Would that our young men would lay them to heart! The\r\ncharacters are, many of them, well drawn and sustained--we confess to a\r\nsincere affection for the Highlander, Gil Macdonald, and the Scotch\r\nsheep-dog, Robin. Many of the scenes in which they appear are full of\r\nsimple and natural pathos.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUSBAND AND WIFE; or, The Science of Human Development through\r\nInherited Tendencies. By the Author of the Parent's Guide, etc.\r\nCarleton, publisher, 413 Broadway, New York.\r\n\r\nA suggestive book on an important subject. The writer assumes that\r\n'there are _laws_ of hereditary transmission in the mental and moral, as\r\nwell as the physical constitution. Precisely what these laws are, she\r\ndoes not assume to state. Such as are well known will however be helpful\r\nto all, and will facilitate the discovery of those yet hidden from us.\r\nWomen, who bear such an important part in parentage, should be the most\r\nclear-sighted students of nature in these things. It is to woman that\r\nhumanity must look for the abatement of many frightful evils,\r\nmalformation, idiocy, insanity, &c., yet the principles pertaining to\r\nthe knowledge of her own duties and powers, which ought to be a part of\r\nthe instruction of every woman, are rarely placed before her. Much that\r\npertains to the same phenomena among the lower animals may properly\r\nconstitute a part of her studies in natural history; but with the laws\r\nwhich govern the most momentous of all social effects--the moral and\r\nmental constitution of individuals composing society--with the gravest\r\nof possible results to herself--the embodiment of power and weakness,\r\ncapacity or incapacity, worth or worthlessness in her own offspring, she\r\nis forbidden all acquaintance. Yet when she assumes the duties and\r\nresponsibilities of maternity, such knowledge would be more valuable to\r\nher and to those dearest to her, than all of the treasures of the\r\ngold-bearing lands, if poured at her feet.'\r\n\r\nThe laws of hereditary transmission make the staple of this book. It is\r\nwritten by a lady, and will commend itself to all interested in this\r\nsubject. Pearl, in the Scarlet Letter, and Elsie Venner, are artistic\r\nexemplifications of such disregarded truths.\r\n\r\n\r\nVICTOR HUGO, by a Witness of his Life: Madame HUGO.\r\nTranslated from the French, by CHARLES EDWIN WILBOUR,\r\ntranslator of 'Les Miserables.' Carleton, publisher, 413 Broadway, New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nA biography of a remarkable man, written by a constant observer of his\r\nactions, almost a second self, can scarcely fail to prove interesting.\r\nIn this case the interest is increased by its close connection with a\r\npopular novel. Indeed, the readers of 'Les Miserables' will be\r\nastonished to find what a flood of light is thrown upon that master work\r\nby this charming life-history of its author. Marius is but a free\r\nvariation of Victor Hugo himself. In Joly, the old school-mate of the\r\nPension Cordier, the author of Jean Valjean becomes closely acquainted\r\nwith a real galley slave. In short, the great romance is a part of the\r\nlife of Victor Hugo, and cannot be fully understood without the\r\nbiography--its completion.'\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE AND TIMES OF SIR WILLIAM JOHNSON, BARONET.\r\n\r\nJ. MUNSELL, 78 State street, Albany, announces for publication\r\nby subscription, 'The Life and Times of Sir William Johnson, Baronet.'\r\nThe work is by William L. Stone, son of Colonel Stone, well known as\r\neditor and biographer. The materials of this Life were derived from\r\noriginal papers furnished by the family of Sir William, from his own\r\ndiary, and other sources which have never before been consulted. The\r\nwork was begun by the late William L. Stone, has been completed by his\r\nson, and with the Lives of Brant and Red Jacket, brings down the history\r\nof the Six Nations and their relations with Great Britain, from 1560 to\r\n1824. The edition will be very nearly confined to the number subscribed\r\nfor. Price $5, payable on delivery.\r\n\r\nSir William Johnson was Superintendent of Indian Affairs in this country\r\nbefore the Revolution, was distinguished in Colonial history, and active\r\nin the French and Indian war. His life was one of romantic interest and\r\nvicissitude. The work is highly spoken of by the literati who have seen\r\nthe advance sheets. Jared Sparks, George Bancroft, F. Parkman, G.W.\r\nCurtis, Lewis Cass, &c., testify to its interest and historical\r\naccuracy. From the well-known ability of its author, it may be safely\r\nand highly commended to the reading and thinking public.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEYOND THE LINES; or, a Yankee Prisoner Loose in Dixie. By Captain J.J.\r\nGeer, late of General Buckland's Staff. Philadelphia: J.W. Daughaday,\r\npublisher, 1308 Chestnut street.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN JOHN J. GEER was, before the war, a minister of the Methodist\r\nChurch in Ohio, was taken prisoner before the battle of Shiloh, in a\r\nskirmish with Beauregard's pickets, passed some months in rebel\r\nprisons, made his escape, and pleasantly tells the story of his\r\nadventures. He reports that the large slave-holders and the wretched\r\nclay-eaters are all Secessionists, but that a large middle class,\r\npeople who own but few slaves and till their own fields, are mostly\r\ntrue to the Union, in the parts of the South he visited. The book is\r\none of incident, contains many curious pictures of life and character,\r\nand will address itself to a large class of readers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AMBER GODS, AND OTHER STORIES. By Harriet Elizabeth Prescott.\r\nTicknor & Fields, Boston. For sale by D. Appleton & Co., New York.\r\n\r\nThe many readers of Miss Prescott will be glad to welcome the present\r\ncollection of her very popular tales. It contains: The Amber Gods. In a\r\nCellar. Knitting Sale-Socks. Circumstance. Desert Lands. Midsummer and\r\nMay. The South Breaker.\r\n\r\nFew writers have attained distinction and recognition so immediately as\r\nMiss Prescott. Her fancy is brilliant, her style glowing, and culture\r\nand varied information mark the products of her pen.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE; a Dramatic Romance. Ticknor & Fields, Boston. For\r\nsale by D. Appleton & Co., New York.\r\n\r\nAn historical romance, cast in a dramatic and rhythmical form, by Henry\r\nTaylor. It has been too long known to the community to require any\r\ncommendation at the present date. It has gone through many editions in\r\nEngland. We are glad to see it in the convenient and pleasant form of\r\nTicknor's \"Blue and Gold,\" so well known to American readers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BRITISH AMERICAN; a Colonial Magazine. Published monthly by Messrs.\r\nRollo & Adam, 61 King street, Toronto, Canada West.\r\n\r\nThe articles of this magazine are of varied interest, generally well\r\nwritten and able. \"What is Spectrum Analysis?\" given by the Editor in\r\nthe August number, is a contribution of research and merit.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHRISTIAN EXAMINER. Boston: By the proprietors, at Walker, Wise &\r\nCo.'s, 245 Washington street.\r\n\r\nContents: Tertullian and Montanism. The Reality of Fiction. Rome in the\r\nMiddle Age. Zschokke's Religious Meditations. Henry James on Creation.\r\nLoyalty in the West. Altar, Pulpit, and Platform, A Month of Victory\r\nand its Results. Review of Current Literature. Theology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Continental Monthly\r\n\r\n\r\nThe readers of the CONTINENTAL are aware of the important position it\r\nhas assumed, of the influence which it exerts, and of the brilliant\r\narray of political and literary talent of the highest order which\r\nsupports it. No publication of the kind has, in this country, so\r\nsuccessfully combined the energy and freedom of the daily newspaper with\r\nthe higher literary tone of the first-class monthly; and it is very\r\ncertain that no magazine has given wider range to its contributors, or\r\npreserved itself so completely from the narrow influences of party or of\r\nfaction. In times like the present, such a journal is either a power in\r\nthe land or it is nothing. That the CONTINENTAL is not the latter is\r\nabundantly evidenced _by what it has done_--by the reflection of its\r\ncounsels in many important public events, and in the character and power\r\nof those who are its staunchest supporters.\r\n\r\nThough but little more than a year has elapsed since the CONTINENTAL was\r\nfirst established, it has during that time acquired a strength and a\r\npolitical significance elevating it to a position far above that\r\npreviously occupied by any publication of the kind in America. In proof\r\nof which assertion we call attention to the following facts:\r\n\r\n1. Of its POLITICAL articles republished in pamphlet form, a single one\r\nhas had, thus far, a circulation of _one hundred and six thousand_\r\ncopies.\r\n\r\n2. From its LITERARY department, a single serial novel, \"Among the\r\nPines,\" has, within a very few months, sold nearly _thirty-five\r\nthousand_ copies. Two other series of its literary articles have also\r\nbeen republished in book form, while the first portion of a third is\r\nalready in press.\r\n\r\nNo more conclusive facts need be alleged to prove the excellence of the\r\ncontributions to the CONTINENTAL, or their _extraordinary popularity_;\r\nand its conductors are determined that it shall not fall behind.\r\nPreserving all \"the boldness, vigor, and ability\" which a thousand\r\njournals have attributed to it, it will greatly enlarge its circle of\r\naction, and discuss, fearlessly and frankly, every principle involved in\r\nthe great questions of the day. The first minds of the country,\r\nembracing the men most familiar with its diplomacy and most\r\ndistinguished for ability, are among its contributors; and it is no mere\r\n\"flattering promise of a prospectus\" to say that this \"magazine for the\r\ntimes\" will employ the first intellect in America, under auspices which\r\nno publication ever enjoyed before in this country.\r\n\r\nWhile the CONTINENTAL will express decided opinions on the great\r\nquestions of the day, it will not be a mere political journal: much the\r\nlarger portion of its columns will be enlivened, as heretofore, by\r\ntales, poetry, and humor. In a word, the CONTINENTAL will be found,\r\nunder its new staff of Editors, occupying a position and presenting\r\nattractions never before found in a magazine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTERMS TO CLUBS.\r\n\r\nTwo copies for one year, .......

No State in the Valley of the\r\nMississippi offers so great an inducement to the settler as the State of\r\nIllinois. There is no part of the world where all the conditions of\r\nclimate and soil so admirably combine to produce those two great\r\nstaples, CORN and WHEAT.\r\n\r\n~CLIMATE~.\r\n\r\nNowhere can the industrious farmer secure such immoderate results from\r\nhis labor as on these deep, rich, loamy soils, cultivated with so much\r\nease. The climate from the extreme southern part of the State to the\r\nTerre Haute, Alton and St. Louis Railroad, a distance of nearly 200\r\nmiles, is well adapted to Winter.\r\n\r\n~WHEAT, CORN, COTTON, TOBACCO~.\r\n\r\nPeaches, Pears, Tomatoes, and every variety of fruit and vegetables is\r\ngrown in great abundance, from which Chicago and other Northern markets\r\nare furnished from four to six weeks earlier than their immediate\r\nvicinity. Between the Terre Haute, Alton & St. Louis Railway and the\r\nKankakeo and Illinois Rivers, (a distance of 115 miles on the Branch,\r\nand 135 miles on the Main Trunk,) lies the great Corn and Stock raising\r\nportion of the State.\r\n\r\n~THE ORDINARY YIELD~.\r\n\r\nof Corn is from 50 to 80 bushels per acre. Cattle, Horses, Mules, Sheep\r\nand Hogs are raised here at a small cost, and yield large profits. It is\r\nbelieved that no section of country presents greater inducements for\r\nDairy Farming than the Prairies of Illinois, a branch of farming to\r\nwhich but little attention has been paid, and which must yield sure\r\nprofitable results. Between the Kankakee and Illinois Rivers, and\r\nChicago and Dunleith,(a distance of 56 miles on the Branch and 147 miles\r\nby the Main Trunk,) Timothy Hay, Spring Wheat, Corn, &c., are produced\r\nin great abundance.\r\n\r\n~AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS~.\r\n\r\nThe Agricultural products of Illinois are greater than those of any\r\nother State. The Wheat crop of 1861 was estimated at 85,000,000\r\nbushels, while the Corn crop yields not less than 140,000,000 bushels\r\nbesides the crop of Oats, Barley, Rye, Buckwheat, Potatoes, Sweet\r\nPotatoes, Pumpkins, Squashes, Flax, Hemp, Peas, Clover, Cabbage, Beets,\r\nTobacco, Sorgheim, Grapes, Peaches, Apples, &c., which go to swell the\r\nvast aggregate of production in this fertile region. Over Four Million\r\ntons of produce were sent out the State of Illinois during the past\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n~STOCK RAISING~.\r\n\r\nIn Central and Southern Illinois uncommon advantages are presented for\r\nthe extension of Stock raising. All kinds of Cattle, Horses, Mules,\r\nSheep, Hogs, &c., of the best breeds, yield handsome profits; large\r\nfortunes have already been made, and the field is open for others to\r\nenter with the fairest prospects of like results. DAIRY FARMING also\r\npresents its inducements to many.\r\n\r\n~CULTIVATION OF COTTON~.\r\n\r\n_The experiments in Cotton culture are of very great promise. Commencing\r\nin latitude 39 deg. 30 min. (see Mattoon on the Branch, and Assumption\r\non the Main Line), the Company owns thousands of acres well adapted to\r\nthe perfection of this fibre. A settler having a family of young\r\nchildren, can turn their youthful labor to a most profitable account in\r\nthe growth and perfection of this plant_.\r\n\r\n~THE ILLINOIS CENTRAL RAILROAD~.\r\n\r\nTraverses the whole length of the State, from the banks of the\r\nMississippi and Lake Michigan to the Ohio. As its name imports, the\r\nRailroad runs through the centre of the State, and on either side of\r\nthe road along its whole length lie the lands offered for sale.\r\n\r\n~CITIES, TOWNS, MARKETS, DEPOTS~.\r\n\r\nThere are Ninety-eight Depots on the Company's Railway, giving about one\r\nevery seven miles. Cities, Towns and Villages are situated at convenient\r\ndistances throughout the whole route, where every desirable commodity\r\nmay be found as readily as in the oldest cities of the Union, and where\r\nbuyers are to be met for all kinds of farm produce.\r\n\r\n~EDUCATION~.\r\n\r\nMechanics and working-men will find the free school system encouraged by\r\nthe State, and endowed with a large revenue for the support of the\r\nschools. Children can live in sight of the school, the college, the\r\nchurch, and grow up with the prosperity of the leading State in the\r\nGreat Western Empire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n~PRICES AND TERMS OF PAYMENT--ON LONG CREDIT~.\r\n\r\n80 acres at $10 per acre. with interest at 6 per ct. annually on the\r\nfollowing terms:\r\n\r\n  Cash payment.............$18.00\r\n  Payment in one year.......48.00\r\n     \"    in two years......48.00\r\n     \"    in three years....48.00\r\n     \"    in four years....236.00\r\n     \"    in five years....224.00\r\n     \"    in six years.....212.00\r\n     \"    in seven years...206.00\r\n\r\n40 acres, at $10.00 per acre:\r\n  Cash payment.............$24.00\r\n  Payment in one year.......24.00\r\n     \"    in two years......24.00\r\n     \"    in three years....24.00\r\n     \"    in four years....118.00\r\n     \"    in five years....112.00\r\n     \"    in six years.....106.00\r\n     \"    in seven years...100.00\r\n\r\nCommissioner.
