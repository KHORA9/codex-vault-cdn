On this occasion I was still welcome,\r\nbut _in spite of_ my nationality—an ugly truth that my mind almost\r\nrefuses to accept.\r\n\r\nTo compare impressions from these visits one must first ask: “How could\r\nsuch a change of attitude come to pass?”\r\n\r\nFormerly Great Britain was _the_ country of all countries that “counted”\r\nin Turkey. To be a “gentleman”—(they used the English word)—was the\r\nTurks’ highest ambition. British stuffs were chosen in preference to\r\nFrench, _not_ because they were finer or of greater value, but simply\r\nbecause they were _British_. Our ideals, our policy, and, I must add,\r\nour governesses, were almost regarded as sacred in Turkish eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd now I am advised, for greater safety, to travel as an American! God\r\nforbid! I stand by the old flag.\r\n\r\nI would smile, could the tears be hidden, when I recall the police\r\nofficer who so solemnly enquired if _I was sure_ I was not an American.\r\n\r\n“Perfectly sure,” I replied.\r\n\r\n“How then,” said he, “has that impossibility—an Englishwoman in\r\nAngora—become possible?”\r\n\r\n“Your Government,” I answered, “has made it possible. As you have no one\r\nelse here from my country, I have given myself this mission.... An old\r\nfriend of the Turks, a woman who loves her own country! Can she not do\r\n_something_ for that peace between us, which is a supreme necessity to\r\nboth? That is why I am here.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI do not forget that Turks were our “enemies” in the war. But they came\r\nback, beaten to the dust—and penitent. Then was the moment for us to\r\nhave made our own terms. In that mood Turkey would have\r\naccepted—anything, but the _one thing_ we imposed on her—the Greeks at\r\nSmyrna! That policy of sheer folly has transformed the veneration of her\r\npeople into fear and distrust, if not hate.\r\n\r\nUnjustly and unreasonably as we have behaved towards our old ally, we\r\nwere not, indeed, alone in this mischievous exalting of Greek\r\naggressions. Dare we not now own our mistake? We are great enough, and\r\nstrong enough, to be generous, to mend our ways!\r\n\r\nTo-day, surely, it is the duty of English patriots to pour oil on the\r\ntroubled waters, to explain to Turkey what _can_ be explained, and to\r\npaint our countrymen, at least, less “black” than they have been made to\r\nseem by our rivals’ pen!\r\n\r\nLausanne Palace Hotel,\r\n\r\n    Lausanne,\r\n\r\n

Ten years ago, to a beaten Turkey (unable, it was supposed, to\r\nface an enemy for years to come), I had taken the same trip. And now,\r\ndespite the prophets, I am returning to a victorious people; doubly\r\nvictorious, since all the odds were against them.\r\n\r\n“That is the kind of story I love,” I remarked to the sympathetic\r\ncaptain and his daughter, with whom I generally lunched as guest in\r\ntheir own cabin. They, indeed, were particularly interested in my\r\nadventure, for they knew the Near East well, and this was to be their\r\nlast visit. Because he had just reached the age limit of those who ‘go\r\ndown to the sea in ships,’ though it was only when you caught the word\r\n‘papa’ upon his daughter’s lips that anyone would suspect the fact.\r\n\r\nSo they are blessed who marry young!\r\n\r\n“It seems strange,” I told him one morning, “to be here—on board the\r\n_Pierre Loti_, and surely a presage of good luck, since his books have\r\ndone so much to increase and widen my inborn sympathies with the East.”\r\n\r\nStill more strange it proved; since the captain himself had named the\r\nship for his admiration of the great French writer and in memory of\r\npersonal friendship between them. A rare literary association for a\r\nsteamer once in the service of the Czars. Wherefore, also, I found the\r\nmaster’s works in the ship’s library, and could renew acquaintance with\r\nmany an old favourite: “Ramuntcho,” “Matelot,” “Ispahan,” “Les Pêcheurs\r\nd’Islande” and the “Désenchantées.”\r\n\r\nThe captain told me of his visit to Rochefort, and _I_ told _him_ how\r\nAntoine went to the same house for final instructions upon the staging\r\nof “Ramuntcho,” which, however, did not prove a success. How, indeed,\r\ncould anyone think of dramatising Pierre Loti, whether in prose or\r\nverse? He gives us neither psychology nor dramatic incident. I can only\r\nsuppose that Antoine permitted them to be produced—to show once for all\r\nthat the thing could not be done; a hard lesson for the master!\r\n\r\n“Among Loti’s collection of priceless treasures, rifled from every\r\ncorner of the East, Antoine sought in vain for somewhere to place his\r\nhat! Finally, he hooked it on to an Eastern idol, and their talk began.\r\nIn a few moments, however, there was a pause, for the astonished\r\ndramatist caught sight of the offending headgear suspended, as he\r\nsupposed, in mid-air. However, a closer look revealed that it was\r\nresting upon a thin stream of water. The Eastern idol was a fountain!”\r\n\r\nThe captain expressed his surprise that I should not only be so familiar\r\nwith Loti’s work, but that I could really know anything intimately of\r\nhis private life, “seeing how the Frenchman disliked my own country.”\r\n\r\n“My dear sir,” I replied, “if we are to find our friends to-day only\r\namong those who love England, we should be limited indeed. You and your\r\ncharming daughter, _par exemple_, are you precisely admirers of the\r\nBritish Government?...\r\n\r\n“To me, Art is first, and the rest—nowhere! I care not whether the\r\ngenius first saw daylight in Paris, in New York, or in Timbuctoo. I have\r\nmore friends out of England than in England. Like Kipling’s cat, ‘all\r\nplaces are alike to me.’ I only ask that your land be warm; and with all\r\npeoples who do not rob me I am ready and eager to be good friends. To\r\n‘guard the frontiers’ in Art would be to bring back the Dark Ages. The\r\nmost sincere love of one’s own country should never teach one to be\r\ndisdainful of _les autres_.”\r\n\r\n“You are going to Nationalist Turkey,” he replied, “you will find\r\nyourself right up against Chauvinism all the time.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe it. Forgive me, I really think you exaggerate. And\r\nbesides—with my strong sympathies for the Turks!—I have always found\r\nOrientals the most broad-minded men.”\r\n\r\nThen I brought back the talk to Pierre Loti. “Why do you say that he\r\ndislikes England so much?” I asked. “He _does_ object to golf near the\r\nPyramids; he _is_ a little sarcastic about ‘Messrs. Thos. Cook & Co.,\r\nEgypt, Ltd.,’ forgetting what it means to travel without them; he\r\ndislikes our Government for its pro-Greek policy and its injustice\r\ntowards the Turks. As an Englishwoman I agree. And, like him, too, I\r\nregard New York as the nearest earthly approach to hell! We certainly do\r\nnot hate America; only its noise, its materialism, and its advertising.\r\n\r\n“I knew Pierre Loti best, perhaps, at his charming Basque home in\r\nHendaye—thanks to my friendship with his heroines, Melek and Zeyneb. I\r\nknow, at one time, he resented what seemed to him our Edward VII.’s\r\n‘interference’ in French affairs. But that master of diplomats never\r\ngave his advice unasked; and, when he was told of the great Frenchman’s\r\nhostility, Pierre Loti was promptly invited to Windsor, and they became\r\nthe best of friends. Would he were with us now, that he might but talk\r\nwith the Ministers of both nations!\r\n\r\n“After Windsor, Loti, I’m sure, would have spared his sarcasm. ‘There is\r\none thing left now,’ he once declared. ‘We must appeal to H.M. Edward\r\nVII. _He_ only can do what he likes in France!’ The French Admiralty had\r\njust refused him permission to carry away from one of their ships the\r\ntable on which he had written the ‘Désenchantées.’”\r\n\r\nThe captain, it seemed, was ready to waive this point.\r\n\r\n“But I do not consider,” he resumed, “that Loti’s books are a true\r\npicture of Turkey as she is.”\r\n\r\n“They would not, indeed, suit his arch-enemy Messrs. Cook,” I replied;\r\n“as Turner painted, he wrote, for those who have eyes to see. Tell him\r\nyou never saw _his_ Turkey, and he would reply: ‘Don’t you wish you\r\ncould?’...\r\n\r\n“Had Loti himself been English, he would, naturally, have reached a\r\nlarger public among us. The warmth of his colouring is too often lost in\r\ntranslation. As a schoolgirl I learnt by heart the wonderful Preface to\r\nhis “Ispahan”: ‘_Qui vent venir avec moi voir les roses d’Ispahan_,’ and\r\nI have dreamt of those roses ever since.”\r\n\r\nThe captain then spoke of the avenue at Constantinople which bears his\r\nname.\r\n\r\n“A charming remembrance,” I replied, “but he needs no such ‘rosemary.’\r\nDo we realise, I wonder, what French influence in the Near East owes to\r\nhis supreme art. In England, except for a small minority, the word\r\nTurkey only means a vision of fair houris, veiled in the mysteries of\r\nthe past, the great ‘Red’ Sultan, and massacres in Armenia. To France it\r\nmeans Aziadé, the Green Mosque at Brousse, Djénane, and the Fantômes\r\nd’Orient. Public opinion, to-day, can be ‘manufactured’ as easily as\r\nbutter and cheese; but the imaginations once stirred by the magician’s\r\npen will not yield so easily to the last Brew of Hate. France is not\r\ngoing to lose her dream of the East woven from Loti’s pen. A debt of\r\ngratitude neither she, nor Turkey itself, can ever pay.”\r\n\r\nTo travel by this steamer, bearing the name of a writer one loves so\r\nwell, brings unceasing delight. Your menu-card, the life-belts on deck,\r\neven the towels, all bear a name to fill the mind with memory of\r\nbeautiful things. As my eyes fell on the _Pierre Loti’s_ lifeboat,\r\nswinging on its davits, I recalled the “Pêcheurs d’Islande,” with its\r\ntragic close: “and he never returned!” All the sorrow, the suffering,\r\nand the heart-ache; the useless watching, waiting, and longing—this, for\r\nthe women, is War!\r\n\r\nAre we, indeed, to begin _that_ all over again? For a “Greater Greece”\r\nthan the Greeks themselves can sustain?\r\n\r\nIf _all_ women who have suffered (and who has not?) would march to\r\nWestminster to protest, would any hear and pause? Can we fight a Press\r\nin the service of profiteers, bolstering up the Government, blocking the\r\npublic view?\r\n\r\nAre we not, after all, mere “pawns” of a Destiny that none can avert?\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPierre Loti’s long and interesting life is now very quickly drawing to\r\nits close. He has written his last words—a defence of his beloved Turks.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                TURKEY AND TOLERANCE—A FRIENDSHIP WASTED\r\n\r\n\r\nMY supreme interest in Turkey among the Moslem nations, arose from\r\ninfluences, or instincts, I cannot now with any certainty determine. I\r\nsuspect, however, it was in part reaction against the injustice of\r\nGladstone—the idol of my father’s youth, until the betrayal of his hero\r\nGordon—and in part indignation with those who called the Koran an\r\n“accursed book.” _My_ religion is the universal tolerance I expect for\r\nmy own, and I can feel only the most profound admiration for the Great\r\nProphet of Islam, whose fine personality has left so benign an influence\r\nthroughout the East, and for his “Bible,” with its noble study of our\r\nown Christ. Carlyle, you will remember, pays glowing tribute to this\r\n“Prophet Hero!”\r\n\r\nSo I devoured every book that I could lay hands on about these\r\ninteresting peoples; fought for introductions to anyone who could talk\r\nof them, from book-knowledge or personal acquaintance; studied\r\nmedicine—that their women might suffer less.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1906 that I first met Pierre Loti’s “disenchanted” heroines,\r\nZeyneb and Melek; and we soon became the closest friends. The tale of\r\ntheir daring, but unpractical, flight had stirred my imagination. Their\r\nfather was one of Abdul Hamid’s Ministers, and two or three times during\r\nmy visit they were almost kidnapped by order of the Sultan. On one\r\noccasion it was, indeed, only a miracle which disclosed the plot that\r\nwas to have carried them off (by motor from Nice to Marseilles, thence\r\nback by boat to Constantinople) to the punishment awaiting them.\r\n\r\nFor hours they held me spellbound by their vivid descriptions of harem\r\nlife, particularly the Sultan’s, and of the “Terror” under Abdul Hamid.\r\nWith this clever monster at the helm, the Turks suffered a hundred times\r\nmore than the Christians. Whole regiments of Albanians ceased to exist;\r\nwhole companies went off to Yemen and were forgotten; Ministers died\r\nsuddenly, and private families disappeared wholesale. Yet they must be\r\nthrown out of Europe, “bag and baggage,” because, in a minor degree,\r\nChristian Armenians, too, bled under Abdul Hamid!\r\n\r\nAfter the departure of the two Hanoums (Turkish ladies), their father\r\ndied suddenly. And though, when in Constantinople, I did my best to see\r\nand console their widowed mother, she persisted in regarding me as one\r\nof those _giaours_ who had stolen away her daughters! And would listen\r\nto no defence or explanation.\r\n\r\nIt was then that I heard much of the coming Revolution: when and where\r\n“meetings” had taken place, who were members of the “secret societies,”\r\nwhich of their friends in prison would be liberated. In 1908, the Day of\r\nDeliverance suddenly came, to the astonishment of the whole world, and\r\nI, too, rejoiced, as though my own country were now set free!\r\n\r\nI was, luckily, again in Constantinople for those great days. I saw the\r\nhideous tyrant of a few years ago driven through the streets of Pera; I\r\nwas present at the opening of Parliament; introduced to the Sultan Abdul\r\nHamid and his Grand Vizier Kiamil Pasha.\r\n\r\nIt was the Vizier’s charming daughter who soon became my dearest friend,\r\nand hostess for two subsequent visits. Once she spoke of me to Abdul\r\nHamid’s successor, Mohammed V., as her “English sister” (her favourite\r\nterm of endearment), and the Sultan replied: “I did not know Kiamil\r\nPasha had any English children.” Poor man, he had a Turkish family of a\r\nscore!\r\n\r\nIt was Hamid’s fall that first revealed to me how much Turkey loved\r\nEngland, what she was ready to give for British friendship. I had\r\nwitnessed the arrival of our Ambassador, the late Sir G. Lowther, and\r\nhis triumphant entry to Constantinople, when the horses were taken out\r\nof his carriage and he was drawn by Turks to the Embassy. As Abdul Hamid\r\nhad compromised the nation by friendship with Germans, young Turkey\r\nthrew herself at the feet of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nWhy could we not respond? Alas, our Ambassador and his French colleague,\r\nM. Constant, would openly express their preference for the despotic\r\nAbdul Hamid. And what was said, no doubt with no serious thought of\r\noffence, reached the ears of the young Turks and stung their pride:\r\n“People who visit Constantinople may be divided into two classes: those\r\nwho like dirt and squalor” (of whom I was one), “and those who do not!”\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that the Germans should make _their_ profit from _our_\r\ndiscourtesy and blind contempt. We ought, from the first, to have known\r\nthat she would send, as indeed she did, one of her finest diplomats to\r\nConstantinople. Marshall von Bieberstein, and his “retriever,” Dr. W——\r\nof the _Frankfurter Zeitung_ lost no opportunity of conciliating the\r\nyoung Turks, to what end we might, surely, have foreseen!\r\n\r\nAfter the Balkan war, I paid a visit to vanquished Turkey; this time as\r\na guest of my “Turkish sister” in Stamboul, whose father had been,\r\nmeanwhile, banished to Cyprus, where he died. Under the circumstances I\r\ncould not (for fear of further compromising my friends with the\r\nGovernment) see much of our Ambassador, Sir Louis Mallet, though I met\r\nhim twice, and found him a charming man.\r\n\r\nTo all my appeals, at the Embassy and elsewhere, for British friendship\r\nand help to put Turkey on her feet again, I met the same foolish,\r\n“parrot” reply: “We cannot sacrifice Russia!” Nevertheless, when I\r\nreturned to London, and published “An Englishwoman in a Turkish Harem”\r\n(the diary record of private friendships, widely circulated in the\r\nEast), we, the friends of Turkey, determined to defy the Government, and\r\nformed an Ottoman Society for that purpose.\r\n\r\nWhen the war broke out I had just reached Berlin, once more _en route_\r\nfor Turkey, Asia Minor, and afterwards Persia and India.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the world-tragedy had even a sharper sting for those\r\nof us who were bidden to hate our life-long “best friends” among the\r\nenemy peoples. Often enough, moreover, the individual “foe” (as was the\r\ncase with my Turkish “sister”) could not throw off the heart’s\r\nallegiance to England merely because “it was war.”\r\n\r\nCan we, indeed, honestly blame the young Turks? In the first place, they\r\ndid not choose their own path. One man, Enver Pasha, joined Germany\r\n_against_ the wishes of a whole nation. As _one_ man, Mr. Lloyd George,\r\nwould once have drawn the most constitutional of all peoples to fight\r\nthe Turks, had not General Harington, luckily for them and us, disobeyed\r\nhis command!\r\n\r\nBesides, we did _nothing_ to preserve our friendship with Turkey. Years\r\nof indifference, and most impolitic scoffings at real reforming\r\nenthusiasm, were followed, at the eleventh hour, by total neglect of any\r\nconciliating diplomacy, which could even then have kept Turkey out of\r\nthe war, and shortened it by two years.\r\n\r\nFor instance, on the outbreak of war with Germany, “without notice,\r\nwithout the most banal of the forms of courtesy, on the very day when\r\nthe Turkish flag should have been hoisted over the ships handed over to\r\nthe Ottoman Commission, which had come to England to take charge of\r\nthem, the dreadnoughts were seized by Great Britain and no offer was\r\nmade by the British Government to refund, at least, the price of the two\r\nships....” So wrote the late Grand Vizier Hakki Pasha; and one could\r\nmention many other, similar, senseless pin-pricks, which may inflame\r\nsuch people almost more than insults of greater import.\r\n\r\nDuring the war my friendship for Turkey proved a serious handicap in\r\nhospital work. Anyone jealous of what privileges were by chance accorded\r\nto me would hand over a few choice tit-bits—that grew in passing—to the\r\nsecret police. The French, unless in a fit of really inevitable\r\nwar-depression, paid scant heed to such reports. The Americans, however,\r\neasily took alarm. One, I remember, actually spoke to me about the\r\nmatter with a terror only equalled, in my experience, by that of the\r\nCabinet Minister’s brother who once asked me: “How I could do anything\r\nso foolish as to live in a harem?”\r\n\r\nIt was a poor compliment to one of Turkey’s greatest statesmen, and to\r\nmy hostess, his distinguished daughter.\r\n\r\nBut when I found that Roget’s “Thesaurus” gives as synonym for a harem,\r\n“a house of ill fame,” I understood!\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTurkey, however, was crushed, defeated and, at Sèvres, humiliated. Were\r\nwe not courting disaster by such unjust terms? If we remove the foot\r\nholding them down—but ever so slightly—will they rebound and strike?\r\n\r\n“I cannot understand,” I said to one of their delegates, “how a Turk\r\ncould be found to sign such a Treaty.” For always, with all their\r\nfaults, I had known them proud.\r\n\r\n“Had we not signed,” he answered, “the Greeks would have entered\r\nConstantinople, and God knows when we could have driven them out. What\r\ndoes it matter, the Treaty will not be ratified.”\r\n\r\nTo keep out the Greeks, to save bloodshed! Maybe he was right.\r\n\r\n“At least, we are set free from Germany,” they said; and there is little\r\nwe could not have asked then for such security.\r\n\r\nThey would have allowed Great Britain any privileges, any concessions,\r\nall sovereign rights, if only we had not permitted the occupation of\r\nSmyrna! When the Dutch _pasteur_, M. Lebouvier, sent the _Times_ a full\r\ndescription of all the hideous bloodshed, the saturnalian orgies, and\r\nthe riot with which the Greeks celebrated their triumphal entry, it was\r\n_suppressed_—and Englishmen do not know!\r\n\r\nConsternation, despair, and anger were the order of the day. Those\r\nhitherto most apologetic for the part played by Turkey in the war, were\r\nnow ready to glory in what they had done. A million and a half Turks\r\nenslaved by 300,000 “servant” Greeks! Can such things be?\r\n\r\nIn Constantinople a mass meeting of 250,000 people was held at the\r\nByzantine Hippodrome, flags and banners were draped in black, women\r\nsobbed as at a funeral. They were _mourning_, indeed, for the city they\r\nwere afterwards accused of having burned!\r\n\r\nBy what deplorable influence were we thus moved to attempt what would\r\npractically have meant the extermination of Turkey? The magic name of\r\nVenizelos is not enough! Again and again, the friends of Turkey have\r\nasked why? But we do not know whether British action was deliberate or\r\nthe result of an incredibly big blunder!\r\n\r\nM. Kemal Pasha’s great victory changed the face of affairs. Few in\r\nEngland had seemed to care what happened to this band of “rebels”; only\r\na month before his victory, even our Intelligence Officers thought he\r\nwould easily be beaten by the Greeks. Few had even heard of his three\r\nand a half years exile in the mountains!\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, at home, we paid little heed, and scant courtesy, to the\r\nthree Ambassadors from Angora, who came to negotiate peace. Békir Sami\r\nBey’s confidential conversations with the ex-Prime Minister about the\r\nSoviet Government were handed on to M. Krassine. Youssouf Kemal Bey,\r\nindeed, obtained a hearing, but nothing was done. Fethi Bey (the\r\nMinister of the Interior, sent as a last resource) was told, and that\r\nwas true, that Lord Curzon was seriously ill, but that no one “counted”\r\nin England except Mr. Lloyd George. Naturally, he asked the Premier for\r\nan audience, which was “promised,” but never given!\r\n\r\n_Incivility does not pay._ It is too expensive a luxury for the greatest\r\nof nations. This level-headed Turk, accepting such treatment with all\r\nthe dignity of his race, found many _other_ things to praise in this\r\ncountry. “The English,” he said, “understand only _one_ form of\r\npropaganda—the sword!” But of our institutions, our Parliament, our\r\nclubs, and the marvellous acting of Miss Sybil Thorndike in “Jane\r\nClegg,” he said much, and nothing but praise, in Angora!\r\n\r\nAs a woman who has received the greatest kindness and courtesy from the\r\nTurks, my resentment, on behalf of Fethi Bey, was expressed with\r\nunmeasured indignation. His mission was _not_ taken seriously; the\r\nGovernment dared to show him the cold shoulder!\r\n\r\nFor his part, most graciously he suggested that I should come over to\r\nAngora myself, to the cradle of the Nationalist movement, and see the\r\nhero of the Nationalists.\r\n\r\nBut for his ever-ready assistance it would have been useless to have\r\nmade the attempt. When, in Angora, he renewed his apologies for all the\r\ndiscomfort I had endured, but I told him the journey itself had been a\r\nprivilege, for it enabled me to see with my own eyes what his people had\r\nbeen driven to endure.\r\n\r\nNo, I could never have forgiven myself if, in a moment of weakness, I\r\nhad been discouraged by the chivalry of the British officials and\r\nallowed them to persuade me to stay at home.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n           MALTA: THE NAME I WAS TO HEAR THROUGHOUT ANATOLIA\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR first stopping-place was Malta, the name I was destined to hear from\r\none end of Anatolia to the other.\r\n\r\nWas it not of Malta that Angora was born; and since “the trouble” in the\r\nEast, Malta has been turned into a universal dumping-ground for\r\nofficers’ wives and refugees. Whenever M. Kemal Pasha lifts his little\r\nfinger, or Rauf Bey opens his mouth, the women and children are bundled\r\noff to Malta. They return, indeed, on any excuse, at the first\r\nopportunity (as why should they not?), until a panic-stricken Government\r\nagain sends them to exile. One lady with us had done the trip in this\r\nway four times!\r\n\r\nConstantinople, without our women, makes one wonder if it were so wise\r\nas it appears, thus to play for safety! After all, cannot the\r\nEnglishwoman endure what the Russian, Greek and Armenian are left to put\r\nup with? If the husband is in danger, should not his wife be with him?\r\n“We want to ‘protect’ our women,” I had been told, and there is no finer\r\nideal than chivalry. But, after Constantinople, I would suggest that we\r\nwomen also “want to protect our men!”\r\n\r\nSoftening, perhaps, the frankness for which my “French” education has\r\nbeen so often held responsible, I would only say: “There are alluring\r\ndistractions!”\r\n\r\nAnd in marriage I pin my faith upon the Italian proverb: “Keep to the\r\nwomen and cows of your own country.”\r\n\r\nThe utter destitution of so many members of the old Russian aristocracy,\r\nhas not deprived its women of their temperamental charm. It has provided\r\nthem with an occasion (genuine enough, God knows) for tears no British\r\nyouth can resist, unmoved as he will remain under the fiercest\r\nshell-fire.\r\n\r\nYet one Englishman told me his Russian wife had taken every penny he\r\npossessed, and vanished—he knew not where. Another “fears it is only a\r\nmatter of time. His ‘noble’ wife cannot be expected to put up with\r\nClapham, and when something better turns up, he will be discarded.” One\r\nmarried “a sweet, soft voice” out of sheer loneliness; and another,\r\nfoolish and rich, clothed in priceless ermine the lady he met “at a\r\nbar!” There is no need to dwell on other, less honourable,\r\n“consequences” of such “casual” meetings.\r\n\r\nAt every corner in Constantinople the “bar” invites the busy and the\r\nbrave to cocktails or a whisky, an example we have given the “despised”\r\nTurk, who had the wisdom to make Angora “dry.” Here, too, is the best of\r\nchances for pro-Greek propaganda, as our men meet no “Turkish” women,\r\nwho are “really” safe in the bosom of their families. One is tempted,\r\nalmost, to hope that for them the day of “freedom” may be postponed.\r\n\r\nFacing this ugly side of what an “Army of Occupation” must always\r\nentail, does the Englishwoman who absolutely refused to “leave” need to\r\nstand on her defence? “Vanity Fair,” moreover, may serve to remind us\r\nthat there were English women near Waterloo; and do our present\r\ngeneration require such careful wrapping in cotton-wool, while they are,\r\nnevertheless, too often left unprotected in the drab, hum-drum life of a\r\nmodern “business” world.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable, again, to reflect that every Turk one meets, who\r\nreally “counts for something” in Angora, is a “Malta” man. If M. Kemal\r\nPasha believed in decorations, surely a special medal would have been\r\ndevised for those who had “visited” Malta.\r\n\r\nAs a prison, it is agreeable enough, though the climate strikes one as\r\nenervating. The sun shines, even brightly, for the greater part of the\r\nyear, and sunshine softens the captive’s lot! Had I never visited the\r\nisland I should have soon learnt to know “the sights,” for in so many\r\nhomes of Angora, Maltese picture postcards are displayed, almost like\r\nholy relics: Valetta, the “Chapel of Bones” (a barbaric idea), the\r\nMahommedan cemetery, the cathedral, and the landing-stage. Everywhere,\r\ntoo, are the fair ladies of Malta, whose head-dresses closely resemble\r\nthe Turkish tcharchaff.\r\n\r\nThe Angelus had sounded as I first entered the cathedral, to find myself\r\namidst long rows of black-veiled women, reverently kneeling on the cold\r\ninlaid-marble floor, their heads bent in prayer, their fingers counting\r\nthe beads as they recited their rosaries. The native type is\r\ndark-skinned, almost Mongolian, but they all speak English. For are they\r\nnot British subjects, paid in British money, and entitled to our\r\nprotection? There was talk, indeed, of extending the cover of\r\n“Nationalism” to them also; but, personally, I still felt everywhere,\r\nand all the time, that calming atmosphere of order, happiness, and\r\nprosperity that is brought by the British flag.\r\n\r\nHow is it, then, that we have so consistently failed to quiet the\r\nTurkish storms? Of course, every one of the “powers” has been involved,\r\neach playing for its own hand, striving to end or prolong the war in its\r\nown interests.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the Turk himself has above all committed one\r\ncrime—he has kept Constantinople!\r\n\r\nBent on a policy of peace (!) we undertook to disarm Turkey; but the\r\nmission despatched to Anatolia for this purpose could, or would, not\r\naccomplish its task. Then in May, 1919, despite the Mudros Armistice, we\r\nallowed the Greeks to occupy Smyrna! In March of the following year,\r\ncame the English _coup d’état_!\r\n\r\nThe highest personalities—generals, important officials, anyone\r\nsuspected of sympathy with the Nationalists—were arrested, placed in the\r\nhold of a man-of-war, for internment at Malta. All were taken on mere\r\nsuspicion, thrust into prison without trial!\r\n\r\nYet the _naïveté_ of the whole proceeding is almost _more_ puzzling than\r\nits high-handed injustice! These dangerous men (!), supposed to be\r\nplotting against Great Britain, are all huddled together, and left to\r\ntheir own devices, for two years—and then released! Were we afraid? Did\r\nwe repent? Will Government never _pursue_ one policy to its logical\r\nconclusion?\r\n\r\nI could but “wonder about” these things as I knelt in prayer. Clouds of\r\nincense have filled the cathedral, the Blessed Sacrament is safely\r\nreturned to the tabernacle, the huge candles are extinguished, and the\r\nveiled ladies are reverently leaving the dimly-lighted church. Cannot\r\nfaith bring peace?\r\n\r\n“There must be peace.” I, who have faith in the spoken word, will\r\ndeclare it, everywhere and all the time, and will count him traitor who\r\nutters a word to the contrary. But I will tell them in Angora that “I am\r\nsorry for” Malta!\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFethi Bey, Minister of the Interior, carries his comfortable Turkish\r\nphilosophy to the last extreme. Whatever happens, he will say that “It\r\nmight have been worse.” In Malta, he acknowledged that he would have\r\npreferred greater comfort, but, then, “he _might_ have been much more\r\nuncomfortable!” In any case, he seized upon the chance to learn English,\r\nand learnt it remarkably well. It is best, he believes, to understand an\r\nenemy; and, to that end, you must learn his language. Of Mr. Lloyd\r\nGeorge, he declared that “Turkey owes him a debt of gratitude we can\r\nnever repay.... But for the occupation of Smyrna, and the Malta _coup\r\nd’état_, there would have been no Nationalists. But for your Prime\r\nMinister we might all of us have been vassals. Indeed, we owe him a\r\ngreat deal.”\r\n\r\nWhen I asked him what to expect in Angora, he warned me that “I must not\r\nlook for the luxuries of the Savoy.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I can leave our jazz bands without one pang,” I replied.\r\n\r\n“But you may find worse things in Angora than Jazz bands.”\r\n\r\nMen like Fethi Bey, ready to meet all emergencies without complaint,\r\nmake the right material to face the problem of Reconstruction, in a\r\ncountry ruined from end to end; and what a comfort it is to meet a man\r\nwithout a grievance!\r\n\r\nWhen I attempted to sympathise with him for having to ride, because no\r\nmotor could take these snow-blocked roads, he declared that “exercise\r\nwould do him good.” When his horse stumbled, “it might have been worse.”\r\n\r\nYet, on _my_ account, he apologised again and again for the condition of\r\nAngora; and I could only compare his humorous comparison with the Savoy,\r\nto Dr. Réchad’s strange attempt at consolation: “You certainly won’t\r\nneed any evening dresses.”\r\n\r\nIt is, no doubt, the gift for always making the best of a bad bargain,\r\nthat works for peace in the Turkish home. Your husband is not perfect,\r\nbut “he might be worse”; the food is bad, but there might not be any; if\r\nthe rooms are not clean, “we have known dirtier.” It is an\r\n“accommodating” point of view!\r\n\r\nThere is a story by Nasreddin Hodja, the great Turkish wit, which\r\nhappily illustrates this racial characteristic. The Anatolian lived in\r\nconstant terror of a vociferous wife, though no doubt he often reflected\r\nthat there were worse women in the world. One day, however, someone told\r\nhim that she had fallen into the river, and was being carried away by\r\nthe tide. “Don’t worry,” said he, with a stoic’s calm, “she will go\r\nagainst it. She always does.”\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, this man of wit had carried a basket of figs to the\r\nlame Timur, on an official visit of respect. Timur amused himself by\r\nthrowing the fruit in the Hodja’s face; but at each blow he cried out:\r\n“Allah is Great.” When asked why he so often praised God, he answered:\r\n“My wife wanted me to bring you apples.” Since Timur was privileged, if\r\nit pleased him, to strike the guest, he “thanked God” that he had chosen\r\n_the smaller_ and lighter fruit.\r\n\r\nAs for my own mission in Malta, I had really come to buy a British\r\nflag!, as Messrs. Cook’s manager at Naples had supplied “everything” but\r\njust that.\r\n\r\nFor years I have never travelled without a Union Jack. The idea of\r\nundertaking so long and dangerous a journey without it, filled me with\r\nstrange foreboding. Everywhere on the Front I had my “flag.” In a state\r\nof coma at the military hospital, the nuns were in great distress\r\nbecause I had expressed a wish to be buried in the flag, which, being\r\nunder my pillow, was nowhere to be found! Naturally, in Paris I had\r\nforeseen my need. But the registered trunk, booked to Rome, had fallen\r\non evil days, and there will be no luck for the “thief,” who is probably\r\npolishing his boots with my sacred relic!\r\n\r\nAt first, I seemed unable to escape the lace-makers of Malta; and when,\r\nfollowing the direction of a naval officer, I found myself at last in a\r\nreal “Harrod’s Store,” my luck, also, was still out. At the Army and\r\nNavy, the managing director declared they had “no sale for Union\r\nJacks.”... Each man possessed his own. He dared not sell me the firm’s\r\nflag, for an order to hoist it might be given at any moment; and, if he\r\nfailed to obey, he would very likely be driven out of the island!\r\n\r\nAs a last resource, I drove to a man said to have “flags for hire.” By\r\nthis time I was too frenzied with disappointment to conceal my\r\neagerness, and they promised me one for £7! Luckily enough, excitement\r\nprompted me to unfurl my treasure then and there, to find myself gazing,\r\nin mute astonishment, upon the Stars and Stripes! “Isn’t it the same\r\nthing?” cried the impostor, as I flung myself out of the shop.\r\n\r\nBut time and tide wait for no woman, and I must silence my\r\nsuperstitions, to join the _Pierre Loti_ once more. Taking a last look\r\non the fortifications of Malta, my thoughts turned to the imprisoned\r\nTurks, and my heart was filled with shame.\r\n\r\nOne day, perhaps, the Turks may hold Malta sacred, for assuredly the\r\ncream of her people were gathered there. One might almost have thought\r\nthat such men as Prince Said Halim (late Grand Vizier), Rauf Bey, Fethi\r\nBey, Hussein Djahid, and my admirable Angora guide,) Vely-Nedjdat, had\r\nbeen carefully selected to keep each other company.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stan-Harding once said of her eight and a half months in a Soviet\r\nprison: “At least I had this advantage, I met the best people in\r\nRussia.” As her hearers seemed puzzled by such a statement, she added,\r\n“They were all, naturally, in prison!”\r\n\r\nI must tell them, in Angora, that England, at least, has always honestly\r\ntried to put right her own wrong-doings, and one day (may it be soon!)\r\nshe will “redeem” herself to them also.\r\n\r\nMr. H. G. Wells somewhere describes the strange, great love we often\r\nfeel for those we have deeply wronged—the wife, the friend, the enemy.\r\nMay it not, at the long last, be so “after the war?”\r\n\r\nWho knows if, indeed, this be not the dark hour before the dawn, of our\r\nnation’s friendships—with those we have been led to hate?\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n           ATHENS—“WE HAVE LOVED HELEN; MUST WE DIVORCE HER?”\r\n\r\n\r\nIF only it were always calm, how delightful it would be to travel by\r\nsea!\r\n\r\nFROM Malta to Athens, indeed, is not a long run; but when every moment\r\nyou are tossed from side to side, at the mercy of all the winds in\r\nheaven, most things have a disagreeable look. As we approached the brown\r\nand arid coast of this historic peninsula, I thought how unjust it seems\r\nto have driven the Ottoman Greeks out of fertile Turkey to a fatherland\r\nthat cannot feed them. You cannot obtain blood from a stone, nor\r\nfruitful crops from an unfertile soil. What is Greece to do for these\r\npoor people, who cannot all turn merchants or moneylenders?\r\n\r\nBefore landing at Piræus, with my Italian escort, I took the precaution\r\nto investigate the rate of exchange—250 drachmas to the £1 sterling.\r\n\r\n“It is strange,” said I, “that we have none of this inconvenience in\r\nTurkey. There one always gets a fair ‘exchange,’ and no worry.”\r\n\r\nThe steamer slows down to anchor, and on all sides we are hustled by\r\nmodern Shylocks. “Two hundred and fifty drachmas for a pound,” I asked,\r\n“how many for five shillings?” And the Greek answered: “Fifteen.” “Come\r\nand listen to this Greek arithmetic,” I called in Italian; but the man\r\nunderstood me, and let out a hearty laugh. Though I turned from him,\r\nwithout malice, he promptly raised his price from fifteen to forty-five\r\n(!), and in the end I bought drachmas enough to take us ashore, hoping\r\nfor better terms on land.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget that day at Piræus—heat and dust, flies and\r\nrefugees. Could a more terrible combination be imagined? All along the\r\nquays lay these wretched folk, many of them fast asleep, with armies of\r\nflies crawling over them. If by chance one stumbled over a dusky body,\r\nwhich it was not easy to distinguish from the soil, a cloud of flies\r\nrose to smite you in the face—the most fatal of disease-carriers! The\r\nbrown-faced women, dirtier even than the Neopolitans, now crowded round\r\nus, offering cakes and sweets from which they were every moment obliged\r\nto brush off thick coatings of flies, that once more struck one in the\r\nface or settled over my shoulders.\r\n\r\nMy Italian escort had, meanwhile, kindly procured a newspaper to act as\r\nfan, and now, hurriedly brushing away these horrible pests, he took a\r\nsilk handkerchief out of his pocket to cover my neck. “What a\r\nmagnificent husband you will make for someone,” I said, smiling with\r\ngratitude; and he blushed with all the charm of his twenty-one years.\r\n\r\nIn another moment my eye fell on the hard brown faces and big “Jewish”\r\nnoses of the moneylenders, forcing a smile as they call on you to “buy.”\r\nThey have very much the same expression as Southern Italians; keeping\r\none eye, it would almost seem, to make a pleasant impression on possible\r\npurchasers, while the other betrays the keen and swift reckoning of\r\nprofits to the uttermost farthing.\r\n\r\nSeated behind little tables topped with boxes of glass, they are eagerly\r\ndisplaying their filthy paper money; haggling, arguing, smiling, and\r\ncheating you in one breath! Surely no type of humanity could carry us\r\nfurther from the heroes of our schoolday imaginings!\r\n\r\nWearied with fly-dodging, in fact, I had scant energy left for a “good\r\nbargain,” over this “paper filth” for honest English sterling.\r\n\r\nSympathy now prompted me to ask the Italian Whether his eyes were not in\r\npain; and, by the power of auto-suggestion, the inquiry caused my own to\r\nache as they had never ached before. Before we landed the captain had\r\ngiven me a solemn warning on no account to rub my eyes, however\r\ntormented by the continual glare of a bright sun on white houses, or I\r\nshould be certain to “catch an incurable eye-disease and go on ‘weeping’\r\nto the end of my days.”\r\n\r\n“Never, never speak of disease again,” I had answered. “Misfortunes come\r\nquickly enough, without our going to fetch them.”\r\n\r\nFortunately even the flies could not make it a _long_ journey from\r\nPiræus to Athens; and we could glance in passing at the quaint and not\r\nunattractive bookstalls, now showing large photographs of modern\r\n“Heroes”—the Greek generals! After all, they had done their best. _They_\r\nwere no more responsible for the mistakes of _their_ Government, than we\r\nare for ours.\r\n\r\nTaking train for the last part of our route, we were packed like\r\nsardines among the ugliest possible types of human beings one could\r\nimagine; but, luckily, soon alighted at a station whose magic name\r\nshould thrill the dullest heart.\r\n\r\nWe were in Athens! But the Italian could only exclaim: “What women!” I\r\nreminded him that they were, after all, descended from Helen of Troy,\r\nfor whose beauty the world in its youth made war. Yet it seemed almost a\r\nheresy to name that name in such surroundings.\r\n\r\nIf only one could show all men what a tragedy is here.\r\n\r\n“There is something I long to do,” I told my companion. “I would summon\r\ncrowds of my countrymen and my countrywomen to the Albert Hall and\r\nborrow the magic tongue of Mr. Lloyd George, to draw their tears for our\r\ndear Christian brethren at the mercy of the brutal Turk! And then a\r\ndeputation of these money-changing Greeks should be brought in to stand\r\nat the Welshman’s right hand and his left!”\r\n\r\nHow many, even then, would read, mark, and digest the grim comment?\r\n\r\nBut the Italian laughed again and again at the picture my words\r\nsuggested. I could only murmur: “What is it, to be twenty-one!”\r\n\r\nI believe we went into every church in Athens; for ever since I left\r\nhome I have never passed a church or a mosque without sparing a moment\r\nto enter and pray for peace. “It will do no good,” said my companion,\r\nand I replied: “It will do no harm.”\r\n\r\nWe saw many women also at prayer, kneeling before their Ikons—not for\r\nvictory, but in sad thoughts of their own dead, and for help and\r\nstrength to bear their own terrible sorrows.\r\n\r\nOnce the Greek Pope came up and spoke to us, supposing, to my young\r\nItalian’s honest confusion, that we were man and wife. The spirit moved\r\nhim to denounce, in very broken French, the treachery of England; and,\r\nwhether or no it was from heat and fatigue, or from the sight of those\r\nbroken-hearted women, something seemed to burst in my throat and bitter\r\ntears streamed from my tired eyes. I could not tell him _I_ was English.\r\nI could not find words or strength, such as came to me later in\r\nAnatolia, to plead a little for England by putting some of the blame on\r\nM. Venizelos.\r\n\r\nWhile the Italian discreetly left me—to kneel before an Ikon in silent\r\nprayer to the Man of Sorrows—I could but stand and suffer the attack\r\nupon my beloved country, choking with tears of humiliation.\r\n\r\nAlas, the incident does not stand alone. When taking tea in an hotel, I\r\nasked my companion to make inquiries about the best place to buy a Union\r\nJack, and the proprietor seized the opportunity to give us _his_ opinion\r\nof British honour.\r\n\r\nNow I never heard, throughout the whole of Anatolia, a single Turk speak\r\nof Britain or Mr. Lloyd George as these Greeks both spoke. It is a pity\r\nthat some of our pro-Greek politicians were not with me—to learn the\r\n_real_ value of all they have undertaken for their Christian brethren.\r\n\r\nIn that church, maybe, I was so cruelly overcome because the\r\nbroken-hearted women had stirred in me a glowing vision of the great\r\nPericles. “For me,” was his proud boast, “shall no man wear mourning. I\r\nhave not shed one drop of human blood.” Could any ruler leave this earth\r\nwith a nobler record? Could any conceive for himself so fine an epitaph?\r\n\r\n_Our_ rulers, and Venizelos, have wasted the precious blood of Europe to\r\nflatter their personal vanity and nurse an idle imperialism for Greece;\r\nand when everything goes wrong they have only to resign!\r\n\r\nI had determined to ascend the Acropolis, whatever the effort to reach\r\nthe top, and refused even to be discouraged when at the very entrance\r\nour driver pulled up and informed us that “it was forbidden” to drive\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\nIt did not occur to me to protest; but we had scarcely walked twenty\r\nyards up the steep ascent when a carriage (containing the captain and\r\nhis daughter) and then another carriage (!) drove by. Naturally\r\nindignant, we returned to ask the man what he meant. To evade argument,\r\nhe disingenuously explained: “It would need two horses to get up there,\r\nand I have only one.” The subterfuge only infuriated me the more, and\r\nwhen he had six times sturdily refused to obey orders, I simply seized\r\nthe miserable little being by the shoulders and shook him like a rat.\r\nViolence proved the only way, and we had no more trouble with him!\r\n\r\nIt is horrible, in such hallowed surroundings, to be haggling about\r\nmoney; but, of course, we were cheated over our change!\r\n\r\n“Never mind,” said the Italian, “let the creatures rob us. Gentlemen\r\ncannot fight with grooms.” And as I looked at the exquisite profile of\r\nthis young Venetian against the Athenian skies, I could fancy myself\r\naccompanied by one of the old Patricians, amidst his degenerate,\r\nmoney-changing descendants.\r\n\r\nAlmost in silence we wandered over the ruins of a civilisation whence\r\ncame the highest culture of the world. I felt, indeed, as if I had been\r\nborn too late; for what have _I_ in common with the century in which I\r\nlive?\r\n\r\nTo-day nations are not judged by their lyrics that are the measure of\r\ntheir imagination, and without imagination the race must die. Our\r\nstandards are skill in commerce!\r\n\r\nHad I the art, whether of pen or brush, to pay fit homage to this\r\nimmortal rock, who would look or listen? Could I invent yet one more\r\nmachine to “save time”—for making more money—the world would be at my\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nWhere shall _we_ look for a Pericles, who hand our laurels to the\r\npresiding genius of a “cash and carry” _store_?\r\n\r\nThere is no finer view of Athens than one can gain from the Acropolis,\r\nas the city lies at its feet, like some plain of brown paper dotted with\r\ngreen palms and the little white houses drawn in chalk.\r\n\r\n“Here,” said I, “is the Greece of Oxford—of Homer and Plato, of Æschylus\r\nand of Sophocles! The magnificent traditions of an immortal past.\r\n\r\n“It was in Oxford of classic memories, that I first heard the Tales of\r\nGreece, first listened to her great scholars telling of Andromache and\r\nAntigone in the exquisite language of the finest literature in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n“Here, too, is the Greece of Byron—of Childe Harold, and of the _Maid of\r\nAthens_!”\r\n\r\nHow the voice carries in this clear atmosphere! No wonder these ancient\r\npeople would crowd under the blue skies to every play, tragic or comic,\r\nthat their great dramatists could produce.\r\n\r\nAnd now, as the sunset colours—gold, scarlet, violet, and purple—are\r\nglowing upon the immortal rock, over the marble ruins, I marvel at\r\n“tiny” Athens and her “vast” name.\r\n\r\nAlas, for Hellas and modern Greece!\r\n\r\nHad her own people been as faithful as Oxford to the traditions of\r\nancient Greece, what would have been the Eastern Question to-day? And\r\nfor some, no doubt, it is this very honouring of Hellas that has been\r\nresponsible for our fatal pro-Greek enthusiasms. If we recognise the\r\nsuperiority of the modern Turk, loyalty to Plato, to Aristotle, and to\r\nSocrates must forbid speech; gratitude to the lyrcis of Hellas must tie\r\nthe tongue. Orators and poets, artists and thinkers cannot forget.\r\nHellas still lives and rules in the Republic of Letters and Art.\r\n\r\nWe understand Oxford; but for those who have been on the spot, facts\r\ntell another tale and speak with another voice. Where, in Greece to-day,\r\nare her men of intellect or imagination, even her aristocrats or her\r\nwarriors? The millions spent in propaganda may serve to prolong the\r\nlegend, they cannot alter facts. To visit, with glowing anticipations,\r\nthis land of our dreams, means the awakening to bitter disillusion.\r\nThose only are still blind who will not see.\r\n\r\nIn Angora I could but plead for England: “We have loved Helen; must we\r\ndivorce her?”\r\n\r\nMore than the eloquence of Venizelos, more than the gold of Zakaroff,\r\nmore than any pity for Christian martyrs; it is our age-old loyalty to\r\nthe civilisation to which we owe our visions and our ideals—that has led\r\nus so woefully and so wilfully astray. Is there not, after all, some\r\n“merit” in British “fair play” to a “lost cause?”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                    SMYRNA: A PICTURE OF DESOLATION\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR Orientals, the sky is no less variable and uncertain than the\r\npolitical horizon. In the space of an hour the sea, calm as a lake, has\r\nbeen transformed to a roaring torrent.\r\n\r\nSmyrna in the distance, and we are battling forward through one of the\r\nworst storms of the season. The steamer dances like a cork on the foam,\r\nwhile long sheets of rain drench the decks, huge waves washing into\r\nstaterooms soak the carpet, thunder and lightning rage overhead; as in\r\nthe grim battle of life, we can but hold on till the clouds pass.\r\n\r\nSoon, indeed, are the waters about us again at rest, and the town rises\r\nto our view. A city burnt to the ground? Where are the ruins of which we\r\nhave heard so much? Of a sudden the heavens answer.\r\n\r\nAs the lightning begins to play over the land, the “shells” of houses\r\nand their hollow interiors stand out clear before us—a picture of horror\r\nand desolation it would be hard to match. As we draw nearer it is no\r\nlonger necessary for us to gaze upon the devastation; the blind could\r\ncatch a strong smell of burning (not in itself disagreeable) and, in a\r\nfew moments, we see that even the rains have not entirely quenched the\r\nclouds of smoke still rising from the tobacco factories.\r\n\r\nTurkey considers herself at war, and red tape still prevails. But now\r\none does not find many Turks who can speak English, though, strange to\r\nrelate, there are quite a few English here still. We are not issuing\r\npassports to Turks!\r\n\r\nSeeing my Turkish letters (better these than a British passport), the\r\npassport officer sent his secretary with me and my luggage to the Vali’s\r\n(_i.e._ governor’s) house. The Angora Ambassador in Rome, Djelalledine\r\nArif Bey, had also telegraphed to the Vali that I was on my way, and\r\nrequested that, as some acknowledgment of what I had done for Turkey, I\r\nshould be given all possible facilities and a right royal welcome! The\r\nVali, without doubt, did all he could.\r\n\r\nI inquired of the officer what kind of man was the Vali, sure that the\r\nmeasure of his enthusiasm or his indifference would clearly reveal\r\nwhether the master was liked by his men and thus provide me with a peep\r\ninto the unknown. The man’s eyes positively lit up as he replied. It was\r\nclear that I should be well received by a good man. “He was sent to\r\nMalta, you know,” concluded the officer, as if that were enough. And,\r\nthough I was English, I understood. I believe that the word “Malta” may\r\nsoon be safely translated “patriot.”\r\n\r\nI suppose it needed some courage to come to Turkey, braving the Custom\r\nhouse and passport officers even with special “protection”; but I met\r\nwith no difficulties whatever. My companion only seemed puzzled by my\r\nname being the same as my father’s! A Turkish woman, of course, would\r\nbe, _e.g._, Aïché Hanoun, wife of Rechid Pasha, or daughter of Zia\r\nPasha. But have no foreign women, bearing their father’s name, been\r\nthrough the Smyrna customs, or am I not only the first British woman to\r\nvisit Angora, but the first British spinster to enter Turkey?\r\n\r\nSomething of all I owed to the Vali for his “speeding up” of the\r\ncustomary formalities was forcibly impressed on me when I went back for\r\nmy Turkish papers, to find one of my fellow-passengers, a Frenchman,\r\nstill struggling with his passport and the custom duties.\r\n\r\nThe Vali’s konak (or palace) which I had long known from pictures, looks\r\non to public gardens where the band plays every afternoon a strange\r\nmixture of Oriental and European music. It was delightful to hear\r\nOriental tunes again, if indeed one can call Oriental music _a tune_.\r\nAnything in the major key seems out of focus with Turkey, its\r\natmosphere, its scenery, and surroundings. The more one hears and\r\nunderstands the piercing melancholy of these refrains the more one loves\r\nthem; and I am particularly grateful to all those Turks (M. Kemal Pasha\r\nincluded) who entertained me with the true native work.\r\n\r\nIn front of the marble steps of the palace Greek flags are used as\r\nmats—dishonoured and trampled with Turkish mud! Such a symbol of\r\nconquest struck me as neither generous nor happy; but I soon found that\r\nit had been adopted without the knowledge of the chivalrous Vali, who\r\nimmediately put a stop to the custom.\r\n\r\nHis palace is lavishly supplied with fine carpets, always the chief item\r\nof furniture in the East, while there are many chairs and a handsome\r\ndesk in the waiting room.\r\n\r\n“Welcome to our shores, dear miss,” said the Vali.\r\n\r\nAnd that he might at once disassociate me from English policy, I\r\nreplied: “That is certainly a charming welcome from a Malta man.”\r\n\r\n“Malta to me,” said my host, as he took my hand like an old friend, “is\r\nstill incomprehensible. What can have happened to England?”\r\n\r\n“I understand it, dear Excellency, no better than you can. The more I\r\nhear of what has taken place in Turkey during the last few years, the\r\nmore often I repeat your own words. What, indeed? To an Englishwoman who\r\nloves her country, it means great sorrow; but this unreasoning hostility\r\ntowards your people must stop. That is why I am going to Angora. After\r\nmy visit, at any rate, the Turks shall see that _one_ Englishwoman can\r\nstand out against injustice.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you a thousand times, dear miss,” was his reply, as the attendant\r\nbrought in coffee and cigarettes.\r\n\r\nLike all the Nationalist leaders, the Vali is a young man. He looks, in\r\nfact, about forty, and comes from an Albanian family. Of medium height,\r\nslight and dark, good-looking despite his glasses, and intelligent; he\r\nis, above all, an honest and kindly gentleman. If all the “fanatics” of\r\nAngora are of this description, I shall have nothing to fear. Abdul\r\nHalik Bey is a great admirer of England.\r\n\r\nBegging I should not hesitate to ask for anything, assuring me that no\r\nservice possible to render will be neglected, he called up the head of\r\nthe police and three of his officers to make my acquaintance. The Vali\r\nexplains that as Smyrna is in ruins, I must go to the only existing\r\nhotel—a temporary establishment under the care of Naim Bey, who had been\r\nthe proprietor of the two best hotels in Smyrna, now burnt to the\r\nground. This “temporary establishment” was the town residence of the\r\nSpartallis and a very fine mansion indeed!\r\n\r\nWhen I had said _au revoir_ to the Vali, I paid my return visit to the\r\nchief of the police, Zia Bey—a handsome and very energetic young man of\r\nabout thirty-two, who speaks only Turkish.\r\n\r\nAgain we drank coffee. He pointed to the picture of M. Kemal Pasha above\r\nhis desk, and made a little speech about him, which, alas, I could not\r\nunderstand. As comment, however, I clapped my hands, adding: “M. Kemal\r\nPasha Chok Guzel” (_i.e._, very beautiful), which evidently pleased him.\r\nHe could see at least that my spirit was willing to pay tribute to his\r\nnational hero although the Turkish words failed me. Throughout Anatolia,\r\nwhenever at a loss for words, I adopted this phrase; never once did it\r\nfail to convey the meaning I intended—congratulations for his\r\nmagnificent victory.\r\n\r\nZia Bey has published some detective novels—from his own personal\r\nexperiences. Like the man himself, they seem to have secured wide\r\napplause.\r\n\r\nHe, too, like the Vali, is a stern enemy to delay, and often receives\r\nseveral people at once. He will listen to all you have to say, while the\r\nbusiness of an earlier caller is still to be executed. Practical and\r\ncourteous though such a custom may be, it obviously has its drawbacks. I\r\nwonder what would happen had I any advice to ask, or any suggestion to\r\nmake, on what to me at least might seem private and confidential\r\nmatters. Thanks to this system, however, it has been my privilege to\r\nmeet at the Vali’s, or at Zia Bey’s, many notables of Smyrna, whom I\r\nmight not have found time or occasion to visit.\r\n\r\nOne day when drinking my daily coffee with Zia Bey, he handed 20,000\r\nTurkish pounds to a French merchant. A policeman, he explained, “found\r\nthis in your rifled safe.” The merchant was so astonished that he spoke\r\nto me about it, adding: “Would they have been returned to me in any\r\nother land?”\r\n\r\nEvery day, after calling upon the Vali, I used to visit Zia Bey. To the\r\nVali, of course, I could speak in French, but to Zia Bey I seldom went\r\nfurther than a repetition of praise for M. Kemal Pasha. It is not words\r\nthat count when the heart is following the dictates of truth.\r\n\r\nAt the hotel I could only be accommodated by the dismissal of another\r\nguest. Men were sleeping everywhere—in the drawing-room, sitting-rooms,\r\nbedrooms, three, four, and six in a room, grateful to find anywhere to\r\nlay their heads. To my lot fell one of the best rooms in the house,\r\ncontaining a sofa as well as a bed large enough for four. I felt very\r\nguilty, but what could I do? I was the only woman!\r\n\r\nTo this improvised hotel everyone in Smyrna comes sooner or later, if\r\nnot for accommodation, at least for meals and “light” refreshment. The\r\ncountry, of course, is dry, but the guests walk round the laws as\r\ncleverly as they do in the U.S.A. Americans are, perhaps, the chief\r\noffenders, and seem always able to bring in with them whatever they\r\nrequire. If they are caught Naim has to pay the damages! “Poor things,”\r\nhe remarked by way of comment, “they are so far from their homes.”\r\n\r\nMost unfortunately, the Turk’s kindness and consideration for his\r\ncustomers is not withheld from the flies. The Nationalist motto, “A free\r\nand independent Turkey,” has certainly been granted them—they go\r\nwherever they like, do whatever they like. They sit in thick layers on\r\nthe table-cloth, they drown themselves in your glasses, you swallow them\r\nwith your food; “and to think,” said a Danish merchant, “these creatures\r\nhave been fattening on corpses!”\r\n\r\nWhatever their nationality, all my neighbours made the most chivalrous\r\nendeavours to shield me from these pests. I was advised to sacrifice my\r\nbread as a cover to my glass when not drinking. I always refused water,\r\nand Naim Bey defied the law to give me German wine.\r\n\r\nOne day, exasperated beyond endurance, I procured what the French call a\r\n“guillotine,” and successfully slaughtered every fly that came within my\r\nreach. The “Italian” gently inquired whether the corpses were not more\r\nawful than the living insects.\r\n\r\n“At least,” I said, “they cannot bite or carry microbes,” and I pursued\r\nthe slaughter with a zeal that astonished even myself. I even aimed at\r\nthose I saw walking over the South American’s arm, and hit his nose!\r\nWithout a smile, he courteously declared that he did not mind what I\r\nmight do to his nose, “but you _will_ be careful of my glasses, won’t\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“Can’t you _do_ something?” I asked Naim one day.\r\n\r\n“They will go away when it is cold,” he replied with the philosophy of\r\nthe true Turk.\r\n\r\n“Cure or endure is also _my_ motto,” I told him, smiling, “but I never\r\nendure before I’ve made a fine attempt to cure.”\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, my energies were not rewarded with true _Christian_\r\ngratitude or tact. I was busy as usual, when an orthodox lady who had\r\ngiven her nationality as “Catholic,” and was staying in Smyrna by\r\nspecial dispensation of the Turks, said to a Greek neighbour: “Look at\r\nthis lady slaughtering flies, as her friends the Turks slaughter\r\nChristians.”\r\n\r\n“Madame,” said I, “I have passed this morning among the ruins to which\r\nyour ‘Christians’ have reduced this city.” I had yet to see the hideous\r\ndevastation in Anatolia!\r\n\r\nThere were about two or three hundred business men in the hotel, waiting\r\nto learn their fate. They divided themselves into three distinct groups,\r\nin three different mess rooms. _First_, the silent, water-drinking,\r\ngo-to-bed-at-nine Turks, in the library. _Secondly_, Americans, in the\r\nsmoking-room, who left their allegiance to prohibition on the other side\r\nof the Atlantic; singing and dancing to the accompaniment of a banjo\r\ntill the small hours of the morning. _Thirdly_, at a long table in the\r\ndining-room, sat the rest of us—principally business men—Italian,\r\nSpanish, Dutch, South American, Frenchmen, or Danes. My only\r\nfellow-countryman informed me that among other complications he had come\r\nto Smyrna to arrange, he has somehow to explain away the disappearance\r\nof 50,000 gallons of pure alcohol, sent from Cuba to Smyrna _via_ New\r\nYork. The officials in New York had helped themselves to the precious\r\nnectar, and sent the cargo on to Smyrna, refilled with water! Such are\r\nthe trials of prohibition!\r\n\r\nOne and all, these men have but three topics of conversation: (1) the\r\nsenseless policy of Mr. Lloyd George in sending the Greeks to Smyrna;\r\n(2) the criminal desire of the Turks to abolish capitulations; (3) the\r\n“probabilities” of likely successors to the deported Greeks and\r\nArmenians in the business world. It is assumed that Turkey cannot\r\nsurvive without the assistance of some European power. The Turk is a\r\nproducer, not a merchant. The Italians affirm that trade would flourish\r\nin a happier world if they were given the vacancy. The Americans,\r\nhowever, dispute this honour, whilst the Dutchman, supported by a Dutch\r\nclergyman (born of French parents, but a British subject, in the service\r\nof Holland, speaking all three languages without an accent), declares\r\nthe only power that is “going to count” in Turkey is Great Britain.\r\n\r\n“In spite of her deplorable and ill-advised policy, her inexplicable\r\ntreatment of the Turks, her protection of the Greeks (which has made\r\n_them_ more arrogant and destestable than ever), there is _something_ in\r\nthe British national character which still commands respect and\r\nadmiration. In six or eight months we shall see England back in Turkey,\r\nstronger than ever. England is _not_ her government.”\r\n\r\nI believe he is right. There was a more practical reason for his\r\nconvictions than his deep affection for his English wife.\r\n\r\nHolding no brief for Mr. Lloyd George, I still scorn these men of\r\nfinance as cowards for their unmeasured abuse of the Premier.\r\n\r\n“If you foresaw disaster so plainly,” I asked, “why did you not\r\nprotest?”\r\n\r\n“Every Chamber of Commerce sent a petition to Mr. Lloyd George,” was the\r\nreply, “which he put into his waste-basket.”\r\n\r\n“Naturally. As practical men, is that your idea of a _protest_?”\r\n\r\n“One of our biggest men, Mr. Patterson, went to the Paris Conference on\r\nour behalf.”\r\n\r\n“Did he make himself heard? I assure you, if I had _one_ hundred pounds\r\ninvested in this country, instead of the hundreds of thousands your\r\nScotsman holds, the world would have heard something of _my_ visit to\r\nParis!\r\n\r\n“You saw financial disaster and ruin ahead, yet allowed yourselves to be\r\ntalked into silence by M. Venizelos!”\r\n\r\nSomehow, _these_ men could not excite my pity. They were themselves more\r\nto blame than Mr. Lloyd George. With their huge financial backing, and\r\nvast interests in Smyrna, it was actually in their power, and theirs\r\nalone, to have kept out the Greeks.\r\n\r\nIt is a quaint result of my sense of justice that, in the French Secret\r\nService, I am known as “a niece of Mr. Lloyd George.” When the brilliant\r\none-time _chef de Cabinet_ of Monsieur Briand published his violent\r\nattacks on Lord Robert Cecil and our late Premier, he also printed my\r\nreplies. “He did not,” he kindly explained, “consider there was a word\r\nof truth in what I said, but he was unwilling to thwart an\r\nEnglishwoman!”\r\n\r\nShortly after the appearance of my “defence,” the correspondent of a big\r\nnewspaper in Chicago spoke of “my uncle,” Mr. Lloyd George. I protested,\r\n“not because I should not be proud of the relationship, but because I\r\nhappen to have no such claim.”\r\n\r\n“Dear lady,” he replied, “don’t think I shall ever want to spoil your\r\nlittle game.”\r\n\r\nSuch a remark did not merit a serious answer, and I allowed the matter\r\nto slide. I knew very well Mr. Lloyd George would never lift a finger to\r\nhelp “his niece,” for have I not four times appealed to him in vain on\r\nmatters of the greatest national importance? Yet “his niece” will\r\ncontinue to defend him against “unjust” attacks, and criticise him also.\r\n\r\nThe Smyrna capitalists also did not love me because I wrote: “The day is\r\npast when financiers can obtain ‘concessions’ for 500 Turkish pounds\r\nbackshish and then complain of the Turks for being amenable to bribes.\r\nThe happy day will never return when the foreigner lived in Turkey\r\nwithout taxation, with next to nothing to pay in rent, was charged one\r\nand sixpence for a shooting licence, and had full control of money and\r\ntrade.”\r\n\r\n“Turkey is now for the Turks, and the Capitalists will have to recognise\r\nthis or leave.\r\n\r\n“Never again will Smyrna become the Aliens’ Paradise it once was. Would\r\nanyone, for example, have dared to offer the trams provided for Smyrna\r\nto any other nation but Turkey? Why were there not electric trams,\r\ninstead of these wretched horse-boxes drawn by underfed ponies? And the\r\ncompartment reserved for Turkish women was not even separated by a\r\npartition, but by a sheet that once perhaps was white!\r\n\r\n“There are men in this town,” I wrote, “who would plunge Europe into\r\nwar, to bring back the dear old lazy-going Turk who made so charming a\r\nbackground for our novels and plays. They would restore him for no\r\nhigher purpose than to fill their purses at his expense.” At least, I\r\nsaid to these merchants: “If you cannot ‘love’ my whip, you know, in\r\nyour heart of hearts, that I have spoken the truth. You should have a\r\nmighty respect for me, and I ask for nothing more.” The South American\r\nanswered: “Every word you say _is_ true, and we _all_ admire you for\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nTowards nightfall, however, my mind was occupied by certain more\r\npersonal anxieties. The Italian had not yet even come to the hotel, and\r\nI could hear nothing of him. I began to reproach myself with not having\r\nattempted to extend the protection of my papers to him, although, like\r\nthe gentleman he is, he had already refused my suggestion to that\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nI could only apply, as a last resource, to the Vali’s secretary, who at\r\nonce took me to the Caracol (_i.e._, the “lock-up”), where we found my\r\nfriend in company with the Frenchman we had already been pitying for his\r\nstruggles with passports. Neither of these young men were known in\r\nSmyrna; neither of them had secured permission from Angora to land;\r\nneither of them were personally known to their Consuls; neither of them\r\nwere able to speak a word of Turkish. They could not explain themselves,\r\nand were, therefore, to be kept under arrest till further inquiries\r\ncould be made.\r\n\r\n“After all, in war-time did we not do worse things than this?” I asked\r\nthe enraged Frenchman, who was declaring such treatment would make a\r\n_casus belli_.\r\n\r\n“When I was serving your country and travelling to San Remo with a\r\nspecial letter of recommendation from the French Minister of War, I was\r\ndetained for forty-eight hours at Mentone, because they considered my\r\n‘Plato’s Republic’ a proof of sympathy with the Bolshevists.” I was\r\nable, however, with the secretary’s willing assistance, to liberate both\r\nmy fellow-passengers without further delay.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNaim Bey gave me many special privileges, no doubt as the result of\r\nprompting from the same quarter. He sent me up breakfast in the\r\nmornings, though his servants were all “Catholics” (_i.e._, Armenians,\r\nunder the Papal protection), and did not know their job. I never could\r\nunderstand how he contrived to supply me with milk, as the Greeks had\r\nkilled most of the cows; but I was no less heartily grateful for his\r\npermission to use the Spartelli library, and for the reading-lamp which\r\nhe borrowed for me from an American.\r\n\r\nAll these acts of kindness, however, were done with such an appearance\r\nof ease that I even ventured upon one more request.\r\n\r\n“Could I use the piano to accompany my Italian friend?”\r\n\r\nHe did not hesitate to banish the six occupants of “mattresses” in the\r\ndrawing-room from their domain until we finished “La Tosca” and “Madame\r\nButterfly.” Then an American begged me to play the “Swannee River,” and\r\nnearly broke down before he had even got to the chorus.\r\n\r\n“Did I not tell you,” said the sympathetic Naim, “Poor things, they are\r\nso far away from home!”\r\n\r\nI suppose I should not be too severe upon these merchants among the\r\nruins of their past glory, and, to do them justice, they are accepting\r\ndefeat like good sportsmen. The Dutchman is as merry as a cricket,\r\ndespite his £80,000 “gone west,” his thirty years’ work undone for ever,\r\nhis fine farm burnt to cinders.\r\n\r\nI wish he would make a book out of all he has seen and done in this land\r\nof romance. No one knows it better, and, if my own sympathies are apt to\r\nbe with the brigands from whom he has twice suffered capture (because\r\nthey only rob the rich), I have enjoyed few men’s tales of adventure\r\nmore than his. Good and strong men are rare enough, and I know this one\r\nwould never forget a friend. If danger threatened, it would only reach\r\nyou over his dead body.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n               BRITISH CHIVALRY!—BRAVE WOMEN A NUISANCE!\r\n\r\n\r\n“WOMEN are so absurdly brave,” said a charming British official, “that\r\nis why they are such a nuisance.”\r\n\r\nHe was seated at a small, improvised and over-crowded bureau in one of\r\nthe few remaining houses on the Smyrna Quay. He had just sufficient of a\r\nScotch accent to make one see that he would stand no nonsense—an asset,\r\nsurely, in his position. Yet the obvious and zealous concern for his own\r\ncountrywoman proved that, however carefully the calm exterior of the\r\nScot may hide his feelings, his heart beats strong and true. He is no\r\nless proud, too, of his “women” than any citizen of the States!\r\n\r\nBut this able and active young man, master of any emergency at a crisis,\r\ncould not accept my point of view about the Nationalist Turk. That,\r\ncertainly, was not _his_ fault, for who is there to interpret this “new”\r\npeople to him? He only knows that, for the first time, Turks have dared\r\nto express themselves, and—like brave women—are becoming a great\r\nnuisance! Under the good Hamid, these lazy people were easy enough to\r\nmanage. “Turkey for the Turks!” What a monstrous notion! Yet one feels,\r\nnay knows, that he has plenty of intelligence, will face facts, and\r\nlearn to accept the inevitable.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I, for my part, am throwing a most unwelcome additional\r\nweight upon his already over-burdened shoulders. He is clearly annoyed\r\nat my having come so far, and, in his place, who would not have felt the\r\nsame?\r\n\r\nBut, unfortunately for him, he knows very well that a woman who, despite\r\ndifficulties well-nigh insurmountable, has been able to reach Smyrna\r\nwithout a British viza, means to get her way and will not be lightly\r\ndriven back.\r\n\r\nIf only the man had adopted the bullying and supercilious tone that\r\nbecomes a uniform! One can so easily meet the “correct” officialism,\r\ncounter its attacks, stand up to its incivility, and go one’s own way\r\nwith a clear conscience. But it was not to be with my Scotch friend.\r\n\r\n“I admire your courage immensely,” he said with a courteous grace, “but,\r\npardon my asking, what is the sense of it all?”\r\n\r\n“I want to study ‘the movement’ at Angora, and to see the national hero,\r\nM. Kemal Pasha.”\r\n\r\n“Is it worth risking your life for that? Forgive me, it does seem rather\r\na wicked waste.”\r\n\r\nOutside his windows, on the calm waters of the bay, rode warships of\r\nmany nations. The bright sun looked down, unkindly it almost seemed,\r\nupon the ruin and desolation around us. The arms of England, France and\r\nAmerica were all there. Holland, he told me, had begged in terror for\r\nthe protection of a warship.\r\n\r\n“Terror of what?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Have you not heard, can you not see, we are on the brink of war?\r\nTo-morrow you will be going home with the others. Our Government has\r\ngiven orders for the immediate evacuation of all our people. Later you\r\nwill receive final instructions, and be told the meeting-place. This\r\ntime it is war. There is no help for it. It has to come.”\r\n\r\nHe showed me a flashlight, well hidden in a corner of that dilapidated\r\noffice, which would send out its news of “safety” when every Englishman\r\nhad left the town, and he, my friend, had followed them in a boat with\r\nits oars muffled—if he were able to get away. If not, well, he had done\r\nhis duty!\r\n\r\nBut I remained unmoved. “Do not worry about me. I have made all my\r\nplans, and shall start to-morrow for Angora. I know the risks, and I\r\nknow, too, that all will be well for me.”\r\n\r\nAt first, evidently, his official mind suspected that I was playing with\r\nhis nerves, idly boasting of what no one would seriously attempt. When\r\nconvinced, however, that I really meant what I said, he banged his fist\r\non the table and just shouted:\r\n\r\n“By Jove, if you belonged to me, you should _not go_.”\r\n\r\nHow I hoped he had lost his temper! But no, in another moment he was\r\nagain all quiet concern, courteously persuasive.\r\n\r\n“But,” said I, “I have reached here against long odds. I have come\r\nentirely on my own responsibility, and at my own expense. The Turks who\r\nmet me here will take care of me, not my family nor my Government. Even\r\nwar will not stop me.”\r\n\r\n“And when there is war,” he replied, with a note of almost despairing\r\nentreaty, “for as there is a God above, it will come this time. Think of\r\nit! A woman absolutely alone among the Turks; not a European to help\r\nher. Six months, at least, in a concentration camp, illness, perhaps\r\ntorture. God knows what will happen to you!”\r\n\r\n“I shall not be put into a concentration camp, for there will be no war.\r\nI am going to stop it!”\r\n\r\nI was smiling now, which only added to his distress.\r\n\r\n“My dear young lady,” he cried, “keep your courage for some wiser, finer\r\ncause. Britain needs you.... Seriously, you are not going, are you?—And\r\nthe war!”\r\n\r\n“I shall nurse the British soldiers, or else return——”\r\n\r\n“You speak of the Turks as if you trusted them. Is this wise?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, yes. I know them. The only way to treat a Turk _is_ to trust\r\nhim. He has never yet let me down. Why should he now? Even at this\r\ncrisis you will find there is no other way but trust with the Moslem.”\r\n\r\nOf course he was not convinced.\r\n\r\n“Charming theories, but dangerous in practice; above all, dangerous for\r\nyou. Go home. You can see your friends again when things are more\r\nsettled. Don’t think I don’t admire your pluck; I do. In all my\r\nexperience I never met a woman ready for greater risk; but we value you\r\ntoo much to let you go.”\r\n\r\nIt was a wearisome line of attack. I could so much more easily have\r\ndealt with violence from a would-be dictator. I tried again, hoping to\r\nsilence a busy man.\r\n\r\n“Please imagine you are an American,” I suggested, “and that time is\r\nmoney.”\r\n\r\n“Time is _not_ money when a woman’s life is at stake. Forgive me, your\r\ncourage—which I shall never forget—is immense, but you are not a\r\nsportsman!”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“It is not fair to us—Englishmen! What will the Turks think of us,\r\nallowing it? They will have a mighty poor opinion of British chivalry.\r\nAnd we do not deserve it! Would they let one of _their_ women do such a\r\nthing? We, too, protect our women!”\r\n\r\nI was losing ground, at least _that_ appeal hurt; but I could not yield.\r\n\r\n“You need not worry,” I replied, with more unconcern than I could really\r\nfeel at the moment. “I will see that they understand. They _do_ know how\r\nEngland cares for her women; but they know me, what a determined\r\ncustomer I am. They will not blame you.”\r\n\r\nHe played his last card, bashfully indeed, but with a grim resolve that\r\nwon my respect.\r\n\r\n“Dear lady, I have no wish to be personal, but you have driven me to it.\r\nYou are not—ugly enough to undertake this journey.... Go and see the\r\nBritish Navy you love so much. We will look after the Turks, and you\r\ntoo. Come and see them when we have finished with them.”\r\n\r\nI saw that I must not only be firm, but I must speak, and speak plainly.\r\n“If any harm comes of it,” I said, seriously enough, God knows, “it will\r\nbe my own fault. The Turk respects women who respect themselves. Ten\r\nyears ago I went to Asia Minor, with a military escort, the only woman;\r\nbut I was absolutely safe all the time, everywhere.”\r\n\r\nThere was no more to be said. Discomfited, indeed, by so much chivalry,\r\nI left him, intending, after all, to wait and see if war were declared.\r\nBut, fortunately, I had given no promise, for to the Scotchman I knew\r\ntruth and honour were sacred things.\r\n\r\nIn justice to the official attitude, it should be clearly said that no\r\none could be expected to understand what I should have given up had I\r\nreturned to England, under orders, with the rest of my compatriots.\r\n\r\nWhat, after all, were the difficulties that I had overcome in comparison\r\nwith my real object—to reach Angora? What matter if the family coffers,\r\nthe purses of my friends, and even editorial generosity, were one and\r\nall closed against me? None should have on their conscience that they\r\nhad sent me to my death!\r\n\r\nMy contract with the newspaper! It was “deliver the goods and your\r\nreward shall be handsome.” The goods, indeed, are delivered and, in a\r\nfashion, made public. They have not, however, been acknowledged as\r\n“woman’s work,” and the reward seems still far to seek!\r\n\r\nI had not supposed that in journalism “the sex” must suffer the double\r\nloss of justice and credit. The articles were certainly not stamped with\r\nany plain mark of a _feminine_ special correspondent.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we are not in Turkey! where women’s achievements have\r\nstill the “novelty” that can command a fine flourish of trumpets, where\r\nno cry has been needed of “equal work—equal pay!”\r\n\r\nHad I foreseen, should I then have returned to punish ingratitude? I\r\nthink not. At such a moment I could not forego the most thrilling\r\nchapter of the story that has held me for so many years; ever since,\r\nindeed, I used to climb on the knee of the dear being whose name I bear,\r\nto hear him tell of his journeyings to those Eastern lands—Japan and\r\nChina, India and Moslem Turkey.\r\n\r\nMany curious interpretations have been put upon my interest in these\r\npeoples. The Turks themselves have wondered how it came about.\r\n\r\nIt is because they had been my friends long years before I ever set foot\r\non their now familiar land. Its colours, its beauty, its glorious\r\nsummers and sunsets, the fine thought and philosophy of its high-minded,\r\nsober people, were known to me in the nursery, as only a child can live\r\nin the imaginations stirred by those it loves. They were always brothers\r\nto me, the Orientals of India and Persia, Egypt, Arabia, and Turkey. I\r\nwould give much, indeed, to secure for them the happiness they deserve\r\nfor what they have given to the culture and to the civilisation of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe stupidity of treating the Asiatic as an “inferior” I could never\r\nunderstand. It is no less impolitic than unjust. What a delight, in our\r\ncentury of semi-tones and of commercialism, to talk with men like\r\nTagore!\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n         SMYRNA—GOD’S WORK—THE EXQUISITE SUNSET—MAN’S WORK—WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nI TAKE daily walks in Smyrna, with one of the Vali’s officers, chiefly\r\namong the ruins. The European part of the town (save for a few houses on\r\nthe quay and a few hospitals, schools, and churches) has simply ceased\r\nto exist. The empty “shells” of what were once fine streets are a great\r\ndanger to passers-by and must all be blasted.\r\n\r\nWhen I told my guide that from the deck of the _Pierre Loti_ the town\r\nshowed scarcely a sign of fire, he promptly led me—for eight\r\nhours—through the most horrible _débris_! Instructed to treat me with\r\ngreat respect, he marched steadily ahead with all the gravity of a\r\nfuneral mute. He had been told, moreover, to reconstruct, as it were,\r\nthe whole city for my information, and he was obviously determined to\r\noverlook no detail. He pointed out exactly how the fire had been\r\nplanned, and why it had broken out too soon. Passing the Stores, he laid\r\na finger upon the very spots marked by grenades that Greeks and\r\nArmenians had thrown. There was a grim disgust and disdain in his last\r\ncomment: “And all this _funniness_ is supposed to have been done _by\r\nus_!”—a strange use of the word funniness.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, resting a moment among the ruins of what had once\r\nbeen an altar, watching the poor Turkish natives as they raked the\r\n_débris_ for firewood, we were suddenly surrounded by a most dismal\r\nprocession of limping cats and dogs, thin as boards, crying with hunger\r\nand pain, homeless, maimed, and with none to claim them or cherish their\r\nshrunken limbs. I suggested that we should buy a little ether and send\r\nthem to their long sleep. My companion was shocked beyond words.\r\n\r\n“Poor beasts,” he exclaimed, “have not they as much right to be on God’s\r\nearth as we? Who are we that we should dare to cut short their\r\nexistence?”\r\n\r\nNaturally I did what I could to express all the sympathy his words\r\naroused; determining, nevertheless, in my own mind, that I would beg the\r\nEnglishman or the Italian to accomplish this errand of mercy.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the incident only further excited my deep interest in\r\nthe strange mentality of a people who claim the full rights of existence\r\neven for maimed cats and dogs, and are yet held guilty by the whole\r\nworld of massacring millions of Christians for mere sport.\r\n\r\nLater that day I was for the moment extremely puzzled by the strange\r\nbehaviour of all the inhabitants within sight, which certainly seemed\r\nmost _un_-Turkish. “I have known your people for fifteen years,” I said\r\n(only intending a mild joke), “and this is the first time I have ever\r\nseen a Turk hurry! What is the matter?”\r\n\r\n“They are going to blast the ruins,” was my companion’s calm reply.\r\n\r\nTo my thinking it was, indeed, time to be off; and I hopped away like\r\nthe others, in and out among the charred ruins, at one moment catching\r\nmy heel, at another tearing my skirt and coat. When, panting and\r\nbreathless, we at last reached comparative safety, I laughingly asked my\r\nguide why he had given me no warning. “You could have no idea whether I\r\ncould run like this at the last moment.”\r\n\r\n“His Excellency told me that you were to be treated with the utmost\r\nrespect,” was the solemn reply!\r\n\r\nIt was true that the day before I had been informed that it was\r\nforbidden to take photographs among the ruins, and I at once closed my\r\nKodak. But in the evening an apology arrived from the Chief of\r\nPolice.:—“I might photograph, when and where I pleased.”\r\n\r\nI can only suppose my guide believed that “Allah would guard me” when\r\nthe blasting began; at least, whatever was to be my fate, he was ready\r\nto share it!\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have been wandering about the muddy streets of the bazaar,\r\nimmortalised by Pierre Loti. It is here, in these little Turkish\r\nbooths—the tinker’s, tailor’s, and shoemaker’s, the meat-man’s, the\r\nbaker’s, and the sweet-seller’s—that the inhabitants of Smyrna must do\r\ntheir shopping to-day. How can we think of Frank Street and its vast\r\nEuropean “emporium,” now no more than a smouldering heap of crumbling\r\nruins?\r\n\r\nTown-planning is as yet unknown in Turkey. Here, as elsewhere, the\r\nhouses seem to be straggling upon the hillside, forming an architectural\r\npatchwork far more picturesque than the most correct symmetry.\r\n\r\nWe are now to ascend Mont Pegasus, and though I hate climbing, the\r\nsunset panorama of an Eastern city will reward a greater effort than\r\nthis. To look on the fading sunlight in all its glorious magnificence of\r\npurple and scarlet and mauve, is to know we are in the presence of God;\r\nand if ever the world needed His guidance, it surely must seek Him now.\r\n\r\n“That,” I murmured, “is how God meant us to find His world—a life of\r\nsunshine, a death of beauty. No fear, no shrinking before what must come\r\nto all; but His glory reflected about us, as the sun’s beauty is reborn\r\nfor us in the infinite, waiting sea.\r\n\r\n“Look up, and then turn your eyes down to man’s work below our\r\nfeet—black war, grey ruin and desolation!”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn English lady, Mrs. de C——, the widow of a distinguished British\r\nMinister in Teheran and Bucharest, has just given me a more level-headed\r\nand _fair_ description of the Smyrna fire than I have yet heard from any\r\nother eye-witness. Her husband was manager of the Aidin Railway, and had\r\nthe luck to unearth a unique collection of priceless antiques along the\r\nroute. Tea was served in the entrance hall of their house in the\r\nEuropean quarter, one of the few still erect, which reminded me of the\r\nBritish Museum. One could fancy oneself among the treasures of the\r\nParthenon, which it has fallen to British hands to preserve.\r\n\r\nShe told me she owed her home to the wind’s kindness. “We were on the\r\nroof all night, watching its varying directions, although it did not\r\ncome our way until about 2.30 A.M. As the abandoned Greek ammunition was\r\nall stored behind us, we could no longer risk staying in the face of the\r\nwind. At the same moment a flashlight from H.M.S. _Iron Duke_ began to\r\nplay on the pier, and we realised that Admiral de Brock was signalling\r\nfor us to leave the town. Pushing our way through a howling mob of men\r\nand animals, we at last reached the waiting boat; but no sooner were we\r\non board than, to our relief, the wind once more veered. There was a\r\nchance for one side of the Smyrna Quay, on which stood the Aidin\r\nstation.”\r\n\r\nIn her judgment, the Turks acted throughout with the greatest\r\nmoderation. Everywhere in Anatolia I found clear evidence that Greeks\r\nhad indulged in the worst type of barbarianism, amply sufficient to\r\njustify any slight Turkish excesses that may have occurred in Smyrna.\r\n\r\nSince her Greek household had all departed, Mrs. de C—— was very busy\r\n“about many things”—dusting, sweeping, and cooking. Nor were her\r\nsympathies very keen with the Greek refugees, to many of whom she had\r\nextended hospitality. They had accepted a night’s lodging, and then\r\ndecamped with sheets, blankets, pillows, towels, and clothes!\r\n\r\nLunch, however, had been served for her by a “Catholic,” who cooked\r\nTurkish dishes to perfection. “Catholic” is now the last word in\r\n“Nationality,” covering a multitude of “pasts,” and saving the\r\n“Christian” from having to answer awkward questions.\r\n\r\nThe “Catholic” who waits on me at the hotel was an upholsterer in quite\r\na large way of business. The sewing-woman, whom I have occasionally\r\nemployed for odd jobs, though a Greek, is also “Catholic.” In Angora\r\nthese derelicts are self-styled “Catholic Turks.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have boarded the warship, despite the captain’s fear of a woman’s pen.\r\nWhat would he find to say about my _real_ intentions? Most of us,\r\nhappily, can look on sailors of all nations, as I do, absolutely without\r\nprejudice. For here, at least, none can capture our laurels, and all the\r\nworld loves a British sailor.\r\n\r\nAmidst the beautiful fittings of his luxurious cabin, I was received by\r\nthe captain with every mark of the courtesy that is second nature to the\r\nreal English gentleman. He was a naval man to his finger-tips, stamped\r\nall over with Nelson’s magic call to “Duty.” For his magnificent\r\nachievements in the war, his V.C. was indeed richly deserved; and yet, I\r\nwondered, is it the wisest policy to expose this _real_ “personage” to\r\nthe kind of actually trivial irregularities which in a town like Smyrna\r\na too formal officialism may so easily mistake for grave affronts to our\r\nnational prestige?\r\n\r\nWhile in Smyrna I saw an example of such real dangers—a mere nothing\r\nthat might suddenly have developed into a _casus belli_, though in this\r\ncase any serious disaster was, luckily, averted.\r\n\r\nThe Turks had given the sailors from different warships special\r\npermission to land on the quay without the formality of going through\r\nthe Custom House. Unfortunately, certain Armenian girls saw their chance\r\nto coax the sailormen into helping them to escape. I am told that the\r\nBritish were adamant to tales of woe that turned Americans, French, and\r\nItalians to putty; but I will not believe it, for I prefer to think our\r\nmen had their share in defying the law to help women.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish authorities, however, were, naturally and properly,\r\nindignant at the deception, and gave orders that in future everyone\r\nshould land at the Custom House. Most unfortunately, the order was\r\nimmediately carried out, without a warning to the captain. When that\r\npersonage came ashore next morning, therefore, he found himself\r\nconfronted by an Anatolian peasant, rifle in hand, who actually slipped\r\nin an extra cartridge under the great man’s eye.\r\n\r\nOur consul, of course, intervened, and the captain, with his sword\r\ndrawn, was permitted to land, ample apologies being tendered in due\r\ncourse by a repentant Vali.\r\n\r\nNo more was heard of this incident; but with some “big” men it would not\r\nhave been allowed to end there.\r\n\r\nI admit that a warning should have reached the captain; but Turks are\r\nproverbially careless about official details. It was just bad luck, too,\r\nthat some petty officer was not the first to land, who could have borne\r\nthe indignity without loss of prestige, and “arranged” matters for his\r\nchief; but if we must appoint our “best” men to such a post, someone\r\nsmaller should be sent in advance to spy out the land. Friction is bound\r\nto occur between our experienced officers, statesmen, or diplomats\r\n(above all, if their sense of humour is not very keen) and the primitive\r\nAnatolians of young Turkey. We should, surely, have been well advised in\r\nthis matter to follow the French way of employing “middle men” for a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nI love the casual freedom of Turkish customs, which will suffer a train\r\nto be kept waiting for my private comfort; but the characteristic may be\r\nextremely trying on another occasion. Every virtue has its pet vice!\r\n\r\nWhen I visited Turkey after the Balkan war our steamer somehow “missed”\r\nthe mouth of the bay, and no one remembered the exact position of the\r\nmines! As a matter of fact, the _Senegal_ was blown to atoms only a few\r\ndays ahead, and our own escape was pure luck. There was considerable\r\nalarm on board, and I was once more filled with gratitude for my own\r\nsmall share of the fatalism of the Turk!\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, for my own private benefit, I could also have wished\r\nthat our captain had been a “smaller” man, or one less scrupulously\r\ncompact of duty. When I admitted that I had really come on board in\r\nsearch of a British flag, no matter how torn and tattered, he only\r\nlooked at me as though I were mad.\r\n\r\n“You don’t seem to know much about the inner workings of the navy,” was\r\nall he _said_.\r\n\r\n“One does not bother about the ‘inner workings’ of anything one loves,”\r\nI answered.\r\n\r\nSo with the gravest courtesy he explained to me that a new flag could\r\nnot possibly be obtained until the “tattered” one had been handed over\r\nto H.Q. Nevertheless I believe that a French, Italian, or even an\r\nAmerican, captain would have contrived some means of acceding to my\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\nAs it happens, I once saw the man off his guard. He was playing the host\r\nto a beautiful Englishwoman and her French husband, his neighbours on\r\ntheir own yacht, and no one could have seemed more naturally genial and\r\nlight-hearted, with his really delightful sense of humour. Is it\r\n_necessary_ for a uniform to conceal all traces of humanity? Why could\r\nnot the world see the man’s best side in the officer? The strictest\r\nsense of “fair play,” combined with great patience, will work even\r\nbetter with the Turks when added to a generous supply of smiles and wit.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the Vali sent word that all was ready for me to proceed on my way\r\nto Angora, I could not hesitate. Whatever my compatriots may have said,\r\nand would, no doubt, have now repeated with greater emphasis, I could\r\nnot think of having allowed him to take so much trouble on my account\r\nfor nothing!\r\n\r\nAbove all, particularly towards a Moslem, the last thing that any lady\r\ncould think of doing would be to betray the slightest lack of trust.\r\nWhat matter if we were on the brink of war? It simply never entered my\r\nhead that I could really come to any harm from the Turks!\r\n\r\nIt is of interest, nevertheless, to put on record the various, not\r\naltogether unreasonable, warnings that I received at the hotel in Smyrna\r\nfrom my fellow-guests. One and all were quite convinced that I had taken\r\nleave of my senses. Only a mad woman would think of going to Angora at\r\nthis season and on the brink of war!\r\n\r\n_The Spaniard_ had spent his life in the Near East and knew the Turks!\r\n“Your own friends,” he said, “the Ministers who know you, may show you\r\nthe greatest respect; but you are English and cannot speak the language.\r\nThe _people_ are mere fanatics!” However, he gave me a box of insect\r\npowder, a bottle of iodine, and—most welcome of all to me—a yard of\r\nflannel to make an abdominal belt!\r\n\r\n_One Italian_ implored me to “come back and enjoy the Italian skies....\r\nYou will freeze in Angora.” He gave me a packet of chocolate and half a\r\nbottle of cognac.\r\n\r\n_A Second Italian_ could only endeavour to “face the fact” that I was\r\ndetermined to have my way. As he knew something of where I was going, he\r\nbrought me quinine, asperin, mosquito-cream, and calomel.\r\n\r\n_The Dane_ was horrified to learn that I had no gold. “Gold is essential\r\nin war-time. Gold saved my life in Russia;” and he handed me in exchange\r\nfor paper fifty gold Turkish pounds, which, however, proved more weighty\r\nthan useful.\r\n\r\n_The Dutch Parson_ gave me his blessing. Though generally optimistic and\r\npro-Turk, he admitted that things looked unusually black at the moment,\r\nand advised me to “wait and see.”\r\n\r\n_A British Naval Officer_ would not admit the sarcasm of his comment\r\nthat it was “very interesting” of me to “go to Angora!” He considered\r\n“the Turks the finest race on the face of the earth.... My God, they\r\nknow what I mean!” And, personally, I believe they knew very well.\r\n\r\n_One American_ could only repeat that “it was a mad idea.... We are not\r\nsafe even here. There is plenty of oil there, certainly, but—heroics\r\n_is_ heroics!”\r\n\r\n_A Second American_ wanted to know “what they were giving me for this\r\nstunt,” and guessed “it was a pretty high figure.” That I was going on\r\nmy own responsibility and paying my own way he “simply would not\r\nbelieve.”\r\n\r\n_The South American_ was the first of them all to express any confidence\r\nthat the Turks would be kind. What _he_ dreaded for me was the\r\ndiscomfort. “Above all,” he said, “avoid the Red Army.”\r\n\r\n_The Englishman_ characteristically pinned his faith on the courage of\r\nour race. “It has brought you here,” said he, “and I believe it will\r\nbring you back.... Here is my woollen jacket, a tin of milk, and this\r\nletter to an American friend of mine. Promise me, if _ever_ you are in\r\ndifficulty, you will seek his help.”\r\n\r\nI afterwards made inquiries about this invaluable ally, though I was,\r\nfortunately, in no danger. I found that, after all, he never reached\r\nAngora, though he had applied to go there last March!\r\n\r\n_A Third Italian_ told me that he had just found a little silver St.\r\nAntoine de Padou among the ruins.... “My prayers for you will go with it\r\nalways. After the snows of Angora, our Italian sunshine, its songs and\r\nits laughter, will await you.” Besides the St. Anthony, he gave me a\r\nbook of Italian proverbs, a box of insect-powder, cough-drops, and\r\nchocolate.\r\n\r\n_The Frenchman_ only exclaimed: “No Angora for me, _merci_! I am\r\ncounting the hours until the boat arrives to take me away from all\r\nthis.”\r\n\r\n_The Englishwoman_ (Mrs. de C——) felt proud to think of the “feather in\r\na woman’s cap,” that such an adventure would surely prove.\r\n\r\n_The Dutchman_ declared that he would trust even his own daughter on\r\nsuch a journey, if “the Vali had pledged his word for her safe\r\nconduct.... I know this country inside out—its language, its dangers,\r\nits possibilities, its virtues and faults.... You may trust the Vali....\r\nIf war breaks out, they will take you, with all possible politeness, to\r\nthe nearest frontier.”\r\n\r\nHe gave me all kinds of useful information, and much-needed boxes of\r\nmatches and cigarettes.\r\n\r\nTruly a wonderful budget of advice and a most original collection of\r\ngifts! Did ever a woman thus start such a quest?\r\n\r\nYet they had made me sad! Some were born here, others had lived in the\r\ncountry all their lives, and how few of them would trust the Turk, to\r\nwhom, after all, they owed, at least, their material existence.\r\n\r\n“I will show you,” I said, as we were all assembled for farewell, “that\r\nI am right, and you are _all_ wrong. Though my country may turn on\r\nTurkey, she will be good to me.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was nearly seven o’clock next morning before the officer came for me.\r\nIt was so late that our horses had to be whipped up to a smart pace over\r\nthe bumpy road to the station. My conductor had been so anxious about\r\nall arrangements, that he had packed the food for our five or seven\r\ndays’ trip, and entrusted it to a chauffeur, who was perverse enough not\r\nto wake up in time.\r\n\r\nThis certainly might be regarded as an omen of ill-luck, and even as I\r\ngot into the train, between the officer and a cheik (who had been\r\nprofessor of Arabic at Oxford), the South American stepped forward to\r\nask whether, after all, I had not better return with him.\r\n\r\n“And show the Turks I do not trust them.... Never. Besides, this\r\ngentleman has lived in Oxford, and is therefore almost a compatriot.\r\nTell my friends in Smyrna that I am perfectly well and happy, and that I\r\nam going to have a lovely time.”\r\n\r\nI saw that both my conductors were greatly pleased by my expressions of\r\ntrust, which they well knew how to appreciate.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, when we had been driving along the quay and my eyes had\r\nfallen on our own man-of-war flying the Union Jack without which, for\r\nthe first time in my life, I was embarking upon my perilous way, I was\r\nnot far from tears.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts were crowded with all that England has ever meant to me,\r\nfrom the quiet corner in the churchyard where my father is sleeping, to\r\nthe little face, seldom innocent of jam, that looks up so eagerly to\r\ntell his “Auntie” he has been a naughty boy.\r\n\r\nShall I, indeed, soon find myself in an “enemy” country, which surely\r\nshould be, as I have always known it, the land of my England’s dearest\r\nfriends?\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n EMOTIONS AND IMPRESSIONS—“ON THE WAY.”—NOWHERE TO HOUSE THE POOR PEOPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was, indeed, a kindly Providence that led the cheik to accompany us\r\nupon this stage of my tour. No one could have been more polite and\r\nthoughtful, more ready to gratify my every wish at great personal\r\nsacrifice, than the officer from Smyrna. But he had not been at Oxford;\r\nhe could not speak our language with the distinguished accent of that\r\nUniversity; above all, he had not the vast culture of this man of God.\r\nHis information would have been conveyed in German, a language I speak\r\nwith _no_ pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe cheik has large brown eyes, a dusky skin, and a face which, though\r\nstamped with suffering, is kindness itself. He wore a long grey coat and\r\nturban, and appeared to me at that moment years older than his actual\r\nage. Maybe my inborn veneration for Oxford professors misled me; and no\r\ndoubt I was also influenced by the obvious respect of the many\r\nhoary-headed disciples who came to the station to bid their “Master”\r\nfarewell, bending to kiss his hand and receive his blessing. Great\r\nerudition, again, must always add to a man’s appearance of age, and his\r\nallusions to varied experiences in many a Moslem land did certainly\r\nsuggest the passing of years.\r\n\r\nLike myself, however, he was going to Angora for the first time,\r\nventuring behind the long line of bayonets which still separates that\r\ntroubled land from the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nIn complete sympathy with my admiration for these men who had suffered\r\nand been victorious, he was eager to learn a little of the tribulation\r\nthrough which they had fought their way to liberty and freedom.\r\n\r\n“It seems to me,” I began, “that were I the British High Commissioner, I\r\nshould have found some means of, at least, paying a visit to Angora.\r\nWhat do our legislators yet know about this land under their charge, for\r\nwhich they have been made responsible? They can have no idea of the\r\npeople’s aims, their faults and their virtues. You might as well take\r\ncharge of some province in heaven of which you only know that it\r\nexists.”\r\n\r\n“There is not a Turk to-day who would not welcome you as British High\r\nCommissioner,” was the gallant reply. “We are, indeed, deeply grateful\r\nfor your trust. You have found the key to unlock Moslem hearts—to\r\n_trust_ us.”\r\n\r\n“Surely it is with nations as with individuals, the man who trusts and\r\nis deceived will yet prevail over his deceiver, whatever temporary\r\nprofits that traitor may grasp. There can be no final conquest over\r\ntruth. That was my late father’s teaching, and if it has sometimes left\r\nme an easy prey to liars and thieves, it has not killed my faith in\r\nhuman nature or hurt my pride. Self-respect will always compel me to\r\ntreat every man as my friend.”\r\n\r\nAs we proceeded on our journey, one felt hourly more conscious of the\r\nbarrier that has been so unwisely set up between the Allies and Angora.\r\nAs railway and telegraphic communications had been cut off, news was not\r\nonly delayed, but distorted beyond recognition. One only marvels that\r\nsome grave disaster has not arisen from such confused reports, apparent\r\ncontradictions, stern threats, and frequent misunderstandings. It would\r\nseem as if the Allied Commissioners had no desire to keep in touch with\r\nthis “little Republic of the Mountains.”\r\n\r\nIn all my wanderings I have never experienced such an overpowering sense\r\nof isolation. For me there have been no “personal” communications from\r\nEurope since October. That “English letters are not accepted in\r\nAnatolia,” that all my friends’ news will be returned to them marked\r\n“Service suspended” or “cannot be reached,” may explain the facts but\r\ndoes not make them easier to bear. When homeless dogs howl and whine\r\noutside my bedroom window, superstitions will intrude—dread of disaster\r\nto distant friends.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, another and far more cheering side to our experiences\r\non the road. The “stranger within the gates” is still a sacred person to\r\nthese peasants, even although from an “enemy” land. There was absolutely\r\nno sign of hostility all along the line, but everywhere the greatest\r\nkindness. One and all gave me the gracious Eastern welcome, in\r\npicturesque phrases, commending me to the care of Allah; these\r\n“fanatics” from whom mere murder was the smallest evil I had been told\r\nto expect!\r\n\r\nThough we had started, through no fault of our own, without any\r\nprovision for food, I did not anticipate any serious inconvenience on\r\nthis account. In these hospitable countries I knew we had only to name\r\nour need. The cheik, indeed, had been presented with two large baskets\r\nof food by his disciples, and also carried a picturesque terra-cotta\r\nwater-pot, which he could refill whenever we stopped to alight.\r\n\r\n“Eat, my children,” said he, “and when all is finished, the Lord will\r\nprovide.”\r\n\r\n“What a feast from the Song of Solomon,” I exclaimed, as the contents of\r\nhis basket were disclosed—pomegranates, spices, nuts, helva (i.e., honey\r\nand nut-cheese), raisins, and bread!\r\n\r\nOne is grateful for these slow trains that afford such ample opportunity\r\nfor seeing the country, with its fig-trees, olives, and palms, and the\r\nbright sun bringing a climate that recalls the South of France. Yet\r\neverywhere, long before we reached the actual devastations, one felt\r\nthat despair and sadness were hovering over the land. At first, we\r\nsought in vain for the reason of our impressions. Then suddenly I knew:\r\nThere were no cattle.\r\n\r\nOf course, Mrs. de. C—— had told me, they had all been brought into\r\nSmyrna by the Greeks. Outside her house mules were being sold for\r\nfourpence or sixpence apiece, and if no purchaser could be found even at\r\nthat figure, the wretched creatures were left mutilated on the wayside,\r\ntheir eyes burnt out, their legs broken by hatchets!\r\n\r\nOur first halt was at Manissa, once a flourishing town of about ninety\r\nthousand inhabitants, standing some sixty-five kilometres above\r\nsea-level. The Governor and all the “notables” were on the platform to\r\nwelcome the travellers, and had arranged that the “train should wait,”\r\nfor us to be shown round.\r\n\r\nSome kind of most primitive carriage had been produced from somewhere,\r\nand we were driven through more “ruins” to the “temporary” town hall for\r\nthe inevitable coffee and cigarettes. In the best English, the governor\r\ntold us of Greek atrocities and the victory of M. Kemal Pasha,\r\nintroducing us also to his whole staff.\r\n\r\nI asked whether it would be possible for me to obtain precise figures of\r\nthe devastations, and he promised they should be prepared for my use at\r\nonce. When I reminded him of the “waiting” train, he merely waived such\r\ndifficulties aside as a “secondary consideration,” begging me “not to\r\nmention it.”\r\n\r\nNaturally, I found one ruined town very like another. There was, in a\r\nsense, little to see beyond “parts of” the mosques, badly scorched or\r\nhalf-burnt minarets, and, at Manissa, no more than one thousand houses\r\nstanding out of fourteen! Also, the statistics reveal a heartrending\r\nloss of life!\r\n\r\nThe women and children, I learnt, had been driven into the mosques,\r\nwhich were surrounded by machine-guns to ensure against any possibility\r\nof escape, and _then_ set on fire. As the full realisation of such\r\nhideous barbarity took hold of my imagination, it was as if all my\r\nsenses were paralysed. That cold perspiration which so often precedes a\r\nfaint, seized my limbs. I was powerless either to speak or move. How\r\nwould our twentieth century appear to the old cave-dwellers it has\r\npleased us to call savage? Mrs. de C—— was right, indeed, to say that\r\nthe Turks were “moderate.” Such scenes must compel revenge and let loose\r\nthe worst passions of men.\r\n\r\nOn our return the cheik tactfully endeavoured to distract our thoughts\r\nby hospitable preparations for lunch. However little one felt disposed\r\nto eat, he could have devised no kinder or more wise expression of\r\nsympathy and understanding. Unfortunately, we had not yet escaped the\r\ncompany of swarming flies, which afterwards vanished, however, with\r\nstartling completeness, when the train climbed into colder altitudes.\r\n\r\nOur next halt was at Kassaba, where the “notables” again paid us a\r\nvisit, offering _both_ coffee and tea, one after the other. When the\r\ncheik mentioned the loss of our food, _and_ my partiality for fruit, a\r\nmessenger was at once sent into the town for bread and the most luscious\r\nmelons, which reach to the highest possible perfection in Anatolia. I\r\nhave always been grateful for Turkish fruit!\r\n\r\nThe Governor told me “he had simply _nowhere_ to house the poor people.”\r\nHe “dare not think” of how they could pass the winter! I _saw_ them,\r\nsitting in holes among the ruins, cooking whatever they had been able to\r\nscrape together for a meal; the women huddled together in the “beds” of\r\nfountains which were covered with straw and carpets, after the water had\r\nbeen drained out. This arrangement permitted the slight protection of an\r\nawning, only too badly needed for their threadbare clothes!\r\n\r\nThere seems no way of coping with the emergency, since they had no tools\r\nfor even the most primitive building. Except for those lucky enough to\r\nsecure one of the few booths in the town, the shopkeepers had to set out\r\ntheir stock upon the cobblestones!\r\n\r\nI dare not ask how many babies had died of cold. Anatolia has been bled\r\nwhite through twelve years of war! Whatever the nation’s quarrel, it was\r\nfrom hence were taken father, or brother, or son. Yet still, beside\r\nthese shivering women, you see long train-loads of more soldiers,\r\ncattle-trucks full of human beings, called to some new “front.”\r\n\r\nHow is it these women can, even now, tenderly hush “the cry of the\r\nchildren,” and give their men? Theirs is a “willing” sacrifice for an\r\nideal, the freedom and independence of the Fatherland.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI had been “protected” in advance, I found, by the authorities, who had\r\nannounced by telegram the arrival of “an American lady.” It was,\r\nperhaps, perverse, even ungrateful, but I persisted in contradicting the\r\nnews at every stage. I would far sooner take all risks under my own flag\r\nthan falsely accept shelter beneath the “Stars and Stripes.” “I have no\r\ndislike for America,” I assured those who assumed that explanation of my\r\nobstinacy, “it simply does not happen to be my country, any more than\r\nIndia is yours.... I have nothing but good to say of individual\r\nAmericans; the most charming people on the face of the earth.”\r\n\r\nNevertheless “I keenly resent the clamour of Mr. Morgenthau for ‘an\r\nideal republic of his own making on the banks of the Bosphorus, to be\r\nbacked by all that “Tammany” means in the U.S.A.’ I am for asking him,\r\nthen, to start by making an ‘ideal’ republic on the banks of the\r\nHudson.”\r\n\r\nAmerican oil-hunters are always boasting that _they_ never declared war\r\non Turkey. “You did not,” I have admitted, “but you urged, nay begged\r\nand almost ordered, us to do it for you.... Your _Literary Digest_\r\nprinted at least one eloquent appeal to Great Britain for a ‘holy’ war\r\nagainst the ‘unspeakable Turk’!” And if they resent my protest at being\r\ncalled “an American,” I am convinced they would have done the same in my\r\nplace. They, too, have the virtue of national pride.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe train was held up once more for a little excursion to what had been\r\nthe prosperous town of Alaşehir, a well-wooded district with abundance\r\nof fresh water. Here out of four thousand eight hundred houses only one\r\nhundred remain, and the women and children have been simply wiped out!\r\nUnfortunately, we had not time to visit the Hodja, who had found a quite\r\ncomfortable lodging in the trunk of an oak tree—a philosopher and a man\r\nof letters. “I cannot live in a tub, like Diogenes, because I do not\r\npossess a tub; but there is nothing wrong with this oak, which I suspect\r\nwill prove even warmer.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEverywhere, at Manissa and Kassaba—even at Salihli, with its houses\r\nreduced to four!—we were invited to stay and “put up for the night!”\r\nHere were about two hundred inhabitants surviving from two thousand five\r\nhundred, and from fifteen to twenty families sleeping in the mosque.\r\nYet, they would “certainly arrange something,” and it needed all my tact\r\nto refuse any more extended hospitality than tea and coffee, served on\r\nthe roof of one of their four houses, from which we could look down upon\r\nthe skeleton town. Apparently, these stricken people found some sort of\r\ncomfort in the mere idea of my having _seen_ their suffering, though\r\noften enough I could not even find _words_ for the sympathy no one could\r\nfail to feel.\r\n\r\nOnce more lunch in the train. Pomegranate seeds should be eaten one by\r\none, a slow process, but as the cheik says “it passes the hours!”\r\n\r\nHe apologised for the number of times I had been reminded of what in\r\nTurkey they call “the work of the British ex-Premier.”\r\n\r\n“I had to expect that,” I replied, “when I came to Anatolia; and it\r\ngives me the chance of reminding the Turks what part was played by M.\r\nVenizelos!”\r\n\r\nHe tactfully turned the conversation to Oxford, paying a very high\r\ntribute to Mr. Asquith’s brilliant son: “A noble character, highly\r\nintelligent and broad-minded. A victim of war we could ill afford to\r\nlose!”\r\n\r\nAssociation inevitably led to the question I must have been asked a\r\nhundred times during my journey, “Why does Lloyd George hate us so\r\nbitterly? How can he admire the Greeks?”\r\n\r\n“He knows little of either,” I replied, “nothing, at any rate, from\r\npersonal observation of them in their own lands. We have first-class\r\nNear-East specialists, no doubt; but his chief informants have been\r\nnonconformist preachers, even more biassed than he. Nonconformity is the\r\ntraditional foe of the Turks. Their boasted ‘freedom of thought and\r\nconscience’ does not extend to the Servants of the Prophet, and as they\r\nonce echoed Gladstone, to-day they echo Lloyd George.”\r\n\r\n“And in America?” asked the cheik.\r\n\r\n“Their church is an advertising agency. They have transformed ‘dissent’\r\nto a ‘trust.’ Go to the States with an idea, and, if it pleases them,\r\nthey will ‘put it across’ like any other commodity, as a ‘cute’ business\r\nproposition. With a colony of two million Greeks, and, maybe, as many\r\nArmenians (whose exaggerated and unchecked ‘lamentations’ have full\r\nFree-Church support), America will never give Turkey even a fair\r\nhearing. You have read their ‘Press’?”\r\n\r\n“Alas,” he answered, “I fear the East is losing its faith in the West.”\r\n\r\n“Do not say that,” I answered. “Men like you, who have known us at our\r\nbest, must declare that to-day’s madness is but a phase. Tell us these\r\nthings should never have been and shall not continue. Write as you _can_\r\nwrite, and teach the people of Europe to be once more themselves.\r\n\r\n“When East and West shake hands again, there will be peace, and peace we\r\n_must have!_”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n MORE IMPRESSIONS—“SITTING AMIDST AN ARMY OF SUPPOSED SAVAGE FANATICS,\r\n                     DEBATING THE GREATNESS OF GOD”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE train is slowly crawling up the heights, the air grows colder and\r\ncolder, we put on wrap after wrap, and, all of a sudden, not a fly to be\r\nseen!\r\n\r\nThe scenery, meanwhile, seems more desolate at every mile we pass. The\r\nhorribly systematic destruction has overlooked nothing, and every\r\nvillage is in ruins. The corn, so carefully hidden in pits, has been\r\nburned; the water, on which life itself depends, has been polluted; the\r\npeasants are vainly digging in search of the hard-earned paper money,\r\nsavings which they had buried beneath the soil, only to turn up a few\r\nblack cinders! Even the trees have been nearly all razed to the ground.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing you can tell me about the “devastated areas” in France,\r\nfor I have visited every inch of the ground; but there the people could\r\nmove on to the next villages, and were not imprisoned among the ruins. I\r\nwould not minimise German atrocities, but they did not fill the churches\r\nwith women and children before firing them! The wholesale destruction of\r\nvillages and of cattle is not “legitimate warfare,” but this butchering\r\nof women has put the Greek outside the pale of civilisation.\r\n\r\n“They have left us the sunset,” I could only murmur, “this marvellous\r\npanorama of which one never tires.” The desolation, indeed, lends it a\r\ndouble wonder. Why cannot men, too, die in glory?\r\n\r\nThe railway line has been cut at Gunhani. Here, no doubt, the Governor\r\nhas been instructed not only to welcome us with every comfort—tea,\r\ncoffee, and statistics—but to find us beds which do not exist!\r\n\r\nWe are travelling in the dark, since the sun has deserted us. Every now\r\nand again the officer flashes out his little electric lamp to see that\r\nall is well. The feelings of my fellow-passengers must be murderous, for\r\nhave I not kept the train waiting all along the line, so that we are\r\neven later than normal Turkish management would have made us? But I can\r\ndetect no black looks.\r\n\r\nIn the pitchy darkness, as the train slows down for the last time,\r\nbefore its immediate “return” journey, ragged figures are seen crowding\r\nthe station. Their turbans are brightly coloured, despite the dirt and\r\nrain to which they have been exposed; their clothes are mere “shreds and\r\npatches”; they have fashioned themselves picturesque slippers of straw.\r\nLike the grotesque figures of some stage chorus from no man’s land, they\r\ndart about us on every side, each man seizing upon some one article of\r\nluggage. If I express anxiety about my possessions, the cheik bids me\r\n“fear not. God is with us. All is well, and in a short while we shall\r\nremember this discomfort but as a page of history.” It was a lesson\r\nagainst worry I never forgot—the secret of Islam’s suffering in silence!\r\n\r\nStumbling over a stony and dangerous roadway, we at last reach a tent on\r\nthe side of the mountains, which has been prepared for us by the reserve\r\nofficers. We must sit on the cheik’s trunks and prayer-carpets, for the\r\nground is damp and mists enfold us. My chivalrous friend insists on\r\nwrapping about me his shawl, his scarf, finally his long coat. “I do not\r\nfeel the cold as you do,” he declares as I try to protest; but the touch\r\nof his hand contradicts the kind words.\r\n\r\nIn the distance we could see a few hill-fires and the torches of\r\nnight-wanderers as we enjoyed our evening meal. But no sooner had I\r\nbegun to wonder how many hours must pass before our experience became\r\nhistory, than, behold, a gust of wind tore up the prop of our tent and\r\nburied us in confused _débris_.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing for it but to extract ourselves and sit _upon_ instead\r\nof _beneath_ the shelter that had been found for us. The cheik bravely\r\nproceeded to delight me with all the wisdom of his religious philosophy\r\nwhile the officer went in search of help. I have done strange things in\r\nstrange lands, but I wonder what would British “authority” say to this?\r\nAn unarmed, but fearless, Englishwoman in the damp, cold mists, waiting\r\nthrough the dark night for her “discomfort to become history,” amidst an\r\narmy of supposed savage fanatics, and debating the greatness of God!\r\nTruly, the Unknown bears strange offspring.\r\n\r\nLittle darts of light, no bigger than glowworms, are now everywhere\r\nmoving up and down the steep paths through the black mist.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy for the swiftest of native messengers to track the\r\n“hidden” official of the mountains. Yet they seem to slip over the dark\r\nways like birds, carrying their message and returning while you are\r\nwondering if they have yet started upon the road. Men have been\r\ndespatched, like carrier-pigeons, in all directions, and we soon hear\r\nthat the commandant, two hours away, has set out to find us, and we are\r\nto walk as far as we can to meet him.\r\n\r\nOnce more the long procession, carrying its shawls and cushions, bags\r\nand water-pots, is marching in hope of a night’s repose. In a little,\r\nhowever, from somewhere, “orders” come in to “halt, and prepare the lady\r\na bed.”\r\n\r\nBehold, it is done. Two boxes are found to support a wooden plank,\r\n_beneath_ which the cheik will find some measure of rest for his weary\r\nlimbs, though he has given me his prayer-mat for mattress, his\r\nattaché-case for a pillow and, against my express command, nearly all\r\nthe wraps in his possession. Under such conditions one does not\r\n“undress” for the night; but rather contrives every possible addition to\r\nthe number of thick woollen garments normally required in these climes.\r\nThe officer has not even a rug to protect him from the damp earth, and I\r\nfind words strong enough to resist the loan of his coat.\r\n\r\nAlas! I am not, after all, a true Eastern. My philosophy will not bring\r\nsleep. Never since the days when the awful stream of gassed men were\r\nbeing carried into the hospital, have I listened to such a terrible\r\nchorus of coughs. There is little enough “quiet in sleep” on these\r\nsaturated clay mounds, although I no longer hear the Nationalist Anthem\r\nand other patriotic strains, to the accompaniment of a piping flute,\r\nwhich had been rising about me in the evening air.\r\n\r\nProbably the cold that seemed almost beyond endurance, did not really\r\nmaster me for long, as all these numbing horrors were lost in\r\nunconsciousness before the dawn.\r\n\r\nI am awakened at last by the officer who ventures to “shake the\r\nsleeper,” being seriously alarmed, he tells me, by my pale looks. There\r\nis a most welcome glass of hot tea, and a fire! A mingling of German and\r\nTurkish assail my ears, while from the distance I hear a silver voice\r\ncalling the “faithful” to prayer. Here is a free translation from the\r\ncheik, of the muezzin’s words: “Get up, you lazy fellows, rise, make\r\nyour ablutions, and praise God for His goodness.”\r\n\r\nI can only repeat “praise God,” though in face of what we have seen even\r\nthese words seem almost mockery.\r\n\r\n“God is great,” said the holy man, “but man will not understand His\r\ngreatness. God loves the East, whence came thought, philosophy, and\r\nfaith. The Christ we, too, venerate, came from the East. Yet the West\r\nhas given us nought but injustice. You who love the East, pray for\r\ntolerance and understanding between all peoples.”\r\n\r\nThe muezzin has awakened all the soldiers in the mountains. One could\r\nfancy a scurry of rabbits from the hidden tents. They are fetching water\r\nfor the ablutions, and I, too, must wash me—in eau de Cologne. The blood\r\nflowing into my numbed limbs forces a cry I cannot stifle. “That is what\r\nhappens when a woman goes out to war,” I said with a laugh, for the\r\nofficer confessed that I had given him some anxious moments.\r\n\r\nYet another cup of tea outside the now stifling tent, over the exquisite\r\nviolet-tinted fumes of a charcoal fire—deadly poison, maybe, but\r\nharmless so long as you do not _know_.\r\n\r\nThe ablutions, a religious rite, are performed here in couples—one\r\npouring the water into the other’s hands, that he may wash his face\r\nthree times, carefully going over the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth. When\r\nhe, in his turn, pours the water for his companion.\r\n\r\nThe cheik tells me Moslem custom demands the body _must_ be clean,\r\nthough the clothes may not be free from dirt. If only the morning\r\n“ablutions” were part of our Christian creed, what a difference they\r\nwould make to the comfort, _par exemple_, of Naples!\r\n\r\nAll now lay down their “carpets,” and proceed to prayer. To-day, indeed,\r\nmany must manage with the bare earth. What an inspiring picture it\r\nis—the absolutely unselfconscious absorption of the humble and prostrate\r\nTurk before his God! There is, surely, a sense of shame to the true\r\nChristian for some of his own brethren in the sight of reverence so\r\nnatural and so devout.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy enthusiasm, unfortunately, does not extend to the steaming dish of\r\nmost sustaining breakfast-soup, compounded of flour and vinegar and egg.\r\nOne or two sips of the tonic are enough a send me to dry bread and a\r\nglass of tea—about my tenth since dawn!\r\n\r\nAll around us, though not yet in their uniforms, are scattered the\r\nfuture soldiers of the new Citizen State, ready and eager, poor fellows,\r\nfor their fifty miles march a day, on coffee and bread, or even on bread\r\nand water!\r\n\r\nBy what right do we ask such things from the sons of women? That, cut\r\noff from every pleasure, all joy in God’s world, they should spend their\r\ndays in war and prayer! They seem happier, somehow, than those of us who\r\nhave travelled and seen the world, who must think and judge for\r\nourselves, wondering at last what is Truth or Justice, where are the\r\nprofits of self-sacrifice? Love and joy are, after all, but the\r\n“negatives” of grief and hate. Abolish the dark couple, and you will\r\ngain the light.\r\n\r\nFor the moment, however, the soldiers of to-morrow are content. They\r\nhave never tasted alcohol; miserably clad, without proper clothing or\r\nshelter, they sit about us expressionless and resigned—singing hymns of\r\njoy that sound far more like a funeral dirge. There is no need for\r\nthought, since they are ready to die for their fatherland, their leader,\r\ntheir faith.\r\n\r\nYet, though they know I come from an “enemy” country, there is no\r\nkindness and consideration they will not extend to a woman who trusts\r\nthem. Where is the Bolshevism of those who have lifted me over every\r\nstep of mud, and are even now girding their loins to carry me onwards\r\nfor forty miles? Will _they_ massacre, who, at my bidding, would lay\r\nthem down for me to walk over were I to make such an idle request? Fear\r\nbelongs to those _responsible_ for England’s injustice. They, indeed,\r\namong these people, _would_ be torn limb from limb and trampled on unto\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nWe have no horses or anything on four legs to draw the loaded wagonette,\r\nthat must now carry the cheik and myself, in addition to its usual cargo\r\nof food and varied wrappings. I have, certainly, had “smarter” escorts\r\nthan the men now drawing our “equipage,” but never any with kinder\r\nhearts.\r\n\r\nThere is no thought here of payment for service. Money is firmly\r\nrefused; and from those who have, and seek, absolutely nothing for\r\nthemselves, such a welcome could not fail to touch the most callous of\r\nhuman beings. How is it that all Europe declares no one can “manage”\r\nthese simple folk? My own receipt for life with the Moslem—of mere\r\ncourteous consideration and unquestioning trust—has been repaid with\r\ncompound interest a thousand times!\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n       A JOURNEY ON FOOT—A COUNTRY MADE BY GOD, UNTOUCHED BY MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nIT is not given to many in this enlightened twentieth century to travel\r\nin a country as God made it, almost untouched by man. Upon the road from\r\nGunhani I saw no signs of man’s handiwork, save a few miles of\r\nDeacoville, a tunnel, and the primitive carts of Anatolia. These are\r\nmade from a few logs nailed together, and fastened to two wheels, cut\r\nsolidly out of a block of wood. Their continuous squeak does not seem\r\nout of keeping with the primitive surroundings, and may be regarded as\r\nan “accompaniment” to the peasant’s songs.\r\n\r\nThe story is told of a “benevolent” American whose imagination was fired\r\nby the project of turning this land into a “new America.” He would\r\nsubject the fertile soil to “intensive” cultivation and smother it with\r\nsky-scrapers. So he persuaded a Turk to come over to “God’s own country”\r\n(as man has made it) and study the United States.\r\n\r\nHis guest, however, refused to admire, took passage for home at the\r\nearliest possible opportunity, and informed his friends that, “having\r\nnow seen man’s ‘best’ country, he would never again leave God’s.”\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in the Western mind these wide stretches of waste land\r\namong the beautiful mountains, beneath a cloudless sky, cannot fail to\r\nrouse a longing to break the silence by a “little emptying of our\r\ncrowded towns.” The women and old men _are_ digging, sowing, and\r\ncultivating, with but slight return for their heavy labour; now that the\r\nyoung are all “wanted” for defence.\r\n\r\n“One day we _shall_ have peace,” said I to our carriers, and they\r\nmurmured “_Inch Allah!_” Turning my wish to prayer, I could only repeat,\r\n“We _shall_ have peace.”\r\n\r\nAs often as I can persuade them to rest, I seize the chance of telling\r\nthem about England. When I mention our great Moslem King George they\r\nnaturally confuse him with Lloyd George. And, later, “if your King loves\r\nhis Moslem subjects, as you say he does, why does he permit his Minister\r\nto remain?” I assure them that he will not, and their faces brighten as\r\nthey cry: “There will be peace, then.”\r\n\r\nAs we plunge into the tunnel, about a kilometre long, our men raise\r\nstrange howls which echo around us with the most weird effect; but we\r\nare in darkness that can be felt, and anyone coming unwarned in an\r\nopposite direction, which is _downhill_, could scarcely avoid a crash.\r\nAs it happens, there is an engineer on the line. Our men lift off his\r\nwagonette and replace it, further down, than ours.\r\n\r\nI marvelled that they had sufficient strength for the job, living on\r\ncoffee and bread. Meanwhile, our flashlight revealed Turkish ladies\r\nwalking along the tunnel without a glimmer of light to guide them, who\r\nmade their way by a continuous beating of sticks upon the wall.\r\n\r\nIn this strange land, one is not afraid! I think of all the alarm my\r\njourney excited in Smyrna, and am more than ever convinced that I _only_\r\nneed an interpreter. If I knew the language, I would go alone and\r\nwithout fear! Primitive people in Turkey have a high code of honour.\r\nThey would not steal a penny, they will not even accept what I offer to\r\npay. Though he would tear to pieces an enemy of his country, the Turk\r\nwould stand between me and danger, for he knows I am a friend.\r\n\r\nAt last we are out of the tunnel, stretching our legs with relief in the\r\nopen air. Suddenly a strange sound breaks on our ears from the\r\nmountains. As we stop to listen, we hear someone calling upon us to\r\n“Halt! You must go no further!” I remember—this day, they had told me,\r\nthere would be “war”! A strange figure seems to be hopping down the\r\nmountains, about 800 metres in height, which proves to be the\r\n_Commandant de la Place_. He had arrived at our tent very late the night\r\nbefore, and left me a “message of welcome.” Is he now bringing the\r\nterrible news the war has begun? No. Only offering us hospitality.\r\n\r\nHe had not expected us to start so early, and apologised for “calling in\r\nhis nightgown”—the only alternative to letting us pass his “inhospitable\r\ndoors.” I begged that I might take a photograph, and, leaving all our\r\nbelongings upon the wayside, we readily set out to climb the mountain,\r\nwhile he shouted the news of our approach to hasten the preparations of\r\nhis wife. As a matter of fact, the difficulties of the ascent were quite\r\nsufficient to give her ample time; and when we reached the house at\r\nlast, the pure, fresh air (that struck cold in spite of the brilliant\r\nsunshine) inspired a hearty welcome to “rest” after so stiff a climb!\r\n\r\nThe commandant (who is richly bronzed by outdoor life in the sun) seemed\r\nquite content with his two-roomed cabin among the hills, though one\r\ncould sense the tragic experiences he would never obtrude. Three of his\r\nchildren had perished from cold and hardship, and I caught anxious\r\nglances towards the two remaining, fine, sturdy-looking little creatures\r\nas they were. His mother-in-law, busily intent on grinding the corn,\r\nbore further witness to their hidden struggles.\r\n\r\nI was immediately given a chair; a mattress was found for the cheik, and\r\nonce more we learned that in this country you are expected to have some\r\ncoffee _before_ a glass of tea, and then roasted almonds and\r\nmelon-seeds. I like to think it was the children who decorated their\r\nlittle cat’s ears with pink tassels in our honour, much to the animal’s\r\nannoyance. While the pig had been also “decorated,” to _his_ intense\r\ndelight!\r\n\r\nMadame retired immediately on our arrival; but when “tea” was finished,\r\nI begged that she might join us. Though veiled and shy, she came. Then\r\nshe and her husband brought their outes (a Turkish guitar played with a\r\nfeather) and sang to us without any restraint.\r\n\r\nWe stayed with them so many hours that, at last, I began to fear I was\r\nexpected to make the first move. At three o’clock I asked the cheik when\r\nwe were going to continue our journey, and he quickly answered: “When\r\nyou please”—confirming my suspicions.\r\n\r\nI was now informed that we should probably be too late for the one train\r\nin the day, and have to face a journey of many hours in bullock-wagons,\r\ndrawn perhaps by mules. No one even hinted that I was to blame; yet no\r\none would have dreamt of being so rude as to tell me that it was _my_\r\nplace to break up the party!\r\n\r\nThe line from Smyrna to Angora had been cut at Gunhani, as had the line\r\nfrom Haïdar Pasha at Bilidjik and Kara-Keuy.\r\n\r\nFrom Gunhani we had to reach Afioun-Karahissar as we best could, partly\r\nby Deacoville, then by ox-wagon and luggage trains to Ouchak and on to\r\nAfioun. The railway bridge destroyed at Gunhani was a fine example of\r\nFrench engineering, which went right over the mountains, from eight\r\nhundred to a thousand feet high. It will take years to rebuild. The\r\nTurks do not complain, and have cheerfully accepted the terrible\r\ndiscomfort to passengers and goods traffic, with their usual philosophy.\r\n“The destruction of an important railway,” as they calmly remark, “is\r\nlegitimate warfare and first-class strategy.”\r\n\r\nWe could realise, however, what the disaster really _meant_, as we\r\nclimbed down, without the help of any kind of pathway, from the\r\ncommandant’s little house on the steep hills. Once on the road we took\r\nan ox-wagon, drawn by mules, for what was still little better than a\r\nmountain track, to the nearest point of the railway that was in order,\r\nin the direction of Afioun-Karahissar. Unable, like the cheik or any\r\nOriental, to sit on my legs, I had to let them hang over the side of our\r\nwagon.\r\n\r\nThis scurrying down from the commandant’s house was not “a picnic!” Our\r\nfearless drivers and their marvellously sure-footed beasts, could not\r\nprevent our being flung from side to side of the springless cart,\r\nholding on for dear life. Sometimes the officer had to spring out and\r\npush from behind to save us from falling backwards.\r\n\r\nThe telegraph wires, of course, were also cut; but the rapidity with\r\nwhich messengers are able to run and leap over these ragged mountain\r\nways enabled them to bring news _back_ to us, of the quickest way to\r\nfind a train, in an incredibly short time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  IN AN OX WAGON.\r\n  “Unable to sit on my legs, I have to let them hang over the side of\r\n    our wagon.”\r\n]\r\n\r\nI had found it a herculean task to reach, and return, from our resting\r\nplace on the hill-top. The bullock-cart seemed to find it scarcely\r\n_less_ difficult to manipulate the narrow and broken roadway. Yet the\r\nTurkish soldiers had _somehow_ found means and strength to heave their\r\nheavy artillery over these awe-inspiring passes, from which one slip of\r\nthe foot meant instant death.\r\n\r\nThere was, naturally, “nothing doing” at the station till very late that\r\nnight, when we should have to pass the dark hours in a luggage train.\r\nJust before it was due to start, however, the Governor arrived with\r\nsardines, fruit, and bread, of which we managed to make a good dinner\r\n“on board,” actually our first meal that day, except for the\r\ncommandant’s almonds.\r\n\r\nA chair was found for me in the empty carriage, but others had to sit on\r\nthe floor. We had candles and, by some means, word was sent in advance\r\nof our approach. They tell me it is quite a short journey, but I cannot\r\nhelp wishing that we had been able to stay in the bullock-carts.\r\n\r\nThrough that strange night—not so cold, indeed, as yesterday—we seemed\r\nto crawl on one mile and then shunt back two, to an awful accompaniment\r\nof clanging metal that made it impossible to sleep. I had only to close\r\nmy eyes for a moment and our train was certain to be violently thrown\r\nback. Really, I thought my head would be shaken off my body.\r\n\r\nAs always, the cheik made heroic efforts to wile away the dark hours and\r\ndistract my mind. There was no question I could ask him about Islam in\r\nvain. Here is the best I can reproduce of that fascinating lesson in\r\nfaith and philosophy delivered in a luggage train by night:\r\n\r\n“The very word _Obedience_ (_i.e._ Islam) is contrary to all Bolshevist\r\nideas, just as Bolshevism itself is contradicted by the Reign of Terror\r\nin Russia. Islam teaches the ‘preservation of property,’ Bolshevism\r\ndestroys it. Verily, the Turks must have passed through sorrow and\r\ntribulation before they could ever have felt any temptation to ally\r\nthemselves with the Russia of to-day. Yet the Soviet has helped us in\r\nour time of need, and we owe our fidelity to the alliance.”\r\n\r\nI spoke of the vast sums paid out by Russia to Abdul Hamid to maintain\r\nenmity between the Turks and Great Britain.... “That you have made\r\nfriends with your hereditary enemy surely means grave peril to India.”\r\n\r\n“So we all feel,” answered the cheik. “But we can never forget the shock\r\nto the Moslem world of the ‘rumour’ that Constantinople (the seat of\r\nCaliphat) would be handed over to Russia. England had gone back on her\r\nword and lost our respect for ever. Henceforth we could be deceived no\r\nlonger. We were cyphers, mere pawns, on the political chess-board of the\r\nPowers. The principles of Islam were distorted without hesitation to\r\nprove that no Christian peoples could live unmolested under Turkish\r\nrule. How could Great Britain be so blind to the unbounded respect she\r\nhad earned from Islam by her fine tolerance of _all_ religions in India?\r\nNow she has ‘changed all that,’ and the war in the Near East was a\r\n_religious_ war.”\r\n\r\nWhen I attempted to frame some excuses for the pro-Greek attitude of the\r\nBritish Government, he reminded me of our “old pride in Moslem\r\nallegiance. You have more Moslem than Christian subjects.... Is not your\r\nPrime Minister, Mr. Lloyd George, a democrat? Where can he find more\r\nperfect democracies than in the East, under Moslem rule? It is a ‘new’\r\nideal in the West. When President Wilson began to preach it, he was\r\nderided as a Utopian, because he was three centuries ahead of his time!\r\nEvery Moslem has _always_ been equal before the law—the Sultan stands\r\n_with_ his subjects.”\r\n\r\n“That does not quite ‘explain’ Abdul Hamid,” I said.\r\n\r\n“He was the exception we shall never repeat. You cannot argue from\r\nexceptions.... It is the English who have ceased to value the precepts\r\nof Islam. The Koran bids us obey those in authority. Rather than rebel,\r\nwe leave the country.”\r\n\r\n“And M. Kemal Pasha? Has he not rebelled?”\r\n\r\n“No, indeed. He simply defended his country, deposed the\r\nvassal-traitor-Sultan.... M. Kemal Pasha rules direct from the Koran. He\r\nwill have strength to set aside the heresies of the Byzantines that have\r\nbeen grafted on to our Government. It is nonsense to say that the Koran\r\nhas been found unfitted for the requirements of the twentieth century.”\r\n\r\n“There, I fear, I must plead guilty.”\r\n\r\n“You will see, when you have stayed among us a little longer, that it\r\ncan be honestly interpreted to meet man’s present needs.”\r\n\r\n“The freedom of women——?”\r\n\r\n“The ‘seclusion’ comes from Byzantium. M. Kemal will change that, if\r\nonly he does not himself make a foolish marriage.”\r\n\r\n“How do you mean—foolish?”\r\n\r\n“A princess. We attribute Enver’s downfall to his having married a\r\nprincess. He then required money to maintain his ‘royal’ position; we do\r\nnot inquire from whence it came! If M. Kemal Pasha follows his example\r\nwe shall lose faith in his democracy.”\r\n\r\n“And a foreigner?”\r\n\r\n“That is almost as bad. The helpmeet of _our_ choice for him should be\r\none who would help the country to progress along Eastern lines, not\r\nWestern. Rather a peasant than a foreigner or a princess.”\r\n\r\n“I hope he may find one with the intelligence of Halidé Hanoum, and with\r\nher womanly charm. To me she seems wholly delightful. She can advance,\r\nand remain a woman, as our Anglo-Saxon reformers have seldom done.”\r\n\r\n“We shall see; but you must make no mistake. You imagine that women ‘do\r\nnot count’ in the East, yet I assure you a foolish marriage for M. Kemal\r\nPasha would be a national disaster.”\r\n\r\n“I wish you were not so much against British rule.”\r\n\r\n“I must face facts. You have been doing strange things here for the last\r\ntwenty-three years. We do not object to you because you are rulers, but\r\nto the way in which you now rule. In Islam all the faiths co-operate.\r\nIsrael has its place, and we venerate Christ no less than our Prophet.\r\nIt is the same in England itself, yet the very men whom you receive in\r\nyour London drawing-rooms are spoken of in Egypt and India as\r\n‘natives.’”\r\n\r\n“Neither can I understand that.” I agreed.\r\n\r\n“No, _you_ would not; but, if you really want to know the truth, we are\r\ndiscouraged and hurt. How can your Empire accept your ex-Premier’s\r\npro-Greek campaign after his _glorious_ speeches in support of\r\ndemocracy?”\r\n\r\n“The more I think about it,” said I, “the less I understand.”\r\n\r\n“Well, the consequences for us are black. We were so long content to\r\npass our days in confidence that all was well with British at the helm.\r\nNow we are watching with anxious eyes; only we pray that the ‘to-morrow’\r\nwhich all good Moslems desire, may yet come with M. Kemal Pasha. I have\r\nsons, who must all be soldiers, since we no longer trust the West.”\r\n\r\n“Will they be educated in England, at Oxford?”\r\n\r\n“No, alas! They are in Germany. They must learn to put the\r\nresponsibilities of citizenship before sport. They must not associate\r\nwith men who might afterwards settle in Egypt and call them ‘niggers.’”\r\n\r\nThese were bitter truths for my pride in England.\r\n\r\nThe cheik, by the way, was born in Egypt, and regarded as a dangerous\r\nMoslem foe! I wonder if that can in any sense justify his exile from his\r\nnative land?\r\n\r\nAs he tells me: The victory of M. Kemal is the direct result of an\r\nattempt to express the spirit of nationalism, which will not be kept\r\ndown. For the first time Moslems have adopted the Nationalist appeal. If\r\nthat fail, you will be confronted by a Pan-Islam uprising. The eyes of\r\nall Moslem are on Turkey. Strike her, who is Islam’s head, and every\r\nlimb will rise in protest against the blow.\r\n\r\n“As a man of God,” I protested, “you have no right to speak of war.\r\nThere must _not_ be war.”\r\n\r\n“When responsible British Ministers refer to Salonika as the Gate of\r\nChristendom, we can no longer stand aside.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Governor and all the “notables” of Ouchak were on the platform as\r\nour luggage train arrived “in state.” When they invited us to stay the\r\nnight, I accepted at once, without giving anyone else the chance to\r\nrefuse. After three days and two nights on the road, I could not forego\r\nthe luxury of a wash and a change of clothes, or the chance to brush and\r\ncomb out my hair!\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n          A PUBLIC MEETING AT OUCHAK—HOSPITALITY—A SACRED RITE\r\n\r\n\r\nAT Ouchak, I frankly declined to spend another night in a luggage train.\r\nI admired the Turks’ resourcefulness in coping with the extremely\r\nlimited service of trains—the women inside a luggage-van and the men on\r\nthe roof. I do not regret the fact that I have probably endured even\r\nmore discomfort than other European visitors to Angora, since I have\r\nattempted and achieved more. But for the moment it seemed really\r\nessential to pause and rest.\r\n\r\nWe were told they had only one private train car on _this_ side of the\r\nbreak in the line, which had been reserved for the Minister of Finance,\r\nwhom we should probably soon meet. Engines were terribly “short,” and\r\nmost of the trains had been burnt by Greeks.\r\n\r\nThe Governor drove us to the house of one of the wealthiest men in the\r\ntown, once the headquarters of King Constantine. Our host proved to be a\r\nmere lad of twenty, who was nevertheless directing a large carpet\r\nfactory which had partially escaped destruction, with considerable\r\nefficiency and skill.\r\n\r\nThanking us with graceful dignity for the honour of our visit, he gave\r\nimmediate direction for our reception in his noble guest-chamber. He\r\napologised for the bareness of rooms, rifled by Greeks; but, in my\r\njudgment, the rich and wonderful carpets were furniture enough.\r\n\r\nAs M. Kemal Pasha had taken over the house from King Constantine, our\r\nhost asked me, in joke, whose “bed” I would choose! I naturally at once\r\nreplied M. Kemal’s. “Ah no,” said he, “you must not decide without\r\nseeing both.”\r\n\r\nBeing always afraid of air-raids, the Greek sovereign had taken an\r\nunderground suite, certainly arranged with great taste and every\r\nattention to creature comfort. Lit and heated by electricity, the\r\narrangements closely resembled a German trench. M. Kemal Pasha had slept\r\non the first, or top, floor, and as I like to think, under my white\r\nsatin covering, worked with irises. It was a proud moment for our\r\nhost—that _I_ should occupy a bed already honoured by M. Kemal!\r\n\r\nI told him how at Gerbervilliers Sœur Julie once let me sleep in a bed\r\npreviously occupied by Cardinal X., and even conferred on me the supreme\r\nhonour of using his Eminence’s sheet! That “last touch,” said my host,\r\nhe, “unfortunately, could not repeat. The Pasha’s sheets!—well, they\r\nwere not _here_.”\r\n\r\nWe soon sat down with the Governor, the Mayor, and other “notables,” to\r\na well-cooked meal of Turkish delicacies, supervised by our host\r\nhimself. My only criticism of Turkish dishes is based on their\r\n“fattening” qualities, and the pleasure in flavours which tempt one to\r\nover-eat.\r\n\r\nMore “notables” appeared for an afternoon reception, in strange and\r\npicturesque costumes: Deputies, hodjas, and judges. How I longed to\r\nborrow that judge’s saxe-blue silk robe for a dressing-gown; but,\r\nknowing that he would “give” me anything for which I expressed a fancy,\r\nmy honour sternly forbade the request! Everyone had left their shoes on\r\nthe mat, and sat in their stockinged feet. My muddy boots were a\r\ndisgrace.\r\n\r\nThey all talked Nationalism, overjoyed by the recent victories and, I\r\ncannot deny, bitter against Great Britain.\r\n\r\nI was invited to a big “Nationalist” meeting, to be held that night at\r\nthe Young Men’s Club, and was only too glad to have the chance of\r\nanswering the questions I knew they would want to put. It is always wise\r\nto encourage our critics to air their grievances.\r\n\r\nWe were conducted up a rickety staircase to a large room thick with\r\nsmoke. The men were all wearing kalpaks, and evidently puzzled at first\r\nby the “Englishwoman in their midst.” Some of them smiled, others\r\nplainly showed their surprise, and others just stared.\r\n\r\nAfter the cheik had opened the meeting in a very few words, our host\r\nrose to explain my presence. He told them that I had come to Angora\r\nentirely on my own responsibility, because, though our authorities\r\ncalled it “brink of war,” I wanted to convince the Turks that we should\r\nnot _have_ war.\r\n\r\nThen, with the Governor as my interpreter, I begged them “to believe\r\nthat Mr. Lloyd George’s policy was _not_ the policy of the English\r\npeople. He had only followed Gladstone in _this_ matter, and he had been\r\nled astray by M. Venizelos. No other Englishman would make war on\r\nTurkey, and we, the people, were therefore determined upon his fall.”\r\n\r\n“_Inch Allah_,” cried the people.\r\n\r\nThen I said that “whether our Conservatives or Labour men followed Mr.\r\nLloyd George, it would make no difference to them. Both parties are all\r\nfor peace. I was not Turkey’s only friend in Great Britain. We who knew\r\nwere all hard at work for peace.”\r\n\r\nIt was a strange meeting! Did the Governor really translate what the men\r\nactually said? Some were obviously filled with anger, though\r\n“_saura-saura_ and Mr. Lloyd George” was all I could catch. The Governor\r\ninterpreted, “The speaker does not approve of Mr. Lloyd George’s\r\npolicy.”\r\n\r\n“Nor do I,” I replied, which made them all laugh heartily.\r\n\r\n“In any case,” I concluded, “there is not going to be war. It is\r\ncontrary to all reason, and we have been enemies long enough! We are\r\ngoing to be great friends now.”\r\n\r\nI answered a host of questions, which, however, the Governor had\r\nsoftened in his interpretation to avoid hurting my feelings.\r\n\r\nFinally my host invited the audience to express their appreciation of\r\nthe visit from an Englishwoman, who had persisted, against such terrible\r\nodds, in coming to give them so much “news” from Great Britain; and the\r\nold wooden roofs echoed to their cheers and clapping.\r\n\r\nMaybe the British Government would scarcely have approved our meeting;\r\nbut there are many people in England who take a different view; and as I\r\ntold the people, “I had been seven years on the French front (a real\r\nslice out of one’s life) and I knew what war meant. I will not believe\r\nour men are going to be led to war again. However our politicians may\r\ntalk, whatever hysteria may be printed in the Press, we have sound,\r\npractical reasons for friendship. There is nothing in the Nationalist\r\nPact to which Great Britain can seriously object; nothing, certainly, to\r\njustify the shedding of blood on either side.”\r\n\r\nAfter the meeting we drove back to our comfortable quarters, and talked\r\nlong into the night over tea and cigarettes. Too tired to sleep, I told\r\nmy host if once I dozed off there would be no waking me “this side of\r\nanytime,” so I “let myself go” upon the glories of old England and the\r\nfine traditions of our race—a subject my present companions were still\r\nperfectly ready to applaud.\r\n\r\nWe passed on to America and her big Press. To their taste, British\r\njournalism is “just dry bones—without a breath of life.” They must have\r\nsomething picturesque, unrestrained by any considerations of taste or\r\npossible hurt to the feelings of those concerned.\r\n\r\nI told them of the strange pride with which an American dared to boast\r\nof an “interview” with King Constantine. “His Majesty,” as the reporter\r\nhad written, “without asking me even to sit down, drew from his pocket a\r\nhandsome case and helped himself to a cigarette. He naturally did not\r\noffer one to me.”\r\n\r\nConstantine was, naturally, infuriated by the sarcastic implication, and\r\ndenied the “interview” altogether. The “man from the States” promptly\r\nstarted an “action” against him, and withdrew it, once he had thus\r\nsecured far more publicity (which means dollars) than all the\r\n“interviews” he might have secured with deposed royalties, would ever\r\nhave brought his way.\r\n\r\nA lady compatriot of his, in the same spirit, once claimed to have\r\nsecured an “interview” with M. Kemal Pasha, and wrote that “he smoked\r\nPlayer’s cigarettes.” When I told her friend that this was certainly\r\nuntrue, he said: “What matters! It was good copy.”\r\n\r\nI was not, however, altogether surprised to learn that this “impression”\r\nof Constantine was, most probably, quite true. All kinds of similar\r\nstories were in circulation about the dead monarch, but the Turkish\r\nofficers were of opinion that, though as commander-in-chief he certainly\r\nappeared to live underground, there was little he could be expected to\r\nachieve with the army at his command. To be _fearless_ is a commandant’s\r\nfirst duty, and for that quality they were as ready to praise the fallen\r\nDjémal and Enver as M. Kemal Pasha himself. With all his faults and\r\nmistakes, none could accuse Enver of fear.\r\n\r\nMy “lady’s maid” on this occasion proved to be a picturesque young\r\nwoman, dressed in very bright colours, wearing her hair in two long\r\nplaits enclosed in a gay scarf. With the pleasant zeal of her race, she\r\nsquandered the whole contents of a beautiful Eastern water-jug in\r\n“pouring them over my hands,” a process which used up all the water long\r\nbefore I felt clean! And not even grease and eau-de-Cologne would drive\r\noff half the effects of these terrible days from my face. It was a case\r\nfor Turkish baths. And Nazafer, my little maid, proved so timid and\r\ngentle a hairdresser that I had to use some English “force” in this\r\ndirection when she had left me for the night.\r\n\r\nYet words cannot express the delight of this welcome change to all the\r\nluxuries of civilisation. A blazing wood fire, a hot bottle, and the\r\ngenerous supply of white satin cushions worked in a lovely iris design\r\non my vast, picturesque bed!\r\n\r\nIf the dogs outside could only accept their grievances with the silent\r\ndignity of the East! As I peep through my lattice windows over the\r\nhalf-ruined city, now bathed in the silver light of the new moon, I can\r\nonly marvel again that we hear scarcely a murmur from these suffering\r\npeople in their terrible distress. What do we want with this mutilated\r\ncountry for which they are ready to die?\r\n\r\nHere is the tale of a patriot that outstrips the wildest imagination to\r\nhave conceived. A certain woman, so poor that she had but one miserable\r\ngarment to protect her starving babe, catches sight of some “munitions”\r\nthat are lying near her, _exposed_ to the cold! She does not hesitate a\r\nmoment, but lifting her poor child’s only covering, carefully wraps it\r\nround the “instruments of war.” Maybe the good God will send me another\r\nchild,” she whispered; “at all costs, my country must be saved!”\r\n\r\nHow dare we attempt to hamper these people’s freedom, bought at so dear\r\na price? Surely the future is _theirs_ to shape as they will.\r\n\r\nWhen the morning is well advanced, and the sun is streaming upon me\r\nthrough scarlet lace curtains, I am at last awakened from dreams of\r\nburning cities to the alarms of war. Downstairs, sad and bewildered\r\nfaces almost convince me that actual hostilities have begun. But I am\r\nnow fully awake, and still refuse to believe.\r\n\r\n“It is absolute nonsense,” I insist on telling them. “_My_ country is\r\n_your_ friend.”\r\n\r\nBut even the optimism of our host had been shaken by the pessimist\r\nnewspaper reports. They all knew, however, that, if it _was_ war, I\r\nshould stay with them, and they would allow me to nurse our own\r\n“men.”... It was not the “men” who would make war; and I gladly repeated\r\ntheir high tributes to the fine soldierly qualities of the Turk, in\r\nstartling contrast to most Germans!\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur host himself superintended the preparation of my breakfast tray—eggs\r\nand butter, honey and jam, fruits and cheese.\r\n\r\n“You have sent me a grocer’s shop,” I exclaimed to him later, but he\r\nwaived aside my gratitude with a casual, “Don’t mention it.”\r\n\r\nI reminded him that he had promised I should see “madame” and the baby.\r\n“Could not she share our meal?” He said she was tired and really\r\npreferred to rest. Was the excuse diplomatic?\r\n\r\nHe told me that almost immediately after their marriage (about a year\r\nand a half ago, when she was only seventeen), they had “escaped” to\r\nRhodes, and it was only too likely their brief experience of home—such\r\nas war had left them—would be once more cruelly interrupted. She,\r\nunfortunately, did not speak French, but I could easily read in her\r\nlarge, pathetic, dark eyes the excuses she strove to offer for what\r\nwould never have struck me as “inadequate” hospitality.\r\n\r\nI tried to convey my deep sympathy to her husband. “You seem like a\r\ncouple of dear children,” I said, “just eager to make us all happy.”\r\n\r\n“Every Turk,” he replied gravely, “must marry young. The country needs\r\nchildren.”\r\n\r\nM. Kemal Pasha entirely confirmed the curious impressions that this\r\nhousehold could not fail to produce on any visitor from Europe. It\r\nalmost made one think of Turkey as the social Antipodes. In England so\r\nmany women are now doing men’s work, in addition to their own. Here we\r\nsee men working for both sexes. I have no doubt the sweet little lady\r\nhad “prepared” everything in advance, but when we arrived, she felt it\r\nbecoming to disappear! It was our host, again, whom I had surprised in\r\nthe midst of his ministrations for a most excellent lunch!\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was spent in driving about the pillaged city, visiting our\r\nhost’s carpet-factory and a number of weaving-looms in private houses.\r\nIt is a privilege, indeed, to see all these treasures of beauty shaping\r\nbefore one’s eyes. It must, I think, be a great relief for the “tired in\r\nmind” to “get busy” about mechanical work. One’s fingers soon turn into\r\nmachines, weaving the wool in and out of the frame, cutting the pile,\r\nthe whole process of creating those wonderful Eastern “floorings” we all\r\nadmire. The making of even “high art” goods must rest the nerves, like\r\nthe “perpetual motion” of my Scotch mother’s knitting needles!\r\n\r\nIn the distance the cemetery looked like a large field, glaring with\r\npoppies and cornflowers that it was puzzling to find so late in this\r\ncold climate. As we approached, however, the picturesque scene proved to\r\ncome from dyed wool left to dry on the tombstones, which were,\r\nthemselves, of a turban-like shape.\r\n\r\nIn the market we were astonished to find how quickly trade had\r\nrecovered, almost to pre-war activity, since my last visit. Somehow they\r\nhave discovered tools and wood to patch up booths for the old business.\r\n\r\nI told my companions I “hoped the people would soon be given material to\r\nrebuild the whole town, that Europe would send money in admiring\r\nrecognition of their ‘already proven’ ability to help themselves.”\r\n\r\nIt seemed almost a “confessional” for me, as the officers and municipal\r\nauthorities, the deputies and the hodjas, plied me with question after\r\nquestion, because they knew I would tell them all I could, and speak the\r\ntruth!\r\n\r\nThey brought me photographs—of cities in ruins, of mutilated and\r\ndisfigured human beings!—unfortunately too primitive for reproduction,\r\nbut no less invaluable as documentary evidence, almost too ghastly for\r\nman to “look on and live”!\r\n\r\nWe drove also to the aviation ground and were shown what the officer in\r\ncharge had contrived to make of the cannon left by Greeks. Though\r\neverything was systematically hacked to pieces, it had been all “put\r\ntogether again” by the Turks with astonishing patience and perseverance.\r\n\r\nNaturally proud of his work, and delighted to tell us how it had all\r\nbeen managed, the officer, fortunately, quite forgot I was English. He\r\nwas telling us that he found a few French 75’s, but that most of the\r\nguns were howitzers. Suddenly realising the need for caution, or rather\r\ncourtesy, he burst out: “Cannon, Lloyd George,” and won from us all the\r\nmost grateful and laughing applause.\r\n\r\nI was further especially pleased with his outspoken pride in the Turkish\r\nwomen aviators, of whom his own wife had been one. All honour to\r\nthem—from that Jeanne d’Arc of Turkey, Halidé Hanoum, to every woman who\r\nhad unloaded munitions from the boats and “done her bit” in the\r\nfactories!\r\n\r\nHe told us how women had watched for ships bringing munitions as for\r\nangels of deliverance. How they toiled at the unloading and bore their\r\nburdens with uncomplaining zeal. No man must lift a finger for work that\r\ncould possibly be undertaken by women. As M. Kemal Pasha says: “The\r\nwomen have _done_ their part in saving the country, they must _have_\r\ntheir share in governing it.”\r\n\r\nIt has always been supposed that France supplied most of these\r\nmunitions. But the Turks paid _us_ £5,000 sterling (at the present rate\r\nof exchange) for a load of their own munitions that we had “picked up,”\r\nand they bought arms from the English officers in Constantinople.\r\nFurther supplies, of course, were obtained from Frenchmen, Italians,\r\nRussians, and, incredible as it may seem, from the Greeks themselves.\r\nTurkey bought arms wherever she could, and set herself the grim task of\r\nreadjustment.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Governor had been telegraphing for us in all directions\r\nall day, for news of a train to take us on our way. All the services, of\r\ncourse, were disorganised, and the line cut—a message from Smyrna to\r\nKassaba might take twelve days! We would not worry, or hope!\r\n\r\nAt about 9.30, we hear of another luggage train! It is not a long\r\njourney from Ouchak to Afioun-Karahissar. We are now well supplied with\r\nfood and candles, a dilapidated deck-chair has been dug out for me, and\r\nthe cheik’s brilliant conversation will “make history” of the night.\r\n\r\nI had managed to have a few words with our host’s wife before we left\r\nthe house. Her husband translating, she thanked me again and again for\r\nmy visit, and then, asking me to excuse her going to see an ailing\r\nbrother, she sailed away with her little babe in her arms. As she turned\r\nsmiling on us from the big gateway, I could not resist blowing a kiss to\r\nthe child-like and pathetic figure she made—for all the world like a\r\nschoolgirl and her doll!\r\n\r\nTowards evening, as we were preparing to leave our host, I caught sight\r\nof a few tears rolling down his cheeks. Like an Englishman, he quickly\r\nbrushed them aside, and turned to me with a smile.\r\n\r\nWhat had I said, or done? We had been skating on thin ice all the time.\r\nI would never deliberately hurt anyone’s feelings, but I cannot resist a\r\njoke, and, in a foreign language, there is danger of misunderstanding.\r\n\r\nI found a chance of asking the cheik to tell me frankly if I had\r\nunwittingly given any offence, for which I would be only too eager to\r\ntender my sincere regret and apology. But he explained: Our host’s\r\nbrother-in-law had died during the night, and, not wishing to disturb\r\nour entertainment, his wife had bravely set out alone to attend the\r\nfuneral.\r\n\r\nSo even the most intimate domestic sorrow was not permitted to interrupt\r\nour enjoyment; the intrusion, as it _must_ be felt, of an unknown woman\r\nfrom an enemy land!\r\n\r\nI have never met, even in Turkey, such a fine spirit of hospitality.\r\n_My_ tears could not be kept back. Here was a mere lad heaping coals of\r\nfire on my head. Again and again the words sternly echoed in my brain:\r\n“These things should never have been.”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n          A LUGGAGE TRAIN—THE WORST STAGE OF MY WHOLE JOURNEY\r\n\r\n\r\nWE are an hour late, the rain is pouring in torrents as I mount from a\r\nTurk’s back to my now familiar “van”; the station is full of friends\r\ncrowding to witness our start and say farewell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  From a Turk’s Back.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAfter no more than an hour of what proved to be much the worst stage of\r\nmy whole journey, I was determined against any further dependence upon\r\n“goods traffic.” I should infinitely prefer to walk. Our compartment, I\r\nknow, had not been chosen for comfort—there was no other to be had. But\r\nthe roof leaked, the doors would not shut, it was impossible to keep our\r\ncandles alight.\r\n\r\nAt every few kilometres there is a halt. After an hour and a half the\r\ncheik and the officer are beyond words. Wrapped in rugs on the cold,\r\nhard floor, they are soon fast asleep, and now peacefully snoring. I\r\nshould have thought myself that our continual joltings were enough to\r\nwake the dead, but my friends, fortunately, seem able to sleep on,\r\npitched as they are every moment from side to side like long, shapeless\r\nbundles of woollen stuff. I put my umbrella up and donned a mackintosh,\r\nwhile our fellow-traveller, the Inspector of Forests, is no more able to\r\nsleep than I, but does his best to relieve the monotony by smiling at me\r\n(since we have no common language) whenever a candle is blown out and he\r\npatiently relights it.\r\n\r\nIt was, perhaps, no more than subdued hysteria which suddenly drove me\r\nto break the long silence with strange sounds of laughter that awakened\r\nand clearly startled the cheik. After a little, I managed, somehow, to\r\nexplain my unseemly outburst.\r\n\r\nThe day before leaving Paris I had written to Lord Robert Cecil in\r\nearnest endeavour to persuade that fine enthusiast for the League of\r\nNations that an international “Mother of Parliaments” could never\r\nmaintain its authority under suspicion of antagonism to Islam.\r\nTherefore, I begged him to remove the stigma once and for all by going\r\nto Angora himself. And now the picture had flashed into my mind of Lord\r\nRobert, having responded to my suggestion, only to find himself being\r\nrattled about beside me, under an open umbrella, on the floor of a\r\ncrawling luggage train in the black darkness of a wet night.\r\n\r\nIt was a relief just then for all of us to join in a good laugh; but the\r\npolicy of the League has not been helpful to Islam, and, in this matter,\r\nits unnecessary mistakes—as I have again and again pointed out—will\r\nprove a serious hamper to its otherwise splendid activities.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, our merriment is soon checked. Sudden shrieks from the engine\r\nand an exceptionally generous supply of jolts and bangs conjure up to my\r\nmind awful visions of a collision in the gruesome loneliness of the\r\nnight. The cheik, however, does not share my alarm, but calmly answers:\r\n“Methinks we do but unrail!” To me, however, the prospect suggested of\r\nending my days in an Anatolian ditch, without even the covering of my\r\nUnion Jack, offers but poor consolation.\r\n\r\n“Come, wake up,” I almost shouted, “it is too terrible! Someone _must_\r\ntalk to me about Islam.” And when I realised my own selfishness in not\r\nleaving the poor man to sleep, I could only put forth the plea: “I am so\r\ninterested in your religion.”\r\n\r\n“I am flattered indeed,” was the immediate response. “Religion in the\r\nEast is truly a real and living force.” At his grave words I saw again\r\nthat long line of weary soldiers among the mountains at their prayers.\r\n\r\n“I shall wound your feelings,” I went on, “if I persist in questioning\r\nyou about the grievances of your people, though God knows my curiosity\r\nis not idle.”\r\n\r\n“It is far better to wound my feelings and publish the truth than to\r\nsuffer the slightest risk of your misjudging us. You may help to see us\r\nrighted, for Great Britain may have indeed ‘sinned in ignorance.’”\r\n\r\nBut my allusion to Lord Robert Cecil had raised the problem of\r\nChristianity in the East. I had to admit that he was accused of working\r\nfor “union” between the Anglican and the Greek Churches. “He _is_ a\r\ndevout, loyal and energetic Anglican, but I refuse to believe that he\r\nwould ever encourage such criminal folly.”\r\n\r\n“He is, indeed, too honourable,” replied the cheik. “That is only\r\nanother example of bringing politics into religion, which must kill\r\nfaith.”\r\n\r\n“But does not Islam teach us that politics and religion are one?”\r\n\r\n“No, indeed; that is a false, Western, interpretation of the Koran. It\r\nis our work to-day to set free religion from the canker of all\r\nstatecraft.”\r\n\r\nI could not resist interposing at this point with my conviction that no\r\n_established_ Church can pursue wisdom; while the insecurity of our Free\r\nChurches to-day must always “put brakes” on their power against the\r\nGovernment, and “muzzle” the _real_ freedom of thought or truth.\r\n\r\nWhen we got back to Greece, the cheik gave me chapter and verse for his\r\nconviction that “if the Turks should allow the Greek Patriarch to remain\r\nin Constantinople, their tolerance would have degenerated to mere\r\nweakness.\r\n\r\n“It was a golden dream for the Greeks, nearly realised; but it is not\r\nfor us to substantiate it.\r\n\r\n“They were to drive us back into the depths of Asia Minor, to rule over\r\nthe peoples who had been their masters for five centuries, to recapture\r\nthe great ‘Bible’ towns for the Cross; to settle on the shores of\r\nMarmora and Constantinople, that they might drive on to Rome!\r\n\r\n“Their vision, assuredly, did not lack grandeur.\r\n\r\n“It even seemed for a little that realisation might be achieved by zeal\r\nand ardour, until King Constantine’s return provoked M. Briand’s famous\r\n‘Note’ of November, 1920, and put an end to the dream.”\r\n\r\nHere I uttered a word of regret that we had not then followed the policy\r\nof the French “surely a course that might have saved us from all the\r\njealousy and suspicion we have so perversely incurred.”\r\n\r\nThe cheik replied indirectly by reminding me that M. Venizelos was not\r\nto be quite so easily, or immediately, defeated: “A great, some say a\r\nsubtle and profound, personality, who had the _entrée_ to all the Courts\r\nof Europe. He formed in himself a strong link between the Greek Colonies\r\nand all the Powers, particularly England and America. He made British\r\nfriendship the pivot of ‘Greek Expansion.’ He was not a man to bow\r\nbefore any discouragement or difficulty.\r\n\r\n“Now he conceived the idea, attributed to Lord Robert Cecil, of union\r\nbetween the two Churches, which at once enlisted the strong support of\r\nanother Cretan, Monseigneur Metaxatis, no longer Metropolitan of Athens\r\nafter King Constantine’s return.\r\n\r\n“Metaxatis was received with open arms in America, where he devised the\r\nformation of an ‘American Orthodox Church.’ Your Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury was his next convert, and, thus supported, he was able to\r\nflout Ottoman protests and to appoint himself (or see that he was\r\nappointed) a ‘Patriarch’ at Constantinople, under the title of Metelios\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n“I scarcely see how any real union could be established between the\r\nProtestant-Anglican—or is it Catholic?—Church and the Greek, if we\r\nrealise the superstitions that Greece has never thrown off. The Greeks,\r\nwhatever their faults, have always been faithful to their old, classic\r\nreligion. The superstitions, if not the glories, of Hellas are, one and\r\nall, upheld to-day.”\r\n\r\nI said that I thought the hand of Providence could be seen in M. Kemal’s\r\nvictory, which had saved us from this preposterous idea.\r\n\r\nWhen I learned later, in Angora, of the Patriarch’s criminal disloyalty\r\non behalf of the Greeks, I almost wondered if Turkish religious\r\ntolerance had not been carried too far. This wily Churchman actually\r\ndared to make collections, _in Turkey_, for the Greek army designed for\r\nthe capture of Constantinople; openly preached treason and rebellion.\r\nYet he was sheltered behind his sacred office from the captivity of\r\nGeneral Trécroupis at Eski-Chéir!\r\n\r\nWhat can we say of this Cretan, who thus dared to tamper with our\r\nnational Church? What shall we say of his spiritual fathers who approved\r\nthe plan? What can we say for Greece?\r\n\r\nSurely the Churches, whatever their creed, should uphold honour between\r\nall men. If the power a priest inevitably exerts over the penitent is\r\nonce abused for political ends, religion becomes no better than treason.\r\nWe look up to those in positions of trust and responsibility: priests,\r\nlawyers, or doctors. When they betray their trust our sentence is doubly\r\nsevere.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe train now seems to have “put up for the night,” but it is shaking\r\nlike an earthquake; and as the rain lashes upon us in torrents, its\r\nengine shrieks in unison with others in the dark distance. Every moment\r\nI expected the whole construction to collapse. It was the old impression\r\nof the “cellars” during an air-raid, the horrible suffocation of\r\nclaustro-mania, or the terror of being buried alive.\r\n\r\n“I must get out.”\r\n\r\n“You cannot. Where will you go?”\r\n\r\n“I shall walk.”\r\n\r\n“You will be blown away or killed on the line.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot help it. I must get out. The train is choking me.”\r\n\r\n“But it may start off again any moment, and you would be left stranded\r\non the line.”\r\n\r\nThe officer, poor man, said nothing. He knew his duty. Whatever I might\r\nchoose to do, he must accompany me and share my fate.\r\n\r\nThe inspector at last jumps out, and the cheik, exclaiming, “If you must\r\ngo, you must,” throws me down into the arms of that sturdy and solid\r\nbeing, as you might fling a cat out into the rain. Now fully exposed to\r\nthe “four winds of heaven,” the drenching storm seemed to be tearing my\r\nhair off my head, and I was soon ankle-deep in the thick mud; but the\r\nair was good, and merely to be out of the train banished all fear of\r\nbeing crushed to death in the darkness by some passing steam monster.\r\n\r\nI _ought_ to have braced my nerves with the thought that Turkish women\r\nhave to endure these things; but for some reason the train terrified me.\r\nAs I can justly boast, I was terrified by nothing else in this country.\r\n\r\nThree times they coaxed me back into that choking van (as now and again\r\nthe train shifted along for a few miles), and three times I insisted on\r\nbeing tossed into the storm. It was about two o’clock in the morning\r\nwhen, to the intense relief of all, we actually arrived at our\r\ndestination.\r\n\r\nWe disembark for “positively the last” time at Afioun-Karahissar, where\r\nthe deluge adds its gloom to the now familiar woefulness of a town in\r\nruins. Yet many of the inhabitants are actually sleeping in the mud of\r\nthat awful night.\r\n\r\nWe are driven some way beyond the town, to the one primitive and\r\ntumble-down roof that can possibly offer us shelter. Like most Eastern\r\nhans (_i.e._, inns), it is built round a courtyard, the living-rooms\r\nnext to the stable; but horses are warm and agreeable neighbours. Once\r\nat the front, on a particularly cold and bitter day, the French, who\r\nshrugged their shoulders and refused none of my mad requests, politely\r\nallowed me to travel with the horses!\r\n\r\nWe climb rickety stairs and cross a wooden veranda to examine the\r\nrooms—one with three beds, the other with two. Alas, the former is too\r\nmuch for even the cheik’s philosophy, and he decides for the courtyard.\r\nNeither of the beds in the double room is clean, certainly, but a marked\r\nadvance on the alternative; and, after placing the cheik’s quilt and\r\nprayer-mat _between_ myself and the “men in possession,” and wrapping\r\nmyself up in two thick rugs, I am glad enough to “go to bed in my\r\nboots,” with at least the prospect of “keeping still” for a few hours.\r\nIf a fire _has_ brought out more “visitors” than were obvious at our\r\nfirst inspection, it is still better than traffic “by goods.”\r\n\r\nThe officer is compelled literally to “sit up” all night, as there is no\r\nroom for him to stretch his limbs.\r\n\r\nOn such a night I could have wished for a “smaller” hole in the floor,\r\nand that the “mud” walls had not been quite so badly in need of repair;\r\nyet the shabby and threadbare costume of the “man with our morning tea,”\r\nwas not sordid, but only picturesque.\r\n\r\nThe cheik, like so many men, is an excellent housewife, and when he laid\r\na clean handkerchief upon a large volume for tray, our breakfast of\r\nbread and helva, nuts and fruit, looked quite appetising.\r\n\r\nIt is not the “indolence of the East” that is leaving these people in\r\ndestitution among the ruins. One day, what remains standing will have to\r\nbe pulled or burnt down, and a complete rebuilding undertaken. But\r\nnothing can be done under a threat of war.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt every inn on our return journey the whole of the “service” was\r\nentrusted to men. This, no doubt, largely explains the usual discomfort.\r\nWomen must not remain entirely anonymous.\r\n\r\nThe cheik told me he hoped the new generation, largely educated in\r\nEurope, might welcome such innovations, but “it would be difficult for\r\nthe old. My wife, for instance, complained at having to ‘receive’ men\r\nvisitors in Berlin. She considered it ‘cheap’ and ‘lowering’ to her\r\nprestige.”\r\n\r\nI can only hope the women of Turkey, when they achieve progress, will\r\nadvance on the right lines—more determined on tact than pace.\r\n\r\nOne must, of course, discard conventions at need, as I was doing all the\r\ntime on this journey, but one can, at the same time, respect the\r\nfeelings of others.\r\n\r\nI could not, for convention, allow my present companions to keep up the\r\nfull Eastern “separation of the sexes”; and, as the cheik remarked,\r\nLondon ballrooms would be no less offensive to Turkish ladies of the old\r\nschool than the comparatively “close quarters” which common humanity\r\nforbade us to avoid.\r\n\r\nThere are often, of course, directly opposed conventions in different\r\nclimates. In the Eastern mosques men keep on hats and take off boots;\r\nEuropeans reverse the custom. Eastern women object to “low” frocks and\r\n“strange” partners “for the dance”; and, as one who had joined in them\r\nonce told me, it is better to dance alone; for, if the music suddenly\r\nstops, a “couple” feel so embarrassed!\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe were driven to the station for a train due to leave at 10 in the\r\nmorning, which actually started about 5 P.M.! We had first attempted to\r\nfind room in a third-class compartment with a French colonel, a Turkish\r\nofficer, and two servants. But Europeans, even in Asia Minor, are seldom\r\ninclined to be accommodating, and my “ally” (!) diplomatically expressed\r\nhis desire to be left alone in his glory. “You will be much more\r\ncomfortable, my dear madam, in a less crowded carriage. I fear you could\r\nnot even find a seat among all these officers, and, at least, fifty\r\nboxes.” We were not slow to take the hint.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is no sign of being able to leave the station for some\r\nhours, and the sun is shining for a change. Everyone, naturally, prefers\r\nthe platform; and having learnt, it appears, that I am _not_ married to\r\neither the cheik or the Turkish officer, the colonel approaches me with\r\nrenewed curiosity. When I explain that I am English, he simply answers:\r\n“You mean American?”\r\n\r\n“The one Frenchman and the one Englishwoman in Anatolia,” was my retort,\r\n“have met by chance at a wayside railway station, and you will not even\r\nallow me to enter your carriage. Are _you_ really French?”\r\n\r\n“I should be delighted and honoured if you will come and talk to me,”\r\nwas the would-be gallant reply, “but I have twenty boxes” (he has\r\nquickly disposed of thirty). “I thought at first you were a lady of\r\nsixty.”\r\n\r\n“And numbered your boxes to match my years! I see; after all, you _must_\r\nbe French!”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  H.M. THE KALIPH OF ISLAM.\r\n  A charming gentleman and a distinguished artist.\r\n  p. 112\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe cheik told me that Afioun means “opium,” and Karahissar is the\r\ncentre of that trade, completely paralysed for the moment. When I had\r\ntea with Dame Rachel Crowday at the League of Nations in Geneva, I heard\r\nthat Turkey desired to join the Opium Convention, a striking instance of\r\npublic spirit in a country that needs all the money it can possibly lay\r\nhands on; but the moral welfare of her people counts for more than\r\n“profit” to the State. M. Kemal Pasha, indeed, has shown equal wisdom by\r\nprohibiting the sale of alcohol. In Constantinople it was said, with a\r\ntruly “Western” hauteur: “How can the Turks imagine that they will\r\nsucceed where the United States have made such a failure?”\r\n\r\n“Is that a sound argument” I replied, “for giving them a chance of\r\nbecoming what the States were _before_ prohibition? Americans do not\r\nknow ‘how to drink’; and I am afraid the Turks also might learn to use\r\nalcohol, _not_ as a beverage or a pick-me-up, but just to get drunk.”\r\n\r\nThe strength and endurance of Turkish children, nourished on bread and\r\nwater, must prove of the strongest possible support to prohibition. “And\r\nremember how quickly the Arab’s wounds were healed at the front, while\r\nalcohol was so effective an antidote for septic-poisoning, because it\r\nhad never before even entered their systems.”\r\n\r\nConstantinople had proved a sore affront to my national pride; but there\r\nwas an occasion in Naples when its humiliation was even more complete.\r\n\r\nI was passing a crowd of happy children on the quay, rolling and\r\ntumbling about in some strangely ridiculous fashion. Always keenly\r\ninterested in children’s games (and prayers), I went up to them and\r\nasked what they were doing.\r\n\r\nIt was a game entitled “The drunken Englishman”!\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n        A THIRD-CLASS COMPARTMENT—A FRENCHMAN AMONGST THE RUINS\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER a few miles of such travelling as had now become familiar, I\r\ndetermined that I would change my carriage and pay a visit to the French\r\ncolonel—which proved far more lengthy than I had intended.\r\n\r\nWhen I had manipulated the climb, I found plenty of room in spite of\r\nboxes.\r\n\r\n“What on earth are you doing here?” was his first question, to which I\r\ngave him a _tu quoque_.\r\n\r\n“I am looking after the French interests in Syria,” he replied, an\r\nanswer that could not fail to provoke a laugh.\r\n\r\n“That is well worth noting,” I said, “a parallel to my journey from\r\nLondon to Edinburgh, _via_ Paris! It will make ‘good news’ for the\r\nBritish Foreign Office.”\r\n\r\n“And in what way can it concern them?” was the stiff reply. “Their own\r\nrecord in these parts is not entirely _sans reproche_.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t forget I am an Englishwoman and not, as you insist on saying, an\r\nAmerican.”\r\n\r\n“Is it not practically the same? You speak one language.”\r\n\r\nI started up, almost in anger. “Never dare to say such a thing again. I\r\nmight as well ask whether you were a Senegali. The language is the same.\r\nIndividual Americans, some parts of their country, I consider, are\r\nmagnificent, but their Government!”\r\n\r\n“Will any Government bear close inspection?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps not.”\r\n\r\n“You regard the States precisely as I should expect from an\r\nEnglishwoman. But, after all, what has Great Britain done in Turkey,\r\nafter ‘letting us down’ over ‘reparations’—perfidious Albion!”\r\n\r\n“I may be dense,” I returned (somewhat evasively, I admit), “but what\r\nexactly is the connection between Syria and M. Kemal Pasha?”\r\n\r\n“Everything and nothing,” was the characteristically enigmatic reply.\r\n\r\n“I take that as courteous French for ‘mind your business,’ as charming a\r\nphrase as your _Pourquoi-parceque_.”\r\n\r\nHe supposed that “I had been sent to Angora by the British Government,”\r\nand I promised to send him notes on my conversation with “the\r\nauthorities” at Smyrna.\r\n\r\n“Naturally,” the colonel persisted, “they would _pretend_ they had\r\nnothing to do with your undertaking; but do they not pay your expenses?”\r\n\r\n“I never heard of our Government having _paid_ a woman; I never heard of\r\ntheir even consulting a woman—except Miss Bell—and, according to Colonel\r\nLaurence, her great charm is that everyone takes her for a man!”\r\n\r\nThe colonel laughed.\r\n\r\n“I am absolutely independent; nor shall I send a word to the Press\r\nunless I want to do so.... The Government may exile me or send me to\r\nprison; so may the Turks. But I _shall_ describe _what I see as I see\r\nit_; and if anyone can prove me in error, I will correct my statements\r\nand apologise.\r\n\r\n“So few of us have the courage to write either articles or books in the\r\nspirit of true independence that truth demands. We writers should not be\r\nat the beck and call of newspaper editors. We ought not to respect their\r\npolicy if it offend our conscience or the truth. _They_ should follow\r\nour lead. Had we only had more _esprit de corps_ this terribly false\r\nposition of Great Britain in Anatolia to-day could never have come\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n“If the articles in which I have told the truth are _not_ published you\r\nwill know the reason. The editor has his opinions, and I refuse to\r\nchange mine.”\r\n\r\n“What about the British propaganda?”\r\n\r\n“There is no British propaganda.”\r\n\r\nThe colonel laughed, loud and long. “No country,” he said, “has spent so\r\nmuch on ‘intelligence’ as Great Britain. Gold has been poured from her\r\ncoffers. That is why she has been so badly served.”\r\n\r\n“I entirely agree. We _have_ squandered millions in the Near East—in\r\nPalestine, Mesopotamia, and everywhere else. But towards women no\r\nGovernment has been so mean. It is our own fault; ‘cheap labour’ is\r\nconsidered patriotic; and, after all, the Government could not find the\r\nmoney to squander unless someone was willing to take their pittance.”\r\n\r\n“My dear young lady, the British are rolling in money.”\r\n\r\n“M. Briand told the same tale till I cornered him one day, and then he\r\nsaid: ‘Your country is so rich that she can even afford to give ‘golden’\r\nhair to her women!’”\r\n\r\n“Well,” he replied, “I can but admire you—to have undertaken such a\r\njourney, at such a time, without the backing of your Government or the\r\nPress—and all for no purpose!”\r\n\r\n“You are frank,” I said with a smile. “Do you think I could have\r\naccomplished more with the financial backing that your women can always\r\ncommand from your Government?”\r\n\r\n“I cannot understand your Government.”\r\n\r\n“Neither can I.... That’s why I am here.... Do you remember the Bible\r\nstory of a city offered salvation if but _one_ righteous and upright man\r\ncould be found within her gates? So, God willing, may I, as _one_\r\nEnglishwoman and a friend, preserve for my country some last shred of\r\nrespect and faith in our honour among the Moslems of Turkey and India,\r\nEgypt, Persia, and Palestine.”\r\n\r\nCourtesy, I suppose, kept him silent, and we were soon busy with\r\npreparations for dinner. He produced a towel for serviette, a piece of\r\nnewspaper for table-cloth, and—luxury of luxuries—a knife, a fork, and a\r\nmug in which to enjoy some good French wine! The menu, too, was a\r\nchange: _foie gras_ and sardines, almonds and figs, apples and jam.\r\n\r\n“I shall come and dine with you again,” said I, lest he should be too\r\nshy to invite me.\r\n\r\nI found that the colonel and his staff could fully sympathise, from\r\ntheir own experience, with my anathemas upon luggage traffic. I told him\r\n“no doubt it was he and his friends who were making those awful ‘night\r\nnoises’ that so alarmed me”; and though, of course, he denied it, my\r\nstory received the tribute of a polite and good-natured laugh.\r\n\r\n“I admire your courage,” he said again.\r\n\r\n“Reserve your judgment. You will have time enough to see later what a\r\ncombative person I can be.”\r\n\r\n“_Nous verrons._”\r\n\r\nWe reached Eski-Chéir at about nine o’clock, and a telegram announced to\r\nthe colonel that a special private car was on its way to meet him.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said he, “I can offer hospitality, not only to you, but to your\r\nfriends as well.”\r\n\r\nWe went to a café for tea, where numbers of Turks, wearing kalpaks, were\r\nsinging patriotic songs. Directly they had finished, I clapped my hands,\r\ncrying: “M. Kemal Pasha, _Chok Guzel_,” and their delight was obvious.\r\n\r\n“Poor fellows,” said the colonel, whom I began to find sympathetic, “it\r\nneeds such a tiny effort; they will respond to the least hint of real\r\nsympathy.”\r\n\r\nThere is nothing sordid about this little tumble-down café, though its\r\nfloors are thick with mud and the attendants are charmingly shabby. “At\r\nleast,” I said, “this dirt and discomfort is artistic.... What artist\r\nwould dream of painting an American sky-scraper, luxurious and\r\ncomfortable though it be? Yet here one could cover the walls of an\r\nexhibition from one day’s experience. The picturesque water-pots, the\r\nquaint trays, the artistic tea-glasses and coffee-cups, the colouring of\r\nthe costumes.\r\n\r\n“If Mr. Chester of the U.S. has come here to sweep away all this he is\r\nan enemy of Art.\r\n\r\n“I love creature comforts—warmth, baths, and perfumes, but I sincerely\r\ntrust no fever of reform will ever induce the Turks to spoil their\r\nsurroundings; and, above all, that they will never call in American\r\nspecialists to teach them building achievements. By all means let them\r\nadopt American hygiene; but American architecture, God forbid!\r\n\r\n“I will pay honour where honour is due. To all who have so nobly\r\nperpetuated the work of Florence Nightingale I bow the knee. But what\r\nwill American innovations do for Turkey?\r\n\r\n“In the East End of New York, America’s melting-pot, I once saw a\r\npicturesque old Jew reading Spinoza in the original, as he sat absorbed\r\non the sidewalk. His velvet cap was old and shabby, the long grizzly\r\nbeard maybe none too clean; but in the primitive robes of his ancient\r\nrace he looked a true Oriental.\r\n\r\n“Then appeared his ‘American son’—a ‘Bowery’ accent, many smart rings, a\r\ncostly gold watchchain across his brightly-coloured waistcoat, spats and\r\npatents, and a ‘time is money’ expression on his alert face. Which of\r\nthe generations would you prefer?\r\n\r\n“If the Turk ever asks our advice, I sincerely hope no ‘counsels from\r\nEurope’ will ever replace the artistic traditions of the East....\r\nEuropeanised Turks are not the ‘best’ Turks.\r\n\r\n“You have already, alas, in the Hippodrome at Constantinople, that\r\ncheap, ‘made in Germany’ monstrosity of a fountain, which the\r\nonce-mighty Emperor William bequeathed to you as the ‘souvenir’ of a\r\nvisit to ‘his brother,’ Abdul Hamid! Why has war left it untouched?”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was a strange comfort to compare the happy faces of these men with\r\nthose one knew under the late Sultans. In those days, two or three\r\nmeeting together in a café were always in fear of arrest as\r\n“suspects.” I remember what songs broke forth on the Night of the\r\nConstitution—funereal, indeed, they sounded to our thinking, but such\r\n_are_ their songs of joy.\r\n\r\nThen they sang for joy, since “freedom” was too new a thing for serious\r\ncontentment; oppression had only just been lifted, the sense of security\r\nhad not arrived. Now, in the sure knowledge of freedom from the Greeks\r\nand from Imperial rule, they sit, calm and confident and well satisfied,\r\nno longer an Emperor’s slaves, but citizens of a Free State. Can one\r\nwonder that every one of them would die rather than lose one inch of the\r\nliberty so bravely won?\r\n\r\n“Please tell them,” I asked the officer, “that I have been in Turkey for\r\nevery crisis of progress in recent history, and that none has filled me\r\nwith such proud delight as the victory of M. Kemal Pasha. I am here\r\nto-day to offer him my congratulations.”\r\n\r\nThe colonel politely remarked that it would have been only “prudent”\r\nspeculation for the British Government to have despatched me upon the\r\nmission I had undertaken for myself.\r\n\r\nI thought how well it would be for many of my compatriots to do similar\r\nwork in other lands. It may be against all our traditions, but\r\n“propaganda” could now do much for England. Here, on the brink of war,\r\nwhere all men were filled with righteous indignation against us, I have\r\nat least been able to leave a “better impression” of my country in\r\nwayside cafés and many Turkish homes.\r\n\r\nYet, as official language would express it, I have not “licked the boots\r\nof the Turks,” and everywhere I have been treated with the true courtesy\r\nof the chivalrous. May the experience not prove to have laid the\r\nfoundation of a new and interesting career for women? To explain in all\r\nlands, and to all envious or hostile peoples, the true greatness of the\r\nBritish Empire, will not be work in vain.\r\n\r\nSince my return I have been frequently asked to explain the rôle of the\r\nFrench colonel in Angora. I cannot feel that his presence implied any\r\ndisloyalty to Great Britain. Again and again we have been asked by\r\nFrance to modify our policy in the Near East. But as neither threats nor\r\ncoaxing has availed to save us from being the tools of designing Greece,\r\nFrance was driven to “make her own arrangements.”\r\n\r\nI do not say that she abandoned Cilicia simply for conscience’ sake, or\r\nthat she gave back that rich cotton district to Turkey from a pure love\r\nof justice. But I am ready to congratulate her on the wisdom of retiring\r\nbefore she was driven out. We must obviously own that Angora is not on\r\nthe direct road back to Syria, and that the colonel has lingered some\r\nmonths by the way. That, however, is really his own business; and I do\r\nnot forget that I, too, once went to Turkey for six weeks and stayed six\r\nmonths! No doubt he is no less welcome to M. Kemal Pasha than I was to\r\nthe Grand Vizier’s daughter.\r\n\r\nHe certainly proved an invaluable source of information. As I told him,\r\n“he must have telegraphed to his Government every time he heard the\r\nPasha sneeze”; and, emphatically, he has done good work. Honest,\r\nupright, and sincere, he can “explain many things” to the Turks, and\r\nassist them with tactful advice. At the worst, he has harmed no one,\r\nwhich cannot be said of all diplomatists in Constantinople!\r\n\r\nI, personally, can respect those with whom I do not agree, even those\r\nwho, on behalf of their own country, dislike mine. It would surely have\r\nbeen more prudent to _follow_ the French example, by having a\r\nrepresentative in Angora, than to criticise them. Suspicion leads\r\nnowhere, and such a man as General Harington “on the spot” could have\r\ndone a great deal to hasten peace.\r\n\r\nFrance has no desire, or, at least, no considered campaign, to undermine\r\nour influence in the East; and the colonel, at any rate, was quite aware\r\nthat, whatever the gratitude Turkey may owe and feel to her, it is\r\nEngland who will soon (once more) hold the first place in Turkey’s\r\naffections. The terrible and tragic bunglings of these last years will\r\nthen be forgotten.\r\n\r\nThey have told me themselves that M. Franklin-Bouillon did all he could\r\nto advise them to preserve good relations with England.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe car arrived about eleven o’clock, and though we were driven to spend\r\nthe night in the station (a junction between HAÏDAR Pasha, Angora and\r\nSmyrna); though the wind howled over the beating rain, and the train\r\nshrieked in the distance, the contrast of so much comfort (on the\r\nluxurious couch of a roomy car) with the experience of the previous\r\nnight, made one feel that the discomfort itself had been worth while.\r\n\r\nAs the colonel, the cheik and the officers in turn brought me a glass of\r\ntea by way of nightcap, I said to each: “How good it is to be here!”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n     IN THE “TRAIN DE LUXE”—THE SUPREME GOOD FELLOWSHIP OF ENGLISH\r\n          LAUGHTER—JOURNEYING TOWARDS THE CRADLE OF NEW TURKEY\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was well past ten when I woke next morning. Though the sun was\r\nblazing through the uncurtained windows, I had slept undisturbed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A Battle Royal with my Tangled, Dusty Hair.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThere had, of course, been no chance of “undressing for the night.” But\r\nI had been able to take off my boots, and having a whole compartment to\r\nmyself, I was only too glad to take out my wire brush for the luxury of\r\na “battle royal” with my tangled and dusty hair.\r\n\r\nI was still only half awake and far too tired to think of _les\r\nconvenances_, when a smiling crowd of excited and gesticulating\r\nTurks suddenly appeared on the platform. Truth to tell, the\r\nsix-days-and-five-nights’ journey seemed like an eternity. I had\r\nforgotten Smyrna—almost forgotten the war. Were these happy children\r\nthe “enemies” of my country?\r\n\r\nA tactful little bird now reminded me that Turks are not used to the\r\nvision of ladies “at the toilette,” and it was, perhaps, a somewhat\r\nperverse form of gratitude that tempted me to fill my rubber basin from\r\nmy host’s bottle of Evian in order to wash my hands “under the table.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A Bottle of Evian—Under the Table.\r\n]\r\n\r\nDespite haste and discretion, however, I experienced an unusual sense of\r\nbeing dressed and clean, as I eventually stepped out into the daylight\r\nto make the acquaintance of Eski-Chéir.\r\n\r\nI found the colonel on the platform talking with animation to a\r\nnice-looking Turkish general, who also, it appeared, had a saloon, to\r\nwhich we all three soon adjourned for coffee and talk. He, too, will\r\nscarcely believe that I am English.... “I did not think Englishwomen\r\ncould laugh so heartily,” was his excuse for scepticism.\r\n\r\n“My dear sir,” I replied, “I was born laughing, and shall keep it up to\r\nthe bitter end. God has given me a few gifts—not many—and that for which\r\nI give most thanks is a keen sense of humour.”\r\n\r\nSo I trotted out all the experiences of my journey one by one, not\r\nforgetting the Greek I had to “shake” at Athens, and the Frenchman in\r\nthe “Caracole.” Convulsed with laughter, they one and all shouted: “She\r\nis _not_ English!”\r\n\r\nThis strange impression of our race prevails, I know, also in France and\r\nAmerica. They forget Shakespeare’s Falstaff and the supreme “good\r\nfellowship of English laughter.” French wit, no doubt, reveals the swift\r\nplay of a keener and more subtle intellect; ours is a “midsummer\r\nmadness” of warm hearts in the Forests of Arden.\r\n\r\nFor my part, when the “literature” mistress challenged her class to\r\n“hunt for humour” in “Julius Cæsar,” I put my finger upon the Stage\r\nDirection—“Enter Cæsar in his nightgown!” I could not then, nor can I\r\nnow, agree that Brutus’s wife’s distracted hurrying away, and then\r\nrecalling, the page for news of his master is anything but tragic\r\npathos.\r\n\r\nFew nations, again, will enjoy as we do a joke against themselves. When\r\nI published a “Turkish Woman’s Impressions of Europe,” about ten years\r\nago, in which she so happily hit off the weakness of our Western\r\ncivilisations, the Continent was up in arms. It was an _English_ critic\r\nwho gaily expressed his “most sincere thanks” for so “thorough a\r\ndressing-down.” No publisher in the States would take the following\r\nbook, with Americans as “victims,” for fear of his “sensitive” and\r\n“patriotic” (!) readers.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt a half-ruined restaurant near the station, over the most excellent\r\nmeal I ever tasted in such miserable surroundings, we had a long talk\r\nwith General Mouedine Pasha and his two sons about politics and some\r\ncurious stories they had heard somewhere about England. It is natural\r\nthat these men should not be interested in any other subject. The\r\ngeneral, he told us, had been in and out of prison for the last fifteen\r\nyears—exiled by Abdul Hamid, escaping, and caught again. After the\r\nArmistice he left Constantinople, at great personal risk, to join M.\r\nKemal Pasha; was, for a time, Governor of Adana, and is now taking up\r\nhis post as Ambassador at Teheran. Most of the leading soldier\r\nNationalists—M. Kemal Pasha and Fethi Bey among the rest—seem to have\r\nbeen his grateful pupils, and, naturally, he is a proud man to-day.\r\n\r\nIf only the authorities at Lausanne had known or could imagine anything\r\nabout life in Angora during the last three years! All the best men\r\nexiled, persecuted, and imprisoned. What wonder that Nationalism had\r\ngrown into a religion!\r\n\r\nHe was indignant at the suggestion that French officers, or a British\r\nstrategist, were “wanted” in the Turkish Army. “My pupils,” he said,\r\n“are more fitted to _give_ instruction than to receive it....\r\n\r\n“The buying and selling of munitions, the haggling and bargaining\r\nintroduced in the army—all that ought _not_ to be—came from Germany.”\r\n\r\nHe was not the _only_ “big man” in Turkey to lose faith in their\r\nwar-ally, or to recognise some compensation for their terrible defeat in\r\nthe freedom from Teuton rule that it involved; but they are not,\r\ntherefore, any more kindly disposed to the yoke of “the Allies.”\r\n\r\nEski-Chéir had been one of the most flourishing towns in Anatolia, and\r\nwas destined from its position as a junction between two big railway\r\nlines—Angora and Baghdad—to become more prosperous year by year. Every\r\ntown, of course, has its own story of looting, “violation of women,” and\r\nfire; but to the spectator all now seem very much alike, and what\r\nchiefly impressed one here was the amazing rapidity with which it had\r\nstarted to recover.\r\n\r\nIf the produce be only lifted from the backs of patient and sure-footed\r\ndonkeys on to the Mother Earth, it is, after all, extraordinary that\r\nthere should yet be any produce left. Peasants ready to walk miles along\r\nmuddy roads to sell their goods in such small quantities for so little\r\nprofit will scarcely welcome the cost of transport by modern methods.\r\nFor them, time is _not_ money, and four weeks’ tramp beside a donkey is\r\nfar cheaper than a few hours by train.\r\n\r\nIt surprised me to find the curio-merchants already again supplied with\r\ntheir tempting wares: mother-o’-pearl ikons and other relics, old\r\ncoffee-mills, coral seals, cameos, etc. Trade was fairly brisk, being\r\nrun on the sound basis of quick profits and small returns, fair prices\r\nand honest dealing.\r\n\r\nThe attractions, of course, come nowhere near those of the famous bazaar\r\nat Constantinople; but I was grateful to find so little haggling over\r\nthe price. I remember two types of merchants at Constantinople. One\r\nkindly-looking old man with a long white beard was sitting cross-legged\r\nover his charcoal fire, making himself a cup of coffee. When I inquired\r\nabout a fine Persian dressing-gown that took my fancy, he simply\r\nanswered: “Much too dear for you,” and so dismissed me. The other always\r\nasked for three times what he was prepared to accept—a most irritating\r\nhabit. When I visited the bazaar in Turkish dress, my Turkish sister, of\r\ncourse a real Turk, asked if he really found he _could_ rob people in\r\nthis way. “I never rob Turks,” was the naïve reply, “only the English\r\nand the Americans.” The temptation to disclose my nationality was\r\nstrong, but in those less liberal days it might have meant “trouble” for\r\nmy friend.\r\n\r\nHere I soon saw it would be waste of time to visit _any_ bazaar after\r\nthe French colonel. He counts it a day wasted if he has not found some\r\ntreasures, which are all sent for him to Paris.... “Poor man,” as my\r\nfriend the innkeeper would have remarked, “he is so far from home!”\r\n\r\nIn Eski-Chéir before the fire, however, art had been altogether put away\r\nfor munitions. The factories worked day and night, cannons and lorries\r\nin readiness all the time. One day we shall learn something at least of\r\nthe ceaseless efforts by which victory was snatched out of nothing.\r\n\r\nWe left the town at about ten o’clock in the evening. At last we are\r\nactually _en route_ for Angora. “I cannot even yet quite believe,” said\r\nI, “that I am really starting, that I shall really arrive.” I heard that\r\nsome American women (more enterprising, or less expensive, than their\r\nconfrères) have reached Ismidt, but can get no further.\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, “hard-going,” and I believe that the colonel’s “salon”\r\nonly just came in time. I was told, four years ago, by the eminent Jean\r\nLouis Faure, that _if_ I survived at all it would be as a permanent and\r\ncomplete invalid. Yet I have faced more since then than most “strong”\r\npeople would care to attempt.\r\n\r\nThe Turks, remember, who could not obtain or afford a yaili (the native\r\ncarriage) were driven to “walk” the eight hundred miles to Angora in a\r\nclimate that more than doubles the strain on one’s physique.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs soon as we meet new faces, the questions about Lloyd George all begin\r\nover again.\r\n\r\nI told the story of _Les Misérables_. How the ambitious Welsh lad and\r\nhis uncle, the village cobbler, “worked at the French” together in the\r\nold days, one looking out “what a word meant” in the dictionary, the\r\nother discovering how to pronounce it. Mr. Lloyd George had often\r\ndeclared that the policy of his whole career came straight from his\r\nfirst study of that immortal classic—“to devote his life to helping the\r\n‘under dog.’”\r\n\r\nPerhaps he has lost the copy of _Les Misérables_ he used always to carry\r\nwith him, and so missed the road to that magnificent goal; so, at least,\r\nit seemed to my Turkish audience. “That is the man, a democrat who could\r\nunderstand and appreciate our fight for freedom; what has driven him to\r\nhate us?”\r\n\r\nI could only repeat such “explanation” as I had been able to offer\r\nbefore to their compatriots of the mountains.\r\n\r\nThe colonel was kind enough to suggest how much I might have saved\r\nEngland had I been here a year ago.\r\n\r\n“It is very doubtful,” I answered, “whether I could have done much, even\r\nthen. Our Government makes up its own mind without listening to outside\r\ninformation. As a matter of fact, Colonel Aubrey Herbert, a _recognised_\r\nauthority on the Near East, called twice at 10, Downing Street, to urge\r\nthat very scheme upon the Premier’s private secretary, Mr. Philip Kerr,\r\nbut they preferred to keep me in England.”\r\n\r\n“But why is your ‘intelligence’ so badly managed?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“What evidence can you produce for such an assumption?” was my retort.\r\n\r\n“There could surely be no other explanation of your leaving the Greeks\r\nwithout support ... unless, indeed, they are right who whisper that Mr.\r\nLloyd George actually wanted the opposing armies to exterminate each\r\nother. His conduct, certainly, lent colour to the charge.”\r\n\r\nBut I refused to be drawn.... “‘Intelligence’ is not my province,” I\r\nanswered, “although I _can_ say that the Turks were not served much\r\nbetter in that respect.... They won by ‘faith’; what we of the West call\r\n‘superstition.’”\r\n\r\nI was able to more or less look after the son of an eminent Turkish lady\r\nwriter during his studies in Paris, just after the Treaty of Sèvres. His\r\nfather, one of the leading Governors under the last administration, had\r\ngiven up all to follow M. Kemal Pasha. When I asked the boy whether they\r\nhad any hope of success, he just flashed out: “They _must_ succeed. His\r\nstars are ‘right.’ He _could_ not fail!”\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Turkish diplomats, one and all, declared he would\r\nfail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GENERAL MOUEDDINE PASHA.\r\n  MILITARY INSTRUCTOR OF MUSTAPHA KEMAL PASHA.\r\n  TURKISH AMBASSADOR AT TEHERAN (PERSIA).\r\n  p. 128\r\n]\r\n\r\n“Must such splendid efforts be thrown away?” I sadly answered; “are\r\nthere _no_ circumstances that _might_ arise to justify at least some\r\nhope?”\r\n\r\n“My dear lady,” was the courteous and grave reply, “we _wish_ him\r\nsuccess, as you do; but you have too much good sense to believe in fairy\r\ntales. The Pasha has neither money nor munitions. He has the Greeks\r\n(well supported by the Allies and the Sultan) against him on the north,\r\nthe Armenians on the east, the French on the south. He will put up a\r\nbrave fight and perish in the attempt. The days of miracles are past.”\r\nBut the miracle happened!\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd now, as the train followed the line of the victorious army, our\r\nyoung men took out their maps and eagerly pointed out to us these, now\r\nalmost sacred, landmarks. Their father, at the same time, explained many\r\ntechnical details—why such and such a position could not be maintained,\r\nwhere the Greek strategy had failed, how General Trécoupis (now\r\nthankful, no doubt, to be in the Turks’ hands at Eski-Chéir) had\r\nsurrendered to a mere lieutenant.\r\n\r\nBy way of return for all this interesting information, I told a few\r\nsimple stories about the Royal Family of Great Britain, which I have\r\nalways found interest these people far more than my “grander,” or more\r\nromantic, reminiscences from the Courts of Europe.\r\n\r\nThey are never tired of hearing that our Edward VII. only required _one_\r\n“gentleman in waiting” at a time at Marienbad; whereas the Czar\r\n(Ferdinand) of Bulgaria was always accompanied by a suite of eight or\r\nnine. Sir Edward Goschen was instructed to dress, like his royal master,\r\nin a green Tyrolese hat with its little shooting feather. He was sent to\r\nsit on “the king’s bench” until the crowd had satisfied their natural\r\ndesires for “a good view,” and gone home to breakfast. _Then_ Edward\r\nVII. himself arrived.\r\n\r\nI went on to tell of a Wagner concert, so crowded that a certain little\r\nAmerican lady of about seventy quietly settled into the only empty seat\r\nthat the King’s attendant just happened to have vacated. She simply\r\n“refused to believe” the scandalised authorities when they told her that\r\nshe was sitting beside the King of England. Edward enjoyed the joke,\r\nwould not allow “his friend,” to be disturbed, and chattered merrily to\r\nher between the music to the end of the programme.\r\n\r\nHer countrywomen, in Ascot gowns, driving their four-horse carriages up\r\nto the golf-course at Marienbad, _in search of_ an introduction, did not\r\nfind His Majesty so easy to approach. The most determined of them all\r\n(up against something that “money” could not buy) was driven to use her\r\nscissors to cut off a few hairs from his dog’s tail. “At least,” she\r\nsaid, “if I have no souvenir of the King of England, I have a bit of his\r\ndog,” and she mounted the hairs in a locket and wore it until she died.\r\n\r\n“You see,” I concluded, “how much these ‘democrats’ admire a king. Will\r\nthe fever, I wonder, ever take root in the East?”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the Sakharia, the eyes of the general were filled with\r\ntears, and it was some time before he managed to speak of what _had\r\nbeen_. It seemed, indeed, too good to be true. The Greeks had penetrated\r\nto Sakharia; and now they were driven out of the whole country!\r\n\r\n“Without our Pasha,” said he, “we should still be slaves. To-day, none\r\ndare fail in duty to our Fatherland!”\r\n\r\nThey were all this man’s pupils, these Nationalist leaders. To his fine,\r\nupright character they owe an example they are proud to acknowledge. His\r\nsons told me that he was in exile for six years, and they had no idea\r\nwhere he was! It was easy to see how they admired him and how devoted he\r\nwas to them; and now his work at Teheran will not be easy; such men give\r\ntheir whole lives to service!\r\n\r\nWe have travelled quickly and comfortably over this desolate country;\r\nthe little engine, _stoked with wood_, is tugging its long burden up the\r\nlong heights.\r\n\r\n“Look,” said the colonel, “there is Angora.”\r\n\r\n“That little village perched on a hill?”\r\n\r\n“It is not a village,” he corrected, “it is a town.”\r\n\r\nYet somehow I felt this was not what I had expected ... “such a tiny\r\nspeck of a place to bear so great a name!”\r\n\r\nWell, I had my first peep at that which I had come so far to see—the\r\ncradle of the New Turkey. Soon I shall meet the hero of the\r\nNationalists!\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n    ANGORA I.—ENTERING A “BROTHERHOOD”—AN ATMOSPHERE OF CAMARADERIE\r\n\r\n\r\n“WELL, what did you expect to see?” asked the colonel.\r\n\r\n“Really, I don’t know exactly,” said I, “but something different.... I\r\nsuppose I am foolish enough to look for some sort of likeness to our\r\nWestern towns.... There is a certain resemblance in parts to a town in\r\nthe Rhondda Valley, except that the Welsh mining districts are sordid\r\nand this is picturesque.”\r\n\r\n“Why not leave it as it is,” said the colonel—“unique and impossible to\r\nclassify? Begin your explorations at my house, where you can enjoy\r\nanother glass of warm tea.”\r\n\r\nThis, in fact, was the first house I entered, and the last I left, in\r\nAngora.\r\n\r\nOn a crowded platform—for the arrival of a train is an event—stood a\r\nChef de Cabinet of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other officials.\r\nThe Prime Minister embraced his old friend the cheik, and carried him\r\noff to his simple two-roomed dwelling.\r\n\r\nWhen I met Fethi Bey in London, it seemed incredible that he should have\r\nbeen treated as an enemy and exiled to Malta. Now that I came to know\r\nRauf Bey, it was impossible not to feel the same. Away in these distant\r\nmountains, he speaks the most excellent English, without even an accent.\r\n\r\nI remember a merchant of Smyrna, who complained to me that “these\r\nhorrible people expect us to learn their language, to speak and write\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“And why not?” I answered. “They learn ours.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that’s quite different. Besides, Turkish is much too difficult.”\r\n\r\nI reminded him of Mrs. John Burns. When her husband became a Cabinet\r\nMinister, a certain fine lady decided to amuse herself by inviting “the\r\nman’s wife” to tea. Her note ran: “Do excuse my not having called on\r\nyou. It is so far for me to come from Mayfair to Battersea.” Mrs. Burns\r\nreplied: “It is exactly the same distance from Battersea to Mayfair.”\r\n\r\n“That is a charming story, but it will not persuade me to learn\r\nTurkish.”\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister, for some reason wearing a fez in place of the\r\npicturesque kalpak, brought me apologies for Fethi Bey’s absence. “It is\r\nFriday, and he has not been to the office all day.” We had all forgotten\r\nthat it was the Moslem Sunday.\r\n\r\n“Now we are going to be friends,” I said later to Rauf Bey, “we must\r\narrange ‘the same day’ for our prayers of thanksgiving for peace.”\r\n\r\n“It is you who will have to change,” he replied, smiling; “you must\r\nlearn to go our ways now.”\r\n\r\nHere, indeed, at this far-away little station, one seemed to be entering\r\nsome kindly “brotherhood.” Everyone was wringing the colonel’s hand,\r\nembracing the general and the cheik. I felt, too, that my\r\nfellow-passengers were telling them about “a new member” they wanted to\r\nintroduce, saying heartily: “She will soon know all about the rules of\r\nour club.” Everyone here plainly “stood for” the same ideals. We are\r\ntalking like friends already, without the formality of an introduction.\r\nWe are all working for a definite and well-defined goal. Houses are\r\nscarcely needed for hospitality in a town with this atmosphere of\r\n_camaraderie_.\r\n\r\nI found myself chatting with the Prime Minister as though we were old\r\nmembers of the same club. When, a few minutes later, I described the\r\nunconscious influence to the colonel, he only said to his friends: “See\r\nhow quickly she catches the atmosphere of this delightful place!”\r\n\r\nHere it is sympathy with Turkey in her bid for freedom that gives one\r\nthe _entré_ to the society, as in London one gains admission to the\r\nclub, in my case for example, as a writer of books. There is no sense of\r\nsuspicion. You feel you have a right to be here all the time. If you\r\nwere not _trusted_ you would not be allowed over the threshold.\r\n\r\nSoldiers and refugees, officers and deputies, they are all on the\r\nplatform. Everybody has seen us, everybody has greeted us; next morning\r\nthe kindest little paragraph of welcome appears in the newspapers. I\r\nhave completely forgotten the war!\r\n\r\nThe colonel lives on the first floor of what was in the “beginning of\r\ndays” the Station Hotel. M. Kemal Pasha himself lived there for a time,\r\nand now it is the “French Embassy.” Fortunately, the colonel has\r\nschooled himself into _imagining_ a house is warm, whatever the\r\ntemperature; and I found him very comfortably installed, with plenty of\r\nfresh air and a fine open view. Within, however, there were, except in\r\nthe bureau, no rugs or carpets on the bare boards.\r\n\r\nTo secure the luxury of a European wash, I decided to spend the night in\r\nthe station, where the young secretary gladly gave up his room to me,\r\nmaking a bedroom of the bureau for himself and the colonel’s\r\naide-de-camp, Captain Hikmet Bey, after we had all enjoyed a very\r\nappetising little meal.\r\n\r\nThe “Catholic” servant, however, was frankly annoyed at having to wait\r\non an Englishwoman—“that hateful intriguing race that killed my\r\nhusband!” He was killed, as a matter of fact, by the Greeks, but we are,\r\nnot unnaturally, held responsible, and once more I realised how little\r\n“brotherhood” there exists between Christians. I confess it is always\r\nwith an effort that I remember Armenians _are_ Christians. In the end,\r\nhowever, Marie decided that I was not really English, and we became the\r\nbest of friends. When I left Angora she shed many tears, kissing my\r\nhand, placing it against her forehead in the picturesque custom of her\r\nrace, and begging me to come back soon.\r\n\r\nWhen I handed her my rubber hot-bottle, she apparently supposed I did\r\nnot care to use the jug which already stood on the table, and filled it\r\nwith _cold_ water! When she understood that the water must be hot, she\r\nbrought it back to me to wait and watch what I would do with it. The\r\nidea of putting it in my bed made her laugh heartily; and then she\r\ndecided to sit down and see whatever would happen next!\r\n\r\nBut I was tired, and, with none to interpret, began to wonder how I\r\ncould send her away. My phrase-book, as usual, did not provide the clue,\r\nso I merely pointed to the door, saying _kapou_ (a door), which luckily\r\nhad the desired effect. But she was back again as soon as she dared in\r\nthe morning, to enjoy more laughter at the sight of the hot-bottle by my\r\nside.\r\n\r\nThe principal road from the station to “Holy Angora” is wide enough for\r\nthree or four carts to pass.\r\n\r\nHere are two-horse carriages, their primitive harness decorated with\r\nturquoise beads, driven by picturesque, shabby Arabaje (_i.e._,\r\ncoachmen) in turbans of many colours. Also the yaili, so called from\r\ntheir springs, and the famous Anatolian log-carriages, drawn by\r\nbullocks. By the _side_ of the road, sunk in the snow or mud, are the\r\nheavy carts drawn by buffaloes and driven by women, who wear the large,\r\nbaggy, Anatolian trousers, and conceal their hair beneath a scarf. Their\r\nclothes, poor souls, are so nearly covered with patches that some of\r\nthem seem “all patch.” The men all wear kalpaks, and we see the peasants\r\n(men and women) riding their laden donkeys or trudging along beside\r\nbeasts as patient as themselves. They look as though they had walked\r\nstraight out of the Bible.\r\n\r\nThe main road passes the Grand National Assembly on the way to the few\r\nshops. The restaurants make a fair show of Turkish delicacies, like your\r\nekmek-kadaïf, and kébab. We pass two hans (_i.e._, inns) as primitive in\r\ncomfort as appearance, built of mud in which large holes can be seen,\r\nand full of danger to the unwary on their rickety staircases. The\r\n“commercials” in their yailis, on camels or donkeys, however, can find\r\nno other or better accommodation. There are pictures of Ghazi Pasha all\r\nover the town, and in one or two bookshops you can also buy his\r\nprincipal colleagues, patriotic postcards, and other “Nationalist”\r\npictures in gaudy colours.\r\n\r\nAt quaint little booths in the market-place we find a tempting array of\r\nfruit, vegetables, and meat, bread and cheese, raisins, nuts, and boots!\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, we reach a few dwelling-houses of wood, stone, or mud that\r\ndo not seem to have been built on any plan, and now look more irregular\r\nthan ever because of the huge “gap” on the hillside caused, of course,\r\nby the usual fire!\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  The Market-place at Angora.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe weatherbeaten mud and thatch dwellings are whitewashed inside, and\r\nhave plain wooden doors with handsome knockers and quaint, huge locks.\r\nThey are mostly heated by mangals of burning charcoal that give out\r\npoisonous fumes. However, the wood-stoves are not much better, as they\r\nquickly produce an intense heat and then die down as quickly, besides\r\nthe danger of setting the whole place on fire.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to find one’s way in Angora, but the coachmen are\r\nwonderful. They “take” anything in their headlong course, so that one is\r\nconstantly jolted out of one’s seat as the carriages swing from angle to\r\nangle, up and down the steep slopes. To start from the Ottoman Bank on a\r\nwet day requires a double dose of fatalism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  “The carriages swing from angle to angle.”\r\n]\r\n\r\nIsmet Pasha was much amused when I told him that I always said my\r\nprayers before starting out for a drive, and uttered some “holy\r\nejaculation” every five minutes of the way. Even a handsome car like M.\r\nKemal Pasha’s can be seen dancing about like Shakespeare’s elf—“over\r\nhill, over dale, through bush, through briar!” A chauffeur who can pilot\r\nyou through Angora could negotiate any country under the sun.\r\n\r\nIt was as well, perhaps, that my host, Feszi Bey, had arranged for me to\r\nbe driven to his house under the cover of darkness, when pitfalls were\r\nnot so obvious. He is Minister of Public Works, and was at the moment\r\nattending the debate on the dethronement of the Sultan. As none of his\r\nfamily speak French, Osman Noury Bey, of the Ottoman Bank, had been\r\ninstructed to act as my escort, and we found them all in the\r\nsitting-room, with its lattice windows at each end, round as large a\r\nfire as it was safe to have. The heat was almost overpowering after our\r\nbrisk drive in the night air.\r\n\r\nOsman Noury Bey was obliged to leave me on the threshold, as he could\r\nnot enter the women’s apartments. While the _harīm_ and sex-separation\r\nare not now rigidly enforced by the most educated Turks, they have not\r\nby any means yet disappeared. I found that the whole “woman” question\r\nwas really on much the same footing in Anatolia as in other countries;\r\nthat is, “liberty” varies with education, upbringing, and surroundings.\r\nIn this house the women were closely veiled and dependent upon their own\r\nsex for all their pleasures and companionships. Osman Bey himself is\r\nthoroughly liberal-minded and would have allowed his wife full freedom,\r\nprovided only her hair was covered, but she goes out very little and\r\nclearly prefers the old ways.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the wife of Djavid Bey, ex-Minister of Finance, goes\r\nto private dances; while Halidé Hanoum goes everywhere and has mixed\r\nfreely with men for many years. Yet I, a woman, have never seen her hair\r\nunveiled.\r\n\r\nWhile we were waiting for my host’s return, I did my best to “make\r\nconversation” by signs and gestures, and was really surprised at my\r\nsuccess. You can convey far more than one would suppose when you\r\nseriously endeavour to _make_ your company understand. I had my book,\r\ntoo, of “conversations in Turkish,” and so managed to remark: “The house\r\nis large—the fire is warm—I like a warm fire.” Had I depended upon the\r\nwomen in Turkey, I might soon have learned something of their language.\r\n\r\nOur host arrives, and he is kindness and courtesy itself.\r\n\r\nAt about half-past nine, his Excellency asked me when I would like to\r\ndine.\r\n\r\n“Whenever you are ready,” I replied.\r\n\r\n“Oh, no,” was the courteous reply, “it is when _you_ are ready. _Vous\r\nmaître maison, moi votre service._” Too charming a thought for one to\r\nexamine the accuracy of the language!\r\n\r\nHe was always amused to see me “hunting” in the dictionary; and as I\r\ncould _never_ get used to “beginning at the end and reading backwards,”\r\nmy most painstaking researches often produced strange results.\r\n\r\nLike most of the Nationalist ministers, Feszi Bey is a man of about\r\nforty, tall, well-built, dark, with large dark eyes. He is one of the\r\nrichest men in Asia Minor, owning about eighteen villages in Diarbékir,\r\nand is immensely proud of his sons. His house in Constantinople was\r\n“requisitioned” for English officers and left almost in ruins; but he\r\nhas large estates and many houses in his native land. Here, in Angora,\r\nhe was paying what seemed to be a heavy rent for somewhere to live,\r\nconsidering the scanty furniture and lack of comforts in this house.\r\n\r\nThe ground-floor was occupied by kitchens and another room which the\r\nmerciful man had given up to his horses, leaving his carriage outside in\r\nthe rain and snow. Though not in any way like a stable, the animals were\r\nclearly well-cared-for here. A very steep wooden staircase, certainly\r\n_not_ built for ladies’ high heels, leads to a central room—almost a\r\n“lounge”—which opens into four others. It was dimly lit by candles, a\r\nsurvival from war-days when petrol was worth its weight in\r\ngold—literally two hundred francs a litre.\r\n\r\nFeszi Bey has been in Angora ever since the movement began, and has\r\nacquired that striking expression of a set, firm resolve which I notice\r\non the faces of all his colleagues. I asked him whether he did not\r\n“sometimes tire of living in this bare and rough Asiatic fortress, so\r\nfar from all means of culture or distraction.”\r\n\r\n“We have our work,” he replied; “too absorbing and too important to\r\nleave us time for complaint. We do not even ‘miss’ our comforts, or need\r\nmore than an hour or two’s sleep. There is so much to plan for our new\r\ncountry, the day, and most of the night, are not long enough.”\r\n\r\nHere one naturally feels far more in “New Turkey” than at Smyrna; the\r\nimpression grows on one day by day. At Lausanne I tried to make them\r\nunderstand that they were still busying themselves over a Turkey that is\r\ndead.... “You can’t talk to these people as you were accustomed to speak\r\nunder the Sultans, they would not understand you.”\r\n\r\nThey only smiled at a woman carried away by her emotions. But they were\r\nwrong; this is no question of sex. The very ramparts, clear-cut in the\r\ndistance like gigantic razor-blades, the very remains of the Roman, even\r\nthe Seldjoucide and Osman, civilisations which halted among these hills,\r\nwill bear witness to the birth of a new nation!\r\n\r\nAs I gaze out over the mountain-tomb of Timourlin a voice seems to cut\r\nthrough the chill air: “Here is a glory that will not perish. Here,\r\nwhere the civilisations of the world’s childhood have flourished; here,\r\non the ruins of the great Empire of the Ancients; here beginneth a new\r\nTurkey, the democrat of democracies!”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n          ANGORA II.—AT THE HOME OF MY KIND AND COURTEOUS HOST\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE next morning we breakfast, “when I am ready,” which is 8.30. My\r\nhost’s face beams with delight, and the generous _menu_ could hardly\r\nfail to put “the guest” in good spirits—toast and boiled eggs (my\r\nallowance being half a dozen a day), biscuits and cheese, olives, and\r\nglasses of tea.\r\n\r\nIn Nationalist houses “reading the papers” and discussing foreign\r\ntelegrams have become almost a religious rite. This morning, clearly,\r\nthere is “good news”! The very air we breathe seems lighter, faces look\r\nless anxious, men are greeting each other in hopeful tones! What can it\r\nbe?\r\n\r\nOf course, I am not kept long in suspense—“Mr. Lloyd George is a fallen\r\nangel!” Well, certainly, I shall not go into mourning; but, at the same\r\ntime, the animosity thus so sharply revealed makes one sad for one’s own\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nWith their inborn tact, my friends suggest that we all go to the Pasha’s\r\nto celebrate, _not_ the fall of a “Lost Leader,” but the prospect of the\r\nConservatives’ return to power.\r\n\r\nTo them, as in England, the change is welcome for the long vista of\r\npossibilities it opens up. Shall we resume the Beaconsfield traditions\r\nwithout Gladstone’s sentimentality? Will Mr. Bonar Law find means to\r\njustify our faith? It is obviously early days yet for any assurance in\r\nprophecy.\r\n\r\nYet, if the exit of Mr. Lloyd George delighted the Continent and the\r\nNear East—as if a modern Nero had been assassinated—I, for one, could\r\nonly think with sorrow upon the “splendour of opportunity” which he has\r\nmissed and lost. No man, since the world began, ever held in his hands\r\nsuch a power for good in England and among all nations. He could have\r\nraised the prestige of Empire to even greater heights and led the\r\ncouncils for peace.\r\n\r\nAlmost the contrary has come to pass. To-day, certainly, our faith, our\r\ngood word, our justice, and our fair play (without which England is\r\n_not_ England) are almost everywhere subjected to suspicion and\r\ndistrust.\r\n\r\nWhen Turks tell me it is as easy “to buy” one of our officers as those\r\nof other nations, that they have done so over and over again in\r\nConstantinople, I try to say that it cannot be. When my host tells me\r\nthey paid £6,000 sterling for our men’s assistance to charter a boat and\r\nescape from Malta, I can only admit, in silence, that they\r\ndid—somehow—escape. When I learn that at least _one_ correspondent in\r\nConstantinople is subsidised by the Greeks, I can bear no more. Whence\r\nhave bribery and corruption invaded our country against the traditions\r\nof centuries? I told them I used to feel that “I was sitting on a rock\r\namidst howling and roaring seas; now even the rock itself is sinking.”\r\n\r\nTo pay honour where honour is due, I compliment the Minister on the\r\nsplendid “foreign” news of both his papers—the _Tanine_ and the _Vakit_.\r\nI wish to-day that I knew the language and could read the articles by\r\nHussein Djahid and Ahmet Emine. Even translated, I find them full of\r\nsound commonsense and beautifully written. If at times they are bitter,\r\nthere is none of that sensationalism which our Press has lately borrowed\r\nfrom the States.\r\n\r\nMy host is due at his office at 9.30, but, though he has ventured to\r\nglance at his watch, the talk continues. At about 10.30, I casually ask:\r\n“Are you not going to your office to-day?”\r\n\r\n“When you allow it,” was the startling answer.\r\n\r\nNow, surely, time is of importance at least to a responsible Minister?\r\nYet he will cheerfully give up an hour of his sleep (for that is what it\r\nwill mean) to my entertainment, because I have forgotten _my_ duty.\r\n\r\n“Do not hesitate,” he went on, “to tell me of anyone you would specially\r\nlike to meet, man or woman. It shall be arranged.... Fethi Bey will\r\nlunch with you to-day. Whom else shall I invite?”\r\n\r\nI said that I should, one day, like to see Younous Nadi Bey, the editor\r\nof _Yeni Gun_ and President of Commission for Foreign Affairs in the\r\nGrand National Assembly. “He must be interesting, since our Press\r\ndescribe him as a ‘man who ought to be shot’!”\r\n\r\nI found this gentleman, as I expected, well worth going out of one’s way\r\nto meet. Without the exquisite manners of Hussein Djahid Bey, he is one\r\nof those men who, having made up his own mind about right and wrong,\r\nnever hesitates to act.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, until he _is_ shot, he will not allow the Government to\r\nsleep, nor to trust Europe without sufficient guarantees. He graciously\r\nwrote in _Yeni Gun_ that I had given him some very valuable information\r\nabout our policy. I certainly did my best to explain Lord Curzon’s\r\nposition. Neither he nor Fethi Bey, however, could understand how he\r\ncould stay in the new Cabinet. I scarcely expected that they, or any\r\nforeigner, could realise the full measure of England’s folly in putting\r\nthe whole machinery of government into one man’s undisputed control.\r\nLike everyone else nominally in power, the Foreign Minister became a\r\nmere cypher.\r\n\r\n“Why did he stand it?” they asked.\r\n\r\n“For the moment, no protests would have had any effect. His resignation\r\nmight easily have brought in a far more complete collapse, and,\r\nmeanwhile, he probably felt that the interests of Conservatism were, to\r\na large extent, in his hands. Lord Curzon knows the East, and he knows\r\nwhat _ought_ to be done. As Goethe says: ‘Between the knave and the\r\nfool, one should always choose the knave.’... _Gegen die Dumheit,\r\nkämpfen die Götte selbst vergebens._ (Even the gods fight in vain\r\nagainst stupidity.)”\r\n\r\nAgain and again I try to assure them that our policy in Turkey is going\r\nto “come right.” When they politely retorted that we “did not seem in\r\nany great hurry to start turning,” I could only suggest that “Empires,\r\nlike whales, could not quickly change their direction.”\r\n\r\nYounous Nadi Bey is a most interesting talker. Like so many of the\r\nNationalists, he “comes from” Malta; like them all, he loves his country\r\nsincerely, and is eager to protect her. Can we expect these men to trust\r\nthe Power that, only three months ago, was doing its best to destroy\r\nthem? For myself, I could only hope that we should soon give them sound\r\nreason to change their opinions.\r\n\r\nI afterwards paid a visit to Younous Nadi at the offices of the _Yeni\r\nGun_. After coffee in his primitive “editorial sanctum,” I was shown\r\nover all the “works.”\r\n\r\nThe illustrations are prepared with a hand machine, which reminded me of\r\nour school magazine activities; but the “results” are, if anything,\r\nrather better than our own “dailies” achieve.\r\n\r\nThe operator had built his bed over the solitary press, in part, no\r\ndoubt, to save time, but possibly also with the idea of protecting his\r\n“treasure.” The editor apologised for the lack of all our modern\r\nprocesses of production. I was the more inclined to compliment him upon\r\nhis conquest of difficulties.\r\n\r\nIt is surely a _tour de force_ to “get the news” from this Anatolian\r\nmachinery, and there are sixty papers in Anatolia!\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe were staying in the Hadji Baïram quarter of Angora, so called from\r\nthe mosque and turbé erected in memory of that sainted man. My host’s\r\nhouse stands on the edge of a hillock, exposed on all sides to the rain\r\nor wind or snow. No carriage can drive up to the doors, and, too often,\r\nthat last hundred yards’ walk means being soaked to the skin. Any number\r\nof stray dogs and cats find shelter in its many doorways, howling and\r\nwhining all through the night.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GRAND NATIONAL ASSEMBLY AT ANGORA.\r\n  p. 141\r\n]\r\n\r\nMy guide is supposed to call for me at ten o’clock in the morning, but I\r\nhave often enough rejoiced at his indifference to the clock. There is so\r\nmuch to sketch from our front door: an unused cemetery, with\r\nmoss-covered stèles (tombstones) lying in picturesque confusion; a\r\ntumble-down shepherd’s hut; a crumbling mosque; mud houses in need of\r\nrepair; and for background, a steep hill crowned by Timourlin’s tomb.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  “There is so much to sketch from our front door.”\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhile painting, I have counted just four passers-by—two men leading\r\ntheir fruit-laden donkeys, and two women taking their asses to drink. No\r\nartist can resist Oriental landscapes; and genius, I suppose, would\r\nhardly remember to share my longing for nice warm “Western” baths in an\r\natmosphere that means “microbes” in summer and in winter all kinds of\r\ndiscomfort.\r\n\r\nThe “sights” for tourists do not delay one many days. There are\r\nexcellent “Red Cross” hospitals, a military hospital, an école normale\r\nfor girls, a military school, the Ministries, town gardens, the Armenian\r\nOrphanage, the “Embassies,” and the Ottoman Bank. One can also enjoy\r\nlong drives through miles of uncultivated land.\r\n\r\nThese various “institutions,” particularly the educational, are full of\r\ninterest if one had time to thoroughly investigate the whole system,\r\nsince probably no civilisation in the world differs so radically from\r\nour own.\r\n\r\nExplorations, however extensive, must all be over before five o’clock.\r\nFor as the eastern sun sets in its glory, we all go home—ministers and\r\ndeputies to plan and work, the rest of the population to talk and wonder\r\nwhat the “great folk” are doing.\r\n\r\nI never understood how all the people managed to hide themselves in so\r\nfew houses. Turks, we all know, can perform miracles with mattresses and\r\ndivans; but even their ingenuity can seldom have overcome so “tough a\r\nproblem” as the inhabitants, official and civil, of Angora.\r\n\r\nThere _is_, admittedly, a housing “problem,” and building has not yet\r\nbegun. As Angora is to be the permanent seat of Government, they cannot\r\nmuch longer delay the important consideration of providing for Foreign\r\nEmbassies.\r\n\r\nI have already driven many times past the Assembly (which closely\r\nresembles one of our county clubs); I have seen the admirably-arranged\r\nflower-gardens and heard the band. To-morrow, for the first time, I am\r\nto _enter_ the Nationalist Parliament!\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n         ANGORA III.—THE MARVELLOUS ATMOSPHERE OF A GREAT BIRTH\r\n\r\n\r\nIN all my wanderings, East and West, over Europe and America, I have\r\nnowhere been so much thrilled by a dominating sense of “real effort” as\r\nat Angora. Against a background of prehistoric civilisations, the human\r\nbees swarm in and out of their Parliament, buzzing away night and day, a\r\n_free and independent Turkey_.\r\n\r\nWhat will their “delegation” accomplish at Lausanne? Is the war only\r\npostponed, or will there be peace? “At one moment our spirits rise to\r\nthe most daring hopes; we see ourselves marching into Constantinople. At\r\nthe next, Younous Nadi Bey reports ‘grave news’ from abroad, and\r\npreparations for war are resumed.”\r\n\r\nThe colonel persists in “doubt” towards England. “Do you know,” said I,\r\n“I am astonished at my own superiority?”\r\n\r\nHe was not convinced, but demanded chapter and verse.\r\n\r\n“We both love Turkey; but I also love your country and you dislike mine.\r\nTherefore, am I not immensely your superior?”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a sense, no doubt, we exaggerate things away here in Angora. If\r\nEurope could ever realise what “a free and independent Turkey” really\r\nmeans to her own people, the miracle would still seem no more than one\r\ntiny step forward in the interests of the world. Yet sometimes I wonder\r\nover the words of Cardinal Gasparri: “Turkey has not only dictated to\r\nEngland, but to France and Italy as well.”\r\n\r\nAnd now, here in Angora, I see them coming along their one wide road.\r\nAll mingled without a thought of social distinctions; all intent upon\r\nthe same goal—their country’s freedom; all alike proud of the price they\r\nhave paid—officers and deputies, ministers and civil servants, soldiers,\r\npeasants, and caravan-drivers. Are not these, then, the one true\r\ndemocracy of the world?\r\n\r\n“If I resent being called American,” I told my friends here, “it\r\ncertainly is _not_ because I dislike democracy. In Western practice,\r\nalas, it has been like ‘freedom for women’—so imperfectly carried out.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom its original bungalow design, the building of the Grand Nationalist\r\nAssembly still retains a certain resemblance to the club-pavilion. But\r\nconsiderable extensions are being put forward as rapidly as a climate\r\nthat only varies from ten to fifteen degrees below zero will permit;\r\nwhile its commanding position, and the care bestowed upon the entrance\r\nand grounds, are admirably calculated to uphold the honour and dignity\r\nof the Nationalist flag overhead.\r\n\r\nThere is a large ante-room on the left as you enter, where I generally\r\nspent a good part of the day, after my first visit to the Assembly,\r\noccasionally finding my way into the actual Debate. There were always\r\ncoffee and cigarettes in the ante-room; and it was there I met\r\npractically all the ministers and deputies, who must, at last, have\r\ngrown weary of my endless questions on every conceivable aspect of their\r\nideals and their activities. “You must accept me,” I said, in\r\nhalf-serious apology, “as a self-constituted Father Confessor” to the\r\nnew nation he loves and admires so much.\r\n\r\nAcross the corridor, too, I was allowed sometimes to say “good\r\nafternoon” over a cup of coffee to “the Pasha” (as M. Kemal is here\r\nknown to all) in his Presidential Bureau.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I believe the men “understood” all my questions, however\r\nindiscreet, and did not take offence. They seemed so eager for me to\r\nmeet _everyone_ and learn _everything_.\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, a very pleasant and most human pursuit of knowledge—a\r\ncontinual succession of brilliant and zealous men, interpreting\r\nthemselves and their dreams to an eager listener.\r\n\r\nAmong other matters, I was particularly anxious to know whether\r\nConstantinople or Angora was to be the _permanent_ capital of the new\r\nState, and to understand all the reasons that would determine their\r\nchoice.\r\n\r\nI love every inch of Constantinople. There are obvious and important\r\nreligious-historical associations with its mosques and its public\r\nbuildings; comfort and dignity, space and beauty, are, as it were,\r\nalready at hand. Yet, paradoxical as it may seem, to me it lacks, and\r\nwill always lack, the marvellous atmosphere of a Great Birth that so\r\nimpresses one in Angora.\r\n\r\nThe Turks, I found, were unanimous in having a similar preference and,\r\nnaturally, put forward more precise and practical reasons for their\r\nchoice. There may be occasion for a _temporary_ sojourn in\r\nConstantinople.\r\n\r\n_But_ they want an “Asiatic” capital; they want to govern their own\r\ncountry beyond the reach of possible interference from dreadnoughts;\r\nthey want to maintain an intimate continuity of association with the\r\ncradle of the movement that begot the State.\r\n\r\nThere is, moreover, a primitive and Asiatic charm in Angora, which\r\nshould serve, as it were, to “keep them holy” from the materialisms and\r\nthe intrigues of Western commerce-Empires.\r\n\r\nHere we are all brothers, fellow-labourers in a common cause. All have\r\nsuffered—at Malta, in Egypt, or from corrupt Ottoman Imperial\r\nGovernment. Could such union and natural intimacy exist elsewhere?\r\n\r\nThe “Brotherhood” of the East does not mean anything like our various\r\nforms of socialism. The “democracy” or almost complete ignoring of class\r\ndistinctions, does not destroy, or even modify, the inherited respectful\r\nsubmission of illiterate peasants to their “superiors” in intellect,\r\nauthority, or military power. Their religion teaches them to obey.\r\n\r\nIt _does_ mean a universal recognition of identity of interest; that the\r\n“good of all” is every man’s good and every man’s responsibility; that\r\nall have _equal_ rights to know what can be done for them by the State,\r\nto give their opinions, to express their wishes or their complaints, and\r\nto be heard with courteous attention. You feel that literally the whole\r\nnation is being busy about its welfare and its hopes.\r\n\r\nWith us, of course, the submerged proletariat could not practise (and\r\nwould not be _allowed_ to practise) such _real_ equality without\r\nperpetual self-assertion and loud outcries against the “slavery” of the\r\npast.\r\n\r\nEvery Turk, in his degree, has always been content with so little. His\r\npersonal nature is uncomplaining, from a combination of fine feeling and\r\nwhat in us would mean lack of courage. Herein lies at once their great\r\nweakness and their great strength.\r\n\r\nEven the “new,” _soi-disant_ “arrogant” Turk does not complain. He may\r\nintend to, he may assure us that he will. Western friends, no doubt, are\r\noften tempted to wish him the master of a little more push and noise.\r\nLonger intimacy and a more sympathetic understanding, however, will cure\r\nus of this mistake. Were he not so supersensitive all the time, did he\r\nattempt our rush methods of progress, he would soon cease to be himself\r\nand lose the fine mystic idealism for which no sacrifice has been too\r\ngreat, no passion of waiting and working too prolonged.\r\n\r\nThey will not yet set up a Republic, as we understand the word. No\r\nnation on earth has less capacity or inclination for Bolshevism. There\r\ncould never be any common chord between their faith and the principles\r\nof Lenin and Trotsky. One hears so much of the Red influence behind\r\nNationalist demands that it is well to meet these men in their own\r\nhouses (truly “in labour” for a Nation’s birth) to see and know that\r\nsuch accusations are absolutely false. Soviet Russia has been a “friend\r\nin need” to the Turks, and may befriend them again; but—_nothing more_.\r\n\r\nThe overpowering magnificence of the Bolshevik Embassy may be a measure\r\nof their designs, but carries no proof of achievement. When personages\r\nlike Fethi Bey and Rauf Bey are working in tiny offices no better than\r\nglorified barns, one does not, of course, like to see the Soviets in\r\npossession of the only large and well-appointed building in the town.\r\nThere is a staff of seventy, including an army of typists. The attachés\r\nare well supplied with cars, carriages, and other Western luxuries,\r\npaying their bills with gold Russian roubles.\r\n\r\nThey are allowed to distribute Red literature, though no one in Turkey\r\nthinks of reading it. When the Russians once sent a few Turks to Angora\r\nto preach Bolshevism, they were promptly shot by the Nationalist\r\nGovernment, _pour encourager les autres_! That was the end of Bolshevist\r\npropaganda!\r\n\r\nI asked one of the deputies what Turkey thought she had gained from the\r\nBolshevists. “When any foreign representative visits a country as\r\nfriendless as Turkey,” he replied, “and says: ‘We thoroughly approve of\r\nall your ideas and principles; we want to show the world that we believe\r\nin the doctrines of freedom and independence that you are preaching,’\r\nshould we turn away from the only sympathy we received?\r\n\r\n“Besides, we had many frontiers to defend; at least by shaking hands\r\nwith the Soviet we secured _one_ frontier. I know that this simple act\r\nof grateful friendship has been much discussed and severely criticised\r\nin Europe. It may have done us great harm; but beggars cannot be\r\nchoosers. Who else stretched out a hand of friendship?”\r\n\r\n“And gold and arms?” I inquired. “Forgive my indiscretion.”\r\n\r\n“A very little gold,” he replied, “not a penny more than two million\r\nTurkish pounds. We had arms from all nations, no more from Russia than\r\nfrom Czecho-Slovakia. It will surprise you to know that most of them\r\nwere bought from England and Greece.”\r\n\r\n“But where could you get the money?” I next inquired.\r\n\r\n“From our Anatolian population. In no other country, would the people\r\nhave accepted such heavy taxation upon their lands, their cattle, and\r\ntheir corn. No other country has been driven to resist the whole world\r\nin defence of her very existence. Our taxes must have reached 75 per\r\ncent. So you see that if Europe does not care to help us, we can manage\r\nfor ourselves, and waste no tears over her in difference.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCertain European papers have published a report that Camerad Areloff has\r\nbeen admitted to the Cabinet Councils of New Turkey. When an Ambassador\r\nfrom Angora was asked why her Government did not contradict the obvious\r\nfalsehood, he retorted: “If any paper, in any country, announced that\r\nyour British Ambassador was taking part in the Councils of the French\r\nCabinet, would your Government protest?” It was readily acknowledged\r\nthat we should consider such a statement to be entirely beneath our\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\n“Of course you would,” said the Turk; “and we take precisely the same\r\nview.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived at the Assembly one afternoon the band was playing in the\r\ngardens—a strange accompaniment, I thought, to the serious business of\r\nParliament. I asked one of the deputies whether this was a national\r\nholiday, or a day of thanksgiving for the arrival of the ex-Khalif at\r\nMalta? It was lucky for me that the rather dangerous little joke only\r\nraised a smile, while he explained that, as the Imperial Band had fled\r\nfrom Constantinople with the Nationalists, its loyalty must be\r\nacknowledged and its services utilised. It did, in fact, play here for a\r\nshort time every day. Now I remembered that I had heard bands also in\r\nSmyrna and Constantinople.\r\n\r\nIt was graciously suggested that I should choose something myself for\r\nthe band to play, and I asked that we might have some Turkish music. One\r\nof the deputies, it appeared, had written an opera; and after listening\r\nwith great pleasure to some selections from his work, I was introduced\r\nto the composer. The opera, naturally written round the cause, is full\r\nof a pathos that brings tears to the eyes of an understanding audience.\r\nThey also gave me a patriotic love song—the reunion of two lovers\r\n(Anatolia and Roumelia) after long years of separation—which I should\r\nlike to have heard again and brought away with me. Its beauty was\r\nhaunting, though not quite easy to follow at a first hearing.\r\n\r\nFor Roumelia, we know, her share in the horrors of war is over. Now it\r\nis Anatolia who must suffer. Trouble was even fomented among the tribes.\r\nFirst, the rebellion of the Roums, who were encouraged to stand for\r\nprivate independence; then the hostility of the Alewites, and the\r\nrebellion of Armenians in Cilicia; finally a rising of Circassian\r\ntribes—Durdje, Khandeke, Adabazar. Naturally again, the men to whom\r\nAbdul Medjid had given the villayet of Sivas, after the horrible\r\nmassacres of 1864, were loyal to the Khalif’s successor and furious at\r\nany idea of Nationalist interference.\r\n\r\nThe course of true love between these two nations had not run smoothly.\r\nNo wonder their reunion should be celebrated with such appealing\r\nremorse!\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe President of the Assembly, Mustapha Kemal Pasha, was talking to me\r\none day of the French Revolution, and compared what he called his own\r\n“very elegant” beginning with the poor little Assembly in which Michelet\r\nhad to work, with its single table and just a couple of chairs!\r\n\r\nHere, in addition to the large ante-room and M. Kemal’s bureau, the\r\nVice-President, Adnan Bey, husband of Halidé Edib Hanoum—has his bureau;\r\nand the actual Assembly Hall (built for concerts) is a fine room, with\r\nits Strangers’ and Press Galleries, its platform, and Speaker’s desk.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker (in this case the Vice-President) appeared to me to be\r\nringing his bell for order all the time; but the whole scene recalls the\r\nFrench Chamber of Deputies, and here, too, they all talk at once and\r\ninterrupt each other without ceremony.\r\n\r\nWhen I mentioned to “the Pasha” how strange it seemed to me that a\r\nParliament should be so noisy, Fethi Bey explained by describing to his\r\nchief the dignity of our proceedings at Westminster.[1] He proved, once\r\nmore, to be a keen observer, quick to decide and act, though a man of\r\nfew words. His cold reception in London did not diminish his keen\r\ninterest in our civilisation, which appeals to him immensely, and which\r\nhe was always ready to praise. He told me he wanted to go back to\r\nEngland, this time incognito, and really master all the institutions,\r\nactivities, and policies of the country, in order to explain us to his\r\nown people.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  Fortunately he saw us on our best behaviour at Westminster.\r\n\r\nI only wish that he could make time for such a mission. The interfering\r\npropaganda of Europe has made Turkish nationalism very touchy. One\r\ncertainly cannot blame them for any suspicion or readiness to take\r\noffence, nor wonder at the reception they might accord to offers of help\r\nfrom even the best foreign specialists whom they had not themselves\r\nelected to invite or consult. The fight for freedom has been\r\nsingle-handed, and the price too heavy for them to endure a thought of\r\ntaking the slightest risk.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI noticed one more evidence of Democracy in this Hall of Assembly. There\r\nis absolutely no formal division, either by rank or office, in the\r\nseating accommodation. The deputies sit anywhere, each at a sort of\r\nschool-desk, and when the President comes in to hear a debate, he simply\r\nlooks round for the first vacant seat.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a tribune for speeches in front of the Speaker’s\r\ntable, from which I enjoyed much fluent and animated oratory. The Turks\r\nspeak mostly without notes and their constant gestures recall the\r\nFrench. Others, however, no doubt partly from my not knowing the\r\nlanguage, produced a similar impression to that of prayers in a Jewish\r\nsynagogue.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly is never closed, each member, however, being entitled to\r\nthree months’ holiday. At this time about two hundred were in attendance\r\nand crowded the hall to overflowing. The total membership is three\r\nhundred and forty.\r\n\r\nI am not allowed to forget that it was England who really created the\r\nNationalist Assembly—May 16, 1920, is the historic date—when we took\r\npossession of the Turkish Parliament in Constantinople, and the patriots\r\n(a hundred and fifty of the most enlightened Turks) were imprisoned at\r\nMalta. Then it was that Nationalism demanded, and set up, its own\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\nMen from Malta and the other deputies who escaped from Constantinople\r\nform two-thirds of the present Parliament; the remaining third have been\r\nelected in the country itself.\r\n\r\nIts composition is, indeed, unique, representing all sorts and\r\nconditions of men, as varied in age, social position, and dress as they\r\nare in ideas.\r\n\r\nAs I looked down from the gallery on this strange, eager group, my eye\r\nwas caught by the picturesque figure of that “ancient of days,” the\r\nDeputy for Dersim. Diab is a Kurd, ninety years old, who speaks Turkish\r\nwith difficulty. A tall, erect old man, with a long white beard and\r\nlarge piercing blue eyes that need no aid from glasses; he wears the\r\ntribal head-dress and robes, carrying an amber chaplet. Though the only\r\ndeputy who can neither read nor write, he is a great personage in his\r\nown country, the chief of an important tribe. As, however, he has only\r\ntwice spoken in the Assembly, we may suppose that the mountain\r\npopulation are generally able to settle their own grievances outside\r\nAngora. He tells me that, like most of his constituents, he lives almost\r\nentirely upon goats’ milk and bread, and that, as many of them have\r\nreached their hundred and twentieth year, he himself is reckoned a young\r\nman!\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, however, it is the Dancing Dervishes who have sent up\r\none of the most progressive spirits to the Assembly. The “Grand\r\nTchelebi,” too, is a picturesque figure in his long brown cylinder felt\r\nhat and ecclesiastical robes. Descended from an even older family than\r\nOsman’s, he yet voted with the Hodjas for the dethronement of the\r\nex-Khalif.\r\n\r\nThe hostility of many deputies towards the Hodjas is rather puzzling;\r\nbut the journalist who said, “These men cannot think as we think,” may\r\nbe right. He added: “Every big nation except the English has recognised\r\nthe wisdom of separating Church and State. Yet when we advocate the same\r\npolicy we are severely censured.” It is also stated that the Hodjas\r\nthemselves cannot keep pace with the most progressive among the leaders,\r\nand are, therefore, quite willing to stand outside the Councils of the\r\nState. The Assembly no doubt would not suffer any religious element to\r\nhamper progress or interfere with its newly acquired freedom and\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nThe predominance of military uniforms will strike any Western observer;\r\nbut one should remember the country is still at war. A few still wear\r\nthe fez; but the very great majority have adopted the more picturesque\r\nkalpak, that varies in colour from grey and brown to black, and must be\r\ncomfortable and warm in winter.\r\n\r\nThere are, naturally, many of the special difficulties in this Assembly\r\nthat are inseparable from all beginnings of progress, in a country with\r\nno experience of self-government. The more illiterate deputies, for\r\nexample, know nothing of Europe, and regard everything Western with\r\nbitter hostility and distrust. On the other hand, I met one day a\r\nbrilliant Socialist munition-worker who, having studied Karl Marx and\r\nArthur Henderson, wants to establish a precise replica of English trade\r\nunionism in Turkey—which God forbid!\r\n\r\nThere are some simple farm labourers, shopkeepers, lawyers, doctors who\r\nhave studied in Paris, newspaper editors, University professors, and\r\nValis.\r\n\r\nThe most enlightened speak practically every language in Europe, and are\r\nthoroughly well acquainted with public life on the Continent. They stand\r\nfor the Freedom of Women, and did their best to make Halidé Hanoum a\r\nmember of the Assembly. They would be perfectly at home in our most\r\nexclusive drawing-rooms; yet they work well, in the Cabinet itself, with\r\nmen absolutely ignorant of any country except their own. “Social, or\r\nclass, differences,” I am told, “have no place in any Parliament. They\r\nare created by Society women outside!”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the Conference at Lausanne, the papers published a scandalous\r\nstatement that “a deputy could purchase a seat in the Assembly for ten\r\ngold Turkish pounds!” As a matter of fact, all Turkish elections are\r\nvery carefully controlled by inspectors and the municipal authorities.\r\nNo one who knows anything of M. Kemal and his colleagues would dream of\r\nimagining that this form of bribery or purchase could be allowed.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSmarting under the policy of Malta (not unlike that of Daudet’s hero,\r\nwho locked his goat in a room but forgot to close the window), the Grand\r\n“_National_” Assembly lives up to its name, and is, above all,\r\nanti-everything that could interfere with real freedom. For three and a\r\nhalf years of untold hardship and self-sacrifice the gospel of\r\nNationalism has schooled the people. It is their religion to-day, from\r\nthe “Pasha” himself to the humblest shepherd of the hills.\r\n\r\nAt Angora we read the papers and talk politics all day; at night we\r\ndream of the National Pact. Everyone watches for foreign telegrams; we\r\nall attend the Assembly; the statesmen work without ceasing through the\r\ntwenty-four hours. The genius of M. Kemal as military chief and civil\r\norganiser is unequalled.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, do the nations doubt? Turks to-day are fully determined to\r\nrun their own country; they will find the necessary ability and will\r\nsuffer no interference. Europe has so far condemned them unheard and\r\nrefused them a square deal. We must change all that and see to it that\r\nthe East may have her chance!\r\n\r\nThe more closely I have studied the National Assembly the greater\r\nconfidence I feel.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n    THE GHAZI MUSTAPHA KEMAL PASHA—THE GREATEST MAN IN TURKEY TO-DAY\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW that I know Angora, I must know also its Nationalist hero.\r\n\r\nFethi Bey has invited me this afternoon to meet the President at the\r\nAssembly. The Lausanne Conference is beginning—perhaps he will give me\r\nhis impressions.\r\n\r\nFrom the window of the antechamber I saw the Pasha arrive, attended only\r\nby one aide-de-camp. There is, of course, absolutely no foundation for\r\nthe stories that he is even more strictly guarded than Lenin, among a\r\npeople who trust and love him!\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to see M. Kemal Pasha to realise that he is the\r\ngreatest man in Turkey to-day, quite apart from his actual achievements.\r\nHe has, indeed, accomplished miracles; but it is rather the universal\r\nattitude of the people by which one measures the man. I feel that my\r\nhost’s regard for me was definitely increased when I had had lunch with\r\nMustapha Kemal. The servants announce the “Pasha, Pasha”—no need for a\r\nmore precise name.\r\n\r\nShould one hold him greater as statesman, soldier, or orator? since he\r\nis past-master in all three aspects. Personally, I am more grateful to\r\nhim who prevents war than to the conqueror. It is as a statesman that I\r\nmet him, and I will therefore first consider his political ideals and\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nGreat events create great men, and it is but once in the life of a\r\nnation that situations so grave as that which found Mustapha Kemal are\r\never likely to arise. He rose out of the terror of the Hamidian régime,\r\nthe years that followed, and the humiliation of _occupied_ Smyrna. It\r\nneeded, however, the suffering and sorrow to which all reformers must\r\nserve their apprenticeship to mould his character and to bring him where\r\nhe now stands. It was the long-suffering martyrdom one saw in the face\r\nof his late mother that forced him to realise what he must do, and he\r\nhas never faltered from the goal.\r\n\r\nOnly here, beside them, can one understand all the Government has had to\r\ndo in Angora, and see for oneself how the whole flock still look to this\r\none man for courage and inspiration. Had _he_ lost faith in the goal or\r\nin his capacity to reach it, all would have been lost. “Freedom for\r\nTurkey or death for the Turks” has been his motto throughout the years.\r\n\r\nI suppose that, however often one may proclaim it, they will not believe\r\nwho have not seen, a new Turkey is born into the world. It is, indeed,\r\nidle to weep over the days that are dead and gone, when the Turk counted\r\nfor nothing in his own land; when the foreigner ruled the roost, and\r\nambassadors were princes! The new Turk has arrived; the member of a new\r\nnation. No important demand was made at Lausanne by Turkey that any\r\nself-respecting people could be asked to forgo.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the Powers are still attempting to treat with “old” Turkey! We\r\nhave no longer to maintain our officious, if well-meant, interference on\r\nbehalf of disloyal minorities; to insist, _par exemple_, that Christians\r\nshall be exempted from military service, as America never exempted her\r\nnegro population.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE GHAZI MUSTAPHA KEMAL PASHA.\r\n  PRESIDENT OF THE GRAND NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, ANGORA.\r\n  (Signed portrait presented to the Author).\r\n  p. 160\r\n]\r\n\r\nNo wonder, again, M. Kemal has been more than tempted to wish (what, for\r\nno other reason, he could desire) to abolish religion altogether, after\r\nthe imposition upon Constantinople of that arch-intriguer the Greek\r\nPatriarch! When France and Italy recognised the “State” Church for the\r\nparasite that may, at any moment, suck up its life-blood, they cast the\r\nChurch aside. Confronted at the very outset by a precisely similar\r\ndanger, Mustapha Kemal at once cut off the Khalifat from the Assembly\r\nand considerably limited the power of the Hodjas, a far more difficult\r\noperation than French disestablishment. Yet we expect him a second time\r\nto expose himself to the intrigues of a Greek Patriarch!\r\n\r\nHe is, as a fact, far more leniently inclined towards the Greeks and\r\nArmenians than any other Turkish statesman. He sees even their wanton\r\ndestruction of Anatolia as no more than the outburst of a misguided\r\npeople, the victims of bigger, intriguing Powers. He would rather\r\nwelcome their return to loyalty than give their place in commerce to the\r\nJews, from the humane conviction that they have no homes outside Turkey.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe home life of Mustapha Kemal, literally given to his country,\r\ninvolves severe daily self-sacrifice. From month to month he allows\r\nhimself no recreation, no change of scene, no intercourse with the\r\nworld’s culture. Among these lonely mountains he cannot break the\r\nmonotony by going to a play or to a concert; he does not hunt or follow\r\nany kind of sport; and even Nature, at least in winter, is scarcely\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nHis life is one of continual mental and physical effort: reading,\r\nstudying, and planning, seeing everyone, for they all want to see “The\r\nPasha” and not the second in command. To me he seems like a professor,\r\nwho must be forever explaining to his people what their Nationalism\r\nreally means. Perhaps the nearest historical parallel to his abounding\r\npersonality is that of Julius Cæsar; and one is tempted to hope that he,\r\ntoo, may find time to leave us the “Commentaries.” The world would know\r\nhow to value what the Turks need put on record, the thought of this keen\r\nand alert mind which is able to interpret, if not supplement, the Koran\r\nfor modern conditions and aspirations. They have, as it were, many\r\ncenturies of progress to catch up; and, fortunately, he is no blind\r\nrespecter of _tyrannical_ religious or historic traditions that hamper\r\nadvance to freedom. A commentary of great value could be compiled from\r\nhis thoughtful and stirring speeches.\r\n\r\nIt may be that, as in art the highest form is simplest, we shall, after\r\nall, see the perfect Democracy in the East. The ideals of President\r\nWilson have been discarded as impossible; Russia has signally failed to\r\ncarry out the teachings of Karl Marx. Mustapha Kemal Pasha, at least,\r\nhas put _his_ doctrine in practice to the acknowledged advantage of a\r\ncountry in the “Slough of Despond.”\r\n\r\nTurkish statesmen maintain to-day that any form of a Second Chamber\r\nremains only the unfit survival of decadent Monarchies and Empires, that\r\nthe Single Chamber is the most perfect machine for Government, avoiding\r\nfriction and delay.\r\n\r\nTime alone can prove!\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt my first interview with “The Pasha” he was wearing a big astrakhan\r\nkalpak, pushed well down over his forehead, and smoking cigarette after\r\ncigarette. Though busy receiving ministers and deputies in the\r\nPresidential Bureau, he was at the same time waiting, as it were, for\r\nthe right moment to sum up the whole situation in one final and decisive\r\nreply that could not fail to end all discussion. This power to drive\r\nright through a subject, to find the way out and take it, is one of the\r\nchief sources of his unique authority.\r\n\r\nHe was ready, however, for a sociable cup of coffee, and immediately\r\nasked for news of England. Fethi Bey reminded him of a few scenes from\r\nlife to which I had introduced him in London, including dinner at a\r\nLadies’ Club. Most women would admire the picturesquely weatherbeaten\r\ntint of the Pasha’s complexion, though the piercing, almost stern,\r\nglance of the eye should remind you that you will do well to say clearly\r\nand quietly what you have to say—and go! Though so businesslike and\r\nenergetic, he has a beautifully modulated voice. His French is\r\nwell-chosen; in Turkish he is an orator. Here, then, are the face and\r\nthe expression of a conqueror, but the voice is the voice of a cultured\r\nman of the world.\r\n\r\nNext morning Mustapha Kemal sent his car (a present from the people of\r\nSmyrna) that I might be driven to his villa at Tchan-Kaya, almost twenty\r\nminutes’ ride from Angora. This is the best road in the district; the\r\nothers are just rows of holes and bumps on which someone has thrown some\r\ncobbles and, incidentally, some houses! Though Tchan-Kaya was given to\r\nhim by the people, he has handed over this property to the army, and\r\nlives there as their guest—surely an unusual, but charming, example of\r\nbrotherly love. I wonder whether the Pasha will do the same in the house\r\nI saw, also presented to him, at Broussa, which an historian and\r\narchitect came over from Constantinople to redecorate.\r\n\r\nFrom Tchan-Kaya one obtains an excellent bird’s-eye view of Angora;\r\nwhether at midday or at sunset, sprinkled with, or buried in, snow,\r\nalways picturesque. We get a few hours of sunshine every morning until\r\nquite late in the year; enough to welcome the beautiful white minarets,\r\nso marked a feature in every Eastern scene, whence the muezzin calls the\r\nfaithful to prayer five times a day. Dotted over the hills of Tchan-Kaya\r\nwe see the Pasha’s special guard—the Lasz—wearing a uniform our ladies\r\nwould be delighted, I think, to copy in velvet or satin. The fashion,\r\nhowever, would only suit those who, like these soldiers from Trébizonde,\r\nare tall, slight, and well-built.\r\n\r\nAt the door one gladly accepts the vociferous greeting of a fine brown\r\nretriever. Then comes the aide-de-camp, Mahmoud Bey, always ready with a\r\ngay smile for his chief’s guests, who leads one straight into the house.\r\n\r\nThe kiosk is large and well-built. In the combination of hall and\r\nante-room a white marble fountain is always playing. One of the two\r\npianos in Angora stands in a corner; these are both, alas, more\r\nornamental than useful, made, one could guess, somewhere about 55 B.C.!\r\nA large desk, some fine plants, and the usual Turkish or Persian rugs\r\ncomplete the furniture. One door leads into the Pasha’s mother’s\r\napartments, the other to his own sitting-room.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  On the wall of Mustapha Kemal Pasha’s study the Sultan Osman, first of\r\n    the House of Osman, looks down on Mustapha Kemal Pasha, who has\r\n    ended the dynasty.\r\n]\r\n\r\nI could scarcely believe that I was speaking to the legislator, as my\r\nhost rose to greet me from his Western red-leather sofa. Without his\r\nkalpak, his fair hair, well brushed back, his close-cropped moustache,\r\nhis well-tailored clothes with the correct crease, would surely carry\r\nhim through a London drawing-room without a guess that he was not\r\nEnglish, or, at any rate, not from the North. Again, his keen sense of\r\nhumour is not common among the Turks, and it was a delight to find how\r\nheartily he joined in the laugh which his delightful stories provoked.\r\n\r\nI am told that the Pasha’s type and colouring are not uncommon in his\r\nnative Roumelia—as ever, the North is fair!\r\n\r\nNoticing some “Napoleon” literature on one of the writing-tables, I\r\nregretted that “I had not thought of bringing a book about the ‘little\r\nCorsican,’ instead of merely offering my congratulations on a\r\nmagnificent victory.”\r\n\r\n“Please never think of such a thing,” he replied. “He interests me as a\r\ngreat general, but——”\r\n\r\n“I understood your interest amounted almost to veneration, or so it is\r\nsaid.”\r\n\r\n“What a strange rumour! I naturally study all the great strategists; but\r\nto compare the Sakharia with Austerlitz is surely no great compliment.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  The Ante-room at Tchan-Kaya.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThough I confess to being considerably startled by this emphatic\r\ndeclaration, it reminded me of a conversation with Monsieur Clemenceau\r\nsome years before the war.\r\n\r\n“He told me,” I said, “that he considered Lord Rosebery’s enthusiastic\r\nadmiration of Napoleon had been almost a blot on his own political\r\ncareer.... ‘Where is the greatness of that vain egoist?’ asked the\r\noutspoken Frenchman. ‘I consider myself a hundred times greater, for\r\nthis simple reason: When Napoleon came down he fell for ever. When I, or\r\nmy country, are down, then I am at my greatest and best.’”\r\n\r\nThough M. Kemal could smile at the Gallic boasting, while honouring the\r\nboaster, his own criticism was more quietly expressed:\r\n\r\n“Napoleon put ambition first. He fought for himself, _not_ for ‘the\r\nCause’—with the inevitable _débâcle_.”\r\n\r\nAs I listen to Mustapha Kemal, taking advantage the while of his\r\ngracious invitation to thaw my frozen toes and hands at the wood fire, I\r\nwonder what a “keen soldier” would not have given to be in my place,\r\nwith the chance of hearing a private lecture from one of the world’s\r\ngreat generals, a man not more than forty.\r\n\r\n“Were you ever in doubt of success?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“No, never,” he replied. “I saw the whole scheme from the first (even\r\nwhen we had no munitions), just as it finally worked out. We delayed—to\r\nsave bloodshed and devastation. Fethi Bey went to London as a last\r\nresource, because we wanted a treaty—in ink, not in blood.”\r\n\r\nIs not that last effort for peace, perhaps, this great man’s finest\r\ngesture to a war-ridden generation? Knowing the glory he could win for\r\nhimself, in the certainty of strength for conquest, he yet made three\r\nseparate attempts to persuade the Powers to enforce a peaceful\r\nretirement upon the Greeks. Preparation is not relaxed; no detail has\r\nbeen forgotten; the peasant armies are ready in Anatolia, wondering why,\r\nsince peace lingers, the Great Chief does not fight!\r\n\r\nOne of his generals told me later: “You cannot judge “The Pasha” until\r\nyou have seen him commanding his army. No man could be more fearless,\r\nmore hard on himself, or kinder to his men. He simply ignores pain,\r\nthough a rib be driven into his lungs; and when he leads them, the\r\nsoldiers know all is well. ‘His star is good,’ they say, and they have\r\nno use for generals in the East for whom the stars are known to predict\r\nill. His mind works rapidly to clear decisions. Above all, he never\r\nloses his head, and his judgment is sound.”\r\n\r\nWithout this universal, unstinting affection and esteem from both\r\nofficers and men, Mustapha Kemal could never have established the\r\nAssembly and created a new Turkey. When he had thus realised the vision\r\nof his ardent youth, that never left him through years of exile, revolt,\r\nand disgrace; when, at any moment now, he could declare himself\r\nDictator, he will not steal responsibility from the people’s\r\nrepresentatives. “The Assembly,” he says, “is not one man; I am only its\r\nPresident.”\r\n\r\nHe dislikes hearing the word “Kemalist.” “It does not carry with it the\r\nspirit of the movement, which will go on, whether I am dead or alive.”\r\n\r\nIf one speaks to him about his own work, he either answers: “I did my\r\nduty,” or refers all honour to the Assembly.\r\n\r\nI have talked with many of Europe’s great statesmen, but found none more\r\nmodest than he. Yet who among them has snatched such triumph from odds\r\nas opposing?\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe furniture of this little room is, of course, all “native.” The\r\ndinner-service comes from Kutahia, the carpets and rugs are Anatolian.\r\nOn the walls hang jewelled swords and other trophies or souvenirs, sent\r\nin homage from Moslem rulers to the conqueror they all acknowledge. He\r\nmay endeavour to efface himself, to glory in his simplicity and set up a\r\nreal democracy; but the stamp of his personality is on the whole Moslem\r\nworld; he holds in his hand the keys of Islam. Nationalism has now\r\nacquired a deep religious significance; the Pact is a “decalogue” none\r\nmay deny.\r\n\r\nA well-known Turkish writer has boldly compared the movement with\r\nChristianity; humbly born, bringing suffering to all, death and\r\nmartyrdom to many—for an Ideal of the Spirit no human enemy can crush.\r\n\r\nWho touches Turkey, with Right behind her, will set all Islam on fire to\r\nput down Might.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Mustapha Kemal Pasha’s Sitting-room.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn Egypt they speak of “Holy Angora,” and, wherever future assemblies\r\nmay meet, she will be always sacred. An Egyptian princess, I notice,\r\nuses capitals when referring to the Ghazi Pasha as “He” or “Him.” If\r\nonly the delegates at Lausanne could have managed to peep behind the\r\nscenes at Angora! If they still considered the Nationalist demands\r\nunreasonable, they could scarcely have failed to pause before the\r\ndeep-rooted fanaticism they have inspired.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Pasha is nothing if not frank. He has no time for bluff, though his\r\npride was stung by the idle boasting of our ex-Premier: “You’ve got to\r\nspeak to these people with guns.”\r\n\r\nNo charge could be more ridiculous or untrue than to say that Mustapha\r\nKemal is ever influenced by Camerad Areloff. Bolshevism and Nationalism\r\nare poles apart. Yet the Pasha could scarcely refuse invitations to\r\nconversation with any credited representative from a country like\r\nRussia; though no words of his are likely to change M. Kemal’s\r\ninvariable habit of using his _own_ judgment and making up his _own_\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nThough he seldom speaks without a practical purpose, I was honoured by\r\nan intimacy that nearly approached that of an old school friend. There\r\nwere changes, however, to rather puzzling reserve, almost frigid\r\npoliteness, in his case probably not caused by any reminder of my\r\nnationality. He knows not only whom, but when, to trust, and I suppose I\r\nhad unwittingly opened some dangerous topic.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne almost wishes at times that he need not live so perpetually in the\r\nheat of the fray. Driven, perhaps, by greater intelligence or stricter\r\nintegrity, to some unpopular action, he might lose his halo, or at least\r\ndim its lustre, while the new country was still too unstable for any\r\nweakening of his guiding hand. There are fanatical members of the\r\nAssembly who, _bien entendu_, are far more extreme than he, whose\r\nunchecked counsels might spell disaster. I sought, indeed, for the\r\nopposition within of which we have heard so much, and found only a very\r\nsmall group of rather small-minded men, at present with little power.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, foolish measures, that might prove a real menace, and were\r\ncertainly false to true freedom, have been put forward and discussed.\r\nThe schemes for excluding Albanians and Arabs from the Assembly, and for\r\nrequiring five years’ residence in one place, hit “The Pasha” himself.\r\nTelegrams of angry protest came in from all quarters, and he soon\r\nstopped the mischief. Others, however, may prove more difficult. The\r\nopposition seem to me seeking in Nationalism—“_midi à 14 heures_,” as\r\nthe French say.\r\n\r\nAt present he is not only adored by those who trust him and gave up all\r\nto follow him, but respected and admired by those recently serving the\r\nSultan, who had not the courage to believe that right must triumph and\r\ntruth prevail.\r\n\r\nI believe that his personality could always dominate the Assembly at\r\nAngora, and there is unquestionably no possible foundation for the\r\nreported rivalry of Kiazim Kara Békir. They are the best of friends,\r\neach conspicuously loyal to the other, and Kiazim Kara Békir is far too\r\nproud of his leader to want his place.\r\n\r\nI foresee, however, that even his clearest instructions may sometimes be\r\nbadly interpreted, and thus bring blame for what he has not done and\r\nnever intended. There will be difficulties again in certain foreign\r\nrelations, because the most loyal Nationalists, for whom justice and\r\ngratitude alike demand reward, will not all be so well fitted as the\r\nexisting diplomats for the embassies of Europe.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThough no one could have suspected it from his manner, I learnt that my\r\nAngora host had been seriously alarmed at the prospect of receiving an\r\nEnglishwoman into his household. His first impressions, however, were\r\nunexpectedly in my favour. And the ladies agreed: “You are just like our\r\nPasha—fair hair and blue eyes. You might be his sister.” It was the\r\nhighest possible compliment, the best possible passport.\r\n\r\nMustapha Kemal found time to be no less hospitable, and often treated me\r\nto a concert of Anatolian songs with the oute (or stringed guitar)\r\naccompaniment. It was at his house I first tasted the most delicious of\r\nTurkish confections, “_poulet à la Circassienne_,” that is chicken with\r\nnut sauce. It was frequently offered to me after that; but, alas, like\r\nall things Turkish, even their “light” pastry _Bereks_, it is as\r\nfattening as it is appetising.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon “the Pasha” joined us to pay visits to the houses\r\nsurrounding his kiosk. We made a strange party: the Ghazi Pasha and his\r\naide-de-camp, the Englishwoman, and a big white ram! The magnificent\r\ngoats of Anatolia follow one about and welcome caresses such as we\r\nlavish on a pet dog. The Armenians weave handsome shawls from their\r\nsilky hair. Angora is also famous for its cats and its rabbits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Mustapha Kemal Pasha Walking in the Grounds of Tchan-Kaya.\r\n]\r\n\r\nNaturally, the “veiled” tenants stood in too great awe of their Pasha to\r\nsay much, so we first walked on to inspect the new family of a favourite\r\ndog, then visited another happy family of geese and chickens and the\r\nhorses! Like many Orientals, M. Kemal is over-merciful to his beasts,\r\nwho are apt to grow fat and lazy from insufficient exercise.\r\n\r\nMustapha Kemal always says, and means, that everyone has a right to come\r\nand see him. He enjoys talking with peasants, and pays a generous\r\ntribute to their sterling worth. But in Turkey, some mysterious inborn\r\ntact prevents the uncultured from awkward attempts at intrusion upon his\r\nsuperior, however brotherly the hand of friendship between them. It is,\r\nhowever, almost impossible to compare the two countries, for, despite\r\nthe Moslem’s respect for authority in every shape or form, rank and\r\nfamily do _not_ count with him as with us, and the feudal habits, of\r\nwhich no so-called democracy can cure us, must appear strange indeed to\r\nthese simple folk.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have been privileged to hear “the Pasha” explaining the new Turkey he\r\nhas created, expressing all his ideas, hopes, fears and anxieties; and\r\nthis, at what is perhaps the very summit of his career, when his nation\r\nhas just entered upon her existence of freedom and independence.\r\n\r\nYet I hesitate before the attempt to analyse or to describe the\r\ncharacter and political achievement of this man; to convey all the\r\nsubtlety and the strength of his mind. The complexities, and the\r\napparent contradictions, of the Oriental are always baffling to the\r\nWest; while, though far superior to vanity, the Pasha knows his own\r\nvalue and takes himself, as it were, too much for granted, to encourage\r\nor assist others in the dissection of his character. I can but rest on\r\nthe tolerance all great men extend to our judgments, if prompted by\r\nsincerity and justice and a love of truth. As it is written in the\r\nproverbs of old Japan: “If your judgments are tempered by the dictates\r\nof truth, the gods will protect you, even though you offer no prayers to\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe are naturally enthusiastic before a New Turkey, built out of nothing.\r\nSurely these people are capable of carrying on? If some ask: “Will this\r\nman lose his head?” we answer: “He has not done so under the strongest\r\ntemptation. Why should we fear?... He has not made himself Dictator; he\r\nhas refused wealth and honour; he has abolished ‘decorations!’”\r\n\r\nWhen the work of reconstruction begins in real earnest, when the\r\ncountry, so rich in minerals and with so fertile a soil, can be\r\ndeveloped in peace to the best advantage; then I, for one—now I know\r\nhim—believe “The Pasha” will prove to us that he can unite his people no\r\nless wisely in the building up of their fatherland than in saving it\r\nfrom tyranny and interference.\r\n\r\nThe Nationalists have had their warning from mistakes made by the\r\nCommittee of Union and Progress, against the only real danger one can\r\nreasonably foresee, that of teaching the people to run before they have\r\nlearnt to walk.\r\n\r\nTo all who would see the vision realised of an established, strong, and\r\nwell-governed new Turkey, I only say: “Take care of your Pasha, for ‘his\r\nvalue is above rubies.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n            AN INTERVIEW WITH THE GHAZI MUSTAPHA KEMAL PASHA\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Ghazi M. Kemal Pasha granted me the following interview just after\r\nthe conference at Lausanne had assembled.\r\n\r\n“To what extent, if any, has the attitude of the Grand National Assembly\r\nbeen responsible for setting public opinion against the Turks?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Our attitude has never changed. All reports of inconsistency are false,\r\nand circulated by the clever propaganda of our enemies. The Government\r\nhas to render account of itself not only to a Chamber of Deputies, but\r\nto History; and no responsible or self-respecting Ministry could act\r\nwith such disloyalty to its own principles, the very spirit of its\r\nbeing, as the Press has accused it of revealing. All these false reports\r\ncome from those Englishmen, some of them official, who are working to\r\nprolong the war, a crime no one can lay on our shoulders. You know of\r\nthe untiring efforts we made for peace, and you know the result. In any\r\ncase, though personally accused, I am not responsible. I am only\r\nPresident of the Assembly. The Assembly is not one man.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think that a really _sincere entente_ can be established between\r\nTurkey and Great Britain?”\r\n\r\n“I do not think, I am _certain_, that we shall eventually return to the\r\nold traditional friendship. There are no reasons against, and so many in\r\nfavour of, that course. We make no demands beyond respect and honour for\r\nour independence. We have sent away our Sultan to secure greater\r\nfreedom, and to prevent all risk of danger to our independence.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think that the Conference will produce good results?”\r\n\r\n“Eventually there can be no doubt that, however heated and however\r\nprolonged the discussions, it will bring peace. Unfortunately, we cannot\r\nwait for ever: The Powers should recognise now, what they must\r\nultimately admit, that we could not accept terms which would deny us\r\nthat liberty for which we have sacrificed so much and fought with such\r\nstern resolve.\r\n\r\n“For every reason, we desire peace; a settlement that will enable us to\r\nget on with the vital work of reconstruction. Details must take time,\r\nbut the essential question should have been arranged before this.”\r\n\r\n“The papers accuse Angora of arrogance and zenophobia,” I reminded him.\r\n\r\n“The charge is invented for propaganda. Is it _arrogant_ to stand out\r\nfor our just and logical rights ? Of ‘zenophobia’ I know nothing! My\r\nwhole life, in every action, is proof that I do _not_ hate Europe. I\r\nnever fought for hate, but to save the truth. The same inspiration\r\nguides and controls our politics.\r\n\r\n“I could never myself keep on hating a nation for the mistakes of its\r\nGovernment. I fought against the Bulgarians, who are my greatest friends\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\n“And towards the Greeks I feel the same. I am confident that we shall\r\nsoon be great friends, friends as we were before the Powers intervened.\r\nAs they were led away by false flatterers, they will be the first to see\r\ntheir mistake and repent.”\r\n\r\n“Have you banished the Christians, or are they leaving Anatolia in mere\r\npanic?”\r\n\r\n“We have taken no steps in this matter, but left them absolutely free,\r\nto go or stay. They have been terrified by propaganda, largely American,\r\ndirected by religious animosities. While they followed the Greek army in\r\nthousands, and are still flying, many others are coming back. To-day you\r\ncan see two long streams of refugees among us, one leaving, the other\r\nreturning. They know that all Christians, whether our own subjects or\r\nforeigners, will always enjoy, as they _have_ always enjoyed, the full\r\nliberties accorded them in every civilised country.”\r\n\r\n“Are you satisfied with the situation in Constantinople?”\r\n\r\n“We shall keep faith to the promise we made at Moudania. Meanwhile it is\r\nunnatural to see foreign troops in Constantinople, and they should be\r\ntaken away as soon as possible. Their presence involves abnormal\r\nconditions, which have made it necessary for us to administer that\r\nvillayet from the Assembly at Angora—an indignity which should not be\r\nprolonged.\r\n\r\n“While conversations are maintained in Lausanne, and since everyone\r\nknows we must keep Constantinople, the Powers should not insist on the\r\narmed guarantee.”\r\n\r\n“Do you congratulate us on having secured a Conservative Government?”\r\n\r\n“It is early days, surely, to speak! If they will help us to friendly\r\nrelations with England and the other Powers, that is all we ask. Your\r\nparties are not our business. We are, generally speaking, against all\r\npolicies of expansion, because they lead nations into the abyss; and, in\r\nour judgment, such policies are impolitic.”\r\n\r\n“What are your views on the Freedom of the Straits?”\r\n\r\n“Like the delegates at Lausanne, we want _real_ freedom, not freedom in\r\nthe hands of one Power. We are ready to discuss the problem with all who\r\nhave any interests in that quarter. There can be no freedom till\r\nConstantinople and the Sea of Marmora are secure.\r\n\r\n“We must have national frontiers; that is, all territories peopled by\r\nTurks. We accept for boundaries or limit the enemy-lines as they were\r\nwhen the Armistice was signed. Is that an unreasonable claim in return\r\nfor all we have given up from the old Ottoman Empire?\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GENERAL ISMET PASHA.\r\n  MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS.\r\n  FIRST TURKISH DELEGATE AT THE LAUSANNE PEACE CONFERENCE.\r\n  p. 176\r\n]\r\n\r\n“Towards ‘minorities’ we stand by the National Pact, confirmed by the\r\nrecent Treaty with France, signed at Angora. We are fully prepared, nay\r\nanxious, to recognise all such rights as have been given to minorities\r\nin the different treaties between the Powers—since the war. It must,\r\nhowever, be clearly understood that foreign control, inconsistent with\r\nthe absolute independence we demand, is _impossible_.\r\n\r\n“Nor can we grant any special privileges for Capitulations to the\r\nsubjects of foreign nations who may choose to live in Turkey. They are\r\nwelcome to _precisely the same rights_ as our own subjects enjoy, but we\r\nwill never recognise any such privileges to foreigners as are unknown,\r\nfor instance, in France, England, or America. Those who would still\r\nchallenge our claim to the complete independence that we are determined\r\nto secure will have to find means to exterminate all Turks now inspired\r\nby that ideal. But I am confident that such a slaughter would not be\r\npermitted by the civilised world. Civilisation, on the contrary, will\r\nsoon learn that our Turkey has her place in the future. She will help,\r\nand not hinder, civilisation. Civilisation must, therefore, be\r\ninterested in, and support, her independence.”\r\n\r\nOn December 22nd, the _Morning Post_ printed the following leading\r\narticle about this interview:\r\n\r\n    The interview which Mustapha Kemal Pasha has given our\r\n    Correspondent emphasises the one supreme result so far reached\r\n    at Lausanne, namely, that the new rulers of Turkey are willing\r\n    and indeed anxious to resume friendly relations with this\r\n    country. The compromise which is apparently on the point of\r\n    being reached at Lausanne concerning the Straits and the\r\n    demilitarised zones may not survive the touch of reality and the\r\n    sharp breath of war. But that is no reason why we should deplore\r\n    or despise such a settlement, for it is at least a sign of\r\n    goodwill, an offer on the part of Turkey to come to an agreement\r\n    with the Western Powers, who, by the strange irony of fate, are\r\n    the real friends of Turkey and yet were forced in the Great War\r\n    to call themselves her enemies. The Lausanne Conference has\r\n    dealt with and perhaps settled the Thracian boundaries, the\r\n    protection of minorities, and the guardianship of the Straits,\r\n    and there remains for it now to secure an agreement regarding\r\n    the capitulations, the Patriarchate, and the future of Mosul.\r\n    But the real importance of Lausanne lies in the fact that the\r\n    world now realises that Kemalist Turkey is not the cat’s-paw of\r\n    Bolshevist Russia, that the Turkish Nationalists did not defeat\r\n    one invader in order to put themselves at the mercy of another,\r\n    and that the ambitious plan of Moscow for using Turkey as a pawn\r\n    in the great game of destroying British dominion in the East is\r\n    in all probability doomed to failure. It is too early yet to say\r\n    that the Bolshevicks have been outwitted, but both in their\r\n    silences and their speeches there are evidences of chagrin. They\r\n    have found out that Lausanne is not Genoa and that, if we may\r\n    thus describe him, Curzon _libre_ is a very different person\r\n    from Curzon _enchaîné_. Chicherin had his Rapallo. Perhaps it\r\n    was his final triumph.\r\n\r\n    Kemal, in his interview, said: “I am certain we shall eventually\r\n    return to the traditional friendship between Turkey and Britain.\r\n    I can see no obstacle thereto.” With the fall of the Coalition\r\n    Government, the last obstacle has gone. Lord Curzon has been\r\n    firm with the Turks, but not venomous, frank but not insulting.\r\n    He can afford to leave rude harangues and offensive imprecations\r\n    to the congress of fallen angels now assembling at Algeciras.\r\n    Indeed, all the declarations of the Foreign Secretary go to show\r\n    that he is sincerely anxious to reach a durable and friendly\r\n    settlement with the emissaries of Angora, and that if he is\r\n    determined to uphold the rights of the British, he is equally\r\n    ready to acknowledge the independence of the Turkish Empire. We\r\n    are glad to see that Kemal is anxious to reciprocate, and\r\n    therein he shows himself to be not only a soldier but a\r\n    statesman. For his task is not yet ended; indeed it is only\r\n    beginning. He has saved his country from the Greek; he must now\r\n    save it from the moth and rust of economic decay. In that great\r\n    task he will find Great Britain his best friend. Fethi Bey has\r\n    doubtless made it clear to him how much Europe can contribute to\r\n    the economic reconstruction of Turkey, and a recent statement of\r\n    Mr. Morgenthau should convince him that the United States will\r\n    be a reluctant and difficult lender. In the long run he has to\r\n    choose between free co-operation with Great Britain and an\r\n    enslavement at the mercy of Bolshevist Russia. He seems already\r\n    to have chosen the better course; for the sake of his country,\r\n    and ours, we hope and believe that he will persist in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n         MUSTAPHA KEMAL PASHA—THE MAN WHO IS MASTER OF HIS FATE\r\n\r\n\r\nMY eye fell on the portrait of a handsome Turkish lady, which was\r\nhanging over the Pasha’s writing-desk.\r\n\r\n“What a lovely face!” I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“My mother,” said the Pasha, with obvious pride.\r\n\r\n“Would it be very indiscreet,” said I, “to ask if I might have the great\r\npleasure of seeing her?”\r\n\r\n“She is very ill. The doctors are with her day and night. Alas, I fear\r\nshe can never recover.”\r\n\r\nWe afterwards went up the staircase to the invalid’s apartments. To my\r\nsurprise, we found her seated on a wide divan, supported by cushions. It\r\nwas difficult at first to believe that she was so near the end.\r\n\r\n“Alas!” said Mustapha Kemal, “her suffering has come through me. She is\r\npaying back now the tears and anguish she spent for me in exile.” There\r\nwas sorrow in his voice, too heart-broken for many words.\r\n\r\n“Now you can take part in his victory,” I said. “How proud you must be\r\nof your son. His is a wonderful story. I am proud only to have spoken\r\nwith him and seen his work.”\r\n\r\nShe thanked me with great feeling, and said she believed “God had sent\r\nher this son to save the Fatherland—but my son is always kind to me.”\r\n\r\nWhilst giving me a beautiful silk handkerchief, scented with her\r\nfavourite perfume, she asked whether she had not seen me before, ten\r\nyears ago, in Constantinople.\r\n\r\n“She has a marvellous memory,” the Pasha murmured.\r\n\r\nIn a few days there were to be no more opportunities for any of us to\r\nsee this dear lady!\r\n\r\nWhen, later, in Constantinople, I ventured upon some allusion to the\r\ngreat devotion he always evinced to his mother, a Turk said: “That is\r\nonly natural—Oriental, if you will. The man whose hands are steeped in\r\nblood, whose soul is black with crime, yet bows in respect to his\r\nmother. You might as well be surprised that the sun shines.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe story of M. Kemal’s youth and of his brilliant career is, of course,\r\nwell known in Anatolia. He was born in Salonica in 1880, and there are\r\nlegends that many who saw the boy, “fair as the corn,” at his games,\r\nwould say: “Look well at that little fellow. He will one day be the\r\nsaviour of his country.”\r\n\r\nSt. Jeanne d’Arc’s “Life,” you remember, begins with a description of\r\nthe countryside on the night of her birth—“all the animals seemed\r\nstrangely excited. There was a chorus of approval from the chickens, the\r\ngeese, and the pigs.” “Very possibly,” as a friend once commented on\r\nthis passage, “it all happened again on the night each of us was born,\r\nbut no one noticed it.”\r\n\r\nSo I will speak only of facts. A year ago, how few had even heard his\r\nname! How often the Unknown Personality has appeared, just when hope\r\nseemed dead, to save his country!\r\n\r\nM. Kemal’s father died when he was quite a child, though already\r\nattending the school of Chemsi Effendi. Then, for a few years, his\r\nmother took him to stay with an uncle in the country, and life became\r\none glorious game in the sunny fields, shooting at rooks, stealing\r\nNature’s secrets, and flourishing on all the delights of being naughty\r\nwith no one to interfere.\r\n\r\nAlthough his mother seems to have felt, however, that young minds cannot\r\nsafely be left long undisciplined, and, therefore, brought him back to\r\nschool at Salonica, the experiment did not prove a success. Like other\r\nunusual boys, he was always in hot water and, in the end, was allowed to\r\ncome home and play at soldiers.\r\n\r\nIt was Edison’s unsympathetic schoolmistress who told _his_ mother:\r\n“This boy’s brain is addled, we can do nothing with him.” He had given\r\none of his companions a seidlitz powder to find out whether the gas\r\nwould lift up his patient into the air! Mrs. Edison was wise enough to\r\ntake the boy’s education into her own hands, proving herself “the\r\nloveliest and most wonderful teacher on God’s earth,” as he afterwards\r\ndeclared.\r\n\r\nAs the Pasha’s mother did not approve of soldiering, the boy simply took\r\nhimself off to a military college, passed the examinations with\r\ndistinction, and then proudly confronted her with all his certificates!\r\nHe was both hard-working and intelligent, devoted to French and\r\nmathematics.\r\n\r\nBut even as a schoolboy his country’s suffering must have eaten into his\r\nardent imagination. I was told that he would spend hours of recreation\r\nin making speeches and organising a committee, to protest against the\r\ntyranny of Abdul Hamid. Already he felt that an army was not enough to\r\nsave his country, and persuaded some of his schoolfellows to study\r\npolitics, sowing the seed of all he has since given to the world.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning he determined, above all, to make himself master of\r\nevery detail concerning the French Revolution; to understand, by\r\nunderstanding “the people,” why it happened and how it happened, what\r\nmistakes were made, the real ideals that inspired its passion of\r\nsacrifice, and the permanent gains it brought to France and to mankind.\r\n\r\nLong after all his companions were fast asleep, the young Mustapha dived\r\ninto every possible book he could lay hands on, to clear up this\r\nfascinating subject. Next morning he would hold forth to all and sundry\r\nupon his discoveries, and finally issued a paper with exemplary\r\nregularity, which was widely circulated in manuscript.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile military studies had not been neglected; He was promoted Staff\r\nCaptain, and—through under-hand channels—“recommended” to the notice of\r\nAbdul Hamid, who promptly exiled him to Syria.\r\n\r\nIn Damascus, Beyrout, and Jaffa, his more revolutionary plans matured.\r\nAt last the Constitution was proclaimed, and he was able to join his\r\nmother in Salonica!—not yet, however, for the quiet of a restored home\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAt the time when the troops marched to deliver Constantinople from the\r\nreactionaries, he was appointed Chief of Staff to Mahmoud Chefket Pasha.\r\nDuring the Tripolitain War he was first at Syrenaique, and afterwards at\r\nBenghazi.\r\n\r\nWhen the Great War broke out, he was military attaché at Sofia, but was\r\nimmediately despatched to the command of a Division in the Dardanelles,\r\nand, when this had been formed and organised, marched to Gallipoli. It\r\nwas he who defeated the English forces, not only in Gallipoli, but at\r\nAnafarta.\r\n\r\nAfter we had been driven out of the Dardanelles, he went to the Caucasus\r\nin command of the 15th Army Corps, and recovered Bitlis and Mouche from\r\nthe Russians. For a time he led the 6th Army Corps, under the German\r\nGeneral Falkenhayn; but nothing could reconcile him to his chief’s\r\nmethods and the reckless loss of life they involved. He therefore\r\nresigned and went back to Constantinople.\r\n\r\nAfter accompanying the present Khalif on a visit to Hindenberg and\r\nLudendorff, he tells me that, when he thus first clearly saw into the\r\nreal issue of the war; he also saw, even more clearly, the need for\r\nmaking his own plans in Turkey.\r\n\r\nHe was in Syria when the Armistice was signed; and returning with high\r\nhopes to Constantinople, sank broken-hearted before the treachery of\r\nMudros! But not for long.\r\n\r\nNever the man to nurse despair, he quickly rose again to his country’s\r\ncall. Offered the post of Inspector of the East (that is, High\r\nFunctionary of the Eastern Villayets), he accepted at once, and hurried\r\ninto Anatolia to prepare for resistance.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment he stepped out at Samsoun, _the movement began_.\r\n\r\nWhat shall we say of the “Man at the Helm—the Hero and the Genius?” Were\r\nhis “Destinies,” indeed, “written on the tablets of heaven”; or may he\r\nnot rather claim:\r\n\r\n                        “I am Master of my Fate\r\n                         I am Captain of my Soul”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEvery detail of the work had to be built up, as it were, stone by stone,\r\nentirely afresh—an army to be found anywhere and everywhere from\r\nnothing. Yet it was trained and organised to become, what Colonel Mougin\r\ntells me, is “the best-disciplined and best-officered army in the\r\nworld.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps the Battle of the Sakharia, lasting fifteen days without\r\ninterruption, may be quoted as the Great Victory. It was certainly one\r\nof the battles of this century. When one of the majors asked for\r\ninstructions about “the line provided for retreat,” he was told: “There\r\nwill be no retreat. Advance, or die in your trenches!”\r\n\r\nOn the anniversary of the Battle of the In-Enus, Ismet Pasha told me a\r\nlittle about his victory, and what it meant. What victory _must_ mean\r\nwhen you have nothing with which to conquer.\r\n\r\nAlready the military experts have written pages about the advance and\r\nthe victory. One day, we hope, “The Pasha” will give us his own version.\r\n\r\nHow, again, shall we tell the endurance of the people, suffering through\r\nlong years in silence and alone? To us who could but look on them,\r\npitying and admiring from a distance, it seemed as if someone _must_ get\r\nthrough somehow to offer the hand of friendship and give, at least,\r\nheartfelt sympathy. I tried, but it could not be done. Even now, I\r\ncannot say all it has cost me to reach Angora!\r\n\r\nMustapha Kemal must put on record “The Birth of a Nation”; and from\r\nHalidé Hanoum we want the thousand and one pictures of the agony of\r\nsimple folk—desolate village homes, women who weep _and_ work, the\r\nlittle ones crying, “What is it, mother?”; all that war means to men,\r\nall that men can endure for liberty and the right.\r\n\r\n“What does it matter,” she has written, “though the world call us\r\npariah? We will die with honour. What does it matter if food be denied\r\nus by all our neighbours? Our own soil will keep us alive, sheltered in\r\nsackcloth!”\r\n\r\nAt Lausanne the patriot-passion is taunted for its arrogance. It is\r\nforgotten that self-made nations, like men, if made with honour, have\r\ncertain rights and duties, which the most illustrious and ancient\r\nlineage cannot bestow. Moreover, we carry with ease what has come down\r\nto us through the centuries; what we have suffered and fought for, we\r\ngrasp, crying maybe somewhat loudly: “Hands off!” To be in Turkey, and\r\nto learn of the heroism of her people, is to understand her moderation.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI was naturally keenly interested in the Pasha’s views on women; I have\r\nbeen still more interested to hear that, since I was at Angora, he has\r\nput his theories into practice.\r\n\r\nI have never spoken in England or the United States without having to\r\nanswer the most absurd questions on life in a harem. This time, in\r\nLondon, the old nonsense was trotted out, and my replies either invented\r\nor distorted.\r\n\r\nI was interviewed during our own Suffrage agitation, and expressed my\r\nconviction that “women _must_ either have full liberty to earn their\r\nlivelihoods in any profession, _or_ be sheltered and protected as\r\nTurkish women are sheltered and protected.” Next morning a large poster\r\nappeared with the legend, _under my portrait_, “English writer urges\r\npolygamy!”\r\n\r\nThe paper inserted my prompt denial, but, of course, that never was read\r\nby thousands who had swallowed the poster. A Glasgow paper, indeed, was\r\nconsiderate enough to remark that, “knowing my people were\r\nPresbyterians, the kindest interpretation was—insanity!”\r\n\r\nAmerican pressmen were particularly furious with me for asserting that\r\npolygamy does not exist in Turkey, and that no Turkish women would put\r\nup with the European system of “establishments.” When they persisted\r\nthat “Turks had more than one wife,” I asked, “why many men, who lacked\r\nthe means or courage to ever marry, yet supposed the men of the East\r\ncould each have four?”\r\n\r\nIn my judgment, “Progress for Women” has _begun_ on far sounder lines in\r\nTurkey than elsewhere. The occasion has come to help them, and I believe\r\nthey are ready to meet it. There is to-day so much to be done for their\r\ncountry that few, surely, will hesitate to come forward and stand beside\r\nthe men in the great work. Temptations to rivalry or competition\r\nscarcely exist.\r\n\r\nTen years ago, that eloquent and graceful speaker, Hamdoullah Soubhi,\r\nwas urging the women to freedom, bidding them cast off their veils and\r\nhelp to govern the country. To-day it is Mustapha Kemal himself who, in\r\nseason and out of season, is calling on them to break for ever with the\r\nharem, and learn to be helpmates to their husbands.\r\n\r\nI have said and written, over and over again, that women should not, and\r\nneed not, compete with men. That is not the real road to freedom.\r\nLiberty dwelleth among comrades, and shuns a rival.\r\n\r\n“This time next year,” said Mustapha Kemal, “woman must be free. She\r\nmust uncover her face and mix with men.”\r\n\r\n“How will the men like it?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“It matters little what they like or dislike. Freedom must come.”\r\n\r\nHe has no more patience with tradition in men’s dress. “When summer\r\ncomes and our kalpaks are too hot, we shall wear hats with ‘brims,’ to\r\nprotect us from the sun. The time is past for ‘dress’ to reveal the\r\n‘race’. We should dress for comfort.”\r\n\r\nHamid Bey and other delegates at Lausanne are of the same opinion. They\r\nsay the old conventional way of dressing “stamps the Turk in Europe as a\r\nmember of an inferior race.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTaking my courage in both hands, I ventured to mention the fear his\r\nfriends had expressed to me, of his marrying a princess.\r\n\r\n“That will never happen,” he replied. “I have already chosen an educated\r\nwoman of my own people, with character enough to be ‘equal partner’ in\r\nall my work. There can be no happiness in union for only _half_ one’s\r\ncharacter and one’s life. But I stand for democracy, and was never\r\nattracted by rank.”\r\n\r\nEveryone now is talking of Mustapha Kemal’s future wife. The ring was\r\nbought for him at Lausanne by the delegates, who were as excited about\r\nthe business as any school-children. His neighbours, sweet little Mme.\r\nRuchène Echref and her talented husband are beside themselves with\r\ndelighted anticipation of having so charming a _châtelaine_ at\r\nTchan-Kaya.\r\n\r\nMme. Ruchène told me that the Pasha was staying with his future\r\nfather-in-law during the Moudania Conference, and that Latifée Hanoum\r\nproved herself most helpful over all his despatches, as she speaks and\r\nwrites excellent English and French.\r\n\r\nThe wife to be could have no better sponsor than Mme. Echref! She and\r\nher husband, like Adnan Bey and Halidé Hanoum, gave up everything to\r\nfollow the Pasha. They would not, however, allow me ever to speak of\r\ntheir sacrifices, or tell the tale of their many tragic sufferings in\r\nall parts of Turkey. Now, indeed, their dear little two-roomed cabin, so\r\ntastefully furnished with its beautiful pictures, may well stand for\r\n“love in a cottage.” She does a great deal of Red Crescent work among\r\nthe women who are still so active in helping the refugees of Anatolia.\r\n\r\nOne only wishes that the other social reforms, splendidly started in\r\nConstantinople, had not been so long interrupted. But like education,\r\nand all other real progress, they cannot survive long wars. What\r\ncriminal waste that means for mankind!\r\n\r\nI have talked with many Turkish brides, received many confidences, and\r\nthe whole question of marriage in Turkey has always interested me\r\nimmensely.\r\n\r\nThe first Turkish bride I ever met, long years ago, had never seen her\r\nhusband before marriage, and detested him from the first. “There is\r\nnothing the matter with him,” she admitted, “_except_ that I don’t like\r\nhim.” Ultimately she managed to escape, married a man of her own choice,\r\nand was twenty times more unhappy.\r\n\r\nAnother bride told me that, as a great favour, she was allowed to see\r\nher future husband, and has regretted it ever since. “The dreadful\r\nimprudence seems to have robbed life of all its romance!”\r\n\r\nYet one more confession! “I peeped through the lattice-window to look at\r\nhim as he walked past. Quite an uninteresting little man, but he was ‘my\r\nfate’ and I might have ‘been given’ something worse.” But, at her\r\nwedding, I found a tall and handsome bridegroom. “What does this mean?”\r\nI asked. “What has happened?” And she answered quite calmly: “I must\r\nhave looked out at the wrong man.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTewfik Rushdi Bey declares that it is “easy divorce” in Turkey which\r\nmakes their marriages so happy _and_ lasting. I gladly pass on the\r\nparadox to all English advocates for “marriage reform”; only bidding\r\nthem remember that Turkish husbands accept big risks at the start. They\r\nnever hesitate about trusting their mothers to “pick a winner in life’s\r\nhandicap”; and, since young Western people, one and all, prefer their\r\nown way to their parents’, all the “wisdom of the East” may leave them\r\ncold.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEuropean bridegrooms must always experience a sense of being “outsiders”\r\nat their own weddings; but at least we expect them to be there! In\r\nTurkey, the signatures of bride and bridegroom are not affixed to the\r\ncontract in each other’s presence, and often not even on the same day.\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to add that the guests belong to the bride’s\r\nparty, and are entertained at _her_ house. To us it certainly is strange\r\nto hear the solemn questions addressed to the bride by the Imam that\r\npledge her life to an “absentee” partner, whom she has never set eyes\r\non. I can still remember a beautiful wedding-dress of white satin\r\nbrocade, embroidered with silver stars, over which sparkled a large\r\ndiadem of diamonds. All brides, too, wear a shower of silver threads\r\nround the neck, from which they pull out threads to give their friends\r\nfor “good luck.”\r\n\r\n“Good luck” at a wedding naturally means a good husband, and from the\r\nnumber of threads I have received, there should be at least fifty\r\n“eligible partners” somewhere in waiting for me.\r\n\r\nWe, in our turn, wish happiness to the bride on her bridal throne, as we\r\npass before her in solemn procession. Last of all comes the feast, for\r\nwomen only, after which the happy couple are, at last, “introduced.”\r\n\r\nAt this charming and strange ceremony I also witnessed a fine example of\r\ntrue democracy as practised in the East. Among the guests in their\r\nelaborate ball-dresses, trimmed with orange blossom, I noticed the Grand\r\nVizier’s wife; and then, catching sight of a very differently attired\r\ngroup of women, wearing faded and worn tcharchaffs and feradjés, I\r\nrealised that the “bath-women” of the family had come uninvited to the\r\nfeast! And the door of the harem was wide open, that _all_ might enter\r\nin to see the presents, admire the dresses, and all the other delightful\r\nfeminine intimacies of such an occasion.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, I was told by Zeyneb, _any_ woman can go to a\r\nTurkish wedding without having been invited. “_You_, in England, only\r\nask your intimate friends, and yet you have to employ detectives to\r\nwatch the presents.”\r\n\r\nWhen my attendant, Cadem Haïr (whose colour led me to call her Miss\r\nChocolate) became engaged to a coffee-coloured railway official, she was\r\ntreated like one of the family by the Pasha’s household. Fatma and I\r\nbought her trousseau, we arranged for her to be photographed, and\r\nsecured a Kara Kheuz (or Punch and Judy show) for the wedding\r\nfestivities.\r\n\r\nSo many confidences, so many romances and love-stories inside the\r\nImperial harem, and outside! They would fill a volume.\r\n\r\nI have never met an “old maid” in Turkey, and I doubt whether one could\r\nbe found. I well remember the distress and anxieties of a certain matron\r\nwhose daughter was still unmarried at twenty-eight. The girl had\r\nresolutely refused all offers, and her poor mother could only suppose\r\nshe had been bewitched. Then one day _he_ appeared, and that story had a\r\nhappy ending.\r\n\r\nWhether the reforms Mustapha Kemal is so determined to promote will\r\nsubstantially diminish the number of early marriages, one cannot, of\r\ncourse, foresee. At present, fortunately, the most brilliant, practical,\r\nand advanced Turkish women have found _their own_ sphere, and do not\r\nenter into open competition with men. If they are tempted to follow our\r\nWestern feminists, to steal, not only men’s prestige, but their bread\r\nand butter, domestic chaos and anarchy may spread to the East.\r\n\r\nFor the moment, one does not expect advance beyond “The Pasha’s” own\r\nstriking example. He has not only chosen his own bride, but dispensed\r\nwith the Imam—a parallel to the first Englishman who dared to marry in a\r\nregistry office!\r\n\r\nI always said this man would scatter many _coupés d’état_, once peace\r\nwas signed; but he has not waited for the signature!\r\n\r\nThe originality of his gifts to the bride recalls the Prophet of Islam.\r\nMahomet gave his daughter a Koran, a prayer-carpet, and a coffee-mill;\r\nMustapha Kemal has given his wife-to-be General Trécoupis’ revolver and\r\nan Arab horse! She is an excellent rider, sitting astride, with the veil\r\nonly confining her hair.\r\n\r\nI much regret that I was never able to find an opportunity of meeting\r\nthis lady, partly because she was educated at Chislehurst, almost next\r\ndoor to my own school—Rochester.\r\n\r\nInevitably the Pasha’s liberal attitude towards marriage has been\r\ncriticised, and described as “in direct opposition to the principles of\r\nIslam.” He, however, will not admit the charge.\r\n\r\nIt is true that, at the very door of Europe, women have been content to\r\nlive through the centuries in a comfortable material security, that\r\nmeans being cut out of all the realities of life, and all the serious\r\njoys or sorrows of existence. It is not unnatural that isolation should\r\nhave kept them down so long.\r\n\r\nBut the harem was _not_ invented by the Turks, and has nothing in common\r\nwith the nomad existence of the Great Preacher of the Deserts. Polygamy\r\nand the harem were first introduced when the Turks entered Byzantium as\r\nconquerors. They served, in those troublous times, as the best means\r\navailable for the protection of women, and proved a fine school of\r\ninstruction for Georgian Circassian slaves.\r\n\r\nIt is false to say that Eastern women have blamed their religion for the\r\nevils, so many now recognise, of seclusion. The most ignorant are quite\r\nfamiliar with the great names of women who have been the glory of Islam.\r\nMahomet’s own daughter, the “Lady of Paradise,” spoke to large audiences\r\nof dusky-skinned Arabs, her face unveiled. Neither did Zeyneb, the\r\nfamous and beautiful professor at the University of Bagdad, wear the\r\nveil. Khadidja sang in public, her own beautiful songs, still known and\r\nadmired all over the East. Rhadyah, one of the first great travellers\r\namong these lands, was also an eloquent lecturer, applauded by the most\r\nlearned men of Islam.\r\n\r\nTherefore are not the women themselves to blame for their prolonged\r\nisolation? or was it the régime of Abdul Hamed?\r\n\r\nMustapha Kemal has not only offered his wife the privileges Mahomet\r\naccorded to his daughter, but he has swept from the path of Islam the\r\nretrograde heresies that Byzantium grafted on to the Faith.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n A TURKISH CABINET—THE THREE BEST-KNOWN MINISTERS—A CABINET OF YOUNG MEN\r\n\r\n\r\nUNLIKE the European type to which we are accustomed, the Cabinet of the\r\nAssembly is almost exclusively composed of very young men, possessed,\r\nhowever, of the strong determination to serve their country.\r\n\r\nMustapha Kemal Pasha has great faith in youth, and his oldest minister\r\nis probably no more than forty-two. “Youth,” he said, “makes mistakes\r\nthat can be corrected; age and experience make the mistakes of routine.”\r\nFethi Bey, who is the chief’s right hand, also believes in youth, and\r\nwas himself a minister at thirty-two.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  RAUF BEY—PRIME MINISTER.\r\n  EX-NAVAL OFFICER.\r\n  He speaks perfect English and knows England better than any other\r\n    Turk.\r\n  p. 192\r\n]\r\n\r\nHere, again, the Prime Minister and his Cabinet are independent, the one\r\nof the other. One may fall, while the other remains. I am inclined to\r\nthink, on closer examination, that the Ministers are seldom entrusted\r\nwith the initiative and responsibility which _our_ Ministers, in theory\r\nat least, enjoy; although for them all criticism and supervision comes,\r\nas it were, from below. They might, perhaps, be best described as Heads\r\nof Departments, whose every action is open to all eyes in the Assembly,\r\nsubmitted to the keenest scrutiny, and freely discussed. Sometimes they\r\nseem able to keep their position after heated discussions and\r\ninterpolations, but, on the other hand, they may fall in consequence of\r\nsome detail which, with us, would pass unnoticed—such as the nomination\r\nof an unsatisfactory functionary. They are all, certainly, very able\r\nmen; with extraordinary energy, enthusiasm, and devotion. Although not\r\nconstituted as a formal Cabinet, they meet to consider the most\r\nimportant questions that will come before the Assembly. Mustapha Kemal\r\nPasha is entitled to preside at these meetings whenever he desires to be\r\npresent; but, as a rule, the Chair is taken by Rauf Bey, Prime Minister\r\nwithout a Portfolio. They are not appointed by the President or the\r\nPrime Minister, but _elected_ by the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\nI have discussed this system with many of our European statesmen, who,\r\none and all—including Lord Curzon—do not consider that it could\r\npermanently work well or be successfully applied to any stable,\r\nimportant State.\r\n\r\nThe Turks, however, maintain that a Minister should only be elected to\r\nwatch, as it were, the special interests and concerns of his Department,\r\nand that the _People_ themselves should be _responsible_, through their\r\nrepresentatives in Parliament, for _all_ legislation. The Assembly\r\ncontrols both law-making and administration.\r\n\r\nFor them, of course, we of the West cannot decide, or, perhaps, judge.\r\nWe have scarcely of late years earned the right to criticise!\r\n\r\nRauf Bey is a man of about forty, a gentleman as we understand the word,\r\nwho has travelled among the best intellects of Europe, and had the\r\ncourage and energy to adapt many ideals thus acquired to the needs of\r\nhis own country. His brilliance and his devotion are universally\r\nacknowledged.\r\n\r\nFormerly a Naval officer, he distinguished himself in all the wars of\r\nthe last twenty-five years; and his command of the _Hamidieh_ in the\r\nBalkan War, against the whole of the Greek Fleet, is not yet forgotten.\r\nAs Marine Minister in Izzet Pasha’s Cabinet he accompanied General\r\nTownshend and Admiral Calthorpe to Mudros, and signed the Armistice with\r\nthe Allies. In the Chamber of Deputies at Constantinople he did not\r\nhesitate to avow his allegiance to Mustapha Kemal, and was consequently\r\none of the first to be arrested by the English and sent to Malta.\r\nHandsome, intelligent, a hard worker, subtle and liberal-minded, he very\r\nsoon came to the front. He was the first Vice-President of the Assembly,\r\nand became Prime Minister last May. During the absence of Ismet Pasha at\r\nLausanne, he also acted as Minister of Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\nI heard him several times during my stay in Angora, and his fearless\r\nspeeches were not only a political event, but always caused something of\r\na sensation outside the capital.\r\n\r\nHe has never disguised his love for England, nor what he owes to her\r\neducation. The disillusion after Mudros and at Malta was hard to bear.\r\nHe had not only to mourn for a shattered idol, but to suffer abuse from\r\nhis fellow-countrymen for a trust of which he had been so proud.\r\n\r\nHe is, however, far too intelligent to quarrel with a whole nation for\r\nthe errors of its Government. “The future depends on England,” he said;\r\n“we can do nothing to improve relations until peace is signed; but there\r\nwill be abundant opportunities in the future, and, if England is\r\nwilling, she can come to us then.”\r\n\r\n“In six months,” I replied, “we shall be as great friends as ever we\r\nwere.”\r\n\r\n“That, again, depends entirely upon you.”\r\n\r\nI asked him whether large concessions had been made to France in return\r\nfor her political support.\r\n\r\n“As the first to understand the Nationalist movement,” he replied, “we\r\nowe her a great moral debt; which I have myself acknowledged and called\r\non the world to witness. But for concessions, the field is open to all.\r\nWe shall, naturally, accept the most advantageous offer.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRauf Bey has strong theories about education; and has determined that it\r\nshall be made to develop the new Ideal. He closed a school at Adalia\r\nbecause the children had been taught that Smyrna is Greek and the\r\nEastern villayets are Armenian. “Every Turk should learn that Smyrna has\r\nnever been Greek; an alien minority, protected by foreign powers, has\r\nbeen the cause of all our troubles.”\r\n\r\nIt is, obviously, of the first importance that Turkish children should\r\nbe inspired, from the beginning, with loyalty to the Fatherland by\r\nknowing the fine story of its growth. “We need schools, and good foreign\r\nschools,” said Rauf Bey, “but until they will work under our supervision\r\nand control we show no favour to any offender, French, American or\r\nItalian—we close all.”\r\n\r\nI hear that in the American College at Broussa a Turkish woman has been\r\nappointed to teach geography and history, a concession one hopes will\r\nsoon be generally adopted.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRauf Bey had told me, on board the _Agamemnon_, what had been said to\r\nAdmiral Calthorpe when the Armistice was signed: “We are here to end the\r\nterrible bloodshed of so many years. We accept these terms because we\r\nknow that the great English nation and the Allies will keep their\r\nwords.” Then, to his own officers: “Is it not true, gentlemen, England\r\nalways keeps her word?” and they all answered, “Yes.”\r\n\r\nBut we know what happened!\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo much has been written about his unfortunate reception in London in\r\n1922, that Fethi Bey, the Minister of the Interior, is well known to us.\r\nSeeing that everyone is given a courteous hearing in Turkish Ministries,\r\none feels this unnecessary discourtesy the more. And Fethi Bey, like\r\nMustapha Kemal Pasha and Rauf Bey, was an ardent admirer of England,\r\ncured for ever by the war of any affection for Germany.\r\n\r\nAs an Army officer, for two years military attaché in Paris, secretary\r\nto the Committee of Union and Progress in Sofia, and Minister of the\r\nInterior in Izzet Pasha’s Cabinet, Fethi Bey has had a varied and useful\r\ncareer. During his stay in Sofia, Mustapha Kemal was his military\r\nattaché, and they were both staff captains at Salonika. It was as a\r\nprisoner in Malta that he learnt the fluent English he had so little\r\noccasion to speak in London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFETHI BEY, MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR OF NEW TURKEY.\r\n\r\nNo picture of Angora could be complete without a photo of Fethi Bey. As\r\nthis has not arrived in time, we leave his place empty, as one leaves\r\nthe place of the absent friend at the festive board—unfilled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe is very observant and far-seeing, undemonstrative, and, despite his\r\ncharming smile, bitingly sarcastic; not, perhaps, quite so daring as\r\nRauf Bey, but more level-headed. In a country devastated from end to\r\nend, and lacking in every necessity, he has shown marvellous skill as an\r\norganiser. Very early each morning he leaves his simple villa at\r\nTchan-Kaya for the tiny primitive office in which he “handles” a\r\nconstant stream of callers, busy about every variety of concerns, with\r\nan almost American speed. After a hasty lunch he goes to the Assembly,\r\nand finally rides home, often through many inches of snow, in which no\r\ncar or carriage could make its way.\r\n\r\nThe last of the “three great men” of the Assembly, Ismet Pasha, is well\r\nknown and respected in Europe for his titanic duel with Lord Curzon.\r\n\r\nThough now only thirty-eight, it was he who created, out of nothing, the\r\nfine army which chased the Greeks out of Asia Minor. Victor at the two\r\nIn Eunus, it was he who won back all the enemy-occupied territory as far\r\nas the Mediterranean. As victor also at Moudania, it was he who, with a\r\ndignified courtesy that astonished the whole Conference, defended the\r\n“Nationalist” interests at Lausanne.\r\n\r\nOf the other personalities in the Cabinet one could write much. To\r\nunderstand, and sum up, the strength and importance of the Assembly, one\r\nmust meet and know them all.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n    TURKISH CABINET—THE LESS-KNOWN MINISTERS OF THE SOVEREIGN STATE\r\n\r\n\r\nIN judging the members of the Cabinet one must realise that some of them\r\ndo not speak any European languages, and know little, or nothing, of\r\nWestern ways. In some cases, for example that of Hassan Fehmi Bey, the\r\nMinister of Finance, this is due no doubt to their humble origin. They\r\ntell me, however, he “knows the requirements of New Turkey.”\r\n\r\nThe Minister of Education, Sefa Bey, represents Adana and is somewhat\r\nthe same type of man, reserved and timid to exaggeration.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are many Deputies in the Assembly of wider knowledge and better\r\nunderstanding outside their own country who would seem, at least to us,\r\nmore suitable men for these important Ministries. But we cannot expect\r\nto understand all the influences which determine the election of a\r\nTurkish Cabinet; only hoping that, as the years pass and the Assembly\r\nbecomes concerned with wider issues, it may be led by men, assuredly no\r\nless loyal to their own nation, who yet desire rather to understand our\r\ncivilisation, to live in closer contact with Europe, than merely to turn\r\naway from us as the object of their eternal hate.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe host who has so graciously welcomed me to his home in Angora is\r\nFeszi Bey, Minister of Public Works. He learnt something of Europe, and\r\na little of the French language, when exiled to Malta. I have already\r\nrecorded evidence of his kindness and generosity, which is certainly not\r\nconfined to the horses he shelters with so much care in preference to\r\nany thought of damage his carriage must suffer by exposure. Simple in\r\ntastes and manner, he yet gives one the impression of great power and\r\nactivity; while the remarkable agricultural schemes inaugurated on his\r\nvast estates have been carried out with prudence and success.\r\n\r\nKiazim Pasha, the Minister of National Defence, is a young man on fire\r\nwith energy. He was in command of an army and corps at Sakharia and\r\nlargely responsible for the supplies and the organisations which led the\r\narmy of Ismet Pasha to victory. Like many impulsive natures, he is\r\nsubject to frequent attacks of pessimism, from which I have striven to\r\nrouse him by the assurance that we _will not have_ war.\r\n\r\nThe Minister of Economics, Mahmoud Essad Bey, is, of course, responsible\r\nfor agriculture, commerce, and industry. Having studied these subjects\r\nin Switzerland, his practical activities are guided by sound theoretical\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nAli Fouad Pasha was the distinguished general who fought against the\r\nGreeks in September, 1921, and has succeeded M. Kemal as President of\r\nthe group formed to uphold the “Rights of Roumelia and Anatolia.” The\r\nAssembly itself developed, or grew out of, this little band of patriots,\r\nwho are still its leading spirits, the chief inspirers of its policy. At\r\npresent, the opposition which _does_ exist has very little power or\r\ninfluence; a drawback, as we know to our cost, in any Parliament; which,\r\nhowever, may very well be of temporary advantage to the Assembly until\r\nthe Turks are really secure from external interference.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI was again impressed, almost startled, by the change that is in\r\nprogress in the conditions of life in Turkey, as I looked down upon the\r\npresent Cheik-ul-Islam, called in, “as a mere form,” to depose the\r\nKhalif, with no more ceremony than one directs the dentist to extract a\r\ntooth.\r\n\r\nIn the old days I well remember the odour of incense and sandalwood in\r\nthe sanctuary of Abdul Hamid’s Cheik-ul-Islam, as the great man sat\r\ncross-legged under his enormous pumpkin-hat, amidst the picturesque\r\nsurroundings of historic, ancient, religious ceremony. To him it seemed\r\nthat for a cheik to dethrone a Sultan, as he foresaw must soon be the\r\ncommand, would be a solemn and awful thing. I could not imagine _him_\r\nmodestly waiting for orders, as his successor is waiting to-day. How are\r\nthe mighty fallen!\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThough propaganda has busied itself already, in the attempt to find\r\nflaws in the power and popularity of Mustapha Kemal Pasha, his supremacy\r\nremains unquestioned. So far, when his party says go, the Assembly\r\ngoeth, and when he says come, it cometh.\r\n\r\nIt is certain, nevertheless, that, as the new order settles in its\r\nstride, the Government will be confronted with many difficulties of\r\nwhich we cannot as yet foresee the precise nature. M. Kemal is at least\r\ntwo centuries ahead of some of his own Ministers, four hundred years in\r\nadvance of the peasants, now suddenly, without preparation, made\r\ncitizens of a Republic—a sovereign people. I have seen the peasants in\r\ntheir homes—those charming little pictures out of the sixteenth century.\r\nWithout the least knowledge of, or interest in, what _we_ have come to\r\ncall civilisation, these simple folk have been vegetating through the\r\ncenturies, free from the noise of great cities and the anxieties of\r\nprogress. Though always ready to fight and die, as we say “for King and\r\nCountry,” the symbol of their faith and inherited traditions, they had,\r\nand still have, no idea whatever of any government system, or who makes\r\nthe laws. Naturally sober and religious—not poor, since they had always\r\nenough bread—these children of the soil have known no ambition to\r\nimprove their quiet and happy lives.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt may be Kemal Pasha could do more with only his big Ministers and no\r\nAssembly. On the other hand, quicker progress might prove unsettling,\r\nand the founders of New Turkey need no advice from us. They have chosen\r\nwhat seems to them the better way; we can but pray for their success. No\r\ndoubt, as France floundered through revolution, they will be driven to\r\nface a thousand bitter disappointments and delays. In times that have\r\nwell-nigh submerged the land of the Mother of Parliaments, the Assembly\r\nmust face rocks ahead.\r\n\r\nNow that New and Independent Turkey has her chance, she should take it.\r\nRome was not built in a day; and when difficulties come, as come they\r\nmust, let none scoff with a cheap “I told you so.” Only leave Turkey to\r\nthe Turks, and, like other nations, they will try and try again, until,\r\nat last, they succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n     THE FOREIGN COLONY IN ANGORA—A GROUP OF FOREIGN PERSONALITIES\r\n\r\n\r\nWE cannot complete our record of “Personalities” in Angora without some\r\nmention of the foreigners in residence. Whatever has been asserted,\r\nthere are no Germans there.\r\n\r\nQuite apart from the Turkish officers’ personal antipathy, the Germans\r\nhave no money for concessions; their educational methods would never\r\ntake root in Anatolia; they have lost the legend of military superiority\r\nwhich was the only _raison d’être_ of their influence in the past.\r\nBefore the military genius of the Turks, their great generals have been\r\ncompelled to _baisser pavillon_. Even during the war Turkey saw through\r\nGerman bluff, and the taste of army arrogance was amply efficient to\r\nkill the unnatural alliance for ever. I can definitely assert, by way of\r\nchecking the prominence given to false statements of Teuton influence,\r\nthat _there are no Germans in Angora_.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is true that a subtle form of propaganda is still\r\nat work in Germany itself. There a Turk can obtain, by merely showing a\r\npassport, a document that entitles him to all the “special” terms given\r\nto “natives” at hotels, theatres, and shops.\r\n\r\nI have already described the glories of the Soviet Embassy, and that\r\ndistinguished economist, Camarade Areloff.\r\n\r\nThe Azerbaijan Ambassador, M. Abiloff, represents the four states of the\r\nCaucasian Confederation; whose rather commercial policy is not very\r\npopular.\r\n\r\nSultan Ahmed Khan has been representing Afghanistan in Angora for two\r\nyears. He tells me that any communications with his Government seem\r\nalmost as difficult as with Persia, whose Ambassador has now returned to\r\nhis own country.\r\n\r\nThe personality of Colonel Mougin has done much for the important\r\ncommercial interests of his country, but he is far too wise to imagine\r\nthat France is the Power on whom M. Kemal ultimately counts to save\r\nConstantinople from the Russians.\r\n\r\nMr. Imbrie, the American commercial attaché, has been entrusted with the\r\ndouble duty of protecting concession-hunters from the States and\r\norganising the “American Near East Relief Workers in Anatolia,”\r\nadministered in Angora by Mr. Compton and his charming wife, who must\r\nhave stepped out of the frame of a dainty miniature. Mr. Imbrie, by the\r\nway, lives in a railway _salon_, and when his wife arrives we hope that\r\nher rugs and cushions and curtains may be as pretty as Mrs. Compton’s.\r\n\r\nIt is very unfortunate that all relief work has been so wickedly\r\nhampered by friends of Armenia in the States. Their ridiculously unjust,\r\nanti-Turkish, propaganda must have been inspired by the American version\r\nof _Ally Sloper’s Half-Holiday_!\r\n\r\nMoreover, Americans never give relief which they cannot themselves\r\nadminister. Maybe the implied affront to Turkish competency is\r\nunintentional, but Kiazim Kara Békir Pasha (who looks after five hundred\r\norphans without a penny from the State, and has established many\r\n“professional” schools) has a right to resent it. His compatriots are\r\noften tempted to exclaim, “Keep your dollars,” for American charities\r\nare always administered with a business manner that scarcely conciliates\r\nthe recipient; and one must wonder, for example, how the Armenian priest\r\ncan provide for his flock of seventy on four hundred liras (3,000\r\nfrancs) a month. They do not evangelise with much tact, and Turkey can\r\nhardly be expected not to sense the Armenian behind the missionary.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, America has done a great deal for education, and one\r\nsincerely hopes that her colleges will keep out of propaganda. Every\r\nTurk will acknowledge the supreme value of the institutions that have\r\nproduced brilliant pupils like Halidé Edib Hanoum, and they will know\r\nvery well how much the women of Turkey can gain from them, _not_ to be\r\ngained from their own system of education. I admire Turkish women very\r\nmuch, and have enjoyed their company in their own homes, but I am none\r\nthe less ready to honour the work of their American teachers that has\r\nalready given them so splendid a start towards real progress and\r\ncomplete freedom.\r\n\r\nOne must not forget the Imperial Ottoman Bank, now destined, by decree\r\nof the Assembly, to become the Bank of Turkey. The fact will, I hope, be\r\nfreely advertised, so that all over Anatolia its origin may not be\r\nforgotten, whilst its increased power becomes well known, and the people\r\nmay learn to regard it as what the French call a real _Maison du bon\r\nDieu_.\r\n\r\nAlready to-day, even in remote places like Angora, you can “inquire\r\nwithin for everything” at its well-organised branches. Whether with or\r\nwithout directions from headquarters, the Bank of Angora is always ready\r\nto supplement one’s stores, and supply extra beds or special\r\ninformation, and any traveller in the heart of Asia Minor will know the\r\nvalue of such little courtesies! Of course, its financial backing of\r\nAnglo-French capital forms the surest possible passport for universal\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nWe may hope, too, that its official position in the State may soon have\r\nthe indirect result of diminishing our foolish jealousies of French\r\ninfluence. France asks, and deserves, some gratitude for her courage in\r\nadmitting the error of her ways at Sèvres, but she has no ambition to\r\nundermine British interests.\r\n\r\nTurkey needs capital, and American help involves interference from men\r\ntoo far away for understanding. Anglo-French capital, the more the\r\nbetter, means good terms in the East between us, and real friendship\r\ntowards Turkey, for “where their treasure is, there is the heart also.”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n    HALIDÉ EDIB HANOUM, AUTHOR AND PATRIOT—A WOMAN DOWERED WITH THE\r\n                ALL-CONQUERING GIFTS OF THE TRULY BRAVE\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERE can scarcely be a worse misinterpretation of the Turks to-day than\r\nthe common assumption that they do not value their women. As an example\r\nto prove this we turn to the charming writer and patriot, Halidé Edib\r\nHanoum. Not only well known for her work in England and America, she is\r\nrespected and honoured throughout the length and breadth of her own\r\ncountry, trusted with positions of responsibility, consulted and, above\r\nall, listened to, by those at the helm of affairs.\r\n\r\nAs one of their brilliant journalists once said in the ante-room of the\r\nAssembly: “We gave her a place in the army. She would have gone with the\r\ndelegates to Lausanne had her health permitted. She was elected a Member\r\nof the Assembly, and now we realise the Constitution does not yet admit\r\nwomen, we shall remove all such restrictions.”\r\n\r\nStrong evidence of eager homage to a brilliant woman emphatically\r\nexpressed! I had met this famous lady in the old days, when we were\r\nfriends with Turkey, and am naturally anxious to renew the acquaintance,\r\nif only to talk over the terrible happenings that have transformed her,\r\nalas! into one of the bitterest of England’s enemies. I am sure that,\r\nlike Mustapha Kemal, she will be rejoiced to come back to us when we\r\nboth change.\r\n\r\nHer little farmhouse, most charming of rustic homes, stands on a rough\r\nroad, at this time of year inches deep in mud, about an hour’s drive\r\nfrom Angora. A clear stream runs by the way, and all around is silent\r\nand calm, save for the very occasional noise of a passing carriage. In\r\nsummer, with the sun shining on the grazing cows, it would seem an ideal\r\nspot for this untiring worker.\r\n\r\nA voracious reader of the Continental Press, Halidé Hanoum has told me\r\nof her great amusement at the report that her flight into Anatolia had\r\nbeen “promoted by a desire to flee from harems and veils.” It is, of\r\ncourse, in Constantinople that the women have so largely cast off the\r\nold customs, whereas in far-away Anatolia most are still rigorously kept\r\nin seclusion. “People in Europe simply cannot grasp what our\r\ncivilisation means,” she said; “that is what makes it so difficult for\r\nus to come to an understanding.”\r\n\r\nShe and her husband, Dr. Adnan Bey, now Angora High Commissioner in\r\nConstantinople, would have been imprisoned with the other Nationalists\r\nthree years ago had they not managed to escape to these mountains. Clad\r\nin the picturesque costumes of the villagers, with clogs on their feet,\r\nand a few possessions crowded into a bullock-wagon, they made their way\r\nslowly into Angora, dependent for food and shelter upon the picturesque,\r\nbut uncomfortable, little inns on the way.\r\n\r\nSince the victory of the Nationalists, she is free, of course, to seek\r\nher equally picturesque home in the heart of Stamboul; but, “How I love\r\nmy Angora farmstead!” she cried, as her quaint peasant waiting-woman\r\nbrought in coffee and cigarettes. There was proof, at least, in the\r\ncountless books, papers and souvenirs from England around us that she\r\nhas not forgotten her education in the American College; and, whatever\r\nher judgment of us to-day, she speaks our language without a fault.\r\n\r\nAs the eye travels over the delicately-cut features of Halidé Hanoum,\r\nthe expression of sensitiveness stands out as the greatest charm of her\r\nbeauty. Yet the quiet reserved manner cannot hide the force of her mind\r\nand her compelling personality. Charm, intelligence, great talent and\r\ncourage, are all in her dower. What is it one admires the most? For me,\r\ncertainly, the all-conquering gift of the _truly brave_.\r\n\r\nAs my father used to say of General Gordon: “In the service of God and\r\nhumanity, he was the bravest of men; and in his sorest need or his\r\ngreatest loneliness, his courage rose all the time. To have known Gordon\r\nis to say with certainty, ‘God is courage!’”\r\n\r\nThis fragile and thoroughly feminine little lady was first in the field\r\nagainst Abdul Hamid, one of the first to understand Angora, to leave all\r\nfor the Pasha, to work without ceasing for Nationalism and the new\r\nTurkey. She tells me that a true account of the Greek atrocities, as\r\n_she_ saw them, will be an important feature of her memoirs, though I\r\nshall be, personally, more eager to read the story of her own courageous\r\nachievements.\r\n\r\nThere is only one of her judgments upon things as they are which I\r\nregret, and believe to be mistaken. Trained in an American college, and\r\nhonoured as she is all over the States, it is but natural that she\r\nshould blame England for leading America astray on the subject of\r\nChristian minorities. Here neither nation assuredly can plead not\r\nguilty; but the exaggeration and the fervour of the false appeal have\r\ncome, I honestly believe, from across the Atlantic, and not to them from\r\nus.\r\n\r\nHalidé’s first literary achievement, for which she was decorated by the\r\nSultan, was to translate “The Mother in the Home,” by an American\r\npedagogue of the sixties; just the kind of book one would expect an\r\nintelligent young girl to choose!\r\n\r\nI first met Halidé Hanoum just after she had succeeded in ending her\r\nfirst marriage. The union was not a happy one—she was then only\r\nseventeen—but it brought her two fine sons, who are naturally very proud\r\nof their mother. Education and training among American-taught students\r\nhad made it impossible for her to lead the old harem existence, but she\r\nwas able to give herself up to deep study, absorbing from her husband’s\r\nextensive library the many original ideas she is now giving to the\r\nworld. My friends have told me, and I can well believe, how much one\r\nloses of beauty in her exquisite style of writing from ignorance of the\r\nlanguage. One envies her the rare combination of a first-class Eastern\r\nand Western culture.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Abdul Hamid she was condemned to death, and her\r\n“Memoirs” will, one day, reveal to us the terrible suffering of those\r\nyears. Now, however, the pendulum has swung back, and she is reaping the\r\nreward of her courageous work for young Turkey by the high esteem and\r\nconsideration she universally receives. She was frequently consulted by\r\nthe late Talaat Pasha and the late Djémal Pasha, owing to her\r\nexceptional knowledge of Western institutions. It was at her house, too,\r\nI met the able and charming editor of the _Tanine_, Hussein Djahid,\r\nafterwards with us at Lausanne. All Turkey’s great men have visited her,\r\nand visit her still; and, without doubt, much of the destiny of her\r\ncountry has come to birth, if not maturity, in her home.\r\n\r\nUnder the shadow of renewed war, this citizen in the Great Republic of\r\nLetters could not refrain from the sad topics of Greek atrocities and\r\nLausanne, but soon turned our talk to more congenial thoughts.\r\n\r\nShe asked after John Masefield, and I told her that he had been a\r\nstretcher-bearer during the war, and recently I sent him a laurel leaf\r\nfrom Rome with an enclosed note: “Coming events cast their shadows\r\nbefore!”\r\n\r\nI believe in frankly telling an author how much one enjoys his work, and\r\nhave myself often appreciated the pleasures of such spontaneous\r\nflattery. Was I not myself grateful to receive from Australian mothers\r\nletters thanking me for “having written the truth about the Turks.”\r\nTheir sons were prisoners in Turkey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BROUSSA.\r\n  General view of this charming Asiatic city.\r\n  p. 256\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HALIDÉ HANOUM.\r\n  THE WELL-KNOWN WRITER, PATRIOT, AND FEMINIST LEADER.\r\n  She has ridden all over Anatolia, making official reports for the\r\n    Turkish Government concerning Greek atrocities.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  DR. ADNAN BEY.\r\n  HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR CONSTANTINOPLE.\r\n  Husband of Halidé Hanoum.\r\n  p. 208\r\n]\r\n\r\nSarojini Naidu, also a friend of Halidé Hanoum, sent me an exquisite\r\npoem during the world’s despair. As the words went perfectly to the tune\r\nof “Rose in the Bud,” I have sung them again and again for conquest in\r\nsorrow, and rejoiced in their magic power. To those yearning for higher\r\nthings, to whom words of faith bring comfort amidst the cold angles of\r\nlife, the little poem may have its message:\r\n\r\n            Nay, do not weep tho’ life be full of sadness;\r\n            Dawn will not veil her splendour for your grief,\r\n            Nor spring withhold that bright appointed beauty\r\n            From lily’s blossom or Ashaka leaf.\r\n\r\n            Nay, do not pine tho’ life be full of trouble;\r\n            Time will not pause nor tarry on his way.\r\n            To-day that seems so long, so strange, so bitter,\r\n            Will soon be some forgotten yesterday.\r\n\r\n            Nay, do not weep—new hopes—new dreams—new faces,\r\n            The unspent joy of all the unborn years,\r\n            Will prove your heart a traitor to its sorrow\r\n            And make your eyes unfaithful to their tears.\r\n                                              SAROJINI NAIDU.\r\n\r\nAfter the Constitution of 1918 had been proclaimed, “Freedom for Women”\r\nbecame one of the burning questions of the day. Here, Halidé Hanoum was\r\nalmost immediately the acknowledged leader, and has ever since been\r\nurging her sisters, with noble eloquence, to take the position so long\r\ndenied them in the life of the country. With her solid backing from\r\nTalaat and Djémal, Djavid and H. Djahid, she achieved wonders of\r\nawakening. In those old days I had myself contributed to some of the\r\nexcellent women’s papers, which were brought out for the discussion of\r\neducational and social problems, among which I regret to have seen no\r\nmore of that most promising sheet, the _Kadinlar Dunyassi_. At the\r\nrequest of the Department of Public Instruction, Halidé Hanoum drew up a\r\nprogramme of Education for Women and was herself appointed Chief\r\nInspector of Schools.\r\n\r\nBy the letter of the law at least, Turkish women are in a much better\r\nposition than women have yet secured among us—to the disgrace of Western\r\nliberty. They have always administered their own property, signed all\r\ndocuments relating to their own affairs, have the full privileges of a\r\nwitness in the courts, and are allowed to plead their own cases—we have\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nThey were, unfortunately, kept back socially during the retrograde\r\nrégime of the ruthless Hamid; but their fine work on the battle-fields\r\nof the Balkan wars, side by side in the ranks with their men, and their\r\nable organisation of the Red Crescent Society, carried them forward _a\r\nhundred years_.\r\n\r\nThere has been a certain amount of agitation for the abolition of the\r\nveil, but the tradition withstands reform, though it is now no more than\r\na sort of toque, or turban, such as we also frequently wear. However,\r\nHalidé Hanoum—most advanced of feminists—has never herself abandoned the\r\nveil, probably seeing in it a Nationalist, if not a religious, symbolic\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\nI wish I could reproduce at least some of the finest passages from some\r\nof her lectures. The noble spirit of her inspiration yet speaks, even to\r\nthose unable to follow her words. No one can marvel that she set her\r\nhearers on fire to save “all that remained of the Turkish\r\nEmpire—Anatolia.” As she has written, “It is the love of race which\r\nfirst made the Turks a mighty people. Whatever may come, rest assured\r\nour race cannot die. It hath immortal life. Though we stand alone\r\nagainst the world, our love of race will give us courage. Till we can\r\nonce more stand proudly beside the nations, we will fear no obstacle and\r\nshrink from no self-sacrifice!”\r\n\r\nShe gave to Mustapha Kemal Pasha, before his full powers were proven to\r\nall, the words found on the stone of an old Turkish Padishah:\r\n\r\n“God appointed me ruler, that the name and fame of the Turkish race\r\nmight not be extinguished. I was not appointed to rule over a rich, but\r\nover a poor, people, scantily supplied with food and clothing. For the\r\nTurkish race I slept not at night, I rested not by day, I worked for my\r\npeople till death.”\r\n\r\nHer work in Syria, interrupted, alas! by the war, has established her\r\nremarkable powers of organisation; and though she denies that she was\r\never actually in the Cabinet, no one can doubt that she would make a\r\nsplendid Minister of Education. The deputies themselves are so eager for\r\nher admission to the Assembly, that we may easily soon hear that the\r\ndepartment has been placed in her able hands.\r\n\r\nAt Beyrout she converted the big building of the Dames de Nazareth into\r\na fine school, where, faithful to her Western training, she gave special\r\nprominence to Swedish drill, and where, as in the American colleges,\r\nMoslem and Christian sit side by side. When the English advanced in\r\nSyria she handed over her schools, and her Armenian and Turkish orphans,\r\nto the Americans, with the womanly entreaty that they would “care for\r\nthem and, above all, make them good boys and girls.”\r\n\r\nThe Turkey of her dreams and ambitions stands for peace and territorial\r\nintegrity, for progress in education and equal rights to Moslems and\r\nChristians. She knows when peace comes that England, with no thoughts of\r\nintrusion, will yet be only too glad to help. England is generous and\r\nhospitable. Turkish students, in medicine and other faculties, have long\r\nbeen with us (at Bedford College and elsewhere), conquering all\r\ndifficulties of language, climate, and social customs, taking their\r\ndegrees, etc, beside British women. Our schools, our hospitals and clubs\r\nwill always welcome all who wish to come to us: as Halidé Hanoum knew\r\nwell, before I reminded her.\r\n\r\nDespite their limited heritage, often from mothers who cannot read or\r\nwrite, Turkish women are brilliant students. I well remember trying to\r\ninterest the public in a friend of mine who, after specialising in\r\nGynæcology at Dublin, secured a London M.D. But the paper which could\r\nnot find space for this interesting achievement gaily printed long\r\ncolumns of “Arabian Nights” nonsense about the strange ways of Turkey\r\nwhich belonged, in fact, to the period of the woad-stained ancient\r\nBritons. If the public really must have cheap romance, they would not\r\ncomplain of an approximately correct date!\r\n\r\nIt is fortunate, indeed, for Turkey that their leading feminist will\r\nwork for progress on sound lines, and is far too wise to see no farther\r\nfor women than a junior partnership with men.\r\n\r\nThere are, at present, but few feminine stars in the Turkish firmament.\r\nBut all are loyally united in one common cause—to gain their freedom and\r\nsave the Fatherland. It is too soon for us to indulge in prophecy on\r\nwhat their final self-organisation may achieve.\r\n\r\nHalidé Hanoum, like so many others, is trying to regain the health she\r\nspent so generously during the war. Attached to the army as a sergeant,\r\nshe followed the troops without a thought of danger and fatigue; and\r\nsince the recent hostilities she has ridden from town to town throughout\r\nAnatolia, collecting and arranging her report of the Greek destruction\r\nand atrocities. This report, controlled by experts and neutral\r\ncommissions, was sent to the Lausanne Conference. Halidé Hanoum’s\r\nexpression is sad. “How can I help loving my Anatolian home?” she said.\r\n“It has cost us such a terrible price in lives and suffering to save our\r\nland, we naturally would all die now rather than live in slavery again.\r\n\r\n“I am horrified to hear,” she went on, “that anyone can still attribute\r\nthe fire in Smyrna to the Turks. Why do they not accuse them, too, of\r\nburning Asia Minor? Will it always have to be so? Although the Greek\r\natrocities committed in our land are too horrible even to talk or write\r\nabout, excuses are always found for the Greeks, while anything done by\r\nthe Turks is grossly, unjustly exaggerated. If one Christian dies, the\r\nwhole Christian world is concerned, as it should be. But, on the other\r\nhand, when a whole community of Moslems is wiped out, no one cares....\r\nIt is this spirit of injustice that exasperates Moslems. Now, however,\r\nour recent victory gives us the right to demand equal consideration with\r\nEuropeans, no more, no less.” But, “speaking of Greek atrocities,” she\r\ncontinues, “the world has simply _got to know_ what they were during\r\nthis war. Dr. Nansen, of the League of Nations, is busy lecturing on the\r\nGreeks’ suffering, but what of the Turks’? All the terrible devastation\r\nto which you can testify, all the number of women and children burnt and\r\nviolated; the world must have these figures to pass judgment on the\r\nGreeks. This eternal and unjust fault-finding with the Turk not only\r\nbreaks his spirit (remember he is an Asiatic), but incites him to do\r\nthings he never otherwise would think of doing. It is a most dangerous\r\npolicy.”\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Conference, Halidé Hanoum seems to have lost her\r\nusual optimism. “Are we right to have faith?” she asked. “We all of us\r\nwelcomed a change in the British Government, and hoped that our\r\ninterests would be impartially discussed at Lausanne, but what is\r\nhappening?”\r\n\r\nThe two actions which Halidé Hanoum considers _most_ unjust to Turkey\r\nare the endeavours to exempt Christians from military service and the\r\nretention of the Greek Patriarch. “After the effort we have made to be\r\nfree, we must have our country to ourselves, and if the Greeks expect\r\nequal rights with the Moslems, they must fight for those citizen rights.\r\nAs to the Patriarch, imagine asking us to keep a man who had taken\r\nadvantage of his sacred calling to turn his flock against us.... Will\r\nthe Western Powers always interfere? All our history goes to prove that\r\nTurks and Christians have lived together in perfect harmony. When the\r\nPowers began to interfere, however, the Christians showed the basest\r\ningratitude. They invented the most wicked stories, knowing there was no\r\njustice for us, and that whatever they said would be believed. Now the\r\nPowers who turned the Christians against us cannot keep their promises.\r\nThe Christians want to come back to us. But we will have _no more_\r\ninterference.\r\n\r\n“If the Conference is only to be an excuse to wear the Turks out, why\r\nshould we wait, only to fight in the end? A policy of slow death is\r\nintolerable. We do not seek war, though we are ready to fight, because\r\nwe want to build up our country, take care of and educate our people,\r\nand give them a little of the comfort and happiness they deserve. Rather\r\nthan have an unjust vassal-peace,” she concluded, “let us perish\r\naltogether.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe picture of Halidé Hanoum confronts us on all sides throughout\r\nAnatolia. Among the heroes of the revolutions, the Turks reverence her\r\nas their Joan of Arc. No history of the Nationalist movement can ever be\r\nattempted or thought of without a full record of her courageous loyalty\r\nand untiring patriotism.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI was once asked to suggest the best way of helping forward the cause of\r\nwomen in Turkey. I naturally answered that I would give them England’s\r\n_best_: her social and nursing service, but, above all, her literature.\r\nM. Henri Taine wrote of us: “The English are a horrible race, but they\r\nhave done all there is to be done in literature.” It has always made me\r\nashamed to find so few English books in Turkish schools. Of course, at\r\npresent, our language is not widely known among these people; but, as\r\nthe nations of the world grow closer in thought and faith, one hopes\r\nthat they, too, may share the inspiration and moral uplifting so many\r\nhave found in our best classics.\r\n\r\nWe should surely endeavour to remove the reproach implied by the words\r\nof Professor E. J. Browne: “French influence has played too large a\r\npart, both in the political and literary field, in the evolution of New\r\nTurkey, and French ideas have too long dominated Turkish reformers.”\r\n\r\nThe life of Florence Nightingale and her precepts, our science and the\r\nwritings of George Eliot, these few names and ideas may serve to\r\nindicate the treasure we have for all men. Our literature is a gold\r\nmine, which I, for one, long to see given its full honour and\r\npre-eminence in the education and development of the women of Turkey.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n HOSPITALS—SCHOOLS—EDUCATION AND THE NATIONALIST WRITERS—THE DAYS PASS,\r\n              BUT THERE IS STILL MUCH TO BE DONE AND SEEN\r\n\r\n\r\nONE’S first impression of Angora would lead one to imagine that\r\neverything could be seen in a very short time; but the days pass, and\r\nthere is still much to be done. I have visited the Governor, and\r\ncongratulated him on the progress of the town’s development, which has\r\nadvanced steadily, even since my arrival. If there were only peace, one\r\ncould soon hope for completion.\r\n\r\nMy guide, Vely Nedjdat Bey, understands what will interest me most; and\r\nthe efforts of the Red Crescent, disclosed on our round of the\r\nhospitals, have given me a most agreeable surprise. The sanitation\r\nleaves much to be desired from our Western standards, but progressive\r\nTurks have now learnt the importance of such matters, and are determined\r\nto change their old ways, after the peace. It would be a formidable\r\nundertaking, at the moment impossible, to carry out the drastic\r\nalterations that are essential in these primitive buildings, with no\r\nmodern heating apparatus, and so few well-trained professional nurses.\r\nUnder such conditions they have done marvels with serum, and have\r\nactually kept down cholera, typhus, typhoid, and small-pox with\r\nextraordinary success. It is only unfortunate that they have adopted the\r\nFrench method of typhoid-inoculation right into the breast, which,\r\nthough often effective, is certainly dangerous for women.\r\n\r\nThe military hospital at Broussa—formerly the Splendid Hotel,\r\noverlooking a magnificent stretch of landscape—is excellently organised;\r\nand though asked for criticism by Dr. Nazoum, head of the Army Medical\r\nService, I could not think of any improvement to suggest.\r\n\r\nWe spent a morning at the Lycée for Girls, which was interesting, though\r\nI could not, of course, follow any of the classes in detail. Here,\r\nagain, one can obtain the most charming views of the town of Angora, and\r\nI told the headmistress how I longed to carry away their wonderful front\r\ndoor. She was, evidently, pleased by the sincerity of my compliment, and\r\nhad no fear lest I should follow the example of the Ambassador at\r\nConstantinople. His wife had so greatly admired a superb Byzantine\r\nfountain in our garden, that my host promptly gave orders for it to be\r\ndug up and sent to the Embassy, where it still remains!\r\n\r\nYoung as she seemed, the headmistress clearly recognised the\r\nresponsibilities of her position, which were—at once so hampered and so\r\nincreased—in a state of war. At many of the Lycées in Anatolia there was\r\na man as headmaster, his wife being the headmistress; during the war the\r\nmen, of course, had all gone! Education, after all, can do nothing if\r\nthere is no Fatherland—no one to educate!\r\n\r\nOne class was being instructed by a hodja on the meaning of their\r\nprayers and the general principles of the Faith; and I also heard\r\nclasses in history and geography, literature and hygiene. I was told\r\nthat, in hygiene, the subject that morning was the evils of alcohol as a\r\nbeverage. They were taught, however, in what ways alcohol _can_ be used\r\nactually to benefit mankind. All honour to those who teach their\r\nchildren, from the first, the terrible curse of drink!\r\n\r\nThe girls recited patriotic poems for my benefit which sounded very\r\nbeautiful to the foreign ear. It is, I suppose, the sequence of even and\r\nuneven syllables which produce this musical effect. They were taught,\r\napparently, in all subjects to stand up and answer questions in a short\r\nspeech: surely an admirable training, likely to ensure their knowing how\r\nto use the language in writing and speaking with far more correctness,\r\nelegance, and effect than most of our young people ever attempt.\r\n\r\nI peeped into the dormitories, which, like the class-rooms, seemed in\r\nexcellent order. Coffee and tea were laid out for us in the\r\nrecreation-room; and before we left the head-girl expressed their\r\npleasure and thanks in what was—evidently—a neat and charming little\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nI felt, however, that, like the headmistress of Broussa College, my\r\nhostess no doubt regretted that there were now neither Greeks nor\r\nArmenians at the school. There had been no more difficulty in the\r\nclass-rooms than elsewhere through life, as to maintaining perfect\r\nharmony between Moslem and Christian. I was told that, though the latter\r\nwere generally supposed to be the cleverer, Turkish girls were, in a\r\nway, more keen and quick to learn. They had, at any rate, a quite\r\nfriendly desire not to be beaten, and now they miss the valuable\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\nIn olden days, though women even attained to fame in politics and\r\nliterature, the general standard for education was elementary, and no\r\npublic provision for it had been made.\r\n\r\nPrimary schools were started about sixty years ago; secondary and\r\nprofessional schools soon followed. There are now girls’ schools\r\nwherever one for boys has been established; in most towns also a Lycée\r\nfor Girls, and Normal Colleges in many counties of Asia Minor. There is\r\na Training College at Constantinople, from which the senior students\r\nalso attend lectures at the Women’s University, which shares\r\nlaboratories and lectures—in science and medicine—with the University\r\nfor men. I suspect, sometimes, Mustapha Kemal Pasha may introduce\r\nco-education throughout!\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo much interesting literature has been produced by the Nationalist\r\nmovement, that one must hope Professor E. G. Browne may, one day, pursue\r\nhis splendid defence of Turkey by giving us extensive extracts from\r\nthese writers in English. The greatest of all our living scholars in\r\nTurkish, Persian, and Arabic, he has devoted his whole life to the\r\nfascinating subject; and Prince Samad Khan has told me that he lectures\r\nin Persian without the trace of an accent.\r\n\r\nGraciously writing a Preface to my “Englishwoman in a Turkish Harem,” he\r\nsaid that as “a friend and admirer of the Turks, as well as a student of\r\ntheir language and literature, it is always a satisfaction to me to find\r\na fresh opportunity of testifying to my belief in the virtues of this\r\nmuch-maligned and ill-used race.”\r\n\r\nRecent events, however, seem to have paralysed his enthusiasm, bringing\r\ndepression that killed his zeal for the task he now felt it would be of\r\nno avail to pursue.\r\n\r\nThe Nationalist victory, let us hope, will encourage him to resume work\r\nwith a revived, and ever greater, enthusiasm. I had intended, indeed, to\r\nask him for a summary of the “Nationalist Literary Revival,” by way of a\r\nchapter in this book. But there was not time to presume so far on the\r\nkindness he has never refused to show.\r\n\r\nI have, therefore, reproduced, to the best of my ability, a few notes\r\nput together for me by that distinguished Professor, Hussein Raghib Bey,\r\nformerly Director of the Angora Press, and now Charge d’Affaires at the\r\nParis Embassy. He is an exceptionally well-informed critic in the\r\neducation, literature and politics of his own country, which travel also\r\nenables him to compare with the educational systems of Europe. He told\r\nme that, while he admired the thoroughness of German methods, he could\r\nnot tolerate their unjust administration of corporal punishment, which,\r\nin his judgment, vitiated the whole system. Turkish schools have all\r\nadopted French methods; and, myself a proud pupil of the École Normale\r\nSupérieure de Sèvres, I do not believe there is any finer instruction in\r\nthe world. But in the fullest sense of real and complete education, the\r\nbest work is being done in England. The ideal would seem to be a\r\ncombination of the two.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHussein Raghib took me right back to the “Divans,” a collection, or\r\nportfolio, of more or less national poems, celebrating the virtues of\r\nGod and the Prophet. Love-poetry does not begin before Fouzouli, in the\r\nreign of Suliman the Magnificent. Any ghazals (_i.e._, love songs) that\r\nI have heard sung here do not seem to express our conception of love.\r\nThe music sounds more tender and mournful than passionate, and the song\r\nitself is often addressed to the Unknown, to Love in the Abstract, and\r\nnot to the individual Beloved. Again and again I caught the word “pity,”\r\nsuggesting ideas and moods we should not expect to find.\r\n\r\nAfter the “Divans,” we notice the strong influence of Persian literature\r\nin Turkey, even the introduction of Persian words—a consequence, no\r\ndoubt, of wars in Persia and Arabia. Moreover, the Koran was then a\r\npredominating influence in all literature, as well as in science; and\r\nArabic was the language of religion.\r\n\r\nIt was Selim, to whom the King of Egypt handed over the Holy Relics—the\r\nstandard, the coat, and the wooden sculptured shoes—with the solemn\r\ninjunction, “They are yours—to hold; for you are qualified to be\r\nKhalife.” From that day and for ever, any Khalife who shall desert his\r\nguardianship of the Relics is, by that sin, self-deposed. And Great\r\nBritain, the largest Moslem Power in the whole world, revealed her\r\nignorance, or her indifference, by calling Wahid-Eddin, “The Khalife,”\r\nlong after his escape to Malta!\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe see, then, that in the days of Sultan Mahmoud (that is, in our\r\neighteenth century), the Turkish language was largely composed of Arabic\r\nand Persian, through the influence of religion. Then, precisely as our\r\npeople in the old days could not read or speak the scholar’s Latin of\r\nour great literature, the people of Turkey could not understand their\r\nown writers.\r\n\r\nIt was about 1339 (in our nineteenth century) that the cultured and\r\nintelligent Schinassi Effendi was sent to France. As other scholars and\r\nmen of letters began to study Western culture in England, in her turn,\r\nTurkey was following European progress, towards desertion of any\r\nscholastic influences and academic style. Windows, that looked\r\nWestwards, were opening at last, to religion and literature alike.\r\n\r\nSchinassi Effendi was inspired by a fine, broad-minded enthusiasm. He\r\nsecured introductions to Lamartine and other great French writers; and,\r\nwhen he returned to Constantinople, immediately set to work upon a\r\ncomplete revolution of style and outlook in Turkish literature. With an\r\nideal of most admirable and direct simplicity, he succeeded in modelling\r\nthe language upon the best French, clear and logical way of\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most distinguished of his pupils were Namik Kemal Bey and\r\nAdbul Hak-Hamid; but there were many who helped to extend, and\r\nestablish, his literary revolution. They did not, of course, cut away\r\nthe whole traditional influence of the Arabs and the Persians; but, with\r\norderly methods that were Western, produced almost a new Turkish\r\nlanguage (which their own people could read and appreciate) that was\r\nperfectly adapted for the artistic and imaginative expression of modern\r\nthought and contemporary life. The European style and intellect, in its\r\npurely native setting, was, naturally, most apparent in their fiction.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNamik Kemal Bey was among those who died in exile for their ideals,\r\nleaving behind him some most touching pages in honour of the English\r\ncharacter and constitution. When Zeyneb came to England she read some of\r\nhis work to me, just at the time when some of our Liberal statesmen, to\r\ntheir eternal shame, had begun to declare their admiration for the\r\nRussia of the Czars. We arranged open-air meetings outside Sloane Square\r\nStation and at a big Opera House—to protest against the British M.P.’s\r\nvisit to Russia. Zeyneb’s comment was simple: “What would our great\r\nKemal say?” Constitutional England allied to Czarist Russia!\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe acknowledged leader of the New literature was Abdul Hak-Hamid, for\r\nsome time a member of the Turkish Embassy in London. Schinassi and Kemal\r\nstood half-way between the past and this great modern writer,\r\nrepresenting, also, patriotism in literature, as it dominated prose, at\r\nthe declaration of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nAt this time, of course, “patriotism” meant “the Revolution of 1908,” a\r\nunited attack on the tyranny of Abdul Hamid, who had persecuted Turks,\r\nGreeks, and Armenians alike.\r\n\r\nOnce the Constitution had been proclaimed, however, the Armenians turned\r\nto Russia for help to establish their own independence; the Greeks\r\nsought to revive an “Empire” from Athens.\r\n\r\nThe Turks, who had never hesitated to appoint a Greek or an Armenian\r\namong their Viziers and Foreign Ministers, who always sent Christian\r\nAmbassadors to England, and who had chosen the Armenian, Gabriel Effendi\r\nNouradunghian, for their Minister of Foreign Affairs, were now driven to\r\nconcentrate their betrayed enthusiasm upon building up a Turkish nation\r\n_of their own_—for themselves alone.\r\n\r\nTheir scholars, therefore, devoted themselves to scientific research;\r\nsocial institutions were founded; they studied philosophy, national\r\neconomy, and sociology; they prepared their own ethnography, history,\r\nand geography, and the reformed Turkish language.\r\n\r\nThey had, as it were, to build up a complete learning; almost a\r\nuniversal knowledge; a true world-culture for Eastern peoples; that, by\r\nits “National” inspiration, should create for Turkey a spirit and a\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nThat great _savant_, Zia Gueuk Alp, one of the Malta victims, and\r\nafterwards Professor of Sociology at Constantinople, has done more for\r\nthe New literature than any other one writer; as Mehmet Emin Bey, who\r\nlives at Adalia, is their leading poet. They have others, of course, who\r\nproduced fine work; among whom Yahia Kemal would probably prove the\r\noutstanding genius, had he the energy to maintain his highest gifts. The\r\npangs of a Nation’s Birth, out of Sacrifice, have found voice.\r\n\r\nThere are two women of genius in this group. To Halidé Hanoum we have\r\nalready devoted a chapter, in honour of a wise and passionate\r\npersonality that has impressed itself on the whole history of a\r\ngeneration. We in England, I hope, are shortly to have a translation of\r\nher remarkable “Nouveau Touran.”\r\n\r\nMufidé Hanoum (Mme. Ferid Bey) also approaches, though she has not\r\nreached, the outstanding genius of Halidé Hanoum. She is a younger\r\nwoman, a less experienced writer, and, maybe, she lacks the inspiration\r\nthat comes from long strain and suffering.\r\n\r\n“There are others,” concluded Hussein Raghib, “whom you _ought_ to know,\r\nthough they are not equally great.”\r\n\r\n“But I’ve stayed too long already,” I replied, “interrupting your work.”\r\n\r\nAnd busy men, even in the East, must not neglect the State for\r\ncourtesies too prolonged.\r\n\r\nHussein Raghib himself has published a very delightful “Story of\r\nNationalism,” dating from the Closing of the Turkish Parliament. “As a\r\nmatter of fact,” he writes, “the _Turc Odjagui_ was the beginning of\r\nNationalism.” This was a club founded by Hamdoullah Soubhi Bey as a\r\nprotest against “Union and Progress,” and to place the movement on a\r\nnational, as opposed to a party, basis. Halidé Hanoum and other\r\nprominent women were admitted; and its three thousand members included\r\nprofessional men like officers, lawyers, doctors, professors and\r\nwriters; and men of all nationalities—Greeks and Armenians, Persians and\r\nArabs. It was closed by the English, but has recently been re-assembled.\r\n\r\nMustapha Kemal Pasha contributed handsomely to the funds, and Hamdoullah\r\nSoubhi came from Angora for the re-opening. “As our territory has become\r\nsmaller, our intellectual empire must become wider,” said Hussein\r\nRaghib. “That is the spirit behind the club.” I had, unfortunately, to\r\nleave for Lausanne before the opening ceremony.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have just been to the famous Hadgi Bairam Mosque, and found its chief\r\ncharm, as I expected, in the exquisite colouring of the carpets and\r\nantique faïences. These glowing scarlets and blues, mauves and\r\nterra-cottas, surely compensate, in some measure, for all the grey that\r\novershadows life. Europe would not seem so sordid if we imported more\r\nbright colours from the East—for our _East_ Ends! Nothing fascinates me\r\nso much as the atmosphere of a mosque; the un-selfconsciousness and\r\nnatural reverence of the men at prayers; out of the world, in Allah’s\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nSurely faith is the same for all men, making all men equal!\r\n\r\n“The gods,” said my guide, “are three—Goodness, Beauty, and Truth.”\r\n\r\n“To which I would add Courage,” was my response.\r\n\r\n“As you please,” he answered.\r\n\r\nHe told me that “The Pasha” and the first Deputies all came to visit the\r\nMosque before the opening of the Grand National Assembly, joined by\r\neveryone in Angora—even sceptics—“to lift our hands to Heaven in prayer,\r\nconfident that victory must be ours.”\r\n\r\nWe went on to the tomb of the Sainted Man, robed in shawl and turban,\r\nafter the picturesque Eastern manner. The guardian of the tomb was\r\nseated before it on his crossed legs, reading the Koran; and around him\r\nwere many women, weeping over their prayers.... “Is it for peace, or for\r\ntheir dead?” I wondered!\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat afternoon I determined to try and find out all I could about the\r\narmy from some of my friends at the Assembly.\r\n\r\n“You are very indiscreet,” said the officer, whose attention I had\r\nmanaged to secure.\r\n\r\n“I know that,” was my reply; “it is a little like asking St. Peter for\r\njust a peep into Heaven. But you _can_ tell me something?”\r\n\r\n“What do you wish to know? Our normal military service is for three\r\nyears. We naturally have to adopt conscription for an indefinite period\r\nin times of war.”\r\n\r\n“What was the meaning of the large crowd at the Town Hall to-day?”\r\n\r\n“They were enlisting. We cannot let go now. The sovereign rights of the\r\npeople must be maintained.”\r\n\r\n“You were beaten to the dust in the Great War,” I suggested.\r\n\r\n“We _were_ defeated in Palestine. But most of our troops went to\r\nCilicia; we were victorious in the Dardanelles and the Caucasus. Few of\r\nthe Powers were forced to scatter their forces along so many frontiers.\r\n\r\n“The English were nowhere near Mosul,” he went on, “and they never\r\nreally broke up our army; they just took possession of Constantinople\r\nand, through the Greeks, of Smyrna. They taught us the _fait accompli_.\r\n\r\n“It was necessary for us, of course, after the rupture with\r\nConstantinople, to reorganise the whole army. The Pasha was forced to\r\ncall in officers to train companies, even irregulars. Ali Fuad commanded\r\nin the North; Refet Pasha in the South. At the first battle we had two\r\nbig guns only!\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  AGHA AGLOU AHMED BEY.\r\n  DIRECTOR OF THE ANGORA PRESS.\r\n  He sent a charming message to the author of this book complimenting\r\n    her on her courage.\r\n  p. 224\r\n]\r\n\r\n“The work went on day and night: collecting and training men, making or\r\nrepairing arms and munitions, gathering metal—often from railway lines.\r\nNo one thought of rest till all was ready in numbers and construction.\r\nWe had ten thousand men in July, 1920, we are four hundred thousand\r\nto-day! We obtained four hundred and fifty big guns, and a fleet of\r\naeroplanes from the Greeks; a thousand machine-guns, besides clothing,\r\ntents, horses and mules, from the English.\r\n\r\n“Now we have no grounds for fear, though you in England will not attempt\r\nto realise our Mosul figures: _Turks_, 150,000; _Kurds_, 450,000;\r\n_Arabs_, 30,000; _Nestorians_, 30,000. The _Kurds_ wish to unite with\r\nus. The _Nestorians_ will fight, either as independent allies or under\r\nTurkish officers.”\r\n\r\n“Colonel Mougin says that your army is the best officered in the world,”\r\nI said.\r\n\r\n“Our Staff is composed of picked men with great experience and\r\nknowledge; the officers have been chosen with great care. We are young,\r\nenergetic, well-trained, and, above all, fired with enthusiasm for the\r\ncause.\r\n\r\n“There is no calling more honoured than that of the army. None may marry\r\nwithout the consent of his superior officer.”\r\n\r\n“Can he marry a Christian?” I asked.\r\n\r\nHe hesitated a moment, and then replied: “It isn’t done.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” I smiled, “you have stolen our English _credo_.”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n  LAST DAYS IN ANGORA: EXCURSIONS, CONVERSATIONS, PICNICS—HAÏDAR BEY’S\r\n                                 PARTY\r\n\r\n\r\nANGORA, certainly, carries one back to the centuries before Christ;\r\nalthough we now realise that life was by no means without its luxury in\r\nthose bygone days. As the houses of Pompeii were warmed by hot air\r\nbehind the walls, and the baths were not only hygienic but luxurious, it\r\nwould puzzle one to find what now remains in Angora from the comfortable\r\nperiod of Augustus. There is also a prehistoric atmosphere about Smyrna,\r\nor as it was once wittily expressed: “Since its deliverance from Greeks\r\nand Armenians, it has the charm of Sodom and Gomorrah after the fire.”\r\n\r\nBut every day I am more at a loss to imagine where the thirty thousand\r\ninhabitants of Angora are living to-day. I have seen some of them in\r\ntheir charmingly improvised houses, made homelike by the marvellous\r\ncarpets of the East; but, as one always goes back to one’s first love, I\r\ngive up the problem, and return to talk with the “élite” at the\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\nOne day I found the Director of the Angora Press, Aga Aglou Ahmed Bey,\r\nin his tasteful little ante-room, and learnt that he, too, found it hard\r\nto forgive the recent policy of Great Britain. He repeated, also, the\r\nnote of despair I hear so often: “Whatever we do is wrong.”\r\n\r\n“Yet,” he added, “had our movement originated in America, we should have\r\nhad the whole world at our feet. All growing nations have been allowed\r\nto separate Church and State. We have, indeed, troubles within and\r\nwithout, but they have only strengthened the spirit of Nationalism,\r\nwhich the Pasha himself could not now destroy.\r\n\r\n“Alas, poor Turkey! Abdul Hamid disposed of Turks with amazing\r\ndexterity: he lost them, killed them, or forgot them; and who cared?\r\nThey were not Christians!\r\n\r\n“Look what it cost us to depose the ‘Red’ Sultan, and then we had the\r\n‘Black’ Sultan. When we got rid of him, Europe was not pleased. See how\r\nthe English are defending him; though one of your charming countrymen\r\ntold me they would not give him ‘house-room’ in your own country.”\r\n\r\nI suggested, and Halidé Hanoum agreed, we could not refuse to find a\r\nsafe home for our vassal; although, certainly, his visit to Mecca could\r\nnot be justified by our refusal to go on paying his board in Malta.\r\n\r\nAhmed Bey expressed his enthusiasm for Lord Curzon’s books on the East.\r\nAs a young student, he told me, he had written glowing appreciations of\r\nthis brilliant statesman, in whom all the Moslems had once put their\r\ntrust. From Malta, he wrote to Lord Curzon: “One of your greatest\r\nadmirers, who has often expressed his eulogies in public, is now in\r\nprison, a prisoner of peace, taken out of his bed....”\r\n\r\nThe names of Calthorpe and Milne will go down through the history of\r\nTurkey; but not to the credit of England.\r\n\r\nHere is the charming message sent to me by Aga Aglou Ahmed Bey, Director\r\nof the Press of Angora:—\r\n\r\n“I am, indeed, sorry that illness prevents my coming to tell you\r\npersonally what your visit means to us, and the feelings of gratitude\r\nand respect that you inspire in the hearts of all the Turks by your\r\n_courage_ and _love of the truth_....”\r\n\r\nI was particularly glad to hear that although, like most of his\r\ncompatriots, Ahmed Bey holds that all propaganda is foreign to the\r\ncharacter of the Turks, he has determined to open a “Bureau of\r\nInformation” as soon as Peace is signed. I cannot doubt that this will\r\nbe a great benefit to all Islam.\r\n\r\n“_My_ propaganda,” I told him, “would be inspired by the determination\r\nto blazon abroad the marvellous kindness of all your race. Few people\r\nhave any idea how hospitable and generous the Turks have been.”\r\n\r\n“Dear Mademoiselle,” he replied, “you are right. We have not the\r\nsky-scrapers of New York; but we have big hearts. Yet we have given you\r\nso little comfort....”\r\n\r\n“You have given me your best, and I appreciate it. Hygiene and luxury\r\nare not everything; though I have a pet theory of my own as to the\r\nholding of hands between East and West in the realm of hygiene: ‘First,\r\nI wash myself _à la West_, or, as you call it, in dirty water; then I\r\nperfect the ceremony _à la East_, that is, in running water. On the\r\nother hand, for a bath, I like to start with the Turkish and end with\r\nthe English. You see I am already half-Oriental.’”\r\n\r\nThough rather exceptionally sympathetic and broad-minded, I gathered\r\nfrom the Director that he, and others, were not quite so enthusiastic\r\nabout the French, as they, certainly, had been quite recently. Much was\r\nexpected of France at Lausanne, and they were disappointed in\r\nproportion.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Athenaeum_ published a strange comment on my last book about\r\nTurkey, from a writer who claimed to know the East: “When a race becomes\r\ndisciplined and energetic, the number of blonde women becomes greater!”\r\nI should not myself call many Turkish men I met blonde; but I have a\r\ncertain impression of noticing a number of surprisingly fair men in\r\nAngora; and, maybe, the energy of the Nationalists is thus evidenced in\r\nthe lighter colouring of their hair. If there be even a grain of truth\r\nin the theory, it seems a pity that women of all nations should resort\r\nto peroxide and henna, when a little hard work would have a better, and\r\nmore lasting, effect.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo-day, one feels the Grand National Assembly has achieved success, and\r\nis permanently established. This sense of security is, no doubt, partly\r\nderived from remembering what earlier parliaments, with scarcely less\r\nloyal enthusiasm, attempted, and failed to achieve. I remember my first\r\nvisit to Adbul Hamid’s Parliament, and the big hopes by which we were\r\nall then inspired. It had been no easy matter to overthrow that hideous\r\ntyrant, and we have no reason to blame that Government for not realising\r\nour full expectations. Other governments in other countries have failed\r\nagain and again on their road to ultimate success. On that opening day,\r\ntoo, I remember seeing, with pity and respect, a pale and lonely figure,\r\nseated silent among the general rejoicings, unnoticed and forgotten. It\r\nwas the son of the great Midhat, who had established a still earlier\r\nparliament. All honour to the pioneers.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn another occasion Djellal Noury Bey, deputy for Gallipoli and editor\r\nof the Constantinople _Illeri_ (or “Forwards”), gave me some further\r\nimpressions of the “Pasha” and of many interesting Anatolian problems.\r\nHowever closely the leaders agree on general principles, it is always\r\nhelpful to compare as many individual points of view as one can obtain.\r\nDjellal Noury has been to England and the States, and speaks perfect\r\nEnglish and French. We have mutual friends in London.\r\n\r\nI asked whether I might go over the National Pact with him, clause by\r\nclause; as although, or rather because, I am so keen a friend to\r\nNationalism, I want to be _sure_ whether there are any points in their\r\nscheme, or their aims and attitude, that I _do_ find fault with, or\r\nshould like to criticise.\r\n\r\nHe seemed only too delighted that anyone should care so much for a full\r\ndiscussion of their important work, and put everything before me as\r\nclearly and thoroughly as I could possibly wish.\r\n\r\nBut I could find nothing unreasonable in a single clause, if the Turkish\r\nnation is to achieve _real_ nationality.\r\n\r\nAs business men, for example, can the foreigners justly wish to maintain\r\nexemption from taxes? As Djellal Noury explained it: “The European and\r\nthe Turk buy goods, say at five francs. The European pays no taxes and\r\ncan sell for six francs. As the Turk pays a tax, he has to charge seven\r\nfrancs, and, being cut out in price, is naturally left with a large\r\nstock in hand. These are conditions which, obviously, cannot be\r\nmaintained. Capitulations have strangled the commerce of the country and\r\nits progress.\r\n\r\n“It may happen that one Power takes out a Concession for the railways,\r\nbut cannot, or will not, fulfil ifs contract. We have to go without\r\nrailways. We cannot go elsewhere when a Concession has been granted.”\r\n\r\nI complimented Djellal Noury upon the excellence of his French. “I used\r\nto edit a French paper,” he replied, as he looked round the ante-room in\r\nsearch of anyone to whom I might especially like to be introduced. For\r\nmy part, my attention had just been caught by one of the hodjas.\r\n\r\n“These people do not think as we do,” he said, catching the direction of\r\nmy glance.\r\n\r\n“Then you are anti-Islam?”\r\n\r\n“Not at all; I am strongly _pro_-Islam. The broad-minded dogmas of our\r\nreligion can meet all modern requirements, moral or spiritual. But the\r\nKoran is not properly interpreted by the hodjas. The will of the people\r\nis our religion; service is worship!”\r\n\r\nI remember a story of Mahomet I heard in Turkey. “The prophet was one\r\nday walking with his disciples, and passed a group of workmen on the\r\nriver’s bank who did not stop their task, even to salute him. When his\r\ndisciples inquired whether these men should not be called to order, he\r\nreplied: ‘Work and service are the greatest homage that the faithful can\r\npay to their prophet.’”\r\n\r\nI had already conceived the idea that Nationalism is a religion. One\r\nsees the National Pact beside the bedside, as we have our prayer-books.\r\nColonel Tewfik has a copy, bound like a small almanac, in his waistcoat\r\npocket. The principles of Angora are their “Holy Gospel.” To be a\r\nNationalist is to stand for your country’s most vital interests.\r\n\r\nWe spoke of the Press—Turkish as well as British. The whole Turkish\r\nPress stands for Nationalism, irrespective of any opposed local opinions\r\nor interests. With us, the fine independence of other days has\r\ndeparted—one hopes not for ever. In the hands of a few party-peers one\r\ncould, perhaps, expect nothing better. Were it not anti-Islam, one would\r\nname the _Manchester Guardian_ as the most honest newspaper to-day.\r\n\r\nDjellal Noury had given up so many afternoons to explaining to me the\r\nwhole policy of Nationalism, that I was grieved to hear of his having\r\ncalled to see me one afternoon when a party had been arranged for me by\r\nthe colonel to join one of their shooting expeditions. I wish he could\r\nhave been persuaded to join us.\r\n\r\nA special carriage and two of the finest horses in Angora had been\r\nrequisitioned for the occasion; and though the colonel was prevented, at\r\nthe last moment, from being with us, we made up four guns, and every man\r\nhad two rows of cartridges round his waist.\r\n\r\nI had visions of our coming Sunday lunch; but, alas! it was bitterly\r\ncold (in spite of rugs and shawls) on these lovely and picturesque\r\nroads, white with frost; and when we had waited a whole afternoon for\r\nthe shooters to shoot, someone at last bagged a magpie.\r\n\r\nPassing a flock of geese, by which the old woman of a tiny roadside farm\r\nwas standing sentinel, I asked one of the party to hand me a gun with\r\nwhich to shoot one of the geese by mistake. I remembered in time,\r\nhowever, that the only time I had ever aimed at a rabbit, I killed a\r\nfox; and I was afraid that by aiming at the goose I should probably\r\nshoot the lady.\r\n\r\nSo they toiled on for another hour with no better result, and we began\r\nto hesitate about facing the colonel and the director of the Ottoman\r\nBank, where we had all been invited to Sunday lunch. But on the way back\r\nwe were lucky enough to buy a fine, plump hare from two peasant women we\r\npassed on the road; and the colonel was boldly informed that it had\r\nfallen to Osman Noury. “Madame Noury must cook him,” cried the colonel,\r\nwith a laugh that struck one as rather suspicious. The colonel supplied\r\nchampagne; Mme. Noury superintended the hare and the pilaw; Boghetti\r\nbrought some fruit; Oeillet was responsible for the cigarettes.\r\n\r\nWhen behold, to the manifest discomfort of Osman Noury, the colonel\r\nbegan asking awkward questions about the “where’s and when’s.” “Be\r\ncareful,” I said, “the colonel is going to wire to his Government about\r\nit.” When the laughter subsided, Osman Noury blushingly explained that\r\nit had cost him two Turkish pounds! I am sure neither the fact nor the\r\nconfession diminished our enjoyment of the merry feast.\r\n\r\nI have been very ill to-day, on the point of slipping out of this world\r\naltogether. Not realising the danger of close proximity to a mangal, I\r\ncarried the precious warmth into my bedroom, to feast on its exquisite\r\npurple flames, which I just remember comparing to a sunset. Fortunately,\r\nmy faithful maid was in the room when I lost consciousness, and I was\r\ncarried out of the poisonous air.\r\n\r\nThe colonel told me afterwards that before they knew whether I should\r\nrecover, he was possessed of a horrible panic that he could never\r\npersuade his Government I had died by accident.... Everyone will say\r\n“the Turks poisoned you and the Frenchman let them do it.” Well, I am\r\nstill here, and the papers have lost an excellent opportunity for lying\r\ncopy. M. Louis Steeg declares: “You surely will never die!”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Pasha has graciously lent me his car for a visit to Halidé Hanoum.\r\nIt is a pretty little machine, lined with blue velvet, which hops and\r\nbumps and plunges along the roads like a kangaroo, swimming across the\r\nriver for more miles of twisting acrobatics. I have always admired the\r\ncarriage-drivers: before (or rather behind) M. Kemal’s chauffeur I am\r\ndumb. But, apparently, the cars “don’t mind”!\r\n\r\nI was imprudent enough to dismiss my conductor at the nearest point to\r\nmy host’s house, which even he could not reach, and walked on to find\r\nthe servants had all disappeared, no doubt to the Mosque, and the family\r\nwere not at home! Being in Turkey I did not hesitate to step down the\r\nroad and knock at the first door I came to, which was of plain deal,\r\nwith the usual huge lock (quite a foot long) and picturesque knocker. A\r\nthin-faced woman appeared to welcome me, and, without thinking, I fell\r\nback on my stock greeting: “Mustapha Kemal Pasha, _Chok Guzel_!”\r\nAccepting my muddy boots without demur, she smilingly led me into her\r\nlittle two-roomed cabin: on one side, the sleeping-room with its bed and\r\nwell-cushioned divan; on the other, her simple kitchen. When she had\r\ntucked me up on the Divan, and given me coffee and cigarettes, I did my\r\nbest at conversation, and by friendly signs tried to convey my\r\ngratitude. “England is a big country ... M. Kemal’s victory splendid ...\r\ncold weather outside,” my eyes and hands said.\r\n\r\nIf she did not exactly understand what was in my mind, she was polite\r\nenough to seem thoroughly interested. I sat on till I could hear the\r\nservants arriving at my host’s house, and with another supply of coffee,\r\nshe smiled me farewell, without the slightest appearance of having\r\nresented my lengthy intrusion. They are hospitable in Anatolia!\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother person I met with pleasure at the Assembly was Hamdoullah Soubhi\r\nBey. He is a distinguished writer and orator of about thirty-five, whose\r\nwhite hair offers a striking contrast to the alert youthfulness of his\r\nface and expression. He has spoken “cultured” French from the cradle;\r\nas, indeed, so many women of the upper classes know that language far\r\nbetter than Turkish. Zeyneb uses French in writing to Halidé Hanoum,\r\nbeing, no doubt, unwilling to trust her Turkish to so brilliant a\r\nwriter.\r\n\r\nIt must have been Hamdoullah Soubhi whom I heard, about ten years ago,\r\nplead so eloquently for the abolition of the harem. When he showed us\r\nwhat polygamy so often _meant_ to the children, few of his large\r\naudience could keep back their tears. The colonel had introduced him,\r\nand said that he had been the Minister of Education. “Why did he give up\r\nthe post?” I asked. “Ah, _pourquoi_!” shrugged my friend, “it is a\r\ndelight to talk with him. You, who love French, will indeed enjoy the\r\nexquisite language in which he clothes his thoughtful opinions. Such men\r\nare an ornament to any parliament.”\r\n\r\nHamdoullah Soubhi does not seem to feel so leniently towards the Greeks\r\nas M. Kemal, and is less optimistic about their return. It had been\r\nsupposed, he told me, that the marked differences between the two races\r\nwould balance each other; but it has not proved so, and, in his\r\njudgment, they would always clash. “Our Anatolians, so long neglected\r\nand forgotten, are as they were three thousand years ago: honourable,\r\nfirmly resisting all tempest, faithful to the traditions of their race,\r\nloyal to their chosen leader in the hour of danger.”\r\n\r\nI told him it should be a lesson for us in Europe, to find a map of Asia\r\nMinor in all the humble homes; while my host, the Minister of Public\r\nWorks, always brings _his_ map on to our breakfast table, to familiarise\r\nme with all the geography of these wide lands. We are now studying\r\nDiarbékir and Kurdistan, not only the wonderful old towns, but the\r\ncharacter of their cultured inhabitants. No wonder our Lausanne\r\ndelegates have so affronted Turkey by their lofty allusions to the\r\n“illiterate” Kurd!\r\n\r\n“How can our younger civilisations, however advanced in science and\r\ncommerce, ever have been so self-satisfied as to suppose that we could\r\nkeep down such people for ever?”\r\n\r\n“Our forty millions,” answered Hamdoullah Soubhi, “will not be so easily\r\nsuppressed. Remember, our language is spoken beyond the borders of\r\nChina, and our civilisation can be traced all over the world.”\r\n\r\nWhen I afterwards met Hamdoullah Soubhi, in a little restaurant\r\nadjoining the Assembly buildings, he was accompanied by a brother of the\r\nlate Djémal Pasha. I was glad of the opportunity to tell him that,\r\n“whatever the political mistakes of their former leader, I felt that the\r\nTurks had lost a great man.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe proprietor of this little restaurant is also a professor. He\r\ndetermined that, while cooks, and indeed all servants, were almost\r\nimpossible to obtain, the deputies should suffer no inconvenience. Now\r\nthey all either drop in at the professor’s, or ask him to send them a\r\nsnack to one of the rooms of the Assembly. The ready courtesy with which\r\nhe offered to contrive a meal _à l’anglaise_, for my special benefit,\r\nclearly showed he is always willing to do his best.\r\n\r\nH. Soubhi Bey’s tastes are very simple, and he detests show or bluff.\r\n“We discard superstitions, alike in life and religion,” he said; “only\r\nthe solid foundations of truth can resist the storm. Our National Pact,\r\nlike our faith, is solid, positive, and true.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn one occasion I met Haïdar Bey, _député_ for Vannes, the colonel’s\r\nadviser on rugs and carpets, whom he calls “the old brigand.” He told\r\nme, however, “the fellow was not dangerous;” and I surprised him by\r\ndeclaring that I had fallen in love, at the age of eight, with Hadji\r\nStavros, Edmund About’s “King of the Mountains,” and, in consequence,\r\nwas perfectly at home with brigands.\r\n\r\nHAÏDAR Bey does not carry the chaplet, which so many Orientals are\r\nalways counting, in order to check the temptation to smoke, but I\r\nnoticed he was clenching a piece of wax. “He’s training his muscles,”\r\nlaughed the colonel. “Brigands, you know, have to keep themselves very\r\nfit!”\r\n\r\nHe seemed to me, as a matter of fact, to have suffered more, physically,\r\nfrom the allied occupation than anyone else I met, except Essad Pasha,\r\nthe celebrated oculist, obviously destined for constant pain to the end\r\nof his days.\r\n\r\nHAÏDAR Bey had sworn he would never again speak to an Englishman on\r\naccount of our officers’ treatment of his mother. I could only assure\r\nhim, with all the earnestness at my command, that the people of England\r\nabominated every form of personal cruelty; and that one day, when the\r\nfacts were known, we should officially apologise, as I now privately\r\nexpressed my horror and shame.\r\n\r\nHis response was characteristic of these generous people! He arranged\r\nfor me a really charming little supper-party; making graceful allusions\r\nto England as she was before the war; and as, since my visit, he had\r\ndecided to think of her ... “I will only remember the occupation as a\r\nhideous nightmare!”\r\n\r\nI could sincerely say I had enjoyed every minute of the evening, from\r\nthe Circassian chicken specially prepared for me, to the Oriental music\r\nand Abdul Hamid’s own cigarettes.\r\n\r\nOur host himself had graciously come for us an hour before the appointed\r\ntime; a prudent gallantry, to ensure the arrival of his guests in the\r\ncrowded quarter described as “near the pump, which is perhaps near the\r\nMosque”! with neither street-name nor number to assist the traveller.\r\n\r\nAided by sticks and lanterns, we accordingly prepared to face the\r\ndangers of the way. It was impossible to hear oneself speak in the\r\nbiting wind; and our host, with his “lantern under thy feet,” as the\r\nBible calls it, was fully occupied in guiding us away from big stones\r\nand wide holes.\r\n\r\nWe were glad to reach his dimly-lighted room; over-heated, indeed, to\r\nWestern ideas; and sink into the cushioned divans covered with his\r\npriceless rugs. The _mézé_, or meal of hors d’œuvres, was served the\r\nmoment we arrived, with dainty dishes of fruit, cheese and olives.\r\n\r\nThe choirmaster of the Christian church had been specially invited to\r\nbring his band for our benefit. I found that, like so many of the\r\nChristians, even the priests, he had scarcely any Armenian. Indeed, they\r\nall wear the fez and speak of “our” country, “our” victories, and “our”\r\nghazi Pasha! It was in a Christian church that I once heard the\r\nfollowing prayer: “May the all powerful God bless our beloved nation\r\nTurkey, and all the heroic sons and children of this nation to which we\r\nare so proud to belong. Give grace and health to our commander, Mustapha\r\nKemal Pasha the ghazi, and to all the Ministers of the National\r\nAssembly, and all those who have sacrificed their life and comfort for\r\nour welfare.” The priest assured me that no one had “asked” him to offer\r\nup any such prayer, which was the spontaneous expression of his own\r\nfeelings!\r\n\r\nAll Armenians consider themselves “at home” in Turkey; as the Welsh are\r\n“at home” in England. About the same proportion know the language, the\r\nnational songs, history and literature, as we find in Wales. The priest\r\npreaches in Turkish because he desires the congregation to understand\r\nhim; though, if he knows Armenian, part of the Mass is said in that\r\nlanguage, for the sake of sentiment.\r\n\r\nIn these days, of course, the races have been provoked to mutual\r\njealousies and suspicions. I overheard greetings that certainly\r\n_sounded_ like the happy reunion of long-parted friends, and were,\r\nindeed, accompanied by all the outward and visible signs of affection,\r\nwhich the dignity of the European must always suppress.\r\n\r\n“We have missed you,” cried the affectionate Turk; “life is not what it\r\nused to be. None of us can take your place.”\r\n\r\nAnd the Armenian replied at once: “It was cruel to turn us against you.\r\nThose horrible English—that Lloyd George!”\r\n\r\nThey spoke of the happy days when the Armenians took care of Turkish\r\nchildren, whose parents had gone on pilgrimage to Mecca. Now they have\r\ncome back the best of friends; and I believe, as they do, that not even\r\nthe English could ever separate them again.\r\n\r\nOne of the guests, the Italian director of the Ottoman Bank, was very\r\nanxious that Colonel Mougin and I should not miss these signs of a\r\npermanent reconciliation. “You see,” he said, “it is only the Turks\r\nthemselves who can protect ‘minorities.’ It is easy enough for any\r\nArmenian to get on with them. The supposed antipathies are made in the\r\nStates.”\r\n\r\nThe Governor-General of the Ottoman Bank, M. Louis Steeg, also begged me\r\nto do all in my power to stop this useless propaganda. The Armenians are\r\nbegging to be ‘left alone.’”\r\n\r\nIt is manifest again that Mustapha Kemal includes Christian minorities\r\nin the “New Turkey” he has determined to save from veils, harems, and\r\nlattices; the crumbling remains of Byzantium, anti-progressive Hodjas,\r\nand the Byzantian Patriarch imposed on Constantinople!\r\n\r\nCertainly these Christian musicians gave us only Turkish music and\r\nsongs: love songs, military airs, the Moslem ‘Hymn of Independence’\r\n(known to every child in the land), Anatolian folk-songs, and, most\r\ninteresting and incomprehensible of all, the weird, piping solo that\r\naccompanies the dancing dervishes, a combination of sacred mystery,\r\nsentiment and melancholy.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, no European can expect to enter fully into Turkish music\r\nwithout a good deal of study.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd yet, deeply as I feel the charm of Eastern landscapes, the glorious\r\nsunsets or brilliant sunshine revealing white minarets against the black\r\ncypress, I still hold dearer memories of the old talks with my Turkish\r\nsister, beside the roseate mangal, as she revealed to me the fascinating\r\nmysteries of the life of the sons and daughters of her land.\r\n\r\nIt is the same to-day in the more strenuous and, in some respects, more\r\nWestern atmosphere of the proud National Assembly. Even if I have done\r\nbut little to convey the admiration their splendid resistance demands,\r\nwhich I so strongly feel, the effort to understand has brought me the\r\ngreatest pleasure. And whether or not I have earned, or merited, the\r\njoy, none can take it from me.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n       ROME, THE ETERNAL CITY—A VISIT TO THE CATHOLICS IN ANGORA\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERE is so often compensation for disappointment. Had I been able to\r\nreach Angora through Constantinople, had I not been held up six weeks by\r\nstrikes on sea, I should have missed the chance of another visit to\r\nRome—above all, of having an audience with Pope Pius XI.\r\n\r\nHis Holiness could not know, for I did not myself then imagine, the\r\nprecious gift he thus entrusted to me for his children in Anatolia. He\r\ncertainly would not feel the time wasted, could I convey to him the\r\nheartfelt joy and reverence with which they listened for my answers to\r\ntheir eager questions. “What is he like, our Holy Father? Is it true\r\nthat he always prays for us?”\r\n\r\nNo one could fail, indeed, to have been impressed by the deep sincerity\r\nwith which the Pope takes man’s sorrows to heart; the great anxiety that\r\noverwhelms him, not only for his own flock but for all humanity; and his\r\ngreat desire for peace.\r\n\r\nTowards Turkey, I believe the Christian world will follow the lead of\r\nGreat Britain; as in their attitude towards the Christian Powers, Islam\r\nwill follow the lead of Turkey. Now that Mustapha Kemal Pasha has raised\r\nTurkey again to be the true head of Islam, should not our whole policy\r\nin the East rest on her friendship?\r\n\r\nAs in politics, so in religion. Dare we listen to the appeal of American\r\nNonconformity for a “Holy War” _against_ Islam; dare we follow the\r\nAnglican into union with the Greek Church _against_ the followers of the\r\nProphet? Only the Roman Church has lived in perfect harmony in Turkey?\r\nThe only Christians to praise and honour the Moslem faith!\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne must come from an audience in the Vatican with sealed lips.\r\n\r\nBut when humanity is waiting for understanding and kindness; when, above\r\nall, the East is asking: “Can we trust the West?” it is impossible to\r\nremain altogether silent concerning the Holy Father of Rome.\r\n\r\nTurkey has been insulted, despised, and deceived by Christendom. Despite\r\nher utmost tolerance to every faith, she has been betrayed by those to\r\nwhom she was most indulgent. Missionaries she welcomed in Christ’s name,\r\nas messengers of His love to all men, have used their sacred privileges\r\nto organise enemy propaganda.\r\n\r\nTherefore will I bear witness: there is a father’s heart on Peter’s\r\nthrone; a father anxious for all his children, suffering; and _with no\r\ncrusade to urge against Islam_, also sons of God and brothers of Christ!\r\nFor him there is one “enemy,” and only one: the “Materialism” that is\r\npoisoning our civilisations; nourishing our pride, our jealousy, and our\r\nhate; threatening our faith.\r\n\r\nIs this “indiscretion”? Yet how is it possible to express one’s personal\r\nimpressions of an audience with the Sovereign Pontif! All the\r\nliteratures of the world have dedicated immortal pages to the Father of\r\nChristendom. They have paid homage to him, if not as spiritual head, at\r\nleast as a great and picturesque personality; and, above all, a\r\npersonality backed by the traditions of ages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BURNT QUARTER IN THE FRENCH PART OF SMYRNA NEAR THE QUAY.\r\n  p. 48\r\n]\r\n\r\nDumas, in his beautifully written interview with Pope Gregory XVI.,\r\ndescribes his terror at the thought of meeting the Pope. To-day such a\r\nsentiment is no longer possible. Awe and reverence have taken the place\r\nof terror. Excommunication has lost all the meaning it had in the Middle\r\nAges. And yet, deprived as he is of all temporal power, the Pope is\r\nexpected, by virtue of the age of his sacred office, to express himself\r\nin all moments of crisis. As spiritual head of the Christian Church, he\r\nis to-day in a difficult position. The Greeks and Armenians, it is true,\r\nare not for the most part his children. They belong, however, to\r\nbranches of the Christian Church; and no Pope, however much the poor\r\nmisguided peoples are responsible for their own misfortunes, can look\r\nwith indifference on what is happening to them, and may still happen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A LUNCHEON PARTY AT THE OTTOMAN BANK, ANGORA.\r\n\r\n  BOGHETTI.\r\n  (Director of the Ottoman Bank.)\r\n\r\n  OEILLET.\r\n  (Secretary to Colonel Mougin.)\r\n\r\n  MISS GRACE ELLISON.\r\n\r\n  HAÏDAR BEY.\r\n  (Deputé for Vannes.)\r\n\r\n  COLONEL MOUGIN.\r\n  p. 240\r\n]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, no Pope can forget what the Vatican owes to Turkey.\r\nIn that hospitable land, the Roman Catholic orders, expelled from\r\nFrance, sought refuge. Throughout the length and breadth of the country,\r\nCatholic missions thrive and prosper. Though they rarely, if ever, make\r\nconverts, they give care in sickness; comforts, education, and\r\ninstruction to the Turks. And who is responsible for the cultural French\r\nlanguage spoken in the Near East, if not the Jesuit Fathers?\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary religious tolerance on the part of the Turks has\r\nalways been incomprehensible. Disraeli’s protection of the Turk was born\r\nof his gratitude for the religious tolerance they extended to the Jew.\r\nJews, who could escape massacre in Russia, found then, as they find now,\r\na comfortable home where they are free to practice their religion and\r\nmake money. What more can they want?\r\n\r\nNaturally, then, seeing what the Vatican owes to Turkey, and Turkey to\r\nthe Vatican, the Pope is interested in the personality of M. Kemal\r\nPasha, and proved very willing to hear what a Western woman, with\r\nopportunities in the past of studying Turkish home life, knows of this\r\ngreat Nationalist hero.\r\n\r\nAnyone who has seen the ceremonies at the Vatican must be impressed by\r\ntheir great spectacular beauty. The Church of Rome has given the world\r\nsome of its finest art, literature and music. And at the Vatican itself,\r\nwherever the eye wanders, there is beauty—beauty of architecture, beauty\r\nof colouring. On the one side there is the gaudy costume of the Swiss\r\nGuard, with their scarlet and gold, in striking contrast to the grey\r\ncourtyard and the black dresses or mantillas of the lady visitors; there\r\nare the frescoes, the statues: and over all a veil of mystery and the\r\ncharm of history.\r\n\r\nFrom the time one’s carriage rumbles over the stones of the great\r\nunshaded courtyard to the side where the Pope’s apartments are situated,\r\none has the sensation of walking over a book of sacred history. It is\r\ntrue all Rome is history. The Vatican, however, is the history of the\r\nCatholic Church from the beginning, and as you go up the marble steps\r\nyou instinctively lower your voice, walking slowly and silently. For\r\nhave not all the greatest figures in the world’s history passed up that\r\nstaircase?\r\n\r\nThere is everywhere a delightful odour of books; but where are the\r\nbooks? Uniformed diplomatists, high officials, generals, cardinals in\r\ntheir scarlet splendour, priests in black and scarlet and purple,\r\nattendants in red damask court breeches, walk noiselessly in and out.\r\nAll the chairs seem so big, and the consoles and vases so huge and so\r\nvaluable, that a portrait of the kindly face of Pope Pius X. is a\r\nwelcome change. Seeing me looking at the peaceful, saintly face, my\r\nneighbour whispers: “C’était un vrai père.” One notices also a beautiful\r\nbust of Pope Benedict XV. Why do the photographers never do justice to\r\nhis fine intelligent face?\r\n\r\nMonsignor X. has come to fetch me. He, too, is keenly interested in\r\nAngora. Now I am taken to the Throne Room; the Holy Father comes forward\r\nto greet me. He stands whilst talking to me, with one hand resting on a\r\nlarge piece of antique furniture. Beginning to speak in English, he\r\ncontinues in French.\r\n\r\nThe Pope speaks most modern languages; and, as he receives every day,\r\nkeeps himself in personal touch not only with the best-known Catholics,\r\nbut with all the important personalities who come to Rome. He has\r\ntravelled extensively, is well-read in many languages, and has written\r\nbooks of the highest value. As a younger man, Monsignor Ceretti—the\r\nParis Papal Nonce—has told us, the Pope used often to read and write the\r\nwhole night through, and he has an inexhaustible fund of most valuable\r\ninformation. And what does he not know of Islam? He has studied it in\r\nall its phases; hence his great tolerance.\r\n\r\nClad in a white cloth soutane, with a wide white cape over his broad\r\nshoulders, a white cloth sash hanging in wide ends on the left side,\r\nwhite buttons and a white calotte and red shoes, the Holy Father stands\r\nout as a contrast in simplicity to his surroundings. His thick gold\r\nchain and handsomely chiselled cross, with its large diamonds, are his\r\nonly ornaments besides the pastoral ring.\r\n\r\nOf medium height and pale, his powerful face is young for his years, and\r\nhis large wide forehead quite unlined. His features are clear cut; his\r\neyes seem small, perhaps because of the thick glass of the spectacles,\r\nwhich he frequently adjusts.\r\n\r\nOne is particularly struck, however, by the power of his features and\r\nhis frank expression. It is a face of much intelligence, but, above all,\r\none of the greatest human kindness. This can be seen more from the mouth\r\nthan the eyes.\r\n\r\nI told the Pope why I was going to Angora, where, as the people knew me\r\nand trusted me, I hoped, at any rate, to achieve some good. An\r\nexpression of infinite sadness passed over his face as I continued: “All\r\nthis awful bloodshed, this useless suffering. Surely these things should\r\nnever have come upon us.”\r\n\r\nThere was, indeed, little his Holiness could say. He knows how useless\r\nit is now, to question on whose shoulders History will place the\r\nresponsibility for the diplomatic bungling in the Near East.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered, however, that he had written to M. Kemal,\r\nbegging him to do all in his power to prevent bloodshed as the army\r\nadvanced. The Pasha’s reply was dignified, wise, and sympathetic: surely\r\na key to his fine personality, as all can recognise it to-day.\r\n\r\nI said to the Pope: “Mustapha Kemal appears to me a man of great\r\nunderstanding, who would be capable of a _beau geste_ towards\r\nChristianity. His speeches are democratic, full of kindness and\r\nconsideration for his people, revealing a real desire and determination\r\nto lead them along the road to that prosperity which should be the\r\nheritage of a people dowered with a soil so fertile in precious\r\nminerals.... Yet, of course, other men in other countries have made\r\ngreat speeches and done nothing!”\r\n\r\nIn paying tribute to the personality of M. Kemal Pasha, so far as I\r\ncould then judge it, I said that he seemed to me a man of moderation,\r\nwho would always use his great influence to prevent bloodshed. Yet one\r\ntrembles at the thought of the moment when the army goes into\r\nConstantinople! The slightest friction, through no fault of the great\r\ngeneral himself, might have appalling results. Yet I have sufficient\r\nconfidence in the Turks to know they would not willingly harm one\r\nreligious order. It could only be by accident ... yet it would be\r\nterrible, and must not happen....\r\n\r\n“Nothing will happen, your Holiness,” I went on, “unless the Greeks\r\nbegin it. In their tragic and hasty exodus from Thrace were they not\r\nreminded, in terror of what might be, of their own conduct in Asia\r\nMinor?” Yet the Pope’s face was very anxious. There was great pathos in\r\nhis voice.\r\n\r\nIn what almost tragic situations a Pope thus often finds himself! The\r\nspiritual father of both sides; nevertheless neutral, or, if not\r\nneutral, criticised by both ... always expected to dispense generosity\r\nand mercy—and receiving none; no wonder the strain of the war killed\r\nboth Benedict XV. and Pius X.\r\n\r\nIn Angora I told M. Kemal Pasha of the Pope’s great desire for peace.\r\nWhat was to be the Pasha’s _beau geste_ towards Christianity. I\r\nsuggested he might, as S. Sophia was a Christian Church, give it back to\r\nthe Pope, as spiritual head of Christendom.\r\n\r\nM. Kemal Pasha replied: “Had there been only one branch of the Christian\r\nChurch, although S. Sophia has now become part of our Moslem traditions,\r\nit might have been possible. As the Christian Church is so much divided,\r\nit is impossible. We should only excite the Russians, the Greeks, and\r\nthe Anglicans, to come and fight each other on our soil for S. Sophia;\r\nand the _beau geste_ you suggest for peace would lead to eternal\r\nconflict and strife. Nevertheless, we are so anxious to do all in our\r\npower to honour Christianity in the eyes of the world that if, by our\r\nretaining S. Sophia as a mosque, we are really giving offence to the\r\nCatholic Church, we would either turn it into a museum, or close it\r\nforever. None must ever be able to say that we have intentionally\r\ninjured the Christian Church.”\r\n\r\nI complimented the Pasha on his fine sentiments toward the Christian\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\n“It is natural,” he replied. “I am only carrying on our traditional\r\ntolerance to all religions. The Roman Catholics and all Christians, as\r\nwell as the Jews, have always had full religious freedom in our country.\r\n\r\nAs to the _beau geste_, what can I say? You are free to go anywhere you\r\nlike in Anatolia; talk to the Greeks, talk to the Armenians. If there is\r\nany cause of complaint, we will see that it is removed at once. We want\r\nthe Christians to be happy in our country. We have given them full\r\nreligious liberty, and equal rights with Moslems: can we do more? I feel\r\nsure that, in spite of all the devastation and atrocities committed by\r\nthe Greeks in our country, in a very short time they will be back\r\namongst us: the great friends they were before the Powers interfered.”\r\n\r\nRauf Bey, the Prime Minister, echoed the sentiments of the Pasha. “Tell\r\nthe Pope,” he said, “to rest assured we are doing all in our power to\r\nmake his people happy and contented. Can there be a finer _beau geste_\r\nthan this?”\r\n\r\nAs the Pasha had suggested, I went everywhere, saw and questioned\r\neveryone. The Greek prisoners were bitter in their criticism of England,\r\nwho betrayed them and left them unaided to fight the Turkish army.\r\nSurely the least intelligent of our military attachés would have seen\r\nthe cruelty of such a move.\r\n\r\nContrary to what most people suppose, there is a Christian colony left\r\nin Angora. It is mostly Armenian, though there are still many Greeks.\r\nThe community nevertheless calls itself, and always gives as its legal\r\nnationality, “Catholic”; a delicate way of avoiding difficult questions.\r\n\r\nMass is said on Sunday three times, partly in Armenian, which many of\r\nthe Armenians do not understand, and the rest in Turkish. All the\r\nArmenians wear fezes, and prayers are said for Turkey. The little chapel\r\nis primitive and picturesque; never, however, has one heard such strange\r\n_Ave Marias_ or _Glorias_ or _Agnus Deis_ as those sung in their Turkish\r\nsetting.\r\n\r\nDuring my Christmas visit to the head of the Armenian Church at Angora,\r\nI asked him what message he wished me to give the Pope on his behalf. I\r\ntold him the Pope was anxious about the Christians; and he might tell\r\nme, in confidence, if he was not happy in Turkey.\r\n\r\nFor my visit the Armenian orphans had put their home in _festere\r\naltere_. They had made cakes and sweets to be served with coffee and\r\ntea.\r\n\r\nThen it was that I had the pleasure of speaking to them about the\r\nwonderful personality of the Pope as I had seen him in Rome; and of\r\ntelling them that, above all, their Father in Christ stood for loyalty\r\nto their State. The Turks had never hampered their loyalty to their\r\nChurch, and the Pope would never hamper the loyalty and obedience they\r\nowed to the Sovereign State.\r\n\r\nThen the dusky-skinned orphans, boys and girls together, were marched\r\nbefore me, each taking my hand, kissing it and raising it to their\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\nAs I said afterwards to Colonel Mougin: “I wish it were possible to\r\nsupplement the meagre funds with which Father Babadjanian is maintaining\r\nthis little colony of poor children.”\r\n\r\n“Tell the Holy Father,” said Father Babadjanian, “that we are\r\n_perfectly_ happy with the Turks. They are trying to send us away from\r\nAngora for economical reasons, but we do not want to go. We have been\r\ntold by the Grand National Assembly that we shall have exactly the same\r\nrights as the Moslems—no more, no less. What more can we expect or\r\ndesire?\r\n\r\n“Tell His Holiness to inform Europe and America,” he concluded, “that it\r\nis useless to try and protect _disloyal_ Christian minorities here. It\r\ncannot be done by any Church, or any League of Nations. We know very\r\nwell, and events have proved it, that so long as we remain _loyal_ to\r\nthe Turkish Government, all will be well. All the trouble that has come\r\nto us has arisen from the disloyalty and political intrigues of the\r\nOrthodox Armenians and Greeks, and, above all, from outside propaganda.\r\nSo much has been said and written about an “Armenian Home”; let America\r\noffer Armenians that national home. Let the Powers, since it is they who\r\nare the cause of all the trouble, only recognise that they must provide\r\nhomes elsewhere for every Christian who wants to go, or else leave us\r\nalone....\r\n\r\n“If you only knew how we tremble before this useless propaganda, how we\r\npray to be delivered from our European friends. _Turkey is our home._ We\r\nhave to live with the Turks on friendly terms; and will gladly do so, if\r\n_only_ this political propaganda can cease.”\r\n\r\nColonel Mougin, who accompanied me on this visit, can vouch for these\r\nstatements, which he considered so important that he communicated them\r\nto his Government.\r\n\r\nI have delivered the message of M. Kemal Pasha and Father Babadjanian to\r\nthe Holy Father. He will receive, also, fuller impressions of my\r\ninteresting trip through Anatolia; and fuller descriptions of this\r\ncountry and those people who have made so splendid a fight for freedom\r\nand independence.\r\n\r\nThroughout the length and breadth of Anatolia, prayers for peace have\r\nbeen echoed and re-echoed. There must be peace; but not at the expense\r\nof the sovereign rights of the people.\r\n\r\nIt is a comfort to the Turks, nevertheless, to know that the head of the\r\nCatholic Church stretches out the hand of friendship towards them, and\r\nprays for their peace and prosperity through the brotherhood of Moslems\r\nand Christians in the East.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n       THREE DIPLOMATS AT ROME—THE GUARDIANSHIP OF THE HOLY TOMB\r\n\r\n\r\nIN Rome I met three diplomats; as different from each other as night\r\nfrom day, as the Pope of Rome from the Khalif of Islam—a false\r\ncomparison often made in New Turkey to-day.\r\n\r\nWe have described the Pope; the sanctity of his office, the odour of\r\npiety in which he dwells. The Pope is not of the world; he is above the\r\nworld-elected, not born. The Khalif, like an hereditary king, inherits\r\nhis position as Head of Islam; which means that he owes his position to\r\nthe hazard of fortune, not to personality or virtue.\r\n\r\nI have met all the Khalifs from Abdul Hamid to his present descendant,\r\nwho was, when I saw him, the third in succession. He appeared to me a\r\nkindly, cultured gentleman and a talented artist. My host at that time,\r\nPrince Youssouff Zeddine, heir to the then Sultan, had frequently\r\ninvited me to the Palace, and always spoke highly of his younger\r\nbrother. The Prince had a touching affection for England, and, with\r\nDjémal Pasha (then Minister of Marine) for interpreter, would gladly\r\nlisten to endless stories of olden and modern days. Passing from Alfred\r\nand the cakes; through Drake, Gordon, and Princess Mary; to his\r\nfavourite tale of the Suffragettes chained to the grille at Westminster,\r\nI sought to inspire this unhappy man with memories of the greatness of\r\nthe England he loved so well.\r\n\r\nIf, by any chance, I varied a phrase or omitted the slightest detail, he\r\nwould beg Djémal “to respectfully remind Mademoiselle that she is going\r\ntoo fast!” It is difficult, indeed, to believe that the man who laughed\r\nso heartily at the words “Votes for Women,” could have ended his own\r\nexistence. He dared to say to the Turkish Parliament, “On no account\r\nmust we be on the wrong side with England”; and the next day he was\r\ndead!\r\n\r\nNot only in Turkey, but throughout Islam, which includes India, there is\r\nno institution so sacred as the Khalifate, yet the term is meaningless\r\nif the Khalif loses Arabia. Next in sanctity to Mecca, in Moslem eyes,\r\ncomes Jerusalem, for all the prophets of that Holy City are sacred to\r\nIslam, though her prophets have no honour in Judea or among Christians.\r\nShould we not tremble when Christian Powers attempt to tamper with lands\r\nof pilgrimage like Hedjaz, and when they trample upon the traditions of\r\nthe Khalifate?\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt Rome, Osman Nyzami Pasha represented Constantinople, while\r\nDjelaleddine Arif Bey was Minister for Angora. The former did not,\r\nindeed, go into exile with the Nationalists; but his varied experience\r\nas soldier, statesman, and ambassador has given him a rare knowledge of\r\nEurope that makes him popular and useful in diplomacy. Alas, now,\r\nhowever, his career ends.\r\n\r\nTen years ago in Constantinople he greeted me with, “Dear child, what\r\nfor did you do this dreadful thing,” as I was returning from the Persian\r\nMouharrem, the anniversary of the assassination of Hussein, son of the\r\nProphet. The Spanish Minister, who was with us, had fainted outright,\r\nalthough familiar with bull-fights. His wife, Mme. M., a Swede, had more\r\ncourage than either of us; but I almost fell into the Ambassador’s arms\r\nas I reached my hotel.\r\n\r\nIn a ring formed round a centre of blazing torches, white-robed men wail\r\nand mourn for the holy martyr, slashing their heads with swords. They\r\ndip their hands in the flowing blood, and sprinkle it all over their\r\nfaces. I was haunted for weeks by the ghastly spectacle, which I shall\r\nnever be able to forget, of those stained robes and faces, amidst the\r\nwild fanatical shrieks. When, as often happens, a man thus kills himself\r\nin the fury of exaltation, he is acclaimed a martyr, and his family are\r\npensioned for life.\r\n\r\nWhen I asked why such awful ceremonies were permitted, I was reminded of\r\nTurkey’s “non-interference” with every creed and all the “pieties” of\r\nall peoples.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt Rome, I lodged in a quiet convent, which closed at 7.30. But the\r\nAmbassador called at eight and was followed by a succession of Turkish\r\nfriends, until Mihrinour and her husband arrived at 10.30. I apologised\r\nnext morning to the Mother Superior for such unseemly interruptions of\r\nher ordered life; explaining, in a fifteen minutes’ lecture, how anxious\r\na Turk would always feel for the comfort of any friend. “You are\r\nperfectly right,” she said, “I know them well. I lived eighteen years on\r\nthe shores of the Bosphorus!”\r\n\r\nDjelaleddine Arif Bey gave me a right royal welcome to Rome, and allowed\r\nme to trouble him with all sorts of questions. In Constantinople he had\r\nbeen what we call Dean of the Faculty of Law, and one day, on an\r\nofficial visit to the Sultan, wearing a frock-coat and patent-leather\r\nshoes, _he had just time to escape to Angora_, dressed as he was. His\r\nknowledge of both the Cheriat and European Laws was invaluable to the\r\nAssembly, and it is a delight to hear from his own lips that Turkey is\r\ngoing to establish her _own_ Constitution, not a poor imitation of ours.\r\n\r\n“Our justice has been paralysed by capitulations,” he said; and told me\r\nof an Italian murderer who had found sanctuary in his Consulate, because\r\nthe Kavass would not give him up. “We have been bound and fettered all\r\nthese years, but it cannot go on.”\r\n\r\nHis admirable organisation of Justice in Angora developed from one\r\ncolleague to twenty-five assistants, for work which occupied three\r\nhundred men in Constantinople! Yet he very soon established complete\r\norder, though after the peace he hopes for still greater perfection.\r\n\r\nHe was interested in the personality of Cardinal Gasparri, whom I had\r\nmet for the first time. I found him a great contrast to Cardinal Merry\r\nde Val, with whom I had long discussions about Islam ten years ago.\r\n\r\nShrewdest of diplomats, keenest of observers, is there one move of the\r\nworld’s political chess-board he has not penetrated? Seeing, knowing,\r\njudging everything, could he make a mistake? In a State Church he would\r\nbe a grave danger; but the days of State Churches are almost no more. As\r\nthe Turkish minister remarked: “A Church needs more than anything a\r\nlevel-headed diplomatist having no connection with politics.” The\r\nCardinal, then, is far too clever a man to undervalue Islam.\r\n\r\nHe has studied the greatest living authorities, in translations when he\r\ncannot read the originals, upon all the wonderful books of the East, and\r\nlistens to men learned in the Koran. In theology, as in politics, none\r\ncould catch him napping. One may, perhaps, guess something of his\r\nopinions by listening carefully to such questions as he may put to you;\r\nfor he tells you nothing and seems to gather up all you know almost\r\nbefore you are conscious of having spoken. I _do_ remember, however,\r\nthat he asked me what the Turks proposed to do about the Holy Tomb?\r\n\r\nTo this I answered that Djelaleddini Arif Bey had said: “There could be\r\nno decision taken about Palestine without consulting the Turks. This\r\nastute lawyer had always bidden the Catholic authorities to remember\r\nthat Christ, according to the Koran, is of miraculous birth, is one of\r\nIslam’s most venerated prophets. For the Moslem to blaspheme the Virgin\r\nMary would be a heinous offence. To hand over the guardianship of the\r\nHoly Tomb to the Israelites is, therefore, a direct insult to Islam.”\r\n\r\nFethi Bey also said: “We have all our work cut out looking after our own\r\nfrontiers, yet we have always faithfully guarded the tomb of Christ, our\r\nprophet. What can we think, if the Powers now prefer to entrust it to\r\nthe Jews who crucified Him and still deny Him?”\r\n\r\nEven as Mecca is to the Moslem, should Calvary be to us. Shall we who\r\nare called Christians suffer the Tomb we do not guard ourselves, to be\r\ntaken from those who have faith in Christ?\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n EN ROUTE FOR CONSTANTINOPLE—A NIGHT AT BILIDJIK UNDER THE FROST-LADEN\r\n                                 SKIES\r\n\r\n\r\nONE does not expect comfort in an unheated railway carriage, with snow a\r\nfoot and a half deep, and the temperature 15° below zero. As we left\r\nAngora we also noticed that one of the carriage windows was missing, and\r\na courteous official kept back the train to insert one from another\r\ncompartment! We were grateful, indeed, for even then the cold was hard\r\nto bear.\r\n\r\nThe little engine is now ploughing its way _downhill_ but still slowly,\r\nsince halts are needed to renew its strength for the double task of\r\n“traction” and sweeping away the snow.\r\n\r\nWe are well supplied with food for a five-days’ journey, so that over a\r\ncheerful meal we can almost forget to feel frozen, and soon find we have\r\ncovered the thirty-five hours to Eski-Chéir.\r\n\r\nFrom Eski-Chéir to Kada-Keuy, where the lines have been cut, is a short\r\ndistance; but, mercifully, it is not so cold as in the mountains. From\r\nthere we travel in a yaili (native carriage) which has evidently seen\r\nbetter days and, let us hope, better springs. They have been removed\r\naltogether from one side, and we should have been easier without the\r\nworn remnants on the other! As there are no seats, one has to be propped\r\nup by any available rugs or cushions, unless you prefer lying down at\r\nfull length. But the little cart is lined with red-cotton brocade, while\r\ngreen curtains, looking-glasses, and tassels complete the “decoration”!\r\nIt must be delightful to saunter along on a summer’s day; and draw your\r\ncurtains for a night in the open; but even the straw, the mattress, and\r\nmany rugs cannot transform the yaili to a _train de luxe_ in winter.\r\n\r\nTo catch “the express” at Bilidjik we have to drive in two and a half\r\nhours a distance that requires a much longer time. So, with good horses\r\nand a fearless driver, we rattle away, up hill and down, over bumps and\r\nstones. The luggage is thrown out, my thermos is shaken to pieces, and\r\nwe are flung violently against the roof! Bruised and bleeding, we hold\r\non in grim silence; since time, too, flies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  The Yaili, or Native Carriage, with Drawn Curtains.\r\n]\r\n\r\nEven at this pace we cannot escape the oppression of desolation. On\r\nevery side lie smashed engines, burnt railway carriages, and villages in\r\ncinders. As dusk falls, only a fatalist, in a country of fatalists,\r\ncould venture the rush down sharp descents cut through a precipice of\r\n800 feet!\r\n\r\nFate, indeed, preserved us, only to prove its irony; for when we reached\r\nthe once prosperous Bilidjik, still beautiful in its ruins, we hear that\r\na landslip on the line has made traffic impossible for some days to\r\ncome. In Anatolia, one must be ready to do as the Anatolians; and we are\r\nfaced with the prospect of a night under the frost-laden skies. There is\r\nnot even a chair to be found, though “kindness” quickly contrives a seat\r\nfor me from a pile of logs. Here I can rest awhile; and by brisk walks\r\nat short intervals probably keep up my circulation until the welcome\r\ndawn....\r\n\r\nSomeone, however, suggested that we should beg for shelter in one of the\r\nluggage-vans already crowded with men and women—naturally, in separate\r\ncompartments. One thought of the poor villagers we had seen huddled\r\ntogether in their holes on the mountains; and realised that even the\r\nfloor of a luggage-van may be a “luxury.”\r\n\r\nHere turban-headed men are sitting on their prayer-carpets, some sound\r\nasleep in that uncomfortable attitude, others eating, and others\r\npraying, but none uttering a word of complaint.\r\n\r\nLooking around for a seat amidst the wilderness of food and bed-clothes,\r\nI suddenly hear a few cheery words in English, to my amazement and\r\ndelight. Here is one of the American Relief Workers, prepared and\r\nthankful to spend the night among the strange crowd. With the\r\nresourcefulness of his nation, he is provided with a large hat-box that\r\nwill serve as seat or table, and contains both food and bed-clothes.\r\nFrom his “seat,” therefore, he quickly extracts some sandwiches of most\r\ndelicious pea-nut butter, making a cup of tea for me on his “table.”\r\n\r\nAll eyes are drawn to the neat dispatch of these preparations and the\r\nmarvellous ingenuity of his packing. From that veritable box of Pandora\r\ncame solid alcohol, tins, kettles, goblets and card-board plates. The\r\nfood itself was kept in clean, little linen bags.\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, a strange lesson in efficiency and practical hygiene,\r\ndelivered in the wilderness! His unpractical, Eastern neighbour is\r\nmeanwhile struggling with a bit of old newspaper, from which a most\r\nunappetising collection of honey and eggs and nuts and bread are\r\ntumbling in dirty confusion, as the broken eggs and printer’s ink\r\ntrickle in a discoloured stream on the floor.\r\n\r\n“If only you would send out a good company of missionaries in hygiene,”\r\nI cried out, in my excitement, “the other gospels would follow as a\r\nmatter of course. The world will be a far better place when America\r\ncomes to the East and preaches the need for exterminating the house-fly\r\nand other insects with the fine zeal she is now devoting to the\r\nextermination of the Turk.”\r\n\r\nMy new friend—I had almost said compatriot—laughs good-naturedly at my\r\nenthusiasm; and in a few moments, despite my sympathy with Anatolia, I\r\nam again compelled to recognise that I am, after all, a woman of the\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nWhen someone brought in a blazing mangal and carefully closed every door\r\nof the crowded luggage-van, the American soon found a polite excuse to\r\njump out. Five minutes later I, too, ventured to open the door and call\r\nout to ask him for a helping hand. Both of us knew it was far better for\r\nus to die of cold in the fresh air than to choke in those thick charcoal\r\nfumes. I will hold a light while he digs out a hole, for sleep on the\r\nbosom of Mother Earth.\r\n\r\nBut now two charming Turkish boys, the sons of Moueddine Pasha, in our\r\nparty, are telling me that they are terribly distressed at my\r\ndiscomfort. It is in vain for me to assure them that no one could blame\r\n_them_. Somehow, they find the _Commandant de la place_; and, at his\r\ndirection, gallantly tramp back for two and a half hours, to bring me a\r\nmattress from the Governor’s house which, placed on three standard\r\noil-boxes, forms my bed. Meanwhile, the Commandant, who is familiar with\r\nEurope and speaks fluent German, earnestly begs me to excuse this\r\nterrible reception. “It is the work of Lloyd George,” he adds, as for\r\nevery disaster in Anatolia the same cause is proclaimed. Ask a peasant\r\nwho killed his sons, and he will reply without hesitation, “Lloyd\r\nGeorge.” Our late Premier has now become super-bogeyman of the Near East\r\nfor Moslems and Christians alike.\r\n\r\nAll through the night strains break on my ears of the Anatolian\r\nfolk-songs; the expression of that strangely resigned happiness of a\r\nlong-suffering people which we of the West must half-envy and, at the\r\nsame time, half-despise. Average human nature is only too apt to neglect\r\nthose who never complain; and if others appeal for them, to say—as even\r\nAmerica has said—“It is too big a problem for us to tackle.”\r\n\r\nWith so much goodwill around me, the night passed far more quickly than\r\neven my natural optimism could have foretold. And before stepping into\r\nthe yaili that will carry us on to Broussa, I try to express to the\r\nkindly peasants a little of the gratitude and admiration in my heart.\r\n\r\n“We do not lack anything,” they assure me. “All we want is to save our\r\nFatherland. It would be wrong of us to use up the wood and material for\r\nbuilding houses that may be required in the war.”\r\n\r\nThen, for farewell, the old Bible-greeting of “God be with you.”... “And\r\nbring us peace,” is all I can find voice to reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n FROM BILIDJIK TO BROUSSA BY YAILI—AFTER THE DAY’S ROUGHENING EXPERIENCES\r\n                ONE CAN SLEEP WHATEVER THE ACCOMMODATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR adieux to Bilidjik did not delay us long. As there were no trains to\r\nConstantinople, we had to take the road to Broussa and Moudania, whence\r\nthe boat runs to Constantinople. I now joined the American in one\r\ncarriage, the two Turkish boys following in a second. Although _yaili_\r\nmeans “a carriage with springs,” neither of ours justified their name,\r\nfor they had none. An American, however, is nothing if not resourceful,\r\nand my companion performed wonders with straw, rugs, and boxes.\r\n\r\nIt was about nine o’clock when we started along the muddy roadway, in\r\ncharge of one of the most happy-go-lucky coachmen it has ever been my\r\ngood fortune to employ. He had ten animals of his own before the war,\r\nand, now the Greeks have taken them all, he is making a fresh start with\r\nthe best he can hire from others. He _said_ that these were steady and\r\nsound, but I could not believe we should have known the difference, over\r\nthese ploughed fields on the edge of the mountains, so caked with mud\r\nthat our carriages frequently stuck fast. It was a wearisome business\r\nenough, the constant alighting to be dug out for fresh starts; but I was\r\naltogether beyond sharing the American’s alarm lest we should sink for\r\never in a bog! I was far more concerned about the difficulty of getting\r\nreally comfortable, among my disordered rugs and shawls.\r\n\r\nAs our coachman provides us with many evidences of Greek barbarity from\r\nthe ruins of every village we pass, my companion’s indignation shows\r\nrapid signs of approach to fever heat. “We’ve not played ‘straight,’” he\r\ncried, “I am not pro-Greek nor pro-Turk, and, at the moment, I haven’t\r\nmuch use for Christians; but I don’t see myself keeping quiet about all\r\nthis. You and I have to get quick and publish a little truth for a\r\nchange.”\r\n\r\nI told him that I had been trying in vain to get something done, or at\r\nleast known, about Angora; but that if ever an article of mine included\r\na word about Greek atrocities, the editorial scissors promptly got busy,\r\nand the truth remained untold.\r\n\r\nObviously the American belonged to that fine type, which abounds in\r\nyoung countries, who put all their dollars into the acquisition of\r\nknowledge, and who delight in using the knowledge they have acquired,\r\nbacked by their own wealth, in the service of mankind. His keen\r\ninquiries about _my_ impressions of the sad people he had come so far to\r\nunderstand, were proof enough that no kind of vanity, or pursuit of\r\nself-glorification, lay behind his insatiable curiosity.\r\n\r\nI was much interested to find that he agreed with me in having noticed\r\nhow strongly the “personal” element enters into all one’s relations with\r\nany Turk. If they do not like one, you might as well stay in England. If\r\nyour personality attracts them, it will make no difference where you\r\nhappen to have been born.\r\n\r\n“They are called ignorant and fanatical; but I find that even the most\r\nilliterate understand enough of our civilisation to make any honest\r\nEnglishwoman heartily ashamed of our ignorance and insularity.”\r\n\r\n“Remember,” he said, “how little we Americans really know of you, or you\r\nof us.”\r\n\r\n“I _do_ remember how I shocked one of your compatriots by confessing\r\nthat I had the most shaky idea of the occasion for your ‘Thanksgiving,’\r\nbut he afterwards admitted he had imagined till quite recently, that\r\n‘Boxing Day’ was the annual event of our national sport!”\r\n\r\nThere was little to break the monotony of our lonely journey except a\r\nlarge number of caravans, and, every now and again, one of those tiny\r\nlittle donkeys, used to lead a troop of from nine to fifteen camels!\r\n\r\n“Now you see,” said the ‘man from the States,’ “why we sometimes speak\r\nof a ‘conceited ass!’”\r\n\r\n“Only,” I answered, “this little fellow has something to be conceited\r\nabout. He has the right to say ‘look at me,’ as he trots along with the\r\ndouble row of turquoise beads round his neck, leading these great big\r\nchaps behind him. When he chooses to push ahead, they must hurry after\r\nhim; and when he condescends to turn round and ‘look over’ them, for all\r\nthe world as an officer might ‘eye’ his men, you could not discover a\r\nmore striking example of personality in the East. I declare I have\r\nfallen in love with that charming ass!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  “He has the right to say, ‘Look at me.’”\r\n]\r\n\r\n“Very well,” he replied with a laugh, “the next time anyone calls me an\r\n‘ass,’ I shall be proud to accept the compliment.”\r\n\r\n“But, seriously,” I replied, “asses are seldom as black as they’re\r\npainted. After all, to be stubborn is one form of personality. I\r\nremember staying in a French chateau during the war, where one donkey\r\nhad taken over the duties and responsibilities of the eighteen horses,\r\nwhich had been requisitioned by the State. On Sundays, tied up to a tree\r\nin the churchyard, while the family was inside the church, he always\r\nwaited to hear the Sanctus bell, and then brayed his loudest. He must\r\ntake part in the Mass!”\r\n\r\nOne rarely sees any driver astride his camel. He may be “considering his\r\nbeast,” but, on the other hand, he may not. For of every variety of\r\nsickness (of the sea, the home, or love itself) is not camel-sickness\r\nthe worst?\r\n\r\nMy companion agreed that he had not found the Turks either stubborn or\r\nunreasonable. “Everyone I met in Anatolia made an honest attempt to\r\nunderstand my point of view, even when I endeavoured to explain or at\r\nleast to excuse, English policy.\r\n\r\n“Turks are ‘stubborn,’ if you insist on the phrase, about the future of\r\ntheir country; but they have given a great deal of thought to the\r\nsubject, and they speak from experience that has been bought at a big\r\nprice. I have never encountered that uncomfortable type of mind we know\r\nso well among ourselves, and in a more aggressive, if less dangerous,\r\nform in the States, which nothing will move from its ‘pet’ hatred or\r\nchosen love, _in spite of_ great culture and general understanding.\r\n\r\n“I will not quote President Wilson, because we have an even better\r\nillustration in the late Lord Bryce. Few men could claim wider culture,\r\nfew have been so universally acknowledged a great statesman, yet the\r\nTurk to him was no better than a red rag to a bull! And when he said\r\nthat these people were ‘unspeakable,’ the world believed it.\r\n\r\n“I once attended a debate on whether ‘the Turks should, or should not,\r\nbe forced to abandon Constantinople.’ A judge from Constantinople had\r\nbeen called to open the discussion, who said, among other things, that\r\n‘this eternal reference to India as an excuse for backing Turkey was\r\nmere nonsense; _because Lord Bryce had said that India was indifferent\r\nto Turkey’s fate_!’\r\n\r\n“Seyed Hossain, a member of the Khaliphat Delegation, then rose to\r\ncontradict this assertion. He said that he had come all the way from\r\nIndia with the Khaliphat Delegation, for the express purpose of\r\nprotesting against the attitude of the Allies towards _his_ Khaliph (the\r\nSultan of Turkey).”\r\n\r\n“‘My dear Sir,’ answered the judge, ‘I have absolutely full confidence\r\nin any statement made by Lord Bryce.’\r\n\r\n“The poor Indian was staggered for a moment, but soon found courage to\r\nreply: ‘Has a man like Lord Bryce the _right_ to defy commonsense,\r\nstatistics, and accurate, official information. My presence here is a\r\nclear proof that my statement is correct.’\r\n\r\n“‘Your presence means nothing to me,’ was the ‘polite’ retort, which\r\nconcluded the debate!\r\n\r\n“There is, of course, a very stupid kind of loyalty in such an attitude,\r\nbut it tempts one to almost despair of ever hoping to fight against its\r\ncriminal injustice to Turkey.\r\n\r\n“It is a heavy responsibility for great men if they give rein to an\r\nobstinate and unreasonable prejudice. It is so hard to resist those we\r\nrespect.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“What do you really think about the Americans in Turkey? I am so anxious\r\nto do my utmost for these poor people, asked my friend.”\r\n\r\n“I, who love them, will honestly say I fear that the influence of your\r\npeople is very dangerous. For _one_ who does good, as I am sure you have\r\ndone, there are fifty who only make mischief, even undoing much of what\r\nyou have achieved.”\r\n\r\n“The supreme merit of the Nationalist movement comes from the fact that\r\nTurks are beginning to be _themselves_. All must be well in the end if\r\nthey are content to ‘swallow’ Europe in small doses. Already we have\r\nwith us that dangerous anomaly the European Turk. The big capitals kill\r\nhis sincerity and capture his affections by their vices. His mysterious\r\ndark eyes (an everyday commonplace in his own country) too often prove\r\n‘false lights’ leading him on to the rocks. It is a test of character to\r\nask the European Turk if he is not ‘longing to get back to Turkey?’ When\r\nI put the question to Hussein Raghib, he said ‘if I must stay here for\r\nmy country, I will stay, but I am never happy for long so far away from\r\nAngora and all it means to me.’ Certainly a healthy view!\r\n\r\n“It is surely better to let the Turks work out their own salvation, only\r\nhelping when they ask for help; and even then we should be careful to\r\ngive them what they desire and not what _we_ may think best for them. It\r\nis really cruel to tamper with other people’s ideas, particularly their\r\nreligion, and it does no good in Turkey. The gospel of Islam has made\r\nthem the fine race they will always remain at heart.\r\n\r\n“You can do good in practical, material affairs and for the diminution\r\nof physical suffering. I wish every American would preach the gospel of\r\nthe Rockefeller Institute all over the world: the creed of the open\r\nwindow, a crusade against vermin and microbes. That would bring us a\r\n‘new’ world.\r\n\r\n“I would like to see a closer union between the Red Cross and the Red\r\nCrescent. The Turks have not your organising ability; but they have many\r\nsound ideas already operating in their hospitals.\r\n\r\n“We must be quite sure that our civilisation is perfect before we force\r\nit on others. It is ‘mine,’ and I owe much to it; but I, for one, can\r\nsee much to criticise.”\r\n\r\n“I, too, believe we have no right to offer more than material\r\nassistance, and such an example as our own efforts, towards the best we\r\nknow, may afford.”\r\n\r\n“It is a great deal, if given in the right spirit. My own idea of\r\n‘service’ is to try and understand the East, to prevent such terrible\r\nblunders as our ignorance of them have brought about, which may even\r\ninvolve us in the horrors of another war.\r\n\r\n“Why should we ask Orientals to accept our civilisation and ‘look at\r\nlife’ through our eyes. It is no wiser or juster than asking a woman to\r\nsee nothing except through a man’s eyes; and to work in his way. She\r\ncannot do that, and has suffered in the attempt. Your work is even a\r\ngreat peril. It is only too probable that you will be ‘starting’ them on\r\nthe wrong road, and you must soon leave them to find their own way.\r\n\r\n“If I am wrong, at least I speak in all sincerity; and I have studied\r\nthe question for many years. As I see it, our Western civilisations have\r\nmuch to learn from the East in pity and humanity.”\r\n\r\n“Osman Nyzami Pasha said to me once, in Rome, ‘you must not judge a\r\nnation by its Government but by the gods it creates for itself in its\r\nown image.’ The ancient Greeks peopled Olympus with gods of revolting\r\nimmorality; but you in Oxford forget that chapter of the story. The God\r\nof the North——”\r\n\r\nHe paused, and I took up the challenge.\r\n\r\n“The cold, harsh, and unforgiving Deity; the bogeyman of my childhood,\r\nalways ready with some awful punishment for the least shortcoming.\r\n\r\n“Why are our Puritan countries, whose God is love, so unjust to women,\r\nkeeping them down under cruel and illogical laws. It is idle for men to\r\nsay that no laws can diminish the deep respect they accord to women,\r\nwhich, in fact, is seldom shown to any of us except their wives,\r\ncertainly not to woman as a woman.\r\n\r\n“I certainly hold no brief for ‘irregularity,’ but there is something\r\nwrong with a conception of God which has produced the immeasurable gulf\r\nbetween the married and the unmarried mother. Humanity is not of our\r\nmaking; the ‘imperfect’ man has no right to demand ‘perfection’ from all\r\nwomen. Has he not made and tolerated _War_ that has overthrown every\r\nstandard of morality, changed all our ‘values,’ shattered every ideal,\r\nleaving religion nowhere, and two million women without a mate?\r\n\r\n“Such is the civilisation that dares to point a finger of scorn at the\r\nunmarried mother; and, by dismissing her, characterless and unpensioned,\r\nfrom every respectable avenue of support, dares to brand a child as\r\nunwanted, and push the innocent young life into secret and shameful\r\nsurroundings. Those who should help, with all the power of their\r\nsheltered purity, prefer to keep themselves ‘too respectable for any\r\nknowledge of these uncomfortable problems,’ since they are good and\r\nfaithful servants of One who said, ‘Let him who is without sin amongst\r\nyou cast the first stone!’\r\n\r\n“All maternity is sacred to the Turk, and every child enjoys full legal\r\nstatus. The super-cowardice of declaring a child as born of ‘parents\r\nunknown’ (as you may in France) could never be allowed. If marriage be\r\nnot the high sacrament it is, theoretically, regarded in Europe, the\r\nlife of _every babe_ whom God sends us is held to be a sacred charge. Do\r\nour missionaries in Turkey really preach the Gospel of Christ?”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Do you approve, or admire, the resignation of the East, the Turk’s\r\nideal of being content with so little?” asked the energetic American.\r\n\r\n“We are _both_ wrong. Their resignation too often leaves life stagnant,\r\nour race for dollars drenches the world in blood.\r\n\r\n“Is it not horrible for us to have to confess that all this appalling\r\nBattle of the Cross against the Crescent, sprang out of greed for oil.\r\n\r\n“One cannot realise what the world would be like were all nations\r\ngoverned by your and my ideals. Would there ever have been a British\r\nEmpire? We can scarcely justify, on grounds of high morality, the\r\nconquest of America; and, surely, the States could by such ruling have,\r\nindeed, become ‘God’s own country.’”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the road became rather more European, our Turkish boy friends\r\nsought to relieve the monotony by a furious race between the two yailis,\r\nand we were tossed about beyond all possibility of further talk. When,\r\nhowever, the boys had won the first heat, I begged to be excused from\r\ntrying to secure our revenge, as the carriages did not seem solid enough\r\nfor racing.\r\n\r\nThen behold, at the word, one of our wheels flew off! And, though we\r\nwere mercifully taking a saunter “between rounds” at the moment, we had\r\nto follow our belongings into the mud and do what we could to help the\r\nwheelwright.\r\n\r\nThe American, I found, had been teaching himself the language, and\r\nclaims to have read _Nasreddin Hodja_ in the original. Now he hastened\r\nto improve the occasion by the most voluble congratulations to our\r\nunmoved drivers. “This wheel evidently knew how to choose the\r\n‘psychological moment’ for its detachment,” he exclaimed. “On the edge\r\nof a mountain, we should all have been pitched into the depths; crossing\r\na river, our lady passenger, who cannot swim, would have been drowned;\r\nduring the race, we could not have avoided a fatal collision. If it had\r\nto happen, it could not have happened more wisely!”\r\n\r\nThe job is finished at last; maybe hastened by such lively chatter; but\r\nI confess we did not feel really secure. In fact, the prudent suggestion\r\nthat one of us should hold the reins while our driver “kept an eye on”\r\nthe wheel was soon justified by a second flying away of that “offending\r\nmember.” It was this time discovered that something must be found to\r\nenlarge the circumference of the axle to keep it fixed, and I\r\nimmediately offered my pocket-handkerchief. Our driver, however, would\r\nnot hear of “depriving me” and so I begged the American “not to disturb\r\nhim, but to see how he would contrive.” Though obviously puzzled for a\r\nfew minutes, he soon justified my confidence by cutting off a good\r\nhandful of hair from the horse’s mane, and thus “fixing” the wheel once\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n“That’s all very ingenious,” laughed my companion, “but ‘hair’ won’t\r\n‘wear.’”\r\n\r\n“Then he’ll find something just as original,” was my triumphant retort.\r\n\r\nNevertheless it was growing dark, and there were rivers ahead that would\r\nseem to demand rather better security than we possessed. My anxieties,\r\nhowever, were soon scattered to the four winds by the most astonishing\r\ntirade of unjust contempt for all things English, in which my companion\r\nnow proceeded to indulge. My anger lasted just long enough for us to\r\ncross the river; for once we were over, the good man explained that he’d\r\ndone it to make me furious, the only way he knew to cure a brave woman’s\r\nfit of nerves.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt last the welcome smoke, rising from peat cottage-fires, brings the\r\ncomforting knowledge that we have almost reached Enichéir; and we are\r\nsoon happily searching for some sort of a resting place that may call\r\nitself “an inn.” We are offered the choice of four beds in a room with\r\nfive others already occupied, or an empty, partially wrecked, sleeping\r\napartment containing two!—one for me, one for the boys, and the American\r\non the floor.\r\n\r\nWe naturally accept the latter, and immediately get busy about some\r\ncooking and a wash. After the day’s roughening experiences one can sleep\r\nwhatever the details of the accommodation!\r\n\r\nAt about 9.30 that evening we are awakened by the police, who, however,\r\nexplain that I am only “wanted” by the Commandant, who has called to\r\nwish me _bon voyage_, and inquire if there is anything he can do for my\r\ncomfort or to speed me on the way.\r\n\r\n“It is not now the Pasha and four wives,” said I, as our visitor soon\r\ndiscreetly left us, “but the Englishwoman and three husbands!”\r\n\r\nNext morning after a pleasant hour of mutual assistance in heating the\r\nwater and holding a looking-glass for each other, with, as I told them,\r\n“the most courtly assistants any woman could desire,” the American goes\r\nout in order to fix that wheel to his own satisfaction and, by\r\ninference, to mine. We have two more days in the yailis and cannot\r\nafford to lose time.\r\n\r\nOur next halting-place is still more primitive, with its four houses,\r\nthe tiny inn, a large stable, and a poultry yard. Here, however, the\r\nMayor is ready to join us, in his long Persian shawl, robe, and turban,\r\nhis documents wrapped in a case of flannel. Like the driver, I notice\r\nthat, as he steps into his seat, he is careful to take off his muddy\r\nshoes. Indeed, the godly cleanliness of Islam, if it does not quite\r\nfollow our Western traditions, is a very real and honest ideal. The\r\nbody, as the cheik had assured me, is clean if the clothes be dirty; and\r\nI am beginning to think that those “little visitors” in the hotel beds\r\nmust really be “suffered in kindness.”\r\n\r\nI well remember the shock with which one of my friends met the\r\nsuggestion that he might drown some of the kittens who were arriving,\r\njust then, with most alarming rapidity. He said, “the Koran would not\r\npermit it!”\r\n\r\nAnother weary day, amidst so much mud and so many ruins, naturally stirs\r\nmy companion to thoughts of what might be done by a few dollars.\r\n\r\n“I do not mind your having any concessions,” I said, “if you will keep\r\nyour hands off the architecture. I was hearing the other day about a\r\nscheme for building a railway in co-operation with the Turks: one rail\r\nto be laid by them and the other by the Americans! I should feel far\r\nmore safe in a yaili with _one_ wheel!\r\n\r\nIt is a delightful pastime to work out big schemes for smashing up\r\nEurope, Asia, and America; in order to rebuild the world tastefully and\r\naccording to hygiene, like a couple of happy children with their bricks;\r\nbut we have at last reached the conclusion of the whole matter. East is\r\nEast and West is West. If they attempt to “take turns” building\r\nrailways, the trains will certainly “go off the line.”\r\n\r\nI have never been able to understand why anyone should be so afraid of\r\nthe Cheriat Laws. With all respect for my present company, I say, what I\r\nafterwards repeated to Sir William Tyrell, “I would rather trust myself\r\nin a Turkish court than appeal to American justice.” In the first case,\r\nyou may find yourself in the hands of a kind-hearted judge; the second\r\nadventure depends entirely on cash. English justice has no equal; but\r\nour laws for women are themselves unjust, and the best workman can do\r\nlittle with poor material. Trials, like marriages in foreign countries,\r\nshould be illegal unless the Consul, or someone equally expert, is\r\npresent to “watch for” his fellow-countryman. What crimes have not we\r\ncommitted in the name of Justice through ignorance of foreign customs!\r\n\r\n“Those who face the choice of trusting themselves to the Cheriat or\r\nkeeping away from Turkey, may find that these laws are not so terrible\r\nafter all,” answered the American.\r\n\r\nZeyneb once said that the great merit of Moslem “Commandments” was the\r\nabsence of mystery. “The i’s are all carefully dotted. We are not told,\r\nfor instance, that we should give to the poor; we _are_ told the precise\r\npercentage of income that must be allotted to charity. Though our laws\r\ncome from the great Prophet of Allah they are not ecclesiastical.”\r\n\r\nIn Moslem countries the Head of the State must be elected by the people;\r\nhe has full executive and legislative power, but he is also personally\r\nresponsible to the nation. We cannot deny that Mustapha Kemal Pasha has\r\nrigidly adhered to this theory of government in his daily practice.\r\n\r\nThis is the true Democracy. Born without any advantages of caste or\r\nfamily, Fethi Bey laughs at all my allusions to “old ancestors.” The\r\nattitude does seem peculiar to Western minds, and may often lead to\r\nconfusion between us, but it is not without charm.\r\n\r\n“How do these very intelligent, modern Turks attempt to reconcile their\r\nzeal for liberal reform with their firm loyalty to Islam? How do they\r\naccount for the decline in prestige and power that none can deny has\r\nbeen their fate?”\r\n\r\n“My friends at the Assembly attribute the temporary fall of Turkey to\r\nthe strong, non-progressive, influence of the hodjas, who have converted\r\nthemselves into a powerful priestly class, as forbidden by the Prophet.\r\nOthers attribute it to ignorance of economics; others to Western\r\nremoulding of Islam, and foreign oppression; others still, to a\r\nperpetual state of war.”\r\n\r\n“What is the Pasha’s personal opinion?”\r\n\r\n“No man,” he says, “can live without complete liberty and full freedom;\r\nnor can any nation. So long as the interests of my own country permit\r\nit, I will be the friend of all nations and all humanity; but when any\r\nnation begins to tamper with our freedom and our independence, as\r\nGermany did in the war, then we can only resist and fight to the bitter\r\nend. I sought to discover my people’s will, and I found they were ready\r\nfor any sacrifice to defend their country. I had faith in the sons of\r\nTurkey, and my faith has justified itself to the utmost.”\r\n\r\n“There has, indeed, been no finer movement among the ‘despised and\r\nrejected’ since the world began.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Here comes my friend the sun,” I exclaimed; “a snow-capped Olympus, the\r\ncypress beneath the azure! Why is our driver using his whip with such\r\nunusual success, just when we want to linger and admire—— Do you know,\r\nmy friend, should I paint this soil, in all its varied tones from ruby\r\nto terra-cotta, all men would cry out, ‘that woman always sees her\r\nTurkey _en coleur de rose_!’”\r\n\r\n“I will bear witness,” laughed my friend.\r\n\r\n“But, seriously,” I went on, “does it not mean iron; rich veins of iron\r\nthat it would _pay_ someone to produce?”\r\n\r\nIn this district of lonely marshland, one can at least rejoice in the\r\ncold for one reason. It has driven away the flies and mosquitoes.\r\n\r\n“Why does not your country find the capital and send over our unemployed\r\nex-service men to help the Turks drain and cultivate these waste lands?”\r\n\r\nWhen I afterwards spoke of the possibility at Lausanne, I was told that\r\n“something might be done!”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow we have reached Broussa, and our young Turks hurry forward to\r\nannounce our arrival to the Governor.\r\n\r\nIt is more trying than ever to lack springs, as we jolt over the loose\r\ncobbles of these primitive and neglected town streets. But I could\r\ncheerfully have put up with far greater discomfort to reach, at last,\r\nthe “luxurious” (in comparison) Hotel Brotte, its glowing fire, can\r\nafter can of water, clean sheets, and the blessed chance of changing\r\none’s clothes and really _brushing_ one’s hair.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE TOMB OF THE SULTAN OSMAN AT BROUSSA.\r\n  p. 272\r\n]\r\n\r\nThis is _not_ the Savoy, but, surely, something better!\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n            A FEW DAYS IN BROUSSA—THE TRUE ISLAM ATMOSPHERE\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Governor who, once more, “comes from Malta,” has detailed a police\r\nofficer to look after me during the five-days’ visit unexpectedly\r\nimposed upon us, since there is no boat leaving before then. My journey\r\nfrom Angora to Constantinople will, therefore, occupy ten days instead\r\nof the regulation two or three.\r\n\r\nWe start out the first thing in the morning and do not return till dusk.\r\nI have never visited so many mosques, and their colouring seems even\r\nmore exquisite than I have found it elsewhere.\r\n\r\nNaturally, however, we first went to pay our respects to the Governor,\r\nwho promised to give me certain special information next day. His konak,\r\nhowever, happened to catch fire soon after we left, and in less than an\r\nhour it was reduced to cinders. There was, fortunately, little wind,\r\nthough, as we watched the flames from our hotel, one could feel no\r\nsecurity that it might not spread all over the town and render us, too,\r\nhomeless.\r\n\r\nIt was, as it happens, a brigand, descending by chance from the\r\nmountains, who had saved the whole town from destruction when the Greeks\r\nleft it in flames, after demolishing their church and setting fire to\r\ntheir houses. Fifteen surrounding villages were, actually, burnt to the\r\nground. The French proprietress of the hotel told me the town was not\r\nravaged by Ottoman Greeks, but by the Hellenes. Their own Greeks cried\r\nbitterly at being compelled to leave, but were terrified into flight,\r\nmany of them dying at Moudania or on the road.\r\n\r\nI heard an amusing story from my Dutch friend in Smyrna which\r\nillustrates in what “great respect” the Turkish army has always been\r\nheld by Greeks. One of their officers, reconnoitring on the hillside,\r\nwas seen to run back to his men, shouting: “They are coming! They are\r\ncoming! There are fezes everywhere!” He had caught sight of a field of\r\npoppies!\r\n\r\nMadame herself is “desolated” by the departure of her Greek servants,\r\nand puts no real reliance on the Jews by whom she has been obliged to\r\nreplace them. Although getting on in years, she is eighty-six, she never\r\ndare go to bed before any of her guests, lest someone should ring and\r\nobtain no answer. I enjoyed examining, in her visiting book, the\r\nsignatures and humorous comments of English prisoners, who were with her\r\nduring hostilities.\r\n\r\nEverywhere the Jews are stirring themselves, in and out of their\r\nquarters, eager to take on anything abandoned by the Greeks, as\r\nshoemakers, plumbers, tradesmen, and labourers of all kinds. Nowhere\r\nelse, I imagine, could one hear them boasting “I am an Israelite.” Our\r\nguests include many Jews, and they are quickly finding their way more\r\nthan ever into the good graces of the Turks.\r\n\r\nI hope they will soon organise the splendid “bathing” one could enjoy at\r\nBroussa if only some comfortable rest-place were set up for recovery\r\nfrom the bracing effects of such strong waters. Surely the Baths of\r\nBroussa might be promoted into a gold mine!\r\n\r\nI wonder if the town is really as old as Angora? In parts it is more\r\ndilapidated, as one can see from walking about its deserted streets, so\r\nsorely in need of repair, and glancing up at the broken windows on every\r\nside. Nevertheless I, personally, delight in the delicate charm of this\r\nfamous Asiatic city, free from a “Levantine” population and the relics\r\nof Byzantium that rather spoil Constantinople.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe celebrated silk factories are not, of course, so picturesque; and\r\nthe depressing mixture of steam heat, and smell is certainly calculated\r\nto make one long for the very latest kind of progressive machinery to\r\nreplace such unhealthy “human” labour. Here, again, we find Jews and the\r\nso-called “Catholics,” have replaced the Greeks; and the proprietors\r\n(who are so often Jews) only complain that there are not more hands\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nThis means, of course, not enough competition; and wages have risen from\r\nthirty to sixty piastres a day. For this reason they miss the Greeks and\r\nArmenians, although the new men are equally good workers.\r\n\r\n“We have also to employ Turkish women,” they say.\r\n\r\n“Are they good?”\r\n\r\n“No, very bad. They _can_ work, but have never done so, and have no\r\nexperience. Yet we must pay sixty piastres for their unskilled labour.”\r\n\r\n“Then you are running the factories at a loss, with these high wages?” I\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n“Oh, no! We ‘make up’ for that by paying the peasants half their old\r\nprice for the raw silk.”\r\n\r\n“Do they complain?”\r\n\r\n“No. We tell them that times are bad; which they understand, and\r\naccept.”\r\n\r\nIt is an excellent example of the ease with which almost anyone can make\r\nhis profit out of the Turk. He is satisfied with so little, and seldom,\r\nor never, protests. For years Greeks and Armenians have filled their\r\npockets at his expense. Now we have driven them out of their homes and\r\nJews are quickly filling their place. No wonder they turn on their\r\nChristian “protectors,” and resent our “interference.” To them money is\r\nthe breath of life, and money is more easily made in Turkey than\r\nanywhere else in the world.\r\n\r\nWhatever prosperity these districts have managed to retain largely\r\ndepends on the silk-making and the tobacco factories. All the Europeans\r\nare, naturally, against any attempts to abolish capitulations. “They are\r\nnot likely to leave us,” say the Turks, “where else would they be\r\ngranted ‘capitulations’?”\r\n\r\nThe bazaar at Broussa has lost none of its Eastern charm, but prices\r\nhave gone up by leaps and bounds since I was here ten years ago. They\r\nwill, probably, soon rise still higher when hand-embroidery dies out\r\nbefore the machine-made imitations.\r\n\r\nThe Central Mosque has been rather disfigured by the over-zealous\r\nmultiplication of mural texts; but the beautiful fountain preserves the\r\nmost marked characteristic of all mosques, on which their “appeal” so\r\nlargely depends. It also contains some very fine specimens of the\r\ncurious old clocks, which only show Turkish hours.\r\n\r\nIn the courtyard there are more fountains and many pigeons, and the\r\npublic letter-writer. Just now he is hard at work for a profitable\r\ncustomer who, one might think, surely knew how to conduct his own\r\ncorrespondence. From my experience as an amateur, doing my best for the\r\n_Poilus_, I should never imagine that letter-writing could be an easy\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\nHow well I remember the poor boy (a particularly serious “case”) who\r\nasked me to “tell Jeanne” that ... “he was well and happy and enjoying\r\nhimself. But that some friends had written and told him she had not been\r\nfaithful, and ‘he didn’t care.’ All the girls were running after him,\r\nand the grand ladies, too. He hadn’t any time to think about _her_.”\r\n\r\nHe afterwards gave me careful instructions about a P.S. “But I do think\r\nof her sometimes.” In another few minutes it was, “I often think of\r\nher.” And, finally, “you can tell her that I forgive her, and love her\r\nas much as ever.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEvery corner of Broussa reveals the true “Islam” atmosphere; whether you\r\nlook down on it from the surrounding heights, or wander along its quaint\r\nstreets and alleys. Everywhere you see latticed windows, mosques, and\r\ndervishes’ Tekké. It stands on a wide stretch of marshland, seemingly\r\ngoing on for ever, with its countless rows of skeleton-poplars, that\r\nstand out in the blue-grey mist like ghostly sentinels.\r\n\r\nI decided there could be no better opportunity to indulge in an\r\nadventure I had often contemplated: climb up the highest of all the\r\nminarets to reach “the top of the top!” The narrow and winding staircase\r\nwas sadly in need of repair; but at the long last I found myself on the\r\ntiny balcony from which the muezzin daily summons “the faithful” to\r\nprayer.\r\n\r\n“Do you think I might sing?” I asked. “It would be interesting to know\r\nhow far the voice carries at this height.”\r\n\r\n“As you please,” he answered; but as it was clear that he was decidedly\r\nembarrassed, if not shocked, I contented myself with quietly humming\r\n_Gloria in Excelsis_. When I told him the words—“On earth peace, to men\r\nof goodwill,” he answered, reverently, “_Inch Allah_.”\r\n\r\n“You see,” I explained, “the muezzin calls the faithful to prayer, I\r\ncall them to peace.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs, perhaps, I ought to have foreseen, it proved a far more difficult\r\nbusiness to get _down_ those steps than it had been to climb _up_.\r\nSomehow the walls seemed closing in upon me, and the mere idea of\r\nstarting upon the descent brought on a fit of unmanageable giddiness. My\r\nguide promptly offered to carry me, but I did not believe it could be\r\ndone; and, in any case, I should not wish him to make the attempt. When\r\nI have plucked up courage to trust my own feet, they are constantly\r\nslipping over the worn stones, and often we find three or four missing\r\naltogether; still it would not be possible to jump.\r\n\r\n“I am only just in front of you,” said my guide, “if you fall, you will\r\nfall on me.”\r\n\r\nI _ought_ to have been thoroughly ashamed of myself, but I could only\r\nsay, “You must let me manage my own way and slide down as best I can.”\r\n\r\nI am perfectly comfortable in an aeroplane at an altitude of 10,000\r\nfeet; and to this day I have never been able to understand why that\r\nminaret made me so giddy.\r\n\r\nWe visited the tombs of Osman and many of the other Sultans buried in\r\nBroussa, the ancient capital of Turkey. The idea of the continual\r\nwatching of the tomb, and, indeed, the whole attitude of Islam towards\r\ndeath, is full of beauty. One does not wish to believe that the Greeks\r\nmarched up to this Holy Place with drawn swords, cursing the founder of\r\nthe Osman Dynasty.\r\n\r\nWe also drove to the famous Green Mosque, immortalised by Pierre Loti.\r\nThe actual colour of this fine building is a most wonderful turquoise\r\nblue; but, like those jewels, it may, indeed, one day grow green with\r\nage. Here Pierre Loti used to write his books, reclining on the\r\nmagnificent carpets, of which the quality and beauty have defied time\r\nitself. On one side stands the large door (replacing the altar) of\r\nexquisitely blended green porcelain and delicate gold lettering; on the\r\nother, the cool and sparkling fountain. All day long he worked in this\r\nhallowed atmosphere; where the invisible mouths of the fountain send out\r\na gorgeous mass of rainbow-hued spray into the sun’s white rays.\r\n\r\nThe guardian of the mosque, who used to serve coffee and bring Loti’s\r\nnarghili and arrange the cushions, has been laid to rest near by; and\r\nnow Loti’s long life is drawing to its close. His best work was done in\r\nthe mosque at Broussa, as his countless admirers should not forget—the\r\nshrine of one of Turkey’s truest friends.\r\n\r\nHere, in the East, all may enter God’s House; and it is here that every\r\nday, all day long, you see (as, indeed, you may in France) men and women\r\nof every sort and condition, unburdening their hearts of joys or\r\nsorrows, some carrying a homely parcel, a loaf of bread, or their goods\r\nto market; others carrying their little children. No doubt, the\r\nmosque—or the church—offers warmth and shelter; but its quiet solemnity\r\nmust turn our thoughts from all the pettiness of existence, the false\r\npride, and the ugly sin. Nor do those who are, as it were, so thoroughly\r\n“at home” in God’s House, pray with any less earnestness or sincerity.\r\n\r\nWhat a contrast to the cathedral at Geneva I visited with a French\r\nex-Ambassadress. We had to send for the caretaker, who _unlocked_ the\r\ndoor for us and _locked it up again_ as we left. Yet this was once a\r\nchurch; holy men had dedicated their genius to make it beautiful,\r\nbecause it was the House of God. It is not God’s House now; only a\r\nbuilding where men meet and speak. “Have we, indeed, lost faith in\r\nanything,” said my companion, as the door was closed behind us “which of\r\nus would God Himself lock out? Are there none left who would pray to\r\nHim? To what vain and untrusting materialism will mankind yet lower\r\ndrift?”\r\n\r\nOne morning, unable to hold in the interest awakened by a handsome,\r\nyoung Turkish woman with veiled hair, who was sitting near me in the\r\nhotel, I, at last, ventured to ask her if she would “excuse my staring,”\r\nbut “she so much reminds me” of an old friend, Dr. Nihat Réchad.\r\n\r\n“He is my brother,” she replied in excellent English, obviously\r\ndelighted. It appears she had lost touch with him for many years; only\r\nknowing that he had been in prison and escaped to join Mustapha Kemal.\r\nNow she hoped he must be coming into his own again.\r\n\r\nI was glad to tell her how greatly we appreciated Dr. Réchad in London.\r\n\r\nOur acquaintance brought me many new pleasures in Broussa, in addition\r\nto her own delightful society and her most friendly baby. She introduced\r\nme to many of the nicest people in the hotel, and arranged for us to\r\nvisit the admirable hospitals of Dr. Nazoum, head of the Army Medical\r\nService, who was a friend of her husband’s.\r\n\r\nThere were two Turkish gentlemen, however (General Kemallidine Pasha and\r\nNourredine Pasha), whom I had been warned _not to see_, because they\r\nwere “such bears and hated England”; naturally, having thus had my\r\ncombative curiosity excited, I eagerly sought for introductions to them.\r\nAnd I could not admit the justice of their condemnation.\r\n\r\nGeneral Kemallidine Pasha is about thirty-five, with an honest, open\r\nface and merry eyes, that strongly reminded me of my brother; who—though\r\nnot wounded _eighteen times_ like the Pasha—has been so frequently sewn\r\nup as to present to the world, so I tell him, no more than a figure of\r\n“threads and patches.” He apologised for offering his left hand,\r\nobviously pleased when I said, “it did not matter which of a hero’s\r\nhands one is privileged to shake.” When I said that I was sorry to hear\r\nhe disliked my country, he gave the only explanation I ever obtained\r\nfrom a Turk: “It is because I once loved her so well!”\r\n\r\nAnd for that I have only one answer, provided for me by Mr. D——, who was\r\nin Constantinople all through the war, and is convinced that the English\r\nwere, throughout, entirely misled by Greek and Armenian dragomen. He,\r\nhimself, would never trust these men to translate any newspaper article\r\nfor him. “Their work may be, and frequently is, quite correct, but they\r\nare clever enough to impart an entirely different _meaning_ from one\r\nlanguage to the other; for example, with the word “iltehoc,” how can\r\nthat word be translated with all its shades of meaning?\r\n\r\n“The most dangerous Englishmen,” he said, “were irresponsible young\r\ncolonels of twenty-five, the familiar “temporary gentlemen,” whose\r\nsudden access to power and responsibility has, on other occasions, led\r\nGreat Britain into adventures she cannot, afterwards, disown. One must\r\nregret, but can scarcely in fairness condemn, some of these brave boys\r\nfrom the “edge of beyond” in Canada or Australia, who, of course, are\r\nabsolutely ignorant of Moslem customs, and, by training, rather\r\naggressively impatient of the slow ways of old England herself.\r\n\r\nThere were Turks of a very inferior type to be found to help them, as it\r\nwould be dishonest to deny. Those who made themselves _personna grata_\r\nto the Allies, and enemies to the Nationalists, because they would sink\r\nto any calumny or blackmail to secure a “job,” or to keep one.\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, high testimony to the personality of General Harington\r\nthat, despite all the crimes committed “in his name,” General\r\nKemallidine, Ismet Pasha and Nourredine Pasha are unanimous in their\r\nhigh tribute.\r\n\r\nOur empire is built on confidence in the “Man on the Spot.” It has given\r\nus our unrivalled position and a reputation for justice and generosity\r\nnone can rival. But, with the wrong men, it may have most disastrous\r\nresults; and, in Turkey, we still want to know _who sent Turkey’s élite\r\nto Malta_?\r\n\r\nKemallidine Pasha gallantly summed up his acceptance of my\r\nexplanations.... “Now I see the difference between an English lady and\r\nan English ‘temporary gentleman’!”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Nazoum has taken us to his office and showed us his delightful\r\nsketches. He also removed some ordinary picture postcards from their\r\nframe to show us his wife’s picture hidden behind them.... “Twelve years\r\nof a life that might have been given to one’s family stolen from me for\r\nthe rough and wandering life of war. Only a photograph. That is my\r\nmarried life.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe also visited Nourredine Pasha’s father-in-law, a dervish living in a\r\nTekké, and revived all my enthusiasm for their wonderful dancing to the\r\nweird piping flute; although these dervishes are, I believe,\r\n“contemplative.”\r\n\r\nI was invited, when at the Assembly, by the Grand Tchelebi to visit\r\nKonia, the chief city of the dancing dervishes, and was much tempted to\r\naccept. I have never fully _understood_ the “mystic dancing,” derived,\r\nas I was told, from our Psalmist’s command to “praise the Lord with\r\ndance and song”; but no one could fail to recognise the fascination of\r\nthe weird rhythm to which the outspread skirts move with a haunting\r\ngrace that is all their own; like gigantic mauve and brown poppies over\r\nthe polished oak floor.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe were unfortunately too late to see much of Nourredine Pasha—the\r\nGeneral was starting on his Inspection. My guide had been too polite to\r\ntell me my watch was slow. The General, however, found time to entrust\r\nme with greetings to General Harington, and to express more hopeful\r\nconfidence in the future relations of our two countries. I am certainly\r\nglad I did not accept anyone else’s judgment of this kind and\r\ndistinguished man. He is, however, a good ten years older than the other\r\ngenerals of the Pasha’s new army whom I have met. I am now quite\r\naccustomed to statesmen and generals of forty.\r\n\r\nI think I must really have seen _everything_ in Broussa, including the\r\nburnt hamlets of the countryside. I remember a school-house in this\r\ndistrict, where the master had been paid in corn, and in which four\r\ngenerations of women, who gave us sweet goat’s milk, were now all living\r\nin one room, tastefully arranged with cushions. They had been swept off\r\nthe face of the earth with the village in which they dwelt, by the\r\nGreeks.\r\n\r\nBut I must not forget the hospital, full of poor women—victims of the\r\nGreeks. If there _were_ such sights at the French Front, I mercifully\r\nescaped seeing them; and here, for the first time, I realised what some\r\nof my sisters have had to endure since the spirit of war has come over\r\nus. Greek hatchets had been at work on Mme. Roufy Bey’s patients; and,\r\nwhether in face or hip, back or leg, too many of these terrible wounds\r\nwere festering, because it had been impossible to attend to them in\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nI remember the mother who once answered her little girl’s natural\r\nquestions by telling her: “You just grew on my heart.” “How lovely,”\r\ncried the child, “is that why mothers all carry the babies so near their\r\nhearts?” “Yes, it is where we keep them.” Here was a poor Turkish mother\r\nwhose little one had been shot as it lay in her arms!\r\n\r\nThrough this devastated area, and having seen the utter destitution of\r\nthese people, I should have expected to find far greater bitterness\r\ntowards the Greeks. But they are well treated in all the prison-camps,\r\nand never handled with brutality as they work on the roads. Yet they\r\nlook rough and desperate, showing none of the resignation with which the\r\nTurk faces captivity, however ragged and tattered. These Greeks even\r\nseem afraid if a Christian woman speaks to them, although they own that\r\ntheir alarm does not come from either a guilty conscience or from terror\r\nof their enemies, but only reveals the broken spirit of men betrayed and\r\nalone. I feel, however, that to be always surrounded by the useless and\r\nhorrible devastation you have yourself inflicted, must unnerve the most\r\ncallous of human beings.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt about six o’clock on our last morning, an officer arrives to conduct\r\nus to the station. The train starts at 7-30, reaching Moudania at nine\r\no’clock, where the boat _may_ leave at 9-30, or any time it likes. It is\r\na short and uneventful train journey, only relieved by a brisk trade in\r\ntea at our two stopping-places.\r\n\r\nWe find a high wind and rough seas at Moudania, and the boat has not yet\r\n_arrived_! There is plenty of time to drive to a unit of headquarters,\r\nwhere the officer’s mother (whom he had “smuggled” through from\r\nConstantinople) gives me coffee and cigarettes beside a welcome fire. We\r\npass the historic house in which Peace was signed; one of the many\r\nexamples in Anatolia of great achievements from small beginnings.\r\n\r\nMoudania is, on the whole, more depressing than any of the miserable\r\ntowns I have been over; and the officer is, certainly, to be\r\ncongratulated on having secured the company of his mother.\r\n\r\nIt was about half-past six in the evening when we were summoned to\r\nembark; and there was no sign of the “special cabin” that had been\r\npromised me in this little cockle-shell of a boat, on which passengers,\r\nnevertheless, are divided according to class. For my part, I chose to\r\ntravel second, as there was far more air; and, as we opened the door,\r\nthe “poultry yard” gave us a hearty welcome! The women had taken their\r\nchickens and rabbits into their berths; the floor was strewn with corn\r\nand lettuce-leaves! As I disliked sharing my bed with poultry, I should\r\nbe happier in the cold outside.\r\n\r\nHowever, the first officer graciously gives up his cabin. It is tiny, by\r\nno means immaculate, and papered with cheerful postcards. But, in the\r\nplace of honour, Queen of Beauty among the ladies of the Levant, hangs\r\nGladys Cooper! I have never so much admired that lovely actress as when\r\nnow she seemed smiling down at my mighty efforts to sleep in this\r\ntiniest of bunks that had been built for someone of half my length and\r\nwidth.\r\n\r\nThe little tub ultimately started at midnight, dancing over the waves to\r\nConstantinople, where Turkish passports are no protection, and I must\r\nnow learn to depend on my credentials from England.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat is going to happen to me? Very possibly my passport will be taken\r\nfrom me, or endorsed with the grim words “not to return to England.”\r\n\r\nMy mission, indeed, was harmless, if not sanctioned. I have, honestly,\r\nendeavoured to see that England may be “a little better” understood by\r\nthe Nationalists in Anatolia. But in fighting Prussianism, we have been\r\nslightly infected by that disease. It has crept into our legislation and\r\nour administration. In free England, Cæsar reigns. We can say, as the\r\nTurks say, “We have _Prussia_ to thank for our distress.”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n CONSTANTINOPLE NO LONGER THE CAPITAL—THE HEART AND SPIRIT OF TURKEY ARE\r\n                                IN ANGORA\r\n\r\n\r\nAS our little cockle-shell reaches the busy quay at Constantinople, the\r\nveiled women collect their animals and carry them through the Custom\r\nhouse. I am the only Britisher, yet the tall, well-built official\r\nrapidly scans my passport and signs it without moving a muscle, or\r\nshowing the faintest surprise at my arrival by _that boat_, not even\r\nopening his lips in reply to my good-morning. Is this army etiquette?\r\nHis kind face has been taught not to unbend. It seems a foolish way of\r\nencouraging foreigners to understand us. “You are not English,” everyone\r\ndeclares, “dear lady, you have too much heart to be English.”\r\n\r\n“We English have hearts,” is my reply, “but, for some reason, we must\r\npretend we have none.”\r\n\r\nSomeone wearing a fez, perhaps a Moslem, insists on taking me to the\r\nhotel, though I assure him that I am quite capable of carrying my little\r\nbag, and a few rugs over my arm. But he has seen Fethi Bey’s letter, and\r\nnothing, clearly, will prevent him from mounting beside the driver and\r\nburdening himself with my belongings.\r\n\r\nAt Tokatlians’ Hotel, however, the Armenian porter handed him the truly\r\nmagnificent tip of two Turkish pounds. He assured me that others pay\r\ndouble that sum for the little trip from the boat to the hotel!\r\n\r\nI see, at once, that there is a difference between Angora and\r\nConstantinople. In Anatolia no one would dream of thrusting his services\r\nupon his country’s friend, or of accepting a two pound tip for so short\r\na ride. My Angora host’s servants could not even be induced to accept a\r\ntip when I left. At Angora there was none of the Levantine haggling over\r\nthe price of a cab. In Constantinople I decided always to leave such\r\nmatters to the porter, who was a kindly man and did his best.\r\nNevertheless, I should seriously advise the Nationalists, when they are\r\nback here, to fix a tariff for luggage and cabs, as the traveller is now\r\nintolerably imposed on.\r\n\r\nThere is compensation, of course, in the return to Western comforts, if\r\nnot luxuries; above all, of the hot bath. I have already taken three;\r\nand they tell me that, if I still don’t feel clean, it is only because\r\nthe water is always brown. One can, further, obtain the services of a\r\nmanicurist, a hairdresser, and a chiropodist, all worthy men; and how I\r\nenjoy these hot-house sitting-rooms, and sheets like satin on the bed! A\r\ntouch of fever and full permission to stay tired, are quite enough to\r\nmake me perfectly content with my one “weary” hat—until my luggage\r\ncondescends to get _un_-lost.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGeneral Harington invited me to the Harbié (British Headquarters);\r\nchiefly, no doubt, to hear about the big men I have seen in Angora.\r\nThere are few Englishmen more keenly interested than he in the\r\npersonalities of the Nationalist leaders, particularly, of course, “the\r\nPasha.” He speaks affectionately of “that nice, honest, fine soldier,”\r\nIsmet Pasha; and describes Refet Pasha as “a very clever man, one from\r\nwhom I have never had an unkind or discourteous word. We are the best of\r\nfriends.”\r\n\r\nI asked him whether “he was _altogether_ in sympathy with the Turks.”\r\n\r\n“You must remember,” he answered, “that I was with General Wilson. No\r\none could have had a finer chief; and no man, I dare to say, could have\r\nfollowed more closely in his chief’s footsteps than I.”\r\n\r\n“Could not our troops be withdrawn, while such an act might still seem\r\n_le beau geste_?”\r\n\r\n“We ought never to have been here,” he replied.\r\n\r\n“It hurts my national pride to see you fine men doing police work.”\r\n\r\nI told him all I had learned about “the Pasha’s” opinion of the\r\nsituation, and asked him when he intended to retire.\r\n\r\n“As soon as I feel really confident that Peace will be ratified.”\r\n\r\n“And Lausanne?”\r\n\r\n“We shall have storms, but the result must be peace.”\r\n\r\n“When?”\r\n\r\n“As soon as we dare hope....”\r\n\r\nI congratulated him on the rôle he had played at Moudania.\r\n\r\n“I am glad,” he said, “to have rendered service to my country.”\r\n\r\n“Can you see any motive for this disastrous policy in Constantinople?”\r\n\r\n“I can only suppose that, for some reason, Mr. Lloyd George simply\r\nrefused to listen to the advice of everyone who knew Turkey, in favour\r\nof friends entirely ignorant of the whole subject. I am almost disposed\r\nto think he did not even consult his own Foreign Minister.”\r\n\r\n“Why did you not go to Lausanne?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Well, I was not invited. Lord Curzon and Ismet Pasha appear to\r\nunderstand each other; and they have clever experts at the Conference.”\r\n\r\n“Do you not feel, however, that a “prejudiced” expert may do even more\r\nharm than the Premier’s ‘men,’ who knew nothing?”\r\n\r\n“If you can prove they are prejudiced, yes.”\r\n\r\n“In my view, when the Turks mistrust them, it is enough.”\r\n\r\n“That, surely, is not for me to say.”\r\n\r\nI much fear it was “mistaken” modesty, which led General Harington to\r\nthink that his presence would “make no difference” at Lausanne.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, his praise of Refet Pasha is well-deserved. It would,\r\nindeed, require an exceedingly smart diplomatist to get over a man no\r\none can bluff, for all his courtesy and kindness. The “wonderful little\r\ngeneral” is always busy, but never _too_ busy to see the friends of his\r\ncountry, who all delight in his wit.\r\n\r\n“There is nothing he would not dare,” said Colonel Mougin. “I can\r\nimagine him smoking a cigarette on the edge of Vesuvius! With a mere\r\nhandful of men he held his own against regiments of Allies all along the\r\nline.”\r\n\r\nWhen I first met Refet Pasha we spoke of Colonel Mougin, with whom he\r\nhad been photographed. I told him that I had been fighting the colonel\r\never since we met.\r\n\r\n“Fighting with that charming man?” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“The charm of friendship is to fight in peace,” I replied, “or _Discuter\r\nsans disputer_, as the French say.”\r\n\r\nHe laughed heartily, and then spoke with the deepest respect of General\r\nHarington.\r\n\r\n“You have yourself given me an example,” said I. “‘Love your enemies’,\r\nas it is written.”\r\n\r\nColonel Mougin used to say that Refet Pasha had the glorious spirit of a\r\npioneer, and that his country made good use of the quality. When he had\r\ncut his way through the wilderness of Anatolia, they sent him to take\r\npossession of Constantinople, though the Allies were still there! At the\r\nsame time, he was to prepare the way for the axe that was once more to\r\nchop with severity, speaking metaphorically, of course, in the departure\r\nof the Sultan. When the Government machine at Constantinople was running\r\nsmoothly, he was sent off to tackle Thrace!\r\n\r\nRefet Pasha spoke warmly of Colonel and Mrs. Samson, not forgetting\r\ntheir charming little girl.\r\n\r\n“He rendered great service to Turkey during the Siege of Adrianople. He\r\nlikes the Turks.”\r\n\r\n“Like all British _gentlemen_,” I interposed, to his amusement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GENERAL REFET PASHA AND COLONEL MOUGIN IN CONSTANTINOPLE.\r\n  p. 288\r\n]\r\n\r\n“Enemies, or not enemies,” he said, “in spite of all the terrible things\r\nyour compatriots have done, they are fine and intelligent men. I\r\nventured to say to them: ‘Perhaps, by bringing every man you can obtain\r\nfrom the four corners of the earth, you may crush our forces, but\r\n_never_ our spirit. And remember, in crushing us you will mutilate\r\nyourselves for ever!’ General Harington knows that. He perfectly\r\nunderstands.”\r\n\r\nThe General spoke of his twenty-eight years’ service: the terrible\r\nhardship of these last years, when they had to fight, not only the enemy\r\nwithout, but those Turks who had thrown in their lot with the Allies.\r\n\r\n“They say,” he went on, “soldiers love war. It is not true. They hate\r\nit, because they know what it means. Politicians want war and make war;\r\nwe only have to obey.”\r\n\r\nHe has a very high opinion of the present Khalif, whom I myself met ten\r\nyears ago, in the days of Mahmoud II.\r\n\r\n“Everybody has the greatest respect for him,” he went on, “and rightly;\r\na fine gentleman and a great artist.”\r\n\r\n“How does he like not being a Sultan?”\r\n\r\n“He is the Khalif,” he replied. “In his place, however, I might prefer\r\nthe lesser honour and the smaller responsibilities.”\r\n\r\n“Do you approve of my going to Lausanne?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“You have worked hard, and honestly, at studying the country and striven\r\nvery sincerely to understand my people. It will be well for your\r\ndelegates to be told the truth. Nevertheless, Lord Curzon himself knows\r\nthe subject inside out. He has made up his mind, and knows exactly what\r\nhe intends to do. Above all, he thoroughly understands what effect his\r\npolicy will produce.”\r\n\r\nI believe every word. This time the Prime Minister will have nothing to\r\nsay; Lord Curzon has _full powers_. His responsibilities are heavy\r\nindeed. With the terrible heritage of “ugly debts” incurred in the name\r\nof England, of which he will personally be held guilty for years to\r\ncome! For him, the _right_ way is not the _easy_ way.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe British officials of Constantinople have been most kind to me; as\r\nthe only Englishwoman who knows the story of Angora, and has been near\r\nto the “heart” of the Turks; they hope I shall go to Lausanne.\r\n\r\nBut who will listen? From the beginning of time, has an Englishman ever\r\nasked a woman for her opinion, or listened to her if she expressed one,\r\neven after being consulted! Often, of course, a personality like Lady\r\nHamilton’s, may exert great influence; but men do not come to us for\r\ninformation or advice on policy however much we may know, however deeply\r\nand clearly we may think. I am still uncertain of how much our women may\r\never be allowed to effect in politics and diplomacy.\r\n\r\nI once heard a story from a witty Frenchman, which “hits off” our _men_\r\nto a miracle! Their stubborn tenacity, which has never _conceded_ an\r\ninch to women that was not dragged out of them by main force! A\r\ncelebrated French Minister once came to London in hopes of securing a\r\ncertain concession. When he had spent an hour explaining his case, our\r\ngreat personages briefly replied: “You might as well have asked us for a\r\npart of Hyde Park!” He tried again, for another hour, with precisely the\r\nsame result. His reasons, any mutual advantages that might, or might\r\nnot, accrue, were absolutely ignored. They only answered, “You might as\r\nwell have asked us for Hyde Park!”\r\n\r\nAt Lausanne, unfortunately, there is every reason to fear that the\r\nEnglish and the Turks are _both_ adopting the method of not listening.\r\nIt works, of course (so far as getting your own way), if _one_ party is\r\nfirmly in possession; but when the claim to control is in dispute, and\r\nneither can be induced to yield, one _must_ feel that a little\r\nconciliation might be prudent.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThinking it most unlikely that I shall have another opportunity of\r\ntalking so freely to any British officials, I have spoken with great\r\nfrankness of what has been in my heart for years, but what I now see can\r\nnever be changed.\r\n\r\nLord Curzon spoke courteously of my self-imposed mission “to serve my\r\ncountry abroad,” but England will never entrust such tasks to women, or\r\neven lend them any _official_ sanction.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is my swan song of the work which I have proved that a woman\r\n_can_ do. Before leaving the stage, I may say what I think.\r\n\r\n“If you suppose that we are going to let any Tom, Dick or Harry run our\r\nEmbassies, as they do in America, you are very much mistaken.” I was\r\nonce “officially” informed: “We may be accused of being socially\r\nexclusive, but everyone knows to which Embassy they should appeal when\r\nanything _has to be done_.”\r\n\r\n“That does not touch my complaint,” I answered. “I shall continue to\r\nresent the fact that _we_ are not allowed the same footing as women in\r\nother countries. We have at last secured the vote, and, theoretically,\r\nthe right of entry to all professions; but, proud as we are of Lady\r\nAstor and Mrs. Wintringham, their presence in Parliament has, rather\r\nunfortunately, produced an impression of far more ‘freedom’ and\r\n‘equality’ than we have actually achieved. Some are indeed safely on the\r\nheights, but most women have not yet even planted their feet on the\r\nlowest rung of the ladder.\r\n\r\n“Everyone knows that the Englishman is chivalrous to women, and is their\r\nsurest anchor in distress. He will willingly die for them, but he\r\nmaintains his rooted objection to being asked to help them to live.\r\n\r\n“The French Government sent a _woman_ to Angora with the fullest\r\nofficial backing in finance and prestige. Their Ambassador provided a\r\nplan for her journey, and has made public acknowledgment of her service\r\nto France.”\r\n\r\n“We do not require women for this work,” was the dogmatic reply; which\r\nalso, of course, ignored the _principle_ involved in such official\r\nrigidity.\r\n\r\nBut with the unfailing courtesy which the best Englishman never denies\r\nto the women whose “interference” he most resents, “I hope you made our\r\nposition clear to your friends the Turks. Those who serve our Government\r\nhave always done so of their own free-will. _That is why we are served\r\nso well!_”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI approached this question from another angle at Lausanne. As I have\r\nalready pointed out, and illustrated from experience in an earlier\r\nchapter, it is most advisable, if not essential, that the Ambassador,\r\nlike other great “Personages,” should employ agents to “try out” the\r\npetty “first steps” of any change in policy.\r\n\r\nI was told by way of reply, that “the first qualification for ‘entering\r\ndiplomacy’ is to be twenty-one!” This, of course, excludes a woman over\r\nthirty; a fact that may serve for answer to many bitter attacks upon my\r\n“Disadvantage of Being a Woman.” A man of threescore is seldom\r\nconsidered too old for diplomacy; a woman of thirty-five is fourteen\r\nyears beyond the limit.\r\n\r\n“What would you do with the old men?” I was asked.\r\n\r\n“Teach them golf,” was my prompt retort.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the Front in a French uniform, speaking French to my own compatriots,\r\nI was always unwilling to confess my nationality. So long as they\r\nthought I was French, they forgot the lady, and made a friend of the\r\nwoman! Shedding their “own” uniform, as it were, they “let go” in homage\r\nand devotion; giving, being, and appealing for _themselves_. But the\r\nmoment it came out that I was English, the open oyster closed down and\r\nhid its pearl. From these spruce, upright, and tightly-buttoned uniforms\r\nI could never get through the politeness.\r\n\r\nAs an interpreter in the Guards once explained it: “When one of your\r\nGenerals asks me to buy him a _Vie Parisienne_, he never forgets to add,\r\n‘but don’t give it to me in front of my officers.’” It must be the same\r\nwith women. The Englishman will allow a _French_ woman to “have a peep”\r\nat his soul. To his compatriot he offers his dignity and his\r\nprestige—which are no better than a bag of bones!\r\n\r\nWhat I have always known, has been brought home more forcibly than ever\r\nduring this trip. In matrimony, at his office, and in the home, the\r\nEnglishman must be master. We can, if we must, accept a _good_ master.\r\nWho will help us against the _bad_? Do the _Laws_ of England?\r\n\r\nIt sometimes seems indiscreet for an Englishwoman to visit the British\r\nEmbassies in foreign capitals, but I rarely omit to call on the French;\r\nand there are, of course, certain advantages, under some circumstances,\r\nin a twin-nationality. I have been invited to their Christmas lunch by\r\nGeneral and Madame Pellé.\r\n\r\nMr. Neville Henderson, the British _chargé d’affaires_ at\r\nConstantinople, though certainly not pro-Turk, does not hesitate to\r\ncriticise the Greeks. An ideal sense of balance for a diplomat.\r\n\r\nThe Turks like Mr. Henderson; and when I remarked on the apparent\r\nanomaly that “one can be popular in Turkey without being pro-Turk,” I\r\nwas met by the astounding retort that “he succeeds because he knows how\r\nto talk”—a strong argument against “silent” diplomacy!\r\n\r\nI can only hope that he may long remain at his post. Although he may not\r\nlike to hear his beloved Foreign Office called a “mausoleum,” or the\r\nburial-ground for twentieth-century ideals. Of him, one can repeat what\r\na Cabinet Minister once said of France: that “he is one of the few ready\r\nto give a criminal, or a genius, _his chance_.” Though not an enthusiast\r\nfor any “Asiatic Revival,” he will accept the inevitable, and cheer the\r\nwinner. May he stay at his post _at least_ till danger is past.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have just made my first, and I hope my last, stay in Pera. The\r\nsister-in-law of my little Turkish sister is dying, so I cannot accept\r\nher hospitality, though she has begged me to come to her.\r\n\r\nWhat a terrible warning one can take from Pera! I had not realised the\r\ndanger of losing oneself in the ambition to be truly cosmopolitan. These\r\npeople belong to all nations and have the souls of none. Their faces\r\nhave only one common feature—the lack of the spirit behind all racial\r\ntypes, the entire absence of any ideal. In Anatolia I found two forms of\r\ninborn honour: the “nationalist” and the “primitive peasant.” In Pera I\r\nstepped from Tokatlian’s Hotel to the Embassy with the feeling that\r\nsomeone is going to stab me in the back.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis is the fourth Christmas I have spent in Turkey. On the first\r\noccasion the Germans invited me to their Christmas Tree; outside some\r\nArmenians sang their exquisite native carols; which, like their\r\nfolk-songs, make one wish their characters were equally fine. The\r\nconcert, however, was interrupted by the master-scavengers of\r\nConstantinople, the innumerable dogs, against whose furious barking the\r\nChristians at first bravely held on. But the “enemy” trotted away to\r\ncollect his forces from every quarter of the city and, in the end, I won\r\na wager for the dogs _versus_ the Christians. Our entertainers went\r\nhome, amidst a never-to-be-forgotten chorus of canine howling.\r\n\r\nIn Constantinople the dogs certainly had their own nationality. Divided\r\nagainst each other by street feuds, the biggest troop coming from the\r\n“station beat,” where cans of rubbish are emptied from the Orient\r\nexpress, they yet _united_ to drive out the “alien” Christians from the\r\nfatherland of “Dogdom!”\r\n\r\nAnd so it is with the Moslems. If Albania and Syria have left their\r\nfatherland, it is not wise for a foreigner to utter a word against\r\nTurkey in their presence.\r\n\r\nMustapha Kemal Pasha will find no difficulty about proving his\r\nconfidence in Nationalism. “If Europe deny us justice, we shall obtain\r\njustice from Asia The brotherhood of Islam stands solidly for us.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis Christmas, after a pleasant dinner at the hotel with Mr. D——, I\r\nasked him to take me to church. “Can you hold on to Faith after what you\r\nhave seen?” he asks.\r\n\r\n“I have sometimes nearly lost hold. But when I realise that ‘war’ has\r\ntaken away everything else from us, I just _hang on_, hard.”\r\n\r\nSo I go to church alone, leaving the hideous jazz-band and the noisy\r\ndancers; who drink and step out like kangaroos by way of enjoyment!\r\n\r\nThe eternal beauty of the midnight Mass carries one right away from the\r\ndreadful tragedy of life, handing us, too, spiritual food for the\r\nheart’s strengthening. On the way home I was humming the Christmas hymn,\r\n“Come and Adore Him,” when a clash of discord struck at me from the\r\napproaching hotel-mob; for _their_ part, humming “_j’en ai marre_” (“I\r\nam fed up”) the most contagious refrain ever uttered.\r\n\r\nI, very unreasonably, poured out my wrath on Mr. D—— next morning. “Is\r\nit impossible to make them realise what their song _means_? Nero fiddled\r\nwhile Rome was burning; they are dancing to the tune of a poor woman’s\r\nbroken heart. Someone will soon find a gay air for “the Song of the\r\nShirt,” and men will be hopping and braying to it.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt last I am, fortunately, able to drive quietly away from Pera. “You\r\nhaven’t changed a bit, you always disliked Pera,” my little Turkish\r\nsister had said. “I remember that when we used to go to the Ottoman Bank\r\nto fetch your letters you would have the horses whipped up so as to ride\r\nto Pera and back as quickly as possible.”\r\n\r\nAgain I am gazing upon the “Sublime Porte.” It is still “sublime” and\r\nthe sunset has not changed. Yet no longer can it command my love; and\r\nwoman does not reason!\r\n\r\nThe old buildings are as magnificent as ever; the sun is still sparkling\r\non the gold; the picturesque beggars are still there; the blue sky, the\r\nBosphorus, and the cypress trees!\r\n\r\nOnly the heart and spirit of Turkey have gone to Angora. This is no\r\nlonger the Turkey of the Turks; and so I am a stranger here, and there\r\nare no friendly faces of the Anatolians to give me greeting.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlong the road the same houses are tumbling down, at exactly the same\r\nstage of decrepitude. “Nothing has changed, my child,” I say, “except my\r\nheart.”\r\n\r\nAs we pass the old Tekké, however, I miss the kindly face that used to\r\nsmile on me from behind the green grilled window; and we laugh over the\r\ncurious souvenirs I managed to obtain from that holy man.\r\n\r\nI was walking with Colonel Z., ten years ago, the first day I noticed\r\nhim at the window; the big, lovely, dark eyes; the green swathed turban;\r\nthe Persian robe; and on his face the look of the “peace that passeth\r\nunderstanding.” He must be the “Sower that went forth to sow,” I said,\r\n“please take me in to him.”\r\n\r\n“But I cannot,” said the colonel; and so, before he realised what I was\r\ndoing, I just walked in myself and told the holy man that “I had come to\r\nlook at his ‘beautiful face.’” After that I paid him many visits,\r\nsharing his coffee, making signs to the women, and watching his strange\r\nworship, that had not even any accompaniment of the piping flute.\r\n\r\nHe told me that no Christian had ever before been admitted into the\r\nTekké.\r\n\r\n“Do you consider me a heathen?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“No, we are all children of God. How can one of His children be a\r\nheathen?”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“What has become of the old man?” I asked my Turkish sister.\r\n\r\n“They ordered his son—you remember that fine lad—to say _Vive la Grèce,\r\nVive Venizelos_, and when he refused, they shot him.”\r\n\r\n“But what of the old man?”\r\n\r\n“It broke his heart. One day he just fell asleep and did not wake\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\nThe harem door is still open. The little daughter, now thirteen, still\r\ncalls me Tezajim (dear Aunt), and we find seats on the marble veranda to\r\nwait for the sun to set over the shores of the Marmora.\r\n\r\n“How often I think of you,” murmured my little sister, “trying and\r\ntrying, day after day, to paint our sunset.” And when I repeated that to\r\nthe late Sir Alfred East he laughed heartily, saying, “Dear child,\r\nTurner could not have done it?”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd who has taken the place of my attendant, Miss Chocolate? The slim\r\nfigure of a coal-black negress appears to answer my question, robed in\r\nbrown velvet, with a brown velvet toque. I must call her Miss Ink,\r\nthough her name is Mary.\r\n\r\nI lunch with my Turkish sister as often as the poor sick woman can spare\r\nher, and she is generous. Yet eighteen of her friends are there already.\r\nThis time my friend wears a fur coat and a black veil with lace over it.\r\n“Fancy calling _that_ a veil, I teased her. Yet I can count the steps\r\ntaken in the progress of Turkish women by our lunches. The first time I\r\ncame to Turkey, you wanted to go up in a lift, and though your father\r\nsaid neither ‘yea’ nor ‘nay,’ you did not go. The second time you often\r\nused the lift. The third time, we lunched at Tokatlian’s restaurant,\r\n‘for ladies only.’ Now you lunch unveiled (I don’t call _that_ a veil)\r\nin a _mixed_ restaurant.\r\n\r\n“And yet, now you have won the privilege for which you have been waiting\r\nso many years, you prefer to lunch ‘with the ladies.’ How like a woman!”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\n   LAUSANNE PALACE HOTEL—THE HOME OF TURKEY, FRANCE, AND JAPAN—“EVERY\r\n              POSSIBLE PHASE OF COMPLETE INTERNATIONALISM”\r\n\r\n\r\n“PLEASE reserve comfortable room for Englishwoman coming from Angora,”\r\nso ran the telegram despatched by an American friend of mine, who had\r\ngallantly determined that I should be well looked after. It was both\r\ncomfortable and warm; and, to complete the welcome, my waking eyes next\r\nmorning are caught by the two flags I have learnt to love so well, the\r\nTurkish and the French—the “standards” of two brave peoples, with the\r\nfine spirit that nothing can subdue, who would choose rather to be\r\nannihilated than to live in servitude.\r\n\r\nThen I notice the flag of Japan! “What has Japan to do with it?” I ask\r\nIsmet Pasha.\r\n\r\n“Ah, Miss d’Angora,” he answers with a laugh, “it is fine sport to watch\r\nthe poor little bird as they pluck out his feathers and clip his wings.”\r\n\r\nIndeed, Lausanne has been “revolutionised” by this Conference of Peace!\r\nIt is a golden harvest for the hotels, which have not a room unoccupied.\r\nEvery day luncheons, dinners, and banquets! Everywhere representatives\r\nof the world’s Press! I feel strange, somehow, in a “neutral” country.\r\nEver since 1914 I have been living, or travelling, over “seats of war,”\r\nin lands fighting to defend, or attack, an Ideal.\r\n\r\nOne can respect any sort of an “opinion” from some point of view; but\r\n“neutrality” and “anonymity” do not sound to me like attributes in which\r\na free and independent people should feel much pride. Yet the\r\n“neutrality” of Switzerland means the _International Red Cross_ and the\r\n_League of Nations_; and it has surely earned by its hospitality to the\r\nworld’s statesmen, a right to play _its_ part in the historical peace,\r\nfor which “the God who Forgives” is waiting.\r\n\r\nThe Orient express is bringing the peoples together; Lord Curzon\r\nfrom London, Ismet Pasha from Angora. May their political discussion\r\ntravel under one company to our home of peace! This Hotel of the\r\nStrange Tongues is fast become a very Tower of Babel, for it reveals\r\nevery possible phase of complete internationalism, from fox-trots\r\nand cocktails to the folk-songs of Anatolia, sung by the Pasha’s\r\nGuards when off duty. Here, too, are thronging a host of new\r\nnationalities—Georgians, Bolsheviks, Syrians, Sons of Palestine, and\r\nArmenians; each fired by their own ideals, each proud of their\r\nindependence; all sighing for the (political) moon.\r\n\r\nFor the moment, of course, the Conference has resolved itself into a\r\nduel between Lord Curzon and Ismet Pasha. Mme. B., indeed, is indignant\r\nbecause, she says, “our English representative has so bullied the French\r\ndelegate that he has been obliged to take to his bed,” though one can\r\nhardly believe that proud and mighty Republic would choose a man whom\r\nanyone could really bully to bed!\r\n\r\nI tried to imagine the Conferences of the future! “We should appoint a\r\nbear for our delegate,” I said, “send him round to all the other\r\ndelegations in turn, to grunt! When his confrères had all taken to their\r\nbeds, he could dictate his own term.... After the senile sensitiveness\r\nof M. Barrère, the youthful ‘insolence’ of Riza Nour is most\r\nrefreshing.”\r\n\r\nThis is the first occasion of big diplomacy in which Turkey has ever\r\ndared to assert herself. “A free and independent Turkey” is so unheard\r\nof; one sadly fears it may even now be dismissed as “mere bluff.” Do\r\nthey realise, or will they ever believe, that a vast, well-trained army\r\n(who _may_ be called fanatics) are _ready_ and _thoroughly prepared_ (by\r\nmilitary experts) to come out at a word from their great leader, and\r\nonce more save their Fatherland? It is sad to feel that the “Hymn of\r\nIndependence” I heard on all sides at Angora, should sound as much “out\r\nof harmony” with the tone of the Conference, as “Anatolian” folk-songs\r\nwith a Jazz Band!\r\n\r\nAmerica has sent “representatives,” whose chief is called _An Observer_\r\nand rejoices in the name of _Child_—“The Child Observer” or, as it is\r\nwhispered, “The Boy Scout.” To point the humour of the situation, I\r\nnaturally expected to meet a hoary-headed old gentleman with a long\r\nwhite beard, like his predecessor at Rome, Ambassador Robert Underwood\r\nJohnson. But though I was not aware of it at the time, he is the very\r\nyoung man I reduced to silence, by inquiring the way in what he called\r\nvoluble French, who simply led me to the place without comment, rang the\r\nbell, and went away!\r\n\r\nAt the Conference one still sees the Powers in turn calling Turkey “to\r\norder,” when their own arrogance has reduced her delegate to a condition\r\nof what the Press calls his “more than usual insolence.” Then the “Boy\r\nScout” or “Child Observer” would “try a little kindness,” to Ismet\r\nPasha. “Don’t you see the whole world is against you,” to which came the\r\ndignified rejoinder, “We have become accustomed to that.”\r\n\r\nAs it was in Angora, everyone here talks politics all day. But I am told\r\nthat, while they only enjoyed themselves at Genoa, they do work at\r\nLausanne. I quite believe in this “work”; certainly the Turkish\r\ndelegates are hard at it till two or three every morning. But they do\r\nnot forget enjoyment altogether. The younger members from the\r\ncommissions have treated themselves to a _thê dansant_. “It warms your\r\nfeet,” said Hussein Djahid, who takes his dancing very seriously.\r\n“Surely Turks don’t suffer from cold feet,” I exclaimed, “and I don’t\r\nbelieve you really like it, you only dance to show us that you can\r\n_dance_.”\r\n\r\nThe Press is luxuriously installed in a miniature palace of its own, at\r\nthe Palace Hotel; a bar, of course, a gramophone, a perfect\r\ndancing-floor, roulette, and, incidentally, “plenty of room to write.”\r\nMr. Ward Price politely regrets that “etiquette” will not permit him to\r\nask me for an interview. Why should newspaper etiquette be allowed to\r\nhamper his “duty” as a good sportsman?\r\n\r\nTo the one journalist who really counts at Lausanne (though his articles\r\nwere not always printed), I ventured to bring grave charges against the\r\nPress. “How is it men of talent and education have allowed themselves to\r\nsink to the level of mere machines, that any ‘big’ proprietor can use to\r\nmanipulate public opinion? The ‘Power of the Press’ is a fraud. You\r\nnever give us the benefit of your knowledge and judgment; whether we\r\ntake a ‘pennyworth of news,’ or let ‘bang go saxpence.’ ‘Alas,’ said\r\nShakespeare, ‘to choose love by another’s eyes!’ Is it not a hundred\r\ntimes worse ‘to write by another’s ears?’”\r\n\r\nYou write only what Mr. MacClure deigns to approve; and, though\r\ndoubtless honest and unbiassed, he is not himself really “free.” He\r\nfeeds you daily, like the animals in Regent’s Park, and, after a good\r\nnight, you may digest the food. It would be far more honest to issue an\r\n“official” Report, without the “false” impression of personal judgments\r\nformed on the spot, which a “special correspondent” is meant to produce.\r\nThe public is taught to laugh at Ismet’s pleasantries, via Mr. MacClure!\r\nNow I have heard the Pasha rehearsing, and Lord Curzon preparing his\r\n“part”; but I still want to witness the duel upon the public platform,\r\n_for myself_.\r\n\r\nCould one ever forget the most dramatic moments of the Second Conference\r\nat the Hague! Can such incidents be reported unless one has actually\r\nseen them! I remember Mr. Choate was down one afternoon to speak on\r\nDisarmament. As he rose, Baron Marshall von Bieberstein deliberately\r\nclosed his ears, and opened a sheet of paper and began to write. Drawing\r\nhimself up to his commanding height, with a stern air of dignity, Mr.\r\nJoseph Choate began—“I have prepared my speech with great care for the\r\nexpress benefit of Baron Marshall. If the _noble_ gentleman is too busy\r\nto “listen” this afternoon, he would, perhaps, be good enough to make\r\nanother appointment!” Surely the fine picture of this grand American\r\ncalling the “noble” Baron to order upon a question of good breeding is\r\none which each correspondent must see, hear, and describe for himself.\r\n\r\nIt is, no doubt, largely due to the great difficulty of obtaining first\r\nhand news, that most people are anti-Turk. We were told, for example,\r\nthat Riza Nour was “insolent”; whereas he had patiently listened for\r\nhours to nonsense about the “National Armenian Home,” _before_ he left\r\nthe Conference room in despair of being permitted to tell the truth.\r\n\r\nAnd, partly no doubt because they may not comment upon anything of real\r\nimportance, the papers are always ready to enlarge upon some trivial\r\ndetail that is calculated to fan the flames of hate, or point the finger\r\nof scorn, towards any Turk. Someone asserted that the Turkish military\r\nexpert had made a little mistake in preparing a map. He himself did not\r\nadmit that he was wrong; but in any case, no one pretended that the\r\nmatter was in the least important; and it could, ultimately, be\r\nrectified without the slightest effect on policy. Remember, too, that\r\nthe poor man was working from surveys prepared on different systems, and\r\nin a language that describes everything for us backwards. It would not\r\nbe remarkable if some slight error _were_ made in transposing the\r\ndetails to European measures and methods. Yet the papers all give\r\ncolumns exposing the “little mistake,” which, most probably, was never\r\nmade. Vital questions, meanwhile, were almost entirely ignored in the\r\nPress; and the “insolent” Asiatics are filled with bitter resentment. It\r\nis idle for Mr. MacClure to say that “they must expect criticism.” What\r\nthey complain of is not “criticism,” but the entire “ignoring” of their\r\npoint of view—a very different thing.\r\n\r\nThe journalist whom I thus attacked admitted that they deserved all I\r\nsaid. “The public,” he added, “_has_ been misled, one might say\r\n‘cheated.’ I _could_ myself have supplied a good deal of first-class\r\ninformation, sufficiently dramatic and interesting to ‘raise\r\ncirculations’; had I refused my signature to the ‘official’ news so\r\nsparingly doled out for me to put into shape. I can promise you that, on\r\nme at least, your words have not been wasted.”\r\n\r\nLet us hope he may substantiate his pledge. At present the Press is\r\nneither a critic, a check on intrigue, nor an inspiration. It echoes the\r\nGovernments, good or bad. In Constantinople, for instance, the American\r\nand English “special correspondents” frankly confessed that they employ\r\na few “scouts” to collect copy, and merely “hash up” what comes in from\r\nthese “scavengers” of rumour and gossip.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPropaganda in the Turkish Press is under the direction of Kemal Bey (the\r\npoet) and Ruchène Echref. Men of such literary distinction, alas, are no\r\nbetter fitted for such work than a watchmaker would be to heave coal. In\r\nTurkey they do not understand how heavy are the hands that can mange\r\npropaganda: that posts are created for the men who can fill them, and\r\nmen are not made for any post that may happen to be vacant.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was always a pleasure, _and_ a surprise, to meet Lord Curzon socially\r\nat Lausanne; and if only his traditional respect for British prestige\r\nwould have allowed him to be “himself” with Ismet Pasha and the Turkish\r\ndelegates, to approach discussions with all the charm and wit that he\r\nknows so well how to exert, I am convinced that the _practical_ gain to\r\nboth countries would be enormous.\r\n\r\nFor though in debate his “official” manner is bound to emphasise the\r\nimpression of a determined man, so clearly knowing his own mind that\r\nargument or even discussion is waste of time; I found him sincerely\r\ninterested in all the personal details of my trip; and his penetrating\r\nquestions were proof enough that he is quite ready to hear all sides,\r\nand really anxious to understand the country, the people, and their\r\npoint of view, from anyone who knows them, irrespective of what\r\n“heresies” they may uphold. To me personally, he was not only courteous,\r\nbut respectfully attentive; the only Englishman whose compliments and\r\npraise _meant_ a real gratitude, a serious acknowledgment of my fifteen\r\nyears’ study and adventure, as “worthy service to my country.”\r\n\r\nIsmet Pasha asked me if I had succeeded in making Lord Curzon understand\r\nthe grave importance of their movement.\r\n\r\n“I may have helped a little,” I answered, “I believe I have. But he has\r\nalways understood nearly the whole truth. What I fear _you_ and your\r\nfriends must find it almost impossible to understand is the “public\r\nopinion” in the West, which he cannot ignore.\r\n\r\n“Does he know how foolish it is to talk of a “home” for Armenia?”\r\n\r\n“He knows it would be as useless as to tie ‘a swarm of bees under a\r\ndonkey’s nose.’ But, though—as you justly say—it is not their business,\r\nEngland cannot ignore America and the Powers. It would not bring you\r\npeace, or justice, to affront them. I do not wonder that you and Riza\r\nNour grow impatient with the wasteful methods of traditional diplomacy;\r\nbut that is _our_ way of democracy, to conciliate public opinion by a\r\npose of far greater obstinacy and intolerance than we feel, or intend to\r\nact on.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe in England, however, should realise that, however wise and sincere\r\nLord Curzon’s own sympathy may be, the general attitude—in England and\r\nthe Continent—is still based on our interpretation of the “old” Turkey.\r\nOur experts, for example, in Constantinople, still approach the\r\nNationalists as they were accustomed to order about Abdul Hamid’s Turks.\r\nThey are, naturally and inevitably, “touchy” in Angora, but we shall not\r\nhelp matters by any offensive allusions to the “Moslem with his tail up,\r\nno thank you!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  LAUSANNE PALACE HOTEL.\r\n  THE HOME OF TURKEY, FRANCE, AND JAPAN.\r\n  p. 304\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt would be not only wiser and fairer, but more dignified, to\r\ncongratulate these people on the achievements of the Grand National\r\nAssembly, which the “Mother of Parliaments” should surely welcome with\r\nhonour and respect.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI found Ismet Pasha often depressed by the immensity of his task;\r\nharassed, too, lest his own people should not feel that he had done\r\nenough. “They have sent me, a soldier, to fight a Bismarck, one of your\r\ngreatest statesmen,” he said one day.\r\n\r\nI repeated what Lord Curzon had told me, with obvious sincerity, “You\r\nknow, I _like_ the little man.”\r\n\r\n“And I respect _him_,” was the prompt reply, as his bright eyes lit up\r\nwith renewed hope and courage.\r\n\r\nAnother day he was again in despair. “Well, it will just _have_ to be\r\nwar.”\r\n\r\nBut I would not hear the word. To all the Turks, Riza Nour, Tewfik,\r\nHikmet, I say the same. “We are both in the wood. We must walk round and\r\nround, until we have found a way out.”\r\n\r\nIt may sound paradoxical, but, while there is absolutely no offence to\r\nBritish prestige in the National Pact that is worth shedding one drop of\r\nhuman blood to remove, it yet stands for such vital ideals, means so\r\nmuch, and has been achieved with such grand courage and self-sacrifice,\r\nthat the Nationalists must uphold and defend it to the bitter end. That\r\nis the “problem” of Lausanne.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, no reason why, if foreigners are afraid to trust\r\nthemselves, and the capital, in a Turkey governed by Turks (without\r\n“protection,” which means “interference”) they should not leave the\r\npeople to find their own way towards commercial and political stability.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLord Curzon, naturally, _told_ me nothing; but his questions enabled me\r\nto guess at what he wished and intended to achieve. Perhaps I have\r\nguessed wrongly.\r\n\r\nIs he not anxious to keep Mosul, from fear of Russia. We could buy the\r\noil, and the Turks would gladly sell it. Also a promise to Arabs has\r\nbeen broken before now; and if our bungling has led Turkey into a\r\ntemporary alliance with Russia, no one knows what will come of the\r\nGerman-Jew Soviets. Maybe, we have far more need to protect India from\r\nthem, than to stand on our dignity with “new” Turkey.\r\n\r\nThe British Empire was founded, and can only survive, on Trust. It is a\r\npoor policy that dare not act for fear of backing “the wrong horse.” It\r\nis a criminal policy, when hesitation means war and the loss of millions\r\nof lives.\r\n\r\nLord Curzon’s association with the Coalition has sadly shaken his high\r\nrepute for “good faith”; and unless he can see his way to come forward\r\nfrankly for a “free and independent” Turkey, the Nationalists will fight\r\nin their own defence.\r\n\r\nThere seem to me too many “Commissions” at Lausanne. Closer contact\r\nbetween Lord Curzon himself and those able men, Djavid and Hamid Bey, as\r\nwell as Ismet Pasha, would surely not only go far to restore their\r\nconfidence in his good faith, but enormously “speed up” decisions on the\r\n_essential_ problems that need to be promptly settled.\r\n\r\nAs I listened to the public speeches of Lord Curzon I was haunted by all\r\nthe fateful memories of the ruin I had seen in Angora. The doubt _would_\r\ncome; does he really realise the supreme necessity to wipe out for ever\r\nthat awful page of history, to _establish_ peace, and to _help_, with\r\nall the tactful sympathy at his command, the new nation to stand on its\r\nown feet. Maybe we should even be comforted by hope, if our Government\r\nwould only take us more fully into its confidence. The people of England\r\nare, after all, deeply concerned. They have faith, they would gladly be\r\nloyal; but why are they kept in the dark? When I am speaking with the\r\nTurkish delegates, I sometimes fancy I catch a look on their faces of\r\n“deep anguish” as we name Lord Curzon, and my heart sinks. How am I to\r\nconvince them, certain as I am he is right, that he is not drifting\r\ntowards the false “sentiment” that has been broadcasted to uphold the\r\nGreeks?\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the anniversary of the In-Eunus, I dined with Ismet Pasha. When he\r\nrefused dates I told him that, “so long as he kept the ‘dates’ of his\r\nvictories, he needed no others.” “I left Constantinople with nothing,”\r\nhe answered. “I returned the head of the Army.” Turkey gives every man\r\nhis chance.\r\n\r\nSo far as possible, I am dividing my time between British and Turks; and\r\nno one can say that either gives more time or “hard labour” to their\r\nresponsibilities, than the other. It is not possible, certainly, for any\r\nvisitor to interrupt Lord Curzon, he seems to be working all the time.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is one figure we all watch carefully at the Conference. I once\r\ncompared the face of M. Venizelos to an Apostle! Now he hovers round the\r\nBritish Delegation like a bird of ill-omen, for some inexplicable reason\r\nstill mesmerising our diplomatists, carrying trouble wherever he goes.\r\nDjavid Bey laughs to remind me of how proud I had once been to pour out\r\ntea for them both!\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne naturally feels great interest in Melle Stanciof, as the first woman\r\ndiplomatist, and her personality repays study. Tall and thin, with the\r\nlarge eyes of the Oriental, she is very able, speaks English without an\r\naccent, and loves her work. I repeated to her the dogma that to be\r\ntwenty-one is an essential qualification for a diplomat; but she is\r\ntwenty-seven, and only laughed at the idea.\r\n\r\nSir Wm. Tyrell, Permanent Head of the British Foreign Office, with all\r\nhis Irish charm and wit, is as clever as Machievelli. He delights in\r\ncalling himself “Chief of the Underlings”; but men like Mr. Forbes Adam\r\nand Mr. Harold Nicholson were experienced diplomats when their Turkish\r\ncolleagues were in their cradles; which, as Ismet Pasha sometimes\r\ncomplains, “gives them no chance for a fair fight.” But when I dined\r\nwith them as his guests, there was no fighting; and our host, I felt,\r\nwas very well qualified to promote friendly relations, by the cultured\r\nease of his hospitality.\r\n\r\nTo my thinking, British “underlings” are very able men, and not\r\npro-Russian as the Turks are disposed to fear. They were all anxious for\r\npeace, and quite sincerely eager to understand the nationalist point of\r\nview.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the conference both M. Poincaré and M. Mussolini visited Lausanne\r\nand dined with Lord Curzon.\r\n\r\nI have had many talks about the Patriarch, whom Mustapha Kemal declares\r\nmust be removed: “He must be got rid of, with the other relics of\r\nByzantium!” The problem is especially hard on Turkey, because it arose\r\nfrom what ought to have been considered the great strength of the\r\nnation, though—in this case—it has been exaggerated into weakness, her\r\nimmense tolerance for other people’s religion.\r\n\r\nWhen the Byzantians conquered the Turkish tribes who had emigrated into\r\nAsia Minor, they compelled the tribesmen to be converted, and join the\r\nOrthodox Church. The Bible, and all their prayers, were translated into\r\nTurkish; whence, without design, the Turkish Orthodox Church came into\r\nbeing. When, later, under the Seldjoucides and Osmanli, Anatolia passed\r\ninto Moslem hands, no attempt was made to interfere with the Orthodox\r\nreligion of the people.\r\n\r\nIt was only when the Ottomans ruled in Constantinople and the Sultans\r\nused their growing power to support the Greek Patriarch, that the\r\nAnatolians began to see they were being manœuvred into the power of the\r\nHelenes. During the war, the Patriarch’s intrigues became more daring\r\nand more obvious; until Papas Eftim Effendi proposed in the Assembly\r\nthat Fanar should be separated from the Orthodox Church, and that the\r\nOrthodox Church of Anatolia should rule in Thrace and Constantinople.\r\n\r\nYet when Ismet Pasha spoke of the religious “tolerance” of Turkey, Lord\r\nCurzon replied: “How can you claim to be tolerant. All your past record\r\nwill be destroyed if you dismiss the Patriarch.” And rather than risk\r\nsuch a charge against the Nationalists, he gave way.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me, I confess, that this concession is a grave risk. The\r\ninterference, thus permitted, may prove to be more disastrous than that\r\nof a few foreign judges against which they so resolutely protest. As Mr.\r\nNicholson said he hoped that I had told Lord Curzon how much the Turks\r\nwere giving up.... “I think,” he said, “their tolerance is very fine.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIsmet Pasha often worked all night with his hench-men, Colonel Tewfik\r\nand Hikmet Kiamil, a grandson of Kiamil Pasha, who has inherited his\r\ngrandfather’s political talents. They felt that the slightest failure to\r\nmeet the immense demands made on the delegation would stamp them as an\r\ninferior race, and they determined it should not be.\r\n\r\nIt was actually after one of their most arduous sittings, up to three\r\no’clock in the morning, that I obtained from Ismet Pasha the\r\ncomprehensive exposition of his point of view, that I have put together\r\nin the following pages.\r\n\r\nIsmet Pasha, like Mr. Edison, is deaf; and possibly feels with that\r\ngreat inventor that, “though it is uncomfortable when people insist on\r\nmaking a spitoon of your ear, for the rest _it is all advantage_.” For\r\nexample, at dinner one can “get on with one’s thinking,” instead of\r\nlistening to the conversation. Ismet Pasha only “hears what he wants to\r\nhear,” often a great advantage in diplomacy.\r\n\r\nAs to being content with the “working of the Conference,” he said, “we\r\nare doing all in our power to make peace, but it is difficult for one\r\nnation against all the other powers. Willingly or unwillingly, they\r\ncannot see what our National Pact means to us; and that, as a proud\r\npeople, we cannot accept terms of peace which they would not think of\r\noffering the Greeks and Bulgars. It is said that the Great Powers must\r\nconciliate public opinion which hates and distrusts us as ‘barbarians,’\r\nbut we feel certain that the Powers could deal with ‘public opinion’ if\r\nthey so desired, and convince the whole world that we are now working by\r\ncivilised methods to become a free and independent nation. Instead of\r\nfacing the vital question of a ‘right to exist’ as a State, we feel that\r\nmuch time has been wasted over details that do not need any discussion.\r\nIt is known, for example, that we are offering, what we have always\r\noffered, _equal_ rights to Moslems and Christians; yet we are asked to\r\nestablish _in_equality by exempting Christians from military service.\r\n\r\n“If ever the Powers consent to accept our point of view, it is\r\nconsidered a great concession, and when we point out that our _whole_\r\ndemands have been reduced by us to the lowest minimum, they laugh;\r\nimagining it is a ‘concession’ to give us back _one room_ in our own\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n“For three years, Turkey has given proof that none can dispute of her\r\norganising capacity, her great vitality, and her deep longing to\r\nregenerate her country. We came here hoping and believing that the\r\nplenipotentiaries would bear this in mind. They do not. They beg us to\r\n‘trust’ them; but they treat us with the same caution, the same\r\n_dis_trust, as they have always shown towards the old ‘decayed’ Turkey,\r\ntowards which, maybe, there _used to be_ some slight justification. Such\r\nan attitude cannot produce satisfactory progress.”\r\n\r\n“What are the chief obstacles to Peace?”\r\n\r\n“Mosul—Finance—Judicial Capitulations—Reparations.\r\n\r\n“We are only asking four milliard gold francs for reparations. That is a\r\nsmall figure for a country that has been completely devastated, and it\r\ntakes no count of loss of life.\r\n\r\n“Mosul was never captured by Great Britain, though they claim the right\r\nof conquest. Their troops were a long way from Mosul when ours were\r\ndemobilised at the end of the war. They ‘captured’ it by ‘violating the\r\nterms of the Armistice’; as they did at Constantinople, and as the\r\nFrench did in Cilicia.\r\n\r\n“The population of Mosul is Kurd and Turkish, with only a small Arab\r\nminority. It must, therefore, belong to Turkey on all the principles by\r\nwhich the Powers have determined the frontiers of Europe. This was\r\nrecognised, indeed, in the Sykes-Picot agreement, which admitted that\r\nMosul is _not_ a part of Mesopotamia.\r\n\r\n“It was finally handed to England by the French Foreign Office; but M.\r\nClemenceau afterwards apologised that he had not previously ‘_known of\r\nthe oil there_.’ The Kurds of Mosul have nothing in common with the\r\nArabs; and naturally want to be united with their ‘brothers’ in\r\nAnatolia. Why are we the only nation to whom the principle of racial\r\nfrontiers has been denied? By what kind of justice does an Arab\r\nminority, probably smaller than one quarter of the population, give\r\nEngland the right to annex Mosul!\r\n\r\n“To insist upon our accepting ‘foreign judges,’ is an humiliating insult\r\nto our Government that is altogether incompatible with National\r\nSovereignty. Such interference, and such an affront to the authority of\r\nthe State would be no less injurious to the interests of foreigners in\r\nTurkey than to our own. It could not fail to provoke continual clashing\r\nof interests, confusion, and friction between Turkish and foreign\r\nadministration of law, that would be fatal to commercial security _for\r\nall alike_. Here again the Powers are still ‘building on sand.’\r\n\r\n“As to finance, it is a serious difficulty for us; but no question of\r\nmere money will ever separate us from England.\r\n\r\n“I firmly believe that, when once the Powers can get rid of their old\r\nprejudices, the traditional friendship will revive. England and Turkey,\r\nsurely, need each other; we need England and England needs us, if only\r\nto pacify those Moslem people whom _England’s injustice to us_ has\r\nroused to righteous anger against her.\r\n\r\n“A strong Anglo-Turkish alliance would mean not only peace in the Near\r\nEast and for Islam; it means peace for the whole world.”\r\n\r\nPeople have asked me “Why did Lausanne fail?”\r\n\r\nI answer: “It did _not_ fail. It _would_ have been failure had Ismet\r\nPasha signed, at the pistol’s point, a treaty that could not be\r\nratified. He knew that the Assembly would never sign the terms offered\r\nby the Powers; and, as I told Lord Curzon, he had to consult his\r\ncolleagues in Angora. It would hinder peace, not promote it, to sign\r\nwith no security for ratification.”\r\n\r\nAs Ismet said, “We have purchased our Anatolia with the blood and money\r\nof her peasants. We can die, but we cannot betray them.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\n TURKEY AND THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS—THE PARLIAMENT OF NATIONS MUST BE TRULY\r\n                       IMPARTIAL AND INTERNATIONAL\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR those of us who pinned their faith on the League of Nations, it is a\r\nmatter of the deepest regret that Turkey has lost her trust in the great\r\nParliament of All Nations, especially now that it could have played so\r\nimportant a part in settling our differences at the Lausanne Conference.\r\nIt is not entirely the Turks’ fault; indeed, considering all things, one\r\ncan scarcely urge them to any other attitude.\r\n\r\nTo them, at least, the League must seem definitely anti-Islam, and (as\r\nfounder of the Lyceum Club ‘League of Nations Circle,’ of which Lady\r\nGladstone is president) I have continually endeavoured to impress upon\r\nLord Robert Cecil the danger of allowing such an idea to remain\r\nuncontradicted, that it may spread more widely and be more firmly held.\r\n\r\nTurkey never interfered with British property during the war, and\r\nBritish merchants continued their business in Smyrna throughout the\r\nhostilities. Yet we not only confiscated, but sold enemy property. In\r\none case, for example, the business of a man, brought up in England and\r\na pronounced Anglophil, was sold to a Greek for a quarter of its value,\r\nand the money sequestered by the Government. Had the Bey even been a\r\ntraitor he should have been given the full value of his business, and\r\nthen expelled, instead of being driven to exist on money borrowed at an\r\nexorbitant rate of interest. On the other hand, Ottoman “Christian”\r\nproperty was freed from sequestration; a distinction between\r\n“neighbours,” hardly consistent with the teaching of our faith.\r\n\r\nThe “pick-pocketing” habit of confiscating enemy property—Turkish,\r\nGerman, or Austrian—is surely beneath an Empire with our reputation; and\r\nthe plea from France and Italy’s example does not strike one as a\r\ndignified defence. As a matter of fact, France emphatically denies ever\r\nhaving taken a penny from the Turks.\r\n\r\nIs not such flagrant injustice an obvious case for the League’s\r\nauthority to intervene? When visiting the “League of Nations”\r\nheadquarters in Geneva the other day, Sir Eric Drummond asked me why\r\nTurkey should be so suspicious of the League? I could only refer him to\r\nthe public speeches of our most responsible statesmen. When Mr. Lloyd\r\nGeorge hurled insults at Islam, it only meant one more item in the big\r\nbill of Moslem grievances against England; when Lord Balfour and Lord\r\nRobert Cecil speak in similar strains, Islam listens. While _they_\r\nrefuse justice and mercy, Turkey mistrusts the League.\r\n\r\nBecause the League stood aside, and left the Greeks in Smyrna, as\r\nBritain refused discussion with Turkish emissaries, Mustapha Kemal was\r\ndriven to arms, which gave Turkey, indeed, the victory, but spread ruin\r\nthroughout Anatolia.\r\n\r\nShould not a careful consideration for the _feelings_ of all nations be\r\nan outstanding characteristic of the League, which is the expression of\r\nthe world-brotherhood? Yet it suggested that a man, a Mr. Pitt, should\r\nbe allowed to search the harems for enslaved Greeks and Armenians! An\r\nincomprehensible insult that, if Turkey ever forgives, she cannot\r\nforget. The Turks are a proud and aristocratic race, with venerable\r\ntraditions, which, if we will not understand, we should, at least,\r\nrespect. To them, home-life is a sealed and sacred book.\r\n\r\nWhy, again, was the preparation of a full report on “harems” entrusted\r\nto a Roumanian poetess, rather than to such a woman as Halidé Hanoum, of\r\ntried experience and world-wide reputation for liberal broadmindedness?\r\nWe have depended, in the past, chiefly on nursery governesses whose\r\nexaggerations and misconceptions on this subject are invaluable to\r\nsensational writers. Hence the sordid colouring for Western eyes thrown\r\non a system of delicate lights and shades and very complicated nuances.\r\n\r\nThe Greek and Armenian servants in Turkish harems would be themselves\r\nthe first to resent interference. For they are treated in Moslem homes\r\nwith an equality, consideration, and leniency no Christian mistress\r\nwould dream of permitting. They, often, practically control the\r\nhousehold, and are, indeed, sometimes given an unwise preference in the\r\nPasha’s affections. They hold the purse-strings, direct, advise, and\r\nadminister domestic affairs, as they also, so largely, manage the\r\ncommercial life of the country. In return, naturally, the Turk expects\r\nabsolute loyalty; and woe to those who refuse, or betray, it.\r\n\r\nIt is true, of course, that backstairs propaganda—from American Relief\r\nWorkers, among others—has been at work to misinform the League; and had\r\nreliable information been available, those unfortunate mistakes would\r\nnever have been made.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the honestly impartial head of its own Press department now\r\nreports: “We have tested the real value of Greek and Armenian\r\npropaganda, and sympathise with the Turk in consequence.” Such\r\nrepentance comes rather late in the day, but may even yet produce a\r\nwiser policy.\r\n\r\nIt was one of the Fethi Bey’s many humiliating experiences, on his visit\r\nto London, to see the harem misjudged by an ex-governess, and to read\r\nthe assertion of a lady from Boston that “beautiful Greek girls had to\r\ndisfigure themselves to prevent the Turks from stealing them!”\r\nStatements that might have been treated with the contempt they deserve,\r\nhad they not been accorded such prominence by the Press.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, one must acknowledge that the Turk’s attitude towards\r\nhis detractors is more lofty than practical. Pride forbids him to answer\r\naccusations, or disseminate the truth; which he, as a fatalist, firmly\r\nbelieves “must out”! They will, certainly, never hoist the propagandist\r\n“on his own petard,” since, to their thinking, the man who accepts money\r\nto defend a cause is no better than a “political prostitute.” They argue\r\nthat “he who works for me, must believe in me, as a true friend, eager\r\nto help.” And for the moment, Europe has made them feel that “facts”\r\nwould avail them nothing—“whatever we do is wrong.”\r\n\r\nIn the East news spreads with accurate rapidity without the assistance\r\nof newspapers; but the foreigner who needs chapter and verse for every\r\nstatement may be, to some extent, excused for suspecting their obstinate\r\nreticence about statistics and exact figures. I should, myself, have\r\nwelcomed more information about a story I quite believe, but cannot\r\nsubstantiate, that came from an Italian lady at Broussa. She said that\r\nthe Greeks burnt a Turkish prison, _with all the prisoners in it_, and,\r\n“to her dying day she would never forget their awful screams,” but no\r\none will give me the least idea of how many prisoners were slaughtered.\r\nI called on a Vali whose palace was burned to cinders before I had the\r\ninformation. And I could discover no precise details, despite inquiry at\r\nAngora, Constantinople, and Lausanne!\r\n\r\nThe Norwegian head of the Minorities Committee, a man given to wise and\r\njust decisions, has said: “It is no use expecting Asiatics to be\r\nEuropeans. They have as much right to do things in their Asiatic way, as\r\nwe have to act like Europeans. There are standards of right and wrong,\r\nagainst which neither may transgress, but for the rest, nothing can be\r\ndone.” He also agreed that to secure protection from a minority, you\r\nmust enforce loyalty to the majority. I told him the head of the\r\nArmenian community had begged the Pope to see that they “were left to\r\nthe mercy” of the Turks, which _is_ merciful.\r\n\r\nThe League can really help Christians in Turkey by putting a stop to\r\npro-Christian propaganda, for which Armenians in Anatolia will have to\r\nsuffer.\r\n\r\nThere is so much that the League of one’s dream could do for Turkey, as\r\nfor all the peoples; and we criticise only from hope and desire of some\r\nhastening in its approach to perfection, and the establishing of its\r\nsupreme authority. As Sir Eric Drummond pointed out, the high-handed and\r\nretrograde attitude towards Eastern problems would not be possible were\r\nTurkey represented on the council: as others have seen, that while the\r\nso-called “enemy” peoples are unrepresented, the League cannot be truly\r\neither impartial or international.\r\n\r\nTo secure equal justice for all, it must stand outside, and above,\r\ndivisions of race, creed or prejudice.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we hope that Turkey will trust the “imperfect” League.\r\nMaybe, after all, in dealing with Mosul, it would grant the plebiscite\r\nwhich Lord Curzon declares is “impossible.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is not generally known why Colonel House chose Geneva, in preference\r\nto Lausanne, as the seat of the League of Nations.... After long and\r\ncareful deliberation, which yet produced only indecision, I am told that\r\nhe asked his valet’s advice.\r\n\r\nJoseph replied: “Geneva would be much better for your rheumatism!”\r\n\r\nOnce installed, however, Colonel House discovered another reason. At\r\nGeneva, lived Josephine!\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\n                 THE FUTURE—ABOVE ALL, A LASTING PEACE\r\n\r\n\r\nWILL the future bring us peace; above all, a lasting peace? Though\r\nnothing less is worth having, _we cannot have war_.\r\n\r\nI saw M. Franklin-Bouillon in Paris and, though not perhaps in agreement\r\nwith all he did in Syria, I maintain that his work in Moudania deserved\r\nthanks rather than criticism. He knows the Turks well, and affirms that\r\nhe would have made peace at Lausanne. He possibly might have done so,\r\nbut would it have been _lasting_ peace?\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn my way back to London we cross the channel in a Handley-Page\r\nAeroplane. There is just time to prepare a conclusive answer to all\r\nquestions about the harem; for no matter how eager we are to proceed,\r\nafter six months’ study of the Angora movement, to more important\r\nimpressions, every newspaper correspondent asks about the harem.\r\n\r\nJust as for those who, in the States; held me personally responsible for\r\nour policy in Ireland, I stole from _Life_ a witty answer, compressed\r\ninto this dramatic “tabloid,” that “turned away American wrath”:\r\n\r\n“_Pat_: Wouldn’t it be awful if England now gave us all we wanted?”\r\n\r\n“_Mike_: Sure, and ’twould be like her to play us the dirty trick.”\r\n\r\nIn like manner, I prepared two shots to kill “harem” inquiries:—\r\n\r\n_One_: “Why has the Turk only one wife, to-day?\r\n\r\n“When four wives meant four tillers of the ground, there was ‘sense’ in\r\npolygamy. It is ‘folly’ now they buy their dresses in Paris.”\r\n\r\n_Two_: “Why are you always so early at the Mosque?” a pious man was\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n“As I have two wives, I leave home as soon as possible.”\r\n\r\nThe result was as I expected.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut what about the peace for which we all wait so anxiously?\r\n\r\nWhat has the future in store for us? We must turn over a new page, and\r\nfind our way with great care, both sides first uttering their _mea\r\nculpas_, with honest courage to learn the lesson of their mistakes.\r\n\r\nAbove all, may Lausanne learn the lesson of Versailles.\r\n\r\nWhich of the Big Four dared face _the real problems_ of Versailles? They\r\ndecided nothing, but, leading us into the pestilent zone of neutrality,\r\nimposed a “Government by Committees” upon the world, which could not\r\nwork. Nature abhors neutrality, as she abhors a vacuum. And so it is in\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, however, we ask ourselves what nation was as badly\r\nbeaten as Turkey? Yet which of our late enemies has dared such open\r\ndefiance to the Allies? Not, however, in consequence of their victory\r\nover the Greeks; but because she knows that, however much we may\r\npretend, none wants to fight; and no one can win the prize of\r\n“Constantinople” save by conquest.\r\n\r\nWe had foolish visions of a new Byzantium, and thought that Greece would\r\nreward our support by a “place on the Bosphorus.” But had the Powers\r\naccepted this monstrous idea of a Greek Bosphorus, we should have found\r\nit necessary to punish the arrogance of our _soi-disant_\r\nfellow-burglars. The _timeo Danaos_, etc., of ancient Greece has still\r\nits place in modern politics.\r\n\r\nThe Allies, however, knew they could not create a “neutral”\r\nConstantinople, and had intended, before the Bolshevik regime, to\r\npresent the prize to Russia. A “committee” government of France, Italy\r\nand England would mean English rule; and our blundering had been too\r\npatent.\r\n\r\nThere remained no choice. Constantinople had to be given back to Turkey.\r\nThough she was beaten in the Great War, which she has now forgotten, we\r\ncould not conquer her (single-handed, as we should find ourselves\r\nto-day); and, therefore, “she has to have her own way.” The endeavour to\r\ncurb New Turkey by “neutral zones” would prove as useless as an attempt\r\nto check the tides. It is only by an honest peace, carefully thought out\r\nin every detail and planned for permanent security, that we can regain\r\nour prestige in the Near East.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, however, the greatest lesson we have still to learn from\r\nTurkey’s victory was spoken in Gœthe’s lines:—\r\n\r\n“He who would be just must have consideration for _all_ men.”\r\n\r\nOr again, as it is written in the Turkish lines quoted by Professor\r\nBrowne:—\r\n\r\n              Kam máta gawm un wa ma mátat makárimee pum\r\n                Wa asha gawm un was hum fi ’n—nase amwátu!\r\n\r\n        Many a people’s virtues survive when themselves are sped,\r\n        And many a people linger, who are counted by man as dead!\r\n\r\nTurkey is not dead, but born again out of the ruins of a Great\r\nCivilisation. May there be peace again between East and West, that shall\r\nbring peace to a world so greatly needing what it so little deserves!\r\n\r\nMy final words are of sincere congratulations to New Turkey, of warmest\r\nthanks to all the friends who gave unending interest to my visit, of\r\npious hopes for peace.\r\n\r\nAt Lausanne, Ismet Pasha always gave the toast of “The British Empire\r\nand King George,” and I responded with “Turkey and Mustapha Kemal\r\nPasha”; then we touched glasses, coupling the names. May “coming events\r\ncast their shadows before.” _Inch Allah!_ and again, _Inch Allah!_\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n Abdul Halik Bey, the Vali of Smyrna, 44
