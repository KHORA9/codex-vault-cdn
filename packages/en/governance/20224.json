Every day the Presidential tour was given\r\nbanner headlines; and the meeting with Khrushchev was reported as an\r\nevent of earth-shaking consequence.\r\n\r\nIt was an important event. But a meeting which was probably far more\r\nimportant, and which had commanded no front-page headlines at all, ended\r\nquietly on May 29, the day before President and Mrs. Kennedy set out on\r\ntheir grand tour.\r\n\r\nOn May 12, 1961, Dr. Philip E. Mosely, Director of Studies of the\r\nCouncil on Foreign Relations, announced that,\r\n\r\n     \"Prominent Soviet and American citizens will hold a week-long\r\n     unofficial conference on Soviet-American relations in the Soviet\r\n     Union, beginning May 22.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Mosely, a co-chairman of the American group, said that the State\r\nDepartment had approved the meeting but that the Americans involved\r\nwould go as \"private citizens\" and would express their own views.\r\n\r\n_The New York Times'_ news story on Dr. Mosely's announcement (May 13,\r\n1961) read:\r\n\r\n     \"The importance attached by the Soviet Union to the meeting appears\r\n     to be suggested by the fact that the Soviet group will include\r\n     three members of the communist party's Central Committee ... and\r\n     one candidate member of that body....\r\n\r\n     \"The meeting, to be held in the town of Nizhnyaya Oreanda, in the\r\n     Crimea, will follow the pattern of a similar unofficial meeting,\r\n     in which many of the same persons participated, at Dartmouth\r\n     College last fall. The meetings will take place in private and\r\n     there are no plans to issue an agreed statement on the subjects\r\n     discussed....\r\n\r\n     \"The topics to be discussed include disarmament and the\r\n     guaranteeing of ... international peace, the role of the United\r\n     Nations in strengthening international security, the role of\r\n     advanced nations in aiding under-developed countries, and the\r\n     prospects for peaceful and improving Soviet-United States\r\n     relations.\r\n\r\n     \"The Dartmouth conference last fall and the scheduled Crimean\r\n     conference originated from a suggestion made by Norman Cousins,\r\n     editor of _The Saturday Review_ and co-chairman of the American\r\n     group going to the Crimea, when he visited the Soviet Union a year\r\n     and a half ago....\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Cousins and Dr. Mosely formed a small American group early\r\n     last year to organize the conferences. It received financial\r\n     support from the Ford Foundation for the Dartmouth conference and\r\n     for travel costs to the Crimean meeting. This group selected the\r\n     American representatives for the two meetings.\r\n\r\n     \"Among those who participated in the Dartmouth conference were\r\n     several who have since taken high posts in the Kennedy\r\n     Administration, including Dr. Walt W. Rostow, now an assistant to\r\n     President Kennedy, and George F. Kennan; now United States\r\n     Ambassador to Yugoslavia....\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe head of the Soviet delegation to the meeting in the Soviet Union,\r\nMay 22, 1961, was Alekesander Y. Korneichuk, a close personal friend of\r\nKhrushchev. The American citizens scheduled to attend included besides\r\nDr. Mosely and Mr. Cousins:\r\n\r\n_Marian Anderson_, the singer; _Dean Erwin N. Griswold_, of the Harvard\r\nLaw School; _Gabriel Hauge_, former economic adviser to President\r\nEisenhower and now an executive of the Manufacturers Trust Company; _Dr.\r\nMargaret Mead_, a widely known anthropologist whose name (like that of\r\nNorman Cousins) has been associated with communist front activities in\r\nthe United States; _Dr. A. William Loos_, Director of the Church Peace\r\nUnion; _Stuart Chase_, American author notable for his pro-socialist,\r\nanti-anti-communist attitudes; _William Benton_, former U.S. Senator,\r\nalso well-known as a pro-socialist, anti-anti-communist, now Chairman of\r\nthe Board of _Encyclopaedia Britannica_; _Dr. George Fisher_, of the\r\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology; _Professor Paul M. Doty_, _Jr._,\r\nof Harvard's Chemistry Department; _Professor Lloyd Reynolds_, Yale\r\nUniversity economist; _Professor Louis B. Sohn_ of the Harvard Law\r\nSchool; _Dr. Joseph E. Johnson_, an old friend and former associate of\r\nAlger Hiss in the State Department, who succeeded Hiss as President of\r\nthe Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and still holds that\r\nposition; _Professor Robert R. Bowie_, former head of the State\r\nDepartment's Policy Planning Staff (a job which Hiss also held at one\r\ntime), now Director of the Center for International Affairs at Harvard;\r\nand _Dr. Arthur Larson_, former assistant to, and ghost writer for,\r\nPresident Eisenhower. Larson was often called \"Mr. Modern Republican,\"\r\nbecause the political philosophy which he espoused was precisely that of\r\nEisenhower (Larson is now, 1962, Director of the World Rule of Law\r\nCenter at Duke University, where his full-time preoccupation is working\r\nfor repeal of the Connally Reservation, so that the World Court can take\r\njurisdiction over United States affairs).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI think the meeting which the Council on Foreign Relations arranged in\r\nthe Soviet Union, in 1961, was more important than President Kennedy's\r\nmeeting with Khrushchev, because I am convinced that the Council on\r\nForeign Relations, together with a great number of other associated\r\ntax-exempt organizations, constitutes the invisible government which\r\nsets the major policies of the federal government; exercises controlling\r\ninfluence on governmental officials who implement the policies; and,\r\nthrough massive and skillful propaganda, influences Congress and the\r\npublic to support the policies.\r\n\r\nI am convinced that the objective of this invisible government is to\r\nconvert America into a socialist state and then make it a unit in a\r\none-world socialist system.\r\n\r\nMy convictions about the invisible government are based on information\r\nwhich is presented in this book.\r\n\r\nThe information about membership and activities of the Council on\r\nForeign Relations and of its interlocking affiliates comes largely from\r\npublications issued by those organizations. I am deeply indebted to\r\ncountless individuals who, when they learned of my interest, enriched my\r\nown files with material they had been collecting for years, hoping that\r\nsomeone would eventually use it.\r\n\r\nI have not managed to get all of the membership rosters and publications\r\nissued by all of the organizations discussed. Hence, there are gaps in\r\nmy information.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne aspect of the over-all subject, omitted entirely from this book, is\r\nthe working relationship between internationalist groups in the United\r\nStates and comparable groups abroad.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Institute of International Affairs in England (usually called\r\nChatham House) and the American Council on Foreign Relations were both\r\nconceived at a dinner meeting in Paris in 1919. By working with the CFR,\r\nthe Royal Institute, undoubtedly, has had profound influence on American\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nOther internationalist organizations in foreign lands which work with\r\nthe American Council on Foreign Relations, include the Institut des\r\nRelations Internationales (Belgium), Danish Foreign Policy Society,\r\nIndian Council of World Affairs, Australian Institute of International\r\nAffairs, and similar organizations in France, Italy, Yugoslavia, Greece,\r\nand Turkey.\r\n\r\nThe \"Bilderbergers\" are another powerful group involved in the\r\ninternationalist web. The \"Bilderbergers\" take their name from the scene\r\nof their first known meeting--the Bilderberg Hotel, Oosterbeck, The\r\nNetherlands, in May, 1954. The group consists of influential Western\r\nbusinessmen, diplomats, and high governmental officials. Their meetings,\r\nconducted in secrecy and in a hugger-mugger atmosphere, are held about\r\nevery six months at various places throughout the world. His Royal\r\nHighness, Prince Bernhard of The Netherlands, has presided at every\r\nknown meeting of the Bilderberger Group.\r\n\r\nPrince Bernhard is known to be an influential member of the Societé\r\nGenerale de Belgique, a mysterious organization which seems to be an\r\nassociation of large corporate interests from many countries. American\r\nfirms associated with the society are said to be among the large\r\ncorporations whose officers are members of the Council on Foreign\r\nRelations and related organizations. I make no effort to explore this\r\nsituation in this volume.\r\n\r\nMy confession of limitation upon my research does not embarrass me,\r\nbecause two committees of Congress have also failed to make a complete\r\ninvestigation of the great _camarilla_ which manipulates our government.\r\nAnd the congressional committees were trying to investigate only one\r\npart of the web--the powerful tax-exempt foundations in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nMy own research does reveal the broad outlines of the invisible\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nD.S.\r\nMay, 1962\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 1\r\n\r\nHISTORY AND THE COUNCIL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident George Washington, in his Farewell Address to the People of\r\nthe United States on September 17, 1796, established a foreign policy\r\nwhich became traditional and a main article of faith for the American\r\npeople in their dealings with the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nWashington warned against foreign influence in the shaping of national\r\naffairs. He urged America to avoid permanent, entangling alliances with\r\nother nations, recommending a national policy of benign neutrality\r\ntoward the rest of the world. Washington did not want America to build a\r\nwall around herself, or to become, in any sense, a hermit nation.\r\nWashington's policy permitted freer exchange of travel, commerce, ideas,\r\nand culture between Americans and other people than Americans have ever\r\nenjoyed since the policy was abandoned. The Father of our Country wanted\r\nthe American _government_ to be kept out of the wars and revolutions and\r\npolitical affairs of other nations.\r\n\r\nWashington told Americans that their nation had a high destiny, which it\r\ncould not fulfill if they permitted their government to become entangled\r\nin the affairs of other nations.\r\n\r\nDespite the fact of two foreign wars (Mexican War, 1846-1848; and\r\nSpanish American War, 1898) the foreign policy of Washington remained\r\nthe policy of this nation, _unaltered_, for 121 years--until Woodrow\r\nWilson's war message to Congress in April, 1917.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWilson himself, when campaigning for re-election in 1916, had\r\nunequivocally supported our traditional foreign policy: his one major\r\npromise to the American people was that he would keep them out of the\r\nEuropean war.\r\n\r\nYet, even while making this promise, Wilson was yielding to a pressure\r\nhe was never able to withstand: the influence of Colonel Edward M.\r\nHouse, Wilson's all-powerful adviser. According to House's own papers\r\nand the historical studies of Wilson's ardent admirers (see, for\r\nexample, _Intimate Papers of Colonel House_, edited by Charles Seymour,\r\npublished in 1926 by Houghton Mifflin; and, _The Crisis of the Old\r\nOrder_ by Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., published 1957 by Houghton\r\nMifflin), House created Wilson's domestic and foreign policies, selected\r\nmost of Wilson's cabinet and other major appointees, and ran Wilson's\r\nState Department.\r\n\r\nHouse had powerful connections with international bankers in New York.\r\nHe was influential, for example, with great financial institutions\r\nrepresented by such people as Paul and Felix Warburg, Otto H. Kahn,\r\nLouis Marburg, Henry Morgenthau, Jacob and Mortimer Schiff, Herbert\r\nLehman. House had equally powerful connections with bankers and\r\npoliticians of Europe.\r\n\r\nBringing all of these forces to bear, House persuaded Wilson that\r\nAmerica had an evangelistic mission to save the world for \"democracy.\"\r\nThe first major twentieth century tragedy for the United States\r\nresulted: Wilson's war message to Congress and the declaration of war\r\nagainst Germany on April 6, 1917.\r\n\r\nHouse also persuaded Wilson that the way to avoid all future wars was to\r\ncreate a world federation of nations. On May 27, 1916, in a speech to\r\nthe League to Enforce Peace, Wilson first publicly endorsed Colonel\r\nHouse's world-government idea (without, however, identifying it as\r\noriginating with House).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn September, 1916, Wilson (at the urging of House) appointed a\r\ncommittee of intellectuals (the first President's Brain Trust) to\r\nformulate peace terms and draw up a charter for world government. This\r\ncommittee, with House in charge, consisted of about 150 college\r\nprofessors, graduate students, lawyers, economists, writers, and others.\r\nAmong them were men still familiar to Americans in the 1960's: Walter\r\nLippmann (columnist); Norman Thomas (head of the American socialist\r\nparty); Allen Dulles (former head of C.I.A.); John Foster Dulles (late\r\nSecretary of State); Christian A. Herter (former Secretary of State).\r\n\r\nThese eager young intellectuals around Wilson, under the clear eyes of\r\ncrafty Colonel House, drew up their charter for world government (League\r\nof Nations Covenant) and prepared for the brave new socialist one-world\r\nto follow World War I. But things went sour at the Paris Peace\r\nConference. They soured even more when constitutionalists in the United\r\nStates Senate found out what was being planned and made it quite plain\r\nthat the Senate would not authorize United States membership in such a\r\nworld federation.\r\n\r\nBitter with disappointment but not willing to give up, Colonel House\r\ncalled together in Paris, France, a group of his most dedicated young\r\nintellectuals--among them, John Foster and Allen Dulles, Christian A.\r\nHerter, and Tasker H. Bliss--and arranged a dinner meeting with a group\r\nof like-minded Englishmen at the Majestic Hotel, Paris, on May 19, 1919.\r\nThe group formally agreed to form an organization \"for the study of\r\ninternational affairs.\"\r\n\r\nThe American group came home from Paris and formed The Council on\r\nForeign Relations, which was incorporated in 1921.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Council on Foreign Relations was to create (and\r\ncondition the American people to accept) what House called a \"positive\"\r\nforeign policy for America--to replace the traditional \"negative\"\r\nforeign policy which had kept America out of the endless turmoil of\r\nold-world politics and had permitted the American people to develop\r\ntheir great nation in freedom and independence from the rest of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe Council did not amount to a great deal until 1927, when the\r\nRockefeller family (through the various Rockefeller Foundations and\r\nFunds) began to pour money into it. Before long, the Carnegie\r\nFoundations (and later the Ford Foundation) began to finance the\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\nIn 1929, the Council (largely with Rockefeller gifts) acquired its\r\npresent headquarters property: The Harold Pratt House, 58 East 68th\r\nStreet, New York City.\r\n\r\nIn 1939, the Council began taking over the U.S. State Department.\r\n\r\nShortly after the start of World War II, in September, 1939, Hamilton\r\nFish Armstrong and Walter H. Mallory, of the Council on Foreign\r\nRelations, visited the State Department to offer the services of the\r\nCouncil. It was agreed that the Council would do research and make\r\nrecommendations for the State Department, without formal assignment or\r\nresponsibility. The Council formed groups to work in four general\r\nfields--Security and Armaments Problems, Economic and Financial\r\nProblems, Political Problems, and Territorial Problems.\r\n\r\nThe Rockefeller Foundation agreed to finance, through grants, the\r\noperation of this plan.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1941, the Council on Foreign Relations' relationship with\r\nthe State Department changed. The State Department created the Division\r\nof Special Research, which was divided into Economic, Security,\r\nPolitical, Territorial sections. Leo Pasvolsky, of the Council, was\r\nappointed Director of this Division. Within a very short time, members\r\nof the Council on Foreign Relations dominated this new Division in the\r\nState Department.\r\n\r\nDuring 1942, the State Department set up the Advisory Committee on\r\nPostwar Foreign Policy. Secretary of State Cordell Hull was Chairman.\r\nThe following members of the Council on Foreign Relations were on this\r\nCommittee: Under Secretary of State Sumner Welles (Vice-Chairman), Dr.\r\nLeo Pasvolsky (Executive Officer); Hamilton Fish Armstrong, Isaiah\r\nBowman, Benjamin V. Cohen, Norman H. Davis, and James T. Shotwell.\r\n\r\nOther members of the Council also found positions in the State\r\nDepartment: Philip E. Mosely, Walter E. Sharp, and Grayson Kirk, among\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe crowning moment of achievement for the Council came at San Francisco\r\nin 1945, when over 40 members of the United States Delegation to the\r\norganizational meeting of the United Nations (where the United Nations\r\nCharter was written) were members of the Council. Among them: Alger\r\nHiss, Secretary of State Edward R. Stettinius, Leo Pasvolsky, John\r\nFoster Dulles, John J. McCloy, Julius C. Holmes, Nelson A. Rockefeller,\r\nAdlai Stevenson, Joseph E. Johnson, Ralph J. Bunche, Clark M.\r\nEichelberger, and Thomas K. Finletter.\r\n\r\nBy 1945, the Council on Foreign Relations, and various foundations and\r\nother organizations interlocked with it, had virtually taken over the\r\nU.S. State Department.\r\n\r\nSome CFR members were later identified as Soviet espionage agents: for\r\nexample, Alger Hiss and Lauchlin Currie.\r\n\r\nOther Council on Foreign Relations members--Owen Lattimore, for\r\nexample--with powerful influence in the Roosevelt and Truman\r\nAdministrations, were subsequently identified, not as actual communists\r\nor Soviet espionage agents, but as \"conscious, articulate instruments of\r\nthe Soviet international conspiracy.\"\r\n\r\nI do not intend to imply by these citations that the Council on Foreign\r\nRelations is, or ever was, a communist organization. Boasting among its\r\nmembers Presidents of the United States (Hoover, Eisenhower, and\r\nKennedy), Secretaries of State, and many other high officials, both\r\ncivilian and military, the Council can be termed, by those who agree\r\nwith its objectives, a \"patriotic\" organization.\r\n\r\nThe fact, however, that communists, Soviet espionage agents, and\r\npro-communists could work inconspicuously for many years as influential\r\nmembers of the Council indicates something very significant about the\r\nCouncil's objectives. The ultimate aim of the Council on Foreign\r\nRelations (however well-intentioned its prominent and powerful members\r\nmay be) is the same as the ultimate aim of international communism: to\r\ncreate a one-world socialist system and make the United States an\r\nofficial part of it.\r\n\r\nSome indication of the influence of CFR members can be found in the\r\nboasts of their best friends. Consider the remarkable case of the\r\nnomination and confirmation of Julius C. Holmes as United States\r\nAmbassador to Iran. Holmes was one of the CFR members who served as\r\nUnited States delegates to the United Nations founding conference at San\r\nFrancisco in 1945.\r\n\r\nMr. Holmes has had many important jobs in the State Department since\r\n1925; but from 1945 to 1948, he was out of government service.\r\n\r\nDuring that early postwar period, the United States government had\r\napproximately 390 Merchant Marine oil tankers (built and used during\r\nWorld War II) which had become surplus.\r\n\r\nA law of Congress prohibited the government from selling the surplus\r\nvessels to foreign-owned or foreign-controlled companies, and prohibited\r\nany American company from purchasing them for resale to foreigners.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the law was to guarantee that oil tankers (vital in times\r\nof war) would remain under the control of the United States government.\r\n\r\nJulius Holmes conceived the idea of making a quick profit by buying and\r\nselling some of the surplus tankers.\r\n\r\nHolmes was closely associated with Edward Stettinius, former Secretary\r\nof State, and with two of Stettinius' principal advisers: Joe Casey, a\r\nformer U.S. Congressman; and Stanley Klein, a New York financier.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1947, this group formed a corporation (and ultimately formed\r\nothers) to buy surplus oil tankers from the government. The legal and\r\ntechnical maneuvering which followed is complex and shady, but it has\r\nall been revealed and reported by congressional committees.\r\n\r\nHolmes and his associates managed to buy eight oil tankers from the U.S.\r\ngovernment and re-sell all of them to foreign interests, in violation of\r\nthe intent of the law and of the surplus-disposal program. One of the\r\neight tankers was ultimately leased to the Soviet Union and used to haul\r\nfuel oil from communist Romania to the Chinese reds during the Korean\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nBy the time he returned to foreign service with the State Department in\r\nSeptember, 1948, Holmes had made for himself an estimated profit of\r\nabout one million dollars, with practically no investment of his own\r\nmoney, and at no financial risk.\r\n\r\nA Senate subcommittee, which, in 1952, investigated this affair,\r\nunanimously condemned the Holmes-Casey-Klein tanker deals as \"morally\r\nwrong and clearly in violation of the intent of the law,\" and as a\r\n\"highly improper, if not actually illegal, get-rich-quick\" operation\r\nwhich was detrimental to the interests of the United States.\r\n\r\nHolmes and his associates were criminally indicted in 1954--but the\r\nDepartment of Justice dismissed the indictments on a legal technicality\r\nlater that same year.\r\n\r\nA few weeks after the criminal indictment against Holmes had been\r\ndismissed, President Eisenhower, in 1955, nominated Julius C. Holmes to\r\nbe our Ambassador to Iran.\r\n\r\nEnough United States Senators in 1955 expressed a decent sense of\r\noutrage about the nomination of such a man for such a post that Holmes\r\n\"permitted\" his name to be withdrawn, before the Senate acted on the\r\nquestion of confirming his appointment.\r\n\r\nThe State Department promptly sent Holmes to Tangier with the rank of\r\nMinister; brought him back to Washington in 1956 as a Special Assistant\r\nto the Secretary of State; and sent him out as Minister and Consul\r\nGeneral in Hong Kong and Macao in 1959.\r\n\r\nAnd then, in 1961, Kennedy nominated Julius C. Holmes for the same job\r\nEisenhower had tried to give him in 1955--Ambassador to Iran.\r\n\r\nArguing in favor of Holmes, Senator Prescott Bush admitted that Holmes'\r\ntanker deals were improper and ill-advised, but claimed that Holmes was\r\nan innocent victim of sharp operators! The \"innocent\" victim made a\r\nmillion dollars in one year by being victimized. He has never offered to\r\nmake restitution to the government. Moreover, when questioned, in April,\r\n1961, Holmes said he still sees nothing wrong with what he did and\r\nadmits he would do it again if he had the opportunity--and felt that no\r\ncongressional committee would ever investigate.\r\n\r\nAll Senators, who supported Holmes in debate, hammered the point that,\r\nalthough Holmes may have done something shady and unsavory during the\r\nthree-year period in the late 1940's when he was _out_ of government\r\nservice, there was no evidence that he had ever misbehaved while he was\r\n_in_ government service.\r\n\r\nThis amoral attitude seems to imply that a known chicken thief cannot be\r\nconsidered a threat to turkey growers, unless he has actually been\r\ncaught stealing turkeys.\r\n\r\nSenate debates on the confirmation of Holmes as Ambassador to Iran are\r\nprinted in the _Congressional Record_: pp. 6385-86, April 27, 1961; pp.\r\n6668-69, May 3, 1961; and pp. 6982-95, May 8, 1961.\r\n\r\nThe vote was taken on May 8. After the history of Julius C. Holmes had\r\nbeen thoroughly exposed, the Senate confirmed Holmes' nomination 75 to\r\n21, with 4 Senators taking no stand. Julius C. Holmes was sworn in as\r\nUnited States Ambassador to Iran on May 15, 1961.\r\n\r\nThe real reason why Holmes was nominated for an important ambassadorship\r\nby two Presidents and finally confirmed by the Senate is obvious--and\r\nwas, indeed, inadvertently revealed by Senator Prescott Bush: Holmes, a\r\nCouncil on Foreign Relations member, is a darling of the leftwing\r\ninternationalists who are determined to drag America into a socialist\r\none-world system.\r\n\r\nDuring the Senate debate about Holmes' nomination Senator Bush said:\r\n\r\n     \"I believe that one of the most telling witnesses with whom I have\r\n     ever talked regarding Mr. Holmes is Mr. Henry Wriston, formerly\r\n     president of Brown University, now chairman of the Council on\r\n     Foreign Relations, in New York, and chairman of the American\r\n     Assembly. Mr. Wriston not only holds these distinguished offices,\r\n     but he has also made a special study of the State Department and\r\n     the career service in the State Department.\r\n\r\n     \"He is credited with having 'Wristonized' the Foreign Service of\r\n     the United States. He told me a few years ago ... [that] 'Julius\r\n     Holmes is the ablest man in the Foreign Service Corps of the United\r\n     States.'\"\r\n\r\nDr. Wriston was (in 1961) President (not Chairman, as Senator Bush\r\ncalled him) of the Council on Foreign Relations. But Senator Bush was\r\nnot exaggerating or erring when he said that the State Department has\r\nbeen _Wristonized_--if we acknowledge that the State Department has been\r\nconverted into an agency of Dr. Wriston's Council on Foreign Relations.\r\nIndeed, the Senator could have said that the United States government\r\nhas been _Wristonized_.\r\n\r\nHere, for example, are _some_ of the members of the Council on Foreign\r\nRelations who, in 1961, held positions in the United States Government:\r\nJohn F. Kennedy, President; Dean Rusk, Secretary of State; Douglas\r\nDillon, Secretary of the Treasury; Adlai Stevenson, United Nations\r\nAmbassador; Allen W. Dulles, Director of the Central Intelligence\r\nAgency; Chester Bowles, Under Secretary of State; W. Averell Harriman,\r\nAmbassador-at-large; John J. McCloy, Disarmament Administrator; General\r\nLyman L. Lemnitzer, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; John Kenneth\r\nGalbraith, Ambassador to India; Edward R. Murrow, Head of United States\r\nInformation Agency; G. Frederick Reinhardt, Ambassador to Italy; David\r\nK. E. Bruce, Ambassador to United Kingdom; Livingston T. Merchant,\r\nAmbassador to Canada; Lt. Gen. James M. Gavin, Ambassador to France;\r\nGeorge F. Kennan, Ambassador to Yugoslavia; Julius C. Holmes, Ambassador\r\nto Iran; Arthur H. Dean, head of the United States Delegation to Geneva\r\nDisarmament Conference; Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., Special White House\r\nAssistant; Edwin O. Reischauer, Ambassador to Japan; Thomas K.\r\nFinletter, Ambassador to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for\r\nEconomic Co-operation and Development; George C. McGhee, Assistant\r\nSecretary of State for Policy Planning; Henry R. Labouisse, Director of\r\nInternational Cooperation Administration; George W. Ball, Under\r\nSecretary of State for Economic Affairs; McGeorge Bundy, Special\r\nAssistant for National Security; Paul H. Nitze, Assistant Secretary of\r\nDefense; Adolf A. Berle, Chairman, Inter-Departmental Committee on Latin\r\nAmerica; Charles E. Bohlen, Assistant Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nThe names listed do not, by any means, constitute a complete roster of\r\nall Council members who are in the Congress or hold important positions\r\nin the Administration.\r\n\r\nIn the 1960-61 Annual Report of the Council on Foreign Relations, there\r\nis an item of information which reveals a great deal about the close\r\nrelationship between the Council and the executive branch of the federal\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nOn Page 37, The Report explains why there had been an unusually large\r\nrecent increase in the number of non-resident members (CFR members who\r\ndo not reside within 50 miles of New York City Hall):\r\n\r\n     \"The rather large increase in the non-resident academic category is\r\n     largely explained by the fact that many academic members have left\r\n     New York to join the new administration.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nConcerning President Kennedy's membership in the CFR, there is an\r\ninteresting story. On June 7, 1960, Mr. Kennedy, then a United States\r\nSenator, wrote a letter answering a question about his membership in the\r\nCouncil. Mr. Kennedy said:\r\n\r\n     \"I am a member of the Council on Foreign Relations in New York\r\n     City. As a long-time subscriber to the quarterly, Foreign Affairs,\r\n     and as a member of the Senate, I was invited to become a member.\"\r\n\r\nOn August 23, 1961, Mr. George S. Franklin, Jr., Executive Director of\r\nthe Council on Foreign Relations, wrote a letter answering a question\r\nabout President Kennedy's membership. Mr. Franklin said:\r\n\r\n     \"I am enclosing the latest Annual Report of the Council with a list\r\n     of members in the back. You will note that President Eisenhower is\r\n     a member, but this is not true of either President Kennedy or\r\n     President Truman.\"\r\n\r\nPresident Kennedy is not listed as a member in the 1960-61 Annual Report\r\nof the CFR.\r\n\r\nThe complete roster of CFR members, as set out in the 1960-61 Annual\r\nReport, is in Appendix I of this volume. Several persons, besides\r\nPresident Kennedy, whom I have called CFR members are not on this\r\nroster. I have called them CFR members, if their names have ever\r\nappeared on _any_ official CFR membership list.\r\n\r\nThe Council is actually a small organization. Its membership is\r\nrestricted to 700 resident members (American citizens whose residences\r\nor places of business are within 50 miles of City Hall in New York\r\nCity), and 700 non-resident members (American citizens who reside or do\r\nbusiness outside that 50-mile radius); but most of the members occupy\r\nimportant positions in government, in education, in the press, in the\r\nbroadcasting industry, in business, in finance, or in some\r\nmulti-million-dollar tax-exempt foundation.\r\n\r\nAn indication of overall accomplishments of the Council can be found in\r\nits Annual Report of 1958-59, which reprints a speech by Walter H.\r\nMallory on the occasion of his retiring after 32 years as Executive\r\nDirector of the Council. Speaking to the Board of Directors of the\r\nCouncil at a small dinner in his honor on May 21, 1959, Mr. Mallory\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     \"When I cast my mind back to 1927, the year that I first joined the\r\n     Council, it seems little short of a miracle that the organization\r\n     could have taken root in those days. You will remember that the\r\n     United States had decided not to join the League of Nations.... On\r\n     the domestic front, the budget was extremely small, taxes were\r\n     light ... and we didn't even recognize the Russians. What could\r\n     there possibly be for a Council on Foreign Relations to do?\r\n\r\n     \"Well, there were a few men who did not feel content with that\r\n     comfortable isolationist climate. They thought the United States\r\n     had an important role to play in the world and they resolved to try\r\n     to find out what that role ought to be. Some of those men are\r\n     present this evening.\"\r\n\r\nThe Council's principal publication is a quarterly magazine, _Foreign\r\nAffairs_. Indeed, publishing this quarterly is the Council's major\r\nactivity; and income from the publication is a principal source of\r\nrevenue for the Council.\r\n\r\nOn June 30, 1961, _Foreign Affairs_ had a circulation of only 43,500;\r\nbut it is probably the most influential publication in the world. Key\r\nfigures in government--from the Secretary of State downward--write\r\narticles for, and announce new policies in, _Foreign Affairs_.\r\n\r\nOther publications of the Council include three volumes which it\r\npublishes annually (_Political Handbook of the World_, _The United\r\nStates in World Affairs_ and _Documents on American Foreign Relations_),\r\nand numerous special studies and books.\r\n\r\nThe Council's financial statement for the 1960-61 fiscal year listed the\r\nfollowing income:\r\n\r\n    Membership Dues                                  $123,200\r\n    Council Development Fund                         $ 87,000\r\n    Committees Development Fund                      $  2,500\r\n    Corporation Service                              $112,200\r\n    Foundation Grants                                $231,700\r\n    Net Income from Investments                      $106,700\r\n    Net Receipt from Sale of Books                   $ 26,700\r\n    _Foreign Affairs_ Subscriptions and Sales   $210,300\r\n    _Foreign Affairs_ Advertising               $ 21,800\r\n    Miscellaneous                                    $  2,900\r\n                                                     ---------\r\n    Total                                            $925,000\r\n\r\n\"Corporation Service\" on this list means money contributed to the\r\nCouncil by business firms.\r\n\r\nHere are firms listed as contributors to the Council during the 1960-61\r\nfiscal year:\r\n\r\n    Aluminum Limited, Inc.\r\n    American Can Company\r\n    American Metal Climax, Inc.\r\n    American Telephone and Telegraph Company\r\n    Arabian American Oil Company\r\n    Armco International Corporation\r\n    Asiatic Petroleum Corporation\r\n    Bankers Trust Company\r\n    Belgian Securities Corporation\r\n    Bethlehem Steel Company, Inc.\r\n    Brown Brothers, Harriman and Co.\r\n    Cabot Corporation\r\n    California Texas Oil Corp.\r\n    Cameron Iron Works, Inc.\r\n    Campbell Soup Company\r\n    The Chase Manhattan Bank\r\n    Chesebrough-Pond's Inc.\r\n    Chicago Bridge and Iron Co.\r\n    Cities Service Company, Inc.\r\n    Connecticut General Life Insurance Company\r\n    Continental Can Company\r\n    Continental Oil Company\r\n    Corn Products Company\r\n    Corning Glass Works\r\n    Dresser Industries, Inc.\r\n    Ethyl Corporation\r\n    I.

Among\r\n     them are (a) free consultation with members of the Council's staff\r\n     on problems of foreign policy, (b) access to the Council's\r\n     specialized library on international affairs, including its unique\r\n     collection of magazine and press clippings, (c) copies of all\r\n     Council publications and six subscriptions to _Foreign Affairs_ for\r\n     officers of the company or its library, (d) an off-the-record\r\n     dinner, held annually for chairmen and presidents of subscribing\r\n     companies at which a prominent speaker discusses some outstanding\r\n     issue of United States foreign policy, and (e) two annual series of\r\n     Seminars for business executives appointed by their companies.\r\n     These Seminars are led by widely experienced Americans who discuss\r\n     various problems of American political or economic foreign policy.\"\r\n\r\n_All_ speakers at the Council's dinner meetings and seminars for\r\nbusiness executives are leading advocates of internationalism and the\r\ntotal state. Many of them, in fact, are important officials in\r\ngovernment. The ego-appeal is enormous to businessmen, who get special\r\noff-the-record briefings from Cabinet officers and other officials close\r\nto the President of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe briefings and the seminar lectures are consistently designed to\r\nelicit the support of businessmen for major features of Administration\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nFor example, during 1960 and 1961, the three issues of major importance\r\nto both Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy were Disarmament, the\r\ndeclining value of the American dollar, and the tariff-and-trade\r\nproblem. The Eisenhower and Kennedy positions on these three issues were\r\nvirtually identical; and the solutions they urged meshed with the\r\ninternationalist program of pushing America into a one-world socialist\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThe business executives who attended CFR briefings and seminars in the\r\n1960-61 fiscal year received expert indoctrination in the\r\ninternationalist position on the three major issues of that year. From\r\n\"Seminars For Business Executives,\" Pages 43-44 of the 1960-61 Annual\r\nReport of the Council on Foreign Relations:\r\n\r\n     \"The Fall 1960 Seminar ... was brought to a close with an appraisal\r\n     of disarmament negotiations, past and present, by Edmund A.\r\n     Gullion, then Acting Deputy Director, United States Disarmament\r\n     Administration....\r\n\r\n     \"'The International Position of the Dollar' was the theme of the\r\n     Spring 1961 Seminar series. Robert Triffin, Professor of Economics\r\n     at Yale University, spoke on the present balance of payments\r\n     situation at the opening session. At the second meeting, William\r\n     Diebold, Jr., Director of Economic Studies at the Council,\r\n     addressed the group on United States foreign trade policy. The\r\n     third meeting dealt with foreign investment and the balance of\r\n     payments. August Maffry, Vice President of the Irving Trust\r\n     Company, was discussion leader....\r\n\r\n     \"On June 8, George W. Ball, Under Secretary of State for Economic\r\n     Affairs, spoke at the annual Corporation Service dinner for\r\n     presidents and board chairmen of participating companies....\r\n     Secretary Ball [discussed] the foreign economic policy of the new\r\n     Kennedy Administration.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge W. Ball was, for several years, a registered lobbyist in\r\nWashington, representing foreign commercial interests. He is a chief\r\narchitect of President Kennedy's 1962 tariff-and-trade proposals--which\r\nwould internationalize American trade and commerce, as a prelude to\r\namalgamating our economy with that of other nations.\r\n\r\nIn 1960-61, 84 leading corporations contributed 112,200 tax-exempt\r\ndollars to the Council on Foreign Relations for the privilege of having\r\ntheir chief officers exposed to the propaganda of international\r\nsocialism.\r\n\r\nA principal activity of the Council is its meetings, according to the\r\n1958-1959 annual report:\r\n\r\n     \"During 1958-59, the Council's program of meetings continued to\r\n     place emphasis on small, roundtable meetings.... Of the 99 meetings\r\n     held during the year, 58 were roundtables.... The balance of the\r\n     meetings program was made up of the more traditional large\r\n     afternoon or dinner sessions for larger groups of Council members.\r\n     In the course of the year, the Council convened such meetings for\r\n     Premier Castro; First Deputy Premier Mikoyan; Secretary-General Dag\r\n     Hammarskjold....\"\r\n\r\nThe Council's annual report lists all of the meetings and\r\n\"distinguished\" speakers for which it convened the meetings. It is an\r\namazing list. Although the Council has tax-exemption as an organization\r\nto study international affairs and, presumably, to help the public\r\narrive at a better understanding of United States foreign policy, not\r\none speaker for any Council meeting represented traditional U. S.\r\npolicy. Every one was a known advocate of leftwing internationalism. A\r\nsurprising number of them were known communists or communist\r\nsympathizers or admitted socialists.\r\n\r\nKwame Nkrumah, Prime Minister of Ghana, who is widely believed to be a\r\ncommunist; who is admittedly socialist; and who aligned his nation with\r\nthe Soviets--spoke to the Council on \"Free Africa,\" with W. Averell\r\nHarriman presiding.\r\n\r\nMahmoud Fawzi, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the United Arab Republic,\r\na socialist whose hatred of the United States is rather well known,\r\nspoke to the Council on \"Middle East.\"\r\n\r\nHerbert L. Matthews, a member of the editorial board of _The New York\r\nTimes_ (whose articles on Castro as the Robin Hood of Cuba built that\r\ncommunist hoodlum a worldwide reputation and helped him conquer Cuba)\r\nspoke to the Council _twice_, once on \"A Political Appraisal of Latin\r\nAmerican Affairs,\" and once on \"The Castro Regime.\"\r\n\r\nM. C. Chagla, Ambassador of India to the United States, a socialist,\r\nspoke to the Council on \"Indian Foreign Policy.\"\r\n\r\nAnastas I. Mikoyan, First Deputy Premier, USSR, spoke to the Council on\r\n\"Issues in Soviet-American Relations,\" with John J. McCloy (later\r\nKennedy's Disarmament Administrator) presiding.\r\n\r\nFidel Castro spoke to the Council on \"Cuba and the United States.\"\r\n\r\nHere are some other well-known socialists who spoke to the Council on\r\nForeign Relations during the 1958-59 year:\r\n\r\nDag Hammarskjold, Secretary-General of the United Nations; Per\r\nJacobsson, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund; Abba\r\nEban, Ambassador of Israel to the United States; Willy Brandt, Mayor of\r\nWest Berlin; Stanley de Zoysa, Minister of Finance of Ceylon; Mortarji\r\nDesai, Minister of Finance of India; Victor Urquidi, President of\r\nMexican Economic Society; Fritz Erler, Co-Chairman of the Socialist\r\nGroup in the German Bundestag; Tom Mboya, Member of the Kenya\r\nLegislative Council; Sir Grantley H. Adams, Prime Minister of the West\r\nIndies Federation; Theodore Kollek, Director-General of the Office of\r\nthe Prime Minister of Israel; Dr. Gikomyo W. Kiano, member of the Kenya\r\nLegislative Council.\r\n\r\nOfficials of communist governments, in addition to those already listed,\r\nwho spoke to the Council that year, included Oscar Lange, Vice-President\r\nof the State Council of the Polish People's Republic; and Marko Nikezic,\r\nAmbassador of Yugoslavia to the United States.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThroughout this book, I show the close inter-locking connection between\r\nthe Council on Foreign Relations and many other organizations. The only\r\norganizations formally affiliated with the Council, however, are the\r\nCommittees on Foreign Relations, which the Council created, which it\r\ncontrols, and which exist in 30 cities: Albuquerque, Atlanta,\r\nBirmingham, Boise, Boston, Casper, Charlottesville, Denver, Des Moines,\r\nDetroit, Houston, Indianapolis, Little Rock, Los Angeles, Louisville,\r\nNashville, Omaha, Philadelphia, Portland (Maine), Portland (Oregon),\r\nProvidence, St. Louis, St. Paul-Minneapolis, Salt Lake City, San\r\nFrancisco, Seattle, Tucson, Tulsa, Wichita, Worcester.\r\n\r\nA booklet entitled _Committees on Foreign Relations: Directory of\r\nMembers, January, 1961_, published by the Council on Foreign Relations,\r\ncontains a roster of members of all the Committees on Foreign Relations,\r\nexcept the one at Casper, Wyoming, which was not organized until later\r\nin 1961. The booklet also gives a brief history of the Committees:\r\n\r\n     \"In 1938, with the financial assistance of the Carnegie Corporation\r\n     of New York, the Council began to organize affiliated discussion\r\n     groups in a few American cities....\r\n\r\n     \"Each Committee is composed of forty or more men who are leaders in\r\n     the professions and occupations of their area--representatives of\r\n     business, the law, universities and schools, the press, and so on.\r\n     About once a month, from October through May, members come together\r\n     for dinner and an evening of discussion with a guest speaker of\r\n     special competence.... Since the beginning in 1938, the Carnegie\r\n     Corporation of New York has continued to make annual grants in\r\n     support of the Committee program.\"\r\n\r\nThe following information about the Committees on Foreign Relations is\r\nfrom the 1960-61 Annual Report of the Council on Foreign Relations:\r\n\r\n     \"During the past season the Foreign Relations Committees carried on\r\n     their customary programs of private dinner meetings. In all, 206\r\n     meetings were held....\r\n\r\n     \"The Council arranged or figured in the arrangement of about\r\n     three-quarters of the meetings held, the other sessions being\r\n     undertaken upon the initiative of the Committees. Attendance at the\r\n     discussions averaged 28 persons, slightly more than in previous\r\n     years and about the maximum number for good discussion. There was\r\n     little change in membership--the total being just under 1800. It\r\n     will be recalled that this membership consists of men who are\r\n     leaders in the various professions and occupations....\r\n\r\n     \"On June 2 and 3, the 23rd annual conference of Committee\r\n     representatives was held at the Harold Pratt House. Mounting\r\n     pressures throughout the year ... made it advisable to plan a\r\n     conference program that would facilitate re-examination of the\r\n     strategic uses of the United Nations for American Policy in the\r\n     years ahead. Accordingly, the conference theme was designated as\r\n     _United States Policy and the United Nations_. Emphasis was upon\r\n     re-appraisal of the United States national interest in the United\r\n     Nations--and the cost of sustaining that interest....\r\n\r\n     \"In the course of the year, officers and members of the Council and\r\n     of the staff visited most of the Committees for the purpose of\r\n     leading discussions at meetings, supervising Committee procedures\r\n     and seeking the strengthening of Committee relations with the\r\n     Council.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 2\r\n\r\nWORLD WAR II AND TRAGIC CONSEQUENCES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the Council on Foreign Relations had almost gained controlling\r\ninfluence on the government of the United States as early as 1941, it\r\nhad failed to indoctrinate the American people for acceptance of what\r\nColonel House had called a \"positive\" foreign policy.\r\n\r\nIn 1940, Franklin D. Roosevelt (although eager to get the United States\r\ninto the Second World War and already making preparations for that\r\ntragedy) had to campaign for re-election with the same promise that\r\nWilson had made in 1916--to keep us out of the European war. Even as\r\nlate as the day before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December,\r\n1941, the American people were still overwhelmingly \"isolationist\"--a\r\nword which internationalists use as a term of contempt but which means\r\nmerely that the American people were still devoted to their nation's\r\ntraditional foreign policy.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary for Roosevelt to take steps which the public would not\r\nnotice or understand but which would inescapably involve the nation in\r\nthe foreign war. When enough such sly involvement had been manipulated,\r\nthere would come, eventually, some incident to push us over the brink\r\ninto open participation. Then, any American who continued to advocate\r\nour traditional foreign policy of benign neutrality would be an object\r\nof public hatred, would be investigated and condemned by officialdom as\r\na \"pro-nazi,\" and possibly prosecuted for sedition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Council on Foreign Relations has heavy responsibility for the\r\nmaneuvering which thus dragged America into World War II. One major step\r\nwhich Roosevelt took toward war (at precisely the time when he was\r\ncampaigning for his third-term re-election on a platform of peace and\r\nneutrality to keep America out of war) was his radical alteration of\r\ntraditional concepts of United States policy in order to declare\r\nGreenland under the protection of our Monroe Doctrine. The Council on\r\nForeign Relations officially boasts full responsibility for this fateful\r\nstep toward war.\r\n\r\nOn pages 13 and 14 of a book entitled _The Council on Foreign Relations:\r\nA Record of Twenty-Five Years, 1921-1946_ (written by officials of the\r\nCouncil and published by the Council on January 1, 1947) are these\r\npassages:\r\n\r\n     \"One further example may be cited of the way in which ideas and\r\n     recommendations originating at Council meetings have entered into\r\n     the stream of official discussion and action.\r\n\r\n     \"On March 17, 1940, a Council group completed a confidential report\r\n     which pointed out the strategic importance of Greenland for\r\n     transatlantic aviation and for meteorological observations. The\r\n     report stated:\r\n\r\n     \"'The possibility must be considered that Denmark might be overrun\r\n     by Germany. In such case, Greenland might be transferred by treaty\r\n     to German sovereignty.'\r\n\r\n     \"It also pointed out the possible danger to the United States in\r\n     such an eventuality, and mentioned that Greenland lies within the\r\n     geographical sphere 'within which the Monroe Doctrine is presumed\r\n     to apply.'\r\n\r\n     \"Shortly after this, one of the members of the group which had\r\n     prepared the report was summoned to the White House. President\r\n     Roosevelt had a copy of the memorandum in his hand and said that he\r\n     had turned to his visitor for advice because of his part in\r\n     raising the question of Greenland's strategic importance.\r\n\r\n     \"Germany invaded Denmark on April 9, 1940. At his press conference\r\n     three days later, the President stated that he was satisfied that\r\n     Greenland was a part of the American continent. After a visit to\r\n     the White House on the same day, the Danish Minister said that he\r\n     agreed with the President.\r\n\r\n     \"On April 9, 1941, an agreement was signed between the United\r\n     States and Denmark which provided for assistance by the United\r\n     States to Greenland in the maintenance of its status, and granted\r\n     to the United States the right to locate and construct such\r\n     airplane landing-fields, seaplane facilities, and radio and\r\n     meteorological installations as might be necessary for the defense\r\n     of Greenland, and for the defense of the American continent. This\r\n     was eight months before Germany declared war on the United States.\r\n\r\n     \"The Council's report on Greenland was only one item in an\r\n     extensive research project which offered an unusual instance of\r\n     wartime collaboration between Government agencies and a private\r\n     institution.... The project ... exhibited the kind of contribution\r\n     which the Council has been uniquely equipped to provide....\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Danish colony of Greenland--a huge island covered by polar ice--lies\r\nin the Arctic Ocean, 1325 miles off the coast of Denmark. It is 200\r\nmiles from Canada, 650 miles from the British Isles. The extreme\r\nsouthwestern tip of Greenland is 1315 miles from the most extreme\r\nnortheastern tip of the United States (Maine). In other words, Canada\r\nand England, which were at war with Germany when we undertook to protect\r\nGreenland from Germany, are both much closer to Greenland than the\r\nUnited States is.\r\n\r\nBut history gives better proof than geography does, that the learned\r\nCouncil members who put Greenland in the Western Hemisphere, within the\r\nmeaning of the Monroe Doctrine, were either ignorant or dishonest. The\r\nMonroe Doctrine, closing the Western Hemisphere to further European\r\ncolonization, was proclaimed in 1823. Denmark, a European nation,\r\ncolonized Greenland, proclaiming sole sovereignty in 1921, without any\r\nhint of protest from the United States that this European colonization\r\ninfringed upon the Monroe Doctrine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMembers of the Council on Foreign Relations played a key role in getting\r\nAmerica into World War II. They played _the_ role in creating the basic\r\npolicies which this nation has followed since the end of World War II.\r\nThese policies are accomplishing:\r\n\r\n     (1) the redistribution to other nations of the great United States\r\n     reserve of gold which made our dollar the strongest currency in the\r\n     world;\r\n\r\n     (2) the building up of the industrial capacity of other nations, at\r\n     our expense, thus eliminating our pre-eminent productive\r\n     superiority;\r\n\r\n     (3) the taking away of world markets from United States producers\r\n     (and even much of their domestic market) until capitalistic America\r\n     will no longer dominate world trade;\r\n\r\n     (4) the entwining of American affairs--economic, political,\r\n     cultural, social, educational, and even religious--with those of\r\n     other nations until the United States will no longer have an\r\n     independent policy, either domestic or foreign: until we can not\r\n     return to our traditional foreign policy of maintaining national\r\n     independence, nor to free private capitalism as an economic system.\r\n\r\nThe ghastly wartime and post-war decisions (which put the Soviet Union\r\nastride the globe like a menacing colossus and placed the incomparably\r\nstronger United States in the position of appeasing and retreating) can\r\nbe traced to persons who were members of the Council on Foreign\r\nRelations.\r\n\r\nConsider a specific example: the explosive German problem.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn October, 1943, Cordell Hull (U. S. Secretary of State), Anthony Eden\r\n(Foreign Minister for Great Britain), and V. Molotov (Soviet Commissar\r\nfor Foreign Affairs), had a conference at Moscow. Eden suggested that\r\nthey create a European Advisory Commission which would decide how\r\nGermany, after defeat, would be partitioned, occupied, and governed by\r\nthe three victorious powers. Molotov approved. Hull did not like the\r\nidea, but agreed to it in deference to the wishes of the two others.\r\nPhilip E. Mosely, of the CFR, was Hull's special adviser at this Moscow\r\nConference.\r\n\r\nThe next month, November, 1943, President Franklin D. Roosevelt went to\r\nTehran for his first conference with Stalin and Churchill. Aboard the U.\r\nS. S. _Iowa_ en route to Tehran, Roosevelt had a conference with his\r\nJoint Chiefs of Staff. They discussed, among other things, the post-war\r\ndivision and occupation of Germany.\r\n\r\nPresident Roosevelt predicted that Germany would collapse suddenly and\r\nthat \"there would definitely be a race for Berlin\" by the three great\r\npowers. The President said: \"We may have to put the United States\r\ndivisions into Berlin as soon as possible, because the United States\r\nshould have Berlin.\"\r\n\r\nHarry Hopkins suggested that \"we be ready to put an airborne division\r\ninto Berlin two hours after the collapse of Germany.\"\r\n\r\nRoosevelt wanted the United States to occupy Berlin and northwestern\r\nGermany; the British to occupy France, Belgium, and southern Germany;\r\nand the Soviets to have eastern Germany.\r\n\r\nAt the Tehran Conference (November 27-December 2, 1943), Stalin seemed\r\nsingularly indifferent to the question of which power would occupy which\r\nzones of Germany after the war. Stalin revealed intense interest in only\r\nthree topics:\r\n\r\n(1) urging the western allies to make a frontal assault, across the\r\nEnglish Channel, on Hitler's fortress Europe;\r\n\r\n(2) finding out, immediately, the name of the man whom the western\r\nallies would designate to command such an operation (Eisenhower had not\r\nyet been selected); and\r\n\r\n(3) reducing the whole of Europe to virtual impotence so that the Soviet\r\nUnion would be the only major power on the continent after the war.\r\n\r\nRoosevelt approved of every proposal Stalin made.\r\n\r\nA broad outline of the behavior and proposals of Roosevelt, Churchill,\r\nand Stalin at Tehran can be found in the diplomatic papers published in\r\n1961 by the State Department, in a volume entitled _Foreign Relations of\r\nthe United States: Diplomatic Papers: The Conferences at Cairo and\r\nTehran 1943_.\r\n\r\nAs to specific agreements on the postwar division and occupation of\r\nGermany, the Tehran papers reveal only that the European Advisory\r\nCommission would work out the details.\r\n\r\nWe know that Roosevelt and his military advisers in November, 1943,\r\nagreed that America should take and occupy Berlin. Yet, 17 months later,\r\nwe did just the opposite.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the closing days of World War II, the American Ninth Army was rolling\r\ntoward Berlin, meeting little resistance, slowed down only by German\r\ncivilians clogging the highways, fleeing from the Russians. German\r\nsoundtrucks were circulating in the Berlin area, counseling stray\r\ntroops to stop resistance and surrender to the Americans. Some twenty or\r\nthirty miles east of Berlin, the German nation had concentrated its\r\ndying strength and was fighting savagely against the Russians.\r\n\r\nOur Ninth Army could have been in Berlin within a few hours, probably\r\nwithout shedding another drop of blood; but General Eisenhower suddenly\r\nhalted our Army. He kept it sitting idly outside Berlin for days, while\r\nthe Russians slugged their way in, killing, raping, ravaging. We gave\r\nthe Russians control of the eastern portion of Berlin--and of _all_ the\r\nterritory surrounding the city.\r\n\r\nTo the south, General Patton's forces were plowing into Czechoslovakia.\r\nWhen Patton was thirty miles from Prague, the capital, General\r\nEisenhower ordered him to stop--ordered him not to accept surrender of\r\nGerman soldiers, but to hold them at bay until the Russians could move\r\nup and accept surrender. As soon as the Russians were thus established\r\nas the conquerors of Czechoslovakia, Eisenhower ordered Patton to\r\nevacuate.\r\n\r\nUnits of Czechoslovakian patriots had been fighting with Western armies\r\nsince 1943. We had promised them that they could participate in the\r\nliberation of their own homeland; but we did not let them move into\r\nCzechoslovakia until after the Russians had taken over.\r\n\r\nCzechoslovakian and American troops had to ask the Soviets for\r\npermission to come into Prague for a victory celebration--after the\r\nRussians had been permitted to conquer the country.\r\n\r\nWestern Armies, under Eisenhower's command, rounded up an estimated five\r\nmillion anti-communist refugees and delivered them to the Soviets who\r\ntortured them, sent them to slave camps, or murdered them.\r\n\r\nAll of this occurred because we refused to do what would have been easy\r\nfor us to do--and what our top leaders had agreed just 17 months before\r\nthat we must do: that is, take and hold Berlin and surrounding territory\r\nuntil postwar peace treaties were made.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWho made the decisions to pull our armies back in Europe and let the\r\nSoviets take over? General Eisenhower gave the orders; and, in his book,\r\n_Crusade in Europe_ (published in 1948, before the awful consequences of\r\nthose decisions were fully known to the public), Eisenhower took his\r\nshare of credit for making the decisions. When he entered politics four\r\nyears later, Eisenhower denied responsibility: he claimed that he was\r\nmerely a soldier, obeying orders, implementing decisions which\r\nPresidents Roosevelt and Truman had made.\r\n\r\nMemoirs of British military men indicate that Eisenhower went far\r\n_beyond_ the call of military duty in his \"co-operative\" efforts to help\r\nthe Soviets capture political prisoner's and enslave all of central\r\nEurope. _Triumph in the West_, by Arthur Bryant, published in 1959 by\r\nDoubleday & Company, as a \"History of the War Years Based on the Diaries\r\nof Field-Marshal Lord Alanbrooke, Chief of the Imperial General Staff,\"\r\nreveals that, in the closing days of the war, General Eisenhower was\r\noften in direct communication with Stalin, reporting his decisions and\r\nactions to the Soviet dictator before Eisenhower's own military\r\nsuperiors knew what was going on.\r\n\r\nRegardless of what responsibility General Eisenhower may or may not have\r\nhad for _formulating_ the decisions which held our armies back from\r\nEastern Europe, those decisions seem to have stemmed from the\r\nconferences which Roosevelt had with Stalin at Tehran in 1943 and at\r\nYalta in 1945.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut who made the decision to isolate Berlin 110 miles deep inside\r\ncommunist-controlled territory without any agreements concerning access\r\nroutes by which the Western Powers could get to the city? According to\r\nArthur Krock, of the _New York Times_, George F. Kennan, (a member of\r\nthe Council on Foreign Relations) persuaded Roosevelt to accept the\r\nBerlin zoning arrangement. Kennan, at the time, was political adviser to\r\nAmbassador John G. Winant, who was the United States Representative on\r\nthe three-member European Advisory Commission.\r\n\r\nMr. Krock's account (in the _New York Times_, June 18, 1961 and July 2,\r\n1961) is rather involved; but here is the essence of it:\r\n\r\n     President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill agreed to enclose\r\n     Berlin 110 miles within the Soviet occupation zone. Winant\r\n     submitted a recommendation, embracing this agreement. Winant felt\r\n     that it would offend the Soviets if we asked for guaranteed access\r\n     routes, and believed that guarantees were unnecessary anyway. When\r\n     submitting his recommendation to Washington, however, Winant\r\n     attached a map on which a specific allied corridor of access into\r\n     the city was drawn.\r\n\r\n     Winant's proposal was never acted on in Washington. Therefore, the\r\n     British submitted a recommendation. Roosevelt rejected the British\r\n     plan, and made his own proposal. The British and Soviets disliked\r\n     Roosevelt's plan; and negotiations over the zoning of Berlin were\r\n     deadlocked.\r\n\r\n     George F. Kennan broke the deadlock by going directly to Roosevelt\r\n     and persuading him to accept the Berlin zoning agreement, which Mr.\r\n     Krock calls a \"war-breeding monstrosity,\" and a \"witless travesty\r\n     on statecraft and military competence.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Krock says most of his information came from one of Philip E.\r\nMosely's articles in an old issue of _Foreign Affairs_--which I have\r\nbeen unable to get for my files. I cannot, therefore, guarantee the\r\nauthenticity of Mr. Krock's account; but I can certainly agree with his\r\nconclusion that only Joseph Stalin and international communism\r\nbenefitted from the \"incredible zoning agreements\" that placed \"Berlin\r\n110 miles within the Soviet zone and reserved no guaranteed access\r\nroutes to the city from the British and American zones.\"\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that Philip E. Mosely (CFR member who was\r\nCordell Hull's adviser when the postwar division of Germany was first\r\ndiscussed at the Moscow Conference in 1943) succeeded George F. Kennan\r\nas political adviser to John G. Winant of the European Advisory\r\nCommission shortly after Kennan had persuaded Roosevelt to accept the\r\nBerlin zoning agreements.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see why the Soviets wanted the Berlin arrangement which\r\nRoosevelt gave them. It is not difficult to see the British viewpoint:\r\nsqueezed between the two giants who were his allies, Churchill tried to\r\nplay the Soviets against the Americans, in the interest of getting the\r\nmost he could for the future trade and commerce of England.\r\n\r\nBut why would any American want (or, under any conditions, agree to) the\r\ncrazy Berlin agreement? There are only three possible answers:\r\n\r\n(1) the Americans who set up the Berlin arrangement--which means,\r\nspecifically, George F. Kennan and Philip E. Mosely, representing the\r\nCouncil on Foreign Relations--were ignorant fools; or\r\n\r\n(2) they _wanted_ to make Berlin a powder keg which the Soviets could\r\nuse, at will, to intimidate the West; or\r\n\r\n(3) they wanted a permanent, ready source of war which the United States\r\ngovernment could use, at any time, to salvage its own internationalist\r\npolicies from criticism at home, by scaring the American people into\r\n\"buckling down\" and \"tightening up\" for \"unity\" behind our \"courageous\r\nPresident\" who is \"calling the Kremlin bluff\" by spending to prepare\r\nthis nation for all-out war, if necessary, to \"defend the interests of\r\nthe free-world\" in Berlin.\r\n\r\nGeorge F. Kennan and Philip E. Mosely and the other men associated with\r\nthem in the Council on Foreign Relations are not ignorant fools. I do\r\nnot believe they are traitors who wanted to serve the interests of the\r\nKremlin. So, in trying to assess their motives, I am left with one\r\nchoice: they wanted to set Berlin up as a perpetual excuse for any kind\r\nof program which the Council on Foreign Relations might want the\r\nAmerican government to adopt.\r\n\r\nLong, long ago, King Henry of England told Prince Hal that the way to\r\nrun a country and keep the people from being too critical of how you run\r\nit, is to busy giddy minds with foreign quarrels.\r\n\r\nA study of President Kennedy's July 25, 1961, speech to the nation about\r\nBerlin, together with an examination of the spending program which he\r\nrecommended to Congress a few hours later, plus a review of contemporary\r\naccounts of how the stampeded Congress rushed to give the President all\r\nhe asked--such a study, set against the backdrop of our refusal to do\r\nanything vigorous with regard to the communist menace in Cuba, will, I\r\nthink, justify my conclusions as to the motives of men, still in power,\r\nwho created the Berlin situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 3\r\n\r\nFPA--WORLD AFFAIRS COUNCIL--IPR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough many interlocking organizations, the Council on Foreign\r\nRelations \"educates\" the public--and brings pressures upon Congress--to\r\nsupport CFR policies. All organizations, in this incredible propaganda\r\nweb, work in their own way toward the objective of the Council on\r\nForeign Relations: to create a one-world socialist system and to make\r\nAmerica a part of it. All of the organizations have federal\r\ntax-exemption as \"educational\" groups; and they are all financed, in\r\npart, by tax-exempt foundations, the principal ones being Ford,\r\nRockefeller, and Carnegie. Most of them also have close working\r\nrelations with official agencies of the United States Government.\r\n\r\nThe CFR does not have formal affiliation--and can therefore disclaim\r\nofficial connection with--its subsidiary propaganda agencies (except the\r\nCommittees on Foreign Relations, organized by the CFR in 30 cities\r\nthroughout the United States); but the real and effective interlock\r\nbetween all these groups can be shown not only by their common objective\r\n(one-world socialism) and a common source of income (the foundations),\r\nbut also by the overlapping of personnel: directors and officials of the\r\nCouncil on Foreign Relations are also officials in the interlocking\r\norganizations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Foreign Policy Association-World Affairs Center, 345 East 46th\r\nStreet, New York 17, New York, is probably the most influential of all\r\nthe agencies which can be shown as propaganda affiliates of the Council\r\non Foreign Relations in matters concerned primarily with American\r\nforeign policy.\r\n\r\nOn April 29, 1960, the March-April Term Grand Jury of Fulton County,\r\nGeorgia, handed down a Presentment concerning subversive materials in\r\nschools, which said:\r\n\r\n     \"An extensive investigation has been made by the Jury into the\r\n     Foreign Policy Association of New York City and its 'Great\r\n     Decisions Program,' which it is sponsoring in our area....\r\n\r\n     \"This matter was brought to our attention by the Americanism\r\n     Committee of the Waldo M. Slaton Post 140, American Legion, and\r\n     several other local patriotic groups. We were informed that the\r\n     Great Decisions Program was being taught in our public high schools\r\n     and by various well-meaning civic and religious groups, who were\r\n     not aware of the past records of the leaders of the Foreign Policy\r\n     Association, nor of the authors of the textbooks prescribed for\r\n     this Great Decisions program.\r\n\r\n     \"Evidence was presented to us showing that some of these leaders\r\n     and authors had a long record, dating back many years, in which\r\n     they either belonged to, or actively supported left-wing or\r\n     subversive organizations.\r\n\r\n     \"We further found that invitations to participate in these 'study\r\n     groups' were being mailed throughout our county under the name of\r\n     one of our local universities.... We learned that the prescribed\r\n     booklets were available upon request in our local public\r\n     libraries....\r\n\r\n     \"The range of the activity by this organization has reached\r\n     alarming proportions in the schools and civic groups in certain\r\n     other areas in Georgia. Its spread is a matter of deep concern to\r\n     this Jury and we, therefore, call upon all school officials\r\n     throughout the state to be particularly alert to this insidious and\r\n     subversive material. We further recommend that all textbook\r\n     committee members--city, county and state--recognize the\r\n     undesirable features of this material and take action to remove it\r\n     from our schools.\r\n\r\n     \"Finally, we urge that all Grand Juries throughout the State of\r\n     Georgia give matters of this nature their serious consideration.\"\r\n\r\nOn June 30, 1960, the May-June Term Grand Jury of Fulton County,\r\nGeorgia, handed down another Presentment, which said:\r\n\r\n     \"It is our understanding that the Foreign Policy Association's\r\n     Great Decisions program, criticized by the March-April Grand Jury,\r\n     Fulton County, has been removed from the Atlanta and Fulton County\r\n     schools....\r\n\r\n     \"Numerous letters from all over the United States have been\r\n     received by this grand jury, from individuals and associations,\r\n     commending the Presentment of the previous grand jury on the\r\n     Foreign Policy Association. Not a single letter has been received\r\n     by us criticizing these presentments.\"\r\n\r\nIn September, 1960, the Americanism Committee of Waldo M. Slaton Post\r\nNo. 140, The American Legion, 3905 Powers Ferry Road, N.W., Atlanta 5,\r\nGeorgia, published a 112-page mimeographed book entitled _The Truth\r\nAbout the Foreign Policy Association_ (available directly from the Post\r\nat $1.00 per copy). In the Foreword to this book, the Americanism\r\nCommittee says:\r\n\r\n     \"How can we account for our apathetic acceptance of the presence of\r\n     this arch-murderer (Khrushchev, during his tour of the United\r\n     States at Eisenhower's invitation) in America? What has so dulled\r\n     our sense of moral values that we could look on without revulsion\r\n     while he was being wined and dined by our officials? How could we\r\n     dismiss with indifference the shameful spectacle of these officials\r\n     posing for pictures with this grinning Russian assassin--pictures\r\n     which we knew he would use to prove to communism's enslaved\r\n     populations that the Americans are no longer their friends, but the\r\n     friends of Khrushchev?\r\n\r\n     \"There is only one explanation for this lapse from the Americanism\r\n     of former days: we are being brainwashed into the belief that we\r\n     can safely do business with communism--brainwashed by an\r\n     interlocked group of so-called 'educational' organizations offering\r\n     'do-it-yourself' courses which pretend to instruct the public in\r\n     the intricacies of foreign policy, but which actually mask clever\r\n     propaganda operations designed to sell 'co-existence' to Americans.\r\n     There are many of these propaganda outfits working to undermine\r\n     Americans' faith in America, but none, in our opinion, is as slick\r\n     or as smooth or as dangerous as the Foreign Policy Association of\r\n     Russian-born Vera Micheles Dean....\r\n\r\n     \"This documented handbook has been prepared in response to numerous\r\n     requests for duplicates of the file which formed the basis of the\r\n     case (before the Fulton County Grand Juries) against the Foreign\r\n     Policy Association. We hope that it will assist patriots everywhere\r\n     in resisting the un-American propaganda of the Red China appeasers,\r\n     the pro-Soviet apologists, the relativists, and other dangerous\r\n     propagandists who are weakening Americans' sense of honor and their\r\n     will to survive.\"\r\n\r\n_The Truth About The Foreign Policy Association_ sets out the communist\r\nfront record of Vera Micheles Dean (who was Research Director of the FPA\r\nuntil shortly after the Legion Post made this exposure, when she\r\nresigned amidst almost-tearful words of praise and farewell on the part\r\nof FPA-WAC officials). The Legion Post booklet sets out the communist\r\nfront records of various other persons connected with the FPA; it\r\npresents and analyzes several publications of the FPA, including\r\nmaterials used in the Great Decisions program; it reveals that FPA\r\nestablishes respectability and public acceptance for itself by\r\npublicizing \"endorsements\" of prominent Americans; it shows that many of\r\nthe FPA's claims of endorsements are false; it shows the interlocking\r\nconnections and close working relationships between the Foreign Policy\r\nAssociation and other organizations, particularly the National Council\r\nof Churches; and it presents a great deal of general documentation on\r\nFPA's activities, operations, and connections.\r\n\r\nThe Foreign Policy Association was organized in 1918 and incorporated\r\nunder the laws of New York in 1928 (the Council on Foreign Relations was\r\norganized in 1919 and incorporated in 1921). Rockefeller and Carnegie\r\nmoney was responsible for both FPA and CFR becoming powerful\r\norganizations.\r\n\r\nThe late U. S. Congressman Louis T. McFadden (Pennsylvania), as early as\r\n1934, said that the Foreign Policy Association, working in close\r\nconjunction with a comparable British group, was formed, largely under\r\nthe aegis of Felix Frankfurter and Paul Warburg, to promote a \"planned\"\r\nor socialist economy in the United States, and to integrate the American\r\nsystem into a worldwide socialist system. Warburg and Frankfurter (early\r\nCFR members) were among the many influential persons who worked closely\r\nwith Colonel Edward M. House, father of the Council on Foreign\r\nRelations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom its early days, the Foreign Policy Association had interlocking\r\npersonnel, and worked in close co-operation with the Institute of\r\nPacific Relations, which was formed in 1925 as a tax-exempt educational\r\norganization, and which was financed by the great foundations--and by\r\nthe same groups of businessmen and corporations which have always\r\nfinanced the CFR and the FPA.\r\n\r\nThe IPR played a more important role than any other American\r\norganization in shaping public opinion and influencing official\r\nAmerican policy with regard to Asia.\r\n\r\nFor more than twenty years, the IPR influenced directly or indirectly\r\nthe selection of Far Eastern scholars for important teaching posts in\r\ncolleges and universities--and the selection of officials for posts\r\nconcerning Asia in the State Department. The IPR publications were\r\nstandard materials in most American colleges, in thirteen hundred public\r\nschool systems, and in the armed forces; and millions of IPR\r\npublications were distributed to all these institutions.\r\n\r\nAlong toward the end of World War II, there were rumblings that the\r\npowerful IPR might be a communist front, despite its respectable\r\nfaçade--despite the fact that a great majority of its members were\r\nAmericans whose patriotism and integrity were beyond question.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1951, the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, under the\r\nchairmanship of the late Pat McCarran (Democrat, Nevada) began an\r\ninvestigation which lasted many months and became the most important,\r\ncareful, and productive investigation ever conducted by a committee of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe McCarran investigation of the IPR was predicated on the assumption\r\nthat United States diplomacy had never suffered a more disastrous defeat\r\nthan in its failure to avert the communist conquest of China.\r\n\r\nThe communist conquest of China led to the Korean war; and the tragic\r\nmishandling of this war on the part of Washington and United Nations\r\nofficialdom destroyed American prestige throughout Asia, and built\r\nChinese communist military power into a menacing colossus.\r\n\r\nThe Senate investigation revealed that the American policy decisions\r\nwhich produced these disastrous consequences were made by IPR officials\r\nwho were traitors, or under the influence of traitors, whose allegiance\r\nlay in Moscow.\r\n\r\nOwen Lattimore, guiding light of the IPR during its most important years\r\n(and also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations), was termed a\r\nconscious articulate instrument of the Soviet international conspiracy.\r\n\r\nAlger Hiss (a CFR member who was later identified as a Soviet spy) was\r\nclosely tied in with the IPR during his long and influential career in\r\ngovernment service. Hiss became a trustee of the IPR after his\r\nresignation from the State Department. The secret information which Hiss\r\ndelivered to a Soviet spy ring in the 1930's kept the Soviets apprised\r\nof American activity in the Far East.\r\n\r\nLauchlin Currie (also a member of the CFR) was an administrative\r\nassistant to President Roosevelt. Harry Dexter White virtually ran the\r\nTreasury Department under both Roosevelt and Truman. Both Currie and\r\nWhite had strong connections with the IPR; and both were Soviet\r\nspies--who not only channeled important American secrets to Soviet\r\nmilitary intelligence, but also influenced and formulated American\r\npolicies to suit the Soviets.\r\n\r\nBy the time the McCarran investigation ended, the whole nation knew that\r\nthe IPR was, as the McCarran committee had characterized it, a\r\ntransmission belt for Soviet propaganda in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe IPR, thoroughly discredited, had lost its power and influence; but\r\nits work was carried on, without any perceptible decline in\r\neffectiveness, by the Foreign Policy Association.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe FPA did this job through its Councils on World Affairs, which had\r\nbeen set up in key cities throughout the United States.\r\n\r\nThese councils are all \"anti-communist.\" They include among their\r\nmembers the business, financial, social, cultural, and educational\r\nleaders of the community. Their announced purpose is to help citizens\r\nbecome better informed on international affairs and foreign policy. To\r\nthis end, they arrange public discussion groups, forums, seminars in\r\nconnection with local schools and colleges, radio-television programs,\r\nand lecture series. They distribute a mammoth quantity of expensively\r\nproduced material--to schools, civic clubs, discussion groups, and so\r\non, at little or no cost.\r\n\r\nThe Councils bring world-renowned speakers to their community. Hence,\r\nCouncil events generally make headlines and get wide coverage on radio\r\nand television. The Foreign Policy Associations' Councils on World\r\nAffairs, through the parent organization, through the Council on Foreign\r\nRelations, and through a multitude of other channels, have close working\r\nrelationships with the State Department.\r\n\r\nHence, many of the distinguished speakers whom the Councils present are\r\nhandpicked by the State Department; and they travel (sometimes from\r\ndistant foreign lands) at United States taxpayers' expense.\r\n\r\nTo avert criticism (or to provide themselves with ammunition against\r\ncriticism when it arises) that they are nothing but internationalist\r\npropaganda agencies, the Councils on World Affairs distribute a little\r\nliterature which, and present a few speakers who, give the general\r\nappearance of being against the internationalist program of one-world\r\nsocialism. But their anti-internationalism presentations are generally\r\nmilk-and-water middle-of-the-roadism which is virtually meaningless.\r\nMost Councils-on-World-Affairs presentations give persuasive\r\ninternationalist propaganda.\r\n\r\nThus, the Foreign Policy Association, through its Councils on World\r\nAffairs--and another affiliated activity, the Great Decisions\r\nprogram--has managed to enroll some \"conservative\" community leadership\r\ninto an effective propaganda effort for one-world socialism.\r\n\r\nThe World Affairs Center was set up with national headquarters at 345\r\nEast 46th Street in New York City, as a formal affiliate of the Foreign\r\nPolicy Association, to handle the important job of directing the various\r\n\"independent\" Councils on World Affairs, located in major cities\r\nthroughout the nation. In March, 1960, the FPA merged with the World\r\nAffairs Center to form one organization: the Foreign Policy\r\nAssociation-World Affairs Center.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe FPA-WAC describes its Great Decisions program as an annual\r\nnation-wide review, by local groups under local sponsorship, of problems\r\naffecting United States Foreign Policy. FPA-WAC provides Fact Sheet\r\nKits, which contain reading material for these local discussion groups.\r\nThese kits present what FPA calls a \"common fund of information\" for all\r\nparticipants. They also provide an \"opinion\" ballot which permits each\r\nparticipant, at the end of the Great Decisions discussion program, to\r\nregister his viewpoint and send it to officials in Washington.\r\n\r\nThe old IPR line (fostering American policies which helped communists\r\ntake over China) was that the Chinese communists were not communists at\r\nall but democratic \"agrarian reformers\" whom the Chinese people loved\r\nand respected, and whom the Chinese people were going to install as the\r\nrulers of new China, regardless of what America did; and that,\r\ntherefore, it was in our best interest to be friendly with these\r\n\"agrarian reformers\" so that China would remain a friendly power once\r\nthe \"reformers\" took over.\r\n\r\nA major objective of the FPA-WAC--since it fell heir to the work of the\r\nIPR--is to foster American diplomatic recognition of red China.\r\n\r\nThe FPA-WAC, and its subordinate Councils on World Affairs, do this\r\npropaganda job most cleverly. Most FPA spokesmen (except a few like\r\nCyrus Eaton, who is a darling of the FPA and occasionally writes for its\r\npublications) are \"anti-communists\" who admit that the Chinese\r\ncommunists are real communists. They admit that it is not pleasant (in\r\nthe wake of our memories of Korea) to think of extending diplomatic\r\nrecognition to red China; and they do not always openly advocate such a\r\nmove; but their literature and Great Decisions operations and other\r\nactivities all subtly inculcate the idea that, however much we may\r\ndislike the Chinese communists, it is highly probable that we can best\r\npromote American interests by \"eventually\" recognizing red China.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, the FPA-WAC Great Decisions program for 1957 was\r\nespecially interesting. One question posed that year was \"Should U. S.\r\nDeal With Red China?\" Discussion of this topic was divided into four\r\ncorollary questions: _Why Two Chinas? What are Red China's goals? Does\r\nRed China threaten 'uncommitted' Asia? Red China's record--what U. S.\r\nPolicy?_\r\n\r\nThe FPA-WAC Fact Sheet Kit, which sets out background information for\r\nthe \"study\" and \"voting\" on the red China question, contains nothing\r\nthat would remind Americans of Chinese communist atrocities against our\r\nmen in Korea or in any way make Americans really angry at the\r\ncommunists. In the discussion of the \"two Chinas,\" the communists sound\r\nsomewhat more attractive than the nationalists. In the discussion of red\r\nChina's \"goals,\" there is nothing about the communist goal of enslaving\r\nall Asia; there are simply statistics showing how much more progress red\r\nChina has made than \"democratic\" India--with less outside help than\r\n\"democratic\" India has received from the United States.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion of whether red China threatens the rest of Asia, the\r\nFPA-WAC material makes no inference that the reds are an evil,\r\naggressive power--but it does let the reader know that the reds in China\r\nare a mighty military power that we must reckon with, in realistic\r\nterms. Nothing is said in the FPA-WAC Fact Sheet Kit about the\r\ncommunist rape of Tibet. Rather, one gets the impression that Tibet is\r\na normal, traditional province of China which has now returned to the\r\nhomeland.\r\n\r\nAfter studying the problems of communist China from this FPA-WAC \"Fact\r\nSheet,\" Great Decisions participants were given an opportunity to cast\r\nan \"Opinion Ballot\" on the four specific questions posed. The \"Opinions\"\r\nwere already written out on the FPA-WAC ballot. The voter had only to\r\nselect the opinion he liked best, and mark it. Here are the five choices\r\nof opinions given voters on the Foreign Policy Association's Great\r\nDecisions 1957 Opinion Ballot, concerning U. S. diplomatic recognition\r\nof red China.\r\n\r\n     \"a. Recognize Peiping now, because we can deal with Far East\r\n     political and other problems more easily if we have diplomatic\r\n     relations with Peiping.\r\n\r\n     \"b. Go slow on recognizing them but agree to further talks and, if\r\n     progress is made, be willing to grant recognition at some future\r\n     date.\r\n\r\n     \"c. Refuse to recognize them under any circumstances.\r\n\r\n     \"d. Acknowledge that the Peiping government is the effective\r\n     government of China (recognition _de facto_) and deal with it as\r\n     much as seems useful, on this basis, but avoid full diplomatic\r\n     relations for the present.\r\n\r\n     \"e. Other.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGeneral purposes of the Foreign Policy Association-World Affairs Center\r\nare rather well indicated in a fund-raising letter, mailed to American\r\nbusinessmen all over the nation, on February 23, 1961. The letter was on\r\nthe letterhead of Consolidated Foods Corporation, 135 South La Salle\r\nStreet, Chicago 3, Illinois, and was signed by Nathan Cummings, Chairman\r\nof the Board. Here is a part of Mr. Cummings' appeal to other\r\nbusinessmen to contribute money to the FPA-WAC:\r\n\r\n     \"In his inaugural address which I had the privilege of personally\r\n     hearing in Washington, President Kennedy summoned the American\r\n     people to responsibility in foreign policy: ...\r\n\r\n     \"This call for individual initiative by the President characterizes\r\n     the kind of citizen responsibility in world affairs which the\r\n     Foreign Policy Association-World Affairs Center has been\r\n     energetically trying to build since its founding in 1918....\r\n\r\n     \"The FPA-WAC's national program for informing the American public\r\n     of the urgent matters of foreign policy such as those mentioned by\r\n     the President--'the survival and the success of liberty,'\r\n     'inspection and control of arms,' the forging of 'a grand and\r\n     global alliance' to 'assure a more fruitful life for all\r\n     mankind'--is making remarkable progress.\r\n\r\n     \"The enclosed 'Memorandum: 1960-61' describes the program and past\r\n     achievement of this 42-year-old organization. Particularly worthy\r\n     of mention is their annual 'Great Decisions' program which last\r\n     year engaged more than a quarter of a million Americans in eight\r\n     weeks of discussion of U. S. foreign policy and reached hundreds of\r\n     thousands of others with related radio, television and newspaper\r\n     background programs and articles on these important topics.\r\n\r\n     \"Of the basic budget for 1960-61 of $1,140,700, nearly one-third\r\n     must be raised from individual and corporate sources to meet\r\n     minimal operating needs. The fact that over 400 major corporations,\r\n     some of whom contribute as much as $5,000, already support FPA-WAC\r\n     is evidence of the effectiveness and vitality of its educational\r\n     program....\r\n\r\n     \"I hope that you and your company will join ours in generously\r\n     supporting this work.\"\r\n\r\nErwin D. Canham, editor of _The Christian Science Monitor_, has\r\ncaustically denounced the American Legion Post in Atlanta for its\r\n\"attack\" on the FPA.\r\n\r\nMr. Canham, in a letter dated April 25, 1961, accused the American\r\nLegion Post of making a \"completely false\" statement when the Post\r\ncontended that Mr. Canham and the _Monitor_ advocated the seating of red\r\nChina in the UN. Mr. Canham said:\r\n\r\n     \"This newspaper's editorial policy has never espoused any such\r\n     position.\"\r\n\r\nI have in my file a letter which Mr. Canham wrote, April 29, 1960, as\r\neditor of _The Christian Science Monitor_, on the _Monitor's_\r\nletterhead. In this letter, Mr. Canham says:\r\n\r\n     \"I believe that the United States should open diplomatic relations\r\n     with communist China.\"\r\n\r\nThe interesting thing here is the coincidence of Mr. Canham's policy\r\nwith regard to red China, and the policy of the Foreign Policy\r\nAssociation-World Affairs Center.\r\n\r\nThe Great Decisions program for 1957 (discussed above) was obviously\r\nintended to lead Americans to acceptance of U. S. diplomatic recognition\r\nof red China. The same material, however, made it clear that the\r\ninvisible government was not yet advocating the seating of red China in\r\nthe UN! Do these backstairs formulators and managers of United States\r\nopinion and governmental policies have more respect for the UN than they\r\nhave for the US? Or, do they fear that bringing red China into the UN\r\n(before U. S. recognition) would finish discrediting that already\r\ndiscredited organization and cause the American people to demand\r\nAmerican withdrawal?\r\n\r\nChristian Scientists (through Mr. Canham and the _Monitor_), Protestants\r\n(through the National Council of Churches), Quakers (through the\r\nAmerican Friends Service Committee), and Jews (through the American\r\nJewish Committee, The Anti-Defamation League, and other organizations)\r\nare among the religious groups which have publicly supported activities\r\nof the Foreign Policy Association. Powerful Catholic personalities and\r\npublications have endorsed FPA work, too.\r\n\r\nOn December 9, 1959, The Right Rev. Timothy F. O'Leary, Superintendent\r\nof Catholic Schools for the Archdiocese of Boston, wrote to all Catholic\r\nschools in the district, telling them that he was making plans for their\r\nparticipation with the World Affairs Council and the Foreign Policy\r\nAssociation in the Great Decisions 1960 Program.\r\n\r\nOn November 27, 1960, _Our Sunday Visitor_ (largest and perhaps most\r\ninfluential Catholic newspaper in America) featured an article by Frank\r\nFolsom, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors of\r\nthe Radio Corporation of America, and a leading Catholic layman. Mr.\r\nFolsom was effusive in his praise of the FPA-WAC Great Decisions\r\nprogram.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe interlock between the Council on Foreign Relations and the Foreign\r\nPolicy Association-World Affairs Center can be seen in the list of\r\nofficers and directors of the FPA-WAC:\r\n\r\n     Eustace Seligman, Chairman of the FPA-WAC, is a partner in Sullivan\r\n     and Cromwell, the law firm of the late John Foster Dulles, a\r\n     leading CFR member.\r\n\r\n     John W. Nason, President of FPA-WAC, is a member of the Council on\r\n     Foreign Relations.\r\n\r\n     Walter H. Wheeler, Jr., President of Pitney-Bowes, Inc., is Vice\r\n     Chairman of FPA-WAC, and also a member of the CFR.\r\n\r\n     Gerald F. Beal, of the J. Henry Schroeder Banking Corporation of\r\n     New York, is Treasurer of FPA-WAC, and also a member of the Council\r\n     on Foreign Relations.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Andrew G. Carey is Secretary of FPA-WAC. Her husband is a\r\n     member of the CFR.\r\n\r\n     Emile E. Soubry, Executive Vice President and Director of the\r\n     Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, is Chairman of the Executive\r\n     Committee of FPA-WAC, and also a member of the CFR.\r\n\r\n     Benjamin J. Buttenwieser, of Kuhn, Loeb, and Company, in New York,\r\n     is a member of the Executive Committee of FPA-WAC, and also a\r\n     member of the CFR.\r\n\r\n     Joseph E. Johnson (old friend of Alger Hiss, who succeeded Hiss as\r\n     President of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace) is a\r\n     member of the Executive Committee of the FPA-WAC, and also a member\r\n     of the CFR.\r\n\r\n     Harold F. Linder, Vice Chairman of the General American Investors\r\n     Company, is a member of the Executive Committee of FPA-WAC, and\r\n     also a member of the CFR.\r\n\r\n     A. William Loos, Executive Director of the Church Peace Union, is a\r\n     member of the Executive Committee of the FPA-WAC. Mr. Loos attended\r\n     the CFR meeting with high communist party officials in the Soviet\r\n     Union in May, 1961.\r\n\r\n     Henry Siegbert, formerly a partner in the investment banking firm\r\n     of Adolph Lewisohn & Sons, is a member of the Executive Committee\r\n     of the FPA-WAC, and also a member of the CFR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 4\r\n\r\nCOMMITTEE FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn June 20, 1961, _The San Francisco Examiner_ published a United Press\r\nInternational news story with a June 19, Washington, D. C. date line,\r\nunder the headline \"J.F.K. Backs Tax Cut Plan.\"\r\n\r\nHere are portions of the article:\r\n\r\n     \"President Kennedy today urged Congress and the people to give a\r\n     close study to a monetary reform proposal which would empower him\r\n     to cut income taxes in recession periods.\r\n\r\n     \"He issued the statement after receiving a bulky report from the\r\n     Commission of [sic] Money and Credit....\r\n\r\n     \"The 27-member commission was set up in 1957 by the Committee for\r\n     Economic Development (CED). Its three-year study was financed by\r\n     $1.3 million in grants from the CED and the Ford and Merrill\r\n     Foundation.\r\n\r\n     \"One of the key recommendations was to give the President limited\r\n     power to cut the 20 percent tax rate on the first $2000 of personal\r\n     income, if needed to help the economy....\r\n\r\n     \"The report also recommended extensive changes in the Federal\r\n     Reserve System, set up in 1913 as the core of the Nation's banking\r\n     system....\"\r\n\r\nThis _San Francisco Examiner_ article is a classic example of propaganda\r\ndisguised as straight news reporting.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA story about the President supporting a plan for reducing taxes could\r\nnot fail to command sympathetic attention. But the truth is that the\r\ntax reform proposals of the Commission on Money and Credit would give\r\nthe President as much power and leeway to _raise_ taxes as to lower\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn its 282-page report, the Commission made 87 separate proposals. One\r\nwould permit the President (on his own initiative) to reduce the basic\r\nincome-tax rate (the one that applies to practically every person who\r\nhas any income at all) from 20% to 15%. It would also permit the\r\nPresident to raise the basic rate from 20% to 25%.\r\n\r\nThe idea of giving the President such power is as alien to American\r\npolitical principles as communism itself is. The proposed \"machinery\"\r\nfor granting such Presidential power would violate every basic principle\r\nof our constitutional system. Under the Commission's proposal, the\r\nPresident would announce that he was going to increase or decrease\r\ntaxes. If, within sixty days, Congress did not veto the plan, it would\r\nbecome law, effective for six months, at which time it would have to be\r\nrenewed by the same procedure. That is very similar to the Soviet way.\r\nIt could not be more foreign to the American way if it had been lifted\r\nfrom the Soviet constitution.\r\n\r\nOther proposals in the report of the Commission on Money and Credit,\r\nfiled on June 18, 1961, after a three-year study:\r\n\r\n     1. The Federal Reserve Act would be amended to give the President\r\n     control over the Federal Reserve System--which, as set up in 1913,\r\n     is supposed to be free of any kind of political control, from the\r\n     White House or elsewhere.\r\n\r\n     2. The Commission recommends elimination of the legal requirement\r\n     that the Federal Reserve System maintain a gold reserve as backing\r\n     for American currency. A bill was introduced in Congress (May 9,\r\n     1961, by U. S. Congressman Abraham Multer, New York Democrat) to\r\n     implement this Commission recommendation. The bill would take away\r\n     from American citizens twelve billion dollars in gold which\r\n     supports their own currency, and enable government to pour this\r\n     gold out to foreigners, as long as it lasts, leaving Americans with\r\n     a worthless currency, and at the mercy of foreign governments and\r\n     bankers (see the _Dan Smoot Report_, \"Gold and Treachery,\" May 22,\r\n     1961).\r\n\r\n     3. The banking laws of individual states would be ignored or\r\n     invalidated: banking laws of 33 states prohibit mutual savings\r\n     banks; the Commission on Money and Credit wants a federal law to\r\n     permit such banks in all states.\r\n\r\n     4. The Commission would circumvent, if not eliminate, state laws\r\n     governing the insurance industry: the Commission proposes a federal\r\n     law which would permit insurance companies to obtain federal\r\n     charters and claim federal, rather than state, regulation.\r\n\r\n     5. The Commission would subject all private pension funds to\r\n     federal supervision.\r\n\r\n     6. The Commission would abolish congressional limitations on the\r\n     size of the national debt--so that the debt could go as high as the\r\n     President pleased, without any interference from Congress.\r\n\r\n     7. The Commission recommends that Congress approve all federal\r\n     public works projects three years in advance, so that the President\r\n     could order the projects _when he felt_ the economy needed\r\n     stimulation.\r\n\r\nRemembering how President Kennedy and his administrative officials and\r\ncongressional leaders used political extortion and promises of bribes\r\nwith public money to force the House of Representatives, in January,\r\n1961, to pack the House Rules Committee, imagine how the President could\r\nwhip Congress, and the whole nation, into line if the President had just\r\n_some_ of the additional, unconstitutional power which the Commission on\r\nMoney and Credit wants him to have.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe objective of the Commission on Money and Credit (to finish the\r\nconversion of America into a total socialist state, under the\r\ndictatorship of whatever \"proletarian\" happens to be enthroned in the\r\nWhite House) can be seen, between the lines, in the Commission's remarks\r\nabout the \"formidable problem\" of unemployment.\r\n\r\nThe Commission wants unemployment to drop to the point where the number\r\nof jobless workers will equal the number of vacant jobs! And the clear\r\nimplication is that the federal government must adopt whatever policies\r\nnecessary to create this condition.\r\n\r\nSuch a condition can exist only in a slave system--like the socialist\r\nsystem of communist China where, for example, all \"farmers\" (men, women,\r\nand children) enjoy full employment; under the whips of overseers, on\r\nthe collective farms of communism.\r\n\r\nThe Commission on Money and Credit was created on November 21, 1957, by\r\nthe Committee for Economic Development (CED). In the 1957 Annual Report\r\nof the CED, Mr. Donald K. David, CED Chairman, gave the history of the\r\nCommission on Money and Credit. Mr. David said:\r\n\r\n     \"CED began nine years ago [1948] to call attention to the need for\r\n     a comprehensive reassessment of our entire system of money and\r\n     credit.\r\n\r\n     \"When the last such survey of the economic scene was made by the\r\n     Aldrich Commission in 1911, we had no central banking system, no\r\n     guaranteed deposits or guaranteed mortgages. There were no personal\r\n     or corporate income taxes; no group insurance plans, pension funds,\r\n     or Social Security system....\r\n\r\n     \"Although CED had envisaged a commission created by government, the\r\n     inability of government to obtain the consensus required for\r\n     launching the study became as apparent as the need for avoiding\r\n     further delay. So, after receiving encouragement from other\r\n     research institutions, leaders in Congress, the Administration, and\r\n     from various leaders in private life, CED's Trustees decided to\r\n     sponsor the effort, assisted by a grant from The Ford\r\n     Foundation....\"\r\n\r\nHere is the membership of the CED's Commission on Money and Credit:\r\n\r\n     Frazar B.

Shuman, President of the American\r\nFarm Bureau Federation, wrote me a letter, saying:\r\n\r\n     \"I was a member of the Commission on Money and Credit but you will\r\n     notice that I filed very strong objections to several of the\r\n     recommendations which you brought to the attention of your\r\n     readers. I do not agree with the Commission recommendations to\r\n     authorize the President of the United States to vary the rate of\r\n     income tax. Neither do I agree that the gold reserve requirement\r\n     should be abandoned. I agree with several of your criticisms of the\r\n     Report but I cannot agree that 'the objective of the Commission on\r\n     Money and Credit (to finish the conversion of America into a total\r\n     socialist state, under the dictatorship of whatever proletarian\r\n     happens to be enthroned in the White House) can be seen, between\r\n     the lines, in the Commission's remarks about the formidable problem\r\n     of unemployment.'\r\n\r\n     \"At its worst, it was a compromise of the divergent viewpoint of\r\n     the conservative and liberal members of the Commission.\"\r\n\r\nI will not argue with Mr. Shuman, an honest and honorable man, about the\r\nobjective of the Commission; but I will reassert the obvious:\r\nrecommendations of the Commission on Money and Credit, if fully\r\nimplemented, would finish the conversion of America into a total\r\nsocialist state.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs pointed out before, the various agencies which interlock with the\r\nCouncil on Foreign Relations do not have formal affiliation with the\r\nCouncil, or generally, with each other; but their effective togetherness\r\nis revealed by their unanimity of purpose: They are all working toward\r\nthe ultimate objective of creating a one-world socialist system and\r\nmaking America a part of it.\r\n\r\nThis ambitious scheme was first conceived and put into operation, during\r\nthe administrations of Woodrow Wilson, by Colonel Edward M. House, and\r\nby the powerful international bankers whom House influenced.\r\n\r\nHouse founded the Council on Foreign Relations for the purpose of\r\ncreating (and conditioning the American people to accept) what House\r\ncalled a \"positive\" foreign policy for America--a policy which would\r\nentwine the affairs of America with those of other nations until this\r\nnation would be sucked into a world-government arrangement.\r\n\r\nColonel House knew, however, that America could not become a province in\r\na one-world socialist system unless America's economy was first\r\nsocialized. Consequently, House laid the groundwork for \"positive\"\r\ndomestic policies of government too--policies which could gradually\r\nplace government in control of the nation's economy until, before the\r\npublic realized what was happening, we would already have a socialist\r\ndictatorship.\r\n\r\nThe following passages are from pages 152-157 of _The Intimate Papers of\r\nColonel House_:\r\n\r\n     \"The extent of Colonel House's influence upon the legislative plans\r\n     of the Administration [Wilson's] may be gathered from a remarkable\r\n     document.... In the autumn of 1912, immediately after the\r\n     presidential election [when Wilson was elected for his first term]\r\n     there was published a novel, or political romance, entitled _Philip\r\n     Dru: Administrator_.\r\n\r\n     \"It was the story of a young West Point graduate ... who was caught\r\n     by the spirit of revolt against the tyranny of privileged\r\n     interests. A stupid and reactionary government at Washington\r\n     provokes armed rebellion, in which Dru joins whole-heartedly and\r\n     which he ultimately leads to complete success. He himself becomes a\r\n     dictator and proceeds by ordinance to remake the mechanism of\r\n     government, to reform the basic laws that determine the relation of\r\n     the classes, to remodel the defensive forces of the republic, and\r\n     to bring about an international grouping or league of powers....\r\n\r\n     \"Five years after its publication, an enterprising bookseller,\r\n     noting the growing influence of House in the Wilson Administration,\r\n     wrote with regard to the book: 'As time goes on the interest in it\r\n     becomes more intense, due to the fact that so many of the ideas\r\n     expressed by _Philip Dru: Administrator_, have become laws of this\r\n     Republic, and so many of his ideas have been discussed as becoming\r\n     laws.... Is Colonel E. M. House of Texas the author?' ...\r\n\r\n     \"Colonel House was, in truth, the author....\r\n\r\n     \"'Philip Dru' ... gives us an insight into the main political and\r\n     social principles that actuated House in his companionship with\r\n     President Wilson. Through it runs the note of social democracy\r\n     reminiscent of Louis Blanc and the revolutionaries of 1848....\r\n\r\n     \"Through the book also runs the idea that in the United States,\r\n     government is unresponsive to popular desires--a 'negative'\r\n     government, House calls it....\r\n\r\n     \"The specific measures enacted by Philip Dru as Administrator of\r\n     the nation, indicated the reforms desired by House.\r\n\r\n     \"The Administrator appointed a 'board composed of economists ...\r\n     who ... were instructed to work out a tariff law which would\r\n     contemplate the abolition of the theory of protection as a\r\n     governmental policy.'\r\n\r\n     \"'The Administrator further directed the tax board to work out a\r\n     graduated income tax....\r\n\r\n     \"Philip Dru also provided for the 'formulation of a new banking\r\n     law, affording a flexible currency bottomed largely upon commercial\r\n     assets.... He also proposed making corporations share with the\r\n     government and states a certain part of their earnings....\r\n\r\n     \"'Labor is no longer to be classed as an inert commodity to be\r\n     bought and sold by the law of supply and demand.'\r\n\r\n     \"Dru 'prepared an old age pension law and also a laborer's\r\n     insurance law....'\r\n\r\n     \"'He had incorporated in the Franchise Law the right of Labor to\r\n     have one representative upon the boards of corporations and to\r\n     share a certain percentage of the earnings above the wages, after a\r\n     reasonable percent upon the capital had been earned. In turn, it\r\n     was to be obligatory upon them (the laborers) not to strike, but to\r\n     submit all grievances to arbitration.'\"\r\n\r\nNeed it be pointed out that \"Louis Blanc and the revolutionaries of\r\n1848,\" on whom Colonel House patterned his plan for remaking America,\r\nhad a scheme for the world virtually identical with that of Karl Marx\r\nand Frederick Engles--those socialist revolutionaries who wrote the\r\n_Communist Manifesto_ in 1848?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1918, Franklin K. Lane, Woodrow Wilson's Secretary of the Interior,\r\nin a private letter, wrote, concerning the influence of 'Philip Dru' on\r\nPresident Wilson:\r\n\r\n     \"All that book has said should be, comes about.... The President\r\n     comes to _Philip Dru_, in the end.\"\r\n\r\nThe _end_ is a socialist dictatorship of the proletariat, identical with\r\nthat which now exists in the Soviet Union. We have already \"come to\" a\r\nmajor portion of Colonel House's program for us. The unrealized portions\r\nof the program are now promises in the platforms of both our major\r\npolitical parties, they are in the legislative proposals of the\r\nAdministration in power and of its leaders in Congress; they are the\r\nobjectives of the Council on Foreign Relations, whose members occupy key\r\nposts in Government, from the Presidency downward, and who dominate a\r\nvast network of influential, tax-exempt \"educational\" agencies, whose\r\nrole is to \"educate\" the Congress and the people to accept the total\r\nsocialist program for America.\r\n\r\nThe Committee for Economic Development (which created the Commission on\r\nMoney and Credit) is the major propaganda arm of the Council on Foreign\r\nRelations, in the important work of socializing the American economy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPaul G.

Hoffman, in 1939, conceived\r\nthe idea of setting up a tax-exempt \"economic committee\" which would\r\nprepare new economic policies for the nation and then prepare the public\r\nand Congress to accept them.\r\n\r\nHoffman founded the Committee for Economic Development in 1942. The\r\norganization was incorporated in September of that year, with Paul G.\r\nHoffman as Chairman. Major offices in the Committee for Economic\r\nDevelopment have always been occupied by members of the Council on\r\nForeign Relations--persons who generally have important positions in\r\nmany other interlocking organizations, in the foundations, in the big\r\ncorporations which finance the great interlock, and/or in government.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere are the Council on Foreign Relations members who joined Paul\r\nHoffman in setting up the CED in 1942:\r\n\r\n     William Benton (former U.S. Senator, now Chairman of the Board of\r\n     _Encyclopaedia Britannica_; former Assistant Secretary of State;\r\n     Trustee and former Vice President, University of Chicago)\r\n\r\n     Will L.

Petersen, Chairman of the CED's Subcommittee on Economic\r\nDevelopment Assistance (and a member of the Council on Foreign\r\nRelations) said that his committee originated the idea of creating the\r\nDevelopment Loan Fund, which was authorized by Congress in Section 6 of\r\nthe Foreign Aid Bill of 1957, which Eisenhower established by Executive\r\nOrder on December 13, 1957, and which may be the most sinister step ever\r\ntaken by the internationalist foreign-aid lobby.\r\n\r\nIn 1956, when President Eisenhower requested an appropriation of\r\n$4,860,000,000 for foreign aid, he asked Congress to authorize foreign\r\naid commitments for the next ten years. Congress refused the ten-year\r\nplan. In 1957, the internationalists' ideal of a _permanent_\r\nauthorization for foreign aid was wrapped up in the Development Loan\r\nFund scheme.\r\n\r\nOnly a few Congressmen raised any question about it. Below are passages\r\ntaken from the _Congressional Record_ of July 15, 1957, the day the\r\nDevelopment Loan Fund was discussed in the House.\r\n\r\nCongressman A. S. J. Carnahan (Democrat, Missouri) floor manager for the\r\nForeign Aid Bill, rose to explain Section 6, which established the\r\nDevelopment Loan Fund, saying:\r\n\r\n     \"The United States, in order to provide effective assistance [to\r\n     all underdeveloped countries of the world] ... must have available\r\n     a substantial fund upon which it can draw. The fund must be large\r\n     enough so that all of the underdeveloped nations of the free world\r\n     will feel that they will have an opportunity to participate in it.\r\n\r\n     \"We cannot wisely say that we should make a small amount available\r\n     the first year and see how things work out. If we are able to offer\r\n     assistance only to the select few, we will inevitably antagonize\r\n     many other countries whose future friendship and cooperation will\r\n     be important to us ... in addition to an initial authorization of\r\n     an appropriation of $500 million, the bill includes authorization\r\n     for borrowing from the Treasury $500 million beginning in fiscal\r\n     1959, and an additional $500 million beginning in fiscal 1960.\"\r\n\r\nThus, Congressman Carnahan, arguing for foreign aid, outlined some of\r\nthe absurd fallacies of foreign aid: namely, if we give foreign aid at\r\nall, we must provide enough so that every foreign government in the\r\nworld will always be able to get all it wants. We can exercise no choice\r\nin whom we give or lend our money to. If we give only \"to the select\r\nfew\" we offend all others.\r\n\r\nCongressman H. R. Gross (Republican, Iowa) asked a question:\r\n\r\n     \"What interest rate will be charged upon the loans that are to be\r\n     made?\"\r\n\r\nCongressman Carnahan:\r\n\r\n     \"The legislation does not designate the interest rate.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gross:\r\n\r\n     \"What will be the length of the loan to be made?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Carnahan:\r\n\r\n     \"The legislation does not designate the length of the loans. The\r\n     rules for the loans, which will determine the interest rates, the\r\n     length of time the loans will run, the size of the installment\r\n     repayments, and other administrative details, will be taken care of\r\n     by the Executive Department.\"\r\n\r\nCongressman John L. Pilcher (Democrat, Georgia) made the point that the\r\nmanager of the Development Loan Fund, appointed by the President, could\r\nlend money to:\r\n\r\n     \"any foreign government or foreign government agency, to any\r\n     corporation, any individual or any group of persons.\"\r\n\r\nCongressman Carnahan:\r\n\r\n     \"That is correct.\"\r\n\r\nCongressman Pilcher:\r\n\r\n     \"In other words, it would be possible for an individual to borrow\r\n     $1 million or $5 million to set up some business in some foreign\r\n     country, if the manager so agreed; is that correct?\"\r\n\r\nCongressman Carnahan:\r\n\r\n     \"If they met the criteria set up for loans.\"\r\n\r\nCongressman Pilcher:\r\n\r\n     \"The manager ... has the authority to collect or compromise any\r\n     obligation in this fund. In other words, he can make a loan this\r\n     month and if he so desires he can turn around and compromise it or\r\n     cancel it next month which is a straight out grant in the disguise\r\n     of a soft-loan program.\"\r\n\r\nCongressman Porter Hardy, Jr. (Democrat, Virginia) said:\r\n\r\n     \"The manager of the Fund has almost unlimited authority to do\r\n     anything he pleases.\"\r\n\r\nCongressman Barratt O'Hara (Democrat, Illinois), trying to quiet fears\r\nthat this bill was granting unlimited, uncontrollable power to some\r\nappointed manager, said that the blank-check grant of authority was not\r\nreally being made to the fund manager at all. The power was being given\r\nto the President of the United States, and the manager would merely\r\n\"perform such functions with respect to this title as the President may\r\ndirect.\"\r\n\r\nCongressman Gross said:\r\n\r\n     \"That is more power than any President should ask for or want the\r\n     responsibility for.\"\r\n\r\nCongressman Leon H. Gavin (Republican, Pennsylvania) pointed out that we\r\nalready have 5 or 6 lending agencies in this field: The International\r\nCo-operation Administration; the Export-Import Bank; the International\r\nBank; the International Monetary Fund; the International Development\r\nCorporation; and the World Bank. Why, then, do we need this new one, the\r\nDevelopment Loan Fund?\r\n\r\nCongressman Walter H. Judd (Republican, Minnesota) had already answered\r\nthat question, explaining that Development Loan Fund money would go to\r\nforeigners who could not qualify for loans from other agencies.\r\n\r\nCongressman Gross said that all foreign nations which will borrow from\r\nthis Fund could get all the American private capital they need if they\r\nhad political systems which made lending to them sensible or feasible.\r\n\r\nIn short, the Development Loan Fund (which the Committee for Economic\r\nDevelopment boasts paternity of) is a scheme for giving American tax\r\nmoney to foreigners who have proven themselves such poor credit risks\r\nthat they cannot obtain loans even from other governmental and UN\r\nagencies--and who will use the money to line their own pockets and to\r\nbuild socialistic enterprises which will eliminate possibilities of\r\nfreedom in their own land, and will compete in world markets with\r\nAmerican enterprise.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn its 1957 annual report, the CED also boasted about the work of its\r\nArea Development Committee. At that time, the two leading members of\r\nthis particular committee of the CED (who were also members of the\r\nCouncil on Foreign Relations) were Mr. Stanley Marcus, President of\r\nNeiman-Marcus Co., in Dallas; and the late Dr. Beardsley Ruml, widely\r\nknown New Deal socialist \"economist.\" Mr. Jervis J. Babb, Chairman of\r\nthe CED's Area Development Committee (President of Lever Brothers\r\nCompany) said:\r\n\r\n     \"The new area development program, approved by the Trustees [of\r\n     CED] at their May [1957] meeting in Chicago is underway....\r\n     Already, close relationships have been established with\r\n     organizations, both public and private, that are conducting\r\n     research and administering programs relating to area\r\n     development....\r\n\r\n     \"Five of CED's College-Community Research Centers ... have been\r\n     selected as a starting point of CED's area development pilot\r\n     projects. The five centers are: Boston, Utica, Alabama, Arkansas,\r\n     and Oklahoma.\"\r\n\r\nThe CED's Area Development work has brought CED personnel into close\r\ncooperation with the collection of tax-exempt \"municipal planning\"\r\norganizations housed in a Rockefeller-financed center at 1313 East 60th\r\nStreet, Chicago, which has become national headquarters for the\r\nproduction and placement of experts--who fabricate \"progressive\"\r\nlegislation for government at all levels; who rewrite our \"archaic\"\r\nstate constitutions; and who take over as city managers, or county\r\nmanagers, or metropolitan managers, or regional managers whenever people\r\nin any locality have progressed to the point of accepting government by\r\nimported experts as a substitute for government by elected local\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nIn other words, through the Area Development activities of the Committee\r\nfor Economic Development, the invisible government of America--the\r\nCouncil on Foreign Relations--has a hand in the powerful drive for\r\nMetropolitan Government. Metropolitan Government, as conceived by\r\nsocialist planners, would destroy the whole fabric of government and\r\nsocial organization in the United States.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMetropolitan Government would eliminate the individual states as\r\nmeaningful political entities, would divide the nation into metropolitan\r\nregions sprawling across state lines, and would place the management of\r\nthese regional governments in the hands of appointed experts answerable\r\nnot to local citizens but to the supreme political power in Washington.\r\n(For detailed discussion, see _The Dan Smoot Report_, April 13 and 20,\r\n1959, \"Metropolitan Government--Part One,\" and \"Metropolitan\r\nGovernment--Part Two.\")\r\n\r\nThrough the Area Development activities of the Committee for Economic\r\nDevelopment, the Council on Foreign Relations has supported the Urban\r\nRenewal program.\r\n\r\nUrban Renewal with federal tax money was authorized in the National\r\nHousing Act of 1949, and enlarged in scope by amendments to the Housing\r\nActs of 1954, 1956, and 1957; but it did not become a vigorously\r\npromoted nationwide program until late 1957, after the Council on\r\nForeign Relations (through the CED) started pushing it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUrban Renewal is a federally financed program of city planning which\r\nrequires city governments to seize homes and other private property from\r\nsome citizens and re-sell them, at below cost, to real estate promoters\r\nand other private citizens for developments that the city planners\r\nconsider desirable.\r\n\r\nUnder the ancient, but awesome, right of eminent domain, city\r\ngovernments do not have the power to take private real estate from one\r\ncitizen for the profit of another citizen. But in November, 1954, the\r\nSupreme Court in an urban renewal case, said that Congress and state\r\nlegislature can do anything they like to the private property of private\r\ncitizens as long as they claim they are doing it for public good.\r\n\r\nFederal urban renewal has opened rich veins of public money for graft,\r\ncorruption, and political vote buying; and it is destroying private\r\nproperty rights under the pretext that clearing slums will eliminate the\r\ncauses of crime. Moreover, urban renewal authorizes the seizure not just\r\nof slum property, but of all private property in a whole section of a\r\ncity, for resale to private interests which promise to build something\r\nthat governmental planners will like.\r\n\r\nFederal urban renewal--since the Council on Foreign Relation's CED\r\nstarted supporting it--has become a national movement with frightful\r\nimplications and dangers. (For detailed discussion of urban renewal, see\r\n_The Dan Smoot Report_, September 29, 1958, and October 6, 1958.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn its 1957 Annual Report, the Committee for Economic Development gave\r\ndetails on its educational work in public schools and colleges. This\r\nwork was, at that time, carried on primarily by the CED's\r\nBusiness-Education Committee, and by two subsidiary operations which\r\nthat Committee created: the College-Community Research Centers and the\r\nJoint Council on Economic Education. From the 1957 Annual Report of the\r\nCommittee for Economic Development:\r\n\r\n     \"CED's efforts to promote and improve economic education in the\r\n     schools are of special appeal to those who are concerned ... both\r\n     with education and the progress of the free enterprise system. The\r\n     Business-Education program and the numerous College-Community\r\n     Research Centers it has sponsored, together with the use of CED\r\n     publications as teaching materials, represent an important\r\n     contribution to economic education on the college level.\r\n\r\n     \"In the primary and secondary schools, the introduction of\r\n     economics into teaching programs is moving forward steadily, thanks\r\n     largely to the Joint Council on Economic Education which CED helped\r\n     to establish and continues to support....\r\n\r\n     \"The Business-Education Committee continued in 1957 its work with\r\n     the College-Community Research Centers and with the Joint Council\r\n     on Economic Education.\r\n\r\n     \"The Joint Council's program to improve the teaching of economics\r\n     in the public schools is now operating in 39 states, and the 25\r\n     college-community research centers active last year brought to more\r\n     than 3000 the number of business and academic men who have worked\r\n     together on economic research projects of local and regional\r\n     importance....\r\n\r\n     \"In its work, the committee [Business-Education Committee] is\r\n     finding especially valuable the experience gained through the\r\n     operation of the College-Community Research Centers. These centers\r\n     are financed partly by CED, partly by the Fund for Adult Education\r\n     [a Ford Foundation operation] and partly by locally-raised\r\n     funds....\r\n\r\n     \"The Joint Council [on Economic Education] is making excellent\r\n     progress in training teachers and incorporating economics education\r\n     in all grade levels of public school systems. In addition to its\r\n     national service programs, the Council has developed strong local\r\n     or state councils which not only help guide its work but last year\r\n     raised more than $500,000 to finance local projects.\r\n\r\n     \"CED helped to establish and works closely with this independent\r\n     organization [Joint Council on Economic Education] which is now\r\n     conducting four major types of activities.\r\n\r\n     \"1. _Summer Workshops for Teachers._ These working sessions,\r\n     sponsored by colleges and universities, provide three weeks\r\n     training in economics and develop ways to incorporate economics\r\n     into the school curriculum. Over 19,000 persons have participated\r\n     since the program began.\r\n\r\n     \"2. _Cooperating School Program._ Twenty school systems are working\r\n     with the Joint Council [on Economic Education] to demonstrate how\r\n     economics can be incorporated into the present curriculum....\r\n\r\n     \"3. _College Program._ Few students majoring in education now take\r\n     economics courses; therefore, 20 leading institutions are working\r\n     with the Joint Council [on Economic Education] to develop better\r\n     training in economics for prospective teachers....\r\n\r\n     \"4. _High School-Community Projects._ The Joint Council [on\r\n     Economic Education] is helping to conduct demonstration programs\r\n     which show how students can use community resources to improve\r\n     their economics education. For example, the Whittier, California\r\n     school system conducted a six-week program to help high school\r\n     seniors understand the kind of economy in which they would live and\r\n     work. They joined in research studies on regional economic problems\r\n     being carried on by the Southern California College-Community\r\n     research center....\"\r\n\r\nThe Committee for Economic Development claims that its educational work\r\nin economics is dedicated to progress of free enterprise; and many of\r\nits programs in schools and colleges are educational; but its subtle and\r\nrelentless emphasis is on the governmental interventionism that is the\r\nessence of New-Dealism, Fair-Dealism, Modern-Republicanism, and\r\nNew-Frontierism--the governmental interventionism prescribed long ago as\r\nthe way to socialize the economy of America in preparation for\r\nintegrating this nation into a worldwide socialist system.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPaul Hoffman's CED has come a long way since 1942. In 1957, the CED's\r\nCollege-Community Research Centers had \"Projects in Progress\" in 33\r\ninstitutions of higher learning:\r\n\r\n     Bates College, Boston College, Boston University, Bowdoin College,\r\n     Brown University, Colby College, Dartmouth College, Emory\r\n     University, Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration,\r\n     Iowa State College, Lewis & Clark College, McGill University,\r\n     Northeastern University, Northwestern University, Occidental\r\n     College, Pomona College, Reed College, Rutgers University, Southern\r\n     Methodist University, Tulane University, University of Alabama,\r\n     University of Arkansas, University of Iowa, University of Maine,\r\n     University of Michigan, University of Minnesota, University of\r\n     North Carolina, University of Oklahoma, University of Pennsylvania,\r\n     University of Washington, University of Wisconsin, Utica College of\r\n     Syracuse University, and Washington University.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1957, the following institutions of higher learning were\r\nparticipating in the CED's Joint Council on Economic Education \"College\r\nProgram\" to develop training in economics for prospective teachers:\r\n\r\n     Brigham Young University, George Peabody College for Teachers,\r\n     Indiana University, Montclair State Teachers College, New York\r\n     University, Ohio State University, Oklahoma A & M College,\r\n     Pennsylvania State University, Purdue University, Syracuse\r\n     University, Teachers College of Columbia University, University of\r\n     Colorado, University of Connecticut, University of Illinois,\r\n     University of Iowa, University of Minnesota, University of Southern\r\n     California, University of Tennessee, University of Texas,\r\n     University of Washington.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1957, the following 20 school systems were working in the CED's Joint\r\nCouncil on Economic Education \"Cooperating School Program,\" to\r\ndemonstrate how economics can be incorporated in the school curriculum,\r\nbeginning in the first grade:\r\n\r\n     Akron, Ohio; Albion, Illinois; Chattanooga, Tennessee; Colton,\r\n     California; Dayton, Ohio; Fort Dodge, Iowa; Hartford, Connecticut;\r\n     Kalamazoo, Michigan; Lexington, Alabama; Minneapolis, Minnesota;\r\n     New York City, New York; Portland, Oregon; Providence, Rhode\r\n     Island; Ridgewood, New Jersey; Seattle, Washington; Syracuse, New\r\n     York; University City, Missouri; Webster Groves, Missouri; West\r\n     Hartford, Connecticut; Whittier, California.\r\n\r\nAs indicated, the Business-Education Committee of the CED is the select\r\ngroup which supervises this vast \"educational\" effort reaching into\r\npublic schools, colleges, and communities throughout the nation:\r\n\r\n     _James L. Allen_, Senior Partner of Booz, Allen & Hamilton; _Jervis\r\n     J. Babb_, Chairman of the Board of Lever Brothers, Company; _Sarah\r\n     G. Blanding_, President of Vassar College; _W. Harold Brenton_,\r\n     President of Brenton Brothers, Inc.; _James F. Brownlee_, former\r\n     government official who is Chairman of the Board of the Minute Maid\r\n     Corporation, and a director of many other large corporations, such\r\n     as American Sugar Refining Co., Bank of Manhattan, Gillette Safety\r\n     Razor, R.

Watson, Jr._, President of\r\n     International Business Machines Corporation; _J. Cameron Thomson_,\r\n     Chairman of the Board of Northwest Bancorporation.\r\n\r\nNote that three of these CED Business-Education Committee\r\nmembers--Conant, Dickey, and Marcus--are influential members of the\r\nCouncil on Foreign Relations and have many connections with the big\r\nfoundations financing the great CFR interlock.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn addition to the educational work which it discusses in its 1957\r\nAnnual Report, the Committee for Economic Development utilizes many\r\nother means to inject its (and the CFR's) economic philosophies into\r\ncommunity thought-streams throughout the nation.\r\n\r\nHere, for example, are passages from a news story in _The Dallas Morning\r\nNews_, June 30, 1953:\r\n\r\n     \"Dallas businessmen and Southern Methodist University officials\r\n     Monday [June 29] launched a $25,000 business research project\r\n     financed through agencies of the Ford Foundation.\r\n\r\n     \"Stanley Marcus of Dallas, a national trustee of Ford Foundation's\r\n     Committee for Economic Development, said the project would go on\r\n     two or three years under foundation funds. After that ... the City\r\n     might foot the bill....\r\n\r\n     \"The SMU project--along with several others like it throughout the\r\n     nation--is designed to foster study in regional and local business\r\n     problems, Marcus commented.\r\n\r\n     \"Here's how the Dallas project will work:\r\n\r\n     \"A business executive committee, composed of some of Dallas' top\r\n     businessmen, will be selected. These men then will select a group\r\n     of younger executives for a business executive research committee.\r\n     This will be the working group, Marcus explained....\r\n\r\n     \"At SMU, several of the schools' chief officials will act as a\r\n     senior faculty committee.... Acting as co-ordinator for the project\r\n     will be Warren A. Law ... who soon will get his doctorate in\r\n     economics from Harvard University.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"experimental\" stage of this Business Executives Research Committee\r\nlasted five years in Dallas. During that time, the researchers filed two\r\nmajor reports: an innocuous one in 1955 concerning traffic and transit\r\nproblems in Dallas; and a most significant one in 1956, strongly urging\r\nmetropolitan government for Dallas County, patterned after the metro\r\nsystem in Toronto, Canada.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn October, 1958, Dr. Donald K. David, then Chairman of the Committee\r\nfor Economic Development and Vice Chairman of the Ford Foundation (and\r\nalso a member of the Council on Foreign Relations) went to Dallas to\r\nspeak to the Citizens Council, an organization composed of leading\r\nDallas business executives, whose president that year was Stanley\r\nMarcus.\r\n\r\nDr. David told the business men that they should give greater support\r\nand leadership to the government's foreign aid program; and, of course,\r\nhe urged vast expansion of foreign aid, particularly to \"underdeveloped\r\nnations.\"\r\n\r\nThat was the signal and the build-up. The next month--November,\r\n1958--the experimental Business Executives Research Committee, which the\r\nCED had formed in 1953 and which had already completed its mission with\r\nits report and recommendation on metropolitan government for Dallas, was\r\nconverted into \"The Dallas CED Associates.\"\r\n\r\nHere is a news story about that event, taken from the November 11, 1958,\r\n_Dallas Morning News_:\r\n\r\n     \"A Dallas Committee for Economic Development--the first of its kind\r\n     in the nation--has been founded at Southern Methodist University.\r\n     It will give voice to Southwestern opinions--and knowledge--on\r\n     economic, matters or international importance. Keystone will be an\r\n     economic research center to be established soon at SMU.\r\n\r\n     \"A steering group composed of Dallas and Southwestern business,\r\n     industrial and educational leaders laid the groundwork for both\r\n     committee and center in a weekend meeting at SMU.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"steering group\" included George McGhee and Neil Mallon.\r\n\r\nMr. McGhee (presently Assistant Secretary of State for Policy Planning)\r\nis, and has been for many years, a member of the Council on Foreign\r\nRelations.\r\n\r\nNeil Mallon, then Chairman of the Board of Dresser Industries and a\r\nformer official of the Foreign Policy Association, founded the Dallas\r\nCouncil on World Affairs in 1951. Dresser Industries is one of the big\r\ncorporations which contribute money to the Council on Foreign Relations.\r\n\r\nIn the group with Mr. McGhee and Mr. Mallon were five SMU officials, a\r\nDallas banker, a real estate man, and Stanley Marcus, the head man in\r\nthe \"steering group\" which set up the Dallas Associates of the Committee\r\nfor Economic Development.\r\n\r\nThe first literary product of the Dallas Associates of the CED--at\r\nleast, the first to come to my attention--is a most expensive-looking\r\n14-page printed booklet entitled \"The Role of Private Enterprise in the\r\nEconomic Development of Underdeveloped Nations.\" The title page reveals\r\nthat this pamphlet is a policy statement of The Dallas Associates of\r\nCED. It is little more than a rewrite of the speech which Dr. Donald K.\r\nDavid had made to the Dallas Citizens Council in November, 1958, urging\r\nbusiness to give support and leadership to the government's foreign aid\r\nprograms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 5\r\n\r\nBUSINESS ADVISORY COUNCIL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereas the Foreign Policy Association-World Affairs Center is primarily\r\ninterested in fostering the _foreign_ policy desired by the CFR, and the\r\nCommittee for Economic Development is primarily interested in\r\nformulating economic and other policies which, through governmental\r\ncontrols, will lead us into total socialism--another, smaller (but, in\r\nsome ways, more powerful) organization has (or, until mid-1961, had) the\r\nprimary responsibility of infiltrating government: of selecting men whom\r\nthe CFR wants in particular jobs, and of formulating, inside the\r\nagencies of government, policies which the CFR wants. This small but\r\nmighty organization was the Business Advisory Council.\r\n\r\nDaniel C. Roper, F. D. Roosevelt's Secretary of Commerce, formed the\r\nBusiness Advisory Council on June 26, 1933. Roper set it up as a panel\r\nof big businessmen to act as unofficial advisers to President Roosevelt.\r\nHe was disappointed in it, however. The biggest businessmen in America\r\ndid, indeed, join; but they did not support the total New Deal as Roper\r\nhad expected they would when he made them \"advisers.\"\r\n\r\nRoper, however, was a figurehead. The brains behind the formation of the\r\nBusiness Advisory Council were in the head of Sidney J. Weinberg, Senior\r\nPartner of the New York investment house of Goldman, Sachs & Co.--and\r\nalso on the boards of directors of about thirty of the biggest\r\ncorporations in America. Weinberg helped organize the BAC. He recruited\r\nmost of its key members. He was content to let America's big businessmen\r\nripen for a while in the sunshine of the New Deal's \"new\" philosophy of\r\ngovernment, before expecting them to give that philosophy full support.\r\n\r\nSecretary of Commerce Daniel C. Roper pouted and ignored the Business\r\nAdvisory Council when he discovered that the big businessmen, enrolled\r\nas governmental \"advisors,\" tried to advise things that governmental\r\nleaders did not like. But Sidney Weinberg was shrewd, and had a\r\ndefinite, long-range plan for the Business Advisory Council. He held the\r\nBAC together as a kind of social club, keeping the big business men\r\nunder constant exposure to the \"new\" economic philosophies of the New\r\nDeal, waiting for the propitious moment to enlist America's leading\r\ncapitalists on the side of the socialist revolutionaries, determined to\r\ndestroy capitalism and create a one-world socialist society.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe right time came in 1939, when World War II started in Europe and\r\nRoosevelt developed his incurable ambition to get in that war and become\r\nPresident of the World. Plans for America's frenzied spending on\r\nnational defense began in 1939. With mammoth government contracts in the\r\noffing, Weinberg had no trouble converting the Business Advisory Council\r\nof leading businessmen into an agency for helping governmental leaders\r\nplan the policies for war and for the post-war period.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn September, 1960, _Harper's Magazine_ published an article by Hobart\r\nRowen, entitled \"America's Most Powerful Private Club,\" with a\r\nsub-title, \"How a semi-social organization of the very biggest\r\nbusinessmen--discreetly shielded from public scrutiny--is 'advising' the\r\ngovernment on its top policy decisions.\" Here are passages from the\r\narticle:\r\n\r\n     \"The Business Advisory Council meets regularly with government\r\n     officials six times a year.... On two of these six occasions ...\r\n     the BAC convenes its sessions at plush resorts, and with a\r\n     half-dozen or more important Washington officials and their wives\r\n     as its guests, it indulges in a three-day 'work and play'\r\n     meeting....\r\n\r\n     \"The guest list is always impressive: on occasion, there have been\r\n     more Cabinet officers at a ... BAC meeting than were left in the\r\n     Capital....\r\n\r\n     \"These meetings cost the BAC anywhere from $6,000 to $12,000 or\r\n     more, paid out of the dues of members ... which have been judged\r\n     tax-deductible by the Internal Revenue Service....\r\n\r\n     \"After the 1952 election, the BAC was having its fall 'work and\r\n     play' meeting at the Cloister, just off the Georgia coast and a\r\n     short distance from Augusta, where Ike was alternating golf with\r\n     planning his first-term Cabinet. [Sidney] Weinberg and [General\r\n     Lucius D.] Clay [members of the BAC executive committee] ...\r\n     hustled ... to Augusta, conferred with Ike [a 'close, intimate,\r\n     personal friend' of both men]....\r\n\r\n     \"The result was historic: Ike tapped three of the BAC leaders ...\r\n     for his Cabinet. They were Charles E. Wilson of General Motors as\r\n     Defense Secretary; [George M.] Humphrey, then boss of the M. A.\r\n     Hanna Co., as Treasury Secretary; and Robert T. Stevens of the J.\r\n     P. Stevens & Co., as Army Secretary....\r\n\r\n     \"Afterwards, [Secretary] Humphrey himself dipped into the BAC pool\r\n     for Marion Folsom of Eastman Kodak as Under Secretary of the\r\n     Treasury [later Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare]....\r\n\r\n     \"Membership in the Council gives a select few the chance to bring\r\n     their views to bear on key government people, in a most pleasant,\r\n     convivial, and private atmosphere....\r\n\r\n     \"The BAC, powerful in its composition and with an inside track, is\r\n     thus a special force. An intimation of its influence can be gleaned\r\n     from its role in the McCarthy case.... BAC helped push Senator Joe\r\n     McCarthy over the brink in 1954, by supplying a bit of backbone to\r\n     the Eisenhower Administration at the right time. McCarthy's chief\r\n     target in the Army-McCarthy hearings was the aforementioned Robert\r\n     T. Stevens--a big wheel in the BAC who had become Secretary of the\r\n     Army. The BAC didn't pay much--if any--attention to Joe McCarthy as\r\n     a social menace until he started to pick on Bob Stevens. Then, they\r\n     burned up.\r\n\r\n     \"During the May 1954 meeting at the Homestead [expensive resort\r\n     hotel in Hot Springs, Virginia, where the BAC often holds its 'work\r\n     and play' sessions with high government officials and their wives],\r\n     Stevens flew down from Washington for a weekend reprieve from his\r\n     televised torture. A special delegation of BAC officials made it a\r\n     point to journey from the hotel to the mountaintop airport to greet\r\n     Stevens. He was escorted into the lobby like a conquering hero.\r\n     Then, publicly, one member of the BAC after another roasted the\r\n     Eisenhower Administration for its McCarthy-appeasement policy. The\r\n     BAC's attitude gave the Administration some courage, and shortly\r\n     thereafter former Senator Ralph Flanders (a Republican and BAC\r\n     member) introduced a Senate resolution calling for censure.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nActive membership in the Business Advisory Council is limited to about\r\n70.

Blough announced that the Business Advisory\r\nCouncil had changed its name to Business Council; had severed its\r\nconnection with the Commerce Department; and would in the future give\r\nits consultative services to any governmental agency that asked for\r\nthem. The BAC had been under intense criticism for the expensive\r\nentertainment it had been giving to governmental officials it advised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 6\r\n\r\nADVERTISING COUNCIL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Advertising Council, 25 West 45th Street, New York 36, N. Y. (with\r\noffices at 203 North Wabash Avenue, Chicago; 1200 18th Street, N. W.,\r\nWashington; 425 Bush Street, San Francisco) serves as a public relations\r\noperation to promote selected projects supported by the Council on\r\nForeign Relations and its interlocking affiliates.\r\n\r\nThe Advertising Council was created in 1942 (then called War Advertising\r\nCouncil) as a tax-exempt, non-governmental agency to promote wartime\r\nprograms of government: rationing, salvage, the selling of war bonds,\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\nThe Advertising Council's specific job was to effect close cooperation\r\nbetween governmental agencies and business firms using the media of mass\r\ncommunication. A governmental agency would bring a particular project\r\n(rationing, for example) to the Advertising Council, for help in\r\n\"selling\" the project to the public. The Council would enlist the aid of\r\nsome advertising agency. The agency (giving its services for nothing, as\r\na contribution to the war effort) would prepare signs, newspaper mats,\r\nadvertising layouts, broadcasting kits and what not. The Advertising\r\nCouncil might then enlist the free services of a public relations firm\r\nto get this material into newspapers and magazines; get it inserted in\r\nthe regular ads of business firms; get it broadcast, free, as\r\npublic-service spot announcements by radio networks; get it inserted\r\ninto regular commercials on radio broadcasts; get slogans and art work\r\nstamped on the envelopes and business forms of corporations.\r\n\r\nThe Advertising Council rendered a valuable service to advertisers,\r\nbroadcasting organizations, and publishers. Everyone wanted to support\r\nprojects that would help the war effort. The Advertising Council did the\r\nimportant job of screening--of presenting projects which were legitimate\r\nand urgent.\r\n\r\nEven the advertising agencies and public relations firms, which\r\ncontributed free services, profited from the arrangement. They earned\r\nexperience and prestige as agencies which had prepared nationally\r\nsuccessful campaigns.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Advertising Council continued after the war to perform this same\r\nservice--selecting, for free promotion, projects that are \"importantly\r\nin the public interest.\" Indeed, the service is more valued in peace\r\ntime than in war by many advertisers and broadcasting officials who are\r\nbadgered to support countless causes and campaigns, most of which sound\r\ngood but some of which may be objectionable. Investigating to screen the\r\ngood from the bad is a major job. The Advertising Council does this job.\r\nThe Council is respected by industry, by the public, and by government.\r\nIt is safe to promote a project which the Advertising Council claims to\r\nbe \"importantly in the public interest.\"\r\n\r\nThus, officials of the Advertising Council have become czars in a most\r\nimportant field. They arbitrarily decide what is, and what is not, in\r\nthe public interest. When the Advertising Council \"accepts\" a project,\r\nthe most proficient experts in the world--leading Madison Avenue\r\npeople--go to work, without charge, to create (and saturate the media of\r\nmass communication with) the skillful propaganda that \"sells\" the\r\nproject to the public.\r\n\r\nOfficials of the Advertising Council are aware of their power as\r\nmoulders of public opinion. Theodore S. Repplier, head of the\r\nAdvertising Council, was quoted in a June, 1961, issue of _Saturday\r\nReview_, as saying:\r\n\r\n     \"There are Washington officials hired to collect figures on about\r\n     every known occupation, to worry about the oil and miners under the\r\n     ground, the rain in the sky, the wildlife in the woods, and the\r\n     fish in the streams--but it is nobody's job to worry about\r\n     America's state of mind, or whether Americans misread a situation\r\n     in a way that could be tragic.\r\n\r\n     \"This is a dangerous vacuum. But it is also a vacuum which explains\r\n     to a considerable degree the important position the Advertising\r\n     Council holds in American life today.\"\r\n\r\nNote, particularly, that the Advertising Council is responsible to no\r\none. If a business firm should decide on its own to include some \"public\r\nservice\" project in its advertising, and the project evoked public\r\nindignation, the business firm would lose customers. The Advertising\r\nCouncil has no customers to please. Yet, the Advertising Council is a\r\nprivate agency, beyond the reach of voter and taxpayer indignation\r\nwhich, theoretically, can exercise some control over public agencies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWho are these autocrats who have become so powerful that they can\r\ncondition, if not control, public opinion? They are the members of the\r\nPublic Policy Committee of the Advertising Council. Here were the 19\r\nmembers of the Advertising Council's Committee, on June 23, 1958:\r\n\r\n     _Sarah Gibson Blanding_, President of Vassar College; _Ralph J.\r\n     Bunche_, United Nations Under Secretary; _Benjamin J.\r\n     Buttenwieser_, partner in Kuhn, Loeb & Co.; _Olive Clapper,_\r\n     publicist; _Evans Clark_, member of the _New York Times_ editorial\r\n     board; _Helen Hall_, Director of Henry Street Settlement; _Paul G.\r\n     Hoffman_, Chairman of this Public Policy Committee; _Charles S.\r\n     Jones_, President of Richfield Oil Corporation; _Lawrence A.\r\n     Kimpton_, Chancellor of University of Chicago; _A. E. Lyon_,\r\n     Executive Secretary of the Railway Labor Executives Association;\r\n     _John J. McCloy_, Chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank; _Eugene\r\n     Meyer_, Chairman of the _Washington Post & Times-Herald_; _William\r\n     I. Myers_, Dean of Agriculture at Cornell University; _Elmo Roper_,\r\n     public opinion analyst; _Howard A. Rusk_, New York University\r\n     Bellevue Medical Center; _Boris Shishkin_, Assistant to the\r\n     President of AFL-CIO; _George N. Shuster_, President of Hunter\r\n     College; _Thomas J. Watson, Jr._, President of International\r\n     Business Machines Corporation; _Henry M. Wriston_, Executive\r\n     Director of the American Assembly.\r\n\r\nOf these 19, 8 are members of the Council on Foreign Relations--Bunche,\r\nButtenwieser, Hoffman, McCloy, Roper, Shishkin, Shuster, Wriston. The\r\nremaining 11 are mostly \"second level\" affiliates of the CFR, or under\r\nthe thumb of CFR members in the business world.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome Advertising Council projects really are \"in the public interest.\"\r\nThe \"Stop Accidents\" campaign and the \"Smokey Bear\" campaign to prevent\r\nforest fires are among several which probably have done much good.\r\n\r\nThere has never been an Advertising Council project which insinuated\r\nanything to remind anyone of the basic American political idea written\r\ninto our organic documents of government--the idea that men are endowed\r\nby God with inalienable rights; that the greatest threat to those rights\r\nis the government under which men live; and that government, while\r\nnecessary to secure the God-given blessings of liberty, must be\r\ncarefully limited in power by an inviolable Constitution. But there have\r\nbeen many Advertising Council projects which were vehicles for the\r\npropaganda of international socialism.\r\n\r\nThe Advertising Council has promoted Law Day, which is an annual\r\noccasion for inundating America with \"World Peace Through World Law\"\r\npropaganda, designed to prepare the people for giving the World Court\r\njurisdiction over American affairs, as a major step toward world\r\ngovernment (see _The Dan Smoot Report_, September 14, 1959, \"The World\r\nCourt\").\r\n\r\nThe Advertising Council has promoted the \"mental health\" project, which,\r\nsuperficially, appears to be an admirable effort to make the public\r\naware of the truth that we have more mentally ill people than we have\r\nfacilities for--but whose underlying, and dubious, purpose is to promote\r\nthe passage, in all states, of \"mental health\" laws fabricated by\r\ninternational socialists in the World Health Organization and in the U.\r\nS. Public Health Service. These laws, to \"facilitate access to hospital\r\ncare\" for mentally ill people, provide no new facilities, prescribe no\r\nbetter treatment, nor do anything else to relieve the suffering of sick\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe new \"mental health\" laws, which the Advertising Council is helping\r\nto persuade people in all states to accept, eliminate the constitutional\r\nsafeguards of a person accused of being mentally ill, thus making it\r\neasier for bureaucrats, political enemies and selfish relatives to\r\ncommit him and get him out of the way.\r\n\r\nThe Advertising Council has touted ACTION--American Council to Improve\r\nOur Neighborhoods, Box 462, Radio City Station, New York 20, N. Y.--an\r\norganization for urban renewal. Of the 66 persons on the ACTION Board of\r\nDirectors, a controlling majority are:\r\n\r\n     known members of the Council on Foreign Relations--such as Philip\r\n     L. Graham and Stanley Marcus;\r\n\r\n     known members of important CFR affiliates--such as, Sidney Weinberg\r\n     of the Business Advisory Council;\r\n\r\n     union bosses like Harry C. Bates, Ben Fischer, Joseph D. Keenan,\r\n     Jacob S. Potofsky, Walter Reuther;\r\n\r\n     bureaucrats in charge of various \"Housing Authorities,\" including\r\n     Dr. Robert Weaver, Kennedy's present Housing Administrator whose\r\n     appointment was challenged in the Senate because of Dr. Weaver's\r\n     alleged communist front record;\r\n\r\n     \"liberal\" politicians dedicated to the total socialist\r\n     revolution--such as, Joseph S. Clark, Jr., U. S. Senator from\r\n     Pennsylvania;\r\n\r\n     officials of construction and real estate firms which can make\r\n     mammoth profits on urban renewal projects and who are also\r\n     \"liberal\" in their support of all governmental controls and\r\n     subsidies, the tools for converting capitalism into socialism--such\r\n     as, William Zeckendorf;\r\n\r\n     representatives of organizations also \"liberal\" in the sense\r\n     indicated above--such as, Philip M. Klutznick of B'nai B'rith, and\r\n     Mrs. Kathryn H. Stone of the League of Women Voters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Advertising Council supports United Nations propaganda.\r\n\r\nThe 1959 annual report of the United States Committee for the United\r\nNations pays special tribute to the \"radio-TV campaign, conducted\r\nthrough the cooperation of the Advertising Council and the National\r\nAssociation of Broadcasters.\" Here are some passages, from this tribute,\r\nwhich show how the Advertising Council gets one-world socialist\r\npropaganda into millions of American homes:\r\n\r\n     \"Perry Como read the UN spot personally to his audience of\r\n     33,000,000.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Jack Paar ... [showed] a filmed visit to the UN by his daughter,\r\n     Randy ... following a splendid statement [by Paar]. This 7-minute\r\n     segment of the show reached a minimum of 30,000,000 viewers.\"\r\n\r\n     \"The campaign received tremendous recognition also on Meet the\r\n     Press, the Today Show, I Love Lucy, the Desilu Playhouse, and the\r\n     Jack Benny Show, among many others.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Broadcast kits went out to every radio and television station in\r\n     the country.\"\r\n\r\nA recent accomplishment of the Advertising Council was its saturation\r\nbombing (1961) of the American public with propaganda in support of\r\nKennedy's Youth Peace Corps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 7\r\n\r\nUNITED NATIONS AND WORLD GOVERNMENT PROPAGANDA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll American advocates of _supra_-national government, or world\r\ngovernment, claim their principal motive is to achieve world peace. Yet,\r\nthese are generally the same Americans whose eager interventionism\r\nhelped push America into the two world wars of this century.\r\n\r\nThe propaganda for involving America in the bloodshed and hatreds of\r\nEurope--in World War I and World War II--was the same as that now being\r\nused to push us into world government. In World War I, we rushed our\r\nsoldiers across the wide seas to die in the cause of making the world\r\nsafe for democracy--of eliminating evil in the world so that there would\r\nnot be any more war! This was precisely what the world-government\r\ninterventionists wanted us to do. The so-called American isolationists\r\nwere _not_ pacifists who recommended refusal to take up arms in defense\r\nof their own country: most of them were patriots who would have been\r\namong the foremost to fight in defense of America. Being intelligent\r\ncitizens of a peaceful and civilized nation, they wanted to keep it that\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThe world-government interventionists used the extraordinary arguments\r\nof a man who, though living in an orderly and law-abiding neighborhood,\r\nsays that he must go carousing around in adjoining communities and get\r\ninvolved in every street fight and barroom brawl he can find in order to\r\navoid violence! Such a man not only becomes a party to lawless violence\r\nwhich he claims to deplore, but also creates hatreds and resentments\r\nwhich will ultimately bring to the sane citizens of his own peaceful\r\nneighborhood the evils which they had managed to keep out.\r\n\r\nThis is what Woodrow Wilson's intervention in World War I did to the\r\nUnited States. It sacrificed the lives of 250,000 American men--not to\r\nmention the hundreds of thousands crippled and otherwise wrecked by war.\r\nBut this sacrifice of American youth did not make the world safe for\r\nanything. It helped make the world a breeding place for communism,\r\nfascism, naziism, and other varieties of socialism; and it planted the\r\nseeds for a second world war more destructive than the first.\r\n\r\nBut the world-government interventionists--when their bloody crusade\r\nproved worse than a tragic failure--did not admit error. They tried to\r\nplace all the blame on the isolationists who had tried to keep us from\r\nmaking the ghastly mistake.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf we had stayed out of World War I, the European powers would have\r\narrived, as they have been doing for thousands of years, at some kind of\r\nnegotiated peace which would have saved not only hundreds of thousands\r\nof American lives, but millions of European lives as well. By entering\r\nWorld War I, we merely converted it into total war, prolonged it, and\r\nmade it more savage.\r\n\r\nThe destruction and slaughter of World War I created power vacuums and\r\nimbalances and economic chaos, which inevitably led to World War II.\r\n\r\nAgain, the world-government advocates, who claimed to want peace,\r\ninsisted that we go to war. They also intensified their efforts to\r\nentangle America, irretrievably, in political and economic union with\r\nEuropean nations so that there would never again be any _possibility_ of\r\nthe United States staying out of the endless wars and turmoil of the old\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIt is, perhaps, fruitless to question the motives of people leading the\r\ncampaign to push America into world government. All organizations which\r\nhave been active in this movement--World Fellowship, Inc., Federal\r\nUnion, Inc., Atlantic Union Committee, United World Federalists, and so\r\non--have had a sprinkling of communist-fronters among their directors\r\nand members. But they have also had the official support of many\r\nprominent and respected Americans: Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, John\r\nKennedy, Richard Nixon, Estes Kefauver, John Sparkman, Adlai Stevenson,\r\nDean Acheson, John Foster Dulles, Christian Herter, cabinet officers;\r\nsenators and congressmen; Supreme Court justices; prominent churchmen,\r\nbusinessmen, financiers, entertainers, judges, union officials;\r\nnewspaper and magazine editors; famous columnists and radio-television\r\ncommentators.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough the cry of \"peace\" is the perennial clarion call of all\r\nworld-government advocates, many of them have, in recent years, added\r\nthe claim that their recommendations (for converting America into a\r\nprovince of world government) are means of \"fighting communism.\" Indeed,\r\nsome of the most vigorous advocates of one-worldism have wide\r\nreputations as anti-communists--Walter Judd, a Republican Congressman\r\nfrom Minnesota, for example. Even Clarence Streit (leader of the\r\nnow-defunct Federal Union, Inc., and father of that organization's very\r\nactive and influential tax-exempt successor, Atlantic Union Committee)\r\nhas ugly things to say about communism.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that every step the United States takes toward political and\r\neconomic entanglements with the rest of the world is a step toward\r\nrealization of _the_ end objective of communism: creating a one-world\r\nsocialist political and economic system in which we will be one of the\r\nsubjugated provinces.\r\n\r\nBecause of the wealth we have created as a free and independent nation,\r\nwe would be the most heavily taxed province in any conceivable\r\nsupra-national government--whether in a \"limited, federal union of the\r\nwestern democracies,\" which is what the Atlantic Union Committee people\r\nsay they want; or in a total one-world system, which is what _all_\r\nadvocates of international union really have as their final goal.\r\n\r\nBecause of our population, however, we would have minority\r\nrepresentation in any supra-national government now being planned.\r\n\r\nAmericans would be subjected to laws enacted by an international\r\nparliament in which we would have little influence; taxing us,\r\nregulating our economic activities, controlling our schools, and\r\ndictating our social and cultural relations with each other and with the\r\nrest of the world.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmerica was founded, populated, and developed by people seeking escape\r\nfrom oppressive governments in Europe. Now our own leaders ask us to\r\ngive up the freedom and independence which our forebears won for us with\r\nblood and toil and valorous devotion to high ideals, to become subjects\r\nin a governmental system that would inevitably be more tyrannical than\r\nany which our forefathers rebelled against or any that presently exist.\r\nIf the world government included the despotic and oligarchic and\r\nmilitaristic, and feudalistic and primitive systems of Asia, the Middle\r\nEast, Africa, and Latin America, it would necessarily become the\r\nbloodiest and most oppressive tyranny the world has ever known.\r\n\r\nNowadays, when two or more nations amalgamate their economic, political,\r\nand social systems they necessarily take the lowest common denominator\r\nof freedom rather than the highest. In fact, they must take something\r\nlower than the lowest: the union government will be more restrictive\r\nthan the government of any of the nations which formed the union.\r\n\r\nThis will be true of _any_ _supra_-national government that the United\r\nStates might get into: the union will not extend American freedom to\r\nother nations; it will extend to all nations in the union the most\r\nrestrictive controls of the most oppressive government which enters the\r\nunion, and make even those controls worse than they were before the\r\nunion was formed--because the American principle of federalism has been\r\ndiscarded by the \"liberals\" who manage our national affairs; and\r\nAmerican federalism is the only political principle ever to exist in the\r\nhistory of the world that can make individual human freedom possible in\r\na federation of states.\r\n\r\nHard core American communists know (and some admit) that any move toward\r\nAmerican membership in any kind of supra-national government is a move\r\ntoward the Soviet objective of a one-world socialist dictatorship; but\r\nall other American advocates of international union claim their schemes\r\nare intended to repeat and extend the marvelous achievement of 13\r\nAmerican states which, by forming a political union, created a free and\r\npowerful nation.\r\n\r\nAll United States advocates of any kind of world government point to the\r\nfounding of America: 13 sovereign states, each one proud and\r\nnationalistic, all with special interests that were divergent from or in\r\nconflict with the interests of the others; yet, they managed to\r\nsurrender enough sovereignty to join a federal union which gave the\r\nunited strength of all, while retaining the individuality and freedom of\r\neach.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe 13 American states, in forming a federal union, did not take the\r\nlowest common denominator of freedom; they took the highest, and\r\nelevated that.\r\n\r\nThe American principle of federalism (indeed, the whole American\r\nconstitutional system) grew out of the philosophical doctrine (or,\r\nrather, statement of faith) which Jefferson wrote into the Declaration\r\nof Independence:\r\n\r\n     \"_...all men are ... endowed by their Creator with certain\r\n     inalienable rights..._\"\r\n\r\nMen get their rights from God, not from government. Government, a\r\nman-made creature, has nothing except what it takes from God-created\r\nmen. Government can give the people nothing that it has not first taken\r\naway from them. Hence, if man is to remain free, he must have a\r\ngovernment which will play a very limited and negative role in his\r\nprivate affairs.\r\n\r\nThe United States is the only nation, ever, whose institutions and\r\norganic law were founded on this principle. The United Nations'\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights; the Constitution of the Soviet Union; and\r\nthe written and unwritten constitutions of every other nation in the\r\nworld are all built on a political principle exactly opposite in meaning\r\nto the basic principle of Americanism. That is, the Constitution of the\r\nSoviet Union, and of every UN agency, and of all other nations, specify\r\na large number of rights and privileges which citizens should have, if\r\npossible, and which _government_ will grant them _if_ government can,\r\nand _if_ government thinks proper.\r\n\r\nContrast this with the American Constitution and Bill of Rights which do\r\nnot contain one statement or inference that the federal government has\r\nany responsibility, or power, to grant the people rights, privileges, or\r\nbenefits of any kind. The total emphasis in these American documents is\r\non telling the federal government _what it cannot do_ to and for the\r\npeople--on ordering the federal government to stay out of the private\r\naffairs of citizens and to leave their God-given rights alone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis negative, restricted role of the federal government, and this\r\nassumption that God and not government is the source of man's rights\r\nand privileges, are clearly stated in the Preamble to our Constitution.\r\nThe Preamble says that this Constitution is being _ordained_ and\r\nestablished, not to _grant_ liberties to the people, but to _secure_ the\r\nliberties which the people already had (before the government was ever\r\nformed) as _blessings_.\r\n\r\nThe essence of the American constitutional system, which made freedom in\r\na federal union possible, is clearly stated in the first sentence of the\r\nfirst Article of our Constitution and in the last Article (the Tenth\r\nAmendment) of our Bill of Rights.\r\n\r\nThe first Article of our Constitution begins with the phrase, \"All\r\nlegislative Powers _herein_ granted....\" That obviously meant the\r\nfederal government had no powers which were not granted to it by the\r\nConstitution. The Tenth Amendment restates the same thing with emphasis:\r\n\r\n     \"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution,\r\n     nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States\r\n     respectively, or to the people.\"\r\n\r\nClearly and emphatically, our Constitution says that the federal\r\ngovernment cannot legally do anything which is not authorized by a\r\nspecific grant of power in the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThis is the one constitutional concept that made the American\r\ngovernmental system different from all others; it is the one which left\r\nour people so free and unmolested by their own government that they\r\nconverted the backward, American continent into the land of freedom, the\r\nmost fruitful and powerful nation in history.\r\n\r\nAnd this was the constitutional proviso which created the American\r\nprinciple of federalism. The Constitution made no grant, or even\r\ninferred a grant, of power to the federal government for meddling, to\r\nany extent, or for any purpose whatever, in the private cultural,\r\neconomic, social, educational, religious, or political affairs of\r\nindividual citizens--or in the legitimate governmental activities of\r\nthe individual states which became members of the federal union. Hence,\r\nstates could join the federal union without sacrificing the freedom of\r\ntheir citizens.\r\n\r\nModern \"liberalism\" which has been continuously in control of the\r\nfederal government (and of most opinion-forming institutions and media\r\nthroughout our society) since Franklin D. Roosevelt's first\r\ninauguration, March 4, 1933, has, by ignoring constitutional restraints,\r\nchanged our _Federal_ government with _limited_ powers into a _Central_\r\ngovernment with _limitless_ power over the individual states and their\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nModern \"liberalism\" has abandoned American constitutional government and\r\nreplaced it with democratic centralism, which, in _fundamental theory,\r\nis identical_ with the democratic centralism of the Soviet Union, and of\r\nevery other major nation existing today.\r\n\r\nIt was possible to enlarge the size of the old American federal union\r\nwithout diminishing freedom for the people. When you enlarge the land\r\narea and population controlled by democratic centralism you must\r\nnecessarily diminish freedom for the people, because the problems of\r\ncentralized government increase with the size of population and area\r\nwhich it controls.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLook at what has happened to America since our _federal_ government was\r\nconverted into a centralized absolutism. The central government in\r\nWashington arrogated to itself the unconstitutional power and\r\nresponsibility of regulating the relationships between private employers\r\nand their employees, enacting laws which established \"collective\r\nbargaining\" as \"national policy,\" and which, to that end, gave\r\ninternational unions a virtual monopoly over large segments of the labor\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nIt follows that a minor labor dispute between two unions on the\r\nwaterfront of New York is no longer a concern only of the people and\r\npolice in that neighborhood. A handful of union members who have no\r\ngrievance whatever against their employers but who are in a\r\njurisdictional struggle with another union, can shut down the greatest\r\nrailroad systems in the world, throw thousands out of work, and paralyze\r\nvital transportation for business firms and millions of citizens all\r\nover the nation.\r\n\r\nHarry Bridges on the West Coast can order a political demonstration\r\nhaving nothing to do with \"labor\" matters, and paralyze the economy of\r\nhalf the nation.\r\n\r\nImagine what it will be like if we join a world government. Then a dock\r\nstrike in London will cripple, not just the British Isles but the whole\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nNow, the central government in Washington sends troops into local\r\ncommunities to enforce, at bayonet point, the illegal edicts of a\r\nWashington judicial oligarchy concerning the operation of local schools.\r\nIf we join world government, the edict and the troops will come\r\n(depending on what nations are in the international union, of course)\r\nfrom India and Japan and the Congo.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was a time when Americans, learning of suffering and want in a\r\ndistant land, could respond to their Christian promptings and native\r\nkindliness by making voluntary contributions for relief to their fellow\r\nhuman beings abroad. Our central government's foreign aid programs have\r\nalready taken much of that freedom away from American citizens--taxing\r\nthem so heavily for what government wants to give away, that private\r\ncitizens can't spend their own money the way they would like to.\r\n\r\nWhat will it be like if we join a world government that embraces the\r\nreal have-not nations of the earth? The impoverished subcontinent of\r\nIndia, because of population, would have more representatives in the\r\ninternational parliament than we would have. They, with the support of\r\nrepresentatives from Latin America and Africa, could easily vote to lay\r\na tax on \"surplus\" incomes for the benefit of all illiterate and hungry\r\npeople everywhere; and outvoted Americans would be the only people in\r\nthe world with incomes high enough to meet the international definition\r\nof \"surplus.\"\r\n\r\nWe read with horror of Soviet slaughter in Hungary when the Soviets\r\nsuppress a local rebellion against their partial world-government. What\r\nkind of horror would we feel after we join a world government and see\r\ntroops from Europe and Africa and the Middle East machinegunning people\r\non the streets of United States cities in order to suppress a rebellion\r\nof young Americans who somehow heard about the magnificent\r\nconstitutional system and glorious freedom their fathers used to have\r\nand who are trying to make a public demonstration of protest against the\r\ninternational tyranny being imposed upon them?\r\n\r\nA genuine world government might eliminate the armed conflict (between\r\nnations) which we now call war; but it would cause an endless series of\r\nbloody uprisings and bloody suppressions, and would cause more human\r\nmisery than total war itself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1936, the Communist International formally presented its three-stage\r\nplan for achieving world government--_Stage 1:_ socialize the economies\r\nof all nations, particularly the Western \"capitalistic democracies\"\r\n(most particularly, the United States); _Stage 2:_ bring about federal\r\nunions of various groupings of these socialized nations; _Stage 3:_\r\namalgamate all of the federal unions into one world-wide union of\r\nsocialist states. The following passage is from the official program of\r\nthe 1936 Communist International:\r\n\r\n     \"...dictatorship can be established only by a victory of\r\n     socialism in different countries or groups of countries, after\r\n     which the proletariat republics would unite on federal lines with\r\n     those already in existence, and this system of federal unions would\r\n     expand ... at length forming the World Union of Socialist Soviet\r\n     Republics.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1939 (three years after this communist program was outlined) Clarence\r\nK. Streit (a Rhodes scholar who was foreign correspondent for _The New\r\nYork Times_, covering League of Nations activities from 1929-1939) wrote\r\n_Union Now_, a book advocating a gradual approach through regional\r\nunions to final world union--an approach identical with that of the\r\ncommunists, except that Streit did not say his scheme was intended to\r\nachieve world dictatorship, and did not characterize the end result of\r\nhis scheme as a \"World Union of Socialist Soviet Republics.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1940, Clarence K. Streit (together with Percival F. Brundage, later a\r\nDirector of the Budget for Eisenhower; and Melvin Ryder, publisher of\r\nthe _Army Times_) formed Federal Union, Inc., to work for the goals\r\noutlined in Streit's book, _Union Now_, published the year before.\r\n\r\nIn 1941, Streit published another book: _Union Now With Britain_. He\r\nclaims that the union he advocated would be a step toward \"formation of\r\nfree world government.\" But the arguments of his book make it very clear\r\nthat in joining a union with other nations, the United States would not\r\nbring to the union old American constitutional concepts of\r\nfree-enterprise and individual freedom under limited government, but\r\nwould rather amalgamate with the socialistic-communistic systems that\r\nexist in the other nations which became members of the union.\r\n\r\nThe following passages are from page 192 of Streit's _Union Now With\r\nBritain_:\r\n\r\n     \"Democrats cannot ... quarrel with Soviet Russia or any other\r\n     nation because of its economic collectivism, for democracy itself\r\n     introduced the idea of collective machinery into politics. It is a\r\n     profound mistake to identify democracy and Union necessarily or\r\n     entirely with either capitalist or socialist society, with either\r\n     the method of individual or collective enterprise. There is room\r\n     for both of these methods in democracy....\r\n\r\n     \"Democracy not only allows mankind to choose freely between\r\n     capitalism and collectivism, but it includes marxist governments,\r\n     parties and press....\"\r\n\r\nWhen the year 1941 ended, America was in World War II; and all American\r\nadvocates of world-peace-through-world-law-and-world-government\r\njubilantly struck while the iron was hot--using the hysteria and\r\nconfusion of the early days of our involvement in the great catastrophe\r\nas a means of pushing us into one or another of the schemes for union\r\nwith other nations.\r\n\r\nClarence Streit states it this way, in his most recent book (_Freedom's\r\nFrontier Atlantic Union Now_, 1961):\r\n\r\n     \"Japan Pearl Harbored us into the war we had sought to avoid by\r\n     disunion.... Now, we Americans had the white heat of war to help\r\n     leaders form the nuclear Atlantic Union.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn January 5, 1942 (when we had been at war less than a month), Clarence\r\nStreit's Federal Union, Inc., bought advertising space in major\r\nnewspapers for a petition urging Congress to adopt a joint resolution\r\nfavoring immediate union of the United States with several specified\r\nforeign nations. Such people as Harold L. Ickes (Roosevelt cabinet\r\nofficer), Owen J. Roberts (Supreme Court Justice), and John Foster\r\nDulles (later Eisenhower's Secretary of State) signed this newspaper ad\r\npetitioning Congress to drag America into world government. In fact,\r\nthese notables (especially John Foster Dulles) had actually written the\r\nJoint Resolution which Federal Union wanted Congress to adopt.\r\n\r\nThe world government resolution (urged upon Congress in January, 1942)\r\nprovided among other things that in the federal union of nations to be\r\nformed, the \"union\" government would have the right: (1) to impose a\r\ncommon citizenship; (2) to tax citizens directly; (3) to make and\r\nenforce all laws; (4) to coin and borrow money; (5) to have a monopoly\r\non all armed forces; and (6) to _admit new members_.\r\n\r\nThe following is from a Federal Union, Inc., ad published in _The\r\nWashington Evening Star_, January 5, 1942, urging upon the people and\r\nCongress of America an immediate plunge into world government:\r\n\r\n     \"....Resolved:\r\n\r\n     \"That the President of the United States submit to Congress a\r\n     program for forming a powerful union of free peoples to win the\r\n     war, the peace, the future;\r\n\r\n     \"That this program unite our people, on the broad lines of our\r\n     Constitution, with the people of Canada, the United Kingdom, Eire,\r\n     Australia, New Zealand, and the Union of South Africa, together\r\n     with such other free peoples, both in the Old World and the New as\r\n     may be found ready and able to unite on this federal basis....\r\n\r\n     \"We gain from the fact that all the Soviet republics are already\r\n     united in one government, as are also all the Chinese-speaking\r\n     people, once so divided. Surely, we and they must agree that union\r\n     now of the democracies wherever possible is equally to the general\r\n     advantage....\r\n\r\n     \"Let us begin now a world United States....\r\n\r\n     \"The surest way to shorten and to win this war is also the surest\r\n     way to guarantee to ourselves, and our friends and foes, that this\r\n     war will end in a union of the free. The surest way to do all this\r\n     is for us to start that union now.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWorld Fellowship, Inc., was also busy putting pressure on Congress in\r\nJanuary, 1942. World Fellowship, Inc., is one of the oldest world\r\ngovernment organizations. It was founded in 1918 as the \"League of\r\nNeighbors.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1924, the League of Neighbors united with the Union of East and West\r\n(which had been founded in India). In 1933, this combined organization\r\nreorganized and changed its name to World Fellowship of Faiths. In late\r\n1941, it changed its name again and incorporated--and has operated since\r\nthat time as World Fellowship, Inc.\r\n\r\nDr. Willard Uphaus, a notorious communist-fronter, has been Executive\r\nDirector of World Fellowship, Inc., since February, 1953. Here is a\r\nJoint Resolution which World Fellowship, Inc., urged Congress to adopt\r\non or before January 30, 1942--as a _birthday present_ to President\r\nFranklin D. Roosevelt.\r\n\r\n     \"Now, therefore, be it\r\n\r\n     \"Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\n     States of America, in Congress assembled, That the Congress of the\r\n     United States of America does hereby solemnly declare that all\r\n     peoples of the earth should now be united in a commonwealth of\r\n     nations to be known as the United Nations of the World, and to that\r\n     end it hereby gives to the President of the United States of\r\n     America all the needed authority and powers of every kind and\r\n     description, without limitations of any kind that are necessary in\r\n     his sole and absolute discretion to set up and create the\r\n     Federation of the World, a world peace government under the title\r\n     of the 'United Nations of the World,' including its constitution\r\n     and personnel and all other matters needed or appertaining thereto\r\n     to the end that all nations of the world may by voluntary action\r\n     become a part thereof under the same terms and conditions.\r\n\r\n     \"There is hereby authorised to be appropriated, out of any money in\r\n     the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, the sum of 100 million\r\n     dollars or so much thereof as may be necessary, to be expended by\r\n     the President in his sole and absolute discretion, to effectuate\r\n     the purposes of this joint resolution, and in addition, the sum of\r\n     1 billion dollars for the immediate use of the United Nations of\r\n     the World under its constitution as set up and created by the\r\n     President of the United States of America as provided in this joint\r\n     resolution....\"\r\n\r\nCongress rejected the world-government resolutions urged upon it in 1942\r\nby Federal Union, Inc., and by World Fellowship, Inc.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut the formation of the United Nations in 1945 was a tremendous step in\r\nthe direction these two organizations were travelling. The \"world peace\"\r\naspects of the United Nations were emphasized to enlist support of the\r\nAmerican public. Few Americans noticed that the UN Charter really\r\ncreates a worldwide social, cultural, economic, educational, and\r\npolitical alliance--and commits each member nation to a program of total\r\nsocialism for itself and to the support of total socialism for all other\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nThe United Nations is, to be sure, a weaker alliance than world\r\ngovernment advocates want; but the UN was the starting point and\r\nframework for world government.\r\n\r\nThe massive UN propaganda during the first few years after the formation\r\nof the UN (1945) was so effective in brainwashing the American people,\r\nthat the United World Federalists, beginning with the State Assembly of\r\nCalifornia, managed to get 27 state legislatures to pass resolutions\r\ndemanding that Congress call a Constitutional Convention for the purpose\r\nof amending our Constitution in order to \"expedite and insure\"\r\nparticipation of the United States in a world government. When the\r\nAmerican people found out what was going on, all of these \"resolutions\"\r\nwere repealed--most of them before the end of 1950.\r\n\r\nBut 1949 was a great year for American world government advocates.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn April 4, 1949, Dean Acheson's \"brainchild,\" the North Atlantic\r\nTreaty, was ratified by the United States. President Truman signed the\r\nproclamation putting NATO in force on August 24, 1949. Most Americans\r\nwere happy with this organization. It was supposedly a military alliance\r\nto protect the free world against communism. But few Americans bothered\r\nto read the brief, 14-article treaty. If they had, Article 2 would have\r\nsounded rather strange and out of place in a military alliance. Here is\r\nArticle 2 of the NATO Treaty:\r\n\r\n     \"The parties will contribute toward the future development of\r\n     peaceful and friendly international relations by strengthening\r\n     their free institutions, by bringing about a better understanding\r\n     of the principles upon which these institutions are founded, and by\r\n     promoting conditions of stability and _well being_. They will seek\r\n     to eliminate conflict in their international economic policies and\r\n     will encourage economic collaboration between any or all of them.\"\r\n\r\nHere in this \"military\" treaty, which re-affirms the participants'\r\n\"faith in the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United\r\nNations,\" is the legal basis for a union, an Atlantic Union, a\r\n_supra_-national government, all under the United Nations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nImmediately upon the formation of NATO, Clarence K. Streit created (in\r\n1949) the Atlantic Union Committee, Inc. Strait's old Federal Union was\r\npermitted to become virtually defunct (although it technically still\r\nexists, as publisher of Streit's books, and so on). Streit got federal\r\ntax exemption for the Atlantic Union Committee by writing into its\r\ncharter a proviso that the organisation would not \"attempt to influence\r\nlegislation by propaganda or otherwise.\"\r\n\r\nYet, the charter of AUC states its purposes as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"To promote support for congressional action requesting the\r\n     President of the United States to invite the other democracies\r\n     which sponsored the North Atlantic Treaty to name delegates,\r\n     representing their principal political parties, to meet with\r\n     delegates of the United States in a federal convention to explore\r\n     how far their peoples, and the peoples of such other democracies as\r\n     the convention may invite to send delegates, can apply among them,\r\n     within the framework of the United Nations, the principles of free\r\n     federal union.\"\r\n\r\nAn Atlantic Union Committee Resolution, providing for the calling of an\r\ninternational convention to \"explore\" steps toward a limited world\r\ngovernment, was actually introduced in the Congress in 1949--with the\r\nsupport of a frightful number of \"liberals\" then in the Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Resolution did not come to a vote in the 81st Congress (1949-1950).\r\nEstes Kefauver (Democrat, Tennessee) gravitated to the leadership in\r\npushing for the Resolution in subsequent Congresses; and he had the\r\nsupport of the top leadership of both parties, Republican and Democrat,\r\nnorth and south--including people like Richard Nixon, William Fulbright,\r\nLister Hill, Hubert Humphrey, Mike Mansfield, Kenneth Keating, Jacob\r\nJavits, Christian Herter, and so on.\r\n\r\nFrom 1949 to 1959, the Atlantic Union Resolution was introduced in each\r\nCongress--except the one Republican-controlled Congress (83rd--1953).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1959, Atlantic Union advocates, having got nowhere in ten years of\r\ntrying to push their Resolution through Congress, changed tactics. In\r\n1959, Streit's Atlantic Union Committee published a pamphlet entitled,\r\n_Our One Best Hope--For Us--For The United Nations--For All Mankind_,\r\nrecommending an \"action\" program to \"strengthen the UN.\" This \"action\"\r\nprogram asks the U.S. Congress to pass a Resolution calling for an\r\ninternational convention which would accomplish certain \"fundamental\r\nobjectives,\" to wit:\r\n\r\n     \"That only reasonably experienced democracies be asked to\r\n     participate; and that the number asked to participate should be\r\n     small enough to enhance the chance for early agreement, yet large\r\n     enough to create, if united, a preponderance of power on the side\r\n     of freedom.\r\n\r\n     \"That the delegates be officially appointed but that they be\r\n     uninstructed by their governments so that they shall be free to act\r\n     in accordance with their own individual consciences.\r\n\r\n     \"That, whatever the phraseology, it should not be such as to\r\n     preclude any proposal which, in the wisdom of the convention, is\r\n     the most practical step.\r\n\r\n     \"That the findings of the delegates could be only recommendations,\r\n     later to be accepted or rejected by their legislatures and their\r\n     fellow citizens.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe NATO Citizens Commission Law of 1960 fully carries out the purposes\r\nand intent of the new Atlantic Union strategy fabricated in 1959 to\r\nreplace the old Resolution which had failed for ten years.\r\n\r\nThe roll-call vote on this law (published in the February 27, 1961,\r\nissue of _The Dan Smoot Report_) shows what a powerful array of United\r\nStates Congressmen and Senators are for this step toward world\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe debates in House and Senate (Senate: _Congressional Record_, June\r\n15, 1960, pp. 11724 _ff_; House: _Congressional Record_, August 24,\r\n1960, pp. 16261 _ff_) show something even more significant.\r\n\r\nWhile denying that the NATO Citizens Commission Law had any relation to\r\nthe old Atlantic Union Resolution which Congress had refused for ten\r\nyears to consider, \"liberals\" in both Senate and House used language\r\nright out of the Atlantic Union Committee pamphlet of 1959 (_Our Best\r\nHope ..._) to \"prove\" that this NATO Citizens Commission proposal was\r\nnot dangerous: They argued, for example, that Commission members would\r\nbe free to act in accordance with their own individual consciences; that\r\nthe meetings of the Commission would be purely exploratory, and that\r\nCommission findings would be \"only recommendations,\" not binding on the\r\nU.S. government.\r\n\r\nCongressional \"liberals\" supporting the NATO Citizens Commission also\r\ntried to establish the respectability of the Commission by arguing that\r\nit was merely being created to explore means of implementing Article 2\r\nof the NATO Treaty. Are these \"liberal\" congressmen and senators so\r\nignorant that they do not know the whole Atlantic Union movement is\r\nbuilt under the canopy of \"implementing Article 2 of this NATO Treaty?\"\r\nOr, are they too stupid to understand this? Or, are they so dishonest\r\nthat they distort the facts, thinking that the public is too confused or\r\nignorant to discover the truth?\r\n\r\nAlthough the liberals in Congress loudly denied that the NATO Citizens\r\nCommission Law of 1960 had anything to do with Atlantic Union, Clarence\r\nStreit knew better--or was more honest. As soon as the law was passed,\r\nStreit began a hasty revision of his old _Union Now_. Early in 1961,\r\nHarper & Brothers published the revision, under the title _Freedom's\r\nFrontier Atlantic Union Now_.\r\n\r\nIn this new book, Streit expresses jubilation about the NATO Citizens\r\nCommission Law; and, on the second page of the first chapter, he says:\r\n\r\n     \"One change in the picture, which has seemed too slight or too\r\n     recent to be noted yet by the general public, seems to me so\r\n     significant as to give in itself reason enough for new faith in\r\n     freedom's future, and for this new effort to advance it. On\r\n     September 7, 1960, President Eisenhower signed an act of Congress\r\n     authorizing a United States Citizens Commission on NATO to\r\n     organize and participate in a Convention of Citizens of North\r\n     Atlantic Democracies with a view to exploring fully and\r\n     recommending concretely how to unite their peoples better.\"\r\n\r\n_The Atlantic Union News_ (published by the Atlantic Union Committee,\r\nInc.) in the September, 1960, issue presents an exultant article under\r\nthe headline \"AUC Victorious: Resolution Signed by President Becomes\r\nPublic Law 86-719.\"\r\n\r\nThe article says:\r\n\r\n     \"Members of the Atlantic Union Committee could certainly be\r\n     forgiven if by now they had decided that the Resolution for an\r\n     Atlantic Exploratory Convention would never pass both Houses of\r\n     Congress. However, it has just done so. It was signed into law by\r\n     the President September 7, 1960. The incredible size of this\r\n     victory is hard, even for us in Washington, to comprehend....\"\r\n\r\nWho actually runs Clarence Streit's Atlantic Union Committee which\r\nfinally succeeded in ordering the Congress and the President of the\r\nUnited States to take this sinister step toward world government? The\r\nCouncil on Foreign Relations! The three top officials of the Atlantic\r\nUnion Committee are members of the CFR: Elmo Roper, President; William\r\nL. Clayton, Vice President; and Lithgow Osborne, Secretary.\r\n\r\nAs of December, 1960, there were 871 members of the Atlantic Union\r\nCommittee. Of these, 107 were also members of the Council on Foreign\r\nRelations. The December, 1960, membership list of the AUC is in Appendix\r\nII of this volume. Each Council on Foreign Relations member is\r\ndesignated on that list with CFR in parentheses after his name.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe NATO Citizens Commission Law of 1960 provided that the Speaker of\r\nthe House and the Vice President should select 20 persons to serve on\r\nthe Commission. In March, 1961, Sam Rayburn and Lyndon Johnson appointed\r\nthe following persons as members of the Commission:\r\n\r\n     Donald G. Agger; Will L. Clayton; Charles William Engelhard, Jr.;\r\n     George J. Feldman; Morris Forgash; Christian A. Herter; Dr. Francis\r\n     S. Hutchins; Eric Johnston; William F. Knowland; Hugh Moore; Ralph\r\n     D. Pittman, Ben Regan; David Rockefeller; Elmo B. Roper (Jr.); Mrs.\r\n     Edith S. Sampson; Adolph W. Schmidt; Oliver C. Schroeder; Burr S.\r\n     Swezey, Sr.; Alex Warden; and Douglas Wynn.\r\n\r\nOf the 20 members of the NATO Citizens Commission, 7 are members of the\r\nCouncil on Foreign Relations: Clayton, Herter, Johnston, Moore,\r\nRockefeller, Roper, Schmidt. Roper is President and Clayton is Vice\r\nPresident of the Atlantic Union Committee. The others are generally\r\nsecond-level affiliates of the CFR.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe United World Federalists does not have as much power and influence\r\nas Clarence Streit's Atlantic Union, but is clearly the second most\r\ninfluential organization working for world government.\r\n\r\nThe specific objective of the United World Federalists is rapid\r\ntransformation (through expansion of the jurisdiction of the World\r\nCourt, establishment of an international \"police force,\" and so on) of\r\nthe United Nations into an all-powerful world government.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the UWF organization, as expressed in its own literature (the\r\nmost revealing piece of which is a pamphlet called _Beliefs, Purposes\r\nand Policies_) is:\r\n\r\n     \"To create a world federal government with authority to enact,\r\n     interpret, and enforce world law adequate to maintain peace.\"\r\n\r\nThe world federal government would be,\r\n\r\n     \"based upon the following principles and include the following\r\n     powers....\r\n\r\n     \"Membership open to all nations without the right of secession....\r\n     World law should be enforceable directly upon individuals.... The\r\n     world government should have direct taxing power independent of\r\n     national taxation.\"\r\n\r\nThe UWF scheme provides for a world police force and the prohibition of\r\n\"possession by any nation of armaments and forces beyond an approved\r\nlevel required for internal policing.\"\r\n\r\nThe UWF proposes to work toward its world government scheme,\r\n\r\n     \"By making use of the amendment process of the United Nations to\r\n     transform it into such a world federal government;\r\n\r\n     \"By participating in world constituent assemblies, whether of\r\n     private individuals, parliamentary or other groups seeking to\r\n     produce draft constitutions for consideration and possible adoption\r\n     by the United Nations or by national governments....\"\r\n\r\nNorman Cousins and James P. Warburg (both prominent Council on Foreign\r\nRelations members) formed the United World Federalists in February,\r\n1947, at Ashville, North Carolina, by amalgamating three small\r\norganizations (World Federalists, Student Federalists, and Americans\r\nUnited For World Government).\r\n\r\nCousins is still honorary president of UWF. Walter Reuther (a\r\n\"second-level\" affiliate of the CFR), Cousins, and Warburg actually run\r\nthe UWF at the top. Other Council on Foreign Relations members who are\r\nofficials in the UWF include Harry A. Bullis, Arthur H. Bunker, Cass\r\nCanfield, Mark F. Ethridge, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Harold K.\r\nGuinzburg, Isador Lubin, Cord Meyer, Jr., Lewis Mumford, Harry Scherman,\r\nRaymond Gram Swing, Paul C. Smith, Walter Wanger, James D. Zellerbach.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Institute for International Order, 11 West 42nd Street, New York 36,\r\nNew York, is another organization working for world government. It was\r\nfounded on November 17, 1948, at Washington, D.C., as the Association\r\nfor Education in World Government. On May 17, 1952, it changed its name\r\nto Institute for International Government. On May 7, 1954, it changed\r\nnames again, to the present Institute for International Order.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this organization has remained constant, through all the\r\nname changing, since it was originally founded in 1948: to strengthen\r\nthe United Nations into a genuine world government. And it is a part of\r\nthe interlocking apparatus which constitutes our invisible government.\r\n\r\nThe Institute for International Order gets 75% of its income from\r\nfoundations which members of the Council on Foreign Relations control;\r\nand the following CFR members are officers of the Institute: Earl D.\r\nOsborn (President), Henry B. Cabot (Vice President), Edward W. Barrett,\r\nPaul G. Hoffman, and Irving Salomon.\r\n\r\nIn 1948, the State Department created the U.S. Committee for the UN\r\n(mentioned in Chapter VIII, in connection with the Advertising Council)\r\nas a semi-official organization to propagandize for the UN in the United\r\nStates, with emphasis on promoting \"UN Day\" each year.\r\n\r\nThe Council on Foreign Relations dominates the U.S. Committee for the\r\nUN. Such persons as Stanley C. Allyn, Ralph Bunche, Gardner Cowles, H.\r\nJ. Heinz, II, Eric Johnston, Milton Katz, Stanley Marcus, Hugh Moore,\r\nJohn Nason, Earl D. Osborn, Jack I. Straus, and Walter Wheeler, Jr.--all\r\nCouncil on Foreign Relations members--are members of the U.S. Committee\r\nfor the United Nations.\r\n\r\nWalter Wheeler, Jr., (last name in the list above) is President of\r\nPitney-Bowes, maker of postage meter machines. In 1961, Mr. Wheeler\r\ntried to stop all Pitney-Bowes customers from using, on their meter\r\nmachines, the American patriotic slogan, \"This is a republic, not a\r\ndemocracy: let's keep it that way.\" Mr. Wheeler said this slogan was\r\ncontroversial. But Mr. Wheeler supported a campaign to get the slogan of\r\ninternational socialism, _UN We Believe_, used on Pitney-Bowes postage\r\nmeter machines--probably the most controversial slogan ever to appear in\r\nAmerican advertising, as we shall see presently.\r\n\r\nThe American Association for the United Nations--AAUN--is another\r\ntax-exempt, \"semi-private\" organization set up (not directly by the CFR,\r\nbut by the State Department which the Council runs) as a propaganda\r\nagency for the UN. It serves as an outlet for UN pamphlets and, with\r\nchapters in most key cities throughout the United States, as an\r\norganizer of meetings, lecture-series, and other programs which\r\npropagandize about the ineffable goodness and greatness of the United\r\nNations as the maker and keeper of world peace.\r\n\r\nThe Council on Foreign Relations dominates the AAUN. Some of the leading\r\nCFR members who run the AAUN are: Ralph J. Bunche, Cass Canfield,\r\nBenjamin V. Cohen, John Cowles, Clark M. Eichelberger, Ernest A. Gross,\r\nPaul G. Hoffman, Palmer Hoyt, Herbert Lehman, Oscar de Lima, Irving\r\nSalomon, James T. Shotwell, Sumner Welles, Quincy Wright.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1958, the United States Committee for the UN created an Industry\r\nParticipation Division for the specific purpose of getting the UN emblem\r\nand _UN We Believe_ slogan displayed on the commercial vehicles,\r\nstationery, business forms, office buildings, flag poles, and\r\nadvertising layouts of American business firms. The first major firm to\r\nplunge conspicuously into this pro-UN propaganda drive was United Air\r\nLines.\r\n\r\nW. A. Patterson, President of United, is an official of the Committee\r\nFor Economic Development, a major Council on Foreign Relations\r\npropaganda affiliate, and has served on the Business-Education Committee\r\nof the CED. Mr. Patterson had the _UN We Believe_ emblem painted in a\r\nconspicuous place on every plane in the United Air Lines fleet. There\r\nwas a massive protest from Americans who know that the UN is part of the\r\ngreat scheme to destroy America as a free and independent republic. Mr.\r\nPatterson had the UN emblems removed from his planes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1961, the American Association for the United Nations and the U. S.\r\nCommittee for the UN (both enjoying federal tax exemption, as\r\n\"educational\" in the \"public interest\") created another tax-exempt\r\norganization to plaster the UN emblem all over the American landscape.\r\n\r\nThe new organization is called UN We Believe. Here is an article from\r\nthe May-June, 1961, issue of _Weldwood News_, a house organ of United\r\nStates Plywood Corporation (New York 36, New York):\r\n\r\n     \"A. W. (Al) Teichmeier, USP director of merchandising, is the\r\n     Company's closest physical link to the United Nations--he's\r\n     President of UN We Believe.\r\n\r\n     \"UN We Believe, under joint auspices of the American Association\r\n     for the UN and the U. S. Committee for the UN, is a non-profit,\r\n     year-round program geared to convince industry, organizations and\r\n     individuals how important public support can mean in preserving\r\n     world peace.\r\n\r\n     \"USP uses the seal ... (UN emblem and _UN We Believe_ slogan) on\r\n     its postage meters for all New York mailings. Among some other\r\n     active companies in the program are CIT, General Telephone, Texaco,\r\n     American Sugar Refining, P. Lorillard Co., and KLM Dutch Airlines.\"\r\n\r\nPlywood companies (small ones, producing hardwood plywood, if not big\r\nones like USP) have been grievously hurt by the trade and foreign-aid\r\npolicies which the UN, international-socialist crowd is responsible for.\r\n\r\nLenin is said to have remarked that when it comes time for communists to\r\nhang all capitalists, the capitalists will bid against each other for\r\ncontracts to sell the rope.\r\n\r\nThe article from _Weldwood News_, quoted above, was quoted in the July\r\n17, 1961, issue of _The Dan Smoot Report_. The companies mentioned\r\nreceived some mail, criticizing them for supporting UN We Believe. The\r\nTexaco Company denied that it had ever been active in UN We Believe and\r\nsaid that the editor of _Weldwood News_ had apologized for the error in\r\npublishing the reference to Texaco and had expressed regret for \"the\r\nembarrassment caused\" Texaco.\r\n\r\nWhile denying support for UN We Believe, however, Mr. Augustus C. Long,\r\nChairman of the Board of Texaco (and a member of the Business Advisory\r\nCouncil) gave unqualified endorsement of the Council on Foreign\r\nRelations. In a letter dated August 17, 1961, Mr. Long said:\r\n\r\n     \"The Council on Foreign Relations is one of the most effective\r\n     organizations in this country devoted to spreading information on\r\n     international problems. The officers and directors of the Council\r\n     are men of reputation and stature. We believe that the Council\r\n     through its study groups makes an outstanding contribution to\r\n     public information concerning foreign policy issues.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 8\r\n\r\nFOREIGN AID\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day in the spring of 1961, a New York lawyer received a long\r\ndistance telephone call. Concerning this call, the _New York Times_\r\nreported:\r\n\r\n     \"'This is President Kennedy,' the telephone voice said.\r\n\r\n     \"'The hell you say,' retorted the lawyer. 'I guess that makes me\r\n     the Prime Minister of England, but what can I do for you?'\r\n\r\n     \"'Nobody's pulling your leg,' the telephone voice said. 'This is\r\n     President Kennedy all right. I want to talk to you about coming\r\n     down here to Washington to help me with this long-term foreign aid\r\n     legislation.'\"\r\n\r\nOne week later, the New York lawyer took an apartment in Washington and,\r\nas a member of President Kennedy's \"Task Force\" on foreign aid, started\r\nwriting the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The lawyer is Theodore\r\nTannenwald, Jr., a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, who wrote\r\nmany of the foreign aid bills which President Harry Truman presented to\r\nCongress and who, during the first Eisenhower term, was assistant\r\ndirector of the Mutual Security Program.\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Tannenwald and his task force had finished writing the 1961\r\nforeign aid bill, President Kennedy appointed Tannenwald coordinator in\r\ncharge of \"presenting\" the bill to committees of the House and Senate.\r\nThree cabinet officers and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff\r\ntook their orders from Mr. Tannenwald, who was, according to the _New\r\nYork Times_, \"the Administration's composer, orchestrator and conductor\r\nof the most important legislative symphony of the Congressional\r\nsession.\"\r\n\r\nWith admiration, the _Times_ said:\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Tannenwald has been a kind of special White House ambassador\r\n     to Capitol Hill. While the legislative committees struggled with\r\n     the controversial proposal to by-pass the appropriating process and\r\n     give the President authority to borrow $8,800,000,000 (8 billion,\r\n     800 million) for development lending in the next five years, he was\r\n     the man in the ante-room empowered to answer questions in the name\r\n     of the President.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn July, 1961, President Kennedy completed Mr. Tannenwald's foreign aid\r\n\"orchestra.\" On July 10, in ceremonies at the White House, the President\r\nformally announced creation of the newest foreign-aid propaganda\r\norganization, the Citizens Committee for International Development, with\r\nWarren Lee Pierson as chairman. Here is the membership of the Citizens\r\nCommittee for International Development:\r\n\r\n     _Eugenie Anderson_ (member of the Atlantic Union Committee);\r\n     _William Benton_ (Chairman of the Board of _Encyclopaedia\r\n     Britannica_; member of the Atlantic Union Committee); _Everett N.\r\n     Case_ (President of Colgate University); _O. Roy Chalk_ (President\r\n     of the District of Columbia Transit Company); _Malcolm S. Forbes_\r\n     (Editor and Publisher of _Forbes Magazine_); _Eleanor Clark\r\n     French_; _Albert M. Greenfield_ (Honorary Chairman of the Board of\r\n     Bankers Security Corporation, Philadelphia); _General Alfred M.\r\n     Gruenther_ (President of the American National Red Cross; member of\r\n     the Atlantic Union Committee); _Murray D. Lincoln_ (Chairman of\r\n     Nationwide Insurance Company); _Sol M. Linowitz_ (Chairman of Zerox\r\n     Corporation); _George Meany_ (President of AFL-CIO); _William S.\r\n     Paley_ (Chairman of the Board, Columbia Broadcasting System);\r\n     _Warren Lee Pierson_ (Chairman of the Board, Trans-World Airways);\r\n     _Ross Pritchard_ (Professor of Political Science, Southwestern\r\n     University, Memphis); _Thomas S. Nichols_ (Chairman of the Board\r\n     of Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation; member of the Atlantic\r\n     Union Committee); _Mrs. Mary G. Roebling_ (President Of Trenton\r\n     Trust Company); _David Sarnoff_ (Chairman of Radio Corporation of\r\n     America); _Walter Sterling Surrey_ (legal consultant, Economic\r\n     Cooperation Administration); _Thomas J. Watson, Jr._, (President of\r\n     International Business Machines Corporation); _Walter H. Wheeler,\r\n     Jr._, (President of Pitney-Bowes); _James D. Zellerbach_ (President\r\n     and Director of Crown-Zellerbach Corporation; Chairman of\r\n     Fibreboard Products, Inc.; member of the Atlantic Union Committee\r\n     and United World Federalists); _Ezra Zilkha_ (head of Zilkha &\r\n     Sons).\r\n\r\nOf these 22 people, 12 (including the Chairman) are members of the\r\nCouncil on Foreign Relations: Benton, Case, Gruenther, Paley, Pierson,\r\nPritchard, Nichols, Sarnoff, Surrey, Watson, Wheeler, and Zellerbach.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHeads of the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations attended the White House\r\nluncheon when the Committee was formed. Vice President Johnson,\r\nSecretary of State Dean Rusk, and Attorney General Robert Kennedy were\r\nalso present. The President urged each and all to get foundations,\r\nbusiness firms, civic organizations, and the people generally, to put\r\npressure on Congress in support of the 1961 foreign aid bill.\r\n\r\nWithin a week after the July 10, White House luncheon meeting (which\r\nlaunched the CFR's foreign aid committee), the President and his\r\nhigh-level aides were talking about a grave crisis in Berlin and about\r\nforeign aid as _the_ essential means of \"meeting\" that crisis.\r\n\r\nOn July 25, when congressional debates over the foreign aid bill were in\r\na critical stage, President Kennedy spoke to the nation on radio and\r\ntelevision, solemnly warning the people that the Berlin situation was\r\ndangerous.\r\n\r\nImmediate, additional support for the foreign aid bill came from the\r\ncountry's liberal and leftwing forces, who united in a passionate\r\nplea--urging the American people to support the President \"in this grave\r\nhour.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn August 27, an Associated Press release announced that House Leader\r\nJohn W. McCormack (Democrat, Massachusetts), was attempting to enlist\r\nthe cooperation of 2,400 city mayors in support of a long-range foreign\r\naid bill to meet the President's demands.\r\n\r\nMcCormack sent the city officials a statement of his views with a cover\r\nletter suggesting that the matter be brought to \"the attention of\r\ncitizens of your community through publication in your local newspaper,\"\r\nand, further, urging their \"personal endorsement of this bipartisan\r\nprogram through the medium of your local press....\"\r\n\r\nState Department officials scheduled speaking tours throughout the land,\r\nand CFR affiliated organizations (like the Councils on World Affairs)\r\nstarted the build-up to provide audiences--all in the interest of\r\n\"briefing\" the American people on the necessity and beauties of foreign\r\naid.\r\n\r\nAnyone with sense had to wonder how the giving of American tax money to\r\ncommunist governments in Europe and to socialist governments all over\r\nthe earth could help us resist communism in Berlin. But with the top\r\nleaders in our society (from the President downward to officials in the\r\nNational Council of Churches) telling us that the survival of our nation\r\ndepended on the President's getting all the foreign aid \"authorization\"\r\nhe wanted--most Americans remained silent, feeling that such\r\nconsequential and complicated matters should be left in the hands of our\r\nchosen leaders.\r\n\r\nBy the end of August, the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 had been passed\r\nby both houses of Congress; and the Berlin crisis moved from front page\r\nlead articles in the nation's newspapers to less important columns.\r\n\r\nThus, in 1961, as always, the foreign aid bill was a special project of\r\nour invisible government, the Council on Foreign Relations. And, in\r\n1961, as always, the great, tax-supported propaganda machine used a fear\r\npsychology to bludgeon the people into silence and the Congress into\r\nobedience.\r\n\r\nPresident Kennedy signed the Act as Public Law 87-195 on September 4,\r\n1961.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPublic Law 87-195 authorized $10,253,500,000 (10 billion, 253 million,\r\n500 thousand) in foreign aid: $3,066,500,000 appropriated for the 1962\r\nfiscal year, and $7,187,000,000 Treasury borrowing authorized for the\r\nnext five years. The law does require the President to obtain annual\r\nappropriations for the Treasury borrowing, but permits him to make\r\ncommitments to lend the money to foreign countries, _before_ he obtains\r\nappropriations from Congress.\r\n\r\nIt was widely reported in the press that Congress had denied the\r\nPresident the long-term borrowing authority he had requested; but the\r\nPresident himself was satisfied. He knew that by promising loans to\r\nforeign governments (that is, \"committing\" the funds in advance of\r\ncongressional appropriation) he would thus force Congress (in the\r\ninterest of showing \"national unity\" and of not \"repudiating\" our\r\nPresident) to appropriate whatever he promised.\r\n\r\nOn August 29, the President said:\r\n\r\n     \"The compromise ... is wholly satisfactory. It gives the United\r\n     States Government authority to make commitments for long-term\r\n     development programs with reasonable assurance that these\r\n     commitments will be met.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFormer Vice President Richard M. Nixon (a member of the CFR) was happy\r\nabout the 1961 foreign aid bill. On August 29, Nixon, on the ABC radio\r\nnetwork, said that he favored such \"long-range foreign aid planning,\r\nfinanced through multi-year authorizations and annual appropriations.\"\r\n\r\nNelson A. Rockefeller, Republican Governor of New York, announced that\r\nhe too favored \"long-range foreign aid planning, financed through\r\nmulti-year authorizations and annual appropriations\"--exactly like\r\nNixon.\r\n\r\nFormer President Eisenhower was also happy. He, too, said he favored\r\nthis sort of thing.\r\n\r\nSenator J. William Fulbright (Democrat, Arkansas) was almost jubilant:\r\nhe said Congress for the next five years would be under \"strong\r\nobligation\" to put up the money for whatever the President promises to\r\nforeign governments.\r\n\r\nAll in all, it is improbable that Congress ever passed another bill more\r\ndestructive of American constitutional principles; more harmful to our\r\nnation politically, economically, morally, and militarily; and more\r\nhelpful to communism-socialism all over the earth--than the Foreign\r\nAssistance Act of 1961, which was, from beginning to end, a product of\r\nthe Council on Foreign Relations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur foreign aid does grievous harm to the American people by burdening\r\nthem with excessive taxation, thus making it difficult for them to\r\nexpand their own economy. This gives government pretext for intervening\r\nwith more taxation and controls for domestic subsidies.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the money that government takes away from us for foreign\r\naid is used to subsidize our political enemies and economic competitors\r\nabroad. Note, for example, the large quantities of agricultural goods\r\nwhich we give every year to communist satellite nations, thus enabling\r\ncommunist governments to control the hungry people of those nations.\r\nNote that while we are giving away our agricultural surpluses to\r\ncommunist and socialist nations, we, under the 1961 foreign aid bill (as\r\nunder previous ones), are subsidizing agricultural production in the\r\nunderdeveloped countries.\r\n\r\nThe 1961 foreign aid bill prohibited direct aid to Cuba, but authorized\r\ncontributions to United Nations agencies, which were giving aid to Cuba.\r\n\r\nAt a time when the American economy was suffering from the flight of\r\nAmerican industry to foreign lands, the 1961 foreign aid bill offered\r\nsubsidies and investment guarantees to American firms moving abroad.\r\n\r\nOur foreign aid enriches and strengthens political leaders and ruling\r\noligarchies (which are often corrupt) in underdeveloped lands; and it\r\ndoes infinite harm to the people of those lands, when it inflates their\r\neconomy and foists upon them an artificially-produced industrialism\r\nwhich they are not prepared to sustain or even understand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe basic argument for foreign aid is that by helping the underdeveloped\r\nnations develop, we will keep them from falling under the dictatorship\r\nof communism. The argument is false and unsound, historically,\r\npolitically, economically, and morally.\r\n\r\nThe communists have never subjugated a nation by winning the loyalties\r\nof the oppressed and downtrodden. The communists first win the support\r\nof liberal-intellectuals, and then use them to subvert and pervert all\r\nestablished mores and ideals and social and political arrangements.\r\n\r\nOur foreign aid does not finance freedom in foreign lands; it finances\r\nsocialism; and a world socialist system is what communists are trying to\r\nestablish. As early as 1921, Joseph Stalin said that the advanced\r\nwestern nations must give economic aid to other nations in order to\r\nsocialize their economies and prepare them for integration in the\r\ncommunist's world socialist system.\r\n\r\nSocializing the economies of all nations so that all can be merged into\r\na one-world system was the objective of Colonel Edward M. House, who\r\nfounded the Council on Foreign Relations, and has been the objective of\r\nthe Council, and of all its associated organizations, from the\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 9\r\n\r\nMORE OF THE INTERLOCK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is impossible in this volume to discuss all organizations interlocked\r\nwith the Council on Foreign Relations. In previous chapters, I have\r\ndiscussed some of the most powerful agencies in the interlock. In this\r\nchapter, I present brief discussions of a few organizations which make\r\nsignificant contributions to the over-all program of the Council.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTITUTE FOR AMERICAN STRATEGY\r\n\r\nThere are some men in the Council on Foreign Relations who condemn the\r\n_consequences_ of the CFR's policies--but who never mention the CFR as\r\nresponsible for those policies, and who never really suggest any change\r\nin the policies.\r\n\r\nFrank R. Barnett is such a man. Mr. Barnett, a member of the Council on\r\nForeign Relations, is research director for the Richardson Foundation\r\nand also program director for the Institute for American Strategy, which\r\nis largely financed by the Richardson Foundation. The Institute for\r\nAmerican Strategy holds two-day regional \"Strategy Seminars\" in cities\r\nthroughout the United States. Participants in the seminars are carefully\r\nselected civic and community leaders. The announced official purpose of\r\nthe seminars is:\r\n\r\n     \"...to inform influential private American citizens of the danger\r\n     which confronts the United States in the realm of world politics.\r\n     They have been conceived as a means for arousing an informed and\r\n     articulate patriotism which can provide the basis for the\r\n     sustained and intensive effort which alone can counter the skillful\r\n     propaganda and ruthless conquest so successfully practiced by the\r\n     Soviet Union and her allies and satellites.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Barnett is generally one of the featured speakers at these seminars.\r\nHe speaks effectively, arousing his audience to an awareness of the\r\nSoviets as an ugly menace to freedom and decency in the world. He makes\r\nhis audience squirm with anxiety about how America is losing the cold\r\nwar on all fronts, and makes them burn with desire to reverse this\r\ntrend. But when it comes to suggesting what can be done about the\r\nterrible situation, Mr. Barnett seems only to recommend that more and\r\nmore people listen to more and more speakers like him in order to become\r\nangrier at the Soviets and more disturbed about American losses--so that\r\nwe can continue the same policies we have, but do a better job with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nMr. Barnett never criticizes the basic internationalist policy of\r\nentwining the affairs of America with those of other nations, because\r\nMr. Barnett, like all other internationalists, takes it for granted that\r\nAmerica can no longer defend herself, without \"allies,\" whom we must buy\r\nwith foreign aid. He does imply that our present network of permanent,\r\nentangling alliances is not working well; but he never hints that we\r\nshould abandon this disastrous policy and return to the traditional\r\nAmerican policy of benign neutrality and no-permanent-involvement, which\r\noffers the only possible hope for our peace and security. Rather, Mr.\r\nBarnett would just like us to conduct our internationalist policy in\r\nsuch a way as to avoid the disaster which our internationalist policy is\r\nbuilding for us.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Barnett's recommendations on how to fight communism on the domestic\r\nfront also trail off, generally, into contradictions and confusion. For\r\nexample, in his speech to the \"Strategy Seminar\" arranged by the\r\nInstitute for American Strategy and sponsored by the Fulton County\r\nMedical Society in Atlanta, Georgia, June, 1961, Mr. Barnett urged all\r\ncitizens to inform themselves about the communist threat and become\r\neducated on its aims so that they will be capable of combatting\r\ncommunist propaganda. But, Mr. Barnett said, citizens are \"silly\" who\r\nconcern themselves with trying to find communists and fellow-travelers\r\nin the PTA!\r\n\r\nIn a speech to reserve officers at the War College in July, 1961, Mr.\r\nBarnett denounced \"crackpots\" who hunt \"pinkos\" in local colleges. He\r\nsaid the theory that internal subversion is the chief danger to the\r\nUnited States is fallacious--and is harmful, because it has great\r\npopular appeal. Belief in this theory, Mr. Barnett said, makes people\r\nmistakenly feel that they \"don't have to think about ... strengthening\r\nNATO, or improving foreign aid management, or volunteering for the Peace\r\nCorps, or anything else that might require sacrifice.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Barnett, who speaks persuasively as an expert on fighting communism,\r\napparently does not know that the real work of the communist conspiracy\r\nis not performed by the shabby people who staff the official apparatus\r\nof the communist party, but is done by well-intentioned people (in the\r\nPTA and similar organizations) who have been brainwashed with communist\r\nideas. Communists (whom Mr. Barnett hates and fears) did not do the\r\ntremendous job of causing the United States to abandon her traditional\r\npolicies of freedom and independence for the internationalist policies\r\nwhich are dragging us into one-world socialism. The most distinguished\r\nand respected Americans of our time, in the Council on Foreign Relations\r\n(of which Mr. Barnett is a member) did this job.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that the principal book offered for sale and\r\nrecommended for reading at Mr. Barnett's, \"Strategy Seminars\" is\r\n_American Strategy For The Nuclear Age_. The first chapter in the book,\r\nentitled \"Basic Aims of United States Foreign Policy,\" is a reprint of a\r\nCouncil on Foreign Relations report, compiled by a CFR meeting in 1959,\r\nattended by such well-known internationalist \"liberals\" as Frank\r\nAltschul, Hamilton Fish Armstrong, Adolf A. Berle, Jr., Robert Blum,\r\nRobert R. Bowie, John Cowles, Arthur H. Dean, Thomas K. Finletter,\r\nWilliam C. Foster, W. Averell Harriman, Philip C. Jessup, Joseph E.\r\nJohnson, Henry R. Luce, I. I. Rabi, Herman B. Wells, Henry M. Wriston.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMISSION ON NATIONAL GOALS\r\n\r\nOn December 6, 1960, President Eisenhower presented, to President-elect\r\nKennedy, a report by the President's Commission on National Goals, a\r\ngroup of \"distinguished\" Americans whom President Eisenhower had\r\nappointed 11 months before to find out what America's national purpose\r\nshould be.\r\n\r\nThe national purpose of this nation _should be_ exactly what it was\r\nduring the first 125 years of our national life: to stand as proof that\r\nfree men can govern themselves; to blaze a trail toward freedom, a trail\r\nwhich all people, if they wish, can follow or guide themselves by,\r\nwithout any meddling from us.\r\n\r\nHydrogen bombs and airplanes and intercontinental ballistic missiles do\r\nnot change basic principles. The principles on which our nation was\r\nfounded are eternal, as valid now as in the 18th century.\r\n\r\nIndeed, modern developments in science should make us cling to those\r\nprinciples. If foreign enemies can now destroy our nation by pressing a\r\nbutton, it seems obvious that our total defense effort should be devoted\r\nto protecting our nation against such an attack: it is suicidal for us\r\nto waste any of our defense effort on \"economic improvement\" and\r\nmilitary assistance for other nations.\r\n\r\nAll of this being obvious, it is also obvious that the President's\r\nCommission on National Goals was not really trying to discover our\r\n\"national purpose.\" \"National Purpose\" was the label for a propaganda\r\neffort intended to help perpetuate governmental policies, which are\r\ndragging America into international socialism, regardless of who\r\nsucceeded Eisenhower as President.\r\n\r\nThe Report is actually a rehash of major provisions in the 1960 Democrat\r\nand Republican party platforms. More than that, it is, in several\r\nfundamental and specific ways, identical with the 1960 published program\r\nof the communist party. (For a full discussion of the President's\r\nCommission on National Goals, see _The Dan Smoot Report_, \"Our National\r\nPurpose,\" December 12, 1960.)\r\n\r\nWho were the \"distinguished\" Americans whom Eisenhower appointed to draw\r\nthis blueprint of America's National Purpose? They were:\r\n\r\n     Erwin D. Canham, Editor-in-Chief of the _Christian Science\r\n     Monitor_; James B. Conant, former President of Harvard; Colgate W.\r\n     Darden, Jr., former President of the University of Virginia and\r\n     former Governor of Virginia; Crawford H. Greenewalt, President of\r\n     E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., Inc.; General Alfred M. Gruenther,\r\n     President of the American Red Cross; Learned Hand, retired judge of\r\n     the U.S. Court of Appeals; Clark Kerr, President of the University\r\n     of California; James R. Killian, Jr., Chairman of the Massachusetts\r\n     Institute of Technology; George Meany, President of the AFL-CIO;\r\n     Frank Pace, Jr., former member of Truman's cabinet; Henry M.\r\n     Wriston, President of American Assembly and President Emeritus of\r\n     Brown University.\r\n\r\nOf the 11, 7 are members of the Council on Foreign Relations--Canham,\r\nConant, Gruenther, Hand, Killian, Pace, Wriston. All of the others are\r\nlower-level affiliates of the CFR.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIONAL PLANNING ASSOCIATION\r\n\r\nThe National Planning Association was established in 1934 \"to bring\r\ntogether leaders from agriculture, business, labor, and the professions\r\nto pool their experience and foresight in developing workable plans for\r\nthe nation's future....\"\r\n\r\nThe quotation is from an NPA booklet, which also says:\r\n\r\n     \"Every year since the NPA was organized in 1934, its reports have\r\n     strongly influenced our national economy, U.S. economic policy, and\r\n     business decisions.\"\r\n\r\nHere are members of the Council on Foreign Relations listed as officials\r\nof the National Planning Association: Frank Altschul, Laird Bell,\r\nCourtney C. Brown, Eric Johnston, Donald R. Murphy, Elmo Roper,\r\nBeardsley Ruml, Hans Christian Sonne, Lauren Soth, Wayne Chatfield\r\nTaylor, John Hay Whitney.\r\n\r\nThe following officials of National Planning Association are generally\r\nsecond-level affiliates of the CFR--or are, at any rate, worth noting:\r\nArnold Zander, International President of American Federation of State,\r\nCounty and Municipal Employees; Solomon Barkin, Director of Research for\r\nthe Textile Workers Union of America; L. S. Buckmaster, General\r\nPresident, United Rubber, Cork, Linoleum & Plastic Workers of America;\r\nJames B. Carey, Secretary-Treasurer of CIO; Albert J. Hayes,\r\nInternational President of International Association of Machinists; and\r\nWalter P. Reuther.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION\r\n\r\nIn 1920, the American Civil Liberties Union was founded by Felix\r\nFrankfurter, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, William Z.\r\nFoster, then head of the U.S. Communist Party; Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, a\r\ntop communist party official; Dr. Harry F. Ward, of Union Theological\r\nSeminary, a notorious communist-fronter; and Roger Baldwin.\r\n\r\nPatrick M. Malin, a member of the CFR, has been director of the American\r\nCivil Liberties Union since 1952. Other CFR members who are known to be\r\nofficials in the American Civil Liberties Union are: William Butler,\r\nRichard S. Childs, Norman Cousins, Palmer Hoyt, Jr., J. Robert\r\nOppenheimer, Elmo Roper, Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF CHRISTIANS AND JEWS\r\n\r\nThe late Charles Evans Hughes (a member of the CFR) and the late S.\r\nParkes Cadman (former President of the Federal--now National--Council of\r\nChurches) founded the National Conference of Christians and Jews in\r\n1928.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1950 (at the suggestion of Paul Hoffman) the National\r\nConference of Christians and Jews founded World Brotherhood at UNESCO\r\nHouse in Paris, France. The officers of World Brotherhood were: Konrad\r\nAdenauer, William Benton, Arthur H. Compton, Paul Henri-Spaak, Paul G.\r\nHoffman, Herbert H. Lehman, John J. McCloy, George Meany, Madame Pandit,\r\nPaul Reynaud, Eleanor Roosevelt, Adlai Stevenson.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn August, 1958, World Brotherhood held a seminar in Bern, Switzerland.\r\nAll of the officers listed above attended and prepared \"working papers.\"\r\nHere is a summary of conclusions reached at this World Brotherhood\r\nmeeting, as condensed from an article by Arthur Krock, in _The New York\r\nTimes_, November 21, 1958:\r\n\r\n     _We must recognize that the communist countries are here to stay\r\n     and cannot be wished away by propaganda. All is not bad in\r\n     communist countries. Western nations could learn from communist\r\n     experiments. We should study ways to make changes in both\r\n     systems--communist and western--in order to bring them nearer\r\n     together. We should try to eliminate the stereo-type attitudes\r\n     about, and suspicion of, communism. We must assume that the\r\n     communist side is not worse than, but merely different from, our\r\n     side._\r\n\r\nIn May, 1960, World Brotherhood held a conference on \"World Tensions\" at\r\nChicago University. Lester B. Pearson (socialist-internationalist from\r\nCanada) presided at the conference; and the following members of the\r\nCouncil on Foreign Relations served as officials: William Benton, Ralph\r\nBunche, Marquis Childs, Harlan Cleveland, Norman Cousins, Ernest A.\r\nGross, Paul G. Hoffman, and Adlai Stevenson.\r\n\r\nThe National Conference of Christians and Jews-World Brotherhood 1960\r\nmeeting on \"World Tensions,\" at Chicago University, concluded that the\r\ncommunists are interested in more trade but not interested in political\r\nsubversion, and recommended:\r\n\r\n(1) a three-billion-dollar-a-year increase in U. S. foreign aid to\r\n\"poor\" countries; (2) repeal of the Connally Reservation; (3) closer\r\nrelations between the U. S. and communist countries.\r\n\r\nAdlai Stevenson told the group that Khrushchev is merely a \"tough and\r\nrealistic politician and polemicist,\" with whom it is possible to\r\n\"conduct the dialogue of reason.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1961, World Brotherhood, Inc., changed its name to Conference On\r\nWorld Tensions.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN ASSEMBLY\r\n\r\nIn 1950, when President of Columbia University, General Dwight D.\r\nEisenhower founded the American Assembly--sometimes calling itself the\r\nArden House Group, taking this name from its headquarters and meeting\r\nplace. The Assembly holds a series of meetings at Arden House in New\r\nYork City about every six months, and other round-table discussions at\r\nvarying intervals throughout the nation.\r\n\r\nThe 19th meeting of the Arden House Group, which ended May 7, 1961, was\r\ntypical of all others, in that it was planned and conducted by members\r\nof the Council on Foreign Relations--and concluded with recommendations\r\nconcerning American policy, which, if followed, would best serve the\r\nends of the Kremlin.\r\n\r\nThis 1961 Arden House meeting dealt with the problem of disarmament.\r\nHenry M. Wriston (President of American Assembly and Director of the\r\nCouncil on Foreign Relations) presided over the three major discussion\r\ngroups--each group, in turn, was under the chairmanship of a member of\r\nthe Council: Raymond J. Sontag of the University of California; Milton\r\nKatz, Director of International Legal Studies at Harvard; and Dr. Philip\r\nE. Mosely, Director of Studies for the Council on Foreign Relations.\r\n\r\nJohn J. McCloy (a member of the CFR) as President Kennedy's Director of\r\nDisarmament, sent three subordinates to participate. Two of the three\r\n(Edmund A. Gullion, Deputy Director of the Disarmament Administration;\r\nand Shepard Stone, a Ford Foundation official) are members of the CFR.\r\n\r\nHere are two major recommendations which the May, 1961, American\r\nAssembly meeting made:\r\n\r\n     (1) that the United States avoid weapons and measures which might\r\n     give \"undue provocation\" to the Soviets, and which might reduce the\r\n     likelihood of disarmament agreements;\r\n\r\n     (2) that the United States strengthen its conventional military\r\n     forces for participation in \"limited wars\" but avoid building up an\r\n     ordnance of nuclear weapons.\r\n\r\nWe cannot match the communist nations in manpower or \"conventional\r\nmilitary forces\" and should not try. Our only hope is to keep our\r\nmilitary manpower in reserve, and uncommitted, in the United States,\r\nwhile building an overwhelming superiority in nuclear weapons. When we\r\n\"strengthen our conventional forces for participation in limited wars,\"\r\nwe are leaving the Soviets with the initiative to say when and where\r\nthose wars will be fought; and we are committing ourselves to fight with\r\nthe kind of forces in which the Soviets will inevitably have\r\nsuperiority. More than that, we are consuming so much of our economic\r\nresources that we do not have enough left for weaponry of the kind that\r\nwould defend our homeland.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICANS FOR DEMOCRATIC ACTION\r\n\r\nThe ADA was founded in April, 1947, at a meeting in the old Willard\r\nHotel, Washington, D. C. Members of the Council on Foreign Relations\r\ndominated this meeting--and have dominated the ADA ever since.\r\n\r\nHere are members of the Council on Foreign Relations who are, or were,\r\ntop officials in Americans For Democratic Action: Francis Biddle,\r\nChester Bowles, Marquis Childs, Elmer Davis, William H. Davis, David\r\nDubinsky, Thomas K. Finletter, John Kenneth Galbraith, Palmer Hoyt,\r\nHubert H. Humphrey, Jacob K. Javits, Herbert H. Lehman, Reinhold\r\nNiebuhr, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.\r\n\r\nHere are some of the policies which the ADA openly and vigorously\r\nadvocated in 1961:\r\n\r\n     Abolition of the House Committee on Un-American Activities\r\n\r\n     Congressional investigation of the John Birch Society\r\n\r\n     Total Disarmament under United Nations control\r\n\r\n     U. S. recognition of red China\r\n\r\n     Admission of red China to the United Nations, in place of\r\n     nationalist China\r\n\r\n     Federal aid to all public schools\r\n\r\n     Drastic overhaul of our immigration laws, to permit a more\r\n     \"liberal\" admission of immigrants\r\n\r\n     Urban renewal and planning for all cities\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere is a good, brief characterization of the ADA, from a _Los Angeles\r\nTimes_ editorial, September 18, 1961:\r\n\r\n     \"The ADA members ... are as an organization strikingly like the\r\n     British Fabian Socialists.... The Fabians stood for non-Marxian\r\n     evolutionary socialism, to be achieved not by class war but by\r\n     ballot....\r\n\r\n     \"ADA is not an organization for subversive violence like\r\n     Marxist-Lenin communism.... The socialism they want to bring about\r\n     would be quite as total, industrially, as that in Russia, but they\r\n     would accomplish it by legislation, not by shooting, and, of\r\n     course, by infiltrating the executive branch of the government....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSANE NUCLEAR POLICY, INC.\r\n\r\nIn 1955, Bertrand Russell (British pro-communist socialist) and the late\r\nAlbert Einstein (notorious for the number of communist fronts he\r\nsupported) held a meeting in London (attended by communists and\r\nsocialists from all over the world). In a fanfare of publicity, Russell\r\nand Einstein demanded international co-operation among atomic\r\nscientists.\r\n\r\nTaking his inspiration from this meeting, Cyrus Eaton (wealthy American\r\nindustrialist, notorious for his consistent pro-communist sympathies),\r\nin 1956, held the first \"Pugwash Conference,\" which was a gathering of\r\npro-Soviet propagandists, called scientists, from red China, the Soviet\r\nUnion, and Western nations.\r\n\r\nAnother Pugwash Conference was held in 1957; and from these Pugwash\r\nConferences, the idea for a Sane Nuclear Policy, Inc., emerged.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSane Nuclear Policy, Inc., was founded in November, 1957, with national\r\nheadquarters in New York City, and with Bertrand Russell of England and\r\nSwedish socialist Gunnar Myrdal (among others) as honorary sponsors.\r\n\r\nOfficers of Sane Nuclear Policy, Inc., are largely second-level\r\naffiliates of the Council on Foreign Relations, with a good\r\nrepresentation from the CFR itself. Here are past and present officials\r\nof SANE, who are also members of the Council on Foreign Relations: Harry\r\nA. Bullis, Henry Seidel Canby, Norman Cousins, Clark M. Eichelberger,\r\nLewis Mumford, Earl D. Osborn, Elmo Roper, James T. Shotwell, James P.\r\nWarburg.\r\n\r\nOther national officials of SANE, who are not members of the CFR, but\r\nworthy of note, are: Steve Allen, Harry Belafonte, Walt Kelly, Martin\r\nLuther King, Linus Pauling, Norman Thomas, Bruno Walter.\r\n\r\nA typical activity of SANE was a public rally at Madison Square Garden\r\nin New York City on May 19, 1960, featuring speeches by Eleanor\r\nRoosevelt, Walter Reuther, Norman Thomas, Alf Landon, Israel Goldstein,\r\nand G. Mennen Williams. All speakers demanded disarmament and\r\nstrengthening the United Nations until it becomes strong enough to\r\nmaintain world peace.\r\n\r\nCommenting on this SANE rally at Madison Square Garden, Senator James O.\r\nEastland, Chairman of the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee said (in\r\na press release from his office, dated October 12, 1960):\r\n\r\n     \"The communists publicized the meeting well in advance through\r\n     their own and sympathetic periodicals.... The affair, in Madison\r\n     Square Garden May 19, was sponsored by the Committee for a Sane\r\n     Nuclear Policy.... Chief organizer of the Garden meeting, however,\r\n     was one Henry H. Abrams of 11 Riverside Drive, New York, New York,\r\n     who was a veteran member of the communist party.... It is to the\r\n     credit of the officers of the organization that, when Abrams'\r\n     record of communist connections was brought to their attention,\r\n     Abrams was immediately discharged.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFREE EUROPE COMMITTEE\r\n\r\nThe Free Europe Committee, Inc., was founded in New York, primarily by\r\nHerbert H. Lehman (then United States Senator) in 1949. Its revenue\r\ncomes from the big foundations (principally, Ford) and from annual\r\nfund-raising drives conducted in the name of Crusade for Freedom. The\r\nmain activity of The Free Europe Committee (apart from the fund raising)\r\nis the running of Radio Free Europe and Free Europe Press.\r\n\r\nEvery year, Crusade for Freedom (with major assistance from Washington\r\nofficialdom) conducts a vigorous nationwide drive, pleading for \"truth\r\ndollars\" from the American people to finance the activities of Radio\r\nFree Europe and Free Europe Press, which are supposed to be fighting\r\ncommunism behind the iron curtain by spreading the truth about communism\r\nto people in the captive satellite nations.\r\n\r\nIt is widely known among well-informed anti-communists, however, that\r\nRadio Free Europe actually helps, rather than hurts, the cause of\r\ninternational communism--particularly in the captive nations.\r\n\r\nRadio Free Europe broadcasts tell the people behind the iron curtain\r\nthat communism is bad--as if they did not know this better than the RFE\r\nbroadcasters do; but the broadcasts consistently support the programs,\r\nand present the ideology, of international socialism, always advocating\r\nthe equivalent of a one-world socialist society as the solution to all\r\nproblems. This is, of course, the communist solution. And it is also the\r\nsolution desired by the Council on Foreign Relations.\r\n\r\nA bill of particulars which reveals that Radio Free Europe helps rather\r\nthan hurts communism with its so-called \"anti-communist\" broadcasts can\r\nbe found in the _Congressional Record_ for June 20, 1956. An article,\r\nbeginning on page A4908, was put in the _Record_ by former Congressman\r\nAlbert H. Bosch, of New York. It was written by George Brada, a\r\nCzechoslovakian who fled his homeland after the communists had taken\r\nover in 1948. Brada now lives in Western Germany and is active in a\r\nnumber of anti-communist groups in Western Europe.\r\n\r\nIn reality, the Free Europe Committee and its subsidiary organizations\r\nconstitute another propaganda front for the Council on Foreign\r\nRelations. Here, for example, are the CFR members who are, or have been,\r\ntop officials of Free Europe Committee, Crusade for Freedom, or Radio\r\nFree Europe--or all three: Adolf A. Berle, David K. E. Bruce, General\r\nLucius D. Clay, Will L. Clayton, Allen W. Dulles, Dwight D. Eisenhower,\r\nMark F. Ethridge, Julius Fleischmann, Henry Ford II, Walter S. Gifford,\r\nJoseph C. Grew, Palmer Hoyt, C. D. Jackson, Herbert H. Lehman, Henry R.\r\nLuce, Edward R. Murrow, Irving S. Olds, Arthur W. Page, David Sarnoff,\r\nWhitney H. Shepardson, George N. Shuster, Charles M. Spofford, Harold E.\r\nStassen, H. Gregory Thomas, Walter H. Wheeler, Jr.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF COLORED PEOPLE\r\n\r\nThe Council on Foreign Relations has had a strong (though, probably, not\r\ncontrolling) hand in the NAACP. Felix Frankfurter, CFR member, was an\r\nattorney for the NAACP for ten years. Other CFR members who are, or\r\nwere, officials of the NAACP: Ralph Bunche, Norman Cousins, Lewis S.\r\nGannett, John Hammond, Herbert H. Lehman.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN COMMITTEE ON AFRICA\r\n\r\nThe American Committee on Africa is a propaganda agency which\r\nconcentrates on condemning the apartheid policies of the government of\r\nthe Union of South Africa--a nation of white people (practically\r\nencircled by millions of black savages), who feel that their racial\r\npolicies are their only hope of avoiding total submergence and\r\ndestruction. In addition to disseminating propaganda to create ill-will\r\nfor South Africa among Americans, the American Committee on Africa gives\r\nfinancial assistance to agitators and revolutionaries in the Union of\r\nSouth Africa.\r\n\r\nIt has, for example, given financial aid to 156 persons charged with\r\ntreason under the laws of the Union.\r\n\r\nHere are some of the Council on Foreign Relations members who are\r\nofficials of the American Committee on Africa: Gardner Cowles, Lewis S.\r\nGannett, John Gunther, Senator Hubert H. Humphrey, Dr. Robert L.\r\nJohnson, Dr. Reinhold Niebuhr, Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. Mrs. Chester\r\nBowles is also an official.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORLD POPULATION EMERGENCY CAMPAIGN\r\n\r\nThe World Population Emergency Campaign urges the United States\r\ngovernment to use American tax money in an effort to solve the world\r\npopulation problem. It specifically endorses the 1959 Draper Report on\r\nforeign aid, which recommended that the United States appropriate money\r\nfor a United Nations population control project.\r\n\r\nLeadership of the World Population Emergency Campaign is dominated by\r\nsuch CFR members as: Will L. Clayton, Lammot DuPont Copeland, Major\r\nGeneral William H. Draper, John Nuveen. Most of the members of the\r\n\"Campaign\" also belong to the Atlantic Union Committee, or to some other\r\nsecond-level affiliate of the CFR.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHOOL OF INTERNATIONAL SERVICE\r\n\r\nThe School of International Service at American University in\r\nWashington, D. C., initiated a new academic program to train foreign\r\nservice officers and other officials in newly independent nations,\r\ncommencing in September, 1961. The foreign diplomats will study courses\r\non land reforms, finance, labor problems, and several courses on Soviet\r\nand Chinese communism. The program (under the newly created Center of\r\nDiplomacy and Foreign Policy) is directed by former Under Secretary of\r\nState Loy W. Henderson, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION\r\n\r\nIn 1919, Elihu Root and Stephen Duggan (both members of the Council on\r\nForeign Relations) founded the Institute of International Education, to\r\ndevelop international understanding and goodwill through exchange of\r\nstudents, teachers, and others in the educational field.\r\n\r\nPrior to World War II, the Institute was financed by the Carnegie\r\nCorporation. Since the War, the federal government has contributed a\r\nlittle more than one-third of the Institute's annual income of about 1.8\r\nmillion dollars. Foundations, corporations, individuals, and colleges,\r\ncontribute the rest.\r\n\r\nThe Institute is wholly a CFR operation. Its officials are: Stanley C.\r\nAllyn, Edward W. Barrett, Chester Bowles, Ralph J. Bunche, William C.\r\nFoster, Arthur A. Houghton, Grayson L. Kirk, Edward R. Murrow, George N.\r\nShuster, and James D. Zellerbach--all members of the CFR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 10\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATIONS MEDIA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn nine chapters of this Volume, I have managed to discuss only a few of\r\nthe most powerful organizations interlocked with the Council on Foreign\r\nRelations, to form an amazing web which is the invisible government of\r\nthe United States. There are scores of such organizations.\r\n\r\nI have managed to name, relatively, only a few of the influential\r\nindividuals who are members of the Council on Foreign Relations, or of\r\naffiliated agencies, and who also occupy key jobs in the executive\r\nbranch of government, including the Presidency.\r\n\r\nI have asserted that the objective of the invisible government is to\r\nconvert America into a socialist nation and then make it a unit in a\r\none-world socialist system.\r\n\r\nThe managers of the combine do not admit this, of course. They are\r\n\"liberals\" who say that the old \"negative\" kind of government we used to\r\nhave is inadequate for this century. The liberals' \"positive\" foreign\r\npolicy is said to be necessary for \"world peace\" and for meeting\r\n\"America's responsibility\" in the world. Their \"positive\" domestic\r\npolicies are said to be necessary for the continued improvement and\r\nprogress of our \"free-enterprise\" system.\r\n\r\nBut the \"positive\" foreign policy for peace has dragged us into so many\r\ninternational commitments (many of which are in direct conflict with\r\neach other: such as, our subsidizing national independence for former\r\ncolonies of European powers, while we are also subsidizing the European\r\npowers trying to keep the colonies) that, if we continue in our present\r\ndirection, we will inevitably find ourselves in perpetual war for\r\nperpetual peace--or we will surrender our freedom and national\r\nindependence and become an out-voted province in a socialist one-world\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThe liberals' \"positive\" domestic policies always bring the federal\r\ngovernment into the role of subsidizing and controlling the economic\r\nactivities of the people; and that is the known highway to the total,\r\ntyrannical socialist state.\r\n\r\nThe Council on Foreign Relations is rapidly achieving its purpose. An\r\nobvious reason for its success: it is reaching the American public with\r\nits clever propaganda.\r\n\r\nHowever much power the CFR combine may have inside the agencies of\r\ngovernment; however extensive the reach of its propaganda through\r\norganizations designed to \"educate\" the public to acceptance of CFR\r\nideas--the CFR needs to reach the _mass_ audience of Americans who do\r\nnot belong to, or attend the meetings of, or read material distributed\r\nby, the propaganda organizations. Council on Foreign Relations leaders\r\nare aware of this need, and they have met it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the 1957 Annual Report of the Committee for Economic Development (a\r\nmajor propaganda arm of the CFR), Gardner Cowles, then Chairman of CED's\r\nInformation Committee, did a bit of boasting about how successful CED\r\nhad been in communicating its ideas to the general public. Mr. Cowles\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     \"The value of CED's research and recommendations is directly\r\n     related to its ability to communicate them ... the organization's\r\n     role as an agency that can influence private and public economic\r\n     policies and decisions ... can be effective ... only to the extent\r\n     that CED gets its ideas across to thinking people....\r\n\r\n     \"During the year [1957], the Information Division [of CED]\r\n     distributed 42 pamphlets having a total circulation of 545,585;\r\n     issued 37 press releases and texts of statements; arranged 4 press\r\n     conferences, 10 radio and television appearances, 12 speeches for\r\n     Trustees, 3 magazine articles and the publication of 3 books.... In\r\n     assessing the year, we are reminded again of the great debt we owe\r\n     the nation's editors. Their regard for the objectivity and\r\n     non-partisanship of CED's work is reflected in the exceptional\r\n     attention they give to what CED has to say. The [CED] statement,\r\n     'Toward a Realistic Farm Policy,' for example not only received\r\n     extended news treatment but was the subject of 362 editorials. The\r\n     circulation represented in the editorials alone totaled\r\n     19,336,299.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Cowles was modest. He gave only a hint of the total extent to which\r\nthe mass-communication media have become a controlled propaganda network\r\nfor the Council on Foreign Relations and its inter-connecting agencies.\r\n\r\nI doubt that anyone really knows the full extent. My research reveals a\r\nfew of the CFR members who have (or have had) controlling, or extremely\r\ninfluential, positions in the publishing and broadcasting industries. My\r\nlist of _CFR members_ in this field is far from complete; and I have not\r\ntried to compile a list of the thousands of people who are _not_ members\r\nof the CFR, but who _are_ members of CED, FPA, or of some other CFR\r\naffiliate--and who also control important channels of public\r\ncommunications.\r\n\r\nHence, the following list--of Council on Foreign Relations members whom\r\nI know to be influential in the communications industries--is intended\r\nto be indicative, rather than comprehensive and informative:\r\n\r\n     Herbert Agar (former Editor, _Louisville Courier-Journal_)\r\n\r\n     Hanson W.

L. Sulzberger (Editorial writer, _New York Times_)\r\n\r\nI do not mean to imply that all of these people are controlled by the\r\nCouncil on Foreign Relations, or that they uniformly support the total\r\nprogram of international socialism which the Council wants. The Council\r\ndoes not _own_ its members: it merely has varying degrees of influence\r\non each.\r\n\r\nFor example, former President Herbert Hoover, a member of the Council,\r\nhas fought eloquently against many basic policies which the Council\r\nsupports. Spruille Braden is another.\r\n\r\nMr. Braden formerly held several important ambassadorial posts and at\r\none time was Assistant Secretary of State in charge of American Republic\r\nAffairs. In recent years, Mr. Braden has given leadership to many\r\npatriotic organizations and efforts, such as For America and The John\r\nBirch Society; and, in testimony before various committees of Congress,\r\nhe has given much valuable information about communist influences in the\r\nState Department.\r\n\r\nMr. Braden joined the Council on Foreign Relations in the late 1920's or\r\nearly 30's, when membership in the Council was a fashionable badge of\r\nrespectability, helpful to the careers of young men in the foreign\r\nservice, in the same way that membership in expensive country clubs and\r\nsimilar organizations is considered helpful to the careers of young\r\nbusiness executives.\r\n\r\nMen who know Braden well say that he stayed in the Council after he came\r\nto realize its responsibility for the policies of disaster which our\r\nnation has followed in the postwar era--hoping to exert some\r\npro-American influence inside the Council.\r\n\r\nIt apparently was a frustrated hope. There is a story in well-informed\r\nNew York circles about the last time the Council on Foreign Relations\r\never called on Spruille Braden to participate in an important activity.\r\nBraden was asked to preside over a Council on Foreign Relations meeting\r\nwhen the featured speaker was Herbert Matthews (member of the _New York\r\nTimes_ editorial board) whose support of communist Castro in Cuba is\r\nnotorious. It is said that the anti-communist viewpoint which Braden\r\ntried to inject into this meeting will rather well guarantee against his\r\never being asked to officiate at another CFR affair.\r\n\r\nGenerally, however, the degree of influence which the CFR exerts upon\r\nits own members is very high indeed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nApart from an occasional article or editorial which criticizes some\r\naspect of, or some leader in, the socialist revolution in America; and\r\ndespite much rhetoric in praise of \"free enterprise\" and \"the American\r\nway,\" such publications as _Time_, _Life_, _Fortune_, _New York Times_,\r\n_New York Post_, _Louisville Courier-Journal_, _Washington Post and\r\nTimes Herald_, _Saturday Review of Literature_, the _Denver Post_, _The\r\nChristian Science Monitor_ and _Look_ (I name only those, in the list\r\nabove, which I, personally, have read a great deal.) have not one time\r\nin the past 15 years spoken editorially against any fundamentally\r\nimportant aspect of the over-all governmental policies which are\r\ndragging this nation into socialism and world government--at least, not\r\nto my knowledge.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, these publications heartily support those policies,\r\ncriticizing them, if at all, only about some detail--or for being too\r\ntimid, small and slow!\r\n\r\nIn contrast, David Lawrence, of _U. S. News & World Report_, publishes\r\nfine, objective news-reporting, often featuring articles which factually\r\nexpose the costly fallacies of governmental policy. This is especially\r\ntrue of _U. S. News & World Report_ in connection with domestic issues.\r\nOn matters of foreign policy, David Lawrence often goes down the line\r\nfor the internationalist policy--being convinced (as all\r\ninternationalists seem to be) that this is the only policy possible for\r\nAmerica in the \"shrunken world\" of the twentieth century.\r\n\r\nAn intelligent man like David Lawrence--who must see the endless and\r\nunbroken chain of disasters which the internationalist foreign policy\r\nhas brought to America; and who is thoroughly familiar with the proven\r\nrecord of marvelous success which our traditional policy of benign\r\nneutrality and no-permanent-involvement enjoyed: how can he still feel\r\nthat we are nonetheless inescapably bound to follow the policy of\r\ndisaster? I wish I knew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 11\r\n\r\nINTERLOCKING UNTOUCHABLES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMembers of Congress are not unaware of the far-reaching power of the\r\ntax-exempt private organization--the CFR; but the power of the Council\r\nis somewhat indicated by the fact that no committee of Congress has yet\r\nbeen powerful enough to investigate it or the foundations with which it\r\nhas interlocking connections and from which it receives its support.\r\n\r\nOn August 1, 1951, Congressman E. E. Cox (Democrat, Georgia) introduced\r\na resolution in the House asking for a Committee to conduct a thorough\r\ninvestigation of tax-exempt foundations. Congressman Cox said that some\r\nof the great foundations,\r\n\r\n     \"had operated in the field of social reform and international\r\n     relations (and) many have brought down on themselves harsh and just\r\n     condemnation.\"\r\n\r\nHe named the Rockefeller Foundation,\r\n\r\n     \"whose funds have been used to finance individuals and\r\n     organizations whose business it has been to get communism into the\r\n     private and public schools of the country, to talk down America and\r\n     to play up Russia.\"\r\n\r\nHe cited the Guggenheim Foundation, whose money,\r\n\r\n     \"was used to spread radicalism throughout the country to an extent\r\n     not excelled by any other foundation.\"\r\n\r\nHe listed the Carnegie Corporation, The Rosenwald Fund, and other\r\nfoundations, saying:\r\n\r\n     \"There are disquieting evidences that at least a few of the\r\n     foundations have permitted themselves to be infiltrated by men and\r\n     women who are disloyal to our American way of life. They should be\r\n     investigated and exposed to the pitiless light of publicity, and\r\n     appropriate legislation should be framed to correct the present\r\n     situation.\"\r\n\r\nCongressman Cox's resolution, proposing an investigation of foundations,\r\ndied in Committee.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn March 10, 1952, Cox introduced the same resolution again. Because he\r\nhad mentioned foundation support for Langston Hughes, a Negro communist,\r\nCongressman Cox was accused of racial prejudice. Because he had\r\ncriticized the Rosenwald Fund for making grants to known communists, he\r\nwas called anti-semitic. But the Cox resolution was adopted in 1952; and\r\nthe Cox committee to investigate tax-exempt foundations was set up.\r\n\r\nCongressman Cox died before the end of the year; and the final report of\r\nhis committee (filed January 1, 1953) was a pathetic whitewash of the\r\nwhole subject.\r\n\r\nA Republican-controlled Congress (the 83rd) came into existence in\r\nJanuary, 1953.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn April 23, 1953, the late Congressman Carroll Reece, (Republican,\r\nTennessee) introduced a resolution proposing a committee to carry on the\r\n\"unfinished business\" of the defunct Cox Committee. The new committee to\r\ninvestigate tax-exempt foundations (popularly known as the Reece\r\nCommittee) was approved by Congress on July 27, 1953. It went out of\r\nexistence on January 3, 1955, having proven, mainly, that the mammoth\r\ntax-exempt foundations have such power in the White House, in Congress,\r\nand in the press that they are quite beyond the reach of a mere\r\ncommittee of the Congress of the United States.\r\n\r\nIf you want to read this whole incredible (and rather terrifying) story,\r\nI suggest _Foundations_, a book written by Rene A. Wormser who was\r\ngeneral counsel to the Reece Committee. His book was published in 1958\r\nby The Devin-Adair Company.\r\n\r\nIn the final report on Tax-Exempt Foundations, which the late\r\nCongressman Reece made for his ill-fated Special Committee (Report\r\npublished December 16, 1954, by the Government Printing Office), Mr.\r\nReece said:\r\n\r\n     \"Miss Casey's report (Hearings pp. 877, et seq.) shows clearly the\r\n     interlock between _The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace_,\r\n     and some of its associated organizations, such as the _Council on\r\n     Foreign Relations_ and other foundations, with the State\r\n     Department. Indeed, these foundations and organizations would not\r\n     dream of denying this interlock. They proudly note it in reports.\r\n     They have undertaken vital research projects for the Department;\r\n     virtually created minor departments or groups within the Department\r\n     for it; supplied advisors and executives from their ranks; fed a\r\n     constant stream of personnel into the State Department trained by\r\n     themselves or under programs which they have financed; and have had\r\n     much to do with the formulation of foreign policy both in principle\r\n     and detail.\r\n\r\n     \"They have, to a marked degree, acted as direct agents of the State\r\n     Department. And they have engaged actively, and with the\r\n     expenditure of enormous sums, in propagandizing ('educating'?)\r\n     public opinion in support of the policies which they have helped to\r\n     formulate....\r\n\r\n     \"What we see here is a number of large foundations, primarily _The\r\n     Rockefeller Foundation_, _The Carnegie Corporation of New York_,\r\n     and the _Carnegie Endowment for International Peace_, using their\r\n     enormous public funds to finance a one-sided approach to foreign\r\n     policy and to promote it actively, among the public by propaganda,\r\n     and in the Government through infiltration. The power to do this\r\n     comes out of the power of the vast funds employed.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Reece listed The Council on Foreign Relations, The Institute of\r\nInternational Education, The Foreign Policy Association, and The\r\nInstitute of Pacific Relations, as among the interlocking organizations\r\nwhich are \"agencies of these foundations,\" and pointed out that research\r\nand propaganda which does not support the \"globalism\" (or\r\ninternationalism) to which all of these agencies are dedicated, receive\r\nlittle support from the tax-exempt foundations.\r\n\r\nI disagree with Mr. Reece here, only in the placing of emphasis. As I\r\nsee it, the foundations (which do finance the vast, complex, and\r\npowerful interlock of organizations devoted to a socialist one-world\r\nsystem) have, nonetheless, become the \"agencies\" of the principal\r\norganization which they finance--the Council on Foreign Relations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Reece Committee investigation threw some revealing light on the\r\nhistorical blackout which the Council on Foreign Relations has ordered\r\nand conducted.\r\n\r\nMen who run the Council do not want the policies and measures of\r\nFranklin D. Roosevelt to undergo the critical analysis and objective\r\nstudy which exposed the policies of Woodrow Wilson after World War I.\r\nThe Council has decided that the official propaganda of World War II\r\nmust be perpetuated as history and the public protected from learning\r\nthe truth. Hence, the Council sponsors historical works which give the\r\nsocialist-internationalist version of historical events prior to and\r\nduring World War II, while ignoring, or debunking, revisionist studies\r\nwhich attempt to tell the truth.\r\n\r\nHere is how all of this is put in the 1946 Annual Report of the\r\nRockefeller Foundation:\r\n\r\n     \"The Committee on Studies of the Council on Foreign Relations is\r\n     concerned that the debunking journalistic campaign following World\r\n     War I should not be repeated and believes that the American public\r\n     deserves a clear competent statement of our basic aims and\r\n     activities during the second World War.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1946, the Rockefeller Foundation allotted $139,000 to the cost of a\r\ntwo-volume history of World War II, written by William L. Langer, a\r\nmember of the CFR, and S. Everett Gleason. The generous grant was\r\nsupplemented by a gift of $10,000 from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.\r\nThe Langer-Gleason work was published by Harper and Brothers for the\r\nCouncil on Foreign Relations: Volume I in 1952 under the title, _The\r\nChallenge To Isolationism, 1937-1940_; Volume II in 1953, under the\r\ntitle, _The Undeclared War_.\r\n\r\nThe CFR's stated purpose in bringing out this work was to head off the\r\nrevisionist historians like Charles Callan Tansill, Harry Elmer Barnes,\r\nFrederic R. Sanborn, George Morgenstern, Frances Neilson. The truth,\r\nhowever, is not easy to suppress. Though written by and for the CFR, to\r\nperpetuate that organization's version of history, the Langer-Gleason\r\nvolumes contain a wealth of information which helps to prove the basic\r\nthesis of this present volume.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne thing that the ill-fated Reece Committee found out in 1953-55, when\r\ntrying to investigate the foundations, is that the tax-exempt\r\norganizations are set up, not for the purpose of doing some good in our\r\nsociety, but for the purpose of avoiding the income tax.\r\n\r\nRene A. Wormser, in _Foundation_ says:\r\n\r\n     \"The chief motivation in the creation of foundations has long\r\n     ceased to be pure philanthropy--it is now predominantly tax\r\n     avoidance.... The increasing tax burden on income and estates has\r\n     greatly accelerated a trend toward creation of foundations as\r\n     instruments for the retention of control over capital assets that\r\n     would otherwise be lost....\r\n\r\n     \"The creation of a new foundation very often serves the purpose of\r\n     contributing to a favorable public opinion for the person or\r\n     corporation that endows it....\"\r\n\r\nThe tax-exempt organizations have a vested interest in the oppressive,\r\ninequitable, and wasteful federal-income-tax system. Tax experts have\r\ndevised, for example, a complicated scheme by which a wealthy man can\r\nactually save money by giving to tax-exempt organizations.\r\n\r\nIn short, many of the great philanthropies which buy fame and\r\nrespectability for wealthy individuals, or corporations, are\r\ntax-avoidance schemes which, every year, add billions to the billions of\r\nprivate capital which is thus sterilized. These accumulations of\r\ntax-exempt billions place a heavier burden on taxpayers. Removing\r\nbillions from taxation, the tax-exempt organizations thus obviously make\r\ntaxpayers pay more in order to produce all that government demands.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe big tax-exempt organizations use their tax-exempt billions to buy\r\nprestige and power for themselves, and to bludgeon some critics into\r\nsilence. For example, the Ford Foundation established the Fund for the\r\nRepublic with a 15 million dollar grant in 1952--at a time when public\r\nawareness of the communist danger was seeping into the thinking of\r\nenough Americans to create a powerful anti-communist movement in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nBy late 1955, the Fund's activities (publicly granting awards to\r\nfifth-amendment communists and so on) had become so blatant that public\r\nindignation was rising significantly. Just at the right time, the Ford\r\nFoundation announced a gift of 500 million dollars to the colleges of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nNewspapers--also beholden in many ways to the big foundations--which\r\nwill not publish news about the foundations' anti-American activities,\r\ngive banner headlines to the lavish benefactions for purposes\r\nuniversally believed to be good.\r\n\r\nWhere will you find a college administration that will not defend the\r\nFord Foundation against all critics--if the college has just received,\r\nor is in line to receive, a million-dollar gift from the Foundation?\r\n\r\nHow far must you search to find college professors or school teachers\r\nwho will not defend the Foundation which gives 25 million dollars at one\r\ntime, to raise the salaries of professors or school teachers?\r\n\r\nWhere will you find a plain John Doe citizen who is not favorably\r\nimpressed that the hospitals and colleges in his community have received\r\na multi-million dollar gift from a big foundation?\r\n\r\nEvery significant movement to destroy the American way of life has been\r\ndirected and financed, in whole or in part, by tax-exempt organizations,\r\nwhich are entrenched in public opinion as benefactors of our society.\r\n\r\nWorst of all: this tremendous power and prestige are in the hands of\r\nwhat Rene Wormser calls a special elite--a group of eggheads like Robert\r\nHutchins (or worse) who neither understand nor respect the\r\nprofit-motivated economic principles and the great political ideal of\r\nindividual-freedom-under-limited-government which made our nation great.\r\n\r\nOverlapping of personnel clearly shows a tight interlock between the\r\nCouncil on Foreign Relations and the big foundations.\r\n\r\nThe following information, concerning assets and officers of\r\nfoundations, all comes from _The Foundation Directory_, prepared by The\r\nFoundation Library Center and published by the Russell Sage Foundation,\r\nNew York City, 1960.\r\n\r\nFORD FOUNDATION: Assets totaling $3,316,000,000.00 (3 billion, 316\r\nmillion) on September 30, 1959. The Trustees of the Ford Foundation are:\r\nEugene R. Black (CFR); James B. Black; James F. Brownlee; John Cowles\r\n(CFR); Donald K. David (CFR); Mark F. Ethridge (CFR); Benson Ford; Henry\r\nFord II; H. Rowan Gaither, Jr. (CFR); Laurence M. Gould (CFR); Henry T.\r\nHeald (CFR); Roy E. Larsen; John J. McCloy (CFR); Julius A.

WHAT CAN WE DO?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClaiming to believe in the high destiny of America as a world-leader,\r\nour invisible government urges timid policies of appeasement and\r\nsurrender which make America a world whipping-boy rather than a world\r\nleader. Claiming to believe in the dignity and worth of the human\r\nindividual, the modern liberals who run our invisible government urge an\r\never-growing welfare-state which is destroying individualism--which has\r\nalready so weakened the American sense of personal responsibility that\r\ncrime rates have increased 98 percent in our land during the past ten\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nWhy? Why do prominent Americans support programs which are so harmful?\r\nIt is a difficult question to answer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSomewhere at the top of the pyramid in the invisible government are a\r\nfew sinister people who know exactly what they are doing: they want\r\nAmerica to become part of a worldwide socialist dictatorship, under the\r\ncontrol of the Kremlin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome may actually dislike communists, but feel that one-world socialism\r\nis desirable and inevitable. They are working with a sense of urgency\r\nfor a \"benign\" world socialist dictatorship to forestall the Kremlin\r\nfrom imposing its brand of world dictatorship by force.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome leaders in the invisible government are brilliant and power-hungry\r\nmen who feel that the masses are unable to govern themselves and who\r\nwant to set up a great dictatorship which will give them power to\r\narrange things for the masses.\r\n\r\nThe leadership of the invisible government doubtless rests in the hands\r\nof a sinister or power-hungry few; but its real strength is in the\r\nthousands of Americans who have been drawn into the web for other\r\nreasons. Many, if not most, of these are status-seekers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen you are a rising junior executive, or a man of any age looking for\r\ngood business and social connections, it seems good to go to a luncheon\r\nwhere you can sit at the head table and call leaders of the community by\r\ntheir first names. Most of the propaganda agencies affiliated with the\r\nCouncil on Foreign Relations provide such opportunities for members.\r\n\r\nA businessman enjoys coming home from a black-tie affair in New York or\r\nWashington where he and a few other \"chosen\" men have been given a\r\n\"confidential, off-the-record briefing\" by some high governmental\r\nofficial. The Council on Foreign Relations provides such experiences for\r\nofficials of companies which contribute money to the CFR.\r\n\r\nThis status-seeking is a way of life for thousands of American\r\nbusinessmen. Some of them would not give it up even if they knew their\r\nactivities were supporting the socialist revolution, although at heart\r\nthey are opposed to socialism. Most of them, however, would withdraw\r\nfrom the Foreign Policy Association, and the World Affairs Councils, and\r\nthe Committee for Economic Development, and the American Association for\r\nthe UN, and the National Conference of Christians and Jews, and the\r\nAdvertising Council, and similar organizations, if they were educated to\r\nan understanding of what their membership in such organizations really\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\nThe job of every American who knows and cares is to make sure that all\r\nof the people in the invisible government network know exactly what they\r\nare doing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut beyond that, what can we do? What can we Americans do about the\r\nCouncil on Foreign Relations and its countless tentacles of power and\r\nmoney and influence and propaganda which are wrapped around all the\r\nlevers of political power in Washington; which reach into the schools\r\nand churches and respected civic organizations of America; which control\r\nmajor media of communications; which are insinuated into controlling\r\npositions in the big unions; and which even have a grip on the prestige\r\nand money of major American corporations?\r\n\r\nIt is often suggested that investigation by the FBI might be the answer.\r\n\r\nFor example, after the March-April Term (1960) Grand Jury in Fulton\r\nCounty, Georgia, condemned Foreign Policy Association literature as\r\n\"insidious and subversive\" and the American Legion Post published _The\r\nTruth About The Foreign Policy Association_ to document the Grand Jury's\r\nfindings (see Chapter V), supporters of the Foreign Policy Association\r\ndenounced the legionnaires, saying, in effect, that if there were a need\r\nto investigate the FPA, the investigation should be done in proper,\r\nlegal manner by trained FBI professionals and not by \"vigilantes\" and\r\n\"amateurs\" and \"bigoted ignoramuses\" on some committee of an American\r\nLegion Post.\r\n\r\nThis is an effective propaganda technique. It gives many the idea that\r\nthe organization under criticism has nothing to hide and is willing to\r\nhave all its activities thoroughly investigated, if the investigation is\r\nconducted properly and decently.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut the fact is that the FBI has no jurisdiction to investigate the kind\r\nof activities engaged in by the Foreign Policy Association and its\r\nrelated and affiliated organizations. The Foreign Policy Association is\r\nnot a _communist_ organization. If it were, it could be handled easily.\r\nThe Attorney General and the committees of Congress could simply post it\r\nas a communist organization. Then, it would receive support only from\r\npeople who are conscious instruments of the communist conspiracy; and\r\nthere are not, relatively, very many of those in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe FPA's Councils on World Affairs are supported by patriotic community\r\nleaders. Yet, these Councils have done more than all _communists_ have\r\never managed to do, in brainwashing the American people with propaganda\r\n_for_ governmental intervention in the economic affairs of the people,\r\nand _for_ endless permanent entanglement in the affairs of foreign\r\nnations--thus preparing this nation _for_ submergence in a one-world\r\nsocialist system, which is the objective of communism.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the invisible government is composed of organizations which\r\nenjoy the special privilege of federal tax-exemption (a privilege seldom\r\ngiven to organizations advocating return to traditional American\r\npolicies) it is often suggested that public pressures might persuade the\r\nTreasury Department to withdraw the tax-exempt privilege from these\r\norganizations.\r\n\r\nHow could the Treasury Department ever be persuaded to take action\r\nagainst the Council on Foreign Relations, when the Council controls the\r\nDepartment? Douglas Dillon, Secretary of the Treasury, is a member of\r\nthe CFR.\r\n\r\nIt is impractical to think of getting Treasury Department action against\r\nthe CFR. Moreover, such a solution to the problem could be dangerous.\r\n\r\nA governmental agency which has limitless power to withdraw special\r\ntax-privileges must also have limitless power to grant special\r\nprivileges. The Treasury Department could destroy all of the\r\norganizations composing the invisible government interlock by the simple\r\naction of withdrawing the tax-exempt privilege, thus drying up major\r\nsources of revenue. But the Treasury Department could then create\r\nanother Frankenstein monster by giving tax-exemption to other\r\norganizations.\r\n\r\nIt is often suggested that some congressional committee investigate the\r\nCouncil on Foreign Relations and the network of organizations\r\ninterlocked with it.\r\n\r\nYet, as we have seen, two different committees of Congress--one\r\nDemocrat-controlled and one Republican-controlled--_have tried_ to\r\ninvestigate the big tax-exempt foundations which are interlocked with,\r\nand controlled by, and provide the primary source of revenue for, the\r\nCouncil on Foreign Relations and its affiliates.\r\n\r\nBoth committees were gutted with ridicule and vicious denunciation, not\r\njust by the official communist party press, but by internationalists in\r\nthe Congress, by spokesmen for the executive branch of government, and\r\nby big respected publishing and broadcasting firms which are a part of\r\nthe controlled propaganda network of the Council on Foreign Relations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe invisible government is not, however, beyond the reach of the whole\r\nCongress, _if_ the Congress has the spur and support of an informed\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nOur only hope lies in the Congress which _is_ responsive to public will,\r\nwhen that will is fully and insistently expressed.\r\n\r\nEvery time I suggest that aroused citizens write their Congressmen and\r\nSenators, I get complaints from people who say they have been writing\r\nfor years and that it does no good.\r\n\r\nYet, remember the Connally Reservation issue in January, 1960. The\r\nHumphrey Resolution (to repeal the Connally Reservation and thus permit\r\nthe World Court to assume unlimited jurisdiction over American affairs)\r\nwas before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The Chairman of this\r\nCommittee was J. William Fulbright (Democrat, Arkansas) a Rhodes-scholar\r\ninternationalist, determined to repeal the Connally Reservation. Leaders\r\nin Congress and in the Administration were determined to repeal the\r\nConnally Reservation, and so was the invisible government of the United\r\nStates--which means that the vast thought-controlling machine of the CFR\r\n(radio and television networks; major newspapers and magazines; and an\r\nimposing array of civic, church, professional, and \"educational\"\r\norganizations) had been in high gear for many months, saturating the\r\npublic with \"world-peace-through-world-law\" propaganda intended to shame\r\nand scare the public into accepting repeal of the Connally Reservation.\r\n\r\nBut word got out, and the American public positively Stunned Congress\r\nwith protests. Fulbright let the resolution die in committee.\r\n\r\nThe expression of public will was massive and explosive in connection\r\nwith the Connally Reservation, whereas in connection with many other\r\nequally important issues, the public seems indifferent. The reason is\r\nthat the Connally Reservation is a simple issue. It is easy for a voter\r\nto write or wire his elected representatives saying, \"Let's keep the\r\nConnally Reservation\"; or, \"If you vote for repeal of the Connally\r\nReservation, I'll vote against you.\"\r\n\r\nWhat kind of wire or letter can a voter send his elected representatives\r\nconcerning the bigger and more important issue which I have labeled\r\n\"Invisible Government\"?\r\n\r\nThe ultimate solution lies in many sweeping and profound changes in the\r\npolicies of government, which cannot be effected until a great many more\r\nAmericans have learned a great deal more about the American\r\nconstitutional system than they know now.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut there is certain action which the people could demand of Congress\r\nimmediately; and every Congressman and Senator who refuses to support\r\nsuch action could be voted out of office the next time he stands for\r\nre-election.\r\n\r\n     1. We should demand that Congress amend the Internal Revenue Code\r\n     in such a way that no agency of the executive branch of government\r\n     will have the power to grant federal tax-exemption. The\r\n     Constitution gives the power of _taxation_ only to the Congress.\r\n     Hence, only Congress should have the power to grant _exemption_\r\n     from taxation.\r\n\r\nInstead of permitting the Internal Revenue Service of the Treasury\r\nDepartment to decide whether a foundation or any other organization\r\nshall have federal tax-exemption, Congress should exercise this power,\r\nfully publicizing and frequently reviewing all grants of tax-exemption.\r\n\r\n     2. In addition to demanding that Congress take the power of\r\n     granting and withholding federal tax-exemption away from the\r\n     executive agencies, voters should demand that the House of\r\n     Representatives form a special committee to investigate the Council\r\n     on Foreign Relations and its associated foundations and other\r\n     organizations.\r\n\r\nThe investigation should be conducted for the same purpose that the\r\ngreat McCarran investigation of the Institute of Pacific Relations was\r\nconducted--that is, to identify the people and organizations involved\r\nand to provide an authentic record, of the invisible government's aims\r\nand programs, and personnel, for the public to see and study. Such an\r\ninvestigation, if properly conducted, would thoroughly discredit the\r\ninvisible government in the eyes of the American people.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is, however, only _one sure_ and _final_ way to stop this great\r\nand growing evil--and that is to cut it out as if it were cancerous,\r\nwhich it is. The only way to cut it out is to eliminate the income-tax\r\nsystem which spawned it.\r\n\r\nThe federal income-tax system suckles the forces which are destroying\r\nour free and independent republic. Abolish the system, and the sucklings\r\nwill die of starvation.\r\n\r\nThat is the ultimate remedy, but before we can compel Congress to\r\nprovide this remedy, we must have an educated electorate. The problem of\r\neducating the public is great--not because of the inability of the\r\npeople to understand, but because of the difficulty of reaching them\r\nwith the freedom story.\r\n\r\nIf the federal government, during the 1962 fiscal year, had not\r\ncollected one penny in tax on personal incomes, the government would\r\nstill have had more tax revenue from other sources than the _total_ of\r\nwhat Harry Truman collected in his most extravagant peacetime spending\r\nyear. Every American, who knows that, can readily understand the\r\npossibility and the necessity of repealing the federal tax on personal\r\nincomes. But how many Americans know those simple facts? The job of\r\neveryone who knows and cares is to get such facts to others.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEven if we did take action to divest the Council on Foreign Relations\r\nand its powerful interlock of control over our government; and even if\r\nwe did reverse the policies which are now dragging us into a one-world\r\nsocialist dictatorship--what would we do about some of the dangerous\r\nmesses which our policies already have us involved in? What, for\r\nexample, could we do about Cuba? About Berlin?\r\n\r\nIn some ways, the policies of our invisible government have taken us\r\nbeyond the point of no return. Consider the problem of Cuba. Armed\r\nintervention in the affairs of another nation violates the principles of\r\nthe traditional American policy of benign neutrality, to which I think\r\nour nation should return. Yet, our intervention in Cuban affairs (on the\r\nside of communism) has produced such a dangerous condition that we\r\nshould now intervene with armed might in the interest of our own\r\nsurvival.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor sixteen years, we have seen the disastrous fallacy of trying to\r\nhandle the foreign affairs of our great nation through international\r\nagencies. This leaves us without a policy of our own, and makes it\r\nimpossible for us to take any action in our own interest or against the\r\ninterests of communism, because communists have more actual votes, and\r\ninfinitely more influence, in all the international agencies than we\r\nhave. At the same time, our enemies, the communist nations, set and\r\nfollow their own policies, contemptuously ignoring the international\r\nagencies which hamstring America and bleed American taxpayers for\r\nsubsidies to our mortal enemies.\r\n\r\nAmerica must do two things soon if she expects to survive as a free and\r\nindependent nation:\r\n\r\n(1) We must withdraw from membership in all international, governmental,\r\nor quasi-governmental, organizations--including, specifically, the World\r\nCourt, the United Nations, and all UN specialized agencies. (2) We must\r\nact vigorously, unilaterally, and quickly, to protect vital American\r\nsecurity interests in the Western Hemisphere--particularly in Cuba.\r\n\r\nWe have already passed the time when we can act in Cuba easily and at no\r\nrisk; but if we have any sane, manly concern for protecting the vital\r\nsecurity of the American nation and the lives and property of United\r\nStates citizens, we had better do the only thing left for us to do: send\r\noverwhelming American military force to take Cuba over quickly, and keep\r\nit under American military occupation, as beneficently as possible,\r\nuntil the Cuban people can hold free elections to select their own\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe other nations of the world would scream; but they would,\r\nnonetheless, respect us. Such action in our own interests is the only\r\nthing that will restore our \"prestige\" in the world--and restore\r\nAmerican military security in the Western Hemisphere.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat should we do about Berlin?\r\n\r\nThe Berlin problem must be solved soon, because it is too effectively\r\nserving the purpose for which it was created in the first place: to\r\njustify whatever programs the various governments involved want to\r\npursue.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes looks as if the Kremlin and Washington officialdom are\r\nworking hand-in-glove to deceive the people of both nations, turning the\r\nBerlin \"crisis\" on and off to cover up failures and to provide excuses\r\nfor more adventures.\r\n\r\nBerlin will cause a world war only when the United States is willing to\r\ngo to war with the Soviet Union to free Berlin from the trap it is in.\r\nIf we won't defend our own vital interests against the aggressive and\r\narrogant actions of communists 90 miles from our shores, what would\r\nprompt us to cross the ocean and defend Germans from communists?\r\n\r\nThe cold fact of the matter is that we should not defend Berlin. This is\r\na job for Germans, not Americans.\r\n\r\nThe Germans are an able and prosperous people. They are capable of\r\nfighting their own war, if war is necessary to protect them from\r\ncommunism.\r\n\r\nIt is inaccurate to refer to the eastern part of Germany as \"communist\r\nGermany.\" That part of Germany is under communist enslavement; but the\r\nGermans who live there probably hate communists more than any other\r\npeople on earth do.\r\n\r\nThe uprisings of 1953, and the endless stream of refugees fleeing from\r\nthe communist zone in Germany, are proof enough that the communists\r\ncould not hold East Germany without the presence of Soviet troops.\r\n\r\nThere is enough hunger and poverty and hatred of communism in eastern\r\nGermany to justify the conclusion that even Khrushchev knows he has a\r\nbear by the tail there. If we would do our part, Khrushchev would either\r\nturn loose and run; or the bear would pull loose and destroy Khrushchev.\r\n\r\nWhat part should we play? We should do exactly what the President and\r\nthe State Department assure the world they will not do: we should\r\npresent the Soviets with a _fait accompli_, and an ultimatum.\r\n\r\nWe should call an immediate conference with the governments of France,\r\nEngland, and West Germany to explain that America has devoted 16 years\r\nand many billions of dollars to rehabilitating and defending western\r\nEurope; that Europe is now in many ways more soundly prosperous than we\r\nare; that the 180 million Americans can no longer be expected to ruin\r\ntheir own economy and neglect the defense of their own homeland for the\r\npurpose of assisting and defending the 225 million people of Western\r\nEurope; and that, therefore, we are through.\r\n\r\nWe have no need, at home, for all of the vast stores of military\r\nequipment which we now have in Europe for the defense of Europe. What we\r\ndo not need for the defense of our homeland, we should offer as a gift\r\nto West Germany, since we produced the material in the first place for\r\nthe purpose of resisting communism, and since the West Germans are the\r\nonly people in Western Europe who apparently want to resist it.\r\n\r\nWe should give the West Germans (and the other western powers) six\r\nmonths to train whatever manpower they want for manning their own\r\ndefenses. At the end of that time, we should pull out and devote\r\nourselves to defending America.\r\n\r\nWith or without the consent of France and England, we should sign a\r\npeace treaty with the government of Western Germany, recognizing it as\r\nthe lawful government of all Germany and imposing no restrictions on the\r\nsovereignty of Germany--that is, leaving Germany free to arm as it\r\npleases.\r\n\r\nImmediately following the signing of this treaty, we should announce to\r\nthe world that, when we pull out of Europe at the end of six months, we\r\nexpect the Soviets to pull out of Germany entirely. If, within one week\r\nafter we effect our withdrawal, the Soviets are not out--or if they\r\nlater come back in, against the wishes of the German nation--we should\r\nbreak off diplomatic relations with _all_ communist countries; deny all\r\nrepresentatives of all communist nations access to United Nations\r\nheadquarters which are on United States soil; and exert maximum\r\npressures throughout the world to isolate all communist countries,\r\neconomically and diplomatically, from all non-communist countries.\r\n\r\nThat is an _American_ plan, which would solve the German \"problem\" in\r\nthe interests of peace and freedom.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMany Americans, who see what the solution to our grave problems ought to\r\nbe, have lost hope that we will ever achieve such solution, because, in\r\nthe end, the solution rests with the people.\r\n\r\nIt is the people who must compel their elected representatives to make a\r\nthorough investigation of the Council on Foreign Relations and its\r\ninterlock.\r\n\r\nIt is the people who must compel Congress to deny administrative\r\nAgencies of government the unconstitutional power of granting\r\ntax-exemption.\r\n\r\nIt is the people who must compel Congress to submit a constitutional\r\namendment calling for repeal of the income tax amendment.\r\n\r\nIt is the people who must compel Washington officialdom to do what is\r\nright and best for America in foreign affairs, especially in Cuba and\r\nBerlin.\r\n\r\nMany Americans are in despair because they feel that the people will\r\nnever do these things. These pessimists seem to share the late Harry\r\nHopkins' conviction that the American people are too dumb to think.\r\n\r\nI do not believe it. I subscribe to the marvelous doctrine of Thomas\r\nJefferson, who said:\r\n\r\n     \"I know no safe depository of the ultimate powers of society but\r\n     the people themselves; and if we think them not enlightened enough\r\n     to exercise their control with a wholesome discretion, the remedy\r\n     is not to take it from them, but to inform their discretion by\r\n     education.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix\r\n\r\nCOUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS MEMBERSHIP ROSTER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis roster of membership is from the 1960-61 Annual Report of the CFR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Directors_\r\n\r\n\r\nFrank Altschul 1984-\r\nHamilton Fish Armstrong 1928-\r\nElliott V.
